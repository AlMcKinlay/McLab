[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390 first episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host s BJ with me is will it is now what the second weekend in January if you are planning on giving up on the gym that now's the time to do it friends it's time to give up and please make room for will again that's my anti clanging and banging I mean it's bad but Gregg also here also probably complaining about people at the gym well okay there's but this is like a two-fold problem this one people who actually want to make a change like who would probably enjoy the gym pick this time of year when it's just full of people and nobody knows what they're doing and so you're getting this false perspective of a super super JIT busy gym when in March there's like five of us there and that's the time to join the gym because you could actually get staff to help you to have room in the locker room right now it's just a mess of people and a lot of them are just standing around because they don't know what to do and there's not enough staff to help them it's an openness a mess of people who don't understand basic gym courtesy such as if someone is standing next to a piece of equipment facing the piece of equipment most likely they're planning on using that piece of equipment don't just go and sit on it right in front of them without even asking hey were you gonna use this oh oh I got so mad let me tell you about adventure I know I could tie that home you could you could you could you won't but you could it's even supported by Apple watch this is like makes it even better get out that Pilate son well speaking of Pilates there was a Pokemon announcement there was what I don't I don't think there was any Pilates in it though but they both start with peas so that was my transition oh is this about trade evolutions yes wait we have a Hugh good show for ya guys we're gonna get right into it actually there's some Pokemon got no news and some other news but we're actually gonna just start off with the good stuff here and [Music] build-a-bear is brick no kidding there's no build the band isn't didn't we discover that build-a-bear if you brought your Eevee in they'd rip it apart and make it into a new one I've heard that rumor yes well stuffing Andry stuff a new one with it yeah there was a Pokemon direct on january 9th and it was 20 minutes long which is one of the longest pokemon Durex ever if not the longest i think i think it was 20 minutes and 26 seconds if you were counting and i think the longest one prior to that was like 19 minutes and 26 seconds which i think was the one right before X&Y came out so there was a lot of assumptions that this was going to be in regards to Pokemon home and Pokemon sleep and ideally detective Pikachu for the switch which I think a lot of people have forgot about that that's still in development and it was not that there was also a side of people that thought that this was maybe going to be the 2020 fall game whether that was a Gen 4 remake or a Gen 2 remake an ultimate Pokemon MMO that had every verb whatever your fantasies were that was dubbed probably highly unlikely since the fastest we've ever gotten a Pokemon game after announcement after another Pokemon game was when they announced let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee what we know now know his sword and shield which is five months after Ultra Sun ultra moon as of this recording sword and shield Believe It or Not not even two months old but I guess logistically it would be really weird for them to say like hey we spent all this work in a brand new generation of Pokemon with a brand new anime that isn't even out yet and a brand new trading card game format that isn't even out yet to announce another video game they did not do that but they did something which I guess people have opinions on but this was emailed to me this is the press release that they sent out obviously it's kind of hard to cover 20 minute video so we're gonna read what they broked Pokemon Sword expansion pass in Pokemon shield expansion patch hats not patch to launch 2020 with two sets of additional content and then in subtext pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team DX for a Nintendo switch was also announced this is where you guys are gonna be like oh the oh my gosh an expansion path no I just think um I think is that the entirety of the press release it's actually long the Pokemon company international and Nintendo announced new downloadable content they call that DLC here for the Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield video games the Pokemon sword expansion and the Pokemon shield expansion pass will contain the island of armor and the crown tundra expansions two separate Avengers that will enable fans to meet new characters catch newly discovered Pokemon and explore new areas of the gala region available now exclusively on Nintendo's switch systems pokemon sword and pokemon shield are the fastest selling Nintendo switch titles of all time and the highest-grossing launch of any pokemon game with more than 6 million units sold worldwide during launch weekend we're gonna repeat that sentence real quick for our prosperity safe for all or maybe all the national Dexter's who might still listen to the show oh we're gonna talk about that event available now exclusively on the Nintendo switch systems pokemon sword and pokemon shield are the fastest selling Nintendo switch games of all time and it had the highest to believe bro sit well with all the shortcuts they took and the highest grossing launch of any Pokemon game and the lack of content with more than 6 million units sold during launch weekend so that's like a weird sentence it is a weird sentence the first no if it's written weird but you definitely read it weird so the first part baits that makes sense faster selling them Zelda Mario Mario Party what are there else breath of the wild breath of the wild but to be fair brothel wall came out the same day the Nintendo switch came out hmm - you would have had to buy a switch and it sells at the same time what about Katamari Damacy you know I think I think I think Pokemon has a slight edge without the hot that's not the hot seller you think it is well it is in my house in this house but we are a minority highest-grossing launch of any Pokemon game with more than 6 million units sold worldwide during launch weekend that is a weird sentence because they say the highest-grossing launch of any Pokemon game which would mean that the Pokemon game that made the most money and then they say 6 million units and then they say launch weekend so what's a what is a launch weekend to them is that Friday Saturday Sunday is that Saturday Sunday is that Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday it's probably like similar to movies which is Friday Saturday Sunday yeah I was gonna say that actually Thursday night Friday Saturday Thursday night midnight Friday Saturday Sunday remember when new music albums used to come out on Mondays at midnight I remember like lining up at the record store new release Tuesdays were a big deal of course you didn't matter that they came out at midnight because nothing was open well no there were some albums that came out where their store would open at midnight and you'd leave would line up and you're like oh I'm gonna get Radiohead's okay computer that was pretty rare oh it's no Harry Potter yeah maybe not rare here but in DC it was pretty popular you get this out of the way real quick during the Pokemon Direct presentation the Pokemon company international in Tendo also unveiled pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team DX this game revisits the classic pokemon mystery dungeon games poke my mystery dungeon rescue red rescue team and pokemon mystery dungeon blue rescue team which were originally released in the u.s. in 2006 now then tell us which systems and the updated visuals of a stunning picture book art style pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team DX launches on March 6 2020 I am actually excited for this because I had I remember the pokemon mystery dungeon the first ones came out they actually came out as both Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS titles if you recall that yeah I had one on a trip that I took to Dallas because 2006 was a really hard year for me and I just I remember I had the player guide and the game and I was super excited for it and eventually that petered out because I had too many other things to do with my life so I'm kind of like excited to look at the first pokemon mystery dungeon again on the switch and then see like maybe it's gonna reignite my spark for it there's more information about that bolo will will circle back to the mystery dungeon stuff here in a little bit so that was all that was in the announcement was they opened with the mystery dungeon stuff which I have thoughts on then they went into the expansion pass and then they said that Pokemon home will be coming in February but no details at the time which is both like exciting and worrisome they're like hey next month this huge thing that's supposed to appear on your switch and your phone's is supposed to come out and it's supposed to be better than bank but we have no details we're not gonna tell you anything about it at this point I'm suspecting that it's gonna come out on switch but not on the phones right away I bet that I bet that part's gonna be delayed I would agree with you and that's fine it's nothing in the world I just I just need a place to dump my Pokemon and swords or whatever it is as long as it lets me dump my Pokemon agreed all right the Pokemon sword and the Pokemon Shield expansion pack trainers will be able to jump right into the adventure with the same save data that they've been using to play pokemon sword in Pokemon shield they will also be able to begin exploring the island of armor in the crown Tundra at almost any point in the main games whether a trainer has recently started their journey in the gala region or as well along the path of becoming champion they will be able to enjoy the new content as soon as it's released and there's a little one here so bullet point number one footnote but no but no players will need to reach the wild area in Pokemon Sword and Pokemon shield in order to explore the island of armor or the crown Tundra this occurs about two hours of gameplay though individual gameplay may vary that's pretty fair I think yeah get to the wild area which is still before the first gym and you will be able to go to the other areas is this is where we like speculate of like what this like what happens exactly in this content if what's to speculate they told us everything you go to the fighting dojo you have your your rival you get to play with a slowpoke which let me say before anybody else gets to speak if you do not catch glare and slowpoke in a heel ball you've done it wrong glare and slowpoke is yellow and pink a heel ball is yellow and pink what if you're trying to get a shiny one then the heel ball doesn't match it anymore but look Chinese are wasted on me when do I get to express my disappointment about DLC soon we gotta get through the no you don't get to cuz I'm gonna not let you I'm gonna I'm gonna filibuster so there's when I when I stream on Twitch there there are I get I get the benefit of people being like I love the podcast and I can't believe will hasn't beat the game yet so I get a lot of that yes I get that on [ __ ] - y'all can stop okay you are my bad you want me to help you and I'm like I can't there's no helping will okay okay what do you want me to here here's the update for the week I was like let me make this interesting for myself so I was like you know I would really enjoy having an all Ghost type team so I put together this nice pretty well-balanced all Ghost type team I think it was like this is gonna be fun and I played for like 10 minutes and literally every Pokemon I was up against knew a dark-type move and used a dark-type move and wiped out my ghost type see why is Galler full of everybody playing Dark type moves and making this game miserable for me why couldn't I just have a pass on that 200 IQ we tell the gallery 5 5 5 d chests and I'm like I'm not here for it I look at look here's newsflash this game has converted me into a pokemon mystery dungeon player that's that bad like mom who just tried to play it mystery dungeon we'll see how long that lasts see so so the the theory all weekend was will is gonna hate the DLC and Greg is gonna love the DLC but going back to you can go to the new DLC at any point in time how I guess are they gonna scale it if your level 15 and how are they gonna scale it if you're a level a hundred what granted you beat the game if there's like more story content I doubt the team to scale it at all they're gonna do it like the wild area where you go and it's just like well your level for Pokemon but you're running into this level 50 pangoro stuff makes sense but if there's like trainers you have to battle to you know if if for some reason this fighting dojo is let's assume that it's like a Jim Jim challenge what level is that Jim challenge gonna be at to get to the end of the fighting dojo - I assume the fighting fighting dojo is good to do something III don't assume that that's just gonna be a gym challenge and then you're done and then you never go back to it again I'm assuming it's probably a mechanic that the I don't know like it changes Rotom or Landorus or teaches your starters how to Dynomax or something it worries me that there's that there's not going to be a lot of story that they are just going to be expanded wild areas and maybe a little bit of hey this feature opens like the dojo is akin to the nursery or to the battle tower and there's not much more to it I'm worried I'm worried about that with this sort of you can go there at any time because if it's just a wild area huh no so so what I'm thinking is when they say you can go there at any time is that you can go and you can do the part that is the wild area part where it's like the free roaming camera and you like can go in any direction and visit an area but once you get to the actual dojo building and try to start doing tasks in the dojo a building that those will be gated and that you'll have to be at certain levels in order to do those sections and it's like you can come here doesn't mean you're gonna be able to do anything Tom that's probably realistic and I I guess yeah Greg makes a good point where it could be like the battle power is that we said we're yeah they could just be like alright this might be of a series of challenges but we're gonna scale you to 50 yeah which i think maybe is like the best way to do it when I think of battle dojo I think of like oh it's probably a lot of battles see this just sort of tackles on my nervousness about paying $30 for another battle tower in a new wild area I paid $30 for more wild area I don't know if I would pay $30 for an extra battle tower so I haven't even gone through battle tower in the first game yeah I'm just okay I'm concerned I have strong concerns all right let's break this down even more the island of armor is scheduled to release at the end of June 2020 the crown tundra in the fall of 2020 assume probably November probably know that man yes the Pope so does anybody else find the sort of Japanese Chinese style that they have for the clothing and for the main character a vial of armor a little they have a large immigrant community from East Asia that only live on this island have you met Laura immigrant communities yes it makes a little bit more sense when we get to the legendary Pokemon I think we'll circle back to the I mean I know what you're talking about and I don't agree but yeah all right good I'm glad that you're the bank's redemption the tables have turned I mean there is one very simple reason why I am all in on this content and if people didn't recognize that just from the video then you guys don't know me at all okay the pokemon sword expansion pass in the pokemon shield expansion pack will include both sets of content this is also very confusing and I had to explain this like a million times this weekend which will be available for pre-purchase for a suggested retail price of $29.99 starting later today January 9th both expansions will include new areas to explore new discoverable Pokemon clothing items handy features and more in addition fans can receive a special bonus while purchasing the expansion pass a Pikachu uniform and a Eevee uniform fans will be able to receive the Pikachu and Evie uniforms in pokemon sword and shield by using the codes they were receive after they purchased the expansion pass I just want to get the price thing out of the way this is very confusing I'll make this as simple as I think I can if you own one copy of the game let's just say you went out and you bought pokemon sword because you liked wolf having a sword in its mouth you're a huge Dark Souls fan you only at most have to spend $29 30 bucks you will get both Tundra and the other armor for 30 bucks gets you both well plus tag if you like it's pretty 99 plus it's like 33 bucks if you own both copies of sword and shield because you wanted to give Game Freak 120 dollars instead of $60 then you have to give them another $60 if you want buddy another 30 oh you oh okay I know what you're saying yeah okay yes if you want both for both games now I don't know if they're gonna you know if you're gonna be able to walk in the target they're gonna have a little DLC thing on the shelf and that will probably not work and be compatible I don't know if they're growing that route we also don't know it for like Christmas they're going to sell maybe like an Ultimate Edition or an actual physical copy of these games that already have both on the Shelf ideally there's still an importance to having your game on on retail shelves well also when you go to the the menu screen in-game like to the save menu there is now a link that says click here to get the expansion pack it's like no thought required I think at least from where I'm coming from I don't actually know if it's worth it to buy it on both games because most and everyone's different but most people who buy both games they do it because they want to like trade with themselves and they want to catch you know both subs like a lot of people aren't giving away there's a she and rosamma Zenta so if you buy both games you'll be able to get both transfer them to one and most people have like a main game like my main game is shield mine too but I have gone my hat I have gone through sword because you know like I said no one's gonna trade me there's a she and no one gonna trade me their titanal they probably evolved it to Saval I but like if I bought the DLC on shield and I go through it unless I want to like experience that like DLC specifically again but at that point we don't even know how much story there is so is it worth it to buy it on the game I barely play to go through a wild area when I can get all the benefits of a wild area and the other one so I don't know if you really need to buy both have you owned both games I mean there's a couple of things that I I mean I bought both we do know that there's probably going to be exclusive between both definitely and I think the I love armor legendary that has two forms might be exclusive to each there's that so I have purchased both I mean I as as much as I'm skeptical about this whole thing I have paid them by 62 others because of the potential for exclusive exclusivity yeah okay so the difference here between the two and the island of armor in this expansion trainers will head to the island of armor the stage of a new adventure in the gala region the island of armor is a giant island full of environments not seen in gala before the players will find wave swept beaches forced bogs caves and sand dunes there are also plenty of Pokemon that will make the island their home living freely amid the lush natural surroundings there's even a dojo there that will specialize in some very particular training styles trainers and their pokémon will take up apprenticeship under the master of this dojo to train hard and become stronger the crown Tundra view on the other hand are we are we not going to talk about the other new Pokemon in the isle of armor I try to go I'm trying to go an order here what or dive the order the press release press release to her I don't have it send it to me this expansion is set in the snow swept realm of the crown tundra of the crown tundra features a beautiful shining silvery landscape in this frigid area with the jagged wintered mountains people live in small communities where they rely on each other SOS confirmed that's not true a certain Pokemon will appear a certain Pokemon will appoint the player as the leader of the exploration team in the crown Tundra where trainers will be tasked with investigating the reaches of this frozen land your trainers will be able to explore the full depth of Pokemon dens which they have only been able to see a glimpse of in machs raid battles so you're going underground it's fascinating so you get to go and actually explore the full Den like instead of just popping in fighting the thing at the opening and then leaving like you get to move around in these things you're gonna find out where they're hoarding all those TRS berries yeah but what's like a full debt as a full den like I went through the ultra wormhole I made it to sell Astellas land and I like did the most simplest puzzle ever to that encounter it's probably newly discovered Pokemon let's start off with cub foo which is the Wu the wushu Pokemon it the fighting type two feet tall American feet of course 26.5 American pounds so probably a little bit heavier than your cat a little bit the ability inner focus cub who will appear in the island of armor this Pokemon is hardworking and strives to Train both its body and its mind it uses each to defeat as motivation training itself with even more vigor after a loss in order to grow stronger it has an organ that produces fighting energy in its lower abdomen and before heading into battle cub who will release energy through unique breathing techniques and intense focus wild cub foo live in the mountains mountainous areas far away from the gala region but it was once a species that called Galler its home it's noted in historical texts that this Pokemon species used to head to uncharted lands with people as they set out to trade or explore records suggest that cub few living in faraway mountains today have descended from cub foo cub foo Cub Foods that became naturalized to the distant lands in visited journeys kept food the Conqueror Pokemon no the new Pokemon oh sorry I liked it better the first time they did it and it was called Pancham thank you Pancham was robbed Pancham has been robbed that's all I had to say no I kind of like how some Pokemon are very similar to each other like Dione say and the thing that no one cares about oh you mean the mechanical Pokemon the gem crib the thing that Sableye eat they love the worst host ever what is the colonists like Rock fear yeah carving wait dance is a carbon it's a special carving yeah but they're not like carving doesn't evolve into the an se but now but still still in the Lord ANSI is a special carving it's not just like where they like copied and pasted pancham and then just took the lead out of its mouth and said okay you're the QT fighting pokémon now Pancham you're yesterday's hot trash I think they maybe allude to it being a sudden transformation of a carbon alright never mind the pokedex entry says look anderson does been doing pokemon of the week for a fair number of years to have picked up on that little nugget of knowledge right there there there is like loves whiskey and a Lowell Imola yes which should have been connected there's miltank and tauros should have been connected and bouffalant it's somewhere out there so we're out there in do as your resident zoologist for the next 45 seconds like elegant ways and crocodiles they're kind of similar but actually pronounced to zoologist you know frogs and toads hey ya know I like the design I still think I still think that the that clear Japanese influence just is a little weird out like I want to use influence that could be I mean I don't know exactly with a headband style comes from wu-tang clang that's why it's the wushu Pokemon does that make sense well what fighting what fighting styles wushu like Oh whooshes Chinese okay yeah yeah that sounds right i all right I'm looking at blue shoe okay sport will you or Chinese kung-fu yes it's a wushu is the where they smoke it and it's like shredded cabbage and young it with the little pancakes no Maya wushu pork you know you can't have that as a soy don't you tell me what I can I have I mean I'm not telling you your body is telling you I can't even tell you a lot about American history the only thing I learned in grade school elementary school and the high school is there was a Civil War and Abraham Lincoln and slavery that's pretty much all they reiterate at least in MPs what about George Washington I don't think we learned anything about George Washington Thomas Jefferson I want I don't think so either I'm being I listen to the Hamilton soundtrack I know this to be true I know who you are married to you have been forced to listen to the Hamilton sound that's true I didn't learn that in MPs I'm just saying MPs just reiterates this award over and over again Milwaukee Public Schools I feel like there's like a small amount of history with Europe and China I mean right there is I mean so like it's playing a little bit off of the whole Marco Polo idea like they went out with traitors and then they all left completely and just stayed there like okay like there are no there no of the original left like everybody took them and we're like well we're going take yeah I'm confused on the direction of this are they saying that the what was his name come poo poo pretty good then it came from it's yeah it's like half Cubs you half Pancham whatever that it came from gallery and went to Asia or you came from Asia to Galler now it's come back from Asia to gallery it started and they all left apparently or I'd never them left that the species died out dark and yeah now they're back now that opened up this dojo on the Isle well it's just what is it called when all the continents are crammed up next to each other guy yeah Pangaea yeah that's a they left with people on trade there were vast traders on Pangaea you don't know you weren't there I was there I'm immortal it's disturbing pinchy I have a Civil War and was Abraham Lincoln involved well Abraham dinosaur Lincoln Oh cousin Paul okay so I I saw some people being very I saw a couple negative some negative comments about this because prior to these games coming out they said they really thought about the Pokemon that would live in the gala region and then some people complain that yes Europe or Great Britain is full of cactuses and elephants obviously that's not true obviously every Pokemon that is in Galler I mean isn't specifically I can feel it with the cactus but if you're gonna try to make a case that elephants with England's relationship mostly negative relationship with India doesn't mean that they would not have elephants that's like that's like glossing over that yes sir absolutely the name of the Pokemon is like almost derived from the in term yeah the elephant belongs there whether you like it or not you what whether you want to like talk about the dark history with India and the expansion of the British Empire like hmm I can see about the cactus but not about the elephant lack of Lily pup and Stalin and stuff were was also complained but if they really wanted to just be like British animals it would be like six ugly birds and a badger and and a grand bowl sure and II am Park has car keys I can get behind the the Chinese may be generalized Asian theme of cup foo in a British game because as somebody is gonna be lost on some people as somebody who watches watches a lot of Japanese wrestling they love to go out of their way to say that this Japanese megastar wrestler couldn't make it in Japan so they went to Mexico it's always Mexico always they'll be like because Mexico has a big history of luchador fight right so the long they'll always say like this wrestler who is now a megastar in Japan this Japanese wrestler who's a megastar in Japan didn't become a megastar until they realized that they couldn't make it they went to Mexico for four years they the Lucha Libre style they became this huge star in Mexico they came back and that's what made them a huge star in Japan this is always the story of Japanese wrestling I can definitely suspend my disbelief of this Pokemon started in Europe it couldn't make it it went to an Asian country it became it learned it learned the way of wushu and then it came back like that makes sense to me that glass over the problematic of couldn't make it and went to the mystical East to learn fighting like we're we're just gonna drop that whole line right now and same problem but fine they did it isn't that the story of the iron fist yes aren't there a lot of movies though that have this like trope oh yes okay that's why it's problematic why it's problematic I mean isn't really a trope of Japanese wrestlers are legit going to Mexico and then learning and then coming back yes because they're not legit going to Mexico are yeah no no they there they are I mean it is still a trope I mean it's a reverse trope but it's still a trope this is a legendary Pokemon for Oprah not it involves it involves to a Shifu which has two different warps which one will be sword when will be shield pick which is which right now which do you think is which I don't single strike and rapid strike one is fighting dark one is fighting water I'm gonna say the water one is shield I agree do we have any other water fighting fighting water program Poli Wow oh yeah the original Poli slap what what is it Poli work it's probably rally wrath Poliwrath is keldeo yah water fighting yeah Kelly is water fighting - this is fighting water it's different because the Fighting's first the water second yeah Calvillo Poliwrath and her Shifu are the only three that would be water fighting that's fine I was just curious both six three both two and and 31 pounds with the ability unseen fist which is a new ability that they don't describe they don't cup foo will evolve into your Shifu after it is undergone significant training it seems that oh she foo has two forms a single strike and rapid strike it appears that each form has different types as well her she few her Shifu in a single strike form style battles without holding anything back when enraged it will Mercy Mercy Li attack its opponents until utter defeat the single strike style Oh Shi Fu's movements are also direct and involved rushing forward in a straight line it will keep its distance from opponents at first and only leap in close instantly to deliver a powerful blow her Shifu in rapid strike style maintains a calm demeanor observing their opponents and measuring their strength while dodging attacks a rapid style her Shifu will use the flowing movements to battle smoothly to parry and opponents movements and then overwhelm the opponent with a furry fear of flurry or furry of rapid stress-free flurry of blizzards so we've had a couple Pokemon legendary pokémon evolve before specifically cosmogony to Cosmo um yeah into yeah yeah it's the new thing it's the new craze of the twenty teens I mean I say I like the design better than I like Cub whose design uh yeah I'm not super in love with them yet but I just if you know if they have that included Pancham in pangoro in these games if they had you excluded and then this was like a way of reintroducing them and some sort of more meta applicable manner I would have been like okay it's like Pancham is right there he's like on the outside of the window looking in and he's like I'm so sad I like a fighting dojo - yeah but what if what if wouldn't you would you go there they're like wrestling each other Pancham maybe I don't want to Mexico then can I say I would love to learn from you pinch and I don't want to learn from Mooseport sure what we're getting by them fighting each other when you arrive at the dojo other than it's good perfect I could just see them living together just the one happens to be legendary and one happening one travel to China Gregg and one came from there once an endangered species it will truly be legendary quite soon yeah they're fine I guess I don't know I'm not I'm not in love with these two pokémon there yeah I mean I'm sure I'll change my mind when I see them in motion and I have with most things well we also have to see what hidden piss does unseen fist because that could be a game changer so Giganta max single strike and rapid strike still the wushu Pokemon still fighting dark fighting waters still unseen fist single strike style / Shifu and rapid strike style your Shifu also have Giganta max forms Giganta max single strike style eat cheese come on Pokemon and this is a lot to say gigantic single strike style your Shifu looks like it's ready to bellow in fury people call it both the very embodiment of rage and a divine emissary that banishes evil spirits with fury Giganta max rapid strike style guru Shifu will quietly maintain its stance with a calm expression when facing this Pokemon it seems some will be greatly agitated feeling as very depths of their souls have been exposed yet others report feeling a sense of relief as if they've been cleansed of an evil spirit why is rapid strike style Giganta max or Shifu shorter then single strike file when they are the same size and I don't know it's its rapid strike style is at least in the image I'm looking at its higher because it's standing straight up on one leg with the other leg raised don't look at their heights look at their hands are different yeah the official height yeah yeah why is 110 feet different single strike is 90 to 95 feet and rapid strike is 85 feet and they both start at 6 3 yes why is me hmm you're 6 3 or 2 oh yeah I mean I know you're tall I just didn't know that you're for some reason I thought you're 61 hmm not quite look my entire height thing was destroyed by Brent long ago so I just yeah I just felt that weird like why why do they change height maybe the numbers mean something 1985 for single strike is also like the Giganta max forms is super red and then the rapid strike is super blue yeah yeah unless they do like black and white to show you where they they switch them right that was wonder that was the thing in black my - they switch the legendary pepra legendre's yeah what is the Japanese words four nine five two and eight five four I don't know hmm Andrew because it could be like the numbers on your Jersey Oh like a pause not a word yeah all right we got some new Pokemon and we got some more details kind of breaking down the differences between these two expansions but we're gonna take a break when we come back we'll do we'll go over these new Pokemon and we'll go over the rest of this DLC so we will be right back you're gonna think outside of the box yeah and outside of the bun [Music] I mean that's a pretty good saying yeah [Music] all right we got two new Pokemon starting with the legendary Pokemon kale Rex Cal Rex they say to the direct but now I can't remember how they said it I'll say kale Rex for now I'm probably wrong it is the king Pokemon it is psychic grass it is three feet seven inches a weight of 17 pounds as the ability unnerve trainers will encounter kale Rex in the crown of tunt the crown Tundra this Pokemon ruled all of Galler in ancient times though its appearance though it appears delicate and slight it's every move is filled with grace and dignity it also has an extremely high intelligence and it is said to see every past present and future event we've got what 17 different Pokemon types and we had to get another Celebi yeah you're out of ideas what possible site like the type makes sense for it but it didn't have to be grass what what do you see it's based off a flower okay well then let's base it off something else back to the very starting drawing board and say all right we've already done grass psychic let's do something different all right and then now what was it gonna look like and how can you not have like the big brain Pokemon that'd be psychic no psychic is fine that I'm fine with but why could it have been hey very psychic I don't know I Sai kit sure with everything I don't think it's like it's not been with every I mean you have psychics deals bronzong you have psychic fire delphox psychic dark malamar normal psychic or Ranga ruh bug psychic is gonna be the orbital ice psychic mr. rime but I'm talking about mythical biting psychic medicham I mean I'm fine with every mythical being a psychic but just like why did we have to get another Celebi yeah there are a lot of psychic mythical there Hoopa dark psychic like their psychic types and dragon types real dragon psychic that could have been great or psychic dragon I don't care one way or the other I mean like the is there a psychic dragon alternate cause ma lot T a lot to you oh yeah yeah I think the typing is fine I mean it's not like you can use mythical Pokemon in battles it's not like anyone's ever used their Celebi besides Jo it's his mascot there was my like the design kind of it's a little weird yeah I want to see it move it's a lot it just floats yeah like a like a dandelion on the weather it's weird deer rabbit head there was debate with this Pokemon of whether it was a deer or a rabbit I guess we end the debate here so it's a rabbit why do you say it's a rabbit the will sigh I mean I can definitely see it as a rabbit when you look at the drawing of it because it's not antlers it's just it has four ears Rex is a breed of rabbit it's also Latin for king yeah it's Latin for care and the there is a type of rabbit that is the the Rex there's a species of rabbit yes okay Cale it's kale --ax that part of its name comes from botany which is the outermost group of floral parts or like this it's Latin for bud so it is a king rabbit with the bud being its crown I wonder if it'll blossom I'm sure we'll have a form where it's bud brain opens up or something I don't understand like in the drawing what it's pointing at it so you over there over there it's a welcoming point come welcome to my home so this is like the third right the this is the kirim of the set this is the well not every Pokemon game had like three versions like ho and Lou gear just so low but you would assume that because this was the king joshey on and zama Zenta are the sword in the shield for the king right sure I mean you don't do but sure I mean why is it in a different area in that in I was in the crown Tundra yeah the crown it's the king I mean they don't really answer in the story why they covered up the fact that I mean I think wills gotten that far you gotten to the part where the copper Raja destroys that wall yeah spoiler they don't really answer why the entire game you're like why was this covered up yeah why was that sculpture hidden away and then Griffith and over in the in the Badu in where Sonya was like why is there only one hero when these scriptures here show that there are two heroes oh the mysteries that we still need to unraveled I mean I don't know that that's I mean it's it's like lost in time sort of a thing so I don't know that there's much more to it than people started believing it one way and then it made sense to have a hero it's just I don't know that there's much more than people thought it was one it's actually two you know yeah things get lost and uncovered all the time I mean I think what's more interesting is that we should talk about the fact that the darkest day happened at the same time kalos fired off the big weapon I mean they do say the darkness day is three thousand years ago and yep these thing was three thousand years there's three thousand years ago oh well there you go someday they're going to come out with one of those books like they did for Zelda that's like that lawyers all the entire history of the Pokemon world all these pieces are gonna fit together that's all the book does not put any pieces it's like real there's like a lot of stretches and our next new podcast Punk upon timeline will discuss how the multiple universes fit together I actually do like this Pokemon though I think it's cool looking I like I like the design at first I thought are we just not seeing all of it but then I realized when I finally saw pictures of it like oh no it is just it is upright with a little cape and a giant yeah a big big head little body big head of a body most psychics the standard trope of big head little body yeah I watch it to Keira I know how it goes regional forms of familiar Pokemon regional forms of certain Pokemon are found in Galler these forms have a Apted to the unique environment of the gala region and look different than the same species might look when found in other regions these adapted forms are known as gala forms of these pokemon and seemed to have behavior seem to have their be it behavior also differ from species previously discovered and then they show us glare and slowpoke which you can get as of this recording is the dopey pokemon it is 311 height 79 pounds the ability gluttony and own tempo its psychic the slowpoke of the gala region used to eat the seeds of certain plants that grew in their habitat these seeds were in fact Galeras chia seeds used to this day asthma spent essential spice for cooking in the gala region the slowpoke and gal are built up articles of the spice in their bodies over several generations even gaining the unique appearance and behavior they are known for today Valerians slowpokes spend their days wallowing on the seashore and in river bakes without thinking of anything in particular occasionally they might get a very sharp look in their eyes but they will soon revert to their zoned out expression it is thought that the behavior is caused by the accumulation of Galatia particles stimulating gallery' and slow pokes brain resulting in it thinking of something tremendous only for gallery' and slowpoke to immediately forget of what they thought hilarious can we just talk about how this is longer than every description of the very popular so that's very a lot of time on it yes gallery' and slowpoke can also evolve into gallery' and Slowbro if a specific item can be found in the island of armor if evolved into the Silurian slowking instead if a specific item can be found in the crown tundra base original slowpoke is it psychic or is it water psychic water no psychic water Oh cuz this is just psychic and I have to look it is water psychic and glaring a slowpoke is pure psychic it's just psychic regular slowpokes ability is oblivious or own tempo and goal Aryan slowpokes ability is gluttony or own tempo yeah canto slowpokes hidden ability is regenerator I guess we technically don't know if that would be the same it could be it could not be they've done yes the first thing so and we we do know that we don't know what valerian Slowbro Orgel area and Slowking look like they show kind of some of it in the trailer so Kings got a lot of eyes yeah we don't know what it's we don't know what its stats are we don't know its ability we don't know if like slow King becomes like a super fast Pokemon instead of a super slow like we do we just don't know there there are stat differences between like executor and a lowland executor hand Raichu and Rollo and write you and stuff so but that was that was cute it was so the game did get updated from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1 point 0 it did fix a there are no patch notes of course because it's a Nintendo game so we don't know exactly what was fixed I think people have already tested and there was a issue with sucker-punch in competitive we do know that that was fixed the all raid resetting moving the clock forward that was not fixed still to the state don't know if that could ever be fixed yeah with the updates of one point one point zero if you go to wet church and you have at least gotten to the wild area you will meet one of the new characters for a hot second and you will also be able to catch Glary and slowpoke you're curious and shiny hunting it you cannot get a shiny in the actual encounter but you can Masuda breed or just breed for a shiny did you ever get yours no I'm at like 600 oh there was a quick theory that maybe it was like boosted odds like the Magikarp event but I think when I think like it actually gave like a cool moment in in like the Pokemon community if you're active on I'm like dis cords or slacks or twitches twitch or whatever where everyone was hunting the same Pokemon so that was kind of cool it almost felt like a mini community day where everyone was breeding slowpoke together I don't think it's boosted at all I just think a couple people got very early and lucky and then said they got it very early and lucky but also everyone's hunting it at the same time so then people are like yeah well maybe I'll get it early and lucky it's not how odds work is this where we talk about the gigantic Mex designs yeah we can well yeah let's talk about the specifically the starters at least so we have Giganta max Rilla boom Jake hey it's max andreas Giganta max in Italian Rilla boom is the drummer Pokemon guerrilla booms tree stump drum has grown rapidly to the point that it now resembles a small forest on its own Giganta max marilla boom has merged with the forest of the drums to become even more powerful he can control it sticks as it was its own limbs and will demonstrate transcend transcendental transcendental drumming techniques Giganta max Rilla boom will completely focused on playing its drums compelled by the power of welling up inside the sound can reach across oceans and by and heard by those living in other regions it said that those who hear the beat will begin to dance uncontrollably overwhelmed by the rhythm that surges from inside them what a fitting tribute to Neil Peart yeah I mean I like this one although I think the like that I can't quite tell if it's it's hair growing out to hold drumsticks is that what everybody is that like oh wait everyone everybody sings honestly I didn't I guess I skipped over this the island of armor expansion will allow trainers to helps some of Pokemon traveling with them gain the ability to Giganta max well there you go question answered this has led to the discovery of Giganta max forms Rilla boom cinder ace and antalya and the evolutions of these three pokémon that trainers could choose as their first starter pokemon in the gallery agent I feel like that definitely hit there's the question yeah that'd probably ask you the question yes all right cinder ace the burning ball at cinder aces feed has grown to massive proportions things to Giganta max energy if Giganta max and race kicks the ball using its well honed techniques the fighting spirit will possess the ball and call the ball to pursue opponents as it has a mind of its own giganto max and rays most incredible leg strength in fact its legs are said to rank among the strongest of all Pokemon even without its even without its gigantic pyro ball it can deliver powerful kicks kicking moves that overwhelm other Dynomax Pokemon so cinder ace is now on a final fantasy bomb find the fantasy Pokemon crossover confirmed prior fighting game firmed 2021 when Pokemon shows up in the final fantasy MMO it looks like a bomb it just look like yeah it does look like the bomb from Final Fantasy like a lot and finally in telly on and tele it has gained an extremely long tail thanks to Giganta maxing its tail length is said to be over a hundred and thirty feet while Giganta max intelli on will stretch out its long tail and hold it straight to form a pillar and intelli on will take battle on top of that position we'll take a battle position at the top this Pokemon has an incredibly sharp mind and calculated with the precise effects that gravity will have on the trajectory of its shots enabling it to be an extremely effective sniper Italian has hidden tools within its body and they have these and these have been enhanced due to Giganta max dictating membranes on a sure she's they're big words jeez this is a game for ten years old Pokemon that's like kids biology nictitating dictating what the okay break it down what does that mean give me the science Greg no it's actually spelled nictitating yeah it's belt weird but that's how you spell like it not the blink yeah so the NIC tating membrane like dogs have it and most lizards have it is that is the third eyelid that's translucent so they blink while keeping their eyes open sorry oka so it's a nictitating membrane is see-through remembering that's like an eyelid how they can remote in their eyes while still maintaining vision it's seen a lot in fish reptiles birds humans and primates don't have it camels polar bear seals a lot of things have a nictitating membrane is basically for Austin's purposes most people just call it the third eyelid hmm we're used to them when they close their eyes but the nictitating membrane allows them to continue seeing while moistening their eyeballs while this now lets in telling detect temperature air pressure and humidity and tally Anna's a skilled sniper as well easily hitting a berry that is rollin over rollin around over nine miles away I thought the rifle was a good idea yeah I didn't want to say it but if we were thinking of these as like highschool clique troops it has suddenly become bad I I have I am uncomfortable with the rifle I know is it more like a spear gun than a rifle okay no it's it's a sniper right in it so there's no such thing like people have been trying to watch it's a water harpoon there's no water harpoon perch water harpoons are used in the water not from a sniper's perch you also don't say Oh remember James Bond and his water harpoon I mean it's a secret agent Pokemon it's a sniper rifle it they keep talking about him being a sniper yeah I mean they're never going to say rifle and they're never going to say it God and they will probably stay say sniper it's a little uncomfortable I think the optics are real bad on check antem accent le on yeah just really are the optics it just it looks like I didn't want to say school shooter but it looks like a school shooter like you have the jock whose cinder ace you have the musician that's what's his name monkey boo dude oh and then you have this the shooter people were pushing the school angle for this really hard yes we we were on a set on this podcast we talked about the school angle and like this this addition just makes it look bad the outlooks are that the objects are bad I'm I'm I like I mean I'm glad they're getting Giganta maxes but this one just really this one really makes me uneasy just it could look better in game somehow I don't know how but I I just wish they had gone a different route I can't say that I disagree in any way I this honestly just anything non gun based would have been much better and the other ones are so fantasy like like a giant drum set in a big soccer ball when you set up those two things of realism like it's a big drum kit and it works like a drum kit it's a real big soccer ball and it works like a soccer ball with an intelligence in it it's an ice gun okay so putting aside the whole school theme I am more surprised that they were willing to give a Pokemon something that looks like a gun because in space world demo for gold and silver remoraid and octillery looked more like a gun in a tank and they changed that so then they check they've had these conversations before clearly you can assume well I don't know we can talk about this forever I think you know two things are gonna happen either no one like this will this will be a non-issue the game will come out people have already made their jokes about Italian everyone moves on or when the DLC actually drops and if for whatever reason any parents want to latch on to this they will specifically latch on to each other so I can see like I can see it going two ways either no one's going to care when this comes out and for the most part this yeah I think I think overall it's it's as it's harmless like I think jinx is pretty harmless at this point even though it has bad history or some parent will hold on to this and they will use this as Pokemon is the devil and it's corrupting our children and looking to happen no matter what I mean it is I mean there's any people who are upset about it I ultimately is like I don't hate the design I think it's you know it fits well with the theme I just think if they wanted to avoid controversy at all they would have picked a different direction yeah like this is just courting controversy like whether you think it's harmless or not whether you think it's a water harpoon or not the fact that we have the conversation is a conversation that I don't think they necessarily want people having about their content and their design at minimum there will be 32 memes made about this certain of which will actually be funny yeah I mean like you're you started one so I already have my joke on Twitter that came from my husband and and and we like the three of us who are very deep into Pokemon lore week we can we can find pokedex entries that are very dark and very grim oh yes my parents aren't looking for that they're looking for a screenshot of look at this Pokemon with like right right well those are the three Giganta max yep a couple things here I'm going to read this next part and then uh well this is theirs mmm all right more past Pokemon available to obtain in pokemon sword and shield many pokemon that didn't appear in pokemon sword and shield make their homes on the island of armor or the crowned tundra trainers will meet lively array of diverse pokemon from newly discovered legendary pokemon and new regional forms too familiar pokemon that have been seen living in other regions free updates are planned for pokemon sword and shield to coincide with the release of these expansions updates are scheduled as the same day of the island are an armor and crown tundra expansions are released each update will enable players who have not purchased the expansion past to receive the pokemon via the island of armor and Crown tundra expansions through means such as trading players will also be able to bring over past Pokemon to games from the cloud service Pokemon home scheduled to release in February 2020 as long as those Pokemon appear in the island of armor and Crown tundra and just to get this out of the way new outfits fans will be able to obtain a special training uniform in the island of armor in the crown tundra trainers can Don exploration gear preparing themselves for researching and trading destinations the tundra holds they might find a strange temple where at least to expect it or a mysterious giant tree growing in a place that it doesn't belong new outfits seems that new hair is also being added it looks like you can have roses hair that is really exciting that was actually one of my complaints is while I do like the character customization in this game I felt like a lot of people were gravitating towards a set of clothes that looked really cool or the better hairstyles it seems that there are they're adding some new hair and some new clothes which is nice going back to new Pokemon I think they said a hundred new Pokemon for crown Tundra and then a hundred new Pokemon for armor so that's G hundred and fifty one hundred for sure nice hmm I hear some compliance Greg [Music] Gregg and I certainly don't look at this in the same way nope so my okay my problem with this yes it underline it undermines the arguments that they were making for limiting the decks in the first place the idea that they were carefully picking ones for that region and they were doing it for competitive reasons like if they were really doing it for competitive reasons there's not enough time to see what the current competition is like without adding in more like this is coming in six months and there's no way they've analyzed all that it I've figured out what the new meta is and then decided that these ones are gonna help balance that out so it undermines that it feels like a like they're capitulating to the national deck ters on some level like you know I don't agree to that at that point but go on like hey we are adding these back tada like they said they weren't and then here we are so there's no way to have done this whether they meant it or not without giving fuel to those arguments which average problem with me being the bitter person that I am I would have net like I would have never get I would released a third with no new Pokemon like maybe one we're pull some but I don't I don't know if you can do that check out it so I guess I hate you because you were all nasty low did you see that I got the party hat Wurmple and yet you guys do you know I have no that I certainly did I have not gotten it yet they didn't specifically say in the the direct that normally we do a third version and that this content replaces the third version so in the history of third versions every third version has always added more Pokemon than the game before true so I don't see it any different in that sense I see it the reason why I see it different is this is a different product so usually when there's a third version it's a year year and a half later they hundred sixty-four days if it's ultra Center mood they have changed up the story some they have added remove things and you're getting a full cut you're getting the game again with additions and as a person that likes a lot of the Third's who often thought a lot of the third versions were a lot better than the first version yeah we don't know what we're we don't know what we're getting that's true everybody's like oh the DLCs will be great and it'll be all this great content like we don't know that we don't know that we're getting more storyline we don't know we don't know what we're getting we don't know that these are going to bring actual value we knew they're gonna add them in adding them in this quickly just sort of undermines a lot of the message that they were giving going into and dealing with that massive ugly movement and I feel like it really gives a lot more power to their arguments which is really unfortunate and I I don't like it that way I also have I'm very concerned when any large triple-a company starts doing DLC because we already feel like games come out weighted quickly and if DLC is a very acceptable way it's a lot of games now put out games that are maybe 3/4 done and they're just gonna patch it in add that content in with the DLC because that's now expected and I don't think that that's a good step that any company has taken and I'm hoping this DLC will be very worth it that it will feel like you're getting a bunch of news story and a bunch new content and there's a lot to do and it doesn't feel like hey we added a new battle tower and we needed a way to shove in more Pokemon and here you go so we don't have a great history with dlc dlc often for a lot of game starts out really strong and then just gets worse and worse and worse because it's seen as a way to sell a half-baked game at full price that you'll patch later with dlc and i don't have any evidence that this will happen here but it has happened before so when a company makes the change to dlc i get concerned get concerned about what their future plans are I get concerned about their willingness because all corporations try to do things faster and a certain timeframe and if they can put out a smaller game every seven months and then bring out an expansion six months after that like it's a weird cycle to have started so this change away from getting a full baked third game to we're gonna start patching things in if you didn't like third version games great this is great for you but we don't I don't have proof that this is going to be worth that big of a change and there's a lot of troubling signs around DLCs all I want to say yes number one Volcarona is back so that shiny bug team I've been working on for the past two years is back complete again and number two I mean I don't see it as capitulation I'm sure that this DLC has been planned and in progress for a long long time and we're still not getting a full 800 I also disagree that they are they're not gonna you know be able to see the meta they can tweak the stats on different pokemons pretty close up to til the last minute you know if they just need to make something a little more powerful to help balance things out and everything like that I think they've got some leeway but we just using meta we just got Giganta max in the new BGC like we are still they're still working through what they did in the game proper and this comes out in June yeah okay so it's like the the VGC part they are only allowing a specific only Jarek Giganta max Pokemon that have been promoted or allowed yeah and we just got a new wave of promoted they and those promoted will probably be ready for season 3 which is really fast already so season 1 was no Giganta max season or season yeah season 1 was no Giganta max it ended December 31st season 2 started June 3rd and gigantic max Pokemon are allowed and I will tell you right now is somebody who did 80 plus battle in ranked in doubles in season 1 season 2 is very different I have done 20 battles right now and I have as somebody who went I think it was like I had like 43 wins and like 35 losses and I made its master ball pretty easily I can't win a single match with the same team I used in season one because that meted knew that meta shifted so fast and it's going to shift again one season three starts which will be February and then season four in March III think that's a good thing to have because in past Pokemon games it was always well this is Landorus this is Cresselia this is primal Groudon this is primal Kyogre and these have to be on your team and it doesn't seem with the exception of drag a pole it doesn't seem like there is one specific Pokemon so if their goal is to just keep changing it I think that's fine I think you're right of maybe like six months is not enough time to do that but I but it's we don't know we like we don't even know what the stats are for Slowking so if if they wanted to boost slow Kings stats like up ten because they see that there is a dominance in fast poison Pokemon and they think that slow King would be a good counter they can do that without us ever knowing that they change those stats before June comes I guess technically Slowking is hundred nuts Tedra yeah I mean they could it just it it seems to undermined that message a lot and I I don't know they've there are so many more people in competitive this time around and like they're really you're negative means more more that you have to look at like having more people run it just means there's a lot more data that you have to go through it doesn't cut the time down but that doesn't necessarily that doesn't necessarily mean that they have a team dedicated to that and that all they're doing is looking at that kind of stuff like I am assuming and Pokemon they haven't really no dedicated team to it then it takes even longer yeah but I'm assuming that the Pokemon they promoted this time around they promoted it with the reason to counter things in again this is all speculation but they promoted Lapras colossal apple and elk Remy and there was zero alchemy and there was zero flap 'el in season one and there are some Appleton and some elk Remy I am now seeing in season two and now that they've promoted those Pokemon the GMAX form of alchemy and the GMAX form of flap will / Appleton will be available probably in season 3 maybe that's a coincidence I don't know but it seems to be it seems to be lining up pretty like I feel like they've picked those promoted Pokemon because they saw what was perm they saw what was being used in season 1 and now they are preparing for season 3 hmm maybe I don't know but they did do what they said they were going to do which is focus on competitive and even the base changes of you can't flinch Giganta max pokemon we're adding room service for the amount of trick room teams we see they added you know wheezing which everyone thought was gonna be really good but no one's using right now to like disable abilities I still think that a hundred Pokemon is yes a hundred Pokemon in June and the number 100 Pokemon in November is definitely adding more complexity to that and then I mean and they're bringing back huge ones they're like ones that dominated before yeah yeah now the problem right now is they showed Landorus they showed blenders they showed that's the somatic gross they showed Garchomp but there but but and we're assuming that round Tundra brings back a bunch of the legendaries like we're assuming that they're bringing that like once Jun comes like those Pokemon probably won't be available for battle until August because they said end of June which means they probably aren't going to start that season there there's no way if if it comes out like June 20th and the games only out for 10 days I can't see them saying like these 100 pokemon are going to be available July 1st I think that's soonest they would be available August 1st so then at that point you have 10 months of this game existing in a meta before adding a hundred new Pokemon and I think that's pretty I think that's fair I think that's fine I don't know that it's fine like they I don't know that because they've taken out so many moves they restricted a lot of things I I don't know that this timeframe is enough to with all the changes with all of the GMAX with all the moves different with all the new abilities there are so many moving parts I don't know that ten months is enough I think ten months is more than enough if you look at competitive games like apex or fortnight where they're changing things if not once a month every two weeks yeah but they but those are like these are set once something's in this game like a bug was in this game they've not ever changed it the stats in the middle of the game that's programmed in is that it's in they call those up they they hmm right you can they can I don't know that they will I mean seven years ago Masuda said they were never gonna do dlc and that was something we've already always brought up on the podcast of like this is right like I guess I believe the dude who's in charge of Pokemon to say they're never gonna do DLC and now they've done DLC so I like with competitive games you have to this is just a general thought I feel like with all competitive games you have to make changes to keep competitive fresh and I don't think what was working before of not changing anything whether that's adding or removing Pokemon is is good enough to keep people's interests I mean if you look at the Pokemon Trading Card Game they change it every three months yeah but you also have to pay every three months yes as much of a cash grab trading card game is significantly more successful than the BGC you all true you always have more people playing the card game and they're changing that every three months and for whatever reason they have these two weird formats where Japan is playing at ahead of time then yeah it's just they can just straight up and Pokemon like if Drago pol is too powerful nothing is stopping them from banning it yeah have they done that before no but that doesn't mean they can't it's also like not a great experience and then one thing I do know about the competitive Pokemon company is I don't think any of them like Landers no but they're bringing it back yeah it's going to be an incredibly nerfed Landorus yeah I mean the staff could be different I mean we know again my issue is there's a lot that we just don't know and there's a lot of signs that worry me and everybody who's yelling at me on Twitter like this is the greatest thing since sliced bread great I'm glad that you're excited I will be excited once I'm there but there's enough here to cause me pause that said I bought it all like him I bought it I've already paid my money because I'm going to see if it's worth it and I'm hoping I don't get burned and I'm hoping it doesn't set up a bad precedent for the future like I'm banking on past history of a lot of companies not coming true here I will say I don't know if this is the best solution for gamefreak but I am very excited that they are trying it if they try it and fail at least we can say we tried it but you know to to like lie to ourselves of being like Lake dlc for pokemon games were rampant around gen 5 and Gen 6 and gen 7 every single time Pokemon fans were like this is going to be the game that gets DLC and those were never the games that got DLC like don't like the Pokemon community can't pretend to themselves that that like they didn't want DLC for the last 10 plus years yeah but what they think they're getting and what they actually get it could be vastly different things like oh this is always that's always the case with playing games it's one by one it's also the case with DLC like there's been a ton of DLC that is runed games like you may want it but are you sure like the history of DLC 8 ain't great so a couple things I want to go back to the adding the Pokemon they did say that the Pokemon you get in this game or the Pokemon you get in this game I don't think this is like some weird loophole that they did because to add more Pokemon because one I don't think you can add a new area of a Pokemon game with a slight new story without adding more Pokemon if this was here's a new area with the same MO Pokemon and we're going to add a battle dojo that would probably not appeal to me because there is a certain set of the Pokemon audience that want to catch and discover new Pokemon even if those are Pokemon they've already caught before that's why when people go through you know X&Y or Sun and Moon they will catch the Pokemon over again because they enjoy catching and discovering and finding Pokemon and then there's a certain set of people that don't want to do that and they will wait till Pokemon home comes out and they will drag and drop all their Pokemon over to can instantly complete their pokedex and they were fine but I don't think that they could have done this without adding new Pokemon now I don't think that this was a pivot to national Dexter's I think that this was always planned the let's go team finished their game over a year ago this game came out what is that team working on was that team working on this was it not I'm assuming it was like all hands on deck for sword and shield when sword when they did finish let's go there's like so many thoughts too because like I mean whether they meant it or not is still it still slightly comes across that way sure like but during that during that entire time during that entire time when they were getting those lead up when they kept saying what you get is what you get yeah gave no hint or anything like we are gonna add things later we're gonna expand this game if they were working on at that time there they could have stopped so much of that controversy by saying we do have plans to deal with this in the future but we're not gonna tell you what that is do you think the likes by announcing the problem is like announcing this and seeing the people that are excited the people that are excited are excited because they love sword and shield the people that were against this game the National deck sirs while they while they started off being upset because not all the Pokemon were there these were the same people that got mad when you climbed a ladder the Pokemon stopped moving these were the same people that got mad that they didn't believe that the title screen was good enough compared to last Pokemon games those people are out of their minds so to like say that swords and shields coming there's 400 Pokemon we might add Pokemon later that would have never satisfied them well we don't well so a lot of the hyper focus on all the details was to underline their starting disappointment so when you started with the disappointment that you didn't at all address you gave the doorway wide open for them to start nitpicking everything else to prove their point like it was a chain reaction it wasn't like hey this isn't up to snuff until they heard that there wasn't gonna be everything in there but that was a chain reaction to it such a small percentage of people like at the start of this podcast we talked about how this was the fastest selling Pokemon game of all time right so you have a very small local community complaining and nitpicking these games and while it does reach it doesn't reach the majority of people it doesn't reach you know mom walking into store to buy new Pokemon game for son for Christmas it does reach us who deal in the pokemon community every day reach that son whether they ask for it or not like that son might be connected to those games that person might be looking at to say hey is this what I want to ask for or I have $60 where I can buy one game is this it and then you've got a flood of people online who are very loud and talking down your game like it may not reach the person that bought it but it's gonna reach the person that's deciding whether or not they want to ask for it maybe the games prove that they sold incredibly well so like how much did without with all that noise they they sold incredibly well they did I'm just not thrilled about any anything that gives any credence to the noise like the problem and you could go back to like seven years ago where Masuda was was saying like there wasn't DLC and then people being like what Masuda lied seven years ago there is DLC now and it's he did lie I mean he was right hey baby when you say you're never gonna do something and then you do it like I believe you also said at one point that Pokemon would always be a 2-d game yes yes he did so but also not even it wasn't even it's not even been five years ago where almost every game was 60 bucks and now the most popular games in the world are free fortnight Pokemon go legal legends DotA like these are free games that make more money than $60 games so I sure at one point DLC was never planned for a Pokemon game but now it is I don't know if it's the best way I don't think that these updates though are like some pivots to satisfied national Dexter's I think that in history when they added pokemon crystal they added more Pokemon when they did emerald they added more Pokemon when they did platinum they added more Pokemon when they did Sun and Moon it was 302 Pokemon ultra Sun altra Moon was 400 Pokemon this is 400 Pokemon I think adding 100 Pokemon which in reality is not that many Pokemon because six six of those Pokemon are the new Duran family and Nolan's melon melon juicer and no one's using that arena or NIT arena so I guess out of that out of those six you're using two Nidoqueen tomato King so like a hundred Pokemon is is not a lot I don't think this also leads to them adding the rest of the Pokemon because I do still think that initial thing of we're not adding all the Pokemon what you get is what you get I still think that stands by it I don't think exploring like a new Beach region and not seeing new Pokemon would be particularly interesting but because there is now a beach there are Pokemon like slow poke maybe Psyduck that would probably exist on this beach in the winter area there will probably be pokémon like Metagross who is normally in the icy area of game or at least Metagross was in the icy area of black-and-white - that will probably exist these Pokemon aren't behind the paywall which was which is nice which was like some weird narrative that people started stirring up of like oh you have to pay $30 you get these 200 Pokemon no that's not true you just have to update your game once you update the game you can either transfer those Pokemon from black and white to or X&Y through Pokemon home into these games or you can trade if you don't want to pay for Pokemon home if assuming that that cost money you can trade with somebody who did catch a slowpoke or a Psyduck and trade it to you but I I think that this is I think I think I buy inherent I definitely 100% want this over a third version and I'm as I told you before I was like I'm hoping that they do it like they do with destiny where it's like a main game and then two subsequent DLCs and then another main game and they alternate that way and I think that's a really nice way to kind of keep interest in the game and keep it progressing and then you just like have a big bump and then here's new things to keep you interested as you go and then you're a big bump and you keep going like that I'm actually very curious because if you look at like the sales of Sun and Moon specifically that game sold like 16 million copies and then if you look at Ultra Sun ultramoon that game sold 8 million copies that's a lot of copies even the 8 million there's a lot of video games that you know struggle to even sell a million or two million so a million copies automatically awesome if you go back to Sun and Moon and if you say like man I wish I wish this game was better polished I wish they would have taken a year extra on Sun and Moon do I think an extra year of waiting makes that 16 million copies go up further I don't think so I think that you put out a game you sell 16 million you put out an enhanced version of that game and you sell another 8 million that's pretty good that's a lot of money to boat out a rehash version of your new game I also think though that that becomes a that becomes like some weird issue where I would never recommend Sun and Moon to anyone because Ultra Sun and ultra moon or platinum or emerald are significantly better games once you put enough time into those games it's very hard to go back like for me it's very hard to go back to Sun and Moon because I already caught all the pokemon and also senator ultra moon I already went out of my way to get all the TMS I already bought all the clothes I have 999 leper berries I have all these Rotom boosts and Sun and Moon offers none of that and I think there's probably a some part of the audience that would expect that expects a third version so it's like why would I why would I buy diamond pearl platinum will be the better version I'll wait for that it will have more Pokemon it will have more features it will fix issues the same with Ultra Sun all Tremayne why would I buy Sun and Moon when this is the better version and I do think that's why those games sell good well and and obviously Pokemon fans they want just more Pokemon so they'll buy it anyways but in this sense I feel really good and really comfortable investing even more time into these games because I don't have that feeling of starting over I have shook these berry trees and I hate the berry trees and sword and shield I think they're awful it is not a fun mechanic to like shade and wait and see no but I have shook them every day to get my berries because I don't know when I'm gonna need like 25 berries in order to reduce my happiness to fix my emails my berries but it puts this confidence in me that the things I am doing everyday like V I'll cram me sweets the berries collecting the watts having the money that I don't lose all of that by starting over again and I can comfortably continue playing these games and get more content and that that is a good feeling I don't mind starting over that has never bothered me like when Sun and Moon came out I was excited to catch all the Pokemon when X&Y came out I was excited to catch all the Pokemon even though I have those Pokemon there is there is a point we're starting over feels great I don't him starting over once a year particularly feels great especially in the past where the story's like slightly different and yeah it was cool that like whoo they added like Magnemite and stuff I think Magnemite was an ultra not in regular but if you don't add the new Pokemon no I agree they do just get like rainbow rocket and it was like well that was like two hours and that was cool but enough rainbow rocket was worth 40 bucks I mean we don't know that there's any worse 30 bikes I will say as a third version player usually when the third version came out I would want to play the game again and since I don't like deleting my old games I you know I want to keep what I caught there and be able to pass things through and I can pass items that I already got to make that play through easier and it can play it the way that I want I always enjoyed the third version when it came out because I usually wanting to play the game over again and I could customize it the way that I wanted from the beginning so not having that anymore is a disappointment to me because I don't get to have that experience of a third version that incorporates everything that's changed the story along the way that we've had in the past so I am mournful that that is gone I understand that I am very much in the minority of that but I did really always like the third version so I will miss that I also think the high praises that everybody's singing for something that's not out yet is it necessarily warranted well it's okay to be excited it's gonna be exciting out but like people are like absolutely bonkers about how this is going to be completely worth the money and it's absolutely everything that they wanted I'm like it's not even out yet how do you see my ID this is why I wanna do that this is I just live in my own little bubble I think it's super exciting I think why that excitement has blown up is because what they showed actually looked great the all the concept art looked gorgeous like the beach art like ministry the like building with the tree coming out of it in the mountainside looks great I think it was that st. so before the whole national dex news broke I think everyone was excited for sword and shield because of how it looked visually and for the most part if you put the national dex stuff aside and the pokemon not moving when you're on a ladder for the four ladders in that game there's a lot of n ladders in the area 8 X 4 here up and down those letters a whole lot about 80 chutes and ladders III think that Galler is one of the most beautiful regions they've ever made yes so III do think that I think it's very easy to be excited for this the question is is it is it worth 30 dollars yeah and that that will never be answered because some people like if you if you look at like a game gone look if you look at a game such as fire watch or gone home those games were twenty dollar games that are two hours long and a lot of people don't think that that's worth it whereas like a game such as destiny maybe that's a bad example but you could put a hundred hours into destiny for 60 bucks why cos Destiny's a free to play game or you could pay 60 bucks for overwatch and play for five minutes and realize you hate it so like that that argument of is the $30 worth it that's gonna be different for like every person yeah I mean but no I mean there are gonna be some like if it's just another wild area that really has nothing to the game I think a majority of people be like this definitely wasn't worth the price like there's definitely if it doesn't deliver enough on the promise that it's showing here then people are gonna say no that was not the value that I wanted like opinions will vary like you will decide how much value that you got out of it but if it is just a nothing area then I think a lot of people are gonna be like no that definitely wasn't worth it like if the gameplay that they add isn't fun if it is just a great big wide area with nothing else in there if it's just a small wild area with a couple of dead it's like there's a lot of ways that this can go wrong and I do agree that what value you get out of it is your own personal opinion but there is definitely a way that a game cannot deliver for the price point that everybody can agree on that didn't deliver for how much I paid for it yeah and it's also gonna be tough because it's divided in two and so you kind of have to say I'm paying $15 for one and $15 for the other right and they're spread out so it's it's gonna be a very hard the advantage that hammer very low is you have to buy both so if somebody came into the island out of armour and they were like oh this wild area is small and disappointing and not great and I don't like the dojo stuff because maybe it's battle heavy and the new clothes do nothing for me they they could walk away from that extremely disappointed but I don't think that disappointment would be strong enough for them to be like I'm just gonna skip the crown Tundra because they've already paid for the counter on Tundra I mean there's a lot of people who I mean well can do this her like I played five minutes of it it wasn't worth me and I'm not touching it again I bought DLC for Mario Cart and never played it yeah at all like so it is definitely a possibility that if the first one doesn't come out of the gate hot that people are like while I already wasted my money and I do not want to play this game or cost phallus yeah okay so the difference is between the two island of armor will be a new area yep we'll have new Pokemon a hundred of them according to Pokemon calm will have new clothing and will have handy features items and more I don't know what those are I don't know if that's like I think to some people if they added mass releasing of Pokemon through breathing I feel like to those people that is worth $30 no I I suspect this since it's a fighting focused that it will be things generous like breeding and preparing teams for doing any kind of BGC type battling will be made much easier I personally would pay $30 if they had an inverse bottle cap where I could make any pokemons speed stat zero IVs for trick room teams because breeding for 0iv trick room Pokemon is the worst experience ever but that's it's different for everyone but that's what part one says it's including part two says it's including a new area new Pokemon 100 new Pokemon a new co-op play feature which we talked about was actually walking around in the dens you go into and new clothing items and more part one has clothing items as a bullet point and handy features items and more as a bullet point this just has clothing items and more as a bullet point so I don't exactly know what that is oh I'm sure the walking around the dens it's gonna be really like that's an extensive bit of programming so that's why they couldn't do a bunch of other stuff I think I think maybe it's maybe obvious but we're not getting like a 20/20 Pokemon game we are getting one it's called mystery dungeon you sure they spent three years on sword and shield I don't know when sword and shield got finished I don't know if that was like August or September or like right up to the point because that game didn't ship with an update so what was there what was what was there when it came out and it's been two months since it came out and they have more months before the next update came out and they're using the same engine so with specifically ultra Sun ultramoon that game came out in 364 days less than a year using the same engine and they were able to deliver that game timeline wise I don't think that this seems rushed I don't I don't feel like this was content that was hidden in the game that they cut to sell back to us oh no not at all and I don't like people making that argument I've seen people make that argument I think that if this DLC had never been announced or it didn't exist that sword and shield are the same level of Pokemon game you've always gotten before that the story is there there's supposedly postgame I haven't seen but it's there's nothing about these that are less than a typical Pokemon game where I would indicate that they cut stuff out for whatever purpose first we're creating the DLC so I I don't want to see that argument angry I don't think this one is but I don't want to see that in the future and that's a concern see what in the future what we see with a lot of games where oh you cut stuff to sell you back because DLC isn't accepted like there's an inherent danger with this DLC in that they can fall into the trap that other companies have where they cut stuff from games and sell it back to you and that is that is my prime concern around any DLC anything and I have that concern here I think the breath awhile DLC was very well received I know one of them was I I know another one and they have to thank you it was love it was people were like really and I'm sure there are people that have you know like the conversation we had with wills friends last week play through the game they saw the credits they were satisfied with their sixty bucks they will not buy this not because they don't think it's the they don't think it's worth it they just are playing other games and they don't need more pokemon in their life at this point in time yep they've moved on and on the flipside my husband who's never played a lot of puck of my game about the expansion pass so we'll see let's take a break because we've become forever the long episode all right we will be right back with our question of the week and our Pokemon of the week be right back [Music] a little bit more here new characters we didn't talk about this a man named mustard will appear in the island of armor and will be responsible for players training he's a legendary trainer who held the seat of champion for 18 years back when Dynomax incorporated into battles of the Pokemon League his record has yet to be beaten in fact champion Leon himself trained under mustard and mustard was the first one to recognize Leon's talent so there you go there's some lore some history here which is cool clue Pokemon crossover confirmed yep there are two new rivals that appear in the island of our mark Laura and Avery they are skilled trainers in the dojo with a la popa berry yep okay they're skilled trainers of poison-type pokémon and psychic-type pokémon respectively and they're training hard so they can someday set up a gym and stadium of their own type trainers will face different rivals depending on which game they're playing Clara will specialize in poison-type pokémon and is training hard at mustards dojo she'll do just about anything to incorporate to appear adorable and cute as popularity is what she admires the most of all that's that's me in a nutshell I'm I try to appear adorable and cute and I aim for popularity you're only in it for the popular that's true yeah throw bad she goes about her days with a smile on her face but is hiding behind behind behind it is a calculating nature that she puts to very good use Avery is one of the trainers who strive to become stronger and musters dojo and he is a proficient user of psychic pokémon he is gentlemanly and well mannered but is also very proud and have sweet socks there was a there was a little bit of people talking about how maybe Avery is non-binary but doesn't seem to be the case according to this press release yeah which is a missed opportunity new features added in the island of armor and Crown tundra there are over a hundred wait what there will be over 100 new clothing items added in the Isle that's actually way more at well I mean are they County have a gray hoodie sweatshirt what more do they like add one hoodie and the name add 20 colors to it they in the island of armor and the Crown tundra in the island of armor trainers will also find new items that will help along their journey such as such as the experienced charm that will come in handy while leveling up their new Pokemon new tutor moves that have never been available in the past Pokemon Core Series game will also appear in the island of armor expansion along with restricted sparring where trainers will be limited to what what types of Pokemon they can be used and forced to battle under set conditions in the crown Tundra expansion trainers and their friends will be able to enter and explore dens in a new gameplay feature deep inside these dens they will have a chance to encounter legendary Pokemon from previous Pokemon core game series so for example they showed new forms of Articuno Moltres and Zapdos and they've shown old legendary Pokemon returning such as the Reggie's and what the Reggie's had new forms also it's true are they just really new reg AG's they could be the Reggie's good cool for me they looked great I can't talk about some guys no no I'm excited for them Reggie electric and Reggie Reggie little hmm Reggie what is it Reggie steel is already one so why would this one be Reggie dragon regi read many but that means that you're found at the gallery wild area will make their home on the island of armor or crown tendrá trainers will have their gallery pokedex is updated they can register even more Pokemon as they discover the island of armor players will aim to complete the isle armor pokedex while on Kandra they will be working on the crown Tundra pokedex so because these are separate pokedex 'as they're not gonna take away your shiny charm I don't know why people is like worried about that like in what reality would they be like well well it doesn't work anymore doesn't worry enough I am assuming there will probably be a reward for completing these two but who knows the real the ultra shiny charm yeah thank you finally get your ultra Chinese there are Pokemon dens on the island of armor and count a crown Tundra just like in the wild area when trainers check out the den that has a pillar of red light coming out of it they will be able to participate in a max rate battle there are battles where players will be able to team up with 300 trainers to take on dynamaxx pokemon in the Pokemon dens of the island of armor and Crown tundra trainers will be able to encounter Pokemon that are not found in the wild area they will be unable to invite their friends to join these max ray battles and just not friends who are playing using the pokemon sword expansion pass or shield expansion paths players will be able to invite to have friends even if they are playing sword and shield without the expansion patch to join them so that answers that question for people so not only can you get all 200 new Pokemon without paying you can also participate in these new max raid dens without paying would you happen to talk behind a paywall so what person pays and then everyone else benefit exactly ah there was a which of you is gonna pay ha great you already paid so well benefit off though your I'll expect checks in the mail for your thirds ok we talked about the 1.1 updates with the sneak peek if you purchase the pre order early you will get the outfits we talked about that they're kind of ugly let's let's save all the mystery dungeon stuff till next week there's actually a lot here for the mystery dungeon stuff and I don't want to just as much as I'm not a mystery dungeon fan I don't want to like give it a disservice I think that the fact that a spin-off game didn't come out on mobile is actually a big deal so we'll save all the mystery dungeon stuff for next week there is a new so to finally get to finally get away from all the DLC Pokemon news I think we covered it all there is a new online competition called the gallery newcomers you can sign up until January 30th we'll go more in depth on that next week but just like everyone who missed the signups for the first period just sign up now you don't have to register your team until the competition starts so we'll get that out of the way I do want to talk about this though but the Pokemon company also announced changes to the TCG and I want to make changes that I don't understand big changes you don't play it this was unexpected they didn't talk about this in litter echt they just posted on Pokemon comm no one ever checks Pokemon comm that's why we got to read it so the new sword and shield TCG starts February 7th 2020 will have 200 Pokemon cards it will introduce v-max Pokemon and Pokemon V cards make your jokes now there's a couple big changes I think we'll we'll have some good insight here and Greg will be like why did they make these changes true why did you do this ok these are huge changes which I think goes back to our conversation of maybe them I know Greg and I disagree on the competitive stuff but these are pretty unheard of changes in the TCG which is why I'm thinking they will make some dramatic changes in the video games the doc pack the dunk is not back in fact if they won't ever be back in fact it's even harder to dunk so the first change here is first turn at the start of X&Y series a rule was introduced to prevent a player from going from attacking on their first turn starting February 21st 2020 the date that the Pokemon TCG becomes legal for tournament play there is an additional restriction the player who goes first cannot play a supporter card on their first turn this changes to attempt to make it less and less of an advantage to go first some strategies may benefit when a player goes second but others might not work out if a player goes first we hope this results in interesting choices in both gameplay and deck building please note that the Pokemon TCG pre-release events will be played using these rules thanks like that one so will do you want to explain real quick just what a supporter card is and why it's important that you can't play now so a supporter is typically represented by a MPC from the Pokemon world you can only play one for two per turn so they usually have a more powerful effect I'm the good ones there there are always bad supporters out there but the other thing is a lot of there is a lot of supporters that do things to your opponent so if you're playing one on your first turn and doing things to your opponent that has just gotten set up when they haven't even had a chance to play at all yet that's really unfair like you could play an N on your first turn and cause your opponent to have to like just reshuffle in their height hand in and lose one card which is just mean if they like we're like looking forward to like you're having a good turn and now all of a sudden they can tap that turn that they were planning for anyways so I like that one I think they're so before the x and y change which was what x and y was 6 2004 11 years 6 years ago 5 years ago there was a statistic that said that obviously just I I'm pretty sure was if you went first you were 80% likely to win the game in the Pokemon Trading Card Game statistically and then when they they changed it so you couldn't attack on your first turn that dramatically reduced that statistic because back in the day there used to be a donk so if you went first and you were able to play a supporter on your first turn and attack on your first turn you were able to knock out your opponent before they even were able to play and you would win the game that was very very popular back in the the black and white series the donk okay this is another big change although it doesn't seem that big on it doesn't seem that big when I'm reading it but it's actually super important weakness and resistant resistance so if we're over a decade all the way black back to the diamond and pearl series resistance always meant that a Pokemon would take 20 less damage from the listed type however Pokemon introduced in Pokemon sword and shield will have a resistance of negative 30 instead of negative 20 so for example Sashi and V has a resistance of negative 32 grass-type Pokemon any Pokemon in a previous series will have a negative 20 resistance will be continued to be treated that way following what's written on the card so you might think well that's not a big deal they've only changed it from 24 to 30 what is 10 damage actually mean 10 damage like makes and breaks a lot of Pokemon Trading Card does let me ask the questions like don't ask these questions for me I have one job oh sorry Greg asked the question 'is what difference does 10 damage make that doesn't seem like a lot so so 10 damage is a lot so specifically in the black and white series I think this is the easiest to understand there there were two very dominant Pokemon that had 130 HP but the problem is almost all the Pokemon in that game did a hundred and twenty damage so is very hard to knock out a any of these Pokemon because the threshold of damage was 120 and a lot of Pokemon had 130 HP there were Pokemon that could do more than 120 damage but it was a lot harder to do that most games are won by either one shotting a Pokemon or two shotting a Pokemon yeah because there's always multipliers and everything like that so that's what you have to keep in mind so it does this deal like we've talked about it before but just does this deal with the power creep in an effective way does it deal with HP creep in an effective way like whether it's gonna be effective as TBD but okay impression that it will be or is it like something addressing it yes I think it's a way of addressing it I also think that they've done a bad job at making resistance matter for the most part like even if something had resistance which is pretty which wasn't as common as you would think you were doing so much damage anyway that it didn't matter we'll have to see how many new cards are focused on resistance and there might be more resistances because they are now changing they are not changing weakness as well so weakness is the same except they are changing matchup types which is actually huge so traditionally so let me read let me read it what what's happening and then I'll go back to traditionally water type Pokemon well we're weakness to lightning instead of grass psychic-type pokémon have a weakness to darkness instead of psychic and dark pokemon will now be weak to grass instead of fighting so there's a sense yes this is like really weird water so what they're saying is water type Pokemon were traditionally always weak to grass there were exceptions to that but now they're saying the primary the primary amount of water pokemon cards that will exist will be weak to lightning instead of grass there will probably be exceptions psychic-type pokémon were almost always weak to psychic so if first so if as Mewtwo VORs Mewtwo which is a very popular matchup because me two cards are normally very good mutant would always be weak to each other and now they're changing it so psychic-type pokémon are weak to dark-type pokémon but dark-type pokémon were always weak to fighting but now they're changing dark-type pokémon to be weak to grass which I guess technically makes sense because water will no longer be weak to grass so and just for Greg's understanding yeah why grass with that grass that's not a thing in the game grass is bug and grass like poison water grass or psychic now now poison was psychic and before psychic was psychic ghost and poison so that's why psychic was weak to psychic fighting was also fighting rock and ground yes so now here's one of the biggest changes ever the ferry type which was introduced in the X&Y series will no longer be supported and sword and shield series bad for Fairy Type I don't I don't just because very much on its own and it was being weird and it just it never should have happened yeah rude ah they like being alone don't treat your introverts like that Pokemon that we're fairy types in the video game series will now generally be represented as psychic-type pokémon envy pokemon TCG to maintain balance pokemon that our poison in the video games will not be represented as dark-type pokémon instead of psychic pokémon instead of psychic type for the time being basic fairy energy can still be used in the standard format but this mate this rule may be changed in the future so so let's let's kind of back up here when the Pokemon Trading Card Game first came out there was grass fire water lightning psychic fighting and colorless and then when they added dark and steel to the video game they then added darkness and metal to the TCG and that remained pretty unchanged until they were like until they were like let's add dragon type to the dragon wasn't too bad because it didn't have its own energy it always just relied on a combination of other energies right so when they added dragon which was a big deal they didn't add dragon well they added dragon energy but it was like a special energy it was no basic energy yeah and dragon for the most part was just weak to drag him like the video game was and then they added Fairy and they made Dragon week to Fairy and they made some dark Pokemon week to fairy but not all dark Pokemon were strong to psychic because psychic was usually weak to psychic but then also some dark Pokemon were weak to fighting so if anything all fairy really did was make dark pokemon be in this weird spot uh and made dragons be in a weird spot and then like Fairy was only weak to for the most part metal because poison Pokemon were classified as psychic but fairy was never weak to psychic so you have this type which was supposed to make the game more fun but instead it just made pretty much all Dracon pokemon pretty useless and it didn't actually benefit metal pokemon like you would think like oh well you just counter fairy with metal but metal was still never really good because metal was also weak to fire and some were weak to fighting I don't know it's it's kind of hard to explain because there's always exceptions to that you could always look at a card and you could be like oh this one's weak to something but it added this weird not like loophole it just you you would think you're adding a mechanic to make the game more fun and I don't think ferry ever felt like oh boy this is even more fun now that we're playing with fairy well I mean my first Sarnia stack was and then it wasn't fun anymore yeah thumbs up thumbs down from both you thumbs up very going away go thumbs up thumbs up yeah thumbs up this actually makes me really fell into the game yeah play it um I still don't like the like best two-out-of-three that they have like I understand the best two out of three because like sometimes you can get caught off-guard by a deck but now that you know how the deck works you have such a good advantage to maybe counter that the next time you play it's just pokemon TCG games take way too long and so when you're in a tournament setting of like okay it's best two out of three and you lose the first match and that was like a 25 minute game you have like 20 minutes to try to tie it and then you have this like third game that's going to go to time so you might as well just flip a coin of who wins cuz it's like who's gonna go first and who's gonna get set up faster and we only have three times you're gonna get disqualified but you know what I mean like ideally like the smart played to do would be like okay I'm losing so I'm gonna scoop right away within like the first ten minutes so I can get a better second game in so I can get a strong third game in but inherently like they could still drag out that second game so you can't even get a strong third game in and the Pokemon to the Pokemon video the Pokemon VGC has built-in timers and those games go much faster so even if like the time limit was 45 minutes the timer in the game is 15 minutes locked so you can fit three games in in 45 minutes or at most you're going to win two games at at at most in 30 minutes so you get 15 minutes to like recoup before the next match and and that's to say if your game is going to 15 minutes so I still think an inherent problem with the TCG is how long it takes which I don't know if I don't know I don't know if the new cards will make those games feel faster and still fun but I think removing fairy-type is a good is good I think it's fine um and then I think ideally you see more dragon and you probably still don't see more metal but metal is its whatever metal is whatever like I don't know how you save metal for metal at this point um but uh sure I mean it'll exist I'm trying to think if there was any actually really good metal decks and I can't think of one right now uh Reggie Steele had like a half second in the Sun yeah I think melt metal had a quarter of a second in the Sun for a most part there are some other changes they've they've changed some cards specifically for expanded lakelyn berry palp add citrus very quick ball those were changed there's a now a new term called Pokemon checkup which replaces the phase between turns after a player completes a turn you will enter the checkup phase you will check for special conditions in this order poison burned asleep and paralyzed you will check abilities that happen during the checkup phase it's pretty much just an extra step to make sure everyone's doing what they should be doing they've changed some regulation marks they've changed some text removal reminders of like hey make sure you check if it says before you attack or after you attack or they will probably start writing cards with during the check up phase on them in black and white they started using the term heal for example it would say heal 30 damage from your Pokemon prior to that it would say remove 30 damage count of 3 damage counters from your Pokemon in sword and shield a similar term will be introduced going forward this term will be called recover so the pokémon center lady has been updated in sort and shield to say heal 60 damage from one of your Pokemon and it will recover all special conditions it will still have the same effect but it does not recover renamed as recover yeah big changes very very unexpected I think very positive changes but we'll see there's a bunch of Pokemon good news new Pokemon got added to Pokemon girl we'll talk about that next week there was a new movie preview from Japan we'll talk about that next week we could probably talk about a lot of things that week cuz this is really long yeah Gabe sent in the TCG stuff so thank you Kevin sent in the movie stuff so thank you Brandon sent in the build-a-bear stuff no thank you question of the week Greg alright ready if you don't ask the snow you will never ask it again we are just here waiting for the question of the question of the week I don't know that one name that tune it's new game I can't I don't know it I don't like I know well we'll leave it for everybody else ok ask the question in a world that now has Pokemon the dlc and given what we've seen so far what would you like to see in the dlc that has not been seen an actual storyline like how good a star we talking like rainbow rocket or better than that um I would so if there's something as like rainbow rocket actually had a fairly okay story like but they just sort of like stopped it I would like to see like a similar storyline along those but you know that maybe gave me I don't know five extra hours of storyline content to go through like that's that's what I want like I would like an actual look reason for Rose doing anything that he did or more lore stuff or like an exploration of what happened to the two heroes why they dropped onto one like all those unanswered questions I would like tied up oh yeah and plotlines like give me conclusions to those stories have me have hop starting research with Sonia to find more answers like if I get five hours of that and each like hey we found out in this tundra this is you know the king Pokemon and this is how this changes everything like if I got five hours of story line that sort of tied off a lot of those and ends I'd be happy well what do you what do you want ability to change my pokeballs two different pokeballs hmm I don't know I mean there's so much that this game can do for me at this point still that the the field is open you know I'm just I'm just looking for an enjoyable adventure maybe I mean I would say contests you know once again something different a different way to compete that's not battling but hobby I don't think we're going to see that so I would like to also see like maybe Morden brand-new Pokemon - that'd be good yeah yeah like more glaring forms or more actual just cooler in Pokemon like we're getting we got a hints of a few of that but if there are like five more to the Pokedex I would be probably happy with that - yeah what do you want Steve uh I was I was serious I've mentioned earlier I was serious about like a reverse bottle cap the mints the bottle caps like they've made everything easy for breeding like they are that is true that you could find it max ten raid four muds Dale catch said muds Dale level it pretty easily with candy give it a mint if it's the wrong nature and then bottle cap what you need to and it's good to go and that is super fast and probably what people want but you cannot do that at all if you're making a trick room team there's just like having thirty-one in having perfect speeds that is the opposite of what you want and if it was a if it was like even if you weren't running a trick room team like having a thirty one in in physical attack on a Chandeleur is not great one because you're not going to use it and two you're probably going to get foul played which is a very popular dark type move that is used in competitive and foul play is based off of your physical attack so Chandeleur with a high physical attack is there's like a difference between foul play killing you in two turns and foul play killing you in three turns so they've made it easy to get competitive Pokemon already unless you were dependent on having slow Pokemon and there is a reason why you would want Pokemon to be slow besides trick room or to have a lower attack because even if your attack was high that would mean you would take more confusion damage so again any like special Pokemon does not need a high attack just because of confusing being a status condition so if they had a bottle cap that made a major IVs zero I think that would be the final tool for somebody building competitive things I don't know if I'm missing anything else it would be very nice to have a shiny hunty a new shiny hunting method in the game I don't know if they would be so bold to do that I think that the shiny hunting in this game is I talked about this before on Twitch but when I'm shiny hunting in this game all shiny hunting is boring let me get that out of the way i I just feel like I wish I was doing something else because the other things to do in sword and shield are more fun like when everyone recently this past week was getting different flavors of alchemy I was like man that seems way more fun than to be riding my bike in a circle or knocking out 500 mer actus I do like the fact that the knock out the catch method rewards you permanently and I think with Pokemon games it's always a marathon not a sprint so if you're knocking out you know 30 Crammer ants a day within two months your Krammer ants shiny chance will be permanent forever and you will probably run into one cry moraine a day in the future so I do like that I just think the I just think that method is is it will be more rewarding in six months than it is right now and so to give players maybe something else like a third option would be kind of nice I think I don't think it's a fault to the shining hunting in the game I think shiny hunting is always inherently boring I just think that sword and shield has done a good job of making you care about other things like hey we promoted Pokemon this week in max raid dens maybe you should do them or hey we're starting a new gallery tournament at the end of this week or hey season 2 started and you can earn bottlecaps by participating I think it's done a very good job of doing that and I think it's gonna do a very good job in June where it's like hey we have a whole new area for you to explore are you sure you want to spin in a circle for over the next five days hatching eggs so that that's what I think I would like to see are they yeah bottle caps and maybe like a new shiny hunting method in in the game will Pokemon of the week alright last week spoke amount of the week it was a poem I'll read it again in the matter of finding our Pokemon creatures particular aspects we must reconcile their name their species abilities quite surely but also their route where they domicile and you Nova on 4 and 18 if you're lucky you'll see this week's eating a yeah Papa berry in Kalos in hordes on route 5 there are many practicing to intimidate to appear very scary on our return to Hoenn we travelled quite far to 1:13 and then we must look very closely this week's Pokemon can only be found if it peeks out its head perhaps to be nosy while visiting a Lola our first trip no dice yet on our return without too much luck we discovered some boys before the red meadow and some girls near the town with a broken-down truck grand gala with its castles its curries its camps appears to have two routes we can place the mystery pokémon moto Stoke outskirts is one and Galler mind number two it does grace one last bit of advice if he would be so keen to find a species member with the ability stated travel to the wild area peer into a den if it's in a max raid you'll be quite elated alright who's that so easy who's the pokey [Laughter] it's scolipede well you got part of it right it's scraggy its scraggy scolipede is not even in as far as I know no it's that well not yet not yet for 30 bucks though maybe ya behind the paywall you'll get it scraggy has no trivia about it it was - that is right Percy based on a sort of lizard in addition with cranky since it encapsulates stereotypes of youth subcultures and I particularly hip-hop or punk hmm got the Mohawk - did have a scraggy it has grown yes Maggie it always used to hit its head on things it was very cute chef alai comes pretty good I honestly can't tell the difference between the shiny oh it's one of those is it yeah and look oh it's is it just that it's a slightly darker orange yeah it's it's it's pretty obvious in certain shield the 3ds had been very bad color differences true yeah that's a lot darker okay will I guess okay next week's something a little different for you although I'll be in Texas next week so if people are gonna have two weeks to chew on this one previous to science identifying that we live in a deterministic universe the ancients believed that gods or demigods set out the path that human lives would take the apportion errs in Greece Clotho Lachesis and atropos or the scandinavian Dorn's for example you roar Varane tea and scold bird on D I'm sorry mispronounced that one an indo-european descent in cultures fates are typically represented as three there is a resident of an East our city that frequently speaks of fate in video game manga and anime alike they frequently speak of what is to come as a warning so that hopefully the foreseen can be changed they also present a Trinity sigilyph with the MIT with the ability magic guard Slowking with the ability oblivious and meowstic female with the ability infiltrator while anistar city is known for its large sundial this week's individual is known for two items first they wear a cloak with a star-filled pattern print a zero-gravity is set to promote psychic power second they have a bracelet large enough for two wrists it has been said that if you place your wrist within this bracelet our individual can see what your future holds in store in the strange twisting of time that occurred around the mega evolution special they were able to prepare Kalos for the potential calamity of the battle between primal Groudon and primal Kyogre they also had insight into the eventual disposition of squishy before the series completion in the TCG this individual has a card that works much like the card switch except it also heals the benched pokémon for 30 see I used heals like we did in back on white days mmm alright that's it that's it that's our show of super long one yeah host didn't didn't expect this
