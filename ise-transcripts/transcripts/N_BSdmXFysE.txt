[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 406 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is will i'm trying to get sponsored this week but that's for our youtube viewers that they'll catch that maybe i'm a fitness influencer greg i get sponsored i just killed greg there you go it's just me and you steve because greg just died fitness definitely missed a memo because because you're wearing you're wearing a slightly athletic shirt well from a company that like literally only makes money by sponsoring instagram and youtube i mean i get tons of message from that's gay on instagram they want me to be in it there you go the most garbage dms in the world hi i'm here it is once again this is your half year reminder that this has been the worst 25th anniversary special ever i'm thinking maybe we just called this the 24th anniversary like everything was delayed a year like the good stuff next year next year's the actual 25th i was thinking about this while in the shower as as i do in the shower think about pokemon non-stop that's my life repaired fyi i had to take a cold shower today and i'm kind of upset about it and wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on i have more showers than people in my house you could always come and take a shower over here i mean it is on the table at this point okay okay wait did something happen to your shower so you know how you have the single knob that mixes hot and cold yeah i mean if you're if you're if you're that kind of shower person i mean i don't i i didn't ask for it to be that way that's the way it is and i've accepted my shower how many years have you owned your home like a million i don't know okay step it up like what did they call it when it's like raise the level you can't watch they'll explain how to fix your shower and like not even but you need your own cold you need your own hot you set that perfect temperature yeah so the thing used to set the perfect temperature and now it's decided that no matter how far you turn it no hot none no hot [ __ ] no more hot what were you thinking about steve hot [ __ ] everywhere else hot don't come from shower i have lost interest in greg's tales of whoa what were you thinking about in the showers this podcast can't be too long because i don't have air conditioning this weekend what my well first off i rent so it's not my costly problem but my the thing that's outside the the ac condenser sure maybe yeah the condenser is broken i don't think the whole thing is called a condenser though now you're right but it's this is the ac unit is it out of juice what is it oh it's broken broken like it doesn't turn on at all um well the fan spins but it's just the guy came out once again now for our audio listeners prize bonus package for you the gentleman and i use that term loosely who just complained about their ac being broken therefore we cannot provide you with the three hours of glorious audio content that i had prepared is wearing wearing a sweatshirt a hoodie sweatshirt not even like this is perfect tank top situation yes didn't even join the club last time and is wearing a thick a thick hoodie i mean that thing is so is that that thing is so t-h-i-c-c i i can see the thick from here and and in layers and it's like it's hot because i have no ac yet i'm going to dress like it's the polar vortex correct you know we just record fast enough before the computers and the lights heat up this room we're good too late it's not the area okay for forgetting okay so let's let's take this 25 no we're done with the shower 25th anniversary pokemon we've hit our we've had our three minutes of side talk quota we got to move into the pokemon stuff yeah nobody likes the pokemon stuff because nothing's happening the science is where the magic is in a year we got pokemon snap mm-hmm we're getting pokemon unite and we're getting diamond and pearl remakes i think that is a pretty solid pokemon year video game wise and for a normal year yeah that's not a normal year last year was just um mystery dungeon and then the dlc no no no getting pokemon snap pokemon unite and diamond and pro remakes in a year in a normal year would be a good year for a 25th anniversary year i'm like i filed my divorce papers honey because roses ain't gonna do it anymore roses was yes our 24th anniversary when you took me to mcdonald's because you thought that's where we had our first date which was actually at arby's now thanks oh you never forget that roast beef i i uh well somehow they did pokemon tcpci forgot the roast beef and and we're done i i can't i can't handle i'm a person who needs commemoration and acknowledgement and you ain't doing it for our 25th anniversary so i need to find a 25th anniversary what is it ditch that zero get a hero yeah that's that's where i'm at right now i heard zelda is having a big annual sweet no joke go to metroid go to metroid we compare our anniversary to zelda we're having the best anniversary ever because all they got was a weird game boy thing greg metroid's a girl i'm sorry to tell you i'm sorry to break it to you what [Laughter] i'm sorry metroid is a woman i never got to the end of of of metroid so how was i to know that because there's going to be like somebody furiously typing that metroid is not the actual play like that i understand that's the joke explain it there to prevent that comment from coming i need to once again point out the banner year that was 2012 not an anniversary year that had more pokemon releases this year give me the releases 2012 2012 had black and white two okay 2012 had pokemon uh conquest yes had uh poker park 2 wonders beyond had learn with pokemon typing adventure okay that didn't come in the united states does that matter is there something in japan we're not being told about is japan keeping the great 25th anniversary from us because we kept national decks away from them is this what you're telling me uh pokemon rumble blast oh there you go uh mystery dungeon gaze to infinity came out in japan in 2012. there you go uh okay you name 2012. those are not a good year but also the reason that all of those came out in 2012 was because of the mayan calendar apocalypse so they needed to get all that content out before the world came to an end i forgot black two white two very good conquest very good the problem with those two games though is the 3ds already existed and that was like end of life cycle uh is the switch not been around for like three no i just re i personally regret selling my ds and then trying to play ds games on a three like the because i went from a ds ds uh uh xl the big one yes to a small 3ds and all ds games look like hot trash on the never sell anything look at this look i i had mine until i broke it i had the same one i had the same one two years old in 2013. no excuses i couldn't have looked greg i couldn't afford pokemon box and pokemon two copies of coliseum like you i didn't have adult money i had you were going to cut no one is an adult at 22. you are still a child at 22. oh you got that right things i have within reach i have this commemorative uh white pokemon white d.s right i have we only do video podcasts because greg forces us two students they can show that didn't they have like uh reshiram and zekrom diaz look at how beautiful this is how come greg doesn't have the cause it didn't come to america oh are you sure i wanted the i wanted the gold one and i didn't actually no no no no no no restaurant wrestle ones did come oh i could go into the other room and grab my uh torchic uh game boy advance that i imported from japan so that i could show off to how do you have so much money do you put any money towards retirement or do you just invest in nintendo systems uh we're used to this is how many ancient muse greg has got a vault this household is a dink household double income no kids yeah so like lastly i also had very bad habits with my credit cards earlier in my life see i did too and then i resorted in selling a lot of the stuff i collected because i wanted to get out of that oh i have one more hold on oh dear i forgot it's pink it's yellow i had that one i sold that one oh i tried to get that one that's the pikachu 3ds the weird thing is where the cameras line up very weird on that one yes so i don't think that this is you're right like as as an anniversary year not the strongest but as a pokemon year not the worst year they've had it's not the worst year what's the worst year they had do we suppose probably the year they just released omega ruby and nothing else nah something probably came out that year 2018 uh 2018 head let's go pikachu let's go eevee yeah there you go those guys are good is that all they have i'm going through no because that would have had quest as well i think in 2018 yeah um anyways as greg's looking that up let's get into our first bit of news here speaking of new pokemon games pokemon unite new information finally revealed i got the press release here the pokemon company international and timmy is that where you're saying it taimai i'm going to say timeline that sounds way cooler i like saying today it was just it was the other one was pokemon uh quest that was it question let's go for that year bad year oh quest was a good you know both those games are good i mean i'm not saying the good games are good or bad i'm saying the amount of releases were tiny yeah but i feel like in a year that you release a rumble game you actually like lose eight points but no people out there who are unsubbing because look we we we've already moved into news pokemon united that shall divide us all yes uh finally uh it is 90 we're poke are we picking our mains right now right here live i gotta get through the press release think about your mains i will get through uh pokemon's first strategic team battle game unite will release in july of 2021 on the nintendo switch and september of 2021 on mobile devices unite will be free to start with optional in-game purchases cross platform play between the nintendo switch and the mobile device is planned which allows players to uh which allows players on both platforms to battle together additionally you may use your trainer club account or nintendo account on both the switch and the mobile to keep progress synced between the devices that whole paragraph right there sounds awesome cross play synced linking good i'm into that i'm i'm a i'm a big time linker i've linked since i was a child love linking uh there's a trailer on the official unite youtube channel uh they say welcome to a aeos island is that we're saying it aios how is it spelled a-e-o-s no i'm just not pronouncing it next unite takes place on eos island a mythical island said to be on the ocean's unexplored frontier on the island players will find the ubc unite battle committee which runs a series of unite battle tournaments in unite battles players will take a team of five and compete against each other to see who can have the most who can score the most points before time runs out players will also experience a new form of energy known as eos energy eos energy can be used in unite battles to evolve pokemon these unite battles have passionate fans all over the world and trainers everywhere to join in on the action you'll take on the role of a rookie trainer who comes to aeos to take part in these battles the rules of unite battles uh trainers and their partner pokemon complete five on five battles the key in the unite is to have a higher score than the other team when time runs out to earn points for your turn team you must gather eos energy by defeating wild and opposing pokemon and then deposit the energy in the opposing team's goal zone unite battle will take place in various stadiums the rule of each stadium differs and there can be a different number of teams different match lengths and different legendary pokemon that appear there's like a lot in that paragraph that they did not talk about in the trailer [Music] face off against skill teams in unite battle cooperating with teammates is important when battling a skilled team or when at a disadvantage you might be able to open a path to victory by coordinating with teammates in ranked matches you can earn performance points which will increase or decrease on your rank depending on the results of battle when starting out you will be in the beginner cup level and you can make your journey to mastercup additionally those who become ranked will be recorded on the global ranking leaderboard for the world to see level up before every unite battle all pokemon are returned to level one through this is a common uh moba thing for those that haven't played moba throughout the through the power of aos energy and throughout each battle you will gain experience points and level up as a pokemon level up they learn more moves and evolve when a pokemon reaches higher levels it also learns a unite move a powerful move that can be learned and used in united battles unite moves can change the tide of a battle that would probably be just your super your ultimate alt use the right terminology it's your alt battle with a fresh look in pokemon unite you can change the appearance of your pokemon and trainer take part in unite battles showing off your unique style you can use hollow wear a special technology that uses eos energy to dress your pokemon in a variety of outfits you can also customize your trainer's appearance clothing and accessories to make sure your trainer is always looking the best both in and out of battle you can update your profile with you not unite snapshot that features your trainer avatar your partner pokemon and you can even customize your snapchat by changing your trainer's expression pose and adding stickers before entering a match you can see other players snapchat too this is where they get you to spend the money because all this playing will be good skins get wins buddy yep many different pokemon such as charizard pikachu greninja will appear uh although the strengths and weaknesses do not exist in united battle there you go so no type advantage uh each pokemon has a unique stat role attack defender speedster supporter or all around that reflect different play styles you can practice with different pokemon look there's no practicing i'm picking cramer um ahead different pokemon to find out which bet suits you in pokemon in united battles you have a united license for that pokemon unite license can be attained throughout the united battle committee where you can exchange eos coins for your desired license enjoy even more unite with the battle pass you'll have the opportunity to earn in-game rewards through a seasonal battle pass to earn these rewards you need to level up by completing missions additionally players can upgrade their battle passes by using eos gems enabling them to claim even more rewards and finally you can obtain items via the shop pokemon unite has three emojis three in-game currencies eos gems paid eos coins and eos tickets eos coins and tickets can be acquired by playing the game at the unite battle committee players can use eos coins and eos gems to obtain unite licenses which will allow them to take pokemon into battle these this is we'll get to this an eos uh emporium players can use eos coins or eos gems to obtain ubc approved goods like pokemon held items or trainer fashion items fashion items can also be obtained using eos tickets xerco trading specializes in hollow wear which can be used with eos gems okay where do we want to start we want to start with just the thoughts on the trailer i mean the trailer is cool it was good it was a good trailer it's a good trailer it was very hype um i mean i want to play the game i would say that the i feel like as it's funny because when this podcast started 11 years ago we never really talked about anything of worth worth noting but we never really talked about like the how people felt about things and that's like a very i feel like that's a very common thing now in just social media of like what was the vibe after this happened well there barely was social media you didn't know what the vibe was i didn't care what the vibe was and last year when we were like the vibe for unite was very negative and it was mostly because of 10 cent um yeah and when this trailer came out i didn't really see anyone be like people seemed very excited i don't know if it just needed the time to breathe um or what they showed what was more exciting than what they talked about last year but uh i felt this last week people have been really excited for unite because of this trailer so i guess that's i mean that's good i mean i'm excited for you tonight so it's it's exciting to see other people excited for united i think they were i mean there were a lot of people who were excited for unite when it first came out last time too i think that uh what it what are we nine months later when we get the second trailer the people that were adamantly against it are just like whatever like i don't think well i think they're they've moved on to i hate chibis these are the worst remakes that have ever happened how could they do this to my trees these these time frames are too close like they've they've moved their ire onto other things and i don't think i don't think this game registers like they already wrote it off and so the people who are just like i like all things pokemon are here like yay this looks really cool and the people who are like i hate everything and i want to complain about it have moved on to the the the games they quote unquote see as main games or they care about but i think there's a lot of people who are very excited for it i'm excited for it yeah i i hope i like it as somebody you do too yeah i don't like you i played mobas yeah that's the thing is i never really played any like i've never played league i've never played dota i mean i've watched probably like an hour of league in the last like five years you know ten minutes here five minutes i don't remember which one it was um i mean they look very similar the main difference is so i do we need to get into the technical details of the difference between league and dota no i don't i don't i don't think so i mean what it comes down to is character selection but yeah so i think the trailer was good um they did the closed beta last month in canada which i think we said on the show and i think everyone kind of expected that like oh if they're doing an english-speaking country they must be close to done um yeah either australia or canada they always get the good stuff first and the interesting thing is i saw some people be like wow it's coming to switch first not mobile i think this makes sense i don't know why this is a shocker there are more mobile devices out there than switch so if you want to make sure your server is not overloaded you pick the platform that is smaller um although i feel like if i loved this game i don't know if that's gonna be true or not i would assume that like an ipad or whatever android people use whatever that is more powerful than a switch so if i really love this game i feel like i would get i would use my ipad and then just sync a playstation 4 controller to it and play it that way what do you need the power for because the graphics in this game aren't so great probably just like like frame rate stuff yeah or like lag which i which i don't know how much that matters in a mobile because i've never played it right like when i'm playing like it matters ping matters yes right like definitely matters but what kind of confuses me is like one of the core things of moba play is my right hand i guess maybe left hand if you're left-handed is on the mouse and my other hand is on q-w-e-r right oh okay so you've got what's three attacks um like how how's that do they replicate that on a controller you just joystick to move and then a x b y yeah it's not the same [Laughter] the same are you in in dota and league are you clicking to move like in diablo you you click to where you want to go and your dude just like walks towards the last place because i think diablo 3 on ps4 or switch because it came out on everything i thought because they don't have the click to move anymore they just have the stick and i thought they when they did that change because i played diablo 3 and mac and then when it came to ps4 irene and i got it because we liked playing together and that that change wasn't jarring to me like they blizzard figured it out i i don't know people are very particular about what they use to control their games but yes if you if you ever want like the if if you asmr for clicking noises sit in a room with somebody who's playing either league or dota because like like two of my closest friends one's a league player one's a dota player and it's literally just like click click click click click click click cause they're just constantly clicking around yeah um and i think now folks don't come at me because it's been a very long time since i played league it's like left click is where your character walks towards right click is how you aim your attack but even on so it's coming to like mobile which is iphone android phone tablet ipad is a touch screen experience what you want i guess maybe like an android phone you could probably hook up a mouse right but but you why are you assuming that the switch version isn't going to be touch screen the switch is a touch screen oh i don't think for at all it's going to be touching i mean it would would it not if it's touch screen that would it not project on the tv did they say that it maybe it doesn't maybe it's a hammer i don't know if in the press release it says what like that would be weird as one of the selling points of the switch that it wouldn't i mean it's not out of the question i'll double check the website but technically cafe mix is you touch screen like i don't think you play cafe mix on the switch with controllers a pro controller i don't know if it says on the website the controllers that you can use although we shouldn't overly compare it to league and dota just because yes it's a moba but there i think there are even in what we've been shown significant differences right because you're not attacking towers your goal is not to do them like destroy the enemy's goal zone it's more like soccer and it's like scoring points i don't know if we can ever get away from that though i mean like you make a mo like any moba's gonna get compared to dota and league and yeah battle royale is gonna get compared to apex or fortnite but and yeah but we also we didn't see enough like right so much about dota and league is like top lane mid lane bottom lane jungle and i don't know from what i've read it almost seems like the whole thing is just jungle [Laughter] i don't know who are the creeps who are the minions what are we farming here we we have we have roster i'll just run through the roster i i don't think everyone will be available at the start but this is the of all the ones that have been officially announced pikachu charizard snorlax crustal greninja eldagas talonflame lucario venusaur mr mime slobro apsil machamp wigglytuff alolan ninetales cramerant gengar garchomp and cinderese and thank you what's not on here but they did officially announce is blastoise and gardevoir and a third character are eventually coming um but i can't remember how they worded this like some of these characters will be free and then you have to pay your you when you earn your gosh gems is paid when you earn your like tickets you can use your tickets or your coins to unlock these characters or you can just pay for them outright to unlock them which is a very apex legends thing yeah yeah but i think that's more league than dota but in in apex legends you had like eight characters and then mirage and caustic where the the um you must unlock with currency and you could either play apex for like 20 some hours to unlock them for free or you could just buy them up front i think they were nine bucks um and now at this point because you play so much apex when they release a new character you probably have enough of that currency just to unlock them for free i would assume that's going to be the same in unite they add characters but if you've been playing since day one when that character drops you probably have enough of the free currency to unlock it without spending money i have a fundamental question are you on the pokemon unite webpage unite.pokemon.com yeah i'm here are you on the overview page i am on the pokemon page go to the overview page yes i'm here scroll down to rewards uh i see it that dude's got a sable light and i want sableye is a helper there's other pokemon in the game that aren't gameplay pokemon oh that's because he's that seller he's in charge of zerko trading he's the he's the seller he's the clothes seller doesn't matter i want that same lie it's in the game give it to me uh hero style beach style and magician style i want that sable it's so cute i'm so mad uh all right who's your main will because we know who steve's meaning how is this even a question what the oh is obviously a crustal fan he's obviously a lucario guy i'm not support i am a support player well then you ain't playing the cram no that's probably true yeah even though i like the cram i'm i'm usually a support player in in games normally like i play crypto in apex even though so let me will who who have they already been calling to get nerfed because it's op in a game that you can't even play yet charizard no ninja no cinders cinderache no we once again have killed greg greg knows the answer i've been saying this for a year now which pokemon is op in pokemon steve because it's killing me mr mime mr mime i'm trying to think i'm looking i've literally said this since day one can you not remember flame talent you know i i i'm looking at the list here and i am normally a support player and i i will say that slowbro is really standing out to me slowbro got that four out of five stars in support i don't think there's a single pokemon with five stars in support uh except slowpro's not in support slope bro is a defender i feel like a defender is a support role well unfortunately the ones that are literally called support are el degas mr mime and wigglytuff so slow bro is not a healer slow bro has a four i i didn't say specifically healing i said specifically support silver has a four out of five i believe what they mean by defender is i don't know what a defender is in uh in uh moba i think it's tank sucks sucks up damage doesn't do a lot of damage sucks so you mean like the the the guy with the giant shield in overwatch that dude yeah right reinhardt don't ever mention overwatch ever again please yeah i played overwatch for at least a for at weekend five minutes somebody did the calculation of how much those five minutes each minute cost five thousand dollars now because of the life you lost playing it so steve is either cramer ant or slow bro uh i'm not opposed to elder goss or wigglytuff though they said quote you back off i have already claimed my space i've never blamed two one is aldegast and do you know what the other is all the nine tails yes i have claimed them as my space so get out of it until gardevoir shows up and then i make things my space got shut down like 10 years ago it's back my space is back oh but i said how many elder goss plushes you got cause i got at least one uh i'm not a fool with my money i buy dx's and keep them so i can play the games that i like instead of wasting it on plushes that will sit in the background for people to stare at goodness this game looks awesome i mean it looks fun i hope it's fun i mean i i okay there's three of us now we need two more yeah you think bobby and al are good enough or we gotta we gotta what about britney you think brittany probably carries right bev uh bev would would do a couple rounds i took bobby i mean here's the thing bobby we know we'll buy everything so yeah but i feel like bobby would get distracted with like checking pokemon it's like thank god bobby's an accountant because that dude gets pulled into every financial scam that exists also bobby has no patience so he'll have all the characters unlocked right away yeah true yeah that doesn't mean for us wait stephen was a big league of legends player wasn't he oh steve does yeah league absolutely count count on him for sure in the game which which one does he get venusaur done sold oh nick will only provide commentary yeah play video games i think nick would be a very good coach yeah could well that would require nick to know what he's doing no i think it's better when he doesn't know what he's doing okay yeah i think it's that kind of a situation what about maddie or vince ah the problem is maddie and vince are such gentle souls and this game is all about violence you've you've played magic with this there's nothing gentle about what i would say and vince are both rage quitters we can't have that on the team maddie's a rage quitter i've known her for 10 plus years okay that'll give you i don't know that i don't know that vince is a rage quitter all right so the three of us stephen for sure uh we'll see how everything plays with bobby and the bobby will get distracted with a raid and have to go do poke also bobby has kids we can't we can't have players this is this is a competitive team this is this is this is you've got a child you've you've disqualified yourself from competitive yep because we are gonna have to do the circuit we will have to travel the world for the pokemon unite circuit we will get matching uniforms get on that deal with your athletic wear will so that we can get actual uniforms for free get that g feel sponsorship we already got the g fuel not for this we just have you you aren't sharing them profits we get our own flavor we have to come up with the team name oh yeah but i mean our team name is gonna inform our flavor yeah yeah like and the [Music] slush rush what because slush rush is an ability but it also sounds like a flavor of g fuel but it also is fun to say and it sounds like a sick team the pk men cast slush we're cutting off rush we're cutting out the first part we're just doing slush rush rush we are not giving in to your unique branding we are not here to build up steve we are here to build up the team this is why steve is never a good team he's not a team player not he'll be like i'm slow growing over here look at me and we're out there working hard to get the points to get the wins and we get the wins he takes the glory hmm i yeah i'm pretty bad at video games it's like this podcast we do the work he gets the wins it's why i'm crypto in apex because i i hang back when both teammates die i revive them with my drone and then i'm like well do it again because i'm not good enough the main thing to worry about in team building is you've got to also figure out who's going to be the backup when i get tired of all of you and leave and somebody's gonna have to take my place oh when's the last time we talked to jeff they're very good at video games oh true yeah we get jeff oh jack jack jeff is in subbing out will immediately and jeff is the good child i would say caller calls the best sure no yeah jeff was the best splatoon 2 player i've ever known oh jeff logan and i murdered in splatoon we we were an amazing team ooh logan's good too logan's great logan actually that's probably your all-star right there logan's are all-stars all that dude does is play video games i don't even not certain that they actually have a job anymore i mean i can confirm that they do [Laughter] all right uh let's take a break uh and when we come back we got some more pokemon news [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we are back i we we got to go back to unite why we are you changing your mind on what you're going to play now no but but we didn't get will's second choice what happens if talonflame gets drafted but does it in league or dota you like eliminate the other players so pokemon so you they can't pick it that is a dota thing that each okay that team gets a certain number of eliminations correct because they don't eliminate uh i mean in this little thing that they're showing there are like four greninjas on screen why are you playing no greninja i'm just saying i don't think telephone's gonna get removed wait no there's there's no way they're gonna let you pick four ninjas on the same team why not because that's not how it works it's a team of five you have five greninjas yeah you can't pick the same apex character you can't pick the same overwatch character you can't say the same apex this ain't overwatch gengar obviously yeah obviously gengar oh i didn't know you were a gengar boy of course i'm again every time that i let me use polite language uh took out your kitchen in pokken tournament i was gengaring your mess you were yes oh i was such a gengar man uh this game will have a battle pass uh i don't know if you guys play specifically any games that have a battle pass yourself i mean i have a monthly subscription to final fantasy yeah yep that i pay six months at a time so it's pretty cheap um so i'm just i i wanna i wanna go over the battle passage because this is new to pokemon and i'm sure there are lots of listeners there are probably a handful of listeners that play dota or league or overwatch or whatever there's probably a handful of listeners that listen to the show that haven't done in this at all um so usually a battle pass is a set amount of time uh could be 60 days could be 90 days you pay normally like 10 bucks and then when you level up that battle pass normally uh there could be 30 levels 60 levels 100 levels every time you level it up you earn rewards and there's usually i don't know if this game is going to do it there's usually a free battle pass and then there's a paid battle pass oh greg we played clash royale they had they had the free and paid battle pass their battle pass was five bucks though yeah and their battle pass was you suckered me into that twice and i oh never okay clash royale did such a good job at convincing you to get the battle pass because it would then show so you're right in your clan or your friends list bought the battle pass so when the battle pass came out and you would log into like clash royale had like this like chat built in you would see everyone purchase the battle pass and then you would be like oh i don't like everyone has it but me like it was like this social pressure it was it was very good it was very bad and i got i i got snookered into it and then um so the battle pass usually rewards you with uh well at least so i wanna apex's battle pass is i think it's like 10 bucks you get to 110 is their max level you have 90 days to do it and they say that if you can max it out you actually get your 10 back because you get it back in coins [Music] and they have like skins and they have emotes and they have it's mostly skins they have like weapon charms and then they have like the little loot boxes i don't know if they they didn't say in this press release if this game has loot boxes at all which is like a thing in overwatch you know you level up you get a loot box um so they haven't said that but uh i'm curious if this game will have it where there is a free battle pass and if like halfway through the season you decide oh i want to get the battle pass now because i i didn't get to play the first like three weeks but now i'm playing a lot if it remembers that like oh you earned this amount so this is what apex does if you got to like level 50 on the free battle pass and you decide okay i'm gonna pay for the battle pass now it will give you all the retro rewards and then start you at like whatever level you were um and then the other thing is like let's say you're getting i've only done this once if it's like the last day of the season and you're like level 98 and you're like i really want the level 100 reward they let you pay money to skip levels so like i was 98 one season and the the season ended in like 12 hours and it was like 4 00 a.m or something and i was like i could keep playing or i could just give them six bucks and i'm gonna go to bed because i wanted the level 100 rewarding that's how they get you yeah that's what they're gonna get there in the morning making poor choices with their life yeah oh i mean that's how i spend 30 on garden escape so i just go can't judge i'm i'm really though like overall i've never been like against battle passes there are definitely some battle passes where i felt like they were pretty lackluster um but i think we're on we're on season eight of apex and i think i've bought seven of the eight battle passes and i think i finished three of them but i never felt like even if i did finish it i never felt like i was like super ripped off i didn't feel like i was ripped off i mean i was gonna play the game anyways so giving 10 bucks every three months for a game i like i never felt like oh they're really pulling a fast one over on me oh clash royale maybe i didn't feel satisfied with that five dollars i did the very first time and the second time i was really regretting it and then we just left the game all together and never came back like how i do drop the bomb and leave yep i would say though if pokemon go had a battle pass i would be i would do it uh a hundred percent i mean you do play a lot of pokemon go i love pokemon go the game has proven itself to you it depends on what i'm getting for the money that i'm spending and if honestly if i can get the same thing for free by putting time in and if i really like the game i'm gonna put the time in do you not feel like the dollar research for communities are worth it though no oh they're fun except i finished them in about five minutes and then it's like once in a while i do them if i really like like i did the rosalia one sure the one aft i did well i got two we got for free because we bought the pass and then the yeah i didn't do the others and i did the garchomp one but i don't think they don't really do it like i it's like the rewards are to get more garchomp which are spawning everywhere a little story yeah you get the story you don't like the little like gibble bit i don't know what this pokemon is please find it oh it's a kibble what does it do it looks like gibble bites did you know gibbles can evolve what do they evolve into look it is a garchomp does this garchomp bite oh it bit me good job that sounds like it's worth 99.99 do you both see yourself buying let's say let's say you you you like unite you like it maybe more than pokemon go for greg because greg is always down on pokemon go i am not done yeah but he'll play pokemon masters that shows you his value system i barely play [ __ ] up my masters let's say out of all the mobile games masters magikarp jump cafe mix pokemon go you like this the most shuffle well you know shuffle is incredible would you see yourself buying cosmetics or buying characters or would you be like no cosmetics i'm not paying real money i'm gonna grind out these characters what's the thought process here so i really like let's let's take this to a real world example of that's happening now i really like final fantasy 14 and i refuse to buy cosmetics in that game you almost got divorced because of final fantasy 14. so yeah that's a real investment i mean maybe uh but like i don't you haven't brought you no no no no you bought mounts in final fantasy 14 no you have never bought by the way dollar wailord mount in that game no actually i think that was like 30 bucks uh the the eight the eight-person space whale when i saw it in game since you don't ride on top of the space whale you ride inside the space whale and all the space wheels look the same i said no the one awesome though it's fine i mean i may buy five dollars worth of butterfinger so i can get the butter finger mouth but then i'm also getting butter whoa whoa whoa whoa butterfinger is a top candy bar a butter finger no it's i need a link to this it it it's a first i feel like the thing that always brings me back to final fantasy 14 is like the dumbest thing ever it's like this is the dumbest thing it's like hey we added the whisper dude from yokai watch and i'm like i don't even care about you okay watch i'm back in though i want to be in a whisper i mean i have both whispers because you know they came out with two right yeah they have a glasses okay that amount is no that mount is no no amount is uh 100 yes no that is wow yes what is this chocolate ball thing yeah that's what it is wow it's called a chalk or pucker chalk or pocker uh-huh oh if you spend i don't like butterfinger though so you have to spend five dollars on qualifying butterfinger products and submit a photo or screenshot of your receipt using a promotional web okay okay you'd have to share it on social media yeah so okay uh butterfinger stop listening because i'll tell you what everybody's been doing so butterfinger get out of the room good thing this week we didn't have that butterfinger sponsor yeah everybody buys the butterfinger at target walks to a table takes a picture of the receipt then walks over to guest relations and turns them in for a refund greg stop what a butterfly's like two stops like it's a dollar twenty nine yep you have to butter five dollars on it you have to have a five dollar butterfinger purple but butterfinger is one of the best candy bars out there bart simpson convinced me ages ago of how delicious he's didn't he say you need to convince me you are talking to steve here who said wow steve who told me to buy a keurig to get coffee for my guests and then use it for a weekend and return it to target this is the kind of person we're doing that was that was a good strat that was a good strategy no this was the same strat i was like dominating in jungle that's what kind of strat that is okay uh the butterfinger return pro policy not too bad i would probably just give it to you like somebody i'd be like greg i guess butterfingers you're interested i mean i have to buy ten dollars for the butterfingers at this point because also butterfingers made out of peanut butter which brent can't have so i have to eat all the butter fingers no no no no butterfinger is not peanut butter whatever is inside of a butter finger is not peanut butter there's no contained peanuts though it potentially contains look i make peanuts i mean i know you contain peanuts like every candy bar in the market may contain peanuts okay what are we are we would you buy cosmetics no would you buy characters what's the what's the if if if if rosalia is a character that is only purchasable then yeah and i liked this game wow there yes i would buy that they're listening that's like they got your money if rosalia can be earned by grinding out currency grinding out currencies you wouldn't just pull the trigger and buy it you'd be like i'd play 20 hours this game not to pay like five dollars yes i am that petty they're gonna have i grind thing if i like the game then grinding out that thing isn't bad as of this moment the developer timmy of pokemon unite having heard this is now they have turned to their suite of squad of programmers and said we need four cost no grind out gems i mean it's the only way to get it rosalia statum stadium skin character skin player character stickers and mods all rosalia yeah the night because unfortunately that is the only way we will get our hands into mr leatherman's bank i will i will buy those things if i can get them no other way but if i if i love the game and i can grind it out then i'm grinding it out there's no way characters aren't paywall only like the the i can see the cosmetics like hey if you want uh surf dad garchomp you gotta pony up ten bucks but it has to be like other mobas slash games where the character i think they even said i think like you can i think they said characters was paid currency and coins or whatever the other 70 currencies in this game are will would you will you pony up money heck no what for a moba yeah much money you're in garden escapes over here you wouldn't spend five dollars on a t-shirt for your gengar no no i don't do skins i don't know not ever since that day in 2013 when i had a skin for my favorite league character and some other player text messaged me and said why do you have a skin for a character you obviously don't know how to play never again no more skins done steve did you not learn your lesson from destiny one who is your favorite league character i don't know any league character so i guess that doesn't matter yeah i mean how is that gonna help you uh did i learn my lesson from destiny one uh no no i did not i i still i still regret a lot of what happened to destiny 1 in my three years with that game i i spent a fair amount of money in final fantasy though i mean like i've been i've been subbed on and off for three years i bought the like two-person balloon mount thing that was like 20 bucks now i got that on sale that was like 15. um nope i won't do it and for our league playing listeners it was uh sona i learned my lesson in world of warcraft i did spend real money for cosmetic things and then i realized this is the dumbest thing i've spent money on yes yes i'm i don't know i don't necessarily have a problem with buying cosmetics especially if the game is like free uh like pokemon go has never really bothered me in the s like there are some hardcore pokemon go players that have probably put thousands of dollars in the game or people that put twenty dollars a week into just raid passes alone and as much as i love that game i play it in a way where like i feel like i'm pretty hardcore at pogo but i'm not hardcore where i need to get like a hundred iv you know reggie gigas or whatever is being featured this week like i like to get my four to five megas and i try to do those with my free and if somebody invites if somebody invites me i almost never declined because i'm like well you invited me and you probably already have enough people and the conveniences here i may be like i haven't spent any money on pogo this year i spent ninety nine dollars i do the hundred dollars because it's easier for my taxes i do did the 100 purchase i think in october and we're almost to june and i still have money um coins coins and i will probably spend the 100 purchase for go fest which is next month and that will probably last me to the end of the year honestly so a lot of money yes yeah i mean like okay so i i did calculate it i spent two hundred and thirty dollars i think last year in pogo um which comes to what fifteen dollars a month this morning [Laughter] but i like pogo a lot but again i know i i personally know pogo players that spend yeah like 20 a week and that's totally cool in apex legends i i i with my pogo purchase i don't think i ever felt like ugh i i'm so mad that i spent 200 in 2020 on pogo i don't think i ever felt that there was only one time in the five years of pogo where i felt actually screwed over and that was that like first egg event they did with like uh it was like kabuto omonite aerodactyl it was like the very first extravaganza and i bought a bunch of incubators and i felt completely ripped off and me and i don't even regret that because i just don't buy incubators anymore i just i think incubators are just not a fun part of the game oh i know an incubator that you'd buy i can see your office right now oh the the so in like apex legends i already said i bought seven of the eight battle passes so that's seventy dollars right and then i think i've only given the game like 50 bucks during their like two year anniversary event and i regretted that purchase i was like i'm just cool with the battle passes like the fifty dollars into ap but apex legends they charge like twenty dollars for a skin and it's like i think it's highway robbery i think like you're charging this much for a skin that like you can't even see because you're in first person and no one else cares because they're gonna kill you in like 10 seconds um but uh if the skins were cheaper i would probably actually buy them because i like that game like i would probably buy the skins for the characters that i care about so it depends with unite like if the skins for kramer ant or for el degas or for cinderacci whoever i decide i like in that game if they're like three four dollars i will probably buy them if they're ten fifteen dollars i probably won't that's absolutely much yeah which is like kind of weird because again in apex i i feel like i'm it's such a rip-off but i know people in apex that spend a lot of money on the skins and the loot boxes and it's clearly working i mean respawn has been doing it for two years i haven't lowered the price on skin so somebody is spending 20 on that kind of stuff i just think that's too expensive but i also think rocket radar is and pogo for two bucks for a rocket radar i think that's way too expensive but somebody must be buying them yeah i mean bobby with like buying characters is i don't know if i'm gonna like their playstyle i don't know if i'm gonna like how they play i don't know if i'm gonna like that role so that's why you need to watch youtube greg yeah but that's not me playing yet that's me watching somebody play it so if it's the thing that i have a problem with with characters locked behind things is when i make that purchase and i end up just not liking their play style i definitely feel ripped off or i feel like that was a terrible purchase and so i just definitely don't buy them because i don't know if i'm going to like so i don't like characters or playstyles locked behind a purchase i feel it's like where we're gonna force you to buy this and you probably gonna hate it so we just got your money and i don't i don't like that feeling in me yeah i don't know how yeah i guess we don't know how long you have to like grind out the game to buy a character for free versus well how about you know the characters and pokemon unite at all yeah we know we know skins are an issue but they said characters well you have to unlock them um so yeah i'm pretty sure cramer ansel and unlock like i don't think they give you cram around for free okay i think i think way too good to unlock they're gonna make people pay for that no yeah i think it's it i think it's if we're gonna speculate i think it's an order like those first couple pokemon are the free ones and then like alolan nine tails cramer ant when you get to the end of the list i bet those are the ones that you either have to pay for if you want them instantly or you grind out the currency but again we don't know how like in apex sorry i keep going back to apex but in apex i have so much of that currency the free currency whenever they release a character i can buy them instantly for free because i i just have so much of it so but at the beginning of apex in season one i would have had to play like 30 to 40 hours to get the two characters but since they only do one character every three months like i i have enough i have more than enough when that three months is up in the new character i have enough of that frequency so i've never had to buy a character besides like the very first week the game came out i bought mirage and then i had enough free currency to get caustic and then i've never bought a character since um so i think that's what it will probably be for for this is like you play for a little bit you unlock 2k like there's probably somebody who on day one i guarantee you there's like gonna be a handful of people on day one this game comes out they're just gonna unlock all the characters with paid money they're gonna be like i want it all and that's fine like they probably want to just try them all and feel fill out what they like because the faster you find a character you like the faster you enjoy the game i mean yeah there are people who know themselves sufficiently to know like i love mobas i love pokemon pokemon moba take my money right that's that's not us but those people do exist out there i hope i love this game the problem is you'll love it for like a month and a half it's it's it's gonna ask for too much time from you i think the the other thing it's asking is it's asking for four other people right like the game is probably gonna be more enjoyable when you're playing with certain people especially when those people are people you can have a good time with like i play apex with irene and i play apex with my friend jesse and even though we lose a lot like we still have a super good time and we're never like toxic to each other right i'm never like oh why did you do this that costed us the match like but in apex it's very fast it's a it's a battle royale so if you die right away in the first 10 seconds you just go okay we drop again right like you just get back into it i'm from everything i've heard from mobas it's like oh you play for 45 minutes and then you lose yes yes actually that actually sounds like an awful experience i mean i don't remember the one i don't even remember the one that i played i don't think it ever lasted that long was there was there a world of warcraft one uh i don't think so this is okay what we really need to be are you talking about heroes of the storm yeah here's the storm was the moba for that yeah that was it i played that maybe we need what we need to really be on the lookout for keep our ears to the ground etc which i don't know this you may guys maybe not be familiar with this but the pokemon unite version of auto chess oh i've heard of arlo chess see because that is what i could get into low commitment still access to the same characters okay what is auto chest it's basically you hmm wait i got it because you guys explained to me what advanced wars was imagine advanced wars except you set up a team of pokemon and then say all right go battle the other person's team of pokemon and then you watch what happens yeah that sounds pretty good it's kind of like chess you pick your pieces but it's auto they fight on their own i'm into that that sounds awesome set it and forget it is the life all right let's take uh one more break i think we're done with unite now uh yeah i thought we were done before and chances are you come back you go what's going on about your night i forgot uh we'll take one more break and then when we come back we got a little bit more pokemon news question of the week and pokemon a week so we will be right back hey uh what do you guys think about pumpkin spice spice pumpkin pumpkin spice frosting flakes pumpkin spices pumpkin spice mini wheat pumpkin spices pumpkin spices [Music] frosted flakes pumpkin slices we got the peppermint mocha we are back from our break two things number one is uh shout out to everyone who swung by our charity stream this past weekend we raised over four thousand dollars for trans lifeline and that was really exciting uh if you're listening to this podcast that is still opened until the end of monday so if you wanted to donate as well to our cause you're more than welcome to uh and yeah greg and i uh discussed with steve we all think that it is a very valuable organization so definitely 100 support everybody giving what they can yes so yeah we wanted to make sure we did something for pride uh and so we focused on uh a trans charity this this year and uh very happy with that choice yeah it's a good it's a good group you made good money good all around keep going yeah it was a fun stream we ended up going for eight hours we played some pokemon gale of darkness did you finally complete your hundred battles i did and that was the game i can't wait till you do it again for your next set it's gonna go we can then now move to ruby and sapphire and suffer with pokey blocks i think is the thing in that game right i feel like suffer is putting a negative spin on a fun part of the game um wait isn't blocks one of those ones where everybody contributes a little bit and then you can't get something out it's like kind of like the egg spinner and yeah problem with pokey blocks is if you mess it up you can't undo it it's like permanent kind of like a curry um uh the other thing is the other thing is apple podcasts just rolled out their subscription and i do know that 60 of our listeners listen through apple podcast it's actually kind of crazy how high that is but because we've been doing this for 11 years apple podcast was like the dominant thing for the first two um spotify wasn't a podcast provider three months three years ago so a lot of newer podcasts will probably be like heavier on spotify but because we've been around for so long our audience is very heavy on apple podcast and because i know that uh a lot of i know that it's a challenge to get people to go to our patreon page because you're listening to an audio only podcast you're probably running at the gym you're probably driving your car uh but uh we're gonna turn that on that should be on so if you want our premium feed of the two bonus episodes we do a month we've already done two this month will actually be probably a third bonus episode this month but you can get will greg and myself e3 thoughts that podcast is now up in the premium feed for both apple podcast and for the patreon premium feed and then you can get irene's and my thoughts on the first half of the season for pokemon journeys uh that was another hour episode where we talk about our favorite episodes and what we like and don't like about journeys and then you get access to the episodes that came out last month and all the bonus episodes there uh the difference is both are the the same as they're both five dollars if you subscribe an apple podcast or you subscribe on patreon the difference is uh apple doesn't share your email i don't know who you are you don't get access to the slack so if you care about the privacy end of it apple podcast um if you want to join the slack and get the other benefits that slack has to offer or sorry patreon has to offer you can join the patreon patreon.com uh but we're gonna tr where i'm gonna turn on the apple thing if like three people use it i guess that's fifteen more dollars yeah right but uh i wanna try to make it so if you want the premium podcast and you're you're already in the apple ecosystem and you want to support that way there's no reason for me not to turn it on it's just i just have to upload it to there every week so it's a little bit more work for me but if like i said if three people decide that that's where they want to support totally okay with it i'm just gonna turn that option on but if you're already on patreon don't worry about it everything's gonna be the same um so yeah speaking of iphones and mobile uh pokemon go live revamped their entire website the first time in five years their website is completely different it looks better i don't know if it is actually better but visually it looks better uh but there is some pokemon go news here reggie giggis is now in five-star raids because the summer solstice is around i don't know if that's a good enough reason for reggie case to be in raids but that's the reason niantic gave have you done your reggie gigas i've done one yeah i know you got shiny yeah yeah there it is so mad about that because okay listeners this is what you the behind the scenes that you didn't see i finally completed the genesect research yes i know i'm a year and a half late but i finally completed the genesect research and out of that i got a shiny genesect and i was like what a pleasant happy surprise i was at first i was like did everybody get a shiny genesect and steve was like no you're special will you got a shiny genesect and literally like one day later greg's like well look at me i got a shiny reggie giggis and i'm like well there you go always got it one up on me one upmanship 100 it is a competition for everybody's favorite dad where also the the frosting on top of this delicious cake is former bad boy converted to good boy sean will not dox them by their last name invited me actually i think maybe he's back back on the bad list because he invited me to a remote reggie gigas raid which i used my remote raid pass to do but he only had five people so we failed like literally like it was one of those ones where like you're running ran out the clock yeah reggie giggs had like one sliver of health then dude messages me and he's like oh i got more people okay do it again so i went in on his invite did it again he didn't have more people he lied it was five people literally the same thing happened again we didn't get the reggie giggish who did anyone met go there were no megas i eat mega man you get that fighting boost i don't think i have that yet um when is mega metagross coming i don't know what is mega salamance coming you just asked for the one two of the most popular megas are they not valid questions anyways i have a shiny regular guess and y'all don't and i got it first uh real game player right here i'm amazing true uh pokemon go fest t-shirt will be available it is available uh it is in the store unlike last year they sold out of these shirts in in in like two hours it's because those shirts were good no there's a bad red it wasn't into the am red it was like this bad like these shirts aren't good why do people have a problem with these shirts i think they're great they're too noisy what are you they're they're red blue and white that's it are you not are you blind do you not see the many things that are all over the red blue but it looks like uh like a mountain and a city and then there's this big yellow tower in the middle it's a hot it looks chaotic look you have lost all right to say what is and isn't good based off of your recent purchases i don't know what i've recently purchased myself oh this watch band is incredible oh my gosh i had to return it though i needed a smaller size i thought they measured your wrist with the special wrist measurer did use the special wrist measurer but they didn't say that these eventually like they get a little stretch after the first week they expand a little bit you break them in so then the one i got which fit perfect it expanded and then it was a little loose sounds like an ugly watch band with mechanical problems anyways the shirts are now available in pokemon center the reason that this may be important because this is how you get the professor willow's tcg card which is the collaboration between the tcg and pokemon go it's professor's research it's exactly what all the other professors do discard your hand draw seven cards the card also has a special promo code on it printed and then if you use the code you'll get special research and go where you'll be able to encounter mel tan and earn items on your journey which i get that makes sense you know mel tan is the mythical that came from go i make sense uh if you buy anything on pokemon center.com that's under the pokemon go category shirt egg incubator water bottle team mystic hat water bottles are sold out water bottle don't buy the water bottle can't if you buy any pokemon go things it will come with the card it will auto add it to your cart um water bottles are team mystic hat also sold out but if you want team valor or team instinct those hats are available there's a new go lanyard they added that's kind of cool there's the gengar beanie which is not perfect why would you wear that in the summer why not not summer everywhere true it's yeah it's true it's like winter in australia right yeah it's like they're snowed in because that's what happens i was so into the varsity i got instinct fleece varsity and then it says hoodie and i'm out oh yeah yeah the hoodies it just if it was detachable i wouldn't maybe make the pushes take the hey take the stop stop you're really hate you live in minnesota at some point you're going to be like i better put my hood up it's called a hat yeah but the hat doesn't cover the back of the net true agreed yeah a hood sucks all the cold air in as the wind hits your face and it gets that cat they're not doing it wrong they've got drawstrings buddy yeah then i'm shrinking my face and i look like a south park character it doesn't matter how you look in the winter as long as you're warm yes agreed it always matters how you look always be branding if you look like garbage people will assume your brand is good oh the abb yes ah b doof breakout shiny beedoof coming oh wait okay yes and you both can say will well was right well

tuesday wednesday uh i don't know people like dude he's cool el doofo come into your town we're getting closer and closer to go fest yep i'm pretty excited yep there's already we're talking about make the plans last night uh this is off license global.com galleries lafayette reveals pokemon 25th anniversary collection to celebrate the 25 years of pokemon galleries lafayette has launched an exclusive collection of clothing and accessories from june 8th through july 6th the gallery's lafayette champion and salah in france we'll host a pokemon pop-up yeah that that's the word please thank you they will host a pokemon pop-up the department store has been dressed entirely in the colors of pokemon the collaboration pokemon and masaye pr macaroni have created a branded box of meloeve cake in addition in a collection of marshmallows and uh coated with a chocolate shell flavors will include vanilla coffee pistachio raspberry etc and there's a whole website to it so if you're in the france area uh there's a whole department store with a bunch of pokemon stuff there's some pictures on this website they look very cool it is a very huge one of the biggest department stores in uh france they're doing something for the 25th where is mall of america doing their 25th celebration who knows do they show what the clothing is do we need to talk to my friends in france uh it takes me to their clothing website but i don't see the pokemon stuff specifically also this website is in french i it's very hard for me to navigate it i found a purse and some earrings they have a big pokeball that you can get inside and lots of pikachu balloons that's true can i type pokemon on their store website oh it did work uh okay so they're selling the levi's stuff they're selling the levi's i mean it's a mall i guess that makes sense oh here's some of it uh there's like a black and white pikachu shirt that's pretty cool oh this one's really cool this audio shows really the problem unfortunately is we don't have a lot of listeners in france because our french is poor to middling at best i mean i'm technically fluent but i haven't used it in a very long time but i have a lot of friends there so this is what i'll say about for for audio listeners is what i will say about their collection it is better than the levi's collection but that is that was a low bar yeah it is levi's collection was very 90s in style well then i get back i really like the black t-shirt with the pikachu on the back it is very cute it was like pikachu's butt right yeah yeah i like that one too i like this yellow one with a very cute shirt i would i would take that shirt in a heartbeat the the yellow one with the bunch of pikachu faces in the shoulder that one that one's very cute too yeah i like that one a lot uh the long t-shirt with the pikachu's all over is pretty cute because they're doing the electric stuff yeah i would buy some of these way to go france trapian we got some we're we'll save the booty stuff for next week yeah we have all booty booty next week booty it up there's a lot of yeah we'll booty it up next week uh question of the week greg all right question of the week i want to hear the question question of the week let's have the question [Music] ah i give you so much time and you're just like not ever ready it is i'm ready this this is from kane is that how you say it we don't know what you're looking at i'm looking at the attic channel in our slack i don't go there i don't think i'm invited how is it spelled k a k-a-y-n-e okay yeah i think it's gay kanye so sure how do you spell kanye k-a-n-y-e do you not listen to kanye i even i've heard a kanye song yeah but i don't think i've ever wrote kanye's name or tried to spell it before you haven't read a news article about mr kanye west my education model oh here we go subpar blame it on the i don't think milwaukee public school system covers anything kanye west when you were going to high school or now you'd be surprised they write in and say what is your favorite song slash track from any game or the anime it's not always black and white that was a very easy answer for me because i have one there's one pokemon song from a pokemon game that is on my uh never skip list so if it comes up in the rotation i always listen to the whole thing which is you guys don't know i i hope it's not like ends lullaby or something bad like that wow all of all of n's music low-key terrible all right here's your clue we're do it we'll have an extra pokemon of the week there is one city in pokemon black and white and i believe in black and white too as well i think they continued this particular theme i already know the song i already know where there were people dancing and as part of the dancing they have a song that they all sing together and it's the music for that city yeah i know which city it is i don't know the name of the song but it's it's the it's this it's village bridge it's actually that's what it's called what no no what wrong it's there's no people dancing at village bridge what other song would they be in black and white because in village bridge that's the one where they have like the actual words but you can't understand it no greg oh city at right before you head up the road to dragon spiral tower there's a group of people dancing in a circle and singing a song about the dragons but the music for israel city is my absolute favorite village bridge is pretty good though look you already lost okay village bridge is pretty good um i like all the trumpets in gen 3. oh uh i'm trying to think i have to look at my thing because there's a couple of so like it's it's tough because there's like songs that only appeared in like to be a master that i really really like like i love team rockets rocket and then somebody did the remax of the team rocket song that i really really like uh i i really like i really like the current journeys anime song yeah i like route 110 in gen 3 because it's the trumpiest trumpetiest of trumpets i'm trying to think of what is the one song in alola that i really really really while you think about that here's your team rockets rocking story um on when we finish recording drive check on tuesday nights uh i immediately have to give my cat his insulin because i'm already late because that's supposed to happen at 8 pm so as we did that we would start playing team rockets rockin until twitch started muting our video of the day because we were using licensed music how did yeah i was literally just putting my phone down next to the microphone uh i would say usually i'm pretty sure the the museum music is relatively the same between games um they don't change it dramatically they change some i don't i don't know music well enough to know if it's like tempo or beat or whatever but the the ocean museum music in gen 3 which is kind of similar to the museum music in gen 1 but slightly different which is kind of similar to the ssn music anyways that that track very good i like the ocean specifically the gen 3 one the ocean music ocean oceanic music museum or whatever uh and then the gym leader the gym leader music and sword and shield is incredible it gets you hype every time yeah true it's intended to yeah the crowd noises and everything yeah real hype even if even if you're one shot in all those gym leaders pokemon you're still like i'm into this the music's very good i don't remember which one it is i like i like so much of the sun and moon soundtrack it is so beachy true and is it brandon who's the guy that does all the remakes who does like the orchestra who did the orchestra remakes god oh jared no jared jewelers no your friend he did pokemon the we went reorchestrated symphonic evolution of a symphonic evolution i don't think he did the music that was braxton berks all of those remakes i love uh i have so many of them but yeah cycling round route 110 of the remakes hoe and summer love it what it's this is this is your look i know you're looking at youtube you just looked up the history city music uh jc from youtube has a huge ques and it's a really good question it's just like i see chases of insync no just jc uh but they say love the show happy pride so i'll read that part there's there's just a lot to this question and i feel like our show is already long so i we can't tackle it we're it's a very short pokemon of the week no it would take me 10 minutes to read the question no it wouldn't start here i will ask an easier question we'll see if we can go back to it we're not going to go back to it dude uh this is from this is from raymond from our youtube do you allocate money on a monthly basis to buy pokemon cards games merchandise smiley face how much smiley face smiley face no and zero i mean i spend money when i have it like i have you have to draw the line on merch right like yeah i guess well doesn't really buy merch but you got that right so like of like i generally will say like i have a hundred dollars of just like free money that i don't worry about if i spend it on things and i will spend it in various areas uh sometimes it's pokemon stuff uh but like if i know [Music] a game is coming out then i put that much money aside for that game right like i know uh diamond and pearl are coming in november so i'm gonna buy those games in november so that money is already set aside for me purchasing that um but like the hundred dollar issues slush fund goes to a lot of different things that catch my eye i mean i'm a very detailed and intensive budgeter i my budget has 75 different categories that i put money towards every month um and one of those is gaming but i after my past experiences with the pokemon tcg put zero money towards pokemon cards i did that i will not do that i've never gotten into pokemon cards magic cards i just spent 100 on yesterday but pokemon cards no vanguard cards three to four hundred dollars a month sure um but no pokemon stuff no yeah with for me with like now that my job is pokemon i i can be a little more flexible because you can write it all off on your tracks i can write stuff off but i'm still pretty conservative when it comes to like like when i when i go to pokemon center and i'm like do i need 10 more sitting cuties no i don't have any space for them um that's true and then with pokemon cards even though we we i only primarily at this point open pokemon cards on stream uh my thought process behind pokemon cards is i want just one of every elite trainer box i want one of every side box because they usually come with a promo card and then i want one booster box and that's kind of it because i'm collecting but i also because i'm trying to collect sets but i also know like at a certain point you just buy singles it's it's just not financially correct to keep buying booster boxes because you're you're not going to beat the odds um yes i love cracking packs man yeah i do like so i have to draw a line somewhere there i do like to i do tend with my budgeting to put that money towards something that i feel like will be special or more rare in the future like the 100 pokeball things that they don't they don't do anything they just like they have that touch proximity and they have that touch sensing they light up and they're metal i did a youtube video about them just showing like hey they don't really do anything but this is what they do do like if you slightly hover your hand it like lights up because it has that sense and i don't know if like i don't i don't my opinion is that i don't think that convinces anyone to spend a hundred dollars on it but i also don't know how expensive is that technology to justify the hundred dollars that like you're like not touching it but it knows you're not touching it kind of thing i don't know if that's like technology or 99 technology but i knew that that kind of stuff would sell out and that to me was really unique because i can't remember the last time they made metal pokeballs that like light up so i tried to put my money in that you're a sucker for false rarity i mean they're sold out everywhere they're whatever i mean they could always have made more yeah yeah they could have made more but i mean they could have made more of the burger king pokeball things too and at a certain point at a certain point the market runs dry right at a certain point they they go up in price because or they go down in price i mean they they have slightly gone up in price in the last couple of years just because of the resurgence of pokemon for mainstream uh sold by mu should have sold it okay i'm gonna break uh i'm gonna break uh jc's question down here um what do you think this is a lightning round so just like whatever first comes to mind answer the so the the first question they ask like four questions but the first question they ask is really good why do you think there's enormous gulf between the number of people who play pokemon and those who participate in vgc or other competition um uh toxic one uh toxic uh player environment um i i don't find pvp fun it stresses me out is the is it that despite many ways of game freak has sped up and improved the process of making a team there's still a massive time sink in learning the format yes um uh i'm in the opinion that there's no greater difficulty spice in a video game going from the pokemon campaign to multiplayer the game itself doesn't teach you anything about speed control prediction or what is actually useful you largely have to go outside the game to learn that knowledge let alone basic stuff like pokemon abilities and move pools is there a way this could be a pro improved um and then they reference like picolytics uh and then they say would it even make a difference is there just really a cold hard fact when you have an audience as large and as wide as pokemon is it always going to be the minority that gets into it um i will just be shocked if more than five percent of people even dipped in competitive which seems like a pretty dire number can vgc become mainstream or is it doomed to be a niche forever happy pride i think that's the that's true for everything the majority i mean the majority of people out there do not want to do competitive things and well you're not a game can i bring up apex legend again no like like in apex legends like there is a competitive scene right i will never be there yeah but i enjoy dropping in hopefully getting one or two kills i've i've won apex legend i like have one ranked matches of apex legends um but most of the time i don't and it feels good when i win but the barrier to entry for that game is so low you pick a character you eventually hopefully become good at that character and then you play and there's luck right there's luck of like did i pick up the good armor quickly did i pick up my favorite weapon quickly but they jc is correct there is such a huge learning curve with pokemon true i don't know how they do it better i don't i don't think they can and i don't i don't think that's bad right like so that so mmos have a huge it's a huge divide there's pvp and there's pve and you pick the lane that you're happy in and pvp tends to be a smaller lane depending on the game because it requires a very different mindset it's a very different skill set it's a very different experience and the weird thing about pokemon is you go through a pve experience that that is why most people have bought the game is for a pvp experience and then you are faced with the sudden switch to do a pvp experience which is a very daunting and not for what a lot of people signed up for and i will even tell you before you even get that far the number one thing that causes the majority of people who love playing pokemon and buy every pokemon title that comes out to not play competitive is i cannot bring my team of favorite pokemon to playerverse player yes yeah and expect to win i mean or even be competitive i mean pokemon and other things have you know meta the things that good and favorites aren't there like a lot of favorites aren't gonna aren't gonna be there and for a lot of people that isn't the the goal for competitive is to be competitive and a lot of people don't necessarily come to pokemon for that reason like the one thing that i love about pokemon is there's so many different ways to interact with it and it supports all of those ways and i don't think that competitive pvp needs to be easier it does need to be an easier point of entry i think though that like i get why there's like not a focus but why people think about this competitive is because the game the games have always had the the game is the game's always had battles right yeah you go through the whole game battling you battle eight gym leaders yes you battle the champion you you the game tells you you are the best pokemon trainer so the game gives you that confidence of being like well i'm the best pokemon trainer i can beat other trainers and you can't other trainers are better than you um but the game at least gives you that that concept and this this was like very apparent to me when i started the show when i started ise and it was like heart gold soul silver going into black and white i thought i was really good at pokemon um because in my circle of friends i was good at pokemon but in the world of pokemon i am not good uh and i have tried to get better over the years and the pokemon company has tried to make that easier to get into with like ability capsules and the hit the rare ability capsules and the bottle caps and vitamins being easier to purchase and stuff but um it's still so time consuming not only on the playing but prepping a team so like right now i'm in a draft league uh with a bunch of other content creators that's on the youtube channel and i am sure most of those creators are using a discord bot or some sort of third-party software to generate their team to play in this match and whatever i get it because i'm doing it the quote-unquote legit way and it is incredibly time consuming in a week i have to look at their team i have to try to counter their team with the 10 pokemon i have pick six of them figure out how to counter their team come up with spreads specific eevee spreads come up with a move set and then practice that team in a week and because i'm building the team in game no shade to anyone who's not i get why they're not doing it it is so time consuming and resource heavy of like yes i have these 10 pokemon cool i got to spend all i got to spend my resources to reset their stats i got to spend my money to buy more vitamins i got to calculate out the vitamins oh kingdra needs an egg move uh okay does anyone like i am very fortunate i have a discord and a slack i can go hey does anyone have a kingdra with clear smog oh cool you have a horsey with clear smog well guess what it has to be a kingdra because i need to put kingdra and kingdra in i have to delete the move i have to then hope i have to then spin in a circle to that move it is so time like to build my team in game this week took two hours i like it was built in showdown or some third-party thing in seconds i mean obviously tweak and stuff uh but it took two hours to build this team to have a couple matches and now i have to do that again and that like that building team even though it's fast two hours is very fast to build six pokemon um that doesn't include the practicing that doesn't include making sure like i am lucky that i have so much money in sword and shield and i have so many resources and sword shield because i have a thousand hours in sword and shield so like probably at the end of this 11 week tournament i will be out of resources but i can't imagine an actual person who doesn't play pokemon full time that needs to have six fully eevee iv bread pokemon every single week for a tournament like that is unreal expectations and a lot without playing so much of the game i mean again if this is your game and that's what you want then you're going to put in the time just like there are people who all they do is pvp in final fantasy 14 and i've done it literally twice to get a reward that i wanted and then i left it behind because not only is it a completely different game the controls are different like everything about it is different and you have to make that choice and then decide this is what i want to do and that is always going to be a very small amount of people well and there's also a very key psychological thing which i think everybody is susceptible to because i even thinking about this greg and i fell into this earlier in recording today just because and a lot of competitive people think this just because you really enjoy something does not necessarily mean that you're going to convince somebody else that they're going to really enjoy that you know greg and i love to play magic commander we played last night had a great time when steve moves to minneapolis we may want him to play commander with us okay but that does not mean that he will enjoy it he may not but he can at least try it once with yeah okay but but there's also a lower barriers entry there's a lower barrier competitive pokemon shield has done a very so here's the one thing about competitors right sword and shield or past pokemon games have done such a good job and this is just the nature of people playing through a pokemon game if you've played through any pokemon game whether that's red and blue let's go pikachu let's go eevee sun and moon you can watch a battle and understand it i don't have to like i could play little league football and watch nfl and understand okay they get the ball to the other end they're kicking they're throwing like like football soccer baseball you can watch it never play those actual sports irl and understand it and unlike the pokemon trading card game which is very hard to watch uh and follow the it's very easy to watch four pokemon on the field that one's water that one's fire that one's grass this one got real big did their water type move to the fire one the fire one died like it's very easy for somebody to watch and enjoy and understand the competitive battle so if anything the pokemon company has done a really good job at that whether that was intentional or not i think they also added in that you can rent teams like you can can't you still qr code somebody's team and test it out and see if you like it yeah so there is i think at this point up a very low barrier of entry to try if you like vgc like you can find somebody's team that you yes they say is very good and you can try it out that doesn't mean that you are going to like playing against another person because it is vastly different than playing against the computer all right we failed at lightning round here folks yeah so we are so long into this episode let's go to pokemon of the week i just want to say that like two quick things number one is what you guys commented on earlier it's very hard for somebody to get into competitive because they do want to use their favorite pokemon and so what will normally happen is that somebody will will they'll do the research they'll look up the evs they'll look up the best move sets they'll look at the meta they will they will spend weeks or hours or months whatever i should have said hours weeks months building a team of their favorite pokemon and then go into a battle and instantly lose and that makes them feel like the worst ever because of how much time they put in um but not understanding that like just because there's such a big disconnect between like building a team and battling and i have to explain this to people on twitch all the time where they're like uh like just because you built your team doesn't mean you're a good battler and just because you're a good battler doesn't mean you can suddenly build a team right like those are two different skill sets uh completely they just don't they just don't relate to each other at all like you can be the best battler and not know how to build the team or vice versa so that's a problem and the other problem um that i want to mention that like they said that is it reality that's just cold hard fact that you have a large audience is why is pokemon and the minority gets into it we've seen this yes we've seen this like case in point with with like r slash pokemon where when they show dreadnought for the first time in sword and shield i'll never forget this moment they showed dreadnought and they showed dreadnought gigantomaxing and they showed dreadnought's signature move which was stone surge which was a water type move that set up stealth rock and that was the most upvoted post on our slash pokemon for like the week is like game freak doesn't understand competitive because they just gave this pokemon a gigantomax move and it sets up it sets up um stealth rock when in reality the actual competitive people that understand this game in and out went this pokemon is useless uh stealth rockin doubles battles is useless but the vocal majority who doesn't understand competitive but thinks they understand competitive and this was this is what i thought i understood when i started this podcast i thought i would have probably been that person being like oh yeah gigantomax dreadnought is going to ruin the meta no one has ever used dreadnought competitively because it's just a bad pokemon and like the perception of people thinking they know competitive because they've watched stuff or they've played through the game or they've dabbled in battle tower versus the actual reality of making it to a player's cup or playing at a high level there's a huge disconnect and there's like there's like no way of getting those people to realize that until they seriously get into competitive battling and realize like oh yeah stealth rock is kind of bad in doubles yeah yep i mean i will say this i play a lot of pokemon i i build teams because they build them for fun when we even when we did fun tournaments in slack the amount of stress i feel playing against another person makes it not fun for me i get very stressed out about it um and so there are people like me that just playing against another human being is not what i'm in my games for i want it to be cooperative and we're going to play with somebody else pokemon of the week all right so this week's pokemon or last i don't know which how time works but it's the pokemon that comes after zubat it has two wings two eyes two legs four teeth its name starts with the letter g g e it's grew back it's gold duck you're obviously people like swoo bat but with the g with a d ah it's gold back let's go back no evern what is our great trivia about gold matt other than it has again a pretty good shuffle icon and also again i hate it shiny uh friendship evolution it doesn't evolve except with high friendship it's like watermelon no no no golbat doesn't require friendship it just has to get to level 22. no pull that into crow yeah go back into crobat yeah i mean crowbar's a different story i don't know growbed does look like a flying watermelon like if that's the if you wanted to imagine a flying watermelon that's that's what you're gonna get right there what a horrifying concept can we talk about how bad the gen one for crowbett is in gale of darkness and gala oh gosh in gala darkness it's a nightmare uh the the gen 1 sprite for gold that is out of control oh it's it is it is awesome truly a horror saliva coming off yeah it's it is a and they've never brought the tongue back bring back the tongue more well you know the bigger thing than national decks is that bring back is not oriented properly it's like attached it doesn't need to make sense wait there was a tongue in ruby and sapphire in that in that mouth that's not a shadow that's a tongue in there yeah maybe maybe what about next year it needs to hang out going forward sword and shield forward tongue out time tongue out wings up tongue out wings up bring well do you understand okay so uh the according to bulbapedia the only core series games to depict its tongue were pokemon red and blue and the last game to ever depict its tongue was pokemon battle revolution oh the old the dr this week's pokemon for you all we're we're raising the level again i'm trying to have faith in my kids that you'll be able to sort this one out outside of type there are other factors of a pokemon that can impact how a particular pokemon interacts with game mechanics there is only one pokemon because of a certain factor that when attacked by low kick or grass knot the attack's power is 80. receive a minus 20 modifier when trying to be caught in a heavy ball are not eligible to compete in the fancy cup are not eligible to compete in the light cup can be taken into the can listen closely can be taken into the air by the move skydrop this pokemon's evolution was pokemon of the week many years ago because at the time it was jeff's favorite pokemon there you go that's all you need to know uh just so listeners no i didn't look up the pokemon battle revolution goal bat and yeah we got some that's some good tongue action right there song action that's a real good tongue gracious all right well we will be back next week uh so thank you for listening thank you for making it to the end uh greg is that white wing on twitter will is that washing
