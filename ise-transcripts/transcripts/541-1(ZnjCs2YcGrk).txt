of the first is that that was yeah the (0:40 - 0:44)
first we're still waiting in Elvis (0:42 - 0:46)
second and definitely one L the third (0:44 - 0:49)
yeah always you love you love a third uh (0:46 - 0:51)
speaking of the third person on the show (0:49 - 0:52)
Greg (0:51 - 0:54)
broom broom listeners it's a little bit (0:52 - 0:56)
paldaya (0:54 - 0:59)
we're here what what up for the Greg (0:56 - 1:01)
every episode you gotta give us a better (0:59 - 1:04)
name than super picnic Club yeah because (1:01 - 1:07)
the bar is literally on the floor so I (1:04 - 1:08)
just have to hop over it and we're (1:07 - 1:12)
already in Golden land you failed to hop (1:08 - 1:15)
over it last week what is that I did not (1:12 - 1:18)
did not fail last week this week is is a (1:15 - 1:20)
specific reference that a very specific (1:18 - 1:23)
segment of the audience will get (1:20 - 1:23)
what I'm waiting for it I did it we're (1:25 - 1:31)
broke blisters we're a little bit Pat (1:29 - 1:33)
dead that is a very specific reference (1:31 - 1:36)
look I'm gonna get a lot of DMs (1:33 - 1:39)
that are gonna be like yes and I'd be (1:36 - 1:42)
like yeah I know I mean I like vroom (1:39 - 1:44)
vroom that's pretty good room (1:42 - 1:47)
I'm very into that okay uh so today's (1:44 - 1:49)
episode for spoiler purposes I mean you (1:47 - 1:51)
could probably tell by the episode title (1:49 - 1:54)
uh we will be talking about team star (1:51 - 1:57)
although I am confident I will probably (1:54 - 1:59)
say team flare at least three times yeah (1:57 - 2:01)
why do you do that I think just because (1:59 - 2:04)
they put such a focus on Mela and she's (2:01 - 2:05)
fire (2:04 - 2:08)
hmm I guess and she's we're all she (2:05 - 2:10)
looks like she could be in Flair yeah (2:08 - 2:12)
yeah she looks like she I don't think (2:10 - 2:14)
she could afford to be informed nobody (2:12 - 2:16)
could afford to be in player but I think (2:14 - 2:19)
she that was a whole lesson of that game (2:16 - 2:22)
is the one percenters would rather (2:19 - 2:24)
destroy the world than have to figure (2:22 - 2:27)
out how to share the resources yeah (2:24 - 2:30)
capitalism capitalism except they did a (2:27 - 2:31)
very bad job at trying to explain the (2:30 - 2:33)
story of capitalism they have a chance (2:31 - 2:35)
look that will be a theme because (2:33 - 2:37)
they're going to continue it here what (2:35 - 2:40)
okay yeah I I kind of figured out last (2:37 - 2:42)
week that uh Greg and I were gonna (2:40 - 2:45)
disagree on the the storytelling for (2:42 - 2:47)
spoiler purposes we will be talking (2:45 - 2:49)
about all of Team Flair till the very (2:47 - 2:51)
end where it says I see I said it team (2:49 - 2:54)
player uh all of teams are to the end (2:51 - 2:57)
where it says um mission complete or (2:54 - 2:59)
whatever it does I don't know I think (2:57 - 3:02)
that's what it does I think yeah it says (2:59 - 3:03)
star First Street (3:02 - 3:05)
complete something complete whatever (3:03 - 3:08)
called complete it's very obvious yeah (3:05 - 3:11)
yeah there's a big sign (3:08 - 3:14)
s your screen uh so before we get into (3:11 - 3:17)
that uh I think uh an interesting thing (3:14 - 3:19)
that Greg said after we recorded the (3:17 - 3:21)
episode I want to bring up (3:19 - 3:24)
those those those premium people know (3:21 - 3:26)
because Greg Greg talks a lot in our (3:24 - 3:29)
slack uh Greg said the words (3:26 - 3:31)
scarlet and violet has convinced me that (3:29 - 3:35)
I don't like open World Games correct (3:31 - 3:35)
so I think that was maybe uh my fault uh (3:35 - 3:41)
that we probably should have talked (3:40 - 3:43)
about the open World Games we've (3:41 - 3:44)
experienced because I think there is a (3:43 - 3:46)
distinct (3:44 - 3:48)
um I think people feel one way or (3:46 - 3:50)
another just based on if they had (3:48 - 3:52)
experience with open world games (3:50 - 3:55)
um same for mobas same for Shooters (3:52 - 3:57)
um going into something like a Destiny (3:55 - 3:59)
or a Pokemon unite or a League of (3:57 - 4:02)
Legends or uh Grand Theft Auto 5 right (3:59 - 4:04)
like there's tons of games out there (4:02 - 4:06)
and you could be like well I I've played (4:04 - 4:08)
a game like this so I'm more comfortable (4:06 - 4:10)
like this (4:08 - 4:12)
um so I guess that begs the question (4:10 - 4:15)
uh I have what what is your what is your (4:12 - 4:17)
history with open world games (4:15 - 4:21)
Greg uh this is the first open world (4:17 - 4:22)
game that I guess I've technically (4:21 - 4:23)
finished (4:22 - 4:25)
oh wow (4:23 - 4:27)
this is a really dumb question I'm super (4:25 - 4:30)
sorry if it's dumb did you play breath (4:27 - 4:31)
of the wild I only say that because (4:30 - 4:33)
literally every person under the sun (4:31 - 4:34)
played brother I don't I don't like (4:33 - 4:39)
Zelda that much so it just never like I (4:34 - 4:40)
mean she is a woman that makes sense (4:39 - 4:44)
yeah and Link is link is link is too (4:40 - 4:46)
much of a twink for my tastes (4:44 - 4:48)
um so Steve you know there's gonna be at (4:46 - 4:50)
least one person yeah listening who (4:48 - 4:52)
takes that comment seriously (4:50 - 4:58)
and bless their hearts uh so I (4:52 - 5:01)
I okay I should say technically World of (4:58 - 5:04)
Warcraft is an open world game (5:01 - 5:06)
it is technically open world I mean (5:04 - 5:08)
technically you can go anywhere as soon (5:06 - 5:10)
as you get out of here technically I've (5:08 - 5:12)
I've finished (5:10 - 5:15)
World of Warcraft up until where I was (5:12 - 5:18)
like I cannot buy another expansion no (5:15 - 5:21)
one ever finishes warlord yeah they do I (5:18 - 5:22)
mean you do you walk away from that game (5:21 - 5:24)
hardcore and I did (5:22 - 5:26)
um I never finished Shadow of the (5:24 - 5:27)
Colossus (5:26 - 5:29)
I think I got halfway I think I got down (5:27 - 5:32)
to Colossus or whatever and was like (5:29 - 5:36)
peace out I've never finished (5:32 - 5:36)
It Whatever Elder Scroll ones I played I (5:36 - 5:42)
played like three about a third of the (5:39 - 5:44)
way in and I'm like I'm bailing okay but (5:42 - 5:47)
I'm out I can't I don't like these games (5:44 - 5:49)
and (5:47 - 5:51)
I just I don't I tend not to like them (5:49 - 5:54)
and that somewhat holds true it somewhat (5:51 - 5:58)
holds true here I just don't feel (5:54 - 6:00)
what I want from a game is served in an (5:58 - 6:02)
open world setting (6:00 - 6:05)
Al what about your history (6:02 - 6:05)
played breath of the Wild (6:06 - 6:10)
yeah I love breath of the wild it was (6:08 - 6:12)
actually amazingly my first Zelda game (6:10 - 6:13)
uh I hadn't played any Zelda games (6:12 - 6:15)
before I have now gone back and played a (6:13 - 6:18)
bunch of them I did not enjoy any of the (6:15 - 6:20)
other 3D ones enjoyed a lot of the 2D (6:18 - 6:22)
ones (6:20 - 6:22)
right yeah (6:25 - 6:32)
right Ocarina of Time not fun game (6:28 - 6:33)
um maybe it would have been fun had I (6:32 - 6:36)
played it at the time but it's hard to (6:33 - 6:38)
go back and before the Wind Waker lovers (6:36 - 6:40)
come I haven't tried it yet okay so I'm (6:38 - 6:43)
not saying I'm coming for you l (6:40 - 6:46)
so I have I have I'll play it once they (6:43 - 6:48)
ported the switch (6:46 - 6:50)
um so yeah I played breath of the wild (6:48 - 6:51)
and loved it (6:50 - 6:53)
um I've tried a couple of others so I (6:51 - 6:55)
tried Skyrim and hated it but it was (6:53 - 6:56)
nothing to do with the open world (6:55 - 6:58)
aspects of it I just really didn't like (6:56 - 7:00)
the combat and movement in that game so (6:58 - 7:03)
I think um yeah I really liked I don't (7:00 - 7:05)
know with the the PS4 Spider-Man game (7:03 - 7:06)
can is an open world game it does it (7:05 - 7:08)
does I actually have a list of the 20 (7:06 - 7:11)
best open world games and it is that (7:08 - 7:13)
sounds like a fun list uh I really (7:11 - 7:15)
enjoyed that game so I think I I I'm (7:13 - 7:17)
willing to enjoy an open world game if (7:15 - 7:20)
the gameplay itself and like I don't (7:17 - 7:22)
think open world is a make or break for (7:20 - 7:25)
me like I just it's it's about the rest (7:22 - 7:28)
of the game so yeah in Spider-Man and (7:25 - 7:30)
breath of the wild the combat and the (7:28 - 7:32)
the actual game loop I really enjoyed (7:30 - 7:34)
obviously the swinging in Spider-Man in (7:32 - 7:36)
in Skyrim hated everything about it (7:34 - 7:39)
yeah so this is this is off Tom's guide (7:36 - 7:43)
I mean I I there's a bunch Tom who's Tom (7:39 - 7:46)
I know yeah Tom you know Tom Tom has a (7:43 - 7:48)
lot of guides and nobody talks about who (7:46 - 7:51)
Tom is uh this is just 20 best open (7:48 - 7:52)
World Games as a public published in (7:51 - 7:55)
August uh I I pulled up like three of (7:52 - 7:57)
these almost all the games are pretty (7:55 - 7:59)
similar Tom Tom's guides just had less (7:57 - 8:01)
ads on their website uh they got the (7:59 - 8:02)
Assassin's Creed series specifically oh (8:01 - 8:05)
I played one of those I did Black Flag (8:02 - 8:09)
uh Batman Arkham City Death stranding (8:05 - 8:11)
Dragon Age they're specifically (8:09 - 8:14)
mentioning Inquisition Eldon ring I (8:11 - 8:16)
played that one uh the Elder Scrolls (8:14 - 8:19)
they're mentioning Skyrim uh fallout (8:16 - 8:20)
series they're mentioning Fallout 4. (8:19 - 8:23)
obviously following three with them (8:20 - 8:25)
qualify Far Cry they're mentioning Far (8:23 - 8:27)
Cry 6 although I think the first two far (8:25 - 8:28)
crys were not open world I think they (8:27 - 8:31)
changed in three uh for Forza Horizon (8:28 - 8:33)
five technically that is an open world (8:31 - 8:36)
game with your cars uh ghost of uh (8:33 - 8:39)
tsushima uh bro I saw that one Grand (8:36 - 8:40)
Theft Auto (8:39 - 8:42)
um I think technically three is when it (8:40 - 8:44)
became open world but they're mentioning (8:42 - 8:47)
Grand Theft Auto 5 uh Horizon forbidden (8:44 - 8:49)
West Legend of Zelda breath of the wild (8:47 - 8:52)
Mad Max Marvel Spider-Man Middle Earth (8:49 - 8:55)
Shadow of Mordor Red Dead Redemption 2 (8:52 - 8:59)
Saints Row 4 wow The Witcher 3 wild Hunt (8:55 - 9:02)
and the Yakuza series they're mentioning (8:59 - 9:04)
Yakuza zero (9:02 - 9:06)
um a game that I'm thinking of that I (9:04 - 9:07)
I've played not on the list is the (9:06 - 9:09)
infamous series (9:07 - 9:09)
[Music] (9:09 - 9:11)
um (9:09 - 9:13)
the funny thing of it made by the people (9:11 - 9:15)
who made Sly Cooper it was either you (9:13 - 9:16)
could be a good superhero or a bad (9:15 - 9:18)
superhero oh I played halfway through (9:16 - 9:21)
that and I quit that one too oh I liked (9:18 - 9:23)
infamous (9:21 - 9:23)
I think this is the interesting thing (9:24 - 9:27)
about the term open world because it's (9:25 - 9:29)
not a genre it's like it's just one (9:27 - 9:32)
aspect of a game like those games are so (9:29 - 9:34)
different you've got a racing game a (9:32 - 9:36)
shooter uh a bunch of (9:34 - 9:39)
um uh I guess action adventure and (9:36 - 9:41)
exploration type games like they're all (9:39 - 9:44)
so different so like yeah I think my (9:41 - 9:47)
point is just like yeah I I don't think (9:44 - 9:50)
I hate or love open world as a concept (9:47 - 9:53)
it's just part of a game right yeah I (9:50 - 9:55)
there's there's an open world game not (9:53 - 9:58)
mentioned which was Final Fantasy uh 15 (9:55 - 10:01)
um which I I Adore that game uh that (9:58 - 10:03)
game has really bad storytelling you (10:01 - 10:05)
have to literally watch a 90 minute (10:03 - 10:07)
movie to like get the first part of that (10:05 - 10:08)
story before you start the game but like (10:07 - 10:10)
yeah they're still awesome yeah there's (10:08 - 10:12)
still parts of that game I really really (10:10 - 10:14)
like but that game is open world and I (10:12 - 10:16)
almost fell off it I almost you know you (10:14 - 10:17)
know was like I'm not going to come back (10:16 - 10:19)
to this because I was trying to explore (10:17 - 10:22)
the open worldness of that game and then (10:19 - 10:24)
quickly realized after three hours that (10:22 - 10:27)
there there's nothing to explore like I (10:24 - 10:29)
a thing that I remember is going out and (10:27 - 10:32)
like walking an hour in a direction and (10:29 - 10:33)
then finding this amulet and fighting (10:32 - 10:35)
this big creature and then walking an (10:33 - 10:36)
hour back because there was like no fast (10:35 - 10:38)
travel unlocked (10:36 - 10:40)
um and when I got back I was like cool (10:38 - 10:42)
at least I got this really cool amulet (10:40 - 10:44)
like great great I can equip this on (10:42 - 10:46)
noctis or whoever and then I got to the (10:44 - 10:48)
store and then I checked and it was just (10:46 - 10:49)
being sold in the store for the same (10:48 - 10:51)
like really cheap and I was like what (10:49 - 10:55)
was the point of me exploring to get (10:51 - 10:58)
something if I could have just bought it (10:55 - 11:00)
um and so when I ended up playing that (10:58 - 11:03)
game linear of just like permission to (11:00 - 11:05)
Mission to Mission I really enjoyed that (11:03 - 11:07)
game so the open world was a very weak (11:05 - 11:09)
part of that game (11:07 - 11:11)
um so yeah I was just curious what your (11:09 - 11:12)
guys's history of the open world was (11:11 - 11:15)
because I think you know what I was (11:12 - 11:18)
referring to last week with a map in in (11:15 - 11:19)
a lot of open World Games you just go to (11:18 - 11:21)
the map so often of like where where can (11:19 - 11:25)
I go next uh what can I do next (11:21 - 11:27)
um and so for me that like looking at (11:25 - 11:28)
the map and being like oh this person is (11:27 - 11:30)
supposed to be hard this person's (11:28 - 11:31)
supposed to be easy that that came (11:30 - 11:33)
natural to me (11:31 - 11:35)
um and I even had a situation where (11:33 - 11:37)
somebody my twitch chat was like I I (11:35 - 11:39)
don't understand how the marker works (11:37 - 11:40)
like I've never played an open world (11:39 - 11:42)
game and I was like oh as long as the (11:40 - 11:44)
little flag is on the top of your (11:42 - 11:47)
mini-map go that way just make sure the (11:44 - 11:49)
top of the flag is always up and you (11:47 - 11:51)
will make it to your and they were like (11:49 - 11:52)
oh my gosh like (11:51 - 11:54)
I've never played an open world game (11:52 - 11:56)
like as soon as you said that like now I (11:54 - 11:58)
know exactly how to get to the the (11:56 - 12:00)
marker which is I mean some people (11:58 - 12:04)
listening to me like well duh but just (12:00 - 12:06)
like Pokemon unite was somebody's first (12:04 - 12:09)
MOBA uh this is a lot of people's first (12:06 - 12:12)
open world game and to you know (12:09 - 12:14)
some of those people got that experience (12:12 - 12:17)
in Zelda but if you didn't play Zelda (12:14 - 12:19)
you yeah (12:17 - 12:23)
Zelda Zelda did it in a slightly well (12:19 - 12:24)
you can say better or what better for (12:23 - 12:27)
new people way and that it wasn't just a (12:24 - 12:29)
market on your map I think it also (12:27 - 12:31)
showed you like a glowing kind of column (12:29 - 12:32)
in the air (12:31 - 12:34)
um so like it was I think Zelda was my (12:32 - 12:38)
first oh yeah I did so if you were if (12:34 - 12:39)
you'd marked on the map you could just (12:38 - 12:40)
like spin around and look and see oh (12:39 - 12:42)
it's over there and you didn't have to (12:40 - 12:43)
use the map for that which was really (12:42 - 12:45)
nice I'm not saying necessarily they (12:43 - 12:46)
should do that I think it's something (12:45 - 12:48)
that they presumably discussed and (12:46 - 12:50)
thought about I don't think they could (12:48 - 12:52)
do it because the drugs since the game (12:50 - 12:55)
is so fast (12:52 - 12:57)
fair fair they're like yeah I'm not (12:55 - 12:59)
willing to say like maybe it's their (12:57 - 13:00)
house (12:59 - 13:04)
you just can't see it I'm never able to (13:00 - 13:05)
see it yeah (13:04 - 13:06)
um but that's that that's an example of (13:05 - 13:08)
like you know it was my first open world (13:06 - 13:10)
game but I got that nice and easily (13:08 - 13:11)
because obviously you can see that (13:10 - 13:13)
physically that's not something you need (13:11 - 13:15)
to learn it's just there physically (13:13 - 13:18)
yeah I mean I learned from Warcraft like (13:15 - 13:21)
the first house of Warcraft you could (13:18 - 13:23)
say I take this Quest it never gave you (13:21 - 13:26)
a marker you had to add on an additional (13:23 - 13:28)
add-on into World of Warcraft to (13:26 - 13:30)
actually show a marker so you knew how (13:28 - 13:32)
to get there otherwise it was like sorry (13:30 - 13:34)
kid you're on your own and so I think my (13:32 - 13:36)
first experiences really were just like (13:34 - 13:39)
the maps are useless just figure it out (13:36 - 13:42)
because they're not gonna help you and I (13:39 - 13:43)
I mean I broke that a lot because I (13:42 - 13:46)
would put markers on the map uh but I (13:43 - 13:48)
would just pop on and click it and go (13:46 - 13:51)
because the map itself isn't necessarily (13:48 - 13:55)
to scale and then my first half half an (13:51 - 13:56)
hour of finally figuring out that the (13:55 - 13:58)
big map also would spin before I figured (13:56 - 14:00)
out how to lock it I was like this thing (13:58 - 14:01)
is useless (14:00 - 14:05)
yeah it never aligns it never shows it's (14:01 - 14:06)
I'm just gonna go (14:05 - 14:08)
and on the mini map is going to show me (14:06 - 14:10)
where my marker is and that's that is (14:08 - 14:12)
the only thing I need because everything (14:10 - 14:14)
else doesn't work right (14:12 - 14:15)
I'm pretty sure I felt that way in Final (14:14 - 14:17)
Fantasy 14 I think I always had some (14:15 - 14:20)
sort of guide up next to me because I (14:17 - 14:21)
was like (14:20 - 14:24)
none of this is super clear on this map (14:21 - 14:26)
and I'm sure it's better now oh it's way (14:24 - 14:28)
better now I'm sure you're beginning (14:26 - 14:31)
also I mean Final fantas 14 brought in (14:28 - 14:33)
to start comparison what I prefer in my (14:31 - 14:36)
games is I prefer open area like Arceus (14:33 - 14:39)
where they can develop a story and a (14:36 - 14:42)
very specific story for that area and (14:39 - 14:44)
highly develop it and highly think about (14:42 - 14:47)
that area without bleed over and it's a (14:44 - 14:49)
very clear delineator like I don't care (14:47 - 14:51)
that when I'm walking across a bridge it (14:49 - 14:53)
goes black and then loads up a new area (14:51 - 14:56)
like that's preferable because I'm going (14:53 - 14:58)
to a new story beat whereas with open (14:56 - 14:59)
world is like the story beats could (14:58 - 15:01)
happen at any time (14:59 - 15:05)
and I feel I feel in general with this (15:01 - 15:07)
game and a lot of times I've played open (15:05 - 15:09)
world that the story is underdeveloped (15:07 - 15:14)
because it could happen at any time yeah (15:09 - 15:15)
I think that was definitely considered (15:14 - 15:17)
by a lot of people the the one weakest (15:15 - 15:19)
bit of breath of the wild for example (15:17 - 15:21)
was because the storyline had to happen (15:19 - 15:24)
in in any order in fact you could you (15:21 - 15:25)
could literally go to the end boss so (15:24 - 15:27)
yeah it had you know that had to make (15:25 - 15:30)
sense without doing the rest of it (15:27 - 15:31)
um and that's a really difficult problem (15:30 - 15:32)
to solve (15:31 - 15:35)
um I'm sure it could be solved but that (15:32 - 15:36)
yeah (15:35 - 15:39)
yeah I do think that sorry (15:36 - 15:41)
oh no I didn't want to enter I was just (15:39 - 15:44)
gonna say I do think that they did think (15:41 - 15:47)
about that in yeah um scarlet and violet (15:44 - 15:49)
because uh you will get different (15:47 - 15:53)
cutscene the cut scene starts before the (15:49 - 15:56)
team star interaction yeah (15:53 - 15:59)
um so you know if you ended up going to (15:56 - 16:02)
Mela first you would get the first cut (15:59 - 16:04)
scene to start that story but if you (16:02 - 16:05)
ended up going to Mela third you would (16:04 - 16:08)
get whatever the third supposed cutscene (16:05 - 16:11)
was yeah I I I know they thought about (16:08 - 16:12)
it because you get the minarder I'm just (16:11 - 16:15)
saying because it can happen in any (16:12 - 16:17)
order they had to keep it pretty pretty (16:15 - 16:20)
light like it's the story plot lights (16:17 - 16:22)
are pretty light on on a lot of the (16:20 - 16:24)
things that they cover like because they (16:22 - 16:25)
could happen at any time that could (16:24 - 16:28)
happen in the order they kind of feel a (16:25 - 16:32)
little more generic to me then like here (16:28 - 16:34)
is a very deep lore about this very (16:32 - 16:36)
specific region because we know you're (16:34 - 16:38)
here at this exact time at this exact (16:36 - 16:40)
time in the story and we can explore (16:38 - 16:43)
that deeper (16:40 - 16:43)
yeah I'm actually not sure whether (16:43 - 16:47)
that's because it's an open world game (16:45 - 16:49)
though like I think that's because it's (16:47 - 16:53)
Pokemon and primarily like obviously I (16:49 - 16:55)
think you know primarily Pokemon games (16:53 - 16:58)
are meant for all ages and so you're (16:55 - 17:00)
never going to get really (16:58 - 17:02)
I I mean I would argue we're obviously (17:00 - 17:03)
not going to talk about the the last bit (17:02 - 17:05)
of story but like I think there's a lot (17:03 - 17:09)
in this overall story that is (17:05 - 17:11)
something I wouldn't have expected in a (17:09 - 17:13)
Pokemon game yeah yes (17:11 - 17:15)
hmm (17:13 - 17:17)
I I'm not saying it's the most deep and (17:15 - 17:19)
interesting story I've ever done but I (17:17 - 17:22)
think it's more it's it has more depth (17:19 - 17:25)
than most Pokemon games uh (17:22 - 17:28)
yeah no I I agree with Al on that point (17:25 - 17:29)
um (17:28 - 17:34)
but to focus on the team star stuff uh (17:29 - 17:37)
did we go in you know quote unquote (17:34 - 17:40)
order or who was your guys's first team (17:37 - 17:43)
star and who's your last (17:40 - 17:46)
my first was (17:43 - 17:49)
go ahead my first was mailer because I (17:46 - 17:51)
did that kind of in the I went over to (17:49 - 17:54)
do the first Titan and thought I was was (17:51 - 17:56)
doing the first uh Team start as well (17:54 - 17:58)
quite struggled but managed to get there (17:56 - 17:59)
and then I did the rest of them in order (17:58 - 18:01)
so I did like two one three five four (17:59 - 18:06)
five oh okay my first was (18:01 - 18:09)
the DJ whatever his name is because I (18:06 - 18:11)
was trying to get to the water (18:09 - 18:12)
Jim (18:11 - 18:16)
and they are in the way so that was my (18:12 - 18:17)
first (18:16 - 18:21)
and then I did Mela (18:17 - 18:21)
then I did Atticus (18:23 - 18:28)
is that the poison yeah and then yeah (18:26 - 18:30)
then I did the poison Ortega and then (18:28 - 18:33)
Eerie or the last then I did then I did (18:30 - 18:38)
Ortega chips and then I did Ireland (18:33 - 18:38)
um yeah so I I missed uh (18:40 - 18:45)
I don't know how to say his name I'm (18:43 - 18:50)
super sorry it's a Gaia Como Gia Giacomo (18:45 - 18:53)
um he's the DJ I think I'll be your como (18:50 - 18:54)
yeah (18:53 - 18:58)
um and so the the order is Giacomo Mela (18:54 - 19:01)
Atticus or ortiga and then Eerie that is (18:58 - 19:03)
the order um and going back to the the (19:01 - 19:05)
the map conversation we had last week if (19:03 - 19:08)
you if you hover above the the icons (19:05 - 19:11)
it'll it'll say Eerie is it says like (19:08 - 19:15)
the strongest team star boss (19:11 - 19:18)
um and then uh or ortiga says something (19:15 - 19:19)
like (19:18 - 19:21)
um an extremely powerful team star boss (19:19 - 19:24)
uh and then (19:21 - 19:27)
um I think uh Giacomo is like the the (19:24 - 19:32)
the least skillful team start it does it (19:27 - 19:34)
does say that yeah they say that but (19:32 - 19:37)
they don't exactly give you references (19:34 - 19:39)
in comparison to what until you do one (19:37 - 19:42)
you don't have a comparison to like the (19:39 - 19:45)
hardest means what (19:42 - 19:48)
the hardest of a bunch of very easy (19:45 - 19:50)
people the hardness of a bunch of very (19:48 - 19:52)
hard people like I think it's a rough (19:50 - 19:54)
order (19:52 - 19:56)
um but I I would say when I first read (19:54 - 19:59)
it I was like okay in comparison to (19:56 - 20:00)
each other (19:59 - 20:03)
I'm assuming but they don't really (20:00 - 20:06)
give that detail I think they do and the (20:03 - 20:08)
reason that's why I asked the open world (20:06 - 20:10)
question at the beginning is because if (20:08 - 20:12)
if you if you hovered over let's let's (20:10 - 20:13)
say you just started your journey you (20:12 - 20:15)
you just get you get you get out of the (20:13 - 20:16)
school and you're like I want to do the (20:15 - 20:18)
hardest thing right away which you can (20:16 - 20:19)
do in breath of the wild that is go to (20:18 - 20:22)
the castle and defeat Ganon (20:19 - 20:24)
um you if you hover over and it says (20:22 - 20:26)
that oh Erie is the strongest you can go (20:24 - 20:28)
I want to go there when you go there uh (20:26 - 20:32)
all the Pokemon in that area are are 50. (20:28 - 20:34)
and so you you know what Erie is going (20:32 - 20:35)
to be and I think that was something we (20:34 - 20:37)
didn't talk about last week is like you (20:35 - 20:39)
can look at the map and you can go (20:37 - 20:40)
um (20:39 - 20:42)
okay well it says Ortega is a really (20:40 - 20:44)
hard team star boss and go up there and (20:42 - 20:46)
all the Pokemon in that area are 48 uh (20:44 - 20:49)
47 and you can decide at that point (20:46 - 20:50)
whether you want to be there or not like (20:49 - 20:53)
if you go over to the water area and I (20:50 - 20:55)
think I think (20:53 - 20:56)
um I don't remember his name but he has (20:55 - 21:00)
like two unibrows uh (20:56 - 21:00)
his Pokemon I believe are 28 29 and 30. (21:02 - 21:08)
um and the Pokemon in that area are (21:06 - 21:11)
about 26 and 27. so like the Pokemon in (21:08 - 21:13)
the area do (21:11 - 21:15)
signify (21:13 - 21:17)
yeah when you get there I'm saying that (21:15 - 21:19)
when you first open the map and look at (21:17 - 21:21)
it and if you're if you're in the (21:19 - 21:23)
opening area that's five six and seven (21:21 - 21:27)
it's not really giving you (21:23 - 21:28)
like for people who who play the game (21:27 - 21:30)
like I don't want to go over level cap (21:28 - 21:34)
it's like that statement alone doesn't (21:30 - 21:37)
give you an idea of what the levels are (21:34 - 21:41)
until you get there so it's not like (21:37 - 21:43)
oh it's by this gym leader because the (21:41 - 21:45)
you would assume the gym leader might (21:43 - 21:47)
say what levels they are but it's not (21:45 - 21:49)
it's the area and the area doesn't tell (21:47 - 21:52)
you on the map until you get there so I (21:49 - 21:55)
think one of the things that I saw when (21:52 - 21:57)
I was reading I'm like I get that but I (21:55 - 21:59)
don't know what you are comparing that (21:57 - 22:00)
to (21:59 - 22:03)
I don't know how these comparisons are (22:00 - 22:05)
being made is it gym leader is it area (22:03 - 22:08)
because it's a very open-ended statement (22:05 - 22:10)
and that's my only thing about it is (22:08 - 22:12)
it's helpful it's a guy point but until (22:10 - 22:14)
you get there you don't really know what (22:12 - 22:15)
that means (22:14 - 22:17)
yeah and I think that's what I was (22:15 - 22:18)
trying to argue last week is that that's (22:17 - 22:21)
like intentional yeah (22:18 - 22:23)
yeah they the the and I go back to like (22:21 - 22:26)
Bombardier being on one side and cloth (22:23 - 22:28)
being on the other like they that that's (22:26 - 22:30)
intentional as they want you to walk (22:28 - 22:32)
there and and be like (22:30 - 22:34)
do I stumble upon this the the opposite (22:32 - 22:36)
is like Final Fantasy 15 where it's like (22:34 - 22:38)
we'll go out and explore and you go out (22:36 - 22:39)
and explore and you go like well I came (22:38 - 22:41)
back with nothing (22:39 - 22:43)
where this is like if you if you go to (22:41 - 22:45)
explore Erie right away and you get up (22:43 - 22:47)
there and you're like I I can't do this (22:45 - 22:49)
you know at least now you at least have (22:47 - 22:52)
a frame of reference of what's there (22:49 - 22:55)
um versus other things (22:52 - 22:58)
so I feel like the um I mean I was I was (22:55 - 23:00)
convinced I wasn't going to start (22:58 - 23:01)
discussing this again in this episode (23:00 - 23:03)
because I'm sure we've discussed it to (23:01 - 23:05)
death and uh the slack is touring me to (23:03 - 23:08)
bits over this but so I think that (23:05 - 23:11)
if you want to encourage that (23:08 - 23:13)
exploration of go to this one on the (23:11 - 23:15)
right and then go to this one on the (23:13 - 23:16)
left and then go to this one on the (23:15 - 23:17)
right which is clearly what they want (23:16 - 23:19)
you to do (23:17 - 23:21)
well I don't think they want you to do (23:19 - 23:23)
that specifically I think they just want (23:21 - 23:25)
you to explore (23:23 - 23:28)
yeah well I mean but if you okay right (23:25 - 23:30)
fine sure (23:28 - 23:33)
surely then a quest log with them in (23:30 - 23:34)
that order would encourage that (23:33 - 23:36)
exploration because you'd go to the (23:34 - 23:38)
first one on the list and that would be (23:36 - 23:40)
on the left and then you go to the (23:38 - 23:41)
second one on the list and that would be (23:40 - 23:43)
on the right and like you would if if (23:41 - 23:45)
you're if you're going for that like oh (23:43 - 23:48)
I want to just I want we want people to (23:45 - 23:50)
kind of just explore the map and and (23:48 - 23:52)
come across the kind of this this kind (23:50 - 23:54)
of sweeping area even if you don't do it (23:52 - 23:55)
exactly like most people are going to (23:54 - 23:57)
look at a list that are given and go (23:55 - 23:59)
I'll do them in that order and that's (23:57 - 24:01)
you know some people were using that as (23:59 - 24:03)
an argument to say that's a bad idea (24:01 - 24:05)
um I agree with that (24:03 - 24:07)
I just I strongly disagree with that (24:05 - 24:11)
because like I don't understand the idea (24:07 - 24:13)
of like if people are follow if people (24:11 - 24:15)
will automatically follow a list surely (24:13 - 24:17)
that means they want the list and then (24:15 - 24:18)
we're going well then we're not going to (24:17 - 24:20)
give people that because we want them to (24:18 - 24:22)
what come up with that list themselves (24:20 - 24:25)
yes it just it's (24:22 - 24:27)
just I don't I don't I don't understand (24:25 - 24:30)
that so I I think I think here's a (24:27 - 24:31)
really good example to compare this to (24:30 - 24:33)
and I think I think this is relatable to (24:31 - 24:35)
people so (24:33 - 24:38)
in an open world game in even even in (24:35 - 24:40)
something in Elden ring what they do (24:38 - 24:41)
because they don't give you a list in (24:40 - 24:43)
Elden ring either and that was a huge (24:41 - 24:45)
complaint because like Elden ring was a (24:43 - 24:46)
lot of people's first open world game (24:45 - 24:48)
too right because Alden ring got amazing (24:46 - 24:51)
reviews it sold really well people were (24:48 - 24:52)
like I wanna I wanna get into the Dark (24:51 - 24:54)
Soul series like if you were to get into (24:52 - 24:56)
the Dark Souls series Elden ring is it (24:54 - 24:59)
right like Elden ring is the breath of (24:56 - 25:01)
the wild of that genre (24:59 - 25:04)
um by far and so what Eldon ring does is (25:01 - 25:06)
when you when you hit one of the save (25:04 - 25:07)
points it gives you like this little (25:06 - 25:10)
faint arrow in a direction and that's it (25:07 - 25:13)
it's either up left right or or south (25:10 - 25:16)
and when you start expanding the map you (25:13 - 25:18)
see the arrows will start to like give (25:16 - 25:21)
you this way to go but it's not very (25:18 - 25:22)
clear until you open up and explore a (25:21 - 25:24)
lot of the map and it's not when you do (25:22 - 25:28)
something it's just when you explore it (25:24 - 25:29)
gives you a general direction of where (25:28 - 25:32)
to move in story wise (25:29 - 25:34)
um and so going back to Pokemon I think (25:32 - 25:37)
that if you give a list list you you (25:34 - 25:40)
tend to put people in a way of where (25:37 - 25:41)
they're like I'm going to follow the (25:40 - 25:43)
list I'm not going to explore and I I (25:41 - 25:46)
will say I think if you're lost I do (25:43 - 25:48)
think still Nurse Joy I think we're all (25:46 - 25:50)
in agreement Nurse Joy should tell you (25:48 - 25:52)
who is like the weakest that you made a (25:50 - 25:54)
skip yes next I think that solves almost (25:52 - 25:58)
all these problems but (25:54 - 26:00)
um so to compare why a list isn't good (25:58 - 26:04)
if you were in a Pokemon battle (26:00 - 26:09)
and they told you their move sets you (26:04 - 26:12)
would battle differently (26:09 - 26:12)
because you wouldn't know what they have (26:12 - 26:20)
right so like if if I (26:16 - 26:24)
if I approach an impotent for the first (26:20 - 26:26)
time in sword and shield (26:24 - 26:31)
and I didn't know it was very dark (26:26 - 26:33)
and I went to use psychic (26:31 - 26:35)
it wouldn't work but if I knew it was (26:33 - 26:38)
very dark I wouldn't use psychic (26:35 - 26:41)
therefore my experience would be (26:38 - 26:44)
different if I if I knew (26:41 - 26:47)
that is that fun though (26:44 - 26:49)
I think that I think a sense of (26:47 - 26:51)
Discovery is fun that's why that's why I (26:49 - 26:54)
mean so we're kind of dancing around the (26:51 - 26:56)
fact that there are (26:54 - 26:59)
four types generally four types of (26:56 - 27:00)
gamers (26:59 - 27:04)
and one of them is explorers and not (27:00 - 27:06)
every type of gamer is explorers not (27:04 - 27:08)
every every type of gamer loves the (27:06 - 27:11)
exploration not every type of gamer (27:08 - 27:12)
finds (27:11 - 27:16)
like super contentment in Exploration (27:12 - 27:19)
and so I think to Al's Point having an (27:16 - 27:23)
option for people who aren't explorers (27:19 - 27:26)
isn't a bad thing like if it's optional (27:23 - 27:29)
but I think what like Elden ring and (27:26 - 27:32)
what this does is it it forces the (27:29 - 27:35)
Explorer experience on people who may (27:32 - 27:37)
not be Explorer Gamers and I I'm not (27:35 - 27:39)
saying that I'm not saying that everyone (27:37 - 27:42)
should be Explorer I am just saying that (27:39 - 27:44)
once that information is conveyed to you (27:42 - 27:46)
you cannot you cannot just put it out of (27:44 - 27:50)
your mind once you know that a fire type (27:46 - 27:52)
Pokemon is weak to rock and you know (27:50 - 27:54)
that as a fire type Pokemon you just (27:52 - 27:56)
can't forget that that is why people who (27:54 - 27:58)
play their second or their third Pokemon (27:56 - 28:01)
game they go like this is easier we've (27:58 - 28:02)
already learned (28:01 - 28:04)
you've already you've already learned (28:02 - 28:06)
the type chart if you were battling an (28:04 - 28:10)
elite four member and you knew that they (28:06 - 28:13)
had extreme speed and you had 10 HP left (28:10 - 28:17)
you would make a different decision than (28:13 - 28:19)
if you didn't know they had extreme (28:17 - 28:22)
speed so if there is a list of poke if (28:19 - 28:24)
there's a list of what you should do (28:22 - 28:27)
that would influence your decision and (28:24 - 28:29)
I'm not to be fair I'm not saying that (28:27 - 28:30)
that is good or bad I'm just saying that (28:29 - 28:34)
it is it would in fact influence your (28:30 - 28:37)
decision it could how how prevalent it (28:34 - 28:40)
is in the game like having an option (28:37 - 28:43)
there that you don't have to look at (28:40 - 28:45)
that is your choice to look but also we (28:43 - 28:48)
sort of ignore that (28:45 - 28:52)
for a huge part of people knowing that (28:48 - 28:53)
information (28:52 - 28:57)
enhances their experience right like (28:53 - 28:59)
there are a number of people in the (28:57 - 29:01)
world that don't enjoy that level of (28:59 - 29:04)
frustration that find that level of (29:01 - 29:05)
frustration (29:04 - 29:08)
off-putting which is which is me in a (29:05 - 29:10)
lot of ways I don't tend to finish open (29:08 - 29:12)
world games because there's a level of (29:10 - 29:14)
frustration that I'm like I'm not here (29:12 - 29:17)
to be frustrated I'm here to just have (29:14 - 29:21)
fun and this isn't fun for me (29:17 - 29:24)
and so to go back to the move example (29:21 - 29:26)
why are the moves hidden why do you just (29:24 - 29:28)
not know the opponent's moves (29:26 - 29:29)
well but it's not the same thing though (29:28 - 29:31)
this is this is this is this is the (29:29 - 29:33)
thing right like I don't think that (29:31 - 29:36)
knowing how knowing what a Pokemon does (29:33 - 29:38)
is the same as (29:36 - 29:41)
knowing the list of that like the the (29:38 - 29:44)
order the level order of of how (29:41 - 29:46)
difficult these things would be and (29:44 - 29:47)
obviously you know these difficulties (29:46 - 29:49)
like is not necessarily linear like that (29:47 - 29:52)
anyway because like I'm sure we'll talk (29:49 - 29:55)
about this I found the team star ones (29:52 - 29:57)
more difficult than the gyms and the yes (29:55 - 29:58)
the Titans (29:57 - 30:00)
and so difficulty isn't quite that (29:58 - 30:04)
simple but having that vague order of (30:00 - 30:06)
things that you can do which if you do (30:04 - 30:08)
them in that order you're probably going (30:06 - 30:11)
to have the uh most consistent (30:08 - 30:13)
experience I don't think it's the same (30:11 - 30:15)
as what I understand what you're saying (30:13 - 30:18)
and to and to go back to the the Elden (30:15 - 30:20)
ring point (30:18 - 30:21)
so I was one of those people who like (30:20 - 30:23)
when I first heard about Dark Souls (30:21 - 30:24)
games I was like oh they sound really (30:23 - 30:26)
not fun like (30:24 - 30:30)
yeah I am 100 never gonna play those (30:26 - 30:31)
games but I'm not going to ask those (30:30 - 30:34)
games to do something that that to (30:31 - 30:35)
encourage me to play them because I just (30:34 - 30:37)
don't care I know that I'm not going to (30:35 - 30:39)
enjoy them absolutely and and that's (30:37 - 30:41)
fine I'm glad that those games exist for (30:39 - 30:43)
those people who like them I don't want (30:41 - 30:45)
Pokemon to become like an Elden ring (30:43 - 30:48)
like it's not like I don't want us to (30:45 - 30:51)
say no to what I consider quality of (30:48 - 30:52)
life improvements (30:51 - 30:56)
for this idea of exploration that can be (30:52 - 30:59)
that can still be a thing for people I (30:56 - 31:00)
think this is the thing like (30:59 - 31:03)
what some people might be thinking oh I (31:00 - 31:04)
don't want the list shoved in my face (31:03 - 31:06)
that's fine I'm not suggesting that you (31:04 - 31:10)
know I'm suggesting an optional list a (31:06 - 31:12)
list that you can look at if you wish to (31:10 - 31:14)
look at and you can ignore it if you (31:12 - 31:15)
want to ignore it like there are so many (31:14 - 31:18)
other things like you know (31:15 - 31:20)
um (31:18 - 31:23)
just in games in general that you don't (31:20 - 31:24)
have to look at them like if you take (31:23 - 31:26)
like breath of the wild it had a list of (31:24 - 31:28)
of the quests that if you did them in (31:26 - 31:29)
the order that it was given would (31:28 - 31:32)
generally get you through things in some (31:29 - 31:34)
rough level of difficulty it wasn't (31:32 - 31:35)
obviously exact because it's not the (31:34 - 31:37)
same because they don't have levels they (31:35 - 31:39)
just have you know well they have levels (31:37 - 31:42)
within certain well they have retails (31:39 - 31:43)
but that's all (31:42 - 31:47)
yeah but the yeah but that that yeah (31:43 - 31:49)
sure but you it's not the same thing I (31:47 - 31:51)
will not accept that it's the same thing (31:49 - 31:54)
yeah I mean like there there are areas (31:51 - 31:56)
they have more Health but you can always (31:54 - 31:58)
like if you're good at dodging you can (31:56 - 32:02)
beat literally any any uh enemy in (31:58 - 32:04)
breath of the wild with the same skill (32:02 - 32:07)
level if you are good at dodging yeah (32:04 - 32:09)
yeah no one no one no one's denying that (32:07 - 32:12)
but exactly if we're if we're talking (32:09 - 32:14)
about the average gamer the average (32:12 - 32:17)
gamer is going to play or explore levels (32:14 - 32:21)
based on how many hearts they have (32:17 - 32:21)
I don't remember a listen breath of wild (32:24 - 32:27)
but I'm not saying you're a liar I just (32:26 - 32:29)
don't remember looking at 100 I remember (32:27 - 32:31)
it because I looked and I think that's (32:29 - 32:32)
my point you don't remember the list (32:31 - 32:34)
because you probably didn't look at it I (32:32 - 32:35)
remember the list because I used it all (32:34 - 32:38)
the time and I loved it (32:35 - 32:38)
yeah I mean like and I guess this is why (32:38 - 32:43)
I started the conversation off with like (32:41 - 32:45)
what open world games did you play (32:43 - 32:48)
because a common theme in this is a lot (32:45 - 32:52)
of open world games are explore and if (32:48 - 32:54)
something is too difficult go somewhere (32:52 - 32:57)
else (32:54 - 32:57)
um (32:57 - 32:59)
and like I I just don't remember a (33:00 - 33:06)
specific order in Elden ring or Grand (33:03 - 33:08)
Theft Auto or inFAMOUS or any of those (33:06 - 33:11)
games that isn't (33:08 - 33:12)
just like (33:11 - 33:14)
here here's the next story beat do you (33:12 - 33:16)
want to go to it or not which I think (33:14 - 33:20)
Infamous had but there was so much to do (33:16 - 33:22)
otherwise (33:20 - 33:22)
and I (33:23 - 33:27)
I don't think that was ever a list it (33:25 - 33:29)
was just like (33:27 - 33:31)
it was it was the story pushing you (33:29 - 33:33)
forward but in this game there's three (33:31 - 33:35)
different stories so that's a little (33:33 - 33:36)
weird mm-hmm (33:35 - 33:39)
so I wonder if it's like if if it was (33:36 - 33:42)
one story if if a list would make sense (33:39 - 33:44)
but in this case of like I think it has (33:42 - 33:45)
to be (33:44 - 33:48)
one list right you can have like oh (33:45 - 33:50)
here's like there are so many ways you (33:48 - 33:51)
can do this and I'm not going to design (33:50 - 33:54)
this up front right because as I said (33:51 - 33:55)
like when I thought about it when I (33:54 - 33:56)
thought about it last week I came up (33:55 - 33:58)
with the idea of putting it on the map I (33:56 - 34:00)
now don't think that's the right idea I (33:58 - 34:01)
think a quest log is the better way (34:00 - 34:03)
because that's more hidden from people (34:01 - 34:05)
who don't want it but still nice and (34:03 - 34:06)
accessible for people but you can do (34:05 - 34:08)
certain things like for example and I'm (34:06 - 34:10)
not saying this is the good way to do it (34:08 - 34:11)
I'm just this is the first thing that (34:10 - 34:13)
pops into my mind when you're on the map (34:11 - 34:16)
and on the side it shows you uh Victory (34:13 - 34:20)
Road team star uh path of Legends if you (34:16 - 34:22)
were to be able to select one of those (34:20 - 34:24)
it could show you just a list of them (34:22 - 34:26)
and you click on one of the highlights (34:24 - 34:28)
on the map now that list would would be (34:26 - 34:30)
in order of levels that doesn't mean you (34:28 - 34:32)
have to go and look at it and those are (34:30 - 34:33)
three separate lists that you could have (34:32 - 34:36)
just an example of how yeah I get what (34:33 - 34:37)
you're saying it's not it's not (34:36 - 34:39)
necessarily that there's an order to (34:37 - 34:40)
these things because there are three (34:39 - 34:42)
different stories but you can absolutely (34:40 - 34:45)
do that in different ways I would kill (34:42 - 34:49)
for a list of trainers that I have (34:45 - 34:53)
fought and got the reward for I would I (34:49 - 34:57)
would murder a bag of cats I I know in (34:53 - 34:58)
an area (34:57 - 35:02)
one which area am I in for this person (34:58 - 35:05)
at this stop at this gas station this (35:02 - 35:07)
weirdo at the gas station says I needed (35:05 - 35:09)
to fight people in an area I don't know (35:07 - 35:11)
where that area is did I go from it did (35:09 - 35:14)
it come through it am I going to it (35:11 - 35:16)
where it what area are you talking about (35:14 - 35:19)
my friend I want your reward I think I (35:16 - 35:20)
don't know I also I don't know where (35:19 - 35:21)
these people are because they won't (35:20 - 35:24)
render on my map until I literally plow (35:21 - 35:26)
into them with my bike I think the (35:24 - 35:27)
trainers are the weakest part by far and (35:26 - 35:30)
I they do feel like an afterthought but (35:27 - 35:31)
I I think that to end this conversation (35:30 - 35:34)
and to talk about team star I think the (35:31 - 35:36)
the again the problem that I kind of (35:34 - 35:38)
have with the list is now that we've all (35:36 - 35:41)
beaten the game we know the order (35:38 - 35:44)
so if we were to play a new game (35:41 - 35:47)
that has now influenced how we might go (35:44 - 35:50)
forward versus that Fresh open World (35:47 - 35:52)
experience which they were trying to (35:50 - 35:54)
achieve of like what did you do first (35:52 - 35:55)
what did you there's no there's no (35:54 - 35:58)
coincidence that at the end of the game (35:55 - 36:00)
if you look at your map it shows you (35:58 - 36:03)
your order I did Mela first I did (36:00 - 36:05)
Bombardier second I did cloth fifth I (36:03 - 36:07)
did Eerie 17th (36:05 - 36:10)
like you the the whole point of that (36:07 - 36:12)
order is to screenshot it and to share (36:10 - 36:14)
like who did you do first and who did (36:12 - 36:15)
you do last (36:14 - 36:17)
but now that we've all beaten the game (36:15 - 36:18)
and now that people who have listening (36:17 - 36:21)
Pete in the game we will never have that (36:18 - 36:23)
experience again because we know the (36:21 - 36:26)
order and I think that is why I'm going (36:23 - 36:27)
to do it in that order (36:26 - 36:29)
you don't have to do it in that order (36:27 - 36:32)
right but you now know it that's the (36:29 - 36:34)
whole point I was making with like I (36:32 - 36:36)
mean for people like me I will have a (36:34 - 36:38)
better time in my second playthrough if (36:36 - 36:40)
I just had to Play It Again sure but (36:38 - 36:42)
again this is why I was talking about (36:40 - 36:44)
the extreme speed example if you had 10 (36:42 - 36:46)
HP and you know that Pokemon has extreme (36:44 - 36:47)
speed you will make a different decision (36:46 - 36:50)
if you know now that you know the order (36:47 - 36:52)
of the map you will now make different (36:50 - 36:54)
decisions (36:52 - 36:57)
when you didn't know the order you had a (36:54 - 36:58)
different experience than everyone else (36:57 - 37:01)
now you could go out to Serebii or Pokey (36:58 - 37:03)
jungle or Bulbapedia and you could look (37:01 - 37:04)
up the list because that's what you want (37:03 - 37:08)
but if I already know the information I (37:04 - 37:10)
can't unsee that information (37:08 - 37:11)
yeah I mean I agree that you'll make (37:10 - 37:15)
different decisions I I think (37:11 - 37:17)
depending on the person (37:15 - 37:21)
those those decisions will be made more (37:17 - 37:23)
positively are more negatively depending (37:21 - 37:26)
on what you want from a game and so I (37:23 - 37:28)
tend to agree with Al's having an option (37:26 - 37:32)
yeah to look at it to and so it would (37:28 - 37:33)
have enhanced my experience and the (37:32 - 37:35)
experience of another of other people (37:33 - 37:38)
who are like me or have it more hidden (37:35 - 37:39)
so that you don't ever have to look at (37:38 - 37:41)
it like you had with breath of the wild (37:39 - 37:42)
so it's a better experience for you I (37:41 - 37:45)
think there's a middle ground there that (37:42 - 37:47)
they didn't do I think the middle ground (37:45 - 37:49)
is a million percent Nurse Joy I think (37:47 - 37:51)
that should have been I mean I agree I (37:49 - 37:53)
agree with this I but I don't think a (37:51 - 37:56)
quest log checking it off because people (37:53 - 37:57)
make those things outside of the game (37:56 - 38:00)
and people use them all the time yeah (37:57 - 38:02)
yeah totally so like I don't I don't (38:00 - 38:06)
think an in-game solution is ever the (38:02 - 38:08)
wrong choice keeping people in their (38:06 - 38:11)
game is generally the right choice (38:08 - 38:13)
I think that's my frustration Greg is (38:11 - 38:16)
that for so like I I have my own lists (38:13 - 38:18)
that I build up of Pokemon games and (38:16 - 38:20)
I've done that since (38:18 - 38:23)
the first one in Sun and Moon Sun and (38:20 - 38:25)
Moon yeah yeah no you're right it was it (38:23 - 38:28)
was Sun England (38:25 - 38:28)
and I did not make I've back ported some (38:29 - 38:33)
other ones as well so I've got some like (38:32 - 38:35)
gen ones anyway not important (38:33 - 38:38)
um I I didn't do one for Legends because (38:35 - 38:40)
Legends had the quest system and that (38:38 - 38:42)
was far superior to anything that I (38:40 - 38:44)
could do and I didn't feel there was any (38:42 - 38:46)
need for it (38:44 - 38:49)
and the quest system in Legends is so (38:46 - 38:51)
good and made me so happy and then we (38:49 - 38:52)
come to this game and it doesn't have (38:51 - 38:53)
one now I know this happens with Pokemon (38:52 - 38:55)
games all the time we don't get features (38:53 - 38:57)
and that doesn't mean that that feature (38:55 - 38:58)
is not coming back because sometimes (38:57 - 39:00)
they'll develop they'll develop games (38:58 - 39:04)
and parallel and something will yeah (39:00 - 39:06)
with mass releases (39:04 - 39:09)
well you know maybe I'll come back maybe (39:06 - 39:13)
oh yeah I know I know but like so I get (39:09 - 39:14)
that it doesn't mean it's not coming (39:13 - 39:16)
back but it's just frustrating to go (39:14 - 39:18)
from one game with that great feature in (39:16 - 39:21)
my opinion that doesn't happen in this (39:18 - 39:23)
game and then we have to go back to that (39:21 - 39:25)
idea of what we need to use external (39:23 - 39:27)
sources to get all that good feature in (39:25 - 39:29)
my opinion yeah and again that's why I (39:27 - 39:31)
brought up that's why we I started the (39:29 - 39:33)
conversation with what open world games (39:31 - 39:35)
have we played and I have played I have (39:33 - 39:37)
played so many so a lot of this stuff (39:35 - 39:40)
was was second nature to me and (39:37 - 39:43)
um you two have not played a bunch (39:40 - 39:45)
compared to Me comparison comparatively (39:43 - 39:48)
yes I mean (39:45 - 39:48)
is probably not a good uh sign of a a (39:51 - 39:57)
game that kept your attention right all (39:56 - 40:00)
right exactly correct right and I think (39:57 - 40:02)
that's my point you know obviously I I (40:00 - 40:05)
stream on Twitch so I see I I can I can (40:02 - 40:06)
address those issues firsthand right (40:05 - 40:09)
like hey I can't find this location hey (40:06 - 40:11)
how does the map work hey who should I (40:09 - 40:13)
do next kind of thing (40:11 - 40:15)
um but I that's I I think we had the (40:13 - 40:19)
same exact conversation last week and we (40:15 - 40:20)
ultimately had the same conversation (40:19 - 40:22)
this week but I think the difference is (40:20 - 40:25)
that uh (40:22 - 40:27)
we had to have a frustrating (40:25 - 40:29)
conversation last week to have a more (40:27 - 40:31)
organized and structured conversation (40:29 - 40:34)
this week and I think if if I would have (40:31 - 40:36)
asked the question of what is your (40:34 - 40:38)
experience with open world games (40:36 - 40:40)
um I think the conversation last week (40:38 - 40:41)
would have been as structured as this as (40:40 - 40:43)
this week because I think that is the (40:41 - 40:44)
same (40:43 - 40:46)
situation you can ask another player (40:44 - 40:48)
right it the people agreeing with Al (40:46 - 40:53)
either on YouTube or or Slack are a lot (40:48 - 40:55)
of people who who not everyone I'm just (40:53 - 40:58)
saying a lot of people who tend to want (40:55 - 41:00)
a more linear direct give me a list (40:58 - 41:02)
experience and the people who has sided (41:00 - 41:03)
with me (41:02 - 41:06)
on YouTube or slack or Discord or twitch (41:03 - 41:09)
uh are are the people that probably (41:06 - 41:12)
enjoyed Elden run probably played breath (41:09 - 41:14)
of the wild probably played Witcher 3 at (41:12 - 41:16)
wild Hunt I'm not saying that everyone (41:14 - 41:18)
who agreed with me played Elden ring (41:16 - 41:20)
right I am just saying that like if you (41:18 - 41:22)
have a lot of experience with open World (41:20 - 41:24)
Games you're probably leaning towards my (41:22 - 41:27)
side of you and if you didn't have a lot (41:24 - 41:29)
of experience or you just frankly didn't (41:27 - 41:32)
like open world games I would say not (41:29 - 41:34)
experience if you got a lot of enjoyment (41:32 - 41:36)
out of open world games (41:34 - 41:38)
because there's a lot of people who have (41:36 - 41:40)
played it when we're gums and hate them (41:38 - 41:42)
and would disagree with you I think the (41:40 - 41:44)
I think the key there isn't experience I (41:42 - 41:46)
think is if you find enjoyment in a lot (41:44 - 41:48)
of open world games then you're gonna (41:46 - 41:51)
like this I think experience is (41:48 - 41:52)
different than enjoyment because I've (41:51 - 41:54)
experienced a lot of things that I'm (41:52 - 41:56)
like heck no never again you know I've (41:54 - 41:57)
experienced a lot of things in life that (41:56 - 41:59)
doesn't mean I enjoy them I don't enjoy (41:57 - 42:01)
them (41:59 - 42:01)
I think it's also different like I'm not (42:01 - 42:05)
I also not saying that I want a linear (42:03 - 42:07)
game like I'm not necessarily saying I (42:05 - 42:08)
want them to go back to linear Pokemon (42:07 - 42:09)
games I think some people might be (42:08 - 42:11)
saying that I'm certainly not I love the (42:09 - 42:12)
fact that you can go through these games (42:11 - 42:14)
in whatever order you want like I don't (42:12 - 42:16)
want that being taken away I think (42:14 - 42:17)
that's great the fact that someone can (42:16 - 42:19)
go you know what I'm gonna go crazy and (42:17 - 42:22)
go beat the final gym before I do any of (42:19 - 42:23)
the others I think that's great that (42:22 - 42:26)
people can do that absolutely I do like (42:23 - 42:28)
I don't think I think that is one of the (42:26 - 42:30)
reasons that breath of the wild became (42:28 - 42:32)
so big was because of all that (42:30 - 42:34)
flexibility and the ability to do things (42:32 - 42:35)
and like you'd see this person like (42:34 - 42:38)
doing a speed run of breath of the wild (42:35 - 42:40)
and you're like you're insane obviously (42:38 - 42:41)
you can't quite do the same sort of (42:40 - 42:43)
speed running Pokemon because you can't (42:41 - 42:45)
just go and beat the Elite Four right (42:43 - 42:47)
you do have to do the gyms right before (42:45 - 42:49)
that right but I think that I think (42:47 - 42:50)
that's like there was a way to trick her (42:49 - 42:53)
during that test though (42:50 - 42:55)
here I'm not trying to get rid of that (42:53 - 42:57)
you know there's one thing I wanted them (42:55 - 43:00)
to add is let me put comments on the (42:57 - 43:02)
floor in the map of Pokemon world oh my (43:00 - 43:04)
God for other people to see because I (43:02 - 43:06)
would be running around paldea just (43:04 - 43:09)
writing smell you later everywhere the (43:06 - 43:11)
world be littered with me writing smell (43:09 - 43:13)
you later Ash that's all I would say and (43:11 - 43:15)
I'd move on you know Dark Soul players (43:13 - 43:18)
are a different breed yep (43:15 - 43:19)
like (43:18 - 43:21)
the interesting thing about Elden ring (43:19 - 43:23)
is they did have that system of of (43:21 - 43:26)
people writing comments like don't go (43:23 - 43:28)
right go left (43:26 - 43:32)
in caves which in I saw you use a lot (43:28 - 43:33)
when you were playing it so it's like (43:32 - 43:36)
it's a weird system of community-based (43:33 - 43:40)
guideposts that you could interact with (43:36 - 43:42)
a drew some people were like haha I'm (43:40 - 43:43)
gonna lie but you could tell right yeah (43:42 - 43:45)
pretty easy and it was interesting (43:43 - 43:47)
because like you you didn't have a guide (43:45 - 43:49)
except you had a guide of other people (43:47 - 43:51)
leaving you comments (43:49 - 43:53)
yeah everywhere I feel like a thing not (43:51 - 43:58)
talked about is the co-op right like if (43:53 - 44:01)
you know in Elder like Elden ring won (43:58 - 44:03)
from the joystick Awards best co-op (44:01 - 44:05)
experience it that's what we've just (44:03 - 44:06)
talked about it on the the normal (44:05 - 44:09)
episode the normal weekly show this week (44:06 - 44:11)
you know Elden ring won best co-op I (44:09 - 44:14)
never zero Co-op for me I never had (44:11 - 44:16)
anyone come into my world I never went (44:14 - 44:18)
to anyone's world I played that solo and (44:16 - 44:21)
I would probably I'm gonna assume that (44:18 - 44:23)
three of us played these games solo (44:21 - 44:27)
like the the story solo Oh yeah yeah (44:23 - 44:29)
um so I do another person's World who's (44:27 - 44:30)
like hey have you been here and I'm like (44:29 - 44:31)
I don't know what you're talking about (44:30 - 44:33)
so he jumped in the same world and they (44:31 - 44:35)
walked me there yeah so that's what I'm (44:33 - 44:38)
that's what I'm thinking of like like (44:35 - 44:40)
that is something you know in today's (44:38 - 44:42)
conversation in last week's conversation (44:40 - 44:43)
we didn't even talk about like if (44:42 - 44:44)
somebody was maybe struggling or didn't (44:43 - 44:46)
know where to go there is that (44:44 - 44:48)
opportunity to be like let me join your (44:46 - 44:50)
world I'll walk you to the next place (44:48 - 44:52)
although I don't think it's some of the (44:50 - 44:55)
craziest bugs that have ever happened in (44:52 - 44:59)
the game look at this I do want to take (44:55 - 45:00)
a quick break and then I do want to talk (44:59 - 45:03)
about the story uh of the the team star (45:00 - 45:05)
I think I think (45:03 - 45:07)
uh you know open world going forward I (45:05 - 45:09)
think we talked about that to death now (45:07 - 45:12)
um but uh yes I think the team star (45:09 - 45:13)
stuff does some really interesting (45:12 - 45:16)
battle mechanics but we will be right (45:13 - 45:17)
back (45:16 - 45:28)
[Music] (45:17 - 45:28)
