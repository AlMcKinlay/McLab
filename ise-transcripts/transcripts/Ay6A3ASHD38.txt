[Music] hmm [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 430th episode of the pokemon podcast i think it's 430. yeah 430 episode of the pokemon podcast i'm your host sbj here and uh no will and greg i'm actually recording this on a thursday evening earlier this week we had an interview with pokey jungle uh which you could probably tell by the title of the episode um so that's what this episode is going to be we have a 40 minute interview with poke jungle that will come after the break we have just a tiny bit of news here um that i'm just going to cover by myself i didn't want to drag will and greg into a thursday night recording when they have lives and it's it's it's nothing really it's not the most major news in the world so uh just tackle this news real quick we'll go to a break it'll be poke jungle uh talking about his experience as well living in japan running the website rumors all that stuff and then that will be uh and then that will be the episode for today so no question of the week no pokemon of the week no will no greg you just gotta put up with me for like the next like well i'm in the interview part two well you gotta put up with me for like 10 minutes of news and then that's it so uh probably like less than an hour episode i'm assuming this is going to be but last week's episode was two hours and next week's episode will be the final episode before crown tundra so we'll probably have a lot to cover before then and then obviously a lot to cover afterwards uh so let's get into the news real quick [Music] first bit of news here is charmander community day we did not talk about this last week but uh just a reminder it is saturday october 17th from 11 to 5. obviously shiny charmander uh when if you evolve charmeleon into charizard you will know the move dragon breath which is the fast type move so there is no blast burn this time around i believe niantic has uh confirmed that blast burn is only with the uh pay to win uh tms that you can only buy like once a month speaking of that there will be a one-time special purchase for uh 12 dollars and 80 cents aka 1280 pokey coins featuring the elite charge tm it will also come with three incubators three star pieces and 30 ultra balls i still i'll bang this drum every week i still think this is a ripoff i still think this is very pay to win i think this is very damaging out of a lot of things that are wrong with pokemon go this is definitely one of them for sure but uh we don't need to dwell on that uh there will be event timed at research and field research to earn mega charizard candy energy i don't know what they're calling it the things that mega evolve your charizard and then for one dollar they are doing an october community exclusive special research story which will also include charizard mega energy the bonus let's say you don't care about chinese charmander maybe you already have a million of them the bonus is gonna be three times catch stardust and your incense will last for three hours instead of the one hour we did talk about last week how niantic nerfed the incense prior to covid and incense was 30 minutes and if you were not moving you would get a spawn once every five minutes when kovid started uh they doubled it so uh they doubled the time so instead of lasting 30 minutes to last an hour we all know this but you would get a spawn about every 60 seconds which is 60 an hour and recently what we talked about last week niantic changed the incense but didn't really specify or explain the web their blog post they just said it went back to normal but it will still last an hour we talked about this they changed it from every 60 seconds if you were moving to about every 90 seconds give or take um depending on how fast you're catching just some basic math because i don't think we did the math last week but instead of getting 60 spawns an hour in your house you would get 40 spawns an hour which is still good better than the uh five six spawns you would have gotten uh with the initial incense and let's just say they doubled that that would have been 12. so better than what it was before but not as good as it was timing on that has not particularly been good but here we are next big news here this is actually really exciting for me i'm actually really really excited for this uh it's it's hard to explain here on a podcast but this is pokemon.com they're announcing a premium collection ultra premium collection ultra premium collection for zashian and zamazenta this is for the pokemon tcg if you like black and gold which totally my aesthetics aesthetics that's a word i'm probably putting an extra letter in there uh if you like black and gold this looks awesome it is a tcg thing it's coming with one special gold version of zashian fee this is they've done this before they i think the first like major big gold cards that people freaked out about was resham and zekrom back in black and white but a special gold version of zashian v a special gold version of z zama zenta v you get two sets of metal damage counters so that's 12 dice total uh metal which is awesome not the plastic that comes in the elite trainer boxes you get two metal coins featuring zamasunta and zashian you will get two sets of card sleeves one featuring one featuring zashian one featuring zamasunta you get 130 sleeves total you will get quote a set of richly richly designed metal condition markers so that would be your um poison or your burn you will get 16 booster packs for the sword and shield series so uh they're not very clear what this is but they do say from the sword and shield series so this could be bass short sword and shield short and shield bass sword and shield rebel clash darkness ablaze am i missing a set i think those are the three sets uh i guess maybe i doubt champion's path um and then vivid voltage will be vivid voltage will be out by then i believe so i'm not sure if it will include vivid voltage it doesn't specifically say but this does launch november 20th it will come with a player's guide of course the rule book the tcg online it will be available wherever cards are sold there is no price on this 16 booster packs times four dollars and i'll just say 50 cents is 72 bucks and of course you always pay the pokemon tax on the special packet especially because like you're always like an elite trainer box you're you're paying like an extra what is it like six or eight dollars just kind of for everything around it um so i'm expecting this will be 99 that's gonna be my guess it's probably gonna be a hundred bucks 16 booster packs two sets of metal dice two sets of metal coins one special zamasu one special zashian um if you want to see it it's on pokemon.com it's literally on their homepage it should still be there should be easy find it looks awesome though it looks very very cool uh and if you're a collector and you like boxes i guess there's a box for you uh this was sent in by andrew our uh resident japanese correspondent in our addict channel in slack cannon made a camera a point and shoot camera for kids uh with pikachu on it this is also hard to describe so imagine like those gosh this is gonna show my age here where's when when there's no will or greg in the show i'm now the oldest and now i am ultimate boomer uh i'm too old okay so when i was a kid the thing that was the coolest was like those point-and-shoot cameras you would get at walgreens or or cvs i don't even know how much they were they were like eight dollars but then you you took you could take like 60 photos and then you would take it back to walgreens and they would develop the film and stuff so it kind of looks like that a point and shoot camera except it has like a built-in carabiner so you can just latch it onto your backpack or your uh belt loop really quickly which is cool it doesn't look like there's a flash on it but that's fine because flash doesn't work ever the front of the camera if you remember the like pikachu 3ds and it was like all yellow and then it was just pikachu's eyes mouth and cheeks it it has that aesthetic why is this the word of the episode it has that look going for it but they will be selling separate what are called jackets so you can change out the front with different um they have like yamper and pikachu they have a raichu pikachu pichu they have a bunch of pikachu that peachy with the glaring starters pikachu with the um cantonian starter canton starters the back has a couple features uh so it looks like it has a camera it looks like it has a video feature and then it looks like it has uh so the camera feature the video feature it looks like it can take a picture and apply pikachu's cheeks to the subject so if you're taking like a picture of like somebody's face it puts pikachu's cheeks on them i think that's what it means sorry the website's in japanese uh i'm doing my best here with google translate and the other thing is it looks like there is built in either wi-fi or bluetooth to transfer the pictures to your phone directly which is probably the coolest part because who's developing anything so it was available for purchase on pokemon center dot pokemon center hyphen online.com which is the japanese pokemon center it was uh 000 yen which comes to about 175 dollars usd so uh not a cheap gift for your kids but it does apparently shoot video and shoot and has bluetooth i guess there was an exclusive bonus or if you did order it off pokemon center you got a little pikachu tail charm that you could attach to your camera or your phone you also got a pokeball lanyard you also got an exclusive face paint faceplate for it they were also selling it on store dot canon dot jp but they have not released pre-orders for that yet but the pre-orders for the japanese pokemon center was completely sold out oh they also have like the canon is offering bundles so they're offering um uh i'm really trying to milk this milk give you guys a little bit of a locker episode of milking this so they offer a leisure bundle which is cool uh so that comes with a that weird youtuber octopus tripod stand a memory card a canon water bottle and then it looks like some stickers and then there's a family bundle which comes with two of these pikachu cameras and then it comes with a uh two sd cards the leisure bundle also comes with the sd card and then it comes with a printer so you can print these at home like one of those um not like a like not like a canon well not like a big printer like a photo printer one of the little ones that just print kind of cool probably a novelty thing i'm sure i i can't imagine these cameras are taking better pictures than like somebody's like pixel phone or somebody's iphone or something or like almost every android phone that has probably come out in the last couple years i don't know too much about sensors and the japanese website doesn't really go like it doesn't really go into depth of what kind of sensors they are that i can that i can see but it's cool it's it's something and that's that's pretty much all the news so camera new tcg thing brand new that was actually announced this week and then the pokemon go stuff coming up by the time you listen to this podcast uh giratina should be in raids for pokemon go that is the current raid boss that is the first time that origin form giratina is shiny origin form is the one that looks like the snake and as we lead up to crown tundra just a reminder that we will be doing a 12 hour crown tundra stream starting at noon central time on october 23rd so from noon to midnight i will be playing crown tundra it should be releasing in the united states uh the evening of the 22nd so as long as you play that evening or that morning for an hour or two you'll be way ahead of me so you don't have to worry about spoilers but that'll be really exciting that friday for the crown tundra and we'll be playing up we'll be obviously playing and streaming on twitch up to that did i say it was on twitch twitch.tv slash pkm and cast 12 hour stream crown tundra uh october 23rd and we'll probably be doing a lot of crown tundra for the rest of the year hopefully there's enough to do but there's plenty of stuff i still need to do in crown uh isle of armor and base sword shield as well uh i do plan on streaming charmander comedian day so if you are not fortunate enough to be able to leave your house due to the circumstances of the world and you want you're playing at home and you want uh something in the background i do plan on irl streaming safely charmander's exterminator community day on the 17th also if you're listening to this on monday or tuesday i do plan on streaming the pikachu event on october 13th on twitch i will be irl again safely so if you are catching ash hat pikachu at home and you need something to watch i'll be streaming that for like two or three hours that evening and i think that's it i think that's everything with that being said i'm going to throw it over to our break music we are going to go into the interview with pokejungle i hope you enjoy it as a really fun interview he's a really great guy uh and then that's our episode and then we will be back on the 19th with a normal full episode will and greg will be back right before cron tundra and then of course we'll have our crown tundra impressions on october 26 and we will not talk about story for crown tundra but we will talk about mechanics and stuff like if they add any diglett thing or that they had uh the battle dude in the tower that was a surprise of the olive armor so we'll be talking about that kind of stuff but if you're worried about story we'll save the story for the following podcast which would be november 2nd that gives you a little over a week to do the story and i'm expecting the story is only going to be like two to three hours if you play slow we will be right back hey uh what do you guys think about pumpkin spice skin spice pumpkin spices pumpkin spice fresh flakes pumpkin spices pumpkin spice mini wheat pumpkin spices [Music] pumpkin spice dr pepper [Music] all right we are back from our break we are here with paul aka pokey jungle uh web what is webmaster still a word do people use that you know what you can call me webmaster that's all right i kinda hate it owner owner of pokerjungle.net sure sure uh how are you i'm doing well thanks for so much for having me on the podcast today yeah excited to have you on we're gonna we're very close to crown tundra so the timing is probably for the best yeah i am super super excited for that yeah it's very very soon yeah and you know what luckily shadowlands was pushed back for world of warcraft so i don't even have to worry about like the overall crunch pokemon usually always comes out like where another big game comes out and there's always like conflict there unless you're only a pokemon fan that can be the worst so for those that don't know who you are which i find hard to believe but uh just maybe a little bit about yourself what you do um well i started poke jungle back in about 2004 and i've been running it kind of since um i did take like a year off before gen 5 just for like mental health reasons but like i'm just a pokemon super fan and part of the way that i love to embrace the series is just to cover the news um and yeah i've i've lived in japan for a total of nine years which is really fun and now i'm back in the us so it's kind of it's kind of different you know because when you're in japan you get to enjoy pokemon in such a different way um just because it's it's i would say a bigger thing over there you know like i would just be able to like play pokemon go uh raids you know there would be like groups of people just standing on the streets and i found that's a little bit different you know like in america pre-pandemic even but yeah i i i guess that's who i am all right i i do want to talk about the japan stuff i know that's a big part of your your history but before we get there what was your uh first experience with with pokemon was it the red and blue was it the gold and silver was it the anime the tcg so actually i started playing with pokemon crystal and i like when i grew up my parents were not into like video games they were very limited you know like my screen time was very limited um and they didn't want extra like screens brought into the house um so i yeah i didn't have a game boy and i finally got a game boy advance this was before gen 3 launched but at that time i just had a game boy advance and i bought pokemon crystal and that was when i first got to play it but obviously like i did get to play through friends who had red and blue so sure i was there since the beginning i just like i didn't get to be like really hands-on um with the games until crystal okay and that's kind of what started everything was there i always i was asked to stall all the all the people we interviewed but was there ever like a fallout with pokemon where you're like oh i can't i gotta step away it's too nerdy i'm getting made fun of it's not the cool thing um i you know like i'm i'm a nerd and i just i just kind of embrace that and i live with it and i'm i i okay i don't really talk about pokemon in like offline very much um but i kind of just own you know like my my love of the series and i you know sadly in elementary school this is kind of embarrassing to admit but like i was like the fifth grader who still had like pokemon cards on the bus and you know like the kids who'd want to trade me were in like third or fourth grade i knew so i was kind of the odd man out you know like still still with the series so what you're saying is you got the sick deals because it's very easy to rip off third graders okay i'm not you know what this is tape so i'm not admitting to anything right now 2004 you decided to launch pokejungle yep and uh i believe there was a lot of i felt like a lot of website that was like the the 2000s things right uh the very 2000 thing of um cereby bulbapedia pokebeach gosh i can't even remember the other ones uh but those are probably the three that are still around i'm assuming you knew those sites existed was there was there anything of like i can do this better or i can do this differently or what was what was the mindset initially you know i don't know if i ever thought that i could do it better um but i just knew that i wanted to do it and for some reason i just love the concept of like web development and everything um that goes along with it so that was you know what this is super funny but like my real foray into web website building actually started with neopets because i wanted to make a website for my like little neopets guild um and at that time like i didn't know how to make layouts or anything so this was just a geocities website and and basically it was just like centered content because i didn't know how to like make a table and like have sidebars or a banner so it's just literally like centered text down a page you know like with a eye blinding you know magenta color background or something um and there was a website i think it's still there it's like lisa explains it all or something it's like a very female oriented html development for like kids kind of website from the early 2000s um and i would just go on there and read a bunch of stuff and i loved pokemon so i didn't do anything further with neopets but that was kind of my launching point into like oh hey like cerabi looks so cool i i want to make up my own website so um cerebri was definitely a big inspiration i guess of why i wanted to do it but there were a ton there were just so many um websites back then like there was pokemon safari um pokey cave i think um it was just it was like the thing to do was to make pokemon websites at that point in time so well if you wanted to see what cereb looked like back then just go to serbia right now because it hasn't changed uh i'm no comment like we all know that joe does cerebe pretty much full time and bulbapedia is like 7 million people updating uh is there is there a team over at pokejungle is it just you is it a full-time thing is it a hobby thing um because you do get news out pretty quickly i do get news out pretty quickly um but right now i would say it's pretty small um i've always had like a group of a quarter of people that helped me um for instance our designer is sam um and he's been just creating some amazing things for us i think for probably five years now um and that's been great because i suck at graphics uh that's that's definitely one of my weaknesses so yeah it's awesome well that you know what if it does and thank you uh that's because of him so um he's been a huge help for me we also have had like many team members um that just you know try to write and cover the news especially in earlier generations um right now it is pretty much just me and then we also have um nick who's been writing some origin of species articles for us but yeah they're you know and i don't know like there's too many people think right now but there are a lot of people have put a lot of hard work and effort into um helping me and making the site better yeah that's awesome and you got verified on twitter so that that's that's huge i you know what i was i got verified before serbia i'm not gonna brag but so how does that transition into you living in japan was that a school thing was that a work thing was that uh a pokemon thing because you were there for almost a decade right yeah um there so i lived yeah so well first of all i wanted to be a game designer like in middle school i was like okay i want to design games um and i think you know maybe for a lot of gamers that's like kind of the dream you know you love playing games and you want them you want to make them um and i kind of saw japan like many people do as kind of a mecca of game design stuff i think that's shifted a little bit um and you know like there's a lot of great game development studios in the us now um as well but at that time i like i just decided i want to be an exchange student i want to go to japan i want to learn stuff and you know like understand the culture you know that is behind some of these great games so that was kind of my reasoning for being a high school exchange student um and that was my i went there during 11th grade and stayed there for a year in osaka um and it you know it was great and i i always try to encourage people if they want to do like an exchange program either in school or college or whatever um to do it because you just learn so much about a different culture and it doesn't matter if it's japan or wherever i just feel like it's a great life experience so i'll give a little shout out to exchange programs but uh i you know it really it really was a good experience i didn't necessarily think that i would go back to japan after i came home but you said that was that was a year in 11th grade yeah yeah so then your senior year would have been in the states yep and then i graduated and kind of just did community college um because i at that point i didn't want to be a game designer anymore but i didn't know what exactly i wanted to be so i thought i would just get the general stuff out of the way and then you know go somewhere else but actually i started dating a japanese guy who was living in the states and he graduated um and was gonna go back to japan and i was like well i'm not really doing anything right now so um i temple temple university in philadelphia has a japanese tokyo campus so i applied there i got in and um then i switched colleges so i was you know i went over to tokyo and even after graduating um i just kind of stayed and was i was teaching i was teaching english for kids mostly and it was just a great place especially you know doing my website um to be really close to the beat of pokemon news um because a lot of times i'm sleeping when you know like the japanese news comes out yeah but there was there was no time zone issues really when i was living there and i could get a lot of cool footage and pictures and stuff um for social media and for my website so it just it just kind of worked out what made you come back was it the was it pandemic stuff no actually i i wanted to get married japan still doesn't have marriage equality and my boyfriend now husband um and i you know like we we were in it for the long term and we wanted to get married start a life together and then i also just you know like my my grandma has moved over to memory care and stuff and if if i hadn't had family issues that were pressing because of my grandma i could have stayed longer you know because marriage is just a piece of paper you know it's really being with the person you love and i could have done that in japan um but that was like a real motivating factor for me to come back so i came back i got married in the basement of her nursing home so she could be there um and it was it was honestly a great decision i think because then the pandemic happened and you know we're still not out of it but i can't visit her right now and i'm just so happy that i got to see um her before this all started dang you didn't warn me that i needed like tissues before this episode sorry that's a sweet story um wow okay uh hard to follow that up that's good let's shift gears a little bit uh because you you're you were in japan when um sword and shield dropped yeah so i i'd imagine that was we're gonna have to talk about national dexter's here for a second um so sword and shield people were really really hyped when the initial trailer dropped and i think where the the the conversation changed was around e3 where they said they weren't bringing the pokemon in and then the national deck stuff broke out obviously you know we're we're a year almost a year with sword and shield and it's sold incredibly well um the people that were unhappy and didn't buy it are still unhappy and still didn't buy it the people who did get it for the most part uh seem to enjoy it uh was there that outrage that you saw firsthand um or or were okay sorry i gotta clarify i will clarify i was actually in the u.s for the the launch um because i came back in may 2019 i just double checked uh but for the announcement and everything for the announcement that was early yeah that was earlier i think there there was definitely a lot of heat in the japanese fandom too because i read the japanese twitter i don't know like by topics and stuff i don't follow a huge amount of accounts but like i'll dive in um when i'm covering different issues and just like see what's going on outside of our western um impressions or thoughts and stuff and i i want to see both sides so they were not not pleased i think and i think it was a very similar uh reaction to what we had really and then what were your what were your thoughts on sword and shield yourself when it arrived was it was it disappointing was it was it better than you expected worse than you expected what you expected you know what i will be completely honest i was i was running through that first route and i thought to myself am i getting too old for this and it was just such a weird thought because you know like i i've never really had that thought playing pokemon before but at first it was just like a little bit hard for me to get into and i don't know if it was just like the jump to the switch you know like i i'll be honest i never finished let's go um so i already kind of left that go um but i you know this was let's go the canto like what was the hold on before we get to certain shield what was the what was the did you have issues with let's go did you think it was a a bad game or shouldn't have been made or catered too much for casuals um no i actually appreciate that they are making a you know like i think if they separate the series a little bit i think it allows them to make a very guided experience for younger or less experienced fans um and hopefully my hope would be that they can retain a lot of you know the complexity and even add more complexity into the main line games um and let's go as technically mainline if you know you go with that but um you know for the non let's go titles yeah so for me for me it was just a little bit too guided didn't really offer me anything i i didn't like the catching system i think that was probably the number one thing um and it's so dumb but like after you release the ball and let's go it still like keeps the circle like keeps moving but in go it like stops you know like you flick the ball and the circle is like there still the same size so just like even that for whatever reason that small detail just annoyed me so much it was just like you know if you're gonna make a catching system that's based off go why why does it feel different you know like why am i trying to time things differently and it just was not a smooth transition and i was just like uh there's other stuff i could be doing right now yeah so and then and then jumping into sword and shield i'm not sure exactly what it was i think maybe it was still a little bit leftover feelings like from let's go that maybe this was gonna be too simplistic and i think the storyline you know like it is just it's a pokemon game you know you're not jumping in a final fantasy convoluted you know like whatever but but after that first route i started getting more into it i started uh enjoying some of the designs and stuff some of the little touches um so for me personally my impression was very positive of the games and you said you said at the start you're you're excited for crown tundra yeah yeah uh what was your how do you feel about the the dlc um the dlc route in general and of course isle of armor your thoughts on that but you know we're so used to having like a a third version of a game and they decided dlc this time i feel a little bit conflicted to be honest i love the new pokemon like glorion uh glorian slobro was super cool to me um and in some ways it just like it sucks that i can't use it on my team going through the storyline um and of course if you're just starting you know after i believe you unlock the wild area you kind of hop over to the isle of armor and do that but like for gamers who had already played through this you know we're past that point uh so i it's like so stupid in a way but i just love to like you know have my team with me and like it kind of builds up your affinity for these pokemon but like just catching a glorion slowpoke okay evolving it you know like it doesn't create the same bond no i feel you so i don't have like those fun memories of like i don't know defeating this gym or that gym with this you know pokemon and it was so in that in that sense i prefer third versions because if there are other forms if there are different pokemon to catch on the way that weren't you know originally available in that route you know you can you can more fully integrate it into your gameplay experience um and i didn't get that from the dlc but yeah that's that's super fair and i i kind of felt the same the only the only thing that i think outweighs that for me is not having to collect everything again like i don't want to stock back up on rare candy or experience candy large or carbos or like my other game has all of these and now i don't have them anymore well and i think that is one of the great things about the isle of armor because they just added so many good like quality of life uh features i feel like and even having the you know the dojo get the vending machines and like just having a lot of stuff there you can change your outfit you can heal or whatever without a long animation it was it did feel like a good addition to the game and especially for people who wanted to like create better teams yeah it was very uh very competitive focused uh if you were into that if you're into the vitamins and the move tutors and the restrictive sparring and stuff like that i draw the line uh at injections i won't inject my pokemon with chemicals but giving them vitamins i'll do that sure so crown tundra bringing back all the legends doing the co-op is there anything specifically you're looking forward to in that dlc um i'm actually okay so like i do really like the new reggie trio or well it's not trio anymore i don't okay i don't actually like the original reggie trio for whatever reason i'm just not into them but the new ones i really like the dragon and electric ones they their designs just really look cool to me so i'm excited to see those i really think they did a great job with the glorion bird trio so that's cool slow king is uh i i love it but i hate it but i love it so um i think that's all great i'm a little bit worried about the story um if it's super story focused i'm not sure if i'm gonna actually enjoy that part of it but the environments uh that you get to like explore and stuff have looked really cool from the trailer in my opinion yeah i don't know if i can say i was disappointed with the isle of armor story it's just kind of what i expected them to do which is like this short maybe two hours if you're a slow player experience well i i just thought that there was going to be something that was super replayable like a kind of a battle frontier sort of experience um and i mean they did add like some extra new things for like online battling but it just it didn't have the like single player replayability that i thought that they were going to be adding kind of yeah i thought that the two towers weren't going to be useless when you finished it and then the two towers ended up being useless yeah i was like okay what you know like i i thought they were gonna be like a battle tower ask situation so right yeah i thought so too i thought it was gonna be like endless floors or something that you climb uh but they're just two towers that exist nice though from the outside are you still playing go i know it's hard with pandemic but um you brought up how go was very different in japan yeah so i still play go um i'm i wouldn't call myself like a super uh i don't know invested player but i'm definitely a casual player and i love collecting uh my favorite pokemon and i just you know i like participating in the little events that they have as far as like the difference between the us and japan it was just so widespread um and i think part of that was just because i was living in tokyo where there's a huge population um i can't speak for rural areas of japan which i think probably are different in their experience of the game but for me like i could just i could see a raid happening and usually there would be people there you know there there wasn't a lot of time where i would have to try to take something down by myself and even if there was no one in the lobby you could like jump in and usually two or three or four people would jump in too because they're like waiting for someone to like take the plunge so it was just it was just so nice to be able to participate in the raid events and stuff and special pokemon that appeared in like five star legendary pokemon really most of the time just because you know there was there was so much transport and activity um but in minnesota where i live now um besides like the community days i don't see that but i think probably like mall of america um is our big mall here in minnesota and i think there's probably there there'd probably be a kind of a similar experience i'm sure i don't that's like an hour away from me so i don't get up there very often and especially now during the pandemic i wouldn't but i'm i'm pretending this there's not a pandemic and hopefully this will go back to normal in the future but yeah when i've uh visited minnesota mall america was for sure the the place to be for for pokemon go oh but you know actually okay so touching on this one thing i will say that has really helped keep me alive right now at my job there's actually a group of pokemon go players um and we have a slack chat to communicate so that has been a huge thing for me and actually my where i work to would have they had um a gym and well several gyms around and also a pokemon stop that could be accessed internally like when without leaving the building um so i felt really lucky that i got a job where i did and um that is that helped me keep like the momentum kind of going um until like everything became work from home and now i have i have nothing around me so i appreciated niantic's work like play from home uh bonuses that just ended yeah i'm a little salty yeah a little little weird on why now out of all the time i remember when i was in japan for three two two and a half three weeks there was uh in osaka where that giant gosh that's like that bridge with the running dude oh yeah yeah yeah i remember there was there were raids popping non-stop and every raid it wasn't even like an event like i could i think it was like a two-star i don't know like a menchino or something something no one cared about and they would just fill to 20. and yeah and look around and you could see you could i mean it's very easy to spot a pogo player they're the ones tapping their screen and not looking at it but it was kind of crazy how people just like they would show up they would just join the raid there was like no communication and then when the raid was over everyone just dispersed but if you walk to another raid it was like the same thing and that was kind of my entire experience in japan of like the game is just more maybe because japan is so close together with everything and it's like very hard to like not walk 10 feet without uh something being a pokestop yeah that i mean that's true too like there's there's a lot available you know at least in the city so yeah yeah it was a pretty wild experience and so you being you being over there for nine years you had you know constant access to pokemon centers you had all the gotcha machines that were at like train stations and bus stops and stuff uh and that stuff is like regularly updated i remember walking into like a 7-11 and they just had like pokemon face masks or like pokemon lotion yeah that stuff is like everywhere over there i still have i have not opened but i bought one of the bulbasaur face masks you know like the beauty face masks i should probably open it before it dries out i guess that would be a special youtube video i guess do you do you like miss that that culture though i mean like i think i think japan obviously being number one with pokemon stuff and america being number two but i can't walk into like a gas station and find anything pokemon here yeah it i mean like it really does it really does suck for people in the us and i'm sure it's the same way in europe although europe doesn't even have the online pokemon center so it was jarring to come back but it's probably saved me money so maybe i should be glad but the funny thing is i actually worked in one of the same buildings because there it was the classroom was kind of um located in an office building um that was connected to a mall and that mall had a pokemon center in it so i was just able to like get off work go to the pokemon center and then go home like and i would work there like twice a week for a while so um yeah i mean it was just crazy like it it took no effort to you know like go anywhere and find pokemon stuff right i remember getting off the uh off the plane um i was like i wonder how long it'll take for us to see something pokemon and it was like literally instantly there was like a pokemon vending machine right off the plane yeah yeah the the pokemon center is there they update like almost weekly right with new stuff yeah i mean it's i basically it is kind of weekly isn't it because i do cover like the updates to the merchandise on twitter and you know like every week they announced you know goods and those aren't sold for you know three more weeks but it's just this rolling cycle and so you're there are you know like it's not gonna be boring i guess if you go to a pokemon center one week the next week you're probably gonna find something fun and new so are there plans for you to eventually go back to japan maybe when the world isn't imploding anymore yeah well actually um my husband's sister had a baby so we are just we are dying to go back and see his family and meet our new nephew so it's been it's actually been hard to be away from japan because we actually had plans to go back um this fall and that's not gonna happen now but uh as soon as possible we will we will be back not for pokemon specifically but i you know will probably go uh to a pokemon center maybe buy a few gotcha machines so what do you what do you think is is next here uh on the the i guess your expertise or your speculation you know we're getting we're getting the next dlc and by the time this episode goes up in like two weeks uh do you do you see more dlc do you see uh a remake of diamond or pearl which i don't think the internet has showed up about since the remakes of ruby and sapphire do you see another let's go game do you see you well anything else i i don't i you know what it's so you know i have no special insider knowledge about anything but it just i'm open i'm ready for anything and i would be fine if there was more sword and shield dlc there are still pokemon that weren't you know added with these two dlc releases um but on the other hand okay let's go i'm going to give let's go a second chance if one of them is let's go togepi for jodo i would be fine with that um because one of the one of my favorite things about those games were like the customization you could do and i love togepi i actually loved eevee um but oh you mean customizing your like eevee character yeah yeah yeah um but honestly i kind of i kind of think that we'll be done with the dlc almost for a sword and shield and then maybe move on to the next thing which which could be like a collection of pokemon games released for the switch like past games because there have been rumors about that so we'll have to see whether it's actually going to be a remake of diamond pearl or like they're going to wait until gen 9 to do that um and you know maybe they're just going to release release kind of a multi-pack for the switch of of games for like the 3ds so i'm not sure and your site unlike um cerebe reports on rumors yeah we do and i get a lot of flack for that um online and i think a lot of people maybe view my site as being like unreliable um because of that but i do my best to make it very very clear you know like when we're covering rumors i include red text at the top you know this is do not believe that it's okay yeah but i just i think that being able to talk about rumors and like possible you know additions or ideas added in the games um i think it's fun for fans and it's fun for me so you know if it wasn't fun for me i wouldn't do it you know like some people do think it's just for like clickbait and stuff but honestly what i find interesting is what i put on this website so yeah i mean like uh i know we we on the podcast covered the um pokemon stars rumor pretty closely but the main reason we covered it is because there was pretty good it was it was coming from a pretty reliable source i mean it was coming from eurogamer which you know they they got this they got the sun and moon stuff pretty early they got the switch stuff all right before the switch even released so it was like it's kind of really hard to ignore where the source is coming from and whether or not like stars was a real thing or it was cancelled or it was a code name and they changed it i mean it is what it is i don't think a lot of people even remember it at this point but sometimes it's hard to ignore the uh what was that oh it was the incineroar primarina and decidueye that was leaked and then everyone thought they were fake and then yeah it was it was like eight months early we saw them and then we were like whoa these were real the entire time yeah and you know what props to joe for not deleting his tweet saying they're not real um i have mad respect for him for you know like keeping that up um it's you know like those are the wild times or even like i i posted the um picture of the trainer writing lapras before let's go was revealed i mean sometimes there's just like weird leaks that you know like just pop up out of nowhere and you don't know if they're real you don't know if it's fake but uh sometimes they do turn out to be legitimate i cannot wait till uh the day that gen 4 remakes do eventually happen and the the second they're announced the gen five people start i am such a gen five fan so i will be probably the loudest i'll be like okay where where's my where's my gen five remake yeah your uh your website's mascot is sawaddle i almost i feel like it was made for me like i just saw that and i was like okay this is it this is this is a representation of my website and of me personally maybe do you think with like go and the tcg and the anime and pretty much everything the pokemon company pumps out like this machine that they are do you think over the years the pokemon community has gotten more divided or more different it's definitely gotten bigger there's no denying it there with go alone um but it feels for me it feels slightly different than it did like five years ago yeah i mean i think it was much tighter knit and i think a lot of um from my generation of i don't know what my generation really is defined as but like i got in when pokemon forums were the thing you know like fans were not there was no twitter there was no um whatever so we were all on these you know forums and you kind of knew who people were and you know like we were using msn and aim and stuff to chat you know like outside of the forum so um i think you knew who people were a little bit more um whereas you know like everyday new twitter accounts are popping up and you really you don't have that same connection with other fans and it's so much more it's so much easier i think to interact with people um now because you don't have to register for a specific website based around a specific uh you know pokemon theme so there's just such a lower barrier uh to enter these online conversations now i think um but i like some people do think like pokemon fans are super toxic and stuff and i have to say that i think there are just there's just toxicity in everywhere in all fandoms um and you know like it's some people pigeonhole you know like gamers are toxic or pokemon fans of dogs but it's it's truly like kind of the nature of i think the internet and what it's evolved into because any fandom and for me i'm a huge fan of the um drag queen show rupaul's drag race and it's just amazing if you dig into that um fandom which is you know it's got a lot of gay people it's got a lot of trans people you know like there's female fans there's male fans um and it is so toxic you know like so it's the exact opposite of like the kind of this white male gamer stereotype of toxicity um and so like it's really kind of opened my eyes that i think there's a there's a larger problem and it's probably you know it does it it kind of needs to be addressed but you know like it's it's hard you know i think i don't know i hope that we as community can be a good example for other different fandoms i think the national dex issue kind of had a really maybe a negative impact on the way maybe other gamers saw the pokemon fandom but i really hope that we can be kind of a a positive force for good so that's what i that's what i try to promote when i'm not like picking on cerebe yeah well i think that's that's all that's all we have i mean i could i could probably keep you but i know i know you're busy i'm busy i'm a busy guy cool uh well if uh our
