how do i start this show what's up everyone welcome to another episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host sbj episode 424 i think actually what's wrong with you that's not how you start the show because you're supposed to get the number wrong oh yes well i got the how do i start the show that's wrong threw off the number thing that i got right i'm here now that you're a top chef is this just your secondary gig yup yup i've cooked some chicken uh and uh greg watched me cook said chicken i did well i wasn't there the entire time wait did anybody get salmonella no no yeah meat thermometer it's very impressive but i still don't understand why you were asking chat personal cooking questions what do you mean personal like how do you how do you put your chicken in oil how do you bread your chicken like these are ages long fights there are to this day gangs of chefs that meet at 2 a.m with raw chicken cutlets and just battle it out in back alley kitchens over tin can fires we we can argue about this but will is also here i choose not to cook i don't either is what the podcast has really become three pokemon fans that all dislike cooking it's the great not minnesota get together uh so i did buy a bunch of junk to eat in honor of the state fair and i will be eating it after this did you do the train the whatever they called the parade the car parade no we so we looked at what the offerings were and the fact they had made twenty dollars and then get into the food parade what they were offering at the food parade was not as good as what's been popping up around the cities just like i don't want to pay 20 when i can go to all the places that i like except for the place that has the best chicken fingers they don't have an actual location they're only at the fair now i was going to say are you raising teens at the state fair that's no no so for the uninformed better better the minute no the minnesota state fair which is not happening organized like food vendors and you could get in your car and drive through the fairgrounds and stop at the food vendors but then also restaurants that would normally have had a stand that are not part of the auto parade are having state fair specials and there's this korean place up on i want to say university avenue in st yeah yeah uh that's it specializes in bibimbap and korean fried chicken my two favorite korean dishes and they're having state fair specialists yeah that's just maybe where i'm going for dinner tonight in the parking lot of my gym there's a corn dog stand and a cheese curd stand thursday i'm gonna go see uh we got tickets to actually go see the foreign art fine arts show so we'll be going and visiting that so that i get a little state fair in my life this week and here's the thing will here's the thing that kills me it's cold for state fair time you could have had the most comfortable state fair experience wow back the weather it's always it comes full circle i was trying to avoid mentioning the fact that i went out on my bike this morning and i was shivering because i was wearing my running shorts a long sleeve running shirt and i was like it's real cold out here ah always gonna love that if if you stopped asking us how our week was you stopped doing anything polite and small talky on this podcast you're like get to work get the podcast out talk about pokemon i'm we are bringing back the human touch steve okay yeah that's what people enjoy people like humanity instead of your robotic chicken cooking let me tell you combustion nightmare how humanity is the worst through me cooking on twitch number one is we had a sub goal where if i hit a certain amount of subs i would cook a meal the appeal to that is i hate cooking it's a disaster and people like to watch a disaster number two is the first time i cooked which was like six months ago we made pokemon poffins and they turned out awful we did irene wouldn't even eat them she threw them right away you killed the yeast uh i did you talked about that i didn't realize how hard yeast was to deal with but apparently everyone says that it's a living creature number two is i uh nick fine fellow who does all the music for the show got me a pokemon waffle maker for my wedding i am still surprised that that worked yeah it actually worked it was like a thinkgeek exclusive back before gamestop absorbed thinking went to my wife and i said i want to use this pokemon waffle maker and the only thing that i can think of that goes with waffles is chicken and i you know i you can't do a stream of just making waffles that would be a very short well boring stream the way you were making waffles you could have made plenty plenty of time the next time you're in the area remind we're going to go to black coffee and waffles because they serve everything except chicken with their waffles it's really delicious well we can go to uh revival and get actual chicken waffles too so this is this is the thing i've learned is that i always learn nothing ever i always thought look on twitch you always have the person in chat or the people in chat that are like why aren't you doing this why why does your why is your gastrodon maxed in speed it's supposed to be on trick you always have your backseat gamers but let me tell you people who backseat cookers are way worse than backseat gamers they're awful they have no clue i posted the the the recipe in the discord and uh like one of the stuff one of the things the recipe was fill up the frying pan a half inch with oil and everyone was losing their mind that there was too much oil or not enough oil it's in the recipe why would i not follow what the recipe says because you picked the wrong recipe we just talked about this back alley fights among chefs also here are three things that i want to bring up one oh here we go did you or did you not break your whisk in dry ingredients no no we were wait we were halfway through why are you whisking dry ingredients i was whispering that's a wooden spoon the look there didn't say what utensils was in the instructions because any intelligent person knows that you use the wooden spoon with the dry ingredients and the whisk is for whisking together wet ingredients it's an emulsifier the whisk got a lot of mileage that night that evening two do you actually know what a cheese grater is okay i don't want to reveal you don't have to this is a yes or no question yes i know what a cheese grater is okay this was not apparent on the stream watch the vod pkmcast at twitch yeah but i don't wanna okay three did you like what you made yeah yeah no it turned out good when you're done yeah you actually i you know i will say this at the end of the stream because i popped in and out for as much as you were doing controversial things which because everybody has an opinion how you fry everybody has an opinion how you bread the food actually looked really good i i will go on record saying i would have eaten what you made i appreciate that my wife ate it all yeah she liked it she texted me you know the only thing i wish i would have done is add a little more hot sauce to it yeah well that's a preference but you know that's controversial that was saying i was adding too much off the bet well this hot hot and spice level is 100 a preference thing you can't say that's too much or too little also for the record you can and people have throughout the ages had big glasses of buttermilk oh that is a drinkable liquid i don't think for like however many subs or bits i would have tried buttermilk it was a very awful smell i mean it's acidic milk you can make buttermilk by adding lemon juice to regular milk buttermilk it's like it's slightly curdled milk that's the whole point yeah well if you if you did not get to watch me cook in the kitchen that will be up on youtube on either i think wednesday or friday so we'll give you all the all the best highlights so instead of watching a four hour stream you can watch it video of you melting down because you you'll ask a question to walk away and 15 people answer and of course they all answer differently and then you get mad there's a lot of things on my stream that are like amplified like like i'm not actually mad or you know i'm not actually upset it's just like it's for the show it's for it's to be entertaining but there is there was a point in that stream where you saw my brain break in half where i i i thought to myself i'm just gonna hit the end stream button and throw all of this away and uh go to bed uh that that did almost happen okay pokemon of the week uh please i've barely finished writing it wait you're talking a person has such a bad week i forgot to post questions of the week so we're there already peeps all right well we have uh we have two big things to talk about this episode uh one is pokemon masters one is pokemon go uh they both added new stuff for the most part i don't know well one is pretty liked i guess and one is pretty not liked so let's start with the pokemon go which is the controversial stuff i guess number one there's two things pokemon go i'll get the first thing out of the way here wait let's get the real pokemon go controversy out of the way first will anderson's not getting a victini until the regular people can get the victini oh and i cannot believe that that happened yeah niantic no no because i looked it up and basically if you did not log in to pokemon go on the sunday of pokemon go fest you do not get the research question oh because the server didn't assign it to your i'm not gonna assign doesn't the server waiter reception whoever i don't care that is the fundamental rule that they did not advertise ahead of time or they did and i didn't read it so you opened up pokemon go on saturday got that quest line but you didn't open up pokemon go on sunday i don't think i opened it on saturday either i may have i don't know but i certainly didn't on sunday because that's the day i was doing the wedding stuff what's your controversy beat that all right well first off pokemon.com join go battle league bat sorry join go battle night for great rewards in pokemon go battle for stardust and glory during pokemon go battle night taking place september 24th this is like a month away battle night kicks off september 24th 6 pm local time concludes at the stroke of midnight on friday go battle night will occur exclusively with go battle league providing the opportunity to participate in a maximum of 20 set of 5 of 20 sets of five battles earn double stardust for individual wins at the end of the each set of five battles you will we rank up this is the perfect time to fine tune your lineup uh use this opportunity to leverage your faster charge tms uh that's that's it it's just they're still go battle league is not gbl not not the not the most stable product out there i will say so that's the first bit of news alone raichu in research breakthrough for uh september train will end on september 10th so plenty of time for heatran then cresselia will show up for a week then articuno will show up for a week which is september 18th and then zapdos will show up on september 25th and then nothing after that so i'm assuming well trace will be after that it'd be really weird to do articuno and zapdos uh my assumption is why articuno zapdos and probably maltrace are coming back is to advertise for the crown tundra well see that's what i that's why i asked when they were doing it because i was going to say if it was like october or november when we're going to get the alternate versions of them then that would make sense but yeah if we're just getting the you would want to run the normal ones first and then the alternative ones closer no okay but i would assume that you run articuno's after a small trace and then in the game at like put the outfit in or advertise or advertise somehow and then like we'll we'll get a trailer that week or we'll get a that's what i'm guessing i don't know okay this is the this is the the big thing it's it's arrived mega evolution oh what is that that sounds cool i had a pokemon professor tell me about how he heard about it from his friend sycamore and then he gave it all different names because come on dude you can now see some of your favorite pokemon in their mega evolved form by you utilizing mega evolution and pokemon go mega evolution enables certain pokemon to reach an additional evolutionary stage and gain incredible power for a limited time select pokemon can mega evolve using the newly discovered resource called mega energy you can collect the mysterious substance by completing mega raids which are raid battles featuring mega evolved pokemon the faster you defeat the raid boss the more mega energy you receive you can mega evolve any of your venusaur charizard blastoise b drill once you have enough of the corresponding energy uh plus some of these pokemon will appear in raids after you mega evolve a pokemon that pokemon will require less mega energy to mega evolve each time they're after mega evolved pokemon will stay in their mega forms for a limited time doesn't say here but it's four hours and while your pokemon is mega evolved you'll be able to do the following with them you can battle in raids you can battle in gyms you can battle team go rocket you can battle your friends you can watch it follow you on the map in the buddy thing and you can take a snapshot of your mega evolved pokemon be sure to open the app for a new mega evolution themed special research a mega discovery join professor willow as they learn more about the mega evolution phenomenon the month of september will be filled of events celebrating the introduction of mega pokemon so from september 1st through the 7th complete as many mega raids as you can gather energy to evolve your pokemon uh from the september 11th through the 17th hone your battle skills with mega evolved pokemon take part in gym battles uh team go rocky battles trainer battles excluding go battle league and then from the september 22nd to the 28th become buddies with your mega pokemon uh remember to take snapshots etc so so are all the mega forms already in the game in the code yes but not you can there's only five pokemon four pokemon that can mega evolve one of those pokemon having two different forms which is charizard of course so there are five different mega pokemon you can obtain right now bee drill is technically the free one through the limited research so i just got best buddy with my gardevoir and i cannot mega evolve it no you not yet this is the this is garbage the go community from reddit to twitter to wherever else you want to look doesn't seem completely satisfied with this new mechanic if i could sum it up in a single phrase they they would say it's very money grabby you mean pokemon go is money grabby i've never heard such a thing what pokemon product has been ever been money grabby it's all geared towards fun first i have a lot to say about mega evolution but what have you guys done any mega raids have you a mega evolved what is your thoughts i did did i do a mega blast toys with you yeah i think so and then i didn't catch it i spent 100 coins i didn't catch the pokemon there you go i've seen the mega egg as around but i have not done any i'm so past the idea of megas at this point yeah that their introduction is not interesting well you like mangas i do like megas uh i don't particularly care for mega venus or mega blastoise or the the mega charizards i'd like the megas that i care about yeah i want my mega sable eye and i want my mega gardevoir you know and i'd also like a little more focus on unova before we just so casually move on you know is dead long live unova no younova's dead long live halos that's that's yeah that's the reality here okay so i ideally you need about 200 mega energy to mega evolve a pokemon of your choice but the mega energy is specific to the raids you do so i'm gonna i i okay i'm gonna interrupt here to say i do agree that in this time of not going out having them in raids does lend itself to being money grabbed before the remote raid passed yeah like that's kind of i would assume that that was like the the thought process though right we need we need to do something during the summer that doesn't involve people walking around and people like remote raid passes so let's tie this new feature to the thing that people like i mean but walking around isn't the problem people can walk around peacefully and not be near people all they want this is i don't know well maybe everywhere else in the world that isn't the united states maybe that's true think that there's something wrong with mega evolution but i don't agree with the complaints so i don't know how to like i don't know how to say this because it sounds like i'm defending it but i i just i don't like it or maybe i don't care for it okay what what are the complaints okay i i will i will attempt to defend said complaints okay so you so if you want mega charizard you gotta do mega charizard raids and when you complete a raid you get anywhere between uh like 40 to 60 or whatever probably realistically like 50 mega energy okay so it takes even if you're not super fast it takes a person four to five charizard raids to then have enough energy to mega evolve charizard you can make a charizard you may evolve whichever charizard you want you got a shiny one from community day with blast burn you can pick that one to mega evolve you got a perfect charizard 100 iv you can mega evolve that one with the 200. once you mega evolve it it will last for four hours and you can do everything we listed above battle team rocket walk around with it take a picture of it do more raids and then and then it d mega evolves like it does in the x and y and stuff and then you have to spend 50 energy to mega evolve it again at any point so 200 initially to start it and then 50 for future uses so the complaint is i gotta spe i gotta spend money on raids i gotta get the energy i get the charizard it only lasts this amount of time i gotta use the charizard get more energy to do it again so it's like this cycle that they're going the complaint i would say is probably the cycle right because it's not permanent yeah i mean that's if if raids were easier to do right if raids in this current time where i can go down there i can go to the mall of america which is open and just always have raids available and gather around 20 people and quickly burn through this raid i think that system would be fine right now for people who are stuck uh or anybody in rural areas who are hoping somebody invites them you know that's five dollars for a four hour increase and then as a dollar each time you want to do it after which ain't great like that's five dollars to do it once and then a dollar every time thereafter that's we're approaching real real expensive territory there and it's like yeah you're paying to activate unlocked i mean it's just as bad as like like you've unlocked this shirt that you can now pay to buy right it's just like you're paying to unlock their well i mean functionality you're also paying for eggs you're paying for stardust you're paying for lucky eggs pay for none of that stuff i mean you are getting some you you're getting side benefits sure but that that happens with anything right like anytime you do any anything in that game you're getting side benefits this that is the incentive to keep you playing the game you can't look at that and say well the price of this is offset by that because that those freebies come with everything if you do a raid with somebody you don't even have to have the mega but if somebody brings the mega charizard to a mega venusaur raid and they tell me to i'm bringing mega charizard please pick a fire pokemon and then because that person brings mega charizard we get the venusaur raid done faster and then i get more energy because it was completed faster so i would say there is definitely a side benefit to which you have to organize outside of the app well every once we can't do because we're all doing remote we're all organizing though it's even easier between the discord and the slack and however else people their facebook groups or their discords it's easier for you i know yeah i'm like the the most organization i get is i get a text message it's like mega blast yeah because i've already organized it well i've made it as easy as possible for you i've i've done it still still didn't catch that manga blastoise so i wasted a hundred coins on like five minutes of broken phone screen yeah yeah hold on nothing great i think the money conversation is important the the actual cork mechanic of mega i think is it's it's what i have been saying for years of mega pokemon are not particularly interesting they are interesting in the sense of they look awesome i think they all look incredible with the exception of like maybe mega aerodactyl not not as cool looking because it has this weird goatee thing and it's kind of gross but every mega pokemon dare you attack brooklyn or aerodactyl that is rude brooklyn aerodynamic williamsburg aerodactyl i think all the mega pokemon look great and i think that if you were specifically a competitive person and you you played in the xy sun and moon omega ruby alpha sapphire actual format even let's go pikachu let's go eevee and you used mega pokemon there was value there as there are is value to any other held item like leftovers focus ash rindo berry because at the end of the day in the main series games mega evolutions was a held item yeah but no one was playing x and y and being like ah youngster joey's here with a rattata i got a mega evolve my kangaskhan no because it took too long and yeah we're gonna one shot is rattata anyways no one is like sosing in ultrasound ultramoon and being like i gotta bring out my mega garden for for this sos hunt like no like a normal gameplay never involved you mega evolving sure there's probably an exception where you were like you were frustrated you stubbed your toe you ran into trainer last and you mega evolved your blastoise to like one shot her skinny because you were upset you stubbed you i'm sure that situation existed i'm sure there's one person listening to this podcast that said they mega evolved their banette every single battle through x and y i'm sure that person or omega ruby of zephyr i'm sure that person exists but no one really used mega evolution unless you were testing it out you were running maybe the elite four or a gym leader and or you did vgc like normal gameplay stuff throughout the game just it just didn't happen it's it's like this weird mechanic that people have nostalgia for but that was specifically tied to only battles does anybody really have nostalgia for megas yeah every national dexter in the entire world that was upset that vegas were cut absolutely i mean okay so i i will actually say this i mean okay i'm going to say they didn't have things for i was i would argue that those national debtors have completionists they want it in the decks they don't if megas never existed they would still be upset that they that things weren't in the deck that's not a i love megas that's a i love completion argument i'm gonna posit an alternative and i will say why i am disappointed about mega evolution and kind of where it is was however uh i wanted more megas i wanted more pokemon to get mega evolutions and the fact that they just said we're not doing this anymore and it's like the ones you got are the ones you got and i'm sorry like your favorite pokemon didn't get a mega evolution and it never will now that's where my disappointment lies i just like have to mourn the loss right that there will be never be a mega fig tv there might be more megas in the future i mean we went how many games without any baby pokemon we went like three games without a single baby and we got a new baby and sword and shield that's that's fine anything is possible yes yes but i live in the world of now i live in the world of today and for today there will no longer be any meg evolutions and they i mean honestly dynamaxing giganta maxing that is the replacement for mega evolution and any pokemon can dynamics but right here's here's here's the new well except for zamasu when are we when is every pokemon gonna get a gigantic max for him i think the main i'm not answering that question i think the main thing that's been a coward there are two things that benefited vegas competitive battling which pokemon go is lacking right now and the anime that is it those are the two things mega evolution in the anime super sick awesome sweet loved it incredible would love it they were also able to introduce new pokemon designs without expanding the pokedex yes yeah yeah yeah yeah your favorite thing ever as much as i love pokemon go it doesn't have that so when you introduce a mechanic that was strategically used in high-level competitive battles and that's it that's all it was used for i mean you could argue that you used it through the story but you're just one-shotting things and you probably could have one-shot them without mega evolving you have raids you have team rocket and you have go battle league and that's it right and it doesn't work in go battle league i i was i'm sick of hearing like well when they do bring it to go battle league how about they fix go battle league first before we talk about when they bring it to go battle league because it's been about a year and go battle league is still terribly broken to the point where niantic put out a press release a week ago saying we're really sorry we're still trying to fix it so i don't want to hear about mega evolution coming to go battle league because it's still broken we're not even close to having that conversation yet so all that leads to is raids and team rocket i how what how do you hey ray i don't even look at my phone when i'm doing a raid how would megas make that better it's just like i'm trying to like see the complaint but i'm also trying to see the the like what people want because the raids are so one note and that's like i like raids it's fine i think they're like i like doing them even though i'm not looking at my screen but i never in a million years thought mega evolution was going to change my raid experience i think i'm adding the timer is cool i think rewarding players for doing it faster is like a good challenge in itself that's like again like monster hunter has that you don't really get anything for killing a monster faster in monster hunter but it's still nice to be like oh man i killed this great jaggerist in seven minutes and then the next time you do it man i killed it in six minutes oh now i killed it in five minutes and 50 seconds like that is i'm glad that you i'm glad that you brought that up hey folks i'm playing monster hunter generations ultimate again hit me up if you want to go kill some gourmet galas okay i'm down um do you think no listen this is this is real talk do you think that there's some aspect of it that is and let's go for the pokemon go player who is only a pokemon go player never played a traditional console handheld pokemon game never played tcg only ever played pokemon go do you think that there might be having some argument of this is the new thing i want to have the new thing and now there's a financial barrier for me to be able to get the new thing and that's where their aggravation is coming from no this is their problem i say they as like the hardcore pokemon go player i i can i can relate to this so the complaint i saw that stood out to me the most was they're frustrated that they are they're not frustrated that they're spending money they're frustrated that that they don't feel like it's a completionist thing i think the example was like i spent 80 dollars to get a 100 iv perfect rayquaza and that i was done right i did it i got what i wanted and they don't feel that with mega evolution i think that's valid yeah i think it is too i think it's you know i'm i'm not one to get a hundred ivs but people have personal goals right like i keep getting more xp and pokemon go not because it does anything but i just like seeing that number go up so i understand personal goals i think the complaints around it are just wrong and i do agree that i don't think mega evolution is great but i don't think it's because of the implementation implement i don't think it's the way they implement it i just think that mega evolution is not particularly interesting if you think it's both really yeah so let's say you were a free-to-play player or you spent you you try to spend as little money as possible those people exist and you just wanted mega evolution for the decks it is completely possible to do this right if it takes let's just assume it takes five raids to get 200 energy and you wanted five pokemon for your decks two charizard blastoise venus or beedrill bee drills free so you only need four you do five raids a week you get one raid pass a day you skip two days you know take your weekend to rest but you can get charizard week one charizard week two blastoise week three venusaur week four in a month you can get all the mega evolution without spending a penny so i don't think there's this huge money cost they're asking for if you just want to complete your decks now if you do want mega evolution to do raids i don't see where the money there is either right you're already doing the raids you probably will get the the energy from it you will then spend the energy to do raids like i'm i'm not sure the people complaining is probably maybe the middle road people that are willing to spend like twenty dollars to try to get like a shiny heatran but they're not willing to spend like a hundred but they're like willing to spend time about yourself yeah you're talking i spend zero dollars i mean i i hate the fact that i've had to do remote raid passes a lot and like half the time when you're like do you want to do this i'm like no i don't want to spend the money because it's just not worth it but going back to the free thing if i if i do five raids a week for free and i can get all the megas currently for my decks which is what i personally want to do because i don't plan on using them in raids particularly unless it's maybe like a raid day where they do the three-hour things i can do that for free in a week and before anyone says like well remote raid passes stuff like that you can literally apply that to the last four years of pogo i don't want to hear that argument of like well i don't have i live in a suburb i don't have like that is all of four years of pogo that is not specific to mega evolution that is literally every raid since raids have started it's not exclusive to this issue i mean the thing that we're the having to constantly get energy thing just it's weird to me like i could see much like in the game if you had to get x amount of pieces and then you got the stone and then you could choose to evolve it from then on that would make a little bit more sense to me than oh i have to get i have to generate energy to to do this thing i already did even though it's less i hate yeah i hate that crap i can see that aggravation right because yeah in the game you get the mega stone and then you can mega evolve your pokemon as much as you want yeah right why can't i just get a mega stone in pokemon go for this particular pokemon and then i can make it evolve it whenever i want oh because niantic's not gonna make any money that way but everything in pokemon go is a grind you wanna you wanna level up your gyarados well grind out stardust but my gyarados once leveled up i don't then have to power it with 15 more gyarados energy because it fell back to a message sure yeah yeah that's true like once that once that thing is done once i have done that grind that that grind is done this is hey we've done this grind now you get a lesser grind every time you want to do it that doesn't feel great to me even if it was like if you do a hundred mega blastoise raids and then you get the mega stone because you've done it a hundred times that's still better than you always have to do the energy give you give them something to aim for right well they did say that energy was going to come to different things they didn't they they have said that like there will be other ways to get energy that is not raid specific unless i'm wrong i'm almost positive they said that better be in those gifts i'm sending out them gifts every day but this is this is the thing niantic is every niantic in the pokemon company is always done right like what was super rare that people cared about you know four years ago it was dratini like it was it was mind-blowing to find a dratini and then they did tortini community today and people were like all right durtini's done never need another dratini again even though there are plenty of players that still needed routine now any time dratini shows up it's just nothing but like oh all i'm seeing is dratini this is like a thing that people were sought after for the longest time the same with melton when we first got milton you could open the box once every like 10 days then they were like you can open it once every 10 days but we doubled the spawns and then like two months later they're like you can open it once every week two months after that they were like you can open it every three days like this is the cycle of pokemon go so it's very hard for me to be like this is this is mega evolution implemented in this game is bad well i do think it's bad but i i also know that like they're trying to add some length to their game so people don't finish it in two days and then comp then i have a different complaint of there's nothing to do right they have to find this balance from you before but it's really easy to look at them as being the same block and they're generally not the same people that are complaining about the same things yeah yeah that's true unmask when you're like oh god all we all we ever do is hear from pokemon fans that they hate this or they hate that they're generally different people that have very different complaints and you'll never you know it's really hard to keep them separate because a lot of you a lot of people are just often yelling at you and you're like i don't even know who you are and i can't i can't i gotta get away but this i i would have to agree even if i can get energy more easily later i still don't like the fact that it's not a one and done process i still don't like the fact that i have to generate 50 energy if i want to use this again it but doesn't personally affect me i will probably never collect them or i will i don't care um i don't care about collecting it's not hard same attitude greg thank you but i can see people who who do and that it is a frustrating implementation i mean it i think what gets frustrating is when you can see the mechanics of greed behind the process right like remote raids at least doesn't feel as bad because they needed a solution to allow us to do something in a unique period and like that felt like you're answering a need this is just we need to a extend the life of the game and b get you to pay more money there's so much tunnel vision with raids though people act like they're paying a dollar to get just pure pure energy and you're not right when you're doing a mega egg raid weird thing to say or if you're doing a five-star raid you're getting way more than the opportunity of finding of the one thing they want and i guess this is the frustrating part that i see is people are you know in in the sense of like heatran i i think i ended up spending like 25 right i did 25 raids and i got my shiny heatran and i was happy you know i in the in the sense of doing heatran not only did i have 25 opportunities to catch heatran one of those being shiny i'm also getting experience i'm also getting stardust i'm also getting rare candy i'm also getting charged tms like i am getting so much from spending that dollar that i think most people kind of disregard and don't see that right i agree with you 100 percent right before go fest i had 770 some rare candy and i needed to spend that rare candy because otherwise gofest is gonna be awful because my bag was gonna be full so i put 300 rare candy into like i don't know deoxys or something and then when i was doing the access raids after go fest i was back up to 800 rare candy and i didn't even realize it and i was like this is awesome i mean not awesome because i ended up well like awesome in the sense of like i forgot that raids give you so much rare candy and now i have more rare like there's more than than just like oh i'm spending a dollar to get 50 mega charizard candy or energy but i mean that's fine but that's also saying like i ordered a pizza and you gave me a free bucket of mushrooms i i don't care i'm never going to eat those mushrooms and now i have something that i have to deal with and throw them away like you can say oh you get all these great things with it if you never use them they are useless and worthless they are clogging up your bag space a crap you don't want and you you play a lot of various aspects of pokemon go and that's great a lot of people don't a lot of people have hundreds of raid candies that they will never ever use that is not going to interest them so that free thing isn't worth anything to them they don't care so you can't use that bonus as a value add if it's not actually adding any value to them and and i will say the what you have to keep in mind which is like what what nobody ever wants to keep in mind it's the same thing as what you have to keep in mind when you walk into a casino what you are paying for when you get a raid pass is an opportunity to do a raid you are not paying for a quad pokemon you are not paying for any guaranteed rewards because the rewards are randomized all you are paying for is the opportunity to do a raid so if financially this is a question you need to answer for yourself the value of doing a raid which is all you are paying for is not sufficient then you need to not spend the money because right the value for me in doing raids is one i can complain about steve yeah which gives me endless pleasure and joy or if i'm in person with people then my value of doing raids is driving around milwaukee with my friends trying or going at steve's bachelor party driving around the dells yeah or where going walking around chicago right that is nothing that i obtained from those raids has any value but the experience of being with my friends and that is what i am paying for yeah valid yeah i i agree i mean they uh so but going back to the raid thing they they took venusaur charizard blastoise they gave them the chance of being shiny i do think that there are different levels of raids they did get rid of two and four star raids by the way we didn't mention that in the news but there are only one star raids three star raids and five star raids now which i think when are they going to add a six star then learn from pokemon masters which which i think is i think is the right thing to do right you know you anyone could solo a one and two star pretty easily you could you know if you if you did invest your stardust and your rare candy and your charged tms you could probably do a three star pretty easily um very hard to do a four star but if you had another person or two easy to do a four star so i think the consolidation of just having one three and five is great but i i do think there are raids that have specific value for example would i spend a dollar on heatran whether it's my local heatran or a heatran you know out that somebody is inviting me to yes uh although i would argue that people were more willing to spend that dollar on rayquaza because we know that rayquaza is one of the best dragon type attackers and flying type attackers right but would i spend a dollar on shinks which is a one star yeah actually probably because i i want more shinx candy i want the chance of shiny shanks easy enough to do i can do it in 30 seconds i don't need to call anyone or text anyone so would i spend a dollar on shanks yes would i spend a dollar on heatran yes would i spend a dollar on mega charizard yeah probably i would probably if it was if i had a free raid pass i would do it a hundred percent if somebody invited me to it and they were like hey we really need a fourth or a fifth can you help us out yeah totally because if i'm ever in that situation i would want that person to return the favor would i spend a dollar on cladel or machamp or any of these other garbage raids that exist no like no i wouldn't can you do an infographic of which raids are worth a dollar and which ones are not because i'm i'm not in this world but the the dollar for mega evolution you're you're you're getting the rare candy you're getting the experience you're getting the stardust you're getting a chance to catch blastoise venus or charizard which most people probably don't need but you are getting the chance of catching a shiny version of them and you're getting the mega candy i don't know how they make that dollar worth more to you and i i don't even i i think the actual complaint probably comes down to spending energy to have it mega evolve again but i also think there's probably a mechanical thing of well if we don't have something to trigger then people are just going to run megas all the time maybe they and i'm assuming they don't want that right i'm assuming they just don't want people to use megas all the time slash they want magus to feel special and there's a balance there and i don't think they got the balance right which is my complaint which is also my complaint but i don't know how they fix that balance the other thing i saw is people were frustrated that the mega evolution lasted for four hours and i saw some people suggesting they should last for 24 hours why who's playing pokemon go 24 like who is playing pokemon go for more than four hours and like well like even on a raid day that's when i would be like hey i'm gonna pop mega venusaur we're gonna take out some uh milotics uh i'm going to run mega venusaur for the next four hours yeah i can see that situation i can't see a situation where it's like 12 hours long and i'm doing like one raid every 12 hours and i'm like well good thing i got mega like only the most hardcore of p like the people who are doing you know a hundred plus raids a week are probably want that but also like what rates are they i just like i don't think the four hours is actually the problem even though i keep seeing people say like oh it should be longer than four hours like are you actually playing pokemon go that much in an entire day like i play pokemon go every day don't get me wrong and i normally play like if it's like a saturday and i'm going for a walk that's normally like an hour to two hours if there's an event like tuesday night i'm normally playing for an hour two hours i don't think there's ever been a situation where i'm like let's play for four hours on a not like there's nothing happening today when we're recording this on a sunday i don't think i'm just being like let's play four hours today greg like that's not happening unless maybe there was an event so i don't think that like the four-hour limit is the actual problem we should be arguing about i just don't like okay here here's the question if you don't hit the full four hours like if you shut the game down is it four hours of play time or is it just four hours period it's four hours it's just like a lucky egg you turn it on and whether you're playing or not the thing is clicking down so in that way i could see last the argument for lasting 24 hours because they're not saying i'm playing for 24 hours it's if i play for an hour and then i have to go to do a bunch of stuff tomorrow morning i would like to be able to come up and play for my hour or play for my 15 minutes in the morning and still have that available to me yeah agreed right yeah but like if i only played half an hour you need mega venusaur on for like one raid and then like seven hours later you're like i gotta get this other raiden with mega venusaur like that's just you can do any raid without mega venus or like we've established that but we've also established the only thing people like collecting for showing it off to people i mean that's that's the only part of it they would like to have it in their next raid the next morning for a whole new group of people to see yeah i can't argue yeah they want to show it off yeah i guess i can't argue with that i don't think mega evolution is great but i i don't know how i would fix it though yeah i don't know either i mean i well i would make it a one-and-done thing for sure i do think if you're just trying to complete them for your decks i think it's very easy to do it free you can get it done in less than a month i wouldn't stress about it too much i i don't know it's interesting yeah yeah yeah but yeah it sounded like that entire time i was defending it but i i just i i also just don't care about it like i've been no rush to get these megas well let's take a break when we come back we'll do a little bit of masters and our pokemon and question of the week we'll be right back we are back from our break finally we're back to normality one mobile game to the next gardenscapes updates uh i'm really not a fan of the disco season i just i don't enjoy disco um and i'm completely skipping the whole decorate your garden italian style but i'm excited for what's coming up next because we're at the four year anniversary of garnish gardenscapes now so i'm i'm sure there's some good stuff coming is gardens escaped just like homescapes well yeah except you're outside not inside is garden escapes like the hgtv version of pokemon masters uh sure except there's no property brothers so on gardenscapes do you have to figure out how to rescue the butler from the oncoming shark that is listen listen you take your i am not the company okay i'm just here to talk about the actual game not their horrible horrible advertising tactics that literally every other game company has now assumed as their own tactics if you if you haven't noticed my friend i have it's awful uh pokemon masters news uh there's a great big one-year uh anniversary update uh uh full disclosure steve is partnered with dina dna not dina i was gonna say speaking of one it was speaking of anniversary speaking of mega evolution a game that does feature mega evolution a game that completely revolves around battles uh this is off pokemon.com pokemon masters is one year old to celebrate this auspicious milestone that's a big word a wide variety of exciting new features that players will love greg are coming these will include a six star ex sync pair the new champion stadium some awesome debuts of sink pair scouts but not last but not least a title change to reflect all of the additions and enhancements that the game has received in this past year that's right pokemon masters is now pokemon masters ex players will receive 3 000 gems when they log into the game so don't forget to claim your special gift before though that though check out some more details accompanying pokemon masters we went through a lot of these last week uh the two changes that they did we didn't talk about last week and i recall greg that we both said that it felt like it was a little bit underwhelming you know they did do a lot but i just felt like they should have done more for the one year uh they yeah they added some stuff uh so they maybe dna listening to the show uh when you do a and you do a 10-pole now uh you get 11 poles instead i don't think that's a permanent change i think that's i think it's temporary and still doesn't feel good when you get 11 3 stars still stinks that happened to you although it'll probably happen to me i haven't done an 11 pole yet i know a person that has uh getting sigma suit leaf broke my streak of that was my 50th pull of all threes like i had gotten 353 stars in a row and finally leaf broke my broke my terrible tears no 10 chance of getting a five star yeah that ten percent is on every choice right like you you are the person that sits on twitch and screams about shiny odds yeah no i'm just giving you a hard time and i stayed up 50 pulls like only getting three stars is also a percent chance so we talked about last week how there was um that cigna suit cynthia was like the new character and then on september 3rd there's like a silhouette of like new character coming and then it's like september 10th there's another new character so a lot of people guessed that this might have been leaf and blue but they're not uh but leaf and blue came so uh they brought back red leaf is now in the game and a cigna suit leaf i'm sorry i forgot that leaf has been in the game with an eevee and i pulled a leaf but it was not the signa suit leaf everybody forgot that there was the bad version even i forgot i'm like wait there's another version oh it's the one that nobody likes and nobody cares about uh and then cigna suit blue is now in the game and there's a banner for lance i'm not why is there a banner for lance right now because people missed it because of the kanto well because of the kanto championship oh because of the champion that makes sense and then there's cynthia so we're supposed to still get another new character soon and then another character after that uh so there's there is a lot i guess like holding leaf and blue was probably a nice surprise i mean surprised me yeah i it's weird that they're not on the same banner is that's what i was gonna ask you is this so there are three banners if you don't know what a banner is in pokemon masters you can choose a a loot box let's say to open so one loot box will include red and then a bunch of other old five stars and then another loot box will open will have leaf and then all the older five stars so if you open a leaf loot box you have no chance of pulling red just like if you open a red loot box you have no chance of pulling signa suit leaf but leaf red and blue are two percent so a 1 in 50 chance of getting in said loot box is it better that they split them out because if you don't care about red and blue which there probably are some people that only care about leaf that's good you can only pull on leaf then whereas if they were all in one you might not get it yeah i would say that that was true if you didn't need to pull duplicates to power them up in this game right and having them on their own separate banner means the odds of getting something from from that banner are even lower so if they were two percent each on one banner it would feel like hey i've got a solid chance of actually pulling one of these characters in this method it's like i don't have a great chance of pulling either of these characters plus i have to choose which one i need which means most people are just gonna stick on red because it's already been released and you have the best chance of getting duplicates which is kind of a garbagey way of releasing them do you really think you need to pull three i mean i've just pulled one of a lot of things and i've been pretty fine playing the game yeah you can until we see fully how expert championship plays out sure but there's no doubt that having a fully fleshed out five uh five sink level is way better than having a one yeah sure yeah the numbers do go up i mean like look at the skyla problem and you know that that's you know it's a problem of how they made the game with the six star possibility well they added the one new thing where um you don't need to pull like five sink pairs now you can like merge that new currency into a forced sink pair i don't remember what that's called though is it the type thing maybe the the type there's a lot of moving parts and masters there's too many moving parts and masters see and and it's still real time just make it not real time no no no no no no the real time just turn autobattle on no then what is the point of playing the game and autobahn is still bad i'm sending my robot after their robot no that's not fun you know sometimes you sometimes you're like i know i can beat this i'm gonna turn on all the battle run to the bathroom come back oh it's done yeah no no no no no i mobile games are my reason for going to the back is garden escapes is gardenscapes turn based i don't think so it certainly is it's a match three you take your turns yes it's type skills right type skills is what yeah raises them yeah i'm pretty sure yeah right so you don't need to pull three you don't need to pull a million scalas now well i mean scala was free and then they did the scala event but like me i i only have one of l i only have one skyla and skyla has been vip mvp on my team and i only have one of it but there's a way to get skyla to three no i have three skyles because i have i have most of her sink grid but i could get her to five by not pulling any but by merging some currency that they have now which is new yeah yeah the types the type thing they brought back the mew and professor oak event yep which was very easy to get professor oak to 125. i don't know why they brought that back or like why it was auto like my bingo win they brought back yeah professor oak your bingo card was like automatically done right because you already did it yeah um the reason why they brought it back again is because the kanto champions cup right like it's all kanto-based because that's the first champions cup yeah i mean it's the first sigma suits it's like it's the big kanto event so they've brought back all the cantoey things i think they said that you get a total of like 7 600 gems because of the anniversary so you get the 3 000 bonus and then if you log in every day you get like another 3 600 when it all eventually adds up um and then you still get your 150 a week from you know 50 on tuesdays and 100 on fri whatever the that daily login is yeah you get 200 stamina guaranteed which is also part of the event which is made made it feel a lot like when they first rolled out stamina yep it's like it's like it brought you back to when it was fun and they're gonna take it away and there is a one-year anniversary gem special but they seem identical to the lead up so i'm a little bummed that they weren't allowed i was hoping it was going to be slightly cheaper but great they're not great prices it was the same as the lead-up uh which is a little bit of a bummer um yeah do you wanna we we talked about this on on stream last night greg uh yeah of gems being expensive so right now you can you can get 14 000 gems for 80 usd uh which is just which is about 50 pulls a little short of 50 poles i think it's like 47 poles i guess technically 50 is it with the with the um that is their that's their discounted rate you could buy that three times if you wanted to which is over 200 but what uh we can compare this to we compared this to dragalgia loss which is an another nintendo i i guess not yes shouldn't say another nintendo we do know that nintendo owns a stake in the pokemon company the pokemon company pokemon masters you know dna uh the closest thing i think we can compare it to yeah maybe fire emblem heroes as well but what what is our what is our gem difference there so we were comparing non-discounted prices right so being able to do a one a ten poll in pokemon masters is 28.99 being able to do the same 10 poll in regalia lost is 23.99 okay so there's a not discounted so there's a five dollar difference which what i suggested and i think you agreed with was that is the five dollar pokemon tax correct it is a five dollar pokemon tax the the difference i think the reason why so here's the biggest difference between the two games i never feel like i have to purchase anything in regalia lost they are very steady and i would say generous but they are more generous than pokemon masters at giving you gems that you can stoop ten polls with so i usually can do one full ten pull with a guarantee of getting something good masters um like every two weeks just by playing the game you get a steady clip of the gyms coming they for completing their existing events for completing their story for login bonuses they keep you steadily in gems so that you never feel like oh this banner is going to go by and i won't have enough to do a 10-pole to try to get something decent from it masters doesn't do that masters also calls them the same thing which is super frustrating but masters is very stingy with giving you free gems to do polls so you could and the fact that you're not guaranteed something decent on their ten poll so they are very much on this drip feed well i'll pull once on this banner and hope that it's good and then i'll wait you know two weeks because like monday and you know tuesday friday you get 150 it takes two weeks to get 300 to do one poll it it it's really they're really not great at making the poll system feel good and it's more expensive do you think guaranteeing one four star in a ten poll is is makes it feel any better though yeah absolutely all right because you're getting because four stars are so much better than three stars right like those pairs are just simply going to make the game better and easier to use and it's also going to allow you to get your favorite four star pair if you're getting duplicates up to a five star like it makes that process better without guaranteeing getting a a four star you have to rely on luck to get one that you've already maxed out to get enough of the power up thing to be able to turn somebody into a five star and so those those upgrades seem almost unachievable because of how slow that system goes whereas in the other one i'm like oh i really like this character they're very powerful and because i've pulled a couple of times and had a bunch of duplicates i can promote them right now i want to be able to promote them immediately i can get them to a five star and it unlocks an entire different like power up system which there's a bunch of different things indoli lost at least they do a good job of explaining them to you but like i feel that none of my poles are wasted because they're going into a generic pool and i can use them almost immediately but you are also guaranteed to get good things so like you just it just feels fun to always pull on their banners and that's something that masters lacks don't think that polls would get any cheaper although i i i i hope they keep the 11th pole i i think removing that is like if they keep the 11th pull that that solves the guaranteed four-star problem right because then there is a reason to pull on a tent right because they want an extra bonus yeah you want a reason to save although you could argue like well if i only pull single pole and i get you know sigma suit cynthia first try now i've just saved nine poles you could argue that i mean you could i mean but that goes back to the fact that that polling duplicates is generally bad in this game because you you don't have a you don't have a great conversion system in place to to make use of those duplicates and i was thinking of like i feel like there's no way they make any of this cheaper because like there's other games like apex legends where people that was like the biggest complaint for over a year for apex was the store is too expensive if you don't know apex legend is completely free uh if you want to spend money in it you can buy like gun skins or character skins and they're i'm not exaggerating it is about 18 to buy character skin all it does is change the way your character looks or 18 to change the the way your gun looks they don't not pay to win they don't do anything and i to myself you know we were talking about raid passes earlier and is like is a mega charizard worth a dollar i think yeah sure it is um i cannot maybe if i can maybe like one skin out of a thousand i'd be like heck yeah that's worth 18 bucks but i've never purchased a skin or a gun skin in that game because 18 for a skin is is i think outrageous i would maybe at most pay 10 but i'd probably be more willing to buy skins if they were five and how much is the skin worth in destiny uh i think destiny's well destiny doesn't happen they have armor how much have you paid oh well so emotes and the emotes were i think about five dollars a piece and i was buying a lot of the emotes because what if it was a pax west exclusive was the most i paid for that i think the most i've paid for uh emblem was like 20 25. that's more than 18. more than 18 yeah but in destiny i was dedicated to collecting every single thing destiny was like my space pokemon i was very dedicated to completing that that's true as much as i love apex i i there's not been a trigger where i felt compelled to collect all the skins for all the characters um i mean but this is like skin prices are not unusual like final fantasies outrageous prices for clothing yeah well i paid the box station 20 for that mount but i could put two people in it made it different than a single person mount i could put two people then you could get the fork the four oh i got the car i got the car um well and now you know you know that cart they have at the beginning that when you play the game and you're in that stupid cart oh that thing yeah yeah yeah you can buy you can buy that in the box i'm interested in that okay but for example for example i would just just say like an outfit in final fantasy right now is 18 and it is just clothing the the only thing i'm bringing up is i don't think gems ever are going to get cheaper in masters i think 300 for a pollen whatever much however much 300 well right now they're running a special where you could pay a dollar to get 300 gems which is ideally three polls if you're doing the daily the daily poll thing they're not going to get cheaper uh it's it's never gotten cheaper in apex i i think it's only gotten more expensive in final fantasy i don't remember ever seeing an eighteen dollar outfit in final fantasy but i hope they keep the 11th poll i think that would be good for the game i think it would i think it would help the non-guarantee issue problem yes i agree the last thing i want to talk about is the gem bundle which they rolled out maybe like two or three weeks ago or they rolled it out i think when the stamina system came out uh it's 7.99 and then what it does is um it gives you 500 page gems right away it does a sync orb reward boost for 20 days and then you get a thousand non-paid gems every time you log in so you get 50 every time you log in until i eat a thousand which i think is 20 days and then you get um 10 skip tickets every day you log in for 20 days which is 200 uh and it's 7.99 and i almost did it until i realized that the the 50 you get a day is non-paid yeah and all they would have to do is switch that to paid and i'd probably do it i don't i if you're separating out your currency of paid and non-paid and i'm paying you money why are you giving me non-paid gems dna i don't i have no problem with drip feeding you know hey you're you're getting this many gems total but we're only giving you 50 a day that's fine because i'm going to log in every day anyways and if i'm paying for something to remind myself to log in that's fine but don't give me non-paid gems i'm paying you money for gems don't give me not paid so i i like the concept of the gem bundle i like the sync or boost i think that's awesome i like the skip tickets i like the the price is fine but that one line bothered me i did send them feedback about that if i'm paying for gems do not give me non-paid that's all i'm asking for but i would not be surprised and this is this was a rumor that the data miners for pokemon go found that there was a subscription uh hidden in pokemon go as of the last update which is not surprising there's a subscription for fire emblem heroes there's a subscription for animal crossing there's a subscription for mario kart i would not be surprised i i again i i know i'm partnered with dna i have no inside knowledge i would not be surprised if this is if there would be a subscription to masters slash would be a subscription to pokemon go just a breaking news flash i decided to use my three thousand on the ten poll on the blue banner uh-huh did you get four blues in a single pole incredible greg i'm so happy for you no but i just get two you got something whoa that's sweet now you guys need to evaluate your life choices you're the one playing gardens i am actually knitting right now and doing something worthwhile with my time i two two in the same poll that's all so i'm feeling i take back a little bit what i said okay perfect it's it's almost like rng gives and rng takes ah ever since the eggs been have been introduced in masters i've had tons of people through slack or through twitch streams say that they got back into masters because of eggs and they specifically just like the eggs i i am so tired of eggs really like i don't know i don't know what to do with all these pokemon other than just turn them in because yeah never going to sink you can you can filter by um one and two and i just throw away all the one and twos and then yeah i've been doing that too but i'm like okay so now i have a bunch of different threes i have i'm never gonna power them up because i've heard there's only that nidoqueen nidoking might be really really good with um leaf because of her poison stuff and apparently janine has gotten really good because she has poison stuff too and there wasn't a really good poison setter until leaf arrived last week or yeah venom trench oh the venom drenched wouldn't it be better with koga though uh maybe yeah poisoned with i don't know because venom drenched too and coke is a lot faster um hmm so when does the fam so family story family time story event begins nine nine so not next week but the week after which seems appropriate i believe the egg stuff the charmander bulbasaur squirtle stuff i believe that starts on the third which right now is we get the normal eggs which i think the only i think the only one that can be shiny is tauros yep which i have not pulled they did put out a little uh trailer or whatever of like celebrating the one year and the thing i found the most interesting is at one point in masters you could have picked which egg you want so like professor bellis is that her name yeah she was like do you want charmander squirtle or bubble sore classic you know the classic only you know that classic oh gee fans will remember uh and i think master i i don't have the numbers in front of me but i'm pretty sure it was eight million people picked squirtle eight million people picked bulbasaur and 18 million people picked charmander and you you you wonder why they pushed charizard so hard that's a lot of that's a big difference which is funny because at the time red was already in the game you could have already had red and charizard in the game maybe people felt like oh i can't pull red so i'll pick the charmander well but you couldn't get a charmander yeah that's the thing yeah it's true i guess uh but charmander squirtle bulbasaur will be appearing in eggs and i believe on the third so that's happening um there's a lot happening in masters right now so if you haven't played it if you're curious you get the 3 000 bonus when you log in and then you get the daily gem bonus when you load perfect game it's still fun are frustrating things as there are in all gadget games but yeah give it a shot see what you think now now's probably a very good time to jump in yeah they're being generous because it's the one year all right there was uh some other stuff that we could talk about but we've gone real long so we'll save it for next week i don't think there's any more anniversary slash pogo like i don't think unless niantic was gonna completely rework the mega evolution in a week which i don't think so uh i think i think we're in the clear will pokemon of the week all right so last week's pokemon of the week i was going real easy on everybody because coming up we're going extra hard i'm tired of the complaints and the the soft all you softies out there so get ready but last week's it wasn't a pokemon had something to do with mountain biking which is very expensive and going around hoenn and you had an option of two bikes and it's not the mock bike so therefore it's quick claw yes it's the aggro bike acro bike thank you or the one wheel you know this should bring that one wheel thing into the next gen 9. yeah well they probably will wrote on one wheel wasn't there a rumor that skateboards were being added wasn't that like a thing for gen seven yeah probably at all it wasn't a good one wow it wasn't a good rumor it was just a remember there's no shiny acro bike i think there was once an acrobatic tcg card that like lets you look at two cards from the top of your deck or something weird like that but there you go there's no trivia except except it bounces well i mean mountain bikes bounce as well if you know what you're doing all right you are wounded from your front set activities uh hey i went mountain biking for an hour yesterday and did not fall once and went on the more difficult course so i'm getting better good job all right so we're going harder this week next week uh i believe at one point i threatened that it would just be one letter of the alphabet and not an unknown we're we're about there folks uh we didn't do trivia for the bike is there trivia yes in generation four at rad's rickshaws cycle shop there's an advertisement on the shelves for mock bikes and acura bikes oh that's right in omega ruby alpha sapphire the bells on different bikes have different sounds they do because omega ruby apple software is one of the greatest games ever made and let's go pikachu let's go eevee the bike maniac in cerulean city has some acro bikes on display in his home well there you go that's more trivia than a lot of that's very true i'm impressed all right are you guys ready for this week's pokemon no because there's going to be like one letter and i'll have no idea that's like it that's in one or two weeks from now we're going to be getting harder and harder mega all right this week's pokemon american english-speaking fans of the australian band king gizzard and the lizard wizard will instantly recognize this week's pokemon in the name of the fourth song on their only album that was released in 2016. this is the infinite loop album that can be played over and over again non-stop as a continuous flow i say the only album released in 2016 because they released five albums in 2017 no new material in 2018 and two albums in 2019 i must clarify that in a vernacular sense the bird mentioned in the song title is not actually in the name of this week's pokemon it appears that in north america we interchangeably refer to a particular carrion loving bird by two different names in the rest of the world including australia the bird referenced in this week's pokemon's name is sometimes used interchangeably when referring to walks i can reliably say that north americans do not view walks to be anything close to the bird referred to in this week's pokemon and game freak must agree as the art for this pokemon does not resemble a huak in any way adding to the confusion is some additional intellectual and linguistic ambiguity the first part of this week's pokemon's name refers to an organ that in mammals and fishies is considered to hold the teeth historically in this universe birds do not have teeth but it appears that the upper and lower portions of the beaks are referred to using the same word we would use for the teeth-holding organ all right that's all you get oh it's so easy i had to listen to that again i'll post it in the slack please do so there's okay quick question about is this a cd still that you can list on the infinite loop did they release it digitally uh just does it work diligently the way that well yeah because if you're in itunes and you can you can put an album on repeat album right but it's just basically if if you play it start to finish once it finishes you can go to the first song and it'll flow right into the first song dang that's a lot of work it is i forgot to say the blue red and leaf event run until like september 30th a lot of time on that so don't feel like you have to spend 79.99 right away even though i might that's alright you're such a sucker i look i'm having a good time with masters greg don't judge me just because i will judge you because you're still a sucker my polls are better than your polls although i don't know if i'm gonna beat that two blue that two blues yeah that's good retire now i'm done i'm out i'm out of the game i sent i took my proof i sent it to the only person who could possibly care about it and then i'm out kickstarter ended thank you everyone uh who did the kickstarter i think like 188 people uh did it awesome thank
