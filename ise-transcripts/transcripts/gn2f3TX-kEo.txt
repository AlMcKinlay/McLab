the fact they had made twenty dollars (2:18 - 2:22)
and then get into the food parade what (2:20 - 2:23)
they were offering at the food parade (2:22 - 2:25)

minnesota state fair which is not (2:46 - 2:49)
happening (2:48 - 2:51)

could get in your car and drive (2:51 - 2:54)
through the fairgrounds and stop at the (2:52 - 2:55)
food vendors (2:54 - 2:58)
but then also restaurants that would (2:55 - 2:59)

little state fair in my life (3:33 - 3:38)
this week and here's the thing will (3:35 - 3:40)
here's the thing that kills me (3:38 - 3:44)
it's cold for state fair time (3:40 - 3:46)
you could have had the most comfortable (3:44 - 3:48)
state fair experience (3:46 - 3:51)
wow back the weather it's always it (3:48 - 3:52)
comes full circle (3:51 - 3:54)
i was trying to avoid mentioning the (3:52 - 3:56)
fact that i went out on my bike this (3:54 - 3:58)
morning and i was shivering because i (3:56 - 4:00)
was wearing my running shorts a long (3:58 - 4:02)
sleeve running shirt and i was like it's (4:00 - 4:04)
real cold out here (4:02 - 4:06)
ah always gonna love that if if you (4:04 - 4:08)
stopped asking us how our week was you (4:06 - 4:09)
stopped doing anything (4:08 - 4:12)
polite and small talky on this podcast (4:09 - 4:15)
you're like get to work get the podcast (4:12 - 4:16)
out (4:15 - 4:19)
talk about pokemon i'm we are bringing (4:16 - 4:20)
back the human (4:19 - 4:23)
touch steve okay yeah that's what people (4:20 - 4:23)
enjoy (4:23 - 4:26)
people like humanity instead of your (4:23 - 4:27)
robotic (4:26 - 4:28)
chicken cooking let me tell you (4:27 - 4:30)
combustion (4:28 - 4:32)
nightmare how humanity is the worst (4:30 - 4:34)
through me cooking (4:32 - 4:37)
on twitch number one is we had a sub (4:34 - 4:39)
goal where if i hit a certain amount of (4:37 - 4:41)
subs i would cook a meal (4:39 - 4:44)
the appeal to that is i hate cooking (4:41 - 4:46)
it's a disaster and people like to watch (4:44 - 4:48)
a disaster number two (4:46 - 4:50)
is the first time i cooked which was (4:48 - 4:52)
like six months ago we made pokemon (4:50 - 4:53)
poffins (4:52 - 4:55)
and they turned out awful we did irene (4:53 - 4:57)
wouldn't even eat them she threw them (4:55 - 4:57)
right away (4:57 - 5:00)
you killed the yeast uh i did you talked (4:57 - 5:01)
about that i didn't realize how (5:00 - 5:03)
hard yeast was to deal with but (5:01 - 5:04)
apparently everyone says that (5:03 - 5:08)
it's a living creature number two is (5:04 - 5:11)
i uh nick fine fellow who does all the (5:08 - 5:12)
music for the show (5:11 - 5:16)
got me a pokemon waffle maker for my (5:12 - 5:19)
wedding i am still surprised (5:16 - 5:21)
that that worked yeah it actually worked (5:19 - 5:23)
it was like a thinkgeek exclusive back (5:21 - 5:24)
before gamestop (5:23 - 5:27)
absorbed thinking went to my wife and i (5:24 - 5:29)
said i want to use this pokemon waffle (5:27 - 5:30)
maker and the only thing that i can (5:29 - 5:32)
think of that goes with waffles is (5:30 - 5:33)
chicken and i (5:32 - 5:36)
you know i you can't do a stream of just (5:33 - 5:37)
making waffles that would be (5:36 - 5:40)
a very short well boring stream (5:37 - 5:42)
the way you were making waffles you (5:40 - 5:43)
could have made plenty (5:42 - 5:46)
plenty of time the next time you're in (5:43 - 5:46)
the area (5:46 - 5:49)
remind we're going to go to black coffee (5:46 - 5:50)
and waffles (5:49 - 5:53)
because they serve everything except (5:50 - 5:54)
chicken with their waffles (5:53 - 5:58)
it's really delicious well we can go to (5:54 - 6:01)
uh revival and get actual chicken (5:58 - 6:02)
waffles too (6:01 - 6:04)
so this is this is the thing i've (6:02 - 6:05)
learned is (6:04 - 6:08)
that i always learn nothing ever i (6:05 - 6:09)
always thought look (6:08 - 6:12)
on twitch you always have the person in (6:09 - 6:12)
chat (6:12 - 6:14)
or the people in chat that are like why (6:12 - 6:16)
aren't you doing this (6:14 - 6:19)
why why does your why is your gastrodon (6:16 - 6:21)
maxed in speed it's supposed to be on (6:19 - 6:22)
trick you always have your backseat (6:21 - 6:23)
gamers (6:22 - 6:26)
but let me tell you people who backseat (6:23 - 6:28)
cookers (6:26 - 6:30)
are way worse than backseat gamers (6:28 - 6:31)
they're awful they (6:30 - 6:35)
have no clue i posted the the (6:31 - 6:38)
the recipe in the discord and uh (6:35 - 6:40)
like one of the stuff one of the things (6:38 - 6:42)
the recipe was fill up the frying pan a (6:40 - 6:42)
half (6:42 - 6:46)
inch with oil and everyone was losing (6:42 - 6:47)
their mind that there was too much oil (6:46 - 6:49)
or not enough oil (6:47 - 6:51)
it's in the recipe why would i not (6:49 - 6:52)
follow (6:51 - 6:55)
what the recipe says because you picked (6:52 - 6:56)
the wrong (6:55 - 6:58)
recipe we just talked about this back (6:56 - 7:00)
alley fights among chefs (6:58 - 7:03)
also here are three things that i want (7:00 - 7:04)
to bring up one (7:03 - 7:07)
oh here we go did you or did you not (7:04 - 7:09)
break your whisk (7:07 - 7:12)
in dry ingredients no (7:09 - 7:14)
no we were wait we were halfway through (7:12 - 7:16)
why are you whisking dry ingredients (7:14 - 7:19)
i was whispering that's a wooden spoon (7:16 - 7:21)
the (7:19 - 7:23)
look there didn't say what utensils was (7:21 - 7:24)
in the instructions (7:23 - 7:28)
because any intelligent person (7:24 - 7:30)
knows that you use the wooden spoon with (7:28 - 7:32)
the dry ingredients and the whisk is for (7:30 - 7:34)
whisking together wet ingredients it's (7:32 - 7:36)
an emulsifier (7:34 - 7:38)
the whisk got a lot of mileage that (7:36 - 7:40)
night that evening (7:38 - 7:43)
two do you actually know what a cheese (7:40 - 7:45)
grater is (7:43 - 7:49)
okay i don't want to reveal (7:45 - 7:50)
you don't have to this is a yes or no (7:49 - 7:52)
question yes i know what a cheese grater (7:50 - 7:53)
is (7:52 - 7:56)
okay this was not apparent on the stream (7:53 - 7:57)
watch the vod (7:56 - 8:00)
pkmcast at twitch yeah but i don't wanna (7:57 - 8:01)
okay (8:00 - 8:04)
three did you like what you made (8:01 - 8:05)
yeah yeah no it turned out good when (8:04 - 8:07)
you're done yeah you actually i (8:05 - 8:09)
you know i will say this at the end of (8:07 - 8:11)
the stream because i popped in and out (8:09 - 8:13)
for as much as you were doing (8:11 - 8:15)
controversial things which (8:13 - 8:17)
because everybody has an opinion how you (8:15 - 8:20)
fry everybody has an opinion how you (8:17 - 8:21)
bread (8:20 - 8:23)
the food actually looked really good i i (8:21 - 8:25)
will go on record saying (8:23 - 8:28)
i would have eaten what you made (8:25 - 8:31)
i appreciate that my wife ate it all (8:28 - 8:32)
yeah she liked it (8:31 - 8:34)
she texted me you know the only thing i (8:32 - 8:36)
wish i would have done is add a little (8:34 - 8:38)
more hot sauce to it (8:36 - 8:40)
yeah well that's a preference but you (8:38 - 8:41)
know that's (8:40 - 8:42)
controversial that was saying i was (8:41 - 8:45)
adding too much off the bet (8:42 - 8:48)
well this hot hot and spice level is 100 (8:45 - 8:50)
a preference thing you can't say that's (8:48 - 8:52)
too much or too little (8:50 - 8:55)
also for the record you can (8:52 - 8:58)
and people have throughout the ages (8:55 - 9:01)
had big glasses of buttermilk (8:58 - 9:03)
oh that is a drinkable liquid i don't (9:01 - 9:05)
think for like (9:03 - 9:07)
however many subs or bits i would have (9:05 - 9:08)
tried buttermilk (9:07 - 9:12)
it was a very awful smell (9:08 - 9:15)
i mean it's acidic milk you can make (9:12 - 9:16)
buttermilk by adding lemon juice to (9:15 - 9:18)
regular milk (9:16 - 9:20)
buttermilk it's like it's slightly (9:18 - 9:22)
curdled milk that's the whole point yeah (9:20 - 9:22)
well if you (9:22 - 9:25)
if you did not get to watch me cook in (9:22 - 9:26)
the kitchen (9:25 - 9:28)
that will be up on youtube on either i (9:26 - 9:30)
think wednesday or friday so (9:28 - 9:32)
we'll give you all the all the best (9:30 - 9:33)
highlights so instead of watching a four (9:32 - 9:36)
hour stream you can watch it video (9:33 - 9:38)
of you melting down because you you'll (9:36 - 9:40)
ask a question to walk away and 15 (9:38 - 9:41)
people (9:40 - 9:43)
answer and of course they all answer (9:41 - 9:46)
differently and then you get mad (9:43 - 9:46)
there's a lot of things on my stream (9:49 - 9:53)
that are like (9:50 - 9:56)
amplified like like i'm not actually mad (9:53 - 9:59)
or you know i'm not actually upset it's (9:56 - 10:00)
just like (9:59 - 10:02)
it's for the show it's for it's to be (10:00 - 10:03)
entertaining (10:02 - 10:05)
but there is there was a point in that (10:03 - 10:07)
stream where (10:05 - 10:10)
you saw my brain break in half (10:07 - 10:14)
where i i i thought to myself (10:10 - 10:16)
i'm just gonna hit the end stream button (10:14 - 10:18)
and throw all of this away (10:16 - 10:21)
and uh go to bed (10:18 - 10:21)
uh that that did almost happen okay (10:22 - 10:31)
pokemon of the week (10:26 - 10:31)
uh (10:31 - 10:37)
please i've barely finished writing it (10:33 - 10:38)
wait you're talking a person has such a (10:37 - 10:40)
bad week i forgot to post questions of (10:38 - 10:41)
the week so (10:40 - 10:43)
we're there already peeps all right well (10:41 - 10:44)
we have uh (10:43 - 10:45)
we have two big things to talk about (10:44 - 10:48)
this episode uh one is pokemon masters (10:45 - 10:50)
one is pokemon go (10:48 - 10:52)
uh they both added new stuff for the (10:50 - 10:53)
most part (10:52 - 10:56)
i don't know well one is pretty liked (10:53 - 11:00)
i guess and one is pretty not liked so (10:56 - 11:02)
let's start with the pokemon go which is (11:00 - 11:06)
the controversial stuff i guess (11:02 - 11:08)
number one there's two things pokemon go (11:06 - 11:08)
i'll get the first thing out of the way (11:08 - 11:09)
here (11:08 - 11:10)
wait let's get the real pokemon go (11:09 - 11:13)
controversy out of the way first (11:10 - 11:15)
will anderson's not getting a victini (11:13 - 11:16)
until the regular people can get (11:15 - 11:19)
the victini oh and i cannot believe (11:16 - 11:23)
that that happened yeah niantic (11:19 - 11:24)
no no because i looked it up and (11:23 - 11:26)
basically (11:24 - 11:29)
if you did not log in to pokemon go on (11:26 - 11:31)
the sunday of pokemon go fest (11:29 - 11:33)
you do not get the research question oh (11:31 - 11:34)
because the server didn't (11:33 - 11:36)
assign it to your i'm not gonna assign (11:34 - 11:38)
doesn't the server waiter (11:36 - 11:41)
reception whoever i don't care that is (11:38 - 11:42)
the fundamental (11:41 - 11:44)
rule that they did not advertise ahead (11:42 - 11:46)
of time or they did (11:44 - 11:48)
and i didn't read it so you opened up (11:46 - 11:50)
pokemon go on saturday got that quest (11:48 - 11:50)
line (11:50 - 11:53)
but you didn't open up pokemon go on (11:50 - 11:54)
sunday (11:53 - 11:55)
i don't think i opened it on saturday (11:54 - 11:57)
either i may have i don't know but i (11:55 - 11:58)
certainly didn't on sunday because (11:57 - 12:00)
that's the day i was doing the wedding (11:58 - 12:01)
stuff (12:00 - 12:04)
what's your controversy beat that all (12:01 - 12:05)

at the end of the (12:43 - 12:45)

perfect time to fine tune your lineup uh (12:47 - 12:52)
use this opportunity to leverage your (12:50 - 12:54)
faster charge tms (12:52 - 12:56)
uh that's that's it it's just they're (12:54 - 12:57)
still (12:56 - 13:00)
go battle league is not gbl not not the (12:57 - 13:03)
not the most stable product out there i (13:00 - 13:06)
will say (13:03 - 13:08)
so that's the first bit of news alone (13:06 - 13:09)
raichu in (13:08 - 13:13)
research breakthrough for uh (13:09 - 13:16)
september train will end on september (13:13 - 13:17)
10th (13:16 - 13:19)
so plenty of time for heatran then (13:17 - 13:21)
cresselia will show up for a week (13:19 - 13:23)
then articuno will show up for a week (13:21 - 13:24)
which is (13:23 - 13:27)
september 18th and then zapdos will show (13:24 - 13:30)
up on september 25th and then nothing (13:27 - 13:32)
after that so i'm assuming well trace (13:30 - 13:34)
will be after that it'd be really weird (13:32 - 13:34)
to do (13:34 - 13:37)
articuno and zapdos uh my assumption is (13:34 - 13:38)
why (13:37 - 13:40)
articuno zapdos and probably maltrace (13:38 - 13:42)
are coming back is to advertise for the (13:40 - 13:43)
crown tundra (13:42 - 13:45)
well see that's what i that's why i (13:43 - 13:46)
asked when they were doing it because i (13:45 - 13:48)
was going to say if it was like october (13:46 - 13:50)
or november when we're going to get the (13:48 - 13:51)
alternate versions of them (13:50 - 13:54)
then that would make sense but yeah if (13:51 - 13:55)
we're just getting the (13:54 - 13:56)
you would want to run the normal ones (13:55 - 13:58)
first and then the alternative ones (13:56 - 13:59)
closer no (13:58 - 14:01)
okay but i would assume that you run (13:59 - 14:02)
articuno's after (14:01 - 14:04)
a small trace and then in the game at (14:02 - 14:05)
like put the outfit (14:04 - 14:08)
in or advertise or advertise somehow and (14:05 - 14:09)
then like we'll (14:08 - 14:11)
we'll get a trailer that week or we'll (14:09 - 14:13)
get a that's what i'm guessing i don't (14:11 - 14:13)
know (14:13 - 14:16)
okay this is the this is the the big (14:13 - 14:17)
thing (14:16 - 14:20)
it's it's arrived mega evolution (14:17 - 14:22)
oh what is that that sounds cool i had a (14:20 - 14:24)
pokemon professor tell me (14:22 - 14:25)
about how he heard about it from his (14:24 - 14:27)
friend sycamore and then he gave it all (14:25 - 14:32)
different names because (14:27 - 14:32)
come on dude you (14:32 - 14:37)
can now see some of your favorite (14:36 - 14:39)
pokemon in their mega evolved form by (14:37 - 14:40)
you (14:39 - 14:42)
utilizing mega evolution and pokemon go (14:40 - 14:44)
mega evolution enables certain pokemon (14:42 - 14:45)
to reach an additional evolutionary (14:44 - 14:46)
stage and gain (14:45 - 14:48)
incredible power for a limited time (14:46 - 14:50)
select pokemon can mega evolve using the (14:48 - 14:52)
newly discovered resource called mega (14:50 - 14:53)
energy (14:52 - 14:54)
you can collect the mysterious substance (14:53 - 14:56)
by completing mega raids (14:54 - 14:58)
which are raid battles featuring mega (14:56 - 15:00)
evolved pokemon (14:58 - 15:01)
the faster you defeat the raid boss the (15:00 - 15:03)
more mega energy you receive (15:01 - 15:07)
you can mega evolve any of your venusaur (15:03 - 15:09)
charizard blastoise b drill once you (15:07 - 15:11)
have enough of the corresponding energy (15:09 - 15:13)
uh plus some of these pokemon will (15:11 - 15:15)
appear in raids after you mega evolve a (15:13 - 15:17)
pokemon that pokemon will require (15:15 - 15:18)
less mega energy to mega evolve each (15:17 - 15:20)
time they're after (15:18 - 15:21)
mega evolved pokemon will stay in their (15:20 - 15:23)
mega forms for a limited time (15:21 - 15:26)
doesn't say here but it's four hours and (15:23 - 15:26)
while (15:26 - 15:28)
your pokemon is mega evolved you'll be (15:26 - 15:30)
able to do the following with them (15:28 - 15:32)
you can battle in raids you can battle (15:30 - 15:33)
in gyms (15:32 - 15:36)
you can battle team go rocket you can (15:33 - 15:37)
battle your friends (15:36 - 15:40)
you can watch it follow you on the map (15:37 - 15:40)
in (15:40 - 15:42)
the buddy thing and you can take a (15:40 - 15:44)
snapshot of your mega evolved (15:42 - 15:47)
pokemon be sure to open the app for a (15:44 - 15:49)
new mega evolution themed (15:47 - 15:51)
special research a mega discovery join (15:49 - 15:53)
professor willow as they learn (15:51 - 15:56)
more about the mega evolution phenomenon (15:53 - 15:59)
the month of september will (15:56 - 16:01)
be filled of events celebrating the (15:59 - 16:03)
introduction of mega pokemon (16:01 - 16:05)
so from september 1st through the 7th (16:03 - 16:06)
complete as many mega (16:05 - 16:09)
raids as you can gather energy to evolve (16:06 - 16:11)
your pokemon (16:09 - 16:13)
uh from the september 11th through the (16:11 - 16:15)
17th hone your battle skills with mega (16:13 - 16:17)
evolved pokemon take part in gym battles (16:15 - 16:20)
uh team go rocky battles trainer battles (16:17 - 16:24)
excluding go battle league and then from (16:20 - 16:26)
the september 22nd to the 28th become (16:24 - 16:28)
buddies with your mega pokemon (16:26 - 16:31)
uh remember to take snapshots etc (16:28 - 16:35)
so so are all the mega forms (16:31 - 16:37)
already in the game in the code yes but (16:35 - 16:38)
not (16:37 - 16:41)
you can there's only five pokemon four (16:38 - 16:42)
pokemon that can mega evolve (16:41 - 16:44)
one of those pokemon having two (16:42 - 16:45)
different forms which is charizard of (16:44 - 16:46)
course (16:45 - 16:49)
so there are five different mega pokemon (16:46 - 16:50)
you can obtain right now bee drill is (16:49 - 16:52)
technically the free one (16:50 - 16:55)
through the limited research so (16:52 - 16:57)
i just got best buddy with my gardevoir (16:55 - 16:59)
and i cannot mega evolve it (16:57 - 17:02)
no you not yet this is the this is (16:59 - 17:03)
garbage (17:02 - 17:06)
the go community from reddit (17:03 - 17:09)
to twitter to wherever else you want to (17:06 - 17:09)
look (17:09 - 17:12)
doesn't seem completely satisfied with (17:09 - 17:13)
this new mechanic (17:12 - 17:16)
if i could sum it up in a single phrase (17:13 - 17:17)
they they would say it's very money (17:16 - 17:18)
grabby (17:17 - 17:21)
you mean pokemon go is money grabby i've (17:18 - 17:23)
never heard such a thing (17:21 - 17:25)
what pokemon product has been ever been (17:23 - 17:28)
money grabby it's all geared towards (17:25 - 17:31)
fun first i have a lot to say about mega (17:28 - 17:33)
evolution but (17:31 - 17:36)
what have you guys done any mega raids (17:33 - 17:38)
have you a mega evolved what is your (17:36 - 17:38)
thoughts (17:38 - 17:40)
i did did i do a mega blast toys with (17:38 - 17:41)
you (17:40 - 17:44)
yeah i think so and then i didn't catch (17:41 - 17:46)
it (17:44 - 17:46)
i spent 100 coins i didn't catch the (17:46 - 17:50)
pokemon (17:49 - 17:53)
there you go i've seen the mega egg as (17:50 - 17:55)
around but (17:53 - 17:58)
i have not done any i'm so past the idea (17:55 - 17:58)
of (17:58 - 18:01)
megas at this point yeah that their (17:58 - 18:03)
introduction is (18:01 - 18:07)
not interesting well you like mangas (18:03 - 18:10)
i do like megas uh i don't particularly (18:07 - 18:11)
care for (18:10 - 18:14)
mega venus or mega blastoise or the the (18:11 - 18:16)
mega charizards (18:14 - 18:18)
i'd like the megas that i care about (18:16 - 18:20)
yeah i want my mega sable eye and i want (18:18 - 18:23)
my mega gardevoir you know and i'd also (18:20 - 18:25)
like a little more focus on unova before (18:23 - 18:29)
we just so casually move on (18:25 - 18:32)
you know is dead long live unova no (18:29 - 18:34)
younova's dead long live halos that's (18:32 - 18:36)
that's yeah that's the reality here (18:34 - 18:39)
okay so i ideally you need about 200 (18:36 - 18:42)
mega energy to mega evolve a pokemon (18:39 - 18:44)
of your choice but the mega energy is (18:42 - 18:46)
specific to the raids you do (18:44 - 18:48)
so i'm gonna i i okay i'm gonna (18:46 - 18:49)
interrupt here to say (18:48 - 18:53)
i do agree that in this time (18:49 - 18:56)
of not going out (18:53 - 19:01)
having them in raids does lend itself (18:56 - 19:02)
to being money grabbed before the remote (19:01 - 19:05)
raid passed (19:02 - 19:05)
yeah like that's kind of (19:05 - 19:10)
i would assume that that was like the (19:08 - 19:12)
the thought process though right we need (19:10 - 19:14)
we need to do something during the (19:12 - 19:16)
summer that doesn't involve people (19:14 - 19:17)
walking around (19:16 - 19:20)
and people like remote raid passes so (19:17 - 19:21)
let's tie this new feature to the thing (19:20 - 19:23)
that people like (19:21 - 19:25)
i mean but walking around isn't the (19:23 - 19:26)
problem people can walk around (19:25 - 19:29)
peacefully and not be near people all (19:26 - 19:30)
they want (19:29 - 19:32)
this is i don't know well maybe (19:30 - 19:34)
everywhere else in the world that isn't (19:32 - 19:37)
the united states maybe that's (19:34 - 19:38)
true (19:37 - 19:40)
think that there's something wrong with (19:38 - 19:43)
mega evolution but i don't agree with (19:40 - 19:44)
the complaints (19:43 - 19:47)
so i don't know how to like (19:44 - 19:48)
i don't know how to say this because it (19:47 - 19:50)
sounds like i'm defending it but i i (19:48 - 19:52)
just i don't like it or maybe i don't (19:50 - 19:53)
care for it (19:52 - 19:55)
okay what what are the complaints okay i (19:53 - 19:57)
i will i will attempt to defend said (19:55 - 19:58)
complaints okay so you (19:57 - 20:01)
so if you want mega charizard you gotta (19:58 - 20:01)
do (20:01 - 20:05)
mega charizard raids and when you (20:01 - 20:07)
complete a raid you get anywhere between (20:05 - 20:10)
uh like 40 to 60 (20:07 - 20:13)
or whatever probably realistically like (20:10 - 20:14)
50 (20:13 - 20:18)
mega energy okay so it takes (20:14 - 20:19)
even if you're not super fast it takes a (20:18 - 20:21)
person four to five (20:19 - 20:23)
charizard raids to then have enough (20:21 - 20:24)
energy to mega (20:23 - 20:27)
evolve charizard you can make a (20:24 - 20:28)
charizard you may evolve whichever (20:27 - 20:30)
charizard you want you got a shiny one (20:28 - 20:33)
from community day with blast burn you (20:30 - 20:34)
can pick that one to mega evolve (20:33 - 20:38)
you got a perfect charizard (20:34 - 20:40)
100 iv you can mega evolve that one with (20:38 - 20:42)
the 200. (20:40 - 20:45)
once you mega evolve it it will (20:42 - 20:47)
last for four hours and you can do (20:45 - 20:48)
everything we listed (20:47 - 20:51)
above battle team rocket walk around (20:48 - 20:52)
with it take a picture of it do more (20:51 - 20:53)
raids (20:52 - 20:57)
and then and then it d mega evolves like (20:53 - 20:58)
it does in the (20:57 - 21:02)
x and y and stuff and then you have to (20:58 - 21:03)
spend (21:02 - 21:07)
50 energy to mega evolve it again (21:03 - 21:10)
at any point so 200 initially to start (21:07 - 21:11)
it (21:10 - 21:14)
and then 50 for future uses (21:11 - 21:18)
so the complaint is i gotta spe (21:14 - 21:20)
i gotta spend money on raids i gotta get (21:18 - 21:21)
the energy (21:20 - 21:23)
i get the charizard it only lasts this (21:21 - 21:24)
amount of time (21:23 - 21:26)
i gotta use the charizard get more (21:24 - 21:27)
energy to do it again (21:26 - 21:29)
so it's like this cycle that they're (21:27 - 21:31)
going the complaint i would say is (21:29 - 21:32)
probably the cycle (21:31 - 21:34)
right because it's not permanent yeah i (21:32 - 21:36)
mean that's (21:34 - 21:40)
if if raids were easier to do right (21:36 - 21:42)
if raids in this current time where i (21:40 - 21:43)
can go (21:42 - 21:44)
down there i can go to the mall of (21:43 - 21:46)
america which is open and (21:44 - 21:49)
just always have raids available and (21:46 - 21:50)
gather (21:49 - 21:52)
around 20 people and quickly burn (21:50 - 21:53)
through this raid i think that system (21:52 - 21:55)
would be fine (21:53 - 21:58)
right now for people who are (21:55 - 22:01)
stuck uh or anybody in rural areas who (21:58 - 22:03)
are hoping somebody invites them (22:01 - 22:05)
you know that's five dollars for a four (22:03 - 22:07)
hour (22:05 - 22:10)
increase and then as a dollar each time (22:07 - 22:11)
you want to do it (22:10 - 22:15)
after which ain't great like (22:11 - 22:19)
that's five dollars to do it once and (22:15 - 22:20)
then a dollar every time (22:19 - 22:24)
thereafter that's we're approaching (22:20 - 22:28)
real real expensive territory there (22:24 - 22:31)
and it's like yeah you're paying to (22:28 - 22:31)
activate (22:31 - 22:35)
unlocked i mean it's just as bad as like (22:31 - 22:38)
like you've unlocked this shirt that you (22:35 - 22:39)
can now pay to buy (22:38 - 22:41)
right it's just like you're paying to (22:39 - 22:43)
unlock their well i mean (22:41 - 22:45)
functionality you're also paying for (22:43 - 22:46)
eggs you're paying for stardust you're (22:45 - 22:47)
paying for (22:46 - 22:49)
lucky eggs pay for none of that stuff i (22:47 - 22:50)
mean (22:49 - 22:52)
you are getting some you you're getting (22:50 - 22:53)
side benefits (22:52 - 22:58)
sure but that that happens (22:53 - 23:00)
with anything right like anytime you do (22:58 - 23:01)
any (23:00 - 23:03)
anything in that game you're getting (23:01 - 23:04)
side benefits (23:03 - 23:06)
this that is the incentive to keep you (23:04 - 23:08)
playing the game you can't look at that (23:06 - 23:09)
and say (23:08 - 23:12)
well the price of this is offset by that (23:09 - 23:16)
because that those freebies come with (23:12 - 23:18)
everything if you do a raid with (23:16 - 23:20)
somebody you don't even have to have the (23:18 - 23:21)
mega but if somebody brings the mega (23:20 - 23:22)
charizard to a (23:21 - 23:25)
mega venusaur raid and they tell me to (23:22 - 23:27)
i'm bringing mega charizard please pick (23:25 - 23:28)
a fire pokemon (23:27 - 23:31)
and then because that person brings mega (23:28 - 23:32)
charizard (23:31 - 23:35)
we get the venusaur raid done faster and (23:32 - 23:37)
then i get more energy (23:35 - 23:38)
because it was completed faster so i (23:37 - 23:40)
would say there is definitely (23:38 - 23:43)
a side benefit to which you have to (23:40 - 23:43)
organize (23:43 - 23:45)
outside of the app well every once we (23:43 - 23:47)
can't do because we're all doing remote (23:45 - 23:49)
we're all organizing though it's even (23:47 - 23:51)
easier between the discord and the slack (23:49 - 23:52)
and however else people (23:51 - 23:55)
their facebook groups or their discords (23:52 - 23:56)
it's easier for you (23:55 - 23:58)
i know yeah i'm like the the most (23:56 - 24:00)
organization i get is i (23:58 - 24:03)
get a text message it's like mega blast (24:00 - 24:06)
yeah (24:03 - 24:06)
because i've already organized it well (24:08 - 24:12)
i've made it as easy as possible for you (24:10 - 24:15)
i've i've done it still still didn't (24:12 - 24:16)
catch that (24:15 - 24:18)
manga blastoise so i wasted a hundred (24:16 - 24:19)
coins on (24:18 - 24:22)
like five minutes of broken phone screen (24:19 - 24:22)
yeah (24:22 - 24:24)
yeah hold on nothing great i think the (24:22 - 24:27)
money conversation is important (24:24 - 24:30)
the the actual cork mechanic of mega (24:27 - 24:33)
i think is it's it's what i have been (24:30 - 24:35)
saying for years (24:33 - 24:38)
of mega pokemon are not particularly (24:35 - 24:39)
interesting (24:38 - 24:41)
they are interesting in the sense of (24:39 - 24:42)
they look (24:41 - 24:44)
awesome i think they all look incredible (24:42 - 24:47)
with the exception of like maybe mega (24:44 - 24:48)
aerodactyl not (24:47 - 24:49)
not as cool looking because it has this (24:48 - 24:51)
weird goatee thing and it's kind of (24:49 - 24:51)
gross (24:51 - 24:54)
but every mega pokemon dare you attack (24:51 - 24:55)
brooklyn or (24:54 - 24:58)
aerodactyl that is rude brooklyn (24:55 - 25:00)
aerodynamic (24:58 - 25:00)
williamsburg aerodactyl i think all the (25:05 - 25:09)
mega pokemon look great (25:08 - 25:11)
and i think that if you were (25:09 - 25:14)
specifically a competitive person (25:11 - 25:18)
and you you played in the xy (25:14 - 25:21)
sun and moon omega ruby alpha sapphire (25:18 - 25:23)
actual format even let's go pikachu (25:21 - 25:26)
let's go eevee and you used mega pokemon (25:23 - 25:29)
there was value there as there are is (25:26 - 25:29)
value to (25:29 - 25:32)
any other held item like leftovers focus (25:29 - 25:33)
ash (25:32 - 25:36)
rindo berry because at the end of the (25:33 - 25:37)
day in the main series games (25:36 - 25:41)
mega evolutions was a held item yeah (25:37 - 25:44)
but no one was playing x and y and being (25:41 - 25:46)
like ah youngster joey's here with a (25:44 - 25:48)
rattata i got a mega evolve my (25:46 - 25:48)
kangaskhan (25:48 - 25:51)
no because it took too long and yeah (25:48 - 25:53)
we're gonna one shot is rattata anyways (25:51 - 25:56)
no one is like sosing in ultrasound (25:53 - 25:56)
ultramoon (25:56 - 25:58)
and being like i gotta bring out my mega (25:56 - 26:00)
garden for for this sos hunt like no (25:58 - 26:04)
like a normal gameplay never (26:00 - 26:06)
involved you mega evolving sure there's (26:04 - 26:08)
probably an exception where you were (26:06 - 26:09)
like you were frustrated you stubbed (26:08 - 26:10)
your toe (26:09 - 26:12)
you ran into trainer last and you mega (26:10 - 26:13)
evolved your (26:12 - 26:15)
blastoise to like one shot her skinny (26:13 - 26:17)
because you were upset you stubbed you (26:15 - 26:19)
i'm sure that situation existed i'm sure (26:17 - 26:20)
there's one person (26:19 - 26:22)
listening to this podcast that said they (26:20 - 26:24)
mega evolved their banette (26:22 - 26:26)
every single battle through x and y i'm (26:24 - 26:27)
sure that person or (26:26 - 26:28)
omega ruby of zephyr i'm sure that (26:27 - 26:30)
person exists but (26:28 - 26:34)
no one really used mega evolution unless (26:30 - 26:36)
you were testing it out you were running (26:34 - 26:37)
maybe the elite four (26:36 - 26:41)
or a gym leader and or you did vgc like (26:37 - 26:41)
normal (26:41 - 26:45)
gameplay stuff throughout the game (26:41 - 26:48)
just it just didn't happen it's it's (26:45 - 26:50)
like this weird (26:48 - 26:53)
mechanic that people have nostalgia for (26:50 - 26:57)
but that was specifically tied to only (26:53 - 26:58)
battles (26:57 - 27:01)
does anybody really have nostalgia for (26:58 - 27:04)
megas yeah every national dexter in the (27:01 - 27:05)
entire world that was upset that vegas (27:04 - 27:07)
were cut (27:05 - 27:10)
absolutely i mean okay so i i will (27:07 - 27:11)
actually say this (27:10 - 27:12)
i mean okay i'm going to say they didn't (27:11 - 27:14)
have things for i was i would argue that (27:12 - 27:16)
those national debtors (27:14 - 27:18)
have completionists they want it in the (27:16 - 27:19)
decks (27:18 - 27:21)
they don't if megas never existed they (27:19 - 27:23)
would still be upset that they (27:21 - 27:25)
that things weren't in the deck that's (27:23 - 27:27)
not a i love (27:25 - 27:29)
megas that's a i love completion (27:27 - 27:30)
argument (27:29 - 27:32)
i'm gonna posit an alternative and i (27:30 - 27:33)
will say why i (27:32 - 27:36)
am disappointed about mega evolution and (27:33 - 27:36)
kind of (27:36 - 27:39)
where it is was however (27:36 - 27:43)
uh i wanted more megas i wanted more (27:39 - 27:44)
pokemon to get (27:43 - 27:46)
mega evolutions and the fact that they (27:44 - 27:48)
just said we're not doing this anymore (27:46 - 27:50)
and it's like the ones you got are the (27:48 - 27:51)
ones you got and (27:50 - 27:54)
i'm sorry like your favorite pokemon (27:51 - 27:55)
didn't get a mega evolution and it never (27:54 - 27:56)
will now (27:55 - 27:58)
that's where my disappointment lies i (27:56 - 28:01)
just like have to mourn the loss (27:58 - 28:02)
right that there will be never be a mega (28:01 - 28:05)
fig tv there might be more megas in the (28:02 - 28:06)
future i mean we went (28:05 - 28:08)
how many games without any baby pokemon (28:06 - 28:09)
we went like three games without a (28:08 - 28:11)
single baby and we got a new baby and (28:09 - 28:14)
sword and shield that's that's fine (28:11 - 28:18)
anything is possible yes yes (28:14 - 28:21)
but i live in the world of now i live in (28:18 - 28:23)
the world of today and for today there (28:21 - 28:25)
will no longer be any meg evolutions (28:23 - 28:28)
and they i mean honestly (28:25 - 28:31)
dynamaxing giganta maxing that is the (28:28 - 28:33)
replacement for mega evolution (28:31 - 28:37)
and any pokemon can dynamics (28:33 - 28:39)
but right here's here's here's the new (28:37 - 28:41)
well except for zamasu (28:39 - 28:43)
when are we when is every pokemon gonna (28:41 - 28:47)
get a gigantic max for him (28:43 - 28:49)
i think the main i'm not answering that (28:47 - 28:50)
question i think the main (28:49 - 28:53)
thing that's been a coward there are two (28:50 - 28:55)
things that benefited vegas (28:53 - 28:58)
competitive battling which pokemon go is (28:55 - 29:00)
lacking right now (28:58 - 29:03)
and the anime that is it those are the (29:00 - 29:04)
two things (29:03 - 29:07)
mega evolution in the anime super sick (29:04 - 29:08)
awesome (29:07 - 29:12)
sweet loved it incredible would love it (29:08 - 29:14)
they were also able to introduce new (29:12 - 29:16)
pokemon designs without expanding the (29:14 - 29:17)
pokedex (29:16 - 29:20)
yes yeah yeah yeah yeah your favorite (29:17 - 29:21)
thing ever (29:20 - 29:24)
as much as i love pokemon go it doesn't (29:21 - 29:24)
have that (29:24 - 29:27)
so when you introduce a mechanic that (29:24 - 29:28)
was (29:27 - 29:30)
strategically used in high-level (29:28 - 29:32)
competitive battles (29:30 - 29:34)
and that's it that's all it was used for (29:32 - 29:36)
i mean you could argue that you used it (29:34 - 29:37)
through the story but you're just (29:36 - 29:38)
one-shotting things and you probably (29:37 - 29:39)
could have one-shot them without mega (29:38 - 29:40)
evolving (29:39 - 29:42)
you have raids you have team rocket and (29:40 - 29:44)
you have go battle league (29:42 - 29:47)
and that's it right and it doesn't work (29:44 - 29:49)
in go battle league (29:47 - 29:51)
i i was i'm sick of hearing like well (29:49 - 29:52)
when they do bring it to go battle (29:51 - 29:54)
league how about they fix go battle (29:52 - 29:55)
league first (29:54 - 29:57)
before we talk about when they bring it (29:55 - 29:58)
to go battle league (29:57 - 30:01)
because it's been about a year (29:58 - 30:04)
and go battle league is still terribly (30:01 - 30:05)
broken to the point where niantic put (30:04 - 30:07)
out a press release a week ago saying (30:05 - 30:08)
we're really sorry (30:07 - 30:10)
we're still trying to fix it so i don't (30:08 - 30:12)
want to hear about mega evolution coming (30:10 - 30:13)
to go battle league (30:12 - 30:15)
because it's still broken we're not even (30:13 - 30:17)
close to having that conversation yet (30:15 - 30:20)
so all that leads to is raids (30:17 - 30:23)
and team rocket i how (30:20 - 30:27)
what how do you hey (30:23 - 30:29)
ray i don't even look at my phone when (30:27 - 30:30)
i'm doing a raid (30:29 - 30:33)
how would megas make that better (30:30 - 30:33)
it's just like i'm trying to like (30:34 - 30:40)
see the complaint but i'm also trying to (30:38 - 30:41)
see the the (30:40 - 30:44)
like what people want because the raids (30:41 - 30:45)
are (30:44 - 30:48)
so one note and that's like i (30:45 - 30:51)
like raids it's fine i think they're (30:48 - 30:52)
like i like doing them even though i'm (30:51 - 30:54)
not looking at my screen (30:52 - 30:55)
but i never in a million years thought (30:54 - 30:57)
mega evolution was going to change (30:55 - 30:59)
my raid experience i think i'm adding (30:57 - 31:01)
the timer is cool (30:59 - 31:03)
i think rewarding players for doing it (31:01 - 31:05)
faster is like a good challenge in (31:03 - 31:07)
itself that's like again like (31:05 - 31:08)
monster hunter has that you don't really (31:07 - 31:10)
get anything for killing a monster (31:08 - 31:12)
faster in monster hunter but it's still (31:10 - 31:14)
nice to be like oh man i killed this (31:12 - 31:15)
great jaggerist in seven minutes and (31:14 - 31:16)
then the next time you do it man i (31:15 - 31:18)
killed it in six minutes (31:16 - 31:19)
oh now i killed it in five minutes and (31:18 - 31:21)
50 seconds like that is i'm glad that (31:19 - 31:21)
you (31:21 - 31:23)
i'm glad that you brought that up hey (31:21 - 31:24)
folks i'm playing monster hunter (31:23 - 31:26)
generations ultimate again hit me up if (31:24 - 31:28)
you want to go kill some gourmet galas (31:26 - 31:28)
okay (31:28 - 31:33)
i'm down um do you think (31:28 - 31:36)
no listen this is this is real talk (31:33 - 31:40)
do you think that there's some aspect of (31:36 - 31:40)
it that (31:40 - 31:44)
is and let's go for the pokemon go (31:40 - 31:46)
player who is only a pokemon go player (31:44 - 31:48)
never played a traditional console (31:46 - 31:52)
handheld pokemon game never played tcg (31:48 - 31:55)
only ever played pokemon go do you think (31:52 - 31:55)
that there (31:55 - 31:59)
might be having some argument of this is (31:55 - 32:00)
the new thing (31:59 - 32:03)
i want to have the new thing and now (32:00 - 32:05)
there's a financial barrier for me to be (32:03 - 32:06)
able to get the new thing and that's (32:05 - 32:08)
where their aggravation is coming from (32:06 - 32:11)
no this is their problem i say they as (32:08 - 32:12)
like (32:11 - 32:14)
the hardcore pokemon go player i i can i (32:12 - 32:15)
can relate to this (32:14 - 32:17)
so the complaint i saw that stood out to (32:15 - 32:18)
me the most was (32:17 - 32:20)
they're frustrated that they are they're (32:18 - 32:22)
not frustrated that they're spending (32:20 - 32:23)
money (32:22 - 32:25)
they're frustrated that that they don't (32:23 - 32:27)
feel like it's a completionist thing (32:25 - 32:29)
i think the example was like i spent 80 (32:27 - 32:31)
dollars to get a (32:29 - 32:35)
100 iv perfect rayquaza (32:31 - 32:38)
and that i was done right (32:35 - 32:41)
i did it i got what i wanted and they (32:38 - 32:43)
don't feel that with mega evolution (32:41 - 32:45)
i think that's valid yeah i think it is (32:43 - 32:48)
too i think it's (32:45 - 32:50)
you know i'm i'm not one to get a (32:48 - 32:51)
hundred ivs but (32:50 - 32:53)
people have personal goals right like i (32:51 - 32:56)
keep getting more xp and pokemon go (32:53 - 32:58)
not because it does anything but i just (32:56 - 33:00)
like seeing that number go up so i (32:58 - 33:00)
understand (33:00 - 33:03)
personal goals i think the complaints (33:00 - 33:04)
around it are just wrong (33:03 - 33:06)
and i do agree that i don't think mega (33:04 - 33:08)
evolution is great but i don't think (33:06 - 33:10)
it's because of the implementation (33:08 - 33:11)
implement (33:10 - 33:12)
i don't think it's the way they (33:11 - 33:14)
implement it i just think that mega (33:12 - 33:15)
evolution is not particularly (33:14 - 33:19)
interesting if you think it's both (33:15 - 33:21)
really yeah so let's say you were a (33:19 - 33:23)
free-to-play player (33:21 - 33:25)
or you spent you you try to spend as (33:23 - 33:26)
little money as possible those people (33:25 - 33:27)
exist (33:26 - 33:29)
and you just wanted mega evolution for (33:27 - 33:32)
the decks it is completely possible to (33:29 - 33:32)
do this (33:32 - 33:35)
right if it takes let's just assume it (33:32 - 33:36)
takes five raids (33:35 - 33:39)
to get 200 energy and you wanted (33:36 - 33:41)
five pokemon for your decks two (33:39 - 33:43)
charizard blastoise venus or beedrill (33:41 - 33:46)
bee drills free so you only need four (33:43 - 33:47)
you do five raids a week you get one (33:46 - 33:49)
raid pass a day (33:47 - 33:51)
you skip two days you know take your (33:49 - 33:52)
weekend to rest (33:51 - 33:54)
but you can get charizard week one (33:52 - 33:56)
charizard week two blastoise week three (33:54 - 33:57)
venusaur week four (33:56 - 33:59)
in a month you can get all the mega (33:57 - 34:00)
evolution (33:59 - 34:02)
without spending a penny so i don't (34:00 - 34:05)
think there's this huge (34:02 - 34:06)
money cost they're asking for if you (34:05 - 34:08)
just want to complete your decks (34:06 - 34:11)
now if you do want mega evolution to do (34:08 - 34:12)
raids (34:11 - 34:15)
i don't see where the money there is (34:12 - 34:16)
either (34:15 - 34:18)
right you're already doing the raids you (34:16 - 34:20)
probably will get the (34:18 - 34:23)
the energy from it you will then spend (34:20 - 34:25)
the energy to do raids like (34:23 - 34:29)
i'm i'm not sure the people complaining (34:25 - 34:31)
is probably maybe the middle road people (34:29 - 34:32)
that are willing to spend like twenty (34:31 - 34:34)
dollars to try to get like a shiny (34:32 - 34:36)
heatran but they're not willing to spend (34:34 - 34:37)
like a hundred (34:36 - 34:39)
but they're like willing to spend time (34:37 - 34:40)
about yourself yeah (34:39 - 34:44)
you're talking i spend zero dollars (34:40 - 34:46)
i mean i i hate the fact that i've had (34:44 - 34:48)
to do remote raid passes a lot and (34:46 - 34:49)
like half the time when you're like do (34:48 - 34:50)
you want to do this i'm like no i don't (34:49 - 34:51)
want to spend the money (34:50 - 34:53)
because it's just not worth it but going (34:51 - 34:55)
back to the free thing if i if i do five (34:53 - 34:56)
raids (34:55 - 34:58)
a week for free and i can get all the (34:56 - 35:00)
megas currently for my decks which is (34:58 - 35:02)
what i personally want to do because i (35:00 - 35:04)
don't plan on using them in raids (35:02 - 35:06)
particularly unless it's maybe like a (35:04 - 35:08)
raid day where they do the three-hour (35:06 - 35:08)
things (35:08 - 35:10)
i can do that for free in a week and (35:08 - 35:12)
before anyone says like well remote raid (35:10 - 35:13)
passes stuff like that (35:12 - 35:15)
you can literally apply that to the last (35:13 - 35:17)
four years of pogo i don't want to hear (35:15 - 35:18)
that argument of like (35:17 - 35:20)
well i don't have i live in a suburb i (35:18 - 35:22)
don't have like that is all of four (35:20 - 35:24)
years of pogo that is not specific to (35:22 - 35:25)
mega evolution (35:24 - 35:28)
that is literally every raid since raids (35:25 - 35:29)
have started (35:28 - 35:31)
it's not exclusive to this issue i mean (35:29 - 35:33)
the thing that we're (35:31 - 35:35)
the having to constantly get energy (35:33 - 35:37)
thing just it's weird (35:35 - 35:41)
to me like i could see much like (35:37 - 35:44)
in the game if you had to get x amount (35:41 - 35:45)
of (35:44 - 35:46)
pieces and then you got the stone and (35:45 - 35:49)
then you could choose to evolve it (35:46 - 35:51)
from then on that would make a little (35:49 - 35:53)
bit more sense to me than oh i have to (35:51 - 35:54)
get (35:53 - 35:57)
i have to generate energy to (35:54 - 35:59)
to do this thing i already did even (35:57 - 36:00)
though it's less (35:59 - 36:04)
i hate yeah i hate that crap (36:00 - 36:05)
i can see that aggravation right because (36:04 - 36:07)
yeah in the game you get the mega stone (36:05 - 36:08)
and then you can mega evolve your (36:07 - 36:10)
pokemon as much as you want (36:08 - 36:12)
yeah right why can't i just get a mega (36:10 - 36:14)
stone in pokemon go for (36:12 - 36:16)
this particular pokemon and then i can (36:14 - 36:18)
make it evolve it whenever i want (36:16 - 36:20)
oh because niantic's not gonna make any (36:18 - 36:22)
money that way but everything in pokemon (36:20 - 36:23)
go is a grind (36:22 - 36:24)
you wanna you wanna level up your (36:23 - 36:26)
gyarados well (36:24 - 36:30)
grind out stardust but my gyarados once (36:26 - 36:31)
leveled up (36:30 - 36:33)
i don't then have to power it with 15 (36:31 - 36:35)
more gyarados energy because it fell (36:33 - 36:36)
back to a message sure (36:35 - 36:38)
yeah yeah that's true like once that (36:36 - 36:41)
once that thing is done once i have done (36:38 - 36:42)
that grind (36:41 - 36:45)
that that grind is done this is hey (36:42 - 36:46)
we've done this grind (36:45 - 36:48)
now you get a lesser grind every time (36:46 - 36:50)
you want to do it (36:48 - 36:52)
that doesn't feel great to me even if it (36:50 - 36:53)
was like (36:52 - 36:57)
if you do a hundred mega blastoise raids (36:53 - 36:58)
and then you get the mega stone because (36:57 - 37:00)
you've done it a hundred times (36:58 - 37:02)
that's still better than you always have (37:00 - 37:04)
to do the energy (37:02 - 37:06)
give you give them something to aim for (37:04 - 37:08)
right well they did say that energy was (37:06 - 37:08)
going to (37:08 - 37:12)
come to different things they didn't (37:08 - 37:13)
they they have said that like there will (37:12 - 37:15)
be other ways to get energy that is not (37:13 - 37:16)
raid specific (37:15 - 37:17)
unless i'm wrong i'm almost positive (37:16 - 37:19)
they said that better be in those gifts (37:17 - 37:22)
i'm sending out them gifts every day but (37:19 - 37:24)
this is this is the thing niantic is (37:22 - 37:24)
every (37:24 - 37:26)
niantic in the pokemon company is always (37:24 - 37:27)
done right (37:26 - 37:30)
like what was super rare that people (37:27 - 37:32)
cared about (37:30 - 37:34)
you know four years ago it was dratini (37:32 - 37:35)
like it was (37:34 - 37:37)
it was mind-blowing to find a dratini (37:35 - 37:39)
and then they did tortini community (37:37 - 37:40)
today and people were like all right (37:39 - 37:41)
durtini's done never need another (37:40 - 37:42)
dratini again (37:41 - 37:44)
even though there are plenty of players (37:42 - 37:46)
that still needed routine now any time (37:44 - 37:47)
dratini shows up it's just nothing but (37:46 - 37:48)
like (37:47 - 37:50)
oh all i'm seeing is dratini this is (37:48 - 37:51)
like a thing that people were sought (37:50 - 37:52)
after (37:51 - 37:54)
for the longest time the same with (37:52 - 37:55)
melton when we first got milton you (37:54 - 37:57)
could open the box once every like 10 (37:55 - 37:58)
days (37:57 - 38:00)
then they were like you can open it once (37:58 - 38:01)
every 10 days but we doubled the spawns (38:00 - 38:03)
and then like two months later they're (38:01 - 38:05)
like you can open it once every week (38:03 - 38:06)
two months after that they were like you (38:05 - 38:08)
can open it every three days like this (38:06 - 38:10)
is the cycle of pokemon go so it's very (38:08 - 38:12)
hard for me to be like (38:10 - 38:14)
this is this is mega evolution (38:12 - 38:16)
implemented in this game is bad well i (38:14 - 38:17)
do think it's bad (38:16 - 38:21)
but i i also know that like (38:17 - 38:24)
they're trying to add (38:21 - 38:27)
some length to their game so people (38:24 - 38:29)
don't finish it in two days and then (38:27 - 38:29)
comp (38:29 - 38:31)
then i have a different complaint of (38:29 - 38:32)
there's nothing to do right they have to (38:31 - 38:33)
find this balance (38:32 - 38:37)
from you before but it's really easy to (38:33 - 38:40)
look at them as being the same block (38:37 - 38:41)
and they're generally not the same (38:40 - 38:42)
people that are complaining about the (38:41 - 38:43)
same things (38:42 - 38:45)
yeah yeah that's true unmask when you're (38:43 - 38:47)
like oh god all we all we ever do is (38:45 - 38:48)
hear from pokemon fans that they hate (38:47 - 38:49)
this or they hate that (38:48 - 38:51)
they're generally different people that (38:49 - 38:53)
have very different complaints (38:51 - 38:55)
and you'll never you know it's really (38:53 - 38:58)
hard to keep them separate because (38:55 - 39:00)
a lot of you a lot of people are just (38:58 - 39:01)
often yelling at you and you're like i (39:00 - 39:02)
don't even know who you are and i can't (39:01 - 39:04)
i can't i gotta get away (39:02 - 39:08)
but this i i would have to agree (39:04 - 39:11)
even if i can get energy more easily (39:08 - 39:14)
later i still don't like the fact that (39:11 - 39:14)
it's not (39:14 - 39:18)
a one and done process i still don't (39:14 - 39:20)
like the fact that i have to generate (39:18 - 39:23)
50 energy if i want to use this again (39:20 - 39:25)
it but doesn't personally affect me i (39:23 - 39:27)
will probably never collect them (39:25 - 39:30)
or i will i don't care um i don't care (39:27 - 39:31)
about collecting it's not (39:30 - 39:34)
hard same attitude greg thank you (39:31 - 39:39)
but i can see people who who do (39:34 - 39:43)
and that it is a frustrating (39:39 - 39:45)
implementation i mean it (39:43 - 39:47)
i think what gets frustrating is when (39:45 - 39:48)
you can see (39:47 - 39:52)
the mechanics of greed behind the (39:48 - 39:53)
process (39:52 - 39:56)
right like remote raids at least doesn't (39:53 - 39:56)
feel (39:56 - 39:59)
as bad because they needed a solution to (39:56 - 40:01)
allow us to do something in a unique (39:59 - 40:01)
period (40:01 - 40:04)
and like that felt like you're answering (40:01 - 40:06)
a need (40:04 - 40:08)
this is just we need to a extend the (40:06 - 40:09)
life of the game and b (40:08 - 40:12)
get you to pay more money there's so (40:09 - 40:14)
much tunnel vision with raids though (40:12 - 40:16)
people act like they're paying a dollar (40:14 - 40:17)
to get (40:16 - 40:20)
just pure pure energy and you're not (40:17 - 40:20)
right (40:20 - 40:23)
when you're doing a mega (40:20 - 40:27)
egg raid weird thing to say (40:23 - 40:29)
or if you're doing a five-star raid (40:27 - 40:30)
you're getting way more than the (40:29 - 40:32)
opportunity of (40:30 - 40:36)
finding of the one thing they want (40:32 - 40:38)
and i guess this is the frustrating part (40:36 - 40:39)
that i see (40:38 - 40:41)
is people are you know in in the sense (40:39 - 40:42)
of like heatran (40:41 - 40:45)
i i think i ended up spending like 25 (40:42 - 40:46)
right i did 25 raids (40:45 - 40:50)
and i got my shiny heatran and i was (40:46 - 40:52)
happy you know i in the in the sense of (40:50 - 40:54)
doing heatran not only did i have (40:52 - 40:57)
25 opportunities to catch heatran one of (40:54 - 40:58)
those being shiny (40:57 - 41:01)
i'm also getting experience i'm also (40:58 - 41:02)
getting stardust i'm (41:01 - 41:04)
also getting rare candy i'm also getting (41:02 - 41:05)
charged tms (41:04 - 41:08)
like i am getting so much from spending (41:05 - 41:09)
that dollar (41:08 - 41:11)
that i think most people kind of (41:09 - 41:13)
disregard and don't see that (41:11 - 41:16)
right i agree with you 100 percent right (41:13 - 41:16)
before (41:16 - 41:20)
go fest i had 770 some rare candy (41:16 - 41:23)
and i needed to spend that rare candy (41:20 - 41:24)
because otherwise gofest is gonna be (41:23 - 41:26)
awful because my bag was gonna be full (41:24 - 41:26)
so i put (41:26 - 41:28)
300 rare candy into like i don't know (41:26 - 41:30)
deoxys or something (41:28 - 41:31)
and then when i was doing the access (41:30 - 41:34)
raids after go fest i was back up to 800 (41:31 - 41:36)
rare candy and i didn't even realize it (41:34 - 41:38)
and i was like this is awesome i mean (41:36 - 41:39)
not awesome because i ended up (41:38 - 41:42)
well like awesome in the sense of like i (41:39 - 41:43)
forgot (41:42 - 41:45)
that raids give you so much rare candy (41:43 - 41:47)
and now i have more rare (41:45 - 41:49)
like there's more than than just like oh (41:47 - 41:51)
i'm spending a dollar to get 50 mega (41:49 - 41:52)
charizard candy (41:51 - 41:55)
or energy but i mean that's fine (41:52 - 41:57)
but that's also saying like i ordered a (41:55 - 41:59)
pizza and you gave me (41:57 - 42:02)
a free bucket of mushrooms i i don't (41:59 - 42:04)
care i'm never going to eat those (42:02 - 42:05)
mushrooms and now i have something that (42:04 - 42:06)
i have to deal with (42:05 - 42:09)
and throw them away like you can say oh (42:06 - 42:10)
you get all these great things with it (42:09 - 42:12)
if you never use them (42:10 - 42:15)
they are useless and worthless they are (42:12 - 42:16)
clogging (42:15 - 42:19)
up your bag space a crap you don't want (42:16 - 42:22)
and you you play a lot of various (42:19 - 42:24)
aspects of pokemon go (42:22 - 42:26)
and that's great a lot of people don't a (42:24 - 42:28)
lot of people have (42:26 - 42:31)
hundreds of raid candies that they will (42:28 - 42:32)
never ever use (42:31 - 42:34)
that is not going to interest them so (42:32 - 42:36)
that free thing (42:34 - 42:39)
isn't worth anything to them they don't (42:36 - 42:43)
care so you can't use that bonus (42:39 - 42:46)
as a value add if it's not actually (42:43 - 42:49)
adding any value to them and and i will (42:46 - 42:50)
say (42:49 - 42:53)
the what you have to keep in mind (42:50 - 42:55)
which is like what what nobody ever (42:53 - 42:56)
wants to keep in mind it's the same (42:55 - 42:57)
thing as (42:56 - 42:58)
what you have to keep in mind when you (42:57 - 43:00)
walk into a casino (42:58 - 43:02)
what you are paying for when you get a (43:00 - 43:03)
raid pass (43:02 - 43:06)
is an opportunity to do a raid you are (43:03 - 43:08)
not paying for (43:06 - 43:11)
a quad pokemon you are not paying for (43:08 - 43:13)
any guaranteed rewards because the (43:11 - 43:14)
rewards are randomized (43:13 - 43:17)
all you are paying for is the (43:14 - 43:18)
opportunity to do a raid (43:17 - 43:22)
so if financially this is a question you (43:18 - 43:25)
need to answer for yourself (43:22 - 43:29)
the value of doing a raid (43:25 - 43:32)
which is all you are paying for is not (43:29 - 43:34)
sufficient (43:32 - 43:37)
then you need to not spend the money (43:34 - 43:39)
because right the value for me in doing (43:37 - 43:40)
raids is (43:39 - 43:43)
one i can complain about steve yeah (43:40 - 43:46)
which gives me endless pleasure and joy (43:43 - 43:50)
or if i'm in person with people (43:46 - 43:53)
then my value of doing raids is driving (43:50 - 43:55)
around milwaukee with my friends (43:53 - 43:57)
trying or going at steve's bachelor (43:55 - 43:59)
party driving around the dells (43:57 - 44:01)
yeah or where going walking around (43:59 - 44:02)
chicago right (44:01 - 44:05)
that is nothing that i obtained from (44:02 - 44:06)
those raids (44:05 - 44:09)
has any value but the experience of (44:06 - 44:10)
being with my friends (44:09 - 44:14)
and that is what i am paying for yeah (44:10 - 44:18)
valid yeah i i agree i mean they uh so (44:14 - 44:20)
but going back to the raid thing they (44:18 - 44:22)
they took venusaur charizard blastoise (44:20 - 44:24)
they gave them the chance of being shiny (44:22 - 44:26)
i do think (44:24 - 44:29)
that there are different levels of raids (44:26 - 44:31)
they did get rid of two and four star (44:29 - 44:32)
raids by the way we didn't mention that (44:31 - 44:34)
in the news but there are only one star (44:32 - 44:36)
raids three star raids and (44:34 - 44:37)
five star raids now which i think when (44:36 - 44:39)
are they going to add a six star (44:37 - 44:42)
then learn from pokemon masters (44:39 - 44:43)
which which i think is i think is the (44:42 - 44:45)
right thing to do right you know you (44:43 - 44:47)
anyone could solo a one and two star (44:45 - 44:49)
pretty easily you could (44:47 - 44:51)
you know if you if you did invest your (44:49 - 44:53)
stardust and your rare candy and (44:51 - 44:55)
your charged tms you could probably do a (44:53 - 44:56)
three star pretty easily (44:55 - 44:58)
um very hard to do a four star but if (44:56 - 45:00)
you had another person or two (44:58 - 45:02)
easy to do a four star so i think the (45:00 - 45:03)
consolidation of just having one (45:02 - 45:06)
three and five is great but i i do think (45:03 - 45:08)
there are raids that have (45:06 - 45:12)
specific value for example (45:08 - 45:15)
would i spend a dollar on (45:12 - 45:18)
heatran whether it's my local heatran or (45:15 - 45:20)
a heatran (45:18 - 45:22)
you know out that somebody is inviting (45:20 - 45:23)
me to (45:22 - 45:25)
yes uh although i would argue that (45:23 - 45:27)
people were more willing to spend that (45:25 - 45:28)
dollar (45:27 - 45:30)
on rayquaza because we know that (45:28 - 45:32)
rayquaza is one of the best dragon type (45:30 - 45:33)
attackers and flying type attackers (45:32 - 45:34)
right (45:33 - 45:37)
but would i spend a dollar on shinks (45:34 - 45:38)
which is a one star yeah actually (45:37 - 45:40)
probably because i i want more shinx (45:38 - 45:41)
candy (45:40 - 45:43)
i want the chance of shiny shanks easy (45:41 - 45:45)
enough to do i can do it in 30 seconds i (45:43 - 45:46)
don't need to (45:45 - 45:48)
call anyone or text anyone so would i (45:46 - 45:50)
spend a dollar on shanks yes would i (45:48 - 45:52)
spend a dollar on heatran yes (45:50 - 45:55)
would i spend a dollar on mega charizard (45:52 - 45:58)
yeah probably i would probably if it was (45:55 - 45:59)
if i had a free raid pass i would do it (45:58 - 46:01)
a hundred percent if somebody invited me (45:59 - 46:03)
to it and they were like hey we really (46:01 - 46:05)
need a fourth or a fifth (46:03 - 46:07)
can you help us out yeah totally because (46:05 - 46:08)
if i'm ever in that situation i would (46:07 - 46:10)
want that person to return the favor (46:08 - 46:12)
would i spend a dollar on cladel or (46:10 - 46:14)
machamp or any of these other (46:12 - 46:17)
garbage raids that exist no like no (46:14 - 46:19)
i wouldn't can you do an infographic of (46:17 - 46:21)
which raids are worth a dollar and which (46:19 - 46:24)
ones are not because i'm i'm not in this (46:21 - 46:28)
world but the the dollar for (46:24 - 46:31)
mega evolution you're you're you're (46:28 - 46:32)
getting the rare candy you're getting (46:31 - 46:33)
the experience you're getting the (46:32 - 46:35)
stardust you're getting a chance to (46:33 - 46:37)
catch blastoise venus or charizard which (46:35 - 46:38)
most people probably don't need (46:37 - 46:40)
but you are getting the chance of (46:38 - 46:42)
catching a shiny version of them and (46:40 - 46:44)
you're getting the mega candy (46:42 - 46:46)
i don't know how they make that dollar (46:44 - 46:48)
worth more to you (46:46 - 46:51)
and i i don't even i i think the actual (46:48 - 46:53)
complaint probably comes down to (46:51 - 46:55)
spending energy (46:53 - 46:58)
to have it mega evolve again (46:55 - 47:00)
but i also think there's probably a (46:58 - 47:01)
mechanical thing (47:00 - 47:04)
of well if we don't have something to (47:01 - 47:06)
trigger (47:04 - 47:07)
then people are just going to run megas (47:06 - 47:09)
all the time (47:07 - 47:11)
maybe they and i'm assuming they don't (47:09 - 47:12)
want that right i'm assuming they just (47:11 - 47:14)
don't want people to use megas all the (47:12 - 47:15)
time (47:14 - 47:17)
slash they want magus to feel special (47:15 - 47:19)
and there's a balance there and i don't (47:17 - 47:20)
think they got the balance right (47:19 - 47:22)
which is my complaint which is also my (47:20 - 47:24)
complaint but i don't know how they fix (47:22 - 47:25)
that balance (47:24 - 47:26)
the other thing i saw is people were (47:25 - 47:28)
frustrated that (47:26 - 47:30)
the mega evolution lasted for four hours (47:28 - 47:32)
and i saw some people suggesting they (47:30 - 47:34)
should last for 24 hours (47:32 - 47:37)
why who's playing pokemon go 24 like who (47:34 - 47:38)
is playing pokemon (47:37 - 47:41)
go for more than four hours and like (47:38 - 47:42)
well (47:41 - 47:45)
like even on a raid day that's when i (47:42 - 47:46)
would be like hey i'm gonna pop mega (47:45 - 47:47)
venusaur (47:46 - 47:51)
we're gonna take out some uh milotics (47:47 - 47:53)
uh i'm going to run mega venusaur for (47:51 - 47:55)
the next four hours (47:53 - 47:57)
yeah i can see that situation i can't (47:55 - 47:59)
see a situation where it's like 12 hours (47:57 - 48:00)
long and i'm doing like one (47:59 - 48:02)
raid every 12 hours and i'm like well (48:00 - 48:03)
good thing i got mega (48:02 - 48:07)
like only the most hardcore (48:03 - 48:09)
of p like the people who are doing you (48:07 - 48:11)
know a hundred plus raids a week (48:09 - 48:14)
are probably want that but also like (48:11 - 48:16)
what rates are they (48:14 - 48:19)
i just like i don't think the four hours (48:16 - 48:19)
is (48:19 - 48:21)
actually the problem even though i keep (48:19 - 48:22)
seeing people say like oh it should be (48:21 - 48:24)
longer than four hours (48:22 - 48:26)
like are you actually playing pokemon go (48:24 - 48:27)
that much in an entire day (48:26 - 48:29)
like i play pokemon go every day don't (48:27 - 48:31)
get me wrong and i normally play like (48:29 - 48:32)
if it's like a saturday and i'm going (48:31 - 48:34)
for a walk that's normally like an hour (48:32 - 48:35)
to two hours (48:34 - 48:37)
if there's an event like tuesday night (48:35 - 48:38)
i'm normally playing for an hour two (48:37 - 48:39)
hours (48:38 - 48:40)
i don't think there's ever been a (48:39 - 48:43)
situation where i'm like let's play for (48:40 - 48:44)
four hours on a not like (48:43 - 48:46)
there's nothing happening today when (48:44 - 48:47)
we're recording this on a sunday i don't (48:46 - 48:48)
think i'm just being like let's play (48:47 - 48:50)
four hours today greg like that's not (48:48 - 48:53)
happening unless maybe there was an (48:50 - 48:53)
event (48:53 - 48:57)
so i don't think that like the four-hour (48:53 - 49:00)
limit is the actual problem we should be (48:57 - 49:01)
arguing about (49:00 - 49:03)
i just don't like okay here here's the (49:01 - 49:04)
question (49:03 - 49:07)
if you don't hit the full four hours (49:04 - 49:10)
like if you shut the game down is it (49:07 - 49:12)
four hours of play time or is it just (49:10 - 49:14)
four hours period it's four hours it's (49:12 - 49:16)
just like a lucky egg you turn it on and (49:14 - 49:18)
whether you're playing or not the thing (49:16 - 49:20)
is clicking down (49:18 - 49:23)
so in that way i could see last the (49:20 - 49:24)
argument for lasting 24 hours (49:23 - 49:26)
because they're not saying i'm playing (49:24 - 49:28)
for 24 hours it's (49:26 - 49:30)
if i play for an hour and then i have to (49:28 - 49:31)
go to (49:30 - 49:33)
do a bunch of stuff tomorrow morning i (49:31 - 49:34)
would like to be able to come up and (49:33 - 49:37)
play for my hour or play for my (49:34 - 49:39)
15 minutes in the morning and still have (49:37 - 49:40)
that available to me (49:39 - 49:42)
yeah agreed right yeah but like if i (49:40 - 49:44)
only played half an hour you need (49:42 - 49:46)
mega venusaur on for like one raid and (49:44 - 49:47)
then like (49:46 - 49:48)
seven hours later you're like i gotta (49:47 - 49:50)
get this other raiden with mega venusaur (49:48 - 49:51)
like that's just (49:50 - 49:53)
you can do any raid without mega venus (49:51 - 49:54)
or like we've (49:53 - 49:57)
established that but we've also (49:54 - 49:58)
established the (49:57 - 50:00)
only thing people like collecting for (49:58 - 50:03)
showing it off to people (50:00 - 50:05)
i mean that's that's the only part of it (50:03 - 50:07)
they would like to have it (50:05 - 50:08)
in their next raid the next morning for (50:07 - 50:11)
a whole new group of people to see (50:08 - 50:14)
yeah i can't argue yeah they want to (50:11 - 50:15)
show it off yeah i guess i can't argue (50:14 - 50:18)
with that (50:15 - 50:18)
i don't think mega evolution is great (50:19 - 50:24)
but i (50:22 - 50:26)
i don't know how i would fix it though (50:24 - 50:27)
yeah i don't know either (50:26 - 50:29)
i mean i well i would make it a (50:27 - 50:30)
one-and-done thing (50:29 - 50:32)
for sure i do think if you're just (50:30 - 50:34)
trying to complete them for your decks (50:32 - 50:37)
i think it's very easy to do it free you (50:34 - 50:39)
can get it done in less than a month (50:37 - 50:42)
i wouldn't stress about it too much i i (50:39 - 50:42)
don't know (50:42 - 50:46)
it's interesting yeah yeah yeah (50:42 - 50:48)
but yeah (50:46 - 50:48)
it sounded like that entire time i was (50:49 - 50:53)
defending it but i i just (50:51 - 50:57)
i i also just don't care about it (50:53 - 50:59)
like i've been no rush to get these (50:57 - 51:01)
megas well (50:59 - 51:03)
let's take a break when we come back (51:01 - 51:05)
we'll do a little bit of masters (51:03 - 51:08)

fan of the disco season (51:56 - 52:01)
i just i don't enjoy disco um and i'm (51:58 - 52:03)
completely skipping the whole (52:01 - 52:05)
decorate your garden italian style but (52:03 - 52:07)

version of pokemon masters (52:22 - 52:29)
uh sure (52:25 - 52:31)
except there's no property brothers so (52:29 - 52:33)
on gardenscapes do you have to (52:31 - 52:35)

game (52:48 - 52:53)
not their horrible horrible advertising (52:49 - 52:54)
tactics that literally (52:53 - 52:58)
every other game company has now assumed (52:54 - 53:00)
as their own tactics if you if you (52:58 - 53:01)

pokemon masters is one year old to (53:28 - 53:31)
celebrate this (53:30 - 53:35)

to claim your special gift (54:05 - 54:09)
before though that though check out some (54:07 - 54:10)
more (54:09 - 54:12)
details accompanying pokemon masters we (54:10 - 54:15)
went through a lot of these last week (54:12 - 54:17)
uh the two changes that they did we (54:15 - 54:19)
didn't talk about last week and i (54:17 - 54:21)
recall greg that we both said that it (54:19 - 54:23)
felt like it was a little bit (54:21 - 54:25)
underwhelming you know they did do a lot (54:23 - 54:27)
but i just felt like they should have (54:25 - 54:28)
done more for the one year (54:27 - 54:31)
uh they yeah they added some stuff uh so (54:28 - 54:33)
they (54:31 - 54:36)
maybe dna listening to the show uh when (54:33 - 54:37)
you do a (54:36 - 54:40)
and you do a 10-pole now uh you get (54:37 - 54:42)
11 poles instead i don't think that's a (54:40 - 54:43)
permanent change (54:42 - 54:46)
i think that's i think it's temporary (54:43 - 54:47)
and (54:46 - 54:49)
still doesn't feel good when you get 11 (54:47 - 54:50)
3 stars (54:49 - 54:53)
still stinks that happened to you (54:50 - 54:54)
although it'll probably happen to me i (54:53 - 54:56)
haven't done an 11 pole yet (54:54 - 54:59)
i know a person that has uh (54:56 - 55:03)
getting sigma suit leaf broke my (54:59 - 55:06)
streak of that was my 50th pull of all (55:03 - 55:07)
threes (55:06 - 55:10)
like i had gotten 353 stars in a row and (55:07 - 55:12)
finally (55:10 - 55:15)
leaf broke my broke my terrible tears no (55:12 - 55:15)
10 (55:15 - 55:19)
chance of getting a five star yeah (55:15 - 55:22)
that ten percent is on every choice (55:19 - 55:24)
right like you you are the person that (55:22 - 55:26)
sits on twitch and screams about shiny (55:24 - 55:27)
odds (55:26 - 55:30)
yeah no i'm just giving you a hard time (55:27 - 55:32)
and i stayed up 50 pulls like only (55:30 - 55:33)
getting three stars (55:32 - 55:37)
is also a percent chance (55:33 - 55:37)
so we talked about last week how there (55:37 - 55:42)
was um that cigna suit cynthia was like (55:39 - 55:44)
the new character and then on september (55:42 - 55:45)
3rd there's like a (55:44 - 55:48)
silhouette of like new character coming (55:45 - 55:49)
and then it's like september 10th (55:48 - 55:50)
there's another new character (55:49 - 55:52)
so a lot of people guessed that this (55:50 - 55:54)
might have been leaf and blue (55:52 - 55:57)
but they're not uh but leaf and blue (55:54 - 55:58)
came (55:57 - 56:01)
so uh they brought back red leaf (55:58 - 56:04)
is now in the game and a cigna suit leaf (56:01 - 56:06)
i'm sorry i forgot (56:04 - 56:08)
that leaf has been in the game with an (56:06 - 56:09)
eevee and i (56:08 - 56:12)
pulled a leaf but it was not the signa (56:09 - 56:13)
suit leaf everybody forgot that there (56:12 - 56:15)
was the bad version even i forgot i'm (56:13 - 56:16)
like wait there's another version (56:15 - 56:18)
oh it's the one that nobody likes and (56:16 - 56:20)
nobody cares about uh (56:18 - 56:23)
and then cigna suit blue is now in the (56:20 - 56:25)
game and there's a banner for lance i'm (56:23 - 56:26)
not why is there a banner for lance (56:25 - 56:28)
right now (56:26 - 56:30)
because people missed it because of the (56:28 - 56:31)
kanto well because of the kanto (56:30 - 56:33)
championship oh because of the champion (56:31 - 56:34)
that makes sense (56:33 - 56:35)
and then there's cynthia so we're (56:34 - 56:37)
supposed to still get another (56:35 - 56:39)
new character soon and then another (56:37 - 56:41)
character after that (56:39 - 56:44)
uh so there's there is a lot i guess (56:41 - 56:46)
like holding leaf and blue was probably (56:44 - 56:49)
a nice surprise i mean surprised me yeah (56:46 - 56:50)
i (56:49 - 56:51)
it's weird that they're not on the same (56:50 - 56:53)
banner is (56:51 - 56:55)
that's what i was gonna ask you is this (56:53 - 56:56)
so there are three banners (56:55 - 56:59)
if you don't know what a banner is in (56:56 - 57:00)
pokemon masters (56:59 - 57:04)
you can choose a a (57:00 - 57:08)
loot box let's say to open (57:04 - 57:11)
so one loot box will include red and (57:08 - 57:12)
then a bunch of other old (57:11 - 57:14)
five stars and then another loot box (57:12 - 57:16)
will open will have (57:14 - 57:18)
leaf and then all the older five stars (57:16 - 57:20)
so if you open a leaf (57:18 - 57:22)
loot box you have no chance of pulling (57:20 - 57:24)
red (57:22 - 57:25)
just like if you open a red loot box you (57:24 - 57:27)
have no chance of pulling signa suit (57:25 - 57:28)
leaf (57:27 - 57:32)
but leaf red and blue are two percent so (57:28 - 57:33)
a 1 in 50 chance (57:32 - 57:37)
of getting in said loot box (57:33 - 57:39)
is it better that they split them out (57:37 - 57:40)
because if you don't care about red and (57:39 - 57:41)
blue which (57:40 - 57:42)
there probably are some people that only (57:41 - 57:44)
care about leaf that's good (57:42 - 57:46)
you can only pull on leaf then whereas (57:44 - 57:48)
if they were all in one (57:46 - 57:51)
you might not get it (57:48 - 57:53)
yeah i would say that that was true if (57:51 - 57:55)
you didn't need to pull duplicates to (57:53 - 57:56)
power them up (57:55 - 57:59)
in this game right and (57:56 - 58:02)
having them on their own separate banner (57:59 - 58:05)
means the odds of getting something from (58:02 - 58:07)
from that banner are (58:05 - 58:09)
even lower so if they were two percent (58:07 - 58:10)
each (58:09 - 58:12)
on one banner it would feel like hey (58:10 - 58:13)
i've got a solid (58:12 - 58:15)
chance of actually pulling one of these (58:13 - 58:18)
characters in this method it's like i (58:15 - 58:19)
don't have a great chance of pulling (58:18 - 58:21)
either of these characters plus i have (58:19 - 58:24)
to choose which one i need (58:21 - 58:25)
which means most people are just gonna (58:24 - 58:27)
stick on red because it's already been (58:25 - 58:29)
released and you have the best chance of (58:27 - 58:30)
getting duplicates (58:29 - 58:32)
which is kind of a garbagey way of (58:30 - 58:34)
releasing them do you really think you (58:32 - 58:35)
need to pull three i mean i've (58:34 - 58:37)
just pulled one of a lot of things and (58:35 - 58:40)
i've been pretty fine playing the game (58:37 - 58:43)
yeah you can (58:40 - 58:46)
until we see fully how expert (58:43 - 58:47)
championship (58:46 - 58:50)
plays out sure but there's no (58:47 - 58:54)
doubt that having a fully fleshed out (58:50 - 58:57)
five uh five sink level is way better (58:54 - 58:58)
than having a one (58:57 - 59:01)
yeah sure yeah the numbers do go up i (58:58 - 59:03)
mean like look at the skyla problem and (59:01 - 59:04)
you know (59:03 - 59:07)
that that's you know it's a problem of (59:04 - 59:08)
how they (59:07 - 59:10)
made the game with the six star (59:08 - 59:12)
possibility well they added the one new (59:10 - 59:13)
thing where (59:12 - 59:16)
um you don't need to pull like five sink (59:13 - 59:17)
pairs now (59:16 - 59:19)
you can like merge that new currency (59:17 - 59:21)
into a forced sink pair (59:19 - 59:22)
i don't remember what that's called (59:21 - 59:26)
though is it the type thing (59:22 - 59:26)
maybe the the type there's a lot of (59:27 - 59:32)
moving parts and masters there's too (59:30 - 59:34)
many moving parts and masters (59:32 - 59:37)
see and and it's still real time just (59:34 - 59:39)
make it not real time no no no no no no (59:37 - 59:41)
the real time (59:39 - 59:44)
just turn autobattle on no (59:41 - 59:46)
then what is the point of playing the (59:44 - 59:48)
game and autobahn is still bad (59:46 - 59:51)
i'm sending my robot after their robot (59:48 - 59:54)
no that's not fun (59:51 - 59:56)
you know sometimes you sometimes you're (59:54 - 59:58)
like i know i can beat this i'm gonna (59:56 - 59:59)
turn on all the battle run to the (59:58 - 60:01)
bathroom come back oh it's done (59:59 - 60:04)
yeah no no no no no (60:01 - 60:08)
i mobile games are my reason for going (60:04 - 60:08)
to the back (60:08 - 60:13)
is garden escapes is gardenscapes turn (60:08 - 60:15)
based i don't think so (60:13 - 60:18)
it certainly is it's a match three you (60:15 - 60:19)
take your turns yes (60:18 - 60:22)
it's type skills right type skills is (60:19 - 60:24)
what (60:22 - 60:26)
yeah raises them yeah i'm pretty sure (60:24 - 60:27)
yeah right so you don't (60:26 - 60:29)
need to pull three you don't need to (60:27 - 60:31)
pull a million scalas now well (60:29 - 60:33)
i mean scala was free and then they did (60:31 - 60:35)
the scala event (60:33 - 60:38)
but like me i i only have one of (60:35 - 60:40)
l i only have one skyla and skyla has (60:38 - 60:42)
been vip (60:40 - 60:44)
mvp on my team and i only have one of it (60:42 - 60:47)
but there's a way to get skyla to three (60:44 - 60:50)
no i have three skyles because i have i (60:47 - 60:52)
have most of her sink grid (60:50 - 60:54)
but i could get her to five by not (60:52 - 60:55)
pulling any (60:54 - 60:57)
but by merging some currency that they (60:55 - 60:58)
have now which is new (60:57 - 61:02)
yeah yeah the types the type thing (60:58 - 61:04)
they brought back the mew and professor (61:02 - 61:05)
oak event (61:04 - 61:08)
yep which was very easy to get professor (61:05 - 61:10)
oak to 125. i don't know why they (61:08 - 61:12)
brought that back (61:10 - 61:14)
or like why it was auto like my bingo (61:12 - 61:15)
win they brought back (61:14 - 61:17)
yeah professor oak your bingo card was (61:15 - 61:18)
like automatically done right (61:17 - 61:20)
because you already did it yeah um the (61:18 - 61:21)
reason why they brought it back (61:20 - 61:24)
again is because the kanto champions cup (61:21 - 61:27)
right like it's all kanto-based (61:24 - 61:30)
because that's the first champions cup (61:27 - 61:31)
yeah (61:30 - 61:33)
i mean it's the first sigma suits it's (61:31 - 61:35)
like it's the big kanto event (61:33 - 61:37)
so they've brought back all the cantoey (61:35 - 61:39)
things i think they said that you get a (61:37 - 61:41)
total of like 7 (61:39 - 61:43)
600 gems because of the anniversary so (61:41 - 61:44)
you get the 3 000 (61:43 - 61:47)
bonus and then if you log in every day (61:44 - 61:48)
you get like another 3 (61:47 - 61:52)
600 when it all eventually adds up um (61:48 - 61:55)
and then you still get your 150 a week (61:52 - 61:58)
from you know 50 on tuesdays and 100 on (61:55 - 61:59)
fri (61:58 - 62:02)
whatever the that daily login is (61:59 - 62:06)
yeah you get 200 stamina guaranteed (62:02 - 62:08)
which is also part of the event (62:06 - 62:10)
which is made made it feel a lot like (62:08 - 62:12)
when they first rolled out stamina (62:10 - 62:15)
yep it's like it's like it brought you (62:12 - 62:16)
back to when it was fun (62:15 - 62:19)
and they're gonna take it away and there (62:16 - 62:22)
is a one-year anniversary gem special (62:19 - 62:23)
but they seem (62:22 - 62:25)
identical to the lead up so i'm a little (62:23 - 62:27)
bummed that they weren't allowed (62:25 - 62:28)
i was hoping it was going to be slightly (62:27 - 62:30)
cheaper but (62:28 - 62:32)
great they're not great prices it was (62:30 - 62:33)
the same as the lead-up (62:32 - 62:37)
uh which is a little bit of a bummer (62:33 - 62:40)
um yeah do you wanna we we talked about (62:37 - 62:42)
this on on stream last night greg (62:40 - 62:45)
uh yeah of gems being expensive so right (62:42 - 62:46)
now you can (62:45 - 62:50)
you can get 14 000 gems for 80 (62:46 - 62:53)
usd uh which is just (62:50 - 62:56)
which is about 50 pulls a little short (62:53 - 62:59)
of 50 poles i think it's like 47 poles (62:56 - 63:01)
i guess technically 50 is it with the (62:59 - 63:03)
with the (63:01 - 63:03)
um that is their that's their discounted (63:03 - 63:08)
rate you could buy that three times if (63:06 - 63:09)
you wanted to which is (63:08 - 63:12)
over 200 but what (63:09 - 63:15)
uh we can compare this to we compared (63:12 - 63:17)
this to dragalgia loss which is (63:15 - 63:20)
an another nintendo i i guess not yes (63:17 - 63:22)
shouldn't say another nintendo we do (63:20 - 63:23)
know that nintendo owns a stake in the (63:22 - 63:25)
pokemon company the pokemon company (63:23 - 63:27)
pokemon masters you know dna (63:25 - 63:29)
uh the closest thing i think we can (63:27 - 63:30)
compare it to (63:29 - 63:32)
yeah maybe fire emblem heroes as well (63:30 - 63:34)
but what what is our what is our (63:32 - 63:37)
gem difference there so we were (63:34 - 63:39)
comparing non-discounted prices (63:37 - 63:43)
right so being able to do a one a ten (63:39 - 63:43)
poll (63:43 - 63:46)
in pokemon masters is 28.99 (63:43 - 63:49)
being able to do the same 10 poll in (63:46 - 63:50)
regalia lost (63:49 - 63:53)
is 23.99 okay so there's a not (63:50 - 63:55)
discounted so there's a five dollar (63:53 - 63:56)
difference (63:55 - 63:59)
which what i suggested and i think you (63:56 - 64:01)
agreed with was that is (63:59 - 64:04)
the five dollar pokemon tax correct it (64:01 - 64:06)
is a five dollar pokemon tax the (64:04 - 64:10)
the difference i think the reason why so (64:06 - 64:12)
here's the biggest difference between (64:10 - 64:13)
the two games (64:12 - 64:16)
i never feel like i (64:13 - 64:19)
have to purchase anything in regalia (64:16 - 64:20)
lost (64:19 - 64:24)
they are very steady (64:20 - 64:27)
and i would say generous but they are (64:24 - 64:29)
more generous than pokemon masters (64:27 - 64:33)
at giving you gems that you can stoop (64:29 - 64:36)
ten polls with so i usually can do (64:33 - 64:39)
one full ten pull with a guarantee of (64:36 - 64:40)
getting something good (64:39 - 64:44)
masters um like every two weeks (64:40 - 64:46)
just by playing the game you get a (64:44 - 64:48)
steady clip of the gyms coming (64:46 - 64:51)
they for completing their existing (64:48 - 64:51)
events (64:51 - 64:54)
for completing their story for login (64:51 - 64:55)
bonuses (64:54 - 64:58)
they keep you steadily in gems so that (64:55 - 64:58)
you never (64:58 - 65:02)
feel like oh this banner is going to (64:58 - 65:04)
go by and i won't have enough to do a (65:02 - 65:06)
10-pole to try to get something (65:04 - 65:10)
decent from it masters doesn't do that (65:06 - 65:12)
masters also calls them the same thing (65:10 - 65:14)
which is super frustrating (65:12 - 65:18)
but masters is very stingy (65:14 - 65:21)
with giving you free gems to do polls (65:18 - 65:24)
so you could and the fact that you're (65:21 - 65:26)
not guaranteed something decent on their (65:24 - 65:27)
ten poll (65:26 - 65:29)
so they are very much on this drip feed (65:27 - 65:30)
well i'll pull (65:29 - 65:33)
once on this banner and hope that it's (65:30 - 65:35)
good and then i'll wait (65:33 - 65:38)
you know two weeks because like monday (65:35 - 65:39)
and (65:38 - 65:40)
you know tuesday friday you get 150 it (65:39 - 65:42)
takes two weeks to get 300 to do one (65:40 - 65:44)
poll (65:42 - 65:47)
it it it's really they're really not (65:44 - 65:51)
great at making the poll system feel (65:47 - 65:53)
good and it's more expensive do you (65:51 - 65:54)
think guaranteeing one (65:53 - 65:57)
four star in a ten poll is is makes it (65:54 - 65:58)
feel any better though (65:57 - 66:02)
yeah absolutely all right because you're (65:58 - 66:02)
getting (66:02 - 66:05)
because four stars are so much better (66:02 - 66:07)
than three stars right (66:05 - 66:09)
like those pairs are just simply going (66:07 - 66:10)
to make the game better and easier to (66:09 - 66:11)
use (66:10 - 66:13)
and it's also going to allow you to get (66:11 - 66:15)
your favorite four star pair if you're (66:13 - 66:16)
getting duplicates (66:15 - 66:18)
up to a five star like it makes that (66:16 - 66:20)
process better without guaranteeing (66:18 - 66:21)
getting a (66:20 - 66:24)
a four star you have to rely on luck to (66:21 - 66:26)
get one that you've already maxed out (66:24 - 66:29)
to get enough of the power up thing (66:26 - 66:31)
to be able to turn somebody into a five (66:29 - 66:32)
star and so (66:31 - 66:35)
those those upgrades seem almost (66:32 - 66:36)
unachievable (66:35 - 66:39)
because of how slow that system goes (66:36 - 66:41)
whereas in the other one i'm like oh i (66:39 - 66:42)
really like this character they're very (66:41 - 66:43)
powerful (66:42 - 66:44)
and because i've pulled a couple of (66:43 - 66:46)
times and had a bunch of duplicates (66:44 - 66:49)
i can promote them right now i (66:46 - 66:50)
want to be able to promote them (66:49 - 66:52)
immediately i can get them to a five (66:50 - 66:52)
star (66:52 - 66:55)
and it unlocks an entire different like (66:52 - 66:57)
power up system which (66:55 - 66:58)
there's a bunch of different things (66:57 - 67:00)
indoli lost at least they do a good job (66:58 - 67:01)
of explaining them to you (67:00 - 67:04)
but like i feel that none of my poles (67:01 - 67:05)
are wasted (67:04 - 67:07)
because they're going into a generic (67:05 - 67:09)
pool and (67:07 - 67:14)
i can use them almost immediately but (67:09 - 67:16)
you are also guaranteed to get good (67:14 - 67:16)
things (67:16 - 67:20)
so like you just it just feels fun to (67:16 - 67:21)
always pull on their banners and that's (67:20 - 67:23)
something that masters lacks (67:21 - 67:26)
don't think that polls would get any (67:23 - 67:27)
cheaper (67:26 - 67:30)
although i i i i hope they keep the 11th (67:27 - 67:31)
pole (67:30 - 67:34)
i i think removing that is like if they (67:31 - 67:35)
keep the 11th pull (67:34 - 67:37)
that that solves the guaranteed (67:35 - 67:39)
four-star problem (67:37 - 67:40)
right because then there is a reason to (67:39 - 67:42)
pull on a tent right because they want (67:40 - 67:44)
an extra bonus yeah you want a reason to (67:42 - 67:45)
save (67:44 - 67:48)
although you could argue like well if i (67:45 - 67:48)
only (67:48 - 67:51)
pull single pole and i get you know (67:48 - 67:53)
sigma suit cynthia first try now i've (67:51 - 67:56)
just saved nine poles (67:53 - 67:58)
you could argue that i mean you could i (67:56 - 68:00)
mean but that goes back to the fact that (67:58 - 68:03)
that polling duplicates is generally bad (68:00 - 68:04)
in this game (68:03 - 68:06)
because you you don't have a you don't (68:04 - 68:08)
have a great conversion system (68:06 - 68:10)
in place to to make use of those (68:08 - 68:11)
duplicates (68:10 - 68:14)
and i was thinking of like i feel like (68:11 - 68:15)
there's no way they make (68:14 - 68:18)
any of this cheaper because like there's (68:15 - 68:20)
other games like apex legends where (68:18 - 68:22)
people that was like the biggest (68:20 - 68:25)
complaint for over a year for apex was (68:22 - 68:26)
the store is too expensive if you don't (68:25 - 68:27)
know (68:26 - 68:30)
apex legend is completely free uh if you (68:27 - 68:31)
want to spend money in it you can buy (68:30 - 68:32)
like (68:31 - 68:34)
gun skins or character skins and they're (68:32 - 68:36)
i'm not exaggerating it is (68:34 - 68:39)
about 18 to buy character skin all it (68:36 - 68:40)
does is change the way your character (68:39 - 68:41)
looks (68:40 - 68:45)
or 18 to change the the way your gun (68:41 - 68:46)
looks (68:45 - 68:48)
they don't not pay to win they don't do (68:46 - 68:49)
anything (68:48 - 68:51)
and i to myself you know we were talking (68:49 - 68:52)
about raid passes (68:51 - 68:54)
earlier and is like is a mega charizard (68:52 - 68:56)
worth a dollar (68:54 - 69:01)
i think yeah sure it is um i cannot (68:56 - 69:04)
maybe if i can maybe like one skin out (69:01 - 69:05)
of a thousand i'd be like heck yeah (69:04 - 69:07)
that's worth 18 bucks but i've never (69:05 - 69:08)
purchased a skin (69:07 - 69:11)
or a gun skin in that game because 18 (69:08 - 69:15)
for a skin is is i think outrageous (69:11 - 69:18)
i would maybe at most pay 10 but (69:15 - 69:20)
i'd probably be more willing to buy (69:18 - 69:22)
skins if they were five and (69:20 - 69:26)
how much is the skin worth in destiny uh (69:22 - 69:28)
i think destiny's well destiny doesn't (69:26 - 69:29)
happen (69:28 - 69:31)
they have armor how much have you paid (69:29 - 69:34)
oh well so (69:31 - 69:36)
emotes and the emotes were i think about (69:34 - 69:38)
five dollars a piece and i was buying a (69:36 - 69:39)
lot of the emotes because (69:38 - 69:45)
what if it was a pax west exclusive (69:39 - 69:45)
was the most i paid for that i think the (69:45 - 69:48)
most i've paid for (69:47 - 69:52)
uh emblem was like 20 25. (69:48 - 69:54)
that's more than 18. more than 18 yeah (69:52 - 69:57)
but in destiny i was dedicated to (69:54 - 69:58)
collecting (69:57 - 70:00)
every single thing destiny was like my (69:58 - 70:02)
space pokemon (70:00 - 70:03)
i was very dedicated to completing that (70:02 - 70:05)
that's true (70:03 - 70:08)
as much as i love apex i i (70:05 - 70:10)
there's not been a trigger where i felt (70:08 - 70:12)
compelled to collect all the skins for (70:10 - 70:14)
all the characters (70:12 - 70:17)
um i mean but this is like skin (70:14 - 70:20)
prices are not (70:17 - 70:24)
unusual like final fantasies (70:20 - 70:26)
outrageous prices for clothing yeah well (70:24 - 70:28)
i paid the box station (70:26 - 70:32)
20 for that mount but i could put two (70:28 - 70:33)
people in it made it different than a (70:32 - 70:34)
single person mount (70:33 - 70:36)
i could put two people then you could (70:34 - 70:37)
get the fork (70:36 - 70:41)
the four oh i got the car i got the car (70:37 - 70:43)
um well and now you know you know that (70:41 - 70:45)
cart they have at the beginning (70:43 - 70:46)
that when you play the game and you're (70:45 - 70:48)
in that stupid cart oh (70:46 - 70:50)
that thing yeah yeah yeah you can buy (70:48 - 70:51)
you can buy that in the box i'm (70:50 - 70:53)
interested in that okay but for example (70:51 - 70:55)
for example i would just (70:53 - 70:58)
just say like an outfit in final fantasy (70:55 - 70:58)
right (70:58 - 71:01)
now is 18 and it is just clothing (70:58 - 71:03)
the the only thing i'm bringing up is i (71:01 - 71:04)
don't think gems ever are going to get (71:03 - 71:05)
cheaper in masters (71:04 - 71:08)
i think 300 for a pollen whatever much (71:05 - 71:09)
however much (71:08 - 71:11)
300 well right now they're running a (71:09 - 71:12)
special where you could pay a dollar to (71:11 - 71:14)
get 300 gems which is ideally three (71:12 - 71:16)
polls if you're doing the daily (71:14 - 71:18)
the daily poll thing they're not going (71:16 - 71:19)
to get cheaper uh (71:18 - 71:21)
it's it's never gotten cheaper in apex i (71:19 - 71:23)
i think it's only gotten more expensive (71:21 - 71:24)
in final fantasy i don't remember ever (71:23 - 71:26)
seeing an eighteen dollar (71:24 - 71:29)
outfit in final fantasy but (71:26 - 71:32)
i hope they keep the 11th poll i think (71:29 - 71:34)
that would be good for the game (71:32 - 71:37)
i think it would i think it would help (71:34 - 71:40)
the non-guarantee issue problem (71:37 - 71:43)
yes i agree the last thing i want to (71:40 - 71:45)
talk about is the gem bundle which they (71:43 - 71:47)
rolled out maybe like two or three weeks (71:45 - 71:48)
ago (71:47 - 71:50)
or they rolled it out i think when the (71:48 - 71:52)
stamina system came out (71:50 - 71:56)
uh it's 7.99 and then what it does is (71:52 - 72:00)
um it gives you 500 page gems right away (71:56 - 72:03)
it does a sync orb reward boost for 20 (72:00 - 72:04)
days (72:03 - 72:09)
and then you get a thousand non-paid (72:04 - 72:11)
gems every time you log in so you get 50 (72:09 - 72:13)
every time you log in until i eat a (72:11 - 72:15)
thousand which i think is 20 days (72:13 - 72:17)
and then you get um 10 skip tickets (72:15 - 72:19)
every day you log in for 20 days which (72:17 - 72:20)
is 200 (72:19 - 72:23)
uh and it's 7.99 and i almost did it (72:20 - 72:24)
until i realized (72:23 - 72:28)
that the the 50 you get a day (72:24 - 72:31)
is non-paid yeah and (72:28 - 72:32)
all they would have to do is switch that (72:31 - 72:34)
to paid (72:32 - 72:37)
and i'd probably do it i don't (72:34 - 72:40)
i if you're separating out your currency (72:37 - 72:40)
of (72:40 - 72:42)
paid and non-paid and i'm paying you (72:40 - 72:44)
money why are you giving me non-paid (72:42 - 72:47)
gems dna (72:44 - 72:50)
i don't i have no problem with drip (72:47 - 72:51)
feeding (72:50 - 72:53)
you know hey you're you're getting this (72:51 - 72:55)
many gems total but we're only giving (72:53 - 72:56)
you 50 a day that's (72:55 - 72:57)
fine because i'm going to log in every (72:56 - 72:59)
day anyways and if i'm paying for (72:57 - 73:01)
something to remind myself to log in (72:59 - 73:04)
that's fine but don't give me non-paid (73:01 - 73:04)
gems (73:04 - 73:06)
i'm paying you money for gems don't give (73:04 - 73:09)
me not paid so i i like the concept of (73:06 - 73:10)
the gem bundle (73:09 - 73:12)
i like the sync or boost i think that's (73:10 - 73:14)
awesome i like the skip tickets i like (73:12 - 73:17)
the the price is fine but (73:14 - 73:19)
that one line bothered me i did send (73:17 - 73:21)
them feedback about that if i'm paying (73:19 - 73:22)
for gems (73:21 - 73:24)
do not give me non-paid that's all i'm (73:22 - 73:26)
asking for (73:24 - 73:29)
but i would not be surprised and this is (73:26 - 73:31)
this was a rumor (73:29 - 73:33)
that the data miners for pokemon go (73:31 - 73:36)
found that there was a subscription (73:33 - 73:39)
uh hidden in pokemon go as of the last (73:36 - 73:40)
update (73:39 - 73:43)
which is not surprising there's a (73:40 - 73:44)
subscription for fire emblem (73:43 - 73:46)
heroes there's a subscription for animal (73:44 - 73:49)
crossing there's a subscription for (73:46 - 73:52)
mario kart i would not be surprised (73:49 - 73:55)
i i again i i know i'm partnered with (73:52 - 73:57)
dna i have no inside knowledge i would (73:55 - 73:58)
not be surprised if (73:57 - 74:00)
this is if there would be a subscription (73:58 - 74:01)
to masters (74:00 - 74:03)
slash would be a subscription to pokemon (74:01 - 74:05)
go (74:03 - 74:08)
just a breaking news flash (74:05 - 74:10)
i decided to use my three thousand on (74:08 - 74:12)
the ten poll on the blue banner (74:10 - 74:14)
uh-huh did you get four blues in a (74:12 - 74:16)
single pole incredible greg i'm so happy (74:14 - 74:17)
for you (74:16 - 74:21)
no but i just get two you got something (74:17 - 74:24)
whoa that's sweet (74:21 - 74:24)
now you guys need to evaluate your life (74:24 - 74:30)
choices you're the one playing gardens (74:27 - 74:33)
i am actually knitting right now and (74:30 - 74:34)
doing (74:33 - 74:38)
something worthwhile with my time (74:34 - 74:38)
i two two in the same poll that's all so (74:39 - 74:46)
i'm feeling i take back a little bit (74:44 - 74:47)
what i said okay (74:46 - 74:51)
perfect it's it's almost like (74:47 - 74:54)
rng gives and rng takes ah (74:51 - 74:56)
ever since the eggs been have been (74:54 - 74:58)
introduced in masters i've had (74:56 - 75:02)
tons of people through slack or through (74:58 - 75:04)
twitch streams say that they got back (75:02 - 75:05)
into masters because of eggs (75:04 - 75:10)
and they specifically just like the eggs (75:05 - 75:13)
i i am so tired of eggs (75:10 - 75:14)
really like i don't know i don't know (75:13 - 75:16)
what to do with all these pokemon other (75:14 - 75:17)
than just turn them in because (75:16 - 75:19)
yeah never going to sink you can you can (75:17 - 75:20)
filter by (75:19 - 75:23)
um one and two and i just throw away all (75:20 - 75:24)
the one and twos (75:23 - 75:26)
and then yeah i've been doing that too (75:24 - 75:27)
but i'm like (75:26 - 75:29)
okay so now i have a bunch of different (75:27 - 75:31)
threes i have i'm never gonna power them (75:29 - 75:31)
up (75:31 - 75:34)
because i've heard there's only that (75:31 - 75:35)
nidoqueen nidoking might be really (75:34 - 75:36)
really good with (75:35 - 75:42)
um leaf because of her poison stuff (75:36 - 75:42)
and apparently janine has gotten really (75:43 - 75:46)
good because (75:45 - 75:49)
she has poison stuff too and there (75:46 - 75:51)
wasn't a really good poison setter until (75:49 - 75:51)
leaf (75:51 - 75:54)
arrived last week or yeah venom trench (75:51 - 75:56)
oh the venom drenched wouldn't it be (75:54 - 75:58)
better with koga though (75:56 - 76:00)
uh maybe yeah poisoned with i don't know (75:58 - 76:02)
because venom drenched too (76:00 - 76:07)
and coke is a lot faster um hmm (76:02 - 76:09)
so when does the fam so family story (76:07 - 76:10)
family time story event begins nine (76:09 - 76:13)
nine so not next week but the week after (76:10 - 76:15)
which seems appropriate i believe the (76:13 - 76:17)
egg stuff the charmander bulbasaur (76:15 - 76:20)
squirtle stuff i believe that starts (76:17 - 76:22)
on the third which right now is we get (76:20 - 76:25)
the normal eggs which i think the only (76:22 - 76:27)
i think the only one that can be shiny (76:25 - 76:29)
is tauros (76:27 - 76:32)
yep which i have not pulled (76:29 - 76:35)
they did put out a little uh trailer or (76:32 - 76:36)
whatever of like celebrating the one (76:35 - 76:37)
year (76:36 - 76:39)
and the thing i found the most (76:37 - 76:40)
interesting is (76:39 - 76:42)
at one point in masters you could have (76:40 - 76:43)
picked (76:42 - 76:46)
which egg you want so like professor (76:43 - 76:47)
bellis is that her name (76:46 - 76:49)
yeah she was like do you want charmander (76:47 - 76:50)
squirtle or bubble sore (76:49 - 76:53)
classic you know the classic only you (76:50 - 76:54)
know that classic oh gee (76:53 - 76:58)
fans will remember uh and (76:54 - 76:59)
i think master i i don't have the (76:58 - 77:01)
numbers in front of me but i'm pretty (76:59 - 77:02)
sure it was eight million people picked (77:01 - 77:03)
squirtle (77:02 - 77:05)
eight million people picked bulbasaur (77:03 - 77:09)
and 18 million people picked charmander (77:05 - 77:12)
and you you you wonder why they pushed (77:09 - 77:15)
charizard so (77:12 - 77:15)
hard (77:15 - 77:19)
that's a lot of that's a big difference (77:16 - 77:21)
which is funny because at the time red (77:19 - 77:22)
was already in the game you could have (77:21 - 77:24)
already had red and charizard in the (77:22 - 77:25)
game (77:24 - 77:28)
maybe people felt like oh i can't pull (77:25 - 77:30)
red so i'll pick the charmander (77:28 - 77:32)
well but you couldn't get a charmander (77:30 - 77:33)
yeah that's the thing (77:32 - 77:36)
yeah it's true i guess uh but charmander (77:33 - 77:38)
squirtle bulbasaur will be appearing in (77:36 - 77:41)
eggs and i believe on the third so (77:38 - 77:44)
that's happening um there's a lot (77:41 - 77:45)
happening in masters right now so (77:44 - 77:47)
if you haven't played it if you're (77:45 - 77:49)
curious you get the 3 000 bonus when you (77:47 - 77:51)
log in (77:49 - 77:53)
and then you get the daily gem bonus (77:51 - 77:55)
when you load perfect game (77:53 - 77:58)
it's still fun are frustrating things as (77:55 - 78:00)
there are in all gadget games but yeah (77:58 - 78:01)
give it a shot (78:00 - 78:03)
see what you think now now's probably a (78:01 - 78:06)
very good time to jump in (78:03 - 78:09)
yeah they're being generous because it's (78:06 - 78:10)
the one year (78:09 - 78:13)
all right there was uh some other stuff (78:10 - 78:14)
that we (78:13 - 78:15)
could talk about but we've gone real (78:14 - 78:18)
long so (78:15 - 78:18)
we'll save it for next week i don't (78:19 - 78:22)
think there's any more anniversary slash (78:20 - 78:24)
pogo like i don't think (78:22 - 78:26)
unless niantic was gonna completely (78:24 - 78:28)
rework the mega evolution in a week (78:26 - 78:28)
which i (78:28 - 78:30)
don't think so uh i think i think we're (78:28 - 78:32)
in the clear (78:30 - 78:35)
will pokemon of the week all right so (78:32 - 78:37)
last week's pokemon of the week i was (78:35 - 78:38)
going real (78:37 - 78:41)
easy on everybody because coming up (78:38 - 78:44)
we're going extra hard i'm tired of the (78:41 - 78:46)
complaints and the (78:44 - 78:50)
the soft all you softies out there so (78:46 - 78:53)
get ready but last week's it wasn't a (78:50 - 78:54)
pokemon (78:53 - 78:56)
had something to do with mountain biking (78:54 - 78:58)
which is very expensive (78:56 - 79:00)
and going around hoenn and you had an (78:58 - 79:02)
option of two bikes and it's not the (79:00 - 79:04)
mock bike (79:02 - 79:09)
so therefore it's (79:04 - 79:13)
quick claw yes (79:09 - 79:17)
it's the aggro bike acro bike thank you (79:13 - 79:19)
or the one wheel you know this should (79:17 - 79:20)
bring that one wheel thing into (79:19 - 79:23)
the next gen 9. yeah well they probably (79:20 - 79:24)
will wrote on one wheel (79:23 - 79:26)
wasn't there a rumor that skateboards (79:24 - 79:27)
were being added wasn't that like a (79:26 - 79:29)
thing for gen seven (79:27 - 79:31)
yeah probably at all it wasn't a good (79:29 - 79:32)
one (79:31 - 79:34)
wow it wasn't a good rumor it was just a (79:32 - 79:35)
remember there's (79:34 - 79:38)
no shiny acro bike i think there was (79:35 - 79:40)
once an acrobatic tcg card that like (79:38 - 79:41)
lets you look at two cards from the top (79:40 - 79:43)
of your deck or something weird like (79:41 - 79:45)
that but (79:43 - 79:48)
there you go there's no trivia except (79:45 - 79:50)
except it bounces well i mean mountain (79:48 - 79:52)
bikes bounce as well if you know what (79:50 - 79:53)
you're doing (79:52 - 79:56)
all right you are wounded (79:53 - 80:00)
from your front set activities uh (79:56 - 80:02)
hey i went mountain biking for an hour (80:00 - 80:04)
yesterday and did not fall once (80:02 - 80:07)
and went on the more difficult course so (80:04 - 80:08)
i'm getting better (80:07 - 80:12)
good job all right so we're going harder (80:08 - 80:16)
this week next week uh i believe at one (80:12 - 80:18)
point i threatened that it would just be (80:16 - 80:19)
one letter of the alphabet (80:18 - 80:22)
and not an unknown we're we're about (80:19 - 80:24)
there folks uh we didn't do trivia for (80:22 - 80:26)
the bike (80:24 - 80:28)
is there trivia yes in generation four (80:26 - 80:30)
at rad's rickshaws (80:28 - 80:32)
cycle shop there's an advertisement on (80:30 - 80:34)
the shelves for mock bikes (80:32 - 80:37)
and acura bikes oh that's right in omega (80:34 - 80:40)
ruby alpha sapphire the bells (80:37 - 80:43)
on different bikes have different sounds (80:40 - 80:44)
they do because omega ruby apple (80:43 - 80:45)
software is one of the greatest games (80:44 - 80:46)
ever made and (80:45 - 80:49)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee the bike (80:46 - 80:50)
maniac (80:49 - 80:53)
in cerulean city has some acro bikes on (80:50 - 80:54)
display (80:53 - 80:56)
in his home well there you go that's (80:54 - 80:58)
more trivia than a lot of (80:56 - 81:03)
that's very true i'm impressed (80:58 - 81:03)
all right are you guys ready for this (81:04 - 81:06)
week's pokemon no because there's going (81:05 - 81:08)
to be like one letter and i'll have no (81:06 - 81:09)
idea (81:08 - 81:11)
that's like it that's in one or two (81:09 - 81:12)
weeks from now we're going to be getting (81:11 - 81:15)
harder and harder mega (81:12 - 81:15)
all right this week's pokemon american (81:18 - 81:23)
english-speaking fans (81:22 - 81:26)
of the australian band king gizzard and (81:23 - 81:27)
the lizard wizard (81:26 - 81:28)
will instantly recognize this week's (81:27 - 81:30)
pokemon in the name of the fourth (81:28 - 81:32)
song on their only album that was (81:30 - 81:35)
released in 2016. (81:32 - 81:37)
this is the infinite loop album that can (81:35 - 81:40)
be played over and over again non-stop (81:37 - 81:42)
as a continuous flow i say the only (81:40 - 81:44)
album released in 2016 (81:42 - 81:46)
because they released five albums in (81:44 - 81:48)
2017 (81:46 - 81:51)
no new material in 2018 and two albums (81:48 - 81:53)
in 2019 (81:51 - 81:56)
i must clarify that in a vernacular (81:53 - 81:56)
sense (81:56 - 81:58)
the bird mentioned in the song title is (81:56 - 82:00)
not actually in the name of this week's (81:58 - 82:02)
pokemon (82:00 - 82:04)
it appears that in north america we (82:02 - 82:06)
interchangeably refer to a particular (82:04 - 82:08)
carrion loving bird by two different (82:06 - 82:09)
names (82:08 - 82:11)
in the rest of the world including (82:09 - 82:13)
australia the bird referenced in this (82:11 - 82:15)
week's pokemon's name is sometimes used (82:13 - 82:17)
interchangeably (82:15 - 82:20)
when referring to walks i can reliably (82:17 - 82:20)
say (82:20 - 82:22)
that north americans do not view walks (82:20 - 82:23)
to be anything (82:22 - 82:26)
close to the bird referred to in this (82:23 - 82:28)
week's pokemon and game freak must agree (82:26 - 82:31)
as the art for this pokemon does not (82:28 - 82:33)
resemble a huak in any way (82:31 - 82:35)
adding to the confusion is some (82:33 - 82:37)
additional intellectual and linguistic (82:35 - 82:38)
ambiguity (82:37 - 82:40)
the first part of this week's pokemon's (82:38 - 82:42)
name refers to an organ that (82:40 - 82:44)
in mammals and fishies is considered to (82:42 - 82:46)
hold the teeth (82:44 - 82:49)
historically in this universe birds do (82:46 - 82:50)
not have teeth (82:49 - 82:52)
but it appears that the upper and lower (82:50 - 82:54)
portions of the beaks (82:52 - 82:56)
are referred to using the same word we (82:54 - 82:57)
would use (82:56 - 83:00)
for the teeth-holding organ all right (82:57 - 83:02)
that's all you get (83:00 - 83:02)
oh it's so easy (83:05 - 83:08)
i had to listen to that again i'll post (83:08 - 83:13)
it in the slack (83:12 - 83:16)
please do so there's okay quick question (83:13 - 83:17)
about (83:16 - 83:19)
is this a cd still that you can list on (83:17 - 83:20)
the infinite loop (83:19 - 83:23)
did they release it digitally uh just (83:20 - 83:24)
does it (83:23 - 83:26)
work diligently the way that well yeah (83:24 - 83:28)
because if you're in itunes and you can (83:26 - 83:30)
you can put an album on repeat album (83:28 - 83:32)
right but it's just basically if (83:30 - 83:34)
if you play it start to finish once it (83:32 - 83:35)
finishes (83:34 - 83:37)
you can go to the first song and it'll (83:35 - 83:39)
flow right into the first song (83:37 - 83:42)
dang that's a lot of work (83:39 - 83:42)
it is i forgot to say the blue (83:43 - 83:49)
red and leaf event run until like (83:46 - 83:51)
september 30th (83:49 - 83:54)
a lot of time on that so don't feel like (83:51 - 83:55)
you have to spend (83:54 - 83:58)
79.99 right away (83:55 - 84:00)
even though i might that's alright (83:58 - 84:01)
you're such a sucker (84:00 - 84:03)
i look i'm having a good time with (84:01 - 84:05)
masters greg don't (84:03 - 84:07)
judge me just because i will judge you (84:05 - 84:09)
because you're still a sucker my polls (84:07 - 84:10)
are better than your polls although i (84:09 - 84:11)
don't know if i'm gonna beat that two (84:10 - 84:12)
blue that two blues (84:11 - 84:16)
yeah that's good retire now i'm done i'm (84:12 - 84:18)
out i'm out of the game (84:16 - 84:20)
i sent i took my proof i sent it to the (84:18 - 84:22)
only person who could possibly care (84:20 - 84:23)
about it (84:22 - 84:25)
and then i'm out kickstarter ended thank (84:23 - 84:26)
you everyone (84:25 - 84:29)
uh who did the kickstarter i think like (84:26 - 84:32)
188 people (84:29 - 84:36)
uh did it awesome thank you i have never (84:32 - 84:40)
spent so much money to hear myself (84:36 - 84:40)
somebody true that is a true sentence (84:41 - 84:48)
this episode will come out on the 31st (84:45 - 84:49)
of september (84:48 - 84:51)
sorry this episode will come out of the (84:49 - 84:54)
31st of (84:51 - 84:54)
august september (84:57 - 85:01)
1st is a good time to sign up for the (84:59 - 85:03)
patreon if you (85:01 - 85:06)
were considering it and um (85:03 - 85:08)
starting september 1st which is tuesday (85:06 - 85:10)
by the way there are now (85:08 - 85:14)
uh yearly plans on patreon so (85:10 - 85:17)
if you wanted to sign up for the slack (85:14 - 85:18)
which is two dollars a month (85:17 - 85:21)
you get a 10 discount if you do a whole (85:18 - 85:22)
year (85:21 - 85:23)
and then you don't have to worry about (85:22 - 85:24)
it your credit card getting charged (85:23 - 85:25)
every (85:24 - 85:28)
every month for two bucks you save a (85:25 - 85:29)
little bit of money (85:28 - 85:31)
you can do that for pretty much any tier (85:29 - 85:32)
so it just locks it in (85:31 - 85:34)
i know that there's a lot of this is (85:32 - 85:36)
like an ongoing thing where patreon is (85:34 - 85:38)
really weird with payment processors so (85:36 - 85:40)
like five people every month are like oh (85:38 - 85:41)
my credit card didn't get charged (85:40 - 85:43)
because patreon thought it was (85:41 - 85:44)
i don't know i don't know why this (85:43 - 85:47)
happens but makes it really easy (85:44 - 85:49)
you do get a discount if you want to (85:47 - 85:50)
support for (85:49 - 85:53)
you know a period of time so that (85:50 - 85:55)
is and and the beginning of the month is (85:53 - 85:57)
always the best time to sign up so (85:55 - 85:59)
