busy busy weekend of board games with (3:37 - 3:43)

with all these people in their (3:45 - 3:49)
engagements and Bachelor parties and (3:47 - 3:53)
marri stop they should stop getting (3:49 - 3:56)
married marriage is such a like 18th (3:53 - 4:00)
century out ofd waste of time 18th (3:56 - 4:04)
century e yes all right you I&#39;m not (4:00 - 4:07)
going to I TR was what what board games (4:04 - 4:09)
did you play was there a good one um so (4:07 - 4:12)
uh all I mean my family has taste please (4:09 - 4:16)
um we played uh so today we played Machi (4:12 - 4:19)
Koro which is a good I love Machi Coro (4:16 - 4:21)
yeah well I don&#39;t even know what what (4:19 - 4:23)
genre would you call that like I would (4:21 - 4:26)
say h it&#39;s pretty a it&#39;s a pretty high (4:23 - 4:29)
luck game hm yeah it is that&#39;s the one (4:26 - 4:30)
where you collect the sushi Chee and (4:29 - 4:31)
then if you get the piece of cake you (4:30 - 4:35)
win right no that&#39;s uh sush bikoro is (4:31 - 4:37)
like you&#39;re you&#39;re building a little (4:35 - 4:40)
city and you roll the dice and it um (4:37 - 4:42)
will activate those buildings that you (4:40 - 4:44)
bought in the city to give you money um (4:42 - 4:47)
and then we played Millennium blades (4:44 - 4:48)
which is pretty funny and and pretty (4:47 - 4:50)
good I don&#39;t know if you played that one (4:48 - 4:52)
Steve no I&#39;ve never heard of that what (4:50 - 4:56)
is that it&#39;s uh how do I even so it&#39;s (4:52 - 5:00)
like a trading card game simulator (4:56 - 5:04)
so half of half of the game is playing a (5:00 - 5:06)
trading card game in a tournament and (5:04 - 5:09)
the other half of the game is buying (5:06 - 5:12)
packs and trading with other players but (5:09 - 5:14)
it&#39;s all like contained there actually (5:12 - 5:16)
isn&#39;t a trading card game it&#39;s it&#39;s all (5:14 - 5:19)
in one box and so like you play the the (5:16 - 5:21)
tournament with a fairly simple trading (5:19 - 5:24)
card game and then you earn like money (5:21 - 5:26)
from doing that which then you can you (5:24 - 5:28)
earn points from doing that and then you (5:26 - 5:30)
can earn more points by like Gathering a (5:28 - 5:33)
collection and and buying cards and (5:30 - 5:35)
stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s and the aesthetic of it (5:33 - 5:38)
is plays on the sort of busy aesthetic (5:35 - 5:40)
that a lot of card games have especially (5:38 - 5:43)
like uh Yu-Gi-Oh so it has like all of (5:40 - 5:45)
these like very vibrant color like too (5:43 - 5:47)
many colors and too many things going on (5:45 - 5:48)
but it&#39;s on purpose because it&#39;s sort of (5:47 - 5:51)
making fun of that sort of thing but (5:48 - 5:53)
it&#39;s it&#39;s quite fun I enjoyed it it&#39;s (5:51 - 5:55)
difficult to describe but if you look it (5:53 - 5:57)
up you&#39;ll understand it what was that (5:55 - 5:59)
one more time for the name Millennium (5:57 - 6:03)
blade bles okay cool well my week has (5:59 - 6:06)
been consisted of a little bit of (6:03 - 6:09)
Monster Hunter generations and I played (6:06 - 6:10)
a little bit with will last night and (6:09 - 6:14)
played with okay how is like 4 hours (6:10 - 6:17)
straight playing a little bit I mean if (6:14 - 6:19)
you take four hours out of your entire (6:17 - 6:22)
week that is a little bit oh fine fine (6:19 - 6:25)
fine fine I think though I played a (6:22 - 6:27)
little bit before that too I probably (6:25 - 6:29)
put in like eight hours this week this (6:27 - 6:31)
past week so I played with a bunch of (6:29 - 6:33)
people in slack and played with Will (6:31 - 6:36)
played with Logan and and other people (6:33 - 6:39)
I&#39;m forgetting their names but uh it was (6:36 - 6:42)
great if uh we have about 30 or so (6:39 - 6:44)
people out of our 200 people in the (6:42 - 6:46)
Monster Hunter Channel and our slack so (6:44 - 6:49)
if you&#39;re wanting to play Monster Hunter (6:46 - 6:50)
if you&#39;ve never played it before I feel (6:49 - 6:52)
like monster hunter is H maybe we said (6:50 - 6:54)
this last week monster hunter the (6:52 - 6:57)
Monster Hunter player base is the most (6:54 - 6:59)
open player base to teaching other (6:57 - 7:01)
people how to play Monster Hunter and I (6:59 - 7:03)
definitely feel that like I definitely (7:01 - 7:05)
don&#39;t mind hunting lower level monsters (7:03 - 7:07)
to help people learn and play Monster (7:05 - 7:09)
Hunter so that&#39;s something you&#39;re into (7:07 - 7:11)
our slack Community has a great Monster (7:09 - 7:13)
Hunter group that seems to be active (7:11 - 7:16)
pretty pretty much every day I see (7:13 - 7:18)
people willing to hunt or wanting to (7:16 - 7:20)
hunt the other thing I&#39;ve been working (7:18 - 7:24)
on is a Rebrand of Pokemon podcast and (7:20 - 7:27)
it&#39;s super effective it is this would be (7:24 - 7:29)
technically our sixth year anniversary (7:27 - 7:31)
episode probably put some like people (7:29 - 7:33)
cheering in the background or something (7:31 - 7:36)
here are you sure I am sure that this is (7:33 - 7:40)
year six what what was the birth date of (7:36 - 7:44)
it super effective first episode yeah (7:40 - 7:46)
when when did you record it back in that (7:44 - 7:51)
dark basement full of mold it was 2010 I (7:46 - 7:53)
know that I know that for sure it was (7:51 - 7:56)
probably July 26 but probably didn&#39;t hit (7:53 - 8:00)
iTunes until the 28th if if I was to get (7:56 - 8:02)
that right and the website which was (8:00 - 8:04)
being made prior probably didn&#39;t go up (8:02 - 8:07)
until about August 1st so like the day (8:04 - 8:09)
before your birthday no my birthday was (8:07 - 8:12)
two days ago your birthday was the 29th (8:09 - 8:15)
yeah yeah you just said it went on the (8:12 - 8:16)
the (8:15 - 8:18)
internet you&#39;re just so disagreeable (8:16 - 8:20)
today I guess that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to (8:18 - 8:22)
have to deal with all right all right (8:20 - 8:24)
I&#39;m picking up what you&#39;re putting down (8:22 - 8:26)
I I mean there&#39;s no I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a (8:24 - 8:28)
specific date when that episode was (8:26 - 8:30)
published but to me (8:28 - 8:33)
I didn&#39;t start like at you would have (8:30 - 8:36)
had to specifically known that it was (8:33 - 8:39)
created and in iTunes on that date where (8:36 - 8:42)
I didn&#39;t really like announce it until (8:39 - 8:44)
the website was up which was I think the (8:42 - 8:47)
for it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s sort of like (8:44 - 8:51)
how no one knows for sure when Jesus of (8:47 - 8:53)
Nazareth was born so we just say that&#39;s (8:51 - 8:56)
December 25th because it&#39;s it&#39;s it it it (8:53 - 8:59)
was lost to time um but it&#39;s an (8:56 - 9:01)
important enough I would say that it&#39;s (8:59 - 9:03)
an important enough event to have (9:01 - 9:05)
something on par with (9:03 - 9:09)
Christmas yes yes so everyone exchange (9:05 - 9:10)
gifts (9:09 - 9:14)

this podcast uh so yeah I&#39;ve been (9:16 - 9:23)
working on rebranding redesigning the (9:19 - 9:26)
logos the type slightly the website like (9:23 - 9:28)
the website structure will same stay the (9:26 - 9:31)
same but the graphics will be updated uh (9:28 - 9:34)
a little bit of color adjustment so this (9:31 - 9:38)
was this was just me being not satisfied (9:34 - 9:41)
with the the typography that I used (9:38 - 9:44)
for the podcast art and everything and (9:41 - 9:47)
like I&#39;ve always enjoyed the Pokeball (9:44 - 9:49)
logo that I originally designed but when (9:47 - 9:51)
I went down this Rabbit Hole of like (9:49 - 9:54)
looking for fonts and and getting that (9:51 - 9:58)
to work in a way that I enjoyed stuff (9:54 - 10:00)
got changed so by the time that episode (9:58 - 10:03)

Minaj bages meme there&#39;s a Nicki Minaj (15:39 - 15:46)

you know like the O really Meme and you (16:22 - 16:26)
know like the what are some other ones (16:24 - 16:28)
that start well a lot of the old meme (16:26 - 16:31)
like very old memes in the would you say (16:28 - 16:34)
will L late &#39;90s early 2000s or was it (16:31 - 16:37)
just early 2000s that was YTM andd uh no (16:34 - 16:39)
I was in my current office building and (16:37 - 16:42)
we moved there there in 2006 when the oh (16:39 - 16:44)
okay so not not as early as I&#39;m thinking (16:42 - 16:45)
yeah no cuz there I know there was a (16:44 - 16:49)
Harry Potter uh Snape meme that was on (16:45 - 16:51)
YTM andd but around that era there was a (16:49 - 16:55)
website called ytmnd.com (16:51 - 16:59)
where you would upload an image a sound (16:55 - 17:01)
file and write some text and it would (16:59 - 17:05)
generate a website at whatever you named (17:01 - 17:08)
it. ytmnd.com where it would play that (17:05 - 17:12)
audio on a loop have that image or or (17:08 - 17:15)
GIF like animated gif and then put the (17:12 - 17:18)
text over it in like all caps Times New (17:15 - 17:20)
Roman in a way that looked like it was (17:18 - 17:22)
like flying at you and you would just (17:20 - 17:24)
like make jokes with it I guess yeah it (17:22 - 17:27)
was very much um if to put things in (17:24 - 17:31)
modern terms like a love child between I (17:27 - 17:34)
funny and Vine because it would just (17:31 - 17:37)
repeat the same very brief animated gif (17:34 - 17:39)
over and over and over and over again of (17:37 - 17:41)
a meme I see how wait how do we get here (17:39 - 17:44)
because Travis was active on the site (17:41 - 17:46)
because Travis is I mean that&#39;s yeah (17:44 - 17:48)
that&#39;s that&#39;s proof that I that&#39;s my (17:46 - 17:51)
meme cred that I was on YTM andd in the (17:48 - 17:53)
I see all right mid 2000s he was pumping (17:51 - 17:57)
out those tasty tasty memes understand I (17:53 - 18:01)
I mostly did Do&#39;s with DW which was the (17:57 - 18:02)
term for actually what we were just (18:01 - 18:04)
talking about it sort of like a Manda (18:02 - 18:07)
green of a misher lyric with uh Nicki (18:04 - 18:10)
minage and bages because I I would do (18:07 - 18:12)
things where that was one of the common (18:10 - 18:14)
ones you people would do is you would (18:12 - 18:16)
take a song and then you would (18:14 - 18:18)
deliberately mishear the lyric and then (18:16 - 18:20)
put an image of the misheard lyric and (18:18 - 18:23)
that would be the joke like things were (18:20 - 18:25)
very sophisticated back in the day like (18:23 - 18:27)
like that squeeze song pulling muscles (18:25 - 18:30)
for Michelle we&#39;re going we&#39;re too off (18:27 - 18:32)
topic now I just took it all back to the (18:30 - 18:36)
80s all right yeah let&#39;s talk about the (18:32 - 18:40)
2016 and when I mean the (18:36 - 18:45)
2016sam goes yesterday July 30th was the (18:40 - 18:48)
first major update to Pokémon go I&#39;m (18:45 - 18:50)
going to read what this update has done (18:48 - 18:52)
and then we&#39;re going to talk about that (18:50 - 18:54)
a little bit there were some people (18:52 - 18:56)
upset about this update and we can talk (18:54 - 18:58)
about that too uh I&#39;ll start off saying (18:56 - 19:00)
that I&#39;m not said it all about this (18:58 - 19:02)
update I actually think that it&#39;s good (19:00 - 19:05)
and we&#39;ll get to that all right so this (19:02 - 19:08)
update uh the first change is avatars (19:05 - 19:09)
there is an option to customize your (19:08 - 19:11)
trainer after creation Now They added (19:09 - 19:12)
more (19:11 - 19:16)
clothing uh for the male trainer it was (19:12 - 19:20)
at least two new hats shirts pants shoes (19:16 - 19:22)
backpacks that I saw I didn&#39;t check the (19:20 - 19:24)
female trainer I did click the female (19:22 - 19:25)
button and then I lost all the save (19:24 - 19:28)
settings on my mail trainer and so I (19:25 - 19:29)
just went back and recreated in my mail (19:28 - 19:32)
trainer again no it does that the next (19:29 - 19:35)
one is battling got changed from my (19:32 - 19:37)
understanding and I&#39;m reading this (19:35 - 19:40)
article off Reddit who break they break (19:37 - 19:42)
down what exactly the changes does (19:40 - 19:44)
besides saying like Avatar changes (19:42 - 19:46)
damages per second DPS has been revamped (19:44 - 19:48)
for nearly every move in the game (19:46 - 19:51)
bringing balance to this Force this (19:48 - 19:53)
combat uh as they state is immensely (19:51 - 19:56)
more fun and please see this section for (19:53 - 19:59)
updated DPS so battling is different I (19:56 - 20:01)
have not went outside my house since (19:59 - 20:04)
this update so I&#39;m not sure uh Nest ja (20:01 - 20:07)
up majority of the nests around the (20:04 - 20:09)
world are spawning different species (20:07 - 20:11)
it&#39;s great to see species varieties like (20:09 - 20:12)
this though it appears that certain (20:11 - 20:16)
species they have Dratini uh have been (20:12 - 20:18)
made sign significantly more difficult (20:16 - 20:21)
to acquire now so again I think that&#39;s (20:18 - 20:24)
another good change I am seeing uh seal (20:21 - 20:26)
outside my house that is something I (20:24 - 20:28)
have not seen for the first 3 weeks of (20:26 - 20:30)
playing the game game so it looks like (20:28 - 20:32)
there is a seal Nest near me I think we (20:30 - 20:35)
talked about this before about the nest (20:32 - 20:38)
po Pokemon will respawn in certain areas (20:35 - 20:41)
that they are known for so a week or two (20:38 - 20:43)
ago when I was talking about going down (20:41 - 20:45)
to Lake Park in the Bradford Beach area (20:43 - 20:48)
in Milwaukee there was an onx Nest where (20:45 - 20:50)
they would spawn Always by the beach and (20:48 - 20:52)
they would spawn like once every hour (20:50 - 20:55)
and that this applies to all Pokémon in (20:52 - 20:56)
specific areas now they might spawn (20:55 - 20:58)
maybe once every 24 hours or once every (20:56 - 21:01)
5 hours that is kind of you know up in (20:58 - 21:04)
the air but I&#39;m assuming that that Nest (21:01 - 21:06)
area for Onyx which was one of the only (21:04 - 21:09)
places to get onx in the Milwaukee area (21:06 - 21:11)
that is probably different now so that (21:09 - 21:13)
is cool especially for people who live (21:11 - 21:14)
out in the middle of nowhere hopefully (21:13 - 21:15)
they are seeing slightly different (21:14 - 21:18)
Pokemon in their area that&#39;s I think (21:15 - 21:20)
exciting uh number four is the transfer (21:18 - 21:22)
button the button is no longer at the (21:20 - 21:24)
bottom of the Pokemon detail screens (21:22 - 21:26)
this will make transferring much more (21:24 - 21:28)
efficient uh you can also prevent (21:26 - 21:31)
transferring your you can also be (21:28 - 21:33)
prevented from accidentally transferring (21:31 - 21:35)
your favorite Pokemon so when you mark a (21:33 - 21:38)
Pokemon as favorite now you don&#39;t now (21:35 - 21:40)
you can&#39;t accidentally release it which (21:38 - 21:43)
is again another good change uh the (21:40 - 21:45)
other thing they mentioned is bug fixes (21:43 - 21:47)
that includes bugs with the maps the (21:45 - 21:50)
gyms encounters memory leaks they&#39;ve (21:47 - 21:53)
also removed all bug type Pokemon as a (21:50 - 21:56)
bug all right so avatars can be recustom (21:53 - 22:00)
recustom recustom (21:56 - 22:00)
recustom (22:00 - 22:03)
ized recomed Rec customized I&#39;m going to (22:03 - 22:10)
keep that I guess adjust battles move (22:07 - 22:13)
damage values for some Pokemon refin (22:10 - 22:15)
certain gym animations improved memory (22:13 - 22:17)
leaks removed Footprints of nearby (22:15 - 22:19)
Pokemon we&#39;ll get to that modified (22:17 - 22:23)
battle damage during mod modified battle (22:19 - 22:25)
damage calculation various bugs during (22:23 - 22:27)
wild Pokemon encounters I&#39;m assuming (22:25 - 22:29)
that&#39;s where the Pokeball gets stuck in (22:27 - 22:31)
midair updates to the Pokemon detail (22:29 - 22:34)
screen updated to the achievement metal (22:31 - 22:37)
images fixed an issue displaying certain (22:34 - 22:40)
map features minor text fixes all right (22:37 - 22:41)
so those are all the updates in the (22:40 - 22:44)
patch notes the big thing that are that (22:41 - 22:49)
is corrupted uh positivity of this game (22:44 - 22:53)
is the removal of the distance indicator (22:49 - 22:56)
the steps now I&#39;m sure will knows how (22:53 - 22:58)
this works I&#39;ll break it down for Travis (22:56 - 23:01)
there is a nearby feature in the bottom (22:58 - 23:03)
right hand corner of your screen when (23:01 - 23:06)
you tap that it brings up up to nine (23:03 - 23:09)
Pokemon that are in the area and if you (23:06 - 23:11)
have never seen that Pokemon it is a (23:09 - 23:13)
silhouette of that Pokemon of the whole (23:11 - 23:15)
like who&#39;s that Pokemon and if you watch (23:13 - 23:17)
a TV show or you know anything about (23:15 - 23:19)
Pokemon you can pretty much identify (23:17 - 23:21)
which Pokemon that is maybe not voltor (23:19 - 23:24)
or electrode cuz a very similar but for (23:21 - 23:26)
the most part you can identify the (23:24 - 23:29)
silhouette now under the Silhouettes (23:26 - 23:31)
there was a little footprint and it it (23:29 - 23:34)
was either no feet one foot two foot or (23:31 - 23:37)
three feet and it meant if there was no (23:34 - 23:39)
feet that Pokemon would pop up within (23:37 - 23:41)
the minute any second it would pop up if (23:39 - 23:44)
there was one feet you&#39;d have to walk uh (23:41 - 23:48)
a little bit uh I wouldn&#39;t say a lot (23:44 - 23:51)
probably one or two city blocks and the (23:48 - 23:54)
two feet were probably more of like five (23:51 - 23:56)
to six city blocks and the three feet (23:54 - 23:57)
was ah you&#39;re probably going to be (23:56 - 24:00)
walking more than a mile but it showed (23:57 - 24:03)
you the general premise so if if you saw (24:00 - 24:06)
a silhouette of a Snorlax at three uh (24:03 - 24:08)
you could start walking in a direction (24:06 - 24:10)
and if it went down to two and then it (24:08 - 24:12)
went down to one you obviously knew you (24:10 - 24:14)
were walking the right direction if it (24:12 - 24:16)
disappeared you were probably walking in (24:14 - 24:17)
the opposite direction so that&#39;s how (24:16 - 24:20)
that whole system worked and for those (24:17 - 24:21)
listening that said like H well actually (24:20 - 24:24)
2 ft is more than 5 to 6 that was just a (24:21 - 24:27)
general explanation I&#39;m sure people have (24:24 - 24:29)
calculated the exact distance since I (24:27 - 24:31)
was just giving a general of how the (24:29 - 24:34)
feet worked so in other words cool it (24:31 - 24:37)
okay just chill for a minute there was (24:34 - 24:41)
an update about a week or two ago I (24:37 - 24:43)
can&#39;t remember exactly when it came out (24:41 - 24:46)
but what it did is when uh nean was (24:43 - 24:49)
releasing these to more countries and an (24:46 - 24:52)
update came all the steps became three (24:49 - 24:54)
steps and no matter what everything was (24:52 - 24:56)
three steps so people were a little (24:54 - 24:58)
upset that this what was called (24:56 - 25:01)
three-step glitch happened now if you (24:58 - 25:03)
listened to the episode last week Logan (25:01 - 25:05)
explained that it wasn&#39;t a glitch that (25:03 - 25:07)
they purposely turned it off to help (25:05 - 25:09)
with server load nothing of that was (25:07 - 25:11)
ever confirmed I don&#39;t know if it was (25:09 - 25:12)
turned off because of server load I (25:11 - 25:15)
don&#39;t know if it was just broken I don&#39;t (25:12 - 25:20)
know if it was Google Map data I don&#39;t (25:15 - 25:22)
know no one really knows why it was (25:20 - 25:24)
turned off or why it broke but because (25:22 - 25:28)
of this update they have removed steps (25:24 - 25:31)
all together the last we heard about the (25:28 - 25:33)
motivation for this this decision was (25:31 - 25:36)
due to safety concerns but again that (25:33 - 25:37)
was not confirmed that is just what (25:36 - 25:41)
Reddit has stated they did say though if (25:37 - 25:43)
the Pokemon appears on the map you (25:41 - 25:46)
spotted they now stay on the map for (25:43 - 25:50)
roughly 300 M an increased distance so (25:46 - 25:53)
again don&#39;t know but Reddit is very very (25:50 - 25:56)
upset about this or and and on Twitter (25:53 - 25:58)
and on Facebook checked Facebook this (25:56 - 26:00)
morning I saw a couple upset posts I (25:58 - 26:03)
checked Twitter last night upset post (26:00 - 26:07)
Reddit upset post this is still one of (26:03 - 26:09)
the top games in the iTunes app store in (26:07 - 26:11)
the Google Play app store still one of (26:09 - 26:14)
the top grossing games still you know (26:11 - 26:17)
more active users than Twitter more (26:14 - 26:19)
active users than Candy Crush than Clash (26:17 - 26:23)
of Clans so obviously the game is (26:19 - 26:25)
extremely popular they remov this (26:23 - 26:28)
feature which some people found crucial (26:25 - 26:30)
but at the same time hasn&#39;t worked for (26:28 - 26:32)
almost two weeks what are your thoughts (26:30 - 26:35)
will uh well first off I&#39;m amazed that (26:32 - 26:38)
Tumblr is so cool and calm about the (26:35 - 26:39)
whole thing they&#39;re usually the ones (26:38 - 26:41)
that go off the wire faster than anybody (26:39 - 26:44)
else tumblr&#39;s always like one week late (26:41 - 26:46)
oh all right (26:44 - 26:50)
I you know I don&#39;t never understood I (26:46 - 26:52)
think I&#39;m getting a better understanding (26:50 - 26:55)
of the ftiz of the (26:52 - 26:59)
footprint thing I never used it I the (26:55 - 27:01)
the way I play Pokémon go am like (26:59 - 27:04)
perfectly happy go-lucky I&#39;m walking (27:01 - 27:06)
along whichever Pokemon encounter I (27:04 - 27:09)
encounter those are the ones I get and (27:06 - 27:12)
that&#39;s fine but I guess there are people (27:09 - 27:15)
who are actually like using that to try (27:12 - 27:17)
to complete their Pokedex and like (27:15 - 27:20)
literally hunting down different Pokemon (27:17 - 27:22)
that they didn&#39;t have to try to get to (27:20 - 27:25)
them and everything so it does like (27:22 - 27:27)
fundamentally change the way that those (27:25 - 27:29)
people play the game because no longer (27:27 - 27:33)
for I mean yeah they can&#39;t do sort of a (27:29 - 27:36)
scientifically derived triangulation (27:33 - 27:38)
find the Pokemon specific that they&#39;re (27:36 - 27:41)
looking for they can only do like I was (27:38 - 27:43)
doing which was like walking around and (27:41 - 27:46)
whatever Pokemon happen to show up those (27:43 - 27:49)
are the ones I grabbed um I think (27:46 - 27:52)
overall if it&#39;s not too harmful to the (27:49 - 27:54)
game it&#39;s actually going to increase the (27:52 - 27:57)
game&#39;s longevity because it makes it (27:54 - 27:59)
more difficult for people to find rarer (27:57 - 28:03)
Pokemon and so it&#39;ll slow down the rate (27:59 - 28:06)
of Pokedex completion and then a slower (28:03 - 28:08)
you got to hit that sweet spot of the (28:06 - 28:10)
slowness of completing the Pokedex and (28:08 - 28:12)
maintaining interest in the game to get (28:10 - 28:14)
that like perfect amount of longevity of (28:12 - 28:17)
people playing the game I I&#39;m pretty (28:14 - 28:19)
sure that if you know how it lists nine (28:17 - 28:22)
Pokemon will yes the ones that were (28:19 - 28:23)
always closest to you were always in the (28:22 - 28:26)
first or second spot like if you saw a (28:23 - 28:29)
Snorlax in like the the fifth spot it (28:26 - 28:32)
usually meant that it was two or three (28:29 - 28:34)
Footprints away and it wouldn&#39;t pop up (28:32 - 28:36)
anyways and the closer you got to it the (28:34 - 28:38)
more would move up that list so I&#39;m (28:36 - 28:42)
pretty sure the list order is still (28:38 - 28:45)
telling you which ones are closest well (28:42 - 28:48)
probably I I never use that so I mean (28:45 - 28:50)
it&#39;s just I guess if you can&#39;t see the (28:48 - 28:53)
number of footsteps decreasing or maybe (28:50 - 28:55)
you now have no faith in whether the (28:53 - 28:57)
ordering of that list actually means (28:55 - 29:01)
anything I would be I I haven&#39;t I (28:57 - 29:03)
haven&#39;t played Pokémon go for more than (29:01 - 29:05)
a couple minutes a day just because I (29:03 - 29:08)
haven&#39;t gotten outside the house have (29:05 - 29:10)
just been so busy I mean I we we&#39;re both (29:08 - 29:13)
going to Gen Con will and myself and so (29:10 - 29:14)
I&#39;ll be playing a lot of Pokemon go (29:13 - 29:16)
there because that just involves a lot (29:14 - 29:19)
of walking and there&#39;s there&#39;s downtime (29:16 - 29:21)
between events it might be 10 or 15 (29:19 - 29:23)
minutes of down time but that&#39;s still (29:21 - 29:26)
enough to walk to another destination (29:23 - 29:28)
and just open your app and check if (29:26 - 29:29)
there&#39;s in the area so I&#39;m definitely (29:28 - 29:31)
going to be playing a lot this upcoming (29:29 - 29:35)
week Travis as an as an outsider would (29:31 - 29:39)
it upset you that this game originally (29:35 - 29:42)
said there&#39;s a Charmander in this area (29:39 - 29:45)
it&#39;s about two steps away to now there&#39;s (29:42 - 29:49)
just a Charmander in this area good luck (29:45 - 29:52)
I guess it would depend on does it give (29:49 - 29:55)
you a Direction no it did it ever give (29:52 - 29:58)
you a direction yes it did actually it (29:55 - 30:01)
did it no it did not tell you go this (29:58 - 30:03)
way that way the other way all it said (30:01 - 30:05)
was one footprint two footprint three (30:03 - 30:10)
footprint no if if you if if the bar was (30:05 - 30:12)
pulsing that means you were facing the (30:10 - 30:14)
right direction so if it said that (30:12 - 30:16)
Charmander was two Footprints away and (30:14 - 30:19)
you pulled him up as your main focus (30:16 - 30:20)
because on the list of nine Pokemon you (30:19 - 30:23)
can either ignore that list or just tap (30:20 - 30:24)
on one and if you tapped on one that (30:23 - 30:26)
would be the focused Pokemon that you (30:24 - 30:28)
would be looking for so then you would (30:26 - 30:33)
spin in a 360 Dee Direction and when the (30:28 - 30:36)
bar started puls pulsating that means (30:33 - 30:37)
you were facing the right direction to (30:36 - 30:41)
start walking what yes I didn&#39;t know (30:37 - 30:45)
that yes does it does it that away I&#39;m (30:41 - 30:48)
not sure if it does still do that then I (30:45 - 30:51)
then I don&#39;t think I would be as upset (30:48 - 30:53)
because well I mean first of all it (30:51 - 30:54)
sounds like and I mean I&#39;ve been talking (30:53 - 30:56)
to my brother this weekend because he (30:54 - 30:59)
hasn&#39;t played a Pokemon game since (30:56 - 31:02)
fourth gen and he&#39;s been playing Pokemon (30:59 - 31:03)
go so I&#39;ve sort of just been asking him (31:02 - 31:06)
about it um and he echoed a lot of the (31:03 - 31:07)
sen sentiments that other people have (31:06 - 31:10)
said which is that the game sort of just (31:07 - 31:12)
throws you into it and says figure out (31:10 - 31:14)
all the mechanics which can be good or (31:12 - 31:18)
bad um so if it if I had known about (31:14 - 31:20)
this thing you were just explaining and (31:18 - 31:22)
the fact that will has been playing it (31:20 - 31:23)
and didn&#39;t know that indicates to me (31:22 - 31:26)
that they don&#39;t do they don&#39;t really (31:23 - 31:29)
show that prominently so they never (31:26 - 31:31)
explain that ever if I had already known (31:29 - 31:33)
that I wouldn&#39;t be so mad about the step (31:31 - 31:37)
change because I would at least be like (31:33 - 31:39)
well I at least I know I&#39;m going in the (31:37 - 31:41)
right direction and it&#39;s only going at (31:39 - 31:44)
at maximum it&#39;s going to be this amount (31:41 - 31:47)
of time for me to get there um but if I (31:44 - 31:49)
didn&#39;t know about that I would probably (31:47 - 31:53)
be more upset because it&#39;s like well I (31:49 - 31:56)
guess I&#39;m going to have to walk a huge (31:53 - 31:59)
radius all around where I am until I (31:56 - 32:02)
find it with with sort of aimless with (31:59 - 32:05)
not even knowing where along that radius (32:02 - 32:07)
it would be so if I pull up the nearby (32:05 - 32:10)
list uh I see a Pokemon on my list in (32:07 - 32:14)
order here it&#39;s goldine red Pidgeotto (32:10 - 32:18)
Weedle Pidgey venonat Rattata and Weedle (32:14 - 32:20)
and I cannot I cannot select them (32:18 - 32:22)
anymore so I can&#39;t bring them into Focus (32:20 - 32:24)
to do the uh the (32:22 - 32:26)
pulsating uh nearby bar so that doesn&#39;t (32:24 - 32:29)
work anymore so that sounds frust in (32:26 - 32:32)
yeah I mean I I have all these Pokémon (32:29 - 32:33)
and they&#39;re not Pokemon that I really (32:32 - 32:35)
need and nothing has popped up yet I (32:33 - 32:37)
would assume goldine would be the one (32:35 - 32:38)
that pops up since it&#39;s first in the (32:37 - 32:40)
list so I&#39;ll just keep it open and see (32:38 - 32:42)
if that happens but the other the other (32:40 - 32:44)
news that kind of carried off this was (32:42 - 32:47)
there was a thirdparty app called poke (32:44 - 32:50)
Vision I&#39;m sure there are other third (32:47 - 32:53)
party apps that did this but uh it was (32:50 - 32:58)
real time location map for Pokémon go so (32:53 - 33:00)
you could pull this up and it would show (32:58 - 33:03)
you let&#39;s use the Onyx spawn uh it would (33:00 - 33:05)
show you that hey Onyx spawn here on the (33:03 - 33:08)
Google Map this is where its nest is and (33:05 - 33:10)
so obviously because all the nests got (33:08 - 33:12)
changed and they actually got changed a (33:10 - 33:15)
day or two earlier before the update (33:12 - 33:16)
most of that data could have gone (33:15 - 33:18)
useless because hey that onx spawn is (33:16 - 33:20)
now a different spawn right probably (33:18 - 33:21)
wouldn&#39;t be that hard to update it (33:20 - 33:23)
though just hey report which Pokemon is (33:21 - 33:26)
now there let&#39;s update the list uh they (33:23 - 33:28)
are officially closing down and business (33:26 - 33:30)
for 3 weeks might be a new record here (33:28 - 33:33)
uh they tweeted hey guys we wish we had (33:30 - 33:35)
some news for you at this moment we are (33:33 - 33:37)
respecting the antic and Nintendo&#39;s (33:35 - 33:39)
wishes we will keep you guys posted (33:37 - 33:42)
heart emoji was that it was 9 hours ago (33:39 - 33:45)
as of this recording so from my (33:42 - 33:47)
understanding mining data from Pokémon (33:45 - 33:49)
go and then providing it outside of (33:47 - 33:50)
Pokémon go is against their terms and (33:49 - 33:52)
conditions that seems about right I&#39;m (33:50 - 33:54)
sure that says it somewhere in their (33:52 - 33:57)
terms and conditions no one reads yeah I (33:54 - 34:01)
hm 642 th000 followers so again pretty (33:57 - 34:05)
big uh pretty big increase to have over (34:01 - 34:07)
a half million followers in like three (34:05 - 34:09)
weeks I don&#39;t know how long it took them (34:07 - 34:10)
to build this app I just went to their (34:09 - 34:12)
website poke vision.com it just says our (34:10 - 34:14)
services are currently (34:12 - 34:16)
unavailable they are also running I see (34:14 - 34:20)
at least three four ads on their website (34:16 - 34:21)
so they&#39;re probably making a ton of (34:20 - 34:24)
money off ads so the question could be (34:21 - 34:26)
are they getting did did they get a ceas (34:24 - 34:28)
and assist because they were mining data (34:26 - 34:30)
outside of Pokémon go or did they get (34:28 - 34:33)
AAS and assist because they were clearly (34:30 - 34:36)
making money off of Pokémon go with ads (34:33 - 34:38)
oh I see it could be either one I don&#39;t (34:36 - 34:40)
know what it is exactly I don&#39;t know I&#39;m (34:38 - 34:43)
maybe a listener will write in and say (34:40 - 34:45)
uh they also had a support us via PayPal (34:43 - 34:47)
button now I never used a third party (34:45 - 34:49)
app I knew there was a ton I knew there (34:47 - 34:51)
was a bunch of people that said oh why (34:49 - 34:53)
don&#39;t you just use this app to you know (34:51 - 34:56)
complete or fill out your Pokedex to me (34:53 - 34:59)
the enjoyment was just going to an area (34:56 - 35:00)
and walking around like one of the most (34:59 - 35:02)
exciting things to me was you know when (35:00 - 35:04)
somebody yelled that there was a hitmon (35:02 - 35:06)
Chan in the area and I was already (35:04 - 35:08)
walking in that direction I got there I (35:06 - 35:10)
caught the Hitmonchan I didn&#39;t expect a (35:08 - 35:14)
Hitmonchan it was exciting Hitmonchan a (35:10 - 35:18)
Pokemon today&#39;s today&#39;s episode is (35:14 - 35:20)
brought to you by (35:18 - 35:22)
Hitmonchan today&#39;s special word is (35:20 - 35:24)
Hitmonchan if you hear the secret word (35:22 - 35:26)
you have to scream real (35:24 - 35:29)
loud I the this question is for both of (35:26 - 35:33)
you and this is how I feel I feel I felt (35:29 - 35:37)
using a third party app to just find (35:33 - 35:40)
Pokemon kind of takes away the whole (35:37 - 35:43)
exploring aspect of it yeah Pokémon go (35:40 - 35:46)
is supposed to be an adventure you go (35:43 - 35:47)
out and you discover for yourself you (35:46 - 35:50)
don&#39;t scientifically use apps to tell (35:47 - 35:52)
you exactly where to go I mean if I had (35:50 - 35:55)
every Pokémon except for like Electabuzz (35:52 - 35:56)
and you know I&#39;ve been playing the game (35:55 - 35:58)
for several months and I couldn&#39;t find (35:56 - 36:00)
Electabuzz I would probably use an app (35:58 - 36:04)
and say okay where is Electabuzz right (36:00 - 36:05)
that I guess that would make sense in (36:04 - 36:08)
some capacity but yeah for that last one (36:05 - 36:11)
you need for Pokedex completion yes like (36:08 - 36:14)
where&#39;s the ditto it it doesn&#39;t up I (36:11 - 36:15)
mean again this is someone who hasn&#39;t (36:14 - 36:17)
played the game but it doesn&#39;t upset me (36:15 - 36:18)
that much the idea of it doesn&#39;t upset (36:17 - 36:21)
me that much because you&#39;re not forced (36:18 - 36:24)
to use it I mean there might be a sense (36:21 - 36:25)
in which the people who do use it have (36:24 - 36:27)
an advantage so they gobble up the (36:25 - 36:28)
Pokemon (36:27 - 36:31)
before the legitimate players get there (36:28 - 36:33)
but I don&#39;t imagine that would have a (36:31 - 36:35)
huge impact on the game and otherwise (36:33 - 36:37)
it&#39;s not like you have to do it I mean (36:35 - 36:39)
that&#39;s a good point I I guess I&#39;ve never (36:37 - 36:40)
felt like I was in a race with anyone (36:39 - 36:44)
for Pokemon go it&#39;s not like oh Travis (36:40 - 36:46)
you have 80 Pokemon I only have (36:44 - 36:49)
75 I never felt like that but there were (36:46 - 36:52)
people out there like that there is yeah (36:49 - 36:53)
and I I&#39;ve definitely felt that in other (36:52 - 36:57)
games uh a good example was like I felt (36:53 - 36:59)
when I started playing Animal Crossing (36:57 - 37:01)
on the 3DS and I saw other people (36:59 - 37:03)
tweeting and playing Animal Crossing I (37:01 - 37:06)
always felt like it was like oh they got (37:03 - 37:07)
they got a lighthouse oh they got a park (37:06 - 37:09)
bench like I always felt like I&#39;m not (37:07 - 37:11)
doing good enough to get that and at the (37:09 - 37:14)
end of the day it was it was Animal (37:11 - 37:18)
Crossing So Random and so different for (37:14 - 37:20)
everyone that you can&#39;t really race I (37:18 - 37:22)
would suppose an animal crossing and it (37:20 - 37:26)
it did ruin the enjoyment of the time I (37:22 - 37:29)
spent with it for the most part so I (37:26 - 37:31)
definitely have tried to take a step (37:29 - 37:35)
back in in gaming and look at it of what (37:31 - 37:37)
am I getting out of this how am I (37:35 - 37:38)
playing it how am I enjoying it instead (37:37 - 37:40)
of like I need to have more Pokemon than (37:38 - 37:43)
everyone else otherwise I&#39;ll won&#39;t feel (37:40 - 37:45)
Superior so the whole point of this (37:43 - 37:48)
conversation is for you to justify why (37:45 - 37:50)
you were mad at me and Monster Hunter (37:48 - 37:52)
because I had started on my tetsu Cobra (37:50 - 37:55)
Arbor before you got a chance to I was (37:52 - 37:58)
now I understand mhm oh sure sure you (37:55 - 38:01)
weren&#39;t I mean I did complete it before (37:58 - 38:04)
you notice how he had to say that Travis (38:01 - 38:07)
he just couldn&#39;t let it lie notice how (38:04 - 38:08)
he had to mention that I mean I zoned (38:07 - 38:10)
out you said something about Monster (38:08 - 38:12)
Hunter so I zoned out I&#39;m sorry word I (38:10 - 38:15)
think Pokemon go is still cool I don&#39;t (38:12 - 38:17)
think people need additional apps I (38:15 - 38:18)
think it&#39;s a simple enough app uh (38:17 - 38:21)
program to use and just enjoy and people (38:18 - 38:25)
need to chill relax you know use games (38:21 - 38:27)
for what they&#39;re supposed to be which is (38:25 - 38:29)
a diversion from the horrors and ter you (38:27 - 38:31)
know terrible things that we experience (38:29 - 38:33)
in our day-to-day world and just have (38:31 - 38:35)
enjoy them and not make them into (38:33 - 38:38)
additional Terrors and Horrors I saw a (38:35 - 38:40)
Twitter saw a tweet out there which (38:38 - 38:42)
upset me because I&#39;m really hoping it&#39;s (38:40 - 38:44)
not real that there are like towns that (38:42 - 38:47)
are asking that all Poké stops in the (38:44 - 38:51)
town get removed like how ridiculous is (38:47 - 38:54)
that there are places that are like (38:51 - 38:56)
small businesses and churches and things (38:54 - 38:59)
that are asking that they be removed (38:56 - 39:01)
that that are Poké stops that are that (38:59 - 39:03)
are like writing letters to the antic (39:01 - 39:05)
asking them to be like emails or (39:03 - 39:07)
whatever asking I don&#39;t understand you (39:05 - 39:09)
don&#39;t have to be that close to a Pok (39:07 - 39:12)
stop to activate it what what&#39;s the deal (39:09 - 39:14)
I mean there there is a church that I (39:12 - 39:15)
pass that the only way to activate it is (39:14 - 39:18)
to drive into their parking lot and that (39:15 - 39:20)
is probably uh a big enough (39:18 - 39:22)
inconvenience for some Churches to be (39:20 - 39:24)
like okay all these cars keep pulling in (39:22 - 39:27)
our parking lot like please leave well (39:24 - 39:29)
here&#39;s some advice Pokémon go players (39:27 - 39:31)
it&#39;s a game for walking not for driving (39:29 - 39:34)
around so walk across the church&#39;s part (39:31 - 39:35)
they&#39;re not going to mind if you walk (39:34 - 39:37)
there is zero sidewalks to get to this (39:35 - 39:39)
church because let me tell you in the (39:37 - 39:41)
middle of of Heartland there are no (39:39 - 39:43)
sidewalks and you have to drive to get (39:41 - 39:45)
anywhere well somebody needs to write a (39:43 - 39:48)
city planner about that and instead (39:45 - 39:51)
of sidewalks well I mean like more of a (39:48 - 39:54)
a a city planning fault than than (39:51 - 39:58)
anything yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s off us small (39:54 - 40:00)
where the speed limits 50 so there are (39:58 - 40:03)
no sidewalks anyways I want to tackle (40:00 - 40:05)
this complaint because it&#39;s more to me (40:03 - 40:08)
of a PSA on this PSA again this is on (40:05 - 40:12)
Reddit it has 2,500 up votes it&#39;s on the (40:08 - 40:15)
Pokémon go subreddit that has (40:12 - 40:18)
750,000 subscribers so this is kind of (40:15 - 40:21)
just a PSA about the PSA for our (40:18 - 40:24)
listeners PSA says iTunes refund Pokémon (40:21 - 40:27)
go purchases this person this person (40:24 - 40:29)
wrote I just got got all my money back (40:27 - 40:30)
that I spent on this game refunded (40:29 - 40:32)
instantly I mentioned that this update (40:30 - 40:34)
killed tracking and third party tracking (40:32 - 40:36)
websites and made the purchases function (40:34 - 40:38)
differently than expected get your (40:36 - 40:42)
refunds Before Time runs out go to here (40:38 - 40:45)
uh I said a game that tracks Pokemon now (40:42 - 40:47)
has no means whether in-game or third (40:45 - 40:50)
party uh to track the Pokemon is is a (40:47 - 40:52)
change in the game function the update (40:50 - 40:54)
changed how the main game is played in (40:52 - 40:56)
terms of tracking the last 2 weeks of (40:54 - 40:57)
purchases should be refunded in (40:56 - 40:59)
instantly here&#39;s the link for Apple (40:57 - 41:04)
here&#39;s the link for Google my PSA is do (40:59 - 41:07)
not do this seems a little silly to me (41:04 - 41:09)
so yes this guy is absolutely right if (41:07 - 41:12)
you complain about an inapp purchase to (41:09 - 41:14)
Apple or Google they will refund your (41:12 - 41:16)
money I&#39;m not sure exactly how Google (41:14 - 41:18)
does it cuz I&#39;ve only ever been in the (41:16 - 41:21)
Apple ecosystem but yes they will do (41:18 - 41:24)
this with really no questions asked but (41:21 - 41:26)
they will remember that forever please (41:24 - 41:29)
note that this person never stated that (41:26 - 41:32)
Apple remembers every time they refund (41:29 - 41:34)
you something so if you know in the (41:32 - 41:37)
future you have a kid or something else (41:34 - 41:40)
happens or you do something stupid like (41:37 - 41:42)
spend $100 on Clash Royale on accident (41:40 - 41:44)
because you were trying to spend $5 that (41:42 - 41:46)
might have happened to me H and you go (41:44 - 41:48)
to Apple and you ask for the refund they (41:46 - 41:50)
will give it to you but in the future if (41:48 - 41:52)
you make that mistake again it probably (41:50 - 41:55)
will not happen and my advice is Pokémon (41:52 - 41:59)
go is one of the few games where you (41:55 - 42:01)
spend money and you don&#39;t feel that (41:59 - 42:02)
ripped (42:01 - 42:04)
off I would say that you don&#39;t feel (42:02 - 42:06)
ripped off at all I would say like $2 (42:04 - 42:09)
for a bag upgrade for 50 more (42:06 - 42:12)
spots I think there&#39;s value to that or (42:09 - 42:16)
80 cents or 800 coins which is 80 cents (42:12 - 42:19)
to get a lucky egg to double the amount (42:16 - 42:22)
of XP that you get for a half hour I (42:19 - 42:24)
think there&#39;s absolutely value in that (42:22 - 42:27)
they could easily charge $5 or $10 or (42:24 - 42:28)
they could (42:27 - 42:31)
charge ridiculous amount of prices for (42:28 - 42:33)
that now I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how much (42:31 - 42:34)
these people spent in Pokémon go I&#39;m (42:33 - 42:36)
just saying like yes you do get a (42:34 - 42:39)
freebie when it comes to refunding Via (42:36 - 42:41)
iTunes via Google but again that is a (42:39 - 42:44)
freebie that is not uh any time I regret (42:41 - 42:47)
the money I spend I get it back cuz it (42:44 - 42:50)
doesn&#39;t work like that also I would (42:47 - 42:52)
disagree with this person in saying that (42:50 - 42:54)
they drastically changed the game The (42:52 - 42:55)
three-step (42:54 - 42:58)
Glitch whether was a glitch or not was (42:55 - 43:02)
broken for almost 2 weeks so whether it (42:58 - 43:05)
was there or not there it&#39;s the game is (43:02 - 43:07)
still doing the the same exact thing (43:05 - 43:08)
it&#39;s been doing for two weeks now they (43:07 - 43:11)
just removed it which in the hindsight (43:08 - 43:12)
makes it less confusing for new players (43:11 - 43:15)
but it&#39;s not like anything has been (43:12 - 43:16)
different in the last two weeks and (43:15 - 43:19)
they&#39;ve they&#39;ve made changes they added (43:16 - 43:21)
trainer customization back they added uh (43:19 - 43:23)
easier way to transfer Pokemon they (43:21 - 43:26)
improved battles like they they yes they (43:23 - 43:28)
removed one thing a thing that&#39;s been (43:26 - 43:31)
broken they&#39;ve also added features so to (43:28 - 43:35)
say that the game is not doing what it (43:31 - 43:37)
originally your original expectations (43:35 - 43:40)
were kind of wrong yeah and they also (43:37 - 43:42)
did not make any changes to anything (43:40 - 43:44)
that you would have spent money on right (43:42 - 43:46)
they didn&#39;t make the bag upgrades 25 (43:44 - 43:48)
slots instead of 50 slots for the same (43:46 - 43:50)
amount of money they didn&#39;t make the (43:48 - 43:52)
incubators not work as well they didn&#39;t (43:50 - 43:55)
you know make the lures work for half as (43:52 - 43:57)
much time they have made no changes to (43:55 - 43:59)
anything you would have spent money on (43:57 - 44:00)
the only change like significant (43:59 - 44:02)
material change they made was on your (44:00 - 44:06)
ability to triangulate on and hunt down (44:02 - 44:08)
Pokemon which is you know in the spirit (44:06 - 44:10)
of the Pokemon world you&#39;re supposed to (44:08 - 44:12)
come across them randomly in The Tall (44:10 - 44:15)
Grass you&#39;re not supposed to triangulate (44:12 - 44:17)
and and find them until you&#39;ve already (44:15 - 44:19)
completed the Pokédex and get the Poke (44:17 - 44:20)
naav or the Poke radar I mean if you (44:19 - 44:22)
wanted to triangulate like Travis said (44:20 - 44:24)
that&#39;s not affecting other players but (44:22 - 44:27)
that&#39;s also if somebody was violating (44:24 - 44:29)
their terms and conditions which it (44:27 - 44:31)
seems like poke Vision was and I don&#39;t (44:29 - 44:33)
know what terms and conditions they were (44:31 - 44:35)
violating but clearly they were (44:33 - 44:37)
violating some terms and conditions that (44:35 - 44:39)
you agreed to when you started playing (44:37 - 44:44)
this game that is if netic didn&#39;t follow (44:39 - 44:47)
its terms and conditions then that sets (44:44 - 44:50)
up a bad ecosystem for the future of (44:47 - 44:53)
this game they can&#39;t just lay out all (44:50 - 44:55)
these terms and conditions and then just (44:53 - 44:59)
let people skip past those cuz you can (44:55 - 45:02)
say right now it&#39;s unfair for them to (44:59 - 45:05)
for them to close down poke Vision but (45:02 - 45:08)
then if they didn&#39;t do that and in two (45:05 - 45:09)
months somebody figures out how to get (45:08 - 45:13)
Mewtwo before everyone else and they (45:09 - 45:16)
start Distributing Mewtwo or or hacking (45:13 - 45:18)
Mewtwo again that&#39;s against their terms (45:16 - 45:20)
and conditions so should they put that (45:18 - 45:22)
banhammer down on the Mewtwo or should (45:20 - 45:24)
they not because you wanted them to lift (45:22 - 45:27)
the banhammer for it&#39;s just they had as (45:24 - 45:30)
a company as being number one in the App (45:27 - 45:32)
Store as having all these player bases (45:30 - 45:35)
you might be unhappy but they have to (45:32 - 45:38)
protect their brand their game and all (45:35 - 45:40)
the players that are playing it so they (45:38 - 45:43)
have to follow the rules that they (45:40 - 45:46)
originally set that is how copyright law (45:43 - 45:50)
works so yes if you don&#39;t uh no I&#39;m not (45:46 - 45:53)
copyright trademark law is it c n which (45:50 - 45:55)
one is it it is trademark I think Trad (45:53 - 45:58)
yeah if you don&#39;t if you do not actively (45:55 - 46:00)
protect it&#39;s actually maritime law would (45:58 - 46:04)
you stop if you do not actively protect (46:00 - 46:06)
your trademark you lose your trademark (46:04 - 46:09)
so it&#39;s almost a requirement that they (46:06 - 46:12)
have to but once again there is no (46:09 - 46:14)
nowhere has anyone said that it was (46:12 - 46:16)
Niantic that asked them to cease and (46:14 - 46:18)
toist they just said on their own that (46:16 - 46:20)
they decided to stop going maybe they (46:18 - 46:22)
didn&#39;t make enough money maybe they made (46:20 - 46:23)
enough money and said well we don&#39;t have (46:22 - 46:25)
to work anymore and we don&#39;t not going (46:23 - 46:27)
to support this it could happen I would (46:25 - 46:30)
do it I would do it the last thing I (46:27 - 46:33)
wanted to touch on for Pokémon go is (46:30 - 46:36)
that a lot of people when I say a lot (46:33 - 46:38)
because I&#39;ve said that a lot this (46:36 - 46:40)
episode so what I&#39;ve seen on Twitter (46:38 - 46:42)
what I&#39;ve seen on Reddit what I&#39;ve seen (46:40 - 46:43)
on Facebook are people are upset that (46:42 - 46:45)
Niantic does a terrible job at (46:43 - 46:47)
communication we&#39;ve known this since (46:45 - 46:49)
before the game was even released when (46:47 - 46:51)
it appeared in Australia and everyone (46:49 - 46:53)
was like let us know if it&#39;s coming or (46:51 - 46:56)
not right we all remember this yeah (46:53 - 46:58)
they&#39;ve have done a poor job at (46:56 - 47:01)
communication up to this point again a (46:58 - 47:04)
lot of people say well just let us know (47:01 - 47:06)
what&#39;s going on just give us a blog post (47:04 - 47:09)
it&#39;s not that hard it&#39;s easy to say that (47:06 - 47:12)
it&#39;s not that hard because none of us (47:09 - 47:15)
know what&#39;s actually going on they also (47:12 - 47:17)
have a job posting for a community (47:15 - 47:19)
manager maybe they don&#39;t even have a (47:17 - 47:21)
person there that could do a community (47:19 - 47:24)
manager when you it&#39;s hard to say that (47:21 - 47:26)
but it&#39;s easy to say it&#39;s not that hard (47:24 - 47:28)
but at the same time somebody has to (47:26 - 47:30)
make sure that what is being (47:28 - 47:32)
communicated is with within the (47:30 - 47:34)
guidelines which is not going to be (47:32 - 47:37)
misinterpreted which is not going to (47:34 - 47:38)
make people more upset now I just wanted (47:37 - 47:42)
to compare their communication to (47:38 - 47:44)
somebody who does communicate every (47:42 - 47:47)
single week which is bungee and I&#39;m not (47:44 - 47:48)
going to go down this Destiny rabbit (47:47 - 47:52)
hole but I see parallels I see (47:48 - 47:54)
similarities in both both these aspects (47:52 - 47:57)
in one aspect the Pokémon go player base (47:54 - 47:59)
is is saying just communicate with us (47:57 - 48:02)
Niantic just tell us something and then (47:59 - 48:04)
in the other aspect the bunge player (48:02 - 48:08)
base they have updated every single week (48:04 - 48:09)
since Destiny has come out which is more (48:08 - 48:12)
than two years every Thursday they have (48:09 - 48:15)
communicated something whether it was (48:12 - 48:17)
major changes whether it was hey we have (48:15 - 48:19)
nothing to report this week but here are (48:17 - 48:22)
some cool videos uh from our community (48:19 - 48:24)
to hey there&#39;s going to be an update (48:22 - 48:25)
next week or there&#39;s going to be an (48:24 - 48:27)
update in two weeks Bungie has (48:25 - 48:30)
communicated every single week at the (48:27 - 48:32)
end of the day the results are still the (48:30 - 48:35)
same both audiences are still not (48:32 - 48:37)
satisfied and I&#39;m a big Destiny player I (48:35 - 48:39)
read the update every single week (48:37 - 48:40)
because I care about what they&#39;re saying (48:39 - 48:43)
and all I see are people going well uh (48:40 - 48:45)
don&#39;t read it guys this update&#39;s useless (48:43 - 48:48)
just wait till next week or oh that&#39;s (48:45 - 48:50)
all you communicated there&#39;s supposed to (48:48 - 48:51)
be an update next week why why don&#39;t you (48:50 - 48:55)
just tell us today it&#39;s just negativity (48:51 - 48:57)
people like to be negative oh yeah (48:55 - 48:58)
people like to be negative and we&#39;ve (48:57 - 49:00)
been negative on the show and we&#39;ve been (48:58 - 49:02)
positive on the show and you know we&#39;re (49:00 - 49:03)
trying (49:02 - 49:07)
to and we&#39;re trying to just cover all (49:03 - 49:10)
aspects of Pokemon but again I&#39;ve seen (49:07 - 49:12)
the I&#39;ve seen the same outcome you have (49:10 - 49:13)
a company that communicates every week (49:12 - 49:14)
and you have a company that has (49:13 - 49:17)
communicated like three Tweets in the (49:14 - 49:20)
last couple weeks and and the player (49:17 - 49:22)
base is reacting the exact same I mean (49:20 - 49:25)
NE antic can come out and say okay guys (49:22 - 49:27)
we took away the three-step glitch which (49:25 - 49:29)
they did say in the update when you read (49:27 - 49:31)
the update notes I I the people that are (49:29 - 49:33)
still upset that the three glitch the (49:31 - 49:36)
three-step glitch is now removed from (49:33 - 49:38)
Niantic say like would you feel better (49:36 - 49:41)
if Niantic said yeah we removed it and (49:38 - 49:42)
uh we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s coming back or (49:41 - 49:44)
not because they probably don&#39;t know if (49:42 - 49:46)
it&#39;s coming back or not maybe they do (49:44 - 49:48)
maybe they don&#39;t maybe it&#39;s not coming (49:46 - 49:50)
back maybe it is but they at that moment (49:48 - 49:52)
they probably don&#39;t know and removing it (49:50 - 49:54)
was probably the best because it didn&#39;t (49:52 - 49:57)
work anyways so why leave it in it just (49:54 - 50:00)
confusing because it was broken and it (49:57 - 50:02)
and it didn&#39;t work I was say if it was (50:00 - 50:04)
helping to balance the servers which is (50:02 - 50:08)
what Logan was indicating or suspecting (50:04 - 50:09)
then wouldn&#39;t you rather have a game (50:08 - 50:11)
that you can log into and use more than (50:09 - 50:14)
that one particular feature well the (50:11 - 50:15)
argument would be if that is the (50:14 - 50:17)
justification then we would like to know (50:15 - 50:21)
it and I I would just say that I I I (50:17 - 50:22)
agree with Steve that that people tend (50:21 - 50:24)
to be dissatisfied regardless of how (50:22 - 50:28)
much communication they have with the (50:24 - 50:30)
developer like um back when I used to (50:28 - 50:32)
play a little bit of League of (50:30 - 50:34)
Legends um which wasn&#39;t that long ago (50:32 - 50:38)
but um they had a thing where they (50:34 - 50:41)
switched their Q system substantially (50:38 - 50:43)
and a lot of and it ended up being kind (50:41 - 50:45)
of poor for like the higher up players (50:43 - 50:46)
it didn&#39;t ever affect me because I&#39;m (50:45 - 50:50)
terrible um but it ended up making Q (50:46 - 50:52)
times very long for higher up players so (50:50 - 50:54)
they had like a round table discussion (50:52 - 50:57)
they like picked like um like a yoube (50:54 - 51:00)
tuber a uh a professional player and (50:57 - 51:03)
then some of Riot&#39;s development team and (51:00 - 51:05)
like Community team and they like had a (51:03 - 51:06)
little like video discussion that that (51:05 - 51:10)
was like very an interesting discussion (51:06 - 51:12)
um and yet the the response was still (51:10 - 51:15)
very negative to that um even though (51:12 - 51:17)
they communicated their reasoning um so (51:15 - 51:19)
while there is validity to that I would (51:17 - 51:21)
also say that the fact that this they (51:19 - 51:24)
released this game granted they they (51:21 - 51:25)
probably didn&#39;t know how big it was (51:24 - 51:27)
going to be but it was going to be a big (51:25 - 51:30)
popular game and they didn&#39;t have a (51:27 - 51:32)
community manager before they hired (51:30 - 51:34)
before they launched it like that the (51:32 - 51:36)
fact that they have a a listing for a (51:34 - 51:38)
community manager now seems like a bit (51:36 - 51:40)
of an afterthought that that they should (51:38 - 51:43)
have been um planning on much before (51:40 - 51:46)
that I would think yeah I just think the (51:43 - 51:48)
the people who are being vocal about not (51:46 - 51:49)
enough communication are probably the (51:48 - 51:51)
same people that would still be (51:49 - 51:54)
unsatisfied if communication was given (51:51 - 51:59)
yes I look at what po go has done and I (51:54 - 52:00)
looked at the update last night and I (51:59 - 52:02)
read the update and I opened the app and (52:00 - 52:05)
it worked and all the bullet points that (52:02 - 52:08)
the updates stated were pretty clear (52:05 - 52:11)
made sense like okay all right the (52:08 - 52:15)
three-step glitch is gone no more steps (52:11 - 52:18)
I get it will it come back maybe will I (52:15 - 52:21)
keep playing it absolutely the threep (52:18 - 52:22)
thing never came back would I still play (52:21 - 52:26)
it yeah I would I don&#39;t know what do you (52:22 - 52:28)
want it&#39;s free (52:26 - 52:29)
if you put money into it and you&#39;re a (52:28 - 52:31)
little upset talk to every person who (52:29 - 52:33)
played World of Warcraft cuz that game (52:31 - 52:36)
has dramatically changed I don&#39;t know (52:33 - 52:38)
it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s definitely passion (52:36 - 52:40)
behind the people that are upset they (52:38 - 52:43)
definitely care the game is less than a (52:40 - 52:45)
month old I guess my advice is you know (52:43 - 52:46)
just give it some time you don&#39;t have to (52:45 - 52:51)
play it every day I played it I put 12 (52:46 - 52:54)
14 hours into Pokémon go in in a weekend (52:51 - 52:56)
I played it a lot now I haven&#39;t touched (52:54 - 52:57)
it for almost a week (52:56 - 52:59)
besides you know oh I&#39;m at the grocery (52:57 - 53:00)
store let me see if there&#39;s any Pokemon (52:59 - 53:03)
around okay just weedles yeah never mind (53:00 - 53:05)
and I&#39;m still having a great time with (53:03 - 53:07)
it there&#39;s only 151 Pokemon there&#39;s (53:05 - 53:10)
supposed to be 700 eventually game has (53:07 - 53:14)
plenty of room to grow and you know in (53:10 - 53:18)
any any game any business any industry (53:14 - 53:19)
anything that there&#39;s that is this (53:18 - 53:21)
popular they might have to take one step (53:19 - 53:24)
back to take three steps forward that&#39;s (53:21 - 53:27)
all I got there (53:24 - 53:30)
with that being said take a break when (53:27 - 53:31)
we come back is our interview with (53:30 - 53:33)
Maryland we&#39;re going to talk about (53:31 - 53:35)

it&#39;s crazy how that&#39;s kind of come to be (56:28 - 56:33)
like my intro my motto cuz I actually (56:30 - 56:35)
remember the days before that was my (56:33 - 56:38)
intro and it&#39;s really bizarre to think (56:35 - 56:42)
of a world of Maryland without that that (56:38 - 56:45)
classic how&#39;s it going everyone Maryland (56:42 - 56:47)
here but there actually was a world (56:45 - 56:48)
before (56:47 - 56:51)
then figure you know I I I watch your (56:48 - 56:53)
stuff from time to time I&#39;m not I&#39;m not (56:51 - 56:55)

sure you have those people out there (56:55 - 56:59)
that are first to comment first to like (56:57 - 57:03)
but uh that always I can&#39;t help but not (56:59 - 57:07)
smile when I hear that intro a lot of (57:03 - 57:09)
people say that and it&#39;s just really (57:07 - 57:11)
awesome knowing that you know it&#39;s so (57:09 - 57:13)
iconic that people want to hear it or it (57:11 - 57:16)
just brings a smile to their face which (57:13 - 57:17)
it&#39;s great I mean that&#39;s a sign of a (57:16 - 57:20)
good intro right totally absolutely when (57:17 - 57:22)
I when we when we changed our theme song (57:20 - 57:26)
it was really good to hear people saying (57:22 - 57:28)
I just I just love the new theme song (57:26 - 57:29)
like I listen to it two or three times (57:28 - 57:31)
before I even start the episode and it&#39;s (57:29 - 57:33)
like okay good cuz we had a theme song (57:31 - 57:35)
for like a 100 episodes and I was like (57:33 - 57:37)
it&#39;s time to change so hopefully people (57:35 - 57:39)
don&#39;t hate this oh man and people hate (57:37 - 57:42)
change any little thing and they will (57:39 - 57:44)
usually tear you apart so it&#39;s great (57:42 - 57:46)
that it&#39;s so good that people loved it (57:44 - 57:49)
anyway yeah totally so for our listeners (57:46 - 57:52)
you actually have been on the show (57:49 - 57:55)
before it was oh gosh almost 120 (57:52 - 57:57)
episodes ago my goodness yeah it has (57:55 - 58:00)
been a while but I do remember that and (57:57 - 58:03)
a lot has changed since then huh totally (58:00 - 58:06)
yeah for for both both my audience and (58:03 - 58:09)
your audience we actually go pretty far (58:06 - 58:12)
back three four years ago um I remember (58:09 - 58:15)
us playing some Pokemon trading card (58:12 - 58:18)
games oh yes oh yes both at uh (58:15 - 58:20)
pre-release events and also I think even (58:18 - 58:23)
like a city or state championship event (58:20 - 58:24)
we even did that and were you at (58:23 - 58:27)
Nationals a few years back yes I (58:24 - 58:29)
remember yeah I remember okay I&#39;m gonna (58:27 - 58:31)
I&#39;m going to tell the story real quick I (58:29 - 58:34)
remember the first time I met you you (58:31 - 58:37)
were actually the head judge at (58:34 - 58:41)
Nationals oh man that was a wild that (58:37 - 58:43)
was the first year black and white were (58:41 - 58:45)
competitive yeah for the video game (58:43 - 58:48)
championships yes yeah oh man that (58:45 - 58:50)
really does go back but that was a lot (58:48 - 58:53)
of fun can let actually let&#39;s let&#39;s talk (58:50 - 58:57)
about that you were head judge of (58:53 - 58:59)
the the Pokemon video games what was how (58:57 - 59:00)
did that happen what was that like I&#39;m (58:59 - 59:02)
sure I&#39;m sure the Pokemon company told (59:00 - 59:04)
you that there are certain aspects you (59:02 - 59:07)
can&#39;t talk about but yeah well it was a (59:04 - 59:09)
while ago and I can&#39;t go into any of (59:07 - 59:11)
like the internals of you know all right (59:09 - 59:13)
how to how to catch people that are (59:11 - 59:15)
causing problems or what we do and of (59:13 - 59:17)
course A lot has changed but um in a (59:15 - 59:21)
nutshell I was contacted one day back in (59:17 - 59:24)
2009 and you know because I&#39;d had my (59:21 - 59:27)
website for a few years now and I found (59:24 - 59:29)
out that uh had quite a few fans in the (59:27 - 59:32)
office too which is kind of nice but uh (59:29 - 59:34)
yeah they reached out to me and and then (59:32 - 59:38)
we kind of got the ball rolling and um I (59:34 - 59:40)
was the head referee for the video game (59:38 - 59:42)
championship series which just launched (59:40 - 59:46)
in 2009 there was an event in 2008 but (59:42 - 59:48)
it was just at I think two (59:46 - 59:51)
locations and starting in 2009 they&#39;d (59:48 - 59:55)
have six cities throughout the us and it (59:51 - 59:58)
would be one each week which was a lot (59:55 - 59:59)
of travel because being the head of (59:58 - 60:01)
referee I&#39;d have to be at each and every (59:59 - 60:03)
one of them so a lot of flying around a (60:01 - 60:05)
lot of meeting people which was just so (60:03 - 60:08)
much fun and of course a lot of Pokemon (60:05 - 60:10)
and then of course I also did uh (60:08 - 60:14)
Nationals and worlds so I did that from (60:10 - 60:18)
2009 to 2011 and I guess uh must have (60:14 - 60:20)
been 2011 that we met then because (60:18 - 60:22)
that&#39;s black and white that was a lot of (60:20 - 60:24)
fun Nationals then yeah it was just (60:22 - 60:27)
really cool like it&#39;s something I never (60:24 - 60:28)
thought I&#39;d be doing in a million years (60:27 - 60:30)
I thought I&#39;d just be grounded in you (60:28 - 60:33)
know my my basic area in southern (60:30 - 60:37)
Wisconsin for most of my life and here I (60:33 - 60:39)
get this opportunity to fly around and (60:37 - 60:40)
meet a whole ton of people and it was (60:39 - 60:43)
just a fantastic opportunity like I (60:40 - 60:46)
still to this day am so grateful I had (60:43 - 60:48)
that opportunity and and hopefully I was (60:46 - 60:50)
a great service to players and keeping (60:48 - 60:52)
things fair and addressing any issues (60:50 - 60:54)
and even just kind of helping organize (60:52 - 60:57)
stuff cuz it was it was quite the (60:54 - 60:59)
undertaking back then yeah I felt like (60:57 - 61:01)
that was the first year where things (60:59 - 61:04)
really kind of took off oh yeah (61:01 - 61:09)
definitely like I remember 2009 and 2010 (61:04 - 61:11)
they did have a few shortcomings here (61:09 - 61:13)
and there and that&#39;s why black and white (61:11 - 61:16)
I really felt was geared towards uh the (61:13 - 61:18)
competitive scene just to kind of help (61:16 - 61:21)
improve things I know that they had the (61:18 - 61:24)
uh IR feature built into the card itself (61:21 - 61:27)
which was rather handy so that did help (61:24 - 61:30)
in a number of ways but it was (61:27 - 61:32)
definitely great to see it grow over the (61:30 - 61:35)
years uh since then because now it&#39;s (61:32 - 61:38)
pretty big Tod do yeah totally you know (61:35 - 61:41)
we met at that Nationals and then you (61:38 - 61:44)
know fast forward probably a year or two (61:41 - 61:46)
and we&#39;re sitting across from each other (61:44 - 61:49)
playing the trading card game in (61:46 - 61:51)
Wisconsin and that was the first time we (61:49 - 61:53)
really had a like a full (61:51 - 61:56)
conversation I think I&#39;ve told the story (61:53 - 61:59)
before or or I don&#39;t remember if if even (61:56 - 62:01)
you were on when I told it but there&#39;s a (61:59 - 62:03)
term in the trading card game called (62:01 - 62:06)
donk which doesn&#39;t really happen anymore (62:03 - 62:08)
not anymore yeah not anymore but what (62:06 - 62:11)
that means is uh the player who goes (62:08 - 62:13)
first that&#39;s technically turned zero and (62:11 - 62:15)
then the player who goes second that&#39;s (62:13 - 62:18)
their first turn so if you can knock the (62:15 - 62:20)
person out before their first turn on (62:18 - 62:22)
turn zero it&#39;s called a donk because you (62:20 - 62:24)
have won the game before that person (62:22 - 62:27)
gets a chance to play and (62:24 - 62:30)
I get paired with Marilyn and I don&#39;t I (62:27 - 62:31)
don&#39;t think we we both were having a (62:30 - 62:33)
pretty bad day that (62:31 - 62:38)
day doesn&#39;t surprise me at least yeah (62:33 - 62:40)
yeah I I I loved how much fun the (62:38 - 62:41)
trading card game was but so yeah we&#39;re (62:40 - 62:43)
sitting again across from each other (62:41 - 62:45)
we&#39;re joking about donking each (62:43 - 62:48)
other and uh I end up winning the coin (62:45 - 62:51)
flip and going first and I have most of (62:48 - 62:54)
the cards able to do it and I I I draw (62:51 - 62:57)
well I lay out everything I think it I (62:54 - 62:58)
think I was playing a flip Tei deck so (62:57 - 63:02)
i&#39; oh my goodness yeah a long time ago I (62:58 - 63:04)
went for the Donk didn&#39;t happen I used (63:02 - 63:06)
flipi so I got one more chance and then (63:04 - 63:10)
I was able to do it and uh it was such a (63:06 - 63:13)
funny and great moment because us being (63:10 - 63:16)
two Pokemon people we could easily look (63:13 - 63:18)
past that game and just kind of We we (63:16 - 63:20)
played casually for the rest of the half (63:18 - 63:22)
hour and we just talked and it was great (63:20 - 63:25)
oh yeah it was awesome and like spirits (63:22 - 63:27)
of players especially back then you know (63:25 - 63:29)
it was just it was light-hearted it&#39;s (63:27 - 63:32)
fun and also just to clarify just in (63:29 - 63:33)
case anyone&#39;s thinking wait how could (63:32 - 63:35)
you attack on the first turn you can&#39;t (63:33 - 63:38)
do that back in those days you could (63:35 - 63:40)
attack on the first turn it was I don&#39;t (63:38 - 63:43)
think you could draw a card back then (63:40 - 63:44)
and then like they changed the rules so (63:43 - 63:47)
often to kind of keep up with things but (63:44 - 63:49)
yeah back then you could attack in the (63:47 - 63:51)
first turn and it did lead to those donk (63:49 - 63:53)
situations which I didn&#39;t really like I (63:51 - 63:56)
mean I can laugh it off I don&#39;t really (63:53 - 63:57)
uh have too much of a problem with it (63:56 - 63:59)
but I know that some people just hated (63:57 - 64:03)
that and I didn&#39;t really like how it it (63:59 - 64:05)
really didn&#39;t lead to a good game (64:03 - 64:07)
because it&#39;s over before you could even (64:05 - 64:09)
do anything yeah but that&#39;s how the game (64:07 - 64:12)
goes the only benefit is now you have (64:09 - 64:14)
the rest of the half hour to go get (64:12 - 64:16)
something to eat or go to the bathroom (64:14 - 64:18)
true there&#39;s definitely advantages to (64:16 - 64:21)
that but when you&#39;re the one doing the (64:18 - 64:24)
dunk then your next half hour feels (64:21 - 64:28)
great uh yeah uh yeah I don&#39;t know I (64:24 - 64:29)
always feel guilty or at least felt (64:28 - 64:32)
guilty whenever I did that cuz I did in (64:29 - 64:33)
my day it&#39;s just the game you kind of (64:32 - 64:35)
had to do it but I never really felt (64:33 - 64:38)
great about it so yeah yeah but it was (64:35 - 64:40)
good that we just kind of sat there and (64:38 - 64:42)
kept talking and everything oh yeah it (64:40 - 64:44)
gave us a good chance to kind of catch (64:42 - 64:47)
up after all that time since Nationals (64:44 - 64:51)
right yeah and uh we we talk off and on (64:47 - 64:54)
I we actually ran into each other oh (64:51 - 64:57)
like six seven months ago at the Pokemon (64:54 - 64:59)
symphonic Evolutions both both shows (64:57 - 65:01)
yeah oh yeah that was great that was I (64:59 - 65:03)
think almost a year ago yeah I think it (65:01 - 65:07)
was July last year was it June yeah I (65:03 - 65:08)
was thinking about that the other day (65:07 - 65:10)
it&#39;s like when was the last time I ran (65:08 - 65:12)
into you and I think it actually was all (65:10 - 65:15)
the way back then yeah wow that was yeah (65:12 - 65:16)
well it&#39;s coming back up in Wisconsin (65:15 - 65:19)
again so I hope so that&#39;ll be great I&#39;m (65:16 - 65:21)
sure I we&#39;ll be meeting again and it&#39;s (65:19 - 65:23)
funny because we we&#39;re in the same state (65:21 - 65:26)
so it not a lot of barriers restricting (65:23 - 65:30)
us from actually hanging out but let&#39;s (65:26 - 65:31)
talk about your website real quick (65:30 - 65:34)
because that it&#39;s it&#39;s an old it&#39;s an (65:31 - 65:38)
old site yeah that&#39;s a story so it&#39;s (65:34 - 65:40)
changed a lot over the years I guess (65:38 - 65:43)
I&#39;ll give a a little timeline here so I (65:40 - 65:47)
started my website maryland.com back in (65:43 - 65:51)
2000 not 200 and insert year here no (65:47 - 65:55)
2000 it was that old um the dawn of the (65:51 - 65:58)
internet as essentially and you know I (65:55 - 66:00)
was just a casual site I just put stuff (65:58 - 66:04)
there but in 2003 I started learning uh (66:00 - 66:06)
like programming languages for the web (66:04 - 66:10)
PHP specifically and that gave my (66:06 - 66:12)
website the ability to do just all sorts (66:10 - 66:15)
of crazy things so I worked on my it was (66:12 - 66:16)
actually a lifelong dream of mine I (66:15 - 66:21)
wanted to make some kind of script or (66:16 - 66:23)
something that would serve as a card (66:21 - 66:25)
database so I could like keep track of (66:23 - 66:26)
all the card (66:25 - 66:28)
that are in existence I could look up (66:26 - 66:30)
their stats I could search I always (66:28 - 66:33)
wanted to do that never knew how and (66:30 - 66:36)
just by studying the online manuals and (66:33 - 66:39)
doing some research here and there I (66:36 - 66:40)
managed to make a script that did that (66:39 - 66:42)
and it was just like the coolest thing (66:40 - 66:45)
ever and I went from there to build like (66:42 - 66:48)
a pokedex and then started writing (66:45 - 66:52)
walkthroughs in 2007 though that was (66:48 - 66:55)
when the uh Diamond and Pearl games were (66:52 - 66:57)
released in the US now a few months (66:55 - 67:00)
earlier I picked up the Japanese copies (66:57 - 67:02)
of both Diamond and Pearl and I started (67:00 - 67:04)
writing a walkthrough for them as well (67:02 - 67:06)
as getting a whole bunch of data from (67:04 - 67:08)
the game to use in the Pokedex so do you (67:06 - 67:11)
and of course sorry do you know Japanese (67:08 - 67:13)
oh yeah that&#39;s a good question um I can (67:11 - 67:16)
read a little bit of Japanese I can&#39;t (67:13 - 67:19)
speak it but I can read some of it uh (67:16 - 67:22)
specifically I can read Katakana almost (67:19 - 67:25)
perfectly like it&#39;s I don&#39;t even have to (67:22 - 67:27)
think it&#39;s just oh okay okay hirana (67:25 - 67:31)
which is um more of a simple Japanese as (67:27 - 67:33)
opposed to kanji which are all the cool (67:31 - 67:35)
kind of symbols and characters and stuff (67:33 - 67:38)
I can read hiragana kanji not so much (67:35 - 67:40)
but the games were only in hiragana and (67:38 - 67:43)
katak back then so I could read some (67:40 - 67:45)
stuff and what I didn&#39;t know I could (67:43 - 67:48)
read enough hugana to type it out and (67:45 - 67:50)
then translate it on like Google (67:48 - 67:53)
translate or infos seek or something but (67:50 - 67:55)
that ended up being a great skill I I (67:53 - 67:57)
learned that back in I think 2000 (67:55 - 67:59)
because I wanted to play gold and silver (67:57 - 68:01)
but they were only in Japanese and I (67:59 - 68:04)
imported them so that was really helpful (68:01 - 68:07)
to have that skill I picked up back then (68:04 - 68:09)
kind of helped in it hardcore Pokemon (68:07 - 68:13)
fan importing Japanese games in 200000 (68:09 - 68:15)
yeah I was just a kid back then man that (68:13 - 68:18)
took so much of my birthday money it was (68:15 - 68:20)
just ridiculous that&#39;s incredible it was (68:18 - 68:22)
so worth it though but yeah the site (68:20 - 68:26)
took off and uh then it it just was (68:22 - 68:30)
fantastic for several years and what (68:26 - 68:31)
happened in (68:30 - 68:34)
2012 was I actually ended up selling my (68:31 - 68:37)
website and then working with the (68:34 - 68:38)
company I sold it to to kind of manage (68:37 - 68:42)
it I sold it to uh curse or curse.com (68:38 - 68:45)
and join their network of sites which (68:42 - 68:48)
was really good I mean it was it was (68:45 - 68:49)
definitely interesting I felt good (68:48 - 68:52)
because I felt like they would kind of (68:49 - 68:54)
be more professional and give me extra (68:52 - 68:56)
security because one of my big fear was (68:54 - 68:58)
you know the Pokemon company would shut (68:56 - 69:01)
me down or something and thankfully (68:58 - 69:03)
never had a problem with them but I (69:01 - 69:05)
figured having the security of being in (69:03 - 69:08)
a site Network and having you know more (69:05 - 69:11)
of a unified kind of control panel for (69:08 - 69:14)
everything their own Forum software and (69:11 - 69:15)
all that so it&#39;s one heck of an upgrade (69:14 - 69:18)
it took several months and we launched (69:15 - 69:20)
it and that&#39;s actually been what the (69:18 - 69:23)
site has been since let&#39;s say 2013 it (69:20 - 69:26)
was around the end of 2012 now (69:23 - 69:29)
recently in uh late (69:26 - 69:32)
2015 just kind of times of change (69:29 - 69:34)
Pokemon was it wasn&#39;t really like (69:32 - 69:37)
dropping off or anything but there were (69:34 - 69:40)
just uh some differences here and there (69:37 - 69:43)
I I was let go from my position there (69:40 - 69:46)
but it actually worked out just fine (69:43 - 69:49)
because we were in good communication (69:46 - 69:51)
and saw a lot of value in the YouTube (69:49 - 69:52)
channel and just the name that I built (69:51 - 69:56)
so um I have to give huge props two Cur (69:52 - 69:58)
for this they were more than willing to (69:56 - 70:00)
work towards letting me continue to use (69:58 - 70:03)
the name and letting me continue to do (70:00 - 70:05)
my YouTube thing which was just fine so (70:03 - 70:08)
I&#39;m doing all right but that&#39;s also why (70:05 - 70:10)
if you type in maryland.com right now at (70:08 - 70:13)
least at the time of this it is (70:10 - 70:15)
currently redirecting to what (70:13 - 70:18)
maryland.com used to be before all this (70:15 - 70:21)
it&#39;s everything that it was um for the (70:18 - 70:23)
past several years it&#39;s just now under (70:21 - 70:26)
the name Aura land which hopefully (70:23 - 70:28)
you&#39;ll get a chuckle out of but yeah (70:26 - 70:31)
it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s all amicable (70:28 - 70:33)
everything&#39;s good with that that&#39;s why (70:31 - 70:35)
Aura land is a thing but I&#39;m I&#39;m no (70:33 - 70:38)
longer associated with it uh I might (70:35 - 70:41)
write there from time to time but it&#39;s (70:38 - 70:43)
it&#39;s mostly just so I can then continue (70:41 - 70:47)
to regrow maryland.com and make it from (70:43 - 70:49)
scratch again which I&#39;m kind of in the (70:47 - 70:52)
process of doing now it&#39;s a long process (70:49 - 70:54)
though oh I I can imagine so Maryland is (70:52 - 70:57)
you again yes Maryland is me I&#39;m (70:54 - 71:01)
Maryland we&#39;re all good and cursed is (70:57 - 71:04)
aeral Aur land they&#39;re evolution of (71:01 - 71:07)
Marland right right but they worked they (71:04 - 71:09)
were what I had given birth to (71:07 - 71:12)
essentially got it got it okay so from (71:09 - 71:15)
that story I have two questions yes uh (71:12 - 71:17)
first one is see you are you first and (71:15 - 71:21)
foremost a coder since you made maryn (71:17 - 71:23)
from scratch it sounds like with PHP and (71:21 - 71:26)
everything um okay I used to say that in (71:23 - 71:30)
fact even over my YouTube success I used (71:26 - 71:33)
to kind of design uh websites and do (71:30 - 71:34)
programming and stuff like that like (71:33 - 71:35)
that&#39;s just what I always saw myself (71:34 - 71:38)
doing however times have changed now (71:35 - 71:41)
first and foremost I am a YouTuber I do (71:38 - 71:44)
YouTube the coding has actually been on (71:41 - 71:45)
the back burner for a while so it&#39;s (71:44 - 71:47)
actually been really kind of challenging (71:45 - 71:50)
getting back into it rebuilding from (71:47 - 71:53)
scratch sure okay uh that&#39;s interesting (71:50 - 71:56)
I second second question question now (71:53 - 71:58)
has has disappeared from my mind but oh (71:56 - 72:01)
no that&#39;s all right I did want to talk I (71:58 - 72:03)
I&#39;ll I&#39;ll think of it eventually I want (72:01 - 72:06)
to talk about your YouTube stuff cuz you (72:03 - 72:09)
that&#39;s I think how I discovered you (72:06 - 72:11)
prior to actually meeting you was your (72:09 - 72:15)
walkthroughs and and Irene and I Irene (72:11 - 72:17)
obviously when we met I before we met I (72:15 - 72:18)
told her I was into Pokemon she jumped (72:17 - 72:20)
on the Pokemon bandwagon right away when (72:18 - 72:22)
we started dating and she used your your (72:20 - 72:25)
videos a lot for reference too but is (72:22 - 72:28)
that still your is that still your main (72:25 - 72:32)
thing then is YouTube content and then (72:28 - 72:34)
website oh definitely like the roles (72:32 - 72:36)
have entirely changed since this whole (72:34 - 72:41)
thing uh YouTube is now my primary thing (72:36 - 72:44)
um because I find just so many people (72:41 - 72:46)
get into my videos and one thing that (72:44 - 72:49)
has changed a lot actually since I don&#39;t (72:46 - 72:53)
know the past four years or so in the (72:49 - 72:56)
past I used to primarily Focus on doing (72:53 - 72:58)
just kind of like walk through tutorial (72:56 - 73:01)
kind of Let&#39;s Plays where you know I&#39;m (72:58 - 73:02)
guiding people through the game it&#39;s (73:01 - 73:05)
more structured as opposed to just oh (73:02 - 73:06)
I&#39;m just going to play this game and see (73:05 - 73:09)
what happens recently though I have (73:06 - 73:12)
found a lot of people enjoying different (73:09 - 73:15)
challenge runs that I do specifically (73:12 - 73:18)
like Nuzlocke or wedlock challenges (73:15 - 73:20)
which basically in a nutshell mean if (73:18 - 73:22)
any of your Pokémon faint they&#39;re (73:20 - 73:25)
considered dead and you have to release (73:22 - 73:28)
them them and that sounds really harsh (73:25 - 73:30)
but it does make the game so much more (73:28 - 73:32)
interesting and quite a bit scary too (73:30 - 73:34)
because you really have to prepare for a (73:32 - 73:37)
whole bunch of situations and another (73:34 - 73:39)
thing with that is you don&#39;t always know (73:37 - 73:40)
what you&#39;re going to get on your team (73:39 - 73:42)
because you can only catch the first (73:40 - 73:46)
Pokemon in any route or any area so you (73:42 - 73:48)
know one game you might get your (73:46 - 73:50)
favorite Pokemon the other you might end (73:48 - 73:52)
up with a zig zigon and it might not (73:50 - 73:55)
doing or might not do very well right (73:52 - 73:57)
but then you give it a chance and it (73:55 - 73:59)
ends up going all the way to the Elite 4 (73:57 - 74:01)
and just totally surprising you like (73:59 - 74:03)
moments like that they&#39;re really cool (74:01 - 74:05)
but I found it&#39;s to be very interesting (74:03 - 74:08)
how my informative style has changed (74:05 - 74:11)
more to an entertainment style where (74:08 - 74:13)
rather than focusing on getting people (74:11 - 74:15)
through the game it&#39;s more sharing my (74:13 - 74:16)
experience which is cool and I I do (74:15 - 74:18)
still do walkthroughs for new games when (74:16 - 74:21)
they come out but that&#39;s not the only (74:18 - 74:23)
thing I do anymore sure actually my (74:21 - 74:26)
question from earlier yeah (74:23 - 74:30)
uh big on YouTube obviously do you have (74:26 - 74:32)
quote I&#39;m like doing air quotes right (74:30 - 74:36)
now a real job or is is the YouTube is (74:32 - 74:38)
the website is everything you do for Mar (74:36 - 74:41)
maryn like 100% of your time that is a (74:38 - 74:45)
very good question so prior to 2012 (74:41 - 74:48)
where I sold the site to curse and work (74:45 - 74:51)
for them my website was my primary job I (74:48 - 74:54)
got absolutely zero doar from YouTube it (74:51 - 74:56)
just wasn&#39;t a thing back then (74:54 - 74:58)
in (74:56 - 75:01)
2011 I think it was there was a bit of (74:58 - 75:04)
an issue on YouTube and I lost all the (75:01 - 75:06)
videos on my channel due to these false (75:04 - 75:09)
dmca strikes and all that it was (75:06 - 75:13)
terrible but um I did manage to get that (75:09 - 75:15)
all back which was great and when I (75:13 - 75:17)
joined curse I also became partnered (75:15 - 75:19)
with them which had been something that (75:17 - 75:22)
had changed in the past year or so since (75:19 - 75:24)
then and that means I could uh monetize (75:22 - 75:27)
my videos which which uh started out (75:24 - 75:30)
pretty nice and it&#39;s still going strong (75:27 - 75:34)
and now with the site kind of in limbo (75:30 - 75:38)
YouTube is now my full-time thing so (75:34 - 75:40)
it&#39;s pretty crazy to think that making (75:38 - 75:44)
videos of Pokemon or other games is (75:40 - 75:46)
something that you can make a living on (75:44 - 75:48)
but I guess another thing to remember is (75:46 - 75:50)
how much time goes into editing each of (75:48 - 75:52)
these videos and recording and (75:50 - 75:54)
commentating and stuff it&#39;s a lot of (75:52 - 75:55)
work it&#39;s definitely (75:54 - 75:58)
a full-time job but it is a full-time (75:55 - 76:00)
job that I do have some control over (75:58 - 76:02)
which is definitely appreciated yeah (76:00 - 76:06)
totally I I don&#39;t dabble in YouTube now (76:02 - 76:08)
uh the the episodes that I record I put (76:06 - 76:10)
them on YouTube just for you know search (76:08 - 76:12)
engine optimization like oh okay (76:10 - 76:14)
somebody stumbled upon that now they can (76:12 - 76:16)
see that oh we&#39;re in iTunes we&#39;re in (76:14 - 76:18)
Google Play and stuff like that but when (76:16 - 76:20)
I when I interviewed Xavier Woods from (76:18 - 76:23)
the WWE and we we filmed some stuff (76:20 - 76:26)
downtown Atlanta I ended up editing Ting (76:23 - 76:27)
and putting that on YouTube and it was a (76:26 - 76:31)
7 minute video and it took over 5 hours (76:27 - 76:34)
to edit 7 minutes I believe it I (76:31 - 76:36)
definitely believe it it does take a lot (76:34 - 76:39)
of time anytime I do like News videos or (76:36 - 76:42)
stuff it takes just hours just for (76:39 - 76:45)
several minutes of content right yeah so (76:42 - 76:46)
yeah I could imagine that that eats up (76:45 - 76:48)
your time that&#39;s why I was curious I was (76:46 - 76:52)
you you you put out so much content what (76:48 - 76:54)
how how would you have time for other (76:52 - 76:56)
stuff yeah every now and then you know (76:54 - 76:58)
sometimes you just get burnt out from it (76:56 - 77:00)
and I I&#39;ve been known to take breaks (76:58 - 77:03)
here and there and sometimes it&#39;s like (77:00 - 77:04)
wait it&#39;s been a week where&#39;s the video (77:03 - 77:07)
where where is it and sometimes (77:04 - 77:09)
YouTubers just need a little bit of time (77:07 - 77:12)
and then they get rejuvenated and can (77:09 - 77:14)
come back at full force and release a (77:12 - 77:16)
whole bunch of fun content right (77:14 - 77:20)
speaking of getting burnt out you do (77:16 - 77:22)
maybe maybe that was a bad segue but you (77:20 - 77:24)
do other stuff besides Pokemon like you (77:22 - 77:27)
have animal crossing videos is that (77:24 - 77:30)
because uh is that because you just kind (77:27 - 77:33)
of like oh I don&#39;t feel like Pokemon (77:30 - 77:36)
this week I feel like Animal Crossing so (77:33 - 77:37)
like we&#39;ll take Animal Crossing for an (77:36 - 77:40)
example I did set up a second Channel (77:37 - 77:42)
called more Maryland a bit back I don&#39;t (77:40 - 77:45)
use it so much anymore just because like (77:42 - 77:47)
that was when my full-time job was with (77:45 - 77:49)
curse and we just kind of wanted to keep (77:47 - 77:51)
all the Pokemon stuff on the Maryland (77:49 - 77:54)
channel so I set up a second channel to (77:51 - 77:56)
kind of put the other videos on there (77:54 - 77:58)
but you know now it&#39;s like yeah I can (77:56 - 78:01)
just put whatever I want wherever I want (77:58 - 78:04)
but those were actually from stream (78:01 - 78:07)
archives so I started up animal crossing (78:04 - 78:10)
a while back I think it was wow almost (78:07 - 78:12)
two years ago it was August (78:10 - 78:15)
2014 and I decided you know what I&#39;m (78:12 - 78:17)
going to stream this every day or at (78:15 - 78:19)
least almost every day I think every (78:17 - 78:22)
weekday and just kind of see what would (78:19 - 78:23)
happen from it because I was looking for (78:22 - 78:25)
things to stream I didn&#39;t really much on (78:23 - 78:28)
Twitch and I thought having some good (78:25 - 78:29)
series going would be good and I thought (78:28 - 78:31)
Animal Crossing would be perfect cuz you (78:29 - 78:32)
know you&#39;ll only play a little bit of it (78:31 - 78:35)
every day and you&#39;ll get your fill but (78:32 - 78:37)
it was interesting because I wanted to (78:35 - 78:40)
experiment in playing other games I (78:37 - 78:42)
around that time also started up this (78:40 - 78:45)
old old SNES game secret of the Stars (78:42 - 78:47)
which is pretty bad (78:45 - 78:50)
jrpg and I just played it I put it on (78:47 - 78:53)
the second Channel but it uh even if it (78:50 - 78:55)
doesn&#39;t do well it was just fun to play (78:53 - 78:58)
now recently on my main Channel I uh I (78:55 - 79:01)
did a playthrough actually several (78:58 - 79:03)
playthroughs of the popular game (79:01 - 79:06)
undertale and I also recently started up (79:03 - 79:08)
Terraria now some people are like wait (79:06 - 79:10)
but you&#39;re supposed to be Pokemon yeah (79:08 - 79:12)
but I also realize that a lot of people (79:10 - 79:15)
they just enjoy seeing me play things (79:12 - 79:18)
and when there&#39;s only so much you can do (79:15 - 79:20)
in a Pokemon game like for instance I&#39;m (79:18 - 79:22)
not much of a competitive battler in the (79:20 - 79:24)
video games uh like for the video game (79:22 - 79:27)
Chan championships I&#39;ll play around but (79:24 - 79:30)
it&#39;s never really been my cup of tea so (79:27 - 79:31)
I know a lot of people that do Pokémon (79:30 - 79:34)
videos they focus on battling because (79:31 - 79:36)
you know you can have new content rather (79:34 - 79:38)
often I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just never been (79:36 - 79:41)
something that I&#39;ve enjoyed so that&#39;s (79:38 - 79:43)
why I turn to doing challenges like (79:41 - 79:46)
nuzlock and wedlock and stuff because (79:43 - 79:50)
they mix things up they are not as uh (79:46 - 79:51)
it&#39;s not as important that you&#39;re (79:50 - 79:53)
extremely thorough with it because your (79:51 - 79:54)
goal isn&#39;t to show people where (79:53 - 79:56)
everything is it&#39;s just to survive the (79:54 - 79:58)
games and the challenge that you&#39;re (79:56 - 80:01)
going through but yeah I don&#39;t know I&#39;m (79:58 - 80:03)
I&#39;m kind of interested in experimenting (80:01 - 80:05)
with more non-pokemon content just to (80:03 - 80:07)
kind of mix it up but of course I&#39;ll (80:05 - 80:09)
always stick to doing plenty of Pokemon (80:07 - 80:12)
content along with it don&#39;t worry sure (80:09 - 80:15)
yeah I mean I I I think you should and I (80:12 - 80:18)
know that this podcast has definitely (80:15 - 80:22)
gone off the rails with stuff and and I (80:18 - 80:23)
think that&#39;s okay and there was a there (80:22 - 80:25)
was a time and place where (80:23 - 80:27)
I didn&#39;t think that was okay or where I (80:25 - 80:28)
listened to other shows that went off (80:27 - 80:32)
the rails mhm and it might be you know I (80:28 - 80:34)
still weigh the ups and downs that it&#39;s (80:32 - 80:38)
probably not good for First Impressions (80:34 - 80:40)
yeah I can see that but for your for (80:38 - 80:42)
your audience who&#39;s coming back week (80:40 - 80:44)
after week or however often you provide (80:42 - 80:47)
content uh like last week I interviewed (80:44 - 80:49)
Dan rikard from Giant Bomb and we spent (80:47 - 80:52)
a half hour talking about anxiety and (80:49 - 80:55)
meditation and mindfulness and that was (80:52 - 80:58)
a conversation that I did want to have (80:55 - 80:59)
and I thought it would be good for our (80:58 - 81:02)
audience and you know 3 4 years ago I (80:59 - 81:04)
would have never had that conversation (81:02 - 81:06)
and to see like to see the fans and the (81:04 - 81:08)
listeners react saying you know thank (81:06 - 81:10)
you so much for talking about this and I (81:08 - 81:12)
really enjoyed this episode and uh where (81:10 - 81:14)
can I buy that book you guys talked (81:12 - 81:17)
about even though it was maybe you know (81:14 - 81:20)
20 people that came out and said that (81:17 - 81:22)
that alone made that conversation worth (81:20 - 81:26)
it oh definitely and those are your core (81:22 - 81:28)
people that are tuning in that want to (81:26 - 81:31)
hear you and it doesn&#39;t even matter what (81:28 - 81:34)
you do that&#39;s the thing and that&#39;s kind (81:31 - 81:36)
of what I realize with my Channel people (81:34 - 81:39)
they want just to either hear something (81:36 - 81:41)
or watch something and just have that (81:39 - 81:45)
personality so I think in U in your case (81:41 - 81:46)
it&#39;s very much the personality and (81:45 - 81:49)
having the conversation in mind it&#39;s (81:46 - 81:52)
just hey I&#39;m an Entertainer you know you (81:49 - 81:53)
enjoyed my Pokemon series maybe you&#39;ll (81:52 - 81:56)
enjoy this and maybe you won&#39;t but I&#39;m (81:53 - 81:58)
having fun playing it and at the end of (81:56 - 82:00)
the day that&#39;s that&#39;s what I think uh (81:58 - 82:02)
that&#39;s what I think matters is if you&#39;re (82:00 - 82:06)
having fun or enjoying what you&#39;re doing (82:02 - 82:08)
right right yeah I I I have to say (82:06 - 82:09)
though when you started doing the Animal (82:08 - 82:11)
Crossing stuff that&#39;s when that&#39;s when I (82:09 - 82:13)
was like yeah this is this is awesome (82:11 - 82:16)
like I want to see you do more St like (82:13 - 82:18)
you&#39;re you&#39;re the like I&#39;m the Pokemon (82:16 - 82:20)
podcast you&#39;re the you&#39;re Maryland we&#39;re (82:18 - 82:24)
known we&#39;re known for Pokemon but I (82:20 - 82:25)
there&#39;s when I I saw you start doing (82:24 - 82:27)
that I was like there is so much more (82:25 - 82:29)
here it&#39;s almost like you see another (82:27 - 82:30)
side of a person even though it&#39;s just a (82:29 - 82:33)
different game yeah definitely and man I (82:30 - 82:36)
tell you I almost want to revisit animal (82:33 - 82:38)
crossing of the town of benon again (82:36 - 82:40)
because going off the rails for a second (82:38 - 82:42)
here because that&#39;s totally cool a new (82:40 - 82:46)
patch coming to Animal Crossing a patch (82:42 - 82:48)
for what a three-year-old game that&#39;s (82:46 - 82:51)
crazy you know I have amazing I have all (82:48 - 82:53)
those Animal Crossing amiibos because I (82:51 - 82:57)
love animal in so much and I was really (82:53 - 83:00)
I actually liked the Wii U version the (82:57 - 83:02)
the board game thing I liked it it was (83:00 - 83:04)
it was fun for when you had casual (83:02 - 83:08)
friends over um oh totally I tell you I (83:04 - 83:10)
saw that announced at E3 and I&#39;m like oh (83:08 - 83:13)
man the dream is dead of a Wii U Animal (83:10 - 83:14)
Crossing and I was just so reluctant to (83:13 - 83:16)
it but I played it with two different (83:14 - 83:18)
friends and it was just really relaxed (83:16 - 83:20)
it&#39;s kind of like Mario party but even (83:18 - 83:24)
more chill and with Animal Crossing so I (83:20 - 83:26)
definitely had fun with it and I think (83:24 - 83:27)
it&#39;s better than a lot of people give it (83:26 - 83:30)
credit for it&#39;s not the greatest but it (83:27 - 83:32)
is kind of fun it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like one (83:30 - 83:34)
of those games where you have friends (83:32 - 83:36)
that comeing out of town and you want to (83:34 - 83:38)
talk with them but you you want to have (83:36 - 83:41)
something just so your hands can move or (83:38 - 83:43)
or something it&#39;s it&#39;s really great for (83:41 - 83:46)
that it&#39;s awesome for just like a a very (83:43 - 83:49)
casual social game that doesn&#39;t even (83:46 - 83:52)
take much skill or anything like Mario (83:49 - 83:54)
party you know man my goodness I have (83:52 - 83:55)
friends they they try to get me to play (83:54 - 83:57)
Mario party after I don&#39;t know how many (83:55 - 83:59)
years and it&#39;s like all right how do I (83:57 - 84:01)
do all these different mini games again (83:59 - 84:03)
and it&#39;s just confusing it&#39;s like I just (84:01 - 84:05)
keep getting destroyed whereas with this (84:03 - 84:08)
it&#39;s it&#39;s a board game it doesn&#39;t have (84:05 - 84:10)
any wacky Mini gamess at the end of (84:08 - 84:12)
every turn or anything like that you (84:10 - 84:14)
just have it on in the background chat a (84:12 - 84:17)
bit laugh at funny situations that (84:14 - 84:18)
happen there have been some funny (84:17 - 84:21)
situations in just the several games I (84:18 - 84:23)
played I I think I ended up getting like (84:21 - 84:25)
990,000 Bell (84:23 - 84:27)
on some random event and I just everyone (84:25 - 84:29)
was just like wait what what just (84:27 - 84:31)
happened oh yeah I had one of those (84:29 - 84:33)
moments where somebody got a ridiculous (84:31 - 84:35)
amount of bells and we&#39;re all laughing (84:33 - 84:38)
and then the next moment uh the two (84:35 - 84:39)
characters bumped into each other and (84:38 - 84:41)
they both dropped their wallets and all (84:39 - 84:43)
of a sudden all that money switched (84:41 - 84:46)
hands and it was just one of the oh (84:43 - 84:48)
that&#39;s so good funniest moments of the (84:46 - 84:50)
night and it&#39;s like that moment alone (84:48 - 84:53)
made the game worth it like oh yeah as (84:50 - 84:54)
my group of friends will never forget (84:53 - 84:56)
that like that was super funny yeah (84:54 - 84:58)
definitely and even like that Island (84:56 - 85:00)
mini game was pretty neat I only played (84:58 - 85:02)
it a few times but it&#39;s cool that you (85:00 - 85:04)
can kind of take some of the amiibo (85:02 - 85:06)
cards and you know let&#39;s say you have (85:04 - 85:07)
your favorite villagers you kind of get (85:06 - 85:09)
to have them interact together which is (85:07 - 85:11)
just it&#39;s kind of neat it&#39;s like an RPG (85:09 - 85:13)
mode almost yeah yeah so are you going (85:11 - 85:15)
to are you going to go back to Animal (85:13 - 85:17)
Crossing because of the patch I don&#39;t (85:15 - 85:20)
know if I&#39;m going to uh like stream or (85:17 - 85:23)
do videos on it again but I I definitely (85:20 - 85:25)
want to revisit it it&#39;s kind of been (85:23 - 85:28)
left in a frozen state for a while so (85:25 - 85:29)
I&#39;m almost afraid to see what will (85:28 - 85:31)
happen I haven&#39;t visited benon I have (85:29 - 85:34)
another game uh a physical copy of it (85:31 - 85:36)
and I loaded that up and it was it was (85:34 - 85:38)
fun to kind of revisit that town but (85:36 - 85:42)
it&#39;s uh I&#39;m excited for the patch we&#39;ll (85:38 - 85:44)
have to see maybe I&#39;ll do more since you (85:42 - 85:48)
really like it sure yeah yeah let&#39;s uh (85:44 - 85:50)
let&#39;s switch gears a little bit Pokemon (85:48 - 85:54)
Sun and Moon are coming out oh man how (85:50 - 85:57)
man excited are you I&#39;m pretty excited I (85:54 - 85:59)
know at first there was such little (85:57 - 86:01)
information about it like when they (85:59 - 86:05)
announced the games in February late (86:01 - 86:08)
February uh it&#39;s like oh this is great (86:05 - 86:10)
but there was just this complete drought (86:08 - 86:12)
or no they announced the games was it (86:10 - 86:14)
March (86:12 - 86:17)
January was it January was it January (86:14 - 86:18)
just a title screen and then March is (86:17 - 86:21)
when we saw the first kind of look at (86:18 - 86:22)
yeah I&#39;m trying to remember I just (86:21 - 86:24)
remember that there was so much time (86:22 - 86:27)
before we knew any information and it&#39;s (86:24 - 86:29)
funny cuz that now that&#39;s like 6 months (86:27 - 86:32)
ago oh yeah and man I tell you July has (86:29 - 86:34)
just been and you get a Pokemon and you (86:32 - 86:36)
get a Pokemon and you get a Pokemon (86:34 - 86:37)
they&#39;ve been showing new Pokemon left (86:36 - 86:40)
and right it&#39;s been actually kind of (86:37 - 86:42)
difficult to keep up with it yeah I love (86:40 - 86:45)
it in one aspect I love seeing what (86:42 - 86:48)
we&#39;re getting but at the same time I I (86:45 - 86:51)
talked about this on another show but I (86:48 - 86:53)
remember the first time I ran into (86:51 - 86:55)
Hawlucha oh (86:53 - 86:58)
I was so ex cuz I didn&#39;t know any of the (86:55 - 87:01)
Pokemon in X and Y going in oh and so to (86:58 - 87:03)
see Hawlucha and I was like I don&#39;t know (87:01 - 87:04)
if this is rare I don&#39;t know if this is (87:03 - 87:06)
unique I don&#39;t know what this evolve I (87:04 - 87:08)
don&#39;t even know what type this that was (87:06 - 87:12)
so exciting to me and I I hope I have (87:08 - 87:15)
that moment in Sun and Moon and I and if (87:12 - 87:16)
they keep showing Pokemon I don&#39;t know (87:15 - 87:17)
if that&#39;s going to (87:16 - 87:19)
happen I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll show (87:17 - 87:22)
everything but they&#39;ve shown quite a lot (87:19 - 87:23)
that actually gives me a lot of hope (87:22 - 87:26)
that it&#39;ll be a rather uh rather large (87:23 - 87:28)
set of new Pokemon which will be good (87:26 - 87:30)
but yeah that&#39;s a difficult a difficult (87:28 - 87:32)
kind of situation to be in in the days (87:30 - 87:36)
of the internet now because you see (87:32 - 87:40)
stuff posted on Twitter Tumblr Facebook (87:36 - 87:42)
and it you can&#39;t really avoid the (87:40 - 87:45)
spoilers and I guess me personally I&#39;ve (87:42 - 87:48)
always been a fan that likes to know all (87:45 - 87:50)
the information like I&#39;ll always look (87:48 - 87:53)
all the stuff up before it&#39;s released (87:50 - 87:55)
and it changed a little bit an X and Y (87:53 - 87:56)
because I didn&#39;t want to know who the (87:55 - 87:58)
champion was I was really holding out (87:56 - 88:00)
that the champion would be Sycamore (87:58 - 88:02)
because I thought that would be awesome (88:00 - 88:04)
and I remember being very disappointed (88:02 - 88:07)
when I actually found out who it was but (88:04 - 88:09)
it&#39;s it was that kind of mystery that I (88:07 - 88:11)
enjoyed but knowing about like the (88:09 - 88:13)
different Pokemon and their stats and (88:11 - 88:15)
stuff I thought was important for me as (88:13 - 88:18)
a Pokemon fan and also someone running (88:15 - 88:21)
the website to know I I don&#39;t know maybe (88:18 - 88:24)
I&#39;ll be a little bit more in the dark on (88:21 - 88:26)
the newer Pokemon I guess since the (88:24 - 88:29)
website&#39;s kind of in a limbo state right (88:26 - 88:31)
now I&#39;m not as urgently in need of (88:29 - 88:33)
updating it with sun and moon stuff so (88:31 - 88:35)
it could kind of be fun going in Sun and (88:33 - 88:38)
Moon without is that what you&#39;re gonna (88:35 - 88:41)
be doing you know if you can you know if (88:38 - 88:44)
if if Pokemon tweets it and or sends the (88:41 - 88:46)
press releases I&#39;m obviously going to (88:44 - 88:49)
report on it yeah but if if there if if (88:46 - 88:51)
it&#39;s like the week before and there&#39;s a (88:49 - 88:53)
giant list of all of them leaked I think (88:51 - 88:56)
oh I hate those think I can wait a (88:53 - 89:00)
week yeah I actually did for X and Y it (88:56 - 89:03)
leaked and I was just so sad because we (89:00 - 89:06)
came so far and you know even though I (89:03 - 89:07)
would have looked the stuff up maybe (89:06 - 89:10)
like a day or so before it just felt (89:07 - 89:13)
like come on is this really how we want (89:10 - 89:15)
the information to be released and some (89:13 - 89:19)
weird leak I remember when it I remember (89:15 - 89:21)
that leak because right before the (89:19 - 89:24)
entire leak they they leaked the final (89:21 - 89:28)
evolution of the starters oh yeah and I (89:24 - 89:31)
and so I saw both links and I was like (89:28 - 89:34)
well I I have like four days to go I&#39;m (89:31 - 89:36)
just I&#39;m just going to look at the three (89:34 - 89:38)
starters and I did that and I was (89:36 - 89:41)
satisfied and that that made me pick uh (89:38 - 89:44)
fenin just based on Del Fox but I I was (89:41 - 89:47)
able to not look at that giant that (89:44 - 89:49)
giant leak and and it was only like 4 (89:47 - 89:51)
days but no it felt good cuz like that (89:49 - 89:54)
Hawlucha moment and you know just seeing (89:51 - 89:56)
new Pokemon for the first time was like (89:54 - 89:58)
the first time I saw G was also a moment (89:56 - 90:00)
where I was like I don&#39;t know what this (89:58 - 90:03)
thing is but it looks (90:00 - 90:06)
awesome yeah so yeah what is there a (90:03 - 90:08)
specific thing in Sun and Moon you&#39;re (90:06 - 90:11)
excited for oh man I mean obviously (90:08 - 90:14)
trucks like look at all those trucks I (90:11 - 90:16)
just I love that in the concept art I (90:14 - 90:17)
think that really neat I don&#39;t think (90:16 - 90:20)
it&#39;s actually going to play a role but (90:17 - 90:21)
I&#39;m really excited that trainer (90:20 - 90:23)
customization is returning that&#39;s just (90:21 - 90:27)
something that felt was so missing from (90:23 - 90:29)
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire that I (90:27 - 90:32)
think this will be just so refreshing (90:29 - 90:34)
being able to change my clothes again (90:32 - 90:37)
but yes I don&#39;t know I I recently had a (90:34 - 90:41)
situation in one of my Series where I I (90:37 - 90:43)
used a poison type move against (90:41 - 90:46)
Aerodactyl thinking oh well I know that (90:43 - 90:49)
ground resists poison but uh I I don&#39;t (90:46 - 90:52)
think Rock does and sure enough it did (90:49 - 90:55)
so I&#39;m like oh wow feel really dumb now (90:52 - 90:58)
but if I had sun and moon that wouldn&#39;t (90:55 - 91:01)
be an issue yeah they tell you yeah they (90:58 - 91:03)
tell you now what are your thoughts on (91:01 - 91:05)
that because I found a lot of people (91:03 - 91:08)
were really hesitant to that idea and I (91:05 - 91:10)
guess me personally I think it&#39;s a great (91:08 - 91:13)
tool for newer players and even veterans (91:10 - 91:15)
alike I mean people that say that it (91:13 - 91:17)
takes away the challenge I was (91:15 - 91:20)
memorizing really challenging right yeah (91:17 - 91:23)
no I I I have to agree with you that I (91:20 - 91:25)
think it&#39;s a great tool and I think it&#39;s (91:23 - 91:27)
it breaks down the barrier for people (91:25 - 91:31)
who might find that stuff intimidating (91:27 - 91:35)
for it to exist it was almost similar to (91:31 - 91:37)
telling somebody not to use a calculator (91:35 - 91:40)
to do math yeah that&#39;s exactly it it&#39;s (91:37 - 91:42)
like you know at the end of the day you (91:40 - 91:44)
have all of your moves you&#39;re not going (91:42 - 91:46)
to be changing the mid battle unless (91:44 - 91:49)
well you level up or something but what (91:46 - 91:51)
does it matter if you see if a move is (91:49 - 91:54)
super effective or not it just helps (91:51 - 91:57)
right I mean if if if if you&#39;re actually (91:54 - 92:00)
competitive you&#39;re you shouldn&#39;t be (91:57 - 92:02)
banking on the fact that your opponent (92:00 - 92:04)
might not know the types as well as you (92:02 - 92:06)
like that&#39;s not that&#39;s not a good (92:04 - 92:09)
strategy right exactly it&#39;s like yeah (92:06 - 92:11)
you you should know that already both (92:09 - 92:14)
players should and most of the time (92:11 - 92:16)
people do stuff for memory anyway but I (92:14 - 92:18)
just think it makes the game so much (92:16 - 92:19)
more accessible I wouldn&#39;t mind if there (92:18 - 92:22)
was a toggle for that like if people (92:19 - 92:24)
just really didn&#39;t want to see that for (92:22 - 92:28)
whatever reason hey go for it yeah maybe (92:24 - 92:29)
maybe they could challenge themselves (92:28 - 92:31)
because they Pride themselves on (92:29 - 92:33)
memorizing that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know a (92:31 - 92:35)
lot of people do it&#39;s weird I don&#39;t I (92:33 - 92:37)
don&#39;t get it it&#39;s like you know but I do (92:35 - 92:40)
like that it also shows uh stat boosts (92:37 - 92:43)
and abilities and things like that I (92:40 - 92:46)
think that&#39;s just a great idea yeah yeah (92:43 - 92:48)
I am excited for that I think the (92:46 - 92:49)
biggest thing I was excited for was the (92:48 - 92:52)
character customization coming back yep (92:49 - 92:54)
oh definitely that&#39;s that&#39;s really good (92:52 - 92:56)
and of course multiple Islands I think (92:54 - 92:59)
that&#39;ll be neat yeah this this hyper (92:56 - 93:01)
trining stuff yeah what are your (92:59 - 93:03)
thoughts on that I I&#39;m really intrigued (93:01 - 93:06)
by it I think that the ability to cuz (93:03 - 93:09)
presumably it&#39;s what will raise your (93:06 - 93:11)
individual values your IVs like they&#39;ve (93:09 - 93:12)
all but confirmed it I know that they (93:11 - 93:15)
don&#39;t use the IV language specifically (93:12 - 93:17)
but we know what it is and I think (93:15 - 93:20)
that&#39;s been one of the biggest hurdles (93:17 - 93:22)
to clear when you&#39;re dealing with (93:20 - 93:24)
competitive battles it&#39;s the the fact (93:22 - 93:26)
that you know you have an individual (93:24 - 93:28)
value for all six stats for every (93:26 - 93:31)
individual Pokemon you find so you know (93:28 - 93:33)
you could get something in the wild and (93:31 - 93:35)
it&#39;s really cool but it has terrible IVs (93:33 - 93:38)
or like a shiny yeah exactly like a (93:35 - 93:39)
shiny or something you know it could be (93:38 - 93:41)
great it could look cool but you can&#39;t (93:39 - 93:44)
really use it competitively because its (93:41 - 93:47)
stats it&#39;s like default stats it&#39;s base (93:44 - 93:49)
they they often call it I think no base (93:47 - 93:51)
stats are EES in the game but whatever (93:49 - 93:54)
the case yeah the um the fact that now (93:51 - 93:57)
you can&#39;t actually train them Beyond (93:54 - 94:00)
just their starting set Amounts is (93:57 - 94:03)
brilliant because they did make (94:00 - 94:06)
improvements in Gen 6 for instance (94:03 - 94:09)
breeding it&#39;s relatively trivial to get (94:06 - 94:13)
a five or even a 6 IV Pokemon whereas in (94:09 - 94:15)
generation five and earlier really the (94:13 - 94:19)
only ways you could get a perfect IV (94:15 - 94:21)
Pokemon was through either cheating or (94:19 - 94:24)
through like RNG manipulation which you (94:21 - 94:27)
know some people kind of have issue with (94:24 - 94:29)
and understandably but they did make (94:27 - 94:31)
that more accessible legendaries always (94:29 - 94:34)
have three perfect IVs which is good uh (94:31 - 94:36)
you can get Pokemon in the friend (94:34 - 94:39)
safaris that have two IVs like they do (94:36 - 94:41)
give options for that but I think this (94:39 - 94:44)
will be just the ultimate way to let (94:41 - 94:46)
players use their starter Pokemon (94:44 - 94:49)
competitively that has trash IVs but (94:46 - 94:52)
they can hypertrain to bring it up to (94:49 - 94:55)
perfect IVs as opposed to just having to (94:52 - 94:57)
breed it and hey tough luck kid that (94:55 - 95:00)
favorite Pokemon of yours well it (94:57 - 95:01)
doesn&#39;t have good IVs so you can&#39;t use (95:00 - 95:04)
it yeah and of course it&#39;ll be nice for (95:01 - 95:06)
legendaries too because you won&#39;t have (95:04 - 95:08)
to worry so much about soft fre setting (95:06 - 95:10)
for them you can just catch one level it (95:08 - 95:13)
up to level 100 and max out its IVs (95:10 - 95:16)
hopefully that way yeah especially since (95:13 - 95:18)
there&#39;s been a legendary every month (95:16 - 95:20)
being distributed oh yeah that&#39;s right (95:18 - 95:23)
hey and they&#39;re already at level 100 so (95:20 - 95:25)
can h right away I don&#39;t have time to (95:23 - 95:28)
soft reset let me log in download good (95:25 - 95:31)
to go oh man I just keep mining the (95:28 - 95:33)
Wonder cards I&#39;m like I&#39;m gonna soft res (95:31 - 95:36)
set for this someday someday I almost (95:33 - 95:38)
forgot my Shaman the other day I think (95:36 - 95:40)
was actually Monday morning at like 400 (95:38 - 95:44)
a.m. and I&#39;m like oh shoot I think (95:40 - 95:46)
Shaman ran out yesterday I hope it&#39;s (95:44 - 95:48)
still available and sure enough it was (95:46 - 95:50)
so I picked up a few on my different (95:48 - 95:53)
games I still have the dark cry card (95:50 - 95:55)
sitting on my desk I haven&#39;t redeemed it (95:53 - 95:58)
I have I have till the 31st of August to (95:55 - 96:00)
get him but oh get on that dark R is (95:58 - 96:02)
pretty cool yeah he&#39;s really cool I (96:00 - 96:04)
don&#39;t think I got dark cry though but (96:02 - 96:07)
I&#39;ve already had a dark cry from events (96:04 - 96:11)
past it&#39;s like ah so are you doing are (96:07 - 96:12)
you doing a walkthrough for Sun and Moon (96:11 - 96:13)
what are your what are your plans for (96:12 - 96:16)
the game I haven&#39;t fully decided what (96:13 - 96:18)
I&#39;m going to be doing because in the (96:16 - 96:21)
past I&#39;d also be tasked with writing a (96:18 - 96:23)
walkthrough for the site well I don&#39;t (96:21 - 96:25)
think I&#39;m going to the site fully ready (96:23 - 96:28)
for that by the launch maybe I will but (96:25 - 96:30)
I&#39;m not counting on it so I&#39;m probably (96:28 - 96:32)
just going to focus on YouTube a lot of (96:30 - 96:34)
people have been saying I should do like (96:32 - 96:36)
a Nuzlocke or something on it and I (96:34 - 96:39)
think that might be a little crazy but (96:36 - 96:41)
it could be kind of fun but I think my (96:39 - 96:44)
my general idea of what I want to do is (96:41 - 96:47)
do kind of a not like a full walkthr I&#39;m (96:44 - 96:48)
going to show you where everything is (96:47 - 96:50)
but I&#39;ll just try to show as much of the (96:48 - 96:52)
game as I can maybe go back and pick (96:50 - 96:55)
stuff up later if I read where is and (96:52 - 96:56)
just try to have a whole bunch of (96:55 - 96:58)
content up there for people to watch I (96:56 - 97:00)
just have to be mindful that (96:58 - 97:02)
unfortunately it will be released in (97:00 - 97:05)
Europe a few days later so it&#39;s really (97:02 - 97:08)
going to be painful for all my European (97:05 - 97:12)
viewers yeah yeah but that&#39;s just kind (97:08 - 97:14)
of how it goes sometimes to yeah you (97:12 - 97:17)
have no control over that oh yeah (97:14 - 97:18)
obviously sun and moon coming out a (97:17 - 97:20)
little bit later but we have Pokemon go (97:18 - 97:24)
right now oh yeah that has been just (97:20 - 97:26)
taking the internet and the World by (97:24 - 97:29)
storm I can&#39;t believe it yeah we&#39;re I (97:26 - 97:32)
think think it&#39;s week three of it and (97:29 - 97:36)
it&#39;s died down a little bit a little but (97:32 - 97:40)
a little still crazy very crazy uh how (97:36 - 97:42)
much have you played have you enjoyed it (97:40 - 97:44)
was like a loaded question I&#39;m just oh (97:42 - 97:46)
yeah spitting them off let&#39;s no that&#39;s (97:44 - 97:48)
fine that&#39;s fine I&#39;m actually a little (97:46 - 97:50)
embarrassed I I&#39;m only level seven I&#39;m (97:48 - 97:53)
not you know super into it or anything I (97:50 - 97:55)
I don&#39;t live in a well actually I do (97:53 - 97:58)
live in an area that&#39;s kind of close to (97:55 - 98:00)
actually quite a few Poké stops but it&#39;s (97:58 - 98:01)
it&#39;s just kind of weird I don&#39;t like (98:00 - 98:04)
going out without anyone kind of tagging (98:01 - 98:06)
along you know it&#39;s agree it&#39;s a very (98:04 - 98:09)
social game and I I did have a chance (98:06 - 98:11)
actually when I was at the uh steam (98:09 - 98:15)
Siege pre-release in the Rockford area (98:11 - 98:18)
to just play a whole bunch of Pokemon go (98:15 - 98:20)
down there there was a poké stop at the (98:18 - 98:22)
store it had lures going left and right (98:20 - 98:24)
so I just got all sorts of stuff and it (98:22 - 98:26)
was just so much fun when I was actually (98:24 - 98:28)
around other people that were playing it (98:26 - 98:31)
because you know it&#39;s like oh there&#39;s a (98:28 - 98:33)
a Pokemon over there there&#39;s a Haunter a (98:31 - 98:35)
Tauros and it was just really fun (98:33 - 98:37)
because we&#39;d go outside and and try to (98:35 - 98:39)
find where it is and it was just great (98:37 - 98:41)
and we saw other people that weren&#39;t (98:39 - 98:43)
even at the store that were playing (98:41 - 98:45)
Pokémon go and it just a really fun (98:43 - 98:46)
social experience it&#39;s one of those (98:45 - 98:49)
games that I do feel is best if you play (98:46 - 98:51)
it with like a few friends you go out (98:49 - 98:53)
exploring for some Pokemon you meet some (98:51 - 98:56)
new friends and you&#39;re out and about but (98:53 - 98:58)
man I I look at pictures online of you (98:56 - 99:01)
know parks and beaches just filled with (98:58 - 99:03)
people and their cell phones holding up (99:01 - 99:05)
the phones looking for Pokemon it&#39;s (99:03 - 99:08)
surreal it&#39;s completely surreal it feels (99:05 - 99:10)
like when Pokemon was released back in (99:08 - 99:11)
uh (99:10 - 99:14)
1998 and The Craze kind of even spilled (99:11 - 99:17)
over on a 1999 do do you remember those (99:14 - 99:19)
days where I do back then yeah I I (99:17 - 99:21)
remember being on the bus and every (99:19 - 99:24)
single kid having either a game out with (99:21 - 99:26)
Pokemon or they have a handful of cards (99:24 - 99:28)
that they&#39;re sorting through doesn&#39;t it (99:26 - 99:31)
feel like that all over again with go it (99:28 - 99:34)
does and it to me it feels even bigger (99:31 - 99:37)
just it yeah no kidding over 80 million (99:34 - 99:39)
downloads from what I&#39;ve heard crazy (99:37 - 99:40)
crazy yeah there&#39;s still the top (99:39 - 99:43)
grossing app in the uh iTunes store too (99:40 - 99:46)
which analysts have said if you&#39;re in (99:43 - 99:47)
that spot you&#39;re making one to two (99:46 - 99:51)
million dollar a day oh yeah easily well (99:47 - 99:54)
if if you&#39;re in my neck of the woods I (99:51 - 99:56)
can take you to some great places where (99:54 - 99:58)
there are some some good uh good Pok (99:56 - 100:00)
spots up there yeah we got a a lot of (99:58 - 100:04)
good Poké stops but nice so level seven (100:00 - 100:05)
yeah have you (100:04 - 100:08)
joined team here goes the question (100:05 - 100:11)
that&#39;s going to upset about uh well I&#39;d (100:08 - 100:14)
say onethird of the base but let&#39;s face (100:11 - 100:16)
it you know it&#39;s only going to be (100:14 - 100:19)
half yeah so I did decide to join team (100:16 - 100:22)
Mystic because it it does represent me (100:19 - 100:25)
like you even just reading everything I (100:22 - 100:28)
love blue but yeah an Articuno is the (100:25 - 100:30)
coolest obviously I think so too but are (100:28 - 100:33)
you on team mytic I am yeah oh yeah (100:30 - 100:34)
there we go high five have internet high (100:33 - 100:36)
five I read I read all three and I (100:34 - 100:39)
thought Mystic did line up with what I (100:36 - 100:42)
believed in oh yeah definitely and I (100:39 - 100:43)
think it&#39;s important to you know choose (100:42 - 100:45)
kind of what you believe in or if you (100:43 - 100:46)
have like one of the legendary birds (100:45 - 100:48)
that you really do like you know go with (100:46 - 100:51)
that team but I don&#39;t know I&#39;m I&#39;m (100:48 - 100:54)
really mixed on it like I do love the (100:51 - 100:56)
just kind of mild Trash Talk between (100:54 - 100:58)
teams that doesn&#39;t bother me but I think (100:56 - 101:01)
people get carried away with it no come (100:58 - 101:03)
on I mean we are all kind of team (101:01 - 101:05)
Harmony as they&#39;ve been floating that (101:03 - 101:08)
around with Lugia and everything yeah I (101:05 - 101:11)
think the I think the playfulness of of (101:08 - 101:13)
like chanting your team name when when (101:11 - 101:16)
you capture uh Jim in the area I think (101:13 - 101:19)
that&#39;s great I think oh yeah just people (101:16 - 101:20)
yelling out Pokemon in the area I think (101:19 - 101:24)
that&#39;s great I yeah I it would be it (101:20 - 101:26)
would be more weird if we were all on (101:24 - 101:28)
different teams and not pushing each (101:26 - 101:32)
other a little bit right exactly I think (101:28 - 101:34)
that that that rivalry really does kind (101:32 - 101:37)
of encapsulate what Pokemon is about (101:34 - 101:39)
it&#39;s good to have Rivals that might be (101:37 - 101:42)
on a different side than you throughout (101:39 - 101:44)
the game I mean you see rivals in the (101:42 - 101:48)
Pokemon series over many years and you (101:44 - 101:50)
know they&#39;re usually rather defined and (101:48 - 101:52)
sometimes your Rivals are your friends (101:50 - 101:54)
sometimes they&#39;re just total utter jerks (101:52 - 101:58)
like silver from golden silver or (101:54 - 101:59)
question mark question mark question (101:58 - 102:01)
mark if you actually thought that was (101:59 - 102:04)
his name that was me that was you I know (102:01 - 102:07)
some people actually did think that and (102:04 - 102:09)
it&#39;s kind of funny but I thought they (102:07 - 102:11)
were going to reveal the name at the end (102:09 - 102:13)
so you just said his name was question (102:11 - 102:16)
mark question mark question oh fair (102:13 - 102:18)
enough oh yeah but I was leading up to (102:16 - 102:20)
this big twist at the end you finally (102:18 - 102:21)
figure out who he (102:20 - 102:25)
is he was a jerk though but he was also (102:21 - 102:27)
a rival I mean let&#39;s face it he&#39;d (102:25 - 102:30)
probably be on team Valor oh I&#39;m just (102:27 - 102:33)
kidding I&#39;m just kidding but it is (102:30 - 102:35)
interesting because some of the games (102:33 - 102:37)
you can kind of tell you&#39;re all on the (102:35 - 102:40)
same team whereas some of them you can (102:37 - 102:42)
definitely tell that yeah you&#39;re on very (102:40 - 102:44)
different teams like I guess I would (102:42 - 102:46)
think Diamond pearl and platinum you (102:44 - 102:48)
think of your rival Barry and if you (102:46 - 102:50)
were if you were to equate this to (102:48 - 102:54)
Pokemon go you&#39;d probably be on well any (102:50 - 102:55)
of the three teams and he&#39;d be on a (102:54 - 102:58)
different one and then maybe Dawn or (102:55 - 103:01)
Lucas would be on the same team as you (102:58 - 103:04)
or maybe an entirely separate team like (103:01 - 103:07)
team instinct or something sure yeah you (103:04 - 103:09)
can see those connections it&#39;s neat to (103:07 - 103:11)
think of it that now you kind of have (103:09 - 103:12)
rivals in the real (103:11 - 103:18)
world do you personally enjoy the game (103:12 - 103:21)
as as for what it is or do you think (103:18 - 103:24)
that the the if there wasn&#39;t the Pokemon (103:21 - 103:26)
aspect to it it would be something that (103:24 - 103:31)
was passable to you um I think I do (103:26 - 103:34)
enjoy the concept even regardless of the (103:31 - 103:37)
Pokemon but I think if it weren&#39;t (103:34 - 103:38)
Pokemon related it&#39;s probably something (103:37 - 103:41)
that wouldn&#39;t interest me as much just (103:38 - 103:44)
because I&#39;m not one that enjoys going (103:41 - 103:45)
out and you know meeting a whole bunch (103:44 - 103:47)
of people unless it&#39;s at like a Pokemon (103:45 - 103:50)
convention uh where of course I feel at (103:47 - 103:51)
home and I think that&#39;s going to be a (103:50 - 103:56)
lot of fun for like worlds stuff but I (103:51 - 103:58)
don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s simplistic right (103:56 - 104:02)
now but they have kind of alluded to (103:58 - 104:04)
there being a whole bunch of updates in (104:02 - 104:05)
the future like they&#39;re going to be (104:04 - 104:07)
adding trading they&#39;re going to be (104:05 - 104:09)
adding more generations and I think that (104:07 - 104:12)
what we see right now is just a start of (104:09 - 104:15)
something that&#39;ll just be revolutionary (104:12 - 104:18)
yeah hopefully you see you see a lot of (104:15 - 104:19)
those games that sit in the top charts (104:18 - 104:22)
like Candy Crush clash of Clash of Clans (104:19 - 104:24)
Clash Royale and the the thing those (104:22 - 104:27)
games all have in common are the guy (104:24 - 104:28)
screaming the guy (104:27 - 104:30)
screaming the thing they all have in (104:28 - 104:33)
common is they put out updates at least (104:30 - 104:36)
every two weeks like they are constantly (104:33 - 104:39)
updating their game and so yeah (104:36 - 104:42)
hopefully Pokémon go fits that because I (104:39 - 104:44)
I haven&#39;t played in a week just because (104:42 - 104:45)
the weather here it&#39;s been either too (104:44 - 104:48)
way too hot to go outside I have a limit (104:45 - 104:51)
yep or that limit has been reached it&#39;s (104:48 - 104:53)
been very hot lately and or or it was (104:51 - 104:56)
rainy before that so I haven&#39;t played in (104:53 - 104:59)
a week I you know I check at home I (104:56 - 105:00)
check at work and it&#39;s fine it&#39;s kind of (104:59 - 105:04)
the same Pokemon but I I worry that for (105:00 - 105:06)
the people who are playing a lot there&#39;s (105:04 - 105:09)
there&#39;s not they might burn through it (105:06 - 105:12)
and and some people might enjoy that or (105:09 - 105:13)
just be okay with it I&#39;m going to play (105:12 - 105:15)
it very heavily for 2 weeks and not (105:13 - 105:18)
touch it again but to keep that momentum (105:15 - 105:20)
which I want to see I want that momentum (105:18 - 105:22)
to stay that Pokemon is everywhere and (105:20 - 105:24)
it it&#39;s (105:22 - 105:25)
easy to go up to somebody and see what (105:24 - 105:27)
they&#39;re doing talk to them I hope that (105:25 - 105:30)
these updates are coming frequently and (105:27 - 105:32)
consistently just for the sake of the (105:30 - 105:34)
game and the community oh definitely in (105:32 - 105:36)
fact actually that does pose a question (105:34 - 105:38)
because I was talking with one of my (105:36 - 105:40)
friends about this and we were thinking (105:38 - 105:42)
what would be a good release schedule (105:40 - 105:44)
for new generations of Pokemon like (105:42 - 105:47)
would it be every four months every 6 (105:44 - 105:50)
months every year every 3 months and (105:47 - 105:52)
what do you think would be an ideal (105:50 - 105:54)
amount of time to wait between releasing (105:52 - 105:56)
a new generation of Pokemon on Pokémon (105:54 - 106:00)
go I I would probably say five to six (105:56 - 106:03)
months if there were other updates in (106:00 - 106:05)
between yeah that&#39;s personally that&#39;s (106:03 - 106:06)
kind of what I think as well I think (106:05 - 106:08)
like six months is just right my friend (106:06 - 106:11)
was arguing that no it needs to be four (106:08 - 106:13)
people will get they&#39;ll lose interest (106:11 - 106:15)
after you know six months of not having (106:13 - 106:17)
something but I I agree with you if they (106:15 - 106:21)
had more updates Beyond just you know (106:17 - 106:22)
new (106:21 - 106:24)
generations that it&#39;d be fine and that (106:22 - 106:26)
way you&#39;d have several years worth of (106:24 - 106:29)
updates whereas my fear is if you burn (106:26 - 106:32)
through all the generations too quickly (106:29 - 106:34)
then once you&#39;re done with them what (106:32 - 106:36)
more can you add really yeah yeah like (106:34 - 106:39)
maybe you add shinies to the game oh (106:36 - 106:41)
that would be neat oh my goodness just (106:39 - 106:44)
imagine people shouting shiny pigeon and (106:41 - 106:47)
everyone just runs over to try to get it (106:44 - 106:50)
yeah you know I don&#39;t I I would think it (106:47 - 106:53)
would not be smart to release more (106:50 - 106:56)
Pokemon and Pokémon go closer to Sun and (106:53 - 106:59)
Moon yeah I don&#39;t think that would be a (106:56 - 107:03)
good move uh you actually maybe that&#39;d (106:59 - 107:05)
be a great time for it because it gets (107:03 - 107:07)
people talking about Pokemon again yeah (107:05 - 107:10)
even if it&#39;s not sun and moon it&#39;s still (107:07 - 107:12)
Pokemon and then people might just think (107:10 - 107:13)
oh wow they made new Pokemon in Pokemon (107:12 - 107:15)
go maybe I should get the new Pokemon (107:13 - 107:18)
game that&#39;s coming out right or maybe (107:15 - 107:20)
not I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s weird I&#39;ll be (107:18 - 107:21)
curious to see if it&#39;s actually going to (107:20 - 107:24)
be competing with sun and moon or if it (107:21 - 107:27)
will just totally help its sales well do (107:24 - 107:30)
you think they should do generation 2 (107:27 - 107:31)
next or do you think they should do the (107:30 - 107:35)
newest generation to then show people (107:31 - 107:38)
these new Pokemon and go hey there&#39;s a (107:35 - 107:41)
game for that right now I hadn&#39;t even (107:38 - 107:43)
thought about that as a possibility I (107:41 - 107:46)
doubt they&#39;ll go that route just because (107:43 - 107:48)
that&#39;d be very confusing to a lot of (107:46 - 107:52)
people but I I I personally think that (107:48 - 107:53)
they&#39;ll release generation two before (107:52 - 107:56)
Generation 7 on go right right that is a (107:53 - 107:58)
possibility you never know they might (107:56 - 108:00)
decide to tie it in with that or maybe (107:58 - 108:03)
throw in a few Pokemon from gen 7 yeah (108:00 - 108:05)
just to really mess with people just (108:03 - 108:07)
maybe the starters or something yeah (108:05 - 108:09)
that could be cool I don&#39;t think a lot (108:07 - 108:11)
of people thought about this and (108:09 - 108:13)
technically only half of the United (108:11 - 108:15)
States has to worry about it but what (108:13 - 108:19)
happens to Pokémon go when it becomes (108:15 - 108:23)
winter oh man yeah that&#39;s uh (108:19 - 108:25)
that&#39;s G to get pretty cold we&#39;re both (108:23 - 108:28)
in trouble here yeah Wisconsin winners (108:25 - 108:30)
are not exactly the uh most fun thing in (108:28 - 108:33)
the world yeah no they&#39;re not good at (108:30 - 108:36)
all yeah hopefully they&#39;ll have I don&#39;t (108:33 - 108:38)
know maybe maybe they&#39;ll let Pokemon (108:36 - 108:40)
come to your houses a little bit more (108:38 - 108:43)
frequently or have some like daily event (108:40 - 108:44)
or something I know oftentimes a lot of (108:43 - 108:47)
free-to-play games will have something (108:44 - 108:48)
that you know you just sign in and you (108:47 - 108:50)
get something like maybe you could have (108:48 - 108:52)
a chance to fight a wild Pokemon then or (108:50 - 108:55)
they they give you like a free uh (108:52 - 108:57)
incense not a lure module but just an (108:55 - 109:00)
incense sure yeah something something or (108:57 - 109:02)
or maybe that that&#39;s the time where they (109:00 - 109:03)
partner with (109:02 - 109:06)
malls oh yeah I think they were talking (109:03 - 109:08)
about partnering with McDonald&#39;s and (109:06 - 109:10)
that sounds just wild yeah I&#39;ve heard (109:08 - 109:13)
rumors of GameStop too with the archus (109:10 - 109:16)
event coming up but yeah malls would be (109:13 - 109:19)
great yeah I think people in there both (109:16 - 109:21)
those are great and and Pokemon company (109:19 - 109:23)
has partnered with Ms before we saw that (109:21 - 109:26)
with the black and white tour oh yeah (109:23 - 109:29)
that went through so yeah I I mean like (109:26 - 109:30)
I said it&#39;s only half the states that (109:29 - 109:32)
have to worry about it but that&#39;s a lot (109:30 - 109:34)
of people that probably don&#39;t want to go (109:32 - 109:36)
outside and freezing cold to continue (109:34 - 109:38)
playing this game oh yeah but there are (109:36 - 109:40)
a lot of people that would and they&#39;re (109:38 - 109:42)
going to invest in those gloves that let (109:40 - 109:44)
you touch the uh your phone through the (109:42 - 109:47)
gloves or have little finger holes or (109:44 - 109:49)
something cuz that&#39;s the downside in (109:47 - 109:51)
winter you know you can&#39;t just touch (109:49 - 109:54)
your phone with gloves or a mitten or (109:51 - 109:55)
something on it it just doesn&#39;t work (109:54 - 109:58)
that way so people will get frostbite on (109:55 - 110:00)
their fingers and I guess Pokemon should (109:58 - 110:02)
really started thinking about that or (110:00 - 110:06)
Niantic or whoever is developing that (110:02 - 110:08)
feature or would be responsible for that (110:06 - 110:10)
because that is a legitimate concern I (110:08 - 110:11)
can just imagine all these kids getting (110:10 - 110:14)
frostbite from playing go without (110:11 - 110:16)
wearing gloves and that&#39;s definitely a (110:14 - 110:19)
concern right yeah absolutely well I (110:16 - 110:21)
told you I would only keep you here for (110:19 - 110:23)
an hour and we&#39;re approaching that now (110:21 - 110:26)
oh wow time FES and are having fun yeah (110:23 - 110:27)
no I thought it was a great conversation (110:26 - 110:29)
we covered a lot a lot of we did we (110:27 - 110:31)
totally did it was a lot of fun a lot of (110:29 - 110:34)
ground so hit all the bases you know (110:31 - 110:36)
that&#39;s that&#39;s what we try to do here oh (110:34 - 110:40)
yeah where can our listeners find you (110:36 - 110:43)

a million years ago yeah we had you (111:14 - 111:18)
request Pokemon of the week which was (111:16 - 111:22)
Merill oh yes we can&#39;t have that we (111:18 - 111:23)
can&#39;t have that happen again (111:22 - 111:26)
no no more merils no more merils but I I (111:23 - 111:28)
do have a Pokemon of the week all right (111:26 - 111:30)
idea that I think would be cool it&#39;s one (111:28 - 111:32)
of my favorite Pokemon it&#39;s a new (111:30 - 111:35)
Pokemon from Gen 6 so I guess it isn&#39;t (111:32 - 111:37)
really new anymore darn it but it&#39;s (111:35 - 111:40)
still new to me gosh darn it so yeah my (111:37 - 111:43)
Pokemon of the week suggestion would be (111:40 - 111:45)
meow stick I love meow stick it&#39;s just (111:43 - 111:48)
such a cool psychic cat Pokémon there&#39;s (111:45 - 111:50)
a different form for both male and (111:48 - 111:52)
female and depending on whether you have (111:50 - 111:54)
a male meow stick or a female meow stick (111:52 - 111:56)
they learn different level up moves (111:54 - 111:58)
which I think is really neat plus they (111:56 - 112:00)
just have a cool design they are cool (111:58 - 112:02)
are you you&#39;re a cat you&#39;re a cat guy (112:00 - 112:04)

enjoyed the interview with Maryland he&#39;s (113:07 - 113:11)
a great guy to sit down with before we (113:09 - 113:13)
get to our Pokemon of the week we&#39;re (113:11 - 113:16)
bringing back Healthy (113:13 - 113:20)
Living oh dang I&#39;m not prepared for this (113:16 - 113:23)
I&#39;ve been I just ate six donuts (113:20 - 113:26)
yeah I had uh I had chil dogs for lunch (113:23 - 113:29)
so I&#39;m I&#39;m certainly not the one to talk (113:26 - 113:31)
to I&#39;m actually lying I had three pieces (113:29 - 113:33)
of fried chicken and only four Donuts (113:31 - 113:36)
I&#39;m back on the water kick I got a you (113:33 - 113:38)
know those Amazon Dash buttons where you (113:36 - 113:41)
can press them and order stuff yes sir I (113:38 - 113:44)
have one for for Fiji Water and I have (113:41 - 113:45)
one for Smart Water because they&#39;re my (113:44 - 113:48)
two favorite Waters you can&#39;t do Fiji (113:45 - 113:50)
Water I can&#39;t why not that destroys the (113:48 - 113:53)
Earth cool Square bottle yeah yeah but (113:50 - 113:56)
the amount of like carbon footprint to (113:53 - 113:59)
get the water from Fiji to you far (113:56 - 114:01)
exceeds any benefit you&#39;re doing for the (113:59 - 114:03)
planet no you got to do locally sourced (114:01 - 114:06)
water that Lake Michigan water I don&#39;t (114:03 - 114:09)
think anyone needs to do Lake Michigan (114:06 - 114:13)
water even Travis knows that what Lake (114:09 - 114:15)
Michigan water is is good it is fresh (114:13 - 114:18)
and it is water uh tap water is also (114:15 - 114:22)
good you see I don&#39;t I can&#39;t do the tap (114:18 - 114:24)
water and I&#39;ll probably get a lot of (114:22 - 114:26)
hate for that then get one of the get (114:24 - 114:28)
one of the filters or whatever no you (114:26 - 114:29)
don&#39;t need the filter in Milwaukee (114:28 - 114:30)
Milwaukee is like rated like number (114:29 - 114:32)
three in like all of Wisconsin of having (114:30 - 114:34)
the best top tap water I think there are (114:32 - 114:36)
only like two other cities that have (114:34 - 114:38)
better tap water than Milwaukee because (114:36 - 114:41)
we have you drink it one of the quote (114:38 - 114:43)
unquote best filtration systems in the (114:41 - 114:48)
world I think it&#39;s the whole so I I (114:43 - 114:51)
clean my kitchen weekly I load the the (114:48 - 114:53)
dishwasher or (114:51 - 114:56)
you know do the dishes and when I load (114:53 - 114:57)
the (114:56 - 115:01)
dishwasher I am loading about 20 or so (114:57 - 115:04)
cups in the top rack and I noticed (115:01 - 115:05)
because I&#39;ve been doing this for you (115:04 - 115:08)
know several years that none of those (115:05 - 115:14)
cups are mine ever ever and so I think (115:08 - 115:16)
that has something to do with it where (115:14 - 115:19)
there&#39;s something satisfying to me about (115:16 - 115:22)
like cracking open a can or opening a (115:19 - 115:27)
bottle and just having that that liquid (115:22 - 115:29)
in a sealed container that makes me feel (115:27 - 115:32)
good so you&#39;ve been (115:29 - 115:35)
completely conditioned by the (115:32 - 115:38)
consumerist Disturbia in which you live (115:35 - 115:41)
that it&#39;s Travis it&#39;s worse than that he (115:38 - 115:45)
was never weaned from the bottle yeah he (115:41 - 115:48)
went right from baby bottles to Dr (115:45 - 115:50)
Pepper bottles there was a good there (115:48 - 115:52)
was a good Thread about people (115:50 - 115:54)
complaining about bottle water and how (115:52 - 115:56)
you could just drink tap water and how (115:54 - 115:59)
bottle water is a waste of money but (115:56 - 116:02)
technically it&#39;s not and this is getting (115:59 - 116:04)
this is getting a little Advanced (116:02 - 116:07)
because bottle water is competing with (116:04 - 116:10)
other bottled beverages is it not if I (116:07 - 116:13)
go into a gas station and I see a bottle (116:10 - 116:16)
of Dr Pepper and I see a bottle of water (116:13 - 116:19)
while yes I could get free water from a (116:16 - 116:24)
tap if I buy a119 bottle of water I am (116:19 - 116:27)
not buying (116:24 - 116:32)
a119 soft drink which means that soda (116:27 - 116:34)
company is not getting my money but (116:32 - 116:36)
instead a water company a soda company (116:34 - 116:38)
is still getting your money because like (116:36 - 116:40)
Coke owns Aquafina or whatever maybe (116:38 - 116:42)
Coke owns danani it&#39;s still still the (116:40 - 116:44)
same yeah it&#39;s still the same company (116:42 - 116:45)
that ends up getting your money well I (116:44 - 116:48)
don&#39;t buy danani I buy Fiji and smartw (116:45 - 116:51)
water so some other exploitative company (116:48 - 116:54)
that probably Tak makes the local water (116:51 - 116:58)
supply from from like a a developing (116:54 - 117:01)
country forcing people out of jobs (116:58 - 117:03)
you&#39;re supporting them instead yeah I&#39;m (117:01 - 117:05)
pretty people have (117:03 - 117:07)
jobs there there are somebody at a (117:05 - 117:10)
facility bottling said water I don&#39;t (117:07 - 117:12)
know the specifics of of Fiji and the (117:10 - 117:16)
Smart Water you describe but I but but I (117:12 - 117:20)
would guess that if I so if if you have (117:16 - 117:23)
a problem supporting Coke or Pepsi I (117:20 - 117:25)
would venture to Guess that the whatever (117:23 - 117:27)
whatever it is that you would have (117:25 - 117:28)
against those corporations and there are (117:27 - 117:30)
certain certainly complaints that could (117:28 - 117:32)
be made I would guarantee you that the (117:30 - 117:33)
same complaints could be made about (117:32 - 117:34)
whatever other companies you&#39;re (117:33 - 117:36)
supporting I I wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;m (117:34 - 117:38)
against supporting Coke or Pepsi I&#39;m (117:36 - 117:43)
just saying that there is still value in (117:38 - 117:46)
shelf space because if I&#39;m giving my (117:43 - 117:49)
money to a bottle of water on the shelf (117:46 - 117:53)
that means another beverage cannot get (117:49 - 117:55)
that shelf space so there is value there (117:53 - 117:57)
and what is like a good what another (117:55 - 118:00)
horrible horrible beverage that&#39;s coming (117:57 - 118:02)
to take your soul can&#39;t get on the Shelf (118:00 - 118:05)
cuz water is there can we get to some (118:02 - 118:08)
place that we all agree on water is good (118:05 - 118:10)
it is good to drink water and I want (118:08 - 118:12)
more water in my life so if my if my (118:10 - 118:15)
commitment to water is (118:12 - 118:19)
to have a 24 pack shipped to my house (118:15 - 118:21)
and if the difference is instead of (118:19 - 118:22)
picking up a can of soda I&#39;m going to to (118:21 - 118:25)
pick up this bottle of water then I&#39;ve (118:22 - 118:28)
made the right decisions you have made a (118:25 - 118:30)
less wrong decision you have made a (118:28 - 118:32)
decision that is better for you and (118:30 - 118:34)
probably has the same impact on the (118:32 - 118:35)
world around (118:34 - 118:37)
you right thank you for that accurate (118:35 - 118:39)
evaluation this is extremely accurate I (118:37 - 118:41)
mean either path I&#39;m going I&#39;m going (118:39 - 118:43)
down I&#39;m still screwing over other (118:41 - 118:45)
people but the difference is I&#39;m not (118:43 - 118:48)
screwing over myself well but maybe my (118:45 - 118:50)
wallet but that money is no good in the (118:48 - 118:53)
bank that is true you all are also doing (118:50 - 118:56)
but I mean you could always buy a um (118:53 - 118:58)
what are those bottles called that we (118:56 - 119:02)
use to drink water out of um uh cam cam (118:58 - 119:04)
back well that&#39;s the brand name but I (119:02 - 119:08)
meant a n jeene Bottle yeah you can (119:04 - 119:09)
always get a nenee because that&#39;s the (119:08 - 119:11)
same as cracking open a bottle top to (119:09 - 119:13)
drink your water out of it I don&#39;t know (119:11 - 119:16)
what this is just a plastic bottle like (119:13 - 119:18)
uh like a hard hard plastic bottle that (119:16 - 119:20)
tend to be pretty wide so they can hold (119:18 - 119:22)
a lot of water that you just fill up and (119:20 - 119:24)
then you carry it with it&#39;s just like a (119:22 - 119:27)
a water bottle as opposed to a bottled (119:24 - 119:28)
water which seems like they would be (119:27 - 119:30)
both the same thing but they are clearly (119:28 - 119:34)
not I&#39;ve gone down the water bottle path (119:30 - 119:35)
of and that&#39;s so much better than (119:34 - 119:38)
bottled water it&#39;s not I&#39;m just not (119:35 - 119:40)
satisfied ever so do wait do you have (119:38 - 119:42)
extra water bottles that you can bring (119:40 - 119:44)
to Gen Con for me thank you yeah I have (119:42 - 119:45)
like a million water bottles because (119:44 - 119:46)
I&#39;ve like tried them all I&#39;ve tried like (119:45 - 119:48)
the cam back I&#39;ve tried the cam back (119:46 - 119:53)
with the filtration I&#39;ve tried the smart (119:48 - 119:54)
water bottle that like reminds you every (119:53 - 119:56)
hour that you should take a drink I&#39;ve (119:54 - 119:59)
tried all those and what has worked the (119:56 - 120:02)
best for me is just a bottle of water at (119:59 - 120:04)
room temperature by the way because (120:02 - 120:06)
agreed because when I&#39;m done with the (120:04 - 120:09)
bottle I have it&#39;s almost like a game (120:06 - 120:13)
where this is the level that I need to (120:09 - 120:15)
complete and when I finish the bottle I (120:13 - 120:16)
have completed the (120:15 - 120:19)
level I agree with you on the room (120:16 - 120:20)
temperature thing I always find I drink (120:19 - 120:24)
more water when it&#39;s not very cold but (120:20 - 120:28)
gosh the it you sound like a side (120:24 - 120:30)
character in a dystopia who&#39;s like you (120:28 - 120:34)
know I like I I like drinking water but (120:30 - 120:36)
without the marketing it&#39;s just not the (120:34 - 120:39)
same it&#39;s not as delicious well here&#39;s (120:36 - 120:41)
here&#39;s something that will blow Steve&#39;s (120:39 - 120:44)
mind Beyond it&#39;s going to blow it into (120:41 - 120:45)
the Next Room bot bottled water is just (120:44 - 120:50)
tap water no and I&#39;ll I&#39;ll even use your (120:45 - 120:53)
uh colloquial term for it so he&#39;ll (120:50 - 120:56)
clearly understand you can buy a bubbler (120:53 - 120:58)
for your house uh that&#39;s what the (120:56 - 121:00)
Wisconsin people call it I&#39;ve never (120:58 - 121:01)
called it a bubbler I always called it a (121:00 - 121:03)
drinking fountain or a water fountain (121:01 - 121:06)
are you not a Wisconsin person I am but (121:03 - 121:10)
I I never subscribed to the bubbler term (121:06 - 121:12)
th those of us in the real world call it (121:10 - 121:14)
a water cooler I&#39;ve never heard a (121:12 - 121:16)
drinking fountain or a water fountain (121:14 - 121:18)
probably drinking fountain no no no a (121:16 - 121:20)
water cooler where you get the huge (121:18 - 121:23)
bottles of water delivered to to you oh (121:20 - 121:26)
one of those that&#39;s not that&#39;s not what (121:23 - 121:28)
Wisconsin people would call a bubbler (121:26 - 121:30)
are you sure no they would call person (121:28 - 121:33)
called with a one that you twist and (121:30 - 121:35)
that sprays in the air they would call (121:33 - 121:36)
that a bubbler but they would also call (121:35 - 121:38)
a water cooler a bubbler because it (121:36 - 121:40)
makes the bubble sounds like (121:38 - 121:43)
the Y wait so what are you oh you&#39;re (121:40 - 121:47)
talking about like a like the water cool (121:43 - 121:49)
like the like like an office water (121:47 - 121:53)
cooler okay I hate the water cooler I (121:49 - 121:55)
hate everything about it my work got rid (121:53 - 121:58)
of our bottled water we used to have a (121:55 - 122:00)
fridge full of bottled water and what I (121:58 - 122:01)
would do is I would go to the fridge I (122:00 - 122:03)
would take three bottles of water out I (122:01 - 122:04)
would set them on my desk and then the (122:03 - 122:08)
next day they would be room temperature (122:04 - 122:09)
and they that&#39;s why they got rid of the (122:08 - 122:11)
bottled water cuz you were drinking it (122:09 - 122:14)
all and then they got rid of it to save (122:11 - 122:15)
money and they brought they were like (122:14 - 122:18)
well we have the water cooler and the (122:15 - 122:20)
first time I went to the water cooler I (122:18 - 122:23)
went to like fill my cup up and then I (122:20 - 122:25)
noticed that it was dirty and I threw it (122:23 - 122:27)
all away I was like never again am I (122:25 - 122:29)
going to the water cooler this is too (122:27 - 122:31)
dirty for me and I walked over to the (122:29 - 122:35)
Piggly Wiggly which is a dying grocery (122:31 - 122:38)
grocery store chain in Wisconsin I (122:35 - 122:39)
walked over the has an amazing Name by (122:38 - 122:41)
the way I love Piggly Wiggly it does (122:39 - 122:44)
have a good name and I bought a six-pack (122:41 - 122:47)
of smart water for like $7 cuz smart (122:44 - 122:49)
water&#39;s way overpriced and I walked back (122:47 - 122:51)
and I was satisfied I like to imagine (122:49 - 122:53)
you went up to the water cooler you (122:51 - 122:55)
filled up your cup and you reach like (122:53 - 122:57)
above the cup where the cap would have (122:55 - 122:59)
been to turn it and you like turn your (122:57 - 123:01)
hand and then you look quizzically at (122:59 - 123:04)
the water and then you sigh and you just (123:01 - 123:06)
dump it out on the floor the real the (123:04 - 123:09)
real flaw in his story is that the Cup (123:06 - 123:12)
being dirty was his own fault it goes (123:09 - 123:15)
back to the loading the dishwasher and I (123:12 - 123:17)
just don&#39;t care about there&#39;s something (123:15 - 123:21)
about like the the so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not (123:17 - 123:23)
about it&#39;s not (123:21 - 123:25)
it&#39;s not about the (123:23 - 123:29)
satis satisfaction of of opening up a (123:25 - 123:31)
bottle of water or what have you which (123:29 - 123:34)
is ludicrous to begin with it&#39;s about (123:31 - 123:35)
you don&#39;t want to do (123:34 - 123:38)
dishes I you know the loading a (123:35 - 123:40)
dishwasher and unloading a dishwasher is (123:38 - 123:42)
easy (123:40 - 123:47)
correct it it&#39;s I&#39;m a I&#39;m a mess well at (123:42 - 123:49)
least you know it uh our Pokemon of the (123:47 - 123:53)
week is meow stic the not a water type (123:49 - 123:54)
cat (123:53 - 123:57)
Pokemon oh the (123:54 - 124:00)
constrainted Pokemon there we go sorry I (123:57 - 124:03)
didn&#39;t have have the window (124:00 - 124:03)
open uh meow (124:03 - 124:07)
stick appears drastically different (124:05 - 124:10)
between genders but in either form it is (124:07 - 124:14)
a bipedal feline Pokemon with a (124:10 - 124:17)
humanlike posture digital appendages and (124:14 - 124:20)
two tails the male&#39;s fur is (124:17 - 124:23)
predominantly dark blue with accents of (124:20 - 124:25)
white and the female&#39;s color scheme is (124:23 - 124:29)
reversed the male ears are mostly blue (124:25 - 124:30)
you guys know what metic looks like it&#39;s (124:29 - 124:33)
a cat that stands up it&#39;s psychic it is (124:30 - 124:40)
678 in the Pokedex 50% female 50% male (124:33 - 124:43)
Travis has a move set uh but before he (124:40 - 124:44)
break got two of them for you two of (124:43 - 124:46)
them and why he has two of them I didn&#39;t (124:44 - 124:49)
know this but uh the male and the female (124:46 - 124:52)
both have different hidden abilities so (124:49 - 124:54)
they both can have keen ey or (124:52 - 124:56)
infiltrator but the male can have (124:54 - 124:58)
prankster and the female can have (124:56 - 125:00)
competitive as their hidden abilities so (124:58 - 125:03)
and equally equally important the move (125:00 - 125:05)
pools of the male form and female form (125:03 - 125:07)
are different the male has more (125:05 - 125:08)
defensive moves and the female is more (125:07 - 125:11)
offensive ones there which complements (125:08 - 125:12)
their hidden abilities like prankster is (125:11 - 125:15)
a better supportive ability for example (125:12 - 125:17)
so what what to translate what Travis (125:15 - 125:19)
just said is the male and the female (125:17 - 125:22)
metic learn different moves during level (125:19 - 125:24)
up completely different well they have (125:22 - 125:27)
some overlap but most different move yes (125:24 - 125:30)
that is all right would you say that (125:27 - 125:34)
Meowstic is the tap water and the male (125:30 - 125:36)
meow is the tap water and the female is (125:34 - 125:40)
the bottled water no okay got that out (125:36 - 125:43)
of the way all right what&#39;s your what&#39;s (125:40 - 125:46)
our move sets here so we&#39;ll start with (125:43 - 125:48)
uh the female meos stick um and we&#39;re (125:46 - 125:51)
going to do the hidden abilities for (125:48 - 125:52)
both so that&#39;s comp competitive for (125:51 - 125:54)
female meow stick and prankster for male (125:52 - 125:56)
meow stick there is also something to be (125:54 - 125:59)
said for uh an infiltrator set CU (125:56 - 126:00)
infiltrator is a great ability for (125:59 - 126:02)
getting past substitutes light screens (126:00 - 126:05)
reflects and Safeguard I think is the (126:02 - 126:06)
other thing infiltrator Gets You Through (126:05 - 126:09)
but no one&#39;s using Safeguard um there is (126:06 - 126:11)
nothing to be said for a keen ey set so (126:09 - 126:15)
don&#39;t do that um competitive for those (126:11 - 126:19)
unaware is an ability where if that (126:15 - 126:21)
Pokemon&#39;s any of that Pokemon stats (126:19 - 126:22)
would be lowered (126:21 - 126:25)
then its special attack raises by two (126:22 - 126:26)
stages so even if its special attack (126:25 - 126:29)
gets lowered by one it&#39;ll be raised by (126:26 - 126:32)
two and it ends up being a net gain of (126:29 - 126:36)
one stage which is I don&#39;t remember the (126:32 - 126:37)
exact numbers on how much one stage (126:36 - 126:40)
equates but you can look it up so for (126:37 - 126:43)
example if someone uses defog defog is a (126:40 - 126:46)
commonly used move where the opponent&#39;s (126:43 - 126:50)
evasion is lowered and all the entry (126:46 - 126:52)
hazards are taken away so lot of people (126:50 - 126:54)
use defog because it gets rid of Stealth (126:52 - 126:57)
Rock spikes toxic spikes sticky web but (126:54 - 126:59)
it also reduces the opponent&#39;s evasion (126:57 - 127:01)
which in this case uh if you&#39;re playing (126:59 - 127:04)
meow stic female meow STI with (127:01 - 127:07)
competitive would the reduction in (127:04 - 127:08)
evasion would still happen then meow (127:07 - 127:10)
stick special attack goes up by two and (127:08 - 127:12)
now you&#39;re dealing twice as much damage (127:10 - 127:16)
if my memory of stages um yeah it&#39;s (127:12 - 127:18)
something like that correct because of (127:16 - 127:21)
that we&#39;re going to be using a specially (127:18 - 127:24)
offensive set we&#39;re going to give you a (127:21 - 127:26)
timid nature which is the one that (127:24 - 127:28)
increases your speed and decreases your (127:26 - 127:30)
attack and then your EVS are going to be (127:28 - 127:34)
252 in special attack and speed um and (127:30 - 127:36)
then for fun instead of doing like a (127:34 - 127:37)
life orb set which would be the more (127:36 - 127:40)
common we&#39;re going to do a choice specs (127:37 - 127:44)
set and we&#39;re going to do psychic Shadow (127:40 - 127:47)
Ball Thunderbolt and trick the psychic (127:44 - 127:50)
Shadow Ball Thunderbolt are all just for (127:47 - 127:52)
um dealing damage and having coverage (127:50 - 127:54)
and then trick is there so that you (127:52 - 127:57)
would use trick in a circumstance where (127:54 - 127:59)
you would want to make an opponent&#39;s (127:57 - 128:03)
Pokemon less effective um so for example (127:59 - 128:04)
if you&#39;re running up against a Pokemon (128:03 - 128:07)
that uses all physically offensive moves (128:04 - 128:09)
you can use trick which gives your (128:07 - 128:11)
choice specs to them and you grab (128:09 - 128:14)
Whatever item they have now they have (128:11 - 128:15)
the disadvantage that choice specs (128:14 - 128:19)
imposes where you can only use the first (128:15 - 128:20)
move that you used when you switched (128:19 - 128:22)
that Pokemon in but it doesn&#39;t gain the (128:20 - 128:24)
advantage of the additional special (128:22 - 128:26)
attack because it&#39;s a physically (128:24 - 128:28)
attacking Pokemon so you can have that (128:26 - 128:31)
benefit out of it um I think that (128:28 - 128:34)
explains the female meiotic set it&#39;s (128:31 - 128:35)
more of a sweeper than well it&#39;s (128:34 - 128:36)
definitely more of a sweeper than a (128:35 - 128:38)
defensive Pokemon so you want to be (128:36 - 128:40)
careful with your switchins the only (128:38 - 128:42)
time you&#39;d want to really switch in a (128:40 - 128:45)
move is if you expect something like a (128:42 - 128:48)
defog that would reduce your stat so (128:45 - 128:50)
that it&#39;ll boost your special attack or (128:48 - 128:51)
if you think they&#39;re going to switch (128:50 - 128:53)
into like a GE gados or something with (128:51 - 128:54)
intimidate because that would also (128:53 - 128:57)
trigger competitive our set for maale (128:54 - 128:59)
meow STI is going to differ a lot (128:57 - 129:01)
because the move pool and and the (128:59 - 129:05)
prankster ability lead you to more of a (129:01 - 129:07)
supportive or defensive Direction (129:05 - 129:09)
prankster for those who don&#39;t know is an (129:07 - 129:11)
ability where if you use a move that (129:09 - 129:13)
doesn&#39;t deal damage to your opponent and (129:11 - 129:15)
that includes status effect moves like (129:13 - 129:18)
toxic or whatever then that move gets an (129:15 - 129:20)
increased priority like quick attack or (129:18 - 129:22)
something so um a Pokemon with frankster (129:20 - 129:24)
using Thunder Wave is going to go first (129:22 - 129:26)
over a Pokemon that&#39;s faster than it (129:24 - 129:28)
unless that Pokemon is also using a (129:26 - 129:31)
priority move so we&#39;re going to use both (129:28 - 129:34)
reflect and light screen um because dual (129:31 - 129:36)
screens can be very helpful for a team U (129:34 - 129:38)
because we&#39;re doing that we&#39;re going to (129:36 - 129:42)
put light Clay on our male Meo stick (129:38 - 129:43)
because that extends the length of those (129:42 - 129:46)
two moves reflect reduces the damage (129:43 - 129:48)
from physical moves and light screen (129:46 - 129:50)
reduces the damage from special moves (129:48 - 129:52)
and that continues even if you switch (129:50 - 129:54)
out of mil meow stick for the other two (129:52 - 129:56)
moves we&#39;re going to want at least a (129:54 - 129:58)
status effect because that&#39;s generally a (129:56 - 130:00)
good idea with a defensive Pokemon like (129:58 - 130:02)
this so that you can have prolonged (130:00 - 130:04)
effect even after the Pokemon dies (130:02 - 130:06)
unless they um use like a healing Bell (130:04 - 130:07)
or something so we&#39;re going to put (130:06 - 130:10)
Thunder Wave on there and then the final (130:07 - 130:12)
move is going to be psychic just so that (130:10 - 130:15)
you can deal some damage in a pinch the (130:12 - 130:18)
recommendation here that I&#39;m reading is (130:15 - 130:19)
bold nature and I don&#39;t remember which (130:18 - 130:22)
one that one is (130:19 - 130:25)
but then terrible Pokemon go update uh (130:22 - 130:28)
my nearby says Paris Pidgeotto Weedle (130:25 - 130:31)
venonat rata a bunch of other garbage (130:28 - 130:33)
Pokemon uh so Paris and Pidgeotto being (130:31 - 130:34)
first on the list a Weedle actually (130:33 - 130:37)
popped up so I don&#39;t think the uh the (130:34 - 130:40)
order of the list has much importance (130:37 - 130:43)
anymore but I will keep I will keep (130:40 - 130:46)
investigating back back to you (130:43 - 130:48)
meow and then for EES we&#39;re going to do (130:46 - 130:53)
252 in HP and defense and that&#39;s it (130:48 - 130:55)
that&#39;s it if you get a shiny meow stic (130:53 - 130:58)
it is a it is yellow and white instead (130:55 - 131:00)
of blue and white uh which is pretty (130:58 - 131:03)
cool it&#39;s like a like a golden yellow uh (131:00 - 131:05)
meti is the only Pokemon with a base (131:03 - 131:07)
stat total of (131:05 - 131:10)
466 how low is that Travis what is it (131:07 - 131:12)
people want like 500 dish what was the (131:10 - 131:13)
what was the stat in question I was (131:12 - 131:15)
looking at something else uh base stat (131:13 - 131:18)
total 466 it&#39;s not very good it&#39;s pretty (131:15 - 131:22)
low the speed is okay um and the special (131:18 - 131:27)
attack is uh workable um but generally (131:22 - 131:29)
you wouldn&#39;t run this on a very (131:27 - 131:31)
competitive team just because it doesn&#39;t (131:29 - 131:33)
have a lot of stats especially for like (131:31 - 131:35)
a defensive Pokemon like we&#39;re trying to (131:33 - 131:36)
make M meow stick into because it (131:35 - 131:38)
doesn&#39;t have the bulk to survive many (131:36 - 131:40)
hits I mean maybe with a light screen or (131:38 - 131:42)
reflect it could but unfortunately it (131:40 - 131:44)
doesn&#39;t have a very high base stat total (131:42 - 131:47)
you want something in at least the 500s (131:44 - 131:50)
generally got it yeah and uh bold nature (131:47 - 131:53)
increases defense decreases attack there (131:50 - 131:55)
you go sounds right uh mostic is the (131:53 - 131:57)
only Pokemon to have separate move sets (131:55 - 132:00)
for each gender some trivia for you and (131:57 - 132:03)
finally during Google&#39;s April fools (132:00 - 132:06)
event on 2014 metic had metic genders (132:03 - 132:07)
had separate deck numbers in the (132:06 - 132:11)
Google&#39;s Regional decks the male was 139 (132:07 - 132:14)
and the female was 140 yeah meows based (132:11 - 132:17)
on a cat if you guys didn&#39;t know that I (132:14 - 132:19)
don&#39;t believe it who would have guessed (132:17 - 132:20)
meow stick could be a combination of (132:19 - 132:25)
meow and Mystic so that tracks seems (132:20 - 132:26)
right that seems accurate there&#39;s metic (132:25 - 132:28)
that was maryn&#39;s Pokemon of the week (132:26 - 132:33)
pick he&#39;s a big meow stick fan as am I I (132:28 - 132:36)
uh I&#39;ve said that before that I enjoy (132:33 - 132:39)
the meow stick but I think uh I think (132:36 - 132:41)
that wraps up our show for you guys if (132:39 - 132:43)

us a review in iTunes uh we are at 617 (134:07 - 134:13)
reviews my goal for 2016 was to get to (134:10 - 134:15)
600 reviews but we passed that so I (134:13 - 134:19)
guess we have like five 6 months left in (134:15 - 134:21)
the year so let&#39;s try to get to 700 (134:19 - 134:23)
before the end of 2016 I think that (134:21 - 134:27)
would be that&#39;s a ambitious goal uh but (134:23 - 134:29)
I think it&#39;s doable I don&#39;t think I have (134:27 - 134:32)
anything else I will be at genan next (134:29 - 134:34)
week while I will be recording the live (134:32 - 134:36)
show I don&#39;t know if I will get it up in (134:34 - 134:38)
time so I might actually publish for (134:36 - 134:40)
everyone our Kickstarter exclusive show (134:38 - 134:45)
which is uh 3 hours of me Travis will (134:40 - 134:48)
and Micah debating about which 10 (134:45 - 134:50)
Pokémon are the best 10 Pokémon out of (134:48 - 134:52)
the current (134:50 - 134:56)
723 Pokémon things get very heated it (134:52 - 134:57)
was a good show though it was really (134:56 - 135:01)
really great mhm I sometimes think in (134:57 - 135:03)
bed or in the shower or while I&#39;m (135:01 - 135:06)
drinking a bottle of water that I wish (135:03 - 135:08)
there was more conflict more debate on (135:06 - 135:10)
it super effective and I feel like I (135:08 - 135:12)
felt like that Kickstarter show was (135:10 - 135:15)
exactly what I had the thirst for yeah (135:12 - 135:16)
it was great it was really good so I (135:15 - 135:19)
might publish that I did reach out to (135:16 - 135:21)
the the people who backed the kickstar (135:19 - 135:23)
originally and none of them uh really (135:21 - 135:26)
seemed opposed to uh well I would say (135:23 - 135:28)
none of them did seem opposed to uh (135:26 - 135:30)
providing it for everyone so that is (135:28 - 135:31)
probably something that will be (135:30 - 135:33)
published unless I have time to edit (135:31 - 135:36)
that live show I&#39;ll get that up to but (135:33 - 135:38)
