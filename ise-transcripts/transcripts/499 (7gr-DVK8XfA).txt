[Music] (0:02 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:26 - 0:32)
499th episode of the pokemon podcast (0:29 - 0:35)
it's super effective i'm your host sbj (0:32 - 0:38)
and with me is greg (0:35 - 0:40)
hello let's get through this i got some (0:38 - 0:43)
arceus to play (0:40 - 0:43)
i spent (0:44 - 0:47)
four hours using (0:48 - 0:53)
uh a certain streamers full proof (0:50 - 0:56)
shiny hunting technique (0:53 - 0:58)
last night it was up until one in the (0:56 - 1:01)
morning and it is not foolproof that is (0:58 - 1:02)
the tackle eyes (1:01 - 1:06)
50 50 greg it's either shinier it's not (1:02 - 1:09)
you keep rolling tails i guess (1:06 - 1:11)
it's i'm stuck in a roasted cranston (1:09 - 1:14)
guildenstern is like yeah like me trying (1:11 - 1:16)
to get that combi (1:14 - 1:17)
uh will also here (1:16 - 1:19)
i only stayed up till midnight watching (1:17 - 1:21)
bleach so (1:19 - 1:24)
my time was much better rewarded (1:21 - 1:26)
yeah that sounds cool i mean that is (1:24 - 1:28)
pretty good although (1:26 - 1:31)
where did i leave off in bleach (1:28 - 1:33)
i don't remember it's all on hulu the (1:31 - 1:35)
entire thing i know (1:33 - 1:37)
but i don't it's like when i try to jump (1:35 - 1:39)
back into one piece like i just realized (1:37 - 1:41)
i don't necessarily have that kind of (1:39 - 1:42)
time oh i started from the beginning (1:41 - 1:47)
again oh my gosh i can't i just can't (1:42 - 1:48)
hey uh (1:47 - 1:49)
so (1:48 - 1:53)
we had a spoiler episode on thursday i (1:49 - 1:55)
went all the way up to the for the most (1:53 - 1:56)
part the third area (1:55 - 1:58)
and we'll probably have another spoiler (1:56 - 2:01)
show this week talking up to (1:58 - 2:04)
the credits of the game (2:01 - 2:06)
um i think greg and i both got credits i (2:04 - 2:09)
got credits i don't know where will is i (2:06 - 2:10)
just (2:09 - 2:12)
unlocked the fourth area but i haven't (2:10 - 2:15)
gone there yet got it (2:12 - 2:17)
um (2:15 - 2:20)
so we won't be spoiling any (2:17 - 2:22)
arceus stuff we will be talking about it (2:20 - 2:23)
in the later half of the show just a (2:22 - 2:24)
little bit some more thoughts and (2:23 - 2:26)
feelings but we'll probably save any (2:24 - 2:27)
storyline (2:26 - 2:29)
kind of stuff for for that that bonus (2:27 - 2:30)
episode (2:29 - 2:33)
um we will though start off some pokemon (2:30 - 2:34)
news because there was a lot of news (2:33 - 2:36)
that happened in the last week uh let's (2:34 - 2:38)
start off with a real banger here (2:36 - 2:40)
uh (2:38 - 2:42)
this is off pokemon go live.com (2:40 - 2:45)
trainers we've been observing the (2:42 - 2:47)
situation in abu dhabi and our community (2:45 - 2:49)
with our community in mind we decided to (2:47 - 2:52)
cancel the pokemon go tour live event in (2:49 - 2:55)
abu dhabi on february 27th order refunds (2:52 - 2:57)
will be processed for the next two days (2:55 - 2:58)
several days for it to appear in your (2:57 - 3:00)
account uh we're disappointed we will (2:58 - 3:02)
not see you in abu dhabi (3:00 - 3:05)
but it will still take place in mexico (3:02 - 3:08)
and taiwan as scheduled that sounds like (3:05 - 3:10)
wishful thinking (3:08 - 3:13)
[Laughter] (3:10 - 3:16)
we're about 21 of what 21 (3:13 - 3:19)
days away from those two events (3:16 - 3:19)
yeah (3:21 - 3:24)
yeah (3:22 - 3:25)
um (3:24 - 3:28)
hopefully the people who booked their (3:25 - 3:30)
plane tickets can get those refunded i (3:28 - 3:32)
guess do you think people actually (3:30 - 3:35)
booked plane tickets to go to abu dhabi (3:32 - 3:37)
uh (3:35 - 3:38)
i would say there are probably a handful (3:37 - 3:40)
of very hardcore pokemon (3:38 - 3:44)
go people yes yeah i'd say more mexico (3:40 - 3:46)
though than abu dhabi are we allowed to (3:44 - 3:47)
travel (3:46 - 3:50)
outside of the us right yes yes (3:47 - 3:52)
there are no travel restrictions (3:50 - 3:54)
well what if you're like a hardcore (3:52 - 3:56)
italian player (3:54 - 3:59)
is it not easier to fly to abu dhabi (3:56 - 4:00)
than it would be anywhere else i mean (3:59 - 4:02)
it's shorter yeah right yeah it's (4:00 - 4:03)
shorter (4:02 - 4:07)
i don't know that's necessarily easier (4:03 - 4:10)
i mean flying is no longer uh (4:07 - 4:13)
fun or exciting or swanky (4:10 - 4:17)
um affair like it used to be (4:13 - 4:17)
yeah i mean like (4:18 - 4:22)
the pokemon go johto (4:20 - 4:25)
tour is the 26th that's coming up it's (4:22 - 4:26)
coming up real fast i feel like jeez (4:25 - 4:29)
we're already in february um (4:26 - 4:30)
and then (4:29 - 4:32)
the 27th is technically (4:30 - 4:34)
pokemon day (4:32 - 4:37)
is the day where uh red and green were (4:34 - 4:39)
originally released in japan (4:37 - 4:42)
so that's why this go-to thing is (4:39 - 4:45)
happening although the we said weeks ago (4:42 - 4:47)
that like having three locations none (4:45 - 4:49)
being not even a single one being in the (4:47 - 4:52)
us or japan is a little weird since (4:49 - 4:54)
the us and japan are the two biggest (4:52 - 4:59)
markets for that game that's okay uh (4:54 - 4:59)
i also (5:00 - 5:02)
i don't know if i've said this on the (5:02 - 5:04)
podcast where i was just saying it on my (5:02 - 5:05)
twitch streams if you look if you look (5:04 - 5:08)
at the calendar for february (5:05 - 5:09)
um (5:08 - 5:11)
i don't think there's going to be a (5:09 - 5:13)
pokemon day announcement on pokemon day (5:11 - 5:16)
because that's a sunday and i don't (5:13 - 5:17)
think they would also do it on a (5:16 - 5:18)
saturday because why would they do a (5:17 - 5:20)
huge announcement (5:18 - 5:21)
on a day where you're supposed to be (5:20 - 5:24)
playing eight hours in pogo (5:21 - 5:25)
and they probably wouldn't do it on a (5:24 - 5:28)
friday because friday in the us is is (5:25 - 5:29)
saturday in japan so that also doesn't (5:28 - 5:32)
make sense so the the realistically (5:29 - 5:34)
realistically the announcement possibly (5:32 - 5:35)
for pokemon day would probably be that (5:34 - 5:37)
thursday (5:35 - 5:38)
that thursday the 24th (5:37 - 5:41)
um which would be a friday in japan (5:38 - 5:42)
um (5:41 - 5:44)
and i would (5:42 - 5:45)
i would assume they would announce (5:44 - 5:47)
something i guess they could do with (5:45 - 5:50)
the monday the 20th but time doesn't (5:47 - 5:53)
mean that much anymore it could be on (5:50 - 5:55)
sunday we are talking about the same (5:53 - 5:57)
company that will load seven things up (5:55 - 5:59)
on a weekend (5:57 - 6:01)
no they always load it before the (5:59 - 6:02)
weekend (6:01 - 6:04)
no i mean like they they oh you mean (6:02 - 6:05)
they put everything i put everything on (6:04 - 6:08)
the weekend yeah you expect them to be (6:05 - 6:09)
like let's not make an announcement (6:08 - 6:12)
because everybody's busy like (6:09 - 6:12)
i don't remember a time where they've (6:13 - 6:16)
announced something on a saturday or (6:15 - 6:18)
sunday though it's always on like a (6:16 - 6:20)
thursday (6:18 - 6:23)
or a tuesday (6:20 - 6:23)
my assumption is it's going to be the (6:25 - 6:28)
24th of february (6:26 - 6:30)
they're gonna my assumptions it's gonna (6:28 - 6:31)
be in march (6:30 - 6:33)
they're gonna announce (6:31 - 6:37)
uh whatever games they want to whatever (6:33 - 6:39)
you know look if we say that pokemon (6:37 - 6:40)
sleep is coming in every pokemon (6:39 - 6:43)
announcement we will eventually be right (6:40 - 6:44)
and then we can say that we were right (6:43 - 6:47)
pokemon sleep the new pokemon ranger is (6:44 - 6:49)
gonna be announced (6:47 - 6:50)
hey you pikachu (6:49 - 6:53)
pokemon ranger pokemon pal park seven no (6:50 - 6:57)
one wants ranger pal parks excuse me (6:53 - 7:00)
i i have recently had the realization (6:57 - 7:02)
that like pokemon original pokemon (7:00 - 7:04)
ranger i actually like better than black (7:02 - 7:06)
and white (7:04 - 7:08)
like pokemon ranger original pokemon (7:06 - 7:10)
ranger is probably my favorite pokemon (7:08 - 7:11)
game (7:10 - 7:13)
wow 2022. wow (7:11 - 7:17)
the truths are coming out close that (7:13 - 7:20)
calendar there (7:17 - 7:20)
speaking of more pokemon go stuff (7:21 - 7:27)
uh this is also pokemongolive.com (7:24 - 7:31)
announcing the pokemon tcg pokemon go (7:27 - 7:32)
this is the name of the this is the (7:31 - 7:35)
actual name of the the the set it is (7:32 - 7:38)
called the pokemon tcg pokemon go (7:35 - 7:40)
expansion (7:38 - 7:40)
this summer a collaboration between the (7:40 - 7:44)
pokemon trading card game and pokemon go (7:42 - 7:45)
will be released (7:44 - 7:47)
uh the expansion will feature cards (7:45 - 7:49)
themed after the popular mobile game you (7:47 - 7:51)
can get an early look at the expansion (7:49 - 7:54)
package design below more details will (7:51 - 7:55)
be coming soon (7:54 - 8:00)
please be aware of your surroundings um (7:55 - 8:00)
for the audio listeners greg's faces in (8:03 - 8:10)
complete disarray apart from professor (8:07 - 8:13)
willow (8:10 - 8:13)
i think it add like stadium pokestop (8:13 - 8:19)
like i can't think like the pokemon art (8:16 - 8:21)
unique to pokemon go (8:19 - 8:23)
uh (8:21 - 8:26)
i mean you got spark you got (8:23 - 8:26)
you got (8:34 - 8:36)
uh (8:35 - 8:37)
incense (8:36 - 8:38)
you got (8:37 - 8:41)
all kinds of yeah so basically we're (8:38 - 8:43)
looking at items and trainer cards and (8:41 - 8:45)
baby stadium (8:43 - 8:47)
well yeah maybe a state on the packaging (8:45 - 8:49)
you see a larva tar pikachu mewtwo (8:47 - 8:54)
blissey gyarados um con kelder apam (8:49 - 8:56)
i can very much imagine that the pokemon (8:54 - 8:58)
cards will be (8:56 - 9:02)
art themed similar if you (8:58 - 9:05)
there's an instagram uh it's like pkmn (9:02 - 9:08)
snaps or something like that if you look (9:05 - 9:11)
at that i don't i it's just an instagram (9:08 - 9:14)
i follow but they do like pokemon from (9:11 - 9:18)
pokemon go in like real world settings (9:14 - 9:20)
i imagine the cards would have that type (9:18 - 9:24)
of art i would not be surprised if (9:20 - 9:25)
the pokemon company international (9:24 - 9:28)
contacted pokemon snaps and was like (9:25 - 9:31)
could you do the art for this tcg set (9:28 - 9:34)
it's a lot exclusive deal (9:31 - 9:36)
and we'll offer you one booster box (9:34 - 9:38)
exposure (9:36 - 9:40)
basically that's how they pay is when (9:38 - 9:43)
that's a contest for exposure (9:40 - 9:45)
um (9:43 - 9:47)
i i i'd wager to guess this set is (9:45 - 9:49)
probably gonna be like 60 cards (9:47 - 9:52)
or something i don't (9:49 - 9:53)
well i mean we already have the (9:52 - 9:55)
professor willow cards so we're ahead of (9:53 - 9:57)
the game we are away i think i have two (9:55 - 9:59)
somewhere in this house with two more (9:57 - 10:00)
you get a whole play set (9:59 - 10:02)
you go to your local tournament and (10:00 - 10:04)
start throwing down i don't even know (10:02 - 10:05)
what willow does is it like this card (10:04 - 10:07)
the same professor card that every (10:05 - 10:10)
professor card has ever been (10:07 - 10:12)
i think this is cool um (10:10 - 10:13)
[Music] (10:12 - 10:15)
it has been easier at least in my area (10:13 - 10:17)
to find cards (10:15 - 10:20)
i mean it's it's it's a bit of a (10:17 - 10:21)
struggle (10:20 - 10:23)
and there's still like limit three to (10:21 - 10:25)
five per person but like (10:23 - 10:27)
there's usually single booster packs (10:25 - 10:29)
hanging on the shelves (10:27 - 10:32)
um which i don't buy single booster (10:29 - 10:33)
packs anymore it's just like i'm going (10:32 - 10:35)
to buy a box because there's a promo (10:33 - 10:38)
card i want to collect or i am going to (10:35 - 10:40)
buy an etb (10:38 - 10:40)
even though i don't know why i'm buying (10:41 - 10:44)
atvs anymore it's technically more (10:42 - 10:45)
expensive i like the boxes that etb's (10:44 - 10:47)
come in it's good storage for more then (10:45 - 10:50)
you have to move those boxes (10:47 - 10:53)
no will moves those boxes (10:50 - 10:55)
oh deep cats steve we'll move those (10:53 - 10:58)
boxes once i'm going to state this again (10:55 - 11:00)
then you will have to move those boxes (10:58 - 11:01)
because i do not think you're going to (11:00 - 11:03)
get will (11:01 - 11:06)
into that situation ever again (11:03 - 11:07)
hopefully we just get movers because (11:06 - 11:09)
we're not going (11:07 - 11:10)
eight hours (11:09 - 11:13)
uh there was also the the lunar new year (11:10 - 11:15)
event um which i believe by the time (11:13 - 11:17)
this podcast is going up it's ending (11:15 - 11:19)
soon i think this lunar new year is like (11:17 - 11:21)
really lackluster compared to other (11:19 - 11:24)
lunar new years um (11:21 - 11:25)
i have to trade three times with (11:24 - 11:27)
somebody that's just not gonna happen (11:25 - 11:28)
yeah you want to get dinner tonight so (11:27 - 11:30)
we can trade (11:28 - 11:32)
we are making dinner at home i will i (11:30 - 11:34)
will beat you if you want to go hang out (11:32 - 11:37)
and we can trade but that's about it (11:34 - 11:37)
because i need to trade too (11:37 - 11:44)
switching gears a little bit uh this is (11:40 - 11:46)
just off the pokemon website and my (11:44 - 11:48)
wallet is very sad (11:46 - 11:51)
but my my heart is happy (11:48 - 11:54)
uh the wand company and the pokemon (11:51 - 11:56)
company are teaming up again there will (11:54 - 11:59)
be four new metal pokeballs this year (11:56 - 12:01)
starting with the heal ball (11:59 - 12:03)
which is now available that you can (12:01 - 12:05)
pre-order off pokemon center or gamestop (12:03 - 12:08)
or wherever you get these things (12:05 - 12:10)
they are also announcing the friend ball (12:08 - 12:13)
the quick ball and the cherish ball (12:10 - 12:16)
and those will be the the (12:13 - 12:17)
they say the four they have planned (12:16 - 12:18)
throughout the year i don't know if (12:17 - 12:20)
they're gonna add another one on to it (12:18 - 12:21)
but (12:20 - 12:24)
um they did (12:21 - 12:27)
five last year (12:24 - 12:28)
uh because the (12:27 - 12:31)
six technically i guess i don't know (12:28 - 12:33)
because there was the pokeball great (12:31 - 12:35)
ball ultra ball master ball master ball (12:33 - 12:38)
was only exclusive to the pokemon center (12:35 - 12:40)
and it sold out pretty quickly and then (12:38 - 12:43)
they did the premium ball and then the (12:40 - 12:46)
dusk ball which kind of came out at the (12:43 - 12:48)
end of the year kind of the beginning (12:46 - 12:49)
yeah come here what did i say yeah (12:48 - 12:50)
premium (12:49 - 12:54)
premium oh (12:50 - 12:56)
that's the new pokeball that's the new (12:54 - 12:58)
pokemon pokemon arceus legends (12:56 - 13:00)
premium ball while we're talking about (12:58 - 13:01)
balls (13:00 - 13:03)
okay (13:01 - 13:05)
i am (13:03 - 13:07)
actively angry (13:05 - 13:09)
at legends arceus (13:07 - 13:13)
for making me like the great ball (13:09 - 13:15)
because the great ball looks so good in (13:13 - 13:17)
that game yeah it does and the ultra (13:15 - 13:20)
ball looks like trash and so all i use (13:17 - 13:22)
now are great balls and i'm mad about it (13:20 - 13:24)
and somebody needs (13:22 - 13:27)
to just know that this is unacceptable (13:24 - 13:29)
can can we clear up a misconception here (13:27 - 13:32)
that i've seen uh and (13:29 - 13:35)
my wife did the same thing last night (13:32 - 13:37)
she was trying to catch dust cloths (13:35 - 13:40)
and i was like hey just use she's like (13:37 - 13:42)
they they get so angry when i get close (13:40 - 13:44)
and i was like yeah that's a desk ops (13:42 - 13:46)
for you and i was like just use the (13:44 - 13:48)
feather balls and she's like it's not a (13:46 - 13:49)
bird (13:48 - 13:52)
oh no no (13:49 - 13:52)
uh (13:52 - 13:56)
i mean theming-wise i agree with that (13:53 - 13:57)
statement (13:56 - 13:59)
yes (13:57 - 14:02)
i can i completely understand the (13:59 - 14:05)
confusion around the feather balls uh so (14:02 - 14:06)
because especially if you've played (14:05 - 14:08)
other pokemon games where like they're (14:06 - 14:11)
like the net ball or the duskball or (14:08 - 14:15)
i get it the feather balls are just a (14:11 - 14:18)
pokeball it just goes farther that's it (14:15 - 14:20)
that's that's all it does you just you (14:18 - 14:22)
could just throw it farther it doesn't (14:20 - 14:25)
have there are certain things that catch (14:22 - 14:27)
right on like that you have to catch (14:25 - 14:28)
because they're very far away it's the (14:27 - 14:30)
only ball that's going to work (14:28 - 14:32)
uh now that i'm on pokemon center (14:30 - 14:33)
talking did you buy your wife's a (14:32 - 14:35)
registeel polka doll plush (14:33 - 14:37)
uh we do have multiple reggie steals in (14:35 - 14:40)
this house yes (14:37 - 14:40)
here's my okay here's my next question (14:40 - 14:44)
when are they doing the luxury ball (14:43 - 14:46)
because it's the only ball i wish to (14:44 - 14:48)
purchase it's weird that they skipped (14:46 - 14:49)
the luxury ball and they went right into (14:48 - 14:54)
like apricorn stuff with the front ball (14:49 - 14:54)
so mad about it i do find that weird i (14:54 - 14:57)
mean i am a big fan of the heel ball (14:56 - 14:59)
myself but (14:57 - 15:01)
it is weird that luxury ball has been (14:59 - 15:03)
left out so far maybe just it's too hard (15:01 - 15:05)
to make because the luxury ball must be (15:03 - 15:08)
made with 24 karat gold and onyx that's (15:05 - 15:10)
true that's true very expensive (15:08 - 15:11)

metal they're very cool i like them a (16:25 - 16:29)

active black performance tank top dash (16:55 - 16:57)
men (16:56 - 17:01)

that art on the back is (17:01 - 17:05)
creepy i'm not going to continue but (17:03 - 17:07)
creepy creepy it looks like the (17:05 - 17:09)
lightning bolt is controlling pikachu (17:07 - 17:12)
like a marionette and that seems wrong (17:09 - 17:14)
okay oh this looks good (17:12 - 17:17)
look at the back art it's weird it's (17:14 - 17:21)
disturbing the front is good though (17:17 - 17:21)
although it is better than the one of (17:21 - 17:24)
the pikachu tank tops that i have (17:23 - 17:26)
because the pikachu art on that one is (17:24 - 17:28)

pikachu (17:28 - 17:31)

they also released a (18:40 - 18:46)
35 dollar cramer ant skin (18:43 - 18:50)
uh which makes me mad that there are (18:46 - 18:51)
i think the thing that makes me mad (18:50 - 18:54)
about this isn't the price of the cramer (18:51 - 18:56)
ant look i i said on this podcast i'd (18:54 - 18:58)
pay 40 dollars for kramer aunt skin (18:56 - 19:00)
because the first 40 skin was the the (18:58 - 19:01)
nine tails one (19:00 - 19:04)
and then they did a 40 pikachu one and (19:01 - 19:05)
then there's like a forty dollar machamp (19:04 - 19:06)
one (19:05 - 19:08)
they're out there (19:06 - 19:09)
and i'm willing to throw down money for (19:08 - 19:11)
my boy (19:09 - 19:13)
i need i need the pokemon company to (19:11 - 19:16)
know that the the us cramer ant fans (19:13 - 19:19)
have deep wallets (19:16 - 19:21)
the the but the (19:19 - 19:25)
like not fully committed (19:21 - 19:28)
thing they did frustrates me (19:25 - 19:30)
because it's it uh forty dollars is what (19:28 - 19:31)
like (19:30 - 19:34)
2499 as gyms (19:31 - 19:38)
and this cramarat skin is 2100 (19:34 - 19:41)
aos gems it's like 300 gems less (19:38 - 19:44)
so because it's 300 gems less (19:41 - 19:46)
they're like we're not giving it a cool (19:44 - 19:49)
animation like we did machamp or that's (19:46 - 19:51)
why they gave you the discount (19:49 - 19:53)
yeah but like why is there different (19:51 - 19:56)
tiers there should just be like a a (19:53 - 19:59)
common uh uncommon rare ultra rare (19:56 - 20:01)
because the programmers have lost as (19:59 - 20:03)
much interest as the player grace (20:01 - 20:07)
also i will issue a correction to myself (20:03 - 20:09)
machamp is wearing chaps so i'm i'm a (20:07 - 20:11)
little bit back in but the hat is coming (20:09 - 20:13)
so i'm back out (20:11 - 20:15)
but you know if you keep telling them (20:13 - 20:16)
that you'll throw money at kramer and (20:15 - 20:18)
they'll keep coming up with kramer ant (20:16 - 20:20)
stuff for you to buy this is the second (20:18 - 20:21)
one what is the first one with the (20:20 - 20:22)
cooking outfit like do you have a (20:21 - 20:24)
picture (20:22 - 20:26)
did you notice victini in pokemon unite (20:24 - 20:28)
has gotten nothing because they know i (20:26 - 20:30)
will spend no money on any victini (20:28 - 20:32)
anything in pokemon united here i got (20:30 - 20:36)
the pictures right here (20:32 - 20:36)
it's really good (20:38 - 20:40)
feels like a bandana and if you're about (20:42 - 20:46)
to say victini's not in pokemon unite (20:44 - 20:48)
yes that's the point that is what i am (20:46 - 20:50)
saying (20:48 - 20:53)
it's what it's good (20:50 - 20:55)
i don't know it's a cowboy this is as (20:53 - 20:58)
good as a cowboy you're gonna get (20:55 - 21:01)
uh cow person thank you (20:58 - 21:04)
cow bird cattle person thank you very (21:01 - 21:06)

i don't know maybe it's more fun (21:31 - 21:34)
i feel like (21:34 - 21:37)
three three is a crowd on the bottom (21:35 - 21:40)
stresses me out (21:37 - 21:40)

then my last pull (24:02 - 24:06)
it did the whole hey this is going to be (24:04 - 24:07)
a good one (24:06 - 24:09)
and it gave me cygnus suit (24:07 - 24:12)
erica and leafeon (24:09 - 24:14)
no b to be seen (24:12 - 24:16)
that sounds good though i mean i needed (24:14 - 24:18)
it kind of but i think erica is the most (24:16 - 24:21)
in the game right erica has (24:18 - 24:22)
five five (24:21 - 24:24)
yeah yeah i'm pretty sure erica has five (24:22 - 24:27)
somebody on that team likes erica (24:24 - 24:29)
well i mean (24:27 - 24:30)
cute grass there's like a million grass (24:29 - 24:32)
types that you can give erica and you (24:30 - 24:34)
can put her in dresses so yeah she's (24:32 - 24:35)
easy (24:34 - 24:37)
the theme (24:35 - 24:39)
um the valentine's story (24:37 - 24:41)
easy to do what else are they doing oh (24:39 - 24:42)
did we talk about the fact that they (24:41 - 24:44)
added the jute box (24:42 - 24:46)
no can you explain this jukebox i missed (24:44 - 24:48)
this i missed what's happening here (24:46 - 24:51)
there's a chat on it yeah so you can (24:48 - 24:52)
change (24:51 - 24:54)
the music (24:52 - 24:57)
through the jukebox that plays (24:54 - 25:00)
based off of like the various stages or (24:57 - 25:01)
various (25:00 - 25:04)
sync pairs if they have a special theme (25:01 - 25:06)
you can now go to the jukebox (25:04 - 25:10)
and select those songs to play (25:06 - 25:13)
however you need to battle to get (25:10 - 25:18)
coins to buy the songs in the jukebox (25:13 - 25:18)
and there's (25:20 - 25:24)
of course well so it's a daily mission (25:21 - 25:26)
to battle to get jukebox coins it (25:24 - 25:29)
doesn't cost stamina that i can see it (25:26 - 25:30)
might or it costs a little doesn't (25:29 - 25:33)
matter and they've added coins as an (25:30 - 25:36)
additional daily bonus so every daily (25:33 - 25:38)
mission you get you get a certain amount (25:36 - 25:41)
of song coins and then when you have 300 (25:38 - 25:42)
you can go by (25:41 - 25:44)
another song (25:42 - 25:45)
however (25:44 - 25:49)
from what i can tell some songs (25:45 - 25:51)
are now locked behind whether you can (25:49 - 25:55)
pull the pair that that song belongs to (25:51 - 25:59)
so like if you don't have cynthia and (25:55 - 26:02)
como o i don't think you can buy her a (25:59 - 26:04)
song because you didn't get the pair (26:02 - 26:06)
that got the song (26:04 - 26:11)
so it's like another thing to collect (26:06 - 26:11)
and the music for the most part is like (26:11 - 26:15)
there's a lot of good music in there so (26:13 - 26:16)
if you're like i really like to hear (26:15 - 26:18)
this piece and i'm tired of the (26:16 - 26:20)
main theme or the pokemon center theme (26:18 - 26:23)
you can change it to whoever theme that (26:20 - 26:26)
you've purchased (26:23 - 26:26)
got it (26:27 - 26:29)
uh last bit of news before we take a (26:28 - 26:33)
break is uh brilliant stars the next (26:29 - 26:35)
tcg set (26:33 - 26:36)
which is still part of the sword and (26:35 - 26:40)
shield series uh comes out on february (26:36 - 26:42)
25th it will feature 170 (26:40 - 26:44)
cards (26:42 - 26:46)
they did show off some more look you can (26:44 - 26:47)
look at all these cards because they (26:46 - 26:49)
came out in japan like three months ago (26:47 - 26:50)
but this (26:49 - 26:53)
they showed off shaymin v star uh bolton (26:50 - 26:54)
v (26:53 - 26:57)
semi semi crv (26:54 - 26:59)
and alex ray (26:57 - 27:02)
um (26:59 - 27:04)
the pokemon company did send me (27:02 - 27:06)
uh a booster box of these cards (27:04 - 27:08)
so i don't think i'm allowed to open (27:06 - 27:10)
them for like another two weeks though (27:08 - 27:11)
so they're just (27:10 - 27:13)
sitting on a shelf (27:11 - 27:15)
i'm kind of mad that the next vanguard (27:13 - 27:17)
set has like 500 cards in it over 500 (27:15 - 27:20)
cars yeah that's a lot that sounds awful (27:17 - 27:22)
is this yeah (27:20 - 27:24)
is this a good number of cards or is (27:22 - 27:27)
this 170 is a little high okay (27:24 - 27:28)
uh (27:27 - 27:30)
what was that one set though it had like (27:28 - 27:32)
250 or something (27:30 - 27:34)
170 is fine (27:32 - 27:37)
it's okay (27:34 - 27:38)
it's not the worst (27:37 - 27:40)
not the best (27:38 - 27:43)
uh the bolton card is real cute (27:40 - 27:45)
yeah i figured you'd like that one (27:43 - 27:46)
so when you pull it you're gonna give it (27:45 - 27:49)
to me right uh sure uh what was that one (27:46 - 27:51)
set that was really bad not unified no (27:49 - 27:54)
what was it called in japan where is it (27:51 - 27:58)
um i unified mines what was the set oh (27:54 - 28:00)
it's 120 cards i don't know what i was (27:58 - 28:02)
thinking oh cause you need four q is (28:00 - 28:05)
cute (28:02 - 28:05)
fusion strike fusion strike i think was (28:07 - 28:11)
the bad one (28:09 - 28:14)
oh there's a charizard in it fusion (28:11 - 28:15)
strike had (28:14 - 28:19)
280 cards uh (28:15 - 28:20)
i don't think i've ever opened a good (28:19 - 28:22)
pack of fusion strike (28:20 - 28:25)
because it's so filler (28:22 - 28:28)
um so yeah 170 is a is a walk in the (28:25 - 28:30)
park compared to 280. (28:28 - 28:32)
i think the japanese set was called star (28:30 - 28:37)
birth in japan for brilliant stars (28:32 - 28:38)
i'm trying to i want pokebeach to see if (28:37 - 28:40)
i can find it (28:38 - 28:43)
evolving skies was 237 that was right (28:40 - 28:46)
before fusion strike (28:43 - 28:50)
um chilling reigns was 233 (28:46 - 28:52)
um (28:50 - 28:55)
and then battle styles was 183 battle (28:52 - 28:57)
styles was a bad set (28:55 - 28:59)
not that chilling rain was much better (28:57 - 29:02)
uh vivid voltage was 203 so this is the (28:59 - 29:04)
smallest (29:02 - 29:06)
set in a wild not (29:04 - 29:09)
not counting like promotional sets like (29:06 - 29:10)
champions path (29:09 - 29:13)
darkness of blaze was 201 (29:10 - 29:17)
uh rebel clash was (29:13 - 29:17)
209 yeah so the set the set is actually (29:17 - 29:21)
really small i take it back this seems (29:20 - 29:24)
like a good number i have a question (29:21 - 29:27)
so they say there's like 170 (29:24 - 29:28)
cards right (29:27 - 29:29)
yeah (29:28 - 29:31)
are there like because i know like (29:29 - 29:33)
people are like oh it's a secret rare is (29:31 - 29:35)
are like secret rares (29:33 - 29:37)
counted in that total no (29:35 - 29:39)
okay because they're secrets (29:37 - 29:40)
yeah they don't let you know until (29:39 - 29:42)
people figure it out the real number (29:40 - 29:44)
could be a lot higher oh there's not (29:42 - 29:45)
that many (29:44 - 29:47)
uh you're not going to get more than 20 (29:45 - 29:50)
secret rares yeah it's about 15 (29:47 - 29:53)
if even that many (29:50 - 29:53)
yeah it's uh it the number could go up a (29:55 - 30:00)
little bit yeah but 170 numbered cards (29:57 - 30:02)
is what they're saying oh okay (30:00 - 30:05)
secret writers go above the number (30:02 - 30:07)
there's a staple (30:05 - 30:10)
iv there's there's a lot same wise (30:07 - 30:12)
i love sable i know you should get into (30:10 - 30:15)
you should get into the uh (30:12 - 30:18)
the psa game but only for a specific (30:15 - 30:20)
pokemon like i'm only going to collect (30:18 - 30:22)
psa stabilizers (30:20 - 30:25)
rated 10 stabilized yeah (30:22 - 30:26)
that sounds awful (30:25 - 30:28)
[Laughter] (30:26 - 30:32)
i just like the look of sable iv (30:28 - 30:35)
then get you one my friend get you one (30:32 - 30:37)
super cute except the one that's on this (30:35 - 30:38)
picture isn't as good as the one that's (30:37 - 30:41)
on the front absolutely (30:38 - 30:43)
all right well as greg looks at the (30:41 - 30:45)
newfound sableye cards that have existed (30:43 - 30:48)
for 20 some years uh let's (30:45 - 30:48)
let's take a break this is super cute (30:49 - 30:55)
uh when we come back we'll talk uh i (30:53 - 30:56)
think we're i think we're caught up with (30:55 - 30:58)
news otherwise when we come back well uh (30:56 - 31:00)
we'll talk about some legends and we (30:58 - 31:01)
will (31:00 - 31:04)
be right back (31:01 - 31:07)
but i tried it it was good hey shiny (31:04 - 31:09)
we did it (31:07 - 31:13)
there it is i need a feather ball though (31:09 - 31:15)
oh i just threw it at the ground look at (31:13 - 31:17)
how bad it looks (31:15 - 31:19)
oh it doesn't look too bad in this game (31:17 - 31:21)
actually it's pretty noticeable (31:19 - 31:24)
come here (31:21 - 31:24)
and we are back from our break (31:25 - 31:31)
uh hey some more news here (31:28 - 31:33)
uh the first distribution for pokemon (31:31 - 31:36)
legends arceus is going to be available (31:33 - 31:37)
starting at the end of the month from (31:36 - 31:41)
february 25th through march 13th you'll (31:37 - 31:44)
be able to get an assoiant growlithe (31:41 - 31:47)
and 20 feather balls uh if you're in the (31:44 - 31:49)
u.s from gamestop (31:47 - 31:51)
uh it is not shiny it is to celebrate (31:49 - 31:55)
the release of brilliant stars (31:51 - 31:56)
um (31:55 - 31:58)
i know that you know people (31:56 - 32:00)
anytime there's a non-shiny distribution (31:58 - 32:02)
the complaints are why isn't it shiny (32:00 - 32:04)
this is useless (32:02 - 32:06)
um (32:04 - 32:08)
you know if you want my opinion i like (32:06 - 32:10)
collecting event pokemon because they (32:08 - 32:12)
are of (32:10 - 32:14)
their events and you can only get them (32:12 - 32:16)
from a specific time (32:14 - 32:19)
so if in my case i like that it will say (32:16 - 32:21)
that it's from a faithful encounter (32:19 - 32:23)
versus the gralis you just catch in the (32:21 - 32:25)
overworld which will say (32:23 - 32:28)
caught in (32:25 - 32:28)
field lands or whatever city and field (32:28 - 32:32)
lands it is a fateful (32:30 - 32:34)
fate (32:32 - 32:37)
faith fateful fateful encounter (32:34 - 32:38)
um (32:37 - 32:40)
this is just promotional stuff (32:38 - 32:43)
nothing (32:40 - 32:45)
nothing super fancy here (32:43 - 32:47)
look you walk into game stop you pick up (32:45 - 32:48)
your brilliant stars they hand you a (32:47 - 32:49)
code you walk out you don't really think (32:48 - 32:52)
about it twice (32:49 - 32:52)
this is not (32:54 - 33:00)
worth me stepping foot into a game stop (32:56 - 33:02)
you got to go to the secret one in egan (33:00 - 33:04)
trust me it's worth it all right you and (33:02 - 33:06)
i will go to the secret one in eagan but (33:04 - 33:07)
what if we're at mall america we're just (33:06 - 33:10)
doing laps i mean eventually just walk (33:07 - 33:11)
in walk out (33:10 - 33:14)
i mean you got that one too yes (33:11 - 33:16)
the mall america one isn't bad because (33:14 - 33:18)
it's so big (33:16 - 33:20)
it's very large it is very i'm just (33:18 - 33:23)
saying this is not enough for me to go (33:20 - 33:25)
out of my way to do this yes (33:23 - 33:26)
we are (33:25 - 33:30)
if if we happen to stumble upon (33:26 - 33:32)
in my normal day-to-day business a game (33:30 - 33:35)
stop then yes so here's here's the (33:32 - 33:36)
secret (33:35 - 33:38)
across the street from the one in egan (33:36 - 33:40)
is taco libre (33:38 - 33:43)
taco libre is really really good (33:40 - 33:46)
so just plan on getting some taco libre (33:43 - 33:48)
for lunch or dinner and then pop into (33:46 - 33:51)
the game stop while you're there (33:48 - 33:51)
i i like this again i like that it says (33:51 - 33:57)
that it's specifically from a fateful (33:54 - 34:00)
encounter versus um they did this a lot (33:57 - 34:01)
in sword and shield where like if you (34:00 - 34:03)
went to best buyer who went to gamestop (34:01 - 34:05)
they would give you a code (34:03 - 34:09)
and the mystery gift would be for um (34:05 - 34:11)
uh what did they what were they called (34:09 - 34:13)
like the chris the dynamaxx crystals so (34:11 - 34:15)
then you would drop the dynomax crystal (34:13 - 34:16)
into the den (34:15 - 34:18)
and then the pikachu or the eevee or (34:16 - 34:21)
whatever would spawn but then it would (34:18 - 34:25)
just have like your ot and your (34:21 - 34:26)
um (34:25 - 34:28)
your stuff so it wouldn't (34:26 - 34:30)
feel unique in that aspect (34:28 - 34:34)
takes away from the special (34:30 - 34:34)
i feel like i've i have not missed a (34:35 - 34:40)
gamestop distribution at this point (34:38 - 34:42)
maybe i have but i feel like i got a lot (34:40 - 34:44)
of i did miss that halloween they had (34:42 - 34:47)
like a shiny halloween gengar back in (34:44 - 34:49)
2006 (34:47 - 34:53)
uh and i traded for that actually so (34:49 - 34:55)
um i take it back this was not the first (34:53 - 34:56)
distribution (34:55 - 34:58)
for (34:56 - 34:59)
uh (34:58 - 35:02)
legends there is in japan from february (34:59 - 35:03)
5th through the 22nd if you go to a (35:02 - 35:06)
pokemon center give the secret (35:03 - 35:10)
uh passphrase you will get a (35:06 - 35:14)
leaflet with a code for a piplup on it (35:10 - 35:14)
nothing special about that piplup either (35:14 - 35:19)
uh except it will it does have a set ot (35:16 - 35:21)
uh it does have a set id which i'm (35:19 - 35:23)
assuming the growlith will have set ot (35:21 - 35:24)
set id (35:23 - 35:27)
um once we know more about it and it is (35:24 - 35:31)
a fateful encounter at level 15. (35:27 - 35:33)
so (35:31 - 35:34)
not look (35:33 - 35:36)
non-shiny people up in japan non-shiny (35:34 - 35:40)
growlithe in in in the us it's okay (35:36 - 35:42)
if it was shiny the comments would just (35:40 - 35:44)
instead of being like the comments right (35:42 - 35:45)
now which are this is useless why isn't (35:44 - 35:47)
it shiny if it was shiny the comments (35:45 - 35:48)
would be like ah they're just hanging (35:47 - 35:49)
out chinese left and right there's (35:48 - 35:51)
always like it's this everyone's (35:49 - 35:53)
complaining it's fine it's okay it's (35:51 - 35:55)
okay (35:53 - 35:57)
if you if you don't want the growlithe (35:55 - 35:59)
here's what you can do (35:57 - 36:00)
don't get the growlithe (35:59 - 36:03)
[Laughter] (36:00 - 36:06)
it's fine very true you just ignore it (36:03 - 36:09)
it's okay i want to do so (36:06 - 36:12)
i want the i hope it has a good ot like (36:09 - 36:15)
corporate (36:12 - 36:15)
from corporate trainer it's gonna be (36:15 - 36:19)
paulina (36:17 - 36:23)
polina it will be the ot will be polina (36:19 - 36:23)
um (36:23 - 36:28)
without getting too spoilery because (36:25 - 36:30)
we'll save that for thursday how we (36:28 - 36:32)
feeling about legends will where we at (36:30 - 36:34)
well as i said i've just unlocked area (36:32 - 36:36)
four (36:34 - 36:38)
um (36:36 - 36:40)
i i (36:38 - 36:41)
i don't know (36:40 - 36:44)
[Laughter] (36:41 - 36:46)
i i'll probably get through the story (36:44 - 36:48)
and be done with it (36:46 - 36:50)
you don't like it (36:48 - 36:51)
uh i (36:50 - 36:53)
have had a lot of issues which i can (36:51 - 36:55)
probably discuss later (36:53 - 36:58)
um that yeah have really detracted from (36:55 - 37:01)
me enjoying the game so (36:58 - 37:01)
i mean it's a good game it's just not (37:03 - 37:06)
for me (37:04 - 37:07)
not enough monster hunter not enough (37:06 - 37:10)
pokemon is what i'm feeling from you (37:07 - 37:14)
uh no that's i wouldn't say that (37:10 - 37:14)
where you at greg i have gotten credits (37:17 - 37:22)
hmm (37:21 - 37:25)
i too have gotten credits (37:22 - 37:27)
and i have a lot of thoughts about these (37:25 - 37:28)
credits (37:27 - 37:29)
um (37:28 - 37:31)
i i i do too i know some of your (37:29 - 37:34)
thoughts which i just disagree with but (37:31 - 37:35)
um (37:34 - 37:38)
overall i think (37:35 - 37:38)
this has been a very it's been a very (37:40 - 37:45)
enjoyable experience (37:42 - 37:46)
um (37:45 - 37:48)
again (37:46 - 37:48)
it's a it is a very solid b plus (37:49 - 37:55)
game like i i unlike brilliant diamond (37:52 - 37:57)
shining pearl where i was dreading (37:55 - 38:00)
thinking about playing again i am (37:57 - 38:02)
seriously thinking like okay so i (38:00 - 38:05)
grabbed my other switch and i pick a (38:02 - 38:06)
different starter and i start the story (38:05 - 38:09)
again because i'm really into (38:06 - 38:11)
the overall story that they're telling (38:09 - 38:12)
in this game (38:11 - 38:14)
um (38:12 - 38:16)
i i think they've done a lot of things (38:14 - 38:20)
very very well so i have i have the itch (38:16 - 38:21)
i have with a lot of pokemon games is (38:20 - 38:23)
that oh i want to play this again i want (38:21 - 38:25)
to experience this again which i didn't (38:23 - 38:27)
have for brilliant diamond shining (38:25 - 38:29)
pearl yeah (38:27 - 38:30)
um (38:29 - 38:33)
so i'm quite happy with it (38:30 - 38:35)
i will i will we'll talk about the story (38:33 - 38:36)
more on thursday i'll just say that i (38:35 - 38:38)
dislike the story (38:36 - 38:40)
um but i would say that it did not (38:38 - 38:42)
detract from my overall enjoyment from (38:40 - 38:45)
the game i love x and y i think those (38:42 - 38:47)
are great games and i've said many times (38:45 - 38:49)
on this podcast that i cannot stand that (38:47 - 38:51)
x and y story (38:49 - 38:54)
um but it never detracted from (38:51 - 38:56)
the the journey of being a pokemon (38:54 - 38:57)
trainer which i think i can always (38:56 - 38:59)
separate in my head of like (38:57 - 39:02)
even though the story is bad i am still (38:59 - 39:03)
building a team i'm still collecting (39:02 - 39:05)
badges i am still trying to be the (39:03 - 39:06)
champion and that (39:05 - 39:09)
has always felt good in x and y i think (39:06 - 39:11)
it feels really good in x and y honestly (39:09 - 39:13)
to like just (39:11 - 39:15)
collect those badges and like build the (39:13 - 39:16)
team and you have so much variety next (39:15 - 39:18)
time with your pokemon choices in that (39:16 - 39:21)
game and then beat diantha at the end (39:18 - 39:23)
um (39:21 - 39:24)
this game doesn't capture that same (39:23 - 39:26)
thing because it's it's it's not really (39:24 - 39:28)
a spoiler we've been talking about this (39:26 - 39:29)
since the game came out like there's (39:28 - 39:32)
really not a lot that the game reward (39:29 - 39:34)
like your team is kind of like an (39:32 - 39:37)
afterthought in this game (39:34 - 39:38)
um (39:37 - 39:39)
yeah for some reason i still have a (39:38 - 39:41)
floatzel on mine and i'm like i don't (39:39 - 39:42)
like you (39:41 - 39:44)
but i haven't had a motivation to either (39:42 - 39:48)
to take you off either (39:44 - 39:48)
i will say this the only time i've (39:49 - 39:54)
swapped up my team is to complete a (39:52 - 39:57)
pokedex entry (39:54 - 40:00)
um and i will also say that (39:57 - 40:03)
some of these new evolution methods are (40:00 - 40:04)
super excessive (40:03 - 40:07)
yep i was gonna say that was that was (40:04 - 40:08)
the one thing i wanted to touch on this (40:07 - 40:12)
episode is how (40:08 - 40:12)
how how how do they do this how do (40:13 - 40:19)
who's who's over on that team what (40:17 - 40:21)
choices are they making so i don't know (40:19 - 40:22)
if we've talked about this yet but there (40:21 - 40:24)
there's an item that they added it's (40:22 - 40:25)
called the link cable (40:24 - 40:28)
really cleverly named really cute (40:25 - 40:31)
amazing throwback everything about it (40:28 - 40:34)
and if you don't know (40:31 - 40:37)
um and this is not a spoiler (40:34 - 40:39)
you can get every pokemon (40:37 - 40:41)
in your copy of your game without (40:39 - 40:42)
trading (40:41 - 40:45)
you can so you can get both the alga and (40:42 - 40:48)
palkia without trading you can get all (40:45 - 40:50)
the starters without trading which means (40:48 - 40:52)
that those pokemon will exist somewhere (40:50 - 40:53)
in the game (40:52 - 40:56)
um and this is the first (40:53 - 40:58)
main series pokemon game to do that (40:56 - 40:59)
that's probably why they only have one (40:58 - 41:01)
copy and not (40:59 - 41:02)
two (41:01 - 41:03)
uh (41:02 - 41:05)
[Music] (41:03 - 41:09)
so if you wanted to get alakazam or (41:05 - 41:12)
machamp or gengar or what was the last (41:09 - 41:14)
one (41:12 - 41:16)
uh golem golem (41:14 - 41:18)
you can use the link cable item to (41:16 - 41:22)
evolve said pokemon but the trading (41:18 - 41:25)
method still works like i can trade greg (41:22 - 41:27)
a cadabra and it will still evolve into (41:25 - 41:29)
an alakazam (41:27 - 41:31)
and i think that's fantastic i think (41:29 - 41:33)
that's really great for have you looked (41:31 - 41:35)
at the trade screen when you have you (41:33 - 41:38)
done a trade okay (41:35 - 41:40)
if nothing else it is worth doing a (41:38 - 41:42)
trade once because the trade sequence is (41:40 - 41:44)
so (41:42 - 41:46)
they went so hard on that and they did (41:44 - 41:49)
not need to and it is a pure joy from (41:46 - 41:52)
beginning to end it is fantastic it is (41:49 - 41:54)
so good (41:52 - 41:55)
so (41:54 - 41:59)
hopefully stuff like this continues (41:55 - 42:02)
where they that where you like (41:59 - 42:05)
you can use an item to evolve (42:02 - 42:07)
or you can just trade it the (42:05 - 42:09)
old-fashioned way (42:07 - 42:12)
um well i mean (42:09 - 42:14)
they took like the hint from go right (42:12 - 42:16)
like yeah you can trade it or you can (42:14 - 42:17)
pay (42:16 - 42:21)
more million candy (42:17 - 42:21)
and i and i hope that in future games (42:21 - 42:26)
they don't remove that although (42:23 - 42:28)
they remove the weirdest stuff and then (42:26 - 42:30)
like (42:28 - 42:32)
like like in let's go let's go ahead and (42:30 - 42:34)
mass release (42:32 - 42:36)
and then the two games after it didn't (42:34 - 42:38)
have mass release and then this game has (42:36 - 42:40)
maps this game has mass release (42:38 - 42:43)
like the like the thing that they also (42:40 - 42:44)
did in let's go (42:43 - 42:46)
let's go is a great game by the way (42:44 - 42:49)
you could favorite pokemon and let's go (42:46 - 42:52)
why can we not favorite pokemon in the (42:49 - 42:55)
next three games i want to favorite my (42:52 - 42:58)
alphas or on a favorite my shiny so i (42:55 - 43:00)
don't accidentally throw them away i (42:58 - 43:04)
will say though that this game finally (43:00 - 43:06)
if you if you mass release like 30 (43:04 - 43:08)
pokemon and there's a shiny in the (43:06 - 43:10)
middle of it it will let you know that (43:08 - 43:12)
there is it'll say there's a rare (43:10 - 43:14)
pokemon um yeah we'll do that for (43:12 - 43:16)
shinings i've tested this it will not do (43:14 - 43:18)
that for alphas it does not care that an (43:16 - 43:21)
alpha is like special in any way (43:18 - 43:23)
i don't know about legends though i (43:21 - 43:24)
should try that with like dialga i (43:23 - 43:26)
should try to release diagon and see if (43:24 - 43:27)
it yells at me (43:26 - 43:28)
um (43:27 - 43:30)
but yeah if you try to release the shiny (43:28 - 43:31)
in a (43:30 - 43:34)
by itself or in mass releasing (43:31 - 43:36)
it will (43:34 - 43:38)
just yell it will say like there's a (43:36 - 43:39)
really rare pokemon are you sure you (43:38 - 43:41)
want to do this (43:39 - 43:44)
so that's cool that's cool um (43:41 - 43:46)
again i favoriting wasn't let's go it's (43:44 - 43:48)
still not in this game (43:46 - 43:50)
the the (43:48 - 43:52)
oh but going back to trade items they so (43:50 - 43:55)
you have ursulina you have cleaver (43:52 - 43:57)
you have um quillfish (43:55 - 44:01)
you have uh what's it called quill (43:57 - 44:02)
overquill (44:01 - 44:04)
over cool yeah (44:02 - 44:06)
there's like another one and (44:04 - 44:07)
there (44:06 - 44:08)
let's just have (44:07 - 44:09)
more (44:08 - 44:13)
garbage single time use items to evolve (44:09 - 44:16)
all of these pokemon (44:13 - 44:16)
and it's like why (44:16 - 44:19)
what i mean (44:18 - 44:21)
like you're never going to use pete (44:19 - 44:23)
salmon rock or whatever you need for (44:21 - 44:25)
ursaluna ever again you specifically (44:23 - 44:26)
need it for ursaluna and you'll get like (44:25 - 44:28)
17 of them and you (44:26 - 44:31)
that's they're only for ursulina (44:28 - 44:34)
and then you need all gu agumon rock for (44:31 - 44:35)
for cleaver (44:34 - 44:37)
only for cleaver (44:35 - 44:40)
black black aura site and you can't you (44:37 - 44:43)
can't trade these rocks or anything (44:40 - 44:45)
and at least in (44:43 - 44:46)
when (44:45 - 44:49)
johto came around they were like here's (44:46 - 44:51)
metal coat it can be worked on it works (44:49 - 44:54)
on scissor it works on steelix i think (44:51 - 44:58)
it works on like one other pokemon (44:54 - 44:58)
why are we still introducing single use (44:59 - 45:06)
weird obscure (45:04 - 45:09)
whatever items in this game (45:06 - 45:11)
and then you go to that trader girl (45:09 - 45:14)
she has the link cable you can buy (45:11 - 45:16)
and she has every firestones water (45:14 - 45:18)
stones sunstones moonstones all this (45:16 - 45:21)
stuff and you're like (45:18 - 45:21)
fix this (45:22 - 45:24)
there's too many (45:23 - 45:27)
[Music] (45:24 - 45:27)
they're not fun to collect (45:28 - 45:32)
i will i will say this (45:35 - 45:40)
that most of the items at least you can (45:38 - 45:41)
get (45:40 - 45:43)
very easily in (45:41 - 45:46)
the over world like me two hours to find (45:43 - 45:49)
a rock for ursulina or whatever it's (45:46 - 45:51)
called the pete (45:49 - 45:51)
what are you doing (45:52 - 45:56)
i was every time i dug up i dug up (45:54 - 45:59)
either mud or crab cakes or something i (45:56 - 46:01)
it took forever i will say it's kind of (45:59 - 46:03)
weird because i'm having a hard time (46:01 - 46:05)
finding wood (46:03 - 46:07)
oh yeah there's like only a few (46:05 - 46:10)
locations that have wood (46:07 - 46:11)
um (46:10 - 46:15)
it fro i will quote to you a text that i (46:11 - 46:18)
got from a quote-unquote sympathetic (46:15 - 46:20)
friend last night (46:18 - 46:21)
uh (46:20 - 46:24)
just get lucky noob um (46:21 - 46:26)
that's sure you do yeah it's 50 50. you (46:24 - 46:27)
either get the (46:26 - 46:29)
yeah (46:27 - 46:30)
but also there are just (46:29 - 46:35)
there are also a lot of very bizarre (46:30 - 46:36)
we're not really going to tell you how (46:35 - 46:39)
to evolve this just (46:36 - 46:41)
i don't do it and (46:39 - 46:44)
and (46:41 - 46:44)
also we're not going to necessarily tell (46:44 - 46:48)
you what conditions have to be happening (46:46 - 46:50)
for you to do it (46:48 - 46:53)
figure it out i don't understand this i (46:50 - 46:58)
don't understand this mindset of (46:53 - 46:58)
okay for ursaluna you need the you need (46:58 - 47:01)
the peat (46:59 - 47:04)
but you also have to evolve it during a (47:01 - 47:06)
full moon (47:04 - 47:06)
and to be fair if you're not paying (47:09 - 47:12)
attention to the sky you probably didn't (47:10 - 47:14)
notice that the moons are changing (47:12 - 47:16)
and if you think (47:14 - 47:18)
oh it will show me on the overworld map (47:16 - 47:21)
because it shows me the time of day nope (47:18 - 47:22)
it keeps us uh (47:21 - 47:24)
they keep a crescent moon symbol to (47:22 - 47:27)
signify night and will not tell you (47:24 - 47:29)
what phase the moon is in also if (47:27 - 47:31)
there's any weather condition that could (47:29 - 47:36)
possibly obscure the moon it will (47:31 - 47:36)
so it doesn't matter if you're looking (47:37 - 47:40)
up at the sky if you're not in a (47:38 - 47:42)
location where you can they've decided (47:40 - 47:43)
you can see the moon or if the weather (47:42 - 47:46)
conditions aren't perfect you can't see (47:43 - 47:48)
the moon (47:46 - 47:50)
yeah (47:48 - 47:51)
i think for me the fourth area was the (47:50 - 47:54)
best part to look at the moon because it (47:51 - 47:57)
rose over the mountain (47:54 - 48:00)
okay but here here's my (47:57 - 48:00)
so that mechanic in itself (48:03 - 48:09)
for ursuluna it's like okay it's clever (48:05 - 48:11)
it's cute right like it the the bear has (48:09 - 48:13)
a full moon on its head with like little (48:11 - 48:15)
clouds i get it (48:13 - 48:18)
we also needed the peat rock (48:15 - 48:19)
also (48:18 - 48:22)
like does this mean that full moons have (48:19 - 48:24)
to come back in future games and if it (48:22 - 48:26)
doesn't then it's just a specific (48:24 - 48:27)
gimmick for this game (48:26 - 48:30)
well i given how this game has played (48:27 - 48:31)
out i (48:30 - 48:32)
i (48:31 - 48:35)
worry 100 that any of these new forms (48:32 - 48:37)
are going to be able to move past this (48:35 - 48:39)
yeah at all (48:37 - 48:42)
like i i don't think (48:39 - 48:45)
we are we are already having a problem (48:42 - 48:47)
of (48:45 - 48:47)
things not come like we still don't have (48:47 - 48:52)
seasons to change saul's book like that (48:50 - 48:54)
happened in one game and has never come (48:52 - 48:57)
back pokemon go has introduced them but (48:54 - 48:59)
you can't change them you have to catch (48:57 - 49:00)
them in that season (48:59 - 49:03)
and which i think is fine for go (49:00 - 49:05)
it's fine for go but what i'm thinking (49:03 - 49:07)
is like okay so we know that there's not (49:05 - 49:09)
going to be full pokedexes anymore and (49:07 - 49:12)
it gets really easy to make the decision (49:09 - 49:13)
of what do we leave behind (49:12 - 49:15)
we leave behind the things that only (49:13 - 49:18)
happen in that region (49:15 - 49:18)
and then those become distributions in (49:19 - 49:23)
future and they become distributions or (49:21 - 49:24)
things that you collect because you'll (49:23 - 49:26)
never be able to evolve them again and (49:24 - 49:27)
it (49:26 - 49:29)
it is just a mindset that it began to (49:27 - 49:31)
shift to to realize that regional forums (49:29 - 49:34)
are probably just a thing that they feel (49:31 - 49:37)
comfortable leaving behind (49:34 - 49:39)
because it was in that region only and (49:37 - 49:40)
there's no reason to bring it and we'll (49:39 - 49:42)
bring it in the safari zone or some (49:40 - 49:44)
random trainer has one of them to give (49:42 - 49:46)
you and that's it (49:44 - 49:48)
they could they could have done deerling (49:46 - 49:50)
in this game the winter deerling is on (49:48 - 49:51)
the fifth one the (49:50 - 49:52)
the (49:51 - 49:54)
fall deerling is on the second one the (49:52 - 49:57)
spring deer they could (49:54 - 49:59)
do dearling if they wanted to (49:57 - 50:02)
my problem is that (49:59 - 50:04)
i don't even know when this started was (50:02 - 50:06)
did the start an x and y or did they (50:04 - 50:08)
start in sun and moon where they (50:06 - 50:11)
introduced these evolution methods that (50:08 - 50:14)
you literally have no way of knowing (50:11 - 50:16)
without looking it up (50:14 - 50:18)
um oh no no they've been doing that for (50:16 - 50:20)
a very long time hitmontop i would say (50:18 - 50:22)
is probably the first one that i don't (50:20 - 50:24)
think or the oldest one (50:22 - 50:26)
hip on top was the one that was like (50:24 - 50:29)
what it felt it was positive somebody in (50:26 - 50:32)
the game though tells you how to do it (50:29 - 50:32)
no (50:33 - 50:35)
because then they would have had to (50:34 - 50:38)
explain eevees yeah (50:35 - 50:40)
they never do that in the game (50:38 - 50:43)
not to any amount of detail (50:40 - 50:45)
i want to say the one that was probably (50:43 - 50:46)
the one that everybody kind of picked (50:45 - 50:51)
out is that when this happened was enkei (50:46 - 50:53)
but that's that's that's an evolution (50:51 - 50:55)
method that (50:53 - 50:58)
it where it's lost (50:55 - 51:01)
right like yeah i mean you just you (50:58 - 51:02)
can't there's no (51:01 - 51:04)
gyroscope to (51:02 - 51:05)
i mean there is except that you're (51:04 - 51:07)
playing your switch on your tv (51:05 - 51:09)
so you're not holding your switch upside (51:07 - 51:11)
down right here and shield you have to (51:09 - 51:12)
play in handheld mode and in sword and (51:11 - 51:14)
shield (51:12 - 51:15)
for ink you have to play it in handheld (51:14 - 51:18)
mode without a pro controller attached (51:15 - 51:19)
because the pro controller will disable (51:18 - 51:21)
handheld mode nice and treat it as (51:19 - 51:24)
tabletop mode but i want to say that (51:21 - 51:26)
x and y was the first (51:24 - 51:28)
one people i think we can point to (51:26 - 51:30)
definitively say (51:28 - 51:34)
evolution methods got real wild here (51:30 - 51:36)
because of increasing them being (51:34 - 51:37)
but (51:36 - 51:41)
you have so many npcs in these games (51:37 - 51:43)
that tell you literally nothing (51:41 - 51:45)
they're just fluff (51:43 - 51:48)
why is what but i just don't get it why (51:45 - 51:52)
is there not an npc in a tent being like (51:48 - 51:54)
hey have you heard about ursulina i feel (51:52 - 51:58)
like they love full moons or something (51:54 - 52:01)
or i just think that it's (51:58 - 52:03)
they they want you to find out from (52:01 - 52:05)
talking to your friends where like one (52:03 - 52:07)
friend did it (52:05 - 52:10)
and was like oh wow this just happened (52:07 - 52:12)
because these conditions and then they (52:10 - 52:13)
tell other people and you go on the (52:12 - 52:15)
internet and look it up anyways okay but (52:13 - 52:17)
they realized in this game people don't (52:15 - 52:18)
have friends that's why they introduced (52:17 - 52:20)
the link cable they still everybody has (52:18 - 52:23)
the internet (52:20 - 52:25)
but why are you like why is there not (52:23 - 52:27)
just an npc like near the fishing thing (52:25 - 52:29)
being like (52:27 - 52:31)
recoil really sucks for badge elite (52:29 - 52:34)
basket legion like because that's that's (52:31 - 52:35)
how you evolve vasculation you need to (52:34 - 52:37)
do a specific amount of recoil or (52:35 - 52:40)
something and then you have to so as far (52:37 - 52:41)
as i can tell because this is a very (52:40 - 52:45)
frustrating thing and if you do follow (52:41 - 52:48)
the um (52:45 - 52:50)
pokedex to complete certain tasks in it (52:48 - 52:53)
this will happen naturally but (52:50 - 52:56)
it has to take (52:53 - 52:56)
depending on what you look at x amount (52:56 - 53:03)
of recoil damage and survive each time (52:58 - 53:05)
and once it reaches a threshold it can (53:03 - 53:06)
evolve yeah (53:05 - 53:09)
and i've seen it where it says (53:06 - 53:11)
some people say it has to take 300 (53:09 - 53:13)
points of damage and recoil overtime and (53:11 - 53:16)
has survived each of those recoils and (53:13 - 53:18)
some people are saying it's 700 some (53:16 - 53:21)
people have a wide range in between so (53:18 - 53:23)
so that's a good question it's like is (53:21 - 53:25)
that in the the pokedex does it say in (53:23 - 53:29)
the ursa ring pokedex feed this poke (53:25 - 53:32)
pokemon x thing out under the full moon (53:29 - 53:34)
no the pokedex is so like (53:32 - 53:36)
evolve three or sorry i think that's all (53:34 - 53:41)
it is the the for masculine it says c (53:36 - 53:43)
uh double-edged 40 times and sieve wave (53:41 - 53:45)
crash 40 times (53:43 - 53:47)
and so if you do that that amount of (53:45 - 53:49)
times it will take the recoil damage (53:47 - 53:52)
provided it survives what it doesn't (53:49 - 53:53)
tell you is if it didn't survive the (53:52 - 53:55)
recoil damage that that damage doesn't (53:53 - 53:57)
count (53:55 - 53:58)
so (53:57 - 54:00)
if you do that to get to 40 times (53:58 - 54:02)
eventually you'll have to take it you're (54:00 - 54:04)
survived enough to take enough damage (54:02 - 54:06)
that you'll evolve the amount in there (54:04 - 54:08)
is shifty (54:06 - 54:10)
i i don't know what the real answer is (54:08 - 54:13)
because i had i wasn't keeping track (54:10 - 54:14)
hey it wasn't like have your notepad out (54:13 - 54:16)
right now like i took this much damage (54:14 - 54:18)
and recoil (54:16 - 54:22)
um which also the thing is if you go to (54:18 - 54:24)
like i'm gonna run around obsidian field (54:22 - 54:28)
lands and just take out lesser pokemon (54:24 - 54:30)
since it's x amount of damage it has to (54:28 - 54:31)
take like (54:30 - 54:33)
you'll be doing that for a very long (54:31 - 54:35)
time because you don't take a ton of (54:33 - 54:37)
recoil damage if it didn't have a lot of (54:35 - 54:40)
help well and yeah for people who don't (54:37 - 54:42)
understand the recoil is based on the (54:40 - 54:44)
amount of damage you dealt to the (54:42 - 54:46)
pokemon (54:44 - 54:46)
but it's like they (54:48 - 54:51)
it took them how long to learn their (54:50 - 54:55)
lesson with leafeon and glacion (54:51 - 54:56)
like in sword shield they're like you (54:55 - 54:57)
know what (54:56 - 55:00)
we are sick of placing down the mossy (54:57 - 55:02)
rock and the the the and they they made (55:00 - 55:06)
these rocks for literally these pokemon (55:02 - 55:09)
that's it and they're in this game (55:06 - 55:12)
the bossy rock there's a mossy rock (55:09 - 55:13)
and others i'm pretty sure there's an (55:12 - 55:14)
icy rock (55:13 - 55:15)
in (55:14 - 55:16)
legends (55:15 - 55:19)
i know there's a mossy rock i found it (55:16 - 55:21)
it's in the obsidian field lance and you (55:19 - 55:23)
can you can just use the leaf stone in (55:21 - 55:24)
an ice stone now and you can just use (55:23 - 55:26)
the leaves on a nice stone and they they (55:24 - 55:27)
change that in sword and shield that was (55:26 - 55:29)
a good change yeah and then in sword and (55:27 - 55:31)
shield and who knows in future games (55:29 - 55:34)
they're like to evolve yeah mask into (55:31 - 55:36)
roon regas you need to like stand on (55:34 - 55:37)
your head (55:36 - 55:39)
do this amount of damage and then walk (55:37 - 55:42)
under this pillar specifically when it's (55:39 - 55:45)
the fourth wednesday of the month (55:42 - 55:45)
i mean they just might do that for the (55:45 - 55:50)
special pokemon for one game and then (55:48 - 55:52)
simplify it for future games i mean i (55:50 - 55:54)
was surprised that ursulina wasn't a (55:52 - 55:56)
moonstone (55:54 - 55:59)
that's why is it just not a moonstone on (55:56 - 56:01)
a full moon like that's what it should (55:59 - 56:04)
have been (56:01 - 56:04)
or just leave the moon thing out of it (56:04 - 56:08)
because you can't see the moon (56:06 - 56:10)
sixty percent of the time anyways it's (56:08 - 56:12)
it's it like (56:10 - 56:14)
mind-boggling boggling to me that they (56:12 - 56:17)
keep introducing new items and okay this (56:14 - 56:20)
is a spoiler (56:17 - 56:20)
there is one mission that that if you (56:20 - 56:25)
haven't noticed the moon (56:23 - 56:29)
is based around seeing the moon (56:25 - 56:31)
so there's one mission very late in the (56:29 - 56:34)
game that finally says hey if you (56:31 - 56:36)
haven't been looking at the moon you (56:34 - 56:37)
need to look at the moon (56:36 - 56:39)
which was the first time when i got that (56:37 - 56:41)
mission (56:39 - 56:44)
that i went (56:41 - 56:46)
oh the moon actually does have faces in (56:44 - 56:47)
this game i didn't even know there was a (56:46 - 56:50)
moon in this game yeah i i noticed it in (56:47 - 56:52)
the sky but i'd always noticed it look (56:50 - 56:54)
at the same time so it always looks like (56:52 - 56:56)
it was the same moon (56:54 - 56:58)
half the time it's covered by snow or (56:56 - 57:00)
rain so what do i know (56:58 - 57:03)
[Laughter] (57:00 - 57:03)
yeah (57:06 - 57:09)
i i (57:07 - 57:11)
i don't hate that they have unique (57:09 - 57:13)
evolution methods (57:11 - 57:16)
i hate that it is (57:13 - 57:16)
sometimes so obscure (57:17 - 57:22)
and there's nothing really in game (57:19 - 57:23)
that helps (57:22 - 57:27)
that helps solve the puzzle other than (57:23 - 57:28)
if you randomly try to complete this (57:27 - 57:30)
pokedex (57:28 - 57:32)
it will happen (57:30 - 57:36)
like for stantler (57:32 - 57:36)
you do there is a thing to do agile (57:37 - 57:41)
moves in the pokedex and there is a (57:39 - 57:43)
thing to do the one move that you need (57:41 - 57:45)
but it doesn't link the two together (57:43 - 57:46)
yeah (57:45 - 57:49)
the shield bash or whatever yeah so it's (57:46 - 57:51)
like (57:49 - 57:52)
i mean okay (57:51 - 57:55)
and it it's (57:52 - 57:57)
i i don't think it's as interesting as (57:55 - 57:59)
they think it is or (57:57 - 58:02)
and i will definitely say this (57:59 - 58:04)
i am way too old (58:02 - 58:06)
to care (58:04 - 58:09)
about figuring that puzzle out like i it (58:06 - 58:11)
doesn't interest me enough (58:09 - 58:13)
to be like hmm (58:11 - 58:15)
how do i do this i'm like i know (58:13 - 58:16)
somebody already has it on the internet (58:15 - 58:19)
i'm just gonna go look because i cannot (58:16 - 58:21)
be bothered to figure this out (58:19 - 58:24)
i think there is still like (58:21 - 58:25)
for me (58:24 - 58:27)
i have put (58:25 - 58:29)
whatever 60 hours in this game something (58:27 - 58:31)
like that probably a little bit more (58:29 - 58:33)
um (58:31 - 58:35)
and i have not gone to cerebrum once (58:33 - 58:38)
i have not looked up bulbapedia once (58:35 - 58:40)
i think the only time i looked up (58:38 - 58:42)
something is there was debate in my (58:40 - 58:44)
twitch chat of what (58:42 - 58:45)
rank (58:44 - 58:47)
you need for certain things that happen (58:45 - 58:49)
and i did a quick google search of like (58:47 - 58:51)
what does two star mean what does three (58:49 - 58:52)
star mean what and it was all generic (58:51 - 58:55)
like clickbait articles of like at level (58:52 - 58:57)
two you're level 20 pokemon well yeah (58:55 - 58:59)
yeah that's what they tell you (58:57 - 59:01)
clearly some other things are happening (58:59 - 59:05)
that are not documented anywhere um (59:01 - 59:07)
and i think that like (59:05 - 59:10)
there is still a lot of joy and a lot of (59:07 - 59:12)
discoverability in that sense and i do (59:10 - 59:14)
not want to take anything away from (59:12 - 59:17)
people that are like i do not care about (59:14 - 59:18)
spirit tomb spirits i just want to look (59:17 - 59:20)
up all the air the locations i just want (59:18 - 59:23)
to go there i get it i was a million (59:20 - 59:25)
percent there for you in final fantasy (59:23 - 59:27)
14. they have the same thing you need (59:25 - 59:30)
like 14 aether things and then once you (59:27 - 59:31)
get the 14 ether things you can start (59:30 - 59:34)
flying in the area i don't i don't want (59:31 - 59:35)
to search for them i just want to start (59:34 - 59:37)
flying i get it hey here's the (59:35 - 59:39)
difference (59:37 - 59:41)
final fantasy 14 gives you a compass (59:39 - 59:44)
that you can click and says it's that (59:41 - 59:45)
way (59:44 - 59:47)
there is no compass there is no weird (59:45 - 59:49)
keystone that i can click that can give (59:47 - 59:52)
me an arrow that says oh the wisp is (59:49 - 59:54)
that way that's true you pick it up and (59:52 - 59:57)
it's like there's two left final fantasy (59:54 - 59:59)
at least admits that we're gonna keep (59:57 - 60:00)
you from flying in the zone because we (59:59 - 60:03)
want you on the ground but when you're (60:00 - 60:05)
there we will give you a compass that (60:03 - 60:08)
will guide you to these spots (60:05 - 60:10)
give me a compass (60:08 - 60:12)
give me something where i ha or it says (60:10 - 60:17)
go 50 well north so pro tip um (60:12 - 60:21)
when you've gotten braviary to fly over (60:17 - 60:23)
areas if you fly over at night it's (60:21 - 60:25)
easier to see the wisps on this oh yeah (60:23 - 60:28)
it's way easier to see at night yeah (60:25 - 60:30)
but still give me a compass (60:28 - 60:32)
i think they handled the unknown stuff (60:30 - 60:33)
good (60:32 - 60:36)
yeah like you can like they i think they (60:33 - 60:38)
handle the unknown stuff better than the (60:36 - 60:41)
wisp stuff because the wisp is (60:38 - 60:41)
good luck finding them (60:41 - 60:45)
and you i guess you could see some of (60:43 - 60:47)
them early and then mark them on your (60:45 - 60:49)
map and then come back when you have the (60:47 - 60:51)
appropriate tools to come back to i (60:49 - 60:52)
didn't really think of that until like (60:51 - 60:53)
two days ago (60:52 - 60:55)
now i don't think they appear until you (60:53 - 60:58)
get the stone (60:55 - 61:00)
no no no i mean like when you when you (60:58 - 61:02)
first unlock the whips wisps you will (61:00 - 61:04)
see some that you can't get access to (61:02 - 61:06)
okay so you could like use one of your (61:04 - 61:08)
markers on the map to mark it so you (61:06 - 61:10)
know to come back later i don't know how (61:08 - 61:12)
i don't know what (61:10 - 61:14)
you know how people are using their maps (61:12 - 61:15)
some people probably aren't using them (61:14 - 61:17)
at all besides just to like use the flag (61:15 - 61:19)
but you could be like hey there's an (61:17 - 61:22)
alpha here mark it don't remember it (61:19 - 61:25)
um (61:22 - 61:26)
but at least with the unknowns you can (61:25 - 61:28)
go in the decks and then each unknown (61:26 - 61:30)
has like a hint of where they are which (61:28 - 61:32)
is like pretty clever and again i think (61:30 - 61:34)
that's i like that i think it's cute i (61:32 - 61:35)
think that's fun for people who want (61:34 - 61:37)
that sense of discovery if you are one (61:35 - 61:38)
of those people that do not care about (61:37 - 61:40)
that sense of discovery you just want (61:38 - 61:41)
the answers to move on (61:40 - 61:43)
that's cool too (61:41 - 61:44)
um (61:43 - 61:46)
but i think i think that goes back to (61:44 - 61:48)
the evolving stuff is like (61:46 - 61:50)
you can't you don't even have that (61:48 - 61:51)
option of sense of discovery because (61:50 - 61:53)
like nowhere like you're never going to (61:51 - 61:56)
figure out (61:53 - 61:59)
with like a pokemon like rodriguez (61:56 - 62:01)
there's no way you could accidentally (61:59 - 62:03)
stumble upon that evolution and no one (62:01 - 62:05)
in that video game is ever going to tell (62:03 - 62:06)
you how to do it (62:05 - 62:10)
so you have to look it up yeah (62:06 - 62:10)
um (62:10 - 62:13)
i i want to say one thing that i do (62:13 - 62:17)
really love (62:15 - 62:20)
i love the satchel sascha system (62:17 - 62:23)
there are my joy is turning on the (62:20 - 62:24)
internet (62:23 - 62:29)
pulling it up and going around (62:24 - 62:29)
each little region and (62:29 - 62:33)
saving people's things to send back to (62:31 - 62:35)
them it's like my zen moment when i (62:33 - 62:37)
don't want to do anything else in the (62:35 - 62:38)
game or i'm frustrated with hunting (62:37 - 62:40)
something i'm like that's it i'm (62:38 - 62:42)
searching for people's satchels (62:40 - 62:44)
and i just sleep my internet on all the (62:42 - 62:46)
time yeah i have mine on all the time (62:44 - 62:46)
too (62:46 - 62:48)
yeah i mean i but there's times when i'm (62:46 - 62:50)
like i'm just i'm not gonna collect i (62:48 - 62:52)
need to focus on on (62:50 - 62:54)
this outbreak or i just need to get this (62:52 - 62:56)
mission done but if i'm like i just (62:54 - 62:58)
can't with this game right now (62:56 - 63:02)
my happy place is collecting satchels (62:58 - 63:04)
fantastic and going to and i've been (63:02 - 63:06)
knocked out twice thank you the people (63:04 - 63:08)
who have rescued my satchel (63:06 - 63:11)
brought it back to me i appreciate you i (63:08 - 63:15)
tried but i couldn't get to it (63:11 - 63:15)
the satchel thing is really really cool (63:16 - 63:19)
i like it a lot i love it it makes you (63:18 - 63:22)
actually feel like (63:19 - 63:22)
even though i can't see you it's nice to (63:23 - 63:28)
know that you're part of my survey corps (63:25 - 63:30)
i'm not aware (63:28 - 63:31)
how it works because when i've lost the (63:30 - 63:33)
satchel (63:31 - 63:34)
i'm like hey twitch chat go get my (63:33 - 63:36)
satchel and like five people in twitch (63:34 - 63:39)
chat will be like i got it (63:36 - 63:41)
but it only is returned by one person (63:39 - 63:44)
yeah i think it i think there's a lag of (63:41 - 63:47)
it being there for people to collect (63:44 - 63:49)
i think like it there was one satchel (63:47 - 63:51)
that i could not find and i think (63:49 - 63:53)
somebody had collected it but it was (63:51 - 63:55)
still in my list but it was nowhere in (63:53 - 63:57)
the world (63:55 - 63:58)
so i think it just takes time for it to (63:57 - 64:01)
update that this has been collected (63:58 - 64:03)
um and if everybody goes at the same (64:01 - 64:05)
time like the servers aren't going to be (64:03 - 64:06)
like (64:05 - 64:08)
uh don't reward anybody or reward the (64:06 - 64:10)
person who got it in two seconds before (64:08 - 64:12)
i think they just give everybody the (64:10 - 64:13)
words and then whoever (64:12 - 64:16)
it picks sends it back to you (64:13 - 64:20)
got it but i i love that system i love (64:16 - 64:23)
how relaxed that makes me because i'm (64:20 - 64:25)
like i want to see where you died (64:23 - 64:28)
oh you were killed by an alpha over here (64:25 - 64:30)
i see what happened (64:28 - 64:33)
now i have found some where i'm like (64:30 - 64:36)
how how could you have died (64:33 - 64:37)
did you jump off a cliff (64:36 - 64:40)
what happened here the story doesn't (64:37 - 64:42)
make sense (64:40 - 64:44)
i'm intrigued how next to the camp you (64:42 - 64:47)
died (64:44 - 64:47)
look if you just hit that bravery button (64:47 - 64:52)
and you fall straight down without (64:49 - 64:55)
hitting that bravery button again (64:52 - 64:57)
look i thought you know i thought a (64:55 - 64:59)
certain pokemon could survive a very fal (64:57 - 65:02)
vlog jump (64:59 - 65:02)
they could not (65:02 - 65:05)
i needed to know though (65:05 - 65:10)
you didn't (65:07 - 65:10)
uh question the week (65:11 - 65:15)
uh okay (65:14 - 65:18)
what's the question what's the question (65:15 - 65:22)
the question of the week (65:18 - 65:22)
uh this is from brandon what are your (65:23 - 65:29)
big plans for the 500th episode of the (65:26 - 65:32)
podcast it doesn't happen every day (65:29 - 65:32)
i mean i got no plans (65:32 - 65:36)
i have been only talking to this to you (65:34 - 65:38)
about this for two months (65:36 - 65:40)
please (65:38 - 65:44)
i believe nick is working on new music (65:40 - 65:46)
although i don't know if it's done yet (65:44 - 65:48)
um (65:46 - 65:50)
and i believe we're gonna be doing a (65:48 - 65:52)
live episode on (65:50 - 65:55)
sunday so it'll be the same as as this (65:52 - 65:58)
it'll just be on twitch (65:55 - 65:59)
um (65:58 - 66:01)
so you can catch it live and if you can (65:59 - 66:04)
introduce the new co-hosts live (66:01 - 66:07)
yeah correct okay finally (66:04 - 66:10)
we are replacing greg and will (66:07 - 66:12)
it'll be a great you know 500 more (66:10 - 66:13)
episodes (66:12 - 66:16)
new era new era yes (66:13 - 66:18)
why are we being replaced and not the (66:16 - 66:21)
weakest link which is you (66:18 - 66:24)
oh like that show yeah we bring the fire (66:21 - 66:26)
every week and you wake up stumbling to (66:24 - 66:29)
the office and like i'm here (66:26 - 66:31)
hey look somebody has to edit this show (66:29 - 66:35)
look i i know 50 editors (66:31 - 66:37)
it's not this is not a hardship for me (66:35 - 66:39)
to find an editor (66:37 - 66:41)
uh so yeah that's our plan is uh we'll (66:39 - 66:43)
we'll be doing this episode next week (66:41 - 66:46)
but it'll specif specifically be live on (66:43 - 66:46)
twitch (66:46 - 66:48)
so if you want to come through (66:46 - 66:50)
watch it live we'll be taking questions (66:48 - 66:52)
from twitch chat near the end this will (66:50 - 66:54)
be a little bit more of an interactive (66:52 - 66:57)
show give that a try uh (66:54 - 66:58)
it's something that you know people are (66:57 - 67:00)
like now that you do video podcasts or (66:58 - 67:01)
you can do live podcasts and it's like (67:00 - 67:03)
no because there's like (67:01 - 67:04)
so many more things that can go wrong (67:03 - 67:07)
with the live podcast right and there's (67:04 - 67:09)
so much more setup i think the last time (67:07 - 67:11)
we did a live one i made a swear (67:09 - 67:12)
accidentally (67:11 - 67:14)
but live theater is exciting for the (67:12 - 67:17)
things that can go wrong (67:14 - 67:19)
that's true (67:17 - 67:20)
um it's just it's just a lot more work (67:19 - 67:23)
and until we can streamline that like my (67:20 - 67:24)
number one focus has always been the (67:23 - 67:25)
audio show (67:24 - 67:27)
and so it's like can we can we do a (67:25 - 67:31)
video podcast without the audio show (67:27 - 67:34)
taking a hit in any type of quality and (67:31 - 67:37)
it's like can we do a live video podcast (67:34 - 67:39)
without the video podcast taking a hit (67:37 - 67:41)
and the audio podcast taking ahead so (67:39 - 67:42)
it's like (67:41 - 67:43)
at the end of the day it's (67:42 - 67:45)
can we make sure the live can we make (67:43 - 67:47)
sure the audio only show is as good as (67:45 - 67:49)
possible and if we add on these other (67:47 - 67:50)
things does that ruin the audio only (67:49 - 67:52)
show and if yes then we can't do it (67:50 - 67:54)
until we find ways to make sure that (67:52 - 67:59)
that stuff is as good as it can be (67:54 - 67:59)
um (68:00 - 68:04)
another question from kevin who is your (68:02 - 68:06)
favorite jesuian ancestor that you've (68:04 - 68:09)
met (68:06 - 68:09)
let me go first okay i'm not sure (68:09 - 68:15)
if i've actually met them and it seemed (68:13 - 68:18)
very very strange to me and you guys may (68:15 - 68:20)
know more but (68:18 - 68:23)
when i finished section three (68:20 - 68:25)
i went back to commander kamado or (68:23 - 68:26)
whatever (68:25 - 68:29)

z-i-s-u (72:18 - 72:21)
but who runs the training ground (72:24 - 72:28)

sees who (72:33 - 72:38)
no (72:36 - 72:40)
zizu is the one who stands at the top of (72:38 - 72:41)
the training ground the whole time you (72:40 - 72:43)
walk up to her if she wants if you want (72:41 - 72:45)
to master a move and you give her an (72:43 - 72:47)
item the little mastery item (72:45 - 72:49)

character a lot too (72:57 - 73:00)
i mean i like all the i like almost all (73:02 - 73:05)
the characters there's one character (73:04 - 73:08)
that i absolutely (73:05 - 73:08)
do not like (73:09 - 73:15)
in any way shape or form it is a spoiler (73:10 - 73:17)
and i do not like this person (73:15 - 73:19)
at all (73:17 - 73:20)
well we'll just have to answer this (73:19 - 73:25)
question again on the thursday program (73:20 - 73:25)
will pokemon of the week (73:35 - 73:40)
all right last week's pokemon (73:37 - 73:41)
shouldn't have been that hard but i (73:40 - 73:43)
don't know it's real short this pokemon (73:41 - 73:45)
whose pre-evolution had to be brought to (73:43 - 73:48)
the farthest across the pokey earth to (73:45 - 73:51)
arrive in his sui has a new form that (73:48 - 73:53)
now has a type weakness to its (73:51 - 73:56)
compatriot that originally was strong (73:53 - 73:59)
against (73:56 - 73:59)
you guys are thinking way too hard (74:04 - 74:08)
wait is that again (74:07 - 74:11)
this pokemon whose pre-evolution had to (74:08 - 74:13)
be brought the farthest across the poke (74:11 - 74:16)
earth to arrive in hissui has a new form (74:13 - 74:18)
that now has type weakness to its (74:16 - 74:21)
compatriot that it originally was strong (74:18 - 74:23)
against (74:21 - 74:25)
who had to travel the farthest to get to (74:23 - 74:28)
his part that i'm thinking (74:25 - 74:32)
all right if hawaii is close to japan it (74:28 - 74:34)
would be a little short isn't it (74:32 - 74:35)
no (74:34 - 74:37)
if hawaii is close to japan that gives (74:35 - 74:39)
you one (74:37 - 74:43)
if johto is in japan that gives you two (74:39 - 74:46)
if unova is on the east coast of the (74:43 - 74:49)
united states that's a really long way (74:46 - 74:52)
to travel (74:49 - 74:52)
is it oshawott it's (74:53 - 75:00)
[Music] (74:57 - 75:00)
it used to be strong against (75:01 - 75:05)
uh (75:04 - 75:07)
what's the final evolution of tepig of (75:05 - 75:11)
course it goes right out of my (75:07 - 75:11)
i was thinking against the ones that in (75:15 - 75:21)
this region i'm like it's not though (75:17 - 75:22)
there's no there's no ember in this (75:21 - 75:25)
region i know it's (75:22 - 75:28)
lil again (75:25 - 75:28)

samurai sam rod samrat's due (75:35 - 75:40)
did not change (75:37 - 75:40)
that is the one that i did not look up (75:43 - 75:48)
until after i got in credits (75:46 - 75:51)
like i didn't know it's typing at all i (75:48 - 75:54)
didn't do any of the typings like no i (75:51 - 75:56)

don't worry because i got i (75:56 - 76:00)
was like okay now that i've gotten (75:58 - 76:01)
credits i need to know (76:00 - 76:04)
what everything became (76:01 - 76:06)
uh so that was the one i didn't look up (76:04 - 76:08)
until like (76:06 - 76:10)
two days ago where i'm like okay i want (76:08 - 76:13)
to know what these are (76:10 - 76:13)
uh well what did you think of the uh (76:15 - 76:20)
hissuian samurai (76:17 - 76:23)
i mean i didn't pick it (76:20 - 76:25)
okay here's my question did we all pick (76:23 - 76:28)
cyndaquil i picked cyndaquil (76:25 - 76:30)
i was going to pick rowlet and then i (76:28 - 76:33)
did not like the final evolution so that (76:30 - 76:36)
has stepped away yep same (76:33 - 76:37)
i don't know if i love any of their (76:36 - 76:39)
final evolutions they're fine oh i love (76:37 - 76:43)
thai flu shots so much oh yeah (76:39 - 76:46)
absolutely i am (76:43 - 76:52)
so sold on this typhlosion i'm like (76:46 - 76:53)
i've got i got (76:52 - 76:57)
half a pokemon team that's ghost fire (76:53 - 76:57)
at this point i like (76:58 - 77:02)
when it evolved i was like huh and then (77:00 - 77:05)
i saw in the over world when the flames (77:02 - 77:07)

uh so (77:22 - 77:27)
regular samurai shuffle is very good (77:24 - 77:30)
i don't know how i feel about the shiny (77:27 - 77:32)
the shiny is the same color as the (77:30 - 77:34)
hassuwian form (77:32 - 77:36)
kinda that's kind of what they did for (77:34 - 77:39)
all the final forms yeah (77:36 - 77:39)
it's just like that darker blue (77:41 - 77:45)
at (77:47 - 77:52)
2.099 seconds samurai has the longest (77:49 - 77:56)
cry of any starter who's timing this (77:52 - 77:58)
bulbapedia is typing this (77:56 - 78:00)
samurai is the only fully evolved water (77:58 - 78:02)
starter pokemon that is not in water egg (78:00 - 78:05)
group one (78:02 - 78:05)
that's all you got that's all the (78:11 - 78:14)
trivias (78:13 - 78:16)
that's not great unless you want to know (78:14 - 78:18)
that samurai appears in pokemon battle (78:16 - 78:20)
chess bw version it acts as a bishop (78:18 - 78:22)
piece in chess but it can only move one (78:20 - 78:25)
square directly (78:22 - 78:25)
that's how forward work that's some (78:25 - 78:32)
that's that's trivia for you (78:29 - 78:32)
all right let's do next week's one (78:33 - 78:38)
okay (78:36 - 78:40)
i typically do not use mythical pokemon (78:38 - 78:42)
in my playthroughs of pokemon games but (78:40 - 78:44)
i recently decided to have one on my (78:42 - 78:47)
team i have been fascinated by this (78:44 - 78:49)
pokemon since it was related to probably (78:47 - 78:52)
my favorite pokemon game of all time but (78:49 - 78:54)
i had been unable to obtain it in my (78:52 - 78:56)
playthrough of that game partially (78:54 - 78:58)
because i did not know how partially (78:56 - 79:00)
because i did not have access to two (78:58 - 79:02)
nintendo ds (79:00 - 79:04)
as i have been using this pokemon i have (79:02 - 79:07)
become increasingly disappointed that in (79:04 - 79:10)
the game that i am playing sixty percent (79:07 - 79:12)
of its moves are all water type and the (79:10 - 79:15)
bug fairy normal poison and psychic type (79:12 - 79:19)
moves it learns are all non-damaging (79:15 - 79:21)
in a different recent game it has access (79:19 - 79:24)
to psychic and fairy moves that actually (79:21 - 79:25)
cause damage (79:24 - 79:28)
in both the plasma storm and primal (79:25 - 79:31)
clash tcg expansions this pokemon's card (79:28 - 79:33)
included an attack that would allow the (79:31 - 79:36)
player to retrieve water energies from (79:33 - 79:38)
their discard (79:36 - 79:39)
there you go we're going more classic on (79:38 - 79:41)

legends i did make a whole youtube video (80:56 - 81:00)
about it i promise you my youtube video (80:58 - 81:01)
is better than everyone else's youtube (81:00 - 81:03)
video because they don't tell you about (81:01 - 81:07)
the save issue that can happen (81:03 - 81:08)
i know i know the common thing is like (81:07 - 81:10)
hey if you see a shiny save in front of (81:08 - 81:12)
it (81:10 - 81:13)
doesn't technically work that way in (81:12 - 81:15)
outbreak it does work that way outbreaks (81:13 - 81:16)
unless your outbreak is near the end and (81:15 - 81:17)
then it doesn't and then you lose the (81:16 - 81:19)
shiny and then you'll probably be like (81:17 - 81:21)
why did i lose the shiny i made a video (81:19 - 81:24)
explaining why you would lose the shiny (81:21 - 81:25)
and where you should save so that does (81:24 - 81:27)
not (81:25 - 81:29)
happen full proof (81:27 - 81:31)
some would say (81:29 - 81:33)
oh wait what was the word i used on it (81:31 - 81:35)
fail proof fail proof get better luck (81:33 - 81:36)
noob (81:35 - 81:39)
yeah get better luck get luckier (81:36 - 81:40)
noob (81:39 - 81:42)
um hey there's also a mission that will (81:40 - 81:44)
ask for a fire type pokemon near the end (81:42 - 81:46)
of the game and i gave them my shiny (81:44 - 81:47)
ponyta because i thought it would be (81:46 - 81:48)
like the shiny wormpole and it would (81:47 - 81:50)
like stand next to the person (81:48 - 81:52)
uh he he just puts it in his pocket (81:50 - 81:56)
you'll never see that shiny (81:52 - 81:56)
[Laughter] (81:57 - 82:04)
real big heads up on that one near the (82:02 - 82:07)
end of the game right there (82:04 - 82:07)
literally almost every single npc will (82:09 - 82:14)
take your pokemon and then put them next (82:12 - 82:18)
to them this joker out by the fireplace (82:14 - 82:20)
