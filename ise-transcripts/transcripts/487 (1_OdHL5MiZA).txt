every winter (1:41 - 1:45)
i remember oh that's right i've shoved (1:43 - 1:47)
my gloves into my heavy jacket pocket (1:45 - 1:49)
which is why i can never find them (1:47 - 1:50)
because they're in that heavy jacket and (1:49 - 1:52)
then i forget that they're there and i (1:50 - 1:53)
take out the heavy jacket and i go (1:52 - 1:55)
there's there's my gloves what we really (1:53 - 1:57)
need to do at some point because this is (1:55 - 2:00)
truly uh hashtag minnesota things (1:57 - 2:02)

okay well we can talk about the cold and (2:22 - 2:27)
being outside a little bit later this (2:25 - 2:30)
podcast uh greg will and i did go to the (2:27 - 2:33)
safari zone in person in (2:30 - 2:36)
saint louis missouri (2:33 - 2:37)
and we'll talk about that a little bit (2:36 - 2:39)
later but we're going to start off with (2:37 - 2:40)
some (2:39 - 2:43)
the news that everyone wants the diamond (2:40 - 2:44)
and pearl stuff we're going to start off (2:43 - 2:46)
with that (2:44 - 2:46)
okay so this is part of it there's a lot (2:47 - 2:52)
is there i i don't know it's kind of not (2:50 - 2:54)
a lot when you break it down but (2:52 - 2:56)
there was a there was a new trailer (2:54 - 2:57)
um (2:56 - 3:00)
i still can't say this this word (2:57 - 3:01)
introducing (3:00 - 3:03)
ramanus park (3:01 - 3:05)
how do you say it (3:03 - 3:08)
ramanas ramanas (3:05 - 3:11)
park is it r a all a's (3:08 - 3:13)
r-a-m-a-n-a like banana romana (3:11 - 3:17)
[Laughter] (3:13 - 3:19)
ramona except you changed that middle o (3:17 - 3:20)
to an a ramana (3:19 - 3:21)
yeah (3:20 - 3:22)
so (3:21 - 3:25)
romana romana's park in pokemon (3:22 - 3:27)
brilliant diamond and pokemon shining (3:25 - 3:28)
pearl (3:27 - 3:32)
so this park replaced the pow park (3:28 - 3:36)
which would let you take pokemon from (3:32 - 3:38)
um what gen 3 (3:36 - 3:41)
and then suck them in yeah (3:38 - 3:43)
so that's that's what they finally did (3:41 - 3:46)
with pal park so now we know that (3:43 - 3:48)
but what does that mean the pokemon (3:46 - 3:49)
company international and nintendo (3:48 - 3:50)
revealed new details about how to (3:49 - 3:52)
encounter legendary and mythical pokemon (3:50 - 3:54)
in pokemon brilliant diamond and shining (3:52 - 3:55)
pearl available on november 19th that's (3:54 - 3:56)
this week (3:55 - 3:58)
exclusively on the nintendo switch new (3:56 - 4:00)
to pokemon diamond i'm just gonna say (3:58 - 4:02)
diamond pearl uh (4:00 - 4:04)
new to pokemon diamond and pearl (4:02 - 4:06)
romana's park is a facility that players (4:04 - 4:08)
can visit after entering the hall of (4:06 - 4:10)
fame so you have to beat the game (4:08 - 4:12)
there are caves dotted throughout the (4:10 - 4:14)
park and the chamber inside them are (4:12 - 4:17)
filled with a mysterious atmosphere (4:14 - 4:18)
trainers can view (4:17 - 4:19)
a new video (4:18 - 4:22)
that was the one minute trailer (4:19 - 4:24)
so there is something called slates and (4:22 - 4:25)
they are the key to encountering (4:24 - 4:27)
legendary pokemon inside the rooms of (4:25 - 4:30)
romanus park are pedestals and it said (4:27 - 4:32)
that that if a player inserts a slate (4:30 - 4:34)
into the corresponding pedestal a (4:32 - 4:36)
legendary pokemon will appear it is (4:34 - 4:39)
unclear exactly how these slates can be (4:36 - 4:41)
obtained so players will have to do some (4:39 - 4:43)
research while exploring the central (4:41 - 4:45)
region (4:43 - 4:45)
you mean like the arceus plates (4:46 - 4:49)
that we've had for years and years and (4:48 - 4:51)
years so i don't (4:49 - 4:53)
i don't know if you like slowed down the (4:51 - 4:54)
trailer will or saw but these the little (4:53 - 4:56)
plates look like little game boy (4:54 - 4:57)
cartridges yeah i mean i've seen the (4:56 - 5:00)
artwork it's very very cute (4:57 - 5:00)
but yeah they only show it for like a (5:01 - 5:05)
hot second (5:02 - 5:06)
um (5:05 - 5:09)
this is them okay so this is what this (5:06 - 5:11)
is let's back up for a second this is (5:09 - 5:13)
them saying this is post game (5:11 - 5:14)
yeah (5:13 - 5:16)
like with when we were one or two weeks (5:14 - 5:19)
out from let's go pikachu let's go eevee (5:16 - 5:20)
they were like look at these master (5:19 - 5:23)
trainer battles you can 1v1 and earn a (5:20 - 5:25)
title and we're like oh that seems cool (5:23 - 5:26)
on paper and then in execution it was (5:25 - 5:27)
like (5:26 - 5:28)
wow (5:27 - 5:32)
protect toxic protect protect (5:28 - 5:35)
okay i won (5:32 - 5:35)
like probably the hardest master trainer (5:35 - 5:40)
battle in (5:37 - 5:40)
in let's go pikachu let's go eevee was (5:41 - 5:44)
probably like (5:43 - 5:47)
the metapod one (5:44 - 5:49)
yeah because you can only use harden (5:47 - 5:51)
and it wasn't even hard it was just like (5:49 - 5:52)
30 minutes (5:51 - 5:54)
yeah no i mean eventually somebody runs (5:52 - 5:56)
out and struggles so (5:54 - 5:57)
yeah (5:56 - 5:59)
no you caught a caterpie that new tackle (5:57 - 6:00)
then you if you just caught metapod you (5:59 - 6:02)
were done for well that's the point of (6:00 - 6:04)
the master battle it's metapod versus (6:02 - 6:08)
metapod caught in the wild (6:04 - 6:08)
there were a couple there were a couple (6:09 - 6:12)
of those battles that were okay yeah i (6:10 - 6:14)
didn't do a lot of them i kind of got (6:12 - 6:16)
burned out (6:14 - 6:17)
after the first and i'm like i have to (6:16 - 6:20)
do this for everything no i'm done (6:17 - 6:22)
um (6:20 - 6:22)
i (6:23 - 6:25)
i don't want to talk about like spoilers (6:24 - 6:27)
or leaks (6:25 - 6:28)
but it it's (6:27 - 6:29)
very safe to say at this point there's (6:28 - 6:32)
no like battle frontier or (6:29 - 6:35)
platinum whatever they added in platinum (6:32 - 6:37)
because one they would have showed it (6:35 - 6:38)
but two (6:37 - 6:40)
i feel like we we know now that people (6:38 - 6:42)
have gotten the game early and have (6:40 - 6:44)
kind of clarified there's there's no (6:42 - 6:46)
platinum post game (6:44 - 6:48)
yeah i thought you said there was i (6:46 - 6:50)
thought the giratina stuff well this (6:48 - 6:51)
this is this we i don't know about the (6:50 - 6:52)
guarantee and stuff i don't know if (6:51 - 6:54)
you're actually going to distortion (6:52 - 6:55)
world i don't know that i didn't look (6:54 - 6:56)
that up (6:55 - 6:59)
oh dang (6:56 - 6:59)
but i think you're right if they were (7:06 - 7:09)
going to do battle frontier they would (7:07 - 7:11)
have mentioned it but yeah (7:09 - 7:13)
i mean it's a weird thing to like (7:11 - 7:14)
have hidden (7:13 - 7:17)
at this point if they're gonna add it (7:14 - 7:20)
i i don't know i don't know if this is (7:17 - 7:22)
the only post game like there could be (7:20 - 7:24)
other (7:22 - 7:26)
parts but i i do think we can probably (7:24 - 7:28)
write the battle frontier off they (7:26 - 7:30)
haven't it didn't bring battle frontier (7:28 - 7:31)
back for aorus i don't know that they're (7:30 - 7:33)
gonna bring it back here (7:31 - 7:36)
and not have mentioned it like after (7:33 - 7:37)
this test your (7:36 - 7:40)
skill at blah blah (7:37 - 7:42)
yeah i mean maybe they (7:40 - 7:44)
have dlc planned for diamond and pearl i (7:42 - 7:48)
don't know it's possible uh (7:44 - 7:48)
like if if anything they've been very (7:48 - 7:53)
good at throwing surprises our way who (7:51 - 7:54)
knew that after (7:53 - 7:56)
sun and moon (7:54 - 7:58)
we would get another sun and moon that (7:56 - 8:00)
was almost identical and then who knew (7:58 - 8:03)
after that we would get a remake of gen (8:00 - 8:05)
1 which we've already had remade (8:03 - 8:06)
and then (8:05 - 8:09)
we got our first pokemon game on this (8:06 - 8:11)
our first new generation on the switch (8:09 - 8:15)
and that generation had dlc so (8:11 - 8:18)
we also didn't expect a (8:15 - 8:20)
game (8:18 - 8:22)
a main series game not being made by (8:20 - 8:25)
game freak to also come out (8:22 - 8:26)
so there could be dlc there could be (8:25 - 8:28)
like uh i don't know (8:26 - 8:31)
battle frontier or extra legendaries or (8:28 - 8:32)
uh (8:31 - 8:34)
extra isla who knows there could be (8:32 - 8:36)
nothing to like i guess i have no (8:34 - 8:38)
expectations i do (8:36 - 8:39)
so going back to like encountering (8:38 - 8:41)
legendary pokemon after you beat the (8:39 - 8:42)
hall of fame which is saying like once (8:41 - 8:44)
you beat the game um (8:42 - 8:46)
it seems like there's at least something (8:44 - 8:47)
new there (8:46 - 8:49)
because there is this not the struggle (8:47 - 8:51)
but this this ongoing conversation of (8:49 - 8:53)
people being like (8:51 - 8:56)
i want to relive the game that i had as (8:53 - 8:57)
a child (8:56 - 8:59)
which is a lot of remakes like that's (8:57 - 9:01)
not exclusive to pokemon (8:59 - 9:03)
and then there's the there's my side of (9:01 - 9:05)
the conversation which is like look i've (9:03 - 9:06)
played this stuff before give me (9:05 - 9:07)
something new (9:06 - 9:10)
and i feel like a lot of these (9:07 - 9:11)
game developers have to find a balance (9:10 - 9:14)
of like okay well we want to capture (9:11 - 9:16)
your childhood but we also want to give (9:14 - 9:18)
you something new so this is the (9:16 - 9:20)
something new at least for me is okay (9:18 - 9:21)
i'm gonna beat the game (9:20 - 9:24)
where are these plates gonna be how fun (9:21 - 9:28)
is it to find and get these plates (9:24 - 9:28)
well i i mean i have a strong (9:28 - 9:33)
feeling post game (9:30 - 9:34)
either (9:33 - 9:36)
the plates are gonna be added to the (9:34 - 9:39)
digging game in the underground (9:36 - 9:41)
or they're going to be part of when you (9:39 - 9:44)
put certain statues up they'll appear in (9:41 - 9:45)
those wild areas under certain (9:44 - 9:47)
circumstances like i haven't they've (9:45 - 9:49)
been really pushing that underground (9:47 - 9:51)
heavy the fact that they call them (9:49 - 9:53)
plates and used to find (9:51 - 9:56)
bits of the other plates in (9:53 - 9:58)
the digging game before (9:56 - 10:00)
i have a feeling they're going to be in (9:58 - 10:02)
there somehow but it may be controlled (10:00 - 10:04)
by the statues you put in your secret (10:02 - 10:06)
base like (10:04 - 10:07)
those are the only things that they've (10:06 - 10:09)
sort of kept (10:07 - 10:12)
in the same conversation so (10:09 - 10:14)
post game seems to be a lot of put the (10:12 - 10:15)
statues in (10:14 - 10:18)
change the habitat and then like this is (10:15 - 10:20)
also post game so i have a feeling (10:18 - 10:22)
they're they're pretty connected somehow (10:20 - 10:24)
what the exact connection is i don't (10:22 - 10:26)
know but i (10:24 - 10:29)
i would not put it past them (10:26 - 10:31)
to put them behind that frustrating (10:29 - 10:33)
digging game i mean we could hope that (10:31 - 10:36)
digging game is better this time (10:33 - 10:38)
nothing that they've shown of it (10:36 - 10:40)
suggests that it is better (10:38 - 10:42)
it looks exactly the same it is (10:40 - 10:43)
interesting that they're trying to (10:42 - 10:46)
preserve that park even though it has no (10:43 - 10:48)
purpose any longer right yeah not (10:46 - 10:50)
transferring pokemon in from another (10:48 - 10:52)
generation so what can we do with that (10:50 - 10:55)
park oh let's make it (10:52 - 10:57)
this new unique feature (10:55 - 10:59)
i may like that they're doing something (10:57 - 11:01)
with it i i did half think (10:59 - 11:03)
are they just going to cut out of the (11:01 - 11:05)
game is it going to be there so having (11:03 - 11:08)
it be there and change to (11:05 - 11:10)
another way to hunt legendary and (11:08 - 11:16)
mythical pokemon i it's cool i like it (11:10 - 11:17)
uh legendary pokemon players can (11:16 - 11:19)
encounter some legendary pokemon can (11:17 - 11:21)
only be encountered in one game version (11:19 - 11:23)
or another but players can still try to (11:21 - 11:24)
get them on their team through other (11:23 - 11:26)
means such as trading with other players (11:24 - 11:29)
in in brilliant diamond it is possible (11:26 - 11:31)
to encounter raikou entei and suicune (11:29 - 11:33)
and ho in pokemon shining pearl it is (11:31 - 11:36)
possible to uh encounter articuno zapdos (11:33 - 11:39)
moltres and lugia (11:36 - 11:41)
i think since then nintendo not the (11:39 - 11:42)
pokemon company i think it was nintendo (11:41 - 11:44)
tweeted that mewtwo was going to be in (11:42 - 11:47)
diamond and rayquaza was going to be in (11:44 - 11:48)
pearl (11:47 - 11:50)
that's not equal (11:48 - 11:52)
definitely not that's true also they (11:50 - 11:55)
have not mentioned kroger and (11:52 - 11:57)
groupon um i'm assuming those are going (11:55 - 11:59)
to be split (11:57 - 12:02)
or not available (11:59 - 12:04)
how do you do rayquaza and not kyogre (12:02 - 12:07)
groudon very easily pretty easy raymond (12:04 - 12:08)
showed up for the party and the other (12:07 - 12:12)
two did it's like nah i have things to (12:08 - 12:14)
do (12:12 - 12:14)
this okay i know we always talk about (12:15 - 12:19)
like hey this is these are the thoughts (12:17 - 12:22)
that happen you know on socials or (12:19 - 12:25)
in our communities but it's it's so (12:22 - 12:27)
funny seeing people be upset about being (12:25 - 12:28)
like (12:27 - 12:30)
i can't get all of them (12:28 - 12:32)
because (12:30 - 12:33)
you mean one of the games versus the (12:32 - 12:37)
other one yeah since day one since (12:33 - 12:40)
day one of 25 years ago you also could (12:37 - 12:42)
get all of them because this wasn't (12:40 - 12:44)
sword and shield even in the dynamics (12:42 - 12:46)
advantage (12:44 - 12:48)
that's what i'm thinking too is like (12:46 - 12:49)
i don't know (12:48 - 12:51)
why this comes as a surprise this is (12:49 - 12:54)
definitely not like a sudden heel turn (12:51 - 12:56)
by the nintendo company like (12:54 - 12:58)
you could get everything in one game (12:56 - 13:01)
before but no you can't (12:58 - 13:04)
sudden twist we're evil now i i want to (13:01 - 13:06)
find these people and be like (13:04 - 13:09)
did you not play ultrasound ultramoon (13:06 - 13:11)
where all of these were sitting at the (13:09 - 13:13)
end of the game did you not play omega (13:11 - 13:15)
ruby alpha sapphire when all of these (13:13 - 13:16)
were sitting at the end of the game did (13:15 - 13:18)
you not get the diamond or did you not (13:16 - 13:20)
get the sword and shield dlc where all (13:18 - 13:21)
of these were sitting at the end of the (13:20 - 13:24)
game why are we upset about this do you (13:21 - 13:26)
not play pokemon go i'm swimming in (13:24 - 13:28)
lugia they were handing them out like (13:26 - 13:29)
candy (13:28 - 13:31)
like what (13:29 - 13:32)
like but even in sword and shield the (13:31 - 13:34)
legendaries there were some that you (13:32 - 13:36)
could only get in one versus the other (13:34 - 13:38)
so yeah the l like you had to make a (13:36 - 13:40)
choice between aleki and i mean you can (13:38 - 13:43)
always start not get it no but even even (13:40 - 13:46)
in the the in the adventure (13:43 - 13:47)
adventures or whatever (13:46 - 13:49)
there were some that were version (13:47 - 13:50)
exclusives you had to know somebody who (13:49 - 13:52)
had the other one to invite you to their (13:50 - 13:54)
raid (13:52 - 13:54)
yeah it's just (13:54 - 13:59)
i think it's i i think it's it's funny (13:56 - 14:00)
to see those conversations happen (13:59 - 14:02)
because like we play every pokemon game (14:00 - 14:04)
but it's very clear that these people (14:02 - 14:06)
haven't like if they were complaining (14:04 - 14:08)
about not getting zapdos (14:06 - 14:10)
they i i can't imagine they play pokemon (14:08 - 14:11)
go or (14:10 - 14:14)
they clearly didn't get the dlc to sword (14:11 - 14:16)
and shield right they didn't get ultra (14:14 - 14:17)
sun and moon (14:16 - 14:20)
these are literally people who like (14:17 - 14:22)
diamond and pearl are the only pokemon (14:20 - 14:24)
original diamond pro the only pokemon (14:22 - 14:27)
games they ever played before (14:24 - 14:29)
and they're like oh they they must have (14:27 - 14:31)
fixed this by now yeah they give us all (14:29 - 14:34)
of them yeah they surely will give us (14:31 - 14:36)
everything (14:34 - 14:38)
surely a game that's based on trading (14:36 - 14:40)
with your friend will cut out a core (14:38 - 14:41)
mechanic and give us everything but (14:40 - 14:43)
here's here's the takeaway though i look (14:41 - 14:46)
at this and i go okay cool i don't like (14:43 - 14:50)
i don't care right i i'm i have so many (14:46 - 14:52)
legendary pokemon from the like even (14:50 - 14:54)
with the sword and shield dlc i have not (14:52 - 14:55)
finished dynamics adventure i haven't (14:54 - 14:57)
caught almost all of them because like i (14:55 - 14:58)
don't (14:57 - 14:59)
need them (14:58 - 15:00)
who am i going to do with 18 zechariah (14:59 - 15:02)
like nothing yeah but that's you that's (15:00 - 15:04)
yeah yeah yeah the average player i'm (15:02 - 15:06)
not i'm not the average player so when i (15:04 - 15:08)
read this it doesn't really like sway my (15:06 - 15:09)
decision right like i'm not desperate (15:08 - 15:11)
for articuno i played let's go pikachu i (15:09 - 15:14)
have articuno since you know red and (15:11 - 15:16)
blue (15:14 - 15:16)
but clearly (15:16 - 15:21)
that the pokemon company slash nintendo (15:18 - 15:23)
slash game freak they have done enough (15:21 - 15:25)
market research and they understand (15:23 - 15:27)
customers better than these twitter (15:25 - 15:29)
people or these writer people that they (15:27 - 15:29)
know (15:29 - 15:32)
that not every pokemon player buys every (15:29 - 15:35)
pokemon game and these pokemons to hear (15:32 - 15:37)
still have so much weight in people's (15:35 - 15:40)
decisions like hey even though the (15:37 - 15:43)
hardcore players like me and the people (15:40 - 15:44)
listening to the show they have a (15:43 - 15:46)
million zapdos (15:44 - 15:48)
they're going to buy the game regardless (15:46 - 15:51)
but we know that somebody out there is (15:48 - 15:55)
missing a ho-oh and that once we say (15:51 - 15:56)
ho-oh is in this game that person's (15:55 - 15:57)
gonna be like well that's the game i'm (15:56 - 16:00)
buying like they know that this is still (15:57 - 16:03)
a very important selling feature to (16:00 - 16:06)
the majority of their audience (16:03 - 16:09)
in my opinion (16:06 - 16:09)
i mean you're not wrong and it's not (16:10 - 16:13)
even just the legendaries it's like what (16:11 - 16:14)
are the regular pokemon that are (16:13 - 16:17)
exclusive to each other (16:14 - 16:17)
i mean if you're asking me to choose (16:18 - 16:20)
between an oddish and a bell sprout that (16:19 - 16:23)
decision has been made (16:20 - 16:26)
yeah it's glammy outfit would you stop (16:23 - 16:29)
nobody cares about that stupid cat (16:26 - 16:31)
look forward to online features this is (16:29 - 16:33)
this is this is such a weird press (16:31 - 16:34)
release (16:33 - 16:35)
for players looking forward to playing (16:34 - 16:37)
diamond on pearl and shining (16:35 - 16:39)
diamond diamond pro there will be a (16:37 - 16:41)
software (16:39 - 16:43)
there will be a software update version (16:41 - 16:47)
1.1.0 available november 11th (16:43 - 16:48)
ahead of the game's release with the (16:47 - 16:51)
software update 1.1.0 players will be (16:48 - 16:53)
able to enjoy communication features of (16:51 - 16:55)
the ground underground super contest (16:53 - 16:57)
show and receive items from mystery gift (16:55 - 16:58)
and (16:57 - 16:59)
visit (16:58 - 17:01)
uh romanus park after entering the hall (16:59 - 17:03)
of fame (17:01 - 17:06)
this part of this press release is so (17:03 - 17:07)
weird because the game doesn't come out (17:06 - 17:10)
till 19th and the only thing i can think (17:07 - 17:11)
of is like okay well reviewers have the (17:10 - 17:13)
game early to play but they would just (17:11 - 17:15)
tell those people anyways like hey (17:13 - 17:18)
ign just a heads up we're doing an (17:15 - 17:21)
update like as a person (17:18 - 17:23)
it just seems very weird for them to (17:21 - 17:25)
call that specific thing out but maybe i (17:23 - 17:28)
don't i don't think so i think that (17:25 - 17:30)
by calling it out ahead they they helped (17:28 - 17:31)
stop people was like oh the game was so (17:30 - 17:33)
broken and released they had to do a (17:31 - 17:34)
patch day one (17:33 - 17:36)
like they're getting ahead of it saying (17:34 - 17:37)
we are (17:36 - 17:39)
putting in the patch immediately because (17:37 - 17:40)
we want to make sure that these were (17:39 - 17:42)
working and this is going in so that (17:40 - 17:44)
they can at least have something (17:42 - 17:47)
official out to stop people from (17:44 - 17:49)
it won't let's be real it's not going to (17:47 - 17:52)
stop them but it gives us ammunition to (17:49 - 17:54)
point saying hey this wasn't a mistake (17:52 - 17:56)
their game wasn't broken day one they (17:54 - 17:59)
said they were releasing a patch right (17:56 - 18:01)
yeah it's not unusual for developers to (17:59 - 18:04)
ship a game early because (18:01 - 18:06)
they especially now like make the (18:04 - 18:07)
cartridges and they have to get them (18:06 - 18:09)
overseas and the shipping (18:07 - 18:12)
problem is so bad right now (18:09 - 18:15)
they probably had to ship actual (18:12 - 18:18)
cartridges at the start of summer (18:15 - 18:20)
and be like program it with what we have (18:18 - 18:21)
now (18:20 - 18:22)
because these are the only shipping (18:21 - 18:25)
times we can get the shipping situation (18:22 - 18:27)
is so dire (18:25 - 18:30)
who knows how early they had to actually (18:27 - 18:32)
commit to getting something out so i'm (18:30 - 18:34)
not surprised that there's a patch day (18:32 - 18:35)
one to be like okay (18:34 - 18:36)
we had to put something on those (18:35 - 18:39)
cartridges here's the rest but yeah but (18:36 - 18:42)
even beyond that it like even if the (18:39 - 18:44)
patch solely serves to unlock the online (18:42 - 18:46)
capabilities because they didn't want (18:44 - 18:47)
the reviewers to have the online (18:46 - 18:49)
capabilities it's better to get in front (18:47 - 18:52)
of it and say that's what's happening (18:49 - 18:54)
versus because people don't read (18:52 - 18:57)
it's too it's 20 21 people don't read so (18:54 - 18:59)
if i like (18:57 - 19:01)
get you know my game and i start it up (18:59 - 19:02)
and it's like all right you've got to (19:01 - 19:04)
patch it then all of a sudden it's (19:02 - 19:06)
mystery and speculation of (19:04 - 19:08)
sure what is this yeah what are they (19:06 - 19:11)
patching well and this is not a spoiler (19:08 - 19:12)
but one of the like (19:11 - 19:14)
leaks or what happened when people got (19:12 - 19:16)
the game early is there was no title (19:14 - 19:17)
screen (19:16 - 19:18)
and that was talked about (19:17 - 19:20)
like oh this game doesn't even like (19:18 - 19:23)
there's there's no intro cinematic it's (19:20 - 19:24)
just you turn on the game and then you (19:23 - 19:26)
go like new game (19:24 - 19:30)
um and that's been patched in since (19:26 - 19:30)
and we have that now but it's like yes (19:31 - 19:35)
like no these games ship (19:33 - 19:37)
when people are gonna put together the (19:35 - 19:39)
fact that they have the ability to do (19:37 - 19:40)
patches now (19:39 - 19:43)
so looking for they are going to perhaps (19:40 - 19:45)
keep things (19:43 - 19:49)
out of the game for leakers to have like (19:45 - 19:52)
bad quality so that guys because if a (19:49 - 19:54)
leaker gets it and says oh the game is (19:52 - 19:55)
bad it doesn't have this and doesn't (19:54 - 19:57)
have that and the regular consumer buys (19:55 - 19:58)
it and it (19:57 - 20:00)
suddenly has all those things that (19:58 - 20:03)
leaker just looks bad right like well (20:00 - 20:05)
you have an incomplete copy so you are (20:03 - 20:07)
basing everything off of bad information (20:05 - 20:09)
and it discredits the leaker like it is (20:07 - 20:11)
the benefit of a company in this world (20:09 - 20:14)
of online connectivity to hold stuff (20:11 - 20:16)
back for a patch (20:14 - 20:17)
because (20:16 - 20:19)
it doesn't hurt them if you're buying (20:17 - 20:20)
the game when they want it and they (20:19 - 20:22)
patch it the same day your experience is (20:20 - 20:25)
good if a hacker gets it and gets out (20:22 - 20:27)
flawed data and tries to make a name for (20:25 - 20:29)
themselves off of bad information it (20:27 - 20:32)
only hurts that leaker (20:29 - 20:33)
and (20:32 - 20:36)
and the things that like are missing (20:33 - 20:38)
always make sense why you don't need the (20:36 - 20:40)
titles like the title screen is so (20:38 - 20:41)
irrelevant like somebody's working on (20:40 - 20:43)
that and you can just add it in and it's (20:41 - 20:46)
fine like it is not anything that's (20:43 - 20:48)
gonna break the game which is like we (20:46 - 20:50)
need to fix these things first (20:48 - 20:52)
don't worry about the title screen we (20:50 - 20:54)
can add that the day before (20:52 - 20:55)
i mean (20:54 - 20:57)
final fantasy has been delayed for two (20:55 - 20:59)
weeks (20:57 - 21:04)
for very similar reasons (20:59 - 21:05)
uh (21:04 - 21:08)
at launch a maximum of two players (21:05 - 21:10)
yourself included will be able to battle (21:08 - 21:13)
and trade pokemon in the union room a (21:10 - 21:15)
software update released in the future (21:13 - 21:16)
will allow for more additional players (21:15 - 21:19)
to join please see this page for more (21:16 - 21:20)
details (21:19 - 21:23)
um so i think in (21:20 - 21:25)
in um (21:23 - 21:27)
original diamond and pearl it was four (21:25 - 21:30)
people right 4dss could connect in the (21:27 - 21:32)
union room (21:30 - 21:35)
local or online local or online i don't (21:32 - 21:37)
remember i don't know if online was (21:35 - 21:40)
eight though when i remember (21:37 - 21:42)
i remember looking at screenshots you (21:40 - 21:43)
could see like probably like eight (21:42 - 21:45)
people in our union room yeah (21:43 - 21:48)
it was more (21:45 - 21:48)
i think i think it was four locally (21:49 - 21:52)
because that's all the infrared could (21:50 - 21:53)
handle (21:52 - 21:55)
and i think i do think it was online (21:53 - 21:57)
eight (21:55 - 21:59)
that familiar i don't know it's a long (21:57 - 22:01)
time i can go pull it up i suppose but (21:59 - 22:03)
i'm not going to (22:01 - 22:03)
okay they also say you can befriend (22:07 - 22:12)
mythical pokemon as a perk for linking (22:09 - 22:14)
the pokemon sword pokemon shield pokemon (22:12 - 22:16)
let's go pikachu or pokemon let's go (22:14 - 22:17)
eevee games (22:16 - 22:19)
if players have (22:17 - 22:21)
play records from one of the qualifying (22:19 - 22:22)
games i just read on their nintendo (22:21 - 22:24)
switch when starting their copy of (22:22 - 22:26)
brilliant diamond or shining pearl they (22:24 - 22:26)
will be (22:26 - 22:28)
able to add a mythical pokemon to their (22:26 - 22:31)
team so if you have sword and shield (22:28 - 22:34)
you can speak to the gentleman in the (22:31 - 22:37)
flower field located south west end of (22:34 - 22:41)
flor floremia (22:37 - 22:41)
town to get the mythical pokemon jarachi (22:42 - 22:47)
if you have let's go pikachu let's go (22:45 - 22:48)
eevee you can speak to the (22:47 - 22:50)
madam in this this (22:48 - 22:52)
literally the lady standing next to the (22:50 - 22:53)
dude they're like standing next to each (22:52 - 22:55)
other in this little corner in the map (22:53 - 22:57)
uh in this town and she will give you a (22:55 - 22:58)
mew (22:57 - 23:01)
ooh shiny is it gonna be shiny no this (22:58 - 23:03)
is the most important question (23:01 - 23:05)
i believe these cannot be shiny locked (23:03 - 23:08)
or i believe these are shiny like sorry (23:05 - 23:10)
so jirachi mew (23:08 - 23:13)
um can be (23:10 - 23:16)
added if you own diamond or if you own (23:13 - 23:17)
sword shield or let's go pikachu let's (23:16 - 23:18)
go uv (23:17 - 23:20)
since people were freaking out about not (23:18 - 23:22)
having zapdos i'm going to say those (23:20 - 23:23)
same people probably freaking out that (23:22 - 23:24)
they can't get them you now because they (23:23 - 23:26)
didn't buy let's go feature (23:24 - 23:29)
and the demos don't work the demos don't (23:26 - 23:31)
work the demos don't work just fyi all (23:29 - 23:33)
you do is you find a friend who has the (23:31 - 23:35)
cartridge for the other game put it in (23:33 - 23:37)
your switch start it up (23:35 - 23:39)
and then literally get your pikachu and (23:37 - 23:42)
then save it yeah exactly yeah i am that (23:39 - 23:43)
friend (23:42 - 23:44)
i have it (23:43 - 23:46)
so (23:44 - 23:47)
i (23:46 - 23:48)
we talked about this before talk about (23:47 - 23:51)
it again mythical pokemon is just a (23:48 - 23:54)
mythical is just a it's just a key word (23:51 - 23:57)
for marketing (23:54 - 23:57)
and (23:58 - 24:02)
uh that's that's (24:00 - 24:03)
fine i mean if you're getting both (24:02 - 24:05)
diamond and if you're getting both (24:03 - 24:07)
diamond and pearl and you have one copy (24:05 - 24:10)
of pokemon's shield ideally you will (24:07 - 24:12)
still be able to get a copy uh you will (24:10 - 24:13)
still be able to get jirachi in your (24:12 - 24:15)
copy of diamond and a cot andre in your (24:13 - 24:18)
copy of pearl so the ways to get jirachi (24:15 - 24:21)
um (24:18 - 24:21)
this is cool i i don't know if it (24:22 - 24:28)
convinced like (24:25 - 24:28)
i don't i am sure there are people still (24:29 - 24:34)
on the fence for these games uh and i'm (24:31 - 24:36)
sure them i don't know i don't know if (24:34 - 24:37)
the mythical pokemon are enough to put (24:36 - 24:38)
people over (24:37 - 24:40)
the problem the problem is these games (24:38 - 24:42)
are 60 bucks (24:40 - 24:44)
there have been a lot of ways to get mew (24:42 - 24:47)
in the past uh there's not been a whole (24:44 - 24:49)
lot of ways to get jirachi in the past (24:47 - 24:50)
but jirachi is that weird one where you (24:49 - 24:52)
can like get unlimited jirachi's (24:50 - 24:54)
technically if you had the disc (24:52 - 24:56)
um (24:54 - 24:57)
yeah but then you have to know somebody (24:56 - 25:00)
who had the disc (24:57 - 25:00)
i do think they still sell games right (25:03 - 25:09)
like i do think (25:06 - 25:09)
that people will be like (25:09 - 25:14)
when it's on sale or for christmas or (25:12 - 25:16)
i've got a coupon or i got a gift card i (25:14 - 25:18)
want this i'll pick this up or it's (25:16 - 25:20)
going to encourage them to (25:18 - 25:22)
like the other thing it does is say hey (25:20 - 25:26)
i want to borrow this cartridge from (25:22 - 25:26)
from you to get this and since they do (25:26 - 25:30)
have to play it for a little bit it does (25:28 - 25:32)
sort of maybe encourage them be like oh (25:30 - 25:33)
i played this far it's actually more fun (25:32 - 25:35)
than i thought (25:33 - 25:36)
let me continue with this or i'm going (25:35 - 25:39)
to go buy my own copy like it is a it is (25:36 - 25:42)
an entry point to get people to try (25:39 - 25:44)
these other games (25:42 - 25:46)
to see if maybe they'll buy it right (25:44 - 25:47)
like even if they borrow it they may buy (25:46 - 25:49)
it after playing it for a while so it's (25:47 - 25:51)
kind of like a win-win because it (25:49 - 25:52)
doesn't cost them to give out yet (25:51 - 25:55)
another mew or get it right (25:52 - 25:58)
like i just code (25:55 - 25:58)
um (25:58 - 26:02)
not to switch from diamond pearl but (26:01 - 26:04)
just another pre-order (26:02 - 26:06)
bonus or not pre-order but (26:04 - 26:08)
uh there's a special in-game bonus (26:06 - 26:10)
revealed for legends arceus which is (26:08 - 26:12)
shaymin landform bonus trainers who have (26:10 - 26:13)
played pokemon sword and shield will be (26:12 - 26:16)
able to take on the research quest (26:13 - 26:18)
so they have to at least do something (26:16 - 26:19)
here (26:18 - 26:22)
um in pokemon legends arceus which they (26:19 - 26:23)
will have a chance to add the mythical (26:22 - 26:25)
pokemon shaymin landform to their team (26:23 - 26:27)
they will also be able to claim a shaman (26:25 - 26:30)
kimono set designed after the mythical (26:27 - 26:31)
pokemon (26:30 - 26:33)
the request that allows players to meet (26:31 - 26:35)
shaymin will be available to accept in (26:33 - 26:38)
jubalife village after you view the end (26:35 - 26:41)
game credits players can claim the (26:38 - 26:44)
shaman kimono by speaking to the uh the (26:41 - 26:46)
close person (26:44 - 26:49)
after joining the galaxy expedition team (26:46 - 26:51)
close person (26:49 - 26:53)
i find it interesting that a part the (26:51 - 26:54)
only like the the biggest thing that i (26:53 - 26:56)
find interesting about this announcement (26:54 - 26:57)
is that legends arceus will have some (26:56 - 26:59)
sort of post game (26:57 - 27:02)
because why would you have outfits after (26:59 - 27:03)
the ending credits if there wasn't some (27:02 - 27:06)
post game to enjoy oh i would hope that (27:03 - 27:08)
there was some postgame (27:06 - 27:10)
it's never guaranteed that's true i know (27:08 - 27:12)
nothing about this style of game this (27:10 - 27:14)
could be the only post game though who (27:12 - 27:16)
knows (27:14 - 27:17)
i mean (27:16 - 27:19)
get get the clothing turn the game off (27:17 - 27:21)
never turn it on again okay good how do (27:19 - 27:23)
you get the clothing early you get the (27:21 - 27:24)
clothing earlier (27:23 - 27:27)
i mean sword and shield have sold very (27:24 - 27:30)
well (27:27 - 27:30)
because what are they up to 20 almost 23 (27:31 - 27:36)
million almost 23 million yeah like (27:34 - 27:38)
i think let's go pikachu let's go evie (27:36 - 27:40)
was almost up to 12 million last we (27:38 - 27:41)
checked yeah (27:40 - 27:44)
uh yeah but but (27:41 - 27:46)
holds the king at right yeah 81 million (27:44 - 27:48)
but it is very likely that sword and (27:46 - 27:49)
shield will pass (27:48 - 27:52)
original gold and silver (27:49 - 27:53)
and become the second best-selling (27:52 - 27:55)
pokemon game of all time (27:53 - 27:57)
well according to the statistic gold and (27:55 - 28:00)
silver is at 23.1 and sword and shield (27:57 - 28:03)
is at 22.6 so yeah (28:00 - 28:05)
they don't have far to go no do you have (28:03 - 28:06)
another they have another holiday coming (28:05 - 28:08)
up (28:06 - 28:10)
and there's a bonus (28:08 - 28:12)
to owning those games for these games (28:10 - 28:14)
right like it is (28:12 - 28:18)
a clear marketing push to (28:14 - 28:20)
combine those games or encourage them to (28:18 - 28:21)
buy these games (28:20 - 28:23)
uh you know get diamond and pearl from (28:21 - 28:25)
your mom and dad get sword and shield (28:23 - 28:26)
from your grandpa (28:25 - 28:29)
yeah and they still probably want people (28:26 - 28:31)
to buy sword and shield since uh there's (28:29 - 28:34)
no competitive in diamond and pearl and (28:31 - 28:35)
i you know i wonder if that's like (28:34 - 28:38)
intentional at this point of like i (28:35 - 28:40)
i i think it was intentional also (28:38 - 28:44)
because i think it would be so hard to (28:40 - 28:45)
change out of sword and shield with (28:44 - 28:49)
dynamics already built in and do all the (28:45 - 28:52)
post game work in brilliant diamond (28:49 - 28:55)
like i just feel like they thought (28:52 - 28:58)
this is a very uni like (28:55 - 29:00)
remakes don't sell as well so why would (28:58 - 29:03)
we want to push all competition there (29:00 - 29:04)
when these games are still viable and (29:03 - 29:06)
there's so many people playing these (29:04 - 29:08)
games yeah i i still strongly believe (29:06 - 29:10)
though that since the remakes are made (29:08 - 29:12)
by an external company they are like we (29:10 - 29:14)
are not going to put something as (29:12 - 29:17)
critical as our competitive our yeah (29:14 - 29:19)
yeah which has been so core for so long (29:17 - 29:21)
in somebody else's hands (29:19 - 29:23)
because that that's how cheating happens (29:21 - 29:25)
i don't i don't think intentional is the (29:23 - 29:26)
right word but i think when they were (29:25 - 29:28)
designing sword and shield and they knew (29:26 - 29:30)
that these games were going to follow (29:28 - 29:31)
and they knew that deal it was like (29:30 - 29:34)
sword and shield dlc these games arceus (29:31 - 29:37)
then whatever we have afterwards (29:34 - 29:39)
i think it was like we know that this (29:37 - 29:40)
competitive scene is going to be three (29:39 - 29:43)
years in this specific game yeah (29:40 - 29:44)
and (29:43 - 29:46)
um (29:44 - 29:48)
and that it wasn't like oh (29:46 - 29:51)
like i just don't think (29:48 - 29:52)
that (29:51 - 29:54)
how they make games and how they plan (29:52 - 29:56)
out their structure i don't think that (29:54 - 29:58)
the release schedule of this game and (29:56 - 30:00)
the release schedule of arceus i don't (29:58 - 30:01)
think those were just like randomly (30:00 - 30:03)
picked i think they they have a they (30:01 - 30:05)
obviously cove had probably messed some (30:03 - 30:06)
of that stuff up but (30:05 - 30:08)
um (30:06 - 30:09)
i'm going to (30:08 - 30:11)
safely assume once diamond pro comes out (30:09 - 30:13)
there will still be those raid weekends (30:11 - 30:15)
and sword and shield there will still be (30:13 - 30:17)
season changes there will probably still (30:15 - 30:20)
be a new format that we haven't seen (30:17 - 30:23)
before in sword and shield um to keep (30:20 - 30:25)
that competitive stuff alive (30:23 - 30:27)
uh and i hope that there is at least (30:25 - 30:29)
some sort of compatibility before (30:27 - 30:31)
between diamond and pearl yeah with (30:29 - 30:32)
sword and shield so you can be like well (30:31 - 30:34)
i caught a (30:32 - 30:36)
i caught a snover here i can still move (30:34 - 30:37)
it over (30:36 - 30:39)
sword and shield will have an update to (30:37 - 30:41)
at least accept that new symbol (30:39 - 30:43)
because we know that we're not getting (30:41 - 30:46)
that update until early 2022 yep but i (30:43 - 30:47)
don't see why sword and shield would be (30:46 - 30:49)
like nope can't take any snovers from (30:47 - 30:52)
diamond and pearl that's too complicated (30:49 - 30:53)
that's probably (30:52 - 30:55)
i think that's probably a pretty (30:53 - 30:57)
yeah i mean all diamond and pearl and (30:55 - 30:59)
legends of arches do is they add yet (30:57 - 31:02)
another game to the calendar weekend (30:59 - 31:03)
where everything else happens everything (31:02 - 31:04)
is going to happen (31:03 - 31:06)
is like great i'm just going to pencil (31:04 - 31:08)
them in on those exact same days we're (31:06 - 31:10)
going to have legendary cartridge day in (31:08 - 31:12)
diamond and pearl we're going to have (31:10 - 31:13)
legendary raid weekends and sword and (31:12 - 31:16)
shield we're going to have cartridge (31:13 - 31:18)
raid somehow in pokemon go it's all (31:16 - 31:21)
going to happen on january 14th (31:18 - 31:23)
so we got we got one day to get it done (31:21 - 31:25)
it's gonna happen the same weekend (31:23 - 31:26)
legends come out good luck have fun (31:25 - 31:29)
here's a community (31:26 - 31:29)
although i do when i think about it (31:29 - 31:33)
though (31:31 - 31:35)
if you have people that only play one (31:33 - 31:36)
thing (31:35 - 31:39)
to have everybody excited about pokemon (31:36 - 31:41)
different aspects to be able to talk to (31:39 - 31:43)
each other like i'm doing something fun (31:41 - 31:45)
on this day (31:43 - 31:47)
is kind of clever (31:45 - 31:49)
it is because it it has that sort of (31:47 - 31:51)
community feel even though people might (31:49 - 31:53)
be doing different things i mean in an (31:51 - 31:56)
ideal world yes (31:53 - 31:57)
but we all know (31:56 - 32:00)
of the huge walls that each of the (31:57 - 32:03)
pokemon community builds uh i i i will (32:00 - 32:06)
not speak with a pokemon go player oh no (32:03 - 32:08)
oh no no no especially shield players (32:06 - 32:11)
especially if they would safari (32:08 - 32:13)
pure pokemon i don't play (32:11 - 32:15)
go (32:13 - 32:16)
[Music] (32:15 - 32:19)
yeah i mean like even though i uh we've (32:16 - 32:21)
complained and and like the our folks in (32:19 - 32:23)
slack they're like ah there's so much (32:21 - 32:25)
happening this weekend like we are such (32:23 - 32:28)
the exception to that like not every (32:25 - 32:30)
pokemon player is doing go sword and (32:28 - 32:32)
shield tcg (32:30 - 32:33)
whatever (32:32 - 32:35)
masters (32:33 - 32:38)
masters never has a special weekend (32:35 - 32:40)
the math is just like here's more people (32:38 - 32:42)
go gotta fit in that pikmin you know i (32:40 - 32:44)
saw an interesting conversation uh also (32:42 - 32:46)
happened this week where uh so we talked (32:44 - 32:49)
about how you can get mew and jirachi (32:46 - 32:51)
pretty early literally before the second (32:49 - 32:53)
gym because the second gym is gardenia (32:51 - 32:55)
and so you can get a mew (32:53 - 32:57)
and a jirachi (32:55 - 32:58)
before the second gym (32:57 - 33:02)
very possible um (32:58 - 33:05)
easy mode this this is not new to any (33:02 - 33:08)
pokemon game you can technically trade (33:05 - 33:10)
yourself a guard chomp if you wanted to (33:08 - 33:12)
to start your journey you can choose to (33:10 - 33:14)
go through the entire game with the (33:12 - 33:16)
weedle if you never want to evolve it (33:14 - 33:19)
you can choose to use eternitis against (33:16 - 33:21)
the leon battle or not use the eternitis (33:19 - 33:23)
by the way if you do use eternitis you (33:21 - 33:25)
will get special voice dialogue from (33:23 - 33:28)
leon being like you're you're a cheater (33:25 - 33:29)
please delete your copy that's what he (33:28 - 33:30)
says (33:29 - 33:32)
how dare you (33:30 - 33:34)
how dare you use this against me but (33:32 - 33:36)
uh (33:34 - 33:37)
the conversation just seemed very (33:36 - 33:39)
negative it was like oh kids are going (33:37 - 33:41)
to be like pokemon games are too easy (33:39 - 33:42)
because they're getting them you are (33:41 - 33:44)
jirachi and like i roll my eyes because (33:42 - 33:47)
like who cares if it's easy not even (33:44 - 33:49)
that in in (33:47 - 33:50)
black and white (33:49 - 33:52)
you could get victini i think right (33:50 - 33:55)
before the third gym yes i think you (33:52 - 33:58)
need two gyms for victimi yeah and like (33:55 - 33:59)
okay where's the difference here kids (33:58 - 34:01)
and so there's there's no difference but (33:59 - 34:02)
ten years later (34:01 - 34:04)
they're doing the same thing but it's (34:02 - 34:06)
it's the same conversation every single (34:04 - 34:08)
year when these mythicals come out but (34:06 - 34:09)
and at the end of the day i just think (34:08 - 34:11)
to myself like hey if that kid wants to (34:09 - 34:13)
use jirachi and he's having a great time (34:11 - 34:15)
and he makes it to the end of game the (34:13 - 34:18)
game because he had a jirachi (34:15 - 34:21)
how is that an l kids these days have it (34:18 - 34:23)
too easy (34:21 - 34:25)
they get these super powerful pokemon (34:23 - 34:26)
right off the bat (34:25 - 34:28)
they don't have to go up against brock (34:26 - 34:30)
with a caterpie (34:28 - 34:34)
i had to play the real pokemon (34:30 - 34:34)
it is just (34:39 - 34:41)
it is adult (34:43 - 34:50)
nostalgia glasses 100 where you believed (34:46 - 34:52)
you had to work look your parents had to (34:50 - 34:54)
work hard to get that for you (34:52 - 34:56)
that you you are now the parent now you (34:54 - 34:58)
have to do the hard work quote unquote (34:56 - 35:01)
to do that 100 like when i was your age (34:58 - 35:03)
i had to walk up hill to school and (35:01 - 35:08)
uphill back from school like what (35:03 - 35:09)
yeah it just like reminds me of like the (35:08 - 35:11)
player that's like (35:09 - 35:13)
pokemon games are too easy but literally (35:11 - 35:15)
after every single battle in a gym they (35:13 - 35:17)
walk out and walk to the pokemon center (35:15 - 35:18)
and then walk back in the gym and then (35:17 - 35:20)
do the next battle and then walk out and (35:18 - 35:21)
then go to the pokemon center and it's (35:20 - 35:22)
like (35:21 - 35:25)
you just said it was (35:22 - 35:26)
i mean like play the game how you want (35:25 - 35:28)
to play it like yeah but then they got (35:26 - 35:31)
mad we got locked into trials (35:28 - 35:34)
yeah they did like (35:31 - 35:36)
pick your poison (35:34 - 35:37)
and they're not all the same people (35:36 - 35:39)
right like it is just it is that sort of (35:37 - 35:42)
thing where like (35:39 - 35:44)
negativity gets views (35:42 - 35:45)
and honestly if you push them against it (35:44 - 35:48)
they back down real quick uh as long as (35:45 - 35:49)
they're in person and not online because (35:48 - 35:51)
online they're just gonna dig in (35:49 - 35:53)
hardcore and never move (35:51 - 35:56)
uh because that's what online do (35:53 - 35:58)
but i think it's just one of the things (35:56 - 36:00)
where (35:58 - 36:01)
it's like the question we had what made (36:00 - 36:05)
mythicals less special you grew up (36:01 - 36:06)
right like that kid is still gonna be (36:05 - 36:08)
like there's this person who gave me (36:06 - 36:10)
this super cool (36:08 - 36:12)
pokemon that i've never seen before it (36:10 - 36:14)
was super strong and i'm very excited (36:12 - 36:15)
about it and like that (36:14 - 36:18)
connects them very strongly to this game (36:15 - 36:21)
and it is a tie to the other games they (36:18 - 36:23)
have played like that connection (36:21 - 36:25)
builds memories when you're in an (36:23 - 36:27)
impressionable youth (36:25 - 36:29)
like steve will never forget that super (36:27 - 36:32)
rare gold duck he got that nobody else (36:29 - 36:33)
had that's true (36:32 - 36:35)
and like those are huge connections and (36:33 - 36:37)
so (36:35 - 36:40)
your desire to be a child again is (36:37 - 36:42)
blurring (36:40 - 36:45)
your idea of what hard is (36:42 - 36:47)
it was hard because you were young and (36:45 - 36:51)
you'd never played the games before (36:47 - 36:53)
that's it it's never going to be hard (36:51 - 36:56)
again because you've played the games (36:53 - 36:58)
there's no amount of (36:56 - 37:00)
cranking up the difficulty (36:58 - 37:02)
that's not going to make you forget the (37:00 - 37:04)
the super effective charts or over (37:02 - 37:06)
leveling all those world of warcraft (37:04 - 37:08)
people they wanted that original (37:06 - 37:09)
experience back and then they got it (37:08 - 37:12)
they got it really like this awful (37:09 - 37:14)
we kept submitting bugs and how the game (37:12 - 37:17)
worked back then (37:14 - 37:17)
okay we still have some more diamond (37:17 - 37:20)
pearl news but they're related to go (37:18 - 37:22)
since go is going to do an event but (37:20 - 37:24)
before we do that we're going to take a (37:22 - 37:26)
quick break and then when we come back (37:24 - 37:27)
we're going to talk about the diamond (37:26 - 37:30)
pearl event and go and then the safari (37:27 - 37:34)

kind of cool i guess (43:26 - 43:31)
granted you have enough time (43:28 - 43:31)
all right uh well let's (43:36 - 43:42)
dive into the safari zone that was a (43:39 - 43:42)
thing (43:42 - 43:45)
we went to a safari zone there were wild (43:42 - 43:48)
pokemon everywhere it was quite the (43:45 - 43:53)
safari if safaris happened in (43:48 - 43:55)
antarctica they could (43:53 - 43:57)
think it happened in antarctica look it (43:55 - 44:00)
was a little cold (43:57 - 44:00)
much of the after like the morning was (44:02 - 44:05)
fine as long as we were in the sun and (44:03 - 44:07)
out of the wind (44:05 - 44:09)
which is very hard to do but also my (44:07 - 44:12)
commentary on this uh diamond and pearl (44:09 - 44:13)
release several celebration is i don't (44:12 - 44:15)
need any more burmese (44:13 - 44:18)
lee no more burmese thank you done no (44:15 - 44:21)
burmese we had a lot of safari burmese (44:18 - 44:24)
we had a lot of safari (44:21 - 44:29)
chat uh i found the elusive unknown s (44:24 - 44:32)
i i was all over that park i was (44:29 - 44:34)
catching balls i was finding the guy's (44:32 - 44:37)
teeth i was doing all the things (44:34 - 44:38)
okay maybe maybe let's explain what (44:37 - 44:41)
safari zone is real quick so uh we (44:38 - 44:44)
planned this event two years ago yeah so (44:41 - 44:46)
we made a decision two years ago and it (44:44 - 44:48)
finally came true this year i would (44:46 - 44:49)
actually describe it as this is the (44:48 - 44:51)
first and last event that steve will and (44:49 - 44:54)
greg will ever do together (44:51 - 44:54)
the fact that we're all here today (44:56 - 45:01)
recording this is actually the miracle (44:58 - 45:04)
look i got the safari zone shirt on like (45:01 - 45:06)
i prepared oh true (45:04 - 45:07)
if you're watching the youtube version (45:06 - 45:08)
you can see the shirt (45:07 - 45:11)
so great shirt by the way (45:08 - 45:13)
a safari zone (45:11 - 45:15)
is (45:13 - 45:19)
not a community day but not a go fest (45:15 - 45:20)
and (45:19 - 45:21)
i (45:20 - 45:23)
i had a lot of people like you know ask (45:21 - 45:25)
and that's a very common question the (45:23 - 45:27)
pokemon go community is like how are the (45:25 - 45:29)
shinies what's happening (45:27 - 45:31)
um (45:29 - 45:33)
it's it's a little bit in between so if (45:31 - 45:35)
you've never been to a safari zone (45:33 - 45:36)
and maybe a lot of people haven't (45:35 - 45:39)
because of uh you know the past (45:36 - 45:40)
two years (45:39 - 45:43)
it is usually at a park (45:40 - 45:46)
like a go fest has been in chicago's (45:43 - 45:48)
parks and their niantic will set up um (45:46 - 45:50)
like tents (45:48 - 45:52)
and they will have little competitions (45:50 - 45:53)
normally they usually have a store for (45:52 - 45:55)
both like a niantic store and a pokemon (45:53 - 45:58)
center store they usually have um the (45:55 - 46:02)
very repetitive pokemon go music playing (45:58 - 46:04)
at some of these stations (46:02 - 46:05)
they usually have like photo (46:04 - 46:07)
opportunities there are signs everywhere (46:05 - 46:09)
being like hey if you're walking through (46:07 - 46:10)
this you're giving us permission to take (46:09 - 46:12)
photos (46:10 - 46:14)
the spawns are incredibly good (46:12 - 46:16)
everything is lured up your incense is (46:14 - 46:19)
great there's uh but but when it comes (46:16 - 46:21)
down to like (46:19 - 46:22)
shiny stuff (46:21 - 46:24)
i can't remember what the safari zone (46:22 - 46:26)
odds are but community is like one in 25 (46:24 - 46:29)
yeah normal odds are like one in 500 (46:26 - 46:32)
uh and then you're you're like go fest (46:29 - 46:34)
is like closer to like one in a hundred (46:32 - 46:36)
and i want to say last time i checked (46:34 - 46:37)
safari zone was like closer to like one (46:36 - 46:40)
in 200 ish (46:37 - 46:44)
sounds about right um (46:40 - 46:46)
but (46:44 - 46:48)
like everything go related you're going (46:46 - 46:50)
for the experience i mean like it is (46:48 - 46:52)
cool if you know if you know you're (46:50 - 46:53)
never going to make it to australia new (46:52 - 46:55)
zealand to get like a chat you get chats (46:53 - 46:57)
for your friends (46:55 - 46:59)
it's cool to collect letters of unknown (46:57 - 47:01)
the unknown this time spelled st louis (46:59 - 47:03)
so that's a handful of letters that you (47:01 - 47:05)
can complete yeah i only got the first s (47:03 - 47:07)
from the saint i could not get the s for (47:05 - 47:10)
lewis though (47:07 - 47:12)
i looked i looked and i looked and i (47:10 - 47:14)
could not find the last ass (47:12 - 47:16)
uh throw is technically a regional right (47:14 - 47:18)
now um (47:16 - 47:20)
i think throw and sock rotated i haven't (47:18 - 47:23)
seen stock in a long time uh but anyways (47:20 - 47:25)
there was throw there although i don't (47:23 - 47:26)
remember if he's regional or not the (47:25 - 47:28)
featured pokemon i suppose one of the (47:26 - 47:30)
featured pokemon was teddy ursa (47:28 - 47:32)
so when you finish your research you did (47:30 - 47:35)
get a shiny teddy ursa guaranteed which (47:32 - 47:37)
was kind of nice (47:35 - 47:38)
but yeah and and (47:37 - 47:41)
unlike (47:38 - 47:43)
the couple (47:41 - 47:45)
go fest we went to (47:43 - 47:47)
uh there were raids here (47:45 - 47:48)
the first couple gofest didn't really (47:47 - 47:50)
have any raids because we learned from (47:48 - 47:51)
year one that that was a complete (47:50 - 47:53)
disaster and then the second year they (47:51 - 47:55)
were like no raids allowed and (47:53 - 47:57)
that's fine (47:55 - 47:59)
um (47:57 - 48:01)
and so to lay out that whole experience (47:59 - 48:03)
the the place that we want was called (48:01 - 48:06)
tower grove park which is an incredible (48:03 - 48:06)
park (48:06 - 48:09)
that place is so cool (48:06 - 48:13)
and they they sold tickets to this event (48:09 - 48:18)
two years ago in 2019. it sold out (48:13 - 48:21)
and they had a makeup day for those (48:18 - 48:23)
people i i did that on twitch i sat (48:21 - 48:24)
there in my office chair and did the (48:23 - 48:26)
makeup day and played it (48:24 - 48:28)
you could (48:26 - 48:30)
have opted for a refund (48:28 - 48:32)
but you would have not been able to do (48:30 - 48:34)
the community or with a makeup day but (48:32 - 48:35)
they did say when the makeup day was (48:34 - 48:37)
happening that there would still be an (48:35 - 48:40)
irl event (48:37 - 48:41)
so (48:40 - 48:43)
this was the irl event (48:41 - 48:44)
it was (48:43 - 48:47)
very cold (48:44 - 48:48)
unfortunately (48:47 - 48:50)
and (48:48 - 48:52)
it was very (48:50 - 48:53)
empty (48:52 - 48:55)
yeah well for us because we're on the (48:53 - 48:57)
friday right yeah i had a low (48:55 - 48:59)
expectation that people were going to (48:57 - 49:00)
take off work for (48:59 - 49:04)
the two-year-old makeup (49:00 - 49:06)
in the middle only happened winter (49:04 - 49:09)
season (49:06 - 49:09)
i would say oh boy (49:10 - 49:15)
okay i do want to say niantic did offer (49:13 - 49:16)
me free tickets to this event but (49:15 - 49:18)
because i bought the tickets two years (49:16 - 49:20)
ago i didn't need them i actually gave (49:18 - 49:22)
the tickets away so to those two people (49:20 - 49:24)
who received my free tickets i hope you (49:22 - 49:27)
enjoyed them you know who you are (49:24 - 49:27)
wasn't me i got it (49:28 - 49:34)
i have been to (49:32 - 49:36)
worlds i've been to nationals i've been (49:34 - 49:39)
to regionals i've been to pokemon fan (49:36 - 49:42)
conventions i've been to (49:39 - 49:45)
go fest i've been to a lot of different (49:42 - 49:46)
pokemon events (49:45 - 49:50)
symphonic evolutions mall tours you name (49:46 - 49:52)
it i've done it (49:50 - 49:55)
this has this event was the (49:52 - 49:57)
smallest (49:55 - 50:00)
gathering of pokemon players i have ever (49:57 - 50:01)
gone to (50:00 - 50:04)
for for the in crazy (50:01 - 50:06)
the insane amount of work knights have (50:04 - 50:08)
put in i i i will say yes i agree the (50:06 - 50:11)
amount of work that niantic yeah (50:08 - 50:12)
compared to the number of people that (50:11 - 50:14)
showed up yeah your proportion is (50:12 - 50:15)
correct (50:14 - 50:16)
also (50:15 - 50:18)
shout out to the staff that work that (50:16 - 50:19)
event (50:18 - 50:21)
they were the friendliest (50:19 - 50:24)
nicest absolutely most awesome people (50:21 - 50:25)
like they were willing to talk to you (50:24 - 50:27)
and help you and like oh do you want us (50:25 - 50:29)
to take your picture and have you seen (50:27 - 50:30)
this and you go over here and do this (50:29 - 50:32)
and we'll put a weird frog stamp on your (50:30 - 50:33)
hand like (50:32 - 50:37)
they were super frog stamps (50:33 - 50:37)
uh they were super super friendly super (50:38 - 50:42)
helpful (50:40 - 50:43)
i felt (50:42 - 50:46)
kind of bad for them because there were (50:43 - 50:47)
so few people like you could see that (50:46 - 50:50)
they were just like standing around but (50:47 - 50:52)
also the park was huge (50:50 - 50:55)
so the massive the stands are so far (50:52 - 50:57)
away from each other (50:55 - 50:58)
and i was like they can't even go talk (50:57 - 51:00)
to each other because they don't know if (50:58 - 51:02)
they're going to be busy or not (51:00 - 51:04)
but (51:02 - 51:06)
i mean there was i i don't want to sell (51:04 - 51:09)
like there was nobody there there were (51:06 - 51:13)
people there it's just not (51:09 - 51:14)
the (51:13 - 51:15)
i think we were all (51:14 - 51:18)
[Music] (51:15 - 51:20)
maybe surprised at how few there were (51:18 - 51:22)
there because they definitely gonna fit (51:20 - 51:25)
fit in more and there's nothing though (51:22 - 51:28)
we got there early yeah and so it was (51:25 - 51:31)
cold yeah cause it started at nine (51:28 - 51:33)
so like the day didn't really heat up (51:31 - 51:35)
our high for that day was supposed to be (51:33 - 51:38)
47 degrees fahrenheit for (51:35 - 51:39)
our canadian listeners (51:38 - 51:41)
um (51:39 - 51:42)
and (51:41 - 51:44)
so we're like okay we're early access (51:42 - 51:46)
not everyone was early access so it was (51:44 - 51:48)
like really dead like honestly we (51:46 - 51:51)
probably saw maybe like upwards of 20 (51:48 - 51:53)
other people playing (51:51 - 51:54)
around us (51:53 - 51:55)
right (51:54 - 51:57)
this park is huge (51:55 - 51:58)
and (51:57 - 52:00)
when it got into the afternoon so there (51:58 - 52:01)
was a there they what the cool thing (52:00 - 52:04)
they did is the the the (52:01 - 52:06)
niantic people or helpers or staff (52:04 - 52:09)
they're like hey just a heads up there's (52:06 - 52:11)
a raid event at 1 30. and every time we (52:09 - 52:12)
like walked past somebody they were like (52:11 - 52:14)
how are you do you need any help yeah (52:12 - 52:17)
also there's a write event at 1 30. (52:14 - 52:19)
uh (52:17 - 52:21)
so 130 being the right event and having (52:19 - 52:24)
the most people (52:21 - 52:27)
it it like it wasn't that busy (52:24 - 52:29)
unfortunately i mean but also i don't (52:27 - 52:32)
because they (52:29 - 52:34)
they were only selling (52:32 - 52:35)
so many (52:34 - 52:38)
physical in-person tickets right they (52:35 - 52:40)
sold no more tickets since 2019. yeah (52:38 - 52:42)
but you but there's only like a certain (52:40 - 52:44)
amount that could there was like rsvp (52:42 - 52:46)
for coming in person (52:44 - 52:48)
and i don't know if those are limited (52:46 - 52:50)
like i don't know if there were (52:48 - 52:52)
that they really decided to keep social (52:50 - 52:55)
distancing and say you have to rsvp and (52:52 - 52:56)
we're (52:55 - 52:57)
if you come in too late you're not going (52:56 - 52:59)
to get any of these (52:57 - 53:00)
um (52:59 - 53:04)
and it didn't speak to me so much of uh (53:00 - 53:06)
like oh people didn't want to come here (53:04 - 53:08)
it was much more like they people are (53:06 - 53:11)
overly cautious niantic was overly (53:08 - 53:14)
cautious this park is huge and they just (53:11 - 53:16)
wanted to make sure that you didn't have (53:14 - 53:19)
to clump with anybody if you didn't want (53:16 - 53:22)
to yeah but i i honestly think that (53:19 - 53:24)
from from my perspective the major (53:22 - 53:27)
contributing factor was that we went on (53:24 - 53:28)
a friday (53:27 - 53:31)
which is a work day yeah people are (53:28 - 53:34)
actually back to work again (53:31 - 53:35)
and (53:34 - 53:37)
this was two years ago you could have (53:35 - 53:38)
people who were (53:37 - 53:41)
super active go players two years ago (53:38 - 53:43)
who have dropped off and they're like (53:41 - 53:45)
i'm not going to take time off of work (53:43 - 53:47)
i'm not going to travel to st louis (53:45 - 53:48)
where two years ago they would have been (53:47 - 53:50)
like oh yeah we're getting 10 people in (53:48 - 53:51)
a hotel room and we're all going to (53:50 - 53:54)
crash and do safari zone and have a wild (53:51 - 53:55)
time (53:54 - 53:57)
i i i doubt (53:55 - 53:59)
that it was even 10 of the people who (53:57 - 54:01)
bought tickets showed up because why (53:59 - 54:03)
would you agree yeah yeah (54:01 - 54:05)
like niantic did the right thing and (54:03 - 54:08)
said hey we're actually doing this event (54:05 - 54:09)
you're more than welcome to come because (54:08 - 54:11)
you bought a ticket but also if you (54:09 - 54:14)
can't we understand play it at home yeah (54:11 - 54:16)
yeah and if you remember with this one (54:14 - 54:17)
it was i don't remember exactly what it (54:16 - 54:19)
was but it was like if you had a ticket (54:17 - 54:22)
you could sponsor like two other people (54:19 - 54:24)
to get tickets or something weird like (54:22 - 54:26)
that and i did that and my two other (54:24 - 54:28)
people didn't come (54:26 - 54:29)
they played from home but they they (54:28 - 54:31)
stayed home (54:29 - 54:33)
when originally they had intended to (54:31 - 54:35)
come down and play with us (54:33 - 54:37)
the thing the thing i want to say though (54:35 - 54:39)
is (54:37 - 54:41)
it was it was like whether the weather (54:39 - 54:44)
was miserable it was awful i had i had (54:41 - 54:46)
hand warmers i had tow warmers i had (54:44 - 54:48)
long underwear i had a scarf i had my (54:46 - 54:52)
hood on i had a jacket on i (54:48 - 54:53)
thought i was prepared i am from (54:52 - 54:56)
wisconsin i am very used to like the (54:53 - 54:57)
cold (54:56 - 54:59)
you know i i have (54:57 - 55:01)
you know friends in (54:59 - 55:03)
texas that are like oh boy it's it's 68 (55:01 - 55:05)
degrees today out it's really chilly and (55:03 - 55:07)
i'm like you're you're out of your mind (55:05 - 55:10)
if you think 68 degrees is chilly (55:07 - 55:12)
like i i have a pretty high tolerance i (55:10 - 55:14)
think for the cold (55:12 - 55:15)
compared to (55:14 - 55:19)
anyone south of maybe missouri i will (55:15 - 55:21)
give you that compared to people in the (55:19 - 55:22)
south you have a higher tolerance from (55:21 - 55:23)
gold (55:22 - 55:26)
but it was it was at a certain point i (55:23 - 55:28)
was just like it it's not it the the (55:26 - 55:32)
event itself is great but it's like my (55:28 - 55:33)
hands hurt (55:32 - 55:36)
like my body hurts it's just so cold (55:33 - 55:39)
that it it's not fun to like catch (55:36 - 55:41)
pokemon or to even walk anymore yeah (55:39 - 55:43)
when you get that full body shiver right (55:41 - 55:45)
it's like your entire body is just like (55:43 - 55:46)
oh (55:45 - 55:48)
well it was like in the morning we could (55:46 - 55:50)
find places to be in the sun and you (55:48 - 55:52)
could warm up and you felt like okay (55:50 - 55:54)
well as long as the sun holds out and i (55:52 - 55:57)
can't find these places i get a break (55:54 - 55:58)
from (55:57 - 56:01)
the cold we went to lunch the clouds (55:58 - 56:04)
moved in it started to snow and there (56:01 - 56:05)
was no (56:04 - 56:08)
there was no coming back it was just (56:05 - 56:12)
solid cold from that time on and (56:08 - 56:13)
having to pull your hand like hand (56:12 - 56:15)
warmers only do so much if you keep you (56:13 - 56:17)
in your pockets we have to pull it out (56:15 - 56:18)
to play the game (56:17 - 56:20)
so it was like you were always exposing (56:18 - 56:22)
parts of like and my hands are out not (56:20 - 56:25)
the cold because i had two hand warmers (56:22 - 56:26)
uh electric ones and i would be like (56:25 - 56:28)
it's great when i'm holding close my (56:26 - 56:30)
body but when i have to play the game i (56:28 - 56:32)
pull them out into this freezing cold (56:30 - 56:34)
and i'm miserable again but there's like (56:32 - 56:36)
a certain point (56:34 - 56:38)
and maybe people in the the south don't (56:36 - 56:39)
get this (56:38 - 56:41)
like (56:39 - 56:42)
there's a certain point where the cold (56:41 - 56:44)
just gets through to you and no matter (56:42 - 56:47)
what you're like like when we got back (56:44 - 56:49)
to the hotel and i was sitting down i (56:47 - 56:51)
was still (56:49 - 56:53)
i still felt as cold as i did (56:51 - 56:55)
even though the only thing that will (56:53 - 56:58)
warm you up is getting a bath bomb and (56:55 - 57:00)
sitting in a massive spot yeah and going (56:58 - 57:03)
our bath and body works and spending (57:00 - 57:05)
eighteen dollars on bath salt which is (57:03 - 57:06)
incredible (57:05 - 57:08)
chai latte which is my preferred way of (57:06 - 57:11)
warming up (57:08 - 57:12)
if the weather (57:11 - 57:14)
was (57:12 - 57:16)
like 10 degrees warmer if it didn't (57:14 - 57:19)
start snowing if the sun was actually (57:16 - 57:20)
out (57:19 - 57:22)
if it wasn't so windy i think the cold (57:20 - 57:23)
would have been (57:22 - 57:27)
tolerable if it wasn't so windy because (57:23 - 57:29)
like when it was no wind and kind of (57:27 - 57:31)
work i was like okay it's cold but the (57:29 - 57:33)
wind picked up and you're like nah this (57:31 - 57:34)
is (57:33 - 57:38)
this is bad it is so cold (57:34 - 57:38)
but (57:38 - 57:41)
if the weather wasn't awful (57:38 - 57:42)
it would have been an incredible (57:41 - 57:44)
experience yeah (57:42 - 57:46)
i mean i will say i still had an (57:44 - 57:47)
incredibly fun time (57:46 - 57:49)
right like we got to meet a lot of super (57:47 - 57:52)
great people we had a lot of fun (57:49 - 57:54)
we got to (57:52 - 57:56)
the spawns weren't (57:54 - 57:58)
anything particularly great but (57:56 - 58:02)
we had to tour a very cool park we got (57:58 - 58:03)
to see parts of a city that i'd never (58:02 - 58:05)
seen i got to meet a bunch of people we (58:03 - 58:08)
got to hang out i mean like (58:05 - 58:09)
all of the (58:08 - 58:11)
if my only complaint was that i'm cold (58:09 - 58:14)
that's still a very good yeah event to (58:11 - 58:16)
me we had a lot of fun (58:14 - 58:19)
even though we had to like go inside (58:16 - 58:20)
every time and be like i just need a (58:19 - 58:22)
break and to also if you only went to (58:20 - 58:25)
play for like a couple of hours the cold (58:22 - 58:27)
was tolerable we were out there for (58:25 - 58:30)
eight hours like we were not really (58:27 - 58:32)
giving ourselves great breaks (58:30 - 58:34)
to go in and warm up like we were just (58:32 - 58:36)
the people were like we're gonna be this (58:34 - 58:38)
here all the time and it wasn't cold (58:36 - 58:40)
there was a part of me that was like we (58:38 - 58:42)
did this on saturday where like hey i (58:40 - 58:44)
want to walk 10 000 steps for pikmin but (58:42 - 58:45)
i don't want to walk outside because (58:44 - 58:47)
it's so cold and let's go to a mall and (58:45 - 58:50)
do it so that that (58:47 - 58:51)
missouri you have the worst malls you (58:50 - 58:53)
have bad malls oh one hundred percent (58:51 - 58:55)
agree we have bad balls your malls are (58:53 - 58:57)
like hallways (58:55 - 58:58)
and (58:57 - 59:00)
they they're awful joyless hallways yeah (58:58 - 59:01)
joyless (59:00 - 59:04)
so we went to the first the first mall (59:01 - 59:06)
we went to it was that west county mall (59:04 - 59:08)
yeah i think it was i was like name them (59:06 - 59:13)
by name named criminals by name yeah so (59:08 - 59:14)
i was like in that mom like well this is (59:13 - 59:16)
kind of a sad mall (59:14 - 59:19)
isn't that great and everything oh well (59:16 - 59:21)
the gallery is the fancy when you walk (59:19 - 59:24)
through west county you're like hmm (59:21 - 59:25)
surprise this is still in business but (59:24 - 59:27)
yeah this is a sad mall (59:25 - 59:29)
they're like i don't know gallery is the (59:27 - 59:30)
good one gallery is the fastest we went (59:29 - 59:34)
to that that is also a sad sad mall oh (59:30 - 59:36)
people like i knew about the galleria (59:34 - 59:38)
when i worked (59:36 - 59:39)
at apple (59:38 - 59:41)
because we would have so the thing about (59:39 - 59:43)
st louis i don't know what that well but (59:41 - 59:45)
st louis has like one tech or missouri (59:43 - 59:47)
or maybe maybe it's missouri but they (59:45 - 59:49)
have like a tax-free day (59:47 - 59:52)
so when i worked at apple people would (59:49 - 59:53)
drive (59:52 - 59:55)
to st louis to the galleria because (59:53 - 59:57)
that's where an apple store is (59:55 - 60:00)
and they would buy a computer because it (59:57 - 60:02)
was tax free day but then they would use (60:00 - 60:05)
their employee discount so they would (60:02 - 60:06)
double dip (60:05 - 60:09)
and i think that was once a year so for (60:06 - 60:11)
years i've heard that oh my gosh the (60:09 - 60:14)
galleria this is the mall and they got (60:11 - 60:17)
the apple store and the tax-free and the (60:14 - 60:19)
discount and so i was like i've i've (60:17 - 60:21)
never seen the galleria let's go to the (60:19 - 60:23)
galleria when we were with people greg (60:21 - 60:25)
they were saying like you gotta go to (60:23 - 60:26)
the galleria you gotta go to the (60:25 - 60:27)
galleria (60:26 - 60:30)
that's the fancy mall it is awful it is (60:27 - 60:33)
a bad ball it's a glorified three-tier (60:30 - 60:35)
hallway (60:33 - 60:38)
i was like (60:35 - 60:38)
i was expecting when they're like this (60:39 - 60:44)
is a good mall i was expecting our (60:41 - 60:46)
galleria level fancy (60:44 - 60:50)
yeah the galleria in edina is (60:46 - 60:52)
it's an experience it's super fancy yes (60:50 - 60:55)
so i was expecting that when i walked in (60:52 - 60:56)
there i'm like (60:55 - 60:58)
they've literally not updated this since (60:56 - 61:01)
the 80s this is an 80s mall (60:58 - 61:03)
very much and (61:01 - 61:05)
and and right for for for the listeners (61:03 - 61:08)
keep in mind greg and i are the original (61:05 - 61:11)
mall rats we grew up in a time where the (61:08 - 61:13)
only thing teenagers had to do on the (61:11 - 61:15)
weekend was to go to the mall yeah and (61:13 - 61:17)
walk around for four hours yes we know (61:15 - 61:19)
our malls we know our malls my i have (61:17 - 61:22)
lived the mall life (61:19 - 61:23)
i i thought oh we're gonna walk they're (61:22 - 61:26)
gonna have really good stores and the (61:23 - 61:28)
display is gonna be fancy and i don't (61:26 - 61:29)
know (61:28 - 61:32)
i i can i can say i can give a lot of (61:29 - 61:34)
credit based on kovid (61:32 - 61:36)
but not enough scrubbing how bad that (61:34 - 61:39)
mall was that's a bad mall it wasn't it (61:36 - 61:40)
just (61:39 - 61:42)
like look i know people have complaints (61:40 - 61:45)
about mall of america very overpriced (61:42 - 61:47)
parking's a nightmare (61:45 - 61:50)
but mall of america is like clean it's (61:47 - 61:54)
wide there's restaurants on every floor (61:50 - 61:57)
there's bathrooms everywhere it's bright (61:54 - 61:59)
you don't feel like your soul is getting (61:57 - 62:01)
crushed the main bad thing about mall (61:59 - 62:02)
america is just everything in there is (62:01 - 62:04)
overpriced because it's a tourist trap (62:02 - 62:06)
well everything's overpriced everything (62:04 - 62:08)
is spread out weird now (62:06 - 62:09)
and (62:08 - 62:12)
if you live here there is literally no (62:09 - 62:13)
no reason to go there's nothing unique (62:12 - 62:15)
in the mall of america anymore (62:13 - 62:17)
right there's just everything you can (62:15 - 62:19)
find everywhere else so it is really (62:17 - 62:21)
sort of just doubled down on being a (62:19 - 62:23)
tourist destination (62:21 - 62:25)
but because it's a tourist destination (62:23 - 62:29)
it is it is very bright they took very (62:25 - 62:31)
good steps to make sure you had outside (62:29 - 62:33)
light coming in (62:31 - 62:34)
and in the galleria mall i'm like (62:33 - 62:36)
there's a tiny (62:34 - 62:38)
weird angular (62:36 - 62:40)
window way up in the ceiling that is (62:38 - 62:42)
giving zero light (62:40 - 62:43)
it's just there so we went to the (62:42 - 62:45)
galleria because it was too cold outside (62:43 - 62:48)
it was called so this is the thing i'm (62:45 - 62:50)
curious because it was colder on (62:48 - 62:52)
saturday than it was on friday and i'm (62:50 - 62:54)
curious of how those people dealt with (62:52 - 62:56)
it because (62:54 - 62:58)
after friday (62:56 - 62:59)
we're not going back outside i ca i (62:58 - 63:02)
can't do it anymore (62:59 - 63:04)
when i was in the galleria we were (63:02 - 63:05)
walking for pikmin (63:04 - 63:07)
i was like (63:05 - 63:09)
maybe we just leave because this is also (63:07 - 63:13)
a miserable experience it's just like (63:09 - 63:14)
and (63:13 - 63:16)
mostly because like everything was so (63:14 - 63:18)
crowded and close there wasn't even that (63:16 - 63:20)
many people in the mall it just felt (63:18 - 63:21)
like you didn't have space to walk (63:20 - 63:24)
through this glorified hallway that they (63:21 - 63:26)
designed the layout and the way they (63:24 - 63:27)
built (63:26 - 63:29)
the center cuts (63:27 - 63:31)
they just didn't make the (63:29 - 63:34)
the actual walking areas very wide (63:31 - 63:37)
so if you had two people (63:34 - 63:39)
walking next to each other you already (63:37 - 63:41)
felt like you had nowhere to go like you (63:39 - 63:43)
were trapped behind these people until (63:41 - 63:45)
you could get one of the weird junctions (63:43 - 63:48)
to pull out around them it it was a it's (63:45 - 63:50)
a very dark and cramped mall (63:48 - 63:53)
um (63:50 - 63:53)
two out of ten (63:53 - 63:56)
oh (63:56 - 64:00)
no no it's still better than boston (63:57 - 64:03)
commons in arlington virginia that's at (64:00 - 64:05)
least a four out of five all right (64:03 - 64:07)
i'll give you a three three the sheer (64:05 - 64:09)
number of foot lockers that that mall (64:07 - 64:12)
felt the need to have (64:09 - 64:14)
for a two floor (64:12 - 64:16)
plus food court mall (64:14 - 64:18)
was that's where you need to look at (64:16 - 64:20)
your proportions and analysis what (64:18 - 64:21)
you're doing with your life (64:20 - 64:23)
yeah (64:21 - 64:25)
there was a lot there's a lot happening (64:23 - 64:27)
hey uh (64:25 - 64:29)
i'll tell you i i (64:27 - 64:31)
not this not pikmin podcast but i'm (64:29 - 64:32)
still having a great time with pikmin (64:31 - 64:34)
bloom (64:32 - 64:37)
you i think i i love your pikmin (64:34 - 64:38)
but (64:37 - 64:40)
i (64:38 - 64:43)
on friday i felt i had more fun with (64:40 - 64:47)
pikmin than i did with pokemon go (64:43 - 64:49)
only because (64:47 - 64:52)
i didn't have to keep tapping (64:49 - 64:54)
on things and running away from things i (64:52 - 64:57)
could just say you pikmin do this (64:54 - 64:59)
i'm putting the phone in my pocket i am (64:57 - 65:02)
putting my hands in my pocket and when i (64:59 - 65:04)
get to my next destination in three (65:02 - 65:06)
minutes i will pull out my hands and (65:04 - 65:08)
check on you and that was a good (65:06 - 65:11)
experience although (65:08 - 65:14)
going back to the galleria (65:11 - 65:16)
when i was walking my 10 000 steps for (65:14 - 65:18)
commute for that community day i was (65:16 - 65:20)
playing pokemon primarily (65:18 - 65:24)
so i'm curious (65:20 - 65:25)
that's the nice thing about pikmin is (65:24 - 65:26)
like you (65:25 - 65:28)
you you it just doesn't ask a lot of you (65:26 - 65:29)
yeah (65:28 - 65:32)
it work you can you can easily do both (65:29 - 65:33)
games (65:32 - 65:34)
because (65:33 - 65:37)
a pigment asked so little from you (65:34 - 65:38)
that it's like i'll just chicken on it (65:37 - 65:41)
every once in a while so i'd be i'd be (65:38 - 65:43)
curious what (65:41 - 65:46)
uh only pikmin player is doing but even (65:43 - 65:47)
if you're not playing pokemon like hey (65:46 - 65:49)
if i'm walking through a park playing (65:47 - 65:52)
pikmin i can check twitter i can send a (65:49 - 65:53)
text like (65:52 - 65:55)
i can listen to anything i want because (65:53 - 65:58)
i can like i can just walk (65:55 - 66:02)
yeah it it it's just a great little (65:58 - 66:02)
micro game i don't know yeah that's the (66:02 - 66:06)
call it's it's it's a really great (66:04 - 66:08)
companion to have running throughout the (66:06 - 66:10)
day for you and what happened with your (66:08 - 66:12)
battery is if you do find your little (66:10 - 66:14)
pickles to be too nice because i i did (66:12 - 66:17)
install the game knowing that no matter (66:14 - 66:20)
what i wanted to do with my life (66:17 - 66:22)
i would be doing pikmin community day (66:20 - 66:24)
and walking ten thousand steps (66:22 - 66:25)
and (66:24 - 66:27)
i it turns out i take a lot more steps (66:25 - 66:30)
than neither of these jews (66:27 - 66:30)
but what i have found is if you do find (66:31 - 66:35)
that the little pickles are too taxing (66:33 - 66:37)
with their always bringing you nectars (66:35 - 66:40)
and demanding attention you can send (66:37 - 66:42)
them on 10-day expeditions (66:40 - 66:43)
and just (66:42 - 66:44)
bye (66:43 - 66:46)

you (67:35 - 67:38)
don't be shy (67:36 - 67:39)
uh it's one of the highlights of the (67:38 - 67:42)
trip every time (67:39 - 67:43)
yeah i'm sorry to anyone on saturday and (67:42 - 67:45)
sunday i just could could not go back (67:43 - 67:48)
outside and i'm sure after their day of (67:45 - 67:51)
playing go they probably were like (67:48 - 67:53)
it's this sucks (67:51 - 67:56)
it was very cold (67:53 - 67:58)
um but yeah the (67:56 - 68:00)
the park was gorgeous the park was great (67:58 - 68:02)
the park was laid out super well like (68:00 - 68:05)
everything about the event was perfect (68:02 - 68:06)
in my eyes (68:05 - 68:09)
except the weather which (68:06 - 68:11)
can't control that nope (68:09 - 68:13)
so if if niantic's going to i mean (68:11 - 68:15)
niantic did say they want to get back to (68:13 - 68:16)
live events (68:15 - 68:17)
um (68:16 - 68:18)
and so if they're going to do more (68:17 - 68:20)
safari zones next year which i'd imagine (68:18 - 68:21)
they are (68:20 - 68:24)
and i imagine they're going to pick (68:21 - 68:27)
i i would i still think that they had a (68:24 - 68:30)
game plan because it was a game plan in (68:27 - 68:31)
the sense of like it was supposed to be (68:30 - 68:34)
liverpool and pittsburgh and st louis (68:31 - 68:35)
and that was like the early part of the (68:34 - 68:37)
year and then there was go fest and then (68:35 - 68:40)
there was nothing afterwards and i would (68:37 - 68:41)
i would (68:40 - 68:43)
imagine that probably the afterwards was (68:41 - 68:46)
like here's a bunch of southern states (68:43 - 68:49)
or west coast states that are more warm (68:46 - 68:51)
in the (68:49 - 68:53)
october november december (68:51 - 68:54)
because i (68:53 - 68:56)
st louis in november (68:54 - 68:59)
not a good time (68:56 - 68:59)
so i would i would imagine they're going (69:02 - 69:06)
to pick other cities and states to do (69:03 - 69:09)
more safari zones in 2022 (69:06 - 69:10)
and i'd be willing to go to them for (69:09 - 69:13)
sure just (69:10 - 69:13)
the weather is always a problem (69:13 - 69:18)
like when will and i did (69:16 - 69:19)
go fest (69:18 - 69:21)
the day we didn't play but we were still (69:19 - 69:22)
in town it poured (69:21 - 69:24)
yep absolutely (69:22 - 69:26)
and it sucked for those people and i (69:24 - 69:27)
think those people i'm almost positive (69:26 - 69:28)
those people got a makeup day (69:27 - 69:30)
um because that was the go fest where (69:28 - 69:32)
the chicago was like (69:30 - 69:34)
you need to clear out the park for at (69:32 - 69:36)
least oh yeah i remember that yeah (69:34 - 69:38)
um and people were mad at niantic and it (69:36 - 69:41)
was like this is a this is an actual (69:38 - 69:43)
safety concern and like (69:41 - 69:45)
niantic isn't going to go against the (69:43 - 69:47)
city of chicago for being like you need (69:45 - 69:49)
to evacuate people right now (69:47 - 69:51)
um (69:49 - 69:54)
so i i'm 100 for live events even though (69:51 - 69:56)
like this was like the worst weather (69:54 - 69:57)
slash (69:56 - 69:59)
kind of bummer experience in that (69:57 - 70:01)
regards like it didn't sour me on going (69:59 - 70:05)
to another live event no (70:01 - 70:06)
it was it (70:05 - 70:09)
despite everything weather-wise and (70:06 - 70:10)
other (70:09 - 70:13)
i i had a great time (70:10 - 70:16)
yes (70:13 - 70:16)
okay let's take one more break we got (70:16 - 70:20)
question of the week pokemon of the week (70:19 - 70:22)
and i think one more news article so we (70:20 - 70:25)
will be right back (70:22 - 70:25)
what is the nidoran supposed to be (70:27 - 70:32)
it's a mix of porcupine a rabbit (70:30 - 70:34)
dinosaurs mouse (70:32 - 70:37)
whales jackalope probably a horse and (70:34 - 70:41)
hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a (70:37 - 70:45)
mountain whales jackalopes (70:41 - 70:45)
[Music] (70:45 - 71:00)
jackalope probably a horse an hamster (70:57 - 71:04)
porcupine a rabbit dinosaur's a mouse (71:00 - 71:05)
whale (71:04 - 71:08)
jackalope probably a horse and hamster (71:05 - 71:11)
[Music] (71:08 - 71:15)
and we are back from our break uh just a (71:11 - 71:17)
couple things real quick (71:15 - 71:18)
probably probably some of the stuff (71:17 - 71:21)
we've already covered but um (71:18 - 71:23)
charge up for pokemon goes november (71:21 - 71:25)
community day starring shinx uh so that (71:23 - 71:28)
is from sunday november 21st from 11 to (71:25 - 71:29)
5. (71:28 - 71:31)
shanks will be appearing more frequently (71:29 - 71:33)
in the wild there will be a dollar (71:31 - 71:36)
research story for that (71:33 - 71:38)
so good luck getting your shinx's at (71:36 - 71:40)
least it's on sunday not saturday i (71:38 - 71:41)
guess that's (71:40 - 71:44)
better than what they did for chimchar (71:41 - 71:45)
two years ago (71:44 - 71:48)
[Laughter] (71:45 - 71:49)
um (71:48 - 71:52)
other pokemon news here is fusion strike (71:49 - 71:54)
is now available (71:52 - 71:56)
uh fusion strike will have cards such as (71:54 - 71:58)
mu v hoopa v genesect v (71:56 - 72:01)
deoxys that knows both fusion (71:58 - 72:03)
strike single strike and rapid strike (72:01 - 72:06)
all at once there's some new item cards (72:03 - 72:08)
as well (72:06 - 72:10)
uh and if you're having a hard time (72:08 - 72:12)
finding packs of fusion strike we know (72:10 - 72:15)
that they are available at the flying j (72:12 - 72:16)
yep (72:15 - 72:19)
at the flying j somewhere in iowa (72:16 - 72:21)
they had lots of fusion packs they had (72:19 - 72:23)
lots of fusions they sure did they had a (72:21 - 72:27)
whole display right next to the cheese (72:23 - 72:30)
i bought the cheese and not the fusion (72:27 - 72:32)
it was very jarring to see so many (72:30 - 72:34)
fusion strikes (72:32 - 72:38)
but you know what good on them yeah you (72:34 - 72:40)
know good i'm sure those truckers as (72:38 - 72:41)
soon as they got out of their shower at (72:40 - 72:43)
the flying j i'm sure they cracked a (72:41 - 72:45)
pack open yeah well they were there's a (72:43 - 72:46)
whole tournament going back in the back (72:45 - 72:49)
room with all the truckers (72:46 - 72:51)
uh other thing to announce here is (72:49 - 72:53)
pokemon unite battle pass three (72:51 - 72:56)
available this is dumb (72:53 - 72:57)
uh so (72:56 - 73:00)
this is the third battle pass that is (72:57 - 73:01)
true the first battle pass was called (73:00 - 73:04)
first half the second battle pass was (73:01 - 73:05)
called (73:04 - 73:07)
something second half (73:05 - 73:09)
uh it was not called second half (73:07 - 73:11)
ironically enough oh it's called uh (73:09 - 73:14)
galactic ghosts galactic ghosts 94 i (73:11 - 73:15)
think (73:14 - 73:18)
this battle pass is called sun sun sun (73:15 - 73:21)
or sun sun sunshine i think (73:18 - 73:23)
so it offers (73:21 - 73:26)
it offers a charizard (73:23 - 73:29)
outfit and then a venusaur outfit (73:26 - 73:31)
and (73:29 - 73:31)
we are it's called the sun sun sunshine (73:32 - 73:35)
so even though it's the third battle (73:34 - 73:39)
pass we are on season two of ranked (73:35 - 73:42)
so season one of ranked (73:39 - 73:44)
followed both the first two battle (73:42 - 73:46)
passes and it seems like season two of (73:44 - 73:49)
ranked are going to follow another two (73:46 - 73:50)
battle passes (73:49 - 73:52)
um so it seems that there will be two (73:50 - 73:54)
battle passes a season (73:52 - 73:58)
a ranked season which just feels to me (73:54 - 73:59)
that they're just like double dipping in (73:58 - 74:00)
battle passes (73:59 - 74:02)
yeah i don't (74:00 - 74:06)
like i couldn't finish galactic ghost (74:02 - 74:08)
i didn't either but also i didn't play (74:06 - 74:09)
as much (74:08 - 74:11)
i didn't play as much as well (74:09 - 74:13)
uh they did they did fix greedent (74:11 - 74:15)
i don't know how well they fixed green (74:13 - 74:16)
because i haven't played because they (74:15 - 74:18)
fixed green when we (74:16 - 74:20)
were headed to missouri yep um (74:18 - 74:22)
and so i i haven't watched any twitch i (74:20 - 74:24)
haven't really talked to anyone i (74:22 - 74:26)
haven't played it myself but i do know (74:24 - 74:27)
they fix gradient (74:26 - 74:29)
they fixed some other stuff i think they (74:27 - 74:31)
tweeted a day or two ago that nine tails (74:29 - 74:32)
was broken and they were planning on (74:31 - 74:34)
fixing nine tails in a day (74:32 - 74:36)
or or so (74:34 - 74:39)
um i don't know i still think unite is (74:36 - 74:41)
in a bad spot (74:39 - 74:43)
at least for the american audience i (74:41 - 74:45)
don't know how to do it yeah i don't (74:43 - 74:46)
know how i was doing in asia maybe it's (74:45 - 74:49)
doing great there they also announced (74:46 - 74:51)
what's happening on the 19th (74:49 - 74:52)

question of the week here we go again (75:42 - 75:50)
my my what will we answer (75:46 - 75:50)
the best part (75:51 - 75:56)
of the whole trip was torturing steve (75:53 - 75:59)
with greg and i singing the entire (75:56 - 76:02)
soundtrack to call porter's anything (75:59 - 76:06)
anything goes the whole abba's greatest (76:02 - 76:06)
karen carpenter was such a talent (76:10 - 76:14)
absolutely and i forget that she played (76:12 - 76:16)
the drums (76:14 - 76:17)
correct (76:16 - 76:18)
man (76:17 - 76:22)
gone too soon karen carpenter (76:18 - 76:22)
it was a it was a rough it was a rough (76:22 - 76:26)
experience it was not we played your (76:24 - 76:28)
k-pop for you when you're all pouty emo (76:26 - 76:31)

it we got it 200 a ticket (76:59 - 77:06)
patreon coming soon (77:02 - 77:08)
uh this is from uh alex if you could (77:06 - 77:11)
change any pokemon design who would it (77:08 - 77:13)
be and why (77:11 - 77:13)
uh dunsparce i'd make it less dumb (77:14 - 77:17)
looking (77:16 - 77:22)
[Laughter] (77:17 - 77:24)
there okay this is this is going to be (77:22 - 77:27)
controversial (77:24 - 77:27)
i would change (77:27 - 77:32)
rose raid's design (77:29 - 77:34)
what (77:32 - 77:35)
this is a controversy (77:34 - 77:37)
so the (77:35 - 77:40)
i i overall like the design but (77:37 - 77:43)
the roses on rosalia are so detailed and (77:40 - 77:46)
they lose all that detail on the (77:43 - 77:48)
bouquets like the bouquets aren't even (77:46 - 77:49)
separate they're like (77:48 - 77:51)
kind of a big lump (77:49 - 77:53)
and i really wish they would just (77:51 - 77:57)
add more detail into (77:53 - 78:00)
the whole bouquet part like it just (77:57 - 78:04)
it feels like they de-rezzed rosalia's (78:00 - 78:07)
arms when they went to rosarite so that (78:04 - 78:09)
is one thing that i just wish they would (78:07 - 78:11)
fix and i have seen people's online (78:09 - 78:13)
pictures and i don't like those either i (78:11 - 78:15)
don't know how to fix it (78:13 - 78:17)
but i do wish they would redesign that (78:15 - 78:20)
part of it also they could get rid of (78:17 - 78:22)
magnemite that the whole line is which (78:20 - 78:25)
is starting to stop whatever this is not (78:22 - 78:28)
about which pokemon would you remove uh (78:25 - 78:31)
they could keep it just redesign it (78:28 - 78:32)
there is like this weird thing they did (78:31 - 78:34)
with mega pokemon where they felt (78:32 - 78:37)
obligated to give mega pokemon goatees (78:34 - 78:42)
specifically aerodactyl and it looks bad (78:37 - 78:42)
and i hate it (78:42 - 78:46)
like mega aerodactyl i just can't get (78:44 - 78:48)
behind because of the weird goatee they (78:46 - 78:49)
gave to it (78:48 - 78:52)
and also (78:49 - 78:53)
mega (78:52 - 78:55)
venusaur (78:53 - 78:58)
is so boring compared to every other (78:55 - 79:01)
mega and then gigantomax venusaur is (78:58 - 79:05)
like what mega venusaur should have been (79:01 - 79:05)
well it turned out to be the gigantomax (79:06 - 79:11)
one (79:09 - 79:11)
i mean for me i know (79:12 - 79:16)
this is difficult for some people to (79:14 - 79:17)
hear (79:16 - 79:20)
and i want to preface by saying (79:17 - 79:23)
yes this pokemon is fun (79:20 - 79:26)
i i do i i firmly believe that this (79:23 - 79:29)
pokemon is appropriate and has a right (79:26 - 79:32)
to exist in the pokemon canon (79:29 - 79:33)
but (79:32 - 79:36)
i think both forms of hoopa look nothing (79:33 - 79:37)
like pokemon (79:36 - 79:40)
i i just think of all the pokemon that (79:37 - 79:42)
is the least pokemon looking pokemon (79:40 - 79:45)
i've ever seen hm (79:42 - 79:47)
hoopla and bounds a bit weird (79:45 - 79:49)
also (79:47 - 79:52)
change the design for jinx (79:49 - 79:54)
yeah just yeah just go right ahead go (79:52 - 79:57)
ahead and change jinx nobody will care (79:54 - 79:59)
just change it (79:57 - 80:00)
no one cares about magmar electabuzz (79:59 - 80:02)
anymore because they have evolutions (80:00 - 80:05)
just give jinx an evolution and make it (80:02 - 80:08)
a forgettable middle evolution again (80:05 - 80:08)
i don't know if they're weird about jinx (80:09 - 80:14)
anyways this is all for youtube (80:11 - 80:14)
you can leave a youtube comment if you (80:15 - 80:17)
want us to read it we don't read all of (80:16 - 80:19)
them so people are constantly (80:17 - 80:20)
disappointed (80:19 - 80:22)
disappointed (80:20 - 80:22)
um (80:23 - 80:26)
this is from litan brilliant diamond and (80:26 - 80:30)
shining pearl are coming out friday but (80:29 - 80:32)
on the 15th of november the date of this (80:30 - 80:33)
podcast episode sword and shield have (80:32 - 80:35)
been out for two years now that time has (80:33 - 80:36)
passed with the expansion passes have (80:35 - 80:37)
been out for a decent amount of time as (80:36 - 80:38)
well (80:37 - 80:39)
what are your thoughts on sword and (80:38 - 80:41)
shield have your opinions changed over (80:39 - 80:43)
time how do they compare to your initial (80:41 - 80:45)
expectation two years ago thanks love (80:43 - 80:47)
the podcast (80:45 - 80:48)
man i didn't know i was gonna have to do (80:47 - 80:49)
my (80:48 - 80:52)
phd dissertation defense as part of the (80:49 - 80:55)
program today (80:52 - 80:55)
uh (80:57 - 81:01)
all right so (80:58 - 81:03)
let's start with (81:01 - 81:04)
uh (81:03 - 81:06)
what are my thoughts on search my (81:04 - 81:08)
thoughts on shield haven't changed from (81:06 - 81:10)
when (81:08 - 81:12)
i first played them i found sword and (81:10 - 81:13)
shield (81:12 - 81:14)
and (81:13 - 81:16)
the gala region (81:14 - 81:18)
just a delightful region i thought they (81:16 - 81:20)
did a lot of very cool things (81:18 - 81:23)
i really liked overall all the pokemon (81:20 - 81:24)
designs (81:23 - 81:26)
um (81:24 - 81:29)
i i do think that the eye of armor (81:26 - 81:31)
really enhanced (81:29 - 81:34)
sword and shield i don't think crown (81:31 - 81:37)
tundra did the same level of enhancement (81:34 - 81:39)
um (81:37 - 81:39)
i think like (81:39 - 81:43)
a lot of what they did for isle of armor (81:41 - 81:45)
isle of armor is very varied it feels (81:43 - 81:46)
like it's got micro (81:45 - 81:49)
climates it feels like (81:46 - 81:51)
vibrant and kind of mazy (81:49 - 81:53)
and (81:51 - 81:58)
i feel like crown chandra is less (81:53 - 81:58)
all over the place like it's definitely (81:59 - 82:02)
easier to navigate which i appreciate (82:00 - 82:05)
but i feel like (82:02 - 82:08)
they didn't introduce as many (82:05 - 82:10)
new pokemon in there so it whenever i'm (82:08 - 82:12)
in the contour i'm running into things (82:10 - 82:14)
that i ran into the wild area before so (82:12 - 82:18)
crown tundra just feels less special (82:14 - 82:20)
on some levels and really (82:18 - 82:22)
i spend most of my time hanging out (82:20 - 82:25)
outside of the dynamics adventures store (82:22 - 82:29)
so like there's not a reason to go a lot (82:25 - 82:31)
further in and there wasn't like (82:29 - 82:34)
digging paw and digging ma in (82:31 - 82:37)
uh crown tundra so i i (82:34 - 82:41)
think the dlc on a whole enhanced my (82:37 - 82:43)
thoughts about sword and shield but not (82:41 - 82:45)
by much i still really think they're (82:43 - 82:49)
they're a very strong addition to (82:45 - 82:50)
the whole (82:49 - 82:53)
series like i think i i would put (82:50 - 82:57)
probably starting shield in my top five (82:53 - 82:59)
probably (82:57 - 82:59)
so for me i would say (83:01 - 83:06)
the concepts introduced in sword and (83:03 - 83:10)
shield the the the stadiums and bad that (83:06 - 83:12)
kind of battling and everything and (83:10 - 83:14)
having that be unique and that that was (83:12 - 83:17)
fantastic that incredibly fun (83:14 - 83:19)
it harkens to the original but it gives (83:17 - 83:21)
you something new a new way of looking (83:19 - 83:22)
at things (83:21 - 83:23)
i would say (83:22 - 83:26)
possibly the worst story of any pokemon (83:23 - 83:27)
game (83:26 - 83:30)
ever makes the least amount of sense of (83:27 - 83:34)
any pokemon game ever except (83:30 - 83:35)
that (83:34 - 83:37)
uh isle of armor and crown tundra had (83:35 - 83:39)
good stories (83:37 - 83:40)
that were interesting and fun to play (83:39 - 83:42)
through my little micro stories or (83:40 - 83:44)
however you want to look at them (83:42 - 83:45)
but overall (83:44 - 83:47)
two years later (83:45 - 83:50)
there is still stuff to do in sword and (83:47 - 83:53)
shield yeah the game has not run out it (83:50 - 83:55)
is a game that you can keep playing you (83:53 - 83:57)
can keep finding things to do there is (83:55 - 83:59)
so much content (83:57 - 84:02)
that i think it really surpasses other (83:59 - 84:05)
pokemon games with the amount of ongoing (84:02 - 84:07)
content the fact that they still have (84:05 - 84:08)
monthly events (84:07 - 84:12)
that are unique and timely and fun (84:08 - 84:14)
i think that is what's really (84:12 - 84:17)
outstanding (84:14 - 84:19)
yeah i i don't think my thoughts for (84:17 - 84:20)
sword and shield have changed i i (84:19 - 84:22)
definitely like the games a lot and i (84:20 - 84:25)
agree with will that the game still is (84:22 - 84:27)
offering something (84:25 - 84:29)
two years out (84:27 - 84:32)
um and you can like you you obviously (84:29 - 84:34)
make your own fun in pokemon games and (84:32 - 84:36)
do what you want to do but (84:34 - 84:39)
as much fun as i had with ultrasound (84:36 - 84:40)
ultra moon it was a lot of just shiny (84:39 - 84:42)
hunting (84:40 - 84:43)
and i got into a little bit of (84:42 - 84:46)
competitive battling near the end (84:43 - 84:49)
but all the steps they took to make (84:46 - 84:51)
competitive easier get to get into to (84:49 - 84:54)
keep changing it every couple months to (84:51 - 84:55)
uh (84:54 - 84:58)
not only change the rules but to like (84:55 - 85:00)
ban pokemon offer tournaments the (84:58 - 85:03)
players cup that kind of stuff like (85:00 - 85:04)
really just (85:03 - 85:07)
broke down so many barriers to get into (85:04 - 85:09)
competitive and to watch people play (85:07 - 85:12)
competitive even if you don't like it um (85:09 - 85:14)
and i think the thing that no one ever (85:12 - 85:16)
talks about with sword and shield uh (85:14 - 85:18)
compared to other pokemon games is that (85:16 - 85:21)
the world and the economy in the world (85:18 - 85:24)
just feels valuable like if you spend (85:21 - 85:26)
30 minutes going around the isle of (85:24 - 85:28)
armor picking up stuff it doesn't feel (85:26 - 85:30)
like it's a waste of time because you're (85:28 - 85:33)
going to use that stuff in some way (85:30 - 85:35)
um (85:33 - 85:35)
they've really also like (85:38 - 85:44)
captured a good way to make you come (85:42 - 85:47)
back once a month right like the special (85:44 - 85:49)
event raids (85:47 - 85:52)
are like okay i'll jump in for a bit (85:49 - 85:53)
you know i'll i'll test my luck i'll see (85:52 - 85:56)
what i get like (85:53 - 85:56)
it is they have sort of found a good (85:56 - 86:01)
sweet spot to keep you engaged with (85:59 - 86:04)
their game two years out which is is a (86:01 - 86:06)
pretty impressive thing yeah i think i (86:04 - 86:08)
mean it's been a year since crown tundra (86:06 - 86:10)
i still haven't caught all the legendary (86:08 - 86:12)
pokemon in the (86:10 - 86:15)
in the dynamics raids (86:12 - 86:16)
um (86:15 - 86:17)
i (86:16 - 86:19)
still haven't gotten reggie gigas yet in (86:17 - 86:22)
the crown tundra even though i i have (86:19 - 86:24)
all the reggies to activate that i (86:22 - 86:28)
i caught all of the gallerian birds in (86:24 - 86:30)
specific pokeballs and i wanted to do (86:28 - 86:32)
that again on my other copy in different (86:30 - 86:34)
pokeballs i (86:32 - 86:37)
still have (86:34 - 86:39)
so many loose ends (86:37 - 86:40)
to (86:39 - 86:41)
do (86:40 - 86:43)
and i won't be able to complete them (86:41 - 86:45)
when (86:43 - 86:47)
when diamond pro comes out i just and (86:45 - 86:48)
and (86:47 - 86:50)
i did do a lot of battling i did a lot (86:48 - 86:52)
of mark hunting i did a lot of (86:50 - 86:54)
raids i did a lot of dynamics adventure (86:52 - 86:57)
i did a lot of shiny hunting like i can (86:54 - 86:58)
i feel like i can keep naming things i (86:57 - 87:00)
did in sword and shield and after i beat (86:58 - 87:03)
ultra sun on moon i was like yeah i did (87:00 - 87:04)
rainbow rocket and then i just shiny (87:03 - 87:06)
hunted (87:04 - 87:06)
yeah and the thing that we know too (87:06 - 87:10)
though is that (87:08 - 87:13)
unless there's some real surprise that (87:10 - 87:15)
we we have not seen (87:13 - 87:17)
diamond and pearl is going to offer so (87:15 - 87:19)
much yeah and then it's gonna be like (87:17 - 87:22)
yeah you did your diamond in pearl right (87:19 - 87:24)
but i i was like i i still have stuff (87:22 - 87:25)
you're i'm the same i have stuff i have (87:24 - 87:27)
not finished the sword and shield that i (87:25 - 87:29)
know i will come back to yeah because i (87:27 - 87:32)
want to finish that stuff same (87:29 - 87:34)
yeah there's really nothing in (87:32 - 87:35)
ultrasound ultramoon that i need to go (87:34 - 87:37)
back to i have a bunch of shinies there (87:35 - 87:38)
that i want to get a couple ribbons on (87:37 - 87:40)
and then move them over but (87:38 - 87:42)
i don't really need to do anything new (87:40 - 87:43)
there (87:42 - 87:45)
um same with let's go i thought let's go (87:43 - 87:46)
is great (87:45 - 87:48)
but i played through let's go beat it (87:46 - 87:50)
caught my legendaries caught a bunch of (87:48 - 87:53)
shinies did a couple master rank but i i (87:50 - 87:55)
feel like i don't have a reason to go (87:53 - 87:57)
back there um and with sword and shield (87:55 - 87:58)
two years out (87:57 - 88:00)
i can think of a dozen reasons to go (87:58 - 88:02)
back to those games (88:00 - 88:04)
yep (88:02 - 88:04)
they are (88:05 - 88:06)
uh (88:06 - 88:08)
story aside because the story does not (88:06 - 88:10)
make any sense (88:08 - 88:12)
uh they are (88:10 - 88:15)
a very solid game (88:12 - 88:17)
i think they tried enough things that (88:15 - 88:19)
you kind of get that is hopeful for the (88:17 - 88:21)
future of the series (88:19 - 88:24)
uh but kept a lot of things (88:21 - 88:26)
very tight it felt comfortable (88:24 - 88:28)
comfortable while still feeling like oh (88:26 - 88:30)
the way they do gym sounds is really (88:28 - 88:32)
cool and this is kind of go like the (88:30 - 88:34)
wild area is really fun to be in i i (88:32 - 88:38)
think it hit a really good balance of (88:34 - 88:42)
making steps forward the way that (88:38 - 88:43)
all pokemon games barely make steps (88:42 - 88:46)
forward like this they did make a lot of (88:43 - 88:48)
solid steps forward that didn't really (88:46 - 88:50)
feel like they were detracting from the (88:48 - 88:52)
game (88:50 - 88:52)
well (88:54 - 88:57)
pokemon of the week well i mean it's (88:55 - 88:59)
more like pokemon of the month at this (88:57 - 89:02)
point has been going on for so long (88:59 - 89:05)
i just wanted people to understand me (89:02 - 89:08)
and what i was trying to get to (89:05 - 89:11)
uh so the second set of clues that i (89:08 - 89:12)
gave it's real short so i'll just read (89:11 - 89:14)
it here (89:12 - 89:17)
the pokemon delmise is 12 foot 10 inches (89:14 - 89:19)
or 3.9 meters tall (89:17 - 89:22)
uh and then it says why not dell mize (89:19 - 89:24)
why not ghost why not grass why not dark (89:22 - 89:27)
why not water must one be these things (89:24 - 89:29)
to hide within the shadowy nautical (89:27 - 89:31)
creature (89:29 - 89:33)
so what what do you guys got (89:31 - 89:36)
it's (89:33 - 89:39)
munchlax (89:36 - 89:39)
it's (89:39 - 89:45)
why not it is why not you are correct so (89:40 - 89:47)
let me just explain for the people who (89:45 - 89:49)
just because nobody really got it off (89:47 - 89:50)
the first clue (89:49 - 89:53)
so the first clue also very short this (89:50 - 89:55)
is a find the pokemon in the tall grass (89:53 - 89:57)
kind of clue on this cool october (89:55 - 89:59)
evening the shadowy nautical creature (89:57 - 90:02)
set out to deceive all right so (89:59 - 90:04)
a lot of people are like oh shadowy (90:02 - 90:08)
nautical creature that is del mais and (90:04 - 90:10)
then you have to go a little further (90:08 - 90:13)
this is a show your work gre level type (90:10 - 90:17)
question belle mize is a grass pokemon (90:13 - 90:20)
and i said find the pokemon in the tall (90:17 - 90:22)
grass if you look at the words (90:20 - 90:25)
shadowy which ends with wy (90:22 - 90:27)
and nautical which is right next to it (90:25 - 90:29)
which starts with n-a-u-t (90:27 - 90:32)
why not is in (90:29 - 90:35)
the tall grass creature (90:32 - 90:36)
all you had to do was break the words (90:35 - 90:39)
apart into their syllables i feel like (90:36 - 90:42)
it's hard on an audio podcast (90:39 - 90:43)
but i (90:42 - 90:46)
accentuated on the second time around (90:43 - 90:49)
when i said shadow we (90:46 - 90:53)
not nicole creature (90:49 - 90:55)
but there you go it was why not you are (90:53 - 90:59)
correct now you finally got to it (90:55 - 91:01)
in gen 3 why not is the only baby (90:59 - 91:03)
pokemon that can be found found in wild (91:01 - 91:05)
in the games on mirage island (91:03 - 91:07)
uh oddly in gen 4 why not is the only (91:05 - 91:09)
baby pokemon that can be cannot be found (91:07 - 91:11)
in the wild (91:09 - 91:13)
why not is the only (91:11 - 91:14)
gen 3 pokemon who made their debut (91:13 - 91:18)
before the diamond on pearl series sorry (91:14 - 91:20)
ruby and sapphire series (91:18 - 91:23)
why not has the lowest special attack of (91:20 - 91:26)
all psychic type pokemon (91:23 - 91:26)
great shiny okay shuffle like that i'm (91:27 - 91:31)
not a huge fan of the shovel icon good (91:29 - 91:35)
shiny much to why not yeah (91:31 - 91:37)
yeah he's cute (91:35 - 91:39)
very rare and go i don't know people (91:37 - 91:42)
want those shiny babies and go (91:39 - 91:42)
bobby buy those incubators you'll get (91:43 - 91:46)
them (91:45 - 91:48)
they're hard to get well you're going to (91:46 - 91:50)
get all the you get the bobby box (91:48 - 91:54)
right next month or later this month (91:50 - 91:55)
all right you ready for this week's i'm (91:54 - 91:59)
ready for this week born ready should be (91:55 - 92:00)
much easier (91:59 - 92:02)
so we're taking it down the power level (92:00 - 92:04)
down a little bit (92:02 - 92:08)
we recently had an error on this program (92:04 - 92:09)
as (92:08 - 92:11)
since the gala region was introduced (92:09 - 92:14)
tornadus is no longer the only mono (92:11 - 92:17)
flying type pokemon (92:14 - 92:19)
what i also find to be quite unique (92:17 - 92:20)
though (92:19 - 92:24)
is that all of the bird pokemon (92:20 - 92:26)
that for some unknown reason are both (92:24 - 92:28)
flying and normal type (92:26 - 92:31)
our normal type as their first or (92:28 - 92:34)
primary type while flying is actually (92:31 - 92:36)
their secondary type (92:34 - 92:39)
there are only two pokemon evolution (92:36 - 92:42)
lines and one pokemon with two alternate (92:39 - 92:45)
forms that have flying as their primary (92:42 - 92:49)
type and either dragon steel or water as (92:45 - 92:50)
their secondary type (92:49 - 92:54)
of these only one maintains the same (92:50 - 92:57)
first and second type before and after (92:54 - 92:59)
evolving (92:57 - 93:01)
if you wish to guess this week's pokemon (92:59 - 93:04)
of the week you must identify the very (93:01 - 93:07)
first dual type pokemon to have flying (93:04 - 93:10)
as its primary type (93:07 - 93:12)
