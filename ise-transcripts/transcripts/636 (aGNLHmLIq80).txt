I am am (0:00 - 0:04)
[Music] (0:04 - 0:16)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:14 - 0:17)
the (0:16 - 0:20)
636 episode of the Pokemon podcast it&#39;s (0:17 - 0:23)
super effective I&#39;m your host Steve with (0:20 - 0:27)
me is Hannah H hi I&#39;m here in the same (0:23 - 0:30)
place as when we last recorded (0:27 - 0:33)
yep (0:30 - 0:38)
travel Bobby also here hi I also in the (0:33 - 0:40)
same place when we last recorded (0:38 - 0:43)
although that is not as uh much of a (0:40 - 0:45)
surprise as it is for Hannah to be in (0:43 - 0:47)
the same place multiple times fair (0:45 - 0:48)
that&#39;s fair true the only time we&#39;ve (0:47 - 0:52)
ever gotten hand on the same place (0:48 - 0:54)
twice uh okay so like I if you listen to (0:52 - 0:58)
last week&#39;s episode it I&#39;ve said that (0:54 - 0:59)
I&#39;m traveling and this might be messy (0:58 - 1:01)
cuz we&#39;re trying to record too before I (0:59 - 1:03)
travel uh even though I&#39;m still taking (1:01 - 1:07)
my equipment with me just in case um but (1:03 - 1:10)
uh By the time this episode goes up the (1:07 - 1:15)
Embargo I signed uh should be lifted so (1:10 - 1:17)
that&#39;s perfect that&#39;s great because we (1:15 - 1:18)
have a whole episode to talk about (1:17 - 1:21)
Pokemon pocket which will probably be (1:18 - 1:26)
the majority of this episode (1:21 - 1:29)
so so uh there might be a YouTube video (1:26 - 1:31)
up specifically about Pokemon pocket (1:29 - 1:32)
depending on how much work I got done (1:31 - 1:35)
this week uh but that would just be like (1:32 - 1:39)
me without Hannah and Bobby and I think (1:35 - 1:41)
I&#39;m sure there I&#39;m sure Hannah and Bobby (1:39 - 1:44)
have a million questions about this game (1:41 - 1:46)
so before we get in just full disclosure (1:44 - 1:49)
the Pokemon company did pay for my (1:46 - 1:51)
flight and hotel to New York to play (1:49 - 1:53)
Pokemon pocket the other part of the (1:51 - 1:56)
disclosure is I don&#39;t have to talk about (1:53 - 1:58)
it I don&#39;t owe them anything I don&#39;t I (1:56 - 1:59)
didn&#39;t need to make a YouTube video I (1:58 - 2:01)
didn&#39;t need to make a podcast it I (1:59 - 2:03)
didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t need to do anything it (2:01 - 2:05)
was just we&#39;re inviting you out to play (2:03 - 2:08)
this game if you want to do stuff cool (2:05 - 2:11)
if you don&#39;t also cool so that&#39;s usually (2:08 - 2:12)
what it is the only time the Pokemon (2:11 - 2:13)
company at this point has ever made me (2:12 - 2:16)
like do something uh was worlds where I (2:13 - 2:19)
was required to tweet I think twice and (2:16 - 2:23)
then post on Instagram twice and then uh (2:19 - 2:25)
do a YouTube video which I would have (2:23 - 2:27)
done anyways they asked me to do things (2:25 - 2:30)
I would have already done so they kind (2:27 - 2:32)
of worked out um so yeah I went to New (2:30 - 2:36)
York I played Pokemon pocket um I played (2:32 - 2:39)
for like 3 hours uh actually they they (2:36 - 2:41)
pretty much gave us a I don&#39;t know I (2:39 - 2:43)
don&#39;t know it was like a Google pixel I (2:41 - 2:44)
don&#39;t know what kind of phone it was uh (2:43 - 2:47)
they G they they gave us a phone it (2:44 - 2:49)
wasn&#39;t a pixel I think it was actually a (2:47 - 2:51)
Samsung um got to get the phone right (2:49 - 2:53)
was it a Samsung Galaxy was it a Google (2:51 - 2:56)
pixel9 Ultra or X you are asking an (2:53 - 2:58)
iPhone person was it a fold was it a (2:56 - 3:01)
Google 9 fold it did not fold it did not (2:58 - 3:05)
flip it did not twist it did not B it uh (3:01 - 3:08)
there were three cameras on the back in (3:05 - 3:10)
a vertical format oh that was a Samsung (3:08 - 3:13)
then yeah yeah uh it it felt great like (3:10 - 3:16)
the phone wise good good build quality (3:13 - 3:18)
um I have I&#39;ve been to a bunch of (3:16 - 3:19)
Pokemon events in New York I feel like (3:18 - 3:20)
anytime I&#39;m if I&#39;ve ever Sayang I&#39;m (3:19 - 3:22)
going to New York it&#39;s probably because (3:20 - 3:24)
papa pikachu wants to show me something (3:22 - 3:27)
but when I played the DLC for scarlet (3:24 - 3:29)
and violet that was like maybe 30 (3:27 - 3:31)
minutes when I played Pokemon sleep that (3:29 - 3:34)
was here&#39;s a hotel room for the night (3:31 - 3:37)
play Pokemon sleep and (3:34 - 3:41)
then do the 15 minutes in the morning um (3:37 - 3:43)
this was the longest event they did they (3:41 - 3:44)
did a they did a (3:43 - 3:47)
presentation like a little like keynote (3:44 - 3:48)
PowerPoint kind of thing where they (3:47 - 3:52)
explained the game they gave us phones (3:48 - 3:54)
we could do whatever we wanted (3:52 - 3:56)
for uh it felt I think I think it was (3:54 - 4:01)
about 2 three hours um and (3:56 - 4:03)
in the games uh you could have like (4:01 - 4:06)
unlimited money so you could just keep (4:03 - 4:08)
buying coins or you could buy like the (4:06 - 4:11)
accessories so I want that phone yeah (4:08 - 4:13)
yeah give me that addition of the game (4:11 - 4:16)
with the unlimited money part and then (4:13 - 4:19)
um and then at the end of the day I (4:16 - 4:20)
think they broke us up into three groups (4:19 - 4:22)
because there was also media there like (4:20 - 4:24)
journalists and stuff so journalists (4:22 - 4:26)
some content creators there was three (4:24 - 4:31)
groups that got to sit in front of um (4:26 - 4:33)
one person from (4:31 - 4:35)
DNA I could be wrong I have to look at (4:33 - 4:36)
my notes they&#39;re not in front of me but (4:35 - 4:38)
I think it was one person from DNA two (4:36 - 4:40)
people from (4:38 - 4:43)
creatures and then one person from the (4:40 - 4:45)
Pokemon (4:43 - 4:47)
company [ __ ] not International the (4:45 - 4:50)
Pokemon company like oh okay wow uh they (4:47 - 4:52)
were all Japanese guys is what I&#39;m (4:50 - 4:54)
saying and they had the the translator (4:52 - 4:56)
uh we could ask them questions and they (4:54 - 4:59)
would answer and if we were told if they (4:56 - 5:01)
couldn&#39;t answer any questions somebody (4:59 - 5:03)
would step in and be like you can&#39;t (5:01 - 5:06)
answer that uh (5:03 - 5:09)
so uh I believe one of the creatures (5:06 - 5:12)
guys I interview or not interviewed but (5:09 - 5:15)
um when I was in Japan and po Pokemon (5:12 - 5:16)
brought me to creatures I believe it was (5:15 - 5:18)
one of the same guys I can&#39;t remember (5:16 - 5:20)
art director uh or something I&#39;ll I&#39;ll (5:18 - 5:22)
pull up the notes as we&#39;re talking and I (5:20 - 5:26)
have a bunch of notes the one rule we (5:22 - 5:30)
had uh and if if by again by by the time (5:26 - 5:31)
this podcast goes up there&#39;ll probably (5:30 - 5:33)
be a bunch of YouTube videos out from (5:31 - 5:36)
anyone who was invited to the event um (5:33 - 5:38)
the one role we had is we weren&#39;t (5:36 - 5:40)
allowed to record the phone (5:38 - 5:44)
itself which makes capturing content (5:40 - 5:45)
really weird because I could be like a I (5:44 - 5:47)
pulled the (5:45 - 5:50)
Pikachu was immersive Art card but like (5:47 - 5:54)
I can&#39;t show that I did yeah went able (5:50 - 5:57)
to get screen recordings no that was a (5:54 - 5:59)
very strict rule that you couldn&#39;t (5:57 - 6:01)
record (5:59 - 6:03)
the screen of the phone you could record (6:01 - 6:06)
yourself playing but like I mean but you (6:03 - 6:08)
couldn&#39;t show the screen at all if it&#39;s (6:06 - 6:12)
anything like TCG videos tend to be (6:08 - 6:14)
everybody just wants to see the reaction (6:12 - 6:15)
of someone that pulled something good (6:14 - 6:17)
anyway right so did you have any good (6:15 - 6:22)
reactions maybe um you can use those (6:17 - 6:26)
yeah no not really I mean like the the (6:22 - 6:29)
the space to play I mean I I make (6:26 - 6:31)
content different than other people make (6:29 - 6:33)
content obviously but the the the the (6:31 - 6:35)
space we played in was it was kind of (6:33 - 6:39)
like a rooftop bar area hosting event (6:35 - 6:41)
the same place where the switch when (6:39 - 6:43)
when they initially made the switch (6:41 - 6:45)
announcement and they had the commercial (6:43 - 6:46)
where the people see the other people on (6:45 - 6:48)
the rooftop having a party and they go (6:46 - 6:51)
bring the switch over there like that (6:48 - 6:54)
yeah yeah it was it was exactly like (6:51 - 6:57)
that we were all wearing very cool (6:54 - 7:00)
clothes we were very hip it was uh it (6:57 - 7:02)
was the same space as the Pokemon sleep (7:00 - 7:05)
event so you know they had like a little (7:02 - 7:07)
they had like um oh you know what they (7:05 - 7:08)
did have they had like the little finger (7:07 - 7:10)
food right they had people walking (7:08 - 7:12)
around with like little like shrimps and (7:10 - 7:15)
stuff very whatever um yeah they had (7:12 - 7:19)
like a open bar I guess um because some (7:15 - 7:22)
people got like wine uh but the the (7:19 - 7:25)
space was really small so when they sent (7:22 - 7:26)
us on our way to be like all right you (7:25 - 7:28)
got like two three hours to play the (7:26 - 7:29)
game you know play as much or little as (7:28 - 7:31)
you want a bunch of people just started (7:29 - 7:33)
recording themselves like talking and (7:31 - 7:35)
stuff so (7:33 - 7:38)
it&#39;s I don&#39;t make content like that like (7:35 - 7:40)
I I don&#39;t know I I just wanted to play (7:38 - 7:45)
the game and not be like on um and I (7:40 - 7:46)
just wanted to go through the game as (7:45 - 7:48)
much as possible to (7:46 - 7:51)
like get through as much as possible and (7:48 - 7:52)
then have like formulated thoughts (7:51 - 7:54)
afterwards and again if I have a YouTube (7:52 - 7:56)
video up it&#39;ll and you&#39;re watching on (7:54 - 7:57)
YouTube it&#39;ll be in the corner or (7:56 - 8:00)
something and you can watch that (7:57 - 8:05)
but um yeah I I think I also probably (8:00 - 8:07)
did the battling a lot more than other (8:05 - 8:10)
people I I did as many battles as I (8:07 - 8:11)
could there was a tutorial for that I&#39;m (8:10 - 8:14)
sure you guys will have questions about (8:11 - 8:17)
that but yeah I I played it for about (8:14 - 8:19)
two to three (8:17 - 8:23)
hours I I was sitting next to real (8:19 - 8:24)
breaking (8:23 - 8:28)
Nate um which is another TCG YouTuber (8:24 - 8:30)
and at one this this is this is how I (8:28 - 8:32)
feel about the game is what Nate said to (8:30 - 8:34)
me we&#39;ve been playing the game for about (8:32 - 8:37)
two hours and he looked at me and he (8:34 - 8:39)
goes I thought you would be more (8:37 - 8:42)
critical about (8:39 - 8:42)
this that&#39;s a good thing and I was like (8:44 - 8:50)
I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to find things to be (8:47 - 8:53)
critical about (8:50 - 8:56)
but it&#39;s better than I ever thought it (8:53 - 9:01)
would be wow it&#39;s like genu (8:56 - 9:03)
genuinely so (9:01 - 9:07)
good and I I am so excited for when it (9:03 - 9:11)
drops on October 30th like I I kind of (9:07 - 9:12)
thought (9:11 - 9:14)
like is it is it going to be more like (9:12 - 9:17)
Pokemon go where it&#39;s going to be like (9:14 - 9:19)
this secret huge hit and like so many (9:17 - 9:21)
people are going to download it and it&#39;s (9:19 - 9:23)
going to get carried away uh I was like (9:21 - 9:25)
it&#39;s going to be Pokemon Masters where (9:23 - 9:27)
people are excited for it like for like (9:25 - 9:28)
two weeks and then it like kind of had (9:27 - 9:30)
like a hard drop off (9:28 - 9:32)
um and obviously Masters reworked a lot (9:30 - 9:34)
of things since then um where I think (9:32 - 9:36)
Masters is in a good place but I don&#39;t (9:34 - 9:37)
think Masters did a good job at (9:36 - 9:39)
recapturing those people that initially (9:37 - 9:41)
played and then kind of fell off is it (9:39 - 9:42)
going to be Pokemon is it going to be (9:41 - 9:45)
like Pokemon sleep where it&#39;s like if (9:42 - 9:47)
you don&#39;t want to do the core thing of (9:45 - 9:50)
sleep you&#39;re already out right like yeah (9:47 - 9:53)
you&#39;re are like like Pokemon sleep has a (9:50 - 9:56)
big ask of players which is we want your (9:53 - 9:58)
sleeping data and that in itself is (9:56 - 10:00)
already going to turn away people (9:58 - 10:02)
I would argue that Pokemon go also has a (10:00 - 10:07)
big ask we want you to leave your house (10:02 - 10:09)
umh I&#39;ll tell you right now Pokemon (10:07 - 10:11)
pocket requires no sleeping or no (10:09 - 10:13)
walking (10:11 - 10:16)
so the barrier entry to that very very (10:13 - 10:17)
low in fact it&#39;s probably better if (10:16 - 10:19)
you&#39;re not walking or sleeping you (10:17 - 10:22)
probably play more of the game you (10:19 - 10:25)
can&#39;t uh (10:22 - 10:27)
and and I I would I would maybe say it (10:25 - 10:29)
seems like this launch is going to be (10:27 - 10:34)
very conservative in the way of (10:29 - 10:34)
like they have what they have in mind (10:34 - 10:39)
which is at the start it seems like it&#39;s (10:37 - 10:40)
going to be collecting there will be (10:39 - 10:42)
three different sets you can collect (10:40 - 10:45)
from um if you saw what I played at (10:42 - 10:47)
Worlds which was like just open a (10:45 - 10:48)
booster pack that was like the whole (10:47 - 10:50)
demo experience it&#39;s those three sets (10:48 - 10:52)
it&#39;s like a Charizard set a Mewtwo set (10:50 - 10:54)
and a Pikachu set I mean the point of (10:52 - 10:56)
the game is collection they said that (10:54 - 10:58)
the Pokemon and creatures both said this (10:56 - 11:00)
the the core (10:58 - 11:03)
concept of this game is to collect and (11:00 - 11:04)
to finish your (11:03 - 11:06)
collections and that while there is (11:04 - 11:09)
battling and the battling Works uh there (11:06 - 11:11)
there&#39;s no like ranked mode for battles (11:09 - 11:13)
there&#39;s no ladder to climb but I I don&#39;t (11:11 - 11:15)
think that&#39;s a bad thing I&#39;m talking a (11:13 - 11:16)
lot so I&#39;ll let you guys ask questions (11:15 - 11:19)
but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll Circle back to (11:16 - 11:19)
everything uh I guess I&#39;ll (11:21 - 11:26)
start so like yeah to your point just (11:24 - 11:29)
going off of that like when I looked at (11:26 - 11:32)
the Pokemon pocket website there is no (11:29 - 11:35)
mention of battling like the marketing (11:32 - 11:38)
is all in on collecting and they (11:35 - 11:40)
literally if you look at that website (11:38 - 11:42)
they don&#39;t mention the word battle in (11:40 - 11:44)
the website so yeah they haven&#39;t showed (11:42 - 11:47)
it off at all right so how is the (11:44 - 11:49)
battling I mean you just said it was (11:47 - 11:51)
good but like is it complex is it is it (11:49 - 11:54)
long games is it quick how is that it it (11:51 - 11:57)
is everything I want in TCG battling it (11:54 - 12:00)
is incredible and I cannot stress this (11:57 - 12:03)
enough it&#39;s so good and I know there (12:00 - 12:06)
were questions about like why does TCG (12:03 - 12:11)
live exist if pocket exists and they&#39;re (12:06 - 12:14)
so different um so for those that don&#39;t (12:11 - 12:16)
know TCG live is the current Pokemon (12:14 - 12:19)
online product that replaced Pokemon (12:16 - 12:21)
Trading Card Game (12:19 - 12:26)
online and it is full battles right it (12:21 - 12:29)
is your 60 card decks six prizes your (12:26 - 12:30)
time limit (12:29 - 12:33)
ranked mode there&#39;s no trading in that (12:30 - 12:35)
there is collecting but it&#39;s not really (12:33 - 12:37)
about collecting it is about if you have (12:35 - 12:38)
more than four cards you crush those (12:37 - 12:40)
cards into dust you buy the cards you (12:38 - 12:41)
don&#39;t need because you&#39;re building decks (12:40 - 12:43)
and you&#39;re battling that&#39;s it that&#39;s (12:41 - 12:45)
what live is live is not available in (12:43 - 12:47)
most Asian countries it&#39;s not available (12:45 - 12:49)
in Japanese at all (12:47 - 12:52)
um when you buy a pack of cards in (12:49 - 12:54)
America you will get a little Cod card (12:52 - 12:55)
you can redeem that code card to get (12:54 - 12:56)
packs in (12:55 - 12:59)
live the code cards do not work in (12:56 - 13:00)
pocket (12:59 - 13:03)
that question was asked to G I keep I (13:00 - 13:05)
keep wanting to say game freak that (13:03 - 13:07)
question was asked to creatures and the (13:05 - 13:09)
Pokemon company they have no plans of (13:07 - 13:11)
making those code cards to work there&#39;s (13:09 - 13:13)
actually nowhere in the app to even (13:11 - 13:17)
enter any kind of code that&#39;s a little (13:13 - 13:20)
surprising so it&#39;s the same for Masters (13:17 - 13:21)
and the same for Sleep there&#39;s just (13:20 - 13:24)
nowhere in those games to enter any (13:21 - 13:28)
promotional code at all um unite has a (13:24 - 13:30)
place for promotional codes and (13:28 - 13:34)
um yeah Pokemon go go does on Android (13:30 - 13:36)
they do not on iOS yes because of (13:34 - 13:40)
Apple&#39;s rules go online yeah yeah so (13:36 - 13:42)
there there&#39;s no place to enter codes so (13:40 - 13:44)
if you&#39;ve been waiting to save your code (13:42 - 13:46)
cards I got that that&#39;s your bad news (13:44 - 13:47)
that that&#39;s it there&#39;s no way there&#39;s no (13:46 - 13:49)
way to redeem those code cards I said (13:47 - 13:50)
for months I didn&#39;t think there was (13:49 - 13:52)
going to be because of this is being a (13:50 - 13:55)
worldwide product and those code cards (13:52 - 13:56)
are not (13:55 - 13:59)
worldwide at all so here&#39;s how the (13:56 - 14:03)
battles work they&#39;re 20 card decks so (13:59 - 14:07)
the regular format is 60 card decks you (14:03 - 14:10)
don&#39;t have any energy in your 20 card (14:07 - 14:13)
deck what happens is your game will (14:10 - 14:17)
generate one energy card a turn that&#39;s (14:13 - 14:20)
not in your deck and then you can place (14:17 - 14:23)
that energy on a Pokemon like normal so (14:20 - 14:25)
the energy is pulled outside of the deck (14:23 - 14:26)
and it&#39;s in the corner and it will (14:25 - 14:28)
generate now if you&#39;re just doing a pure (14:26 - 14:30)
fighting deck you&#39;re just going to get (14:28 - 14:32)
fighting energy if you&#39;re doing like a (14:30 - 14:35)
fighting electric deck the game will (14:32 - 14:40)
generate 50% fighting 50% electric oh (14:35 - 14:42)
and you can see the next energy coming (14:40 - 14:44)
up it&#39;s kind of like Tetris where you (14:42 - 14:46)
can like see the next block so like if (14:44 - 14:48)
you&#39;re playing fighting (14:46 - 14:50)
electric and you specifically need a (14:48 - 14:52)
fighting energy but the current energy (14:50 - 14:54)
you&#39;re getting is electric you can be (14:52 - 14:56)
like okay well I need one colorless one (14:54 - 14:57)
fighting so I&#39;ll place the electric here (14:56 - 14:58)
and then on the next turn I know I&#39;m (14:57 - 15:00)
getting fighting (14:58 - 15:02)
and then you can see the energy (15:00 - 15:03)
following that so you&#39;re always getting (15:02 - 15:07)
an energy every single turn which then (15:03 - 15:10)
your 20 card deck is just Pokemon and (15:07 - 15:13)
just trainers supporters stadiums all of (15:10 - 15:15)
that (15:13 - 15:17)
and (15:15 - 15:21)
um in a normal TCG game you can get you (15:17 - 15:24)
can get four of every card so you know (15:21 - 15:27)
four Blitzle for Ze Striker for rare (15:24 - 15:30)
candy for Professor Oaks for (15:27 - 15:34)
Biancas um obviously only one aec in (15:30 - 15:36)
this you can only have two of every card (15:34 - 15:39)
so two Blitzle two Z Striker so two (15:36 - 15:40)
Professor Oaks (15:39 - 15:44)
two ends the ends not in the game but (15:40 - 15:47)
like your supporter cards two like Poke (15:44 - 15:49)
Balls (15:47 - 15:50)
um (15:49 - 15:54)
and because of this because um oh there (15:50 - 15:57)
are also no prize cards so in in the (15:54 - 15:59)
main game again I&#39;m going just (15:57 - 16:00)
explaining this to people who maybe have (15:59 - 16:02)
not played the TCG cuz I think they&#39;ll (16:00 - 16:04)
want to play this because the current (16:02 - 16:07)
TCG can be very intimidating 60 cards (16:04 - 16:11)
six prizes um not just the current TCG (16:07 - 16:13)
the TCG in general has always been (16:11 - 16:16)
intimidating for some people yeah yeah (16:13 - 16:19)
so there are no prizes so normally in a (16:16 - 16:21)
TCG match you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re shuffling (16:19 - 16:24)
your 60 cards you&#39;re drawing seven once (16:21 - 16:26)
you have a basic Pokemon you&#39;re then (16:24 - 16:28)
taking six cards placing them face down (16:26 - 16:31)
for prizes um and that&#39;s you know some (16:28 - 16:32)
of your cards that you might need might (16:31 - 16:34)
be in your prizes this is there&#39;s no (16:32 - 16:36)
energy you have your 20 cards you (16:34 - 16:38)
Shuffle you draw I think you&#39;re drawing (16:36 - 16:42)
five um not seven and then when you get (16:38 - 16:45)
a knockout you get a point and the first (16:42 - 16:47)
a three points win so a regular Pokemon (16:45 - 16:50)
is one point and a EX Pokemon is two (16:47 - 16:52)
points so it makes games go relatively (16:50 - 16:54)
quick but you also kind of changes the (16:52 - 16:58)
way you think about how games work okay (16:54 - 17:01)
uh but in results it ends up being (16:58 - 17:06)
shorter um and it&#39;s it&#39;s really its own (17:01 - 17:08)
it&#39;s so it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s very different (17:06 - 17:10)
right 20 cards versus 60 cards it&#39;s (17:08 - 17:12)
different enough but it&#39;s (17:10 - 17:16)
still it still feels like Pokemon TCG in (17:12 - 17:19)
a way that&#39;s like probably similar to (17:16 - 17:21)
people who play Magic where they&#39;ll play (17:19 - 17:22)
Commander or they&#39;ll play standard magic (17:21 - 17:24)
or they&#39;ll play Legacy Magic or they&#39;ll (17:22 - 17:26)
play um yeah that&#39;s a really good I (17:24 - 17:28)
think I mean I haven&#39;t played magic in a (17:26 - 17:30)
while but feel like that&#39;s a really good (17:28 - 17:33)
comparison because I have been playing (17:30 - 17:36)
uh Marvel snap in preparation for (17:33 - 17:39)
Pokemon pocket to come out just to kind (17:36 - 17:41)
of compare them because a lot of us have (17:39 - 17:44)
been saying this sounds like snap um and (17:41 - 17:46)
I hadn&#39;t played it before and now that (17:44 - 17:48)
I&#39;m hearing how these battles actually (17:46 - 17:52)
work this sounds a lot more like Pokemon (17:48 - 17:54)
in a good way it doesn&#39;t sound like (17:52 - 17:56)
Marvel snap it sounds I mean like a (17:54 - 17:59)
similar game in some ways they&#39;re still (17:56 - 18:00)
quick (17:59 - 18:03)
battles um but this still just sounds (18:00 - 18:07)
like a reworked faster Pokemon TCG and a (18:03 - 18:10)
really really good way yeah I mean (18:07 - 18:11)
there&#39;s uh you know in the regular TCG (18:10 - 18:14)
you have a bench of five in this you can (18:11 - 18:16)
only have a bench of three so it does (18:14 - 18:19)
make you consider what to put down and I (18:16 - 18:21)
will I I also have to stress that like (18:19 - 18:23)
there are so many cards that are (18:21 - 18:26)
exclusive to pocket like cards that will (18:23 - 18:28)
not exist in the real world um like that (18:26 - 18:31)
m two card they showed off the immersive (18:28 - 18:36)
one yeah the the immersive one okay um (18:31 - 18:40)
and those cards will generate a totally (18:36 - 18:44)
different meta in Pocket because they&#39;re (18:40 - 18:48)
exclusive to pocket right uh which there (18:44 - 18:52)
is no ranked um so battlewise you can do (18:48 - 18:54)
uh random person in the world you can (18:52 - 18:57)
just play them battle them I don&#39;t know (18:54 - 18:58)
if there&#39;s rewards cuz when I went to go (18:57 - 19:00)
batt ATT somebody randomly there&#39;s no (18:58 - 19:02)
one to battle cuz it&#39;s only like the 20 (19:00 - 19:05)
people here playing right right um uh (19:02 - 19:07)
but there are no rewards uh you can (19:05 - 19:09)
battle a friend so I can just be like (19:07 - 19:10)
hey Bobby you want to battle uh and then (19:09 - 19:12)
there are AI battles uh just against the (19:10 - 19:16)
CPU I don&#39;t I not like AI is in like (19:12 - 19:20)
chat gbt like just like CPU battles and (19:16 - 19:22)
the CPU battles (19:20 - 19:26)
are um they have like uh that is kind of (19:22 - 19:28)
like Pokemon Masters they&#39;ll it it (19:26 - 19:30)
almost exactly like Pokemon Masters (19:28 - 19:33)
it&#39;ll say like easy or beginner and then (19:30 - 19:34)
then when you beat that it&#39;ll unlock (19:33 - 19:36)
novice and then when you beat that it&#39;ll (19:34 - 19:38)
unlock expert and then when you beat (19:36 - 19:40)
that unlock Super expert I don&#39;t know (19:38 - 19:41)
the the (19:40 - 19:44)
rankings so that that that is like right (19:41 - 19:47)
out of Pokemon masters of you know we (19:44 - 19:48)
want you to do a battle but if you don&#39;t (19:47 - 19:50)
like battling there&#39;s you can just do (19:48 - 19:52)
the easy mode like three times now the (19:50 - 19:56)
cool thing about the CPU battles is that (19:52 - 19:58)
they do come with rewards and there are (19:56 - 20:01)
missions like in Pokémon go of like you (19:58 - 20:02)
know how Pokémon go is like spin three (20:01 - 20:05)
stops or battle one trainer like the (20:02 - 20:06)
your daily missions will be like do one (20:05 - 20:08)
battle and so like you could just do the (20:06 - 20:10)
easy battle and then you get rewards for (20:08 - 20:12)
it and though you&#39;ll get missions every (20:10 - 20:15)
day um to do that so I went (20:12 - 20:19)
through um the like there&#39;s also like (20:15 - 20:21)
limited time missions which if you play (20:19 - 20:22)
Pokemon Masters this is exactly what (20:21 - 20:24)
Pokemon Masters do does they&#39;ll be like (20:22 - 20:26)
two weeks limited time battles against (20:24 - 20:29)
like Skyla or something so the limited (20:26 - 20:30)
time battles was against like some (20:29 - 20:34)
Lapras deck and uh I went through the (20:30 - 20:37)
easy I went through the the the medium (20:34 - 20:38)
or whatever I I went to the all the way (20:37 - 20:40)
to the hardest and the hardest is the (20:38 - 20:43)
first time I lost and I was doing just a (20:40 - 20:46)
grass deck uh but the Lapras was weak (20:43 - 20:48)
against electric so when I lost to (20:46 - 20:51)
Lapras at the final one it like (20:48 - 20:52)
suggested like you should maybe build an (20:51 - 20:54)
electric deck (20:52 - 20:56)
mhm uh and I built an electric Deck with (20:54 - 20:59)
like the auto deck thing like really (20:56 - 21:00)
easy to just say like I want electric (20:59 - 21:02)
and then just Auto build and it will (21:00 - 21:03)
take your cards and it will try to build (21:02 - 21:05)
you a deck that&#39;s cool and then you go (21:03 - 21:08)
back in and and you do it and you can do (21:05 - 21:10)
it and and not only that not only did I (21:08 - 21:12)
beat it on the hardest difficulty but (21:10 - 21:14)
you can beat it on the hardest (21:12 - 21:16)
difficulty or any other difficulty in (21:14 - 21:19)
certain ways so it will like for the (21:16 - 21:21)
Lapras it was like five achievements I (21:19 - 21:24)
think I wrote them down but one of them (21:21 - 21:26)
was like beat the Lapras on the hardest (21:24 - 21:29)
difficulty without taking damage and (21:26 - 21:31)
then you&#39;ll get bonus rewards so it (21:29 - 21:35)
gives you a reason to like go back and (21:31 - 21:38)
be like oh I want to do this again but (21:35 - 21:39)
uh I&#39;m going to try to do it with a (21:38 - 21:41)
different deck because I don&#39;t want to (21:39 - 21:44)
take any damage um let me see what we (21:41 - 21:47)
have here okay so it was called Lapras (21:44 - 21:51)
ex genetic Apex win a battle with no (21:47 - 21:54)
gold stars so none so a gold star is (21:51 - 21:57)
like rarer cards for you okay so it&#39;s (21:54 - 21:59)
saying beat this entire battle with just (21:57 - 22:02)
basic common and uncommon cards uh win a (21:59 - 22:05)
battle by 12 turns win a battle with the (22:02 - 22:08)
opponent getting no points win 10 or (22:05 - 22:10)
more battles this is a this is very (22:08 - 22:12)
Masters like do this thing 10 just do it (22:10 - 22:15)
10 times uh and then win 20 or more (22:12 - 22:17)
battles and I think it said the Lapras (22:15 - 22:20)
thing was like two weeks long um so I (22:17 - 22:22)
did that and I did obviously I didn&#39;t do (22:20 - 22:24)
20 battles there but I was like cool (22:22 - 22:26)
like I beat it like I beat it like three (22:24 - 22:30)
times after losing two it once um (22:26 - 22:31)
and then you get different rewards on (22:30 - 22:33)
like completing it but also completing (22:31 - 22:35)
those little submissions so even though (22:33 - 22:37)
there is no (22:35 - 22:39)
ranked (22:37 - 22:43)
um it seems like there like the battling (22:39 - 22:46)
is already great um and obviously when (22:43 - 22:49)
they add more cards or they add more um (22:46 - 22:52)
whatever that only gets easier and (22:49 - 22:55)
easier we did straight up ask them in (22:52 - 22:59)
our Q&amp;A if ranked battle was (22:55 - 23:02)
coming and their response was pretty (22:59 - 23:07)
much we know that certain players will (23:02 - 23:10)
want and will want a ranked battle mode (23:07 - 23:14)
so we we&#39;re we&#39;re thinking about it okay (23:10 - 23:17)
which is like very specific yeah yes but (23:14 - 23:20)
it actually makes sense after playing it (23:17 - 23:22)
why they wouldn&#39;t launch with a ranked (23:20 - 23:25)
mhm one because like they want to make (23:22 - 23:29)
sure the game is working but two after (23:25 - 23:33)
spending $200 of fake currency right (23:29 - 23:36)
like I just bought the $100 thing twice (23:33 - 23:38)
in the game cuz it was like free because (23:36 - 23:41)
it was in demo mode right and I (23:38 - 23:44)
opened a bunch of cards when I was going (23:41 - 23:47)
against that lais deck I didn&#39;t have (23:44 - 23:52)
like a electric EX Pokemon right so like (23:47 - 23:55)
I couldn&#39;t build a better deck against (23:52 - 23:57)
the Lapras just cuz I didn&#39;t have the (23:55 - 23:58)
cards for it so I actually think it&#39;s (23:57 - 24:00)
really smart not to launch with rank I (23:58 - 24:01)
don&#39;t know if this I think this is (24:00 - 24:04)
intentional M because like if you launch (24:01 - 24:06)
with a rank right away all you&#39;re going (24:04 - 24:08)
to do is encourage a bunch of people to (24:06 - 24:10)
just spend as much money as possible to (24:08 - 24:13)
get as many cards as possible to then go (24:10 - 24:15)
unranked and just dominate people who (24:13 - 24:18)
didn&#39;t and I think the safer and smarter (24:15 - 24:20)
thing is like let&#39;s just like let the (24:18 - 24:23)
game exist for four and five months yeah (24:20 - 24:25)
let people build up collections without (24:23 - 24:29)
that stress of (24:25 - 24:31)
needing to spend money and then when we (24:29 - 24:33)
launch a rank people will have decent (24:31 - 24:35)
Siz collections at this point and now (24:33 - 24:37)
they can go into ranked without feeling (24:35 - 24:40)
like it&#39;s paid to win well and on top of (24:37 - 24:42)
that they&#39;ll they&#39;re letting people (24:40 - 24:45)
learn how to play the game right so even (24:42 - 24:49)
if you&#39;ve played the TCG for years you (24:45 - 24:51)
know this is different than that so it&#39;s (24:49 - 24:53)
learning a new strategy it&#39;s learning (24:51 - 24:55)
how to play this game and I think it&#39;s (24:53 - 24:58)
better to do that without people trying (24:55 - 25:00)
to jump right into ranked battles so (24:58 - 25:02)
everybody kind of has an equal playing (25:00 - 25:05)
field of learning how to play the game (25:02 - 25:07)
and then you know down the road they (25:05 - 25:09)
introduce ranked and it&#39;s like cool if (25:07 - 25:10)
you&#39;ve been playing the game now we&#39;re (25:09 - 25:12)
all kind of in the same place where we (25:10 - 25:14)
know how this works and we can jump into (25:12 - 25:17)
ranked and play it that way versus like (25:14 - 25:19)
just going right off the bat and not (25:17 - 25:21)
really knowing what you&#39;re doing and (25:19 - 25:22)
then you know and that&#39;ll still happen (25:21 - 25:24)
that would still happen down the road it (25:22 - 25:26)
get new people to play but like at least (25:24 - 25:28)
you&#39;d have a a foundational player base (25:26 - 25:30)
that knows what they&#39;re doing to start (25:28 - 25:32)
and then would be able to jump in that (25:30 - 25:35)
way yeah jumping in rank is at least (25:32 - 25:37)
from my experiences and things like (25:35 - 25:40)
Pokemon go or Marvel snap kind of gets (25:37 - 25:43)
demoralizing once you hit kind of the (25:40 - 25:45)
first ceiling of where your skill level (25:43 - 25:48)
is at and especially if it&#39;s right in (25:45 - 25:49)
the beginning while you&#39;re still kind of (25:48 - 25:51)
learning how to play and kind of (25:49 - 25:54)
learning The Meta I think that this is (25:51 - 25:57)
good for the beginning of the game yeah (25:54 - 25:59)
I think I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s really (25:57 - 26:01)
smart for them to be like we just want (25:59 - 26:03)
to make sure that people enjoy I think (26:01 - 26:05)
that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t advertised the (26:03 - 26:07)
battles that much yeah because I think (26:05 - 26:09)
there will be a big this is just me (26:07 - 26:11)
guessing and based off the questions (26:09 - 26:12)
I&#39;ve asked and their (26:11 - 26:15)
responses um it it does make it seem (26:12 - 26:17)
like yeah we know people will want (26:15 - 26:20)
ranked and it will probably eventually (26:17 - 26:22)
come we can&#39;t say that though but it (26:20 - 26:25)
does seem like when ranked does come it (26:22 - 26:29)
will be a big update and it will be EXC (26:25 - 26:31)
for those people who want it but I think (26:29 - 26:33)
it is just I don&#39;t think it needs to be (26:31 - 26:35)
there at launch I think people need to (26:33 - 26:38)
build up their collections uh and then (26:35 - 26:40)
even though like you know decks are only (26:38 - 26:42)
20 and you only need two of two like I (26:40 - 26:47)
said I opened I opened probably 50 or 60 (26:42 - 26:50)
packs and I didn&#39;t get any electric EX (26:47 - 26:52)
Pokemon that I could put in my electric (26:50 - 26:56)
deck right um so I don&#39;t even know if (26:52 - 26:59)
there were e ex Electric Pokemon but the (26:56 - 27:01)
Lapras was weak against electric so (26:59 - 27:06)
that&#39;s what I built right uh so 20 card (27:01 - 27:08)
decks makes a lot of sense especially (27:06 - 27:10)
with being able to open two packs a day (27:08 - 27:13)
for free what is how many cards are in (27:10 - 27:15)
each pack I mean I know you did the (27:13 - 27:17)
thing before you opened it but yeah it&#39;s (27:15 - 27:18)
the same they didn&#39;t change that each (27:17 - 27:22)
pack is five cards yep okay um you to to (27:18 - 27:25)
answer the question about like every two (27:22 - 27:28)
packs a day it is every 12 hours like we (27:25 - 27:29)
suspected (27:28 - 27:32)
um oh okay so you you just don&#39;t get to (27:29 - 27:35)
like log in and and be like oh here&#39;s my (27:32 - 27:37)
two packs I&#39;ll see you tomorrow uh I (27:35 - 27:42)
believe they said there is um not like (27:37 - 27:44)
a there there is a timer to it so how (27:42 - 27:47)
Packs work is the game I want to compare (27:44 - 27:50)
this the most to is Clash (27:47 - 27:52)
Royale um I don&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s (27:50 - 27:53)
played Clash Royale but it is (27:52 - 27:56)
technically a card game where you build (27:53 - 27:59)
a deck out of cards and then you place (27:56 - 28:00)
those cards in like the playing field (27:59 - 28:01)
and then it turns into a little guy and (28:00 - 28:03)
then they walk across right it&#39;s like a (28:01 - 28:05)
combination of like a tower defense SL (28:03 - 28:07)
card game but your decks in Clash Royale (28:05 - 28:09)
are cards but everything in Clash Royale (28:07 - 28:12)
is timer based and so like when you when (28:09 - 28:15)
you do like a little uh chest to open up (28:12 - 28:16)
it&#39;ll say this chest will open in six (28:15 - 28:18)
hours this chest will open up in 12 (28:16 - 28:22)
hours y your pack of cards in TCG pocket (28:18 - 28:26)
is it&#39;ll say 12 hours and that&#39;s where (28:22 - 28:28)
the money aspect comes so you can spend (28:26 - 28:30)
money money just like in Clash Royale to (28:28 - 28:34)
make that pack of cards open (28:30 - 28:36)
quicker um and then I think if you let (28:34 - 28:38)
it go 12 hours it will then start the (28:36 - 28:41)
next 12 hours so you can at least bank (28:38 - 28:44)
one pack got it so if you do come back (28:41 - 28:46)
in 24 hours after opening a pack you (28:44 - 28:48)
should have two packs there but a the (28:46 - 28:51)
the next pack won&#39;t start ticking until (28:48 - 28:53)
you open at least one of them that got (28:51 - 28:56)
it okay um so if you don&#39;t play the game (28:53 - 28:58)
for a week it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to (28:56 - 28:59)
you you&#39;re just not going to hold 14 (28:58 - 29:01)
packs you&#39;re just going to hold the two (28:59 - 29:06)
right right um so does that mean I maybe (29:01 - 29:08)
you don&#39;t know the answer to this one (29:06 - 29:09)
but does that mean that none of us are (29:08 - 29:11)
going to actually be able to play on day (29:09 - 29:13)
one because we have we don&#39;t have 20 (29:11 - 29:15)
card decks yet I&#39;m sure they have a (29:13 - 29:17)
starter deck there I think there are two (29:15 - 29:19)
starter decks you can just use okay got (29:17 - 29:21)
it and then I think you can go into the (29:19 - 29:23)
starter decks and adjust a couple cards (29:21 - 29:26)
cool okay (29:23 - 29:29)
um I I think we could talk about the (29:26 - 29:32)
money aspect which is I there&#39;s I I (29:29 - 29:34)
guess the one it&#39;s not even that a (29:32 - 29:35)
negative but I I guess it could be a (29:34 - 29:37)
negative there&#39;s a lot of currencies in (29:35 - 29:40)
this game um sounds about right for a (29:37 - 29:41)
mobile game (29:40 - 29:45)
yeah there are let me just double check (29:41 - 29:48)
here sounds about right for aese mobile (29:45 - 29:51)
yeah there are four currency there are (29:48 - 29:54)
five currencies I think five so there&#39;s (29:51 - 29:56)
shop tickets obtained by completing (29:54 - 29:59)
missions or set up battle can redeemed (29:56 - 30:01)
for cosmetic items and accessories (29:59 - 30:03)
there&#39;s emblem tickets obtained by (30:01 - 30:06)
completing themed collection or Dex (30:03 - 30:10)
missions a DEX Mission might be like (30:06 - 30:14)
collect four rodent Pokemon that may (30:10 - 30:16)
look like Pikachu right so it&#39;s like ah (30:14 - 30:20)
Den toaru right there&#39;s those those can (30:16 - 30:22)
be the emblem tickets can be redeemed (30:20 - 30:24)
for emblems that can be added to the (30:22 - 30:27)
player profile there&#39;s special shop (30:24 - 30:29)
tickets which can be obtained by (30:27 - 30:32)
consuming High Rarity cards in my cards (30:29 - 30:34)
these can be redeemed for special (30:32 - 30:37)
accessories and then there&#39;s event shop (30:34 - 30:39)
tickets which can be obtained by (30:37 - 30:41)
completing event missions disappearing (30:39 - 30:43)
after a certain time I think that would (30:41 - 30:44)
be like the lapas thing I gave an (30:43 - 30:47)
example of right can be redeemed for (30:44 - 30:49)
limited time accessories and then (30:47 - 30:51)
there&#39;s the thing that you can actually (30:49 - 30:55)
buy which is pokey (30:51 - 30:59)
gold um and the (30:55 - 31:03)
Pokey gold one Pokey gold can reduce the (30:59 - 31:08)
weight time to open a pack by two hours (31:03 - 31:13)
okay and so since a pack is 12 hours (31:08 - 31:17)
that&#39;s six Pokey gold technically right (31:13 - 31:20)
you also get pack hour glasses which can (31:17 - 31:23)
also reduce the pack time and The (31:20 - 31:26)
Hourglass will be used before the Pokey (31:23 - 31:28)
gold is spent so you would get the hour (31:26 - 31:30)
glasses from like doing your daily (31:28 - 31:34)
missions or like doing the battles um (31:30 - 31:39)
and then five Pokey gold would be 99 (31:34 - 31:42)
Cents I did the math on this because I (31:39 - 31:44)
bought a lot of (31:42 - 31:47)
cards ultimately a booster pack in this (31:44 - 31:49)
game is going to be about (31:47 - 31:53)
a120 which to me is way cheaper than I (31:49 - 31:55)
thought it was going to be yeah honestly (31:53 - 31:57)
that&#39;s not bad sure but you can&#39;t spend (31:55 - 32:01)
a dollar 20 you have to buy a pack of 99 (31:57 - 32:05)
so you have to buy basically $2 worth (32:01 - 32:07)
yeah and then you have some left over in (32:05 - 32:10)
order to do that so there is there is a (32:07 - 32:14)
um open one pack or open 10 packs and (32:10 - 32:15)
you can open 10 packs at once and the (32:14 - 32:19)
animation for that is so cool um it is (32:15 - 32:22)
like the one thing DNA who is the (32:19 - 32:24)
developer of this game also made Pokemon (32:22 - 32:26)
Masters they&#39;re very good at like (32:24 - 32:28)
opening things and and the nois and the (32:26 - 32:31)
sounds and the animation so cool opening (32:28 - 32:36)
10 packs so opening 10 packs would be um (32:31 - 32:40)
about $12 to open that and and just to (32:36 - 32:42)
put in perspective a regular booster (32:40 - 32:44)
pack right now if you walk into Target (32:42 - 32:47)
or Walmart or Best Buy or GameStop is $5 (32:44 - 32:49)
and that&#39;s 10 cards so that&#39;s why I (32:47 - 32:51)
thought like really a booster pack was (32:49 - 32:53)
GNA be like $250 or (32:51 - 32:56)
$3 but it&#39;s a $120 a booster pack it&#39;s (32:53 - 32:58)
about $12 for 10 booster packs again (32:56 - 33:01)
there&#39;s no easy way to get $10 because (32:58 - 33:04)
that would be 60 Gold but the $10 (33:01 - 33:07)
purchase is only for 50 (33:04 - 33:11)
gold because a $5 or a $1 purchase is (33:07 - 33:13)
for five gold right so you you do get (33:11 - 33:15)
like I think if you buy I wrote this (33:13 - 33:18)
down I think if you buy 50 (33:15 - 33:20)
gold you know how like all mobile games (33:18 - 33:22)
is like if you buy the more you buy the (33:20 - 33:25)
more bonus stuff it adds on yeah MH so (33:22 - 33:30)
if you buy yes 99 cents is five $9.99 is (33:25 - 33:32)
50 but you get plus seven so you&#39;re (33:30 - 33:38)
three Pokey gold short of 10 packs you (33:32 - 33:40)
need 60 for that and then (33:38 - 33:42)
$99 (33:40 - 33:46)
is500 plus a Dollar Plus (33:42 - 33:48)
190 (33:46 - 33:52)
um so uh there (33:48 - 33:55)
were like Pokemon unite did this where (33:52 - 33:57)
it was like your first time purchase you (33:55 - 34:00)
get like double the amount of poke gold (33:57 - 34:02)
or whatever so there is that at the top (34:00 - 34:03)
like first time purchase get extra poke (34:02 - 34:07)
gold and then the normal price is 99 (34:03 - 34:12)
Cents for five $10 for 57 and then $100 (34:07 - 34:13)
for (34:12 - 34:19)
uh or 690 so can the Poke gold be used (34:13 - 34:21)
to purchase anything else or is it only (34:19 - 34:26)
to make time uh for packs basically oh (34:21 - 34:28)
that&#39;s a good question um yeah the (34:26 - 34:32)
answer is yes (34:28 - 34:34)
um yeah when you you mentioned (34:32 - 34:36)
accessories and cosmetics earlier and (34:34 - 34:39)
haven&#39;t talked about that too much is (34:36 - 34:42)
that let&#39;s take a break and when we come (34:39 - 34:46)
back I will talk about the the way this (34:42 - 34:48)
game will make money I don&#39;t think is (34:46 - 34:50)
packs I think the way this game will (34:48 - 34:53)
make money is limited time (34:50 - 34:56)
Cosmetics that you will want and they (34:53 - 34:58)
will disappear in two weeks (34:56 - 35:00)
I think that&#39;s how this game makes the (34:58 - 35:03)
most money so we will be right back and (35:00 - 35:07)
we are back from our break uh okay (35:03 - 35:10)
Cosmetics uh (35:07 - 35:11)
so there (35:10 - 35:12)
[Music] (35:11 - 35:16)
are things you can buy using the four (35:12 - 35:20)
different tickets I described uh so for (35:16 - 35:23)
example uh there are there are some (35:20 - 35:27)
supporters and item cards you can buy oh (35:23 - 35:28)
so like if you were like oh I I just (35:27 - 35:31)
need um I just need like the Koga (35:28 - 35:33)
supporter you could just buy those out (35:31 - 35:36)
for two tickets like I said you can earn (35:33 - 35:39)
tickets by just playing the game um the (35:36 - 35:42)
emblems like changing just your profile (35:39 - 35:45)
picture uh those were 100 (35:42 - 35:48)
tickets um and I think they had like a (35:45 - 35:50)
they had like a Pikachu one a Charizard (35:48 - 35:51)
one a Mewtwo one they were matching kind (35:50 - 35:53)
of like the booster packs that exist (35:51 - 35:55)
right did they all cost money or did you (35:53 - 35:57)
have a selection of free ones you have (35:55 - 36:01)
six free ones um when you start the game (35:57 - 36:02)
I think one was like a Pikachu one was (36:01 - 36:06)
an Eevee one was a Slowpoke um there are (36:02 - 36:08)
Co there were coins and sleeves card (36:06 - 36:09)
sleeves you could buy those were 12 (36:08 - 36:12)
tickets uh the playmat was 26 tickets (36:09 - 36:15)
and then there was like a backdrop slash (36:12 - 36:17)
um (36:15 - 36:19)
cover which was seven tickets I&#39;m (36:17 - 36:23)
actually not 100% sure what those did MH (36:19 - 36:27)
um and then also in the store there was (36:23 - 36:30)
a Gore bundle that was (36:27 - 36:33)
$22.99 so that came with a gardav war (36:30 - 36:36)
coin a gardav war playmat a deck box (36:33 - 36:38)
some sleeves other stuff and then it (36:36 - 36:43)
also came with 120 gold as well oh and (36:38 - 36:44)
they said that this Gore bundle was (36:43 - 36:49)
limited for two weeks MH but the gardav (36:44 - 36:51)
war bundle doesn&#39;t come with any gardav (36:49 - 36:52)
War (36:51 - 36:55)
cards access Cosmetics that&#39;s why this (36:52 - 36:57)
is why I think before the break I&#39;m I (36:55 - 37:02)
think the way this game is going to make (36:57 - 37:06)
cuz you could probably easily spend 300 (37:02 - 37:10)
bucks you have nothing to do now at when (37:06 - 37:13)
you complete the sets on this mobile (37:10 - 37:16)
game that&#39;s something but yeah but like (37:13 - 37:19)
when I think of like collecting or the (37:16 - 37:22)
TCG stuff like I would spend at least (37:19 - 37:24)
$200 every 3 months I would buy two (37:22 - 37:27)
booster boxes that&#39;s what like 70 some (37:24 - 37:28)
packs I would open them all up and then (37:27 - 37:30)
I would be like oh $200 and I&#39;m not even (37:28 - 37:32)
close to completing this collection (37:30 - 37:35)
that&#39;s true uh Yep this is why I never (37:32 - 37:40)
got into TCG yeah uh so I I (37:35 - 37:42)
think I I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to (37:40 - 37:45)
bring up like spend $300 and you&#39;re done (37:42 - 37:47)
I think this game is so free to play (37:45 - 37:49)
friendly and the the way they are (37:47 - 37:51)
charging money is just cosmetics and it (37:49 - 37:53)
really reminds me of something like Apex (37:51 - 37:54)
Legends where it&#39;s like you can just (37:53 - 37:56)
play the whole game for free but if you (37:54 - 37:58)
want your octane to have a different (37:56 - 38:01)
skin $20 now your octane looks different (37:58 - 38:03)
and that&#39;s it like it doesn&#39;t make you a (38:01 - 38:04)
better player it doesn&#39;t like change (38:03 - 38:06)
anything it&#39;s like purely cosmetic so (38:04 - 38:07)
like you can play this whole game for (38:06 - 38:09)
free but if you really love gardav war (38:07 - 38:10)
and you&#39;re having a good time with the (38:09 - 38:12)
game and in the two weeks before this (38:10 - 38:15)
gardav war thing goes away you&#39;re like I (38:12 - 38:17)
want to give this game money uh I do (38:15 - 38:19)
think they&#39;re just going to rotate out (38:17 - 38:23)
these bundles yeah um and they they do (38:19 - 38:25)
show like when I&#39;m battling the computer (38:23 - 38:27)
I had like the EV playmat so when it was (38:25 - 38:29)
my turn the whole like board like (38:27 - 38:31)
flipped over and it went back to Eevee (38:29 - 38:32)
and then when it was their turn it like (38:31 - 38:34)
flipped back to them and went to their (38:32 - 38:36)
playmat so it&#39;s like really cool (38:34 - 38:41)
animations on how it works yeah um so (38:36 - 38:44)
sorry to back up a little bit like we&#39;re (38:41 - 38:46)
talking about like so you&#39;re saying um (38:44 - 38:48)
you know if you spent $300 let&#39;s say you (38:46 - 38:49)
did you know you let&#39;s say you did (38:48 - 38:53)
complete a set did they say whether sets (38:49 - 38:56)
are going to go away or like when the (38:53 - 38:59)
next sets come out will the initial sets (38:56 - 39:01)
still be around to open o that&#39;s a good (38:59 - 39:03)
question that was not (39:01 - 39:06)
asked really no one asked that one asked (39:03 - 39:09)
that now that TCG like collector (39:06 - 39:12)
specific the do these go away yeah I (39:09 - 39:15)
don&#39;t think they would go away the one (39:12 - 39:17)
of the questions that was asked was Will (39:15 - 39:20)
how frequently will sets come out and (39:17 - 39:24)
will they be tied to IRL sets so like if (39:20 - 39:26)
what&#39;s the next set coming out with (39:24 - 39:28)
Sparks if surging Sparks comes out are (39:26 - 39:29)
you releasing an equivalent to surging (39:28 - 39:31)
Sparks in the game and they said no they (39:29 - 39:33)
have no plans to coordinate or line up (39:31 - 39:35)
with the current TCG they will release (39:33 - 39:38)
sets at a pace that feels correct and it (39:35 - 39:39)
seemed like they genuinely didn&#39;t know (39:38 - 39:41)
the answer like we don&#39;t know how fast (39:39 - 39:43)
people rip through sets or like we don&#39;t (39:41 - 39:48)
know if it&#39;s too soon or or or in a lot (39:43 - 39:50)
of ways this is a whole new (39:48 - 39:52)
game yeah (39:50 - 39:55)
mhm (39:52 - 39:58)
uh there were also other limited time (39:55 - 40:00)
things that you could not spend money on (39:58 - 40:04)
but that would go away so for example (40:00 - 40:06)
they had um with your premium tickets (40:04 - 40:08)
which was one of the four currencies I (40:06 - 40:11)
talked about with the premium tickets (40:08 - 40:15)
you could cash those in for a Meowth set (40:11 - 40:17)
so it was like a Meowth coin a Meowth (40:15 - 40:20)
card playmat a Meowth binder like pretty (40:17 - 40:23)
much everything I say is like coin (40:20 - 40:25)
sleeves playmat uh and it was the Meowth (40:23 - 40:28)
that was the Meowth feature in like the (40:25 - 40:30)
I think it was like either jungle or (40:28 - 40:32)
fossil it was like the meow like licking (40:30 - 40:36)
his paw on the pile of coins yep so that (40:32 - 40:38)
was limited time but you couldn&#39;t spend (40:36 - 40:40)
real money to get it you need to just (40:38 - 40:43)
spend tickets to get it and then there (40:40 - 40:47)
was also uh with other (40:43 - 40:50)
tickets um there was a Mewtwo one so (40:47 - 40:54)
that Mewtwo immersive card there was uh (40:50 - 40:58)
deck box card sleeves playmat of that (40:54 - 41:01)
Mewtwo immersive card that would also be (40:58 - 41:03)
limited time of like this is going to go (41:01 - 41:05)
away and you need to spend the premium (41:03 - 41:07)
tickets for that (41:05 - 41:10)
too you me you said a word and I just (41:07 - 41:12)
want to like make sure that it wasn&#39;t an (41:10 - 41:16)
accidental maybe it was you said a (41:12 - 41:18)
binder did you mean to say something (41:16 - 41:19)
else or do you actually can you actually (41:18 - 41:21)
get a binder when then you have a binder (41:19 - 41:24)
you open yes there there are B I didn&#39;t (41:21 - 41:25)
do the binder thing I didn&#39;t know where (41:24 - 41:27)
to find it uh but there are binders that (41:25 - 41:29)
you can put your collection in a (41:27 - 41:32)
specific binder that&#39;s cool oh that&#39;s (41:29 - 41:33)
really cool there was (41:32 - 41:37)
also have to you don&#39;t uh I think if you (41:33 - 41:38)
don&#39;t change the binder cover it just (41:37 - 41:41)
says like genetic Apex Pikachu genetic (41:38 - 41:43)
Apex it&#39;s just a generic binder but you (41:41 - 41:46)
can custom binder or like a themed (41:43 - 41:50)
binder yes there&#39;s also a place in the (41:46 - 41:56)
game where you can present a card and I (41:50 - 41:57)
think they said you can present up to (41:56 - 41:59)
eight cards so if one of your friends (41:57 - 42:02)
goes to your profile they can see like (41:59 - 42:04)
your top eight cards that you&#39;ve (42:02 - 42:08)
presented and you can get like a a (42:04 - 42:13)
different cases to put those eight Cards (42:08 - 42:16)
into and that is more Cosmetics that you (42:13 - 42:20)
can like purchase or earn so you can (42:16 - 42:21)
have you can have a friends list of a (42:20 - 42:23)
100 people and if I click on Bobby&#39;s (42:21 - 42:25)
profile I could be like oh Bobby pulled (42:23 - 42:29)
the genetic Mewtwo but also he has the (42:25 - 42:33)
Mewtwo case that it&#39;s in in his like (42:29 - 42:36)
room mhm yep they they just started they (42:33 - 42:38)
really went all out they started doing (42:36 - 42:41)
that in in the real TCG there are (42:38 - 42:43)
collection boxes where that you can buy (42:41 - 42:47)
now that come with a um they&#39;re they&#39;re (42:43 - 42:49)
like these magnetic cases they they sell (42:47 - 42:51)
like regular clear ones but they they (42:49 - 42:53)
have these ones that are like it&#39;s (42:51 - 42:55)
themed so like there&#39;s a Charizard (42:53 - 42:56)
collection box and the case is like a (42:55 - 42:59)
fire type so it&#39;s like fire the design (42:56 - 43:00)
of the case is like fire type and you (42:59 - 43:02)
can put your Charizard or whatever or (43:00 - 43:04)
anything in there but it just feels very (43:02 - 43:07)
much like that so it&#39;s kind of themed (43:04 - 43:10)
customized look when people look at your (43:07 - 43:13)
stuff so if you have a hundred friends (43:10 - 43:15)
on your friends list what all can you do (43:13 - 43:17)
with those (43:15 - 43:20)
friends um from my understanding you can (43:17 - 43:22)
send them a (43:20 - 43:24)
battle you can look at their (43:22 - 43:27)
Collections and maybe you can trade them (43:24 - 43:31)
the one thing that was not working was (43:27 - 43:34)
the trading it was completely grayed out (43:31 - 43:38)
and we were told beforehand that a lot (43:34 - 43:40)
of questions regarding trading would (43:38 - 43:42)
probably be shot down as no as they (43:40 - 43:44)
don&#39;t want to talk about trading right (43:42 - 43:46)
now so the the game will not launch with (43:44 - 43:48)
trading just to be clear which is wild (43:46 - 43:50)
because it was very heavily part of the (43:48 - 43:56)
first trailer for this game yes um they (43:50 - 43:58)
said trading is coming Trading (43:56 - 44:00)
but it&#39;s it&#39;s not (43:58 - 44:03)
launching (44:00 - 44:03)
uh there were questions asked about (44:03 - 44:08)
trading that they didn&#39;t shut down so (44:05 - 44:10)
one of the questions (44:08 - 44:13)
was do I have to be standing next to the (44:10 - 44:17)
person to trade and their response was (44:13 - 44:19)
you do not need to be standing next to (44:17 - 44:22)
them to (44:19 - 44:22)
trade I don&#39;t know what that means right (44:22 - 44:30)
is there still a certain distance gated (44:27 - 44:32)
distance that was that was not the best (44:30 - 44:37)
worded question I don&#39;t it their answer (44:32 - 44:38)
was very specific though so I don&#39;t (44:37 - 44:40)
think if we we worded it any different (44:38 - 44:42)
they they they were pretty much like you (44:40 - 44:45)
don&#39;t need to be local to trade which in (44:42 - 44:46)
the trailer they showed somebody trading (44:45 - 44:49)
on a bus right when the other person was (44:46 - 44:52)
in a coffee shop so I don&#39;t know this is (44:49 - 44:53)
just speculation I don&#39;t know if they (44:52 - 44:55)
need to be on your friends list or you (44:53 - 44:58)
need to be friends for seven days or is (44:55 - 44:59)
there even a cooldown on trading can you (44:58 - 45:03)
only trade once every 24 hours or right (44:59 - 45:06)
can you like there&#39;s so many questions (45:03 - 45:09)
about trading (45:06 - 45:09)
that they wouldn&#39;t have answered if we (45:09 - 45:13)
asked but they did honestly they (45:11 - 45:15)
probably haven&#39;t worked through it all (45:13 - 45:19)
yet but if the feature is not done uh (45:15 - 45:20)
but you don&#39;t have to be standing next (45:19 - 45:22)
to the person the question I asked which (45:20 - 45:23)
I will take credit for because the (45:22 - 45:28)
entire room went o after I asked it (45:23 - 45:31)
so I know the question was good uh I (45:28 - 45:35)
said if I go to Korea and I trade (45:31 - 45:37)
somebody I&#39;m standing next to in Korea (45:35 - 45:39)
because I&#39;m just assum I assumed that it (45:37 - 45:41)
was like local trade right I go to I go (45:39 - 45:43)
all the way to South Korea I&#39;m trading (45:41 - 45:46)
my genetic Mewtwo for their genetic (45:43 - 45:49)
Mewtwo their Mewtwo is obviously in (45:46 - 45:53)
Korean mine is in English do I get that (45:49 - 45:54)
Korean Mewtwo or does it change to (45:53 - 45:57)
English for me and they did answer it (45:54 - 45:59)
and they said you will get the Korean (45:57 - 46:03)
Mewtwo and it will be in your yes and it (45:59 - 46:06)
will be a Korean Mewtwo in your game and (46:03 - 46:09)
so you can collect all the languages (46:06 - 46:12)
that they said that will work um but the (46:09 - 46:13)
only time the language will change is (46:12 - 46:16)
when you&#39;re in battle it will change to (46:13 - 46:18)
English by default and then outside of (46:16 - 46:21)
battle it will still be in Korean That&#39;s (46:18 - 46:23)
So Co so you can still play it you can (46:21 - 46:24)
still play it no matter what language (46:23 - 46:26)
it&#39;s in but then you get to collect it (46:24 - 46:28)
in that language that&#39;s why the room (46:26 - 46:31)
went they were also that was the only (46:28 - 46:34)
time I&#39;m so proud of my question that (46:31 - 46:36)
was the only time I saw them smile too (46:34 - 46:38)
like they were like genuinely excited (46:36 - 46:41)
that somebody asked that question oh (46:38 - 46:44)
yeah that is yes that is amazing that is (46:41 - 46:48)
a detail that is so important honestly (46:44 - 46:50)
oh I&#39;m so glad wow that&#39;s so cool so (46:48 - 46:53)
again I don&#39;t that that really opens up (46:50 - 46:56)
like the do I just friend somebody in (46:53 - 46:58)
Brazil and do we just trade every day so (46:56 - 46:59)
I can start collecting Portuguese cards (46:58 - 47:02)
like it really does open up like how (46:59 - 47:05)
does trading work but um I&#39;m surprised (47:02 - 47:07)
they answered that question since we (47:05 - 47:09)
were strictly told like they don&#39;t want (47:07 - 47:10)
to talk about trading at all but they (47:09 - 47:13)
were very excited to they were happy to (47:10 - 47:14)
tell you that answer because it&#39;s such a (47:13 - 47:17)
good an that&#39;s such a good (47:14 - 47:19)
feature uh yeah they just told us the (47:17 - 47:23)
trade is coming soon there is like a (47:19 - 47:25)
trading thing that it&#39;s not a trading (47:23 - 47:27)
thing they show it in the the preview (47:25 - 47:28)
but they don&#39;t explain it it&#39;s called (47:27 - 47:31)
like wonder trade or whatever mhm um (47:28 - 47:32)
ultimately like every day there will be (47:31 - 47:36)
a Wonder spot and um do you know uh (47:32 - 47:38)
what&#39;s that guy&#39;s name in Pokemon go (47:36 - 47:40)
Mato you know how Mato just trades you (47:38 - 47:43)
somebody&#39;s random gift it&#39;s exactly that (47:40 - 47:45)
for but TCG you will see somebody&#39;s (47:43 - 47:48)
random booster pack that they opened and (47:45 - 47:51)
you will see those five cards and then (47:48 - 47:53)
if you want to participate those five (47:51 - 47:55)
cards will get shuffled and then you can (47:53 - 47:57)
pick one of those five cards so if those (47:55 - 48:00)
five cards have like uh a card you don&#39;t (47:57 - 48:03)
have you&#39;re doing like a 20% chance that (48:00 - 48:05)
you might get that card every day and (48:03 - 48:07)
obviously if it&#39;s a pack of five cards (48:05 - 48:08)
you already have you probably just wait (48:07 - 48:10)
until that refreshes for something else (48:08 - 48:12)
but it&#39;s supposed to be like a random (48:10 - 48:16)
person&#39;s pack in the world will you will (48:12 - 48:18)
see and if you want to participate you (48:16 - 48:20)
will spend currency that you will earn (48:18 - 48:23)
just by playing the game uh to open a (48:20 - 48:25)
Wonder pack which is I mean obviously if (48:23 - 48:27)
there&#39;s like five cards and you don&#39;t (48:25 - 48:28)
have any of them that&#39;s 100% chance (48:27 - 48:30)
you&#39;re getting a card you don&#39;t have (48:28 - 48:32)
yeah um a lot of people seemed excited (48:30 - 48:34)
about it it just seemed like its version (48:32 - 48:36)
of Mato its version of wonder trade its (48:34 - 48:40)
version of surprise trade um that is (48:36 - 48:42)
like another way to get you to come back (48:40 - 48:44)
to the game to check to be like oh what (48:42 - 48:45)
is today&#39;s (48:44 - 48:48)
wonder wonder exchange Wonder it&#39;s (48:45 - 48:51)
Wonder something (48:48 - 48:54)
um Wonder pick is what it&#39;s called (48:51 - 48:56)
Wonder pick it&#39;s not the word I would (48:54 - 48:57)
have thought but okay (48:56 - 48:59)
uh somebody asked a question of like is (48:57 - 49:02)
it what it like how does it determine (48:59 - 49:04)
the person next to us it&#39;s and they just (49:02 - 49:05)
were like it&#39;s completely random so it&#39;s (49:04 - 49:07)
not like if you&#39;re standing next to like (49:05 - 49:08)
Bobby and Bobby just opened a pack that (49:07 - 49:10)
I could be like oh let me wonder pick (49:08 - 49:12)
from your pack maybe in the future it&#39;ll (49:10 - 49:13)
be like you can Wonder pick from your (49:12 - 49:15)
friends list or something but it just (49:13 - 49:17)
seemed like trade hopefully in the (49:15 - 49:19)
future you could just trade from yeah (49:17 - 49:20)
you could just trade yeah this just (49:19 - 49:22)
seemed like its version of like surprise (49:20 - 49:25)
trade or or or Mato yeah that&#39;s cool (49:22 - 49:28)
which honestly sounds good because to is (49:25 - 49:30)
fine we&#39;ve had the ability to friend (49:28 - 49:32)
people all over the world for a while (49:30 - 49:35)
now so it&#39;s not that exciting I would (49:32 - 49:37)
say in Pokemon go and wonder trade in (49:35 - 49:41)
the main Series games is kind of risky (49:37 - 49:43)
so I like the sound of this yeah yes (49:41 - 49:45)
yeah definitely um real quick question (49:43 - 49:48)
though when you open your pack what (49:45 - 49:50)
determines which pack you&#39;re opening (49:48 - 49:51)
like is it there are three sets out (49:50 - 49:53)
right now when you open your daily pack (49:51 - 49:54)
do you get to pick one of the three sets (49:53 - 49:56)
or do you okay so you do get to pick (49:54 - 49:57)
each time it&#39;s not you&#39;re not just (49:56 - 49:59)
randomly getting one of the pack no no (49:57 - 50:00)
yeah you got you got to completely pick (49:59 - 50:03)
what you want to open okay got it um (50:00 - 50:05)
they do show offering rates they have to (50:03 - 50:09)
legally now um so Pokemon Masters shows (50:05 - 50:12)
the offering rates (50:09 - 50:14)
uh I&#39;m trying to think of what else (50:12 - 50:16)
technically Niantic doesn&#39;t have to (50:14 - 50:20)
because of how that works (50:16 - 50:23)
uhhuh interesting (50:20 - 50:26)
yeah because you&#39;re not like buying eggs (50:23 - 50:29)
you&#39;re just getting them and yeah yeah (50:26 - 50:31)
okay Niantic is doing a loophole for the (50:29 - 50:35)
record but like yeah I think (50:31 - 50:39)
so um there are offering rates so your (50:35 - 50:41)
first three so five card five cards in a (50:39 - 50:43)
pack the first three are not never going (50:41 - 50:46)
to be anything exciting sure um the (50:43 - 50:50)
fourth slot has a (50:46 - 50:55)
2.57% chance of a gold star card a 0.5% (50:50 - 50:59)
chance of a two gold star card a 222% (50:55 - 51:02)
chance of a three gold star card and (50:59 - 51:04)
then (51:02 - 51:06)
a. (51:04 - 51:09)
40% chance of a gold crown Gold Crown (51:06 - 51:12)
being the rarest card of them all okay (51:09 - 51:14)
the fifth (51:12 - 51:18)
slot uh is a 10% chance for a one gold (51:14 - 51:22)
star 2% chance for a two gold star 8.88% (51:18 - 51:27)
chance for a three gold star and16 (51:22 - 51:29)
percent of a chance for a gold crown (51:27 - 51:34)
card so can either slot be the same (51:29 - 51:37)
card that&#39;s a good question like no one (51:34 - 51:40)
ask that so because this this is very (51:37 - 51:42)
reminiscent obviously of the actual (51:40 - 51:45)
physical packs right you&#39;re G to get (51:42 - 51:47)
seven quote unquote B I&#39;m gonna say (51:45 - 51:49)
boring but they&#39;re not boring I like so (51:47 - 51:52)
they&#39;re common uncommon cards yeah and (51:49 - 51:54)
then your eighth slot nowadays your (51:52 - 51:55)
eighth slot you have a chance at an AP (51:54 - 51:57)
speec uh your ninth slot you have a (51:55 - 52:00)
chance at a two star or a three star you (51:57 - 52:01)
know it&#39;s the illustration rare slot and (52:00 - 52:03)
then your 10th slot you have a chance at (52:01 - 52:05)
a full art or like an irregular ex but (52:03 - 52:07)
you can&#39;t get an illustration R in the (52:05 - 52:09)
10th slot you can only get one in the (52:07 - 52:11)
ninth slot so like in this game could (52:09 - 52:15)
you get like say that immersive Pikachu (52:11 - 52:18)
in the fourth or fifth slot or you only (52:15 - 52:21)
gonna okay yes because the immersive (52:18 - 52:27)
Pikachu is a three gold star card mhm um (52:21 - 52:29)
um and I can&#39;t I I know what the Gold (52:27 - 52:31)
Crown cards are um for each cuz you can (52:29 - 52:33)
so when you when you look at the (52:31 - 52:35)
offering rates you can see the card next (52:33 - 52:37)
to it so like they&#39;re not hidden like (52:35 - 52:40)
you know what the Gold Crown card is (52:37 - 52:44)
sure just like in Masters you know like (52:40 - 52:48)
uh Mass Royale is like a 0.25 s% chance (52:44 - 52:50)
or whatever in this pack um I&#39;m not (52:48 - 52:51)
allowed to talk about any cards they (52:50 - 52:54)
haven&#39;t officially shown but okay got it (52:51 - 52:57)
um but yeah the Gold Crown is the rare (52:54 - 53:00)
rist but the genetic Mewtwo they showed (52:57 - 53:02)
and the Pikachu illustration they showed (53:00 - 53:04)
those are both the the ones you dive (53:02 - 53:06)
into M those are not crowns those are (53:04 - 53:09)
three stars I just makes I just wonder (53:06 - 53:11)
why the different why the percentages (53:09 - 53:12)
are different then so like if it&#39;s a (53:11 - 53:15)
fourth slot three star three gold star (53:12 - 53:17)
card that percentage was different than (53:15 - 53:19)
the fifth slot three gold star card the (53:17 - 53:22)
fourth slot is more rare and the fifth (53:19 - 53:25)
slot is more more of a chance to get the (53:22 - 53:28)
rare stuff but you could get you could (53:25 - 53:30)
get two gold crowns in a pack it&#39;s just (53:28 - 53:34)
the fourth slot would be (53:30 - 53:38)
0.4 z% of a chance and then in the fifth (53:34 - 53:39)
slot it&#39;s a (53:38 - 53:42)
0.16% of a chance that&#39;s so interesting (53:39 - 53:43)
to me that they do it that way so like (53:42 - 53:45)
you could get the immersive Pikachu in (53:43 - 53:46)
the fourth or fifth slot but like (53:45 - 53:47)
there&#39;s just a better chance you&#39;re (53:46 - 53:49)
going to get it in the fifth slot than (53:47 - 53:52)
the fourth slot exctly exactly yep okay (53:49 - 53:54)
um and there is (53:52 - 53:56)
no nothing is changing so it&#39;s like if (53:54 - 53:59)
if you&#39;re missing like the gold if (53:56 - 54:00)
you&#39;re missing the immersive Pikachu (53:59 - 54:02)
let&#39;s say you got like 200 of the other (54:00 - 54:04)
cards it doesn&#39;t like increase your (54:02 - 54:06)
chance of getting the immersive Pikachu (54:04 - 54:08)
the numbers are the numbers right (54:06 - 54:10)
there&#39;s no like there is pity in the (54:08 - 54:14)
game where if you spend enough (54:10 - 54:17)
points you can cash that in for a card (54:14 - 54:19)
that you don&#39;t have I don&#39;t know how (54:17 - 54:22)
many points that is but there is no (54:19 - 54:25)
like my luck is getting better the more (54:22 - 54:29)
I pull just in your mind just in your (54:25 - 54:31)
mind uh and speaking of polling on packs (54:29 - 54:35)
uh there is a limit um so you are only (54:31 - 54:37)
allowed (54:35 - 54:38)
only (54:37 - 54:42)
uh you are only allowed to spend 720 (54:38 - 54:47)
gold a day to reduce pack (54:42 - 54:51)
opening I want to say that 500 gold is (54:47 - 54:54)
$99 uh-huh so you are allowed to spend (54:51 - 54:55)
about (54:54 - 54:58)
$150 a day before the game goes you&#39;ve (54:55 - 54:59)
spent too much (54:58 - 55:02)
gold you need to wait that&#39;s actually (54:59 - 55:05)
kind of surprising to me um not because (55:02 - 55:08)
I expect many people to spend $750 a day (55:05 - 55:12)
on one mobile game but it&#39;s not out of (55:08 - 55:13)
the realm of Poss you know like there (55:12 - 55:16)
are people who that&#39;s (55:13 - 55:19)
not that much money to them so like it&#39;s (55:16 - 55:22)
kind of surprising that they do cap (55:19 - 55:25)
it uh (55:22 - 55:28)
yeah um (55:25 - 55:28)
yeah I could I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if (55:29 - 55:33)
so what what I said with the like the (55:31 - 55:36)
the Mewtwo uh limited time the Meowth (55:33 - 55:38)
limited time the the Lapras battles that (55:36 - 55:40)
I did I don&#39;t know if those limited time (55:38 - 55:43)
events will 100% launch on October 30th (55:40 - 55:45)
they they did show up in the game they (55:43 - 55:47)
did say limited time Lapras was like two (55:45 - 55:49)
weeks the Meowth was two weeks I think (55:47 - 55:52)
the Mewtwo was like a month um none of (55:49 - 55:53)
those are set in stone I just want to be (55:52 - 55:55)
clear like I I maybe when it launches (55:53 - 55:57)
the Lapras will be a month instead of (55:55 - 55:58)
two weeks or maybe the Lapras is the (55:57 - 56:00)
second event and there&#39;s going to be (55:58 - 56:02)
something else in before like launch a (56:00 - 56:03)
game on October 30th and not have like a (56:02 - 56:06)
Gengar set to start it off or something (56:03 - 56:08)
like come on uh but it will it will (56:06 - 56:11)
launch with genetic Apex Pikachu genetic (56:08 - 56:15)
Apex Mewtwo genetic Apex Charizard and (56:11 - 56:16)
that is correct oh okay I was super (56:15 - 56:18)
confused about that I was looking for (56:16 - 56:20)
like another set name somewhere that is (56:18 - 56:23)
not like a like a second and a third set (56:20 - 56:25)
name that is not genetic Apex oh yeah (56:23 - 56:27)
yeah so again can&#39;t talk about cards (56:25 - 56:29)
that have not been released but the the (56:27 - 56:32)
genetic or the the Pikachu immersive (56:29 - 56:36)
Card is only in the Pikachu genetic Apex (56:32 - 56:40)
set got it the Mewtwo Card is only in (56:36 - 56:43)
the Mewtwo set I can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s (56:40 - 56:45)
in the Charizard set because it hasn&#39;t (56:43 - 56:48)
been released but sure you could maybe (56:45 - 56:50)
make a guess of what that&#39;s going to (56:48 - 56:53)
be that uh that&#39;s so interest that (56:50 - 56:55)
almost that almost feels (56:53 - 56:57)
like uh when know when the scarlet and (56:55 - 56:59)
violet sets came out uh you could buy an (56:57 - 57:01)
Elite Trainer Box right that comes with (56:59 - 57:02)
packs you could buy the Scarlet one and (57:01 - 57:03)
the Violet one now the packs inside (57:02 - 57:05)
could have the same cards in them but (57:03 - 57:07)
the thing that was unique is the Scarlet (57:05 - 57:09)
box came with a promo card that was only (57:07 - 57:11)
in The Scarlet box and the Violet box (57:09 - 57:12)
came with a promo card that was only in (57:11 - 57:14)
the Violet box right like you had to buy (57:12 - 57:15)
like both of them if you wanted each of (57:14 - 57:17)
those promo cards it almost feels like (57:15 - 57:19)
that&#39;s like this it&#39;s so the set is (57:17 - 57:20)
genetic Apex but there are three (57:19 - 57:22)
different like Towers to it and each of (57:20 - 57:24)
those is their own collection that you (57:22 - 57:26)
can then collect yeah no I think it&#39;s a (57:24 - 57:30)
great start um there was (57:26 - 57:33)
also they have no plans to bring this to (57:30 - 57:35)
the Nintendo switch that was (57:33 - 57:38)
asked um yeah somebody asked if they (57:35 - 57:39)
were going to bring it to the Apple (57:38 - 57:41)
Vision (57:39 - 57:45)
Pro and they all laughed and they were (57:41 - 57:48)
like it runs normal apps so you could (57:45 - 57:51)
play it on it if you wanted to right um (57:48 - 57:53)
there was no spec it was it was like an (57:51 - 57:56)
apple Vision Pro Plus like iPad question (57:53 - 57:58)
sure well the iPad can play the game (57:56 - 58:00)
anyways but it didn&#39;t sound like they (57:58 - 58:02)
had plans to like optimize it for (58:00 - 58:04)
tablets or optimize it for iPads I was (58:02 - 58:06)
going to say the Mac will be able to (58:04 - 58:07)
play your will be able to mirror your (58:06 - 58:10)
iPhone going like you know next year and (58:07 - 58:12)
then you could play it through that way (58:10 - 58:14)
too so yeah (58:12 - 58:17)
um the game will have similar logins (58:14 - 58:19)
like uh Pokemon sleep or Pokemon go you (58:17 - 58:23)
can log in with Google uh Apple ID (58:19 - 58:25)
or Trainer Club I think it&#39;s either (58:23 - 58:27)
Trainer Club or Nintendo I can&#39;t I can&#39;t (58:25 - 58:29)
remember which one they (58:27 - 58:32)
said uh there are settings that you can (58:29 - 58:34)
change it from 30 frame rate to 60 frame (58:32 - 58:36)
rate you could change it to Performance (58:34 - 58:40)
mode or you can change it to um high (58:36 - 58:43)
quality mode um those settings existed I (58:40 - 58:45)
mean makes sense with like the fact that (58:43 - 58:47)
you&#39;re like showing off cards and it&#39;s (58:45 - 58:48)
got be a smooth that you could have that (58:47 - 58:50)
nice smooth experience with all the (58:48 - 58:51)
different Transitions and animations (58:50 - 58:52)
they&#39;ll have it sounds like there are a (58:51 - 58:54)
lot of very satisfying animations in (58:52 - 58:57)
this game yeah absolutely they they did (58:54 - 58:59)
not okay not Trainer Club Nintendo (58:57 - 59:01)
Google Apple ID so if you do want to (58:59 - 59:03)
move to a different phone your account (59:01 - 59:05)
will be tied to one of those assuming (59:03 - 59:07)
that you linked it (59:05 - 59:09)
properly (59:07 - 59:12)
um their exact answer to ranked battles (59:09 - 59:15)
was quote something we have in the back (59:12 - 59:17)
of our minds for the future we are aware (59:15 - 59:19)
players will want a ranked mode and we (59:17 - 59:20)
will keep that in (59:19 - 59:24)
mind yeah um sounds about (59:20 - 59:27)
right and then another quote that I&#39;ll (59:24 - 59:29)
just say that they directly said was one (59:27 - 59:31)
of the goals was to make the collection (59:29 - 59:34)
aspect fun immersive cards stand out and (59:31 - 59:35)
can&#39;t be done with standard cards the (59:34 - 59:38)
app is something we look forward to the (59:35 - 59:39)
app is something you can look forward to (59:38 - 59:41)
every day even if you&#39;re just opening (59:39 - 59:44)
packs and our core concept was to get (59:41 - 59:47)
more people to play with Pokemon (59:44 - 59:49)
cards and I like how they said like we (59:47 - 59:51)
just want people to play with Pokémon (59:49 - 59:53)
cards it&#39;s not saying like we want (59:51 - 59:54)
people to collect or we want people to (59:53 - 59:57)
battle like we just want people to enjoy (59:54 - 60:00)
these cards in whatever way they want to (59:57 - 60:03)
enjoy them mhm yeah that&#39;s that is very (60:00 - 60:05)
cool they could if they want an idea (60:03 - 60:07)
though they could do like a popup book (60:05 - 60:09)
uh with those immersive cards like (60:07 - 60:10)
physically you could do like you know (60:09 - 60:11)
pop-up books where you like open the (60:10 - 60:13)
book and like a whole scene comes out (60:11 - 60:15)
you could do that with like that&#39;s how (60:13 - 60:16)
you could make him and turn him into (60:15 - 60:18)
like a physical card some point in the (60:16 - 60:21)
future that would be wild that would be (60:18 - 60:23)
absolutely wild but that is very cool (60:21 - 60:25)
that&#39;s um I like that quote too because (60:23 - 60:27)
that does uh I mean that kind of is like (60:25 - 60:29)
with Pokemon cards as well like when (60:27 - 60:31)
you&#39;re a kid like a lot of little kids (60:29 - 60:32)
that get Pokemon cards like they just (60:31 - 60:34)
they like playing with them and looking (60:32 - 60:35)
at them and they don&#39;t they might not (60:34 - 60:38)
play the game or know what trading is or (60:35 - 60:39)
or they want to trade because they like (60:38 - 60:41)
that thing whatever do this to an adult (60:39 - 60:43)
I do this to I do this I like that&#39;s why (60:41 - 60:45)
I said the binder thing was really cool (60:43 - 60:47)
because like I will take out a binder (60:45 - 60:49)
and I will open that binder and just (60:47 - 60:50)
look through pages of cards because it&#39;s (60:49 - 60:53)
just artwork and it&#39;s beautiful yeah and (60:50 - 60:54)
I mean I know I&#39;ve said multiple times (60:53 - 60:56)
on this show that sometimes when I am (60:54 - 60:58)
just sad or having a bad day I will (60:56 - 61:00)
reach over and grab one of my extra (60:58 - 61:03)
Pokemon card packs especially from the (61:00 - 61:05)
Halloween bundles because there are just (61:03 - 61:07)
too many there um and I&#39;ll just open a (61:05 - 61:10)
pack for fun to give me joy and this (61:07 - 61:13)
game sounds like kind of exactly that (61:10 - 61:15)
yep exactly exactly except not as much (61:13 - 61:18)
mess and not as much (61:15 - 61:20)
cardboard uh I&#39;m just looking through (61:18 - 61:21)
the notes to make sure I didn&#39;t miss (61:20 - 61:23)
anything there is a premium pass uh it&#39;s (61:21 - 61:24)
a monthly subscription it is a (61:23 - 61:26)
subscription it will renew like Pokemon (61:24 - 61:28)
sleep or Pokemon (61:26 - 61:31)
unite insert my complaint about Niantic (61:28 - 61:33)
here uh the monthly subscription will be (61:31 - 61:36)
$10 a month you will get one additional (61:33 - 61:38)
booster pack so a total of three booster (61:36 - 61:41)
packs every 24 hours I don&#39;t exactly (61:38 - 61:44)
know how that works with the clock time (61:41 - 61:48)
yeah countdown but um uh you can try it (61:44 - 61:50)
for two weeks for free when it launches (61:48 - 61:52)
uh it will give you extra premium (61:50 - 61:55)
missions and those missions will offer a (61:52 - 61:58)
player a chance to obtain a unique promo (61:55 - 61:59)
card so that would be kind of like your (61:58 - 62:02)
Elite Trainer boxes and additional (61:59 - 62:05)
ingame items such as playmats card (62:02 - 62:08)
sleeves coins currently promo a cards (62:05 - 62:11)
acquired via the premium pass feature (62:08 - 62:13)
the same attacks and abilities of cards (62:11 - 62:16)
that can be obtained at no cost during (62:13 - 62:19)
normal gameplay uh they are just (62:16 - 62:22)
highlighting an alternative illustration (62:19 - 62:25)
yep that&#39;s so again not pay to win I say (62:22 - 62:27)
not pay to win (62:25 - 62:29)
but it&#39;s a trading card game at the end (62:27 - 62:31)
of the day yeah sure and like if you&#39;re (62:29 - 62:33)
playing Magic if you&#39;re playing Yu-Gi-Oh (62:31 - 62:36)
if you&#39;re playing (62:33 - 62:36)
Pokemon you have to collect cards and (62:37 - 62:41)
then use those cards (62:39 - 62:43)
like yeah and I mean think about this (62:41 - 62:46)
like if that promo card is a good card (62:43 - 62:48)
you&#39;re getting it for the price of the (62:46 - 62:50)
subscription versus like the chance of (62:48 - 62:52)
opening it for free right cuz that&#39;s (62:50 - 62:54)
very much like the regular trading card (62:52 - 62:56)
game like the cards at different artwork (62:54 - 62:58)
but they all have the same moves on them (62:56 - 63:00)
yeah so you can buy the cheaper version (62:58 - 63:02)
of the card if you&#39;re using it to play (63:00 - 63:03)
or if you&#39;re collecting you might get (63:02 - 63:05)
the alternate art version they have the (63:03 - 63:08)
same moves on them so uh but in this (63:05 - 63:10)
case that you know you the promo card if (63:08 - 63:12)
it&#39;s a good card you&#39;re getting it for (63:10 - 63:14)
the subscription price versus like (63:12 - 63:17)
having to try to pull it right so yeah (63:14 - 63:18)
and you could trade like if you don&#39;t (63:17 - 63:19)
want to spend any money if you&#39;re (63:18 - 63:21)
missing one card for your deck you can (63:19 - 63:24)
trade for it eventually eventually (63:21 - 63:27)
however that works out look I beat the (63:24 - 63:30)
hardest whatever with with no good cards (63:27 - 63:31)
like whatever the cards I pulled I beat (63:30 - 63:35)
the hardest whatever uh so maybe because (63:31 - 63:37)
I know but let&#39;s say you don&#39;t like (63:35 - 63:39)
battling and you have some missions that (63:37 - 63:41)
require you to battle we haven&#39;t talked (63:39 - 63:44)
about this there&#39;s Auto battling in this (63:41 - 63:47)
game oh so you can build a deck and you (63:44 - 63:50)
can hit the little Auto Battle and the (63:47 - 63:52)
CPU will play for you you will watch it (63:50 - 63:54)
happen now there is no like speed up (63:52 - 63:56)
mode maybe hopefully they&#39;ll add that in (63:54 - 63:58)
a future um but the games are relatively (63:56 - 64:01)
quick anyways um I did it multiple ways (63:58 - 64:03)
I did it where I did the full battle (64:01 - 64:05)
myself I went in I did half the battle (64:03 - 64:07)
and then hit autoplay and then I started (64:05 - 64:11)
the battle just hit autoplay the (64:07 - 64:14)
computer made all the choices I would (64:11 - 64:16)
have made like the computer was (64:14 - 64:18)
incredibly smart like I was like I I (64:16 - 64:20)
would I would the only the only time the (64:18 - 64:21)
computer didn&#39;t do something where I was (64:20 - 64:23)
like huh I would have just like got (64:21 - 64:25)
knocked out and like prepped my bench (64:23 - 64:27)
the computer opted to like retreat (64:25 - 64:29)
something and promote something mhm and (64:27 - 64:31)
I was like uh yeah I guess that&#39;s fine (64:29 - 64:33)
like you still win it&#39;s just like I (64:31 - 64:35)
would have just like just take me out (64:33 - 64:37)
just take the point I&#39;m I&#39;m prepping (64:35 - 64:40)
back here um but it was like the right (64:37 - 64:41)
call I guess like it wasn&#39;t like the (64:40 - 64:42)
wrong way to play it was just a (64:41 - 64:45)
different way to play uh so you can (64:42 - 64:47)
completely Auto Battle uh I think that&#39;s (64:45 - 64:49)
something Marvel snap does not have (64:47 - 64:50)
unless you have like a I think there&#39;s (64:49 - 64:52)
like a specific card in Marvel snap that (64:50 - 64:54)
will like Auto Battle for you yeah there (64:52 - 64:56)
are some cards that that do multiple (64:54 - 64:59)
turns of things but it is not a game (64:56 - 65:01)
where you can Auto Battle not like (64:59 - 65:04)
Pokemon Masters or anything like that (65:01 - 65:06)
this is probably a no but I&#39;m just going (65:04 - 65:08)
to ask it it doesn&#39;t learn your play (65:06 - 65:10)
style as you play more and then when you (65:08 - 65:11)
Auto Battle later it would like do it (65:10 - 65:13)
more question you should have came to (65:11 - 65:17)
this Bobby you had good questions um no (65:13 - 65:20)
I I I did not think to ask that question (65:17 - 65:21)
I was just really impressed with how the (65:20 - 65:24)
auto battle did its thing to be fair I (65:21 - 65:26)
think the auto battle in Masters makes (65:24 - 65:29)
the right place too um I don&#39;t know if (65:26 - 65:30)
the Auto Battle would have beat Lapras (65:29 - 65:33)
on the hardest mode uh but I was on like (65:30 - 65:35)
the the second hardest mode and it it (65:33 - 65:38)
made the the right plays um yeah so (65:35 - 65:39)
that&#39;s cool uh that&#39;s cool going back to (65:38 - 65:41)
the premium pass I think we&#39;re almost (65:39 - 65:45)
done here um if you are to spend any (65:41 - 65:49)
money in this game $10 gets you sorry (65:45 - 65:52)
$12 gets you 10 packs that&#39;s the math I (65:49 - 65:55)
did mhm that&#39;s how it shakes out if (65:52 - 65:58)
you&#39;re going to give it at $10 or $112 I (65:55 - 66:00)
guess uh premium pass is ultimately (65:58 - 66:04)
going to give you 30 packs extra a month (66:00 - 66:07)
assuming there&#39;s 30 days in a month so (66:04 - 66:11)
um but that requires you to log in every (66:07 - 66:14)
day I do think like I said earlier where (66:11 - 66:16)
if you don&#39;t have a premium pass it will (66:14 - 66:18)
hold two packs and then the timer (66:16 - 66:20)
completely stops uh this will hold three (66:18 - 66:22)
packs before the timer completely stops (66:20 - 66:24)
so you do have a little bit more leeway (66:22 - 66:29)
in not needing to sign in as often do I (66:24 - 66:31)
think you said this earlier but does it (66:29 - 66:32)
change so like if you&#39;re getting three (66:31 - 66:35)
packs instead of two does that mean your (66:32 - 66:37)
timer is 8 hours or is your timer still (66:35 - 66:41)
12 I don&#39;t know because I like signed up (66:37 - 66:46)
for it right but like it didn&#39;t I don&#39;t (66:41 - 66:48)
know if it was like yeah like it didn&#39;t (66:46 - 66:50)
work because it was like it the the the (66:48 - 66:51)
game I was playing didn&#39;t care about (66:50 - 66:56)
money yeah okay got it um (66:51 - 66:57)
but you do get bonus missions and (66:56 - 67:01)
everything um there are rental decks (66:57 - 67:02)
there are custom (67:01 - 67:05)
decks um it it&#39;s a totally new game so (67:02 - 67:08)
if you&#39;re like does this integrate with (67:05 - 67:10)
my current card collection physically no (67:08 - 67:12)
does this integrate with ptcgo no does (67:10 - 67:14)
this integrate with ptcg live no it&#39;s (67:12 - 67:17)
it&#39;s it&#39;s its own thing um it&#39;s on its (67:14 - 67:18)
own (67:17 - 67:20)
schedule I mean somebody mentioned like (67:18 - 67:22)
do you plan on doing like a Pokémon go (67:20 - 67:23)
promotion like the other game and they (67:22 - 67:25)
were like yeah we thought about it like (67:23 - 67:27)
there there&#39;s like a lot of potential (67:25 - 67:28)
here and like questions you would be (67:27 - 67:29)
asking would (67:28 - 67:32)
be (67:29 - 67:35)
like I think right now it very much came (67:32 - 67:37)
across of we just want to get this out (67:35 - 67:38)
here we just want to see how people feel (67:37 - 67:41)
about it we think we know the direction (67:38 - 67:43)
to take this in which is like ranked (67:41 - 67:46)
mode more collecting more exclusive (67:43 - 67:49)
stuff but you don&#39;t make those you don&#39;t (67:46 - 67:51)
make those decisions until you actually (67:49 - 67:54)
see how people yeah react absolutely (67:51 - 67:57)
that makes sense um and just to say it (67:54 - 67:59)
again one more time because just to (67:57 - 68:02)
confirm this the code cards we have for (67:59 - 68:06)
physical packs will not work with this (68:02 - 68:10)
game will not work okay uh okay I will I (68:06 - 68:12)
have one more thing to end on this is my (68:10 - 68:14)
only complaint of the game and I did ask (68:12 - 68:17)
them this uh (68:14 - 68:20)
so when the TCG first released there (68:17 - 68:22)
were item cards that people know like (68:20 - 68:25)
Bill draw two cards switch switch one (68:22 - 68:26)
Pokemon with your active with your bench (68:25 - 68:29)
Pokemon these cards exist to this day (68:26 - 68:31)
like you could play a switch card from (68:29 - 68:35)
1998 as long as the text matches and the (68:31 - 68:38)
title matches and the back of the card (68:35 - 68:40)
matches you can play people play like (68:38 - 68:43)
energy from fossil set right (68:40 - 68:47)
like um and so these cards have always (68:43 - 68:48)
done the same thing now there are some (68:47 - 68:50)
cards that have changed over time like (68:48 - 68:52)
uh Pokemon catcher used to be just you (68:50 - 68:54)
play it after after black and white (68:52 - 68:56)
ended they changed it to to flip a coin (68:54 - 68:57)
so like you can&#39;t use those cards (68:56 - 68:59)
anymore CU they did update the (68:57 - 69:02)
rule uh but back in 1998 there was a (68:59 - 69:04)
card called Pokeball and Pokeball was (69:02 - 69:06)
flip a coin if heads search in your deck (69:04 - 69:09)
for a Pokemon and put it into your hand (69:06 - 69:13)
they changed Pokeball in Pocket to where (69:09 - 69:16)
it&#39;s just it will randomly search your (69:13 - 69:19)
deck for a card and put it into your (69:16 - 69:20)
hand there is no coin (69:19 - 69:24)
flip so my question (69:20 - 69:27)
was and okay another card just before I (69:24 - 69:29)
get to my question was Professor Oaks (69:27 - 69:33)
research now in the TCG that&#39;s shuffle (69:29 - 69:34)
your hand into your deck or or maybe it (69:33 - 69:36)
was discard I can&#39;t remember or like (69:34 - 69:38)
discard your hand and then draw six (69:36 - 69:40)
cards draw seven cards in this it was (69:38 - 69:43)
just draw two cards which is ultimately (69:40 - 69:45)
what Bill does just draw two cards and (69:43 - 69:47)
so my question to them was you have all (69:45 - 69:50)
these iconic cards that have stayed with (69:47 - 69:53)
rules for 28 (69:50 - 69:56)
years with the exception of some card (69:53 - 69:57)
update and change the (69:56 - 70:01)
rules why did you not make new cards why (69:57 - 70:06)
did you change current iconic cards to (70:01 - 70:08)
thish (70:06 - 70:13)
and their response was we knew that (70:08 - 70:15)
hardcore fans would know these cards (70:13 - 70:17)
really well and understand that the (70:15 - 70:19)
rules of these cards will change but our (70:17 - 70:21)
goal was (70:19 - 70:26)
to simplify the game enough for anyone (70:21 - 70:29)
to enjoy it but also to make the game go (70:26 - 70:35)
quicker yep and teach you the basics and (70:29 - 70:37)
you might know that this Professor Oak (70:35 - 70:39)
will let you draw two cards but if you (70:37 - 70:41)
do decide to move over to ptcg live or (70:39 - 70:44)
play in person you&#39;ll just know that oh (70:41 - 70:47)
I can draw more cards because this is a (70:44 - 70:50)
bigger game yep and pocket is a smaller (70:47 - 70:52)
game so they&#39;re say so they said any (70:50 - 70:55)
card that we revised we still kept the (70:52 - 70:59)
core concept of that card MH so that&#39;s (70:55 - 71:00)
why I said it&#39;s like kind of a complaint (70:59 - 71:02)
because it&#39;s (71:00 - 71:05)
like yeah so I was going to say when you (71:02 - 71:07)
first s to the first one where instead (71:05 - 71:09)
of um searching your deck for something (71:07 - 71:11)
it just randomly gives you one I was (71:09 - 71:13)
wondering are there going to be any (71:11 - 71:15)
cards that allow you to search your deck (71:13 - 71:16)
because that would take time so they&#39;re (71:15 - 71:19)
taking that aspect out of it and then (71:16 - 71:21)
just giving you something randomly so (71:19 - 71:23)
you&#39;re not actually able to look through (71:21 - 71:25)
your deck take the time to see what you (71:23 - 71:26)
want to (71:25 - 71:28)
yeah I think I think you&#39;re 100% right (71:26 - 71:30)
every trainer card I had which there was (71:28 - 71:31)
only maybe six or seven that I saw in (71:30 - 71:33)
the game um and and some of them were (71:31 - 71:36)
specific like Koga was like uh searching (71:33 - 71:38)
your deck for a muuk and add it to your (71:36 - 71:40)
hand it was like gri or a Muk I think (71:38 - 71:42)
was Koga specific (71:40 - 71:45)
supporter um I didn&#39;t have any muck or k (71:42 - 71:46)
or or or grimer so I couldn&#39;t even like (71:45 - 71:49)
put that card in my deck but it it just (71:46 - 71:51)
like Pokeball was random Pokemon from (71:49 - 71:54)
your deck um all the cards seem to (71:51 - 71:57)
search out a specific Pokemon or a (71:54 - 72:00)
random Pokemon per the rule or just draw (71:57 - 72:03)
cards like it does not seem like you&#39;re (72:00 - 72:05)
going to be searching your 20 card deck (72:03 - 72:07)
specifically for you want it does seem (72:05 - 72:09)
very there&#39;s that that&#39;s the RNG that&#39;s (72:07 - 72:13)
the like um but it&#39;s a different game (72:09 - 72:15)
smaller shorter uh again it it did (72:13 - 72:18)
really remind me of like Clash Royale (72:15 - 72:20)
where like you could sit down on the bus (72:18 - 72:23)
in the waiting room in the car as (72:20 - 72:25)
somebody runs in to grab like a soda (72:23 - 72:26)
from the gas station and you could (72:25 - 72:29)
complete a full game uh and feel really (72:26 - 72:32)
good about it without like look if you (72:29 - 72:34)
played ptcg live or you play TCG in (72:32 - 72:37)
person that&#39;s like a that that can be a (72:34 - 72:41)
20 to 40 minute game yep that is and I (72:37 - 72:42)
don&#39;t think any of these games could (72:41 - 72:45)
possibly last 20 I don&#39;t think they (72:42 - 72:46)
could get to 20 minutes if you tried (72:45 - 72:48)
that&#39;s really cool because that is (72:46 - 72:52)
sometimes my complaint with um TCG live (72:48 - 72:54)
or back when it was online it&#39;s like I (72:52 - 72:57)
would sit down and think oh I want to (72:54 - 72:59)
start a game and then I would think well (72:57 - 73:00)
I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t know that I have 30 (72:59 - 73:02)
minutes right now to play this game like (73:00 - 73:03)
yeah I just want to sit down and like (73:02 - 73:08)
play cards but not for 45 minutes and I (73:03 - 73:10)
mean games like Pokemon unite are kind (73:08 - 73:12)
of that way too unite is just a little (73:10 - 73:15)
bit longer just a little bit too long to (73:12 - 73:16)
kind of sit in the car while someone (73:15 - 73:18)
goes in and grabs something from a store (73:16 - 73:20)
and then you will still be playing the (73:18 - 73:22)
game and with Pokemon go you kind of (73:20 - 73:26)
have to be able to go somewhere unless (73:22 - 73:27)
you just want to catch the one or two (73:26 - 73:29)
Pokemon that are wherever you are this (73:27 - 73:33)
sounds kind of like a good relaxing (73:29 - 73:35)
sitting in one place for a few minutes (73:33 - 73:38)
kind of game y definitely and to your to (73:35 - 73:40)
your point about the answer they gave (73:38 - 73:42)
you with the uh making the game a little (73:40 - 73:44)
more simple and quicker I love that (73:42 - 73:45)
they&#39;re keeping the core concept of some (73:44 - 73:47)
of those classic cards in there because (73:45 - 73:49)
they could have just completely revised (73:47 - 73:50)
these things 100% right it&#39;s a (73:49 - 73:52)
completely different game but the fact (73:50 - 73:54)
that they&#39;re taking those those classic (73:52 - 73:56)
cards keeping the core con cep in there (73:54 - 74:00)
is uh really cool as well yeah so um no (73:56 - 74:02)
I&#39;m so excited about it like I it was (74:00 - 74:04)
really hard to find anything wrong like (74:02 - 74:06)
I I thought the pricing was going to be (74:04 - 74:09)
too expensive I thought the um I thought (74:06 - 74:10)
the game was going to be very money (74:09 - 74:12)
grabby I thought the the sets were going (74:10 - 74:17)
to be smaller or harder to collect (74:12 - 74:21)
or like trading would be local only (74:17 - 74:22)
although we don&#39;t know a lot about (74:21 - 74:24)
trading (74:22 - 74:27)
um or the battle system would be (74:24 - 74:30)
like not interesting or like not worth (74:27 - 74:32)
it but like everything about it seems (74:30 - 74:34)
like they just knocked it out of the (74:32 - 74:37)
park um and again the stuff that&#39;s (74:34 - 74:40)
missing uh like the trading or like a (74:37 - 74:42)
ranked mode in battle completely makes (74:40 - 74:44)
sense because like you just need to get (74:42 - 74:46)
it into people&#39;s hands so they can start (74:44 - 74:48)
growing a collection so they can start (74:46 - 74:50)
playing so they don&#39;t feel like they (74:48 - 74:53)
need to spend money to catch up um (74:50 - 74:57)
obviously you can spend money but um (74:53 - 74:59)
I I think two two packs a day or even if (74:57 - 75:00)
you do the three packs a day I think (74:59 - 75:02)
it&#39;s I think it&#39;s perfect I think it (75:00 - 75:04)
just gives you time to log in open packs (75:02 - 75:06)
be like dang that was cool or like oh I (75:04 - 75:07)
didn&#39;t get anything good that&#39;s okay (75:06 - 75:09)
I&#39;ll come back later today I&#39;ll do it (75:07 - 75:13)
again like it just seems (75:09 - 75:17)
like how could you be upset like kind of (75:13 - 75:19)
thing like it just it just it just like (75:17 - 75:21)
it really feels like a joyful game of (75:19 - 75:23)
like yeah I can just it like it&#39;s not (75:21 - 75:26)
asking a lot of time it&#39;s giving me (75:23 - 75:28)
stuff if I want to put money into it I (75:26 - 75:31)
feel like there&#39;s value there a120 a (75:28 - 75:35)
pack vers $5 a pack um if you just like (75:31 - 75:37)
people like collecting I think a lot of (75:35 - 75:38)
people listening to this podcast like (75:37 - 75:40)
Pokemon because you collect things I I (75:38 - 75:41)
don&#39;t know if you know that about (75:40 - 75:44)
Pokemon it&#39;s a collection based game uh (75:41 - 75:46)
so I and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve always wanted (75:44 - 75:48)
from the TCG personally like obviously I (75:46 - 75:49)
played competitively for years I&#39;ve (75:48 - 75:52)
enjoyed competitive I don&#39;t have the (75:49 - 75:57)
time to do five 40 minute matches a (75:52 - 75:58)
night to practice to go to tournaments (75:57 - 76:00)
but I that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t miss (75:58 - 76:03)
playing the TCG and this (76:00 - 76:07)
mode just like scratched that itch like (76:03 - 76:09)
this is I just short games it still (76:07 - 76:11)
feels like the TCG it&#39;s like quicker (76:09 - 76:14)
paced yeah I&#39;m so excited for it I&#39;m (76:11 - 76:16)
like like I didn&#39;t think anything could (76:14 - 76:19)
beat my excitement for Pokemon sleep but (76:16 - 76:21)
this game holy cow I&#39;m just so excited (76:19 - 76:26)
for it to launch I hope it catches on (76:21 - 76:29)
I think it&#39;ll be huge I sure hope so (76:26 - 76:30)
this sounds like it&#39;s gonna be a really (76:29 - 76:33)
good game I think two packs a day and (76:30 - 76:35)
just the missions and I I think it&#39;s (76:33 - 76:37)
going to be huge I think it&#39;s absolutely (76:35 - 76:39)
going to crush it yep I think there a (76:37 - 76:42)
lot of um one thing that you know (76:39 - 76:45)
playing the game uh the TCG uh doesn&#39;t (76:42 - 76:47)
get a lot of the collectors involved (76:45 - 76:48)
there are absolutely people who collect (76:47 - 76:50)
and also play the game but there is a (76:48 - 76:52)
huge number of people who are collectors (76:50 - 76:56)
who do not play the game uh because it (76:52 - 76:57)
you know it&#39;s time it takes a lot of (76:56 - 76:59)
time it does and it&#39;s it&#39;s fun but it (76:57 - 77:03)
takes a lot of time and it is um it is (76:59 - 77:06)
definitely the uh barrier to entry like (77:03 - 77:07)
there there&#39;s just there&#39;s a lot going (77:06 - 77:09)
on with it it is expensive to play the (77:07 - 77:11)
game when you play the physical game uh (77:09 - 77:14)
it&#39;s very expensive um and you know (77:11 - 77:15)
getting into it can be a lot but there (77:14 - 77:18)
are a lot of collectors who like the (77:15 - 77:21)
idea of it that I&#39;ve talked to and so (77:18 - 77:23)
when they when they heard about pocket (77:21 - 77:26)
there&#39;s a lot of excitement in the a (77:23 - 77:29)
collector based um audience that is (77:26 - 77:30)
excited for this game for the things (77:29 - 77:33)
that it offers so I think it is uh going (77:30 - 77:35)
to be I think it&#39;s also going to be (77:33 - 77:37)
pretty popular and I&#39;m excited to see (77:35 - 77:40)
you know what they do with it yeah sorry (77:37 - 77:42)
one more thing uh the game does a really (77:40 - 77:44)
good job at teaching you how to play it (77:42 - 77:46)
does have like a tutorial thing uh I I (77:44 - 77:48)
know this question is asked me all the (77:46 - 77:49)
time like Steve I want to get in the (77:48 - 77:50)
Pokemon Trading Card Game how do I learn (77:49 - 77:53)
the rules and I would say like ptcgo and (77:50 - 77:57)
PTC ptcg Live live both those games were (77:53 - 78:00)
really good at teaching you how to play (77:57 - 78:01)
and you can&#39;t really mess up because the (78:00 - 78:03)
computer is like you can&#39;t do this (78:01 - 78:05)
you&#39;re not you need to participate in (78:03 - 78:07)
the rules (78:05 - 78:10)
um pocket forces you to go through the (78:07 - 78:12)
tutorial which is was a little annoying (78:10 - 78:13)
for me because it&#39;s like I know how to (78:12 - 78:15)
play like except you don&#39;t know because (78:13 - 78:18)
this is a new game that&#39;s true but (78:15 - 78:19)
everything they were showing was like (78:18 - 78:20)
Yep this makes sense yep I&#39;ll get my (78:19 - 78:22)
energy here yes I&#39;ll do that you have to (78:20 - 78:24)
go through it it took like maybe 10 (78:22 - 78:26)
minutes to go through the I think it&#39;s (78:24 - 78:28)
eighth step tutorial to go through and (78:26 - 78:29)
then once you go through there&#39;s an (78:28 - 78:31)
advanced tutorial and at that point you (78:29 - 78:34)
can just skip that and go right into (78:31 - 78:37)
battling uh which is what I did uh but (78:34 - 78:39)
of course you did I did I I didn&#39;t do (78:37 - 78:40)
the advance but you have to do I think (78:39 - 78:41)
it&#39;s like eight step for regular so it (78:40 - 78:44)
does teach you and I think this does (78:41 - 78:47)
accomplish that of like maybe you never (78:44 - 78:50)
played the 60 card deck but you really (78:47 - 78:53)
really like this it might push you to (78:50 - 78:56)
then be like now I understand how to (78:53 - 78:58)
play this game I want to play the bigger (78:56 - 79:02)
version of this game now y um kind of (78:58 - 79:04)
like there are a lot of board games (79:02 - 79:05)
where like there&#39;s a big version of the (79:04 - 79:07)
board game and then they make like a (79:05 - 79:10)
mini two-player mode of that board game (79:07 - 79:12)
and they&#39;re like oh cool I can play like (79:10 - 79:14)
mini version of settlers of Katan with (79:12 - 79:16)
my like significant other but if I want (79:14 - 79:17)
to play like the big version with four (79:16 - 79:19)
people like I know the rules because I (79:17 - 79:21)
played the little version (79:19 - 79:25)
yeah um so anyways uh if you have more (79:21 - 79:27)
more questions about pocket uh you can (79:25 - 79:29)
leave them in the YouTube comments below (79:27 - 79:31)
uh I have a bunch of notes I think we (79:29 - 79:33)
covered everything but also Bobby asked (79:31 - 79:35)
questions I didn&#39;t think to ask the the (79:33 - 79:39)
people um and I&#39;m sure you have (79:35 - 79:41)
questions the number one question I got (79:39 - 79:43)
was will the code cards work once again (79:41 - 79:47)
no the code cards will not (79:43 - 79:51)
work uh but anyways uh if you&#39;re (79:47 - 79:53)
listening to this it means I&#39;m probably (79:51 - 79:56)
