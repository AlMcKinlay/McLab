what's up everyone welcome to the 560 (0:23 - 0:29)
second episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:27 - 0:31)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:29 - 0:34)
with me is Hannah (0:31 - 0:37)
I am very very tired I finally brought (0:34 - 0:39)
my cat to my new apartment she had been (0:37 - 0:41)
staying with my family while I kind of (0:39 - 0:43)
got it set up and she doesn't like it (0:41 - 0:44)
hear it (0:43 - 0:49)
yeah just the key word yeah yeah I yeah (0:44 - 0:52)
I'm I'm investing a lot and not yet I am (0:49 - 0:55)
worried about her but she's here (0:52 - 0:58)
they're pets they get used to it because (0:55 - 1:01)
they have no choice she's just stressed (0:58 - 1:05)
yep I'm not even a cat (1:01 - 1:11)
same yup Greg also here I am also here (1:05 - 1:11)
that's it (1:11 - 1:15)
like you get mad if I say like it's cold (1:12 - 1:16)
outside she's like let's not talk about (1:15 - 1:18)
the weather what do you want me to talk (1:16 - 1:20)
about my brunch I went to brunch today (1:18 - 1:23)
yo what's your order from brunch uh I (1:20 - 1:26)
had the classic which was eggs bacon and (1:23 - 1:29)
breakfast potatoes (1:26 - 1:33)
um the delicious breakfast potato why am (1:29 - 1:35)
I never invited a brunch (1:33 - 1:38)
because you don't get up before noon (1:35 - 1:40)
yeah my guess is you're asleep (1:38 - 1:43)
and here's the thing we got a brunch (1:40 - 1:46)
every Sunday by brunch it's my husband (1:43 - 1:48)
and I and we go eat before we go grocery (1:46 - 1:49)
shopping so we're not starving when (1:48 - 1:52)
we're grocery shopping it's awesome to (1:49 - 1:55)
lessen the impact of how much money (1:52 - 1:57)
we're about to spend on groceries yeah (1:55 - 1:59)
don't want to go grocery shopping hungry (1:57 - 2:01)
I do that all the time it's always a (1:59 - 2:03)
mistake yep (2:01 - 2:04)
that's good it's already bad enough (2:03 - 2:06)
because everything looks good like we (2:04 - 2:09)
bought for no good reason (2:06 - 2:13)
a half of a pie (2:09 - 2:15)
and the reason why I bought it is it's a (2:13 - 2:17)
raspberry lemonade pie (2:15 - 2:20)
interesting what is that we don't know (2:17 - 2:24)
we're gonna find out (2:20 - 2:24)
all right speaking of finding out uh we (2:24 - 2:28)
have some we have a lot of TCG news this (2:26 - 2:31)
week but not the TCG news you think we (2:28 - 2:34)
have dcg news the panic-inducing TCC is (2:31 - 2:36)
because Japan (2:34 - 2:39)
is it Dire Straits the worst possible (2:36 - 2:42)
outcome has happened (2:39 - 2:45)
um so we have some TCG news we have uh (2:42 - 2:47)
the global Challenge three is apparently (2:45 - 2:49)
already announced and coming even though (2:47 - 2:51)
as a recording Global challenge two is (2:49 - 2:54)
still up and going (2:51 - 2:55)
um (2:54 - 2:58)
and uh some other little things here and (2:55 - 2:59)
there but I think the TCG stuff is going (2:58 - 3:00)
to take (2:59 - 3:02)
the majority of the first part of this (3:00 - 3:04)
episode so uh let's start with news (3:02 - 3:06)
article number one which is off Kotaku (3:04 - 3:08)
which (3:06 - 3:11)
that's still a website uh Japan if I (3:08 - 3:13)
wouldn't not be a website (3:11 - 3:16)
they there's a lot of like not great (3:13 - 3:19)
writers at Kotaku well yeah there's also (3:16 - 3:21)
some good (3:19 - 3:24)
onesbook.com so let's not get to yeah no (3:21 - 3:26)
the common people at comicbook.com are (3:24 - 3:27)
very nice at least the people I talk to (3:26 - 3:29)
at comicbook.com but you're right (3:27 - 3:33)
comicbook.com is huge there's a lot of (3:29 - 3:36)
uh other articles that pop up you take (3:33 - 3:37)
the good you take the bad you take it (3:36 - 3:38)
yes (3:37 - 3:42)
she was uh one of the writers this is (3:38 - 3:45)
like a year ago it was like spoiling (3:42 - 3:46)
Pokemon and then people were trying to (3:45 - 3:48)
argue that they were spoiling Pokemon (3:46 - 3:51)
and they were like no because I don't (3:48 - 3:53)
know what the reason was (3:51 - 3:56)
that was a very good reason (3:53 - 3:58)
um anyways (3:56 - 4:01)
Japan has uh the title of this is uh is (3:58 - 4:03)
from Levy Japan has completely run out (4:01 - 4:05)
of Pokemon cards see I told you it (4:03 - 4:07)
wasn't the news you expected (4:05 - 4:10)
this is actually crazy news (4:07 - 4:12)
I think (4:10 - 4:15)
okay now remember Japan is ahead in (4:12 - 4:17)
cards than America the Pokemon company (4:15 - 4:20)
dropped to a new expansion for the (4:17 - 4:22)
trading card game on April 14th that is (4:20 - 4:24)
around scarlet and Violet's four (4:22 - 4:26)
treasures of ruined (4:24 - 4:28)
um so they do two sets at a time (4:26 - 4:31)
normally so one is called clay burst and (4:28 - 4:34)
the other is called snow hazard (4:31 - 4:36)
um and this uh (4:34 - 4:40)
is the expansion to uh triple beat which (4:36 - 4:42)
I believe in America is going to be (4:40 - 4:45)
called paldea evolved (4:42 - 4:49)
anyways name's not important (4:45 - 4:49)
for the sake of the article I guess (4:49 - 4:54)
um clayberson snow Hazard are just (4:51 - 4:55)
distinctively different because of the (4:54 - 4:57)
cards available in each pack for example (4:55 - 5:00)
there's a pokey influencer iono that can (4:57 - 5:03)
only be acquired in clay burst and that (5:00 - 5:05)
has that fact alone has collectors going (5:03 - 5:09)
wild in Japan because uh she has a (5:05 - 5:11)
special illustration rare card and (5:09 - 5:15)
according to a YouTuber ptcg radio they (5:11 - 5:17)
also do a podcast (5:15 - 5:18)
um (5:17 - 5:20)
that is the most expensive card we've (5:18 - 5:21)
seen to date (5:20 - 5:24)
in I I don't think the full code is here (5:21 - 5:27)
but I think in like a new set obviously (5:24 - 5:31)
there might be like an illustration PSA (5:27 - 5:31)
uh these two sets have been the most uh (5:34 - 5:39)
hyped we've seen uh according to a (5:37 - 5:42)
player Ethan who tweeted on April 13th (5:39 - 5:45)
the line for the set release in (5:42 - 5:49)
Akihabara uh was quote insane (5:45 - 5:52)
uh there's no picture here (5:49 - 5:54)
just assuming (5:52 - 5:58)
base off of that (5:54 - 6:02)
long lines I have a question about what (5:58 - 6:05)
what qualifies to this person what scale (6:02 - 6:07)
are you using because I've been doing (6:05 - 6:09)
when did the lines start forming how (6:07 - 6:11)
long was it how many blocks did it take (6:09 - 6:16)
I waited three hours for a ride so (6:11 - 6:16)
for red (6:17 - 6:22)
three hours is it worth the ride yeah oh (6:19 - 6:24)
yeah absolutely worth it well they kind (6:22 - 6:27)
of lie to us because that was 85 minutes (6:24 - 6:29)
and then once we were well on the line (6:27 - 6:30)
they're like oop it's three hours and (6:29 - 6:32)
we're like well do they do it in minutes (6:30 - 6:35)
because that seems less confusing than (6:32 - 6:38)
ours I wouldn't say less confusing it (6:35 - 6:40)
probably seems shorter (6:38 - 6:43)
I don't know 85 minutes is you're still (6:40 - 6:46)
like that's an hour and a half versus (6:43 - 6:52)
360 minutes which you're like yeah (6:46 - 6:52)
there might be some sort of cut off like (6:52 - 6:56)
if it's less than 100 minutes you use (6:54 - 6:59)
minutes so that people don't want do the (6:56 - 7:00)
conversion in their heads but they know (6:59 - 7:04)
it's not that much yeah yeah (7:00 - 7:04)
uh initial quotes for cases of clavers (7:06 - 7:13)
and snow Hazard are going for 306 3 600 (7:09 - 7:16)
with the iono card particularly running (7:13 - 7:17)
at uh (7:16 - 7:22)
1255 dollars uh which when it came out (7:17 - 7:24)
two weeks ago it was at two thousand (7:22 - 7:27)
dollars in Japan (7:24 - 7:27)
now on top of all of this (7:28 - 7:33)
the Pokemon company took to the official (7:31 - 7:35)
trading card Japanese website to drop (7:33 - 7:36)
some unfortunate news about the (7:35 - 7:39)
situation admitting (7:36 - 7:41)
that it's currently out of stock of (7:39 - 7:45)
Pokemon cards at the moment (7:41 - 7:47)
what I'm hearing is that iono is a (7:45 - 7:49)
pretty pretty spectacular Pokey (7:47 - 7:51)
influencer yeah (7:49 - 7:56)
apparently not even Marnie could do this (7:51 - 7:58)
um (7:56 - 7:58)
not great fans (8:02 - 8:07)
see this is this is where Kotaku could (8:05 - 8:09)
level up this is no shade to the author (8:07 - 8:10)
by the way but like (8:09 - 8:12)
they they have written here blog post (8:10 - 8:15)
which is translated by Google Now if (8:12 - 8:17)
kataku wanted to level up they get (8:15 - 8:19)
somebody who speaks Japanese and they (8:17 - 8:21)
get an official you can't trust Google I (8:19 - 8:23)
mean we're bad we're bad journalists (8:21 - 8:25)
here too because we're just reading (8:23 - 8:29)
we are not journalists there is nothing (8:25 - 8:33)
that we do that qualifies any of this as (8:29 - 8:34)
journalism (8:33 - 8:38)
we are talking heads Google translate's (8:34 - 8:40)
gotten better and there's probably some (8:38 - 8:43)
sort of new rule that has to do with all (8:40 - 8:45)
of the AI generation that means they (8:43 - 8:47)
have to (8:45 - 8:50)
say where that kind of thing comes from (8:47 - 8:52)
which is probably why that's there (8:50 - 8:54)
uh there's an apology for an (8:52 - 8:56)
inconvenience to customers and a promise (8:54 - 8:58)
to bolster the production system to (8:56 - 9:00)
promote a re-production and shipment of (8:58 - 9:02)
products going forward (9:00 - 9:04)
uh the Pokemon company says quote we (9:02 - 9:06)
will continue to do our best so everyone (9:04 - 9:08)
can enjoy Pokemon the Pokemon card game (9:06 - 9:11)
thank you for your understanding (9:08 - 9:14)
and (9:11 - 9:14)
um (9:14 - 9:18)
for one of the sets having iono the (9:14 - 9:21)
other set has uh grusha but there's no (9:18 - 9:25)
prices about Russia (9:21 - 9:25)
that's sad (9:26 - 9:30)
[Laughter] (9:27 - 9:32)
Russia's great I don't know it's fine (9:30 - 9:36)
not an influencer though no (9:32 - 9:39)
yeah I do wonder I wish there was (9:36 - 9:41)
pictures or I wonder how uh (9:39 - 9:45)
long that line was but I was told by (9:41 - 9:47)
Andrew our Japanese correspondent (9:45 - 9:49)
that if (9:47 - 9:52)
if there's a restaurant in Japan with a (9:49 - 9:54)
line that restaurant is worth eating at (9:52 - 9:58)
if there is a restaurant with no line (9:54 - 10:02)
maybe maybe be a little cautious (9:58 - 10:02)
so we when I was there we did wait in (10:02 - 10:10)
this is this is both Greg's gonna be mad (10:07 - 10:14)
at me when I tell the story uh (10:10 - 10:14)
we were in Osaka and I I wanted to the (10:14 - 10:20)
first thing I want to do is try a (10:19 - 10:22)
Japanese Burger (10:20 - 10:25)
that wasn't like McDonald's (10:22 - 10:28)
so I found a five-star burger place and (10:25 - 10:30)
there was a line when we got there and I (10:28 - 10:33)
was like heck yeah Jeff I found a (10:30 - 10:35)
Japanese burger place near the hotel (10:33 - 10:37)
never heard of this there's a huge line (10:35 - 10:39)
for it we ended up waiting in line for (10:37 - 10:41)
like 20 30 minutes I would probably say (10:39 - 10:43)
there was like 20 people online and then (10:41 - 10:45)
when we got in (10:43 - 10:48)
the restaurant was decorated like Texas (10:45 - 10:51)
there's like an American flag on the (10:48 - 10:55)
wall there was like a skull of a buffalo (10:51 - 10:57)
and they were playing like Katy Perry (10:55 - 11:00)
and I was like (10:57 - 11:03)
this is awesome (11:00 - 11:03)
that burger slapped it was so good what (11:08 - 11:15)
about it was Japanese nothing it was (11:12 - 11:17)
just a burger you could have gotten deer (11:15 - 11:21)
no the whole staff was Japanese (11:17 - 11:27)
[Laughter] (11:21 - 11:27)
I don't say this is a great Spanish (11:27 - 11:33)
Burger (11:30 - 11:33)
it was a Japanese interpretation of (11:34 - 11:39)
America yeah it was but I didn't know (11:37 - 11:41)
that because like (11:39 - 11:43)
I used Yelp and Yelp didn't have like (11:41 - 11:47)
anything going to a burger place (11:43 - 11:50)
many other places it's gonna be American (11:47 - 11:53)
themed is my understanding well when I (11:50 - 11:55)
got to when I got to Tokyo (11:53 - 11:59)
I was looking around and there was a (11:55 - 12:02)
restaurant near our house (11:59 - 12:02)
the hotel I'm losing my mind and it said (12:03 - 12:10)
Chicago deep dish pizza and I was like I (12:06 - 12:12)
need to see how Japanese people treat (12:10 - 12:16)
Chicago it was bad by the way (12:12 - 12:19)
to start with (12:16 - 12:22)
I one quick story from my past so it was (12:19 - 12:27)
the 1980s 1986 and my brother and my (12:22 - 12:28)
mother and I went to Paris because my (12:27 - 12:31)
brother was going to college in France (12:28 - 12:34)
and about five days in (12:31 - 12:37)
my mom was like I need American food (12:34 - 12:39)
because I can't (12:37 - 12:41)
do this anywhere so we went to this (12:39 - 12:44)
American restaurant where nobody of (12:41 - 12:47)
course spoke English we thought (12:44 - 12:51)
and this was the 80s (12:47 - 12:53)
there was no such thing as a diet soda (12:51 - 12:56)
craze at all (12:53 - 12:57)
and so we're sitting in this restaurant (12:56 - 12:59)
and (12:57 - 13:01)
my mom is like (12:59 - 13:06)
man I want a Diet Coke real bad I just (13:01 - 13:09)
maybe they have a Diet Coke here the (13:06 - 13:12)
entire way staff's not speakers from the (13:09 - 13:13)
kitchen (13:12 - 13:17)
we're ahead sticks out and goes this (13:13 - 13:19)
ain't America lady we don't got Diet (13:17 - 13:21)
Coke (13:19 - 13:21)
okay (13:23 - 13:26)
that must have been kind of mortifying (13:30 - 13:35)
well on top of it on top of everything (13:32 - 13:39)
we had also is on top of us my aunt was (13:35 - 13:42)
standing in front of a boot we were in (13:39 - 13:44)
one of the biggest shopping malls in (13:42 - 13:47)
front of a booth of translators it says (13:44 - 13:49)
translators up there she turns to me and (13:47 - 13:51)
goes which one of these broads do you (13:49 - 13:53)
supposed speaks English (13:51 - 13:56)
woman leads for goes we all do Madame (13:53 - 14:00)
[Music] (13:56 - 14:00)
I have stories about the 80s in France (14:05 - 14:11)
okay so going back to the the TCG stuff (14:08 - 14:12)
here (14:11 - 14:16)
I I guess I'm a little confused because (14:12 - 14:16)
how do I put this in perspective what (14:17 - 14:23)
is happening that is different from (14:21 - 14:25)
scarlet and violet versus sword and (14:23 - 14:27)
shield where this seems to just be (14:25 - 14:30)
overall bigger (14:27 - 14:33)
do like we can look back and be like and (14:30 - 14:34)
say (14:33 - 14:37)
maybe the national decks did turn a lot (14:34 - 14:40)
of people off and now they're over it (14:37 - 14:42)
or we can look at scarlet and violet and (14:40 - 14:44)
go well (14:42 - 14:46)
fans wanted open world for a long time (14:44 - 14:49)
and we got it but both games (14:46 - 14:51)
have (14:49 - 14:53)
some would maybe say equal some would (14:51 - 14:55)
say one game has more issues but both (14:53 - 14:58)
games have issues (14:55 - 15:00)
like scarlet and violet can't even get (14:58 - 15:03)
past like 15 frames a second uh sword (15:00 - 15:05)
and shield (15:03 - 15:08)
the national Ducks didn't cause an issue (15:05 - 15:11)
with the game itself it was just a a (15:08 - 15:13)
preference that people wanted (15:11 - 15:17)
but I I suppose if I was to try to side (15:13 - 15:19)
with the people who dislike sword and (15:17 - 15:20)
shield I think the biggest complaint (15:19 - 15:22)
they say now is sword and shield felt (15:20 - 15:24)
very sterile very (15:22 - 15:26)
straightforward I don't know if I agree (15:24 - 15:28)
with that but (15:26 - 15:30)
um you know that's one of the complaints (15:28 - 15:32)
I see (15:30 - 15:36)
I still had issues with its story but oh (15:32 - 15:38)
the story is garbage yeah yeah I think (15:36 - 15:40)
we're all in agree with this I will say (15:38 - 15:42)
it wasn't until the Twitter drama that I (15:40 - 15:45)
understood chairman Rose a whole lot (15:42 - 15:46)
more because that taught me oh yeah (15:45 - 15:48)
billionaires wouldn't wait a day for the (15:46 - 15:50)
thing to be over they're just gonna do (15:48 - 15:52)
whatever the heck they want now I (15:50 - 15:54)
understand chairman Rose I get it yeah I (15:52 - 15:56)
get it (15:54 - 15:59)
laughs (15:56 - 15:59)
I don't know if it's about the video (16:01 - 16:04)
game like what changed with the TCG to (16:02 - 16:06)
make them (16:04 - 16:08)
because even when video games are huge (16:06 - 16:12)
like this is a TCG specific (16:08 - 16:16)
situation like one character (16:12 - 16:19)
suddenly becoming that popular like (16:16 - 16:24)
is it just are there a lot more (16:19 - 16:24)
ways that iono is shown in Japan that we (16:25 - 16:32)
just don't see here to really drive that (16:29 - 16:34)
if it feels it feels (16:32 - 16:38)
unusual to have this much crossover into (16:34 - 16:40)
the TCG that they sell out like that (16:38 - 16:44)
there are lines to buy it (16:40 - 16:46)
I mean iono is kind of aimed at a (16:44 - 16:50)
Japanese audience more so just in the in (16:46 - 16:53)
the type of influencer she is is my (16:50 - 16:55)
understanding we don't have that type of (16:53 - 16:59)
influencer as much here we have some we (16:55 - 17:03)
have like V tubers and stuff but (16:59 - 17:04)
um (17:03 - 17:06)
she has seemed really popular but I (17:04 - 17:07)
haven't seen (17:06 - 17:11)
excess merch access videos or (17:07 - 17:14)
merchandising or advertising in any way (17:11 - 17:17)
of her she just seems popular (17:14 - 17:19)
well they did a whole Marnie collection (17:17 - 17:21)
yeah and it's extra popular too and that (17:19 - 17:23)
sold out (17:21 - 17:24)
almost instantly when they did the (17:23 - 17:27)
Marnie collection (17:24 - 17:28)
um (17:27 - 17:30)
uh I don't know I I do (17:28 - 17:32)
I can't stop thinking about how you know (17:30 - 17:35)
sword and shield sold you know 26 (17:32 - 17:37)
million copies second best-selling (17:35 - 17:39)
Pokemon game of all time in three years (17:37 - 17:41)
and Scarlet and violet is already up to (17:39 - 17:45)
what like 23 million copies in five (17:41 - 17:47)
months (17:45 - 17:49)
like (17:47 - 17:51)
there was no secret about the issues of (17:49 - 17:54)
these games and people still bought them (17:51 - 17:56)
and (17:54 - 17:58)
are enjoying them I'm enjoying them even (17:56 - 18:01)
with the issues but like (17:58 - 18:04)
every week I'm like fingers crossed that (18:01 - 18:07)
there will be a performance update yeah (18:04 - 18:09)
uh not according to the new patch notes (18:07 - 18:12)
yeah I'm kind of I don't have any more (18:09 - 18:14)
hope for a performance update (18:12 - 18:16)
I only had hope that people were going (18:14 - 18:18)
to stop getting their games uh (18:16 - 18:21)
completely locked basically and that (18:18 - 18:25)
seems fixed now I don't think there are (18:21 - 18:28)
any reports of people having that issue (18:25 - 18:31)
since the update yet I also know that it (18:28 - 18:34)
hasn't the update didn't fix it for (18:31 - 18:36)
people who did have that bug you still (18:34 - 18:38)
have to contact Nintendo and Center save (18:36 - 18:39)
data over (18:38 - 18:41)
um but I haven't heard any reports of (18:39 - 18:43)
new people having that issue so that's (18:41 - 18:44)
exciting (18:43 - 18:46)
what are those people gonna do they've (18:44 - 18:47)
been living on that Reddit thread for (18:46 - 18:49)
the last like (18:47 - 18:53)
months they're in the anger Factory they (18:49 - 18:54)
have to get off the anger floor it was (18:53 - 18:57)
good communication (18:54 - 18:59)
they'll like make a Discord together to (18:57 - 19:03)
bond oh there we go (18:59 - 19:03)
um (19:04 - 19:08)
okay uh there okay so we do have more (19:05 - 19:11)
TCG news we're gonna shift gears here (19:08 - 19:15)
I was debating about covering this (19:11 - 19:17)
because uh speak Hannah Hannah just said (19:15 - 19:19)
good communication we want to talk about (19:17 - 19:21)
the opposite of good communication it's (19:19 - 19:24)
it's like this new story okay so let me (19:21 - 19:26)
set the groundwork because I was (19:24 - 19:28)
again I was debating about covering this (19:26 - 19:30)
because I rolled my eyes (19:28 - 19:33)
so Bobby (19:30 - 19:33)
hi to us we gotta get Bobby back on the (19:35 - 19:42)
show so Bobby texted me uh uh a Twitter (19:38 - 19:43)
thing I don't know what they're called (19:42 - 19:45)
Twitter link and in the link is a (19:43 - 19:49)
picture of a bunch of secret rares (19:45 - 19:52)
and at like a card game store (19:49 - 19:55)
and I can't remember what the the the (19:52 - 19:57)
Tweet said it was just like (19:55 - 19:59)
these were all stolen from the factory (19:57 - 20:03)
for Fusion strike and it's why Fusion (19:59 - 20:06)
strike has a bad pull rate there's a lot (20:03 - 20:07)
of cards in the picture it's just one (20:06 - 20:09)
picture (20:07 - 20:12)
and I think to myself and of course (20:09 - 20:14)
there's like a bunch of quoted retweets (20:12 - 20:15)
and a bunch of comments and it's like (20:14 - 20:17)
this is why if you this is why my Fusion (20:15 - 20:20)
right Fusion strike uh (20:17 - 20:24)
had bad polls or this is why I never got (20:20 - 20:26)
anything good for Infusion strike or we (20:24 - 20:28)
need to (20:26 - 20:30)
where's the class action lawsuit we got (20:28 - 20:33)
to do it and I'm just thinking (20:30 - 20:36)
there are a lot of angry people off one (20:33 - 20:40)
picture here with really no context (20:36 - 20:43)
besides the the Tweet itself (20:40 - 20:45)
and nothing else (20:43 - 20:48)
like we don't have like (20:45 - 20:51)
five pictures we don't have like (20:48 - 20:53)
we don't have another person confirming (20:51 - 20:55)
this we anyone who tweeted about this (20:53 - 20:59)
just had the same exact picture (20:55 - 20:59)
and then on top of this (21:04 - 21:10)
the kicker is when I dove deeper into (21:07 - 21:15)
this this picture was taken a year ago (21:10 - 21:15)
this is not new news so like this this (21:16 - 21:21)
picture of all these cards on a (21:19 - 21:24)
cheap Walmart table which is you know (21:21 - 21:25)
what you get at card shops they have a (21:24 - 21:26)
bunch of these to you know they set up (21:25 - 21:29)
for people to play games (21:26 - 21:31)
isn't even a new picture it's a picture (21:29 - 21:33)
that was taken a year ago (21:31 - 21:35)
uh (21:33 - 21:35)
and of course (21:35 - 21:39)
as this spreads more and more people are (21:37 - 21:42)
getting mad but uh there was some (21:39 - 21:45)
reporting on this this is off uh (21:42 - 21:47)
this is off Pokey Beach two articles (21:45 - 21:49)
here (21:47 - 21:49)
um (21:52 - 21:54)
so (21:56 - 21:59)
so they they open up saying like uh (22:00 - 22:06)
theft from Pokemon printing factories (22:04 - 22:10)
has always happened like it like you (22:06 - 22:13)
work on a line you grab a couple cards (22:10 - 22:14)
Etc (22:13 - 22:15)
um (22:14 - 22:17)
and that's also how we get cards early (22:15 - 22:19)
are people from the factory will take (22:17 - 22:21)
pictures of these cards so that's kind (22:19 - 22:23)
of like the opening of this (22:21 - 22:24)
um (22:23 - 22:26)
in typical Nintendo fashion the Pokemon (22:24 - 22:28)
company and its Partners dispatched an (22:26 - 22:32)
investigation team uh to plug leaks (22:28 - 22:35)
along the chains poke Beach refused to (22:32 - 22:37)
cover those leaks (22:35 - 22:39)
uh we actively follow and investigate (22:37 - 22:40)
each of them so we can understand what (22:39 - 22:42)
is happening (22:40 - 22:44)
um (22:42 - 22:44)
uh this weekend the Pokemon Pokemon's (22:44 - 22:51)
biggest ever Factory theft came to like (22:48 - 22:54)
like light on social media a photo (22:51 - 22:56)
circulating of thousands of fusion (22:54 - 22:57)
strikes secret rare cards were stolen (22:56 - 23:00)
from a factory in 2021 the photo (22:57 - 23:03)
actually leaked an internal (23:00 - 23:05)
investigation that started in September (23:03 - 23:08)
of 2021 and concluded in January of 2022 (23:05 - 23:12)
however fans just learned about it so (23:08 - 23:14)
the investigation has already stopped (23:12 - 23:17)
and finished a year ago (23:14 - 23:20)
it finished more than a year ago (23:17 - 23:20)
strike cards bounce between a few hands (23:22 - 23:27)
before ultimately being offered to a (23:24 - 23:30)
hobby store in Texas named Trading Card (23:27 - 23:31)
World (23:30 - 23:35)
Peak creativity with that name uh (23:31 - 23:37)
tell us what you need to know (23:35 - 23:39)
yeah it's all there you're not going to (23:37 - 23:42)
confuse it for something else (23:39 - 23:45)
we we were approached by an individual (23:42 - 23:47)
we being that the (23:45 - 23:50)
the trading card store approached by an (23:47 - 23:52)
individual inquiring if we were (23:50 - 23:55)
interested in purchasing hits from the (23:52 - 23:58)
set the store told Pokey Beach when they (23:55 - 24:00)
saw the seller was offering thousands of (23:58 - 24:02)
the sets rarest cards realized it would (24:00 - 24:04)
be impossible for an ordinary consumer (24:02 - 24:07)
to obtain such a concentrated amount of (24:04 - 24:09)
them (24:07 - 24:12)
uh quote the seller explained his (24:09 - 24:13)
connection to his Source we immediately (24:12 - 24:15)
contacted the Pokemon company (24:13 - 24:16)
International through proper channels (24:15 - 24:19)
the store stated the Pokemon company (24:16 - 24:21)
opened an investigation and a private (24:19 - 24:23)
investigator flew out to collect the (24:21 - 24:25)
cards from the store as you can see in (24:23 - 24:27)
the photo Pokemon expressed to the store (24:25 - 24:30)
that it was the largest return of stolen (24:27 - 24:32)
property to date the Pokemon concluded (24:30 - 24:34)
their investigation in January of 2022 (24:32 - 24:36)
which probably means they identified the (24:34 - 24:38)
original Thief (24:36 - 24:42)
they would never tell us that anyways (24:38 - 24:42)
fans who saw the photo assumed that the (24:43 - 24:49)
stolen cards have impacted their Fusion (24:47 - 24:51)
strike pull rates but this cannot be (24:49 - 24:54)
proven and it is unlikely now I did say (24:51 - 24:55)
there are two articles here this is the (24:54 - 24:56)
first one (24:55 - 24:59)
the cards would have been stolen during (24:56 - 25:00)
the production phase where they are (24:59 - 25:02)
stored in boxes the secret rares are (25:00 - 25:04)
printed separately from other cards (25:02 - 25:06)
because of their texture (25:04 - 25:09)
so a big thing I saw going around is I (25:06 - 25:12)
don't know (25:09 - 25:12)
random people on people on internet they (25:12 - 25:18)
have the wildest imaginations yeah (25:14 - 25:20)
you'd think card production works but (25:18 - 25:22)
like it's not like (25:20 - 25:24)
milk on an assembly line where you're (25:22 - 25:26)
watching glass bottles and like milk is (25:24 - 25:28)
coming out from the ceiling to fill it (25:26 - 25:29)
up and then at the end of the line (25:28 - 25:30)
there's like a little cap on it that's (25:29 - 25:32)
not how like TCG production it's not (25:30 - 25:34)
like cards are dropping from the ceiling (25:32 - 25:37)
and like somebody's like hot gluing the (25:34 - 25:39)
little attack together (25:37 - 25:41)
like no one's on the assembly line being (25:39 - 25:44)
like I want this one and this one and (25:41 - 25:46)
like I don't know how people think this (25:44 - 25:48)
works (25:46 - 25:51)
but yes the secret rares are on a whole (25:48 - 25:54)
other but like assembly because they're (25:51 - 25:56)
a different texture (25:54 - 25:59)
anyways uh the secret rares are printed (25:56 - 26:01)
on large sheets cut into individual (25:59 - 26:04)
cards and stored in Long light boxes at (26:01 - 26:06)
least five of those white boxes are (26:04 - 26:08)
packed into a cardboard box that is then (26:06 - 26:10)
set off to the machines to then sort in (26:08 - 26:12)
booster packs the machine will load (26:10 - 26:14)
different box of Cards into each booster (26:12 - 26:16)
depending on the Rarity you will see the (26:14 - 26:18)
boxes below (26:17 - 26:20)
Pokey Beach actually has like really (26:18 - 26:22)
good pictures of this we imagine the (26:20 - 26:24)
Sorting machines alert the workers when (26:22 - 26:26)
they're running low on certain Rarities (26:24 - 26:28)
meaning packs that escape the factory (26:26 - 26:30)
without the proper rate which meaning (26:28 - 26:32)
packs should not escape the factory (26:30 - 26:33)
without proper rate of secret rares (26:32 - 26:35)
otherwise it would be common for packs (26:33 - 26:38)
to be missing cards factories also weigh (26:35 - 26:40)
every single booster pack this is not (26:38 - 26:41)
only to ensure the packs have the proper (26:40 - 26:43)
amount of cards but it's also so they (26:41 - 26:45)
know what code card to insert in the (26:43 - 26:47)
packs secret rares are heavier than (26:45 - 26:49)
normal cards so lighter code cards are (26:47 - 26:51)
put in the pack to sort out the weight (26:49 - 26:54)
difference this prevents weighing the (26:51 - 26:56)
packs on the aftermarket it is unlikely (26:54 - 26:58)
that packs with improper weights would (26:56 - 27:00)
have left the factory floor let alone on (26:58 - 27:02)
a scale large enough to impact the (27:00 - 27:04)
entire run there are multiple checks in (27:02 - 27:07)
place now I want to stop here because (27:04 - 27:09)
when Pokey Beach posted this article and (27:07 - 27:11)
I saw it on Twitter (27:09 - 27:14)
and I clicked it and I read it and I was (27:11 - 27:17)
like yep that makes complete sense that (27:14 - 27:19)
this this like as I read this again for (27:17 - 27:20)
a second time (27:19 - 27:23)
this makes complete sense of how Pokemon (27:20 - 27:25)
cards like work in the factory how they (27:23 - 27:26)
get shipped out how there are still (27:25 - 27:29)
quality checks going out and then I went (27:26 - 27:32)
back and I just read the comments on (27:29 - 27:33)
this article and it's just a bunch of (27:32 - 27:36)
people being like nope you're wrong my (27:33 - 27:40)
Fusion strike was terrible therefore (27:36 - 27:43)
therefore the original one picture that (27:40 - 27:46)
I saw was completely right they stole (27:43 - 27:48)
all the good cards class (27:46 - 27:51)
action lawsuit coming your way and Pokey (27:48 - 27:53)
Beach just responded to these people (27:51 - 27:55)
being like did you even read the article (27:53 - 27:57)
and they were like nope (27:55 - 28:00)
I know that I bought 100 packs of fusion (27:57 - 28:03)
strike and I only got one good car it (28:00 - 28:03)
was (28:03 - 28:07)
mind-boggling that like (28:03 - 28:10)
uh what what is the word for it like (28:07 - 28:14)
confirmation bias maybe where like this (28:10 - 28:15)
is this is straight up cognitive (28:14 - 28:18)
dissonance right like they have decided (28:15 - 28:24)
they have decided the outcome and any (28:18 - 28:27)
prove to you otherwise is fake like that (28:24 - 28:29)
is is this classic cognitive dissonance (28:27 - 28:31)
where they are just refusing to have (28:29 - 28:34)
like it if you look at it you're like (28:31 - 28:36)
okay that'll make sense (28:34 - 28:39)
but then their brains be like but it's a (28:36 - 28:40)
lie (28:39 - 28:42)
I mean they're being deliberately (28:40 - 28:44)
ignorant they are reading the title (28:42 - 28:45)
they're reading the headline they are (28:44 - 28:47)
not reading the content of the article (28:45 - 28:49)
that explains how it works it doesn't (28:47 - 28:51)
even matter if they read it right (28:49 - 28:53)
because they would still read it and say (28:51 - 28:56)
you're wrong you're you're you're a (28:53 - 29:00)
stooge you're a sellout some people who (28:56 - 29:01)
so there are plenty of (29:00 - 29:02)
money it would come to the conclusion (29:01 - 29:05)
from the first picture (29:02 - 29:07)
the packs were worse because of this but (29:05 - 29:09)
then would also read the article and go (29:07 - 29:11)
oh wait okay that's how that works yeah (29:09 - 29:14)
but then I got a comment (29:11 - 29:14)
maybe you're probably right they're not (29:14 - 29:20)
gonna say anything they remain quiet (29:17 - 29:23)
because like oh okay I'm not gonna move (29:20 - 29:24)
on with my life I understood what (29:23 - 29:25)
happened (29:24 - 29:28)
yeah it's really could have gotten mad (29:25 - 29:29)
at the first one they could have gotten (29:28 - 29:32)
mad at the first one sure I think it's (29:29 - 29:34)
really easy to buy 10 booster packs of (29:32 - 29:37)
Pokemon magic Yu-Gi-Oh oh yeah and not (29:34 - 29:39)
get anything in a single thing and then (29:37 - 29:40)
be like (29:39 - 29:42)
man this sucks (29:40 - 29:46)
do you think this theft is why my polls (29:42 - 29:48)
and Masters have been so bad yes a (29:46 - 29:50)
million percent okay well they need to (29:48 - 29:51)
come out they need to come out with the (29:50 - 29:54)
statement then to say why my Master's (29:51 - 29:58)
polls are so bad and how the TCG theft (29:54 - 30:02)
made them enforce a mandatory bad pull (29:58 - 30:04)
rate for the next year on all gotcha (30:02 - 30:06)
everythings (30:04 - 30:09)
get it together now I paused here for a (30:06 - 30:10)
specific reason (30:09 - 30:12)
because the the first part of the story (30:10 - 30:14)
talks about (30:12 - 30:17)
how this the secret rares are on a whole (30:14 - 30:20)
different production line they're (30:17 - 30:21)
printed differently they're stored in (30:20 - 30:23)
different boxes then it goes on to talk (30:21 - 30:26)
about how like the assembly line is (30:23 - 30:28)
smart enough to weigh all of these packs (30:26 - 30:31)
there's that's why there was a black and (30:28 - 30:33)
a white code card because one was (30:31 - 30:35)
heavier than the other like there are so (30:33 - 30:37)
many quality checks before these go out (30:35 - 30:38)
the door (30:37 - 30:39)
now if we go back to the original (30:38 - 30:41)
picture there are a lot of cards in that (30:39 - 30:43)
original picture (30:41 - 30:46)
quite quite quite a bit but (30:43 - 30:49)
let's pretend we we still don't believe (30:46 - 30:52)
for a hot second the the quality check (30:49 - 30:53)
that has to go out (30:52 - 30:55)
let me let me drop this bit of knowledge (30:53 - 30:58)
on you even if the stolen cards managed (30:55 - 31:00)
to detract from poll rates Pokemon (30:58 - 31:04)
Prince billions of cards each year the (31:00 - 31:08)
theft occurred at one Factory during a (31:04 - 31:12)
print run Pokemon produces 27 million (31:08 - 31:18)
cards a day so even if that theft was (31:12 - 31:21)
successful in the sense of they were (31:18 - 31:24)
stolen off the assembly line after like (31:21 - 31:26)
weighing in production (31:24 - 31:29)
it wouldn't have been noticeable to the (31:26 - 31:30)
fact (31:29 - 31:33)
that like (31:30 - 31:33)
it it would be so hard to be like oh the (31:34 - 31:40)
this set is clearly not as good as any (31:37 - 31:42)
other sets because there are (31:40 - 31:46)
this was one Factory (31:42 - 31:49)
there's only one Factory though (31:46 - 31:51)
that's not true (31:49 - 31:53)
[Laughter] (31:51 - 31:55)
no there is there's this one it's (31:53 - 31:57)
labeled Pokemon Card Factory yeah it's (31:55 - 32:00)
they wanted to make sure that it was (31:57 - 32:03)
very clear okay (32:00 - 32:03)
so there were there were still people (32:03 - 32:07)
that were like we should sue (32:05 - 32:11)
okay I mean like you could I'm not (32:07 - 32:13)
saying (32:11 - 32:16)
what is the basis of that lawsuit I (32:13 - 32:19)
bought a 100 packs and my percentage (32:16 - 32:22)
was within the expected percentage for (32:19 - 32:26)
randomization but I think it was low yes (32:22 - 32:30)
and I like how you were to take that I (32:26 - 32:32)
hope you kept your receipts and I hope (32:30 - 32:35)
you kept all your cards specifically so (32:32 - 32:37)
I okay I don't know about you two (32:35 - 32:40)
I've bought a lot of Pokemon cards I (32:37 - 32:41)
have bought a lot of magic cards when I (32:40 - 32:44)
played competitively I would buy two (32:41 - 32:46)
booster pack boxes every three months (32:44 - 32:48)
and then from those two booster boxes I (32:46 - 32:51)
would get the I would get all like the (32:48 - 32:52)
comments and uncommons I needed to build (32:51 - 32:54)
whatever deck and then (32:52 - 32:57)
hopefully I would get like a couple of (32:54 - 33:00)
the gx's or exes and then if I needed (32:57 - 33:02)
like three but I only pulled two I would (33:00 - 33:04)
just buy a single of the last one (33:02 - 33:06)
but (33:04 - 33:08)
in reality it probably would have been (33:06 - 33:10)
cheaper just to buy exactly every card I (33:08 - 33:11)
needed not by the booster box but (33:10 - 33:14)
opening booster boxes are fun (33:11 - 33:16)
so I would buy two every three months I (33:14 - 33:18)
did this for like two or three years (33:16 - 33:20)
straight a lot of money that is very (33:18 - 33:24)
expensive yeah yep I was this is why I (33:20 - 33:26)
never got into the TCG (33:24 - 33:31)
and there there were there was a set (33:26 - 33:34)
um gosh I want to say it was plasma (33:31 - 33:37)
storm plasma front where it was the (33:34 - 33:39)
worst two boxes I have ever opened they (33:37 - 33:41)
were absolutely atrocious I didn't get (33:39 - 33:43)
anything great and like normally I was (33:41 - 33:44)
like I normally get one gold you get a (33:43 - 33:48)
couple see totally totally bad (33:44 - 33:48)
um (33:48 - 33:52)
and there have been packs I remember (33:48 - 33:54)
going to a Target (33:52 - 33:57)
at like 9 pm at night they're about to (33:54 - 33:59)
close they had like four booster packs (33:57 - 34:00)
left on their shelves I was with a (33:59 - 34:03)
friend they grabbed two I grabbed two we (34:00 - 34:05)
got to the car obviously impatient (34:03 - 34:07)
turned on the little dome light in the (34:05 - 34:13)
car we opened the four packs and (34:07 - 34:13)
out of all four packs none of them had a (34:13 - 34:18)
rare (34:16 - 34:22)
and that that could be as easy as like (34:18 - 34:22)
um (34:23 - 34:26)
somebody (34:24 - 34:27)
took the rare out and then resealed it (34:26 - 34:29)
and returned it could be as easy as like (34:27 - 34:32)
a an issue on the line like I am not (34:29 - 34:35)
saying that there are not issues with (34:32 - 34:37)
some booster packs there are a lot of (34:35 - 34:39)
cards that go out (34:37 - 34:40)
um (34:39 - 34:42)
and I'm sure everyone listening to this (34:40 - 34:44)
has at least gotten one booster pack (34:42 - 34:46)
that was missing an energy or was (34:44 - 34:50)
missing a code card or it it happens (34:46 - 34:52)
um and in that situation we I I laid out (34:50 - 34:54)
all the cards I took pictures of it I (34:52 - 34:56)
sent it to the Pokemon company the (34:54 - 34:57)
little support like they have like (34:56 - 35:00)
support.pokemon.com (34:57 - 35:02)
bad TCG it's not called bad T I don't (35:00 - 35:04)
know what it's called My TCG pack was a (35:02 - 35:06)
good enough button and then you send (35:04 - 35:07)
them a picture and you send them a (35:06 - 35:11)
receipt and they they sent four new (35:07 - 35:12)
booster packs our way it was like super (35:11 - 35:14)
nice right (35:12 - 35:18)
um I'm sure that cost them no money and (35:14 - 35:21)
it's not that big of a deal (35:18 - 35:24)
the Pokemon company did send me a (35:21 - 35:28)
booster box of scarlet and violet and on (35:24 - 35:31)
stream I opened it I opened all 30 how (35:28 - 35:33)
many packs 32 36 packs (35:31 - 35:38)
and out of the 32 packs (35:33 - 35:40)
five of them didn't have code cards (35:38 - 35:43)
randomly just randomly did just deny (35:40 - 35:45)
everything else was there just no code (35:43 - 35:49)
cards in them so again I am not saying (35:45 - 35:51)
that (35:49 - 35:54)
manufacturing or the assembly line I'm (35:51 - 35:58)
not saying that that doesn't happen (35:54 - 35:58)
but I am saying one Factory and one (35:58 - 36:05)
theft is not going to affect a country's (36:01 - 36:07)
pull rate (36:05 - 36:11)
a fusion strike (36:07 - 36:11)
uh so there was a second article by (36:13 - 36:17)
Pokey Beach (36:15 - 36:19)
which was two days after the initial (36:17 - 36:20)
article (36:19 - 36:23)
uh where (36:20 - 36:25)
the Pokemon (36:23 - 36:28)
comicbook.com the funny that we talked (36:25 - 36:29)
about comic book.com (36:28 - 36:32)
comicbook.com reached out to the Pokemon (36:29 - 36:35)
company and they got a quote (36:32 - 36:38)
and so we have the quote here so the (36:35 - 36:39)
Pokemon company says we take protection (36:38 - 36:42)
of our IP and Associated products very (36:39 - 36:44)
seriously this matter remains under (36:42 - 36:46)
investigation and we cannot comment on (36:44 - 36:48)
details at the time however we can (36:46 - 36:49)
confirm that sword and shield booster (36:48 - 36:50)
packs and products were shipped to (36:49 - 36:52)
retails as intended and there's no (36:50 - 36:54)
indication that the Integrity of the (36:52 - 36:57)
products were impacted by any confirmed (36:54 - 36:59)
or unconfirmed theft furthermore we (36:57 - 37:01)
continue to signify it significantly (36:59 - 37:05)
invest in both the production and (37:01 - 37:07)
security of our TCG business we value (37:05 - 37:09)
the faith that our fans put into us and (37:07 - 37:13)
our products and these Investments uh (37:09 - 37:15)
Investments is the word are intended to (37:13 - 37:20)
help us continue to maintain their trust (37:15 - 37:20)
and then Pokey Beach goes on to compare (37:25 - 37:31)
the poll rates (37:29 - 37:33)
of fusion strike two brilliant Stars (37:31 - 37:35)
astral Radiance lost origin silver (37:33 - 37:38)
Tempest scarlet and pop Violet and (37:35 - 37:41)
guess what Fusion strike had the worst (37:38 - 37:43)
pull rates (37:41 - 37:46)
of all of those sets naturally (37:43 - 37:50)
they just they're they're I said when we (37:46 - 37:51)
talk about the sets every time they come (37:50 - 37:55)
out and I'm pretty sure on the show (37:51 - 37:57)
I complained that Fusion strike was way (37:55 - 37:59)
too big and there was way too much (37:57 - 38:01)
filler (37:59 - 38:05)
and these sets need to not be 236 cards (38:01 - 38:07)
because (38:05 - 38:12)
that's a lot to spread out between a (38:07 - 38:13)
and then you're gonna get people (38:12 - 38:15)
complaining that someone stole all the (38:13 - 38:17)
rare cards because they're not getting (38:15 - 38:19)
any (38:17 - 38:19)
so (38:25 - 38:30)
um anyways I'm sure there's three people (38:27 - 38:34)
listening to this being like nope uh my (38:30 - 38:37)
my packs were affected right I guess (38:34 - 38:42)
but uh the interesting note is you know (38:37 - 38:42)
we kind of got a little insight on on (38:43 - 38:47)
how these these booster packs go out the (38:45 - 38:49)
door (38:47 - 38:51)
so (38:49 - 38:54)
with that we'll take a quick break uh (38:51 - 38:56)
and then we come back we got subscribe (38:54 - 38:57)
and violet stuff (38:56 - 39:01)
um so we will be right back (38:57 - 39:05)
and we are back from our break (39:01 - 39:06)
uh (39:05 - 39:11)
uh you can now register for the 2023 (39:06 - 39:14)
Global Challenge number three (39:11 - 39:16)
they are speeding through these yeah (39:14 - 39:18)
well you gotta get those backpacks out (39:16 - 39:20)
because there's no other customization (39:18 - 39:22)
possible (39:20 - 39:25)
so as of this recording they have not (39:22 - 39:27)
announced if a backpack is a part of (39:25 - 39:30)
this it says what what do you mean in (39:27 - 39:32)
the thing I'm looking at Champion boys (39:30 - 39:35)
receive an in-game Ultra Ball canvas (39:32 - 39:37)
backpack accessory and test your sales (39:35 - 39:40)
against trainers from around the world (39:37 - 39:42)
where do you see this the very first (39:40 - 39:43)
line (39:42 - 39:46)
get ready to earn championships receive (39:43 - 39:49)
an in-game Ultra Ball canvas backpack (39:46 - 39:51)
accessory and test your skills against (39:49 - 39:53)
Traders from around the world in the (39:51 - 39:55)
Pokemon scarlet and Pokemon Violet games (39:53 - 39:58)
exclamation point usually there's a (39:55 - 39:59)
picture of the backpack that's why I was (39:58 - 40:00)
like oh they didn't announce the (39:59 - 40:03)
backpack yet what does the backpack look (40:00 - 40:06)
like what does an Ultra Ball look like (40:03 - 40:07)
okay (40:06 - 40:10)
luxury ball okay he's my imagination (40:07 - 40:11)
here (40:10 - 40:14)
um so for the the other Global (40:11 - 40:17)
challenges they were once a month (40:14 - 40:20)
this is every other week (40:17 - 40:24)
on top of (40:20 - 40:24)
uh hey Bliss Blissey is back so the (40:24 - 40:28)
global challenge was this past weekend (40:27 - 40:31)
uh which was (40:28 - 40:34)
Global challenge two (40:31 - 40:37)
um and then on top of that there was the (40:34 - 40:39)
Blissey returned and then on top of that (40:37 - 40:43)
there was Typhlosion returned so again (40:39 - 40:46)
this was the the issue I have is if you (40:43 - 40:48)
want to do all three (40:46 - 40:50)
you either have to commit your entire (40:48 - 40:53)
life to Pokemon (40:50 - 40:56)
or you have to pick and choose I don't (40:53 - 40:57)
want to complain about blissy being back (40:56 - 41:00)
I am fine and happy with Lucy being back (40:57 - 41:02)
as much as it wants to be (41:00 - 41:05)
and yeah this is great to make it worse (41:02 - 41:07)
Chandelure gets released in unite in (41:05 - 41:09)
just three days yup and there is a (41:07 - 41:11)
Pokemon Adventure (41:09 - 41:15)
day going on on Sunday this as we are (41:11 - 41:17)
recording as well there is just Pokemon (41:15 - 41:20)
all through this weekend is that I guess (41:17 - 41:23)
windup return (41:20 - 41:26)
no that's coming up this today as we (41:23 - 41:28)
were recording there is a uh I forgot (41:26 - 41:30)
what they're called Adventure yes it's (41:28 - 41:33)
first on Fisk galerian and you know then (41:30 - 41:35)
I think (41:33 - 41:35)
yes yeah (41:36 - 41:39)
yeah I mean I guess it's easy to say (41:38 - 41:42)
like I don't care about competitive so (41:39 - 41:44)
that crosses the global challenge out of (41:42 - 41:46)
the list I guess it crosses all of team (41:44 - 41:49)
building slash like ladder off the list (41:46 - 41:51)
and then if you're tired of raids I (41:49 - 41:53)
guess then at that point it'd be easy to (41:51 - 41:56)
say well there's nothing to do (41:53 - 41:56)
but (41:56 - 42:00)
what other content do you want them to (41:57 - 42:02)
add like (42:00 - 42:05)
raids is something that they can (42:02 - 42:09)
add new Pokemon add new rewards a a (42:05 - 42:12)
pretty great way to get rewards (42:09 - 42:14)
um (42:12 - 42:16)
it's fun you could do it by yourself you (42:14 - 42:18)
can do with friends (42:16 - 42:21)
um if you don't want to have friends and (42:18 - 42:22)
you just want to get really angry the (42:21 - 42:24)
global challenge is right there so you (42:22 - 42:25)
can get Frozen three times in seven (42:24 - 42:28)
games that that feels really great right (42:25 - 42:30)
yeah yeah that's how it works that's the (42:28 - 42:33)
game My (42:30 - 42:36)
I would rather take the bad pack luck in (42:33 - 42:38)
Fusion strike than the the my teammates (42:36 - 42:41)
having good Frozen RNG against me in a (42:38 - 42:43)
tournament the global challenge (42:41 - 42:44)
um (42:43 - 42:47)
does award Championship points it is (42:44 - 42:49)
considered an official tournament so you (42:47 - 42:52)
can get Championship points towards your (42:49 - 42:55)
world's invite if you are in Korea (42:52 - 42:57)
or if you are in Japan (42:55 - 43:02)
um and you place highly (42:57 - 43:05)
so how that works is it will let's say (43:02 - 43:06)
like (43:05 - 43:10)
a hundred Americans placed the top 100. (43:06 - 43:12)
um for Japan and for Korea it would be (43:10 - 43:16)
your on the leaderboard (43:12 - 43:20)
with everyone else but they exclude (43:16 - 43:20)
non-japanese or Korean players so you (43:20 - 43:25)
could be a hundred and one as a Korean (43:23 - 43:27)
player and all Americans could be above (43:25 - 43:30)
you that would never happen by the way (43:27 - 43:32)
there's no world over here that would (43:30 - 43:35)
happen uh so you would be first in Korea (43:32 - 43:39)
technically so it you may if you are (43:35 - 43:41)
doing these Global challenges see a lot (43:39 - 43:43)
of Korean or Japanese players because (43:41 - 43:46)
this gets them into an official local (43:43 - 43:48)
tournament for well not local like an (43:46 - 43:50)
official huge tournament for them in (43:48 - 43:52)
their respective countries (43:50 - 43:53)
um (43:52 - 43:57)
and so I would be slightly scared if you (43:53 - 43:58)
see (43:57 - 44:00)
because they have more Stakes on the (43:58 - 44:02)
line than like an American player like (44:00 - 44:04)
yeah you get like 10 Championship points (44:02 - 44:06)
but that's not gonna (44:04 - 44:07)
that's not gonna like make or break you (44:06 - 44:09)
we're getting into like the the Japan (44:07 - 44:11)
National Tournament is like a pretty (44:09 - 44:13)
huge deal so (44:11 - 44:15)
um those players uh (44:13 - 44:17)
those players have something much much (44:15 - 44:20)
greater than us American or non-american (44:17 - 44:22)
non-korean non-japanese players have (44:20 - 44:24)
uh but anyways you can register for glow (44:22 - 44:26)
it's the same rule set as Global (44:24 - 44:28)
challenge two you can use the same team (44:26 - 44:30)
remember once you lock your team in you (44:28 - 44:34)
can't change it uh if you okay so here's (44:30 - 44:38)
my Pro tip I say my Pro tip every time (44:34 - 44:40)
if you want to get through it as fast as (44:38 - 44:42)
possible build a team (44:40 - 44:45)
that has the move explosion or (44:42 - 44:46)
self-destruct (44:45 - 44:49)
the reason I say that is because (44:46 - 44:50)
sometimes (44:49 - 44:53)
players will see that you have a team of (44:50 - 44:56)
I don't know like Fido or like Smoochum (44:53 - 44:58)
or something and they will like slow (44:56 - 45:00)
play you (44:58 - 45:04)
and they will they will make sure yeah (45:00 - 45:05)
Greg Rose's eyes because he knows it (45:04 - 45:08)
happens for whatever reason like that (45:05 - 45:09)
I'm not like if I see a team of like (45:08 - 45:11)
baby Pokemon I'm just like okay let me (45:09 - 45:12)
just one shot you out real quick because (45:11 - 45:14)
I know you just want the background (45:12 - 45:16)
right you just want to yeah but there (45:14 - 45:18)
are some players that will be like Oh (45:16 - 45:20)
I'm going to like sword stands three (45:18 - 45:22)
times in a row or I'm gonna like pretend (45:20 - 45:25)
they will like slow play the heck out of (45:22 - 45:27)
you for whatever sick enjoyment they (45:25 - 45:28)
have (45:27 - 45:30)
um if you don't want that to happen (45:28 - 45:33)
you hit the self-destruct button and you (45:30 - 45:35)
get out of there as fast yes just blow (45:33 - 45:38)
yourself Pokemon to be fast (45:35 - 45:39)
so that you don't even have to wait for (45:38 - 45:42)
the other person's setup turn to run (45:39 - 45:46)
yeah they're a choice scarf on them (45:42 - 45:46)
uh plus it's fun uh (45:48 - 45:51)
uh so yeah Global Challenge three is on (45:52 - 45:59)
its way uh as of this recording as well (45:55 - 46:01)
uh the (45:59 - 46:03)
walking wake and iron leaves will return (46:01 - 46:08)
on May 1st which is a Monday (46:03 - 46:08)
who knows after we finish recording this (46:11 - 46:15)
podcast if there's going to be a seven (46:13 - 46:17)
star raid announced they are usually (46:15 - 46:21)
announced on on Sunday nights but as of (46:17 - 46:22)
this Friday (46:21 - 46:26)
27th 28th and 29th there is nothing to (46:22 - 46:28)
report (46:26 - 46:28)
um and then the following because the (46:28 - 46:33)
global Challenge three now I do (46:30 - 46:36)
I don't think they would do a brand new (46:33 - 46:38)
Seven Star raid (46:36 - 46:40)
at the start of a global challenge so (46:38 - 46:42)
far all the global challenges have lined (46:40 - 46:46)
up with a repeat the second week (46:42 - 46:50)
so we can only hope I mean you're you're (46:46 - 46:52)
leaning heavily into that one yeah (46:50 - 46:53)
that's putting a lot of stake in the (46:52 - 46:55)
planning there these are for different (46:53 - 46:59)
types of players (46:55 - 46:59)
um (47:00 - 47:03)
who knows if they're going to do a raid (47:00 - 47:06)
this weekend since walking wake and iron (47:03 - 47:08)
leaves is coming up but if they don't do (47:06 - 47:09)
anything this would be the first weekend (47:08 - 47:12)
where we have nothing we have a while we (47:09 - 47:14)
have chandelier in unite that's what we (47:12 - 47:16)
got (47:14 - 47:16)
uh I suspect they'll announce something (47:16 - 47:22)
maybe not like a seven star maybe like a (47:19 - 47:23)
brand new we haven't had like a brand (47:22 - 47:26)
new five star in a while was the last (47:23 - 47:28)
one like armor surulage (47:26 - 47:30)
what did ditto count as (47:28 - 47:31)
well that was a five star but that (47:30 - 47:33)
wasn't like a split I'm talking about (47:31 - 47:37)
like flip sorry I've split five star (47:33 - 47:37)
like there are still version like all (47:38 - 47:41)
those splits were version exclusives (47:40 - 47:44)
yeah there's no way they ripped through (47:41 - 47:45)
all the version exclusives at this point (47:44 - 47:48)
no definitely not (47:45 - 47:50)
no they're they've beared on any of the (47:48 - 47:52)
star split ones they just weren't as (47:50 - 47:54)
exciting (47:52 - 47:56)
you didn't get a special Mark or (47:54 - 47:59)
anything on them yeah (47:56 - 48:00)
but you can complete your Pokedex (47:59 - 48:02)
without having to talk to anybody and (48:00 - 48:05)
that's it (48:02 - 48:06)
very true (48:05 - 48:08)
I mean you can still have to what like (48:06 - 48:09)
you still have to talk to somebody (48:08 - 48:11)
because (48:09 - 48:13)
the Box exclusives haven't been anything (48:11 - 48:16)
right like we haven't had a catch the (48:13 - 48:19)
Box exclusive or see the Box exclusive (48:16 - 48:21)
or no you would still need to do them (48:19 - 48:23)
specifically for karate you still have (48:21 - 48:24)
to talk to somebody from a ride on (48:23 - 48:28)
corridon and for the Paradox Pokemon (48:24 - 48:30)
minus walking wicking iron leaves (48:28 - 48:31)
because technically you can join (48:30 - 48:33)
somebody else's (48:31 - 48:35)
I I would assume that they would put the (48:33 - 48:37)
Paradox Pokemon into raids at one point (48:35 - 48:40)
I mean they have to (48:37 - 48:43)
they're doing everything else (48:40 - 48:43)
um (48:44 - 48:47)
so yeah walking wakes walking awake and (48:45 - 48:49)
iron leaves return May 1st it's supposed (48:47 - 48:53)
to last two weeks and according to the (48:49 - 48:56)
support page you can only collect you (48:53 - 48:58)
can only catch one per save file so even (48:56 - 49:00)
though they are coming back (48:58 - 49:03)
uh only one walking wake for you only (49:00 - 49:05)
one iron leaves unless you caught the (49:03 - 49:08)
egg which (49:05 - 49:10)
good on you for taking a risk and (49:08 - 49:12)
catching that egg (49:10 - 49:14)
uh (49:12 - 49:17)
good on you you can now catch one of (49:14 - 49:18)
these instead (49:17 - 49:21)
so (49:18 - 49:21)
uh we got the update 1.3.0 (49:21 - 49:27)
um (49:29 - 49:31)
that we did (49:30 - 49:35)
now that does fix the egg (49:31 - 49:35)
you cannot catch the egg anymore uh (49:36 - 49:41)
trainers who caught the egg instead of (49:39 - 49:42)
walking away from our iron leaves in a (49:41 - 49:44)
terror array Battle Before updating a (49:42 - 49:47)
1.2 we're affected by a bug preventing (49:44 - 49:49)
from Catching these Pokemon that bug has (49:47 - 49:52)
been fixed trainers who caught such eggs (49:49 - 49:54)
instead will not be able to catch these (49:52 - 49:55)
Pokemon (49:54 - 49:58)
in addition the tarot raid for these (49:55 - 50:00)
events will return around the same time (49:58 - 50:01)
as this game update (50:00 - 50:03)
the update already happened so you can (50:01 - 50:05)
do that now (50:03 - 50:08)
uh we have the the patch notes Here (50:05 - 50:11)
so feature adjustments a change has been (50:08 - 50:15)
made to deadline uh to the deadline for (50:11 - 50:19)
entries for friendly competitions uh (50:15 - 50:21)
before the change entries were allowed (50:19 - 50:23)
until friendly competition begins after (50:21 - 50:25)
the change entries will be allowed until (50:23 - 50:27)
friendly competition ends this does not (50:25 - 50:28)
have to do with the global challenge (50:27 - 50:31)
this is only friendly but ultimately you (50:28 - 50:33)
can set the rules where (50:31 - 50:34)
um (50:33 - 50:39)
you know if if you have like a 32 person (50:34 - 50:41)
tournament but only 30 people signed up (50:39 - 50:43)
tournament started you could technically (50:41 - 50:45)
have two people sign up (50:43 - 50:47)
five minutes after the tournament (50:45 - 50:49)
started to get in (50:47 - 50:50)
um you can't you couldn't do that before (50:49 - 50:52)
that's new (50:50 - 50:55)
I don't know I how many people are using (50:52 - 50:56)
the friendly tournament competition (50:55 - 50:59)
feature (50:56 - 51:03)
but they figured that that was a change (50:59 - 51:06)
uh bug fixes linked battles fixed a bug (51:03 - 51:09)
in linked battle where selecting swap in (51:06 - 51:11)
before the selection timer reached zero (51:09 - 51:13)
could fail to switch in the selected (51:11 - 51:16)
Pokemon and subsequently cause switching (51:13 - 51:21)
and the battle itself to act abnormally (51:16 - 51:25)
oh okay not sure okay fix the bug it (51:21 - 51:28)
linked battles where once the remaining (51:25 - 51:30)
time for a battle was under one minute (51:28 - 51:32)
it would no longer be displayed where it (51:30 - 51:33)
was supposed to (51:32 - 51:35)
fix the bug that occurred in linked (51:33 - 51:36)
battles where depending on what move was (51:35 - 51:38)
used at the time of a Pokemon fainting (51:36 - 51:41)
the timer uh the amount of time a (51:38 - 51:43)
trainer received to select their Pokemon (51:41 - 51:47)
was reduced (51:43 - 51:47)
good fixes (51:48 - 51:53)
yeah they've seemed very hard to (51:50 - 51:55)
reproduce but yeah that they they have (51:53 - 51:56)
been fixed (51:55 - 52:00)
uh in battles fixed a bug where the (51:56 - 52:02)
could chew ability that would be for (52:00 - 52:06)
rigor F would trigger again once every (52:02 - 52:08)
two turns after it triggered the first (52:06 - 52:10)
time contrary to what was written on its (52:08 - 52:12)
ability description (52:10 - 52:14)
so I didn't know this but there were (52:12 - 52:17)
people that would solo raid with (52:14 - 52:20)
photograph because Scott shoe would just (52:17 - 52:23)
keep active (52:20 - 52:23)
I would assume they're running like (52:24 - 52:28)
citrus barrier or something (52:26 - 52:29)
um (52:28 - 52:31)
fixed a bug that occurred with zorark (52:29 - 52:33)
ninety percent of these bug fixes from (52:31 - 52:37)
1.2 and 1.3 are just zorark bugs right (52:33 - 52:40)
apparently zorark is (52:37 - 52:40)
Pokemon scarlet and violet did it break (52:42 - 52:47)
you night Greg nah nobody bought the (52:45 - 52:50)
illusion thing around like why is this (52:47 - 52:52)
clay doll rolling towards us let's kill (52:50 - 52:53)
it (52:52 - 52:56)
fixed the bug that occurred when Zora to (52:53 - 52:58)
rationalized while using its illusion (52:56 - 53:00)
ability to disguise itself as another (52:58 - 53:03)
Pokemon on the Czech status screen the (53:00 - 53:06)
terrazolai zorarks type would display as (53:03 - 53:08)
the original type of the Pokemon it has (53:06 - 53:11)
disguised itself rather than zorark's (53:08 - 53:12)
Terror type (53:11 - 53:13)
fix the bug that occurred where (53:12 - 53:15)
zoroark's illusion ability to disguise (53:13 - 53:16)
itself as another Pokemon that had (53:15 - 53:19)
already tracelized this bug caused (53:16 - 53:21)
zoroark's type on the check status (53:19 - 53:23)
stream to be incorrect (53:21 - 53:26)
fix the bug in double battles with moves (53:23 - 53:28)
that caused stat changes for the Pokemon (53:26 - 53:31)
using the moves this bug caused the stat (53:28 - 53:34)
changes to incorrectly happen twice if (53:31 - 53:36)
the user hit the two opposing Pokemon (53:34 - 53:39)
with the move while an unopposing (53:36 - 53:43)
Pokemon was behind a substitute (53:39 - 53:45)
Pokemon go connectivity fixed the main (53:43 - 53:47)
issue the game to crash on the screen (53:45 - 53:49)
when paired with a Pokemon go account (53:47 - 53:53)
I've gotten this bug many times I'm (53:49 - 53:56)
about to send over my golden go postcard (53:53 - 53:58)
thing and everything crashes (53:56 - 54:02)
I'm very familiar with that bug uh some (53:58 - 54:04)
other bugs here fixed a bug affecting (54:02 - 54:06)
trainers who received the hisuian zorark (54:04 - 54:08)
for mystery gift as a special early (54:06 - 54:11)
purchase for the hidden treasure of area (54:08 - 54:14)
zero without first having seen zorark in (54:11 - 54:16)
their game this bug caused zorark to be (54:14 - 54:19)
incorrectly displayed at a as registered (54:16 - 54:22)
in these trainers pokedexes and then (54:19 - 54:25)
other select bug fixes have been (54:22 - 54:28)
implemented so patch notes kind of short (54:25 - 54:30)
here (54:28 - 54:32)
they're fixing things whether or not (54:30 - 54:34)
they're things people care about that's (54:32 - 54:37)
debatable they are fixing things (54:34 - 54:39)
I mean they are each (54:37 - 54:41)
important to people who would come (54:39 - 54:45)
across them yeah the the bugs themselves (54:41 - 54:47)
if somebody was to run into some of (54:45 - 54:49)
these could be a problem especially in (54:47 - 54:51)
battles especially in competitive (54:49 - 54:56)
but they're not big fixes except for the (54:51 - 54:58)
egg thing except for the catching of the (54:56 - 54:58)
egg (54:58 - 55:02)
everything else is kind of just (54:58 - 55:02)
how the Pokemon go one's pretty big I (55:02 - 55:06)
mean I had it happen like every three (55:04 - 55:10)
times if you're using that feature (55:06 - 55:13)
because I'm not going to lose my saved (55:10 - 55:15)
data (55:13 - 55:17)
um so they did (55:15 - 55:20)
some changes that were not listed here (55:17 - 55:23)
if you scroll through your boxes quickly (55:20 - 55:24)
now (55:23 - 55:27)
that's not better by the way they didn't (55:24 - 55:29)
fix it but they did add a little (55:27 - 55:31)
Pokeball symbol where Pokemon will spawn (55:29 - 55:32)
in (55:31 - 55:34)
it's not mentioned here in the patch (55:32 - 55:36)
notes but if when you go through your (55:34 - 55:37)
boxes you have to like wait for Pokemon (55:36 - 55:38)
to load in which is still like (55:37 - 55:41)
mind-boggling to me that that's a thing (55:38 - 55:43)
um (55:41 - 55:46)
I can't think of a Pokemon game (55:43 - 55:48)
where (55:46 - 55:50)
you have to like wait for Pokemon to (55:48 - 55:53)
generate in your boxes right like am I (55:50 - 55:54)
yeah (55:53 - 55:55)
like this is the first game that does (55:54 - 55:57)
that which I I don't know what the game (55:55 - 56:00)
is doing that past games (55:57 - 56:02)
didn't have the issue with but Pokemon (56:00 - 56:04)
go does it if you haven't downloaded all (56:02 - 56:07)
your assets all right that's okay this (56:04 - 56:09)
is not the same thing I think this game (56:07 - 56:12)
Can Only Hold like (56:09 - 56:16)
600 Pokemon Pokemon go is like 6 000 (56:12 - 56:20)
Pokemon yup no this is this is a mess (56:16 - 56:21)
but it's nice that there's a little (56:20 - 56:23)
Pokeball there because previously if you (56:21 - 56:24)
were scrolling through the boxes you (56:23 - 56:26)
couldn't tell which ones were empty yes (56:24 - 56:28)
yeah yeah yeah so now there's like a (56:26 - 56:30)
little Pokeball symbol that goes where a (56:28 - 56:33)
Pokemon is about to load in so that is (56:30 - 56:35)
like (56:33 - 56:38)
gives me the smallest Bit of Faith to (56:35 - 56:41)
latch on to of like oh they did (56:38 - 56:43)
something different (56:41 - 56:46)
maybe maybe something else is coming (56:43 - 56:49)
that's how they hook you in (56:46 - 56:51)
your own expectations that they're gonna (56:49 - 56:53)
do something good and they'll just (56:51 - 56:56)
stringing you along (56:53 - 56:59)
look I know that we get a comment every (56:56 - 57:00)
now and then that we're so negative (56:59 - 57:03)
about these games it's really hard when (57:00 - 57:05)
you play these games every day not to (57:03 - 57:06)
see (57:05 - 57:08)
the glaring issues that these games have (57:06 - 57:11)
yeah (57:08 - 57:13)
yeah to love these games (57:11 - 57:17)
I like them a lot too I just believe (57:13 - 57:17)
or hope that they will do a performance (57:17 - 57:22)
patch (57:21 - 57:26)
what always what always (57:22 - 57:26)
this drives me nuts about about how (57:26 - 57:34)
people you can criticize something (57:30 - 57:38)
and that is not negativity if it's a (57:34 - 57:42)
valid criticism it is a criticism it is (57:38 - 57:44)
not negativity we aren't looking for (57:42 - 57:48)
things to be negative about we are (57:44 - 57:50)
facing issues that need to be fixed and (57:48 - 57:53)
are not fixed that ruin people's (57:50 - 57:54)
experiences (57:53 - 57:56)
criticizing something (57:54 - 58:00)
is good if you're criticizing it in a (57:56 - 58:03)
constructive manner (58:00 - 58:03)
yeah I mean (58:04 - 58:09)
it's a very different topic if we were (58:06 - 58:10)
just like these are bad games they're (58:09 - 58:12)
trash Pokemon company is trash they (58:10 - 58:14)
don't know how to make anything they (58:12 - 58:15)
should pass it off to somebody else like (58:14 - 58:16)
those are just (58:15 - 58:19)
spewing negative things because you're (58:16 - 58:21)
mad which is a valid way to vent but (58:19 - 58:22)
that's not (58:21 - 58:25)
actionable like there's nothing in there (58:22 - 58:27)
that's going to make these games better (58:25 - 58:29)
like we could actually say (58:27 - 58:33)
when I do this it crashes you know five (58:29 - 58:35)
times out of ten that needs to be fixed (58:33 - 58:37)
because it's ruining my experience and I (58:35 - 58:39)
can point to the exact thing that is (58:37 - 58:40)
making it (58:39 - 58:42)
not fun for me like (58:40 - 58:44)
I'm not a huge fan of these games (58:42 - 58:46)
because they aren't performing up to my (58:44 - 58:49)
standards and when I do do raids and (58:46 - 58:52)
they hang up for no good reason this is (58:49 - 58:55)
a impacting on my enjoyment of the game (58:52 - 58:58)
I can criticize that and still say (58:55 - 59:00)
overall I love Pokemon it's like when (58:58 - 59:02)
people get mad at me when I say Gen 2 is (59:00 - 59:04)
my least favorite it's like (59:02 - 59:07)
yeah I st when it comes out I still play (59:04 - 59:09)
it (59:07 - 59:13)
like I will still play another remake of (59:09 - 59:15)
Kanto even though I do not ever want to (59:13 - 59:18)
go back to Kanto again I am so tired of (59:15 - 59:20)
gen one I do not want to play that (59:18 - 59:22)
region again yeah they sell it I am (59:20 - 59:24)
still gonna play it because I love this (59:22 - 59:26)
franchise (59:24 - 59:26)
I still think (59:28 - 59:33)
that they're they're they're still like (59:31 - 59:35)
a game plan here right like when they (59:33 - 59:38)
did 1.2 there was the the postcard (59:35 - 59:41)
golden go thing and then there was the (59:38 - 59:44)
the Vivion thing and those were two like (59:41 - 59:46)
surprises that they gave us (59:44 - 59:49)
um and I would say that they weren't as (59:46 - 59:52)
big as surprises as (59:49 - 59:55)
like the one and only update we got for (59:52 - 59:57)
Arceus Legends which (59:55 - 60:00)
I I would say that was more of an update (59:57 - 60:02)
than it was DLC but that's just people (60:00 - 60:05)
defining things differently right like (60:02 - 60:06)
yeah (60:05 - 60:09)
um we're getting paid DLC for scarlet (60:06 - 60:12)
and violet we got paid DLC for sword and (60:09 - 60:15)
shield we got a free update that added (60:12 - 60:18)
like two more things you could do in (60:15 - 60:20)
legends that you you were forced to (60:18 - 60:22)
download right like you didn't have a (60:20 - 60:24)
choice like you logged on your game it (60:22 - 60:26)
updated it gave you an extra Story (60:24 - 60:28)
Mission and like (60:26 - 60:32)
Pokemon previously not in (60:28 - 60:32)
hordes outbreaks uh we're not one (60:32 - 60:38)
outbreaks um and that's similar to like (60:35 - 60:40)
the Vivion thing and the golden go thing (60:38 - 60:41)
except you know simpler right you have (60:40 - 60:43)
to connect and then you got bonus (60:41 - 60:46)
content which is like cool (60:43 - 60:46)
I think it would be a disservice to fans (60:46 - 60:51)
for them just to be like here's Pokemon (60:49 - 60:52)
home (60:51 - 60:54)
okay now randomly ursuluna is in your (60:52 - 60:57)
game do I think that's the worst thing (60:54 - 60:58)
in the world for them to do that no (60:57 - 61:00)
because people would still be happy to (60:58 - 61:02)
get or so like I am so over the moon (61:00 - 61:05)
excited to get sneezler into this game (61:02 - 61:08)
like I just Snee I like sneezler a lot I (61:05 - 61:11)
don't know why she's a tall girl she got (61:08 - 61:13)
long legs I got an alpha shiny sneezler (61:11 - 61:15)
and I cannot wait to move her into that (61:13 - 61:18)
game she's cool I love her she got big (61:15 - 61:19)
claws (61:18 - 61:20)
um (61:19 - 61:22)
but I do think there's a small (61:20 - 61:24)
disservice (61:22 - 61:28)
in your like lore of the game to be like (61:24 - 61:30)
okay well you can just move them in now (61:28 - 61:33)
like I I I if they did what they did (61:30 - 61:35)
with Legends that's why I brought up (61:33 - 61:37)
Legends is here is a free (61:35 - 61:40)
update that you have to do and this (61:37 - 61:42)
update is going to add like a very tiny (61:40 - 61:44)
small story line to explain hisuian (61:42 - 61:47)
Pokemon maybe you can catch a few trade (61:44 - 61:48)
in the rest (61:47 - 61:50)
that would be really cool (61:48 - 61:53)
that doesn't fix the performance thing (61:50 - 61:56)
but also maybe the performance thing is (61:53 - 61:57)
a whole nother patch like we need to get (61:56 - 62:00)
these bugs out of the way uh these are (61:57 - 62:03)
all tested and working and we need to (62:00 - 62:04)
make sure that people who caught the egg (62:03 - 62:06)
cannot catch the egg again so push this (62:04 - 62:08)
out like this this is a common thing at (62:06 - 62:09)
least (62:08 - 62:11)
obviously games are maybe games are (62:09 - 62:13)
significantly more complicated than a (62:11 - 62:14)
website but when I was working on (62:13 - 62:17)
websites as a nine-to-five job we'd have (62:14 - 62:19)
a hundred things we'd have to fix (62:17 - 62:21)
but we could push out like 10 things at (62:19 - 62:23)
a time because we could test over and (62:21 - 62:25)
over that they weren't going to break (62:23 - 62:29)
the website and if we had something like (62:25 - 62:32)
Black Friday coming up we don't want to (62:29 - 62:33)
push out anything new before Black (62:32 - 62:35)
Friday because like (62:33 - 62:37)
we need the website to be working a (62:35 - 62:39)
hundred percent and then you know if we (62:37 - 62:42)
have something bigger we wait till you (62:39 - 62:43)
know after the holidays to push that out (62:42 - 62:45)
because again don't want to break the (62:43 - 62:48)
website during the busiest time so I (62:45 - 62:49)
don't know maybe I'm just being like (62:48 - 62:51)
optimistic or hopeful but (62:49 - 62:53)
like there's still a lot of time before (62:51 - 62:56)
this DLC (62:53 - 62:59)
and they seem from my perspective (62:56 - 63:02)
invested in giving us con too much (62:59 - 63:04)
content sometimes like the three events (63:02 - 63:05)
on the same weekend as a lot of events (63:04 - 63:08)
again for me who wants to do everything (63:05 - 63:12)
that's a lot if you don't if you only do (63:08 - 63:14)
one and done Typhlosion and you only do (63:12 - 63:15)
a handful of blisses and you don't care (63:14 - 63:17)
about competitive I completely see your (63:15 - 63:19)
Viewpoint as there's nothing to do but (63:17 - 63:21)
as a fan of Pokemon I want to do it all (63:19 - 63:25)
three events on a weekend it's a lot to (63:21 - 63:26)
me (63:25 - 63:27)
um (63:26 - 63:29)
but I again (63:27 - 63:32)
if they're going to do one event a (63:29 - 63:34)
weekend or two events a weekend or every (63:32 - 63:37)
other weekend until DLC we have a lot of (63:34 - 63:39)
time until DLC so (63:37 - 63:40)
um (63:39 - 63:42)
yeah and I'm very very hopeful about the (63:40 - 63:45)
DLC but I'm not sure I share that hope (63:42 - 63:48)
about the history and Pokemon I'm sorry (63:45 - 63:52)
I'm so negative on the show I'm trying (63:48 - 63:54)
to be off I'm trying to ensure hope in (63:52 - 63:57)
people I feel like that (63:54 - 64:00)
this year (63:57 - 64:02)
at the most you might get one line from (64:00 - 64:05)
NPC that says this is weird these (64:02 - 64:09)
Pokemon are ancient and new but also (64:05 - 64:12)
have we ever gotten an explanation for (64:09 - 64:14)
bringing old Pokemon from Pokemon home (64:12 - 64:17)
Pokemon Bank into a series where they (64:14 - 64:19)
didn't exist in those regions previously (64:17 - 64:21)
because there's never been a little mini (64:19 - 64:22)
storyline (64:21 - 64:24)
about that kind of thing and I (64:22 - 64:25)
understand the Hisui Pokemon are awesome (64:24 - 64:28)
I understand that Pokemon Legends Arceus (64:25 - 64:30)
was amazing and had a really cool (64:28 - 64:31)
storyline and I would love to see (64:30 - 64:33)
something like that but I don't expect (64:31 - 64:36)
it our homeroom teachers get to call us (64:33 - 64:39)
and be like hey (64:36 - 64:39)
the portal opened up you should go check (64:40 - 64:46)
it out but be careful (64:43 - 64:49)
that would be really cool yeah I mean I (64:46 - 64:51)
I hope they give (64:49 - 64:56)
story reasons for it I tend to think (64:51 - 64:57)
Hannah's correct that they're not going (64:56 - 64:59)
to (64:57 - 65:01)
um I just hope they do (64:59 - 65:03)
even if it is a couple of lines like the (65:01 - 65:05)
professor calls and says like oh hey (65:03 - 65:07)
these things have appeared or we were (65:05 - 65:09)
just are we we rediscovered them or (65:07 - 65:12)
something it is (65:09 - 65:12)
weirder to have suing Pokemon show up in (65:13 - 65:19)
Scarlet that deals with the past (65:16 - 65:22)
with no explanation or is it weirder to (65:19 - 65:24)
have them show up in Violet which is all (65:22 - 65:26)
about the future with no explanation (65:24 - 65:28)
like which is the more (65:26 - 65:30)
odd way to go (65:28 - 65:32)
thank you (65:30 - 65:32)
I (65:34 - 65:41)
know that okay so (65:37 - 65:44)
regulation d (65:41 - 65:46)
which now that I say that out loud I (65:44 - 65:50)
regret that uh regulation (65:46 - 65:52)
four whatever comes after regulation C (65:50 - 65:55)
whatever they decide to name it I (65:52 - 65:58)
believe starts on June 1st (65:55 - 66:00)
cor correct am I correct on that I think (65:58 - 66:01)
so (66:00 - 66:02)
um (66:01 - 66:06)
because regulation C started (66:02 - 66:09)
March 1st (66:06 - 66:11)
and it should be three months March (66:09 - 66:14)
April yeah that sounds right (66:11 - 66:16)
we should have still one more month of (66:14 - 66:19)
Regulation C from May to June (66:16 - 66:23)
and they said spring for Pokemon home uh (66:19 - 66:25)
which is (66:23 - 66:27)
the first day of summer is what like (66:25 - 66:31)
June 22 21st I think (66:27 - 66:34)
so we have until now until somewhere in (66:31 - 66:37)
June for them to do Pokemon home don't (66:34 - 66:40)
know if regulation (66:37 - 66:42)
d (66:40 - 66:44)
would include his sui in Pokemon but (66:42 - 66:46)
that would be like the next that would (66:44 - 66:49)
be probably the safest Assumption of (66:46 - 66:50)
like (66:49 - 66:52)
how do we add on to this because the (66:50 - 66:54)
only difference between regulation (66:52 - 66:56)
so regulation a this is competitive (66:54 - 66:58)
stuff but this kind of maybe helps with (66:56 - 67:00)
people being like okay what's what's the (66:58 - 67:03)
future of maybe where Pokemon home fits (67:00 - 67:04)
in (67:03 - 67:07)
regulation a was all of the Pokemon in (67:04 - 67:10)
the Pokedex except legendaries and no (67:07 - 67:13)
Paradox and then regulation B was all of (67:10 - 67:14)
the Pokemon (67:13 - 67:17)
and Paradox no Legends and then (67:14 - 67:19)
regulation C which is the one we're in (67:17 - 67:22)
now is all the Pokemon (67:19 - 67:22)
Paradox and the four legendary ruins of (67:22 - 67:29)
treasure and then the the also out of (67:26 - 67:30)
400 Pokemon the Pokedex the only ones (67:29 - 67:33)
that can't be used are meridon and (67:30 - 67:35)
corridon now there are Pokemon like (67:33 - 67:38)
Charizard Greninja Typhlosion those (67:35 - 67:40)
don't count because they don't have a (67:38 - 67:43)
Pokedex number (67:40 - 67:45)
um maybe they'll have a number in the (67:43 - 67:47)
DLC and they would count so you have a (67:45 - 67:49)
handful of Pokemon that just cannot be (67:47 - 67:51)
used like walking wake (67:49 - 67:54)
should be good and competitive it should (67:51 - 67:55)
be really good in competitive honestly (67:54 - 67:57)
uh especially with like torkal or (67:55 - 67:59)
whatever but (67:57 - 68:02)
not his time to shine right now he's on (67:59 - 68:05)
the back burner so if they're adding how (68:02 - 68:07)
many hasuian Pokemon like 20 (68:05 - 68:09)
24 (68:07 - 68:10)
um (68:09 - 68:12)
maybe less than that like it seems like (68:10 - 68:16)
a lot there were a lot (68:12 - 68:16)
um (68:17 - 68:21)
like now you're now you're adding on (68:18 - 68:23)
about another 20 Pokemon for three (68:21 - 68:26)
months to be competitive I I they're (68:23 - 68:28)
they're still not ready (68:26 - 68:29)
I don't think this year we ever get (68:28 - 68:31)
Corydon or maraud on in competitive (68:29 - 68:33)
because once once they do box Legends (68:31 - 68:38)
that's like end of format and (68:33 - 68:38)
are very very competitive so I I do (68:39 - 68:44)
I do think there has to be there's no (68:45 - 68:50)
doubt like (68:48 - 68:52)
before July Barcelona is going to be (68:50 - 68:54)
running around paldea like there's no (68:52 - 68:56)
doubt there I guess I guess the question (68:54 - 68:58)
is are they going to do (68:56 - 69:01)
some sort of small update like Legends (68:58 - 69:02)
which (69:01 - 69:04)
they've done it in that game (69:02 - 69:06)
um and then surprise and Delight us (69:04 - 69:08)
and then you know give us our home (69:06 - 69:12)
compatibility I don't (69:08 - 69:14)
I don't know how hard it is to be like (69:12 - 69:15)
all right (69:14 - 69:18)
home is working because the longest we (69:15 - 69:20)
had to wait for home compatibility was (69:18 - 69:22)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl which (69:20 - 69:25)
came out in October and we didn't get (69:22 - 69:27)
home compatibility I think until May so (69:25 - 69:30)
these games came out in November so I (69:27 - 69:32)
don't know maybe safe to say may (69:30 - 69:35)
um that's just literally guessing but (69:32 - 69:38)
I want to remind people that ilka helped (69:35 - 69:41)
make Pokemon home and they also made (69:38 - 69:43)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl so like (69:41 - 69:46)
if any of those two games should have (69:44 - 69:48)
worked right off the bat it was just (69:46 - 69:50)
like (69:48 - 69:50)
look they've done this time and time (69:50 - 69:55)
again like making Pokemon home work with (69:52 - 69:57)
a new Pokemon game I don't think that's (69:55 - 69:59)
the complicated thing if they are just (69:57 - 70:02)
waiting because of Regulation the next (69:59 - 70:05)
regulation or because like that is their (70:02 - 70:08)
content schedule we're doing these raids (70:05 - 70:09)
and then eventually there's going to be (70:08 - 70:12)
a small break we're gonna do an update (70:09 - 70:13)
people are gonna explore with their pal (70:12 - 70:15)
day in Pokemon or sorry (70:13 - 70:17)
um (70:15 - 70:19)
and then we're gonna go back to raids (70:17 - 70:24)
like it does seem like they wrote (70:19 - 70:27)
a Content map for this video game (70:24 - 70:30)
and people are just impatient for like (70:27 - 70:33)
the Pokemon's pacing of what they want (70:30 - 70:35)
to do because again I don't think at the (70:33 - 70:37)
end of the day they're like confused on (70:35 - 70:39)
how to make Pokemon home work with (70:37 - 70:41)
scarlet and violet they've done this (70:39 - 70:43)
with how many switch games at this point (70:41 - 70:45)
yeah (70:43 - 70:47)
copy paste (70:45 - 70:50)
copy paste copy paste (70:47 - 70:52)
oh speaking of not copying pasting (70:50 - 70:54)
there's a small issue in this game that (70:52 - 70:56)
drives me absolutely insane okay so in (70:54 - 71:00)
sort this is such a dumb issue in sword (70:56 - 71:02)
and shield when they introduced mints (71:00 - 71:04)
mints were brand new in sword and shield (71:02 - 71:04)
right (71:04 - 71:06)
that was like a big thing in sword and (71:04 - 71:09)
shield so like you you got like uh you (71:06 - 71:12)
got like uh uh I'll just use incinerar (71:09 - 71:14)
you got like a modest incinero and sword (71:12 - 71:16)
and shield modest is bad typing for (71:14 - 71:18)
instance or he's a physical attacker so (71:16 - 71:20)
you go and use an adamant mint and then (71:18 - 71:23)
it changes incinerors (71:20 - 71:26)
nature to adamant now in the in the (71:23 - 71:29)
preference it still says modest because (71:26 - 71:30)
that's what you caught him as but the pl (71:29 - 71:32)
the up the up arrow and the down arrow (71:30 - 71:35)
effectively it's changed yes so number (71:32 - 71:38)
one that's still confusing to people who (71:35 - 71:40)
don't understand Natures completely but (71:38 - 71:43)
what was cool about that is if you went (71:40 - 71:45)
and tried to give it another adamant (71:43 - 71:48)
mint it would say like it's already at (71:45 - 71:50)
like it it already has these stats (71:48 - 71:52)
and they copy and pasted that into (71:50 - 71:55)
legends from what I recall you can't do (71:52 - 71:57)
the same thing you can't give Pokemon's (71:55 - 71:58)
adamant you can't give an for whatever (71:57 - 72:00)
reason in scarlet and violet they did (71:58 - 72:03)
not copy and paste and I can give the (72:00 - 72:06)
same Pokemon like eight admit mints it (72:03 - 72:08)
doesn't recognize that I've already (72:06 - 72:10)
given it (72:08 - 72:13)
so that is it's such a minor like (72:10 - 72:15)
literally like five people in the world (72:13 - 72:17)
probably care about this but like they (72:15 - 72:21)
did it right in two games like why is it (72:17 - 72:24)
not here and to anyone to be like well (72:21 - 72:26)
don't do it like the the amount of (72:24 - 72:29)
Pokemon is just box simulator at this (72:26 - 72:30)
point the amount of times I have to like (72:29 - 72:32)
go into the PC to look at these Pokemon (72:30 - 72:34)
then go back out into my bag and then (72:32 - 72:36)
grab a mint and then give it to it and (72:34 - 72:38)
then close the bag and go back into my (72:36 - 72:40)
PC to like verify things and then oh (72:38 - 72:43)
like that was the nice thing about the (72:40 - 72:45)
mints is like I know incinero should be (72:43 - 72:47)
adamant I can't remember if I gave them (72:45 - 72:49)
the mint or not so I could like back (72:47 - 72:51)
back out go back in go back over but if (72:49 - 72:53)
I just gave him an Adam admit it would (72:51 - 72:55)
verify verbally in the piece in the bag (72:53 - 72:57)
that like oh nope he's already out of it (72:55 - 73:01)
this game doesn't do that just give as (72:57 - 73:02)
many elements as you want you're just (73:01 - 73:03)
throw no I don't know how much a mint is (73:02 - 73:07)
like twenty thousand ten thousand (73:03 - 73:07)
I mean this game is full of minor (73:08 - 73:15)
quality of life losses step backs where (73:11 - 73:18)
can I fill out on the Pokemon (73:15 - 73:20)
support.pokemon.com please fix the mint (73:18 - 73:23)
issue (73:20 - 73:23)
all right last bit of news here uh (73:26 - 73:33)
this was on Monday at 6 00 a.m uh (73:30 - 73:36)
mysterious new mysterious newly (73:33 - 73:39)
discovered Pokemon to debut soon the (73:36 - 73:42)
Pokemon company group to revealed today (73:39 - 73:45)
that trainers will be on (73:42 - 73:48)
I I never know how to speak but like all (73:45 - 73:51)
the words just fumbled all of them left (73:48 - 73:53)
they're all gone I'm so mad about the (73:51 - 73:54)
mint thing (73:53 - 73:58)
traders to be able to uncover the (73:54 - 74:00)
mystery behind a newly discovered (73:58 - 74:02)
Pokemon found in the Hidden Treasures of (74:00 - 74:05)
area zero the upcoming downloadable (74:02 - 74:08)
content for scarlet and violet a newly (74:05 - 74:11)
discovered Pokemon has also appeared in (74:08 - 74:13)
the latest anime rated series Pokemon (74:11 - 74:16)
Horizons the series which recently (74:13 - 74:18)
premiered in Japan before releasing (74:16 - 74:20)
around the world starting later this (74:18 - 74:21)
year (74:20 - 74:24)
who's that Pokemon that's what it says (74:21 - 74:27)
here this unknown Pokemon is reminiscent (74:24 - 74:30)
of the Legendary Pokemon tarapagos but (74:27 - 74:33)
its name and true nature are shrouded in (74:30 - 74:37)
mystery it is small in stature and not (74:33 - 74:39)
particularly strong but when push comes (74:37 - 74:41)
to shove it can crystallize the energy (74:39 - 74:46)
in its body to form a protective shield (74:41 - 74:49)
apparently it can also assume a dormant (74:46 - 74:52)
state where it feels that its life is in (74:49 - 74:54)
danger by pulling its head Limbs and (74:52 - 74:56)
tail into its shell and making itself (74:54 - 74:59)
look like a jewel (74:56 - 75:01)
that's it and then it just talks about (74:59 - 75:02)
how (75:01 - 75:04)
Japan is cooler than us and they already (75:02 - 75:06)
have the anime and us (75:04 - 75:09)
non-japanese folks have to wait 18 more (75:06 - 75:11)
years to get the first step that's what (75:09 - 75:13)
it says do we have to give spoiler (75:11 - 75:15)
warnings for the Japanese anime here (75:13 - 75:16)
because (75:15 - 75:18)
I mean I know we already talked about it (75:16 - 75:20)
but it's cool that there's a link here (75:18 - 75:23)
that description of the little baby (75:20 - 75:26)
terabagos actually links to what (75:23 - 75:28)
happened in the anime and when I read (75:26 - 75:31)
that description on the Pokemon website (75:28 - 75:35)
on the English Pokemon website saying (75:31 - 75:36)
that the little baby tarapagos (75:35 - 75:39)
pre-evolution probably some related (75:36 - 75:41)
somehow (75:39 - 75:43)
um can pull in its arms and legs be a (75:41 - 75:45)
little turtle pulling itself into its (75:43 - 75:47)
shell which is just a crystal pulls (75:45 - 75:49)
itself into this thing that is just a (75:47 - 75:52)
crystal I thought oh that looks like it (75:49 - 75:54)
would be liko's pendant when it's just a (75:52 - 75:56)
crystal it looks like it would just be (75:54 - 75:58)
lico's pendant and then I go and look (75:56 - 76:01)
and realize that what's been shown in (75:58 - 76:04)
the Japanese anime is that yes (76:01 - 76:07)
yes this little baby tropagos (76:04 - 76:10)
probably is just inside lico's pendant (76:07 - 76:13)
oh I didn't know that it's really cool (76:10 - 76:16)
yeah so that is her pendant yeah would (76:13 - 76:18)
be great if we could see that in real (76:16 - 76:19)
time yeah (76:18 - 76:23)
some sort of I don't know (76:19 - 76:28)
live simulcast or even a weak delayed (76:23 - 76:30)
okay also here's here's the thing (76:28 - 76:32)
because uh they they they tweeted about (76:30 - 76:35)
this on Monday morning and then I made a (76:32 - 76:37)
very sarcastic tweet (76:35 - 76:40)
being like yeah it would be nice if we (76:37 - 76:42)
could have watched this (76:40 - 76:45)
and then people are like and then I I (76:42 - 76:48)
got the stereotypical classic twitters (76:45 - 76:50)
up man Twitter is a terrible place of (76:48 - 76:52)
like (76:50 - 76:55)
classic American doesn't want to watch (76:52 - 76:58)
the sub or the yeah sub (76:55 - 77:01)
sub is subtitled yeah (76:58 - 77:06)
no average Twitter user there is no I (77:01 - 77:08)
would love to I can read you can't (77:06 - 77:11)
apparently there's no way for me to do (77:08 - 77:15)
that without pirating or going to (77:11 - 77:19)
Illegal means like if they were like (77:15 - 77:23)
here on Pokemon TV 499 you can watch the (77:19 - 77:25)
subtitle version as it comes I would say (77:23 - 77:26)
that (77:25 - 77:29)
I would give them money (77:26 - 77:32)
if there was like Crunchyroll you gotta (77:29 - 77:35)
wait two days to watch it I would do (77:32 - 77:37)
that I would I would do we would know we (77:35 - 77:39)
would already know at this point what (77:37 - 77:40)
would what had happened we would be (77:39 - 77:44)
there I would 100 like I do with all of (77:40 - 77:46)
my other animes watch it on Crunchyroll (77:44 - 77:48)
two days after because that's what (77:46 - 77:52)
simulcast means that there is there is (77:48 - 77:53)
this is the frustrating part about this (77:52 - 77:56)
news they showed a brand new Pokemon in (77:53 - 77:58)
a Japanese anime which is fine that in (77:56 - 78:01)
itself is fine and it's really cool (77:58 - 78:03)
yeah and they they have given Americans (78:01 - 78:08)
no legal or ethical way to do to consume (78:03 - 78:12)
that content like sure I could there (78:08 - 78:14)
might there may or may not be a VPN ad (78:12 - 78:17)
in this show this episode there is pro (78:14 - 78:20)
but I don't even think getting a VP like (78:17 - 78:24)
I don't think there's any streaming (78:20 - 78:24)
in Japan that I could even VPN into to (78:24 - 78:30)
watch like (78:28 - 78:33)
like it is just shown on TV there is (78:30 - 78:36)
just shown on Tokyo TV there and unless (78:33 - 78:40)
somebody is out there using a TiVo and (78:36 - 78:43)
record it does that in recording yeah I (78:40 - 78:45)
mean DVR (78:43 - 78:48)
the but that's that's people still (78:45 - 78:51)
existence they have to be right I think (78:48 - 78:54)
TiVo is still in business really (78:51 - 78:55)
if you work at TiVo and you listen to (78:54 - 78:58)
this podcast please contact us I'll be (78:55 - 79:00)
able to have a website still (78:58 - 79:02)
some of my favorite Pokemon episodes (79:00 - 79:04)
were recorded on my family's TiVo oh (79:02 - 79:07)
heck that makes me nostalgic but but (79:04 - 79:09)
this is this is the point though like (79:07 - 79:12)
there there is no way for me to watch it (79:09 - 79:15)
unless I go to some sketchy site that is (79:12 - 79:17)
probably like stealing my IP address (79:15 - 79:20)
which is like look if you want to do (79:17 - 79:22)
that that's fine but like (79:20 - 79:24)
I don't want to watch Pokemon Legends at (79:22 - 79:26)
like we're not Legends uh Pokemon (79:24 - 79:28)
Horizons at like 480p on some site I've (79:26 - 79:30)
never been to right also I don't think (79:28 - 79:32)
the Pokemon company would be very happy (79:30 - 79:33)
with me it's they listen to this podcast (79:32 - 79:36)
I'm not doing that Pokemon company thank (79:33 - 79:38)
you for making it to the end of the show (79:36 - 79:41)
I just want to watch it (79:38 - 79:44)
anyway I can like let me give you five (79:41 - 79:47)
I'll give you ten dollars (79:44 - 79:51)
who's providing the subtitles (79:47 - 79:51)
oh are they not like (79:52 - 79:57)
fan I I don't know I I I because the (79:54 - 80:00)
question is having run into fan based (79:57 - 80:03)
subtitles sometimes fans (80:00 - 80:06)
interpret things differently there are (80:03 - 80:08)
there's a number of examples of the (80:06 - 80:11)
English dubs worded it this way and the (80:08 - 80:12)
subtitles worded it this way and that's (80:11 - 80:17)
already official I have (80:12 - 80:17)
not a lot of faith in fan translations (80:17 - 80:24)
uh because fans also will interject (80:21 - 80:26)
things that they want to see in there in (80:24 - 80:28)
their word choices and sometimes they (80:26 - 80:30)
don't actually understand (80:28 - 80:34)
what is being said a hundred percent and (80:30 - 80:36)
fill in (80:34 - 80:38)
their own stuff the quality of fan (80:36 - 80:41)
translations can vary wildly wildly it (80:38 - 80:43)
can be a game of telephone (80:41 - 80:46)
to be real honest (80:43 - 80:48)
they can be good sometimes they can't (80:46 - 80:50)
get better or more accurate better and (80:48 - 80:52)
more accurate are two different things (80:50 - 80:54)
by the way then correct the official (80:52 - 80:56)
translations but (80:54 - 80:58)
they can also be much much worse they (80:56 - 81:03)
can be much worse so it (80:58 - 81:03)
again I would love for them to (81:04 - 81:12)
renegotiate how they do all this there (81:08 - 81:15)
are a ton of services this isn't the 90s (81:12 - 81:18)
anymore this isn't the early 2000s (81:15 - 81:20)
anymore I don't have to go to Adult Swim (81:18 - 81:23)
to watch anime anymore there are actual (81:20 - 81:25)
Instagram services (81:23 - 81:29)
that was my childhood I don't want I (81:25 - 81:31)
don't have to do that anymore they don't (81:29 - 81:34)
have to live this way anymore right like (81:31 - 81:37)
people are like well they have contracts (81:34 - 81:40)
guess what can be renegotiated (81:37 - 81:42)
contracts (81:40 - 81:45)
they get negotiated all the time they (81:42 - 81:47)
actually get broken all the time because (81:45 - 81:51)
sometimes the fees are way cheaper than (81:47 - 81:53)
the money they'd make off that you would (81:51 - 81:55)
not be surprised at how many companies (81:53 - 81:57)
are just like we're doing it anyways (81:55 - 81:59)
because we'll make a million dollars and (81:57 - 82:02)
the fee is a hundred thousand dollars (81:59 - 82:04)
for breaking contract yeah we'll make (82:02 - 82:06)
that profit thanks (82:04 - 82:10)
like like in America (82:06 - 82:10)
at least for my what I remember as a (82:10 - 82:17)
child they they were on WB (82:13 - 82:19)
they were for a time and there was a (82:17 - 82:21)
stretch at least at least in the the (82:19 - 82:24)
Midwest Wisconsin area they were on WB (82:21 - 82:26)
and it was a huge deal when they went to (82:24 - 82:30)
Cartoon Network yes and then it was a (82:26 - 82:32)
huge deal that they went to Disney (82:30 - 82:34)
and then it was a huge deal that they (82:32 - 82:37)
went to Netflix yeah and who knows if (82:34 - 82:39)
they plan to stay with Netflix like (82:37 - 82:41)
Netflix like Netflix's whole business (82:39 - 82:43)
model is paying a bunch of money to get (82:41 - 82:45)
exclusive content so you say signed up (82:43 - 82:47)
and then they jack up the price it's (82:45 - 82:49)
like 20 a month not for Netflix or (82:47 - 82:52)
something insane like that I mean part (82:49 - 82:55)
of the reason why WB losses because (82:52 - 82:57)
they've merged into the CW and they (82:55 - 82:59)
didn't Recon negotiate those contracts (82:57 - 83:01)
like switching networks and being sold (82:59 - 83:03)
off all the licenses went up in the air (83:01 - 83:04)
and Cartoon Network was like yes please (83:03 - 83:07)
thank you we will take things from the (83:04 - 83:09)
time that Pokemon was on WB are still (83:07 - 83:11)
kind of stuck in the contracts there you (83:09 - 83:12)
can't get the episodes or the movies the (83:11 - 83:14)
same way and some of those movies were (83:12 - 83:15)
my favorites so the fact that I still (83:14 - 83:18)
can't buy those makes me really sad yeah (83:15 - 83:20)
and then in like Canada it's not on (83:18 - 83:22)
Netflix it's specifically only Netflix (83:20 - 83:24)
for America and I think on Canada it's (83:22 - 83:27)
on telly Telly tune or something but (83:24 - 83:28)
like I don't even think that channel (83:27 - 83:30)
exists I think they just merged with (83:28 - 83:32)
somebody else mm-hmm (83:30 - 83:35)
the point being whether or not now if (83:32 - 83:36)
Ash wins (83:35 - 83:39)
[Laughter] (83:36 - 83:43)
the point being is if there again if (83:39 - 83:45)
there was some way (83:43 - 83:48)
Crunchyroll Netflix (83:45 - 83:51)
FUNimation which I also think doesn't (83:48 - 83:53)
exist anymore (83:51 - 83:53)
like they have their own service Pokemon (83:53 - 84:03)
TV like if I I just want to watch (83:57 - 84:05)
this I want to watch this anime more (84:03 - 84:10)
because you're showing new Pokemon right (84:05 - 84:10)
it's super exciting this is a whole new (84:11 - 84:15)
anime I'm super excited to watch it and (84:13 - 84:17)
I can't we can't we can't and we don't (84:15 - 84:22)
know we don't know when we can oh (84:17 - 84:26)
we have no clue when Netflix is going to (84:22 - 84:28)
decide to buy this if Netflix is going (84:26 - 84:29)
to decide to buy this whole new series (84:28 - 84:34)
we have no clue what the American (84:29 - 84:38)
front of this is going to be like (84:34 - 84:40)
Netflix can say well it's not Ash and (84:38 - 84:42)
we're done we're out and then what like (84:40 - 84:44)
we have no (84:42 - 84:47)
clue when we're gonna get this (84:44 - 84:50)
I'm still waiting to finish Ash's (84:47 - 84:52)
Journey (84:50 - 84:54)
and I don't know when I'm getting that (84:52 - 84:56)
probably September Maybe (84:54 - 84:59)
Netflix has also been proven to take (84:56 - 85:02)
shows that are on the top 10 most (84:59 - 85:05)
watched and not renew them yep (85:02 - 85:08)
and that to be fair I I get it right (85:05 - 85:10)
like there there is a sense of like (85:08 - 85:12)
season one will always bring in new (85:10 - 85:14)
people especially if it's really hyped (85:12 - 85:15)
season two kind of the same thing (85:14 - 85:17)
because people want to come back to (85:15 - 85:18)
watch season two but like if you missed (85:17 - 85:20)
out season one or season two advertising (85:18 - 85:23)
a season three of a show isn't going to (85:20 - 85:25)
get more people to sign up because they (85:23 - 85:27)
don't care they didn't see the first two (85:25 - 85:29)
seasons right unless your trailer is (85:27 - 85:31)
really good so I understand the idea of (85:29 - 85:34)
like Netflix wants new people to (85:31 - 85:36)
constantly sign up and new shows bring (85:34 - 85:38)
in new people (85:36 - 85:41)
however a recent study came out to show (85:38 - 85:44)
that their business plan is backfiring (85:41 - 85:46)
correct yes because a ton of people (85:44 - 85:48)
aren't watching the first season because (85:46 - 85:49)
they're like why would I get invested (85:48 - 85:51)
you're just going to take it away from (85:49 - 85:55)
me like like (85:51 - 85:55)
in a time of streaming (85:56 - 86:01)
to sort of have the logic of well why (85:59 - 86:05)
advertise a season three because (86:01 - 86:07)
they don't know what it is (86:05 - 86:09)
the other two seasons are there if (86:07 - 86:11)
there's hype about it like look at (86:09 - 86:13)
stranger things stranger things still (86:11 - 86:15)
brings in people one could argue that (86:13 - 86:18)
the recent Seasons might not be great (86:15 - 86:20)
but (86:18 - 86:20)
the people have gone back and watched (86:21 - 86:26)
them right when they're readily (86:24 - 86:28)
available they will go back to catch up (86:26 - 86:30)
if you build enough hype about them it's (86:28 - 86:32)
just advertise Netflix really doesn't (86:30 - 86:34)
want to do advertisement or promotion (86:32 - 86:36)
they don't like it for whatever reason (86:34 - 86:38)
they just are like (86:36 - 86:41)
rise and sync on your own (86:38 - 86:43)
wee out (86:41 - 86:44)
yeah the I mean there's like more (86:43 - 86:46)
problems to like Netflix like at least (86:44 - 86:50)
like peacock or (86:46 - 86:52)
Apple TV plus they have huge companies (86:50 - 86:54)
back or Amazon is another good example (86:52 - 86:56)
like it doesn't matter if Amazon video (86:54 - 86:58)
doesn't make money they literally have (86:56 - 87:01)
the money of Amazon behind them Netflix (86:58 - 87:03)
doesn't have that they they just have (87:01 - 87:06)
themselves they don't have like anything (87:03 - 87:09)
else like I I maybe I explained that (87:06 - 87:11)
poorly though but like Amazon can has so (87:09 - 87:13)
many other services that can pay for (87:11 - 87:16)
Amazon TV Apple has so many other (87:13 - 87:17)
services that can pay for Apple TV (87:16 - 87:20)
Netflix just has themselves they don't (87:17 - 87:23)
have like watches the sounds of the (87:20 - 87:26)
large company are profitable which will (87:23 - 87:28)
help Shore up any shortcomings from (87:26 - 87:32)
another area so Amazon still makes a (87:28 - 87:34)
trillion billion dollars it doesn't (87:32 - 87:37)
matter necessarily (87:34 - 87:40)
that the video segment doesn't make it (87:37 - 87:42)
that is that it comes with a huge (87:40 - 87:46)
asterisk where underperforming things do (87:42 - 87:48)
tend to get cut when they think (87:46 - 87:50)
you're just not doing it anymore so it's (87:48 - 87:53)
like the worry about Amazon's video is (87:50 - 87:56)
if it stops performing (87:53 - 87:57)
they could just say we're ending the (87:56 - 88:00)
service and all that content goes away (87:57 - 88:02)
it is it is the problem of the (88:00 - 88:04)
subscription model that we are facing (88:02 - 88:06)
right now is that large corporations can (88:04 - 88:09)
decide when something isn't profitable (88:06 - 88:10)
anymore (88:09 - 88:12)
we're going to get rid of it and you (88:10 - 88:14)
have lost access to all of that that's (88:12 - 88:17)
why I still say if you can purchase (88:14 - 88:20)
physical and you really really want it (88:17 - 88:24)
purchase physical believe me I thought V (88:20 - 88:28)
VCRs would no longer be made they're (88:24 - 88:31)
still making them like there's they're (88:28 - 88:33)
more expensive we all thought we had (88:31 - 88:36)
moved past the scratchy hiss of record (88:33 - 88:38)
players (88:36 - 88:38)
so like (88:40 - 88:45)
on a side note I treated myself to that (88:42 - 88:47)
like very expensive Pokemon vinyl player (88:45 - 88:49)
because I thought (88:47 - 88:51)
I I do have a bunch of vinyls and then I (88:49 - 88:54)
threw I donated my vinyl player when I (88:51 - 88:55)
moved because it was like I needed a new (88:54 - 88:57)
needle and it was like weird to package (88:55 - 88:58)
up so I like (88:57 - 89:01)
gave it to somebody for like 20 bucks (88:58 - 89:03)
um and then I was like you know what (89:01 - 89:05)
like I think this final player for (89:03 - 89:07)
Pokemon is like really cool if anything (89:05 - 89:09)
because I don't listen to that much (89:07 - 89:11)
music I want it as like a collector's (89:09 - 89:12)
like (89:11 - 89:14)
this will be like in like 20 years (89:12 - 89:15)
they'll be like wait Pokemon made a (89:14 - 89:18)
record player and be like yeah it has (89:15 - 89:21)
Pikachu on it they also made a waffle (89:18 - 89:22)
iron and (89:21 - 89:27)
a crock pot I have the waffle iron I (89:22 - 89:29)
believe Nick who does the music for the (89:27 - 89:33)
show got me that as a gift so thank you (89:29 - 89:36)
Nick uh I've used it once it's and then (89:33 - 89:38)
I cleaned it immediately because waffle (89:36 - 89:43)
irons anyways I have no Fidelity maybe (89:38 - 89:45)
that's not the right word in my ears I (89:43 - 89:48)
can't hear the difference between my low (89:45 - 89:51)
end record player that I got rid of and (89:48 - 89:52)
this high-end Pokemon record player (89:51 - 89:54)
because it's made by U-turn which is (89:52 - 89:56)
like high-end like very fancy oh like (89:54 - 89:59)
you have a U-turn record I I literally (89:56 - 90:03)
cannot hear the difference uh but I was (89:59 - 90:04)
at a record shop and it was very cool (90:03 - 90:06)
there was something about like thumbing (90:04 - 90:08)
through records (90:06 - 90:11)
that is very I don't know it's it's (90:08 - 90:16)
silly anyways it's very nice in the 70s (90:11 - 90:16)
Craig was like this is this is (90:16 - 90:20)
mainstream when I was this is this is (90:18 - 90:22)
the only option do you know how exciting (90:20 - 90:26)
it was to have compact discs that had (90:22 - 90:28)
lossless sound for the first time (90:26 - 90:31)
because (90:28 - 90:33)
when your only option is to play a (90:31 - 90:36)
record player and play that record to (90:33 - 90:39)
death by by your 500th player like (90:36 - 90:42)
there's music somewhere in the hissing (90:39 - 90:44)
and popping I'm pretty sure of it I'm (90:42 - 90:46)
mostly going off of memory at this point (90:44 - 90:49)
I'm very excited and (90:46 - 90:52)
cassette tapes degrading and then also (90:49 - 90:54)
tearing because they would tear all the (90:52 - 90:56)
like you'd open up and you're like well (90:54 - 90:58)
it's just a mangle of mesh right now I (90:56 - 91:02)
guess this is done compact discs (90:58 - 91:05)
changed our lives because we had to have (91:02 - 91:08)
the anti-skip player you had to spend (91:05 - 91:09)
the extra money for the anti-skip (91:08 - 91:14)
technology like my dad bought the very (91:09 - 91:16)
first compact disc player and we had no (91:14 - 91:17)
idea (91:16 - 91:20)
what it could do and so he put in the (91:17 - 91:22)
1812 Overture because it said with real (91:20 - 91:23)
cannons (91:22 - 91:26)
and so we got to that part and we were (91:23 - 91:27)
cranked it up because you could finally (91:26 - 91:30)
hear everything perfect and the Cannons (91:27 - 91:31)
of it off and both of the exposures (91:30 - 91:34)
exploded it was a boom (91:31 - 91:36)
and then there was no more sound because (91:34 - 91:38)
we had blown everything out (91:36 - 91:42)
that's incredible (91:38 - 91:42)
good time I'm I I miss my CD player (91:42 - 91:48)
see I think isn't isn't like technically (91:45 - 91:50)
CD players play more high quality music (91:48 - 91:53)
than vinyls or did they change vinyl (91:50 - 91:56)
technology better the first play of (91:53 - 92:00)
vinyl is the best sound reproduction you (91:56 - 92:03)
can get so the very first time you (92:00 - 92:04)
listen to a vinyl record it would be of (92:03 - 92:07)
a higher quality than you can get on a (92:04 - 92:09)
CD because of compression and other (92:07 - 92:11)
another weird balancing but isn't that (92:09 - 92:14)
why you want a very nice needle yes so (92:11 - 92:19)
you don't degrade the sound correct (92:14 - 92:23)
after the first play vinyl degrades (92:19 - 92:25)
pretty quickly (92:23 - 92:27)
because you have a needle scraping (92:25 - 92:30)
across plastic I don't know if you've (92:27 - 92:31)
ever taken a needle and scraped it (92:30 - 92:34)
across plastic it tends to leave some (92:31 - 92:35)
marks (92:34 - 92:37)
especially if you have kids and they (92:35 - 92:38)
jump around and the needle skips because (92:37 - 92:40)
it will run across things and (92:38 - 92:44)
more work in the day and stack records (92:40 - 92:46)
on top of the needle so that when it was (92:44 - 92:47)
done with one side it would drop the (92:46 - 92:49)
next record (92:47 - 92:51)
uh so you just have this wad of Records (92:49 - 92:53)
on top and then it would finish one side (92:51 - 92:54)
it would go off and it would drop and (92:53 - 92:56)
sometimes that timing would be off so it (92:54 - 92:58)
hit the needle or like forward drop (92:56 - 93:01)
instead of one you know back in the day (92:58 - 93:03)
we lived with what we could take (93:01 - 93:06)
Nick and I were looking at vinyls for (93:03 - 93:09)
uh like a couple of like the popular (93:06 - 93:11)
songs that Nick does for the break music (93:09 - 93:14)
and the the problem was whether you made (93:11 - 93:16)
one vinyl or a hundred vinyls you had to (93:14 - 93:20)
just pay a flat fee for the pressing yep (93:16 - 93:22)
um which was like the like (93:20 - 93:25)
the biggest hurdle like if we knew we (93:22 - 93:27)
could sell (93:25 - 93:29)
gosh I think you needed to sell like (93:27 - 93:32)
18 finals to break even just to break (93:29 - 93:34)
even yeah to sell 18 vinyls and then if (93:32 - 93:36)
you sold 20 you would only make like a (93:34 - 93:38)
four dollar profit well like we weren't (93:36 - 93:41)
looking to profit it was just like (93:38 - 93:44)
pressing making shipping out vinyl is (93:41 - 93:47)
also not very convenient like do not (93:44 - 93:50)
Bend yeah yeah (93:47 - 93:52)
um (93:50 - 93:54)
but we make cassettes that was cool I (93:52 - 93:55)
have a bunch of I think I have a couple (93:54 - 93:56)
of cassettes left we should put those up (93:55 - 94:00)
when our anniversary comes which is July (93:56 - 94:02)
anyways uh (94:00 - 94:04)
if there was a legal way to watch the (94:02 - 94:06)
Pokemon anime (94:04 - 94:08)
please provide one there's I know (94:06 - 94:11)
there's not that was rhetorical uh your (94:08 - 94:13)
comments are gonna be loaded up with (94:11 - 94:14)

Sesame Street kids record player uh that (95:25 - 95:32)

just plugged headphones into (95:46 - 95:50)
because that's where I was at (95:48 - 95:54)
the first Walkman I ever got was actual (95:50 - 95:55)
metal and you could (95:54 - 95:57)
you could hurt somebody with that thing (95:55 - 96:01)
