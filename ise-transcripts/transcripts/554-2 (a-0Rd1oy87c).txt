minute show on Monday I'm giving you two (1:38 - 1:43)
one hour shows broken in half if you're (1:40 - 1:45)
the logistical reasons of why this is (1:43 - 1:49)
still 544 not 5 45 555 is literally just (1:45 - 1:51)
add purposes (1:49 - 1:53)

lot of stuff announced uh we're gonna (1:56 - 2:00)
we're trying to keep this an hour so (1:59 - 2:02)
we're gonna focus on the scarlet and (2:00 - 2:04)
violet DLC (2:02 - 2:05)
I know there's Pokemon sleep and some (2:04 - 2:08)

big announcement here we're gonna we're (2:41 - 2:44)
gonna spend the next 55 minutes talking (2:43 - 2:46)
about a three minute trailer (2:44 - 2:49)
from a 22 minute trailer (2:46 - 2:49)
um (2:49 - 2:51)
so uh (2:49 - 2:54)
today this is the press release by the (2:51 - 2:55)
way (2:54 - 2:56)
I'm trying to get through all of this (2:55 - 2:58)
today on Pokemon day during a special (2:56 - 3:00)
Pokemon presents video presentation that (2:58 - 3:02)
was streamed online to fans around the (3:00 - 3:04)
world the Pokemon company announced the (3:02 - 3:07)
hidden treasure of area zero that's a (3:04 - 3:10)
mouthful of a DLC new downloadable (3:07 - 3:11)
content for the Blockbuster Pokemon (3:10 - 3:13)
scarlet and Pokemon Violet video games (3:11 - 3:15)
Global sales of the Pokemon scarlet and (3:13 - 3:17)
violet video games for the Nintendo (3:15 - 3:19)
switch has surpassed 10 million combined (3:17 - 3:20)
units after the first three days (3:19 - 3:24)
worldwide uh on November 18th (3:20 - 3:27)
uh the highest grossing the highest (3:24 - 3:30)
Global sales of for any software on a (3:27 - 3:33)
Nintendo platform within that time frame (3:30 - 3:35)
the Hidden Treasures of air the hidden (3:33 - 3:37)
treasure of area zero will take fans (3:35 - 3:39)
deeper into the world of Pokemon Scarlet (3:37 - 3:41)
or Pokemon Violet consisting of two (3:39 - 3:43)
different Adventures both games get the (3:41 - 3:45)
same two Adventures I know that's (3:43 - 3:47)
confusing we had the same confusion (3:45 - 3:49)
during sword and shield (3:47 - 3:52)
the they the Pokemon company put in an (3:49 - 3:54)
infographic on how to not purchase the (3:52 - 3:56)
wrong DLC this time around but uh two (3:54 - 3:58)
different adventures part one is called (3:56 - 4:02)
the the teal mask that will launch in (3:58 - 4:05)
Fall of 2023 (4:02 - 4:06)
um don't worry we'll bust out the (4:05 - 4:08)
calendars for you guys and then part two (4:06 - 4:11)
which is called the Indigo disc we'll (4:08 - 4:14)
release at a later date (4:11 - 4:17)
fans can purchase the hidden treasure uh (4:14 - 4:21)
of area zero now on the Nintendo eShop (4:17 - 4:24)
Okay so (4:21 - 4:24)
so two DLCs same as sword and shield uh (4:26 - 4:35)
I believe we got June and October for (4:31 - 4:38)
yeah I love armor and Crown no one is (4:35 - 4:40)
going to be able to convince me except (4:38 - 4:43)
for if a game freak Dev speaks to me (4:40 - 4:45)
specifically nobody is gonna except for (4:43 - 4:47)
that nobody's gonna be able to convince (4:45 - 4:49)
me that the first one of these DLCs (4:47 - 4:51)
wasn't meant to be a summer DLC because (4:49 - 4:53)
that's a Summer Festival the trailer (4:51 - 4:56)
opened into a summer Japanese (4:53 - 4:59)
Countryside this is like summer vacation (4:56 - 5:03)
kind of theme from anime this was (4:59 - 5:05)
as far as I can tell intended to be a (5:03 - 5:07)
summer DLC (5:05 - 5:10)
but it's coming out in the fall I I (5:07 - 5:11)
agree with you (5:10 - 5:15)
um I I don't think I agree that it was (5:11 - 5:18)
probably supposed to be June July but I (5:15 - 5:19)
don't (5:18 - 5:21)
I'm not upset that they're like we (5:19 - 5:24)
probably need more time (5:21 - 5:27)
and we're not gonna know why but yeah I (5:24 - 5:31)
agree I think we we kind of know why we (5:27 - 5:34)
know why we kind of know why (5:31 - 5:36)
but yeah no they they almost definitely (5:34 - 5:38)
push this one back this (5:36 - 5:41)
feels like I said like a summer vacation (5:38 - 5:43)
episode of an anime and it's based off (5:41 - 5:47)
of a old Japanese story that has been (5:43 - 5:50)
repeated for many many years (5:47 - 5:52)
as are the Pokemon (5:50 - 5:56)
um so there's uh (5:52 - 5:58)
a little bit of confusion here (5:56 - 6:00)
um with with release dates again we'll (5:58 - 6:02)
bust out the calendar (6:00 - 6:03)
um I'm reading the official press (6:02 - 6:06)
release this is the same thing they this (6:03 - 6:07)
is the press release they email to (6:06 - 6:10)
outlets you know Sarah B comicbook.com (6:07 - 6:13)
IGN etc etc whether people want to (6:10 - 6:14)
report on those press releases is up to (6:13 - 6:17)
the website same press release here they (6:14 - 6:19)
say uh (6:17 - 6:23)
fall of 2023 for teal mask and a later (6:19 - 6:25)
date for Indigo disc this press release (6:23 - 6:27)
went out at 6 30 A.M (6:25 - 6:30)
Pacific time this morning but on (6:27 - 6:34)
pokemon.com the official Pokemon website (6:30 - 6:37)
uh and I just read from official Pokemon (6:34 - 6:40)
release the teal mask they say is stated (6:37 - 6:43)
for fall of 2023 release date subject to (6:40 - 6:44)
change (6:43 - 6:47)
and then Indigo disc is related for (6:44 - 6:50)
winter of 2023 subject (6:47 - 6:54)
uh to change right that's what it was in (6:50 - 6:56)
the announcement today too that was what (6:54 - 6:59)
it was in the video as well in the video (6:56 - 7:01)
um and now the the Third (6:59 - 7:06)
uh calendar is if you go to the eShop (7:01 - 7:07)
um (7:06 - 7:11)
the teal mask says December 31st or (7:07 - 7:14)
whatever 2023 and then the hidden (7:11 - 7:16)
treasure or in the Indigo disc is like (7:14 - 7:19)
April 30th 2024. (7:16 - 7:21)
um last time I checked (7:19 - 7:25)
April of 2024 is not the same as winter (7:21 - 7:30)
of 2023. uh it might be April and there (7:25 - 7:33)
might be snow on the ground in April but (7:30 - 7:35)
that doesn't mean that is winter because (7:33 - 7:39)
spring starts March 21st there's been (7:35 - 7:41)
other examples of Isha updates being (7:39 - 7:45)
incorrect right yes yeah yeah I think (7:41 - 7:49)
eShop needs a placeholder of some sort (7:45 - 7:50)
makes sense (7:49 - 7:52)
so (7:50 - 7:55)
so logistically (7:52 - 8:01)
if we're fall begins in October correct (7:55 - 8:04)
or is it September December 21st (8:01 - 8:06)
September 21st yeah and then winter (8:04 - 8:11)
begins December 21st so that's a (8:06 - 8:13)
two-week window (8:11 - 8:15)
in Winter (8:13 - 8:20)
2023 for this game to come out (8:15 - 8:20)
um yeah but there's a difference between (8:20 - 8:24)
when it feels like winter and when it's (8:22 - 8:27)
actually technically winter yeah (8:24 - 8:27)
so (8:28 - 8:30)
if they're doing December you have you (8:31 - 8:39)
have the 8th the 15th the 22nd the 29th (8:34 - 8:41)
I don't see anything really wrong with (8:39 - 8:43)
the 22nd which is the day after (8:41 - 8:45)
winter technically begins on a calendar (8:43 - 8:48)
that's right before Christmas that's (8:45 - 8:51)
still pretty good marketing (8:48 - 8:53)
um that's still like people are getting (8:51 - 8:56)
the games like or I got an eShop gift (8:53 - 8:58)
card for Christmas I want (8:56 - 8:59)
to get the DLC (8:58 - 9:01)
kind of thing that's true because (8:59 - 9:03)
there's no physical (9:01 - 9:05)
they eventually did a physical thing for (9:03 - 9:06)
sword and shields didn't they but that (9:05 - 9:09)
was quite a bit later (9:06 - 9:11)
they had download cards for them and I (9:09 - 9:13)
think they did physical release as well (9:11 - 9:15)
I think the physical release came a (9:13 - 9:18)
month later though what was the day of I (9:15 - 9:20)
don't think it was damn no it wasn't (9:18 - 9:23)
Dave no it wasn't which is why that (9:20 - 9:24)
close to Christmas wouldn't really (9:23 - 9:26)
affect if they did if they were going to (9:24 - 9:28)
do physical at some point it would it (9:26 - 9:30)
wouldn't probably wouldn't be day one so (9:28 - 9:33)
and then we have um (9:30 - 9:36)
you know the the thing we should really (9:33 - 9:38)
look at I should get like one of those (9:36 - 9:39)
bulletin boards and like all those like (9:38 - 9:41)
arrows and strings is like we need to (9:39 - 9:45)
find the dates in October that are (9:41 - 9:47)
Community Day weekends and the dates (9:45 - 9:50)
that are that are tournaments (9:47 - 9:52)
and that's where they intersect correct (9:50 - 9:54)
and that is the day the DLC will come (9:52 - 9:57)
out because as we talked about before (9:54 - 9:59)
they love throwing everything on the (9:57 - 10:00)
same weekend (9:59 - 10:02)
um (10:00 - 10:05)
uh overall though uh (10:02 - 10:07)
I'm pretty okay with waiting (10:05 - 10:09)
um (10:07 - 10:11)
if they need more time they need more (10:09 - 10:13)
time uh it might feel a little weird to (10:11 - 10:16)
have DLC and I don't know as early as (10:13 - 10:18)
September and then have it again and (10:16 - 10:19)
in (10:18 - 10:21)
December I don't think that's a bad (10:19 - 10:22)
thing it's just you know something we (10:21 - 10:24)
haven't had before (10:22 - 10:27)
yeah I think I think it's fine (10:24 - 10:29)
um there's obviously other games coming (10:27 - 10:32)
out in the uh right before summer I (10:29 - 10:34)
think the Zelda for one uh that I think (10:32 - 10:36)
will keep plenty of people busy keep me (10:34 - 10:38)
busy um so I don't mind having the fall (10:36 - 10:42)
the fall release uh I think (10:38 - 10:44)
they've shown us over the last (10:42 - 10:47)
a couple years like moving things around (10:44 - 10:48)
a little bit like having Legends Arceus (10:47 - 10:50)
come out in January right like just (10:48 - 10:52)
moving things around and I think it was (10:50 - 10:55)
fine so just another part of the Year (10:52 - 10:56)
where we'll get the the first one I (10:55 - 10:58)
think that's totally fine uh I don't (10:56 - 10:59)
think (10:58 - 11:01)
it'll be (10:59 - 11:04)
I don't think it'll be so heavy that it (11:01 - 11:06)
would run into if they did like an end (11:04 - 11:08)
of December second DLC I don't think it (11:06 - 11:10)
would be like Oh I'm not even done with (11:08 - 11:13)
part one uh but that also could be (11:10 - 11:14)
helpful if they come out kind of closer (11:13 - 11:17)
together and get everybody already hyped (11:14 - 11:19)
up on the first one the second one comes (11:17 - 11:20)
closer and then you're rolling right (11:19 - 11:22)
into the second one (11:20 - 11:25)
um if the two are actually related at (11:22 - 11:25)
all (11:25 - 11:27)
cool just to get just to have people (11:25 - 11:29)
playing I mean not even like if they're (11:27 - 11:31)
related but just what we were saying (11:29 - 11:34)
last time with uh summer and then I (11:31 - 11:36)
guess it was fall last with sword and (11:34 - 11:40)
shield October Crown Tundra yeah 100 (11:36 - 11:41)
count Tundra for the end of October I (11:40 - 11:43)
just felt like there wasn't (11:41 - 11:46)
as much hype on the second one (11:43 - 11:47)
maybe this would be different if they're (11:46 - 11:48)
a little bit closer together but just (11:47 - 11:50)
further into the year if you don't put (11:48 - 11:51)
down the game for as long in between (11:50 - 11:54)
right I would (11:51 - 11:56)
there is something for me uh this is (11:54 - 11:59)
just a personal thing there is something (11:56 - 12:02)
that Pokemon like the weekend before (11:59 - 12:05)
Thanksgiving just feels (12:02 - 12:07)
like the start of a holiday or something (12:05 - 12:09)
of like (12:07 - 12:12)
so many Pokemon games just come out in (12:09 - 12:14)
middle of November and I just have so (12:12 - 12:16)
many memories or personal experiences of (12:14 - 12:17)
like (12:16 - 12:20)
uh you know when I had a traditional job (12:17 - 12:23)
of like and taking this weekend off and (12:20 - 12:24)
might as well just take the three days (12:23 - 12:25)
before Thanksgiving and have the whole (12:24 - 12:28)
week and do Pokemon and (12:25 - 12:30)
um you see family or friends uh and (12:28 - 12:32)
they're doing Pokemon and that's like (12:30 - 12:33)
the thing you talk about over the (12:32 - 12:37)
holidays and it was a little weird for (12:33 - 12:40)
Crown Tundra to be in October because it (12:37 - 12:41)
was still exciting it was still fun it (12:40 - 12:43)
was still great but then that November (12:41 - 12:45)
came and it felt a little empty for me (12:43 - 12:48)
at least again I'm maybe other people (12:45 - 12:50)
can't relate (12:48 - 12:52)
it could be November that's still fall (12:50 - 12:56)
yes it could be a little bit further in (12:52 - 12:59)
um they I guess if we're not going to go (12:56 - 13:01)
off any patterns but the last time there (12:59 - 13:03)
was a fall release it was October so I (13:01 - 13:05)
mean if you stick with it you know end (13:03 - 13:07)
of October yeah (13:05 - 13:09)
November still (13:07 - 13:11)
yeah oh right but I mean like for the (13:09 - 13:13)
DLC oh yeah yeah for count Tundra it was (13:11 - 13:16)
end of October so could could do it (13:13 - 13:17)
again for part one (13:16 - 13:19)
I got a quote here we are grateful that (13:17 - 13:20)
millions of Traders around the world (13:19 - 13:22)
have chosen to explore the expansive (13:20 - 13:24)
paldeo region said ishihara president (13:22 - 13:27)
CEO of the Pokemon company in the hidden (13:24 - 13:29)
treasure of area zero fans will take a (13:27 - 13:31)
trip to the land of kitakami where they (13:29 - 13:33)
will meet new Pokemon and interesting (13:31 - 13:34)
characters I sincerely hope trainers who (13:33 - 13:36)
embark on this journey will find the (13:34 - 13:38)
same excitement and joy uh they (13:36 - 13:39)
experience when they encountered their (13:38 - 13:41)
first Pokemon (13:39 - 13:44)
players can use their current save data (13:41 - 13:46)
from Pokemon scarlet and violet to (13:44 - 13:48)
continue their Adventure uh I'm just (13:46 - 13:49)
gonna say the DLC because the hidden (13:48 - 13:51)
treasure of error zero is a mouthful (13:49 - 13:52)
it's really long (13:51 - 13:54)
um it's a hot take it's kind of a bad (13:52 - 13:56)
name just (13:54 - 13:59)
wow like the teal mask is short sweet (13:56 - 14:02)
Indigo disc short sweet uh (13:59 - 14:05)

jointly between the academy and another (14:46 - 14:51)
school in part two the Indigo disc (14:48 - 14:52)
players will be traveling to the (14:51 - 14:55)
blueberry Academy a sister School of (14:52 - 14:58)
their own Academy as exchange students (14:55 - 14:59)
while this tale is split into two parts (14:58 - 15:02)
they link together to tell a connected (14:59 - 15:03)
story (15:02 - 15:04)
uh so I think the takeaway there that (15:03 - 15:07)
Hannah mentioned a bit earlier is there (15:04 - 15:10)
was no connection between the Isle of (15:07 - 15:11)
armor (15:10 - 15:13)
and the crown Tundra (15:11 - 15:16)
not that I remember at least correct me (15:13 - 15:20)
if I'm wrong yeah not really no (15:16 - 15:23)
nothing at all (15:20 - 15:23)
but in this case (15:24 - 15:29)
it sounds like there might be (15:26 - 15:33)
yeah I I think somebody mentioned this (15:29 - 15:36)
um during my live stream uh but when you (15:33 - 15:39)
take the Elite Four quiz and that she (15:36 - 15:41)
she asks what school you're from one of (15:39 - 15:43)
the answers is blueberry I believe yep (15:41 - 15:46)
it is (15:43 - 15:46)
for some reason not translated into (15:46 - 15:49)
Spanish (15:48 - 15:51)
but it's there (15:49 - 15:51)
it's blue and blueberry in Spanish it's (15:52 - 15:57)
not just blueberry right it has to be (15:55 - 16:01)
yeah no it's a different word okay it's (15:57 - 16:06)
I I my Spanish pronunciation is bad it's (16:01 - 16:06)
learning Japanese ruined my Spanish (16:07 - 16:10)
pronunciation okay (16:08 - 16:12)
[Laughter] (16:10 - 16:15)
uh (16:12 - 16:15)
in the trailer I think I think the (16:16 - 16:22)
theming of uh kitsakami is is very (16:19 - 16:24)
obvious and I want to go more into that (16:22 - 16:25)
but in the trail of the Indigo disc (16:24 - 16:30)
looks like it's an underwater school yes (16:25 - 16:33)
that's what it says yeah I'm very much (16:30 - 16:35)
into that (16:33 - 16:37)
there's one thing I've been diving into (16:35 - 16:40)
a lot of the lore hypotheses that people (16:37 - 16:42)
are having around these games because (16:40 - 16:44)
the lore interests me and one thing that (16:42 - 16:47)
people have pointed out is that the um (16:44 - 16:48)
the (16:47 - 16:50)
behind the scenes name for these games (16:48 - 16:52)
well they were in development was (16:50 - 16:53)
Atlantis (16:52 - 16:57)
and I'm very curious if this blueberry (16:53 - 17:00)
school plays into that being an (16:57 - 17:03)
underwater school and all of that (17:00 - 17:03)
yeah like I mean there are like what 400 (17:03 - 17:09)
fish Pokemon instead of violet as well (17:07 - 17:12)
right so finally I can see Finney on (17:09 - 17:14)
close up underwater (17:12 - 17:15)
that's what I've been waiting for all (17:14 - 17:18)
right here we go in part one the teal (17:15 - 17:20)
mask players will choose uh players will (17:18 - 17:22)
be chosen to take part in a school trip (17:20 - 17:24)
that is held each year in collaboration (17:22 - 17:25)
with another school (17:24 - 17:27)
they will be taken to the land of (17:25 - 17:29)
kitakami where great mountains Tower (17:27 - 17:31)
over the land I'm sorry there's a lot of (17:29 - 17:32)
repeating it's a press release what do (17:31 - 17:35)
you put that's the nature of them in the (17:32 - 17:36)
land of Kid Academy where there are (17:35 - 17:38)
great mountains towering over land and (17:36 - 17:41)
people who live at its base it's a place (17:38 - 17:42)
of tranquil natural black and white (17:41 - 17:45)
confirmed tranquil uh natural expanses (17:42 - 17:47)
featuring rice paddies and apple (17:45 - 17:48)
orchards (17:47 - 17:51)
the trip seems to coincide with a (17:48 - 17:52)
Festival held regularly in the village (17:51 - 17:55)
in kitakami during the season so the (17:52 - 17:58)
village is busy bustling with or they (17:55 - 18:00)
could be busting uh with various streets (17:58 - 18:02)
vendors and stalls players will meet new (18:00 - 18:04)
friends and Pokemon as they unravel (18:02 - 18:06)
mystery behind the folk tales that have (18:04 - 18:09)
been passed down in the land (18:06 - 18:11)
okay first question here so they're (18:09 - 18:12)
talking about the fact that we're (18:11 - 18:15)
leaving the paldea region right (18:12 - 18:18)
so are we thinking that this is like a (18:15 - 18:22)
different region entirely that's what it (18:18 - 18:24)
sounds like a new region isn't this just (18:22 - 18:26)
like (18:24 - 18:28)
I love armor it was just an island we (18:26 - 18:30)
went to yeah but it was still in Galler (18:28 - 18:33)
yeah they make a point to say that (18:30 - 18:36)
you're leaving the paldeo region I mean (18:33 - 18:39)
is this place yeah I I I I isn't (18:36 - 18:41)
something like (18:39 - 18:43)
gosh I read somewhere there was so much (18:41 - 18:45)
on Twitter and social media today that (18:43 - 18:46)
like (18:45 - 18:48)
and I've I've been running like three (18:46 - 18:50)
hours of sleep I read something where (18:48 - 18:51)
everything pointed that this would be (18:50 - 18:54)
north of paldea (18:51 - 18:56)
so I don't know if that's North on an (18:54 - 18:58)
island I don't know if that's in that (18:56 - 19:00)
little grayed out area where everyone (18:58 - 19:03)
thought kallus was (19:00 - 19:03)
um I don't know if it's (19:03 - 19:08)
in paldea but it's just the thing that (19:06 - 19:10)
Galler did which was just like (19:08 - 19:14)
pick up and fly over to yeah uh the (19:10 - 19:16)
crown not the crown Thunder sorry the (19:14 - 19:18)
um the Isle of armor I feel like they I (19:16 - 19:19)
just feel like they wouldn't have made (19:18 - 19:21)
it a point to say we were leaving paldea (19:19 - 19:23)
I agree yeah (19:21 - 19:26)
it's a completely different region and (19:23 - 19:29)
it feels much closer to the first few (19:26 - 19:31)
Japan themed regions (19:29 - 19:34)
from the first few Generations Kanto (19:31 - 19:35)
coming back well you think we're going (19:34 - 19:36)
like (19:35 - 19:39)
all the way over all the way over well (19:36 - 19:40)
this is a very (19:39 - 19:41)
um (19:40 - 19:43)
Japanese thing (19:41 - 19:45)
like culturally (19:43 - 19:48)
uh every second of that trailer yes a (19:45 - 19:52)
million percent so even down to like the (19:48 - 19:56)
folklore is very Yokai Yokai uh based I (19:52 - 19:57)
almost said Yokai Watch Yokai watches (19:56 - 20:00)
like you okay uh (19:57 - 20:04)
but like I got I I think thematically (20:00 - 20:06)
in a million years I would have never (20:04 - 20:07)
asked for this right like I would have (20:06 - 20:09)
never been like well somebody would be (20:07 - 20:10)
like Steve where do you want to go in a (20:09 - 20:12)
Pokemon game and I would be like I don't (20:10 - 20:13)
know like Australia because we've never (20:12 - 20:15)
been there uh died the Egypt because (20:13 - 20:17)
pyramids like I couldn't think of a (20:15 - 20:19)
place but if somebody was like well we (20:17 - 20:22)
want to go to a Japanese Forest during a (20:19 - 20:24)
Summer Festival with fireworks and we're (20:22 - 20:25)
going to focus on this kind of folklore (20:24 - 20:28)
and there's going to be like stands of (20:25 - 20:30)
like food and like all of like people (20:28 - 20:33)
coming out like thematically that is so (20:30 - 20:36)
interesting to me I'm so into it like I (20:33 - 20:38)
want to book a trip to Japan right now I (20:36 - 20:40)
know it's not summer but like point me (20:38 - 20:41)
to the direction of a forest with (20:40 - 20:45)
fireworks I want to be there (20:41 - 20:45)
I mean Pokemon worlds is coming up yeah (20:45 - 20:50)
there's your chance (20:48 - 20:53)
but I don't know to me this felt more (20:50 - 20:55)
like a filler episode (20:53 - 20:57)
and that's that's the feeling I got from (20:55 - 21:00)
it I wasn't as excited about it because (20:57 - 21:02)
I was like Hannah's gonna come on the (21:00 - 21:04)
show she's gonna be like this is tight (21:02 - 21:06)
this is what I want I think it's (21:04 - 21:07)
beautiful don't get me wrong on that I (21:06 - 21:09)
think it's beautiful I think it's neat (21:07 - 21:11)
but I'm really invested in the story (21:09 - 21:14)
that we've been learning about in paldea (21:11 - 21:16)
and this has seemed completely divorced (21:14 - 21:17)
from that (21:16 - 21:19)
yeah that's a good point (21:17 - 21:21)
according to the press release it might (21:19 - 21:24)
not be completely separate from it but (21:21 - 21:25)
what we've been given out of the press (21:24 - 21:29)
release so far I'm not seeing any hints (21:25 - 21:31)
of anything from paldea there other than (21:29 - 21:33)
the name of the hidden treasure of area (21:31 - 21:36)
zero (21:33 - 21:36)
um (21:36 - 21:39)
okay there are new Pokemon we'll get to (21:37 - 21:39)
that I just want to finish this press (21:39 - 21:42)
release we got one more paragraph here (21:39 - 21:44)
now it does now I did say in part one (21:42 - 21:46)
the teal mask will take players to a (21:44 - 21:47)
school there is no (21:46 - 21:50)
in part two uh at least in the press (21:47 - 21:51)
release they don't (21:50 - 21:53)
go into (21:51 - 21:57)
part two which was very similar honestly (21:53 - 21:59)
with the marketing of (21:57 - 22:00)
from what I remember the DLC of sword (21:59 - 22:02)
and shield they like really went in on (22:00 - 22:03)
the Isle of armor and they were like (22:02 - 22:04)
we're not going to tell you anything (22:03 - 22:06)
about the crown Tundra (22:04 - 22:07)
um (22:06 - 22:09)
but trailer for The Crown Tundra was (22:07 - 22:11)
released it was a big deal because we (22:09 - 22:14)
knew nothing about it yeah right yep uh (22:11 - 22:16)
so it says in part one the teal mask and (22:14 - 22:18)
in part two the Indigo disc players will (22:16 - 22:21)
be able to encounter 200 over 230 so (22:18 - 22:24)
that means like 231 over 231 familiar (22:21 - 22:27)
Pokemon that have been living in other (22:24 - 22:29)
regions but not have appeared in Pokemon (22:27 - 22:32)
scarlet and violet uh your boy dugong is (22:29 - 22:34)
back to the four people out there that (22:32 - 22:37)
was like man I miss dugong he's here (22:34 - 22:39)
he's coming back also Carmen is coming (22:37 - 22:40)
back that's actually probably the most (22:39 - 22:42)
exciting one on the list (22:40 - 22:44)
um uh this includes Pokemon that players (22:42 - 22:47)
will be able to bring to their games via (22:44 - 22:48)
Pokemon home or those are received in (22:47 - 22:50)
trades players will encounter new (22:48 - 22:53)
legendary Pokemon ogre Pawn in part one (22:50 - 22:56)
the teal mask and terapogos I probably (22:53 - 22:59)
said that wrong in part two the Indigo (22:56 - 23:01)
disc in part one the teal mask three (22:59 - 23:05)
Pokemon named Okie doggy monkey Dory and (23:01 - 23:08)
uh (23:05 - 23:08)
yeah I had to think about that one (23:09 - 23:15)
because it's pheasant and Serendipity (23:12 - 23:17)
Serendipity (23:15 - 23:19)
um these Pokemon are incredible I'm (23:17 - 23:20)
instantly in love with all three of them (23:19 - 23:22)
I'm just gonna say that (23:20 - 23:23)
um (23:22 - 23:24)
they are beloved by the people of the (23:23 - 23:26)
village they're beloved by me and the (23:24 - 23:30)
people of the village uh as Heroes they (23:26 - 23:32)
protect the land of kitakami in the past (23:30 - 23:33)
stone statues were made in their (23:32 - 23:35)
likeness to express people's gratitude (23:33 - 23:38)
players who purchase the hidden treasure (23:35 - 23:41)
of area Zero by October 31st well here's (23:38 - 23:42)
another thing to put in the calendar you (23:41 - 23:45)

already did this I tested it I paid with (24:15 - 24:18)
my own money (24:17 - 24:20)
um when you go to the eShop it gives you (24:18 - 24:21)
the code right when you (24:20 - 24:23)
are done (24:21 - 24:25)
that you get mystery gift if you somehow (24:23 - 24:28)
X out of that or don't screenshot it (24:25 - 24:31)
um it emails you the code as well so (24:28 - 24:33)
uh (24:31 - 24:36)
that is uh that's the press release (24:33 - 24:40)
there's more stuff on the website but (24:36 - 24:40)
uh I was wondering about since we were (24:40 - 24:45)
just uh just noticed what they were (24:43 - 24:46)
saying about (24:45 - 24:46)
um (24:46 - 24:49)
uh that they protected the land of (24:46 - 24:51)
kitakami in the past and then they were (24:49 - 24:54)
talking about how it's the that story is (24:51 - 24:56)
about traditional (24:54 - 24:58)
things passed down and all of that just (24:56 - 25:01)
gives me that very like Scarlet past (24:58 - 25:05)
feel and then uh School in the middle of (25:01 - 25:07)
the ocean underwater gives me a very (25:05 - 25:09)
future Violet feel I didn't think about (25:07 - 25:12)
it yeah I can see that (25:09 - 25:14)
so I wonder if (25:12 - 25:15)
if there's going to play on that at all (25:14 - 25:18)
it kind of feels like they could I mean (25:15 - 25:20)
straight up there's not going to be well (25:18 - 25:23)
other than the fact that Atlantis was a (25:20 - 25:25)
historical thing but um it just just (25:23 - 25:27)
from that trailer the the school and (25:25 - 25:29)
everything that for the little bit that (25:27 - 25:31)
they showed definitely seemed more (25:29 - 25:34)
futuristic more modern uh (25:31 - 25:38)
than the other part also uh that Pokemon (25:34 - 25:41)
what was his name tarapagos I'm assuming (25:38 - 25:43)
like Galapagos and yeah (25:41 - 25:47)
right that's a place right yeah yes it (25:43 - 25:48)
is (25:47 - 25:50)
um is (25:48 - 25:52)
definitely my favorite Pokemon in this (25:50 - 25:54)
region at this point that Pokemon is (25:52 - 25:57)
awesome it is surprisingly cute it is (25:54 - 26:00)
it's really great I love it (25:57 - 26:02)
I I want you know those doors that have (26:00 - 26:05)
one window just in the middle and it's a (26:02 - 26:07)
round window I want to have a door with (26:05 - 26:10)
a window that is based off of its shell (26:07 - 26:12)
oh that yeah yeah (26:10 - 26:14)
and then you want all the Terra symbols (26:12 - 26:17)
in the window yes (26:14 - 26:17)
but if they add like a new type what (26:17 - 26:21)
they had sound type in the future then (26:19 - 26:23)
the turtles then the turtle's useless (26:21 - 26:25)
yep you can't you can't do it all that's (26:23 - 26:27)
the big thing with this Pokemon it feels (26:25 - 26:29)
like they're kind of setting it in Stone (26:27 - 26:31)
from here on and that's kind of (26:29 - 26:33)
kind of scary (26:31 - 26:35)
just a little bit (26:33 - 26:38)
um okay so off off the website (26:35 - 26:40)
um it says the teal mask step out of the (26:38 - 26:43)
paldera region as you take a trip to the (26:40 - 26:44)
land of kitakami you will meet new (26:43 - 26:47)
people and Pokemon while unraveling the (26:44 - 26:50)
mystery of an area's folk tale (26:47 - 26:52)
um the teal mask is stated for fall and (26:50 - 26:54)
then Indigo disc we do get a little bit (26:52 - 26:57)
more info here the story continues uh as (26:54 - 26:59)
you become an exchange student in the (26:57 - 27:02)
blueberry Academy most of the school is (26:59 - 27:04)
located under the ocean (27:02 - 27:07)
and the curriculum emphasizes Pokemon (27:04 - 27:08)
battling (27:07 - 27:11)
and that is stated for winter of 2023. (27:08 - 27:13)
they're finally going to teach us how to (27:11 - 27:15)
do raids and Pokemon finally no they're (27:13 - 27:17)
not (27:15 - 27:17)
it gives off a very battle tower vibe (27:17 - 27:25)
yeah I wonder if this is uh flipped uh (27:21 - 27:28)
because they they have enough (27:25 - 27:30)
for (27:28 - 27:31)
so (27:30 - 27:33)
I guess I'm speculating a lot and I (27:31 - 27:34)
apologize (27:33 - 27:36)
um but (27:34 - 27:39)
in most like third versions We we get (27:36 - 27:42)
everything that we're missing well we (27:39 - 27:43)
used to get everything now the National (27:42 - 27:45)
dex exists or who is cut so but (27:43 - 27:47)
legendary wise we do right so like at (27:45 - 27:48)
the end of (27:47 - 27:50)
um in Omega Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire (27:48 - 27:51)
all the Legends are there right they (27:50 - 27:54)
made a big deal about that (27:51 - 27:57)
um and there's no coincidence that Omega (27:54 - 27:58)
Ruby Alpha Sapphire sold incredibly well (27:57 - 28:01)
for a remake told very very well and (27:58 - 28:03)
then um in Ultra Sun Ultra Moon all the (28:01 - 28:05)
Legends are there and then in the crown (28:03 - 28:07)
Tundra for sword and shield so (28:05 - 28:09)
ultimately like three main Series games (28:07 - 28:13)
in a row uh that added all the Legends (28:09 - 28:17)
um and competitively wise uh competitive (28:13 - 28:19)
wise uh usually the final stages of (28:17 - 28:23)
competitive are legends right like (28:19 - 28:25)
Landorus is now available cresselli is (28:23 - 28:26)
now available Heatran is now available (28:25 - 28:29)
sashian like they nerfed zashian right (28:26 - 28:31)
like zashian's not in the game and (28:29 - 28:33)
before the game came out they nerfed it (28:31 - 28:35)
they nerfed how its ability works it (28:33 - 28:37)
does like 20 less damage I mean still an (28:35 - 28:39)
incredible amount of damage don't don't (28:37 - 28:41)
get me wrong sashin is still an (28:39 - 28:42)
incredible Pokemon (28:41 - 28:44)
so (28:42 - 28:47)
it it's almost safe to say that like all (28:44 - 28:48)
the Legends will come back in the second (28:47 - 28:52)
DLC and if that is Battle heavy it's (28:48 - 28:54)
it's almost like they flipped the Isle (28:52 - 28:56)
of armor in the crown Tundra like Isle (28:54 - 28:58)
of armor was pretty battle heavy (28:56 - 29:00)
um comparative to the crown Tundra which (28:58 - 29:04)
was more like story uh with the horses (29:00 - 29:06)
and then like here's raids that you can (29:04 - 29:08)
do oh and the story with the birds too (29:06 - 29:10)
right like there's the horses the birds (29:08 - 29:12)
I guess technically the Regis like they (29:10 - 29:14)
did all of these legendary stories and (29:12 - 29:17)
then the raids which isle of armor was (29:14 - 29:20)
here's urshifu an incredible like a (29:17 - 29:23)
Pokemon designed for competitive a (29:20 - 29:25)
Pokemon purely in the sense of like (29:23 - 29:27)
we're sick of people protecting or Shifu (29:25 - 29:29)
gets around that we're sick of people (29:27 - 29:30)
light screening and reflecting great (29:29 - 29:32)
it's move always crits it gets around (29:30 - 29:34)
that like it's such a menace (29:32 - 29:37)
competitively uh and both were very good (29:34 - 29:39)
and then on top of that I love armor was (29:37 - 29:41)
like here's the vending machines for (29:39 - 29:44)
carbos and iron and here's the mints and (29:41 - 29:47)
here's like that game is that that DLC (29:44 - 29:50)
is very competitive in the grand scheme (29:47 - 29:51)
of things (29:50 - 29:52)
um (29:51 - 29:54)
so I just wonder because they just (29:52 - 29:55)
mentioned (29:54 - 29:57)
the school emphasizes battling (29:55 - 30:00)
that to me like leans into what the Isle (29:57 - 30:04)
of armor was kind of trying to do (30:00 - 30:04)
a little bit (30:04 - 30:07)
a little battle tower stuff you know (30:05 - 30:09)
people like bell towers yeah I think (30:07 - 30:11)
it'll be much more connected to the (30:09 - 30:13)
story just based on (30:11 - 30:15)
uh (30:13 - 30:17)
the Pokemon I can't remember how to say (30:15 - 30:19)
its name (30:17 - 30:21)
yeah yeah just based on that it feels (30:19 - 30:23)
like it'll be very much (30:21 - 30:25)
connected to (30:23 - 30:27)
the story which (30:25 - 30:29)
Isle of armor (30:27 - 30:31)
kind of wasn't but that doesn't mean (30:29 - 30:32)
that they can't also I mean Isle of (30:31 - 30:34)
armor you learned that Master gosh what (30:32 - 30:36)
is his name mustard was the one that (30:34 - 30:40)
trained Leon yeah there is that (30:36 - 30:42)
story there was there's a little bit (30:40 - 30:42)
yeah (30:42 - 30:44)
sword and shield altogether didn't have (30:42 - 30:46)
that that strongest story to begin with (30:44 - 30:49)
that's what I'm talking about every (30:46 - 30:51)
question was answered I have recently (30:49 - 30:54)
gone back and watched videos summarizing (30:51 - 30:55)
the story because I had to go back and (30:54 - 30:58)
make sure that I didn't miss anything it (30:55 - 31:01)
makes so much sense no it still doesn't (30:58 - 31:03)
make sense why Leon's one of his traits (31:01 - 31:05)
is he just gets lost (31:03 - 31:08)
I mean he at least has a character trait (31:05 - 31:11)
yeah that's true that's true that's true (31:08 - 31:13)
uh speaking of getting lost before we (31:11 - 31:14)
talk about these new Pokemon let's take (31:13 - 31:17)
a quick break (31:14 - 31:19)
and when we come back or there's a bunch (31:17 - 31:21)
of new Pokemon to talk about and some (31:19 - 31:22)
other stuff in the trailer we haven't (31:21 - 31:23)
gone over (31:22 - 31:27)
um so we will be uh right back and we (31:23 - 31:31)
are back from our break (31:27 - 31:32)
I felt like no one was talking about (31:31 - 31:35)
this uh it's right on the website the (31:32 - 31:38)
expansion will bring over 230 familiar (31:35 - 31:40)
Pokemon that has not appeared in Pokemon (31:38 - 31:42)
scarlet and violet we see uh in the (31:40 - 31:46)
picture we see Milotic yanma uh vicavolt (31:42 - 31:49)
nine tails shiftery uh the chimecco line (31:46 - 31:52)
alchemies of strika I think a lot of (31:49 - 31:54)
people are excited for Zab strika uh (31:52 - 31:56)
esper Metagross whimsicott and (31:54 - 31:58)
everyone's favorite (31:56 - 32:01)
dugong uh okay you know what that is (31:58 - 32:02)
actually one of my son's favorite (32:01 - 32:04)
Pokemon (32:02 - 32:07)
don't talk too badly about it then no I (32:04 - 32:09)
don't even think he knew what dugong was (32:07 - 32:11)
like a week ago but I had some stickers (32:09 - 32:13)
from uh (32:11 - 32:15)
Mewtwo Strikes Back the the new one (32:13 - 32:17)
Evolution whatever it was called Mewtwo (32:15 - 32:18)
Strikes Back Evolution or something like (32:17 - 32:21)
that uh and he saw it he was like oh (32:18 - 32:23)
what's this Pokemon I was like that's (32:21 - 32:26)
dugong he was like yes (32:23 - 32:28)
all of a sudden all right that's cool (32:26 - 32:30)
that's cool I mean his favorite Pokemon (32:28 - 32:33)
is popplio so he likes oh interesting (32:30 - 32:36)
interesting Lions yeah little style of (32:33 - 32:37)
we actually have a lot of seals like 20 (32:36 - 32:38)
minutes away from us that you can go (32:37 - 32:40)
check out all the time do you think if (32:38 - 32:42)
you tell your son about the Japanese (32:40 - 32:44)
people being upset that dugong was in (32:42 - 32:47)
the trailer that advertised for sword (32:44 - 32:49)
and shield and they then they got mad (32:47 - 32:51)
that it was false advertising do you (32:49 - 32:53)
think your son would be like yeah false (32:51 - 32:56)
advertising I love dugong he'd be like (32:53 - 32:59)
what's advertising (32:56 - 33:02)
well we live in America (32:59 - 33:04)
not pretty easily yeah I see everything (33:02 - 33:06)
that's out there that's advertising (33:04 - 33:09)
[Laughter] (33:06 - 33:14)
um yeah so 230 Pokemon uh I think (33:09 - 33:15)
legendaries (33:14 - 33:18)
take up about 60 of that assuming (33:15 - 33:20)
legendaries are coming back that's like (33:18 - 33:24)
a big chunk of Pokemon uh that was (33:20 - 33:28)
par personal reason why I didn't love (33:24 - 33:29)
Crown Tundra as much of Isle of armor is (33:28 - 33:32)
like it was so legendary heavy that that (33:29 - 33:34)
was that links to the Pokemon that were (33:32 - 33:36)
in there right (33:34 - 33:39)
whereas Isle of armor felt like so many (33:36 - 33:41)
new Pokemon as you were like going (33:39 - 33:42)
through the swamps and the water and the (33:41 - 33:44)
forest and then Crown Thunder was like (33:42 - 33:47)
oh yeah you saw you saw you already like (33:44 - 33:49)
good to see you again (33:47 - 33:51)
I'm just gonna say it I love armor (33:49 - 33:55)
better than crown dundra (33:51 - 33:58)
very debatable I liked it more (33:55 - 34:01)
but I don't that's not the opinion I (33:58 - 34:04)
normally hear yeah I know I know the (34:01 - 34:07)
crown Tundra brings people back yeah (34:04 - 34:12)
uh so 230 Pokemon that now the to be (34:07 - 34:14)
fair they're saying 230 familiar Pokemon (34:12 - 34:16)
we have no clue how many new Pokemon (34:14 - 34:19)
there are going to be we saw a handful (34:16 - 34:21)
of new Pokemon today uh they started off (34:19 - 34:22)
with (34:21 - 34:27)
um you know the uh two legends I think (34:22 - 34:29)
they're they called them Legends of the (34:27 - 34:31)
turtle and then gosh what what is the (34:29 - 34:34)
Majora's Mask Skull Kid I can't what was (34:32 - 34:37)
their name ogre oh the ogre yeah oh (34:34 - 34:40)
something fun ogre pod (34:37 - 34:44)
I think no I don't think that's it I (34:40 - 34:46)
think that was it no it is (34:44 - 34:49)
why did I think there was an m in there (34:46 - 34:51)
okay never mind (34:49 - 34:54)
yes that's where it's at that's (34:51 - 34:56)
yes they do say legendary Pokemon let's (34:54 - 34:59)
the new legendary Pokemon ogre pawn and (34:56 - 35:01)
then (34:59 - 35:01)
terrestrialization I can't say that word (35:02 - 35:07)
you already lost me there you can say (35:05 - 35:09)
Tara types so Tara like Tara types Sarah (35:07 - 35:10)
and then (35:09 - 35:13)
pogos like Galapagos like Galapagos yeah (35:10 - 35:17)
I don't even know where the Galapagos (35:13 - 35:17)
[Laughter] (35:17 - 35:23)
those things are hot they're not (35:21 - 35:26)
connected (35:23 - 35:26)
breathe breathe we'll get through this (35:28 - 35:31)
episode (35:30 - 35:34)
uh okay (35:31 - 35:34)
we'll talk about those in a second (35:35 - 35:43)
Okie doggy monkey Dory (35:38 - 35:43)
there's such good Pokemon they are (35:47 - 35:55)
their names are great (35:53 - 35:58)
I'm interested in what seems to be their (35:55 - 35:59)
alternate forms (35:58 - 36:01)
which is the masks that you can see in (35:59 - 36:02)
the trailer (36:01 - 36:05)
yeah yeah there's there there's there's (36:02 - 36:09)
for sure that that also scream folklore (36:05 - 36:12)
they do scream very much like the the (36:09 - 36:14)
folklore themes that they are reaching (36:12 - 36:17)
for in this in this DLC and I'm I'm here (36:14 - 36:18)
for it (36:17 - 36:21)
uh (36:18 - 36:21)
uh I I can't get over how good they are (36:22 - 36:27)
they're so good (36:24 - 36:27)
but I guess we don't know if they're (36:27 - 36:32)
legendary usually a trio of new Pokemon (36:28 - 36:35)
is a Legendary Trio (36:32 - 36:38)
I've never been ever been a trio that (36:35 - 36:41)
isn't legendary when they're (36:38 - 36:44)
yeah on Flareon is the first one that (36:41 - 36:46)
comes to mind (36:44 - 36:49)
I'd call those legendary myself but but (36:46 - 36:52)
I would I would I would put so going (36:49 - 36:54)
back to competitive stuff right like you (36:52 - 36:56)
have box Legends (36:54 - 36:58)
um that are normally banned and then you (36:56 - 37:00)
have the sub Legends which for an (36:58 - 37:02)
average Pokemon player you wouldn't (37:00 - 37:03)
really know that right because that's (37:02 - 37:05)
like the coding stuff but like usually (37:03 - 37:08)
all sub Legends are are allowed uh once (37:05 - 37:10)
Legends are allowed in (37:08 - 37:11)
um and just because the Pokemon's (37:10 - 37:13)
legendary doesn't mean it's particularly (37:11 - 37:14)
good like you can look at like savalley (37:13 - 37:17)
is naturally like a pretty bad legendary (37:14 - 37:19)
competitive Pokemon (37:17 - 37:20)
um but it would be it would make sense (37:19 - 37:22)
that these are legends in a way (37:20 - 37:25)
comparable to like Articuno zepto small (37:22 - 37:28)
trace or ryko anti-suicoon and (37:25 - 37:32)
but to wrap up the turtle (37:28 - 37:35)
um and uh ogrepon would be on the level (37:32 - 37:39)
of a Kyogre or a Groudon or a calorex (37:35 - 37:43)
uh or azashian where they're not allowed (37:39 - 37:45)
in this format because they're not (37:43 - 37:48)
because they're technically box Legends (37:45 - 37:51)
and if they were to be allowed you're (37:48 - 37:52)
usually the rules are you're only (37:51 - 37:55)
allowed two box Legends so that's why in (37:52 - 37:57)
the end of scarlet and violet the (37:55 - 38:00)
winning team ended up being Kyogre (37:57 - 38:02)
zashian now there could have been other (38:00 - 38:04)
Legends on the team but Cairo grazashian (38:02 - 38:06)
were the two box Legends (38:04 - 38:08)
um (38:06 - 38:12)
my only worry is ogrepon is grass dark (38:08 - 38:15)
and I hope it's not because grass dark (38:12 - 38:16)
is one of the worst typings ever (38:15 - 38:19)
[Laughter] (38:16 - 38:21)
ouch (38:19 - 38:21)
it's come in handy for some Pokemon here (38:22 - 38:26)
and there and with terrestrialization (38:24 - 38:28)
it's not as bad sure that's true that's (38:26 - 38:33)
very true I I don't care about ogre Pawn (38:28 - 38:35)
at this point maybe that will change (38:33 - 38:37)
when I see it in motion or I I see (38:35 - 38:40)
what's happening some piece of artwork I (38:37 - 38:42)
think from the press release that looked (38:40 - 38:44)
a little better it's also on the (38:42 - 38:46)
official website the (38:44 - 38:48)
the piece of art they showed in the (38:46 - 38:49)
trailer (38:48 - 38:53)
was kind of off center and confusing to (38:49 - 38:55)
look at (38:53 - 38:57)
the one that's on the website actually (38:55 - 39:01)
you can tell looks more like a Pokemon (38:57 - 39:03)
yeah I mean clearly there's something to (39:01 - 39:05)
do with its mask (39:03 - 39:06)
um I'm curious if it can put on (39:05 - 39:08)
different masks (39:06 - 39:10)
um kind of like how Genesect can put in (39:08 - 39:12)
different drives I don't know if people (39:10 - 39:14)
know this about Genesect that there (39:12 - 39:15)
there are different drives you can put (39:14 - 39:18)
into it uh so valai and Arceus obviously (39:15 - 39:19)
there's different discs you can put in (39:18 - 39:21)
Kyogre Groudon (39:19 - 39:24)
um they have different orbs (39:21 - 39:24)
I guess technically so it wouldn't be it (39:25 - 39:30)
wouldn't surprise me if the thing with (39:27 - 39:33)
the mask which gives Majora's Max Vibes (39:30 - 39:36)
has multiple masks (39:33 - 39:38)
um especially because that trailer opens (39:36 - 39:41)
up with masks you see a variety of masks (39:38 - 39:44)
hanging on the (39:41 - 39:45)
um which again is another part of those (39:44 - 39:48)
festivals of you know masks balloons (39:45 - 39:51)
food fireworks that kind of stuff again (39:48 - 39:53)
thematically (39:51 - 39:55)
to killing it seems like thematically (39:53 - 39:58)
seems great yeah dramatically it is very (39:55 - 40:01)
tied together on its own (39:58 - 40:01)
I'll keep saying that I'll keep saying (40:03 - 40:06)
that until they prove that it's (40:05 - 40:08)
connected to anything else (40:06 - 40:11)
but we but Hannah you think the uh (40:08 - 40:14)
uh you think these three folklore mons (40:11 - 40:16)
are changing they're they're gonna look (40:14 - 40:18)
like something else (40:16 - 40:20)
well the masks that you're are are (40:18 - 40:22)
referring to from the beginning of the (40:20 - 40:24)
trailer did not look like them but they (40:22 - 40:28)
were also clearly a dog a monkey and a (40:24 - 40:31)
bird mask yes so I'm pretty certain (40:28 - 40:33)
those are all the same Pokemon it seems (40:31 - 40:34)
like the (40:33 - 40:37)
three Trio of Pokemon that we have here (40:34 - 40:39)
are gonna transform into something a (40:37 - 40:42)
little bit more superhero-y at least is (40:39 - 40:45)
what the masks look like (40:42 - 40:49)
little Power Rangers up in there yep (40:45 - 40:52)
Little Tommy Little Jason I don't (40:49 - 40:54)
remember any other part Power Ranger (40:52 - 40:58)
names Tommy Jason Billy Billy oh yeah (40:54 - 41:01)
Billy Zach and Trini right (40:58 - 41:04)
Trini you actually have them down wow (41:01 - 41:06)
Power Rangers oh I loved the Power (41:04 - 41:08)
Rangers (41:06 - 41:08)
uh speaking of things that didn't look (41:08 - 41:13)
exactly (41:11 - 41:15)
like we were told (41:13 - 41:16)
um we talked about this a couple (41:15 - 41:20)
episodes ago uh that there was (41:16 - 41:22)
um legendary Pokemon that were paradoxed (41:20 - 41:25)
uh I didn't really consider that a (41:22 - 41:26)
spoiler even though it was leaked very (41:25 - 41:28)
early on but (41:26 - 41:30)
um you can walk into the school and you (41:28 - 41:31)
can find those books and you can see (41:30 - 41:33)
those pictures uh whether or not people (41:31 - 41:34)
did that (41:33 - 41:36)
up to you (41:34 - 41:39)
um but if you did do that if you did see (41:36 - 41:40)
those pictures or whether that was (41:39 - 41:42)
online on Twitter or in the game in the (41:40 - 41:45)
books you saw what looked like (41:42 - 41:46)
um (41:45 - 41:50)
a suicune and maybe an Entei and maybe a (41:46 - 41:52)
riko all kind of in like this Beast form (41:50 - 41:56)
uh and obviously that was uh the ancient (41:52 - 41:59)
form for Violet and then the other book (41:56 - 42:01)
Scarlet thank you and then the other (41:59 - 42:02)
book page had (42:01 - 42:05)
um what looked to be Verizon but with a (42:02 - 42:06)
little bit of cobalian and a little bit (42:05 - 42:09)
of Terrakion and that was the Violet and (42:06 - 42:11)
that looked to be the future (42:09 - 42:14)
and so it was obvious that like okay (42:11 - 42:16)
when are these Pokemon going to show up (42:14 - 42:17)
are they going to show up in the DLC (42:16 - 42:19)
they showed up today uh in five star (42:17 - 42:23)
raids so they level 75 not too tough um (42:19 - 42:24)
it's just you know people not under you (42:23 - 42:25)
know just people being like oh these are (42:24 - 42:26)
new Pokemon I'm not sure whether it's (42:25 - 42:27)
types are I'm not sure what its moves (42:26 - 42:28)
are right (42:27 - 42:30)
you know and once people take a day or (42:28 - 42:32)
two to figure that out it'll be fine so (42:30 - 42:34)
you only catch one they're in the game (42:32 - 42:35)
today (42:34 - 42:36)
um they don't have Pokedex numbers yet (42:35 - 42:39)
this is very very similar to uh when (42:36 - 42:42)
Slowpoke appeared in the sword and (42:39 - 42:44)
shield I would say this is a little more (42:42 - 42:45)
exciting than a Slowpoke but you know (42:44 - 42:47)
made some Slowpoke fan out there maybe (42:45 - 42:50)
over the moon (42:47 - 42:52)
uh that being said (42:50 - 42:55)
these Pokemon don't look like what they (42:52 - 42:58)
were drawn as in the book yeah they were (42:55 - 43:00)
not the same Pokemon they're very (42:58 - 43:01)
different (43:00 - 43:05)
um but to make a point neither do the (43:01 - 43:08)
great Tusk and the Violet one (43:05 - 43:11)
those drawings are also different from (43:08 - 43:13)
the ultimate Pokemon that they turned (43:11 - 43:16)
out to be not as different there aren't (43:13 - 43:17)
as big changes that we can point out but (43:16 - 43:19)
the drawings are different from the (43:17 - 43:20)
actual Pokemon (43:19 - 43:23)
which means there's something going on (43:20 - 43:26)
there especially with these ones that we (43:23 - 43:30)
just got could it just be people like (43:26 - 43:32)
aren't great at (43:30 - 43:35)
or drawing what they saw well I mean (43:32 - 43:37)
yeah what was it you know like these (43:35 - 43:40)
books are coming from like these (43:37 - 43:41)
drawings and things are from the future (43:40 - 43:45)
and from the past technically right so (43:41 - 43:47)
right (43:45 - 43:49)
the interesting thing (43:47 - 43:51)
um and I I mean I I can't speak to this (43:49 - 43:53)
because I haven't Dove down that lower (43:51 - 43:55)
hole (43:53 - 44:00)
uh deep enough but there is conflicts in (43:55 - 44:03)
the from from what I remember and I'm (44:00 - 44:04)
super sorry I'm sure somebody on YouTube (44:03 - 44:07)
or in slack or in Discord they'll have (44:04 - 44:09)
like the paragraph of of what it what (44:07 - 44:11)
I'm going to say and be slightly wrong (44:09 - 44:14)
off but somewhere in the game it it kind (44:11 - 44:16)
of points out that the person who wrote (44:14 - 44:19)
about iron Tusk or iron Treads or gray (44:16 - 44:21)
Tusk they wrote about it before the time (44:19 - 44:24)
machine yes I was even there Arvin (44:21 - 44:26)
mentions that after you complete the (44:24 - 44:28)
main storyline and finish battling in (44:26 - 44:30)
the tournament (44:28 - 44:32)
oh it's after the tournament yeah okay (44:30 - 44:34)
that's what that's wonderful because (44:32 - 44:35)
when I was doing tournament I was (44:34 - 44:37)
skipping through dialogue because I was (44:35 - 44:38)
like I need I need six star raids now (44:37 - 44:40)
yeah it's right after that or at least (44:38 - 44:42)
it was for me it could also (44:40 - 44:44)
potentially be just after you've (44:42 - 44:46)
progressed through all of their (44:44 - 44:48)
friendship levels because it's the end (44:46 - 44:50)
of arvin's story that Arvin is standing (44:48 - 44:52)
there by the Scarlet book or the Violet (44:50 - 44:54)
book and you go up to him and he makes (44:52 - 44:56)
this comment of you know this doesn't (44:54 - 44:58)
really make sense (44:56 - 45:02)
that my parent was inspired by this book (44:58 - 45:05)
but the things in this book came from (45:02 - 45:08)
the machine that my parent made (45:05 - 45:08)
and so there's there's a disconnect (45:08 - 45:13)
there there's something happening that's (45:10 - 45:15)
what I'm very curious about (45:13 - 45:19)
but the trio legendaries that are in (45:15 - 45:21)
there also (45:19 - 45:25)
in particular the suicune Entei raiku (45:21 - 45:27)
one (45:25 - 45:29)
just especially didn't make sense (45:27 - 45:33)
because suicune Entei and raiku were (45:29 - 45:38)
reincarnated by Ho-Oh 250 years ago (45:33 - 45:41)
250-ish years ago (45:38 - 45:44)
so them being all smashed into one (45:41 - 45:47)
combined form however long ago (45:44 - 45:49)
doesn't quite make sense (45:47 - 45:52)
yeah and the the (45:49 - 45:56)
the picture that you see in the game is (45:52 - 46:01)
a beast on four legs with one tail and (45:56 - 46:03)
like yes it has the suicune crown and (46:01 - 46:06)
yes it has a huge mane and yes walking (46:03 - 46:11)
wake which is the suicune Pokemon is on (46:06 - 46:14)
two legs with tiny arms and it does have (46:11 - 46:17)
a huge mane but it is not nearly the (46:14 - 46:19)
same main as what's in the picture and (46:17 - 46:22)
it has two tails like a chimera it's (46:19 - 46:24)
like the virusian one you'd be like ah (46:22 - 46:26)
yeah the the artist you know maybe saw (46:24 - 46:28)
him slightly and like didn't get it all (46:26 - 46:29)
in (46:28 - 46:31)
um even though like again side by side (46:29 - 46:33)
like the the drawing is like thick legs (46:31 - 46:36)
thick antlers and (46:33 - 46:40)
it to me it always looked as all three (46:36 - 46:42)
of them (46:40 - 46:46)
for each Trio squished together (46:42 - 46:48)
and this is clearly just sweet [ __ ] and (46:46 - 46:50)
this is clearly just for rizzion (46:48 - 46:53)
yes and they look cool they look great (46:50 - 46:56)
they're just not what the picture has (46:53 - 46:57)
been for the last three months I think (46:56 - 47:00)
there's a question of whether (46:57 - 47:04)
the drawing came after (47:00 - 47:06)
no I'm not gonna say that right never (47:04 - 47:08)
mind I'm not gonna work that out even if (47:06 - 47:11)
it was like (47:08 - 47:13)
they never saw him or they made it up (47:11 - 47:16)
exactly no the book says that this is a (47:13 - 47:17)
theoretical picture (47:16 - 47:21)
it's one the book says I believe that (47:17 - 47:24)
these pictures are are Pokemon that (47:21 - 47:25)
could have been (47:24 - 47:28)
but not ones they necessarily saw it (47:25 - 47:29)
never even hints to them being Pokemon (47:28 - 47:31)
they necessarily saw whereas I think (47:29 - 47:34)
that it does for the other okay (47:31 - 47:37)
this gives me like Vibes of not in (47:34 - 47:39)
exactly the same way but like Legends (47:37 - 47:42)
Arceus where like these two groups know (47:39 - 47:44)
the great Sinnoh and they're see they (47:42 - 47:46)
see them differently and then and you (47:44 - 47:48)
know like how that all plays out that (47:46 - 47:51)
just feels very much like that (47:48 - 47:53)
like this is what we think this could (47:51 - 47:56)
look like this is what we and then I (47:53 - 47:57)
don't know those pictures having (47:56 - 47:59)
combination you're like oh okay we've (47:57 - 48:00)
narrowed it down to like a potential (47:59 - 48:03)
three Pokemon it kind of looks like and (48:00 - 48:04)
then they come out here and it's like oh (48:03 - 48:06)
it's one single Pokemon I don't know I (48:04 - 48:08)
I'm not saying there's not more like (48:06 - 48:11)
looking at the pictures yeah they're my (48:08 - 48:12)
they're very different from what we see (48:11 - 48:15)
what we're seeing today but it just (48:12 - 48:17)
feels very much like someone who (48:15 - 48:20)
was taking a guess at what these would (48:17 - 48:21)
look like and so they combined a bunch (48:20 - 48:24)
of stuff together and then what it (48:21 - 48:28)
actually looked like wasn't exactly like (48:24 - 48:29)
you know it's like they hyped up it's (48:28 - 48:31)
like they did what everybody they hyped (48:29 - 48:32)
up something and then when it came out I (48:31 - 48:34)
was like oh this isn't as awesome as we (48:32 - 48:35)
thought it was going to be when we all (48:34 - 48:38)
hyped it up ourselves (48:35 - 48:38)
I I think I think I struggle to (48:39 - 48:47)
um to talk anything in regards of (48:42 - 48:47)
ogrepon (48:47 - 48:52)
because even though he his mask has like (48:49 - 48:54)
a Tara thing on the top uh and he seems (48:52 - 48:56)
to be related to the the three folklore (48:54 - 48:57)
things (48:56 - 49:02)
it it does the existence of that not (48:57 - 49:04)
being in paldea like Hannah mentioned (49:02 - 49:07)
earlier still doesn't line up whereas if (49:04 - 49:08)
you look at the turtle (49:07 - 49:11)
it has every Terra thing on its back and (49:08 - 49:13)
it is clearly the thing that they were (49:11 - 49:15)
talking about that was blacked out in (49:13 - 49:18)
the book it's a disc it's covered in (49:15 - 49:19)
hexagons (49:18 - 49:22)
yes Tara his name starts with Tara like (49:19 - 49:26)
like the turtle is the thing causing the (49:22 - 49:28)
problem in area zero it's the thing (49:26 - 49:30)
eating the lab or something is causing (49:28 - 49:32)
it to the turtle is related to whatever (49:30 - 49:35)
is happening right whereas ogrepon is (49:32 - 49:37)
like we don't know what's happening (49:35 - 49:41)
there at all and I'm sure well (49:37 - 49:44)
I'm sure a Pokemon will make a story I'm (49:41 - 49:45)
sure Pokemon story will make sense it's (49:44 - 49:47)
not a true statement all of us have (49:45 - 49:49)
played X and Y none of that made sense (49:47 - 49:52)
uh but in this case (49:49 - 49:55)
at least the turtle is making sense in (49:52 - 49:56)
the fact that the disc is being (49:55 - 49:58)
corrupted something to do with the time (49:56 - 50:00)
machine we know where the cells are (49:58 - 50:01)
coming from we know probably where the (50:00 - 50:04)
Terra is coming from it's it's probably (50:01 - 50:06)
something to do with this turtle (50:04 - 50:09)
uh so in that regards (50:06 - 50:12)
the turtle is cool and it's really hard (50:09 - 50:15)
to gauge from this picture is is this (50:12 - 50:16)
turtle (50:15 - 50:17)
like (50:16 - 50:21)
Tortuga size or is this Turtle (50:17 - 50:24)
eternity size like because when you see (50:21 - 50:26)
it in the book you definitely expect it (50:24 - 50:29)
to be giant yeah which is a thing (50:26 - 50:32)
Pokemon loves to do they love to give (50:29 - 50:34)
you a giant Pokemon and then when you (50:32 - 50:38)
catch it it is no longer giant Pokemon (50:34 - 50:41)
yes it could have an alternate form or (50:38 - 50:43)
something like that for sure right we (50:41 - 50:46)
will never get hand for maternities or (50:43 - 50:48)
whatever it can right right oh this this (50:46 - 50:51)
reminds me of uh after in Legends after (50:48 - 50:53)
you catch Arceus and then you go and (50:51 - 50:56)
it's like in your pasture (50:53 - 50:56)
just chilling in the pasture now next to (50:59 - 51:05)
like a weasel (51:02 - 51:07)
a big weasel (51:05 - 51:07)
I think this is this is probably the (51:10 - 51:14)
thing we'll we'll end on (51:12 - 51:16)
um and again obviously they'll you know (51:14 - 51:18)
there'll be more episodes coming and we (51:16 - 51:20)
can talk about everything else you know (51:18 - 51:22)
that we missed (51:20 - 51:24)
um but I think on the the end on is kind (51:22 - 51:26)
of like (51:24 - 51:29)
we can put the Kalos rumors (51:26 - 51:32)
it's a bed at this point right unless I (51:29 - 51:34)
don't know uh the the Japanese festival (51:32 - 51:36)
that we're going to is somewhere in (51:34 - 51:39)
Kalos and not in Japan but like there's (51:36 - 51:41)
no rumors are getting put to bed to rest (51:39 - 51:45)
until we're on gen 10. yeah I agree is (51:41 - 51:49)
in the past honestly but the the thing (51:45 - 51:51)
that is like (51:49 - 51:53)
for as much as people want to go back to (51:51 - 51:55)
Kalos and there's a bunch of reasons why (51:53 - 51:57)
right and there's a bunch of you know I (51:55 - 51:59)
know I would say reaching I would say (51:57 - 52:00)
people like just trying to put two and (51:59 - 52:05)
two together you know there was well a z (52:00 - 52:08)
is area zero that's like uh it's just (52:05 - 52:10)
kind of stretch uh the giant crater (52:08 - 52:12)
could have been caused by the cannon (52:10 - 52:13)
from (52:12 - 52:16)
Kalos well you know that also doesn't (52:13 - 52:18)
make sense because like if you just went (52:16 - 52:20)
to school and you read the books like (52:18 - 52:22)
the Creator isn't that old the Canon is (52:20 - 52:25)
really or the the crater is older than (52:22 - 52:27)
the Canon I think they're around the (52:25 - 52:28)
same age actually (52:27 - 52:30)
oh I don't think they're don't start (52:28 - 52:31)
this (52:30 - 52:33)
no they're they're not they're not the (52:31 - 52:36)
same though I know this that there's (52:33 - 52:39)
they're not they're not close (52:36 - 52:42)
stop this you're not close (52:39 - 52:44)
um there was like glamora looks like the (52:42 - 52:46)
flower cannon (52:44 - 52:48)
like uh glamora looks like a flower the (52:46 - 52:50)
flower cannon looks like a flower (52:48 - 52:52)
um there's like oh there's a trainer (52:50 - 52:54)
with a Noibat next to the area that (52:52 - 52:56)
seems like that's Kalos and there's (52:54 - 52:58)
another trainer with a Goodra there's (52:56 - 53:00)
another trainer with a some other gen (52:58 - 53:01)
six Pokemon (53:00 - 53:03)
okay I can cry (53:01 - 53:05)
and correct treasure hunt was 2 000 (53:03 - 53:06)
years ago (53:05 - 53:09)
Crystal from X and Y was (53:06 - 53:11)
the Creator is probably older (53:09 - 53:14)
yes I think one of the history teachers (53:11 - 53:15)
does tell you the crater's age but I (53:14 - 53:17)
don't I don't remember it and then what (53:15 - 53:19)
the reason I have on what's up I have (53:17 - 53:21)
all my class notes pulled up you got (53:19 - 53:23)
your notes yeah (53:21 - 53:25)
you know and then the the treasures of (53:23 - 53:27)
Ruin those are they came like what like (53:25 - 53:29)
200 years ago or something the treasures (53:27 - 53:32)
of Ruin I don't think those had uh no (53:29 - 53:35)
they must have (53:32 - 53:35)
all my class notes are not as organized (53:35 - 53:38)
as I want them to be (53:37 - 53:41)
this is why you're failing Hannah (53:38 - 53:43)
getting getting no perfect attendance (53:41 - 53:45)
getting kicked out of class uh the other (53:43 - 53:47)
thing was like cells right we have a (53:45 - 53:49)
cell problem that's taking over there's (53:47 - 53:52)
a Pokemon in Kalos that is cell based (53:49 - 53:56)
his name is Zygarde uh Zygarde can (53:52 - 53:58)
change forms he could be a dog he can be (53:56 - 54:00)
a Power Ranger he can be a snake maybe (53:58 - 54:03)
he could be a turtle uh (54:00 - 54:06)
I don't think Zygarde could be a turtle (54:03 - 54:08)
because now we see the turtle and we (54:06 - 54:10)
know the turtle is not Zygarde and (54:08 - 54:12)
Zygarde was based off of Loki and I (54:10 - 54:14)
don't think Loki turns into a turtle (54:12 - 54:17)
yeah (54:14 - 54:17)
and this was you know (54:17 - 54:22)
with all with everyone stretching and (54:19 - 54:24)
trying to figure out who is like you (54:22 - 54:27)
know how this is connected to Kalos it (54:24 - 54:30)
always just dumbfounded me of like (54:27 - 54:32)
number one (54:30 - 54:35)
callous it was already (54:32 - 54:37)
shafted (54:35 - 54:39)
and didn't get a z didn't get a finished (54:37 - 54:42)
story like Zygarde cells got moved into (54:39 - 54:43)
sudden Moon and they didn't even do that (54:42 - 54:46)
well in sun and moon like why would you (54:43 - 54:49)
want it added on to a new region for it (54:46 - 54:52)
to not like fully Breathe Again (54:49 - 54:55)
number two there are so many unanswered (54:52 - 54:57)
questions in paldea (54:55 - 55:00)
why would they just abandon that to go (54:57 - 55:01)
back to Kalos which already had a (55:00 - 55:03)
terrible story (55:01 - 55:05)
number all the answers are there in (55:03 - 55:08)
Calif they're all there number three you (55:05 - 55:11)
these people are given game freak way (55:08 - 55:14)
too much credit to go oh yeah when we (55:11 - 55:17)
made gen six we were ripping for Gen 9 (55:14 - 55:21)
like what in what Universe do you think (55:17 - 55:23)
they were prepping this far ahead like (55:21 - 55:26)
just nothing lined up (55:23 - 55:28)
so (55:26 - 55:32)
there could be a third DLC I guess there (55:28 - 55:35)
could be a gallon look there could be (55:32 - 55:36)
there could be a lot of stuff (55:35 - 55:39)
uh but at least (55:36 - 55:40)
what we're getting this year doesn't (55:39 - 55:42)
seem to be (55:40 - 55:46)
uh us going to lumio city anytime soon (55:42 - 55:50)
no now with the second DLC being in the (55:46 - 55:51)
water (55:50 - 55:53)
could we see an echo the dolphin (55:51 - 55:56)
crossover absolutely and I think that's (55:53 - 55:59)
why I like the second DLC so much about (55:56 - 56:01)
it it's got that setting do you think (55:59 - 56:04)
IGN is going to say too much water on (56:01 - 56:09)
your way to undoubtedly the blueberry (56:04 - 56:09)
um also I was thinking maybe it's (56:10 - 56:14)
blueberry Academy because it's not (56:11 - 56:15)
paldea (56:14 - 56:17)
so it's not Spanish like no they said (56:15 - 56:21)
that that school is in your District (56:17 - 56:23)
yes they specifically say this school is (56:21 - 56:26)
in your District but the other school is (56:23 - 56:28)
outside of paldea and you're a foreign (56:26 - 56:31)
exchange student (56:28 - 56:32)
the blueberry Academy is the one that's (56:31 - 56:34)
that you're going to though right you're (56:32 - 56:35)
the foreign exchange student at the (56:34 - 56:37)
blueberry Academy (56:35 - 56:38)
I think you're a foreign exchange (56:37 - 56:41)
student to both (56:38 - 56:41)
Oh I thought you were a foreign exchange (56:41 - 56:45)
student at Blueberry Academy which is (56:43 - 56:47)
why I was thinking it's not in Spanish (56:45 - 56:50)
because it's a different region (56:47 - 56:50)
so the blueberry Academy is your (56:51 - 56:56)
Academy's sister school and you are (56:54 - 56:57)
traveling there as an exchange student (56:56 - 57:01)
sister schools can be indifferent (56:57 - 57:02)
countries (57:01 - 57:05)
and it does say exchange student (57:02 - 57:08)
so yeah that might be why that's why in (57:05 - 57:09)
Spanish because it doesn't say exchange (57:08 - 57:12)
student for the yep other festival too (57:09 - 57:14)
uh for the festival no yeah oh that's (57:12 - 57:17)
just a school trip oh okay okay that's (57:14 - 57:19)
like a little vacation that's where you (57:17 - 57:21)
gotta get your permission slips my (57:19 - 57:22)
parents never signed my permission slip (57:21 - 57:24)
I didn't go on a law school trips there (57:22 - 57:25)
was a ten dollar fee to go to the zoo (57:24 - 57:29)
guess you're not going to the zoo oh (57:25 - 57:32)
sorry to hear we have a zoo here if you (57:29 - 57:33)
want to come to San Diego I can take you (57:32 - 57:35)
to the zoo I've been to that Zoo it's (57:33 - 57:37)
also like eighty dollars to get to that (57:35 - 57:39)
City I have passes I can get you and we (57:37 - 57:41)
can go (57:39 - 57:41)
um (57:43 - 57:48)
overall uh I don't know final take how (57:45 - 57:52)
excited on uh on a scale of uh you know (57:48 - 57:56)
one to Pikachu are we for for this DLC (57:52 - 57:58)
laughs (57:56 - 57:58)
for the first one of five I still feel (57:58 - 58:03)
like it's uh I still feel like it's a (58:01 - 58:05)
filler episode nothing's convinced me (58:03 - 58:07)
otherwise yet so I'm not as excited for (58:05 - 58:10)
the first one for the second one (58:07 - 58:13)
uh I don't know if I it has battle tower (58:10 - 58:14)
Vibes which makes me think there might (58:13 - 58:17)
not be as much story but also it has the (58:14 - 58:19)
Pokemon that has to do with the story so (58:17 - 58:23)
I'm expecting answers there and I want (58:19 - 58:26)
it now so that one's Pikachu level okay (58:23 - 58:27)
all right (58:26 - 58:29)
yeah I would say I would say same I'm (58:27 - 58:32)
not as excited for the first one but I (58:29 - 58:35)
am excited for both of them uh Pikachu (58:32 - 58:37)
for the second one or Echo the dolphin (58:35 - 58:40)
level for the second one if it's me uh (58:37 - 58:43)
just makes sense (58:40 - 58:43)
the first one is pretty it's it seems (58:43 - 58:48)
very well themed it looks like it will (58:46 - 58:50)
be enjoyable but it I am not convinced (58:48 - 58:51)
yet that it has the story I'm looking (58:50 - 58:53)
for yeah (58:51 - 58:57)
being almost like a Side Story and also (58:53 - 58:59)
just I could see it being that and it (58:57 - 59:02)
being like a beautiful scenery and you (58:59 - 59:04)
know just a different location and then (59:02 - 59:07)
second one now we're diving back into (59:04 - 59:10)
the story and (59:07 - 59:12)
uh going that route and and then kind of (59:10 - 59:14)
figuring it all out or whatever they (59:12 - 59:17)
decide to tell us at the end (59:14 - 59:21)
yeah I'm more excited for the first but (59:17 - 59:22)
uh (59:21 - 59:25)
they both seem great I'm I'm I I guess I (59:22 - 59:27)
had no expectations for DLC and what (59:25 - 59:29)
they showed I was like (59:27 - 59:31)
sign me up (59:29 - 59:35)
yep let's drive for sure give me some (59:31 - 59:37)
