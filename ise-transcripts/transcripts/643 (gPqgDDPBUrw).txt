I am I am recording (0:00 - 0:13)
[Music] (0:04 - 0:13)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:13 - 0:18)
the 600 43rd episode of the Pokemon (0:15 - 0:20)
podcast it&#39;s super effective I&#39;m your (0:18 - 0:23)
host Steve with me is (0:20 - 0:26)
Hannah I am here I just went on a really (0:23 - 0:28)
long walk and I didn&#39;t open Pok√©mon go (0:26 - 0:30)
once I&#39;m really hoping it registered my (0:28 - 0:34)
steps Pokemon go fell off it&#39;s D though (0:30 - 0:36)
no I just wasn&#39;t the right time to (0:34 - 0:41)
[Laughter] (0:36 - 0:41)
open just not the right time to S I (0:42 - 0:47)
didn&#39;t mean to cut you off you&#39;re good (0:45 - 0:49)
just wasn&#39;t the right kind of walk to to (0:47 - 0:51)
have that app open I&#39;m I&#39;m just hoping (0:49 - 0:53)
it it registered in my eggs that I&#39;m (0:51 - 0:56)
working on that&#39;s I&#39;m in in the Pokemon (0:53 - 0:59)
Eggs want to get those Pokemon hatch got (0:56 - 1:04)
it uh uh Bobby (0:59 - 1:04)
also my uh my Pokemon go time has (1:04 - 1:10)
actually dropped considerably since (1:07 - 1:14)
pocket came out so uh yeah I&#39;m taking (1:10 - 1:17)
walks and not playing Pokemon go either (1:14 - 1:18)
oh my (1:17 - 1:21)
gosh well your your Pokemon sh go shill (1:18 - 1:24)
is here let me tell you about how good I (1:21 - 1:27)
I actually we probably have Pokemon go (1:24 - 1:28)
news but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have enough (1:27 - 1:31)
time to talk about it this episode (1:28 - 1:34)
uh in some well actually in Pokemon go (1:31 - 1:37)
news I will be leaving the country in a (1:34 - 1:40)
couple days to go to Japan to play (1:37 - 1:44)
Pokemon go uh full disclosure Niantic (1:40 - 1:46)
paid for zero of this (1:44 - 1:49)
trip I want that to be very (1:46 - 1:52)
clear no trains no hotels no flights (1:49 - 1:57)
nothing paid for um that&#39;s okay though I (1:52 - 2:01)
the two things one I very (1:57 - 2:03)
excited also slightly privileged to be (2:01 - 2:05)
able to go to Japan twice in a year I (2:03 - 2:06)
understand well technically three times (2:05 - 2:08)
if you count the one day I was in Japan (2:06 - 2:10)
for a layover (2:08 - 2:15)
um I don&#39;t know in what other Universe I (2:10 - 2:18)
would be able to go to Japan in November (2:15 - 2:20)
because there&#39;s almost always a Pokemon (2:18 - 2:22)
game around that time which makes it (2:20 - 2:24)
very difficult so since there is no (2:22 - 2:28)
Pokemon game that was part of like maybe (2:24 - 2:30)
I should go to this uh and I do want to (2:28 - 2:34)
see what a wild area is compared to a (2:30 - 2:37)
safari zone or a city Safari or a go (2:34 - 2:41)
Fest or you NOA tour um because I would (2:37 - 2:43)
speculate that there will be more wild (2:41 - 2:46)
areas based on more gigantamax (2:43 - 2:49)
Pokemon going for that would be my guess (2:46 - 2:51)
that they&#39;re not this doesn&#39;t seem like (2:49 - 2:55)
a oneandone kind of (2:51 - 2:55)
thing uh so yeah we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re going (2:56 - 3:01)
to see I&#39;m going to turn back on the (3:00 - 3:05)
stream backpack so um depending on your (3:01 - 3:07)
time zone you&#39;ll be able to see what a (3:05 - 3:12)
wild area in Japan will be uh when I (3:07 - 3:15)
stream it assuming everything is working (3:12 - 3:19)
so plus like as much fun as I am with (3:15 - 3:21)
pocket and we will be talking about (3:19 - 3:24)
pocket this episode I don&#39;t know the (3:21 - 3:27)
longevity of streaming pocket on (3:24 - 3:29)
Twitch yeah but what if you stream (3:27 - 3:30)
pocket (3:29 - 3:33)
while walking around outside that would (3:30 - 3:35)
be cool you know would be it would never (3:33 - 3:37)
happened but if trading came out this (3:35 - 3:39)
week and then I could start trading for (3:37 - 3:42)
japanese cards while in Japan that would (3:39 - 3:44)
be so cool like yeah I&#39;m it&#39;s not going (3:42 - 3:46)
to work out that way I&#39;m at the wild (3:44 - 3:48)
area not playing Pokemon go I&#39;m just (3:46 - 3:50)
asking people if they want to trade like (3:48 - 3:54)
Japanese Squirtles or (3:50 - 3:54)
something that would be a stream um so (3:54 - 4:01)
yeah uh I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be in Japan (3:58 - 4:04)
um sometime this week however time zones (4:01 - 4:06)
work out I leave on Tuesday get there on (4:04 - 4:08)
Wednesday still have to like fly to (4:06 - 4:10)
Fukuoka at that point there are no there (4:08 - 4:12)
are no flights from I don&#39;t think (4:10 - 4:14)
anywhere in America to directly to (4:12 - 4:17)
Fukuoka don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think that (4:14 - 4:20)
exists yeah no I don&#39;t think so it&#39;s (4:17 - 4:25)
it&#39;s either like Osaka or Tokyo yes or (4:20 - 4:28)
maybe saparo you can probably get to I (4:25 - 4:31)
don&#39;t know how big their airport is (4:28 - 4:33)
but Pro probably up (4:31 - 4:36)
there um so what we&#39;re going to be doing (4:33 - 4:37)
is we&#39;re recording this on Saturday (4:36 - 4:39)
night this will come out on Monday and (4:37 - 4:40)
then on Sunday we&#39;re going to be (4:39 - 4:44)

um while I&#39;m in Japan to make sure you (4:46 - 4:53)
guys get it on Monday and also to make (4:49 - 4:55)
sure I don&#39;t have to Lug extra equipment (4:53 - 4:58)
across Japan if I was just going to like (4:55 - 5:00)
Tokyo and I was just like well my hotel (4:58 - 5:02)
hell is just here that would be fine but (5:00 - 5:04)
I have to get on another plane and then (5:02 - 5:06)
I got to come (5:04 - 5:08)

with the Pokemon (5:19 - 5:23)
sleep Hannah you said you have not been (5:20 - 5:26)
playing Pokemon go it&#39;s a dead game we (5:23 - 5:29)
all know this I I have I have actually (5:26 - 5:31)
and I&#39;ve been playing it more because I (5:29 - 5:34)
have a new routine that I&#39;m trying where (5:31 - 5:38)
I wake up and I go to my cheap $100 (5:34 - 5:42)
exercise bike and I spend 30 minutes (5:38 - 5:45)
playing Pokemon Masters dailies Pokemon (5:42 - 5:48)
TCG pocket dailies Pokemon sleep dailies (5:45 - 5:50)
and Pokemon go dailies and I just get (5:48 - 5:53)
all of that done while on the B first (5:50 - 5:56)
thing in the morning who&#39;s the shill on (5:53 - 5:58)
this podcast now she doesn&#39;t ride the (5:56 - 6:00)
bik I don&#39;t pay for any of (5:58 - 6:03)
talking she sits on the bike does all of (6:00 - 6:05)
her Pokemon stuff off the bike that&#39;s (6:03 - 6:07)
what I would do 100% I&#39;d be like all (6:05 - 6:09)
right time for the bike it&#39;s working (6:07 - 6:10)
really (6:09 - 6:13)
well I can fit it all into 30 minutes (6:10 - 6:16)
all four of those apps no Cafe mix (6:13 - 6:20)
you&#39;re not going to squeeze that one (6:16 - 6:20)
in okay so I have been doing the Pokemon (6:22 - 6:28)
sleep dailies most of the time on on on (6:25 - 6:32)
the exercise bike (6:28 - 6:32)
uh all right all I got Pokemon sleep (6:33 - 6:42)
news for you uh November 21st is Eevee (6:38 - 6:44)
day this is the second time we will be (6:42 - 6:46)
getting Eevee day in Pokemon sleep it is (6:44 - 6:49)
a week-long event during the event Eevee (6:46 - 6:51)
and its Evolutions are more likely to (6:49 - 6:53)
appear you may even encounter a shiny (6:51 - 6:57)
Eevee uh if you do conduct research on (6:53 - 6:59)
eveve day which is November 21st you (6:57 - 7:01)
will will get uh (6:59 - 7:04)
1,121 bonus sleep points you can also (7:01 - 7:08)
get uh EV incense by doing limited uh (7:04 - 7:10)
missions that will start on the 18th so (7:08 - 7:12)
not the week this podcast comes out the (7:10 - 7:16)
following week uh and it will it will go (7:12 - 7:19)
until Monday November 25th they are (7:16 - 7:20)
saying EVN it&#39;s evolution is more likely (7:19 - 7:23)
to appear you may I&#39;m I think when they (7:20 - 7:25)
say you may meet shiny Eevee is the (7:23 - 7:27)
increased shiny chance they always word (7:25 - 7:32)
it slightly weird think so (7:27 - 7:32)
we can always see Shiny Eevee like (7:32 - 7:36)
there&#39;s some chance well and it was (7:34 - 7:39)
definitely boosted last year yeah okay (7:36 - 7:41)
got it I wouldn&#39;t know but this is this (7:39 - 7:44)
is the big thing to keep in mind uh if (7:41 - 7:46)
you don&#39;t care about Eevee I guess uh if (7:44 - 7:48)
you do care about Eevee also keep this (7:46 - 7:50)
in mind the chance of helper Pokemon&#39;s (7:48 - 7:54)
main skill will be triggered by 1.5 so (7:50 - 7:56)
if you&#39;re a gold duck player very good (7:54 - 7:59)
for you if you&#39;ve committed to the drift (7:56 - 8:02)
drift meta which is the same as (7:59 - 8:04)
Golduck just more (8:02 - 8:07)
randomized also good for (8:04 - 8:09)
you uh but obviously if you&#39;re a wiggly (8:07 - 8:12)
tough gavor Sylveon those will proc more (8:09 - 8:16)
often so uh it would require you to (8:12 - 8:18)
check the app more to take advantage of (8:16 - 8:21)
those skill triggers but you could also (8:18 - 8:24)
run a combination like a magnone to give (8:21 - 8:26)
you a bigger pot size but then also like (8:24 - 8:28)
a Blastoise to give you more ingredients (8:26 - 8:30)
to then put into that bigger pot so (8:28 - 8:33)
uh it does give you a little bit more (8:30 - 8:37)
flexibility uh all the islands are valid (8:33 - 8:40)
here so if you do go to green grass that (8:37 - 8:43)
is Eevee on every evolution Sion Beach (8:40 - 8:45)
is only going to be Eevee and Vaporeon I (8:43 - 8:48)
have two shiny vaporeons I&#39;m please no (8:45 - 8:53)
more stay away uh top top Hollow is (8:48 - 8:56)
going to be Eevee Flareon Espeon Umbreon (8:53 - 9:00)
snow drop is just Eevee and glacon (8:56 - 9:03)
Lakeside is Eevee Espeon Leafeon and (9:00 - 9:08)
then uh gold power plant is Eevee and (9:03 - 9:11)
jolon so why is why is why are we (9:08 - 9:15)
getting uh not as much sylvon here I was (9:11 - 9:16)
noticing that the only place you can get (9:15 - 9:18)
sylv on is on Greengrass it does not (9:16 - 9:21)
show up on any other Island as well and (9:18 - 9:23)
it&#39;s the only one that doesn&#39;t show up (9:21 - 9:26)
on another (9:23 - 9:26)
Island none of the islands are fairy are (9:26 - 9:33)
they no but yeah I feel (9:30 - 9:36)
like s Beach is fairy okay it should be (9:33 - 9:39)
there cuz wly gets a boost I never go to (9:36 - 9:40)
San (9:39 - 9:42)
Beach yeah I don&#39;t know I thought it was (9:40 - 9:44)
weird that uh sylveon&#39;s only on green (9:42 - 9:48)
grass for this and nowhere else MH I (9:44 - 9:50)
don&#39;t know that&#39;s the evolution I&#39;d be (9:48 - 9:51)
most interested in at this point like (9:50 - 9:54)
just because I have for me I have like (9:51 - 9:57)
good stuff for the other ones and (9:54 - 10:00)
so I would like to see a Sylveon but I (9:57 - 10:01)
don&#39;t know that I want to be on Green (10:00 - 10:05)
Grass either it&#39;s so it&#39;s weird that (10:01 - 10:06)
sylveon&#39;s only on green grass but also (10:05 - 10:09)
Espeon gets like double it gets topalo (10:06 - 10:12)
and Lapis and no other Evolution gets (10:09 - 10:14)
the double treatment I don&#39;t know do you (10:12 - 10:16)
think it&#39;s possible that&#39;s a that&#39;s (10:14 - 10:17)
actually a typo and there like one of (10:16 - 10:19)
those is supposed to be Sylveon instead (10:17 - 10:20)
of (10:19 - 10:23)
Espeon I don&#39;t think Sylveon well Espeon (10:20 - 10:25)
makes sense and Laps side because Lake (10:23 - 10:28)
sorry lap laps side lapis Lakeside (10:25 - 10:32)
because that is a psychic area and a (10:28 - 10:35)
grass area but (10:32 - 10:40)
it Espeon doesn&#39;t makes sense Topo but (10:35 - 10:42)
also Sylveon doesn&#39;t make sense there (10:40 - 10:44)
either I guess I just think of Sylveon (10:42 - 10:48)
on lapis because Ral is on lapis but so (10:44 - 10:50)
that or like you know because cardor but (10:48 - 10:54)
that&#39;s otherwise yeah but Roz is psychic (10:50 - 10:57)
fairy which means it&#39;s dominant one is (10:54 - 10:59)
psychic is it psychic until it becom (10:57 - 11:01)
Gore and then becomes (10:59 - 11:03)
fairy no it stays psychic the entire (11:01 - 11:06)
time oh gavor psychic yeah cuz fair is (11:03 - 11:08)
its secondary typing never mind that&#39;s (11:06 - 11:10)
not always true though because that&#39;s (11:08 - 11:12)
not always true in this game Houndoom Is (11:10 - 11:14)
We I went over this with someone one (11:12 - 11:16)
time and Houndoom is its second type and (11:14 - 11:18)
not its (11:16 - 11:21)
first is it is it fire dark I think so (11:18 - 11:24)
and it&#39;s yeah and it&#39;s dark and I I had (11:21 - 11:26)
I&#39;ve had this conversation with someone (11:24 - 11:28)
before I know I have cuz we were I was (11:26 - 11:30)
all of the starters all the all of the (11:28 - 11:32)
paldan starters yeah that&#39;s true the (11:30 - 11:34)
paldan starters switch at the very end (11:32 - 11:36)
and Alia&#39;s (11:34 - 11:40)
Dragon yes yes gavor is psychic fairy no (11:36 - 11:43)
one correct me I was right no I didn&#39;t I (11:40 - 11:46)
believed you I was just saying yeah no (11:43 - 11:48)
Gore does not change to fairy at the end (11:46 - 11:50)
it stays psychic oh I don&#39;t know why I (11:48 - 11:52)
thought it was fairy that whole (11:50 - 11:55)
time I wouldn&#39;t know I don&#39;t have one so (11:52 - 11:58)
yeah I yeah I still don&#39;t have a Rolls (11:55 - 12:03)
I&#39;m at uh 32 Eves caught I think and you (11:58 - 12:05)
get the you get the oh I went hard that (12:03 - 12:08)
first Eevee (12:05 - 12:08)
day well also like I just don&#39;t have any (12:09 - 12:14)
good (12:13 - 12:18)
Eevees really like there well I mean (12:14 - 12:19)
they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of difficult (12:18 - 12:24)
Pokemon to get good ones of yeah to a (12:19 - 12:26)
certain extent I have a very very good (12:24 - 12:29)
Vaporeon and I am really enjoying that (12:26 - 12:32)
with the double skill proc mhm yeah (12:29 - 12:33)
that&#39;s (12:32 - 12:37)
nice yeah it&#39;s like I feel like with I&#39;m (12:33 - 12:39)
not I&#39;m not like a super like I&#39;m not a (12:37 - 12:42)
Min maxer in Pokemon sleep I&#39;ve talked (12:39 - 12:45)
about this but at least with like Eevee (12:42 - 12:47)
you have to com some of the EES you have (12:45 - 12:49)
to commit to like using them on your (12:47 - 12:51)
team to evolve them so it&#39;s like if I (12:49 - 12:53)
want Umbreon I have to sleep with an (12:51 - 12:54)
Eevee for like two that&#39;s a weird (12:53 - 12:58)
sentence with for like 200 hours I think (12:54 - 13:00)
wasn&#39;t going to say anything but and and (12:58 - 13:03)
then evolve it at nighttime and then (13:00 - 13:05)
it&#39;s an Espeon or (13:03 - 13:08)
Umbreon so it&#39;s like I I don&#39;t want to (13:05 - 13:11)
put uh I don&#39;t want to do all that work (13:08 - 13:12)
for something that is mediocre right (13:11 - 13:15)
like a like a squirtle has such a low (13:12 - 13:17)
barrier to entry to be like ah you know (13:15 - 13:20)
this is a B+ Squirtle but like 40 candy (13:17 - 13:23)
and now it&#39;s a war torle and 180 more (13:20 - 13:25)
candy and out of Blastoise like 200 (13:23 - 13:27)
hours of sleeping with Eevee is so much (13:25 - 13:29)
to be like well you better be a really (13:27 - 13:31)
good um on after I commit this to (13:29 - 13:34)
you yeah I mean I I get that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve (13:31 - 13:36)
definitely done that with ones that are (13:34 - 13:40)
easier like I have two quaal just (13:36 - 13:43)
because level 30 leak and so I just swim (13:40 - 13:46)
and leak all day long and also a weird (13:43 - 13:49)
sentence (13:46 - 13:49)
also and uh you know just cook up those (13:50 - 13:55)
ninja salads like every meal for the (13:53 - 13:58)
last like 3 weeks cuz just quaal (13:55 - 14:00)
everywhere but (13:58 - 14:02)
uh I I understand what you&#39;re saying (14:00 - 14:03)
like especially with those ones yeah (14:02 - 14:06)
eeve like that I think what I mean like (14:03 - 14:08)
Igglybuff is like there&#39;s a few others (14:06 - 14:09)
where it&#39;s like you got to sleep for a (14:08 - 14:11)
bunch of hours igly up short it&#39;s only (14:09 - 14:14)
like 20 hours or something but I know it (14:11 - 14:16)
took me a long time to evolve my rolu (14:14 - 14:18)
into Lucario because it was shiny and I (14:16 - 14:20)
wanted to evolve it and now it&#39;s never (14:18 - 14:22)
on my team because it&#39;s kind of (14:20 - 14:26)
useless do that cuz it was shiny it was (14:22 - 14:30)
my first shiny and I like though right (14:26 - 14:32)
yeah that which I think from what I&#39;ve (14:30 - 14:33)
been hearing comes in handy when you&#39;re (14:32 - 14:35)
like getting up into the like trying to (14:33 - 14:37)
get to level 60 stuff because of like (14:35 - 14:39)
how much dream shards dream shards do (14:37 - 14:41)
become more important but I&#39;m still not (14:39 - 14:45)
sure how helpful those Pokemon are oh uh (14:41 - 14:47)
yeah I think what&#39;s more helpful than (14:45 - 14:49)
getting than having like Lucario on your (14:47 - 14:53)
team is just getting to max level (14:49 - 14:55)
because then you just get more you&#39;re (14:53 - 14:57)
however it determines like you can&#39;t (14:55 - 14:59)
earn any more level bonus so we&#39;re going (14:57 - 15:00)
to turn it into like bonus dream shards (14:59 - 15:06)
or whatever oh right right so like I was (15:00 - 15:09)
I was swimming in dream shards at what&#39;s (15:06 - 15:12)
the max level 55 or 60 I think it&#39;s 60 (15:09 - 15:15)
right now 60 now so I was swimming in (15:12 - 15:17)
dream shards when the cap was 55 and (15:15 - 15:19)
then I spent all of them but then I (15:17 - 15:23)
continued to be dream Shard Shard poor (15:19 - 15:26)
until I got back up to 60 and now I feel (15:23 - 15:27)
like I&#39;m getting dream (15:26 - 15:30)
shards at a (15:27 - 15:31)
good (15:30 - 15:35)
rate I see uh how long has this game (15:31 - 15:36)
been (15:35 - 15:38)
out a little over a year now right (15:36 - 15:40)
because we did have the year anniversary (15:38 - 15:42)
couple year a couple months ago yeah (15:40 - 15:46)
July okay I just trying to think of like (15:42 - 15:48)
what you&#39;re saying as far as like (15:46 - 15:50)
swimming in dream shards and being level (15:48 - 15:53)
55 with stuff in 60 and how long You&#39; (15:50 - 15:54)
been playing compared to how long I&#39;ve (15:53 - 15:56)
been playing and how I have nothing (15:54 - 16:00)
close to level 55 well okay so (15:56 - 16:05)
so when when uh gold power plant opened (16:00 - 16:08)
there was two pot boosts yeah I think (16:05 - 16:12)
one pop boost was like 180,000 and then (16:08 - 16:15)
the next one was like 240,000 or (16:12 - 16:17)
something so ultimately that was like (16:15 - 16:21)
400,000 dream shards that just gone (16:17 - 16:24)
instantly um and I just did a pot (16:21 - 16:27)
upgrade which I think was like (16:24 - 16:30)
300,000 and I still have 150,000 dream (16:27 - 16:33)
shards left which is a lot of dream (16:30 - 16:37)
shards yeah but like I can still upgrade (16:33 - 16:38)
my pot one more time and I think it (16:37 - 16:44)
wants like 360,000 dream shards gosh (16:38 - 16:47)
that&#39;s a lot but like you don&#39;t but you (16:44 - 16:49)
don&#39;t you don&#39;t start accelerating your (16:47 - 16:51)
dream shards until you hit Max research (16:49 - 16:54)
level MH and like Lucario is never going (16:51 - 16:56)
to like make up the difference there (16:54 - 17:01)
it&#39;s just yeah no but it&#39;s shiny (16:56 - 17:03)
yeah also I know that some of those (17:01 - 17:05)
numbers might be wrong I&#39;m just I don&#39;t (17:03 - 17:06)
have a list of like how many dream (17:05 - 17:08)
shards you exactly need to upgrade your (17:06 - 17:10)
it&#39;s a lot yeah yeah and I&#39;ve been (17:08 - 17:13)
playing the whole time as well kind of a (17:10 - 17:15)
little bit more on and off because (17:13 - 17:17)
moving and all of that I&#39;m only level (17:15 - 17:20)
research rank 52 so I&#39;ve still got a (17:17 - 17:23)
ways to go wait you&#39;re research rank (17:20 - 17:25)
52 (17:23 - 17:28)
yep you might be above me at this point (17:25 - 17:29)
I&#39;m not a premium player (17:28 - 17:32)
that is true that is true Bobby SP money (17:29 - 17:37)
drink 54 yeah yeah I&#39;m 54 yes it is (17:32 - 17:39)
possible to go and play this game faster (17:37 - 17:42)
than I&#39;ve been playing it I do my (17:39 - 17:44)
dailies yeah on the (17:42 - 17:46)
[Laughter] (17:44 - 17:49)
bike although honestly I do have new (17:46 - 17:51)
thoughts about Pokemon sleep now that (17:49 - 17:53)
TCG pocket is (17:51 - 17:55)
out have you not been sleeping as much (17:53 - 17:56)
because you&#39;ve been playing TCG pocket (17:55 - 17:58)
all night no I haven&#39;t been sleeping as (17:56 - 18:00)
much for other reasons (17:58 - 18:03)
not good is this a uh should we should (18:00 - 18:05)
we break and talk about pocket or is (18:03 - 18:08)
this still sleep related I think it&#39;s (18:05 - 18:13)
both related either works the perfect uh (18:08 - 18:16)
segue the perfect Segway all right well (18:13 - 18:18)
let&#39;s take a break then because we are (18:16 - 18:20)
going to talk there&#39;s that that&#39;s kind (18:18 - 18:22)
of it for Pokemon sleep it&#39;s just (18:20 - 18:23)
there&#39;s an Eevee day (18:22 - 18:26)
coming it makes sense and there&#39;s a (18:23 - 18:29)
there&#39;s a um this happens every month (18:26 - 18:31)
but there&#39;s a full moon coming up so get (18:29 - 18:34)
ready for good sleep yeah this week it (18:31 - 18:35)
it&#39;s this week (18:34 - 18:39)
so yes I don&#39;t know there&#39;s a full moon (18:35 - 18:41)
every month yes I know there is but like (18:39 - 18:44)
we&#39;re giving the news we&#39;re giv the (18:41 - 18:47)
news all right uh we&#39;ll take we&#39;ll take (18:44 - 18:49)
a quick break and then uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll (18:47 - 18:52)
see why Hannah hates Pokemon go and (18:49 - 18:55)
Pokemon sleep and loves Pokemon Pock (18:52 - 18:59)
after the break (18:55 - 18:59)
we&#39;ll be right back and we are back from (18:59 - 19:06)
our break all right stage is yours (19:03 - 19:09)
Hannah tell us the I think Bobby has (19:06 - 19:11)
some similar feelings I&#39;ve been seeing (19:09 - 19:14)
in the slack okay that okay Pokemon (19:11 - 19:17)
sleep just or at least I&#39;ve been seeing (19:14 - 19:18)
other people talk about this we&#39;re not (19:17 - 19:20)
focusing as much on Pokemon sleep now (19:18 - 19:22)
that TCG pocket is (19:20 - 19:27)
out and us as in the podcast or us as in (19:22 - 19:32)
people uh people oh okay okay like maybe (19:27 - 19:34)
on the podcast you&#39;re Steve you&#39;re (19:32 - 19:36)
probably still focusing on Pokemon sleep (19:34 - 19:37)
yeah (19:36 - 19:41)
yeah but I don&#39;t know (19:37 - 19:44)
it&#39;s I wasn&#39;t super excited about TCG (19:41 - 19:48)
pocket last week I have since completed (19:44 - 19:53)
uh all of the not quite all all of the (19:48 - 19:55)
stepup battles every (19:53 - 19:58)
single one of the stepup battle things (19:55 - 20:00)
almost the entire ex drop event I (19:58 - 20:03)
decided these are fun um I have decided (20:00 - 20:07)
I enjoy this game and I am finding that (20:03 - 20:09)
when I open the app I&#39;m actually excited (20:07 - 20:12)
about it and when I open Pokemon sleep (20:09 - 20:16)
I&#39;m not in the same way and that makes (20:12 - 20:18)
me feel sad because I really like the (20:16 - 20:21)
development team of Pokemon sleep I (20:18 - 20:23)
really like the art style of Pokemon (20:21 - 20:26)
sleep I even find the concept of Pokemon (20:23 - 20:27)
sleep (20:26 - 20:29)
interesting but it&#39;s not fun in the way (20:27 - 20:31)
that TCG pocket (20:29 - 20:37)
is I 100% agree with that actually (20:31 - 20:40)
and yeah no that&#39;s so true like I (20:37 - 20:42)
wouldn&#39;t say like I (20:40 - 20:47)
don&#39;t so the difference to me is Pokemon (20:42 - 20:49)
so a couple things actually okay for one (20:47 - 20:53)
I&#39;ve stopped wearing my watch to bed so (20:49 - 20:55)
I&#39;m back to like Pok√©ball Plus+ for (20:53 - 20:58)
tracking sleep interesting because I was (20:55 - 21:00)
finding that I wasn&#39;t setting my alarm (20:58 - 21:01)
as often as I used to and so it&#39;s like (21:00 - 21:02)
well I don&#39;t want to wear this big (21:01 - 21:05)
chunky watch to bed if I&#39;m not my main (21:02 - 21:07)
purpose for it was for as an alarm but (21:05 - 21:09)
if I&#39;m able to wake up in the morning (21:07 - 21:11)
without that alarm I&#39;d rather not wear (21:09 - 21:13)
this giant watch to bed like at the end (21:11 - 21:17)
of the day um and so I was thinking like (21:13 - 21:20)
if it&#39;s only for sleep tracking purposes (21:17 - 21:22)
I don&#39;t need that I just use a go Plus+ (21:20 - 21:26)
and work good um also like I feel like I (21:22 - 21:27)
wasn&#39;t I was never getting the amount of (21:26 - 21:29)
sleep I was actually sleeping (21:27 - 21:32)
like with with with regards to Pokemon (21:29 - 21:35)
sleep like I get that it&#39;s sleep (21:32 - 21:36)
tracking is whatever it is right like if (21:35 - 21:38)
I&#39;m not sleeping because I&#39;m rolling (21:36 - 21:39)
around or something too much like I get (21:38 - 21:42)
it but when I go to bed at 1 o&#39;clock in (21:39 - 21:44)
the morning and I wake up at let&#39;s say (21:42 - 21:47)
9:00 a.m. like and I actually my eyes (21:44 - 21:50)
open at 9:00 a.m. and I get up I want to (21:47 - 21:53)
feel that I that in Pokemon sleep I got (21:50 - 21:55)
eight hours of sleep like regardless of (21:53 - 21:58)
what sleep jacking says I&#39;m doing I like (21:55 - 22:00)
I don&#39;t like waking up and then my watch (21:58 - 22:03)
is like oh you woke up at 6:30 and I&#39;m (22:00 - 22:05)
like I didn&#39;t wake up at 6:30 like I (22:03 - 22:07)
woke up at 9:00 like my eyes opened at (22:05 - 22:09)
nine o&#39;clock and I feel like that was (22:07 - 22:11)
happening a lot more often with my watch (22:09 - 22:13)
than with the go Plus+ even though it (22:11 - 22:14)
sits right on my (22:13 - 22:17)
bed so I don&#39;t know yeah what&#39;s going on (22:14 - 22:19)
there but like it was kind of making me (22:17 - 22:22)
like frustrated when I&#39;d wake up and it (22:19 - 22:24)
was like you woke up an hour ago the (22:22 - 22:26)
opposite of what the game intended I&#39;m (22:24 - 22:28)
still really enjoying the the watch (22:26 - 22:30)
tracking so I will say that well that&#39;s (22:28 - 22:33)
and like and if if it&#39;s because like I (22:30 - 22:34)
am moving around a lot so it&#39;s like oh (22:33 - 22:35)
you&#39;re awake or like you&#39;re not like (22:34 - 22:38)
restfully sleeping like that&#39;s fine not (22:35 - 22:40)
fine I shouldn&#39;t I should be restfully (22:38 - 22:42)
sleeping but like I get it but as far as (22:40 - 22:45)
like I&#39;m not tracking my sleep to track (22:42 - 22:46)
my sleep I&#39;m tracking my sleep as a (22:45 - 22:49)
gamify like I want to play a game and I (22:46 - 22:51)
don&#39;t want to like actually figure out (22:49 - 22:53)
what I can do to like restfully sleep I (22:51 - 22:57)
should but that&#39;s not my purpose here so (22:53 - 22:59)
it just feels like the watch I don&#39;t (22:57 - 23:01)
know maybe it tracks it differently or (22:59 - 23:03)
something than a go Plus+ anyways my (23:01 - 23:06)
point is that when I open sleep during (23:03 - 23:09)
the day I feel like I&#39;m opening it (23:06 - 23:10)
because I&#39;m tasked to do something like (23:09 - 23:12)
I&#39;m opening it because I have to do (23:10 - 23:15)
something in the game whereas with (23:12 - 23:17)
pocket I&#39;m opening it because I want to (23:15 - 23:21)
do something and it just feels different (23:17 - 23:24)
in that way yeah I mean pocket has the (23:21 - 23:26)
benefit of you&#39;re opening the app and (23:24 - 23:27)
getting to open a pack of cards and (23:26 - 23:29)
that&#39;s always exciting (23:27 - 23:32)
yeah that is a huge benefit and the (23:29 - 23:35)
thing is is if I have a few minutes and (23:32 - 23:36)
I open the app and it&#39;s like even I (23:35 - 23:38)
don&#39;t have a pack to open it&#39;s like oh (23:36 - 23:40)
but I know I can go do a battle and it&#39;s (23:38 - 23:42)
only going to take like three to five (23:40 - 23:44)
minutes but I get I get to have a full (23:42 - 23:46)
battle in there which I also find really (23:44 - 23:49)
fun yeah and so it is something else to (23:46 - 23:52)
do that I can do as many times as I want (23:49 - 23:55)
in the game without any like without (23:52 - 23:57)
having to pay anything or without having (23:55 - 23:59)
to like put anything more to it like I (23:57 - 24:00)
can just do battle after battle if I (23:59 - 24:03)
want to and I just feel like that kind (24:00 - 24:06)
of stuff isn&#39;t the same in a game like (24:03 - 24:08)
sleep or even in a game like go if I&#39;m (24:06 - 24:11)
being completely honest like unless you (24:08 - 24:14)
PVP and I don&#39;t so there&#39;s that yeah no (24:11 - 24:16)
that&#39;s very very true Pokemon sleep is (24:14 - 24:19)
constrained because you can only do the (24:16 - 24:23)
Sleep uh Cycles in it twice a day at (24:19 - 24:25)
most Pok√©mon go is constrained because (24:23 - 24:27)
you have to actually get outside and go (24:25 - 24:29)
places to see different Pok and spend (24:27 - 24:31)
different Pok√© stops and gyms and things (24:29 - 24:34)
like that but TCG pocket is just all (24:31 - 24:38)
right there all the time always yeah I (24:34 - 24:42)
think um I I think both of your points (24:38 - 24:44)
are valid I think right (24:42 - 24:47)
now almost it feels like Han I&#39;m G to (24:44 - 24:49)
say Hannah specifically flipped because (24:47 - 24:50)
we all knew before this game came out (24:49 - 24:53)
Bobby was going to be how much money (24:50 - 24:56)
Bobby have we put in (24:53 - 24:59)
um I bought all the the discounted (24:56 - 25:03)
gold I bought the gore set that I said I (24:59 - 25:06)
wasn&#39;t going to buy uh that&#39;s all uh (25:03 - 25:09)
it&#39;s about 50 no and then another 10 for (25:06 - 25:12)
gold or something so like (25:09 - 25:15)
60-ish and are you P the one week free (25:12 - 25:17)
trial oh that&#39;ll go yeah that&#39;s going to (25:15 - 25:20)
get whatever that $10 there yeah (25:17 - 25:22)
probably something like that but like (25:20 - 25:24)
here&#39;s the thing okay because because (25:22 - 25:27)
let me defend this choice I am gonna (25:24 - 25:29)
defend this choice and this is why I (25:27 - 25:33)
don&#39;t see myself spending well for one I (25:29 - 25:34)
just surging Sparks came out yesterday (25:33 - 25:36)
and I dropped 80 on cards like no (25:34 - 25:39)
problem so like that like the real TCG (25:36 - 25:42)
still outweighs these mobile games like (25:39 - 25:44)
in a lot of ways when it comes to money (25:42 - 25:46)
but (25:44 - 25:48)
um when it when it comes to like new (25:46 - 25:50)
games like I don&#39;t play that many games (25:48 - 25:52)
the fact that I have three mobile games (25:50 - 25:55)
right now that like I&#39;m actively playing (25:52 - 25:57)
that&#39;s the first time I think ever that (25:55 - 25:59)
I&#39;ve had that many mobile games (25:57 - 26:01)
actively going on in my phone at one (25:59 - 26:03)
time like I don&#39;t play a lot of games (26:01 - 26:06)
and when it comes to console games like (26:03 - 26:09)
I play a couple at a time at most a few (26:06 - 26:12)
a few a year you know um part of that is (26:09 - 26:14)
because when I do find a game that I (26:12 - 26:18)
like I do like to put some money into it (26:14 - 26:20)
to just continue play like if I like the (26:18 - 26:23)
game I just want to continue putting (26:20 - 26:25)
stuff into it to play it not that you (26:23 - 26:26)
can&#39;t play it to its full extent like (26:25 - 26:29)
free to play but it&#39;s like I usually get (26:26 - 26:30)
into it to a point where I&#39;m like oh I (26:29 - 26:31)
want to put some money into this and (26:30 - 26:33)
like get the sets or whatever like open (26:31 - 26:35)
some pack like do more than just like (26:33 - 26:38)
the bare minimum and but I don&#39;t keep (26:35 - 26:39)
that going like forever like I don&#39;t (26:38 - 26:40)
plan on like I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna be (26:39 - 26:44)
spending $60 or80 a month on this game (26:40 - 26:46)
similar to how like (26:44 - 26:48)
dude how long have you been spending (26:46 - 26:50)
money on Pokemon go okay but I also but (26:48 - 26:52)
I also haven&#39;t paid for a raid in (26:50 - 26:54)
Pokemon go in a month and a half that&#39;s (26:52 - 26:57)
just cuz you&#39;re angry at it (26:54 - 26:59)
because s (26:57 - 27:00)
hurt my (26:59 - 27:04)
heart but uh but I mean to that point (27:00 - 27:07)
like I have certain months where I put a (27:04 - 27:09)
lot of money into go and then I have (27:07 - 27:10)
like periods of time where I put very (27:09 - 27:12)
little when it comes to money into (27:10 - 27:16)
Pokemon go so I hey papa pikachu is (27:12 - 27:17)
getting my money from everywhere whether (27:16 - 27:21)
it&#39;s in go in the TCG in pocket but (27:17 - 27:23)
really like when I start playing a game (27:21 - 27:25)
I like to like and I really like it I (27:23 - 27:28)
like to put some money into it just to I (27:25 - 27:30)
don&#39;t know play it to like a fuller (27:28 - 27:33)
extent I guess and I don&#39;t (27:30 - 27:36)
like I don&#39;t know like I again I don&#39;t (27:33 - 27:38)
plan on spending like 60 or80 a month on (27:36 - 27:42)
this game but okay so I think (27:38 - 27:48)
that Pokemon sleep is very Animal (27:42 - 27:52)
Crossing like you can&#39;t rush the (27:48 - 27:54)
day (27:52 - 27:57)
and and if you did not (27:54 - 28:00)
unlock power plant you almost feel at (27:57 - 28:03)
like a disadvantage right like I&#39;m not (28:00 - 28:07)
there yet so I can&#39;t experience it and I (28:03 - 28:11)
do think that after the one-year (28:07 - 28:14)
anniversary and the only real exciting (28:11 - 28:18)
thing we got was Grubb and shins and no (28:14 - 28:20)
we got watch (28:18 - 28:21)
support that wasn&#39;t a one year (28:20 - 28:24)
anniversary thing that&#39;s true you you (28:21 - 28:25)
Hannah specifically got the watch (28:24 - 28:28)
support I&#39;m not the only one excited (28:25 - 28:30)
about this it&#39;s I&#39;m glad they have it I (28:28 - 28:34)
will say that I glad they have it but (28:30 - 28:38)
I so like Pokemon sleep is is what it is (28:34 - 28:41)
right like you are limited in what you (28:38 - 28:44)
can actually do when you open the game (28:41 - 28:45)
which is like I said very Animal (28:44 - 28:48)
Crossing of like I want to build a (28:45 - 28:50)
bridge I can only build one I got to (28:48 - 28:53)
wait till tomorrow if I want to move (28:50 - 28:56)
this house I gotta wait till tomorrow (28:53 - 28:58)
like you can you can like plan things (28:56 - 29:01)
out but even on top of that on top of (28:58 - 29:03)
the Year (29:01 - 29:08)
limited I I do think there has to be (29:03 - 29:11)
some adjustment in the (29:08 - 29:16)
future uh for players because even me (29:11 - 29:19)
who&#39;s at 60 we just talked about how (29:16 - 29:20)
many dream shards I just spent to (29:19 - 29:22)
upgrade a (29:20 - 29:25)
pot (29:22 - 29:30)
like it still feels like this slow grind (29:25 - 29:32)
after a year and a (29:30 - 29:37)
half and part of like I&#39;ve caught 30 EES (29:32 - 29:40)
none of them are are good is is part of (29:37 - 29:41)
that grind of like I I don&#39;t want to do (29:40 - 29:44)
this again like I&#39;ll just stick my level (29:41 - 29:47)
50 Blastoise on the team I&#39;m swimming in (29:44 - 29:51)
milk I&#39;ll just make whatever High (29:47 - 29:55)
ingredient is there cuz like it works (29:51 - 30:00)
and trying and and there&#39;s so much RNG (29:55 - 30:03)
and being like I have 10 shines they&#39;re (30:00 - 30:06)
all bad like I don&#39;t have a single good (30:03 - 30:09)
shins and I&#39;ve been on power (30:06 - 30:12)
plant not last week but this week I (30:09 - 30:14)
haven&#39;t seen a single grubbing (30:12 - 30:18)
yet so I totally get your guys&#39;s (30:14 - 30:20)
perspective of like there&#39;s nothing to (30:18 - 30:23)
do in sleep I get that but also the (30:20 - 30:26)
perspective of TCG last week we talked (30:23 - 30:30)
about how a lot of players were feeling (30:26 - 30:32)
I opened all my packs and now there&#39;s (30:30 - 30:35)
nothing to do and that was very valid (30:32 - 30:39)
last week but then the the the team was (30:35 - 30:42)
like here&#39;s two Wonder kind of event we (30:39 - 30:45)
can do every single kind of event we can (30:42 - 30:47)
throw at you we promise we have events (30:45 - 30:49)
that&#39;s that&#39;s how this game has gone so (30:47 - 30:52)
it was like a 180 and like what happened (30:49 - 30:56)
here of like sleep now having kind of no (30:52 - 30:57)
events or repeating events which is like (30:56 - 30:59)
totally fine (30:57 - 31:01)
but also just being the slow grind where (30:59 - 31:02)
like last (31:01 - 31:05)
week pocket was we don&#39;t have a lot for (31:02 - 31:07)
you to do and now pocket is like Wonder (31:05 - 31:10)
pick event one Wonder pick event two (31:07 - 31:13)
which just went live like two days ago (31:10 - 31:17)
um the battle against Lapras which is (31:13 - 31:21)
what I played early in New York um the (31:17 - 31:23)
so the Lapras event and then finally the (31:21 - 31:25)
the one that also just got announced (31:23 - 31:27)
around Wonder pick 2 which was the I (31:25 - 31:28)
don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re calling it (31:27 - 31:31)
The Apex emblem event I think it&#39;s (31:28 - 31:33)
called Uh something like that yep where (31:31 - 31:36)
you can get like four different emblems (31:33 - 31:39)
for battling real people now there is (31:36 - 31:41)
still no ladder in this (31:39 - 31:47)
game uh but the the Apex emblem event is (31:41 - 31:50)
requiring you to get 45 wins to get all (31:47 - 31:53)
four emblems or 50 wins to get (31:50 - 31:57)
everything in the shop (31:53 - 32:00)
so I&#39;m not surprised Hannah or other (31:57 - 32:02)
people changed their minds on pocket (32:00 - 32:05)
because they just did four events at (32:02 - 32:06)
once and these events will run to the (32:05 - 32:08)
end of the year end of the month most of (32:06 - 32:10)
them run to the end of the month give or (32:08 - 32:13)
take a couple days and I&#39;d (32:10 - 32:17)
be curious if this is that cycle we&#39;re (32:13 - 32:19)
always going to have a Wonder pick event (32:17 - 32:22)
we&#39;re always going to have like a CPU (32:19 - 32:24)
event uh and then we&#39;re always going to (32:22 - 32:27)
have like some sort of kind of a ladder (32:24 - 32:30)
but not not really it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like (32:27 - 32:32)
a cosmetic it&#39;s like a bragging cosmetic (32:30 - 32:36)
ladder yeah yeah like you you want to be (32:32 - 32:40)
competitive because you want to get the (32:36 - 32:40)
Cosmetics but if you don&#39;t care about (32:40 - 32:45)
com Cosmetics then you just ignore (32:42 - 32:47)
it well and having this many events is a (32:45 - 32:49)
little bit overwhelming I will say (32:47 - 32:52)
they&#39;re really really throwing them at (32:49 - 32:55)
us right now and I&#39;m kind of okay with (32:52 - 32:57)
that it&#39;s nice to see how many things (32:55 - 33:00)
this game can can do but I&#39;m only so far (32:57 - 33:02)
investing in two of those so far I&#39;ve (33:00 - 33:04)
only done the Wonder pick event and I&#39;ve (33:02 - 33:06)
done the solo battles event with the (33:04 - 33:07)
Lapras I haven&#39;t done any of the versus (33:06 - 33:10)
battles at all I haven&#39;t done a single (33:07 - 33:11)
versus Battle at all in this game I&#39;m a (33:10 - 33:15)
little bit intimidated by it still (33:11 - 33:18)
um and that&#39;s talked I might miss it (33:15 - 33:20)
because that&#39;s a lot of battles to win (33:18 - 33:22)
it is a lot of battles I talked pretty (33:20 - 33:25)
highly about the Lapras event uh when I (33:22 - 33:28)
was in New York cuz every every cuz when (33:25 - 33:30)
they gave us like the the test phones in (33:28 - 33:32)
New York they gave us like unlimited (33:30 - 33:34)
money so literally people were just (33:32 - 33:36)
ripping P (33:34 - 33:39)
dream and while everyone was ripping (33:36 - 33:41)
packs I was doing the battle system and (33:39 - 33:43)
I I got all the way up to I think what (33:41 - 33:46)
is it expert is the the highest rank of (33:43 - 33:49)
Lapras um and then I think we talked (33:46 - 33:51)
about how like there&#39;s little goals (33:49 - 33:53)
inside of these so for example it&#39;s like (33:51 - 33:56)
beat Lapras on Expert without using any (33:53 - 33:58)
EX Pokemon or any gold star Pokemon or (33:56 - 34:02)
anything like that and I do think that (33:58 - 34:04)
that is really clever and that&#39;s like (34:02 - 34:07)
really fun and it gives replayability of (34:04 - 34:10)
like um how can (34:07 - 34:13)
I build something and understand the (34:10 - 34:15)
fundamental fundamentals of this game (34:13 - 34:17)
without relying on like EXs and stuff (34:15 - 34:19)
and of course like there&#39;s at the end of (34:17 - 34:21)
the day there&#39;s still some RNG where you (34:19 - 34:22)
know you might just get a bad hand and (34:21 - 34:25)
the CPU gets like a perfect hand and you (34:22 - 34:27)
lose but there&#39;s like no penalty to that (34:25 - 34:29)
which I think is great there&#39;s that cool (34:27 - 34:32)
down where you need the I don&#39;t even (34:29 - 34:33)
know what they&#39;re called the little blue (34:32 - 34:36)
gems whatever they are event things but (34:33 - 34:38)
the thing is is that you don&#39;t lose one (34:36 - 34:40)
of those if you lose yeah yeah that&#39;s (34:38 - 34:43)
cool so like I like I like the Synergy (34:40 - 34:46)
between the Lapras event and the Wonder (34:43 - 34:49)
pick event of like I already got two (34:46 - 34:51)
meowths I already got two (34:49 - 34:53)
ches so now I&#39;m trying to get the blue (34:51 - 34:55)
things I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called (34:53 - 34:57)
the event tickets and that or I&#39;m trying (34:55 - 34:58)
to get the wonderglass (34:57 - 35:01)
and I if I get the blue things I can do (34:58 - 35:02)
more Lapras (35:01 - 35:05)
battles to then get more packs of promo (35:02 - 35:07)
cards so I I really really like the (35:05 - 35:11)
Synergy there and the Wonder pick stuff (35:07 - 35:14)
forces you not forces but encourages you (35:11 - 35:17)
to check the app more often and so even (35:14 - 35:19)
if you do open the app you&#39;re like well (35:17 - 35:21)
I don&#39;t have a pack ready I don&#39;t really (35:19 - 35:22)
want to do a battle but I can at least (35:21 - 35:26)
do my Wonder pick for the blue ticket or (35:22 - 35:28)
the chansy or the Meowth (35:26 - 35:30)
um the blue ticket is called the event (35:28 - 35:31)
shop (35:30 - 35:34)
ticket things are called event stamina (35:31 - 35:38)
yeah oh okay so A beautiful currency (35:34 - 35:39)
system they have happening in this game (35:38 - 35:42)
so many so many (35:39 - 35:44)
currencies uh so (35:42 - 35:49)
I I like that a lot in general I as (35:44 - 35:51)
somebody who has played the TCG for a (35:49 - 35:54)
long time I used to play competitively I (35:51 - 35:56)
used to travel to tournaments I top (35:54 - 35:58)
cuted a couple events there&#39;s my (35:56 - 36:00)
LinkedIn resume for you guys but like (35:58 - 36:02)
what normally happens with like the (36:00 - 36:04)
regular TCG if you&#39;re playing ptcg or (36:02 - 36:07)
ptcg live is people get so excited about (36:04 - 36:10)
a new set they get to build all these (36:07 - 36:13)
new decks after maybe a couple weeks or (36:10 - 36:14)
the first big tournament you start (36:13 - 36:17)
seeing meta decks really dominate (36:14 - 36:20)
especially if a deck that no one had on (36:17 - 36:22)
their radar ends up winning a tournament (36:20 - 36:25)
all of a sudden that becomes seen in (36:22 - 36:28)
these games and then because the sets in (36:25 - 36:31)
TCG are 3 months long what happens is (36:28 - 36:33)
that first month is like really good (36:31 - 36:35)
that second month is kind of like (36:33 - 36:36)
hardcore people we&#39;re still we&#39;re (36:35 - 36:38)
practicing for tournaments and then no (36:36 - 36:40)
one is playing that third month because (36:38 - 36:43)
they&#39;re all very bored and staled of the (36:40 - 36:45)
current format and they&#39;re just waiting (36:43 - 36:47)
for the next (36:45 - 36:50)
drop and I do see this (36:47 - 36:55)
happening right now in pocket of like we (36:50 - 36:56)
only have what (36:55 - 36:59)
226 cars cards or something like that (36:56 - 37:02)
and there are there are Decks that (36:59 - 37:04)
exist and there&#39;s not that many trainer (37:02 - 37:06)
cards there&#39;s not that many supporter (37:04 - 37:09)
cards right that&#39;s true and but I do (37:06 - 37:12)
think that these little events can carry (37:09 - 37:15)
that into whatever the next set is but (37:12 - 37:17)
if the next set isn&#39;t for (37:15 - 37:20)
another two and a half months I don&#39;t (37:17 - 37:23)
think that&#39;s particularly good but they (37:20 - 37:24)
the developers did say they don&#39;t have (37:23 - 37:28)
like a solid release schedule yet right (37:24 - 37:29)
but like will I come back for more (37:28 - 37:33)
Wonder pick 100% will I come back for (37:29 - 37:36)
more whatever this Lapras like beat the (37:33 - 37:38)
CPU in different ways to unlock promo (37:36 - 37:42)
cards 100% do I want to grind another 45 (37:38 - 37:44)
battles on top of the 45 battles I&#39;m (37:42 - 37:46)
grinding for some emblems with the (37:44 - 37:47)
current (37:46 - 37:51)
decks I don&#39;t think so I don&#39;t I I think (37:47 - 37:54)
to your point I kind of think that those (37:51 - 37:58)
emblem like the Apex emblem event (37:54 - 38:00)
that that&#39;ll be something that comes (37:58 - 38:02)
with each new set right like I don&#39;t (38:00 - 38:05)
think there&#39;ll be another Apex emblem (38:02 - 38:08)
event in that same way during the (38:05 - 38:11)
genetic Apex time frame like they could (38:08 - 38:13)
have other events I see saying yes so I (38:11 - 38:16)
think like that kind of event 45 wins to (38:13 - 38:18)
get your you know 45 win emblem and all (38:16 - 38:20)
that stuff I think that could be like a (38:18 - 38:25)
setby set thing um but I do see so one (38:20 - 38:27)
thing that I got from the Lapras event (38:25 - 38:30)
was you know you have the Lapras what&#39;s (38:27 - 38:32)
Lapras ex and star me ex is like the (38:30 - 38:36)
most advanced version of it and once you (38:32 - 38:39)
have a deck to to combat that that (38:36 - 38:42)
Lapras deck you know you&#39;re kind of (38:39 - 38:43)
repeating the same thing over and over (38:42 - 38:44)
again right because like one of the (38:43 - 38:48)
tasks in the in the advanced is to beat (38:44 - 38:52)
the to beat the lapas deck 20 times so (38:48 - 38:53)
and then there&#39;s also like six different (38:52 - 38:55)
promo cards you want to collect and you (38:53 - 38:57)
get one pretty much every time you beat (38:55 - 38:59)
that deck so you&#39;re like trying to you (38:57 - 39:00)
know pull the the right cards and (38:59 - 39:04)
everything right um and that definitely (39:00 - 39:06)
is going to it get gets repetitive right (39:04 - 39:08)
like you&#39;re playing this that&#39;s when you (39:06 - 39:11)
turn on auto battle see I I haven&#39;t (39:08 - 39:13)
think Auto Battle is good enough for the (39:11 - 39:16)
the EXP I think it is I&#39;m pretty sure (39:13 - 39:18)
I&#39;ve used it I I could be wrong I&#39;ve (39:16 - 39:20)
used it for every other level below (39:18 - 39:23)
expert it it definitely won for me at (39:20 - 39:26)
expert while I was in New York but and (39:23 - 39:28)
to be fair I&#39;ve only used it once since (39:26 - 39:30)
it&#39;s been out but I like I put on Expert (39:28 - 39:32)
and then I like went to the bathroom to (39:30 - 39:33)
like brush my teeth and everything and I (39:32 - 39:35)
came back and it was like you lost and I (39:33 - 39:37)
was like oh that that (39:35 - 39:40)
sucks yeah I mean I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t (39:37 - 39:42)
used the auto battle but my point is is (39:40 - 39:46)
like okay so with the Lapras deck I put (39:42 - 39:47)
together a really good Pikachu deck and (39:46 - 39:49)
I was playing against that right and (39:47 - 39:50)
that&#39;s great and now I built this (39:49 - 39:51)
Pikachu deck I kind of tweaked it here (39:50 - 39:53)
and there just to like be like oh well (39:51 - 39:54)
how could I better this or make this how (39:53 - 39:56)
could I make this go quicker you know (39:54 - 39:58)
how can I try to beat it in less steps (39:56 - 40:00)
or whatever so tweak it here and there (39:58 - 40:01)
but then you get your deck and it&#39;s like (40:00 - 40:04)
okay this is a really good setup deck I (40:01 - 40:05)
could see them next month now throwing (40:04 - 40:11)
in a Venusaur EX like thing and all of a (40:05 - 40:13)
sudden now you have to come up with a (40:11 - 40:14)
new deck and you&#39;re going to want to (40:13 - 40:16)
tweak that deck you know like so I just (40:14 - 40:17)
feel like they could do those on like a (40:16 - 40:20)
monthly basis and I feel like they could (40:17 - 40:22)
so that even with the same set you&#39;re (40:20 - 40:23)
going to have to start putting together (40:22 - 40:25)
cards you weren&#39;t going to put together (40:23 - 40:26)
before like and you&#39;re against the (40:25 - 40:29)
computer so it doesn&#39;t feel as you don&#39;t (40:26 - 40:31)
have as much pressure as like playing (40:29 - 40:33)
against another real person even though (40:31 - 40:35)
there&#39;s no like when loss (40:33 - 40:37)
record there&#39;s just like the showing you (40:35 - 40:38)
the wins it still feels like there&#39;s (40:37 - 40:39)
more pressure when you&#39;re playing (40:38 - 40:41)
another actual like person than when (40:39 - 40:43)
you&#39;re playing the computer yeah and (40:41 - 40:44)
against the computer you&#39;re you&#39;re (40:43 - 40:46)
playing against the same deck and so you (40:44 - 40:48)
can kind of learn as you&#39;re playing (40:46 - 40:50)
these matches over and over again right (40:48 - 40:53)
I&#39;ve really been enjoying that yeah and (40:50 - 40:56)
yeah I I like the (40:53 - 40:59)
better it&#39;s not surprising to me that (40:56 - 41:02)
there are that this is a lot of people&#39;s (40:59 - 41:06)
first time playing TCG mhm not (41:02 - 41:08)
surprising at all like there was just (41:06 - 41:09)
something basic because I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been (41:08 - 41:13)
streaming the game where I was like you (41:09 - 41:15)
always you always like Pokeball before (41:13 - 41:17)
you Professor Oak and just a ton of (41:15 - 41:19)
people were like wait why and it&#39;s just (41:17 - 41:21)
like well because like you&#39;re you&#39;re (41:19 - 41:23)
thinning out your deck and you&#39;re (41:21 - 41:24)
getting the Basic Pokemon out of your (41:23 - 41:25)
deck so when you Professor Oak you&#39;re (41:24 - 41:27)
getting hopefully like those evolutions (41:25 - 41:30)
or like more trainer cards so you can (41:27 - 41:31)
like Professor Oak again and they&#39;re (41:30 - 41:33)
like oh my gosh that makes sense and (41:31 - 41:35)
like these are things you just from like (41:33 - 41:39)
the normal TCG there&#39;s just a a proper (41:35 - 41:42)
order to like (41:39 - 41:44)
optimize efficiency of how you play (41:42 - 41:48)
right like right and it&#39;s it&#39;s just very (41:44 - 41:50)
obvious like this is a lot of people&#39;s (41:48 - 41:53)
very first time playing the game um but (41:50 - 41:54)
that&#39;s why I think I like the Lapras (41:53 - 41:58)
stuff so much because it&#39;s you can do it (41:54 - 42:00)
you can build a deck that works for you (41:58 - 42:02)
if you want to build like a Pikachu deck (42:00 - 42:03)
to have the advantage against Lapras you (42:02 - 42:06)
can do that but then if you want it to (42:03 - 42:07)
be like you know what I have a really (42:06 - 42:10)
good Mewtwo or maybe my Mewtwo deck&#39;s (42:07 - 42:12)
not good not sure but can can I beat (42:10 - 42:14)
this Lapras Deck with a Mewtwo and you (42:12 - 42:16)
can do that you can still get credit for (42:14 - 42:18)
it and everything uh or like we we said (42:16 - 42:20)
earlier can you build that deck without (42:18 - 42:23)
using any ex&#39;s any gold stars any (42:20 - 42:24)
whatever and then can you beat that (42:23 - 42:28)
Lapras deck so it is it is giving you (42:24 - 42:31)
something to (42:28 - 42:36)
like practice against where I I really (42:31 - 42:39)
appreciate and I think that&#39;s like not (42:36 - 42:42)
only like for me who&#39;s I don&#39;t need the (42:39 - 42:45)
practice but like it&#39;s it&#39;s still like a (42:42 - 42:49)
puzzle to figure out yeah (42:45 - 42:52)
um and (42:49 - 42:58)
the the the Apex emblem event I think is (42:52 - 43:03)
is okay like it is it does feel like a (42:58 - 43:06)
substitute for like a ranked (43:03 - 43:09)
ladder (43:06 - 43:12)
of asking asking a player who maybe is (43:09 - 43:15)
not so you&#39;re asking a player a lot of (43:12 - 43:16)
things and this was what I was kind of (43:15 - 43:20)
worried about last week is there is no (43:16 - 43:24)
denying that this is a pay to win game (43:20 - 43:27)
uh just just just not and I for some (43:24 - 43:30)
reason I I feel like we&#39;ve lost what pay (43:27 - 43:33)
to win means because people will throw (43:30 - 43:35)
pay to win around all the (43:33 - 43:39)
time like what we&#39;ll talk about after (43:35 - 43:43)
the segment of like cellio being able (43:39 - 43:44)
being attached to Pokemon cards and (43:43 - 43:47)
people are like ah paay a win to get (43:44 - 43:50)
cellio let&#39;s back up (43:47 - 43:52)
[Laughter] (43:50 - 43:56)
here pay to win in a mobile game is (43:52 - 43:58)
specifically saying and feel free to if (43:56 - 44:00)
you have your own definition that&#39;s (43:58 - 44:02)
maybe fine I don&#39;t know here here&#39;s how (44:00 - 44:05)
I&#39;m going to Define pay to win is that (44:02 - 44:08)
if me and Bobby are on equal footing as (44:05 - 44:09)
a (44:08 - 44:14)
player and I pay more money to get more (44:09 - 44:18)
in this case cards so I can have more (44:14 - 44:22)
options I have an advantage that is what (44:18 - 44:25)
pay to win is pay to win is not saying (44:22 - 44:28)
I&#39;m always going to win and Bobby is (44:25 - 44:30)
always going to lose cuz I had like I (44:28 - 44:32)
had somebody come in and they&#39;re like (44:30 - 44:34)
this game&#39;s not pay to win I haven&#39;t (44:32 - 44:36)
paid a single penny and I&#39;m still (44:34 - 44:40)
winning that doesn&#39;t discredit what pay (44:36 - 44:44)
to win is when I played Clash Royale for (44:40 - 44:48)
three years I didn&#39;t pay any money and I (44:44 - 44:51)
knew instantly that the person across (44:48 - 44:53)
from me on that field was a Pay to Win (44:51 - 44:56)
player because not only it was very (44:53 - 44:58)
obvious by what they were putting on the (44:56 - 45:01)
field but they&#39;re like you should not be (44:58 - 45:04)
in this rank because your units are so (45:01 - 45:08)
higher level than me and I still won (45:04 - 45:11)
some of those matches that doesn&#39;t (45:08 - 45:13)
discredit that they weren&#39;t paid to win (45:11 - 45:15)
they were just a dog waterer player and (45:13 - 45:19)
that&#39;s fine what happens is you can pay (45:15 - 45:23)
to have an advantage but if you&#39;re still (45:19 - 45:26)
bad at the game the Pay to Win is only (45:23 - 45:28)
going to take you so far just like if (45:26 - 45:31)
you&#39;re free to play but you&#39;re very (45:28 - 45:34)
skilled you you you have an advantage (45:31 - 45:36)
what we&#39;re saying though is when two (45:34 - 45:38)
people are on equal footing and one (45:36 - 45:41)
person is clearly paying money they have (45:38 - 45:43)
an advantage and that&#39;s all pay to win (45:41 - 45:44)
is right like there&#39;s there&#39;s people (45:43 - 45:46)
throw around like pay to win in Pokemon (45:44 - 45:48)
sleep but what do there&#39;s there&#39;s (45:46 - 45:50)
nothing to win in Pokemon s that&#39;s the (45:48 - 45:52)
other side of it right like how many (45:50 - 45:54)
times before PVP came out did people say (45:52 - 45:56)
Pokemon go was pay to win and it was (45:54 - 45:59)
like no one&#39;s winning anything you&#39;re (45:56 - 46:01)
not actually against another person so (45:59 - 46:04)
you&#39;re not winning something you can&#39;t (46:01 - 46:06)
say something&#39;s paid to win when you&#39;re (46:04 - 46:08)
not actually winning anything right like (46:06 - 46:10)
just because I have augia and you don&#39;t (46:08 - 46:14)
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m like winning yeah now (46:10 - 46:16)
if that Lugia (46:14 - 46:20)
card in Pocket is very good and I have (46:16 - 46:23)
it and you don&#39;t yeah that&#39;s paay a win (46:20 - 46:26)
yeah but like even even as somebody I (46:23 - 46:28)
was gifted I I said this last week I was (46:26 - 46:32)
gifted a a $100 iTunes gift card so I (46:28 - 46:34)
got to open however many more packs than (46:32 - 46:39)
somebody else and I still don&#39;t have a (46:34 - 46:42)
lot of the cards to build a lot of the (46:39 - 46:46)
decks right like I I have the Mewtwo (46:42 - 46:49)
deck right I have whatever people say is (46:46 - 46:51)
the Mewtwo deck and I got very lucky and (46:49 - 46:55)
I pulled two meww right away um and I (46:51 - 47:00)
ran a and and I ran a lot of the uh Apex (46:55 - 47:03)
emblem event with a half built Pikachu (47:00 - 47:06)
deck I won I I think it&#39;s no secret that (47:03 - 47:09)
Pikachu is better than Mewtwo like in (47:06 - 47:11)
Grassroots tournament Pikachu is (47:09 - 47:13)
consistently winning more than meww but (47:11 - 47:16)
that that that that Pikachu deck should (47:13 - 47:19)
have two Pikachu EXs and I only had one (47:16 - 47:22)
and I ran 20 plus wins with just one (47:19 - 47:26)
Pikachu EX if I paid more money and I (47:22 - 47:28)
kept opening more and more packs to (47:26 - 47:31)
eventually get the Pikachu card that&#39;s (47:28 - 47:34)
paid a win because a second Pikachu EX (47:31 - 47:35)
would give me an (47:34 - 47:37)
advantage and see (47:35 - 47:40)
Steve when you&#39;re paying the money and (47:37 - 47:43)
you&#39;re hoping for that Pikachu EX but (47:40 - 47:47)
it&#39;s not coming up it&#39;s very frustrating (47:43 - 47:49)
I totally understand your point now now (47:47 - 47:51)
there is luck right you could be a total (47:49 - 47:53)
free to-play player and just happen to (47:51 - 47:56)
pull two gav Wars and two meww that (47:53 - 47:58)
would be crazy lucky in like a one week (47:56 - 48:01)
period to pull all those cards yeah but (47:58 - 48:02)
but again that doesn&#39;t discredit the (48:01 - 48:06)
gamees not pay to win no totally is as (48:02 - 48:08)
pay to win as other games that&#39;s super (48:06 - 48:13)
hard to say like especially since um (48:08 - 48:15)
like once trading gets introduced like (48:13 - 48:17)
and we don&#39;t know how that&#39;s going to (48:15 - 48:20)
work like yeah does that lower like the (48:17 - 48:21)
pay like it will still be pay to win (48:20 - 48:24)
don&#39;t get me wrong but like if Hannah (48:21 - 48:27)
has like every card for what is (48:24 - 48:30)
considered the top meta Pikachu deck and (48:27 - 48:33)
she&#39;s missing you know a Zapdos EX and I (48:30 - 48:36)
have three of them and I just traded to (48:33 - 48:38)
her that would be cool like that would (48:36 - 48:40)
be that would that would prevent Hannah (48:38 - 48:41)
from (48:40 - 48:44)
spending yeah it will also allow people (48:41 - 48:46)
to buy trades on (48:44 - 48:48)
eBay which is undoubtedly going to (48:46 - 48:50)
happen but I mean then that happens now (48:48 - 48:53)
with other games right that happens with (48:50 - 48:54)
go that happens (48:53 - 48:59)
with to go I guess and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s (48:54 - 49:00)
not like this isn&#39;t like a pocket (48:59 - 49:03)
problem this is just all tcgs have this (49:00 - 49:05)
problem where some cards are in demand (49:03 - 49:08)
and you either go to TCG player and you (49:05 - 49:10)
buy that card outright or you have a (49:08 - 49:12)
friend who has it and you borrow it or (49:10 - 49:14)
you go to Target and you buy a bunch of (49:12 - 49:16)
booster packs and hope you pull it (49:14 - 49:17)
that&#39;s the wrong way to do that though (49:16 - 49:19)
don&#39;t you&#39;re better off just buying the (49:17 - 49:22)
card that is very true I I will say I (49:19 - 49:23)
they it&#39;ll be interesting to see how (49:22 - 49:26)
they Implement trading because are they (49:23 - 49:28)
going to you use another currency of (49:26 - 49:30)
some kind are they going to have a (49:28 - 49:32)
cooldown period where you can only trade (49:30 - 49:35)
so much with a specific person or so (49:32 - 49:37)
many times do they have to be you know I (49:35 - 49:38)
mean they don&#39;t have like friendship (49:37 - 49:40)
levels at this point in the game but you (49:38 - 49:42)
know they they can implement it in so (49:40 - 49:45)
many different ways that could cut down (49:42 - 49:47)
on that like Hannah you were saying like (49:45 - 49:48)
the ability to buy like those things (49:47 - 49:50)
will still happen they always still (49:48 - 49:51)
happen right there&#39;s always people that (49:50 - 49:54)
get around the the rules and I mean (49:51 - 49:55)
they&#39;re literally breaking the rules (49:54 - 49:58)
when you&#39;re like Buy in a trade I&#39;m sure (49:55 - 49:59)
there&#39;s a terms of service where they&#39;re (49:58 - 50:00)
like you&#39;re not supposed to pay you know (49:59 - 50:02)
just like in Pokemon go you&#39;re not (50:00 - 50:05)
supposed to pay for Pokemon that you&#39;re (50:02 - 50:06)
being traded there&#39;s always something (50:05 - 50:10)
going on there right um but it will be (50:06 - 50:11)
interesting to see how they implement it (50:10 - 50:14)
because with the amount of currencies in (50:11 - 50:15)
this game I&#39;m going to guess there&#39;s (50:14 - 50:17)
gonna be a trade currency I think I (50:15 - 50:18)
think the trade currency is already in (50:17 - 50:21)
the game I think it&#39;s shine (50:18 - 50:24)
dust really cuz right now okay so this (50:21 - 50:26)
is why I think this is why I think that (50:24 - 50:28)
right now shines is only for flares (50:26 - 50:32)
uhhuh but why I wish were better yes (50:28 - 50:34)
they&#39;re they&#39;re not great no but you&#39;re (50:32 - 50:39)
getting shine dust from the Apex (50:34 - 50:39)
event you&#39;re just getting so much shine (50:39 - 50:45)
dust and there&#39;s (50:41 - 50:45)
like I just like you have you have your (50:46 - 50:50)
pack currency right like when you open (50:48 - 50:51)
packs you can like use that currency to (50:50 - 50:54)
make new cards um but that&#39;s kind of (50:51 - 50:57)
like their not very good pity system but (50:54 - 50:59)
like I understand why they exist but I (50:57 - 51:03)
have so much shine dust and as a as a (50:59 - 51:06)
player I have zero I like I just don&#39;t (51:03 - 51:09)
care about flare at this point (51:06 - 51:12)
and it could be so much better like (51:09 - 51:14)
that&#39;s could I mentioned Marvel snap a (51:12 - 51:16)
little bit last week Marvel snap does (51:14 - 51:21)
the flare pretty darn well in TCG pocket (51:16 - 51:22)
I (51:21 - 51:27)
I&#39;ve you never see it for one on your (51:22 - 51:30)
cards you have to go into so many menus (51:27 - 51:33)
to even just see the flare to begin with (51:30 - 51:35)
and then for another it&#39;s (51:33 - 51:37)
just you can&#39;t use it and they don&#39;t (51:35 - 51:40)
look good they really need to yeah you (51:37 - 51:42)
can see it on a display board yeah so (51:40 - 51:44)
like if you put it on a display board (51:42 - 51:47)
you can see it fairly easily there but (51:44 - 51:50)
that&#39;s really it other than shine dust (51:47 - 51:53)
is the thing we&#39;re getting a lot of yeah (51:50 - 51:54)
it&#39;s the thing that you can exchange (51:53 - 51:57)
tickets for in the Wonder event as well (51:54 - 52:00)
this point that&#39;s true so if if I&#39;m (51:57 - 52:04)
thinking of a player who is like I&#39;m (52:00 - 52:06)
going to have 20 phones and 20 accounts (52:04 - 52:08)
and I&#39;m going to get two booster packs a (52:06 - 52:09)
day which is 40 booster packs a day (52:08 - 52:12)
versus me who&#39;s only getting two booster (52:09 - 52:14)
packs a day and once trading comes out (52:12 - 52:16)
I&#39;ll be able to all my free booster (52:14 - 52:18)
packs 40 a day I&#39;ll be able to trade all (52:16 - 52:22)
of them to one game you need a currency (52:18 - 52:24)
to stop that from (52:22 - 52:28)
happening and shine dust seems the most (52:24 - 52:31)
similar to Stardust and Pokemon go which (52:28 - 52:34)
say what you will about Niantic but like (52:31 - 52:38)
it does it does put a wrench in some (52:34 - 52:41)
people not all people&#39;s like multiac (52:38 - 52:44)
account (52:41 - 52:49)
thing um and like I don&#39;t know how else (52:44 - 52:51)
you would like I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;re (52:49 - 52:53)
just going to add another currency on (52:51 - 52:54)
top of that and where is that currency (52:53 - 52:57)
going to come from like opening packs (52:54 - 52:59)
yeah I mean I don&#39;t know and that would (52:57 - 53:01)
be nice if it was the shine dust and (52:59 - 53:02)
it&#39;s just something that&#39;s already there (53:01 - 53:04)
and we&#39;re not like having to be (53:02 - 53:07)
introduced to a new currency because (53:04 - 53:08)
like like we already know there are so (53:07 - 53:11)
many in this game and to your point (53:08 - 53:12)
we&#39;re getting a lot of shine dust and (53:11 - 53:15)
then the thing is is that even with all (53:12 - 53:18)
that shine dust like you can&#39;t get the (53:15 - 53:20)
flare that easily right because you have (53:18 - 53:24)
to have like a certain amount of (53:20 - 53:28)
cards right so like you have to have (53:24 - 53:29)
what is it like to get just like normal (53:28 - 53:31)
flare you have to have you have to give (53:29 - 53:33)
in a card you have to like trade in a (53:31 - 53:35)
card but you still have to have two (53:33 - 53:38)
remaining yeah at least I think I think (53:35 - 53:40)
it varies per card yeah it varies per (53:38 - 53:42)
card for sure but it is there&#39;s more to (53:40 - 53:44)
it you can&#39;t just have one card and add (53:42 - 53:46)
flare to it so the ratio of like shine (53:44 - 53:48)
dust we&#39;re getting to how many cards (53:46 - 53:49)
people are going to be able to put flare (53:48 - 53:53)
on is not proportionate at all so it (53:49 - 53:54)
would make sense if that was going to (53:53 - 53:56)
end up being used for something else as (53:54 - 53:58)
well (53:56 - 53:58)
yeah I I think it&#39;s going to be shine (54:00 - 54:04)
dust I I do wonder if there will be a (54:01 - 54:05)
like friendship (54:04 - 54:08)
system like even when I was in New York (54:05 - 54:09)
and they were like you know trading&#39;s (54:08 - 54:13)
going to come soon like when trading (54:09 - 54:14)
does eventually come I think they&#39;ll (54:13 - 54:16)
make a big deal about it I think it will (54:14 - 54:18)
be a big update and it will there will (54:16 - 54:21)
be people who did this Lapras event (54:18 - 54:23)
don&#39;t care about the Apex event kind of (54:21 - 54:24)
fell off because two booster packs was (54:23 - 54:26)
not enough to like keep them engaged and (54:24 - 54:29)
then and trading is like this big thing (54:26 - 54:30)
to be like okay come back to the game (54:29 - 54:33)
and and everything yeah (54:30 - 54:36)
um there&#39;s just like no way they&#39;re (54:33 - 54:38)
going to be like trading&#39;s here trade as (54:36 - 54:40)
much as you want with anyone you want (54:38 - 54:42)
over the like there has to be some there (54:40 - 54:44)
has to be like you can only do like one (54:42 - 54:47)
special trade a day or you also have to (54:44 - 54:50)
do shine D or we&#39;re introducing a level (54:47 - 54:52)
system where to be I don&#39;t mind it in (54:50 - 54:56)
Pokemon go where it&#39;s like one day is is (54:52 - 54:58)
is one star or one heart and then seven (54:56 - 55:01)
days is two hearts and then 30 days is (54:58 - 55:03)
is three hearts and like the more Hearts (55:01 - 55:05)
you get the cheaper it is eventually (55:03 - 55:06)
when you trade what I really want is (55:05 - 55:09)
lucky cards let us get to best friends (55:06 - 55:11)
and then give us a 1% chance where if I (55:09 - 55:14)
trade Bobby maybe that maybe that card (55:11 - 55:15)
goes lucky and it&#39;s (55:14 - 55:20)
like I think the go system for trading (55:15 - 55:22)
is I actually like it a lot like you&#39;re (55:20 - 55:24)
saying the one thing I think that they (55:22 - 55:27)
need to do is all is ADD distance to the (55:24 - 55:29)
go trading honestly like we&#39;ve made so (55:27 - 55:32)
many friends especially since like 2020 (55:29 - 55:34)
we&#39;ve made so many friends like through (55:32 - 55:36)
online forums and online communities and (55:34 - 55:38)
they&#39;re all over the place and now I&#39;m (55:36 - 55:40)
lucky friends with a whole list of (55:38 - 55:42)
people and go and I have never going to (55:40 - 55:44)
be able to actually be close enough to (55:42 - 55:46)
them to trade them anything and at this (55:44 - 55:49)
point in time I think there are enough (55:46 - 55:52)
things in place to where hey if people (55:49 - 55:55)
are going to distance trade and cheat in (55:52 - 55:57)
some way to do that like going to do it (55:55 - 55:59)
but they&#39;re already doing it in some (55:57 - 56:02)
form so it&#39;s like I think you could (55:59 - 56:04)
remove the distance stuff at some point (56:02 - 56:05)
in time or maybe at least at least for (56:04 - 56:07)
Lucky friends at least for Lucky friends (56:05 - 56:10)
or at least in like just certain time (56:07 - 56:12)
periods where you&#39;re like hey this week (56:10 - 56:14)
maybe don&#39;t have to make a big like and (56:12 - 56:15)
they&#39;ve done an event like that before (56:14 - 56:18)
very briefly back in 2020 but was it was (56:15 - 56:20)
it like there was not no distance right (56:18 - 56:22)
it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t worldwide it was (56:20 - 56:25)
just like double or triple the distance (56:22 - 56:27)
that you usually can yeah (56:25 - 56:28)
far it was like I could trade with (56:27 - 56:31)
anyone in the entire Milwaukee area (56:28 - 56:33)
which is very like Milwaukee was very (56:31 - 56:36)
big yeah it was definitely I remember (56:33 - 56:37)
trading with people that were like a (56:36 - 56:39)
good 30 or 40 miles away from me and it (56:37 - 56:42)
was that was pretty cool but that needs (56:39 - 56:47)
to go in some way but so I (56:42 - 56:49)
hope with (56:47 - 56:53)
pocket that there&#39;s not a distance thing (56:49 - 56:54)
to it in some way I really do hope that (56:53 - 56:57)
it&#39;s like cuz we&#39;re already batt ing (56:54 - 56:59)
people all over the world and then (56:57 - 57:00)
you&#39;re able to like friend request them (56:59 - 57:03)
after the battle to become friends with (57:00 - 57:05)
them and things like that I so I do hope (57:03 - 57:07)
and you&#39;re way to turn that off it&#39;s the (57:05 - 57:09)
worst part about that entire game every (57:07 - 57:10)
time I battle somebody they&#39;re sending (57:09 - 57:12)
me a friend request and I&#39;m like okay (57:10 - 57:16)
popular I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want it man but (57:12 - 57:17)
we&#39;re already wonder picking from (57:16 - 57:19)
people&#39;s packs that are all over the (57:17 - 57:20)
world as well right because you know (57:19 - 57:22)
it&#39;s like if your friends are opening (57:20 - 57:24)
packs and you can Wonder pick from their (57:22 - 57:26)
pack so I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be I (57:24 - 57:27)
don&#39;t I I hope there&#39;s no distance thing (57:26 - 57:29)
when it comes to trading but I do agree (57:27 - 57:32)
that like yeah they&#39;re never just going (57:29 - 57:35)
to be like trade all you want and just (57:32 - 57:36)
did say that like you don&#39;t have to be (57:35 - 57:38)
standing next to the person to trade (57:36 - 57:40)
right but they were very that answer (57:38 - 57:41)
that they gave was very like you don&#39;t (57:40 - 57:43)
have to be standing right next to the (57:41 - 57:45)
person doesn&#39;t mean that I can be in a (57:43 - 57:47)
different you need your Wonder pick to (57:45 - 57:49)
be at full (57:47 - 57:49)
energy you need 100,000 shine dust gosh (57:50 - 58:01)
yeah um yeah I I am very impressed with (57:57 - 58:05)
the amount of events that pocket has (58:01 - 58:09)
done and I think if I remember Hannah (58:05 - 58:10)
saying it almost feels a little (58:09 - 58:13)
overwhelming but to me like not in like (58:10 - 58:15)
a bad way it&#39;s just like oh there&#39;s (58:13 - 58:17)
things to do like I like I didn&#39;t think (58:15 - 58:20)
I&#39;d be able to sit on stream and stream (58:17 - 58:23)
this game for four hours two nights in a (58:20 - 58:25)
row I I I legitimately didn&#39;t because (58:23 - 58:26)
like who wants to just see see like (58:25 - 58:28)
random battles against people with like (58:26 - 58:31)
no Stakes like that&#39;s like that&#39;s just (58:28 - 58:33)
like not a huge thing on Twitch like (58:31 - 58:35)
usually twitch is very like when you are (58:33 - 58:37)
gaming you&#39;re either either you&#39;re (58:35 - 58:38)
you&#39;re just being funny or you&#39;re (58:37 - 58:40)
relatively good at the game that&#39;s like (58:38 - 58:42)
what&#39;s going to attract people and (58:40 - 58:44)
there&#39;s only so much you can do (58:42 - 58:46)
specifically in my case I&#39;m just (58:44 - 58:48)
speaking as me to be like well we can do (58:46 - 58:51)
four hours of pack opening (58:48 - 58:54)
one maybe that&#39;s good content for four (58:51 - 58:58)
hours that&#39;s expensive cont for 4 hours (58:54 - 59:00)
uh cuz I can I can rip through $100 in (58:58 - 59:02)
about 30 minutes uh so I don&#39;t know (59:00 - 59:07)
about 4 hours of pack opening um but (59:02 - 59:11)
the because the Apex emblem event has a (59:07 - 59:15)
goal right and pay to win or not pay to (59:11 - 59:19)
win people want to figure out how to (59:15 - 59:21)
achieve that as fast as possible so it&#39;s (59:19 - 59:23)
like how I want to see what you&#39;re (59:21 - 59:26)
playing I want to see how you&#39;re playing (59:23 - 59:27)
because I just want to get 45 wins I (59:26 - 59:30)
don&#39;t want to do it in 90 games I don&#39;t (59:27 - 59:32)
want to do it in 100 games I want to do (59:30 - 59:34)
it in as few games as (59:32 - 59:37)
possible and that&#39;s where you know (59:34 - 59:38)
people tune in because they&#39;re like what (59:37 - 59:41)
deck are you using is is this getting (59:38 - 59:43)
you more wins than losses do I have the (59:41 - 59:45)
cards to build this deck I don&#39;t have (59:43 - 59:48)
those cards what would you suggest (59:45 - 59:51)
so that&#39;s that&#39;s so interesting because (59:48 - 59:53)
that&#39;s not my like the way that I feel (59:51 - 59:57)
about it like I don&#39;t I&#39;m not trying to (59:53 - 60:00)
I mean sure I would like to get the 45 (59:57 - 60:02)
wins as quick as possible but not (60:00 - 60:04)
because not because I wanted as quick as (60:02 - 60:06)
possible because because I want to win (60:04 - 60:09)
more than lose right like I want I&#39;m (60:06 - 60:12)
playing to win the game like but I&#39;m (60:09 - 60:14)
just having fun doing the battles over (60:12 - 60:16)
and over again with like the versus (60:14 - 60:18)
battles too and just seeing the (60:16 - 60:20)
different stuff and sure like there (60:18 - 60:22)
isn&#39;t a huge variety of decks like (60:20 - 60:23)
saying earlier like how many times have (60:22 - 60:26)
I come across a meww ex deck like it has (60:23 - 60:28)
happen quite often for some reason they (60:26 - 60:30)
always have two immersive cards as well (60:28 - 60:32)
uh (60:30 - 60:36)
but you know like it is fun to play it (60:32 - 60:38)
because even though and I guess it (60:36 - 60:40)
depends on the deck you&#39;re playing but (60:38 - 60:43)
like for me playing a deck that is like (60:40 - 60:46)
heavily dependent on coin flips it does (60:43 - 60:47)
make every match a little bit different (60:46 - 60:50)
and that to me is exciting like it just (60:47 - 60:53)
like that fact that like I&#39;m not I&#39;m not (60:50 - 60:55)
as like confident that this is going to (60:53 - 60:57)
work EXA the same way this time as it (60:55 - 61:00)
did last time because coin flips change (60:57 - 61:05)
everything and uh they sure do yes they (61:00 - 61:08)
do and you know if um that makes it a (61:05 - 61:09)
little bit more exciting to me also it (61:08 - 61:11)
like makes it more annoying when you (61:09 - 61:13)
know like you keep flipping Tails but (61:11 - 61:15)
that&#39;s part of like doing that that&#39;s (61:13 - 61:18)
part of playing that game to me um but (61:15 - 61:21)
also like just being able to swap out (61:18 - 61:23)
decks try different things like sure (61:21 - 61:25)
there are the Decks that are going to be (61:23 - 61:27)
the best there&#39;s the meta decks but then (61:25 - 61:29)
you&#39;re also coming across like hey but (61:27 - 61:31)
you can use this deck to play against (61:29 - 61:33)
this or it you know it feels good to (61:31 - 61:34)
like play against a meta deck that&#39;s (61:33 - 61:36)
really good and then you&#39;re playing a (61:34 - 61:37)
different kind of deck that like works (61:36 - 61:40)
really well against it and it feels good (61:37 - 61:41)
to like play that and then realize that (61:40 - 61:42)
that&#39;s a good deck I don&#39;t know there&#39;s (61:41 - 61:45)
all those different options in playing (61:42 - 61:47)
the game and obviously if you like come (61:45 - 61:49)
from playing the TCG you know this right (61:47 - 61:51)
like you were saying like new set comes (61:49 - 61:53)
out everybody&#39;s excited for a month they (61:51 - 61:56)
kind of get into their like the set they (61:53 - 61:58)
want to use and then they kind of drop (61:56 - 61:59)
off a little bit and then by Third month (61:58 - 62:01)
you&#39;re like waiting for that next set (61:59 - 62:02)
and that&#39;s fine yeah um and that&#39;s where (62:01 - 62:05)
I think like the CPU like events can (62:02 - 62:08)
come in and kind of keep that (62:05 - 62:11)
from happening too much on the pocket (62:08 - 62:13)
side right like they can put in these (62:11 - 62:15)
CPU events that are just different types (62:13 - 62:16)
so now you&#39;re forced to go build a (62:15 - 62:18)
different kind of deck even out of the (62:16 - 62:20)
same set that we&#39;ve had for the last (62:18 - 62:22)
couple of months um especially adding (62:20 - 62:24)
those Promos in too like all of a sudden (62:22 - 62:27)
lap CX is like at Play it wasn&#39;t a week (62:24 - 62:29)
ago even though there&#39;s not a new set (62:27 - 62:31)
like that promo is now there and makes a (62:29 - 62:33)
new deck like I was going to say like we (62:31 - 62:36)
we had a pretty solid like your your (62:33 - 62:38)
your deck Choice was either was either (62:36 - 62:41)
coin flipping Marowak Pikachu EX Mewtwo (62:38 - 62:45)
EX or uh Articuno like those were kind (62:41 - 62:47)
of the four decks and then because of (62:45 - 62:50)
one single card Mankey the Mankey promo (62:47 - 62:52)
we are now seeing prime a decks pop up (62:50 - 62:55)
because the promo Mankey was (62:52 - 62:58)
significantly better than the first (62:55 - 63:01)
Mankey that you got from the Apex packs (62:58 - 63:03)
right so and we&#39;re probably going to see (63:01 - 63:06)
this again uh whenever the Jigglypuff (63:03 - 63:07)
promo comes out because we already know (63:06 - 63:09)
what all the promos are like all the (63:07 - 63:11)
promos are not in the game but of course (63:09 - 63:13)
the game&#39;s been out and people looked at (63:11 - 63:14)
it so we we know what like I how many (63:13 - 63:16)
promos are there like 26 or something (63:14 - 63:19)
yeah something like that yeah so we we (63:16 - 63:20)
have like half the promos at this point (63:19 - 63:23)
because the Lapras event added the five (63:20 - 63:26)
more so whatever the next event is (63:23 - 63:27)
eventually there will be a Jigglypuff (63:26 - 63:29)
promo and apparently just like the (63:27 - 63:32)
Mankey this Jigglypuff is better than (63:29 - 63:34)
the current Jigglypuff and for somebody (63:32 - 63:37)
who like has never played the TCG you&#39;re (63:34 - 63:39)
like why would two jiggly why would the (63:37 - 63:42)
jigglypuffs be so different it would be (63:39 - 63:44)
like as simple as like what its move is (63:42 - 63:48)
um but there&#39;s also things like retreat (63:44 - 63:49)
so I don&#39;t know what the current (63:48 - 63:50)
Jigglypuff is but if the current (63:49 - 63:51)
Jigglypuff is two Retreat and the new (63:50 - 63:55)
Jigglypuff is kind of garbage but the (63:51 - 63:57)
retreat is one less that&#39;s significantly (63:55 - 63:59)
better just having one Retreat over two (63:57 - 64:02)
also it can be something as simple as HP (63:59 - 64:04)
so if like one Pokemon is like you have (64:02 - 64:06)
a shins at 40 HP but a new Shinx comes (64:04 - 64:10)
out and has 50 HP like that 10 extra HP (64:06 - 64:12)
can make Shinx instantly more viable I (64:10 - 64:13)
don&#39;t think there are any shins in the (64:12 - 64:16)
game I was just using that as an (64:13 - 64:20)
example yeah so we I&#39;ve already seen (64:16 - 64:23)
like people being like Oh Wiggly tough (64:20 - 64:25)
maybe we can get Wiggly tough to work (64:23 - 64:26)
which is like cool (64:25 - 64:29)
but I think you will see more Wiggly (64:26 - 64:31)
tough when that new jiggly puff comes (64:29 - 64:34)
out because prime a has been there since (64:31 - 64:37)
day one but the Mankey before it was bad (64:34 - 64:40)
and this this new Mankey is good so now (64:37 - 64:43)
you&#39;re seeing primeape pop up yeah and I (64:40 - 64:45)
also think like the addition of uh (64:43 - 64:47)
because very few cards right now have (64:45 - 64:49)
abilities but I could see more of those (64:47 - 64:52)
popping up in in time and like I think (64:49 - 64:53)
that will definitely change things as (64:52 - 64:55)
well I think abilities definitely change (64:53 - 64:57)
change the game up and (64:55 - 64:59)
um just even if a promo has an ability (64:57 - 65:02)
when like the regular one doesn&#39;t that (64:59 - 65:04)
could change everything about that card (65:02 - 65:06)
and what it evolves into so you know I (65:04 - 65:09)
think I think they&#39;re able to make small (65:06 - 65:12)
changes that can have effects that will (65:09 - 65:16)
that can do a lot to the game and again (65:12 - 65:18)
just outside of the versus battling (65:16 - 65:20)
which again I really enjoy especially (65:18 - 65:22)
because you&#39;re just seeing some (65:20 - 65:24)
differences and then you just can know (65:22 - 65:25)
like you can kind of see like okay this (65:24 - 65:27)
is how plays like maybe I&#39;ll tweak this (65:25 - 65:31)
or do this and just make a change um but (65:27 - 65:32)
also those those CPU battles I think (65:31 - 65:34)
will be kind of crucial to keep those (65:32 - 65:36)
going and not like not make them like (65:34 - 65:38)
once per set or something definitely (65:36 - 65:41)
like get a couple in there so that (65:38 - 65:44)
people are able to switch stuff up and (65:41 - 65:45)
not keep using the same stuff over and (65:44 - 65:47)
over because again like with the Lapras (65:45 - 65:50)
event Pikachu EX 25 times right like (65:47 - 65:52)
until you need to complete the tasks (65:50 - 65:55)
that are build a deck with the one two (65:52 - 65:57)
and three diamond cards only yeah (65:55 - 65:59)
definitely but that&#39;s you need you kind (65:57 - 66:01)
of need two decks each of these but you (65:59 - 66:04)
only have to do that once for that task (66:01 - 66:05)
but then you have to beat lapers 20 (66:04 - 66:06)
times and it&#39;s like okay well now I&#39;m (66:05 - 66:08)
going to go back to I have confirmed you (66:06 - 66:10)
can do with Auto (66:08 - 66:11)
[Music] (66:10 - 66:14)
Battle on the on the hardest difficulty (66:11 - 66:16)
yes on the expert (66:14 - 66:18)
left let me get that deck list real (66:16 - 66:21)
quick it&#39;s just it&#39;s the lieutenant (66:18 - 66:26)
surge rental deck nice very nice um yeah (66:21 - 66:28)
I think (66:26 - 66:30)
uh for the sake of this conversation not (66:28 - 66:32)
going too long I do want to talk about (66:30 - 66:33)
like the different decks and how the (66:32 - 66:36)
battles actually feel especially since (66:33 - 66:37)
Hannah has gotten into battles but I (66:36 - 66:39)
think we&#39;ll save that conversation for (66:37 - 66:42)
next week which we&#39;ll technically be (66:39 - 66:44)
tomorrow but you guys won&#39;t know that (66:42 - 66:46)
that will be tomorrow because we could (66:44 - 66:48)
literally have like a three-h hour (66:46 - 66:50)
episode on pocket but also I have to (66:48 - 66:52)
edit three different episodes before I (66:50 - 66:54)
leave on Tuesday so we&#39;re G have to (66:52 - 66:56)
break it up for you um let&#39;s take a (66:54 - 66:57)
quick break and when we come back we got (66:56 - 67:00)
some scarlet and violet news so we will (66:57 - 67:03)
see you on the other side and we are (67:00 - 67:06)
back from our break we got some scarlet (67:03 - 67:07)
and violet (67:06 - 67:11)
news that it&#39;s it&#39;s time it (67:07 - 67:15)
happened I have been waiting all year (67:11 - 67:16)
for (67:15 - 67:19)
this people didn&#39;t believe (67:16 - 67:22)
me and here we (67:19 - 67:26)
are history has been made today (67:22 - 67:27)
although it probably wasn&#39;t supposed to (67:26 - 67:30)
be announced but yeah that&#39;s the (67:27 - 67:33)
thing (67:30 - 67:37)
oops darn you Japanese grocery (67:33 - 67:37)
stores uh Shiny Rayquaza will we coming (67:39 - 67:45)
to taror raid battles from December 20th (67:42 - 67:48)
to January 6 globally well this is off (67:45 - 67:50)
sby I don&#39;t know why it wouldn&#39;t be (67:48 - 67:52)
globally like in what world would they (67:50 - 67:56)
be like no only Japanese switches would (67:52 - 67:59)
be able to get this quaza well they&#39;re (67:56 - 68:00)
definitely going to see the anime (67:59 - 68:03)
episodes that are relevant to it (68:00 - 68:07)
first yeah yeah that&#39;s true true um I (68:03 - 68:09)
definitely there&#39;s no secret I believe (68:07 - 68:11)
that Shiny Rayquaza was coming the (68:09 - 68:13)
entire time (68:11 - 68:17)
and I felt like if you (68:13 - 68:20)
watched a handful of episodes the anime (68:17 - 68:23)
you would instantly agree with why I (68:20 - 68:27)
thought this like they mhm (68:23 - 68:30)
like I think it&#39;s like Netflix did like (68:27 - 68:31)
the what the first like 10 episodes and (68:30 - 68:34)
I think it&#39;s like episode eight I think (68:31 - 68:36)
so it&#39;s definitely in the very first (68:34 - 68:38)
group yeah where they&#39;re they literally (68:36 - 68:41)
set up against a Raid Battle so we don&#39;t (68:38 - 68:43)
know a whole lot because (68:41 - 68:45)
technically it&#39;s shouldn&#39;t have been (68:43 - 68:47)
announced yet uh the reason it&#39;s (68:45 - 68:48)
announced is because of a different (68:47 - 68:51)
event which we&#39;ll talk about uh but to (68:48 - 68:53)
get the Rayquaza stuff out of the way we (68:51 - 68:54)
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s seven star we don&#39;t (68:53 - 68:56)
know if it&#39;s mighty mark (68:54 - 68:58)
there were some people saying like are (68:56 - 69:01)
we even going to be able to catch this (68:58 - 69:03)
um and I guess to be fair we don&#39;t know (69:01 - 69:05)
that answer but I don&#39;t know why we (69:03 - 69:08)
wouldn&#39;t be able to catch this it&#39;s the (69:05 - 69:10)
game has been out for two years we have (69:08 - 69:11)
been able to catch every single Raid (69:10 - 69:13)
Battle up to this point probably just (69:11 - 69:15)
sword and shield feeling the sword and (69:13 - 69:18)
shield kind of those times yeah but like (69:15 - 69:21)
the reason we couldn&#39;t catch U or glri (69:18 - 69:25)
or Spectre or Mewtwo or Zer Ora was (69:21 - 69:27)
because the game wasn&#39;t set up that way (69:25 - 69:29)
you could either catch as many as you (69:27 - 69:33)
want or catch none and like this game (69:29 - 69:35)
specifically has you can catch one we (69:33 - 69:37)
read the data you can no longer catch (69:35 - 69:40)
anymore I&#39;m not saying that your logic (69:37 - 69:43)
isn&#39;t like good I&#39;m saying that like (69:40 - 69:45)
people get the memories of well there (69:43 - 69:47)
was a time when something came and I (69:45 - 69:49)
wasn&#39;t able to catch it like right this (69:47 - 69:51)
era or the last memories of a totally (69:49 - 69:53)
different game though yeah well people (69:51 - 69:54)
remember those memories that especially (69:53 - 69:56)
if they were negative to they&#39;re going (69:54 - 69:59)
to remember it more than the (69:56 - 70:00)
positive (69:59 - 70:03)
um I also don&#39;t see why this wouldn&#39;t be (70:00 - 70:06)
a sevenstar raid I guess the logic would (70:03 - 70:09)
be well Diga and palia were five star (70:06 - 70:12)
raids that my first thought like just (70:09 - 70:13)
because of that that I could see people (70:12 - 70:16)
thinking that but there&#39;s no way this (70:13 - 70:18)
isn&#39;t a sevenstar raid how many (70:16 - 70:20)
legendaries have been sevenstar raids (70:18 - 70:21)
just one just (70:20 - 70:24)
Mewtwo yeah so we&#39;ve just had Mewtwo (70:21 - 70:26)
being seven star and then we had Diaga (70:24 - 70:28)
Palkia and Le (70:26 - 70:32)
let&#39;s be fair here the Diaga and Palkia (70:28 - 70:34)
was kind of weird it was really weird (70:32 - 70:36)
and they haven&#39;t done anything like it (70:34 - 70:37)
since yeah right they were like we&#39;re (70:36 - 70:39)
putting because that was that was when (70:37 - 70:43)
the DLC dropped right and they were like (70:39 - 70:45)
here&#39;s the new DLC hey we brought back a (70:43 - 70:47)
lot of Legends we didn&#39;t bring back (70:45 - 70:50)
Diaga Palkia but they&#39;re in the game (70:47 - 70:53)
also they&#39;re just in five star raids and (70:50 - 70:57)
you can catch one of each (70:53 - 70:57)
like it feels weird because there&#39;s been (70:59 - 71:03)
nothing like that like if they were to (71:01 - 71:05)
say like landus Tornadus Thundurus and (71:03 - 71:07)
anamoros are coming to raids because (71:05 - 71:10)
they are in the game but just not (71:07 - 71:13)
catchable but you would realistically (71:10 - 71:14)
want them for like (71:13 - 71:17)
competitive like that also like I I I do (71:14 - 71:20)
think that should happen (71:17 - 71:24)
and like I I guess I&#39;m a Believer and (71:20 - 71:27)
like eventually we&#39;ll get an Amorous (71:24 - 71:29)
event will (71:27 - 71:32)
we I don&#39;t (71:29 - 71:35)
know like it would it would still be (71:32 - 71:39)
very we weird after two years to be like (71:35 - 71:41)
the only way to get an Amorous is to (71:39 - 71:44)
play through this 40h hour game and yet (71:41 - 71:47)
catch her and yet here we are you could (71:44 - 71:50)
in Pokemon go very Valentine&#39;s Day yes (71:47 - 71:52)
the Valentine&#39;s Day where my apartment (71:50 - 71:55)
building caught on fire I think I know (71:52 - 71:58)
what they&#39;re doing this Valentine&#39;s (71:55 - 72:01)
day but if you&#39;re lucky if you&#39;re lucky (71:58 - 72:04)
trainers um hold on yeah I mean they (72:01 - 72:06)
they did set up a system which I think (72:04 - 72:08)
is a very good system which is like here (72:06 - 72:10)
are Raid event specifics and you can (72:08 - 72:11)
only catch one and if you want to do it (72:10 - 72:13)
over and over you can get rewards and (72:11 - 72:14)
you can help people I think that system (72:13 - 72:17)
is great the system is inherently flawed (72:14 - 72:20)
because of the frame rate of the game (72:17 - 72:22)
sure like no one&#39;s disagreeing there but (72:20 - 72:25)
like the core concept of the system is (72:22 - 72:26)
very good (72:25 - 72:30)
yeah did okay two things one walking (72:26 - 72:32)
wake iron (72:30 - 72:35)
leaves same way as like padago right (72:32 - 72:36)
there was only there&#39;s only the five (72:35 - 72:38)
star ones from the raids that you could (72:36 - 72:40)
only catch one of yep oh yeah right you (72:38 - 72:42)
could only catch one of each right yeah (72:40 - 72:43)
mhm okay and they&#39;ve done that one three (72:42 - 72:46)
times now right well technically (72:43 - 72:50)
four one of those it was broken yeah (72:46 - 72:54)
right right uh but with DGA (72:50 - 72:56)
palia what time when was that when did (72:54 - 73:00)
the DLC come out like what month was (72:56 - 73:03)
that what was that September I think it (73:00 - 73:07)
was it was Indigo dis oh right so it was (73:03 - 73:09)
like okay I was just wondering if it was (73:07 - 73:12)
any combination with like ho like not (73:09 - 73:15)
hoen with H cotor or something so they (73:12 - 73:17)
wanted to like I see I see because go (73:15 - 73:19)
had like Diaga and palia and all their (73:17 - 73:21)
stuff happening for a period of time if (73:19 - 73:24)
maybe they were just trying to like you (73:21 - 73:25)
know how they like associate things with (73:24 - 73:27)
different games and and everything but (73:25 - 73:29)
if it was September then that had (73:27 - 73:32)
nothing to do with with any other game I (73:29 - 73:34)
that&#39;s just weird that&#39;s still weird to (73:32 - 73:35)
me that&#39;s still very weird to me that (73:34 - 73:37)
like they&#39;re the only legendaries that (73:35 - 73:42)
they did that with and they&#39;ve never (73:37 - 73:44)
I I did (73:42 - 73:46)
like Pokemon day probably would have (73:44 - 73:50)
been my guess for Shiny Rayquaza as as a (73:46 - 73:53)
Christmas thing I think that&#39;s fine I do (73:50 - 73:55)
I do feel bad for people who will be (73:53 - 73:58)
getting this game for Christmas like (73:55 - 74:01)
does go after Christmas though it does (73:58 - 74:04)
go after the holiday yeah January 6 um (74:01 - 74:05)
and it&#39;s (74:04 - 74:07)
it&#39;s I don&#39;t want to say like it&#39;s (74:05 - 74:10)
really easy just to borrow a Pokemon but (74:07 - 74:13)
ideally if you are needing to do this (74:10 - 74:17)
with meww meww is very much dependent on (74:13 - 74:19)
a decent team like everyone kind of (74:17 - 74:21)
needed to know what they were doing so (74:19 - 74:23)
like if somebody was to you know come to (74:21 - 74:26)
our slack or our Discord or my twitch (74:23 - 74:27)
streams and be like hey I just got the (74:26 - 74:30)
game loving it frame rate sucks (74:27 - 74:32)
understand buddy uh but then was like (74:30 - 74:36)
Hey I I don&#39;t have enough resources to (74:32 - 74:39)
like be a contributor to the four people (74:36 - 74:42)
it would be very easy to be like hey (74:39 - 74:45)
borrow this Pokemon get your Rayquaza (74:42 - 74:46)
and then you can just trade it back to (74:45 - 74:48)
me when you&#39;re done I think that&#39;s (74:46 - 74:51)
probably like in the the universe of (74:48 - 74:53)
like what is the perfect Pokemon (74:51 - 74:55)
scenario I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what game freak (74:53 - 74:57)
like has written on their whiteboard (74:55 - 74:58)
well like oh brand new trainers will be (74:57 - 74:59)
able to connect and trade and then (74:58 - 75:01)
they&#39;ll be able to help each other I&#39;m (74:59 - 75:03)
sure that&#39;s like in their mind of like (75:01 - 75:04)
yeah that&#39;s how we want people to play (75:03 - 75:07)
our game um (75:04 - 75:10)
so I think it will be Mighty Mark I (75:07 - 75:11)
think you&#39;ll be able to catch it I think (75:10 - 75:14)
it will you can catch one I think it (75:11 - 75:17)
will be as hard as Mewtwo I think I I&#39;ll (75:14 - 75:19)
do a video for it I&#39;ll we don&#39;t know (75:17 - 75:23)
what its terot type is I I will say that (75:19 - 75:26)
Mr Joe caby said that (75:23 - 75:29)
no current raids can be programmed to be (75:26 - 75:31)
Stellar terot (75:29 - 75:34)
type um so you (75:31 - 75:38)
can&#39;t so they would have to possibly (75:34 - 75:41)
update or change something of the game I (75:38 - 75:42)
don&#39;t know what the validate on that I&#39;m (75:41 - 75:45)
not saying I don&#39;t trust Joe I I didn&#39;t (75:42 - 75:48)
know that until I saw them tweet said (75:45 - 75:52)
thing um we as far as the anime knows we (75:48 - 75:55)
don&#39;t know what Ray qu&#39;s type Stellar or (75:52 - 75:58)
terot type is right that&#39;s what I was (75:55 - 75:59)
GNA ask I was G to say like well what (75:58 - 76:00)
was (75:59 - 76:03)
anime we don&#39;t know I mean like unless (76:00 - 76:04)
Hannah wants to disagree with me it (76:03 - 76:07)
looks like it&#39;s Stellar type in the (76:04 - 76:10)
anime I don&#39;t I&#39;m I&#39;m a little behind on (76:07 - 76:12)
the anime I need to catch up before this (76:10 - 76:15)
event but even that first battle the (76:12 - 76:18)
first battle the way it&#39;s shining yeah (76:15 - 76:22)
it looks star yeah it (76:18 - 76:22)
does yeah I I I would assume we will get (76:23 - 76:28)
a proper announcement ahead of time like (76:27 - 76:31)
Mewtwo saying what its type is (76:28 - 76:37)
and actually has a not a great move set (76:31 - 76:40)
but it&#39;s a very popular Pokemon yeah it (76:37 - 76:42)
is it is it&#39;s a very good Pokemon and (76:40 - 76:44)
the shiny is a fantastic shiny so this (76:42 - 76:48)
is a good event yeah it it is I mean (76:44 - 76:50)
everybody should everybody should join (76:48 - 76:52)
your slack or your Discord so that they (76:50 - 76:53)
can get help so they can get this (76:52 - 76:56)
Rayquaza by the way (76:53 - 77:00)
yeah uh so so the reason we know about (76:56 - 77:02)
this Rayquaza is because there&#39;s a new (77:00 - 77:04)
event starting in Japan and it&#39;s very (77:02 - 77:05)
similar to an event that already (77:04 - 77:07)
happened so we kind of know how this (77:05 - 77:09)
will play out it&#39;s called the mythical (77:07 - 77:12)
Pokemon get campaign and it will um give (77:09 - 77:14)
out three mythical Pokemon so this year (77:12 - 77:19)
it is going to be Deoxys CIO and um (77:14 - 77:21)
zarude and these Pokemon already exist (77:19 - 77:22)
in scarlet and violet just like Diaga (77:21 - 77:25)
and Palkia you can currently move them (77:22 - 77:27)
in they just they&#39;re just not catchable (77:25 - 77:30)
in the game so if if you&#39;re thinking (77:27 - 77:32)
there&#39;s going to be like a third DLC or (77:30 - 77:33)
a pokedex (77:32 - 77:35)
upgrade there you could already move (77:33 - 77:38)
these Pokemon in that&#39;s not (77:35 - 77:40)
happening I think we&#39;ve established (77:38 - 77:42)
epilog means they&#39;re (77:40 - 77:45)
done the whole point of the word (77:42 - 77:46)
epilog (77:45 - 77:51)
um so it&#39;s a point campaign and if you (77:46 - 77:54)
remember this is a very cohesive podcast (77:51 - 77:55)
if you remember earlier we said pay to (77:54 - 78:00)
win um so ideally when you buy Pokemon (77:55 - 78:03)
cards in Japan inside those packs will (78:00 - 78:06)
be points I think a pack of cards is (78:03 - 78:09)
four points and then you go to a (78:06 - 78:11)
Japanese website and you enter the (78:09 - 78:13)
little code card in and then you make a (78:11 - 78:15)
profile and there will be multiple (78:13 - 78:18)
rewards you can get and it&#39;s like it&#39;ll (78:15 - 78:20)
it&#39;ll be something like Kio is four (78:18 - 78:25)
points Deoxys is 10 points zarude is 20 (78:20 - 78:27)
points and then there will be like (78:25 - 78:29)
master ball and some other stuff I don&#39;t (78:27 - 78:31)
know if there&#39;ll be master ball or (78:29 - 78:32)
Safari Ball or stuff this year but (78:31 - 78:36)
usually it goes over the limit because (78:32 - 78:38)
ultimately you could just buy one (78:36 - 78:41)
booster box in Japan which how many (78:38 - 78:44)
packs of cards is that Bobby 30 so yeah (78:41 - 78:47)
30 30 times four that almost gives you (78:44 - 78:49)
enough points to just get everything off (78:47 - 78:53)
the list the other thing you can do is (78:49 - 78:55)
certain stores so I think three years (78:53 - 78:56)
ago when they did this for sword and (78:55 - 79:00)
shield it was um marshadow Genesect (78:56 - 79:02)
Volcanion I think were the three Pokemon (79:00 - 79:06)
s yeah and uh you could go into like (79:02 - 79:08)
7-Eleven and if you bought (79:06 - 79:11)
like like a Pokemon egg roll or (79:08 - 79:15)
something it would be like two (79:11 - 79:20)
points it&#39;s just much easier uh so as as (79:15 - 79:22)
an American we have a lot of Americans (79:20 - 79:24)
as a Canadian as somebody from the UK (79:22 - 79:27)
you could technically participate you (79:24 - 79:30)
could order a box of whatever set this (79:27 - 79:32)
is going to be in I don&#39;t know if we (79:30 - 79:33)
know the set it&#39;s probably going to be (79:32 - 79:35)
that EV set i&#39;m G to Guess that Japanese (79:33 - 79:39)
EV set when does it start it starts uh (79:35 - 79:42)
November 22nd okay the EV set comes out (79:39 - 79:46)
December 6th okay so it wouldn&#39;t be (79:42 - 79:48)
that well I guess it could could it (79:46 - 79:50)
could be because you could go to the (79:48 - 79:51)
grocery you could go to 7-Eleven to (79:50 - 79:53)
start getting your points that yeah (79:51 - 79:55)
because that&#39;s the only set that&#39;s (79:53 - 79:57)
coming out I mean there&#39;s no other set (79:55 - 80:01)
coming out before December 6th to my (79:57 - 80:05)
knowledge yeah and cab doesn&#39;t say what (80:01 - 80:08)
cards these will be attached to when (80:05 - 80:09)
they were for the sword and shield era (80:08 - 80:11)
it was the shiny set it was attached to (80:09 - 80:13)
I don&#39;t remember what set that was oh (80:11 - 80:15)
then it&#39;s probably going to be because (80:13 - 80:19)
this is the same this is the (80:15 - 80:23)
same uh as this Chinese set like this is (80:19 - 80:24)
it&#39;s like you know what I&#39;m trying to (80:23 - 80:25)
say like it&#39;s the same (80:24 - 80:27)
time frame it&#39;s the I think it&#39;s a high (80:25 - 80:29)
class set like it&#39;s the same so in that (80:27 - 80:32)
case there would be probably 10 packs in (80:29 - 80:35)
a booster box not 30 ah yes yes yes (80:32 - 80:37)
because I remember buying I think three (80:35 - 80:39)
or four at the time and having extra (80:37 - 80:43)
codes left over yeah yeah what was it (80:39 - 80:45)
like shiny shiny vsar or something was (80:43 - 80:48)
the the set shiny star shiny star V (80:45 - 80:51)
shiny shiny star V Chinese something (80:48 - 80:56)
v um look this up now okay so so that is (80:51 - 80:58)
how that&#39;s happening again you hear the (80:56 - 81:01)
pay to win I mean you&#39;re I don&#39;t know (80:58 - 81:03)
when you buy a box of cereal and there&#39;s (81:01 - 81:05)
a toy in it do you call the toy in the (81:03 - 81:07)
cereal pay to win like you&#39;re buying (81:05 - 81:09)
Pokemon cards or you&#39;re buying like an (81:07 - 81:11)
egg roll and you&#39;re just getting (81:09 - 81:14)
points like I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re (81:11 - 81:16)
really winning by getting a free (81:14 - 81:20)
Deoxys was was was the other mythicals (81:16 - 81:22)
it was last year just last year no it (81:20 - 81:25)
three years ago it was yeah yeah cuz I (81:22 - 81:27)
check I made a YouTube video about it (81:25 - 81:30)
and I checked that video and it was (81:27 - 81:32)
three it was three years ago I made that (81:30 - 81:33)
video it&#39;s been a little while at this (81:32 - 81:38)
point okay wow really yeah where&#39;s time (81:33 - 81:41)
gone I&#39;ve moved like seven times since (81:38 - 81:42)
then (81:41 - 81:44)
Bobby if you&#39;re W if you&#39;re listening to (81:42 - 81:45)
the audio version Hannah&#39;s in a (81:44 - 81:47)
completely different place this time too (81:45 - 81:50)
no thankfully (81:47 - 81:54)
not um wow okay it&#39;s going to take me (81:50 - 81:57)
another second here to figure that out (81:54 - 81:59)
um now I know people are like Japan gets (81:57 - 82:01)
all the good (81:59 - 82:05)
stuff that&#39;s true that that&#39;s very fair (82:01 - 82:10)
to say um Korea got the same event with (82:05 - 82:13)
points uh in their Korean packs it was (82:10 - 82:16)
much easier for a US person to just go (82:13 - 82:19)
to the Japanese website make an account (82:16 - 82:20)
have Google translate it enter the (82:19 - 82:22)
points yourself so what I&#39;m saying is (82:20 - 82:27)
you can order Japanese CS cards from uh (82:22 - 82:28)
Mecca (82:27 - 82:32)
or gosh play Asia or wherever you&#39;re (82:28 - 82:35)
ordering japanese cards from somebody on (82:32 - 82:36)
Tik Tok I&#39;m sure they&#39;re selling you (82:35 - 82:38)
japanese cards you can order your cards (82:36 - 82:41)
from wherever and the code cards will be (82:38 - 82:43)
in there I&#39;ll make a video whenever that (82:41 - 82:46)
comes out of like how to make an account (82:43 - 82:47)
how to redeem the code cards all that (82:46 - 82:50)
stuff so it&#39;s not region lock to Japan (82:47 - 82:52)
although the point system is for (82:50 - 82:54)
Japanese products Korea was a little bit (82:52 - 82:56)
harder cu (82:54 - 82:58)
they you had to use like a VPN at that (82:56 - 83:00)
point some people know how to use a VPN (82:58 - 83:01)
because of pocket so maybe that won&#39;t be (83:00 - 83:07)
that hard for them uh these did come to (83:01 - 83:11)
Europe and to the United States via game (83:07 - 83:14)
or GameStop not as exciting although you (83:11 - 83:16)
didn&#39;t have to buy anything you did have (83:14 - 83:19)
to walk into a GameStop which I would (83:16 - 83:21)
rather buy Pokemon cards than talk to a (83:19 - 83:25)
GameStop employee personally ouch (83:21 - 83:28)
yeah that&#39;s uh fair I usually when I&#39;m (83:25 - 83:29)
talking to a GameStop employee it&#39;s (83:28 - 83:31)
because I&#39;m buying Pokemon cards (83:29 - 83:34)
so no I&#39;ve very nice GameStop employees (83:31 - 83:36)
but I know they&#39;re GameStop as a company (83:34 - 83:39)
is just not very good yeah true that&#39;s (83:36 - 83:43)
true um okay if it was if it was in (83:39 - 83:45)
December of 2020 it was shining star V (83:43 - 83:47)
if it was in December of it was 2020 (83:45 - 83:50)
December of 2020 okay yeah shiny star V (83:47 - 83:51)
yeah that sounds right because those (83:50 - 83:54)
were like black boxes I remember yes (83:51 - 83:56)
yeah yeah (83:54 - 83:59)
um so yeah because we so ultimately we (83:56 - 84:01)
know that both of these events are (83:59 - 84:04)
coming because pamphlets or little (84:01 - 84:07)
brochures went out to Japanese stores (84:04 - 84:08)
probably shouldn&#39;t have been opened (84:07 - 84:10)
somebody opened them somebody took a (84:08 - 84:13)
picture they&#39;re on SB now it really (84:10 - 84:15)
feels like the old Kora Kora days yeah (84:13 - 84:18)
it really does this was Thursday right (84:15 - 84:19)
like this happened like two days ago 3 (84:18 - 84:20)
days ago (84:19 - 84:23)
maybe yeah it happened pretty recently (84:20 - 84:24)
so I&#39;m thinking we were probably (84:23 - 84:25)
supposed to get an announcement like (84:24 - 84:28)
this coming week if they were shipped to (84:25 - 84:30)
the stuff last week oh yeah like a week (84:28 - 84:31)
or two yeah I&#39;m sure these were going to (84:30 - 84:33)
be handed out during like Black Friday (84:31 - 84:35)
or right this I don&#39;t know if Japan (84:33 - 84:37)
actually does Japan celebrate Black (84:35 - 84:39)
Friday they must the whole world gets (84:37 - 84:42)
online discounts I&#39;m sure from yeah for (84:39 - 84:44)
Black Friday I don&#39;t actually I don&#39;t (84:42 - 84:47)
it&#39;s very much an online if the videos (84:44 - 84:49)
mean anything that we&#39;ve seen year after (84:47 - 84:51)
year they all happen to be in America (84:49 - 84:55)
where the yeah no the the videos the the (84:51 - 84:58)
holiday the way that it is celebrated if (84:55 - 85:00)
you can say it that way is definitely an (84:58 - 85:02)
American thing but online I feel like (85:00 - 85:04)
they&#39;re discounts probably in a lot of (85:02 - 85:07)
places yeah everywhere regardless people (85:04 - 85:09)
like Black Friday or not in Japan people (85:07 - 85:11)
are going to do more shopping for the (85:09 - 85:14)
holidays correct therefore pamphlets (85:11 - 85:16)
will be handed out to them for the (85:14 - 85:18)
holidays to advertise both of these (85:16 - 85:23)
events um I guess that leads to we (85:18 - 85:25)
know we&#39;re recording this on November (85:23 - 85:28)
9th we know that Rayquaza is taking up (85:25 - 85:30)
almost three weeks at the end of the (85:28 - 85:35)
year uh of content we still have one (85:30 - 85:38)
sevenstar starter left which would be (85:35 - 85:42)
tort Tera uh no clue they probably just (85:38 - 85:43)
do ground type right we have we&#39;ve only (85:42 - 85:45)
had one ground I don&#39;t know what else (85:43 - 85:47)
you would really do for torta at that (85:45 - 85:49)
point yeah I would have thought grass (85:47 - 85:51)
but then they (85:49 - 85:55)
did Superior grass yeah Superior was p (85:51 - 85:57)
so then probably yeah maybe ground (85:55 - 85:58)
ground something I feel like you bring (85:57 - 86:00)
ground because then people bring water (85:58 - 86:02)
but then you have the grass super (86:00 - 86:03)
effective that&#39;s (86:02 - 86:05)
true (86:03 - 86:09)
um anyways we we so we would assume that (86:05 - 86:13)
torter would some point happen between (86:09 - 86:15)
now knowing my luck we&#39;ll put this up on (86:13 - 86:17)
Monday and it will already be announced (86:15 - 86:21)
uh of course now to (86:17 - 86:24)
Rayquaza but because Eevee Day is coming (86:21 - 86:26)
up I would not be surprised if they (86:24 - 86:30)
recycle the sevenstar Eevee yeah which (86:26 - 86:32)
yeah would be like a slight bummer to (86:30 - 86:34)
people that are like I already got Eevee (86:32 - 86:36)
but you have to think that Eevee would (86:34 - 86:38)
come back with Urban mystica and I don&#39;t (86:36 - 86:40)
care what anyone says Eevee was the (86:38 - 86:43)
easiest sevenstar raid for a group or (86:40 - 86:46)
for like a solo person and the Eevee (86:43 - 86:49)
outbreaks are so much fun oh yeah they (86:46 - 86:51)
partnered that with the Eevee outbreaks (86:49 - 86:54)
so I I definitely see them doing Eevee (86:51 - 86:56)
they could fit Eevee and torta in before (86:54 - 86:58)
Rayquaza I don&#39;t think they can fit (86:56 - 87:03)
anything more yeah yeah I do think that (86:58 - 87:06)
they might go Eevee first though because (87:03 - 87:08)
I think so too okay yeah because I was (87:06 - 87:11)
gonna say like Eevee day is the 21st (87:08 - 87:13)
right so that&#39;s literally two weeks (87:11 - 87:15)
that&#39;s like two weeks from now so I (87:13 - 87:16)
think they&#39;d maybe like skip next (87:15 - 87:20)
weekend yeah and then um do Eevee on the (87:16 - 87:22)
23rd and the 30th would they do two (87:20 - 87:24)
weeks of it probably do they I think (87:22 - 87:26)
they do one week V oh just one week okay (87:24 - 87:28)
so they do it on the 23rd I think that&#39;s (87:26 - 87:29)
what they did the first time right it (87:28 - 87:31)
was only one week yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t (87:29 - 87:33)
remember okay so I could see them doing (87:31 - 87:34)
like the 2 oh because eveve day is (87:33 - 87:36)
actually on the day they would start it (87:34 - 87:39)
anyway yep so started on the 21st which (87:36 - 87:42)
would be like the 22 UTC and then go (87:39 - 87:43)
through that weekend and then they could (87:42 - 87:44)
do tort (87:43 - 87:48)
Tera after I&#39;m sure Eevee outbreaks will (87:44 - 87:49)
happen alongside (87:48 - 87:53)
it EV what the the outbreaks oh the (87:49 - 87:56)
outbreaks yeah yeah I&#39;m sure do that um (87:53 - 87:57)
the only other thing I can think of is (87:56 - 87:59)
like well what happens when they&#39;re done (87:57 - 88:01)
with seven five seven star raids like (87:59 - 88:04)
well they have Rayquaza which I think is (88:01 - 88:06)
a good way to end all your starters (88:04 - 88:08)
right because we&#39;re going to be out of (88:06 - 88:10)
starters by the time Rayquaza comes (88:08 - 88:11)
unless for whatever reason tort Tera (88:10 - 88:14)
gets pushed uh but we no way no way (88:11 - 88:16)
torta ends up after shiny rqu I don&#39;t (88:14 - 88:19)
think so either uh I could definitely (88:16 - 88:22)
see them doing uh the Gen n starters (88:19 - 88:24)
after it I think that would be really (88:22 - 88:26)
cool I think that would bring people (88:24 - 88:29)
back um obviously not as much as rqua (88:26 - 88:30)
like when when you think of like what (88:29 - 88:33)
brings people back like Mewtwo just huge (88:30 - 88:36)
D like Mew is so popular and like rqua (88:33 - 88:38)
equally as popular as meww you just put (88:36 - 88:41)
the shiny Factor on to it I do Wonder (88:38 - 88:43)
though now that we&#39;re all done with all (88:41 - 88:46)
the starters do we see like we&#39;re (88:43 - 88:49)
putting wo Chen or something in raids (88:46 - 88:52)
and they&#39;re shiny the reason I say that (88:49 - 88:55)
is not to like get people&#39;s hope up or (88:52 - 88:59)
whatever is just because the catch one (88:55 - 89:01)
thing has been established in this game (88:59 - 89:04)
and in the past we got the gallerian (89:01 - 89:07)
birds Zapdos mtrace and Articuno through (89:04 - 89:09)
competitive all you had to do was do (89:07 - 89:13)
three matches and then you get it I (89:09 - 89:15)
think I don&#39;t want to say like earning a (89:13 - 89:17)
Pokemon I think it is just more (89:15 - 89:21)
impactful to do a Raid Battle for said (89:17 - 89:25)
Shiny Pokemon whether that&#39;s w Chen or (89:21 - 89:29)
coridon or Rayquaza to be like I took (89:25 - 89:31)
down this epic Pokemon with my three (89:29 - 89:33)
friends versus I built a team of (89:31 - 89:37)
Igglybuff Wiggly tough uh ccch and I (89:33 - 89:38)
lost three battles and then I got a (89:37 - 89:40)
shiny zaptos I think when you put those (89:38 - 89:43)
two on like a like a comparison of like (89:40 - 89:44)
what is more (89:43 - 89:46)
memorable I think the Raid Battle is a (89:44 - 89:47)
little more memorable that&#39;s just the (89:46 - 89:50)
way you do it every few years I know to (89:47 - 89:52)
get my rattatas out so that I can get my (89:50 - 89:56)
shiny legendary Pokemon (89:52 - 89:58)
that (89:56 - 89:58)
explosion yeah I mean like we is it is (89:58 - 90:05)
it is the first week of November I don&#39;t (90:02 - 90:07)
think we&#39;re getting any Za news I think (90:05 - 90:10)
I think this confirms the Rayquaza I (90:07 - 90:12)
mean confirms (90:10 - 90:15)
that this is the year no no no January (90:12 - 90:19)
28th Za release date I don&#39;t think so I (90:15 - 90:22)
don&#39;t think so there were there were (90:19 - 90:23)
there were three things I was confident (90:22 - 90:26)
about at the of the year one we were not (90:23 - 90:29)
getting Za this year two Shiny Rayquaza (90:26 - 90:32)
will come and three I didn&#39;t think they (90:29 - 90:35)
would reuse the word Legends I was only (90:32 - 90:38)
wrong on one of those three oh yeah I (90:35 - 90:42)
was so confident of a January Rel St for (90:38 - 90:44)
yeah wanted it I still think let&#39;s go (90:42 - 90:47)
Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee is a Legends game (90:44 - 90:50)
but I can&#39;t confirm that until we see (90:47 - 90:53)
Za got to learn what a Legends game (90:50 - 90:55)
actually is we will we will find out cuz (90:53 - 90:57)
we will have three Legends games at that (90:55 - 91:00)
point po right now we only have two and (90:57 - 91:02)
they&#39;re very similar people just don&#39;t (91:00 - 91:05)
realize how similar they are I am very (91:02 - 91:06)
excited to make that YouTube (91:05 - 91:09)
[Laughter] (91:06 - 91:10)
video (91:09 - 91:14)

the future I&#39;ll be in the future so that (91:25 - 91:28)
you guys will be in the past so if you (91:27 - 91:31)
want to see Fukuoka Japan what the wild (91:28 - 91:33)
area is I should be streaming that on (91:31 - 91:36)
Twitch um the I just I bring that up (91:33 - 91:37)
because like the live streams are like a (91:36 - 91:39)
lot of work and I got to carry a (91:37 - 91:41)
backpack and you guys are very heavy (91:39 - 91:42)

so I do appreciate when people show up (91:46 - 91:50)
for the live streams they are very good (91:48 - 91:53)
streams though it is fun to watch like (91:50 - 91:54)
you know watch you&#39;re playing Pokemon go (91:53 - 91:57)
but to actually see where you are to (91:54 - 91:59)
like see a new place you know it is it (91:57 - 92:02)
is very cool to to watch those streams (91:59 - 92:04)
so excited to see I always have to find (92:02 - 92:06)
like an old Japanese lady to trade with (92:04 - 92:08)
because then a line will start forming (92:06 - 92:10)
and they&#39;ll be like this white guy must (92:08 - 92:13)
have all the good (92:10 - 92:13)
Pokemon my like my stream in Korea where (92:15 - 92:19)
like I was like I&#39;ll just trade with (92:18 - 92:21)
this like one Korean kid they just like (92:19 - 92:24)
want a Char Cadet and instant regret cuz (92:21 - 92:25)
as soon as I started trading with them I (92:24 - 92:28)
had like a line of like all these other (92:25 - 92:30)
and like these Korean kid I can&#39;t (92:28 - 92:32)
understand you (92:30 - 92:36)

know uh those are always fun moments (92:38 - 92:41)
though I love I love trading with other (92:40 - 92:46)
people um but yeah uh and then we should (92:41 - 92:48)
have some other episodes for you guys if (92:46 - 92:50)
if there is like crazy breaking news I (92:48 - 92:51)
really I really don&#39;t think so in the (92:50 - 92:53)
next two weeks I think the Rayquaza (92:51 - 92:54)
probably would have been the the (92:53 - 92:55)
breaking news but we got that pretty (92:54 - 92:57)
early I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s (92:55 - 92:58)
going to be shocked when sevenstar Tor (92:57 - 93:01)
Tera gets announced or if Eevee day gets (92:58 - 93:03)
announced or anything (93:01 - 93:07)
so I think we&#39;re pretty safe there um (93:03 - 93:09)
cool uh thank you Hannah thank you Bobby (93:07 - 93:11)
