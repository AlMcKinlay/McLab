neighbors who just happened to be the (4:07 - 4:11)

imaginary stops once she heard what I (4:22 - 4:26)

neighbor who ended up calling the police (4:26 - 4:31)
went around to apologize and offered a (4:28 - 4:33)
pokemon cake with the words sorry we (4:31 - 4:35)
called the cops on you written on the (4:33 - 4:40)

pleased to know that the neighbor stood (4:40 - 4:44)
ten feet back to deliver the package (4:41 - 4:45)

Pokemon go live.com a remote Wraith (5:16 - 5:23)
celebration oh I keep forgetting that (5:20 - 5:27)
started let's celebrate me too uh the (5:23 - 5:29)
ability that we added a new feature (5:27 - 5:31)
there's been a lot of weird free stuff (5:29 - 5:34)
going on with Pokemon go lately that's (5:31 - 5:36)
causing Meeks some issues they are doing (5:34 - 5:37)
a lot of cool things (5:36 - 5:40)
why is he causing you issues it's free (5:37 - 5:42)
yes or is it making your game go gunky (5:40 - 5:45)
well okay because alright let's get into (5:42 - 5:47)
it I mean I (5:45 - 5:51)
since Steve solved all my problems I did (5:47 - 5:56)
and now ride my bike and collect gifts (5:51 - 5:58)
to send out to everybody in the world (5:56 - 6:01)
which they appreciate all the way from (5:58 - 6:05)
the UK to Japan and then I open gifts (6:01 - 6:06)
every morning from everybody because (6:05 - 6:08)
that's pretty much how I play pokemon go (6:06 - 6:12)
send gifts receive gifts I literally I (6:08 - 6:17)
am not joking three days ago I deleted (6:12 - 6:20)
every pokeball that I had pokeball great (6:17 - 6:23)
ball Ultra Ball do though you never (6:20 - 6:25)
delete ultra balls well I certainly did (6:23 - 6:29)
hi cuz I never used them I deleted every (6:25 - 6:33)
potion super potion hyper potion max (6:29 - 6:35)
potion every single one I'm talking (6:33 - 6:38)
hundreds here hundreds deleted every (6:35 - 6:41)
berry that wasn't silver golden this (6:38 - 6:43)
morning I'm opening gifts from my dear (6:41 - 6:47)
cherished precious friends and it said (6:43 - 6:52)
your bag is full and I went and I looked (6:47 - 6:58)
to manage items I had 708 pokeballs (6:52 - 7:05)
where did 708 pokeballs come (6:58 - 7:10)
in three days without me spending a cent (7:05 - 7:13)
so when you open gifts now and spin (7:10 - 7:15)
stops it gives you like a ridiculous (7:13 - 7:20)
amount of pokeballs be nice because (7:15 - 7:22)
nobody's out there right because they me (7:20 - 7:24)
antic wants it so if you do go out or (7:22 - 7:27)
you do receive gifts that you can use (7:24 - 7:29)
those pokeballs to catch at home without (7:27 - 7:31)
worrying about like well I can only (7:29 - 7:32)
catch you know for Pokemon cuz I only (7:31 - 7:35)
got twenty pokeballs it's just a ploy (7:32 - 7:37)
for me to pay more money to maximize my (7:35 - 7:39)
back space I know what's going on oh (7:37 - 7:42)
that's probably true too I mean I don't (7:39 - 7:43)
know I don't think anyone's disagreeing (7:42 - 7:45)
with that but if you have those remote (7:43 - 7:47)
ray passes which is now available we (7:45 - 7:49)
talked about this maybe a month ago of (7:47 - 7:51)
how they were gonna do this how it was (7:49 - 7:53)
gonna work it's working it's in the game (7:51 - 7:57)

still be able to do raids for gallery' (19:11 - 19:16)

and darbuka into the glaring forms (19:32 - 19:37)
Pokemon originally discovered in the you (19:35 - 19:39)
know very gentle (19:37 - 19:41)
more frequently in the wild pretty big (19:39 - 19:44)
events I mean shiny Dunsparce and that's (19:41 - 19:49)
all you had to say for a great man now (19:44 - 19:53)
you got to do it I I mean like (19:49 - 19:55)
how do I want to wear this it is cool (19:53 - 20:00)
that remote raids exist and that right (19:55 - 20:03)
now currently you have full power when (20:00 - 20:06)
you're in a remote raid whereas in the (20:03 - 20:09)
future you'll have have your power will (20:06 - 20:12)
be halved if you join a remote raid but (20:09 - 20:15)
besides like sitting at home or maybe I (20:12 - 20:18)
guess sitting at the office you're (20:15 - 20:20)
really not going to need to remote raid (20:18 - 20:22)
I guess like if it was nice out and if (20:20 - 20:24)
it was safe outside I would just walk to (20:22 - 20:26)
the raid but I guess there could be a (20:24 - 20:29)
time where like somehow I can't get to (20:26 - 20:31)
the raid or I see that our people are in (20:29 - 20:33)
it so I'll just join it cuz I can't walk (20:31 - 20:35)
there in ten minutes and they're (20:33 - 20:36)
probably already starting problem is (20:35 - 20:39)
it's the attractive nuisance problem (20:36 - 20:42)
it's like we know that if you were to (20:39 - 20:44)
walk to a raid and it's kind of like (20:42 - 20:46)
when I ride my bike it's the same thing (20:44 - 20:48)
if you were to walk to a raid you (20:46 - 20:52)
wouldn't go near anyone number one (20:48 - 20:53)
because you're you and number two (20:52 - 20:55)
because you know you're not supposed to (20:53 - 20:59)
be near anybody but other people just (20:55 - 21:02)
are very careless about that and Niantic (20:59 - 21:03)
doesn't want to take the blame (21:02 - 21:07)
sure oh that's why they're really (21:03 - 21:09)
pushing the whole remote raid thing and (21:07 - 21:11)
they're gonna keep pushing it for a long (21:09 - 21:13)
time no I mean I think it's fine now but (21:11 - 21:14)
I'm just saying like when things open (21:13 - 21:17)
back up it's not going to open that back (21:14 - 21:20)
up that fast right but in like a you say (21:17 - 21:23)
a year like okay a year is your mo (21:20 - 21:26)
trades gonna be still a thing well it (21:23 - 21:28)
all still be a thing but late is it (21:26 - 21:30)
we're spending the dollar to not leave (21:28 - 21:32)
your house to do a Charmander I don't (21:30 - 21:34)
know it will be it's like for people (21:32 - 21:37)
like me I don't I don't even if the raid (21:34 - 21:38)
is at the far corner of my building I (21:37 - 21:41)
don't want to have to get up and put on (21:38 - 21:48)
clothes office they may have a break (21:41 - 21:50)
this may see we're getting to that mate (21:48 - 21:53)
it may take them longer to get there (21:50 - 21:55)
especially since smoke you know most (21:53 - 21:57)
raids you can't get there when it starts (21:55 - 22:00)
you're not getting in on that raid like (21:57 - 22:02)
if you're not there right when it starts (22:00 - 22:05)
five minutes late there's nobody there (22:02 - 22:07)
doing it anymore I mean there isn't (22:05 - 22:11)
there is an attractive aspect of oh hey (22:07 - 22:14)
I can just quick jump in here I'll be at (22:11 - 22:16)
half power but like I'm joining 19 other (22:14 - 22:18)
people it doesn't matter what my (22:16 - 22:20)
strength is right and I still have a (22:18 - 22:22)
chance to capture it and I don't have to (22:20 - 22:24)
try to get off this conference call or (22:22 - 22:27)
rush and try to run there to get there (22:24 - 22:29)
in time like there's an attraction that (22:27 - 22:30)
happens to me every once in a while (22:29 - 22:33)
where I pop it in like oh well I won't (22:30 - 22:35)
make it there by the time everybody else (22:33 - 22:37)
is there but if I had a remote option (22:35 - 22:39)
I'd be like well I'll spend the buck (22:37 - 22:43)
because it's one I don't have and I'll (22:39 - 22:45)
just do it real quick it would be cool (22:43 - 22:48)
if you can do remote raise with friends (22:45 - 22:49)
but that's not a thing I don't know if (22:48 - 22:51)
that'll ever be a thing I mean if your (22:49 - 22:54)
friends are in your house with you but I (22:51 - 22:56)
guess the the argument for remote rating (22:54 - 22:57)
with friends would be the same argument (22:56 - 23:00)
with like let me trade with my lucky (22:57 - 23:02)
friends I have lucky friends within (23:00 - 23:04)
Australia but I have no plans of going (23:02 - 23:07)
to Australia any time soon (23:04 - 23:07)
all right well that's all the Pokemon (23:07 - 23:12)
good news so with that being said we'll (23:09 - 23:13)
take a quick break (23:12 - 23:16)
when we come back we got some TCG news (23:13 - 23:20)
some anime news and some sword and (23:16 - 23:22)
shield news so we will be right back (23:20 - 23:24)
[Music] (23:22 - 23:27)
hey if you're listening to this that (23:24 - 23:29)
means you've made it to the break and it (23:27 - 23:30)
is the start of the month which means I (23:29 - 23:32)
bring up our patreon which you probably (23:30 - 23:34)
heard of you listen to the show first (23:32 - 23:38)
off thank you our 10 year anniversary of (23:34 - 23:40)
it's super effective is coming in July (23:38 - 23:43)
so what we're doing right now is anyone (23:40 - 23:46)
who is already a patreon subscriber or (23:43 - 23:48)
anyone who becomes a patreon subscriber (23:46 - 23:52)
in the month of May will get their name (23:48 - 23:55)
on something special we're doing in July (23:52 - 23:57)
the reason we're doing it now and not (23:55 - 23:59)
closer is because one it gives you an (23:57 - 24:02)
entire month and then at the start of (23:59 - 24:04)
June I can start prepping all that or (24:02 - 24:07)
July so we can get it done on time so (24:04 - 24:09)
really I'm just planning really early (24:07 - 24:12)
for this so if you're already a patreon (24:09 - 24:14)
subscriber you won't have to worry about (24:12 - 24:16)
anything besides just like an update of (24:14 - 24:19)
like what is your final name if you (24:16 - 24:22)
become a patreon subscriber in may get (24:19 - 24:24)
the same treatment so it's pretty much (24:22 - 24:26)
all to celebrate the people who have (24:24 - 24:29)
monetarily supported us whether that's (24:26 - 24:31)
like a dollar a month or five dollars a (24:29 - 24:34)
month or something coming up in July for (24:31 - 24:35)
our 10 year anniversary so it's really (24:34 - 24:37)
exciting I guess you know for two (24:35 - 24:39)
dollars a month you can join our slack (24:37 - 24:42)
community which has over 500 people for (24:39 - 24:43)
$5.00 a month you get access to our (24:42 - 24:46)
anime podcast and there are some other (24:43 - 24:49)
rewards like if you want merch and stuff (24:46 - 24:51)
that starts out like the $25 anyways (24:49 - 24:55)
there's my spiel is CDOT cash if you (24:51 - 24:56)
want to support on patreon or if you (24:55 - 24:59)
want the long handle patreon.com slash (24:56 - 25:05)
it's super effective i TS su p ER e FF e (24:59 - 25:09)
CT IV e i think i did it's super (25:05 - 25:10)
effective correctly I should probably (25:09 - 25:13)
change it to something shorter but is e (25:10 - 25:17)
dot cash way shorter and catchy and if (25:13 - 25:20)
you can't remember any of that it'll be (25:17 - 25:22)
in the podcast description below that's (25:20 - 25:25)
it that's the spiel and he you got the (25:22 - 25:27)

rival destinies episodes adding to (25:51 - 25:58)
Pokemon TV that's about it (25:54 - 26:01)
what what is the character in that (25:58 - 26:04)
because I'm it's it's funny that the (26:01 - 26:06)
title doesn't start with B&W which I (26:04 - 26:10)
thought all of their seasons did hmm (26:06 - 26:12)
black and white rival destinies arriving (26:10 - 26:14)
to Pokemon TV which is the fifteenth (26:12 - 26:17)
season of the Pokemon anime where Ash (26:14 - 26:20)
ends up battling alder the champion of (26:17 - 26:23)
you Nova rival destinies also features (26:20 - 26:27)
thunderous tornado sand Landorus but no (26:23 - 26:29)
n was ending before that or after that I (26:27 - 26:30)
don't remember (26:29 - 26:33)
I think n was a cadet and was at the end (26:30 - 26:35)
and yeah so this was like just the (26:33 - 26:37)
Forgotten season that nobody watched (26:35 - 26:39)
yeah probably (26:37 - 26:42)
is this where when they do ass and I'll (26:39 - 26:45)
community day we all complain and throw (26:42 - 26:46)
her and hands up in the air when they (26:45 - 26:49)
don't put sunglasses on sand I'll I plan (26:46 - 26:53)
on it yeah I was on the elevator in my (26:49 - 26:56)
building and some stranger got on the (26:53 - 26:58)
elevator with me going up and had a (26:56 - 26:59)
squirtle on their bag and I said does (26:58 - 27:01)
your squirtle have sunglasses and they (26:59 - 27:03)
said no and I was like well why are you (27:01 - 27:05)
wasting my time (27:03 - 27:05)
no they said Oh outsider that's right (27:08 - 27:13)
okay yeah (27:11 - 27:15)
something outsider would say both of my (27:13 - 27:20)
masters news full disclosure I am (27:15 - 27:22)
partnered with DNA who makes Pokemon (27:20 - 27:25)
masters this is off Pokemon comm though (27:22 - 27:29)
silver and ho-oh and Wallace and milotic (27:25 - 27:33)
joined battle in Pokemon masters how o (27:29 - 27:36)
comes to pass EO the new legendary event (27:33 - 27:38)
pure hearts and rainbow wings not only (27:36 - 27:39)
stars ho-oh (27:38 - 27:41)
but also the rival trainer from poke em (27:39 - 27:44)
pokemon gold and silver ethan and silver (27:41 - 27:45)
that's how I can tell somebody's not a (27:44 - 27:47)
true pokemon fan because they don't call (27:45 - 27:51)
Ethan by Ethan's name here heart that's (27:47 - 27:53)
my geek keeping for this episode pure (27:51 - 27:55)
hearts and rainbow wings will feature a (27:53 - 27:57)
revamp to legendary events that will (27:55 - 27:59)
continue for all future events collect (27:57 - 28:02)
prize coins to earn special rewards from (27:59 - 28:06)
the prize box you can obtain a area you (28:02 - 28:09)
can obtain area info featuring a new (28:06 - 28:11)
sync pair for silver and ho-oh which is (28:09 - 28:14)
the new event so hope for those that (28:11 - 28:16)
might not be playing Pokemon masters or (28:14 - 28:18)
unsure oh oh is not in the loot boxes (28:16 - 28:21)
you just have to do an event but this (28:18 - 28:23)
event gives you gems and I guess it's a (28:21 - 28:25)
random chance to get ho oh in stead of (28:23 - 28:27)
like guaranteed chance I haven't gotten (28:25 - 28:30)
ho yet but I guess people are I don't (28:27 - 28:31)
know you haven't done this yet either (28:30 - 28:34)
Greg no I haven't started I mean I got I (28:31 - 28:37)
picked my egg and then I was like (28:34 - 28:39)
distracted by something else and that's (28:37 - 28:42)
been my all bye bubble games I get (28:39 - 28:43)
distracted by something else and then I (28:42 - 28:45)
forget to go back but I haven't started (28:43 - 28:47)
it yet so I don't like I haven't seen (28:45 - 28:50)
any of the stuff if you haven't visited (28:47 - 28:52)
passio lately you you won't want to miss (28:50 - 28:54)
the new Pokemon egg you can evolve the (28:52 - 28:56)
egg that will hatch into Bulbasaur (28:54 - 28:57)
Charmander or squirtle after several (28:56 - 29:00)
battles I believe it to be five you can (28:57 - 29:02)
then form a sync pair with that Pokemon (29:00 - 29:03)
and even give it a nickname in the (29:02 - 29:05)
future eggs will allow players to add a (29:03 - 29:07)
variety of Pokemon to their team in (29:05 - 29:09)
addition players can now perform a free (29:07 - 29:12)
daily Scout once a day do I get to pick (29:09 - 29:15)
what my egg hatches into in some manner (29:12 - 29:20)
yeah oh you pick the egg yeah we were (29:15 - 29:22)
debating I think a week or two ago (29:20 - 29:24)
whether these Pokemon would be able to (29:22 - 29:26)
evolve they can evolve (29:24 - 29:28)
DNA told me the difference is these (29:26 - 29:30)
Pokemon don't (29:28 - 29:32)
so like the I guess the question would (29:30 - 29:33)
be like why would you want to get (29:32 - 29:38)
Blastoise when blues future sync pair (29:33 - 29:42)
will have Blastoise just like red as (29:38 - 29:45)
Charizard and DNA said the differences (29:42 - 29:47)
those Pokemon can take advantage of mega (29:45 - 29:51)
evolution these Pokemon and eggs cannot (29:47 - 29:53)
is my friendship not high enough with (29:51 - 29:57)
them how node and it never will be (29:53 - 29:59)
chance to scout and another another (29:57 - 30:03)
incredible pair Wallace is spotlight (29:59 - 30:06)
Wallace and milotic bring their dazzling (30:03 - 30:08)
battle style to Pokemon masters with (30:06 - 30:10)
beautiful tricky attacks like grand (30:08 - 30:13)
illusion and mirror coat on May 1st (30:10 - 30:16)
Cinthia spotlight pokey fair will return (30:13 - 30:19)
in addition to this you were more moral (30:16 - 30:21)
at most more likely be able to scout 5 (30:19 - 30:24)
star sync pairs you will also have the (30:21 - 30:26)
chance to pull the powerful sync pair of (30:24 - 30:29)
Cynthia and Garchomp which I need but I (30:26 - 30:32)
really need Wallace more and they're (30:29 - 30:34)
doing a login so I think there's another (30:32 - 30:37)
return to poke my masters event so if (30:34 - 30:39)
you haven't logged in and more than what (30:37 - 30:43)
is it like 30 days 45 days you get a (30:39 - 30:46)
bunch more gems and then yeah but (30:43 - 30:48)
they're also doing the legendary event (30:46 - 30:49)
which you're getting 300 gems even if (30:48 - 30:51)
you did place yes yes so they're doing (30:49 - 30:55)
the if you haven't played and you just (30:51 - 30:57)
want to stock up on gems you they should (30:55 - 30:59)
have a welcome back campaign for you if (30:57 - 31:00)
you haven't played in more than a month (30:59 - 31:03)
and then if you are continuing playing (31:00 - 31:04)
you should be logging in every day just (31:03 - 31:07)
to collect your 300 gems and do your (31:04 - 31:10)
what's it called the tactics no not the (31:07 - 31:13)
tactics it's called the my bingo card no (31:10 - 31:17)
not your bingo card the daily ie tome (31:13 - 31:20)
login bonus the daily Scout that's what (31:17 - 31:21)
it's called you get a daily Scout that (31:20 - 31:26)
gives you like 10 items man Wallace (31:21 - 31:28)
while since Cynthia are on two different (31:26 - 31:31)
banners I don't understand the concept (31:28 - 31:34)
of a banner a banner is just the like (31:31 - 31:37)
the type of loot box that you're pulling (31:34 - 31:39)
from Paul in a tendency if I get Wallace (31:37 - 31:40)
are we all ready for me to be extremely (31:39 - 31:42)
disappointed yes I'm ready for you to (31:40 - 31:45)
get Wallace (31:42 - 31:45)
so think of the banners like the like (31:45 - 31:52)
when you walk up to a bubblegum machine (31:49 - 31:55)
and this bubblegum machine has like red (31:52 - 31:57)
blue yellow (31:55 - 32:01)
but this bubblegum machine is just (31:57 - 32:01)
spearmint (32:01 - 32:06)
they don't even happen anymore that was (32:01 - 32:09)
the worst Paul I have ever had oh no (32:06 - 32:14)
what did you get I got Bugsy surge (32:09 - 32:20)
Whitney Bryson Seibold Bruno oh why am i (32:14 - 32:21)
blinking in her name Mina (32:20 - 32:27)
Wulfric and another lieutenants urge you (32:21 - 32:33)
garbage service yes yes garbage I had to (32:27 - 32:35)
Cynthia's in a poll one time it's pretty (32:33 - 32:40)
sweet speaking of spending money rebel (32:35 - 32:45)
clash is now available that's about it (32:40 - 32:49)
wasn't the best card in rebel clash is (32:45 - 32:53)
it Sableye boss's orders boss's orders (32:49 - 32:55)
what does that do (32:53 - 32:57)
boss it is Pokemon catcher without the (32:55 - 33:00)
flip oh nice they're bringing that back (32:57 - 33:04)
it was in X&Y it was called Lysander (33:00 - 33:07)
people hated it so back in the day back (33:04 - 33:09)
in the day when wil and I played (33:07 - 33:12)
competitive Pokemon TCG it was during (33:09 - 33:16)
the time of okay mom black in pokemon (33:12 - 33:19)
white we had beautiful sets like (33:16 - 33:25)
emerging powers and plasma storm those (33:19 - 33:27)
are two very bad sets but there was a (33:25 - 33:29)
card there was a trainer collared called (33:27 - 33:33)
Pokemon catcher and you could have four (33:29 - 33:34)
on your deck and you would always have (33:33 - 33:36)
four in your deck and it was a trainer (33:34 - 33:38)
card and you could play as many trainer (33:36 - 33:40)
cards as you want on your turn (33:38 - 33:43)
and if all it did was it said this (33:40 - 33:46)
pokémon on your bench I want to kill it (33:43 - 33:50)
promote it I knock it out I win the game (33:46 - 33:53)
yeah basically and then they said that (33:50 - 33:57)
carts too good we're changing it so now (33:53 - 34:01)
instead of you doing it you got to flip (33:57 - 34:04)
a coin if heads you can do that if tails (34:01 - 34:09)
you've wasted that card 5050 and nobody (34:04 - 34:11)
played it ever again after that well I (34:09 - 34:13)
mean some people still played it but (34:11 - 34:15)
then they came out with a card called (34:13 - 34:18)
Lysander and X&Y after black and white (34:15 - 34:22)
and Lysander was exactly Pokemon catcher (34:18 - 34:24)
you play it you go that pokémon on your (34:22 - 34:26)
bench promote it because I'm gonna knock (34:24 - 34:30)
it out and win the game but they changed (34:26 - 34:32)
it to a supporter card which means you (34:30 - 34:35)
can only play one supporter a turn but (34:32 - 34:38)
it was still very powerful and then they (34:35 - 34:39)
got rid of Lysander and everyone (34:38 - 34:41)
rejoiced in Sun and Moon there was (34:39 - 34:43)
nothing or that although there was a (34:41 - 34:46)
Kuzma which is kind of like that as well (34:43 - 34:49)
but it required both people to flip but (34:46 - 34:51)
there's ways around that as well but (34:49 - 34:55)
they have reprinted Lysander and it's (34:51 - 34:57)
called boss's orders and is the best (34:55 - 35:01)
card I think in the set it is if you (34:57 - 35:05)
pull a normal one it is about ten bucks (35:01 - 35:09)
if you pull a full art one it is about (35:05 - 35:11)
32 dollars and if you pull a rainbow (35:09 - 35:14)
rare one it is about 35 dollars (35:11 - 35:17)
I pulled a hundred and one at digital (35:14 - 35:20)
booster packs last night I saw some of (35:17 - 35:22)
that I pulled this you can narrow lane I (35:20 - 35:25)
can't can't complain I drew giggles not (35:22 - 35:27)
complain uh I pulled zero boss's orders (35:25 - 35:31)
though oh yeah I did you know honey yeah (35:27 - 35:32)
you'll never win (35:31 - 35:34)
he'll never we are what did you get (35:32 - 35:38)
multiples of I got two ADP's which is (35:34 - 35:42)
what is that Arceus dialga Palkia the (35:38 - 35:45)
best card currently in the format I (35:42 - 35:47)
thought boss's orders was the best card (35:45 - 35:49)
no passes orders is the best card in (35:47 - 35:53)
rebel Clara backlash (35:49 - 35:53)
and boss's orders just makes ADP even (35:54 - 35:59)
better (35:58 - 36:03)
what does ADP do uh ATP just does a (35:59 - 36:06)
bunch of really dumb stuff they have (36:03 - 36:10)
unlimited Ray so ATP is about a $30 card (36:06 - 36:15)
for one water one metal and one double (36:10 - 36:18)
on one colorless it does a hundred and (36:15 - 36:20)
fifty damage and you can search in your (36:18 - 36:23)
deck for up to three basic energy cards (36:20 - 36:26)
and attach them to any pokemon the way (36:23 - 36:28)
in any way you would like and you can do (36:26 - 36:29)
that every turn (36:28 - 36:33)
it's week two Fairy guess what pokemon (36:29 - 36:35)
no one's using anymore (36:33 - 36:38)
I thought they rotated fairy out they (36:35 - 36:44)
did as of sword and shield but ADP came (36:38 - 36:47)
from Sun and Moon cosmic eclipse which (36:44 - 36:50)
is still legal it's week two fairy which (36:47 - 36:52)
no one is playing anymore (36:50 - 36:56)
and then ADP has a GX move called (36:52 - 36:59)
altered creation GX for the rest of this (36:56 - 37:00)
game (36:59 - 37:02)
your pokémon attacks do thirty more (37:00 - 37:06)
damage to your bonus Active Pokemon for (37:02 - 37:09)
the rest of the game if this Pokemon has (37:06 - 37:12)
at least one extra water energy on it in (37:09 - 37:15)
addition when your opponent's active (37:12 - 37:17)
pokémon is knocked out you get to take (37:15 - 37:31)
an extra price it's a basic it's a basic (37:17 - 37:33)
it does a hundred and fifty for one (37:31 - 37:35)
water energy and what do that attack no (37:33 - 37:37)
no one water energy one melon one color (37:35 - 37:41)
so it's three energies to do 150 but you (37:37 - 37:42)
can do it every turn and every time you (37:41 - 37:44)
do it you can search in your deck for (37:42 - 37:45)
three more energies and attach them to (37:44 - 37:48)
any other Pokemon in any other way you (37:45 - 37:50)
would like goes really really good with (37:48 - 37:54)
the sash E&V huzzah Shion is now out an (37:50 - 37:59)
altered Cree cache it's so good (37:54 - 37:59)
yeah if you do altered creation GX (38:00 - 38:05)
you're now doing 180 every turn (38:03 - 38:08)
no penalty you're just attaching energy (38:05 - 38:11)
so I pulled two of those cards last (38:08 - 38:13)
night in the digital card game not the (38:11 - 38:17)
not IRL I don't I don't know how they (38:13 - 38:20)
have not thought about banning a DP do (38:17 - 38:23)
they have banned and restricted in (38:20 - 38:25)
Pokemon or they just wait for things to (38:23 - 38:28)
rotate out no they do like reset stamp (38:25 - 38:29)
is banded and expanded right now you (38:28 - 38:31)
can't use reset stamp at all and (38:29 - 38:33)
expanded they banned it what does that (38:31 - 38:36)
do reset stamp forces your opponent to (38:33 - 38:38)
shuffle their hand in their deck and (38:36 - 38:40)
draw four cards but that doesn't seem (38:38 - 38:43)
that bad (38:40 - 38:46)
what anytime your for it like if your (38:43 - 38:47)
important I has seven cards and you (38:46 - 38:48)
bring them down to four cards you know (38:47 - 38:51)
that's good I mean it's good but it's (38:48 - 38:53)
not like bring them down to zero cards (38:51 - 38:56)
well yeah but expanded as a disaster (38:53 - 38:58)
expand to be still playing hypnotoxic (38:56 - 39:01)
laser there you go (38:58 - 39:04)
this was april 27th to stop pokemon calm (39:01 - 39:06)
speaking of TCG they announced the 2021 (39:04 - 39:08)
season now remember we've talked about (39:06 - 39:11)
this a couple weeks ago that the 2020 (39:08 - 39:15)
season is canceled the 2021 worlds will (39:11 - 39:18)
take place in Europe the 2021 season (39:15 - 39:22)
will start in August August 28th will (39:18 - 39:25)
start the 2021 season so anytime worlds (39:22 - 39:27)
happens we get a rotate we rotate it out (39:25 - 39:29)
of you know these cards are no longer (39:27 - 39:34)
legal so they're keeping Sun and Moon (39:29 - 39:36)
team up that's gonna be the oldest set (39:34 - 39:38)
you'll be able to use so if you're (39:36 - 39:40)
walking into a target or a Walmart don't (39:38 - 39:43)
buy oh gosh there's a lot of sudden moon (39:40 - 39:45)
sets well so this is this is what you (39:43 - 39:48)
can buy that will be good all the way (39:45 - 39:55)
until August 2021 guaranteed it's gonna (39:48 - 39:57)
be Sun and Moon team-up detective (39:55 - 39:58)
Pikachu (39:57 - 40:01)
Sun and Moon unbroken bonds Sun and Moon (39:58 - 40:04)
unified Minds hidden faiths which you (40:01 - 40:05)
probably won't even be able to find (40:04 - 40:08)
anyways Sun and Moon cosmic eclipse (40:05 - 40:12)
that's where you would find a DP sword (40:08 - 40:14)
and shield and sword and shield rebel (40:12 - 40:16)
clash so those are all the sets that (40:14 - 40:21)
will be legal starting August 28th 2020 (40:16 - 40:25)
and will go until August of 2021 (40:21 - 40:29)
I would assume come August 2021 they're (40:25 - 40:33)
probably gonna cut team up unbroken bond (40:29 - 40:35)
signified mine and cosmic Eclipse and (40:33 - 40:36)
probably just do base sword and shield (40:35 - 40:38)
at that point but we won't know that (40:36 - 40:40)
make sense yeah we won't know until then (40:38 - 40:42)
anything before team-up oh gosh that (40:40 - 40:45)
would be like shining shining legends is (40:42 - 40:47)
cut right now you could probably still (40:45 - 40:49)
find shining legends dragon majesty is (40:47 - 40:53)
cut base sun and moon lost thunder (40:49 - 40:55)
celestial storm forbidden light ultra (40:53 - 40:57)
prism cribs and invasion burning (40:55 - 41:00)
guardians rising all cut I don't think a (40:57 - 41:01)
lot of cards were being used (41:00 - 41:02)
specifically from lost thunder or (41:01 - 41:06)
celestial storm besides like maybe like (41:02 - 41:09)
skateboard but those are those are all (41:06 - 41:11)
getting those are all getting cut team (41:09 - 41:12)
up still has doraji (41:11 - 41:14)
which is one of the best cards in the (41:12 - 41:18)
set unbroken bonds still has like welder (41:14 - 41:20)
which is very good Charizard rush RAM (41:18 - 41:23)
which is pretty good team up has zekrom (41:20 - 41:25)
Pikachu which is good unified mine says (41:23 - 41:26)
Mewtwo in Mew which is really good (41:25 - 41:30)
cosmic Eclipse has ADP rubble clash has (41:26 - 41:33)
boss's orders and then the last bit of (41:30 - 41:36)
TCG news here is there is a sword and (41:33 - 41:39)
shield figure collection I know you guys (41:36 - 41:41)

to put them in raids really actually (44:50 - 44:55)
cool for them to do they're they really (44:52 - 44:59)
you know some would argue at e3 when (44:55 - 45:01)
they sat on stage and they said we cut (44:59 - 45:02)
some Pokemon to make competitive better (45:01 - 45:06)
and then you know unfortunately you know (45:02 - 45:08)
a world pandemic happened so they had to (45:06 - 45:10)

people are salty by nature but they've (45:28 - 45:33)
been very positive on the season in game (45:30 - 45:36)
wise they've made it incredibly easy to (45:33 - 45:37)
rent teams incredibly easy to build (45:36 - 45:40)

powerful Pokemon have good IVs get (45:40 - 45:45)
bottle caps change the natures (45:42 - 45:47)

like we acknowledge that these are the (45:47 - 45:51)
good Pokemon and we're gonna do two (45:49 - 45:53)

like drag a pallet or togekiss or (46:00 - 46:03)
excadrill I mean that's totally up to (46:01 - 46:06)
you but it's it's in my opinion very (46:03 - 46:08)
cool of them to like acknowledge that (46:06 - 46:11)
and do that somebody actually put a (46:08 - 46:12)
tickle in my ear for me to run a (46:11 - 46:14)

question of the week all right (51:17 - 51:21)
last week's pokemons of the week was a (51:20 - 51:26)
beautiful set of four haiku that I wrote (51:21 - 51:30)
just for everyone to enjoy it mentioned (51:26 - 51:34)
ecruteak which is a village city in geo (51:30 - 51:41)
two leaves made of rock I've said a mock (51:34 - 51:45)
a copy of grass says that it resists (51:41 - 51:51)
fire and that it doesn't change with the (51:45 - 51:56)
seasons and it is twice as strong as ice (51:51 - 51:59)
I think that's enough you guys should be (51:56 - 52:06)
able to guess who's that Pokemon forkel (51:59 - 52:10)
at least you didn't say chatot it's (52:06 - 52:15)
sudowoodo it is sudowoodo correct with a (52:10 - 52:19)
real good Pokemon shuffle icon that was (52:15 - 52:22)
in honor of Earth Day it's both grass (52:19 - 52:27)
and Earth it is the imitation Pokemon (52:22 - 52:30)
what that would be the pseudo part of (52:27 - 52:32)
the widow (52:30 - 52:32)
it was created by Ken Sugimori only one (52:32 - 52:38)
jet only one sudowoodo appears in (52:36 - 52:42)
generation two being sprayed with the (52:38 - 52:44)
squirt bottle and generation three only (52:42 - 52:47)
one sudowoodo appears this time from the (52:44 - 52:49)
whale more pale (52:47 - 52:51)
however in Gen 4 the player can get (52:49 - 52:54)
multiple sudowoodo by a falling bond sly (52:51 - 52:56)
or catching it in the grass yeah those (52:54 - 52:58)
two Naruto started to go get around (52:56 - 53:02)
that's it for the trivia yes a lot it (52:58 - 53:12)
appeared in the power of a second (53:02 - 53:14)
sudowoodo can be encountered in horde (53:12 - 53:16)
encounters with Porter Burnham f thing (53:14 - 53:18)
that I always found funny yeah that's (53:16 - 53:19)
for every right next to me I always (53:18 - 53:22)
found that funny like Oh cute that was (53:19 - 53:27)
that was pretty in freak top of the game (53:22 - 53:30)
right there whoever did that needed (53:27 - 53:34)
needed a swift raise maybe soon a photo (53:30 - 53:39)
is a combination of pseudo and wood and (53:34 - 53:50)
oh this week's Pokemon has I checked (53:39 - 53:52)
doesn't have any trivia and I'm (53:50 - 53:54)
suspicious I may have done this one (53:52 - 54:02)
