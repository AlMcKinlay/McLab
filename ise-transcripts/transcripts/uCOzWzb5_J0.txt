Paul I don't know what it is if you're gonna say some things better than deke done that's a given no thanks good deke town I got some Minnesota news here in our in our new section what do I do I do we got a show for you guys today we got some Pokemon Go news we got some Pokemon masters news there's a new TCG set out and there's a new raid rotation and pokemon sword and pokemon shield so let's everything we're running through today I guess because we're talking about Minnesota start with the Minnesota news this is often attend a life random neighbor sends apology pokemon cake after calling police on Pokemon go players a Minnesota resident called Amy Callum's has hit the news this week after receiving an apology pokemon cake from one of her neighbors as reported by Fox 35 Kellum decided to make a to make full use of the neighbors current quietness by taking her daughter outside to play pokemon go driving around in a car and stopping at any points of interest within the app eventually they were pulled over in their driveway by police who received a call mentioning a suspicious vehicle Callum's told the officials they were simply playing the game going on to share the story what happened on us-based social network site next door of course of course it was don't even go on there anymore nope next door might be the worst app to have ever existed I refused brent was on there for like a minute I'm like just stop I was on next door for like two weeks and I think that was the highest my blood pressure has ever been in my life this post was spotted by Callum's neighbors who just happened to be the one who called the police on them apparently the neighbor felt really bad about the mix-up Kelham said quote I understood it looked a little creepy with me driving with my car just cruising along slowly pulling over at imaginary stops once she heard what I was doing she felt really bad about it neighbor who ended up calling the police went around to apologize and offered a pokemon cake with the words sorry we called the cops on you written on the top the cake is cute though you'll be pleased to know that the neighbor stood ten feet back to deliver the package well then how'd they get the package mate I think they like put on the door rang the doorbell and walked away grandma and then ran away Hey they used to drone well the news isn't gonna really get better than that they say like what what town no or did they just say Minnesota resident because looking at KSTP oh I only do WCCO it's whistling Lino Lakes yeah that's a very confusingly named place all right this is off Pokemon go live.com a remote Wraith celebration oh I keep forgetting that started let's celebrate me too uh the ability that we added a new feature there's been a lot of weird free stuff going on with Pokemon go lately that's causing Meeks some issues they are doing a lot of cool things why is he causing you issues it's free yes or is it making your game go gunky well okay because alright let's get into it I mean I since Steve solved all my problems I did and now ride my bike and collect gifts to send out to everybody in the world which they appreciate all the way from the UK to Japan and then I open gifts every morning from everybody because that's pretty much how I play pokemon go send gifts receive gifts I literally I am not joking three days ago I deleted every pokeball that I had pokeball great ball Ultra Ball do though you never delete ultra balls well I certainly did hi cuz I never used them I deleted every potion super potion hyper potion max potion every single one I'm talking hundreds here hundreds deleted every berry that wasn't silver golden this morning I'm opening gifts from my dear cherished precious friends and it said your bag is full and I went and I looked to manage items I had 708 pokeballs where did 708 pokeballs come in three days without me spending a cent so when you open gifts now and spin stops it gives you like a ridiculous amount of pokeballs be nice because nobody's out there right because they me antic wants it so if you do go out or you do receive gifts that you can use those pokeballs to catch at home without worrying about like well I can only catch you know for Pokemon cuz I only got twenty pokeballs it's just a ploy for me to pay more money to maximize my back space I know what's going on oh that's probably true too I mean I don't know I don't think anyone's disagreeing with that but if you have those remote ray passes which is now available we talked about this maybe a month ago of how they were gonna do this how it was gonna work it's working it's in the game and they are celebrating by adding Darkrai Giratina and Virizion back to raids here from Tuesday April 28th through May 5th Darkrai will be available May 5th through May 12th the altered form a Giratina will be available and through May 12th through the May 19th Virizion will be available in five star raids I need to get that for is Ian that is my Pokemon really yeah it wasn't even a good TCG card I guess compiled ian was the worst but the three of those of us were in the swords of justice iwas Virizion it's just how it was who what do you mean who of us I know what are you saying that will was will is like the quail Ian no and I am the trachea no you're not in this yeah cuz I got that southern draw he'll do none of you were part of the swords of Justice this is Logan Jeff and me and then we'll got added in as killed you when did I get at it as Calvillo because you were all salty at GenCon once we're like fine he'll do is a salty Pokemon cuz we wanted to make you care them and you're like now and I'm like fine anybody do kill do I hate him you hate his no no come on you're not in it I think we're at this point 14 months without a bringing back Dialga and I think we're like 15 months without Palkia who are they who are they who are they I don't know I am assuming that Mantic is saving these those two pokemon for summer because as we learned with Rayquaza you save a pokemon people want and then you turn it shiny and you do it in the middle of summer and that's a huge moneymaker for you I don't think sorry Virizion I don't think you're a huge moneymaker for anyone hey not have slanderer like this there's also a new may research its shrinks and there's a team rocket is now on pause until the

think about how quickly time flies no no it feels like just yesterday that's some of us faced with the choice between Bulbasaur Charmander and squirtle right before starting our journey through the Kanto region now over 20 years later some of us are still exploring the world of Pokemon in the gallery region whether your journey with Pokemon began in 1996 with red that's the official way to say

favorite Pokemon okay is there a special Pikachu right now yes so there will be a Pikachu wearing the Hat of the Pokemon that won the region during one that region during the voting that we did back in February so because Charizard won the Kanto region the peak she's wearing the Charizard hat Umbreon won the johto region for favorite Pokemon Pikachu will be wearing an Umbreon at a hat when they switch to joto if you're lucky trainers during the johto throwback you will find a shiny Dunsparce there you go why do they do this to me an Umbreon hat during that time if you make it to the end of

and stunfisk but you're guaranteed one in the special research they are adding delayering mouth glaring zigzagoon - zigzagoon gallery' and Darumaka and gallery' and stunfisk in to 7k eggs you will also be able to evolve Clarion Meowth Clarion Zigzagoon and gallery' and darbuka into the glaring forms Pokemon originally discovered in the you know very gentle more frequently in the wild pretty big events I mean shiny Dunsparce and that's all you had to say for a great man now you got to do it I I mean like how do I want to wear this it is cool that remote raids exist and that right now currently you have full power when you're in a remote raid whereas in the future you'll have have your power will be halved if you join a remote raid but besides like sitting at home or maybe I guess sitting at the office you're really not going to need to remote raid I guess like if it was nice out and if it was safe outside I would just walk to the raid but I guess there could be a time where like somehow I can't get to the raid or I see that our people are in it so I'll just join it cuz I can't walk there in ten minutes and they're probably already starting problem is it's the attractive nuisance problem it's like we know that if you were to walk to a raid and it's kind of like when I ride my bike it's the same thing if you were to walk to a raid you wouldn't go near anyone number one because you're you and number two because you know you're not supposed to be near anybody but other people just are very careless about that and Niantic doesn't want to take the blame sure oh that's why they're really pushing the whole remote raid thing and they're gonna keep pushing it for a long time no I mean I think it's fine now but I'm just saying like when things open back up it's not going to open that back up that fast right but in like a you say a year like okay a year is your mo trades gonna be still a thing well it all still be a thing but late is it we're spending the dollar to not leave your house to do a Charmander I don't know it will be it's like for people like me I don't I don't even if the raid is at the far corner of my building I don't want to have to get up and put on clothes office they may have a break this may see we're getting to that mate it may take them longer to get there especially since smoke you know most raids you can't get there when it starts you're not getting in on that raid like if you're not there right when it starts five minutes late there's nobody there doing it anymore I mean there isn't there is an attractive aspect of oh hey I can just quick jump in here I'll be at half power but like I'm joining 19 other people it doesn't matter what my strength is right and I still have a chance to capture it and I don't have to try to get off this conference call or rush and try to run there to get there in time like there's an attraction that happens to me every once in a while where I pop it in like oh well I won't make it there by the time everybody else is there but if I had a remote option I'd be like well I'll spend the buck because it's one I don't have and I'll just do it real quick it would be cool if you can do remote raise with friends but that's not a thing I don't know if that'll ever be a thing I mean if your friends are in your house with you but I guess the the argument for remote rating with friends would be the same argument with like let me trade with my lucky friends I have lucky friends within Australia but I have no plans of going to Australia any time soon all right well that's all the Pokemon good news so with that being said we'll take a quick break when we come back we got some TCG news some anime news and some sword and shield news so we will be right back [Music] hey if you're listening to this that means you've made it to the break and it is the start of the month which means I bring up our patreon which you probably heard of you listen to the show first off thank you our 10 year

Pokemon TV that's about it what what is the character in that because I'm it's it's funny that the title doesn't start with B&W which I thought all of their seasons did hmm black and white rival destinies arriving to Pokemon TV which is the fifteenth season of the Pokemon anime where Ash ends up battling alder the champion of you Nova rival destinies also features thunderous tornado sand Landorus but no n was ending before that or after that I don't remember I think n was a cadet and was at the end and yeah so this was like just the Forgotten season that nobody watched yeah probably is this where when they do ass and I'll community day we all complain and throw her and hands up in the air when they don't put sunglasses on sand I'll I plan on it yeah I was on the elevator in my building and some stranger got on the elevator with me going up and had a squirtle on their bag and I said does your squirtle have sunglasses and they said no and I was like well why are you wasting my time no they said Oh outsider that's right okay yeah something outsider would say both of my masters news full disclosure I am partnered with DNA who makes Pokemon masters this is off Pokemon comm though silver and ho-oh and Wallace and milotic joined battle in Pokemon masters how o comes to pass EO the new legendary event pure hearts and rainbow wings not only stars ho-oh but also the rival trainer from poke em pokemon gold and silver ethan and silver that's how I can tell somebody's not a true pokemon fan because they don't call Ethan by Ethan's name here heart that's my geek keeping for this episode pure hearts and rainbow wings will feature a revamp to legendary events that will continue for all future events collect prize coins to earn special rewards from the prize box you can obtain a area you can obtain area info featuring a new sync pair for silver and ho-oh which is the new event so hope for those that might not be playing Pokemon masters or unsure oh oh is not in the loot boxes you just have to do an event but this event gives you gems and I guess it's a random chance to get ho oh in stead of like guaranteed chance I haven't gotten ho yet but I guess people are I don't know you haven't done this yet either Greg no I haven't started I mean I got I picked my egg and then I was like distracted by something else and that's been my all bye bubble games I get distracted by something else and then I forget to go back but I haven't started it yet so I don't like I haven't seen any of the stuff if you haven't visited passio lately you you won't want to miss the new Pokemon egg you can evolve the egg that will hatch into Bulbasaur Charmander or squirtle after several battles I believe it to be five you can then form a sync pair with that Pokemon and even give it a nickname in the future eggs will allow players to add a variety of Pokemon to their team in addition players can now perform a free daily Scout once a day do I get to pick what my egg hatches into in some manner yeah oh you pick the egg yeah we were debating I think a week or two ago whether these Pokemon would be able to evolve they can evolve DNA told me the difference is these Pokemon don't so like the I guess the question would be like why would you want to get Blastoise when blues future sync pair will have Blastoise just like red as Charizard and DNA said the differences those Pokemon can take advantage of mega evolution these Pokemon and eggs cannot is my friendship not high enough with them how node and it never will be chance to scout and another another incredible pair Wallace is spotlight Wallace and milotic bring their dazzling battle style to Pokemon masters with beautiful tricky attacks like grand illusion and mirror coat on May 1st Cinthia spotlight pokey fair will return in addition to this you were more moral at most more likely be able to scout 5 star sync pairs you will also have the chance to pull the powerful sync pair of Cynthia and Garchomp which I need but I really need Wallace more and they're doing a login so I think there's another return to poke my masters event so if you haven't logged in and more than what is it like 30 days 45 days you get a bunch more gems and then yeah but they're also doing the legendary event which you're getting 300 gems even if you did place yes yes so they're doing the if you haven't played and you just want to stock up on gems you they should have a welcome back campaign for you if you haven't played in more than a month and then if you are continuing playing you should be logging in every day just to collect your 300 gems and do your what's it called the tactics no not the tactics it's called the my bingo card no not your bingo card the daily ie tome login bonus the daily Scout that's what it's called you get a daily Scout that gives you like 10 items man Wallace while since Cynthia are on two different banners I don't understand the concept of a banner a banner is just the like the type of loot box that you're pulling from Paul in a tendency if I get Wallace are we all ready for me to be extremely disappointed yes I'm ready for you to get Wallace so think of the banners like the like when you walk up to a bubblegum machine and this bubblegum machine has like red blue yellow but this bubblegum machine is just spearmint they don't even happen anymore that was the worst Paul I have ever had oh no what did you get I got Bugsy surge Whitney Bryson Seibold Bruno oh why am i blinking in her name Mina Wulfric and another lieutenants urge you garbage service yes yes garbage I had to Cynthia's in a poll one time it's pretty sweet speaking of spending money rebel clash is now available that's about it wasn't the best card in rebel clash is it Sableye boss's orders boss's orders what does that do boss it is Pokemon catcher without the flip oh nice they're bringing that back it was in X&Y it was called Lysander people hated it so back in the day back in the day when wil and I played competitive Pokemon TCG it was during the time of okay mom black in pokemon white we had beautiful sets like emerging powers and plasma storm those are two very bad sets but there was a card there was a trainer collared called Pokemon catcher and you could have four on your deck and you would always have four in your deck and it was a trainer card and you could play as many trainer cards as you want on your turn and if all it did was it said this pokémon on your bench I want to kill it promote it I knock it out I win the game yeah basically and then they said that carts too good we're changing it so now instead of you doing it you got to flip a coin if heads you can do that if tails you've wasted that card 5050 and nobody played it ever again after that well I mean some people still played it but then they came out with a card called Lysander and X&Y after black and white and Lysander was exactly Pokemon catcher you play it you go that pokémon on your bench promote it because I'm gonna knock it out and win the game but they changed it to a supporter card which means you can only play one supporter a turn but it was still very powerful and then they got rid of Lysander and everyone rejoiced in Sun and Moon there was nothing or that although there was a Kuzma which is kind of like that as well but it required both people to flip but there's ways around that as well but they have reprinted Lysander and it's called boss's orders and is the best card I think in the set it is if you pull a normal one it is about ten bucks if you pull a full art one it is about 32 dollars and if you pull a rainbow rare one it is about 35 dollars I pulled a hundred and one at digital booster packs last night I saw some of that I pulled this you can narrow lane I can't can't complain I drew giggles not complain uh I pulled zero boss's orders though oh yeah I did you know honey yeah you'll never win he'll never we are what did you get multiples of I got two ADP's which is what is that Arceus dialga Palkia the best card currently in the format I thought boss's orders was the best card no passes orders is the best card in rebel Clara backlash and boss's orders just makes ADP even better what does ADP do uh ATP just does a bunch of really dumb stuff they have unlimited Ray so ATP is about a $30 card for one water one metal and one double on one colorless it does a hundred and fifty damage and you can search in your deck for up to three basic energy cards and attach them to any pokemon the way in any way you would like and you can do that every turn it's week two Fairy guess what pokemon no one's using anymore I thought they rotated fairy out they did as of sword and shield but ADP came from Sun and Moon cosmic eclipse which is still legal it's week two fairy which no one is playing anymore and then ADP has a GX move called altered creation GX for the rest of this game your pokémon attacks do thirty more damage to your bonus Active Pokemon for the rest of the game if this Pokemon has at least one extra water energy on it in addition when your opponent's active pokémon is knocked out you get to take an extra price it's a basic it's a basic it does a hundred and fifty for one water energy and what do that attack no no one water energy one melon one color so it's three energies to do 150 but you can do it every turn and every time you do it you can search in your deck for three more energies and attach them to any other Pokemon in any other way you would like goes really really good with the sash E&V huzzah Shion is now out an altered Cree cache it's so good yeah if you do altered creation GX you're now doing 180 every turn no penalty you're just attaching energy so I pulled two of those cards last night in the digital card game not the not IRL I don't I don't know how they have not thought about banning a DP do they have banned and restricted in Pokemon or they just wait for things to rotate out no they do like reset stamp is banded and expanded right now you can't use reset stamp at all and expanded they banned it what does that do reset stamp forces your opponent to shuffle their hand in their deck and draw four cards but that doesn't seem that bad what anytime your for it like if your important I has seven cards and you bring them down to four cards you know that's good I mean it's good but it's not like bring them down to zero cards well yeah but expanded as a disaster expand to be still playing hypnotoxic laser there you go this was april 27th to stop pokemon calm speaking of TCG they announced the 2021 season now remember we've talked about this a couple weeks ago that the 2020 season is canceled the 2021 worlds will take place in Europe the 2021 season will start in August August 28th will start the 2021 season so anytime worlds happens we get a rotate we rotate it out of you know these cards are no longer legal so they're keeping Sun and Moon team up that's gonna be the oldest set you'll be able to use so if you're walking into a target or a Walmart don't buy oh gosh there's a lot of sudden moon sets well so this is this is what you can buy that will be good all the way until August 2021 guaranteed it's gonna be Sun and Moon team-up detective Pikachu Sun and Moon unbroken bonds Sun and Moon unified Minds hidden faiths which you probably won't even be able to find anyways Sun and Moon cosmic eclipse that's where you would find a DP sword and shield and sword and shield rebel clash so those are all the sets that will be legal starting August 28th 2020 and will go until August of 2021 I would assume come August 2021 they're probably gonna cut team up unbroken bond signified mine and cosmic Eclipse and probably just do base sword and shield at that point but we won't know that make sense yeah we won't know until then anything before team-up oh gosh that would be like shining shining legends is cut right now you could probably still find shining legends dragon majesty is cut base sun and moon lost thunder celestial storm forbidden light ultra prism cribs and invasion burning guardians rising all cut I don't think a lot of cards were being used specifically from lost thunder or celestial storm besides like maybe like skateboard but those are those are all getting those are all getting cut team up still has doraji which is one of the best cards in the set unbroken bonds still has like welder which is very good Charizard rush RAM which is pretty good team up has zekrom Pikachu which is good unified mine says Mewtwo in Mew which is really good cosmic Eclipse has ADP rubble clash has boss's orders and then the last bit of TCG news here is there is a sword and shield figure collection I know you guys I need you guys to calm them down I know the excitement is out of control right now but are they Funko's they are knots more Pokemon interest increased or decreased well more Pokemon originally discovered in the gala region have arrived in the Pokemon Trading

top Pokemon currently in the Pokemon TCG these are all top Pokemon currently in the Pokemon video game they decided to put them in raids really actually cool for them to do they're they really you know some would argue at e3 when they sat on stage and they said we cut some Pokemon to make competitive better and then you know unfortunately you know a world pandemic happened so they had to cancel the competitive season but they really did make competitive better it's been really good it's been really fun so many people who didn't get into competitive gotten competitive the current competitive people you know the top players who who make youtube content whose stream on Twitch all competitive people are salty by nature but they've been very positive on the season in game wise they've made it incredibly easy to rent teams incredibly easy to build teams incredibly easy to find these powerful Pokemon have good IVs get bottle caps change the natures and then going an extra step and saying like we acknowledge that these are the good Pokemon and we're gonna do two weeks of these good Pokemon in raids so you can get them for yourselves now whether or not you want to use them whether or not you like using Pokemon like drag a pallet or togekiss or excadrill I mean that's totally up to you but it's it's in my opinion very cool of them to like acknowledge that and do that somebody actually put a tickle in my ear for me to run a tournament and I'm thinking I might do it ooh tournament is something like that you know it's gonna have some Holly Hill to it that's gonna make everyone miserable ice-type only possibly ice bug-type only yeah I'm into it that'll go till May 11th if you haven't done any of these raids we do Monday right night on twitch twitch TV slash pkmn

still hasn't visited my Island he'll get there yeah I mean he's like Santa Claus one on island at a time okay is that how it works yeah yeah yeah sure ah this is from hailey of all the snacks and drinks that have been featured in Pokemon games that are edible for humans which are the ones you would like to try which are the ones you would least like to try along the lines of lava cookie in lavaridge town the old gateau of the old chateau taboo cocoa pinup juice etc sorry we just drinks or just cookies or there's a garage candy bar I mean I'm kind of into the rage candy bar um but you know is it Rosalia tier rosary tea great which one it is things Rosalyn Coffee no coffee yeah Rose rate tea you know I'm trying rosary trees like even if I hate it I will drink it until I like it what if it has cheese on top mmm I mean I'm not a violently opposed to cheese I just got my first choice so wait do I remember properly that if you wanted to wake up one of the DAR manna tan in the desert that was slumbering you had to give it a rage candy bar yeah but it's like it was a statue it was in Zen mode it was in it's well you farm but when it's in Zen mode it looks like a statue and then yeah I'm just gonna like you just shove that race head around its Mountain maybe it just smelled it so then the other question is how do I get the Zen with Zen mode Colleran cuz oh it's right oh yeah that's right hidden abilities are in me yeah yeah it's in rates I have one I am a I don't understand why but for some reason I eat a lot of ice cream I'm gonna go away Christelle yacon yeah tell your code hey that's good I mean and there's so many like all the malasadas like why no not to be good right I'm a malasada traditionalist I just want the very plain original and anything else no thank you what about all the cupcakes that were part of X and why did they have a name because some of those cupcakes look real good no they weren't cupcakes they were those special kind of cookies macaron oh yeah oh yeah cuz Victini had a bunch of those no that's black and white well isn't it anyways Rose rate T and I'll have a castelia cone and I'm just going to try a rage candy bar just to see and if I get too angry will cut back pokey beans that was another thing pass but they're just jelly beans begin with you probably the Pokemon eat the pokey beans people done you can eat cat food nothing stopping you Oh true story true story to story for my childhood do you want to hear a sad story from my childhood you ate pokey beans no my next-door neighbor who is my friend because you really were limited in your friend choices they had two dogs and in their entryway they had a giant bag of dog food and every time we went out the front door as a snack he could grab a giant handful of dog food to munch while we were out playing and every time he's like do you want some and I'm like no I'm good thanks you're eating dog food will save us question of the week all right last week's pokemons of the week was a beautiful set of four haiku that I wrote just for everyone to enjoy it mentioned ecruteak which is a village city in geo two leaves made of rock I've said a mock a copy of grass says that it resists fire and that it doesn't change with the seasons and it is twice as strong as ice I think that's enough you guys should be able to guess who's that Pokemon forkel at least you didn't say chatot it's sudowoodo it is sudowoodo correct with a real good Pokemon shuffle icon that was in honor of Earth Day it's both grass and Earth it is the imitation Pokemon what that would be the pseudo part of the widow it was created by Ken Sugimori only one jet only one sudowoodo appears in generation two being sprayed with the squirt bottle and generation three only one sudowoodo appears this time from the whale more pale however in Gen 4 the player can get multiple sudowoodo by a falling bond sly or catching it in the grass yeah those two Naruto started to go get around that's it for the trivia yes a lot it appeared in the power of a second sudowoodo can be encountered in horde encounters with Porter Burnham f thing that I always found funny yeah that's for every right next to me I always found that funny like Oh cute that was that was pretty in freak top of the game right there whoever did that needed needed a swift raise maybe soon a photo is a combination of pseudo and wood and oh this week's Pokemon has I checked doesn't have any trivia and I'm suspicious I may have done this one before but chatot I don't know if I mentioned it last week but I said I'm gonna do a crossword so this week's Pokemon of the week is a crossword puzzle I will give you the clues as a cross and down and if you are one of those people that wants to do it based on start getting a paper and pencil now so you can start writing down the clues if you want to try to do it as one of those like formless crosswords where you have to figure out where the things cross go right ahead if not I will post a link to the actual crossword on my Twitter and in slack and wherever I can get that link out there to people and then you'll have one that you can fill on the internet because it's 2020 the name of the crossword puzzle is for golden rings not ariana grande the across Clues listened carefully across one like a recording studio three what you achieve when you win five the electric Mouse Pokemon seven like a hummingbird eight type that isn't strange eleven fifth generation region 12 the number for your perfect person 13 the path you take paved or not 14 to ram head first 17 it is paved for transportation your down clues are to one who seeks clues for this week's pokemon six two parts of the body connected by the digestive system nine acting without care 10 what a battery holds 15 hairstyle popular in the 60s and 70s 16 the top of a match and I will also say you don't have to solve the crossword if you just listen to the clues you can probably figure out with the pokemons just from those if you think through them a little bit alright well that's our episode thank you guys for listening if you want to follow us on Twitter will is at washing the sink Greg's that
