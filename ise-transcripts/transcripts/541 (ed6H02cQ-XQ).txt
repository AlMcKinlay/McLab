541st episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:30)

losing my voice recording so many (0:30 - 0:35)

did it for you (0:55 - 0:58)
um so we're recording this a little bit (0:59 - 1:04)
early uh because it is a holiday weekend (1:01 - 1:08)
and I am also traveling so uh I think (1:04 - 1:10)
fingers crossed that there will be no (1:08 - 1:13)
Pokemon news this weekend I mean except (1:10 - 1:16)
for the Eevee stuff uh the Evie raids (1:13 - 1:18)
but that was already announced (1:16 - 1:19)
um I don't think we're gonna get a patch (1:18 - 1:21)
or any I mean it'd be very cool if we (1:19 - 1:22)
got a patch that would actually be great (1:21 - 1:24)
but uh if this comes out on Monday and (1:22 - 1:26)
and you're like why didn't you cover (1:24 - 1:27)
this it's because we're recording on a (1:26 - 1:29)
Wednesday night so (1:27 - 1:30)
um (1:29 - 1:32)
that's the plan here uh and we're just (1:30 - 1:36)
gonna go through this uh and and kind of (1:32 - 1:38)
just get through the news (1:36 - 1:40)
um and we'll go from there so we'll (1:38 - 1:42)
start with the we'll just jump right (1:40 - 1:44)
into things oh sorry before we jump into (1:42 - 1:45)
things you're probably listening to this (1:44 - 1:47)
being like Oh what if there's spoilers (1:45 - 1:48)
for the episode (1:47 - 1:49)
um (1:48 - 1:52)
there will be no scarlet and violet (1:49 - 1:54)
spoilers uh anything that was in (1:52 - 1:57)
trailers like um (1:54 - 2:00)
uh belly bolt uh obviously that's fair (1:57 - 2:03)
game Mela fair game but you know don't (2:00 - 2:06)
worry about spoiling Gym Leaders or (2:03 - 2:07)
Elite Four or whatever else happens (2:06 - 2:09)
we're saving that for the many episodes (2:07 - 2:12)
so if you want scarlet and violet stuff (2:09 - 2:14)
the mini episode there should be too (2:12 - 2:15)
many episodes already up in your podcast (2:14 - 2:19)
app two more coming later this week uh (2:15 - 2:21)
and then eventually we'll normalize that (2:19 - 2:23)
get that into the rather other episodes (2:21 - 2:25)
we just want people to be able to still (2:23 - 2:26)
listen to their Monday episode still get (2:25 - 2:29)
their Pokemon news not stress about like (2:26 - 2:31)
I don't I'm not that far or I haven't (2:29 - 2:32)
got the game yet so this is we're going (2:31 - 2:35)

there will be a special research (3:10 - 3:14)
um and then they're reminding everyone (3:13 - 3:17)
very last minute that there's a Ultra (3:14 - 3:19)
Beast arrival Global on Sunday November (3:17 - 3:21)
27th from 11.5 that should have already (3:19 - 3:23)
happened hopefully that was fun it was (3:21 - 3:25)
fun it was so great I'm sure it was like (3:23 - 3:28)
amazing amazing time for all I really (3:25 - 3:29)
loved it (3:28 - 3:33)
um and then uh there will be (3:29 - 3:36)
uh spawns happening uh Lunatone Soul (3:33 - 3:39)
Rock Muna uh all that stuff (3:36 - 3:42)
more importantly besides the Avatar (3:39 - 3:45)
items they're having how how are you (3:42 - 3:48)
guys feeling about Pokemon go recently (3:45 - 3:51)
we can start with Bob (3:48 - 3:53)
you know one of the things I really (3:51 - 3:56)
liked about the alola generation have (3:53 - 3:58)
been the ultra beasts I feel like people (3:56 - 4:01)
just never really clicked with them but (3:58 - 4:03)
I will say the promotion that Pokemon go (4:01 - 4:05)
have been doing recently with all the (4:03 - 4:08)
ultra beasts have been fantastic like on (4:05 - 4:09)
Twitter and Tick Tock I've been seeing (4:08 - 4:12)
all these AR videos of people in like (4:09 - 4:14)
Japan getting attacked by Ultra beasts (4:12 - 4:15)
and I love that but not people getting (4:14 - 4:17)
attacked by Ultra beasts about it I love (4:15 - 4:20)
the content so the fact that we are (4:17 - 4:21)
getting more Ultra Beast love than (4:20 - 4:24)
Pokemon go actually got me excited to (4:21 - 4:27)
play Pokemon go again there's a bit of a (4:24 - 4:28)
lull especially from like the summer (4:27 - 4:30)
time with go Fest and then kind of (4:28 - 4:32)
dipped a little bit but as soon as I got (4:30 - 4:34)
Fair most of coming into the game and (4:32 - 4:36)
then buzzwall coming into the game uh (4:34 - 4:38)
I've just been super excited just to hop (4:36 - 4:42)
in some raids open up the app uh sped a (4:38 - 4:44)
few pokestops catch a few Pokemon here (4:42 - 4:46)
and there so I think I like these little (4:44 - 4:47)
events but I think it's promotional that (4:46 - 4:50)
they've been doing really sold it for me (4:47 - 4:53)
so I'm just excited for what's coming up (4:50 - 4:56)
uh in the next few months with this (4:53 - 4:58)
Bev I think the first time we met was (4:56 - 5:01)
Pokemon go Fest in Chicago is that yeah (4:58 - 5:03)
I think so (5:01 - 5:05)
I think so yeah that sounds about right (5:03 - 5:08)
that or paxed yes I might have been PAX (5:05 - 5:09)
East (5:08 - 5:12)
it was either packs or yeah like uh like (5:09 - 5:14)
the second go Fest Maybe (5:12 - 5:16)
I'm not sure (5:14 - 5:19)
I felt like you came out yeah people (5:16 - 5:22)
crew like the East the East Coast crew (5:19 - 5:24)
yeah (5:22 - 5:24)
I didn't go to the first I think packs (5:25 - 5:29)
that you went to (5:27 - 5:31)
so how many packs of East have you gone (5:29 - 5:33)
to is it two or three (5:31 - 5:35)
uh let's see I went to the one right (5:33 - 5:37)
before kovid destroyed the world and (5:35 - 5:39)
then I went to the one after coven was (5:37 - 5:40)
done but that's not true still but you (5:39 - 5:42)
know I went to that one and then I think (5:40 - 5:44)
I think four (5:42 - 5:46)
I think I was there for the snowstorm (5:44 - 5:48)
but I think I went (5:46 - 5:50)
okay I was also there when you weren't (5:48 - 5:51)
there (5:50 - 5:53)
what you were supposed to be there yeah (5:51 - 5:56)
then yes correct (5:53 - 5:59)
that was that was one so yeah booked the (5:56 - 6:02)
wrong month but the right days just the (5:59 - 6:03)
wrong month (6:02 - 6:05)
and then I hung out with Nick that's (6:03 - 6:08)
that's all that matters the right days (6:05 - 6:09)
yeah (6:08 - 6:12)
um so I don't know I haven't really like (6:09 - 6:14)
I kind of fell off Pokemon go like right (6:12 - 6:15)
at the start of panda because it's been (6:14 - 6:17)
a bit of a struggle for me to get back (6:15 - 6:20)
into it although like Bob said I love (6:17 - 6:21)
the ultra Beast I feel like they're also (6:20 - 6:24)
like a very underappreciated (6:21 - 6:27)
um like Pokemon from from uh sun and (6:24 - 6:30)
moon and I also just love solgaleo and (6:27 - 6:34)
Luna and Lulu I can't lunala (6:30 - 6:36)
um so I would be very excited to get (6:34 - 6:40)
that into uh into my Pokedex uh entry or (6:36 - 6:44)
whatever uh Pokedex so I could complete (6:40 - 6:46)
that not that I'm doing such a great job (6:44 - 6:47)
of completing them (6:46 - 6:50)
[Laughter] (6:47 - 6:54)
um yeah and then I think uh (6:50 - 6:55)
I think the new season is starting soon (6:54 - 6:58)
although let me double check here on (6:55 - 7:00)
niantic's website uh (6:58 - 7:02)
this Ultra Beast thing is really weird (7:00 - 7:03)
because uh again we're recording before (7:02 - 7:07)
I'm going to the ultra Beast thing in LA (7:03 - 7:11)
and I'm just curious just (7:07 - 7:14)
how that's actually gonna go because (7:11 - 7:18)
it's uh a holiday weekend but also a (7:14 - 7:20)
free event I think they could have (7:18 - 7:22)
gotten away with paying for it like I (7:20 - 7:25)
feel like I had somebody I had Steven (7:22 - 7:27)
from our slack he came he came into the (7:25 - 7:29)
slot he came to my twitch and he was (7:27 - 7:31)
like hey should I go to this I love (7:29 - 7:33)
Pokemon go it's like a six hour drive (7:31 - 7:35)
and I was like (7:33 - 7:37)
what if you get there and like they're (7:35 - 7:39)
full because it's first come first serve (7:37 - 7:41)
and like what if you leave at 8am you (7:39 - 7:44)
get in at like you know 2 p.m and again (7:41 - 7:46)
lying around the block and they're (7:44 - 7:48)
cutting people off like I almost feel (7:46 - 7:50)
like if the ticket was just twenty (7:48 - 7:52)
dollars that's a lot but at least you're (7:50 - 7:55)
securing your place so you know that and (7:52 - 7:59)
it's LA right like like you know five (7:55 - 8:01)
miles in La is like 17 hours because of (7:59 - 8:05)
traffic so like yeah (8:01 - 8:07)
um yeah so there's like no guarantee (8:05 - 8:08)
that you actually get there on time (8:07 - 8:11)
right so I was like ah if I were you I (8:08 - 8:14)
probably would not head out because you (8:11 - 8:16)
have no guaranteed spot (8:14 - 8:17)
um (8:16 - 8:20)
but well I guess we'll see uh I I've (8:17 - 8:23)
always liked niantic's real world events (8:20 - 8:24)
and stuff (8:23 - 8:28)
um but again La holiday weekend I don't (8:24 - 8:30)
know if they said limited capacity I (8:28 - 8:31)
don't know if that's a thousand people (8:30 - 8:33)
or ten thousand people or (8:31 - 8:36)
I have no clue but (8:33 - 8:38)
uh well I feel like people usually leave (8:36 - 8:41)
cities like for holidays so it could be (8:38 - 8:43)
less crowded than usual but I'm just (8:41 - 8:46)
consummating there and unlike Bob I like (8:43 - 8:48)
Ultra Beast attacking people so you know (8:46 - 8:51)
if that's like a feature that would be (8:48 - 8:54)
cool to watch that would be cool but I (8:51 - 8:55)
would say I think I think niantics (8:54 - 8:57)
should not be afraid to do more of these (8:55 - 9:00)
premium events like I think people would (8:57 - 9:04)
be willing to spend 10 maybe 15 possibly (9:00 - 9:07)
we've seen it with go Fest I think if (9:04 - 9:09)
you make this a premium event during a (9:07 - 9:10)
you know during a weekend where most (9:09 - 9:12)
people may not be available because (9:10 - 9:14)
they're with families and listening to (9:12 - 9:17)
their family members uh uh talk a lot um (9:14 - 9:18)
this would be a great opportunity for (9:17 - 9:20)
them to leave the house and you know (9:18 - 9:21)
catch some Pokemon I mean La is just (9:20 - 9:24)
it's basically no matter when you go you (9:21 - 9:27)
have traffic you have LAX and even if (9:24 - 9:29)
you're trying to leave on a Sunday like (9:27 - 9:31)
I would be upset to your point Steve (9:29 - 9:32)
I'll be upset if I'm like oh yeah I'm (9:31 - 9:35)
gonna drive four or five hours fly even (9:32 - 9:38)
to this event and realize oh sorry (9:35 - 9:39)
you're out of luck you have to play now (9:38 - 9:41)
on the streets of LA you can't come in (9:39 - 9:43)
here it's like oh well that's fun (9:41 - 9:45)
um so I I like the idea of doing more (9:43 - 9:47)
premium events to guarantee a spot but (9:45 - 9:51)
we'll see you know we'll see how it goes (9:47 - 9:51)
like like what if they did like first (9:51 - 9:56)
hundred people uh guaranteed spots if (9:54 - 9:58)
you pay ten dollars and the rest is free (9:56 - 10:00)
because then at least like if you get (9:58 - 10:02)
into that spot you'll you'll know that (10:00 - 10:04)
it's worth a six hour drive because you (10:02 - 10:05)
definitely have you're definitely gonna (10:04 - 10:08)
make it I think there's also a good way (10:05 - 10:10)
to like check demand of like how many (10:08 - 10:12)
tickets are we selling I mean I I (10:10 - 10:14)
believe they told me that this is a (10:12 - 10:16)
two-hour event I think it starts at six (10:14 - 10:18)
or seven and it goes till eight or nine (10:16 - 10:20)
um and again they didn't they didn't say (10:18 - 10:24)
what the venue capacity was but (10:20 - 10:27)
um you know an eight hour event like um (10:24 - 10:31)
a safari zone maybe those are like six (10:27 - 10:35)
hours uh that's like a 25 experience (10:31 - 10:38)
um so yeah I again I think (10:35 - 10:41)
I I I hate to be the one that's like (10:38 - 10:43)
advocating for Niantic to (10:41 - 10:45)
like charge money for event because I do (10:43 - 10:46)
think a lot of the games should be free (10:45 - 10:49)
but in a situation where you may be (10:46 - 10:51)
traveling and not know if you get a (10:49 - 10:53)
ticket or not I think in that situation (10:51 - 10:55)
I would rather spend the ten dollars to (10:53 - 10:57)
know I have a seat (10:55 - 11:00)
uh than to like show up and wait in line (10:57 - 11:02)
all day I've waited in lines as a (11:00 - 11:04)
teenager for concerts and then other (11:02 - 11:07)
stuff it's it's never worth it it's it's (11:04 - 11:10)
not but but what Beth just said is as (11:07 - 11:11)
creating a hybrid experience like yes (11:10 - 11:13)
you can make the event available to (11:11 - 11:15)
anyone who can you're just adding (11:13 - 11:17)
another layer to the experience saying (11:15 - 11:18)
hey you know what it's free for (11:17 - 11:20)
everybody no matter where you are you (11:18 - 11:22)
can get the same exact rewards possibly (11:20 - 11:24)
you have the same experience but we have (11:22 - 11:27)
this other list it's almost like a you (11:24 - 11:29)
know a tier menu I feel like you can go (11:27 - 11:30)
to the next level and say hey for x (11:29 - 11:33)
amount of dollars come see us we'll give (11:30 - 11:36)
you X Y and Z on top of it so it's not (11:33 - 11:37)
like you're really missing out on what (11:36 - 11:39)
the event is offering you're just having (11:37 - 11:41)
the opportunity to get a different (11:39 - 11:44)
experience because you are actually (11:41 - 11:46)
paying for it and you've guaranteed the (11:44 - 11:47)
spot but (11:46 - 11:49)
um no I definitely I definitely (11:47 - 11:50)
understand what you're saying yeah (11:49 - 11:53)
winning the lines is so overrated (11:50 - 11:55)
um I've been to two concerts in my life (11:53 - 11:58)
I've never been doing it again so uh (11:55 - 12:00)
yeah (11:58 - 12:02)
I don't know I spent a lot of summers in (12:00 - 12:04)
Disney World so I'm just very used to (12:02 - 12:08)
lines at this point so I I would do it I (12:04 - 12:09)
don't know about driving six hours to (12:08 - 12:10)
wait in line but I would definitely do (12:09 - 12:11)
it (12:10 - 12:15)
uh some other mobile news here is well (12:11 - 12:16)
actually let's get that speaking of (12:15 - 12:19)
selling out uh the squishmallows sold (12:16 - 12:21)
out (12:19 - 12:22)
um I'm not sure if either of you are (12:21 - 12:24)
squished mellow fans I talked about last (12:22 - 12:26)
week how well I don't know if you can (12:24 - 12:27)
see the YouTube video it might be cut (12:26 - 12:30)
off but Pokemon sent me a swish mellow (12:27 - 12:32)
um Bobby was right he predicted they (12:30 - 12:33)
were going to be 30 bucks probably (12:32 - 12:35)
because he's a secret squish mellow (12:33 - 12:37)
collector I would imagine (12:35 - 12:40)
he owns stocking (12:37 - 12:43)
they did end up being 30 uh and they (12:40 - 12:46)
sold out pretty much instantly like I (12:43 - 12:48)
think the Tweet went up and then if you (12:46 - 12:49)
didn't if you didn't click that tweet (12:48 - 12:51)
within 15-20 minutes they were they were (12:49 - 12:53)
gone (12:51 - 12:55)
um I was at work Steve and I couldn't (12:53 - 12:58)
get my squishmallow because I am I am (12:55 - 13:00)
working in an office and I'm like oh I (12:58 - 13:01)
saw the Tweet like 30 minutes too late (13:00 - 13:04)
and they was sold out and I felt dead (13:01 - 13:06)
inside (13:04 - 13:08)
Bev you got you I know you got a secret (13:06 - 13:10)
squishmallow collection behind you don't (13:08 - 13:12)
you (13:10 - 13:12)
well now behind me (13:12 - 13:15)
next week and or last week in Target and (13:16 - 13:21)
I was very very excited to find it and I (13:19 - 13:25)
have a couple like uh Mario shells of (13:21 - 13:27)
squishmallows (13:25 - 13:30)
and one red panda Fox so I'm starting to (13:27 - 13:32)
form a little collection and I wasn't (13:30 - 13:34)
initially I think intrigued by these but (13:32 - 13:37)
then I looked at Gengar and saw that it (13:34 - 13:39)
has like a little dragon back and now I (13:37 - 13:41)
want it I have no idea to have to have a (13:39 - 13:45)
Mario swish malbow oh yeah (13:41 - 13:47)
is this like the new Funko and we moved (13:45 - 13:48)
on from Funko where does that squish (13:47 - 13:51)
mellow now all these Brands I have one (13:48 - 13:54)
like like generic Dragon uh squish (13:51 - 13:56)
battle that I got from Target as well (13:54 - 13:58)
it's on our bed and it's just it's so (13:56 - 14:00)
comfortable to hold like it's so soft (13:58 - 14:02)
and I rest my head on it so as soon as I (14:00 - 14:04)
saw him Pikachu and Gengar I I think (14:02 - 14:06)
Gengar sold out first actually because (14:04 - 14:08)
you know I think the Gengar the Gengar (14:06 - 14:10)
one looks amazing and I think I would (14:08 - 14:12)
love to get that yeah back in stock but (14:10 - 14:13)
I can't wait to wait for the second wave (14:12 - 14:17)
to come through so I can pick one up (14:13 - 14:17)
yeah I I yeah I had like the little uh (14:17 - 14:23)
like one up a one-up marshmallow or (14:20 - 14:26)
mushroom sorry mushroom (14:23 - 14:30)
squish Marsh room I can't (14:26 - 14:32)
yeah I would imagine they would do a (14:30 - 14:35)
wave two or wave three just based on a (14:32 - 14:36)
dude that like they do they hate money (14:35 - 14:39)
like I feel like it's so easy to move (14:36 - 14:40)
these (14:39 - 14:42)
uh they moved them very quickly uh (14:40 - 14:46)
before were we after time here (14:42 - 14:48)
um okay uh I don't know if either of you (14:46 - 14:51)
play Pokemon Masters but there is a new (14:48 - 14:53)
event happening called the three EV (14:51 - 14:57)
Tales Evie's popular so uh this event is (14:53 - 15:00)
a special Eevee Day celebration actually (14:57 - 15:02)
I am lining up with the scarlet and (15:00 - 15:03)
violet stuff (15:02 - 15:04)
um Evie Day celebration that will allow (15:03 - 15:06)
players to get special sync pairs (15:04 - 15:08)
featuring Eevee evolutions and earn (15:06 - 15:09)
items to power them up it also (15:08 - 15:11)
introduced the sync pairs for Lucas and (15:09 - 15:14)
Flareon Chris and Jolteon and Lyra and (15:11 - 15:16)
Vaporeon (15:14 - 15:17)
um so (15:16 - 15:20)
and then we have the (15:17 - 15:24)
scarlet and violet EV raid weekend which (15:20 - 15:26)
I'm sure is just going to be a bunch of (15:24 - 15:29)
EVs and uh randomized stereotypes would (15:26 - 15:32)
be my guess (15:29 - 15:32)
I haven't played Matthew yeah I picked (15:32 - 15:36)
it back up recently (15:34 - 15:39)
are you liking it (15:36 - 15:39)
it's it's the heavy stuff (15:40 - 15:44)
I just get overwhelmed (15:46 - 15:52)
like I I like the idea of it I enjoyed (15:49 - 15:54)
very much playing in the early stages (15:52 - 15:56)
but like having 20 different events (15:54 - 15:58)
going on at the same time like I only (15:56 - 16:01)
have so much so much stamina and I only (15:58 - 16:03)
pick up this game maybe like once a day (16:01 - 16:06)
and I have to pick which event I want to (16:03 - 16:08)
do but the completionist in me wants to (16:06 - 16:10)
do them all and then I get like really (16:08 - 16:12)
sucked into like oh I need to like do (16:10 - 16:15)
meta and like get really good at uh like (16:12 - 16:17)
upgrading and getting all the right sync (16:15 - 16:19)
Pairs and then again I get burnt out and (16:17 - 16:21)
then I stop yeah this is my cycle with (16:19 - 16:25)
with Masters yeah I go on waves because (16:21 - 16:26)
when events like these drop I usually (16:25 - 16:28)
just open up the app for a couple of (16:26 - 16:30)
days get some free gems see if I got (16:28 - 16:32)
gems from the game itself and you know I (16:30 - 16:35)
do a few polls because I really for this (16:32 - 16:36)
game I I just like pulling just (16:35 - 16:38)
characters I like so if I know I'll like (16:36 - 16:41)
hey I know this character is coming to (16:38 - 16:43)
um Masters I just wanted from my (16:41 - 16:45)
collection I mean and then for battling (16:43 - 16:46)
I've just done Auto battling just to get (16:45 - 16:48)
through some of the stories but I feel (16:46 - 16:50)
like uh the last time I checked the game (16:48 - 16:52)
was when they rolled out the um the (16:50 - 16:55)
Friendship uh ability it's like you can (16:52 - 16:59)
like this is called dating simulator (16:55 - 16:59)
the I think Cynthia I believe but other (17:03 - 17:08)
than that it's just that I feel I feel (17:05 - 17:09)
like making friends Steve I'm not making (17:08 - 17:11)
good friends in this game so yeah I (17:09 - 17:13)
don't know what's wrong with me (17:11 - 17:13)
it is a game is definitely a good goal (17:14 - 17:20)
that's a good goal yeah (17:17 - 17:20)
um I didn't have this in the notes but (17:21 - 17:25)
if you know to the three people out (17:23 - 17:27)
there playing uh Pokemon cafe mix uh (17:25 - 17:29)
there's an event there unfortunately not (17:27 - 17:32)
an Eevee event it is a far-fetched event (17:29 - 17:35)
so maybe Bobby will get into uh (17:32 - 17:37)
um Pokemon cafe mix this event will be (17:35 - 17:40)
adding farfetch which is earned by uh (17:37 - 17:43)
which is obtained by earning (17:40 - 17:45)
um points with members in your team that (17:43 - 17:48)
event runs until November 28th uh oh I (17:45 - 17:51)
lied they are also adding a special (17:48 - 17:54)
costume in the delivery feature which is (17:51 - 17:56)
a festive Sylveon so there you go (17:54 - 17:57)
they're still they're still hitting (17:56 - 17:59)
their uh their Eevee quota like the (17:57 - 18:00)
other games are (17:59 - 18:03)
they have to hit it because (18:00 - 18:05)
um you know Evie I I heard it's pretty (18:03 - 18:06)
popular so (18:05 - 18:08)
three games spread it out I'm sure (18:06 - 18:11)
they'll hit some audience there so I I'm (18:08 - 18:14)
confident in Pokemon yeah (18:11 - 18:16)
uh I obviously when the episode goes up (18:14 - 18:19)
the the Eevee raid weekend will be over (18:16 - 18:22)
uh I'm curious though before we we jump (18:19 - 18:26)
to break if you guys enjoy the terror (18:22 - 18:27)
raids themselves just as a whole (18:26 - 18:28)
obviously there's a lot of different (18:27 - 18:31)
Pokemon it's gonna be Eevee this weekend (18:28 - 18:33)
or this past weekend (18:31 - 18:35)
um I don't know if you guys have tried (18:33 - 18:36)
those at all or if you did a lot of (18:35 - 18:38)
raids and sword and shield and maybe you (18:36 - 18:39)
like sword and shield better maybe you (18:38 - 18:41)
like Dynamax Adventure better I don't (18:39 - 18:43)
know maybe like the Pogo raids better (18:41 - 18:44)
um (18:43 - 18:46)
I don't know where do you guys stand on (18:44 - 18:48)
that I'm laughing because oh first of (18:46 - 18:51)
all I I love the new Terror raids in (18:48 - 18:53)
Scotland Violet I think they are (18:51 - 18:56)
definitely a uh improvement over sword (18:53 - 18:58)
and shield by that I mean it's real time (18:56 - 19:01)
like when they advertise when we first (18:58 - 19:02)
saw the trailers it's like oh yeah in (19:01 - 19:04)
real time you're having your commands (19:02 - 19:06)
you can heal you can do all these (19:04 - 19:09)
actions and that's what it is and I (19:06 - 19:11)
there were times where I did like my (19:09 - 19:13)
input for my attack and I was still in (19:11 - 19:14)
the sword and shield mindset where I (19:13 - 19:16)
just sat back like five minutes and I (19:14 - 19:18)
realized oh my God I'm almost I'm almost (19:16 - 19:20)
dead here I forgot to put another move (19:18 - 19:23)
in because I had real time so it really (19:20 - 19:25)
goes much faster and I've been liking (19:23 - 19:27)
just uh doing those because they are (19:25 - 19:28)
snappier you get through a lot more (19:27 - 19:30)
quickly (19:28 - 19:33)
um I'm curious to know and another game (19:30 - 19:35)
just came out but I wonder in the future (19:33 - 19:37)
if they're gonna like expand upon it (19:35 - 19:38)
where you have like a den like (19:37 - 19:40)
environment where we had Dynamax (19:38 - 19:41)
Adventures I know that that's probably (19:40 - 19:43)
like way out in the future but for now (19:41 - 19:45)
I've been pretty happy with doing Terror (19:43 - 19:48)
raids and they've been lots of fun (19:45 - 19:48)
yeah I've been really enjoying the Tara (19:49 - 19:53)
raids they're so much better in my (19:51 - 19:55)
opinion than the sword and shield once (19:53 - 19:57)
sword and shield was just such it was (19:55 - 19:58)
just a struggle to get through (19:57 - 20:01)
especially during The Raid event or the (19:58 - 20:02)
the different yeah the different raid (20:01 - 20:05)
events like oh I have to go hunt like (20:02 - 20:07)
for Missouri now and like take 20 (20:05 - 20:11)
minutes to like do five raids yeah (20:07 - 20:13)
um so I I'm definitely enjoying the new (20:11 - 20:15)
aspect of it and it just yeah it (20:13 - 20:17)
definitely feels a lot more interactive (20:15 - 20:19)
and it almost feels like the Pokemon go (20:17 - 20:21)
raid where like you're all kind of doing (20:19 - 20:23)
it together at the same time like but (20:21 - 20:25)
it's better in that we're not just (20:23 - 20:28)
like viciously tapping our house (20:25 - 20:31)
exactly exactly and I like because it's (20:28 - 20:34)
not just offensive you worry about like (20:31 - 20:35)
you can actually have someone on your (20:34 - 20:38)
team you can say hey your goal is to (20:35 - 20:39)
heal us your goal is to give us that (20:38 - 20:43)
boost so you you actually go into these (20:39 - 20:44)
with more strategies I actually have a (20:43 - 20:46)
team together and strategize saying hey (20:44 - 20:49)
this is like five six star raid where (20:46 - 20:51)
make it swamp we may die a lot because (20:49 - 20:54)
you get you get penalized if you if you (20:51 - 20:56)
faint in these raids like you lose time (20:54 - 20:58)
on your clock so I think if you have one (20:56 - 21:00)
person who's like focusing on healing (20:58 - 21:02)
and giving you that boost I think it has (21:00 - 21:06)
more strategy and more uh involvement to (21:02 - 21:08)
what you said Bev instead of just (21:06 - 21:10)
tapping the screw it tapping the screen (21:08 - 21:12)
at the screen get my boosted move but (21:10 - 21:13)
now you actually have to say okay maybe (21:12 - 21:15)
instead of attacking I'll be more (21:13 - 21:18)
defensive and heal my uh colleagues uh (21:15 - 21:20)
within the battle (21:18 - 21:22)
yeah I'm curious if they uh (21:20 - 21:25)
underestimated the popularity of raids (21:22 - 21:29)
or just how hard trainers will go into (21:25 - 21:30)
raids because (21:29 - 21:31)
um (21:30 - 21:33)
like what a five-star raid ended up (21:31 - 21:36)
being what like level 65 or something uh (21:33 - 21:38)
and I don't think there was really (21:36 - 21:41)
besides like the metoo or the Zara Aura (21:38 - 21:43)
and maybe like some of the urshifu raids (21:41 - 21:45)
like there wasn't really a huge (21:43 - 21:46)
challenge at a certain point in those (21:45 - 21:47)
games obviously like maybe when you (21:46 - 21:48)
start playing and you don't have strong (21:47 - 21:50)
Pokemon (21:48 - 21:51)
um I don't know if you guys have tried a (21:50 - 21:53)
five star in this one uh but they're (21:51 - 21:55)
like closer to like level 75 and a six (21:53 - 21:58)
stars like closer to like 85 with you (21:55 - 22:00)
know they they said that when Charizard (21:58 - 22:03)
comes it would be like level 100 so (22:00 - 22:06)
Seven Star rates should be level 100 but (22:03 - 22:09)
uh like I even struggled with four star (22:06 - 22:13)
raids and and I did a five-star raid for (22:09 - 22:15)
a new Pokemon (22:13 - 22:18)
um and I was I was maybe level 30 or I (22:15 - 22:21)
was maybe level 40. so and everyone else (22:18 - 22:22)
was the appropriate level because they (22:21 - 22:25)
were like oh well hard carry me I was (22:22 - 22:27)
like right yeah let's get carried here (22:25 - 22:29)
no pressure I'm here for it I just want (22:27 - 22:31)
to catch it no big deal (22:29 - 22:33)
um and I did like the defensive thing I (22:31 - 22:34)
knew I was I like it was obvious after (22:33 - 22:36)
attacking once I was like oh I'm not I'm (22:34 - 22:38)
not doing damage like this like I'll (22:36 - 22:39)
I'll hit the cheer button like don't (22:38 - 22:42)
worry guys I'll I'll heal you I'll I'll (22:39 - 22:44)
boost your attacks (22:42 - 22:47)
um and it didn't it didn't work like I (22:44 - 22:49)
kept getting targeted and uh every time (22:47 - 22:52)
I died the clock went down and we we (22:49 - 22:56)
failed out and it's it's funny and maybe (22:52 - 22:58)
it's just because the game is so new but (22:56 - 23:03)
how difficult these can be versus what (22:58 - 23:05)
seemed like just a complete Cake walk (23:03 - 23:07)
with the the normal raids and sword and (23:05 - 23:10)
[ __ ] like again I I feel like they they (23:07 - 23:13)
were like oh maybe our players do know (23:10 - 23:16)
what they're doing and they they just (23:13 - 23:18)
don't want to hit like the hydro pump (23:16 - 23:20)
button over and over again I did a five (23:18 - 23:24)
star for the first time I think of last (23:20 - 23:28)
night and it wiped us I I just sat there (23:24 - 23:30)
going I'm just gonna accept that I'm (23:28 - 23:32)
gonna lose here because it still had I (23:30 - 23:34)
think half the help and then it was (23:32 - 23:37)
maybe like 10 seconds left so at that (23:34 - 23:40)
point I'm like just going in brute force (23:37 - 23:42)
is not going to work in a lot of these (23:40 - 23:44)
raids so when we get those seven star (23:42 - 23:46)
raids coming with like Charizard (23:44 - 23:50)
I don't know what the ideal level is (23:46 - 23:52)
going to be but I feel like you really (23:50 - 23:54)
need to be on your A game here and I (23:52 - 23:56)
actually like this because I I know over (23:54 - 23:58)
the years you know people like oh you (23:56 - 23:59)
know Pokemon games you know we we need (23:58 - 24:01)
to have some difficulty or and then you (23:59 - 24:03)
know we can we can kind of argue and say (24:01 - 24:04)
well you make the game as difficult as (24:03 - 24:06)
you want because you can choose how you (24:04 - 24:09)
play the game but this feature actually (24:06 - 24:11)
was the first time in a while where I'm (24:09 - 24:13)
like I don't know what to do I don't (24:11 - 24:16)
know how to do this am I just dumb is my (24:13 - 24:18)
25 plus music Pokemon experience just (24:16 - 24:20)
down the drain (24:18 - 24:23)
well I remember the like the me too (24:20 - 24:25)
raids were were some you know when when (24:23 - 24:27)
I when I was doing raids with the (24:25 - 24:30)
community and you know we would do I (24:27 - 24:33)
don't know like a gigantomatic Lapras (24:30 - 24:34)
and you know people you'd have three (24:33 - 24:36)
people bring in like azashian or (24:34 - 24:37)
something and then one person would (24:36 - 24:38)
bring in like a Sinister and it's like (24:37 - 24:41)
uh yep no big deal right we'll still get (24:38 - 24:42)
it not that big of a deal they just want (24:41 - 24:45)
to flex their citizen see cool whatever (24:42 - 24:46)
um (24:45 - 24:48)
and then with the Mewtwo you couldn't do (24:46 - 24:49)
that when Mewtwo came out in sword and (24:48 - 24:51)
shield you just couldn't do that and it (24:49 - 24:55)
was like it was uh like a puzzle to (24:51 - 24:56)
figure out okay well if I bring this (24:55 - 24:58)
Pokemon and you bring this Pokemon we (24:56 - 25:00)
should be able to do it I think the the (24:58 - 25:02)
secret to Mewtwo is if one person had (25:00 - 25:04)
like a marshadow because of our shadows (25:02 - 25:07)
move spectral Thief it made it (25:04 - 25:11)
significantly easier to do Mewtwo (25:07 - 25:14)
um and I don't I wonder if that's like (25:11 - 25:17)
the Charizard thing like because I have (25:14 - 25:19)
this Pokemon with this Terror type (25:17 - 25:22)
Charizard's gonna be easier yeah but (25:19 - 25:27)
um yeah like I I'm curious as as we (25:22 - 25:29)
go into week two of scarlet and violet (25:27 - 25:31)
if people are just gonna figure out like (25:29 - 25:33)
these are the three best Pokemon for all (25:31 - 25:35)
raids or or this is the best stereotype (25:33 - 25:36)
or (25:35 - 25:38)
I I don't think that's going to be the (25:36 - 25:39)
case (25:38 - 25:40)
um (25:39 - 25:42)
but at a certain point in in sword and (25:40 - 25:44)
shield you could you could probably get (25:42 - 25:46)
away bringing zashi into most things and (25:44 - 25:48)
be okay unless it was like fire or (25:46 - 25:51)
something (25:48 - 25:51)
yeah I kind of hope it doesn't get to (25:52 - 25:56)
the point where it's just the same three (25:54 - 25:58)
Pokemon because it it did get a little (25:56 - 25:59)
boring just to see like everyone (25:58 - 26:02)
bringing an assassin into this read (25:59 - 26:04)
um I I personally haven't gotten to the (26:02 - 26:07)
five star raids yet but I did lose a (26:04 - 26:10)
three star raid today because I missed (26:07 - 26:13)
judge what typing my Pokemon was and I (26:10 - 26:14)
just kept getting one shot it's like oh (26:13 - 26:15)
this is (26:14 - 26:18)
this is this is great (26:15 - 26:20)
um I don't think I've ever lost a (26:18 - 26:22)
three-star raid before in Jordan Shield (26:20 - 26:24)
so (26:22 - 26:26)
uh yeah I think I'm definitely seeing (26:24 - 26:28)
the difficulty Factor has definitely (26:26 - 26:30)
increased yeah (26:28 - 26:32)
um (26:30 - 26:34)
okay let's uh I think there's a perfect (26:32 - 26:36)
perfect time to take a break uh when we (26:34 - 26:38)
get back from our break we're gonna talk (26:36 - 26:41)
about uh uh some sales numbers because (26:38 - 26:42)
it seems like uh (26:41 - 26:46)
the games that sold pretty well here (26:42 - 26:48)
um and also there were some awards and a (26:46 - 26:52)
Legends are Arceus one an award and (26:48 - 26:53)

so on there a lot I believe the other (29:47 - 29:52)
games (29:50 - 29:56)
for Nintendo were Kirby in the Forgotten (29:52 - 29:58)
land (29:56 - 30:00)
um Xenoblade (29:58 - 30:04)
Splatoon 3 and then Pokemon (30:00 - 30:06)
let me see if I I feel like I'm missing (30:04 - 30:09)
a game there (30:06 - 30:09)
um (30:09 - 30:13)
yeah and the Nintendo switch Sports (30:09 - 30:17)
which did did the switch have slim (30:13 - 30:19)
pickings this year apparently it must (30:17 - 30:21)
have been a tough year for Nintendo (30:19 - 30:23)
looks like (30:21 - 30:23)
yeah this game came out in January like (30:24 - 30:29)
it feels forever that oh we've we've (30:26 - 30:32)
played our kids yeah January 28th I (30:29 - 30:33)
think (30:32 - 30:35)
um something like that uh so yeah you (30:33 - 30:37)
know the internet was mad uh you know (30:35 - 30:41)
Splatoon 3 players in shambles uh you (30:37 - 30:43)
know I've only heard good things about (30:41 - 30:47)
Xenoblade but also I don't that's like (30:43 - 30:48)
the the 40 people out there that bought (30:47 - 30:50)
Xenoblade (30:48 - 30:52)
um I'm sure there's more I just I've (30:50 - 30:55)
just never been a Xenoblade fan same (30:52 - 30:57)
um it just yeah just I don't know it has (30:55 - 30:59)
never appealed to me (30:57 - 31:02)
um Kirby to me has never felt like a (30:59 - 31:04)
game of the year kind of game Kirby's (31:02 - 31:06)
just always felt like this like yeah (31:04 - 31:08)
it's cute it's great comes out every two (31:06 - 31:10)
to three years people like it but this (31:08 - 31:13)
one yeah but I think this one that came (31:10 - 31:15)
out because and I will say that that was (31:13 - 31:17)
my first this is true my first Kirby (31:15 - 31:19)
game I ever played was at Forbidden (31:17 - 31:21)
Island game and you know it felt really (31:19 - 31:23)
good like it got it has a nice twist to (31:21 - 31:26)
it I felt like it was not a traditional (31:23 - 31:28)
Kirby game like I had like the core of (31:26 - 31:30)
like like the the (31:28 - 31:32)
um the charm behind it I would say but (31:30 - 31:35)
if don't really like a fun game to play (31:32 - 31:36)
like I fished in a couple of days and I (31:35 - 31:38)
and I loved it so (31:36 - 31:40)
I just heard about it it's kind of like (31:38 - 31:42)
Legends of the breath of the wild where (31:40 - 31:44)
if it's the first like thing you've (31:42 - 31:45)
played you're not going to want to play (31:44 - 31:47)
other Kirby games just because it's so (31:45 - 31:49)
good yeah I also haven't played Kirby (31:47 - 31:51)
games so I want to play that eventually (31:49 - 31:54)
highly recommend I think you'll love it (31:51 - 31:59)
uh yeah so uh you know I think we've (31:54 - 32:01)
talked about this exhaustively on the (31:59 - 32:05)
show Legends is not a very pretty game (32:01 - 32:07)
um especially compared to some of the (32:05 - 32:08)
games on the list I'm not a huge (32:07 - 32:10)
Splatoon person I full disclosure (32:08 - 32:12)
Nintendo did send me a free copy of (32:10 - 32:16)
Splatoon 3. it looks great feels great I (32:12 - 32:19)
just can't like splatoon's fine I don't (32:16 - 32:20)
think it's a bad game by any means I (32:19 - 32:24)
wish I liked it more I just I just don't (32:20 - 32:26)
I don't think there's anything wrong (32:24 - 32:27)
with it I just don't think it's my type (32:26 - 32:29)
of game (32:27 - 32:32)
um yeah I'm not I'm not sure what their (32:29 - 32:33)
uh (32:32 - 32:36)
uh look I'm not upset Legends one I (32:33 - 32:37)
think it's great game I think it's (32:36 - 32:39)
absolutely fantastic I would recommend (32:37 - 32:41)
it to any Pokemon fan easily I would (32:39 - 32:43)
recommend it to somebody who is just (32:41 - 32:45)
looking for a switch game who may have (32:43 - 32:47)
dabbled in Pokemon (32:45 - 32:49)
um but I wouldn't sugar coat that it's (32:47 - 32:52)
not the prettiest switch game (32:49 - 32:53)
um the draw distance isn't super great (32:52 - 32:56)
but I think the the gameplay Loop that (32:53 - 32:58)
that game offers is fantastic (32:56 - 33:01)
um also I guess maybe I wouldn't uh I (32:58 - 33:03)
wouldn't tell the the one main reason I (33:01 - 33:05)
wouldn't recommend it to somebody is if (33:03 - 33:07)
they said like man I love battling (33:05 - 33:10)
Pokemon like this is there ain't no (33:07 - 33:11)
there ain't no training battles in this (33:10 - 33:13)
game man you gotta love catching Pokemon (33:11 - 33:16)
yeah I I actually still (33:13 - 33:19)
um and I had a co-worker of mine um was (33:16 - 33:20)
like Hey I wanna get a Pokemon game for (33:19 - 33:23)
uh my son like his first Pokemon game on (33:20 - 33:25)
the switch what do I get and immediately (33:23 - 33:28)
I said you gotta let's go like I still (33:25 - 33:30)
recommend let's go Pikachu let's go (33:28 - 33:32)
Eevee as like the first Pokemon game on (33:30 - 33:33)
the switch because if you want that (33:32 - 33:36)
traditional Pokemon experience like you (33:33 - 33:38)
may have played before that's still a (33:36 - 33:41)
great game I think with uh RCS uh What (33:38 - 33:43)
uh I liked about it and maybe that's (33:41 - 33:47)
quality criteria y1 was that it try (33:43 - 33:49)
something new with the formula or it (33:47 - 33:50)
kind of like took a step back and said (33:49 - 33:52)
hey you know what let's offer another (33:50 - 33:54)
type of Pokemon experience to those who (33:52 - 33:56)
may not be into the whole like get the (33:54 - 33:59)
gym badges battle trainers because we (33:56 - 34:00)
know in this game like you said Steve (33:59 - 34:02)
there's like six battles like you battle (34:00 - 34:05)
six people or one person five times but (34:02 - 34:07)
a lot of just you just catch Pokemon it (34:05 - 34:09)
has that let's go feeling that you try (34:07 - 34:11)
to get people like with the let's go PG (34:09 - 34:13)
let's go Eevee people playing Pokemon go (34:11 - 34:15)
say hey you just like catching Pokemon (34:13 - 34:17)
here's a game for you and I think that's (34:15 - 34:20)
why RCS I like it because it's just a (34:17 - 34:22)
different formula with the uh with the (34:20 - 34:24)
Pokemon uh company (34:22 - 34:26)
yeah and it took the same region and (34:24 - 34:28)
just gave it a whole new spin which I (34:26 - 34:31)
would I really enjoyed I hope they do (34:28 - 34:33)
this with a lot of some of the other (34:31 - 34:35)
gens some of the other regions I would (34:33 - 34:37)
love to go back and and learn about (34:35 - 34:40)
either like different lore meet new (34:37 - 34:42)
people or meet like the the ancestors of (34:40 - 34:45)
people we already know like Cynthia's (34:42 - 34:46)
great great great great (34:45 - 34:49)
I don't know (34:46 - 34:49)
she has like five ancestors I think (34:50 - 34:54)
right every game going forward this is (34:52 - 34:56)
Cynthia's and her grandma her Grandma's (34:54 - 34:59)
Grandma her father's second cousin twice (34:56 - 35:01)
for me (34:59 - 35:01)
yes I just need to know her whole family (35:02 - 35:08)
her next game Pokemon Legends Cynthia's (35:05 - 35:09)
family tree coming soon (35:08 - 35:11)
[Laughter] (35:09 - 35:13)
I'm gonna say like um Pokemon like the (35:11 - 35:16)
DNA test oh yeah you related Cynthia (35:13 - 35:17)
somehow in these games because it goes (35:16 - 35:20)
back way far (35:17 - 35:22)
um yeah (35:20 - 35:25)
I'm sorry (35:22 - 35:25)
go ahead I was gonna say they could do (35:25 - 35:31)
like the one uh like time Loop like (35:28 - 35:32)
gimmick where like you go back in time (35:31 - 35:34)
and it's like the same actor who's (35:32 - 35:36)
playing the same like they look exactly (35:34 - 35:37)
the same so we'll do that but with (35:36 - 35:39)
Cynthia (35:37 - 35:43)
oh I like it (35:39 - 35:46)
yeah I mean uh I I (35:43 - 35:48)
obviously Graphics are not the only (35:46 - 35:50)
thing that these games are judged on I I (35:48 - 35:52)
feel like with with all the (35:50 - 35:54)
conversations around (35:52 - 35:56)
um scarlet and violet and even around (35:54 - 36:00)
Legends Arceus it's I I think totally (35:56 - 36:02)
fair to be like hey this game looks ugly (36:00 - 36:04)
this game looks muddy hey it's a little (36:02 - 36:06)
chunky but there are other things that (36:04 - 36:09)
go into the game uh I think why going (36:06 - 36:11)
into the next article we're about to (36:09 - 36:12)
read (36:11 - 36:12)
um (36:12 - 36:15)
uh why Pokemon games are are still sell (36:12 - 36:18)
well regardless of you know them looking (36:15 - 36:21)
bad recently uh is they have a great (36:18 - 36:23)
gameplay Loop and (36:21 - 36:25)
um another thing not talked about is (36:23 - 36:27)
like they've they've been really (36:25 - 36:28)
knocking into the park with the music (36:27 - 36:31)
the last couple games as well (36:28 - 36:33)
um so yeah I first thing that comes to (36:31 - 36:34)
mind is (36:33 - 36:36)
Arceus is probably the ugliest game on (36:34 - 36:41)
this list I agree 100 agree yep but uh (36:36 - 36:43)
yeah I I don't know what their criteria (36:41 - 36:46)
for for judging here is but (36:43 - 36:49)
um I I don't know I don't I know (36:46 - 36:51)
Xenoblade is like a jrpg I know you (36:49 - 36:53)
level up I know you have a crew I know (36:51 - 36:54)
you battle giant monsters I know people (36:53 - 36:58)
tout that that game looks very good (36:54 - 37:00)
um I know Kirby's an action adventure (36:58 - 37:02)
game I know Splatoon is your action (37:00 - 37:04)
shooter not really a shooter third (37:02 - 37:08)
person Adventure shooter it is still a (37:04 - 37:09)
shooter (37:08 - 37:10)
um (37:09 - 37:12)
why I still don't know why Nintendo (37:10 - 37:14)
switch Sports was on here what a (37:12 - 37:16)
disappointing game (37:14 - 37:18)
Nintendo did not send that one to me for (37:16 - 37:20)
free I bought that one with my own no I (37:18 - 37:22)
play played three games of bowling and I (37:20 - 37:24)
think that's the extent of my Nintendo (37:22 - 37:28)
switch Sports Experience so far (37:24 - 37:31)
I'll try to I I want to because of the (37:28 - 37:34)
Wii Sports Nostalgia but I yeah just (37:31 - 37:36)
from what I've heard no no thanks yeah (37:34 - 37:38)
the Nostalgia only lasted about a solid (37:36 - 37:41)
hour for me and then I was like (37:38 - 37:43)
move on (37:41 - 37:46)
yep uh this article came out right (37:43 - 37:49)
before we started recording uh this is (37:46 - 37:51)
off of polygon.com Pokemon scarlet and (37:49 - 37:55)
violet sell 10 million copies in spite (37:51 - 37:58)
of performance complaints well I mean (37:55 - 37:59)
other articles just said this will tell (37:58 - 38:01)
many copies but let's you know that's (37:59 - 38:03)
not sugarcoat it uh Nintendo said it was (38:01 - 38:07)
the highest Global sale uh sale level uh (38:03 - 38:10)
on any of the companies for consoles in (38:07 - 38:14)
the first three days since launch (38:10 - 38:16)
um Nintendo said Wednesday the Pokemon (38:14 - 38:17)
scarlet and violet sold more than 10 (38:16 - 38:18)
million copies within the first three (38:17 - 38:20)
days the games were released November (38:18 - 38:22)
18th and since have reached quote the (38:20 - 38:24)
highest Global sales level for any (38:22 - 38:28)
software uh on any Nintendo platform (38:24 - 38:29)
within the first three days in spite of (38:28 - 38:32)
this uh launch there has been a number (38:29 - 38:34)
of serious performance and graphical (38:32 - 38:37)
issues that polygon has listed (38:34 - 38:38)
um (38:37 - 38:40)
it's been a major record-breaking (38:38 - 38:42)
release for Nintendo with a huge with a (38:40 - 38:44)
surpassing a huge launch with Pokemon (38:42 - 38:46)
sword and shield trees could not hold (38:44 - 38:49)
that game behind uh the Pokemon (38:46 - 38:51)
company's eighth generation games have (38:49 - 38:55)
sold six million copies uh over the (38:51 - 38:57)
launch weekend they say weekend I'm (38:55 - 38:58)
assuming they're comparing it to again (38:57 - 39:01)
the first three days but (38:58 - 39:04)
uh because Friday Saturday Sunday uh (39:01 - 39:06)
with record-breaking sales however the (39:04 - 39:08)
Pokemon company seems to have one of its (39:06 - 39:10)
buggiest launches yet uh Pokemon scarlet (39:08 - 39:12)
and violet uh launched with Pokemon and (39:10 - 39:15)
NPC pop-ins frame rate issues uh and (39:12 - 39:17)
character and Pokemon clipping through (39:15 - 39:19)
the world (39:17 - 39:23)
um and I I can't remember (39:19 - 39:25)
I have remembered video games where like (39:23 - 39:27)
they'll do side by side comparisons and (39:25 - 39:30)
they'll they'll show like behind I think (39:27 - 39:31)
maybe cyberpunk was probably actually (39:30 - 39:32)
the last game where people were like (39:31 - 39:35)
this game is terribly broken here but I (39:32 - 39:37)
can't remember a Nintendo game they've (39:35 - 39:39)
done that too but yes like digital (39:37 - 39:43)
Foundry IGN they all had very in tensive (39:39 - 39:44)
reviews of (39:43 - 39:47)
this game is running very poorly (39:44 - 39:48)
um (39:47 - 39:52)
and I think it was at least in my (39:48 - 39:54)
circles you know being a content creator (39:52 - 39:56)
uh streaming the game the weekend of (39:54 - 40:00)
twitch uh it's kind of all I heard yep (39:56 - 40:02)
yep (40:00 - 40:05)
uh but at the same time (40:02 - 40:08)
I can't stop playing it (40:05 - 40:13)
yeah okay it's good despite despite the (40:08 - 40:14)
bugs (40:13 - 40:16)
and I did click on this link to watch (40:14 - 40:20)
all the videos and they're all hilarious (40:16 - 40:23)
oh the bugs yeah yeah (40:20 - 40:25)
my favorite was the last one with like (40:23 - 40:29)
the giant uh Deli bird (40:25 - 40:29)
I think I think the bugs also (40:29 - 40:34)
um and you know and like we mentioned (40:32 - 40:36)
before it has bugs it has the glitches (40:34 - 40:39)
it has the frame rate issues but I think (40:36 - 40:40)
the charm of the game is still there (40:39 - 40:43)
like I like I'm laughing a lot at seeing (40:40 - 40:45)
some of these bugs happen but (40:43 - 40:48)
to see what you just said I can't stop (40:45 - 40:51)
playing this game I just still like love (40:48 - 40:54)
exploring paldea I love going in an open (40:51 - 40:57)
field finding a bunch of Pokemon bowing (40:54 - 40:58)
them catching them (40:57 - 41:02)
I still think the um character (40:58 - 41:04)
representation in this game is fantastic (41:02 - 41:06)
like you have you know different uh (41:04 - 41:07)
backgrounds different races different (41:06 - 41:10)
body types it's absolutely great with (41:07 - 41:13)
what game freak did with that (41:10 - 41:14)
um it's unfortunate that yes you have (41:13 - 41:16)
these issues popping up but I think the (41:14 - 41:19)
charm of the game is still there and I (41:16 - 41:20)
do believe this is fixable the question (41:19 - 41:22)
is when do you think we'll get this (41:20 - 41:24)
fixed do you think you know like will we (41:22 - 41:26)
get something coming out before (41:24 - 41:28)
Christmas when a bunch of these people (41:26 - 41:30)
may get this as a as a gift possibly (41:28 - 41:34)
like I'm I'm curious about that (41:30 - 41:34)
yeah I think there's like no doubt that (41:34 - 41:39)
the well I I think every game is rushed (41:36 - 41:42)
I think every game has a deadline uh (41:39 - 41:43)
every game has to go out the door I (41:42 - 41:45)
don't know if I've said this on the (41:43 - 41:47)
podcast I've talked a lot this week I've (41:45 - 41:49)
streamed like 60 hours and I've recorded (41:47 - 41:50)
like five shows so I'm not sure where (41:49 - 41:52)
what I've said where (41:50 - 41:53)
um but you know I used to work at what I (41:52 - 41:56)
used to work on websites before I moved (41:53 - 41:57)
into content creation and we would have (41:56 - 41:59)
the big boss who didn't understand how (41:57 - 42:02)
websites worked because he didn't go to (41:59 - 42:04)
school for that or learn that and he (42:02 - 42:05)
would be like I want this brand new (42:04 - 42:08)
website by December and I was like (42:05 - 42:10)
that's not enough time and he was like (42:08 - 42:13)
get it done I was like okay because what (42:10 - 42:15)
else am I gonna do just quit the (42:13 - 42:17)
paycheck and he would be like I want (42:15 - 42:19)
these eight things and you'd have to be (42:17 - 42:22)
like I I if you want this done (42:19 - 42:25)
I can do six of these yeah and like I (42:22 - 42:27)
can't I can't do all of them and you (42:25 - 42:29)
know when you get closer to launch you (42:27 - 42:31)
realize I I there's just me there's just (42:29 - 42:32)
me and one other guy working on this (42:31 - 42:34)
website we you know we probably could (42:32 - 42:35)
have got six of the eight done If you (42:34 - 42:37)
hired like two more people but you (42:35 - 42:40)
didn't so uh now we can only get five of (42:37 - 42:41)
the things done (42:40 - 42:45)
um and and at least in my situation and (42:41 - 42:47)
I don't know if this rule again I don't (42:45 - 42:48)
know if this is relatable to game (42:47 - 42:49)
development they always wanted something (42:48 - 42:51)
new too like I remember we were (42:49 - 42:53)
launching a website a month before Black (42:51 - 42:55)
Friday and they were like we want a (42:53 - 42:58)
Rewards program and I was like (42:55 - 43:00)
I've never implemented this like I gotta (42:58 - 43:02)
teach myself how to do this I gotta (43:00 - 43:04)
install it like we already building a (43:02 - 43:06)
News website for pretty much scratch (43:04 - 43:10)
because we move platforms and I was like (43:06 - 43:13)
this is not something you roll out a (43:10 - 43:16)
month before Black Friday like in no way (43:13 - 43:17)
like (43:16 - 43:19)
because if it breaks you're just you're (43:17 - 43:21)
just destroying your own sales like No (43:19 - 43:22)
One's Gonna Come to the website and try (43:21 - 43:26)
to shop if anyways (43:22 - 43:27)
I don't think there has been a single (43:26 - 43:29)
website I ever launched in the six plus (43:27 - 43:31)
years I was doing that job that didn't (43:29 - 43:32)
feel like (43:31 - 43:35)
we got to get this out the door and and (43:32 - 43:37)
these four things are broken but we will (43:35 - 43:39)
fix them uh after the fact like they're (43:37 - 43:41)
not as broken as (43:39 - 43:44)
the the website was still wrong we just (43:41 - 43:48)
these ain't gonna be done in time and (43:44 - 43:51)
it's no but you're exactly right so in (43:48 - 43:53)
my day job I'm a software developer and (43:51 - 43:56)
I understand salt like these (43:53 - 43:58)
it's it's easy to say I want this (43:56 - 44:02)
request but the work that is involved to (43:58 - 44:04)
get the request to what we call product (44:02 - 44:06)
it's production it's a lie for you to (44:04 - 44:07)
see it (44:06 - 44:11)
has to go through extensive training we (44:07 - 44:14)
do automated testing we do QA you know (44:11 - 44:15)
behind like a staging environment so (44:14 - 44:17)
people can see hey this is what it looks (44:15 - 44:18)
like if we push alive oh we found (44:17 - 44:20)
another we found three more bugs okay (44:18 - 44:22)
now let's go back and fix that so to (44:20 - 44:25)
your point you're exactly right is that (44:22 - 44:28)
the the process is so meticulous because (44:25 - 44:30)
you may think a request is easy get a (44:28 - 44:33)
website up but there's so much stuff (44:30 - 44:35)
under that Iceberg underneath the (44:33 - 44:37)
surface of the water that goes on behind (44:35 - 44:39)
the scenes and I feel like (44:37 - 44:41)
with this example with uh scarlet and (44:39 - 44:43)
violet I'm sure there was some stuff (44:41 - 44:45)
that was missed in QA I'm sure that they (44:43 - 44:46)
want to get some features out or they (44:45 - 44:48)
added something the last minute they may (44:46 - 44:51)
have missed a check box on the Excel (44:48 - 44:52)
spreadsheet that says hey did you check (44:51 - 44:53)
for this and maybe they didn't check it (44:52 - 44:55)
so and those mistakes do happen and you (44:53 - 44:57)
can go back and fix it but I feel like (44:55 - 45:00)
to set that expedition forward is that (44:57 - 45:02)
it does take time to roll out like (45:00 - 45:03)
releases like we like my company (45:02 - 45:06)
launched a brand new website it took (45:03 - 45:08)
over two and a half years now not again (45:06 - 45:10)
Kobe didn't help but at the same time (45:08 - 45:12)
there was so many things we had to plan (45:10 - 45:14)
for ahead of time and do quality testing (45:12 - 45:16)
and bugs still pop up but we but we can (45:14 - 45:18)
address them faster because now we have (45:16 - 45:20)
a product that's out there that's (45:18 - 45:22)
working so yeah I wish there was more (45:20 - 45:24)
time with this but to your point Steve (45:22 - 45:26)
there's someone at the top saying here's (45:24 - 45:30)
the date get it out (45:26 - 45:30)
see the that's like the opposite of how (45:31 - 45:35)
it works in the government you'll have (45:33 - 45:36)
like the political saying we want this (45:35 - 45:37)
by the end of this week and we're like (45:36 - 45:40)
no it's going to take two years (45:37 - 45:40)
and they have no say and it's just gonna (45:40 - 45:45)
take that long and we're just gonna push (45:43 - 45:46)
the date back and they're just gonna (45:45 - 45:49)
have to be happy with it so maybe maybe (45:46 - 45:51)
Pokemon needs to start acting like a (45:49 - 45:53)
government and being like no we're gonna (45:51 - 45:54)
take as long as we need to because (45:53 - 45:56)
there's so much red tape and so many (45:54 - 45:59)
levels of review that needs to goes to (45:56 - 46:01)
government Pikachu I'm here for it (45:59 - 46:04)
and I'm not going to sit here and defend (46:01 - 46:06)
game freak or the Pokemon company or (46:04 - 46:09)
Nintendo um I understand what's what's (46:06 - 46:11)
happening I think I think a lot of (46:09 - 46:12)
people do especially if they listen to (46:11 - 46:14)
the show the problem with delaying the (46:12 - 46:17)
game six months or which I think they (46:14 - 46:18)
should for the record or delay it (46:17 - 46:21)
somehow is the Pokemon unlike other (46:18 - 46:24)
franchises run they run on this huge (46:21 - 46:27)
machine that is the anime that is the (46:24 - 46:30)
TCG that is their merchandise and if you (46:27 - 46:33)
delay your game six months and your your (46:30 - 46:37)
anime starts your paldaya anime starts (46:33 - 46:38)
um (46:37 - 46:41)
that's weird because uh no one's playing (46:38 - 46:43)
that game or if you're if you're paldea (46:41 - 46:45)
cards are coming out three months before (46:43 - 46:48)
the game came out uh that's also weird (46:45 - 46:53)
again not trying to defend but I think (46:48 - 46:55)
there is like an artificial deadline (46:53 - 46:57)
that they they worked themselves into (46:55 - 46:59)
and maybe maybe there is like a boss up (46:57 - 47:01)
there being like hey maybe can we get (46:59 - 47:05)
another month or two and it's just no we (47:01 - 47:07)
can't because like we've worked (47:05 - 47:09)
ourselves into TCG sets every three (47:07 - 47:10)
months (47:09 - 47:13)
um in the US every month in Japan anime (47:10 - 47:16)
Starts Here ends here we take like a (47:13 - 47:19)
month off for for summer like there's (47:16 - 47:22)
just so many things happening (47:19 - 47:24)
and I don't know I don't know what the (47:22 - 47:26)
after math is like is the are they (47:24 - 47:27)
working on DLC (47:26 - 47:30)
um you know people are saying yes (47:27 - 47:32)
uh the the original data miners are like (47:30 - 47:34)
yep there's there's all this foundation (47:32 - 47:36)
for DLC there's things in the game that (47:34 - 47:40)
hints for DLC the oh for the sake of (47:36 - 47:42)
clothing alone we can only hope that DLC (47:40 - 47:45)
will let us change the clothing but (47:42 - 47:47)
um (47:45 - 47:47)
if if the DLC was planned as fast as the (47:47 - 47:53)
Isle of armor and Crown Tundra I don't (47:50 - 47:54)
think there's a single Pokemon fan out (47:53 - 47:56)
there that wouldn't be like I'm okay (47:54 - 47:58)
waiting can we just fix what we have (47:56 - 48:00)
here first because what you have here is (47:58 - 48:03)
there's something special here (48:00 - 48:04)
uh and I want to complete continue (48:03 - 48:07)
playing this game for three years and (48:04 - 48:10)
right now it it can be tough I know some (48:07 - 48:12)
people they don't care about any of the (48:10 - 48:15)
issues yeah totally cool respect that I (48:12 - 48:18)
as a day one destiny player I uh power (48:15 - 48:20)
through every day of that game and (48:18 - 48:21)
people were like there's too many issues (48:20 - 48:23)
I'm not playing Destiny I and a bunch of (48:21 - 48:25)
people came back for the taken King and (48:23 - 48:26)
I was like Destiny was good the whole (48:25 - 48:30)
time but look it wasn't I understood but (48:26 - 48:32)
I loved that gameplay Loop maybe I just (48:30 - 48:34)
like bad games (48:32 - 48:35)
um (48:34 - 48:38)
I think the real shocking thing too is (48:35 - 48:40)
like seeing scarlet and violet side by (48:38 - 48:45)
side against Arceus and just how much (48:40 - 48:48)
better Arceus looks it's it's really (48:45 - 48:51)
jarring that because we literally (48:48 - 48:54)
started the the the start of this (48:51 - 48:56)
episode being like yeah Arceus is ugly (48:54 - 48:59)
uh but it looks so much better than (48:56 - 49:01)
Scarlet Violet that's not to say I I (48:59 - 49:03)
think Scarlet Violet has a couple (49:01 - 49:05)
moments of being very pretty (49:03 - 49:09)
um but uh those moments are far and few (49:05 - 49:11)
between when you're (49:09 - 49:13)
strutting through the desert trying to (49:11 - 49:15)
like find a (49:13 - 49:17)
silicobra (49:15 - 49:19)
I meant to ask you what's your thoughts (49:17 - 49:21)
on the water I I haven't heard you take (49:19 - 49:23)
on the water in this game yet (49:21 - 49:25)
uh (49:23 - 49:27)
it's okay (49:25 - 49:29)
I like how they have a reflection now (49:27 - 49:32)
that's that's good it's liquid it's good (49:29 - 49:34)
yeah it's moving it's moving I think the (49:32 - 49:37)
rocks have a more liquid quality than (49:34 - 49:38)
the than the water have you seen the (49:37 - 49:41)
Rocks just kind of like wave in and out (49:38 - 49:42)
a little bit (49:41 - 49:45)
I will say the the terror raid ends uh (49:42 - 49:47)
but they're pretty looking I think I (49:45 - 49:49)
think they did a good job with the um (49:47 - 49:51)
the crystallization of the uh (49:49 - 49:53)
terrazolizing crowns and the Pokemon (49:51 - 49:56)
itself and if you enter Raiden it's (49:53 - 49:59)
really sparkly and it has that um luxury (49:56 - 50:01)
feel coming off of it and like to your (49:59 - 50:02)
point Steve yeah parts of these games (50:01 - 50:05)
they look great if at the right angle (50:02 - 50:07)
with the sun coming in during battle you (50:05 - 50:09)
have that glare coming in uh the Blue (50:07 - 50:13)
Sky the the the the sweeping the grass (50:09 - 50:15)
is sweeping it looks really nice but I'm (50:13 - 50:17)
glad you mentioned our uh RCS because (50:15 - 50:19)
and even I was just thinking about this (50:17 - 50:20)
the other day (50:19 - 50:24)
and I may boot up um sword and shield I (50:20 - 50:26)
don't recall a lot of issues like this (50:24 - 50:28)
even in sword and shield I think it's (50:26 - 50:30)
from the get-go yeah there were some (50:28 - 50:31)
issues with frame rate stuff in like the (50:30 - 50:32)
wild area especially if you're online (50:31 - 50:34)
and people are you know coming in to (50:32 - 50:37)
join you but I didn't remember a lot of (50:34 - 50:39)
that even in that game I remember just (50:37 - 50:43)
the wild area being a huge slog the (50:39 - 50:45)
first week or so of that game and I want (50:43 - 50:47)
to I want to say that there was like (50:45 - 50:50)
something where like you (50:47 - 50:52)
maybe they put out an update or I don't (50:50 - 50:54)
remember I mean I I probably talked (50:52 - 50:56)
about it at some point (50:54 - 50:58)
um but I felt like at like everyone (50:56 - 51:00)
complained about the wild area chugging (50:58 - 51:04)
and being slow that first two maybe even (51:00 - 51:05)
three weeks and then all of a sudden (51:04 - 51:08)
maybe I maybe we all just got so numb to (51:05 - 51:09)
it but I felt like there was like a (51:08 - 51:11)
clicking point where it's like oh the (51:09 - 51:12)
wild area runs better all of a sudden (51:11 - 51:14)
yeah (51:12 - 51:16)
um but maybe again maybe I'm just (51:14 - 51:21)
blinded by big papa Pokemon uh (51:16 - 51:24)
in that sense (51:21 - 51:24)
I don't know yeah I I would definitely (51:26 - 51:31)
be okay with waiting until you know they (51:28 - 51:33)
get this done before I get DLC because (51:31 - 51:35)
it doesn't make any sense to add more to (51:33 - 51:39)
un already really glitchy thing and you (51:35 - 51:41)
know maybe that's their their you know (51:39 - 51:44)
their their fix is (51:41 - 51:46)
um with the whole like scheduling thing (51:44 - 51:48)
like they can introduce a new region (51:46 - 51:51)
within a region and then build to anime (51:48 - 51:55)
around the DLC and you know they I feel (51:51 - 51:56)
like there's there's definitely things (51:55 - 51:58)
they can do to adjust that to to (51:56 - 52:00)
lengthen the time between games but I (51:58 - 52:02)
don't know (52:00 - 52:04)
um even despite despite all these (52:02 - 52:06)
glitches like y'all have said I I've (52:04 - 52:08)
enjoyed it uh the ray dents are (52:06 - 52:11)
beautiful the roaming raid the roaming (52:08 - 52:13)
Tara Pokemon (52:11 - 52:14)
is awful (52:13 - 52:17)
um when they terrazolize and it's a (52:14 - 52:22)
little sparkly grass it's just terrible (52:17 - 52:22)
yeah I I (52:22 - 52:25)
said this (52:25 - 52:30)
you know the first (52:28 - 52:33)
day I played the game like it's the only (52:30 - 52:35)
reason it's hard for me to recommend (52:33 - 52:38)
this game is because I felt that people (52:35 - 52:41)
have been burned on Pokemon in one way (52:38 - 52:43)
or another whether whether it's too easy (52:41 - 52:45)
whether it's too linear whether it's too (52:43 - 52:48)
glitchy whether the trees weren't good (52:45 - 52:50)
enough whether it was the national decks (52:48 - 52:52)
I felt like there have been a lot of (52:50 - 52:54)
players that have been burned on Pokemon (52:52 - 52:57)
one way or another and if they're asking (52:54 - 52:59)
if this is the game they should come (52:57 - 53:02)
back to that is hard for me to say yes (52:59 - 53:03)
to because I just don't want to see them (53:02 - 53:05)
burned again when you get burned twice (53:03 - 53:06)
probably not going to give the game a (53:05 - 53:08)
third chance (53:06 - 53:11)
um so if if they were to do a big update (53:08 - 53:14)
um and and Patch falling through the (53:11 - 53:18)
ground patch uh the the (53:14 - 53:22)
the chugginess patch the little weird (53:18 - 53:24)
Pokeball that appears in the doorway (53:22 - 53:26)
that it starts following you around like (53:24 - 53:28)
a ghost like I don't know if you've seen (53:26 - 53:29)
that that one I've seen what happens (53:28 - 53:32)
yeah that one that was weird (53:29 - 53:32)
it would be easier to recommend because (53:33 - 53:37)
I do think the loop (53:34 - 53:40)
uh the loop of the game itself is good (53:37 - 53:42)
and uh and the one thing we haven't (53:40 - 53:43)
talked about I think on any of the (53:42 - 53:45)
episodes is that the co-op actually (53:43 - 53:48)
works and it works pretty well like you (53:45 - 53:50)
would think that connecting with four (53:48 - 53:51)
other people in this huge open world (53:50 - 53:53)
that is already buggy and is already (53:51 - 53:54)
frame ready and I was already pretty (53:53 - 53:56)
ugly you would think that like oh I'm (53:54 - 53:58)
going down from 15 frames to 10 frames (53:56 - 53:59)
because like four other people in my (53:58 - 54:02)
world but surprisingly that works (53:59 - 54:03)
incredibly well (54:02 - 54:05)
um and having other people in your world (54:03 - 54:08)
is like it's a novelty I don't know if (54:05 - 54:11)
it's going to be like must play it this (54:08 - 54:13)
way all the time but that was also like (54:11 - 54:15)
it reminded me of of Destiny again of (54:13 - 54:18)
the knob like I would get from my nine (54:15 - 54:20)
to five job I would get off work where I (54:18 - 54:22)
was making websites I would sit down (54:20 - 54:24)
within like an hour will would jump on (54:22 - 54:26)
and then somebody else would jump on and (54:24 - 54:27)
we would ride our sparrows through (54:26 - 54:29)
Destiny collecting materials because we (54:27 - 54:30)
enjoyed that gameplay Loop and we (54:29 - 54:32)
enjoyed play and it wasn't like we (54:30 - 54:33)
didn't need to be together like there (54:32 - 54:36)
was really no benefit to like picking up (54:33 - 54:38)
items off the ground together but it was (54:36 - 54:40)
still like that immersion of us in the (54:38 - 54:44)
same world and I I'm shocked that the (54:40 - 54:48)
the co-op doesn't destroy this game even (54:44 - 54:50)
more so they they did something right (54:48 - 54:52)
there (54:50 - 54:56)
um and what I said uh last week what I (54:52 - 54:57)
played (54:56 - 54:59)
in New York (54:57 - 55:02)
for an hour ran super smooth I thought (54:59 - 55:04)
it looked better than Legends but now (55:02 - 55:05)
now that I'm seeing these side by side (55:04 - 55:07)
I'm like second guess I feel like the (55:05 - 55:09)
Pokemon company is gaslighting me into (55:07 - 55:11)
like did I actually play something that (55:09 - 55:14)
great in New York uh was it actually a (55:11 - 55:16)
different game (55:14 - 55:19)
um but yeah like (55:16 - 55:21)
I Hope they've I think everyone hopes (55:19 - 55:25)
they they fix this in some capacity I (55:21 - 55:29)
mean they sold 10 million copies uh so (55:25 - 55:29)
I would say like it's like bad PR is (55:29 - 55:34)
good PR like people posting all these (55:33 - 55:37)
glitches and stuff it's just I feel like (55:34 - 55:39)
yes it's getting more Buzz to the game (55:37 - 55:41)
but to your point Steve it's like now (55:39 - 55:44)
the question is like the the real (55:41 - 55:46)
question is do you recommend this game (55:44 - 55:48)
and you know and I I I'm at the same (55:46 - 55:51)
point where you are I go it's a fun game (55:48 - 55:52)
if you're a Pokemon fan you played every (55:51 - 55:56)
single Pokemon game and you know do you (55:52 - 55:57)
enjoy Pokemon for what it is and you can (55:56 - 56:00)
look past those issues I'm sure you'll (55:57 - 56:02)
find a nice thing in this game to enjoy (56:00 - 56:05)
but if you're someone because with this (56:02 - 56:06)
game but the whole way they have those (56:05 - 56:09)
three story lines split out is they're (56:06 - 56:12)
trying to say hey if you are new to the (56:09 - 56:16)
game we have you know this the the gym (56:12 - 56:18)
battle we have a or if you want the gym (56:16 - 56:20)
battle uh line because you like (56:18 - 56:21)
traditional games you do this or you (56:20 - 56:22)
want something different you can do (56:21 - 56:24)
Titans or you can do a team star route (56:22 - 56:27)
and I think if you're coming to this (56:24 - 56:30)
game not playing Pokemon in a while (56:27 - 56:32)
it's very difficult to recommend like I (56:30 - 56:36)
might just say again go play Arceus go (56:32 - 56:38)
play Let's Go I mean those are really (56:36 - 56:40)
soft honestly go play sword and shield (56:38 - 56:41)
also because those are solid games it's (56:40 - 56:44)
just something about this game (56:41 - 56:46)
an initial weekend (56:44 - 56:49)
it just felt unfinished and I and to (56:46 - 56:51)
your point I hope that you know someone (56:49 - 56:54)
is working on some patch before you know (56:51 - 56:56)
the end of the year before we even think (56:54 - 56:58)
about like Bev said before we even think (56:56 - 57:00)
about DLC take care of the problems (56:58 - 57:03)
first polish that up make us enjoy it (57:00 - 57:06)
and then give us the new icing on the (57:03 - 57:08)
cake later on in the next two to three (57:06 - 57:12)
year or more lifespan of the game (57:08 - 57:12)
I feel like I'm gonna play Devil's (57:12 - 57:16)
Advocate and say if you are burnt out (57:14 - 57:18)
from Pokemon games maybe this is the (57:16 - 57:20)
game to try because it's not your same (57:18 - 57:23)
formulaic thing that's that's a good (57:20 - 57:25)
point going on for 25 years (57:23 - 57:28)
so if like the the thing that you enjoy (57:25 - 57:30)
is the catching Pokemon and collecting (57:28 - 57:32)
them then this is it because you don't (57:30 - 57:33)
have to do the gym so you don't have to (57:32 - 57:37)
get stuck in in routes and not wanting (57:33 - 57:39)
to battle chainers and trying to figure (57:37 - 57:43)
out how to sneak past them uh so yeah (57:39 - 57:45)
maybe there's a little bit more (57:43 - 57:46)
flexibility with with how you want to (57:45 - 57:48)
play this game so maybe maybe that's (57:46 - 57:52)
what brings them back I don't know (57:48 - 57:52)
we did report on um that this game was (57:54 - 58:00)
was getting a lot of pre-orders like (57:58 - 58:02)
that it was it was reported that like we (58:00 - 58:03)
have more pre-orders for this game than (58:02 - 58:05)
we did for certain Shield (58:03 - 58:06)
um (58:05 - 58:09)
and I I'd be curious of like (58:06 - 58:11)
how many people picked up their (58:09 - 58:12)
pre-orders didn't really pay attention (58:11 - 58:15)
to anyone else playing or streaming or (58:12 - 58:18)
YouTube or anything and then you know (58:15 - 58:20)
came to their own conclusion of like (58:18 - 58:22)
oh this is not finished or this is (58:20 - 58:24)
unpolished or like I've never played a (58:22 - 58:26)
Pokemon game so buggy or ugly or or (58:24 - 58:28)
chunky (58:26 - 58:30)
um versus like (58:28 - 58:34)
now people it's been three days and if (58:30 - 58:36)
you haven't bought it it's been (58:34 - 58:38)
sorry it's been almost a week uh I'm (58:36 - 58:41)
losing track of time uh (58:38 - 58:43)
it's been almost a week (58:41 - 58:45)
and (58:43 - 58:47)
obviously the first three days sold 10 (58:45 - 58:49)
million copies now are people on the (58:47 - 58:51)
fence because of that (58:49 - 58:53)
um and I think (58:51 - 58:55)
we would see that going into Black (58:53 - 58:58)
Friday and going into Christmas of okay (58:55 - 59:00)
you sold 10 million copies really fast (58:58 - 59:02)
because you you did have a good PR cycle (59:00 - 59:05)
you did hype it up you did (59:02 - 59:07)
add what people want you know people (59:05 - 59:09)
wanted Co-op people wanted an open world (59:07 - 59:11)
people wanted to challenge gyms in a (59:09 - 59:13)
specific order people wanted a better (59:11 - 59:15)
story which to be fair I think they've (59:13 - 59:17)
delivered in the better story hands down (59:15 - 59:18)
I think it's a great story yeah great (59:17 - 59:19)
stories in this game apps like hands (59:18 - 59:21)
down one I think one of the best ones in (59:19 - 59:22)
a while (59:21 - 59:23)
um (59:22 - 59:25)
so they're giving people what they want (59:23 - 59:28)
and then in return we're not we're not (59:25 - 59:30)
getting the the quality (59:28 - 59:32)
of some would argue that the quality has (59:30 - 59:34)
been down for a while but (59:32 - 59:36)
um (59:34 - 59:40)
that that in itself is like enough to be (59:36 - 59:41)
like (59:40 - 59:44)
oh maybe I don't want this game uh I (59:41 - 59:47)
don't know if (59:44 - 59:48)
because game freak and the Pokemon (59:47 - 59:51)
company are a Nintendo are all Japanese (59:48 - 59:52)
companies (59:51 - 59:55)
I don't know if them saying something (59:52 - 59:59)
would help Maybe not maybe not so much (59:55 - 60:00)
sales (59:59 - 60:03)
I don't think it would help sales but I (60:00 - 60:06)
think it would put (60:03 - 60:09)
already purchased customers at a bit of (60:06 - 60:11)
ease if they're if they're like (60:09 - 60:12)
frustrated (60:11 - 60:14)
and they want to walk away (60:12 - 60:17)
uh or maybe not come back to it I'm not (60:14 - 60:18)
sure (60:17 - 60:21)
um but there even with the lumio city (60:18 - 60:23)
bug which if you don't remember when (60:21 - 60:26)
when X and Y came out there was a bug (60:23 - 60:29)
where if you saved in lumio City your (60:26 - 60:31)
game would just never boot back up again (60:29 - 60:32)
you'd be completely locked out (60:31 - 60:34)
everything was bricked you'd lose (60:32 - 60:35)
everything so you would either have to (60:34 - 60:37)
save outside of lumio city or inside a (60:35 - 60:39)
Pokemon Center in lumio city and you'd (60:37 - 60:42)
be fine and uh when Twitter was a (60:39 - 60:46)
delightful okay place that word spread (60:42 - 60:48)
on Twitter and people knew about it and (60:46 - 60:49)
obviously not everyone has Twitter but (60:48 - 60:51)
you know Facebook Instagram whatever (60:49 - 60:53)
other social medias existed when X and Y (60:51 - 60:54)
was out (60:53 - 60:57)
um at least in that case they could say (60:54 - 61:00)
hey don't save in the city (60:57 - 61:03)
uh and you're good until they fix it (61:00 - 61:06)
they did fix it it took about two weeks (61:03 - 61:07)
um it sucked for the people who you know (61:06 - 61:09)
didn't know that or didn't have social (61:07 - 61:10)
media to be able to check but they never (61:09 - 61:12)
said anything they just here's here's (61:10 - 61:14)
the fix (61:12 - 61:17)
in this situation this affects everyone (61:14 - 61:19)
there's there's no like I don't know (61:17 - 61:22)
like I would I went to uh one of the (61:19 - 61:25)
bigger cities and I got there and I (61:22 - 61:26)
opened my menu (61:25 - 61:28)
wasn't doing anything I just opened my (61:26 - 61:30)
menu to like check my Pokemon my game (61:28 - 61:32)
Crash like oh wow (61:30 - 61:35)
um and then another situation I wasn't (61:32 - 61:36)
actively playing the game for 10 minutes (61:35 - 61:38)
I had my controller down I was (61:36 - 61:40)
interacting with my twitch chat and then (61:38 - 61:42)
we were having some back and forth (61:40 - 61:45)
dialogue uh surprisingly about Twitter (61:42 - 61:46)
and then I went to pick up my controller (61:45 - 61:49)
and again went to open my menu my whole (61:46 - 61:51)
game crashed I'm running auto save so (61:49 - 61:54)
not that big of a deal but (61:51 - 61:56)
that can live a bad taste in somebody's (61:54 - 61:59)
mouth for sure of like and again there (61:56 - 62:00)
are there are tons of Pokemon fans (61:59 - 62:03)
enjoying this game they're loving it (62:00 - 62:06)
myself one of them I can see past that (62:03 - 62:09)
right it's funny because uh (62:06 - 62:11)
somebody was like oh I play The Sims I'm (62:09 - 62:13)
just used to the game being broken all (62:11 - 62:14)
the time and I was like oh I had no clue (62:13 - 62:16)
like I'm not in The Sims World I didn't (62:14 - 62:18)
know that Sims 4 is like constantly (62:16 - 62:20)
Broken But as soon as somebody mentioned (62:18 - 62:21)
that all these Sims fans can't have a (62:20 - 62:24)
nowhere they're like oh yeah is always (62:21 - 62:26)
broken and I was like oh geez I didn't (62:24 - 62:27)
know I thought the Sims was a pretty (62:26 - 62:29)
Rock Solid game and everyone's like are (62:27 - 62:31)
you out of your mind that game's broken (62:29 - 62:33)
every week (62:31 - 62:35)
um (62:33 - 62:38)
so yeah I I (62:35 - 62:41)
it'd be nice for game freaked or Pokemon (62:38 - 62:44)
or somebody be like hey these are the (62:41 - 62:45)
these are the five things we're about to (62:44 - 62:47)
work on expect to patch in a month I (62:45 - 62:49)
think that would go a huge way (62:47 - 62:53)
absolutely absolutely but they've never (62:49 - 62:55)
done that the only time I think the (62:53 - 62:57)
they've addressed it was like hey we (62:55 - 62:59)
heard you about the national decks suck (62:57 - 63:00)
it up (62:59 - 63:03)
do they do anything um during um I'm (63:00 - 63:05)
trying to remember this did they do (63:03 - 63:06)
anything during (63:05 - 63:08)
um uh bdsp like because I remember when (63:06 - 63:10)
that game first came out like there was (63:08 - 63:13)
a bunch of glitches with that game I (63:10 - 63:15)
don't remember any type of no they just (63:13 - 63:17)
they just silently patched it they did (63:15 - 63:20)
okay yeah because that was you could you (63:17 - 63:21)
could tell the patches just by (63:20 - 63:24)
speedrunners right like Speeders I could (63:21 - 63:25)
get the game done in 30 seconds and then (63:24 - 63:27)
oh they patched it so now it's five (63:25 - 63:29)
minutes ah they patched it again so now (63:27 - 63:30)
it takes like an hour (63:29 - 63:32)
um I do I do want to say one quick thing (63:30 - 63:34)
about Scarlet because I know like and (63:32 - 63:36)
everything that people are saying yes (63:34 - 63:39)
valid criticisms and we see it we it's (63:36 - 63:42)
documented on social media we've we've (63:39 - 63:43)
all here experienced it and everyone (63:42 - 63:45)
else listening probably has experienced (63:43 - 63:47)
something I know for me like for me the (63:45 - 63:49)
biggest thing I want them to fix if I (63:47 - 63:50)
choose one thing it's just the menu (63:49 - 63:53)
system like even just boxes like just (63:50 - 63:55)
being able to like open up your box and (63:53 - 63:57)
like navigate through your Pokemon and (63:55 - 64:00)
for people who do even like competitive (63:57 - 64:03)
or you know shiny uh hunting or breeding (64:00 - 64:06)
and like those icons just load really (64:03 - 64:08)
slow and even that took me by surprise (64:06 - 64:10)
and on a game that I'm not even thinking (64:08 - 64:12)
about you know 3D rendering models (64:10 - 64:14)
walking in a city (64:12 - 64:16)
um not you know you know walking around (64:14 - 64:17)
like you know four FPS but like in a (64:16 - 64:20)
menu system when you have an icon just (64:17 - 64:22)
popping up in the squares (64:20 - 64:25)
it takes a long time to do (64:22 - 64:26)
um to me that's you know that's that's (64:25 - 64:28)
the big thing I want to see fixed but (64:26 - 64:30)
aside from that I think (64:28 - 64:33)
this game has you know it it's gorgeous (64:30 - 64:35)
when it shines I think it has to see if (64:33 - 64:38)
you mentioned fantastic music I did not (64:35 - 64:39)
know this way like you go in different (64:38 - 64:42)
areas of the map the music changes but (64:39 - 64:44)
also the battle music changes that a lot (64:42 - 64:45)
of Pokemon games get the same battle (64:44 - 64:48)
music over and over and over again but (64:45 - 64:50)
in this game depending on where you are (64:48 - 64:52)
in like in the uh in the region that (64:50 - 64:54)
battle music changes and I just loved (64:52 - 64:57)
the little touches like that and you (64:54 - 64:59)
know the stories are great (64:57 - 65:01)
um I think the Pokemon models are uh did (64:59 - 65:03)
some really fun ones out there (65:01 - 65:05)
um and some and uh so I think there's a (65:03 - 65:08)
lot of good going for it but again to (65:05 - 65:08)
your point (65:08 - 65:11)
I just wish someone just comes out and (65:08 - 65:14)
says and I'll wrap up with this uh I'm (65:11 - 65:16)
also a digimon fan and I waited almost (65:14 - 65:18)
three years for a Digimon game to come (65:16 - 65:20)
out on the switch (65:18 - 65:22)
the one thing that at least that company (65:20 - 65:25)
did also was they gave updates on (65:22 - 65:27)
Twitter to the community and say hey the (65:25 - 65:28)
game is delayed because of this or hey (65:27 - 65:30)
we're working on this (65:28 - 65:33)
a simple post like that on Twitter or on (65:30 - 65:35)
the site uh I think will go a long way (65:33 - 65:39)
just to ease people's concerns with um (65:35 - 65:42)
with these new uh Generations (65:39 - 65:44)
yeah because there's there's definitely (65:42 - 65:47)
fear that like the question is are we (65:44 - 65:49)
even gonna get like you know patches or (65:47 - 65:51)
fixes and I think I think the answer is (65:49 - 65:53)
is yes but just the fact that people are (65:51 - 65:55)
asking that question you know like just (65:53 - 65:58)
having just coming out and saying we (65:55 - 66:00)
know that these things exist we're (65:58 - 66:01)
working on it like even if they don't (66:00 - 66:03)
put a date on it like that alone would (66:01 - 66:06)
just go miles I feel like I would of (66:03 - 66:08)
course like to have you know a projected (66:06 - 66:10)
date but it's not going to change (66:08 - 66:11)
anything I'm still going to play (66:10 - 66:14)
yeah it's it's it's tough because again (66:11 - 66:17)
I do think they made something special (66:14 - 66:20)
um and I I think there is something (66:17 - 66:23)
there and I don't (66:20 - 66:25)
I I I've never thought that game freak (66:23 - 66:27)
is a world-class amazing developer I (66:25 - 66:30)
mean look at you you can point to any (66:27 - 66:32)
Pokemon game and be like man that was (66:30 - 66:35)
broken in this specific way uh it's (66:32 - 66:38)
funny too I to end with the to end with (66:35 - 66:39)
this whole conversation because we could (66:38 - 66:41)
keep talking about all the issues and (66:39 - 66:42)
stuff (66:41 - 66:43)
um (66:42 - 66:46)
I saw a tweet of somebody saying you (66:43 - 66:48)
guys are so upset about how broken (66:46 - 66:51)
scarlet and violet are but you guys were (66:48 - 66:53)
so happy of how broken red and blue was (66:51 - 66:55)
and y'all are forgetting about missing (66:53 - 66:57)
no which is true (66:55 - 67:00)
literally I I cannot think of a single (66:57 - 67:04)
kid and Brian blue came out when I was (67:00 - 67:06)
like 10 or 11. I can't think of a single (67:04 - 67:09)
kid who wasn't like Juju the missing no (67:06 - 67:11)
glitch you can go up and down it (67:09 - 67:14)
destroys your game your menu system is (67:11 - 67:17)
broken you have thousands of master (67:14 - 67:21)
balls but like your PC is out of control (67:17 - 67:23)
um at a certain point yeah it was just (67:21 - 67:25)
it just brought me back of um you ain't (67:23 - 67:27)
living man without the missing though (67:25 - 67:28)
you're not living without missing no but (67:27 - 67:30)
it just kind of it's just funny of how (67:28 - 67:33)
broken all of all of these games have (67:30 - 67:35)
been throughout the years you know like (67:33 - 67:37)
none of the apricorn balls worked in in (67:35 - 67:41)
the Johto region when that game came out (67:37 - 67:43)
um in Diamond and Pearl (67:41 - 67:46)
every like saving and all anything (67:43 - 67:48)
revolving around save data was (67:46 - 67:52)
incredibly slow and sluggish (67:48 - 67:53)
and I want to have faith in Game Freak (67:52 - 67:55)
because you look at something that is as (67:53 - 67:58)
bad as Diamond and Pearl (67:55 - 68:00)
uh technically I know I'm not talking (67:58 - 68:01)
like people love Sinnoh in the Pokemon (68:00 - 68:02)
I'm not talking about that I'm (68:01 - 68:04)
technically Diamond and Pearl are (68:02 - 68:07)
terrible and you look at platinum and (68:04 - 68:10)
they did it they like they they fixed (68:07 - 68:13)
everything technical about that well not (68:10 - 68:14)
everything but most things like game (68:13 - 68:16)
runs faster game runs smoother saving is (68:14 - 68:18)
better they added this feature uh like (68:16 - 68:20)
the even like adding a little back (68:18 - 68:23)
button to the the Pokey gear of like oh (68:20 - 68:26)
I can go backwards now cool like (68:23 - 68:29)
they did it so hopefully I look at like (68:26 - 68:31)
okay well you went from you learned your (68:29 - 68:34)
mistakes in in in in time in Pearl and (68:31 - 68:36)
and you made platinum and platinum is (68:34 - 68:38)
the definite version I don't want to (68:36 - 68:41)
wait that long though I spent the sixty (68:38 - 68:44)
dollars uh 10 million other people spent (68:41 - 68:46)
sixty dollars I don't want to wait till (68:44 - 68:48)
Platinum I don't want to wait till DLC (68:46 - 68:51)
