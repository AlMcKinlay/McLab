debatable (1:47 - 1:49)
uh we have some pokemon news for you all (1:50 - 1:55)
this week a lot of things that should (1:52 - 1:58)
have been maybe announced months ago got (1:55 - 2:00)
announced this week so hey we're (1:58 - 2:02)
moving right along (2:00 - 2:03)
uh before i forget because it's not on (2:02 - 2:06)
my news doc yet but i did have that (2:03 - 2:10)
tweet open is that if you spend (2:06 - 2:12)
all right play the news music we're (2:10 - 2:13)
getting into things (2:12 - 2:14)
you're killing yourself to play the news (2:13 - 2:19)
music if you spend 15 at gamestop oh boy (2:14 - 2:21)
on pokemon related collectibles you will (2:19 - 2:23)
get a (2:21 - 2:27)
doralodon tcg card with the gamestop (2:23 - 2:30)
logo embossed on it now (2:27 - 2:33)
very important another possible card you (2:30 - 2:34)
could put next to your ancient mew in (2:33 - 2:37)
the closet we don't know (2:34 - 2:39)
you know how much this (2:37 - 2:42)
gamestop stamped doralod is going to be (2:39 - 2:44)
worth in the future but (2:42 - 2:47)
does it have a pikachu on it no just (2:44 - 2:49)
does it have a chair is there on it (2:47 - 2:52)
nope no no it does not we know what it's (2:49 - 2:56)
worth then two zeros correct greg (2:52 - 2:58)
oh i was uh (2:56 - 3:00)
sometimes on our twitch streams we uh we (2:58 - 3:02)
we go to ebay (3:00 - 3:03)
yeah r (3:02 - 3:05)
or (3:03 - 3:05)
the collective (3:17 - 3:21)
listener fan base oh that's what (3:19 - 3:24)
contributes to the problem i like this (3:21 - 3:27)
sports team thing it's still yours (3:24 - 3:29)
you are still benefiting from it we have (3:27 - 3:32)
yet to be invited (3:29 - 3:34)
well uh last time i checked you guys (3:32 - 3:35)
were in minnesota (3:34 - 3:36)
uh (3:35 - 3:38)
last time i checked (3:36 - 3:40)
uh that is correct because we chose (3:38 - 3:43)
correctly with our life choices (3:40 - 3:45)
you know if i could be chosen to not go (3:43 - 3:48)
to mps and have the parents i have uh (3:45 - 3:48)
you know (3:48 - 3:50)
and would have made those choices okay (3:48 - 3:51)
so (3:50 - 3:53)
sometimes we (3:51 - 3:54)
look at ebay (3:53 - 3:55)
and we (3:54 - 3:58)
we found this auction that was they were (3:55 - 4:00)
selling it looked like a mom (3:58 - 4:03)
selling her son's pokemon collection oh (4:00 - 4:06)
he went to college and i'm gonna say (4:03 - 4:08)
they wanted two thousand seven hundred (4:06 - 4:11)
dollars for everything on the table (4:08 - 4:14)
and it was not worth two thousand seven (4:11 - 4:16)
hundred dollars but (4:14 - 4:18)
hey are you including the memories in (4:16 - 4:19)
there (4:18 - 4:21)
that she's selling because i think (4:19 - 4:22)
that's probably worth two thousand (4:21 - 4:23)
dollars (4:22 - 4:25)
but it reminded me that there was a (4:23 - 4:27)
bunch of cards that came out at toys r (4:25 - 4:31)
us with the toys r us logo on them (4:27 - 4:33)
and i don't have those cards and i'm a (4:31 - 4:35)
sucker for (4:33 - 4:37)
promotional (4:35 - 4:38)
stuff (4:37 - 4:41)
you can just leave the promotional stuff (4:38 - 4:43)
off you're just a sucker (4:41 - 4:45)
do you mean during the 20th anniversary (4:43 - 4:46)
when they had that cross promotion with (4:45 - 4:48)
toys r us and you could just go in and (4:46 - 4:50)
get tcg cards except they were always (4:48 - 4:52)
out of them remember when toys r us was (4:50 - 4:55)
a thing was toys r us open during five (4:52 - 4:58)
years ago yes yeah (4:55 - 5:00)
it must have been like shortly after (4:58 - 5:02)
that they closed (5:00 - 5:03)
yes (5:02 - 5:05)
2017 (5:03 - 5:07)
uh anyways i looked up those cards (5:05 - 5:08)
separately and they're like ten dollars (5:07 - 5:10)
a piece so they're not uh (5:08 - 5:14)
june 29th 2018 oh 28 permanently closed (5:10 - 5:16)
uh so that it wasn't like they were (5:14 - 5:18)
specifically they they didn't raise in (5:16 - 5:19)
value (5:18 - 5:23)
like we make (5:19 - 5:23)
lay out the truth here i mean we we talk (5:24 - 5:30)
about how much the hmu is worth but it (5:26 - 5:31)
it it (5:30 - 5:33)
it ain't worth a lot either (5:31 - 5:36)
now those burger king gold coins oh yeah (5:33 - 5:37)
well they're made out of solid gold (5:36 - 5:39)
that's yeah that's right that's an (5:37 - 5:41)
investment for the future when we run (5:39 - 5:42)
out of things that (5:41 - 5:44)
that need gold we can sell those in for (5:42 - 5:46)
billions (5:44 - 5:48)
everyone's talking that bitcoin but i'm (5:46 - 5:51)
talking that poly world gold coin (5:48 - 5:53)
that's the (5:51 - 5:54)
that's another (5:53 - 5:58)
currency an ancient new cryptocurrency (5:54 - 6:01)
i think there is somebody who started a (5:58 - 6:04)
pokemon cryptocurrency (6:01 - 6:06)
uh we can't um (6:04 - 6:08)
i don't think it i i don't think it (6:06 - 6:10)
lasted (6:08 - 6:12)
probably honestly for the best (6:10 - 6:14)
honestly for the best (6:12 - 6:16)
uh (6:14 - 6:17)
okay (6:16 - 6:19)
some more news here we actually got some (6:17 - 6:21)

again here (6:34 - 6:37)
bad theme song i heard (6:35 - 6:40)
oh i haven't heard it yet (6:37 - 6:41)
how do we know it's a bad theme song who (6:40 - 6:44)
said i've i've heard from various people (6:41 - 6:49)
on uh discord and twitch and uh (6:44 - 6:49)
i don't think anything greg and i are (6:52 - 6:59)
the arbiters of good music (6:54 - 6:59)
the journey's theme song was a banger i (6:59 - 7:05)
mean yes it was good and this is the (7:02 - 7:07)
master journey yeah (7:05 - 7:09)
now i have to look it up (7:07 - 7:11)
all right master (7:09 - 7:14)
journey (7:11 - 7:16)
pokemon (7:14 - 7:17)
theme (7:16 - 7:19)
song (7:17 - 7:19)
take me on a journey well i wonder if (7:24 - 7:31)
this is the japanese one (7:26 - 7:31)
journey to your heart i can tell you in (7:33 - 7:39)
the first three seconds it is worse (7:35 - 7:39)
pokemon master journey's full opening (7:42 - 7:47)
theme song (7:44 - 7:47)
oh yeah there it is (7:47 - 7:54)
40 seconds i have a 40 second space (7:50 - 7:54)
oh i am into this (7:56 - 8:00)
it was bad it's it's not good (8:07 - 8:12)
oh good lyrics (8:16 - 8:20)
that kick me in a journey to your heart (8:18 - 8:24)
that is a bop i am into it jay popped me (8:20 - 8:25)
up friends (8:24 - 8:26)
yeah (8:25 - 8:29)
i've been here with my glowy sticks (8:26 - 8:32)
doing the hand motions heck yeah (8:29 - 8:34)
you here's the thing (8:32 - 8:37)
it is not as good as journey stars today (8:34 - 8:39)
journey starts today was very very good (8:37 - 8:41)
this is good the best themes possibly (8:39 - 8:44)
top three it's probably the best theme (8:41 - 8:47)
but i had to listen to the horrible (8:44 - 8:49)
sinnoh wrap (8:47 - 8:53)
when i was re-watching and compared to (8:49 - 8:54)
that (8:53 - 8:57)
this is a masterpiece this is one of the (8:54 - 8:59)
best songs they've done compared to the (8:57 - 9:01)
sinnoh rap (8:59 - 9:02)
oh boy (9:01 - 9:04)
that song (9:02 - 9:07)
is bad i had two i think they're two (9:04 - 9:10)
wraps (9:07 - 9:10)
it was bad (9:11 - 9:14)
i think it i think it was obvious that (9:14 - 9:19)
if they changed the theme nothing was (9:17 - 9:21)
going to pass (9:19 - 9:23)
nothing was going to surpass (9:21 - 9:26)
the journeys theme no journey's harsh (9:23 - 9:28)
today is an outstanding song (9:26 - 9:30)
this is good (9:28 - 9:31)
it's just you know it's not up to that (9:30 - 9:33)
level but i urge you people if you do (9:31 - 9:34)
not like the song (9:33 - 9:38)
go listen to the sinnoh wrap (9:34 - 9:39)
opening (9:38 - 9:42)
and then revisit this with newly (9:39 - 9:45)
awakened eyes (9:42 - 9:45)
uh what what did they say here (9:49 - 9:53)

animated storytelling with the first (12:15 - 12:19)
episode of evolutions titled the (12:16 - 12:22)
champion episode 1 offers fans a fresh (12:19 - 12:23)
perspective on what goes in the heart of (12:22 - 12:26)
a pokemon champion as leon prepares to (12:23 - 12:28)
face the greatest challenge of all what (12:26 - 12:29)
goes through his mind doubt regret (12:28 - 12:31)
determination we it literally just (12:29 - 12:33)
spoiled the whole episode right there (12:31 - 12:36)
watch the champion to find out (12:33 - 12:36)
there's there's elements (12:36 - 12:42)
of things that you already saw if you (12:39 - 12:46)
played the game and watch the anime (12:42 - 12:48)
keep an eye out for new episodes which (12:46 - 12:50)
are releasing every two weeks bringing a (12:48 - 12:51)
viewer (12:50 - 12:53)
on a journey of spanning the vast (12:51 - 12:56)
wonderful pokemon world (12:53 - 12:58)
of pokemon (12:56 - 13:00)
so in preparation for this you'll all be (12:58 - 13:03)
amazed i re-watched the entirety of the (13:00 - 13:05)
forgotten (13:03 - 13:07)
by you guys twilight wings (13:05 - 13:11)
which uh is in a very similar style of (13:07 - 13:14)
anime and also covers uh a (13:11 - 13:18)
leon's journey in some way (13:14 - 13:20)
what do you mean forgotten i mean last (13:18 - 13:22)
week we haven't seen an anime like this (13:20 - 13:25)
since pokemon generations and i'm like (13:22 - 13:27)
twilight wings was just last year and it (13:25 - 13:29)
was kind of the same concept (13:27 - 13:31)
it was the same concept but like not the (13:29 - 13:33)
anime style (13:31 - 13:35)
no it's a very similar style (13:33 - 13:37)
yeah watch it watch it again it's a very (13:35 - 13:39)
similar style when i thought this one (13:37 - 13:43)
was like this one i like they turned up (13:39 - 13:45)
the anime jojo bazaar's adventures (13:43 - 13:46)
button to like (13:45 - 13:50)
17. i i did a (13:46 - 13:51)
reaction video to this on youtube if you (13:50 - 13:54)
want to see my reaction in real time to (13:51 - 13:57)
this episode but i don't (13:54 - 13:59)
like the way leon looks (13:57 - 14:01)
in in this (13:59 - 14:05)
episode sad you don't like manly (14:01 - 14:05)
like (14:05 - 14:07)
chiseled (14:05 - 14:09)
yeah he's more angular (14:07 - 14:12)
in the lines artistic choices were made (14:09 - 14:13)
yeah yes (14:12 - 14:16)
it's very jojo's bizarre adventure but (14:13 - 14:20)
it's very anime the real issue (14:16 - 14:22)
which will probably never be answered (14:20 - 14:24)
for me (14:22 - 14:25)
is (14:24 - 14:29)
we all know where galar is (14:25 - 14:32)
why do all these people not have british (14:29 - 14:35)
accents it's like wait wait wait we just (14:32 - 14:37)
don't have british people in this world (14:35 - 14:41)
that was translated for (14:37 - 14:41)
well i don't play that game (14:41 - 14:47)
watch cartoons they have british accents (14:45 - 14:49)
if you watch the uk version and why does (14:47 - 14:52)
hop sound like he's about 27 years old (14:49 - 14:55)
because he's had that pack a day habit (14:52 - 14:57)
in both twilight wings and this one he (14:55 - 14:59)
just sounds like a like (14:57 - 15:02)
approaching middle age (14:59 - 15:04)
uh yeah well you're right they did do (15:02 - 15:06)
twilight wings when i was thinking of (15:04 - 15:08)
evolutions i was thinking of generations (15:06 - 15:10)
where it was like (15:08 - 15:13)
we need to hit every region (15:10 - 15:14)
and (15:13 - 15:18)
tell a story i guess (15:14 - 15:18)
i feel for like okay so i liked it (15:19 - 15:22)
spoiler (15:21 - 15:24)
but also (15:22 - 15:26)
for 10 minutes i feel like nothing (15:24 - 15:27)
happened (15:26 - 15:29)
charizard gave him a hug (15:27 - 15:31)
yeah it was 10 minutes of getting to a (15:29 - 15:33)
good hug (15:31 - 15:33)
um i sort of agree that (15:34 - 15:41)
nothing new happened like (15:38 - 15:44)
things happened (15:41 - 15:46)
and it felt (15:44 - 15:48)
a little weird i'm like why are we (15:46 - 15:50)
watching this again i think this is the (15:48 - 15:53)
third time in anime form (15:50 - 15:57)
we have seen this scene (15:53 - 15:57)
i guess we've not we haven't seen the (15:57 - 16:00)
scene of like leon backstage before the (15:58 - 16:03)
match that's the new part um true (16:00 - 16:06)
i mean (16:03 - 16:06)
and i sort of feel like it says that (16:07 - 16:11)
the thing that i didn't like about it is (16:12 - 16:17)
it sort of implied that he went into (16:15 - 16:20)
your big match (16:17 - 16:23)
completely distracted i know take it (16:20 - 16:26)
away from my hand will you downtrodden (16:23 - 16:28)
and i did not like adding that aspect to (16:26 - 16:29)
my win (16:28 - 16:30)
like (16:29 - 16:33)
oh i'm not getting leon at his best i'm (16:30 - 16:36)
getting leon who is broken doubting (16:33 - 16:40)
himself and doubting himself (16:36 - 16:40)
i did not care for that spin (16:40 - 16:46)
pre-added eternity (16:43 - 16:48)
leon did not need any charizard hugs to (16:46 - 16:52)
get out there and perform (16:48 - 16:52)
i i i did see somebody say on the (16:52 - 16:56)
comment actually the comments on that (16:55 - 16:58)
youtube video to everyone who commented (16:56 - 17:00)
on the youtube video super super nice (16:58 - 17:02)
and a really good discussion which is (17:00 - 17:05)
amazing for a youtube video (17:02 - 17:06)
um (17:05 - 17:06)
but (17:06 - 17:08)
somebody brought up (17:06 - 17:09)
that throughout the game leon talks (17:08 - 17:11)
about how he needs to protect gallery (17:09 - 17:14)
and that's what a champion does and so (17:11 - 17:15)
when he's laying there and he sees that (17:14 - 17:17)
you're doing (17:15 - 17:20)
it and not him (17:17 - 17:23)
he's like come to accept that (17:20 - 17:24)
he doesn't have to like but he doesn't (17:23 - 17:26)
accept it he's like (17:24 - 17:29)
he's sad about it he's like i couldn't (17:26 - 17:30)
deal with the one yeah i'm supposed to (17:29 - 17:33)
do what what meaning has my life any (17:30 - 17:35)
longer what i don't like is i feel like (17:33 - 17:38)
it showed him giving up before your (17:35 - 17:39)
battle (17:38 - 17:42)
like he was going out onto the field (17:39 - 17:45)
fully aware that no here's where i lose (17:42 - 17:46)
because i couldn't do this yeah i (17:45 - 17:48)
already know will's better than me so (17:46 - 17:50)
why i mean if half half the people who (17:48 - 17:52)
playing the video game were using (17:50 - 17:54)
eternitis that they just caught of (17:52 - 17:56)
course you're gonna lose (17:54 - 17:57)
he just watched you catch a legendary (17:56 - 17:59)
pokemon that you're gonna he the game (17:57 - 18:00)
does i don't know if we talked about (17:59 - 18:02)
this the game does (18:00 - 18:04)
acknowledge like leon will say something (18:02 - 18:06)
if you throw out eternitis oh really (18:04 - 18:08)
yeah (18:06 - 18:09)
so if you're in that final battle in the (18:08 - 18:11)
game and you throw out eternitis he'll (18:09 - 18:13)
actually say like oh of course you (18:11 - 18:16)
brought what's it like to cheat cheater (18:13 - 18:19)
i was just like hi dangerous pokemon go (18:16 - 18:20)
in box now (18:19 - 18:22)
uh yeah no i i box it too but yeah he (18:20 - 18:24)
does he does say something if you bring (18:22 - 18:25)
out alternatives which is like a really (18:24 - 18:27)
nice touch (18:25 - 18:29)
um (18:27 - 18:32)
we need the we need now in like two (18:29 - 18:35)
years we need the episode (18:32 - 18:35)
of the this episode (18:35 - 18:41)
of whether he did purposely want to (18:38 - 18:46)
lose give it up yeah i i feel like (18:41 - 18:48)
that i did not like the fact that i felt (18:46 - 18:50)
like they (18:48 - 18:53)
heavily implied that he was he was he (18:50 - 18:56)
knew he was walking out to (18:53 - 18:57)
not win (18:56 - 18:59)
after winning the entire time (18:57 - 19:03)
i i didn't i didn't care for that like i (18:59 - 19:05)
get being downtrodden and then like (19:03 - 19:07)
being needed to be cheered up (19:05 - 19:10)
for like a half a second but like the (19:07 - 19:12)
entire episode was him (19:10 - 19:14)
being sad and then he (19:12 - 19:16)
barely perks up when charizard's like (19:14 - 19:18)
let's hug it out (19:16 - 19:19)
yeah it's just (19:18 - 19:20)
i like the episode i thought it was (19:19 - 19:23)
beautifully done i just felt like that (19:20 - 19:26)
through line sort of (19:23 - 19:27)
tainted (19:26 - 19:31)
the the experience i had with the games (19:27 - 19:31)
i don't think it didn't it didn't ruin (19:36 - 19:39)
it for me i just (19:38 - 19:41)
i just don't like the way he looks it's (19:39 - 19:42)
just very (19:41 - 19:44)
manly (19:42 - 19:45)
chiseled (19:44 - 19:47)
no it's not even super dude (19:45 - 19:49)
if i'm like (19:47 - 19:51)
window shopping animes (19:49 - 19:52)

the zeroed voice (33:30 - 33:35)
but i i i just i saw the roots swinging (33:32 - 33:37)
i'm like yep that's a rude and then all (33:35 - 33:38)
of a sudden he opened his mouth and i (33:37 - 33:40)
was like (33:38 - 33:42)
he's talking (33:40 - 33:42)
sometimes pokemon talk in these things a (33:43 - 33:48)
lot of times pokemon talk and these (33:46 - 33:50)
things i think every pokemon that has (33:48 - 33:54)
been featured has talked to these things (33:50 - 33:54)
i am (33:54 - 33:57)
i did the thing where i also read (33:58 - 34:03)
the twitter thread (34:01 - 34:04)
of this tweet (34:03 - 34:06)
and it was all these people tweeting (34:04 - 34:10)
that the power of us was good oh no we (34:06 - 34:11)
cannot (34:10 - 34:12)
and i was like (34:11 - 34:14)
i was like i'd rather deal with a (34:12 - 34:16)
national dexter right now than you deal (34:14 - 34:18)
with somebody who thinks the power of us (34:16 - 34:22)
was a decent movie (34:18 - 34:22)
look the power of us has great animation (34:22 - 34:28)
it looks beautiful (34:25 - 34:28)
that story is worse than a curious (34:28 - 34:33)
george book hey curious charge books (34:30 - 34:35)
aren't bad they're very good (34:33 - 34:37)
and yes it's like you're the man in the (34:35 - 34:38)
yellow hat (34:37 - 34:41)
[Laughter] (34:38 - 34:44)
where i should get a yellow hat (34:41 - 34:46)
uh (34:44 - 34:48)
yeah i mean like i can't help but think (34:46 - 34:50)
this is just like a tarzan clone but (34:48 - 34:53)
i mean it is (34:50 - 34:56)
i mean it is clearly a tarzan clone yes (34:53 - 34:58)
like (34:56 - 35:01)
it's it's that in the center this is are (34:58 - 35:04)
rude is raising (35:01 - 35:05)
hey what's up we are sort of ignoring (35:04 - 35:07)
that they already did this plotline with (35:05 - 35:10)
the kangaskhan kid (35:07 - 35:12)
yeah gosh that was such a good episode (35:10 - 35:14)
his name was tommy by the way (35:12 - 35:15)
because the dad dropped him out of the (35:14 - 35:17)
helicopter (35:15 - 35:18)
yes (35:17 - 35:20)
okay (35:18 - 35:22)
we've already been here this is just an (35:20 - 35:25)
ex a further exploration of (35:22 - 35:26)
the (35:25 - 35:28)
tarzan phenomenon (35:26 - 35:31)
with zarud this time which happens more (35:28 - 35:34)
frequently than people would expect (35:31 - 35:36)
parents losing their child children in (35:34 - 35:38)
the jungle and their children (35:36 - 35:41)
the apes are going to start a union soon (35:38 - 35:43)
complaining about all the daycare that (35:41 - 35:45)
they have to provide (35:43 - 35:49)
[Laughter] (35:45 - 35:49)
so (35:52 - 35:54)
they did an event in pokemon go for (35:54 - 36:01)
cello for secrets of the jungle (35:58 - 36:03)
that was on (36:01 - 36:06)
december 3rd 2020 (36:03 - 36:09)
which was jesse and james and shiny (36:06 - 36:10)
celebi (36:09 - 36:12)
if we remember this true i do remember (36:10 - 36:13)
um (36:12 - 36:15)
easy way that was like (36:13 - 36:18)
no money no early access no tickets (36:15 - 36:19)
everyone got shiny celebi pretty much (36:18 - 36:22)
for free the story line was pretty easy (36:19 - 36:24)
i think you had to do like three or four (36:22 - 36:25)
team rocket and then you had to battle (36:24 - 36:28)
jesse and james and (36:25 - 36:30)
there you go (36:28 - 36:33)
they did tweet there's no official blog (36:30 - 36:35)
post about this yet but the official (36:33 - 36:36)
pokemon go (36:35 - 36:39)
twitter uh twitter account to tweet get (36:36 - 36:40)
ready trainers a special event (36:39 - 36:42)
celebrating the global release of (36:40 - 36:44)
pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle (36:42 - 36:47)
is coming soon keep your eyes peeled (36:44 - 36:50)
which cool (36:47 - 36:51)
that makes sense (36:50 - 36:54)
uh they don't say what this event will (36:51 - 36:56)
be (36:54 - 36:59)
but pokemongohub.net (36:56 - 37:01)
points out a bunch of pokemon featured (36:59 - 37:03)
in the trailer (37:01 - 37:05)
um so they're saying that it could be (37:03 - 37:07)
any of these pokemon so they got pikachu (37:05 - 37:09)
flag on flapple (37:07 - 37:11)
flapple not in the game (37:09 - 37:14)
uh munchlax nuzleaf drillburn whooper (37:11 - 37:18)
blossom pangoro crustal squivet (37:14 - 37:19)
hoot hoot we do (37:18 - 37:21)
it (37:19 - 37:23)
let's love it (37:21 - 37:25)
uh well i mean maybe they're wrong maybe (37:23 - 37:26)
it was agreed (37:25 - 37:29)
uh ninjask petal stunky wobble fat (37:26 - 37:32)
haircross cherubi butterfree vileplume (37:29 - 37:37)
roserade combi and cramerant (37:32 - 37:37)
this this is this is the moment right (37:37 - 37:42)
we're all thinking the same thing (37:40 - 37:44)
no they're usually wrong about that what (37:42 - 37:47)
do you think i'm thinking (37:44 - 37:47)
this is when kramer ant comes to pokemon (37:47 - 37:52)
go nope oh (37:50 - 37:53)
no yeah no they'll (37:52 - 37:55)
[Laughter] (37:53 - 37:57)
it'll be up in there i mean they'll get (37:55 - 37:59)
to it eventually (37:57 - 38:01)
yeah um the only thing i the only thing (37:59 - 38:03)
that might be weird about them (38:01 - 38:05)
maybe not doing kramer does that feel (38:03 - 38:06)
like they would have to also do ericudo (38:05 - 38:08)
at the same time (38:06 - 38:10)
why (38:08 - 38:10)
what do jessie and james have an arakuda (38:11 - 38:15)
no they have a cramer kramer is very (38:14 - 38:18)
featured in this movie yeah because (38:15 - 38:21)
jesse and james have a cramer ant yeah (38:18 - 38:24)
therefore kramer ant is valid (38:21 - 38:26)
there has to be at least one point in (38:24 - 38:29)
the movie ericudo is shown why (38:26 - 38:31)
because it's just ability it just (38:29 - 38:34)
munches pikachu the entire time yeah no (38:31 - 38:36)
exactly so it's like the entire movie (38:34 - 38:39)
he's less than 50 percent hp yeah yes (38:36 - 38:42)
he's yes it's it's only crammer (38:39 - 38:44)
jessie and james violence of course it's (38:42 - 38:47)
less than 50 percent hp you know why (38:44 - 38:47)
well (38:47 - 38:49)
kramer could put a lot of things in its (38:47 - 38:52)
mouth that's not just one fish in the (38:49 - 38:56)
entire universe (38:52 - 38:56)
camera does put a lot of things in its (38:56 - 39:00)
mouth i think this is i think this is it (38:57 - 39:02)
i think kramer ants come into pokemon go (39:00 - 39:05)
i mean you're wishful thinking they have (39:02 - 39:08)
hoopa they're they're (39:05 - 39:08)
they need no more excuses i don't (39:08 - 39:13)

rosella was shining for everyone or (43:39 - 43:43)
could increase (43:40 - 43:43)
the problem with community not the (43:47 - 43:51)
problem (43:49 - 43:53)
maybe x maybe expectations are the (43:51 - 43:56)
problem people i feel like people want (43:53 - 43:59)
starters or people want (43:56 - 44:03)
like gable level pokemon (43:59 - 44:04)
but (44:03 - 44:08)
we're like halfway through the pokedex (44:04 - 44:09)
like (44:08 - 44:11)
like yes there are still more pokemon (44:09 - 44:12)
coming up (44:11 - 44:15)
like we can still do chespin fennekin (44:12 - 44:19)
uh the other one frookie that's three (44:15 - 44:24)
and then so we have nine starters left (44:19 - 44:25)
right (44:24 - 44:27)
yeah gen six gen seven gen eight so (44:25 - 44:30)
that's not even a year of communion days (44:27 - 44:32)
and then just assuming that each of (44:30 - 44:35)
those games have two pseudo legendaries (44:32 - 44:37)
that's six (44:35 - 44:39)
so we're at (44:37 - 44:42)
15 (44:39 - 44:42)
pokemon that's that's not even two years (44:42 - 44:47)
of content (44:45 - 44:49)
so yeah i totally i get it just goes (44:47 - 44:51)
like a like i like duskill as a pokemon (44:49 - 44:53)
so that's why i'm excited like i i like (44:51 - 44:55)
that evolutionary line (44:53 - 44:59)
it's really good for people who um (44:55 - 45:01)
play competitive for vgc i mean that's a (44:59 - 45:04)
very small market but like dusklops is (45:01 - 45:06)
one of the best vgc pokemon (45:04 - 45:08)
um so if you wanted just a shiny dust (45:06 - 45:12)
collapse it's like very good for that (45:08 - 45:12)
but (45:12 - 45:15)
if you think about it in the sense of (45:13 - 45:16)
like (45:15 - 45:18)
okay we have maybe (45:16 - 45:19)
let's be generous we have we have 12 (45:18 - 45:22)
pseudo legendaries left and we have nine (45:19 - 45:24)
starters left (45:22 - 45:24)
what's filling in that gap (45:25 - 45:29)
dust skulls (45:27 - 45:31)
but like you have to have other pokemon (45:29 - 45:33)
like fill it in like you could be like (45:31 - 45:35)
well okay it's feel (45:33 - 45:36)
okay (45:35 - 45:40)
this feel is not good competitively (45:36 - 45:41)
i don't think they could give it any (45:40 - 45:43)
sense of competitive move to make it (45:41 - 45:44)
good (45:43 - 45:46)
it'll be a new (45:44 - 45:48)
was tossed in there (45:46 - 45:50)
yeah but piloswine was super good for (45:48 - 45:52)
like it is the best ice type attacker (45:50 - 45:54)
for raids like it is it is super (45:52 - 45:56)
dominant (45:54 - 45:58)
i think the real issue is that they've (45:56 - 45:59)
seen that people aren't spending money (45:58 - 46:02)
on community days but now that they've (45:59 - 46:04)
done like we're doing monthly community (46:02 - 46:05)
days people expect there to be a (46:04 - 46:06)
community day so now it's like well (46:05 - 46:08)
let's see what we can grab out of the (46:06 - 46:10)
trash bin they're not going to spend (46:08 - 46:12)
money on it anyways toss it out there (46:10 - 46:14)
i mean december is always ketchup isn't (46:12 - 46:15)
it now isn't that the past yeah (46:14 - 46:18)
december's always catch up so really i (46:15 - 46:21)
have 11 months that you have to fail (46:18 - 46:21)
yeah (46:24 - 46:26)
i i (46:25 - 46:29)
i (46:26 - 46:29)
no there was it was uh i think it was a (46:33 - 46:38)
starter i think it was snivy (46:36 - 46:40)
oh that sounds familiar or ted pig (46:38 - 46:44)
because oshawa what's the last one right (46:40 - 46:44)
yes yeah yeah yeah (46:44 - 46:47)
but if you think about it in the sense (46:48 - 46:51)
of like we're almost out starters we're (46:49 - 46:54)
almost out of pseudo legendaries (46:51 - 46:55)
you're gonna have (46:54 - 46:57)
i don't want to call them duds like i (46:55 - 47:00)
don't think duskul is a dud of a pokemon (46:57 - 47:04)
like i don't have it i'm excited for it (47:00 - 47:06)
marie (47:04 - 47:08)
was really exciting for a lot of people (47:06 - 47:10)
because because marie was artificially (47:08 - 47:13)
rare in pogo (47:10 - 47:16)
like it's the same thing with litwick (47:13 - 47:18)
like (47:16 - 47:20)
i guess if you only play pogo and you're (47:18 - 47:23)
like wow it looks so rare (47:20 - 47:25)
yeah but like play black and white (47:23 - 47:27)
there's a whole tower dedicated you can (47:25 - 47:30)
100 lit wick every four steps you're (47:27 - 47:32)
getting a lit wick like (47:30 - 47:34)
but those shiny ads are bad i i don't (47:32 - 47:35)
know i don't know (47:34 - 47:36)
i don't want to say like this is (47:35 - 47:38)
niantic's fault that people are upset (47:36 - 47:41)
that it's a dust skull and not a litwick (47:38 - 47:43)
because i feel like they will eventually (47:41 - 47:45)
do litwick oh absolutely why would that (47:43 - 47:48)
be niantic's fault (47:45 - 47:50)
because niantic artificial i don't know (47:48 - 47:51)
like because niantic artificially made (47:50 - 47:53)
litwick rare and so therefore people (47:51 - 47:56)
want litwick i don't know (47:53 - 47:58)
they've made a lot of things (47:56 - 47:59)
artificially rare i will point out that (47:58 - 48:02)
rosalia's are not spotting up here for (47:59 - 48:04)
this autumn event (48:02 - 48:06)
and i'm mad about it i'm not going to (48:04 - 48:07)
write to niantic and say (48:06 - 48:09)
you messed up your hemispheres because (48:07 - 48:13)
it is autumnal at this point (48:09 - 48:15)
i (48:13 - 48:15)
like these are the complaints that (48:16 - 48:21)
muddy the waters when real issues come (48:19 - 48:24)
up yeah like you're right the issue that (48:21 - 48:26)
you don't want dust gold because duskill (48:24 - 48:28)
has been shining for a long time isn't a (48:26 - 48:32)
particularly compelling reason (48:28 - 48:33)
and (48:32 - 48:35)
it undercuts when there is a very (48:33 - 48:37)
compelling reason because you just sound (48:35 - 48:40)
like you yell at everything and this is (48:37 - 48:42)
not a great like you know that at some (48:40 - 48:45)
point like it will probably come it is (48:42 - 48:46)
on a time million percent litwick is (48:45 - 48:49)
going to be a community you know this is (48:46 - 48:51)
going to happen it could happen next (48:49 - 48:53)
year for (48:51 - 48:55)
all we know (48:53 - 48:57)
when you decide to fight these things (48:55 - 48:58)
with the same (48:57 - 49:01)
fever pitch as things like the distance (48:58 - 49:03)
things that were actually life affecting (49:01 - 49:05)
it completely undercuts you as a (49:03 - 49:08)
reliable source (49:05 - 49:08)
and i really wish people would look at (49:08 - 49:12)
like is this a battle that is actually (49:10 - 49:15)
worth fighting and saying that (49:12 - 49:17)
we don't want a shiny dust call are the (49:15 - 49:18)
people who were upset that we're having (49:17 - 49:21)
a shiny rosalia day like this is not a (49:18 - 49:23)
good battle to fight (49:21 - 49:26)
like this isn't even a good reason (49:23 - 49:28)
yeah i think like (49:26 - 49:30)
i think you said it really well greg (49:28 - 49:31)
like i just (49:30 - 49:32)
some community days are going to be (49:31 - 49:34)
awesome and some are not they're all (49:32 - 49:36)
awesome (49:34 - 49:37)
like (49:36 - 49:40)
for you it's not just you if the reason (49:37 - 49:43)
comes down that i already have this your (49:40 - 49:46)
reason is just purely selfish (49:43 - 49:48)
i already have shiny discal and i've had (49:46 - 49:51)
it for a long time so therefore i should (49:48 - 49:53)
get a different pokemon that is a (49:51 - 49:55)
selfish selfish reason and you really (49:53 - 49:59)
need to rethink why you want that (49:55 - 50:02)
yeah (49:59 - 50:02)
i'm not disagreeing with you i know pvp (50:02 - 50:08)
wise (50:05 - 50:11)
i don't think shadowball was the best (50:08 - 50:13)
i think um some smart pvp people maybe (50:11 - 50:15)
suggested counter would have been a (50:13 - 50:16)
better move (50:15 - 50:18)
but (50:16 - 50:19)
i don't i don't want to discredit the (50:18 - 50:21)
pvp just because i don't play it (50:19 - 50:23)
those people know what is good and (50:21 - 50:26)
what's not good and i'm sure for them if (50:23 - 50:28)
the community is doesn't hit the pvp (50:26 - 50:29)
mark it's like well what's the point of (50:28 - 50:32)
even grinding out the specific pokemon (50:29 - 50:34)
so i get it um (50:32 - 50:36)
you get your time back and you don't (50:34 - 50:37)
spend a dollar but let's be real they're (50:36 - 50:39)
gonna grind out anyways because (50:37 - 50:40)
three-time stardust and they're pvp (50:39 - 50:41)
people yeah (50:40 - 50:43)
i don't think you can say you spend a (50:41 - 50:46)
nice day with a book (50:43 - 50:46)
uh (50:49 - 50:52)
yeah i think the the only thing that (50:50 - 50:53)
twitter complaints really did was remind (50:52 - 50:55)
me that duskol was one of the very first (50:53 - 50:56)
shiny pokemon i kind of forgot about (50:55 - 50:57)
that (50:56 - 50:59)
because it was like mad it was pikachu (50:57 - 51:01)
first then it was magikarp and then i (50:59 - 51:04)
think it was duskull (51:01 - 51:06)
because pikachu was like (51:04 - 51:09)
the spring magikarp was the summer and (51:06 - 51:11)
then it was like duskill and stabilized (51:09 - 51:12)
i think were the first two something (51:11 - 51:15)
like that yeah yeah (51:12 - 51:15)
uh (51:16 - 51:18)
anyways (51:17 - 51:19)
i don't know i'm excited i like to call (51:18 - 51:21)
his pokemon i think he's cool (51:19 - 51:23)
i think it also kind of (51:21 - 51:25)
i don't know maybe it's a stretch but (51:23 - 51:28)
they give you center stones (51:25 - 51:30)
dust noir is exclusive like debuted in (51:28 - 51:31)
sinnoh (51:30 - 51:34)
it's cl like i i would maybe besides the (51:31 - 51:35)
whole like hey niantic you finally (51:34 - 51:38)
figured out ghosts in october (51:35 - 51:40)
it's also lead up to the games yeah i (51:38 - 51:43)
would i would maybe guess i would assume (51:40 - 51:44)
oh actually i don't know what they're (51:43 - 51:45)
going to do you know it wouldn't (51:44 - 51:46)
surprise me if they would be like hey (51:45 - 51:49)
we're doing the gen 4 starters all for (51:46 - 51:51)
community (51:49 - 51:52)
or (51:51 - 51:55)
shanks (51:52 - 51:57)
shanks would be a good one (51:55 - 52:00)
but shanks was shiny and raids already (51:57 - 52:01)
yeah i'm sure that would be the (52:00 - 52:03)
complaint that would be the shakes would (52:01 - 52:05)
be (52:03 - 52:06)
i don't have a shiny sinks i would love (52:05 - 52:08)
a shiny sink i had you know i've (52:06 - 52:10)
probably done tiger boy (52:08 - 52:12)
30 (52:10 - 52:14)
to 40 raids for shinx (52:12 - 52:16)
most of those were with my free raid (52:14 - 52:18)
passes because you just walk down the (52:16 - 52:20)
walk one block over do it for free easy (52:18 - 52:21)
enough (52:20 - 52:24)
um i had to shine shakes i traded it to (52:21 - 52:26)
zoe two dots when i met her at pax (52:24 - 52:27)
because she (52:26 - 52:29)
she was looking for a lucky one or (52:27 - 52:31)
something (52:29 - 52:32)
but i don't know i think shanks would be (52:31 - 52:36)
a good one i'm trying to think uh (52:32 - 52:38)
if they haven't had a starly shiny (52:36 - 52:40)
community we've not had starley starly (52:38 - 52:42)
would be pretty good too (52:40 - 52:44)
see but starley would be said no one (52:42 - 52:46)
ever please starling would be in the (52:44 - 52:48)
situation of like new shiny but probably (52:46 - 52:50)
not good competitively at all so i mean (52:48 - 52:52)
raptor is amazing it's a raptor made out (52:50 - 52:55)
of star raptor is amazing said no one (52:52 - 52:58)
ever (52:55 - 52:58)
i would prefer shanks over starly (53:01 - 53:05)
i i would like shanks (53:04 - 53:08)
yeah i would like your shanks also be an (53:05 - 53:09)
electric dark type but i don't get (53:08 - 53:11)
everything that i want well i wouldn't (53:09 - 53:13)
have made it any much better well (53:11 - 53:14)
you don't know that (53:13 - 53:16)
i do (53:14 - 53:18)
love really bad competitively dark type (53:16 - 53:20)
ain't saving it (53:18 - 53:22)
we don't know what different choices (53:20 - 53:24)
could have been made if they had gone (53:22 - 53:28)
electric dark type we don't know (53:24 - 53:28)
the union arrives to the tcg (53:30 - 53:34)
uh is this the thing that the 18 cards (53:34 - 53:40)
go together to form voltron yeah exodia (53:37 - 53:41)
shows up (53:40 - 53:43)
sweet each each pokemon v union has four (53:41 - 53:45)
separate cards that combine to a larger (53:43 - 53:47)
card all four parts of the cards have (53:45 - 53:49)
the same name so using the example above (53:47 - 53:51)
you can only have a total of four (53:49 - 53:53)
youtube v union cards in your deck if (53:51 - 53:55)
you all have all four parts of the v (53:53 - 53:56)
union in the discard pile you can put (53:55 - 53:58)
them into play to assemble a larger (53:56 - 54:00)
pokemon v union once in play treat it (53:58 - 54:02)
like a normal pokemon takes up one spot (54:00 - 54:04)
of your bench you can also have pokemon (54:02 - 54:06)
tools attached to it (54:04 - 54:07)
um (54:06 - 54:09)
one also very (54:07 - 54:10)
big all four (54:09 - 54:12)
parts of a specific venue in your deck (54:10 - 54:16)
must be part of the same illustration (54:12 - 54:16)
it goes on to say how they work but (54:16 - 54:21)
they're coming english they just showed (54:19 - 54:23)
the english when they're coming later (54:21 - 54:25)
this is coming english now (54:23 - 54:27)
they're not going to be in booster packs (54:25 - 54:29)
though which was the concern (54:27 - 54:30)
a couple of months ago when we talked (54:29 - 54:32)
about this (54:30 - 54:34)
uh in japan they weren't in booster (54:32 - 54:35)
packs either you usually just had to buy (54:34 - 54:37)
like (54:35 - 54:39)
it was like three booster packs and then (54:37 - 54:40)
like this (54:39 - 54:43)
uh these four cards so (54:40 - 54:45)
how'd they do on the meta (54:43 - 54:47)
uh i don't know i think one of them is (54:45 - 54:49)
specifically good (54:47 - 54:53)
might be the zashian one (54:49 - 54:53)

my eyesight is going bad which one on (62:11 - 62:15)
this is pancham (62:12 - 62:15)
wow this is a tiny bad picture (62:16 - 62:21)
oh maybe i confused pancham it looked (62:19 - 62:23)
like a tart wig to me maybe that's the (62:21 - 62:25)
paint jam (62:23 - 62:28)
yeah i think that the one that's way off (62:25 - 62:29)
to the side (62:28 - 62:30)
it looks like a tert wig but i think (62:29 - 62:33)
that's the panchi oh yeah that's (62:30 - 62:34)
probably the pain it's real this picture (62:33 - 62:36)
is bad (62:34 - 62:39)
yeah it's it's pretty low res (62:36 - 62:39)
here's the problem with oreos (62:39 - 62:45)
nothing they are good cookie they are an (62:42 - 62:48)
amazing cookie the fork strategy is (62:45 - 62:50)
terrible very good it is the problem (62:48 - 62:52)
with oreos is their price (62:50 - 62:55)
and the packaging stays the same (62:52 - 62:57)
but there's less oreos every time you (62:55 - 62:59)
buy it fewer oreos yes (62:57 - 63:02)
they like do some magic on the inside (62:59 - 63:05)
where they like usually like i feel like (63:02 - 63:07)
10 years ago when i opened an oreo (63:05 - 63:10)
package i was like 40 oreos and then (63:07 - 63:13)
five years ago it was like 35 oreos and (63:10 - 63:14)
now i feel like when i open oreos it's (63:13 - 63:16)
like 10. (63:14 - 63:19)
oh yeah there's only 10 in there (63:16 - 63:21)
i think (63:19 - 63:22)
you are thinking that the packaging has (63:21 - 63:25)
stays the same size it has not it has (63:22 - 63:27)
shrunk (63:25 - 63:29)
and (63:27 - 63:32)
that is how the world goes we are our (63:29 - 63:34)
oreo supply (63:32 - 63:37)
has been lowering for years (63:34 - 63:39)
oreos (63:37 - 63:39)
there's not many oreos left in the wild (63:40 - 63:44)
uh and they don't breed well in (63:42 - 63:47)
captivity true true and they had to do (63:44 - 63:48)
so much inbreeding to make all the (63:47 - 63:51)
variant oreos like oreo is just an (63:48 - 63:54)
endangered species period so be happy (63:51 - 63:56)
with what you get and stop thinking you (63:54 - 63:58)
deserve it's amazing they don't crumble (63:56 - 63:59)
in your fingers the second you pull them (63:58 - 64:02)
out and then there's a bunch of fools (63:59 - 64:04)
out there that dirty dishes by stabbing (64:02 - 64:07)
them pointlessly with a fork (64:04 - 64:09)

i'm gonna say aj with the sand shrew (65:49 - 65:53)
uh i mean anime y is nando because nando (65:54 - 66:00)
is outstanding but npc (65:57 - 66:02)
stands for (66:00 - 66:05)
non-player character so that pretty much (66:02 - 66:07)
limits it to (66:05 - 66:11)
the actual games okay yes (66:07 - 66:12)
uh (66:11 - 66:15)
it's not youngster joey it's not todd (66:12 - 66:17)
because todd's annoying ah it's not so (66:15 - 66:20)
good (66:17 - 66:22)
he calls too much (66:20 - 66:24)
he calls when there are deals and if (66:22 - 66:26)
there happens to be a bunch of deals (66:24 - 66:28)

rattata battled again (66:36 - 66:40)
like (66:38 - 66:40)
no we're gonna let that thing evolve no (66:40 - 66:44)
he doesn't know how that's why todd is (66:43 - 66:47)
the worst (66:44 - 66:48)
mine's easy (66:47 - 66:50)
but very specific (66:48 - 66:54)
pokemon veteran in the gen 5 games (66:50 - 66:57)
there you go that i tried to replicate (66:54 - 67:00)
that style it's not easy to do but heart (66:57 - 67:03)
break charles (67:00 - 67:05)
that's (67:03 - 67:06)
that (67:05 - 67:09)
but you hate triple battles (67:06 - 67:10)
but (67:09 - 67:13)
he is the perfect villain heartbreak (67:10 - 67:15)
charles is right because he's made (67:13 - 67:16)
battles (67:15 - 67:18)
because he we he knows everyone hates (67:16 - 67:21)
triple battles so he forces you to do it (67:18 - 67:24)
he's like a heel in wrestling (67:21 - 67:26)
you can't help but hate him but you hate (67:24 - 67:28)
him so much you love them do we count (67:26 - 67:31)
like gym leaders and trial leaders (67:28 - 67:33)
npcs they're non-player characters yeah (67:31 - 67:35)
but heartbreak charles for pokemon (67:33 - 67:38)
masters move aside (67:35 - 67:41)

your single most expensive pokemon i (69:08 - 69:13)

120 at the time (69:15 - 69:19)
wait was that pokemon center (69:18 - 69:22)
no no it's fossil (69:19 - 69:24)
fossil watches did a 10-year anniversary (69:22 - 69:26)
pikachu watch i thought they did a (69:24 - 69:27)
20-year anniversary and you could get (69:26 - 69:29)
off pokemon they did or something (69:27 - 69:32)
but they also did a 10-year and i have (69:29 - 69:34)
it and then the battery died so i just (69:32 - 69:35)
have to watch you can replace the (69:34 - 69:38)
battery yeah but then i stopped wearing (69:35 - 69:40)
it seven battery watch things in a mall (69:38 - 69:41)
that's all the mall is at this point but (69:40 - 69:43)
i got a different watch i got this watch (69:41 - 69:45)
that i can customize (69:43 - 69:47)

and i was like i'm going to open these (71:08 - 71:12)
in 30 seconds and i'm gonna do like fast (71:10 - 71:14)
cuts or whatever (71:12 - 71:15)
because i like (71:14 - 71:18)
what i saw on tiktok was like just (71:15 - 71:20)
people opening like mechanical keyboard (71:18 - 71:22)
stuff and they did like fast cut of like (71:20 - 71:26)
slicing the box fast cut of like (71:22 - 71:28)
whatever pulling it out you've seen like (71:26 - 71:29)
tic toc unboxings they're like really (71:28 - 71:31)
quick and i was like oh i'll do this (71:29 - 71:33)
with the pokeball whatever didn't think (71:31 - 71:35)
anything of it (71:33 - 71:36)
i put i i did it with pokeball and i did (71:35 - 71:37)
with the master ball i put them on tik (71:36 - 71:41)
tok they got like 2 000 views or (71:37 - 71:43)
whatever you know some tick tocks do (71:41 - 71:47)
well some don't i put that pokeball (71:43 - 71:49)
same video just copy and pasted it put (71:47 - 71:52)
it on instagram (71:49 - 71:52)
reels almost a million views on both of (71:53 - 71:57)
them (71:56 - 71:59)
on reels and i was like what is (71:57 - 72:01)
happening right now (71:59 - 72:03)
people are bored and then i was like (72:01 - 72:04)
well (72:03 - 72:06)
might as well put it on youtube shorts (72:04 - 72:08)
so i put that in pokeball master ball on (72:06 - 72:09)
youtube shorts (72:08 - 72:11)
and (72:09 - 72:13)
after like two weeks it had like three (72:11 - 72:14)
thousand views and i was like i don't (72:13 - 72:16)
know why this didn't do well on tick (72:14 - 72:17)
tock i mean it almost has a million (72:16 - 72:19)
views on reels (72:17 - 72:21)
and then a month (72:19 - 72:24)
later just randomly it went from 3 000 (72:21 - 72:27)
views to a million views (72:24 - 72:29)
and now as of this recording which is (72:27 - 72:31)
only a month after this it's over four (72:29 - 72:34)
million views there's nothing like it (72:31 - 72:35)
took a while for the algorithm to get to (72:34 - 72:37)
you yeah was like the only thing i've (72:35 - 72:39)
learned is that everyone just assumes (72:37 - 72:41)
that it's plastic and i've wasted my (72:39 - 72:42)
money (72:41 - 72:45)
[Laughter] (72:42 - 72:47)
i haven't done a luxury ball and i (72:45 - 72:48)
refuse (72:47 - 72:50)
the amount of assumptions people have in (72:48 - 72:53)
a 29 second video is out like (72:50 - 72:57)
like like you have thought more about my (72:53 - 73:00)
29 second pokeball video (72:57 - 73:02)
than it took me to record and post this (73:00 - 73:04)
video like (73:02 - 73:06)
where your mind has gone about who i am (73:04 - 73:08)
as a person what i have done with my (73:06 - 73:11)
money how much i have in my 401k and (73:08 - 73:14)
what kind of material this is you have (73:11 - 73:16)
all put way too much thought to leave a (73:14 - 73:17)
negative youtube comment which is fine (73:16 - 73:19)
you're only boosting the algorithm more (73:17 - 73:21)
by leaving your negative comment but (73:19 - 73:23)
what that's called heck yeah (73:21 - 73:25)
that's called a rent-free living but i (73:23 - 73:27)
have spent now (73:25 - 73:31)
400 on metal pokemons (73:27 - 73:32)
all right (73:31 - 73:33)
i'm i'm (73:32 - 73:34)
this question (73:33 - 73:37)
has actually now made me (73:34 - 73:39)
sad (73:37 - 73:40)
and (73:39 - 73:41)
unhappy (73:40 - 73:43)
because (73:41 - 73:45)
in thinking about it the most i ever (73:43 - 73:48)
spent on pokemon (73:45 - 73:50)
was when i bought (73:48 - 73:54)
two copies of tropical beach oh my gosh (73:50 - 73:55)
i was gonna say this for somebody who i (73:54 - 73:57)
was dating (73:55 - 74:00)
now when i bought those i think they (73:57 - 74:01)
were 130 (74:00 - 74:05)
each so that both of them cost me 260. i (74:01 - 74:06)
just (74:05 - 74:08)
looked on tcgplayer (74:06 - 74:12)
for how much a single tropical beach (74:08 - 74:15)
costs the lowest price is four hundred (74:12 - 74:18)
and thirty three dollars (74:15 - 74:18)
the real ancient mew (74:19 - 74:21)
yeah (74:20 - 74:22)
that's real (74:21 - 74:24)
that's real that's what that is and i (74:22 - 74:26)
could have used a tropical beach nobody (74:24 - 74:30)
was buying me a tropical beach (74:26 - 74:30)
yesterday why didn't you buy willa (74:30 - 74:34)
tropical do you put that on your uh (74:32 - 74:35)
tinder (74:34 - 74:38)
will i will buy you a tropical by (74:35 - 74:40)
tropical beach no that's how you get the (74:38 - 74:43)
guys at that (74:40 - 74:43)
what's that what's that one dating app (74:44 - 74:47)
with the uh (74:46 - 74:50)
the prompts i think that's hinge maybe (74:47 - 74:52)
uh hinge is the one where you have to (74:50 - 74:54)
respond to something that somebody (74:52 - 74:56)
posted like a photo or one of their (74:54 - 74:58)
things so yeah that's probably the one (74:56 - 75:01)
you're thinking of yeah like i think (74:58 - 75:03)
i think it's like i i don't i look i (75:01 - 75:07)
haven't dated anyone in 11 years (75:03 - 75:07)
i haven't dated somebody in 28. uh what (75:08 - 75:14)
is hinge it's just a thinking app yeah i (75:11 - 75:16)
think the thing it has is like it forces (75:14 - 75:18)
you to answer something because like (75:16 - 75:20)
people don't know what to put so like (75:18 - 75:22)
you have to have a series like you have (75:20 - 75:24)
photos it tells you like put this kind (75:22 - 75:27)
of a photo and then it has like respond (75:24 - 75:29)
to this question but you could you could (75:27 - 75:32)
change the question if you wanted to yes (75:29 - 75:34)
but the thing is like somebody can't (75:32 - 75:37)
directly send me a message saying hi (75:34 - 75:39)
will your beautiful eyes because you (75:37 - 75:41)
know i haven't heard that 50 000 times (75:39 - 75:43)
let's get creative kids (75:41 - 75:45)
they i will you have terrible eyes they (75:43 - 75:47)
offend me deeply (75:45 - 75:49)
and say (75:47 - 75:52)
like the make comment on the photo or if (75:49 - 75:54)
i say i like to play pokemon and card (75:52 - 75:56)
fight vanguard then they have to respond (75:54 - 75:57)
to that statement they can't just reach (75:56 - 76:00)
out to me directly based on my profile (75:57 - 76:01)
uh (76:00 - 76:02)
so i think one of the most popular (76:01 - 76:05)
hinged ones is like tell two truths and (76:02 - 76:08)
a lie and so on a lot of things yeah so (76:05 - 76:10)
then yeah look i only know that this (76:08 - 76:11)
because tick tock (76:10 - 76:14)
is also built on an acclaimed nobel (76:11 - 76:17)
prize winning algorithm (76:14 - 76:17)
okay so i feel like that's not true so (76:18 - 76:23)
with expensive things i also bought two (76:20 - 76:25)
tropical beaches (76:23 - 76:26)
i had a (76:25 - 76:28)
uh staff (76:26 - 76:30)
promo tropical tropical beach which was (76:28 - 76:33)
i think i paid 130 for it and it just (76:30 - 76:35)
said staff on it (76:33 - 76:37)
um and it was given out to people who (76:35 - 76:38)
were staff members at worlds or (76:37 - 76:39)
nationals (76:38 - 76:41)
they got it for free (76:39 - 76:43)
some people sold that obviously and then (76:41 - 76:44)
i had a top (76:43 - 76:46)
16 (76:44 - 76:48)
tropical beach which again was somebody (76:46 - 76:50)
who placed top 16. now the interesting (76:48 - 76:52)
thing about that (76:50 - 76:53)
is it didn't matter if you played the (76:52 - 76:57)
vgc or the tcg you got a top 16 no (76:53 - 76:58)
matter what (76:57 - 77:01)
so i would safely assume that if you (76:58 - 77:04)
were a tcg player you kept the tropical (77:01 - 77:06)
beach because it was one of the best (77:04 - 77:08)
cards you could have in a deck and i (77:06 - 77:10)
would assume that the vgc players were (77:08 - 77:12)
like i'm never going to do this (77:10 - 77:14)
let me sell it pretty easy (77:12 - 77:15)
100 to 200 (77:14 - 77:18)
and i did the same thing as well did is (77:15 - 77:21)
well i sold my tropical beaches to a (77:18 - 77:22)
friend (77:21 - 77:24)
and then realized that they (77:22 - 77:26)
dramatically went up in price and now (77:24 - 77:28)
they're gonna be top 16 worlds 12 (77:26 - 77:31)
tropical beach is as low as eight (77:28 - 77:35)
hundred and forty eight dollars (77:31 - 77:35)
i guess they're still good in expanded (77:35 - 77:38)
format huh yeah they're still really (77:37 - 77:40)
good (77:38 - 77:40)
are there two tropical beaches or is (77:41 - 77:46)
there a little beach it's been 10 (77:43 - 77:50)
years there are two different beaches (77:46 - 77:51)
there are two different tropical beaches (77:50 - 77:54)
um but they do they the art is different (77:51 - 77:56)
but they do exactly the same thing (77:54 - 77:58)
oh i see this as listed as worlds 11 and (77:56 - 78:01)
this is listed as world's 12. yep yeah (77:58 - 78:03)
one has like a ted pig on it and then (78:01 - 78:05)
one doesn't (78:03 - 78:07)
auschwitz navy and a psyduck in the (78:05 - 78:10)
swimming pool and then it's pikachu with (78:07 - 78:12)
the elemental monkeys which is clearly (78:10 - 78:14)
the inferior one you want worlds 11. (78:12 - 78:17)
definitely i think i had the monkey one (78:14 - 78:18)
uh so (78:17 - 78:20)
for the question was what's the most (78:18 - 78:21)
amount of money you've spent on pokemon (78:20 - 78:24)
for tcg cards that was the most i've (78:21 - 78:26)
never spent over a hundred dollars on a (78:24 - 78:28)
call what a single card (78:26 - 78:30)
in tropical beach was (78:28 - 78:34)
i bought two for a deck (78:30 - 78:36)
uh i can't fathom spending that much (78:34 - 78:37)
money on that card (78:36 - 78:41)
like i couldn't (78:37 - 78:41)
bring myself to spend (78:42 - 78:47)
over ten dollars on a magic card like (78:44 - 78:49)
what does everything like i don't really (78:47 - 78:50)
need that (78:49 - 78:53)
i spent like 185 on a magic card i know (78:50 - 78:58)
you did i spent 250 on the skateboard (78:53 - 79:00)
all right you bought the skateboard (78:58 - 79:02)
bought the skateboard (79:00 - 79:03)
um (79:02 - 79:07)
do you spend a lot of money (79:03 - 79:07)
how well i can open them up on tick-tock (79:07 - 79:11)
[Laughter] (79:09 - 79:13)
and make no money (79:11 - 79:16)
all of those salty people on my on my (79:13 - 79:17)
youtube (79:16 - 79:20)
if i would have said (79:17 - 79:22)
would you spend a hundred dollars to get (79:20 - 79:24)
four million views on a youtube video i (79:22 - 79:26)
bet they would say yes well because (79:24 - 79:28)
youtube you're you're monetized you know (79:26 - 79:30)
what's funny is youtube shorts cannot be (79:28 - 79:32)
monetized i have made you've made zero (79:30 - 79:35)
money so no i would not spend a hundred (79:32 - 79:38)
dollars to get four billion views on (79:35 - 79:40)
something that doesn't make me money (79:38 - 79:42)
it gets you subscribers though (79:40 - 79:43)
which (79:42 - 79:45)
i've probably gotten (79:43 - 79:49)
5 000 subscribers from that video alone (79:45 - 79:52)
and ideally you would hope or want those (79:49 - 79:53)
subscribers to watch your other stuff (79:52 - 79:55)
convert into views yeah yeah i don't (79:53 - 79:56)
know whether they're converting any (79:55 - 79:57)
views (79:56 - 79:58)
if you're a subscriber that watch this (79:57 - 80:00)
short and convert it into a view leave a (79:58 - 80:03)

lot i have spent 99 (80:20 - 80:26)
on a (80:24 - 80:30)
complete inbox copy of platinum used (80:26 - 80:33)
uh (80:30 - 80:33)
which i think now is because of the (80:33 - 80:36)
pandemic has probably gone up to like (80:35 - 80:39)
200 bucks (80:36 - 80:39)
uh they just put some commemorative (80:40 - 80:44)
coins on pokemon center (80:41 - 80:46)
this weekend that was 129 i purchased (80:44 - 80:47)

wha (80:47 - 80:50)
what is it what (80:48 - 80:52)

room he is sitting look at this disaster (80:56 - 81:01)
i'm putting it on pokemon (80:58 - 81:04)

greg of course i'm going to waste money (81:04 - 81:07)
on commemorative coins (81:05 - 81:09)
dump that and don't put it in the (81:07 - 81:10)
movement (81:09 - 81:12)

ah buy that (81:17 - 81:20)
i buy things so then i tell other people (81:22 - 81:27)
not to buy them (81:24 - 81:27)
that is awful (81:30 - 81:33)
well we're talking about it now in the (81:33 - 81:36)
show so maybe it's not that awful there (81:35 - 81:39)
you go pretty bad (81:36 - 81:41)
dragonite eve (81:39 - 81:43)
navy lounge pants oh there are some of (81:41 - 81:44)
them (81:43 - 81:46)
oh i got to get some of them tights i'm (81:44 - 81:48)
i'm into the tight life now how are you (81:46 - 81:49)
yeah (81:48 - 81:52)
i have a tick tock for you (81:49 - 81:54)
no no tights on me not tights on other (81:52 - 81:56)
people i know but i have a tic tac for (81:54 - 81:58)
you oh dear (81:56 - 82:00)
uh (81:58 - 82:02)
i have purchased all of those pikachu (82:00 - 82:06)
year with funko that was 12 times (82:02 - 82:08)
15. what's the math on that (82:06 - 82:10)
i need to come up with some product that (82:08 - 82:12)
you're very into so that i can just take (82:10 - 82:14)
all your money from you oh you know you (82:12 - 82:16)
know what's not the most expensive thing (82:14 - 82:18)
i bought but my favorite thing i've (82:16 - 82:19)
bought (82:18 - 82:21)
was when i was in japan (82:19 - 82:22)
they (82:21 - 82:25)
at the same time they released a pikachu (82:22 - 82:27)
wedding collection with different (82:25 - 82:29)
pikachu wedding things and (82:27 - 82:32)
my wife and i we went to (82:29 - 82:33)
six different pokemon centers and we (82:32 - 82:36)
finally found it at like the fourth one (82:33 - 82:37)
we went to (82:36 - 82:40)
and there's there's these pikachu um (82:37 - 82:42)
champagne flutes (82:40 - 82:44)
and i think it was like (82:42 - 82:46)
there's a song about those (82:44 - 82:50)
7 000 yen which is about 60 (82:46 - 82:52)
um and they only had two left and we got (82:50 - 82:53)
one (82:52 - 82:55)
and so (82:53 - 82:57)
um that's probably my favorite (82:55 - 83:00)
pokemon item i have and we bring those (82:57 - 83:00)
out (83:00 - 83:02)
uh on our anniversary (83:00 - 83:04)
uh but they just have like little (83:02 - 83:06)
like they have like a pikachu and a suit (83:04 - 83:08)
and then like pichu and a wedding dress (83:06 - 83:10)
uh they don't make them anymore i'm sure (83:08 - 83:11)
they're really hard to find and or and (83:10 - 83:14)
or no one cares because like the kind of (83:11 - 83:16)
very specific target market (83:14 - 83:19)
yeah it's for weddings (83:16 - 83:20)
yeah so um (83:19 - 83:23)
that's probably my favorite thing (83:20 - 83:25)
there's not like there's not like a (83:23 - 83:27)
single pokemon item that seems very (83:25 - 83:28)
expensive unless you're talking about (83:27 - 83:30)
like a specific game like pokemon box (83:28 - 83:32)
obviously um (83:30 - 83:33)
maybe like (83:32 - 83:35)
pikachu nintendo 64. i would assume (83:33 - 83:36)
probably is kind of expensive i would (83:35 - 83:40)
guess well i actually i purchased (83:36 - 83:42)
i purchased the (83:40 - 83:44)
pokemon specific switches (83:42 - 83:45)
i think that's probably the most (83:44 - 83:48)
expensive thing i purchased oh yeah like (83:45 - 83:51)
200 bucks i would imagine right now a (83:48 - 83:53)
sealed copy of heart gold soul silver (83:51 - 83:55)
with pokey walker (83:53 - 83:57)
that's gonna that's gonna run you some (83:55 - 83:58)
cash (83:57 - 83:59)
yeah (83:58 - 84:01)
i mean i have this giant be out that was (83:59 - 84:05)

it still wasn't a yamper with a joltik (85:13 - 85:17)
biting it on the butt so it's not good (85:15 - 85:18)
enough (85:17 - 85:20)

displayed behind me i see nothing but (85:20 - 85:25)
books keyboard keyboards (85:23 - 85:31)
[Laughter] (85:25 - 85:31)
there you go (85:33 - 85:39)
in the bag not a disgrace (85:35 - 85:39)
i take them places and use them i even (85:39 - 85:44)
spent this is this is how bad it is i (85:42 - 85:45)
spent years i'm like greg which of the (85:44 - 85:47)
which of those do you like i remember (85:45 - 85:50)
you talking to me about this (85:47 - 85:50)
because i am a thoughtful human being (85:51 - 85:56)
you are (85:54 - 85:56)
uh speaking of thoughtful pokemon of the (85:56 - 86:01)
week all right last week's pokemon (85:58 - 86:04)
started out i made a commentary about (86:01 - 86:06)
the fact that in galler the fossil (86:04 - 86:08)
pokemon don't evolve even though there's (86:06 - 86:10)
still four (86:08 - 86:12)
fossil pokemon available in the gala (86:10 - 86:16)
region uh and then i did a twist (86:12 - 86:20)
i made it tcg relevant yeah so i didn't (86:16 - 86:22)
say the wrong one i said it's a (86:20 - 86:24)
you got to pick up on the the key points (86:22 - 86:26)
that it's a basic v (86:24 - 86:29)
so it's a v pokemon there's fewer of (86:26 - 86:32)
those and they also say it's a basic (86:29 - 86:35)
uh has two attacks (86:32 - 86:37)
and the first is if it's attack if the (86:35 - 86:40)
defending is a v or gx (86:37 - 86:42)
then it prevents that pokemon from (86:40 - 86:44)
attacking during the opponent's next (86:42 - 86:44)
turn (86:44 - 86:47)
and then this pokemon second attack does (86:44 - 86:49)
a lot of damage but then it can attack (86:47 - 86:51)
during its next turn (86:49 - 86:53)
but then you keep in mind that the (86:51 - 86:55)
cannot attack clause is you can work (86:53 - 86:57)
around it if you're able to somehow (86:55 - 87:00)
retreat the active pokemon and then make (86:57 - 87:02)
it active again and i mentioned (87:00 - 87:04)
blastoise keldeo because keldeo had the (87:02 - 87:06)
russian skill which allowed you to (87:04 - 87:08)
retreat your active pokemon without (87:06 - 87:10)
actually actually retreating it so then (87:08 - 87:11)
you could retreat the kill deal with a (87:10 - 87:13)
float stone and put your active pokemon (87:11 - 87:14)
active again (87:13 - 87:16)
love the float stone (87:14 - 87:19)
is that still is it still legal it's (87:16 - 87:20)
just there's something out there there's (87:19 - 87:23)
like a skateboard or something dumb (87:20 - 87:24)
yeah i think it was i think it was a (87:23 - 87:27)
skateboard actually (87:24 - 87:27)
so there you go do it because i've got (87:29 - 87:34)
the wrong one so you have to say it (87:30 - 87:35)
it's (87:34 - 87:38)
geodude (87:35 - 87:38)
i say the wrong one you say the right (87:38 - 87:41)
one (87:40 - 87:42)
you don't even know how to do this is (87:41 - 87:44)
your own show we've done like five (87:42 - 87:46)
million episodes and you played victini (87:44 - 87:48)
with the victory piece (87:46 - 87:50)
i know (87:48 - 87:53)
and victory is a fire pokemon i actually (87:50 - 87:54)
wrote (87:53 - 87:56)
i actually wrote down draco fish (87:54 - 87:59)
you're close it's arctivish okay i don't (87:56 - 88:01)
know anything about the tcg (87:59 - 88:03)
steve you said you knew this one because (88:01 - 88:05)
of the tcg yeah i mean victini is very (88:03 - 88:07)
good in the tcg (88:05 - 88:10)
but let's set the clues (88:07 - 88:12)
i just wanted the same thing (88:10 - 88:15)
big teeny is very good in the tcg yeah (88:12 - 88:17)
maybe it is now that wasn't when i was (88:15 - 88:20)
pushing that guy hard (88:17 - 88:20)
well it wasn't kind of it was like a (88:20 - 88:24)
more victini one victory piece and a (88:22 - 88:27)
thousand fire energies no you had to use (88:24 - 88:29)
victini to let you flip again (88:27 - 88:32)
no that's flip teeny that guy (88:29 - 88:36)
got rotated out yeah he's gone (88:32 - 88:36)
so which one is it velozolt arctivish oh (88:36 - 88:41)
arctivish (88:40 - 88:43)
to be fair i don't think i've ever (88:41 - 88:45)
looked at the arto vish tcg card (88:43 - 88:47)
i just basically read the entirety of it (88:45 - 88:50)
to you (88:47 - 88:50)
uh arctivist shares its category with (88:51 - 88:55)
aerodactyl dracovish arctovish arto zolt (88:53 - 88:57)
and draco fish they're all known as the (88:55 - 88:59)
fossil pokemon (88:57 - 89:02)
um arctovish dracozolt arc (88:59 - 89:04)
zolt and dracovish are the only fossil (89:02 - 89:08)
pokemon not to be rock or have a gender (89:04 - 89:09)
arcto fish along with the other (89:08 - 89:11)
gallerian fossils were designed by (89:09 - 89:15)
hitoshi aryaga (89:11 - 89:18)
uh in the anime keralis is the person (89:15 - 89:21)
who gives arcto vish its species name (89:18 - 89:24)
okay what did what does this designer do (89:21 - 89:26)
oh this is the (89:24 - 89:28)
um (89:26 - 89:30)
this is the enkei malamar pangaro mega (89:28 - 89:35)
bee drill alolan geodude guy (89:30 - 89:35)
for these that weird black and white (89:41 - 89:45)
grayscale stuff i like it (89:43 - 89:48)
i like that they're all like grayscale (89:45 - 89:49)
because they're not (89:48 - 89:51)
complete (89:49 - 89:54)
they're wrong (89:51 - 89:54)
she's so careless that careless (89:54 - 90:00)
i like these fossils a lot i wish they (89:57 - 90:02)
had done something where you could make (90:00 - 90:03)
them into what they're actually supposed (90:02 - 90:05)
to be (90:03 - 90:07)
because it bothers me it's boring that (90:05 - 90:10)
when they you put them together correct (90:07 - 90:12)
it's just it'll be like the the next (90:10 - 90:15)
region will have the actual form is it's (90:12 - 90:17)
these fossils but the way they're (90:15 - 90:20)
supposed to be (90:17 - 90:20)
i mean there's a lot of great artists (90:23 - 90:26)
that have put them together the right (90:25 - 90:28)
way and some of those look really good (90:26 - 90:31)
yeah but most of them just look boring (90:28 - 90:34)
what do you mean (90:31 - 90:34)
either way (90:35 - 90:40)
it looks like dinosaur (90:37 - 90:40)
are you ready for this week's pokemon (90:40 - 90:43)
ready (90:42 - 90:44)
all right (90:43 - 90:46)
i don't want complaints about how i'm (90:44 - 90:50)
butchering anything with this so (90:46 - 90:52)
ohio gozaimasu (90:50 - 90:55)
in today's episode of japanese chori we (90:52 - 90:57)
are discussing preparation of the (90:55 - 90:59)
delicious parshen (90:57 - 91:01)
parshen should always be plucked fresh (90:59 - 91:04)
from the mizu and if uncooked seasoned (91:01 - 91:06)
and served on koori (91:04 - 91:09)

sheru before serving itadakimasu (91:09 - 91:14)
[Laughter] (91:22 - 91:26)
that's pretty much it (91:28 - 91:32)

nah how rude (91:32 - 91:37)
how would you even eat a single meal my (91:34 - 91:39)
favorite memory (91:37 - 91:42)

sorry to bother you (92:18 - 92:22)
he's correct (92:20 - 92:24)
i'm really sorry because i'm american (92:22 - 92:28)
you are just sorry for existing (92:24 - 92:30)
well here's the thing if you're if (92:28 - 92:32)
you're getting ready to eat in japan (92:30 - 92:33)
you don't have to put your hands (92:32 - 92:36)
together although that is a common thing (92:33 - 92:39)
and then you just say it (92:36 - 92:41)
it's just a courtesy before you eat (92:39 - 92:45)
but we we went so we when i met andrew (92:41 - 92:47)
we were at the um (92:45 - 92:49)

the mall (93:09 - 93:12)
food court and (93:10 - 93:15)
and so it's me andrew irene (93:12 - 93:18)
and andrew is not japanese by the way (93:15 - 93:20)
he's from new zealand correct he's a (93:18 - 93:23)
kiwi he's he's lived he's lived in japan (93:20 - 93:26)
for what 15. a very long time 15 almost (93:23 - 93:28)
20 years probably a very long time very (93:26 - 93:31)
long time a chunk of the life (93:28 - 93:33)
and so we're we when you go to the (93:31 - 93:35)
restaurant it's like some uh like they (93:33 - 93:37)
have a bunch of different kind of curry (93:35 - 93:41)
and we had probably the most (93:37 - 93:42)
japanese (93:41 - 93:44)
stereotypical (93:42 - 93:46)
waiter that is like (93:44 - 93:48)
like the the one that you see in an (93:46 - 93:50)
anime that like i hate american (93:48 - 93:52)
stereotypes (93:50 - 93:54)
and you could just tell that he was not (93:52 - 93:57)
happy that we were his table (93:54 - 94:00)
and like the look on his face his pot (93:57 - 94:02)
like his posture (94:00 - 94:04)
like every body language being like i do (94:02 - 94:06)
not want to serve these people (94:04 - 94:08)
and then andrew busts out this fluent (94:06 - 94:10)
japanese to the guy and he like just (94:08 - 94:13)
changed his well yeah (94:10 - 94:15)
it's like when we go out to eat with you (94:13 - 94:17)

restaurant that you like (94:17 - 94:21)
we are prepped for the worst experiences (94:19 - 94:23)
of our life and we are pleased as punch (94:21 - 94:25)
when you're like oh i found like four (94:23 - 94:28)
things on this menu i eat this is a 100 (94:25 - 94:30)
true story but (94:28 - 94:32)
i was out on my bike this morning i (94:30 - 94:34)
wasn't doing my normal route i was i (94:32 - 94:36)
took my bike just to go around southdale (94:34 - 94:38)
and i noticed that there's a like (94:36 - 94:41)
freestanding shake shack and the literal (94:38 - 94:43)
thought that came to my head was oh if i (94:41 - 94:45)
ever have to go out to dinner with steve (94:43 - 94:48)
