[Music] all right what's up everyone welcome to the 478th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello hello my arm itches still yeah that's the i'm at the stage hazing intro to the tattoo life dude get used to it you got the witch for another tattoo no i do not somebody said oh it the addiction starts i said it took me 51 years to decide to get this one so the next one would be after i'm dead apparently got it will here shout out to uh any venues out there that have concerts or any other social gatherings where you have a parking lot guess what if you have people to guide folks into the parking lot and spaces please also have people to guide people out of the parking lot and the parking spaces i was literally stuck in a parking lot for an hour last night after the event ended ah minneapolis we can do better [Music] maybe debatable uh we have some pokemon news for you all this week a lot of things that should have been maybe announced months ago got announced this week so hey we're moving right along uh before i forget because it's not on my news doc yet but i did have that tweet open is that if you spend all right play the news music we're getting into things you're killing yourself to play the news music if you spend 15 at gamestop oh boy on pokemon related collectibles you will get a doralodon tcg card with the gamestop logo embossed on it now very important another possible card you could put next to your ancient mew in the closet we don't know you know how much this gamestop stamped doralod is going to be worth in the future but does it have a pikachu on it no just does it have a chair is there on it nope no no it does not we know what it's worth then two zeros correct greg oh i was uh sometimes on our twitch streams we uh we we go to ebay yeah r or the collective listener fan base oh that's what contributes to the problem i like this sports team thing it's still yours you are still benefiting from it we have yet to be invited well uh last time i checked you guys were in minnesota uh last time i checked uh that is correct because we chose correctly with our life choices you know if i could be chosen to not go to mps and have the parents i have uh you know and would have made those choices okay so sometimes we look at ebay and we we found this auction that was they were selling it looked like a mom selling her son's pokemon collection oh he went to college and i'm gonna say they wanted two thousand seven hundred dollars for everything on the table and it was not worth two thousand seven hundred dollars but hey are you including the memories in there that she's selling because i think that's probably worth two thousand dollars but it reminded me that there was a bunch of cards that came out at toys r us with the toys r us logo on them and i don't have those cards and i'm a sucker for promotional stuff you can just leave the promotional stuff off you're just a sucker do you mean during the 20th anniversary when they had that cross promotion with toys r us and you could just go in and get tcg cards except they were always out of them remember when toys r us was a thing was toys r us open during five years ago yes yeah it must have been like shortly after that they closed yes 2017 uh anyways i looked up those cards separately and they're like ten dollars a piece so they're not uh june 29th 2018 oh 28 permanently closed uh so that it wasn't like they were specifically they they didn't raise in value like we make lay out the truth here i mean we we talk about how much the hmu is worth but it it it it ain't worth a lot either now those burger king gold coins oh yeah well they're made out of solid gold that's yeah that's right that's an investment for the future when we run out of things that that need gold we can sell those in for billions everyone's talking that bitcoin but i'm talking that poly world gold coin that's the that's another currency an ancient new cryptocurrency i think there is somebody who started a pokemon cryptocurrency uh we can't um i don't think it i i don't think it lasted probably honestly for the best honestly for the best uh okay some more news here we actually got some like decent news this week nothing like big but like smaller good things so the first one being off pokemon.com pokemon master journey the series available on netflix uh we're gonna cut straight to the chase again here bad theme song i heard oh i haven't heard it yet how do we know it's a bad theme song who said i've i've heard from various people on uh discord and twitch and uh i don't think anything greg and i are the arbiters of good music the journey's theme song was a banger i mean yes it was good and this is the master journey yeah now i have to look it up all right master journey pokemon theme song take me on a journey well i wonder if this is the japanese one journey to your heart i can tell you in the first three seconds it is worse pokemon master journey's full opening theme song oh yeah there it is 40 seconds i have a 40 second space oh i am into this it was bad it's it's not good oh good lyrics that kick me in a journey to your heart that is a bop i am into it jay popped me up friends yeah i've been here with my glowy sticks doing the hand motions heck yeah you here's the thing it is not as good as journey stars today journey starts today was very very good this is good the best themes possibly top three it's probably the best theme but i had to listen to the horrible sinnoh wrap when i was re-watching and compared to that this is a masterpiece this is one of the best songs they've done compared to the sinnoh rap oh boy that song is bad i had two i think they're two wraps it was bad i think it i think it was obvious that if they changed the theme nothing was going to pass nothing was going to surpass the journeys theme no journey's harsh today is an outstanding song this is good it's just you know it's not up to that level but i urge you people if you do not like the song go listen to the sinnoh wrap opening and then revisit this with newly awakened eyes uh what what did they say here uh a journey starts today uh a new journey starts today as ashen goes adventure across the vast wonderful world pokemon continues the first 12 episodes of the 24th season is now uh on netflix continuing the adventure ashko began uh as research fellows for the cerise laboratory in vermilion city as ash continues rising through the ranks of the pokemon world coronation series go continues his quest to catch every pokemon including the elusive mew they gain new friends face old rivals embrace new opportunities to meet catch and study pokemon additional episodes will be available in january and march really they're only going to give 12 episodes so january jeez well we're towards the end of the year yeah if you watch one a week that's 12 weeks yeah i guess uh 12 episodes is 12 weeks if you watch one a week space them out don't don't gobble your anime steve good luck on that i'm very good at not watching anime i you didn't tell me that there was pokemon journeys the series bingo you you buried the lead here we're moving on wha we are not moving on this is outstanding we could have been doing bingo this entire time we could have been doing bingo yeah look if you go to pokemon.com click the journeys button and then scroll to the bottom and you can click the bingo button you can print yourself out some bingo sheets with amazing spaces like train ride ash and go eat pokemon hug each other plane travel good speaking of anime also pokemon.com cheer for the champion in pokemon evolutions on pokemon tv and youtube the first episode of the pokemon's new limited animated series offers a glaring adventure focused on champion leon take part of take part in evolution there was no evolving in this episode i just want to say that take part in the evolution of pokemon's animated storytelling with the first episode of evolutions titled the champion episode 1 offers fans a fresh perspective on what goes in the heart of a pokemon champion as leon prepares to face the greatest challenge of all what goes through his mind doubt regret determination we it literally just spoiled the whole episode right there watch the champion to find out there's there's elements of things that you already saw if you played the game and watch the anime keep an eye out for new episodes which are releasing every two weeks bringing a viewer on a journey of spanning the vast wonderful pokemon world of pokemon so in preparation for this you'll all be amazed i re-watched the entirety of the forgotten by you guys twilight wings which uh is in a very similar style of anime and also covers uh a leon's journey in some way what do you mean forgotten i mean last week we haven't seen an anime like this since pokemon generations and i'm like twilight wings was just last year and it was kind of the same concept it was the same concept but like not the anime style no it's a very similar style yeah watch it watch it again it's a very similar style when i thought this one was like this one i like they turned up the anime jojo bazaar's adventures button to like 17. i i did a reaction video to this on youtube if you want to see my reaction in real time to this episode but i don't like the way leon looks in in this episode sad you don't like manly like chiseled yeah he's more angular in the lines artistic choices were made yeah yes it's very jojo's bizarre adventure but it's very anime the real issue which will probably never be answered for me is we all know where galar is why do all these people not have british accents it's like wait wait wait we just don't have british people in this world that was translated for well i don't play that game watch cartoons they have british accents if you watch the uk version and why does hop sound like he's about 27 years old because he's had that pack a day habit in both twilight wings and this one he just sounds like a like approaching middle age uh yeah well you're right they did do twilight wings when i was thinking of evolutions i was thinking of generations where it was like we need to hit every region and tell a story i guess i feel for like okay so i liked it spoiler but also for 10 minutes i feel like nothing happened charizard gave him a hug yeah it was 10 minutes of getting to a good hug um i sort of agree that nothing new happened like things happened and it felt a little weird i'm like why are we watching this again i think this is the third time in anime form we have seen this scene i guess we've not we haven't seen the scene of like leon backstage before the match that's the new part um true i mean and i sort of feel like it says that the thing that i didn't like about it is it sort of implied that he went into your big match completely distracted i know take it away from my hand will you downtrodden and i did not like adding that aspect to my win like oh i'm not getting leon at his best i'm getting leon who is broken doubting himself and doubting himself i did not care for that spin pre-added eternity leon did not need any charizard hugs to get out there and perform i i i did see somebody say on the comment actually the comments on that youtube video to everyone who commented on the youtube video super super nice and a really good discussion which is amazing for a youtube video um but somebody brought up that throughout the game leon talks about how he needs to protect gallery and that's what a champion does and so when he's laying there and he sees that you're doing it and not him he's like come to accept that he doesn't have to like but he doesn't accept it he's like he's sad about it he's like i couldn't deal with the one yeah i'm supposed to do what what meaning has my life any longer what i don't like is i feel like it showed him giving up before your battle like he was going out onto the field fully aware that no here's where i lose because i couldn't do this yeah i already know will's better than me so why i mean if half half the people who playing the video game were using eternitis that they just caught of course you're gonna lose he just watched you catch a legendary pokemon that you're gonna he the game does i don't know if we talked about this the game does acknowledge like leon will say something if you throw out eternitis oh really yeah so if you're in that final battle in the game and you throw out eternitis he'll actually say like oh of course you brought what's it like to cheat cheater i was just like hi dangerous pokemon go in box now uh yeah no i i box it too but yeah he does he does say something if you bring out alternatives which is like a really nice touch um we need the we need now in like two years we need the episode of the this episode of whether he did purposely want to lose give it up yeah i i feel like that i did not like the fact that i felt like they heavily implied that he was he was he knew he was walking out to not win after winning the entire time i i didn't i didn't care for that like i get being downtrodden and then like being needed to be cheered up for like a half a second but like the entire episode was him being sad and then he barely perks up when charizard's like let's hug it out yeah it's just i like the episode i thought it was beautifully done i just felt like that through line sort of tainted the the experience i had with the games i don't think it didn't it didn't ruin it for me i just i just don't like the way he looks it's just very manly chiseled no it's not even super dude if i'm like window shopping animes and that's what the main character looks like um not passing moving next one yeah moving to the next one okay speaking of anime pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle comes to netflix on october 8th here it is yeah watch as ash encounters the mythical pokemon zarud and get your own dad as a rude and shiny celebi in your pokemon sword and shield game you can watch the latest trailer right now to celebrate the release of the film you will also receive dad as a rude and shiny celebi if the pokemon company decides to email you you can try to subscribe you can toggle the button but sometimes you'll just not randomly get the email and then you'll email into the rep and you'll say hey i didn't get this email and they'll be like well you needed to click this button and you're like i literally got four emails from you this morning and three emails from you the next day and this was the one email i didn't get and they'll go well we don't sometimes email doesn't work and you're like your system is bad i didn't get half of these promotional pokemon because what is happening over there get will anderson on it he's an expert in marketing mass emails here's the donut i get i a million percent understand why they want your email it's still a powerful tool in today's day and age to have somebody's email i get it even though like twitter exists and walking into gamestop that's a thing and toys r us i get it you want the email understand drives new signups that's why you keep doing it but if somebody doesn't get the email and they write into you through support.pokemon.com and they say hey i didn't get the thing and you're going to give me some rigmarole about how i don't have a box check just give me the code i signed up for your website just why are we arguing just send the code we all know your system is bad i'm so mad still still still that i i i did have four emails with them before they gave me my zera aura code and they were like well and i provided screenshots i was like i have gotten every single email from you guys for eight months and not this one i didn't not this one i have it on every time i see dada zarud i keep expecting zuri to be way more avant-garde than it is because i think of the art movement and not what they are clearly meaning it which is a father pic yes so whatever they say that is a root i'm like it's his face askew he's gonna come out and pour water on the audience what's the plan here in this new animated venture a troop of mythical pokemon uh a troop of mythic mythical pokemons the rude oh yeah because you don't plural it's like uh weird uh they live deep within the forest of oak uh okay where they maintain a strict rule that forbids outsiders from entering the territory i've seen this trope before elsewhere in the jungle lives coco a human boy raised by a lone zarood who left the troop coco has never has grown up never doubting that he is a rude but one day a chance meeting with ash and pikachu leaves coco with his human friend is coco truly a pokemon or is he in fact a human question mark i don't know you made it enough to figure out throw up yeah ball at him yeah staffer doesn't capture him in a pokeball yes or no if it don't work human if it do work ultrabeast or pokemon i mean made a tcg card about them ultra beasts are pokemon greg uh when in when danger threatens the jungle the bond between pokemon and humans and the love between a parent and child will be put to the test if you sign up for the newsletter by september 25th you'll receive two unique codes that you can redeem and sword or shield uh one is the pink cape wearing zarud and the other is shiny celebi make sure to subscribe to the newsletter and get ready to tune in to the netflix on october 8th to see what unfolds in the pokemon movie secrets of the jungle i had better get this email last i have two emails upon which i get the newsletters and last time they did a code i didn't get one on either of them and now people are like saying oh well you have to open them all and make sure you read them so that their system knows that you're really literally and i'm like i read every single one yeah yeah yeah same i have pokemon emails vip'd and apple mail it means i have a little star it means they rise to the top so i can see them sometimes i scroll down and i copy and paste the tcg they could that they redeemed and now somebody's listening they're like oh they send tcg clothes yeah they do because i read them all mr pokemon pikachu get you on the phone i read everyone sometimes you send free tcg cards to me and i redeem them in ptcgo oh my i'm so bad about this email thing and it hasn't even happened yet you haven't even been denied yet it's like the badoof thing where you got the bidoof though i i did i didn't get the badoof email how did you get the bidoof card uh shout out to ampharos who sent me one oh on twitter oh i was like a pokemon sent you a pokemon card they on the doofday they sent emails to people saying do you want this be doof card you have to like verify you have to like say that you're interested i never got that email i never got that email and bob we got that email well because bobby because bobby spends five million dollars they're gonna i am confident i spend more money than bobby on pokemon center dot com not in pokemon go because that's a scam game bobby has an uncle named m bezel over at the pokemon company who hooks him up with all the good stuff yeah janine was on to embezzle and that's why janine got fired now they can't access the calendar anymore and then they they sent out b doof codes right and then people on twitter were like i got my b doof code and then i was like i didn't get my bidoof code because i never got the email to sign up for the video it was all sad and then then i then i kind of forgot about it i was like whatever and then a week later they were like somebody was the twitter was like uh we're getting more bidoof codes and then i tweeted hey if anyone has a b doof code and they don't plan on using it because you know not every pokemon fan cares about tcg or the the catch was you when you get the code for b doof you have to spend 20 or more to even get the card that's how they get you so i i tweeted that like i never i like hey if anyone got the code so shout out taya first they got me but then somebody was like this is not the final wave and i was like well i i'm pretty sure they work for the pokemon company but they don't say in their profile they were like this isn't the final wave and i was like well i never got the initial email to sign up with and then they said well you we you don't need that initial email we're sending it to everyone on the newsletter i was like where's to this day i don't have that email i have every pokemon i'm so mad i have kept every pokemon email i get so much i can go i can go we can just go through it this is not going to be the episode no we are not going through your emails no i i'll make it stop it is simple number one get me just like get me the the url for one of the links with the link tracking stuff in it so if they don't want to tell me then i can figure it out that way but pokemon company contact will anderson are using marketing cloud are you using acoustic i can help you i am an expert in these technologies maybe they're on mailchimp they are not on we're done with mailchimp yeah chimp does not do intelligent campaign management i just named two products that are the top of the field when were you ever on mailchimp always i'm still on mailchimp why why do you trust chimps with your mail you don't remember the great mailchimp ads during cereal yeah that's the secret i do advertise on podcasts and he thought he was going to get them as an advertiser no this is this is no joke when i started ise 11 years ago and i was building an email list with squarespace and all that stuff i was using mailchimp i've used mailchimp for 11 plus years it's been fine fine is that what we're going for now for what he did better mailchimp is fine yeah i'm not running pokemon tpci levels of contact management customer relations management management you need a sophisticated campaign management tool do i need to put my phone number mr pokemon call me i'm good at campaign management it's one of my few skills phew [Laughter] it's there though i have it 8 27 fly with sword shield evolving skies 8 18 pokemon presents

that yet here we are but now greg this is something you missed because it used to be a lot more common in the past people really really like it when he reads lists i don't understand you know who's who you know who's you know who's excited listening to the show right now nobody the person that has all of these emails but didn't get that code that's me that's me and i'm not excited by this i am bored at this this is boring all of these people probably have just made 17 emails accounts to sign up and the pokemon company thinks that this is working that oh look at all we get all these new email signups no you're getting all these fake accounts because people are scared to miss there's a rude code well they're not fake accounts because they're gonna get checked i should actually add the pokemon list to my other two accounts that i have i just again if people just don't get the email and somebody just writes into customer service being like hey i never got the email just give them the code no because they could be cheating to try to sell that extra code on ebay for seven point five million dollars there's a strict control add that to the marketing management campaign management tracking to see who redeemed the code and who didn't so that's sorry you don't fit our technology move on peasant begone peasant all right we're gonna take a break i think we're done with all the pokemon news anime news oh oh wait oh we didn't talk about well hold on we didn't talk about the trailer we were so into the we'll talk about the trailer when we get back like trailer which trailer there was a trailer for the movie yeah we'll talk about the trailer when we get back and we'll do the rest of the news we will be right back hit him with the earthquake here we go chad one more time [Music] there it is three we got through confusion spam all three earthquakes zen the one with the final blow [Music] here are some ribbons i need to save the game asap [Music] quick and we are back from our break i tweeted this [Laughter] but you tweeted your displeasure with the zeroed voice but i i i just i saw the roots swinging i'm like yep that's a rude and then all of a sudden he opened his mouth and i was like he's talking sometimes pokemon talk in these things a lot of times pokemon talk and these things i think every pokemon that has been featured has talked to these things i am i did the thing where i also read the twitter thread of this tweet and it was all these people tweeting that the power of us was good oh no we cannot and i was like i was like i'd rather deal with a national dexter right now than you deal with somebody who thinks the power of us was a decent movie look the power of us has great animation it looks beautiful that story is worse than a curious george book hey curious charge books aren't bad they're very good and yes it's like you're the man in the yellow hat [Laughter] where i should get a yellow hat uh yeah i mean like i can't help but think this is just like a tarzan clone but i mean it is i mean it is clearly a tarzan clone yes like it's it's that in the center this is are rude is raising hey what's up we are sort of ignoring that they already did this plotline with the kangaskhan kid yeah gosh that was such a good episode his name was tommy by the way because the dad dropped him out of the helicopter yes okay we've already been here this is just an ex a further exploration of the tarzan phenomenon with zarud this time which happens more frequently than people would expect parents losing their child children in the jungle and their children the apes are going to start a union soon complaining about all the daycare that they have to provide [Laughter] so they did an event in pokemon go for cello for secrets of the jungle that was on december 3rd 2020 which was jesse and james and shiny celebi if we remember this true i do remember um easy way that was like no money no early access no tickets everyone got shiny celebi pretty much for free the story line was pretty easy i think you had to do like three or four team rocket and then you had to battle jesse and james and there you go they did tweet there's no official blog post about this yet but the official pokemon go twitter uh twitter account to tweet get ready trainers a special event celebrating the global release of pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle is coming soon keep your eyes peeled which cool that makes sense uh they don't say what this event will be but pokemongohub.net points out a bunch of pokemon featured in the trailer um so they're saying that it could be any of these pokemon so they got pikachu flag on flapple flapple not in the game uh munchlax nuzleaf drillburn whooper blossom pangoro crustal squivet hoot hoot we do it let's love it uh well i mean maybe they're wrong maybe it was agreed uh ninjask petal stunky wobble fat haircross cherubi butterfree vileplume roserade combi and cramerant this this is this is the moment right we're all thinking the same thing no they're usually wrong about that what do you think i'm thinking this is when kramer ant comes to pokemon go nope oh no yeah no they'll [Laughter] it'll be up in there i mean they'll get to it eventually yeah um the only thing i the only thing that might be weird about them maybe not doing kramer does that feel like they would have to also do ericudo at the same time why what do jessie and james have an arakuda no they have a cramer kramer is very featured in this movie yeah because jesse and james have a cramer ant yeah therefore kramer ant is valid there has to be at least one point in the movie ericudo is shown why because it's just ability it just munches pikachu the entire time yeah no exactly so it's like the entire movie he's less than 50 percent hp yeah yes he's yes it's it's only crammer jessie and james violence of course it's less than 50 percent hp you know why well kramer could put a lot of things in its mouth that's not just one fish in the entire universe camera does put a lot of things in its mouth i think this is i think this is it i think kramer ants come into pokemon go i mean you're wishful thinking they have hoopa they're they're they need no more excuses i don't understand speaking of hoopa i was working on that special research this morning and i finished like it said one of five i finished one of five and all of a sudden it turned into two of 16. yeah yeah scammed i want my money back no no well first off you didn't pay any money i'm incensed i bought incenses i'm pretty sure one of the quests gave you an incense for free well i used that one foolishly and i had to buy more i'm i'm i'm all in on crime rat i mean you've always been all in on camera this is nothing but th this uh what else would you do that it's an area of squabbits glove it's in the movie squabbits and pogo now yeah and make it shiny yeah probably but uh they introduced flapple everybody loves what we want the cram no we want flapple you want the crayons my mlg team is the minneapolis the the mini flapples miniflapolis miniflapolis because we are known as the mini apple some other pokemon go news here uh from uh saturday october 9th from 11 to five duskov will be more frequently available in the wild if you're lucky you might encounter in a shiny one evolve dust clops dusco's evolution during the event for up

community special research story nothing dull about dusko that's a pretty good name actually shout out to everybody except duskull hey that's cool is cool i like duskull it's kind of like you also get chloe but it looks like two eyes you get three times the catch stardust uh incense will last three hours large mod modules will last three hours look it only took them five years ghost pokemon don't feel like i feel like they're finally listening this is the next slide don't criticize them great does go fantastic good job good theming you know i didn't i forgot about this until i saw people complaining but duskol was dusko was one of the first shiny pokemon in the game and i i forgot about this i feel like you go out of your way to look for people complaining i i don't they come to me i stream six hours a day i believe that i do believe that you need to ban them i i will oh gosh again you can just go on twitter people want litwick um i you either get a ghost or a you get a pokemon that moves the game forward flip a coin take a pic it should have been pumpkaboo yeah maybe but look they still have time right like i don't i i would i i'm gonna speak for niantic maybe i don't think niantic plans on this game ending in the next year or the next two years like they want this game to last forever or as long as they can there's 800 pokemon we've had how many repeat communities two three we've had charmander and we had well those roses where they throw everything at you kind of count as well and we had evie so we've we've had a couple repeats well there wasn't a rosalie community before that community today oh there wasn't no oh there was the um it wasn't like a community it was like the uh it had been shiny for a while but there was like but it was increased odds because of the safari zone that's why you remember no it was the it was the european safari zone it was before that weekend rosella was shining for everyone or could increase the problem with community not the problem maybe x maybe expectations are the problem people i feel like people want starters or people want like gable level pokemon but we're like halfway through the pokedex like like yes there are still more pokemon coming up like we can still do chespin fennekin uh the other one frookie that's three and then so we have nine starters left right yeah gen six gen seven gen eight so that's not even a year of communion days and then just assuming that each of those games have two pseudo legendaries that's six so we're at 15 pokemon that's that's not even two years of content so yeah i totally i get it just goes like a like i like duskill as a pokemon so that's why i'm excited like i i like that evolutionary line it's really good for people who um play competitive for vgc i mean that's a very small market but like dusklops is one of the best vgc pokemon um so if you wanted just a shiny dust collapse it's like very good for that but if you think about it in the sense of like okay we have maybe let's be generous we have we have 12 pseudo legendaries left and we have nine starters left what's filling in that gap dust skulls but like you have to have other pokemon like fill it in like you could be like well okay it's feel okay this feel is not good competitively i don't think they could give it any sense of competitive move to make it good it'll be a new was tossed in there yeah but piloswine was super good for like it is the best ice type attacker for raids like it is it is super dominant i think the real issue is that they've seen that people aren't spending money on community days but now that they've done like we're doing monthly community days people expect there to be a community day so now it's like well let's see what we can grab out of the trash bin they're not going to spend money on it anyways toss it out there i mean december is always ketchup isn't it now isn't that the past yeah december's always catch up so really i have 11 months that you have to fail yeah i i i no there was it was uh i think it was a starter i think it was snivy oh that sounds familiar or ted pig because oshawa what's the last one right yes yeah yeah yeah but if you think about it in the sense of like we're almost out starters we're almost out of pseudo legendaries you're gonna have i don't want to call them duds like i don't think duskul is a dud of a pokemon like i don't have it i'm excited for it marie was really exciting for a lot of people because because marie was artificially rare in pogo like it's the same thing with litwick like i guess if you only play pogo and you're like wow it looks so rare yeah but like play black and white there's a whole tower dedicated you can 100 lit wick every four steps you're getting a lit wick like but those shiny ads are bad i i don't know i don't know i don't want to say like this is niantic's fault that people are upset that it's a dust skull and not a litwick because i feel like they will eventually do litwick oh absolutely why would that be niantic's fault because niantic artificial i don't know like because niantic artificially made litwick rare and so therefore people want litwick i don't know they've made a lot of things artificially rare i will point out that rosalia's are not spotting up here for this autumn event and i'm mad about it i'm not going to write to niantic and say you messed up your hemispheres because it is autumnal at this point i like these are the complaints that muddy the waters when real issues come up yeah like you're right the issue that you don't want dust gold because duskill has been shining for a long time isn't a particularly compelling reason and it undercuts when there is a very compelling reason because you just sound like you yell at everything and this is not a great like you know that at some point like it will probably come it is on a time million percent litwick is going to be a community you know this is going to happen it could happen next year for all we know when you decide to fight these things with the same fever pitch as things like the distance things that were actually life affecting it completely undercuts you as a reliable source and i really wish people would look at like is this a battle that is actually worth fighting and saying that we don't want a shiny dust call are the people who were upset that we're having a shiny rosalia day like this is not a good battle to fight like this isn't even a good reason yeah i think like i think you said it really well greg like i just some community days are going to be awesome and some are not they're all awesome like for you it's not just you if the reason comes down that i already have this your reason is just purely selfish i already have shiny discal and i've had it for a long time so therefore i should get a different pokemon that is a selfish selfish reason and you really need to rethink why you want that yeah i'm not disagreeing with you i know pvp wise i don't think shadowball was the best i think um some smart pvp people maybe suggested counter would have been a better move but i don't i don't want to discredit the pvp just because i don't play it those people know what is good and what's not good and i'm sure for them if the community is doesn't hit the pvp mark it's like well what's the point of even grinding out the specific pokemon so i get it um you get your time back and you don't spend a dollar but let's be real they're gonna grind out anyways because three-time stardust and they're pvp people yeah i don't think you can say you spend a nice day with a book uh yeah i think the the only thing that twitter complaints really did was remind me that duskol was one of the very first shiny pokemon i kind of forgot about that because it was like mad it was pikachu first then it was magikarp and then i think it was duskull because pikachu was like the spring magikarp was the summer and then it was like duskill and stabilized i think were the first two something like that yeah yeah uh anyways i don't know i'm excited i like to call his pokemon i think he's cool i think it also kind of i don't know maybe it's a stretch but they give you center stones dust noir is exclusive like debuted in sinnoh it's cl like i i would maybe besides the whole like hey niantic you finally figured out ghosts in october it's also lead up to the games yeah i would i would maybe guess i would assume oh actually i don't know what they're going to do you know it wouldn't surprise me if they would be like hey we're doing the gen 4 starters all for community or shanks shanks would be a good one but shanks was shiny and raids already yeah i'm sure that would be the complaint that would be the shakes would be i don't have a shiny sinks i would love a shiny sink i had you know i've probably done tiger boy 30 to 40 raids for shinx most of those were with my free raid passes because you just walk down the walk one block over do it for free easy enough um i had to shine shakes i traded it to zoe two dots when i met her at pax because she she was looking for a lucky one or something but i don't know i think shanks would be a good one i'm trying to think uh if they haven't had a starly shiny community we've not had starley starly would be pretty good too see but starley would be said no one ever please starling would be in the situation of like new shiny but probably not good competitively at all so i mean raptor is amazing it's a raptor made out of star raptor is amazing said no one ever i would prefer shanks over starly i i would like shanks yeah i would like your shanks also be an electric dark type but i don't get everything that i want well i wouldn't have made it any much better well you don't know that i do love really bad competitively dark type ain't saving it we don't know what different choices could have been made if they had gone electric dark type we don't know the union arrives to the tcg uh is this the thing that the 18 cards go together to form voltron yeah exodia shows up sweet each each pokemon v union has four separate cards that combine to a larger card all four parts of the cards have the same name so using the example above you can only have a total of four youtube v union cards in your deck if you all have all four parts of the v union in the discard pile you can put them into play to assemble a larger pokemon v union once in play treat it like a normal pokemon takes up one spot of your bench you can also have pokemon tools attached to it um one also very big all four parts of a specific venue in your deck must be part of the same illustration it goes on to say how they work but they're coming english they just showed the english when they're coming later this is coming english now they're not going to be in booster packs though which was the concern a couple of months ago when we talked about this uh in japan they weren't in booster packs either you usually just had to buy like it was like three booster packs and then like this uh these four cards so how'd they do on the meta uh i don't know i think one of them is specifically good might be the zashian one all right we saved the best news for last week what what what what is it pokemon and oreo limited edition it's about time they weren't at my cub and i cried uh they come out on uh they ship on monday tomorrow or the day this episode goes up discover this is off oreo.com finally been waiting 11 years to read something off oreo.com on this program okay before we get into it did you

mistaken we thought that the little uh pokemon on the mini snack packs were all they were doing they kept they kept it secret they did did good spoiler season they were just like tight littered not a single whisper that they were going to prank i will say awesome guess what you're gonna find out folks if you're one of my favorite people my favorite people were the people who were in august and were saying where are the pokemon oreos because i was like i'm pretty sure we said they come out in september friends do you think they kept it a secret because all nabisco employees are on strike right now oh yes oh no it's it is no one was there to like lead it is a bit of a line crossing to go buy these products right now because nabisco is not doing good is it nabisco owned by a cigarette company what what no or nabisco owns a cigarette company i mean that may be tobacco alteria brands owns a number of things they have yes i like that pokemon nabisco stands for national biscuit company true they so in the trailer they their own foods no they're bought somebody else bought them didn't they craft craft owned them for a while uh in the trailer they had like this pokemon mural or whatever um which is a real mural that you can like go to i think it's in los angeles i think i think so because it showed up a bunch in my uh it's um in my instagram feed a bunch of people buy this cool thing and i'm like oh venice beach lost it i don't know where that is venice beach on the ocean it's on the ocean it's where my cousin lived well have them snap a picture they don't live there past tense oh my mistake man this trailer is so good it is really good i mean are we flying out to venice beach so what do we got on these cookies they kind of like spoiled them all we got piplup snivy squirtle jigglypuffs uh what what is that charmander uh raleigh what is that one called the charmanders tartwig uh dratini grooky pikachu uh cyndaquil bulbasaur lapras pancham sablai wait there's a pancham yeah where i mean it's in the cookies on the cookie website i'm i'm looking uh shanshu and mew i don't see no pancham it just flashed by i'm looking secret rare i also don't understand having rarities in in the cook you're going to eat the cookie anyways yeah but because you gotta get you got to find the mew and then you gotta send it to psa and they gotta give it a nine out of ten you gotta slack it and put it on your wall yeah i mean pancham is on the back of the packaging too pancham is in there i well i'm looking at all 16. i see no pancham where are you looking at all 16 because you're clearly wrong i'm looking at a nintendo enthusiast there's no power oh there you go they didn't get the pancham here you here that's like the here the uh krispy kremes where they're like pokemon dozen pokemon donut box and it's five pokemon repeat in six regular christmas group go to oreo.com pokemon and watch oh i see the patreon channel an intended enthusiast failing in journals okay but do you see the picture i'm looking at here which maybe i'm just blind that's possible my eyesight is going bad which one on this is pancham wow this is a tiny bad picture oh maybe i confused pancham it looked like a tart wig to me maybe that's the paint jam yeah i think that the one that's way off to the side it looks like a tert wig but i think that's the panchi oh yeah that's probably the pain it's real this picture is bad yeah it's it's pretty low res here's the problem with oreos nothing they are good cookie they are an amazing cookie the fork strategy is terrible very good it is the problem with oreos is their price and the packaging stays the same but there's less oreos every time you buy it fewer oreos yes they like do some magic on the inside where they like usually like i feel like 10 years ago when i opened an oreo package i was like 40 oreos and then five years ago it was like 35 oreos and now i feel like when i open oreos it's like 10. oh yeah there's only 10 in there i think you are thinking that the packaging has stays the same size it has not it has shrunk and that is how the world goes we are our oreo supply has been lowering for years oreos there's not many oreos left in the wild uh and they don't breed well in captivity true true and they had to do so much inbreeding to make all the variant oreos like oreo is just an endangered species period so be happy with what you get and stop thinking you deserve it's amazing they don't crumble in your fingers the second you pull them out and then there's a bunch of fools out there that dirty dishes by stabbing them pointlessly with a fork uh oreo did reach out there sending me some oreos are they're sending us some marios did you make your email accessible on your twitter account yes uh i don't know how they found me i just assume it's the email my twitter account i have no clue how they find me they emailed me like a month ago and they said we're we're we want to send you a package and i said okay and then i give my address and then they emailed me a week ago and they said your package is on the way i didn't sign any ndas so uh i don't know i don't want to burn the bridge with the oreo company i'm already burning bridges with other people question of the week already well i mean we we ended up you said you had seven tabs open that was pogo movie tv show all right oreo tz all right fine something else question of the week submitted for you and i it's not a phoebe bridger's song i told you i don't know if you'd be british well that's a you problem not a problem probably phoebe i know is from that show friends smelly cat then let's go like smelly cat i can do smelly cat this is from lewis who is your favorite npc in the pokemon universe are they talking about gamer anime cause i'm gonna say aj with the sand shrew uh i mean anime y is nando because nando is outstanding but npc stands for non-player character so that pretty much limits it to the actual games okay yes uh it's not youngster joey it's not todd because todd's annoying ah it's not so good he calls too much he calls when there are deals and if there happens to be a bunch of deals he's gonna let you know [Music] he calls for no re he calls to say hey my my rattata battled again like no we're gonna let that thing evolve no he doesn't know how that's why todd is the worst mine's easy but very specific pokemon veteran in the gen 5 games there you go that i tried to replicate that style it's not easy to do but heart break charles that's that but you hate triple battles but he is the perfect villain heartbreak charles is right because he's made battles because he we he knows everyone hates triple battles so he forces you to do it he's like a heel in wrestling you can't help but hate him but you hate him so much you love them do we count like gym leaders and trial leaders npcs they're non-player characters yeah but heartbreak charles for pokemon masters move aside i'm going i am going to go with mirror b because mirror b is one of the greatest characters of all time i'm going with heartbreak charles harvey charles mirror b and gen five veteran sold all right that is a really good style i could yeah could you can you get i even had a tangle with a little stripe yeah to try to get that i wonder what happens it's really good oh i think i got ruined on an airplane oh i wasn't ready uh i i didn't pull up the youtube question of the week the youtube question of the week is what is will knitting the answer a blanket a blankie is he knitting out for either steve no i don't make for children very rarely it is a blanket for adults uh that that was that was a question one episode it was what was will knitting so it now you guys know it's a blanket blanket uh this is a good one patman writes in on our youtube if you want to have our question answered uh leave a youtube comment i don't know hit the subscribe button too click like subscribe bell ring a ling ling bell yeah yeah yeah uh what is the most amount of money you've spent on pokemon at one time or over a period oh boy ah maybe over a period and maybe your single most expensive pokemon i mean i bought the fossil 10-year anniversary watch which i think was a 120 at the time wait was that pokemon center no no it's fossil fossil watches did a 10-year anniversary pikachu watch i thought they did a 20-year anniversary and you could get off pokemon they did or something but they also did a 10-year and i have it and then the battery died so i just have to watch you can replace the battery yeah but then i stopped wearing it seven battery watch things in a mall that's all the mall is at this point but i got a different watch i got this watch that i can customize oh yeah there's no pokemon watch faces for the apple friend the over a year what was the biggest year for pokemon games because i bought all of them that year and they were all like 40 each so well you're you have one of the most expensive pokemon items ever which is english pokemon box oh yeah yeah which is actually legit on a thousand dollar game i know it's i found it opened yeah oh sealed it's yeah i have it it's a black lotus but i mean i didn't spend a thousand dollars to get it at the time like is this we're talking about money spent i think on one purchase i spent 100 i think the watch was the most expensive thing at 120 bucks i can't think of anything more expensive that i've purchased huh because how much are those master ball replicas master ball was 120 but the other ones were 100. yeah so so i gosh now they i bought the ultra ball what about so i have literally spent 400 in metal pokeballs which which the me opening the youtube is so weird i got the metal pokeball right or i got the metal pokeball in the metal grape metal master ball and i was like i'm going to open these in 30 seconds and i'm gonna do like fast cuts or whatever because i like what i saw on tiktok was like just people opening like mechanical keyboard stuff and they did like fast cut of like slicing the box fast cut of like whatever pulling it out you've seen like tic toc unboxings they're like really quick and i was like oh i'll do this with the pokeball whatever didn't think anything of it i put i i did it with pokeball and i did with the master ball i put them on tik tok they got like 2 000 views or whatever you know some tick tocks do well some don't i put that pokeball same video just copy and pasted it put it on instagram reels almost a million views on both of them on reels and i was like what is happening right now people are bored and then i was like well might as well put it on youtube shorts so i put that in pokeball master ball on youtube shorts and after like two weeks it had like three thousand views and i was like i don't know why this didn't do well on tick tock i mean it almost has a million views on reels and then a month later just randomly it went from 3 000 views to a million views and now as of this recording which is only a month after this it's over four million views there's nothing like it took a while for the algorithm to get to you yeah was like the only thing i've learned is that everyone just assumes that it's plastic and i've wasted my money [Laughter] i haven't done a luxury ball and i refuse the amount of assumptions people have in a 29 second video is out like like like you have thought more about my 29 second pokeball video than it took me to record and post this video like where your mind has gone about who i am as a person what i have done with my money how much i have in my 401k and what kind of material this is you have all put way too much thought to leave a negative youtube comment which is fine you're only boosting the algorithm more by leaving your negative comment but what that's called heck yeah that's called a rent-free living but i have spent now 400 on metal pokemons all right i'm i'm this question has actually now made me sad and unhappy because in thinking about it the most i ever spent on pokemon was when i bought two copies of tropical beach oh my gosh i was gonna say this for somebody who i was dating now when i bought those i think they were 130 each so that both of them cost me 260. i just looked on tcgplayer for how much a single tropical beach costs the lowest price is four hundred and thirty three dollars the real ancient mew yeah that's real that's real that's what that is and i could have used a tropical beach nobody was buying me a tropical beach yesterday why didn't you buy willa tropical do you put that on your uh tinder will i will buy you a tropical by tropical beach no that's how you get the guys at that what's that what's that one dating app with the uh the prompts i think that's hinge maybe uh hinge is the one where you have to respond to something that somebody posted like a photo or one of their things so yeah that's probably the one you're thinking of yeah like i think i think it's like i i don't i look i haven't dated anyone in 11 years i haven't dated somebody in 28. uh what is hinge it's just a thinking app yeah i think the thing it has is like it forces you to answer something because like people don't know what to put so like you have to have a series like you have photos it tells you like put this kind of a photo and then it has like respond to this question but you could you could change the question if you wanted to yes but the thing is like somebody can't directly send me a message saying hi will your beautiful eyes because you know i haven't heard that 50 000 times let's get creative kids they i will you have terrible eyes they offend me deeply and say like the make comment on the photo or if i say i like to play pokemon and card fight vanguard then they have to respond to that statement they can't just reach out to me directly based on my profile uh so i think one of the most popular hinged ones is like tell two truths and a lie and so on a lot of things yeah so then yeah look i only know that this because tick tock is also built on an acclaimed nobel prize winning algorithm okay so i feel like that's not true so with expensive things i also bought two tropical beaches i had a uh staff promo tropical tropical beach which was i think i paid 130 for it and it just said staff on it um and it was given out to people who were staff members at worlds or nationals they got it for free some people sold that obviously and then i had a top 16 tropical beach which again was somebody who placed top 16. now the interesting thing about that is it didn't matter if you played the vgc or the tcg you got a top 16 no matter what so i would safely assume that if you were a tcg player you kept the tropical beach because it was one of the best cards you could have in a deck and i would assume that the vgc players were like i'm never going to do this let me sell it pretty easy 100 to 200 and i did the same thing as well did is well i sold my tropical beaches to a friend and then realized that they dramatically went up in price and now they're gonna be top 16 worlds 12 tropical beach is as low as eight hundred and forty eight dollars i guess they're still good in expanded format huh yeah they're still really good are there two tropical beaches or is there a little beach it's been 10 years there are two different beaches there are two different tropical beaches um but they do they the art is different but they do exactly the same thing oh i see this as listed as worlds 11 and this is listed as world's 12. yep yeah one has like a ted pig on it and then one doesn't auschwitz navy and a psyduck in the swimming pool and then it's pikachu with the elemental monkeys which is clearly the inferior one you want worlds 11. definitely i think i had the monkey one uh so for the question was what's the most amount of money you've spent on pokemon for tcg cards that was the most i've never spent over a hundred dollars on a call what a single card in tropical beach was i bought two for a deck uh i can't fathom spending that much money on that card like i couldn't bring myself to spend over ten dollars on a magic card like what does everything like i don't really need that i spent like 185 on a magic card i know you did i spent 250 on the skateboard all right you bought the skateboard bought the skateboard um do you spend a lot of money how well i can open them up on tick-tock [Laughter] and make no money all of those salty people on my on my youtube if i would have said would you spend a hundred dollars to get four million views on a youtube video i bet they would say yes well because youtube you're you're monetized you know what's funny is youtube shorts cannot be monetized i have made you've made zero money so no i would not spend a hundred dollars to get four billion views on something that doesn't make me money it gets you subscribers though which i've probably gotten 5 000 subscribers from that video alone and ideally you would hope or want those subscribers to watch your other stuff convert into views yeah yeah i don't know whether they're converting any views if you're a subscriber that watch this short and convert it into a view leave a comment below if you discovered my discovery 100 metal pokeball in 29 seconds leave a comment and now we're listening to this podcast please let us know if you think will has beautiful eyes comment below i do truth in um everybody fails my two truths and a lot i have spent 99 on a complete inbox copy of platinum used uh which i think now is because of the pandemic has probably gone up to like 200 bucks uh they just put some commemorative coins on pokemon center this weekend that was 129 i purchased that wha what is it what coming it's like franklin mint i know but why why why because i i look at the room he is sitting look at this disaster i'm putting it on pokemon you have any rules of bts toilet paper greg of course i'm going to waste money on commemorative coins dump that and don't put it in the movement shuttle but these coins are kind of cute oh no they're not i take it back ah buy that i buy things so then i tell other people not to buy them that is awful well we're talking about it now in the show so maybe it's not that awful there you go pretty bad dragonite eve navy lounge pants oh there are some of them oh i got to get some of them tights i'm i'm into the tight life now how are you yeah i have a tick tock for you no no tights on me not tights on other people i know but i have a tic tac for you oh dear uh i have purchased all of those pikachu year with funko that was 12 times 15. what's the math on that i need to come up with some product that you're very into so that i can just take all your money from you oh you know you know what's not the most expensive thing i bought but my favorite thing i've bought was when i was in japan they at the same time they released a pikachu wedding collection with different pikachu wedding things and my wife and i we went to six different pokemon centers and we finally found it at like the fourth one we went to and there's there's these pikachu um champagne flutes and i think it was like there's a song about those 7 000 yen which is about 60 um and they only had two left and we got one and so um that's probably my favorite pokemon item i have and we bring those out uh on our anniversary uh but they just have like little like they have like a pikachu and a suit and then like pichu and a wedding dress uh they don't make them anymore i'm sure they're really hard to find and or and or no one cares because like the kind of very specific target market yeah it's for weddings yeah so um that's probably my favorite thing there's not like there's not like a single pokemon item that seems very expensive unless you're talking about like a specific game like pokemon box obviously um maybe like pikachu nintendo 64. i would assume probably is kind of expensive i would guess well i actually i purchased i purchased the pokemon specific switches i think that's probably the most expensive thing i purchased oh yeah like 200 bucks i would imagine right now a sealed copy of heart gold soul silver with pokey walker that's gonna that's gonna run you some cash yeah i mean i have this giant be out that was this was a gift though but that was 300 yikes well look how big he is i don't like stuffed animals what it's a body pillow no it's on the floor why don't you have the gigantic piplup because i don't have that kind of money i'm buying commemorative coins well i haven't have neither of you purchased me the yamper getting this booty chomped on by diltec i couldn't finish that set that's i i buy greg so many lovely gifts for his birthdays and yet it's still not enough it's never going to be enough learn this i want everything i am never satisfied just like yeah neither greg or i have a tropical beach from will for greg's birthday i bought him a handcrafted handcrafted precious gemstone set of d dice cause that dude loves role playing games like you wouldn't believe and yet it still wasn't a yamper with a joltik biting it on the butt so it's not good enough are you kidding me they're prominently displayed behind me i see nothing but books keyboard keyboards [Laughter] there you go in the bag not a disgrace i take them places and use them i even spent this is this is how bad it is i spent years i'm like greg which of the which of those do you like i remember you talking to me about this because i am a thoughtful human being you are uh speaking of thoughtful pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon started out i made a commentary about the fact that in galler the fossil pokemon don't evolve even though there's still four fossil pokemon available in the gala region uh and then i did a twist i made it tcg relevant yeah so i didn't say the wrong one i said it's a you got to pick up on the the key points that it's a basic v so it's a v pokemon there's fewer of those and they also say it's a basic uh has two attacks and the first is if it's attack if the defending is a v or gx then it prevents that pokemon from attacking during the opponent's next turn and then this pokemon second attack does a lot of damage but then it can attack during its next turn but then you keep in mind that the cannot attack clause is you can work around it if you're able to somehow retreat the active pokemon and then make it active again and i mentioned blastoise keldeo because keldeo had the russian skill which allowed you to retreat your active pokemon without actually actually retreating it so then you could retreat the kill deal with a float stone and put your active pokemon active again love the float stone is that still is it still legal it's just there's something out there there's like a skateboard or something dumb yeah i think it was i think it was a skateboard actually so there you go do it because i've got the wrong one so you have to say it it's geodude i say the wrong one you say the right one you don't even know how to do this is your own show we've done like five million episodes and you played victini with the victory piece i know and victory is a fire pokemon i actually wrote i actually wrote down draco fish you're close it's arctivish okay i don't know anything about the tcg steve you said you knew this one because of the tcg yeah i mean victini is very good in the tcg but let's set the clues i just wanted the same thing big teeny is very good in the tcg yeah maybe it is now that wasn't when i was pushing that guy hard well it wasn't kind of it was like a more victini one victory piece and a thousand fire energies no you had to use victini to let you flip again no that's flip teeny that guy got rotated out yeah he's gone so which one is it velozolt arctivish oh arctivish to be fair i don't think i've ever looked at the arto vish tcg card i just basically read the entirety of it to you uh arctivist shares its category with aerodactyl dracovish arctovish arto zolt and draco fish they're all known as the fossil pokemon um arctovish dracozolt arc zolt and dracovish are the only fossil pokemon not to be rock or have a gender arcto fish along with the other gallerian fossils were designed by hitoshi aryaga uh in the anime keralis is the person who gives arcto vish its species name okay what did what does this designer do oh this is the um this is the enkei malamar pangaro mega bee drill alolan geodude guy for these that weird black and white grayscale stuff i like it i like that they're all like grayscale because they're not complete they're wrong she's so careless that careless i like these fossils a lot i wish they had done something where you could make them into what they're actually supposed to be because it bothers me it's boring that when they you put them together correct it's just it'll be like the the next region will have the actual form is it's these fossils but the way they're supposed to be i mean there's a lot of great artists that have put them together the right way and some of those look really good yeah but most of them just look boring what do you mean either way it looks like dinosaur are you ready for this week's pokemon ready all right i don't want complaints about how i'm butchering anything with this so ohio gozaimasu in today's episode of japanese chori we are discussing preparation of the delicious parshen parshen should always be plucked fresh from the mizu and if uncooked seasoned and served on koori be sure to check for a padru in the sheru before serving itadakimasu [Laughter] that's pretty much it wait you don't know itadakimasu nah how rude how would you even eat a single meal my favorite memory in japan was sitting with andrew andrew who listens to the show yes who's got the cutest most adorable twins in the entire universe his his kids are absolutely adorable and we were he was like i'm going to teach you the one thing that'll that'll work for you everywhere in japan and it was sumimasen and he was like he's like you're american and americans are so happy so that's how you can remember the first part sue me sumimasen which it just means like it means excuse me or sorry or you just say it everywhere it is it literally works in every situation i'm sorry to bother you he's correct i'm really sorry because i'm american you are just sorry for existing well here's the thing if you're if you're getting ready to eat in japan you don't have to put your hands together although that is a common thing and then you just say it it's just a courtesy before you eat but we we went so we when i met andrew we were at the um uh kyoto pokemon center that's a phoebe butcher's song no sorry we were at the osaka one osaka pokemons what do you want from me yes okay okay connected to the mall and so we were like well let's eat in the mall food court and and so it's me andrew irene and andrew is not japanese by the way he's from new zealand correct he's a kiwi he's he's lived he's lived in japan for what 15. a very long time 15 almost 20 years probably a very long time very long time a chunk of the life and so we're we when you go to the restaurant it's like some uh like they have a bunch of different kind of curry and we had probably the most japanese stereotypical waiter that is like like the the one that you see in an anime that like i hate american stereotypes and you could just tell that he was not happy that we were his table and like the look on his face his pot like his posture like every body language being like i do not want to serve these people and then andrew busts out this fluent japanese to the guy and he like just changed his well yeah it's like when we go out to eat with you and we've actually happened to find a restaurant that you like we are prepped for the worst experiences of our life and we are pleased as punch when you're like oh i found like four things on this menu i eat this is a 100 true story but i was out on my bike this morning i wasn't doing my normal route i was i took my bike just to go around southdale and i noticed that there's a like freestanding shake shack and the literal thought that came to my head was oh if i ever have to go out to dinner with steve we can go to shake shack it's true well that's the end of our show
