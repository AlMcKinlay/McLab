rereading a wrinkle in time which i (2:26 - 2:31)
think i haven't read so i was 12 years (2:29 - 2:33)
old and it is certainly a diff (2:31 - 2:35)
book when you're an adult reading it and (2:33 - 2:37)
is it different good because I also (2:35 - 2:39)
think i read it when i was around 12 oh (2:37 - 2:42)
I'm loving it absolutely but it's like (2:39 - 2:45)
you pick up on things that the iris like (2:42 - 2:48)
totally it didn't even pass my (2:45 - 2:51)
comprehension when I was very young and (2:48 - 2:53)
reading it it's like when you watch (2:51 - 2:54)
movie when you're younger and then you (2:53 - 2:56)
pretty watch it again and you're like oh (2:54 - 2:59)
look at all these sexual references I (2:56 - 3:00)
had never picked up as a kid you know (2:59 - 3:04)

because there's this whole thing right i (3:04 - 3:08)
don't know if anybody remembers or as if (3:06 - 3:10)

weather all of a sudden it's actually (4:41 - 4:46)
more may was like in the 50s Fahrenheit (4:43 - 4:49)
today and yesterday and friday out of (4:46 - 4:51)
nowhere because it's februari in (4:49 - 4:52)
michigan and that's not supposed to (4:51 - 4:55)
happen so I mean everyone and that I've (4:52 - 4:58)
seen around this area is like losing (4:55 - 5:03)
their minds with how warm it is I was (4:58 - 5:05)
actually really concerned about you this (5:03 - 5:08)
morning Travis was as well because the (5:05 - 5:10)
first thing I do in the morning is turn (5:08 - 5:12)
on the news and the first thing that was (5:10 - 5:14)
on the news was about a really horrible (5:12 - 5:16)
thing that happened in Michigan (5:14 - 5:18)
overnight and I was like I don't know if (5:16 - 5:20)
that's anywhere near where Travis lives (5:18 - 5:22)
or not yea I'm guessing it's so horrible (5:20 - 5:24)
that we wouldn't want to talk about it (5:22 - 5:25)
on the show but program that I don't (5:24 - 5:27)
know what you're referring to you should (5:25 - 5:29)
tell me what that is after this I can (5:27 - 5:31)
know if I should watch out for anything (5:29 - 5:34)
if i should like all right well Steve (5:31 - 5:36)
can edit this if he feels like it he (5:34 - 5:40)
yeah I'll probably cut that up you (5:36 - 5:42)
should leave in just yeah I'll probably (5:40 - 5:48)
get that out man uh well let's see (5:42 - 5:50)
what's what's new here because we're not (5:48 - 5:51)
allowed to talk about pokemon for (5:50 - 5:54)
another minute and a half there's a joke (5:51 - 5:57)
in there somewhere so if you're active (5:54 - 5:59)
on the slack community or follow me on (5:57 - 6:01)
Twitter I've gotten pretty into Final (5:59 - 6:06)
Fantasy 14 which is on ps4 ps3 and pc (6:01 - 6:08)
and by the time you're listening to this (6:06 - 6:11)
the mac version should be available and (6:08 - 6:13)
you can cross play with everyone in (6:11 - 6:16)
every council and yeah that's really (6:13 - 6:18)
cool and if you are interested in (6:16 - 6:21)
getting to a getting into a fairly easy (6:18 - 6:24)
MMO our guild the it's super effective (6:21 - 6:28)
guild is recruiting new members and and (6:24 - 6:31)
if anyone knows me and when I get into a (6:28 - 6:34)
game i get i get deep into a game so I (6:31 - 6:37)
don't think with the destiny drought (6:34 - 6:42)
that I used to cling to have moved over (6:37 - 6:43)
to Final Fantasy for now and having a (6:42 - 6:46)
good time with it so you're interested (6:43 - 6:48)
in that and you have questions you can (6:46 - 6:51)
tweet at me or select me and I will fill (6:48 - 6:55)
you in about that otherwise of trying to (6:51 - 6:58)
write ours there are speaking of CAC (6:55 - 7:00)
cars we are on the server k (6:58 - 7:03)
oh wow well then I mean I have no reason (7:00 - 7:05)
not to because characters are like my (7:03 - 7:08)
favorite thing Hector is really cool um (7:05 - 7:11)
yeah photo coblos Coco Bianco's is so (7:08 - 7:14)
much cooler than chocobos yeah although (7:11 - 7:16)
you can feed your chocobos fruit and (7:14 - 7:18)
change the color of their feathers by (7:16 - 7:21)
what kind of fruit you feed them here is (7:18 - 7:23)
an actual conversation I tell my hair (7:21 - 7:25)
works here's how an actual conversation (7:23 - 7:27)
I have with Steve Steve are you writing (7:25 - 7:30)
a chocobo Steve responds no I have a (7:27 - 7:36)
unicorn yeah man I had a unicorn I'm (7:30 - 7:38)
real cool I play a healer and final (7:36 - 7:41)
fantasy 14 I really like its first time (7:38 - 7:44)
I've ever played a healer in an MMO good (7:41 - 7:47)
time oh speaking of MMO and final (7:44 - 7:50)
fantasy 14 this kind of relates to what (7:47 - 7:52)
we're going to be doing in in about a (7:50 - 7:56)
week Travis and I as as well as three (7:52 - 7:59)
other individuals will be doing a (7:56 - 8:02)
Pokemon d and these names cannot be so (7:59 - 8:03)
because they're in the witness (8:02 - 8:08)
protection program I mean I could rattle (8:03 - 8:13)
off names but unless good we're gonna be (8:08 - 8:18)
doing a I so when I say Pokemon DD what (8:13 - 8:21)
I really mean is D&D and I don't know (8:18 - 8:25)
what percentage of Pokemon equals that (8:21 - 8:28)
because you will not be dungeon (8:25 - 8:31)
mastering this game we're correct yes I (8:28 - 8:34)
will not be the DM or that is it diem or (8:31 - 8:38)
GM for Dungeons and Dragons it is DM for (8:34 - 8:40)
every other game because they cannot get (8:38 - 8:43)
because DM i think is a trademarked (8:40 - 8:45)
thing all the other games say GM game (8:43 - 8:49)
master okay but DM is Dungeon Master (8:45 - 8:53)
correct okay so we will be doing a X (8:49 - 8:55)
amount of I don't know how many weeks (8:53 - 8:58)
but it think of it like a TV show for (8:55 - 8:59)
two hours every week we're going to be (8:58 - 9:03)
doing some D&D on Twitch if you cannot (8:59 - 9:05)
see it on Twitch we will be recording (9:03 - 9:07)
the audio version and putting it up as (9:05 - 9:09)
part of a podcast it will probably be a (9:07 - 9:12)
separate podcast not too bogged down the (9:09 - 9:13)
eat super effective feed (9:12 - 9:15)
and the will still be doing our weekly (9:13 - 9:18)
it's super effective but let me pull up (9:15 - 9:20)
a calendar real quick just so i can get (9:18 - 9:23)
you guys dates first episode which will (9:20 - 9:25)
be us creating our characters will be on (9:23 - 9:28)
februari 29th then the next episode will (9:25 - 9:31)

fifteenth March 22nd March 29th we're (9:38 - 9:42)
just doing the first two episodes on (9:41 - 9:44)
Monday and then we're going to switch to (9:42 - 9:46)
tuesday for everyone because that's (9:44 - 9:47)
going to work better in the long run on (9:46 - 9:48)
everyone's schedule if we switch to (9:47 - 9:51)
tuesday first two episodes or monday (9:48 - 9:53)
just so we can start them get them out (9:51 - 9:57)
there and i've never played D&D before (9:53 - 9:59)
Travis is very experienced yeah played a (9:57 - 10:03)
lot of D&D still has no interest but you (9:59 - 10:05)
can at least hang out with us in the (10:03 - 10:07)
twitch chat will will has better things (10:05 - 10:10)
to do hahaha no i mean i'll probably be (10:07 - 10:13)
up in there making rude comments about (10:10 - 10:16)
your ridiculousness what if you have to (10:13 - 10:17)
be there because otherwise you wouldn't (10:16 - 10:19)
know if one of us named just named our (10:17 - 10:22)
character will and was just like the (10:19 - 10:24)
entire time making fun of you that's (10:22 - 10:27)
fine i think most people do that anyways (10:24 - 10:30)
play deity and the other characters will (10:27 - 10:32)
yep indicting then make fun of me the (10:30 - 10:34)
whole time no that's how I operate (10:32 - 10:36)
that's how I live my life in that firm (10:34 - 10:38)
belief that the rest of the world is (10:36 - 10:40)
making fun of me constantly oh that's (10:38 - 10:44)
not true while we're on this subject her (10:40 - 10:47)
for a little we should say that Greg (10:44 - 10:50)
who's gonna DM for us has home-brewed (10:47 - 10:54)
has has customized the game so that (10:50 - 10:57)
pokemon are involved in the world of (10:54 - 11:00)
dungeons and dragon i'ts so yes even I (10:57 - 11:01)
really have no idea what we're getting (11:00 - 11:03)
into but it should be super mystery (11:01 - 11:06)
dungeons and dragon i'ts that's really (11:03 - 11:08)
good that's actually really good what's (11:06 - 11:12)
funny about that is greg was one of the (11:08 - 11:15)
probably so greg was on as one of the (11:12 - 11:17)
kickstarter backers now that i say that (11:15 - 11:20)
were one case I'd her back er still has (11:17 - 11:22)
yet to be on though I just remembered (11:20 - 11:24)
that now but he was one of the most (11:22 - 11:26)
requested to come back just (11:24 - 11:29)
because somehow his rapport was very (11:26 - 11:33)
well liked and so somehow somehow say (11:29 - 11:38)
that like I somehow you upstaged me and (11:33 - 11:41)
people enjoyed his presence uh but uh (11:38 - 11:44)
well I mean there's a certain like (11:41 - 11:47)
misguided portion of our population that (11:44 - 11:49)
thinks Roselia and roserade is a quality (11:47 - 11:52)
Pokemon versus the actual garbage that (11:49 - 11:56)
should be taken out so there you go Greg (11:52 - 12:00)
fans Greg grothe what it would a script (11:56 - 12:04)
play a campaign campaign that's so weird (12:00 - 12:08)
Greg wrote the campaign last last fall (12:04 - 12:10)
so it's been done for a while I know (12:08 - 12:12)
he's put a lot of time and effort into (12:10 - 12:15)
it so I this isn't something that was a (12:12 - 12:16)
rush thing this is actually something (12:15 - 12:18)
we've been planning for a while and most (12:16 - 12:21)
the delays were just on my end so very (12:18 - 12:23)
excited to start it and hopefully you (12:21 - 12:25)
guys enjoy it and like I said earlier (12:23 - 12:27)
it's going to be broken down into think (12:25 - 12:30)
of it like a TV show so it'll come to an (12:27 - 12:32)
end with a season will start a second (12:30 - 12:35)
season if if at all it's popular and it (12:32 - 12:36)
catches on and then in that second (12:35 - 12:38)
season we could introduce maybe a new (12:36 - 12:41)
character maybe Travis gets hit by bus (12:38 - 12:43)
in real life and he can't be there so we (12:41 - 12:46)
we write his character out we had this (12:43 - 12:47)
got real grim and then we bring somebody (12:46 - 12:52)
else in edit that out give us a lot of (12:47 - 12:55)
dark references in this episode Wow (12:52 - 12:58)
total possibilities for other things if (12:55 - 13:00)
if it's popular and that would be up to (12:58 - 13:02)
our listeners if they want to watch or (13:00 - 13:04)
be invest in that and again I'll stress (13:02 - 13:07)
I've never done any of this before if (13:04 - 13:10)
you are not into D&D I am in the same (13:07 - 13:12)
boat as you and maybe that's that's (13:10 - 13:14)
something we can we can learn together (13:12 - 13:17)
if you care to watch oh let's say only (13:14 - 13:19)

last year was the first year they (16:11 - 16:14)
experimented with it now they its (16:12 - 16:18)
regional Nationals worlds hmm I did not (16:14 - 16:21)
yeah because I am there I think they're (16:18 - 16:23)
ramping it up more because they have (16:21 - 16:26)
Kyle working for them on the inside now (16:23 - 16:29)
and he goes out and post the streams and (16:26 - 16:32)
and the jwittz mm-hmm both of them team (16:29 - 16:35)
up and provide their commentaries so I (16:32 - 16:36)
think that they're kind of building out (16:35 - 16:40)
that arm of the organization yeah it is (16:36 - 16:43)
yeah it I it is what it is i looked up (16:40 - 16:45)
pokemon com i didn't see any like final (16:43 - 16:47)
results so we'll probably report on the (16:45 - 16:50)
next week if if there's something (16:47 - 16:52)
interesting there the other thing that (16:50 - 16:54)
recently ended is pokémon red burst open (16:52 - 16:59)
blue happened in splatoon as a flat fest (16:54 - 17:01)
and i think it was red and blue in every (16:59 - 17:03)
country except in Japan it was red (17:01 - 17:07)
versus green correct and the results (17:03 - 17:11)
came in this morning pokemon red across (17:07 - 17:13)
worldwide was the more popular team in (17:11 - 17:17)
every what incorrect nope listen and (17:13 - 17:20)
edit your statement listen pokemon red (17:17 - 17:22)
was the more popular team in every (17:20 - 17:25)
country except they lost in every (17:22 - 17:27)
country to pokemon blue and put my green (17:25 - 17:29)
well how does that work because more (17:27 - 17:33)
people picked pokemon red but pokemon (17:29 - 17:37)
blue one more games it's ugly suit shows (17:33 - 17:41)
pokemon blue wow I didn't know splat (17:37 - 17:46)
fest was so complex that it's two stats (17:41 - 17:48)
well did you think splat fest was just (17:46 - 17:52)
that uh that Oh original we channel (17:48 - 17:55)
where you voted on things everyone chill (17:52 - 18:02)

things yup and then like he's like bet (18:08 - 18:14)
on him too I wonder if they're gonna put (18:11 - 18:16)
that to me tomo they'll probably be a (18:14 - 18:19)
voting thing in me toma but yeah pokemon (18:16 - 18:22)
pokemon red uh in every country was more (18:19 - 18:24)
popular but pokemon blue and green one (18:22 - 18:29)
every single country so the skilled (18:24 - 18:31)
players were not the charizard pickers (18:29 - 18:35)
but i thought of that listen is that one (18:31 - 18:37)
can say Charizard school but you're just (18:35 - 18:40)
gonna lose that was a cool thing that (18:37 - 18:44)
Nintendo and Pokemon did and hopefully I (18:40 - 18:47)

marketing executive of nintendo saying (21:25 - 21:29)
if you have fighting game skills and (21:27 - 21:31)
love all things pokemon but never had a (21:29 - 21:33)
chance to combine the two the pokin (21:31 - 21:36)
tournament early access competition is (21:33 - 21:38)
your chance to show off your skills i (21:36 - 21:42)
like that that statement conjures the (21:38 - 21:45)
image of someone who's sitting home at (21:42 - 21:48)
home and they have street fighter to (21:45 - 21:51)
ultra mega whatever because i'm not like (21:48 - 21:52)

fighter four when it first came out when (22:38 - 22:42)
like I feel like Street Fighter was very (22:40 - 22:44)
very hyped up when for came out I was (22:42 - 22:47)
super excited I got it played a couple (22:44 - 22:49)
games I was like looking at the move (22:47 - 22:50)
list going man this is really (22:49 - 22:52)
frustrating like it's very hard to learn (22:50 - 22:54)
learning curve his way up there played (22:52 - 22:56)
some online games completely got (22:54 - 22:58)
demolished never played street fighter (22:56 - 23:01)
four again cuz way too competitive and (22:58 - 23:03)
it sits at a very high skill level and (23:01 - 23:06)
then street fighter 5 came out just like (23:03 - 23:08)
last week and I was like man on street (23:06 - 23:10)
fighter 5 so bad because I like fighting (23:08 - 23:12)
him but I have no one to play with and I (23:10 - 23:14)

fighter 4 and my ego and I don't I just (23:14 - 23:21)

fighter has like I want a fighting game (23:23 - 23:27)
and poking is real close so I'll just (23:25 - 23:29)

any of the conventions were gonna go to (23:42 - 23:48)
oh that was conventions like mgc and (23:43 - 23:50)
stuff yeah actually we could talk about (23:48 - 23:52)
mgc real quick so uh midwest gaming (23:50 - 23:55)
classic is in april in brookfield (23:52 - 23:58)
wisconsin it is a show that I've been (23:55 - 24:00)
going to this will be I could leave my (23:58 - 24:04)
six-year there they offered me a space (24:00 - 24:07)
upstairs normally i'm downstairs in a (24:04 - 24:11)
pretty big room i would say but the last (24:07 - 24:12)
two years we shared that room with (24:11 - 24:14)
nintendo nintendo asked if they could (24:12 - 24:16)
share the space with us we were like (24:14 - 24:19)
yeah definitely and and they were great (24:16 - 24:23)
guys but nintendo has a lot of things to (24:19 - 24:25)
give away and a lot of people want those (24:23 - 24:27)
giveaways and the room filled up (24:25 - 24:30)
extremely quickly and it was very hard (24:27 - 24:32)
to move around and I got very hot and I (24:30 - 24:35)
think we both both us and Nintendo (24:32 - 24:37)
agreed that this worked (24:35 - 24:39)
and would continue working if we got a (24:37 - 24:41)
bigger room but there are no it was a (24:39 - 24:43)
mutual decision right right there were (24:41 - 24:46)
no bigger rooms available so instead we (24:43 - 24:49)
took we both took smaller rooms but (24:46 - 24:53)
separate this is how divorce works oh (24:49 - 24:56)
hey cut that out yeah we'll just cut (24:53 - 24:59)
that up grim grim episode so what we're (24:56 - 25:00)
gonna be upstairs it's really exciting (24:59 - 25:03)
and it's gonna be a smaller room but the (25:00 - 25:07)
organizer was like hey pokin is going to (25:03 - 25:10)
be probably pretty popular this year are (25:07 - 25:11)

if i want to do a tournament the (25:16 - 25:20)
tournament for no prizes by the way (25:19 - 25:22)
because that is technically against the (25:20 - 25:26)
laws in milwaukee county and that's a (25:22 - 25:28)
whole nother story but i do have a (25:26 - 25:30)
friend that i could borrow with you from (25:28 - 25:31)
i would probably have to go out and (25:30 - 25:33)
purchase another copy of poke in but it (25:31 - 25:35)

pokin though the question was asked is (26:42 - 26:50)
pokin coming to 3ds really and the (26:45 - 26:53)
answer is probably not oh yes that (26:50 - 26:57)
question I game spot okay okay not to be (26:53 - 27:00)
confused with games so a reputable cyl (26:57 - 27:03)
both whole video game company if you (27:00 - 27:04)
were hoping the upcoming pokin (27:03 - 27:06)
tournament would be eventually be (27:04 - 27:07)
released on three dias you better sit (27:06 - 27:09)
down it's not very likely that the (27:07 - 27:10)
fighting game will be making its way to (27:09 - 27:13)
the Nintendo handheld gamespot (27:10 - 27:16)
interviewed a few Japanese people with (27:13 - 27:18)
very complicated names about pokemon (27:16 - 27:20)
tournament and asked if there were any (27:18 - 27:22)
considerations bringing through the S (27:20 - 27:24)
it's definitely a challenge to get it on (27:22 - 27:27)
Wii U with what we were doing right now (27:24 - 27:28)
and it's definitely would be a challenge (27:27 - 27:31)
to have the same graphical experience on (27:28 - 27:34)
3ds Hodari said that it's less about (27:31 - 27:36)
technology and more about needing the (27:34 - 27:38)
money to do it a programmer doesn't need (27:36 - 27:40)
technology a programmer needs a budget (27:38 - 27:43)
Adara said laughing poking tournament (27:40 - 27:46)

good quote isn't it yeah so yeah pretty (27:57 - 28:05)
much was like I feel like it was pretty (28:03 - 28:06)
much like we would do it if they gave us (28:05 - 28:09)

Oh a theme evo card okay p.m. a book do (32:01 - 32:06)

article that there were no more planned (32:09 - 32:14)
characters but I don't have I cannot (32:11 - 32:15)
confirm or deny that because i don't (32:14 - 32:18)
have thee I don't know when or where I (32:15 - 32:20)
read that but i thought i did i would (32:18 - 32:24)
really unhappy i can't play as a sunkern (32:20 - 32:24)
yeah I don't I would imagine that adding (32:26 - 32:32)
a character would be a bit complicated (32:28 - 32:36)
just in terms of balance and my hash for (32:32 - 32:40)
us yeah yeah I hope that it's good i'm (32:36 - 32:42)
excited for it i hope that they do (32:40 - 32:46)
update it if you no charge Charizard has (32:42 - 32:48)
a flamethrower that's just 0 overpowered (32:46 - 32:50)
I hope that there's an update that says (32:48 - 32:52)
like charizard flamethrower has been (32:50 - 32:54)
reduced by point zero five percent to (32:52 - 32:55)
balance the game that'd be really cool (32:54 - 32:59)
just charizard charizard are already (32:55 - 33:01)
calling for Eddie up hashtag nerf chairs (32:59 - 33:04)

the future with the here's the thing (35:19 - 35:24)
andrew is already multiple times told us (35:20 - 35:26)
how to pronounce I guess all of those (35:24 - 35:29)
things but that does not mean that any (35:26 - 35:32)
of the three of us have the memory to do (35:29 - 35:34)
it hey I think I got hiroshima pretty (35:32 - 35:38)
good no yeah it's the emphasis is on the (35:34 - 35:41)
oprah i think the o's are more like AWS (35:38 - 35:45)
so it's more like Hiroshima hmm like (35:41 - 35:48)
that and like Fukuoka will be back next (35:45 - 35:52)
week with proper Japanese cuz anything (35:48 - 35:53)
what I'm saying what I'm saying here is (35:52 - 35:56)
that Andrew has already taken the time (35:53 - 35:59)
to make videos of himself pronouncing (35:56 - 36:00)
these things correctly and I just feel (35:59 - 36:05)
bad that were but he doesn't get (36:00 - 36:08)
anything out of it I mean we're trying (36:05 - 36:15)
trap uh speaking of pronouncing things (36:08 - 36:22)
wrong yeah you sure yes I'm sure uh so (36:15 - 36:28)
the new pokemon mikania ya thank ya got (36:22 - 36:31)
an actual English name which i butchered (36:28 - 36:38)
last week and was corrected I don't have (36:31 - 36:39)
that name in front of you but i believe (36:38 - 36:45)
it's migire nah yes and obviously I and (36:39 - 36:47)
I said last week that I know I'm getting (36:45 - 36:50)
it wrong but and I was explaining to (36:47 - 36:54)
will because I saw mage ma GE and I (36:50 - 36:56)
didn't see gear and I was trying to (36:54 - 36:59)
think of like why did I miss that am i (36:56 - 37:02)
that dumb but then I'm looking at the (36:59 - 37:04)
Japanese name and i can say that very (37:02 - 37:07)
easily magana and then i was like oh ma (37:04 - 37:11)
g meg that's why i saw major 800 the (37:07 - 37:14)
japanese name is Maggie onna oh you know (37:11 - 37:21)
that's enough whatever the weather i say (37:14 - 37:23)
McGee near or ma guiana it still starts (37:21 - 37:27)
with mog that's true can argue with that (37:23 - 37:30)
Marjorie nuh so they really miss my but (37:27 - 37:35)
the butter pokemon it's not but arena so (37:30 - 37:38)
migire na is what were what we're going (37:35 - 37:41)
with right yeah look I would say I mean (37:38 - 37:44)
it is it is weird right how it's spelled (37:41 - 37:46)
mcgeer nuh (37:44 - 37:49)
it is certainly migire now but it's yes (37:46 - 37:51)
it is i'm i am on your side steve and (37:49 - 37:54)
that it is a weirdly it's hard to suss (37:51 - 37:57)
out how to pronounce it unless you think (37:54 - 38:01)
oh it's cuz it has gears yeah i just (37:57 - 38:06)
it's just it's shocking that we've come (38:01 - 38:08)
seven hundred and some pokemon later and (38:06 - 38:10)
we're still getting separate japanese (38:08 - 38:13)
and english names and Victini is a good (38:10 - 38:15)
example of a Pokemon name that is (38:13 - 38:20)
universal so you just look at magee nia (38:15 - 38:23)
or however you said that will well and (38:20 - 38:25)
like that look like an appropriate (38:23 - 38:30)
english name like that seem fine but but (38:25 - 38:34)
we wouldn't really get (38:30 - 38:36)
in English we would because they're all (38:34 - 38:37)
supposed to be puns and we wouldn't (38:36 - 38:40)
really get the pun there yeah that's (38:37 - 38:42)
true I mean it we don't really want (38:40 - 38:46)
Pikachu either but um I mean we get the (38:42 - 38:48)
pika and we get to chew am I missing (38:46 - 38:51)
something what what what pun in English (38:48 - 38:55)
this isn't it just like isn't like true (38:51 - 38:59)
the sound for in Japanese that might (38:55 - 39:02)
make and pika is like shine or something (38:59 - 39:06)
what I might be making it all up but (39:02 - 39:11)
Andrew less Andrew Hiller let us know (39:06 - 39:14)
Travis what are your thoughts of migire (39:11 - 39:16)
nah I think you already talked about it (39:14 - 39:19)
in the last one but it sure looks a lot (39:16 - 39:22)
like diancie but I think it's cool I (39:19 - 39:27)
mean I'm a fan of like clockwork things (39:22 - 39:31)
my d bunkie if they go steampunk fan no (39:27 - 39:36)
I draw the line okay I like I like (39:31 - 39:40)
clockwork robots I am indeed campaign (39:36 - 39:43)
right now centers around a bunch of (39:40 - 39:45)
clockwork robots there's no goggles (39:43 - 39:49)
there's no airships well let me ask you (39:45 - 39:53)

Spacely sprockets and their enemy (40:27 - 40:32)

that is happening cuz I'm dead let's (40:47 - 40:55)
let's rewind better eat oh um rewind a (40:49 - 40:59)
bit here I what was under the impression (40:55 - 41:02)
that this was going to be a pokémon (40:59 - 41:06)
related to Deon say mega dance a (41:02 - 41:09)
breakdancing Dion say but then I (41:06 - 41:14)
remembered by the way diancie had a (41:09 - 41:16)
great profession to the Super Bowl yeah (41:14 - 41:20)
yeah I agree Oh her to her new song is (41:16 - 41:22)
straight fire straight fire a fire it's (41:20 - 41:24)
pretty red but then I remember Pokemon (41:22 - 41:27)
does dumb things like Tauros and (41:24 - 41:32)
bouffalant and Luvdisc and aloha mora (41:27 - 41:36)
alum imola hello no it's a low mamola (41:32 - 41:41)
because it's a palindrome yellow mamola (41:36 - 41:46)
so mole I'm sure they'll have some deep (41:41 - 41:50)
lure explaining how so-and-so Pokemon (41:46 - 41:53)
and probably saw an image of Deeanne say (41:50 - 41:57)
and was like I want to build migire nuh (41:53 - 42:00)
but they will be completely unrelated (41:57 - 42:02)
but that's that'll be the connection (42:00 - 42:04)
because you can't not look at this new (42:02 - 42:08)
Pokemon and go what's what's the like uh (42:04 - 42:12)
game theory TM 10 things you didn't know (42:08 - 42:16)
about pokemon the you strength to move (42:12 - 42:18)
the truck to find Mew isn't there (42:16 - 42:19)
something about that with Jenna sack (42:18 - 42:21)
that gems like people think that (42:19 - 42:24)
genesect is like fossils like Kabhi tops (42:21 - 42:27)
or something oh yeah yeah wait do you (42:24 - 42:29)
want to know what is the pseudo Laura (42:27 - 42:32)
around migire nuh yeah sure that in (42:29 - 42:35)
omega ruby and alpha sapphire one of the (42:32 - 42:37)
evil teams was talking about project (42:35 - 42:40)
Azoth and Azoth is the city that (42:37 - 42:43)
volcania takes ash to in the upcoming (42:40 - 42:45)
movie where migire now will be revealed (42:43 - 42:49)
and you know mahira is a human-made (42:45 - 42:55)
pokemon mm-hmm and the pseudo lore is (42:49 - 42:58)
that AZ from the x and y games was (42:55 - 43:02)
founder of Azoff noticing how his name (42:58 - 43:05)
is repeated in there and he created (43:02 - 43:09)
magana to show his floette that he had (43:05 - 43:12)
regained his ability to love Pokemon it (43:09 - 43:14)
all comes full circle people do you (43:12 - 43:16)
steal what I posted in Slyke about that (43:14 - 43:20)
yes I'm like trying to Travis asked I'm (43:16 - 43:23)
trying to look for it but I lost it yeah (43:20 - 43:27)
but they were under the what will just (43:23 - 43:29)
said under the assumption that it was (43:27 - 43:32)
with a Z and everything like that I've (43:29 - 43:35)
heard worse things like if you look at (43:32 - 43:36)
magee Rinna's legs they look like they (43:35 - 43:38)
could plug into volcania on so that (43:36 - 43:43)
they're kind of like for mud what is it (43:38 - 43:45)
like some robots like one together like (43:43 - 43:47)
the drive like boat know it's like (43:45 - 43:49)
Voltron and then they form a greater (43:47 - 43:51)
Pokemon by the two of them combining (43:49 - 43:55)
together I'm listening that's all I have (43:51 - 44:00)
to said you had me at Voltron oh not (43:55 - 44:03)
massacre there you go dead silence you (44:00 - 44:04)
guys don't know your combo robots (44:03 - 44:07)
there's a joke in there somewhere let's (44:04 - 44:09)
heart let's ask the hard question here (44:07 - 44:11)
you think this is gonna be a new type or (44:09 - 44:14)
not steel fairy it's easy steel fairy (44:11 - 44:18)
hmm well beam it could be a new type yes (44:14 - 44:21)
undeniably steel fairy what new type is (44:18 - 44:24)
that uh well we got to Travis if you (44:21 - 44:26)
weren't paying attention the last 200 up (44:24 - 44:29)
so if we have moon type now how is that (44:26 - 44:31)
a moon good look the bottom part could (44:29 - 44:33)
easily be a moon it could be a pokeball (44:31 - 44:35)
as somewhat have been saying but it's (44:33 - 44:38)
exactly like a pokemon as a circle or (44:35 - 44:41)
okay go back up my theory of impossible (44:38 - 44:43)
i'm gonna know I'm gonna stop you there (44:41 - 44:46)
but moon type so then by those by the (44:43 - 44:48)
fact that it has a circle on it by those (44:46 - 44:51)
standards electrode Voltorb Geodude (44:48 - 44:53)
those are certainly all moon type (44:51 - 44:57)
Pokemon hey right that has no moon it's (44:53 - 44:59)
flatly steel fair is now a move I'm just (44:57 - 45:05)
saying moon Bert a moon bless anyway the (44:59 - 45:07)
real the real type that it could be is (45:05 - 45:11)
going to somebody so I'm still under the (45:07 - 45:13)
impression that there will be at (45:11 - 45:15)
point a sound type or something that (45:13 - 45:18)
revolves around all the moves that are (45:15 - 45:20)
sound based there's already a thing that (45:18 - 45:22)
revolves around a loser sound basis (45:20 - 45:25)
called sound proof they wouldn't know I (45:22 - 45:29)
don't there's no way i am i am the i am (45:25 - 45:32)
the old curmudgeon there's no way they (45:29 - 45:33)
would introduce a sound type when they (45:32 - 45:35)
have an ability sound proof that would (45:33 - 45:37)
just completely shut no now they (45:35 - 45:39)
couldn't make enough disabilities but (45:37 - 45:41)
somebody was suggesting that there could (45:39 - 45:44)
be a techno type yeah like a mecha type (45:41 - 45:47)
which does lean more towards my sound (45:44 - 45:50)
type and making that sound type of (45:47 - 45:51)
reality because when I said love type (45:50 - 45:53)
they introduced fairy and I was kind of (45:51 - 45:55)
close I knew they weren't going to call (45:53 - 45:57)
it love but fairy is pretty much what as (45:55 - 46:00)
close as they're getting with that so if (45:57 - 46:03)
it was a year else lv stands for love (46:00 - 46:10)
catch all these friendliness pellets i (46:03 - 46:14)
have no idea what to tell refer single (46:10 - 46:16)
listener of the show does i bet you (46:14 - 46:17)
every single listen to the show knows (46:16 - 46:19)
that i was referencing undertale about (46:17 - 46:21)
you know that's fantastic cuz i tried to (46:19 - 46:23)
enter a contest to win a free copy and i (46:21 - 46:26)
didn't so i said screw they seem not (46:23 - 46:30)
interested we all can have your memes (46:26 - 46:33)
all day long cuz i'll just mute you on (46:30 - 46:37)
twitter the first messy it is it 9 I (46:33 - 46:40)
don't care don't that there there are (46:37 - 46:42)
tons of people that are just dying and (46:40 - 46:45)
my sayings impression right now it was (46:42 - 46:47)
pretty good it was pretty good sustains (46:45 - 46:51)
or is isn't it's an SAT since Santa (46:47 - 46:54)
Cyrus stains roll back the tape of my (46:51 - 47:01)
son's house me rolling it back thanks (46:54 - 47:01)
type y'all can play your garbage non (47:01 - 47:06)
pokemon games all day long i'll be (47:03 - 47:08)
playing pokemon with the real people (47:06 - 47:13)
techno type could be a thing I agree so (47:08 - 47:15)
somebody second actually I'll kill you (47:13 - 47:17)
for a little bit what other pokemon fit (47:15 - 47:23)
in techno type I think you would have (47:17 - 47:27)
Magneton no sorry yeah no yes maybe Mike (47:23 - 47:30)
Magneton make that family correct that (47:27 - 47:32)
family yeah my resume Magnezone that's (47:30 - 47:33)
what I was thinking they're already (47:32 - 47:36)
steel electric you take other steel (47:33 - 47:37)
you're taking another steal yeah (47:36 - 47:39)
removing steel turning them into mecca's (47:37 - 47:43)
robbing them of see okay okay i said (47:39 - 47:46)
i'll give her you all hear you (47:43 - 47:46)
what else we got will something that's (47:46 - 47:53)
kind of like a robot the reggies all of (47:50 - 47:56)
them you would resume the reg's stop (47:53 - 47:59)
those are golems house are gonna (47:56 - 48:04)
mechanisms oh that is a spit in the face (47:59 - 48:08)
of Jewish mythology to call a golem a (48:04 - 48:11)
mechanical thing no the Golem is brought (48:08 - 48:14)
to life by the very word of God that is (48:11 - 48:16)
written on its forehead we're all (48:14 - 48:19)
familiar with the goal of mythology I (48:16 - 48:21)
don't think you are if you think is (48:19 - 48:23)
gonna be mech I'm saying I'm changing (48:21 - 48:25)
its types of that story no longer (48:23 - 48:29)
applies Oh Voltorb an electrode yeah (48:25 - 48:32)
which-which our pokemon that uses a lot (48:29 - 48:35)
of sound moves like screech and sonic (48:32 - 48:41)
boom what about the ghost robot from (48:35 - 48:44)
Rotom goer I olark is also just a golem (48:41 - 48:48)
try again nice No golurk strike two (48:44 - 48:52)
golurk was man-made made by human hands (48:48 - 48:56)
o our golems the robot well golurk could (48:52 - 48:58)
easily change type to that and maybe (48:56 - 49:00)
your definition of robot is a little too (48:58 - 49:02)
limiting that a golem couldn't be a (49:00 - 49:05)
robot maybe a goal on their original (49:02 - 49:07)
robots and there are things that are not (49:05 - 49:10)
little but obviously you learned too (49:07 - 49:12)
much in your philosophy courses sir and (49:10 - 49:14)
you need to roll it back a little bit (49:12 - 49:16)
let me it's a tune with the real ghost (49:14 - 49:19)
yeah and in my in my philosophy 302 (49:16 - 49:23)
class the anthology of robot well maybe (49:19 - 49:26)
you're a robot Travis Palace let me tell (49:23 - 49:29)
you it does not compute let me tell you (49:26 - 49:32)
the one Pokemon the one Pokemon family (49:29 - 49:35)
that would benefit the most out of a (49:32 - 49:41)
sound order will shock you the most of a (49:35 - 49:44)
sound or techno type that would be the (49:41 - 49:50)
porygon family yeah sure that's fair ah (49:44 - 49:53)
you could also do like star U star me (49:50 - 49:57)
really yeah cuz they're fan yeah cuz (49:53 - 50:00)
they're like space things yeah I agree (49:57 - 50:04)
your definitions of robot is is hey for (50:00 - 50:06)
grasping at wires there is there can be (50:04 - 50:08)
organic robots there can be spiritual (50:06 - 50:12)
robots don't know wait magenta sex (50:08 - 50:14)
genocide can can go with a techno 28 (50:12 - 50:16)
knows a move called techno blast by (50:14 - 50:20)
those standards how is it every Pokemon (50:16 - 50:23)
not a robot every Pokemon is robot (50:20 - 50:25)
that's why you can put them in the (50:23 - 50:27)
computer i will say that will may mom (50:25 - 50:31)
digital i will say that will made a (50:27 - 50:33)
great great point i think two weeks ago (50:31 - 50:36)
saying that they should give get away (50:33 - 50:39)
from normal type but there is no benefit (50:36 - 50:41)
of a normal you're at a disadvantage of (50:39 - 50:43)
using a normal type pokemon one was a (50:41 - 50:44)
really good defensive type though yeah (50:43 - 50:49)
until my map shows up relax is a great (50:44 - 50:51)
defensive pokemon because it's only week (50:49 - 50:53)
a fighting has the immunity to ghosts no (50:51 - 50:54)
it was a great defensive way it isn't a (50:53 - 50:56)
normal week against ground isn't that (50:54 - 50:59)
the thing no no all right Kari always in (50:56 - 51:01)
his week to ground which is weird to me (50:59 - 51:04)
but don't get that one yeah other (51:01 - 51:07)
arguments of well techno would be too (51:04 - 51:10)
close to steal but ground and rock are (51:07 - 51:12)
close but they're very different and (51:10 - 51:15)
water and ice are close but they are (51:12 - 51:18)
very different bug and poison are close (51:15 - 51:21)
but they're very different true so yeah (51:18 - 51:25)
I'm not saying that migire now couldn't (51:21 - 51:29)
be steel fairy it looks steel fairy but (51:25 - 51:32)
that doesn't rule out a new type and (51:29 - 51:35)
techno or technology first folks I am (51:32 - 51:40)
ruling out a new type as of what is this (51:35 - 51:42)
episode going to come out Steve februari (51:40 - 51:47)
22nd as of februari the 22nd i'm calling (51:42 - 51:50)
it there will be no new type associated (51:47 - 51:53)
with migire nuh but you're not saying no (51:50 - 51:55)
new type altogether well i don't have (51:53 - 51:59)
all the facts you only all i know is i'm (51:55 - 52:01)
seeing this migire nuh and i'm saying (51:59 - 52:05)
that it has that is no way in relation (52:01 - 52:07)
to a new type I can neither confirm nor (52:05 - 52:12)
deny the allegations if there may be a (52:07 - 52:14)
new type in the next game (52:12 - 52:16)
but that theoretical new type will have (52:14 - 52:21)
no relationship to mogera so I ran a (52:16 - 52:24)
Twitter poll asking if people would want (52:21 - 52:26)
a new type fifty-two percent said yes (52:24 - 52:31)
forty-eight percent said no yeah I would (52:26 - 52:33)
love a new type but I would also love (52:31 - 52:35)
more pokemon and pokin tournament I (52:33 - 52:38)
would also like more pokemon games I (52:35 - 52:40)
just want everything so they introduced (52:38 - 52:43)
fairy because dragon-type was perceived (52:40 - 52:45)
to be too strong what would the new type (52:43 - 52:48)
be used to balance what do you think (52:45 - 52:53)
some balance right now Barry I think (52:48 - 52:56)
I think ice is real strong offense (52:53 - 52:58)
lightly ice is really bad defensively (52:56 - 53:01)
though but offensively like everything's (52:58 - 53:05)
using ice be just ice me good not as (53:01 - 53:07)
much anymore now that ferry exists (53:05 - 53:11)
because ice cream is included to combat (53:07 - 53:16)
dragons rockslide is probably the most (53:11 - 53:20)
Opie move ever in doubles yet yeah so (53:16 - 53:22)
rock rock type is too strong I feel like (53:20 - 53:26)
bug Pokemon still are way too weak feel (53:22 - 53:28)
like steel Pokemon our way two weeks to (53:26 - 53:32)
us though besides really sighs or I mean (53:28 - 53:34)
no one's using steelix its gladly you (53:32 - 53:35)
but you have like sighs or you have (53:34 - 53:39)
Heatran you have this is where is four (53:35 - 53:41)
times weak to fire he trained as a like (53:39 - 53:43)
a unique combination though of fire (53:41 - 53:45)
steel you mean getting that anywhere (53:43 - 53:48)
else but so even though steel has like a (53:45 - 53:50)
decent number of weaknesses its (53:48 - 53:52)
resistant to so much that it's pretty (53:50 - 53:54)
good and so many the combinations that (53:52 - 53:56)
it's paired with like what size or and (53:54 - 53:59)
like with you Tran and tell me out what (53:56 - 54:02)
other ones are there um Magneton even (53:59 - 54:06)
even like a magnet own right because one (54:02 - 54:08)
of its primary weaknesses is ground and (54:06 - 54:10)
you can add in like air balloon the fact (54:08 - 54:13)
that there's things like Heatran (54:10 - 54:14)
magnezone that double up on that ground (54:13 - 54:16)
weakness that can be effectively negated (54:14 - 54:18)
with air balloon makes it so that the (54:16 - 54:21)
weaknesses of Steel defensively are not (54:18 - 54:23)
as bad because you can pair it with (54:21 - 54:25)
other types and size or is a case where (54:23 - 54:28)
there's only one weakness wait fire I'll (54:25 - 54:31)
fire mmm wait fire I just said schizos (54:28 - 54:34)
or is four times weak to fire yeah (54:31 - 54:38)
that's all I really want to make it well (54:34 - 54:40)
I don't I want someone to make a parody (54:38 - 54:42)
of at the drive-in song one armed (54:40 - 54:45)
scissor about one arm size or someone (54:42 - 54:47)
someone could do that get back to me (54:45 - 54:51)
they actually had an email about my (54:47 - 54:53)
wrote in saying that they did not want a (54:51 - 54:56)
new type and they had a reason why um (54:53 - 54:58)
I'll look better probably just me it (54:56 - 55:00)
gets complicated enough as it is here we (54:58 - 55:04)
go here goes so we're not we're not (55:00 - 55:06)
going to do emails this week just (55:04 - 55:08)
because we still have one news article (55:06 - 55:09)
to talk about and we still have pokemon (55:08 - 55:11)
of the week but that doesn't mean you (55:09 - 55:13)
cannot send in your emails which would (55:11 - 55:17)
be at SBJ at pkmn casscom or you go to (55:13 - 55:19)
Pokemon podcast calm and hit the contact (55:17 - 55:22)
button you can send in an email but we (55:19 - 55:25)
will read Joseph Kay's email here just (55:22 - 55:30)
because I have it up Oh Joey k the only (55:25 - 55:33)
Joey k in it doesn't stay what date he's (55:30 - 55:37)
from Joseph rights in hey Logan Steve (55:33 - 55:41)
will and/or Travis since I mentioned him (55:37 - 55:43)
first Logan probably won't even be at (55:41 - 55:50)
the show today it's so good owner and (55:43 - 55:53)
the rest o in reply to Steve's comment (55:50 - 55:55)
in the last short episode adding a (55:53 - 55:58)
t-type for migire nuh I was one of the (55:55 - 55:59)
people that voted in the Twitter poll (55:58 - 56:01)
that i do not want it to see any new (55:59 - 56:02)
types for a while this wasn't (56:01 - 56:04)
necessarily because of the under the (56:02 - 56:07)
dark side this wasn't necessarily (56:04 - 56:09)
because b race your hatred of new types (56:07 - 56:11)
because of the long gap between (56:09 - 56:14)
darksteel and fairy or even because i (56:11 - 56:16)
thought it would be it would damage the (56:14 - 56:19)
metagame in some way though i do though (56:16 - 56:21)
i do think it would be a meat weird move (56:19 - 56:23)
in that regard instead i want to point (56:21 - 56:26)
out that rather than the first in a (56:23 - 56:28)
series of pokemon for generations seven (56:26 - 56:31)
which would imply new rules and maybe a (56:28 - 56:34)
new type the announcement of migire nuh (56:31 - 56:37)
seems to be on track and hacking on to (56:34 - 56:40)
the end of a generation 6 sort of (56:37 - 56:42)
artificially expanding the life of the (56:40 - 56:45)
current games in a similar way that Dion (56:42 - 56:48)
say and bikini on were intended to (56:45 - 56:50)
you so though they were leaked way (56:48 - 56:52)
before they were officially introduced (56:50 - 56:54)
that combined with the fact that McGee (56:52 - 56:56)
erna is starting to starring in a movie (56:54 - 56:59)
with volcania and could easily pass for (56:56 - 57:02)
this steel fairy-type makes me suspect (56:59 - 57:05)
suspect that this isn't the beginning of (57:02 - 57:07)
sound type or glass type when never (57:05 - 57:09)
heard that one before or whatever just (57:07 - 57:11)
some more usage of the fairy mechanic (57:09 - 57:13)
thanks for all you guys do and you (57:11 - 57:15)
should don't totally do torterra for (57:13 - 57:16)
pokemon of the week one of these days (57:15 - 57:19)
too bad don't choose another one yeah (57:16 - 57:21)
but we've done torterra in the past have (57:19 - 57:23)
we oh yeah look at that stupid tree (57:21 - 57:27)
thing yes Pokemon of the week written (57:23 - 57:30)
all over it I never heard of class type (57:27 - 57:32)
but that sounds real appealing too (57:30 - 57:37)
fragile also is ice mmm it brings new (57:32 - 57:41)
meaning to the phrase blast cannon I was (57:37 - 57:43)
gonna say glass house people in glass (57:41 - 57:47)
Pokemon shouldn't throw stones or (57:43 - 57:49)
whatever let me okay let's go over the (57:47 - 57:52)
pokemon that could be class type ah the (57:49 - 57:55)
crime magool thing crayon all that could (57:52 - 58:00)
be glass glass ice ah gonna weird he's (57:55 - 58:02)
real weird it's a real awesome Pokemon (58:00 - 58:04)
though what else could be glass nothing (58:02 - 58:07)
I don't think glass is a good tight just (58:04 - 58:11)
ha I can't take it it's haha all right (58:07 - 58:13)
all the one glass Pokemon crow naugle (58:11 - 58:17)
sure oh no oh alright moving on I am a (58:13 - 58:19)
good points good points in the in the (58:17 - 58:22)
email my only rebuttal to that would be (58:19 - 58:26)
why was it migire nut in the code like (58:22 - 58:28)
all these other legendaries were that (58:26 - 58:30)
were discovered early it's gonna be the (58:28 - 58:34)
code of Z of monsey pokemons emerald (58:30 - 58:37)
Pokemon omegas emerald speaking of (58:34 - 58:41)
pokémon Z the anime has debuted Pokemon (58:37 - 58:44)
X Y Z and will has seen the first (58:41 - 58:47)
episode yeah it was on yesterday it was (58:44 - 58:50)
it was pretty good pretty good or highly (58:47 - 58:52)
good now it was only pretty good i have (58:50 - 58:55)
some concerns about the direction (58:52 - 58:56)
they're heading but seeing as it's the (58:55 - 58:58)
first episode of a new season i will (58:56 - 58:59)
does that mean (58:58 - 59:01)
ash gets all his Pokemon reset are we (58:59 - 59:04)

sport give us a well I mean he's got his (59:05 - 59:12)
greninja um and the in the opening (59:08 - 59:14)
sequence they actually show ash greninja (59:12 - 59:20)
uh yeah he's got challah he's got man ha (59:14 - 59:22)
lucha such a cool pokemon yeah he's (59:20 - 59:26)
pretty cool um wow they actually had (59:22 - 59:28)
them all come out because they were (59:26 - 59:30)
introducing them to another Pokemon is (59:28 - 59:33)
bug still this is muck there no no Jen (59:30 - 59:36)
water God look just so cool sorry Jen (59:33 - 59:37)
ones living with having monkeys living (59:36 - 59:40)
with Professor Oak so you know I don't (59:37 - 59:46)
you know them at our school yeah no idea (59:40 - 59:50)
boy uh I mean he's got a lot of cool (59:46 - 59:54)
pokemon uh and and there's syrena's got (59:50 - 59:57)
hurt do you have our like harleston no (59:54 - 59:58)
way at that's black white number and (59:57 - 60:01)
dedenne is there looking all cute but (59:58 - 60:03)
here's the main thing and this is really (60:01 - 60:06)
i really think people should watch XYZ (60:03 - 60:09)
just because it has one thing that is (60:06 - 60:11)
very different than any Pokemon cartoon (60:09 - 60:14)
ever has we're in there is a Pokemon in (60:11 - 60:17)
the show that has never been in a (60:14 - 60:21)
Pokemon game and that is the forms of (60:17 - 60:25)
zygarde and they just had the first one (60:21 - 60:26)
show up and it was like what I actually (60:25 - 60:29)
tweeted a lot you as well weird the self (60:26 - 60:31)
they show all three and there's actually (60:29 - 60:33)
two types of cells this is three (60:31 - 60:35)
different ones or is it one that turned (60:33 - 60:38)
into all three it is three I'm not gonna (60:35 - 60:41)
split a rate that but there are actually (60:38 - 60:43)
two types of cells is one is a Rua and (60:41 - 60:46)
the ones that did 0 1 is a core and then (60:43 - 60:50)
one is a cell but um I was excited (60:46 - 60:52)
because for the first time at least as (60:50 - 60:55)
far as I know in whose that pokemon they (60:52 - 60:58)
so anyways right Bonnie who is Clements (60:55 - 61:01)
little sister she named the little (60:58 - 61:04)
zygarde core squishy and then when they (61:01 - 61:06)
did who's that Pokemon it was the (61:04 - 61:08)
zygarde core but when it came back is (61:06 - 61:10)
they came back and said who's that (61:08 - 61:12)
pokemon and it was like squishy (61:10 - 61:15)
because it doesn't exist as a real (61:12 - 61:16)
pokemon yet so they're really doing (61:15 - 61:18)
something interesting like with (61:16 - 61:20)
inverting the appearance of way to spoil (61:18 - 61:23)
I'm is that Pokemon it was squishy okay (61:20 - 61:27)
um hi what are you riding on that I find (61:23 - 61:28)
that very interesting NN at the end of (61:27 - 61:30)
the episode because most people probably (61:28 - 61:32)
if you don't watch it you're not going (61:30 - 61:35)
to watch it they did show along from the (61:32 - 61:38)
mega evolution specials crossing paths (61:35 - 61:41)
with ash and the gang so you know that (61:38 - 61:42)
they're going to have an interaction (61:41 - 61:46)
coming up so point of correction that (61:42 - 61:48)
isn't the first time they've had a (61:46 - 61:50)
Pokemon that hasn't been in a game in (61:48 - 61:54)
the UH all right okay the fight it was (61:50 - 61:56)
actually like a featured and interactive (61:54 - 62:00)
not like hoo in the big Chuck I'm (61:56 - 62:04)
talking about Muriel oh yeah yeah in the (62:00 - 62:08)
Pokemon movie and Pikachu's (62:04 - 62:11)
adventure these vacation yeah you're (62:08 - 62:14)
right okay I I will correct your (62:11 - 62:17)
correction because for as far as how the (62:14 - 62:21)
cartoon is not canon to the true story (62:17 - 62:24)
of Pokemon reality oh yeah yeah worse (62:21 - 62:28)
the movies have nothing to do with their (62:24 - 62:31)
reality of them and I'm glad I'm glad (62:28 - 62:32)
that's the fact i mean i've talked a few (62:31 - 62:34)
weeks ago but how weird it is that in (62:32 - 62:37)
the movie they imply that that ash is (62:34 - 62:41)
like the descendant of Lucario night man (62:37 - 62:44)
that's pretty weird hey once you make (62:41 - 62:46)
out with a pokemon like ash did you can (62:44 - 62:49)
do anything keep bringing that up this (62:46 - 62:51)
is more about you than it says about the (62:49 - 62:59)
moose Travis (62:51 - 63:01)
yeah can you give us an update on super (62:59 - 63:04)
mystery dungeon I haven't really played (63:01 - 63:08)

diamonds once a day is that a lot of (64:21 - 64:29)
diamonds will 40 yes Wow I usually get (64:24 - 64:31)
like one at most two a day and I play (64:29 - 64:34)
every single day and I need like 50 more (64:31 - 64:37)
just to get another balloon the eShop (64:34 - 64:40)
version was released on April 8 2015 the (64:37 - 64:42)
physical version was released in japan (64:40 - 64:45)
on november nineteenth and in europe on (64:42 - 64:47)
january twenty second and australia I'm (64:45 - 64:49)
january twenty third though we will be (64:47 - 64:54)
we as in America will be getting at last (64:49 - 64:59)
but I wonder if it's the save data is (64:54 - 65:02)
separate from the eShop version like I (64:59 - 65:04)
wonder if you'd have to start over well (65:02 - 65:05)
if you bought the physical yeah I (65:04 - 65:08)
wondered that myself and I need somebody (65:05 - 65:09)
else to find out for me because I have (65:08 - 65:11)
far too much time invested in that game (65:09 - 65:14)
to like start over run the risk how much (65:11 - 65:16)
if you wanted to buy three thousand (65:14 - 65:18)
pokey diamonds though in the in the (65:16 - 65:21)
micro transaction one how much does that (65:18 - 65:23)
run you I think it was like if you spent (65:21 - 65:25)
thirty dollars you just unlocked (65:23 - 65:27)
everything yeah yeah I'm looking at it (65:25 - 65:31)
right now and it's uh 1,000 diamonds for (65:27 - 65:35)
999 but you don't get the 40 a day yeah (65:31 - 65:36)
but once you buy five (65:35 - 65:37)
thousand diamonds it does something (65:36 - 65:38)
where it's like you never need to buy (65:37 - 65:42)
another diamond ever again okay okay got (65:38 - 65:44)
it all right well that wraps it up for (65:42 - 65:46)

Pokemon of the week this week's pokemon (66:53 - 67:00)
of the week I've just been hitting (66:56 - 67:03)
random on bulbapedia and heat more was (67:00 - 67:06)
the first Pokemon that popped up heat (67:03 - 67:08)
more as a cool pokemon he is the ant (67:06 - 67:12)
eater pokemon it's very steampunk not (67:08 - 67:15)
enough years yeah but he's got that was (67:12 - 67:18)
she like coming out his back i like i (67:15 - 67:20)
like pokemon that have rivalries with (67:18 - 67:24)
other pokemon so um keep more in durant (67:20 - 67:28)
and seviper and mongoose pokemon what's (67:24 - 67:31)
his name Zangoose tinker's that's cool (67:28 - 67:34)
the old Mongoose Travis you gotta move (67:31 - 67:36)
set for heat more let's do something (67:34 - 67:41)
weird we're already picking heat more so (67:36 - 67:46)
let's do right kemo look heat mores (67:41 - 67:50)
it's a weird Pokemon it kind of doesn't (67:46 - 67:53)
really even fit with the aesthetic of (67:50 - 67:57)
Gen 5 it's kind of just there you're (67:53 - 68:00)
picking if you're picking he more you (67:57 - 68:01)
want to do something weird anyway so (68:00 - 68:05)
let's let's get weird we're going to do (68:01 - 68:07)
assault vest heat more now if you (68:05 - 68:10)
remember assault vest is an item that (68:07 - 68:12)
makes it so the downside is you can't (68:10 - 68:15)
use any moves that are nondamaging you (68:12 - 68:17)
have to use all damaging moves however (68:15 - 68:19)
assault vest is an item that the (68:17 - 68:22)
downside where you can't use any (68:19 - 68:24)
nondamaging rousseau all of your moves (68:22 - 68:27)
have to be damaging there's no status (68:24 - 68:31)
moves however it increases your special (68:27 - 68:36)
defense by 50% safety yep hang up it's (68:31 - 68:38)
pretty good fifty percent of your (68:36 - 68:41)
special your special defense right right (68:38 - 68:43)
let's get weird let's do assault vest (68:41 - 68:45)
eat more you're going to want flash fire (68:43 - 68:46)
because that's actually a pretty good (68:45 - 68:50)
ability makes you immune to fire attacks (68:46 - 68:53)
and makes your fire attacks more (68:50 - 68:54)
powerful when you aren't hit by a fire (68:53 - 68:56)
tech so you can have something like a (68:54 - 68:59)
size are out and then wow if your team (68:56 - 69:01)
has size or and eat more I have no idea (68:59 - 69:03)
what kind of person you are we're using (69:01 - 69:05)
like the most competitive Pokemon on the (69:03 - 69:07)
planet and eat more anyway you can have (69:05 - 69:09)
something four times a week to fire and (69:07 - 69:10)
then bait out a fire type moves (69:09 - 69:14)
switching to heat more it gets the flash (69:10 - 69:16)
fire bone is making its fire type moves (69:14 - 69:19)
stronger we want that fire-type move and (69:16 - 69:21)
that's going to be Fire Blast we're (69:19 - 69:24)
gonna do giga drain as well because it's (69:21 - 69:26)
kind of cool that it gets giga drain (69:24 - 69:31)
Focus Blast is another special attack (69:26 - 69:35)
move that it can learn um I had a fourth (69:31 - 69:37)
move over now (69:35 - 69:41)
now we already have Fire Blast um bit up (69:37 - 69:46)
no follow yeah that's what we're gonna (69:41 - 69:49)
know uh butter punch know yet any (69:46 - 69:50)
specialist we're going we're going (69:49 - 69:56)
special attack mmm belch oh I think I (69:50 - 69:58)
was just gonna do um I never even knew (69:56 - 70:00)
there was a move called belt but that'll (69:58 - 70:03)
belches Chloe it eats it eats your um (70:00 - 70:06)
your berry and that aura it only works (70:03 - 70:09)
if you've eaten a berry oh you could do (70:06 - 70:12)
a gluttony heat more belch more you (70:09 - 70:15)
could not probably just probably just (70:12 - 70:20)
like a kitten power hidden power (70:15 - 70:22)
whatever strikes your fancy so fire (70:20 - 70:26)
blast giga drain focus blast then hidden (70:22 - 70:29)
power i guess you'd want something good (70:26 - 70:33)
against you very got ground covered (70:29 - 70:36)
you've already got water covered rock (70:33 - 70:38)
you've already got rock coming with gay (70:36 - 70:42)
drain oh yeah dragon a hidden power ice (70:38 - 70:45)
sure give it that assault vest we were (70:42 - 70:49)
talking about give it a (70:45 - 70:51)
whatever the nature is that decreases (70:49 - 70:56)
your physical attack and well no scratch (70:51 - 70:57)
that just do modest that's probably (70:56 - 70:58)
because you're going to want to actually (70:57 - 71:01)
be able to take things out and then you (70:58 - 71:05)
can do 250 2 v's and HP and the special (71:01 - 71:07)
attack call it a day is it going to be (71:05 - 71:12)
good no you pick Tibor okay I like it I (71:07 - 71:16)
like that I heat more has a decent shiny (71:12 - 71:19)
it's like a dark like a rich red and (71:16 - 71:22)
like a darker black opposed to it's very (71:19 - 71:29)
mellow red and more of a brownish and as (71:22 - 71:31)
said earlier heat more as being the (71:29 - 71:33)
natural predator of Durant reflected on (71:31 - 71:36)
their types heat more and Durant share a (71:33 - 71:38)
lot of similarities they share the same (71:36 - 71:40)
a level rate they say share the same (71:38 - 71:43)
catch rate hatch time base experience (71:40 - 71:46)
yield total base stats and gender ratio (71:43 - 71:48)
and if you didn't know eat more is based (71:46 - 71:50)
on an anteater that is why it's the (71:48 - 71:54)
anteater pokémon that's not it it's uh (71:50 - 71:56)
appeared in me anime a couple times sure (71:54 - 72:00)
why not hey wheres pokemon out there now (71:56 - 72:03)
it's pretty cool mega heat more titled (72:00 - 72:05)
it mega hit more hit here we come (72:03 - 72:09)
Keeler's fine but it like so i always (72:05 - 72:13)
the sound of someone saying the new (72:09 - 72:15)
pokemon don't feel like pokemon is nails (72:13 - 72:18)
on the chalkboard to me which i'm sure i (72:15 - 72:19)
don't have to except sure i'd be (72:18 - 72:21)
preaching to the choir if I said why but (72:19 - 72:24)
heat more I think that Curtis isn't at (72:21 - 72:26)
megget i would get i would add matt i (72:24 - 72:29)
would add mecha type to eat more since (72:26 - 72:31)
he's got the tail pipe and the intake (72:29 - 72:34)
filters no but does have a tail pipe i (72:31 - 72:37)
just made me mad now well like I look at (72:34 - 72:39)
heat more in Durant like a lot like (72:37 - 72:41)
Durant would make a good mecha type (72:39 - 72:45)
there you go uh I look at heat more and (72:41 - 72:49)
Durant just like scyther and pincer they (72:45 - 72:52)
were just too cool pokemon that just fit (72:49 - 72:54)
together as a pair the differences (72:52 - 72:58)
Scyther got scizor the next generation (72:54 - 73:03)
and then eventually we got mega pincer (72:58 - 73:06)
you know 17 years later mega pins are so (73:03 - 73:09)
rad but yeah I just I just see those (73:06 - 73:11)
those two as like you can say all he (73:09 - 73:13)
more doesn't really fit like now he (73:11 - 73:16)
definitely fits he just he's just a (73:13 - 73:19)
single pokemon that has a rival and both (73:16 - 73:20)
those pokemon get forgotten together and (73:19 - 73:23)
they shouldn't cuz you're cool during it (73:20 - 73:25)
sweet I ran a really competitive Durant (73:23 - 73:27)
