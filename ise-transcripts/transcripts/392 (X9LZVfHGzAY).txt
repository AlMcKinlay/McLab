go to the patreon only feed but we (1:46 - 1:51)
decided to make the first episode free (1:49 - 1:54)
so we can get your taste buds a little (1:51 - 1:57)
wet right it is always free kids yeah (1:54 - 1:59)
the remainder of the Twilight winds will (1:57 - 2:02)

but I read and I like the first episode (2:02 - 2:07)
so you can listen to our thoughts on (2:05 - 2:10)
that on that version of the podcast (2:07 - 2:14)
speaking of podcasts we got some Pokemon (2:10 - 2:17)
news it feels like an eternity since (2:14 - 2:20)
they announced the Pokemon expansion (2:17 - 2:22)
pack I know I feel so long though I (2:20 - 2:23)
don't know (2:22 - 2:25)
feels real long you're you're running (2:23 - 2:27)
into that old person time it is it is we (2:25 - 2:28)
got one thing wrong last week I just (2:27 - 2:29)
want to start off with that correction (2:28 - 2:31)
you pulled off Pokemon calm I don't know (2:29 - 2:33)
how we missed this cub foo will either (2:31 - 2:36)
evolve into single strike style or Shifu (2:33 - 2:39)
or rapid style strike a Shifu which (2:36 - 2:41)
form it evolves into will change (2:39 - 2:43)
depending on the choices made during (2:41 - 2:47)
your adventure the forms are not tied to (2:43 - 2:49)
game the game versions you are playing (2:47 - 2:51)
oh well that's that's good yeah you (2:49 - 2:53)
scaling to get one though right (2:51 - 2:55)
or can you I don't know if you get (2:53 - 2:58)
multiple Cub Foods because I feel like (2:55 - 3:00)
if it's based off the choices you make (2:58 - 3:03)
you make that choice you know someone (3:00 - 3:08)
always says not always black and white (3:03 - 3:08)
you get one choice in one of them and (3:09 - 3:16)
that's it you're you're stuck with (3:12 - 3:19)
whatever style with that game because (3:16 - 3:21)
those are the choices you made until you (3:19 - 3:24)
get that D evolution spray yeah yeah is (3:21 - 3:27)
that coming hopefully soon let's get (3:24 - 3:30)
into the real news here you will start (3:27 - 3:33)
with thoughts or with Pokemon masters oh (3:30 - 3:36)
joy (3:33 - 3:36)
let's there's a new update here are they (3:37 - 3:45)
added like a new thing I haven't I (3:42 - 3:47)
haven't experimented with it yet so I (3:45 - 3:49)
hope I hope Greg didn't share some light (3:47 - 3:51)
here it's been a real busy week for me (3:49 - 3:54)
so my masters gameplay has gone a little (3:51 - 3:56)
bit down you don't think I could share (3:54 - 3:58)
some light Steve shed some light yeah (3:56 - 4:00)
you could probably I mean I guess a view (3:58 - 4:04)
for the Pokemon go segment stay in your (4:00 - 4:08)
lane Bobby but if you vote that masters (4:04 - 4:12)
feedback that's great I will probably (4:08 - 4:13)
announce this on stream later today I (4:12 - 4:15)
guess if you're listening the podcast (4:13 - 4:17)
you can hear it here first complete full (4:15 - 4:21)
disclosure DNA developer of Pokemon (4:17 - 4:24)
masters reached out to me and asked if I (4:21 - 4:26)
would like to be a partner for their (4:24 - 4:30)
game I signed some agreements and what (4:26 - 4:33)
that means is I get to see a little bit (4:30 - 4:36)
of behind the scenes of Pokemon masters (4:33 - 4:39)
so I am aware of when things are coming (4:36 - 4:41)
out prior to you guys now although I'm (4:39 - 4:42)
not allowed to disclose that kind of (4:41 - 4:45)
stuff I can't believe the point of this (4:42 - 4:48)
deal I can't read Pokemon masters (4:45 - 4:51)
- game comm I can't read off that that's (4:48 - 4:51)
true (4:51 - 4:54)
the partnership also they give me a (4:51 - 4:55)
they'll they'll start to give me a (4:54 - 4:58)
stipend every month for free gems so (4:55 - 5:00)
that's that's the benefit Greg I'm in (4:58 - 5:05)
the deep gem pocket of DIA now I'm at (5:00 - 5:10)
you know I'm more mad at you know so (5:05 - 5:12)
just full disclosure there obviously (5:10 - 5:14)
I've had problems with masters in the (5:12 - 5:16)
past that probably now puts two into two (5:14 - 5:18)
together of why I've been playing more (5:16 - 5:21)
masters because DNA is trying really (5:18 - 5:23)
hard to make sure that (5:21 - 5:24)
people who are playing masters both (5:23 - 5:27)
content creators and their fan base (5:24 - 5:29)
their audience are happy with the game (5:27 - 5:31)
with that being said there's a new (5:29 - 5:34)
message from the Pokemon masters team (5:31 - 5:36)
volume six Greg they've changed some (5:34 - 5:40)
stuff and the disclosure Greg and Bobby (5:36 - 5:43)
are not in the big pockets of DNA no so (5:40 - 5:45)
I can be as rude as I walk it's true (5:43 - 5:48)
yeah they could it can be and I don't (5:45 - 5:50)
have the game even on my phone so I'm (5:48 - 5:51)
neither here nor there (5:50 - 5:53)
alright why you didn't have anything to (5:51 - 5:55)
say about it well I just wanted to be (5:53 - 5:58)
invited no okay alright but why would we (5:55 - 6:00)
invite you to a party you don't want to (5:58 - 6:02)
be it well maybe in my patient is nice (6:00 - 6:04)
volume six we'll get you back into the (6:02 - 6:06)
game that's where the turning point is (6:04 - 6:08)
volume six so they added something (6:06 - 6:12)
called sync grids that has that was (6:08 - 6:14)
scheduled for Mitch anywhere it actually (6:12 - 6:16)
just came out they will feature there (6:14 - 6:17)
are new features that allow you to (6:16 - 6:19)
strengthen your sync pairs in various (6:17 - 6:22)
ways the basics here in order to (6:19 - 6:25)
activate tiles in the sync grid you will (6:22 - 6:27)
need to collect sync orbs at the (6:25 - 6:28)
beginning of the battle the sync orb (6:27 - 6:31)
chance message may appear by using sync (6:28 - 6:33)
orbs to activate tiles you can teach and (6:31 - 6:36)
sync pairs with new grid skills however (6:33 - 6:38)
activating the tiles will reduce your (6:36 - 6:40)
pool of available energy some tiles on (6:38 - 6:42)
the sync radition Ulrich's such as (6:40 - 6:45)
minimum sync level and we were planning (6:42 - 6:47)
to have the following features unlocked (6:45 - 6:49)
you can stat rays sync move enhancements (6:47 - 6:52)
improve to move effectiveness and (6:49 - 6:55)
accuracy and passive skills and they (6:52 - 6:57)
have some future plans here in late (6:55 - 7:00)
January price and seal everyone's (6:57 - 7:04)
favorite couple will happen no anyone's (7:00 - 7:06)
ever set prices their favorite trainer (7:04 - 7:07)
but maybe I don't know there's probably (7:06 - 7:09)
somebody out there they will have their (7:07 - 7:13)
sync grid expanded generally we as in (7:09 - 7:15)
DNA are planning on expanding sync grids (7:13 - 7:19)
for about 4 sync pairs each month I have (7:15 - 7:21)
not played with the sync grid Greg have (7:19 - 7:24)
you synced grid and did I've started a (7:21 - 7:27)
little there there's a new requirement a (7:24 - 7:31)
new thing to get which is sync orbs so (7:27 - 7:33)
you certain things need sync orb so (7:31 - 7:37)
unfortunately again there's like they've (7:33 - 7:39)
added a way to try to make these pairs (7:37 - 7:42)
better that comes with a grind as of (7:39 - 7:45)
like right now there doesn't seem to be (7:42 - 7:50)
an ideal like a super ideal path to (7:45 - 7:54)
follow for the sinks so like depending (7:50 - 7:58)
on what you want out of each sink pair (7:54 - 8:00)
there are different ways to go which is (7:58 - 8:03)
actually nice but also we're very early (8:00 - 8:06)
into this so it's hard to say that (8:03 - 8:10)
oh there's five choices right now but (8:06 - 8:12)
ultimately four of those choices are (8:10 - 8:16)
terrible and aren't worth it it's (8:12 - 8:19)
interesting that way at least I know at (8:16 - 8:21)
least for the Infernape build there's a (8:19 - 8:24)
lot I think there's four that people (8:21 - 8:26)
like for the main character and I think (8:24 - 8:29)
the Flannery one has like two that are (8:26 - 8:32)
like worth it I have obviously have not (8:29 - 8:35)
gotten them completely built out so I (8:32 - 8:37)
don't know how big of a difference it (8:35 - 8:40)
makes this is clearly them trying to (8:37 - 8:43)
make it so that you can play your (8:40 - 8:45)
favorite sync pairs and not have them be (8:43 - 8:49)
completely useless at endgame I don't (8:45 - 8:53)
know if it's enough and since it comes (8:49 - 8:56)
with a grind I don't know if unless (8:53 - 8:59)
you're heavily invested that you're (8:56 - 9:02)
gonna want to grind out all the items (8:59 - 9:06)
necessary to max out Flannery like if (9:02 - 9:07)
you're not gonna use Flannery and (9:06 - 9:10)
torkoal and plenary is a 3-star and (9:07 - 9:12)
Infernape if you haven't earned it but a (9:10 - 9:15)
lot of people do is just the better fire (9:12 - 9:17)
type unless you're really invested in (9:15 - 9:20)
Flannery I don't see why you would grind (9:17 - 9:25)
to do that sync grid unless you didn't (9:20 - 9:27)
have you didn't have the Infernape (9:25 - 9:29)
yeah II didn't have him print it but (9:27 - 9:31)
this is also the problem of now that (9:29 - 9:34)
they've somewhat improved summoning you (9:31 - 9:37)
get more gems so since you can summon (9:34 - 9:42)
more it feels less bad when you get the (9:37 - 9:44)
worst summons because it's like well I (9:42 - 9:45)
only have to wait a couple of days and I (9:44 - 9:48)
can summon again knowing that there are (9:45 - 9:51)
better ones out there like I (9:48 - 9:54)
have my only ground-type right now is (9:51 - 9:59)
clay and it's not good the good one is (9:54 - 10:01)
Cynthia and so it's like well I don't (9:59 - 10:05)
want to put anything into clay because I (10:01 - 10:07)
know at some point I will probably get (10:05 - 10:09)
the random chance to get Cynthia I guess (10:07 - 10:13)
my question is is the sinc ruied yes (10:09 - 10:18)
hold from a different game well yes sort (10:13 - 10:21)
of if anybody ever played Final Fantasy (10:18 - 10:24)
10 is a similar system where you're (10:21 - 10:27)
following paths to unlock or increase (10:24 - 10:33)
abilities so 10 had sort of the talent (10:27 - 10:36)
tree system where you put gems in a grid (10:33 - 10:38)
and you could take different paths it's (10:36 - 10:40)
very similar to that oh so there's not (10:38 - 10:42)
like a current MOU there's not a current (10:40 - 10:45)
gotcha game on the market like dragalge (10:42 - 10:50)
I lost or so Duvalier lost has grids but (10:45 - 10:54)
they're set there's not paths so you can (10:50 - 10:57)
enhance the mana and abilities in a very (10:54 - 11:00)
specific way for each character this (10:57 - 11:03)
offers choices like there are different (11:00 - 11:07)
paths but we don't know yet if the other (11:03 - 11:10)
paths are viable paths or if it's really (11:07 - 11:12)
just there's one viable path and all (11:10 - 11:15)
other options are terrible (11:12 - 11:17)
because it's still really really early (11:15 - 11:20)
and how this is gonna and it's like what (11:17 - 11:21)
are they going to come up with next when (11:20 - 11:24)
do you use them what do you use them for (11:21 - 11:29)
my hope is that they've made it in such (11:24 - 11:31)
a way that you can build out how you (11:29 - 11:32)
like to play with that character and (11:31 - 11:35)
that will always still be valid and it (11:32 - 11:37)
doesn't fall in the trap that a lot of (11:35 - 11:39)
talent tree systems fall into where yeah (11:37 - 11:42)
there's 15 paths but really there's just (11:39 - 11:44)
one and right only one good path and (11:42 - 11:46)
there's a billion bad choices with a lot (11:44 - 11:47)
of people who play gotcha games they (11:46 - 11:50)
want to min/max that's kind of the issue (11:47 - 11:52)
we saw at the beginning of masters which (11:50 - 11:57)
was well the only three good characters (11:52 - 11:59)
at the moment are I don't even remember (11:57 - 12:02)
what they were at the time I think (11:59 - 12:04)
Olivia was one (12:02 - 12:06)
the top Karen was the top for a long (12:04 - 12:08)
time until they did liepard so Karen in (12:06 - 12:10)
life hard sort of switched cuz there are (12:08 - 12:13)
only good dark types Phoebe is still (12:10 - 12:15)
probably the best tank that is out there (12:13 - 12:18)
like they have not topped a tank like (12:15 - 12:20)
Phoebe I do like baby she's yeah baby (12:18 - 12:22)
and dustox says it is a great is a great (12:20 - 12:26)
pair it's a great support it's just (12:22 - 12:28)
probably the best one to get on (12:26 - 12:31)
single-player teams because everything (12:28 - 12:35)
attacks dusclops and it's got so much (12:31 - 12:38)
health that all of your more frail (12:35 - 12:41)
attackers can just be like hey we have (12:38 - 12:42)
free reign to the battlefield look that (12:41 - 12:45)
slop goes way beyond Pokemon masters (12:42 - 12:51)
it's a menacing sword and shoot yeah (12:45 - 12:54)
this is I will say this is a positive (12:51 - 12:58)
step in making the pairs that you want (12:54 - 13:02)
to use better once they get it out for (12:58 - 13:05)
everybody there's still a grind I hate I (13:02 - 13:08)
just hate that there's no Auto skip (13:05 - 13:11)
feature it's just to have to grind all (13:08 - 13:13)
of this out like I was gonna play today (13:11 - 13:15)
and everything that's in front of me is (13:13 - 13:17)
just a grind I have to grind against (13:15 - 13:19)
this or after grind against that or I (13:17 - 13:22)
have to grind over here and I just (13:19 - 13:23)
couldn't do it (13:22 - 13:26)
like I meant I compared that to Drew (13:23 - 13:28)
Galia lost we're right now in to rally I (13:26 - 13:31)
lost all I have to do is a grind but I (13:28 - 13:36)
have skip passes so 90% of it is me just (13:31 - 13:38)
saying yep I know I have to do this just (13:36 - 13:39)
give me the rewards I've done this (13:38 - 13:43)
50,000 times and I can get those out of (13:39 - 13:46)
the way and then go play the more fun (13:43 - 13:48)
still a little bit granted but the more (13:46 - 13:51)
fund rate content and then I'm done I'm (13:48 - 13:54)
not done in in 20 minutes I you know got (13:51 - 13:56)
everything I needed to get done for the (13:54 - 14:00)
day I know it's a grind so I didn't have (13:56 - 14:02)
to suffer whereas if I was gonna go into (14:00 - 14:06)
masters it's like well I will spend 20 (14:02 - 14:08)
minutes on this fighting three battles (14:06 - 14:11)
and that will get me an eighth of the (14:08 - 14:14)
way of where I need to be to even start (14:11 - 14:16)
making dents and some of the grind that (14:14 - 14:17)
I have to do (14:16 - 14:18)
do you think the reason is for that (14:17 - 14:21)
though do you think that they DNA thinks (14:18 - 14:23)
that people will just play their game (14:21 - 14:27)
longer versus like just not playing the (14:23 - 14:30)
game yes well that DNA I saw this is the (14:27 - 14:32)
tricky question maybe I can just like (14:30 - 14:35)
ask them now that I'm in this partner (14:32 - 14:38)
discord with them but I wonder if it's (14:35 - 14:40)
like the same actual team who made Fire (14:38 - 14:44)
Emblem because did am i yes he did DNA (14:40 - 14:47)
not publish Fire Emblem that has poles (14:44 - 14:48)
well that's a different kind of grind (14:47 - 14:50)
though I don't know cuz you're that's (14:48 - 14:54)
more of like a turn-based tactical I (14:50 - 14:56)
just think of the pulling heroes from (14:54 - 14:59)
that yeah I mean it was a Gacha game and (14:56 - 15:01)
it did have a grind what was it called (14:59 - 15:03)
Fire Emblem yeah it was higher but (15:01 - 15:07)
Emblem here is right yeah mm-hmm I guess (15:03 - 15:09)
I don't know how many like studios or (15:07 - 15:11)
maybe Studios isn't the right word (15:09 - 15:13)
teams inside DNA or making different (15:11 - 15:15)
games cuz like there's DNA also made (15:13 - 15:17)
Animal Crossing (15:15 - 15:19)
well firing heroes was made by (15:17 - 15:21)
intelligent systems that sounds like a (15:19 - 15:23)
conglomerate that owns a bunch of other (15:21 - 15:27)
yeah I don't know they break out or I (15:23 - 15:31)
want to find him with DNA how de na de (15:27 - 15:35)
na ok so right now in 2019 they've done (15:31 - 15:38)
hope my Master's with the cooperation of (15:35 - 15:41)
the Pokemon company obviously DNA has to (15:38 - 15:46)
report back to the big old TPC Mario (15:41 - 15:49)
Kart Animal Crossing pocket camp they (15:46 - 15:51)
did do Fire Emblem knew well they did (15:49 - 15:54)
with development with cooperation of (15:51 - 15:55)
intelligence system well that's the same (15:54 - 15:57)
as that's the same as TCP I because (15:55 - 16:00)
intelligent systems technically I pretty (15:57 - 16:01)
sure owns part of Fire Emblem do they (16:00 - 16:05)
not yeah closely affiliate with Nintendo (16:01 - 16:08)
best for developing a Fire Emblem Paper (16:05 - 16:11)
Mario warrior where and the wars series (16:08 - 16:14)
got it and then they made Super Mario (16:11 - 16:16)
run and they made miitomo (16:14 - 16:19)
and I even know me tome was still going (16:16 - 16:23)
no it didn't it ended may 9 2008 so yep (16:19 - 16:26)
2008 (16:23 - 16:30)
maybe 2018 does feel like 2008 at this (16:26 - 16:32)
point is ancient history here (16:30 - 16:36)
I mean I'll say this for a lot it's not (16:32 - 16:40)
uncommon in a lot of the Gacha games (16:36 - 16:41)
that you have to play through the (16:40 - 16:46)
content because they still see you (16:41 - 16:49)
playing their game no matter how much of (16:46 - 16:53)
a grind it is as getting touch and value (16:49 - 16:54)
out of the game (16:53 - 16:57)
Plus well correct okay so but grinds not (16:54 - 17:02)
terribly awful no but the the main (16:57 - 17:04)
problem the main I just said that as (17:02 - 17:06)
somebody who is probably 90% of our (17:04 - 17:09)
listeners are guilty of battle melee for (17:06 - 17:11)
200 times or riding their bike in a (17:09 - 17:13)
circle in the hatching 500 eggs (17:11 - 17:15)
the biggest difference about the grind (17:13 - 17:18)
in mobile and why they don't do a lot of (17:15 - 17:21)
skips is because part of the goal is to (17:18 - 17:23)
make you frustrated enough to buy the (17:21 - 17:27)
shortcut there's a there's a level of oh (17:23 - 17:32)
I have to spend two hours getting this (17:27 - 17:33)
to where I need to to continue the game (17:32 - 17:40)
or I could spend $15 and then just get (17:33 - 17:42)
all the things I need it's a philosophy (17:40 - 17:44)
that is common that I don't agree with (17:42 - 17:47)
like I have given more money to do Galia (17:44 - 17:49)
Lost than I have any other mobile game (17:47 - 17:53)
simply because I feel like they are (17:49 - 17:57)
being very nice to me and I enjoy that (17:53 - 17:59)
experience so therefore I will give them (17:57 - 18:02)
money whereas when I hit walls and other (17:59 - 18:04)
games and Pokemon masters is by no means (18:02 - 18:08)
the worst offender although I still (18:04 - 18:10)
think their pricing scale is outrageous (18:08 - 18:14)
like a lot of other games like this hit (18:10 - 18:17)
you with a wall that is deliberately (18:14 - 18:19)
frustrating to get you to pay money see (18:17 - 18:22)
but clash royale was like that and I (18:19 - 18:24)
feel like clash Royale is no longer like (18:22 - 18:26)
that yeah what they also learned so they (18:24 - 18:31)
learned like what almost two years (18:26 - 18:33)
yeah like learn learn I don't think they (18:31 - 18:36)
learned fast right but they did learn (18:33 - 18:39)
that people will view a game (18:36 - 18:41)
and I think part of it is they saw the (18:39 - 18:44)
writing on the wall with Apple arcade (18:41 - 18:50)
that the pay2win model is a short term (18:44 - 18:53)
solution and that people are gonna get (18:50 - 18:57)
real tired of that real quick and so I (18:53 - 18:59)
think clash Royale did the thing like (18:57 - 19:01)
they saw the writing on the wall and (18:59 - 19:04)
said okay no we have to change like this (19:01 - 19:06)
has to be a different model and I don't (19:04 - 19:08)
think any of these other games are there (19:06 - 19:10)
yet I think they still rely on that will (19:08 - 19:12)
frustrate them until they pay money (19:10 - 19:14)
model which guarantees I won't give (19:12 - 19:16)
money (19:14 - 19:19)
I just won't I won't pay you I won't pay (19:16 - 19:21)
you for a frustrating experience I will (19:19 - 19:24)
pay you for a very enjoyable experience (19:21 - 19:27)
so I do yeah I will agree with that half (19:24 - 19:31)
I do enjoy games that have a frustrating (19:27 - 19:32)
experience built into them but not ones (19:31 - 19:35)
that have it built into them to make you (19:32 - 19:38)
pay more right so like the games that I (19:35 - 19:40)
find I find games fun that where like I (19:38 - 19:42)
want to throw the controller at the TV (19:40 - 19:46)
sometimes right but only went because (19:42 - 19:49)
once you get past that it's like feels (19:46 - 19:50)
so good to get past it but if your (19:49 - 19:52)
frustration is leaving you to pay more (19:50 - 19:55)
money then that is it I don't want to do (19:52 - 19:57)
that I feel like I don't have that with (19:55 - 20:01)
mobile games in general except first (19:57 - 20:02)
couple months of clash for I was like oh (20:01 - 20:07)
my gosh I need to uninstall this I (20:02 - 20:10)
finally broke my clash royale sword and (20:07 - 20:12)
shield broke me free of clash Royale (20:10 - 20:13)
yeah I feel like sword and shield kind (20:12 - 20:15)
of broke me free of clash Royale - I (20:13 - 20:17)
feel like I don't I don't want to go in (20:15 - 20:20)
I'm like I look at it like I could go in (20:17 - 20:22)
but (20:20 - 20:24)
no it's for us it's kind of a (20:22 - 20:27)
frustrating game yeah it broke like also (20:24 - 20:30)
I also use Pokemon go as another example (20:27 - 20:32)
of a game that I have put money in but I (20:30 - 20:36)
put money in when it was to spend time (20:32 - 20:37)
with my friend like to do more raids (20:36 - 20:39)
like I've bought raid passes (20:37 - 20:42)
I have bought other things with my with (20:39 - 20:45)
my friends I've never felt like I had to (20:42 - 20:47)
pay money to get enjoyment out of (20:45 - 20:50)
Pokemon go and so I have given them (20:47 - 20:52)
money while I gripe about it because I (20:50 - 20:56)
don't like giving money away for I don't (20:52 - 20:57)
I don't like giving money way for (20:56 - 20:59)
digital goods though that are ephemeral (20:57 - 21:02)
but I understand that I'm doing that to (20:59 - 21:03)
participate in the things with my (21:02 - 21:06)
friends that I enjoy and Pokemon go (21:03 - 21:09)
doesn't make me do that to enjoy their (21:06 - 21:12)
game and so I don't well hate giving (21:09 - 21:14)
them money some of their events (21:12 - 21:17)
definitely require money but yeah those (21:14 - 21:21)
events like that's that's a good choice (21:17 - 21:24)
because I don't like the exclusivity (21:21 - 21:28)
that Pokemon go puts on certain like but (21:24 - 21:30)
usually it comes down to Chinese right (21:28 - 21:33)
Chinese I felt like I need to just spend (21:30 - 21:36)
money to get a Wurmple oh oh I didn't (21:33 - 21:37)
send it I got my we're pulling a party (21:36 - 21:41)
hat today that I nice it's the same (21:37 - 21:43)
thing going back to you know whether a (21:41 - 21:46)
game wants you to pay money to skip or (21:43 - 21:48)
if you want to spend the two hours and (21:46 - 21:49)
doing yourself and Pokemon go has that (21:48 - 21:53)
with incubators of do you want to hatch (21:49 - 21:56)
1/2 K incubator at a time or do you want (21:53 - 22:01)
to buy more to hatch multiple or do you (21:56 - 22:02)
want to walk like four times the (22:01 - 22:06)
distance right and that's ok you yeah (22:02 - 22:08)
Chinese costumes whatever it may be but (22:06 - 22:11)
the fact that they put party hat Wurmple (22:08 - 22:16)
in eggs specifically and then gave that (22:11 - 22:19)
a you know a timeline there a deadline (22:16 - 22:21)
it (22:19 - 22:23)
of the same feeling where I spent money (22:21 - 22:26)
I don't know if it was was it wasn't (22:23 - 22:28)
really happy to but I wanted to get this (22:26 - 22:33)
this Pokemon and I knew I had to spend (22:28 - 22:35)
money in order to try to get that and (22:33 - 22:36)
even more so like the shiny one which I (22:35 - 22:38)
never ended up getting so I just spent (22:36 - 22:40)
that money and for chance which (22:38 - 22:43)
obviously is my fault I chose to do that (22:40 - 22:45)
I understand that but I just don't like (22:43 - 22:49)
when it's just behind a paywall because (22:45 - 22:51)
people will say oh well no it's not (22:49 - 22:53)
behind a paywall you could just hatch (22:51 - 22:54)
one egg at a time with the free (22:53 - 22:55)
incubator or you could go to gyms every (22:54 - 22:57)
day and get your coins up and then (22:55 - 23:00)
that's how you do it but that's not (22:57 - 23:03)
really I mean Pokemon go nose or neon (23:00 - 23:05)
technic knows that they put something in (23:03 - 23:08)
an egg for two weeks that people are (23:05 - 23:10)
going to spend a lot of money to try to (23:08 - 23:12)
get that oh yeah so even though yes (23:10 - 23:15)
there are ways of getting free coins it (23:12 - 23:18)
doesn't change the fact that they know (23:15 - 23:20)
exactly what they're doing and they're (23:18 - 23:24)
ramping up their revenue by making the (23:20 - 23:27)
exclusivity behind a paywall (23:24 - 23:30)
so I will say though they do have a (23:27 - 23:33)
record solid record of bringing things (23:30 - 23:38)
back so I think yes if you're patient (23:33 - 23:44)
and understand that like you're in this (23:38 - 23:46)
game for the long haul because like (23:44 - 23:49)
Pokemon is a huge thing for me so it's (23:46 - 23:51)
like I don't care when I get it I know I (23:49 - 23:52)
will get it eventually (23:51 - 23:56)
yes great for I'm not in a rush so it's (23:52 - 23:59)
like okay I you know I I was lucky I got (23:56 - 24:00)
one it was one of the eggs that I had (23:59 - 24:03)
picked up sometime in the paid time (24:00 - 24:06)
period and I hatched it and it was oh my (24:03 - 24:09)
go cool I got it I could have like I (24:06 - 24:13)
miss all the swords of Justice I like (24:09 - 24:14)
all of them have had very reasons very (24:13 - 24:16)
good reasons to want to get them it (24:14 - 24:18)
didn't happen and I'm like well they'll (24:16 - 24:21)
be field research in seven months okay a (24:18 - 24:24)
good example though is who knows if (24:21 - 24:27)
we're ever getting one piece hat Pikachu (24:24 - 24:30)
back we never got black hat Pikachu back (24:27 - 24:32)
ever well (24:30 - 24:36)
ever that's not a thing right like we (24:32 - 24:39)
haven't gotten it back yet it but what (24:36 - 24:42)
we don't get it ever possible cuz I (24:39 - 24:44)
wonder is the Hat rotation Bobby they (24:42 - 24:45)
didn't the black hat wasn't in the Hat (24:44 - 24:48)
rotation or they did one Pikachu a week (24:45 - 24:50)
or day yeah that wasn't in the (24:48 - 24:53)
rotational it was triad in it yes it was (24:50 - 24:57)
okay the what was that one piece one (24:53 - 25:00)
piece yeah oh one piece and summer like (24:57 - 25:03)
summer hat yeah we're both in it I mean (25:00 - 25:05)
there's many reasons to bring the back (25:03 - 25:08)
right like we aren't there yet they (25:05 - 25:09)
could come back they could come back as (25:08 - 25:12)
a throwback event like yeah I mean I (25:09 - 25:14)
think Wurmple is definitely coming back (25:12 - 25:16)
I just the black hat Pikachu has never (25:14 - 25:20)
come back well as of this recording yeah (25:16 - 25:23)
I mean they know that people want these (25:20 - 25:25)
things right so when they're feeling the (25:23 - 25:29)
pinch or you know it's dead of winter (25:25 - 25:33)
and playtime is down guess what comes (25:29 - 25:35)
back maybe (25:33 - 25:37)
yeah we'll feed you well that the black (25:35 - 25:39)
hat Pikachu was the difference was is (25:37 - 25:42)
that that was I guess sort of like the (25:39 - 25:44)
one piece Pikachu but it was in (25:42 - 25:46)
collaboration with another like a street (25:44 - 25:48)
wear company if I remember correctly it (25:46 - 25:51)
was so it could even be more so like the (25:48 - 25:53)
next time that that company decides to (25:51 - 25:55)
do a collaboration with Pokemon right (25:53 - 25:57)
right yeah that again so that could be (25:55 - 25:59)
more based on when that company wants to (25:57 - 26:02)
do something and I'm sure the Pokemon (25:59 - 26:03)
company or any antic probably signed (26:02 - 26:05)
some deal of like once this hat is in (26:03 - 26:08)
the game we own it forever and we can (26:05 - 26:10)
own whatever we launched our this idea (26:08 - 26:12)
absolutely they would not they would be (26:10 - 26:14)
foolish to not do something like that (26:12 - 26:17)
yes yeah it was for like Pokemon go (26:14 - 26:21)
again it's a patience thing like I will (26:17 - 26:25)
get them eventually and I don't care win (26:21 - 26:28)
so I don't like pay for extra incubators (26:25 - 26:30)
like I guess I'm not gonna walk around (26:28 - 26:32)
with Wurmple party hat on my thing so (26:30 - 26:34)
people can see it the only time I show (26:32 - 26:36)
it is to take a picture of it and send (26:34 - 26:39)
it to you too you'll tweet it and then (26:36 - 26:42)
I'm done like that's my weird flex for (26:39 - 26:45)
the week I got this digital thing yeah I (26:42 - 26:47)
guess I do see the difference in that (26:45 - 26:49)
it's not keeping you from going forward (26:47 - 26:51)
in the game because who knows what (26:49 - 26:53)
forward is in Pokemon go anyway but and (26:51 - 26:55)
it is a patience thing i mean i'm not (26:53 - 26:57)
saying i entik is evil because they want (26:55 - 26:58)
to make money their business they have (26:57 - 27:00)
to make money or else they don't exist (26:58 - 27:03)
so they turn in a better way right and (27:00 - 27:07)
bringing stuff back is is something that (27:03 - 27:11)
is it's very good so it is it is a (27:07 - 27:14)
patience game and yeah you know like you (27:11 - 27:15)
said the swords are justice they'll come (27:14 - 27:16)
back they're gonna come back and (27:15 - 27:17)
research they're gonna come back like we (27:16 - 27:19)
got but Latios and latias coming back (27:17 - 27:21)
next weekend like these things come back (27:19 - 27:25)
multiple times so it's patience I will (27:21 - 27:27)
say this masters is also a patience game (27:25 - 27:31)
like you can wait until you get enough (27:27 - 27:32)
free gifts of all the things of the (27:31 - 27:36)
people give you but like that's months (27:32 - 27:39)
right now yeah I mean I guess so masters (27:36 - 27:43)
isn't slowing down in new stuff like it (27:39 - 27:46)
seems like Pokemon go isn't like slowing (27:43 - 27:49)
down but they're like treading water (27:46 - 27:52)
that we have all these jeanna Pokemon (27:49 - 27:55)
but it's too soon yeah so they're like a (27:52 - 27:57)
holding tank trip bed don't you Steve (27:55 - 28:00)
yeah hundred percent what how many (27:57 - 28:01)
species do we have now in Gen 5 like a (28:00 - 28:04)
hundred maybe we can talk about that (28:01 - 28:07)
when we get to put one go okay let me (28:04 - 28:10)
let me speaking of new stuff I'll finish (28:07 - 28:12)
this masters there's a new legendary (28:10 - 28:14)
event coming late January a new (28:12 - 28:16)
legendary event is coming later in (28:14 - 28:20)
January is a popular legendary Pokemon (28:16 - 28:23)
and in the screenshot it looks like (28:20 - 28:25)
there's some hice behind it i full (28:23 - 28:27)
disclosure I don't know what this is I'm (28:25 - 28:30)
gonna guess a --pqm though what other (28:27 - 28:32)
popular legendary ice pokemon would (28:30 - 28:33)
there be (28:32 - 28:36)
Articuno so you couldn't so here's the (28:33 - 28:38)
thing you have to think of (28:36 - 28:39)
when you're thinking of masters you (28:38 - 28:41)
can't think of just the Pokemon you have (28:39 - 28:43)
to think of the character I think of the (28:41 - 28:46)
character goes with so Lawrence the (28:43 - 28:51)
third I mean I will put an asterisk (28:46 - 28:56)
against that that they did makes saga (28:51 - 28:58)
leo (28:56 - 29:00)
no main character so they could do that (28:58 - 29:02)
again so when I was on the Pokemon (29:00 - 29:04)
master subreddit they they all assume (29:02 - 29:08)
it's kiram pairs with getss which i (29:04 - 29:12)
guess sure because giovani pairs with me (29:08 - 29:15)
too so like they're not like the DNA is (29:12 - 29:17)
not afraid or however whoever makes the (29:15 - 29:18)
decision of who's paired with who I'm (29:17 - 29:19)
not sure if it's DNA or the Pokemon (29:18 - 29:21)
company somebody's not afraid of giving (29:19 - 29:25)
you a bad guy to play as know if but (29:21 - 29:27)
would it not be cool everybody its (29:25 - 29:29)
colorist right yeah whole dress it would (29:27 - 29:31)
be paired in multiple games (29:29 - 29:33)
it wouldn't be n because n would be the (29:31 - 29:35)
Reshiram and Zekrom and would be both (29:33 - 29:38)
Reshiram and Zekrom right but it yeah it (29:35 - 29:40)
would be it would 100% be colorist over (29:38 - 29:42)
a hundred percent big colorist that's (29:40 - 29:44)
this guess this is a nobody chorus has (29:42 - 29:46)
appeared in many games I mean guess this (29:44 - 29:49)
is not a nobody guess this is a nobody (29:46 - 29:54)
do the sync pairs have can you have like (29:49 - 29:56)
Giovanni with Persian and then also GL (29:54 - 29:58)
him from you too well I could they could (29:56 - 30:02)
yeah they could they don't yes Rosa with (29:58 - 30:04)
Snivy right and then Rosa with Rosa was (30:02 - 30:05)
delibird (30:04 - 30:09)
what else do they do have understand (30:05 - 30:12)
that you level there for all intents and (30:09 - 30:15)
purposes two different people like you (30:12 - 30:18)
can't level Rosa with Snivy Oh (30:15 - 30:20)
any of that benefit to delibird (30:18 - 30:23)
Delawares is a separate track yeah yeah (30:20 - 30:25)
I know I understand that I just I was (30:23 - 30:28)
wondering if they were doing the same or (30:25 - 30:29)
do they do the other way around do they (30:28 - 30:33)
have delibird with two different or do (30:29 - 30:35)
they have any Pokemon the two different (30:33 - 30:37)
trainers nope No (30:35 - 30:40)
so like on the subreddit they haven't (30:37 - 30:41)
done weavile yet (30:40 - 30:44)
and so I think silver had a Weavile (30:41 - 30:47)
there's another person that has a weave (30:44 - 30:50)
oh what's his name the bad guy in Gen 4 (30:47 - 30:52)
Cyrus has a Weavile (30:50 - 30:54)
so everyone's like who's gonna get the (30:52 - 30:59)
wheel other people want to assume that (30:54 - 31:02)
silver should have got crobat because (30:59 - 31:04)
the whole point is like crobat evolve (31:02 - 31:06)
see friendship and it finally gets it (31:04 - 31:08)
and silver is a criminal but they gave (31:06 - 31:12)
crobat to Koga (31:08 - 31:14)
yeah they gave crobat to Koga well why (31:12 - 31:15)
didn't they give Koko than a month I'd (31:14 - 31:17)
understand yeah that seems like the (31:15 - 31:20)
better or the why did they get emotional (31:17 - 31:24)
every dose whoo Oh Janine (31:20 - 31:26)
she had area to us right yeah that makes (31:24 - 31:29)
sense does it not cuz area does my (31:26 - 31:31)
interest in Jen too and she was in Jen (31:29 - 31:33)
too (31:31 - 31:36)
ya know that make sense sure sure yeah (31:33 - 31:39)
what she's a poison ghibli to me (31:36 - 31:42)
the kogas that wasn't Elite 4 and Gen 2 (31:39 - 31:45)
and had a crow bat didn't he yeah but if (31:42 - 31:48)
yeah I mean I well like what else do you (31:45 - 31:50)
get silver if you're not giving silver (31:48 - 31:53)
crow bat or weavile (31:50 - 31:56)
or it can't have any of the starters cuz (31:53 - 31:58)
I already did that all the starters are (31:56 - 32:00)
used all right I'll gen 2 starters (31:58 - 32:00)
already in the game (32:00 - 32:03)
No then that just announced Ethan on (32:00 - 32:04)
Twitter like a week ago (32:03 - 32:09)
with oh yeah oh just kidding yeah they (32:04 - 32:09)
did (32:09 - 32:11)
has there been a pattern of how they've (32:09 - 32:16)
been pulling these no like really weird (32:11 - 32:18)
of what they end up giving silver so (32:16 - 32:22)
we've out there that has to be cyrus (32:18 - 32:25)
crobat there to give that to Koga (32:22 - 32:28)
none of the starters Gengar is saved for (32:25 - 32:31)
Agatha which makes sense for Agatha (32:28 - 32:34)
he had a Kadabra slash Alakazam (32:31 - 32:36)
but that's would you would guess that (32:34 - 32:38)
that would be Sabrina cuz Sabrina's not (32:36 - 32:39)
in the game yet right (32:38 - 32:41)
and I've what else do you give Sabrina (32:39 - 32:44)
besides Alakazam right right so you (32:41 - 32:47)
either give him Weavile or you give him (32:44 - 32:51)
magnus meg time or do you give him one (32:47 - 32:57)
of the legendaries from gen - hey he (32:51 - 32:58)
doesn't ever have one though right (32:57 - 33:02)
he does in the stadium games yeah I mean (32:58 - 33:03)
you could give him ho or lugia that's (33:02 - 33:07)
true I don't know I I don't know that I (33:03 - 33:09)
could not tell you the rhyme or reason (33:07 - 33:12)
when they introduce people like most of (33:09 - 33:14)
them makes sense the only one that (33:12 - 33:16)
doesn't really make sense is like Koga (33:14 - 33:18)
with crobat I guess unless you look at (33:16 - 33:20)
specifically his Elite Four but like (33:18 - 33:22)
Koga and venomoth kind of always went (33:20 - 33:23)
hand-in-hand (33:22 - 33:25)
who's got soul really Oh (33:23 - 33:28)
your main male character Oh which is (33:25 - 33:30)
well you would have thought they would (33:28 - 33:32)
have been produced Lily for that but (33:30 - 33:35)
that's fine I guess (33:32 - 33:36)
is that an issue it's just an (33:35 - 33:37)
interesting it's just like it's just (33:36 - 33:39)
thinking of who get who's getting what (33:37 - 33:41)
which is like one of the best parts of (33:39 - 33:43)
masters is like which I kind of get (33:41 - 33:45)
character gets put with which iconic (33:43 - 33:47)
Pokemon that's like the funnest part the (33:45 - 33:48)
most fun part of the game I think I (33:47 - 33:52)
don't disagree with covet Pro bet for (33:48 - 33:55)
Koga I mean I do agree that venomoth (33:52 - 33:57)
carried through two games but like he (33:55 - 34:00)
does have in most media (33:57 - 34:03)
to Crobat Crobat so yeah and some of (34:00 - 34:04)
them are easy like there's no way they (34:03 - 34:06)
don't introduce gladion with type nulls (34:04 - 34:10)
of a lie right like right there's no way (34:06 - 34:12)
like when they introduced Guzman the (34:10 - 34:14)
dudes gonna have a girl as a bug like (34:12 - 34:15)
some thought (34:14 - 34:18)
no one's debating that he's gonna have (34:15 - 34:22)
if you have a logo and Radek eight (34:18 - 34:25)
kessane even parked archetypes are there (34:22 - 34:28)
any other ones in the game like a Lola (34:25 - 34:30)
and how he has house right you alone (34:28 - 34:33)
aren't you and okay which makes sense (34:30 - 34:36)
for how I mean when they introduced if (34:33 - 34:39)
and when they introduced hop like the (34:36 - 34:40)
dudes gonna have woohoo right (34:39 - 34:44)
oh come on is Lulu yeah well the (34:40 - 34:46)
bump-out make it double right yeah they (34:44 - 34:49)
tend to go for the well no they could (34:46 - 34:51)
give him one Lu and then you have to go (34:49 - 34:55)
through the evolution so they they could (34:51 - 34:57)
have evolution that new then you evolve (34:55 - 35:00)
it to double I could see them doing that (34:57 - 35:02)
there's a nice type Pokemon coming at (35:00 - 35:05)
the end of February red it is it's gonna (35:02 - 35:06)
be us first write it write it is saying (35:05 - 35:10)
Hyrum and gets us I see is saying kiram (35:06 - 35:13)
and colorist I think it's caravan call (35:10 - 35:15)
risk urban chorus makes more sense I (35:13 - 35:17)
mean I have a is there an image (35:15 - 35:21)
the only image is on the there news page (35:17 - 35:24)
which I'm reading which has just the (35:21 - 35:28)
nurse joy in front of an iceberg why did (35:24 - 35:32)
we think it wasn't it was anything I (35:28 - 35:36)
didn't realize what the what the text (35:32 - 35:38)
said that is under there an unidentified (35:36 - 35:40)
dragon pokémon seems to have appeared (35:38 - 35:43)
near the glaciers recently oh yeah I'm (35:40 - 35:49)
sorry yes yeah oh yeah you guys okay how (35:43 - 35:52)
could I get my masters Laura that limits (35:49 - 35:55)
it down right cuz they carry one ice (35:52 - 36:00)
dragon right yes I think so (35:55 - 36:01)
I'm trying to think if there was one (36:00 - 36:03)
that was introduced in the new game but (36:01 - 36:07)
there's not not legendary no no here i'm (36:03 - 36:10)
kyra my CRM is the only ice dragon okay (36:07 - 36:12)
is there is there stretches there like a (36:10 - 36:16)
third character Cole wrists gets us the (36:12 - 36:20)
stretch could be in yeah that's that's (36:16 - 36:22)
really stretching you you like you (36:20 - 36:24)
absolutely saved you you release two (36:22 - 36:27)
ends one with thicker more threads right (36:24 - 36:30)
well you could release three ends (36:27 - 36:34)
theorem and then white caravan black (36:30 - 36:37)
Hyrum the fused forms cuz gets us never (36:34 - 36:39)
has control of Kirin throughout the (36:37 - 36:42)
entire games gaseous never has anything (36:39 - 36:49)
worthless like like gets us does have (36:42 - 36:52)
control of either zekrom or Reshiram at (36:49 - 36:56)
one point because no point he ever has (36:52 - 36:57)
control of kiram unless you're talking (36:56 - 37:01)
about the one kiram fuse i guess maybe (36:57 - 37:04)
if you're counting when kiram fuses with (37:01 - 37:09)
Zekrom a rush or a maybe but no horse is (37:04 - 37:11)
the one with pyram capture the airship (37:09 - 37:14)
shooting ice beams everywhere yeah i if (37:11 - 37:16)
they introduced gets as they introduced (37:14 - 37:18)
them with hi dragon right like hi dragon (37:16 - 37:21)
this was Pokemon yes and if they (37:18 - 37:24)
introduced alder they're gonna do it (37:21 - 37:25)
with boo fellahin (37:24 - 37:31)
yeah or maybe Volcarona I don't know (37:25 - 37:35)
they take that from will that's true all (37:31 - 37:37)

email you know it's funny cuz his game (39:08 - 39:15)
seemed like a hot mess like a month or (39:12 - 39:17)
two effort came out but they said they (39:15 - 39:18)
were this is what their six-month plan (39:17 - 39:22)
and hey they've stuck to it so yeah I (39:18 - 39:23)

mess it's still full of problems but I (39:23 - 39:30)
will say this they are attempting to (39:28 - 39:33)
correct it they are attempting to (39:30 - 39:33)
course-correct (39:33 - 39:37)
I don't know if it's enough like I think (39:33 - 39:41)
they may have lost a lot of non hardcore (39:37 - 39:44)
Pokemon players and I'm curious after (39:41 - 39:47)
the six months after a lot of this goes (39:44 - 39:50)
in what they're gonna do to try to lure (39:47 - 39:52)
people back like that exclusive pair (39:50 - 39:55)
that you get had better be amazing to (39:52 - 39:57)
pull people back in I don't even know at (39:55 - 39:58)
this point what would it be really (39:57 - 40:01)
could've like is it like Astin greninja (39:58 - 40:04)
like what do you is it Leon and (40:01 - 40:06)
Charizard is it only trainers like could (40:04 - 40:08)
there possibly ever be like a nurse joy (40:06 - 40:11)
in Chansey Chansey is already taken oh (40:08 - 40:14)
well chances taken by the I can't (40:11 - 40:15)
remember her name (40:14 - 40:16)
she's the one that like walks you (40:15 - 40:18)
through the forest when you first play (40:16 - 40:20)
Ruby and Sapphire right no not Ruby and (40:18 - 40:22)
Sapphire (40:20 - 40:24)
the one after that I'll hurl diamond (40:22 - 40:28)
pearl I can't remember her name but yeah (40:24 - 40:31)
she's the one that (40:28 - 40:33)
just begin with an M I think it believed (40:31 - 40:34)
begins with an M she was the one that (40:33 - 40:35)
walks you through the forest for the (40:34 - 40:36)
first time and then you have a bunch of (40:35 - 40:38)
double battles and after every battle (40:36 - 40:43)
she she heals you gotcha uh so she has (40:38 - 40:46)
Chauncey so she's like not a she's not (40:43 - 40:47)
like an actual I mean she's a trainer (40:46 - 40:50)
obviously but she's not like a gym (40:47 - 40:53)
leader or a main story character (40:50 - 40:56)
marlis got the arcanite look I've pulled (40:53 - 41:00)
way too many Marlies oh don't okay I (40:56 - 41:03)
just never mind that but how about give (41:00 - 41:08)
us the barkeep in indeedy oh I don't (41:03 - 41:09)
think they've done anything like that (41:08 - 41:12)
yet I guess they don't look no there's (41:09 - 41:15)
so many characters they haven't pulled a (41:12 - 41:17)
specifically TV show character yet like (41:15 - 41:21)
a Cheryl Cheryl of course they're (41:17 - 41:24)
everyone's favorite Cheryl or my (41:21 - 41:27)
favorite Cheryl hmm I'm trying to think (41:24 - 41:29)
if a Charizard isn't in the game (41:27 - 41:32)
currently I don't think well then it (41:29 - 41:34)
comes with Leon at some point in the (41:32 - 41:36)
future well they also haven't had read (41:34 - 41:37)
yet either but they've had it has maybe (41:36 - 41:40)
it's red because it could be red as well (41:37 - 41:43)
who do they put red with pikas like (41:40 - 41:45)
peaches already in it charizard (41:43 - 41:46)
blastoise (41:45 - 41:48)
know cuz you save chars are for Leon (41:46 - 41:51)
yeah what everybody loves Charizard and (41:48 - 41:54)
red is hey red (41:51 - 41:56)
yabba Leon's cooler than red let's be (41:54 - 42:00)
honest here I do like Leon a lot you're (41:56 - 42:00)
right (42:00 - 42:04)
in one of their tweets from back in July (42:00 - 42:08)
Greg's gizzard they didn't have (42:04 - 42:11)
introducing sync pair red and Charizard (42:08 - 42:13)
you'll meet more legends like him and (42:11 - 42:15)
I'm pretty sure they're not in the game (42:13 - 42:18)
no red and tartar are in the game I mean (42:15 - 42:20)
they can go to Charizard but they (42:18 - 42:23)
announced that they were in the game (42:20 - 42:27)
back in July so this has to be what (42:23 - 42:30)
they're putting in right this has to be (42:27 - 42:32)
the pair that you're getting for free (42:30 - 42:35)
they already announced it before the (42:32 - 42:37)
game launched (42:35 - 42:41)

encounter Giganta max colossal and (46:17 - 46:22)
Giganta max flap 'el while pokemon (46:19 - 46:24)
shield players you were more likely to (46:22 - 46:27)
encounter Giganta max Lapras and Giganta (46:24 - 46:31)
max appleton play both players are more (46:27 - 46:33)
likely to encounter Giganta max l creme (46:31 - 46:38)
a in both games I have somebody else (46:33 - 46:42)
Cryme that started on january 9th they (46:38 - 46:44)
have said that this goes until early (46:42 - 46:46)
February then I'm an exact date here on (46:44 - 46:50)
Pokemon calm but they have rotated the (46:46 - 46:53)
max raids I guess you could probably (46:50 - 46:55)
assume they're gonna rotate them again (46:53 - 46:59)
early February 14th I'll love dis crazy (46:55 - 47:01)
eye (46:59 - 47:04)
when this podcast goes up I will (47:01 - 47:06)
actually have a pretty handy graphic on (47:04 - 47:08)
social media whether that's like Twitter (47:06 - 47:12)
or slack or Instagram where if you're (47:08 - 47:13)
looking for specific (47:12 - 47:16)
alch Remy I've they actually do appear (47:13 - 47:19)
only in specific dem dens for example if (47:16 - 47:21)
you wanted the salted alfc Remy thing (47:19 - 47:23)
off the top of my head that is only (47:21 - 47:25)
five-star dens specifically in sword if (47:23 - 47:27)
you care about collecting all the (47:25 - 47:30)
flavours they are only strawberry but (47:27 - 47:33)
there are nine there are seven treats (47:30 - 47:36)
and there are nine flavors for every (47:33 - 47:38)
treat so like strawberry salted (47:36 - 47:42)
strawberry with Ruby swirl strawberry (47:38 - 47:44)
with rainbow swirl there's like clover (47:42 - 47:48)
and star but there's 63 what versions of (47:44 - 47:52)
them and then if you wanted the shinies (47:48 - 47:55)
with the treats that's another seven so (47:52 - 47:59)
altogether there are 70 but if you don't (47:55 - 48:00)
care about Chinese or 63 (47:59 - 48:02)
two of the Suites aren't in the game (48:00 - 48:06)
currently which is the ribbon suite and (48:02 - 48:09)
the star suite so keep that in mind (48:06 - 48:11)
don't know if that's like expansion past (48:09 - 48:15)
territory or what but those two suites (48:11 - 48:17)
are currently available in the game you (48:15 - 48:18)
get them at the top of the fighting (48:17 - 48:19)
dungeon (48:18 - 48:22)
yeah maybe based on your choices you'll (48:19 - 48:25)
get one and one only what we did what we (48:22 - 48:28)
didn't say last week we just kind of (48:25 - 48:29)
glossed over it I guess is if you don't (48:28 - 48:33)
decide to buy the expansion pass and (48:29 - 48:39)
somebody is doing a Slowking raid in the (48:33 - 48:42)
new area and the island of style of (48:39 - 48:46)
steel or whatever isle of armor genome (48:42 - 48:51)
is do if somebody is doing a dynamite (48:46 - 48:53)
said that you definitely talked about (48:51 - 48:55)
this loss who did we oh I was just gonna (48:53 - 48:58)
say if somebody's doing a Slowbro in the (48:55 - 48:59)
island of armor and you didn't buy the (48:58 - 49:02)
expansion you can still join in you (48:59 - 49:04)
don't have to purchase the expansion to (49:02 - 49:07)
do raids with people who do have the (49:04 - 49:08)
expansion they just have to host it (49:07 - 49:10)
which is awesome (49:08 - 49:14)
that's another another great thing that (49:10 - 49:19)
they did to allow that I will say for (49:14 - 49:23)
the the max raid stuff Steve your tip (49:19 - 49:27)
that you gave will last week (49:23 - 49:29)
his friends weren't able to connect to (49:27 - 49:32)
those magic heart braids and they didn't (49:29 - 49:35)
have Nintendo online and then you (49:32 - 49:39)
mentioned if you get wild area news (49:35 - 49:41)
it connects your switch to the internet (49:39 - 49:44)
and then that allows you to it like (49:41 - 49:46)
downloads the new raids from the server (49:44 - 49:48)
or whatever yeah that works perfectly a (49:46 - 49:51)
friend of mine didn't have what we were (49:48 - 49:52)
trying to figure that out a couple weeks (49:51 - 49:55)
ago why he couldn't see the promoted (49:52 - 49:57)
raids and I assumed it was because they (49:55 - 49:58)
were promoted and it was something he (49:57 - 50:00)
wasn't he hadn't downloaded somehow but (49:58 - 50:02)
that's exactly what work she doesn't (50:00 - 50:04)
have a Nintendo online the night that (50:02 - 50:06)
the podcast came out I listened to it I (50:04 - 50:08)
told him that and then he went and got (50:06 - 50:11)
the wild area news and then no problem (50:08 - 50:13)
he was raiding promoted raids without (50:11 - 50:15)
heating Nintendo homeland we can help (50:13 - 50:19)
people yeah so ever for the first time (50:15 - 50:21)
this podcast is solved with a least one (50:19 - 50:24)
problem we created 50 but we solved one (50:21 - 50:28)
there was so the there was an event for (50:24 - 50:31)
like extra dream balls in front balls (50:28 - 50:34)
and like love balls and stuff where you (50:31 - 50:36)
would enter codes and I think that was (50:34 - 50:37)
maybe like a month ago we talked about (50:36 - 50:39)
that in this podcast and I said you (50:37 - 50:41)
needed Nintendo online for that I was (50:39 - 50:42)
mistaken (50:41 - 50:47)
you need a my Nintendo account in order (50:42 - 50:50)
to redeem those let me try to explain (50:47 - 50:53)
this for I mean I'm sure most people (50:50 - 50:55)
have it but when you create your account (50:53 - 50:59)
on your switch you then link it to a (50:55 - 51:02)
Nintendo account which keeps track of (50:59 - 51:04)
your purchase history if you decide to (51:02 - 51:06)
buy like a digital game right (51:04 - 51:09)
so if you decide to buy Mario Odyssey (51:06 - 51:11)
you need some sort of account link to (51:09 - 51:13)
that profile to then verify that game (51:11 - 51:16)
purchase as well as you know giving (51:13 - 51:17)
Nintendo your information to track you (51:16 - 51:22)
your birthday that stuff so when I made (51:17 - 51:23)
a new account because I wanted to (51:22 - 51:26)
speedrun pokemon sword (51:23 - 51:29)
I didn't link it to anything so when I (51:26 - 51:32)
went to enter the code for the baseball (51:29 - 51:36)
the fastball in the lower ball (51:32 - 51:40)
it said that I needed to have my mind (51:36 - 51:42)
attend to account linked in order to get (51:40 - 51:45)
it which I assumed at the time was (51:42 - 51:49)
Nintendo online but if you just link an (51:45 - 51:53)
email to my Nintendo and then link it to (51:49 - 51:55)
that account you can then download those (51:53 - 51:56)
things for free that would be the same (51:55 - 52:01)
for the Giganta maxed meows that you (51:56 - 52:03)
needed you just need some sort of (52:01 - 52:06)
Nintendo account an email in order to (52:03 - 52:08)
get any of the mystery gifts but you (52:06 - 52:10)
don't need to you don't need to be (52:08 - 52:13)
paying $25 a year for a Nintendo (52:10 - 52:14)
online for the mystery gifts but you do (52:13 - 52:17)
need a little email linked to the (52:14 - 52:20)
account so there that was that was the (52:17 - 52:23)
mess up which is kind of annoying if (52:20 - 52:25)
you're just using an account to speedrun (52:23 - 52:27)
and you plan on deleting the account (52:25 - 52:32)
you're done did you if you were going to (52:27 - 52:34)
delete it out well you know you put the (52:32 - 52:35)
pokeballs on the pokémon you trade them (52:34 - 52:40)
out then you delete it oh so then you (52:35 - 52:43)
can cheater really yeah I did six and a (52:40 - 52:45)
half hours of work to get that master (52:43 - 52:46)
ball you better believe I'm moving them (52:45 - 52:50)
back to my main game six and a half (52:46 - 52:53)
hours some of us played for 40 hours (52:50 - 52:57)
before we weren't skipping around with (52:53 - 53:00)
some a high-level Pokemon we hacked in (52:57 - 53:04)
with our game shark speaking of wasting (53:00 - 53:07)
hours Latios and latias sit back in the (53:04 - 53:10)
special pencils weakened (53:07 - 53:14)
oh poor lot he has a lot yes one of them (53:10 - 53:17)
is good right one of them is yes oh well (53:14 - 53:21)
I'm not sure any secrets there these (53:17 - 53:24)
Aeon Pokemon are both the dragon and (53:21 - 53:25)
psychic types so it's best to bring (53:24 - 53:28)
other dragon-type pokémon like Rayquaza (53:25 - 53:31)
or dialga they're also weak to ice bug (53:28 - 53:34)
ghosts dark and fairy so we recommend (53:31 - 53:36)
you bringing Tyranitar togekiss or (53:34 - 53:39)
Mamoswine they will be appearing Friday (53:36 - 53:43)
January 24th to Monday January 27th for (53:39 - 53:47)
a special raid event weekend (53:43 - 53:48)
I mean this is the future of Pokemon go (53:47 - 53:50)
every weekend they were going to bring (53:48 - 53:52)
back so well once everything's released (53:50 - 53:55)
there will be a point in time when the (53:52 - 53:58)
antic will get to the end and then they (53:55 - 54:00)
will have to put hats on everything and (53:58 - 54:03)
bring back bring back man come on we've (54:00 - 54:08)
all caught count for Ash hat latias just (54:03 - 54:09)
you and me both (54:08 - 54:13)
and then speaking of (54:09 - 54:16)
to the end of the line more Pokemon (54:13 - 54:17)
originally discovered in the you know of (54:16 - 54:20)
a region and trade evolution Pokemon are (54:17 - 54:22)
being added Bobby do you want to explain (54:20 - 54:24)
this trade evolution this is something (54:22 - 54:26)
that probably should have been in the (54:24 - 54:27)
game since day one (54:26 - 54:30)
but God bless their hearts Nance I (54:27 - 54:34)
couldn't figure it out I guess she's not (54:30 - 54:38)
in a partnership with nan tech not yet (54:34 - 54:42)
you'll notice that tone will change I'm (54:38 - 54:45)
so proud of Niantic finally coming (54:42 - 54:47)
forward and figuring out a masterful way (54:45 - 54:52)
to have these bulk Irma yeah so trade (54:47 - 54:57)
Evo's basically there are I believe it (54:52 - 55:01)
only affects the four Jen one Pokemon (54:57 - 55:04)
that back in red and blue were the ones (55:01 - 55:07)
who needed to trade to evolve so you got (55:04 - 55:12)
gravel ur Machoke Kadabra and hunter (55:07 - 55:14)
want and there and then some Gen 5 (55:12 - 55:17)
Pokemon that they just released as well (55:14 - 55:20)
have the ability to have a trade (55:17 - 55:24)
evolution so how it works is you can (55:20 - 55:27)
still use candy to evolve your Pokemon (55:24 - 55:30)
will take Machamp for example you can (55:27 - 55:33)
still use a hundred candy to evolve much (55:30 - 55:36)
oak to Machamp but if the Machoke you (55:33 - 55:38)
have has been traded to you from another (55:36 - 55:41)
trainer the evolution from the choke to (55:38 - 55:43)
Machamp the always making that build of (55:41 - 55:46)
candy hey you never know it's trading (55:43 - 55:50)
matures you never know who um so that (55:46 - 55:53)
that there is no candy to evolve a (55:50 - 55:56)
traded Machoke to Machamp the catch here (55:53 - 55:58)
is that obviously you cannot trade your (55:56 - 56:02)
Pokemon back to yourself so your trade (55:58 - 56:05)
is trade ya you're trading them for your (56:02 - 56:05)
pokedex (56:05 - 56:08)
exactly exactly you're trading away the (56:05 - 56:10)
Machoke you have and I know we only we (56:08 - 56:11)
all only have one Machoke so be careful (56:10 - 56:15)
but yeah so that it takes the candy (56:11 - 56:18)
situation away to evolve it to Machamp (56:15 - 56:21)
now what they've done for the Gen 5 ones (56:18 - 56:22)
I can't remember off the top of my head (56:21 - 56:26)
have in the eyes it is allowed bold or (56:22 - 56:27)
girder (56:26 - 56:32)
she'll MIT and Hera blast okay so those (56:27 - 56:35)
all at least I know for sure bull door (56:32 - 56:40)
and and girder are two hundred candy to (56:35 - 56:43)
evolve and then but if you trade them (56:40 - 56:46)
than they are zero candy yeah care (56:43 - 56:48)
blossom another thing and there they say (56:46 - 56:50)
okay so feel I really trying to (56:48 - 56:53)
obviously push the trade Evo's for those (56:50 - 56:55)
but the the downside is is that when you (56:53 - 56:59)
get like timber is in raids right now (56:55 - 57:00)
it's only in raids and eggs (56:59 - 57:02)
you can't find timber in the wild so (57:00 - 57:04)
that means when you get a timber it's (57:02 - 57:07)
gonna have at least somewhat good Ivy's (57:04 - 57:09)
but it doesn't really matter cuz you (57:07 - 57:11)
need to trade it to evolve it to its (57:09 - 57:13)
final stage I guess in that case like (57:11 - 57:15)
II's don't really matter if that's what (57:13 - 57:16)
you're going for (57:15 - 57:18)
um you maybe want to be lucky friends (57:16 - 57:20)
with someone before you make those (57:18 - 57:21)
trades if you want something with good (57:20 - 57:24)
Ivy's or you just will have to grind out (57:21 - 57:25)
kind it out and get the two hundred (57:24 - 57:28)
candy okay if we just spent 45 minutes (57:25 - 57:30)
talking about a game that had come who (57:28 - 57:34)
required a lot of grind and really not (57:30 - 57:37)
DNA's fault as somebody who might be in (57:34 - 57:39)
the deep deep pockets of DNA we could (57:37 - 57:42)
maybe say all these games have great (57:39 - 57:45)
that's true this is true but I can walk (57:42 - 57:47)
with a thing and just earn candy that's (57:45 - 57:49)
true I mean in also in all seriousness I (57:47 - 57:53)
do like the trade evolution stuff I (57:49 - 57:55)
think it's a really cool mechanic that (57:53 - 57:59)
rewards you for going outside and (57:55 - 58:01)
meeting other people I think it's cool (57:59 - 58:03)
it's interesting I the fact that you (58:01 - 58:07)
can't trade it back is like now just (58:03 - 58:09)
trade boulder for Boulder who cares at (58:07 - 58:11)
that point right I mean that's the thing (58:09 - 58:15)
is I loved that ball door thank you I (58:11 - 58:20)
walked with that bowled over point to (58:15 - 58:23)
kilometer don't think anyone in history (58:20 - 58:25)
Pokemon go has ever been walking with a (58:23 - 58:29)
girder look we know somebody who is (58:25 - 58:30)
walking with the chinks so never say (58:29 - 58:31)
never (58:30 - 58:35)
that's picture let's keep the parameters (58:31 - 58:37)
open here a little bit lower here in (58:35 - 58:39)
case you didn't know about shell MIT and (58:37 - 58:40)
Kara (58:39 - 58:44)
she'll MIT the one with the helmet the (58:40 - 58:46)
one with the night helmet with a helmet (58:44 - 58:47)
yeah (58:46 - 58:51)
it becomes I'll sell gore the ninja and (58:47 - 58:54)
then Kara blasts the little tick looking (58:51 - 58:59)
bug becomes the the night with the Lance (58:54 - 59:03)
ass Cavalier and so you maybe would (58:59 - 59:06)
think like this is well this is like Gen (59:03 - 59:08)
5 lore so maybe somebody didn't legend 5 (59:06 - 59:09)
and they just started listening the show (59:08 - 59:11)
like why did this happen the reason is (59:09 - 59:14)
because in the games you do have to (59:11 - 59:16)
specifically trade Cara blasts and (59:14 - 59:19)
she'll met with each other to evolve (59:16 - 59:22)
unlike other evolutions like bull door (59:19 - 59:24)
as long as you trade the bull door (59:22 - 59:26)
doesn't matter what you receive as long (59:24 - 59:28)
as you trade it it will evolve for Cara (59:26 - 59:29)
blessing shell mitt you specifically (59:28 - 59:31)
have to trade those two and in the trade (59:29 - 59:35)
process the lower is the cour the Cara (59:31 - 59:38)
blast steals the helmet during the trade (59:35 - 59:41)
and becomes a scav Alire because it's (59:38 - 59:43)
told the helmet and because shellman no (59:41 - 59:45)
longer has the helmet it becomes lean (59:43 - 59:47)
and thin and becomes very fast which (59:45 - 59:51)
makes it a sell Gore so there's the lore (59:47 - 59:53)
about those two Pokemon there is a fan (59:51 - 59:55)
theory that that was supposed to happen (59:53 - 60:00)
between Machoke & Gravel er that's why (59:55 - 60:03)
Machoke has two arms in Machamp has four (60:00 - 60:05)
arms and gravel ER has four arms but (60:03 - 60:07)
when it involves two golem it has two (60:05 - 60:11)
arms because the mud choke steals the (60:07 - 60:17)
arms but that's what hey this is it - (60:11 - 60:20)
its body oh hey Sarge you got there hey (60:17 - 60:23)
strong it just rips the two arms long (60:20 - 60:26)
gravel and Traveller and attaches the (60:23 - 60:32)
rocky stumps to its back that's like (60:26 - 60:33)
that's more of a Fame theory the one I (60:32 - 60:35)
told you about the car of lines in the (60:33 - 60:38)
show but is true that's true (60:35 - 60:53)
this nightmare sauce of choke jabbing (60:38 - 60:55)
that arms back into its body if you just (60:53 - 60:59)
walk up nice herbs you got there shame (60:55 - 61:02)
some happened to him in evolution if you (60:59 - 61:03)
want to be that person that corrects (61:02 - 61:08)
people a trades I do it is calm kelder (61:03 - 61:12)
not Conkeldurr which is the wrong way (61:08 - 61:14)
that I've said for many years con Cal (61:12 - 61:17)
there is how you say it as you concrete (61:14 - 61:18)
do you wanna if you want to be that (61:17 - 61:24)
person also there will be another trade (61:18 - 61:26)
evolution coming in the future you would (61:24 - 61:29)
assume now that this mechanic is in the (61:26 - 61:32)
game and that would be for phantom right (61:29 - 61:33)
there's probably another one I don't (61:32 - 61:35)
think I can't remember it but hands hump (61:33 - 61:37)
is the other must be traded to evolve (61:35 - 61:39)
Pokemon I like the way they did this (61:37 - 61:43)
gives the opportunity to trade but if (61:39 - 61:46)
you don't have anyone to trade with if (61:43 - 61:47)
you were just a solo player who likes it (61:46 - 61:51)
just find it out and play alone then you (61:47 - 61:52)
still have the opportunity to evolve but (61:51 - 61:54)
it's not taking that away from you (61:52 - 61:55)

harder since it's 200 candy to get them (61:55 - 62:02)

disclosure in the pockets of big bass : (64:56 - 65:03)
you are eastern hemisphere red striped (64:59 - 65:06)
for masculine western hemisphere blue (65:03 - 65:09)
stripe form bass : have you got Steve (65:06 - 65:12)
zero I see them on my radio you know (65:09 - 65:14)
what we've talked about this before this (65:12 - 65:19)
game the antic I will provide you my (65:14 - 65:20)
email it may be in your pocket (65:19 - 65:25)
this game punishes you for catching (65:20 - 65:28)
pokémon let's give you an example when (65:25 - 65:32)
Bobby and I met and the Wolves howled in (65:28 - 65:40)
the moonshine when we met we used a non (65:32 - 65:45)
Pokemon go players phone to direct us to (65:40 - 65:49)
Pokemon because the game punished us for (65:45 - 65:51)
collecting lip we caught a liquid so it (65:49 - 65:53)
punished us and it never showed us where (65:51 - 65:56)
lit wick was but because our friend (65:53 - 65:59)
Brooke refused to play pokemon go yet (65:56 - 66:02)
had it installed on her phone it would (65:59 - 66:04)
always show us where the net the next (66:02 - 66:08)
lit lick was so every night we would ask (66:04 - 66:10)
her to open the game it would say the (66:08 - 66:13)
lit wick was at that stop Bobby and I (66:10 - 66:16)
and crew would walk to that stop she was (66:13 - 66:19)
no longer she was her attention span of (66:16 - 66:21)
Pokemon go was opening it for us to see (66:19 - 66:23)
and then she would close it and play (66:21 - 66:24)
moot play other games we'd get to the (66:23 - 66:26)
stop we catch the little ik we would (66:24 - 66:28)
then say Brooke can you open your game (66:26 - 66:30)
again we need to see the next lit wick (66:28 - 66:33)
and or other pokemon we need to catch (66:30 - 66:35)
and she would point us to the nuts lit (66:33 - 66:36)
wick (66:35 - 66:38)
but once you if you don't have that (66:36 - 66:41)
person you'll never know where it is (66:38 - 66:44)
so every night right now I'm looking at (66:41 - 66:48)
it every night near this Cemetery (66:44 - 66:51)
I see a furrow he's out there patrolling (66:48 - 66:56)
that cemetery every night I see him he's (66:51 - 67:00)
stomping on graves he's punching trees I (66:56 - 67:05)
know what he's doing what do you expect (67:00 - 67:09)
I see him out there every night but I (67:05 - 67:12)
know the minute I catch that throw I'll (67:09 - 67:15)
never know what he's doing I have tabs (67:12 - 67:20)
on the throw yeah but knee antic will (67:15 - 67:21)
punish me once I catch him I'll never (67:20 - 67:23)
know that he's out there kicking over (67:21 - 67:27)
gravestones if I catch him that's true (67:23 - 67:30)
they fix that so I'm on constant bass : (67:27 - 67:33)
control I know where they all are at all (67:30 - 67:35)
times but if I catch them then I don't I (67:33 - 67:37)
don't know what died no no trouble (67:35 - 67:38)
they're causing in the northern then the (67:37 - 67:41)
in the eastern hemisphere that's where (67:38 - 67:44)
we are once you've caught your assigned (67:41 - 67:46)
vascular the rest of them are no longer (67:44 - 67:50)
your problem you have picked up the one (67:46 - 67:52)
meant for you and you are in control of (67:50 - 67:55)
what that one does don't worry about the (67:52 - 67:57)
rest of the world they will deal with (67:55 - 68:00)
the other basket you find the one that (67:57 - 68:02)
matches your hurt Steve (68:00 - 68:04)
this isn't build-a-bear Greg when I go (68:02 - 68:06)
in there and stuff in a basket full of (68:04 - 68:11)
cotton this is what Danzig needs to do (68:06 - 68:14)
they need to have a like a radar feature (68:11 - 68:16)
because clearly it's in the game I can (68:14 - 68:17)
see the throw I always know where the (68:16 - 68:20)
throw is this catch the throw (68:17 - 68:22)
I'm not gonna throw guessed catch that (68:20 - 68:24)
throw have to be on a throw Patrol why (68:22 - 68:26)
is it hanging around you it clearly (68:24 - 68:28)
wants to join your team there needs to (68:26 - 68:31)
be a radar feature in the game where I (68:28 - 68:36)
can select like five pokemon and like (68:31 - 68:42)
ponary sigilyph Eevee Pikachu and throw (68:36 - 68:45)
and they are prioritized on my radar (68:42 - 68:47)
because I shouldn't have to depend on (68:45 - 68:49)
somebody who doesn't play the game to be (68:47 - 68:52)
like direct me like that I wasn't (68:49 - 68:54)
exaggerating with the story with Bobby (68:52 - 68:55)
and I hmm (68:54 - 68:57)
we went from lit wick to lit wick for (68:55 - 69:01)
like three hours they were out there (68:57 - 69:01)
so like I see a throw every single night (69:01 - 69:08)
on my radar without fail but I will (69:05 - 69:10)
probably never see another throw again (69:08 - 69:13)
on my radar once I catch it they need to (69:10 - 69:15)
add (69:13 - 69:17)
the habitat feature to the Pokedex like (69:15 - 69:20)
we haven't other games yeah I mean I (69:17 - 69:22)
don't know yeah I guess I mean what why (69:20 - 69:26)
do you okay so what that's just (69:22 - 69:27)
complicated for you antic that's what (69:26 - 69:29)
I'm drew dumb dumbing it down to let me (69:27 - 69:31)
sleep like five Pokemon the Pokedex they (69:29 - 69:34)
like have more priority on the radar why (69:31 - 69:38)
do you want to like hunt them down after (69:34 - 69:40)
you have the one ah Shani hunting or (69:38 - 69:42)
you're looking like I like right now I (69:40 - 69:45)
would probably select crabby just (69:42 - 69:47)
because I would like it good crabby and (69:45 - 69:50)
I would like more crabby candy so even (69:47 - 69:52)
though I why do i do want china crabby I (69:50 - 69:55)
think shiny crab he's great but crabby (69:52 - 69:58)
is one of the best water-type attackers (69:55 - 70:01)
in the game still I think because crime (69:58 - 70:05)
cameras very good yeah so it'd be nice (70:01 - 70:07)
to be like okay (70:05 - 70:11)
back up I would go out of my way like if (70:07 - 70:13)
I was downtown and it wasn't negative (70:11 - 70:15)
eight degrees and it was a nice day I (70:13 - 70:19)
would be as a player willing to walk (70:15 - 70:22)
farther if I knew a Pokemon I wanted was (70:19 - 70:26)
there so if I selected crabby and even (70:22 - 70:27)
though I have a million Crabbie's and I (70:26 - 70:30)
knew it was you know a quarter of a mile (70:27 - 70:34)
away that's us distance here Canadians I (70:30 - 70:36)
would walk that quarter of a mile (70:34 - 70:39)
because I know that a Pokemon I want is (70:36 - 70:40)
over there instead of just walking (70:39 - 70:42)
aimlessly being like well I hope (70:40 - 70:43)
something good is about to pop up and (70:42 - 70:47)
that is still exciting but if I'm (70:43 - 70:49)
specifically trying to grind out a (70:47 - 70:51)
specific Pokemon case-in-point people (70:49 - 70:53)
that might not have anyone to trade with (70:51 - 70:57)
and that would want maybe calm it (70:53 - 70:59)
like once they catch that shell mitt (70:57 - 71:01)
it's going to be significantly harder to (70:59 - 71:04)
find more shell myths yeah I mean I (71:01 - 71:07)
agree (71:04 - 71:11)
I just don't know I'm hesitantly agree (71:07 - 71:13)
uh-huh (71:11 - 71:16)
I just don't know (71:13 - 71:19)
I mean that's I guess that (71:16 - 71:21)
that's so different I guess from all the (71:19 - 71:23)
other games so you can't really compare (71:21 - 71:25)
to anything else (71:23 - 71:26)
it's like when you get like a peed of (71:25 - 71:28)
like here's here's another good example (71:26 - 71:31)
back when the Gen 5 dropped they dropped (71:28 - 71:34)
both Peeta I am tranquil and so if you (71:31 - 71:36)
if you it was very easy to get like five (71:34 - 71:39)
P dubs right there were everywhere bless (71:36 - 71:42)
their souls and soon as you got five you (71:39 - 71:44)
could evolve it and get tranquil but (71:42 - 71:46)
then tranquil got knocked off your radar (71:44 - 71:49)
so I would always see silhouettes of (71:46 - 71:51)
tranquil around because I never evolved (71:49 - 71:54)
my P dove and so that's what like the (71:51 - 71:57)
same with like Asha wat and Tepig and (71:54 - 72:00)
the third one that no one likes there's (71:57 - 72:03)
no point of evolving them because (72:00 - 72:05)
eventually I don't I don't think their (72:03 - 72:08)
evolutions are in the wild but they are (72:05 - 72:11)
okay they are the second tier is right (72:08 - 72:14)
so like if I want to do wat or pignite (72:11 - 72:19)
if I evolve my Tepig I get punished for (72:14 - 72:21)
that because I will never the like I (72:19 - 72:24)
will never see a wild a pig knight on (72:21 - 72:26)
the radar because now it's registered (72:24 - 72:27)
and now it doesn't prioritize it on my (72:26 - 72:31)
radar yeah I I don't know punishes (72:27 - 72:33)
punishes we aren't punished is the right (72:31 - 72:35)
word though because it's not you're (72:33 - 72:37)
telling me if you weren't laying in bed (72:35 - 72:40)
at like 11:00 p.m. and a big night (72:37 - 72:41)
silhouette popped up and you didn't have (72:40 - 72:43)
it you'd be like I had some it's only (72:41 - 72:45)
it's it's only like the stop sign down (72:43 - 72:46)
the street I'll go get it (72:45 - 72:48)
because that's exciting because you (72:46 - 72:50)
don't have it I definitely did that (72:48 - 72:52)
event there okay well I can't talk for (72:50 - 72:54)
you guys but I definitely did that with (72:52 - 72:57)
a Kara blast the other day I was on the (72:54 - 72:59)
it was at the polka stop down the street (72:57 - 73:02)
and I was sitting there with you know we (72:59 - 73:03)
were with my (73:02 - 73:04)
wife and son and I was like okay I gotta (73:03 - 73:08)
go the black bull right on the radar is (73:04 - 73:10)
the most exciting thing that Pokemon has (73:08 - 73:13)
ever brought - you're not you're not (73:10 - 73:15)
wrong every time a new gen comes out I (73:13 - 73:15)
tweet (73:15 - 73:17)
I love the silhouettes like it's it's (73:15 - 73:20)
the best but you're out of silhouettes (73:17 - 73:23)
that it just shows you the closest right (73:20 - 73:25)
or does it just shows you the closest it (73:23 - 73:27)
shows you the closest at the Polka stops (73:25 - 73:29)
that are available already other one (73:27 - 73:31)
that you can see on your map if you (73:29 - 73:33)
don't have the Pokemon it will go a (73:31 - 73:35)
little bit farther past that true yeah (73:33 - 73:38)
you'll usually it'll - many times (73:35 - 73:42)
Oh Archon is on nearby and then it's (73:38 - 73:44)
like off the map you can't even see the (73:42 - 73:46)
streets anymore (73:44 - 73:48)
how is that helpful what do you mean (73:46 - 73:51)
like if it's way off the map well you (73:48 - 73:53)
know what direction it is then once you (73:51 - 73:54)
get start getting closer to it then (73:53 - 73:57)
obviously all things show up all the (73:54 - 73:58)
liquids we were going for that night (73:57 - 74:01)
were pretty far away from each other but (73:58 - 74:03)
we got to everyone within so like I (74:01 - 74:06)
think a Pokemon last 20 minutes right on (74:03 - 74:09)
a stop before there's one 15 30 or 45 (74:06 - 74:12)
it's it's different based on the species (74:09 - 74:15)
I think oh I didn't know that but every (74:12 - 74:17)
lick we got to we got to in time except (74:15 - 74:19)
for that first one but we got distracted (74:17 - 74:24)
by a Lapras yes the lappers distracted (74:19 - 74:27)
everyone so when we got to lit like a (74:24 - 74:28)
despawn but a new one spawned so (74:27 - 74:31)
everyone after that we got to within the (74:28 - 74:33)
20 minutes and they were pretty far away (74:31 - 74:35)
from each other but at least we knew (74:33 - 74:36)
which direction to walk in and where to (74:35 - 74:38)
go right it at least points you in the (74:36 - 74:40)
right direction and the the here's the (74:38 - 74:43)
thing so I guess it's can you could (74:40 - 74:46)
consider it being punished because the (74:43 - 74:48)
feature is there but I think that the (74:46 - 74:51)
idea is that the basic feature of the (74:48 - 74:52)
game is that it just shows you what's (74:51 - 74:55)
close and that it's just helping you if (74:52 - 74:56)
you don't have it yet right so like (74:55 - 74:58)
you're getting a little extra if you (74:56 - 75:02)
don't have it versus like I don't know I (74:58 - 75:07)
feel like being punished is a bit tough (75:02 - 75:11)
but I think the idea is is that you're (75:07 - 75:13)
supposed to go out and explore and I get (75:11 - 75:14)
the two stiller doing that if you (75:13 - 75:16)
because you know you come across (75:14 - 75:18)
everything else you come across on the (75:16 - 75:20)
way to the Pokemon and I would do the (75:18 - 75:22)
same if I could just choose a Pokemon (75:20 - 75:26)
and you know if it happens to be visible (75:22 - 75:28)
on my map it like shows or it would like (75:26 - 75:31)
tell me where where it is I would (75:28 - 75:33)
definitely go after it (75:31 - 75:34)
but I don't I just don't know if that's (75:33 - 75:36)
how Niantic wants to play the game yeah (75:34 - 75:42)
yeah yeah Steve yeah for it catch that (75:36 - 75:44)
vascular and then take each basket and (75:42 - 75:48)
that comes across your path as a gift (75:44 - 75:48)
take that crabby the one that you got (75:50 - 75:55)
and just deal with it (75:53 - 75:58)
that's your crabby Steve I don't know I (75:55 - 76:05)
I see your points do you don't know be (75:58 - 76:09)
nice do that to him I agree with him but (76:05 - 76:11)
it's no no no I I don't think that that (76:09 - 76:15)
should be added because I just feel like (76:11 - 76:18)
the whole so it took me I don't remember (76:15 - 76:19)
the exact number but I want to say (76:18 - 76:21)
somewhere in the realm of a hundred and (76:19 - 76:23)
fifty days from the day gibble was (76:21 - 76:24)
released (76:23 - 76:27)
to catch a gibble in the wild and while (76:24 - 76:29)
it was annoying and I saw I even saw had (76:27 - 76:31)
silhouettes sometimes but it was just (76:29 - 76:33)
you know I was going somewhere I didn't (76:31 - 76:35)
have the time to actually like veer off (76:33 - 76:39)
and go get it but 150 days and it was so (76:35 - 76:41)
exciting to catch that gibble and then (76:39 - 76:45)
like a couple last weekend I was down by (76:41 - 76:47)
the water and another one just spawned (76:45 - 76:50)
and it was so exciting that that (76:47 - 76:52)
happened like I feel like you take some (76:50 - 76:53)
of that excitement away which I think (76:52 - 76:55)
magnetic wants people to have maybe (76:53 - 76:57)
being able to go hunt any Pokemon at any (76:55 - 77:00)
time yeah maybe like where my situation (76:57 - 77:04)
is I like drove for hours to get to Gen (77:00 - 77:06)
Con and I parked my I dropped Irene off (77:04 - 77:08)
at Gen Con and then I had to park like (77:06 - 77:11)
six blocks away in a lot and I walked (77:08 - 77:16)
and million times faster than my wife so (77:11 - 77:17)
that's why I was like here you're here (77:16 - 77:19)
at the destination I will walk way (77:17 - 77:21)
faster than you and get back to the (77:19 - 77:22)
destination so that's fine and when I (77:21 - 77:25)
parked there was a gal bite that spawned (77:22 - 77:29)
it was the opposite direction of Gen Con (77:25 - 77:32)
so Gen Con was like six blocks south the (77:29 - 77:34)
gabite was like three blocks north and (77:32 - 77:36)
it was the final day of Gen Con and the (77:34 - 77:39)
doors were closing a little bit earlier (77:36 - 77:41)
than the other days and I've already (77:39 - 77:43)
committed four hours to drive down there (77:41 - 77:45)
so I can't it couldn't be like well let (77:43 - 77:47)
me take like I'm 20 minutes out of my (77:45 - 77:48)
way to walk this way I get the gabite (77:47 - 77:51)
then walk voices long back to the (77:48 - 77:53)
convention what I just spent four hours (77:51 - 77:57)
to get here and so now that I did hatch (77:53 - 78:01)
a give oh I'm never evolving my give all (77:57 - 78:04)
that will take away the silhouette of (78:01 - 78:07)
the gamma heat because I know gap might (78:04 - 78:09)
spawn the wild and once I see that (78:07 - 78:11)
silhouette I'm gonna do everything in my (78:09 - 78:15)
power to now get to that silhouette and (78:11 - 78:17)
catch it and then the problem is there (78:15 - 78:20)
yeah but the problem is yeah bite so (78:17 - 78:23)
hard to get right now they're delicate (78:20 - 78:26)
yeah right but I don't want to spend the (78:23 - 78:28)
gibble candy to get into the valve it (78:26 - 78:30)
took a bite to get rid of the silhouette (78:28 - 78:32)
when I need more gibble to get the (78:30 - 78:36)
Garchomp I'm saving myself twenty five (78:32 - 78:38)
candy guys for not above (78:36 - 78:41)
my gibble right through the gas bite you (78:38 - 78:43)
stop right now how many rare candies do (78:41 - 78:45)
you have a hundred and seventy-three (78:43 - 78:51)
Greg I checked this morning I used my (78:45 - 78:54)
rare candy Greg to power up my Mewtwo (78:51 - 78:56)
that you traded me that end up being (78:54 - 78:59)
lucky I put my heart and soul into this (78:56 - 79:05)
me too 500 rare candy no I'm not a (78:59 - 79:08)
Galvin a single I have enough to get to (79:05 - 79:09)
scolipede but I'm not evolving to (79:08 - 79:11)
Wartell Pete because I'm sure that of (79:09 - 79:15)
spawns in the wild I need the silver (79:11 - 79:17)
left in my life this life that you are (79:15 - 79:20)
living is a nightmare of your own making (79:17 - 79:23)
here okay the other thing has catch the (79:20 - 79:27)
throw catch the bascule and be at peace (79:23 - 79:27)
I get nothing I get nothing for evolving (79:27 - 79:34)
to scolipede except 25 candy down the (79:31 - 79:36)
drain that's all that's all that happens (79:34 - 79:38)
25 scolipede candy that you aren't gonna (79:36 - 79:41)
use that's not true what if I can't what (79:38 - 79:43)
if I get a good skull Pete this is what (79:41 - 79:45)
always happens I use that good (79:43 - 79:48)
scalloping for what rain right now are (79:45 - 79:50)
you gonna be like look flexing your (79:48 - 79:53)
scolipede some of us have a skull Abid (79:50 - 79:55)
plush because it's actually a really (79:53 - 79:59)
cute pokémon it is but that doesn't help (79:55 - 80:01)
you in a max rate or a regular rate or (79:59 - 80:09)
any rate eventually it's a fairy type (80:01 - 80:11)
Pokemon fairies are weak to poison their (80:09 - 80:13)
banner poisons xerneas will show up in (80:11 - 80:17)
like two years the endings release and (80:13 - 80:22)
things if we're lucky where's my (80:17 - 80:24)
dirtiest shadow I don't see any on the (80:22 - 80:28)
map right now yeah but when that shadow (80:24 - 80:34)
shows up Greg I'll be like this is the (80:28 - 80:36)
one that I meant to catch this is the (80:34 - 80:39)
one that the universe wanted me to have (80:36 - 80:42)
did you never speak before we before (80:39 - 80:44)
twenty eight twenty thirty with a (80:42 - 80:46)
scolipede community day you'll have (80:44 - 80:52)
plenty of communities I I've just asked (80:46 - 80:54)
this real quick we there was I don't (80:52 - 80:55)
know if you know this Bobby but there (80:54 - 80:56)
was something in the code where they (80:55 - 80:59)
were saying like min Chino and chin (80:56 - 81:02)
Chino we're possibly shiny possibly did (80:59 - 81:04)
you hear anything about that or yeah (81:02 - 81:07)
miss yes is that it's supposed to be a (81:04 - 81:08)
community day or is that supposed to be (81:07 - 81:11)
like a fee bass day so I believe it (81:08 - 81:13)
supposed to be like a fee bass day and (81:11 - 81:15)
with Lunar New Year coming up and (81:13 - 81:18)
Niantic doing the Lunar New Year tweets (81:15 - 81:21)
right now like every day so that two (81:18 - 81:23)
days ago they just tweeted out the pic a (81:21 - 81:26)
picture or an emoji of a full moon so (81:23 - 81:28)
Cresselia is coming back after here and (81:26 - 81:30)
that's what you're saying yep sure and (81:28 - 81:33)
then after like yesterday they it was a (81:30 - 81:36)
you know three quarters and then today (81:33 - 81:38)
it was half and so I'm sure they're (81:36 - 81:40)
gonna make an announcement on Tuesday (81:38 - 81:44)
probably about the Lunar New Year event (81:40 - 81:47)
since the Lunar New Year starts January (81:44 - 81:51)
25th so I think people are thinking (81:47 - 81:52)
there are no rats in the game right now (81:51 - 81:54)
it's a year of the rat coming up and (81:52 - 81:56)
there's no rats in the game that haven't (81:54 - 81:59)
been or that aren't shiny right now you (81:56 - 82:01)
know they like first year they did shiny (81:59 - 82:03)
Poochyena second year they did shiny (82:01 - 82:08)
splink you're the pig so yes you're the (82:03 - 82:12)
pig so this is your the metal rat so (82:08 - 82:16)
tomorrow in the game so people are (82:12 - 82:17)
thinking man Chino is gonna be (82:16 - 82:20)
associated during that event a nose on a (82:17 - 82:26)
rat oh yeah but if you look at the what (82:20 - 82:28)
they found the research tasks they're (82:26 - 82:31)
all based on catching Rattata (82:28 - 82:34)
Pikachu wait a minute that's all right (82:31 - 82:41)
either anyways yeah so I it really looks (82:34 - 82:44)
like it's not me love disco Lola bola (82:41 - 82:47)
are related they are in my heart (82:44 - 82:50)
um it looks like it's gonna be a special (82:47 - 82:52)
research day like Phoebus or something (82:50 - 82:54)
cuz there's a bunch of tasks that all (82:52 - 82:58)
end with catching em in Chino so what (82:54 - 83:00)
what it what is our February community (82:58 - 83:02)
today then the patterns are broken (83:00 - 83:04)
they're all done there's no more (83:02 - 83:06)
paranoia we've predicted those for two (83:04 - 83:09)
years straight we got the rods I did a (83:06 - 83:12)
prediction last month I did like uh like (83:09 - 83:14)
an edit I just put some different (83:12 - 83:15)
Pokemon into a picture and posted it on (83:14 - 83:18)
Instagram and in my prediction it was (83:15 - 83:20)
like gibble and then like literally six (83:18 - 83:22)
hours later they just surprise released (83:20 - 83:25)
SHINee gibble so my prediction is (83:22 - 83:27)
already completely thrown off I have no (83:25 - 83:28)
idea what they're gonna do next it's no (83:27 - 83:33)
arms gravel er weights are much higher (83:28 - 83:39)
life for this the other two are you (83:33 - 83:41)
aren't use of those you're just a ball (83:39 - 83:46)
gibeom uh no February I think so last (83:41 - 83:49)
February it was swine up which has (83:46 - 83:52)
related to the year the pig its togepi (83:49 - 83:54)
related cuz of cupid its togepi (83:52 - 83:57)
community today because it turns into (83:54 - 84:00)
togetic which i keep it shiny in the (83:57 - 84:02)
game but i wouldn't mind that at all I (84:00 - 84:06)
don't know I may be shiny Bidoof yeah (84:02 - 84:10)
that's - I mean B - vis tech well blob (84:06 - 84:12)
we all know Bidoof is a beaver it is (84:10 - 84:14)
technically classified as the plump (84:12 - 84:17)
mouse Pokemon right (84:14 - 84:19)
so missile yeah that's actually not (84:17 - 84:21)
awful it only has one another up you (84:19 - 84:24)
know one stage evolution but shinier a (84:21 - 84:27)
decade's they're here they're here with (84:24 - 84:29)
parties they already came and went with (84:27 - 84:33)
party hats I'm not coming back (84:29 - 84:33)
shiny Luna tones it's that did they (84:33 - 84:38)
didn't do star Lee yeah I guess I mean (84:36 - 84:40)
we don't well they haven't done like (84:38 - 84:44)
Bellsprout yet they haven't done (84:40 - 84:44)
there's some jello left that I'm (84:44 - 84:48)
surprised I haven't done yet (84:46 - 84:50)
well you can't well look this is the (84:48 - 84:52)
same company that didn't do ghastly (84:50 - 84:56)
during Halloween that's true but I will (84:52 - 85:00)
say they have somewhat kept a pattern (84:56 - 85:03)
alive right so because it was Pikachu (85:00 - 85:05)
and then it was I was a teeny (85:03 - 85:08)
there's no platters (85:05 - 85:10)
I don't know I don't know I mean the (85:08 - 85:14)
pattern was 10k eggs and then Eevee (85:10 - 85:15)
broke that and people were like well (85:14 - 85:17)
that doesn't count visit that this is (85:15 - 85:20)
everyone's always like then that doesn't (85:17 - 85:22)
count towards our pattern you're ruining (85:20 - 85:24)
our pattern get out of here with the (85:22 - 85:25)
Eevee and then swine up just hit him (85:24 - 85:29)
real hard and didn't have an excuse (85:25 - 85:29)
swine up didn't come from no 10k no but (85:30 - 85:37)
they was you're the pig so yeah see that (85:35 - 85:39)
one there was the excuse while I was (85:37 - 85:42)
here the pig that's why they like his (85:39 - 85:44)
why they did swine up because it was (85:42 - 85:47)
you're the pig yeah I guess my like (85:44 - 85:49)
there's no there's no more ten kegs at (85:47 - 85:52)
this point besides correct things that (85:49 - 85:54)
are extremely rare that they're not (85:52 - 85:56)
gonna give up at this point they're not (85:54 - 85:58)
gonna suddenly make gibble more common (85:56 - 86:03)
ah your ax you none of those are gonna (85:58 - 86:06)
become more common but I will say that (86:03 - 86:09)
in the game oh you better believe it's (86:06 - 86:11)
the year of goldfish Greg is it the (86:09 - 86:13)
Shaniqua fish just start and end the (86:11 - 86:15)
year the quill fish we get one day and (86:13 - 86:19)
that's all it deserves every time with (86:15 - 86:20)
shiny cool I mean they could do hop it (86:19 - 86:23)
if if they want to do a three-stage no (86:20 - 86:26)
that's gonna be April I think they'll do (86:23 - 86:30)
so we want to talk patterns for a second (86:26 - 86:33)
love matter the living patterns Jenny (86:30 - 86:34)
you told me there was gonna be two new (86:33 - 86:36)
V's cuz Jen to Hattie B's Jen for hat (86:34 - 86:39)
V's Jen six head V's gen8 gonna have V's (86:36 - 86:40)
you heard it here first (86:39 - 86:42)
yeah but they messed up the pattern (86:40 - 86:43)
because it was really they were (86:42 - 86:45)
deducting an Eevee every other (86:43 - 86:49)
generation oh I see in Gen 4 and then (86:45 - 86:51)
one in Gen 6 and 0 and Jenny math just (86:49 - 86:55)
falls apart here so anyways uh they (86:51 - 86:58)
didn't do they still did 10 days after (86:55 - 87:01)
swine hub right because it was like (86:58 - 87:04)
Bagon and then it was (87:01 - 87:06)
FLAC off (87:04 - 87:08)
at some point those are all community (87:06 - 87:09)
days I believe (87:08 - 87:12)
yes can't forget Ralts Ralts that yeah (87:09 - 87:15)
sure that broke pattern to that or that (87:12 - 87:16)
that was that was that was for (87:15 - 87:20)
evolutions not three but also they (87:16 - 87:23)
released Jen for last year but never (87:20 - 87:27)
went beyond gen 3 community dates okay (87:23 - 87:29)
so my guess is that they'll they won't (87:27 - 87:31)
go beyond Jen for community days this (87:29 - 87:36)
year okay Jen for has a big issue here (87:31 - 87:37)
because it's so small (87:36 - 87:41)
cuz that pokedex is garbage well but (87:37 - 87:44)
you've got I guess most of the things (87:41 - 87:46)
that evolve that got like that third (87:44 - 87:48)
stage evolution how already comes shiny (87:46 - 87:49)
yeah (87:48 - 87:52)

Valentine's Day colors pink and purple (88:23 - 88:31)
yeah I'm if I got put money down I'm (88:26 - 88:33)
gonna say hop it's gonna be my guess (88:31 - 88:37)
first February yeah I could see horse (88:33 - 88:40)
fuel uh yeah yeah they did it they did (88:37 - 88:43)
an ice type Pokemon in February of 2000 (88:40 - 88:45)
I could you have got about one feel (88:43 - 88:48)
February of 2020 you know I played (88:45 - 88:49)
through all sir shield I don't remember (88:48 - 88:54)
this Pokemon name is feel I've never (88:49 - 88:57)
heard never seen this Pokemon before (88:54 - 88:57)
Whismur I'm just looking through what's (88:58 - 89:03)
what's got to stage (89:00 - 89:05)
they don't have I mean you don't have to (89:03 - 89:07)
do two stages though they could they (89:05 - 89:10)
could do uh what's another actual Mouse (89:07 - 89:12)
Pokemon though I'll actually do like the (89:10 - 89:16)
Bidoof that actually sounds like (89:12 - 89:18)
something they would do yeah I can hear (89:16 - 89:20)
it (89:18 - 89:20)
there was a whole central event wasn't (89:21 - 89:26)
there maybe yeah I'm sure yeah sure was (89:23 - 89:28)
promoted at one point by event I mean it (89:26 - 89:30)
was as China came out in the Sentra were (89:28 - 89:33)
increased I think yeah I think it will (89:30 - 89:36)
be like a man Chino special research day (89:33 - 89:38)
which I feel like could happen within (89:36 - 89:41)
the next couple weeks and then who knows (89:38 - 89:45)
for a February community today PD would (89:41 - 89:46)
be fun let's do that (89:45 - 89:51)
Bidoof yeah let's do Bidoof let's go (89:46 - 89:54)
Niantic reddit continues to say Ralts we (89:51 - 90:01)
say be still oh sure I don't know this (89:54 - 90:03)
time they're all male seeing effect laid (90:01 - 90:07)
us first reddit yeah I don't know I you (90:03 - 90:09)
know honestly though like Minchin ochin (90:07 - 90:11)
Chino would be fine for community I (90:09 - 90:12)
think but if they're gonna do you like (90:11 - 90:14)
some special event that's cool too I (90:12 - 90:15)
suppose (90:14 - 90:17)
yeah well it's just cuz what they found (90:15 - 90:19)
were so many research tasks that were (90:17 - 90:22)
the end of the research task was catch (90:19 - 90:24)
him in Chino or whatever or like though (90:22 - 90:26)
sorry the reward was him in Chino oh and (90:24 - 90:28)
and those research tasks were related (90:26 - 90:30)
around like cash five Rattata or like (90:28 - 90:32)
catch my Pikachu or of all they were (90:30 - 90:35)
they really related with mouse and rat (90:32 - 90:38)
type Pokemon or an eccentric was one of (90:35 - 90:40)
them as well so like rodents squirrel (90:38 - 90:43)
which I don't know type Pokemon so I (90:40 - 90:45)
think that is gonna be some somehow tied (90:43 - 90:48)
into the Lunar New Year event and I'm (90:45 - 90:49)
assuming as they've done with the past (90:48 - 90:52)
special research field research days (90:49 - 90:54)
they've introduced the shiny with that (90:52 - 90:58)
so I could see them doing gin Chino and (90:54 - 90:59)
then having its shiny (90:58 - 91:01)
erm in Chino and having a shiny released (90:59 - 91:05)
wheedle community today if you're lucky (91:01 - 91:07)
trainers (91:05 - 91:09)
ooh you know who they haven't done yet (91:07 - 91:10)
who a lot of people have asked for is (91:09 - 91:13)
Rhyhorn a Rhyhorn community today ah (91:10 - 91:15)
round would be cool (91:13 - 91:18)

rhyperior yeah yeah it's definitely that (91:18 - 91:26)
maybe like the only yeah right ear ear (91:23 - 91:28)
and I think (91:26 - 91:32)
the ketha key are the only Gen 4 Evo's (91:28 - 91:35)
from the previous gens that don't have (91:32 - 91:37)
nosepass or Provo past doesn't have (91:35 - 91:39)
their shiny and game yet I don't think (91:37 - 91:40)
anyone's get another chair for a Provo (91:39 - 91:44)
pass or know that gold that gold knows (91:40 - 91:46)
pass (91:44 - 91:46)
looking pretty good pretty good oh they (91:47 - 91:55)
could do Happiny oh they don't do babies (91:53 - 91:55)
oh come on (91:55 - 91:58)
no I thought it was already oh wait (91:55 - 92:00)
let's transition this chase is not (91:58 - 92:02)
shiny yet no think it's the only baby (92:00 - 92:04)
Pokemon that in chingling aren't shiny (92:02 - 92:06)
yet Oh a real there's a bunch of them (92:04 - 92:07)
are Chinese there's not a bunch of (92:06 - 92:09)
babies aren't shining it they're running (92:07 - 92:11)
out of Chinese not only is an antic (92:09 - 92:13)
running out of the end of the Pokedex (92:11 - 92:15)
they are running out of Chinese well (92:13 - 92:17)
that's what keeps their game going right (92:15 - 92:20)
I'm very invested in this like (92:17 - 92:24)
in game of Pokemon can run out of things (92:20 - 92:28)
em yeah yeah I don't see any other I (92:24 - 92:29)
don't know I'm pretty sure I think (92:28 - 92:31)
they'll stick with the three-tier stuff (92:29 - 92:33)
so far I mean there's some feel like (92:31 - 92:36)
there's a lot of them if they haven't (92:33 - 92:38)
done yet so I don't think they're gonna (92:36 - 92:39)
I don't think they'll go away from that (92:38 - 92:43)
to like a two-tier pokémon species yet (92:39 - 92:44)
the only mean and the only one was (92:43 - 92:45)
Pikachu so far and that's just because (92:44 - 92:47)
it's Pikachu so obviously had to go (92:45 - 92:51)
first just kecleon yeah that'd be nice (92:47 - 92:52)
to get kecleon eventually in-game (92:51 - 92:56)
they're all invisible this is the worst (92:52 - 92:58)
community today they're there you just (92:56 - 93:00)
can't find them randomly hit around the (92:58 - 93:03)
screen until something happens (93:00 - 93:04)
I really thought they'd do kecleon with (93:03 - 93:07)
a ghost snapshot thing eventually like (93:04 - 93:10)
set out some your goal and throw kecleon (93:07 - 93:12)
in there but they already have again (93:10 - 93:15)
it's invisible yes 13 in the game since (93:12 - 93:19)
Melton yep actually it has right (93:15 - 93:20)
when some people accidentally catching (93:19 - 93:24)
kecleon yeah there was like a ring weird (93:20 - 93:28)
area where part of there was a there was (93:24 - 93:30)
a region I feel like where when Melton (93:28 - 93:35)
was known as the like but it was still (93:30 - 93:37)
it was still turning into ditto but left (93:35 - 93:39)
sometimes instead of melt and popping up (93:37 - 93:41)
it was kecleon popping up and then it (93:39 - 93:42)
would turn into a ditto I remember this (93:41 - 93:46)
oh yeah I remember that so much chaos (93:42 - 93:48)
all right here here's the curveball that (93:46 - 93:54)

your favorite side story in a Pokemon (96:08 - 96:14)
game for example Wally's journey in (96:10 - 96:16)
generation three is really prominent (96:14 - 96:18)
wait that's not a side story that's like (96:16 - 96:20)
that main story Vader (96:18 - 96:22)
well I suppose if you consider the (96:20 - 96:25)
villain plot the main story then yeah (96:22 - 96:27)
sure but it's interesting to see a (96:25 - 96:29)
character overcome their sickness and (96:27 - 96:31)
become one of the best wait was while I (96:29 - 96:33)
sleep with maybe it was a side-lying (96:31 - 96:35)
maybe I didn't pay attention he was sick (96:33 - 96:42)
yes life what if he was sick of life I (96:35 - 96:48)
think we're all ill Wally needed fresh (96:42 - 96:50)
air like he had to move because he was (96:48 - 96:52)
having trouble breathing so uncle and (96:50 - 96:56)
dad feel bad about laughing on I don't (96:52 - 96:57)
know that they ever state what he was (96:56 - 97:03)
sick with it was just one of those oh he (96:57 - 97:06)
needs to be by the sea because he's sick (97:03 - 97:09)
and weak and then he isn't I don't know (97:06 - 97:11)
that they ever actually said what the (97:09 - 97:14)
illness was I despite his illness it (97:11 - 97:16)
while he's young sickly but yeah they (97:14 - 97:18)
don't say he's just sick (97:16 - 97:21)
his illness has never explained but it (97:18 - 97:26)
is probably either bronchitis but could (97:21 - 97:28)
be asthma listen II he has appropriate (97:26 - 97:30)
yeah I'm looking yeah as Ellis has never (97:28 - 97:32)
explained but his symptoms appeared to (97:30 - 97:33)
clear up in clean air suggesting that is (97:32 - 97:37)
either acute bronchitis or asthma (97:33 - 97:39)
get-get him inhaler (97:37 - 97:40)
I don't know if this counts as a side (97:39 - 97:43)
story but I like (97:40 - 97:45)
I like how Olli Ana's Pokemon tell a (97:43 - 97:47)
story did what is but is the story tell (97:45 - 97:51)
us the story Oh like she's a strong (97:47 - 97:53)
female character and so she has strong (97:51 - 97:56)
female Pokemon but her last Pokemon is a (97:53 - 97:59)
gar border because she lived in poverty (97:56 - 98:01)
until chairman Rose saved her all right (97:59 - 98:03)
pretty good hey it's not a side story (98:01 - 98:10)
but no no I mean either he's your rival (98:03 - 98:17)
the advisor I said that somebody before (98:10 - 98:18)
the Elite Four (98:17 - 98:19)
you have battlin before the leaf for (98:18 - 98:22)
odorous you do run into him in thing but (98:19 - 98:24)
what's her name who's the character's (98:22 - 98:27)
name in Ruby or shields is the Yampa (98:24 - 98:29)
your shield Ruby or shield my favorite (98:27 - 98:32)
version is the Ruby Ruby and Sapphire (98:29 - 98:36)

world devastation I'm carrying his (99:30 - 99:35)
