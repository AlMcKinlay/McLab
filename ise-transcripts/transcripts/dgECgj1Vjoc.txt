[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400 in second episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host Steve SBJ and with me today is will you have to part in my aggravation and frustration all I wanted to do was take a walk to st. Paul this morning and it decided to do something that's I've never seen before halfway between rain and snow I I don't know but I just could not venture out into that so I have a little like non exercise frustration going on here mmm Greg also here it's called spring this is what spring do in Minnesota it's Lietz was that sleet I don't know it's sure of pace well it's a mixture between snow and rain it's that sort of in-between it's technically sleet except there's there were it winds so it was more like snowy rain I maybe wasn't wind up in your part of town there's certainly lose a lot of wind down at my party yeah it's pretty quiet up here up in the north this has been another episode of the weather podcast this is your minnesota weather forecast okay we got some cool things to talk about today pokemon news that did happen which masters news we have some sorta news we have some pokemon go news actually really interesting pokemon good news this week as it doesn't have to do with events although there is a new event going on so even if you don't play pokemon go I think this news is at least interest not it's not a lot but I think it's it's still interesting I also launched a Animal Crossing podcast recently called animals crossing lines which you can find everywhere you can find podcast it should be in iTunes and Google Play podcasts or Google Play Music and Google podcast and Spotify and stitcher and overcast and and pocket casts and pablor wherever wherever you found podcast it should be there if you cannot find it just let me know I can do a manual submission too the podcast service to make sure it shows up although 99% of podcast services just read an RSS feed so it should not automatically be there but there there's short 10-minute episodes if you guys don't know about Animal Crossing there are 300 and I think there are 400 animals in in New Horizons and so each episode is about 10 minutes long and it covers one animal in episode so you can get to know them a little bit better I have some fun trivia about them so they're short first time I'm doing like a very short mini podcast kind of thing so we'll see if that takes off that might actually be helpful for some people that you used to listen to podcasts on their commute and they might not be commuting anymore so which might be bad for the show this is where a real long podcast are you doing resident and non-resident animals or only resident animals I've only been doing residents just because I think a lot of the time people don't know what animals they could get to move in and so by explaining these possible like I didn't know about but there's an animal called boomer and he's he's a penguin and I used to have boomer and I've been playing Animal Crossing since the gamecube version and I think boomer was introduced in wild world and I haven't I didn't know about boomer just because there's so many animals so now that I do know about boomer I want him to move in I've helped you the best I can that's true I do you have the boomer poster now so I think that's kind of the goal is like if you know Animal Crossing the podcast is it too long where it should be boring you might know it you might learn a trivia thing like you might know who Julian is but don't know Julian's birthday so the podcast gives you the trivia of that or you might go oh I didn't know there was a monkey named Nana and they're hot pink and that's my favorite color and I like monkeys so I want Nana to move in so that's kind of the goal of the podcast it's easy because I can record it myself edit it and then it's only ten minutes or so so I don't have to rely not this is not a complaint but because my schedule is so busy I always have to put people like Greg in a position where we're recording at 1:00 a.m. I will point out where do you think it what about I'm not doing it that's true say for the record at 3:00 a.m. I like fine blending together as it is so I can say to you guys is welcome to my world and the animals crossing lines if you search Animal Crossing it should pop up if you search pkmn caste it also should pop up so pretty easy there all right with that promo out of the way let's get into some news let's let's start with this Pokemon go news this was sent in by namma from our slack community nama I never said that out loud dama Naima I think it's actually Naima Naima I am I I I don't know I've never attempted to say it I'm why I mostly call them by their last name so okay alright well this is from uh Dexter toh Dex just extra go however you say that eSports focused website titled Pokemon go trainers are losing go battle league matches on purpose so go battle league that is some news in itself it's updated to the ultra Cup the only good cup is the great League Cup but I guess we're in ultra season now so so for the article goes some players for some players the allure of GPL go battle League rewards outweighs winning now it would make sense for rewards to be given to players who win and that's exactly how its set up so why would players be losing the reason is to get themselves in a position where it's easier to win this is actually a huge thing in clash Royale I don't know if you remember this Greg I do remember this GPL matches will match you against players of similar rank Beth based on your rank and your rating until you reach to rank 7 and then you will meet meet players of the same rank this changes when you reached rank 8 though at that point you will be given a rank ranking and you can't drop down to a different rank from rank 8 to 10 you will always be matched similars of the trainers with similar rankings it makes sense that less experienced trainers it makes sense that less experienced trainers and therefore easier opponents are found between 1 to 7 because getting to rank 8 isn't that difficult you have to win about 27 matches so once you get to the matchmaking based on rating points winning becomes much harder the only way to give yourself easier matches is minimize your rain rate rating in purpose cases where trainers have built up a higher ranking and then lose several on purpose with go battling not requiring you to walk three kilometres in between sets due to the global health situation losing a lot of battles quickly isn't difficult this is far far from in keeping how much Pokemon games should be played a lot of players are competing for the rewards and apparently the rewards only what else are you competing for her like well you could you could compete just because it's fun there's nothing fun about battling in go I mean would you you can maybe say there's not a lot of fun in rock-paper-scissors Paper Scissors rock there isn't and people don't go out and do as far as I know competitive rock-paper-scissors I thought I'm sure that I am sure there is I am sure there's like a subreddit dedicated to it I'm sure there's there's like caseta not an Alexey knows but this is the fall of humanity I can't remember if clash royale ever fix this but it was the same thing in clash Royale where what people would do is because you got t'roat so you every time you there was three towers and crushed clash royale you could win a match by knocking out one tower but you would only get like one point at the end of the match so what what people would do is when stuff was about to reset for the week they would lose a bunch and then they could just turn their game on and just you know not play and then they'd get the loss and then they'd just lose a bunch and then when they are ready to play their match with people so bad that they could three Tower anyone and then they could get all their weekly rewards instantly and not actually worry about their overall ranking because they were only in it for the rewards and that's like exactly what's happening now and in Pokemon go you know some people might care about their win-loss ratio like oh you know I'm you know 50 wins 75 losses I think that's good etc etc but some people just don't care like I just want the Cabal Ian or just want the rewards if I lose a bunch and then I don't have to spend a dollar to guarantee that I'm gonna get a pokemon my fourth encounter I am more likely to win four matches by losing a bunch getting paired with four bad people beat them easily get my cabal iam not shiny okay rinse and repeat because they don't care about their streak or their win-loss ratio I had no idea they were giving away Pokemon as part of the battle League yes it's the only way right now to get scraggy rough 'let it is one way to get cabal Ian if you don't want to do raids I think Gera Tina isn't it or wasn't it I think it was I think it's been replaced with cabal Ian's right now um but that's how I got my co Balian is go Baddeley guy got lucky and i actually faced one of those players I did I was I'm in rank 6 rank 6 was ranked 7 before they start giving you a number and I faced the player that sent out a magic carpet and a Luvdisc and I was like this is weird and then I was like oh I bet they're purposely losing - did they tap no not at all they didn't do anything they just see yeah that's like they should monitor for people who don't tap at all through the entire battle and then those people like get knocked out or something like that if they're if the point is that they want people to actually battle although I can also understand only doing it for the rewards because there is no World Championships of Pokemon go battle league yet for the glory so there is no glory fYI just sent you an article inside the world of professional rock-paper-scissors own reading pleasure later perfect well they think so do you think well part of this is because there's no limit to how many times you can do go battle yeah so if they were to get to the point where they can read add back the walking which I don't think the walking requirement is that steep honestly I think you're less likely to see people just throwing matches because now those people have to just walk then throw the matches then walk some more and that seems like a lot more work and at that point if you're only in it for cabal iam cheese and people are outside once again it just seems like doing one Co Balian right is probably easier than walking losing five matches walking losing five matches and then getting to a point where you can win two or three matches in a row to get what you're looking for I know I walked seven miles yesterday there was any of people outside when I was up for st. Louis this day I think it will slow it down I don't think it will stop it I mean and why would it is that there are exclusive rewards that are locked behind winning or losing and it we saw this we see this in a lot of different games it's easier to be seen even in VG C's it's easier to drop your ranking down to get a bunch of easy opponents in a row than it is to try to go past sort of the up that that that borderline where people start really knowing what they're doing and even if you have to walk people who just want those rewards are are gonna do it because it's just way easier it just is I don't know that it's like necessarily a bad thing like I would argue that it's ruining the experience but it's not much of an experience we have only real reward the only real thing for doing is getting the reward so if people want to give X amount of people easier wins to get towards that reward so that later they can have easier wins to get to that same reward it's not like the worst thing that's ever happened it's not if both players are trying to throw them has to realize it and take the win it's mostly just against the spirit of the competition right it's like you're supposed to be doing this because you want to be the best not because you want rewards but there's no no glory for being the best so there is that trapping I'm the best at tapping my phone all right some other Pokemon good news here this is this is the good stuff this is the good stuff now I had the good stuff on Friday oh this is actually off the Silk Road subreddit which was pulled from a tweet our Mac 18 verified user on Twitter but I mean they just used a website they are a senior tech reporter from BuzzFeed they just use the website to track this but Pokemon Go app changes their bio so their old bio said step outside and discover Pokemon in the real world follow us for updates get up and go it now says discover Pokemon in the real world follow us or Pokemon go updates [Music] everydays have changed just a Twitter bio I mean yo we can't you can't go out right now I wonder if they were worried about like legal stuff I would say less legal stuff and more what where we are right now in sort of socially being worried about being insensitive yeah and like somebody then turning around and saying well you're encouraging people to go outside and there we go out and they're not suppose you know what my Minnesota governor told me I'm supposed to go outside so I don't know what the issue is people my governor also said you feel free to go to the park just you know keep your space which people aren't doing I was so mad on Friday I'm like get away from me i mmm I could I don't want this to be the discussion of the day but boy oh boy Greg I am so with you on that like get over at your site of that of this path I realize we have to pass to each other but move to the side the psychic-type of n is also going on in Pokemon go yep so yeah I gotta get out rig that wow I never found a giraffe rig I got a ton of solo sis and made my reuni CLIs that last that will last until I think Tuesday evening the lugia hoo event was canceled this cancelled this past weekend as well so Greg will and I were supposed to go to st. Louis together and that was canceled correct and rightly so I decided to stream it from my house to see how good it would be from my house I was well aware that probably getting up and moving even if it was in a car would probably be a better way to play it but I was really curious what the event would be like for somebody who couldn't have that and so I ended up playing 78 hours I missed the first hour and it was okay I mean I ended up with two shinies the event does guarantee you of third shiny or our guaranteed shiny which I guess was the third one I got which was teddiursa yep they did make the event they did a couple cool things number one is it was cool that they were able to give players on those days that they planned for because keep in mind if you bought a ticket in January you probably took those days off and planned some sort of trip around it so most people you know at that point probably still had that weekend available to them and so it was cool that they did something for those people it was also cool that like the event what asks for the event did give you they gave you 200 great balls which is awesome and they were really easy I think one was like yeah evolved five Pokemon or something and then like give your buddy a treat and I don't know catch one grass type or something it was super easy and then when you cash it in you got 100 great balls and then the next set of tasks was like give your buddy 3 3 treats pet your buddy take a picture everybody and then you got another 100 great balls and then when you completed that you got a shiny teddiursa so giving you 200 great balls pretty great I plan for the event so I the day before the event started I went to the park slowly drove through a very empty park and spun all the stops to stock up on pokeballs so I went into the event with 600 pokeballs I ended the event with about a hundred pokeballs and like zero great balls and Sewer ultra balls and I had about started the event with about a hundred great and 100 ultra didn't have to buy anything I didn't have to buy any more pokeballs overall I'd only went to the event with 100 pokeballs you probably ran out like an hour or if you didn't have friends to open gifts from but the the spawns were non-stop I think about every 30 seconds it changed if you didn't catch it yeah if he didn't catch it that was that was the thing that I had to get used to because I had my incense up but and then I was also walking and so when I would see something like oh I'm gonna catch that and then the thing that just popped my incense ooh I can't wait I'll catch that one quick cuz I really wanted to get this one and by the time I'd caught the other one and come back it had switched to a different because it was on like in every it felt more like 20 seconds but it was probably 30 where it would just pop into a different one was so confusing for me too well I would like literately hook on one thing and then it like when it appeared it would be something completely different and then for players who had to take it they gave you one did you have to activate your incense incense or did it automatically now I had to I had I activated mine but then it lasts eight hours it even lasted after the event it just it was just eight hours total yep cuz I had an extra hour even but it was it was confusing because the timer didn't say eight hours one hour and it just kept resetting I was like oh no yeah I wondered yeah that seems like a weird there's probably they probably did it cuz it was easy but right it was confusing at first of like is this supposed to reset on its own the other thing is like the event broke midway through and it turned into nothing but soul OSIS for two hours oh you were supposed to get at like oddish teddiursa lunatone Snivy ferrata my chatot unknown and I was getting at all of those like non-stop for I started at 11:00 until about one o'clock and then I was getting nothing but cirrhosis I I counted I got eleven soul OSIS in a row often in Scent then like a teddy or something like another ten soul OSIS and I was talking to I was streaming on Twitch and I was talking people in chat and they were like yeah we were getting a variety of psychic pokémon but now we're getting nothing but soul OSIS because they cuz people not participating in the event they were seeing like drowsies and goth ITA's and execute and slowpoke but then they also got nothing but celosia sand it was like about two hours then all of a sudden it was like no morsel OSIS and it was like back to lunatone and pikachu and stuff so I'm not sure what bro what broke it's not it's not a complaint to be like I'll I want my money back it was frustrating for sure but also I guess now I have enough for two reuni classes yeah I went to my park up by me which is the art park so there's a lot of stops in a very in a very small circle because it's not a huge park and things responding there on a pretty pretty solid clip I was fairly impressed I walked away with three shiny teddiursa two shiny Luna tones and the reason why I'm announcing my retirement from Pokemon go to shiny Rosalia my family it happened I've won the game no I do not need to continue now you can force lose all your battles yeah to get nothing I don't need anything mommy get when I come Teddy IRS's wait you already got a shiny teddy yourself listen I'm not gonna give you my purple roses no no I said yeah you came out my purple Roselia for I need four to stop reading more yeah see and I need three shiny earth too dear says to breed more let's see how that feels yeah I said you could take the white roses let me in I also didn't try so I think I think it was important for them to acknowledge and do this event because while they did not cancel it and they only postponed it I don't know if I can go to whatever the new date is and like it could be the same weekend you guys are going to Gen Con it could be a weekend where you know I'm in Seattle or I'm in at twitchcon like I don't know when this new date is yeah I mean I will say like I spent two hours has been an hour in the morning at home to see what it was like at home and then I drove to the park and spent an hour there with way too many people and it was fine like I really wish my biggest complaint is the fact that I didn't have like any of the my friends there because obviously prepare hue many reasons that's not possible right now so like it was less fun and I didn't spend as much time on it because it was just me doing it in my house and then me doing in the park with people who don't understand what six-feet means but yeah I mean it was fine it was fine for a fill-in event I feel like given the circumstances they did something that rewarded enough like I got a bunch of Snivy I love Snivy I got a bunch of solo sasai the years like I got a bunch of chatot so people can I got them so people who couldn't do it I can trade I only saw two unknowns I got Elle and I I think hmm yeah I got an eye that's all I got frozen's I was missing tea and I was able to find two teas so but other than that I was like okay I you know for a for a last-minute feeling event it was it was better than I expected but certainly not like super great but yeah I got my two shiny Rosalia and that was probably the highlight of that whole hour of walking around as I go it's fine finally I didn't go anywhere I did it from my office with my pokeball plus but I did end up with a shiny meditite oh the weird Pikachu with a fedora is yeah he's got on his head bowler hat Pikachu I don't know what I'm doing a Pikachu - yeah the most well I'll trade it to you because I don't want it makes me think of Clockwork Orange and I want it off my phone all right yeah when we're allowed to beat each other again okay speaking of meeting new people this is off Pokemon calm Kuzma and go Lysa pod and plumeria and Sol as all crash into Pokemon masters these two sync pairs bring a team skulls toughness to possio in a new all new story event plus some sweet bonuses watch out trainers the toughest team in the low-low region has stomped its way onto the island of pasta passio I don't think they got the memo that team's goal is not the toughest like who's tougher than team skull the AP foundation oh that's not a team give me another team if she remains around age they are the toughest team arrived Pokemon masters the bug type sync pair Guzman and goal isopod and the poison-type sync pair plumeria and Salle's will come to play both five star sync pairs are available in the Guzman and plumeria spotlight scout there is a new story that will feature teams called crash course available up until April 13th in the new signal story a single-player story event you will complete events to earn travel tokens and then you can travel unlock new areas of the map you will also get a new special bonus for having Guzman or plumeria or Liza and lunatone on your team while completing the event that's my favorite member of team skull Eliza and lunatone Oh full disclosure I am partnered with TNA Greg and will I not there are four maps in the team skull crash course that featured the story a story area each one and at the end of the second map you have a chance of battling Kuzma and goal isopod in plumeria ansel Azal even if you haven't scouted them after the story event is over you can traverse a larger map for additional rewards there's also a few extra bonuses there are three missions from the bingo card for this event you can earn 150 gems per day from a login bonus from now until the team skull crash course ends there you go so aren't there items because I've noticed now when I log in I get three alert thing yeah yeah so are there items that are specific to this event that if I don't use them during this event they get converted into other items no I don't think for this one okay because I had that happen I think for the mutilation oak event oh yeah I haven't run into them but I will admit since working from home I found that I don't play mobile games at home when I have better systems so I haven't really delved into this but I if it's it sounds like it's like the Rotom allies event yeah we're in which there weren't specific items to level just that those characters I haven't run into it in this but I will freely admit I also haven't played it I usually in the press announcements they say these events or in the banners if you go into the store they'll have unique things and I haven't seen that let me let me pop it open since I haven't gathered my gems yet today that you don't do that first thing in the morning no I got Crossy to play first thing in the morning there's a three-three banners right now there's the Sabrina Scout Plus present banner there's the fan Tina pres the Bret banner no present and then there's plumeria and Guzman under the same banner and Kuzma and plumeria both have a 1% poll rate whereas fan Tina and Sabrina have a 2% poll rate so they did they did split that for for those characters which I don't know if I love her or not yeah I would rather pull on a 2% Guzman to be honest there isn't in the exchange items the only unique item event that's running right now is the ghost type training event so I would say that there's not item specific for the team skull event can we clear up another piece of confusion I have about this game sure yes okay so I opened the game it blasts horns in my ear and it didn't like I talked to somebody Brock tells me that he got in some good workout routine this morning or something I don't know and then it pops up and it says you get this prize for whatever calendar event and then you get this prize for logging in seven days out of the week and then it pops up the news yep feed right okay so so IX out of the news feed because that's the last thing that pops up and I'm back at the main screen there's a little exclamation point next to my goodie bag because obviously I have to go in to claim the goodie bag my goodness so frustrating but don't know why they do more frustrating than that is there's an exclamation point next to the new speed indicator and I'm like I'm just showed me the news did a news happen in the millisecond space yeah the fact that I have to click on the news again not missing something here it's just it's just how the game is programmed it makes you go into news twice and it it bothers me well just a little red exclamation point alerts are I have to clear them and yes I'm Pavlov's dog if I see red exclamation point I've got to clear it and yeah okay I thought I was missing something about the news feed I should be looking at but okay you know if you're low on gems and you don't care about Kuzma or plumeria at least login every day because you're getting one free character poll every two days just by logging in I mean that's just how I play the game is i log in I look at the news feed and then I lock out I did advance the Barry story one more segment yes because I didn't want to get out of bed and I was like let me find something ridiculous to do on my phone so I just love the two pairs I would like I don't have such a shortage of decent poison types that I really want the salaah so one I could care less about Goliath odd Oh like Pokemon but I don't need it on my team it's water bug I have way better water types and I already have because of the full system a super hyper maxed out Bugsy and surskit that they're already two really good bug Pokemon in here and they're not a lot of great poison ones I mean the fire is there are so many fire types in this game for how little they are actually Pokemon in the actual games I feel like I do want to pull on this banner and I have the gems to do so but man I feel like the second I'm out of gems they're gonna be like here's some gen8 Pokemon and that's what I really want yes that is that is quote how they get you Cranmer ant is what you want I don't yeah well there's not losing weight who's gonna be paired with Krammer and no one the only person that actually uses kramer and the story is hop and they're gonna give hop I mean if I shouldn't say they're going to get like I don't know I'm assuming they would give hop double yeah yeah I would agree so I don't think there'd be any actual in-game story character using crema rant alright well let's take a break when we come back we got some sword and shield news and a little bit of TCG news so we will be right back [Music] forgot to mention this at the beginning of

sorry Pokemon fans your gold plated cards from Burger King aren't worth squat they oh the closet is going up in value this might be the time to sell all right it looks like complete six boxes and all six by now for one $24.99 this one saying all of them complete in box all six 120 this one saying all new 150 although there's no bids on any of these yeah there you go so the actual price is zero because nobody's willing to buy them you know possibly this person saying they're doing all six for 99 this one's only doing them you two for 50 bucks I don't think that's a deal that's not a deal if you can get all of them for 99 it's very true I'm gonna turn around I'll sell it for 150 that's how you play the auction I learned that from mmo's okay well we'll circle back in a couple years we'll let them uh well though let them get a little more value to them all right here's our sword and shield news Giganta max Charizard garbo derp kappa raja Doral Adan Durell udon sorry that's how we say it we heard them actually say it finally oh we did we did in the Nintendo Mini direct oh well appear we said it was Jerry Liu done what were you saying before I think I was saying wait derp derp Alan is add raladin order Lou done now I don't know cuz it's neuro for durable yes yeah I think it's Doral lewd on Doral addi you are a dura lu-don yeah I agree Derrell udon oh are you bringing up that clip I don't actually have the clip favorited but I have the point in the trailer where they said Doral Adan is that what we said no okay that's how they say it Doral Doral Dom to raladin Doral Adan there we go it's in podcast writing what what what was I reading oh Giganta max Charizard garbodor kappa roger in Doral Adan appear in max where they don't know how pronunciation it's possible okay so this is this is the more important news before we get to the right radio rotation we've been saying in telly on wrong what they say they finally say out loud cinder a s-- pretty easy rhythms in Taraki yeah it's in doraji so moving on Rilla boom very easy and then we've all been saying in the podcast for months in telly on time to make some people upset it's in telly in not in telling a lien yes like chameleon oh no that makes sense yeah it doesn't it make sense I don't want to see it yeah that's not gonna be Intel Eon in cinder Archie so so it's in telly in any time they like break down a like a name like my like Milotic and like write quite career quaza like well like make sense it frustrates me because they don't keep it consistent they do though I mean like with the exception of Arceus is also based off of oh like you're saying like oh they're Pokemon in the yeah because people always default to the Arceus one but like they've went on record saying they've changed our siestas name they've never been on record being like uh you know people didn't say my elliptic right so we changed it to my load like like it's always been my letting I just wish they would have consistency because all they literally need is for the Pokedex to say these pokemons names that's all they have to do yeah languages no one could possibly debate it because like every time I hear the argument it's like I saw somebody make the argument Nintendo doesn't know actual Pokemon pronunciation like what you can't trust the Nintendo Direct well if you can't trust the Nintendo Direct who are we trusting at this point because these are the same people they're like all you can't trust the anime well if you can't trust the anime and you can't trust the pokedex 3d app and you can't trust the detective PK like I don't who who are we supposed to trust mr. M I'm very upset that like it's called now intelligent like oh my gosh it's like Adam anyways that's my daily rant for the show but what were we talking about yeah no you're right Greg like Charmeleon kecleon in telly and they all have different they all end with a yawn this one is more frustrating cuz it's supposed to also be based off of a chameleon so if you're gonna say like kecleon who is 100% of chameleons should then be changed yeah but kecleon sounds so weird are we saying kecleon wrong is it kecleon no call up the 3ds oh it's charged let me take a look okay let's charge it's ready to go for this podcast all right well let's do Charmeleon - I'll start with Jeremy Lin because it's easier do that sweet music termi lien yeah in tele in I guess those are similar [Music] [Laughter] Nintendo get it together quit now front they they don't know they don't know how the Pokemon I am sorry pretty yeah they've they've never they've never there they haven't had enough time with the Pokemon franchise no there's 890 and the person that figures out pronunciation stopped carrying it around 151 oh boy I get ready for Giganta max take over and pokemon sword and shield as gigantic versions of Charizard garbo derp kappa raja how did we say this Doral Adan Doral awashed will be a more a frequent more frequently appearing in max trade battles until April 27th heading to the wild area to search for these elusive Giganta max Pokemon two challenges pokemon in a max raid battle you need to connect your Nintendo switch system to the internet when you see a pillar of light shining in a den you can walk up to it and interact to emit racks red rattle I've a gigantic max Pokemon are appearing more frequently in max berry battles you will encounter one you will sometimes encounter one of them instead of a Dynomax Pokemon outside of these special time periods encountering Giganta Max Pokemon eggs extremely rare unless you know how to move your clock forward don't wait you don't want to miss out on your chance okay so the weird thing here in this press release where I've read that off Pokemon comm is in the Nintendo Mini direct they actually say out loud that kappa Raja and Doral Adhan will be appearing more frequently in sword and Charizard and gar motor will be more frequently appearing in shield which Sara B and Bubba pedia have the odds for that pretty much all for Pokemon appear in 3 to 4 star raids I also made a graphic about this but specifically 5 star raids are limited car motor Charizard to shield and then the other two to sword so it is possible to get all four in both gameplay in one game it's just if you specifically wanted five star the five stars were more limited so you'd be easier as a shield player to find garb order or Charizard but still possible to find the other two but that's the same thing they did for ma champion Gengar yes it was also the same thing they did for the elk Remy where certain flavors of Aughrim II were more easy to find in specific stars I think I think Mint was only in three and five stars and Rubik's swirl was only in five and vanilla was only in two or something like that they the Nintendo mini direct also showed off the moves the Giganta max moves that intellagen rila boom and cinder ace do and I believe they all do the same moves that well all their moves are different in the sense of like they look different but I think that all - they all have the same effect which i think is it disables the other pokemons ability oh that's cool yes one when used the opponents abilities have no effect when attacking that's how they worded it exactly there were some other things that they announced at the end of the incentive direct if you did not watch it if you actually go to our youtube channel youtube.com such P came and cast you can watch me watch the Nintendo Direct if you want my opinions on everything I was very excited about the Ring fit update I need a ring fit in there are none for sale remember here look at the two boys that made fun of me for ring fit now we're yell at I'm at the bike shop because I'm gonna buy a bike because I still prefer at the outside than jumping up and down in my living room I mean I'm only interested in ring fit because I am forced to be locked in my home yeah now ring foots going for like 700 bucks on eBay that's the real thing that in who knows that they use hard time well you think you can trade six Burger King gold coins for one ring fit how many how many gold coins for a ring fit so there are newly card designs and there's an early purchase bonus for sword and chill another early purchase bonus maybe they they're they don't have enough pre-orders I'm not sure Pokemon trainers in the gala region can make new league cards to introduce themselves as trainers progress to the adventure on the island of arm over the crown tundra backgrounds effects and frames that were not available in sword and shield will be added players can also change the league card using the row Tommy card maker feature with new outfits designs and hairstyles to create a unique league card trainers who purchase either the sword or shield or the sari players who either purchased the pokemon sword expansion pass or the pokemon shield expansion patch soon after the launch of the I'll okay wait players who purchase eat 'la I gotta get the details right here either expansion pass soon after the launch of the island of armor expansion or for players who were already purchased it while we receive Leon's cap and tights as an early purchase in-game bonus I don't want his tight players will also do players will also be able to receive these islands after the release of the island of armor by the end of June 2020 until 7 a.m. PDT on Monday August 31st 2020 so you get a the pre-order bonus right now is the Pikachu and Eevee shirt or outfit I should say but also you will get Leon's so this is rewarding players to get the expansion before the end of August to get Leon's stuff and sign up for your sign up for the international thing you want the great ball shirt yes sign up for your great ball shirt and then will remind you guys to participate in one battle to actually get the shirt the PO say that knowing I have not signed up the Pokemon sword expansion past and the Pokemon shield expansion past new downloadable content for sword and shield will contain both the island of armor and the crown Tundra two separate adventures where you will be able to meet new characters catch new Pokemon Explorer it does catch new discovered Pokemon so I don't know how many new Pokemon and explore new areas of the gala region the island of armor is still scheduled to be released at the end of June 2020 and the catch crown Tundra fall of 2020 so if I move my calendar to June I'm gonna say June 26 that is the last possible Friday in June that was that would be my guess sounds about right yep well if III was suppose to be what June 8th 9th and 10th and the e3 got canceled they were to probably I mean I guess it could be the 12th 19th or 26 but I'm assuming at e3 there would have probably been a trailer for this to high people up saying it's coming in a week or two I'm sure that Nintendo Direct will still exist that week because Nintendo I mean they can do the treehouse of terror from anywhere yeah correct yeah they can they can treehouse when wherever they want they could be tree housing right now and pre recording it getting it ready does this talk about ursu I don't think this press release does oddly enough I mean it did say you can catch a new pope yeah that's true um so I guess I don't know if you guys saw the Nintendo Direct I did I did not okay so when they do show the island of armor they show the the guy who trained Leon I don't remember his name but the game says like when you train at the dojo which is probably the the story part of it you will receive the legendary Pokemon cub foo mustard that's the name and then there are two different towers on the island one is called the Tower of fists the Tower of two fists oh sorry both towers are called the towers of two fist one is a water tower and one is a darkness tower and so depending on which tower you go into is how come foo will evolve into a Shifu depending on the style so I believe once you go into a tower the other tower will lock you out and greninja will be at the top of both is that what we're picking up here dark powder oh I didn't think of that yeah probably no one is dark in one his water may be grinning just the final one in box yeah it covers both the other thing is near the end of the trailer they show the new slowpoke and they show them running super fast out of the building which is weird cuz slowpoke is really slow also yes so I'm not sure I'm not sure what that signifies I'm much because the slowpoke in the train station that you catch definitely acts like a slowpoke maybe they were scared Journal in rush yeah book in it I guess well you got time for Giganta max Charizard gar border kappa raja derp derp a Ladon dural udon i don't know how does i can't i can't remember how they I got a well I'll get it eventually three days Doral Adan if you need people to raid with I'm still playing Pokemon I'm playing a lot of animal crossing night I'm yeah Monday night right night so will your writing Monday evening for some Charizard xand gar boaters and stuff so if you want to swing by the stream and raid with some other people otherwise this is exactly what's gonna happen in about three weeks when this is ending people are gonna be like I didn't get any of these and no one wants to rate anymore I try to keep to Monday night raid night can I also say I'm a little frustrated that the silhouette of giganta's Ord looks like not kiram or did wait the Dragons from ten five why can't I think of the name right now restaurant now it looks like Reshiram yeah yeah it's real administrating I guess I got a little excited I was like Russia Rams in the game and like oh no it's just gigazord yep Monday night 7:00 central I'm usually on I open up all my raids just to the public if you see it join me cuz I'll tell ya everybody says oh no do away with me I always have one spot where nobody's joined yup same here also just a heads up we've talked about this before cuz but I know they're they're probably new people listing the show and whatnot the code doesn't just work so unlike trading and battling where you're like here's my four digit code let's trade here's my four digit code let's battle it doesn't work for raids so what happens is the why comp specifically looks for people doing raids and it will intermix random people and your friends and so if you aren't friends with somebody you are hoping that then that random person is the person hosting the raid and then you enter a code which is almost never going to happen unless you have really good like server rng just sigh it's saying like hey i have a raid open here's my four digit code that doesn't work ideal you have to add people and then those people will appear on your why comm and then if will goes I have a four star copper Rajah the code is 1 1 1 1 then once you see will on your why comm because you are on his friends list then you can enter the 1 1 1 1 to join so just keep that in mind I know there are some people that are like I'm not no ones hosting raids or I can't see anyone right anyone's raids you you have to add other people so ideally if you're in slack or discord or if you're hanging out on Twitch feel free to post your friend code and have people add you also if you're adding some people add a couple more people because it's way easier to do with 4 humans than it is to humans soul rock and a Magikarp hey hey you got that right mmm so it just goes by quicker just basic human level common courtesy you don't get super salty when no one joins your garbage raids I'm not talking about garv owner I'm talking about your your your lunatone raids or your lantern raids don't be salty when people aren't joining if you're not joining their garbage raids as well although I will get salty when I start up any raid and my three humans bring two shiny mah champs and as Ossian like come on bring the think of type effectiveness here folks now people just flexing those shinies I don't mind doing garbage raids most of the time the garbage raids go way quicker than like a gigantic mechs Pokemon yeah and then you get an ability something or other yeah and or you just stock it up on TMS I feel like people seem to forget like you're still getting you're still getting reward I don't care about the Pokemon at this point but if I'm gonna cycle through my rates faster I'll do a two-star the do just to you know get rid of my five stars saying the Conda not G max that I don't want to do all right ah let's squeeze Pokemon a week in here you don't have a question this week oh sorry question the week that's what I meant to say Greg that's all you oh yes okay sorry I was looking at you I meant I can't - max tough all right ready what is the what is the what's the question of the week Wow short and sweet there you go okay this one is from Chris in our slack community attic channel which modern replacements for HMS do you prefer a Lola's pokey rides pokum let's go secret techniques in in let's go peachy let's go easy or gallows road tom box and Rotom bike and flying taxi I preferred a Lola's poker IDEs cuz I liked feeling mark like it was more Pokemon based in the Pokemon world I just like that more Pokemon connection felt feel that I got from those I prefer the gala person because I absolutely hate having to watch the animation when I want to go someplace in a Lola oh the Charizard thing yeah and it's just like oh please and once again it's like you know and it's the same thing of like my whole original argument for well I actually preferred HM so that could apply them to my Pokemon and then it was my Pokemon that was doing the thing for me and not just a Pokemon that I was told to use kind of moves over to Galler I mean yes the the flying taxis with their weird rules of where they will and he'll not go that way okay but it's like it's my bike that I'm writing so now you know I I can kind of like appreciate that you know that it's my bike that's taking me out onto the water and everything so I prefer that keeps me in the moment a little better than having to like call on the Charizard that I you know would rather be flying on something else but that's fine I prefer the galleries of to the like some of a Lola stuff is just it's it's like a good it was a super good replacement to HMS but pulling out muds Dale to walk across four feet of rocky terrain to get to the other side was so tedious and that was just like away from them to like prevent you from progressing without being like you need muds Dale but even before that well I guess I guess you could go south of the mountain and see the rocky terrain and be like I can't cross this yet I have to beat Sophocles first but they could have just put like path closed where they did with every other part of a low lower it's like up we got paths closed got the tauros on the loose but I do I see you man I I did really think so for let's go Pikachu let's go Evie was so charming to see which Pokemon you could ride like riding Snorlax was so cool being on Persian or arcanine was really cool and I don't know a lot of people like miss the bike but I think riding on arcanine is way cooler than riding a bike but yeah but you could ride the Pokemon but they weren't the HMS yeah a secret technique techniques worst just cut screens for the most part right yeah looking like there was still cut in let's go Pikachu cuz they wanted to keep it somewhat faithful so that was a little bit annoying to be like well I so I gotta cut this bush to get to the other side but I prefer Galler stuff I mean just like I think the I think I like the bike more when I'll be able to customise the bike more in the DLC and then it will feel like my own bike and yeah I think the flying taxing is is fine edged I hate I hate I hate the bike outfits I hate the but I think I think there until I can get something that I like that looks better nah yeah and I don't like I think some of the complaints of a lola's hms are level design and not the actual system of using the pokemon like the fact that they decided to put in rocky ground and that only one type like cry wise choice is the same thing like you can't get across water on the bike until they somehow teach you how to put on inflatable wheels like it's the same bizarre gatekeeping you can't help do this until we teach you how to do this that exists in both is just it's the same well if you have a if so if you have a linear story you don't need to do that because you're forcing the character good to go down paths and they're not gonna see that stuff until they get there but if you have a more open game then you have to have this weird gatekeeping of like okay you can see that over there but you don't have the item to do that or you can go this way but only so far which was like the thing in in lets or the thing in sorting shield where it's like oh I can't go here yet because I need the bike and don't have that I think the game that did that the probably the best was what gen 2 where you could technically go to the like a rage before you did anything else or if you wanted to go the other way you could do that too I mean the T branch the the T branch is mostly a false choice because you could go that way and visit those things but the story events won't activate until you do them in the proper order yes you're gonna have to go back anyway so you have to go back anyways I mean there's there's that that's like the illusion of choice sure you can do it nothing activates and because they made the choice of giving in the illusion of choice those two routes had to be of the same level which made grinding in that game even worse like that's just that straight-up poor design no I agree it's it's like hey we give you choice you can go either way but not really because if you go this one way nothing's gonna happen yeah it's the same like old video game thing of like do you want to join my team yes or no and then no doesn't do anything and it's like at least some games gave you like a witty dialogue if you did like no two or three times in a row yeah but if you're not even going to go out of your way to give me something witty for pressing the other option that you gave me for the illusion of choice then why are you wasting might like why why why is this even just why is this a choice just let me do it like unless you're gonna reward me with an Easter egg which you're not it's just more annoying than anything man I hate that in games I hate the like yes or no into my hat into my camp move here now you have two choices pokemon of the week we'll all right last week's Pokemon I didn't say it explicitly but it was pokemon number 400 it's a beaver and commonly used for a gems as we were just talking about in the past up through through Gen 5 that you could use this one for for a gems so who'd that Pokemon it's Pasquale what that's a villager his name is his name is Pasquale and he's also a nodder not a beef is there a beaver villager yeah I feel like I googled it there is there's Chip and CJ they do the fishing tournament oh that's right cuz they eat the fish after you catch them what they do know they you still hate me I mean Huestis like it's kind of like the chameleon guy who does the insect tournament and he's like oh yeah I'm gonna take care of your bug and then he's like goop when you walk out of the tent I want CJ for my village so bad I think you just hosts the fishing tournament though I don't care I'm too non-resident sorry I want him to live my leaving these people in suspense Greg Pokemon is Fumero I believe Aaron believe they say be barrel I don't care no all pronunciations are off Cara blast let's let's get the details on this bad boy wait how do you spell it bi bi Ribeiro oh come on ya barrel again they don't understand how any of our fee gnomes work that what I'm thinking of sure regalo anyways and I is an Ian Japanese isn't it okay yeah but it's not Japanese here's your trivia origin the barrel seems to be based on uh beaver there you go see there is why it's is why I'm sure it's B barrel because of the yeah yeah bit barrel maybe a combination of beaver or Bieber German or beaver and barrel it also may refer to bib which is similar to the pattern on B barrels front there's not a lot of trivia here the Pokemon shuffle icon what you expect I'll say the conquest icon of B Barrow looking very epic oh yeah that's a good one the we the conquest good Pokemon game the good it's a I should play that again I shall find it the only bad part about that game is the ending so sloggy yeah and it's on the 3ds only yeah also slug no I think was a DES game wasn't it it was a DF game EDS it was like at literally end of the s likes lifecycle I think better to come out 2012 yeah though really close to the end alright this week's Pokemon when sound type is introduced into the game oh sweet Pokemon will be a clear contender it is noted for producing seven either tones or cries which can result in ultrasonic waves that have the power to knock flows flying it has a suction cup on its head to hang from the eaves of buildings or tree branches but it is also known for flying about in warmer weather it cannot learn fly as a move though its sole ability is levitate the first game says Pokemon appeared in where Ruby and Sapphire and fiddling fittingly enough the last games where this Pokemon was available in gay were Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire knowing this Pokemon and its pre evolution you would think they shared typing with Jirachi the wish Pokemon but they do not they are a mono type and not the type you would expect from their appearance this week's Pokemon can be found in stage 100 of Pokemon shuffle within the SIL Burnham use iam segment it is notably the only Pokemon of its type found within this segment of the game in the last games where this Pokemon can be found in the wild there was a 5% chance that it could be found with a cleanse tag this is a held item with no in-battle effect instead if the cleanse tag is held by the your lead Pokemon it reduces your chances of encountering a wild Pokemon there you go that's your Pokemon for the week
