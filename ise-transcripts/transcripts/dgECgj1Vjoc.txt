[Music] (0:01 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 400 in (0:26 - 0:33)
second episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:29 - 0:37)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:33 - 0:43)
SBJ and with me today is will you have (0:37 - 0:44)
to part in my aggravation and (0:43 - 0:46)
frustration all I wanted to do was take (0:44 - 0:49)
a walk to st. Paul this morning and it (0:46 - 0:51)
decided to do something that's I've (0:49 - 0:54)
never seen before halfway between rain (0:51 - 0:58)
and snow I I don't know but I just could (0:54 - 1:02)
not venture out into that so I have a (0:58 - 1:05)
little like non exercise frustration (1:02 - 1:07)
going on here mmm (1:05 - 1:09)
Greg also here it's called spring this (1:07 - 1:12)
is what spring do in Minnesota (1:09 - 1:16)
it's Lietz was that sleet I don't know (1:12 - 1:18)
it's sure of pace well it's a mixture (1:16 - 1:20)
between snow and rain it's that sort of (1:18 - 1:25)
in-between it's technically sleet except (1:20 - 1:26)
there's there were it winds so it was (1:25 - 1:30)
more like snowy rain I maybe wasn't wind (1:26 - 1:31)
up in your part of town there's (1:30 - 1:32)
certainly lose a lot of wind down at my (1:31 - 1:35)
party yeah it's pretty quiet up here up (1:32 - 1:36)
in the north this has been another (1:35 - 1:42)
episode of the weather podcast this is (1:36 - 1:44)
your minnesota weather forecast okay we (1:42 - 1:46)
got some cool things to talk about today (1:44 - 1:49)
pokemon news that did happen which (1:46 - 1:52)
masters news we have some sorta news we (1:49 - 1:54)
have some pokemon go news actually (1:52 - 1:56)
really interesting pokemon good news (1:54 - 1:57)
this week as it doesn't have to do with (1:56 - 1:59)
events although there is a new event (1:57 - 2:02)
going on so even if you don't play (1:59 - 2:04)
pokemon go I think this news is at least (2:02 - 2:07)
interest not it's not a lot but I think (2:04 - 2:11)
it's it's still interesting I also (2:07 - 2:14)
launched a Animal Crossing podcast (2:11 - 2:15)
recently called (2:14 - 2:18)
animals crossing lines which you can (2:15 - 2:20)
find everywhere you can find podcast it (2:18 - 2:24)
should be in iTunes and Google Play (2:20 - 2:26)
podcasts or Google Play Music and Google (2:24 - 2:29)
podcast and Spotify and stitcher and (2:26 - 2:33)
overcast and and pocket casts and pablor (2:29 - 2:35)
wherever wherever you found podcast it (2:33 - 2:36)
should be there if you cannot find it (2:35 - 2:38)
just let me know I can do a manual (2:36 - 2:39)
submission too (2:38 - 2:41)
the podcast service to make sure it (2:39 - 2:44)
shows up although 99% of podcast (2:41 - 2:47)
services just read an RSS feed so it (2:44 - 2:49)
should not automatically be there but (2:47 - 2:53)
there there's short 10-minute episodes (2:49 - 2:56)
if you guys don't know about Animal (2:53 - 2:58)
Crossing there are 300 and I think there (2:56 - 3:01)
are 400 animals in in New Horizons and (2:58 - 3:03)
so each episode is about 10 minutes long (3:01 - 3:06)
and it covers one animal in episode so (3:03 - 3:08)
you can get to know them a little bit (3:06 - 3:10)
better I have some fun trivia about them (3:08 - 3:12)
so they're short first time I'm doing (3:10 - 3:15)
like a very short mini podcast kind of (3:12 - 3:16)
thing so we'll see if that takes off (3:15 - 3:18)
that might actually be helpful for some (3:16 - 3:20)
people that you used to listen to (3:18 - 3:22)
podcasts on their commute and they might (3:20 - 3:25)
not be commuting anymore so which might (3:22 - 3:26)
be bad for the show (3:25 - 3:29)
this is where a real long podcast are (3:26 - 3:33)
you doing resident and non-resident (3:29 - 3:36)
animals or only resident animals I've (3:33 - 3:38)
only been doing residents just because I (3:36 - 3:42)
think a lot of the time people don't (3:38 - 3:44)
know what animals they could get to move (3:42 - 3:46)
in (3:44 - 3:49)
and so by explaining these possible like (3:46 - 3:51)
I didn't know about but there's an (3:49 - 3:53)
animal called boomer and he's he's a (3:51 - 3:57)
penguin and I used to have boomer and (3:53 - 3:59)
I've been playing Animal Crossing since (3:57 - 4:01)
the gamecube version and I think boomer (3:59 - 4:03)
was introduced in wild world and I (4:01 - 4:05)
haven't I didn't know about boomer just (4:03 - 4:06)
because there's so many animals so now (4:05 - 4:08)
that I do know about boomer I want him (4:06 - 4:11)
to move in I've helped you the best I (4:08 - 4:12)
can (4:11 - 4:14)
that's true I do you have the boomer (4:12 - 4:17)
poster now so I think that's kind of the (4:14 - 4:19)
goal is like if you know Animal Crossing (4:17 - 4:22)
the podcast is it too long where it (4:19 - 4:23)
should be boring you might know it you (4:22 - 4:25)
might learn a trivia thing like you (4:23 - 4:27)
might know who Julian is but don't know (4:25 - 4:29)
Julian's birthday so the podcast gives (4:27 - 4:32)
you the trivia of that or you might go (4:29 - 4:35)
oh I didn't know there was a monkey (4:32 - 4:38)
named Nana and they're hot pink and (4:35 - 4:39)
that's my favorite color and I like (4:38 - 4:41)
monkeys so I want Nana to move in so (4:39 - 4:42)
that's kind of the goal of the podcast (4:41 - 4:45)
it's easy because I can record it myself (4:42 - 4:47)
edit it and then it's only ten minutes (4:45 - 4:50)
or so so I don't have to rely not this (4:47 - 4:52)
is not a complaint but because (4:50 - 4:55)
my schedule is so busy I always have to (4:52 - 4:57)
put people like Greg in a position where (4:55 - 5:01)
we're recording at 1:00 a.m. I will (4:57 - 5:03)
point out where do you think it what (5:01 - 5:09)
about I'm not doing it that's true say (5:03 - 5:13)
for the record at 3:00 a.m. I like fine (5:09 - 5:13)
blending together as it is (5:14 - 5:20)
so I can say to you guys is welcome to (5:17 - 5:22)
my world (5:20 - 5:25)
and the animals crossing lines if you (5:22 - 5:26)
search Animal Crossing it should pop up (5:25 - 5:29)
if you search pkmn caste it also should (5:26 - 5:32)
pop up so pretty easy there all right (5:29 - 5:34)
with that promo out of the way let's get (5:32 - 5:38)
into some news let's let's start with (5:34 - 5:42)
this Pokemon go news this was sent in by (5:38 - 5:46)
namma from our slack community nama I (5:42 - 5:47)
never said that out loud (5:46 - 5:50)
dama Naima I think it's actually Naima (5:47 - 5:51)
Naima (5:50 - 5:55)
I am I I I don't know I've never (5:51 - 5:59)
attempted to say it I'm why I mostly (5:55 - 6:03)
call them by their last name so okay (5:59 - 6:07)
alright well this is from uh Dexter toh (6:03 - 6:09)
Dex just extra go however you say that (6:07 - 6:13)
eSports focused website titled Pokemon (6:09 - 6:15)
go trainers are losing go battle league (6:13 - 6:19)
matches on purpose so go battle league (6:15 - 6:21)
that is some news in itself it's updated (6:19 - 6:24)
to the ultra Cup the only good cup is (6:21 - 6:25)
the great League Cup but I guess we're (6:24 - 6:29)
in ultra season now so so for the (6:25 - 6:31)
article goes some players for some (6:29 - 6:34)
players the allure of GPL go battle (6:31 - 6:36)
League rewards outweighs winning now it (6:34 - 6:39)
would make sense for rewards to be given (6:36 - 6:41)
to players who win and that's exactly (6:39 - 6:43)
how its set up so why would players be (6:41 - 6:47)
losing the reason is to get themselves (6:43 - 6:49)
in a position where it's easier to win (6:47 - 6:50)
this is actually a huge thing in clash (6:49 - 6:52)
Royale I don't know if you remember this (6:50 - 6:55)
Greg I do remember this GPL matches will (6:52 - 6:56)
match you against players of similar (6:55 - 6:58)
rank Beth based on your rank and your (6:56 - 7:01)
rating until you reach to rank 7 and (6:58 - 7:04)
then you will meet meet players of the (7:01 - 7:06)
same rank this changes when you reached (7:04 - 7:08)
rank 8 though at that point you will be (7:06 - 7:10)
given a rank ranking and you can't drop (7:08 - 7:13)
down to a different rank from rank 8 to (7:10 - 7:15)
10 you will always be matched similars (7:13 - 7:17)
of the trainers with similar rankings it (7:15 - 7:19)
makes sense that less experienced (7:17 - 7:21)
trainers it makes sense that less (7:19 - 7:22)
experienced trainers and therefore (7:21 - 7:24)
easier opponents are found between 1 to (7:22 - 7:27)
7 because getting to rank 8 isn't that (7:24 - 7:29)
difficult you have to win about 27 (7:27 - 7:31)
matches so once you get to the (7:29 - 7:34)
matchmaking based on rating points (7:31 - 7:37)
winning becomes much harder the only way (7:34 - 7:38)
to give yourself easier matches is (7:37 - 7:40)
minimize your rain rate rating in (7:38 - 7:42)
purpose cases where trainers have built (7:40 - 7:43)
up a higher ranking and then lose (7:42 - 7:46)
several on purpose with go battling not (7:43 - 7:48)
requiring you to walk three kilometres (7:46 - 7:52)
in between sets due to the global health (7:48 - 7:54)
situation losing a lot of battles (7:52 - 7:58)
quickly isn't difficult this is far far (7:54 - 8:00)
from in keeping how much Pokemon games (7:58 - 8:02)
should be played a lot of players are (8:00 - 8:04)
competing for the rewards and apparently (8:02 - 8:06)
the rewards only what else are you (8:04 - 8:09)
competing for her like well you could (8:06 - 8:11)
you could compete just because it's fun (8:09 - 8:15)
there's nothing fun about battling in go (8:11 - 8:22)
I mean would you you can maybe say (8:15 - 8:23)
there's not a lot of fun in (8:22 - 8:25)
rock-paper-scissors Paper Scissors rock (8:23 - 8:29)
there isn't and people don't go out and (8:25 - 8:31)
do as far as I know competitive (8:29 - 8:33)
rock-paper-scissors I thought I'm sure (8:31 - 8:36)
that I am sure there is I am sure (8:33 - 8:38)
there's like a subreddit dedicated to it (8:36 - 8:41)
I'm sure there's there's like caseta not (8:38 - 8:45)
an Alexey knows but this is the fall of (8:41 - 8:48)
humanity I can't remember if clash (8:45 - 8:49)
royale ever fix this but it was the same (8:48 - 8:53)
thing in clash Royale where what people (8:49 - 8:57)
would do is because you got t'roat so (8:53 - 8:58)
you every time you there was three (8:57 - 9:00)
towers and crushed clash royale you (8:58 - 9:02)
could win a match by knocking out one (9:00 - 9:05)
tower but you would only get like one (9:02 - 9:07)
point at the end of the match so what (9:05 - 9:09)
what people would do is when stuff was (9:07 - 9:10)
about to reset for the week they would (9:09 - 9:14)
lose a bunch and then they could just (9:10 - 9:16)
turn their game on and just you know not (9:14 - 9:18)
play and then they'd get the loss and (9:16 - 9:20)
then they'd just lose a bunch and then (9:18 - 9:22)
when they are ready to play their match (9:20 - 9:25)
with people so bad that they could three (9:22 - 9:28)
Tower anyone and then they could get all (9:25 - 9:30)
their weekly rewards instantly and not (9:28 - 9:31)
actually worry about their overall (9:30 - 9:34)
ranking because they were only in it for (9:31 - 9:36)
the rewards and that's like exactly (9:34 - 9:38)
what's happening now and in Pokemon go (9:36 - 9:40)
you know some people might care about (9:38 - 9:42)
their win-loss ratio like oh you know (9:40 - 9:45)
I'm you know 50 wins 75 losses I think (9:42 - 9:45)
that's (9:45 - 9:48)
good etc etc but some people just don't (9:45 - 9:48)
care (9:48 - 9:51)
like I just want the Cabal Ian or just (9:48 - 9:53)
want the rewards if I lose a bunch and (9:51 - 9:55)
then I don't have to spend a dollar to (9:53 - 9:57)
guarantee that I'm gonna get a pokemon (9:55 - 9:59)
my fourth encounter I am more likely to (9:57 - 10:03)
win four matches by losing a bunch (9:59 - 10:06)
getting paired with four bad people beat (10:03 - 10:09)
them easily get my cabal iam not shiny (10:06 - 10:11)
okay rinse and repeat because they don't (10:09 - 10:14)
care about their streak or their (10:11 - 10:17)
win-loss ratio I had no idea they were (10:14 - 10:18)
giving away Pokemon as part of the (10:17 - 10:21)
battle League yes it's the only way (10:18 - 10:23)
right now to get scraggy rough 'let it (10:21 - 10:25)
is one way to get cabal Ian if you don't (10:23 - 10:26)
want to do raids (10:25 - 10:30)
I think Gera Tina isn't it or wasn't it (10:26 - 10:32)
I think it was I think it's been (10:30 - 10:34)
replaced with cabal Ian's right now um (10:32 - 10:37)
but that's how I got my co Balian is go (10:34 - 10:39)
Baddeley guy got lucky and i actually (10:37 - 10:42)
faced one of those players I did I was (10:39 - 10:45)
I'm in rank 6 rank 6 was ranked 7 before (10:42 - 10:48)
they start giving you a number and I (10:45 - 10:50)
faced the player that sent out a magic (10:48 - 10:53)
carpet and a Luvdisc (10:50 - 10:56)
and I was like this is weird and then I (10:53 - 10:57)
was like oh I bet they're purposely (10:56 - 11:01)
losing - did they tap no not at all they (10:57 - 11:03)
didn't do anything they just see yeah (11:01 - 11:06)
that's like they should monitor for (11:03 - 11:08)
people who don't tap at all through the (11:06 - 11:11)
entire battle and then those people like (11:08 - 11:12)
get knocked out or something like that (11:11 - 11:14)
if they're if the point is that they (11:12 - 11:17)
want people to actually battle although (11:14 - 11:19)
I can also understand only doing it for (11:17 - 11:20)
the rewards because there is no World (11:19 - 11:23)
Championships of Pokemon go battle (11:20 - 11:26)
league yet for the glory so there is no (11:23 - 11:28)
glory (11:26 - 11:28)
fYI just sent you an article inside the (11:29 - 11:36)
world of professional (11:34 - 11:38)
rock-paper-scissors own reading pleasure (11:36 - 11:41)
later perfect (11:38 - 11:44)
well they think so do you think well (11:41 - 11:48)
part of this is because there's no limit (11:44 - 11:50)
to how many times you can do go battle (11:48 - 11:54)
yeah so if they were to get to the point (11:50 - 11:56)
where they can read add back the walking (11:54 - 11:57)
which I don't think the walking (11:56 - 11:59)
requirement is that steep honestly I (11:57 - 12:02)
think you're less likely to see people (11:59 - 12:05)
just throwing matches because now those (12:02 - 12:08)
people have to just walk then throw the (12:05 - 12:10)
matches then walk some more and that (12:08 - 12:12)
seems like a lot more work and at that (12:10 - 12:14)
point if you're only in it for cabal iam (12:12 - 12:18)
cheese and people are outside once again (12:14 - 12:20)
it just seems like doing one Co Balian (12:18 - 12:21)
right is probably easier than walking (12:20 - 12:24)
losing five matches walking losing five (12:21 - 12:25)
matches and then getting to a point (12:24 - 12:27)
where you can win two or three matches (12:25 - 12:30)
in a row to get what you're looking for (12:27 - 12:33)
I know I walked seven miles yesterday (12:30 - 12:37)
there was any of people outside when I (12:33 - 12:40)
was up for st. Louis this day I think it (12:37 - 12:42)
will slow it down I don't think it will (12:40 - 12:46)
stop it I mean and why would it is that (12:42 - 12:51)
there are exclusive rewards that are (12:46 - 12:55)
locked behind winning or losing and it (12:51 - 12:57)
we saw this we see this in a lot of (12:55 - 12:59)
different games it's easier to be seen (12:57 - 13:03)
even in VG C's it's easier to drop your (12:59 - 13:06)
ranking down to get a bunch of easy (13:03 - 13:10)
opponents in a row than it is to try to (13:06 - 13:13)
go past sort of (13:10 - 13:16)
the up that that that borderline where (13:13 - 13:18)
people start really knowing what they're (13:16 - 13:20)
doing and even if you have to walk (13:18 - 13:23)
people who just want those rewards are (13:20 - 13:26)
are gonna do it because it's just way (13:23 - 13:30)
easier it just is I don't know that it's (13:26 - 13:33)
like necessarily a bad thing like I (13:30 - 13:35)
would argue that it's ruining the (13:33 - 13:37)
experience but it's not much of an (13:35 - 13:40)
experience we have only real reward the (13:37 - 13:42)
only real thing for doing is getting the (13:40 - 13:45)
reward so if people want to give X (13:42 - 13:47)
amount of people easier wins to get (13:45 - 13:50)
towards that reward so that later they (13:47 - 13:52)
can have easier wins to get to that same (13:50 - 13:54)
reward it's not like the worst thing (13:52 - 13:56)
that's ever happened it's not if both (13:54 - 14:02)
players are trying to throw them has to (13:56 - 14:04)
realize it and take the win it's mostly (14:02 - 14:06)
just against the spirit of the (14:04 - 14:09)
competition right it's like you're (14:06 - 14:11)
supposed to be doing this because you (14:09 - 14:15)
want to be the best not because you want (14:11 - 14:19)
rewards but there's no no glory for (14:15 - 14:22)
being the best so there is that trapping (14:19 - 14:27)
I'm the best at tapping my phone all (14:22 - 14:28)
right some other Pokemon good news here (14:27 - 14:29)
this is this is the good stuff (14:28 - 14:32)
this is the good stuff now I had the (14:29 - 14:36)
good stuff on Friday oh this is actually (14:32 - 14:38)
off the Silk Road subreddit which was (14:36 - 14:42)
pulled from a tweet our Mac 18 verified (14:38 - 14:45)
user on Twitter but I mean they just (14:42 - 14:47)
used a website they are a senior tech (14:45 - 14:49)
reporter from BuzzFeed they just use the (14:47 - 14:52)
website to track this but Pokemon Go app (14:49 - 14:56)
changes their bio so their old bio said (14:52 - 14:59)
step outside and discover Pokemon in the (14:56 - 15:03)
real world follow us for updates get up (14:59 - 15:07)
and go it now says discover Pokemon in (15:03 - 15:11)
the real world follow us or Pokemon go (15:07 - 15:13)
updates (15:11 - 15:13)
[Music] (15:14 - 15:19)
everydays have changed just a Twitter (15:15 - 15:23)
bio I mean yo we can't you can't go out (15:19 - 15:26)
right now I wonder if they were worried (15:23 - 15:29)
about like legal stuff I would say less (15:26 - 15:33)
legal stuff and more what where we are (15:29 - 15:37)
right now in sort of socially being (15:33 - 15:40)
worried about being insensitive yeah and (15:37 - 15:43)
like somebody then turning around and (15:40 - 15:44)
saying well you're encouraging people to (15:43 - 15:46)
go outside and there we go out and (15:44 - 15:48)
they're not suppose you know what my (15:46 - 15:50)
Minnesota governor told me I'm supposed (15:48 - 15:52)
to go outside so I don't know what the (15:50 - 15:54)
issue is people my governor also said (15:52 - 15:56)
you feel free to go to the park just you (15:54 - 15:59)
know keep your space which people aren't (15:56 - 16:01)
doing I was so mad on Friday I'm like (15:59 - 16:04)
get away from me i mmm I could I don't (16:01 - 16:06)
want this to be the discussion of the (16:04 - 16:08)
day but boy oh boy Greg I am so with you (16:06 - 16:13)
on that like get over at your site of (16:08 - 16:15)
that of this path I realize we have to (16:13 - 16:18)
pass to each other but move to the side (16:15 - 16:21)
the psychic-type of n is also going on (16:18 - 16:24)
in Pokemon go yep so yeah I gotta get (16:21 - 16:27)
out rig that wow I never found a giraffe (16:24 - 16:29)
rig I got a ton of solo sis and made my (16:27 - 16:32)
reuni CLIs that last that will last (16:29 - 16:35)
until I think Tuesday evening the lugia (16:32 - 16:37)
hoo event was canceled this cancelled (16:35 - 16:40)
this past weekend as well so Greg will (16:37 - 16:41)
and I were supposed to go to st. Louis (16:40 - 16:45)
together and that was canceled correct (16:41 - 16:49)
and rightly so I decided to stream it (16:45 - 16:51)
from my house to see how good it would (16:49 - 16:54)
be from my house I was well aware that (16:51 - 16:56)
probably getting up and moving even if (16:54 - 16:59)
it was in a car would probably be a (16:56 - 17:01)
better way to play it but I was really (16:59 - 17:03)
curious what the event would be like for (17:01 - 17:05)
somebody who couldn't have that and so I (17:03 - 17:08)
ended up playing 78 hours I missed the (17:05 - 17:11)
first hour and it was okay I mean I (17:08 - 17:13)
ended up with two shinies the event does (17:11 - 17:16)
guarantee you of third shiny or our (17:13 - 17:18)
guaranteed shiny which I guess was the (17:16 - 17:19)
third one I got which was teddiursa (17:18 - 17:23)
yep they did make the event (17:19 - 17:25)
they did a couple cool things number one (17:23 - 17:28)
is it was cool that they were able to (17:25 - 17:31)
give players on those days that they (17:28 - 17:33)
planned for because keep in mind if you (17:31 - 17:36)
bought a ticket in January you probably (17:33 - 17:39)
took those days off and planned some (17:36 - 17:42)
sort of trip around it so most people (17:39 - 17:45)
you know at that point probably still (17:42 - 17:46)
had that weekend available to them and (17:45 - 17:50)
so it was cool that they did something (17:46 - 17:52)
for those people it was also cool that (17:50 - 17:56)
like the event what asks for the event (17:52 - 18:00)
did give you they gave you 200 great (17:56 - 18:01)
balls which is awesome and they were (18:00 - 18:03)
really easy I think one was like yeah (18:01 - 18:06)
evolved five Pokemon or something and (18:03 - 18:08)
then like give your buddy a treat and I (18:06 - 18:11)
don't know catch one grass type or (18:08 - 18:13)
something it was super easy and then (18:11 - 18:14)
when you cash it in you got 100 great (18:13 - 18:16)
balls and then the next set of tasks was (18:14 - 18:19)
like give your buddy 3 3 treats pet your (18:16 - 18:21)
buddy take a picture everybody and then (18:19 - 18:22)
you got another 100 great balls and then (18:21 - 18:24)
when you completed that you got a shiny (18:22 - 18:27)
teddiursa so giving you 200 great balls (18:24 - 18:30)
pretty great I plan for the event so I (18:27 - 18:33)
the day before the event started I went (18:30 - 18:36)
to the park slowly drove through a very (18:33 - 18:38)
empty park and spun all the stops to (18:36 - 18:40)
stock up on pokeballs so I went into the (18:38 - 18:43)
event with 600 pokeballs I ended the (18:40 - 18:44)
event with about a hundred pokeballs and (18:43 - 18:46)
like zero great balls and Sewer ultra (18:44 - 18:48)
balls and I had about started the event (18:46 - 18:50)
with about a hundred great and 100 ultra (18:48 - 18:52)
didn't have to buy anything I didn't (18:50 - 18:54)
have to buy any more pokeballs overall (18:52 - 18:57)
I'd only went to the event with 100 (18:54 - 18:59)
pokeballs you probably ran out like an (18:57 - 19:01)
hour or if you didn't have friends to (18:59 - 19:04)
open gifts from but the the spawns were (19:01 - 19:06)
non-stop I think about every 30 seconds (19:04 - 19:07)
it changed if you didn't catch it yeah (19:06 - 19:10)
if he didn't catch it that was that was (19:07 - 19:12)
the thing that I had to get used to (19:10 - 19:15)
because I had my incense up but and then (19:12 - 19:18)
I was also walking and so when I would (19:15 - 19:20)
see something like oh I'm gonna catch (19:18 - 19:21)
that and then the thing that just popped (19:20 - 19:24)
my incense ooh I can't wait I'll catch (19:21 - 19:25)
that one quick cuz I really wanted to (19:24 - 19:27)
get this one and by the time I'd caught (19:25 - 19:28)
the other one and come back it had (19:27 - 19:30)
switched to a different because it was (19:28 - 19:33)
on like in every it felt more like 20 (19:30 - 19:35)
seconds but it was probably 30 where it (19:33 - 19:37)
would just pop into a different one (19:35 - 19:39)
was so confusing for me too well I would (19:37 - 19:41)
like literately hook on one thing and (19:39 - 19:43)
then it like when it appeared it would (19:41 - 19:45)
be something completely different and (19:43 - 19:47)
then for players who had to take it they (19:45 - 19:50)
gave you one did you have to activate (19:47 - 19:52)
your incense incense or did it (19:50 - 19:55)
automatically now I had to I had I (19:52 - 19:57)
activated mine but then it lasts eight (19:55 - 19:59)
hours it even lasted after the event it (19:57 - 20:01)
just it was just eight hours total yep (19:59 - 20:03)
cuz I had an extra hour even but it was (20:01 - 20:05)
it was confusing because the timer (20:03 - 20:08)
didn't say eight hours one hour and it (20:05 - 20:11)
just kept resetting I was like oh no (20:08 - 20:13)
yeah I wondered yeah that seems like a (20:11 - 20:13)
weird (20:13 - 20:15)
there's probably they probably did it (20:13 - 20:18)
cuz it was easy but right it was (20:15 - 20:19)
confusing at first of like is this (20:18 - 20:21)
supposed to reset on its own the other (20:19 - 20:23)
thing is like the event broke midway (20:21 - 20:26)
through and it turned into nothing but (20:23 - 20:30)
soul OSIS for two hours oh you were (20:26 - 20:32)
supposed to get at like oddish teddiursa (20:30 - 20:37)
lunatone Snivy ferrata my chatot unknown (20:32 - 20:39)
and I was getting at all of those like (20:37 - 20:43)
non-stop for I started at 11:00 until (20:39 - 20:45)
about one o'clock and then I was getting (20:43 - 20:48)
nothing but cirrhosis I I counted I got (20:45 - 20:50)
eleven soul OSIS in a row often in Scent (20:48 - 20:52)
then like a teddy or something like (20:50 - 20:54)
another ten soul OSIS and I was talking (20:52 - 20:57)
to I was streaming on Twitch and I was (20:54 - 20:58)
talking people in chat and they were (20:57 - 20:59)
like yeah we were getting a variety of (20:58 - 21:01)
psychic pokémon but now we're getting (20:59 - 21:03)
nothing but soul OSIS because they cuz (21:01 - 21:05)
people not participating in the event (21:03 - 21:08)
they were seeing like drowsies and goth (21:05 - 21:10)
ITA's and execute and slowpoke but then (21:08 - 21:12)
they also got nothing but celosia sand (21:10 - 21:14)
it was like about two hours then all of (21:12 - 21:16)
a sudden it was like no morsel OSIS and (21:14 - 21:17)
it was like back to lunatone and pikachu (21:16 - 21:20)
and stuff so I'm not sure what bro what (21:17 - 21:22)
broke it's not it's not a complaint to (21:20 - 21:24)
be like I'll I want my money back it was (21:22 - 21:27)
frustrating for sure but also I guess (21:24 - 21:29)
now I have enough for two reuni classes (21:27 - 21:33)
yeah I went to my park up by me which is (21:29 - 21:35)
the art park so there's a lot of stops (21:33 - 21:38)
in a very in a very small circle because (21:35 - 21:41)
it's not a huge park and things (21:38 - 21:44)
responding there on a pretty pretty (21:41 - 21:45)
solid clip (21:44 - 21:48)
I was fairly impressed I walked away (21:45 - 21:52)
with three shiny teddiursa two shiny (21:48 - 21:54)
Luna tones and the reason why I'm (21:52 - 21:57)
announcing my retirement from Pokemon go (21:54 - 22:00)
to shiny Rosalia my family it happened (21:57 - 22:04)
I've won the game no I do not need to (22:00 - 22:06)
continue now you can force lose all your (22:04 - 22:10)
battles yeah to get nothing I don't need (22:06 - 22:11)
anything mommy get when I come Teddy (22:10 - 22:13)
IRS's wait you already got a shiny teddy (22:11 - 22:17)

my purple roses no no I said yeah you (22:17 - 22:22)
came out my purple Roselia for I need (22:20 - 22:25)
four to stop reading more yeah see and I (22:22 - 22:28)
need three shiny earth too dear says to (22:25 - 22:30)
breed more let's see how that feels (22:28 - 22:32)
yeah I said you could take the white (22:30 - 22:37)
roses let me in I also didn't try so I (22:32 - 22:39)
think I think it was important for them (22:37 - 22:41)
to acknowledge and do this event because (22:39 - 22:43)
while they did not cancel it and they (22:41 - 22:46)
only postponed it I don't know if I can (22:43 - 22:48)
go to whatever the new date is and like (22:46 - 22:50)
it could be the same weekend you guys (22:48 - 22:52)
are going to Gen Con it could be a (22:50 - 22:55)
weekend where you know I'm in Seattle or (22:52 - 22:56)
I'm in at twitchcon like I don't know (22:55 - 23:00)
when this new date is yeah I mean I will (22:56 - 23:03)
say like I spent two hours has been an (23:00 - 23:04)
hour in the morning at home to see what (23:03 - 23:07)
it was like at home and then I drove to (23:04 - 23:09)
the park and spent an hour there with (23:07 - 23:12)
way too many people and it was fine like (23:09 - 23:16)
I really wish my biggest complaint is (23:12 - 23:19)
the fact that I didn't have like any of (23:16 - 23:22)
the my friends there because obviously (23:19 - 23:25)
prepare hue many reasons that's not (23:22 - 23:27)
possible right now so like it was less (23:25 - 23:29)
fun and I didn't spend as much time on (23:27 - 23:31)
it because it was just me doing it in my (23:29 - 23:33)
house and then me doing in the park with (23:31 - 23:34)
people who don't understand what (23:33 - 23:40)
six-feet means but yeah I mean it was (23:34 - 23:41)
fine it was fine for a fill-in event (23:40 - 23:44)
I feel like given the circumstances they (23:41 - 23:48)
did something that rewarded enough like (23:44 - 23:50)
I got a bunch of Snivy I love Snivy I (23:48 - 23:54)
got a bunch of solo sasai the years like (23:50 - 23:57)
I got a bunch of chatot so people can I (23:54 - 23:59)
got them so people who couldn't do it I (23:57 - 24:00)
can trade (23:59 - 24:04)
I only saw two unknowns I got Elle and I (24:00 - 24:07)
I think hmm yeah I got an eye that's all (24:04 - 24:08)
I got frozen's (24:07 - 24:10)
I was missing tea and I was able to find (24:08 - 24:13)
two teas so but other than that I was (24:10 - 24:15)
like okay I you know for a for a (24:13 - 24:18)
last-minute feeling event it was it was (24:15 - 24:20)
better than I expected but certainly not (24:18 - 24:23)
like super great but yeah I got my two (24:20 - 24:24)
shiny (24:23 - 24:26)
Rosalia and that was probably the (24:24 - 24:28)
highlight of that whole hour of walking (24:26 - 24:31)
around as I go it's fine finally I (24:28 - 24:33)
didn't go anywhere I did it from my (24:31 - 24:37)
office with my pokeball plus but I did (24:33 - 24:41)
end up with a shiny meditite oh the (24:37 - 24:46)
weird Pikachu with a fedora is yeah he's (24:41 - 24:48)
got on his head bowler hat Pikachu I (24:46 - 24:51)
don't know what I'm doing a Pikachu - (24:48 - 24:55)
yeah the most well I'll trade it to you (24:51 - 24:57)

when I log in I get three alert thing (27:15 - 27:23)
yeah yeah so are there items that are (27:19 - 27:26)
specific to this event that if I don't (27:23 - 27:28)
use them during this event they get (27:26 - 27:30)
converted into other items no I don't (27:28 - 27:33)
think for this one okay because I had (27:30 - 27:36)
that happen I think for the mutilation (27:33 - 27:41)
oak event oh yeah I haven't run into (27:36 - 27:44)
them but I will admit since working from (27:41 - 27:46)
home I found that I don't play mobile (27:44 - 27:50)
games at home when I have better systems (27:46 - 27:52)
so I haven't really delved into this but (27:50 - 27:55)
I if it's it sounds like it's like the (27:52 - 27:57)
Rotom allies event (27:55 - 27:58)
yeah we're in which there weren't (27:57 - 28:02)
specific items to level just that those (27:58 - 28:04)
characters I haven't run into it in this (28:02 - 28:07)
but I will freely admit I also haven't (28:04 - 28:10)
played it I usually in the press (28:07 - 28:12)
announcements they say these events or (28:10 - 28:16)
in the banners if you go into the store (28:12 - 28:19)
they'll have unique things and I haven't (28:16 - 28:21)
seen that let me let me pop it open (28:19 - 28:22)
since I haven't gathered my gems yet (28:21 - 28:25)
today that you don't do that first thing (28:22 - 28:28)
in the morning no I got (28:25 - 28:29)
Crossy to play first thing in the (28:28 - 28:31)
morning there's a three-three banners (28:29 - 28:34)
right now there's the Sabrina Scout Plus (28:31 - 28:35)
present banner (28:34 - 28:38)
there's the fan Tina pres the Bret (28:35 - 28:39)
banner no present and then there's (28:38 - 28:42)
plumeria and Guzman under the same (28:39 - 28:45)
banner and Kuzma and plumeria both have (28:42 - 28:48)
a 1% poll rate whereas fan Tina and (28:45 - 28:51)
Sabrina have a 2% poll rate so they did (28:48 - 28:55)
they did split that for for those (28:51 - 28:57)
characters which I don't know if I love (28:55 - 28:58)
her or not (28:57 - 29:01)
yeah I would rather pull on a 2% Guzman (28:58 - 29:04)
to be honest there isn't in the exchange (29:01 - 29:07)
items the only unique item event that's (29:04 - 29:08)
running right now is the ghost type (29:07 - 29:11)
training event so I would say that (29:08 - 29:15)
there's not item specific for the team (29:11 - 29:19)
skull event can we clear up another (29:15 - 29:21)
piece of confusion I have about this (29:19 - 29:25)
game sure yes okay so I opened the game (29:21 - 29:29)
it blasts horns in my ear and it didn't (29:25 - 29:32)
like I talked to somebody Brock tells me (29:29 - 29:35)
that he got in some good workout routine (29:32 - 29:36)
this morning or something I don't know (29:35 - 29:40)
and then it pops up and it says you get (29:36 - 29:43)

already two really good bug Pokemon in (31:57 - 32:01)
here and they're not a lot of great (32:00 - 32:05)
poison ones I mean the fire is there are (32:01 - 32:07)
so many fire types in this game for how (32:05 - 32:09)
little they are actually Pokemon in the (32:07 - 32:11)
actual games I feel like I do want to (32:09 - 32:13)
pull on this banner and I have the gems (32:11 - 32:16)
to do so but man I feel like the second (32:13 - 32:18)

lost thunder and I also see behind his (37:27 - 37:33)
pack of sword and shield it looks like (37:31 - 37:38)
they snuck in an XY evolutions oh I (37:33 - 37:43)
cannot confirm or deny crimson invasion (37:38 - 37:47)
is in this it's not looking like it it (37:43 - 37:50)
looks like one base set sun and moon one (37:47 - 37:53)
celestial storm two cosmic eclipse two (37:50 - 37:56)
sword and shield 1 XY evolutions and one (37:53 - 38:01)

what is the ok I'm looking at the (38:10 - 38:14)
pictures and I don't know any other (38:12 - 38:16)
think I would I think I would take XY (38:14 - 38:18)
evolutions over yes that's not even a (38:16 - 38:20)
question I would a hundred percent takes (38:18 - 38:21)
at taking XY evolutions over crimson (38:20 - 38:24)
invasion what's in X Y evolutions you (38:21 - 38:26)
could at least get like base at (38:24 - 38:29)
Charizard ok yes (38:26 - 38:31)
and you can get like full art Brock's (38:29 - 38:33)
grit and you can get like full art misty (38:31 - 38:36)
which aren't like worth a lot but at (38:33 - 38:38)
least they're like super pretty but yeah (38:36 - 38:40)
you can get basic Charizard you got a (38:38 - 38:45)
full art chiseled you got special car (38:40 - 38:48)
card right oh yeah yeah I ended up (38:45 - 38:52)
pulling the gold the Sachi and V it was (38:48 - 38:54)
crazy too because I pulled Sachi and V (38:52 - 38:58)
like the day before so for those that (38:54 - 39:01)
may not be familiar on Twitch every now (38:58 - 39:03)
and then I'll open booster packs on (39:01 - 39:04)
stream usually like two or three booster (39:03 - 39:06)
packs a day in the middle of the stream (39:04 - 39:09)
and so like a couple days ago I opens a (39:06 - 39:11)
chien and I like freaked out Kizashi ins (39:09 - 39:13)
one of the decision is the best card of (39:11 - 39:17)
that set Sachi and V and then like two (39:13 - 39:20)
days later I pulled the the all gold (39:17 - 39:23)
version of za she and V which I actually (39:20 - 39:25)
might send in to get it rated because I (39:23 - 39:27)
think if you grade it and it grades that (39:25 - 39:29)
like a nine or a ten it's worth like 200 (39:27 - 39:32)
bucks gotta start selling pokemon cards (39:29 - 39:45)

read description come on I want complete (41:33 - 41:42)
that I did find a article from us gamer (41:37 - 41:46)

changed it to my load like like it's (45:26 - 45:31)
always been my letting I just wish they (45:28 - 45:34)
would have consistency because all they (45:31 - 45:36)
literally need is for the Pokedex to say (45:34 - 45:38)
these pokemons names that's all they (45:36 - 45:42)
have to do yeah languages no one could (45:38 - 45:44)
possibly debate it because like every (45:42 - 45:47)
time I hear the argument it's like I saw (45:44 - 45:49)
somebody make the argument Nintendo (45:47 - 45:51)
doesn't know actual Pokemon (45:49 - 45:57)
pronunciation like what you can't trust (45:51 - 46:00)
the Nintendo Direct well if you can't (45:57 - 46:01)
trust the Nintendo Direct who are we (46:00 - 46:03)
trusting at this point because these are (46:01 - 46:05)
the same people they're like all you (46:03 - 46:07)
can't trust the anime well if you can't (46:05 - 46:09)
trust the anime and you can't trust the (46:07 - 46:11)
pokedex 3d app and you can't trust the (46:09 - 46:14)
detective PK like I don't who who are we (46:11 - 46:17)
supposed to trust mr. M I'm very upset (46:14 - 46:19)
that like it's called now intelligent (46:17 - 46:24)
like oh my gosh it's like Adam anyways (46:19 - 46:27)
that's my daily rant for the show but (46:24 - 46:35)
what were we talking about yeah no (46:27 - 46:38)
you're right Greg like Charmeleon (46:35 - 46:40)
kecleon in telly and they all have (46:38 - 46:43)
different they all end with a yawn this (46:40 - 46:44)
one is more frustrating cuz it's (46:43 - 46:46)
supposed to also be based off of a (46:44 - 46:50)
chameleon so if you're gonna say like (46:46 - 46:54)
kecleon who is 100% of chameleons should (46:50 - 46:55)
then be changed (46:54 - 46:59)
yeah but kecleon sounds so weird are we (46:55 - 47:02)
saying kecleon wrong is it kecleon no (46:59 - 47:04)
call up the 3ds (47:02 - 47:08)
oh it's charged let me take a look okay (47:04 - 47:11)
let's charge it's ready to go for this (47:08 - 47:13)
podcast all right well let's do (47:11 - 47:15)
Charmeleon - I'll start with Jeremy Lin (47:13 - 47:17)
because it's easier (47:15 - 47:23)
do that sweet music termi lien yeah (47:17 - 47:27)
in tele in I guess those are similar (47:23 - 47:30)
[Music] (47:27 - 47:34)
[Laughter] (47:30 - 47:38)
Nintendo get it together quit now front (47:34 - 47:40)
they they don't know they don't know how (47:38 - 47:42)
the Pokemon I am sorry pretty yeah (47:40 - 47:43)
they've they've never they've never (47:42 - 47:45)
there they haven't had enough time with (47:43 - 47:48)
the Pokemon franchise no there's 890 and (47:45 - 47:50)
the person that figures out (47:48 - 47:52)
pronunciation stopped carrying it around (47:50 - 47:59)
151 oh boy I get ready for Giganta max (47:52 - 48:01)
take over and pokemon sword and shield (47:59 - 48:03)
as gigantic versions of Charizard garbo (48:01 - 48:06)
derp kappa raja how did we say this (48:03 - 48:10)
Doral Adan Doral awashed (48:06 - 48:13)
will be a more a frequent more (48:10 - 48:14)
frequently appearing in max trade (48:13 - 48:17)
battles until April 27th heading to the (48:14 - 48:18)
wild area to search for these elusive (48:17 - 48:22)
Giganta max Pokemon two challenges (48:18 - 48:23)
pokemon in a max raid battle you need to (48:22 - 48:25)
connect your Nintendo switch system to (48:23 - 48:27)
the internet when you see a pillar of (48:25 - 48:28)
light shining in a den you can walk up (48:27 - 48:30)
to it and interact to emit racks red (48:28 - 48:33)
rattle I've a gigantic max Pokemon are (48:30 - 48:34)
appearing more frequently in max berry (48:33 - 48:37)
battles you will encounter one you will (48:34 - 48:39)
sometimes encounter one of them instead (48:37 - 48:41)
of a Dynomax Pokemon outside of these (48:39 - 48:43)
special time periods encountering (48:41 - 48:46)
Giganta Max Pokemon eggs extremely rare (48:43 - 48:48)
unless you know how to move your clock (48:46 - 48:50)
forward don't wait (48:48 - 48:52)
you don't want to miss out on your (48:50 - 48:56)
chance okay so the weird thing here in (48:52 - 48:57)
this press release where I've read that (48:56 - 48:59)
off Pokemon comm is in the Nintendo Mini (48:57 - 49:03)
direct they actually say out loud that (48:59 - 49:07)
kappa Raja and Doral Adhan will be (49:03 - 49:11)
appearing more frequently in sword and (49:07 - 49:14)
Charizard and gar motor will be more (49:11 - 49:18)
frequently appearing in shield which (49:14 - 49:22)
Sara B and Bubba pedia have the odds for (49:18 - 49:24)
that pretty much all for Pokemon appear (49:22 - 49:25)
in 3 to 4 star raids (49:24 - 49:27)
I also made a graphic about this but (49:25 - 49:30)
specifically 5 star raids are limited (49:27 - 49:33)
car motor Charizard to shield and then (49:30 - 49:36)
the other two to sword so it is possible (49:33 - 49:38)
to get all four in both gameplay in one (49:36 - 49:40)
game it's just if you specifically (49:38 - 49:43)
wanted five star the five stars were (49:40 - 49:46)
more limited so you'd be easier as a (49:43 - 49:48)
shield player to find garb order or (49:46 - 49:50)
Charizard but still possible to find the (49:48 - 49:52)
other two but that's the same thing they (49:50 - 49:57)
did for ma champion Gengar yes it was (49:52 - 49:58)
also the same thing they did for the elk (49:57 - 50:02)
Remy where certain flavors of Aughrim II (49:58 - 50:05)
were more easy to find in specific stars (50:02 - 50:07)
I think I think Mint was only in three (50:05 - 50:11)
and five stars and Rubik's swirl was (50:07 - 50:14)
only in five and vanilla was only in two (50:11 - 50:18)
or something like that they the Nintendo (50:14 - 50:22)
mini direct also showed off the moves (50:18 - 50:25)
the Giganta max moves that intellagen (50:22 - 50:29)
rila boom and cinder ace do and I (50:25 - 50:33)
believe they all do the same moves that (50:29 - 50:35)
well all their moves are different in (50:33 - 50:37)
the sense of like they look different (50:35 - 50:41)
but I think that all - they all have the (50:37 - 50:44)
same effect which i think is it disables (50:41 - 50:47)
the other pokemons ability oh that's (50:44 - 50:48)
cool (50:47 - 50:52)
yes one when used the opponents (50:48 - 50:54)
abilities have no effect when attacking (50:52 - 50:57)
that's how they worded it exactly there (50:54 - 50:58)
were some other things that they (50:57 - 50:59)
announced at the end of the incentive (50:58 - 51:01)
direct if you did not watch it if you (50:59 - 51:03)
actually go to our youtube channel (51:01 - 51:06)
youtube.com such P came and cast you can (51:03 - 51:08)

past new downloadable content for sword (53:45 - 53:49)
and shield will contain both the island (53:47 - 53:51)
of armor and the crown Tundra two (53:49 - 53:53)
separate adventures where you will be (53:51 - 53:55)
able to meet new characters catch new (53:53 - 53:58)
Pokemon Explorer it does catch new (53:55 - 53:59)
discovered Pokemon so I don't know how (53:58 - 54:01)
many new Pokemon and explore new areas (53:59 - 54:04)
of the gala region the island of armor (54:01 - 54:05)
is still scheduled to be released at the (54:04 - 54:09)
end of June 2020 and the catch crown (54:05 - 54:13)
Tundra fall of 2020 so if I move my (54:09 - 54:18)
calendar to June I'm gonna say June 26 (54:13 - 54:21)
that is the last possible Friday in June (54:18 - 54:23)
that was that would be my guess (54:21 - 54:26)
sounds about right yep well if III was (54:23 - 54:31)
suppose to be what June 8th 9th and 10th (54:26 - 54:34)
and the e3 got canceled they were to (54:31 - 54:36)
probably I mean I guess it could be the (54:34 - 54:39)
12th 19th or 26 but I'm assuming at e3 (54:36 - 54:41)
there would have probably been a trailer (54:39 - 54:42)
for this to high people up saying it's (54:41 - 54:45)
coming in a week or two I'm sure that (54:42 - 54:47)
Nintendo Direct will still exist that (54:45 - 54:50)
week because Nintendo I mean they can do (54:47 - 54:52)
the treehouse of terror from anywhere (54:50 - 54:54)
yeah correct yeah they can they can (54:52 - 54:56)
treehouse when wherever they want they (54:54 - 54:57)
could be tree housing right now and pre (54:56 - 55:01)
recording it getting it ready does this (54:57 - 55:03)
talk about ursu I don't think this press (55:01 - 55:06)
release does oddly enough I mean it did (55:03 - 55:08)
say you can catch a new pope yeah that's (55:06 - 55:08)
true (55:08 - 55:10)
um so I guess I don't know if you guys (55:08 - 55:13)
saw the Nintendo Direct I did I did not (55:10 - 55:17)
okay so when they do show the island of (55:13 - 55:20)
armor they show the the guy who trained (55:17 - 55:23)
Leon I don't remember his name but the (55:20 - 55:25)
game says like when you train at the (55:23 - 55:27)
dojo which is probably the the story (55:25 - 55:28)
part of it you will receive the (55:27 - 55:32)
legendary Pokemon cub foo mustard that's (55:28 - 55:34)
the name and then there are two (55:32 - 55:38)
different towers on the island one is (55:34 - 55:41)
called the Tower of fists the Tower of (55:38 - 55:44)
two fists oh sorry both towers are (55:41 - 55:46)
called the towers of two fist one is a (55:44 - 55:49)
water tower and one is a darkness tower (55:46 - 55:51)
and so depending on which tower you go (55:49 - 55:56)
into is how come foo will evolve into a (55:51 - 55:59)
Shifu depending on the style so I (55:56 - 56:01)
believe once you go into a tower the (55:59 - 56:03)
other tower will lock you out and (56:01 - 56:06)
greninja will be at the top of both is (56:03 - 56:08)
that what we're picking up here dark (56:06 - 56:11)
powder oh I didn't think of that (56:08 - 56:16)
yeah probably no one is dark in one his (56:11 - 56:18)
water may be grinning just the final one (56:16 - 56:20)
in box yeah (56:18 - 56:23)
it covers both the other thing is near (56:20 - 56:26)
the end of the trailer they show the new (56:23 - 56:28)
slowpoke and they show them running (56:26 - 56:32)
super fast out of the building which is (56:28 - 56:35)
weird cuz slowpoke is really slow also (56:32 - 56:38)
yes so I'm not sure I'm not sure what (56:35 - 56:41)
that signifies I'm much because the (56:38 - 56:46)
slowpoke in the train station that you (56:41 - 56:48)
catch definitely acts like a slowpoke (56:46 - 56:52)
maybe they were scared Journal in rush (56:48 - 56:55)
yeah book in it I guess (56:52 - 56:58)
well you got time for Giganta max (56:55 - 56:59)
Charizard gar border kappa raja (56:58 - 57:03)
derp derp a Ladon dural udon i don't (56:59 - 57:04)
know how does i can't i can't remember (57:03 - 57:05)
how they I got a well I'll get it (57:04 - 57:06)
eventually (57:05 - 57:10)
three days Doral Adan if you need people (57:06 - 57:12)
to raid with I'm still playing Pokemon (57:10 - 57:13)
I'm playing a lot of animal crossing (57:12 - 57:15)
night I'm yeah Monday night right night (57:13 - 57:17)
so will your writing Monday evening for (57:15 - 57:19)
some Charizard xand gar boaters and (57:17 - 57:21)
stuff so if you want to swing by the (57:19 - 57:23)
stream and raid with some other people (57:21 - 57:25)
otherwise this is exactly what's gonna (57:23 - 57:27)
happen in about three weeks when this is (57:25 - 57:29)
ending people are gonna be like I didn't (57:27 - 57:30)
get any of these and no one wants to (57:29 - 57:36)
rate anymore I try to keep to Monday (57:30 - 57:38)
night raid night can I also say I'm a (57:36 - 57:42)
little frustrated that the silhouette of (57:38 - 57:50)
giganta's Ord looks like not kiram (57:42 - 57:52)
or did wait the Dragons from ten five (57:50 - 57:54)
why can't I think of the name right now (57:52 - 57:57)
restaurant now it looks like Reshiram (57:54 - 57:59)
yeah yeah it's real administrating I (57:57 - 58:01)
guess I got a little excited I was like (57:59 - 58:03)
Russia Rams in the game and like oh no (58:01 - 58:05)
it's just gigazord (58:03 - 58:10)
yep Monday night 7:00 central I'm (58:05 - 58:12)
usually on I open up all my raids just (58:10 - 58:15)
to the public if you see it (58:12 - 58:19)
join me cuz I'll tell ya everybody says (58:15 - 58:22)
oh no do away with me I always have one (58:19 - 58:26)
spot where nobody's joined yup same here (58:22 - 58:28)
also just a heads up we've talked about (58:26 - 58:29)
this before cuz but I know they're (58:28 - 58:31)
they're probably new people listing the (58:29 - 58:34)
show and whatnot the code doesn't just (58:31 - 58:37)
work so unlike trading and battling (58:34 - 58:39)
where you're like here's my four digit (58:37 - 58:40)
code let's trade here's my four digit (58:39 - 58:43)
code let's battle it doesn't work for (58:40 - 58:45)
raids so what happens is the why comp (58:43 - 58:48)
specifically looks for people doing (58:45 - 58:52)
raids and it will intermix random people (58:48 - 58:57)
and your friends and so if you aren't (58:52 - 58:59)
friends with somebody you are hoping (58:57 - 59:02)
that then that random person is the (58:59 - 59:04)
person hosting the raid and then you (59:02 - 59:07)
enter a code which is almost never going (59:04 - 59:09)
to happen unless you have really good (59:07 - 59:12)
like server rng just sigh it's saying (59:09 - 59:13)
like hey i have a raid open here's my (59:12 - 59:16)
four digit code that doesn't work ideal (59:13 - 59:19)
you have to add people and then those (59:16 - 59:21)
people will appear on your why comm and (59:19 - 59:25)
then if will goes I have a four star (59:21 - 59:29)
copper Rajah the code is 1 1 1 1 then (59:25 - 59:31)
once you see will on your why comm (59:29 - 59:34)
because you are on his friends list then (59:31 - 59:36)
you can enter the 1 1 1 1 to join so (59:34 - 59:38)
just keep that in mind I know there are (59:36 - 59:40)
some people that are like I'm not no (59:38 - 59:41)
ones hosting raids or I can't see anyone (59:40 - 59:43)
right anyone's raids you you have to add (59:41 - 59:45)
other people so ideally if you're in (59:43 - 59:47)
slack or discord or if you're hanging (59:45 - 59:49)
out on Twitch feel free to post your (59:47 - 59:51)
friend code and have people add you also (59:49 - 59:53)
if you're adding some people add a (59:51 - 59:55)
couple more people because it's way (59:53 - 59:57)
easier to do with 4 humans than it is to (59:55 - 60:01)
humans soul rock and a Magikarp hey hey (59:57 - 60:03)
you got that right mmm so it just goes (60:01 - 60:07)
by quicker just basic human level common (60:03 - 60:10)
courtesy you don't get super salty when (60:07 - 60:12)
no one joins your garbage raids I'm not (60:10 - 60:14)
talking about garv owner I'm talking (60:12 - 60:17)
about your your your lunatone raids or (60:14 - 60:20)
your lantern raids don't be salty when (60:17 - 60:22)
people aren't joining if you're not (60:20 - 60:25)
joining their garbage raids as well (60:22 - 60:29)
although I will get salty when I start (60:25 - 60:33)
up any raid and my three humans bring (60:29 - 60:37)
two shiny mah champs and as Ossian like (60:33 - 60:39)
come on bring the think of type (60:37 - 60:41)
effectiveness here folks (60:39 - 60:44)
now people just flexing those shinies I (60:41 - 60:46)
don't mind doing garbage raids most of (60:44 - 60:47)
the time the garbage raids go way (60:46 - 60:49)
quicker than like a gigantic mechs (60:47 - 60:51)
Pokemon yeah and then you get an ability (60:49 - 60:53)
something or other (60:51 - 60:57)
yeah and or you just stock it up on TMS (60:53 - 60:58)
I feel like people seem to forget like (60:57 - 61:00)
you're still getting you're still (60:58 - 61:02)
getting reward I don't care about the (61:00 - 61:04)
Pokemon at this point but if I'm gonna (61:02 - 61:06)
cycle through my rates faster I'll do a (61:04 - 61:09)
two-star the do just to you know get rid (61:06 - 61:12)
of my five stars saying the Conda not G (61:09 - 61:14)
max that I don't want to do all right (61:12 - 61:19)
ah let's squeeze Pokemon a week in here (61:14 - 61:21)

I can't - max tough all right ready what (61:29 - 61:37)
is the what is the what's the question (61:33 - 61:42)
of the week Wow short and sweet (61:37 - 61:45)
there you go okay this one is from Chris (61:42 - 61:48)
in our slack community attic channel (61:45 - 61:51)
which modern replacements for HMS do you (61:48 - 61:54)
prefer a Lola's pokey rides pokum let's (61:51 - 61:57)
go secret techniques in in let's go (61:54 - 62:00)
peachy let's go easy or gallows road tom (61:57 - 62:04)
box and Rotom bike and flying taxi I (62:00 - 62:08)
preferred a Lola's poker IDEs cuz I (62:04 - 62:11)
liked feeling mark like it was more (62:08 - 62:13)
Pokemon based in the Pokemon world I (62:11 - 62:17)
just like that more Pokemon connection (62:13 - 62:20)
felt feel that I got from those I prefer (62:17 - 62:24)
the gala person because I absolutely (62:20 - 62:28)
hate having to watch the animation when (62:24 - 62:31)
I want to go someplace in a Lola oh the (62:28 - 62:33)
Charizard thing yeah and it's just like (62:31 - 62:37)
oh please and once again it's like you (62:33 - 62:39)
know and it's the same thing of like my (62:37 - 62:42)
whole original argument for well I (62:39 - 62:44)
actually preferred HM so that could (62:42 - 62:46)
apply them to my Pokemon and then it was (62:44 - 62:48)
my Pokemon that was doing the thing for (62:46 - 62:50)
me and not just a Pokemon that I was (62:48 - 62:54)
told to use kind of moves over to Galler (62:50 - 62:56)
I mean yes the the flying taxis with (62:54 - 62:59)
their weird rules of where they will and (62:56 - 63:06)
he'll not go that way okay but it's like (62:59 - 63:10)
it's my bike that I'm writing so now you (63:06 - 63:12)
know I I can kind of like appreciate (63:10 - 63:14)
that you know that it's my bike that's (63:12 - 63:16)
taking me out onto the water and (63:14 - 63:19)
everything so I prefer that keeps me in (63:16 - 63:22)
the moment a little better than having (63:19 - 63:25)
to like call on the Charizard that I you (63:22 - 63:27)
know would rather be flying on something (63:25 - 63:30)
else but that's fine I prefer the (63:27 - 63:33)
galleries of to the (63:30 - 63:36)
like some of a Lola stuff is just it's (63:33 - 63:38)
it's like a good it was a super good (63:36 - 63:41)
replacement to HMS but pulling out muds (63:38 - 63:44)
Dale to walk across four feet of rocky (63:41 - 63:46)
terrain to get to the other side was so (63:44 - 63:49)
tedious and that was just like away from (63:46 - 63:50)
them to like prevent you from (63:49 - 63:52)
progressing without being like you need (63:50 - 63:55)
muds Dale but even before that well I (63:52 - 63:58)
guess I guess you could go south of the (63:55 - 63:59)
mountain and see the rocky terrain and (63:58 - 64:01)
be like I can't cross this yet I have to (63:59 - 64:03)
beat Sophocles first but they could have (64:01 - 64:06)
just put like path closed where they did (64:03 - 64:07)
with every other part of a low lower (64:06 - 64:10)
it's like up we got paths closed got the (64:07 - 64:12)
tauros on the loose but I do I see you (64:10 - 64:16)
man I I did really think so for let's go (64:12 - 64:18)
Pikachu let's go Evie was so charming to (64:16 - 64:20)
see which Pokemon you could ride like (64:18 - 64:23)
riding Snorlax was so cool being on (64:20 - 64:25)
Persian or arcanine was really cool and (64:23 - 64:27)
I don't know a lot of people like miss (64:25 - 64:29)
the bike but I think riding on arcanine (64:27 - 64:32)
is way cooler than riding a bike but (64:29 - 64:34)
yeah but you could ride the Pokemon but (64:32 - 64:37)
they weren't the HMS yeah a secret (64:34 - 64:39)
technique techniques worst just cut (64:37 - 64:41)
screens for the most part right yeah (64:39 - 64:43)
looking like there was still cut in (64:41 - 64:45)
let's go Pikachu cuz they wanted to keep (64:43 - 64:47)
it somewhat faithful so that was a (64:45 - 64:48)
little bit annoying to be like well I so (64:47 - 64:50)
I gotta cut this bush to get to the (64:48 - 64:52)
other side but I prefer Galler stuff I (64:50 - 64:54)
mean just like I think the I think I (64:52 - 64:56)
like the bike more when I'll be able to (64:54 - 64:58)
customise the bike more in the DLC and (64:56 - 65:02)
then it will feel like my own bike and (64:58 - 65:04)
yeah I think the flying taxing is is (65:02 - 65:07)
fine edged I hate I hate I hate the bike (65:04 - 65:09)
outfits I hate the but I think I think (65:07 - 65:11)
there until I can get something that I (65:09 - 65:12)
like that looks better (65:11 - 65:17)
nah yeah and I don't like I think some (65:12 - 65:20)
of the complaints of a lola's hms are (65:17 - 65:24)
level design and not the actual system (65:20 - 65:26)
of using the pokemon like the fact that (65:24 - 65:29)
they decided to put in rocky ground and (65:26 - 65:35)
that only one type like cry wise choice (65:29 - 65:36)
is the same thing like you can't get (65:35 - 65:38)
across water on the bike until they (65:36 - 65:39)
somehow teach you how to put on (65:38 - 65:42)
inflatable wheels like it's the same (65:39 - 65:46)
bizarre gatekeeping you can't help do (65:42 - 65:47)
this until we (65:46 - 65:50)
teach you how to do this that exists in (65:47 - 65:53)
both is just it's the same well if you (65:50 - 65:55)
have a if so if you have a linear story (65:53 - 65:57)
you don't need to do that because you're (65:55 - 65:59)
forcing the character good to go down (65:57 - 66:00)
paths and they're not gonna see that (65:59 - 66:02)
stuff until they get there but if you (66:00 - 66:05)
have a more open game then you have to (66:02 - 66:08)
have this weird gatekeeping of like okay (66:05 - 66:09)
you can see that over there but you (66:08 - 66:10)
don't have the item to do that or you (66:09 - 66:13)
can go this way but only so far which (66:10 - 66:16)
was like the thing in in lets or the (66:13 - 66:18)
thing in sorting shield where it's like (66:16 - 66:20)
oh I can't go here yet because I need (66:18 - 66:23)
the bike and don't have that I think the (66:20 - 66:26)
game that did that the probably the best (66:23 - 66:29)
was what gen 2 where you could (66:26 - 66:31)
technically go to the like a rage before (66:29 - 66:32)
you did anything else or if you wanted (66:31 - 66:35)
to go the other way you could do that (66:32 - 66:40)
too I mean the T branch the the T branch (66:35 - 66:43)
is mostly a false choice because you (66:40 - 66:45)
could go that way and visit those things (66:43 - 66:48)
but the story events won't activate (66:45 - 66:49)
until you do them in the proper order (66:48 - 66:51)
yes you're gonna have to go back anyway (66:49 - 66:53)
so you have to go back anyways I mean (66:51 - 66:55)
there's there's that that's like the (66:53 - 66:57)
illusion of choice sure you can do it (66:55 - 67:02)
nothing activates and because they made (66:57 - 67:05)
the choice of giving in the illusion of (67:02 - 67:06)
choice (67:05 - 67:09)
those two routes had to be of the same (67:06 - 67:12)
level which made grinding in that game (67:09 - 67:15)
even worse like that's just that (67:12 - 67:18)
straight-up poor design no I agree it's (67:15 - 67:20)
it's like hey we give you choice you can (67:18 - 67:23)
go either way but not really because if (67:20 - 67:24)
you go this one way nothing's gonna (67:23 - 67:27)
happen yeah it's the same like old video (67:24 - 67:29)
game thing of like do you want to join (67:27 - 67:31)
my team yes or no and then no doesn't do (67:29 - 67:35)
anything and it's like at least some (67:31 - 67:38)
games gave you like a witty dialogue if (67:35 - 67:40)
you did like no two or three times in a (67:38 - 67:40)
row (67:40 - 67:42)
yeah but if you're not even going to go (67:40 - 67:43)
out of your way to give me something (67:42 - 67:47)
witty for pressing the other option that (67:43 - 67:48)
you gave me for the illusion of choice (67:47 - 67:50)
then why are you wasting might like why (67:48 - 67:52)
why why is this even just why is this a (67:50 - 67:54)
choice just let me do it like unless (67:52 - 67:55)
you're gonna reward me with an Easter (67:54 - 67:56)
egg which you're not (67:55 - 67:58)
it's just more annoying than anything (67:56 - 68:01)
man I hate that in games I hate the like (67:58 - 68:05)
yes or no into my hat into my camp move (68:01 - 68:09)
here now you have two choices pokemon of (68:05 - 68:11)
the week we'll all right last week's (68:09 - 68:14)
Pokemon I didn't say it explicitly but (68:11 - 68:18)
it was pokemon number 400 (68:14 - 68:18)
it's a beaver and commonly used for a (68:18 - 68:33)
gems as we were just talking about in (68:30 - 68:36)
the past up through through Gen 5 that (68:33 - 68:40)
you could use this one for for a gems so (68:36 - 68:46)
who'd that Pokemon it's Pasquale what (68:40 - 68:50)
that's a villager his name is his name (68:46 - 68:53)
is Pasquale and he's also a nodder not a (68:50 - 68:58)
beef is there a beaver villager yeah I (68:53 - 69:00)
feel like I googled it there is there's (68:58 - 69:03)
Chip and CJ they do the fishing (69:00 - 69:06)
tournament oh that's right cuz they eat (69:03 - 69:09)
the fish after you catch them what they (69:06 - 69:12)
do know they you still hate me I mean (69:09 - 69:14)
Huestis like it's kind of like the (69:12 - 69:16)
chameleon guy who does the insect (69:14 - 69:18)
tournament and he's like oh yeah I'm (69:16 - 69:20)
gonna take care of your bug and then (69:18 - 69:22)
he's like goop when you walk out of the (69:20 - 69:22)
tent (69:22 - 69:26)
I want CJ for my village so bad I think (69:22 - 69:27)
you just hosts the fishing tournament (69:26 - 69:32)
though I don't care I'm too non-resident (69:27 - 69:35)
sorry I want him to live my leaving (69:32 - 69:38)
these people in suspense Greg Pokemon is (69:35 - 69:39)
Fumero (69:38 - 69:42)
I believe Aaron believe they say be (69:39 - 69:45)
barrel I don't care no all (69:42 - 69:54)
pronunciations are off Cara blast let's (69:45 - 69:56)
let's get the details on this bad boy (69:54 - 70:01)
wait how do you spell it bi bi (69:56 - 70:01)
Ribeiro (70:05 - 70:12)
oh come on ya barrel again they don't (70:07 - 70:15)
understand how any of our fee gnomes (70:12 - 70:17)
work that what I'm thinking of sure (70:15 - 70:21)
regalo anyways and I is an Ian Japanese (70:17 - 70:26)
isn't it okay yeah but it's not Japanese (70:21 - 70:29)
here's your trivia origin the barrel (70:26 - 70:33)
seems to be based on uh beaver there you (70:29 - 70:35)
go see there is why it's is why I'm sure (70:33 - 70:38)
it's B barrel because of the yeah yeah (70:35 - 70:41)
bit barrel maybe a combination of beaver (70:38 - 70:49)
or Bieber German or beaver and barrel it (70:41 - 70:52)
also may refer to bib which is similar (70:49 - 70:55)
to the pattern on B barrels front (70:52 - 70:57)
there's not a lot of trivia here the (70:55 - 71:01)
Pokemon shuffle icon what you expect (70:57 - 71:05)
I'll say the conquest icon of B Barrow (71:01 - 71:10)
looking very epic oh yeah that's a good (71:05 - 71:13)
one the we the conquest good Pokemon (71:10 - 71:16)
game the good it's a I should play that (71:13 - 71:18)
again I shall find it the only bad part (71:16 - 71:20)
about that game is the ending so sloggy (71:18 - 71:24)
yeah and it's on the 3ds only yeah also (71:20 - 71:26)
slug no I think was a DES game wasn't it (71:24 - 71:28)
it was a DF game EDS it was like at (71:26 - 71:30)
literally end of the s likes lifecycle I (71:28 - 71:33)
think better to come out 2012 yeah (71:30 - 71:36)
though really close to the end alright (71:33 - 71:40)
this week's Pokemon when sound type is (71:36 - 71:42)
introduced into the game oh sweet (71:40 - 71:45)
Pokemon will be a clear contender it is (71:42 - 71:47)
noted for producing seven either tones (71:45 - 71:50)
or cries which can result in ultrasonic (71:47 - 71:53)
waves that have the power to knock flows (71:50 - 71:56)
flying it has a suction cup on its head (71:53 - 71:59)
to hang from the eaves of buildings or (71:56 - 72:02)
tree branches but it is also known for (71:59 - 72:05)
flying about in warmer weather it cannot (72:02 - 72:08)
learn fly as a move though its sole (72:05 - 72:11)
ability is levitate the first game says (72:08 - 72:13)
Pokemon appeared in where Ruby and (72:11 - 72:16)
Sapphire and fiddling fittingly enough (72:13 - 72:19)
the last games where this Pokemon was (72:16 - 72:21)
available in gay (72:19 - 72:24)
were Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire (72:21 - 72:26)
knowing this Pokemon and its pre (72:24 - 72:29)
evolution you would think they shared (72:26 - 72:33)
typing with Jirachi the wish Pokemon but (72:29 - 72:36)
they do not they are a mono type and not (72:33 - 72:38)
the type you would expect from their (72:36 - 72:39)
appearance (72:38 - 72:42)
this week's Pokemon can be found in (72:39 - 72:45)
stage 100 of Pokemon shuffle within the (72:42 - 72:48)
SIL Burnham use iam segment it is (72:45 - 72:51)
notably the only Pokemon of its type (72:48 - 72:53)
found within this segment of the game in (72:51 - 72:56)
the last games where this Pokemon can be (72:53 - 72:59)
found in the wild there was a 5% chance (72:56 - 73:01)
that it could be found with a cleanse (72:59 - 73:04)
tag this is a held item with no (73:01 - 73:05)
in-battle (73:04 - 73:08)
effect instead if the cleanse tag is (73:05 - 73:11)
held by the your lead Pokemon it reduces (73:08 - 73:13)
your chances of encountering a wild (73:11 - 73:16)
Pokemon there you go that's your Pokemon (73:13 - 73:20)
