[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 429th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj will here i'm launching an investigation into cub foods and their carrot cake i suspect they're including an ingredient in there that is an of an addictive property possibly nicotine i don't i don't know but i can't stop eating their carrot cake and and i've got to get to the root of this greg in the wild in the wild at said cub foods last weekend i saw a person write a check at the cash register what is this 1988 i literally just sat there and rudely stared because i had no idea like i'm like we're on a camera show what why is where did you even get it and like the cash register person that was clearly confused as to what was everybody everybody around was like i have no idea what's going on this is the weirdest thing we've ever seen i'm pretty sure the last time i wrote a check at a grocery store was about 2009-2010 somewhere around there oh yeah that was 10 years ago plus plus covet time which is like a million so [Laughter] i mean you're going to sit there and make that whole transaction longer at least they had a mask on it's little it's little things it's a little it's the little pieces of of generosity that we really like in these days all right we got a loaded show here for you all something happened uh i don't know they announced you know a little a little something called dlc oh the gen 4 remakes are here i mean it wasn't that that's not like it was like wow this came from out of nowhere it was like true gee you finally got around to it they didn't say autumn it would it would be more exciting if they announced pokemon sleep but sure um they did steal your joke greg who stole the joke what joke pokemon pokemon stole greg's joke so mad at them greg was the first person to say pokemon go home and sleep i'm sure that's far from true no i have it documented on the internet documentation yes and then and then they're like oh we're gonna advertise that you can do xyz pokemon go home ha ha where's my sleep buddy yeah i'm suing this is all part of the bigger lawsuit taking them all down and there's a lot of pokemon go news so those are the two things we're gonna focus this episode i think we'll just get the pokemon go news out of the way because it's more uh disappointing i guess [Laughter] start with the good stuff i got yeah let's start with the good stuff here this is awesome the good stuff pokemon go live.com the official pokemon go website september 30th here enjoy a limited time free remote raid pass every monday from october 5th through november 30th now can they only be used that day or can you build them up you can build them read me this read me this press please please uh each remote raid pass will be available for a week you have to check the in-game shop to claim it before it's gone from reminder you can only have fewer than three to claim the remote raid pass what does that mean it means if you have three you cannot claim a fourth one you have to use one and then claim it the most you can hold is five but you can only hold five if you're holding two and you buy a three pack but if you're only buying if you're receiving a free individual one you have to have less than three to grab it it's really silly i think the only reason they're doing this is because remote rate passes are technically discounted at this point and they don't want people to stock up on the discounted price when they decide to change it the non-discounted price i'm assuming i mean you limited at three just let us build them up it's not like it's costing you anything and it is literally safety it measures like i hate the fact that it's oh you get three that's it it's like come on i mean they're just punishing the whales at this point i've seen plenty of very hardcore whales stock up on 200 plus remote raid passes during that christmas bundle where the not remote rate passes regular raid passes or last year's christmas bundle which was one of the best prices joke was on them where no one was using regular red princesses i mean they will eventually yeah they will eventually they don't go bad true they do take up storage though they take up storage controversial storage space okay so free raid passes or what is that seven free ones but you can only carry three so get them in the well if if you're caring that much about remote raid passes and you're not using at least one a week maybe you don't actually care about remote rates like what are you saving them for i wait for my good friend steve to text me and it turns out ninety percent of the time he goes elsewhere no no no no i always text youtube first yeah but you only text us for the garbage raids yeah i don't wanna do houndoom i don't care for hound dude raid it is the new it's mega hound first of all well okay you didn't say that in the text all you said was literally wait the entire transcript of the text message i believe is the word houndoom houndoom that is that is literally what we got texted question mark no right one i did connect the dots and figure out oh you mean the new hound doom raid because you don't like to talk to us normally unless we are giving you something this is all the lawsuit no the one that i have is hound doom and 10 which is yeah i got that one i got that one which i was going to respond no because i was at work i have a job i can't be raided pokemons at all hours of the day and then yesterday han doom and 10 again which i did not see the one the one yesterday was hound to houndoom in 10 minutes [Laughter] it was mega houndoom both times to be fair which is the newest mega pokemon oh i got my houndoom candy i'm outta i don't i don't need anymore honduran i don't care about mega hound doom i just know i just want the pokedex entry okay this is also off pokemon go live we're not getting to the bad news yet look forward to talking about the bad news don't we sure do uh look uh look forward to autumn themed pokemon berries bonuses and deerling coming as the seasons change from friday october 9th through monday october 12th the the bullet points here are whether it's spring or autumn where you are plants are flourishing around the world during this event berries will be twice as effective when you give them as treats to your buddy you will earn twice the amount of candy you normally do when catching pokemon you pinapp berries will also drop more often from photodisc stops and gyms pokemon can sense the season changing you can expect the following pokemon more often the wild oddish vulpix bay leaf hoot sudowoodo yanma pineco dot shroomish plant cloak burme and fungus this list of pokemon makes no sense together they're all fair what do they have to do what does zigzag have to do with seasons changing i think zigzagoon is like the thing that collects the berries in hoenn right like a berry hoarder it's a raccoon they do they they collect trash all the time food i mushrooms grow yanma because it's like spring and growth and like bugs and wildlife and fruits and vegetables and plants pseudowudo is a rock but it would like to be a plant but it's a rock it should know what it is and stay in its lane dreams don't have to be based in reality that's why they are dreams look if you i can give you a multi-hour long lecture about how my dreams are clearly not based in any reality incorrect and yeah see you don't even need these texture you know my life i know i i am i watch a pseudo if you're lucky trainers you may encounter a shiny vulpix originally discovered in kanto that extra line is probably because there's been confusion around alolan vulpix uh autumn themed pokemon will be hatching from 5k eggs deerling the season pokemon will be making its pokemon go debut the turning of seasons changes the colors and the scent of this pokemon's fur keep an eye out for the autumn form of deerling so i had a co-worker we were in like the the work zoom based happy hour on friday afternoon and he's like oh did you hear the news and i was like what news dude his only interaction with pokemon is pokemon go he's like oh they're going to release a new pokemon i was like what pokemon are they going to release and he's like deary dearly dude and i was like deerling he's like oh yeah that's the one i was like oh yes creepy it was new they're finally releasing dreepy 11 years ago exactly i mean which farm is the best form and why is it winter uh winter's pretty good i like a good spring i like the spring deerling blossoms in the antler all right blossoms yeah isn't it like cherry blossoms and it's antlers yeah yeah also off pokemon go live pokemon go integration with pokemon home coming soon trainers plans for pokemon go integration with home was announced back in february and we know you are eagerly awaiting the update for this feature we are excited to announce the integration with home later this year when this inner recreation goes live limited time events will be happening in go featuring particular pokemon you'll be able to activate the mystery box once you send a pokemon to home from go and if you open the mystery box during the celebration you will have a chance at a shiny meltan stay tuned for more information on the celebration and how to send pokemon you've caught from go to home and that's it i believe in the trailer they said before the end of the year so we got yes so the last week of december right yes it's pokemon bank all over again i mean they're gonna put it up as long as they can i have a logistical question here um is this is this going to cause the drama that's going on around it no my life is all drama i know is it possible in the world of pokemon to have a mel medal in pokemon go yeah yeah i have multiple models they're really good for team rocket i thought you had to send it to let's go for it to evolve no you cannot evolve meltan in let's go you have to evolve it before you send it yeah four billion candies yeah you had it backwards okay thank you for that piece of clarification protein what's the special we get for doing this hold on it doesn't say in here hold on pro tip the berry week you get double catch candy use your meltdan box during that week get the double candy on the mel tan then when the home integration comes out you got more mel medals than everyone else because you stocked up because you listen to the show and then you trade those male medals for the mythicals you're missing like the sarah aureus or the maguirnas or the vulcanians but anybody can get a male medal you are um let me tell you about twitch let me tell you how many people don't play go and beg people for mel medals because they don't want to play go to get it mel medal yeah is tradable is what i'm saying yeah now that you put it that way it's like but i know all those people that only play go who have mel metal and don't care i've got a shiny male medal and that i'm not trading that for nothing i think i have a shiny i don't care about it so there is something on the japanese website that people freaked out about and then it was later changed um but it seems like there is i'll i'll just say what it is now because what it was doesn't matter anymore what it is now is that there is uh an faq on the japanese website about pokemon go to home saying that there is a cooldown on sending pokemon from go to home and that there will be coins to alleviate the cooldown and that's pretty much all we know we don't know what the q the cooldown is we don't know how many pokemon you can send quote unquote for free we don't know if any of this has to do with the premium subscription for pokemon home which i think all three of us have yep and we don't know what the coin cost is i did a pretty artificial slash lame poll in my twitch chat uh the day that this was announcing you know just what people were comfortable with and almost everyone said that if it was five pokemon a day for free that you can transfer they would be completely happy with that and you know i don't know what the just guessing you know pay a hundred coins for another five otherwise you have to wait 24 hours or you you know this is not new to any anything mobile at this point of paying coins to get rid of the countdown we all knew it was going to cost money right they charge you for storage and they want you to increase your storage in the game so the fact that there was going to be a coin cost shouldn't have been a surprise because why would they give up their cash cow of running out of space for whale collectors and not charge you money to move them i'm surprised there's any hint that there's going to be x amount that are free i definitely can't imagine they don't give a minimum one a day for free which i think is kind of lousy yeah i mean they probably give maybe one one a day for free but i mean one of their big money makers is increasing storage like that is one of the things they charge for there's a cap for that though eventually like what you're at what 4 000 yeah yeah yeah but like out of four years and they increase it what maybe a thousand not a thousand a year what is it like maybe on average 700 a year because we're four years it's caps at like three i don't even know how much you start with storage wise what 400 yeah something like that i think they make way more money off incubators and way more money off raid passes than they do storage because there's there's no ceiling on that i mean probably but also i mean that is one of their things like every community day i'm like do i dump a bunch of stuff or do i buy some storage today and sometimes i buy storage and sometimes i bunch up i bet most of the times you buy storage because i'm in the same exact situation most of the time you buy storage is because you don't want to put the time into looking through your old pokemon to figure out which ones to delete correct so it is it is it is every way they seem to make money is purely off time in your time like i don't want to wait for this i don't want i don't want to do this today right so i will rather pay the two dollars so i don't have to spend 10 minutes to look through my old pokemon but i mean we know that i mean i there are a bunch of people that were shocked that it was gonna cost that there was going to be a cost to it and i don't know what company they think they're dealing with yeah and i i made this point and not a lot of people like the point but you know if you wanted jirachi back on back in the day you remember this greg i still have that disc you you there's one way to get jarachi for six years i looked it up from the coliseum bonus disc to the first distribution in the u.s to everyone else the only way for six years was the coliseum bonus disc so not only did you have to buy a 60 sorry 50 spin-off game coliseum whether or not you like that that's not the point then you had to buy a 20 specific adapter it wasn't the link cable it was the gamecube to game boy advance adapter just to get one pokemon into your copy of ruby and sapphire yep you could get more but that was the only way to get jarachi for six years so i i i guess the argument is and then people are like well that was only a one cost fee yeah one cost fee for one pokemon the point i'm making is this is this this is this company has been nickel and diming people yeah for 20 plus years and i feel like with go people are like finally seeing that but it's always been there because it's more frequent now but it's way more frequent now yeah like you could find so i mean if you had a bunch of friends like let's admit it when you were a kid if one friend had that bonus disc and one family made that investment you could give that doubt to all your friends you were the hero right you were the one getting you were the one getting the bribes you were the one getting to borrow the good video games from your friends yeah you were the hero there are no heroes in this one there are no heroes in moving your own stuff to home until you get your shiny mail medal that you're going to trade for their aura or whatever you want the other question though is how much are people dumping you could be like well i have you know 300 chinese and i'm i'm close to a free-to-play player so i don't have that much storage so yeah i want to dump the shinies i'm dumping the minute i can i am dumping all my shinies out of go like they are just sitting in there yeah doing absolutely nothing but you want to you want to hear a funny story that's that that i don't know it's funny to me the last time greg and i were together in person in the same place collecting porygons i i ran out of storage in pokemon go i got a little alert on my screen cannot capture any more pokemon you're out of space and i was like greg let's go sit on a bench for a few minutes so i can clean out my pokemon storage and make some room for some more porygons fine that's you know a natural reaction to the situation and the way that i clean out my storage is like i feel like i only need one of every pokemon so if i've got 200 patrat you know i keep one and 199 go goodbye but here's the thing as i'm sitting there clearing out my pokemon storage greg is staring out into space enjoying the day he could have taken that opportunity to clear out his own storage i had already cleared out my own storage before we had arrived sure and i had purchased extra storage you were at brunch with me before we had arrived i'm talking about earlier in the day i have a life in this house i was prepared i think that there will be a 1 to ten me speculating i think it would be one to ten pokemon that you can move for free i think one is very stingy i think ten is actually pretty awesome and i think five is is is a good number you're saying per day right per day so you transfer you transfer your five shiny porygon to home and then there's a cool down and you gotta pay if you if you're impatient and you pay a hundred coins it alleviates the cooldown i don't know if it's 100 coins i'm just guessing i think though they need to still make anything that touches home they still have to make that worth it to premium players why am i premium if i'm not getting special treatment well you're getting five million boxes at home that's your special treatment so what do you want greedy if the pokemon company was smart i would argue that for the most part i would say yes because opinions vary because they continue to make money off of all of us if the pokemon company was smart they want to keep adding hooks every way they can to convince a user to get premium because that is 16 a year probably for the rest of our lives unless at some point we just go you know what i don't care about pokemon anymore i'm walking away from the entire series no once you have thousands of pokemon in home you're paying for those memories to be alive because you can't move them anywhere else i mean i guess you could dump the ones you care about into sword and shield and then hope your switch doesn't break because there's no backup solution for sword and shield but it's just like the netflix thing or the google photos thing or the hulu thing of how do we make it so you continue paying and or forget that you have a subscription here i just can't see them not giving any benefit to a premium person i mean i guess they could not and just i mean i would imagine that a premium person would probably get the same as uh an upgrade cost so you could move 50 for free a day yeah the the other thing too is they could be like hey it's gonna be one a day and then in like six months they're gonna be like hey it's three a day and then in a year it's gonna be like hey it's five a day because then a year is like just dump it yeah because that's what ultimately happens right if they allowed everyone to dump all their pokemon okay on december 31st when it goes live everyone dumps their pokemon okay no one uses this now for the next year so if they're preventing a server overload with this i can see an opposite issue if if they give a bonus to the pokemon home premium people all of the pokemon home premium people that don't play pokemon go and don't have anything to transfer are going to say what do i get out of this there should there probably be a distribution right what was the thing before if you transferred from bank to home and you were premium you got like a rotom and an eevee and uh yeah but what if i just don't play pokemon go i mean we know what the the thing is you're going to be able to gigantomax your mill metal yeah but like i don't i don't play go so i mean i do play go but i'm like the hypothetical like i only ever played the video games never played go i i pay for premium because i love all my pokemons i want to keep them forever now you're giving a special bonus to pokemon go players but they already did that what do i get i pay the same amount yeah i don't know if that matters that much because like uh if the only way to get melt and mail metal unless you were to trade was to play go and then transfer it into let's go and then let's go into home and i don't think let's go i don't think let's go convinced any non-pokemon players to play pokemon go i mean i i feel like a lot of the non-pokemon go players i talk to they just don't have a phone that's good enough and they don't care about having a phone that's good enough hmm i don't think i i don't think i've ever ran into like a a pokemon fan with like an iphone 10 being like i'm i'm sure i'm sure that person exists but i feel like every non-pokemon go player is like oh i just have a budget phone and i don't really care about upgrading my phone true all right rough math it would it costs a hundred and six dollars roughly to go from your starting 300 storage to the 3000 max 106 yep yikes so i mean that's not nothing no it's not but a hundred dollars out of four years whereas like i'm sure the whales a hundred dollars out of four years for just one part of the game i would say it's a pretty important part of the game though but when most aaa games are still in the 60 range that is a good deal that's like a lot of that's like a good deal for them they are getting more than a triple a game for for a game that has many other reasons to spend money in it how many people do you think actually maximize their storage though people who paid for premium for home a lot of them i would love we should do it we should do some sort of poll i would love to see how many people i would i would bet a lot of people have probably upgraded their storage but not to the max i mean i haven't upgraded to the max but i have definitely upgraded my storage yeah so i mean if you're talking about giving a benefit the 1699 versus the 106 that they charge to max out your storage there's going to be a balance there somewhere my prop my problem is this though i have 5 000 pokemon in home and i have three thousand pokemon in go and i used to be the person that was like oh i want one of every pokemon in go but i but i have one of every pokemon at home so why do i need two of every pokemon you don't at that point like my only thought process is one i i need to clean up my pokemon home before this happens because i'm very limited and why i don't need one non-shiny weedle in home and one non-shiny weedle in go what am i gonna do with that non-shiny wheel am i gonna meet somebody that's gonna be like i don't have a weedle and i'm gonna be like well it's your lucky day buddy i got one do you want a tray i got one so if they won if anything i dump so i have i have close to 800 shinies so i probably dump 600 of them into into home and then i have how many legendaries because i refuse to throw away a legendary i have 400 legendaries so that's a thousand pokemon between chinese and wait you have 400 legendaries in pokemon go yeah i've never thrown them away do it with your life no this is 12 minutes [Applause] what let's imagine that each one of those legendaries costed a dollar oh gosh i that's a lot of money okay here's what am i gonna do with nothing when niantic reaches the end days we are not trading these things to get food they are just for us and our memories and your emotional attachment mister i would pay any money to get my wedding photos back that's all right thousands of people would though i know but okay here's the thing though we also have like if you're gonna do your poll like how many people just play pokemon go and nothing else like is home is a premium for home a 16.99 enough of to get what is it three thousand more stories six thousand six thousand more storage i mean that's a way better price than trying to upgrade all of go yeah but you're not upgrading there's a difference between upgrading your storage and go and upgrading your storage at home because in go you still see and access those pokemon in home it's a one-way trip they don't come back yeah but what are they going to do with them i've been asking myself that question for four years what am i doing with all these pokemon do we have confirmation that you're not going to be able to transfer things from home back to go yes yeah they've confirmed that oh yeah but i mean so they have a living dex like they have one of everything normal so the the other they just have is why would not move it over you cannot train this is the other thing you cannot transfer a pokemon from go to home unless it's already registered at home so you just can't dump these pokemon you need what does that mean translate that into okay so i have i have 52 deoxys sitting gosh 52 deoxys sitting in my pokemon home right i did 52 raids to get a shiny i got the shiny 52 400 this is why i have 400 and i cannot transfer any of those deoxys unless in my pokemon home i have registered adeoxis already yeah from another game from another non-go game so oh my god yeah it's wild because that's probably what they don't want they don't want look they've always been really weird this is not niantic right we are all in agreement that this is the pokemon company this is the same company that was like you want to move pokemon from gen 4 to gen 5 shoot some bow and arrows into a bush and get those pokemon over like they're the weirdest company when it comes to transferring your pokemon i don't i mean the legendary thing makes a lot more sense with crown tundra right because every legendary is gonna be in there so in that way not being able to transform over until you have it is a a weird encouragement to buy this dlc and play this other game because all of the legendaries are going to be in there all of them so there will be no problem moving them into home at that point yeah and you're probably not going to be able to uh move over like mew or victini or celebi because you only get one right but like genesect darkrai zapdos mewtwo like those should be fine i don't think any of the costumes are coming over i don't think armor mewtwo or uh milady shanks is gonna come over oh i think they will why wouldn't they they specifically say that you know not all i think they specifically say some costume pokemon will not move over yeah flower garland ones i mean that's sort of a weird limit since it can't go into any other game like why wouldn't you just put it in home because i feel like at this point i'm valuing my vap putting more value in my 6 000 home storage than i have my 3 000 pokemon co storage yeah i mean like once once i can start dumping pokemon whether that's five a day or ten a day or one a day um i think it's just gonna lead to me deleting just more pokemon that i wouldn't have normally deleted in go like why am i holding on to all these unknown like i mean i'm holding on to them because everyone smile i need to trade them and it's a good thing to trade but yeah but why am i why am i holding on to like four nine tails unless like the nine tails is lucky or unless that nine tails is like good for taking out gyms it's really easy to get nine tails in literally any main series pokemon game but yeah i wanted the thing where i wanted the thing where i wanted one of every pokemon in in go at that point i'm just eating my own storage and i'm not doing anything with them and i probably don't plan on trading them there are some pokemon i hold on to to trade like i don't know of course a lot i guess that's like completing your there are still benefits and more probably still be benefits in completing your pokedexes in go like they've done that before so there was a reason to be able to complete that but i mean holding them after that like you there's never been a requirement to hold on to them right i mean the other thing i would do too is like uh i have um like one shiny uh what's a shiny that i have that like i have one shiny coughing for example in pokemon i'm not going to trade it it's my only one i'm not going to use it for battles because it's garbage stats what am i going to do with it so my thought process is well i don't have the shiny decks entry for wheezing in go so if i don't have the dex entry and i don't plan on trading it and i don't plan on using it in battles why don't i just evolve it get the dex entry and then transfer it into home because otherwise if i just transfer it i still don't have a shiny wheezing registered so now i gotta find another shiny coughing same thought process probably gonna be bad for raids bad for gyms and then before anyone says well you can put shinies in gyms and flex we still caring about that after four years we never cared about that at the beginning so the only gyms at this point that impressed me are gyms that follow some sort of theme like oh cool all these pokemon are blue or like oh cool all these pokemon are fish oh cool all these pokemon are blue and our fish good to see you basculin i think this whole thing is just wrapped up in disappointment left right center there's like no way you can look at it without being disappointed i mean i'm excited to free up space i mean i'm blessed that i can't dump all my sunglasses squirtles but but we also live in a world where it's like we we we were going to buy premium anyways right we're gonna we're gonna buy in we've already bought in we've bought in with our souls greg i know steve obviously 400 legendaries i mean each and every one of those is like a raid yeah yeah or a special research completion to be fair that's only like 100 legendaries a year to be fair that's a hundred dollars a year that could have gone to charity yeah or our salaries this is so going into velocity hey if you guys are if you guys are missing zapdos i got plenty of trees and i've even got shiny zapdos and i have shiny zapdos can i just doing a heatran no i have all the hatred that i have a very special memories that you clearly don't care about because you're just like lumping him into it i know then he keeps forgetting that special day that we spent together what about latias can i unless they're unless they're kissing i don't care i got one more bit of good news wait what yeah did you have anything else well you sounded like you were still ranting i'm i'm i'm done all right now we get to the bad news the go to home stuff wasn't the bad news that was the spoiler trainers over the past few months we've been making temporary changes to go adapting to the changing global environment that means the pandemic some of these changes will remain implemented for this foreseeable future such as the ability to re remote rately changes to go battling the increased distance that you can spin at stops and gyms we thank you for your feedback the following temporary bonus will remain to improve go you can hold 20 items in your 20 gifts in your bag it used to be 10 if you forgot you will continue to receive three times the stardust and xp for the first pokemon catch of the day i didn't know that was a bonus i just thought that was part of the deal but okay incense duration will remain at 60 minutes used to be 30. when possible people are generally encouraged to spend time outside go on walks and exercise for their mental and physical health all why social distancing and abiding the health and safety recommendations starting thursday october 1st the following bonuses will be modified hatch distance will return to normal for eggs the increased effectiveness of incense will now apply only while walking your buddy pokemon will now your buddy pokemon will now bring gifts when you nearly run out this will happen only once a day i feel like this never worked for me but maybe because i always had full gifts you will still have a higher chance of getting gifts when you spend a pokestop however you won't be guaranteed a gift incubators will be included in more boxes in the in-game shop for a summary of active bonuses keep your eyes on special additionally we are monitoring the global situation and we will work hard to reschedule previous planned live events for 2021. health and safety are important be aware of your surroundings so we don't have to spend we don't have to focus on how the pandemic is still here i don't think a lot of people want to hear that and but and still upswinging it has gone up recently the timing on this pretty not great pretty bad i think pretty dumb i think the big thing people were upset about was the in the incense itself i think if niantic came out and they said everything but the incense i actually don't think people would have cared no because eggs are still garbage if if you're buying eggs you're a sucker or not eggs you're buying incubators yes there hasn't really been anything good in eggs recently i guess they put the bow smooch them in eggs but there's like a there's like a spin three poke stop that will get you both moonshine so you can get smooch them without needing to hatch maybe i don't know maybe the people buying incubators just really like the bass i'm not sure but i don't like feet bass so i don't need to spend money to see feedback more often in my day but i think the i think the incense was the big thing people were upset about and i think the timing on this was very poor although knowing the pokemon company and niantic they probably planned this a month or two ago yep true which sort of you know and things weren't awful well things are yeah things have been bad but they weren't they weren't as bad as they are now yeah but if you're gonna say that you're continuously monitoring the ever evolving global event and every outlet and everything is saying there is going to be a fall uptick and that winter is going to be awful because it's all back to enclosed spaces then you then you would have known that going into this here's the thing that's frustrating about the incest incense thing not only is it only affecting like only while walking but people who have difficulty walking or difficulty moving or anybody who had who where that is a barrier we're getting a huge benefit out of this game that is now gone for no really good reason like that well money i mean money for that but you still were buying money for incense so the increased effectiveness of incense while walking hits on multiple bad levels not just like hey get out and walk but for people who can't do that this momentary wonderful thing is now just taken away from them again for not a great reason other than money it's kind of a really bad decision so i think if the pokemon company slash niantic would have expanded on this i think people would have been less mad prior to the bonuses what would happen with an incense is if you were not moving and it lasted 30 minutes you would get one pokemon spawn every five minutes that is what was never never been confirmed by the pokemon company never been confirmed by niantic but it doesn't take a a data programmer to sit in a spot turn on an incense and then count okay five minutes i get a spawn five minutes i get a spawn now when you were moving with an incense it changed from five minutes to i think three minutes if i remember correctly it's been so long so if you were moving it was still terrible every three minutes you get 10 and not 10 and 30 minutes otherwise you get 6 and 30 minutes or something like that when they changed it to an hour you would get one spawn every 60 seconds if i remember correctly people have tested this new incense as of october 1st and this is this is the big communication flaw here this is what it says on niantic's official website the increased infectedness of incense will now only apply while walking that's not true though so what we know now is if you are sitting still in your house not moving the new incense is every 90 seconds significantly better than the five minutes what it was before not as good as the 60 seconds so if niantic just said this people wouldn't be that upset because it's not that bad it's not that bad it's it's not that good it's not great the timing the timing not so much the timing of it but also the accessibility of it like just just understand like like this one thing helped a lot of people and changing it back is just there's no great reason to have done that even if even if you came out and said hey we're dropping it to 90 seconds you're still saying to people if you are unable to go outside and walk we are heading into winter or you're unable to go outside and walk for many many reasons you you don't get any benefit from you don't get the extra benefit from this it is a weirdly ableist stance and it's coming at an incredibly weird time and it's definitely something they did not need to do they really could have left it i mean i think it would have almost been better to say incense duration drops back to 30 minutes but effectiveness is still there like that would have probably been i would have like i like the 60 minutes way more than 30. yeah but 60 minutes 30 minutes affects everybody equally this one doesn't and that's a problem like i would i would take 60 minutes 90 second spawns over 30 minutes one minute spawns and the reason i would say that is because i thought that one minute was very fast and i couldn't multitask like i just felt like if i if i left the app for a little bit to check twitter or to respond to a text i was missing a spawn and then i felt like i was wasting my 80 cents oh your 80 cents was wasted but so don't don't worry about how you feel about that because i did i did a lot of um at home streams with that's a very perceived problem that's that is your perception because you are multitasking yeah yeah that is your experience because you want to do other things so you want the cushion of 30 minutes that doesn't affect how other people interact with this game or make that better this this having to get a better spawn rate while walking does affect people very unequally whether you perceive it or not the reality is if you cannot walk you are going to be punished well yeah if you're a mobility impaired yes are we if you can't walk you can't go outside you can't do something you're still trying to be safe in a global pandemic that's an uptick all of these things are punishing those people in a way that it doesn't punish equally i mean that's that's a fundamental problem with the game from the beginning right oh yeah yeah that's that's not new i mean it's not new but they didn't have to make it worse is all i'm saying yeah it's like it's like yeah they instead of saying hey by making this change we actually had a greater benefit than we had expected let's keep this change they're saying we're just gonna ignore that greater benefit because you know shareholders i don't think it's that bad though i don't think from 60 seconds to 90 seconds is the end of the world i think it's not the i think they just should have communicated that it's not the end of the world to you i i i don't i do not think that change alone ruins the game you are getting maybe maybe i can't do the math real quick you're getting what five less pokemon an hour but you're still getting 30 plus pokemon in an hour as opposed to the six pokemon you would have gotten on the incense that we had for three years and that was it and if you were moving you would only got 10. so what they're saying now is if you're not moving you would have gotten like 40 and now if you are not moving you get like 36. the past being bad and then being fixed and it isn't a great example to say hey it was really bad before and they fixed it so now it's less bad isn't a great argument but to say like oh we're getting four less pokemon this is awful is like that's that's really like i i don't know i'm not a pokemon accountant [Laughter] i'm i'm not i'm not looking like i would assume that most people listening to the show didn't just assumed it went back to normal once every five minutes but it went from 60 seconds to 90 seconds which was not communicated which was why people were upset they thought that like oh now what's the point of even using incense these two companies are so bad at communicating things if they would have just said hey that right instead of instead of every six um you know 60 seconds we're changing it to every 90 seconds i think most people would be like yeah uh okay fine and if you're moving you're going to get more pokemon which i don't know i wish i did i don't know with the old incense i don't think it mattered if you were moving or not because i did i think you were just getting one every minute i don't think you could make one i don't well if you could make them spawn in like 45 seconds i don't think you could unless you were fast catching i don't think you could catch non-stop but the timing on this is bad i'm not saying the timing is bad the communication is bad the decision is a little questionable i i think if this if this was if this was not both of these so hatch egg distance will return to normal like i don't find the only people complaining would probably be the people who buy 10 incubators a week and put their phone in a sock and spin their sock in a circle to hatch i thought you had a spring i didn't do it in a pringles tube i thought that was the best way but you go a hatch distance returns to normal oh guess well guess what's this week an egg event huh the timing of that and then you go the increased effectiveness will only apply to walking okay well everyone's mad because you didn't actually say what you're doing and if you would have said what you were doing people probably would have been like okay i gotta wait an extra 30 seconds that's not the end of the world it still lasts an hour but they probably could have just waited till july january 1st they should have waited until january first because even though we all know deep down the pandemic isn't going anywhere january 1st everyone has this like thought process of new year a new year niantic really just they need more people on these decisions and how to communicate like they just they just need to sit down and be like okay let's let's think about how we message this because they are so weirdly secretive about the dumbest things and it just serves to make people mad ingress had the same rollout actually i wasn't sure if this was like the pokemon company forcing niantic's hand here ingress has the same role that roll out on things ironically harry potter wizards unite still has all their safety features they did not roll back any of them so it seems that warner brothers said no the only reason i bring that up is because people are very quick to blame niantic but why didn't the pokemon company step in if they also didn't care if warner brothers cared niantic listened where's the pokemon company say let's not roll some of these out right now i don't know it's frustrating i mean yeah pokemon company also is very japan focused and their experience is vastly different take a break and then we'll talk about crown tundra i don't hate zelda self [Music] there's probably a horse at some point hello hello hello it

we are back this was sent in by brandon from our slack off pokemon brandon brandon is always raising controversy i [Laughter] we need an investigation of that dude right there compete in the battle of legends online competition this is a tournament competition allows trainers to have one legendary pokemon or one mythical pokemon on their team you can battle against pokemon like mewtwo lunala zashian uh if you participate in at least one battle you will get 50 battle points it will take place thursday october 15th until sunday october 18th um the pokemon you are allowed to use are mewtwo mew celebi jirachi reshram zekram are all allowed do i get a t-shirt no just battle points i'm out i think i'm sitting this one out i'm out no well i was getting my ass t-shirt nothing for me i was going to ask uh mr pokemon continuity were there any issues with legendary versus mythical of on who was allowed in this particular competition you got them ultra piece no the only the only mythicals allowed are the mythicals that have been allowed in sword and shield yeah but it's the legendary battle tournament battle of the legends yes not battle of the myths i don't know why you would do a legendary when mythicals normally have better base stats better movement no i mean everybody's gonna use mu he's cute i think mel is the male battle not the choice here like what fire legend are you gonna go up against uh resharam restaurant yeah victini is victory victini is not allowed [Music] yeah i guess restaurant maybe mew with flamethrower i guess mewtwo with flamethrower i think male metal is probably the safe bet though a marshadow is fighting take your steel true that's true there's a whole bunch of counters look at you and i didn't even i didn't even have a coach and i know how to defeat your team already well now you've got to enter the competition greg no there's no t-shirt i'm holding out is also off pokemon.com there's a new raid rotation wild area update october 1st from set this goes until saturday october 31st you can find ghost type pokemon like gengar drift blum dusk noir and dark type pokemon like high dragon grim snarl more pico they will appear more frequently in max raid battles if you're missing giganta max gengar or gigantomax grim snarl here's your chance they're pretty easy to find yeah i have a particular issue in that now when i play pokemon every day and i get the little badges on the left-hand side of my screen of like here's what's going on in the world i don't recognize the silhouettes of the dinos of the raids i'm like what is that pokemon and i'm like i'm pretty sure i've seen them all but i wow there are some ones out there that i'm like i don't recognize that silhouette in the slightest bit it's a jigglypuff you gotta up your pokemon game i'm not upping my pokemon anything until i get that shiny snomed so whatever positive vibes people can send me from the universe thank you all right and then that will be my last day on snapchat i'll be freed this is off uh the the press release email the pokemon company sent on over for the trailer here this is september 29th today the pokemon company and nintendo has announced the crown tundra the second set of downloadable content for the blockbuster pokemon sword and this this is their exact words pokemon star and pokemon shield video games will launch on october 22nd so technically 22nd for the us 23rd for japan uk everyone in the future i'm assuming it's uh everyone's getting at the same time just like mm-hmm isle of armor so it seems like that but i love armor what when did we actually get when did it drop the u.s got isle of armor isle of armor at like what 11 a.m remember they did the they did the direct and then they dropped it after the direct because we woke up early we got the trailer then they said come back next week for something else and then the next week was pokemon unite so it was very weird because we got out on wednesday was pokemon unite really that long ago yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're gonna get it thursday night japan uk europe australia they're getting it friday morning crown tundra trainers can explore a vast frigid landscape unova confirmed with jagged snowy mountains and drifts of glittering snow and the expansion pass is available for the eshop trainers will have the opportu and starting on november 6 trainers will have the opportunity to purchase bundle packs consisting of the pokemon sword and shield base games as well as the corresponding expansion pass which includes both the isle of armor and the crown tundra these bundles are well suited for trainers who have yet to embark on their journey this was kind of obvious we've talked about this for months that there's no way they're not putting out an updated version on shelves before the holiday yep yeah true yeah absolutely that was a given i'd be curious if like target walmart pulls the old copies at this point i don't know i mean they probably have both because i mean i don't i don't know is it a different price like is it oh yeah they did not show they didn't they didn't show price so we don't know like i'm assuming it won't be 60 bucks i mean ideally it would be 90 but if they're putting it on shelves at 90 that seems really high so usually i don't know i could see them pricing it at 80 but that still seems a lot i mean if they put it at 60 that that that'd be a heck of a steal for people who have not played yet that would probably move a lot more than during the video presentation ishihara president and ceo of the pokemon company also unveiled a newly discovered pokemon new games and exciting in-game bonuses for sword and shield uh or the expansion pack as well as the updates to go we already talked about that so the newly discovered pokemon there's two of them one is galerion slow king uh which is the poison psychic type pokemon with the ability curious medicine a shelter bite set off a reaction between chemicals uh by galore glaring slow king's brain and the species in spices inside its body causing slow poke to gain poison type when evolved into slu gallerian sloking sloking has been observed uh uttering incarnations in order to communicate with others and appears to change incantations indentations and appears to chant mysterious spells while mu while using moves in battle valerian slow king's ability curious medicine is a new ability introduced in the crown tundra the other new pokemon is gigantomax mel metal while gigantomax the mythical pokemon mel metal can use its flexible elastic liquid metal body to land punches even when the opponent keeps their distance steel type attacks used by gigantomax male metal will change into g max melton a powerful move that slams the opponent with shock waves and swirling liquid metal this move not only deals damage to opponent it prevents them from using the same moves consecutively that actually seems like a pretty good gmax move yeah especially if somebody's using like a focus sash so what is that one called torment is the torment that stops you from being able to yeah torment i think yeah so it's it's torment and well torment that does damage torment on a stick curious medicine the ability for slow king it removes um it normalizes your stat changes so if you were like negative to attack because of intimidate when galerian slow king comes out it will change that back to normal only affects you and your partner does not affect your opponents but i mean if you but it also affected if you had built it up right like it resets yeah it resets everything yeah so it resets an ally stat changes so if you got a defiant boost or whatever it go away from my understanding yeah [Music] i think hilarion slow king is not going to be good and competitive but who am i somebody time date stamp that well it's okay so it's signature move i don't remember what it's called yeah eerie spell it it removes the pp minus three depending on the last pokemon like depending on the pokemon's last move so for example if you were fighting a premarina that's going to hydro pump and they pped up their hydro pump they would have eight so it would bring it down to they use the hydro pump they're down to seven you use mysterious spell eerie spell eerie spell and then it brings it down to math time four so they can still use hydro pump again but one that's assuming you survive two that's assuming that they planned on using the move you planned on removing the pp and three what if you just knocked them out instead of worrying about how much pp they had i mean but this also works on things like sucker punch right yeah yeah yeah i mean it would work on any move and i think it depends on on how beefy slow king clarence hulking actually is right yeah if it's if it's a defensive tank because slow king already has regular looking has pretty good defenses doesn't it i don't know the status distribution between a slow king and a slow bro but slow bro isn't that beefy i know that for sure uh slow king's base stats uh defense is bad but special defense is 110. that's good that's a good number pretty good so i mean it it depends on what they are going to do with it but i could see that being a a way of getting rid of some of those moves or like if somebody sets up trick room right does trickroom doesn't have a lot of room is eight as well yeah i mean you're eating away at those i don't think i've ever i've groomed more than twice though which is yeah i've never seen a competition that's been won by eating up somebody's pp it's just no i think the other that doesn't happen until now the other thing too is like i believe eerie spell is a psychic type move yeah but if if if indeed he's coming back or uh tapu lele is coming because they're lifting the band on the 16 pokemon when series seven starts you're you have easy ways to set up psychic terrain and i doubt that eerie spell is going to do 110 damage and why would you just not use expanding force expanding force hits both pokemon it does 110 damage it gets the 20 boost in psychic terrain so again who cares how much pp they have if they're dead yep slow bro has those stats the defense and special defense swapped so slow bro's defense is 110 oh okay that says 80. so they're swapped between slow bones looking good to know so the question is is that is that similar swap going to happen in sulking so if they swapped attack and special attack what is glieran's what is glare and sloking stats i mean bros stats do we know um slo-bro has a high special attack i know that for sure because i used one so is it possible that they would swap them that way king has a physical attack well okay glaring slow bro attack is 100 and special attack it's 100 so yeah i wanted to say they they're normally mixed attackers curious gallerian slow bro is it's the same stats as cantonian slo-bro so i'd be curious what they're gonna do i i have a real question about glarion slow king which is pretty much occupied my mind since the moment i saw its actual it's its image does it see through the the shelter's eyes the shelter is in control clearly are you sure i'm just yeah the shelter is in control you can see the the uh slowpoke eyes are are in there you can see them under the crown thing so i was um i don't know this is a luke skywalker on the million falcon thing it's trusting it's trusting his partner to be its eyes it also pours goop out of its shell holes so does it really i didn't notice here i'm sending you the link where the picture is in dynamics adventures players will team up with three other trainers and explore pokemon den or dynamaxx pokemon are said to lurk instead of the regular pokemon team players and their fellow trainers can choose pokemon that they will temporarily use for battle rental pokemon they must have been listening to the go fans and how much they love to run players will have to work together with their three teammates in a max raid battle whenever they encounter a wild dynamax during their exploration if they win the battle players will then have the opportunity to catch the pokemon and one of the trainers can swap their newly caught pokemon for the pokemon they've had before trainers will dwelve deeper in the den with endless dynamaxx adventures which enables players to play until they lose a battle okay so this is one of the big features here this is the uh team up with three people go into a den at the end there's supposed to be a legendary pokemon yep still a lot of questions not answered here number one do you only get to catch one legendary pokemon number two does everyone get to catch the legendary pokemon or is it just the host number three i think the rental thing is actually fine because it prevents people from just doing like greg brings eternius i bring eternity will brings eternities and the last person brings mewtwo wait explain the rental thing to me again um so when you go into it you will get presented i think with four different pokemon yep and you'll see all their moves you'll see their held items and then you pick and everyone picks a rental and then when you battle the first dynamax pokemon then one of the four people participating can take the one they just caught and then swap it out with the rental yeah well swap it for the rental that they started with so i cannot bring my own pokemon no no you may not this sounds like the pokemon mystery dungeon people [Laughter] snuck in at night like let's not kid ourselves when it comes to current dynamics battles you pick the poke you're like i'm fighting rhyperior i'm going to bring a water pokemon you're not you're just spamming the same move there's no there's not like there's the only maybe exception to that was uh the like the only exceptions are like maybe clefable and like the mewtwo stuff like clefable the only difference is you start off using taunt uh so it doesn't minimize but it's not like what we've had for the last year has been incredibly difficult because hey if it's a rock type pokemon i know what it's weak against true yeah i mean it's interesting that like in the pictures you see that there are paths and like you can go down the path where it looks like you get a doctor you go down the path where it looks like you get berries and like you get to choose which path you want to go to and it does list hey if you go down this path with this doctor you'll be fighting a fairy type so it does seem at least there is some level of strategy what i'm curious is if these dens will show you the legendary that you can get at the end and that's like how you choose to go in but like this branching pathing is pretty great you know better than that what's gonna happen is it's going to be like you don't know it's a mystery what pokemon's gonna be at the end of the day and then like a day later somebody's gonna be like i data mined it and if you're entering the den and there's a gold rock in the upper right hand corner it's going to be one of these four pokemon if there's a silver berry in the lower left-hand corner it's going to be one of these four i'm like oh already already i'm disgusted with things that haven't even happened you are just making things up the data miners just live to they do to remove the joy from playing these games all together do we think that all of the denzen crown tundra will be these exploration dens gosh do you think there'll be some regular ones i thought i saw the um like the little purple light dealies in in the ground yeah they have through the crown tundra what greg is asking are all the dens in the crown tundra this the new dens right so like if i wanted to do old dens i have to go back to isle of arms yeah i would find that hard to believe i i would want the new style dens that let you go deeper as they say to look different yeah i would agree with you because i don't know if i want to do new style dens with computers yeah and but then also it's like if i'm on the isle of armor like if i learn how to go deeper into the dens in the crown tundra why can't i then when i go to the isle of armor do it there why when i go to the wild area why can't i do it there uh their copy and paste broke yep this screenshot of like a trainer standing in the path and the arrow and the berries it looks bad why it just this overview it it just doesn't look good it just looks very it looks artificial it looks fake it looks like a flash game what like the like the trainer like it's a very flat surface right like the background is flat and then the pokemon silhouettes are flat and then the trainer has like slight 3d to it wait are you looking at like the overhead of the map yeah where it says fire fairy bug psychic rock and then there's berries this is the screenshot i'm looking at yeah i'm looking at the same one bad yeah but a lot looked bad before it was actually moving yeah maybe yeah it may be a movement it looks better i mean there could be a whole bunch of things going on here that's in this screenshot that i mean this is just a still screenshot well but also my previous statement again it's just pokemon mystery dungeon and that that game didn't have that great graphics so that's what you're gonna get all hate mail can go to will anderson oh the hate mail is going to come from one person and once i delete snapchat they won't have any way to communicate with me so uh i'm you know i'm i'm excited i hope it's good i i still have all these questions about the legends and yeah and whatnot like i mean i'm i am looking forward to being able to do like four people getting together doing this whole like hey let's rent these pokemon and do this thing like the endless dynamic adventure sounds like a good monday night raid night there is an endless mode where you can just keep going i think this has already existed but in the dojo where you can you can keep going for whatever mustards uh restrictive sparring i think it's called yup i don't know you've been doing it for a week i know but there's no there's no reason there's no reason to why like yeah you can get i mean for bragging rights i guess you could be like i went to 15 and then you know what what's gonna happen this is what's gonna happen it's like you go to five for so if you don't know what restrictive sparring in in the isle of armor what it does is you pick you pick which type you want so let's say you want um water and you have to bring three water pokemon and then you have to do five battles in a row you can heal twice up to two times during these battles and then you ha you have to win five and you have to do that for all 18 types and if you were to do that for all 18 types you get an exclusive shirt which is what the diglett thing should have gave you she gave you a shirt that said i i did the diglett thing that's what the shirt should have said i did the diglett thing so here's the most important question is the shirt worth it to me no i think it's an ugly shirt i just want the shirt to show that i did it and i have the shirt i was here on this date of the concert when they were in milwaukee i just want the shirt to show that i did it so 18 types five battles each what is the math on that that's like 70-some battles right it's a lot of battles and so if in restrictive sparring if you get paralyzed but you still have full health you go into the next match being paralyzed and you only have two revives and the computer can use whatever they want so if they're p if you're doing three water pokemon because that's you're doing the water challenge guess what they're bringing electric they're bringing grass they're bringing things weak to super effective to you so it kind of makes you feel like the gym leader and i would argue that if you're not ev trained and you don't put held items on it's actually pretty hard but there is an endless mode there once you get to five it'll say do you want to keep going and i guess you can say yes and you can maybe go to like 10 or 15 but you know what's gonna happen you're gonna be like hey i got to 15 and restrictive sparring the other night and your friend is gonna go i've never done that what is it because i feel like basically no one has ever talked about restrictive sparring i mean if you're going to break everything down like that i mean bragging only matters to you and the one person that might know what you're talking about like that is all of shiny hunting oh cool yeah i'm just saying for the endless adventure here yeah but the endless adventure here could be going to find more legendaries in a row and having a chance to catch them right like there could definitely be a reason like i'm going to keep going down here and see what the next legendary are and see how many i bet it does i can catch it in a in a set i bet that there are i bet that you get the legend after five and then anything after that is just normal pokemon because in the in the restrictive sparring you get i think it's 30 battle points when you get to five and then everything after that is just like three battle points three battle points three battle points yeah i'm assuming once you get the legend he asks if you want to leave or if you want to keep going but i guess we don't know but also like what do you get if in restrictive sparring if you're getting battle points what is this giving you um pokemon yeah okay i guess pokemon but like is it giving you like armor right or is it giving you uh experience candy do you want to be with these people even longer do you want to suffer with dean noah and isabelle for more battles i thought i wanted to be with you but apparently it's just will and i and whoever else wants to join because you're a party pooper with the crown tundra trainers will be able to encounter every legendary pokemon that has appeared in the main series video game players can find and catch legendary pokemon during their travels uh in the crown tundra or while on dynamaxx adventure and then just keep in mind some legendaries will only appear in pokemon sword others will only appear in pokemon shield what a rip-off it's almost like they've been doing this for 20 years too they're doing distributions for pikachu uh all these hat pikachu that were in sun and moon and then came back in sun and moon um are they're doing it again so if you're missing out on the hat pikachu uh there's a bunch of those okay quick quick quick quick sidebar question in the legendary list it shows urjifu mm-hmm or she feels legit are we assuming there will be hershey food tens so you can get the other k so you can get the other one so like if you want water you can get the dark one that way yes that's what i'm saying this is important for me to decide what i'm doing with my cub food when i do my sword dlc you keep it up yeah they need to yeah i need to keep that kub foo for my living decks yeah just put it just put everest on it i mean i just get it and don't have to do anything right because if i can get a dark one from these legendary dens you can you can go through the whole tower with an everstone and when you get to the end um mustard will say like oh i see you don't want to evolve your cub food you don't have to but you can complete the dlc without evolving it but why would i want to go through the tower so you don't have that marker on your map all the time would be the only reason i think you get one legend right there's no way they're gonna be like there's no way they're gonna be like you get like three hershey food by just running dens i really bet the host is the only one that can catch the legend no no no no no it's everybody in the in the raid just like raids always are yeah maybe i guess i mean if it's not then that that that exclusivity hurts a lot it's no different than any exclusivity i only get one character when i play sapphire i only want one groudon when i play ruby the only time they threw you the only time they threw you a bone was in uh ultrasound ultra moon where there's like here's two blacephalons and here's two stockatakas yeah but like in this current in the current den thing if a sword person threw up a den you could still catch the one from across the way oh without having to do a trade yeah and that would be a huge change for this one what's stopping like what's stopping the host from just resetting themselves the three partners catch and then they just run it again and they're like all right here you go here's unlimited outselfs nothing but they haven't done that so far they haven't put that limit in on anything that's why if yeah that's why if the limit is only the host can catch then there's no point in the host resetting because they're not they're not resetting for the other three and then there's no point in anybody doing raids with you yeah yeah because i cannot get anything from all this hard work one you're getting the pokemon up to it too do you really want to do it with cpus yeah why not uh it doesn't matter about what i want i i could not want to do it with cpus and still have all my friends not want to do it with me because they don't want to waste their time on getting all those uh zygarde you help me get my zygarde do you think that's how the world works you're imagining things i get my zygarde and i'm like sorry guys i gotta go to bed sorry work early tomorrow as somebody who's done a lot of destiny raids there are a lot of those people yes i mean i just think like that's a big departure from how they've set up all raids going so far i can see them really changing the odds but i don't think they'll just say oh only the host gets it i mean they they let us do mewtwo and say hey you can't catch me too yeah but nobody could but nobody can catch it what if this happens what if no one catches it it then forces the pokemon to spawn in a point in the game where you walk up to it and then you can catch it because again because how are you going to software set for it why do you have to software set for it because people are going okay people already hate sword and shield and now they're going to be like oh you can't get shiny legends you can get shiny legends you just can't soft reset for them okay so even if all your friends are all gonna catch the landorus do you think all your friends want to do this one in four thousand times did the designers of this game are making design choices around anyone's ability to maximize their opportunity to get a shiny pokemon yeah they are sorry they have purposely locked pokemon they know that players do this they are definitely making these decisions well no they make decisions to stop people from getting shiny pokemon if they're making decisions for to stop people from getting shiny pokemon then why would they not make the decision of we don't want you to get 200 landorus by just resetting again if the host resets and the other three catch the host does it again and then it's just unlimited landorus well i think we're in a time of unlimited landorus that's a that's a very depressing time i mean they haven't done it for anything else they just haven't we've been dealing with why aren't you getting unlimited gmaxes yeah and they've had a full year to figure this out and they haven't done it this is the update yeah what makes us think they're going to like they haven't even like they have that year they didn't change it with the last stop this is the first time catchable legendaries will be in raids so to say they've never done this yeah i guess but they've never done this for actual legends they gave us two towers for hershey food they gave us one hershey fu they clearly care about limiting what they they clearly over the years have cared about limiting legends yeah then they put earth it's all been an accident it's all been coincidence [Music] you're assuming they're giving you the other urshifu they're giving you you're paying just like they they make things easy over time here are more mints on the ground here is armoritor here is more there they do make things easier over time but let's not let's not pretend that they don't care about limiting your legends so but are you also then saying that you will only ever again get one articudo den spawn ever and once that's done you will never see another articuno yeah once you go through the ultra wormhole and you catch mewtwo there's no more ultra wormholes with mewtwo anymore right it's gone you did it i don't know i didn't do ultra wormholes what's the difference of going through an ultra wormhole and going through a raid den besides that you can do it with people that's the only difference but so what you're saying is it so do you think it'll be a 100 catch rate for the for the person for the for the person that starts the raid if you go through a landorus rate and you throw one pokeball and you don't catch the lander risk do you do the whole thing again like that that's a bad experience if like if i really yes yeah yeah but if okay so this goes back to your guys's original argument if i convince three friends hey i want to do landorus will catches the landorus i don't greg doesn't um uh horcapus doesn't what what what is will's uh agreement to be like oh i already got the landorus why would i want to do it again it took 20 minutes i i want to go ride my bike yeah i do want to go ride my bike you're right like even even if everyone gets to catch it and everyone gets to throw one ball because that's how it's always been for dynamaxx raids if three of your friends catch it and you don't we we know that people are selfish so why do they want to help you do it again i mean there's a ton of people who do want to help you do it they are like your destiny problem but but what i'm asking is do you think that there are how many legendaries are there there are 50 thousands there are only 50 dens that have these in here and once you catch one that den is shut down and you will never see another articuno no you know what that's what i honestly honestly and truly i think what now i'm putting all the pieces together here i've got a big board with pictures and and string and thumb tacks and and all it's all tying together here's the answer i finally cracked it because and and i blame steve you have ruined pokemon okay fair because you have 400 legendaries in pokemon go that you are going to transfer into pokemon home which you could then transfer into sword and shield if you want they're like that's it legendaries are busted everybody get 400 legendaries they're not special anymore steve i ruined it i paid a dollar for every one of those i paid 60 dollars 400 you could have bought a put a good down payment on a ps5 but instead you've ruined pokemon this is what i think did you in auris were there multiple hoops or did when you caught one out of that hoop did it did that hoop disappear yes once you caught azelf in the hoop for auras you could never catch another as of once you caught a tarakian in the ultra wormhole you could not catch another track in i don't see why this would be different no i mean maybe it's that way but maybe when you when if if maybe if it's like the leader of the party is the only one that can catch it then when you go back it says hey you can't be the leader you've already defeated this den if you if it's like every single raid battle where you can only throw one pokeball and you do not catch it i think that is a bad experience for everyone especially because it's not like you're going into landorus directly you are probably having to do five raid battles before that and hopefully that is fun we've done raid battles for the last year we know what rey battles are i don't know if they're going to make them suddenly more fun i would guess that you don't catch the legend at the end because you're you can't guarantee to catch it anyways unless they're giving the host a hundred percent catch rate and then when you defeat landorus for example then landorus will spawn in the overworld where you can walk up to it at any point and then catch it on your own that would prove i like that concept that would prevent people from would would anybody who was in that raid be able to catch it that i i don't know i don't know how that would communicate back to the game because that's a really weird sort of hey help me activate my laboratories yeah well that's better to activate landorus together yeah but that's better than like hey help me do landorus oh cool you caught it i didn't you wanna hate you you want to help me again and it prevents the issue of let's do landorus you got you three catch it i'll reset so mylanderis isn't permanently gone i just can't imagine the the game freak's gonna let you catch like 14 landorus why you already have yeah but they i mean yeah but they made me pay a dollar every time that's the difference nobody made you pay that i mean you chose they made you pay 15 ahead of time i mean the only reason i think that possibly the legends spawn in the wild is because we see articuno flying over the trainer in the trailer um yeah but we didn't know if that's part of the story could be part of the story yeah we don't know what that is like why is articuno look weird now we can't base any of any of uh uh one screenshot off of oh was it a screenshot of this video it was a video but like it was two seconds we also don't know how kaylee rex spawns or if that's gonna be an array then it's just i mean there's a lot of both ways it can go i mean it's a bad experience in a lot of ways if like all these raid dents disappear and like the big selling point on crown tundra is all these legendaries are in raids and that's a limited time thing that is a very limited time thing for you enjoying this dlc unless there's a whole bunch of other stuff that they've added i don't i don't think the rides are gonna be limited i mean catching 50 legendary pokemon there's no way you're going to be able to do that in a day especially if you have to do cut to cut cut to the 23rd and somebody has done it all yeah maybe but if if they are restricted maybe i guarantee you but if you have to do five raid battles before you get to a legend raid battles are not 30 seconds well we don't know that you have to do those five we don't know that that we know that there will be endless dynamics adventures and we know that they'll be that but we don't know that there's always going to be a five ahead of time we have no idea if there's some that are just go straight to the legendary and some that are walk through stuff and then get like we have no idea what that looks like like we don't know what this heart up in the corner of the screenshot means there are four hearts in the corner what does that mean yeah uh oh zelda crossover i think the dynomax adventure is how you get it it says try swapping out your pokemon as you explore uh whenever you seek the legendary pokemon that lurks in the depths and when you delve even deeper endless dynomax may be the thing for you endless dynamics lets you keep going until you lose so specifically in the explore the pokemon dens and dynamaxx adventure it says like how as you seek legendary pokemon i'm not saying every legendary pokemon is gonna be there i'm assuming uh cash register and uh reggie drago are probably going to be more storyline focused as well as articuno zapdos and maltrice more storyline focused and probably calaric's more storyline focused but we see like we see landorus in a max raid we see tapu coco in a max raid we see red red red ice in what looks to be a cave which normally the reggies are always in a cave and then we see the trainer using um a verisian in the snowy field well that's not appropriate because version is grass i i i think 50 unique raids for 50 legendary pokemon is a lot of content i don't doubt that if it's not fun the first time it ain't going to be fun the 50th time i would say that the the hoopa thing was pretty cool although that was on a time limit right like it was only like certain rings spawned on certain days and people would have to reset the clock that was a little annoying i would say the ultra wormhole stuff was fun i thought it was fun i know not everyone loved all the wormhole but you know if i was looking for mewtwo i knew i had to go to the i think mewtwo was like blue or yellow or something so i would keep trying to go for yellows i guess we'll know in like three weeks so yeah yep uh the ability patch is being introduced in crown tundra you get a you can get new eye in the crown tundra you may get new items called ability patches that are hard to come by but worth the effort if you use one on a pokemon the ability will change the species hidden ability if it has one finally with an ability patch and helping a max it doesn't say if you can get rid of the hidden ability here um which is maybe the problem with an ability patch and the helping of max soup on the olive armor you can bring out the hidden ability of your first partner pokemon that you chose at the beginning of sword and shield with the capability of giganta maxing as well so you can get a grassy ger surge your your starting grookie can be grassy surged and gigantomax and minted you can have it all finally now let me change the ball greg you ask too much come on that's not too much and then finally uh there is the gallerian star tournament once you progress far enough in the crown tundra you will be able to participate in the gallerian star tournament held in wyndon this tournament is leon's brainchild intended to fire up the spirits of the gala region once you accept leon's invitation you will be able to pick a partner pokemon among the many trainers you've met throughout sword and shield as well as the expansion pass team up for multi-battle tournament depending on who your partner and who your opponents are you will meet you will see a glimpse of new sides of familiar faces so we have a new area we have cali rex we have it says new regional forms but that's really misleading because it's literally just slow bro slow king sorry pokemon that did the birds no no no the legendary birds the reggie's the reggie's and two reggies those aren't forms those are true new pokemon we have pokemon wait i thought reggie steele and reg ice and they all got new forms two brand new reggies we have pokemon that didn't appear in sword and shield like spheel garchomp the new pokedex so hopefully we get something when we complete that pokedex we have a new clothing item cool new pokemon added makes max raid battles new items uh and then new co-op play mode which is did they ever fix the numbers for the pokedex for isle of armor fix the numbers so when isle of armor first came out if you caught a pokemon that is an isle of armor in the isle of armor expanded pokedex it did not have a pokedex number so you didn't really know where you were in the order of pokemon that were available in isle of armor don't i guess this is something i could find out for myself somebody would know the issue was no no the issue was if you moved a pokemon from home into the isle of armor the isle of armor didn't recognize that you caught it that was the issue that's not my issue my issue is i want to see a number up in the corner this is i've got this one of this many that i'm expected to get so i have an idea of what my target is i guess i don't know what number you're talking about pokedex number yeah it had one it was like it was like uh one out of 206 or something no no no the original that you get the glare and pokedex from one to four hundred when you started catching isle of armor pokemon they did not have a pokedex number mine did they did not start at 401. no no no because that pokedex is done two different pokedexes just like in sun and moon you had the melamele pokedex you had the island when i go when i go in to look at my pokemon in their boxes there's no pokedex number in the little spot where our pokedex number is supposed to appear well not all pokemon have a pokedex number like popplio and rowlet don't have a pokedex number because they're technically not in the pokedex but like sharpedo should have a pokedex number for the isle of armor i think um it does not i see what you're saying and i raised this q i raised this issue to you a long time ago and you're like yeah they that's a bug no the bug was trading a pokemon from home into it did not register properly they did fix that they fixed that well thank goodness for that i think that the same weekend they got rid of shiny zamasunta in raids because people were hacking those in i see what you're saying because it only goes up to 400 so like there's no 401 for like sharpedo yeah yes no that that has never been addressed which aggravates the head you also cannot search for popplio in in the search feature which is incredibly infuriating if you were looking for a popplio to put a pre-marina on your team what you can't wait when you like go to all boxes and you do like type moves ability pokemon if you go to pokemon you can't search for like popular raleigh they don't exist oh so you'd have to like if you wanted to find popplio the fastest way to do it would be like search for like a water fairy pokemon or or go into home and search from there and then no but if i have a bunch of populars in my 32 boxes how do i find it quickly yeah there is no way unless i mark it look there better be new ribbons in this expansion there you go that's the important thing yeah who cares about legendary and you'll get a ribbon every 10 uh eternal that you go through i just want more ribbons on my pokemon is it so much to ask for you'll get it so complete the first 10 endless dynomax adventures you'll get stage one and then if you can get up to 100 you'll get a super ribbon wait so wait now we have mythicals legendaries and eternals greg what is this well the endless dynamics adventure so you can get a ribbon that says you have done the endless the endless endless restrictive sparring should i give a ribbon it doesn't though nope well maybe it does maybe up to 15 you get a ribbon i know you haven't restricted smart enough you don't know keep going oh i know all right we're going to skip question of the week this podcast is way too long rude [Laughter] save them all for next week you just copy you didn't even you didn't even talk about the hats what hats hat pikachu what we did what did they're the same ones from sun and moon copy past that's master copy paste but they're available now with codes three of them are three of them are available as of us recording there i think are seven in total there are people that rely on our news yeah i'm tweeting it i'm instagramming it nobody follows your garbage social media that's not true actually somebody who i know from dc who is completely unrelated to anything in this podcast retweeted one of steve's little infographics and i was like it's coming at me from all angles take it away from this i've got a quick question of the week okay how garbage was that awful music video spent their money on so good some on fixing the trees steve and i will do a special hour-long dissecting everything that's in that video because it is so amazing perfect yeah we'll save that for next week the video is fine we'll save it for when will he's not angry it was good i watched it like 20 times wait till the next decade pokemon of the week pokemon of the week last week's pokemon of the week it was a quiz i'll go through this really quickly since we have been going for a long time i'm going to go through all the questions i will give you the correct answer and then greg you can tell me what the right answer is at the end steve you can say chat okay uh question one which of the following types has been represented by only one starting pokemon evolution fighting steel ground dragon correct answer was b steel question two which is the following and also for everybody out there mega evolutions are evolutions mega sceptile mega charizard both dragon type yep question two which of the following types has been represented by only one starting pokemon evolution poison dark rock or ghost ghost ghost correct that would be uh decidueye question three which the following phrases is a mispronunciation of a phrase meaning to give specific focus orchest house cleaning hone in shine a light on hone in hone in yes because it's actually home in with an m not an n uh question four in fencing the phrase on guard means the opposite of the pokemon ability wonder guard no guard magic guard or friend guard no guard correct because on guard means to protect yourself and the no guard ability basically means that you can't protect yourself there's no ability to to avoid damage question five the following anime character used this week's pokemon in an episode before evolving it sawyer ash horcapus or serena harkipus no archips used to charge a all right because ash doesn't evolve anything occasionally all right who is the pokemon of the week [Music] shut up it's hoenege hone edge you are correct it is a steel ghost ghost steel hohn edge which means hone means to sharpen has the ability no guard and sawyer had one in the anime uh shuffle real good icon i like the red blade shiny yeah good job it's a good contrasty shiny the amount of people that came into my twitch stream and asked why i wasn't using magnet pole on hoenege was infuriating because magnet poll is an ability that outside of battle if a pokemon with magnet pole is placed in the first the party even when fainted there's a fifty percent chance the game will force an encounter with a steel type pokemon but in generation six the same generation honage was introduced steel type pokemon with the additional ghost typing are unaffected by magnet pull correct and uh the hone edge line are the only steel ghost so magnet pole does not work on honed and the amount of people that were like well it worked for me just just shows what is that confirmation bias yep yep it doesn't work you can uh deck what was that thing called radar scan for honeage the one who does it i've never done that you mean deck snap dexnet no no no the the sun and moon the scan the qr codes oh oh island island scan that's what it's called you can island scan for honing in that game um or i mean i think it's pretty straightforward to hunted and sword and shield now you can just literally see thousands of them in the wild area when it's foggy i think what's our pokemon next week okay pokemon for this week short sweet easy out of all the fruit vegetable and food based pokemon only one has a name that starts with the letter b this pokemon is based on a deep purple fruit grown in southeast asia it is difficult to find in the united states because it was banned for a very long time banned because of fear that importing the fruit would introduce a particular fly to the americas from asia as it stands the fruit must be irradiated as part of the import process the first and only time i ever tried to eat one i bit into it which you should not do as its rind is basically wood there you go is it just the eggplant emoji yeah yes pokemon of the week is the eggplant emoji have you eaten an eggplant why would i i like i like how his like whole thing is like why would i eat an eggplant because they're delicious they are good well but their skin is not wood actually their skin is edible all right eggplant parmesan mmm no no you gotta get the chinese like the the sejuan eggplant oh that is very good ooh tea house up here just does it so good that's one of brent's favorites you are listening to this podcast before october 8th our nintendo switch giveaway is still open it is uh in the show notes if you want to click the link completely free to enter uh we will be streaming crown tundra on the 23rd i will probably be streaming till midnight when it comes out but what i like to do is i like when the people watching are ahead of me so then they are not worried about spoilers so everyone who is the hardcore can play the night it comes out and then i will start on the 23rd at noon central time and then we'll stream for 12 hours so you know if you're watching you won't have to worry about spoilers as long as you started before i did which is probably very likely unless you work i guess also i'm assuming the story is gonna be like less than two hours long just like isle of armor so i don't know how much spoilers there will be long stream on the 23rd when it comes out twitch.tv slash pkm and cast we'll still have episodes we probably won't do a mini series i don't think when miniseries was needed for the isle of armor that episode on the 25th will probably not talk about the story and we'll save that for the first that gives you over a week so yeah october release for pokemon i think the last time we had that was x and y sounds about right yeah i think so um i mean yeah that was october 13th so yeah um pkmncast on instagram twitch youtube twitter uh i put out a youtube video a lot of people gave feedback that they liked the ultra beast conversation we had on the podcast and they thought it was interesting and a good derail so i expanded on those thoughts and i put it on youtube with graphics and pictures and all that stuff so that's on youtube right now otherwise greg is at white wing will is that washing the sink i'm at dragging a lake on twitter and this has been another episode of the pokemon podcast and we are super effective
