of mind you were pregaming too hard I&#39;m (0:31 - 0:37)
[Laughter] (0:35 - 0:40)
sure I no no not (0:37 - 0:42)
that I still I&#39;m still on my electric (0:40 - 0:44)
team I haven&#39;t even built a team for the (0:42 - 0:47)
event this week I&#39;m just (0:44 - 0:52)
chilling uh Bobby also here I am tired (0:47 - 0:53)
my sleep has not been great the last (0:52 - 0:55)
couple of nights and it&#39;s all because of (0:53 - 1:00)
one game Echo the dolphin (0:55 - 1:00)
an amazing game an amazing amazing game (1:00 - 1:04)
but it&#39;s been keeping me up late and (1:03 - 1:06)
it&#39;s been making my sleep scores bad in (1:04 - 1:09)
Pokemon sleep so not (1:06 - 1:14)
good well since this has become just a (1:09 - 1:16)
Pokemon sleep podcast we&#39;re going to be (1:14 - 1:18)
starting off with Pokemon sleep and then (1:16 - 1:20)
we have uh (1:18 - 1:24)
some anime news some uh scarlet and (1:20 - 1:26)
violet news and loow and behold we&#39;re (1:24 - 1:29)
going to be talking about GameStop this (1:26 - 1:32)
episode (1:29 - 1:36)
you you love to see it been a while it&#39;s (1:32 - 1:38)
been a while still in business that&#39;s (1:36 - 1:41)
the actual news um surprising let&#39;s (1:38 - 1:44)
start off with Pokemon sleep uh we are (1:41 - 1:46)
recording this on a Saturday afternoon (1:44 - 1:49)
which is not our normal recording time (1:46 - 1:53)
but uh we are still in fire week and (1:49 - 1:56)
then this upcoming Monday is (1:53 - 2:01)
nothing and then following that is is (1:56 - 2:04)
the two weeks of ente so I guess you (2:01 - 2:07)
have an extra week on topalo or an extra (2:04 - 2:09)
week anywhere that is not green grass (2:07 - 2:10)
unless you want to level up your green (2:09 - 2:12)
grass that that that is also helpful if (2:10 - 2:16)
your green grass is not leveled I guess (2:12 - 2:19)
but uh let&#39;s start with Hannah How is (2:16 - 2:20)
how&#39;s your fire fire week you said (2:19 - 2:22)
nothing prepared did you get a berry (2:20 - 2:25)
finding syndic Quil did you get a good (2:22 - 2:27)
Vulpix I haven&#39;t gotten anything (2:25 - 2:29)
particularly good but I have at least (2:27 - 2:32)
seen a Vulpix and seen a nine Tales so (2:29 - 2:34)
I&#39;m still getting those sleep Styles in (2:32 - 2:38)
that&#39;s the big thing for me this event I (2:34 - 2:40)
only need 11 more before I can unlock (2:38 - 2:44)
lapis because I&#39;m behind nice nice (2:40 - 2:47)
you&#39;re behind look at me Bobby started (2:44 - 2:50)
six months late (2:47 - 2:53)
yeah Bobby the big question here how (2:50 - 2:56)
much money have you given Pokemon sleep (2:53 - 2:59)
I have given Pokemon sleep a little bit (2:56 - 3:02)
of money so I well I&#39;m paying for (2:59 - 3:04)
premium so there&#39;s that right Hannah is (3:02 - 3:09)
not for the disclosure here yeah mhm and (3:04 - 3:15)
then I gave it $3 for the the trial (3:09 - 3:18)
bundle that you get when you start (3:15 - 3:20)
there&#39;s I don&#39;t remember it was like 600 (3:18 - 3:23)
diamonds and some poke biscuits it&#39;s a (3:20 - 3:25)
good deal yeah and a good camp ticket as (3:23 - 3:29)
well actually for like three bucks so I (3:25 - 3:32)
spent that and then there&#39;s the $10000 (3:29 - 3:35)
no I&#39;m just kidding uh it&#39;s just just $3 (3:32 - 3:39)
and then premium so not too bad although (3:35 - 3:41)
much quicker than I started spending (3:39 - 3:44)
money in go it took me a good like four (3:41 - 3:47)
months before I started spending money (3:44 - 3:50)
in Pokemon go so sleep sleep got me (3:47 - 3:53)
early so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how that pans (3:50 - 3:56)
out in the end but yeah yeah it is (3:53 - 3:57)
possible to play without the premium I (3:56 - 4:00)
think I&#39;ve actually spent $1 on a bundle (3:57 - 4:03)
once did you not get the the $3 bundle (4:00 - 4:06)
Hannah I thought you did that may have (4:03 - 4:08)
been the one I got that that probably (4:06 - 4:10)
was the one because it&#39;s such a good (4:08 - 4:13)
deal but I have not done premium beyond (4:10 - 4:14)
the free (4:13 - 4:17)
trial yeah I wait till they start being (4:14 - 4:20)
able to gift premium then we can gift (4:17 - 4:23)
you that would be lovely maybe I&#39;ll (4:20 - 4:24)
actually change my team away from ente (4:23 - 4:27)
then not ente (4:24 - 4:30)
Reiko uh well this is so this this makes (4:27 - 4:32)
a little bit more sense now to me (4:30 - 4:35)
because when I started playing it was (4:32 - 4:38)
right after it was like the week between (4:35 - 4:40)
like the electric week and the start of (4:38 - 4:42)
the raicho event where people were all (4:40 - 4:44)
confused and thought raicho started (4:42 - 4:46)
right after and you know and now I see (4:44 - 4:49)
now I see like okay we have fire week (4:46 - 4:52)
now there&#39;s a break I guess and then it (4:49 - 4:54)
jump there&#39;s two there&#39;s a pattern yeah (4:52 - 4:57)
now now we have the pattern I do think (4:54 - 4:59)
it&#39;s smart I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s (4:57 - 5:02)
intentional it seems intentional that (4:59 - 5:05)
both REO and ente overlap into a new (5:02 - 5:07)
month which gives you two opportunities (5:05 - 5:10)
to get two Master (5:07 - 5:12)
biscuits um again I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s (5:10 - 5:15)
like intent it feels intentional so like (5:12 - 5:17)
they both (5:15 - 5:21)
both weeks of like nothingness pushes it (5:17 - 5:24)
to overlap into the new month uh so that (5:21 - 5:26)
makes sense I makes sense to me at least (5:24 - 5:29)
well aren&#39;t the good sleep days always (5:26 - 5:31)
on a full moon yeah as well and these (5:29 - 5:34)
full moons are at the end of have been (5:31 - 5:36)
at the end of the month so it kind of (5:34 - 5:39)
it it does kind of work into that as (5:36 - 5:41)
well Pokemon sleep has made me add moon (5:39 - 5:44)
calendars to my calendar I can tell you (5:41 - 5:49)
the new moon is uh wait what month are (5:44 - 5:51)
we at right now well the new moon you&#39;re (5:49 - 5:53)
looking for the full moon the full moon (5:51 - 5:54)
is the (5:53 - 5:58)
21st of this month on (5:54 - 6:01)
Friday apparently at 8:08 p.m. according (5:58 - 6:04)
to my (6:01 - 6:04)
calendar uh so yeah good good sleep day (6:05 - 6:11)
coming up uh they push an update this is (6:07 - 6:13)
actually the news there&#39;s the (6:11 - 6:17)
1.7.2 update unlike Niantic it tells you (6:13 - 6:19)
what they change and what they fix uh (6:17 - 6:23)
communication very good here still (6:19 - 6:27)
they they are adjusting some Pokemon uh (6:23 - 6:29)
so gold duck which apparently people are (6:27 - 6:32)
saying has been an S tier Pokemon for a (6:29 - 6:35)
while because it&#39;s charge the charge (6:32 - 6:39)
thing it does to power up Snorlax um uh (6:35 - 6:40)
they&#39;re giving it more ingredient (6:39 - 6:44)
finding it&#39;s going to be times 1.2 and (6:40 - 6:45)
they&#39;re giving it a bigger carry limit (6:44 - 6:47)
of plus three these aren&#39;t like major (6:45 - 6:49)
Buffs by the way these are pretty minor (6:47 - 6:51)
uh they&#39;re trying to get people to use (6:49 - 6:53)
woba Fett main skill Chance is going up (6:51 - 6:57)
to 1.1 times so like a 10% Effectiveness (6:53 - 7:00)
increasing its carry limit to three and (6:57 - 7:03)
and then uh Persian and uh Persian is (7:00 - 7:05)
getting their frequency shortened by 200 (7:03 - 7:08)
seconds which and Lucario is getting (7:05 - 7:11)
their frequency shortened by 100 seconds (7:08 - 7:14)
these are both dream Shard magnet (7:11 - 7:18)
Pokemon and no one is using dream shart (7:14 - 7:19)
magnet (7:18 - 7:24)
Pokemon yep yep it&#39;s (7:19 - 7:24)
painful I have a good shiny Lucario I (7:24 - 7:30)
really wanted to use my shiny Lucario it (7:26 - 7:31)
is not (7:30 - 7:33)
useful that&#39;s a (7:31 - 7:37)
bummer so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think like you (7:33 - 7:39)
should be rushing out to use wobu Fett (7:37 - 7:42)
but it&#39;s nice that they&#39;re like changing (7:39 - 7:45)
some stuff positive like these are not (7:42 - 7:46)
Nerfs by any (7:45 - 7:49)
means uh they are they did do a (7:46 - 7:53)
Improvement to the Pokemon go Plus+ or (7:49 - 7:55)
didn&#39;t this update&#39;s not out yet for the (7:53 - 7:56)
record it comes (7:55 - 8:01)
out on the 13th (7:56 - 8:05)
from 20 o&#39; (8:01 - 8:05)
to uh last two and a half hours no four (8:06 - 8:12)
and a half hours you&#39;ll have maintenance (8:10 - 8:14)
for four and a half (8:12 - 8:18)
hours on the on the night of the 13th 20 (8:14 - 8:21)
o&#39;clock your time so 8:00 pm your time (8:18 - 8:24)
or every like because it the blog post (8:21 - 8:24)
is (8:24 - 8:31)
usually in UTC isn&#39;t it is it is it no (8:24 - 8:33)
cuz well I&#39;m just that&#39;s surprising for (8:31 - 8:36)
a time because it&#39;s usually at 6:00 p.m. (8:33 - 8:38)
Pacific because I was just complaining (8:36 - 8:40)
about this how you can&#39;t even get a shot (8:38 - 8:42)
at doing dinner they&#39;ve changed the (8:40 - 8:45)
timing some I think but usually yeah so (8:42 - 8:47)
that&#39;s the that&#39;s the big one for me is (8:45 - 8:48)
if it&#39;s (8:47 - 8:50)
actually not that I can&#39;t what I will (8:48 - 8:53)
say you will have a notice in the news (8:50 - 8:55)
in your app click on that it should be (8:53 - 8:58)
local time for you I know people (8:55 - 9:00)
probably skip past the news but they do (8:58 - 9:03)
give you like five days heads (9:00 - 9:06)
up so it&#39;s in there now yeah yeah it&#39;s (9:03 - 9:08)
in there now it should be there it does (9:06 - 9:11)
it&#39;s 6 p.m. Pacific so that 800 p.m. (9:08 - 9:13)
that 20:00 800 p.m. is your time Steve (9:11 - 9:15)
it&#39;s it looks like the blog post (9:13 - 9:16)
actually updates based on your own time (9:15 - 9:19)
too yeah oh that&#39;s cool yeah they should (9:16 - 9:21)
say like they should put like CST or (9:19 - 9:24)
whatever that would be helpful yeah that (9:21 - 9:26)
is weird that doesn&#39;t at least say local (9:24 - 9:29)
or something to let you know what um (9:26 - 9:32)
okay go back to the Pokémon go Plus+ uh (9:29 - 9:34)
improvements so regular sleep research (9:32 - 9:37)
can be conducted for both sessions when (9:34 - 9:39)
two sleep sessions tracking are reported (9:37 - 9:44)
at the same time via the go Plus+ when (9:39 - 9:47)
three or more sleep tracking sessions (9:44 - 9:49)
are reported regular sleep research will (9:47 - 9:52)
be conducted once and the rest will all (9:49 - 9:55)
be included in one report as (9:52 - 9:59)
normal I like that change okay can you (9:55 - 10:01)
explain expl that change as somebody cuz (9:59 - 10:03)
you you you&#39;ve done this Hannah where (10:01 - 10:06)
you&#39;ve like saved up multiple yeah where (10:03 - 10:08)
I&#39;ve been lazy and I haven&#39;t checked the (10:06 - 10:09)
app for three days but I&#39;ve kept (10:08 - 10:11)
pressing the button on the Plus+ to get (10:09 - 10:14)
the tracking okay so how is this working (10:11 - 10:17)
usually when you do that when you quote (10:14 - 10:19)
unquote Miss more than one day by just (10:17 - 10:20)
not logging into the app but keep (10:19 - 10:23)
pressing the button then when you open (10:20 - 10:26)
up the app finally eventually you get to (10:23 - 10:28)
do a normal sleep research for your most (10:26 - 10:30)
recent night which means means you get (10:28 - 10:32)
to actually intentionally check the (10:30 - 10:34)
Pokémon and feed the Pokemon that you (10:32 - 10:37)
want to be feeding and the rest are kind (10:34 - 10:39)
of done automatically and summarized up (10:37 - 10:41)
for you and so it gives random Pokemon (10:39 - 10:44)
the bonus biscuit from the other sleep (10:41 - 10:47)
research days and it sounds like this (10:44 - 10:49)
change means that you&#39;re going to get to (10:47 - 10:52)
intentionally feed Pokemon for two of (10:49 - 10:56)
those nights instead of just the one oh (10:52 - 10:58)
it I didn&#39;t even realize it saved up (10:56 - 11:00)
that you could I thought it just if you (10:58 - 11:03)
missed one the next time you started it (11:00 - 11:05)
it just skipped over the one before that (11:03 - 11:07)
I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;ve got a shiny (11:05 - 11:10)
Caterpie that way right did yeah you did (11:07 - 11:13)
mention that that&#39;s (11:10 - 11:13)
right uh there they are also saying if (11:14 - 11:19)
you&#39;re a new player sorry Bobby this is (11:17 - 11:20)
no longer (11:19 - 11:24)
you uh for your first seven sleep (11:20 - 11:28)
sessions one Pokemon will always be (11:24 - 11:31)
hungry so your a lot that&#39;s a really (11:28 - 11:33)
good change so again we we need a (11:31 - 11:35)
referral code for this podcast because (11:33 - 11:37)
the amount of people we&#39;ve signed up for (11:35 - 11:39)
Pokemon sleep astronomically High I&#39;m (11:37 - 11:42)
sure of it but if you haven&#39;t started (11:39 - 11:44)
playing Pokemon sleep they&#39;re saying the (11:42 - 11:46)
first seven times you play the game you (11:44 - 11:49)
will get one Pokemon hungry for sure (11:46 - 11:50)
these are just Pokemon that are easier (11:49 - 11:55)
to catch uh off the bat um it this does (11:50 - 11:57)
not apply if you do two sleep sessions (11:55 - 11:59)
in one day only your first sleep session (11:57 - 12:01)
of the day (11:59 - 12:04)
they&#39;re also adding perks to novice (12:01 - 12:06)
researcher bonus they didn&#39;t really (12:04 - 12:10)
expand on what that is um they&#39;re (12:06 - 12:12)
changing some stuff so changes to the (12:10 - 12:15)
condition for when sleep XP bonus gauge (12:12 - 12:18)
applies before change during sleep (12:15 - 12:20)
research applied when any helper on the (12:18 - 12:23)
team reached current max level of 55 (12:20 - 12:25)
regardless of users research rank after (12:23 - 12:28)
the change during sleep research will (12:25 - 12:29)
apply to any helper on the team who&#39;s (12:28 - 12:32)
reach max level possible for the user&#39;s (12:29 - 12:34)
research rank at the (12:32 - 12:38)
time uh and then the Sleep bonus gauge (12:34 - 12:40)
if the team includes any helper Pokemon (12:38 - 12:44)
that reach max level any sleep XP earned (12:40 - 12:46)
through the Sleep research is added to (12:44 - 12:48)
the Sleep XP bonus gauge each time the (12:46 - 12:50)
bonus gauge fills up to 500 XP you will (12:48 - 12:54)
receive one handy candy small which is (12:50 - 12:56)
just rare candy so I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s (12:54 - 12:58)
not called rare candy but that&#39;s what it (12:56 - 13:02)
is not like the name um so what is (12:58 - 13:07)
the what is the level Max based on rank (13:02 - 13:09)
like is it is it equal (13:07 - 13:13)
or so if you&#39;re ranked 25 can you how (13:09 - 13:16)
high can you level a Pokemon 55 oh it (13:13 - 13:18)
doesn&#39;t matter what rank you are I don&#39;t (13:16 - 13:19)
think (13:18 - 13:22)
so not that I know of unless there was (13:19 - 13:26)
an older change or they did change it um (13:22 - 13:27)
but I was I was like (13:26 - 13:30)
level like 40 (13:27 - 13:33)
and my Wiggly tough was 52 did I Mis (13:30 - 13:34)
understand what you said then I thought (13:33 - 13:37)
you said that if the Pokemon Maxes its (13:34 - 13:40)
level based on your rank it would get (13:37 - 13:42)
there&#39;s a bonus that would used to only (13:40 - 13:44)
happen when the Pokemon was level 55 and (13:42 - 13:47)
your rank was that high I think they&#39;re (13:44 - 13:50)
saying that (13:47 - 13:53)
like the game isn&#39;t recognizing 55 as (13:50 - 13:56)
the max level it&#39;s recognizing it as 55 (13:53 - 13:59)
out of 100 whereas they&#39;re saying right (13:56 - 14:03)
now now 55 is the max level got it okay (13:59 - 14:06)
that&#39;s my (14:03 - 14:06)
interpretation because it says any (14:06 - 14:10)
helper Pokemon that reached the current (14:09 - 14:13)
max level of 55 regardless of your rank (14:10 - 14:16)
after the change when the team has (14:13 - 14:18)
reached the max level (14:16 - 14:21)
possible for the research rank at the (14:18 - 14:24)
time max level possible is (14:21 - 14:27)
55 that makes me think that maybe going (14:24 - 14:29)
forward yeah they&#39;re going to make it (14:27 - 14:31)
based on the research (14:29 - 14:34)
Rank and have levels unlocked based on (14:31 - 14:37)
the research rank I&#39;ve only been going (14:34 - 14:39)
to increase it like they&#39;re going to (14:37 - 14:40)
increase it or (14:39 - 14:43)
something yeah maybe somebody in the (14:40 - 14:45)
slack or Discord or our YouTube comments (14:43 - 14:48)
can maybe interpret this a little bit (14:45 - 14:51)
better I would assume for the majority (14:48 - 14:53)
of players they are not 55 and this is (14:51 - 14:55)
something they don&#39;t have to worry (14:53 - 14:58)
about not even (14:55 - 15:01)
close but those hardcore players feel (14:58 - 15:06)
free to correct what that means um yeah (15:01 - 15:10)
so some updates and then ente will show (15:06 - 15:12)
up uh the one thing I want to say about (15:10 - 15:15)
the fire type week (15:12 - 15:19)
is I I feel like this is what topollo (15:15 - 15:24)
should always feel like like yeah (15:19 - 15:27)
getting Vulpix seeing more syndic Quil (15:24 - 15:29)
seeing more Charmander (15:27 - 15:32)
um kind of less geodudes less rattatas (15:29 - 15:34)
less Crow gunks although like I feel (15:32 - 15:36)
like every time I get a Pokemon on top (15:34 - 15:39)
of Snorlax belly it&#39;s always toxic cro (15:36 - 15:41)
every single time I don&#39;t need toxic cro (15:39 - 15:44)
anymore he can just go (15:41 - 15:47)
away but it this is the first week where (15:44 - 15:50)
it genuinely feels like topollo has been (15:47 - 15:53)
fun to like (15:50 - 15:55)
do and I think that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been (15:53 - 15:56)
trying to say for like the last couple (15:55 - 16:00)
weeks is po areas that are are not green (15:56 - 16:02)
grass with the exception of I think (16:00 - 16:05)
lapis don&#39;t have enough variety where it (16:02 - 16:07)
just feels like you go to this new you (16:05 - 16:08)
go to this new area you get really (16:07 - 16:09)
excited and then all of a sudden it&#39;s (16:08 - 16:11)
like the same Pokemon you&#39;ve been seeing (16:09 - 16:13)
on green (16:11 - 16:16)
grass yeah well I&#39;ve only been on green (16:13 - 16:19)
grass during the raicho event and the (16:16 - 16:21)
week before that so uh like you were (16:19 - 16:24)
saying before like I&#39;m thinking that I (16:21 - 16:27)
might actually be going to Green Grass (16:24 - 16:28)
next week (16:27 - 16:32)
to exper again like just cuz I&#39;ve been (16:28 - 16:34)
it&#39;s like Topo and Canan beach every (16:32 - 16:37)
other week uh and as much as I love (16:34 - 16:39)
Top&#39;s music and don&#39;t want to go away (16:37 - 16:43)
from that I probably should move over (16:39 - 16:45)
just to get some variety because yeah to (16:43 - 16:49)
your point I&#39;ve seen so many Crow Gunk (16:45 - 16:52)
so many geod dude like so many dud is (16:49 - 16:55)
actually like a good pokon and and the (16:52 - 16:57)
thing is is I need more of those sleep (16:55 - 17:00)
Styles right because I&#39;m way fur behind (16:57 - 17:02)
I still need I&#39;m at I need four sleep (17:00 - 17:06)
styles to open up um was it called snow (17:02 - 17:09)
drop yeah yeah and to be able to expand (17:06 - 17:11)
my pot further and things like that you (17:09 - 17:14)
know so I I I&#39;m four away but if I stick (17:11 - 17:17)
a topollo it&#39;s just not gonna happen you (17:14 - 17:20)
know because yeah it&#39;s just geod dude (17:17 - 17:24)
800 times and and none of them are good (17:20 - 17:26)
if I just could get a good one at least (17:24 - 17:27)
I would be happy but none of them are (17:26 - 17:31)
good you&#39;re still too to be finding good (17:27 - 17:34)
Pokemon you have to catch more of them (17:31 - 17:38)
I&#39;m like 14 syndic Quil in and not a (17:34 - 17:40)
single good one I got a quava though (17:38 - 17:42)
that has Barry finding s at (17:40 - 17:44)
50 (17:42 - 17:49)
oh that&#39;s tough I know it&#39;s so (17:44 - 17:51)
close but so (17:49 - 17:55)
far yeah I mean it&#39;s just it just it (17:51 - 17:57)
hurts when I think I caught like three (17:55 - 17:59)
Pokemon yesterday (17:57 - 18:02)
like two syndic Quil and a Charmander or (17:59 - 18:03)
two syndic Quil and a Vulpix or (18:02 - 18:05)
something and I went in and just they (18:03 - 18:10)
were all terrible and I&#39;m like (18:05 - 18:10)
I I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know (18:10 - 18:16)
yeah it&#39;s just feels bad it&#39;s real rough (18:13 - 18:18)
out (18:16 - 18:18)
there good game though oh great game my (18:19 - 18:26)
my favorite Pokemon game right now my (18:24 - 18:30)
favorite Pokemon game (18:26 - 18:31)
uh all right shifting gears here a (18:30 - 18:33)
little bit uh we have this is off (18:31 - 18:36)
pokemon.com uh May 10th this was (18:33 - 18:38)
yesterday Pokemon Horizons the series (18:36 - 18:41)
part two now available on (18:38 - 18:44)
Netflix uh get ready for the incredible (18:41 - 18:45)
journey across the vast Pokemon world (18:44 - 18:48)
with Leo spatio Roy Fu Coco and their (18:45 - 18:51)
friends the rising volt tacklers in part (18:48 - 18:54)
two they will continue to chart their (18:51 - 18:56)
course towards the Galler region sword (18:54 - 19:00)
and shield remakes confirmed (18:56 - 19:00)
uh that&#39;s it I don&#39;t want to read (19:03 - 19:07)
anymore for spoiler purposes for for (19:05 - 19:11)
some people but uh I still live off the (19:07 - 19:14)
uh cancel my Netflix if I&#39;m not using it (19:11 - 19:15)
I have not been using it after I (19:14 - 19:16)
finished (19:15 - 19:21)
it I&#39;m leaving for Japan in like 10 days (19:16 - 19:26)
and then Spain shortly after so I don&#39;t (19:21 - 19:27)
think I&#39;m going to renew my Netflix (19:26 - 19:30)
until maybe I get back (19:27 - 19:32)
cuz (19:30 - 19:36)
I feel like Netflix on Japanese Wi-Fi (19:32 - 19:39)
will not have Pokemon Horizons because (19:36 - 19:42)
that would be on probably true TV so I (19:39 - 19:44)
will get locked out of it can you not (19:42 - 19:47)
download the episodes on Netflix and (19:44 - 19:50)
then have them on your we assuming that (19:47 - 19:52)
I got the bigger iPad I probably got the (19:50 - 19:55)
minimum storage I and you&#39;d have to keep (19:52 - 19:57)
it off of the internet the whole time (19:55 - 19:59)
you were watching them right if I think (19:57 - 20:02)
that&#39;s true I think as soon as you (19:59 - 20:03)
connect to the internet it will still (20:02 - 20:06)
want to verify your location and it will (20:03 - 20:07)
block that content oh I was just (20:06 - 20:09)
thinking for the plane I mean how many (20:07 - 20:13)
episodes is it 10 maybe 10 12 that&#39;s a (20:09 - 20:14)
Japan that&#39;s a plane ride to Japan (20:13 - 20:16)
that&#39;s not yeah but my plan is to always (20:14 - 20:19)
sleep on the plane oh good luck good for (20:16 - 20:21)
you that you can sleep on a plane (20:19 - 20:24)
because I cannot the strategy is cuz my (20:21 - 20:28)
flight is at I think it&#39;s at like 11:00 (20:24 - 20:29)
a.m. on Tuesday (20:28 - 20:32)
so if I just don&#39;t go to bed on Monday (20:29 - 20:35)
night and then I will be so (20:32 - 20:37)
tired I will fall asleep on the plane (20:35 - 20:39)
and then when I get to Japan I think (20:37 - 20:42)
it&#39;s like 2 p.m. and then it&#39;s I&#39;m like (20:39 - 20:42)
normal (20:42 - 20:45)
[Laughter] (20:42 - 20:49)
day okay that&#39;s one way to do it (20:45 - 20:51)
uh uh sure if it works as long as it (20:49 - 20:54)
works that&#39;s the real thing it has (20:51 - 20:56)
worked the last two times to Japan so (20:54 - 20:58)
yeah yeah so wait here&#39;s the real (20:56 - 21:00)
question question though did you buy a (20:58 - 21:04)
new iPad no oh okay okay okay when you (21:00 - 21:07)
said that okay I just you said bigger (21:04 - 21:09)
you said storage and I thought oh did (21:07 - 21:12)
you actually buy a new iPad no I have an (21:09 - 21:16)
iPad Air the M1 iPad Air oh okay and I (21:12 - 21:18)
think it&#39;s only whatever the lowest (21:16 - 21:21)
storage is I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think I what (21:18 - 21:23)
what are people putting on their iPads (21:21 - 21:26)
pictures I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think I (21:23 - 21:28)
don&#39;t think the Horizon&#39;s 10 episodes (21:26 - 21:31)
though is like 64 (21:28 - 21:33)
GB that&#39;s probably (21:31 - 21:36)
true that&#39;s probably (21:33 - 21:38)
accurate I would assume that each (21:36 - 21:40)
episode is probably like a (21:38 - 21:44)
gig no like a movie is like a unless (21:40 - 21:46)
you&#39;re watching them in like 8K or (21:44 - 21:48)
something that&#39;s how I want to see my (21:46 - 21:51)
quackley in (21:48 - 21:51)
8k I think you could probably fit a fair (21:52 - 21:56)
number of them plus you have a week (21:54 - 21:59)
before leaving and there are only 12 (21:56 - 22:01)
episodes and they are less than half an (21:59 - 22:04)
hour each they&#39;re all 21 to 24 minutes I (22:01 - 22:07)
could probably subscribe (22:04 - 22:10)
tonight and crank them all out tonight (22:07 - 22:13)
Sunday evening yeah like I (22:10 - 22:17)
could um and then I could test to see (22:13 - 22:19)
how much storage I have for my my plane (22:17 - 22:21)
ride when I cannot (22:19 - 22:24)
sleep uh Bobby did you I can&#39;t remember (22:21 - 22:26)
did you watch the first 12 or (22:24 - 22:30)
no I didn&#39;t I said I was going to and I (22:26 - 22:33)
didn&#39;t so would would that be something (22:30 - 22:36)
your kids are interested you your kids (22:33 - 22:37)
are watching the (22:36 - 22:40)
original anime yeah yeah they&#39;ve watched (22:37 - 22:42)
a fair amount of the Indigo League uh is (22:40 - 22:44)
this like this parent thing where like I (22:42 - 22:47)
grew up on the Nintendo 64 so I&#39;m going (22:44 - 22:50)
to make my kids play Nintendo 64 and not (22:47 - 22:53)
the PlayStation 5 that&#39;s not that&#39;s not (22:50 - 22:56)
the situation here uh although I do (22:53 - 22:57)
think everyone that plays Pokemon should (22:56 - 22:59)
start with Pokemon Red and blue (22:57 - 23:03)
otherwise fake fan uh no just kidding um (22:59 - 23:06)
so we only started watching Indigo (23:03 - 23:08)
League because it was like the only (23:06 - 23:09)
thing available on (23:08 - 23:13)
Netflix I think that was the only season (23:09 - 23:15)
available thing available well okay (23:13 - 23:18)
wasse whatever was brand new at the time (23:15 - 23:20)
when we started watching it which was (23:18 - 23:21)
probably some kind of was sword and (23:20 - 23:24)
shield some kind was it yeah Journeys (23:21 - 23:27)
was Journeys yeah was there too but (23:24 - 23:29)
because I wanted to talk to them them (23:27 - 23:32)
like we were talking about Pokemon and (23:29 - 23:34)
they play Pokémon go on my phone so a (23:32 - 23:36)
lot of the Pokemon they see because CU (23:34 - 23:38)
Niantic loves Kanto a lot of the Pokemon (23:36 - 23:42)
that they see have you rediscovered it (23:38 - 23:42)
recently uh so they know a lot of the (23:42 - 23:48)
Kanto Pokemon not because I forced Kanto (23:45 - 23:50)
onto them because Niantic forces Kanto (23:48 - 23:54)
onto them uh so watching Indigo League (23:50 - 23:56)
felt like it made more sense since they (23:54 - 23:59)
would know a lot more of the Pokemon (23:56 - 24:00)
Journeys would have been pretty good (23:59 - 24:04)
there too and it was not bad yeah well (24:00 - 24:06)
we we&#39;ll get there I&#39;m not going to make (24:04 - 24:09)
them go through like the whole like (24:06 - 24:10)
series to get there I mean I I think (24:09 - 24:12)
that they would like watching Horizons I (24:10 - 24:16)
just um been watching other stuff lately (24:12 - 24:18)
we talked about this last time but I (24:16 - 24:20)
know but like I think like if so if (24:18 - 24:23)
you&#39;re if you&#39;re parent with kids MH cuz (24:20 - 24:25)
I think Hannah and I are a little (24:23 - 24:27)
disconnected since we don&#39;t have (24:25 - 24:30)
kids Hannah&#39;s hiding something (24:27 - 24:34)
over no if you were if you were like I (24:30 - 24:36)
am subscribing to Netflix (24:34 - 24:40)
tonight kids do you want to watch brand (24:36 - 24:41)
new Pokemon do you think they would be (24:40 - 24:43)
like would your kids be excited and like (24:41 - 24:45)
sit down and like want to watch as many (24:43 - 24:48)
episodes as possible yeah definitely oh (24:45 - 24:50)
for sure no yeah my kids like Pokemon (24:48 - 24:53)
and like kids I think like Pokemon I (24:50 - 24:54)
mean we started watching it at when we (24:53 - 24:57)
were older obviously because well I (24:54 - 25:00)
don&#39;t know about Hannah but St I were 10 (24:57 - 25:02)
when it came out so we couldn&#39;t watch it (25:00 - 25:04)
before then but I liked it as a kid I (25:02 - 25:05)
tried to get my little brothers into (25:04 - 25:07)
Pokemon as a kid this is the experience (25:05 - 25:09)
I&#39;ve had that I was the older sister (25:07 - 25:11)
where I tried to get my little brothers (25:09 - 25:12)
into Pokemon through the anime and (25:11 - 25:15)
through the games and eventually they (25:12 - 25:17)
got tired of it and just thought I was (25:15 - 25:19)
the nerdy older sister and have not (25:17 - 25:21)
played or watched Pokemon for probably (25:19 - 25:24)
15 years but I really (25:21 - 25:26)
tried that didn&#39;t end the way I thought (25:24 - 25:30)
it was going to (25:26 - 25:30)
yeah sometimes that happens I think (25:30 - 25:36)
maybe prepare yourself just in case yeah (25:33 - 25:40)
yeah no had that thought many (25:36 - 25:43)
times I I was in I was in (25:40 - 25:47)
Florida and uh there were there were a (25:43 - 25:50)
bunch of kids running around at the the (25:47 - 25:50)
the (25:50 - 25:53)
Regionals and I overheard one kid point (25:50 - 25:57)
at the karant sign and go I don&#39;t know (25:53 - 26:00)
who that is (25:57 - 26:00)
and I was very (26:01 - 26:04)
sad a real bummer on that one (26:06 - 26:12)
yeah I mean it&#39;s not too (26:10 - 26:16)
surprising my kids know crar is he he (26:12 - 26:18)
had he was in a movie he was in this a (26:16 - 26:20)
rude movie yeah they&#39;ve really tried I (26:18 - 26:22)
mean kar&#39;s (26:20 - 26:26)
been a fair number of places very much (26:22 - 26:29)
in unite definitely in the C for scarlet (26:26 - 26:31)

releasing the Next Generation we&#39;re (26:59 - 27:02)
just&#39;re going to do it anyways yeah (27:01 - 27:04)
we&#39;re going to do it anyways we&#39;re going (27:02 - 27:07)
to do release the new (27:04 - 27:07)
generation speaking real quick before we (27:08 - 27:13)
take our break speaking of Pokemon go I (27:11 - 27:14)
I watched a YouTube video about like (27:13 - 27:16)
dark patterns in mobile games and (27:14 - 27:20)
Monopoly go is like number one in that (27:16 - 27:22)
even though Monopoly go does look is it (27:20 - 27:23)
called Monopoly go I&#39;m not sure what (27:22 - 27:25)
it&#39;s called it&#39;s literally if I open my (27:23 - 27:27)
app store it&#39;s like featured it&#39;s like (27:25 - 27:29)
rated one of the Mo has the most dark (27:27 - 27:32)
patterns it does legitimately look like (27:29 - 27:34)
a fun game that you can play for 10 (27:32 - 27:36)
minutes and then 12 hours later you can (27:34 - 27:38)
because it&#39;s timer based so like 12 (27:36 - 27:40)
hours later you can you can pay to make (27:38 - 27:42)
the timer go up it does look okay but (27:40 - 27:45)
they the video talked about how it has a (27:42 - 27:47)
lot of dark patterns and they were like (27:45 - 27:49)
if you go to this website you can see (27:47 - 27:52)
games that have dark patterns it&#39;s all (27:49 - 27:54)
user generated so it&#39;s like users rating (27:52 - 27:56)
like oh I noticed this dark pattern the (27:54 - 27:58)
number one game was surprisingly not (27:56 - 28:00)
Monopoly go it was like a Jurassic Park (27:58 - 28:02)
mobile game and there&#39;s like seven (28:00 - 28:03)
Jurassic Park mobile games so I&#39;m not (28:02 - 28:06)
sure which of the Jurassic Park mobile (28:03 - 28:08)
games but it was rated the absolute (28:06 - 28:10)
worst when it came to dark patterns it (28:08 - 28:13)
took me a couple pages to get to Pokemon (28:10 - 28:17)
go but out of all the Pokemon games (28:13 - 28:21)
Pokemon go was the most dark patterns (28:17 - 28:23)
really uh which I guess if you don&#39;t (28:21 - 28:26)
know what a dark pattern is it&#39;s it&#39;s (28:23 - 28:29)
it&#39;s like a way to (28:26 - 28:31)
get you to do something that you (28:29 - 28:32)
normally like it&#39;s a way to get like get (28:31 - 28:34)
you to spend money or to like not (28:32 - 28:36)
actually cancel your subscription you (28:34 - 28:38)
know how like when you go to like cancel (28:36 - 28:41)
like Amazon Prime like the the cancel (28:38 - 28:43)
button will be in like red and then the (28:41 - 28:45)
continue button will be in green so your (28:43 - 28:47)
mind is like oh green to continue but (28:45 - 28:49)
you&#39;re actually just keeping your (28:47 - 28:51)
subscription yeah those are dark (28:49 - 28:55)
patterns um the game that so Pokemon (28:51 - 28:56)
sleep wasn&#39;t on the list I did check (28:55 - 28:59)
because it&#39;s so new (28:56 - 29:01)
um the game that had the least amount of (28:59 - 29:04)
dark patterns which I think is incorrect (29:01 - 29:06)
because I just don&#39;t think enough people (29:04 - 29:08)
play it was Cafe remix I was going to (29:06 - 29:10)
say that&#39;s the one I was expecting to (29:08 - 29:13)
have the most yeah but that that&#39;s the (29:10 - 29:14)
problem with the website is it&#39;s user (29:13 - 29:16)
generated so obviously the most people (29:14 - 29:21)
play Pokemon go yeah um that&#39;s that game (29:16 - 29:24)
sneaks stuff in everywhere yeah I would (29:21 - 29:25)
I would I would assume that Cafe remix (29:24 - 29:27)
would be worse than I think the second (29:25 - 29:31)
worst Pokemon game was unite (29:27 - 29:34)
mhm uh and I read some of the reviews on (29:31 - 29:35)
unite and they were like pay to win pay (29:34 - 29:37)
to win pay to win which I don&#39;t I don&#39;t (29:35 - 29:40)
think it&#39;s pay to win at all um but (29:37 - 29:44)
that&#39;s like a whole another conversation (29:40 - 29:44)
about I I thought you only paid for uh (29:45 - 29:51)
Aesthetics in Pokemon unite clearly I (29:49 - 29:52)
don&#39;t play the game so but I thought it (29:51 - 29:54)
was just for clothing and stuff that you (29:52 - 29:56)
paid for it is now when it first (29:54 - 29:58)
launched there was like paying to like (29:56 - 30:02)
accelerate to get your items to level up (29:58 - 30:06)
the the three items you have yeah and (30:02 - 30:09)
that doesn&#39;t like matter anymore like (30:06 - 30:11)
the items your Pokemon are holding still (30:09 - 30:14)
matter um but like leveling them doesn&#39;t (30:11 - 30:16)
matter as much as people think they do I (30:14 - 30:18)
feel like we&#39;re going to get a lot of (30:16 - 30:20)
people a lot of unite players who are (30:18 - 30:22)
going to disagree with this I will get (30:20 - 30:25)
zoinks on the show and Z zoinks (30:22 - 30:27)
commentates Pokemon unite full time and (30:25 - 30:29)
he will tell you that it&#39;s definitely (30:27 - 30:31)
not paay to (30:29 - 30:35)
win I know zoink is listening uh okay (30:31 - 30:38)
okay let&#39;s take a break uh when we come (30:35 - 30:41)

yeah so we have the shop I usually go to (31:42 - 31:48)
which just sells them like without do (31:45 - 31:49)
like the tournament because that&#39;s how (31:48 - 31:52)
they did it for a while when Co hit I (31:49 - 31:53)
think I think they&#39;re not supposed to do (31:52 - 31:55)
that yeah I&#39;m anymore I&#39;m not naming (31:53 - 31:59)
them any shops um there are shops let (31:55 - 32:03)
there are shops in San Diego um but they (31:59 - 32:04)
do sign people up and everything so (32:03 - 32:06)
there&#39;s tournaments that happen during (32:04 - 32:09)
that time but um they start two weeks (32:06 - 32:12)
before um and then they have tournaments (32:09 - 32:14)
a few different tournaments throughout (32:12 - 32:17)
the two weeks leading up to the release (32:14 - 32:18)
of the (32:17 - 32:21)
sets yeah so Rel the official release (32:18 - 32:22)
date is May (32:21 - 32:27)
24th 160 cards I will say uh just (32:22 - 32:28)
disclosure the Pokemon company did send (32:27 - 32:31)
me a box of cards they&#39;ve been at my PO (32:28 - 32:34)
box for the last couple I&#39;ll eventually (32:31 - 32:36)
go pick them up and then open them (32:34 - 32:38)
eventually but there&#39;s your (32:36 - 32:42)
disclosure uh this is the set with ogre (32:38 - 32:45)
Pon yeah and the loyal (32:42 - 32:48)
three uh anything anything in Bobby give (32:45 - 32:50)
us the download of the TCG world what (32:48 - 32:52)
what is what is the chase C here what do (32:50 - 32:55)
people actually want from this set well (32:52 - 32:57)
I think the one that is really po (32:55 - 33:00)
definitely popular with me but is very (32:57 - 33:03)
popular um is there&#39;s there&#39;s two cards (33:00 - 33:06)
one is this is on the collector side I (33:03 - 33:07)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t think these cards are (33:06 - 33:09)
playable at all uh or are very playable (33:07 - 33:13)
there is a parin card that is a special (33:09 - 33:15)
illustration where she is holding a (33:13 - 33:17)
camera and you can see in the reflection (33:15 - 33:19)
of the camera is a Hui her Hui and (33:17 - 33:22)
growth oh it&#39;s this set yeah and there&#39;s (33:19 - 33:24)
an illustration rare card that is the (33:22 - 33:27)
huian growth looking up at what you (33:24 - 33:29)
assume is par and looking down so if you (33:27 - 33:31)
were to take the cards and maybe have (33:29 - 33:35)
them face each other they would match up (33:31 - 33:37)
so yeah that&#39;s the those are the two (33:35 - 33:40)
that a lot of people are really after uh (33:37 - 33:43)
other than that there&#39;s a Gren ninja (33:40 - 33:46)
that people are really after as well and (33:43 - 33:49)
for playability there&#39;s a gold buddy (33:46 - 33:51)
buddy pfin and I believe the Buddy Buddy (33:49 - 33:53)
Puffin cards are quite right now they (33:51 - 33:56)
replaced uh VIP pass in the competitive (33:53 - 33:58)
format so that would make sense yeah so (33:56 - 34:00)
a gold one so if you want to be fancy (33:58 - 34:02)
with your deck you go after that gold oh (34:00 - 34:04)
that was me when I played you had to (34:02 - 34:05)
have all the gold cards all the reverse (34:04 - 34:07)
holos all the hollow (34:05 - 34:11)
energies I was obnoxious there you go (34:07 - 34:14)
gota be fancy with it uh so that is yeah (34:11 - 34:15)
there is that gold and then there&#39;s ogre (34:14 - 34:17)
Pon so as far as the special (34:15 - 34:19)
illustration rares go in this set there (34:17 - 34:22)
are four ogre Pon cards that are special (34:19 - 34:23)
illustration rares because it&#39;s each of (34:22 - 34:26)
the masks they&#39;re all different types so (34:23 - 34:28)
I think there are like 12 or 16 ogre (34:26 - 34:31)
Pond cards in this set because there is (34:28 - 34:32)
she&#39;s a queen she needs all the (34:31 - 34:34)
attention there&#39;s the regular ex and (34:32 - 34:36)
then there&#39;s a couple in the full art (34:34 - 34:37)
category and then there&#39;s the special (34:36 - 34:39)
illustration rare across there there&#39;s a (34:37 - 34:43)
promo in the ETB that&#39;s ogre Pon so it&#39;s (34:39 - 34:47)
an ogre Pon set for sure amazing (34:43 - 34:50)
yeah yep what&#39;s the next set after this (34:47 - 34:52)
wasn&#39;t there weird timing with the (34:50 - 34:56)
recent English sets yeah like this was a (34:52 - 34:58)
little quick wasn&#39;t it it was it&#39;s only (34:56 - 35:01)
two it was literally like two months two (34:58 - 35:02)
months and two days between the last set (35:01 - 35:04)
and this one and then there&#39;s a special (35:02 - 35:07)
set that&#39;s releasing at the beginning of (35:04 - 35:12)
August that pretty quick yeah so there&#39;s (35:07 - 35:15)
that and then I think it&#39;s going to (35:12 - 35:18)
be into the fall into Autumn time frame (35:15 - 35:20)
for the set following that (35:18 - 35:23)
but that&#39;s what&#39;s coming up I (35:20 - 35:25)
think there&#39;s a new set that just came (35:23 - 35:27)
out in Japan or that just got announced (35:25 - 35:29)
in Japan (35:27 - 35:33)
night Wanderer yeah and I think tagos is (35:29 - 35:35)
in that (35:33 - 35:40)
and yeah I have night Wanderer TCG the (35:35 - 35:41)
self (35:40 - 35:44)
Bulbapedia um the name of the fifth (35:41 - 35:45)
Japanese subset for the scarlet and (35:44 - 35:48)
violet ERA this will focus on the (35:45 - 35:51)
mythical Pokemon petun and the loyal 3 (35:48 - 35:55)
release date June 7th oh man I leave (35:51 - 35:59)
Japan on June 2nd uh that&#39;s a (35:55 - 36:03)
bummer um it will feature oky doggy (35:59 - 36:07)
monkey Dory fundip petun kierum binding (36:03 - 36:11)
Mochi Kus ten tend (36:07 - 36:15)
tenacity ten tenacity that&#39;s a word uh (36:11 - 36:18)
and then neutral Center which is an ace (36:15 - 36:22)
back card yeah so I think that&#39;s the (36:18 - 36:25)
last set that&#39;s going to be teal mask (36:22 - 36:27)
related that would make sense yeah since (36:25 - 36:28)
it (36:27 - 36:30)
run yeah but it&#39;s also the level three (36:28 - 36:32)
so I I think it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s got the last (36:30 - 36:35)
and then it&#39;s going to jump into so (36:32 - 36:37)
maybe the next set after that Tera goes (36:35 - 36:41)
I don&#39;t know but it&#39;s we got sets coming (36:37 - 36:46)
out yeah the TCG machine does not stop (36:41 - 36:47)
not slowing down no it&#39;s not slowing (36:46 - 36:50)
down anytime (36:47 - 36:53)
soon this is going to continue our TCG (36:50 - 36:56)
news this is off The Verge GameStop will (36:53 - 37:01)
buy and sell rare Pokemon cards but it (36:56 - 37:02)
okay well we don&#39;t need to read the (37:01 - 37:03)
whole headline here who&#39;s the author (37:02 - 37:06)
Sean uh senior editor at The Verge uh (37:03 - 37:10)
this is a collaboration with PSA one (37:06 - 37:14)
staffer States isn&#39;t necessarily limited (37:10 - 37:16)
to Pokemon the article says GameStop the (37:14 - 37:18)
used video game retailer has become (37:16 - 37:22)
increasingly associated with uh multiple (37:18 - 37:25)
Investments they want wants to cash in (37:22 - 37:27)
on the Resurgence of the card collecting (37:25 - 37:28)
craze well I&#39;m going to tell you right (37:27 - 37:30)
now a couple years L they&#39;re a little (37:28 - 37:33)
late they&#39;re a little late here staffers (37:30 - 37:35)
have told Pokey Beach polygon and The (37:33 - 37:38)
Verge that stores will begin buying and (37:35 - 37:40)
selling rare Pokemon cards and possibly (37:38 - 37:43)
other cards as soon as next week this (37:40 - 37:47)
was published on May 10th so literally (37:43 - 37:49)
yesterday GameStop apparently doesn&#39;t (37:47 - 37:51)
want any cards though employees across (37:49 - 37:53)
multiple States say they will only be (37:51 - 37:55)
buying cards that have already been (37:53 - 37:56)
graded by professional sports (37:55 - 37:58)
authenticator PS if you didn&#39;t know what (37:56 - 38:01)
PSA stands for now you do uh they will (37:58 - 38:05)
only buy cards at an 8 n or 10 meaning (38:01 - 38:07)
that they need to be near mint condition (38:05 - 38:09)
or better with only slight imperfections (38:07 - 38:12)
and yet GameStop won&#39;t accept the rarest (38:09 - 38:15)
cards valued at over $500 (38:12 - 38:18)
either uh poke Beach and polygon have (38:15 - 38:20)
been reporting you&#39;ll have to find (38:18 - 38:22)
somewhere else to sell your PSA 10 (38:20 - 38:24)
shadowless first edition Charizard (38:22 - 38:26)
interesting I wonder if this is for (38:24 - 38:28)
Safety and Security issues (38:26 - 38:31)
like maybe but that&#39;s probably a good (38:28 - 38:34)
thing because you know with GameStop if (38:31 - 38:35)
you go in there with something that&#39;s (38:34 - 38:37)
actually worth like $1,000 they&#39;re going (38:35 - 38:41)
to give you like 500 or less four you (38:37 - 38:43)
know like if you if you really did like (38:41 - 38:45)
they&#39;re you we&#39;ve all tried to sell (38:43 - 38:47)
games to GameStop this is going to be no (38:45 - 38:49)
different (38:47 - 38:52)
yeah yeah I wor I worked at a GameStop (38:49 - 38:55)
i&#39; i&#39; I&#39;ve maybe newer people don&#39;t know (38:52 - 38:57)
this it was the worst job I&#39;ve well (38:55 - 38:59)
maybe not not the worst it was one of (38:57 - 39:01)
the worst jobs I&#39;ve ever (38:59 - 39:05)
worked uh I worked there when the Wii (39:01 - 39:05)
came (39:05 - 39:09)
out so every time we answered the phone (39:05 - 39:11)
I specifically said hi thank you for (39:09 - 39:14)
calling GameStop something that you (39:11 - 39:16)
could I would I would I would say hi (39:14 - 39:18)
thank you for calling GameStop just to (39:16 - 39:19)
let you know we don&#39;t have any Weis in (39:18 - 39:22)
stock how may I help you and that was (39:19 - 39:24)
like 90% of the calls where they would (39:22 - 39:26)
go oh never mind thank you bye and (39:24 - 39:29)
perfect great we&#39;ve already answered (39:26 - 39:31)
your question before we got anywhere we (39:29 - 39:33)
don&#39;t have the Wii in stock I know (39:31 - 39:35)
that&#39;s what you&#39;re calling to ask easy (39:33 - 39:37)
the easiest phone call of my life every (39:35 - 39:40)
single time multiple times a (39:37 - 39:42)
day but that was also when the PS3 was (39:40 - 39:45)
out because it was like what PS3 Xbox (39:42 - 39:48)
360 Xbox 360 was a year before them and (39:45 - 39:52)
then the Wii and a lot of the times (39:48 - 39:53)
GameStop would (39:52 - 39:58)
only employ one person (39:53 - 40:00)
GameStop stores are pretty tiny but you (39:58 - 40:02)
would never see like maybe around (40:00 - 40:04)
Christmas you would see like three (40:02 - 40:07)
GameStop employees but like one during (40:04 - 40:11)
the day two maybe in the evening and at (40:07 - 40:13)
the GameStop I worked (40:11 - 40:17)
at we for whatever reason had gotten a (40:13 - 40:20)
shipment of PS3s so I wasn&#39;t working at (40:17 - 40:22)
the time I found out later in my shift (40:20 - 40:24)
when I came in that the one employee (40:22 - 40:28)
working a guy came in he wanted a PS3 (40:24 - 40:29)
put it up on the counter he said do you (40:28 - 40:31)
have any more he said yeah we have one (40:29 - 40:32)
more in back he&#39;s like okay I&#39;ll take (40:31 - 40:36)
both PS3s so the guy went in back to get (40:32 - 40:38)
it and the guy just grabbed the PS3 and (40:36 - 40:41)
ran yeah and that was it sounds about (40:38 - 40:44)
right what do you you can&#39;t CH well you (40:41 - 40:45)
I don&#39;t know why you would want to chase (40:44 - 40:47)
after but even if you wanted to chase (40:45 - 40:49)
after you can&#39;t no one is watching the (40:47 - 40:53)
store at that point it&#39;s only you (40:49 - 40:56)
MH there&#39;s no other it&#39;s not like hey (40:53 - 40:58)
Steve I&#39;m going to chase (40:56 - 41:01)
after I want to protect corporate (40:58 - 41:03)
GameStop and get this P like there&#39;s (41:01 - 41:05)
just no one able to watch the store so (41:03 - 41:06)
in my head when they say they don&#39;t want (41:05 - 41:08)
any cards over (41:06 - 41:12)
$500 it does seem to me like a safety (41:08 - 41:13)
security thing (41:12 - 41:16)
because you have one employee working (41:13 - 41:19)
the majority of the time yeah that&#39;s (41:16 - 41:21)
it&#39;s still that way because I&#39;ve gone to (41:19 - 41:23)
GameStop multiple times over the last (41:21 - 41:26)
couple of years and they they&#39;ve not (41:23 - 41:27)
been open during the middle of the day (41:26 - 41:29)
because the one employee working was (41:27 - 41:31)
like I&#39;m getting lunch so there&#39;s like a (41:29 - 41:33)
will be back sign with like we&#39;ll be (41:31 - 41:36)
back in 20 minutes or whatever and it&#39;s (41:33 - 41:39)
like it&#39;s you know 1:30 in the afternoon (41:36 - 41:40)
but there&#39;s a will be back sign because (41:39 - 41:42)
the one employee needs to be able to you (41:40 - 41:45)
know take a break so they not changed (41:42 - 41:47)
back back in my day you didn&#39;t get a (41:45 - 41:50)
lunch you just work right through yep (41:47 - 41:52)
that&#39;s how that (41:50 - 41:55)
goes uh one employee tells the Verge uh (41:52 - 41:58)
that this is uh expli a explicitly a (41:55 - 42:01)
collaboration between GameStop and PSA (41:58 - 42:03)
so not like a collaboration between the (42:01 - 42:04)
Pokemon company I don&#39;t the Pokemon (42:03 - 42:07)
company not in the PSA business they (42:04 - 42:09)
don&#39;t care this is nothing to do with (42:07 - 42:10)
yeah they&#39;re like we gave we put the (42:09 - 42:12)
cards in the packs like this is whatever (42:10 - 42:14)
you do with them afterwards we don&#39;t (42:12 - 42:16)
want a part (42:14 - 42:19)
of uh but that GameStop won&#39;t offer (42:16 - 42:22)
grading services in store or help you (42:19 - 42:24)
mail in your card for grading GameStop (42:22 - 42:27)
will take other kinds of PSA C graded (42:24 - 42:30)
cards Beyond Pokemon 2 says an employee (42:27 - 42:32)
and while poke Beach reports that you&#39;ll (42:30 - 42:33)
be able to buy cards they won&#39;t (42:32 - 42:36)
necessarily be the same rare PSA graded (42:33 - 42:39)
ones but rather $1 singles to start (42:36 - 42:41)
GameStop did not immediately respond for (42:39 - 42:44)
comment we&#39;ve reached out to PSA it is (42:41 - 42:45)
not clear when this program will roll (42:44 - 42:48)
out but Pokey Beach states that it will (42:45 - 42:51)
start next week uh and local stores in (42:48 - 42:53)
the Pokey Beach area which I think is (42:51 - 42:55)
California said that they will start in (42:53 - 42:57)
July (42:55 - 43:00)
H well I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna try this when (42:57 - 43:02)
it actually does come out I want to (43:00 - 43:06)
see I know that GameStop sells used (43:02 - 43:09)
iPhones and stuff that was not a thing (43:06 - 43:15)
when I worked at GameStop that was after (43:09 - 43:16)
my (43:15 - 43:19)
G I worked at GameStop so long ago we (43:16 - 43:22)
were not selling fun cop Pops at the (43:19 - 43:24)
time I do know now that GameStop is like (43:22 - 43:27)
90% funco pops but that was not a thing (43:24 - 43:31)
when I worked there yep yeah most of (43:27 - 43:33)
GameStop is not games at this point in (43:31 - 43:39)
time that&#39;s so sad I mean it&#39;s a card (43:33 - 43:39)
game I mean but at at the point it&#39;s PSA (43:39 - 43:46)
graded it&#39;s not really a card game any (43:43 - 43:48)
that&#39;s true that is true yeah that&#39;s (43:46 - 43:50)
true it&#39;s a business game well I just (43:48 - 43:52)
think that the fact that the Verge (43:50 - 43:54)
referred to them as the used game seller (43:52 - 43:56)
like they sell new games as well but (43:54 - 43:57)
like the fact that they&#39;re known for (43:56 - 44:01)
selling the used games is is something (43:57 - 44:02)
for GameStop I mean that&#39;s where they (44:01 - 44:04)
make all their their money is the used (44:02 - 44:06)
sure game that&#39;s why they&#39;re offering (44:04 - 44:08)
you know 20 cents for FIFA 14 20 cents (44:06 - 44:10)
might be generous for FIFA 14 yeah the (44:08 - 44:12)
amount of times I&#39;ve walked in there I (44:10 - 44:14)
remember I walked into GameStop one time (44:12 - 44:16)
and I had an Apple TV and I was like (44:14 - 44:19)
will you guys take this and they&#39;re like (44:16 - 44:22)
four bucks and the person standing (44:19 - 44:24)
behind me was like I&#39;ll give you five I (44:22 - 44:29)
was like done you can have it for five (44:24 - 44:30)
it&#39;s great I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing (44:29 - 44:33)
that in a local shop but GameStop (44:30 - 44:36)
Corporation we had to tell people we (44:33 - 44:39)
this happened to me Bobby where I&#39;d be (44:36 - 44:44)
like ah Resident Evil 5 will give you $4 (44:39 - 44:46)
for it and the guy behind them would be (44:44 - 44:48)
like I&#39;ll give you 10 and then I&#39;d be (44:46 - 44:50)
like I would have to say like Take It (44:48 - 44:53)
Outside you can&#39;t this transaction (44:50 - 44:55)
cannot happen in front of me pleasa I (44:53 - 44:58)
don&#39;t care please just do that in the (44:55 - 44:59)
parking lot yep when I when that (44:58 - 45:01)
happened to me I like looked at the (44:59 - 45:04)
employee you know I was like that like (45:01 - 45:07)
can I do this or and they were just like (45:04 - 45:09)
no Bobby they&#39;re they&#39;re calling the (45:07 - 45:11)
cops right now you&#39;re getting arrested (45:09 - 45:13)
can I do this here in front of you or do (45:11 - 45:15)
you want us to you know walk away but he (45:13 - 45:18)
was just like yeah whatever okay I (45:15 - 45:19)
handed me a $5 bill I handed him an (45:18 - 45:22)
Apple TV and I (45:19 - 45:24)
left Bobby I would offered you six you (45:22 - 45:26)
should have called me it&#39;s an old Apple (45:24 - 45:28)
TV (45:26 - 45:31)
you old (45:28 - 45:31)
one I I do think GameStop&#39;s a little bit (45:32 - 45:37)
late here I think they I think they&#39;re I (45:35 - 45:39)
think they&#39;re like three years late on (45:37 - 45:42)
this yeah I mean (45:39 - 45:45)
prices well that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s (45:42 - 45:47)
weird is prices on some of the rare (45:45 - 45:50)
cards that would be I guess maybe not (45:47 - 45:53)
over 500 but there are some cards from (45:50 - 45:55)
the last generation of Pokemon right now (45:53 - 45:58)
that are skyrocketing in value (45:55 - 46:01)
and so I mean I guess they could pick up (45:58 - 46:04)
on on that um but there are some Al the (46:01 - 46:05)
alternate Arts of the sword and shield (46:04 - 46:09)
era are all jumping way up in value (46:05 - 46:11)
right now not all of them but some of (46:09 - 46:12)
the rarer ones are but do you think this (46:11 - 46:15)
is Market (46:12 - 46:15)
[Music] (46:19 - 46:23)
manipulation I mean what the fact that (46:20 - 46:26)
they&#39;re all going up so much right now (46:23 - 46:30)
yeah I I think it&#39;s just that (46:26 - 46:32)
they&#39;re I guess you could call it that (46:30 - 46:34)
they&#39;re less and less they&#39;re just less (46:32 - 46:38)
and less available now you know (46:34 - 46:41)
so I think that that&#39;s just it&#39;s supply (46:38 - 46:44)
and demand in a way yeah I mean I&#39;m look (46:41 - 46:46)
I&#39;m looking at pokemoncenter.com right (46:44 - 46:50)
now which is never never discounted (46:46 - 46:52)
right it&#39;s just this is this is MSRP (46:50 - 46:55)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s like trying to buy Mario (46:52 - 46:59)
Odyssey on the Nintendo ehhop 60 (46:55 - 47:01)
bucks maybe if you&#39;re lucky it&#39;ll go on (46:59 - 47:04)
sale but otherwise back to (47:01 - 47:04)
$60 uh they do have battle Styles in (47:05 - 47:10)
stock 36 packs $143 that&#39;s the normal (47:07 - 47:13)
price that&#39;s what it was when it debuted (47:10 - 47:17)
uh Vivid voltage which was one of the (47:13 - 47:20)
highest in demand sets during covid it (47:17 - 47:23)
was it had the rainbow gigantamax gay (47:20 - 47:24)
Pikachu that everyone wanted it was like (47:23 - 47:27)

now um it is in stock (47:27 - 47:35)
$143 as well 36 packs (47:29 - 47:35)
um those are though chilling rain (47:35 - 47:41)
evolving Skies R evolving Skies is (47:39 - 47:43)
selling for like $1,000 a box right now (47:41 - 47:45)
because of that Umbreon The Umbreon (47:43 - 47:47)
that&#39;s in there The Umbreon itself is (47:45 - 47:51)
selling for $900 not silver tempus is in (47:47 - 47:54)
stock yeah silver Tempest is is lost (47:51 - 47:56)
origin in stock cuz lost origin is going (47:54 - 47:57)
to be the next one cuz there&#39;s a a (47:56 - 47:59)
gutina in there that&#39;s selling for like (47:57 - 48:02)
400 right now on its own when you say (47:59 - 48:05)
selling for 400 is that like that&#39;s PSA (48:02 - 48:07)
graded market price not ungraded (48:05 - 48:09)
ungraded ungraded Ed well I guess I&#39;m (48:07 - 48:11)
going to be selling a gutina soon (48:09 - 48:13)
because I would I would like to you have (48:11 - 48:15)
the alternate art guira from Lost I do I (48:13 - 48:17)
think I have two of them it&#39;s worth (48:15 - 48:19)
about $400 right now maybe higher (48:17 - 48:21)
ungraded I&#39;m not one of those people (48:19 - 48:24)
who&#39;s like taking the PSA 10 value of (48:21 - 48:25)
something and being like this is the (48:24 - 48:27)
price everybody pays for no (48:25 - 48:29)
ungraded uh I&#39;m telling you the (48:27 - 48:32)
alternate Arts are going up in price and (48:29 - 48:33)
it (48:32 - 48:36)
is unfortunate because I don&#39;t have any (48:33 - 48:38)
of them and I&#39;d like them but I got a (48:36 - 48:41)
gutina for you Bobby I&#39;m not paying $400 (48:38 - 48:42)
for that (48:41 - 48:45)
Gua I hear I hear if you have that (48:42 - 48:48)
Umbreon we we could talk a deal I don&#39;t (48:45 - 48:49)
I don&#39;t have the Umbreon I think I have (48:48 - 48:52)
the Leafeon but the Leafeon is not (48:49 - 48:54)
that&#39;s worth like 200 some odd like 250 (48:52 - 48:55)
or something right now they all have (48:54 - 48:58)
jumped up in price a ton those rare ones (48:55 - 49:02)
have all jumped up in price and it is (48:58 - 49:03)
you can call it what you want I mean it (49:02 - 49:05)
is yeah Market manipulation whatever it (49:03 - 49:07)
may be but I think it&#39;s just the fact (49:05 - 49:09)
that the sets are getting a little bit (49:07 - 49:12)
older and people want to jump on those (49:09 - 49:14)
cards I mean to me I&#39;m thinking like (49:12 - 49:17)
who&#39;s paying you know $900 for an (49:14 - 49:19)
Umbreon but then you go look at the (49:17 - 49:21)
sales and they&#39;re happening so people (49:19 - 49:22)
are (49:21 - 49:25)
paying Umbreon never surprises me (49:22 - 49:28)
Umbreon for whatever reason in the T CG (49:25 - 49:31)
is on this like the tier below Charizard (49:28 - 49:34)
right mhm right and I&#39;m actually (49:31 - 49:38)
surprised Greninja isn&#39;t that tier like (49:34 - 49:40)
I&#39;m sure Greninja will get there there (49:38 - 49:44)
has been a Greninja card until this set (49:40 - 49:45)
coming up twilight masquerade is the (49:44 - 49:48)
first one where there&#39;s like a rare (49:45 - 49:50)
special illustration type like there was (49:48 - 49:52)
no alt-art Greninja in the sword and (49:50 - 49:54)
shield era or even in this there was (49:52 - 49:55)
radiant (49:54 - 49:58)
Greninja and that well I think that was (49:55 - 50:00)
pretty playable so that one actually (49:58 - 50:04)
well yeah uh but yeah I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll (50:00 - 50:05)
see now cuz there&#39;s a special (50:04 - 50:06)
illustration Greninja in the next set (50:05 - 50:08)
and you know it would be interesting to (50:06 - 50:13)
see but that Umbreon is like the outlier (50:08 - 50:17)
of these cards I I have seen it for as (50:13 - 50:20)
low as as low as $250 and I will never (50:17 - 50:23)
forget this ever because my friend took (50:20 - 50:26)
a picture of it said it&#39;s only 250 and (50:23 - 50:27)
this was like two years ago do you want (50:26 - 50:29)
to venmo me jokingly said you want to (50:27 - 50:32)
venmo me I&#39;ll send it to you and I (50:29 - 50:35)
said I kind of do but you know what I&#39;m (50:32 - 50:36)
going to wait for it to come down (50:35 - 50:38)
because of course it&#39;ll come down and it (50:36 - 50:41)
is now sitting at $1,000 and I&#39;m just (50:38 - 50:44)
kicking myself that card is like the one (50:41 - 50:46)
exception it&#39;s the outlier right it&#39;s (50:44 - 50:48)
the one it&#39;s the one of course that like (50:46 - 50:50)
just never came down because even going (50:48 - 50:52)
back to the Vivid voltage Pikachu (50:50 - 50:53)
everyone was like this card is going to (50:52 - 50:56)
go up up up up and it it it did for a (50:53 - 51:00)
while but now it it&#39;s it&#39;s like 125 yep (50:56 - 51:02)
ungraded I I speak also in ungraded (51:00 - 51:04)
terms here (51:02 - 51:08)
yeah yeah so I don&#39;t know I I still (51:04 - 51:11)
think that uh Pokemon does go in waves (51:08 - 51:12)
and (51:11 - 51:15)
So eventually I think that some prices (51:12 - 51:17)
on these will come back down a little (51:15 - 51:20)
bit maybe go back up a little bit but (51:17 - 51:21)
right now the sword and shield alterate (51:20 - 51:24)
Arts are having a moment so there there (51:21 - 51:28)
is part of me so when I there there was (51:24 - 51:30)
a certain point where I was completely (51:28 - 51:34)
broke poor living paycheck to paycheck (51:30 - 51:36)
this is probably relatable to a lot of (51:34 - 51:38)
people in the United States (51:36 - 51:42)
currently and I had way too many hobbies (51:38 - 51:45)
I I I was I was in Skylanders at the (51:42 - 51:49)
time I was still into like buying Hannah (51:45 - 51:51)
for the audio people Hannah is shaking (51:49 - 51:53)
her head and laughing at me I was the (51:51 - 51:56)
toys to life I was I was Hardcore into I (51:53 - 51:59)
need did every Skylander possible I was (51:56 - 52:00)
in the Pokemon Trading Card Game stuff (51:59 - 52:02)
and I was playing competitively at the (52:00 - 52:05)
time um I was still buying physical (52:02 - 52:06)
versions of video games and I was like (52:05 - 52:07)
one of those people that were like I (52:06 - 52:09)
want a wall of physical video games (52:07 - 52:13)
forever um I was still into collecting (52:09 - 52:14)
Blu-rays at the time you could tell this (52:13 - 52:16)
was a long time ago I was still into (52:14 - 52:17)
collecting Blu-rays and like all the (52:16 - 52:19)
movies I liked guys I literally (52:17 - 52:21)
mentioned Skylanders so yes you could (52:19 - 52:24)
tell this is a long time ago yes um and (52:21 - 52:27)
I was I was just I was just broke broke (52:24 - 52:29)
and that was the point where I was like (52:27 - 52:30)
I wasn&#39;t happy with the TCG I wasn&#39;t (52:29 - 52:33)
happy it was around the time like plasma (52:30 - 52:35)
storm or Plasma Blast or whatever (52:33 - 52:38)
whatever set introduced hypnotoxic laser (52:35 - 52:40)
and I ended up selling all my Skylanders (52:38 - 52:41)
I I think I made like 800 bucks off (52:40 - 52:44)
Skylanders I sold before the the the B (52:41 - 52:46)
the Boom the burst the burst I sold (52:44 - 52:48)
before the bubble (52:46 - 52:51)
popped and then I sold a lot of my TCG (52:48 - 52:52)
cards and I had like two tropical (52:51 - 52:54)
beaches and I sold each of those for (52:52 - 52:56)
$200 then I sold a bunch of cards oh I (52:54 - 52:58)
was also into board games at the time so (52:56 - 53:01)
I was buying board games nonstop jez so (52:58 - 53:04)
many hobbies yeah so many hobbies money (53:01 - 53:07)
like giving Hobbies yeah yeah I don&#39;t (53:04 - 53:09)
understand how people can be like I&#39;m (53:07 - 53:12)
I&#39;m my hobby is is skiing but also 800 (53:09 - 53:14)
other things like skiing alone is a very (53:12 - 53:17)
expensive hobby yes um yes it is I (53:14 - 53:18)
brought that up because I have a friend (53:17 - 53:20)
who skis and I&#39;m like I have no clue how (53:18 - 53:22)
you afford this hobby um it&#39;s a rich (53:20 - 53:24)
person hobby it is definitely a rich (53:22 - 53:27)
person hobby uh so and then I sold all (53:24 - 53:29)
my cards almost all my cards and I ended (53:27 - 53:31)
up walking away with like over $1,000 (53:29 - 53:33)
not including the two tropical beaches I (53:31 - 53:35)
sold and I actually used all that money (53:33 - 53:37)
and I paid off a credit card and that (53:35 - 53:39)
was me starting to like get out of debt (53:37 - 53:41)
because I was living paycheck to (53:39 - 53:43)
paycheck and there was part of me after (53:41 - 53:45)
I sold all those cards I also sold my (53:43 - 53:50)
like 3DS Pikachu thing I don&#39;t know (53:45 - 53:52)
which there those multiple 3DS Pikachu (53:50 - 53:53)
but I sold one of those and there&#39;s like (53:52 - 53:54)
part of me that like kind of regrets (53:53 - 53:57)
like I wish I had all those cards or or (53:54 - 53:59)
I I still wish I had that 3DS I don&#39;t (53:57 - 54:00)
wish I had the Skylanders very glad I (53:59 - 54:02)
sold those (54:00 - 54:07)
um but now like I I I I booked this I (54:02 - 54:09)
booked my trip to Japan and I booked my (54:07 - 54:11)
trip to Spain and I&#39;m like booking two (54:09 - 54:13)
International trips on the same week is (54:11 - 54:14)
a nightmare (54:13 - 54:16)
financially (54:14 - 54:18)
like but I do have stuff because I my (54:16 - 54:22)
basement flooded and I luckily nothing (54:18 - 54:26)
was damaged except one bookshelf but the (54:22 - 54:28)
the contractor who came down right away (54:26 - 54:30)
he was like man you have a lot of (54:28 - 54:34)
Pokemon stuff and I was like I sure do (54:30 - 54:36)
haven&#39;t seen anything he flagged that (54:34 - 54:38)
instantly when he walked into that (54:36 - 54:40)
basement and I was like yeah all of (54:38 - 54:43)
these totes which all my Pokemon stuff (54:40 - 54:45)
are in totes um we&#39;re we&#39;re safe from (54:43 - 54:48)
water damage because they&#39;re really big (54:45 - 54:50)
plastic industrial (54:48 - 54:54)
totes and I&#39;m thinking to myself I kind (54:50 - 54:57)
of want to sell again I just have so (54:54 - 54:59)
many cards and they&#39;ve literally been in (54:57 - 55:03)
totes for two years since I moved here (54:59 - 55:05)
and there was a point in between of me (55:03 - 55:06)
selling the first time and then me being (55:05 - 55:08)
like ah I kind of wish I didn&#39;t sell and (55:06 - 55:10)
now there&#39;s like a point where like what (55:08 - 55:13)
am I holding on to I will never finish (55:10 - 55:15)
these sets I will never get that Umbreon (55:13 - 55:19)
I will never get the Espeon I will like (55:15 - 55:21)
all of these Eevees are too expensive (55:19 - 55:24)
I&#39;m missing Charizards or other cards (55:21 - 55:28)
that are super expensive what if I just (55:24 - 55:28)
sold yeah depends on the kind of (55:29 - 55:34)
collector you are right I mean yeah (55:32 - 55:36)
that&#39;s a lot of people like I think I&#39;m (55:34 - 55:38)
a collector where it&#39;s like I just want (55:36 - 55:39)
I just want to collect crar ANS I just (55:38 - 55:42)
want to collect cards that I really like (55:39 - 55:46)
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really possible (55:42 - 55:50)
to collect these Master sets of just (55:46 - 55:53)
every card every secret rare every (55:50 - 55:57)
rainbow rare every super secret rare or (55:53 - 56:00)
whatever they&#39;re called (55:57 - 56:02)
now well you you&#39;re friends with uh you (56:00 - 56:04)
know Danny Phantom right yeah yeah (56:02 - 56:07)
Danny&#39;s Great that he Master sets (56:04 - 56:10)
everything but he also tells people how (56:07 - 56:12)
much it costs to do so and you know (56:10 - 56:14)
everything that it costs and I mean (56:12 - 56:15)
we&#39;re (56:14 - 56:19)
talking 5,000 a set you know 3 to 5,000 (56:15 - 56:22)
a set like for from my perspective it&#39;s (56:19 - 56:22)
not (56:22 - 56:25)
like I want to collect all of these (56:22 - 56:27)
cards because one one day they will be (56:25 - 56:29)
worth money like that was the dream I (56:27 - 56:32)
was sold as a 10-year-old right like you (56:29 - 56:33)
got to get you got to get the complete (56:32 - 56:35)
set of fossil you got to compl get the (56:33 - 56:36)
SE complete set of jungle and this will (56:35 - 56:38)
pay for your college and maybe if you (56:36 - 56:41)
sold at the exact right time and you had (56:38 - 56:43)
all of this stuff and you found the (56:41 - 56:44)
right buyer it did maybe pay for some (56:43 - 56:46)
people&#39;s colleges but I we always make (56:44 - 56:49)
the joke about ancient Mew of like I had (56:46 - 56:52)
20 ancient Mew still in its rapper and (56:49 - 56:54)
my my parents were like this this is (56:52 - 56:55)
going to pay for your college Ancient M (56:54 - 56:57)
is like a $22 card maybe if it&#39;s like (56:55 - 57:00)
PSA 10 it&#39;s more but like Steve I (56:57 - 57:02)
currently have all of B set I think you (57:00 - 57:06)
probably do too it&#39;s not right now if I (57:02 - 57:08)
said it&#39;s not paying for anyone&#39;s (57:06 - 57:11)
College maybe part way but I don&#39;t even (57:08 - 57:13)
know where my I have all of B set I have (57:11 - 57:15)
all of fossil I have all of jungle I (57:13 - 57:16)
have almost all of I think Team Rocket (57:15 - 57:19)
was the fourth set mhm no clue where (57:16 - 57:21)
they are one in one of those totes in (57:19 - 57:22)
the basement I&#39;m sure right right right (57:21 - 57:24)
and for regional dialect totes are (57:22 - 57:27)
plastic bins they&#39;re not tote bag (57:24 - 57:29)
just not tote bags (57:27 - 57:34)
yes yeah no clue where they are I think (57:29 - 57:35)
everybody has their own way of (57:34 - 57:37)
collecting their own reasons to collect (57:35 - 57:41)
but uh it is expensive Pokemon cards are (57:37 - 57:43)
expensive all cards are expensive sports (57:41 - 57:45)
cards are I before Pokemon cards when I (57:43 - 57:48)
was a kid I collected basketball cards (57:45 - 57:50)
just as expensive and nowadays like more (57:48 - 57:51)
expensive because there&#39;s so many more (57:50 - 57:53)
there&#39;s such a variety of sports cards (57:51 - 57:58)
to collect but it&#39;s you know if you want (57:53 - 58:01)
to if you&#39;re collecting to try to make (57:58 - 58:04)
money it&#39;s very different than if you&#39;re (58:01 - 58:06)
collecting just to collect I mean the (58:04 - 58:09)
you have to the whole thought process of (58:06 - 58:11)
how you&#39;re doing it has to be different (58:09 - 58:12)
like for one collecting by just opening (58:11 - 58:15)
a bunch of packs you&#39;re never going to (58:12 - 58:17)
win that&#39;s not a money-making way to do (58:15 - 58:19)
it people think that they can go in and (58:17 - 58:21)
buy cases of booster boxes and then (58:19 - 58:22)
that&#39;s gonna that&#39;s just not how it (58:21 - 58:25)
works unless you are an actual card shop (58:22 - 58:27)
or like a reseller (58:25 - 58:29)
otherwise that&#39;s just not the way to do (58:27 - 58:32)
it you but if you&#39;re collecting to (58:29 - 58:34)
collect you know I mean I don&#39;t know (58:32 - 58:36)
about you Steve you have a bunch of clo (58:34 - 58:38)
like sealed up stuff so I have a lot of (58:36 - 58:41)
sealed stuff yeah yeah I mean if but I (58:38 - 58:44)
was I was reached out to by whatnot and (58:41 - 58:45)
they were like you want to do a stream (58:44 - 58:49)
for us and I was like maybe like I&#39;m not (58:45 - 58:52)
the biggest fan of like whatnot but the (58:49 - 58:54)
the the rep I was talking to was like (58:52 - 58:56)
really nice and I was like if I&#39;m going (58:54 - 58:59)
to do a for you like could we do it for (58:56 - 59:02)
charity that would be cool like people (58:59 - 59:04)
buy a booster pack for me mhm the money (59:02 - 59:06)
goes to charity I don&#39;t know take your (59:04 - 59:08)
like $2 processing fee or whatever but (59:06 - 59:10)
you&#39;ve done that before I&#39;ve done that (59:08 - 59:12)
before yeah yeah we never ended up (59:10 - 59:14)
working out a deal which is totally fine (59:12 - 59:16)
but like they were like do you have old (59:14 - 59:20)
stuff and I was like boy do (59:16 - 59:20)
I you better believe I (59:21 - 59:27)
do in fact it&#39;s in my kitchen right now (59:24 - 59:30)
cuz my basement (59:27 - 59:30)
flooded um yeah I have a lot of old (59:31 - 59:37)
stuff and part of me is like what if I (59:35 - 59:39)
just sold that (59:37 - 59:42)
too like I (59:39 - 59:45)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to be the (59:42 - 59:47)
person that&#39;s like I&#39;m holding on to (59:45 - 59:49)
this forever cuz one day it might be (59:47 - 59:51)
worth double or triple like sure one day (59:49 - 59:53)
maybe it will be but (59:51 - 59:56)
like I want to live my life now hold on (59:53 - 59:58)
to things because you want to have them (59:56 - 60:01)
that&#39;s I I always feel like that&#39;s (59:58 - 60:03)
the the (60:01 - 60:06)
key that is the the best way to go about (60:03 - 60:09)
it I I think I for me as well that as (60:06 - 60:10)
someone who collects a bunch of Pokemon (60:09 - 60:12)
cards but I have that same thought (60:10 - 60:16)
processes as Steve too I think like what (60:12 - 60:18)
part of this (60:16 - 60:21)
is the feeling you get of like ripping (60:18 - 60:23)
open a pack of cards and maybe getting (60:21 - 60:26)
that like rare one and what part of it (60:23 - 60:29)
is is actually like oh I really want to (60:26 - 60:31)
keep and want to like want these cards (60:29 - 60:33)
right like there are certain cards I (60:31 - 60:34)
want there are certain cards I don&#39;t (60:33 - 60:37)
care about and yet like I could just go (60:34 - 60:39)
buy those cards right or you know but (60:37 - 60:41)
you spend all this time opening packs (60:39 - 60:44)
and it comes down to like well what part (60:41 - 60:47)
of that is what I like the most is it (60:44 - 60:48)
just that I like to open packs is it (60:47 - 60:49)
like that I like the actual cards you (60:48 - 60:51)
know and you kind of if you actually sit (60:49 - 60:53)
back and think about that that really (60:51 - 60:56)
changes what you&#39;re doing when you comes (60:53 - 60:57)
to like these car like I don&#39;t open as (60:56 - 61:00)
many packs as I used to because I sort (60:57 - 61:03)
of came to the realization of well I if (61:00 - 61:05)
I like these cards and I just like these (61:03 - 61:08)
specific cards could probably spend as (61:05 - 61:09)
much money to just buy the specific (61:08 - 61:11)
cards as I do to open all these packs (61:09 - 61:14)
and not pull the specific cards you know (61:11 - 61:15)
and I mean that&#39;s been the that&#39;s the (61:14 - 61:17)
age-old like thing with with uh trading (61:15 - 61:20)
cards right people who play the game (61:17 - 61:22)
like play the game competitively a lot (61:20 - 61:23)
right they don&#39;t they don&#39;t buy a bunch (61:22 - 61:25)
of packs they&#39;ll go buy the singles of (61:23 - 61:27)
the cards that they need because at the (61:25 - 61:30)
end of the day it&#39;s much cheaper that&#39;s (61:27 - 61:32)
the easiest way to do it and it&#39;s the (61:30 - 61:34)
easy way to just get what you need to (61:32 - 61:37)
yeah to play the game you know and cards (61:34 - 61:39)
like it is much cheaper but it&#39;s also (61:37 - 61:41)
still expensive I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve (61:39 - 61:44)
mentioned here before that I I&#39;ve never (61:41 - 61:47)
really played TCG because it&#39;s just (61:44 - 61:49)
always been too expensive I get Pokemon (61:47 - 61:51)
cards for Christmas and that&#39;s the (61:49 - 61:56)
extent of it for the most part but I had (61:51 - 61:59)
uh I had a friend visit in January he (61:56 - 62:02)
stayed a couple days and um he was like (61:59 - 62:04)
oh my my nephews are really into Pokemon (62:02 - 62:06)
they have decks and stuff and he&#39;s like (62:04 - 62:07)
I want to build like a a real deck and I (62:06 - 62:09)
want to like I want to beat them and I (62:07 - 62:11)
was like yeah cool we can we can beat (62:09 - 62:14)
your nephews like that&#39;s prettyy easy um (62:11 - 62:17)
and he probably ended up he was like (62:14 - 62:18)
well I want to buy some cards just to (62:17 - 62:20)
open packs but I also want to like build (62:18 - 62:22)
a deck and he must have spent probably (62:20 - 62:25)
$100 that weekend on just cards and he (62:22 - 62:27)
opened the up and he was like is this (62:25 - 62:28)
good I was like no none of these are (62:27 - 62:30)
good and I was like well what kind of I (62:28 - 62:31)
was like what kind of deck you want to (62:30 - 62:33)
build and we we found a deck and he (62:31 - 62:35)
maybe had like three out of like the 60 (62:33 - 62:36)
cards in the deck he probably pulled (62:35 - 62:39)
like five of the 60 cards needed and I (62:36 - 62:40)
was (62:39 - 62:42)
like let me go into my let me go into (62:40 - 62:44)
this room okay here&#39;s a bunch of cards (62:42 - 62:46)
okay we&#39;re going to go through each card (62:44 - 62:49)
okay here&#39;s the Here&#39;s the the the the (62:46 - 62:53)
the B Barrel you need here&#39;s the here&#39;s (62:49 - 62:55)
the Charmander you need here&#39;s the item (62:53 - 62:57)
card you need and still after all of (62:55 - 63:01)
that after all of these cards of that I (62:57 - 63:03)
own um he was still missing like 20 (63:01 - 63:04)
cards and I was like okay here&#39;s the (63:03 - 63:06)
card list of what you&#39;re missing you&#39;ll (63:04 - 63:08)
have to probably go to TCG play or Ebay (63:06 - 63:11)
he spent like another 40 or 50 on the (63:08 - 63:13)
last 20 cards he needed now that&#39;s not (63:11 - 63:15)
to say like every deck is like 150 plus (63:13 - 63:17)
like you can go to TCG player right now (63:15 - 63:19)
and probably get a deck for like $25 is (63:17 - 63:21)
it like an S tier deck no it&#39;s probably (63:19 - 63:23)
like a b tier deck but (63:21 - 63:26)
like you can get a deck for really cheap (63:23 - 63:28)
is not going to be but also like getting (63:26 - 63:29)
an Esther deck doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re (63:28 - 63:31)
automatically going to win you have to (63:29 - 63:32)
like still be good at the game multiple (63:31 - 63:36)
factors yeah right it&#39;s not like going (63:32 - 63:38)
to like Dick Sporting Goods and getting (63:36 - 63:40)
like a $300 tennis racket and you&#39;re (63:38 - 63:42)
like oh I&#39;m good at (63:40 - 63:44)
tennis that&#39;s all I (63:42 - 63:46)
[Laughter] (63:44 - 63:49)
needed just needed the good (63:46 - 63:52)
racket uh all right let&#39;s take one more (63:49 - 63:55)
break we&#39;ll wrap up with some scarlet (63:52 - 63:57)
and violent news and whatever else was (63:55 - 63:58)
on our to-do list so we will be right (63:57 - 64:03)
back and we are back from our break I (63:58 - 64:04)
don&#39;t know why I wasn&#39;t confident in (64:03 - 64:06)
that uh (64:04 - 64:09)
we we have a little bit of Pokemon go (64:06 - 64:11)
news and then the primarina raids are (64:09 - 64:15)
here uh this is off pokemongolive.com (64:11 - 64:17)
celebrate Latin America Spanish language (64:15 - 64:19)
support coming to Pokemon go with a (64:17 - 64:20)
special (64:19 - 64:23)
event (64:20 - 64:23)
uh is Latin America Spanish different (64:23 - 64:30)
than yes other oh it is okay okay it is (64:26 - 64:33)
different yep got (64:30 - 64:36)
it glad that (64:33 - 64:38)
was that was probably a dumb question (64:36 - 64:40)
but you know I no it&#39;s not lots of (64:38 - 64:42)
people don&#39;t know it but yeah they are (64:40 - 64:44)
they are different enough that they are (64:42 - 64:46)
taught separately usually if you&#39;re (64:44 - 64:48)
taking a Spanish class you usually know (64:46 - 64:49)
which one you&#39;re (64:48 - 64:51)
learning is it just called Latin America (64:49 - 64:54)
Spanish Latin American Spanish I think (64:51 - 64:57)
so (64:54 - 64:59)
I&#39;m not 100% certain yeah I don&#39;t know (64:57 - 65:01)
the answer to that I&#39;m not gonna say (64:59 - 65:03)
anything because 100% sure I would (65:01 - 65:05)
assume that&#39;s correct because it says (65:03 - 65:06)
starting today you&#39;ll be able to set (65:05 - 65:08)
your in-game language to Latin americ (65:06 - 65:12)

chance of daily surprises when you (66:26 - 66:32)
encounter Pokemon with the go (66:29 - 66:36)
snapshot it looks like this event is (66:32 - 66:37)
nearly identical to the one when they (66:36 - 66:40)
added Hindi language support in India (66:37 - 66:43)
last year oh cool (66:40 - 66:47)
nice um speaking of the go snapshot they (66:43 - 66:51)
did oh good transition they did uh (66:47 - 66:54)
update the camera finally it&#39;s out for (66:51 - 66:57)
everyone uh Bobby you&#39;ve taken pictures (66:54 - 67:01)
with said camera I have it&#39;s a it&#39;s a (66:57 - 67:04)
very good update I I will say it&#39;s been (67:01 - 67:06)
uh I haven&#39;t seen any issues with it (67:04 - 67:09)
personally uh there there hasn&#39;t been (67:06 - 67:11)
any so (67:09 - 67:15)
before they came out with this last year (67:11 - 67:18)
they removed a feature that was called (67:15 - 67:21)
like group AR mode where you could get (67:18 - 67:24)
together with two or three people you (67:21 - 67:26)
could all have your buddy Pokemon and (67:24 - 67:27)
then send them out and then you could (67:26 - 67:29)
take a picture of two or three Pokémon (67:27 - 67:34)
together and that crashed like every (67:29 - 67:38)
other time you tried to use it and this (67:34 - 67:40)
isn&#39;t along the same lines because for (67:38 - 67:42)
one you&#39;re just using one device which (67:40 - 67:44)
is great uh two you&#39;re not using your (67:42 - 67:46)
buddy Pokemon this time around you&#39;re (67:44 - 67:48)
actually using the goh snapshot where (67:46 - 67:50)
you you know you actually pick a Pokemon (67:48 - 67:54)
from your storage and can do that uh but (67:50 - 67:57)
it has been totally smooth on the roll (67:54 - 68:01)
out so another win for Niantic update (67:57 - 68:04)
that seemingly is is positive and people (68:01 - 68:06)
aren&#39;t really mad about it that (68:04 - 68:08)
obviously it&#39;s hitting a much smaller (68:06 - 68:10)
group that is using it yeah people (68:08 - 68:11)
aren&#39;t really mad about it I think lots (68:10 - 68:15)
of people don&#39;t use it or know yeah (68:11 - 68:18)
really yeah know what to do with it but (68:15 - 68:22)
it is fun to be able to take pictures of (68:18 - 68:23)
multiple Pokemon at (68:22 - 68:26)
once um (68:23 - 68:27)
kind of surprised they didn&#39;t do (68:26 - 68:30)
anything around like an event or like (68:27 - 68:33)
something to I think they did um if you (68:30 - 68:34)
use ghost snapshot and I don&#39;t know if (68:33 - 68:36)
it&#39;s still available you could go and (68:34 - 68:41)
get uh some Flare from the shop for free (68:36 - 68:43)
because with this new update you can (68:41 - 68:46)
actually add stickers to your (68:43 - 68:49)
pictures and they the stickers that you (68:46 - 68:51)
get from gifts the stickers that you can (68:49 - 68:53)
send to people those same stickers (68:51 - 68:58)
however it does consume the sticker so (68:53 - 69:00)
if you have 25 of those Bulbasaur (68:58 - 69:02)
stickers that you would send on a gift (69:00 - 69:04)
to somebody you can out put them on you (69:02 - 69:06)
can now put them on your picture when (69:04 - 69:08)
you&#39;ve taken a picture but it takes it (69:06 - 69:10)
out of your storage they&#39;re trying to (69:08 - 69:12)
sell more stickers yeah so just know (69:10 - 69:14)
that if you have if you&#39;re I did this (69:12 - 69:16)
for a little while where I tried to keep (69:14 - 69:19)
one of every single sticker so I would (69:16 - 69:21)
have a collection of all the old ones um (69:19 - 69:24)
I gave up on that after some time but if (69:21 - 69:25)
you&#39;ve been doing that and you have (69:24 - 69:28)
stickers used don&#39;t want to lose don&#39;t (69:25 - 69:30)
put them on a photo yeah don&#39;t put them (69:28 - 69:32)
on a photo because they do consume the (69:30 - 69:35)
sticker uh but it and I have seen people (69:32 - 69:38)
saying it&#39;s kind of cool where if you (69:35 - 69:40)
have if you do have stickers you want to (69:38 - 69:42)
use uh let&#39;s say you&#39;re at a specific (69:40 - 69:45)
Pokemon event like go Fest and you get a (69:42 - 69:47)
special go Fest sticker you could put (69:45 - 69:49)
that on a picture right and it kind of (69:47 - 69:51)
is a little bit more like oh you could (69:49 - 69:52)
remember this is like this picture is (69:51 - 69:54)
from go Fest or you know you could do it (69:52 - 69:57)
in that way as well if you don&#39;t mind (69:54 - 69:58)
losing it but you will you know you (69:57 - 70:00)
won&#39;t be able to have that sticker after (69:58 - 70:05)
that so it does consume them there was a (70:00 - 70:08)
point where (70:05 - 70:11)
the this is like maybe seven years ago (70:08 - 70:13)
where when you took a picture it took (70:11 - 70:15)
like a really good picture and then (70:13 - 70:17)
Niantic changed it where the picture (70:15 - 70:20)
wasn&#39;t as high quality I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been (70:17 - 70:21)
wanting to ask about that too because (70:20 - 70:23)
they haven&#39;t changed that right is that (70:21 - 70:26)
the same here it&#39;s the same it it takes (70:23 - 70:29)
the the quality of picture is I believe (70:26 - 70:30)
the way that it works is it&#39;s almost (70:29 - 70:34)
like it&#39;s a screenshot yeah it&#39;s kind of (70:30 - 70:36)
too yeah yeah Snapchat and Instagram (70:34 - 70:37)
they take screenshots they don&#39;t (70:36 - 70:39)
actually use the well I mean they&#39;re (70:37 - 70:41)
using the camera but they&#39;re like the (70:39 - 70:42)
picture isn&#39;t processed to the same way (70:41 - 70:44)
like a the camera processes a picture (70:42 - 70:46)
when you&#39;re in like the camera app or a (70:44 - 70:48)
different app yeah so the pictures are (70:46 - 70:52)
not it&#39;s the same quality as before so (70:48 - 70:54)
that&#39;s a bummer it is a bummer because (70:52 - 70:56)
that would be the biggest Improvement is (70:54 - 70:59)
just to make the quality of the actual (70:56 - 71:04)
pictures better but that has not changed (70:59 - 71:07)
and I don&#39;t there were other n games (71:04 - 71:10)
that I think used the camera better I&#39;m (71:07 - 71:13)
pretty sure I heard newer games had used (71:10 - 71:15)
the camera in a more native way I (71:13 - 71:18)
believe uh the Pikmin game does Pikmin (71:15 - 71:20)
Bloom I believe you take pictures of (71:18 - 71:23)
that it&#39;s a better quality picture than (71:20 - 71:28)
what Pokémon go um puts out P bom also (71:23 - 71:30)
accesses your entire camera roll and (71:28 - 71:32)
picks photos from it do but that&#39;s (71:30 - 71:34)
different that&#39;s I know that is (71:32 - 71:36)
different but that is weird I do like (71:34 - 71:38)
Pikmin Bloom I stopped playing it but I (71:36 - 71:42)
did enjoy that game yeah so yeah that (71:38 - 71:45)
they hopefully one day that will change (71:42 - 71:47)
I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re if it wasn&#39;t (71:45 - 71:51)
in this update I have no (71:47 - 71:54)
hope I don&#39;t know I mean but so anyway (71:51 - 71:56)
the update does have some other good (71:54 - 71:58)
things though like um if you did take (71:56 - 72:00)
pictures before uh with flying Pokemon (71:58 - 72:02)
you can now actually change which height (72:00 - 72:04)
they&#39;re at so you can you know make them (72:02 - 72:06)
higher or lower in the picture yeah um (72:04 - 72:08)
you can turn the Pokemon around much (72:06 - 72:11)
easier to rotate them you don&#39;t have to (72:08 - 72:12)
walk around the Pokemon to get it to (72:11 - 72:14)
look a different direction you can now (72:12 - 72:15)
just rotate the Pokemon to look a (72:14 - 72:18)
different direction um you can get them (72:15 - 72:21)
to all smile at the same time to you (72:18 - 72:23)
know do their celebration animation at (72:21 - 72:26)
the same time and there&#39;s also a timer (72:23 - 72:28)
you can set a 5sec or a 10-second timer (72:26 - 72:32)
now for your pictures and so that&#39;s so (72:28 - 72:34)
you can set the timer go run out in (72:32 - 72:36)
front of your camera and take a photo of (72:34 - 72:39)
yourself with your Pokemon yep exactly (72:36 - 72:41)
so you got 5 seconds or 10 seconds uh (72:39 - 72:43)
and then they&#39;re trying to improve on (72:41 - 72:46)
the reality blending which was the the (72:43 - 72:48)
feature that they came out with a couple (72:46 - 72:49)
years ago well maybe maybe more than a (72:48 - 72:52)
couple years ago where like if there was (72:49 - 72:54)
like a tree and you wanted the Pokemon (72:52 - 72:56)
to be like popping out from be beside (72:54 - 72:59)
the tree it would try to blend that so (72:56 - 73:01)
that the Pokemon would it would actually (72:59 - 73:04)
disappear behind the tree uh that was (73:01 - 73:07)
only ever available in portrait mode (73:04 - 73:09)
before and now it is available in (73:07 - 73:12)
portrait or landscape mode I have not (73:09 - 73:14)
tried it to see how if it has improved (73:12 - 73:17)
much uh I do know there&#39;s a fair amount (73:14 - 73:21)
of um uh Japanese players who do the goh (73:17 - 73:24)
snapshot stuff and post a lot of it on X (73:21 - 73:27)
and Instagram and threads we call they (73:24 - 73:30)
seem to use that a lot more what we call (73:27 - 73:31)
it Twitter (73:30 - 73:35)
here okay I mean sure I don&#39;t even use (73:31 - 73:37)
it anymore so I have no idea but uh so (73:35 - 73:41)
Twitter and Instagram and threads (73:37 - 73:44)
uh then uh they use that reality (73:41 - 73:46)
blending a lot more there are a lot of (73:44 - 73:51)
very creative go snapshot posts tweets (73:46 - 73:55)
things like that uh so if you are want (73:51 - 73:57)
to look up and see some some pretty cool (73:55 - 74:00)
pictures just like look up # go snapshot (73:57 - 74:03)
or goost snapshot like in in Threads or (74:00 - 74:05)
Instagram and there are a lot of very (74:03 - 74:09)
creative people uh and there&#39;s a lot of (74:05 - 74:12)
people in specifically in Japan because (74:09 - 74:15)
they have the they do the um the lids or (74:12 - 74:18)
the the the Poke the Poke lids and (74:15 - 74:20)
they&#39;ll take a lot of pictures with (74:18 - 74:23)
themed around those Lids which is uh (74:20 - 74:25)
pretty cool so uh but yeah the new ghost (74:23 - 74:28)
go snapshot updates I think are an (74:25 - 74:31)
overall win uh they (74:28 - 74:34)
just that camera quality like I just if (74:31 - 74:36)
they could ever do it I mean that&#39;s why (74:34 - 74:38)
like my pictures it&#39;s like I like (74:36 - 74:40)
looking about them my phone but the (74:38 - 74:41)
moment I have to look at them on my (74:40 - 74:44)
computer or something it&#39;s like oh yeah (74:41 - 74:48)
this isn&#39;t good like these aren&#39;t great (74:44 - 74:50)
it really shows in places with a lot of (74:48 - 74:52)
foliage or a lot of busyness in the (74:50 - 74:55)
photo it just means that if if you live (74:52 - 74:57)
in a place with a lot of forests it&#39;s (74:55 - 74:59)
really hard to take good go snapshots (74:57 - 75:01)
yeah not helpful for you me over here (74:59 - 75:05)
with the desert and the water is more (75:01 - 75:05)
okay uh speaking of water actually (75:07 - 75:12)
before we talk about primarina that was (75:11 - 75:15)
also a good transition uh nitic did this (75:12 - 75:17)
weird thing it&#39;s not weird it definitely (75:15 - 75:20)
intentional they put the the the Poke (75:17 - 75:23)
coin boxes at the top of the store and (75:20 - 75:26)
it was up there for like two weeks (75:23 - 75:28)
and I did personally message them and I (75:26 - 75:30)
was like this (75:28 - 75:30)
sucks it it did it did like I I do go (75:33 - 75:39)
into the store I like to see personally (75:37 - 75:41)
I like to see what are the current (75:39 - 75:43)
events because it&#39;s like those are the (75:41 - 75:46)
spend the dollar or whatever but like it (75:43 - 75:47)
does remind you of like what events are (75:46 - 75:50)
coming up and then below that was the (75:47 - 75:52)
free box and then at the very bottom was (75:50 - 75:54)
the the the very very bottom was the the (75:52 - 75:57)
store they flipped it it was around for (75:54 - 75:59)
like two weeks I&#39;m not I don&#39;t think my (75:57 - 76:01)
message to them saying it sucked was the (75:59 - 76:02)
the (76:01 - 76:06)
convincing thing um but uh they switched (76:02 - 76:09)
it back as far as I know it&#39;s not at the (76:06 - 76:11)
top of my store anymore it&#39;s back to (76:09 - 76:15)
normal whatever normal is yeah I didn&#39;t (76:11 - 76:17)
actually notice it till you just like (76:15 - 76:20)
said it that it did flip back for me as (76:17 - 76:22)
well so uh that (76:20 - 76:27)
was an awful idea honestly like that (76:22 - 76:30)
just who nobody wanted that like please (76:27 - 76:32)
let me know if you wanted that I want to (76:30 - 76:34)
know why like literally like if I need (76:32 - 76:36)
to buy I need to spend money as fast as (76:34 - 76:38)
possible yeah I want I would love to (76:36 - 76:40)
actually know if there&#39;s anyone who saw (76:38 - 76:43)
that and enjoyed that update and then I (76:40 - 76:45)
would want to know why like and if it is (76:43 - 76:47)
just oh I buy a lot of coins and now I (76:45 - 76:48)
don&#39;t have to scroll to the bottom it&#39;s (76:47 - 76:51)
right there like I get that but no you (76:48 - 76:53)
should no I don&#39;t get that you shouldn&#39;t (76:51 - 76:57)
be buying coins in the IOS app or the (76:53 - 77:00)
Android app anymore as much as I dislike (76:57 - 77:02)
giving Niantic money and I&#39;m very vocal (77:00 - 77:04)
about this if you are to buy coins you (77:02 - 77:06)
should go to their web (77:04 - 77:09)
store because you will get more for your (77:06 - 77:11)
money I mean technically Niantic also (77:09 - 77:14)
gets more money from you because Google (77:11 - 77:16)
and apple take less of a they they don&#39;t (77:14 - 77:18)
take a cut on the web store but you as (77:16 - 77:20)
the user do get more (77:18 - 77:23)
coins on their web store that&#39;s true and (77:20 - 77:24)
they don&#39;t seem to care about that (77:23 - 77:27)
because they just want you to buy (77:24 - 77:29)
coins they just want you to buy coins (77:27 - 77:34)
any way possible yep yeah well I yeah I (77:29 - 77:34)
mean I don&#39;t want to tell people how to (77:34 - 77:36)
spend their money (77:34 - 77:39)
but St is right that you you were going (77:36 - 77:41)
to get more for your money there also if (77:39 - 77:42)
you&#39;ve never been to the web store (77:41 - 77:45)
before you do get a a discount on your (77:42 - 77:47)
first purchase over $10 so if you&#39;re (77:45 - 77:48)
actually thinking about making like a (77:47 - 77:51)
bigger coin purchase or something and (77:48 - 77:52)
you&#39;ve never used the Niantic web store (77:51 - 77:54)
at least I know in the US I don&#39;t know (77:52 - 77:56)
how it is across across the world but in (77:54 - 78:01)
the US uh I believe it&#39;s 15% off your (77:56 - 78:03)
very first purchase yeah in this web (78:01 - 78:06)
store so if you&#39;re looking at maybe (78:03 - 78:09)
buying like the $100 coins or or spend (78:06 - 78:11)
you know the one of the bigger purchases (78:09 - 78:14)
uh make and you haven&#39;t used the web (78:11 - 78:16)
store definitely go because you&#39;ll get (78:14 - 78:19)
you&#39;ll get a discount there um but all (78:16 - 78:21)
that to say the coins thing is the top (78:19 - 78:23)
terrible idea I&#39;m glad it&#39;s (78:21 - 78:26)
gone but now we just have the tickets at (78:23 - 78:28)
the top again and those still annoy me (78:26 - 78:30)
really let me tell you about an even (78:28 - 78:34)
more annoying ticket Hannah the daily (78:30 - 78:38)
pokecoin field research ticket for (78:34 - 78:41)
$1.99 yep I bought (78:38 - 78:44)
that you bought that I got to test it (78:41 - 78:46)
out we got to see okay that&#39;s a fair (78:44 - 78:48)
reason thank you for doing the research (78:46 - 78:54)
for us Bobby uh this this (78:48 - 78:54)
why would I pay you money for coins but (78:55 - 79:02)
then you also want me to do work to get (78:59 - 79:03)
those (79:02 - 79:08)
coins the re the reason I don&#39;t like sit (79:03 - 79:10)
there for five minutes and take out a (79:08 - 79:13)
gym is because in my head five minutes (79:10 - 79:16)
is not worth 50 cents if I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ll (79:13 - 79:18)
get the 50 cents I would rather just (79:16 - 79:23)
give you $5 and get however many coins (79:18 - 79:26)
is $5 than to like (79:23 - 79:29)
waste several like of course if I&#39;m at a (79:26 - 79:30)
restaurant or if I&#39;m sitting there I&#39;ll (79:29 - 79:33)
take out a gym but I&#39;m not like just (79:30 - 79:35)
talked about people making the most of (79:33 - 79:38)
their money and now you&#39;re like time is (79:35 - 79:40)
money Bobby time is money it takes if (79:38 - 79:43)
there&#39;s a Blissey and a melmetal and a (79:40 - 79:45)
slacking there that is not worth 50 (79:43 - 79:49)
cents no it is not that&#39;s just too much (79:45 - 79:53)
work for 50 but you want me to spend $22 (79:49 - 79:55)
to get an extra dollar back (79:53 - 79:59)
that&#39;s too much work 80 cents yeah 80 (79:55 - 80:01)
cents not even a full dollar somebody (79:59 - 80:03)
commented on my post and they said (80:01 - 80:05)
Niantic will try everything except a (80:03 - 80:08)
subscription model true why don&#39;t they (80:05 - 80:10)
just roll out a subscription (80:08 - 80:17)
just just do it yeah no I this is I did (80:10 - 80:19)
buy it to to test this out I know it (80:17 - 80:22)
starts I believe it&#39;s May 16th and check (80:19 - 80:23)
the dates on that but I believe it&#39;s May (80:22 - 80:26)
16th that it starts um it does sound I I (80:23 - 80:28)
really did buy it because I&#39;m I&#39;m (80:26 - 80:29)
actually interested in what this is (80:28 - 80:33)
going to really look like you can also (80:29 - 80:35)
you have to do tasks and then if you (80:33 - 80:37)
don&#39;t so one of the things is if you (80:35 - 80:41)
have a full task list so if you have (80:37 - 80:44)
four tasks already from you know builtup (80:41 - 80:47)
you don&#39;t get the daily thing so it if (80:44 - 80:49)
you look at the way that this works is (80:47 - 80:51)
you have to do a daily task to get the (80:49 - 80:54)
coins each day and when you if you do it (80:51 - 80:56)
each day for that period of time which (80:54 - 80:59)
is I think two weeks you get 280 coins (80:56 - 81:01)
in total so technically if you do the (80:59 - 81:05)
work every single day you paid $2 you (81:01 - 81:08)
get 80 more cents you get you know 80 (81:05 - 81:09)
you know you usually get crazy to me you (81:08 - 81:12)
usually get 200 coins for $2 you get 280 (81:09 - 81:18)
coins for this $2 but if if one day you (81:12 - 81:21)
already have four tasks in your research (81:18 - 81:24)
tasks and the night goes to the next day (81:21 - 81:26)
you don&#39;t get the ask for the coins for (81:24 - 81:29)
that day so it&#39;s possible that you could (81:26 - 81:32)
actually go through this and not get the (81:29 - 81:35)
280 coins if you forget that you have (81:32 - 81:37)
your task list full at the end of the (81:35 - 81:39)
night or if you&#39;re not doing it every (81:37 - 81:41)
single day or if you don&#39;t open the app (81:39 - 81:43)
for the day yeah you don&#39;t open the app (81:41 - 81:46)
or just don&#39;t do a task that day or the (81:43 - 81:48)
the task that it is and I don&#39;t know I (81:46 - 81:49)
don&#39;t think it said what the tasks are (81:48 - 81:53)
yet so I I would hope it&#39;s not like do a (81:49 - 81:56)
ra a raid something (81:53 - 82:00)
if Niantic wanted to get people out to (81:56 - 82:03)
do more things to like play their game (82:00 - 82:06)
every day I feel like the the the task (82:03 - 82:09)
you get for free the the covid task that (82:06 - 82:11)
has they actually didn&#39;t remove which is (82:09 - 82:12)
really great where you get like well (82:11 - 82:16)
they introduced it during Co that&#39;s yeah (82:12 - 82:18)
sure the one thing from Co they didn&#39;t (82:16 - 82:22)
like Backtrack on but the I don&#39;t I (82:18 - 82:25)
don&#39;t think five coins is generous by by (82:22 - 82:27)
any means but if that task that popped (82:25 - 82:31)
up daily was like spin a stop and get (82:27 - 82:34)
five coins and you were getting 55 coins (82:31 - 82:37)
a week which is still not enough to get (82:34 - 82:41)
a a raid pass but that would still be (82:37 - 82:43)
better than this it would be better than (82:41 - 82:45)
anything they&#39;ve ever tried people want (82:43 - 82:48)
a way to get coins that isn&#39;t gyms (82:45 - 82:50)
because one people don&#39;t have gyms two (82:48 - 82:51)
you&#39;re going to approach a gym you&#39;re (82:50 - 82:53)
going to see a Blissey a slacking and a (82:51 - 82:54)
Mel medal and you&#39;re going to be like (82:53 - 82:56)
this is going to take 15 minutes of my (82:54 - 82:58)
time for 50 cents I could make more (82:56 - 83:00)
working at McDonald&#39;s and McDonald&#39;s (82:58 - 83:01)
employees should be getting paid way (83:00 - 83:04)
more than they already do (83:01 - 83:07)
um like they could they could literally (83:04 - 83:09)
give you five cents a day and that would (83:07 - 83:12)
be more incentive to go out (83:09 - 83:16)
versus give us $2 and we will give you (83:12 - 83:20)
80 cents back that is insane that is (83:16 - 83:23)
crazy maybe if this was give us $2 and (83:20 - 83:26)
we&#39;d give you $3 back so you&#39;d get 500 (83:23 - 83:28)
coins total I&#39;d be like (83:26 - 83:31)
M just well one just do a subscription (83:28 - 83:35)
at that point but like 80 cents is (83:31 - 83:37)
actually (83:35 - 83:40)
crazy I think a bigger thing too is and (83:37 - 83:42)
they&#39;ve done this before with like the (83:40 - 83:44)
timed research right when you pay for a (83:42 - 83:47)
timed research but you don&#39;t finish it (83:44 - 83:48)
you know you don&#39;t get whatever the (83:47 - 83:50)
items are like if you&#39;re if we&#39;re paying (83:48 - 83:52)
for something give us the thing we&#39;re (83:50 - 83:55)
paying for like it doesn&#39;t like it&#39;s (83:52 - 83:57)
ridiculous to think that if you they (83:55 - 83:59)
literally had to put a disclaimer in it (83:57 - 84:01)
that said like if you&#39;re are full if (83:59 - 84:03)
your items or task list is full you may (84:01 - 84:05)
not get the coin task for the day that (84:03 - 84:07)
should never be a thing that should (84:05 - 84:10)
never ever be a thing that doesn&#39;t make (84:07 - 84:13)
any sense that should wait how much how (84:10 - 84:16)
much is the task giving you 5 20 it must (84:13 - 84:18)
be because it&#39;s 280 (84:16 - 84:20)
over I want to say like a 14-day period (84:18 - 84:21)
which would make sense it&#39; be 20 cents (84:20 - 84:25)
it&#39; be 20 coins a day right if it was 14 (84:21 - 84:28)
days so I think that&#39;s about right I (84:25 - 84:31)
think it&#39;s May 16th through May 30th or (84:28 - 84:35)
something like that so yeah 20 coins a (84:31 - 84:37)
day but it&#39;s just it&#39;s ridiculous to me (84:35 - 84:39)
that that that there&#39;s even a disclaimer (84:37 - 84:42)
to say that you&#39;re going to pay us $2 (84:39 - 84:45)
we&#39;re going to give you 280 coins except (84:42 - 84:48)
if you miss four of the days you could (84:45 - 84:51)
have just bought $2 worth of coins (84:48 - 84:53)
like again I don&#39;t even know what these (84:51 - 84:55)
tasks are but I can&#39;t imagine that (84:53 - 84:56)
that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s going to make (84:55 - 84:58)
people think oh this is fun I&#39;m going to (84:56 - 85:01)
do a task you know and I say again I say (84:58 - 85:03)
this as someone who purchased it so I I (85:01 - 85:06)
understand my position here is weird but (85:03 - 85:07)
it (85:06 - 85:12)
is completely ridiculous and I as we (85:07 - 85:13)
talk about this I feel worse and worse (85:12 - 85:15)
about paying for it but again someone (85:13 - 85:18)
has to test this and it&#39;s going to be me (85:15 - 85:21)
thank you for do you even get (85:18 - 85:24)
like I know that&#39;s a very small minority (85:21 - 85:26)
of people out there but they care about (85:24 - 85:29)
their task list of like if you scroll (85:26 - 85:31)
over you can see like every task you&#39;ve (85:29 - 85:36)
ever done yeah I care show does it show (85:31 - 85:39)
up there it probably will because most (85:36 - 85:41)
most things that you pay for show up (85:39 - 85:44)
there um most not all definitely not all (85:41 - 85:47)
but so it&#39;s not going to be the daily (85:44 - 85:49)
research but it&#39;s a daily it is a daily (85:47 - 85:50)
research it&#39;s the daily research it&#39;s (85:49 - 85:52)
not showing up there right well yeah (85:50 - 85:53)
that&#39;s right that&#39;s true because it&#39;s a (85:52 - 85:56)
daily task yeah because it goes away (85:53 - 85:58)
unless there&#39;s a timed research that (85:56 - 86:00)
goes with it where it&#39;s like complete (85:58 - 86:03)
this task this many times um but that (86:00 - 86:05)
would be even worse because if you miss (86:03 - 86:06)
it one day then you wouldn&#39;t complet (86:05 - 86:09)
yeah I&#39;m this is bad this is all bad (86:06 - 86:11)
this is a terrible idea I don&#39;t know why (86:09 - 86:14)
they did this and I didn&#39;t help by (86:11 - 86:15)
buying it because there that&#39;s that&#39;s (86:14 - 86:17)
one more to the yes we got (86:15 - 86:21)
someone list yeah also like I&#39;m trying (86:17 - 86:23)
to think of ways to make this better why (86:21 - 86:25)
is it not 99 (86:23 - 86:28)
like why is it $2 why did they decide $2 (86:25 - 86:33)
will get you $280 back like it&#39;s such (86:28 - 86:36)
a it like I don&#39;t want to say like no (86:33 - 86:39)
thought has went into it but very weird (86:36 - 86:41)
selective thought went into this too (86:39 - 86:43)
much thought went into it I think is the (86:41 - 86:45)
problem here it almost also because it&#39;s (86:43 - 86:46)
like two weeks (86:45 - 86:49)
beforehand it it feels like they&#39;re (86:46 - 86:51)
taking our $2 to put that into some fund (86:49 - 86:53)
to make interest on it over the next two (86:51 - 86:55)
weeks before they have to pay back the (86:53 - 86:57)
$280 that they&#39;re going (86:55 - 87:01)
to any money it&#39;s digital it&#39;s currency (86:57 - 87:04)
it it cost them nothing to give us coin (87:01 - 87:05)
I&#39;m just saying it feels like with the (87:04 - 87:07)
way that it&#39;s all planned out it feels (87:05 - 87:11)
very much like I want to be very clear I (87:07 - 87:15)
am not against giving games money (87:11 - 87:16)
especially if it makes you happy if (87:15 - 87:18)
you&#39;re if you&#39;re into it if it&#39;s the (87:16 - 87:21)
game you like I just when I when I think (87:18 - 87:24)
of like here are when I when I made the (87:21 - 87:26)
suggestion of like there should be a (87:24 - 87:28)
task every day that maybe gives you five (87:26 - 87:31)
coins it&#39;s not a lot by any means you (87:28 - 87:33)
can&#39;t gamify it right because you can&#39;t (87:31 - 87:35)
like go out and spin a stop and like try (87:33 - 87:37)
to get it it was it&#39;s the one given to (87:35 - 87:40)
you so there&#39;s no way to like again like (87:37 - 87:42)
gamify it but like I just think of (87:40 - 87:44)
Pokemon sleep where like sometimes when (87:42 - 87:47)
you hit the daily gift it gives you 10 (87:44 - 87:49)
gems which is not a lot of gems (87:47 - 87:51)
sometimes it gives you 50 most of the (87:49 - 87:53)
time it gives you 10 sometimes it gives (87:51 - 87:54)
you a poke biscuit I&#39;m actually really (87:53 - 87:56)
down with the Pokey biscuit that&#39;s like (87:54 - 87:58)
one of the best things it can give you (87:56 - 88:01)
but because it gives you like 10 gems a (87:58 - 88:03)
day sometimes (88:01 - 88:07)
mostly I got enough free gems to buy the (88:03 - 88:10)
syndic Quil bundle for free no cost (88:07 - 88:14)
that&#39;s 250 gems total that&#39;s like $5 in (88:10 - 88:16)
Pokemon sleep currency because that game (88:14 - 88:21)
is priced very weirdly but it I don&#39;t (88:16 - 88:23)
even have to leave my house Niantic I (88:21 - 88:27)
just have to log into Pokemon sleep and (88:23 - 88:29)
hit the gift button and sometimes it&#39;s a (88:27 - 88:31)
poke biscuit sometimes it&#39;s 10 gems (88:29 - 88:33)
sometimes it&#39;s an energy pillow like if (88:31 - 88:36)
you want people to leave your house and (88:33 - 88:38)
play your game outside which I get (88:36 - 88:40)
that&#39;s that&#39;s your goal if you want (88:38 - 88:41)
people to spend money on your game if (88:40 - 88:44)
you want people to like go into the (88:41 - 88:46)
store look at what Pokemon sleep is (88:44 - 88:48)
doing because they&#39;re doing everything (88:46 - 88:52)
right like it&#39;s like I I if I&#39;m if I (88:48 - 88:54)
have a choice of like I have $20 this (88:52 - 88:55)
month to give to a game I (88:54 - 88:58)
love is going to go to Pokemon sleep (88:55 - 89:00)
they just they&#39;re just doing everything (88:58 - 89:02)
right they&#39;re balancing the game they&#39;re (89:00 - 89:04)
apologizing for things that are broken (89:02 - 89:05)
they&#39;re they&#39;re giving you incentive to (89:04 - 89:08)
log in the events are really great the (89:05 - 89:10)
only thing wrong with Pokemon sleep is (89:08 - 89:11)
their store is (89:10 - 89:14)
expensive like I will give it to Niantic (89:11 - 89:17)
that like a raid pass and like a a lucky (89:14 - 89:19)
egg and a star piece isn&#39;t like that (89:17 - 89:22)
expensive compared to other mobile (89:19 - 89:26)
games like I&#39;ll give it to them (89:22 - 89:30)
there but this daily poke coin thing is (89:26 - 89:33)
outrageous was I&#39;m just looking for the (89:30 - 89:35)
daily poke coin like was there ever an (89:33 - 89:37)
announcement made for this because I&#39;m (89:35 - 89:38)
not seeing it anywhere like it&#39;s not on (89:37 - 89:41)
the Pokemon go live website it&#39;s nowhere (89:38 - 89:43)
at this point no it&#39;s not on their (89:41 - 89:45)
website (89:43 - 89:48)
yeah (89:45 - 89:52)
it I mean Pokemon sleep again is still (89:48 - 89:55)
in the early days they&#39;re they&#39;re still (89:52 - 89:57)
in the stage of a company where they (89:55 - 89:59)
have to be making their users as happy (89:57 - 90:02)
as possible that could and probably will (89:59 - 90:06)
change with time Pokemon go is long past (90:02 - 90:08)
that point long past (90:06 - 90:09)
that (90:08 - 90:14)
yeah that&#39;s true yeah I I have the (90:09 - 90:18)
ticket in my like storage and it says (90:14 - 90:21)
May 16th through May 30th um it&#39;ll give (90:18 - 90:22)
you automatically activate the daily (90:21 - 90:25)
pokecoin field research ticket (90:22 - 90:29)
experience on May 16th wherever you (90:25 - 90:33)
are if this had been a free thing if it (90:29 - 90:36)
was just automatically integrated so (90:33 - 90:38)
everyone could go out and get five coins (90:36 - 90:40)
a day like Steve said just automatically (90:38 - 90:42)
I think that would get people out there (90:40 - 90:47)
but having to pay for the that for a (90:42 - 90:51)
chance at that is absurd it really is (90:47 - 90:54)
and even if it&#39;s just paying for a (90:51 - 90:56)
chance to test something that could (90:54 - 90:59)
potentially be free in the (90:56 - 91:02)
future that&#39;s weird and it doesn&#39;t make (90:59 - 91:06)
people feel good about it so they did do (91:02 - 91:09)
that thing in Australia a couple years (91:06 - 91:13)
ago where there was four years ago was (91:09 - 91:15)
it like four years ago at this four (91:13 - 91:17)
years ago yeah okay three or four it was (91:15 - 91:20)
like right before the pandemic I think (91:17 - 91:21)
oh was it thought it was right after the (91:20 - 91:23)
start I don&#39;t know oh may it was years (91:21 - 91:26)
ago it was a long time yeah all the (91:23 - 91:30)
years melted together so uh they tried (91:26 - 91:34)
that and it didn&#39;t work and I I know (91:30 - 91:36)
there are people who obviously will (91:34 - 91:38)
remember this or know exactly what it (91:36 - 91:40)
was but something about it didn&#39;t work (91:38 - 91:43)
uh because I think it had to do with you (91:40 - 91:44)
were getting coins a different way but (91:43 - 91:45)
then there was some weird thing (91:44 - 91:47)
happening with the gyms in that like it (91:45 - 91:50)
was it was the it was the gyms became (91:47 - 91:52)
way more Territorial and people were (91:50 - 91:55)
arguing over gyms because the time in (91:52 - 91:58)
gyms changed so you had to be in the gym (91:55 - 92:01)
longer for Less coins I think it was (91:58 - 92:04)
like you could earn 35 coins in a gym (92:01 - 92:08)
but you could earn more coins outside of (92:04 - 92:09)
a gym but all in all you could only (92:08 - 92:12)
still earn 50 coins a day so like they (92:09 - 92:14)
would have a research of like Catch 10 (92:12 - 92:16)
Pokemon get five coins you&#39;d have to (92:14 - 92:20)
find that do it um but the people who (92:16 - 92:21)
were relying on (92:20 - 92:25)
gyms got more up set because they were (92:21 - 92:28)
getting less coins for the same amount (92:25 - 92:30)
of time that was technically the issue (92:28 - 92:32)
yeah yeah if I remember right it caused (92:30 - 92:34)
a weird amount of fighting and (92:32 - 92:37)
contention between the (92:34 - 92:40)
players I just I don&#39;t know I hey I (92:37 - 92:42)
don&#39;t think they need to change the gym (92:40 - 92:45)
system there is like just so many other (92:42 - 92:47)
ways you can go about doing it and just (92:45 - 92:50)
I don&#39;t know there&#39;s just and this isn&#39;t (92:47 - 92:52)
the way to do it either making people (92:50 - 92:55)
pay so that you can give them 80 extra (92:52 - 92:58)
coins potentially 80 extra coins if they (92:55 - 93:02)
do 14 days of tasks is not the way to do (92:58 - 93:04)
it I think if they added a new system (93:02 - 93:06)
then they don&#39;t necessarily need to (93:04 - 93:08)
change the gym system to even it out I (93:06 - 93:13)
think that was the main problem (93:08 - 93:15)
yeah otherwise they do need to change (93:13 - 93:17)
the gym system but what if there was (93:15 - 93:21)
like this thing called a subscription (93:17 - 93:24)
and that gave you coins (93:21 - 93:25)
part of your (93:24 - 93:29)
subscription yep what if that would be (93:25 - 93:30)
that would be novel that would be a (93:29 - 93:32)
whole new (93:30 - 93:32)
idea I mean there should still be ways (93:34 - 93:38)
other than gyms to earn coins I I I (93:36 - 93:40)
don&#39;t think a subscription solves that (93:38 - 93:43)
issue fully (93:40 - 93:45)
but it would feel better than whatever (93:43 - 93:49)
this is yes I it just seems (93:45 - 93:53)
like again I&#39;ve said this before I don&#39;t (93:49 - 93:56)
think just because remote raid passes (93:53 - 94:00)
got decreased and decreased in usage or (93:56 - 94:03)
limited and the price went up nitic is (94:00 - 94:06)
scrambling for money I think they would (94:03 - 94:08)
be doing all of this stuff anyways (94:06 - 94:10)
because we&#39;re just in that point of the (94:08 - 94:12)
game where they&#39;re looking for other (94:10 - 94:14)
ways to get money because that remote (94:12 - 94:17)
raid pass audience is still a select (94:14 - 94:19)
audience not everyone did raids not (94:17 - 94:22)
everyone cared about raids not everyone (94:19 - 94:24)
did 20 or 30 raids a day so like I still (94:22 - 94:28)
think these ways to get money from you (94:24 - 94:29)
would have still popped up whether or (94:28 - 94:32)
not people cared or did not care about (94:29 - 94:33)
the remote raid pass issues I just think (94:32 - 94:35)
the ways they&#39;re trying to get money out (94:33 - 94:38)
of you is just so (94:35 - 94:42)
weird um go put like this like pay $2 to (94:38 - 94:45)
get $3 back it&#39;s not even a full $3 it&#39;s (94:42 - 94:48)
$280 like if you want to get money out (94:45 - 94:50)
of people the subscription model is (94:48 - 94:54)
right there (94:50 - 94:54)
it&#39;s already people activate (94:54 - 94:59)
subscriptions and then forget about them (94:56 - 95:00)
do you know how many people probably (94:59 - 95:01)
have a World of Warcraft subscription (95:00 - 95:03)
and haven&#39;t logged in in like eight (95:01 - 95:06)
months a lot they put code for (95:03 - 95:10)
subscriptions in the game years ago yeah (95:06 - 95:14)
never done anything with it (95:10 - 95:17)
no uh okay final B news is uh primarina (95:14 - 95:19)
is in seven star raids like I said you (95:17 - 95:21)
just keep saying it over and over it&#39;ll (95:19 - 95:25)
finally happen um it was a fairy type (95:21 - 95:26)
primarina which means it&#39;s fairy type (95:25 - 95:30)
moves are stab boosted same type attack (95:26 - 95:35)
B bonus boosted and Terra boosted uh (95:30 - 95:38)
which means that moonblast would hit (95:35 - 95:39)
very (95:38 - 95:42)
hard um it does have its signature move (95:39 - 95:46)
sparkling ARA it has sing and Encore (95:42 - 95:49)
which like thematically makes sense it&#39;s (95:46 - 95:51)
kind of like Greninja having toxic (95:49 - 95:54)
spikes it&#39;s just like (95:51 - 95:57)
the Pokemon that is a singer has Encore (95:54 - 96:00)
and sing makes sense um and then it also (95:57 - 96:01)
has (96:00 - 96:04)
Surf and psychic so it has the poison (96:01 - 96:08)
type coverage because fair is weak to (96:04 - 96:10)
poison uh it has nothing to deal with (96:08 - 96:13)
steel types which is what my video was (96:10 - 96:16)
based on so if you need Pokemon (96:13 - 96:18)
suggestions all the builds in my video (96:16 - 96:22)
work really well against primarina um (96:18 - 96:28)
the cool thing that I discovered is (96:22 - 96:28)
that um the ability of toxcity which is (96:30 - 96:37)
punk rock actually reduces the damage of (96:34 - 96:40)
sound based moves not that primarina (96:37 - 96:42)
would really use sparkling ARA but (96:40 - 96:44)
sparkling ARA is a water type move and (96:42 - 96:48)
it&#39;s a sound based move and tox toxcity (96:44 - 96:50)
punk rock reduces that damage it&#39;s just (96:48 - 96:52)
really cool uh that it does that (96:50 - 96:54)
primarina is just going to default to (96:52 - 96:57)
use psychic anyways um but then also a (96:54 - 96:59)
move like sing which is a normal type (96:57 - 97:02)
move gets turned into a water type move (96:59 - 97:04)
so that means Pokemon with water absorb (97:02 - 97:07)
like Vaporeon or Claire or gastrodon (97:04 - 97:09)
they can&#39;t get put to sleep because it (97:07 - 97:11)
will suck up it it will suck it up as a (97:09 - 97:14)
water type move which is really cool not (97:11 - 97:15)
that I&#39;ve tested this but you could (97:14 - 97:17)
bring a Pokemon like (97:15 - 97:20)
bastiodon which is a rock steel Pokemon (97:17 - 97:24)
rock is weak to water but Spark Arya is (97:20 - 97:29)
a sound based move and Bas bastiodon has (97:24 - 97:31)
soundproof so it can&#39;t actually get hit (97:29 - 97:34)
by it which is kind of (97:31 - 97:35)
cool (97:34 - 97:39)
um if there was ever a new type added to (97:35 - 97:41)
a Pokemon game you would think that it (97:39 - 97:43)
would be sound type because there are (97:41 - 97:46)
like 20 plus sound type moves but (97:43 - 97:47)
they&#39;re yeah and they&#39;ve already (97:46 - 97:49)
separated them out in the way the moves (97:47 - 97:52)
interact with all of those abilities and (97:49 - 97:55)
everything yes like sound already kind (97:52 - 97:58)
of a category of move yeah there&#39;s like (97:55 - 97:59)
soundproof there&#39;s punk rock there&#39;s (97:58 - 98:01)
like a bunch of abilities that interact (97:59 - 98:04)
with sound and there&#39;s a bunch of moves (98:01 - 98:06)
that are sound um and there&#39;s moves like (98:04 - 98:09)
throat chop which stops all sound based (98:06 - 98:12)
moves so toxtricity Berserker a bunch of (98:09 - 98:14)
Pokemon in my video learn throat chop so (98:12 - 98:16)
you can throat chop you stop sing for (98:14 - 98:19)
everyone you stop sparkling Arya for (98:16 - 98:21)
everyone um those are the only two sound (98:19 - 98:23)
based moves but you stop those moves for (98:21 - 98:24)
everyone so you can throat chop attack (98:23 - 98:26)
throat chop attack throat and then they (98:24 - 98:28)
primarina can never sing cuz you&#39;re (98:26 - 98:32)
chopping its throat it&#39;s very brutal (98:28 - 98:34)
yeah I never realized that that was that (98:32 - 98:38)
that did that but that is really uh a (98:34 - 98:41)
little violent there yeah yeah a little (98:38 - 98:45)
bit it&#39;s not the only one no definitely (98:41 - 98:48)
not uh primarina is dropping urbam (98:45 - 98:51)
mystica uh so and like I said that (98:48 - 98:54)
YouTube video is up primarina will be (98:51 - 98:56)
gone by the time this podcast is up but (98:54 - 98:58)
then Returns the following Thursday (98:56 - 99:00)
Friday Saturday Sunday if you need to (98:58 - 99:03)
catch it um or if you just want to grind (99:00 - 99:06)
out raids for urb mystica it&#39;s a (99:03 - 99:08)
relatively straightforward raid once you (99:06 - 99:11)
understand how sound-based moves work (99:08 - 99:13)
there&#39;s lots of ways to stop sing you (99:11 - 99:15)
can Misty terrain you can electric (99:13 - 99:17)
terrain you can Safeguard you can throat (99:15 - 99:21)
chop you can have water absorb (99:17 - 99:22)
there&#39;s even if you&#39;re playing with (99:21 - 99:25)
randoms there&#39;s lots of ways to stop (99:22 - 99:30)
sing and sparkling Arya um just don&#39;t (99:25 - 99:32)
bring anything weak to fairy don&#39;t bring (99:30 - 99:36)
coridon it&#39;s four times (99:32 - 99:36)
week don&#39;t bring anything weak to (99:36 - 99:41)
fairy uh we are going in Elite Four (99:39 - 99:45)
order so we did uh Crispen with Blazin (99:41 - 99:48)
and then we did amoris Amor amoris with (99:45 - 99:51)
impon and then there was a break for the (99:48 - 99:52)
Kanto starters and then there was a (99:51 - 99:54)
break to celebrate (99:52 - 99:57)
cherry blossoms with Meganium also April (99:54 - 99:58)
Fool&#39;s (99:57 - 100:01)
Meganium uh and then there was primarina (99:58 - 100:04)
with fairy so the next sevenstar raid (100:01 - 100:05)
should be (100:04 - 100:08)
septile and because it&#39;s straightens (100:05 - 100:12)
Pokemon and because septile is a dragon (100:08 - 100:16)
when it magas I am super confident that (100:12 - 100:18)
the septile is going to be dragon type (100:16 - 100:21)
MH it also learns a million Dragon type (100:18 - 100:24)
moves if you look at its move set (100:21 - 100:26)
almost no doubt there yeah um and then (100:24 - 100:29)
after that should be incinerar because (100:26 - 100:30)
that is (100:29 - 100:33)
kieran&#39;s starter although I don&#39;t know (100:30 - 100:35)
what type that would be I haven&#39;t really (100:33 - 100:37)
thought about that we haven&#39;t gotten a (100:35 - 100:39)
dark type (100:37 - 100:41)
Tera yet so I could just see it being (100:39 - 100:43)
dark (100:41 - 100:46)
type um what do you mean you haven&#39;t got (100:43 - 100:49)
one yet uh Seven Star raid boss has not (100:46 - 100:51)
been dark yet oh right cu the Charizard (100:49 - 100:53)
was Dragon right Charizard was Dragon (100:51 - 100:56)
right um I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve gotten the (100:53 - 100:58)
first steel Pokémon we got was Blastoise (100:56 - 101:00)
um but I don&#39;t think we got and the (100:58 - 101:03)
first ground we got was I think the (101:00 - 101:05)
first ground was Venusaur so the only (101:03 - 101:08)
two we&#39;re missing is dark and (101:05 - 101:10)
electric did did they give us a dark (101:08 - 101:12)
Tera Charizard then they did there was a (101:10 - 101:15)
GameStop Dark Charizard I think we may (101:12 - 101:17)
have had this conversation before it (101:15 - 101:20)
yeah cuz the the Terra in the um in the (101:17 - 101:22)
card game for Charizard is dark yeah (101:20 - 101:25)
yeah yeah (101:22 - 101:27)
um obviously they still have they still (101:25 - 101:29)
have embor they still have Superior they (101:27 - 101:32)
still have feraligator they still have (101:29 - 101:36)
Swamper um there&#39;s a lot of starters (101:32 - 101:38)
I&#39;m they got we got starters for the (101:36 - 101:40)
rest of the (101:38 - 101:42)
year I think there are only eight that (101:40 - 101:45)
they haven&#39;t done yeah but if they&#39;re (101:42 - 101:48)
doing one every three weeks that that (101:45 - 101:51)
gets us to the end of the (101:48 - 101:54)
year yes yes it does I think it does (101:51 - 101:56)
with like a break in between there here (101:54 - 101:59)
and there for different yeah celebration (101:56 - 102:01)
stuff or whatever different yeah I would (101:59 - 102:02)
assume they&#39;re going to stop the (102:01 - 102:05)
starters for worlds or what and there (102:02 - 102:07)
should be something (102:05 - 102:10)
special we would think maybe a Shiny (102:07 - 102:12)
Rayquaza uh maybe they bring Mewtwo back (102:10 - 102:14)
for another round I could see them doing (102:12 - 102:17)
that they like to repeat their special (102:14 - 102:20)
events (102:17 - 102:22)
um they did do that random iron bundle (102:20 - 102:25)
that wasn&#39;t a starter at all uh and that (102:22 - 102:27)
was fun for Christmas yeah MH that&#39;s (102:25 - 102:29)
true but we&#39;re in that part of the Year (102:27 - 102:32)
where holidays that are typically (102:29 - 102:35)
celebrated in games are few and far (102:32 - 102:39)
between yeah and I would (102:35 - 102:42)
assume near the end of this life cycle (102:39 - 102:44)
they will do gorging fire G uh gouging (102:42 - 102:47)
fire I always say gorging I likes to (102:44 - 102:51)
Gorge uh gouging fire raging bolt I (102:47 - 102:52)
would assume those would but they (102:51 - 102:54)
wouldn&#39;t be seven star they would be (102:52 - 102:56)
five star like walking wake and iron (102:54 - 103:01)
leaves were festar so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t (102:56 - 103:06)
have as uh solid and uh I don&#39;t feel (103:01 - 103:07)
like those will necessarily show up in (103:06 - 103:09)
raids but we&#39;ll see you don&#39;t think I (103:07 - 103:11)
feel like that would be like their last (103:09 - 103:15)
harah like we&#39;re we&#39;re done with this (103:11 - 103:16)
we&#39;re moving to gen 10 not that we&#39;re (103:15 - 103:19)
moving to gen 10 anytime soon but I feel (103:16 - 103:20)
like the only reason they keep doing (103:19 - 103:22)
walking wake and our leaves is just (103:20 - 103:24)
because they&#39;re trapped in there there (103:22 - 103:25)
yeah that&#39;s the only way to get them (103:24 - 103:28)
yeah mhm yeah I don&#39;t think they (103:25 - 103:30)
necessarily need to do it with the rest (103:28 - 103:31)
of them but they&#39;ve done it with they do (103:30 - 103:33)
it with a bunch of the other Paradox (103:31 - 103:37)
Pokemon so like but I think the reason I (103:33 - 103:40)
think so is because at least in Sun and (103:37 - 103:42)
Moon Ultra sun and moon they gave you (103:40 - 103:45)
two basilon and two stakataka to like (103:42 - 103:46)
trade (103:45 - 103:50)
one and there&#39;s no way like I don&#39;t have (103:46 - 103:54)
raging bolt or (103:50 - 103:56)
gouging fire because I haven&#39;t finished (103:54 - 103:58)
my copy of scarlet I finished Violet so (103:56 - 104:02)
I caught Boulder and Crown but like I (103:58 - 104:03)
used to have every Pokemon in Pokemon (104:02 - 104:05)
home but I I don&#39;t have those two just (104:03 - 104:08)
because I I have to beat the Elite (104:05 - 104:11)
Four they they could also do it as like (104:08 - 104:14)
a they might they they could get people (104:11 - 104:16)
to GameStop and maybe you&#39;ll trade them (104:14 - 104:17)
your PSA cards while you&#39;re there and (104:16 - 104:20)
pick up a raging bolt and a gouging Fire (104:17 - 104:20)
for (104:20 - 104:22)
free they could I don&#39;t think they do (104:20 - 104:25)
that anymore (104:22 - 104:27)
do they not they could was the last (104:25 - 104:29)
GameStop distribution there was one (104:27 - 104:31)
relatively recently it was the Halloween (104:29 - 104:35)
mimik QQ was that the last one feel like (104:31 - 104:39)
there was maybe one more recent but that (104:35 - 104:42)
definitely yeah I know I missed that (104:39 - 104:46)
one yeah I don&#39;t (104:42 - 104:49)
know yeah I&#39;m sure yeah I guess anyways (104:46 - 104:52)
Premarin video is up um all of those (104:49 - 104:56)
builds are or or fund uh they work well (104:52 - 104:59)
in groups or not (104:56 - 105:03)
groups most I they you&#39;ll figure it out (104:59 - 105:06)
watch the video just watch the (105:03 - 105:10)
video seti&#39;s next unless there&#39;s some (105:06 - 105:12)
weird event that they&#39;re going to like (105:10 - 105:15)
be pulled with Meganium I&#39;m so confident (105:12 - 105:17)
on septile I&#39;m going to build counters (105:15 - 105:20)
this week wow and then when they (105:17 - 105:23)
announce it publish on that video It&#39;s (105:20 - 105:24)
going to be (105:23 - 105:27)
ready to go I&#39;m so confident on Dragon (105:24 - 105:27)
type (105:27 - 105:30)
septile uh watch watch them take another (105:27 - 105:34)
break yeah yeah well I&#39;ll have the video (105:30 - 105:36)
done at least Han I just have to wait (105:34 - 105:38)
for them to announce it and then I&#39;ll (105:36 - 105:40)
hit the (105:38 - 105:40)
button you know what they could also do (105:42 - 105:48)
in raids they could do other Legends (105:44 - 105:50)
like they did Diago Pia Dio Palkia were (105:48 - 105:53)
five star and you could only catch one (105:50 - 105:56)
MH but they could do something like that (105:53 - 105:58)
um like the forces of (105:56 - 106:01)
nature or (105:58 - 106:01)
Anam where is (106:04 - 106:07)
she people would be so happy about that (106:08 - 106:14)
karx is not in the game well karx is in (106:11 - 106:16)
the game but you could catch the horses (106:14 - 106:17)
but you couldn&#39;t catch (106:16 - 106:20)
kerx could do calorex he could be riding (106:17 - 106:23)
a horse (106:20 - 106:23)
uh there&#39;s a lot of stuff they could do (106:26 - 106:30)
for the rest of the year is what I&#39;m (106:28 - 106:31)
saying (106:30 - 106:34)
