[Music] (0:01 - 0:26)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:27 - 0:32)
400 47th 70th (0:29 - 0:35)
7-0 episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:32 - 0:36)
super effective (0:35 - 0:39)
the half a year until we get to 500. uh (0:36 - 0:40)
i'm your (0:39 - 0:43)
i'm your host sbj uh we were recording (0:40 - 0:45)
this before go fest but i'm sure (0:43 - 0:48)
uh i wow that makeup day they announced (0:45 - 0:52)
for go fest sounds real great (0:48 - 0:52)
the giant error that happened on go fest (0:52 - 0:56)
i can't believe niantic was so (0:54 - 0:59)
unprofessional to allow (0:56 - 1:02)
insert error here to happen i'm outraged (0:59 - 1:03)
i demand (1:02 - 1:07)
insert treats here uh (1:03 - 1:09)
do it (1:07 - 1:09)
too late will's here so the error (1:11 - 1:17)
that has now launched this campaign of (1:15 - 1:19)
disaster that will tumble through (1:17 - 1:22)
the entire weekend is that steve (1:19 - 1:23)
believes that 30 (1:22 - 1:28)
is half of 52. (1:23 - 1:28)
uh you just said half a year until we (1:29 - 1:34)
get to episode 500 (1:32 - 1:38)
half a year is 26 weeks (1:34 - 1:41)
not 30. i was rounding up (1:38 - 1:44)
rounding up you know the other is (1:41 - 1:47)
it is well established on this show that (1:44 - 1:48)
steve (1:47 - 1:51)
rounds it's quick there's no seven so (1:48 - 1:55)
therefore you round past seven (1:51 - 1:55)
[Laughter] (1:56 - 2:01)
i have now switched to a higher (2:00 - 2:04)
definition recording device (2:01 - 2:08)
so you can see in great detail (2:04 - 2:11)
what a mess we've got going on beautiful (2:08 - 2:13)
beautiful beautiful eyes (2:11 - 2:15)
no thank you see you can't do that with (2:13 - 2:16)
mike because if i take my glasses off i (2:15 - 2:18)
can't see a thing (2:16 - 2:23)
but you're so shakespearean i'm like how (2:18 - 2:23)
if i'm not rounding up or down if you (2:24 - 2:28)
would share the outline and let us know (2:26 - 2:30)
what narratives we're supposed to be (2:28 - 2:31)
pushing it would help (2:30 - 2:33)
instead of letting us be free-wheeling (2:31 - 2:34)
free agents (2:33 - 2:36)
just running around the internet making (2:34 - 2:39)
stuff up (2:36 - 2:40)

saw how mad people were a year ago (14:26 - 14:32)
compared to now like (14:29 - 14:32)
everyone seems hyped for this game and (14:32 - 14:35)
it looks good (14:34 - 14:38)
it looks really fun i mean (14:35 - 14:40)
it's been enough time that the people (14:38 - 14:42)
who just complained about everything got (14:40 - 14:44)
tired and went away (14:42 - 14:45)
and there's only people who are excited (14:44 - 14:47)
about the game who are paying attention (14:45 - 14:48)
to the news (14:47 - 14:50)
but some people have had hands-on (14:48 - 14:51)
experience with it (14:50 - 14:54)
yeah yeah i mean you could have uh (14:51 - 14:56)
switched your switch to the japanese (14:54 - 14:57)
region and download the (14:56 - 15:01)
open beta and i think most people really (14:57 - 15:03)
most people that did that i think ended (15:01 - 15:05)
up enjoying it i didn't really hear (15:03 - 15:06)
anyone walk away (15:05 - 15:07)
i've heard people say like oh i've (15:06 - 15:10)
played mobas mobos aren't for me (15:07 - 15:13)
totally fair uh and i've seen people (15:10 - 15:15)
who played it and they were like wow i (15:13 - 15:17)
really liked it i can't wait till i can (15:15 - 15:19)
read it in english (15:17 - 15:23)
until i know what's happening uh (15:19 - 15:24)
but yeah people seem really really (15:23 - 15:27)
positive i think the only maybe (15:24 - 15:30)
outstanding negative thing that you (15:27 - 15:33)
that no one can control is you know 10 (15:30 - 15:35)
cent has their hands in this (15:33 - 15:38)
and people don't like 10 cent i think (15:35 - 15:39)
it's ironic when people complain on (15:38 - 15:41)
discord or reddit about 10 cent when (15:39 - 15:43)
tencent has huge investments in both (15:41 - 15:45)
reddit and discord (15:43 - 15:47)
but you know i'm not here to def i'm not (15:45 - 15:50)
defending 10 cent i'm just kidding (15:47 - 15:52)
no i'm not i'm just saying it's ironic (15:50 - 15:54)
if you complain about 10 cent on (15:52 - 15:56)
reddit about 10 cent being like i'm not (15:54 - 15:58)
going to play unite because 10 (15:56 - 15:59)
but it's like you're using reddit like (15:58 - 16:02)
they put a huge investment into reddit (15:59 - 16:03)
like two years ago (16:02 - 16:05)
but what you're arguing is that people (16:03 - 16:06)
are uh (16:05 - 16:09)
inconsistent and ill-informed correct (16:06 - 16:12)
which is a known issue (16:09 - 16:12)
yeah but no no one likes tencent no one (16:13 - 16:18)
likes amazon (16:17 - 16:19)
nobody likes amazon no one likes tencent (16:18 - 16:21)
no one likes microsoft (16:19 - 16:24)
nobody just had a change in leadership (16:21 - 16:26)
we're re-evaluating our relationship (16:24 - 16:27)
with that company (16:26 - 16:29)
we also have a huge change in their (16:27 - 16:31)
corporate philosophy they need to drop (16:29 - 16:33)
their horrible commercials from (16:31 - 16:37)
google before even consider (16:33 - 16:38)
joining in if i have to watch one more (16:37 - 16:40)
youtube where a person's telling me that (16:38 - 16:41)
their pay (16:40 - 16:44)
is awesome i'm out oh (16:41 - 16:46)
i mean look papa john's had very (16:44 - 16:48)
mediocre pizza and then we couldn't eat (16:46 - 16:50)
at papa john's anymore because that guy (16:48 - 16:51)
was out of control and then they kicked (16:50 - 16:53)
papa john's off the team and then you (16:51 - 16:54)
went back to papa john's because you (16:53 - 16:55)
were like he's out (16:54 - 16:57)
papa john's is good again and then you (16:55 - 16:59)
ate their pizza and you're like (16:57 - 17:03)
nah never mind went back to papa john's (16:59 - 17:05)
it's like saying i went back to little (17:03 - 17:06)
caesars oh no (17:05 - 17:09)
you always going back never go back (17:06 - 17:11)
these little caesars you get exactly (17:09 - 17:14)
what you're paying for (17:11 - 17:17)
five dollars pizza that is bad (17:14 - 17:21)
i cannot listen to you talk about you (17:17 - 17:25)
you hot box like her oh (17:21 - 17:28)
incredible oh you people are terrible (17:25 - 17:30)
you had a little caesars deep dish (17:28 - 17:32)
because it's genuinely good (17:30 - 17:35)
i i the fact that you have to qualify it (17:32 - 17:37)
to a very specific product to be (17:35 - 17:39)
genuinely good (17:37 - 17:41)
every little caesars i have ever had has (17:39 - 17:43)
been absolutely wonderful and delicious (17:41 - 17:45)
i will caveat that the only time i have (17:43 - 17:47)
little caesars is typically when i've (17:45 - 17:48)
been driving for six hours straight and (17:47 - 17:50)
haven't eaten anything during that (17:48 - 17:51)
entire time (17:50 - 17:54)
but it's still fantastic hunger is the (17:51 - 17:55)
best spice (17:54 - 17:58)
true i heard that at a convention one (17:55 - 17:59)
time what (17:58 - 18:00)
what about their breadsticks their (17:59 - 18:02)
breadsticks are look you're (18:00 - 18:05)
the breadsticks dude as i since okay you (18:02 - 18:07)
fall in the same category as my husband (18:05 - 18:09)
i tell my husband he is no longer (18:07 - 18:10)
allowed (18:09 - 18:12)
to comment on spicy things because his (18:10 - 18:14)
taste buds have been ruined by spice (18:12 - 18:17)
you are no longer allowed to talk about (18:14 - 18:17)
bread things (18:17 - 18:20)
because all you eat is bread you no (18:17 - 18:21)
longer can differentiate bread you've (18:20 - 18:24)
eaten too much bread (18:21 - 18:24)
i love bread i'm gonna get we gotta get (18:24 - 18:29)
steve into uh into an ethiopian (18:27 - 18:31)
restaurant that'll destroy his love of (18:29 - 18:32)
bread right there (18:31 - 18:33)
right here's the question here's the (18:32 - 18:34)
question here's the question yes here's (18:33 - 18:35)
the answer here's the answer (18:34 - 18:38)
unites the unites dropping on uh (18:35 - 18:39)
wednesday (18:38 - 18:43)
yep are we putting money into it no no (18:39 - 18:46)
oh okay rewind (18:43 - 18:50)
it back it up back okay (18:46 - 18:52)
when pokemon pokemon go came out five (18:50 - 18:54)
years ago happy five year anniversary go (18:52 - 18:55)
fest was incredible (18:54 - 18:57)
boy that made it i couldn't believe that (18:55 - 18:59)
was so i caught the (18:57 - 19:02)
i caught the the thing i wanted and ah (18:59 - 19:02)
the (19:02 - 19:06)
uh wow when (19:02 - 19:10)
pokemon go came out (19:06 - 19:11)
what was what was your thought process (19:10 - 19:13)
of the money there do you remember (19:11 - 19:14)
because i remember i remember the like (19:13 - 19:15)
when it came out (19:14 - 19:18)
the hype was high there wasn't there's a (19:15 - 19:20)
lot of things to buy in the store now (19:18 - 19:21)
but there you know there wasn't a lot (19:20 - 19:23)
initially there were some clothes (19:21 - 19:27)
there was storage there was bag space (19:23 - 19:30)
um there was pokeballs of course uh (19:27 - 19:32)
but did you guys drop money right away (19:30 - 19:35)
on that no over my dead body was how i (19:32 - 19:38)
approached all mobile spending over my (19:35 - 19:39)
dead body and i have (19:38 - 19:42)
literally (19:39 - 19:42)
no white knuckled paid for the things (19:42 - 19:47)
that i paid for and go (19:45 - 19:50)
i think the only thing like that i first (19:47 - 19:53)
ever paid for ingo and i will remind you (19:50 - 19:54)
not emmett (19:53 - 19:57)
just ingo uh that i wouldn't even pick a (19:54 - 19:59)
team (19:57 - 20:01)
correct pokemon go correct all right (19:59 - 20:03)
until i was absolutely forced (20:01 - 20:06)
to yes i did not buy (20:03 - 20:10)
anything in pokemon go until niantic (20:06 - 20:14)
sent me a apology credit (20:10 - 20:17)
oh yeah i then used to buy (20:14 - 20:20)
extra storage space i'm dying on this (20:17 - 20:22)
hill that first go fest was (20:20 - 20:25)
one incredible two we all walked away (20:22 - 20:26)
with a hundred dollars (20:25 - 20:29)
in game of currency which you could also (20:26 - 20:30)
give the other half of that statement (20:29 - 20:33)
in that we got free passes and we still (20:30 - 20:35)
got the hundred dollar credit as an (20:33 - 20:36)
apology yeah we did (20:35 - 20:39)
we did (20:36 - 20:39)
i i put (20:39 - 20:46)
i did the i think i think the first week (20:43 - 20:47)
of (20:46 - 20:50)
pokemon go i put 20 in (20:47 - 20:52)
because i wanted to like buy some (20:50 - 20:53)
clothes i wanted to (20:52 - 20:56)
you know report on it properly because (20:53 - 20:58)
we did like we did like six or seven (20:56 - 20:59)
episodes of (20:58 - 21:03)
go when it came out and then i think (20:59 - 21:07)
yeah before before greg was on and then (21:03 - 21:08)
i think i ended up liking it so much (21:07 - 21:10)
that first week then i did the 100 (21:08 - 21:15)
purchase and i think that's all i spent (21:10 - 21:15)
like almost all the way to the like go (21:15 - 21:19)
fest (21:18 - 21:22)
which was like a year later um and the (21:19 - 21:24)
reason i did the hundred was because i (21:22 - 21:25)
did the math of like (21:24 - 21:28)
max poke storage max bag space was (21:25 - 21:29)
already like (21:28 - 21:31)
what sixty dollars if you wanted to max (21:29 - 21:32)
the two of those (21:31 - 21:35)
or something like that uh so i don't (21:32 - 21:36)
know what the currency situation i have (21:35 - 21:38)
no clue how much a costume costs in (21:36 - 21:39)
unite i don't think they revealed that (21:38 - 21:40)
yet (21:39 - 21:43)
um but we know they're gonna launch with (21:40 - 21:46)
the three costume sets the (21:43 - 21:48)
the pirates dad garchomp the like news (21:46 - 21:49)
boy (21:48 - 21:51)
talonflame and whatever the other the (21:49 - 21:53)
pirate is a pirate (21:51 - 21:55)
they've got my money i'm buying the (21:53 - 21:58)
talonflame out (21:55 - 22:00)
no i'm not super into pirates but i (21:58 - 22:02)
think i do want to and we don't even (22:00 - 22:04)
know what they're charging for like (22:02 - 22:05)
character customization because the (22:04 - 22:07)
character custom mission looks really (22:05 - 22:08)
good in the game (22:07 - 22:11)
um but i don't mind i've never had a (22:08 - 22:12)
problem buying like cosmetic (22:11 - 22:14)
cosmetics and stuff especially for a (22:12 - 22:16)
game that's free and especially if i'm (22:14 - 22:17)
sinking time into it i've never had a (22:16 - 22:18)
problem with that (22:17 - 22:21)
i'm just very curious what the you (22:18 - 22:24)
like in a packs i never have purchased a (22:21 - 22:25)
character with real money (22:24 - 22:28)
because i played so much apex that i had (22:25 - 22:29)
the currency to just unlock the (22:28 - 22:31)
characters which i'm assuming unite will (22:29 - 22:32)
have you either pay it (22:31 - 22:33)
up front or you just grind it out for a (22:32 - 22:35)
week and then you unlock it (22:33 - 22:39)
um i'd i'd wager to bet like cramer is (22:35 - 22:40)
probably gonna be (22:39 - 22:43)
either pay or (22:40 - 22:47)
grind out the currency um i'm as good (22:43 - 22:48)
because i'm gonna assume all the (22:47 - 22:50)
characters they showed are just not all (22:48 - 22:52)
free (22:50 - 22:52)
and cramarant is an expert character not (22:52 - 22:57)
like an easy or a beginner character so (22:55 - 22:58)
i'm just saying (22:57 - 23:01)
that cramer is locked but who knows (22:58 - 23:03)
uh i don't i don't mind giving like 20 (23:01 - 23:05)
bucks up front if i get a week's worth (23:03 - 23:06)
of enjoyment then i decide i don't like (23:05 - 23:08)
the game (23:06 - 23:10)
i've spent money on worse things (23:08 - 23:11)
everything (23:10 - 23:14)
behind me proves that (23:11 - 23:18)
i don't know i i don't like (23:14 - 23:18)
don't like i don't like the free-to-play (23:19 - 23:22)
model (23:22 - 23:26)
and i i i need to be like (23:22 - 23:29)
really invest like cosmetics world of (23:26 - 23:30)
warcraft (23:29 - 23:34)
killed my bi cosmetic things (23:30 - 23:37)
uh because it just it all became like (23:34 - 23:40)
when i left the game i'm like well (23:37 - 23:42)
nobody really cared what it looked like (23:40 - 23:44)
except for me yeah (23:42 - 23:46)
and i was just spending money on me for (23:44 - 23:47)
no good reason (23:46 - 23:51)
so why am i doing this uh i mean unite (23:47 - 23:52)
might be a little different because i'd (23:51 - 23:53)
be playing with other people (23:52 - 23:56)
who might want to make sure that i'm the (23:53 - 23:58)
right alolan nine tails and not somebody (23:56 - 23:59)
else's but i (23:58 - 24:02)
it they would it has to be very very (23:59 - 24:03)
very very (24:02 - 24:05)
very good for me to think oh i'm going (24:03 - 24:07)
to put money into this (24:05 - 24:09)
i think it's going to go i was going to (24:07 - 24:10)
say i think it's going to go one of two (24:09 - 24:12)
ways for me either (24:10 - 24:15)
i'm going to hate it and walk away and (24:12 - 24:15)
not (24:15 - 24:18)
play it me (24:15 - 24:21)
trevor chase marshall and chris are (24:18 - 24:22)
going to have a team i'm going to buy (24:21 - 24:24)
the battle pass (24:22 - 24:26)
i'm going to be all in every friday (24:24 - 24:27)
night's going to be unite night (24:26 - 24:30)
and we're just going to grind you see (24:27 - 24:31)
how he cut us out of that (24:30 - 24:35)
i did i want good players excuse me (24:31 - 24:38)
okay greg which moba do you play weekly (24:35 - 24:40)
unite (24:38 - 24:44)
i mean currently none (24:40 - 24:47)
exactly and steve i qualified for (24:44 - 24:48)
players cup too (24:47 - 24:51)
that's not a moba you don't know that (24:48 - 24:53)
this mobile will be like any of the (24:51 - 24:53)
others (24:53 - 24:56)
i it doesn't matter it's the fundamental (24:53 - 24:57)
concepts (24:56 - 25:00)
that my boys have the fundamental (24:57 - 25:01)
concepts down and this is just an (25:00 - 25:03)
adaptation to what they already know (25:01 - 25:05)
this is you know this is the story you (25:03 - 25:08)
don't even know who the jungler is (25:05 - 25:11)
i don't even know what that was exactly (25:08 - 25:12)
all right so steve and i are going to (25:11 - 25:14)
form our other team and then it's gonna (25:12 - 25:16)
be the underdog story when we crush (25:14 - 25:20)
will's dreams and hopes finally it'll be (25:16 - 25:23)
the greatest moment of my life the (25:20 - 25:25)
good luck i've got a documentary you can (25:23 - 25:28)
watch it's a dota documentary but (25:25 - 25:32)
called how i crushed it (25:28 - 25:36)
his teammate dumped him and went for (25:32 - 25:37)
another team and he came back around and (25:36 - 25:39)
won the world championships congrats (25:37 - 25:43)
i have given niantic this feedback (25:39 - 25:47)
i think that myself and maybe a vast (25:43 - 25:49)
amount of other players (25:47 - 25:52)
would probably buy more cosmetics in (25:49 - 25:53)
pokemon go if the (25:52 - 25:58)
characters didn't look so bad (25:53 - 26:01)
and in at least in the 45 second (25:58 - 26:03)
one minute trailer or whatever they (26:01 - 26:05)
showed today the characters (26:03 - 26:07)
customization in unite looks (26:05 - 26:10)
awesome it looks like the characters (26:07 - 26:10)
have (26:10 - 26:12)
like depth it doesn't look like the (26:10 - 26:14)
clothes are are (26:12 - 26:17)
p and g's like doesn't look like the (26:14 - 26:19)
clothes are clipping through each other (26:17 - 26:22)
um and and i hope (26:19 - 26:25)
that you uh niantic i mean there's other (26:22 - 26:27)
things niantic probably should fix like (26:25 - 26:28)
i i know there would probably be players (26:27 - 26:30)
very happy if (26:28 - 26:32)
the character customization and go was (26:30 - 26:33)
like better (26:32 - 26:34)
but there are probably other things they (26:33 - 26:36)
should fix first we all know (26:34 - 26:38)
your number one feedback to niantic was (26:36 - 26:39)
people would buy (26:38 - 26:41)
more customizations for the characters (26:39 - 26:43)
if they could wear socks (26:41 - 26:45)
yep oh yeah i mean we're still we're (26:43 - 26:47)
five years out zero size (26:45 - 26:50)
zero socks zero socks for the men (26:47 - 26:55)
i have such a hard time buying (26:50 - 26:55)
cosmetics any because i barely look at (26:55 - 26:58)
other players (26:58 - 27:01)
like the amount of time that i interact (26:58 - 27:02)
with (27:01 - 27:05)
that opening gift screen is a half a (27:02 - 27:07)
second (27:05 - 27:09)
i like looking at other players i like (27:07 - 27:10)
how my character looks and i tend to (27:09 - 27:12)
notice stuff yeah (27:10 - 27:15)
but yeah it's kind of like the owl in uh (27:12 - 27:17)

finally saw a picture of that'll be (31:09 - 31:12)
october 22nd (31:10 - 31:14)
the ultra premium collection october (31:12 - 31:15)
22nd (31:14 - 31:17)
and then the celebration collector's (31:15 - 31:19)
chest that's usually the little lunch (31:17 - 31:20)
box (31:19 - 31:22)
um those are also a scam uh and that (31:20 - 31:24)
just says october that doesn't actually (31:22 - 31:26)
happen (31:24 - 31:29)
so that's everything that's coming and (31:26 - 31:30)
then (31:29 - 31:33)
kotaku write an article here that says (31:30 - 31:37)
new pokemon cards show 25 pikachu drawn (31:33 - 31:38)
by 25 different (31:37 - 31:42)
artists and that's the v (31:38 - 31:44)
union card so we talked about v union i (31:42 - 31:45)
want to say two or three weeks ago and (31:44 - 31:46)
we talked about how (31:45 - 31:48)
it kind of seems it's it's just like an (31:46 - 31:50)
updated legends legends there was two (31:48 - 31:52)
halves you needed like top half of ho oh (31:50 - 31:55)
top bottom half of oh no one like (31:52 - 31:57)
they were kind of competitive but not (31:55 - 31:59)
really like they (31:57 - 32:00)
you could make them work but they were (31:59 - 32:02)
just better decks instead and these are (32:00 - 32:04)
four cards (32:02 - 32:06)
and the thought process is like man if (32:04 - 32:08)
you're a kid or even adult getting into (32:06 - 32:10)
pokemon cards and you're like i just got (32:08 - 32:12)
like mewtwo's thigh (32:10 - 32:13)
what am i doing with this like that's (32:12 - 32:15)
not super exciting but they did say that (32:13 - 32:16)
the v (32:15 - 32:19)
union cards will come in special sets (32:16 - 32:20)
yeah so you're not going to like (32:19 - 32:24)
pull mewtwo's left thigh from a booster (32:20 - 32:25)
pack you're gonna have to buy (32:24 - 32:26)
a specific set together you're gonna (32:25 - 32:28)
have to buy mewtwo's love ice (32:26 - 32:32)
yeah typically off trolling toad so the (32:28 - 32:35)
v union pikachu cards are (32:32 - 32:39)
part of this generations collection (32:35 - 32:43)
and the four p four cards making up 25 (32:39 - 32:45)
pikachus is really really cool (32:43 - 32:48)
i think it's just like um it's hard to (32:45 - 32:49)
explain it but it's just different art (32:48 - 32:51)
styles of pikachu and like (32:49 - 32:53)
there are a lot of different pikachu but (32:51 - 32:56)
what is missing is derpychoo (32:53 - 32:59)
look in the lower left-hand card right (32:56 - 33:00)
in the center (32:59 - 33:03)
that's pretty derpy we have a very (33:00 - 33:06)
specific derpy chew that i'm looking for (33:03 - 33:09)
straight from japan and it's not in (33:06 - 33:12)
there uh there will also be (33:09 - 33:14)
uh there'll also be flying pikachu (33:12 - 33:16)
surfing pikachu and an updated version (33:14 - 33:17)
of the very first pikachu by the (33:16 - 33:18)
original artist (33:17 - 33:23)
of uh missouri hero (33:18 - 33:23)
r got there (33:23 - 33:29)
i think i got there and true let me know (33:26 - 33:32)
hey you didn't man mitsuhiro (33:29 - 33:35)
arita yes that's how i said i said arita (33:32 - 33:38)
you said mitsurito oh i'm sorry i was (33:35 - 33:39)
more focused than the last night (33:38 - 33:40)
transcribed the (33:39 - 33:44)
s and the u there mitsuhiro (33:40 - 33:46)
uh what we're gonna say well uh just (33:44 - 33:47)
that it's a little disappointing because (33:46 - 33:48)
i know (33:47 - 33:51)
some people in the pokemon celebrations (33:48 - 33:52)
were really (33:51 - 33:55)
excited for the like oh they're bringing (33:52 - 33:56)
back this old (33:55 - 33:59)
funky mechanic from like the heart gold (33:56 - 34:00)
soul silver era (33:59 - 34:03)
and stuff like but like the the dragon (34:00 - 34:04)
pulp prime (34:03 - 34:06)
it literally says on the card not cannot (34:04 - 34:08)
be used in official tournaments (34:06 - 34:12)
yeah that's really disappointing yeah (34:08 - 34:14)
the cool thing about the flying and (34:12 - 34:16)
surfing pikachu i mean (34:14 - 34:18)
if you for whatever reason if no one (34:16 - 34:20)
knows the history of like the flying and (34:18 - 34:21)
surfing pikachu that was like from the (34:20 - 34:24)
original pokemon yellow (34:21 - 34:26)
and in let's go pikachu let's go eevee (34:24 - 34:28)
they turned those into like the hm's (34:26 - 34:29)
which is really cool (34:28 - 34:33)
um but the cool thing about these flying (34:29 - 34:35)
and surfing pikachus (34:33 - 34:39)
is if you look at the artwork the boat (34:35 - 34:41)
on the surfing pikachu and the plane on (34:39 - 34:44)
the flying pikachu are the same boat and (34:41 - 34:44)
plane (34:44 - 34:47)
in giganta max garbodor (34:44 - 34:50)
stuck in his body (34:47 - 34:53)
[Music] (34:50 - 34:56)
so classic game free copying and pasting (34:53 - 34:57)
they can't even (34:56 - 35:00)
come up with that boat design (34:57 - 35:04)
oh my gosh (35:00 - 35:04)
find the unite haters bring them back (35:04 - 35:08)
time to burn it all down (35:06 - 35:11)
burn it down it's really really cool (35:08 - 35:12)
it's i i i like it (35:11 - 35:14)
they become copy paste and when does (35:12 - 35:18)
something become an easter egg (35:14 - 35:20)
when it's good it's an easter egg okay (35:18 - 35:22)
when it's bad it's cocky (35:20 - 35:24)
we'll know in five years when they do a (35:22 - 35:25)
new pokemon game and they'll take the (35:24 - 35:27)
same tree texture and sword and shield (35:25 - 35:28)
and they'll (35:27 - 35:31)
reuse it remember these (35:28 - 35:34)
throwback trees why does that tree look (35:31 - 35:36)
so bad it's an easter egg (35:34 - 35:38)
it's an easter egg wow i remember how (35:36 - 35:40)
bad these look (35:38 - 35:42)
these trees look back in my day now they (35:40 - 35:44)
aged like fine wine (35:42 - 35:46)
uh there will be a reissue of the first (35:44 - 35:48)
charizard card as well (35:46 - 35:50)
uh they've yeah great let's ruin the (35:48 - 35:51)
market again (35:50 - 35:54)
yeah yeah that i'm a little worried a (35:51 - 35:55)
little bit more (35:54 - 35:58)
we'll see (35:55 - 36:00)
anyways this set looks really great uh (35:58 - 36:01)
but we (36:00 - 36:03)
we have until october before it comes (36:01 - 36:06)
out yeah we got a while (36:03 - 36:06)
final bit of news is off the silf road (36:06 - 36:13)
their website not their subreddit their (36:10 - 36:16)
website yeah (36:13 - 36:21)
the silfroad.com um (36:16 - 36:24)
so they have figured out (36:21 - 36:27)
it only took them five years science (36:24 - 36:28)
greg (36:27 - 36:31)
science science experimentation (36:28 - 36:34)
so they'd last week we had jay witz with (36:31 - 36:34)
5 (36:34 - 36:37)
000 twitter participants this week we (36:34 - 36:39)
cannot cover your fruitlessness again go (36:37 - 36:39)
to (36:39 - 36:42)
actual potential science this week we (36:39 - 36:42)
have over (36:42 - 36:47)
6 500 throws to test (36:42 - 36:51)
this theory uh theory (36:47 - 36:54)
uh hypothesis thesis (36:51 - 36:57)
okay i'll just there's a lot of math (36:54 - 36:58)
here and (36:57 - 36:59)
there's an audio podcast we're gonna (36:58 - 37:01)
skip past that math we're gonna go right (36:59 - 37:03)
to the results (37:01 - 37:05)
researchers i like how they call (37:03 - 37:07)
themselves researchers uh (37:05 - 37:11)
researchers like like that's a title (37:07 - 37:14)
that you get bestowed upon no until you (37:11 - 37:16)
get this white lab coat you shall not (37:14 - 37:19)
call myself a researcher (37:16 - 37:21)
they i they had you know for all six (37:19 - 37:22)
thousand throws i've heard they (37:21 - 37:24)
had to do it in the lab coat in order (37:22 - 37:26)
for them otherwise it doesn't count (37:24 - 37:28)
right right you have to control for (37:26 - 37:29)
every variable (37:28 - 37:32)
clothing could affect the outcome (37:29 - 37:34)
clothing could affect how you throw your (37:32 - 37:35)
premier ball (37:34 - 37:37)
make sure the lab coat is out get in the (37:35 - 37:40)
lab coat or quit now fraud (37:37 - 37:42)
researchers threw premier balls at raid (37:40 - 37:44)
bosses and recording everything that is (37:42 - 37:46)
known to affect the catch rate see (37:44 - 37:49)
back see thing above we're skipping that (37:46 - 37:52)
and whether the boss was captured or not (37:49 - 37:54)
missed throws were were also recorded a (37:52 - 37:55)
final (37:54 - 37:58)
hidden multiplier was left as a free (37:55 - 38:01)
parameter and we optimized it as (37:58 - 38:04)
optimize its value such as the expected (38:01 - 38:05)
catches (38:04 - 38:08)
from the formula equal the number of (38:05 - 38:09)
catches our researchers (38:08 - 38:12)
actually reported a hidden multiplier (38:09 - 38:12)
value (38:12 - 38:15)
of 1 would indicate that the catch rate (38:12 - 38:17)
formula is accurately predicting the (38:15 - 38:18)
catch results while (38:17 - 38:21)
a value greater than one would indicate (38:18 - 38:21)
that the (38:21 - 38:23)
encounters are easier to catch than the (38:21 - 38:25)
formula predicts (38:23 - 38:28)
we split the data into a first ball (38:25 - 38:28)
thrown (38:28 - 38:31)
second ball thrown third ball thrown etc (38:28 - 38:32)
and found that it best fit the (38:31 - 38:34)
multiplier for each subset (38:32 - 38:38)
optimized multiplier values with a 95 (38:34 - 38:41)
confidence interval and they are shown (38:38 - 38:42)
below (38:41 - 38:46)
so with that being said they're the (38:42 - 38:48)
hidden multiplier (38:46 - 38:50)
okay so i'll explain this for audio (38:48 - 38:51)
people there's (38:50 - 38:53)
you know how there's a graph like (38:51 - 38:54)
imagine stocks (38:53 - 38:55)
i like how he says i'll explain that for (38:54 - 38:57)
the audio people and then he starts (38:55 - 38:58)
using his hands (38:57 - 39:01)
yeah good job good job (38:58 - 39:05)
x and y axis okay and then zygarde shows (39:01 - 39:06)
up (39:05 - 39:08)
no this is okay these are actual terms (39:06 - 39:09)
there's a chart term there's an (39:08 - 39:12)
x and y axis so there's a hidden (39:09 - 39:13)
multiplier of one two three (39:12 - 39:15)
and then there's number of throws your (39:13 - 39:16)
first ball your second ball your third (39:15 - 39:17)
ball (39:16 - 39:19)
and two three is on the x-axis one (39:17 - 39:21)
through ten is on the y-axis (39:19 - 39:23)
okay i'll accept i'll accept and what (39:21 - 39:24)
it's what it's pretty much saying (39:23 - 39:28)
is your third fourth fifth and sixth (39:24 - 39:29)
ball (39:28 - 39:31)
have an increased catch rate compared to (39:29 - 39:32)
your first (39:31 - 39:35)
two throws and then it for whatever (39:32 - 39:37)
reason dips down so your seventh ball is (39:35 - 39:40)
less effective than the fifth and six (39:37 - 39:40)
but then it (39:40 - 39:42)
jumps back up on your eighth ball so (39:40 - 39:44)
your eighth ball will be (39:42 - 39:46)
likely more successful than your seventh (39:44 - 39:47)
ball and then it jumps (39:46 - 39:50)
way up for the ninth ball where the (39:47 - 39:50)
ninth ball (39:50 - 39:54)
thrown seems to be your best catch rate (39:50 - 39:57)
ever and then it dips back down at your (39:54 - 39:59)
tenth ball (39:57 - 40:02)
and people speculated this for a long (39:59 - 40:03)
time (40:02 - 40:05)
because at least i've noticed this (40:03 - 40:07)
although this could be uh (40:05 - 40:09)
specious reasoning but i've always (40:07 - 40:10)
noticed that (40:09 - 40:13)
i caught a lot of legendary pokemon on (40:10 - 40:14)
my last ball (40:13 - 40:16)
i think almost every single one of my (40:14 - 40:18)
mewtwos i either caught (40:16 - 40:20)
like i i remember catching almost all of (40:18 - 40:22)
them in the very last ball (40:20 - 40:25)
but that would line up with this 6500 (40:22 - 40:29)
tests that they did that there is (40:25 - 40:33)
something to say that the more balls (40:29 - 40:35)
that are thrown the higher (40:33 - 40:37)
chance you have to catch well it's it's (40:35 - 40:38)
a curve there is (40:37 - 40:42)
a defined curve of success rate (40:38 - 40:44)
depending on which ball number you are (40:42 - 40:46)
tossing (40:44 - 40:48)
which does not explain why i have never (40:46 - 40:49)
caught any (40:48 - 40:54)
legendary ever (40:49 - 40:54)
no matter how many balls i threw at it (40:54 - 40:58)
there were 36 different people who (40:59 - 41:04)
helped research this (41:01 - 41:06)
but 14 of them really provided the most (41:04 - 41:08)
data (41:06 - 41:12)
kind of where's the control group (41:08 - 41:12)
so i mean so basically what they're (41:16 - 41:20)
saying is you're more likely to catch (41:17 - 41:22)
the raid boss on the tenth encounter the (41:20 - 41:24)
tenth row (41:22 - 41:26)
ninth ball but that's what the they say (41:24 - 41:27)
in their own thing (41:26 - 41:30)
in bold you are more likely to cast the (41:27 - 41:31)
raid boss (41:30 - 41:33)
on the tenth throw of the encounter than (41:31 - 41:35)
the first that's not the stats that (41:33 - 41:37)
steve just read to us i know (41:35 - 41:39)
so like they have it on the ninth but (41:37 - 41:40)
the thing says the tenth (41:39 - 41:42)
no you're a lot more likely to catch it (41:40 - 41:44)
on the tenth throw compared to the first (41:42 - 41:45)
throw (41:44 - 41:47)
oh okay but still ninth is your best of (41:45 - 41:48)
them all yes (41:47 - 41:51)
ninth is your highest chance right but (41:48 - 41:52)
you know what (41:51 - 41:55)
they also suggest like i don't know (41:52 - 41:57)
i shouldn't say this although i'm going (41:55 - 41:58)
to say it i don't know who only has like (41:57 - 42:01)
three golden raspberries in their bag (41:58 - 42:02)
but this is coming from somebody who has (42:01 - 42:05)
like 200 uh same (42:02 - 42:07)
but i suppose if you only had like three (42:05 - 42:08)
golden raspberries you would (42:07 - 42:11)
ideally want to save it for the last (42:08 - 42:13)
like if you only have three (42:11 - 42:15)
and you have 10 balls then you're better (42:13 - 42:17)
off saving your golden razz for eight (42:15 - 42:18)
nine and ten (42:17 - 42:20)
than using them on one two three um (42:18 - 42:22)
that's actually the probably the good (42:20 - 42:24)
information for people who (42:22 - 42:26)
uh you know don't have a lot of (42:24 - 42:28)
resources right compared to (42:26 - 42:29)
you know me i'm just to use a golden (42:28 - 42:31)
raspberry every time no (42:29 - 42:33)
you got to alternate between nana bees (42:31 - 42:34)
and golden houses (42:33 - 42:37)
alternatives settle down and then there (42:34 - 42:38)
you go (42:37 - 42:41)
previously we were very limited in the (42:38 - 42:43)
amount of (42:41 - 42:46)
balls that you would get and now it's i (42:43 - 42:48)
think it's not that uncommon that i end (42:46 - 42:49)
up with like (42:48 - 42:52)
16 to 18 chances (42:49 - 42:54)
do we think this continues at this (42:52 - 42:56)
relative rate past the 10th or (42:54 - 42:59)
do we think they just say at the 10th (42:56 - 43:02)
it's the same or it goes down (42:59 - 43:04)
like they don't touch on now that we get (43:02 - 43:06)
a lot more throws because of (43:04 - 43:10)
time bonuses and other bonuses yeah (43:06 - 43:12)
they'll have to redo the study well i (43:10 - 43:13)
mean we need another research (43:12 - 43:15)
institution to replicate the study (43:13 - 43:17)
we need somebody else we need (43:15 - 43:18)
competition of the self-road is that (43:17 - 43:18)
where (43:18 - 43:20)
it's not competition it's not (43:18 - 43:21)
competition it's verification the (43:20 - 43:23)
research needs to be (43:21 - 43:25)
replicable to be valid and we need a (43:23 - 43:28)
non-affiliated party to take on the (43:25 - 43:29)
research task (43:28 - 43:33)
i nominate what's somebody we don't like (43:29 - 43:36)
nine out of ten ten dentists agree it's (43:33 - 43:37)
easier to catch (43:36 - 43:41)
nine out of ten dentists agree (43:37 - 43:43)
did uh i think we talked about this (43:41 - 43:44)
either but i think it's (43:43 - 43:46)
it's it's been pretty solidified also by (43:44 - 43:47)
the self road that (43:46 - 43:50)
i i know like two years ago or maybe (43:47 - 43:51)
three years ago we talked about how like (43:50 - 43:52)
the shiny rate in (43:51 - 43:57)
pogo is like one in 450 or around there (43:52 - 43:59)
um i the sulfur road has kind of moved (43:57 - 44:02)
it to it's just one in 512 (43:59 - 44:04)
which makes sense because that's (44:02 - 44:05)
literally (44:04 - 44:07)
like one of the main numbers they have (44:05 - 44:08)
used in the main series game all the (44:07 - 44:09)
time (44:08 - 44:11)
but they they're more confident now that (44:09 - 44:14)
it's not one in 450 that it's actually (44:11 - 44:18)
one in 512 which is the same as masuda (44:14 - 44:21)
yeah which (44:18 - 44:24)
might make sense (44:21 - 44:24)
keep them all the same line them all up (44:25 - 44:29)
well it also is in line with (44:27 - 44:32)
uh how memory is (44:29 - 44:35)
numbered in computers (44:32 - 44:39)
right like one gigabyte is 1024. (44:35 - 44:42)
it's not 1000. so 512 is half (44:39 - 44:46)
of 1024. (44:42 - 44:46)
so i thought that was interesting uh fun (44:48 - 44:52)
to talk about (44:51 - 44:55)
they are 95 sure i think when they (44:52 - 44:56)
released the like one in 450 i think (44:55 - 44:57)
they were (44:56 - 44:59)
i think they were only 90 sure on that (44:57 - 45:00)
number but (44:59 - 45:03)
now they are like closer to yeah it just (45:00 - 45:04)
seems like it's one in five twelve for (45:03 - 45:05)
more (45:04 - 45:07)
research is required yeah replicate the (45:05 - 45:08)
study (45:07 - 45:10)
sorry i'm sure we'll find out why it's (45:08 - 45:12)
always changing (45:10 - 45:14)
i'm sure we'll find out in five more (45:12 - 45:16)
years that it's (45:14 - 45:18)
only taken five years to get to this (45:16 - 45:20)
point we need a double-blind (45:18 - 45:23)
research study yeah replicable (45:20 - 45:27)
etc pokemon (45:23 - 45:30)
of the week no question of the week no (45:27 - 45:31)
questions i'm sorry (45:30 - 45:34)
question but also bobby sent in the uh (45:31 - 45:35)
silf road research (45:34 - 45:38)
al sent in the unite stuff although (45:35 - 45:40)

good girl would make a good (46:52 - 46:56)
cheap well we also have to not include (46:53 - 46:58)
bonslight or sudowoodo (46:56 - 47:00)

hate (52:00 - 52:02)
that's true that's true that's true and (52:01 - 52:04)
all of a sudden you've got a little (52:02 - 52:06)
family of spiders who said why this is (52:04 - 52:08)
just the perfect place for us to set up (52:06 - 52:08)

oh yeah it is a fantastic wonderful (52:42 - 52:46)
place to visit (52:45 - 52:49)
do not bring cacti into your home (52:46 - 52:50)
they're evil (52:49 - 52:52)
they they're out to kill you but i will (52:50 - 52:53)
tell you you never had an (52:52 - 52:55)
oddish plan i would give you more (52:53 - 52:58)
reasons why you don't want plants (52:55 - 53:01)
your cat is going to eat the plant and (52:58 - 53:02)
get sick (53:01 - 53:03)
yeah yeah i do i have to get my number (53:02 - 53:06)
two your cat is going to say (53:03 - 53:08)
i wonder what would happen if i knock (53:06 - 53:09)
this oddish planter (53:08 - 53:13)
over and sprew dirt right across that (53:09 - 53:14)
throw rug that (53:13 - 53:16)
brought your room so perfectly together (53:14 - 53:18)
i do have which you can't see because (53:16 - 53:21)
but that is a bubble sort planter (53:18 - 53:23)
right there i got the reason i pulled (53:21 - 53:24)
this question i almost forgot (53:23 - 53:28)
i so the pokemon center released their (53:24 - 53:30)
gardening set yes (53:28 - 53:32)
and i i post on tic tac and i post on (53:30 - 53:33)
instagram if you want to see it (53:32 - 53:37)
it is huge it is like (53:33 - 53:39)
two funko pops tall this is how we're (53:37 - 53:41)
this is how we're scaling things now (53:39 - 53:44)
the planters are the well it's not it's (53:41 - 53:44)
just a (53:44 - 53:46)
thing you put next to your plants (53:44 - 53:48)
there's some that are planters yeah (53:46 - 53:48)
there's (53:48 - 53:51)
some planters none of these you put dirt (53:48 - 53:52)
in their decorations (53:51 - 53:54)
oh they're gardens they're good things (53:52 - 53:56)
yeah i don't (53:54 - 53:59)
know if i don't trust putting it outside (53:56 - 54:01)
because i know some people like decorate (53:59 - 54:01)
their (54:01 - 54:06)
outside garden and then like i think (54:01 - 54:06)
i think the rain like if you had a (54:07 - 54:10)
strong enough rain i feel like the (54:08 - 54:12)
paint would come off it's not the rain (54:10 - 54:14)
it's the teenagers (54:12 - 54:17)
yeah they're designed to withstand (54:14 - 54:20)
being outside though these are designed (54:17 - 54:22)
to withstand (54:20 - 54:25)
they are they are i'll order another one (54:22 - 54:26)
i'll put one outside (54:25 - 54:28)
i'll put it into my security camera so (54:26 - 54:30)
when a kid comes and smashes it (54:28 - 54:32)
at least you have to have it in your (54:30 - 54:34)
backyard in your fenced backyard in your (54:32 - 54:40)
in your zen garden um (54:34 - 54:40)
because it was very you know they don't (54:41 - 54:45)
they don't do my boy justice (54:42 - 54:46)
they don't do enough love to miraculous (54:45 - 54:48)
i ordered the miraculous one it arrived (54:46 - 54:51)
very it's the same people it's in the (54:48 - 54:52)
same box (54:51 - 54:55)
in the same styrofoam as the other resin (54:52 - 54:56)
stuff (54:55 - 54:57)
[Music] (54:56 - 54:59)
but i would say the quality is better (54:57 - 55:00)
because it's (54:59 - 55:03)
bigger and they they don't like miss (55:00 - 55:04)
with the paint (55:03 - 55:07)
why didn't you get a planter one none of (55:04 - 55:08)
them are planters (55:07 - 55:10)
one of them no no no no no they have (55:08 - 55:12)
ones because i saw somebody comment yes (55:10 - 55:15)
like like yes the bulbasaur is a planter (55:12 - 55:16)
or something oh wait (55:15 - 55:18)
really yeah i looked at the bulbasaur (55:16 - 55:19)
and i was like oh you can't put dirt in (55:18 - 55:22)
it you just put it next to a plant (55:19 - 55:23)
but i don't want to buy that because (55:22 - 55:25)
then i got to put dirt in it oh like the (55:23 - 55:26)
charmander (55:25 - 55:30)
and the pikachu they've got big (55:26 - 55:32)
holes but do they have a hole in the (55:30 - 55:33)
inside (55:32 - 55:35)
like do you actually put oh that is a (55:33 - 55:37)
plant (55:35 - 55:42)
oh i didn't realize that (55:37 - 55:44)
oh maybe i will that is really cute (55:42 - 55:46)
statue features a small pot that can (55:44 - 55:48)
hold the plant of your choice plants not (55:46 - 55:49)
included (55:48 - 55:52)
yeah see when i was looking at the (55:49 - 55:54)
pictures i just thought it was like (55:52 - 55:56)
kind of fake (55:54 - 55:56)
because like it's got a little succulent (55:58 - 56:01)
because some of them some of them you (56:00 - 56:02)
just can't even put (56:01 - 56:04)
like the what i got the miraculous is (56:02 - 56:05)
just a miraculous there's no (56:04 - 56:07)
place to put plants some of them are for (56:05 - 56:09)
being put next to your plants some of (56:07 - 56:10)
them like the oddish (56:09 - 56:12)
you don't there's no room for a plant in (56:10 - 56:13)
there man (56:12 - 56:17)
i am looking at this hideous parade (56:13 - 56:20)
fiasco don't can't we don't have time to (56:17 - 56:23)
talk about it (56:20 - 56:23)
what's the youtube question do we have (56:23 - 56:26)
one yeah we do (56:24 - 56:29)
anyway bulbasaur has a pot you could put (56:26 - 56:32)
a plant in the bubble sort of sold out (56:29 - 56:35)
okay but the charmander one isn't yeah i (56:32 - 56:36)
would rather get the squirtle no i would (56:35 - 56:38)
rather get the pikachu but i think the (56:36 - 56:40)
pikachu one was so good (56:38 - 56:42)
before now it is now it is well the (56:40 - 56:44)
oddest one is super cute but they didn't (56:42 - 56:45)
put a plant next to it (56:44 - 56:48)
squirtle squirtle's got a pot yeah alex (56:45 - 56:49)
squirtle (56:48 - 56:51)
uh oddish is just a gardening statue (56:49 - 56:53)
this is honestly just (56:51 - 56:55)
also a statue yeah yeah but i will i (56:53 - 56:57)
will say for 25 bucks (56:55 - 57:00)
i think they're worth it i legit think (56:57 - 57:01)
they're (57:00 - 57:03)
the pokemon they're like if it wasn't (57:01 - 57:05)
pokemon it would probably be like 20 (57:03 - 57:05)
bucks (57:05 - 57:07)
like something you put in your yard like (57:05 - 57:09)
a gnome or a mushroom or something but (57:07 - 57:11)
uh these these are worth it i have a job (57:09 - 57:14)
while guarding them (57:11 - 57:14)
uh citizen 5101 from youtube says (57:17 - 57:23)
uh also if you're watching this on (57:21 - 57:24)
youtube we have a question the week (57:23 - 57:25)
every week (57:24 - 57:27)
feel free to like subscribe all that (57:25 - 57:28)
stuff (57:27 - 57:29)
with the release of monster hunter (57:28 - 57:30)
stories 2 there's been a lot of talk (57:29 - 57:32)
about this is what pokemon is missing (57:30 - 57:34)
or this is what sword and shield should (57:32 - 57:36)
have been not necessarily monster hunter (57:34 - 57:37)
stories 2 (57:36 - 57:38)
but what features of gameplay from (57:37 - 57:40)
another series do you think game freak (57:38 - 57:40)
should (57:40 - 57:43)
plagiarize in order i loved how they (57:40 - 57:43)
were than that (57:43 - 57:46)
in order to improve pokemon in future (57:43 - 57:47)
generations (57:46 - 57:49)
uh now i don't know if greg has played (57:47 - 57:50)
monster hunter stories too i know will (57:49 - 57:51)
plans on it i don't know if will has (57:50 - 57:53)
played i've been playing monster hunter (57:51 - 57:54)
stories too i play it every single day (57:53 - 57:55)
buddy (57:54 - 57:58)
so good it's exciting although i'm i'm (57:55 - 57:59)
grinding right now so i'm kind of (57:58 - 58:02)
i mean so off the story so let's start (57:59 - 58:03)
with greg what (58:02 - 58:04)
you watched me play what are your (58:03 - 58:06)
initial thoughts as a non-monster hunter (58:04 - 58:07)
fan (58:06 - 58:10)
i mean so it's it is basically what it (58:07 - 58:11)
seems to be (58:10 - 58:15)
is it a fairly live action (58:11 - 58:15)
it's turn-based it's 100 turn-based okay (58:16 - 58:27)
ah it doesn't it doesn't look (58:23 - 58:29)
all that impressive to me like it was (58:27 - 58:32)
like okay (58:29 - 58:32)
so i would say like specifically monster (58:32 - 58:38)
hunter stories too (58:36 - 58:41)
one thing that i really enjoy about (58:38 - 58:44)
which is probably one of the things i (58:41 - 58:45)
shouldn't enjoy about (58:44 - 58:48)
monster hunters as a series altogether (58:45 - 58:49)
is the (58:48 - 58:53)
randomization of rewards that you get (58:49 - 58:55)
so that you have to like you're driven (58:53 - 58:56)
to (58:55 - 58:58)
continually keep playing because it's (58:56 - 59:00)
like you want to build (58:58 - 59:02)
this one weapon you want to build this (59:00 - 59:03)
one outfit (59:02 - 59:06)
but you you never get the drop (59:03 - 59:08)
and the game eventually figures out (59:06 - 59:10)
which thing you're trying to go for and (59:08 - 59:11)
then it intentionally makes it harder (59:10 - 59:13)
and less likely to drop so you gotta be (59:11 - 59:15)
real sneaky it's called the desire (59:13 - 59:16)
sensor (59:15 - 59:19)
um so something like that in pokemon i (59:16 - 59:20)
don't know how they would implement it (59:19 - 59:20)
or (59:20 - 59:24)
like maybe like (59:20 - 59:27)
you uh i was like if you can (59:24 - 59:29)
do some sort of tasks you get a chance (59:27 - 59:31)
to battle but we've had that like battle (59:29 - 59:34)
of random pokemon and possibly capture (59:31 - 59:37)
uh a rare pokemon but you have to (59:34 - 59:40)
like keep you know attempting the same (59:37 - 59:41)
thing (59:40 - 59:42)
but there was the guy with the mansion (59:41 - 59:44)
and he kept saying he had pokemon in his (59:42 - 59:46)
backyard and they weren't really there (59:44 - 59:47)
and his butler would come and put it in (59:46 - 59:50)
his backyard (59:47 - 59:52)
so i remember that was like diamond and (59:50 - 59:54)
pearl or something it was diamond pearl (59:52 - 59:56)
the trophy garden yeah i love that i (59:54 - 59:58)
love that place (59:56 - 60:00)
so the thing about monster hunter (59:58 - 60:02)
stories 2 which i think (60:00 - 60:04)
is is is what pokemon is quote unquote (60:02 - 60:06)
missing (60:04 - 60:08)
uh and i guess i'm going to speak from (60:06 - 60:09)
my experience but i feel like (60:08 - 60:11)
you know from me streaming on twitch and (60:09 - 60:13)
talking to a lot of people (60:11 - 60:15)
and uh just having constant (60:13 - 60:16)
conversations about like what people (60:15 - 60:18)
want in pokemon or what people don't (60:16 - 60:19)
want or (60:18 - 60:20)
i would say that the people who watch on (60:19 - 60:22)
twitch are (60:20 - 60:25)
uh more hardcore than the people who (60:22 - 60:27)
you know they go into store they buy the (60:25 - 60:28)
game they play it and then they you know (60:27 - 60:30)
move on to the next game right true (60:28 - 60:31)
because they're going the extra length (60:30 - 60:33)
so waiting to watch somebody else play (60:31 - 60:35)
but i think sergeant shield kind of (60:33 - 60:37)
attempted this but then in retrospect (60:35 - 60:39)
failed and i think monster hunter (60:37 - 60:40)
stories does this better (60:39 - 60:44)
so and i don't know if it's because i've (60:40 - 60:45)
just played (60:44 - 60:47)
so many pokemon games but the general (60:45 - 60:48)
thought process (60:47 - 60:50)
is you start your pokemon game you pick (60:48 - 60:51)
your starter (60:50 - 60:53)
you get to the first route you catch (60:51 - 60:55)
something you get to the second route (60:53 - 60:56)
you catch something (60:55 - 60:58)
you battle the first gym leader and then (60:56 - 61:00)
the next route you catch something (60:58 - 61:03)
and on these routes you can opt to be (61:00 - 61:04)
like well i want to catch everything (61:03 - 61:06)
before i move on (61:04 - 61:08)
um and you or i want to battle everyone (61:06 - 61:09)
before i move on (61:08 - 61:11)
or i want to find like five hidden items (61:09 - 61:12)
on every route before i move on (61:11 - 61:15)
like that that does exist but by the (61:12 - 61:17)
time you get to the end of the game (61:15 - 61:21)
you have six pokemon some are from the (61:17 - 61:22)
earlier route (61:21 - 61:24)
some you might have found late game but (61:22 - 61:28)
i feel like for most players (61:24 - 61:28)
they go to the elite four with with six (61:28 - 61:33)
to maybe eight pokemon that are (61:31 - 61:35)
ready for the elite four and then (61:33 - 61:36)
everything else is just like (61:35 - 61:38)
filler that they caught or dex things (61:36 - 61:40)
that they caught and they moved on (61:38 - 61:44)
and with ma and so that doesn't really (61:40 - 61:48)
it doesn't really keep you on a route (61:44 - 61:49)
um you just kind of you're there and (61:48 - 61:51)
then you move to the next thing (61:49 - 61:53)
and that's fine like that's in in (61:51 - 61:54)
essence that's not (61:53 - 61:58)
bad but with stories (61:54 - 61:58)
and i have to paint the picture for (61:59 - 62:02)
stories monster hunter stories is a (62:00 - 62:03)
turn-based (62:02 - 62:05)
monster hunter game so it's not like the (62:03 - 62:07)
traditional action game (62:05 - 62:10)
and you be you befriend monsters and you (62:07 - 62:12)
have a party of six (62:10 - 62:14)
and you have monsters from the series (62:12 - 62:16)
that are in essence pokemon (62:14 - 62:19)
and they have different stats (62:16 - 62:22)
so a monster could have a rainbow stat (62:19 - 62:22)
would mean (62:22 - 62:24)
it's like really really rare and that's (62:22 - 62:26)
that's really really good or (62:24 - 62:29)
or the same monster one could be um (62:26 - 62:32)
a blue instead of a green (62:29 - 62:34)
and or it could be a red instead of a (62:32 - 62:35)
green and it's there's just the standard (62:34 - 62:37)
like rock paper scissors with the red (62:35 - 62:38)
blue green (62:37 - 62:42)
um so there's a variety (62:38 - 62:46)
of monsters there's a variety of the (62:42 - 62:48)
same monsters (62:46 - 62:51)
but with with stories i spent (62:48 - 62:53)
so much time before the like i'll just (62:51 - 62:55)
say like the second gym (62:53 - 62:57)
like the second boss battle because (62:55 - 62:59)
before the first boss battle before the (62:57 - 63:00)
second boss battle i was like i want to (62:59 - 63:02)
keep finding these eggs (63:00 - 63:03)
and i want to keep hatching these (63:02 - 63:05)
monsters because i want a monster of (63:03 - 63:08)
this with the rainbow gene (63:05 - 63:10)
and you could you could point to pokemon (63:08 - 63:11)
and you could be like oh well you could (63:10 - 63:13)
do that with brilliant pokemon (63:11 - 63:15)
and that brilliant pokemon has three (63:13 - 63:17)
perfect ivs which it does (63:15 - 63:19)
although the game doesn't show you that (63:17 - 63:20)
initially until you (63:19 - 63:24)
beat the game but that loop itself (63:20 - 63:28)
the loop of like i wanna hatch these (63:24 - 63:28)
eggs (63:28 - 63:31)
i know how to get these eggs when i go (63:28 - 63:33)
into this cave it's randomized (63:31 - 63:35)
at the end of the cave i have a chance (63:33 - 63:38)
for an egg and i can re-roll that chance (63:35 - 63:39)
because when you pick up an egg (63:38 - 63:41)
you can do this little gambling thing of (63:39 - 63:43)
like put the egg down and pick up a (63:41 - 63:44)
different egg (63:43 - 63:45)
and if you push to luck if you push it (63:44 - 63:47)
too far a monster will show up and fight (63:45 - 63:48)
you (63:47 - 63:51)
um but that loop of like i want to go (63:48 - 63:52)
out (63:51 - 63:55)
fi find a cave find a rare cave because (63:52 - 63:56)
they have like (63:55 - 63:59)
like gold caves that are like rarer i (63:56 - 64:00)
want to get an egg i want to bring it (63:59 - 64:02)
back i want to hatch it (64:00 - 64:04)
and then is it better than what i have (64:02 - 64:05)
and that (64:04 - 64:09)
like i have cycled through like probably (64:05 - 64:11)
50 some monsters (64:09 - 64:13)
and i'm not even at the like second gym (64:11 - 64:14)
and pokemon doesn't (64:13 - 64:18)
have that but but the reason that's good (64:14 - 64:19)
in monster hunter is because that loop (64:18 - 64:20)
is so (64:19 - 64:23)
fun like it's not really fun to like (64:20 - 64:26)
look for a brilliant pokemon (64:23 - 64:27)
although maybe a brilliant pokemon is (64:26 - 64:29)
like close to that but i think (64:27 - 64:31)
sword and shield kind of accomplished (64:29 - 64:33)
that with max raid battles (64:31 - 64:35)
where like it was hard for me to leave (64:33 - 64:37)
the wild area once i got there because i (64:35 - 64:38)
was like oh look at this one look at (64:37 - 64:39)
this one oh you have that one (64:38 - 64:43)
so it's like it's like close (64:39 - 64:45)
but i think that's i think that's what (64:43 - 64:48)
pokemon overall is missing (64:45 - 64:52)
is like this this this other loop (64:48 - 64:56)
that you can have um that makes it so (64:52 - 64:58)
good well like other activities you can (64:56 - 64:59)
do (64:58 - 65:01)
rather than at the beginning at the (64:59 - 65:02)
early part of the game (65:01 - 65:05)
rather than just collecting or battling (65:02 - 65:07)
your way through the game yeah you have (65:05 - 65:07)
like (65:07 - 65:09)
collect it you have collect all the (65:07 - 65:11)
pokemon battle all the pokemon push on (65:09 - 65:13)
with the story (65:11 - 65:16)
um but that weird egg slash (65:13 - 65:18)
find the den get the egg go hatch it is (65:16 - 65:20)
it better no it's not no big deal that (65:18 - 65:22)
was fun so i'm gonna do it again (65:20 - 65:25)
they just mastered that loop in stories (65:22 - 65:26)
and it's (65:25 - 65:28)
it's so like i'm 10 i'm 12 hours into (65:26 - 65:29)
stories (65:28 - 65:31)
i've probably gone through 50 different (65:29 - 65:33)
diff monsters not different like a lot (65:31 - 65:34)
of them like oh i got the same answer (65:33 - 65:36)
like eight times but this eighth one is (65:34 - 65:38)
better than the first seven so yeah we (65:36 - 65:40)
did it (65:38 - 65:42)
so i i want to revise my answer now that (65:40 - 65:44)
i've had a chance to think about it (65:42 - 65:47)
um a crafting mechanic would be awesome (65:44 - 65:50)
so we know in pokemon games we go out (65:47 - 65:51)
there especially (65:50 - 65:53)
sword and shield right there's little (65:51 - 65:55)
sparklies on the ground you pick stuff (65:53 - 65:59)
up what if they added in a thing (65:55 - 66:01)
where you could craft your own pokeballs (65:59 - 66:02)
to have (66:01 - 66:05)
like specific capture skills like (66:02 - 66:07)
oh you know because we already have (66:05 - 66:09)
pokeballs that are defined for capture (66:07 - 66:09)
skills (66:09 - 66:12)
let me make my own i want to craft a (66:09 - 66:13)
pokemon (66:12 - 66:15)
a pokeball that is really good at (66:13 - 66:16)
catching water pokemon i want (66:15 - 66:18)
one that's good at catching grass (66:16 - 66:21)
pokemon uh or i can combine the two and (66:18 - 66:23)
i'm like going for grass water pokemon (66:21 - 66:26)
um or you know like you get really real (66:23 - 66:27)
really rare items (66:26 - 66:29)
and it's just like even better than (66:27 - 66:30)
ultra ball (66:29 - 66:32)
catcher rate or something like that but (66:30 - 66:34)
like some sort of crafting mechanic so i (66:32 - 66:35)
can feel (66:34 - 66:37)
like i put in the work to make the (66:35 - 66:38)
pokeball (66:37 - 66:41)
that i wanted that was specific for (66:38 - 66:45)
capturing this particular pokemon (66:41 - 66:45)
another thing pokemon should copy from (66:45 - 66:50)
other jrpgs (66:47 - 66:52)
is the speed up mechanic like bravely (66:50 - 66:53)
default (66:52 - 66:55)
persona 5 monster hunter stories they (66:53 - 66:57)
all have it where you can like just (66:55 - 67:01)
increase the animation speed um (66:57 - 67:03)
so if you were in a situation where you (67:01 - 67:05)
wanted to grind or you just wanted to (67:03 - 67:06)
catch a bunch of (67:05 - 67:09)
crammer ant because you were hunting for (67:06 - 67:11)
a brilliant cramaran or a shining cramer (67:09 - 67:13)
ant it would just be nice to have like (67:11 - 67:14)
bravely like i said bravely default (67:13 - 67:16)
persona 5 monster understories there's (67:14 - 67:17)
probably more (67:16 - 67:19)
but you it just goes like times two or (67:17 - 67:21)
times three or times for the animation (67:19 - 67:25)
um i mean if we're pulling from (67:21 - 67:28)
other jrpgs (67:25 - 67:32)
i would like a job system in (67:28 - 67:36)
pokemon so that like it's not just (67:32 - 67:39)
other trainers but like you could list (67:36 - 67:40)
yourself as a breeder and that would (67:39 - 67:42)
give you an equivalent of an (67:40 - 67:45)
o power or you could be a ace trainer (67:42 - 67:47)
and that would give you a different set (67:45 - 67:48)
or (67:47 - 67:50)
a water type trainer that would give a (67:48 - 67:52)
boost to those things so that like (67:50 - 67:54)
every character isn't exactly the same (67:52 - 67:56)
like you can choose (67:54 - 67:59)
a specific job that you want to do (67:56 - 68:02)
in the pokemon world i think that would (67:59 - 68:03)
be (68:02 - 68:06)
a bonus to that game yeah (68:03 - 68:07)
i think i think sword and shield are (68:06 - 68:09)
great games i really really like them (68:07 - 68:10)
and i think like (68:09 - 68:12)
the co-op raid stuff is really fun yeah (68:10 - 68:13)
i think (68:12 - 68:15)
brilliant pokemon were like a step in (68:13 - 68:16)
the right direction (68:15 - 68:18)
because they do like when they pop up (68:16 - 68:19)
well when they popped up for the first (68:18 - 68:20)
time i was like whoa why is that one (68:19 - 68:21)
glowing (68:20 - 68:23)
like that's cool um like the trainer (68:21 - 68:24)
card keeping (68:23 - 68:26)
track of your stats and you being able (68:24 - 68:28)
to share that was like (68:26 - 68:30)
really cool but also super limited like (68:28 - 68:31)
show me how many eggs i've hatched or (68:30 - 68:32)
how many (68:31 - 68:35)
steps i've taken or how many battles (68:32 - 68:35)
i've done (68:35 - 68:37)
right monster hunter has that they have (68:35 - 68:38)
the guild cards but they've (68:37 - 68:40)
de-prioritized the guild cards which is (68:38 - 68:42)
kind of sad (68:40 - 68:46)
so i think they're getting there (68:42 - 68:49)
um but man stories two (68:46 - 68:53)
is one of the best sequels to any game (68:49 - 68:54)
i've ever played (68:53 - 68:57)
like they just they just learn so much (68:54 - 68:58)
and i would say stories one was a very (68:57 - 69:00)
average game as a huge monster hunter (68:58 - 69:02)
fan it wasn't like it wasn't a bad game (69:00 - 69:05)
but it wasn't like oh you've never (69:02 - 69:06)
played monster hunter you need to go get (69:05 - 69:08)
this it'll really get you into it it was (69:06 - 69:09)
like kind of hard to recommend it (69:08 - 69:10)
because it's like yeah it's (69:09 - 69:12)
it's fine like it's fun it's just not (69:10 - 69:14)
like a like a super stellar game (69:12 - 69:17)
but stories too holy cow that game is (69:14 - 69:18)
yeah the only problem with stories too (69:17 - 69:19)
is the trees (69:18 - 69:21)
man they took those trees straight out (69:19 - 69:22)
of sword and shield (69:21 - 69:25)
yeah just copy and paste and the 45 (69:22 - 69:26)
minute cut scene before you even get to (69:25 - 69:27)
start the game (69:26 - 69:29)
from ultra sun ultra moon the gameplay (69:27 - 69:31)
that i had watched (69:29 - 69:34)
interested me more the thing that needs (69:31 - 69:35)
to interest greg (69:34 - 69:38)
are the disco outfits that you craft (69:35 - 69:39)
when you craft (69:38 - 69:40)
your outfits from the apps oh you're (69:39 - 69:42)
really stylish in that ball (69:40 - 69:45)
disco man bottoms you have to show me (69:42 - 69:47)
the disco outfits to convince me that (69:45 - 69:48)
this is something that i want to do (69:47 - 69:50)
there's some good outfits (69:48 - 69:52)
i was looking like ingo and emmet the (69:50 - 69:55)
other day there you go (69:52 - 69:58)
uh will pokemon of the week uh so (69:55 - 70:00)
unfortunately i deleted the text for (69:58 - 70:03)
last week's pokemon because i had to (70:00 - 70:05)
reboot my computer and i didn't save it (70:03 - 70:06)
but i just remember (70:05 - 70:10)
i was kind of salty because (70:06 - 70:13)
in celebration of uh pokemon go's fifth (70:10 - 70:14)
anniversary (70:13 - 70:18)
they acknowledged the 555 pokemon (70:14 - 70:22)
by making the 554 pokemon (70:18 - 70:24)
appear more frequently in the wild which (70:22 - 70:26)
of course the 555 pokemon (70:24 - 70:28)
has does not appear in the wild not that (70:26 - 70:30)
they couldn't have made it up here (70:28 - 70:34)
either way i said for the pokemon of the (70:30 - 70:35)
week (70:34 - 70:37)
next year if they followed the same (70:35 - 70:38)
trend (70:37 - 70:40)
there you go natural consequences might (70:38 - 70:42)
make you sick to your stomach (70:40 - 70:44)
i remember what it is i know what it is (70:42 - 70:46)
greg all right i will say the bad thing (70:44 - 70:47)
then (70:46 - 70:51)
okay it's (70:47 - 70:54)
spoopa (70:51 - 70:54)
spupa yeah see before i could say the (70:54 - 70:58)
bad thing oh (70:56 - 71:00)
i just say it's avalog and you jumped in (70:58 - 71:01)
without (71:00 - 71:04)
no you mean you wanted to say the wrong (71:01 - 71:05)
answer yeah i want to say the wrong (71:04 - 71:07)
answer (71:05 - 71:10)
avalog i got so excited what are you (71:07 - 71:11)
french (71:10 - 71:13)
with (71:11 - 71:13)
uh there's no trivia here right oh there (71:15 - 71:18)
is (71:18 - 71:22)
there is and its evolutionary relatives (71:18 - 71:23)
are the only (71:22 - 71:27)
bug type introduced in gen 6. (71:23 - 71:28)
spoopa is the only pokemon with the base (71:27 - 71:32)
stat total of 213. (71:28 - 71:34)
uh spoopa and its evolutionaries are the (71:32 - 71:35)
only gen (71:34 - 71:42)
6 pokemon in the bug egg group (71:35 - 71:42)
spoopa is like fine (71:43 - 71:50)
it's a turtleneck wearing bug you (71:47 - 71:52)
love it yeah you love your turtlenecks (71:50 - 71:55)
did you guys know that it had its (71:52 - 71:58)
own trophy in smash bros ultimate (71:55 - 72:02)
what why not out of all pokemon (71:58 - 72:05)
what trophy for what though (72:02 - 72:05)
returns as a pokemon summon from a (72:06 - 72:10)
pokeball retaining the same behavior as (72:08 - 72:12)
the previous game (72:10 - 72:14)
spoopa appears at a pokeball summon it (72:12 - 72:16)
uses stun spore to temporarily stun a (72:14 - 72:18)
pokemon in his attack but doesn't move (72:16 - 72:19)
otherwise (72:18 - 72:21)
spoopa also appears as a trophy see the (72:19 - 72:24)
real trick is no smash brother player (72:21 - 72:26)
knows what the pokemon do because they (72:24 - 72:28)
turn off all right they turn up items (72:26 - 72:30)
yes get wrecked items uh as a (72:28 - 72:32)
professional mario kart player that (72:30 - 72:32)
turns off (72:32 - 72:34)
all items in mario kart i want the (72:32 - 72:36)
purest racing experience (72:34 - 72:39)
only racing and we always race downtown (72:36 - 72:40)
baby park (72:39 - 72:42)
because it is the closest to a real life (72:40 - 72:43)
race track (72:42 - 72:47)
it's all valid reasons all right (72:43 - 72:51)
this week's pokemon at first i started (72:47 - 72:52)
out and i made it easy (72:51 - 72:55)
and then since i'm so incredibly hungry (72:52 - 72:56)
right now because we've gone on (72:55 - 72:58)
much longer than we said we were going (72:56 - 73:00)
to hey our timing's been okay (72:58 - 73:03)
the hard version unless your (73:00 - 73:05)
teenage will anderson who would just (73:03 - 73:06)
like get this (73:05 - 73:11)
in a heartbeat think of recent events (73:06 - 73:13)
this week's pokemon has less to do with (73:11 - 73:15)
dragons than it has to do with the woman (73:13 - 73:17)
who lent her family name to the sonic (73:15 - 73:19)
youth side project that produced the (73:17 - 73:20)
whitey album on april 5th (73:19 - 73:24)

take off the hoodie (73:53 - 73:56)
when i have the stream backpack i never (73:56 - 73:59)
