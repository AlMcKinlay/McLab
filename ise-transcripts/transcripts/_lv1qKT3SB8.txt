and we are back from our break I have a special guest with with us today actually you guys probably already know cuz I probably would have said it in the intro here but the magic of recording I am inserting this into our episode but I have Dan Reichert here from Giant Bomb more importantly Pokemon expert Pokemon expert 101 Dan record my business card says yeah the number one Pokemon fan at Giant Bomb right I mean maybe I don't know how many Pokemon fans there are there I don't talk about it a lot I don't know well you guys have been talking about it a little bit more because of Pokemon go yeah of course I mean we can't be video game podcast and they ignore that phenomenon so obviously it's been coming up recently but as far as the the classic games I don't know if we have like a major Pokemon editor Austin Walker I believe played some of the old games but I may be the most experienced Pokemon editor now I'm not sure that's awesome I have a ton of questions for you but before we go into this do you want to just give a little summary of who you are besides the fact that you work at Giant Bomb who is Dan record boy to serve that kind of a all-purpose Internet idiot lots of I mean if you I'm sure just a Google search my name would come up with dozens and dozens of just dumb things I've done whether on my own or when I worked a Game Informer now I work a Giant Bomb written a few books a couple of them were super silly books one of them was more of a serious one and now I'm kind of working on a more autobiographical one of kind of funny stories I'm a pro wrestling manager here in Northern California I'm a bad guy tag team manager that's kind of the broad strokes that say okay alright uh I I prepped you earlier but we were gonna start off with some Pokemon questions and then we'll probably go way off topic from that but that's totally cool that's er anytime we interview somebody like when we interviewed Austin creator only we interviewed J wits it was rarely about Pokemon but if we're talking about Austin Creed if I can direct some of your listeners if you just say YouTube it was on his show up up down down I played against him in Soul Calibur with some stakes for the losers so if you want to look up Dan record versus Austin Creed's Soul Calibur I'm pretty happy with how that turned out okay all right did you guys ever do your Mario Kart Double Dash thing no he backed out okay he a year prior to PAX East told me that he had requested off and everything he was set for Boston he was ready to go but then he had to go become one of the biggest acts in the company and instead it's a little harder to get off work when we were the tag team champions and incredibly popular so we had to go over to Europe and he missed facts East I when I spent the day with him I forgot to bring that up because I feel like I'm also pretty good at double dash and I feel like I could even take him I don't know what his his double dash skills are though well he's good yeah here's the thing he man he has made this whole campaign about how I'm lying about what happened WrestleMania weekend San Francisco last year but the honest-to-god truth story this is not an act is that we set up a Mario Kart Double Dash tournament at a video game bar here near where Wrestlemania was last year in the Bay Area and we set up 16 players me Austin Creed we're in there one of the WWE referees Jason hires and then a bunch of random people that we found at the bar I asked Roddy Piper I asked a hacksaw jim duggan that they benefit but but yeah in the finals it was there were four of us and me and Austin were in the finals and I won at the double - yes I beat Xavier / Austin that is the true story there and I don't claim to be necessarily great at that game I played a ton of it in college I played all the mario cards to death but the fact of the matter is I did beat him but we didn't have it on tape or anything we weren't streaming it so he was it was very easy for him to go on Twitter and twitch in a show and everything and say never happened okay right now honestly got a true story I beat him all right all right we'll keep record here let's dive into things yeah since you are since you are the Pokemon expert let's I want to test your knowledge real quick with one question how many Pokemon do you think there are currently eight hundred Wow actually you're pretty close right yeah there are 720 one officially and so far the Pokemon company has shown up 25 new ones so probably when the new games come out we'll have 800 at that point okay so I was kind of ballpark I know about that you know the 150 slice 151 early on and I know they've added on with all the the different ones so I actually had to research a bunch of Pokemon stuff recently because my girlfriend told me a story about when she was in like fifth or sixth grade or something she had a bunch of holographic Pokemon cards and like two sleeves folding so there's 18 of them and some kid in her class stole them she took them from class to to show em off cuz she was so proud of all of her holographic cards and they got stolen and I was so like devastated hearing that us I mean who could do that to you when your instance and isn't a little kid like I was so mad about that story so I like kinda stealthily was asking her about the different cards she had because I didn't know enough about Pokemon and so I was writing while down secretly without telling her and I went to all these different eBay sellers and everything and I bought them one by one and about a couple sleeves and I and I returned her stolen Pokemon card Stuart such an amazing story she was very happy how many you do you have all the Pokemon amiibos oh man they're right in the other room I've got actually you know what yeah I think I do I might not have a loose sorry oh I have Jigglypuff I have a Pikachu Charizard greninja I'm it greninja faced the corner because I think he looks stupid what else are there I think loose REO might be knowing when I don't have it I might even have that I've kind of think I think you named him aww yeah Mewtwo Charizard Jigglypuff lucario lucario no that's alright I the the the joke on the show is I butcher a lot of pokémon names so my listeners use that against me well I've heard from drying bomb fans that I mispronounced even the word Pokemon I think I say pokemons and it says it technically Pokemon how do I say it Pokemon poster okay and I say pokey yeah yeah so I'll probably mess that up throughout that's all right you can't can't win them all what what's your what's your favorite Pokemon do you have one oh man like the longest time the only ones I knew at all who were from Smash Brothers I favor one it would have to be something from smash four because I'm in charge are it's pretty cool I like him yeah yeah you can't go wrong with a dragon yeah yeah my sister is a big Pokemon fan and she told me that there's one that's just a literal pile of trash now is it gruba sh4 trubbish trubbish yeah and it evolves into garbo odor okay maybe that one that's kind of funny to me no that's really cool pile of trash I don't know I would say probably Charizard I mean I like Pikachu as well he's a you know if you play games at all you got to be somewhat familiar with Pikachu even if you don't play pokemon games i like Snorlax he seems like a cool guy yeah do you know there's a there before Snorlax there's a pokémon called munchlax and all he does is eat and then eventually evolves into Snorlax is he like a skinny version or is he fat from the beginning uh he's a little chubbier but he's he's really tiny compared to snow relax okay so it's like once he gets it's like that's the Pokemon version of catching diabetes do you eat too much and you get too big and then you become a Snorlax right yeah and then all you do is sleep and eat and sleep just being instead of just eating that sounds alright thumbs up America pretty well yeah move on to some more serious questions the first one starting so you're at Giant Bomb now you mentioned before you were at Game Informer yeah you moved across the country for that so how different is life it's a tremendously different uh you know we talked a little bit before we started recording here you're from the Midwest as well you know I grew up in Kansas I moved to Minnesota for for Game Informer and so I was very much used to that kind of like semis suburban but still kind of close to a big enough city you know area and so moving out here to San Francisco where everything is different I mean it's I'm looking at the ocean right now on my window which is crazy because I didn't see the ocean ever till I was like 26 years old or something now I see it every morning when I wake up you know I just I sold my car within like two months and moving out here because I've never lived in an area with public transportation and now it's like I lived here for a couple months since I'm not driving anywhere I might as well just sell it and take the bus everywhere so that's a totally new thing but it's it's a lot of changes some good some bad but overall I mean I wouldn't take back the decision in a million years I love working a Giant Bomb I've come to love San Francisco well maybe love is a strong word I love my life in San Francisco I've got a really good job I've got a good friend Circle got this and this girlfriend that I'm in love with here it's just it's a good life right now so I'm very happy here that's awesome can you talk about the first time you met Jeff and the rest of the giant bomb crew I don't know if that story was ever told but obviously you moved across the country so you must have had some good relationship with Jeff before that happened yeah I did the technical first time I met him was III I want to say Oh 8:00 and there's actually a picture of me meeting him because at this time you know I was not in the industry I was a college student I was writing for my towns like kind of college paper reviewing videogames and paying my way out to e3 every year just trying to get connections and see all the new games and report on him and so I was just a fan you know I knew Jeff from the GameSpot days and everything and this was right after the whole I came in Lynch controversy and everything the whole firing from GameSpot and he was just starting up Giant Bomb at this time when I first met him and there's a picture of me and my dorky Lawrence calm shirt and I got a fan picture with him and I went up to him and I said oh you're a great girl he was like actually Jeff Carson I screwed up mixed up Greg Kesava and in him so screwed up right away but yeah just a quick picture with him and that was that until later on once I started working a GameInformer and I got on Twitter so this would have been like late oh nine and I was tweeting about how much I loved Waluigi back then and he he saw that him and Ryan Davis saw me talking about Waluigi and they followed me like basically like to grief me to make fun of me for liking this terrible character and so that's how this all started I came to know Jeff and Ryan and John bond crew thanks to tweeting about Waluigi and then going forward as I went to all these industry events and III s and all this stuff I I would always run into Jeff and you know since we talked all the time on Twitter we would hang out at these shows and Jeff and Ryan started in inviting me on to the bomb cast during e3 so got a little bit of experience actually working with the guys on podcasts and and when the time came when I was ready to get out of Minnesota and move on career-wise that had all worked out cool yeah that's a great story actually I didn't know the whole beginning part of you know just being a fan oh yeah yeah mm eh it was such a long time ago now yeah yeah I've been doing III since oh six so I guess this year was my tenth one actually well no I guess it'll be my ninth one cuz I missed the one in between Game Informer and guy bomb I was getting ready for the move oh right right yep yeah you have a ton of fans and you're also a huge fan of uh well I think it's okay for me to say this you're a huge fan of wrestling and wrestlers oh yes and in if you look at the other side of the coin you have a lot of fans because of Giant Bomb how do you handle both situations of your fans and then also being a fan I mean I've never stopped considering myself a fan in general even if just like the gaming industry like I I kind of just feel lucky to be here every morning so yeah I don't know I it is weird to stop and think that like yes I have fans and you know much followers on Twitter and all that stuff because I still just feel like a lucky kid who gets to play video games at work you know I don't 33 years old now but I mean I honestly feel like like a kid that won some toys-r-us contests and now I'm getting paid to play video games or something so yeah it's it's I consider myself a fan first and foremost a fan of video games a fan of wrestling I mean those are the two things that I've been absolutely in love with since the first time I encountered both of them so I'm a fan first I'd say okay I want to move into the book you wrote which I've read I loved I actually when we when we started talking on Twitter I told you that you know I don't experience anxiety but my girlfriend really does and you wrote a book called anxiety as an ally and about two or three years ago and so being a big fan of you and Giant Bomb I would I would be in situations where I would come home and my girlfriend would be nowhere to be found her car would be in the garage her phone would be on the table and she just I couldn't find her and I would end up fine walking into like our walk-in closet and her just on the floor crying and not being able to explain what went wrong and to me I always felt like what did I do I like I just got home I don't why are you upset and so it was very hard for me you know and I've been with her for over five years now and I didn't know how to deal with that and I actually read your book I got it because of your stories on giantbomb and it everything almost made sense to me so I kind of wanted to talk about the book and why you wrote it well it's interesting that what you described is it's kind of exactly why I wrote it is I wanted people kind of two reasons I wanted people with anxiety to kind of see the ways that I've kind of helped make it a lot easier for myself and I don't have nearly as much anxiety as I used to but also what you described is is for people that have loved ones you know people in their family or significant others or friends that have anxiety disorders and I'm not talking about like standard you know stressors and things like that like everyone gets stressed everyone feels anxiety you know like overwork or tests or school or whatever it is I'm talking about like you know disorders like what you're describing with your girlfriend and what I have because it's a it's an impossible thing to describe because a lot of times people will just be like Oh what do you have to worry about what's going on why don't we why would you be nervous right now what's making you anxious and that's the frustrating thing is like there's never or a lot of times there is no actual thing that's causing it it's just it just happens because you have a disorder it's an illness and it was extremely frustrating for me growing up trying to explain this to certain people in my family namely my father my father back then you know I talked about this in the book but he would just be like chill out just chill out what he have to worry about come on way to quit being weird just you know chill out and I would try to explain like no dad you don't understand like I am feel like man you know my heart rate is going crazy my breathing is nuts I feel like something terrible's about to happen and logically you know I knew that that there was nothing there's no danger there's no imminent danger it's just this fight-or-flight reflex that was kicking in at inappropriate times so I wanted to write a book for for people like you that have significant other so you can read it and have kind of a better idea of what they're going through in fact my dad read the book after came out and he called me to apologize he's like wow okay now that I've read this book I I see where you're going through and I and I I see that it was a very real thing so so it's that I wanted people like you to be able to read it and understand people in your life that have anxiety disorders yeah I think I started listening to Giant Bomb two to three weeks before you actually came on I remember the whole Vinny moving to New York and them setting up Giant Bomb East and then when you came on Giant Bomb I was just like who is this guy because I remember like your hot dog story in college and all the crazy food you eat and I was like this get Ike is are you a real person yeah yeah I'm pretty sure you know that's that's a thing I get a lot just because you know I do tell a lot of crazy stories and I yes ah I maybe I play things up at times you know I play I play dumb a decent amount for I guess entertainment purposes but the important thing to me is that I never lie you know I all the stories I tell you know the hot dog stories are the egg-white stories whatever those are all I do percent truth but yeah it's kind of hard to describe it's not something I consciously do it's not like when I see the red light on a camera or when the podcast starts and I'm like okay time to turn into dumb Dan it's it's not like that it's just I don't know it's just kind of you play things up you go back to wrestling like an analogy is you always hear about the the best pro wrestling characters are just real-life like who the wrestler is as a real person turned up to 11 like to a cartoonish degree like Stone Cold Steve Austin it really is a beer-swilling redneck you know the rock really is this kind of you know cocky charismatic dude so it yeah it is just my real personality in real stories but yeah things are played up to a certain extent I would say but but yes I think I'm a real person well after you know the your your egg whites or your hot dog story I don't know when when you I can't remember the exact time when you started talking about your book or your anxiety on giantbomb but it really to me it was like a right time right time and place situation and when I talked earlier about like always asking my girlfriend like what do you have to worry about we have two good jobs you know we have we have a savings we have three cats like life is good nothing's going we don't have medical bills like I don't get why you're worrying or why you're so anxious and for me it was like you have this cartoonish character on giantbomb which is a compliment like I think the whole I think you're amazing I think John Baum is amazing but then for you to go like almost a hundred and eighty degrees of having these egg-white stories to now having a book on anxiety I was so compelled to buy it and read it and my girlfriend read it and she loved it and that opened up a window I think in my life to go like now I understand things better but that leads me to my second question is you spent a bit of time just a couple weeks ago on giantbomb talking about a book called 10% happier yeah and you were just recently on the 10% happier podcast which was fantastic thank you I think that's like you've now opened up a second window in my life to meditation and I kind of wanted to talk about that so 10% happier isn't a book that like teaches you about meditation it's just a book that informs you is that would you agree like just lets you know that it exists I think it just serves as kind of a gateway for people that you don't know anything about meditation like I considered myself kind of one I mean you know I've been doing it for a long time but I started out very skeptical about it because it just seemed to me like back when I didn't know anything about it that it was just this new agey thing with a bunch of people sitting around chanting or whatever like I didn't know if it was a religious thing or was but once I started doing it I realized that it's just it's exercise for your mind the same way that that physical exercise works for your body it doesn't have to come with any of the spiritual things if you don't want it to and that's what the book is targeting as Dan Harris is a guy he's a anchor for Good Morning America and for Nightline and he had a panic attack on the air while he was hosting Good Morning America and so that led him and he's very naturally skeptical about you know those new agey type things it led him into looking about meditation and learning about it and so basically it's just taking the skeptics perspective the meditation and just okay okay I'm just a regular guy I'm not like somebody who's you know chanting you're collecting healing crystals or you know talking about chakras or you know all these things that make meditation seem impenetrable if that's all you hear about it his book was just a way of kind of boiling it down to like hey here's what it is when it comes down to it it's following your breath it just it helps anxiety there's just been a million scientific studies on this stuff that you know this is a real thing you can take it to the super religious degree if you want to or you can just you know meditate every day the way you would get on the elliptical every day so that's what really led me to that book and then got me way more in a meditation than I already was is it's a great resource it's a great entry way for people that that kind of don't know what meditation is so yeah after I read anxiety as an ally I don't think a lot of listeners know this about me but I think everyone has struggles in their life especially you know as you grow older and things change but at one point that that book kind of opened a window and I my girlfriend suggested that I should go to therapy and I don't know if you've ever been to therapy or or what not but I remember when you told the meditation story and you were you were like I originally thought it was like for hippies or like this new age kind of thing and I I thought the same thing of therapy I was like I'm not and I told my girlfriend I'm like I'm not crazy I don't need help I'm perfectly sound like I wake up every day I go to work I work I come home I do this I do that like why would I need therapy and I ended up going going for about six weeks six or eight weeks a couple sessions once a week and kind of just walk through things and things were things just got so much better instantly and it was funny because I told my mom that and she's the same thing I originally thought she's like what are you crazy do you need help it's like do we need to check you into a mental institute and I was like no mom like yeah it was like if you're sick you go to the doctor if you need and I and I save like if you need advice like you can go to a therapist like it's kind of the same thing but it did help a lot and then on the bomb cast you started talking about 10% happier I ended up going through that whole book and and I recently started meditating I do 10 minutes a day and I've done that for the about the past two weeks and it's it's like day and night different my days yeah and that's I that's mostly to you and how you've kind of broken things down and I don't know if if other listeners have told you that but you know you go from like anxiety to an ally to you promoting 10 percent happier to you saying that meditation is great and that's you were right in every one of those aspects I appreciate that and that's part of what I want to do is you know you talk about you know the way some people react when you say you're going to therapy is you know you're crazier like I did it's just silly to me that there's still a stigma among some people about like you know people that meditate oh you're a hippie or Oh people that go to therapy oh you must be crazy like no there shouldn't be a stigma attached to that whether you know the most serious mental illness or just everyday stress and in normal anxiety you know it's there's no problem with that like there should be no shame and admitting that you know you could you could talk so you could use someone to talk to or you could use you know looking into something like meditation to kind of improve things you know it's I think it's just absolutely silly to be to be ashamed of something like that it's like being ashamed of getting a cold I just don't understand why people would think that way and so I I want to open up the conversation as much as possible you know I've got a lot of followers and I have these platforms where a lot of people can hear me and I kind of want to do what I can to help bring that stigma down and and show that it's not just for crazy people and hippies or whatever you said after your dad read your book he kind of apologized when it came to the anxiety thing what was his reaction to you telling him like you you meditate was it still the like oh oh you're doing this hippy thing or was he more understanding of that I mean by the time I was talking a lot about meditation that was kind of round the time like it was just a couple years ago that I really started talking about meditation a lot and by that time my dad had already kind of understood that he was wrong to kind of blow it off earlier in my life so it's not like we talked about meditation or anything like that or it's it's certainly not something that that he would ever try himself but he's never given me any grief for it you know if if I talked about it 10 years ago I bet he would have but by the time I was like really talking about it a lot he he was a used kind of grown out of that I think for for people listening to this and curious because on the show we don't really get to you know specific and topic besides Pokemon but like as serious as a topic as this isn't something I wanted to talk to you about because it's was such an influence on my life how did you start meditating because I think that it's something that anyone or everyone could do even if they don't have anxiety or that they're not going to therapy I still think it's a valuable tool that somebody could do every day how did you start I started in 2002 it was right before I went to college and I had a psychology class I did this thing where the summer before you start your freshman year you take a couple classes on campus to kind of get used to how college works blah blah blah but one of them was a psychology class and I had this teacher named buddy and he had us meditate in class and prior to that I had never ever thought about meditation whatsoever I mean I would have just blown it off it's like the hippie thing or whatever and this is also prior to me you know really developing my anxiety disorders and in full force so he told us as a class he's like all right I'm gonna show you guys something and if you do this for an hour day I promise you it will change your life and he got like way more like serious and like adamant about this and I had ever seen him in class he was like I'm telling you right now I'm not gonna I can't force you to do this but if you do this for now or your life will change for the better I never go okay when this is gonna get weird what is this about and he had us do 10 minutes of meditation he had us all close our eyes and just do the most basic meditation 101 you can imagine you know focus on the breath you know when thoughts come in you know acknowledge that you had a thought and then just kind of let it go and don't beat yourself up for for getting off track of the breath you know it was just the most starter meditation thing ever but yeah and after 10 minutes just the the feeling that I had was and you have to remember that at this point in my life I had not had anxiety disorders before but even then I just noticed that just from my baseline normal how I went about my day to 10 minutes later the difference was so so noticeable that I kind of realized that okay wow this is not just some weird hippy thing this is this is a real thing like I feel noticeably different right now and I even went into that thing really skeptical and just went along with it because I was is what my teacher is telling me I need to do right now I guess I'll do it and it totally worked I felt completely different after that ten minutes and that's what got me interested in continuing that going forward I remember my first time attempting to meditate it wasn't with an app it wasn't with you know any help it was just assuming what I knew about meditation and after listening to ten percent happier and I tried it for 10 or 15 minutes and it didn't I was frustrated that like I didn't feel any better our I didn't think it worked and I was again slightly dismissive of it so I guess my question is eventually I found a groove I did use an app I use an app called a headspace I don't know I use that yeah yeah I scoured the Internet of what people suggested and the only complaint I found about headspace was it was expensive but that app helped me a lot some sessions feel really good and some don't and the app does tell you like hey sometimes it's harder on certain days and that's okay what would you say to somebody who you know gave it a try once or twice but didn't feel anything I remember you talking to Dan Harris and he said like the first time you pick up an instrument you're just not automatically good at it and you shouldn't let that discourage you yeah and just like physical exercise you know if you walk into a gym for the first time you're not gonna add benchpress 500 pounds you know that's not how it works like you know maybe I was lucky that that it works so well for the first time and I don't want to oversell my first time like I felt noticeably different enough to realize that it was a real thing and that really put me down the path of really wanted to dig deep on this stuff but yeah it is definitely improved over time like I'm doing an hour two hours not two hours at a time but two hours broken up throughout the day now and it's significantly better than that first ten minutes but yeah you know it's like you said it's not gonna work the first time like to this full extent it's not going to be the same as if you've been for ten years and you're doing it for an hour at a time hopefully if you really go for it you will at least feel something just enough to kind of show you that like hey this is a real thing but yeah don't don't expect your life to change you're not gonna get superpowers or anything you know that's I think that's the mistake a lot of people make is like oh I'm gonna start doing this all the time and it's gonna be like those superpower like you know that it's this whole different mental state and sick no it's not it just it gives you better perspective on things and it kind of puts a break in between like stimuli and reaction it gives you a second to kind of step back and be like okay wait how do I want to react this is this really worth getting mad about but don't expect all that stuff to come after ten minutes and most importantly don't get discouraged if you think you're bad at it because everyone is bad at it at first you know if you close your eyes and just try to follow the breath you're not gonna be able to do that for 10 minutes your first time you know there are plenty of times I can't do that when I'm sitting down for an hour so the whole practice of meditation is recognizing when your brain is going astray like you know if you're trying to focus on your your breath and then you notice other thoughts coming in meditation is all about noticing that those thoughts came in acknowledging that and not beating yourself up you just let it kind of float on by like I think one of those headspace animations said like you know picture your brain and it's like this the sky and every once in a while a clouds gonna come by and you don't get mad at the cloud you just kind of let it float by and some days are gonna be clearer than others so if you if you sit there the whole time and beat yourself up every time another thought comes into your head you're not gonna get anywhere with it so it's just a matter of kind of realizing that and a lot of that comes through practice how do you fit I know a lot of people are think they're their day is already too busy and when I first started meditating I was like I don't know how I would even fit this into my day and now I find it extremely easy to just take 10 minutes after lunch or that's what I've been doing it is after lunch to meditate and that helps me with the rest of my afternoon at work but you've been you meditate 1 to 2 hours a day so I'm sure people are dumbfounded of like how does he have that much time in the day I mean you you make time for the things that are important to you you know before I was doing an hour day of meditation you know back when I was doing you know ten minutes a day or just kind of slacking off and not doing a lot I mean I was easily spending more than an hour just messing around on Twitter or just you know clicking through the same you know links on my computer that I check every single day just going through those same cycles like then I found out that oh you know meditations make me feel way better than just kind of mindlessly browsing the Internet so I found time for it you know I wake up an hour earlier I go to work early I you know we're basically supposed to be on the clock at 10 o'clock so I get there by 9 o'clock every day and I said now and I do it at work for an hour so you just make time for it and I know it's easy for me to say has you know a guy with no kids and you know my only real responsibility is getting to work and doing my thing there but you know even if you have kids even if you have a lot of busy stuff going on in your life you can believe 10 minutes early can leave 15 minutes early try to find time for it it doesn't look I know I'm doing an hour to a day that's really kind of intensive meditation practice 10 minutes a day will help you tremendously just shave off 10 minutes of something else you're doing that maybe isn't making it feel great and put it towards this and before we wrap up the meditation part is there is there like an app or some or a book or something you would recommend to somebody you haven't wrote you haven't written a meditation book yet well I mean anxieties and a lie is is pretty heavily especially near the end about meditation it kind of talks about it covers several different things that are kind of helped me with my anxiety but I think the big takeaway of my book is is kind of how much meditation changed things for me so but yeah it's certainly not a how-to on meditation I'd say if you want to learn what kind of more of a how to check out wherever you go there you are by Jon kabat-zinn he is a he's a guy that kind of brought mindfulness meditation to the West back in I believe the 70s you know it's it's a little more kind of Flowery a little more hippyish way of speaking than like me or dan harris but all the advice is really good and it really does a good job of explaining the benefits of meditation as well as how how to do it awesome well let's let's move away from that heavy topic I I appreciate you taking the time and talking about that because that's something that's been you know a little bit newer to me and it was really because of your conversation that you guys had a giant bond that really sprung that forward well I'm glad to open up that conversation whenever I get a chance so it's cool to see people taking something out of it yeah and hopefully hopefully my listeners can get and get a takeaway from that I run a we have a patreon for the show and we have a slack community or some people use discord but it's pretty much the same thing but we have a slack community for people who who donate like a dollar a month and we have a we have a mindfulness channel in there and it's cool it's a it's a lot of people that oh you you you started meditating and I'm like yeah and this is the app I use and so far so good and so it's kind of been filling up with more people and like that's really cool for me to see because I was a little not embarrassed but I didn't know how to like pitch that to people like hey instead of going to like I'm going to a gym but not for my body for my mind right and a lot of people are gonna be skeptical going in obviously so it's cool that some people have joined up in your discord in your slack there I'd say if people have specific questions that to me about that stuff like I try my best to interact on Twitter you know as much as I can with people so yeah if you have any questions about meditation or book recommendations or anything like that you or any of your listeners can get ahold of me at Dan Reicher awesome I just have a couple more questions before we wrap up here you are a big gamer obviously working for Giant Bomb Austin when we asked him he said his his favorite game was Sonic 2 but what about you link to the past that's the all-time favorite a hundred percent always has been you know I played games before that you know I got my first NES and I was four years old this would've been about like 88 and you know my first memories are playing in a Mario and Megaman punch-out but it was linked to the past that I played that I knew like as soon as I played that game okay this is I need to focus my entire life on video games like this is everything to me I mean it already kind of was with the NES but I think Link to the Past is the thing that made me like decide that I had to do this for the rest of my life like as a career I saw you recently delete clash royale from your phone yes and I think I had the same journey of you of of loving that game but also being extremely frustrated with it well it as you see more and more what that game is you realize all the little tricks and dumb things it does to try to pull you in and get money from you and everything and I understand why they do it I mean video games are a business and companies need to make business you need to make money and obviously clash Royale is doing a very good job of that but we started noticing the little gameplay ways that they they always dangle that Kara but never quite give it to you hoping that you're gonna give money it does feel a little insidious and I just wanted to get out of that daily grind of I always have to have a chest unlocking I always have to have this going on oh I'm kind of tempted to buy some gems like I just I saw that there was no end in sight for that game you know there's no you don't beat that game it's it just keeps going like that and it never really feels good so yeah I've been feeling much better ever since I did get rid of that game I I felt a sigh a sigh of relief I as a freedom actually I say I'm afraid to play player but I accidentally press the $100 button at one point okay because I meant to do $5.00 I was getting ready to go out for the night you know how like at a certain time you get new cards that rotate in yeah and there's there was one card I wanted to buy I was like okay I can give if I want this card I'll give it $5.00 and I was getting ready to go out to an anniversary dinner and I I hit the button and it asked for my touch ID and I gave it to it and then it asked for my touch ID again and I was like that's that's weird look why is it asking twice so I I hit it again but my other my hand was hovering over the hundred so it charged me and and right away I asked for my money back right yeah so I'm in the car I asked for my money back and they they gave me my money back action so they gave me my money back really quick I cuz iTunes does that right iTunes like every what once a year it's like okay you made a mistake here's your money right and they didn't take the gems away from me Oh which I thought they were going to do and I assumed they were going to do so I had all these gems for almost two months I didn't want to spend them because I figured they were gonna eventually take them away and they and they didn't and so I had the like the luck or the niceness of like slowly spending gems and even then they still dangled that carrot in front of you and even by buying like the biggest chests and stuff I still didn't get a legendary I still didn't get the only thing I was able to do was like I can upgrade every one of my cards because I have enough gold to do this yeah and you always think that that next thing that next upgrade that next level for your towers that's gonna be the moment that like Oh finally I'm gonna like I'm gonna win so much more and it's gonna be so much fun it's gonna be great and then you get there and then you realize you're getting matched with people that are also there and it's just the same back and forth 50% infuriating stuff and people laughing at you with the emotes and stuff and the moats are terrible oh I never get mad about video games like any time I'm playing like a multiplayer shooter or anything whenever I die you know people always get mad and you know these videos on YouTube people cursing and screaming when they die I never get mad I'm just like oh yeah if you shot me I lost I did worse than that guy whatever clash Royale is like the only game that I get serious had or if I lose in some like total BS fashion I just need to put my phone facing down just because I know that they're gonna just spam that the Laughing King or the crying King or something and it's oh there's something about it that's so infuriating so another reason I'm glad to be done with that game yeah it's it's it's crazy because at it's a great game and even if like there was if I could just pay you know $60 for that game and just have everything and be done with it I think it would be great and I understood I understand their business model I understand they were you know they were the number one top grossing app in the App Store but Pokemon go kind of took that away from them yeah they did it in a totally like candy crush clash Royale clash of clans they all kind of follow this carrot on the stick and I don't feel like Pokemon go does that which is surprising because it's making more money than all of them it's I think Apple reported it was the most downloaded app of all time recently what were your as a you know you're not a big Pokemon guy but what were your thoughts on that especially in the aspect of it does it does mobile gaming totally different than everything up to this point yeah I mean I it I played it for a while you know I put a few hours into it before I deleted it I think it's genius I think it's such a smart thing you're taking this this property a Pokemon that you know there's a lot of people that are a lot of adults now they grew up with that and having much nostalgia towards it so the property spans several different generations of gamers at this point and then you make it free to download and it's on devices that everyone already has in their pockets like it's reaching audiences that you know maybe don't play games that often that they they're out and buying 3ds they're not buying Vitas and things like that but they used to play pokemon back in like elementary school and then when they see it's on the phone that they already have and they already carry everywhere and it's free that's a no-brainer so you're tapping into like the nostalgic people that have been out of games for a long time you're tapping into people that are hardcore gamers and keep up with everything I mean they've managed to reach every every type of person you can imagine I mean I live in a big city I take public transportation and I always see people playing it just constantly so I think it's genius I think they did a really really good job with it you know it's not for me I'm done with my time with it but kudos to them they did something really unique and they're they're reaping the rewards of it right now so and I think we'll be around for a while that kind of leads into just you know a couple other questions about Pokemon do you see how I started with Pokemon um and do you folks that's good you said prior to us recording you you were a little bit familiar with the more familiar with the spin-off titles was there anything that kind of stood out in your mind I feel like the go-to for everyone is pokemons net snap but I I believe you did a quick look with Jeff of poke and tournaments so their Pokemon has gone like every which direction with their spin-off titles yeah and I've I've dabbled with a lot of it yeah I loved you know Pokemon I have times people play pokemon snap but when red and blue and yellow came around I was in like eighth or ninth grade so I was in that like you know I'm 13 14 15 whatever years old however old you are there and it's at that age a lot of people that I went school with kind of viewed of those like oh that's that kiddie game that's a game for kids and and I probably kind of subscribed that mindset to like yeah this looks like some cartoon thing or whatever I'm 15 I'm gonna deal if I'm cool I'm gonna play metal gear you know which mode of your school is hell but so yeah I had a dumb attitude back then about Pokemon and that I just I wouldn't play it at all but I did play snap I enjoyed that like I had the younger sisters that were they were born in 93 so they were very much the right age for Pokemon so they would have it and I would see them playing snap or the minigames on Pokemon Stadium things like that so I played a lot of that stuff it wasn't until Pokemon X actually that I played one of the core games it was that Game Informer at the time and I got out of that you know phase of my life where's his desk kitty crab so I actually was open-minded about it and you know I worked at a game outlet so I had a free copy so it was like wait actually no no we only got a couple codes for that in the office and I didn't get one and I remember actually yeah so I bought that game I was curious enough about it and uh people were talking about it yeah you know what I'll buy this and I put probably ten or twelve hours under Pokemon X and you know what I had a good time I enjoyed it I think I actually wrote an article on Game Informer about it I'm not entirely sure yeah I forget at this point you know it's been thousands of things but I'm pretty sure it's like oh hey here's impressions of Pokemon X from a from a franchise new cover or something I think it was called and it was it was very positive I didn't wind up beating the game but but I'm never liking what I played and I see the appeal of it definitely I saw the excitement of every time some new Pokemon showed up its economic God I have to get this and you know waiting for the ball the clink shut and everything it's I totally see the appeal now I wish I wouldn't have been a dumb junior I close minded kid but yeah that's how it was back then but no I I totally appreciate Pokemon but I can't paint myself as some expert er or do you see yourself looking forward to Sun and Moon is that's something that my mom doesn't report on a lot of Pokemon stuff I think you guys have even said that on the last bomb cast but you guys looked at pokken tournament yeah Pokemon Sun and Moon probably really big cuz those games are always you know top three sellers of the year for you know systems but is that something you guys are gonna look at or probably not yeah I you know just personally look you know I can't say what our coverage plans are because we haven't talked about it yet but personally I think I would get that and play it I think the big thing for me is my girlfriend's a bit younger than me and so she was more of the right age for Pokemon when I first came out so she she's played Maul she loves Pokemon look as I said earlier with the cards and everything so yeah we went through a while recently where she was playing pokemon red every night in bed so like I would just be laying next to her and just kind of watching her play a little bit and talking her about the game and her enthusiasm was kind of infectious like I guess she was doing a thing where she was trying to get a bunch of Pokemon in red so she could level it up and bring it into Sun and Moon yeah I guess there's some way you can do that and quick aside she was showing me all the crazy things like the error what does it error no missing no missing no that's right yeah yeah she's telling me all about these crazy glitches and stuff and then getting those all unlock so really cool to see how deep that rabbit hole went but yeah just just through being with her and everything and talking about it more I am looking forward to checking out Sun and Moon like I'm sure you know she'll get one I'll get the other will do whatever trading we can do like that'll be fun to play alongside her yeah I think Pokemon a lot of games do this but Pokemon benefits from what kind of like the MMO aspect like no one plays an MMO by themselves and I think Pokemon follows that same mindset of it definitely helps when you're all your friends are also playing Pokemon for sure yeah yeah and I have to wonder the go phenomenon I wonder how much that's gonna impact sales the son of Moon you'd have to imagine it would have some impact yeah I would I would imagine to I mean I went down to one of the more popular parks in Milwaukee and there's there was you know four hundred five hundred people in this park playing and it and you overhear conversations and you hear people mispronouncing Pokemon names are going oh look at that circle pink thing and it's a Jigglypuff like come on but like clearly they knew a little bit about Pokemon and Pokemon go is just kind of this phenomenon that that brought everyone in surely my like my podcast has gotten way more listeners just because I'm sure people went to iTunes and typed in Pokemon go and and now they see 200 episodes I've recorded but I'm sure you guys have just been slammed with like media requests of Pokemon go this Pokemon go that and I wonder how wonder if that momentum will last to the summer into the fall when these new new 3ds games come out yeah a lot of the longitude way of a go is is gonna be based on what they do to the game to add to it because you know I'm sure you've heard all the criticisms about how just the game aspects of Pokemon go aren't that you know there's not a lot to do from a videogame perspective it's more of this kind of crazy real-world scavenger hunt thing like the actual battling and stuff doesn't have a lot going on so yeah I'm kind of wondering what they add to that like they're gonna be making a ton of money so I have to wonder how big their team's gonna get how frequently they're gonna be doing updates and if they can roll this momentum into you know boosting the sales of the games even they're already talking about that movie they want to make like it feels to me as kind of an outsider to the whole Pokemon franchise that I'm hearing people talk about Pokemon maybe more than ever right now I mean I I dabble in Pokemon from week to week but it's it's crazy to see all these news outlets just constantly report on Pokemon and it's it it's weird cuz like I'm used to that I'm used to going out and finding the Pokemon news in my own I'm not used to looking at my Twitter and seeing you know 30 slightly Pokemon go related or not even just Twitter or the internet like yeah I just walk around my neighborhood and I swear like 50% of the cafes and in little restaurants and stuff around here like there's a smoothie place right next to me that says it's gonna sign out front it's like hey if you need a break from huntin Pokemon come try our new Charizard smoothie and it's it's insane like there are coffee shops that are putting down lures to try to bring people in it's it's just nuts it's it's not just the internet like this is a like social phenomenon yeah yeah and it's it's it's cool and I kind of don't want it to go away but I'm ready to stop seeing like top five hottest Pokemon professors oh yeah yeah the cafe thing is really cool but yours is just super click baby oh yeah yeah that's I mean that's the internet that's whatever it is whatever the big thing of the day is whether it's Game of Thrones or Star Wars or whatever it is you're just gonna see that on every single site that's just trying to get clicks well I have anything else really for you but a huge thanks weird that we covered we started with Pokemon we went to anxiety we went to meditation videogames more Pokemon but thank you so much Dan for coming on the show of course it was a blast thank you awesome working where can our listeners find you Giant Bomb com of course but where else just the personal stuff I tend to use just dan Reichert with no spaces since da n ry cker T definitely the most active on Twitter so if you want to follow me that's probably your best bet other than that if the anxiety talk interests of you that's on Amazon so if you just search for anxiety as an ally on Amazon that should pop up the Kindle and paperback so that's kind of the main outlets for me right now awesome and then every week we do the bomb cast goes up every Tuesday so it's like three hours long conversation about videogames pop culture food weird tangents just all sorts of stuff so give it a shot your said Taco Bell adventures yeah lots of that well when we actually before we go to break here Dan do you want to request what our Pokemon of the week should be is oh I get to take any one of the Pokemon anyone let me go with isn't golden the one that you get in Smash Brothers and I just flops around yes then it's golden alright we will be back with a Pokemon of the week which will be golden again thank you so much Dan for being on anytime it was great and we will be right back
