of these dating apps nowadays they link (1:23 - 1:26)

the instagram photos to see what they're (1:31 - 1:33)

how come every time i pull up a guy (1:33 - 1:39)
that i'm interested in dating and go to (1:37 - 1:40)
his instagram (1:39 - 1:43)
it's like every photo liked by greg (1:40 - 1:44)
leatherman (1:43 - 1:48)
do you know everybody in this city (1:44 - 1:51)
look i am your (1:48 - 1:54)
frontline interviewer i am there (1:51 - 1:56)
i sort through people if i've liked (1:54 - 1:57)
their instagram (1:56 - 2:00)
generally they're a decent person (1:57 - 2:03)
or they're cute mostly they're a decent (2:00 - 2:05)
person chances are that i've met them (2:03 - 2:08)
for sure well i mean the dude that (2:05 - 2:09)
canceled me this on (2:08 - 2:12)
me this morning wasn't a decent person (2:09 - 2:16)
well who was it send it to me in text (2:12 - 2:18)
this is not the big news we were (2:16 - 2:20)
starting off with i will oh what's the (2:18 - 2:21)
big news what's the big news (2:20 - 2:22)
although greg knowing everyone in (2:21 - 2:25)
minnesota is not surprising true no (2:22 - 2:27)
two things before we get to the big news (2:25 - 2:28)
number one is (2:27 - 2:31)
uh look i don't what would you want from (2:28 - 2:32)
me (2:31 - 2:34)
um number one i want you to keep your (2:32 - 2:35)
promises (2:34 - 2:38)
number one is there is a shiny amungus (2:35 - 2:40)
distribution happening right now (2:38 - 2:43)
by the time alert yes yeah yeah by the (2:40 - 2:44)
expires tomorrow (2:43 - 2:47)
yeah it expires tomorrow did you get it (2:44 - 2:47)
yeah (2:47 - 2:50)
i totally got it this morning i gotta (2:47 - 2:52)
remember to do that when we're done (2:50 - 2:52)
recording (2:52 - 2:56)
fires at like 8 a.m uh (2:52 - 2:59)
california time 11 a.m eastern time so (2:56 - 3:00)
if you listen to this right when it (2:59 - 3:01)
drops and you're in north america (3:00 - 3:03)
you should be able to redeem it on (3:01 - 3:05)
august 10th (3:03 - 3:08)
otherwise i think it's like 5 p.m uh (3:05 - 3:11)
uk time and then it's like midnight (3:08 - 3:12)
japan time (3:11 - 3:15)
look it's based off utc or not utc (3:12 - 3:17)
no it's not based off utc i'm sorry it's (3:15 - 3:20)
based off of uh midnight in korea (3:17 - 3:22)
which i think lines up with midnight in (3:20 - 3:24)
which is like an hour off (3:22 - 3:26)
from japan something like that that (3:24 - 3:27)
amungus is available (3:26 - 3:31)
it is the amungus that won (3:27 - 3:34)
the seniors cup division i don't have (3:31 - 3:35)
these notes in front of me (3:34 - 3:39)
seniors cup in last year i believe (3:35 - 3:41)
so this would make sense because the (3:39 - 3:43)
players cup is going on right now (3:41 - 3:47)
also this upcoming weekend was supposed (3:43 - 3:48)
to be (3:47 - 3:51)
the world championships so them giving a (3:48 - 3:52)
pokemon from the last world's (3:51 - 3:53)
championships (3:52 - 3:57)
makes sense although here we are (3:53 - 3:59)
that didn't happen the other thing that (3:57 - 4:01)
didn't happen (3:59 - 4:02)
that will be ending probably by the time (4:01 - 4:04)
this podcast goes up (4:02 - 4:07)
is that every august there is an event (4:04 - 4:09)
in japan called pikachu (4:07 - 4:12)
outbreak and that also didn't happen (4:09 - 4:14)
do both events didn't happen due to (4:12 - 4:16)
covet but they (4:14 - 4:19)
made pichu pikachu raichu (4:16 - 4:22)
and alolan raichu and a one percent (4:19 - 4:24)
chance for mimikyu (4:22 - 4:27)
spawning in raids from thursday (4:24 - 4:30)
to sunday and in five (4:27 - 4:34)
star raids there was an eight percent (4:30 - 4:37)
chance for pikachu to be shiny (4:34 - 4:40)
uh which is better than the waylord (4:37 - 4:41)
event which was a (4:40 - 4:44)
two percent chance very similar to the (4:41 - 4:45)
magikarp (4:44 - 4:47)
event which was also eight percent the (4:45 - 4:48)
difference is pikachu could only be (4:47 - 4:49)
shiny in (4:48 - 4:51)
five star raids i believe magikarp could (4:49 - 4:53)
be shiny in any star raid (4:51 - 4:55)
uh that being said that was to celebrate (4:53 - 4:57)
the pikachu uh likely to (4:55 - 4:59)
celebrate pikachu outbreak i don't think (4:57 - 5:01)
they came and said that (4:59 - 5:03)
i'm pretty sure exactly one week ago on (5:01 - 5:05)
the show we said (5:03 - 5:06)
there's probably gonna be another event (5:05 - 5:08)
right because probably (5:06 - 5:12)
the raids this month are very lackluster (5:08 - 5:14)
and they did it they they they announced (5:12 - 5:16)
it on uh (5:14 - 5:18)
the twitter and didn't one place (5:16 - 5:19)
announce it wrong (5:18 - 5:22)
oh we'll get to that the website okay (5:19 - 5:22)
and (5:22 - 5:25)
um instead of doing just saturday and (5:22 - 5:27)
sunday they did thursday friday saturday (5:25 - 5:29)
sunday which i think is a way better (5:27 - 5:33)
way to do that although again i don't (5:29 - 5:36)
uh um the pokemon why is everything the (5:33 - 5:37)
same weekend (5:36 - 5:40)
we're gonna do don't even get me oh my (5:37 - 5:41)
gosh we're gonna do community day (5:40 - 5:43)
we're gonna do pikachu we're gonna do (5:41 - 5:45)
the players cup (5:43 - 5:47)
we're gonna there's nothing pokemon (5:45 - 5:48)
masters this weekend think (5:47 - 5:50)
thank goodness well then see what are (5:48 - 5:54)
you complaining about there's too much (5:50 - 5:56)
i so i will say that i almost skipped (5:54 - 5:58)
community today and the only reason why (5:56 - 5:59)
i actually i only did it because i was (5:58 - 6:01)
actually meeting a friend to go (5:59 - 6:04)
hang out outside six feet apart uh (6:01 - 6:05)
because we haven't seen each other in a (6:04 - 6:06)
year (6:05 - 6:08)
uh so while we're sitting six feet apart (6:06 - 6:10)
i just had my phone open and was (6:08 - 6:13)
not moving just tossing to get magikarp (6:10 - 6:15)
uh otherwise i was gonna skip it because (6:13 - 6:17)
i'm kind of burnt out on the whole (6:15 - 6:18)
community today thing (6:17 - 6:20)
uh because there's too much going on but (6:18 - 6:21)
they do like to overlap (6:20 - 6:23)
and it's frustrating because i want to (6:21 - 6:25)
play i want to get my (6:23 - 6:27)
surfing alolan raichu and maybe a shiny (6:25 - 6:29)
pikachu (6:27 - 6:30)
i want to do all those things but you (6:29 - 6:32)
can't do everything (6:30 - 6:34)
well you can if you just if pokemon is (6:32 - 6:36)
number one in your life (6:34 - 6:40)
it's not i guess family is number two (6:36 - 6:42)
my dog ate a squirrel what are you a (6:40 - 6:45)
whole squirrel (6:42 - 6:45)
we're not sure how much the squirrel (6:45 - 6:50)
goblin swallowed hole (6:48 - 6:54)
well that's our show for you guys today (6:50 - 6:57)
we just know it happened let's actually (6:54 - 6:59)
get into the news here (6:57 - 7:02)
so we'll start with the what greg (6:59 - 7:04)
brought up the japanese twitter slash (7:02 - 7:05)
website slash (7:04 - 7:07)
the little in news notification on the (7:05 - 7:08)
switch (7:07 - 7:11)
that no one ever checks why would you (7:08 - 7:13)
yeah well i mean it shows up kind of (7:11 - 7:15)
when you like open your switch but i (7:13 - 7:16)
don't think anyone's looking at the (7:15 - 7:17)
screen i think they're just tapping a as (7:16 - 7:18)
fast as possible (7:17 - 7:20)
as fast as possible i have to hit it (7:18 - 7:22)
three times to get in to play my game (7:20 - 7:24)
for no (7:22 - 7:27)
reason they they said that the event (7:24 - 7:29)
that hey there's a pikachu event if (7:27 - 7:31)
you're lucky trainers you may get a (7:29 - 7:32)
shiny pikachu (7:31 - 7:34)
there was a data miner i can't remember (7:32 - 7:36)
their name i made a i made a graphic (7:34 - 7:38)
about it but the data miner posted that (7:36 - 7:40)
only pikachu was affected for this event (7:38 - 7:42)
the five star pikachu we mentioned (7:40 - 7:44)
earlier but all of the switch (7:42 - 7:47)
the japanese twitter they said that it (7:44 - 7:49)
went until august (7:47 - 7:51)
9th if you were playing the po if you (7:49 - 7:53)
were playing and you saw this (7:51 - 7:56)
on thursday evening because obviously (7:53 - 7:57)
japan is in the future (7:56 - 8:00)
so you know our 7 p.m central time in (7:57 - 8:00)
japan (8:00 - 8:03)
in america is like noon or something in (8:00 - 8:04)
japan (8:03 - 8:06)
so they posted their update they posted (8:04 - 8:07)
their information (8:06 - 8:09)
and then you know we have to wait until (8:07 - 8:11)
the next morning we'll have to wait till (8:09 - 8:12)
friday morning because no one's working (8:11 - 8:13)
in america (8:12 - 8:16)
well no one with an office job is work (8:13 - 8:18)
well maybe some people are (8:16 - 8:19)
uh working with an office job at like (8:18 - 8:21)
7pm so you have to wait till they get in (8:19 - 8:22)
the office (8:21 - 8:24)
in over in seattle and then they post (8:22 - 8:25)
the information (8:24 - 8:28)
and they posted on their website (8:25 - 8:30)
pokemon.com (8:28 - 8:33)
discover pikachu raichu pichu and max (8:30 - 8:33)
ray battles (8:33 - 8:35)
start searching for those pokemon dems (8:33 - 8:37)
the pikachu mass (8:35 - 8:39)
appearance event ends runs through (8:37 - 8:40)
august (8:39 - 8:44)
16th so we have the nintendo switch (8:40 - 8:45)
we have the japanese twitter saying (8:44 - 8:49)
august 9th and we have pokemon.com (8:45 - 8:52)
an official source of news saying august (8:49 - 8:53)
16th (8:52 - 8:56)
then like 5 p.m on friday (8:53 - 8:58)
the play pokemon twitter and then also (8:56 - 9:00)
an official (8:58 - 9:03)
twitter so the the website article went (9:00 - 9:05)
up at like what 10 a.m 11 a.m (9:03 - 9:07)
because when i posted i already made my (9:05 - 9:09)
graphic based off the japanese twitter (9:07 - 9:12)
i posted my graphic and then i was like (9:09 - 9:13)
oh pokemon.com (9:12 - 9:14)
published the article let me just make (9:13 - 9:16)
sure everything's good and then they (9:14 - 9:19)
they said august 16th and i was like (9:16 - 9:21)
well sarah b and everyone else is saying (9:19 - 9:22)
august 9th (9:21 - 9:23)
the official pokemon website is saying (9:22 - 9:25)
august 16th (9:23 - 9:28)
i don't know who to believe (9:25 - 9:28)
you would think that out of everything (9:28 - 9:32)
you can post (9:31 - 9:35)
the a date is like pretty universal (9:32 - 9:36)
right like i know (9:35 - 9:38)
in like britain they put like the the (9:36 - 9:40)
day before the month (9:38 - 9:42)
it's like everywhere else in the world (9:40 - 9:43)
don't just blame that on britain it's (9:42 - 9:44)
more like (9:43 - 9:47)
you know in the u.s they put the month (9:44 - 9:48)
before the day (9:47 - 9:50)
yeah and that's the only place where we (9:48 - 9:51)
do that (9:50 - 9:54)
but to add a whole extra week so the (9:51 - 9:56)
website goes the 16th (9:54 - 9:59)
then several hours later play pokemon (9:56 - 10:02)
says where there's a pikachu event (9:59 - 10:05)
running till the 9th who posted this (10:02 - 10:05)
article (10:05 - 10:08)
no no no no the prob the problem is the (10:05 - 10:11)
the website was using metric time yeah (10:08 - 10:14)
and it was just as a fluke and then (10:11 - 10:15)
everybody else was using regular time (10:14 - 10:18)
right the next day i believe saturday (10:15 - 10:19)
morning (10:18 - 10:20)
because they posted originally on the (10:19 - 10:23)
website on friday and then on saturday (10:20 - 10:24)
morning i rechecked (10:23 - 10:26)
it says start searching for those (10:24 - 10:28)
pokemon dens the pikachu mass appearance (10:26 - 10:30)
event goes to august 9th (10:28 - 10:32)
correction an early version of the (10:30 - 10:33)
article incorrectly the state of the end (10:32 - 10:35)
date for the 16th we apologize for the (10:33 - 10:37)
error so they did (10:35 - 10:40)
correct it they did update it i noticed (10:37 - 10:41)
although this wasn't probably that big (10:40 - 10:43)
of a deal like two months ago when there (10:41 - 10:45)
was a road time event (10:43 - 10:46)
do you remember when they put like (10:45 - 10:47)
competitive pokemon in raids it was like (10:46 - 10:49)
rotom draggapult (10:47 - 10:52)
excadrill yes it was the greatest day of (10:49 - 10:53)
my life (10:52 - 10:56)
they the website said like oh you get (10:53 - 10:58)
heat rotom and this and you get washed (10:56 - 11:00)
in that they actually flipped it (10:58 - 11:02)
and every time the this is the second (11:00 - 11:03)
time at least in the last couple months (11:02 - 11:06)
i remember pokemon.com having an issue (11:03 - 11:09)
and i tweeted at them and i that time (11:06 - 11:12)
with the road time and i cc'd (11:09 - 11:14)
one of the people i know that work with (11:12 - 11:16)
communication at pokemon (11:14 - 11:18)
and magically the website just said (11:16 - 11:20)
instead of saying like wash rotom and (11:18 - 11:21)
shield and (11:20 - 11:24)
heat rotom and sword it randomly said (11:21 - 11:28)
you'll find rotoms in both games (11:24 - 11:29)
i'm not saying that my tweets (11:28 - 11:30)
specifically did that i'm just saying (11:29 - 11:32)
that (11:30 - 11:34)
they they there was an error and they (11:32 - 11:36)
corrected it although they didn't have (11:34 - 11:36)
an (11:36 - 11:39)
a correction like they do with this one (11:36 - 11:39)
was (11:39 - 11:41)
maybe maybe there was the only thing i (11:39 - 11:42)
can think of (11:41 - 11:44)
there was discussion of making this (11:42 - 11:46)
event longer and then they said no we (11:44 - 11:48)
can't make it longer because there's (11:46 - 11:50)
another event coming (11:48 - 11:51)
yeah we can't make it longer because (11:50 - 11:53)
steve keeps complaining that there's too (11:51 - 11:54)
many things going on (11:53 - 11:56)
so we gotta cut everything short so (11:54 - 11:57)
there's no overlap (11:56 - 12:00)
correct thanks steve well i'm assuming (11:57 - 12:02)
there would be another event (12:00 - 12:05)
supposed to be coming will what because (12:02 - 12:07)
this weekend (12:05 - 12:09)
steve i'm trying to give them the (12:07 - 12:11)
benefit of the doubt of why there was an (12:09 - 12:12)
error here (12:11 - 12:14)
never give a company the benefit of the (12:12 - 12:16)
doubt tear it down and start new (12:14 - 12:19)
quest now frauds if you can't get your (12:16 - 12:20)

yeah i think you're right they're going (13:44 - 13:49)
to release new gallerian forms (13:46 - 13:53)
all right let's uh get carried away here (13:49 - 13:53)
what okay so given the fact that they'll (13:54 - 13:58)
just shove something in max raid dens (13:56 - 14:01)
what is the most likely thing to go into (13:58 - 14:03)
max ray den's four worlds (14:01 - 14:07)
ooh shiny togekiss (14:03 - 14:10)
uh you know i bet um i was gonna say (14:07 - 14:11)
maybe they put the (14:10 - 14:13)
score bunny grookie sabble in max droid (14:11 - 14:15)
dens oh (14:13 - 14:17)
with hidden ability yeah potential yeah (14:15 - 14:19)
oh i could see that (14:17 - 14:21)
because well but they want they want (14:19 - 14:22)
people to subscribe well i guess it (14:21 - 14:23)
doesn't matter i was going to say (14:22 - 14:24)
originally they distributed this to at (14:23 - 14:27)
home but at this point they're bred and (14:24 - 14:28)
fed (14:27 - 14:31)
everywhere like at this point the (14:28 - 14:33)
the those rabbits have gotten out of the (14:31 - 14:34)
cage (14:33 - 14:36)
multiplied in two more multiplied into (14:34 - 14:39)
many many things although surprisingly (14:36 - 14:42)
it's it surprises me how often really (14:39 - 14:43)
boom is showing up now because of that (14:42 - 14:44)
grassy grassy (14:43 - 14:47)
grassy grassy glide to anyone that said (14:44 - 14:49)
incineroar was the worst thing in sun (14:47 - 14:50)
and moon (14:49 - 14:54)
competitively really boom is 10 times (14:50 - 14:55)
worse (14:54 - 15:00)
hey is it as bad as ally switch (14:55 - 15:03)
look ally switches is the worst (15:00 - 15:06)
i'm not saying gorillapod is the worst (15:03 - 15:07)
but ally switch is definitely (15:06 - 15:10)
the worst thing what is ally switch is (15:07 - 15:12)
that where you can just swap sides (15:10 - 15:16)
yeah yeah so you go to like max rockfall (15:12 - 15:16)
of (15:16 - 15:19)
cinderease and then the dust clops ally (15:16 - 15:19)
switch so the (15:19 - 15:22)
max rock followed the dust collapse and (15:19 - 15:24)
then number one two damage (15:22 - 15:27)
the pokemon's name is cinderache yes my (15:24 - 15:27)
music (15:27 - 15:29)
i really wish you would get it right (15:27 - 15:30)
we've been telling you this for a while (15:29 - 15:34)
number two get good scrub (15:30 - 15:37)
noob ah speaking of competitive episode (15:34 - 15:43)
seven of pokemon twilight wings (15:37 - 15:43)
is available it is it's a thing (15:43 - 15:49)
that series what happened uh i have not (15:47 - 15:52)
seen it yet so i can't comment (15:49 - 15:54)
have you seen any of it yeah i've been (15:52 - 15:55)
doing every okay (15:54 - 15:58)
patreon i you know i pay for the patreon (15:55 - 16:00)
and for some reason i don't see those (15:58 - 16:04)
so i did something wrong so (16:00 - 16:05)
greg it sounds like you didn't like the (16:04 - 16:08)
series it was just boring (16:05 - 16:10)
like they were slightly interesting (16:08 - 16:12)
slices of life (16:10 - 16:14)
but little more than that does that (16:12 - 16:15)
people want an anime they want that (16:14 - 16:17)
slice of life anime isn't a huge (16:15 - 16:20)
market it would have been better if they (16:17 - 16:21)
were (16:20 - 16:24)
longer so you could see more (16:21 - 16:27)
story develop otherwise it was just like (16:24 - 16:30)
a seven minute problem that was solved (16:27 - 16:31)
in seven minutes (16:30 - 16:34)
and usually it was a very surface level (16:31 - 16:35)
problem (16:34 - 16:39)
that was easily solved i mean they're (16:35 - 16:42)
they're cute but otherwise it's not like (16:39 - 16:45)
i i don't have the same feeling to show (16:42 - 16:46)
them as it did for origins i thought (16:45 - 16:48)
origins was really well i thought (16:46 - 16:49)
generations was really well like (16:48 - 16:53)
they took they took parts of the game (16:49 - 16:54)
and expanded it (16:53 - 16:57)
and here they just took people and gave (16:54 - 16:58)
them really slight stories (16:57 - 17:00)
and they're interesting and it was well (16:58 - 17:03)
animated but otherwise it was just like (17:00 - 17:06)
okay i have no desire to go watch (17:03 - 17:08)
any of these again yeah i can see (17:06 - 17:10)
they're pretty forgettable (17:08 - 17:12)
yeah i feel like i would put on origins (17:10 - 17:14)
again yeah i would put on origins again (17:12 - 17:15)
and i have multiple times (17:14 - 17:17)
some more news off pokemon.com encounter (17:15 - 17:18)

soul rock ball toy bronze or an lgm (18:01 - 18:07)
frequently appearing in the wild if (18:04 - 18:08)

clefa igly buff lunatone soul rock lgm (18:08 - 18:12)
are hatching out of 7k (18:11 - 18:15)
egg star u now has the possibility of (18:12 - 18:17)
being shiny (18:15 - 18:19)
raid battles will feature claytol (18:17 - 18:20)
bronzong (18:19 - 18:23)
lgm uh you'll also have a rare (18:20 - 18:25)
opportunity to (18:23 - 18:28)
battle unknown u l t r (18:25 - 18:31)
and a in raid battles uh these you (18:28 - 18:32)
should be able to do yourself you (18:31 - 18:34)
probably don't need a group i mean it's (18:32 - 18:36)
unknown they got one move (18:34 - 18:39)
kind of good stats and then the mythical (18:36 - 18:41)
pokemon deoxis (18:39 - 18:44)
will appear in its normal form in five (18:41 - 18:45)
star raids and if you're (18:44 - 18:48)
lucky as always trainers you may (18:45 - 18:49)
encounter (18:48 - 18:53)
a shiny deoxys i haven't yet (18:49 - 18:56)
me either uh this will go till friday (18:53 - 19:00)

following week will be the (19:03 - 19:07)
unova week which will have um bouvelant (19:04 - 19:11)
in new york uh so waddle or sea waddle (19:07 - 19:13)
i'm not sure how to say that one yet (19:11 - 19:17)
so waddle uh because it sews yes (19:13 - 19:20)
exactly i think i put too much evidence (19:17 - 19:21)
of (19:20 - 19:24)
f emphasis on the sew part (19:21 - 19:27)
so it doesn't sound natural you put the (19:24 - 19:30)
emphasis on the wrong syllable (19:27 - 19:32)
and then genesect will be appearing next (19:30 - 19:34)
week in raid battles and it will be (19:32 - 19:37)
a chance for shiny which is very good (19:34 - 19:38)
for non-japanese players (19:37 - 19:41)
since genesis was only distributed in (19:38 - 19:42)
japan as a shiny (19:41 - 19:44)
how was your guys's magikarp will didn't (19:42 - 19:46)
do it (19:44 - 19:49)
well i intended to (19:46 - 19:52)
i tried i tried and will had an entire (19:49 - 19:54)
conversation without me (19:52 - 19:56)
i mean i had an entire conversation with (19:54 - 19:57)
myself (19:56 - 20:01)
that i imagined you were aware of (19:57 - 20:01)
look kids this coronavirus is real bad (20:03 - 20:09)
we've been locked in our house for a (20:07 - 20:10)
while um (20:09 - 20:12)
i didn't i didn't buy the ticket i (20:10 - 20:14)
didn't pay the (20:12 - 20:16)
dollar thing to do i just didn't want to (20:14 - 20:17)
invest that much (20:16 - 20:20)
into it i met a friend who hadn't seen (20:17 - 20:21)
in a while so i just sat in a park with (20:20 - 20:22)
them (20:21 - 20:25)
so that we could safely uh socialize and (20:22 - 20:27)
while we were socializing for two hours (20:25 - 20:30)
i did magikarp day i got like i got a (20:27 - 20:32)
surprising amount of (20:30 - 20:34)
shinies i think i got eight in the two (20:32 - 20:35)
hours that i did it (20:34 - 20:37)
it was fine i didn't do all the things i (20:35 - 20:39)
was just like (20:37 - 20:42)
i felt the burnout like i've done so (20:39 - 20:44)
many community days it feels like it's (20:42 - 20:45)
been (20:44 - 20:47)
every other weekend where it was like go (20:45 - 20:48)
fest and community day and then (20:47 - 20:50)
community day and i was just like i'm (20:48 - 20:51)
tired (20:50 - 20:53)
i don't care about magikarp i don't care (20:51 - 20:55)
about (20:53 - 20:58)
how good the gyarados would be in the (20:55 - 20:59)
part i like (20:58 - 21:01)
the lease which is gym battles and pvp (20:59 - 21:02)
so (21:01 - 21:05)
it i just did it half heartedly and it (21:02 - 21:06)
was fine (21:05 - 21:08)
like there was good spawns it was a good (21:06 - 21:10)
spawn rate i got (21:08 - 21:13)
i think it ended with 900 uh (21:10 - 21:15)
magikarp candies that i used to evolve (21:13 - 21:17)
to (21:15 - 21:20)
two carps and i called it today (21:17 - 21:23)
yeah i think the thing for me was number (21:20 - 21:23)
one (21:23 - 21:26)
for me community day is primarily just (21:23 - 21:28)
an excuse to go and see greg (21:26 - 21:31)
yes but then like number two it was (21:28 - 21:32)
magikarp (21:31 - 21:35)
i already have shiny magikarp yeah i (21:32 - 21:36)
mean i (21:35 - 21:39)
like so many in other games too (21:36 - 21:41)
i know it's just like it it literally it (21:39 - 21:43)
was like it's not worth getting out of (21:41 - 21:45)
bed for four magikarp (21:43 - 21:48)
i had a different goal while everyone (21:45 - 21:50)
wanted as many shinies as possible i (21:48 - 21:51)
wanted to get the (21:50 - 21:54)
catch 300 big magikarp medal (21:51 - 21:56)
in pokemon i got 50. you don't have that (21:54 - 21:57)
already (21:56 - 21:59)
no i i started the day i think with a (21:57 - 22:00)
hundred (21:59 - 22:04)
and nineteen big magikarp 120 big (22:00 - 22:05)
magikarp maybe (22:04 - 22:07)
i'm not in a water biome so like i (22:05 - 22:09)
barely see water pokemon unless (22:07 - 22:12)
i i'm like i'm in a water biome are you (22:09 - 22:14)
i don't know i didn't was dc in a water (22:12 - 22:15)
biome (22:14 - 22:18)
i used there used to be a fountain by my (22:15 - 22:19)
house in dc (22:18 - 22:21)
so when i would walk my dog uh there was (22:19 - 22:22)
always a magikarp there (22:21 - 22:24)
so it's like i literally got a magikarp (22:22 - 22:27)
a day if not multiple magikarps a day (22:24 - 22:30)
so yeah i never ever see magic carp (22:27 - 22:32)
unless i go to like the like front (22:30 - 22:35)
which is 10 000 lakes we have two big (22:32 - 22:36)
rivers (22:35 - 22:39)
we see magikarp plenty here yeah i don't (22:36 - 22:40)
see a lot of magikarp (22:39 - 22:42)
i think i like i i ended the day with (22:40 - 22:44)
160 (22:42 - 22:46)
out of 300 big magikarp so i guess in (22:44 - 22:48)
this five hours i played i only got 40 (22:46 - 22:52)
big magikarp so that's a bit of a bummer (22:48 - 22:55)
only 140 more to go to get that (22:52 - 22:56)
fisherman vest (22:55 - 22:57)
do you already have the boots and (22:56 - 22:59)
everything no because i'm not going to (22:57 - 23:00)
buy the outfit until i get the whole (22:59 - 23:02)
outfit (23:00 - 23:04)
the fest is five dollars on its own it's (23:02 - 23:06)
a weird thing in games (23:04 - 23:08)
yes this is what this is what i love is (23:06 - 23:09)
you have to earn the right (23:08 - 23:12)
to spend your money yeah that's so weird (23:09 - 23:14)
that was a thing of destiny too i don't (23:12 - 23:16)
know if you remember that will (23:14 - 23:19)
it was like you had to do the the whole (23:16 - 23:20)
year event of like (23:19 - 23:22)
do all these things before the to (23:20 - 23:23)
celebrate one year of destiny and then (23:22 - 23:25)
if you do it (23:23 - 23:29)
you get to spend 20 on a shirt (23:25 - 23:29)
i mean i'm going to tell you this (23:31 - 23:36)
next weekend i will do very little (23:34 - 23:38)

quests happens (24:11 - 24:15)
in this patch and then they promise a (24:12 - 24:15)
bigger (24:15 - 24:18)
chunk i think the next big chunk is in (24:15 - 24:19)
5'4 (24:18 - 24:22)
but um they fixed a lot of it because (24:19 - 24:22)

to do remote raids (25:04 - 25:08)
and i don't i i don't want to travel a (25:05 - 25:09)
lot (25:08 - 25:12)

five people who are on at the same time (25:12 - 25:15)
and coordinated (25:14 - 25:18)
it's been pretty easy in the slack to (25:15 - 25:19)
coordinate five people (25:18 - 25:21)
usually i just post like hey i got a (25:19 - 25:23)
deoxys in five minutes who's (25:21 - 25:26)
wants to do it yeah that requires me to (25:23 - 25:30)

like you guys were doing remote raids (25:33 - 25:37)
last night right (25:36 - 25:39)
yeah i think uh greg and i did like two (25:37 - 25:40)
together yeah (25:39 - 25:42)
when i was literally at the skate park (25:40 - 25:44)

problem (26:28 - 26:31)
we have too many lives for raids okay so (26:28 - 26:32)
even even if (26:31 - 26:35)
if deoxys at this point isn't this is (26:32 - 26:37)
this is the dilemma (26:35 - 26:39)
it's not my destiny deoxys is not my (26:37 - 26:41)
destiny there you go (26:39 - 26:43)
okay so like let's let's just say this (26:41 - 26:44)
was shiny me too (26:43 - 26:46)
right you got plenty of ways to hunt (26:44 - 26:47)
shiny me too (26:46 - 26:50)
ultra sun ultra moon software setting (26:47 - 26:51)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee software (26:50 - 26:52)
setting (26:51 - 26:55)
fire red leaf green software setting you (26:52 - 26:57)
have multiple games (26:55 - 27:00)
um so ultimately if you own those games (26:57 - 27:01)
the cost of getting them you two is (27:00 - 27:05)
free minus your time in pokemon go (27:01 - 27:08)
i have now spent over 30 dollars (27:05 - 27:11)
on raid passes specifically (27:08 - 27:15)
to get shiny deoxys because i do want (27:11 - 27:17)
shiny dioxis i want it (27:15 - 27:20)
it's for me it is very difficult to be (27:17 - 27:21)
motivated (27:20 - 27:24)
motivated to do anything in pokemon go (27:21 - 27:25)
because (27:24 - 27:27)
it is still not linked to pokemon home (27:25 - 27:28)
and it's like (27:27 - 27:30)
if i could get a shiny and poke shiny (27:28 - 27:32)
dioxis in pokemon go that i could then (27:30 - 27:34)
transfer into my pokemon home (27:32 - 27:35)
and have it as part of my collection i'd (27:34 - 27:37)
be heck yeah i'd be like i'd be calling (27:35 - 27:38)
you guys every day let's do that right (27:37 - 27:39)
let's (27:38 - 27:41)
that what's his name that's the goal (27:39 - 27:42)
right like i'm going to get the (27:41 - 27:44)
chinese before the week and then i'm (27:42 - 27:46)
going to wait and then i'm going to (27:44 - 27:47)
transfer it (27:46 - 27:50)
well but i i i live in the moment (27:47 - 27:52)
i live for today not for tomorrow i but (27:50 - 27:53)
i would like literally like (27:52 - 27:55)
i'd be hitting up that what is his name (27:53 - 27:57)
jake in in liverpool (27:55 - 27:59)
uh i'd be like dude yeah i'll do these (27:57 - 28:00)
remote raids for you in the middle of (27:59 - 28:01)
the night or (28:00 - 28:04)
in the middle of my work day but no i i (28:01 - 28:07)
i have no call for it because (28:04 - 28:09)
they don't even have a timeline of like (28:07 - 28:12)
that's true within the next six months (28:09 - 28:14)
i it's frustrating and i get that it's (28:12 - 28:17)
luck like i'm at like 30 60 accesses (28:14 - 28:19)
four of those were like free because the (28:17 - 28:20)
raid passes (28:19 - 28:24)
the daily raid passes and then what is a (28:20 - 28:25)
remote raid it's like (28:24 - 28:27)
two dollars and fifty cents for three of (28:25 - 28:28)
them (28:27 - 28:32)
and then if you buy uh (28:28 - 28:34)
the gift box or whatever you get like (28:32 - 28:35)
it's like (28:34 - 28:38)
16 and you get like 18 passes or (28:35 - 28:41)
so it's like about 30 i've spent on raid (28:38 - 28:43)
passes and besides the fact that like i (28:41 - 28:44)
genuinely like pokemon (28:43 - 28:46)
go and i'm doing this with other people (28:44 - 28:48)
and i'm able to do with people in slack (28:46 - 28:49)
or discord or watching the twitch (28:48 - 28:50)
streams and (28:49 - 28:52)
that's fun i still can't help but think (28:50 - 28:54)
that at this point now (28:52 - 28:56)
the access has cost me half of a copy of (28:54 - 28:58)
sword and shield (28:56 - 29:01)
yeah it's a lot of money uh but also (28:58 - 29:03)
there's like a i'm gonna save that money (29:01 - 29:06)
for gardenscapes a game with real values (29:03 - 29:10)
yeah i can't even finish that but also i (29:06 - 29:10)
think there is like a time (29:11 - 29:17)
value of is it worth your time (29:13 - 29:20)
like for for shiny articuno in let's go (29:17 - 29:22)
pikachu let's go eevee (29:20 - 29:25)
that took over a hundred hours for me (29:22 - 29:28)
yeah but that was also a hundred hours (29:25 - 29:29)
of (29:28 - 29:31)
what you do for a living well yeah but (29:29 - 29:32)
i'm i'm trying to put my (29:31 - 29:35)
my feet into the shoes of normal people (29:32 - 29:36)
like (29:35 - 29:39)
yeah for me that's a hundred hours of (29:36 - 29:41)
hanging out with twitch chat and talking (29:39 - 29:42)
with them and it is what i do for a (29:41 - 29:43)
living but (29:42 - 29:45)
there are people who don't stream who (29:43 - 29:47)
just like to get shiny pokemon and (29:45 - 29:49)
they could be on their couch software (29:47 - 29:51)
setting for a hundred plus hours and (29:49 - 29:53)
that is also frustrating i don't know (29:51 - 29:54)
what's more (29:53 - 29:56)
but they're also not just doing that (29:54 - 29:58)
right like i've never just sat (29:56 - 30:00)
and software said it in complete silence (29:58 - 30:01)
for a hundred hours (30:00 - 30:03)
i've watched movies but you don't i've (30:01 - 30:05)
listened no i imagine all people suffer (30:03 - 30:06)
setting (30:05 - 30:08)
climb into the closet with the lights (30:06 - 30:09)
off close the door and just (30:08 - 30:11)
you know mother i need to be in my (30:09 - 30:13)
software set room close the door and (30:11 - 30:15)
slide food under for me please (30:13 - 30:17)
i mean they're doing things like (30:15 - 30:18)
software setting does not take all of (30:17 - 30:20)
your attention just like (30:18 - 30:22)
i mean i you know i'm a pseudo method (30:20 - 30:23)
almost every shiny that i have (30:22 - 30:26)
and that is me watching a movie while (30:23 - 30:27)
going around in a circle and looking (30:26 - 30:28)
down (30:27 - 30:31)
every minute and saying uh nope put it (30:28 - 30:32)
in the box (30:31 - 30:33)
there's a lot of other things the (30:32 - 30:35)
difference about pokemon go (30:33 - 30:39)
is i have to either travel somewhere (30:35 - 30:42)
or i have to wait for somebody to say (30:39 - 30:44)
okay we're gonna go do it in 20 minutes (30:42 - 30:46)
okay invites are coming out get into the (30:44 - 30:46)
invites (30:46 - 30:49)
i'm paying x amount of money to do this (30:46 - 30:53)
and then i'm playing a very poor tapping (30:49 - 30:54)
game (30:53 - 30:56)
the worst type of cookie clicker and (30:54 - 30:57)
then (30:56 - 31:01)
for a chance and it eats up (30:57 - 31:03)
a lot of time and since they're around (31:01 - 31:05)
the world i either have to (31:03 - 31:08)
sit in slack or wait for people to (31:05 - 31:10)
message me on twitter or send me a text (31:08 - 31:12)
message and hope that i'm near my phone (31:10 - 31:15)
and then log in and it is a process that (31:12 - 31:17)
doesn't exist in the real games and i (31:15 - 31:18)
find that process (31:17 - 31:21)
sometimes very frustrating like i can't (31:18 - 31:22)
soft reset that raid (31:21 - 31:25)
i get one chance and then it's i drive (31:22 - 31:26)
to the next one (31:25 - 31:29)
or i wait for somebody else to drive to (31:26 - 31:30)
the next one like there's a huge (31:29 - 31:34)
time investment where pokemon go eats up (31:30 - 31:36)
all of your attention to be able to get (31:34 - 31:38)
a chance to do this one thing (31:36 - 31:40)
and you are not only paying for it in (31:38 - 31:42)
time but you're paying for an actual (31:40 - 31:43)
cash (31:42 - 31:46)
i find it's really frustrating i find (31:43 - 31:47)
that (31:46 - 31:50)
thing frustrating it's like a long time (31:47 - 31:50)
ago like (31:50 - 31:54)
same with rayquaza i was like look if i (31:50 - 31:55)
get it i get it if i don't i don't (31:54 - 31:57)
i'll take the chances that i have but (31:55 - 31:59)
i'm not (31:57 - 32:02)
i'm not invested into having this on my (31:59 - 32:04)
phone and also it can't move anywhere (32:02 - 32:05)
right now (32:04 - 32:06)
so the only person that cares about (32:05 - 32:08)
having it is me (32:06 - 32:11)
and posting it on twitter for the four (32:08 - 32:13)
minutes that people will look at it and (32:11 - 32:16)
move on with their lives well absolutely (32:13 - 32:17)
the only time (32:16 - 32:20)
doing these kinds of raids is like (32:17 - 32:23)
real touch your heart fun (32:20 - 32:26)
and pleasure is like after pokemon go (32:23 - 32:27)
fest (32:26 - 32:29)
and it's a day and they're just like (32:27 - 32:30)
have raid after raid after raid of (32:29 - 32:32)
something really good and fun and you're (32:30 - 32:33)
like running around chicago with your (32:32 - 32:34)
buddies doing (32:33 - 32:37)
doing raids right that is a great time (32:34 - 32:38)
when it's just like (32:37 - 32:40)
the middle of the year and you're on (32:38 - 32:42)
your own in south minneapolis crying (32:40 - 32:44)
because you can't leave your house yeah (32:42 - 32:46)
that's no fun no (32:44 - 32:48)
it's not even worth a buck let alone (32:46 - 32:49)
five i'm good (32:48 - 32:53)
i'm in too deep now well you're you (32:49 - 32:55)
you are you have always been in too deep (32:53 - 32:58)
but you also have like you also have a (32:55 - 32:58)
captive (32:58 - 33:01)
audience that will show up for your (32:58 - 33:03)
remote rates (33:01 - 33:05)
yeah i guess yeah you you are you are (33:03 - 33:07)
you are right i am at a slight advantage (33:05 - 33:07)
where (33:07 - 33:10)
when i because i decided to live stream (33:07 - 33:10)
community (33:10 - 33:12)
so thank you to everyone that came out (33:10 - 33:14)
my my (33:12 - 33:17)
irl pokemon go live streams (33:14 - 33:20)
are i think i would rather work (33:17 - 33:22)
mcdonald's drive through (33:20 - 33:26)
it is (33:22 - 33:26)
i love doing them spoiler alert you can (33:26 - 33:33)
i i love doing them but they are it is (33:30 - 33:34)
the hardest (33:33 - 33:37)
thing i think i've ever done in life is (33:34 - 33:40)
to walk around in heat with a (33:37 - 33:44)
10-pound backpack with the possibility (33:40 - 33:46)
and the guarantee that there will be (33:44 - 33:49)
technical issues every 15 minutes (33:46 - 33:52)
and it is something (33:49 - 33:55)
it cannot be a twitch thing it just must (33:52 - 33:56)
be the general (33:55 - 33:59)
point of the game because the game is (33:56 - 34:00)
free (33:59 - 34:02)
and so there's such a low barrier of (34:00 - 34:04)
entry of like all these kids (34:02 - 34:07)
having access to a phone and then having (34:04 - 34:09)
access to a free game (34:07 - 34:11)
but the um the the audi and i i hate (34:09 - 34:13)
when people are like pokemon's a kids (34:11 - 34:13)
game (34:13 - 34:17)
look i play sword and shield 40 plus (34:13 - 34:17)
hours a week (34:17 - 34:21)
in front of people and yeah totally (34:17 - 34:23)
their kids love pokemon so yeah so do (34:21 - 34:24)
adults (34:23 - 34:26)
and the people who come through my come (34:24 - 34:28)
through my streams (34:26 - 34:31)
are for the most part very polite (34:28 - 34:34)
uh they provide good conversation they (34:31 - 34:34)
argue (34:34 - 34:36)
with me about how my opinions are wrong (34:34 - 34:38)
which is is is fair (34:36 - 34:42)
um they're they're they're humans (34:38 - 34:44)
when i stream pokemon go i do not get (34:42 - 34:45)
humans (34:44 - 34:49)
i get i get a (34:45 - 34:52)
what i assume to be an 11 year old that (34:49 - 34:54)
has no clue (34:52 - 34:56)
how the world works they don't know how (34:54 - 34:57)
to say hi (34:56 - 34:58)
they don't know how to say hello they (34:57 - 35:00)
don't know how to ask a question they (34:58 - 35:01)
just go (35:00 - 35:03)
this is a pokemon go stream friend code (35:01 - 35:04)
friend code for like they're just (35:03 - 35:06)
spamming their friend code (35:04 - 35:08)
uh and now we have bots set up we got to (35:06 - 35:09)
the point (35:08 - 35:11)
in my twitch stream where we have bots (35:09 - 35:12)
to detect (35:11 - 35:16)
a pokemon go friend code to then (35:12 - 35:18)
delete the friend code and then to warn (35:16 - 35:20)
the person being like (35:18 - 35:22)
hey don't share your friend codes here (35:20 - 35:23)
that's not what we're going for but they (35:22 - 35:25)
try again (35:23 - 35:27)
and then it's just people coming in (35:25 - 35:29)
being like hey i need to get into a raid (35:27 - 35:30)
i need to get into a raid (35:29 - 35:34)
look dude you're new here i'm i'm (35:30 - 35:36)
fairly competent at recognizing people's (35:34 - 35:38)
names you're not following the stream (35:36 - 35:39)
you're new here fairly competent (35:38 - 35:41)
fairly kind this is your first time here (35:39 - 35:43)
you didn't say hello the first thing you (35:41 - 35:45)
want is like (35:43 - 35:48)
i need a deoxis there's 200 plus (35:45 - 35:50)
people here i can only send five invites (35:48 - 35:52)
my friends list is full i have (35:50 - 35:54)
a bunch of subscribers that have been (35:52 - 35:56)
asking to get on my friends list (35:54 - 36:00)
for over a year they're just so (35:56 - 36:02)
and again this just doesn't happen with (36:00 - 36:04)
sword and shield it doesn't happen with (36:02 - 36:05)
let's go it doesn't happen with heart (36:04 - 36:06)
gold soul silver it's specifically (36:05 - 36:08)
pokemon go where people come in and (36:06 - 36:09)
they're like (36:08 - 36:13)
well i need the access right away front (36:09 - 36:13)
80 degrees i am my phone is slipping on (36:17 - 36:23)
my hand because i'm sweating (36:21 - 36:27)
two things here number one (36:23 - 36:28)
will anderson laugh at what you people (36:27 - 36:30)
call hot okay y'all (36:28 - 36:34)
i'm so sad for you please don't ever (36:30 - 36:36)
try to live in dc for the summer because (36:34 - 36:38)
you'll just die (36:36 - 36:41)
two there are so many more pokemon go (36:38 - 36:42)
players than (36:41 - 36:44)
any other type of pokemon game that's (36:42 - 36:46)
true that is why (36:44 - 36:49)
the audience is so drastically different (36:46 - 36:50)
because (36:49 - 36:53)
it just attracts just so (36:50 - 36:56)
many people that you're gonna get (36:53 - 36:58)
well and of course it's that venn (36:56 - 37:00)
diagram of pokemon go player (36:58 - 37:02)
and somebody who would watch somebody (37:00 - 37:05)
play pokemon go on twitch (37:02 - 37:07)
all right there's a level of desperation (37:05 - 37:08)
there that's (37:07 - 37:11)
built into the equation think about the (37:08 - 37:12)
logic of this (37:11 - 37:15)
you are playing a game where it's raids (37:12 - 37:17)
so you are intended to be outside (37:15 - 37:19)
walking around going to those raids (37:17 - 37:22)
but somehow your viewer is watching (37:19 - 37:23)
twitch (37:22 - 37:25)
so they're not outside walking around (37:23 - 37:26)
doing those raids what (37:25 - 37:29)
what is the the mind the brain that (37:26 - 37:32)
creates that situation that is your (37:29 - 37:33)
viewer there (37:32 - 37:35)
it works in this instance just because (37:33 - 37:39)
they did make it so easy to play at home (37:35 - 37:41)
right like if i was trying to do (37:39 - 37:42)
magikarp community day (37:41 - 37:45)
but it was last august i can't imagine (37:42 - 37:47)
anyone would be watching because they (37:45 - 37:47)
would be out (37:47 - 37:50)
also doing magikarp community but the (37:47 - 37:51)
fact that like (37:50 - 37:53)
niantic has made it easy to play at home (37:51 - 37:55)
and it's the middle of august (37:53 - 37:57)
and everyone's sweating i feel like a (37:55 - 37:58)
reasonable person would be like (37:57 - 38:02)
it is cold here i am cold i am literally (37:58 - 38:04)
wearing a sweatshirt and long pants (38:02 - 38:05)
because i'm so (38:04 - 38:08)
cold in minnie minneapolis in august you (38:05 - 38:09)
guys are a (38:08 - 38:12)
joke okay a reasonable human would be (38:09 - 38:13)
like (38:12 - 38:17)
hold on we are having a cold august (38:13 - 38:19)
it is normally a hundred degrees in (38:17 - 38:22)
august we are having a weird cold august (38:19 - 38:25)
so don't come at me with this nobody (38:22 - 38:27)
with his home you would never survive in (38:25 - 38:30)
dc it gets freaking hot here we have had (38:27 - 38:30)
a (38:30 - 38:33)
very cold summer i don't do good with in (38:30 - 38:35)
weather we don't do good with anything (38:33 - 38:37)
you would do better in whether if you (38:35 - 38:38)
weren't always wearing a hoodie (38:37 - 38:41)
and like four layers of clothing let's (38:38 - 38:42)
be real (38:41 - 38:44)
steve would do better in uh one of those (38:42 - 38:46)

purchase a movie ticket (59:04 - 59:07)
they sent me the code on the ticket so (59:05 - 59:09)
this is how it works we'll back up (59:07 - 59:12)
we'll explain this uh so our our (59:09 - 59:14)
listeners walk away (59:12 - 59:16)
knowing more than the common folk so in (59:14 - 59:17)
japan uh (59:16 - 59:19)
if you want to go to like a wrestling (59:17 - 59:21)
show if you want to go to a play (59:19 - 59:23)
if you want to go to a movie if you want (59:21 - 59:24)
to go to like (59:23 - 59:27)
disney land world i don't know which one (59:24 - 59:27)
is there (59:27 - 59:30)
uh it's called disney japan or something (59:27 - 59:32)
like tokyo disney (59:30 - 59:34)
yeah tokyo disney if you want to go to (59:32 - 59:35)
any of these events (59:34 - 59:38)
all you have to do is go into the (59:35 - 59:39)
thousands of 7-elevens that are (59:38 - 59:41)
literally next to each other in japan (59:39 - 59:43)
you can't walk out of a 7-eleven without (59:41 - 59:44)
seeing another 7-eleven (59:43 - 59:47)
and inside the 7-elevens are these atms (59:44 - 59:48)
they look like atms but they're (59:47 - 59:51)
they're just boxes that with a touch (59:48 - 59:53)
screen that you can buy tickets from (59:51 - 59:55)
so you walk into a 7-eleven you go to (59:53 - 59:57)
the touchscreen you go you want to (59:55 - 60:00)
go to purchase a movie ticket purchase (59:57 - 60:01)
movie ticket for coco which is the new (60:00 - 60:03)
pokemon movie coming out in japan (60:01 - 60:05)
those tickets went on sale on august 7th (60:03 - 60:07)
you purchased the ticket for (60:05 - 60:08)
i think a movie ticket there is like 10 (60:07 - 60:10)
bucks so it's like (60:08 - 60:12)
800 yen or something like that and then (60:10 - 60:13)
when you (60:12 - 60:15)
purchase it it prints it out right there (60:13 - 60:16)
and then on (60:15 - 60:19)
that receipt is your movie ticket and (60:16 - 60:20)
your code for shiny celebi and for (60:19 - 60:22)
zeroed (60:20 - 60:24)
and ever since let's go pikachu let's go (60:22 - 60:25)
eevee ever since the switch (60:24 - 60:27)
let's go pikachu and let's go evie sword (60:25 - 60:28)
and shield (60:27 - 60:33)
all are region free with with the codes (60:28 - 60:35)
um that's why i like that korean among (60:33 - 60:37)
us anyone can download (60:35 - 60:40)
uh if there was a giovanni event for (60:37 - 60:41)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee (60:40 - 60:44)
only in the u.s at best buy but if you a (60:41 - 60:45)
u.s person gave that to a japanese (60:44 - 60:47)
person they'd be able to redeem that (60:45 - 60:49)
um if you were to go to japan and get (60:47 - 60:51)
the birthday (60:49 - 60:53)
birthday evie birthday chancy i think (60:51 - 60:55)
it's chansey yeah (60:53 - 60:57)
i think it's chancy doesn't matter uh (60:55 - 60:58)
that code will still work (60:57 - 61:01)
this was different than like sun and (60:58 - 61:02)
moon (61:01 - 61:04)
and the ds stuff so when i was part of (61:02 - 61:06)
the pokemon secret club which (61:04 - 61:08)
that involved you walking into a pokemon (61:06 - 61:11)
center spending 800 yen to get a secret (61:08 - 61:11)
cub (61:11 - 61:14)
club membership and then redeem it they (61:11 - 61:16)
gave out a shiny necrozma (61:14 - 61:19)
through secret club but it would only (61:16 - 61:20)
work (61:19 - 61:23)
on a japanese version i think it (61:20 - 61:25)
oh gosh not the game it would it was (61:23 - 61:27)
specific to the (61:25 - 61:29)
the the console i think because i had to (61:27 - 61:31)
send it to a friend (61:29 - 61:34)
that had a japanese 3ds (61:31 - 61:36)
to then redeem it to then trade it to me (61:34 - 61:37)
it was very complicated (61:36 - 61:38)
but none of that none of that matters (61:37 - 61:40)
anymore it seems like all these switch (61:38 - 61:42)
games (61:40 - 61:44)
as long as you have the code secret club (61:42 - 61:47)
also gave out a shiny crabby (61:44 - 61:49)
for let's go pikachu let's go eevee (61:47 - 61:52)
which i was able to redeem no problem (61:49 - 61:56)
a couple things here if you want zarud (61:52 - 61:57)
i'm trying not to say zera aura because (61:56 - 62:00)
that keeps popping up on my mind (61:57 - 62:04)
you want zarud and shiny celebi ebay (62:00 - 62:06)
seems to be offering it for about (62:04 - 62:08)
fifteen dollars (62:06 - 62:10)
which goes back to our conversation (62:08 - 62:12)
about deoxys is deox is worth (62:10 - 62:14)
the amount of rain passes that you're (62:12 - 62:16)
putting into it (62:14 - 62:18)
i don't know it is shiny celebi worth (62:16 - 62:19)
the 15 (62:18 - 62:20)
to you so you don't have to play pokemon (62:19 - 62:22)
crystal and soft reset that (62:20 - 62:27)
yes maybe is the rude worth 15 (62:22 - 62:30)
maybe although the the (62:27 - 62:32)
this is what i would recommend if you (62:30 - 62:34)
have a friend in japan (62:32 - 62:36)
and you convince them to walk down to a (62:34 - 62:38)
7-eleven to get you a ticket (62:36 - 62:40)
it's probably going to cost them like 10 (62:38 - 62:42)
bucks but obviously people on ebay want (62:40 - 62:43)
to make a profit (62:42 - 62:45)
that's why they're charging 15. they're (62:43 - 62:46)
actually double dipping so this is what (62:45 - 62:47)
happens with a person on (62:46 - 62:51)
an ebay they buy the movie ticket they (62:47 - 62:53)
sell the code separately on ebay and (62:51 - 62:55)
then they sell the movie ticket (62:53 - 62:57)
again back to somebody who wants to see (62:55 - 62:58)
the movie but doesn't care about the (62:57 - 62:59)
codes (62:58 - 63:01)
at a cheaper price than they would buy (62:59 - 63:03)
the they got it made (63:01 - 63:06)
it's fine who wants to see the movie (63:03 - 63:07)
without the code (63:06 - 63:11)
yeah parents i don't know i mean (63:07 - 63:14)
parents there's the power of us like (63:11 - 63:17)
we it's out there that stinker that we (63:14 - 63:18)
have no faith in the (63:17 - 63:21)
movie franchise any longer (63:18 - 63:21)
if i'm choking over here (63:23 - 63:30)
if you go the ebay route and you decide (63:27 - 63:31)
that you cannot wait you want chinese (63:30 - 63:33)
celebi you want zarud if you decide to (63:31 - 63:35)
go the ebay route (63:33 - 63:38)
only purchase from a seller that says (63:35 - 63:39)
they will (63:38 - 63:42)
send you a code it will read the (63:39 - 63:43)
description (63:42 - 63:46)
if they send you a code that's fine also (63:43 - 63:47)
if they're charging like three bucks (63:46 - 63:48)
it's (63:47 - 63:52)
uh it's it's hacked if the seller says (63:48 - 63:54)
we will trade you the zarood and the (63:52 - 63:55)
celebi after (63:54 - 63:59)
you pay those are hacked pk hexed (63:55 - 64:02)
duplicated holding a master ball perfect (63:59 - 64:03)
ivs i cannot (64:02 - 64:06)
here's here's some good signs zarud and (64:03 - 64:08)
celebi only three perfect ivs (64:06 - 64:10)
guaranteed not six not five not four (64:08 - 64:11)
three (64:10 - 64:13)
the rood will be holding leftovers (64:11 - 64:15)
celebi will be holding lucky eggs (64:13 - 64:17)
not master balls they will have to have (64:15 - 64:19)
that ribbon it's like i don't remember (64:17 - 64:20)
what the ribbon is called it's like a (64:19 - 64:21)
red (64:20 - 64:23)
ribbon they're in cherish balls they (64:21 - 64:25)
both come at level 60 (64:23 - 64:28)
so again any ebay auction that says (64:25 - 64:29)
level 100 (64:28 - 64:32)
it's a rude from the movie holding (64:29 - 64:32)
master ball (64:32 - 64:35)
it's just they're just taking your money (64:32 - 64:37)
and giving you a pk hex pokemon (64:35 - 64:40)
that they've duplicated 100 plus times (64:37 - 64:41)
if you get the code (64:40 - 64:44)
for the 15 bucks or 16 or 17 however (64:41 - 64:46)
much they're charging now (64:44 - 64:48)
you enter the code manually in your own (64:46 - 64:49)
nintendo switch it'll show up in your (64:48 - 64:51)
items you'll see it you can (64:49 - 64:53)
it'll it'll be in the history of like (64:51 - 64:54)
all your battle points your (64:53 - 64:58)
your gallerian ponyta you redeemed your (64:54 - 65:00)
um ball guy shirt that you've gotten (64:58 - 65:02)
it'll show up in your history and (65:00 - 65:03)
everything (65:02 - 65:04)
now if you don't want to pay any money (65:03 - 65:06)
for pokemon this is the question i keep (65:04 - 65:07)
getting (65:06 - 65:09)
are we going to get the rude is the rude (65:07 - 65:10)
going to come here (65:09 - 65:12)
is this the only way to get so rude i (65:10 - 65:13)
don't know where you guys have been for (65:12 - 65:15)
the last 20 years (65:13 - 65:18)
every year there is a pokemon movie (65:15 - 65:21)
every year that movie features a (65:18 - 65:23)
mythical pokemon (65:21 - 65:26)
and every year they usually line up (65:23 - 65:27)
together in the u.s (65:26 - 65:29)
so when did we get zera ora the first (65:27 - 65:32)
time when that bad zera aura movie came (65:29 - 65:33)
to theaters although i believe you had (65:32 - 65:36)
to go to gamestop to get the zera aura (65:33 - 65:40)
but it was the same time when did we get (65:36 - 65:42)
hoopa when that bad hoopa movie came to (65:40 - 65:44)
the u.s i actually don't know if that (65:42 - 65:45)
was bad (65:44 - 65:46)
i've been told this bad i haven't seen (65:45 - 65:48)
it when did we get volcanion (65:46 - 65:52)
volcanion when the volcanion movie came (65:48 - 65:54)
this has been this has been ongoing for (65:52 - 65:56)
a long time (65:54 - 65:58)
so when are we going to get so rude when (65:56 - 65:59)
the movie (65:58 - 66:02)
in the u.s gets officially announced i (65:59 - 66:02)
am (66:02 - 66:05)
hedging my bets that it will go straight (66:02 - 66:07)
to netflix because netflix is (66:05 - 66:10)
buying anything they can and putting it (66:07 - 66:12)
on their service for exclusivity (66:10 - 66:15)
and i'm assuming that they will release (66:12 - 66:17)
the rude either at a gamestop (66:15 - 66:19)
a best buy a target or through pokemon (66:17 - 66:20)
home (66:19 - 66:24)
when the movie is ready to come to (66:20 - 66:25)
the united states there is no way (66:24 - 66:26)
they're having people go to a retail (66:25 - 66:29)
location (66:26 - 66:31)
yeah you're probably right i was so some (66:29 - 66:33)
um something magically happens between (66:31 - 66:35)
now and november (66:33 - 66:37)
i don't think there's gonna be any uh i (66:35 - 66:39)
don't know (66:37 - 66:39)
nope there's no magic in the world to (66:40 - 66:43)
solve this problem (66:42 - 66:47)
the there is a a small question of like (66:43 - 66:49)
it's it may be fairly obvious that we'll (66:47 - 66:51)
eventually get zeroed (66:49 - 66:53)
but i think people are worried about us (66:51 - 66:55)
maybe not getting the shiny celebi (66:53 - 66:57)
i don't know it's happened before yeah (66:55 - 66:58)
it has happened before and if you live (66:57 - 67:02)
in australia you don't get any of these (66:58 - 67:02)
i think australia eventually got zero (67:03 - 67:07)
but there was a (67:06 - 67:08)
point in time where they seemed very (67:07 - 67:10)
forgotten about i don't know is (67:08 - 67:13)
is 15 bucks worth it to you guys for (67:10 - 67:14)
these pokemon (67:13 - 67:17)
it's more worth it in a game that i have (67:14 - 67:19)
multiple ways of moving it around (67:17 - 67:22)
so i can get it into home i can get it (67:19 - 67:24)
to other future games (67:22 - 67:27)
i can like that that ecosystem is (67:24 - 67:30)
has me more willing to spend money i i (67:27 - 67:32)
can just be patient (67:30 - 67:35)
it will come someday (67:32 - 67:35)
yeah i don't think they're going to be (67:35 - 67:38)
like you know what that was the rude for (67:36 - 67:40)
you (67:38 - 67:42)
if you do get the zeroed though if (67:40 - 67:43)
you're if you're (67:42 - 67:46)
if you've got money to burn you want to (67:43 - 67:47)
improve the (67:46 - 67:50)
japanic economy by giving money to (67:47 - 67:51)
ebayers (67:50 - 67:54)
um if you take your zarood to the (67:51 - 67:55)
professor (67:54 - 67:56)
in the train station in the isle of (67:55 - 67:59)
armor she will give you an ash hat (67:56 - 68:02)
that you can wear on your trainer which (67:59 - 68:04)
is a little nice bonus (68:02 - 68:06)
this will also work if you don't care (68:04 - 68:09)
about zarood but you care about the hat (68:06 - 68:11)
you can borrow as a rude from your (68:09 - 68:12)
friend (68:11 - 68:15)
oh talk to the lady and then trade the (68:12 - 68:17)
zuru back and then you unlock the hat (68:15 - 68:19)
is this the lady out on the island no (68:17 - 68:21)
it's the one in the train station she's (68:19 - 68:22)
the one that evaluates your pokedex (68:21 - 68:23)
she'll be (68:22 - 68:25)
she'll say something like wow i've this (68:23 - 68:27)
pokemon isn't in the pokedex and then (68:25 - 68:28)
she'll (68:27 - 68:30)
well it does it i mean she's on the (68:28 - 68:31)
island she is (68:30 - 68:33)
on the island just in the train station (68:31 - 68:34)
on the island (68:33 - 68:37)
no chinese route it is shiny locked (68:34 - 68:40)
there is a different zeroed in the game (68:37 - 68:41)
code (68:40 - 68:44)
um i believe bulbapedia calls it dada (68:41 - 68:45)
zarood (68:44 - 68:48)
what uh like daddy but it is the zeroed (68:45 - 68:49)
with the pink (68:48 - 68:53)
celebi cape oh okay which (68:49 - 68:55)
like ash greninja i was gonna say more (68:53 - 68:57)
like az's floette (68:55 - 69:01)
yeah okay yeah yeah the thing that never (68:57 - 69:02)
appeared you think that they would have (69:01 - 69:05)
distributed that one (69:02 - 69:07)
because that one that's coming in 2021 (69:05 - 69:10)
that one is more for the movie (69:07 - 69:12)
that is not available in the game either (69:10 - 69:14)
jeez no pokemon masters news (69:12 - 69:16)
nothing nothing's happening nothing (69:14 - 69:18)
nothing is happening i'm shocked (69:16 - 69:21)
i think terrible (69:18 - 69:21)
i i think this is the calm before the (69:22 - 69:27)
one year anniversary storm (69:25 - 69:31)
yeah question of the week greg yes sbj (69:27 - 69:32)
please (69:31 - 69:36)
don't blame me for what you see i just (69:32 - 69:40)
ask for the questions of the week (69:36 - 69:44)
sbj please you know (69:40 - 69:48)
what i seek please ask us the questions (69:44 - 69:51)
of the week (69:48 - 69:53)
and there's a lot of just three good (69:51 - 69:54)
questions this week (69:53 - 69:56)
yeah there were shout outs shout out to (69:54 - 69:57)
slack (69:56 - 69:59)
yeah that's a toughy so i don't know (69:57 - 70:00)
what you're gonna pick because i like (69:59 - 70:01)
them all (70:00 - 70:02)
maybe i'll just maybe we'll just save (70:01 - 70:04)
these three questions for the next three (70:02 - 70:06)
episodes (70:04 - 70:06)
i guess i'll go with brandon has there (70:06 - 70:09)
ever been a pokemon (70:08 - 70:12)
that despite its popularity what it (70:09 - 70:14)
stands for or the culture (70:12 - 70:18)
created that you wish never existed what (70:14 - 70:20)
i'm gonna wish it away into the nowhere (70:18 - 70:21)
place (70:20 - 70:24)
i mean i don't i don't care about the (70:21 - 70:25)
charizard popularity (70:24 - 70:27)
i don't really either and it's never (70:25 - 70:30)
really bothered me it's just like (70:27 - 70:32)
i don't know like doesn't for like like (70:30 - 70:33)
literally every star wars fan (70:32 - 70:37)
like loves r2d2 and cp well r2d2 (70:33 - 70:40)
let's not go that far right like every (70:37 - 70:42)
star wars fan loves (70:40 - 70:45)
bb-8 yeah because bb-8 is great so it's (70:42 - 70:46)
like charizard is just (70:45 - 70:49)
that just at a in the pokemon world like (70:46 - 70:51)
people just like it (70:49 - 70:53)
you despise because of its popularity (70:51 - 70:54)
what it stands for (70:53 - 70:56)
or the culture it created that you wish (70:54 - 70:58)
never existed gee (70:56 - 71:02)
maybe jinx yeah (70:58 - 71:05)
it's like it's it's not and it doesn't (71:02 - 71:07)
respond to any of those three prompts (71:05 - 71:10)
well i will say this i do think (71:07 - 71:13)
i do sort of wish jinx didn't exist (71:10 - 71:15)
based off of the culture that it stands (71:13 - 71:17)
for because (71:15 - 71:20)
people use it for very (71:17 - 71:22)
it's already on the edge and then people (71:20 - 71:23)
use it as (71:22 - 71:27)
either like a super (71:23 - 71:30)
poor suggestive joke which is like (71:27 - 71:34)
don't don't lean into it or use it as (71:30 - 71:38)
a criticism of the existing franchise (71:34 - 71:38)
well like (71:38 - 71:43)
look what they did here 25 years ago (71:38 - 71:46)
um so i think definitely created the (71:43 - 71:46)
culture (71:46 - 71:49)
it definitely created a culture of (71:46 - 71:52)
negativity on both sides that i don't (71:49 - 71:55)
particularly care for and if if (71:52 - 71:58)
that went away and we just had smoocham (71:55 - 72:00)
i would be happy (71:58 - 72:02)
or if we got an evolution and we could (72:00 - 72:04)
just get past it (72:02 - 72:06)
or something yeah i think jinx is (72:04 - 72:07)
probably (72:06 - 72:09)
the one that affects culture the most or (72:07 - 72:10)
they just keep (72:09 - 72:14)
changing it slightly yeah yeah (72:10 - 72:18)
so yeah i i so i have an answer (72:14 - 72:20)
okay you ready yep and it's like i don't (72:18 - 72:21)
i don't have anything against the (72:20 - 72:24)
pokemon i think it's an ugly pokemon (72:21 - 72:25)
not definitely not one of my favorites (72:24 - 72:27)
but it still has a right to exist i'm (72:25 - 72:28)
sure (72:27 - 72:30)
somebody out there is a huge fan but all (72:28 - 72:32)
the diggers be memes (72:30 - 72:34)
that were just like so pointless it (72:32 - 72:35)
diggers me though (72:34 - 72:39)
it just like wasted like that fraction (72:35 - 72:40)
of my brain power and then it kept (72:39 - 72:42)
coming up over and over and over again (72:40 - 72:44)
that it became more than a fraction of (72:42 - 72:45)
my brainpower (72:44 - 72:47)
that i resent that so i resent the (72:45 - 72:48)
diggers be memes (72:47 - 72:51)
i don't diggers be on its own is (72:48 - 72:54)
weird hand ears that's fine diggersby (72:51 - 72:57)
prior to that meme was a was probably (72:54 - 72:59)
one of the most shocking evolutions i've (72:57 - 73:00)
ever seen (72:59 - 73:04)
like like not knowing what bundle b was (73:00 - 73:06)
going to evolve into (73:04 - 73:07)
and then seeing it evolve into that i (73:06 - 73:10)
was like whoa (73:07 - 73:13)
what happened (73:10 - 73:15)
i don't i don't think there's ever been (73:13 - 73:16)
a pokemon that i've hated because of its (73:15 - 73:17)
popularity (73:16 - 73:20)
like i don't get why lucario is popular (73:17 - 73:22)
other than people (73:20 - 73:25)
like buy into the marketing um (73:22 - 73:27)
well i mean because right that that just (73:25 - 73:29)
the premise behind that question (73:27 - 73:31)
is like hipster mentality of oh (73:29 - 73:32)
everybody likes this (73:31 - 73:35)
so i can't like this yeah well you know (73:32 - 73:37)
what that new taylor swift album (73:35 - 73:40)
straight fire will anderson loves it so (73:37 - 73:42)
don't be hating on taylor swift i'm not (73:40 - 73:44)
a swifty will (73:42 - 73:46)
pokemon of the week oh boy you guys (73:44 - 73:47)
ain't ready for this (73:46 - 73:49)
but last week's pokemon of the week blah (73:47 - 73:51)
blah blah something about will anderson (73:49 - 73:53)
playing classical guitar why does he (73:51 - 73:54)
bother us with his personal life has (73:53 - 73:56)
nothing to do with pokemon of the week (73:54 - 73:56)
or so you (73:56 - 74:00)
think music in the gen 5 black and white (73:56 - 74:03)
games you had to do perform certain (74:00 - 74:03)
tasks (74:03 - 74:05)
unlock portions of the sound track one (74:03 - 74:08)
of those tasks you had to show (74:05 - 74:11)
a pokemon to the piano player in a (74:08 - 74:13)
cubiela town in the upper right hand (74:11 - 74:13)
corner (74:13 - 74:16)
but strangely enough that pokemon was (74:13 - 74:17)
not available (74:16 - 74:20)
in black and white too so you had to go (74:17 - 74:22)
through all kinds of mechanisms to breed (74:20 - 74:22)
it (74:22 - 74:25)
or to trade it in to get it into the (74:22 - 74:26)
game so you could show it to that person (74:25 - 74:28)
so you could unlock the piano track for (74:26 - 74:30)
a cumulation (74:28 - 74:34)
i mean and i also use the word tater (74:30 - 74:34)
i think i have it right who was the (74:38 - 74:42)
pokemon last week (74:40 - 74:46)
it's lucario (74:42 - 74:49)
no cricket cricket hot (74:46 - 74:52)
correct yeah it's got a good shiny i (74:49 - 74:54)
like i do like the orangey shirt (74:52 - 74:56)
uh it's a little too subtle for me oh (74:54 - 74:57)
really (74:56 - 75:00)
i think yeah i prefer uh like a (74:57 - 75:03)
a more like this is good i prefer to (75:00 - 75:07)
to avoid the joltik issue um and to have (75:03 - 75:12)
a very distinctive (75:07 - 75:12)
did you just say joltik has a distinct (75:14 - 75:17)
shiny yeah his eyes are a whole (75:16 - 75:18)
different color (75:17 - 75:22)
dude i literally read (75:18 - 75:25)
extra shiny joel ticks because i didn't (75:22 - 75:27)
realize that i had gotten the shiny (75:25 - 75:30)
you should have looked into its eyes (75:27 - 75:30)
okay it's like six star in science his (75:31 - 75:35)
eyes are pretty different (75:33 - 75:37)
that's it that's literally the biggest (75:35 - 75:38)
difference right there (75:37 - 75:39)
is the color of the eyes yeah you just (75:38 - 75:41)
gotta look at the eyes they're not that (75:39 - 75:42)
different what (75:41 - 75:45)
one is like blue and the other is purple (75:42 - 75:49)
blue and purple yes (75:45 - 75:51)
colors you know the color that comes (75:49 - 75:52)
right after blue (75:51 - 75:56)
purple oh my goodness it's like (75:52 - 75:59)
like if you said it's blue and red (75:56 - 76:03)
okay there blue and purple yep (75:59 - 76:07)
darker blue i would say (76:03 - 76:09)
he's pretty noticeable could i get some (76:07 - 76:10)
tater tot (76:09 - 76:12)
uh trivia facts please yeah it's got at (76:10 - 76:13)
least (76:12 - 76:15)
the only pokemon with the base that (76:13 - 76:18)
total of 194 (76:15 - 76:21)
true to its pokedex entry krikitat's cry (76:18 - 76:23)
sounds like (76:21 - 76:26)
uh that of a xylophone cricket (76:23 - 76:29)
evolves at the lowest level of a pokemon (76:26 - 76:30)
that are part of a (76:29 - 76:33)
two-stage evolutionary line being at (76:30 - 76:34)
level 10. (76:33 - 76:37)
interesting there who evolves lower than (76:34 - 76:38)
level 10 (76:37 - 76:40)
out of all pokemon well there's some (76:38 - 76:42)
pokemon you could level you could (76:40 - 76:43)
you could develop a level one that's (76:42 - 76:46)
true because category evolves at seven (76:43 - 76:48)
well but there's ones that also do item (76:46 - 76:49)
leveling so (76:48 - 76:51)
you can just automatically you can (76:49 - 76:52)
evolve them yeah (76:51 - 76:54)
you can breed a rosalia and then (76:52 - 76:58)
immediately evolve it yeah at level one (76:54 - 77:00)
which just seems a little why are we (76:58 - 77:02)
forcing our children to grow up so fast (77:00 - 77:04)
because they need to get into the battle (77:02 - 77:05)
and fight (77:04 - 77:08)
well uh for those who don't know because (77:05 - 77:10)
maybe you don't pay as much attention to (77:08 - 77:11)
pokemon as other people (77:10 - 77:14)
uh pre-evolutions learn moves faster (77:11 - 77:17)
than evolved pokemon so keep that in (77:14 - 77:18)
mind (77:17 - 77:20)
but what if i brought all the moves on (77:18 - 77:21)
it that i want oh (77:20 - 77:25)
who how can you breed four egg moves (77:21 - 77:27)
oh you'd be surprised oh geez i'm a (77:25 - 77:29)
master breeder (77:27 - 77:32)
how's that shuffle icon for cricket (77:29 - 77:32)
tottenham (77:32 - 77:35)
it's pretty good it's cute green dot's a (77:32 - 77:36)
really cute pokemon (77:35 - 77:38)
yeah it's a little tight a little tater (77:36 - 77:40)
tot the tater tot with a collar (77:38 - 77:42)
don't put it in your hot dish though (77:40 - 77:44)
because it is a bug it's got a xylophone (77:42 - 77:47)
chest all right this week's pokemon (77:44 - 77:48)
we're going easy (77:47 - 77:50)
on folks because i've been a little (77:48 - 77:51)
difficult lately we got a review that (77:50 - 77:53)
said you were too easy (77:51 - 77:57)
oh what i didn't see that review (77:53 - 77:59)
said make pokemon of the week harder oh (77:57 - 78:01)
i'll make it real harder it'll be one (77:59 - 78:01)
letter (78:01 - 78:04)
i'll give you one letter next week folks (78:01 - 78:04)
get (78:04 - 78:06)
start start start your brain power in (78:04 - 78:07)
advance because i'm giving you one (78:06 - 78:09)
letter and you gotta pick up pokemon (78:07 - 78:11)
can we play name that pokemon i can name (78:09 - 78:14)
that pokemon in 15 letters (78:11 - 78:18)
and it's not any of the unknowns um (78:14 - 78:21)
here we go when perusing the sinnoh (78:18 - 78:22)
pokedex (78:21 - 78:24)
you need to venture quite far down the (78:22 - 78:27)
list before you encounter any ice type (78:24 - 78:28)
pokemon (78:27 - 78:30)
even though sinnoh is definitely of a (78:28 - 78:31)
northern climate (78:30 - 78:33)
the first few pokemon that include ice (78:31 - 78:36)
type are not primarily ice type (78:33 - 78:38)
the first one that is primarily ice type (78:36 - 78:40)
is a mono ice type (78:38 - 78:43)
and then we have this week's pokemon (78:40 - 78:44)
which is the first (78:43 - 78:47)
dual type pokemon in sinnoh that is ice (78:44 - 78:48)
type (78:47 - 78:51)
first before its second typing (78:48 - 78:52)
of additional intrigue is that this (78:51 - 78:55)
pokemon cannot be caught in the wild in (78:52 - 78:56)
diamond (78:55 - 78:59)
pearl platinum heart gold or soul silver (78:56 - 79:02)
startling as this pokemon was first (78:59 - 79:03)
introduced in the fourth generation (79:02 - 79:04)
games (79:03 - 79:07)
in fact the only games where this (79:04 - 79:09)
pokemon can be caught in the wild (79:07 - 79:11)
are black and white and black and white (79:09 - 79:14)
too this pokemon can only be obtained in (79:11 - 79:15)
other games (79:14 - 79:17)
by meeting the special evolution (79:15 - 79:19)
conditions placed upon its predecessor (79:17 - 79:22)
evolution conditions similar to those (79:19 - 79:24)
that exist for tangela (79:22 - 79:26)
in one of those life imitates pokemon (79:24 - 79:27)
moments (79:26 - 79:30)
in 2019 scientists attempted to jurassic (79:27 - 79:32)
park some dna from a mummy (79:30 - 79:34)
that was found in the siberian (79:32 - 79:36)
permafrost in 2011. (79:34 - 79:38)
you can read all about it in the march (79:36 - 79:40)
14 2019 (79:38 - 79:43)
article in the web magazine live science (79:40 - 79:45)
they were not successful but (79:43 - 79:48)
if they had been we may have seen the (79:45 - 79:49)
animal this pokemon was based on (79:48 - 79:52)
walking in the real world again not a (79:49 - 79:54)
dinosaur (79:52 - 79:56)
okay that is your pokemon of the week i (79:54 - 79:57)
made it super easy (79:56 - 79:59)
for all the folks who found it too hard (79:57 - 80:01)
lately if you're finding it too easy (79:59 - 80:04)
you're lying because sometimes i put in (80:01 - 80:06)
false things (80:04 - 80:06)
that's not true that's not true i do (80:07 - 80:11)
play classical guitar (80:09 - 80:14)
