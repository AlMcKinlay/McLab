what's up everyone welcome to the 421st episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective now 10 years running well 10 years in one week yeah we got big news hold on i'm sbj i'm your host greg here hello just to let you know there may be a slight delay uh when will answers because i was just awarded a master's doctorate in lawyering so we have a separate stream up to consult whether he should answer these questions during your ongoing litigation correct oh am i allowed to say that yes wait a minute masters masters of lawyering i have a steve give me my intro will is also here i have a pokemon related bone to pick with mr greg leatherman what okay what could you i am trying to date here in minneapolis and for those of you out there who aren't dating in minneapolis or any other place a lot of these dating apps nowadays they link to your instagram right you've seen that you go to a dude's profile on you you're like oh well let me look at the instagram photos to see what they're really like how come every time i pull up a guy that i'm interested in dating and go to his instagram it's like every photo liked by greg leatherman do you know everybody in this city look i am your frontline interviewer i am there i sort through people if i've liked their instagram generally they're a decent person or they're cute mostly they're a decent person chances are that i've met them for sure well i mean the dude that canceled me this on me this morning wasn't a decent person well who was it send it to me in text this is not the big news we were starting off with i will oh what's the big news what's the big news although greg knowing everyone in minnesota is not surprising true no two things before we get to the big news number one is uh look i don't what would you want from me um number one i want you to keep your promises number one is there is a shiny amungus distribution happening right now by the time alert yes yeah yeah by the expires tomorrow yeah it expires tomorrow did you get it yeah i totally got it this morning i gotta remember to do that when we're done recording fires at like 8 a.m uh california time 11 a.m eastern time so if you listen to this right when it drops and you're in north america you should be able to redeem it on august 10th otherwise i think it's like 5 p.m uh uk time and then it's like midnight japan time look it's based off utc or not utc no it's not based off utc i'm sorry it's based off of uh midnight in korea which i think lines up with midnight in which is like an hour off from japan something like that that amungus is available it is the amungus that won the seniors cup division i don't have these notes in front of me seniors cup in last year i believe so this would make sense because the players cup is going on right now also this upcoming weekend was supposed to be the world championships so them giving a pokemon from the last world's championships makes sense although here we are that didn't happen the other thing that didn't happen that will be ending probably by the time this podcast goes up is that every august there is an event in japan called pikachu outbreak and that also didn't happen do both events didn't happen due to covet but they made pichu pikachu raichu and alolan raichu and a one percent chance for mimikyu spawning in raids from thursday to sunday and in five star raids there was an eight percent chance for pikachu to be shiny uh which is better than the waylord event which was a two percent chance very similar to the magikarp event which was also eight percent the difference is pikachu could only be shiny in five star raids i believe magikarp could be shiny in any star raid uh that being said that was to celebrate the pikachu uh likely to celebrate pikachu outbreak i don't think they came and said that i'm pretty sure exactly one week ago on the show we said there's probably gonna be another event right because probably the raids this month are very lackluster and they did it they they they announced it on uh the twitter and didn't one place announce it wrong oh we'll get to that the website okay and um instead of doing just saturday and sunday they did thursday friday saturday sunday which i think is a way better way to do that although again i don't uh um the pokemon why is everything the same weekend we're gonna do don't even get me oh my gosh we're gonna do community day we're gonna do pikachu we're gonna do the players cup we're gonna there's nothing pokemon masters this weekend think thank goodness well then see what are you complaining about there's too much i so i will say that i almost skipped community today and the only reason why i actually i only did it because i was actually meeting a friend to go hang out outside six feet apart uh because we haven't seen each other in a year uh so while we're sitting six feet apart i just had my phone open and was not moving just tossing to get magikarp uh otherwise i was gonna skip it because i'm kind of burnt out on the whole community today thing uh because there's too much going on but they do like to overlap and it's frustrating because i want to play i want to get my surfing alolan raichu and maybe a shiny pikachu i want to do all those things but you can't do everything well you can if you just if pokemon is number one in your life it's not i guess family is number two my dog ate a squirrel what are you a whole squirrel we're not sure how much the squirrel goblin swallowed hole well that's our show for you guys today we just know it happened let's actually get into the news here so we'll start with the what greg brought up the japanese twitter slash website slash the little in news notification on the switch that no one ever checks why would you yeah well i mean it shows up kind of when you like open your switch but i don't think anyone's looking at the screen i think they're just tapping a as fast as possible as fast as possible i have to hit it three times to get in to play my game for no reason they they said that the event that hey there's a pikachu event if you're lucky trainers you may get a shiny pikachu there was a data miner i can't remember their name i made a i made a graphic about it but the data miner posted that only pikachu was affected for this event the five star pikachu we mentioned earlier but all of the switch the japanese twitter they said that it went until august 9th if you were playing the po if you were playing and you saw this on thursday evening because obviously japan is in the future so you know our 7 p.m central time in japan in america is like noon or something in japan so they posted their update they posted their information and then you know we have to wait until the next morning we'll have to wait till friday morning because no one's working in america well no one with an office job is work well maybe some people are uh working with an office job at like 7pm so you have to wait till they get in the office in over in seattle and then they post the information and they posted on their website pokemon.com discover pikachu raichu pichu and max ray battles start searching for those pokemon dems the pikachu mass appearance event ends runs through august 16th so we have the nintendo switch we have the japanese twitter saying august 9th and we have pokemon.com an official source of news saying august 16th then like 5 p.m on friday the play pokemon twitter and then also an official twitter so the the website article went up at like what 10 a.m 11 a.m because when i posted i already made my graphic based off the japanese twitter i posted my graphic and then i was like oh pokemon.com published the article let me just make sure everything's good and then they they said august 16th and i was like well sarah b and everyone else is saying august 9th the official pokemon website is saying august 16th i don't know who to believe you would think that out of everything you can post the a date is like pretty universal right like i know in like britain they put like the the day before the month it's like everywhere else in the world don't just blame that on britain it's more like you know in the u.s they put the month before the day yeah and that's the only place where we do that but to add a whole extra week so the website goes the 16th then several hours later play pokemon says where there's a pikachu event running till the 9th who posted this article no no no no the prob the problem is the the website was using metric time yeah and it was just as a fluke and then everybody else was using regular time right the next day i believe saturday morning because they posted originally on the website on friday and then on saturday morning i rechecked it says start searching for those pokemon dens the pikachu mass appearance event goes to august 9th correction an early version of the article incorrectly the state of the end date for the 16th we apologize for the error so they did correct it they did update it i noticed although this wasn't probably that big of a deal like two months ago when there was a road time event do you remember when they put like competitive pokemon in raids it was like rotom draggapult excadrill yes it was the greatest day of my life they the website said like oh you get heat rotom and this and you get washed in that they actually flipped it and every time the this is the second time at least in the last couple months i remember pokemon.com having an issue and i tweeted at them and i that time with the road time and i cc'd one of the people i know that work with communication at pokemon and magically the website just said instead of saying like wash rotom and shield and heat rotom and sword it randomly said you'll find rotoms in both games i'm not saying that my tweets specifically did that i'm just saying that they they there was an error and they corrected it although they didn't have an a correction like they do with this one was maybe maybe there was the only thing i can think of there was discussion of making this event longer and then they said no we can't make it longer because there's another event coming yeah we can't make it longer because steve keeps complaining that there's too many things going on so we gotta cut everything short so there's no overlap correct thanks steve well i'm assuming there would be another event supposed to be coming will what because this weekend steve i'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt of why there was an error here never give a company the benefit of the doubt tear it down and start new quest now frauds if you can't get your timeline straight why should we believe you about anything glory to america yeah heck yeah heck yeah wait no this weekend is supposed to be the world champ was supposed to be the world championship in the uk we were all supposed to be there greg me will all supposed to be sipping our tea and feed on the table with the crumpets and then drinkers al was there in in his kilts playing a bagpipe yep was all the haggis nothing but haggis do you think steve would actually eat haggis heck no if you didn't tell him what it was it just probably looks like a tasty bread thing yeah i think if haggis like sauerkraut is that the same no no because sauerkraut is disgusting what what what are you not german sauerkraut look i can put my 23andme sauerkraut is delicious probably the worst thing i've ever tasted oh i got worse for you buddy stinky tofu heck yeah have you tried lunafisk we can go down the rabbit hole real quick are we hedging bets on there's an event this weekend in sword and shield there's got to be something for fake worlds right why would they just cancel the digital event just roll with it yeah yeah i think you're right they're going to release new gallerian forms all right let's uh get carried away here what okay so given the fact that they'll just shove something in max raid dens what is the most likely thing to go into max ray den's four worlds ooh shiny togekiss uh you know i bet um i was gonna say maybe they put the score bunny grookie sabble in max droid dens oh with hidden ability yeah potential yeah oh i could see that because well but they want they want people to subscribe well i guess it doesn't matter i was going to say originally they distributed this to at home but at this point they're bred and fed everywhere like at this point the the those rabbits have gotten out of the cage multiplied in two more multiplied into many many things although surprisingly it's it surprises me how often really boom is showing up now because of that grassy grassy grassy grassy glide to anyone that said incineroar was the worst thing in sun and moon competitively really boom is 10 times worse hey is it as bad as ally switch look ally switches is the worst i'm not saying gorillapod is the worst but ally switch is definitely the worst thing what is ally switch is that where you can just swap sides yeah yeah so you go to like max rockfall of cinderease and then the dust clops ally switch so the max rock followed the dust collapse and then number one two damage the pokemon's name is cinderache yes my music i really wish you would get it right we've been telling you this for a while number two get good scrub noob ah speaking of competitive episode seven of pokemon twilight wings is available it is it's a thing that series what happened uh i have not seen it yet so i can't comment have you seen any of it yeah i've been doing every okay patreon i you know i pay for the patreon and for some reason i don't see those so i did something wrong so greg it sounds like you didn't like the series it was just boring like they were slightly interesting slices of life but little more than that does that people want an anime they want that slice of life anime isn't a huge market it would have been better if they were longer so you could see more story develop otherwise it was just like a seven minute problem that was solved in seven minutes and usually it was a very surface level problem that was easily solved i mean they're they're cute but otherwise it's not like i i don't have the same feeling to show them as it did for origins i thought origins was really well i thought generations was really well like they took they took parts of the game and expanded it and here they just took people and gave them really slight stories and they're interesting and it was well animated but otherwise it was just like okay i have no desire to go watch any of these again yeah i can see they're pretty forgettable yeah i feel like i would put on origins again yeah i would put on origins again and i have multiple times some more news off pokemon.com encounter unknown dioxis lgm and more during pokemon goes enigma week and then just a reminder that if you have if you did purchase a gofest ticket you will have that uh upcoming event on the 15th yes uh which is from 11 to 2 your time and then it will be the fire hour water hour and then friendship hour uh where you can play anywhere and you get two free remote raid passes i think and two free incense with that so those are only two people who bought tickets to go fest but this week you'll be able to see clefairy jigglypuff start you lunatone soul rock ball toy bronze or an lgm frequently appearing in the wild if you're hatching eggs clefa igly buff lunatone soul rock lgm are hatching out of 7k egg star u now has the possibility of being shiny raid battles will feature claytol bronzong lgm uh you'll also have a rare opportunity to battle unknown u l t r and a in raid battles uh these you should be able to do yourself you probably don't need a group i mean it's unknown they got one move kind of good stats and then the mythical pokemon deoxis will appear in its normal form in five star raids and if you're lucky as always trainers you may encounter a shiny deoxys i haven't yet me either uh this will go till friday august 14th until 1pm pdt i mean i mean that's it uh then the following week will be the unova week which will have um bouvelant in new york uh so waddle or sea waddle i'm not sure how to say that one yet so waddle uh because it sews yes exactly i think i put too much evidence of f emphasis on the sew part so it doesn't sound natural you put the emphasis on the wrong syllable and then genesect will be appearing next week in raid battles and it will be a chance for shiny which is very good for non-japanese players since genesis was only distributed in japan as a shiny how was your guys's magikarp will didn't do it well i intended to i tried i tried and will had an entire conversation without me i mean i had an entire conversation with myself that i imagined you were aware of look kids this coronavirus is real bad we've been locked in our house for a while um i didn't i didn't buy the ticket i didn't pay the dollar thing to do i just didn't want to invest that much into it i met a friend who hadn't seen in a while so i just sat in a park with them so that we could safely uh socialize and while we were socializing for two hours i did magikarp day i got like i got a surprising amount of shinies i think i got eight in the two hours that i did it it was fine i didn't do all the things i was just like i felt the burnout like i've done so many community days it feels like it's been every other weekend where it was like go fest and community day and then community day and i was just like i'm tired i don't care about magikarp i don't care about how good the gyarados would be in the part i like the lease which is gym battles and pvp so it i just did it half heartedly and it was fine like there was good spawns it was a good spawn rate i got i think it ended with 900 uh magikarp candies that i used to evolve to two carps and i called it today yeah i think the thing for me was number one for me community day is primarily just an excuse to go and see greg yes but then like number two it was magikarp i already have shiny magikarp yeah i mean i like so many in other games too i know it's just like it it literally it was like it's not worth getting out of bed for four magikarp i had a different goal while everyone wanted as many shinies as possible i wanted to get the catch 300 big magikarp medal in pokemon i got 50. you don't have that already no i i started the day i think with a hundred and nineteen big magikarp 120 big magikarp maybe i'm not in a water biome so like i barely see water pokemon unless i i'm like i'm in a water biome are you i don't know i didn't was dc in a water biome i used there used to be a fountain by my house in dc so when i would walk my dog uh there was always a magikarp there so it's like i literally got a magikarp a day if not multiple magikarps a day so yeah i never ever see magic carp unless i go to like the like front which is 10 000 lakes we have two big rivers we see magikarp plenty here yeah i don't see a lot of magikarp i think i like i i ended the day with 160 out of 300 big magikarp so i guess in this five hours i played i only got 40 big magikarp so that's a bit of a bummer only 140 more to go to get that fisherman vest do you already have the boots and everything no because i'm not going to buy the outfit until i get the whole outfit the fest is five dollars on its own it's a weird thing in games yes this is what this is what i love is you have to earn the right to spend your money yeah that's so weird that was a thing of destiny too i don't know if you remember that will it was like you had to do the the whole year event of like do all these things before the to celebrate one year of destiny and then if you do it you get to spend 20 on a shirt i mean i'm going to tell you this next weekend i will do very little pokemon because the new patch for final fantasy 14 hits on tuesday it's a huge patch i'm very excited so don't i like if you all of you're like you haven't opened my gifts like there's gonna be a couple of weeks kids what are they gonna fix a realm reborn it's still a slog this patch starts oh it's so you can now fly in romer born after you completed it so flight comes uh they are way upping the quest rewards and they're cutting out a bunch of uh the first run through of cutting quests happens in this patch and then they promise a bigger chunk i think the next big chunk is in 5'4 but um they fixed a lot of it because starting tuesday if you play for free you can now go from level 1 to 60 instead of 1 to 30. so you can get all the way through rumor born and all the way through heaven's word and access the three big classes all for free so that starts tuesday if you've ever been interested you can play a lot it's a much streamlined game and heavensward is a really good expansion join on in come to gilgamesh that's where oh i am don't listen to steve he picks terrible sir gilgamesh is overpopulated though isn't it nah nothing's ever populated right now are you guys going to try for shiny deoxys the thing is is it costs a lot of money to do remote raids and i don't i i don't want to travel a lot to get them and like then try to find five people who are on at the same time and coordinated it's been pretty easy in the slack to coordinate five people usually i just post like hey i got a deoxys in five minutes who's wants to do it yeah that requires me to be on my phone and in slack waiting yeah available right my problem is like you guys literally like you guys were doing remote raids last night right yeah i think uh greg and i did like two together yeah when i was literally at the skate park like with all my pads and everything which trust me when will's got his skate pads on there's no room for pokemon go that's like i'm you might as well just like wrapped me in bubble wrap when i when i have my skate pads on and i'm like well i can't do this now i'd love to join but it's not a possibility can we like can i get like a 12-hour warning of like this is what i'm going to be looking for the axis raids will so don't go to the skate park even though it's like perfect weather for skating tonight if we want to set aside tuesday evening when i record no well wednesday is when the actual raid hour is yeah but i got a game to run on wednesday see that we live too much this is the problem we have too many lives for raids okay so even even if if deoxys at this point isn't this is this is the dilemma it's not my destiny deoxys is not my destiny there you go okay so like let's let's just say this was shiny me too right you got plenty of ways to hunt shiny me too ultra sun ultra moon software setting let's go pikachu let's go eevee software setting fire red leaf green software setting you have multiple games um so ultimately if you own those games the cost of getting them you two is free minus your time in pokemon go i have now spent over 30 dollars on raid passes specifically to get shiny deoxys because i do want shiny dioxis i want it it's for me it is very difficult to be motivated motivated to do anything in pokemon go because it is still not linked to pokemon home and it's like if i could get a shiny and poke shiny dioxis in pokemon go that i could then transfer into my pokemon home and have it as part of my collection i'd be heck yeah i'd be like i'd be calling you guys every day let's do that right let's that what's his name that's the goal right like i'm going to get the chinese before the week and then i'm going to wait and then i'm going to transfer it well but i i i live in the moment i live for today not for tomorrow i but i would like literally like i'd be hitting up that what is his name jake in in liverpool uh i'd be like dude yeah i'll do these remote raids for you in the middle of the night or in the middle of my work day but no i i i have no call for it because they don't even have a timeline of like that's true within the next six months i it's frustrating and i get that it's luck like i'm at like 30 60 accesses four of those were like free because the raid passes the daily raid passes and then what is a remote raid it's like two dollars and fifty cents for three of them and then if you buy uh the gift box or whatever you get like it's like 16 and you get like 18 passes or so it's like about 30 i've spent on raid passes and besides the fact that like i genuinely like pokemon go and i'm doing this with other people and i'm able to do with people in slack or discord or watching the twitch streams and that's fun i still can't help but think that at this point now the access has cost me half of a copy of sword and shield yeah it's a lot of money uh but also there's like a i'm gonna save that money for gardenscapes a game with real values yeah i can't even finish that but also i think there is like a time value of is it worth your time like for for shiny articuno in let's go pikachu let's go eevee that took over a hundred hours for me yeah but that was also a hundred hours of what you do for a living well yeah but i'm i'm trying to put my my feet into the shoes of normal people like yeah for me that's a hundred hours of hanging out with twitch chat and talking with them and it is what i do for a living but there are people who don't stream who just like to get shiny pokemon and they could be on their couch software setting for a hundred plus hours and that is also frustrating i don't know what's more but they're also not just doing that right like i've never just sat and software said it in complete silence for a hundred hours i've watched movies but you don't i've listened no i imagine all people suffer setting climb into the closet with the lights off close the door and just you know mother i need to be in my software set room close the door and slide food under for me please i mean they're doing things like software setting does not take all of your attention just like i mean i you know i'm a pseudo method almost every shiny that i have and that is me watching a movie while going around in a circle and looking down every minute and saying uh nope put it in the box there's a lot of other things the difference about pokemon go is i have to either travel somewhere or i have to wait for somebody to say okay we're gonna go do it in 20 minutes okay invites are coming out get into the invites i'm paying x amount of money to do this and then i'm playing a very poor tapping game the worst type of cookie clicker and then for a chance and it eats up a lot of time and since they're around the world i either have to sit in slack or wait for people to message me on twitter or send me a text message and hope that i'm near my phone and then log in and it is a process that doesn't exist in the real games and i find that process sometimes very frustrating like i can't soft reset that raid i get one chance and then it's i drive to the next one or i wait for somebody else to drive to the next one like there's a huge time investment where pokemon go eats up all of your attention to be able to get a chance to do this one thing and you are not only paying for it in time but you're paying for an actual cash i find it's really frustrating i find that thing frustrating it's like a long time ago like same with rayquaza i was like look if i get it i get it if i don't i don't i'll take the chances that i have but i'm not i'm not invested into having this on my phone and also it can't move anywhere right now so the only person that cares about having it is me and posting it on twitter for the four minutes that people will look at it and move on with their lives well absolutely the only time doing these kinds of raids is like real touch your heart fun and pleasure is like after pokemon go fest and it's a day and they're just like have raid after raid after raid of something really good and fun and you're like running around chicago with your buddies doing doing raids right that is a great time when it's just like the middle of the year and you're on your own in south minneapolis crying because you can't leave your house yeah that's no fun no it's not even worth a buck let alone five i'm good i'm in too deep now well you're you you are you have always been in too deep but you also have like you also have a captive audience that will show up for your remote rates yeah i guess yeah you you are you are you are right i am at a slight advantage where when i because i decided to live stream community so thank you to everyone that came out my my irl pokemon go live streams are i think i would rather work mcdonald's drive through it is i love doing them spoiler alert you can i i love doing them but they are it is the hardest thing i think i've ever done in life is to walk around in heat with a 10-pound backpack with the possibility and the guarantee that there will be technical issues every 15 minutes and it is something it cannot be a twitch thing it just must be the general point of the game because the game is free and so there's such a low barrier of entry of like all these kids having access to a phone and then having access to a free game but the um the the audi and i i hate when people are like pokemon's a kids game look i play sword and shield 40 plus hours a week in front of people and yeah totally their kids love pokemon so yeah so do adults and the people who come through my come through my streams are for the most part very polite uh they provide good conversation they argue with me about how my opinions are wrong which is is is fair um they're they're they're humans when i stream pokemon go i do not get humans i get i get a what i assume to be an 11 year old that has no clue how the world works they don't know how to say hi they don't know how to say hello they don't know how to ask a question they just go this is a pokemon go stream friend code friend code for like they're just spamming their friend code uh and now we have bots set up we got to the point in my twitch stream where we have bots to detect a pokemon go friend code to then delete the friend code and then to warn the person being like hey don't share your friend codes here that's not what we're going for but they try again and then it's just people coming in being like hey i need to get into a raid i need to get into a raid look dude you're new here i'm i'm fairly competent at recognizing people's names you're not following the stream you're new here fairly competent fairly kind this is your first time here you didn't say hello the first thing you want is like i need a deoxis there's 200 plus people here i can only send five invites my friends list is full i have a bunch of subscribers that have been asking to get on my friends list for over a year they're just so and again this just doesn't happen with sword and shield it doesn't happen with let's go it doesn't happen with heart gold soul silver it's specifically pokemon go where people come in and they're like well i need the access right away front 80 degrees i am my phone is slipping on my hand because i'm sweating two things here number one will anderson laugh at what you people call hot okay y'all i'm so sad for you please don't ever try to live in dc for the summer because you'll just die two there are so many more pokemon go players than any other type of pokemon game that's true that is why the audience is so drastically different because it just attracts just so many people that you're gonna get well and of course it's that venn diagram of pokemon go player and somebody who would watch somebody play pokemon go on twitch all right there's a level of desperation there that's built into the equation think about the logic of this you are playing a game where it's raids so you are intended to be outside walking around going to those raids but somehow your viewer is watching twitch so they're not outside walking around doing those raids what what is the the mind the brain that creates that situation that is your viewer there it works in this instance just because they did make it so easy to play at home right like if i was trying to do magikarp community day but it was last august i can't imagine anyone would be watching because they would be out also doing magikarp community but the fact that like niantic has made it easy to play at home and it's the middle of august and everyone's sweating i feel like a reasonable person would be like it is cold here i am cold i am literally wearing a sweatshirt and long pants because i'm so cold in minnie minneapolis in august you guys are a joke okay a reasonable human would be like hold on we are having a cold august it is normally a hundred degrees in august we are having a weird cold august so don't come at me with this nobody with his home you would never survive in dc it gets freaking hot here we have had a very cold summer i don't do good with in weather we don't do good with anything you would do better in whether if you weren't always wearing a hoodie and like four layers of clothing let's be real steve would do better in uh one of those bubble rooms where you can't get any like germs or allergens into the room that is his ideal environment with a bathroom he just wants to be you just want to be in a mall i had my summer jeans on and i had a moisture wicking under armor white t-shirt on uh as good as i can get anyways a reasonable person would be like it's august magikarp is not that exciting i'm gonna turn on an incense i'm gonna watch twitch or anime and i'm gonna catch magikarp in my house where it's air conditioning yeah so i don't know if once covet is over in the future i can stream community days outside because those people would also be outside we are in a unique situation at this time correct we will be in this unique situation for at least a year but for these people coming in just like i get it right you're at home i'm i'm the one out there trying to see deoxys trying to get deoxys for people i'm trying to show people milwaukee uh provide good content but these people that come in and they just spam their friend code or they're just desperately asking for deoxys about man a hello goes so far just to be like hello how's it going wow like your stream this is a beautiful park you're like just and then they wonder why they're not getting invited to race because they don't even know how to say hello look hello waste time we all know what we're there for get me to the prize give me my shine i'm go i got i

at almost a hundred people that want this not actual music music uh have you seen the cassette tape yeah i've said tape is fire yes nick has been doing most of the kickstarter work uh nick is the one reaching out making sure that uh the cassette tape looks good uh nick presented me with a bunch of different cassette tape designs and we went with the the like semi-clear purple one which looks really really great yeah it does uh although greg could you have the lawyers note that steve just acknowledged that someone else is doing the majority of the work i would like to have that on the official record thank you oh i mean all of these are being submitted in to cart official records so i mean we are you going to use his own words against him that's that's the best way to do it nick is still getting the mastering and stuff done for it and then we will uh we will be doing some stretch goals this week you want to uh don't you have to indicate that you're partnered with dina dna before you talk about mastering no i was like no i don't i still don't know what mastering is it's really make the music better and make the message a hidden stretch goal being a part of the lawsuit so reach out separately um and we'll get you on the class action you can find me on twitter you'll hear but at the end of the show so thank you to everyone who pledged i know that some people have expressed they want the cassette tape uh but it's at a pretty high reward tier we're working with it nick is nick is doing what he can to i don't know do the music stuff he's the music guy he's gonna make the musics that come into your ear holes yeah i know nothing else about the musics cause that's all that happens but then part of the uh part of one of the pledges is nick's new album which comes out in october i think and so he'll be it's like for five dollars extra you get next album um which you should do because obviously nick is a very talented musician um but i believe nick will be announcing his album in either this week or next week so that'll be in the kickstarter too anyways kickstarter in the show notes below thank you to everyone who's pledged we'll keep you updated as we're going uh that ends at the end of the month so you got time for that too okay speaking of money let's get back to the pokemon news nintendo's financials came out again we got some good news and some bad news bad news first bad news is we have no clue how many copies of isle of armor have sold because they don't report on dlc what yeah good news that's real shady yeah they're hiding in the last like three months sword and shield has sold another million copies which is pretty good um so this is off nintendolife.com uh and this was also sent in by brandon in our slack community nintendo's should we do do should we do nintendo switches top top 10 selling games as of june yeah what are they number 10 we'll go bottom up new super mario brother u deluxe at 7.4 million did they do another wii u game on the switch yeah that was a launch game i think talk about quit now frauds wow splatoon 2 10.71 million you could argue that that was just an enhanced version of splatoon honestly super mario party 10.9 million number seven let's go pikachu let's go eevee 12.2 million copies uh which is uh right on the heels i think of heart gold soul silver probably we'll pass it this holiday i'm assuming new super mario odyssey 18 million copies pokemon sword and pokemon shield 18.8 million um legend of zelda breath of wild which is a launch game 18.6 million new super mar smash brothers ultimate that came out like a week after let's go pikachu let's go leave you right 19.9 million animal crossing new horizons which has only been out for what three months now 22.4 million jeez and mario kart 8 deluxe 26.8 million what about super paper mario mario paper whatever that is i don't think that paper paper mario paper i don't think they got reported because that came out in july it's only like a month old yeah this this is yeah this is the end of june i think is these numbers so that puts the total here of lifetime sales you have pokemon red blue and green 31 million copies lifetime gold and silver 23 million copies pokemon sword and shield the third best-selling pokemon game of all time 18.22 diamond and pearl following that with 17.64 x and y after that with 16.45 ruby and sapphire with 16.22 pokemon sun and moon with 16.18 and out of all eight generations black and white at the last spot with fifteen point six four so be fair those are the best games fifteen point six four million copies of a game sold is still incredibly impressive a lot of games i i bet in like 10 years when we look back black and white cutting every pokemon and adding 150 new ones was would be is more controversial than sword and shield oh absolutely 100 correct people were so mad about that even though once you beat the game you could transfer them all in but people were just mad that they couldn't start with their salamance black and white are good games though dang they're very good i've been saying this for eight years now he doesn't listen we got that right he will spout it out like it was his idea when we have been harping on ask him about gen 2 the season finale of this podcast will be me saying i invented pokemon i wish that was a joke it's gonna happen the season finale what what are our seasons i don't know like are we still in season one because this has been a heck of a long season well you know once you go to season two you get that you get that sophomore slump no true this week darkness ablaze will be available what is that the new tcc we talked about last week no we talked about champions path last week yeah we talked about that we also know we also brought up darkness ablaze because i was like don't they come out with sets quarterly blah blah blah they're like yeah darkness ablaze is the current one blah blah blah that's that's how i hear the podcast i just i just totally just blanked out for this whole section darkness ablaze august 14th is the official release date uh it will feature 185 cards oh gosh i will have gmax or sorry gmax vmax don't forget your v card at the door here vmax grim snarl hydragon is in the set butterfree vmax crobat v polti guys all in this set so old hydrogon was one of my favorite tcg cars is this new hydrogon a good card it uh has 160 hp uh it has a two darkness one colorless attack that just does 130 called pitch black fangs and its ability which is the more important thing is called dark squall as often as you would like during your turn you may attach a darkness energy from your hand to one of your pokemon so it is the same it's very similar to well it's similar to the old one the old one you used to you'd be you could move energy around yes yeah because people would run high dragon and dark cry that was my main deck dude they would move the energy off cry heal it and then move the energy back correct okay the only thing i care about are there any rosalia in this set i don't know but the butterfree art is amazing if you didn't see that butterfree v max is real real good i don't care about butterfree oh okay never mind what about what about polti guys um okay i'm listening there's a lot of good colors in the background there uh i can't i don't know what set this is it might be darkness ablaze there's a gay panpour in the set i don't even know what that means oh there is what rosalie or panpour panpour there's no resilience of this set of garbage yeah but you get gay pancor look i don't have to support every gay that exists exactly i was going to say something bothers will when i do exactly what that true also it's a cute pamper though come on yeah i mean for those monkeys now you got a harsh i was like i will say panpour is my favorite of the monkeys uh the elemental monkeys yeah i'd probably agree with you pam is pretty pretty okay compared to the rest there's a roulette though oh this is serena okay this isn't a terrible set i won't play this game but last bit of news is that zarud is now available to ticket holders i don't recall you a traveling to japan in the last week or be living there look i don't know what you heard greg i know our slash pokemon strongly believes that japan doesn't know how to use twitter twitch youtube and pretty much all of the internet but i can correct i can confirm that they know how to use ebay and we have people that listen to the podcast they live in japan oh i see so you uh this is going into the lawsuit so if you have been scammed by steve with promises of follow-ups for getting him uh ticket prices and free codes from japan and he has not followed through yes this is filed under the um access to japanese assets section of the lawsuit so just yeah make sure you put it in that one there thanks at white wing i will be collecting them all so i got my master's doctorate and lawyering so it's i'm guaranteed to win this has come up a lot where so i got so rude had somebody purchase a movie ticket they sent me the code on the ticket so this is how it works we'll back up we'll explain this uh so our our listeners walk away knowing more than the common folk so in japan uh if you want to go to like a wrestling show if you want to go to a play if you want to go to a movie if you want to go to like disney land world i don't know which one is there uh it's called disney japan or something like tokyo disney yeah tokyo disney if you want to go to any of these events all you have to do is go into the thousands of 7-elevens that are literally next to each other in japan you can't walk out of a 7-eleven without seeing another 7-eleven and inside the 7-elevens are these atms they look like atms but they're they're just boxes that with a touch screen that you can buy tickets from so you walk into a 7-eleven you go to the touchscreen you go you want to go to purchase a movie ticket purchase movie ticket for coco which is the new pokemon movie coming out in japan those tickets went on sale on august 7th you purchased the ticket for i think a movie ticket there is like 10 bucks so it's like 800 yen or something like that and then when you purchase it it prints it out right there and then on that receipt is your movie ticket and your code for shiny celebi and for zeroed and ever since let's go pikachu let's go eevee ever since the switch let's go pikachu and let's go evie sword and shield all are region free with with the codes um that's why i like that korean among us anyone can download uh if there was a giovanni event for let's go pikachu let's go eevee only in the u.s at best buy but if you a u.s person gave that to a japanese person they'd be able to redeem that um if you were to go to japan and get the birthday birthday evie birthday chancy i think it's chansey yeah i think it's chancy doesn't matter uh that code will still work this was different than like sun and moon and the ds stuff so when i was part of the pokemon secret club which that involved you walking into a pokemon center spending 800 yen to get a secret cub club membership and then redeem it they gave out a shiny necrozma through secret club but it would only work on a japanese version i think it oh gosh not the game it would it was specific to the the the console i think because i had to send it to a friend that had a japanese 3ds to then redeem it to then trade it to me it was very complicated but none of that none of that matters anymore it seems like all these switch games as long as you have the code secret club also gave out a shiny crabby for let's go pikachu let's go eevee which i was able to redeem no problem a couple things here if you want zarud i'm trying not to say zera aura because that keeps popping up on my mind you want zarud and shiny celebi ebay seems to be offering it for about fifteen dollars which goes back to our conversation about deoxys is deox is worth the amount of rain passes that you're putting into it i don't know it is shiny celebi worth the 15 to you so you don't have to play pokemon crystal and soft reset that yes maybe is the rude worth 15 maybe although the the this is what i would recommend if you have a friend in japan and you convince them to walk down to a 7-eleven to get you a ticket it's probably going to cost them like 10 bucks but obviously people on ebay want to make a profit that's why they're charging 15. they're actually double dipping so this is what happens with a person on an ebay they buy the movie ticket they sell the code separately on ebay and then they sell the movie ticket again back to somebody who wants to see the movie but doesn't care about the codes at a cheaper price than they would buy the they got it made it's fine who wants to see the movie without the code yeah parents i don't know i mean parents there's the power of us like we it's out there that stinker that we have no faith in the movie franchise any longer if i'm choking over here if you go the ebay route and you decide that you cannot wait you want chinese celebi you want zarud if you decide to go the ebay route only purchase from a seller that says they will send you a code it will read the description if they send you a code that's fine also if they're charging like three bucks it's uh it's it's hacked if the seller says we will trade you the zarood and the celebi after you pay those are hacked pk hexed duplicated holding a master ball perfect ivs i cannot here's here's some good signs zarud and celebi only three perfect ivs guaranteed not six not five not four three the rood will be holding leftovers celebi will be holding lucky eggs not master balls they will have to have that ribbon it's like i don't remember what the ribbon is called it's like a red ribbon they're in cherish balls they both come at level 60 so again any ebay auction that says level 100 it's a rude from the movie holding master ball it's just they're just taking your money and giving you a pk hex pokemon that they've duplicated 100 plus times if you get the code for the 15 bucks or 16 or 17 however much they're charging now you enter the code manually in your own nintendo switch it'll show up in your items you'll see it you can it'll it'll be in the history of like all your battle points your your gallerian ponyta you redeemed your um ball guy shirt that you've gotten it'll show up in your history and everything now if you don't want to pay any money for pokemon this is the question i keep getting are we going to get the rude is the rude going to come here is this the only way to get so rude i don't know where you guys have been for the last 20 years every year there is a pokemon movie every year that movie features a mythical pokemon and every year they usually line up together in the u.s so when did we get zera ora the first time when that bad zera aura movie came to theaters although i believe you had to go to gamestop to get the zera aura but it was the same time when did we get hoopa when that bad hoopa movie came to the u.s i actually don't know if that was bad i've been told this bad i haven't seen it when did we get volcanion volcanion when the volcanion movie came this has been this has been ongoing for a long time so when are we going to get so rude when the movie in the u.s gets officially announced i am hedging my bets that it will go straight to netflix because netflix is buying anything they can and putting it on their service for exclusivity and i'm assuming that they will release the rude either at a gamestop a best buy a target or through pokemon home when the movie is ready to come to the united states there is no way they're having people go to a retail location yeah you're probably right i was so some um something magically happens between now and november i don't think there's gonna be any uh i don't know nope there's no magic in the world to solve this problem the there is a a small question of like it's it may be fairly obvious that we'll eventually get zeroed but i think people are worried about us maybe not getting the shiny celebi i don't know it's happened before yeah it has happened before and if you live in australia you don't get any of these i think australia eventually got zero but there was a point in time where they seemed very forgotten about i don't know is is 15 bucks worth it to you guys for these pokemon it's more worth it in a game that i have multiple ways of moving it around so i can get it into home i can get it to other future games i can like that that ecosystem is has me more willing to spend money i i can just be patient it will come someday yeah i don't think they're going to be like you know what that was the rude for you if you do get the zeroed though if you're if you're if you've got money to burn you want to improve the japanic economy by giving money to ebayers um if you take your zarood to the professor in the train station in the isle of armor she will give you an ash hat that you can wear on your trainer which is a little nice bonus this will also work if you don't care about zarood but you care about the hat you can borrow as a rude from your friend oh talk to the lady and then trade the zuru back and then you unlock the hat is this the lady out on the island no it's the one in the train station she's the one that evaluates your pokedex she'll be she'll say something like wow i've this pokemon isn't in the pokedex and then she'll well it does it i mean she's on the island she is on the island just in the train station on the island no chinese route it is shiny locked there is a different zeroed in the game code um i believe bulbapedia calls it dada zarood what uh like daddy but it is the zeroed with the pink celebi cape oh okay which like ash greninja i was gonna say more like az's floette yeah okay yeah yeah the thing that never appeared you think that they would have distributed that one because that one that's coming in 2021 that one is more for the movie that is not available in the game either jeez no pokemon masters news nothing nothing's happening nothing nothing is happening i'm shocked i think terrible i i think this is the calm before the one year anniversary storm yeah question of the week greg yes sbj please don't blame me for what you see i just ask for the questions of the week sbj please you know what i seek please ask us the questions of the week and there's a lot of just three good questions this week yeah there were shout outs shout out to slack yeah that's a toughy so i don't know what you're gonna pick because i like them all maybe i'll just maybe we'll just save these three questions for the next three episodes i guess i'll go with brandon has there ever been a pokemon that despite its popularity what it stands for or the culture created that you wish never existed what i'm gonna wish it away into the nowhere place i mean i don't i don't care about the charizard popularity i don't really either and it's never really bothered me it's just like i don't know like doesn't for like like literally every star wars fan like loves r2d2 and cp well r2d2 let's not go that far right like every star wars fan loves bb-8 yeah because bb-8 is great so it's like charizard is just that just at a in the pokemon world like people just like it you despise because of its popularity what it stands for or the culture it created that you wish never existed gee maybe jinx yeah it's like it's it's not and it doesn't respond to any of those three prompts well i will say this i do think i do sort of wish jinx didn't exist based off of the culture that it stands for because people use it for very it's already on the edge and then people use it as either like a super poor suggestive joke which is like don't don't lean into it or use it as a criticism of the existing franchise well like look what they did here 25 years ago um so i think definitely created the culture it definitely created a culture of negativity on both sides that i don't particularly care for and if if that went away and we just had smoocham i would be happy or if we got an evolution and we could just get past it or something yeah i think jinx is probably the one that affects culture the most or they just keep changing it slightly yeah yeah so yeah i i so i have an answer okay you ready yep and it's like i don't i don't have anything against the pokemon i think it's an ugly pokemon not definitely not one of my favorites but it still has a right to exist i'm sure somebody out there is a huge fan but all the diggers be memes that were just like so pointless it diggers me though it just like wasted like that fraction of my brain power and then it kept coming up over and over and over again that it became more than a fraction of my brainpower that i resent that so i resent the diggers be memes i don't diggers be on its own is weird hand ears that's fine diggersby prior to that meme was a was probably one of the most shocking evolutions i've ever seen like like not knowing what bundle b was going to evolve into and then seeing it evolve into that i was like whoa what happened i don't i don't think there's ever been a pokemon that i've hated because of its popularity like i don't get why lucario is popular other than people like buy into the marketing um well i mean because right that that just the premise behind that question is like hipster mentality of oh everybody likes this so i can't like this yeah well you know what that new taylor swift album straight fire will anderson loves it so don't be hating on taylor swift i'm not a swifty will pokemon of the week oh boy you guys ain't ready for this but last week's pokemon of the week blah blah blah something about will anderson playing classical guitar why does he bother us with his personal life has nothing to do with pokemon of the week or so you think music in the gen 5 black and white games you had to do perform certain tasks unlock portions of the sound track one of those tasks you had to show a pokemon to the piano player in a cubiela town in the upper right hand corner but strangely enough that pokemon was not available in black and white too so you had to go through all kinds of mechanisms to breed it or to trade it in to get it into the game so you could show it to that person so you could unlock the piano track for a cumulation i mean and i also use the word tater i think i have it right who was the pokemon last week it's lucario no cricket cricket hot correct yeah it's got a good shiny i like i do like the orangey shirt uh it's a little too subtle for me oh really i think yeah i prefer uh like a a more like this is good i prefer to to avoid the joltik issue um and to have a very distinctive did you just say joltik has a distinct shiny yeah his eyes are a whole different color dude i literally read extra shiny joel ticks because i didn't realize that i had gotten the shiny you should have looked into its eyes okay it's like six star in science his eyes are pretty different that's it that's literally the biggest difference right there is the color of the eyes yeah you just gotta look at the eyes they're not that different what one is like blue and the other is purple blue and purple yes colors you know the color that comes right after blue purple oh my goodness it's like like if you said it's blue and red okay there blue and purple yep darker blue i would say he's pretty noticeable could i get some tater tot uh trivia facts please yeah it's got at least the only pokemon with the base that total of 194 true to its pokedex entry krikitat's cry sounds like uh that of a xylophone cricket evolves at the lowest level of a pokemon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary line being at level 10. interesting there who evolves lower than level 10 out of all pokemon well there's some pokemon you could level you could you could develop a level one that's true because category evolves at seven well but there's ones that also do item leveling so you can just automatically you can evolve them yeah you can breed a rosalia and then immediately evolve it yeah at level one which just seems a little why are we forcing our children to grow up so fast because they need to get into the battle and fight well uh for those who don't know because maybe you don't pay as much attention to pokemon as other people uh pre-evolutions learn moves faster than evolved pokemon so keep that in mind but what if i brought all the moves on it that i want oh who how can you breed four egg moves oh you'd be surprised oh geez i'm a master breeder how's that shuffle icon for cricket tottenham it's pretty good it's cute green dot's a really cute pokemon yeah it's a little tight a little tater tot the tater tot with a collar don't put it in your hot dish though because it is a bug it's got a xylophone chest all right this week's pokemon we're going easy on folks because i've been a little difficult lately we got a review that said you were too easy oh what i didn't see that review said make pokemon of the week harder oh i'll make it real harder it'll be one letter i'll give you one letter next week folks get start start start your brain power in advance because i'm giving you one letter and you gotta pick up pokemon can we play name that pokemon i can name that pokemon in 15 letters and it's not any of the unknowns um here we go when perusing the sinnoh pokedex you need to venture quite far down the list before you encounter any ice type pokemon even though sinnoh is definitely of a northern climate the first few pokemon that include ice type are not primarily ice type the first one that is primarily ice type is a mono ice type and then we have this week's pokemon which is the first dual type pokemon in sinnoh that is ice type first before its second typing of additional intrigue is that this pokemon cannot be caught in the wild in diamond pearl platinum heart gold or soul silver startling as this pokemon was first introduced in the fourth generation games in fact the only games where this pokemon can be caught in the wild are black and white and black and white too this pokemon can only be obtained in other games by meeting the special evolution conditions placed upon its predecessor evolution conditions similar to those that exist for tangela in one of those life imitates pokemon moments in 2019 scientists attempted to jurassic park some dna from a mummy that was found in the siberian permafrost in 2011. you can read all about it in the march 14 2019 article in the web magazine live science they were not successful but if they had been we may have seen the animal this pokemon was based on walking in the real world again not a dinosaur okay that is your pokemon of the week i made it super easy for all the folks who found it too hard lately if you're finding it too easy you're lying because sometimes i put in false things that's not true that's not true i do play classical guitar we'll be back next week with another show for you guys uh kickstarter till the end of the month
