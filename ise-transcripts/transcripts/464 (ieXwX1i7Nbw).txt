i don't think i look every once in a (5:09 - 5:12)
while (5:12 - 5:16)
and i put out into the universe to (5:12 - 5:19)
run into togepi lover and it has never (5:16 - 5:20)
manifested (5:19 - 5:22)
that's why on twitch our little heart is (5:20 - 5:23)
a togepi it was a reference to (5:22 - 5:27)
togepi lover deep cuts here that is such (5:23 - 5:28)
a lie (5:27 - 5:31)
no this one that's literally why the (5:28 - 5:33)
heart that on my twitch channel is a (5:31 - 5:34)
togepi heart (5:33 - 5:38)
is to signify our love for togepi lover (5:34 - 5:39)
is that a big teeny in front of your (5:38 - 5:41)
microphone (5:39 - 5:45)
yeah it is that's the most (5:41 - 5:46)
the most joy we're getting out of will (5:45 - 5:48)
this episode i mean (5:46 - 5:51)
steve's got a munchlax i do have a (5:48 - 5:52)
munchlax i do (5:51 - 5:56)
yeah also i was (5:52 - 5:58)
this is where i failed i was going to (5:56 - 6:00)
say you need to get rid of those rolls (5:58 - 6:02)
of toilet paper (6:00 - 6:06)
and i have 30 rolls of bts toilet paper (6:02 - 6:08)
which you will never use are you (6:06 - 6:10)
seriously going to move that to (6:08 - 6:11)
minnesota (6:10 - 6:13)
no i'll probably okay we will eventually (6:11 - 6:14)
here's the here's the problem (6:13 - 6:17)
before we go they become worthless okay (6:14 - 6:20)
the h mart in chicago had like three (6:17 - 6:22)
full aisles dedicated to this toilet (6:20 - 6:24)
paper if i need more i'll go back (6:22 - 6:26)
but one they were the sh the show is (6:24 - 6:29)
secretly called two things number one (6:26 - 6:33)
first thing is uh they do sell this on (6:29 - 6:34)
ebay (6:33 - 6:36)
i'm not sure who's buying it number two (6:34 - 6:39)
is i have the world's smallest bathroom (6:36 - 6:41)
and normally irene and i 100 certified (6:39 - 6:42)
truth (6:41 - 6:44)
yes uh normally irene and i we buy like (6:42 - 6:46)
the six pack of toilet paper because (6:44 - 6:47)
that's all that fits in our (6:46 - 6:50)
closet outside the bathroom this is 30 (6:47 - 6:50)
rolls (6:50 - 6:53)
i can't put it anywhere besides this (6:50 - 6:54)
room right now (6:53 - 6:57)
i have no space for it and you're never (6:54 - 7:00)
going to open it it would devalue (6:57 - 7:03)
ebay scalpers will be like are all 30 (7:00 - 7:04)
rolls in there and you know she's like (7:03 - 7:05)
nah (7:04 - 7:08)
the truest bts fans are using the toilet (7:05 - 7:10)
paper (7:08 - 7:13)
no they're not the truest (7:10 - 7:16)
the truest bts fans are buying the meal (7:13 - 7:16)
and then (7:16 - 7:19)
freeze locking it in a case to say these (7:16 - 7:20)
were the meals (7:19 - 7:22)
they will never touch that food yeah (7:20 - 7:24)
that's probably accurate (7:22 - 7:26)
um okay well let's get into pokemon news (7:24 - 7:29)
uh happy pride (7:26 - 7:32)
uh (7:29 - 7:32)
there's a new tournament uh it is called (7:42 - 7:45)
the (7:45 - 7:49)
fair and square pokemon competition (7:45 - 7:52)
so it's only square pokemon there's no (7:49 - 7:54)
that would be a cool (7:52 - 7:57)
rule um but this is (7:54 - 7:59)
uh series nine rules for pokemon sword (7:57 - 8:01)
and shield (7:59 - 8:03)
the it is single battles so i'm already (8:01 - 8:04)
passing (8:03 - 8:07)
uh duplicate pokemon and duplicate items (8:04 - 8:11)
are allowed and legendary (8:07 - 8:14)
single yeah i don't know because some (8:11 - 8:15)
people enjoyed that (8:14 - 8:16)
i mean i know but it seems weird that (8:15 - 8:18)
this is like (8:16 - 8:21)
after all these years a lot of these (8:18 - 8:22)
like (8:21 - 8:25)
off tournaments haven't (8:22 - 8:29)
have been singles uh unlike series nine (8:25 - 8:31)
regulations duplicate pokemon duplicate (8:29 - 8:32)
items are allowed and legendary pokemon (8:31 - 8:34)
are prohibited (8:32 - 8:37)
uh you cannot use pokemon like zapdos or (8:34 - 8:41)
shifu silvally the ultra beasts um (8:37 - 8:44)
by taking part in this challenge you (8:41 - 8:46)
will earn a participation of 50 battle (8:44 - 8:48)
points that's all you get no shirt (8:46 - 8:51)
nothing fancy (8:48 - 8:53)
they made a cool graphic for it though i (8:51 - 8:55)
guess (8:53 - 8:59)
it's like pink and gal isopod is on it (8:55 - 9:01)
that's cool (8:59 - 9:04)
it's it's i (9:01 - 9:07)
they definitely have a rainbow vibe in (9:04 - 9:08)
the (9:07 - 9:11)
sound wave or sound file thing that's in (9:08 - 9:12)
the back and i'm not (9:11 - 9:15)
understanding i don't understand that (9:12 - 9:17)
i don't understand the whole i regret is (9:15 - 9:18)
it cool looking graphic i don't (9:17 - 9:19)
understand (9:18 - 9:22)
what in there says fair and square the (9:19 - 9:23)
definitely not the wav (9:22 - 9:25)
files they grabbed off google and (9:23 - 9:28)
rainbows (9:25 - 9:28)
i wish there was so in ultrasound ultra (9:29 - 9:32)
moon there was like a lot of like (9:31 - 9:34)
fun tournaments like there was like a (9:32 - 9:35)
halloween tournament where you could (9:34 - 9:36)
only use like ghost type pokemon and (9:35 - 9:38)
like pikachu because (9:36 - 9:40)
obviously you can always have you can't (9:38 - 9:41)
have a tournament that pikachu (9:40 - 9:43)
um there was like a tournament at one (9:41 - 9:44)
point in ultrasound ultramoon where you (9:43 - 9:46)
could only use pokemon that were like a (9:44 - 9:46)
certain height (9:46 - 9:48)
and if they were above that height they (9:46 - 9:50)
were disqualified oh right (9:48 - 9:52)
i remember that these these have kind of (9:50 - 9:53)
like they've been (9:52 - 9:55)
doing a great job at you know changing (9:53 - 9:57)
the rules banning pokemon (9:55 - 10:01)
adding new pokemon all that stuff but (9:57 - 10:05)
their side things have been a little (10:01 - 10:08)
lackluster i don't know somebody (10:05 - 10:09)
probably get joy out of it i'm sure (10:08 - 10:11)

uh and do their little quests you'll get (14:17 - 14:21)
battle points and the battle points will (14:19 - 14:24)
allow you to summon (14:21 - 14:28)
special bp sync pairs (14:24 - 14:33)
uh so if you haven't picked up masters (14:28 - 14:34)
a bunch of the new events have been (14:33 - 14:36)
really fun the stories have been good (14:34 - 14:36)
but (14:36 - 14:39)
now there's also an extra reward for (14:36 - 14:40)
actually (14:39 - 14:42)
completing these events you get you move (14:40 - 14:44)
up in tears the more points you get (14:42 - 14:47)
the more access to the various special (14:44 - 14:49)
bp pairs you get so (14:47 - 14:50)
i we didn't talk about it it is the (14:49 - 14:52)
thing they added it's a little confusing (14:50 - 14:55)
but once you look at the daily rewards (14:52 - 14:56)
screen (14:55 - 14:59)
there's a new bp symbol a new bp coin uh (14:56 - 15:00)
once you collect enough the entire (14:59 - 15:01)
screen (15:00 - 15:03)
forces you to look at it and says you're (15:01 - 15:05)
at 200 points and this is your new (15:03 - 15:06)
reward (15:05 - 15:09)
um so it's a pretty cool way to actually (15:06 - 15:12)
add additional reason to replay or (15:09 - 15:15)
try for the higher level stuff is to get (15:12 - 15:16)
the bp (15:15 - 15:18)
points so you can get your unique sync (15:16 - 15:19)
pairs where (15:18 - 15:23)
what is two year august september (15:19 - 15:26)
we have we're getting close i think yeah (15:23 - 15:26)
we're getting close (15:26 - 15:29)
is it going to be like pokemon masters g (15:26 - 15:30)
gx (15:29 - 15:31)
are they are they keeping the eff (15:30 - 15:34)
giganta gigantomaxics (15:31 - 15:36)
well i would assume that that's like (15:34 - 15:38)
that has to be their two-year plan right (15:36 - 15:39)
like (15:38 - 15:41)
gigantomax has to be the two-year (15:39 - 15:42)
anniversary (15:41 - 15:44)
i i kind of hope that like i am (15:42 - 15:46)
partnered with dna i have no clue what (15:44 - 15:47)
they're doing for their two years (15:46 - 15:48)
sometimes they let me know when (15:47 - 15:49)
characters are coming early (15:48 - 15:52)
so yeah they could have i don't know (15:49 - 15:53)
they got megan's they got this sort of (15:52 - 15:54)
feels like (15:53 - 15:58)
the z moves and the sink pairs sort of (15:54 - 15:59)
fill that same (15:58 - 16:02)
slot yeah i would assume gigantomax does (15:59 - 16:03)
too (16:02 - 16:05)
yeah because because they already said (16:03 - 16:06)
leon's (16:05 - 16:09)
charizard's gigantic max like like right (16:06 - 16:10)
they said they're going to do it they (16:09 - 16:11)
didn't say how (16:10 - 16:13)
yeah they well okay i guess they said (16:11 - 16:15)
gigantomax is coming they didn't (16:13 - 16:16)
specifically say leon is (16:15 - 16:20)
leon is the only one in the game (16:16 - 16:23)
we know now nessa i didn't get b (16:20 - 16:26)
either i'm so mad at that game um i (16:23 - 16:27)
didn't even get a chance to pull on (16:26 - 16:31)
pull on nessa uh i want like the thing i (16:27 - 16:34)
i guess i would want overhauled is there (16:31 - 16:37)
are a lot of characters and masters now (16:34 - 16:40)
and they're all in like every banner so (16:37 - 16:43)
it's getting harder and harder to (16:40 - 16:45)
get what you want because it's like (16:43 - 16:47)
every five star is like point (16:45 - 16:49)
zero three percent poll rate and then (16:47 - 16:50)
because that all has to (16:49 - 16:52)
equal two percent or not yeah two (16:50 - 16:53)
percent not two percent um (16:52 - 16:57)
seven percent yeah uh so (16:53 - 16:58)
they need to like i don't know they i (16:57 - 17:00)
don't know how they fix that of like (16:58 - 17:05)
this is a water grass banner this is a (17:00 - 17:07)
fire steel banner i don't i don't know (17:05 - 17:09)
how other games deal with (17:07 - 17:11)
the gotcha problem when you have however (17:09 - 17:13)
many characters they have at this point (17:11 - 17:15)
i mean so i can tell you for like (17:13 - 17:18)
dragalia lost they will run (17:15 - 17:22)
um galas so they'll say this is a (17:18 - 17:26)
light gala and so they'll still pick (17:22 - 17:30)
certain light attuned heroes (17:26 - 17:32)
like five of them that have a higher (17:30 - 17:33)
chance (17:32 - 17:35)
uh and then everybody else remains the (17:33 - 17:36)
same (17:35 - 17:39)
like in masters they just did the hoenn (17:36 - 17:42)
banner so hoenn five stars are more (17:39 - 17:43)
likely to pull (17:42 - 17:46)
on oh that's cool i miss that um (17:43 - 17:50)
it just happened today or yesterday (17:46 - 17:52)
i should i should log into masters now (17:50 - 17:53)
that we're talking about get my gems (17:52 - 17:54)
here (17:53 - 17:56)
i do like how masters keeps changing (17:54 - 17:58)
their icon it's a little thing but i (17:56 - 17:58)
kind of (17:58 - 18:03)
yeah kind of into it uh (17:58 - 18:08)
groupon and kroger fighting it out (18:03 - 18:08)
so i imagined because they're again (18:09 - 18:12)
their banners are (18:11 - 18:15)
becoming a problem um they're kind (18:12 - 18:16)
they've always been messy and there's (18:15 - 18:18)
been too many of them but i like the (18:16 - 18:18)
trend (18:18 - 18:22)
of region specific (18:18 - 18:25)
like honing it into that (18:22 - 18:29)
um like (18:25 - 18:30)
like you kind of know what you're going (18:29 - 18:32)
to end up with and like whoa i didn't (18:30 - 18:34)
know they were 12 (18:32 - 18:38)
fair chance yeah they're much higher (18:34 - 18:40)
oh but they're one percent overall what (18:38 - 18:42)
is this little icon next to it what (18:40 - 18:43)
little icon (18:42 - 18:44)
when you click on like the so it says (18:43 - 18:46)
twelve percent for five stars and then (18:44 - 18:47)
it says archie's a one percent but it (18:46 - 18:50)
has like a little metal next to it (18:47 - 18:52)
oh this probably says right here which (18:50 - 18:54)
banner are you one are she's (18:52 - 18:57)
yeah so when you go down to offering (18:54 - 18:59)
right (18:57 - 18:59)
let me get over there (18:59 - 19:02)
fascinating audio content oh (19:04 - 19:11)
we'll fill the void (19:07 - 19:14)
i here's my pokemon masters update i (19:11 - 19:15)
still don't play (19:14 - 19:18)
or log in i i believe that is (19:15 - 19:21)
the featured master sync pair so if you (19:18 - 19:23)
look on the front page of it (19:21 - 19:25)
it's got the same oh i see scsc so (19:23 - 19:27)
that's the one (19:25 - 19:28)
in that banner like if you go click over (19:27 - 19:30)
to maxi it's the same (19:28 - 19:33)
but normally they're two percent yeah so (19:30 - 19:34)
they increased it from ten percent to (19:33 - 19:36)
twelve percent (19:34 - 19:37)
but they decreased it from two percent i (19:36 - 19:39)
don't know if i like that yeah i'm a (19:37 - 19:39)
little (19:39 - 19:41)
i'm a little miffed about it because all (19:39 - 19:43)
of my things have been bad (19:41 - 19:46)
hmm (19:43 - 19:46)
i only got 8 000 gems (19:47 - 19:54)
i have 400 because i didn't get (19:50 - 19:58)
i didn't get archie i'm so mad (19:54 - 20:01)
dna give me steve's gems (19:58 - 20:05)
jerks get that stipend (20:01 - 20:06)
i have not gotten my june stipend yet (20:05 - 20:08)
maybe well give it to me (20:06 - 20:12)
maybe i'll go go crazy uh okay (20:08 - 20:15)
let's switch gears a little bit this was (20:12 - 20:16)
sent in by (20:15 - 20:18)
chris in our slack community this is the (20:16 - 20:19)
good dirt (20:18 - 20:23)
which chris uh the chris g (20:19 - 20:25)
new jersey chris yeah well i didn't want (20:23 - 20:28)
to talk some will (20:25 - 20:31)
yes because there's no there's (20:28 - 20:34)
only there's only one (20:31 - 20:37)
we're going to ignore chris christie who (20:34 - 20:38)
chris (20:37 - 20:41)
in new jersey begged us to ignore (20:38 - 20:44)
he will forever be saddled with that is (20:41 - 20:45)
the chris of new jersey (20:44 - 20:50)
that everybody knows okay so (20:45 - 20:54)
[Laughter] (20:50 - 20:57)
number one uh pokemon cards are back at (20:54 - 20:58)
target (20:57 - 21:00)
uh that's part of the news that lasted a (20:58 - 21:01)
whole solid (21:00 - 21:04)
maybe three weeks i saw that i saw that (21:01 - 21:04)
i (21:04 - 21:08)
went into target today boots on the (21:04 - 21:09)
ground first-hand reporting i walked (21:08 - 21:11)
into a target (21:09 - 21:14)
and they had a plethora of pokemon cards (21:11 - 21:15)
they had nothing but booster packs but (21:14 - 21:16)
they had (21:15 - 21:18)
battle styles and they had vivid voltage (21:16 - 21:20)
and they had blister packs which are the (21:18 - 21:22)
three packs and they were limiting two (21:20 - 21:24)
cards per people (21:22 - 21:28)
per person um (21:24 - 21:31)
so uh there was like an aracudo promo i (21:28 - 21:32)
didn't have so i picked that up (21:31 - 21:34)
um and then i didn't see any sports (21:32 - 21:36)
cards although to be fair i don't think (21:34 - 21:37)
i've ever (21:36 - 21:38)
really specifically looked at what (21:37 - 21:41)
sports cards look like but i i (21:38 - 21:42)
don't think they're i don't think they (21:41 - 21:44)
brought back sports cards i could be (21:42 - 21:45)
wrong on that they come in foil (21:44 - 21:48)
packages and they're like just like (21:45 - 21:50)
these rectangular pieces of cardboard (21:48 - 21:50)
with (21:50 - 21:52)
ink on them sometimes it's okay (21:50 - 21:55)
reflective and hollow usually like a (21:52 - 21:56)
person in a baseball uniform i would (21:55 - 21:58)
assume yeah i mean if it's that kind of (21:56 - 22:00)
a sport sure but there's other sports (21:58 - 22:01)
out there (22:00 - 22:04)
there's there's a there's the there's (22:01 - 22:06)
the one that you play with your feet (22:04 - 22:08)
okay that's very popular in europe (22:06 - 22:10)
europe european (22:08 - 22:12)
feet let's put it this way it's very (22:10 - 22:13)
popular in (22:12 - 22:15)
all of the world that's not the united (22:13 - 22:18)
states of america (22:15 - 22:21)
uh word ball number two is the one that (22:18 - 22:24)
chris sent in and this is from (22:21 - 22:27)
ebay and they are updating their policy (22:24 - 22:27)
regarding (22:27 - 22:29)
cards i'm just going to read it it's (22:27 - 22:31)
relatively short (22:29 - 22:35)
i didn't i i normally kind of (22:31 - 22:36)
so this is just a screenshot of the (22:35 - 22:38)
rules or the the changes i (22:36 - 22:40)
like google search this and no one is (22:38 - 22:42)
really reporting on this (22:40 - 22:45)
um there was like i don't know like one (22:42 - 22:46)
article that kind of mentioned it but (22:45 - 22:47)
they didn't even like mention the (22:46 - 22:48)
changes (22:47 - 22:50)
which is like ebay's doing something (22:48 - 22:51)
about pokemon cards and then like didn't (22:50 - 22:53)
mention okay but this is what it is (22:51 - 22:55)
they say we are updating our bid (22:53 - 22:57)
retraction policy for sports (22:55 - 23:00)
trading cards non-sports trading cards (22:57 - 23:01)
and collectible card game (23:00 - 23:04)
auctions starting june 30th 2021 (23:01 - 23:06)
buyers will no longer have the ability (23:04 - 23:08)
to retract bids on trading card (23:06 - 23:10)
auctions without sellers approval (23:08 - 23:12)
sellers decisions to accept or reject (23:10 - 23:13)
the auction (23:12 - 23:17)
bid retraction requests will be final (23:13 - 23:19)
how the new auction bid retraction (23:17 - 23:21)
policy will work starting on june 30th (23:19 - 23:22)
if you want to retract your auction bid (23:21 - 23:24)
you must contact the seller via (23:22 - 23:25)
messaging on ebay (23:24 - 23:29)
boy that that that's not good (23:25 - 23:31)
and it's like still the same thing from (23:29 - 23:33)
like 2007 (23:31 - 23:36)
to request a retraction the seller at (23:33 - 23:38)
their sole discretion will be able to (23:36 - 23:40)
accept or decline your retraction (23:38 - 23:40)
request (23:40 - 23:42)
if the seller does not accept your (23:40 - 23:44)
request you can bid your bid can still (23:42 - 23:46)
win or lose the auction (23:44 - 23:48)
and you will still be required to make a (23:46 - 23:50)
payment on any winning bid you submit we (23:48 - 23:51)
also inform (23:50 - 23:53)
buyers for our bid retraction policy (23:51 - 23:56)
page that a bid is a binding (23:53 - 23:59)
contract as previously communica (23:56 - 24:02)
kinda as previously communicated as (23:59 - 24:03)
april 2021 (24:02 - 24:05)
if the item goes unpaid by the fifth (24:03 - 24:07)
calendar day the seller may cancel the (24:05 - 24:09)
uh order due to non-payment (24:07 - 24:11)
regularly missed payments may impact (24:09 - 24:14)
your account check out our unpaid item (24:11 - 24:16)
policy to learn more (24:14 - 24:20)
okay so yeah (24:16 - 24:22)
theoretically if you bid on something on (24:20 - 24:25)
ebay you you have to pay but also (24:22 - 24:27)
the worst thing that happens is they (24:25 - 24:29)
just suspend your account (24:27 - 24:31)
that's it like it's not like they take (24:29 - 24:32)
you to like (24:31 - 24:37)
court they take it yeah (24:32 - 24:40)
ebay courts come into fox but this is a (24:37 - 24:43)
like like there is a thing on ebay where (24:40 - 24:44)
people will (24:43 - 24:47)
like for like ps5s or or things that (24:44 - 24:49)
are obviously scalped people will make (24:47 - 24:51)
brand new accounts (24:49 - 24:53)
they'll get the bid up really high and (24:51 - 24:54)
then (24:53 - 24:56)
they don't pay and it doesn't matter (24:54 - 24:57)
because they made this fresh account (24:56 - 25:00)
and then the seller now wasted a week (24:57 - 25:01)
and they have to relist it (25:00 - 25:03)
the seller can get around that by saying (25:01 - 25:05)
like your account must be verified (25:03 - 25:07)
through a phone number or your account (25:05 - 25:09)
must be like 60 days old or your account (25:07 - 25:10)
must have at least like 10 bids (25:09 - 25:15)
so there's like ways around it uh but (25:10 - 25:16)
you could you can still get away with it (25:15 - 25:19)
with like relatively new scalpers or (25:16 - 25:20)
scalpers that are not like super tech (25:19 - 25:21)
savvy (25:20 - 25:24)
um so (25:21 - 25:26)
are you saying that this policy change (25:24 - 25:30)
is to protect the scalpers (25:26 - 25:30)
no i i (25:31 - 25:38)
but also yes but (25:35 - 25:42)
no but yes but likely (25:38 - 25:42)
this is how we speak in the midwest if (25:43 - 25:46)
it ends (25:46 - 25:50)
on the negative then it actually means (25:46 - 25:53)
no if it ends on the positive then it (25:50 - 25:54)
means (25:53 - 25:57)
no but if there's three in there then it (25:54 - 25:58)
means (25:57 - 26:02)
yes yes yes no yes (25:58 - 26:05)
there you go i don't like (26:02 - 26:07)
this is a personal thing i don't like (26:05 - 26:09)
that rule in general on ebay of like (26:07 - 26:11)
retracting your bid (26:09 - 26:14)
you've made the bid yeah but then i like (26:11 - 26:16)
just lost my job (26:14 - 26:17)
yeah and i was like i can't yeah now i (26:16 - 26:19)
can't fulfill my wallet (26:17 - 26:22)
i can't pay (26:19 - 26:22)
i i was i was on ambien (26:23 - 26:29)
and i thought it looked good and in the (26:27 - 26:30)
morning when i woke up (26:29 - 26:33)
i realized i had been on here all night (26:30 - 26:34)
i (26:33 - 26:37)
know a podcaster who literally has told (26:34 - 26:39)
the tale of how they had like a wish (26:37 - 26:40)
list (26:39 - 26:42)
on ebay of things that they would like (26:40 - 26:44)
dream of buying but never (26:42 - 26:47)
would actually pull the trigger and buy (26:44 - 26:49)
and they were literally on ambien (26:47 - 26:51)
and went ahead and just bought the (26:49 - 26:53)
entire wish list and didn't even realize (26:51 - 26:55)
it until the things started showing up (26:53 - 26:56)
at their door (26:55 - 26:59)
oh get wrecked basically i (26:56 - 27:02)
worked for a guy who (26:59 - 27:06)
listed he he was uh (27:02 - 27:08)
an owner of a startup so he had a lot of (27:06 - 27:10)
flowing cash (27:08 - 27:14)
and he was very spendy (27:10 - 27:16)
he would buy a bunch of things and then (27:14 - 27:18)
like two to three weeks later after (27:16 - 27:19)
buying said things he would be very (27:18 - 27:21)
bored of said things (27:19 - 27:23)
uh so he would list them on ebay and he (27:21 - 27:26)
would go around the office asking people (27:23 - 27:27)
if they had ebay accounts if they could (27:26 - 27:29)
bid on his thing to drive (27:27 - 27:32)
up the price wow who's the real scammer (27:29 - 27:36)
that's scammy which is against also (27:32 - 27:37)
against ebay's terms of service no (27:36 - 27:38)
better (27:37 - 27:42)
it was me i was the one (27:38 - 27:46)
that owned a startup company (27:42 - 27:46)
i'm yeah i'm i guess i would love to (27:47 - 27:56)
dive deeper into like what (27:52 - 27:58)
because obviously something is happening (27:56 - 27:59)
here with scalpers and selling cards as (27:58 - 28:00)
quickly as possible (27:59 - 28:03)
on ebay to get their money but also (28:00 - 28:05)
people use (28:03 - 28:06)
where are those what is that other like (28:05 - 28:08)
that iphone (28:06 - 28:11)
app not not facebook marketplace (28:08 - 28:14)
meetup no not meetup there's like a (28:11 - 28:16)
couple apps that are like (28:14 - 28:19)
sell it i think sell it is one anyways (28:16 - 28:20)
i'm sure people use that as well there's (28:19 - 28:22)
like a there's like a there's a (28:20 - 28:25)
app that is for selling shoes (28:22 - 28:28)
and i can't remember its name um yeah (28:25 - 28:29)
but they like sell nikes because nikes (28:28 - 28:31)
are like really scalped and stuff (28:29 - 28:33)
uh and then pokemon cards started (28:31 - 28:34)
appearing on that app as well we (28:33 - 28:36)
legit have a few sneaker freaks who (28:34 - 28:39)
listen to this program they can (28:36 - 28:41)
probably are preparing the tweets right (28:39 - 28:42)
now to let us know (28:41 - 28:45)
yeah i like literally i just love it i (28:42 - 28:46)
go on instagram and (28:45 - 28:50)
like see a pair of let me not use (28:46 - 28:52)
not appropriate language for this (28:50 - 28:54)
program but ugly (28:52 - 28:57)
you insert the word shoes and they're (28:54 - 28:59)
like i only wear them once (28:57 - 29:03)
two thousand dollars yeah (28:59 - 29:03)
so as of this recording as well (29:06 - 29:09)
circling back to the pokemon card stuff (29:10 - 29:16)
pokemon center listed uh the sword and (29:13 - 29:18)
shield chilling rain (29:16 - 29:21)
pokemon center elite trainer box (29:18 - 29:22)
which is weird i didn't notice this till (29:21 - 29:24)
bobby pointed it out (29:22 - 29:28)
so two things number one (29:24 - 29:30)
still in stock it's been in stock for (29:28 - 29:31)
eight hours (29:30 - 29:34)
this is the etb uh the other weird thing (29:31 - 29:37)
is that this is 50 which is not the (29:34 - 29:39)
normal price of an etb (29:37 - 29:42)
normally etbs are 40 and they come with (29:39 - 29:43)
eight packs (29:42 - 29:45)
and then there's there's the special (29:43 - 29:47)
etbs (29:45 - 29:50)
like dragons exalted or shining fates (29:47 - 29:53)
or hidden legends that are 50 (29:50 - 29:55)
and they come with 10 booster packs but (29:53 - 29:56)
that's because (29:55 - 29:59)
they're special and you can't buy (29:56 - 30:00)
booster packs single for those (29:59 - 30:02)
like the ones i just named they never (30:00 - 30:03)
sold singles you can only get them in (30:02 - 30:06)
blisters or whatnot (30:03 - 30:06)
so this (30:07 - 30:10)
on pokemon center which is still in (30:09 - 30:13)
stock (30:10 - 30:15)
is 50 and it's coming with 10 booster (30:13 - 30:16)
packs and it's coming (30:15 - 30:19)
um but like if you go to like best buy (30:16 - 30:20)
or target (30:19 - 30:22)
and you want the same chilling rain (30:20 - 30:24)
booster pack it's forty dollars for (30:22 - 30:28)
eight so it's not the same (30:24 - 30:33)
is it right so i guess pokemon like (30:28 - 30:33)
also they say purchase limit of 10. why (30:33 - 30:37)
are you (30:36 - 30:40)
just what why are you why (30:37 - 30:41)
they know this isn't why are they (30:40 - 30:44)
letting people buy 10 etbs (30:41 - 30:47)
well they're not so but they're still (30:44 - 30:48)
not out of stock (30:47 - 30:51)
so maybe this is a sign and i i said (30:48 - 30:52)
this (30:51 - 30:54)
months ago that we're going to start (30:52 - 30:55)
seeing with battle styles that people (30:54 - 30:56)
are going to get not (30:55 - 30:58)
interested because battle styles doesn't (30:56 - 31:00)
have charizard does that pikachu no one (30:58 - 31:01)
knows who an urshifu (31:00 - 31:04)
is and in chilling reigns there is (31:01 - 31:05)
articuno (31:04 - 31:06)
which i guess people know but people (31:05 - 31:08)
don't really care about them as much as (31:06 - 31:09)
they care about (31:08 - 31:11)
yeah i mean nobody cares as much as (31:09 - 31:14)
charizard right also is it the original (31:11 - 31:16)
uh it's not it's the gallerian one it's (31:14 - 31:18)
the nobody cares about those ugly fire (31:16 - 31:18)
chickens (31:18 - 31:21)
and (31:18 - 31:21)
do you know how badly people don't care (31:24 - 31:27)
about those ugly fire chickens (31:26 - 31:30)
i still haven't caught them in the game (31:27 - 31:30)
there you go (31:30 - 31:33)
that's how bad they are i am not saying (31:30 - 31:34)
that crown (31:33 - 31:35)
not crown thunder chilling reigns is (31:34 - 31:37)
gonna like solve all the problems and (31:35 - 31:39)
you'll be able to walk in but (31:37 - 31:42)
hey it's been this is this right here (31:39 - 31:44)
is 10 hours you can go to (31:42 - 31:46)
pokemoncenter.com (31:44 - 31:48)
you get the etb for the exact price it (31:46 - 31:50)
has did not sell out (31:48 - 31:53)
the battle styles etb sold out in (31:50 - 31:56)
less than 10 minutes the vivid uh what (31:53 - 31:57)
was that what was before that (31:56 - 32:00)
shining the one with each (31:57 - 32:02)
of shining faiths i don't they're all (32:00 - 32:03)
blending together now (32:02 - 32:07)
that sold out in 10 minutes (32:03 - 32:08)
it's been 10 hours i'm sure when the (32:07 - 32:09)
podcast goes up maybe i'll probably be (32:08 - 32:11)
sold out but (32:09 - 32:14)
uh this is a good sign that (32:11 - 32:17)
either i don't think their like robot (32:14 - 32:20)
check has gotten better definitely asked (32:17 - 32:21)
me multiple times when i was checking (32:20 - 32:22)
out if i was a robot (32:21 - 32:26)
i'm not i just wanted one of each etb (32:22 - 32:28)
uh so we'll see we'll see going into the (32:26 - 32:29)
summer (32:28 - 32:31)
we talked about this also before that (32:29 - 32:33)
like now that people are vaccinated (32:31 - 32:37)
people are traveling people are going to (32:33 - 32:40)
events they're spending their money (32:37 - 32:42)
elsewhere (32:40 - 32:44)
maybe they already got chonky pikachu (32:42 - 32:45)
they don't need another chunky pikachu (32:44 - 32:46)
in their life maybe they gave up on (32:45 - 32:47)
charizard they're (32:46 - 32:49)
moving their money elsewhere so uh (32:47 - 32:51)
hopefully the the card stuff has gotten (32:49 - 32:53)
better (32:51 - 32:54)
target apparently was like hey three (32:53 - 32:56)
weeks was long enough we solved the (32:54 - 32:57)
world (32:56 - 32:59)
issues cards are back well are they (32:57 - 33:01)
they're still not selling sports cards (32:59 - 33:03)
yeah which which you clarified was the (33:01 - 33:06)
true issue which is the true issue (33:03 - 33:09)
barnes and noble i went in the two days (33:06 - 33:11)
ago barnes and noble (33:09 - 33:13)

shiny where is there a barnes and noble (33:14 - 33:20)

hey they're always coming through with (33:28 - 33:32)

and we are back from our break (34:26 - 34:32)
this is not really pokemon related news (34:29 - 34:33)

end up being pokemon related news (34:33 - 34:37)

donkey kong is ready it doesn't say that (35:12 - 35:16)
on the website but it sounds like it (35:14 - 35:18)
because i'm still talking in this voice (35:16 - 35:20)
while this year's e3 has gone virtual (35:18 - 35:22)
everyone is invited to tune in (35:20 - 35:24)

twitch so if you want my bad takes (35:29 - 35:35)
live wait number one your voice was (35:31 - 35:38)
pokemon coliseum is what that was yeah (35:35 - 35:41)
number two did they retire the tree (35:38 - 35:42)
house of terror (35:41 - 35:44)
is that no longer a thing no they still (35:42 - 35:45)
did the treehouse (35:44 - 35:48)
okay remember the tree houses where they (35:45 - 35:50)
told everyone the national decks was (35:48 - 35:51)
getting cut (35:50 - 35:55)
i remember i remember last week with a (35:51 - 35:59)
thick haze so no (35:55 - 36:02)
do we think 40 minutes is for so they (35:59 - 36:03)
said 40 minutes of (36:02 - 36:06)
exclusively games software exclusively (36:03 - 36:10)
games coming out mainly for 2021 (36:06 - 36:12)
that sounds like pokemon makes that cut (36:10 - 36:13)
what else they got to fill (36:12 - 36:16)
it's 30 minutes of breath of the wild (36:13 - 36:17)
two (36:16 - 36:20)
no five minutes of switch oh wait you (36:17 - 36:22)
said not hardware switching (36:20 - 36:25)
specifically said software will be (36:22 - 36:28)
the software features of the switch pro (36:25 - 36:28)
i think so which (36:28 - 36:32)
includes some sort of me maker and (36:28 - 36:35)
background man playing on my 3ds and (36:32 - 36:37)
having those rotating backgrounds and (36:35 - 36:37)
the (36:37 - 36:41)
beautiful espeon background (36:37 - 36:45)
why can't i have that on my switch (36:41 - 36:48)
that's all black or white maybe (36:45 - 36:50)
while the c you see the switch is (36:48 - 36:51)
referencing the upcoming black and white (36:50 - 36:52)
three (36:51 - 36:54)
that's why you can't have other black (36:52 - 36:57)
and white remakes is where we're at (36:54 - 36:59)
uh there were the rumors is they're (36:57 - 37:01)
going to show off the switch pro before (36:59 - 37:05)
e3 so that when they're showing software (37:01 - 37:08)
they can then talk about why it would (37:05 - 37:09)
run better (37:08 - 37:12)
on the switch pro that's the rumor at (37:09 - 37:12)
least because it has (37:12 - 37:15)
4ks four (37:12 - 37:19)
not just komala 1000 ps (37:15 - 37:22)
uh i can't even think of three other k (37:19 - 37:24)
pokemon (37:22 - 37:24)
kangaskhan kangaskhan and uh (37:24 - 37:33)
mega kangaskhan the 4ks the 4ks (37:28 - 37:33)
they have to show diamond pearl right (37:33 - 37:38)
yeah (37:36 - 37:38)
they like i like absolutely show so (37:39 - 37:46)
last time in treehouse they like (37:42 - 37:48)
they i think they showed like the same (37:46 - 37:50)
trailer of sword and shield (37:48 - 37:53)
but then in the tree house they were (37:50 - 37:54)
playing sword and shield they were like (37:53 - 37:55)
in the wild area right (37:54 - 37:58)
because i remember you saw a bunch of (37:55 - 37:59)
wingles i remember this very clear you (37:58 - 38:01)
saw a bunch of wingles (37:59 - 38:03)
like flying around because people got (38:01 - 38:04)
mad that the like wiggle didn't fly (38:03 - 38:06)
properly even though it did (38:04 - 38:08)
uh and then she was like and then they (38:06 - 38:10)
still have random encounters in the (38:08 - 38:11)
grass and she like snuck up and then (38:10 - 38:12)
went to the grass and then (38:11 - 38:15)
another window popped up yeah i remember (38:12 - 38:16)
that (38:15 - 38:19)
so that was on treehouse yeah i'm pretty (38:16 - 38:21)
sure that was on treehouse that was (38:19 - 38:22)
definitely on treehouse (38:21 - 38:25)
um i don't know i don't if they're (38:22 - 38:26)
saying (38:25 - 38:29)
games releasing 2021 (38:26 - 38:32)
is breath of wild 2 coming out this year (38:29 - 38:35)
i didn't think so i didn't know no idea (38:32 - 38:36)
that's just the only thing that people (38:35 - 38:37)
actually (38:36 - 38:39)
want yeah i mean that's that's probably (38:37 - 38:41)
the most anticipated is (38:39 - 38:43)
you know what i want give me a new mario (38:41 - 38:44)
kart (38:43 - 38:47)
give me those were the days man those (38:44 - 38:48)
were the days (38:47 - 38:50)
you have a mario kart already that's a (38:48 - 38:52)
remake that's a really good it's an (38:50 - 38:53)
e-makeup (38:52 - 38:56)
email i see it's a it's an e-make of a (38:53 - 38:58)
wii u game (38:56 - 39:00)
not only is mario kart 8 deluxe the (38:58 - 39:02)
best-selling switch game (39:00 - 39:06)
to date but it's just a wii u game that (39:02 - 39:10)
they kind of just spiced up (39:06 - 39:11)
which is like mario kart 8 was very good (39:10 - 39:13)
i liked it a lot it was the best wii u (39:11 - 39:15)
game for sure we played a lot but (39:13 - 39:16)
it's it's even better selling than (39:15 - 39:18)
breath of the wild and oh yeah (39:16 - 39:22)
smash bros yes (39:18 - 39:22)
mario kart's always a top contender (39:22 - 39:30)
i need a mario kart 9. with pokemon they (39:27 - 39:31)
did make that vr (39:30 - 39:34)
mario kart is that yeah the one with the (39:31 - 39:35)
rc (39:34 - 39:38)
car no it didn't satisfy (39:35 - 39:40)
what you know how they put like isabelle (39:38 - 39:42)
and lincoln mario kart why can't pikachu (39:40 - 39:44)
be one (39:42 - 39:46)
because pikachus know how to drive (39:44 - 39:48)
pikachu would short out the engine (39:46 - 39:50)
not with that attitude yeah basically (39:48 - 39:53)
that attitude pikachu was uh (39:50 - 39:56)
a rock star he was a he was a luchador (39:53 - 39:59)
he was a mad scientist (39:56 - 40:01)
pikachu gets around they've had plenty (39:59 - 40:04)
of money anything that pikachu wishes (40:01 - 40:07)
don't stifle pikachu's dreams look i'm (40:04 - 40:08)
tired of pikachu (40:07 - 40:10)
dominating the conversation it's time (40:08 - 40:11)
for charizard (40:10 - 40:14)
to take over and drive a car i don't (40:11 - 40:16)
think we get anything other poke like i (40:14 - 40:17)
don't think we get like a detective (40:16 - 40:19)
pikachu or like a sleep i feel like they (40:17 - 40:21)
still save that for (40:19 - 40:24)
something else but i feel like the (40:21 - 40:25)
diamond pro fits here (40:24 - 40:29)
i think i'm going to profit too yeah (40:25 - 40:29)

dumb that's rhetorical and thinking that (42:47 - 42:53)
it's not just reggie elike and reggie (42:50 - 42:55)
drago (42:53 - 42:58)
um i think that's a reasonable (42:55 - 43:01)
consideration since they're saying this (42:58 - 43:02)
is discovery (43:01 - 43:04)
and those are two new pokemons does this (43:02 - 43:05)

no they like it though look film isn't (44:26 - 44:29)
free (44:29 - 44:32)
and neither is the kodak processing (44:29 - 44:36)
i'm not gonna spend money good lord (44:32 - 44:38)
distracted by something shiny it's still (44:36 - 44:40)
what take a snapshot of gret that's not (44:38 - 44:42)
happening give your body 10 tree techno (44:40 - 44:44)
a troubling situation pure this is the (44:42 - 44:46)
one that kills me purify or fire water (44:44 - 44:48)
or grass type shadow pokemon they (44:46 - 44:48)
haven't had (44:48 - 44:50)
a fire water or grass type shot of (44:48 - 44:52)
pokemon in four years (44:50 - 44:56)
they have a guarantee they have not not (44:52 - 44:57)
in my (44:56 - 45:00)
version of pokemon go maybe in yours (44:57 - 45:02)
i feel like all these complaints are i (45:00 - 45:05)
just don't want to play this game (45:02 - 45:08)
i don't want to play it the way that the (45:05 - 45:10)
man wants to force me to play (45:08 - 45:14)
i want to play it my way sending gifts (45:10 - 45:17)
and giving gifts (45:14 - 45:17)
if it is reggie if it is (45:18 - 45:24)
reggie ella key and reggie drago oh does (45:21 - 45:25)
that mean then i gotta take (45:24 - 45:28)
seven photos of electric pokemons and (45:25 - 45:30)
seven photos of dragon pokemons (45:28 - 45:34)
i i find those two to be very exciting (45:30 - 45:36)
because there's only one way to get them (45:34 - 45:38)
through the dlc and you can only get (45:36 - 45:40)
them once and you can only pick (45:38 - 45:42)
one of the two so being able to maybe (45:40 - 45:44)
get an extra (45:42 - 45:46)
two or three through raids that you can (45:44 - 45:48)
transfer through pokemon home because (45:46 - 45:49)
you're paying 16 (45:48 - 45:53)
a year for that uh feels exciting to me (45:49 - 45:56)
it doesn't i mean (45:53 - 45:58)
i feel like it's obvious but maybe it's (45:56 - 46:00)
not obvious (45:58 - 46:01)
that it would be those two because if it (46:00 - 46:03)
was like reggie rock reggie still regis (46:01 - 46:05)
and then reggie giggis it just (46:03 - 46:07)
why would i don't know maybe i'm (46:05 - 46:08)
overthinking it (46:07 - 46:10)
uh in addition to mega raids mega low (46:08 - 46:12)

japanese pokemon center and the english (49:30 - 49:34)
pokemon center (49:32 - 49:37)
so there is a lot of (49:34 - 49:39)
i don't know if we talk about this a lot (49:37 - 49:40)
in the show but i feel like there has (49:39 - 49:42)
been a lot of really good synergy (49:40 - 49:46)
in the last year with pokemon center (49:42 - 49:48)
pokemon go pokemon masters (49:46 - 49:51)
the anime not so much sword and shield (49:48 - 49:52)
sometimes sword and shield (49:51 - 49:55)
but at least those products have been (49:52 - 49:56)
really good at (49:55 - 50:01)
keeping things in (49:56 - 50:01)
what what's the word uh the word is just (50:01 - 50:05)
synergy i don't know harmony (50:04 - 50:08)
item harmony yeah they're all working (50:05 - 50:09)
together (50:08 - 50:11)
it was like when ash in the journeys (50:09 - 50:12)
anime got (50:11 - 50:15)
an egg oh this is maybe a spoiler look (50:12 - 50:17)
that episode came out a year ago you had (50:15 - 50:18)
time to watch it (50:17 - 50:20)
the egg hatches into a rio lou and in go (50:18 - 50:23)
that same week they boosted riolu (50:20 - 50:27)
in eggs um and (50:23 - 50:29)
there was some pokemon snap synergy with (50:27 - 50:31)
the raid bosses and (50:29 - 50:32)
some things that happened at the end of (50:31 - 50:35)
snap that was kind of cool (50:32 - 50:37)
so i feel like they've done a really (50:35 - 50:39)
good job of that recently (50:37 - 50:42)
um versus (50:39 - 50:45)
i know people always kind of like there (50:42 - 50:46)
was that there was that like uh (50:45 - 50:50)
pokemon direct where ishihara was (50:46 - 50:51)
talking and there was like an espionage (50:50 - 50:52)
umbreon (50:51 - 50:54)
behind him and then there was like the (50:52 - 50:56)
special edition let's go pikachu switch (50:54 - 50:57)
behind him (50:56 - 50:59)
and people like put two and two to get (50:57 - 51:01)
like oh that means less so go johto is (50:59 - 51:03)
coming like people do look for that kind (51:01 - 51:04)
of stuff (51:03 - 51:06)
but they they miss like the obvious (51:04 - 51:07)
stuff of like (51:06 - 51:10)
oh it's slowpoke week and pokemon go and (51:07 - 51:13)
pokemon center just put a 400 feet like (51:10 - 51:15)
that is that is like the thing that like (51:13 - 51:18)
that is what they are doing (51:15 - 51:19)
like they're not being subtle they're (51:18 - 51:24)
being very obvious about it (51:19 - 51:27)
i have a slobor related question okay i (51:24 - 51:28)
am the slowpoke master (51:27 - 51:30)
i have caught six in let's go and i (51:28 - 51:32)
defeated the (51:30 - 51:36)
other slow pokemaster for titles so yeah (51:32 - 51:39)
if you mega evolve (51:36 - 51:43)
gallerian slow bro (51:39 - 51:43)
what does does it just turn into regular (51:43 - 51:50)
mega what why not (51:46 - 51:51)
because it's it you can't make it (51:50 - 51:53)
because it's a gallerian it doesn't know (51:51 - 51:54)
how to mega (51:53 - 51:57)
but i guess it's a manga is infested by (51:54 - 52:00)
i gave it the mega stone to hold and (51:57 - 52:02)
according to genetics it's just a slow (52:00 - 52:04)
bro just like any other slow bro (52:02 - 52:08)
no according to the pokedex (52:04 - 52:10)
modified by the berries it was according (52:08 - 52:11)
to (52:10 - 52:13)
the pokedex it doesn't get a new pokedex (52:11 - 52:14)
number (52:13 - 52:17)
therefore according to science and the (52:14 - 52:19)
periodic table of the pokedex (52:17 - 52:22)
developments it should (52:19 - 52:25)
evolve into you can something you can (52:22 - 52:26)
giganta max (52:25 - 52:28)
a regular mouth but you cannot (52:26 - 52:30)
gigantomax meow meow meow (52:28 - 52:33)
a i am a (52:30 - 52:33)
a whole lot cause it's real (52:44 - 52:51)
it's real dumb looking it's (52:48 - 52:53)
nice i was at pokemon worlds when they (52:51 - 52:55)
revealed that thing and everybody was (52:53 - 52:56)
like (52:55 - 52:59)

seriously (52:59 - 53:03)
yeah they know what they're doing i was (53:00 - 53:05)
in the room where it happened (53:03 - 53:07)
the disappointment happened uh there is (53:05 - 53:08)
also a (53:07 - 53:11)

question mark which i think that means (53:24 - 53:26)
uh (53:26 - 53:29)
johto remakes because that was the rival (53:26 - 53:30)
question mark question mark question (53:29 - 53:33)
mark true correct uh trainers will be (53:30 - 53:35)
able to sync their (53:33 - 53:36)
i don't like reading this trainers will (53:35 - 53:38)

like b doof would have been a good (55:28 - 55:32)
candidate for community (55:29 - 55:32)
no because it only has two evolutions (55:33 - 55:36)
and that everybody knows (55:35 - 55:37)
we don't like community days that only (55:36 - 55:39)

magikarp was a community will come on (55:52 - 55:57)
and people were very unhappy because we (55:55 - 55:58)
already all had (55:57 - 56:00)
blue it was a community that was just (55:58 - 56:01)
two (56:00 - 56:03)
and nobody complained about suabloo (56:01 - 56:05)
community day oh people did (56:03 - 56:08)
everybody complains about everything uh (56:05 - 56:09)
yeah you're probably right it's probably (56:08 - 56:10)
b doof (56:09 - 56:11)

doofer it's peanut butter (56:11 - 56:16)
dufourino (56:13 - 56:16)
uh well we already talked about the (56:23 - 56:27)
giant slowpoke (56:25 - 56:29)
uh so i guess it's time now to talk (56:27 - 56:31)
about the pokey plush that captures (56:29 - 56:31)
joltik (56:31 - 56:34)
eating yamper's butt but it's is a is (56:31 - 56:36)
the booty eating gel tick (56:34 - 56:38)
this is operations now this is (56:36 - 56:40)
inappropriate content (56:38 - 56:44)
i want this so much this is off polygon (56:40 - 56:46)
the pokemon company toy maker (56:44 - 56:49)
tomy are finally capturing the purest (56:46 - 56:51)
essence of the pokemon joltek and yamper (56:49 - 56:53)
and toy form the new plush (56:51 - 56:55)
combines the two in a very particular (56:53 - 56:57)
way joltik is (56:55 - 56:59)
i'm going to change some words here uh (56:57 - 57:02)
joltik is feasting on yamper's butt (56:59 - 57:04)
uh the new plush will cost you six (57:02 - 57:06)
thousand yen (57:04 - 57:08)
uh it is more than a static stuffed (57:06 - 57:09)
animal it (57:08 - 57:12)
vibrates yep this pole toy you if you (57:09 - 57:14)
yoink on the joltik end of the tomy (57:12 - 57:16)
plush and the uh (57:14 - 57:18)
the attaching pokemon will scurry right (57:16 - 57:20)
up to yamper's booty (57:18 - 57:22)
uh where it will suck the electricity (57:20 - 57:24)
out of the puppy pokemon (57:22 - 57:26)
this of course is canon in the world of (57:24 - 57:28)
pokemon as noted in joltik's pokedex (57:26 - 57:30)
entry and pokemon shield (57:28 - 57:35)
joltik josek latch on to other pokemon (57:30 - 57:36)
and suck out the electricity (57:35 - 57:38)
they are often found sticking to (57:36 - 57:40)
yamper's hindquarters and quote (57:38 - 57:42)
previous pokedex entries for joltik are (57:40 - 57:44)
less graphic simply noting that the (57:42 - 57:45)
electric bug type pokemon sticks onto (57:44 - 57:47)
large bodies of pokemon (57:45 - 57:49)
and absorbs the static electricity (57:47 - 57:50)
storing it (57:49 - 57:54)
later in its pouch and (57:50 - 57:57)
if you go to the tomy site (57:54 - 58:01)
you can see the animation of joltik (57:57 - 58:04)
scooting up on yamper and clomping on (58:01 - 58:05)
them buns (58:04 - 58:08)
this would do very well in the world of (58:05 - 58:09)
tickle me elmo (58:08 - 58:12)
my browser felt the need to place (58:09 - 58:16)
a warning that the (58:12 - 58:20)
video of the uh joltik (58:16 - 58:23)
toy writes it could possibly be (58:20 - 58:27)
sensitive or inappropriate content (58:23 - 58:29)
i mean there is something sensitive or (58:27 - 58:31)
violent content (58:29 - 58:35)
tap to display it's so good (58:31 - 58:38)
i want this thing so bad first of all i (58:35 - 58:39)
love both those pokemon (58:38 - 58:41)
and second of all the animation of it (58:39 - 58:44)
scooting across and then scooping up (58:41 - 58:47)
yampers little buns it's the greatest (58:44 - 58:51)

answer okay (63:19 - 63:23)
i went to mitsuwa like two weeks ago (63:20 - 63:25)
it's a japanese marketplace (63:23 - 63:28)
um and they had hello kitty (63:25 - 63:31)
wine and they had three different (63:28 - 63:35)
types and they had little tags over them (63:31 - 63:37)
saying like this is not intended for (63:35 - 63:38)
children but it was like (63:37 - 63:41)
hello kitty like sparkling whatever and (63:38 - 63:43)
then hello kitty like red velvet (63:41 - 63:44)
sparkling and then like (63:43 - 63:46)
they had three like it was like a 40 or (63:44 - 63:48)
a 50 a dollar in like a 65 dollar (63:46 - 63:52)
bottle let's be honest and pokemon (63:48 - 63:54)
could do this no and get away with it (63:52 - 63:55)
fine (63:54 - 63:57)
apple yeah fellow kitty can do it they (63:55 - 63:58)
pikachu do it (63:57 - 64:02)
because in 2021 hello kitty is no longer (63:58 - 64:04)
none of hello kitty is for children (64:02 - 64:06)
she's a friend have you (64:04 - 64:09)

it hello kitty is no longer for children (64:22 - 64:26)
i mean there are aspects for children (64:25 - 64:28)

rpg company to work with pokemon to make (64:32 - 64:35)
an actual (64:34 - 64:39)
rpg i've got the real answer (64:35 - 64:42)
fracking no (64:39 - 64:42)
that was the joke answer the real answer (64:42 - 64:50)
is pet toys (64:46 - 64:53)

we'll skip number one because it (68:40 - 68:42)
literally had nothing to do with the (68:41 - 68:44)
actual pokemon of the week (68:42 - 68:47)
number two this week's pokemon has two (68:44 - 68:48)
forms (68:47 - 68:50)
one of which features either a (68:48 - 68:53)
wigglytuff or jigglypuff doll with its (68:50 - 68:56)
stuffing exposed (68:53 - 68:58)
number three another popular card (68:56 - 69:00)
introduced in 2012 this pokemon could (68:58 - 69:01)
potentially stop (69:00 - 69:04)
key components of opponent's decks from (69:01 - 69:04)
functioning (69:04 - 69:08)
but had to be used very carefully (69:04 - 69:08)
i the only other thing i could say is (69:09 - 69:15)
what what pokemon (69:12 - 69:18)
as part of the pokemon itself would (69:15 - 69:18)
feature (69:18 - 69:20)
something that somebody may say have (69:18 - 69:22)
thrown away (69:20 - 69:24)
i think i know when you said it stops (69:22 - 69:25)
other pokemon cards i i (69:24 - 69:28)
there's only two answers all right well (69:25 - 69:31)
who's that pokemon (69:28 - 69:31)
is (69:33 - 69:36)
it has a little like jigglypuff or (69:38 - 69:43)
wigglytuff doll stuck to it with the (69:41 - 69:44)
stuffing sticking out (69:43 - 69:48)
garbodor and vileplum have the (69:44 - 69:50)
same normally the same ability which is (69:48 - 69:51)
like shutting down supporters or (69:50 - 69:53)
shutting down abilities (69:51 - 69:56)
well i mean garbodor had garbo toxin (69:53 - 69:58)
specifically so if you had (69:56 - 70:04)
when did garbo get into the games (69:58 - 70:04)
some say your heart always knows what's (70:05 - 70:09)
right that's why the card was (70:07 - 70:12)
introduced in 2012 but yes if you had a (70:09 - 70:14)
tool card attached to garboda it shut (70:12 - 70:16)
down all abilities of all pokemon cards (70:14 - 70:19)
except for garbotoxin so you had to be (70:16 - 70:20)
careful (70:19 - 70:22)
because if you needed the ability of (70:20 - 70:24)
your one of your pokemons to go off you (70:22 - 70:26)
needed a tool (70:24 - 70:27)
i pronounce it scraper most people (70:26 - 70:29)
pronounce it scrapper (70:27 - 70:32)
to remove the tool from your garbodor oh (70:29 - 70:32)
so then (70:32 - 70:34)
you're on your turn you could have (70:32 - 70:35)
abilities and then return (70:34 - 70:37)
a tool to your garbodor so that your (70:35 - 70:39)
opponent could not have abilities (70:37 - 70:44)
the old tool scraper or scrapper (70:39 - 70:47)
garbodor shares similar traits to muck (70:44 - 70:48)
and wheezing all (70:47 - 70:50)
three are pure poison type pokemon with (70:48 - 70:52)
a single pre-evolved form (70:50 - 70:54)
roughly the same base stat totals and (70:52 - 70:55)
evolutions and appear (70:54 - 70:56)
to be based on different types of (70:55 - 70:58)
pollution garb order being (70:56 - 71:01)
land pollution and garb orders the only (70:58 - 71:04)
gen 5 pokemon to have a gigantomax (71:01 - 71:08)
form they're only one and gen 5 (71:04 - 71:14)
g's yeah (71:08 - 71:14)
whoever picks and chooses these things i (71:20 - 71:23)
need to talk (71:22 - 71:24)
honestly they need to include us in (71:23 - 71:27)
their meetings so that we can contribute (71:24 - 71:29)
some actual meaningful information (71:27 - 71:33)
so we can just go no bad james turner (71:29 - 71:37)
call us hmm true (71:33 - 71:39)

opinions on shinies shuffles shiny's (71:40 - 71:45)
good (71:44 - 71:49)
shiny is very good the is there oh (71:45 - 71:52)
i'm very torn on the shuffle icon (71:49 - 71:54)
i'm leaning more towards i really like (71:52 - 71:56)
it except it does look like he's just (71:54 - 71:57)
screaming into the air (71:56 - 72:00)
like somebody just stepped on his toe (71:57 - 72:03)
he's a vibe right there (72:00 - 72:03)
very vibey um well if uh if you made it (72:04 - 72:08)
to the end (72:07 - 72:10)
oh sorry we'll give us i have to get (72:08 - 72:11)
that they need a new pokemon (72:10 - 72:14)
to i'm sorry to complain about outside (72:11 - 72:16)
control (72:14 - 72:19)
this week i'm just distracted by this (72:16 - 72:19)
never-ending (72:19 - 72:23)
loop of a gif of a joltek sneaky (72:19 - 72:24)
[Music] (72:23 - 72:27)
yamper here all right this one is a (72:24 - 72:29)
gimme for greg because obviously he had (72:27 - 72:30)
so much trouble (72:29 - 72:32)
this past week so it's gonna be real (72:30 - 72:34)
easy for him (72:32 - 72:36)
i was recently in philadelphia with (72:34 - 72:39)
acclaimed podcast host and author greg (72:36 - 72:40)
leatherman (72:39 - 72:43)
on the occasion of his birth anniversary (72:40 - 72:44)
as we were passing the hours in the (72:43 - 72:46)
asian-themed section of the city of (72:44 - 72:48)
brotherly love (72:46 - 72:50)
we happened upon a store named asia (72:48 - 72:52)
crafts (72:50 - 72:54)
this store featured many pokemon and (72:52 - 72:57)
sanrio licensed properties (72:54 - 72:59)
of which i purchased two as gifts to (72:57 - 73:02)
honor greg's special day (72:59 - 73:03)
i also bought him dinner and dessert (73:02 - 73:05)
later that yeah (73:03 - 73:08)
one of the gifts was an alolan vulpix (73:05 - 73:11)
which he had previously held fondly as (73:08 - 73:13)
we browsed the market (73:11 - 73:16)
the other gift was a pin featuring (73:13 - 73:17)
greg's favorite (73:16 - 73:22)
and my second favorite sanrio character (73:17 - 73:24)
this week's pokemon is derived from that (73:22 - 73:26)
character (73:24 - 73:28)
you can figure it out if you rearrange (73:26 - 73:30)
the letters properly (73:28 - 73:32)
you may have to remove the c and the d (73:30 - 73:33)
though (73:32 - 73:37)
and by c i mean like on the moon (73:33 - 73:40)
or around italy (73:37 - 73:42)
