bu what's up everyone welcome to the 591 (0:21 - 0:27)
episode of the Pokémon podcast it's (0:25 - 0:30)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:27 - 0:33)
me is Hannah I am here I am getting (0:30 - 0:35)
really really worried about being able (0:33 - 0:36)
to get my seasonal Master Ball in (0:35 - 0:42)
Pokémon go I still have 39 raids I need (0:36 - 0:46)
to do and I have I think what seven days (0:42 - 0:48)
eight days you can do it I believe in (0:46 - 0:51)
you so you're saying you didn't go hard (0:48 - 0:54)
on Mega Garchomp day I did not it was (0:51 - 0:57)
rainy I got help from people in the (0:54 - 1:01)
slack and was very very grateful um but (0:57 - 1:03)
I only did enough to get the energy to (1:01 - 1:06)
Mega Evolve got (1:03 - 1:10)
it Greg do you also have 3,000 meag gar (1:06 - 1:14)
chomp energy like me oh you you I did (1:10 - 1:18)
nothing but Chomp yesterday I was I (1:14 - 1:21)
chomped from one side of this (1:18 - 1:24)
town to the other it was just like a (1:21 - 1:27)
pacman running through (1:24 - 1:31)
Minneapolis perfect what I did you did (1:27 - 1:32)
the right thing and not went to Mall of (1:31 - 1:36)
America because it was ungodly busy for (1:32 - 1:38)
some reason (1:36 - 1:41)
uh it's because it's before the holidays (1:38 - 1:44)
and people were out running every errand (1:41 - 1:46)
they possibly could in prep for the (1:44 - 1:50)
holiday already oh yeah so like if you (1:46 - 1:52)
don't have a guest table and chairs (1:50 - 1:54)
you're not going to do it the week of (1:52 - 1:57)
Thanksgiving you're going to do it (1:54 - 1:58)
now that's the (1:57 - 2:01)
problem to wear (1:58 - 2:04)
Thanksgiving for (2:01 - 2:09)
reasons cuz that's what people (2:04 - 2:09)
do are you are you a friends given (2:10 - 2:15)
person (2:12 - 2:15)
Greg if my entire family wasn't here yes (2:16 - 2:26)
however my entire family is here all of (2:22 - 2:30)
my in-laws and my immediate family my my (2:26 - 2:33)
brother his family and my parents so as (2:30 - 2:37)
much as I would like to maybe not spend (2:33 - 2:39)
time with my family on a holiday that is (2:37 - 2:41)
not an option I thought friends giving (2:39 - 2:45)
is like the week before no it can be it (2:41 - 2:47)
can be but generally friendsgiving is (2:45 - 2:51)
for people who are have nowhere else to (2:47 - 2:54)
go on a Thanksgiving holiday so they (2:51 - 2:55)
gather (2:54 - 2:57)
together (2:55 - 3:00)
um but like I'm not celebrating than (2:57 - 3:02)
Thanksgiving twice that's like it's not (3:00 - 3:03)
even that big of a h it's not that (3:02 - 3:05)
important of a holiday you want turkey (3:03 - 3:08)
twice I mean I like turkey and I would (3:05 - 3:11)
make turkey twice but like there's a lot (3:08 - 3:13)
more that goes into that than just (3:11 - 3:15)
making a (3:13 - 3:17)
turkey hey there are restaurants that (3:15 - 3:18)
you can order a (3:17 - 3:21)
whole Thanksgiving meal from yep if you (3:18 - 3:25)
sure can and my mother is I believe this (3:21 - 3:28)
year deciding (3:25 - 3:31)
that's well speaking of it makes you (3:28 - 3:35)
sleepy and it is week 11 of us maybe 12 (3:31 - 3:39)
true of us playing Pokemon (3:35 - 3:43)
sleep that was an okay transition what I (3:39 - 3:44)
if it was true but turkey doesn't make (3:43 - 3:46)
you sleepy I thought that's what (3:44 - 3:49)
everyone says no they're wrong oh okay (3:46 - 3:50)
it's what everybody says but they're (3:49 - 3:54)
wrong doesn't pretzels make you (3:50 - 3:54)
sleepy I think it's just the filling (3:55 - 4:00)
food part it's just the carb over load (3:58 - 4:02)
part for Thanksgiving that makes you (4:00 - 4:05)
tired but also which type of pretzels (4:02 - 4:07)
soft pretzels or crispy pretzels oh I (4:05 - 4:10)
don't know you can't bring up scientific (4:07 - 4:12)
literature if you didn't read (4:10 - 4:15)
it pistachios make you sleepy pistachios (4:12 - 4:19)
have naturom melatonin oh okay okay uh (4:15 - 4:20)
well (4:19 - 4:24)
um it is it is wild to me that we're (4:20 - 4:27)
three months maybe oh Google thank you (4:24 - 4:30)
for helping me four months Pokemon sleep (4:27 - 4:32)
and it has more news than any other (4:30 - 4:34)
video game happening any other Pokemon (4:32 - 4:37)
game at least there's uh sleep news here (4:34 - 4:38)
so we'll we'll just get that out of the (4:37 - 4:40)
way first bit of news is Onyx and (4:38 - 4:44)
Steelix are appearing in Pokemon sleep (4:40 - 4:46)
uh they will be in the how do you say (4:44 - 4:52)
this to top top top Hollow Tope top (4:46 - 4:54)
Hollow I think top Hollow I mean is it (4:52 - 4:56)
isn't it supposed to be based off the (4:54 - 4:58)
color which means it's taupe yeah that's (4:56 - 5:01)
what I thought yeah that yeah top Tope (4:58 - 5:07)
um that will start on the 14th of (5:01 - 5:10)
November uh I think most hardcore (5:07 - 5:12)
Pokemon sleep players like refuse to (5:10 - 5:15)
leave greenlands or the beach those are (5:12 - 5:17)
like the two most popular places because (5:15 - 5:21)
it's good berries good Pokemon (5:17 - 5:24)
spawns like no one wants Geodude (5:21 - 5:27)
anyways there's so much more than just (5:24 - 5:30)
Geodude there no one wants Riolu cuz (5:27 - 5:32)
that's also bad you get all of the (5:30 - 5:34)
Jigglypuff in (5:32 - 5:36)
topollo oh that's good that's good I (5:34 - 5:38)
already got a 99 out of 100 Jigglypuff (5:36 - 5:40)
or whatever some apparently pretzels do (5:38 - 5:42)
make you sleepy or can make you sleepy (5:40 - 5:46)
is the soft ones or the hard ones it (5:42 - 5:49)
it it seems to suggest that it is the (5:46 - 5:52)
soft ones it says the staple ballpark (5:49 - 5:54)
snack and the one that that ballparks (5:52 - 5:55)
are (5:54 - 5:58)
soft uh they're a source of carbs (5:55 - 6:00)
because carbs can make you sleepy (5:58 - 6:03)
but they have a lot of magnesium in them (6:00 - 6:06)
which is needed for Quality site so it (6:03 - 6:09)
helps prevent magnesium deficiency which (6:06 - 6:13)
is known to make it harder to stay (6:09 - 6:15)
asleep is this (6:13 - 6:19)
accurate sounds like typ of magnesium (6:15 - 6:22)
milk (6:19 - 6:22)
yeah anyways back to topollo and the (6:22 - 6:28)
wonderful creatures you can find there (6:25 - 6:30)
all of which are valid and vital for (6:28 - 6:33)
your sleep experience if you wish to (6:30 - 6:38)
have a Riolu on your team go for it no (6:33 - 6:41)
Max in this game it's going to reset in (6:38 - 6:43)
a week anyways invite your little (6:41 - 6:45)
friends to spend the night with you who (6:43 - 6:48)
cares is it's your life there absolutely (6:45 - 6:51)
is mid maxing in this game oh (6:48 - 6:52)
yeah (6:51 - 6:56)
no no I'm I'm punching Pokemon in the (6:52 - 6:58)
calculator left and (6:56 - 7:01)
right um okay so Onyx and Cela are (6:58 - 7:03)
coming to the game uh there's also an (7:01 - 7:07)
Eevee event uh Eevee week 2023 will (7:03 - 7:09)
begin at 4: a on November 20th so not (7:07 - 7:11)
this week that well assuming you're (7:09 - 7:13)
listening to this podcast the week of (7:11 - 7:17)
the 13th the following week uh it's to (7:13 - 7:19)
this this event is to celebrate Eevee (7:17 - 7:22)
day which is November 21st during which (7:19 - 7:24)
Eevee and its Evolutions are more likely (7:22 - 7:26)
to gather for sleep you'll be able to (7:24 - 7:28)
encounter different Pokemon of different (7:26 - 7:31)
sleep types regardless of your own and (7:28 - 7:32)
Eevee and its Evolutions are more likely (7:31 - 7:35)
to appear and if you're lucky you might (7:32 - 7:37)
even meet a shiny Eevee it didn't say if (7:35 - 7:40)
you're lucky trainers so Niantic didn't (7:37 - 7:42)
write (7:40 - 7:45)
this but are you trainers in this yeah (7:42 - 7:47)
not really a trainer I think you're (7:45 - 7:51)
researchers yeah if you're lucky (7:47 - 7:53)
researchers uh also if you can uh (7:51 - 7:55)
conduct sleep research on Eevee day (7:53 - 7:58)
which is November 21st you can get (7:55 - 8:01)
1,121 bonus sleep points you can get a (7:58 - 8:03)
nice reward like an Eevee incense (8:01 - 8:05)
through special missions which will be (8:03 - 8:07)
available in addition to the usual (8:05 - 8:09)
missions and during Eevee week all your (8:07 - 8:11)
helper Pokemon's main skills will have a (8:09 - 8:13)
higher chance of being triggered we hope (8:11 - 8:15)
you enjoy this great work from your (8:13 - 8:16)
helper (8:15 - 8:18)
Pokemon (8:16 - 8:21)
um and it doesn't say that you have to (8:18 - 8:25)
sleep specifically (8:21 - 8:28)
anywhere so that's (8:25 - 8:31)
nice you can stay in Topo and keep (8:28 - 8:33)
looking for that Steelix while also (8:31 - 8:37)
enjoying the Eevee event heck yeah (8:33 - 8:39)
yeah uh (8:37 - 8:42)
so this we we'll Circle back here (8:39 - 8:44)
because this leads into some other (8:42 - 8:47)
Pokemon news which is uh there's an (8:44 - 8:51)
Eevee event in (8:47 - 8:54)
Pao uh which is the penny and Sylveon (8:51 - 8:58)
arrive in Masters ex get ready for this (8:54 - 9:01)
festiv (8:58 - 9:04)
Fest it's supposed to be festive festies (9:01 - 9:07)
festivities it's not (9:04 - 9:09)
good puns are (9:07 - 9:12)
bad trainers are all all over are (9:09 - 9:13)
gathering to show their love for (9:12 - 9:15)
evolution Pokemon by showcasing their (9:13 - 9:18)
partner Eevee and its of all forms uh (9:15 - 9:20)
there is one Eevee Super Fan from Pala (9:18 - 9:22)
who is a bit shy to get in on the fun (9:20 - 9:24)
though Penny who loves all things Eevee (9:22 - 9:26)
but is also nervous about meeting new (9:24 - 9:28)
people face to face uh AKA most people (9:26 - 9:30)
listening this podcast (9:28 - 9:33)
uh even though she is committed mostly (9:30 - 9:35)
me even though she's committed to try to (9:33 - 9:36)
become a new version of herself on a (9:35 - 9:41)
unique island of passio uh and her SN (9:36 - 9:43)
pair is (9:41 - 9:43)
sylveon which I guess (9:44 - 9:49)
like Valerie's sink pair should probably (9:46 - 9:52)
be Sylveon because she was the first gym (9:49 - 9:55)
leader to have Sylveon but Valerie s (9:52 - 9:59)
pair is syon oh wait is Valerie in the (9:55 - 10:02)
game yeah twice oh yeah has been for a (9:59 - 10:04)
long time been for for a chunk I don't (10:02 - 10:08)
think I've ever pulled her oh yeah she's (10:04 - 10:10)
there (10:08 - 10:10)
also Penny's voice is threw me for a (10:12 - 10:17)
loop we had this conversation before we (10:15 - 10:20)
started the show I'm having it now she's (10:17 - 10:23)
got a slightly she got a slight British (10:20 - 10:25)
accent which is fine but her voice is (10:23 - 10:29)
softer than I probably expected it to be (10:25 - 10:31)
yeah her British accent makes sense (10:29 - 10:34)
because she's from Galler but I would (10:31 - 10:37)
describe her voice as fluffy maybe sword (10:34 - 10:39)
Shi remix confirmed she's from Galler (10:37 - 10:41)
we're going to Galler because it's (10:39 - 10:43)
really because because Spain is really (10:41 - 10:45)
close that's this is what all the we're (10:43 - 10:46)
going back to Galler then right no it (10:45 - 10:48)
already we already know we're going back (10:46 - 10:50)
to Unova they already said it's Unova we (10:48 - 10:54)
already know what about Callos everyone (10:50 - 10:57)
told me we're going back to Callos we (10:54 - 11:00)
have Callos people in m (10:57 - 11:03)
I'm pretty sure yes so Ma so playing (11:00 - 11:06)
Pokemon Masters Callos confirmed for (11:03 - 11:09)
scarlet and violet okay Callos Callos is (11:06 - 11:11)
confirmed as a region that exists near (11:09 - 11:13)
these other regions got it all right (11:11 - 11:16)
thanks for clearing that up no problem (11:13 - 11:19)
uh yeah so in the comments comment (11:16 - 11:23)
about whether you like her voice neon's (11:19 - 11:27)
voice neon's voice is on point solid I (11:23 - 11:29)
am not sold on Penny's voice yet I'll (11:27 - 11:32)
get there it just felt weird I was (11:29 - 11:35)
expecting much more of a hybrid Spanish (11:32 - 11:36)
English type (11:35 - 11:39)
thing it's just pure fluffy English (11:36 - 11:42)
which is fine it just just feels (11:39 - 11:44)
weird I don't know I don't think she (11:42 - 11:46)
spent that much time in (11:44 - 11:50)
Pala enough to get kicked out wait who (11:46 - 11:51)
got kicked (11:50 - 11:56)
out Benny wait she went to Pala got (11:51 - 11:58)
kicked out and then came back (11:56 - 12:01)
yeah (11:58 - 12:05)
what main story line the main story (12:01 - 12:07)
line wait when did she come back wa how (12:05 - 12:09)
did she get kicked out to begin with did (12:07 - 12:11)
she just never graduate she caused the (12:09 - 12:14)
uprise did you not pay attention to this (12:11 - 12:16)
game no did she she doesn't get kicked (12:14 - 12:19)
out so she got kicked out before then (12:16 - 12:23)
before our character comes (12:19 - 12:23)
yes no I don't remember that (12:23 - 12:27)
part I just remember her like hacking (12:28 - 12:34)
into the thing at the end and then it (12:32 - 12:36)
was like I'll hack my records to be good (12:34 - 12:38)
or (12:36 - 12:38)
something I don't remember her (12:39 - 12:42)
specifically getting kicked out but it (12:41 - 12:45)
was definitely at least something like (12:42 - 12:48)
that yeah she got kicked (12:45 - 12:51)
out she got kicked out because she (12:48 - 12:54)
decided to leave because she organized (12:51 - 12:55)
everybody did not be bullies and then (12:54 - 12:58)
she went back to Galler to spend a year (12:55 - 13:01)
away and then she sneaks back not really (12:58 - 13:03)
sneaks back cuz you run into her but she (13:01 - 13:06)
comes back from being away for the year (13:03 - 13:07)
uh and then is hacking the system to (13:06 - 13:10)
make up for the problems that she caused (13:07 - 13:11)
by (13:10 - 13:14)
forming team star and letting them loose (13:11 - 13:19)
upon the universe or whatever oh okay uh (13:14 - 13:21)
because she's part of the stem program (13:19 - 13:23)
and then you know the whole thing it's (13:21 - 13:25)
the whole thing but yes she gets kicked (13:23 - 13:28)
out and then comes (13:25 - 13:28)
back (13:28 - 13:32)
uh so anyways we have uh the Pokemon (13:30 - 13:34)
sleep Eevee event we have the Pokemon (13:32 - 13:37)
Masters Eevee event uh we've been doing (13:34 - 13:39)
the show for a (13:37 - 13:41)
decade (13:39 - 13:44)
uh and I feel like the last couple years (13:41 - 13:46)
we haven't really talked about a (13:44 - 13:49)
specific Eevee day but that's a thing uh (13:46 - 13:52)
if don't didn't know that uh the (13:49 - 13:54)
farthest I could go back was finding (13:52 - 13:58)
that the EV day was official as of (13:54 - 14:00)
2018 yeah that's what (13:58 - 14:03)
I so I could (14:00 - 14:05)
have so I couldn't find anything before (14:03 - 14:08)
that but apparently on uh (14:05 - 14:13)
2018 November 21st 2018 was the first (14:08 - 14:16)
ever eveve day becoming official uh I (14:13 - 14:19)
did go back look we could spend the next (14:16 - 14:21)
hour going back of old Eevee Day events (14:19 - 14:22)
there there has been a lot like Masters (14:21 - 14:24)
has pretty much done something Eevee (14:22 - 14:28)
related every year (14:24 - 14:32)
um I maybe that's why the EV outbreaks (14:28 - 14:34)
were not outbreaks the EV raids were (14:32 - 14:36)
like one of the first raids in scarlet (14:34 - 14:39)
and violet it was kind of close but I (14:36 - 14:41)
guess I didn't put that together but you (14:39 - 14:43)
could maybe may maybe stretch and make (14:41 - 14:45)
an argument for that but there's been a (14:43 - 14:46)
lot of Eevee stuff there was like a (14:45 - 14:49)
whole Eevee dedicated Twitter account (14:46 - 14:52)
that people thought meant that new EES (14:49 - 14:56)
were coming no it just eeve is very (14:52 - 15:03)
popular surprise surprise e popular um (14:56 - 15:05)
so with that being said we have a (15:03 - 15:07)
Pokemon sleep Eevee event coming we have (15:05 - 15:10)
a Pokemon Masters Eevee event coming I'm (15:07 - 15:11)
going to assume that there's going to be (15:10 - 15:14)
a scarlet and event scarlet and violet (15:11 - 15:17)
Eevee event coming whether that's just (15:14 - 15:20)
recycling the raids that we've already (15:17 - 15:22)
seen uh it's been a year so it's really (15:20 - 15:25)
easy for them to be like okay well you (15:22 - 15:26)
had to have the game within like the (15:25 - 15:28)
what the first month in order to do this (15:26 - 15:30)
e (15:28 - 15:34)
so I could see I remember them it (15:30 - 15:39)
was it was just five star no it wasn't (15:34 - 15:40)
even five star Eevees I think they could (15:39 - 15:43)
be in three four and five yeah they (15:40 - 15:45)
could just be random terot types barely (15:43 - 15:48)
remember it was a thing I can't remember (15:45 - 15:50)
if that was before or after Charizard I (15:48 - 15:51)
think it was before I think it was the (15:50 - 15:53)
very first event and then Charizard was (15:51 - 15:55)
the second (15:53 - 15:55)
event that sounds about right I know (15:56 - 16:01)
that it wasn't one I was interested in (15:58 - 16:02)
because it was just the EES with (16:01 - 16:04)
different terot types I remember (16:02 - 16:07)
catching one of each and then being like (16:04 - 16:09)
this might matter and then I think I Ed (16:07 - 16:11)
like one of them for something it was (16:09 - 16:14)
before everybody figured out how easily (16:11 - 16:16)
you quote unquote easily you can change (16:14 - 16:18)
a terot type I think oh yeah because I (16:16 - 16:20)
think at that point it wasn't revealed (16:18 - 16:22)
that you could change a terot type (16:20 - 16:23)
because on the show we were talking (16:22 - 16:26)
about like how easy or hard are they (16:23 - 16:27)
going to make (16:26 - 16:30)
this for yeah Terra (16:27 - 16:32)
Pokemon um so yeah I I expect them to (16:30 - 16:34)
announce something for scarlet and (16:32 - 16:36)
violet and something for Pokemon go I (16:34 - 16:38)
don't think as of this recording (16:36 - 16:42)
anything for go has been announced Eevee (16:38 - 16:46)
related no uh now that there are now (16:42 - 16:48)
that there has been two Mass outbreak (16:46 - 16:50)
events it would be cool to see like an (16:48 - 16:54)
Eevee Mass outbreak I have played this (16:50 - 16:56)
game every day for a full year and I (16:54 - 16:58)
don't think I've ever seen an Eevee (16:56 - 17:01)
outbreak I've seen a vaporean outbreak (16:58 - 17:01)
one (17:01 - 17:04)
time that was cool but I didn't do it (17:01 - 17:08)
but I saw it and I was like look at them (17:04 - 17:12)
Vaporeon look at them look at them (17:08 - 17:17)
go vaporing Vapor man's on its way Vapor (17:12 - 17:19)
I think I think Hannah said this a (17:17 - 17:22)
couple episodes ago but as much as I (17:19 - 17:24)
liked I think this is what you said (17:22 - 17:25)
Hannah you can correct me as much as I (17:24 - 17:27)
lik the Halloween event I liked the (17:25 - 17:29)
Clefairy event more cuz it felt like a (17:27 - 17:31)
Community Day (17:29 - 17:34)
mhm oh yeah no when I was when the (17:31 - 17:36)
Clefairy event was happening everybody (17:34 - 17:38)
was posting photos of their shiny (17:36 - 17:40)
Clefairy and it absolutely felt like a (17:38 - 17:41)
community (17:40 - 17:45)
day but the ghosts was just everybody (17:41 - 17:47)
was getting different ones it wasn't (17:45 - 17:48)
quite the (17:47 - 17:51)
same yeah it's like not the worst thing (17:48 - 17:53)
ever it was just kind of cool (17:51 - 17:55)
to kind of have that (17:53 - 17:58)
moment of like everyone kind of shiny (17:55 - 17:59)
hunting the same Pokemon in posting that (17:58 - 18:01)
I obviously shiny hunting isn't like the (17:59 - 18:03)
biggest thing in the world when it comes (18:01 - 18:05)
to Pokemon like shiny hunting is still (18:03 - 18:06)
very Niche obviously if you're listening (18:05 - 18:07)
to this podcast you're like what are you (18:06 - 18:09)
talking about you're listening to a (18:07 - 18:11)
Pokemon podcast you are already more (18:09 - 18:15)
hardcore than the average Pokemon (18:11 - 18:15)
fan but Eevee is g to be one that people (18:15 - 18:21)
are if it if if it does have an outbreak (18:18 - 18:23)
event Eevee would be a very exciting one (18:21 - 18:26)
people would love to shiny hunt that oh (18:23 - 18:28)
yeah I'm like when you think about like (18:26 - 18:30)
Pokemon that bring people back to the (18:28 - 18:32)
game like it was (18:30 - 18:36)
undoubtedly like Greninja was so popular (18:32 - 18:38)
so many people came back for Greninja um (18:36 - 18:43)
Mewtwo was like insanely popular uh and (18:38 - 18:45)
you just saw people talking about like (18:43 - 18:48)
wanting to get it too hard too easy like (18:45 - 18:50)
need help like I just want to get this (18:48 - 18:52)
Mewtwo uh I would I would assume (18:50 - 18:55)
anything eveve related outbreak wise (18:52 - 18:58)
would would be huge for people to come (18:55 - 19:00)
back and like eeve is a cool one too (18:58 - 19:02)
because like with Clefairy it's like (19:00 - 19:05)
well I got two I guess I keep one as (19:02 - 19:06)
Clefairy and then I evolve one to (19:05 - 19:09)
clefable but with Eevee it's like I want (19:06 - 19:11)
to get all (19:09 - 19:15)
18 so I could have every terot type and (19:11 - 19:18)
then get another nine time what wait (19:15 - 19:21)
what is hold on how many Eevees could (19:18 - 19:25)
you get of every terot type so (19:21 - 19:29)
many you have one of every ter type that (19:25 - 19:31)
you can evolve into one of every (19:29 - 19:33)
evolution yeah that would be so many I (19:31 - 19:35)
was I was sitting here thinking that (19:33 - 19:37)
Eevee doesn't have hats in Pokemon go so (19:35 - 19:38)
you don't need as many shinies as you (19:37 - 19:41)
need in Pokemon go but it does have hats (19:38 - 19:45)
it has the Tera hats yeah yeah it's like (19:41 - 19:47)
what (19:45 - 19:52)
162 Eevees so you did 162 shiny Eevee (19:47 - 19:56)
yeah that would be easy one weekend (19:52 - 19:58)
you're done that would be a a cool (19:56 - 20:00)
challenge (19:58 - 20:02)
was this uh 2018 was that let's go (20:00 - 20:04)
Pikachu let's go Eevee I think that was (20:02 - 20:07)
the same year yep (20:04 - 20:10)
yeah was it it was it was I know that (20:07 - 20:14)
for sure yeah yeah man that was a good (20:10 - 20:18)
game it's okay it was (20:14 - 20:20)
Kanto yeah but the ekins had a really (20:18 - 20:22)
good follow animation compared to that (20:20 - 20:26)
theyve never replicated (20:22 - 20:26)
since um November 16 2018 let's go (20:26 - 20:34)
Pikachu let's go (20:31 - 20:34)
Eevee uh I don't actually know if there (20:34 - 20:40)
was anything Eevee related for Cafe mix (20:37 - 20:42)
uh I think there's like a pho event (20:40 - 20:44)
happening in Cafe mix right now (20:42 - 20:48)
yeah uh speaking of Pho there's a pho (20:44 - 20:51)
event in South Korea right now I didn't (20:48 - 20:53)
put this on the the show notes (20:51 - 20:56)
but uh their department store in South (20:53 - 20:59)
Korea which is called I think lot latte (20:56 - 21:02)
I think it's lot um they'll have little (20:59 - 21:05)
kiosks for scarlet and violet to promote (21:02 - 21:08)
the what what is the DLC I don't want (21:05 - 21:11)
it's not the double pack it's the DLC (21:08 - 21:13)
pack or whatever it's the physical (21:11 - 21:16)
version with the physical DLC minus half (21:13 - 21:20)
the DLC isn't on the cartridge yeah for (21:16 - 21:22)
you know reasons for (21:20 - 21:27)
reasons because bad timing yeah you if (21:22 - 21:30)
they gonna try to (21:27 - 21:30)
try to put one out that has both like (21:30 - 21:36)
right before (21:34 - 21:39)
Christmas if they if they were to put an (21:36 - 21:42)
updated retail version that had both on (21:39 - 21:44)
I would consider buying it for (21:42 - 21:47)
collecting purposes but right now it's (21:44 - 21:49)
worthless eventually they'll probably (21:47 - 21:52)
update it I feel like over time if (21:49 - 21:54)
something keeps being on shelves they (21:52 - 21:55)
put in the (21:54 - 21:58)
updates yeah um but anyways if you're in (21:55 - 22:00)
South Korea you can go into the the low (21:58 - 22:02)
department store find the kiosk there (22:00 - 22:04)
should be a little Pho it's like a level (22:02 - 22:06)
five pho in a cherish ball uh and then (22:04 - 22:08)
it comes with a Mark I don't remember (22:06 - 22:12)
which mark it is but um to people who (22:08 - 22:14)
like to collect cherish ball Pokemon so (22:12 - 22:16)
they're not selling phos shaped (22:14 - 22:19)
bread I mean are they did I miss this (22:16 - 22:22)

check Delta real quick let me get some (22:35 - 22:39)
Pho bread that sounds (22:37 - 22:41)
awesome uh I think that's it I think (22:39 - 22:46)
that's all we have for Eevee so um well (22:41 - 22:48)
I guess when we get closer to happy (22:46 - 22:49)
Eevee (22:48 - 22:53)
day we can say happy Eevee (22:49 - 22:53)
day uh okay well let's uh take a break (22:53 - 22:59)
and when we come back we'll have some (22:57 - 23:01)
more Pokémon news so we will be right (22:59 - 23:07)
back and we are back from our break (23:01 - 23:10)
uh before we get to the the longer (23:07 - 23:12)
conversation of this episode which (23:10 - 23:15)
revolves around money uh just a quick (23:12 - 23:18)
heads up the sitting cuties have been (23:15 - 23:21)
restocked at Pokemon (23:18 - 23:24)
Center that there's your breaking news (23:21 - 23:27)
new also involving money they're twice (23:24 - 23:29)
the price that they used to aren't (23:27 - 23:32)
they some of them went up at one point (23:29 - 23:33)
they were all like 12 bucks now some of (23:32 - 23:37)
them are like pushing 14 $15 I thought (23:33 - 23:40)
they were 20 something (23:37 - 23:43)
what Maybe I'm Wrong that would be the (23:40 - 23:45)
real breaking (23:43 - 23:48)
news no some some were more expensive (23:45 - 23:50)
the more complicated ones like I think (23:48 - 23:52)
salamance was a little bit way like it (23:50 - 23:54)
was like $3 more than shell gon was but (23:52 - 23:56)
like why are you buying salamance shell (23:54 - 23:58)
gon is the better like shgon is is (23:56 - 24:00)
literally just a ball with eyes like (23:58 - 24:03)
that's the one you should (24:00 - 24:03)
purchase yeah there's some $ 122 there (24:03 - 24:08)
are some that are (24:06 - 24:12)
18 18 for a sitting cutie (24:08 - 24:17)
17 $17 I don't I think 17 makes it (24:12 - 24:21)
better no there's uh whoever from the (24:17 - 24:22)
Pokemon company who listens to the (24:21 - 24:24)
podcast I know you do uh the do you (24:22 - 24:27)
remember the moomo milk wooden thing (24:24 - 24:29)
that came out for Christmas like three (24:27 - 24:33)
years ago was $20 I have it it it's kind (24:29 - 24:33)
of (24:33 - 24:36)
like slightly tacky like I don't know (24:33 - 24:38)
where in the house I would put it where (24:36 - 24:39)
it would make sense so people be like oh (24:38 - 24:44)
the kitchen but it's like H sure um they (24:39 - 24:46)
did new ones this year there's like a (24:44 - 24:48)
pseudo woodo one yeah and then there's (24:46 - 24:51)
another one when I bought the mil tank (24:48 - 24:54)
one it was 20 bucks which is like yeah (24:51 - 24:56)
sure whatever something to put on the (24:54 - 24:59)
wall 20 bucks the the pseudo woodo one (24:56 - 25:01)
and whatever the other one is is (24:59 - 25:04)
$40 inflation and when and if you (25:01 - 25:05)
compare the two together like pull up (25:04 - 25:08)
both Pages it's the same it's the same (25:05 - 25:11)
dimensions it's the same material it is (25:08 - 25:14)
it is literally double the price and (25:11 - 25:19)
it's insane to me because I I think the (25:14 - 25:22)
mum milk one is the best one because I (25:19 - 25:24)
don't cuz you could have it up all year (25:22 - 25:26)
long cuz it's just like get your milk (25:24 - 25:27)
and you're like oh look it's in the (25:26 - 25:29)
kitchen or maybe you have like a weird (25:27 - 25:31)
like milk themed bathroom actually (25:29 - 25:33)
that's not weird that's awesome if you (25:31 - 25:34)
have a milk themed bathroom that sounds (25:33 - 25:36)
great actually weird it's (25:34 - 25:40)
weird no but also awesome don't let (25:36 - 25:42)
these two discourage your milk themed (25:40 - 25:47)
dreams listener what wait was the moomo (25:42 - 25:49)
milk thing a wooden sign or was that a (25:47 - 25:52)
tray no it was a sign it was a sign it's (25:49 - 25:54)
the same as the pseudo Widow okay they (25:52 - 25:55)
did have they did they did have like a (25:54 - 25:59)
Mumu milk bottle and plate collection (25:55 - 26:02)
which at the time was only $15 and that (25:59 - 26:05)
sold out like instantly also they were (26:02 - 26:07)
not dishwasher safe I learned the hard (26:05 - 26:09)
way on (26:07 - 26:13)
that they were also not cat food safe (26:09 - 26:16)
like I put wet cat food on it oh and it (26:13 - 26:21)
like the cat food ate away at the the (26:16 - 26:22)
the (26:21 - 26:26)
design sounds like com food safe yeah no (26:22 - 26:28)
I don't think they were food safe at all (26:26 - 26:30)
all right I'm looking bought two at the (26:28 - 26:31)
time hold (26:30 - 26:36)
on oh man sold (26:31 - 26:40)
out oh yeah mum milk Pokemon holiday and (26:36 - 26:42)
home sign (26:40 - 26:44)
1999 (26:42 - 26:48)
yep and the pseudo wiow one is 40 $ (26:44 - 26:51)
39.99 I under I understand inflation I (26:48 - 26:53)
understand everything is expensive I (26:51 - 26:54)
also understand that I don't think the (26:53 - 26:56)
Pokemon company is specifically on the (26:54 - 26:58)
merchant side side of things things is (26:56 - 27:01)
hurting for money but also like if it (26:58 - 27:04)
was like 25 and not 20 it' be like ah (27:01 - 27:08)
yeah yeah 25% increase inflation (27:04 - 27:12)
double from 20 to 40 is outrageous but (27:08 - 27:14)
the back is different (27:12 - 27:17)
though but why does that matter it goes (27:14 - 27:19)
on the wall but the back is different (27:17 - 27:23)
though could be a stronger back it's see (27:19 - 27:26)
the back it so the back in the other one (27:23 - 27:28)
says Pokemon made in China (27:26 - 27:32)
2020 this one says has a Pokeball (27:28 - 27:36)
Pokemon Center 2023 Pokemon Nintendo (27:32 - 27:39)
Creatures game freak made in China (27:36 - 27:42)
there's more words all those words add (27:39 - 27:44)
up to the price you're just not thinking (27:42 - 27:47)
about typography and how much that costs (27:44 - 27:49)
to put on the back of a wooden sign that (27:47 - 27:52)
you'll never see you'll know it's there (27:49 - 27:54)
in your heart creatures in Nintendo are (27:52 - 27:56)
thinking every time we sell this pseudo (27:54 - 28:00)
Widow piece piece of art we can possibly (27:56 - 28:03)
put one more frame rate into the game (28:00 - 28:05)
you can have Farm Fresh trees up all (28:03 - 28:07)
around trees grow all season people are (28:05 - 28:09)
cutting trees down for is that what it (28:07 - 28:13)
says Farm Fresh treeses open (28:09 - 28:16)
daily you could be selling trees at any (28:13 - 28:17)
given (28:16 - 28:20)
time of the year I'm only giving you (28:17 - 28:23)
permission to buy that if you have a (28:20 - 28:25)
tree themed (28:23 - 28:28)
bathroom what then it's when when are (28:25 - 28:31)
you the Arbiter of what people can buy (28:28 - 28:33)
never is the answer I will I'm now (28:31 - 28:35)
buying this out of spite and I'm hanging (28:33 - 28:39)
it up in my nautical bathroom where it's (28:35 - 28:42)
all ships and there'll be one sign about (28:39 - 28:45)
trees I would love to go pick up a (28:42 - 28:47)
Christmas tree and see that just hanging (28:45 - 28:50)
up on the side of the Shack or wherever (28:47 - 28:52)
they're selling them not even buy from (28:50 - 28:55)
those people oh yeah yeah you have my (28:52 - 28:57)
business you see a sudoo you're happy (28:55 - 28:59)
did we talk about the luxury ball being (28:57 - 29:00)
out we did that last week it's right (28:59 - 29:02)
there uh yeah luxury Ball's out hasn't (29:00 - 29:07)
sold out so $120 which I don't know if (29:02 - 29:10)
the $120 is inflation because they have (29:07 - 29:12)
all been 100 up to this point with the (29:10 - 29:13)
exception of the master ball which was (29:12 - 29:17)
120 but was limited to 5,000 in the US (29:13 - 29:20)
that being said it would make sense for (29:17 - 29:22)
the luxury ball to be more expensive (29:20 - 29:24)
it's luxury because it's luxury it is (29:22 - 29:26)
more expensive in the game as well so (29:24 - 29:29)
that I don't (29:26 - 29:31)
know I don't know if that's just (29:29 - 29:35)
capitalism at this point or I will say (29:31 - 29:37)
that out of all the pokeballs because (29:35 - 29:39)
this is like the 14th one I've I've (29:37 - 29:41)
purchased well technically I didn't (29:39 - 29:42)
purchase one of them one one of them was (29:41 - 29:44)
gifted I think it was the love ball or (29:42 - 29:47)
the dive ball or something anyways um my (29:44 - 29:50)
disclosure that sometimes I get free (29:47 - 29:54)
stuff the luxury ball is a fingerprint (29:50 - 29:56)
magnet it is so hard like you can't even (29:54 - 29:58)
take that out of the box box without it (29:56 - 30:00)
just sucking up every single fingerprint (29:58 - 30:02)
I was going to say they made it much (30:00 - 30:05)
glossier than the other ones it's really (30:02 - 30:06)
that's (30:05 - 30:08)
the it's luxurious and because it's (30:06 - 30:10)
glossy and because it's such a dark (30:08 - 30:13)
color yeah no that's going to collect (30:10 - 30:18)
fingerprints oh also again owning all 14 (30:13 - 30:20)
now the luxury ball has a different (30:18 - 30:23)
light up ring on the center Greg (30:20 - 30:25)
probably I you don't have any of the (30:23 - 30:29)
other ones right Greg but I Lu only (30:25 - 30:32)
the for the first 13 it was like this (30:29 - 30:34)
you could just see like oh the light (30:32 - 30:37)
comes out of this ring that you set it (30:34 - 30:40)
into when you open it and this one they (30:37 - 30:42)
like made it (30:40 - 30:45)
glossy so it looks a little bit better (30:42 - 30:46)
it (30:45 - 30:48)
like I think it diffuses the light a (30:46 - 30:50)
little bit better so when you set the (30:48 - 30:52)
luxury ball it you get a little bit more (30:50 - 30:55)
light so they did change it (30:52 - 30:59)
um the hinges on these boxes are still (30:55 - 31:02)
like the worst hinges in the entire (30:59 - 31:05)
world I don't I'm like kind of I kind of (31:02 - 31:07)
want to put like some WD40 or something (31:05 - 31:10)
and see if that anything (31:07 - 31:12)
helps but then I'm also afraid of (31:10 - 31:14)
ruining it but like yeah no just accept (31:12 - 31:16)
that I mean how just accept that the (31:14 - 31:17)
hinge is bad how often are you g to (31:16 - 31:20)
really open it though yeah I mean that's (31:17 - 31:22)
the thing too is like I think it looks (31:20 - 31:24)
better sitting on top of the box than (31:22 - 31:27)
having the Box open I don't know if (31:24 - 31:28)
they'll be able to see it in the youtube (31:27 - 31:31)
Greg you get (31:28 - 31:33)
cropped well UNC (31:31 - 31:36)
it UNC it for two seconds C it for the (31:33 - 31:40)
specific pointing (31:36 - 31:40)
yeah (31:40 - 31:45)
um this is the last one there are no (31:41 - 31:48)
more coming as of now so unless that we (31:45 - 31:50)
know of right that we know of yeah I (31:48 - 31:53)
don't know when the next toy fair is but (31:50 - 31:55)
the one that I think I well they haven't (31:53 - 31:56)
done (31:55 - 31:59)
moonball they haven't done Beast ball (31:56 - 32:01)
which I think would probably be one of (31:59 - 32:02)
the cooler (32:01 - 32:04)
ones I don't know if they would ever do (32:02 - 32:07)
strange Ball but man I love the strange (32:04 - 32:09)
ball I think the strange ball is so cool (32:07 - 32:11)
I want them to do the standard huan (32:09 - 32:13)
Pokeball I would love having a very high (32:11 - 32:16)
quality version of the standard jesuan (32:13 - 32:18)
Pokeball there is the (32:16 - 32:21)
rock poly I think it's a poly Stone (32:18 - 32:23)
material of the huan Pokeball Pokeball (32:21 - 32:27)
on Pokemon Center it's not the W company (32:23 - 32:29)
it's a totally different it's just it's (32:27 - 32:32)
it's whatever po it's probably the same (32:29 - 32:35)
company that makes the scam choo choo (32:32 - 32:37)
train stuff that you can get y I know (32:35 - 32:38)
somebody who listens to the podcast who (32:37 - 32:41)
has like every part of that Pokemon (32:38 - 32:43)
train good for them I wish it was a (32:41 - 32:46)
better material I was kind of I was so (32:43 - 32:48)
close to going all in on the train but I (32:46 - 32:50)
was just not happy with the first I got (32:48 - 32:52)
the first one that sits in my basement (32:50 - 32:56)
never to be put out for Christmas (32:52 - 32:56)
ever (32:56 - 33:01)
yeah I think it's uh I don't really know (32:58 - 33:03)
what I from last I read what poly Stone (33:01 - 33:05)
was was a mixture of like rock and (33:03 - 33:07)
plastic and like Granite it's not it's (33:05 - 33:11)
not like fully Rock on the uh Pokemon (33:07 - 33:14)
Center page for the Pokeball replica (33:11 - 33:18)
figure it just says resin high quality (33:14 - 33:20)
resin I feel like that made me less (33:18 - 33:24)
interested in it I think on the actual (33:20 - 33:26)
box that I received it said poly Stone (33:24 - 33:28)
cuz I never heard that word before poly (33:26 - 33:30)
stone is an organic material made from (33:28 - 33:34)
cement silica sand water stone powder (33:30 - 33:37)
reinforced with polyester resin and poly (33:34 - 33:41)
foam got it oh there you go look with (33:37 - 33:43)
whether you bought the W company or this (33:41 - 33:45)
poly Stone Pokeball if somebody breaks (33:43 - 33:48)
into your house and you got a good (33:45 - 33:50)
arm man that thing that thing will knock (33:48 - 33:52)
anyone out it will put a hole in your (33:50 - 33:54)
wall I don't think people realize when (33:52 - 33:56)
they comment on like my Tik toks or my (33:54 - 33:57)
shorts of these like there's heavy (33:56 - 34:00)
they're heavy I I don't I think I looked (33:57 - 34:03)
up what a pool ball weighs cuz I I would (34:00 - 34:05)
I would say a pool ball is pretty heavy (34:03 - 34:06)
like you don't want to get hit by a pool (34:05 - 34:10)
ball either no it doesn't and I'm pretty (34:06 - 34:11)
sure this is twice as heavy as a pool (34:10 - 34:14)
ball from what I what I looked I could (34:11 - 34:16)
be misremembering it was a long time ago (34:14 - 34:21)
when I was like how heavy is a pool ball (34:16 - 34:23)
uh billiard ball is 6 (34:21 - 34:26)
oz yeah and I think these are like 12 (34:23 - 34:29)
yeah that sounds about cuz a a pound is (34:26 - 34:32)
16 oz it's and it's not quite a (34:29 - 34:37)
pound do I need Lu is 1 the luxury ball (34:32 - 34:41)
is 1.3 pounds oh yeah wait (34:37 - 34:44)
what oh that might be including that (34:41 - 34:45)
might be including the box that's (34:44 - 34:48)
probably incling Bo box is the cheapest (34:45 - 34:51)
piece of the Box weighs negative at this (34:48 - 34:53)
point it's (34:51 - 34:53)
so there was also a point where they (34:55 - 34:59)
like like switched I think right now if (34:57 - 35:00)
you were to buy the Pokeball I think it (34:59 - 35:02)
comes in a black box but mine came in (35:00 - 35:05)
like a gray (35:02 - 35:07)
box they like switched the boxes at some (35:05 - 35:10)
point you got the original yeah I did (35:07 - 35:13)
get the original (35:10 - 35:13)
yeah um anyways speaking of money oh I (35:13 - 35:20)
lost I lost my show notes (35:16 - 35:25)
uh we're let's talk about the uh the (35:20 - 35:27)
economic impact yeah this I'm I'm really (35:25 - 35:29)
making you guys excited for this next (35:27 - 35:33)
segment ntic Niantic put out a press (35:29 - 35:34)
release (35:33 - 35:38)
of uh saying that Pokemon go Fest (35:34 - 35:41)
delivers more than $300 million in (35:38 - 35:45)
economic impact globally now uh if (35:41 - 35:48)
you're like what does that actually mean (35:45 - 35:52)
uh it means that these uh IRL (35:48 - 35:55)
invents bring a ton of money to the (35:52 - 35:57)
cities they go into (35:55 - 36:00)
which would then mean that more (35:57 - 36:02)
companies would want to or so more (36:00 - 36:04)
cities SL countries I'm not actually (36:02 - 36:07)
sure at what level that goes down to uh (36:04 - 36:11)
would want to bid on these because uh (36:07 - 36:13)
they make money like tours them brings (36:11 - 36:16)
in money and then that makes their (36:13 - 36:18)
economy better (36:16 - 36:21)
um so this is this was published on (36:18 - 36:22)
November (36:21 - 36:25)
9th uh (36:22 - 36:28)
Niantic says here across New York London (36:25 - 36:31)
Osaka Pokémon go Fest generated a (36:28 - 36:35)
combined 323 million for local economies (36:31 - 36:37)
okay so that just end a disclosure here (36:35 - 36:39)
this this is not saying that Pokemon go (36:37 - 36:39)
made (36:39 - 36:42)
323 million it is saying these cities (36:39 - 36:45)
specifically made this (36:42 - 36:48)
money outside of go so whether that's (36:45 - 36:52)
like somebody buying bus fair or hotels (36:48 - 36:56)
or food or being a tourist and going to (36:52 - 36:59)
a museum uh it's bringing in that (36:56 - 37:04)
money uh inclusive uh of 73.8 million in (36:59 - 37:07)
tax revenues according to a report (37:04 - 37:10)
conducted by stat stat (37:07 - 37:14)
statista stat statista statista oh that (37:10 - 37:16)
sounds way better kind of sounds like (37:14 - 37:18)
Batista (37:16 - 37:21)
statista uh what's more exciting is that (37:18 - 37:22)
these figures translate into actual (37:21 - 37:25)
expenses that means uh (37:22 - 37:28)
194,000 people (37:25 - 37:31)
uh connected with Pokemon go during (37:28 - 37:32)
those (37:31 - 37:38)
weekends uh in comparison the 2023 UFA (37:32 - 37:42)
Championship League final is is that (37:38 - 37:45)
soccer what is what is the U UFA (37:42 - 37:47)
champions league is an annual Club (37:45 - 37:49)
association football competition so yes (37:47 - 37:53)
soccer soccer soccer okay uh brings an a (37:49 - 37:56)
projected economic boost of 80 million (37:53 - 37:58)
uh toost host in the city of Instanbul (37:56 - 38:01)
Eurovision boosted by Liverpool uh (37:58 - 38:05)
brought in 66.2 million and Taylor Swift (38:01 - 38:08)
oh boy I didn't think (38:05 - 38:10)
that I think we'd be talking you picked (38:08 - 38:13)
the article I did the article was put (38:10 - 38:17)
out by Niantic I I just want to look if (38:13 - 38:20)
you're a Taylor Swift fan I am not get (38:17 - 38:23)
I'm not saying that she doesn't bring in (38:20 - 38:25)
a lot of money but statistically she (38:23 - 38:27)
ain't bringing in the same amount of (38:25 - 38:30)
money as Pokémon go in one particular (38:27 - 38:32)
City this is only referencing Taylor (38:30 - 38:35)
Swift's tour in Kansas City in Kansas (38:32 - 38:38)
you know the metrop Metropol exactly a (38:35 - 38:41)
fair comparison of Kansas City you know (38:38 - 38:47)
Kansas City gets tens of tourists every (38:41 - 38:51)
year you know don't London or New York (38:47 - 38:53)
no no no you want to go to Kansas City (38:51 - 38:57)
this year Kansas where nothing Happ (38:53 - 39:00)
Taylor Swift brought in $48 million to (38:57 - 39:03)
the local economy hey so if you if you (39:00 - 39:05)
were to break down the Pokemon go that's (39:03 - 39:08)
that's a 100 million per event so what (39:05 - 39:10)
we're saying is Pokemon go needs to get (39:08 - 39:13)
on the Taylor Swift schedule and just (39:10 - 39:15)
keep hitting city after (39:13 - 39:18)
city they're probably (39:15 - 39:20)
trying yeah Niantic would probably love (39:18 - 39:22)
that (39:20 - 39:25)
actually um randle's Island Park in New (39:22 - 39:28)
York City uh on August 18th had an (39:25 - 39:33)
economic boost of 140 million uh and $28 (39:28 - 39:36)
million in tax (39:33 - 39:40)
revenue um new they this is a quote from (39:36 - 39:42)
them New York's cities is the world's (39:40 - 39:43)
largest stage when it comes to Live (39:42 - 39:45)
Events the Niantic team proved to be a (39:43 - 39:47)
great partner in our efforts to bring (39:45 - 39:49)
Pokemon go Fest to the five buroughs (39:47 - 39:51)
this past summer and the results of the (39:49 - 39:52)
economic impact study speak for (39:51 - 39:55)
themselves Said Fred Dixon president and (39:52 - 39:58)
CEO of New York City tourism plus (39:55 - 40:01)
conventions quote the event created an (39:58 - 40:03)
opportunity to showcase the city to (40:01 - 40:05)
players and fans around the world 21% (40:03 - 40:08)
was the first time visiting New York we (40:05 - 40:10)
look forward to bringing them back to (40:08 - 40:13)
New York City again in the future uh (40:10 - 40:15)
Randall Island Park Alliance was (40:13 - 40:17)
thrilled to have Pokemon go make its (40:15 - 40:20)
appearance at the park this summer said (40:17 - 40:22)
Deborah Maher president of Randall's (40:20 - 40:24)
Island oh dang Randall Island has their (40:22 - 40:26)

that made Pokémon go Fest 2023 a success (40:31 - 40:35)
and we welcome them back in the future (40:34 - 40:38)
all right I am going to put a small hole (40:35 - 40:42)
into this by reading you these two (40:38 - 40:44)
paragraphs analysts estimate that the (40:42 - 40:47)
Taylor Swift eras tour will likely (40:44 - 40:50)
surpass $1 (40:47 - 40:52)
billion (40:50 - 40:54)
internationally it will hold the current (40:52 - 40:55)
record of (40:54 - 40:59)
939 million in the United States and is (40:55 - 41:01)
projected to generate close (40:59 - 41:05)
to5 billion dollar in commu in consumer (41:01 - 41:08)
spending in the United States alone once (41:05 - 41:10)
again though not a fair (41:08 - 41:13)
comparison one of these is a few cities (41:10 - 41:16)
and one of those is many many cities (41:13 - 41:17)
across the entire country if they're (41:16 - 41:21)
going to say listen to us we have three (41:17 - 41:23)
cities for 300 million and they're going (41:21 - 41:25)
to pull they're going to drag Taylor (41:23 - 41:28)
Swift for Kansas City let's talk about (41:25 - 41:31)
the billions of dollars internationally (41:28 - 41:35)
this woman does she has she has a bigger (41:31 - 41:39)
economy than like 50 countries at this (41:35 - 41:42)
point yeah what what we're saying is (41:39 - 41:46)
piku is on go or Taylor Swift in our (41:42 - 41:49)
city you're gonna go with Taylor Swift (41:46 - 41:52)
like I don't know unless you're Kansas (41:49 - 41:55)
City apparently this is here for the (41:52 - 41:58)
listener Taylor Swift related whether (41:55 - 42:00)
you like her or not I was I was downtown (41:58 - 42:04)
Minneapolis when Taylor Swift was uh (42:00 - 42:06)
about to perform I was on my one wheeel (42:04 - 42:08)
there's a lot of bike paths downtown I (42:06 - 42:10)
like to go across the Old Stone Arch (42:08 - 42:12)
Bridge on the one wheel very good can (42:10 - 42:14)
anymore yeah they're closing that down (42:12 - 42:16)
but uh this is what I witnessed I (42:14 - 42:19)
watched a Man Out of Nowhere wheel a (42:16 - 42:24)
giant cart of pink hats onto the street (42:19 - 42:27)
and that man made so much money in in (42:24 - 42:30)
seconds I he probably ordered a mass (42:27 - 42:33)
amount of pink cowboy hats from Amazon (42:30 - 42:35)
and this man was selling them at like (42:33 - 42:40)
$25 a pop and a lot the line to buy pink (42:35 - 42:42)
hats were just as long as the line to (42:40 - 42:44)
get into the US Bank Stadium it was (42:42 - 42:47)
insane how many girlies and the few men (42:44 - 42:51)
there uh wanted to get a pink hat so it (42:47 - 42:54)
was this this was a double whammy cuz (42:51 - 42:57)
Taylor swis was here over Pride weekend (42:54 - 43:01)
so the pink hat sold across multiple (42:57 - 43:03)
events yeah once everyone goes into US (43:01 - 43:06)
Bank you just push it over to Pride yeah (43:03 - 43:08)
there are a ton of Pride people downtown (43:06 - 43:10)
who would want a pink hat there are a (43:08 - 43:12)
ton of tiller Swift people down there is (43:10 - 43:14)
a huge crossover between people who (43:12 - 43:16)
attended pride and people who went to (43:14 - 43:20)
Taylor Swift it was a whole cultural (43:16 - 43:21)
thing that (43:20 - 43:26)
weekend there was um when side sto when (43:21 - 43:29)
I was in Seattle last year for Pokémon (43:26 - 43:33)
go Fest there was uh so prior to Pokémon (43:29 - 43:35)
go Fest starting I don't know if (43:33 - 43:37)
anyone's been to the like Seattle Center (43:35 - 43:39)
where the Space Needle is there's a (43:37 - 43:41)
bunch of um like musical performers like (43:39 - 43:43)
with their violin or with their their (43:41 - 43:45)
drums or whatever you know you pay for (43:43 - 43:47)
that spot right like you you pay for (43:45 - 43:50)
your time spot to play some music and H (43:47 - 43:51)
have people throw change and whatever (43:50 - 43:54)
into your thing right (43:51 - 43:58)
and uh one of the locals there that I (43:54 - 44:01)
met up with said that this guy on the (43:58 - 44:03)
violin has been practicing Pokemon songs (44:01 - 44:06)
for like the last month in preparation (44:03 - 44:09)
of go Fest that's amazing and I was (44:06 - 44:11)
there a couple days early because (44:09 - 44:12)
Niantic that was the one that nitic paid (44:11 - 44:15)
for me and flew me out too um and so I (44:12 - 44:18)
saw this guy like doing like Pokemon (44:15 - 44:20)
songs on his (44:18 - 44:23)
violin when goest (44:20 - 44:26)
started he had a paper sign up saying (44:23 - 44:31)
I'm not allowed to play Pokemon music (44:26 - 44:31)
sorry I don't (44:32 - 44:39)
know if it was Niantic or if it was (44:34 - 44:41)
Pokemon if it was (44:39 - 44:44)
Nintendo because legally he had the (44:41 - 44:46)
right to be in the park because he paid (44:44 - 44:50)
for that like that spot but the I don't (44:46 - 44:52)
know what happened but this man was (44:50 - 44:54)
practicing Pokemon songs for a couple (44:52 - 44:56)
weeks and then when the event started he (44:54 - 44:58)
was not allowed to play Pokemon songs he (44:56 - 45:00)
was very good at the violin though Get (44:58 - 45:02)
Wrecked for copyright infringement I (45:00 - 45:06)
guess um that that I'm I'm sure I'm sure (45:02 - 45:09)
he still made out very well that weekend (45:06 - 45:11)
with the thousands of Pokemon players (45:09 - 45:13)
the sign is good also for sympathy money (45:11 - 45:16)
I'd be like a he has a (45:13 - 45:18)
couple boy maybe no one talked to him it (45:16 - 45:21)
was just reverse (45:18 - 45:23)
psychology I I don't think I think (45:21 - 45:25)
somebody talked to him I wouldn't be (45:23 - 45:28)
surprised at all (45:25 - 45:30)
okay so uh the cool thing about this (45:28 - 45:31)
article is we actually found out how (45:30 - 45:33)
many people went to each event so that's (45:31 - 45:36)
pretty cool uh so New York uh had an (45:33 - 45:40)
economic boost of $140 million which is (45:36 - 45:42)
a lot of money take that Taylor Swift (45:40 - 45:46)
Kansas City uh with uh $28 million of (45:42 - 45:49)
tax revenue (45:46 - 45:52)
$74,000 tickets were (45:49 - 45:55)
sold with with (45:52 - 45:59)
58% being being between 27 and 44 years (45:55 - 46:02)
old which is actually crazy to think (45:59 - 46:06)
about um I've I've talked about this (46:02 - 46:09)
before when I've gone to multiple go (46:06 - 46:11)
fests or Safari zones whether that's in (46:09 - 46:14)
Korea Japan Seattle Chicago there are (46:11 - 46:17)
kids there but not as many as you would (46:14 - 46:19)
think um I don't know if Hannah could (46:17 - 46:22)
speak to New York if you saw Oodles of (46:19 - 46:24)
Oodles of kids I don't think there were (46:22 - 46:26)
oodles and oodles of kids but also I am (46:24 - 46:28)
under 27 at the (46:26 - 46:33)
moment you are the 42% Get (46:28 - 46:33)
Wrecked you're the (46:33 - 46:42)
42 so I I am in that yes I don't think (46:36 - 46:43)
there were a ton of kids there were (46:42 - 46:46)
definitely some but it was mostly adults (46:43 - 46:50)
yeah well you know anytime I do see like (46:46 - 46:51)
parents with like strollers and stuff it (46:50 - 46:53)
feels like the kids are just like very (46:51 - 46:56)
over it after like two or three hours (46:53 - 46:59)
they're like this is the problem like (46:56 - 47:01)
watching parents bring their kids (46:59 - 47:03)
through Gen Con the same thing they were (47:01 - 47:06)
done 5 minutes after hitting that crowd (47:03 - 47:09)
and I'm like good luck you're got dead (47:06 - 47:11)
weight at this point because they (47:09 - 47:14)
stopped caring and they just want to go (47:11 - 47:18)
home yeah uh so the average spend the (47:14 - 47:21)
average visitors spent (47:18 - 47:24)
$783 (47:21 - 47:26)
which that seems cheap in New York that (47:24 - 47:29)
does seem cheap in New York that's the (47:26 - 47:31)
that's the cost of the (47:29 - 47:34)
hotel at (47:31 - 47:40)
least uh yeah um 21% was the of (47:34 - 47:42)
attendees were the first time attending (47:40 - 47:44)
New York which is actually a crazy (47:42 - 47:47)
statistic um although there's a lot of (47:44 - 47:49)
people who have not been to New York so (47:47 - 47:51)
it's (47:49 - 47:51)
expensive um UHD 35 million Pokemon were (47:53 - 47:59)
caught during New York go Fest the (47:57 - 48:03)
average attendee walked 18 miles um I (47:59 - 48:05)
don't know if that was like all weekend (48:03 - 48:08)
uh because I feel like I walk like 10ish (48:05 - 48:12)
miles a day for go Fest (48:08 - 48:17)
well yeah I feel like we walked 15 miles (48:12 - 48:21)
a day I walked 15 miles a day but I (48:17 - 48:22)
guess there are a lot of people that (48:21 - 48:23)
maybe just like sit and play for quite a (48:22 - 48:26)
long time and maybe only do like a mile (48:23 - 48:27)
to the park and walk around only in the (48:26 - 48:30)
park right (48:27 - 48:34)
yeah uh London uh that was uh in (48:30 - 48:37)
Brockwell Park uh it had a economic (48:34 - 48:39)
impact of $ (48:37 - 48:43)
55.9 million $26.8 million in tax (48:39 - 48:47)
revenue that event had 50,000 people (48:43 - 48:48)
travel and (48:47 - 48:52)
play um throughout the city 62% of (48:48 - 48:56)
attendees came outside of the UK to (48:52 - 48:57)
participate in the (48:56 - 49:01)
event um which is crazy 60% of those (48:57 - 49:05)
attendees were between 25 and 44 I I (49:01 - 49:08)
think the reason Niantic highlights that (49:05 - 49:09)
specific like why are they highlighting (49:08 - 49:11)
older people it's because they spend (49:09 - 49:13)
more (49:11 - 49:16)
money right like a like a 13-year-old or (49:13 - 49:17)
14-year-old would need their parents' (49:16 - 49:18)
permission and they're probably not (49:17 - 49:20)
spending as much as an adult with their (49:18 - 49:21)
own money making their own decisions (49:20 - 49:23)
well they had to widen the age range in (49:21 - 49:27)
this one they did yeah um each visitor (49:23 - 49:30)
average spent (49:27 - 49:34)
$522 and 49% of attendees said that they (49:30 - 49:38)
would visit London again in the next (49:34 - 49:38)
year um and then we go to Osaka go Fest (49:39 - 49:45)
this is the one I was at uh this brought (49:42 - 49:50)
in $38 million and $1.6 million in tax (49:45 - 49:54)
revenue this had 60,000 trainers attend (49:50 - 49:57)
the 3-day event at the expose 70 (49:54 - 49:58)
commemorative (49:57 - 50:01)
Park (49:58 - 50:01)
um I think it would probably be higher (50:02 - 50:06)
if the Yen wasn't so garbage right now (50:04 - 50:09)
like the yen is so terrible and it's (50:06 - 50:11)
like not getting any better good for (50:09 - 50:12)
American if you're American going there (50:11 - 50:14)
your dollar is very very strong but like (50:12 - 50:17)
as as a whole it's not good (50:14 - 50:20)
when nothing translates to the Yen very (50:17 - 50:23)
well (50:20 - 50:28)
um uh Osaka attendee spent $1.7 million (50:23 - 50:33)
on shopping the average uh visitor spent (50:28 - 50:37)
$335 for that weekend uh 78% of the (50:33 - 50:40)
people who attended were from Japan 2% (50:37 - 50:44)
of people came from the United States (50:40 - 50:46)
well they said primarily the United (50:44 - 50:49)
States um I remember taking the survey (50:46 - 50:50)
and I was like why am I giving n (50:49 - 50:53)
whatever I was on a I was on a train I (50:50 - 50:56)
was like I guess I'll take the survey um (50:53 - 50:58)
21 million Pokemon were caught during (50:56 - 51:03)
goes Osaka um and yeah so now we know (50:58 - 51:05)
how many people attended these events (51:03 - 51:07)
and how much money it made you know (51:05 - 51:11)
whether or not you like Pokemon go (51:07 - 51:14)
um it's very cool that these events do (51:11 - 51:16)
well still it's very cool that these (51:14 - 51:18)
events bring people to cities I don't (51:16 - 51:20)
think this is not this is not like an (51:18 - 51:24)
Olympic problem where the Olympics ruins (51:20 - 51:27)
cities I I am (51:24 - 51:31)
curious what the economic environmental (51:27 - 51:33)
Etc (51:31 - 51:36)
impact is because they aren't mentioning (51:33 - 51:38)
that and that is like the dirty secret (51:36 - 51:40)
of the Olympics like Olympics will say (51:38 - 51:43)
we made8 billion but it costs the city (51:40 - 51:46)
like 20 billion dollars to handle (51:43 - 51:48)
everything so I'm always curious (51:46 - 51:50)
whenever they put things out like this (51:48 - 51:52)
I'm like okay but what is it what is it (51:50 - 51:56)
costing the city and what is it costing (51:52 - 51:58)
the people in the city is another (51:56 - 52:00)
question there this is an article that (51:58 - 52:03)
is put out by Niantic this article is on (52:00 - 52:07)
niantic's website it is using (52:03 - 52:09)
statistics from a company commissioned (52:07 - 52:12)
by Niantic this is this is the thing (52:09 - 52:14)
that they send to cities when they want (52:12 - 52:16)
to say hey we want to do an event in (52:14 - 52:19)
your city you make so much money it's (52:16 - 52:21)
it's it it's a little propaganda a (52:19 - 52:23)
little bit I mean it's it's it's a lot (52:21 - 52:26)
of marketing right like you know I won't (52:23 - 52:27)
blame them for marketing I'm sure the (52:26 - 52:30)
economic Boon is great uh we do have an (52:27 - 52:33)
example of another large event that is (52:30 - 52:36)
not so great it is the Olympics the (52:33 - 52:38)
difference here (52:36 - 52:41)
being in general they don't have to (52:38 - 52:44)
build something to house Pokemon go (52:41 - 52:46)
right like the biggest problem with the (52:44 - 52:47)
Olympics is they build all of these (52:46 - 52:49)
stadiums and these incredible things (52:47 - 52:55)
that then go empty and unused for ever (52:49 - 52:58)
in a lot of cases um but like the (52:55 - 53:00)
environmental impacts and just the (52:58 - 53:03)
impacts of of having a huge influx of (53:00 - 53:06)
people come in at one point of time does (53:03 - 53:09)
cost money which they are not talking (53:06 - 53:13)
about in this article um I doubt it is (53:09 - 53:16)
as bad as the Olympics I it is probably (53:13 - 53:18)
the cost of doing business the same as (53:16 - 53:20)
when there is a Super Bowl brought into (53:18 - 53:23)
your town right like Super Bowl (53:20 - 53:26)
generates a lot of money but also (53:23 - 53:28)
you can't ignore the damage that that (53:26 - 53:31)
many people do to a city like we had (53:28 - 53:33)
this is the wildest thing so the Super (53:31 - 53:35)
Bowl is in (53:33 - 53:40)
Minnesota and all of these people flew (53:35 - 53:45)
here not understanding how cold it (53:40 - 53:46)
was (53:45 - 53:50)
so hundreds of people like thousands of (53:46 - 53:51)
people went around and bought all of (53:50 - 53:53)
these winter coats up so there were none (53:51 - 53:57)
left for anything else (53:53 - 53:57)
volunteer groups went through all the (53:59 - 54:06)
hotel rooms and picked up thousands of (54:03 - 54:09)
abandoned coats because they because (54:06 - 54:10)
they didn't want to take them back they (54:09 - 54:11)
didn't want to take them home so they (54:10 - 54:12)
bought them wor them for the G and just (54:11 - 54:15)
left them in the room thousands and (54:12 - 54:17)
thousands and thousands of coats just (54:15 - 54:19)
left everywhere because they were flying (54:17 - 54:21)
back to Florida or Texas where they (54:19 - 54:23)
would never use them so they didn't even (54:21 - 54:25)
bother to donate them they just left (54:23 - 54:27)
them in the hotel rooms and I know (54:25 - 54:29)
people who went around hotel to hotel to (54:27 - 54:32)
be like we will gather up all of your (54:29 - 54:36)
now used can't be resold winter clothing (54:32 - 54:38)
that was used for three (54:36 - 54:42)
days and distribute them out the best we (54:38 - 54:43)
can through all the charitable (54:42 - 54:45)
organizations and like those are like (54:43 - 54:48)
the weird hidden things that happen when (54:45 - 54:51)
large events happen in your city so like (54:48 - 54:55)
I'm curious to see from a city like how (54:51 - 54:56)
much did it cost you to put in here what (54:55 - 54:59)
were the what were the hidden costs of (54:56 - 55:01)
Hosting this what's the hidden cost of (54:59 - 55:04)
having a ton of people like 10 times the (55:01 - 55:07)
foot traffic in a park right like (55:04 - 55:09)
there's grounds that have to be kept up (55:07 - 55:11)
there's trees that have to be dealt with (55:09 - 55:13)
there's people who don't read signs like (55:11 - 55:16)
the grass there's trash there's people (55:13 - 55:19)
who damage stuff just because they're (55:16 - 55:22)
people um so like it's cool that they (55:19 - 55:24)
make this much money but I would also (55:22 - 55:28)
I'm just absolutely in my brain curious (55:24 - 55:30)
what is the what is the cost of the city (55:28 - 55:32)
to house this like what's the profit (55:30 - 55:35)
margin that they're seeing I feel like (55:32 - 55:37)
it's probably still a pretty good profit (55:35 - 55:41)
margin probably is oh yeah I I I I I (55:37 - 55:44)
think back to the Las Vegas event um (55:41 - 55:46)
which right now there's problems with (55:44 - 55:49)
the F1 race that has been being reported (55:46 - 55:53)
but I still think Las Vegas screwed over (55:49 - 55:56)
Niantic because uh I I talked about this (55:53 - 56:00)
and I know go cast um they talked about (55:56 - 56:02)
it as well that Park was like under (56:00 - 56:04)
construction and there was a Giant (56:02 - 56:07)
Mountain of dirt because they were (56:04 - 56:11)
trying to build something and they had (56:07 - 56:13)
this is not an exaggeration they had to (56:11 - 56:16)
put a security guard on the pile of dirt (56:13 - 56:19)
this huge mountain of rocks because (56:16 - 56:22)
because not kids grown adults were (56:19 - 56:24)
climbing this Mount this mountain of (56:22 - 56:27)
rocks to stand up there and it was (56:24 - 56:30)
dangerous so they had to position a (56:27 - 56:32)
security guard but I went through all (56:30 - 56:34)
the pictures of this (56:32 - 56:37)
park because you know you get there and (56:34 - 56:39)
you're like what's happening why why is (56:37 - 56:41)
there so much dirt why is there so much (56:39 - 56:42)
construction and you go back to the (56:41 - 56:44)
pictures and it's like they advertised (56:42 - 56:47)
it as like this beautiful like Las Vegas (56:44 - 56:50)
Park just like minutes away from this (56:47 - 56:52)
strip it's minutes away if there is no (56:50 - 56:55)
traffic uh no traffic in Vegas does not (56:52 - 56:57)
exist you you you will you could (56:55 - 57:00)
probably walk faster to the Vegas trip (56:57 - 57:03)
than sitting in a car so I I do kind of (57:00 - 57:04)
think (57:03 - 57:08)
like did Vegas kind of lie about like (57:04 - 57:10)
this beautiful Park and then Niantic was (57:08 - 57:13)
like oh I I I guess I mean we're already (57:10 - 57:16)
here I I doubt they lied about it I (57:13 - 57:18)
guarantee you in the time that they (57:16 - 57:20)
signed the paperwork the construction (57:18 - 57:22)
side I'm sure they just didn't say also (57:20 - 57:24)
during that time frame we'll be doing (57:22 - 57:26)
construction on the park I'm sure they (57:24 - 57:28)
sold it as a complete Park and then (57:26 - 57:30)
we're like well we just need to start (57:28 - 57:31)
this (57:30 - 57:34)
project well it should be it's probably (57:31 - 57:36)
it was probably the oh it'll be done by (57:34 - 57:40)
then by then it was never done like like (57:36 - 57:41)
that (57:40 - 57:45)
Park was like it had four um like zones (57:41 - 57:47)
or areas or whatever and like two of (57:45 - 57:50)
them were nice and then the other two (57:47 - 57:52)
were like separated by this just giant (57:50 - 57:54)
rock pile where like they were building (57:52 - 57:56)
kind of like a river to go through but (57:54 - 57:58)
there was no (57:56 - 58:01)
water it was just like very awkward to (57:58 - 58:04)
be back there because it was like it it (58:01 - 58:06)
just didn't feel like a part it felt it (58:04 - 58:09)
felt like a construction site back (58:06 - 58:13)
there which again no fault to Niantic (58:09 - 58:16)
I'm sure they showed up a week before to (58:13 - 58:19)
set stuff up and was like oh there's (58:16 - 58:21)
thing oh how how do we make this (58:19 - 58:25)
good whatever um I I'm curious if you (58:21 - 58:28)
know these numbers like I only heard (58:25 - 58:29)
good things about the New York (58:28 - 58:32)
experience which is surprising because (58:29 - 58:33)
there was like one fery to get to (58:32 - 58:35)
randle's island and there's like one (58:33 - 58:38)
bridge to get to randle's island shut (58:35 - 58:40)
that I think some people used and I (58:38 - 58:41)
don't know if it's only good things (58:40 - 58:45)
there there was the the whole Verizon (58:41 - 58:47)
crashing oh yeah Verizon going out for (58:45 - 58:49)
like like two hours or something it was (58:47 - 58:52)
more than two hours but yeah (58:49 - 58:56)
um more good things than the Vegas (58:52 - 58:58)
that's for sure Vegas by the overall (58:56 - 59:00)
Pokémon go Community is still seen as a (58:58 - 59:03)
failure I don't know what people (59:00 - 59:06)
expected from Vegas really I mean the (59:03 - 59:08)
minute I heard it in Vegas I was like (59:06 - 59:12)
lower lower your expectations is Vegas (59:08 - 59:14)
Vegas is a city that will bid they they (59:12 - 59:17)
want tourism that's all they do they're (59:14 - 59:19)
in the middle of a desert what else is (59:17 - 59:20)
there but to bring people in to spend (59:19 - 59:23)
money get them drunk and fleece them (59:20 - 59:25)
that's the vas motto (59:23 - 59:27)
uh they made a death laser for crying (59:25 - 59:28)
out (59:27 - 59:32)
loud was was the Vegas earlier this year (59:28 - 59:33)
I can't this this year has been a (59:32 - 59:36)
nightmare to me it was this year I'm (59:33 - 59:39)
pretty sure yep if if you if you look at (59:36 - 59:42)
2023 for Vegas they fought for so much (59:39 - 59:46)
tourism compared to other cities in my (59:42 - 59:49)
opinion um I'm curious if New York will (59:46 - 59:52)
want Pokemon go to come back uh you know (59:49 - 59:54)
originally when the Pokémon Go stuff (59:52 - 59:58)
started Chicago did sign a threeyear (59:54 - 60:00)
agreement that's why it was there for 3 (59:58 - 60:01)
years who knows where it was supposed to (60:00 - 60:05)
be after Chicago because Co happened at (60:01 - 60:07)
that point so who knows if it was (60:05 - 60:08)
supposed to be New York or it was (60:07 - 60:10)
supposed to be back in Chicago or (60:08 - 60:13)
somewhere else um I think Seattle was (60:10 - 60:17)
incredibly successful uh when I was (60:13 - 60:18)
there (60:17 - 60:22)
uh in Japan it does seem to move around (60:18 - 60:26)
a bit but uh yeah the article there is (60:22 - 60:28)
the person saying we look forward to (60:26 - 60:30)
welcoming them back to NYC again in the (60:28 - 60:33)
future yeah (60:30 - 60:35)
so um I think the only people may be (60:33 - 60:37)
upset about it being in New York is (60:35 - 60:39)
probably West Coast people because that (60:37 - 60:42)
is a long flight for them or anyone who (60:39 - 60:43)
has trouble with the costs because New (60:42 - 60:45)
York is an expensive city to go to yeah (60:43 - 60:47)
it is an expensive city I mean Chicago (60:45 - 60:49)
is not any cheaper was in Chicago (60:47 - 60:53)
Seattle's also a pretty expensive city (60:49 - 60:57)
uh yeah I don't (60:53 - 60:57)
I don't know what other cities would (60:58 - 61:04)
want to fight for that but uh I would (61:00 - 61:08)
expect more Safari zones and (61:04 - 61:12)
more of these events next year so I want (61:08 - 61:14)
see more City I want to see more City (61:12 - 61:17)
safaris I would love to see if they do (61:14 - 61:20)
City safaris across the (61:17 - 61:23)
us at some point yeah that would be (61:20 - 61:25)
cool (61:23 - 61:28)
so um well I think that's I think that's (61:25 - 61:32)
our show uh unless it sounds like (61:28 - 61:34)
neither of you did Garchomp which you (61:32 - 61:37)
didn't miss out too much on I did I just (61:34 - 61:39)
didn't do more than two I just said I (61:37 - 61:41)
was chomping around the Twin Cities (61:39 - 61:43)
Chomp Chomp Chomp Chom (61:41 - 61:46)
Chomp it was incredible I tapped on my (61:43 - 61:50)
phone the things with the people and I (61:46 - 61:52)
fought I will say I tried to use (61:50 - 61:56)
campfire sorry you fought (61:52 - 61:56)
Craig Craig didn't play any gar he's (61:56 - 62:00)
just (61:58 - 62:03)
trampling you Chopped all all across the (62:00 - 62:05)
I chomped look I was (62:03 - 62:08)
chomping you everybody had to watch out (62:05 - 62:12)
for how hard I was chomping you have no (62:08 - 62:15)
clue I will say I really tried to use (62:12 - 62:17)
campfire to get people together because (62:15 - 62:20)
I was really looking to try and find a (62:17 - 62:21)
group of people in my neighborhood I (62:20 - 62:23)
really wanted to do more Garchomp (62:21 - 62:25)
because I (62:23 - 62:27)
I don't think I could have soloed it I (62:25 - 62:30)
didn't try even with my team that I put (62:27 - 62:34)
together I don't understand they so at (62:30 - 62:36)
first you used to go into the chat and (62:34 - 62:39)
set a flare when there was a raid you (62:36 - 62:41)
wanted to bring people to but now (62:39 - 62:43)
there's the whole team up thing which (62:41 - 62:45)
seems to be separate and it seems like (62:43 - 62:49)
when you set when you start a team up (62:45 - 62:52)
thing it doesn't do the same thing as a (62:49 - 62:56)
flare and now they have two seemingly (62:52 - 62:59)
conflicting things in this app neither (62:56 - 63:01)
of which worked I can't I still can't (62:59 - 63:03)
get campfire to work and I was doing the (63:01 - 63:05)
team up I was doing the flare I was (63:03 - 63:07)
going and sitting in the lobby again and (63:05 - 63:10)
again and again just waiting yeah trying (63:07 - 63:12)
to see if I could draw anybody over (63:10 - 63:17)
there to do a Garchomp with me but no no (63:12 - 63:19)
well you know I went to ball America and (63:17 - 63:21)
every Garchomp filled to 20 instantly (63:19 - 63:23)
without me talking to (63:21 - 63:26)
anyone I did learn the strategy was not (63:23 - 63:29)
to get there at 2 the strategy was to (63:26 - 63:29)
get there at (63:29 - 63:33)
2:45 do all the garchomps in 15 minutes (63:29 - 63:36)
and then right at 3 o'cl they all reset (63:33 - 63:37)
and you do them again and then it's (63:36 - 63:39)
amazing how your strategy for that day (63:37 - 63:40)
is also the strategy when you're trying (63:39 - 63:42)
to supposed to be meeting us up with us (63:40 - 63:44)
at 2 and you're like I'm five minutes (63:42 - 63:47)
away and 2:45 you wander into the mall (63:44 - 63:50)
yeah well at least in this time I sat in (63:47 - 63:51)
the parking lot for 20 minutes cuz no (63:50 - 63:55)
one knows these tourists I tell you no (63:51 - 63:57)
know drive in and out of mall America (63:55 - 63:59)
you just go to the very top that's all (63:57 - 64:01)
you got to do but people are like mall (63:59 - 64:03)
America parking for anyone that doesn't (64:01 - 64:05)
know they have numbers they will tell (64:03 - 64:07)

three spots left and people will be like (64:09 - 64:13)
oh I gotta find you're not gonna find (64:12 - 64:15)
those three spots because I guarantee (64:13 - 64:17)
you they're all double parked there (64:15 - 64:19)
there's not three spots left just go to (64:17 - 64:22)
the top where it says 400 spots left and (64:19 - 64:26)
just park it's fine everywhere four (64:22 - 64:28)

floor out of all of them second floor (64:34 - 64:37)

point yeah there's a lot uh field (67:33 - 67:38)
research is Butterfree Diglett Whooper (67:36 - 67:41)
curia Shinx and Blitzle so the only (67:38 - 67:43)
chance of getting Blitzle would be from (67:41 - 67:46)
field research Blitzle has like a weird (67:43 - 67:49)
collar thing on I don't know what it's (67:46 - 67:51)
called (67:49 - 67:52)
necklace (67:51 - 67:54)
um if you complete the The Collection (67:52 - 67:56)
challenge you will have an encounter (67:54 - 67:58)
with (67:56 - 67:58)
Dragonite uh oh and here the oh the the (67:59 - 68:02)
clothing's actually kind of good what (68:01 - 68:03)
the (68:02 - 68:07)
heck uh so clothing will be Gothita top (68:03 - 68:10)
Gothita pants oh sorry not Gothita gatel (68:07 - 68:14)
uh Gothel shoes reuni top reuni boots (68:10 - 68:18)
hooded denim jacket denim pants and then (68:14 - 68:20)
the Showcase will be either goita or (68:18 - 68:23)
Marini or the Showcase will just be (68:20 - 68:24)
random because it's been like two months (68:23 - 68:26)
and Niantic is just like the Showcase (68:24 - 68:27)
will be this and then last minute it's (68:26 - 68:30)
just Squirtle because I I don't know how (68:27 - 68:33)
it doesn't work I the like showcases are (68:30 - 68:35)
constantly like they couldn't figure out (68:33 - 68:36)
how to deal with Pokemon that had (68:35 - 68:39)
different forms so Wooper with the two (68:36 - 68:42)
different forms and growth with the two (68:39 - 68:44)
different forms they can't make that (68:42 - 68:46)
work for some (68:44 - 68:49)
reason also pump kaboo got canceled cuz (68:46 - 68:52)
that P has a bunch of different (68:49 - 68:56)
forms they yep so all all of their (68:52 - 68:58)
showcases yeah so like Wooper Community (68:56 - 69:01)
day was just Squirtle but Squirtle has (68:58 - 69:02)
different forms they has Squirtle and (69:01 - 69:04)
then Squirtle with glasses and Squirtle (69:02 - 69:06)
with a hat those aren't different (69:04 - 69:08)
Pokedex based forms though that's the (69:06 - 69:11)
same Pokemon with the same (69:08 - 69:14)
stats with a (69:11 - 69:18)
costume okay okay okay yeah that's (69:14 - 69:20)
that's slightly (69:18 - 69:20)
different and I do feel like they have (69:21 - 69:27)
leaned more into designing Avatar items (69:24 - 69:29)
in the last few (69:27 - 69:32)
events they had good Avatar items for (69:29 - 69:34)
the Halloween event they have at least (69:32 - 69:36)
very thorough Avatar items for this (69:34 - 69:37)
event and they had a couple of good (69:36 - 69:41)
shirts for the Tali Festival of Lights (69:37 - 69:43)
event well because you can actually see (69:41 - 69:45)
them (69:43 - 69:47)
now this game needs an entire character (69:45 - 69:50)
redesign I mean yeah I thought it was (69:47 - 69:55)
going to happen I you know yeah but then (69:50 - 69:57)
some oddd people got laid off so that's (69:55 - 70:00)
not going to happen anytime (69:57 - 70:00)
soon uh yeah I you know I I thought (70:01 - 70:09)
there was a character redesign coming (70:05 - 70:12)
but you know (70:09 - 70:14)
uh Party play probably brought more (70:12 - 70:17)
people back into the I don't know I'm (70:14 - 70:18)
just making things (70:17 - 70:23)
up usually in games new features bring (70:18 - 70:25)
more people in then (70:23 - 70:27)
fixing (70:25 - 70:30)
existing things in the game cuz new (70:27 - 70:32)
features sound way cooler (70:30 - 70:35)
than we fixed that one bug that four (70:32 - 70:38)
people (70:35 - 70:38)
had unless the bug is ruining everyone's (70:38 - 70:43)
gameplay which there are just a lot of (70:41 - 70:46)
bugs so it's not one bug I can't wait (70:43 - 70:48)
for summer of 2025 when collection or (70:46 - 70:51)
when showcases are finally fixed and you (70:48 - 70:53)
can put Whooper in properly and routes (70:51 - 70:55)
are finally fixed and Party Place (70:53 - 70:57)
finally (70:55 - 70:57)
fixed not me trying to follow my own (70:58 - 71:03)
route I created and it not picking it up (71:01 - 71:05)
and me having to walk back 10 minutes to (71:03 - 71:06)
restart (71:05 - 71:08)
it that was a fun (71:06 - 71:10)
experience all right well we'll be back (71:08 - 71:13)

news in regards to scarlet and violet (71:16 - 71:22)
uh or if they don't do Eevee for (71:20 - 71:24)
whatever reason I would ass assume that (71:22 - 71:27)
it would be Sam samarat or maybe they do (71:24 - 71:30)
Eevee and samur I don't know they (71:27 - 71:33)
anything samarat wearing an Eevee hoodie (71:30 - 71:35)
