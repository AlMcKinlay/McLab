[Music] (0:13 - 0:20)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:27)
575th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:27 - 0:33)
with me is Hannah I have been getting a (0:30 - 0:37)
solid amount of sleep in Pokemon sleep (0:33 - 0:40)
so I'm not as tired this week I think (0:37 - 0:42)
placebo (0:40 - 0:45)
well we'll talk about it Placebo sleep (0:42 - 0:46)
effect (0:45 - 0:49)
Greg is also here I am also here I beat (0:46 - 0:50)
the game (0:49 - 0:52)
Pokemon sleep I got 100. so there's (0:50 - 0:54)
nowhere else to go (0:52 - 0:57)
it was a fun week (0:54 - 0:58)
um (0:57 - 1:03)
the first two days 92 or 93 get on my (0:58 - 1:07)
level because I got a perfect hundred (1:03 - 1:07)
I'm gonna spoil something Greg it's it's (1:07 - 1:11)
not that hard to kill (1:09 - 1:12)
did you do it (1:11 - 1:17)
yeah three days in a row lies (1:12 - 1:19)
you just have to get more than eight and (1:17 - 1:21)
a half hours of sleep that's it that's (1:19 - 1:24)
all you gotta do that's all you gotta do (1:21 - 1:27)
even if you're like not sleeping (1:24 - 1:31)
it counts yeah I guess okay before we I (1:27 - 1:32)
we have Pokemon sleep we're gonna talk (1:31 - 1:34)
about that first uh (1:32 - 1:37)
there's some Japan drama we're gonna (1:34 - 1:39)
talk about that uh yeah there it is (1:37 - 1:42)
Comic-Con drama (1:39 - 1:45)
and then two new things launched roots (1:42 - 1:50)
and Mewtwo in separate games unite drama (1:45 - 1:53)
uh I don't you sure yeah there's always (1:50 - 1:54)
unite drama you guys are always mad (1:53 - 1:57)
about like they'll add like a two dollar (1:54 - 1:58)
skin you guys would be mad about that (1:57 - 1:59)
too (1:58 - 2:01)
like it should have been 99 Cents I (1:59 - 2:03)
should have been 99 so start with me you (2:01 - 2:05)
get bet I watch your streams you're bad (2:03 - 2:07)
all the time that's true that's true (2:05 - 2:11)
yeah yeah yeah yeah very true um (2:07 - 2:13)
uh well I guess it depends so for (2:11 - 2:16)
Pokemon sleep it's out it's here I think (2:13 - 2:18)
we've had it for what like five days (2:16 - 2:20)
I'll open the app because I gotta look (2:18 - 2:21)
at it (2:20 - 2:22)
um (2:21 - 2:24)
it's pretty easy to get a hundred (2:22 - 2:27)
because they're basing 100 off of 8.5 (2:24 - 2:31)
hours of sleep and it doesn't matter how (2:27 - 2:34)
many like little lines that pop up as (2:31 - 2:35)
long as you did it for eight and a half (2:34 - 2:38)
hours you're getting 100. you're solid (2:35 - 2:39)
you're golden (2:38 - 2:42)
but I don't stay in bed that long I (2:39 - 2:44)
don't I have too many things to do see (2:42 - 2:47)
that is how you are cheating your score (2:44 - 2:50)
you just need to lie there and plan your (2:47 - 2:53)
day and do not move (2:50 - 2:56)
correct you need to add an hour of tick (2:53 - 2:58)
tock before bed an hour of tick tock (2:56 - 3:01)
after bed you can also add a nap in the (2:58 - 3:03)
middle of the day and that adds to your (3:01 - 3:05)
score I have not done it yet but that's (3:03 - 3:08)
what I was gonna say that's uh so if (3:05 - 3:12)
it's 8.5 hours for your entire day so (3:08 - 3:15)
like there it was two days ago I think I (3:12 - 3:16)
slept (3:15 - 3:20)
like six and a half hours (3:16 - 3:24)
and it was like whatever 83 or 84 or (3:20 - 3:26)
something and then I did a two hour nap (3:24 - 3:29)
and then it changed my score to 100 but (3:26 - 3:32)
it shows like two little blocks (3:29 - 3:35)
okay on the on the graph (3:32 - 3:37)
so if you're I guess if you're dedicated (3:35 - 3:40)
to getting 100 every day for really no (3:37 - 3:43)
reason I'm not listening (3:40 - 3:46)
[Music] (3:43 - 3:46)
every day those are the people who are (3:46 - 3:50)
setting it up to say you're sleeping (3:48 - 3:52)
when you're not actually sleeping yeah (3:50 - 3:55)
well like it's very easy to do the 100 (3:52 - 3:57)
that I got like (3:55 - 4:00)
yeah it doesn't matter but (3:57 - 4:04)
it's cool that it adds a nap on to yeah (4:00 - 4:05)
that's what I was curious about is like (4:04 - 4:08)
if they're looking for a hundred and I (4:05 - 4:09)
sleep like seven hours and then I nap (4:08 - 4:11)
for 90 minutes isn't gonna add those (4:09 - 4:14)
together and it does which I think (4:11 - 4:16)
it should I don't know yeah it makes (4:14 - 4:18)
sense it makes sense given how people (4:16 - 4:19)
don't (4:18 - 4:22)
a lot of people don't sleep in one solid (4:19 - 4:24)
block like there's a huge part of the (4:22 - 4:26)
population that sleeps in multiple (4:24 - 4:27)
blocks (4:26 - 4:29)
they say it's only two (4:27 - 4:33)
okay they're they're making choices with (4:29 - 4:35)
what they decided if we're just gonna (4:33 - 4:36)
say sure (4:35 - 4:38)
We're not gonna fight them too hard on (4:36 - 4:39)
them (4:38 - 4:42)
literally there so you don't like cheat (4:39 - 4:45)
the game (4:42 - 4:45)
it's not a game it's like there are a (4:47 - 4:51)
ton of people who who've been getting (4:50 - 4:54)
the error and haven't had their sleep (4:51 - 4:56)
tracked properly and then there's say I (4:54 - 4:57)
I still want to play this game today I'm (4:56 - 4:58)
just gonna say I'm sleeping for an hour (4:57 - 5:00)
and a half even if I'm just awakened (4:58 - 5:02)
doing stuff yeah that's true like if (5:00 - 5:03)
you're a person that doesn't believe in (5:02 - 5:07)
naps there's nothing stopping you I know (5:03 - 5:08)
that I know there are people that don't (5:07 - 5:09)
nap at all (5:08 - 5:11)
I used to be that person I've converted (5:09 - 5:14)
to naps are one of the greatest things (5:11 - 5:17)
ever made a spoiler alert as you get (5:14 - 5:20)
older naps become far more important to (5:17 - 5:23)
your life is is they are important when (5:20 - 5:25)
you're a baby and they get way more (5:23 - 5:27)
important as you get older (5:25 - 5:29)
I'm not making it through this day awake (5:27 - 5:31)
are you kidding it's like a I think it's (5:29 - 5:33)
like the nine to five thing that killed (5:31 - 5:36)
me of like just like you have to be (5:33 - 5:38)
there be focused for eight hours and (5:36 - 5:40)
like work the entire time and then like (5:38 - 5:42)
go home and then like there now you can (5:40 - 5:44)
like make dinner and have your hobbies (5:42 - 5:45)
where (5:44 - 5:47)
when I switched like a work at home (5:45 - 5:50)
lifestyle (5:47 - 5:52)
and I was like man I just cannot focus (5:50 - 5:54)
right now I just I I just don't have any (5:52 - 5:56)
Creative Energy I just don't know what (5:54 - 5:57)
to do right now and then I would nap and (5:56 - 5:59)
then I would wake up and bust out so (5:57 - 6:02)
much homework we had we had nap rooms at (5:59 - 6:05)
work we had specific nap rooms to deal (6:02 - 6:07)
with that fact that around one o'clock (6:05 - 6:10)
two o'clock people are like oh I'm done (6:07 - 6:13)
I need a nap (6:10 - 6:13)
no I believe in naps (6:14 - 6:18)
um (6:16 - 6:20)
yeah like so if you're not a napper you (6:18 - 6:22)
could just tell the game you're you're (6:20 - 6:24)
sleeping like nothing is going to stop (6:22 - 6:26)
you from doing that I don't want to do (6:24 - 6:28)
that though I want to be truthful to (6:26 - 6:31)
Pokemon sleep (6:28 - 6:33)
I want it to have the correct as correct (6:31 - 6:37)
numbers as it can the K phrases there as (6:33 - 6:39)
it can because it's not yep snack great (6:37 - 6:41)
it's not they're already alive yeah mine (6:39 - 6:43)
already messed up they already lost me (6:41 - 6:45)
when it messed up it's literally said I (6:43 - 6:47)
slept two eight hour sections on (6:45 - 6:48)
Wednesday (6:47 - 6:51)
both on Wednesday I'm like how okay one (6:48 - 6:53)
of those was Thursday (6:51 - 6:56)
then Friday it decided no I'm just not (6:53 - 7:00)
on I no whatever that was didn't happen (6:56 - 7:02)
I crashed or did something or shut (7:00 - 7:04)
myself off I don't know didn't account (7:02 - 7:05)
and there were a lot of people who have (7:04 - 7:08)
been having their entire sleep just not (7:05 - 7:11)
counted yeah or I'm gonna count four or (7:08 - 7:15)
four minutes of that like what dude (7:11 - 7:15)
you're not even doing anything you're (7:15 - 7:20)
literally just sitting like how long did (7:18 - 7:23)
you have me on my face and not bounce (7:20 - 7:25)
around I'm like (7:23 - 7:29)
there's just it's fine right like it's a (7:25 - 7:31)
and you know it's a it's a new app yeah (7:29 - 7:33)
but it's also and it's mostly really (7:31 - 7:35)
great but it's not tracking super well (7:33 - 7:37)
it's not right it is mostly nothing (7:35 - 7:40)
burger like there's nothing it's like we (7:37 - 7:43)
stole ideas from snap we stole ideas (7:40 - 7:46)
from Pokemon jump Magikarp jump we still (7:43 - 7:51)
have ideas from camping in a houses from (7:46 - 7:53)
their own games (7:51 - 7:53)
I'm enjoying it I'm actually I am more (7:54 - 8:00)
than neutral I am I'm more positive than (7:58 - 8:01)
neutral on this app (8:00 - 8:04)
it's just a pleasant thing to look at in (8:01 - 8:06)
the morning instead of opening up my (8:04 - 8:08)
phone and doom scrolling so that's (8:06 - 8:10)
actually made my mornings more positive (8:08 - 8:15)
quickly sliding into Pikmin walk for me (8:10 - 8:18)
where I already am like (8:15 - 8:22)
why are you why are you making me do (8:18 - 8:24)
anything right away in the morning I (8:22 - 8:25)
don't want to interact with you right (8:24 - 8:28)
now but I have I love that I'm with hand (8:25 - 8:32)
on this and then two I'm like okay well (8:28 - 8:35)
that was five minutes and whatever like (8:32 - 8:37)
why don't that's all I need I don't care (8:35 - 8:39)
anymore and it's quickly slotted into (8:37 - 8:41)
the I don't really care about this (8:39 - 8:43)
because I don't (8:41 - 8:47)
it's not helping me improve my sleep (8:43 - 8:50)
so it's not accurate enough for me to (8:47 - 8:54)
really glean any great insights from it (8:50 - 8:55)
um (8:54 - 8:57)
and it's just like once I'm in there I'm (8:55 - 8:59)
like I guess I get some berries and I (8:57 - 9:02)
touch some things and then whatever you (8:59 - 9:03)
get to see if there are shiny Pokemon (9:02 - 9:05)
you get to see if there are Pokemon you (9:03 - 9:07)
like it has Hoenn Pokemon it could have (9:05 - 9:09)
Rosalia it could I haven't seen it yet (9:07 - 9:12)
but again I'm not much of a collector of (9:09 - 9:13)
like I've collected these things a (9:12 - 9:15)
thousand times in different ways I can't (9:13 - 9:18)
put them in luxury balls I can't move (9:15 - 9:19)
them anywhere they are just sitting (9:18 - 9:23)
there which is fine like it's not (9:19 - 9:26)
it's not interesting enough for me to (9:23 - 9:28)
think I really want to do this it's not (9:26 - 9:30)
a hassle enough for me to actively hate (9:28 - 9:34)
it it's just sliding down in the I do I (9:30 - 9:38)
want to spend my time (9:34 - 9:40)
dealing with this right now and (9:38 - 9:43)
generally long time though nah even (9:40 - 9:45)
though it's not a lot of time it's like (9:43 - 9:48)
okay I guess it's definitely not a game (9:45 - 9:50)
for everyone I have seen people be (9:48 - 9:52)
really annoyed with it some for very (9:50 - 9:54)
valid reasons because the sleep isn't (9:52 - 9:56)
getting tracked properly because you can (9:54 - 9:59)
roll over on your go plus plus way too (9:56 - 10:00)
easily I still don't have my go plus (9:59 - 10:03)
plus no clue that's unfortunate (10:00 - 10:05)
oh that's why I was going to ask Greg if (10:03 - 10:07)
you were using the go plus plus to track (10:05 - 10:09)
your sleep that messed up because I had (10:07 - 10:12)
a similar issue to you the app came out (10:09 - 10:14)
on Wednesday if I remember Wednesday in (10:12 - 10:15)
the US Wednesday (10:14 - 10:19)
and I don't go to bed till like 4 A.M (10:15 - 10:21)
it's my normal bedtime so realistically (10:19 - 10:23)
the first day I get to do it is Thursday (10:21 - 10:27)
at 4 00 a.m 4 a.m right like I'm not (10:23 - 10:29)
going to bed Wednesday night I'm going (10:27 - 10:31)
to bed Thursday morning for whatever (10:29 - 10:34)
reason it worked and then all of a (10:31 - 10:37)
sudden it changed my sleep data so it's (10:34 - 10:40)
now it now said I slept a 94 on (10:37 - 10:43)
Wednesday which is not true I went to (10:40 - 10:46)
sleep on Thursday and then it said I (10:43 - 10:49)
slept at 25 on Thursday (10:46 - 10:53)
which I only slept once on Thursday that (10:49 - 10:56)
was at four in the morning to noon (10:53 - 11:01)
so I I my my maybe my my theory is I (10:56 - 11:03)
accidentally pressed the Pikachu and it (11:01 - 11:05)
started sleeping because I had it in my (11:03 - 11:08)
pocket yeah it keeps turning on in my (11:05 - 11:10)
bag and yeah I I keep the lullaby sound (11:08 - 11:12)
on so that I can hear when it (11:10 - 11:15)
accidentally turns on in my bag they've (11:12 - 11:16)
made it way too easy to accidentally (11:15 - 11:19)
click the button yeah well ideally the (11:16 - 11:21)
the the Pikachu is so in order to start (11:19 - 11:24)
the lullaby your device needs to be flat (11:21 - 11:27)
if you start it sideways It'll like beep (11:24 - 11:30)
at you it'll like it'll flash red but (11:27 - 11:32)
like because I wear hoodies I'll slide (11:30 - 11:34)
it in my hoodie pocket and then if I put (11:32 - 11:37)
my seatbelt on that's flat enough for it (11:34 - 11:39)
so now I have to like consciously like (11:37 - 11:41)
oh wait I gotta make sure nothing's (11:39 - 11:43)
touching this because otherwise it's (11:41 - 11:45)
gonna think I'll sleep in a solid (11:43 - 11:47)
product but even so so I'm assuming that (11:45 - 11:49)
I like started the lullaby for like 90 (11:47 - 11:52)
or 20 90 minutes or two hours and that's (11:49 - 11:55)
why that second part showed up but why (11:52 - 11:57)
did the first part of me sleeping (11:55 - 12:00)
Thursday from 4am to noon go back to (11:57 - 12:02)
Wednesday it's worked fine since I've (12:00 - 12:06)
got like I have a 94 25 100 100 100 and (12:02 - 12:08)
this one of the hundreds was because I (12:06 - 12:09)
slept twice (12:08 - 12:10)
um (12:09 - 12:12)
but (12:10 - 12:14)
yeah I mean like (12:12 - 12:15)
there was a point of me of like can I go (12:14 - 12:17)
back can I delete this data because it's (12:15 - 12:19)
like technically not right can I like (12:17 - 12:22)
manually adjust it and you can't pay for (12:19 - 12:25)
that you can do that with the premium (12:22 - 12:28)
subscription but only within the last 24 (12:25 - 12:33)
hours so I noticed it 26 hours later Get (12:28 - 12:37)
Wrecked so I couldn't adjust it (12:33 - 12:38)
um (12:37 - 12:41)
that's one of the uh uh you guys are (12:38 - 12:44)
both free right oh yeah oh yeah like (12:41 - 12:47)
no free like you didn't even do the free (12:44 - 12:48)
trial you're like no no okay because (12:47 - 12:52)
that you get the 14 day free trial I (12:48 - 12:54)
looked at it and it said what (12:52 - 12:57)
exactly what I be getting for ten (12:54 - 13:00)
dollars a month not I wanted to learn (12:57 - 13:02)
the game first and then decide if I (13:00 - 13:03)
wanted the free trial (13:02 - 13:05)
that makes sense because like once once (13:03 - 13:07)
you only get the free trial once right (13:05 - 13:09)
so yeah (13:07 - 13:11)
um (13:09 - 13:16)
the here's the as a sleeping app (13:11 - 13:19)
Pokemon sleep is bad yeah like it it's (13:16 - 13:23)
it's not doing anything that you Greg is (13:19 - 13:25)
right here although I just I like the (13:23 - 13:27)
game I will be I I think it's really (13:25 - 13:29)
enjoyable I like checking it before I go (13:27 - 13:32)
to bed I love checking it when I wake up (13:29 - 13:35)
my cat is having a field day behind me (13:32 - 13:38)
I like checking it a couple times (13:35 - 13:40)
throughout the day it is very (13:38 - 13:41)
I don't think Greg's wrong it's very (13:40 - 13:44)
Pikmin blue you can do very little in (13:41 - 13:46)
the app but like you know you're (13:44 - 13:48)
supposed to be doing a specific thing in (13:46 - 13:49)
this game it's sleeping in Pikmin Bloom (13:48 - 13:52)
it is turn it on start walking when (13:49 - 13:54)
you're done walking you go oh that's how (13:52 - 13:58)
much I walked the gist of both of those (13:54 - 14:01)
caves I will say it's a bad sleep (13:58 - 14:03)
tracker I won't necessarily say it's a (14:01 - 14:06)
bad sleep app it is actually helping me (14:03 - 14:09)
with my sleep right now as long as they (14:06 - 14:13)
fix their big time bug soon because so (14:09 - 14:15)
far I have been motivated to go to bed (14:13 - 14:17)
on time but I'm not getting the credit (14:15 - 14:21)
for it because their time is an hour off (14:17 - 14:24)
everything in the game happens an hour (14:21 - 14:25)
off (14:24 - 14:27)
of what the actual clock is I don't (14:25 - 14:29)
actually have that issue like mine is (14:27 - 14:32)
synced up where I'm having the correct (14:29 - 14:35)
time except if I look at (14:32 - 14:39)
what it's saying for the data the data (14:35 - 14:41)
is off but like it (14:39 - 14:43)
the alarm goes off at the right time it (14:41 - 14:45)
says I'm in bed at the right time but (14:43 - 14:47)
when it records the data the data is (14:45 - 14:49)
wildly off that's why I have two (14:47 - 14:51)
Wednesdays (14:49 - 14:54)
like I don't know what it's doing I (14:51 - 14:57)
don't understand how between what it's (14:54 - 14:59)
saying to me on the surface of my phone (14:57 - 15:01)
and I'm looking at the app to after I'm (14:59 - 15:03)
done and running the report and it's (15:01 - 15:06)
wildly off but also all my breakfast (15:03 - 15:08)
times are all right like I've gone in (15:06 - 15:11)
and said this is it's the right time (15:08 - 15:13)
it's not I don't have to wait till seven (15:11 - 15:16)
like there's something weird happening (15:13 - 15:18)
not with everybody because I don't have (15:16 - 15:20)
the issues that everybody else has (15:18 - 15:22)
except for when it's recording the data (15:20 - 15:24)
and then I'm like that is not how that (15:22 - 15:27)
happened at all (15:24 - 15:27)
that's wild I I only I only had that one (15:27 - 15:33)
issue that I talked about (15:31 - 15:36)
like I forgot that I had the Google (15:33 - 15:38)
sleep (15:36 - 15:41)
app thingy I've had it for like two (15:38 - 15:43)
years it's been recording my sleep data (15:41 - 15:45)
for two years I just realized I had it (15:43 - 15:47)
like two weeks ago on this show when I (15:45 - 15:49)
brought it up because I've tried I've (15:47 - 15:50)
tried to sleep with a Fitbit I've tried (15:49 - 15:52)
to sleep with the Apple watch I've tried (15:50 - 15:53)
to sleep with the thing that goes on (15:52 - 15:54)
your like underwear it's like a little (15:53 - 15:56)
like Pebble thing that goes on your (15:54 - 15:57)
underwear it's supposed to be like your (15:56 - 15:59)
waistband but (15:57 - 16:02)
you would put it on your boxers or your (15:59 - 16:03)
boxer briefs or your (16:02 - 16:05)
tried that (16:03 - 16:07)
um I tried the like a Kickstarter thing (16:05 - 16:09)
that was like a scrunchie that you would (16:07 - 16:11)
put around your forearm that thing (16:09 - 16:14)
started on fire they had to recall it (16:11 - 16:16)
um but the okay so everyone knows that (16:14 - 16:18)
Google makes like these little displays (16:16 - 16:20)
the little Google homes (16:18 - 16:24)
they made one for the bed and it uses (16:20 - 16:26)
like it there's a camera up there but (16:24 - 16:27)
it's not a real camera it's like an (16:26 - 16:29)
infrared camera (16:27 - 16:31)
um (16:29 - 16:31)
that's a real camera it's just not (16:33 - 16:38)
recording video footage it's still a (16:35 - 16:40)
real camera if you're gonna get on me (16:38 - 16:41)
about other things about being real (16:40 - 16:43)
we're gonna that is a real camera you (16:41 - 16:45)
can't like FaceTime on that camera like (16:43 - 16:49)
you can video the camera look real weird (16:45 - 16:53)
so it's supposed to like sense you (16:49 - 16:54)
getting in bed and then watching you and (16:53 - 16:56)
then obviously that thing has (16:54 - 16:58)
microphones so I can compare that (16:56 - 17:00)
directly with Pokemon sleep and so on (16:58 - 17:03)
Thursday where Pokemon sleep said I had (17:00 - 17:06)
100 because I was in bed for eight I was (17:03 - 17:08)
literally in bed eight hours and 31 (17:06 - 17:09)
minutes (17:08 - 17:11)
anyways (17:09 - 17:13)
it's like 100 percent (17:11 - 17:15)
and it gave me a hundred percent so I (17:13 - 17:17)
think I think like a normal person who's (17:15 - 17:19)
maybe never done a sleep app was like oh (17:17 - 17:21)
I got 100 this is the best I can sleep (17:19 - 17:22)
right because I feel like that's what (17:21 - 17:24)
it's like insinuating even though it (17:22 - 17:27)
might like that that would be if I know (17:24 - 17:29)
nothing about sleeping it's giving me (17:27 - 17:31)
100 it would be like oh you passed you (17:29 - 17:34)
you graduated congratulations (17:31 - 17:36)
so my Google sleep gives me way more (17:34 - 17:38)
data again I don't do anything I don't (17:36 - 17:39)
set it I don't tell it that I'm sleeping (17:38 - 17:40)
I don't tell that I wake up it's just (17:39 - 17:42)
been doing this for two years it says I (17:40 - 17:45)
was actually only asleep five hours and (17:42 - 17:46)
52 minutes (17:45 - 17:49)
I was in bed for eight hours and one (17:46 - 17:52)
minute which at one point I'm out of bed (17:49 - 17:54)
for probably 20 minutes I think I got up (17:52 - 17:56)
I went to the bathroom I like switched (17:54 - 17:58)
out some laundry in the middle of the (17:56 - 17:58)
night (17:58 - 18:01)
I probably made some pies Cosmic I got (17:58 - 18:03)
like a cosmic brownie you know so it (18:01 - 18:05)
took an account that I left the bed (18:03 - 18:07)
Pokemon sleep does not do that no yeah (18:05 - 18:09)
it just keeps saying it keeps thinking (18:07 - 18:11)
you're in bed it said my efficiency was (18:09 - 18:17)
a 73 I got in bed at 3 44 a.m I got I (18:11 - 18:20)
woke I got out of bed at 12 12 p.m so (18:17 - 18:22)
about eight hours so that's close to (18:20 - 18:25)
what Pokemon sleep said (18:22 - 18:26)
um (18:25 - 18:27)
it said I fell asleep within a couple (18:26 - 18:30)
minutes uh when I woke up I technically (18:27 - 18:32)
stayed in bed for 42 minutes and then it (18:30 - 18:34)
has I I can keep going it has way more (18:32 - 18:37)
data I can keep going like yeah I mean (18:34 - 18:40)
yeah this thing was a hundred and twenty (18:37 - 18:42)
nine dollars or so I'm sure it was like (18:40 - 18:44)
I'm sure I got it on sale but like it (18:42 - 18:47)
gave me so much more data than the 55 (18:44 - 18:49)
dollar (18:47 - 18:51)
Pokeball plus thing I mean you can use (18:49 - 18:52)
your phone for free but it's getting the (18:51 - 18:54)
same data it's not like the Pokeball (18:52 - 18:56)
plus plus has more advantage that being (18:54 - 18:58)
said I like the game I I think the game (18:56 - 19:00)
part is good I am saying that the Sleep (18:58 - 19:05)
part is so yeah nothing yeah (19:00 - 19:09)
sleep-based decisions off of this app do (19:05 - 19:12)
not this app is telling you nothing and (19:09 - 19:14)
as far as I can tell the graph that it (19:12 - 19:16)
gives you after it's like AI generated (19:14 - 19:19)
like you're up and down and I'm like not (19:16 - 19:22)
great it's not (19:19 - 19:26)
random it does have an algorithm that (19:22 - 19:30)
tries to kind of fit your sleep to the (19:26 - 19:32)
way that people generally sleep which is (19:30 - 19:34)
in the earlier parts of the night you're (19:32 - 19:35)
supposed to be getting more deep sleep (19:34 - 19:36)
in the later parts of the night you're (19:35 - 19:38)
supposed to be getting more REM sleep (19:36 - 19:40)
and it kind of trends that way it's not (19:38 - 19:42)
a great graph nah so I am the opposite (19:40 - 19:45)
of Steve I have the Apple watch and I (19:42 - 19:47)
have the aura ring so I do wear trackers (19:45 - 19:49)
on me when I sleep a lot of the time and (19:47 - 19:52)
I have also been comparing and yes the (19:49 - 19:55)
plus plus is not a great tracker if you (19:52 - 19:57)
don't have anything making a ton of (19:55 - 20:00)
sound making a ton of movement in your (19:57 - 20:02)
bed then the plus plus is going to (20:00 - 20:05)
overestimate how much you sleep if you (20:02 - 20:07)
have other things making a bunch of (20:05 - 20:10)
sound or other beings or animals moving (20:07 - 20:11)
around a whole lot then it's probably (20:10 - 20:14)
gonna underestimate how much you sleep (20:11 - 20:15)
but maybe not by much because it doesn't (20:14 - 20:18)
seem to be really that sensitive no (20:15 - 20:20)
though it does seem like when you are (20:18 - 20:23)
using the phone app for Pokemon sleep (20:20 - 20:25)
and not the plus plus it will (20:23 - 20:27)
underestimate the amount of sleep if you (20:25 - 20:30)
have any sort of noise going on but it (20:27 - 20:32)
really picks up on the noise no no they (20:30 - 20:36)
might no but dogs wander around can you (20:32 - 20:38)
literally sat on my phone because he (20:36 - 20:39)
wanted to be on my head and of course (20:38 - 20:41)
this has to be by my head so he's (20:39 - 20:44)
literally sitting on the phone and my (20:41 - 20:45)
buddy (20:44 - 20:47)
nah we're not doing this and you get (20:45 - 20:51)
real mad but it (20:47 - 20:51)
it's it's a game it is not a sleep (20:52 - 20:58)
tracker and people really I mean this is (20:56 - 21:00)
this is this is what they told me at the (20:58 - 21:02)
the thing they said it is it is a game (21:00 - 21:05)
that encourages encourages you creating (21:02 - 21:10)
healthy habits yes do not make decisions (21:05 - 21:10)
it isn't telling you (21:11 - 21:16)
much of anything what was the thing that (21:14 - 21:17)
made me laugh (21:16 - 21:20)
this last time I did it (21:17 - 21:23)
yeah like how it decides how much time I (21:20 - 21:27)
was dozing snoozing and slumbering yeah (21:23 - 21:29)
really because (21:27 - 21:31)
um well the slumbering is supposed to be (21:29 - 21:32)
the REM (21:31 - 21:35)
you have me never know (21:32 - 21:39)
uh sumbering which not true it's got two (21:35 - 21:43)
percent I I was snoozing 69 percent of (21:39 - 21:44)
the time nice (21:43 - 21:47)
a dozing 29 of the time so I decided (21:44 - 21:49)
that I was the dozing type this time and (21:47 - 21:51)
I'm like I literally did not sleep any (21:49 - 21:55)
different than uh the night before uh (21:51 - 21:59)
which I uh was slumbering 36 of the time (21:55 - 22:02)
so again your AI seed for Saturday was (21:59 - 22:07)
much different than the one you did uh (22:02 - 22:10)
uh before that it it yeah it's just like (22:07 - 22:11)
um (22:10 - 22:14)
yeah you're just guessing these are (22:11 - 22:16)
these are not good (22:14 - 22:18)
these are not good graphs I'm looking at (22:16 - 22:20)
the difference between Pokemon sleep (22:18 - 22:23)
scrap and my aura ring graph (22:20 - 22:24)
and (22:23 - 22:27)
is is the aura ring the one you pay uh (22:24 - 22:30)
like six bucks a month for yeah I've had (22:27 - 22:31)
it long enough that I'm past the free (22:30 - 22:34)
trial on that (22:31 - 22:34)
and the the I mean I I listed off a (22:34 - 22:40)
bunch of numbers for my Google app that (22:38 - 22:43)
I like barely look at uh is it equal (22:40 - 22:46)
amount of numbers it is giving you it is (22:43 - 22:48)
way more amount of numbers that it is (22:46 - 22:50)
giving me one of the reasons I do pay (22:48 - 22:52)
for the aura ring is because it tracks (22:50 - 22:54)
things like my temperature and my heart (22:52 - 22:56)
rate throughout the night and that that (22:54 - 22:58)
gives me more information about even if (22:56 - 23:00)
I slept a long time it gives me more (22:58 - 23:02)
information about things going on in my (23:00 - 23:04)
body that could relate to why I still (23:02 - 23:06)
don't feel great even if I slept for (23:04 - 23:09)
eight hours and the ring tracks that and (23:06 - 23:11)
there is no way the plus plus could do (23:09 - 23:11)
that (23:11 - 23:15)
no at all (23:11 - 23:18)
I mean there are plenty of (23:15 - 23:20)
sleep apps in the App Store (23:18 - 23:22)
um I I went through them I don't know if (23:20 - 23:24)
we talked about them on the podcast or (23:22 - 23:26)
if that was just twitch stream but three (23:24 - 23:30)
of the five sleep at top sleep apps in (23:26 - 23:32)
the App Store are sixty dollars a year (23:30 - 23:33)
yeah (23:32 - 23:36)
um and then the and I think the number (23:33 - 23:38)
one sleep app is fifty dollars a year I (23:36 - 23:40)
don't remember what it's called and then (23:38 - 23:42)
there was one that was 70 a year so (23:40 - 23:45)
Pokemon sleep charging a hundred dollars (23:42 - 23:50)
a year for part of it having a very I (23:45 - 23:53)
would say less than mediocre sleep (23:50 - 23:54)
tracking (23:53 - 23:56)
feature (23:54 - 23:59)
um it's like okay like (23:56 - 24:02)
that doesn't come close to the 50 a year (23:59 - 24:04)
60 a year kind of stuff so what about (24:02 - 24:07)
the game part and the game part is good (24:04 - 24:10)
but it's really hard to justify (24:07 - 24:13)
ten dollars a year for this kind of game (24:10 - 24:16)
even though like (24:13 - 24:18)
I think what hurts it maybe not what not (24:16 - 24:20)
hurts it (24:18 - 24:22)
you can do the almost the same exact (24:20 - 24:25)
stuff for free like the game is very (24:22 - 24:28)
playable without spending any money yeah (24:25 - 24:30)
um (24:28 - 24:33)
and so like (24:30 - 24:35)
the (24:33 - 24:38)
the spending money that I'm doing I I (24:35 - 24:42)
I'm on the free trial for the record (24:38 - 24:42)
like it all all it's really doing is (24:43 - 24:52)
it's doing a couple things number one it (24:49 - 24:54)
is it is giving you that premium biscuit (24:52 - 24:56)
so that premium biscuit is pretty much (24:54 - 25:01)
guaranteeing you a catch a session (24:56 - 25:02)
uh because I think the premium biscuit (25:01 - 25:05)
gives like plus like I gave it to a (25:02 - 25:07)
Spiel this morning and it said plus 12 (25:05 - 25:09)
even though this feel only needed five (25:07 - 25:11)
well (25:09 - 25:12)
um (25:11 - 25:14)
and then you're so you're getting a (25:12 - 25:15)
premium biscuit you're getting 100 extra (25:14 - 25:17)
points you can use those points to buy (25:15 - 25:20)
more biscuits right or like tents or (25:17 - 25:22)
incense or whatever (25:20 - 25:23)
um (25:22 - 25:26)
you're getting a good camp ticket once a (25:23 - 25:28)
month which is a 10 purchase on its own (25:26 - 25:31)
so I guess if you were going to buy the (25:28 - 25:34)
good camp ticket for ten dollars in the (25:31 - 25:36)
store you might as well just get a month (25:34 - 25:38)
of Premium because they're the same (25:36 - 25:39)
price (25:38 - 25:42)
uh and then we're in three months you're (25:39 - 25:44)
supposed to get the very elusive special (25:42 - 25:47)
rewards which I I don't know what they (25:44 - 25:49)
do the prices in this game are absurd (25:47 - 25:50)
yep (25:49 - 25:53)
it's not just the subscription price the (25:50 - 25:55)
the box that you can buy in the store (25:53 - 25:59)
like the the beginning release bundle is (25:55 - 26:03)
fifty dollars oh you better believe it (25:59 - 26:04)
is (26:03 - 26:05)
um (26:04 - 26:07)
yeah you so you get access to the (26:05 - 26:09)
premium store so in the premium store a (26:07 - 26:12)
poke biscuit is a hundred points and a (26:09 - 26:14)
great biscuit is 400 points and then if (26:12 - 26:17)
I was if I was like a regular person I (26:14 - 26:19)
can't even get a grape biscuit it's not (26:17 - 26:22)
available you you can only be premium to (26:19 - 26:24)
buy a grape biscuit if I wanted a pokey (26:22 - 26:27)
biscuit it would be 150. so it's it's 50 (26:24 - 26:31)
percent more because you're free (26:27 - 26:34)
um which is like whatever I guess (26:31 - 26:36)
uh the premium Exchange store only has (26:34 - 26:39)
Pokey biscuit grape biscuit handy candy (26:36 - 26:42)
medium dream cluster medium I have no (26:39 - 26:44)
clue what dream clusters do SUB skill (26:42 - 26:47)
seed and Main skill seed (26:44 - 26:48)
um (26:47 - 26:50)
and then of course you could buy like a (26:48 - 26:53)
master ball in the regular Exchange (26:50 - 26:54)
store (26:53 - 26:57)
uh so I feel like (26:54 - 27:01)
the hook of this game whether it's (26:57 - 27:03)
it's like the same that a lot of games (27:01 - 27:05)
use uses it's like the fear of missing (27:03 - 27:07)
out is (27:05 - 27:10)
you'll want to try to make sure that (27:07 - 27:12)
like if a shiny shows up or if your (27:10 - 27:14)
favorite Pokemon shows up you have (27:12 - 27:17)
enough biscuits to win them over because (27:14 - 27:19)
they're going to be gone if you don't (27:17 - 27:21)
take that opportunity it's (27:19 - 27:23)
it's buenos Pokemon shows up in the (27:21 - 27:25)
morning you can buy the biscuits that (27:23 - 27:26)
morning after UFC have seen a Pokemon (27:25 - 27:28)
and then just use them on that Pokemon (27:26 - 27:31)
you can buy them last minute (27:28 - 27:33)
yeah yeah yeah but like if you don't (27:31 - 27:34)
have like right now the reason that (27:33 - 27:36)
people have so many points is because (27:34 - 27:38)
they're running that promotion (27:36 - 27:40)
so you're getting what like 600 points a (27:38 - 27:43)
day for seven days and I'm getting an (27:40 - 27:44)
extra 100 points a day because I'm on (27:43 - 27:47)
the free trial so very quickly I have (27:44 - 27:48)
realized (27:47 - 27:50)
that (27:48 - 27:52)
that I'm not going to have this luxury (27:50 - 27:56)
of 700 extra like every day I could buy (27:52 - 27:58)
a great ball and like two Pokeballs and (27:56 - 28:00)
still have points left over (27:58 - 28:02)
I can't I'm not going to be able to do (28:00 - 28:03)
that like a great ball in the future is (28:02 - 28:07)
going to be 400 and if I'm if I'm maxing (28:03 - 28:09)
my sleep and I'm getting 100 points plus (28:07 - 28:12)
I'm getting 100 points for being a (28:09 - 28:14)
premium subscriber that's only 200 (28:12 - 28:16)
points a day and so I would have to (28:14 - 28:19)
perfectly sleep well not perfectly (28:16 - 28:20)
because you just (28:19 - 28:22)
whatever (28:20 - 28:24)
um I would have to do that two days in (28:22 - 28:26)
order to get a great ball and right now (28:24 - 28:27)
it's day five and I've gotten a great (28:26 - 28:29)
ball every day (28:27 - 28:31)
because they're giving me so many points (28:29 - 28:34)
so it's (28:31 - 28:37)
it feels like the game it feels like the (28:34 - 28:41)
game the game feels good because of the (28:37 - 28:45)
600 a day points that are coming but in (28:41 - 28:47)
a week I think a lot of people are going (28:45 - 28:50)
to fall off because the economy (28:47 - 28:51)
is actually going to become more (28:50 - 28:55)
realistic of like oh everything seemed a (28:51 - 28:56)
little more flexible because they were (28:55 - 28:59)
giving away 600 points a day and now (28:56 - 29:01)
that's barely bought anything I bought (28:59 - 29:04)
one Pokeball cookie one Pokeball biscuit (29:01 - 29:07)
and I'm still catching a Pokemon once a (29:04 - 29:09)
day oh I'm catching two Pokemon a day (29:07 - 29:11)
every day yeah but it's it's (29:09 - 29:14)
I don't know I don't feel a drive to (29:11 - 29:15)
need to catch as many Pokemon as (29:14 - 29:17)
possible in this game once a day I just (29:15 - 29:20)
think it's a pleasant little experience (29:17 - 29:23)
I I've caught one other one because it (29:20 - 29:24)
made me use my master ball cookie and (29:23 - 29:28)
that is all I've done yeah (29:24 - 29:30)
I I think though like like the the (29:28 - 29:31)
master ball cookie is a really good (29:30 - 29:32)
example because on the second day it (29:31 - 29:34)
makes you use it and I woke up and my (29:32 - 29:38)
only option was Slowpoke like no other (29:34 - 29:40)
Pokemon visited me even though my other (29:38 - 29:43)
option was a second Pikachu (29:40 - 29:46)
yeah because like the so the only other (29:43 - 29:47)
option the only option I had was (29:46 - 29:49)
Slowpoke and I slept really good so it (29:47 - 29:50)
was a bit of a bummer to wake up and be (29:49 - 29:53)
like Oh only one Pokemon visited me (29:50 - 29:55)
but then I'm also but then you also have (29:53 - 29:59)
a Pokemon that will be more hungry (29:55 - 30:02)
so when you give him the biscuit you're (29:59 - 30:05)
more likely to catch him (30:02 - 30:07)
but if that's not the Pokemon you want (30:05 - 30:09)
and then you don't have enough points (30:07 - 30:11)
like you guys always a guaranteed (30:09 - 30:13)
Pokemon that's more hungry I just got my (30:11 - 30:14)
first one today (30:13 - 30:16)
did you say there's always a guarantee (30:14 - 30:18)
no there is not yeah yeah it's not (30:16 - 30:21)
always guaranteed yeah yeah (30:18 - 30:23)
but you can tell like for those that (30:21 - 30:25)
maybe didn't read the rules of the game (30:23 - 30:27)
uh which was me for the first two days (30:25 - 30:30)
uh they have like little markers above (30:27 - 30:32)
them most of them are like four or five (30:30 - 30:35)
so a Pokeball is one of those markers (30:32 - 30:38)
and then a great ball is three (30:35 - 30:41)
of those there's no Ultra Ball in this (30:38 - 30:43)
Ultra biscuit in this game yeah (30:41 - 30:45)
but obviously the master balls uh the (30:43 - 30:48)
master Biscuit's 100 and then do you (30:45 - 30:50)
guys know how much you get for the free (30:48 - 30:51)
biscuit because I don't know what that (30:50 - 30:53)
is I only get oh it's three for the (30:51 - 30:54)
three yeah (30:53 - 30:58)
yeah so when I do the daily my premium (30:54 - 31:01)
biscuit it gave it nine it was it was (30:58 - 31:04)
three hearts of plus three plus three (31:01 - 31:08)
plus three yeah fancy ten dollar premium (31:04 - 31:09)
biscuit you know that's what's wrong (31:08 - 31:11)
with you Millennials is your avocado (31:09 - 31:13)
toast and your premium biscuits ruining (31:11 - 31:15)
the economy go to Applebee's the rest of (31:13 - 31:18)
us you do get a premium biscuit every (31:15 - 31:20)
day so it is pretty much like a plus (31:18 - 31:22)
three is not a guaranteed catch no no (31:20 - 31:24)
you could give it plus three and then (31:22 - 31:26)
you could give it a Pokeball and then it (31:24 - 31:28)
could decide that it's full and then you (31:26 - 31:30)
don't get to finish it off and that (31:28 - 31:33)
happened to me yesterday yeah but then I (31:30 - 31:34)
found the swab blue again today so I (31:33 - 31:37)
caught it did it remember that you gave (31:34 - 31:39)
it stuff before yes and actually two (31:37 - 31:41)
swablu appeared today when yesterday (31:39 - 31:43)
there had only been one but both of them (31:41 - 31:45)
had the progress I had made yesterday (31:43 - 31:48)
until I caught one of them so both had (31:45 - 31:51)
the progress yes so if you were trying (31:48 - 31:54)
to get which one you pay for before it's (31:51 - 31:57)
like put a put a value in the small blue (31:54 - 31:59)
column there's 50 of them don't care (31:57 - 32:01)
just make it all of them if you're going (31:59 - 32:04)
for a particular Shiny Pokemon if you (32:01 - 32:06)
really really want a particular Shiny (32:04 - 32:09)
Pokemon one uh strategy that you can use (32:06 - 32:12)
in this ridiculous game (32:09 - 32:12)
that Pokemon non-shine like if you see (32:13 - 32:18)
that Pokemon non-shiny earlier on you (32:16 - 32:21)
can feed it just enough so that you can (32:18 - 32:23)
for sure get it with a daily biscuit (32:21 - 32:27)
once you see the shiny one hacks (32:23 - 32:29)
already hacking the game I'm gonna put (32:27 - 32:31)
it's like putting my pedometer on the (32:29 - 32:33)
washing machine I got 17 (32:31 - 32:36)
000 steps (32:33 - 32:36)
um (32:37 - 32:41)
yeah I mean like I I guess for me (32:39 - 32:46)
because I have the currency I'm able to (32:41 - 32:49)
catch more Pokemon (32:46 - 32:51)
as soon as assuming they show up (32:49 - 32:53)
although I did like Greg get another (32:51 - 32:55)
Pikachu only because that Pikachu was (32:53 - 32:58)
super hungry so it was like very easy to (32:55 - 33:00)
catch it because he was the hungry one (32:58 - 33:02)
so I have three Pikachu in my Camp right (33:00 - 33:04)
now I have the one you start with the (33:02 - 33:05)
one that showed up and then the one (33:04 - 33:06)
wearing the Sleep hat because I (33:05 - 33:08)
connected it to the plus plus so I just (33:06 - 33:11)
got three Pikachus hanging out I'm (33:08 - 33:12)
thinking to myself I might as well keep (33:11 - 33:15)
catching all the Pikachu yeah I might as (33:12 - 33:17)
well just order the Pikachu Market (33:15 - 33:20)
pick a coin (33:17 - 33:23)
okay the store not to be confused with (33:20 - 33:24)
the premium pass (33:23 - 33:27)
but the the general store they have a uh (33:24 - 33:30)
as of a recording 26 days left there is (33:27 - 33:33)
a release celebration bundle small and a (33:30 - 33:36)
release celebration bundle medium the (33:33 - 33:40)
smallest 600 gems which is about ten (33:36 - 33:43)
dollars yeah which includes 15 Pokey (33:40 - 33:45)
biscuits and three incense friend (33:43 - 33:48)
incense and then the (33:45 - 33:53)
3 000 gems which is uh (33:48 - 33:57)
47.99 yep (33:53 - 33:57)
47.99 USD since uh that is 20 great (33:57 - 34:06)
biscuits seven friend incense and uh (34:02 - 34:07)
three helper whistles I don't know what (34:06 - 34:09)
the helper whistles do (34:07 - 34:13)
um and then there is the get three bonus (34:09 - 34:15)
dream clusters don't know what dream (34:13 - 34:17)
clusters do if you want to do these (34:15 - 34:18)
Bargains you can only get three of these (34:17 - 34:21)
Bargains uh they'll reset in eight days (34:18 - 34:24)
one is 600 gems which is eight Pokey (34:21 - 34:27)
biscuits which is better it's not as (34:24 - 34:29)
good as the celebration all right here's (34:27 - 34:31)
the here's the description of the helper (34:29 - 34:34)
whistle okay okay and especially (34:31 - 34:37)
energizing whistle one blow and your (34:34 - 34:39)
team of helpers will gather three hours (34:37 - 34:41)
worth of berries and ingredients for you (34:39 - 34:45)
this will not cause the main skills to (34:41 - 34:46)
trigger (34:45 - 34:48)
yeah that makes sense if you're trying (34:46 - 34:51)
to level up your week's Snorlax quicker (34:48 - 34:54)
so them getting berries (34:51 - 34:57)
is so you can cook Snorlax meals because (34:54 - 34:59)
one of the (34:57 - 35:00)
um (34:59 - 35:03)
no so berries are different from the (35:00 - 35:05)
ingredients you can put in the meals the (35:03 - 35:07)
berries go straight into snorlax's yeah (35:05 - 35:08)
it just eats them it just eats them (35:07 - 35:10)
berries but that's that's like the slow (35:08 - 35:13)
way to level them up you would do all of (35:10 - 35:16)
it you need to do all of it (35:13 - 35:18)
okay how how often are you checking this (35:16 - 35:20)
app are you checking it like twice a day (35:18 - 35:23)
I'm checking it now I do it for (35:20 - 35:25)
breakfast lunch and dinner and then at (35:23 - 35:28)
other points if I get bored so right now (35:25 - 35:30)
I have a level two great ball (35:28 - 35:32)
Snorlax almost level three great ball (35:30 - 35:34)
Snorlax and I have not done the premium (35:32 - 35:37)
at all okay I have a level two not (35:34 - 35:40)
almost level three (35:37 - 35:42)
Snorlax sounds like an open opening the (35:40 - 35:45)
app more than you I have a level one (35:42 - 35:49)
great ball Snorlax because I (35:45 - 35:52)
don't interact with this much although I (35:49 - 35:53)
will say that my Charmander loves (35:52 - 35:55)
finding sausages (35:53 - 35:58)
it's just a sausage Hound (35:55 - 36:01)
it's very Magikarp jump in like you can (35:58 - 36:03)
check it more often but there's not a (36:01 - 36:05)
lot to check because it's such a cute (36:03 - 36:07)
game (36:05 - 36:08)
um (36:07 - 36:11)
yeah the the store is very expensive (36:08 - 36:14)
although I can see that (36:11 - 36:17)
that doesn't matter because they just (36:14 - 36:20)
need people who don't (36:17 - 36:20)
people who are are (36:21 - 36:26)
luxurious enough to not consider fifty (36:23 - 36:28)
dollars a lot of money right like yeah (36:26 - 36:30)
they just need a handful of people that (36:28 - 36:32)
like fifty dollars is literally nothing (36:30 - 36:34)
you know these are probably people that (36:32 - 36:37)
fly first class and that is a norm for (36:34 - 36:39)
them right like (36:37 - 36:41)
this is the same reason why in Pokemon (36:39 - 36:43)
unite there are forty dollar skins (36:41 - 36:45)
because they know that like there's (36:43 - 36:47)
enough enough people out there that will (36:45 - 36:50)
pay the 40 skins that it will it will (36:47 - 36:52)
pay for itself I just I just got my (36:50 - 36:55)
Snorlax to Great level three and you're (36:52 - 36:57)
free what in my opinion what are you (36:55 - 36:59)
paying for (36:57 - 37:01)
I just have a hard time thinking that (36:59 - 37:03)
this is going to be somebody's (37:01 - 37:04)
it game (37:03 - 37:07)
like this is the game I'm sinking all my (37:04 - 37:10)
money in no it's a casual game it is (37:07 - 37:13)
this is it it has a lot of detail but (37:10 - 37:16)
you can only play so much (37:13 - 37:18)
I mean I feel like you could say the (37:16 - 37:20)
same thing about Pokemon go like there's (37:18 - 37:21)
so many people that I think there's more (37:20 - 37:23)
people that play Pokemon go that's like (37:21 - 37:25)
I've never given this game money and (37:23 - 37:28)
that's totally valid but like sometimes (37:25 - 37:32)
I look at even me who's level 48 in (37:28 - 37:34)
Pokemon go I've given it probably 200 a (37:32 - 37:36)
year every year since it's come out (37:34 - 37:39)
Richie Rich over here yeah yeah well I (37:36 - 37:41)
mean it's like what ten dollars ten to (37:39 - 37:43)
twenty dollars a month So eventually it (37:41 - 37:45)
hits like 200. (37:43 - 37:46)
um (37:45 - 37:49)
but even even me I'm like man people are (37:46 - 37:53)
spending like 15 a day on remote raids (37:49 - 37:56)
now they're not anymore not anymore or (37:53 - 37:58)
people or people will always be (37:56 - 38:00)
purchasing incubators and I'm just like (37:58 - 38:02)
what are you trying to hatch like I'm (38:00 - 38:05)
just so tired of hatching like dark at (38:02 - 38:07)
Larvesta I'm like there are still people (38:05 - 38:09)
trying to get that Larvesta yeah I mean (38:07 - 38:11)
I guess like I hatched like uh a (38:09 - 38:13)
Larvitar from like a 10K and I'm like (38:11 - 38:17)
what am I doing why why does this exist (38:13 - 38:19)
anymore so like I can totally like I get (38:17 - 38:21)
it like I when people look at stuff and (38:19 - 38:22)
they're like (38:21 - 38:25)
like who's giving Pokemon go money I (38:22 - 38:27)
totally get it but I I see the person (38:25 - 38:30)
giving sleep money like I do like the (38:27 - 38:34)
game enough where I'm like maybe I'll (38:30 - 38:36)
give it like the one time ten dollar (38:34 - 38:39)
thing for this limited edition bundle (38:36 - 38:40)
because that would be helpful but I (38:39 - 38:43)
can't stop thinking about (38:40 - 38:47)
how in three more days I'm not going to (38:43 - 38:48)
get 600 points and all of a sudden (38:47 - 38:52)
everything is going to be much harder (38:48 - 38:55)
from my use my like yeah I want to go at (38:52 - 38:57)
the same place right right which I'm (38:55 - 38:59)
literally your Snorlax isn't leveling up (38:57 - 39:00)
at the same pace so you're not even (38:59 - 39:02)
going now You Gotta Give me the sick (39:00 - 39:04)
tips Hannah I don't know you just have (39:02 - 39:05)
to eat breakfast lunch and dinner your (39:04 - 39:07)
Snorlax just has to eat breakfast lunch (39:05 - 39:09)
okay okay so I always skip breakfast (39:07 - 39:12)
that's probably why that might be it I (39:09 - 39:14)
always skip lunch because you don't need (39:12 - 39:17)
three meals a day you don't well that's (39:14 - 39:18)
probably that's also part of the problem (39:17 - 39:21)
even Mr Jose be tweeted it's really hard (39:18 - 39:23)
to give him all three meals (39:21 - 39:27)
because you're eventually going to (39:23 - 39:30)
run out of the ingredients (39:27 - 39:32)
I haven't hit that point yet because my (39:30 - 39:35)
Bulbasaur really likes finding honey (39:32 - 39:38)
I mean yeah honeymoon is a sausage hound (39:35 - 39:41)
and I already didn't have enough for 15. (39:38 - 39:44)
but you don't need 15. at a certain (39:41 - 39:46)
point like it so you don't need it was (39:44 - 39:48)
like oh hey we got three and then (39:46 - 39:51)
Charlotte's like yeah I guess fine (39:48 - 39:53)
you're cheap (39:51 - 39:55)
yeah I can totally see somebody giving (39:53 - 39:57)
this game money because they want to (39:55 - 40:00)
catch two Pokemon every session no (39:57 - 40:02)
matter what (40:00 - 40:05)
or they want to go to bed every night (40:02 - 40:07)
with an incense or they want the good (40:05 - 40:09)
tent I have a ticket for the free good (40:07 - 40:12)
tent I don't I haven't used it yet (40:09 - 40:15)
because I I'm gonna wait for the weekly (40:12 - 40:16)
reset or whatever which I think is on (40:15 - 40:19)
Sundays for everyone I think so yeah (40:16 - 40:21)
this Sunday Monday so I was like oh wow (40:19 - 40:22)
if I'm starting on a Wednesday why would (40:21 - 40:24)
I use the 10th they said the tent lasts (40:22 - 40:25)
a week (40:24 - 40:27)
I just don't get (40:25 - 40:30)
why anybody (40:27 - 40:32)
would accept for somebody running a web (40:30 - 40:34)
site like Serebii (40:32 - 40:35)
uh (40:34 - 40:38)
I don't know this is a fun cute one the (40:35 - 40:38)
big (40:38 - 40:42)
I get wanting a shiny immediately so I I (40:38 - 40:45)
get buying stuff when when a shiny pops (40:42 - 40:46)
up and you don't have the materials (40:45 - 40:48)
that's the one thing that really makes (40:46 - 40:50)
sense to me but I don't feel like I want (40:48 - 40:53)
to go faster on this game I said it last (40:50 - 40:55)
week I want to play this game for as (40:53 - 40:58)
long as I can it does seem like it's (40:55 - 41:00)
going to try and grow and keep being a (40:58 - 41:02)
thing though there's a tab for events (41:00 - 41:04)
this is trying to be a living game at (41:02 - 41:06)
least (41:04 - 41:06)
yeah (41:06 - 41:11)
um I mean Magikarp jump okay so two two (41:08 - 41:14)
things number one is like we brought up (41:11 - 41:15)
Pokemon go and how people pay a lot of (41:14 - 41:18)
money in Pokemon go Pokemon go out of (41:15 - 41:20)
every Pokemon game that probably exists (41:18 - 41:23)
is actually probably the most fair game (41:20 - 41:26)
for your dollar and I say that because I (41:23 - 41:29)
guarantee you 99 of people listening (41:26 - 41:31)
this podcast have never opened Cafe mix (41:29 - 41:34)
and looked at The Acorn prices in Cafe (41:31 - 41:36)
mix because holy cow that game is (41:34 - 41:39)
outrageous when it comes to pricing do (41:36 - 41:40)
you know and how hard it is to get (41:39 - 41:43)
acorns in this time of year next to (41:40 - 41:45)
Impossible they don't they aren't ready (41:43 - 41:47)
yet what you got to do is you gotta wait (41:45 - 41:49)
for the squirrels to start hiding them (41:47 - 41:51)
everywhere and then it's just you know (41:49 - 41:54)
locally Source them for free because I (41:51 - 41:56)
don't remember where they put things (41:54 - 41:58)
Pokemon unite for the most part wants (41:56 - 42:00)
ten dollars a month for their premium (41:58 - 42:03)
pass rate like whatever whatever it's (42:00 - 42:04)
called I can't remember what's called (42:03 - 42:06)
the the battle pass battle pass yeah (42:04 - 42:08)
they want they want ten dollars a month (42:06 - 42:09)
for their battle pass they forty dollar (42:08 - 42:11)
skins right there's there's a lot of (42:09 - 42:15)
things in Pokemon unite that cost money (42:11 - 42:17)
um and then what is the other Pokemon (42:15 - 42:20)
game that Master Masters we we've look (42:17 - 42:23)
Masters are they they fix a lot of (42:20 - 42:25)
things about Masters it's a very fun (42:23 - 42:27)
character collecting game the battling (42:25 - 42:28)
is still good if you like the battling (42:27 - 42:31)
very easy to ignore but let's start (42:28 - 42:34)
let's not kid ourselves when pulling 10 (42:31 - 42:37)
characters and Masters is is not cheap (42:34 - 42:40)
11. the least they made that so you're (42:37 - 42:41)
always if you're pulling a 10 it's 11 (42:40 - 42:44)
but yeah no it is not cheap (42:41 - 42:47)
I did actually give them money during (42:44 - 42:48)
the bead (42:47 - 42:50)
one and I still didn't get beat and I'm (42:48 - 42:51)
like well that's the one time you're (42:50 - 42:53)
ever getting cash out of me (42:51 - 42:56)
I will pay for again that I play a lot (42:53 - 42:58)
exactly once and if I don't get what I (42:56 - 43:01)
want never again (42:58 - 43:05)
I I don't think any of those games I (43:01 - 43:06)
just listed a bunch of Pokemon games (43:05 - 43:07)
because this is I don't know if you guys (43:06 - 43:09)
know this is a Pokemon podcast that's (43:07 - 43:11)
why I like to watch Pokemon games but (43:09 - 43:13)
there are a lot of mobile games (43:11 - 43:15)
thousands out there that are charging (43:13 - 43:17)
whatever they want for things because (43:15 - 43:19)
they know they just need a small amount (43:17 - 43:22)
of players to purchase (43:19 - 43:25)
the higher end stuff uh Pikmin Bloom (43:22 - 43:28)
this is my second point for a very long (43:25 - 43:30)
time didn't really have like a store you (43:28 - 43:33)
could buy like flowers even though they (43:30 - 43:35)
were pretty easy to get the fly I would (43:33 - 43:36)
say flowers in Pikmin Bloom were very (43:35 - 43:38)
similar to pokeballs like if you lived (43:36 - 43:40)
in a big city and you just played a lot (43:38 - 43:42)
it just you just the return just came (43:40 - 43:44)
back to you if you lived in the middle (43:42 - 43:46)
of nowhere (43:44 - 43:48)
obviously there was clothes you could (43:46 - 43:49)
buy (43:48 - 43:51)
um storage just like Pokemon go or (43:49 - 43:53)
Pokemon sleep you can increase your (43:51 - 43:54)
storage with real money that's at least (43:53 - 43:57)
permanent unlike flowers or nectar uh (43:54 - 43:58)
but (43:57 - 44:01)
weirdly enough overnight (43:58 - 44:03)
Pikmin Bloom decided to add (44:01 - 44:06)
so most games have like a 99 cents a (44:03 - 44:08)
five dollars a ten dollars twenty (44:06 - 44:11)
dollars a hundred dollars Pikmin Bloom (44:08 - 44:17)
has a 219 dollar option for 34 (44:11 - 44:19)
000 coins (44:17 - 44:23)
what why it's not 250 why it's not 200 (44:19 - 44:27)
it is 220 you get (44:23 - 44:32)
34 000 coins but you will get a bonus 11 (44:27 - 44:38)
779 free coins included at that price (44:32 - 44:38)
to do what for what what for why (44:41 - 44:49)
for what everything in Pikmin Bloom is (44:45 - 44:51)
just to accelerate accelerate the way (44:49 - 44:54)
you plant flowers it's get more nectar (44:51 - 44:56)
get more petals buy more incubators or (44:54 - 44:58)
Planters they're called in this game (44:56 - 45:01)
everything is just to accelerate (44:58 - 45:06)
um and the there that's like at least in (45:01 - 45:08)
Pokemon you could you could be like well (45:06 - 45:10)
I could see yourself paying money for a (45:08 - 45:11)
shiny (45:10 - 45:14)
that doesn't exist in Pikmin you're just (45:11 - 45:16)
like I'm you're just planting well there (45:14 - 45:17)
are technically more rare pigment but (45:16 - 45:20)
chef hat I want my chef hat I gotta (45:17 - 45:23)
hatch a chef hat it's just interesting (45:20 - 45:25)
that this is the like (45:23 - 45:28)
every game is free but if you would like (45:25 - 45:31)
to give us money and I have nothing I (45:28 - 45:32)
have I have nothing against giving a gay (45:31 - 45:34)
money if I'm having a good time mm-hmm (45:32 - 45:36)
like yeah (45:34 - 45:38)
I've given you night in the like what (45:36 - 45:41)
unites almost two years old I've given (45:38 - 45:44)
you night I think sixty dollars in two (45:41 - 45:47)
years and yep I I don't regret that like (45:44 - 45:50)
I've enjoyed my 300 some hours in (45:47 - 45:53)
Pokemon unite like (45:50 - 45:57)
I've given Pikmin bloom in two years (45:53 - 46:00)
25 I think (45:57 - 46:02)
which I've played Pikmin blue I think (46:00 - 46:05)
more than I played Diablo 4 and I've (46:02 - 46:07)
spent a hundred dollars on Diablo 4 (46:05 - 46:09)
because that was like the play it four (46:07 - 46:13)
days early special Mount battle pass (46:09 - 46:16)
like I played Pikmin blue more and I got (46:13 - 46:19)
more value (46:16 - 46:19)
like I kind of don't I'm having such a (46:21 - 46:25)
good time with sleep I kind of do want (46:24 - 46:27)
to throw it a couple extra dollars but (46:25 - 46:29)
also I I just don't know what the long (46:27 - 46:29)
term (46:29 - 46:31)
[Music] (46:29 - 46:33)
I like I don't I don't know what the (46:31 - 46:34)
long-term Outlook of sleep looks like at (46:33 - 46:36)
this point yeah what's your Roi on that (46:34 - 46:40)
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean like I said (46:36 - 46:43)
they have an events tab in there (46:40 - 46:45)
they have places where things to happen (46:43 - 46:48)
and I expect they may be able to make (46:45 - 46:50)
the Pokedex expand too because right now (46:48 - 46:52)
it seems like it only includes the first (46:50 - 46:54)
three generations but this this already (46:52 - 46:56)
feels like more was more than was in (46:54 - 46:59)
Magikarp jump because Magikarp yeah was (46:56 - 47:00)
great but it launched and it was there (46:59 - 47:02)
yeah it lost it was there look I'm (47:00 - 47:04)
excited for the next event where (47:02 - 47:06)
everybody has to sleep at the exact same (47:04 - 47:08)
time throughout the world so that they (47:06 - 47:10)
could actually finally take over the (47:08 - 47:12)
world without anybody being awake for it (47:10 - 47:14)
everybody we're calling it The Como week (47:12 - 47:17)
all of you just need to sleep for a week (47:14 - 47:19)
and you'll get a million coins do not (47:17 - 47:20)
care about what's happening in the world (47:19 - 47:22)
around you (47:20 - 47:27)
it'll be fine when you wake up (47:22 - 47:27)
uh I Magikarp jump isn't even updated to (47:27 - 47:35)
like the newer iPhone screens yeah yeah (47:30 - 47:35)
for the last time I opened that game was (47:37 - 47:40)
I wanted to look at the store but then I (47:39 - 47:42)
realized like I don't have my data (47:40 - 47:44)
anymore because it was like five phones (47:42 - 47:47)
ago I mean that is a flash the Pan game (47:44 - 47:49)
they should have a store and I remember (47:47 - 47:51)
the store in Magikarp jump kind of being (47:49 - 47:53)
ridiculous as well but they did have a (47:51 - 47:54)
store but they had an amount you could (47:53 - 47:57)
max out at a friend was pointing this (47:54 - 47:59)
out the other day that you could pay up (47:57 - 48:01)
to I think a hundred dollars in that (47:59 - 48:03)
store and that got you everything and (48:01 - 48:05)
you couldn't pay more after that there (48:03 - 48:07)
was actually a wall and in Pokemon sleep (48:05 - 48:10)
you can pay a hundred dollars a year for (48:07 - 48:12)
just the subscription and fifty dollars (48:10 - 48:14)
for the opening months (48:12 - 48:18)
you can still buy the other boxes (48:14 - 48:21)
and back in (48:18 - 48:21)
what am I where am I what am I looking (48:21 - 48:25)
for where's the where's the store (48:23 - 48:26)
oh I don't know where this is I don't (48:25 - 48:29)
remember movie shop (48:26 - 48:31)
okay yeah give us the prizes (48:29 - 48:35)
uh uh a spell tags 400 diamonds that how (48:31 - 48:37)
much are diamonds (48:35 - 48:39)
okay diamonds was the same same currency (48:37 - 48:40)
asleep (48:39 - 48:43)
oh wait here it is Diamond chop no where (48:40 - 48:45)
do I buy actually buy diamonds it's (48:43 - 48:46)
possible that the game is so old you (48:45 - 48:51)
can't give it money anymore very likely (48:46 - 48:53)
um (48:51 - 48:56)
oh here we go okay okay okay (48:53 - 48:59)
please don't walk me through uh 50 (48:56 - 49:02)
diamonds is 99 cents (48:59 - 49:08)
uh Pokemon sleep 60 is 1.19 okay uh 250 (49:02 - 49:11)
diamonds is 4.99 (49:08 - 49:14)
in Pokemon sleep 260 is 479 better deal (49:11 - 49:16)
better deal better deal better deal (49:14 - 49:20)
550 diamonds is 9.99 (49:16 - 49:21)
and these are all just slightly off in (49:20 - 49:26)
Pokemon sleep 620 is 10.99 (49:21 - 49:28)
on the plus side you can you if you want (49:26 - 49:30)
a positive thought here inflation hasn't (49:28 - 49:35)
hit the Pokemon Diamond industry uh 1 (49:30 - 49:39)
200 diamonds and manager jump is 19.99 (49:35 - 49:43)
that seems about on track with 1500 for (49:39 - 49:45)
23.99 (49:43 - 49:48)
and the last option is (49:45 - 49:51)
2150 diamonds (49:48 - 49:54)
for 34.99 yeah this is where Pokemon (49:51 - 49:57)
sleep just offers pack or bundles that (49:54 - 50:01)
are way more so 3 100 diamonds for 47.99 (49:57 - 50:04)
or 7 000 diamonds for almost a hundred (50:01 - 50:06)
dollars (50:04 - 50:06)
I don't want to pull the trigger (50:10 - 50:14)
don't I want to know what I'm getting (50:13 - 50:17)
nothing I mean I know what I'm getting (50:14 - 50:21)
nothing I'm getting I'm getting nothing (50:17 - 50:21)
I wonder how many people are going to (50:23 - 50:28)
this will be our my last thought before (50:25 - 50:29)
we go to break because we have to go to (50:28 - 50:32)
break I wonder how many people are I I (50:29 - 50:35)
almost think it's deceptive I almost (50:32 - 50:38)
think the like first (50:35 - 50:41)
week or two of this game are going to be (50:38 - 50:43)
overly generous so people lock into (50:41 - 50:46)
these six month trial of this game (50:43 - 50:48)
because they get their 14 days for free (50:46 - 50:50)
and then they stop playing after a month (50:48 - 50:51)
or so (50:50 - 50:53)
um (50:51 - 50:53)
that's how these work (50:53 - 50:58)
tried and true method that's why (50:55 - 51:00)
subscriptions exist (50:58 - 51:03)
because realistically I I'm not trying (51:00 - 51:05)
to shade or shame anyone for giving the (51:03 - 51:06)
game money if you're having a good time (51:05 - 51:08)
but like if you're gonna like you maybe (51:06 - 51:10)
you should give it just the one month (51:08 - 51:12)
trial and then if you if you're happy (51:10 - 51:14)
with your month and that's good and you (51:12 - 51:16)
got your enjoyment I mean what was that (51:14 - 51:19)
two two cups of coffee at Starbucks and (51:16 - 51:21)
then you don't have to feel bad that (51:19 - 51:23)
you're not playing the game for five (51:21 - 51:25)
more months and (51:23 - 51:28)
how how did our standard of how much (51:25 - 51:31)
things cost become cups of coffee at (51:28 - 51:33)
Starbucks I don't know why is it not a (51:31 - 51:36)
good analogy why I mean (51:33 - 51:37)
it's an okay analogy (51:36 - 51:40)
it is basically saying like here's this (51:37 - 51:43)
other frivolous thing coffee that you're (51:40 - 51:45)
wasting money on like I don't think I (51:43 - 51:48)
mean our culture as someone who doesn't (51:45 - 51:52)
drink coffee our culture puts a lot into (51:48 - 51:54)
coffee I mean like let's compare it to (51:52 - 51:57)
gallons of milk this is how many gallons (51:54 - 51:59)
some people don't like milk oh here's (51:57 - 52:01)
how many gallons of gas that you have (51:59 - 52:03)
look I don't like coffee people don't go (52:01 - 52:04)
to Starbucks I don't like Starbucks (52:03 - 52:06)
either here's how many loaves you know (52:04 - 52:08)
it used to be loaves of bread that we (52:06 - 52:11)
used to compare but Starbucks is way (52:08 - 52:14)
cheaper than your Ma and Pa coffee shop (52:11 - 52:16)
with like so you either go to Starbucks (52:14 - 52:18)
and you get like mediocre coffee at like (52:16 - 52:20)
a price with like somebody very (52:18 - 52:22)
depressed with life working behind the (52:20 - 52:24)
counter which is like fine or you can go (52:22 - 52:26)
to like some like (52:24 - 52:28)
Standalone coffee shop where they're (52:26 - 52:29)
going to charge you like two dollars (52:28 - 52:30)
more coffee and then you're gonna have (52:29 - 52:32)
some hipster Edge Lord behind the (52:30 - 52:33)
counter that wants to have a whole (52:32 - 52:34)
conversation with you which I don't want (52:33 - 52:38)
I do all jobs they're all jobs where (52:34 - 52:39)
they're all getting yelled at for doing (52:38 - 52:41)
their job look and I don't think that (52:39 - 52:43)
the other cups of coffee cost that much (52:41 - 52:46)
I would rather go to my local support by (52:43 - 52:49)
local business than union busting (52:46 - 52:53)
Starbucks so let's let's get let's go (52:49 - 52:55)
okay this is it for YouTube come up with (52:53 - 52:57)
the new thing we're measuring money (52:55 - 53:00)
against because Starbucks is off (52:57 - 53:02)
it should be diamonds because diamonds (53:00 - 53:05)
hasn't had any inflation it will that's (53:02 - 53:08)
true maybe maybe Greg I haven't found uh (53:05 - 53:10)
an independent coffee shop in (53:08 - 53:13)
Minneapolis you don't like people (53:10 - 53:13)
you like don't want to talk to your (53:15 - 53:18)
hairdresser you don't want to talk to (53:17 - 53:20)
your Barista you don't want to talk to (53:18 - 53:21)
your oil people you don't want to talk (53:20 - 53:23)
to your people who are helping you at (53:21 - 53:26)
the grocery store (53:23 - 53:26)
you don't want to talk to anybody and (53:26 - 53:31)
you're like who is great here I'm like (53:29 - 53:33)
why does it matter you don't want to (53:31 - 53:35)
interact with them for the record I (53:33 - 53:37)
don't go to Starbucks I go to Caribou (53:35 - 53:39)
and I've always had good interactions at (53:37 - 53:41)
Caribou but I can't use Caribou as an (53:39 - 53:43)
analogy because they closed down 90 of (53:41 - 53:45)
them that weren't in Minnesota yeah you (53:43 - 53:47)
can also want to support better (53:45 - 53:49)
companies even if you aren't in the mood (53:47 - 53:52)
to talk to people that day I say as an (53:49 - 53:54)
interview I'm looking for something that (53:52 - 53:56)
isn't Starbucks but also not charging me (53:54 - 53:59)
three extra dollars for a drink that's (53:56 - 54:01)
not that great I could list a ton in (53:59 - 54:02)
your area (54:01 - 54:05)
not the care the caribous I go to are (54:02 - 54:07)
are the cameras are good look you are (54:05 - 54:09)
supporting a tech just like when I shop (54:07 - 54:11)
at Target I'm supporting a local (54:09 - 54:12)
business (54:11 - 54:14)
yeah (54:12 - 54:16)
you could take care of them and support (54:14 - 54:19)
your local businesses no I I'm just not (54:16 - 54:22)
a person that like shames somebody into (54:19 - 54:23)
getting a cup of coffee because like (54:22 - 54:25)
that that is like that is (54:23 - 54:28)
my parents would be like the reason you (54:25 - 54:30)
can't do this is because you're getting (54:28 - 54:32)
one one five dollar Starbucks drink a (54:30 - 54:33)
week and this is why you don't have (54:32 - 54:36)
money look if that if your five dollar (54:33 - 54:38)
Starbucks drink a week genuinely that (54:36 - 54:39)
makes you happy and that's something you (54:38 - 54:41)
look forward to then it's worth the five (54:39 - 54:44)
bucks just like if the 40 (54:41 - 54:46)
cramerant skin in Pokemon unite (54:44 - 54:48)
genuinely makes you happy then get the (54:46 - 54:50)
cramerans get it like catch the skin (54:48 - 54:53)
just get it let's do it just do it just (54:50 - 54:55)
give 27 in Pokemon sleep you're gonna (54:53 - 54:58)
love it just I I can't just see it just (54:55 - 55:00)
spend your money just give me your money (54:58 - 55:02)
give me I need money give your money to (55:00 - 55:04)
me I will bet I'll I'll make you a cup (55:02 - 55:07)
of coffee for fifteen dollars we're all (55:04 - 55:09)
getting avocado toast after this all (55:07 - 55:12)
right yeah well we can take a break when (55:09 - 55:15)
we come back we're gonna talk about (55:12 - 55:16)
stuff getting canceled (55:15 - 55:19)
pretty much like you (55:16 - 55:22)
we'll be right right back (55:19 - 55:26)
and we are back from our break (55:22 - 55:28)
there's this little thing called Pokemon (55:26 - 55:31)
worlds that is happening in (55:28 - 55:34)
like two and a half I don't know three (55:31 - 55:37)
weeks I don't know it's soon sooner than (55:34 - 55:40)
it feels like it's very soon uh (55:37 - 55:44)
yeah it's it's I think it takes place on (55:40 - 55:48)
the 11th it does so yeah about three (55:44 - 55:50)
weeks away uh and the Pokemon company (55:48 - 55:53)
decided to announce (55:50 - 55:55)
that there are canceling (55:53 - 55:58)
the Yokohama open (55:55 - 56:00)
um (55:58 - 56:03)
on their uh worlds.pokemon.com it just (56:00 - 56:05)
says regretfully the decision has been (56:03 - 56:07)
made to cancel the Yokohama open please (56:05 - 56:09)
look forward to participating in its fun (56:07 - 56:10)
side events and activities throughout (56:09 - 56:13)
the weekend (56:10 - 56:13)
you (56:15 - 56:18)
yeah good good luck getting into any (56:16 - 56:21)
event good luck (56:18 - 56:21)
um if you if you don't know what the (56:23 - 56:30)
open is I can explain (56:25 - 56:30)
um (56:30 - 56:32)
hold on I had I had the (56:35 - 56:39)
well we I guess we can just go through (56:41 - 56:45)
why people are upset this is off Esports (56:43 - 56:47)
Illustrated not to be confused with (56:45 - 56:51)
Sports Illustrated (56:47 - 56:51)
I think may may still be uh and they're (56:51 - 56:57)
probably separate yeah they're probably (56:55 - 56:58)
separate yes but I think Sports (56:57 - 57:00)
Illustrated is probably still going on (56:58 - 57:02)
they're probably still doing their (57:00 - 57:03)
things (57:02 - 57:05)
uh (57:03 - 57:05)
so the Pokemon company announced that (57:06 - 57:09)
all various activities at Worlds would (57:08 - 57:12)
be available to spectators not competing (57:09 - 57:15)
in the main competition would be raffled (57:12 - 57:18)
away uh similar to the badges trainers (57:15 - 57:21)
had to uh hope for enough luck to be (57:18 - 57:24)
able to even watch the live show or go (57:21 - 57:27)
to the exclusive store many who were (57:24 - 57:28)
lucky enough to get a spectator badge in (57:27 - 57:31)
the uh Lottery were ultimately unable to (57:28 - 57:34)
do anything with their badges correct so (57:31 - 57:35)
I (57:34 - 57:38)
so you you could win the badge for the (57:35 - 57:40)
lottery to get into the show floor and (57:38 - 57:42)
then realize (57:40 - 57:46)
that other things needed tickets that (57:42 - 57:49)
you had to then sign up for lotteries (57:46 - 57:52)
then this is why people are mad on July (57:49 - 57:54)
20th the Pokemon Twitter account stated (57:52 - 57:56)
the Yokohama open which was a (57:54 - 57:59)
competitive which had a competitive TCG (57:56 - 58:00)
players around the world hyped to start (57:59 - 58:03)
off the 2024 season strong (58:00 - 58:04)
um (58:03 - 58:06)
has been canceled (58:04 - 58:09)
uh and the open was for people who (58:06 - 58:13)
didn't qualify for the main worlds they (58:09 - 58:15)
could participate to then get points (58:13 - 58:19)
going into the next season so this was (58:15 - 58:21)
something (58:19 - 58:23)
that people traveled would pay money to (58:21 - 58:26)
to travel to because one they want to (58:23 - 58:27)
get a head start on their competitive (58:26 - 58:29)
season I don't know if you guys haven't (58:27 - 58:31)
been listening to this podcast for the (58:29 - 58:32)
last year but if you're trying to (58:31 - 58:34)
qualify for worlds it is pretty much a (58:32 - 58:37)
full-time job and you need like a (58:34 - 58:39)
full-time job income to pay for the (58:37 - 58:43)
amount of hotels and flights and (58:39 - 58:45)
everything else that involves going to (58:43 - 58:49)
California Florida Texas yeah New Jersey (58:45 - 58:51)
to get enough points to then qualify for (58:49 - 58:53)
worlds so (58:51 - 58:56)
the the open has been something they've (58:53 - 58:59)
been doing for a long time this is not (58:56 - 59:02)
like new it is new that they canceled it (58:59 - 59:04)
um there's a whole separate conversation (59:02 - 59:06)
of whether they should even have the (59:04 - 59:09)
open uh which I I don't think it's (59:06 - 59:11)
particularly good but that doesn't that (59:09 - 59:13)
shouldn't invalidate the people who have (59:11 - 59:15)
been planning this trip for months (59:13 - 59:18)
to not only see Japan which the argument (59:15 - 59:20)
is like (59:18 - 59:22)
uh well they shouldn't be upset because (59:20 - 59:24)
they're still fortunate enough to be in (59:22 - 59:26)
Japan for a week and they can tour and (59:24 - 59:28)
it's like that's (59:26 - 59:31)
that changes your entire plans like if I (59:28 - 59:33)
if I'm if I'm paying all this money to (59:31 - 59:38)
compete to set up for my 2024 season (59:33 - 59:40)
like I could then use that money to (59:38 - 59:44)
travel to other 2024 events (59:40 - 59:46)
like it's it's just a it's just a bad (59:44 - 59:47)
argument it but (59:46 - 59:49)
the amount of (59:47 - 59:53)
the amount of money you already spent to (59:49 - 59:55)
just get to Japan (59:53 - 59:58)
to find out (59:55 - 60:01)
barely a month before the thing that you (59:58 - 60:02)
are spending (60:01 - 60:05)
no small amount of money on isn't (60:02 - 60:08)
happening and there's not a good way to (60:05 - 60:12)
get that money back because they're like (60:08 - 60:14)
and this isn't the (60:12 - 60:15)
isn't nothing this worth either they (60:14 - 60:17)
announced the location for worlds they (60:15 - 60:19)
announced the dates for worlds and then (60:17 - 60:21)
like a month later they said oh hey it's (60:19 - 60:23)
a raffle yeah and you might not be able (60:21 - 60:27)
to go I don't even be able to go I don't (60:23 - 60:27)
anybody from the outside looking in (60:28 - 60:35)
would be like what is this clown show (60:31 - 60:40)
how is this National worldwide most (60:35 - 60:45)
popular brand this bad at doing things (60:40 - 60:49)
like it is such (60:45 - 60:49)
it is such a bad look and it's even (60:50 - 60:54)
worse for people inside they're like (60:53 - 60:57)
yeah I have no way to explain this (60:54 - 61:01)
either it is just bad decisions all (60:57 - 61:03)
around (61:01 - 61:04)
they're still hyping it up and for (61:03 - 61:07)
people who got the tickets and who are (61:04 - 61:09)
going to be able to go to these things (61:07 - 61:11)
it looks like it'll be really really (61:09 - 61:12)
cool it looks like it could be an (61:11 - 61:15)
amazing event if you can go but from the (61:12 - 61:18)
outside if you're not able to go for one (61:15 - 61:20)
reason or another it's kind of a mess (61:18 - 61:23)
yeah and like they had a whole they had (61:20 - 61:25)
a whole tournament info on this too it (61:23 - 61:28)
was like kick off your 2024 season (61:25 - 61:31)
um at Yokohama worlds both for the TCG (61:28 - 61:33)
and video game competitions will take (61:31 - 61:35)
place at the convention center from the (61:33 - 61:38)
12th to the 13th Championship points (61:35 - 61:39)
will be the same as a regional (61:38 - 61:41)
championship event meaning that players (61:39 - 61:43)
will be able to earn points towards (61:41 - 61:45)
their next worlds (61:43 - 61:46)
world's competitors who have been (61:45 - 61:50)
eliminated are welcome to participate by (61:46 - 61:53)
registering ahead of time (61:50 - 61:54)
um (61:53 - 61:56)
uh it was structured a little bit (61:54 - 61:58)
differently this year that made that (61:56 - 62:00)
part a little bit harder I think but it (61:58 - 62:02)
was still gonna happen yeah it even said (62:00 - 62:05)
if more than 800 players compete the (62:02 - 62:06)
master division will be split into two (62:05 - 62:09)
like they had this whole tournament laid (62:06 - 62:12)
out on their website this this was not (62:09 - 62:14)
about it was on worlds.pokemon.com they (62:12 - 62:16)
had this whole how the open was supposed (62:14 - 62:19)
to work now a side note I don't think (62:16 - 62:22)
it'd be open is particularly great (62:19 - 62:25)
because it does (62:22 - 62:29)
it is it you could say that it's like (62:25 - 62:32)
silly to travel to an event to then (62:29 - 62:35)
participate in that event for the next (62:32 - 62:38)
year when that current year's finals are (62:35 - 62:41)
happening like as a as a competitor it (62:38 - 62:42)
kind of sucks because you can't watch (62:41 - 62:44)
those finals because you're competing (62:42 - 62:46)
and as a viewer (62:44 - 62:48)
it kind of sucks because now you're (62:46 - 62:50)
split between watching two things you're (62:48 - 62:52)
watching like the start of a season but (62:50 - 62:54)
then you're watching the end of a season (62:52 - 62:57)
two realistically I think the open (62:54 - 63:00)
should go away (62:57 - 63:01)
and I think they should just do a last (63:00 - 63:03)
chance qualifier (63:01 - 63:04)
like (63:03 - 63:06)
they should just have it where they have (63:04 - 63:09)
a tournament and whoever wins that (63:06 - 63:12)
tournament moves on into (63:09 - 63:14)
the World tournament that is happening (63:12 - 63:16)
the next day I think that is more (63:14 - 63:19)
realistic and more fun and (63:16 - 63:21)
because you you could you could win the (63:19 - 63:23)
open and then (63:21 - 63:25)
I don't know your life changes and all (63:23 - 63:27)
of a sudden you can't play Pokemon and (63:25 - 63:29)
like a year later like that didn't (63:27 - 63:32)
matter yeah whereas like if you go to (63:29 - 63:36)
Japan you you're confident maybe there's (63:32 - 63:37)
a little bit of luck you win the last (63:36 - 63:39)
chance qualifier all of a sudden now (63:37 - 63:41)
you're in the world championship on that (63:39 - 63:43)
big stage and that (63:41 - 63:45)
I feel like there's more value there of (63:43 - 63:46)
whether (63:45 - 63:48)
they should do an open for next year (63:46 - 63:49)
they should do a last trans qualifier (63:48 - 63:51)
they used to do last chance qualifiers a (63:49 - 63:54)
lot more and it feels like they moving (63:51 - 63:58)
away from that as well too but (63:54 - 63:58)
this is a bad look (63:58 - 64:05)
all together yep is it as bad as uh just (64:01 - 64:07)
telling people who are protesting that (64:05 - 64:09)
they were no longer qualified because (64:07 - 64:12)
that happened in this whole mess too (64:09 - 64:15)
everything players yeah now they're (64:12 - 64:16)
still banned for life by the way if if (64:15 - 64:18)
you guys wanted an update on the like (64:16 - 64:21)
four Korean players that used metronome (64:18 - 64:23)
they they are still permanently banned (64:21 - 64:25)
for life these were some of the best (64:23 - 64:29)
players in the world by the way (64:25 - 64:29)
um (64:32 - 64:36)
so yeah I I I'm looking at this from (64:33 - 64:39)
from an outside before we get too deep I (64:36 - 64:41)
I just disclosure the Pokemon company (64:39 - 64:45)
has paid for my hotel at Worlds I I did (64:41 - 64:48)
pay for my flight out of pocket and I (64:45 - 64:49)
have no clue (64:48 - 64:53)
what things I I don't I literally as (64:49 - 64:54)
we're three weeks away I have no clue (64:53 - 64:56)
what I'm invited to I don't know if I'm (64:54 - 64:58)
going to the light show I don't know if (64:56 - 65:00)
I'm going to the parade I don't know if (64:58 - 65:03)
I can go on to VSS and TCG trading thing (65:00 - 65:05)
I have no clue what I'm invited to they (65:03 - 65:08)
just said which we're inviting you out (65:05 - 65:09)
would you like a hotel room and a (65:08 - 65:12)
partner press pass and I was like thank (65:09 - 65:14)
you that's very nice of you now that (65:12 - 65:17)
being said looking from The Outsider in (65:14 - 65:19)
I still can't get over the fact that (65:17 - 65:22)
people bought tickets to Yokohama they (65:19 - 65:24)
bought flights they bought (65:22 - 65:27)
the hotels and then (65:24 - 65:30)
not even two months before this whole (65:27 - 65:32)
thing happened they were like it's a (65:30 - 65:37)
raffle yeah for badges it's not so (65:32 - 65:41)
it's so baffling to me and even if you (65:37 - 65:44)
win The Spectator badge there's a raffle (65:41 - 65:46)
for eight other things that you could (65:44 - 65:49)
possibly do there's pretty much no (65:46 - 65:50)
chance you're gonna be able to go to a (65:49 - 65:53)
thing with a friend nope yeah like so so (65:50 - 65:55)
good luck like I I filled out this ship (65:53 - 65:58)
thing the other day and I couldn't add a (65:55 - 66:01)
guest that was not an option you I I (65:58 - 66:03)
filled out the and then I I sent it to (66:01 - 66:05)
the other people I'm traveling with and (66:03 - 66:06)
I'm like (66:05 - 66:10)
uh good luck if you can get on the ship (66:06 - 66:13)
maybe my press badge gets me onto the (66:10 - 66:15)
ship that's cool but you don't have one (66:13 - 66:18)
so that's like a weird thing about (66:15 - 66:20)
travel like I don't know if you're (66:18 - 66:21)
traveling with like three other people (66:20 - 66:24)
you kind of want to do stuff with them (66:21 - 66:25)
you don't want to do everything with (66:24 - 66:27)
them but also I don't want to go on a (66:25 - 66:29)
ship by myself and be like (66:27 - 66:31)
cool like come back off like man you (66:29 - 66:33)
really should have been on that ship it (66:31 - 66:35)
was cool (66:33 - 66:35)
the fact that like (66:36 - 66:44)
everything is a raffle like I (66:39 - 66:44)
how did they not like at what point did (66:44 - 66:49)
they be like oh man (66:47 - 66:52)
we have too many people coming we have (66:49 - 66:55)
to really raffle all this stuff off like (66:52 - 66:57)
at what point did you did they suddenly (66:55 - 67:00)
do the math because you have been (66:57 - 67:04)
planning this for an incredibly long (67:00 - 67:07)
time you've also been doing worlds for (67:04 - 67:09)
an incredibly long time you know how (67:07 - 67:12)
many people show up on average you know (67:09 - 67:14)
how busy things are you know what sells (67:12 - 67:18)
you have this data like it this isn't (67:14 - 67:20)
your first one (67:18 - 67:24)
it is their first one in Japan though (67:20 - 67:27)
so this changes it changes some things (67:24 - 67:29)
yeah maybe here's the thing it's like (67:27 - 67:31)
saying this is the first one we've done (67:29 - 67:33)
in Disney World (67:31 - 67:37)
cool you still have a ton of history and (67:33 - 67:41)
interest that you can forecast out and (67:37 - 67:43)
make decisions there is no way they got (67:41 - 67:48)
to a month before and said oh man we (67:43 - 67:50)
never even thought of this like you have (67:48 - 67:53)
been doing this for years this has been (67:50 - 67:57)
like Gen Con saying oh man (67:53 - 68:00)
we have to have vendors (67:57 - 68:03)
like you've been doing it for 20 years (68:00 - 68:06)
of course you do (68:03 - 68:08)
I it's (68:06 - 68:10)
it's it's tough in in one instance (68:08 - 68:12)
because (68:10 - 68:15)
almost everything in Japan (68:12 - 68:18)
has a raffle system of some sort like (68:15 - 68:19)
I've talked about this before I went to (68:18 - 68:22)
like a BTS Cafe in Japan it was bad it (68:19 - 68:23)
was the worst Cafe ever been to that (68:22 - 68:26)
being said you had to sign up for a (68:23 - 68:27)
raffle be just because there were so (68:26 - 68:29)
many people that wanted to go to the BTS (68:27 - 68:31)
Cafe we signed up for the raffle we (68:29 - 68:34)
didn't get in all of a sudden four (68:31 - 68:35)
people (68:34 - 68:37)
decline that they could make it and then (68:35 - 68:39)
they re-raffled again and then we were (68:37 - 68:41)
picked and we were picked literally like (68:39 - 68:44)
48 hours before our thing we said we (68:41 - 68:46)
were coming and then we showed up and it (68:44 - 68:47)
was bad (68:46 - 68:50)
um for a hot tip if you're going to (68:47 - 68:51)
Japan and you have nothing to do because (68:50 - 68:52)
you couldn't get into the World (68:51 - 68:56)
Tournament don't go to pop-up shop cafes (68:52 - 68:59)
no they're bad go to the cafes that have (68:56 - 69:01)
like actually have buildings they're (68:59 - 69:02)
much better (69:01 - 69:05)
you also need to make a reservation for (69:02 - 69:06)
most of those (69:05 - 69:08)
and I don't think the raffle is (69:06 - 69:11)
inherently the worst part of it I think (69:08 - 69:13)
that the timing and the not being able (69:11 - 69:15)
to include a guest that if those two (69:13 - 69:17)
things were fixed the raffle would be (69:15 - 69:19)
much less of a problem the timing the (69:17 - 69:22)
raffle was six months before this would (69:19 - 69:24)
have been a much better situation (69:22 - 69:27)
because who is booking a flight and (69:24 - 69:30)
hotel two months before going to Japan (69:27 - 69:32)
like yeah I know some people are yeah (69:30 - 69:35)
but like realistically like you need to (69:32 - 69:37)
take off work yeah prices go up when you (69:35 - 69:40)
get closer like I would imagine that (69:37 - 69:41)
most people who booked their stuff for (69:40 - 69:45)
Yokohama probably did it five to six (69:41 - 69:47)
months beforehand yeah so if we would (69:45 - 69:50)
have known yeah that there was a raffle (69:47 - 69:52)
people maybe would have waited to see if (69:50 - 69:54)
they got into the raffle before booking (69:52 - 69:57)
correct like it should have happened (69:54 - 69:59)
it's the timing right like we when I (69:57 - 70:01)
went to Disney World earlier this year (69:59 - 70:04)
you had to get up a specific time to try (70:01 - 70:07)
to get into a raffle to get onto the (70:04 - 70:10)
biggest rides right like but I knew that (70:07 - 70:14)
going in right like they had told me (70:10 - 70:18)
well before me even showing up that like (70:14 - 70:22)
hey these rides are on this system and (70:18 - 70:23)
this is what you need to do if you want (70:22 - 70:26)
to try to get into them on that day and (70:23 - 70:29)
they only they open up at 7 00 a.m you (70:26 - 70:31)
have to log in put your name in and (70:29 - 70:33)
we'll let you know and just like all (70:31 - 70:35)
other Raffles your time of Entry can (70:33 - 70:37)
change they will send you a photo saying (70:35 - 70:39)
hey guess what you got moved up (70:37 - 70:43)
get over there for it but we knew that (70:39 - 70:48)
going in this is this this is so (70:43 - 70:52)
if amateurish like what are you doing (70:48 - 70:55)
like you you you didn't even think about (70:52 - 70:58)
the people that have to deal with this (70:55 - 71:01)
or the timing this was not an expected (70:58 - 71:04)
part of this whole process it was just (71:01 - 71:06)
like surprise and then surprise this (71:04 - 71:07)
thing also (71:06 - 71:09)
that we've been doing for a long time is (71:07 - 71:13)
also canceled why shut up (71:09 - 71:13)
it's it's they they created this problem (71:14 - 71:18)
as well (71:16 - 71:21)
they they did such a good job (71:18 - 71:22)
here let me praise the Pokemon company (71:21 - 71:25)
for a second they did such a good job at (71:22 - 71:27)
making worlds an event you want to (71:25 - 71:30)
travel to even if you did not compete (71:27 - 71:32)
and this is something I've been saying (71:30 - 71:35)
on the show for (71:32 - 71:38)
eight years now of like people will come (71:35 - 71:39)
in and they'll be like should I should I (71:38 - 71:41)
go to world should I go to Regional (71:39 - 71:43)
should I go to a Nationals (71:41 - 71:45)
and I always have like these like you (71:43 - 71:47)
know I wouldn't fly to this event but I (71:45 - 71:49)
would fly here I wouldn't like if you (71:47 - 71:51)
lived within two hours it's worth going (71:49 - 71:53)
if not probably not worth getting a (71:51 - 71:55)
hotel and (71:53 - 71:58)
after a while worlds was a thing where (71:55 - 72:00)
you could be like it is worth flying to (71:58 - 72:03)
it is it is worth spending three days (72:00 - 72:05)
taking time off work bringing your kids (72:03 - 72:07)
bringing your significant other bringing (72:05 - 72:09)
Grandma like these these events are now (72:07 - 72:12)
to the point where it's worth going to (72:09 - 72:15)
and I think a lot of people were really (72:12 - 72:19)
bummed that they could not go to London (72:15 - 72:21)
because the last couple in the United (72:19 - 72:24)
States were really good like the the DC (72:21 - 72:27)
one before covet was great and a lot of (72:24 - 72:29)
people regretted not going to that (72:27 - 72:30)
mostly because like covet came out of (72:29 - 72:32)
nowhere and then it was like oh I should (72:30 - 72:33)
have should have went to the Pokemon (72:32 - 72:35)
thing before I needed three years of not (72:33 - 72:37)
being able to (72:35 - 72:38)
and then you know (72:37 - 72:41)
you know covet is (72:38 - 72:43)
quote unquote over to the point where (72:41 - 72:45)
you could fly somewhere right like you (72:43 - 72:48)
could go to London but people couldn't (72:45 - 72:50)
afford that so it was like okay well (72:48 - 72:52)
that man world is back this one looked (72:50 - 72:53)
really cool there were so many things (72:52 - 72:57)
happening in London uh and that's okay (72:53 - 72:59)
I'll go next year (72:57 - 73:01)
and so people saved they saved to go to (72:59 - 73:03)
Japan they wanted to go to Japan they (73:01 - 73:04)
wanted to go to Worlds they wanted it (73:03 - 73:07)
all to be lined up and then again (73:04 - 73:09)
if they would have announced the raffle (73:07 - 73:11)
stuff early if they would have announced (73:09 - 73:13)
stuff earlier if they announced the (73:11 - 73:14)
raffle on the same day they announced (73:13 - 73:17)
the dates (73:14 - 73:17)
oh it just set expectations oh yeah the (73:19 - 73:23)
dates of got it got out they announced (73:21 - 73:27)
Yokohama like yeah the place yeah yeah (73:23 - 73:28)
months and months before they announced (73:27 - 73:29)
when it was going to be if they (73:28 - 73:32)
announced the raffle system on the day (73:29 - 73:35)
they said this is when the event is (73:32 - 73:37)
that would have been just fine that is (73:35 - 73:40)
when they should have announced it or or (73:37 - 73:43)
I also hate to say this too you know at (73:40 - 73:45)
least eight to six months ahead of time (73:43 - 73:48)
when most people would start really (73:45 - 73:50)
planning and trying to get this time off (73:48 - 73:53)
like you can hold off on getting (73:50 - 73:55)
Airlines till about three months before (73:53 - 73:57)
because prices do drop when they finally (73:55 - 73:59)
like solid because Airlines cannot (73:57 - 74:01)
solidify their plans six months in (73:59 - 74:03)
advance they're taking their best guess (74:01 - 74:04)
that they're going to have planes and (74:03 - 74:08)
Pilots like again when you book wayfar (74:04 - 74:11)
out you can get hurt quite a lot by the (74:08 - 74:13)
airline industry especially now (74:11 - 74:16)
but usually people start planning trips (74:13 - 74:18)
about six months out because you've got (74:16 - 74:21)
a lot to get into your system you got (74:18 - 74:23)
time off from work you start looking at (74:21 - 74:26)
prices figuring it out (74:23 - 74:28)
it should have been before that six (74:26 - 74:31)
months Mark not oh it's around the (74:28 - 74:33)
corner FYI you'll get here and have (74:31 - 74:35)
nothing to do (74:33 - 74:38)
it's almost like the the the (74:35 - 74:40)
free entry it's not really free entry if (74:38 - 74:42)
you've never been to a world it's like (74:40 - 74:45)
eleven dollars to like go and then they (74:42 - 74:47)
give you like three booster packs which (74:45 - 74:48)
is you're pretty much paying for three (74:47 - 74:50)
booster packs but now we're getting to a (74:48 - 74:52)
point where like maybe they have to (74:50 - 74:54)
start charging or maybe there should be (74:52 - 74:56)
like a (74:54 - 75:00)
premium tier where you can get into (74:56 - 75:03)
Worlds but you can also be able to do (75:00 - 75:05)
like three of these events like we we (75:03 - 75:07)
saw it with Nationals where people (75:05 - 75:09)
bought a spectator pass but it didn't (75:07 - 75:12)
matter because non-spectator scalpers (75:09 - 75:15)
just waited in line at Pokemon Center (75:12 - 75:17)
and then they got in and they bought (75:15 - 75:18)
anything and it was like (75:17 - 75:20)
what was the point of getting a (75:18 - 75:23)
spectator pass and picking a Time on the (75:20 - 75:25)
website and then waiting in line and (75:23 - 75:26)
then getting in and being like (75:25 - 75:29)
everything is gone (75:26 - 75:32)
like who at this company (75:29 - 75:35)
are planning these events like (75:32 - 75:36)
each (75:35 - 75:38)
it's (75:36 - 75:41)
and it puts such a sour taste in (75:38 - 75:44)
people's mouths of (75:41 - 75:47)
like their experience of Pokemon for (75:44 - 75:50)
whatever you want to say about Niantic (75:47 - 75:53)
they at least give you a rough outline (75:50 - 75:54)
of what's going to happen at a go Fest (75:53 - 75:57)
early like they didn't you know we (75:54 - 75:58)
didn't know it was what we knew it was (75:57 - 76:00)
Diane said when they announced it but (75:58 - 76:03)
they didn't say right (76:00 - 76:05)
um but they were like (76:03 - 76:07)
here's here's the dates for go Fest (76:05 - 76:10)
here's the cost of a ticket here's (76:07 - 76:12)
roughly what you will get all right (76:10 - 76:15)
we'll see you in four months or however (76:12 - 76:17)
it was three or three or four months and (76:15 - 76:19)
then of course like what like two weeks (76:17 - 76:22)
ago we got like all the details of it (76:19 - 76:25)
but when Worlds was like okay world is (76:22 - 76:27)
going to be in Yokohama August 11th (76:25 - 76:30)
through 14th tickets eventually things (76:27 - 76:33)
eventually like we didn't learn that (76:30 - 76:35)
there was a light show or a parade or a (76:33 - 76:38)
ship or all this stuff until like a (76:35 - 76:40)
month until after it was already a (76:38 - 76:43)
lottery system yeah and then like oh you (76:40 - 76:45)
missed the day of the lottery well too (76:43 - 76:47)
bad not even if you entered the lottery (76:45 - 76:49)
you would have gone in but like it's (76:47 - 76:51)
it's (76:49 - 76:55)
I I'm saying it here now they're never (76:51 - 76:57)
going to do Japan again as a world (76:55 - 76:58)
championship and they're never going to (76:57 - 77:01)
do it again they just can't this is such (76:58 - 77:03)
a disaster and it hasn't even happened I (77:01 - 77:06)
guarantee you I'm going to show up at (77:03 - 77:08)
4am in Japan time to record with Hannah (77:06 - 77:11)
and Greg and be like yup I couldn't get (77:08 - 77:13)
into anything (77:11 - 77:15)
I'm gonna tell you right now that like (77:13 - 77:18)
this is going to be a mess again (77:15 - 77:20)
disclosure the Pokemon company has paid (77:18 - 77:22)
for part of this trip for me I'm going (77:20 - 77:23)
to tell you right now it's going to be a (77:22 - 77:25)
mess they're never going to do Japan (77:23 - 77:27)
again (77:25 - 77:29)
there's no way (77:27 - 77:31)
how can they do so many in the United (77:29 - 77:34)
States and it be pretty fine even the (77:31 - 77:36)
one in London was fine the the one (77:34 - 77:38)
they're never gonna do Canada again by (77:36 - 77:39)
the way because the main reason with (77:38 - 77:40)
Canada and that they're never going to (77:39 - 77:41)
do is because literally half of their (77:40 - 77:44)
volunteers and judges got stopped at the (77:41 - 77:45)
border and couldn't get in they didn't (77:44 - 77:47)
have enough judges (77:45 - 77:49)
I mean they're never gonna do I can (77:47 - 77:50)
they're never gonna do anything more now (77:49 - 77:53)
than ever before I understand that (77:50 - 77:54)
worlds has been really good for a while (77:53 - 77:56)
but they're trying to do more and more (77:54 - 77:58)
each year last year was way more (77:56 - 78:00)
extravagant than DC was I went to DC (77:58 - 78:02)
there was some cool stuff and it was an (78:00 - 78:05)
a fantastic time but there was a ton of (78:02 - 78:07)
stuff all around the city last year and (78:05 - 78:09)
London as far as I could tell from the (78:07 - 78:10)
photos and this year in Japan with all (78:09 - 78:13)
of the events they're just trying to do (78:10 - 78:15)
so much and they're doing it poorly (78:13 - 78:18)
while they're also doing it the same (78:15 - 78:20)
time they would have done the Pikachu (78:18 - 78:21)
outbreak which is (78:20 - 78:24)
its own Festival (78:21 - 78:27)
which should have been separated (78:24 - 78:29)
is there not also a community day that (78:27 - 78:32)
weekend too oh yeah there is we don't (78:29 - 78:34)
know what it is technically (78:32 - 78:35)
like like (78:34 - 78:38)
cool you're gonna have thousands of (78:35 - 78:40)
people outside the conventions that are (78:38 - 78:42)
catching probably Froakie and while the (78:40 - 78:44)
world championship battles are actually (78:42 - 78:48)
like happening yeah (78:44 - 78:48)
they need to out like they need to hire (78:50 - 78:57)
an event company like whoever if they (78:53 - 78:59)
are using an event company now they need (78:57 - 79:02)
to not be using them and go to somebody (78:59 - 79:04)
else that knows how to run events (79:02 - 79:07)
this is like (79:04 - 79:09)
this is (79:07 - 79:14)
a PR reputation damaging event and (79:09 - 79:17)
people are not go are are not going to (79:14 - 79:20)
commit to another worlds (79:17 - 79:22)
next year until they know (79:20 - 79:24)
what are the rules (79:22 - 79:27)
when are you going to tell me I am not (79:24 - 79:29)
planning a trip so that I can go to a (79:27 - 79:32)
foreign city for this event to not (79:29 - 79:35)
partake in any part of that event if I (79:32 - 79:36)
wanted to go to Japan on a regular (79:35 - 79:38)
vacation I would I wouldn't have picked (79:36 - 79:40)
August I wouldn't depict August I went (79:38 - 79:42)
to pick this time I would have gone at a (79:40 - 79:45)
different time and planned differently (79:42 - 79:49)
that is crazy to me that people are like (79:45 - 79:51)
well you should just just appreciate you (79:49 - 79:53)
should be lucky enough that you're in (79:51 - 79:55)
Japan (79:53 - 79:58)
like I I could go to Japan yeah for half (79:55 - 80:01)
the cost yeah in a month that isn't (79:58 - 80:05)
blazing hot heat wave like what yep yeah (80:01 - 80:09)
I could also not go to Japan like your (80:05 - 80:11)
argument's like yeah I could have not (80:09 - 80:13)
done this too I wanted to go to an event (80:11 - 80:17)
that is important to me to the people (80:13 - 80:21)
that I spend time with and through (80:17 - 80:24)
really bad communication I am prevented (80:21 - 80:28)
from doing the thing that I had been (80:24 - 80:32)
looking for like in a lot of ways cool (80:28 - 80:33)
that I'm not going this like I would (80:32 - 80:36)
have gone if I still had (80:33 - 80:41)
a job I was planning on like in February (80:36 - 80:42)
I was planning a trip to Japan for this (80:41 - 80:44)
I lost my job and said well I don't know (80:42 - 80:46)
that I'll be able to afford it and now (80:44 - 80:47)
it's like cool (80:46 - 80:49)
I couldn't have done anything if I'd (80:47 - 80:51)
gone there anyways well you could have (80:49 - 80:54)
explored Japan I coulda with like but I (80:51 - 80:56)
wouldn't have brought Brent and I've (80:54 - 80:59)
been like with you and I'm like well (80:56 - 81:02)
yes that was good (80:59 - 81:03)
um (81:02 - 81:06)
yeah I I I don't know what the limit of (81:03 - 81:09)
people they're allowing in uh you know (81:06 - 81:12)
they they did sell out of normal passes (81:09 - 81:14)
at London they did sell out of passes at (81:12 - 81:17)
DC so they they do have limits (81:14 - 81:19)
um (81:17 - 81:21)
I don't know how close or how far away (81:19 - 81:25)
these events are I don't know like what (81:21 - 81:28)
is in the area of Yokohama I I'm not (81:25 - 81:29)
sure (81:28 - 81:32)
I'm also worried about like (81:29 - 81:34)
cell phone service right like are they (81:32 - 81:35)
gonna (81:34 - 81:39)
is something going to go down like there (81:35 - 81:43)
was a worry at NAIC that if they had a (81:39 - 81:46)
Pokemon unite free play area that that (81:43 - 81:48)
it would affect the internet on the main (81:46 - 81:49)
stage and they were just worried and (81:48 - 81:51)
they didn't think that the venue had (81:49 - 81:53)
enough internet to like support that and (81:51 - 81:54)
so they didn't want to like mess up (81:53 - 81:56)
anything on Main stage (81:54 - 81:58)
like what's gonna happen here (81:56 - 81:59)
I mean (81:58 - 82:03)
to be fair their cell service is vastly (81:59 - 82:06)
superior than almost anywhere else in (82:03 - 82:08)
the world (82:06 - 82:12)
um of of the people that devel cells (82:08 - 82:15)
that buy sell like everybody always buy (82:12 - 82:17)
all the companies buy what Japan has (82:15 - 82:20)
done right like they are always the Step (82:17 - 82:22)
Ahead almost every cell phone industry (82:20 - 82:24)
looks at Japan like okay what are they (82:22 - 82:27)
making next and when can we buy it (82:24 - 82:29)
um so like your service provided you (82:27 - 82:32)
have a phone that works in Japan will (82:29 - 82:34)
will be excellent can't speak their (82:32 - 82:36)
internet though like I don't know what (82:34 - 82:39)
their fiber options are like I don't (82:36 - 82:42)
know what their General Wi-Fi situation (82:39 - 82:44)
is but like as far as if you're sitting (82:42 - 82:46)
on a cell phone and you have a cell (82:44 - 82:50)
phone that will work in Japan it is not (82:46 - 82:53)
a guarantee on your phone that that will (82:50 - 82:55)
happen you do a need to check because (82:53 - 82:58)
they do use different frequencies than (82:55 - 83:01)
we do and if your phone doesn't pick up (82:58 - 83:03)
those frequencies it doesn't matter if (83:01 - 83:05)
you get a SIM card (83:03 - 83:08)
phone won't work (83:05 - 83:08)
if you have an iPhone you'll be fine (83:09 - 83:13)
yeah I mean most of them are available (83:10 - 83:16)
over there most of the big high-end (83:13 - 83:18)
devices will work now but they didn't in (83:16 - 83:21)
the past (83:18 - 83:21)
this is this this past year with the (83:21 - 83:25)
with you know how buggy scarlet and (83:23 - 83:28)
violet has been their tournament (83:25 - 83:31)
structure Korea just Banning their top (83:28 - 83:32)
players (83:31 - 83:37)
uh this event (83:32 - 83:37)
I think Greg is right they need to (83:37 - 83:42)
probably at this point hire like an (83:39 - 83:43)
event (83:42 - 83:46)
planning Studio like I can't imagine a (83:43 - 83:48)
world championship is bigger than like a (83:46 - 83:51)
San Diego Comic-Con not that San Diego (83:48 - 83:53)
Comic-Con is is run particularly well (83:51 - 83:57)
but it's it's it's run enough yeah you (83:53 - 83:58)
hear (83:57 - 84:02)
fewer complaints and the expectations of (83:58 - 84:04)
what like if you want to get into a (84:02 - 84:05)
certain panel you are sitting there for (84:04 - 84:07)
eight hours that is a well-stated (84:05 - 84:09)
expectation for San Diego Comic-Con (84:07 - 84:11)
right like if you want to see the Star (84:09 - 84:13)
Wars stuff (84:11 - 84:15)
get in line and it will happen at seven (84:13 - 84:17)
but you're getting there 12 hours ahead (84:15 - 84:19)
of time in hopes that you'll get in (84:17 - 84:22)
right like they're very honest about (84:19 - 84:24)
that stuff and I don't feel that that (84:22 - 84:28)
level of honesty and expectation is (84:24 - 84:31)
being done here and it is going it is (84:28 - 84:36)
hurting their brand after a year of a (84:31 - 84:39)
lot of hiccups (84:36 - 84:42)
uh speaking of Comic-Con uh the Pokemon (84:39 - 84:44)
Pokemon offered a sneak peek of the (84:42 - 84:47)
first Pokemon Horizon series episode and (84:44 - 84:48)

English with a special surprise uh for (85:10 - 85:14)
the panel (85:12 - 85:14)

foreign (85:23 - 85:27)

members of the Pokemon Community who has (85:32 - 85:35)
contributed making Pokemon animation a (85:33 - 85:37)
success to this day while providing a (85:35 - 85:38)

ultimate Journeys the series on Netflix (86:08 - 86:14)
which will launch on September 8th The (86:11 - 86:16)
Nostalgia will bring back fan favorite (86:14 - 86:18)
characters such as Misty and it's always (86:16 - 86:20)
Misty and Brock yeah we'll be providing (86:18 - 86:22)
a glimpse of the future of Ash Ketchum (86:20 - 86:24)
and his Pikachu in his final chapter of (86:22 - 86:26)
their 25 season Journey (86:24 - 86:30)
um and they showed a trailer for that (86:26 - 86:32)
so those were the two things that they (86:30 - 86:34)
shown (86:32 - 86:36)
um I guess the (86:34 - 86:38)
the (86:36 - 86:41)
thing that a maybe an average or casual (86:38 - 86:44)
Pokemon fan will learn from this is (86:41 - 86:47)
Sarah natokeni the voice of Ash is back (86:44 - 86:51)
uh and she is playing Roy (86:47 - 86:55)
uh which is the dude with the Fuego (86:51 - 86:58)
the male main character yep did I they (86:55 - 87:01)
probably said who the the person for uh (86:58 - 87:03)
the girl was but I I don't have that in (87:01 - 87:06)
front of me (87:03 - 87:06)
I can't remember her name no not Leah (87:07 - 87:12)
Lico (87:09 - 87:12)
and the 10 minutes was cool yeah I mean (87:12 - 87:18)
I'm excited it (87:15 - 87:20)
um knowing (87:18 - 87:23)
nothing about it I was a bit surprised (87:20 - 87:26)
at the first 10 minutes I'm like (87:23 - 87:28)
oh oh (87:26 - 87:34)
why okay this is not at all okay it's (87:28 - 87:38)
different yep sure is (87:34 - 87:38)
I'm really excited for it we still don't (87:39 - 87:44)
know when it's coming out nope yeah nope (87:41 - 87:47)
what's frustrating like okay so you have (87:44 - 87:50)
so you have you you have the voice (87:47 - 87:54)
actors you have it done it is completed (87:50 - 87:56)
we don't have a date we don't have (87:54 - 87:59)
anything we don't even get the final of (87:56 - 88:02)
Ash's Journey until September 8th which (87:59 - 88:04)
means chances are we're not getting that (88:02 - 88:06)
this year because they generally don't (88:04 - 88:09)
do things around they don't start new (88:06 - 88:11)
series around Christmas (88:09 - 88:13)
they tend to wait until mid-January (88:11 - 88:15)
beginning of February to do anything new (88:13 - 88:17)
because of or September (88:15 - 88:19)
or September (88:17 - 88:22)
so (88:19 - 88:22)
also I don't recognize the voice actress (88:23 - 88:29)
of of Lika I looked it up (88:25 - 88:30)
are they not a voice actor of other (88:29 - 88:32)
animists they are (88:30 - 88:35)
um Winx Club and Castlevania the TV (88:32 - 88:38)
series are listed I don't recognize (88:35 - 88:40)
I have not I have not watched either of (88:38 - 88:42)
those that's all that I'm seeing is (88:40 - 88:45)
listed as their voice act uh uh do you (88:42 - 88:48)
think voice credits Alejandra Reynoso is (88:45 - 88:51)
is the person's name (88:48 - 88:54)
do you think Sarah took a pay cut do you (88:51 - 88:57)
think going from like not being the main (88:54 - 88:59)
character I mean I guess maybe Roy is (88:57 - 89:02)
the main character but like (88:59 - 89:04)
this has nothing to do with the news (89:02 - 89:08)
it's just like me being nosy so (89:04 - 89:11)
in general voice actors aren't treated (89:08 - 89:13)
like main actors of a television series (89:11 - 89:15)
like they don't tend to get preferential (89:13 - 89:18)
above oh okay contract like it depends (89:15 - 89:20)
on what the contract is that she signed (89:18 - 89:22)
it but it's not like (89:20 - 89:25)
like Tara Strong can sometimes ask for (89:22 - 89:28)
more money but they tend not to get a (89:25 - 89:30)
lot more money because they are voice (89:28 - 89:32)
actors and it's usually set at at (89:30 - 89:36)
whatever the contract they sign is so it (89:32 - 89:39)
is possible she has a better contract it (89:36 - 89:43)
is probably not likely given the fact (89:39 - 89:46)
that they're all on strike for this very (89:43 - 89:48)
reason (89:46 - 89:50)
um that that that she's not (89:48 - 89:54)
I doubt the fact that she's playing a (89:50 - 89:56)
different character because most likely (89:54 - 89:59)
she is playing multiple characters like (89:56 - 90:02)
she always has right oh yeah she might (89:59 - 90:05)
be like wulu or so she's probably got a (90:02 - 90:09)
base i i a higher than base rate for (90:05 - 90:11)
years of experience in working with the (90:09 - 90:14)
company but it's not like you lost a (90:11 - 90:15)
hundred thousand dollars because you're (90:14 - 90:17)
not Ash anymore (90:15 - 90:19)
yeah yeah (90:17 - 90:21)
I feel like that's like the thing is (90:19 - 90:23)
like even if she wasn't Roy which I (90:21 - 90:25)
think Roy is probably a pretty big (90:23 - 90:29)
character right obviously but if like (90:25 - 90:32)
she was you know just like Bulbasaur (90:29 - 90:35)
Mareep and Squirtle they would be like (90:32 - 90:37)
well you know you're not Ash anymore (90:35 - 90:39)
you're just the Bulbasaur you're so like (90:37 - 90:40)
yeah you know we're not gonna and again (90:39 - 90:43)
they generally probably only pay for the (90:40 - 90:46)
amount of work that they do like how (90:43 - 90:48)
many hours they put in (90:46 - 90:52)
it's weird because again it's the acting (90:48 - 90:54)
world the re everybody wants to get a (90:52 - 90:55)
line in the movie because they have to (90:54 - 90:57)
pay you more if you speak that's why I (90:55 - 90:59)
know background actors are allowed to (90:57 - 91:01)
speak like they are forbidden and they (90:59 - 91:03)
are given very specific things because (91:01 - 91:05)
you get a higher pay if you have a (91:03 - 91:08)
speaking line than not (91:05 - 91:10)
um it's a voice work and stuff really (91:08 - 91:12)
depends on how much they're having you (91:10 - 91:14)
do like there is a big voice work strike (91:12 - 91:17)
a while ago because they did consider (91:14 - 91:20)
doing things like in video game things (91:17 - 91:22)
like the ouches and the grunts and the (91:20 - 91:24)
Sops like they were gonna pay them more (91:22 - 91:26)
for that and it's much harder to do on (91:24 - 91:28)
people's voices so they had to do a (91:26 - 91:31)
whole new contract negotiation of what (91:28 - 91:33)
you make us do with our voices should (91:31 - 91:36)
get paid more it's a it's complicated (91:33 - 91:39)
but they don't pay a ton like they are (91:36 - 91:41)
really like (91:39 - 91:44)
we're phoning a lot of this in (91:41 - 91:46)
as of right now as of this recording (91:44 - 91:48)
there are 14 episodes of Pokemon (91:46 - 91:52)
Horizons it debuted in Japan on April (91:48 - 91:54)
14th (91:52 - 91:56)
and (91:54 - 92:00)
uh it's been a while since Ash has won (91:56 - 92:02)
uh I guess that just technically (92:00 - 92:04)
happened in the United States like what (92:02 - 92:07)
two weeks ago on Netflix (92:04 - 92:09)
uh (92:07 - 92:11)
uh but yeah we don't know when this is (92:09 - 92:15)
coming to the rest of the world (92:11 - 92:19)
so that's cool I guess (92:15 - 92:19)
and who knows if uh (92:19 - 92:26)
they recorded like five episodes and now (92:23 - 92:28)
they can't record any because of the (92:26 - 92:30)
strikes (92:28 - 92:30)
um I don't think that the voice acting (92:30 - 92:37)
studio who's running theirs is part of (92:35 - 92:40)
the companies that are being (92:37 - 92:43)
struck also (92:40 - 92:46)
much like a to a said we agree to all of (92:43 - 92:50)
your terms and signed a new contract (92:46 - 92:51)
like they are still allowed to make (92:50 - 92:54)
things so like if your studio agreed to (92:51 - 92:56)
all of the terms that are part of the (92:54 - 92:58)
strike they're allowed to go to move (92:56 - 93:01)
forward it's it's very complicated (92:58 - 93:03)
um but chances are like I didn't when I (93:01 - 93:05)
looked at the the major ones that are (93:03 - 93:07)
being that are being targeted right now (93:05 - 93:11)
I don't think the Voice studios that are (93:07 - 93:15)
doing these are part of the strike (93:11 - 93:15)
not yet at least they could jump on not (93:16 - 93:21)
yet it could happen at any at any moment (93:18 - 93:23)
look UPS goes on strike and the world's (93:21 - 93:24)
going to come just screeching halt so (93:23 - 93:28)
it's the summer for it (93:24 - 93:28)
can't wait for all the uh Pokemon cards (93:29 - 93:35)
not to be delivered to Yokohama yeah (93:31 - 93:35)
um (93:36 - 93:40)
yeah so I don't know (93:36 - 93:42)
I I'm I'm gonna guess that this is still (93:40 - 93:45)
a Netflix deal if they're oh I'm sure (93:42 - 93:48)
the weird thing is is like they could (93:45 - 93:51)
also just (93:48 - 93:51)
stop going to Netflix and just go (93:51 - 93:55)
straight to the YouTube channel (93:53 - 93:59)
like they have this option depending (93:55 - 94:01)
what the contract says so I'm curious (93:59 - 94:03)
this reaches more people though yeah (94:01 - 94:04)
true (94:03 - 94:06)
kind of how many times are you on (94:04 - 94:08)
Netflix and you're like I need to put (94:06 - 94:10)
something on (94:08 - 94:13)
I mean I think less than I used to I (94:10 - 94:15)
think that's a lot less than people (94:13 - 94:17)
think because it is like a completely (94:15 - 94:21)
separate app like I think with big shows (94:17 - 94:22)
if they want to go independent like if (94:21 - 94:24)
Pokemon company said find everything (94:22 - 94:27)
like their their Standalone cartoons did (94:24 - 94:30)
really well too like and it's only on (94:27 - 94:32)
YouTube so I think I think Pokemon would (94:30 - 94:34)
I think (94:32 - 94:37)
I think Pokemon would still reach (94:34 - 94:40)
new or more people on Netflix and if (94:37 - 94:42)
Netflix didn't want to pay (94:40 - 94:45)
or another company like Disney like they (94:42 - 94:47)
were on Disney at one point (94:45 - 94:49)
um wanted to pay like there's there's (94:47 - 94:51)
still like a value in (94:49 - 94:53)
moving your brand between things to get (94:51 - 94:57)
money at this point like I'm not I'm not (94:53 - 95:00)
a Disney I'm not Disney boy never have (94:57 - 95:03)
been a big Disney fan but I I have been (95:00 - 95:06)
hard-pressed to meet a parent with kids (95:03 - 95:09)
who do not have Disney plus yep because (95:06 - 95:10)
like they need to put something on for (95:09 - 95:11)
their children (95:10 - 95:14)
the thing is is like a lot of these (95:11 - 95:16)
contracts are less about money for the (95:14 - 95:19)
Pokemon company and more about the (95:16 - 95:22)
streaming service that has them (95:19 - 95:25)
um so Disney wanted more control because (95:22 - 95:27)
Disney always wants more control and so (95:25 - 95:29)
they ended that contract right like you (95:27 - 95:31)
don't you don't get to control our (95:29 - 95:34)
product and so Netflix didn't Netflix (95:31 - 95:36)
isn't investing money into this Netflix (95:34 - 95:39)
is purchasing the rights to show it so (95:36 - 95:43)
Netflix can make a lot of money (95:39 - 95:43)
like they could easily go to Amazon (95:50 - 95:54)
Prime like they could check this thing (95:51 - 95:57)
around because it's it's not about like (95:54 - 96:00)
the cartoons are being made (95:57 - 96:02)
outside of who's streaming them in (96:00 - 96:04)
America (96:02 - 96:04)
um okay uh Roots have launched in (96:04 - 96:08)
Pokemon go although we're running really (96:07 - 96:10)
long and I don't think any of us have (96:08 - 96:13)
experienced a root (96:10 - 96:15)
I haven't been able to find any I went (96:13 - 96:17)
all over my City yesterday and wasn't (96:15 - 96:20)
able to see a single one I've tried to (96:17 - 96:22)
make them though I forgot to look (96:20 - 96:26)
keyword on tried (96:22 - 96:26)
nearby (96:26 - 96:31)
uh Niantic gave me access to Roots a (96:27 - 96:32)
while ago but then they said don't make (96:31 - 96:34)
any because it's not out (96:32 - 96:37)
yes okay okay kind of recently they (96:34 - 96:40)
started giving more players access to it (96:37 - 96:42)
I was one of the players who got access (96:40 - 96:43)
to (96:42 - 96:46)
potentially try and make routes somewhat (96:43 - 96:48)
recently like in the last month (96:46 - 96:49)
um (96:48 - 96:52)
I really tried I have ever since they (96:49 - 96:54)
announced this feature I had this one (96:52 - 96:56)
particular Forest path (96:54 - 96:58)
that I really wanted to make into a (96:56 - 97:00)
route because it was the path that I (96:58 - 97:02)
would walk every week in college and it (97:00 - 97:04)
got my head on straight (97:02 - 97:08)
um it improved my week every week and I (97:04 - 97:09)
wanted to make sure that all of the new (97:08 - 97:11)
college students who played Pokemon go (97:09 - 97:13)
would be able to find this path (97:11 - 97:16)
and would maybe get credit and find (97:13 - 97:18)
extra Pokemon for a walking through this (97:16 - 97:19)
Forest path and I thought that it would (97:18 - 97:23)
be a great experience unfortunately it's (97:19 - 97:24)
really hard to get there now that I (97:23 - 97:27)
don't go to that college anymore it took (97:24 - 97:29)
an hour on the bus and then another hour (97:27 - 97:32)
to walk from the bus to the forest (97:29 - 97:35)
to walk another two hours to go through (97:32 - 97:37)
this whole path and make it try to make (97:35 - 97:39)
it a route in Pokemon go and then I (97:37 - 97:41)
additionally tried to make another route (97:39 - 97:44)
that was from the college to the forest (97:41 - 97:46)
path so that people who were on the (97:44 - 97:48)
college campus could see hey there's a (97:46 - 97:49)
route this goes to a cool Forest path (97:48 - 97:51)
maybe I'll take it (97:49 - 97:54)
and by the time I got home (97:51 - 97:56)
they had both been rejected (97:54 - 97:57)
what (97:56 - 98:01)
did they say why they were rejected nope (97:57 - 98:04)
it was an entire day's investment trying (98:01 - 98:05)
to do this thing that I thought would be (98:04 - 98:08)
really positive for a lot of people (98:05 - 98:11)
immediately rejected and I (98:08 - 98:13)
apparently there was some sort of bug (98:11 - 98:16)
and I may try again but I I haven't (98:13 - 98:18)
wanted to try to make any more routes (98:16 - 98:20)
after that valid (98:18 - 98:23)
I I'm gonna try because I want this to (98:20 - 98:25)
be a positive feature and I think it has (98:23 - 98:27)
potential but there are almost no routes (98:25 - 98:30)
out there right now (98:27 - 98:32)
so what I'm gonna do is look up (98:30 - 98:35)
historical walking paths and try to make (98:32 - 98:37)
those into routes because (98:35 - 98:40)
I don't know what else to do I don't (98:37 - 98:43)
have a super big park nearby me (98:40 - 98:46)
I it takes it takes two hours to get to (98:43 - 98:48)
this one place that I wanted to make a (98:46 - 98:51)
route in and it didn't work (98:48 - 98:53)
I don't know I think the feature has (98:51 - 98:55)
potential I think it is launched (98:53 - 98:57)
extremely poorly (98:55 - 98:59)
because you can get Zygarde now and (98:57 - 99:01)
theoretically you can get the things to (98:59 - 99:05)
change zygarde's forms but nobody can (99:01 - 99:08)
find them because nobody can find routes (99:05 - 99:10)
and even when you find a route it's not (99:08 - 99:11)
guaranteed (99:10 - 99:13)
Niantic should hire some more people (99:11 - 99:19)
yeah yeah they they really should (99:13 - 99:22)
uh okay me too and unite Greg yes let's (99:19 - 99:25)
hear it uh second anniversary is here uh (99:22 - 99:27)
the new tower defense tinkerton thing is (99:25 - 99:30)
super fun but kind of really easy once (99:27 - 99:33)
you've done it enough it's not hard to (99:30 - 99:35)
I've done the most extreme version with (99:33 - 99:38)
randoms seven times now we've never (99:35 - 99:42)
failed it uh Mewtwo guess what they had (99:38 - 99:45)
a live letter that said hey we learned (99:42 - 99:47)
from zashian and zashian really broke (99:45 - 99:48)
the game so we're never gonna do that (99:47 - 99:50)
again and we're super super sorry and (99:48 - 99:53)
then they released me too and we're like (99:50 - 99:56)
everybody's like oh it's exactly as bad (99:53 - 100:01)
as ashian was you learned surprise but (99:56 - 100:01)
we messed up we are putting it in an (100:05 - 100:10)
emergency hot fix for Mewtwo and they (100:08 - 100:14)
did now people are mad because Mewtwo (100:10 - 100:16)
still feels overpowered and every new (100:14 - 100:20)
Pokemon that comes out particularly (100:16 - 100:23)
legendaries they have said in the things (100:20 - 100:26)
we want them to be slightly overtuned (100:23 - 100:28)
and feel like you're getting a strong (100:26 - 100:32)
value from this new Pokemon like a (100:28 - 100:35)
legendary should feel legendary and (100:32 - 100:38)
after the tune-up Mewtwo still does feel (100:35 - 100:42)
strong but it was not like (100:38 - 100:44)
the bulldozer it was when it first (100:42 - 100:46)
released and I will say like everybody (100:44 - 100:49)
was super mad and it's valid (100:46 - 100:52)
I give them huge amounts of credits for (100:49 - 100:54)
the exact same day putting in an (100:52 - 100:56)
immediate hot fix saying (100:54 - 100:59)
hey we overtuned it it was working (100:56 - 101:02)
differently on the play test when it hit (100:59 - 101:04)
live they had cranked everything up way (101:02 - 101:06)
too much and they turned it down so (101:04 - 101:08)
kudos to them (101:06 - 101:10)
um it is Mewtwo X (101:08 - 101:13)
Mewtwo Y (101:10 - 101:16)
is coming in three weeks they are very (101:13 - 101:21)
different play Styles Mewtwo X is a (101:16 - 101:24)
melee brawler so up in your face the (101:21 - 101:27)
mechanic is very interesting you gain (101:24 - 101:32)
Mega Power by fighting and then you (101:27 - 101:34)
immediately become mega form for a short (101:32 - 101:36)
amount of time and then go back to (101:34 - 101:39)
normal Mewtwo y will be a ranged (101:36 - 101:41)
attacker (101:39 - 101:42)
um we don't know exactly how it plays it (101:41 - 101:45)
should be hitting the plus the the play (101:42 - 101:48)
test server in I think a week or so (101:45 - 101:49)
um (101:48 - 101:53)
and then all the two-year anniversary (101:49 - 101:54)
stuff is just as good as the first (101:53 - 101:57)
anniversary stuff there's lots to do (101:54 - 101:59)
um I really wish they would have made (101:57 - 102:01)
tinkerton a playable character it's not (101:59 - 102:04)
it does all three Evolutions in the (102:01 - 102:06)
tower defense thing they did all the (102:04 - 102:09)
models they did all the attacks you just (102:06 - 102:11)
can't play Tinker done but uh it's (102:09 - 102:13)
pretty fun they've never turned a (102:11 - 102:15)
Pokemon that was an NPC into a playable (102:13 - 102:19)
nope not yet (102:15 - 102:21)
and they've added they've added a lot of (102:19 - 102:23)
Pokemon to Tower Defense that aren't (102:21 - 102:26)
anywhere else so you fight belly bolts (102:23 - 102:29)
you fight a lowland Persians in a (102:26 - 102:34)
lowland mouths you fight uh (102:29 - 102:34)
you fight (102:34 - 102:41)
um flamigos like you fight a lot of pal (102:38 - 102:44)
day in Pokemon in this thing and also (102:41 - 102:47)
you fight some (102:44 - 102:50)
mobs that are playable characters so (102:47 - 102:53)
there is a slight hope that you that (102:50 - 102:54)
some of these might become playable (102:53 - 102:56)
characters because in Tower Defense (102:54 - 102:59)
Greninja Gardevoir Mew (102:56 - 103:02)
all these things show up and act like (102:59 - 103:05)
players they're run by the computers but (103:02 - 103:06)
you know they're they're Bots that (103:05 - 103:08)
they're kind of tough to deal with but (103:06 - 103:10)
like it's a very interesting mix so (103:08 - 103:12)
there's a slight hope (103:10 - 103:14)
that maybe some of these Pokemon that (103:12 - 103:17)
they're enclosing might jump over into (103:14 - 103:19)
Plato goes but we know that blaziken's (103:17 - 103:20)
coming next anyways like they've already (103:19 - 103:23)
announced after there's like Mewtwo X (103:20 - 103:26)
Blaziken Mewtwo Y maybe something else (103:23 - 103:28)
in between but like you sort of know the (103:26 - 103:30)
progression for the next month and a (103:28 - 103:32)
half (103:30 - 103:32)

and there are more roots that exist or (103:41 - 103:46)
or whatnot but (103:44 - 103:49)
uh uh there was also a makeup Squirtle (103:46 - 103:53)
Community today because that broke so (103:49 - 103:55)

I barely did it this month the first (104:00 - 104:03)
