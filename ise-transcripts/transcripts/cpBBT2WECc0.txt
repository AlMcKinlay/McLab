[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390 ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host s BJ my jaw hurts still but what Greg is here I think I should actually do because I'm a monster and I ate some stale skittles wait and I couldn't stop eating them and then I think I popped my jaw from it now how long did you have these skittles let's not talk about that the skittles are an eternal food ya know they're still good they're just a little they're just a lot harder than they should be yeah you are such a trash Panda I know I was like yeah that was kind of hard and then the bag live around the corner for a convenience store where you can very easily pick up a fresh bag of Skittles expensive you're wagering that that convenience store has fresh skittles oh I mean if it doesn't have skittles it's gonna have some other fruit flavored based candy rinse bronze nobody wants runs runs Craig's here Will's here yeah I had something funny I was gonna say but then I forgot what it was so y'all suffer till next week something about sunshine and Pat oh yes I was going to say life is full of Kenny tiny frustrations but you if you greet them all with a cheerful disposition then they have failed and you can relish in their failure there's your wisdom for the week so like skittles yeah now they stop but if you say yeah I hurt my job with them if you say it with a smile then that whole effort of those bestest skittles to ruin your day has been destroyed and you've ruined their life and made them miserable I mean apart from the fact that you can't smile because you broke your jaw eating busted old skittles look if you're smiling with your jaw you're doing it wrong smiles all about the lips you smile with your whole face or you're not smiling we have to work that's how you get wrinkles that's how you live a good life those laughs wrinkles or wrinkled life not as much news this week as the last eight weeks when Wyatt time yeah we're on the quiet ever since sword and shield done we were we felt like we were drowning in news but this is a little bit of a lighter week we got some news to go through and then next week is our 400th episode pretty big miles 100th spectacular so if you're listening to this on youtube right now you can leave a comment and a question for the 400th episode and if you visit our subreddit leave a question slash comment on the episode thread when it goes up and we already have a bunch of really great questions from last week that we will merge with questions from this week and if you want to do the phone number thing that will be inserted in one of the break music things that we have so stay tuned for that well we're just gonna jump right into news only because I want to close my phone and this is the only way I can read this news from my phone what okay I don't know something's been cancelled there you go the ball pit it's not the ball pit let's news oh good thing I took a screenshot of it because once this maintenance completed they deleted the maintenance message good thing I screen change just about the hey get your meteor kinda so this was posted on a March 4th and it says thank you for using Pokemon home this message is to inform you that your system maintenance has been scheduled for the following time period during maintenance all features of Pokemon home will become unavailable and that is between 1:30 to 8:00 UTC on March 6 so this just happened that says the fix would be in all bold in all underline a fix for the issue with the gift presented to players who have completed their national pokedex is before 11:00 a.m. UTC on Friday February 14th 2020 there were issues with previous gifts that were distributed and so the correct gift will be sent to eligible players gift boxes after maintenance concludes those who already received an incorrect gift she changes made to their data to fix the situation I have a lot of questions Shirley why don't you hit me with your question okay if we are what was the incorrect give you a Sun curd a correct gift was regular Magana oh the gear 'no of other color you're supposed to get a shiny McGee Rena no you were supposed to get original form like which is not shiny not pokeball macaron huh that is pokeball McKenna original a lot really original form on all over okay yeah original form is the Polka ball one and then McGee runner from Sun and Moon is the silver and pink one and then the McGee erna from the anime that lily has is the shiny silver and pink one and then the black and gold one is the shiny of the original form Agena which is the pokeball one that all made sense right no we're all following if I I made a graphic to clearly lay this out for people because I'm Kira yes I put it on Instagram I put on Twitter because a lot of people thought that the pokeball my gear and it was the shiny my gear down but it's not the shiny my gear now but that so if you complete your polka if you get all 890 Pokemon and I get this all the time I say if you get all 890 pokemon and the first question is from everyone is does that include mythical if you get all 880 Foca mom ever every single one from 0:01 to 890 witches California nope it's a turn at this and if you have them all in Pokemon home you are supposed to get a original form pokeball looking Miggy Erna but it's been broken some people got regular Miggy Erna and some people got eight regular Miggy or nut and some people got like four regular Miggy Erna and some people got McGee Erna regular mugear not with a the happy birthday ribbon on it I didn't believe that until they provided me a screen shot I don't I don't know why because it was obviously broken some people have gotten the original form Miggy Erna by shifting their boxes left and right to trigger it but in the in this maintenance update that they since removed because I guess maintenance was complete it does say there is an issue where the system failed to correctly reckon recognize whether a pokedex was and then it gets cut off because I didn't take a screenshot of the rest of that but ultimately I'll sum it up because I'm reading it pretty much in this maintenance update it says that they are aware that there's an issue where Pokemon home is not recognizing a complete pokedex so therefore it doesn't give you original form McNerney even if you have a complete pokedex and so in this up maintenance update on March 4th the bottom of it says we've acknowledged that the Pokedex is not registering all the pokemon and we will fix this in a future update so this is the first time they've acknowledged that some people are not getting their Magana because the Pokedex isn't registering but as of right now pokemon home is updated to one point zero point ten which should be your latest version and that server update has been implemented I don't think so I guess we'll have to find out if you're in slack or discord or on Twitter if you want to let us know if you didn't get original mcgahren to the first time and you got regular Magana did they take your original McGee away they give you a new one did you still not get it I actually don't have a large enough pool to figure that out I've been told by one person that they got eight original Magee Rinna or eight normal Magee Rinna the silver ones and they didn't take him away eight yeah I don't know because he's broken I look I don't I haven't know McGee Rinna because I haven't tried to get the pokeball McGee on it yet I mean I it's still there saying that I've only completed three days home so I'm waiting for that fixed weird because mine like four days in said I had completed ten days of home so yeah obviously not trying hard enough maybe I'm in it all the time yeah it's interesting how the server sees different phones at different days because I've been at five days of using Pokemon home since like day two yeah I mean I said I even sent them uh I sent in a bug report saying hey that's broken and they not gotten back to me I am curious if by the pot time this podcast goes up I'm pretty sure every Monday evening an update for Pokemon Home has come out I'd have to look at the calendar but I'm pretty sure ten point the one point zero point ten came out just hours after will not hours but like twelve hours after our podcast came out and it seems that every Monday evening an update is available so I don't know maybe I mean again we've talked about this before Pokemon bank was out for seven plus years in that lifetime only got four updates you know put waited for Pokemon they've had no wild promises with Bank exactly Pokemon Home has been out for about a month now and I'm just cost a thousand more headaches [Laughter] it's had about ten updates I actually like the way they do the Wonder trade I like how it's pretty much it seems like it's twice a day you put pokemon in in the morning you get new pokemon in the afternoon you put pokemon in in the in the evening you wake up to pokemon in the morning it seems that's that's the system it's doing I mean it's probably possible to get Pokemon the Wonder trade to probably trigger three times a day but they seem to be activating it on some sort of schedule yeah I haven't done it in a bit I almost feel like Pokemon is against people having like non-randomized trades anymore because in the past week I had to trade some Pokemon with a friend of mine and the conversation went like this can we trade our Pokemon and poke him on home he said no Pokemon home doesn't support remote trades and they said well what about the room trey is like no that's not for two people it doesn't work we have to do it in sword and shield and then we went in a sword and shield and it literally took us an hour to get the codes to match up ah I literally were you connected to the Internet or did where you connected luckily I'm connected locally and like I can't find oh no no no and and it's like I matched with codes with other people before I matched with friend and they're like this you got to stop using one one one two I use five eight eight nine so come on whoo stop everybody else stop using five eight eight nine is mine I have my own secret code that a that has worked every time yeah my code has worked every time - what's your code I'm not telling you I'll tell you my secret code the ISE secret code here it is zero one one one it's just Irene's birthday uh-huh but no one starts off with a zero because the zeros at the bottom people only start off with a one cuz they're lazy life hack there you go zero one one right also Goulding's pokedex yeah you know I was in I was in Boston Boston uh you're having a tea party a car I was getting my credit card wait you getting chowder chowder I love Boston accents so much Greg I really do I know you do I'm such a sucker for it but I met multiple people and thank you for saying hi to me at PAX I really appreciate it you were packed for a half a second I was I was but the entire time I walked away from the person and I got back to my friend's house I was staying with Nick who does the music for the show I was like oh dang I could have used Pokemon home and I could have traded people I could have done I've never done the GPS betrayed Pokemon you can't trade people that's illegal I didn't have a pole staying next to the person in trade with them thing and I forgot I've done it is it cool is exactly the same like every other trade secrets alright if you've done it in Pokemon go you've done it no is that like there's like a special screen that says hey you're finally near somebody congratulations it's let's trade these balls heck yeah so I'm about let's do a Pokemon home update I'm about sixty Pokemon away from 890 I'm missing I actually have them all but I the Pokemon that I'm that I need the 60 that I'm missing or all that I do have I have them in black - white - but I can't move them from black to white - because I'm trying to get a complete pokedex in that game because I want the shiny charm which was introduced in black and white - in that game first so I can't commit to moving this Pokemon so I have to recap those sixties so I'm missing missing a lot of middle evolution starters which you know I have M bores I have samurais I have Typhlosion 's but I can't breed them in sword and shield so I have to figure out how to do that in Sun and Moon and then move them up which is fine a little bit of a hassle but fine I'm missing you know the classic pokémon like delcatty and or sorry not lkd glammy ow and and / ugly because they've only been available in like two games ever in the Pokemon industry and then I'm missing Landorus and kiram are probably the two Legendary's I'm missing which I can get both those in sword I can but get both those in a game called ultra Sun altar moon if I didn't move my zekrom and rush room or my thunderous and tornados up into sword and shield so now I have fooled ya I messed up so now I have to use a different copy of Sun and Moon to get the Landorus or sorry to get a thunderous and dazed tornadoes to then move to my other copy - then find a wormhole that has a Landorus so everything I'm missing the 60 Pokemon I'm missing or extremely doable but what is what does your guys's progress on your your complete pokedex so I'm still working on my living decks in sword and shield I the wild area befuddles me it's so good I do have at this point all of the eeveelutions from the lake of outrage except for Oh gracious me who comes before SB on I'm got vapor man flare yeah I'm beauty items after it I've got its oh I think Jolteon is the one I'm missing Jolteon watch strikes again yeah the thunderstorm over there and that diamond often yeah and I have to evolve mana but I don't have a moonstone and it's hard to get those I have about 500 you want one I'm stone I can trade you one yeah I got I spent about three hours turbo controlling the digging guy do you do the pick up the stone in the lake about right down that you can't get the members down but you can't again stone from there no those are just the fire water no you can get pretty much everything else except for moons really yeah moon stones I think Moon and Sun stones you can only get off Solrock and lunatone mmm and the digging guys and the digger dudes which I don't patronize their business I find them Baiju sketchy I use them whenever I remember to use them which isn't a lot but happens I had somebody ask me the other day if they thought using a turbo controller to talk to the digging duo over and over was considered cheating or if using a turbo controller to talk to careless over and over was considered cheating and I said if anything it's actually considered probably smart financially because your pro controller which is like a $70 controller is only prorated for so many button presses true hmm you don't want to wear out your a button just because you're trying to get moonstones wait wait there's you just the way you just said that there's not a character in the game called careless yeah what yeah para careless careless is her nose the the fossils she's the one that's crying I just give me any two fossils I'll figure it out I never paid attention to her name it's actually pretty clever yeah it is here turns out I didn't do the volcanion event oh I don't think I don't have a volcania let me check nope let me check my Pokemon home that I can check on my phone Greg I don't have to turn on a Nintendo device in order to let you know how do you know there isn't a Nintendo device let me now that works out for you sir yeah cuz it should be an X Y Omega alpha sapphire and it's in there's two of them - I got root there's none of my copies in there so I'm like I missed that one I guess but it's like the rarest most hard to have Pokemon right narrow or arshad or is there aura really yeah there was only one event in the United States for it I only have one volcanion it is from the Helen volcanion which I believe was the X&Y one I hate using the keyboard on my phone oh I lied that there was only one volcanion distributions only once it's and it is the OT Helen ID numbers 0 1 0 0 16 yep holding an assault vest it was October 10th 2016 2 October 31st 2016 so yeah I missed a 21 days wait I don't have that line 30 in home on the phone I have my volcanion up it's right under the ability it'll say ability water absorbed nature in fish oh oh t Helen there you go yeah I missed it great when I'm standing next to you you can borrow it and I you can send it right on back although it turns out that I thought I only had one Zehra aura I may have found a second one hidden amongst my hidden amongst my many 3ds just lying here on maybe you can how did I only get one of these you know many copies of X&Y and I'm so mad at my I'm so confused too cuz I just have to wait two pulls of this had even when Game Stop was being real jerky about giving her out about multiple codes yeah it could have been a dumb thing to wear I got like 18 codes from them but I only redeemed a one and then I forgot to redeem the other that sound that right that's probably true I also lost my other 3ds I'm pretty sure I brought it with me when I moved so if anybody knows where it is I think I lost my copy of black hmm I could lost my copy of white - at Steve's house cuz he keeps conveniently forgetting to give it to me I gave it back to you it's probably in that 3d back to you the day before Pokemon go fests because we went down early to meet up you remember the deal and we got Giordano's and then I took a picture of a Sableye and the street and I posted our Instagram and then we came back and then we went down to go fast the next day I remember that night I was there he also met up with Patrick yes and they they got a shiny Hound our yes no sorry shiny Poochyena yeah that's right I also fight so my copy of emerald was saying hey the battery's dried out so it doesn't do day events anymore so I thought Oh everything's stuck on there it's not and I finally moved my first ever shiny Rosalia from emerald all the way up to Bank and now I have to eat it from bank in how many how many ribbons he Gavin that none haha throw it away no ribbons don't matter yeah nobody's I've been dude I love the Wrigley apparently I have somewhere in this house the Jirachi bonus disc Preda game Keys just bought one weii you should talk to me no no well but Micah has won it was one of the few games I was missing from my collection Oh somebody on that said they had both and they offered to sell it to me for a discounted price than eBay so I took advantage of it so I should be getting it hopefully on Monday but yes I am missing I'm missing wishmaker jirachi I think I have that disc in this house so I need to figure out how to do that again also I think I think I have a whole swath of Pokemon trapped in Pokemon ranch I'm I we you I need that I need to rescue I need the moon from the Pope my Pokemon ranch why is it a special mute it has a different note II I don't remember that Mew from my Pokemon or ranch forgive my keyboard clicks the I can't remember what her name cuz how many do you have to have in there to get 999 yeah that's why I never did it I mean I suppose I could I could just sit in Dimond and breed until I could so you got two there are two special Pokemon you can get by from my Pokemon ranch I'm so mad that I don't have somebody stole so somebody stole wills d/s somebody stole Greg's I don't know what you said Greg something nothing somebody stole my we I don't have no more threw it away I did not throw away my we I've seen my Pokemon ranches on my Wii U on the Wii side yeah did you migrate your Wii to your Wii U coz then it's all there yeah but I never bought my Pokemon ranch originally oh and then they closed the store so you can buy it anymore also right miss Delaney has my wii u right now but that doesn't help me I need I need okay if you're if you're a listener that has my Pokemon a ranch on a Nintendo Wii and you don't want your Nintendo Wii anymore I'm very interested in purchasing said we with my pokemon ranch on it because I want to get these special foot one it's hailey her name is hailey by the way I also never got my pokémon other pokémon box destiny work box yeah you have you know how well it's a very cheap game Greg I will buy it off of you 421 gift for Pokemon mom post boxes like a UH like a $600 game right now hires Pokemon box six hundred dollars because because they printed like zero to no copies in the United States because it was a complete flop except for the one that greg has and so it is Pokemon box not to be confused with Pokemon banker Pokemon home Pokemon box it's called uh the actual name is Pokemon box : Ruby and Sapphire it was a GameCube game and it was pretty much Pokemon bank before the internet existed so here it is on ebay Pokemon box Ruby and Sapphire Nintendo GameCube 2004 box and game manual pre-owned five hundred and ten dollars with 30 active bids on it it ends in three hours Oh what do you gain from it wait did he he said make sure he said a fixture and I was like oh my gosh I told you I have it good I'd buy all of these things look I was an adult I had my own money I could make poor choices like buying pokemon bucks which I did okay so now that we've talked about how Pokemon box is worth $500 if you go on ebay you'll probably see my sub Pokemon boxes for like 50 bucks those are PAL versions so they won't specifically work I believe with they don't work with a lot of things so just keep in my old meaning that the regional what if they call that region lock region locked pasar you're up and Australia I think oh I thought how was Pacific Asia I just sent you my other my other shame Pokemon box list of Pokemon there's so the cool thing about Pokemon box is you can get a skiddy on it and this yes giddy will know heyday and it's the only way ever that skiddy can have payday yeah I mean I'm pretty sure my gamecube still has my Pokemon box in it and make game kids in the other room but I just realized like I was gonna hook that up but I don't think I have a TV that accepts the plugins anymore oh they make adaptors for that yeah they make like oh you can get like a $10 composite two HDMI adapter on Amazon well yes I have to check all that stuff out I have all this I have all these things I have the bonus if somewhere I'm sure I know roughly where it is in my house umm I'd have to look for it but yeah I was like oh I never I also never took anything out of my boxes from Coliseum I never took like they all just are sitting in there somewhere so at some point when I I don't know have nothing to do with my life which is never I will have to go through and start trying to pull all these things onto cartridges that I can move to move them up but yeah you can borrow my box at some point cool could that be that I want to get the I I just want get the special Pokemon off it so specifically I'm poking my box you can get a swablu which doesn't seem too special except I think it learns fall swipe which i think is exclusive to swablu you can get a Zigzagoon by having a hundred Pokemon in the Pokemon box that I know I do have but I think it's still stuck in box you can get the special skiddy I don't know uh what does exude is supposed to be it says tackle growl tailwhip extreme speed I guess it's extreme speed I think it's extreme speed yeah so Greg let's make sure to put that on the list of things to bring them we don't go to st. Louis at the end of the month okay sounds good and then the skiddy can have tackle growl tail whip and payday so that's the only way skiddy can have payday and then there's a Pichu if you have 1500 Pokemon in my Pokemon box which I think that's the max is I think is 1500 for that I think so which is Pichu with Thunder shock charm and surf all of these are in regular pokeballs not cherished balls the thing about my Pokemon Ranch which is cool is you can get a phione in a cherish fall by depositing I think 250 Pokemon and with the OT of Hali and then you can get a mu so for anyone that's like um use a $50 pay wall in in in pokeball plus - the fact that they've given away Mew like six times the United States you get unlimited Mews if you have my Pokemon ranch you just have to deposit 999 Pokemon and then you get a mu with a cherish ball ot Haley so you can get unlimited Mews through my Pokemon ranch you can get unlimited Karachi's through the Colosseum bonus disc you can get unlimited Celebes through suffering 6 hours through pokemon crystal and then resetting it and then doing it again the maximum pokemon in my pokemon ranch is 1500 as well by the way all these old games but this wait where how did we get to this conversation anything how do we get to any conversation Pokemon home McGee rinna mess up oh right that's how I got here are we still on that it's been like an hour okay we are going to take a break we got some more sword and shield news when we get back so we will be right back [Music] happy International Women's Day it's super effective listeners welcome to an extra special edition of Maddie on the move as you know usually I'm out and about for this talking The Strangers about what they think about Pokemon but I wanted to do something different this time in today's segment I'm digitally on the move I took some time to chat with my favorite Pokemon fans my women and non-binary pocus sisters who make me feel so lucky to be part of this community every day so without further ado here's Maddie on the Skype move making calls from her office upstairs okay let's go [Music] okay so who am I talking to right now my name is Cody my favorite thing about Pokemon is collecting everything so I am a wildlife biologist and I really like categorizing and knowing all the different animals and I read them cool I like that cuz you're like a real-life pokemon trainer and catcher that's what I like about you so if you had to pick Cody which Pokemon best identifies you and why so I was think about this earlier and I - my favorite Pokemon is shiny a little and Vulpix that's what I have as my buddy in Pokemon Co but I think the Pokemon that I most identify with is probably tangela what do you like about being a girl Pokemon player what does that mean to you you know go ahead my player it to me I think my favorite thing about it has been that I've always underestimate my talking to right now introduce yourself I'm Carolyn also known as best bot creature can you tell me Carolyn what you love about being a girl pokemon player well I've come on forever since I was a small kid so I I grew up with it have a bunch of friends from Pokemon I have way too much Pokemon stuff in my place there's never too much sometimes when you look at how much money you spend the month better that you can just think about later or Never okay so I feel like this might be the easiest question everyone else I'm excited to hear what they say about what Pokemon identifies them the most who do you think Carolyn well it's not my favorite Pokemon but the pokemons that I relate to is Pancham oh I'm surprised because Pancham is feisty and wants to think that it's intimidating but actually it's just oh my gosh I love that it's really cute too so it's not like I don't love him if you had to give advice to any little girls playing Pokemon right now what types of words of wisdom would you give them I would say there's no like on your team just take whoever you like if you want to t-mobile cute pokémon you should do it oh my name is Rochelle I've known you for at least was it I think I've been in here for like over two years now the first thing I knew about you is you're a champion for basically everybody but especially the polkas sister's Channel you're an inspiration on slack when it comes to female empowerment and sisterhood can you tell me why being a female pokemon fan is so important to you feels like a question I would be asked by my therapist nah I don't know I think I don't know this is exactly what you're asking but I think the angle I would probably take this at is that Lake I feel like it's sort of like core essence Pokemon at least should be a space where like anyone everyone is kind of welcome like I think I've talked about this before I were like ever since the very beginning there's been a lot of like gender parity and like the jobs of the Pokemon world and that's always been super inspiring to me like to be able to have women from the very beginning who I like nurses and police officers and the strongest trainers in the whole region like felt like it should be a very welcoming space to be for women especially I totally agree playing that when I was younger like there was never a thing of like oh you're just a girl like you're not you know part of this that had no factor in it I think you really represent that type of attitude and that's hot in how you act in the Pokemon community and it's really inspiring you're inspiring that you say thank you thank you you're welcome what Pokemon it resonates with you who do you identify with the most I could probably come up with a lot of answers for this if you let me figure it out every which way my gut instinct today would actually probably be to say glice APOD i don't know if you're expecting that no I was not because Goliath odd is like when you fight your fight and you fight real hard but also sometimes you get tired and you gotta tap out and identify with that a lot mm-hmm same 100% and also relies upon mostly just wants to like live in a cave and meditate and be chill I'm glad one more question this is also another on that's right up your alley you get to talk to yourself in the past Rochelle picks up her first Pokemon game ever what words it was some are you giving her oh my gosh I I was not expecting to go to Pokemon therapy for this little Q&A session it's me you know me I love this kind of stuff I should have expected this I'm gonna say I would tell myself not to ever worry about anybody who says your favorite Pokemon are silly or dumb because everybody's gonna have their favorites and everyone's gonna think some other ones are stupid and that doesn't mean that they're right it just means that they like different things than you because I spent a lot of time in my childhood being really upset and feeling really bad because no one likes the Pokemon i light and that made me feel like they didn't like me and that's not true rachelle thank you so much for talking with me tonight this is the best a dangerous 7-eleven alone so is this your second International Women's Day episode the day boy if you had to pick one Pokemon to best identify you who would you pick this is a bag of because bagging is learn how to spy and senses and tiny triangle and jumping off cliffs and I thought that's just hi with my life try to get get you a BB if you had to give advice to any little girls that were playing Pokemon now what would you want to say to them just enjoy it hi my name is Naruto I have a the pronoun I am a non-binary femme what Pokemon really did you resonate with like what pokum I do you feel you really identify with that would have to be the 11th okay I'm always cold and I always need someone to warm me up not just that I kind of am very shy which if you've seen the anime depictions of the available pick she's very shy standoffish she doesn't she's not really friendly but she warms up through that one special person like her trainer Lily and that's kind of me I just take some time to come out of my shell if somebody treats me with kindness and respect and generally shows an interest in me then I'll go up for them slowly surely and you know hi I'm Kelly Kelly who are you it's International Women's Day what does that mean to you as a Pokemon fan I know how much we all just genuinely adore there is no judgement which Pokemon do you feel best represents you who do you identify with as a Pokemon because mystery dungeon has to be addressed these are just bad okay Kelly so my little goofball what advice would you give to all the little girls out there that are playing video games no matter how how much you think you can't beat a level or you can't get there I promise you you can you're right you're a hundred percent right uh Haley so it's International Women's Day most definitely the best day of the year what does being a female Pokemon player mean to you what does it mean to be growing up as a girl playing this game I was he's adorable characters but he was able to love and I could connect with a lot of different people over it and there wasn't that I never personally experienced the idea of like oh well Pokemon is for girls so I'm not gonna play it it was like every time I said I was a Pokemon player the reaction I got from males females and everything in between was oh my god who's your favorite rather than any kind of like oh well obviously you must like that because you're a girl gamer who only plays oh ha and my experience to like the Pokemon communities are just so incredibly positive all the time right that like it's it's kind of a safe space to be honest about what you like and what's fun for you if you could pick any Pokemon that best represents you like who do you identify with the most as a Pokemon I think right now in my life I identify most with Eevee because I have a whole and complete person in my own right but I have so many options of things I can become and things that I'm able to do so it's I'm an Eevee that hasn't agreed to evolution that like oh shoot I forget I forget what's called but in the first season that the anime when it's the brothers trying to convince their brother who have Eevee to to pick which stone he wants to introduce to is Evy and he's like no I like my easy as it is look that's me right now can you introduce yourself please Jordi what does be in a part of the Pokemon community mean to you especially in terms of International Women's Day [Applause] interests there are making new friends and honestly connecting with people that you never thought you in women if you had to pick a Pokemon that best represents you who is it Jordan I like to say mimic you know maybe few tries are to change it is you know that like they make stuff up every day and even when it's disguise gets frosted all night it's knit south and it's back that finesse but I think that's very inspirational is there anything else you want to share any advice to poke them like little kids playing Pokemon right now or anybody yeah just pass play make friends how you make friends if I don't play away and just have fun be yourself Kaitlyn what about being a girl Pokemon player is so important to you what does that mean to you basically just growing up there weren't many people in my school that were girls that were playing for fun so it was just fun of me and always kind of been more of a guy thing until I've become an adult especially gotten into this black community and met all the lovely porky sisters and now I am also getting my 10 year old sister and Pokemon as well and it's just super fun to raise another generation of okie sisters isn't that exciting my my baby sister played Pokemon - and now she's pregnant and she's having a little girl and I'm just so excited to be like okay let's get her into this oh yeah that's definitely my first focus when I have kids of my own is by just forcing them into this katelyn if you had to pick a Pokemon that best represents you who do you identify with so I gave this a lot of thought and I think it's gonna have to be slowpoke because it's always the vacant look on its face it takes a really long time to process anything that's happening and literally forgets what it's doing half the time and that's just matter yeah but slowpoke is also so lovable and cute and perfect too right my name is Lydia flowers and I am Adama flowers little sister can you tell me what being like a girl Pokemon fan means to you well I could come into it you know and even though I was probably I don't know five years old when I first started getting into Pokemon you know I could still be you know as strong as top you know as I wanted to be started off like with the playing cards and then moved on to the console games so even those tiny tiny little five six seven year old girl you know getting to have these huge monster pokemons you can make as strong as you want definitely very empowering and just some of my favorite memories are like up at the cabin me and you like laying in bed playing like pokemon diamond or pearl and like we named all of her pokémon after like vh1 reality TV show characters yeah I mean so much of it I mean obviously started apples like the card game but they're moving at a console adjust she'll like community based you click it to play with your sisters or you know as I got older to play with my friends from school boyfriends and all that stuff just fun fun way to connect with everybody do you hope baby Charlotte will play pokemon oh yeah I'll show B it she'll be into it hopefully I'll be talking should we buy a hair pokemon cards did I grow up with obviously it's something that's sticking around and see future generations getting into it just as much as this as much as needed okay so while you may need no introduction can you please tell me who I'm talking to right now this is Irene and I'm Irene I don't know how else to hi okay Irene it's International Women's Day maybe the best holiday can you tell me a little bit why being a girl Pokemon fan is so important to you so I've been thinking about this for the last few days I guess and I find that being a woman Pokemon fan is important one just because with gaming and women and stuff like that there's the whole discourse and drama and complexity of being a female gamer by default I think about that generally so it's kind of just like being a fan and trying not to make myself any certain way just trying to fit a mold I guess as a particular fan because I don't really enjoy that it's kind of making sure that I am doing what I enjoy rather than oh I am this I'm a woman and I am a fan and so I need to act this particular way does that make sense that makes so much sense and it's kind of in line with it's really neat to hear everyone's kind of said the same thing or just like if you like what you like then screw it when you're you know there's no certain way to be the fan and like with Pokemon there's so many different parts of the game that if you like collecting you can be a collector if you like the cute ones you can like the cute ones if you like being tough and battling you can be into that - it's not like you said you don't have to fit a certain mold exactly and I compared to a lot of other games I feel like those can be a lot more linear and a lot more constricting and what I like about Pokemon exactly is that I can play and do a bunch of stuff and then I can go away and then I can come back and there's more stuff - do I know that sometimes if you finished playing a game it's just like you're walking around trying to find stuff to do and I I don't think that's really the case ever with Pokemon so I appreciate that a whole lot if you had to fake a Pokemon that wasn't quite your favorite but it represented you who do you think the Eirene Pokemon is I I can't pick and I and I feel like that is the best answer for me because actually making a selection in deciding is probably OC which is out of character for me so there are hundreds of hundreds of Pokemon almost a thousand and I still can't pick so I can't pick I think that's valid and I think that's kind of interesting too with Pokemon like I feel like you can make a polka team that would best represent you you know elementally maybe six different ones yes and that's another good thing about Pokemon is that you don't have to just pick one type exactly I'm still like I'm gonna try to say my like what am i dead Oh like oh that's such a good answer right like you kind of adapt to every situation that is phenomenal I tried it a I told mark my husband that he was like no you don't copy people make no I don't mean it like that I just mean that you're adaptable you change to fit the situation exactly and it's also kind of like a fake it till you make it type of thing or it's like sometimes I don't know what I'm doing that I just make it up it's gaming code-switching perfect all right I mean do you have any other words of wisdom or messages to pass on for International Women's Day slay continue continue to be your best self and if you don't know what that is continue to try and figure out what that is thank you for listening to this extra special edition I'm Addie on the move this was by far my favorite episode to record I hope that you found some inspiration I listen to these smart amazing funny strong silly warm women then what's common theme I heard talking everybody was that Pokemon such an amazing community because everyone's welcome it gets ounds cheesy but the story that Pokemon tells is that you can be literally anybody and it doesn't matter who you are right exactly at that moment you have every right to earn that champion title as much as anyone else does and since I asked everyone else which Pokemon represents them I suppose I should answer to it was kind of hard Kelly suggested maybe I was my while because I act sweet when I got a big mouth I thought maybe I was dead oh because I like to adapt to new situations mmm but I think I'll pick flabébé my maiden last name is flower so I'm definitely found of a floral theme and I'm a person who loves using herbs and flowers for strengths and taking advantage of their hidden healing properties I thought it was fitting plus it's just really cute and one of the reasons why I love Pokemon it's really cute all right that's it from me I hope everyone has an amazing International Women's Day and we'll see you next time bye [Music] this is off pokemon.com battle with mower Giganta max pokemon in ranked battles in the March season compete now with in the ranked battles at March season Pokemon soar Pokemon shield it is the fourth season began in March and it will run through all of March that you are allowed to use Giganta max Pokemon such as Charizard Butterfree Pikachu Meowth kingler Lapras Eevee Snorlax core of a night or beetle dreadnought colossal flap 'l appleton sand akanda talks tricity centas scorch have to read grim snarl and al creme II may all be used I did not say your favorite Giganta max Pokemon it cannot be used I mean that's probably a shorter list at this point uh what kappa Raja I getting guard Machamp probably some other guys I'm not remembering I don't know why I have such a hard time with the whole Giganta max thing it's like I wish they made it easier to tell just when you're looking in your boxes of like which one's the Giganta max yeah that's why I use the that's why I mark them with the red circle oh we're not against hot garbage marketing system you know you will be matched up to players similar to your rank when the season concludes you learn battle points ability capsules bottle caps etc have fun battling we've talked about this before but I feel like I get this question a lot on Twitter or twitch or whatnot of like how do you have somebody battle points if you make it to master rank in a season and a season is you know a month so beginning of the month to the end of the month if you make the master rank in singles or doubles you will get rewarded with 600 battle points and if you do it in both you get 1200 battle points for you know 600 plus 600 1200 and this has been available since the start of the game so if you're you know if you're trying to get in competitive or you're you're going through the tower you are rewarded I think the reward is you're awesome I think 600 battle points for you know just making it to master rank is a pretty great reward it is possible to to have more losses than wins and still make it in - master rank it's possible that way wait so there's no more special berries the the special berries in the game code are given to you through the battle tower not through ranked battles ah ok ok I did make my own team if you so you can't make it to master rank with a rental team you don't have to spend hours or days you know trying to build your own team and Eevee train it and get the right abilities and stuff you can rent a team and I did that for the first three seasons I rented a team I have built my own team now which I am going through the March season with I will put that team in the shownotes it's uh the the whole gimmick of the team is that you have a muds veil which has the ability oblivious I think is what I call it's called so it cannot be confused you cannot have it stats lowered from intimidate and then you use grim snarl with prankster and you use swagger on the muds Dale to increase its attack plus 2 or plus 4 or plus 6 so many times you swagger and then you dynamaxx the muds Dale and then it just wrecks house and group snarl can also set up light screen and reflect as we learn from those awful Mewtwo raids yes yes lights are going to reflect yes so if you don't want to bail a team and you want to try out my team to try to climb master rank doubles that team will be in the show notes for you to check out if you have any questions you know about the other Pokemon feel free to ask me too but that's is underway speaking of competitions this is off polygons calm a Pokemon sword and shield now have a great ball guy what yeah great ball guy so there will be the ball guy t-shirt I did is cute you did you sign up a forget to battle correct got it you can register for the 2020 international challenge from 4 April from March 26 - April 9th the reward is a ball guide t but he is a great ball instead of a pokeball the on line a double battle competition will be between April 10th to the 12th and you can earn points for the qualifying World Championship this you cannot use a rental team you have to use your own team no rental teams allowed but sign ups will be end of March will remind you when that happens competition is April 10th through 12th so you've got plenty of time you only have to do one battle to earn this shirt you do have to sign up before the battle start and you do have to do one battle win or lose in order to earn the shirts but if you do place high enough you will get actual championship points towards an invite to the world that championship which as of this podcast has not been cancelled or delayed correct well it's not until the fall oh yeah that time they have time yes this is off Pokemon calm though update on the 2020 pokemon european international championships the safety and well-being of our community both competitors and organisers is our top priority while will prefer never to see an event get postponed or canceled out of an abundance of caution and by the current recommendations set forth by the public health officials we have canceled the 2020 European international Championships we want to thank the play pokemon community for their continued interest in the competitive events and appreciates everyone support and understanding during these unique circumstances you see pokemon calm / us / play pokemon or follow at play pokemon on twitter for more updates on play pokemon events if you have additional questions you can contact pokemon customer service what play pokemon events are cancelled due to how did they say this kovin 19 Khurana virus Corona of what is it CoV I D so it's corona virus I can't remember what the D is for 2019 for the events directly organized by the Pokemon company international we will examine each event by a case-by-case basis information by the latest updates issued by the appropriate government and the World Health Organization recommendations currently there are no plans to propose pone or cancel any of the 2020 Pokemon North America international championships or the 2020 World Championships although there was like a rumor saying that the world championships was going to be canceled like somebody tweeted about this this is literally a Pokemon comm currently there are no plans to postpone or cancel both the International North American Championships or the 2020 World Championships so I'm not sure where that rumor got started however we are closely monitoring the situation and keep we will keep the community updated in real-time on our website and on play Pokemon Twitter should circumstances change we strongly advise attendees volunteers and organizers to follow guidelines and protocols issued by the World Health Organization regarding health and wellness attending mass gatherings next question is should I be concerned about kovat 19 at play Pokemon events while we have no reports directly linking any cases of the virus with our events the safety and well-being of our community both competitors organisers is our top priority we strongly advise all attendees volunteers okay so just repeating what they said earlier if you want more information pokemon comm or support pokemon calm for that so the question is what we keep asking ourselves to is Niantic going to cancel the upcoming Safari Zone in two and a half weeks here and when is Pennsylvania Safari Zone in May the first week of May I think so that's a little farther away the bigger one is the bigger concern is literally the one in two weeks yeah absolutely and even even if it's not canceled I don't know that I want to go you'll be fine I do think the okay so the two things that kind of correspond with this is from what I've been reading and since I work for a large international organization we have to kind of be responsive to this ourselves that the peak season like we're there probably will be the largest distribution of this particular virus or viral infections is going to be late March early April which is when the st. Louis event is scheduled to happen and what I've also heard from a medical type I want to say a physician but not a biologist so this is maybe a little less than accurate but that these type of viruses don't survive well in warmer temperatures so in May when it starts to get warmer that we'll have fewer infections just because this virus doesn't do well in weight managers there's still a lot they don't know right sure like this is this is very very new it's got a long incubation time so it's been very hard to track so it's hard to say exactly what's going to happen but like as another large international company I'm banned from traveling for company reasons they have stopped and cancelled all traveling and a number of teams are being forced to work from home it's a big deal and I would really like something from Niantic soon yes agree yeah it's funny because I talk to so many people every day through through twitch chat and I feel like most one way not to catch if I I'm very safe through twitch chat it's funny how Milwaukee has feels like the opposite of the rest of the world in this and I I I'm not downplaying you know other cities or other states but I have gone out recently I did Darkrai this weekend went to a couple grocery stores you we still have plenty of hand sanitizer no one's stocking up on water there's plenty of like everything and it just seems like my wife and I were at the mall yesterday and it was just packed and the entire time I was thinking like okay as soon as I get back to my car I'm gonna douse myself in hand sanitizer as soon as I Drive home I'm gonna wash my hands I'm gonna try not to touch anything because I just went there to do a regigigas raid and then leave but like it just from talking to people who work at Walgreens in other country or in other states or targets or Walmart's and other cities it just sounds like they're out of everything and probably because there's I think there hasn't been a case in Milwaukee at all yet but it just seems like Milwaukee is like this other part of the world country where there's like not a care in the world here around me I haven't noticed any runs on anything Oh see we live in the city my family who lives up the suburbs are sending pictures of all the panicky people in their suburban suburban world who part of the reason why you're out in the suburbs because you don't see people but their arrogance their targets are cleared out and like we just went shopping today and all of our stuff is fine it's like all of these panicky people out the suburbs are like oh I might run into somebody I better buy fifty thousand things of toilet paper it's like get real we've had one confirmed case in Minnesota and that person was very smart and self-quarantine themselves and they were in st. Paul so really I'm the only one who's that race paper you get up a day oh no you couldn't even get that to work I gotta have a working bird a will and also I want I never got to use it I want to what is it you would call out when you have to say Amalfi's er give give name to malfeasance list lifetime fitness I leave my house once a day I literally spend my entire day bolon leave my house go to the gym and come back home how did I get the flu last week you are membership we played magic like two weeks ago Oh true don't blame your gym although you can blame lifetime because they're kind of garbage you people but yeah Irene Irene and I are trying to plan a trip in in mid-may so mmm get those plane tickets while they're cheap before yeah we've booked some stuff it's all it's all technically refund refundable and I don't think I would ever book an international flight without some kind of insurance slash you know these tickets I would never book an international non-refundable flight let me reword it that way so I don't think we're specifically worried about getting sick we're both you know we we're both young and very healthy and and whatnot I think we're more worried about going to a place and everything just being closed I think that's that the worry is like we travel a thousand miles and you're finally there and the theme park or something is closed for you know a month or a week or a weekend or that's that's what we're really worried about and you know if we have to delay or cancel our trip that's fine it's just totally understand so the company that makes Vanguard basically in Japan have told people to stop having shop tournaments for the trading card game and they have set up a discord where people can go on the discord and set up matches where they do like which is what I do for playing Vanguard Italy like you take a webcam and just point it at your play mat and then you do matches that way and they're literally giving promos and everything and they're giving face masks to all the card shops so that people don't go to the card shops to play yeah I think it's I mean I I think it's smart to just have people work at home for the next month or delay school or whatnot it's I mean I've been saying work at home since September so I don't know I guess the only thing we can do is monitor it but we're not a we're not a health podcast act now wash your hands be safe get up a day this is off original stitch Johto fabrics coming to the dress shirts they've been announced you can see a couple of them on the original stitch website they have a tab for canto they have a tab for Johto they have like a Slowking a Quagsire skip loom togepi starters girafarig delibird smeargle they have some of the designs you can see early it looks like they they still have every Kanto design I know some of them were sold out for a while but it looks like they're all back in stock I really want to get one of these shirts but man don't waste your money you'll never wear it hundred bucks for a dress shirt is that ridiculous it's oh the oddest one is actually sold out oddly enough I can always get it tailored like I can always get it fixed by ideally you want to order it right the first the thing is every dresser fits slightly differently depending on brand and some of them have French cuffs which you're scared of yeah I don't like the French mm-hmm I mean those regular cuffs so that's that's an update they're an original stitch I mean I don't care there's no Dunsparce pattern yet so Joe toes coming I know but it's not there yet so snooze wake me up when it's when it's Hoenn Pokemon Center calm stocked some more stuff here after Pokemon Day oddly enough but there is a now crème è ÿ ampere and Doral Adan or maybe it's Dora it's either dura luden order ella done I want to say it's dura because it's supposed to be literally done durable yeah there are bowls what I think those three plushies are now available they also added the Galler journey begins figure which I think I might actually order which is a cute little scaler starter statue and then a dreg you pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team DX oh boy ye I'm not getting it I was getting those this is gonna be my question to you guys did either of you pick up mystery dungeon I didn't I played it the first time and I'm not I liked the series but I'm not like the last couple have been not fun for me to play like I don't remember which is the last one that just came out but I didn't even finish it and I was like super mystery dungeon yeah or whatever it was and I was thinking about him like I didn't even finish the last one do I really want to pay $60 to play a remake of the game that I'm not that into right now since I'm still on the fence about Animal Crossing which comes out sooner like it's just it didn't it didn't enticed me enough to buy it yeah and I played the demo and I enjoy the demo it was cute and everything I think if I had people around me who we're playing it where you know I could talk about it and kind of play it that way I'd be more interested but kind of just doing it completely solo is it's not enough for me to go back to that particular story and everything yeah I am I didn't play it the first time I came out I played I played about three hours of explorers of the sky I played about three hours of gates to infinity and neither really captured me or what not all right Nintendo full disclosure Nintendo did send me a copy of Pokemon mystery dungeon so I'll send that right over here then I went yeah I'll give it a chance probably this week on Twitch I'll probably stream a little bit of it and give it a chance I'm actually curious what Pokemon that will sign me that's the thing I'm most excited about I mean I told you how much fun they are fun to play the first time we'll have coverage of it soon I just have to I just have to carve out some time to to play it but I have it so alright last bit of news here is the Pokemon go battle league season 1 will start between March 13th through April 30th right now you can either participate in great ultra or master but season 1 will kick off March 13th you will be matched against players similar to your level you will get five matches each day to keep battling you need to walk three kilometres to unlock the other five matches you can spend coins if you don't want to walk yadda yadda yadda and then there is a new event in a returning event in Pokemon masters full disclosure I am partnered with DNA Greg and will are not but now that legendary event lurking shadow is back yep they did a thing UI I never played it the first time Greg so there's if there's major differences here I would love to know but for those there's not major differences but they counted all the things that I had done before except for two of them as already complete so when I logged in I got the reward there learning I was very happy I'm like I don't want to go through this whole thing again hey when I went in there he was all checked off and I'm like well it's about time they made friends with you if you don't know what this is they brought back Giovanni in u2 into Pokemon masters so if you have if you missed it the first time you now have a chance to get it this is the first time they've repeated a major event I believe that will run until March 15th red and Charizard Eliza and Rotom run till the 16th you log in between now and the 16th you do get your 3,000 bonus gems for logging in during be what do they call it the Pokemon day gem celebration can I say I hate okay the first one I like where I get the one thing but the second one where it's like if you miss a day you go all the way back to one I hate that oh the like seven day login or whatever yeah uh well I guess don't miss a day okay I'm not I forget things so that's back that's it that's uh that's that's all the news this week a little bit light but we'll do you have our Pokemon of the week wait we don't have a question of the week well all questions next week Oh dag well okay dang sprung it on me okay and Pokemon of the week but last week's Pokemon was a poem called sunkern the goth corn prince and if that can give you the answer right there I so the clues from the poem were that sunkern used to have the lowest combined stat total of all Pokemon but it doesn't any longer the Pokemon that does have the lowest combined stat total has an ability that cannot be removed by mommy but can be removed by wandering spirit and there's a clue in the poem where it says ground has taken a lesson from the ocean and that ability goes into effect as long as your Pokemon is over level 20 and over 25% HP and that's pretty much all the clues you need now come on who's the Pokemon it's sunkern was not sunkern it's wishy-washy it's wishy-washy you are 100% correct wishy-washy now has the lowest combined set to base that total of all Pokemon there's actually somebody else also below so wishy-washy and sunkern so they're slipping them in all over the place but yes wishy-washys ability is called schooling schooling and it's it's gold that's dramatically changed when it's in school form or solo form goes from solo form is based at total 175 school form base stat total 620 and it can only activate that ability if it's over level 20 and over 25% HP so once it drops below 25% HP then it on the schools if it drops below 25% but then like gets health back does it Reese cool oh I do but I don't know I don't know that's just on your stream yeah I guess because I know a streamer I normally see this computer players use wishy-washy I never really seen like he wishy-washy holding like a citrus berry or something how interesting somebody's got to try it somebody already has somebody knows no I just the you know the trivia of you know 175 to 620 Bay stat total stuff nothing not a lot of trivia about John seven Jen a Pokemon really dagnabbit I like about the this this week's is gonna have a whole lot of trivia maybe I'd never check that ahead of time right you guys ready I'm ready yeah you may not have realized this but until you complete the full story of pokemon sword and shield there is no night your entire adventure exists solely in the daylight hours no matter what time of day it actually is while you are playing why did they do this they did this because they wanted to keep you from obtaining one of the best Pokemon ever designed it isn't any of these Pokemon aurorus Chimecho a lowly marowak gliscor obstacle a little and Radek eight like in Rock Weavile or Frost moth why are there so many dark types that evolve only at night with high friendship why did Game Freak keep us from obtaining this Pokemon until the game was over I suppose you could find one at the lake of outrage you can't get there though until later in the game and there has to be a sandstorm going on at the time this week's Pokemon shares its ability with its psychic cousin although it is mostly super effective against that dude all right there you go that's enough clues for always sure frost mop no it's not frost moth Oh fry spot is my favorite I thought mom was your favorite ex Nam to their omelet oh you know what we we didn't really take this in consideration or maybe we did it I cut it I cut a lot of stuff from last week's episode because it was so long yeah you making a sound bed youth your edits no no no no no no no no no no no no way Wow release the director's cut for the Pokemon of the year thing we didn't really talk about is the amount of Pokemon that were split so like for example in in Kanto there were there are a hundred and fifty-one Pokemon to vote on but in but in Kalos there's only like 78 Pokemon to vote on so does that give greninja just an unfair advantage because there's less what do they call that in in politics where like a third party you like splits the vote but no that's a spoiler but like there's a bunch of useless Pokemon that we're taking away votes from Charizard but now but but it's it's I think it was like the overall number of votes right right you could vote every day so each section like you could go in each session you didn't have to vote in each section that's true so if it was mandatory I would say yes it was mandatory to vote in each section but it wasn't because they were fewer to pick from there doesn't mean like if you look at the numbers they put out underneath how many people voted for those clearly a lot of people went in there and clicked on that one where like they didn't for all of you Nova because you Nova only starts at 50,000 votes yeah you know and Genova has 156 writing on them so did it play a factor maybe like there's a lot of choices to go in that area so people would have more to choose from but if they didn't like any in that section they wouldn't vote for that section because it wasn't like you had to complete each one you could have just gotten into Kanto and clicked on Charizard and done none of the others and that would have counted yeah that's true so I don't I mean I don't think it played a big enough factor to say that you know it's Virginia came out on top because it split the vote like that because there were so few in that generation like that's I don't think that's a factor that people looked at I think it was much more of a I'm sure there was some people that thought they had to vote for every one thing and they got to Jem six and they were like I don't know grinning joke cuz I don't know who else I like in this Jen maybe I that's sort of a hard thing to quantify it writing I think it's hard to say yeah absolutely but if you look at the raw votes they just they just came out with way more votes pure numbers wise like there was a lot more we'll be back next week Hey but back for the big one next week with a big 400 hopefully enjoyed the episode if you haven't done so already and you want to keep up to date at pkmn cast on twitter
