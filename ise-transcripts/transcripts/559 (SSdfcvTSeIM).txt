whole new monitor for an outrageous (1:09 - 1:11)
price (1:11 - 1:15)
why not I'm already down on the tubes uh (1:11 - 1:17)
correct but I have a new monitor I have (1:15 - 1:19)
a new setup I'm trying to figure out my (1:17 - 1:21)
lighting you may be able to see my (1:19 - 1:22)
lightsaber that I built in the (1:21 - 1:24)
background now (1:22 - 1:28)
got that at Disney built my own keyboard (1:24 - 1:29)
I have my keyboard set which has to go (1:28 - 1:31)
into another a lot of things have to (1:29 - 1:33)
happen once it warms up there's a hole (1:31 - 1:35)
everything can be different the minute (1:33 - 1:37)
there's any chance I can have a door (1:35 - 1:38)
open (1:37 - 1:39)
got it (1:38 - 1:42)
uh okay well we got a show for you guys (1:39 - 1:43)
today uh we're gonna talk about some (1:42 - 1:47)
Pokemon go uh drama alert (1:43 - 1:49)
no we're gonna talk about the remote (1:47 - 1:51)
right pass changes uh there's some (1:49 - 1:53)
changes in the TCG we're going to talk (1:51 - 1:56)
about those are good changes I think the (1:53 - 1:59)
TCG changes not the go changes yeah yeah (1:56 - 2:01)
yeah let's be clear (1:59 - 2:03)
uh and then there are some scarlet and (2:01 - 2:05)
violet stuff lechonk new online (2:03 - 2:08)
competition Samurai all that stuff we'll (2:05 - 2:10)
talk about after the Break (2:08 - 2:13)
um but let's start with Pokemon go uh we (2:10 - 2:14)
went what almost three weeks without (2:13 - 2:17)
really needing to talk about Pokemon go (2:14 - 2:21)
because the uh season of boringness I (2:17 - 2:23)
don't know the season of zeros is (2:21 - 2:26)
happening this uh this new season is (2:23 - 2:27)
it's fine (2:26 - 2:31)
um it's always just it's fine it's there (2:27 - 2:33)
right (2:31 - 2:33)
like I can't I can't get over the the (2:34 - 2:39)
Twilight Sparkle event or whatever that (2:37 - 2:41)
event was so good (2:39 - 2:44)
yeah yeah the one before this one (2:41 - 2:47)
dragons and fairies yeah I don't I still (2:44 - 2:48)
don't really know (2:47 - 2:51)
what this season's about (2:48 - 2:53)
and that's on me probably because I (2:51 - 2:57)
think about superhero theme hey I guess (2:53 - 2:59)
but but (2:57 - 3:01)
there's nothing (2:59 - 3:04)
about I think it's called Rising Heroes (3:01 - 3:06)
yeah it is (3:04 - 3:08)
and so there was a team go rocket event (3:06 - 3:10)
so you battled all the team go rocket (3:08 - 3:14)
leaders and they released Hawlucha in (3:10 - 3:16)
Mexico so there's that (3:14 - 3:19)
and then uh Reggie aliki comes out on on (3:16 - 3:22)
Easter my favorite Reggie aliki has (3:19 - 3:25)
risen again and uh we're bombi's coming (3:22 - 3:27)
which is the only thing that I care (3:25 - 3:30)
about right now he's a superhero (3:27 - 3:32)
and people don't believe (3:30 - 3:34)
they try to fight me on it (3:32 - 3:37)
it's rude they uh (3:34 - 3:40)
uh to be you know to give Niantic the (3:37 - 3:43)
the little bit of credit that they they (3:40 - 3:44)
desperately need (3:43 - 3:45)
um their Community days this year has (3:44 - 3:47)
been really good like their Community (3:45 - 3:49)
days have been good picks uh it feels (3:47 - 3:52)
like everyone's excited about those (3:49 - 3:54)
um I think their April Fool's event was (3:52 - 3:57)
like cute uh what was the April Fool's (3:54 - 3:59)
event it was just like Pidgey spawning (3:57 - 3:59)
everywhere (3:59 - 4:02)
[Music] (3:59 - 4:04)
I got a message on my phone that said (4:02 - 4:06)
there's super small pidgeys around and I (4:04 - 4:09)
literally thought why do I care (4:06 - 4:13)
April fools yeah again (4:09 - 4:15)
I liked that I could complete it in less (4:13 - 4:17)
than 15 minutes (4:15 - 4:20)
yeah it was it was just like a cute like (4:17 - 4:22)
one-off um did you do did you do the (4:20 - 4:25)
Pokemon Masters April Fool's event I did (4:22 - 4:27)
not I didn't I didn't know they had one (4:25 - 4:30)
it was (4:27 - 4:30)
you had to it was Clefairy versus Togepi (4:31 - 4:40)
but I'm interested they could only use (4:36 - 4:42)
metronome (4:40 - 4:42)
and so the event was can you get this (4:45 - 4:51)
move to go off and if you do you get (4:49 - 4:55)
gems for it she had to do 10 to get the (4:51 - 4:57)
10 of the 17 moves to go off which you (4:55 - 4:59)
know really you have three Chugga beasts (4:57 - 5:00)
and you just hit metronome and you hope (4:59 - 5:02)
you hit it it was not hard to do but I (5:00 - 5:04)
was like this is kind of funny I mean I (5:02 - 5:06)
appreciate it and best of all they added (5:04 - 5:09)
Stephen to the smooching Lodge so now (5:06 - 5:11)
you can smooch up (5:09 - 5:13)
Steven Stone the real news we've been (5:11 - 5:15)
waiting for is the real that's racing (5:13 - 5:16)
now we're just waiting for Wallace to (5:15 - 5:18)
get in there I'm just gonna say did they (5:16 - 5:20)
add Wallace which I'm pretty sure is (5:18 - 5:23)
causing drama in their relationship as (5:20 - 5:25)
we speak I sure sure look his Blue's in (5:23 - 5:27)
there and red isn't so that's a whole (5:25 - 5:30)
thing to navigate (5:27 - 5:34)
you know Masters is might be one of the (5:30 - 5:36)
best Pokemon games that exists currently (5:34 - 5:38)
that's really good we just got bald guy (5:36 - 5:41)
so you can get ball guy as a pair like (5:38 - 5:43)
what more do you need (5:41 - 5:45)
all right so this is off of Pokemon (5:43 - 5:48)
golive.com updates to Pokemon Go's (5:45 - 5:51)
remote raid passes trainers we wanted to (5:48 - 5:52)
give you a heads up change about what's (5:51 - 5:54)
coming to Pokemon Go's remote raid (5:52 - 5:56)
passes these changes are designed to (5:54 - 6:00)
rebalance the game and to ensure it's (5:56 - 6:02)
enjoyed by trainers years to come this (6:00 - 6:05)
effect will go in this the changes will (6:02 - 6:07)
go into effect on April 6th (6:05 - 6:09)
we're we are (6:07 - 6:12)
first is price mint adjusts adjustments (6:09 - 6:14)
the price of a single remote raid pass (6:12 - 6:17)
will increase from 100 coins to 195 (6:14 - 6:19)
coins (6:17 - 6:22)
the price of the remote Raid 3 pack will (6:19 - 6:27)
increase from 300 coins to 525 coins (6:22 - 6:29)
I don't what's what's the math on that (6:27 - 6:31)
like how much are you saving (6:29 - 6:33)
uh (6:31 - 6:34)
likes (6:33 - 6:38)
65 cents I think not a lot (6:34 - 6:40)
a a pre that back in the day that could (6:38 - 6:44)
get you Arcana Coca-Cola a premium raid (6:40 - 6:47)
pass three pack will be added to the (6:44 - 6:50)
shop for a price of 250 coins so that's (6:47 - 6:52)
new that's brand new we've never had a (6:50 - 6:53)
uh (6:52 - 6:55)
uh premium this is the green ones the (6:53 - 6:58)
ones you that that's new (6:55 - 6:59)
um (6:58 - 7:01)
there is now remote raid pass (6:59 - 7:04)
limitations trainers will be able to (7:01 - 7:07)
participate in a maximum of five remote (7:04 - 7:10)
raids per day this maximum may change (7:07 - 7:13)
and increase for special of I'm (7:10 - 7:14)
surprised I didn't say increasing or (7:13 - 7:17)
decrease uh this make changes for (7:14 - 7:19)
special events (7:17 - 7:22)
uh then they have a section for remote (7:19 - 7:25)
rate passes is a remote raid passes will (7:22 - 7:28)
be included in the pool of potential (7:25 - 7:30)
rewards for research breakthroughs (7:28 - 7:33)
remote raid passes earned via research (7:30 - 7:35)
breakthroughs are still subject to the (7:33 - 7:37)
inventory limit of having three per (7:35 - 7:40)
trainer if a trainer earns a remote (7:37 - 7:42)
right pass from research breakthrough (7:40 - 7:46)
while at three remote raid pass limit it (7:42 - 7:48)
will then change into a premium raid (7:46 - 7:50)
pass (7:48 - 7:52)
uh technically you can hold up to five (7:50 - 7:54)
because if you hold if you're holding (7:52 - 7:56)
two remote raid passes and you purchase (7:54 - 7:58)
the three pack that'll give you five but (7:56 - 7:59)
if you're holding three and then you go (7:58 - 8:00)
your research breakthrough and that (7:59 - 8:04)
gives you one it turns into a (8:00 - 8:04)
at the at the end of the day Pokemon go (8:04 - 8:09)
is actually an inventory management game (8:07 - 8:10)
and (8:09 - 8:13)
they added hard mode for you I know (8:10 - 8:14)
people were asking for the increased (8:13 - 8:17)
difficulty they wanted Pokemon go be a (8:14 - 8:20)
little bit harder they they've increased (8:17 - 8:22)
their difficulty of inventory management (8:20 - 8:26)
and then they say candy XL trainers who (8:22 - 8:29)
participate in five star raids in person (8:26 - 8:33)
will earn more candy XL than before (8:29 - 8:36)
is a POS is the one positive change I'm (8:33 - 8:37)
here for (8:36 - 8:40)
okay let's be fair the remote the the (8:37 - 8:42)
premium raid bundles at a 50 Cent (8:40 - 8:44)
discount is a good change I can't (8:42 - 8:46)
remember the last time I bought those no (8:44 - 8:49)
I've had like a stock of 40 of them I'm (8:46 - 8:52)
still sitting on so many that I'm like I (8:49 - 8:55)
forgot they were a thing I have like 65. (8:52 - 8:58)
yeah like we're not gonna say that (8:55 - 9:01)
that's like a value in like six months (8:58 - 9:03)
we'll be like ah we finally got that to (9:01 - 9:05)
zero now we're saving 50. so I'm saving (9:03 - 9:07)
that 50 cents for a thing I don't want (9:05 - 9:11)
to do here's the thing I can't decide (9:07 - 9:15)
which is better to do to people (9:11 - 9:17)
slowly poison them so they don't know (9:15 - 9:19)
they're getting poisoned or dump all the (9:17 - 9:22)
poison at once and hope that they the (9:19 - 9:24)
people who are mad just die away because (9:22 - 9:25)
that's really they kind of went with a (9:24 - 9:27)
dump all the poison the water supply and (9:25 - 9:30)
hope only the hardiest survive with this (9:27 - 9:32)
one because they could have done the (9:30 - 9:34)
slow drip that most corporations do is (9:32 - 9:36)
say hey we're going to limit remote raid (9:34 - 9:38)
passes to Five a day I think this is (9:36 - 9:42)
better I think just do I I think they (9:38 - 9:45)
would have got complaints regardless the (9:42 - 9:47)
question is is (9:45 - 9:49)
generally when you drip it in you you (9:47 - 9:51)
very much lessen the impact and it can (9:49 - 9:54)
go under the radar this one was like (9:51 - 9:56)
nobody is not going to notice this this (9:54 - 9:59)
one is going to be hey (9:56 - 10:01)
I laced everything you're eating with (9:59 - 10:04)
arsenic so good luck I hope you're (10:01 - 10:07)
immune uh well that's this saves us from (10:04 - 10:10)
talking about this for two episodes (10:07 - 10:10)
all together for us it's a net one no (10:12 - 10:18)
they they said they had no plans of (10:16 - 10:19)
removing remote okay here's a here's (10:18 - 10:21)
here's some things (10:19 - 10:24)
uh full disclosure I'm part of the (10:21 - 10:26)
Niantic program until they eventually (10:24 - 10:28)
kick me out uh who knows when that day (10:26 - 10:29)
will come (10:28 - 10:30)
um (10:29 - 10:32)
we have talked we had tons of meetings (10:30 - 10:35)
with Niantic about remote raid passes (10:32 - 10:38)
changes if you watch Zoe two dots video (10:35 - 10:40)
or trainer tips or whoever else whatever (10:38 - 10:43)
other Pokemon go content creator there's (10:40 - 10:44)
not a lot I can say that hasn't already (10:43 - 10:48)
been said the gist of it is Niantic ask (10:44 - 10:49)
for our feedback (10:48 - 10:52)
we gave them things that we thought (10:49 - 10:54)
would work we gave them changes that (10:52 - 10:56)
would not be as upsetting we gave them (10:54 - 10:58)
things that we gave them everything (10:56 - 11:01)
under the sun they took none of that (10:58 - 11:02)
feedback (11:01 - 11:06)
which is like (11:02 - 11:08)
a little bit I don't I don't know if the (11:06 - 11:10)
words respectable a little bit like oh (11:08 - 11:12)
what man you really stuck to your ground (11:10 - 11:14)
about wanting to get people outside and (11:12 - 11:16)
playing like that has been the the thing (11:14 - 11:18)
you have been (11:16 - 11:21)
you really want people to not be at home (11:18 - 11:23)
like I I guess I respect that you are (11:21 - 11:25)
you would rather have that happen than (11:23 - 11:29)
to take free money but whatever right (11:25 - 11:31)
like that that's you know take that for (11:29 - 11:33)
what it's worth (11:31 - 11:35)
um (11:33 - 11:37)
so yeah we gave them the feedback they (11:35 - 11:40)
didn't again what for whatever reason (11:37 - 11:42)
they they did this (11:40 - 11:45)
um I was actually shocked at the five (11:42 - 11:47)
remote raid passes because the leaker (11:45 - 11:49)
originally said six and it felt like (11:47 - 11:51)
with my meet with our meetings with (11:49 - 11:52)
Niantic it was going to be a little bit (11:51 - 11:54)
more (11:52 - 11:57)
um but then it's a big five (11:54 - 11:59)
I don't know how they got to that number (11:57 - 12:02)
uh they don't disclose like that kind of (11:59 - 12:05)
like if you want to occasionally goes up (12:02 - 12:07)
it will occasionally go up to six oh (12:05 - 12:11)
yeah yeah good call good call (12:07 - 12:11)
um (12:11 - 12:15)
I do think (12:12 - 12:18)
that these changes are not great (12:15 - 12:20)
um to be fair they did say that remote (12:18 - 12:22)
raid pass was discounted and you know it (12:20 - 12:24)
eventually would never be a hundred (12:22 - 12:27)
coins I think 195 is a weird number why (12:24 - 12:30)
is it just not 200 at that point I I (12:27 - 12:31)
thought it was going to come in at maybe (12:30 - 12:35)
like 160 uh or like 170. (12:31 - 12:41)
uh 1959 trick yeah yeah but like (12:35 - 12:41)
it does for some people and at some (12:46 - 12:52)
numbers I think yeah I feel like it (12:49 - 12:54)
works for when like you're looking at (12:52 - 12:56)
like a two thousand dollar purchase and (12:54 - 12:58)
they're like ah it's just shy of 2000. (12:56 - 13:00)
if you're in America you know that (12:58 - 13:01)
that's not the price because there's (13:00 - 13:03)
going to be tax so you already know like (13:01 - 13:06)
this is not the real price I don't know (13:03 - 13:08)
what the real price is because they're (13:06 - 13:10)
lying to me the only thing that I could (13:08 - 13:12)
ever look at and it makes me frustrated (13:10 - 13:14)
that they did the 99 pricing is on (13:12 - 13:16)
clothing because you don't charge me tax (13:14 - 13:18)
so I have to pay 20. that's a very (13:16 - 13:20)
Minnesota thing about Greg I know it's (13:18 - 13:21)
dumb though (13:20 - 13:24)
it's a Minnesota problem but it is a (13:21 - 13:26)
dumb problem like at Minnesota's Roundup (13:24 - 13:28)
on clothing we're not paying tax on it (13:26 - 13:29)
we know that this is the price just (13:28 - 13:32)
charge me 30 dollars (13:29 - 13:35)
for people that don't know you don't (13:32 - 13:37)
have to pay sales tax on clothing in (13:35 - 13:38)
Minnesota so you buy a pair of shoes (13:37 - 13:41)
yeah our taxes are like slightly higher (13:38 - 13:44)
yeah I mean I'm in I'm in Oregon so I (13:41 - 13:45)
don't pay sales tax on anything (13:44 - 13:48)
that's valid so you don't pay you don't (13:45 - 13:51)
pay tax on food and you don't pay tax on (13:48 - 13:53)
clothing the two things that they deem (13:51 - 13:56)
Necessities interesting you don't pay (13:53 - 13:57)
tax on (13:56 - 14:00)
okay side note I worked at Panera very (13:57 - 14:03)
early on and it was the same thing in (14:00 - 14:05)
Wisconsin you don't pay sales tax on (14:03 - 14:06)
food (14:05 - 14:09)
so the old people would come in and at (14:06 - 14:13)
Panera if you ordered something to go it (14:09 - 14:15)
would be considered a food purchase (14:13 - 14:17)
slash Bakery (14:15 - 14:19)
so it wouldn't get taxed but if you (14:17 - 14:21)
ordered it for here (14:19 - 14:24)
it was considered like a restaurant so (14:21 - 14:26)
it was taxed so the old people would (14:24 - 14:28)
come in they would get their coffee and (14:26 - 14:30)
their bagel and then they would say to (14:28 - 14:32)
go we put in a bag and a to-go cup and (14:30 - 14:33)
then they would walk and sit down and (14:32 - 14:35)
eat it because they wanted to say if (14:33 - 14:38)
they're like seven cents yep yeah that's (14:35 - 14:42)
that is also that it happens here (14:38 - 14:42)
um anyways (14:43 - 14:46)
Hannah did you give your input on this I (14:46 - 14:51)
think Greg went uh I mean it's bad it's (14:48 - 14:54)
bad um I had a friend text me that day (14:51 - 14:57)
just saying so Pokey oh I had a friend (14:54 - 14:59)
text me that day saying so people are (14:57 - 15:01)
really angry at Pokemon go for some (14:59 - 15:03)
reason today (15:01 - 15:05)
and I had to go and explain the whole (15:03 - 15:07)
thing to them I have to say when I first (15:05 - 15:10)
read the blog post I was actually kind (15:07 - 15:12)
of excited that remote raid passes are (15:10 - 15:13)
going to be in research breakthroughs (15:12 - 15:16)
because I don't really buy remote raid (15:13 - 15:18)
passes very much myself (15:16 - 15:21)
so I might actually end up using them (15:18 - 15:23)
more after this just because of that (15:21 - 15:25)
depending on how common they are in the (15:23 - 15:27)
research breakthroughs but I do think (15:25 - 15:30)
this is a really bad move for a lot of (15:27 - 15:33)
online communities in particular I'm not (15:30 - 15:35)
going to be able to raid with people (15:33 - 15:38)
with friends elsewhere nearly as much (15:35 - 15:40)
not going to be able to really play with (15:38 - 15:43)
or help out friends elsewhere nearly as (15:40 - 15:46)
much and I think that that's (15:43 - 15:48)
that's a huge shame I understand the (15:46 - 15:52)
communities in person being important to (15:48 - 15:55)
the values of the game and I also enjoy (15:52 - 15:59)
those aspects to the I have experienced (15:55 - 16:01)
those and I have enjoyed them but I do (15:59 - 16:03)
have friends online I do have friends on (16:01 - 16:05)
the other side of the country and in (16:03 - 16:06)
other countries and those are people I (16:05 - 16:09)
like playing with so this sucks (16:06 - 16:13)
yeah it also like again (16:09 - 16:16)
it's uh if you can't get out (16:13 - 16:19)
for whatever reason tax like it it is an (16:16 - 16:22)
ADA tax really (16:19 - 16:24)
um like if you want to play the game but (16:22 - 16:27)
you are incapable of meeting the walking (16:24 - 16:29)
or going places requirement then you are (16:27 - 16:33)
being charged extra money for reasons uh (16:29 - 16:36)
which is not it's not great it's not (16:33 - 16:38)
great when you sort of (16:36 - 16:41)
do that that stuff (16:38 - 16:43)
um I would also said like the five a day (16:41 - 16:47)
is maybe less egregious than the money (16:43 - 16:50)
uh both aren't great yeah I was thinking (16:47 - 16:53)
that too but the like (16:50 - 16:56)
only the hardest hardcore probably did (16:53 - 16:58)
more than five (16:56 - 17:01)
um until then you're doing (16:58 - 17:03)
you're you're doing your hardcore people (17:01 - 17:07)
a little dirty uh as well (17:03 - 17:09)
um overall it's just like again this is (17:07 - 17:12)
like okay this is a corporate thing (17:09 - 17:14)
yeah um (17:12 - 17:17)
I wanted to talk about that more than (17:14 - 17:19)
what could be changed because I don't (17:17 - 17:21)
think anything's going to be changed no (17:19 - 17:24)
um like (17:21 - 17:24)
I I think trainer tips Nick said it the (17:24 - 17:28)
best in his video is like (17:26 - 17:32)
you can go on Twitter or social and be (17:28 - 17:33)
mad at Niantic and try to reach out to (17:32 - 17:36)
Niantic and he's like he's like kind of (17:33 - 17:40)
save your breath because they already we (17:36 - 17:42)
tried like yeah like we tried to do it (17:40 - 17:44)
for you (17:42 - 17:47)
um and uh there they didn't listen to us (17:44 - 17:50)
uh if you're if you're truly upset (17:47 - 17:53)
um the best advice I can give you is to (17:50 - 17:56)
take take a break yep from the game (17:53 - 17:58)
um it'll still be there when you get (17:56 - 18:00)
back this season is very lackluster so (17:58 - 18:01)
far (18:00 - 18:02)
if you just want to come back for (18:01 - 18:05)
commune days like don't feel bad like (18:02 - 18:06)
come back for communities they're fun (18:05 - 18:08)
they're great like come back play (18:06 - 18:09)
Community Day and then you know put the (18:08 - 18:10)
game away (18:09 - 18:12)
I (18:10 - 18:15)
I do think there is a little bit of I I (18:12 - 18:17)
don't think the people being upset or (18:15 - 18:23)
being angry is overblown I do think the (18:17 - 18:23)
the the (18:23 - 18:27)
Niantic you have just killed your own (18:25 - 18:31)
game has been overblown yeah because (18:27 - 18:33)
I think this is like the National dex (18:31 - 18:34)
issue all over again where people are (18:33 - 18:36)
like everyone cares about all the (18:34 - 18:38)
Pokemon sword and shield is going to be (18:36 - 18:39)
the worst selling games of all time (18:38 - 18:41)
because of this and then we it's just (18:39 - 18:44)
that's just not true like a very small (18:41 - 18:46)
amount of people caring about the entire (18:44 - 18:48)
Pokedex those people were very loud and (18:46 - 18:50)
very vocal it did not kill sword and (18:48 - 18:52)
shield it did not kill Legends it did (18:50 - 18:54)
not kill scarlet and violet not and I (18:52 - 18:56)
think it's the same here we get (18:54 - 18:57)
a lot of (18:56 - 19:01)
people or the there are there the the (18:57 - 19:02)
thing that affects the most are the (19:01 - 19:04)
people who only play exclusively online (19:02 - 19:07)
but that I think is a small set of (19:04 - 19:10)
people in the grand scale of Pokemon go (19:07 - 19:13)
like Pokemon go has so many players and (19:10 - 19:16)
I truly think the average player is (19:13 - 19:18)
playing on Kimi days (19:16 - 19:20)
maybe spending (19:18 - 19:23)
five bucks a month (19:20 - 19:26)
to you know maybe I feel like that's a (19:23 - 19:28)
little higher that's high but like (19:26 - 19:29)
putting a couple dollars into the game (19:28 - 19:31)
maybe that's a better way to phrase it (19:29 - 19:32)
putting a couple dollars into the game (19:31 - 19:34)
definitely playing on community days (19:32 - 19:36)
maybe playing on April fools because (19:34 - 19:40)
it's a 15 minute thing but but the when (19:36 - 19:41)
you read comments on like a Twitter (19:40 - 19:44)
thread of like I do it I do minimum 20 (19:41 - 19:46)
rides a day this is gonna hurt me so (19:44 - 19:49)
much like that is not an average player (19:46 - 19:51)
no an average player is not spending 20 (19:49 - 19:53)
a day on a mobile game every single day (19:51 - 19:57)
even five dollars a day on a mobile game (19:53 - 20:00)
every single day is 35 a week that's (19:57 - 20:02)
that that is not that that is a whale (20:00 - 20:05)
and the whales keep those keep these (20:02 - 20:08)
games afloat uh but if niantic's looking (20:05 - 20:10)
at like okay whale I I don't actually (20:08 - 20:12)
know the study this is not Pokemon go (20:10 - 20:14)
specifically but I don't know how fast (20:12 - 20:17)
whales burn out of games (20:14 - 20:19)
versus (20:17 - 20:20)
even though a whale might spend a lot of (20:19 - 20:22)
money (20:20 - 20:25)
very quickly and a lot like does a (20:22 - 20:27)
person who just enjoys the game and (20:25 - 20:30)
plays (20:27 - 20:30)
I don't know (20:30 - 20:33)
two hours a week every week do they end (20:31 - 20:36)
up being a better customer I have no (20:33 - 20:39)
clue what that is but like (20:36 - 20:39)
I I'm almost level 50 in the game and I (20:40 - 20:46)
probably I think realistically I give (20:43 - 20:50)
Niantic no more than 10 to 15 a month I (20:46 - 20:52)
maybe use and this is just me like I'm (20:50 - 20:54)
not saying I'm like better or like this (20:52 - 20:56)
is how players should play I'm just I'm (20:54 - 20:57)
just giving you my experience I I (20:56 - 20:59)
probably used maybe three remote raid (20:57 - 21:01)
passes a week (20:59 - 21:03)
um in person raids I try to do once a (21:01 - 21:05)
day assuming I leave my house and it's (21:03 - 21:06)
just like okay I have a free rate pass (21:05 - 21:08)
uh Bellsprout I guess I'm doing (21:06 - 21:10)
Bellsprout before I head home (21:08 - 21:12)
um (21:10 - 21:12)
but like I got there very few days I (21:12 - 21:18)
have done more than five there are a (21:16 - 21:19)
couple days where I've done more than (21:18 - 21:22)
five and that's usually yeah it usually (21:19 - 21:23)
is (21:22 - 21:25)
um like a Kanto Fest or a joke like it's (21:23 - 21:27)
usually one of those events and I I (21:25 - 21:29)
thought that it was notable when someone (21:27 - 21:32)
pointed out that they did the Primal (21:29 - 21:35)
raids before this change so they just (21:32 - 21:37)
got that last little wave of everybody (21:35 - 21:40)
doing many many many remote raids in the (21:37 - 21:43)
cold weather right before they locked (21:40 - 21:46)
all the remote raids down so that that (21:43 - 21:49)
is kind of better I think like there was (21:46 - 21:51)
an old study I think last Sunday really (21:49 - 21:53)
looked at the amount uh it was like 2014 (21:51 - 21:56)
2015. that said like (21:53 - 22:00)
0.15 percent of mobile players make up (21:56 - 22:03)
fifty percent of that game's Revenue (22:00 - 22:04)
so (22:03 - 22:08)
the people the whales who carry it are a (22:04 - 22:10)
tiny tiny tiny fraction generally like (22:08 - 22:12)
even if you say okay that's probably the (22:10 - 22:13)
one is increased now it's probably (22:12 - 22:16)
increased to maybe one percent carries (22:13 - 22:19)
fifty percent of a mobiles of a mobile (22:16 - 22:22)
game business and it's hard to say (22:19 - 22:26)
when that person is going to have enough (22:22 - 22:28)
when they're going to be like (22:26 - 22:32)
I I don't enjoy this anymore and you (22:28 - 22:34)
know they I'm sure that they have (22:32 - 22:37)
all the data that they need to know how (22:34 - 22:39)
big of an impact this actually is going (22:37 - 22:41)
to make like they know I'm sure yeah (22:39 - 22:43)
yeah they know who pays they know where (22:41 - 22:45)
you play they know how often you play it (22:43 - 22:47)
they know when you log in like you are (22:45 - 22:49)
using their data and they are collecting (22:47 - 22:52)
it to make all of these decisions so I I (22:49 - 22:54)
do always roll my eyes when people like (22:52 - 22:56)
this is the end of your game it's like (22:54 - 22:59)
well it's not unless (22:56 - 23:01)
the people who support it (22:59 - 23:04)
hit their limit and those are the people (23:01 - 23:06)
that they are constantly worried about (23:04 - 23:09)
because people who like me who pay five (23:06 - 23:11)
dollars every (23:09 - 23:14)
two or three years I I am not their (23:11 - 23:16)
ideal customer right like they are not (23:14 - 23:20)
making decisions to keep me happy (23:16 - 23:22)
because I don't give them money they're (23:20 - 23:24)
more likely to make decisions to keep (23:22 - 23:27)
Steve happy than yeah (23:24 - 23:30)
I I I didn't mean to be niantic's (23:27 - 23:33)
perfect customer but I I am like I I I (23:30 - 23:35)
don't like playing at home I I used to (23:33 - 23:37)
play with somebody who they wanted to (23:35 - 23:39)
play in the car they wanted to drive (23:37 - 23:41)
from pokestop to pokestop and they did (23:39 - 23:44)
not want to walk and I hated that play (23:41 - 23:45)
style like I was like let's just go (23:44 - 23:47)
downtown park and walk around and they (23:45 - 23:49)
did not want to do that (23:47 - 23:50)
um (23:49 - 23:54)
I I don't buy incubators (23:50 - 23:57)
but like I do do almost I do almost (23:54 - 23:59)
every event and go and I genuinely do (23:57 - 24:02)
like to go outside and walk and like if (23:59 - 24:04)
I'm at home I don't want to open go I (24:02 - 24:05)
just don't like I have other games (24:04 - 24:07)
around me at home that I want to play (24:05 - 24:08)
instead so like (24:07 - 24:11)
when I'm out I am playing go uh and I (24:08 - 24:13)
enjoy that so I I do I did end up being (24:11 - 24:17)
like the Niantic perfect customer of (24:13 - 24:19)
like this person opens this app (24:17 - 24:21)
frequently when they are outside their (24:19 - 24:23)
house and we're getting the location (24:21 - 24:27)
data on them I guess yeah I mean I I (24:23 - 24:31)
don't I tend to own like when it becomes (24:27 - 24:33)
warm again and I'm walking outside I (24:31 - 24:34)
will probably start using daily (24:33 - 24:37)
instances again but I don't particularly (24:34 - 24:40)
enjoy driving 20 minutes to Mall of (24:37 - 24:42)
America to walk around Mall of America (24:40 - 24:44)
for an hour and a half like sometimes (24:42 - 24:45)
it's nice when it's not busy though like (24:44 - 24:47)
when Walmart America's like busy it's (24:45 - 24:48)
kind of like oh let's just get this done (24:47 - 24:50)
with like you've convinced me multiple (24:48 - 24:53)
times you're like you know come on out (24:50 - 24:55)
and I'll make fine I I'll make the trip (24:53 - 24:57)
but that is not my ideal (24:55 - 25:00)
experience to drive to a mall that has (24:57 - 25:03)
nothing for me in it to walk around (25:00 - 25:05)
yeah (25:03 - 25:05)
like I walk around my neighborhood I'll (25:06 - 25:11)
go up to the Art Park when it's warm and (25:09 - 25:12)
I'm like I might as well have it open (25:11 - 25:14)
and do something while I'm while I'm (25:12 - 25:17)
walking around because it is (25:14 - 25:21)
it is an add-on to what I'm doing not (25:17 - 25:23)
the reason for what I'm doing and it (25:21 - 25:25)
never has been for me (25:23 - 25:26)
and I'm somewhere in between you two (25:25 - 25:29)
Pokemon go is frequently the reason I go (25:26 - 25:31)
outside otherwise I am I have definitely (25:29 - 25:33)
become someone who stays inside a whole (25:31 - 25:35)
bunch over the last three years (25:33 - 25:36)
um (25:35 - 25:39)
but I do play inside a fair amount but (25:36 - 25:41)
most of that most of that is Inventory (25:39 - 25:42)
management (25:41 - 25:45)
yeah let me introduce you to the Hard (25:42 - 25:48)
Mode They just added (25:45 - 25:52)
the last thing I want to say is (25:48 - 25:55)
um there there's also this this (25:52 - 25:58)
this online wave that happens when (25:55 - 26:00)
Niantic makes changes people don't like (25:58 - 26:02)
which is I can't I wish Nintendo or I (26:00 - 26:04)
wish Pokemon would take this away from (26:02 - 26:06)
Niantic and give it to another developer (26:04 - 26:10)
and I I want to stress (26:06 - 26:11)
that (26:10 - 26:15)
we've said this before Niantic cannot do (26:11 - 26:17)
anything without the Pokemon company's (26:15 - 26:20)
approval so it's not like Niantic was (26:17 - 26:22)
like let's limit the raid passes and (26:20 - 26:23)
jack up the prices and like hopefully (26:22 - 26:26)
papa pikachu isn't mad no they signed (26:23 - 26:29)
off on that they they would have had to (26:26 - 26:31)
um and I was like I I've told stories (26:29 - 26:33)
before of (26:31 - 26:35)
you know meeting John Henke in Germany (26:33 - 26:39)
and uh like talking to like Pokemon (26:35 - 26:43)
company employees and stuff and I I like (26:39 - 26:46)
was saying some story on on stream and (26:43 - 26:48)
somebody reached out to me and they were (26:46 - 26:50)
like can we get a source and (26:48 - 26:51)
verification of like (26:50 - 26:54)
who said what and I was like no man like (26:51 - 26:56)
I'm like (26:54 - 26:58)
I'm not gonna like throw a Pokemon (26:56 - 27:01)
employee under the bus because you like (26:58 - 27:04)
you want some like news story I was like (27:01 - 27:06)
I was like that wasn't even the point of (27:04 - 27:08)
the story the point of the story is (27:06 - 27:11)
uh or the or I know I'll give you the (27:08 - 27:13)
the short version is I like I like to I (27:11 - 27:15)
I knew people who worked on the Pokemon (27:13 - 27:18)
symphonic Evolutions tour right it was (27:15 - 27:20)
the the concert that went around the (27:18 - 27:21)
United States happened for like two (27:20 - 27:22)
years (27:21 - 27:23)
and (27:22 - 27:26)
they told me like take this with a grain (27:23 - 27:27)
of salt that's what I said you know on (27:26 - 27:30)
stream the other day that they could not (27:27 - 27:33)
change two songs around without the (27:30 - 27:36)
Pokemon company's approval (27:33 - 27:40)
they could not like uh you know Steven (27:36 - 27:41)
Stone's music would have went really (27:40 - 27:43)
good in the cynthias but like we got (27:41 - 27:45)
Cynthia first they couldn't change those (27:43 - 27:47)
around they couldn't add new songs they (27:45 - 27:48)
couldn't make songs longer they couldn't (27:47 - 27:50)
change they couldn't change any any (27:48 - 27:52)
single change they needed the Pokemon (27:50 - 27:55)
company's approval so if you think for a (27:52 - 27:57)
second that like (27:55 - 28:01)
the Pokemon company didn't approve (27:57 - 28:04)
these price changes the limit of raid (28:01 - 28:07)
passes of whoever is the next Community (28:04 - 28:09)
Pokemon like that was the whole point of (28:07 - 28:11)
the story the point of the story wasn't (28:09 - 28:13)
be like I got some Insider information (28:11 - 28:17)
no the whole point of the story was (28:13 - 28:19)
that at the end of the day the Pokemon (28:17 - 28:23)
company is still in charge of Pokemon go (28:19 - 28:26)
they might be like whatever Niantic sure (28:23 - 28:28)
change your prices but that they still (28:26 - 28:31)
are aware of it they've been still (28:28 - 28:33)
signing off they've still been told and (28:31 - 28:36)
I mean you can maybe argue how much (28:33 - 28:38)
somebody Within (28:36 - 28:40)
the Pokemon company really read the memo (28:38 - 28:42)
and was like oh I'm gonna think about (28:40 - 28:43)
the ramifications they're probably like (28:42 - 28:46)
oh that sounds great yep cool (28:43 - 28:48)
check (28:46 - 28:50)
I I used to work (28:48 - 28:52)
um (28:50 - 28:54)
but boy this is this this whole segment (28:52 - 28:55)
is just me (28:54 - 28:57)
remembering my old jobs (28:55 - 29:00)
I used to work for Apple (28:57 - 29:02)
and I worked in a retail store as a (29:00 - 29:04)
technician so I fixed computers and (29:02 - 29:06)
iPhones and stuff and then I got an (29:04 - 29:09)
opportunity to work out in California (29:06 - 29:11)
so I was working for corporate for a (29:09 - 29:13)
little bit and then eventually that (29:11 - 29:15)
corporate thing ended and I came back (29:13 - 29:18)
and it was very sad that well (29:15 - 29:21)
like I guess sad I was back in was (29:18 - 29:25)
back at a retail store but not sad that (29:21 - 29:26)
I was in California because I don't (29:25 - 29:27)
think I could ever live in California (29:26 - 29:29)
sorry to everyone who lives there I just (29:27 - 29:31)
I don't think I could live there it's (29:29 - 29:34)
expensive oh boy there's a lot (29:31 - 29:37)
uh but (29:34 - 29:40)
um what's always funny is and I think I (29:37 - 29:42)
think a lot of listeners can relate to (29:40 - 29:44)
this is like the micromanaging that (29:42 - 29:48)
happens at in that kind of (29:44 - 29:52)
um in your workplace so like (29:48 - 29:55)
because I I have meetings with Niantic (29:52 - 29:56)
every now and then we have like this (29:55 - 29:59)
huge non-disclosure form right (29:56 - 30:00)
and sometimes they give us news early (29:59 - 30:02)
and they're like you absolutely cannot (30:00 - 30:04)
talk about this until this time at this (30:02 - 30:05)
date (30:04 - 30:07)
and whatever I have none of that with (30:05 - 30:09)
the Pokemon company right like (30:07 - 30:11)
um sometimes the Pokemon company sends (30:09 - 30:13)
me a gift in the mail or they'll send me (30:11 - 30:14)
like Pokemon cards and they'll just be (30:13 - 30:16)
like hey if you get the Pokemon cards (30:14 - 30:17)
early you just can't open them until (30:16 - 30:19)
this date right like but I have no like (30:17 - 30:21)
legal written agreement with the Pokemon (30:19 - 30:24)
company at all I do with Niantic I do (30:21 - 30:26)
technically with DNA (30:24 - 30:27)
um and then I do with Nintendo and (30:26 - 30:29)
Nintendo's is like pretty much like (30:27 - 30:30)
don't play emulated games don't tell (30:29 - 30:33)
people how to get emulated games as long (30:30 - 30:35)
as you do that you know here's Pikmin 4 (30:33 - 30:37)
for free right (30:35 - 30:39)
um (30:37 - 30:39)
but uh so with all of those like (30:39 - 30:45)
non-disclosure like privacy agreements (30:43 - 30:48)
with Niantic you know I'm I'm restricted (30:45 - 30:49)
in what I can say and what I can't say (30:48 - 30:51)
but what I think it what I think is (30:49 - 30:52)
always funny is like when we were (30:51 - 30:54)
talking to John Hankey in Germany (30:52 - 30:58)
he was like he was like yeah like tell (30:54 - 31:00)
your communities like what I said he's (30:58 - 31:02)
like I want people like he's like I (31:00 - 31:05)
trust that you guys are making people (31:02 - 31:08)
like understand and appreciate and love (31:05 - 31:10)
our game and he's like you do so much (31:08 - 31:13)
good for Niantic so like it's it's I (31:10 - 31:15)
feel like sometimes when I bring that up (31:13 - 31:18)
like oh you know I had dinner with John (31:15 - 31:19)
Hankey and he said he didn't like the (31:18 - 31:23)
Pokeball plus like okay like sure write (31:19 - 31:27)
a new story about that I guess but it (31:23 - 31:30)
funny to to like tell John something and (31:27 - 31:31)
he'd be like oh I didn't hear that it's (31:30 - 31:33)
almost like anyways the point of the (31:31 - 31:35)
story is like John is obviously the CEO (31:33 - 31:38)
of Niantic he's the top dog right he (31:35 - 31:40)
cares very deeply about the games and (31:38 - 31:42)
that Niantic makes he was very into AR (31:40 - 31:44)
when we talked to him but then I feel (31:42 - 31:46)
like there's (31:44 - 31:48)
these lower (31:46 - 31:51)
Executives that are making these changes (31:48 - 31:54)
for prices and whatever and then there (31:51 - 31:57)
are the people lower than that are which (31:54 - 31:59)
are probably the people I deal with (31:57 - 32:01)
that are very passionate about Pokemon (31:59 - 32:02)
go (32:01 - 32:04)
and you know we come out of those (32:02 - 32:06)
meetings them with them being like (32:04 - 32:09)
passionate but then we get these like oh (32:06 - 32:11)
you didn't take any of your feedback (32:09 - 32:13)
but I know they're passionate people (32:11 - 32:15)
like I know that yeah they also care (32:13 - 32:17)
about the game I'm sure they heard the (32:15 - 32:20)
feedback so so it's it's weird because (32:17 - 32:23)
like Executives it's like the people I (32:20 - 32:25)
talk to at Niantic I can tell they love (32:23 - 32:27)
the game and then when I talk to John (32:25 - 32:29)
Henke (32:27 - 32:32)
it was like it seemed like he he like (32:29 - 32:34)
something got Lost in Translation and I (32:32 - 32:37)
feel like it's probably that the suits (32:34 - 32:39)
in the middle that are like how can we (32:37 - 32:44)
squeeze our customers to make well (32:39 - 32:47)
here's the thing that I have run into I (32:44 - 32:48)
have worked in (32:47 - 32:51)
uh uh a large corporation corporate job (32:48 - 32:55)
for a very very very long time and (32:51 - 32:57)
here both the very top will be like we (32:55 - 33:00)
need to do this figure it out and it's (32:57 - 33:02)
the people in the middle that have to (33:00 - 33:04)
figure that out and they can hear all (33:02 - 33:06)
the feedback that they need (33:04 - 33:07)
but (33:06 - 33:09)
that's going to stop at the people the (33:07 - 33:11)
middle because they have to make the (33:09 - 33:14)
thing that the top said has to happen so (33:11 - 33:17)
the amount of stoppage of feedback that (33:14 - 33:20)
goes up because (33:17 - 33:22)
great I understand that it hurts you (33:20 - 33:24)
understand we got the feedback but we (33:22 - 33:26)
still have these things that we have to (33:24 - 33:30)
do and giving that feedback up isn't (33:26 - 33:32)
going to say to them well then we're (33:30 - 33:33)
going to couple with another five (33:32 - 33:35)
million dollars this year because that's (33:33 - 33:37)
what you have to do so they don't tend (33:35 - 33:41)
to get that feedback because then (33:37 - 33:43)
they're going to be like well okay so (33:41 - 33:45)
what's your next idea and there are no (33:43 - 33:48)
ideas right like there is no way to get (33:45 - 33:51)
more money out of people unless you do x (33:48 - 33:55)
y z so it's not necessarily that they (33:51 - 33:58)
don't hear the feedback but like a CEO (33:55 - 34:00)
is probably never hearing any of the (33:58 - 34:02)
negative feedback because you're not (34:00 - 34:04)
going to do that you're they're going to (34:02 - 34:05)
say (34:04 - 34:07)
figure out how to meet my goals this is (34:05 - 34:09)
where the company is going and that is (34:07 - 34:11)
the end of that story (34:09 - 34:13)
no the end of the story is John Hankey (34:11 - 34:15)
left the beach and got onto his private (34:13 - 34:18)
helicopter (34:15 - 34:18)
[Laughter] (34:18 - 34:23)
um but no I I noticed that at Apple too (34:23 - 34:27)
where like what I felt like I had so (34:25 - 34:30)
much more freedom as an employee working (34:27 - 34:33)
at corporate and then when I got back to (34:30 - 34:36)
like retail it kind of sunk in that like (34:33 - 34:39)
the the retail managers were like this (34:36 - 34:42)
is so unacceptable in in our world and (34:39 - 34:44)
it was like what are you talking about (34:42 - 34:45)
like (34:44 - 34:49)
it what I was just a corporate for (34:45 - 34:51)
almost two months and that was fine (34:49 - 34:54)
there and it it was effective and it (34:51 - 34:56)
worked and like I don't know sometimes (34:54 - 34:58)
again I don't know I don't I I've never (34:56 - 35:01)
met like a suit at Niantic I don't I (34:58 - 35:02)
don't know what that looks like I don't (35:01 - 35:05)
know how unfun they are but (35:02 - 35:07)
definitely just feels like a situation (35:05 - 35:10)
where the higher-ups have a goal or a (35:07 - 35:12)
rule and they won't deviate from it yes (35:10 - 35:16)
that is that is Corporate 101 the upper (35:12 - 35:20)
says the goals and says figure it out (35:16 - 35:22)
like the only time I've ever really (35:20 - 35:24)
heard of (35:22 - 35:27)
a CEO shooting something down is when (35:24 - 35:29)
Costco wanted to raise the price of the (35:27 - 35:30)
hot dogs (35:29 - 35:33)
and he said he said absolutely not (35:30 - 35:35)
figure something I heard about that yep (35:33 - 35:39)
uh and they did but like (35:35 - 35:42)
generally it has been my experience and (35:39 - 35:44)
the experience of many many many people (35:42 - 35:46)
that I talk to that (35:44 - 35:48)
upper management sets the direction and (35:46 - 35:50)
middle management are the ones that have (35:48 - 35:51)
to figure out how to get there or they (35:50 - 35:55)
lose their job right like a suit can say (35:51 - 35:56)
no this is gonna be really bad for the (35:55 - 35:58)
customer base this isn't what we're (35:56 - 35:59)
going to do we can't do this we can't (35:58 - 36:03)
hit that goal they are replaced (35:59 - 36:06)
I do Wonder like (36:03 - 36:08)
I I know in companies it's like we have (36:06 - 36:10)
to hit this we have to hit these profits (36:08 - 36:12)
or we have to hit this revenue or we (36:10 - 36:13)
have to hit this money (36:12 - 36:17)
like Niantic still (36:13 - 36:19)
like they don't get all the money like (36:17 - 36:22)
Pokemon's getting some cut of whatever (36:19 - 36:25)
so I I wonder if Pokemon was also like (36:22 - 36:28)
hey we want more money too like I don't (36:25 - 36:30)
know I I don't (36:28 - 36:33)
I will never know what I mean what the (36:30 - 36:35)
split is of like one example that we (36:33 - 36:37)
have that matches that is Hasbro going (36:35 - 36:40)
after Magic the Gathering and Dungeons (36:37 - 36:43)
and Dragons where they did say you're a (36:40 - 36:45)
popular brand you're not making enough (36:43 - 36:48)
money figure out how to monetize more so (36:45 - 36:52)
it is very possible that Pokemon went to (36:48 - 36:53)
them and said (36:52 - 36:56)
we need better returns from you figure (36:53 - 36:58)
out how to do more (36:56 - 37:00)
um we just don't know how we don't know (36:58 - 37:03)
like how directly the Pokemon go goes (37:00 - 37:05)
into saying (37:03 - 37:07)
these are your Targets this is how much (37:05 - 37:09)
money you need to make I mean Niantic (37:07 - 37:12)
could be saying we've we promised to (37:09 - 37:13)
increase our revenues but not by how (37:12 - 37:15)
much and that keeps Pokemon company (37:13 - 37:17)
happy or Pokemon can say do you know (37:15 - 37:19)
what numbers are down across the board (37:17 - 37:22)
and you need to step up to support your (37:19 - 37:26)
pillar it's hard to say (37:22 - 37:26)
there was always that like (37:26 - 37:30)
when I think when remote raid passes (37:28 - 37:33)
were introduced around the time (37:30 - 37:35)
it was always that like (37:33 - 37:38)
maybe the Pokemon company doesn't like (37:35 - 37:41)
this because they have their at-home (37:38 - 37:45)
very popular games and this is like the (37:41 - 37:47)
leave your house kind of game (37:45 - 37:49)
and they don't want those two things to (37:47 - 37:51)
overlap the Pokemon company is also (37:49 - 37:54)
famously like we don't want to make a (37:51 - 37:55)
sequel because we don't know how it (37:54 - 37:58)
would be different than the last one and (37:55 - 37:59)
then their customers are like it doesn't (37:58 - 38:00)
have to be different we want the same (37:59 - 38:02)
thing (38:00 - 38:04)
well it's sort of hard you kind of look (38:02 - 38:06)
at things like well (38:04 - 38:08)
they put out like if you're gonna use (38:06 - 38:09)
the argument that they don't want (38:08 - 38:10)
another home game then why did they (38:09 - 38:13)
allow unite to happen which is (38:10 - 38:16)
in essence a home game I mean it has a (38:13 - 38:18)
mobile component now (38:16 - 38:20)
um I think one of the the things that we (38:18 - 38:22)
have to keep in mind is that every (38:20 - 38:24)
subdivision is fighting for an identity (38:22 - 38:26)
because they're fighting for resources (38:24 - 38:29)
and if you don't have a strong identity (38:26 - 38:31)
uh then you're probably not going to get (38:29 - 38:33)
the resources and when faced with (38:31 - 38:37)
multiple decent mobile games Pokemon go (38:33 - 38:40)
as being the mobile game vanished and so (38:37 - 38:42)
they had to lean heavily into the one (38:40 - 38:45)
thing effects on their customers out the (38:42 - 38:47)
window like (38:45 - 38:49)
than they did and they are leaning hard (38:47 - 38:51)
into that one thing again if you don't (38:49 - 38:53)
fit their model you're out the window (38:51 - 38:55)
and that is the decision that they made (38:53 - 38:57)
and like there's not a way to get around (38:55 - 38:59)
that that's not a way to say oh it's (38:57 - 39:02)
tpc's fault I mean they needed a unique (38:59 - 39:05)
identity they came up with we're the (39:02 - 39:07)
game where you walk and they will not (39:05 - 39:10)
deviate from that and you need to be a (39:07 - 39:12)
customer that fits that model or it's (39:10 - 39:16)
not a game for you (39:12 - 39:16)
just like you need to be a customer that (39:17 - 39:22)
is okay with getting frustrated every 10 (39:20 - 39:24)
minutes in order to play Unite (39:22 - 39:27)
valid but (39:24 - 39:29)
that's only 10 minutes (39:27 - 39:32)
[Laughter] (39:29 - 39:36)
all right uh well that's that's I think (39:32 - 39:39)
that's we'll see we'll see what happens (39:36 - 39:42)
uh I don't think much is gonna happen I (39:39 - 39:43)
think they're gonna try to ride this (39:42 - 39:46)
through and and go into the summer with (39:43 - 39:49)
this which again I guess the the the (39:46 - 39:51)
best thing you can say is they did it (39:49 - 39:53)
early summer is their busy season summer (39:51 - 39:57)
is their like Christmas for this game (39:53 - 40:00)
um North American Summer sorry Australia (39:57 - 40:03)
yeah sorry uh Japan and North American (40:00 - 40:06)
Summer is is there (40:03 - 40:08)
we'll see how this goes with the next (40:06 - 40:10)
big events that have raids that people (40:08 - 40:12)
are interested in and we'll see how this (40:10 - 40:14)
goes once it gets back into I mean I (40:12 - 40:16)
know it's still the colder months here (40:14 - 40:18)
some places and I know it's about to be (40:16 - 40:19)
the colder months in the southern (40:18 - 40:20)
hemisphere but we'll see how it goes (40:19 - 40:23)
when this place gets back into these (40:20 - 40:25)
solidly Frozen months next year because (40:23 - 40:27)
that's when people don't want to go out (40:25 - 40:29)
and do raids yep yeah and it's not like (40:27 - 40:33)
raids have been very good you did you (40:29 - 40:35)
guys need another Lugia because that was (40:33 - 40:39)
like the 18th time yeah they're good for (40:35 - 40:40)
new players but (40:39 - 40:42)

we come back we have a bunch of scarlet (40:45 - 40:50)

very long time since it came out on (42:44 - 42:48)
March 31st people couldn't decide if it (42:46 - 42:50)
was a joke or not oh oh I a million (42:48 - 42:52)
percent thought it was an April Fool's (42:50 - 42:54)
joke because it (42:52 - 42:57)
I mean and it still is right like it's (42:54 - 42:59)
still a joke but yeah yeah yeah but the (42:57 - 43:02)
amount of people who are like (42:59 - 43:05)
should I drive to the GameStop on the (43:02 - 43:07)
fact that this could be a joke and look (43:05 - 43:10)
like a complete idiot by walking it and (43:07 - 43:12)
saying do you have any (43:10 - 43:15)
it would really be the ultimate April (43:12 - 43:17)
Fool's joke (43:15 - 43:23)
who looked at it when this why (43:17 - 43:23)
you can't get it in a church ball yeah (43:25 - 43:30)
who cares with the ribbon oh I care (43:27 - 43:31)
about the cherish ball yeah that's the (43:30 - 43:33)
one thing I wasn't interested until I (43:31 - 43:35)
heard it how to cherish ball oh I was I (43:33 - 43:39)
was very I was all into the cherish ball (43:35 - 43:41)
I (43:39 - 43:41)
think live streaming on when did they (43:41 - 43:45)
announce this they announced this on (43:44 - 43:47)
like a Tuesday or something right so (43:45 - 43:48)
it's like everyone's still trying to (43:47 - 43:49)
figure out if this is an April Fool's (43:48 - 43:50)
joke or not (43:49 - 43:52)
and I'm streaming and we're looking at (43:50 - 43:54)
it and I'm like I'm when Gamestop (43:52 - 43:56)
tweeted it but when you click the link (43:54 - 43:57)
that GameStop (43:56 - 44:00)
provided it just went to gamestop.com it (43:57 - 44:03)
didn't like give you any details yeah so (44:00 - 44:05)
you're like is this an April Fool's joke (44:03 - 44:07)
and I'm like we're I'm talking about it (44:05 - 44:09)
with my twitch Community for like 10 (44:07 - 44:10)
minutes and all of a sudden I get a (44:09 - 44:12)
message from somebody who works at the (44:10 - 44:14)
Pokemon company and all it says is it's (44:12 - 44:16)
real (44:14 - 44:16)
they're doing it (44:18 - 44:24)
I was like I it's real I was told it's (44:21 - 44:26)
real hey it is real (44:24 - 44:30)
um yeah so uh whatever that's a it's a (44:26 - 44:31)
cool event I know (44:30 - 44:33)
you know this is I think this is the (44:31 - 44:36)
first uh I don't want to say big event (44:33 - 44:38)
this is the first (44:36 - 44:41)
okay distribution that they've done a (44:38 - 44:42)
lot of little distributions they've been (44:41 - 44:43)
a lot of sandwich ingredients they've (44:42 - 44:45)
given some Battle Points they've given (44:43 - 44:46)
some TMS there's the Pikachu at the (44:45 - 44:48)
beginning there was a beach at the (44:46 - 44:50)
beginning yeah yeah I think I think Mr (44:48 - 44:53)
Joe sarabe said that the first similar (44:50 - 44:55)
distribution (44:53 - 44:59)
uh for sword and shield was around May (44:55 - 45:01)
um so again like there are there are a (44:59 - 45:04)
lot more little little or smaller (45:01 - 45:05)
distributions that people are like this (45:04 - 45:06)
isn't worth it (45:05 - 45:08)
I don't know people are still gonna be (45:06 - 45:09)
like this isn't worth it because (45:08 - 45:11)
whatever distributions you just have to (45:09 - 45:13)
put in the code I feel like that's worth (45:11 - 45:16)
it yeah I mean there's a lot of times I (45:13 - 45:18)
look at that and go (45:16 - 45:20)
no (45:18 - 45:22)
my game is like always on so (45:20 - 45:25)

coming soon from Thursday March 30th to (46:26 - 46:31)
Thursday April 6 until midnight UTC (46:29 - 46:35)
which I think is like 7 P.M central time (46:31 - 46:38)
um you can sign up the competition will (46:35 - 46:40)
begin uh (46:38 - 46:43)
UTC and when we get literally minutes (46:40 - 46:46)
after it ends for sign ups it will begin (46:43 - 46:48)
Friday uh April 7th (46:46 - 46:52)
at midnight UTC which is again Thursday (46:48 - 46:55)
night around 701 PM it will go until (46:52 - 46:59)
Sunday April 9th (46:55 - 47:02)
uh you log into Scarlet Violet you go to (46:59 - 47:04)
Pokey portal you go to battle Stadium (47:02 - 47:06)
you go to online competitions and then (47:04 - 47:09)
under online competitions you select (47:06 - 47:11)
search for a competition (47:09 - 47:14)
uh if you participate which is you must (47:11 - 47:17)
finish three matches it does not matter (47:14 - 47:20)
if you win or lose you just must do (47:17 - 47:22)
three matches (47:20 - 47:25)
uh and your account is linked to home (47:22 - 47:26)
which it should be because you probably (47:25 - 47:29)
did that for sword and shield or Legends (47:26 - 47:30)
Arceus like you should (47:29 - 47:33)
have it linked you will receive a (47:30 - 47:35)
Pokeball canvas backpack in the game not (47:33 - 47:38)
a real one a digital one and you will (47:35 - 47:40)
receive 10 000 leak points if you don't (47:38 - 47:42)
connect your home you will just get 10 (47:40 - 47:45)
000 leak points again you have to do (47:42 - 47:48)
three matches so if if you are not a (47:45 - 47:50)
competitive person you can bring in a a (47:48 - 47:53)
magnazone uh an electrode and a (47:50 - 47:56)
gargnacle and you can just hit explode (47:53 - 47:58)
on all of them it'll make it go quicker (47:56 - 48:00)
you just hit the explode button boom (47:58 - 48:02)
give your teammate a give your opponent (48:00 - 48:03)
a good time (48:02 - 48:06)
the difference between this and sword (48:03 - 48:08)
and shield I don't know why this is and (48:06 - 48:10)
I'm I'm already mad about it is when you (48:08 - 48:13)
go to sign up I'm already mad when you (48:10 - 48:15)
go to sign up it will ask for your team (48:13 - 48:17)
and it will lock your team in right away (48:15 - 48:20)
oh whereas in sword and shield you could (48:17 - 48:23)
sign up and then (48:20 - 48:24)
you could start The Challenge on like (48:23 - 48:27)
Sunday it would lock your team in then (48:24 - 48:29)
and then you would do your matches and (48:27 - 48:30)
then it would unlock it when the (48:29 - 48:32)
tournament is over so (48:30 - 48:33)
um (48:32 - 48:35)
I don't know why (48:33 - 48:36)
so you really want to be signing up at (48:35 - 48:39)
the last minute basically yes yeah but (48:36 - 48:41)
not too late to when it already starts (48:39 - 48:44)
because once it starts you cannot sign (48:41 - 48:46)
up (48:44 - 48:49)
um and (48:46 - 48:49)
what was the other thing there was like (48:50 - 48:53)
another frequently Asked question when (48:51 - 48:55)
this happened in sword and shield oh the (48:53 - 48:57)
reward you don't get the reward after (48:55 - 48:59)
three matches you get the reward when (48:57 - 49:02)
the tournament is over and rankings are (48:59 - 49:05)
posted so that might be Monday or (49:02 - 49:07)
Tuesday sometimes it can take a week but (49:05 - 49:09)
that was a big thing for like the the (49:07 - 49:11)
gallerian birds was like I did my three (49:09 - 49:13)
batches where's my Articuno and it's (49:11 - 49:15)
like yeah the tournament's not a (49:13 - 49:16)
tournament (49:15 - 49:17)
yeah (49:16 - 49:20)
now to compare those to the legendary (49:17 - 49:21)
birds people are like well we got shiny (49:20 - 49:24)
legendary birds we did but also the (49:21 - 49:26)
first couple Global online challenges (49:24 - 49:29)
for Scarlett and violet gave us ball guy (49:26 - 49:30)
shirts (49:29 - 49:32)
those are good (49:30 - 49:35)
if anything you could wear them and you (49:32 - 49:37)
could actually share them although I'm (49:35 - 49:39)
still mad there was no luxury ball guy (49:37 - 49:41)
shirt and yes I will never forgive them (49:39 - 49:43)
and never participate ever again I think (49:41 - 49:46)
it was Pokeball great ball Ultra Ball So (49:43 - 49:48)
if if we were to point at any pattern (49:46 - 49:51)
since this is a Pokeball backpack it may (49:48 - 49:53)
be safe to assume the next online (49:51 - 49:54)
competition will give us a great ball (49:53 - 49:56)
backpack and the one after that will (49:54 - 49:57)
give us an Ultra Ball and I'm looking at (49:56 - 49:59)
the backpack and it is not that cute (49:57 - 50:02)
it's okay uh it does look like one you (49:59 - 50:05)
would get from Hot Topic oh a Hot Topic (50:02 - 50:07)
Outlet (50:05 - 50:07)
I would suggest signing up uh (50:11 - 50:16)
uh Wednesday night or Thursday morning (50:14 - 50:18)
because again it does lock your team (50:16 - 50:20)
unless your team is ready but if if you (50:18 - 50:22)
are a competitive person you probably (50:20 - 50:23)
don't want to lock your team because (50:22 - 50:25)
then you can't use it in ranked battles (50:23 - 50:26)
so (50:25 - 50:29)
I don't know uh (50:26 - 50:32)
you can use every Pokemon every Pokemon (50:29 - 50:34)
is allowed except (50:32 - 50:37)
maridon and Corydon and technically (50:34 - 50:40)
Charizard Greninja Samurai those are not (50:37 - 50:41)
allowed because they don't have a (50:40 - 50:42)
Pokedex number (50:41 - 50:44)
so if it doesn't have a Pokedex number (50:42 - 50:46)
you can't use it and then if it the only (50:44 - 50:48)
two Pokemon with a Pokedex number (50:46 - 50:50)
meridon and Corydon are the only two (50:48 - 50:53)
that are banned so you can use (50:50 - 50:56)
Ting Lou if you want to just try to spam (50:53 - 50:59)
fissure which is if you watch the (50:56 - 51:00)
competition this weekend that's just (50:59 - 51:02)
what everyone was doing was we're just (51:00 - 51:04)
all spamming fissure and people are (51:02 - 51:05)
winning (51:04 - 51:08)
oh side note there was I think I don't (51:05 - 51:09)
think it was a masters League I think it (51:08 - 51:12)
was Juniors or whatever there there was (51:09 - 51:14)
um (51:12 - 51:14)
a a person who spammed fissure and they (51:15 - 51:21)
won and their opponent was so mad they (51:19 - 51:22)
just walked off stage (51:21 - 51:26)
oh wow well no like no handshake no good (51:22 - 51:28)
game just (51:26 - 51:28)
I mean (51:29 - 51:36)
do be fair same yeah I mean I mean to be (51:31 - 51:38)
fair same yeah (51:36 - 51:41)
sure yeah when you hit when you hit a 30 (51:38 - 51:44)
chance one hit KO move four times in a (51:41 - 51:45)
row (51:44 - 51:49)
Ah that's very tilt-inducing like you (51:45 - 51:50)
know what (51:49 - 51:51)
I'm gonna go and rethink my life right (51:50 - 51:52)
now (51:51 - 51:55)
I'm gonna go maybe make different (51:52 - 51:58)
decisions and think about the route that (51:55 - 52:00)
got me here (51:58 - 52:00)
yeah (52:03 - 52:07)
um okay uh should have done the TCG news (52:04 - 52:09)
in between we got one more bit of (52:07 - 52:10)
scarlet and violet news but well I guess (52:09 - 52:12)
you know this is Scarlet Violet news (52:10 - 52:14)
since it's TCG Scarlet Violet news uh (52:12 - 52:17)
there are new Rarity symbols (52:14 - 52:21)
um so moving forward there are some new (52:17 - 52:22)
symbols to make it easier to tell how (52:21 - 52:25)
rare or not rare your Pokemon is I (52:22 - 52:26)
actually think this is really great this (52:25 - 52:28)
is great as an adult (52:26 - 52:30)
collecting cards (52:28 - 52:32)
the only thing I can go off of is like (52:30 - 52:35)
price like my card is five dollars and (52:32 - 52:38)
your card is two dollars (52:35 - 52:41)
like that's really hard to which which (52:38 - 52:44)
is a fair way to trade but like I I (52:41 - 52:46)
don't know I can't remember is like a (52:44 - 52:48)
secret rare more rare than a rainbow (52:46 - 52:51)
rare or less rare than a gold rare is (52:48 - 52:53)
the colder the rarest one they changed (52:51 - 52:57)
the symbols so it should be easier here (52:53 - 52:58)
so (52:57 - 53:01)
there are the same common which is a (52:58 - 53:03)
circle uncommon which is a (53:01 - 53:04)
diamond (53:03 - 53:08)
and rare which is a star (53:04 - 53:10)
um and now there are known there are new (53:08 - 53:13)
symbols so there's a double rare (53:10 - 53:15)
actually the more I look at this maybe (53:13 - 53:16)
it's not better double a little (53:15 - 53:19)
confusing (53:16 - 53:21)
a double rare is two stars (53:19 - 53:23)
and then there's an ultra rare which is (53:21 - 53:25)
also two stars but the difference is a (53:23 - 53:28)
double rare is black stars and an ultra (53:25 - 53:31)
rare is silver stars yeah so is the (53:28 - 53:34)
silver going to be shiny like I'm (53:31 - 53:35)
assuming that the silver and gold are (53:34 - 53:38)
going to be shiny I hope so because this (53:35 - 53:40)
is not a better system than magic that (53:38 - 53:43)
literally just uses letters (53:40 - 53:43)
um (53:43 - 53:46)
and then brand new illness brand new (53:44 - 53:48)
Rarity known as illustration rare will (53:46 - 53:52)
be represented by one Shiny Gold Star (53:48 - 53:54)
illustration rares are an alternative (53:52 - 53:57)
version of common and uncommon and are (53:54 - 54:00)
rare of a rare Pokemon and rare Pokemon (53:57 - 54:02)
depicted with beautiful full art foil (54:00 - 54:04)
illustrations often showcase characters (54:02 - 54:07)
personality or environment (54:04 - 54:09)
the brand new Rarity also known as (54:07 - 54:12)
special illustration rares encompasses (54:09 - 54:15)
an alternative art cards for ex or (54:12 - 54:18)
supporters which also feature full art (54:15 - 54:19)
foil illustrations capturing characters (54:18 - 54:22)
unique traits or environments lastly (54:19 - 54:25)
hyper rare will be represented with (54:22 - 54:28)
three shiny gold stars hyper rare cards (54:25 - 54:32)
were previously known as secret rare and (54:28 - 54:35)
they are full art cards with gilded (54:32 - 54:38)
borders and accents so an illustration (54:35 - 54:39)
rare (54:38 - 54:43)
which is a common or an uncommon yes (54:39 - 54:47)
is a gold star (54:43 - 54:50)
and then a special illustration rare is (54:47 - 54:52)
two gold stars and then a hyper rare is (54:50 - 54:55)
three gold stars (54:52 - 54:55)
yeah it's bet better (54:57 - 55:01)
not perfect it's better I think that (54:59 - 55:03)
when they're on the cards they might (55:01 - 55:04)
look a little bit better than they do (55:03 - 55:07)
kind of on their own and it does say (55:04 - 55:10)
that they will be uh shiny symbols for (55:07 - 55:14)
the silver and gold so that'll help too (55:10 - 55:14)
I I don't know why you just couldn't do (55:15 - 55:19)
the letters (55:17 - 55:22)
they already had they already had the (55:19 - 55:25)
the circle the diamond and the star (55:22 - 55:27)
um surely (55:25 - 55:30)
there's another symbol that we could (55:27 - 55:32)
have included surely (55:30 - 55:35)
circles squares and stars are not the (55:32 - 55:36)
only three shapes in the universe (55:35 - 55:39)
instead of having six different versions (55:36 - 55:43)
of the star yeah sure (55:39 - 55:45)
you know we got like triangles we got (55:43 - 55:49)
like pentagons we got uh I don't know (55:45 - 55:53)
like an eight-sided star letters (55:49 - 55:53)
there's only three symbols in this world (55:54 - 56:01)
there's 26 that make up our alphabet you (55:58 - 56:03)
can combine them in multiple ways and (56:01 - 56:08)
they make worse it's like I don't okay (56:03 - 56:10)
I don't know why why are you sticking (56:08 - 56:13)
with symbols that you have to refer (56:10 - 56:14)
to (56:13 - 56:17)
as to a guide to understand (56:14 - 56:21)
I'm kind of happy with the non uh Roman (56:17 - 56:24)
alphabet Centric (56:21 - 56:26)
symbols (56:24 - 56:28)
making sure English is not the primary (56:26 - 56:29)
language here (56:28 - 56:32)
yeah they switch it up for languages (56:29 - 56:34)
anyway so (56:32 - 56:37)
switch off the (56:34 - 56:37)
wrists (56:37 - 56:39)
[Music] (56:37 - 56:41)
I think Japan has its own symbols yeah (56:39 - 56:42)
they have their okay Japan has their (56:41 - 56:44)
head Trend does all their own things (56:42 - 56:47)
Korea might have its own campus too I (56:44 - 56:48)
haven't looked at a Korean card in a (56:47 - 56:50)
while okay (56:48 - 56:52)
I mean also you're sort of like looking (56:50 - 56:55)
at symbols that will also mean different (56:52 - 56:57)
things in different cultures so you can (56:55 - 56:59)
be saying things with these symbols that (56:57 - 57:00)
are fine for your American girls or that (56:59 - 57:03)
are not fine for another culture like (57:00 - 57:04)
there's a lot of there's a lot of things (57:03 - 57:06)
that's you know like skeletons in China (57:04 - 57:09)
like you can't yeah make the symbol of (57:06 - 57:11)
school you can't have you can have (57:09 - 57:13)
animal skeletons but not human skeletons (57:11 - 57:15)
instead of being a circle for common it (57:13 - 57:18)
should be a skull to signify you wasted (57:15 - 57:22)
your money foreign (57:18 - 57:22)
will come back and it's coming back (57:25 - 57:31)
again it'll come back again uh (57:27 - 57:35)
it uh it opened with a turn zero Focus (57:31 - 57:37)
energy which (57:35 - 57:39)
boy I still don't think people actually (57:37 - 57:41)
understand how Critical Hits work but (57:39 - 57:42)
you know (57:41 - 57:44)
they'll figure it out eventually no uh (57:42 - 57:46)
maybe (57:44 - 57:49)
the only takeaway I have here for the (57:46 - 57:50)
Seven Star raids is they've all been (57:49 - 57:54)
very different and that's been good like (57:50 - 57:57)
it it shows that they can change when (57:54 - 58:00)
the shield activates how big the shield (57:57 - 58:03)
is how long the shield will last I'm (58:00 - 58:04)
sure we'll get a raid boss one day (58:03 - 58:07)
that'll have two Shields (58:04 - 58:09)
um Pikachu had a full shield (58:07 - 58:11)
um I think the the even though the (58:09 - 58:14)
Samurott I think had the smallest Shield (58:11 - 58:17)
out of all the boxes it's kind of tiny (58:14 - 58:18)
yeah (58:17 - 58:21)
um I believe the data miners pointed out (58:18 - 58:23)
that Samurott had more Health than the (58:21 - 58:25)
other boss not Pikachu Pikachu had like (58:23 - 58:28)
an insane amount of Health but (58:25 - 58:30)
um Samurai had more Health than deciduey (58:28 - 58:32)
Charizard (58:30 - 58:32)
um (58:35 - 58:39)
yeah so (58:36 - 58:39)
I thought it was fun I had I I had a (58:40 - 58:43)
good time (58:42 - 58:45)
um I was moving so I haven't gotten to (58:43 - 58:46)
do it yet but I heard a lot of people (58:45 - 58:48)
say it was hard and maybe the hardest (58:46 - 58:49)
one (58:48 - 58:53)
oh I I had I had nothing but Ease on (58:49 - 58:55)
this one (58:53 - 58:59)
I did I did one that had a Zuma roll a (58:55 - 59:02)
cried on and a cinder race (58:59 - 59:04)
and we beat it (59:02 - 59:06)
twice it's a wild world out there it's a (59:04 - 59:09)
wild wild world out there this is the (59:06 - 59:11)
The Raid conversation that happens every (59:09 - 59:14)
time ever since cinderaces you have (59:11 - 59:16)
half the people saying it was easy and (59:14 - 59:17)
half the people saying it was hard I (59:16 - 59:19)
mean your your mileage will vary (59:17 - 59:22)
depending on if the zoomeral standing (59:19 - 59:24)
next to you is level 100 or if it's (59:22 - 59:27)
level 72 so it's hard to determine (59:24 - 59:29)
player scale by the choices that they (59:27 - 59:30)
make because I thought when the (59:29 - 59:33)
cindery's locked in I'm like well I have (59:30 - 59:37)
no idea what we're doing at all but this (59:33 - 59:40)
should be fun and yet they put in the (59:37 - 59:43)
work I mean they were they were also a (59:40 - 59:47)
fighting type Terror type so I was like (59:43 - 59:49)
oh they have they're they're making (59:47 - 59:52)
they're getting mileage out of their (59:49 - 59:56)
raid boss thank God I get it go for it I (59:52 - 59:57)
mean you did why would you change your (59:56 - 60:00)
stereotype (59:57 - 60:00)
why would you change your stereotype he (60:00 - 60:06)
caught it clearly you did I mean clearly (60:02 - 60:08)
after the karate on (60:06 - 60:11)
murdered itself through flare blitzing (60:08 - 60:14)
and we're all just like yeah I still (60:11 - 60:16)
don't (60:14 - 60:16)
I I my chest hurts so bad because I (60:16 - 60:22)
locked into oh I was like let me do a (60:20 - 60:23)
random raid I love right now I need to (60:22 - 60:26)
know what people are playing and I I (60:23 - 60:28)
picked Salamence (60:26 - 60:30)
um and then who what was next to me I (60:28 - 60:32)
thought we had Tauros (60:30 - 60:36)
uh and then I don't remember what fire (60:32 - 60:37)
Taurus or a water Taurus it was the (60:36 - 60:40)
regular the fire Taurus (60:37 - 60:42)
and then we had another salamance and I (60:40 - 60:43)
was like ah (60:42 - 60:45)
this is probably doable (60:43 - 60:50)
and the the other salamance just their (60:45 - 60:52)
their single play the entire 10 minutes (60:50 - 60:56)
was just to fly oh (60:52 - 60:59)
tears because it can only be targeted (60:56 - 61:01)
half the time (60:59 - 61:04)
true good true good then that logic (61:01 - 61:06)
makes sense but like you are (61:04 - 61:09)
contributing to the problem you aren't (61:06 - 61:11)
contributing to the solution but you (61:09 - 61:12)
also aren't contributing the problem (61:11 - 61:16)
good solid they were contributing to the (61:12 - 61:19)
problem because we literally lost with (61:16 - 61:21)
like five HP (61:19 - 61:24)
the only thing I thought uh also the (61:21 - 61:26)
Taurus died like I didn't die the (61:24 - 61:28)
salivans didn't die whoever the other (61:26 - 61:29)
person was they didn't die either the (61:28 - 61:31)
Taurus just died five times (61:29 - 61:32)
um (61:31 - 61:36)
because it kept flare Bliss yeah (61:32 - 61:36)
the Tauros was the problem not the flyer (61:36 - 61:41)
because he was like I'm out you figured (61:39 - 61:43)
this yeah yeah I'm out I can't get here (61:41 - 61:46)
I'm out I'm not if the Taurus did (61:43 - 61:48)
nothing we would have won but also if (61:46 - 61:50)
the so do you think they were Choice (61:48 - 61:52)
banded (61:50 - 61:54)
the the Salamence yeah it does like have (61:52 - 61:56)
Flags I have locked into flying no no he (61:54 - 61:58)
did he did dragon claw once at the (61:56 - 62:00)
beginning and then realized that did no (61:58 - 62:05)
damage and then proceeded to just fly (62:00 - 62:06)
um I think he healed at one point too (62:05 - 62:08)
which is kind of a cool like so I was (62:06 - 62:10)
like oh somebody healed us uh but like (62:08 - 62:13)
can you do the cheer menu during the fly (62:10 - 62:17)
I do not believe you are you just locked (62:13 - 62:21)
out like I'm on autoplay (62:17 - 62:25)
so even like salamances salamance has a (62:21 - 62:27)
weird moveset but like fly fly is what (62:25 - 62:31)
like base base like 95 I think you know (62:27 - 62:32)
um (62:31 - 62:36)
fly is 90. so so fly is 90. so every two (62:32 - 62:39)
turns the salamance is doing 90 where if (62:36 - 62:41)
it just did wing attack (62:39 - 62:45)
it would be doing a hundred and twenty (62:41 - 62:46)
and it would be able to get to Tara (62:45 - 62:49)
faster he never teared (62:46 - 62:53)
um yeah but he could also be hit 50 more (62:49 - 62:55)
of the time but but you're not getting (62:53 - 62:59)
hit by anything super effective (62:55 - 63:03)
at all I don't want to get wounded my (62:59 - 63:06)
precious child could be in the air away (63:03 - 63:08)
from all of you low-level Ground (63:06 - 63:12)
Dwellers you know maybe he was just (63:08 - 63:15)
maybe maybe that player was like such a (63:12 - 63:18)
big Shelgon fan and was like all I want (63:15 - 63:21)
is my salamance to fly yes this is all (63:18 - 63:24)
Shelgon wants hey God's dream come true (63:21 - 63:27)
definitely possible (63:24 - 63:29)
um no the the samurai raids were really (63:27 - 63:31)
really fun I still I still love Seven (63:29 - 63:33)
Star raids uh I only got you know out of (63:31 - 63:36)
50 raids I only got stuck in a menu once (63:33 - 63:39)
that's (63:36 - 63:41)
that's actually kind of impressive (63:39 - 63:42)
that's (63:41 - 63:46)
a little bit yeah better better better (63:42 - 63:48)
stuck in a couple but I don't really (63:46 - 63:49)
remember because I was not paying (63:48 - 63:51)
attention a lot I was flying the entire (63:49 - 63:55)
time I was like Greg I'm into the sky I (63:51 - 63:57)
can't touch me (63:55 - 63:59)
uh I'm gonna bring something with dig (63:57 - 64:00)
next time (63:59 - 64:02)
yeah (64:00 - 64:06)
you want to give us uh you want to give (64:02 - 64:07)
us our uh (64:06 - 64:11)
yeah my bug update not not the Spy Ops (64:07 - 64:14)
update the other bug update yes so just (64:11 - 64:16)
because we've been talking about it a (64:14 - 64:18)
bunch here and there I mean a little bit (64:16 - 64:21)
in each episode the bug that has gotten (64:18 - 64:23)
people uh (64:21 - 64:25)
has made people unable to access their (64:23 - 64:29)
game data for scarlet and violet there (64:25 - 64:31)
are some players in Japan who have been (64:29 - 64:33)
contacted by Nintendo or the Pokemon (64:31 - 64:35)
company I think (64:33 - 64:37)
um asking them to send over their game (64:35 - 64:39)
data through a back (64:37 - 64:42)
kind of a hidden menu and then they fix (64:39 - 64:45)
it up and fix their game so we weren't (64:42 - 64:47)
really expecting these games to be able (64:45 - 64:49)
to be fixed but it sounds like some (64:47 - 64:50)
people in Japan have started getting (64:49 - 64:52)
their games fixed I know that there are (64:50 - 64:53)
some people in the US have also been (64:52 - 64:56)
contacted have also sent their game data (64:53 - 64:57)
over I don't think they've gotten it (64:56 - 65:00)
back yet but it sounds like they're (64:57 - 65:02)
starting to find at least individual (65:00 - 65:05)
fixes for these and hopefully that means (65:02 - 65:07)
that it will lead to a bug patch in the (65:05 - 65:09)
future that will just stop this from (65:07 - 65:11)
happening altogether but I am super (65:09 - 65:14)
super relieved to hear that people are (65:11 - 65:17)
starting to get their games back (65:14 - 65:17)
uh yeah Mr Mr Jose said uh there are (65:19 - 65:25)
reports that SV save bug are starting to (65:23 - 65:27)
get contacted by Nintendo and their (65:25 - 65:28)
saves are being restored through a (65:27 - 65:30)
process of uploading and fixing Japan (65:28 - 65:32)
only so far although I think it was just (65:30 - 65:34)
a day or two ago where (65:32 - 65:36)
uh America (65:34 - 65:39)
got a couple this was uh March 28th so (65:36 - 65:41)
this is a couple days ago (65:39 - 65:43)
um bug is still incredibly rare and (65:41 - 65:48)
we've been unable to replicate it (65:43 - 65:50)
the Wii in there is is kind of vague but (65:48 - 65:53)
yeah yeah because because Joe is also (65:50 - 65:54)
the same person that's like I'm the only (65:53 - 65:56)
one that works on Serebii but Joe does (65:54 - 65:58)
like the reason we know like raid boss (65:56 - 66:00)
Health (65:58 - 66:01)
um (66:00 - 66:05)
uh the the the drop right table all that (66:01 - 66:07)
stuff is because Joe does work with data (66:05 - 66:08)
miners (66:07 - 66:10)
um that will (66:08 - 66:12)
rip that data and then send it to him (66:10 - 66:15)
maybe at this point (66:12 - 66:17)
that he knows how to do it himself or (66:15 - 66:20)
they set him up with something but (66:17 - 66:22)
um throughout at least the sword and (66:20 - 66:24)
shield era we'd have to wait like 10-15 (66:22 - 66:27)
minutes after the event started for the (66:24 - 66:30)
the data miners to rip the loot pool (66:27 - 66:32)
tables and and all that stuff (66:30 - 66:36)
the shiny the shiny percentages yeah I (66:32 - 66:38)
mean who knows if if a Pokemon company (66:36 - 66:41)
game freak has found has been able to (66:38 - 66:43)
replicate the issue yet if they haven't (66:41 - 66:46)
pushed out a patch yet maybe not but (66:43 - 66:48)
they're starting to get things fixed (66:46 - 66:50)
which is the important part (66:48 - 66:52)
there (66:50 - 66:55)
yeah I I said something along the lines (66:52 - 66:58)
where (66:55 - 67:00)
there there's I I'm sure they're they're (66:58 - 67:02)
pulling some people just to make sure (67:00 - 67:05)
things are working but like yeah they're (67:02 - 67:06)
not there's no way a company is going to (67:05 - 67:08)
just keep contacting people over and (67:06 - 67:10)
over like they will it would make sense (67:08 - 67:11)
for them to push out a bigger update (67:10 - 67:14)
after they get the data being like okay (67:11 - 67:16)
we know for sure that this works we'll (67:14 - 67:18)
include it in one point (67:16 - 67:21)
the only thing is that I feel like they (67:18 - 67:23)
have to be able to isolate the issue and (67:21 - 67:25)
fix the issue with an update instead of (67:23 - 67:27)
having people send over their game data (67:25 - 67:29)
like they're doing now so I don't know (67:27 - 67:30)
yeah I don't think that's feasible for (67:29 - 67:34)
the long run yeah (67:30 - 67:34)
they're probably there's probably at (67:34 - 67:39)
least at least one person out there who (67:36 - 67:41)
doesn't have Twitter that has never used (67:39 - 67:43)
twitch never logged onto YouTube they (67:41 - 67:45)
lost their data I'm sure there was a kid (67:43 - 67:47)
out there who got their game data (67:45 - 67:49)
completely lost and just had no idea (67:47 - 67:52)
what to do other than just reset it if (67:49 - 67:54)
even that oh and I know what they did (67:52 - 67:57)
they went back to fortnite (67:54 - 67:59)
they're like well this game's done (67:57 - 68:03)
fortnite it is (67:59 - 68:03)
um yeah well there is supposed to be a (68:03 - 68:10)
planned update at the end of April (68:06 - 68:12)
um don't know what that includes don't (68:10 - 68:14)
know if it will include a permanent fix (68:12 - 68:18)
for the save bug thing again it is (68:14 - 68:23)
incredibly rare uh it's not (68:18 - 68:23)
it's it's (68:23 - 68:26)
there's a lot of there's a lot of copies (68:27 - 68:31)
out there and there are there are people (68:29 - 68:33)
that lost their data but (68:31 - 68:38)
the the ratio is is very dramatic (68:33 - 68:40)
and I I can't do math on the Fly I (68:38 - 68:43)
couldn't even do the Niantic math (68:40 - 68:45)
how much we're saving in that bundle (68:43 - 68:50)
pack like 60 cents I think 75 yeah 75. (68:45 - 68:50)
they have all the money we could be (68:51 - 68:55)
saving (68:52 - 68:57)
you'd be foolish not to take the three (68:55 - 68:58)
pack deal (68:57 - 69:00)
you're only uh okay (68:58 - 69:01)
um I think that's all the the news we (69:00 - 69:03)
have (69:01 - 69:05)
um yeah uh we do have a Nintendo switch (69:03 - 69:07)

those they always do when there's a new (70:29 - 70:34)
set but those do usually require like a (70:31 - 70:37)
15 purchase sometimes GameStop will give (70:34 - 70:38)
them to you for free because they just (70:37 - 70:41)
have so many and no one's buying stuff (70:38 - 70:43)
surprised no one's buying anything at (70:41 - 70:44)
GameStop (70:43 - 70:46)
um but if if you do want that (70:44 - 70:49)
collectible card usually you just have (70:46 - 70:51)
to spend like 15 bucks on something and (70:49 - 70:53)
then ask for it (70:51 - 70:56)
um you can try to get it for free but (70:53 - 70:58)
normally those are not free (70:56 - 71:00)
I don't know depends on how close you (70:58 - 71:05)
are with your local GameStop rep yeah (71:00 - 71:07)
I mean truth I'm like real humans they (71:05 - 71:09)
are they are human beings they just (71:07 - 71:10)
happen to work for just humans no they (71:09 - 71:12)
just happen to work for a terrible (71:10 - 71:13)
company (71:12 - 71:15)
I mean they work in retail like give (71:13 - 71:17)
them give them a yeah don't give my (71:15 - 71:19)
heart a break unless they give you a (71:17 - 71:21)
hard time I'll lie to you about needing (71:19 - 71:24)
to buy something for the little trunk so (71:21 - 71:26)
weird how sometimes nasty GameStop (71:24 - 71:29)
employees can be for like you work in (71:26 - 71:30)
retail (71:29 - 71:32)
like what are the worst jobs and you (71:30 - 71:35)
these people come in and are like awful (71:32 - 71:38)
to you like you have to know being awful (71:35 - 71:40)
back to customers ain't great like (71:38 - 71:43)
it's just a bad cycle I've never (71:40 - 71:46)
understood like when they are so like I (71:43 - 71:47)
get that they're awkward again why are (71:46 - 71:49)
you working retail if you can't talk to (71:47 - 71:52)
people like I don't understand why you (71:49 - 71:53)
decided to take this track (71:52 - 71:57)
yeah but there are a lot of real bad bad (71:53 - 71:59)
call-center jobs you can get without (71:57 - 72:03)
having to do face-to-face retail (71:59 - 72:05)
somebody who worked at GameStop as I've (72:03 - 72:07)
told you throughout this entire episode (72:05 - 72:09)
the places I've worked I would never (72:07 - 72:12)
recommend anyone working at GameStop (72:09 - 72:14)
you would probably make more money (72:12 - 72:16)
and have a better time working at (72:14 - 72:18)
McDonald's and I genuinely mean that and (72:16 - 72:19)
you would get free food working at (72:18 - 72:21)
McDonald's at GameStop they never took (72:19 - 72:23)
let me take a lunch break I was starving (72:21 - 72:25)
the entire time as I was resealing (72:23 - 72:29)
copies of Madden 201 did you have an (72:25 - 72:32)
eight-hour schedule no that they would (72:29 - 72:34)
give us uh they would give us six hours (72:32 - 72:36)
yeah so they wouldn't have to give you (72:34 - 72:37)
the lab right to give me a lunch break (72:36 - 72:38)
yeah (72:37 - 72:41)
and we were all in you know you were (72:38 - 72:43)
legally at least in Wisconsin legally (72:41 - 72:45)
required to have a 15-minute break when (72:43 - 72:47)
you work six hours but we were always (72:45 - 72:51)
too busy or there's not enough people (72:47 - 72:53)
here so how could you possibly take a 15 (72:51 - 72:55)
minute break you're the only one on the (72:53 - 72:56)
floor I had a retail job that didn't (72:55 - 72:58)
realize I said do you want to see how I (72:56 - 72:59)
do it I pulled the gate down and put a (72:58 - 73:02)
