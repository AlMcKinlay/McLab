[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 440th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host sbj with me is greg oh i'm living the life friends our pillow cubes came in finally my spine is in alignment wait you like them yeah well so it's been one night but i will say this since i'm i can only sleep on my slide this is the first time i woke up and my shoulder wasn't in pain interesting will here bed expert will hi i know very little about beds i took all my bed advice from you and started until you started telling me to get stuff from home goods and like literally alter the pillow i'm not gonna buy a pillow to stuff more or de-stuff i want my pillow completely made on delivery yeah get that pillow cube but what i'm really here to say is if you have not on the time that you are hearing this recording purchased your pokemon themed gift for your boo and or bae just get a card draw a pikachu in it and say i get you next year okay i'll get you next year and you can even spell it like g-e-t-c-h-u because that's like kind of a pun there you go oh my god i don't think i'm getting any pikachu or pokemon themed anything for christmas this year greg you bought yourself pokemon themed you you left no room for anyone to buy you pokemon all the quality pokemon merchants so nothing you got that fat pikachu ornament that okay original pikachu that those those pokemon ornaments were the ones that i bought in 1999 at target when it was time travelers need to buy christmas presents as well all right i mean the bigger question since i don't think my nieces and nephews will want them is upon my death who am i going to will them to the international pokemon archive oh yeah i'll send it to the museum ornaments are a real scam they're like 20 bucks what not when you buy them after christmas yeah but i feel like the stores have gotten really good at not stock overstocking ornaments let's get actually more accurate with your statement christmas is a real scam hey it's a lot of money for two weeks worth of i don't know what because i get nothing out of it you mean like two months wonderful time of the year it's in song yesterday i was riding my bike i sped out on some ice and hit my head on the pavement it's the most wonderful time of the year correct i was outside yesterday too we got a show we got a pokemon show for you guys today pikachu i said draw pikachu in that card yeah we started oh uh before we before we begin uh just a uh hopefully everything is fixed from uh the spotify issue that happened i think people don't understand how podcasting works i don't and i do it let's let's just talk about that real quick because the one thing that i am very very proud of is making sure the show is out every single monday morning it gets published at 6 00 a.m central time which is 4 00 a.m pacific 7 a.m eastern uh noon where somewhere in europe is every monday hasn't missed it in in over a year very consistent very proud of that you know if i was to walk out and get hit by a truck tomorrow i would i would reach for my phone i would call my wife i would tell her i would love her and then i would proceed to call will and i would say make sure the show gets up at 6am on monday and then i would die that's what would ideally happen if i was to get hit by a truck tomorrow that being said for those that don't understand how podcasts work podcasters do not submit their podcasts to spotify or to itunes or to google podcast or to stitcher uh like so when we finish the show on sunday i edit it and then i upload it to only one place and that is my podcast provider and we use a podcast provider called simplecast cost me like 30 a month to run it and then it turns the podcast into an rss feed which most people you're either of two kinds you you're you're uh old enough to understand and know what rss feeds are or you're young enough to never have heard of rss feeds because google kind of killed them like 10 years ago or like five years ago uh when they shut down google reader so i just upload the podcast to one place simplecast and then itunes stitcher spotify uh pandora every other podcast network we're on 200 different services they all automatically update that is it when i get a million tweets on monday last monday that it that i forgot to upload it to spotify no no no no no i did not forget to upload it to spotify i uploaded it to the one place 199 other different services updated so now you know and they didn't update theirs and i had to go through three support tickets to be like hey why didn't spotify update my podcast to the response of we don't know but we fixed it now okay thanks spotify i appreciate that thanks for taking 48 hours to fix it so if you are listening to this on your favorite podcast network spotify itunes google podcast stitcher pandora podcast overcast toddler whatever and for some reason the next week you don't get an episode we do have a website i know we don't really talk about it pokemonpodcast.com the seo is incredible on that [Laughter] pokemonpodcast.com you can go there directly to check where the episode is and it will be there uh the episode's always on the website as well and it will tell you uh other services but uh that was the first time in like a year spotify just didn't magically update so now i'm curious if it will update this week uh but yeah i don't know podcaster uploads directly to spotify you upload to a podcast service and then everything gets sucked up well it gets syndicated by really simple syndication syndicated is a real good word yeah syndication i guess i kind of lied i do have to manually upload it to youtube but that's because youtube is not a podcaster oh so the cracks in the story begin yeah i have to make an image for it because otherwise it would be just a black screen none of those images are you with your mouth hanging open and i'm pretty sure that's the number one yeah that's that's right be careful what you asked for because one week it might be you with your mouth hanging open okay there you are also on this program sir i'm just saying that brent's ipad hates me and the picture that because you know how you come swipe over and it says like hey look at this picture the one that always shows up on his ipad is me making the stupidest face and i keep saying why do you still have that picture it's like it just the ipad likes it just brings it up you know it's funny because like that feature of the ipad is very similar also to like facebook memories i think where it's like this is what you were doing 10 years literally whenever something comes up in facebook memories i'm like i need to delete that yep and that's also my reminder on the ipad of let me go ahead and go delete that photo of somebody i never ever want to see again in my life good thanks for the reminder there's plenty of video footage of me making really stupid faces out on the internet speaking of reminders pokemon cafe mix is a thing [Music] exciting holiday visitors are coming to the cafe that's right yeah horizontally holiday lucario and evie and shiny celebi and chansey and more in cafe mix from december 15th through the 29th holiday lucario who cares about shiny celebi when you have holiday lucario that's the ultimate rarest of pokemon holiday lucario will arrive a part of the team event work together with your teammates to serve loads of dishes to raise this festively dressed lucario satisfaction level during this event you will be able to purchase a holiday evie pack from the game shop this this bundle includes holiday evie who wears an outfit that matches lucara lucario's holiday look along with 13 400 golden acorns and a selection of items that will come very handy when completing puzzles log in between december 22nd to january 30th a pink shiny celebi will join your staff likewise by logging in any 5 or 10 days during this period you will earn a tasty tart item by logging in for 7 days you will earn seven thousand golden acorns it looks like square bunny will be returning on the 29th through january third sabo will be joining january third to the eighth and grooky the 12th through the sorry the 8th through the 12th you missed them the first time isn't it amazing how what a low effort holiday christmas is is like you slap a red and white hat on somebody and you're like i've got their holiday costume i mean lucario's wearing a cape bonus points i need to know hold on how much an acorn is in app purchases okay here we go oh oh interesting did you actually turn your phone sideways to do research for this segment no i just went to the app store and then i put and then i touched and then i typed in cafe mix and then i went down to the button that says in-app purchases okay so what did it say it said that it said that you can purchase a holiday ev pack in the game shop and it will come with thirteen thousand acorns yep thirteen thousand four hundred or what i'm looking at here in itunes or the app store i should say golden acorn pack 1200 is 99 cents and golden acorn pack 6100 is 4.99 oh i found the evie pack evie pack is 10.99 so 11 pokemon go players don't know how how good they have it you could pay 12 for an eevee in cafe mix or you could pay eight dollars for mr mime and pokemon go comparing the two that seems like a steal thirteen thousand four hundred golden acorns that's right yeah yeah which makes i guess makes sense because uh ten dollars would be two golden acorn packs of six thousand one hundred which is twelve thousand two hundred um so you're just paying an extra dollar there for you know a thousand more acorns plus the eevee i mean are you really going to freeze the items the real difference is that evie in cafe mix is not dex filler wherein mr mime yeah is useless hey you don't know if mr rhyme is good in like ultra cup or something i know nothing i uh the thing where when let me know when it's time for pokemon go complaints i just need to make this a story i have a couple i'm real mad right now uh we can because i don't know what just happened and i don't have a way of confirming i can't i can't stretch out cafe mix anymore i do want to honor our people who play cafe mix i'd be curious the the thing is pokemon go is so big you hear the complaints easier whereas like i feel like if i told somebody on paper you can pay 12 for an eevee and cafe mix or you can pay eight dollars for mr mime in pokemon go those people would either say one thing i don't play cafe mix option two would be like uh cafe mix sounds like more than a ripoff option three is maybe like somebody being like oh no that's it's totally worth it for evie and cafe mix i don't know i don't play cafe mix it's probably one of the three it's worth it it's a ripoff something of the sort but in pokemon go we i don't what are we complaining about will do you want to talk about the the mr mom event what's the issue well primarily the fact that i wanted i was and i went to both of your polls to vote for yes i am going to pay for the mr mime ticket and i went and i got a blank page and i closed and forced quit pokemon go and opened it up again and i went and i got a blank page and it's like i want to give you eight dollars can you please allow me to give you eight dollars for some crummy pokemon i don't really care about and i'm only doing this to prove all the haters wrong i still have not had any success but wait wait wait number two complaint because i'm sure we'll get back to mr mime i have several quests now or whatever they're called in pokemon go that say battle three team rocket grunts it doesn't i was like yeah it doesn't work for jesse and james not even justine james when you click on a balloon and it's like rocket leader lenora or whatever her name is she's she's no grunt either and it's like can i get a grunt in a balloon please because you can if you're getting if you're getting boss leaders um you can disable your rocket radar we've now gone a step beyond how so so when you when you have a rocket radar the game will say like do you want to equip it which by default most people probably say yes but if you go back into your item list where like your raid passes and your raspberries and your pokeballs are and you go back down to rocket radar and tap on it it will say like do you want to deactivate i'm doing this right now which is not super clear i think for the most part like activating the rocket radar is probably like the smart thing to do otherwise most people probably won't know it's probably smarter to force people to deactivate it than to activate it because otherwise people probably wouldn't know yeah it's it's not super clear as an understatement because also what i had understood what's happening with the rocket radar was that when i encountered lenora or whatever her name is that if i didn't defeat her the rocket radar sierra the lady with that with the drowsy but that like if i didn't defeat her that the next time i'd be able to get her again rather than some other rocket well you probably have a you probably have a surplus of rocket radars would be my guess so when you were defeating a rocket leader your next rocket radar would auto equip how rude [Laughter] yeah unequip done if you want to get to so niantic extended the meowth balloons for the shiny celebi event it was only supposed to be like three or four days of me off balloons and then there's the on on christmas there should be like all day me off balloons and i i don't have it in front of me of how long they extended it but i'm i'm curious because people complained that they weren't getting enough me off balloons after like 24 hours and people wanted to just grind out and get their their celebi as as quickly as possible when you get to i think it's like level 44 to 45 um you have to like defeat i think a hundred grunts or whatever but team rocket doesn't count so i'm like that's probably a very small part of the go audience team rocket only is grunts grunts are only team rockets oh i'm sorry jesse and james sorry jesse and james don't count okay so i'm i there's probably not that many people at level 44 we already know that there's not that many people at level 40. besides this is where my complaint comes in right now but i can't wait for those people to come start complaining that they can't find any grunts because they're getting nothing but jesse and james and jesse and james don't count for grunts therefore it makes it very hard to complete that part of the quest one final news update before greg's complaint uh i still cannot purchase a mr mine ticket i mean it ends in six hours and i personally don't think it's worth it but we can talk about the event um if i fine i mean you could buy if you could buy it you could you could probably complete it pretty easily in like two hours but but you don't have you can buy it and not complete it right away it stays in your inventory it's really easy to complete it's it's like catch 15 ice pokemon and then it's like spin a pokestop and then it's catch 15 psychic pokemon and then you're like done okay well hold on there we go we'll put it on i can't do any of it well as we're talking my suggestion would be delete the app and then re-download the app that's not going to happen but your account information is stored to a server not to this well then i've got to log back in again yeah what's the issue i don't remember my password are you logged in okay go into the settings scroll down and like this is not called check support pikachu account your apple id no they're not stealing my information heck no greg what you got an iphone they already have your information they don't no i have personal blockers on my phone uh this is more of a i have no idea what actually happened to complain okay because we know that i'm pretending that i'm grinding to 40 a thing that i've already given up on what you're like oh my god i gotta this is like pokemon go therapy one for will to spend money one for greg to get to 40. i just checked you're you're 60 the way there yeah i have you have 10 days that's not gonna happen and i'll tell you why this is this is this is my potential complaint so my pal cody and i sounds like an anime are coordinating yesterday 11 a.m pop a lucky egg to open the gift to hit ultra friends to get the max okay open the gift see the heart filling says friendship increased but i don't get a message which is common because my messages are often delayed by quite some time but the message finally comes in after my lucky egg is out and it says to me hey your ultra friends 50 000 xp i don't know which i got because it showed me the increase when the lucky egg was on but gave me the message when it was off so did i get 50 or did i get the hundred you only okay so the game the game can only do one thing at a time you can trick the game into doing things that you want in a certain order so for example if you were to this is really dumb of how the game works if you were to like open up let's say you were to get to four star friends with four people you go down the list you open four gifts and you get four star friends but then as soon as you get four star friends before the messages pop up you start you you start you catch like a century the game prioritizes catching and like your journal entry before it processes the like xp boost there it always tallies the xp stuff at the end that what that's why like if you go through and you open like five gifts in a row you'll see instead of it being like a hundred start us a hundred start us a hundred stardust you'll see it in the bottom corner being like a hundred now it's 200 now it's 300 because it's like adding it all together but it's not going to give you any of that until it's done processing it kind of does it like a calculator like it doesn't give you the final equation until you're like done it's done checking the entire list if you have a lucky egg on with like two minutes left and you get to like four star friends with two people and then um you catch like a pokemon and then the lucky egg is gone it does the processing at the end meaning that it's going to do the math and then it realizes the lucky egg isn't there so you're not going to get the bonus even though you match the friendship with the lucky egg the processing part of it happened when the lucky egg was gone therefore you don't get the bonus so the fact that i did nothing so we did it i did nothing for 30 minutes and it delayed not only did i waste a lucky egg but i did not get my xb boost yeah probably um you can this is why i'm done on this push to 40. this is my complaint because this is garbage like help their server being laggy when it shows me the thing was filling in and then 40 minutes later it sends me the message yeah you can you can use it to your advantage though because let's say one of your friends opens up four-star friends without you popping a lucky egg if you if you knew that was going to happen and you opened the app and you catched you you you go in and you catch a pokemon real quick and then and then as soon as you catch the pokemon you go into your inventory and pop the lucky egg you can use it to your advantage because again this game still has to calculate all that like catching a pokemon and then going into your inventory popping a lucky egg then it's it realizes the lucky egg is on and then it it processes to catch the pokemon then it processes your friendship so you can take like so if somebody opened a gif without like and texted you like oh hey we're forced our friends and you're like oh you didn't tell me how to pop a lucky egg you can quickly like catch a pokemon did like slightly delay it but it's always been like that i am so mad right now i cannot tell you how angry that makes me because i literally didn't do anything like i literally just sat there waiting for the message to come in and they don't come in until after the egg runs out i've i bought eggs mm-hmm i know it's super get to 40 and this this is why i'm done with this garbage push this is stupid so when i open gifts to get to like three star force our friends i make sure i do it at the start of the lucky egg and then i make sure i see the messages like the like oh you're for three star your first start then i start catching pokemon that's what i did and it still didn't work i'm so mad right now this game is garbage well i want i want my because i had two two of them came in two three stars one right after the other both at 50. well look three stars three stars are fine the real the real money makers are the four stars oh definitely but i i have four people lined up who aren't opening the gifts i sent them and aren't sending me gifts so already this is a whole garbage process i had to bug coal and then he opened again without telling me and pushed me over and i couldn't pop a lucky egg okay yeah that sounds like coal you are 2 million away i see you're right i'm not i am not getting 2 million in 10 days 1 million this garbage app is denying me my rightful xp well maybe if you did the mr mama ben greg you would have uh mr buy would have made it worse because i opened up my app to buy a ticket when it got in the blank and then it wasn't like guess what we're wiping out all your xp because you got a bike look at poor will standing over there wanting to take part in an event and he has actively denied his right to some ugly useless mr mime for eight dollars hey it's blue blue is my aesthetic black i mean that too and actually it's red is my aesthetic but whatever okay this game is so dumb i hate it i hate it so much right now i get 2 million in 10 days you get 2 million in 10 days greg can you imagine back when we were kids if there was a game and the the game that we had and we were playing it and it stopped working yeah and literally the solution was throw it away and just get another one get another one this is the 70s the 80s we would have had riots yep do some reggie steel raids you could get a shiny it gives good experience it does not give 2 million experience it doesn't it gives 20 000 though that's like so you know you do five you're at a hundred thousand so i would have to do a hundred reggie raids at a cost of sixty bucks to get an a ticket and i have seen people's avatars with the ugliest gyarados hat i have ever seen i'm waiting for the end of the story i'm wait i'm actually waiting for the new year's resolu the new year's miracle of greg being 40. it's gonna feel very satisfying on this podcast let me tell you look people need to get in line people need to do the things that i half the time i don't even know your name in the app because i have no idea who i have somebody who's like dj roop no clue who that is none we're ultra friends i don't know you i don't remember who you are because it's not a name i recognize i've looked through lists people whose names i know like my former boss stephen is like wild wild man seven like how does that tell me who you are i love wild man seven i i had a lot of people like when i posted my french co friend code on twitter and i just got a bunch of randos i did too and they don't send gifts either nor do they oh all of my ones from japan do you must have done it at the wrong time i did it at the wrong time so let's let's just talk about this there's not much to talk about for the gallery mr mime event uh a full disclosure here niantic did provide me with a free ticket i did not spend the eight dollars now we get to the trees oh it was a good event oh that's fine the price is fine because i'm getting it for free i i think the i think the event is bad um niantic thank you for the uh the tickets what i talked about last week or maybe the week before i don't remember specifically when we talked about mr mime but i have no problem paying for like an experience and with the this is the same price as the reggie genghis event it was the same price as the genesect event the genesect event happened over a weekend where i was actually busy and preoccupied so i did buy that ticket with my own money i understood that i would be able to do maybe one part of the first quest and then i would finish it at a later date so for me it wasn't like you know i didn't i didn't spend whatever the saturday or the sunday grinding out to get a genesect it took me like four months to get the genesect because i just missed it right the reggie giggs event on the other hand i like travel to like a chicago area to where a place with a lot of gyms because during the reggie giggs event they promoted reggie steele reggie rock and regis and i that was good like i really enjoyed that event this event is bad it it the quest line is is is kind of dull uh like the first part of it was um it was like catch 15 nice pokemon and the second part was like spin a pokestop and then the third part was no the first part was literally catch 15 ice pokemon get three curved throws and transfer 10 pokemon not that these events have to be hard but you're like okay well i did that and the second one's like spin a stop catch 10 of any pokemon and then like get three curved throws in a row or something and then the final quest is catch 15 psychic and then like two other pretty mundane things and then you're kind of done and if you didn't read the ticket close enough it mr mime does not spawn in the wild you get two mr mimes you get mr mind when you complete the quest the third part of the quest and then you get another mr mime when you complete the fourth part and then you get enough candy through rewards to evolve one of the two and if you're in like europe you probably could have you don't even need the candy because obviously regular mr mom candy works for glaring mr mime candy the story line is like you're you're ultimately you're paying like eight dollars for dad jokes because like the whole story line is is professor willow just being like there's tapping and there's music and there's ice and uh lo and behold mr mime so i overall i mean like some people are into dad jokes i guess and so for eight dollars it might be worth it to them but i said this again if if if you planned on using the items you're getting your value there i mean three super incubators is six bucks two lower modules is four dollars that's ten dollars right there if you really wanted the pose that's you know poses are normally five dollars so if you wanted all the items that's fine but i think overall having a two-day event weekend having your so you not only do you i think this is the problem you not only do you have to pay the 7.99 you have to then use incense which the event does technically give you they give you three incense i think at the start of the quest line but i think that's the one you have to do it's like transfer 10 pokemon to get three incense so you can get the three incense off the bat if you for whatever reason had eight dollars to spend but didn't have another dollar twenty to spend for incense you spend eight dollars and then you have to pop incense to like get the ice pokemon to appear and then that's kind of it but you would be popping incense anyways because like niantic said hey if you don't have a ticket if you pop incense you get the cup chews and the jinxes and the uh whatever other pokemon we're supposed to spawn spoinks well i just had a realization that i don't i don't have mr mime in my canto oh this would count that's so now all of a sudden it's extra i just deleted pokemon go because it's like i need to get a mr mine i'll pay eight dollars to get that in my pokedex yeah this i yeah this this this event was just very disappointing and it was kind of disappointing but it was disappointing on paper but it was even more disappointing in execution i don't know you should been able to pay like the eight dollars and just have i think the way they would have maybe been slightly able to fix it is you pay eight dollars and you have a permanent incense throughout the entire event like you gave me three with the purchase of a ticket but that only covers nine hours which some could argue is like more than enough time i mean you complete the event in like you complete the ven in an hour um the only thing that might be stopping you is if you're on your couch at some point you have to like walk to a poke stop spin it and then you can go back to your couch assuming you don't reach a pokestop from your couch you're like here's mr mime you only get two of them here's a two day event but the three incense we give you only cover nine hours of it and the spawns you're getting are the same spawns as the free event and you get you get like maybe like two minutes of dad jokes but all in all that just doesn't feel like an ex like that doesn't feel like an experience and cost aside whether this was a two dollar 10 15 i want an experience like if i'm going to go to a movie theater i'm paying for like the nice seat the good audio the big screen the smell of popcorn and then i walk out and i'm like man that movie like i want to see that movie again in the theater because of that experience versus that movie doesn't seem good enough or the experience isn't good enough to convince me to go to the movie theater so i'll wait for the netflix version you know what i mean am i is does that make any sense i just i'm i sort of lost it at you going to a movie theater but i'm suspending my disbelief to go with your metaphor yeah yeah yeah some movies are worth it in theater some movies are movies are worth it yeah yeah yeah most pokemon movies are not worth it in theaters no you know no no they are not and yet i keep doing it i keep trying i keep having that little spark of hope maybe this one will capture maybe the jungle one the secret is to go and see a pokemon movie in hawaii then it's worth it okay i mean i would worth it to go strip to hawaii yeah the mr mime event just very lackluster did you did you buy the ticket yeah did you yes and now since i had to reinstall pokemon go i have to go through all of the introductory everything all over again all right well let's take a quick break when we come back we got some more pokemon news [Music] we'll pay for the cow just bring the cow out [Music] [Music] now [Music] bringing out a cow we are back from our break let's talk about battle styles did you guys see the trailer i saw the trailer the trailer made me actually think about maybe playing the game when that cram got smacked like the garbage it is i was like this is the content i'm here for my problem is that trailer was very misleading because none of that actually happens in the trading card game and if it were to happen he would be disqualified it was a pretty hyped trailer though it was a good trailer i i briefly thought oh maybe this is when i get it nope i'm not getting any money for that yeah the trailer is really great if uh if you haven't seen it it's on the pokemon youtube it's just called battle styles it's a trailer for the trading card game it's pretty cool though they they show a lot of animated pokemon and a lot of if you like hershey foo you get your urshifu fan service the press release here says do you feel like taking down your opponent with a single powerful punch or seizing victory with a clever technical tactics that keep your opponent guessing you'll soon get the choice with the release of the pokemon tcg sword and shield battle styles expansion coming on march 19th the expansion will debut exciting new game play mechanics called battle styles introduce two different forms of attack single strike and rapid strike the former is the pokemon equivalent of throwing a knockout punch the latter is like a chess game of using tactical attacks to build a steady victory single strike cards are accented with red while rapid strikes are adorned in blue they're really stretching for their vocabulary here they got a thesaurus and they're not afraid to use it additionally but this is where we insert our grammarly ad additionally both trainers and cards are available in single strike and rapid strike to help trainers build decks around battle style of choice and there are two elite trainer boxes coming out battle styles expansion will also feature 60 battle style cards 12 pokemon v's 16 full art v's six pokemon v-max 19 trainer cards six full art supporters and two special energy right explain it all to me because i'm completely confused i ain't got no idea what's it what's a battle style card is that not a pokemon is it guys a supporter is it not an item what's going on sure is it really really easy to explain they've done this mechanic before so think of it kind of like e x and g x ultimately they're the same except that they can change the dialogue on the card to be like search in your deck for any gx pokemon right uh so then it it slowly eliminates like the usefulness of ex even though there's not a real big difference between the two it's just another thing they can write on the card so in this situation i think this is more comparable to what when the gym leader stuff came out a good example would be ability adds 20 plus damage to all of brock's pokemon so if you had like brock's sand slash or brock's onyx or brock's geodude if they were in play and then you had a pokemon that would add 20 damage to all brock's pokemon that's ultimately what this is doing so for example you could run like single strike hershey foo v max which has a g max one blow for three fighting energies one colorless energy for 270 damage and if you had mbor single strike on your bench emboars ability fighting fury stance your single strike pokemon attacks do 20 more damage to your opponent so just by having mbr on the bench g max one blow would do 290 instead of 270 because no one's gonna use that heap no one's gonna use that mbor to attack i can tell you that much mbor card is real not great that's pretty much the gist of it is this a game changer is this gonna get you both back into the game oh heck no no no no no no the mechanics of the pokemon trading card game consistently change and i like that every three months there's always new cards and because of that usually new decks or current decks get stronger or or keep having to pay in money every three months yeah to buy more singles and build a competitive meta deck okay sure uh but there's two problems one i can't play in person and two that my alternative which is the pokemon trading card game online is very bad so that's kind of the problem right now uh i mean like the pokemon trading card game is like fine for me there is there's really only one thing that would ever get me back into playing pokemon trading card game like i mean yeah i'll buy like a starter deck for fun and sit down and play with somebody and throw away all the cards when i'm done but i would need them if i was going to play competitive again i would need them to create i would i would call it and i know there's some issues with calling it this but whatever senior level and that would be only people who are like 30 years old and older because the attitude that you get from people who are 16 to 29 playing pokemon tcg is what drove me out of the game i'm like the opposite will when i sat across from from pokey dad i wanted to lose my mind like i would rather play against 16 year old edgelord who doesn't want to like talk the entire match then very over talkative very positive pokedad turns into very rude uh sore loser pokey dad once you start beating them you're right i'm not getting back into the game at all [Laughter] because all pokey dads go through that emotional uh turmoil through the match they always start off super friendly they're really chatty they gotta let you know that they're only here because of their kid and then as soon as they realize they're in a losing position they become extremely rude and they're the biggest sore loser ever yeah 100 of the time without fail every single one i don't know if this is the same in like magic but there are no pokey dads in magic magic dads i only play commander and i haven't played that in a year no it's different because of the whole concept right that let's put it in words that we can all palette or that are palatable for everyone that the pokemon tcg is an all ages game where people do not look at magic the gathering as an all ages game true so you don't have magic dads bringing i mean yes there are people who have been playing magic since inception or since for a very long part of their lives and like i want to bring my kids into this but the majority of magic players don't get to become parents [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] i mean so far judging by the group that i play in we're a zero for zero for kids you got that right so also some of those magic cards are scary yeah they got people's they're doing bad things to other people on those cards it is not family friendly uh some of the art on some of the cards there yes it said there are certain cars that i just won't play i know they're good but i'm like no i can't sit looking at this art so it will never happen ah the battle styles expansion comes out in english in march which is actually they normally do a set every three months but this is a four month gap but i think they're only pushing it an extra month is because they're coming out with those shining shining fates what are the hidden fates shining legends shining fates whatever it's called that comes out in february because of the anniversary [Music] professionals moving on to some more competitive stuff this was announced just a couple days ago the pokemon players cup 3 which is very exciting begins in january it's going to include both the tcg the vgc and their sneaking in pokken tournament dx so those the 30 people out there that love pokken tournament they can now rejoice pokemon players cup three online tournament is approaching it will take place january through april best trainers around the world will square off with prize and glories uh it's open to all masters division players and the entire tournament is online three separate competitions one featuring the pokemon trading card game one featuring pokemon sword and shield one featuring pokken tournament dx eligible competitors can earn their uh region qualifiers and participate on january 18th at 10 am the tcg players will also need to be logged in to tcg online between october 18th through january 18th to participate sword and shield players will have to lock in a spot for regionals it explains how to link and pokken tournament will compete within the region all players must register online before qualifying see details for that this is all pokemon.com so i'm sure i'm sure we'll get more details after christmas but for the vgc part of it i don't see why it wouldn't be series seven unless for some reason they messed this up again but it's been series seven for the last since november first december is also series seven january's plan for series seven i don't think we're supposed to get series eight until february but i don't know if that means like well i guess no no no because you could qualify yeah because for siri for players cup 2 you qualified using series five because that was the complaint but then you played in the qualifier using series seven series six was two months long but it took them that long to do all that stuff anyways it's cool that they're doing another player's cut i think it's uh i think it's proven pretty well to host these tournaments online okay final bit of news we have for the week is off my nintendo's my nintendo news.com tencent is looking for a pokemon consultant okay so this was tweeted by z huge ex which they they just cover a lot of industry news they're verified on twitter um but they come on what do you want from me i'm just reading their twitter names uh okay so this is what the tweet says tencent is recruiting for 19 pokemon related jobs one of them being called pokemon consultant the requirement is clear all pokemon games with 900 plus hours of playtime which i would say a lot of people are probably done oh yeah easy check known history of pokemon check if you did the first part second part is done having master ranking in pokemon what does that mean uh that's competitive yeah okay master ball ranking watched 500 plus episodes of the anime done ah i'm out done done done except for the master ball i can get that in a weekend how much does it pay i don't think it says well you know it's 10 cents so so 10 cents 10 cents an hour i don't i don't even know what like the average wage in china is i don't know uh it depends on the job like in america well the average the average household income in wisconsin is 60 000 which is probably really low compared to you know the coast uh depends on which part of the coast the average household income in south carolina is not that much yeah but also like milwaukee's minimum wage is 7.50 where in some places the minimum wage is 15. okay so average average i'm looking up a consultant in china uh i'm assuming that's yen chinese yen oh yeah maybe one it's 131 an hour so i don't know what that actually is in dollars annual per capita disposable income of urban households in china from blah blah 1990 to 2019. so we're looking in 2019 it is 42 359 yuan we'll say mr google how much is that in u.s dollars not australian dollars that is 51 783 wait that's euro oops uh according to consultant salary in china from economic research institute 131 an hour comes out to twenty dollars an hour in the united states so the average per capita urban household income blah blah qualifier this that and the other six thousand four hundred and seventy nine dollars per year i'm assuming they the the master ball ranking is they want somebody that understands competitive so just because you've played 900 plus hours of pokemon game just because you've watched a lot of anime that that that is important but pokemon unite is a competitive game it's a moba so i can't imagine somebody like there's probably some shiny hunters sitting out there being very excited that they have 900 hours and they love the anime and then they want to apply for this maybe not realizing that tencent is working on pokemon unite and then sit there and go well i don't know maybe they should attack you like they clearly want somebody who who understands like competitive um would be mine what about all the hours that i've poured into playing league and dota don't doesn't that count for anything i'm sure would yeah not according to that list no well i think the other probably thing that's not mentioned here is probably need to know what are what's china's spoken languages is it mandarin and cantonese is like written language it's not spoken right no mandarin and cantonese are the spoken languages and then they have different alphabets for writing yep oh okay so you probably have to know that not languages dialects are both chinese they're just different dialects got it yeah you know like the south is a different dialect there no that is not how it works i think it's cool that they're looking for like i think it's cool they're looking for a consultant i suppose the comments could just be as such why don't they talk to the pokemon company about things but i don't think any of these people have had a nine-to-five job because having somebody on staff is is pretty vital yeah like you still need you see like you can you can't email everything having somebody on staff who knows what they're talking about is invaluable so that when you send a big report to you know papa pokemon they're like okay redo your entire report because pages 10 through 20 are completely wrong and then get back to us thanks yeah none of this is weird uh it would be very similar to your company hiring its own accountant you could you could make the argument well there's millions of accountants we only need them for taxes why are we hiring them why don't we just hire one to come is that is that a statement you you actually believe what it's i think it's pretty vital for a company to have their own accountant on staff i meant we only need them for taxes look i worked at a real bad start up there there's a reason they went out of business accountants do a heck of a lot more than just taxes my friend well a pokemon consultant would probably do a whole lot more than just answering questions true i mean do you think it's just a person who sits in the office and then somebody runs in with like a picture and just says who's this how do you say it quick quick is this lucario or pikachu we are lost what does casco evolve into we don't know oh no how do you how do you know how do you know wait you're telling me not to put gormus into the game why [Laughter] yeah it's like the same thing for an accountant you walk in and you're like quick what was my tip on today's lunch i don't know i don't know quick what are my taxes and why did this make news because you made it new whatever you decided to make it news well i i'm assuming we're getting pokemon unite in 2021 uh yeah right after pokemon sleep yes well here's the difference tencent is hiring i don't know what [Laughter] push start i can't remember that company's name push start yeah they need a sleep consultant have you gotten 47 hours of sleep have you guys know somebody who is such a sleep expert that they literally have a t-shirt possibly they want it in a sleeping contest that says sleep i'm a big fan yes big fan i am that person is not me because i am really bad at sleeping i i pretty much fail at it every time level sleep i i can sleep anywhere anytime you say go to sleep i'm out i can do it i've trained for this consulting my entire life you need to own at least 30 pillows okay let's uh pokemon of the we're sorry question of the week uh oh we're doing this now what it's so early i'm out of news oh it's a it's a holy week only china's working right now we're using that news thought okay ready maca is the thing to say when you want the question of the week technically no that is not the thing you say when you want the question of the week and i wish you wouldn't confuse our for cakeys out there look nobody knows what that language is and nobody cares excuses how rude [Laughter] all right this week's question is from mark which trainers slash gym leaders netflix documentary would you be most interested in watching why does it have to be a netflix documentary why can't it just be a documentary i mean there's a documentary that they bought from somewhere else and then they just put netflix original in from it because they bought the rights but they had nothing to do with producing it oh isn't that 20 20 in a nutshell uh i think tobias would be pretty interesting i'd like to know how i guess a real character yes he's the one that beats ash with the darkrai and the latios but he's not a gym leader hey it's a gym leader slash trainer oh i would love to know how i won the sinnoh championship and how he caught his darkrai in latius and where he got his like dark magician cape from the anime is not canon thank you i feel like we already know the type of person that brings legendaries to a champion battle like we already know who that person is and we already know what a cosplayer is i don't think there's a lot of room for an interesting documentary there who have we never seen a lot of oh i know i did the bryson man documentary that dude's life all the films all the stages why he keeps showing up when you don't want him i'm all into that bryson man documentary for me i wonder because i i will admit i'm terrible at like the two things in pokemon that i'm terrible at that will keep me from getting that job at 10 cent is i can never remember the names of pokemon places like towns and anything and i never remember the names of like the gym leaders or or anything like that what a tough one you know i bet would actually have a very interesting life for a documentary it's opal yeah yeah opal has a lot i'm sure there's all like there's a whole lot you can cover with opal i think opal's documentary would be amazing who is oh there you go i was going to say who is the psychic gym leader from kalos olivia yeah olivia's got a lot going on olympia olympia olympia okay see i told you i can't you know whose documentaries i would not watch ramos silly and chilly and chris yeah would you oh so they wouldn't a documentary you see wouldn't be right for them but a tv show where they're running a restaurant yes i am those three cuties heck yeah i would watch master chef unova and those three would be the judges i would be into that i know i just want to see them running a restaurant with their monkeys and like all the hijinks that ensue elisa would have a good modeling one at least nessa would have a good one all the touring of the pokemon fashion world they could run project runway i feel like all modded modeling documentaries get real dark yeah real quick real dark real quick from hohen there were the two twins tayden elizabeth tate and eliza i wanna see uh where are they now yo yeah it's like they grew up and it's like what happened to them are they like the olsen twins did they fight start an uh pokemon fashion empire um let's talk about getting dark i think flannery's documentary would be very one note yeah she's very one note as a character she's just fire whitney whitney's would also be boring i did i did miss a very tiny uh bit of pokemon news here uh there is a diantha documentary there you go that's what we all want yeah that's what i want all right what was your boring news there is just a data mine that happened in pokemon go where there are um new hats on pikachu for uh new year's eve and new year's day just like little purple top hats um and then there's a holiday pikachu although i don't know keep in mind when we first saw the data mine for the stantler with the bells it took a whole year for that stantler to come forward so could be the case here there's a deli bird and a cub shoe with a bow there is a slow poke and a slow bro slow poke has 20 20 glasses on and the slowbro has 20 21 glasses on and then there's like the green sweater is gonna apparently be added to the store oh uh just a couple couple shirts and a couple hat pokemon no surprises there they might all show up maybe only some of them will show up just because things are data mined doesn't mean they're guaranteed so just a disclosure on that will give us our pokemon of the week well last week's pokemon was really complicated and confusing and that was on purpose there's a pokemon where it basically has three forms and it can evolve into two different pokemon one of those pokemon it can evolve into has two forms yes and then the third one is it's a different pokemon but it only has one form and i had something to say about korean beef in the middle of there yeah so who is that pokemon it's deli bird deli bird doesn't evolve in from anything i mean not yet not with that dude it's berserker perserker yes there is no shuffle icon now that's something this is too new i'm sorry but when did meowth become so incredibly confusing what look i've been saying for years that you guys everyone's complaining about charizard but meowth is the secret attention weapon that's what i said right there's only one pikachu form there are literally there's canto meowth there's a lowland meowth now there's glaring meowth and like the the the the the persian can be regular persian or it can be a lowland persian with the big garfield head and but then the glaring one can be a perserker meowth in the most episode of the animes besides pikachu miata is everywhere it's a meow economy on there how's that shiny does it have a shiny is there a shiny berserker it's gold i mean there is yeah it's the but also it's based off of hysterical stereotypical image of vikings yes i feel like i like if we had a pokemon league in minnesota berserker would be the mask i now that we have that available would agree because the football team is also the vikings yes all right this week's pokemon and as i have said frequently i will say again if you listen carefully this will not be as difficult as it seems all right i was in a pokemon trivia contest this past wednesday where there were people who were clearly cheating the contest was held over zoom i did not have a pokemon themed costume or stuffed animal and i forgot that a particular pokemon existed even though this pokemon has been around for almost 25 years i almost always completely blank on its name and i'm not talking about something like gum shoes remember all those memes this pokemon is clearly a standard bearer for the pokemon franchise in a number of media i think my main problem is that its two prior evolutions kind of follow a naming convention similar to gibbel and gabite but unlike garchomp this third pokemon takes its name from something else entirely it may be another case like gyarados where it was supposed to evolve from a different pokemon family the other problem is that its name refers to a story that is actually reflected by two other pokemon which with which it shares a type go let and go lurk in researching this week i also find it funny that it's shiny kind of looks like a nugget but it is not related to golden or gold duck there you go that's that's your clue for this week's pokemon uh will will be out of town next week for the holidays so it'll be greg and i and we'll we'll sneak somebody else on for sure we'll just because it's a holiday weekend doesn't mean there will not be an episode we will definitely be recording we will be doing twitch stuff all week so i like to stream i like to stream on twitch on holidays because uh being alone on the holiday really sucks and not a lot of people might be able to travel to see their family or friends so if you need something to do on christmas eve we'll be doing a short day stream and then i will be doing a longer uh evening stream on christmas day twitch.tv slash pkmncast so if you need something we'll be streaming all week uh my goal on christmas is to get magirna i have all the pokemon in place i'm missing seven pokemon and five of them are in pokemon bank getting ready to get moved up and the other two are kubfu and reggie drago so i'm just gonna catch those this week uh but i wanted my original form magirna to have the christmas day and it's a really dumb thing that i was like oh it'd be cool if i got it on christmas uh that'll that'll happen i will probably be doing some like battles this week i built a brand new competitive team in which you can if you're looking i always put my competitive teams to rent on the subreddit r super effective so if you're looking to get a competitive you want to rent some of the teams i built by hand you can go over there uh instagram youtube uh
