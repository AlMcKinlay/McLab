yeah get that pillow cube but what i'm (1:22 - 1:25)
really here to say (1:24 - 1:29)
is if you have not on the time that you (1:25 - 1:31)
are hearing this recording (1:29 - 1:33)
purchased your pokemon themed gift for (1:31 - 1:35)
your boo and or bae (1:33 - 1:38)

and say i get you next year (1:38 - 1:44)
okay i'll get you next year and you can (1:42 - 1:46)
even spell it like (1:44 - 1:48)
g-e-t-c-h-u because that's like (1:46 - 1:52)
kind of a pun there you go oh my god (1:48 - 1:55)
i don't think i'm getting any pikachu or (1:52 - 1:56)
pokemon themed (1:55 - 1:58)
anything for christmas this year greg (1:56 - 1:59)
you bought yourself (1:58 - 2:03)
pokemon themed you you left no room for (1:59 - 2:05)
anyone to buy you pokemon (2:03 - 2:09)
all the quality pokemon merchants (2:05 - 2:13)
so nothing (2:09 - 2:13)
you got that fat pikachu ornament that (2:13 - 2:20)
okay original pikachu that (2:17 - 2:22)
those those pokemon ornaments were the (2:20 - 2:23)
ones that i (2:22 - 2:27)
bought in 1999 at target (2:23 - 2:29)
when it was time travelers need to buy (2:27 - 2:31)
christmas presents as well (2:29 - 2:33)
all right i mean the bigger question (2:31 - 2:34)
since i don't think my nieces and (2:33 - 2:35)
nephews (2:34 - 2:38)
will want them is upon my death who am i (2:35 - 2:40)
going to will them to (2:38 - 2:42)
the international pokemon archive oh (2:40 - 2:44)
yeah i'll send it to the museum (2:42 - 2:46)
ornaments are a real scam they're like (2:44 - 2:47)
20 bucks what (2:46 - 2:50)
not when you buy them after christmas (2:47 - 2:51)
yeah but (2:50 - 2:53)
i feel like the stores have gotten (2:51 - 2:55)
really good at not stock overstocking (2:53 - 2:56)
ornaments (2:55 - 2:58)
let's get actually more accurate with (2:56 - 2:59)
your statement (2:58 - 3:03)
christmas is a real scam (2:59 - 3:06)
hey it's a lot of money for (3:03 - 3:08)
two weeks worth of i don't know what (3:06 - 3:10)
because i get nothing out of it you mean (3:08 - 3:12)
like two months (3:10 - 3:15)
wonderful time of the year it's in song (3:12 - 3:18)
yesterday i was riding my bike i sped (3:15 - 3:20)
out on some ice and hit my head on the (3:18 - 3:21)
pavement it's the most (3:20 - 3:23)
wonderful time of the year correct i was (3:21 - 3:25)
outside yesterday too (3:23 - 3:28)
we got a show we got a pokemon show for (3:25 - 3:30)
you guys today (3:28 - 3:32)
pikachu i said draw pikachu in that card (3:30 - 3:34)
yeah we started (3:32 - 3:37)
oh uh before we before we begin uh just (3:34 - 3:38)
a (3:37 - 3:41)
uh hopefully everything is fixed from (3:38 - 3:44)
uh the spotify issue that happened i (3:41 - 3:45)
think people don't understand how (3:44 - 3:49)
podcasting works i don't and i do it (3:45 - 3:51)
let's let's just talk about that real (3:49 - 3:52)
quick (3:51 - 3:54)
because the one thing that i am very (3:52 - 3:55)
very proud of (3:54 - 3:58)
is making sure the show is out every (3:55 - 4:00)
single monday morning (3:58 - 4:02)
it gets published at 6 00 a.m central (4:00 - 4:04)
time which is 4 00 a.m (4:02 - 4:08)
pacific 7 a.m eastern uh noon (4:04 - 4:10)
where somewhere in europe is every (4:08 - 4:12)
monday hasn't missed it in (4:10 - 4:14)
in over a year very consistent very (4:12 - 4:15)
proud of that (4:14 - 4:17)
you know if i was to walk out and get (4:15 - 4:19)
hit by a truck tomorrow (4:17 - 4:22)
i would i would reach for my phone i (4:19 - 4:23)
would call my wife i would tell her i (4:22 - 4:25)
would love her and then i would proceed (4:23 - 4:26)
to call will (4:25 - 4:28)
and i would say make sure the show gets (4:26 - 4:30)
up at 6am on monday (4:28 - 4:31)
and then i would die that's what would (4:30 - 4:34)
ideally happen if i was to get hit by a (4:31 - 4:34)
truck tomorrow (4:34 - 4:37)
that being said for those that don't (4:34 - 4:39)
understand how podcasts work (4:37 - 4:43)
podcasters do not submit their podcasts (4:39 - 4:46)
to spotify or to itunes or (4:43 - 4:49)
to google podcast or to stitcher (4:46 - 4:52)
uh like so when we finish the show on (4:49 - 4:54)
sunday i edit it (4:52 - 4:57)
and then i upload it to only one place (4:54 - 5:00)
and that is my podcast provider and we (4:57 - 5:03)
use a podcast provider called simplecast (5:00 - 5:05)
cost me like 30 a month to run it and (5:03 - 5:06)
then (5:05 - 5:09)
it turns the podcast into an rss feed (5:06 - 5:12)
which most people you're either of two (5:09 - 5:13)
kinds you (5:12 - 5:15)
you're you're uh old enough to (5:13 - 5:17)
understand and know what rss feeds are (5:15 - 5:19)
or you're young enough to never have (5:17 - 5:21)
heard of rss feeds because google kind (5:19 - 5:23)
of killed them like 10 years ago (5:21 - 5:25)
or like five years ago uh when they shut (5:23 - 5:26)
down google reader (5:25 - 5:28)
so i just upload the podcast to one (5:26 - 5:29)
place simplecast (5:28 - 5:33)
and then itunes stitcher spotify (5:29 - 5:36)
uh pandora every other podcast network (5:33 - 5:36)
we're on (5:36 - 5:40)
200 different services they all (5:36 - 5:42)
automatically update that is it when i (5:40 - 5:44)
get a million tweets (5:42 - 5:47)
on monday last monday that it that i (5:44 - 5:50)
forgot to upload it to spotify (5:47 - 5:53)
no no no no no i did not forget to (5:50 - 5:54)
upload it to spotify (5:53 - 5:58)
i uploaded it to the one place 199 (5:54 - 6:01)
other different services updated so (5:58 - 6:04)
now you know and they didn't update (6:01 - 6:06)
theirs and i had to go through three (6:04 - 6:08)
support tickets to be like hey (6:06 - 6:11)
why didn't spotify update my podcast to (6:08 - 6:13)
the response of (6:11 - 6:15)
we don't know but we fixed it now okay (6:13 - 6:18)
thanks spotify i appreciate that (6:15 - 6:21)
thanks for taking 48 hours to fix it so (6:18 - 6:23)
if you are listening to this on your (6:21 - 6:25)
favorite podcast network (6:23 - 6:28)
spotify itunes google podcast stitcher (6:25 - 6:30)
pandora (6:28 - 6:33)
podcast overcast toddler whatever (6:30 - 6:35)
and for some reason the next week you (6:33 - 6:37)
don't get an episode we do have a (6:35 - 6:39)
website i know we don't really talk (6:37 - 6:42)
about it pokemonpodcast.com the seo is (6:39 - 6:44)
incredible on that (6:42 - 6:46)
[Laughter] (6:44 - 6:48)
pokemonpodcast.com you can go there (6:46 - 6:52)
directly to check where the episode is (6:48 - 6:54)
and it will be there uh the episode's (6:52 - 6:55)
always on the website as well (6:54 - 6:58)
and it will tell you uh other services (6:55 - 7:01)
but uh that was the first time in like a (6:58 - 7:02)
year spotify just didn't magically (7:01 - 7:04)
update so now i'm curious if it will (7:02 - 7:06)
update this week (7:04 - 7:09)
uh but yeah i don't know podcaster (7:06 - 7:10)
uploads directly to (7:09 - 7:12)
spotify you upload to a podcast service (7:10 - 7:14)
and then everything gets sucked up (7:12 - 7:16)
well it gets syndicated by really simple (7:14 - 7:18)
syndication syndicated (7:16 - 7:20)
is a real good word yeah syndication i (7:18 - 7:22)
guess i kind of lied i do have to (7:20 - 7:24)
manually upload it to youtube (7:22 - 7:25)
but that's because youtube is not a (7:24 - 7:28)
podcaster (7:25 - 7:31)
oh so the cracks in the story begin (7:28 - 7:33)
yeah i have to make an image for it (7:31 - 7:34)
because otherwise it would be just a (7:33 - 7:36)
black screen (7:34 - 7:37)
none of those images are you with your (7:36 - 7:39)
mouth hanging open and i'm pretty sure (7:37 - 7:43)
that's the number one yeah that's that's (7:39 - 7:44)
right be careful what you asked for (7:43 - 7:46)
because one week it might be (7:44 - 7:49)
you with your mouth hanging open okay (7:46 - 7:50)
there (7:49 - 7:53)
you are also on this program sir i'm (7:50 - 7:54)
just saying (7:53 - 7:57)
that brent's ipad hates me and (7:54 - 7:59)
the picture that because you know how (7:57 - 8:01)
you come swipe over and it says like hey (7:59 - 8:02)

stupidest face and i keep saying why do (8:05 - 8:10)

brings it up (8:13 - 8:16)
you know it's funny because like that (8:14 - 8:18)
feature of the ipad (8:16 - 8:20)

the internet (8:42 - 8:47)
speaking of reminders (8:44 - 8:50)

first time (10:21 - 10:25)
isn't it amazing how what a low (10:22 - 10:28)
effort holiday christmas is is like you (10:25 - 10:30)
slap a red and white hat on somebody and (10:28 - 10:30)
you're like (10:30 - 10:33)
i've got their holiday costume (10:30 - 10:36)
i mean lucario's wearing a cape (10:33 - 10:40)
bonus points i need to know (10:36 - 10:44)
hold on how much an acorn is (10:40 - 10:47)
in app purchases okay here we go oh (10:44 - 10:50)
oh interesting did you actually turn (10:47 - 10:52)
your phone sideways to do research for (10:50 - 10:54)
this segment no i just went to the app (10:52 - 10:56)
store and then i put and then i touched (10:54 - 10:57)
and then i (10:56 - 10:58)
typed in cafe mix and then i went down (10:57 - 11:01)
to the button that says in-app purchases (10:58 - 11:06)
okay so what did it say it said that (11:01 - 11:06)
it said that you can purchase (11:07 - 11:13)
a holiday ev pack in the game shop and (11:10 - 11:14)
it will come with (11:13 - 11:18)
thirteen thousand acorns yep (11:14 - 11:20)
thirteen thousand four hundred or what (11:18 - 11:22)
i'm looking at here in itunes (11:20 - 11:24)
or the app store i should say golden (11:22 - 11:26)
acorn pack 1200 (11:24 - 11:30)
is 99 cents and golden acorn pack 6100 (11:26 - 11:31)
is 4.99 (11:30 - 11:34)
oh i found the evie pack evie pack is (11:31 - 11:35)
10.99 (11:34 - 11:40)
so 11 pokemon go players don't know how (11:35 - 11:43)
how good they have it you could pay 12 (11:40 - 11:44)
for an eevee (11:43 - 11:46)
in cafe mix or you could pay eight (11:44 - 11:49)
dollars for mr mime and pokemon go (11:46 - 11:51)
comparing the two that seems like a (11:49 - 11:53)
steal (11:51 - 11:54)
thirteen thousand four hundred golden (11:53 - 11:56)
acorns that's right yeah yeah which (11:54 - 11:56)
makes (11:56 - 11:59)
i guess makes sense because uh ten (11:56 - 12:00)
dollars would be (11:59 - 12:02)
two golden acorn packs of six thousand (12:00 - 12:04)
one hundred which is twelve thousand two (12:02 - 12:05)
hundred (12:04 - 12:06)
um so you're just paying an extra dollar (12:05 - 12:08)
there for you know a thousand more (12:06 - 12:09)
acorns plus (12:08 - 12:12)
the eevee i mean are you really going to (12:09 - 12:13)
freeze the items (12:12 - 12:17)
the real difference is that evie in cafe (12:13 - 12:17)
mix (12:17 - 12:21)
is not dex filler wherein mr mime (12:17 - 12:25)
yeah is useless hey you don't know if mr (12:21 - 12:28)
rhyme is good in like ultra cup or (12:25 - 12:30)
something (12:28 - 12:35)
i know nothing i uh (12:30 - 12:35)
the thing where when let me know when (12:35 - 12:39)
it's time for pokemon go complaints (12:37 - 12:41)
i just need to make this a story i have (12:39 - 12:43)
a couple i'm real mad right now (12:41 - 12:45)
uh we can because i don't know what just (12:43 - 12:47)
happened and i don't have a way of (12:45 - 12:47)
confirming (12:47 - 12:49)
i can't i can't stretch out cafe mix (12:47 - 12:51)
anymore i do want to honor our people (12:49 - 12:53)
who play cafe mix (12:51 - 12:56)
i'd be curious the the thing is pokemon (12:53 - 12:57)
go is so (12:56 - 13:01)
big you hear the complaints easier (12:57 - 13:03)
whereas like i feel like if i told (13:01 - 13:05)
somebody on paper you can pay 12 (13:03 - 13:07)
for an eevee and cafe mix or you can pay (13:05 - 13:10)
eight dollars for mr mime in pokemon go (13:07 - 13:12)
those people would either say one thing (13:10 - 13:13)
i don't play cafe mix (13:12 - 13:16)
option two would be like uh cafe mix (13:13 - 13:17)
sounds like more than a ripoff option (13:16 - 13:19)
three is maybe like somebody being like (13:17 - 13:20)
oh no that's (13:19 - 13:22)
it's totally worth it for evie and cafe (13:20 - 13:23)
mix i don't know (13:22 - 13:25)
i don't play cafe mix it's probably one (13:23 - 13:28)
of the three it's worth it it's a ripoff (13:25 - 13:31)
something of the sort but in pokemon go (13:28 - 13:33)
we i don't what are we complaining about (13:31 - 13:35)
will do you want to talk about the (13:33 - 13:39)
the mr mom event what's the issue well (13:35 - 13:43)
primarily the fact that i wanted i was (13:39 - 13:45)
and i went to both of your polls to vote (13:43 - 13:47)
for yes i am going to pay for the mr (13:45 - 13:48)
mime ticket (13:47 - 13:51)
and i went and i got a blank page (13:48 - 13:55)
and i closed and forced quit pokemon go (13:51 - 13:57)
and opened it up again and i went (13:55 - 14:01)
and i got a blank page and it's like (13:57 - 14:04)
i want to give you eight dollars (14:01 - 14:06)
can you please allow me to give you (14:04 - 14:08)
eight dollars (14:06 - 14:10)
for some crummy pokemon i don't really (14:08 - 14:11)
care about (14:10 - 14:13)
and i'm only doing this to prove all the (14:11 - 14:14)
haters wrong (14:13 - 14:16)
i still have not had any success but (14:14 - 14:18)
wait wait wait number two complaint (14:16 - 14:20)
because i'm sure we'll get back to mr (14:18 - 14:21)
mime (14:20 - 14:24)
i have several quests now or whatever (14:21 - 14:26)
they're called in pokemon go (14:24 - 14:30)
that say battle three team rocket grunts (14:26 - 14:30)
it doesn't (14:30 - 14:33)
i was like yeah it doesn't work for (14:30 - 14:34)
jesse and james (14:33 - 14:36)
not even justine james when you click on (14:34 - 14:39)
a balloon and it's like rocket leader (14:36 - 14:41)
lenora or whatever her name is she's (14:39 - 14:44)
she's no grunt either and it's like can (14:41 - 14:46)
i get a grunt in a balloon please (14:44 - 14:46)
because (14:46 - 14:47)
you can if you're getting if you're (14:46 - 14:50)
getting boss leaders um you can disable (14:47 - 14:52)
your rocket radar (14:50 - 14:57)
we've now gone a step beyond how so (14:52 - 14:57)
so when you when you have a rocket radar (14:59 - 15:03)
the game will say like do you want to (15:02 - 15:04)
equip it (15:03 - 15:05)
which by default most people probably (15:04 - 15:07)
say yes but if you go back into your (15:05 - 15:09)
item list where like your raid passes (15:07 - 15:10)
and your raspberries and your pokeballs (15:09 - 15:11)
are and you go back down to rocket radar (15:10 - 15:12)
and tap on (15:11 - 15:13)
it it will say like do you want to (15:12 - 15:16)
deactivate i'm doing this right now (15:13 - 15:19)
which is not super clear i think for the (15:16 - 15:20)
most part like activating the rocket (15:19 - 15:22)
radar is probably like the smart thing (15:20 - 15:22)
to do (15:22 - 15:24)
otherwise most people probably won't (15:22 - 15:25)
know it's probably (15:24 - 15:28)
smarter to force people to deactivate it (15:25 - 15:29)
than to activate it (15:28 - 15:30)
because otherwise people probably (15:29 - 15:33)
wouldn't know yeah it's it's not super (15:30 - 15:35)
clear as an understatement because (15:33 - 15:37)
also (15:35 - 15:37)
what i had understood what's happening (15:38 - 15:42)
with the rocket radar was that when i (15:40 - 15:42)
encountered (15:42 - 15:45)
lenora or whatever her name is that if i (15:42 - 15:47)
didn't defeat her the rocket radar (15:45 - 15:50)
sierra the lady with that (15:47 - 15:53)
with the drowsy but that like if i (15:50 - 15:55)
didn't defeat her that the next time i'd (15:53 - 15:56)
be able to get (15:55 - 15:59)
her again rather than some other rocket (15:56 - 16:01)
well you probably have a you probably (15:59 - 16:03)
have a surplus of rocket radars would be (16:01 - 16:03)
my guess (16:03 - 16:06)
so when you were defeating a rocket (16:03 - 16:08)
leader your next rocket radar would auto (16:06 - 16:08)
equip (16:08 - 16:10)
how rude (16:08 - 16:13)
[Laughter] (16:10 - 16:17)
yeah unequip done if you want to get to (16:13 - 16:21)
so niantic extended the meowth balloons (16:17 - 16:24)
for the shiny celebi event it was only (16:21 - 16:25)
supposed to be like three or four days (16:24 - 16:26)
of me off balloons and then (16:25 - 16:29)
there's the on on christmas there should (16:26 - 16:31)
be like all day me off balloons (16:29 - 16:32)
and i i don't have it in front of me of (16:31 - 16:34)
how long they extended it (16:32 - 16:37)
but i'm i'm curious because people (16:34 - 16:38)
complained (16:37 - 16:40)
that they weren't getting enough me off (16:38 - 16:43)
balloons after like 24 hours and people (16:40 - 16:44)
wanted to just grind out and get their (16:43 - 16:47)
their celebi as as quickly as possible (16:44 - 16:48)
when you get to i think it's like (16:47 - 16:52)
level 44 (16:48 - 16:55)
to 45 um you have to like defeat (16:52 - 16:58)
i think a hundred grunts or whatever (16:55 - 17:01)
but team rocket doesn't count so i'm (16:58 - 17:02)
like (17:01 - 17:03)
that's probably a very small part of the (17:02 - 17:05)
go audience (17:03 - 17:07)
team rocket only is grunts grunts are (17:05 - 17:09)
only team rockets oh i'm sorry (17:07 - 17:10)
jesse and james sorry jesse and james (17:09 - 17:12)
don't count okay so i'm (17:10 - 17:14)
i there's probably not that many people (17:12 - 17:16)
at level 44 we already know that there's (17:14 - 17:18)
not that many people at level 40. (17:16 - 17:19)
besides this is where my complaint comes (17:18 - 17:22)
in right now but i can't wait for those (17:19 - 17:24)
people to come start complaining that (17:22 - 17:25)
they can't find any grunts because (17:24 - 17:26)
they're getting nothing but jesse and (17:25 - 17:28)
james and jesse and james don't count (17:26 - 17:28)
for (17:28 - 17:31)
grunts therefore it makes it very hard (17:28 - 17:32)
to complete that (17:31 - 17:35)
part of the quest one final news update (17:32 - 17:36)
before greg's complaint (17:35 - 17:40)
uh i still cannot purchase a mr mine (17:36 - 17:41)
ticket (17:40 - 17:44)
i mean it ends in six hours and i (17:41 - 17:46)
personally don't think it's worth it but (17:44 - 17:48)
we can talk about the event (17:46 - 17:51)
um if i fine (17:48 - 17:54)
i mean you could buy if you could buy it (17:51 - 17:54)
you could (17:54 - 17:56)
you could probably complete it pretty (17:54 - 17:57)
easily in like (17:56 - 18:00)
two hours but but you don't have you can (17:57 - 18:02)
buy it and not complete it right away (18:00 - 18:04)
it stays in your inventory it's really (18:02 - 18:06)
easy to complete (18:04 - 18:09)
it's it's like catch 15 ice pokemon (18:06 - 18:11)
and then it's like spin a pokestop and (18:09 - 18:13)
then it's catch 15 psychic pokemon and (18:11 - 18:14)
then you're like done (18:13 - 18:15)
okay well hold on there we go we'll put (18:14 - 18:18)
it on i can't do any of it well (18:15 - 18:20)
as we're talking my suggestion would be (18:18 - 18:22)
delete the app and then re-download the (18:20 - 18:22)
app (18:22 - 18:24)
that's not going to happen but your (18:22 - 18:27)
account information is stored to a (18:24 - 18:29)
server not to this well then i've got to (18:27 - 18:31)
log back in again yeah what's the issue (18:29 - 18:33)
i don't remember my password are you (18:31 - 18:36)
logged in okay go into the settings (18:33 - 18:39)
scroll down and like this is not called (18:36 - 18:42)
check support pikachu account (18:39 - 18:45)
your apple id no they're not stealing my (18:42 - 18:46)
information heck no (18:45 - 18:49)
greg what you got an iphone they already (18:46 - 18:51)
have your information (18:49 - 18:53)
they don't no i have personal blockers (18:51 - 18:54)
on my phone (18:53 - 18:57)
uh this is more of a i have no idea what (18:54 - 18:59)
actually happened to complain (18:57 - 19:01)
okay because we know that i'm pretending (18:59 - 19:02)
that i'm grinding to 40 a thing that (19:01 - 19:04)
i've already given up on (19:02 - 19:06)
what you're like oh my god i gotta this (19:04 - 19:08)
is like pokemon go therapy (19:06 - 19:11)
one for will to spend money one for greg (19:08 - 19:14)
to get to 40. i just checked (19:11 - 19:17)
you're you're 60 the way there yeah (19:14 - 19:20)
i have you have 10 days (19:17 - 19:22)
that's not gonna happen and i'll tell (19:20 - 19:24)
you why this is this is this is my (19:22 - 19:27)
potential complaint so my pal cody (19:24 - 19:30)
and i sounds like an anime are (19:27 - 19:33)
coordinating yesterday 11 a.m pop a (19:30 - 19:35)
lucky egg (19:33 - 19:37)
to open the gift to hit ultra friends to (19:35 - 19:38)
get the max (19:37 - 19:42)
okay open the gift see the (19:38 - 19:45)
heart filling says friendship increased (19:42 - 19:47)
but i don't get a message which is (19:45 - 19:48)
common (19:47 - 19:51)
because my messages are often delayed by (19:48 - 19:52)
quite some time (19:51 - 19:56)
but the message finally comes in (19:52 - 19:59)
after my lucky egg is out and it says to (19:56 - 20:00)
me (19:59 - 20:03)
hey your ultra friends 50 000 (20:00 - 20:06)
xp i don't know which i got (20:03 - 20:09)
because it showed me the increase when (20:06 - 20:10)
the lucky egg was on (20:09 - 20:13)
but gave me the message when it was off (20:10 - 20:15)
so did i get 50 (20:13 - 20:18)
or did i get the hundred you only (20:15 - 20:21)
okay so the game the game can only do (20:18 - 20:22)
one thing at a time (20:21 - 20:25)
you can trick the game into doing things (20:22 - 20:27)
that you want in a certain order so for (20:25 - 20:29)
example if you were to (20:27 - 20:30)
this is really dumb of how the game (20:29 - 20:32)
works if you were to like (20:30 - 20:34)
open up let's say you were to get to (20:32 - 20:36)
four star friends with four people you (20:34 - 20:38)
go down the list you open four gifts (20:36 - 20:39)
and you get four star friends but then (20:38 - 20:41)
as soon as you get four star friends (20:39 - 20:43)
before the messages pop up you start (20:41 - 20:45)
you you start you catch like a century (20:43 - 20:46)
the game (20:45 - 20:49)
prioritizes catching and like your (20:46 - 20:49)
journal entry (20:49 - 20:53)
before it processes the (20:49 - 20:56)
like xp boost there it always tallies (20:53 - 20:58)
the xp stuff at the end (20:56 - 21:00)
that what that's why like if you go (20:58 - 21:01)
through and you (21:00 - 21:04)
open like five gifts in a row you'll see (21:01 - 21:05)
instead of it being like a hundred start (21:04 - 21:07)
us a hundred start us a hundred stardust (21:05 - 21:08)
you'll see it in the bottom corner being (21:07 - 21:11)
like a hundred now it's 200 now it's 300 (21:08 - 21:12)
because it's like adding it all together (21:11 - 21:14)
but it's not going to give you any of (21:12 - 21:14)
that (21:14 - 21:16)
until it's done processing it kind of (21:14 - 21:17)
does it like a calculator like it (21:16 - 21:18)
doesn't give you the final equation (21:17 - 21:19)
until you're like (21:18 - 21:22)
done it's done checking the entire list (21:19 - 21:23)
if (21:22 - 21:25)
you have a lucky egg on with like two (21:23 - 21:27)
minutes left and you get to like four (21:25 - 21:28)
star friends with two people (21:27 - 21:30)
and then um you catch like a pokemon and (21:28 - 21:32)
then the lucky egg is gone (21:30 - 21:34)
it does the processing at the end (21:32 - 21:36)
meaning that it's going to do the math (21:34 - 21:38)
and then it realizes the lucky egg isn't (21:36 - 21:39)
there so you're not going to get the (21:38 - 21:39)
bonus (21:39 - 21:42)
even though you match the friendship (21:39 - 21:44)
with the lucky egg the processing (21:42 - 21:46)
part of it happened when the lucky egg (21:44 - 21:48)
was gone therefore you don't get the (21:46 - 21:48)
bonus (21:48 - 21:51)
so the fact that i did nothing so we did (21:48 - 21:52)
it (21:51 - 21:55)
i did nothing for 30 minutes and it (21:52 - 21:56)
delayed (21:55 - 21:59)
not only did i waste a lucky egg but i (21:56 - 22:02)
did not get my xb boost yeah probably (21:59 - 22:05)
um you can this is why i'm done on this (22:02 - 22:06)
push to 40. (22:05 - 22:07)
this is my complaint because this is (22:06 - 22:10)
garbage like help their server being (22:07 - 22:12)
laggy when it shows me the thing was (22:10 - 22:13)
filling in (22:12 - 22:15)
and then 40 minutes later it sends me (22:13 - 22:17)
the message (22:15 - 22:19)
yeah you can you can use it to your (22:17 - 22:21)
advantage though because let's say one (22:19 - 22:21)
of your friends (22:21 - 22:24)
opens up four-star friends without you (22:21 - 22:26)
popping a lucky egg (22:24 - 22:27)
if you if you knew that was going to (22:26 - 22:29)
happen and you opened the app and you (22:27 - 22:29)
catched (22:29 - 22:31)
you you you go in and you catch a (22:29 - 22:33)
pokemon real quick and then (22:31 - 22:34)
and then as soon as you catch the (22:33 - 22:36)
pokemon you go into your inventory and (22:34 - 22:38)
pop the lucky egg you can use it to your (22:36 - 22:39)
advantage because again this game (22:38 - 22:42)
still has to calculate all that like (22:39 - 22:43)
catching a pokemon and then going into (22:42 - 22:44)
your inventory popping a lucky egg (22:43 - 22:47)
then it's it realizes the lucky egg is (22:44 - 22:47)
on (22:47 - 22:49)
and then it it processes to catch the (22:47 - 22:51)
pokemon then it processes your (22:49 - 22:52)
friendship (22:51 - 22:55)
so you can take like so if somebody (22:52 - 22:56)
opened a gif without (22:55 - 22:58)
like and texted you like oh hey we're (22:56 - 22:59)
forced our friends and you're like oh (22:58 - 23:00)
you didn't tell me how to pop a lucky (22:59 - 23:02)
egg you can quickly like (23:00 - 23:04)
catch a pokemon did like slightly delay (23:02 - 23:06)
it but it's always been like that (23:04 - 23:10)
i am so mad right now i cannot tell you (23:06 - 23:12)
how angry that makes me because i (23:10 - 23:14)
literally didn't do anything (23:12 - 23:17)
like i literally just sat there waiting (23:14 - 23:18)
for the message to come in (23:17 - 23:21)
and they don't come in until after (23:18 - 23:25)
the egg runs out i've i bought eggs (23:21 - 23:28)
mm-hmm i know it's super get to 40 (23:25 - 23:30)
and this this is why i'm done with this (23:28 - 23:32)
garbage push (23:30 - 23:35)
this is stupid so when i open (23:32 - 23:37)
gifts to get to like three star force (23:35 - 23:39)
our friends i make sure i do it at the (23:37 - 23:40)
start of the lucky egg and then i make (23:39 - 23:43)
sure i see the messages (23:40 - 23:44)
like the like oh you're for three star (23:43 - 23:46)
your first start then (23:44 - 23:49)
i start catching pokemon that's what i (23:46 - 23:52)
did and it still didn't work (23:49 - 23:54)
i'm so mad right now this game is (23:52 - 23:55)
garbage (23:54 - 23:59)
well i want i want my because i had two (23:55 - 24:01)
two of them came in two three stars one (23:59 - 24:03)
right after the other (24:01 - 24:06)
both at 50. well look three stars three (24:03 - 24:07)
stars are (24:06 - 24:09)
fine the real the real money makers are (24:07 - 24:10)
the four stars (24:09 - 24:13)
oh definitely but i i have four people (24:10 - 24:14)
lined up who (24:13 - 24:17)
aren't opening the gifts i sent them and (24:14 - 24:19)
aren't sending me gifts (24:17 - 24:20)
so already this is a whole garbage (24:19 - 24:22)
process i had to bug (24:20 - 24:24)
coal and then he opened again without (24:22 - 24:26)
telling me and pushed me over and i (24:24 - 24:27)
couldn't pop a lucky egg (24:26 - 24:31)
okay yeah that sounds like coal you are (24:27 - 24:33)
2 million away i see you're right i'm (24:31 - 24:34)
not (24:33 - 24:38)
i am not getting 2 million in 10 days (24:34 - 24:42)
1 million this garbage app is denying me (24:38 - 24:45)
my rightful xp well maybe if you did the (24:42 - 24:47)
mr mama ben greg (24:45 - 24:49)
you would have uh mr buy would have made (24:47 - 24:50)
it worse (24:49 - 24:52)
because i opened up my app to buy a (24:50 - 24:53)
ticket when it got in the blank and then (24:52 - 24:55)
it wasn't like guess what we're wiping (24:53 - 24:56)
out all your xp because you got a bike (24:55 - 24:59)
look at poor will standing over there (24:56 - 25:00)
wanting to take part (24:59 - 25:04)
in an event and he has actively denied (25:00 - 25:07)
his right to some ugly useless mr mime (25:04 - 25:10)
for eight dollars hey it's blue blue is (25:07 - 25:12)
my aesthetic (25:10 - 25:15)
black i mean that too and actually (25:12 - 25:18)
it's red is my aesthetic but whatever (25:15 - 25:19)
okay (25:18 - 25:21)
this game is so dumb i hate it i hate it (25:19 - 25:22)
so much right now (25:21 - 25:25)
i get 2 million in 10 days you get 2 (25:22 - 25:26)
million in 10 days (25:25 - 25:28)
greg can you imagine back when we were (25:26 - 25:29)
kids (25:28 - 25:32)
if there was a game and the the game (25:29 - 25:32)
that we had (25:32 - 25:34)
and we were playing it and it stopped (25:32 - 25:37)
working yeah and literally the solution (25:34 - 25:37)
was (25:37 - 25:40)
throw it away and just get another one (25:37 - 25:41)
get another one (25:40 - 25:44)
this is the 70s the 80s we would have (25:41 - 25:45)
had riots (25:44 - 25:48)
yep do some reggie steel raids you could (25:45 - 25:51)
get a shiny it gives good experience (25:48 - 25:53)
it does not give 2 million experience it (25:51 - 25:54)
doesn't it gives 20 (25:53 - 25:58)
000 though that's like so you know you (25:54 - 25:58)
do (25:58 - 26:01)
five you're at a hundred thousand so i (25:58 - 26:02)
would have to do (26:01 - 26:06)
a hundred reggie raids (26:02 - 26:10)
at a cost of sixty bucks (26:06 - 26:13)
to get an a ticket and i have seen (26:10 - 26:14)

satisfying on this podcast (26:27 - 26:31)
let me tell you look people need to get (26:28 - 26:32)
in line (26:31 - 26:34)
people need to do the things that i half (26:32 - 26:35)
the time (26:34 - 26:38)
i don't even know your name in the app (26:35 - 26:39)
because (26:38 - 26:41)
i have no idea who i have somebody who's (26:39 - 26:42)
like dj roop (26:41 - 26:46)
no clue who that is none we're (26:42 - 26:48)
ultra friends i don't know you i don't (26:46 - 26:49)
remember who you are because it's not a (26:48 - 26:51)
name i recognize i've looked through (26:49 - 26:52)

wild wild man seven like how does that (26:58 - 27:04)
tell me who you are (27:02 - 27:06)
i love wild man seven i i had a lot of (27:04 - 27:08)
people like when i posted my (27:06 - 27:12)
french co friend code on twitter (27:08 - 27:14)
and i just got a bunch of randos i did (27:12 - 27:16)
too and they don't send gifts either (27:14 - 27:18)
nor do they oh all of my ones from japan (27:16 - 27:20)
do (27:18 - 27:21)
you must have done it at the wrong time (27:20 - 27:23)
i did it at the wrong time so let's (27:21 - 27:25)
let's just talk about this there's not (27:23 - 27:26)
much to talk about for the gallery mr (27:25 - 27:29)
mime event uh a full disclosure here (27:26 - 27:31)
niantic did provide me with a free (27:29 - 27:33)
ticket i did not spend the eight dollars (27:31 - 27:36)
now we get to the trees oh it was a good (27:33 - 27:37)
event (27:36 - 27:39)
oh that's fine the price is fine because (27:37 - 27:41)
i'm getting it for free (27:39 - 27:43)
i i think the i think the event is bad (27:41 - 27:45)
um (27:43 - 27:45)
niantic thank you for the uh the tickets (27:46 - 27:50)
what i talked about last week or maybe (27:49 - 27:51)
the week before i don't remember (27:50 - 27:53)
specifically when we talked about mr (27:51 - 27:53)
mime (27:53 - 27:57)
but i have no problem paying for (27:53 - 28:00)
like an experience and with the this is (27:57 - 28:02)
the same price as the reggie genghis (28:00 - 28:03)
event it was the same price as the (28:02 - 28:04)
genesect event (28:03 - 28:07)
the genesect event happened over a (28:04 - 28:09)
weekend where i was actually busy and (28:07 - 28:10)
preoccupied (28:09 - 28:12)
so i did buy that ticket with my own (28:10 - 28:14)
money i understood that i would be able (28:12 - 28:16)
to do maybe one part of the first quest (28:14 - 28:17)
and then i would finish it at a later (28:16 - 28:18)
date (28:17 - 28:20)
so for me it wasn't like you know i (28:18 - 28:22)
didn't i didn't spend whatever the (28:20 - 28:23)
saturday or the sunday grinding out to (28:22 - 28:25)
get a genesect it took me like four (28:23 - 28:26)
months to get the genesect because (28:25 - 28:28)
i just missed it right the reggie giggs (28:26 - 28:30)
event on the other hand i like travel to (28:28 - 28:32)
like a chicago area to where a place (28:30 - 28:33)
with a lot of gyms because during the (28:32 - 28:35)
reggie giggs event they (28:33 - 28:39)
promoted reggie steele reggie (28:35 - 28:42)
rock and regis and i (28:39 - 28:44)
that was good like i really enjoyed that (28:42 - 28:46)
event this event is bad (28:44 - 28:49)
it it the quest line is is is kind of (28:46 - 28:50)
dull (28:49 - 28:53)
uh like the first part of it was um it (28:50 - 28:55)
was like catch 15 nice pokemon (28:53 - 28:56)
and the second part was like spin a (28:55 - 28:59)
pokestop and then the third part was (28:56 - 29:01)
no the first part was literally catch 15 (28:59 - 29:04)
ice pokemon get three curved throws and (29:01 - 29:06)
transfer 10 pokemon not that these (29:04 - 29:07)
events have to be hard but you're like (29:06 - 29:09)
okay well i did that (29:07 - 29:11)
and the second one's like spin a stop (29:09 - 29:14)
catch 10 of any pokemon and then like (29:11 - 29:16)
get three curved throws in a row or (29:14 - 29:18)
something and then the final quest (29:16 - 29:21)
is catch 15 psychic (29:18 - 29:23)
and then like two other pretty mundane (29:21 - 29:25)
things and then you're kind of done (29:23 - 29:26)
and if you didn't read the ticket close (29:25 - 29:28)
enough it mr mime does not spawn in the (29:26 - 29:29)
wild (29:28 - 29:32)
you get two mr mimes you get mr mind (29:29 - 29:33)
when you complete the quest (29:32 - 29:35)
the third part of the quest and then you (29:33 - 29:36)
get another mr mime when you complete (29:35 - 29:37)
the fourth part (29:36 - 29:40)
and then you get enough candy through (29:37 - 29:41)
rewards to evolve (29:40 - 29:43)
one of the two and if you're in like (29:41 - 29:45)
europe you probably could have you don't (29:43 - 29:46)
even need the candy because (29:45 - 29:48)
obviously regular mr mom candy works for (29:46 - 29:49)
glaring mr mime candy (29:48 - 29:51)
the story line is like you're you're (29:49 - 29:53)
ultimately you're paying like eight (29:51 - 29:54)
dollars for dad jokes (29:53 - 29:57)
because like the whole story line is is (29:54 - 30:00)
professor willow just being like there's (29:57 - 30:02)
tapping and there's (30:00 - 30:04)
music and there's ice and uh lo and (30:02 - 30:06)
behold mr mime (30:04 - 30:09)
so i overall i mean like some people are (30:06 - 30:11)
into dad jokes i guess and so for eight (30:09 - 30:13)
dollars it might be worth it to them (30:11 - 30:16)
but i said this again if if if you (30:13 - 30:17)
planned on using the items (30:16 - 30:20)
you're getting your value there i mean (30:17 - 30:22)
three super incubators is six bucks (30:20 - 30:25)
two lower modules is four dollars that's (30:22 - 30:26)
ten dollars right there (30:25 - 30:28)
if you really wanted the pose that's you (30:26 - 30:30)
know poses are normally five dollars (30:28 - 30:32)
so if you wanted all the items that's (30:30 - 30:34)
fine but i think overall (30:32 - 30:37)
having a two-day event weekend (30:34 - 30:40)
having your so you not only do you i (30:37 - 30:41)
think this is the problem (30:40 - 30:44)
you not only do you have to pay the 7.99 (30:41 - 30:47)
you have to then use incense which (30:44 - 30:49)
the event does technically give you they (30:47 - 30:50)
give you three incense i think at the (30:49 - 30:52)
start of the quest line but i think (30:50 - 30:53)
that's the one you have to do it's like (30:52 - 30:55)
transfer 10 pokemon to get (30:53 - 30:57)
three incense so you can get the three (30:55 - 30:59)
incense off the bat if you for whatever (30:57 - 31:01)
reason had eight dollars to spend but (30:59 - 31:02)
didn't have another dollar twenty to (31:01 - 31:03)
spend for (31:02 - 31:06)
incense you spend eight dollars and then (31:03 - 31:06)
you (31:06 - 31:10)
have to pop incense to like get the (31:06 - 31:12)
ice pokemon to appear and then that's (31:10 - 31:13)
kind of (31:12 - 31:15)
it but you would be popping incense (31:13 - 31:17)
anyways because like (31:15 - 31:19)
niantic said hey if you don't have a (31:17 - 31:21)
ticket if you pop incense you get the (31:19 - 31:24)
cup chews and the jinxes and the uh (31:21 - 31:26)
whatever other pokemon we're supposed to (31:24 - 31:28)
spawn spoinks (31:26 - 31:30)
well i just had a realization that i (31:28 - 31:31)
don't (31:30 - 31:36)
i don't have mr mime in my canto (31:31 - 31:39)
oh this would count that's so (31:36 - 31:41)
now all of a sudden it's extra i just (31:39 - 31:42)
deleted pokemon go because it's like i (31:41 - 31:43)
need to get (31:42 - 31:46)
a mr mine i'll pay eight dollars to get (31:43 - 31:47)
that in my pokedex (31:46 - 31:51)
yeah this i yeah this (31:47 - 31:51)
this this event was just very (31:51 - 31:54)
disappointing and it was kind of (31:53 - 31:56)
disappointing (31:54 - 31:58)
but it was disappointing on paper but it (31:56 - 32:00)
was even more disappointing in execution (31:58 - 32:03)
i don't know you should been able to pay (32:00 - 32:03)
like (32:03 - 32:06)
the eight dollars and just have i think (32:03 - 32:07)
the way they would have (32:06 - 32:09)
maybe been slightly able to fix it is (32:07 - 32:11)
you pay eight dollars and you have a (32:09 - 32:13)
permanent incense throughout the entire (32:11 - 32:17)
event like you gave me three (32:13 - 32:19)
with the purchase of a ticket but that (32:17 - 32:21)
only covers (32:19 - 32:24)
nine hours which some could argue is (32:21 - 32:25)
like more than enough time i mean you (32:24 - 32:27)
complete the event in like (32:25 - 32:30)
you complete the ven in an hour um the (32:27 - 32:31)
only thing that might be stopping you (32:30 - 32:34)
is if you're on your couch at some point (32:31 - 32:35)
you have to like walk to a poke stop (32:34 - 32:36)
spin it and then you can go back to your (32:35 - 32:38)
couch (32:36 - 32:40)
assuming you don't reach a pokestop from (32:38 - 32:43)
your couch you're like here's mr mime (32:40 - 32:45)
you only get two of them here's a two (32:43 - 32:47)
day event (32:45 - 32:48)
but the three incense we give you only (32:47 - 32:50)
cover nine hours of it (32:48 - 32:52)
and the spawns you're getting are the (32:50 - 32:55)
same spawns as the free event (32:52 - 32:57)
and you get you get like maybe like two (32:55 - 32:59)
minutes of dad jokes (32:57 - 33:01)
but all in all that just doesn't feel (32:59 - 33:03)
like an ex like that doesn't (33:01 - 33:05)
feel like an experience and cost aside (33:03 - 33:07)
whether this was a two dollar (33:05 - 33:11)
10 15 i want (33:07 - 33:13)
an experience like if i'm going to go to (33:11 - 33:14)
a movie theater (33:13 - 33:16)
i'm paying for like the nice seat the (33:14 - 33:18)
good audio the big screen (33:16 - 33:21)
the smell of popcorn and then i walk out (33:18 - 33:22)
and i'm like (33:21 - 33:25)
man that movie like i want to see that (33:22 - 33:26)
movie again (33:25 - 33:28)
in the theater because of that (33:26 - 33:30)
experience versus (33:28 - 33:31)
that movie doesn't seem good enough or (33:30 - 33:33)
the experience isn't good enough to (33:31 - 33:35)
convince me to go to the movie theater (33:33 - 33:36)
so i'll wait for the netflix version you (33:35 - 33:37)
know what i mean am i (33:36 - 33:40)
is does that make any sense i just i'm i (33:37 - 33:42)
sort of lost it at you going to a movie (33:40 - 33:43)
theater but (33:42 - 33:45)
i'm suspending my disbelief to go with (33:43 - 33:47)
your metaphor yeah yeah yeah (33:45 - 33:50)
some movies are worth it in theater some (33:47 - 33:51)
movies are movies are worth it (33:50 - 33:54)
yeah yeah yeah most pokemon movies are (33:51 - 33:56)
not worth it in theaters no you know (33:54 - 34:00)
no no they are not and yet i keep doing (33:56 - 34:02)
it i keep trying i keep having that (34:00 - 34:04)
little spark of hope (34:02 - 34:06)
maybe this one will capture maybe the (34:04 - 34:08)
jungle one the secret is to go (34:06 - 34:12)
and see a pokemon movie in hawaii (34:08 - 34:15)
then it's worth it okay i mean i (34:12 - 34:17)
would worth it to go strip to hawaii (34:15 - 34:19)
yeah the mr mime event just (34:17 - 34:22)
very lackluster did you did you buy the (34:19 - 34:23)
ticket yeah (34:22 - 34:24)
did you yes and now since i had to (34:23 - 34:26)
reinstall pokemon go (34:24 - 34:27)
i have to go through all of the (34:26 - 34:29)
introductory everything (34:27 - 34:32)
all over again all right well let's take (34:29 - 34:33)
a quick break (34:32 - 34:36)
when we come back we got some more (34:33 - 34:39)
pokemon news (34:36 - 34:39)
[Music] (34:40 - 34:47)
we'll pay for the cow just bring the cow (34:45 - 34:49)
out (34:47 - 34:49)
[Music] (34:51 - 34:54)
[Music] (34:57 - 35:04)
now (35:01 - 35:04)
[Music] (35:09 - 35:18)
bringing out a cow (35:11 - 35:18)
we are back from our break (35:26 - 35:32)
let's talk about battle styles (35:29 - 35:35)
did you guys see the trailer i saw the (35:32 - 35:36)
trailer (35:35 - 35:38)
the trailer made me actually think about (35:36 - 35:41)
maybe playing the game when that cram (35:38 - 35:44)
got smacked like the garbage it is i was (35:41 - 35:46)
like this is the content i'm here for (35:44 - 35:50)
my problem is that trailer (35:46 - 35:52)
was very misleading because none of that (35:50 - 35:54)
actually happens (35:52 - 35:56)
in the trading card game and if it were (35:54 - 35:59)
to happen he would be disqualified (35:56 - 36:00)
it was a pretty hyped trailer though it (35:59 - 36:02)
was a good trailer (36:00 - 36:06)
i i briefly thought oh maybe this is (36:02 - 36:07)
when i get it nope (36:06 - 36:09)
i'm not getting any money for that yeah (36:07 - 36:11)
the trailer is really great if uh if you (36:09 - 36:13)
haven't seen it it's on the pokemon (36:11 - 36:13)
youtube (36:13 - 36:15)
it's just called battle styles it's a (36:13 - 36:17)
trailer for the trading card game it's (36:15 - 36:18)
pretty cool though (36:17 - 36:21)
they they show a lot of animated pokemon (36:18 - 36:21)
and (36:21 - 36:24)
a lot of if you like hershey foo you get (36:21 - 36:26)
your urshifu fan service (36:24 - 36:28)
the press release here says do you feel (36:26 - 36:29)
like (36:28 - 36:31)
taking down your opponent with a single (36:29 - 36:33)
powerful punch (36:31 - 36:35)
or seizing victory with a clever (36:33 - 36:36)
technical tactics that keep your (36:35 - 36:37)
opponent (36:36 - 36:40)
guessing you'll soon get the choice with (36:37 - 36:40)
the (36:40 - 36:43)
release of the pokemon tcg sword and (36:40 - 36:46)
shield battle styles expansion coming on (36:43 - 36:47)
march 19th (36:46 - 36:50)
the expansion will debut exciting new (36:47 - 36:50)
game (36:50 - 36:53)
play mechanics called battle styles (36:50 - 36:54)
introduce two (36:53 - 36:56)
different forms of attack single strike (36:54 - 36:57)
and rapid strike (36:56 - 36:59)
the former is the pokemon equivalent of (36:57 - 37:00)
throwing a knockout punch (36:59 - 37:02)
the latter is like a chess game of using (37:00 - 37:03)
tactical (37:02 - 37:07)
attacks to build a steady victory (37:03 - 37:09)
single strike cards are accented with (37:07 - 37:10)
red while rapid strikes (37:09 - 37:13)
are adorned in blue they're really (37:10 - 37:15)
stretching for their vocabulary here (37:13 - 37:18)
they got a thesaurus and they're not (37:15 - 37:19)
afraid to use it (37:18 - 37:21)
additionally but this is where we insert (37:19 - 37:22)
our grammarly ad (37:21 - 37:25)
additionally both trainers and cards are (37:22 - 37:27)
available in single strike and rapid (37:25 - 37:28)
strike to help trainers build decks (37:27 - 37:30)
around battle style of choice (37:28 - 37:33)
and there are two elite trainer boxes (37:30 - 37:34)
coming out (37:33 - 37:36)
battle styles expansion will also (37:34 - 37:38)
feature 60 battle style cards (37:36 - 37:42)
12 pokemon v's 16 full art v's (37:38 - 37:46)
six pokemon v-max 19 trainer cards (37:42 - 37:48)
six full art supporters and two special (37:46 - 37:49)
energy (37:48 - 37:51)
right explain it all to me because i'm (37:49 - 37:52)
completely confused i ain't got no idea (37:51 - 37:55)
what's it what's a battle style card is (37:52 - 37:56)
that not a pokemon (37:55 - 37:58)
is it guys a supporter is it not an item (37:56 - 37:59)
what's going on sure (37:58 - 38:01)
is it really really easy to explain (37:59 - 38:03)
they've done this mechanic before (38:01 - 38:06)
so think of it kind of like e x and g (38:03 - 38:09)
x ultimately they're the same except (38:06 - 38:13)
that they can change the dialogue on the (38:09 - 38:15)
card to be like (38:13 - 38:17)
search in your deck for any gx pokemon (38:15 - 38:18)
right (38:17 - 38:22)
uh so then it it slowly eliminates (38:18 - 38:26)
like the usefulness of ex even though (38:22 - 38:28)
there's not a real big difference (38:26 - 38:29)
between the two it's just (38:28 - 38:32)
another thing they can write on the card (38:29 - 38:34)
so in this situation i think (38:32 - 38:36)
this is more comparable to what when the (38:34 - 38:38)
gym leader stuff came out (38:36 - 38:42)
a good example would be ability (38:38 - 38:46)
adds 20 plus damage to all of brock's (38:42 - 38:47)
pokemon (38:46 - 38:49)
so if you had like brock's sand slash or (38:47 - 38:52)
brock's onyx or brock's geodude (38:49 - 38:53)
if they were in play and then you had a (38:52 - 38:56)
pokemon that would add 20 damage to all (38:53 - 38:56)
brock's (38:56 - 38:59)
pokemon that's ultimately what this is (38:56 - 39:00)
doing (38:59 - 39:03)
so for example you could run like (39:00 - 39:07)
single strike hershey foo v (39:03 - 39:10)
max which has a g (39:07 - 39:13)
max one blow for three fighting energies (39:10 - 39:16)
one colorless energy for 270 damage (39:13 - 39:19)
and if you had mbor single strike on (39:16 - 39:20)
your bench (39:19 - 39:24)
emboars ability fighting fury stance (39:20 - 39:27)
your single strike pokemon attacks do 20 (39:24 - 39:28)
more damage (39:27 - 39:30)
to your opponent so just by having mbr (39:28 - 39:31)
on the bench (39:30 - 39:34)
g max one blow would do 290 instead of (39:31 - 39:36)
270 (39:34 - 39:38)
because no one's gonna use that heap no (39:36 - 39:39)
one's gonna use that mbor to attack i (39:38 - 39:41)
can tell you that much (39:39 - 39:45)
mbor card is real not great (39:41 - 39:47)
that's pretty much the gist of it is (39:45 - 39:49)
this a game changer is this gonna get (39:47 - 39:51)
you both back into the game (39:49 - 39:54)
oh heck no no no no no no (39:51 - 39:56)
the mechanics of the pokemon trading (39:54 - 39:57)
card game (39:56 - 39:59)
consistently change and i like that (39:57 - 40:01)
every three months there's always new (39:59 - 40:02)
cards and (40:01 - 40:04)
because of that usually new decks or (40:02 - 40:06)
current decks get stronger or (40:04 - 40:09)
or keep having to pay in money every (40:06 - 40:10)
three months yeah (40:09 - 40:12)
to buy more singles and build a (40:10 - 40:14)
competitive meta deck okay sure (40:12 - 40:16)
uh but there's two problems one i can't (40:14 - 40:17)
play in person and (40:16 - 40:20)
two that my alternative which is the (40:17 - 40:22)
pokemon trading card game online (40:20 - 40:25)
is very bad so that's kind of the (40:22 - 40:27)
problem right now (40:25 - 40:28)
uh i mean like the pokemon trading card (40:27 - 40:31)
game is like fine (40:28 - 40:34)
for me there is there's really only one (40:31 - 40:35)
thing that would ever get me (40:34 - 40:38)
back into playing pokemon trading card (40:35 - 40:38)
game (40:38 - 40:41)
like i mean yeah i'll buy like a starter (40:38 - 40:42)
deck for (40:41 - 40:44)
fun and sit down and play with somebody (40:42 - 40:45)
and throw away all the cards when i'm (40:44 - 40:46)
done (40:45 - 40:49)
but i would need them if i was going to (40:46 - 40:51)
play competitive again (40:49 - 40:53)
i would need them to create i would i (40:51 - 40:54)
would call it (40:53 - 40:56)
and i know there's some issues with (40:54 - 40:58)
calling it this but whatever (40:56 - 41:01)
senior level and that would be (40:58 - 41:04)
only people who are like 30 years old (41:01 - 41:06)
and older (41:04 - 41:08)
because the attitude that you get from (41:06 - 41:09)
people who are (41:08 - 41:12)
16 to 29 playing pokemon tcg (41:09 - 41:15)
is what drove me out of the game i'm (41:12 - 41:17)
like the opposite will (41:15 - 41:21)
when i sat across from from pokey dad (41:17 - 41:24)
i wanted to lose my mind like i would (41:21 - 41:25)
rather play against (41:24 - 41:28)
16 year old edgelord who doesn't want to (41:25 - 41:30)
like talk the entire match (41:28 - 41:33)
then very over talkative (41:30 - 41:37)
very positive pokedad turns into (41:33 - 41:40)
very rude uh sore loser pokey dad once (41:37 - 41:42)
you start beating them (41:40 - 41:44)
you're right i'm not getting back into (41:42 - 41:45)
the game at all (41:44 - 41:47)
[Laughter] (41:45 - 41:49)
because all pokey dads go through that (41:47 - 41:51)
emotional (41:49 - 41:53)
uh turmoil through the match they always (41:51 - 41:55)
start off super friendly they're really (41:53 - 41:57)
chatty they gotta let you know that (41:55 - 41:59)
they're only here because of their kid (41:57 - 42:01)
and then as soon as they realize they're (41:59 - 42:03)
in a losing position (42:01 - 42:05)
they become extremely rude and they're (42:03 - 42:07)
the biggest sore loser ever (42:05 - 42:11)
yeah 100 of the time without fail (42:07 - 42:13)
every single one i don't know if this is (42:11 - 42:15)
the same in like magic but (42:13 - 42:18)
there are no pokey dads in magic magic (42:15 - 42:20)
dads i only play commander (42:18 - 42:23)
and i haven't played that in a year no (42:20 - 42:25)
it's different because (42:23 - 42:28)
of the whole concept right (42:25 - 42:31)
that let's put it in words that we can (42:28 - 42:31)
all (42:31 - 42:34)
palette or that are palatable for (42:31 - 42:34)
everyone (42:34 - 42:39)
that the pokemon tcg is an all ages (42:34 - 42:42)
game where people do not look at magic (42:39 - 42:43)
the gathering as an (42:42 - 42:47)
all ages game true so you don't have (42:43 - 42:49)
magic dads bringing i mean yes there are (42:47 - 42:51)
people who have been playing magic since (42:49 - 42:52)
inception or (42:51 - 42:53)
since for a very long part of their (42:52 - 42:55)
lives and like i want to bring my kids (42:53 - 42:56)
into this (42:55 - 43:00)
but the majority of magic players don't (42:56 - 43:00)
get to become (43:00 - 43:01)
parents (43:00 - 43:01)
[Laughter] (43:01 - 43:04)
[Music] (43:01 - 43:04)
[Applause] (43:05 - 43:09)
i mean so far judging by the group that (43:07 - 43:11)
i play in we're a zero for (43:09 - 43:15)
zero for kids you got that right so (43:11 - 43:18)
also some of those magic cards are scary (43:15 - 43:21)
yeah they got people's they're (43:18 - 43:23)
doing bad things to other people on (43:21 - 43:24)
those cards it is not (43:23 - 43:26)
family friendly uh some of the art on (43:24 - 43:28)
some of the cards there yes (43:26 - 43:30)
it said there are certain cars that i (43:28 - 43:32)
just won't play i know they're good but (43:30 - 43:33)
i'm like no i can't sit looking (43:32 - 43:37)
at this art so it will never happen (43:33 - 43:39)
ah the battle styles expansion comes out (43:37 - 43:41)
in english in march which is actually (43:39 - 43:42)
they normally do a set every three (43:41 - 43:43)
months (43:42 - 43:46)
but this is a four month gap but i think (43:43 - 43:48)
they're only pushing it an extra month (43:46 - 43:49)
is because they're coming out with those (43:48 - 43:50)
shining (43:49 - 43:54)
shining fates what are the hidden fates (43:50 - 43:56)
shining legends shining fates whatever (43:54 - 43:57)

the region all players must register (45:14 - 45:18)
online before qualifying see details for (45:16 - 45:18)
that (45:18 - 45:21)
this is all pokemon.com so i'm sure i'm (45:18 - 45:22)
sure we'll get (45:21 - 45:25)
more details (45:22 - 45:29)
after christmas but for the vgc part of (45:25 - 45:29)
it (45:29 - 45:32)
i don't see why it wouldn't be series (45:29 - 45:33)
seven unless for some reason they messed (45:32 - 45:35)
this up again (45:33 - 45:37)
but it's been series seven for the last (45:35 - 45:39)
since november first (45:37 - 45:42)
december is also series seven january's (45:39 - 45:43)
plan for series seven (45:42 - 45:44)
i don't think we're supposed to get (45:43 - 45:47)
series eight until february (45:44 - 45:50)
but i don't know if that means like (45:47 - 45:53)
well i guess no no no because you could (45:50 - 45:55)
qualify (45:53 - 45:57)
yeah because for siri for players cup 2 (45:55 - 45:59)
you qualified using (45:57 - 46:01)
series five because that was the (45:59 - 46:03)
complaint but then you played (46:01 - 46:06)
in the qualifier using (46:03 - 46:09)
series seven series six was two months (46:06 - 46:11)
long but it took them (46:09 - 46:14)
that long to do all that stuff anyways (46:11 - 46:15)
it's cool that they're doing another (46:14 - 46:15)
player's cut (46:15 - 46:18)
i think it's uh i think it's proven (46:15 - 46:19)
pretty well (46:18 - 46:22)
to host these tournaments online okay (46:19 - 46:23)
final bit of news we have for the week (46:22 - 46:26)

lot of people (47:11 - 47:16)
are probably done oh yeah easy check (47:12 - 47:19)
known history of pokemon check (47:16 - 47:24)
if you did the first part (47:19 - 47:27)
second part is done having master (47:24 - 47:29)
ranking in pokemon (47:27 - 47:31)
what does that mean uh that's (47:29 - 47:32)
competitive (47:31 - 47:35)
yeah okay master ball ranking watched (47:32 - 47:38)
500 plus episodes of the anime done (47:35 - 47:41)
ah i'm out done done done except for the (47:38 - 47:44)
master ball i can get that in a weekend (47:41 - 47:47)
how much does it pay i don't think it (47:44 - 47:50)
says well you know it's 10 cents so (47:47 - 47:54)
so 10 cents 10 cents an hour (47:50 - 47:55)
i don't i don't even know what like the (47:54 - 47:58)
average wage in china is (47:55 - 48:01)
i don't know uh it depends on the job (47:58 - 48:04)
like in america well the average (48:01 - 48:07)
the average household income in (48:04 - 48:11)
wisconsin is 60 000 which is probably (48:07 - 48:12)
really low compared to you know the (48:11 - 48:14)
coast uh (48:12 - 48:16)
depends on which part of the coast the (48:14 - 48:17)
average household income in south (48:16 - 48:18)
carolina (48:17 - 48:21)
is not that much yeah but also like (48:18 - 48:23)
milwaukee's minimum wage is 7.50 where (48:21 - 48:25)
in some places the minimum wage is 15. (48:23 - 48:29)
okay so average average (48:25 - 48:32)
i'm looking up a consultant in china uh (48:29 - 48:33)
i'm assuming that's (48:32 - 48:36)
yen chinese yen (48:33 - 48:39)
oh yeah maybe (48:36 - 48:43)
one it's 131 an hour (48:39 - 48:46)
so i don't know what that actually is in (48:43 - 48:49)
dollars annual per capita disposable (48:46 - 48:53)
income of urban households in china from (48:49 - 48:55)
blah blah 1990 to 2019. so we're looking (48:53 - 48:57)
in 2019 it is (48:55 - 49:04)
42 359 yuan (48:57 - 49:08)
we'll say mr google how much is that (49:04 - 49:11)
in u.s dollars (49:08 - 49:14)
not australian dollars that is 51 (49:11 - 49:17)
783 wait that's euro (49:14 - 49:20)
oops (49:17 - 49:20)
uh according to consultant salary in (49:20 - 49:24)
china from (49:24 - 49:29)
economic research institute 131 (49:24 - 49:31)
an hour comes out to twenty dollars an (49:29 - 49:32)
hour (49:31 - 49:35)
in the united states so the average per (49:32 - 49:37)
capita urban (49:35 - 49:39)
household income blah blah qualifier (49:37 - 49:40)
this that and the other (49:39 - 49:42)
six thousand four hundred and seventy (49:40 - 49:45)
nine dollars per year i'm assuming they (49:42 - 49:48)
the the master ball ranking is (49:45 - 49:50)
they want somebody that understands (49:48 - 49:52)
competitive so just because you've (49:50 - 49:54)
played 900 plus hours of pokemon game (49:52 - 49:55)
just because you've watched a lot of (49:54 - 49:58)
anime that that that is important but (49:55 - 49:59)
pokemon unite is (49:58 - 50:04)
a competitive game it's a moba (49:59 - 50:07)
so i can't imagine somebody like there's (50:04 - 50:08)
probably some shiny hunters sitting out (50:07 - 50:10)
there being (50:08 - 50:12)
very excited that they have 900 hours (50:10 - 50:14)
and they love the anime and then (50:12 - 50:17)
they want to apply for this maybe not (50:14 - 50:18)
realizing that (50:17 - 50:20)
tencent is working on pokemon unite and (50:18 - 50:22)
then sit there and go well (50:20 - 50:24)
i don't know maybe they should attack (50:22 - 50:26)
you like they clearly want somebody who (50:24 - 50:28)
who understands like competitive (50:26 - 50:31)
um would be mine what about all the (50:28 - 50:32)
hours that i've poured into playing (50:31 - 50:35)
league and dota don't doesn't that count (50:32 - 50:36)
for anything (50:35 - 50:39)
i'm sure would yeah not according to (50:36 - 50:40)
that (50:39 - 50:44)
list no well i think the other probably (50:40 - 50:46)
thing that's not mentioned here is (50:44 - 50:49)
probably need to know what are what's (50:46 - 50:50)
china's spoken languages (50:49 - 50:53)
is it mandarin and cantonese is like (50:50 - 50:54)
written language it's not (50:53 - 50:57)
spoken right no mandarin and cantonese (50:54 - 50:59)
are the spoken languages (50:57 - 51:00)
and then they have different alphabets (50:59 - 51:02)
for writing yep (51:00 - 51:04)
oh okay so you probably have to know (51:02 - 51:06)
that not languages (51:04 - 51:09)
dialects are both chinese (51:06 - 51:11)
they're just different dialects got it (51:09 - 51:13)
yeah you know like (51:11 - 51:15)
the south is a different dialect there (51:13 - 51:17)
no (51:15 - 51:17)
that is not how it works (51:17 - 51:20)
i think it's cool that they're looking (51:20 - 51:23)
for like i think it's cool they're (51:22 - 51:25)
looking for a consultant (51:23 - 51:28)
i suppose the comments could just be (51:25 - 51:30)
as such why don't they talk to the (51:28 - 51:32)
pokemon company about things but (51:30 - 51:34)
i don't think any of these people have (51:32 - 51:36)
had a nine-to-five job because having (51:34 - 51:36)
somebody (51:36 - 51:39)
on staff is is pretty vital yeah (51:36 - 51:42)
like you still need you see like you can (51:39 - 51:43)
you can't email everything having (51:42 - 51:44)
somebody (51:43 - 51:47)
on staff who knows what they're talking (51:44 - 51:49)
about is invaluable so that when you (51:47 - 51:51)
send a big report to (51:49 - 51:54)
you know papa pokemon they're like (51:51 - 51:56)
okay redo your entire report because (51:54 - 51:59)
pages 10 through 20 are completely wrong (51:56 - 52:01)
and then get back to us thanks yeah none (51:59 - 52:02)
of this is weird (52:01 - 52:05)
uh it would be very similar to your (52:02 - 52:06)
company (52:05 - 52:09)
hiring its own accountant you could (52:06 - 52:12)
you could make the argument well there's (52:09 - 52:13)
millions of accountants (52:12 - 52:15)
we only need them for taxes why are we (52:13 - 52:17)
hiring them why don't we just hire one (52:15 - 52:18)
to come (52:17 - 52:20)
is that is that a statement you you (52:18 - 52:22)
actually believe (52:20 - 52:24)
what it's i think it's pretty vital for (52:22 - 52:25)
a company to have their own (52:24 - 52:28)
accountant on staff i meant we only need (52:25 - 52:30)
them for taxes (52:28 - 52:32)
look i worked at a real bad start up (52:30 - 52:33)
there there's a reason they went out of (52:32 - 52:34)
business (52:33 - 52:36)
accountants do a heck of a lot more than (52:34 - 52:39)
just taxes my friend (52:36 - 52:41)
well a pokemon consultant would probably (52:39 - 52:43)
do a whole lot more than just (52:41 - 52:46)
answering questions true (52:43 - 52:48)
i mean do you think it's just a person (52:46 - 52:50)
who sits in the office and then somebody (52:48 - 52:51)
runs in with like (52:50 - 52:55)
a picture and just says who's this (52:51 - 52:58)
how do you say it quick quick (52:55 - 53:03)
is this lucario or pikachu we are lost (52:58 - 53:05)
what does casco evolve into we don't (53:03 - 53:06)
know oh no (53:05 - 53:09)
how do you how do you know how do you (53:06 - 53:10)
know (53:09 - 53:12)
wait you're telling me not to put gormus (53:10 - 53:15)
into the game why (53:12 - 53:18)
[Laughter] (53:15 - 53:20)
yeah it's like the same thing for an (53:18 - 53:21)
accountant you walk in and you're like (53:20 - 53:23)
quick what was my tip on today's lunch i (53:21 - 53:24)
don't know (53:23 - 53:28)
i don't know quick what are my taxes (53:24 - 53:31)
and why did this make news because you (53:28 - 53:32)
made it new (53:31 - 53:34)
whatever you decided to make it news (53:32 - 53:36)
well i i'm assuming we're getting (53:34 - 53:37)
pokemon unite (53:36 - 53:40)
in 2021 uh yeah right after pokemon (53:37 - 53:41)

[Laughter] (53:45 - 53:48)
push start i can't remember that (53:47 - 53:50)
company's name push start (53:48 - 53:52)
yeah they need a sleep consultant have (53:50 - 53:53)
you gotten (53:52 - 53:57)
47 hours of sleep have you guys (53:53 - 54:00)
know somebody who is such (53:57 - 54:03)
a sleep expert that they literally (54:00 - 54:05)
have a t-shirt possibly they want it in (54:03 - 54:07)
a sleeping contest (54:05 - 54:10)
that says sleep i'm a big fan (54:07 - 54:13)
yes big fan i (54:10 - 54:16)
am that person is not me because i am (54:13 - 54:18)
really bad at sleeping i (54:16 - 54:20)
i pretty much fail at it every time (54:18 - 54:21)
level (54:20 - 54:25)
sleep i i can sleep anywhere (54:21 - 54:29)
anytime you say go to sleep i'm out (54:25 - 54:31)
i can do it i've trained for this (54:29 - 54:32)
consulting (54:31 - 54:34)
my entire life you need to own at least (54:32 - 54:38)
30 pillows (54:34 - 54:42)

a it's a holy week only china's working (54:49 - 54:54)
right now (54:52 - 54:57)
we're using that news thought okay ready (54:54 - 55:01)
maca is the thing to say when you want (54:57 - 55:04)
the question of the week (55:01 - 55:06)
technically no that is not the thing you (55:04 - 55:08)
say when you want the question of the (55:06 - 55:08)
week (55:08 - 55:11)
and i wish you wouldn't confuse our for (55:08 - 55:14)
cakeys out there look nobody knows what (55:11 - 55:15)
that language is (55:14 - 55:20)
and nobody cares excuses (55:15 - 55:22)
how rude (55:20 - 55:24)
[Laughter] (55:22 - 55:25)
all right this week's question is from (55:24 - 55:27)
mark which trainers (55:25 - 55:30)
slash gym leaders netflix documentary (55:27 - 55:31)
would you be most (55:30 - 55:35)
interested in watching (55:31 - 55:36)
why does it have to be a netflix (55:35 - 55:38)
documentary why can't it just be a (55:36 - 55:40)
documentary i mean there's a documentary (55:38 - 55:42)
that they bought from somewhere else and (55:40 - 55:43)
then they just put (55:42 - 55:44)
netflix original in from it because they (55:43 - 55:46)
bought the rights but they had nothing (55:44 - 55:47)
to do with producing it (55:46 - 55:51)
oh isn't that 20 20 in a nutshell (55:47 - 55:53)
uh i think tobias would be pretty (55:51 - 55:54)
interesting i'd like to know how (55:53 - 55:58)
i guess a real character yes (55:54 - 56:00)
he's the one that beats ash with the (55:58 - 56:01)
darkrai (56:00 - 56:04)
and the latios but he's not a gym leader (56:01 - 56:08)
hey it's a gym leader slash trainer oh (56:04 - 56:11)
i would love to know how i won the (56:08 - 56:13)
sinnoh championship (56:11 - 56:16)
and how he caught his darkrai in latius (56:13 - 56:18)
and where he got his like (56:16 - 56:22)
dark magician cape from the anime is not (56:18 - 56:22)
canon (56:22 - 56:26)
thank you i feel like (56:22 - 56:30)
we already know the type of person that (56:26 - 56:33)
brings legendaries to a champion (56:30 - 56:35)
battle like we already know who that (56:33 - 56:37)
person is and we already know what a (56:35 - 56:38)
cosplayer is (56:37 - 56:39)
i don't think there's a lot of room for (56:38 - 56:41)
an interesting documentary there (56:39 - 56:44)
who have we never seen a lot of oh i (56:41 - 56:45)
know (56:44 - 56:48)
i did the bryson man documentary that (56:45 - 56:50)
dude's life (56:48 - 56:53)
all the films all the stages (56:50 - 56:55)
why he keeps showing up when you don't (56:53 - 56:57)
want him i'm all into that (56:55 - 57:01)
bryson man documentary for me i wonder (56:57 - 57:04)
because i i will admit i'm terrible at (57:01 - 57:05)
like the two things in pokemon that i'm (57:04 - 57:07)
terrible at that will keep me from (57:05 - 57:08)
getting that job at 10 (57:07 - 57:10)
cent is i can never remember the names (57:08 - 57:12)
of pokemon places like towns (57:10 - 57:14)
and anything and i never remember the (57:12 - 57:18)
names of like the gym leaders or (57:14 - 57:23)
or anything like that what a tough one (57:18 - 57:24)
you know i bet would actually have a (57:23 - 57:26)
very interesting life for a documentary (57:24 - 57:27)
it's opal (57:26 - 57:31)
yeah yeah opal has a lot (57:27 - 57:33)
i'm sure there's all like there's a (57:31 - 57:35)
whole lot you can cover with opal i (57:33 - 57:37)
think opal's documentary would be (57:35 - 57:37)
amazing (57:37 - 57:39)
who is oh there you go i was going to (57:37 - 57:41)
say who is the psychic gym leader from (57:39 - 57:43)
kalos olivia (57:41 - 57:47)
yeah olivia's got a lot going on olympia (57:43 - 57:50)
olympia olympia okay see i told you i (57:47 - 57:52)
can't (57:50 - 57:54)
you know whose documentaries i would not (57:52 - 57:56)
watch ramos (57:54 - 57:58)
silly and chilly and chris yeah would (57:56 - 58:00)
you oh (57:58 - 58:03)
so they wouldn't a documentary you see (58:00 - 58:03)
wouldn't be (58:03 - 58:06)

show where they're running a restaurant (58:06 - 58:10)
yes i am (58:08 - 58:13)
those three cuties heck yeah i would (58:10 - 58:14)
watch (58:13 - 58:16)
master chef unova and those three would (58:14 - 58:18)
be the judges i would be into that (58:16 - 58:20)
i know i just want to see them running a (58:18 - 58:23)
restaurant with their monkeys (58:20 - 58:25)
and like all the hijinks that ensue (58:23 - 58:27)
elisa would have a good (58:25 - 58:29)
modeling one at least nessa would have a (58:27 - 58:30)
good one (58:29 - 58:32)
all the touring of the pokemon fashion (58:30 - 58:34)
world they could run project runway i (58:32 - 58:35)
feel like (58:34 - 58:37)
all modded modeling documentaries get (58:35 - 58:39)
real dark (58:37 - 58:43)
yeah real quick real dark real quick (58:39 - 58:46)
from hohen there were the two twins (58:43 - 58:49)
tayden elizabeth tate and eliza i wanna (58:46 - 58:51)
see uh where are they now (58:49 - 58:53)
yo yeah it's like they grew up and it's (58:51 - 58:56)
like what happened to them (58:53 - 58:58)
are they like the olsen twins did they (58:56 - 58:59)
fight start an uh (58:58 - 59:03)
pokemon fashion empire (58:59 - 59:03)
um let's talk about getting dark (59:03 - 59:09)
i think flannery's documentary would be (59:07 - 59:11)
very one note (59:09 - 59:14)
yeah she's very one note as a character (59:11 - 59:14)
she's just (59:14 - 59:19)
fire whitney (59:14 - 59:21)
whitney's would also be boring i did i (59:19 - 59:22)
did miss a (59:21 - 59:25)
very tiny uh bit of pokemon news here uh (59:22 - 59:26)
there is a (59:25 - 59:28)
diantha documentary there you go that's (59:26 - 59:29)
what we all want (59:28 - 59:31)
yeah that's what i want all right what (59:29 - 59:33)
was your boring news there is just a (59:31 - 59:35)
data mine that happened in pokemon go (59:33 - 59:39)
where there are um new hats on pikachu (59:35 - 59:43)
for uh new year's eve and new year's day (59:39 - 59:46)
just like little purple top hats (59:43 - 59:49)
um and then there's a holiday pikachu (59:46 - 59:50)
although i don't know (59:49 - 59:53)
keep in mind when we first saw the data (59:50 - 59:54)
mine for (59:53 - 59:56)
the stantler with the bells it took a (59:54 - 59:58)
whole year for that stantler to come (59:56 - 59:59)
forward (59:58 - 60:01)
so could be the case here there's a deli (59:59 - 60:03)
bird and a cub shoe with a bow (60:01 - 60:06)
there is a slow poke and a slow bro slow (60:03 - 60:08)
poke has 20 20 (60:06 - 60:10)
glasses on and the slowbro has 20 21 (60:08 - 60:12)
glasses on (60:10 - 60:13)
and then there's like the green sweater (60:12 - 60:15)
is gonna (60:13 - 60:18)
apparently be added to the store oh (60:15 - 60:20)
uh just a couple couple shirts and a (60:18 - 60:23)
couple hat pokemon no surprises there (60:20 - 60:26)
they might all show up maybe only some (60:23 - 60:27)
of them will show up just because things (60:26 - 60:28)
are data mined doesn't (60:27 - 60:31)
mean they're guaranteed so just a (60:28 - 60:33)
disclosure on that (60:31 - 60:35)
will give us our pokemon of the week (60:33 - 60:36)
well (60:35 - 60:39)
last week's pokemon was really (60:36 - 60:40)
complicated (60:39 - 60:43)
and confusing and that was on purpose (60:40 - 60:46)
there's a pokemon where (60:43 - 60:49)
it basically has three forms and it can (60:46 - 60:51)
evolve into (60:49 - 60:54)
two different pokemon one of those (60:51 - 60:55)
pokemon it can evolve into (60:54 - 60:59)
has two forms yes (60:55 - 61:03)
and then the third one is it's a (60:59 - 61:04)
different pokemon but it only has one (61:03 - 61:05)
form (61:04 - 61:09)
and i had something to say about korean (61:05 - 61:12)
beef in the middle of there yeah (61:09 - 61:16)
so who is (61:12 - 61:21)
that pokemon it's (61:16 - 61:21)
deli bird deli bird doesn't evolve in (61:21 - 61:26)
from anything i mean not yet not with (61:24 - 61:28)
that dude (61:26 - 61:32)
it's berserker perserker (61:28 - 61:36)
yes there is no shuffle icon (61:32 - 61:40)
now that's something this is too new i'm (61:36 - 61:42)
sorry but when did meowth become (61:40 - 61:45)
so incredibly confusing what (61:42 - 61:47)
look i've been saying for years that you (61:45 - 61:49)
guys everyone's complaining about (61:47 - 61:52)
charizard but meowth is the secret (61:49 - 61:54)
attention weapon that's what i said (61:52 - 61:55)
right (61:54 - 61:58)
there's only one pikachu form there are (61:55 - 61:58)
literally (61:58 - 62:01)
there's canto meowth there's a lowland (61:58 - 62:03)
meowth now there's glaring (62:01 - 62:06)
meowth and like the (62:03 - 62:10)
the the the the persian can be regular (62:06 - 62:10)
persian (62:10 - 62:12)
or it can be a lowland persian with the (62:10 - 62:14)
big garfield head (62:12 - 62:16)
and but then the glaring one can be a (62:14 - 62:17)
perserker (62:16 - 62:20)
meowth in the most episode of the animes (62:17 - 62:21)
besides pikachu (62:20 - 62:25)
miata is everywhere it's a meow (62:21 - 62:28)
economy on there how's that shiny does (62:25 - 62:29)
it have a shiny is there a shiny (62:28 - 62:30)
berserker (62:29 - 62:35)
it's gold i mean there is yeah it's the (62:30 - 62:35)
but also it's based off of hysterical (62:43 - 62:51)
stereotypical image of vikings (62:47 - 62:54)
yes i feel like i like if we had a (62:51 - 62:57)
pokemon league in minnesota (62:54 - 63:00)
berserker would be the mask i now that (62:57 - 63:01)
we have that available (63:00 - 63:04)
would agree because the football team is (63:01 - 63:05)
also (63:04 - 63:08)
the vikings yes all right (63:05 - 63:10)
this week's pokemon and as i have said (63:08 - 63:11)
frequently (63:10 - 63:16)
i will say again if you listen carefully (63:11 - 63:19)
this will not be as difficult as it (63:16 - 63:21)
seems (63:19 - 63:23)
all right i was in a pokemon trivia (63:21 - 63:25)
contest this past wednesday (63:23 - 63:27)
where there were people who were clearly (63:25 - 63:30)
cheating the contest was held over zoom (63:27 - 63:32)
i did not have a pokemon themed costume (63:30 - 63:34)
or stuffed animal (63:32 - 63:36)
and i forgot that a particular pokemon (63:34 - 63:38)
existed (63:36 - 63:40)
even though this pokemon has been around (63:38 - 63:42)
for almost 25 years (63:40 - 63:44)
i almost always completely blank on its (63:42 - 63:45)
name (63:44 - 63:47)
and i'm not talking about something like (63:45 - 63:49)
gum shoes remember all those memes (63:47 - 63:52)
this pokemon is clearly a standard (63:49 - 63:54)
bearer for the pokemon franchise in a (63:52 - 63:56)
number of media (63:54 - 63:59)
i think my main problem is that its two (63:56 - 64:01)
prior evolutions kind of follow (63:59 - 64:04)
a naming convention similar to gibbel (64:01 - 64:04)
and gabite (64:04 - 64:08)
but unlike garchomp this third pokemon (64:04 - 64:09)
takes its name from something else (64:08 - 64:10)
entirely (64:09 - 64:13)
it may be another case like gyarados (64:10 - 64:14)
where it was supposed to evolve (64:13 - 64:17)
from a different pokemon family the (64:14 - 64:18)
other problem (64:17 - 64:20)
is that its name refers to a story that (64:18 - 64:22)
is actually reflected by two other (64:20 - 64:23)
pokemon which (64:22 - 64:26)
with which it shares a type go let and (64:23 - 64:27)
go lurk (64:26 - 64:29)
in researching this week i also find it (64:27 - 64:31)
funny that it's shiny kind of looks like (64:29 - 64:32)
a nugget (64:31 - 64:35)
but it is not related to golden or gold (64:32 - 64:36)
duck (64:35 - 64:38)
there you go that's that's your clue for (64:36 - 64:40)
this week's pokemon uh (64:38 - 64:43)
will will be out of town next week for (64:40 - 64:45)
the holidays (64:43 - 64:47)
so it'll be greg and i and we'll we'll (64:45 - 64:50)
sneak somebody else on for sure (64:47 - 64:51)
we'll just because it's a holiday (64:50 - 64:53)
weekend doesn't mean there will not be (64:51 - 64:54)
an episode we will definitely be (64:53 - 64:55)
recording (64:54 - 65:00)
we will be doing twitch stuff all week (64:55 - 65:02)
so i like to stream i like to stream on (65:00 - 65:03)
twitch on holidays (65:02 - 65:05)
because uh being alone on the holiday (65:03 - 65:07)
really sucks and not a lot of people (65:05 - 65:08)
might be able to travel (65:07 - 65:10)
to see their family or friends so if you (65:08 - 65:11)
need something to do (65:10 - 65:14)
on christmas eve we'll be doing a short (65:11 - 65:15)
day stream (65:14 - 65:18)
and then i will be doing a longer uh (65:15 - 65:19)
evening stream (65:18 - 65:22)
on christmas day twitch.tv slash (65:19 - 65:23)
pkmncast (65:22 - 65:24)
so if you need something we'll be (65:23 - 65:26)
streaming all week uh my goal on (65:24 - 65:29)
christmas is to get magirna (65:26 - 65:30)
i have all the pokemon in place i'm (65:29 - 65:32)
missing seven pokemon (65:30 - 65:34)
and five of them are in pokemon bank (65:32 - 65:36)
getting ready to get moved up and the (65:34 - 65:36)
other two (65:36 - 65:39)
are kubfu and reggie drago so i'm just (65:36 - 65:41)
