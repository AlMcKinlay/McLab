foreign (0:01 - 0:04)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:29)
556th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:32)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:29 - 0:35)
with me is great guess what I solved a (0:32 - 0:37)
mystery yesterday (0:35 - 0:40)
with the one and only Sherlock Holmes (0:37 - 0:43)
who apparently according to the story I (0:40 - 0:45)
was told was locked into a locked in a (0:43 - 0:48)
room because of an exposure to bubonic (0:45 - 0:51)
plague (0:48 - 0:51)
but that's what I spent my morning doing (0:51 - 0:56)
solving a crime on Sherlock Holmes (0:52 - 0:57)
behalf (0:56 - 1:00)
so I solved it go to an escape room no (0:57 - 1:03)
it's it's an exhibit wait no no is that (1:00 - 1:05)
an escape room uh it's an exhibit at the (1:03 - 1:08)
Minnesota History Center (1:05 - 1:10)
um which is it's actually really really (1:08 - 1:11)
cool (1:10 - 1:12)
um (1:11 - 1:14)
they kind of like have to make it all (1:12 - 1:17)
ages so I'm not gonna say it was (1:14 - 1:21)
the hardest mystery ever assault but I (1:17 - 1:22)
did it (1:21 - 1:25)
and I know what happened now and I will (1:22 - 1:27)
not spoil it should you come to (1:25 - 1:29)
Minnesota and go to the Minnesota (1:27 - 1:30)
History Center which I do suggest (1:29 - 1:32)
because you can sit in a room that (1:30 - 1:34)
simulates what it's like to be in hiding (1:32 - 1:36)
in a basement during a tornado for those (1:34 - 1:38)
of you who have never had to do that in (1:36 - 1:40)
real life like I have that's that sounds (1:38 - 1:41)
bad for claustrophobic people you can (1:40 - 1:43)
leave that sounds (1:41 - 1:47)
the easiest way to bring up past trauma (1:43 - 1:50)
that too is fairly interesting if you've (1:47 - 1:53)
never done it uh yeah so that's what I (1:50 - 1:57)
did and then I went to a movie (1:53 - 1:57)
all right (1:58 - 2:00)
I (2:00 - 2:04)
did last week that my favorite Pokemon (2:02 - 2:06)
game is probably Pokemon go and it's (2:04 - 2:07)
very broken (2:06 - 2:10)
but it's not the only one of the games (2:07 - 2:13)
that's very broken (2:10 - 2:13)
just right now if you ask what is it (2:13 - 2:19)
it's broken you know yeah Pokemon go is (2:16 - 2:22)
broken scarlet and violet broke since (2:19 - 2:26)
launch never been fixed (2:22 - 2:26)
however I successfully dated my first (2:29 - 2:36)
set of people and I had to replace (2:33 - 2:39)
everybody so now I'm dating a whole new (2:36 - 2:40)
set of people and I have to know their (2:39 - 2:44)
likes and dislikes it's exhausting (2:40 - 2:46)
the dating simulator (2:44 - 2:49)
I was waiting for uh (2:46 - 2:52)
all three birds to be there unless I (2:49 - 2:53)
checked there was only three birds are (2:52 - 2:55)
there (2:53 - 2:57)
okay (2:55 - 2:58)
all right I didn't get I haven't gotten (2:57 - 3:00)
anything and I'm mad about it I guess I (2:58 - 3:02)
will pull this week (3:00 - 3:05)
uh well speaking of broken uh we're (3:02 - 3:07)
gonna start off with Pokemon go uh (3:05 - 3:09)
because there was two things in regards (3:07 - 3:10)
to Pokemon go then we're gonna (3:09 - 3:12)
transition into uh scarlet and violet (3:10 - 3:15)
because there is compatibility between (3:12 - 3:17)
Pokemon go and Scotland Violet and that (3:15 - 3:19)
that's a good transition Point uh and (3:17 - 3:20)
then there's some detective Pikachu (3:19 - 3:21)
stuff (3:20 - 3:24)
uh for what that's worth uh and then (3:21 - 3:26)
just decidue is this week so if you're (3:24 - 3:28)
listening to this podcast on March uh (3:26 - 3:30)
13th when it comes out decidueye arrives (3:28 - 3:32)
on the 17th although time zones are a (3:30 - 3:35)
thing so uh technically if you live in (3:32 - 3:37)
the US it will start on Thursday the (3:35 - 3:39)
16th of that evening (3:37 - 3:41)
uh and then I of course I'll be covering (3:39 - 3:43)
and streaming it this weekend if you (3:41 - 3:44)
need help and stuff we'll get to that (3:43 - 3:47)
when we get to that uh (3:44 - 3:50)
okay let's start with Pokemon go uh (3:47 - 3:54)
Reggie Drago made its debut in on (3:50 - 3:57)
Pokemon go uh not not the coolest Reggie (3:54 - 3:59)
it's no Reggie ellicky you know um the (3:57 - 4:02)
regular key is is I like Drago better (3:59 - 4:03)
than aliki (4:02 - 4:06)
draco's all right I like both of them (4:03 - 4:09)
yeah well I mean like overall the (4:06 - 4:11)
Reggie's they're they're top reggies uh (4:09 - 4:15)
they both have really good designs (4:11 - 4:15)
Reggie (4:15 - 4:19)
is his favorite how dare you rich I (4:16 - 4:22)
sorry Regice red cheese Rock registered (4:19 - 4:26)
voices in the movie yeah the movie (4:22 - 4:28)
voices are the best the movie voices are (4:26 - 4:29)
the best (4:28 - 4:32)
yeah yeah that's the only thing (4:29 - 4:36)
I mean they sounded they remind me of (4:32 - 4:39)
calling the bullet board system on my (4:36 - 4:41)
modem back in the 80s they make the same (4:39 - 4:44)
hisses and whizzes and spoiler alert if (4:41 - 4:46)
you pick up the phone while fighting at (4:44 - 4:49)
Reggie they will go offline (4:46 - 4:49)
okay (4:50 - 4:53)
uh so so if you're not into Pokemon go (4:51 - 4:55)
you might skip this segment totally (4:53 - 4:57)
understandable they're just a small (4:55 - 4:58)
reminder there's time stamps in the (4:57 - 5:01)
podcast and on the YouTube video all (4:58 - 5:04)
that stuff uh but if you like (5:01 - 5:06)
uh ironic news stories maybe you want to (5:04 - 5:09)
listen to me if you don't play again (5:06 - 5:11)
because uh (5:09 - 5:13)
boy something happened this weekend oh (5:11 - 5:15)
yeah it did (5:13 - 5:19)
all right so on March 10th the day (5:15 - 5:21)
before uh Reggie Drago made its debut (5:19 - 5:23)
now you have to put out a blog post that (5:21 - 5:26)
says our continued commitment to real (5:23 - 5:29)
world play in Pokemon go for those (5:26 - 5:31)
following Pokemon go week after week (5:29 - 5:33)
Niantic really wants you to leave your (5:31 - 5:35)
house (5:33 - 5:38)
game that's about exploring outside and (5:35 - 5:39)
uh (5:38 - 5:41)
um they also happen to make a bunch of (5:39 - 5:43)
changes that made playing at home a more (5:41 - 5:45)
enjoyable experience than leaving your (5:43 - 5:46)
house because leaving the house is scary (5:45 - 5:49)
there's you know weather and people and (5:46 - 5:54)
weather people grass that yeah people (5:49 - 5:58)
um so this is a uh uh they say they have (5:54 - 6:00)
a lot planned for 2023 (5:58 - 6:03)
they have three things bullet points (6:00 - 6:05)
here first is their game update uh (6:03 - 6:08)
they're saying Elite raids which is what (6:05 - 6:11)
Reggie Drago is uh featured in uh are (6:08 - 6:13)
going to feature new or unique Pokemon (6:11 - 6:15)
such as this weekend's Reggie Drago (6:13 - 6:17)
Elite raids they are one of the first (6:15 - 6:20)
steps of our commitment we are working (6:17 - 6:23)
on the following improving raids to make (6:20 - 6:26)
it easier for you to participate in (6:23 - 6:30)
local raid battles that sounds great the (6:26 - 6:33)
ironic stuff is still coming and to (6:30 - 6:34)
become friends with trainers you have (6:33 - 6:37)
battled with enhancements to gameplay (6:34 - 6:39)
experience when you're playing in person (6:37 - 6:42)
with family and friends and new features (6:39 - 6:44)
that provide benefits and encounters (6:42 - 6:48)
with Pokemon while exploring outside (6:44 - 6:48)
um we'll Circle back to this but I that (6:48 - 6:52)
all sounds great thanks Niantic that's (6:50 - 6:54)
not sarcasm that does actually sound (6:52 - 6:55)
good (6:54 - 6:57)
um (6:55 - 6:57)
I mean it sounds like they're starting (6:58 - 7:02)
to move towards trying to make outside (6:59 - 7:04)
play better rather than trying to make (7:02 - 7:06)
inside play worse and I say that while (7:04 - 7:08)
still having full faith they're gonna do (7:06 - 7:10)
the thing and limit remote raid passes (7:08 - 7:12)
at some point but it sounds like they're (7:10 - 7:15)
they're at least (7:12 - 7:18)
uh taking it into account that we want (7:15 - 7:20)
outside play to be better and inside (7:18 - 7:22)
play not to be worse I mean they're (7:20 - 7:24)
saying they're taking into account (7:22 - 7:26)
they've said a lot of things up until (7:24 - 7:29)
this point yeah I know (7:26 - 7:32)
uh their second uh bullet point here is (7:29 - 7:33)
campfire (7:32 - 7:35)
uh last year we launched campfire and (7:33 - 7:37)
select U.S cities campfire's goal is to (7:35 - 7:39)
is for trainers to connect discover (7:37 - 7:43)
local communities and find active nearby (7:39 - 7:45)
raid battles we will continue to improve (7:43 - 7:47)
campfire through the following updates (7:45 - 7:49)
focused on helping trainers communicate (7:47 - 7:51)
and work to tackle raid battles in (7:49 - 7:54)
person you have the ability to start a (7:51 - 7:55)
conversation around pokestops and gyms (7:54 - 7:58)
near you I did try this feature for the (7:55 - 8:00)
record we'll talk about this adding the (7:58 - 8:03)
ability to navigate from campfire to a (8:00 - 8:05)
specific Pokemon go gym campfire will (8:03 - 8:08)
soon uh see updates to significantly (8:05 - 8:11)
improve trainers connect chat and join (8:08 - 8:14)
raid battles together in Pokemon go uh (8:11 - 8:15)
it will continue to roll out for more (8:14 - 8:18)
trainers this year I thought technically (8:15 - 8:22)
it was worldwide but I uh yeah I have (8:18 - 8:25)
never gotten tired of work (8:22 - 8:27)
uh and then their final bullet point (8:25 - 8:30)
here is the community ambassador program (8:27 - 8:34)
uh as another demonstration of our core (8:30 - 8:36)
commitment to proviving providing real (8:34 - 8:38)
world social gameplay We are continuing (8:36 - 8:39)
to grow our community ambassador program (8:38 - 8:42)
this program available in select areas (8:39 - 8:44)
nurtures an in-person Pokemon go (8:42 - 8:46)
communities while also fostering new (8:44 - 8:49)
communities for trainers to find we've (8:46 - 8:51)
added 200 Community ambassadors from (8:49 - 8:53)
around the globe since its launch (8:51 - 8:55)
providing a tool for players to connect (8:53 - 8:57)
with their local bases and unique (8:55 - 9:01)
incentives to encourage local gameplay (8:57 - 9:01)
a lot uh (9:04 - 9:09)
but not actually (9:07 - 9:11)
like saying anything at all saying (9:09 - 9:13)
anything (9:11 - 9:13)
not not committing to anything not (9:13 - 9:18)
saying anything solid yeah some of these (9:15 - 9:20)
are in place though the campfire updates (9:18 - 9:21)
are actually in place and that was nice (9:20 - 9:24)
but we'll get there (9:21 - 9:25)
yeah so (9:24 - 9:28)
um the ironic part here comes with uh (9:25 - 9:30)
Reggie Drago arriving it arrived on (9:28 - 9:33)
Saturday for everyone local time there (9:30 - 9:36)
were three time slots which are 11 2 and (9:33 - 9:38)
5. there were theoretically three times (9:36 - 9:40)
yes (9:38 - 9:43)
if you're unfamiliar with Elite raids (9:40 - 9:45)
and surprisingly a lot of people are (9:43 - 9:47)
unfamiliar with Elite raids this is the (9:45 - 9:49)
second Elite raid Pokemon the first one (9:47 - 9:52)
was Hoopa they did Hoopa twice (9:49 - 9:53)
uh (9:52 - 9:57)
but Elite raids replaced (9:53 - 10:00)
e x raids ex raids (9:57 - 10:03)
um so the the gimmick behind ex raids is (10:00 - 10:05)
it was a specific time that you didn't (10:03 - 10:07)
pick but you showed up at the time that (10:05 - 10:09)
Niantic sent you a little invite you had (10:07 - 10:11)
to be invited in order to get invited (10:09 - 10:14)
you would have to do raids at ex raid (10:11 - 10:16)
gems (10:14 - 10:17)
um which were either sponsored like (10:16 - 10:20)
Sprint at the time or very popular Park (10:17 - 10:23)
ex raids (10:20 - 10:24)
um and then if you were invited what was (10:23 - 10:26)
cool is you could invite somebody else (10:24 - 10:29)
so I could invite Greg if Greg was down (10:26 - 10:30)
the street for me and then Greg and I (10:29 - 10:32)
could go together (10:30 - 10:34)
um that's how they debuted Mewtwo if I (10:32 - 10:37)
remember correctly yeah (10:34 - 10:39)
and so (10:37 - 10:42)
technically Hoopa wasn't new uh you (10:39 - 10:44)
could get Hoopa through the ticket thing (10:42 - 10:46)
the ticketed event or I think they (10:44 - 10:48)
technically gave Hoopa for free but you (10:46 - 10:49)
could pay five dollars to get Hoopa (10:48 - 10:51)
Unbound or something yeah there was the (10:49 - 10:53)
season-long research and I think (10:51 - 10:55)
I don't remember at what point the five (10:53 - 10:58)
dollars came in but it was related for (10:55 - 11:01)
five dollars give us five bucks (10:58 - 11:03)
I think it was if you if you didn't keep (11:01 - 11:05)
up with the research Maybe (11:03 - 11:07)
so Reggie Drago and Reggie eleke are (11:05 - 11:10)
supposed to be in the elite raids uh uh (11:07 - 11:12)
Reggie Drago went first and of course to (11:10 - 11:15)
no one's surprise it did not work in New (11:12 - 11:17)
Zealand (11:15 - 11:18)
um (11:17 - 11:20)
what was happening is people could see (11:18 - 11:23)
Reggie Drago they could not connect (11:20 - 11:24)
um if they did get in they would get (11:23 - 11:26)
kicked from The Raid some people (11:24 - 11:27)
couldn't finish the raid because Reggie (11:26 - 11:30)
Drago had pretty much a an unlimited (11:27 - 11:34)
Focus Sash and it just stayed at what I (11:30 - 11:36)
see forever (11:34 - 11:36)
for them being on the always on The (11:37 - 11:42)
Cutting Edge of the time zones (11:39 - 11:42)
yeah I mean (11:43 - 11:47)
they they they got to make sure they got (11:44 - 11:48)
a solid hour of testing for their real (11:47 - 11:50)
money-making country Japan which is (11:48 - 11:52)
correct (11:50 - 11:55)
um Japan and Australia had issues I (11:52 - 11:57)
didn't hear of that many issues in the (11:55 - 11:58)
UK which would have gone technically (11:57 - 12:00)
after that um yeah I think it went (11:58 - 12:01)
smoothly there (12:00 - 12:05)
uh and then all those time zones (12:01 - 12:08)
and then it came to the U.S and I woke (12:05 - 12:12)
up to Eastern people having issues and (12:08 - 12:15)
then I was like okay so I did it we'll (12:12 - 12:17)
get to that as well (12:15 - 12:19)
um I had no issues uh I there was about (12:17 - 12:22)
35 people in my group and we walked past (12:19 - 12:25)
another group of 20 who I guess didn't (12:22 - 12:27)
get the memo and they started at a (12:25 - 12:29)
different gym and we swapped places (12:27 - 12:30)
um (12:29 - 12:33)
and didn't seem like they had any issues (12:30 - 12:35)
um and then I heard after that a bunch (12:33 - 12:39)
of more issues existed by the time all (12:35 - 12:41)
of those issues were complaining Niantic (12:39 - 12:44)
was giving New Zealand another makeup (12:41 - 12:47)
day which would have been Sunday and (12:44 - 12:50)
they had the same issues on Sunday that (12:47 - 12:53)
they did Saturday it was still broken so (12:50 - 12:55)
that they think they couldn't do it (12:53 - 12:57)
again (12:55 - 12:57)
yep (12:58 - 13:01)
and no news since then (13:01 - 13:06)
no updates how (13:03 - 13:12)
I don't know how how how how how are you (13:06 - 13:15)
this bad because you're saying how how (13:12 - 13:19)
how do people still (13:15 - 13:22)
tolerated that's the thing I don't (13:19 - 13:25)
understand I don't get it how (13:22 - 13:28)
I don't get from a copy and paste (13:25 - 13:31)
perspective how raids have existed so (13:28 - 13:32)
long (13:31 - 13:35)
and this isn't the first Elite raid and (13:32 - 13:37)
this isn't even the first like (13:35 - 13:39)
time they've done a Time specific grade (13:37 - 13:44)
they've done like I don't so I I just (13:39 - 13:46)
like I get there are different types of (13:44 - 13:48)
phones there's different types of (13:46 - 13:49)
operating systems right you have Android (13:48 - 13:52)
you have IOS you have you know people (13:49 - 13:54)
that are on dreamsicle and KitKat and (13:52 - 13:56)
Twix and Snickers and whatever other (13:54 - 14:00)
Android devices Android like I get there (13:56 - 14:01)
a different operating systems okay (14:00 - 14:03)
here's like I used to have to deal with (14:01 - 14:06)
call center people and the fact that we (14:03 - 14:09)
had to include in our simulations always (14:06 - 14:13)
ask them what candy drove me up a wall (14:09 - 14:17)
because it's the dumbest naming scheme (14:13 - 14:19)
because it doesn't make sense but it's (14:17 - 14:21)
alphabetical it doesn't make sense (14:19 - 14:23)
though yeah the candy is an alcoholic it (14:21 - 14:25)
still doesn't make sense (14:23 - 14:28)
how how okay you then just use the (14:25 - 14:31)
alphabet how does that make it better (14:28 - 14:34)
that it's alphabetical candy (14:31 - 14:36)
people are going to remember it more (14:34 - 14:39)
though I wouldn't remember (14:36 - 14:39)
I would remember if I was on 30 years of (14:39 - 14:45)
experiencing system Oreo they do not (14:43 - 14:49)
remember the candy because they have no (14:45 - 14:54)
basis to tie it to reality (14:49 - 14:54)
we need to talk about that (14:55 - 14:59)
okay (15:02 - 15:05)
um (15:06 - 15:10)
okay here okay we got let's go so going (15:07 - 15:12)
back to our commitment the whole ironic (15:10 - 15:14)
thing is they talked about how they're (15:12 - 15:16)
improving in person they want it to be (15:14 - 15:18)
easier they want you to have a better (15:16 - 15:21)
experience obviously none of this (15:18 - 15:25)
it happened in some time zones my time (15:21 - 15:26)
zone I am West Coast and it was (15:25 - 15:29)
completely smooth and I got to meet up (15:26 - 15:31)
with old raid groups I hadn't seen in (15:29 - 15:33)
years and it was really great I was also (15:31 - 15:36)
with a group of 35-ish people we even (15:33 - 15:38)
used some of the new campfire features (15:36 - 15:41)
and met up with more people and I ended (15:38 - 15:43)
the day with four different Reggie (15:41 - 15:45)
dragos so I have some to trade to people (15:43 - 15:47)
who had issues at some point or I didn't (15:45 - 15:49)
do it or weren't able to make it it was (15:47 - 15:54)
miserable yeah it was so ugly for most (15:49 - 15:55)
of the day yesterday right you're gonna (15:54 - 15:56)
have to you're gonna have to start (15:55 - 15:58)
opening or sending gifts if you want to (15:56 - 16:01)
trade a legendary Pokemon with me look (15:58 - 16:06)
Greg gets his legendary Pokemon for me (16:01 - 16:06)
I here's the thing my motto with Pokemon (16:06 - 16:11)
go is I'll get it (16:09 - 16:12)
eventually (16:11 - 16:14)
when they don't care anymore and they're (16:12 - 16:16)
like just sham it because we need to do (16:14 - 16:19)
something this weekend I'll get it then (16:16 - 16:22)
mm-hmm okay so the things that Niantic (16:19 - 16:25)
did say reading this whole blog post (16:22 - 16:26)
they're saying they're going to make (16:25 - 16:29)
campfire better they're gonna say that (16:26 - 16:30)
that goes to their first point of (16:29 - 16:32)
improving raids to make it easier for (16:30 - 16:34)
you to participate in local rates and (16:32 - 16:37)
become so it looks like a couple things (16:34 - 16:38)
here it looks like that they're going to (16:37 - 16:40)
add a feature where after you do a raid (16:38 - 16:42)
with a bunch of random people you would (16:40 - 16:45)
have the option to add them as a friend (16:42 - 16:47)
after the battle that's my take away (16:45 - 16:48)
from that first sentence (16:47 - 16:51)
um which is like common in in like MMOs (16:48 - 16:53)
right like you rated with a bunch of (16:51 - 16:54)
random people at the end it's like do (16:53 - 16:55)
you want to add this person as a friend (16:54 - 16:57)
Pokemon unite loves to do this like that (16:55 - 16:59)
person that just carried you you want to (16:57 - 17:00)
add them as a friend of course they're (16:59 - 17:02)
gonna say no because they're like ah I (17:00 - 17:03)
gotta I had to carry that person through (17:02 - 17:04)
this bad match I don't want to add them (17:03 - 17:05)
as a friend (17:04 - 17:09)
um so if ideally you know you raid with (17:05 - 17:11)
a bunch of random people locally (17:09 - 17:15)
uh we would hope or what Niantic is uh I (17:11 - 17:17)
guess saying here is you'll be able to (17:15 - 17:19)
add them and then once you add somebody (17:17 - 17:21)
as a friend technically in campfire you (17:19 - 17:25)
are able to then to DM them so after (17:21 - 17:27)
seven years of this video game you have (17:25 - 17:30)
some form of you're going to have some (17:27 - 17:32)
form of communication to be like (17:30 - 17:34)
if they have campfire and if they've (17:32 - 17:36)
opened it somewhat recently so they (17:34 - 17:38)
actually get the notifications right (17:36 - 17:40)
there's still ifs there there are still (17:38 - 17:43)
ifs but before there was nothing so (17:40 - 17:46)
there's stuff down here before there was (17:43 - 17:48)
nothing and now there could be something (17:46 - 17:51)
there could be something yes (17:48 - 17:52)
uh (17:51 - 17:54)
and then they're they're saying they're (17:52 - 17:56)
going to enhance the game experience (17:54 - 17:57)
when playing with family and friends uh (17:56 - 17:59)
I'm assuming that this is just more (17:57 - 18:01)
rewards for playing with people on your (17:59 - 18:03)
friends list that would be my my guess (18:01 - 18:04)
or my takeaway (18:03 - 18:07)
which would then piggyback off like we (18:04 - 18:09)
want you to add people and then new (18:07 - 18:11)
features and benefits uh new benefits (18:09 - 18:12)
and encounters (18:11 - 18:14)
with more Pokemon while exploring (18:12 - 18:16)
outside so that's the make make the (18:14 - 18:18)
outside experience better don't Nerf the (18:16 - 18:20)
at-home experience (18:18 - 18:21)
obviously none of that happened with (18:20 - 18:24)
Reggie Drago uh Greg and I were supposed (18:21 - 18:25)
to do Reggie Drago (18:24 - 18:30)
uh and what the time was not an issue (18:25 - 18:33)
like it was like well we we just we just (18:30 - 18:35)
need to figure out where to go now you (18:33 - 18:37)
guys might for people listening to (18:35 - 18:39)
podcasts you all would be like well (18:37 - 18:40)
Steve you always talk about how Great (18:39 - 18:42)
Mall of America is why don't you just (18:40 - 18:44)
just go to Mall of America you're 100 (18:42 - 18:47)
right but for whatever reason (18:44 - 18:49)
even though Mall of America has two to (18:47 - 18:52)
three ex-raid gyms (18:49 - 18:56)
nothing refuses to like Hoopa Reggie (18:52 - 18:58)
Drago nothing will spawn there so I (18:56 - 19:03)
don't know if it's like a must be a park (18:58 - 19:04)
okay (19:03 - 19:06)
cat's here (19:04 - 19:08)
uh I don't know if if it's like a check (19:06 - 19:12)
box of must be Park and must be ex-ray (19:08 - 19:15)
gym because when I look at campus x-ray (19:12 - 19:16)
gyms were supposed to be in parks to (19:15 - 19:18)
begin with (19:16 - 19:21)
for the most part parks are sponsored (19:18 - 19:23)
stuff yeah so I think one of the ex (19:21 - 19:26)
regions probably it is uh like the (19:23 - 19:29)
Starbucks ex-raid gems in the mall are (19:26 - 19:30)
the sponsored ones that's probably why (19:29 - 19:32)
they're not getting it (19:30 - 19:35)
oh yeah I I I'll I'll go re-look but I (19:32 - 19:36)
know what for sure one is like a (19:35 - 19:38)
Starbucks and then the other one is like (19:36 - 19:40)
a theater stand or something they're (19:38 - 19:43)
ignoring that there's an amusement park (19:40 - 19:46)
in Mall of America that's true they're (19:43 - 19:49)
fake trees a lot of real trees those are (19:46 - 19:51)
real trees you know what's weird about (19:49 - 19:53)
mall America is the third floor is (19:51 - 19:54)
dramatically different than the first (19:53 - 19:56)
one yeah the first floor you're like man (19:54 - 19:58)
there's trees and water where am I yeah (19:56 - 20:02)
but that's how they keep the air clean (19:58 - 20:06)
oh so the easy solution would to be go (20:02 - 20:08)
to mall America don't worry because (20:06 - 20:10)
people who have no clue what's happening (20:08 - 20:12)
would still jump into the raid because (20:10 - 20:15)
there's just thousands of people there (20:12 - 20:16)
constantly (20:15 - 20:19)
um so I'm looking at the map on campfire (20:16 - 20:21)
I'm actually like panicking I'm like I'm (20:19 - 20:25)
like I really want Reggie Drago and I (20:21 - 20:26)
need this to work because if I can't get (20:25 - 20:29)
this to work I got even more depression (20:26 - 20:31)
when Ellie key comes so I need this has (20:29 - 20:33)
to be the test run right like I need to (20:31 - 20:35)
figure so I'm like looking in I'm (20:33 - 20:37)
looking at the like all the places I've (20:35 - 20:39)
streamed Pokemon go places Greg has (20:37 - 20:41)
taken me like Silver Park silver silver (20:39 - 20:43)
bullet Park (20:41 - 20:46)
um Downtown Minneapolis uh Centennial (20:43 - 20:47)
Lake I'm like looking and I'm like okay (20:46 - 20:50)
well there are I'm thinking like okay (20:47 - 20:52)
well most pokemon go players if they do (20:50 - 20:53)
want to leave they don't want to leave (20:52 - 20:55)
for one raid they want to at least do (20:53 - 20:56)
like two or three and they want it to be (20:55 - 20:58)
in walking distance and I'm like okay (20:56 - 21:00)
maybe over here (20:58 - 21:02)
so then I'm thinking like okay well how (21:00 - 21:04)
many people need to do Reggie Drago I (21:02 - 21:06)
was like well I can grab Greg and will (21:04 - 21:08)
and me that's three I can maybe grab one (21:06 - 21:09)
or two other people that we play (21:08 - 21:11)
Community Day with that's five is that (21:09 - 21:13)
enough (21:11 - 21:15)
um (21:13 - 21:15)
and then I'm like ah but what if well (21:15 - 21:19)
see this wouldn't work because will had (21:17 - 21:21)
car trouble so like that again you know (21:19 - 21:23)
if you plan all this and then one person (21:21 - 21:24)
has car trouble you're like all right (21:23 - 21:25)
now I'm down one (21:24 - 21:28)
so so I'm like then I did the thing that (21:25 - 21:32)
I hated is I Googled Reddit Pokemon Go (21:28 - 21:35)
Minneapolis (21:32 - 21:37)
and I found a bunch of subreddits and (21:35 - 21:39)
none of them have been posted in like (21:37 - 21:41)
six eight nine months and I was like (21:39 - 21:43)
okay and then I'm like I'm not going to (21:41 - 21:47)
Facebook that that is the last that I (21:43 - 21:50)
who did go to Facebook for you also I (21:47 - 21:53)
told you there were going to be two (21:50 - 21:56)
possible locations and the most likely (21:53 - 21:58)
with Centennial Lakes I told you you (21:56 - 22:01)
were right the most likely spot if it's (21:58 - 22:02)
not going to be at the Mall of America (22:01 - 22:05)
was Centennial like because it's got a (22:02 - 22:07)
park but you can kind of still be inside (22:05 - 22:10)
in any of the stores around there and (22:07 - 22:12)
you don't have to be out in the cold (22:10 - 22:17)
yes so so Greg sent me a Discord I did (22:12 - 22:18)
and I was like I don't know how I don't (22:17 - 22:21)
know how he got this I'm clever (22:18 - 22:23)
are you so is it more of the local (22:21 - 22:26)
Pokemon groups than Steve is well I mean (22:23 - 22:29)
sort of in the fact that no local (22:26 - 22:30)
Pokemon groups to the record I left them (22:29 - 22:34)
all when I moved to the state I I am in (22:30 - 22:37)
a lot of things for a lot of Minneapolis (22:34 - 22:40)
Minnesota stuff mostly gay stuff but (22:37 - 22:42)
occasionally I decide to tip my toe over (22:40 - 22:45)
into the normies straighties areas to (22:42 - 22:47)
see what they're up to just so that I'm (22:45 - 22:50)
prepared uh as I do to be in a Discord (22:47 - 22:53)
and pay no attention to it uh yeah I (22:50 - 22:54)
also have discords that I just like mute (22:53 - 22:57)
I never want to hear from you I'll go in (22:54 - 22:59)
there when I need something (22:57 - 22:59)
so Greg sent me a Discord it was the (23:00 - 23:05)
Minnesota Discord and in that Discord (23:02 - 23:09)
was 300 other discords like narrowing (23:05 - 23:10)
down where in Minnesota like do you want (23:09 - 23:13)
like Duluth do you want the do you want (23:10 - 23:15)
Saint Paul do you want downtown do you (23:13 - 23:17)
want downtown St Paul do you want (23:15 - 23:18)
Downtown Minneapolis do you want North (23:17 - 23:21)
Minneapolis North so I'm like going (23:18 - 23:23)
through and I'm like this is a nightmare (23:21 - 23:26)
this like I like this is a Discord for a (23:23 - 23:27)
Discord which is which was like the (23:26 - 23:30)
Milwaukee problem which was like when I (23:27 - 23:32)
would raid locally in Milwaukee people (23:30 - 23:34)
would be like are you in the Discord I'm (23:32 - 23:35)
like yeah I'm in this Discord and (23:34 - 23:38)
they're like oh no yeah that Discord but (23:35 - 23:41)
you got to be in the the Discord in the (23:38 - 23:43)
Discord that's like the the this the (23:41 - 23:45)
Discord we all use I'm like no I'm not (23:43 - 23:47)
I'm not in the private secret Discord (23:45 - 23:50)
like I'm in the I'm in the Discord like (23:47 - 23:52)
I don't want to be in the private (23:50 - 23:55)
Discord inside the Discord so I click on (23:52 - 23:57)
two discords I clicked on the Centennial (23:55 - 23:58)
likes Discord and I clicked on the (23:57 - 23:59)
downtown (23:58 - 24:02)
Minneapolis Discord Downtown Minneapolis (23:59 - 24:04)
Discord no posts and foremost well (24:02 - 24:05)
nobody works down there anymore well hey (24:04 - 24:07)
nobody lives in Downtown Minneapolis and (24:05 - 24:11)
B nobody's worked down there since covid (24:07 - 24:14)
so no post in four months so when I (24:11 - 24:16)
clicked on those Centennial Lakes (24:14 - 24:17)
Discord (24:16 - 24:20)
um which is in Edina uh there was like (24:17 - 24:21)
three or four people talking about (24:20 - 24:23)
Reggie Drago and I was like all right (24:21 - 24:25)
well we're talking we're talking about (24:23 - 24:28)
Drago before I got here and then people (24:25 - 24:29)
were saying they were going to this (24:28 - 24:32)
specific spot I was like great (24:29 - 24:32)
um (24:32 - 24:35)
as the night went on more and more (24:32 - 24:36)
people were talking about Reggie Drago (24:35 - 24:39)
uh it seemed like before I went to bed (24:36 - 24:42)
at least seven people were showing up uh (24:39 - 24:45)
at 11 A.M for the two and then when I (24:42 - 24:48)
woke up it seemed like 15 people were (24:45 - 24:50)
gonna show up and when I got there uh (24:48 - 24:52)
there was 35 people (24:50 - 24:54)
about 35 people because we ended up (24:52 - 24:57)
doing two raids of 20 and the second one (24:54 - 24:59)
didn't fill fully (24:57 - 24:59)
um (24:59 - 25:02)
but uh also like (24:59 - 25:04)
the the small issue is I'm like sitting (25:02 - 25:06)
in the parking lot because I'm there (25:04 - 25:07)
early (25:06 - 25:09)
uh I'm there 10 minutes early (25:07 - 25:12)
uh and I'm sitting in between the two 11 (25:09 - 25:13)
o'clock (25:12 - 25:17)
raids and I I use campfire (25:13 - 25:20)
to like see and I see there are way more (25:17 - 25:23)
flares on the one that we didn't talk (25:20 - 25:26)
about in the Discord oh no (25:23 - 25:28)
and so I go back to the Discord and I'm (25:26 - 25:30)
just reading everything and everyone's (25:28 - 25:31)
still saying they're going to the other (25:30 - 25:33)
one I was like okay and I was like well (25:31 - 25:35)
I guess I'm getting on my car early (25:33 - 25:37)
because like I want I don't you right (25:35 - 25:39)
you don't want to walk to the one that's (25:37 - 25:41)
wrong and then all of a sudden (25:39 - 25:45)
everyone did the other one and you (25:41 - 25:47)
missed out right so I walk over there (25:45 - 25:49)
there are there is a bunch of people (25:47 - 25:50)
there it was by a coffee shop so (25:49 - 25:51)
everyone was getting coffee that was (25:50 - 25:53)
very convenient nice (25:51 - 25:54)
um and everyone ended up doing the right (25:53 - 25:56)
in the coffee shop but the coffee people (25:54 - 25:58)
were like hey I do the raid because they (25:56 - 26:00)
were yeah just buy seriously (25:58 - 26:03)
yeah they install a lot of coffees very (26:00 - 26:04)
shortly (26:03 - 26:05)
um and then when we walked the other one (26:04 - 26:08)
which had the more flares on it (26:05 - 26:10)
um there was a group of like 20 people (26:08 - 26:13)
that I I want weren't in the Discord (26:10 - 26:15)
didn't get the memo they maybe they're (26:13 - 26:17)
in a different Discord or a Facebook (26:15 - 26:21)
group and we all switched places (26:17 - 26:21)
um (26:21 - 26:24)
it very much was (26:21 - 26:28)
the thing that I think post pre that (26:24 - 26:31)
pre-covered people remember which was (26:28 - 26:33)
this (26:31 - 26:37)
very sloppy bad communication of people (26:33 - 26:39)
trying to get together to do a raid and (26:37 - 26:40)
then everyone shows up and you could (26:39 - 26:42)
tell that there were people that knew (26:40 - 26:43)
each other and other people that don't (26:42 - 26:45)
talk to anyone which is me (26:43 - 26:46)
um (26:45 - 26:49)
it was fine like I I didn't make any new (26:46 - 26:51)
friends Niantic like (26:49 - 26:53)
the one of the (26:51 - 26:56)
so if you did Reggie draga you got like (26:53 - 26:57)
a special Quest (26:56 - 27:00)
which was just make a friend that's was (26:57 - 27:02)
the question it was a candy you got this (27:00 - 27:05)
right Hannah and I think that the the (27:02 - 27:08)
the concept was oh you're here with that (27:05 - 27:10)
parade right yeah you're here with (27:08 - 27:12)
people to add and there was like a small (27:10 - 27:15)
I was almost ready to ask somebody and (27:12 - 27:17)
then I was like it's too cold I'll just (27:15 - 27:20)
post on Twitter when I get back to my (27:17 - 27:21)
car it's fine (27:20 - 27:24)
yeah I there were definitely people in (27:21 - 27:26)
my group that there were people on the (27:24 - 27:27)
far outskirts who definitely rated from (27:26 - 27:30)
like a block away but then came in and (27:27 - 27:32)
really quietly asked to be friends with (27:30 - 27:34)
somebody and then really quietly became (27:32 - 27:36)
friends with somebody and left so they (27:34 - 27:40)
succeeded for some people at least yeah (27:36 - 27:42)
I think it was a good you know when (27:40 - 27:44)
people are like my local community is (27:42 - 27:46)
dead Niantic fix it there's only so much (27:44 - 27:50)
Niantic can do right yeah so I think (27:46 - 27:54)
making campfire better and giving you a (27:50 - 27:56)
reason to try to go back outside and (27:54 - 27:58)
then the little like hey here's your (27:56 - 28:00)
quest add a friend like try to build (27:58 - 28:02)
your community like I think there was (28:00 - 28:04)
there was some thoughtfulness put into (28:02 - 28:06)
that of course people are awkward and (28:04 - 28:08)
and social interactions can be tough (28:06 - 28:10)
sometimes so you know (28:08 - 28:12)
that's not that's normal and also it's (28:10 - 28:15)
and and freezing out (28:12 - 28:16)
it's helping you with snow it's not the (28:15 - 28:19)
best time of year and one other thing (28:16 - 28:22)
just as we're talking about campfire (28:19 - 28:22)
there were theoretically three time (28:23 - 28:29)
slots for this raid yes but almost all (28:25 - 28:31)
of them were 11 o'clock and not (28:29 - 28:34)
everybody could do 11 o'clock and after (28:31 - 28:36)
11 o'clock if you were looking for any (28:34 - 28:38)
more raids at least in my city you had (28:36 - 28:42)
to look everywhere the only two o'clock (28:38 - 28:43)
five o'clock raids were in the very (28:42 - 28:46)
outskirts of the city and one of the (28:43 - 28:47)
things I'm hoping maybe they will (28:46 - 28:51)
Implement in campfire someday is a way (28:47 - 28:53)
to search for the raids you're looking (28:51 - 28:55)
for because I couldn't find the two (28:53 - 28:57)
o'clock raids and we only barely found (28:55 - 28:59)
one that we could make it to and then (28:57 - 29:01)
only barely found another that we can (28:59 - 29:04)
make it to and I'm not sure I found more (29:01 - 29:06)
than one five o'clock raid in my entire (29:04 - 29:07)
city (29:06 - 29:08)
so (29:07 - 29:10)
something was up there I feel like with (29:08 - 29:12)
the Hooper raids I heard they were more (29:10 - 29:14)
balanced (29:12 - 29:17)
I didn't have the issue of not seeing a (29:14 - 29:19)
lot of five o'clocks I saw plenty of (29:17 - 29:21)
five o'clocks I had the issue where no (29:19 - 29:24)
one cared about five o'clock yeah like (29:21 - 29:26)
in a Discord it was (29:24 - 29:29)
needed you only ultimately needed three (29:26 - 29:32)
people for this raid if you had strong (29:29 - 29:35)
players it was not nearly as hard as say (29:32 - 29:38)
a Mewtwo when Mewtwo was any X rates (29:35 - 29:41)
well Hoopa seemed like you needed nine (29:38 - 29:44)
like eight to nine for Hoopa okay (29:41 - 29:48)
um Hoopa seemed much much tougher from (29:44 - 29:50)
well Hoopa was also only weak to like or (29:48 - 29:53)
super week two it's like bug and it's (29:50 - 29:56)
definitely bug because it's psychic dark (29:53 - 29:58)
bug in something else it's weak too so (29:56 - 30:01)
like at the time I don't I think we just (29:58 - 30:03)
got mega Scizor (30:01 - 30:06)
um but (30:03 - 30:08)
but like (30:06 - 30:11)
again just like Niantic sends this (30:08 - 30:13)
message of like for we want to make the (30:11 - 30:15)
in-person stuff better and they had (30:13 - 30:19)
possibly one of the worst (30:15 - 30:20)
event (30:19 - 30:24)
for a lot of time zones (30:20 - 30:26)
I want to keep saying I had a really (30:24 - 30:28)
good experience with it my time zone (30:26 - 30:31)
went smoothly people showed up who were (30:28 - 30:32)
in communities that hadn't come together (30:31 - 30:34)
in a while one person even brought a (30:32 - 30:36)
switch and was letting people transfer (30:34 - 30:38)
postcards in so that they could get (30:36 - 30:40)
gimme ghoul so a ton of people got gimme (30:38 - 30:44)
gold for the first time my my Raid event (30:40 - 30:47)
went very smoothly and very well yes but (30:44 - 30:48)
it definitely did not (30:47 - 30:52)
in a lot of places but I ca I I cannot (30:48 - 30:55)
imagine showing up with like I feel so (30:52 - 30:57)
bad because I I get it I cannot imagine (30:55 - 30:59)
showing up with like 20 people at 11 (30:57 - 31:02)
o'clock nothing works the like half hour (30:59 - 31:04)
of defeat (31:02 - 31:08)
is awful it sucks and then you know I (31:04 - 31:10)
I've been I I could imagine all those 20 (31:08 - 31:12)
people were like okay well you know (31:10 - 31:14)
we're New Zealand or you know we're one (31:12 - 31:16)
of the early time zones uh I guess we'll (31:14 - 31:18)
see you guys in three hours at two (31:16 - 31:19)
o'clock (31:18 - 31:21)
because at least you can organize when (31:19 - 31:22)
you're all there in person to be like (31:21 - 31:24)
are we all coming back at two and most (31:22 - 31:25)
of the people probably gonna say yeah (31:24 - 31:26)
other people are probably gonna be like (31:25 - 31:28)
no this is my only time zone (31:26 - 31:32)
and then to come back to that same issue (31:28 - 31:34)
and then (31:32 - 31:36)
Niantic is like okay tomorrow (31:34 - 31:38)
and then to show up all again and to (31:36 - 31:41)
come back in the same issue like just (31:38 - 31:45)
The Dominoes of destroying people's (31:41 - 31:48)
confidence Faith like wasting their time (31:45 - 31:50)
it's like a waste of the time it's (31:48 - 31:52)
already bad like (31:50 - 31:55)
when you do it at 11 I already feel like (31:52 - 31:57)
the hardcore players are the ones that (31:55 - 31:58)
go out right away right so you're (31:57 - 32:00)
getting like yep the 11 o'clock and then (31:58 - 32:02)
you're getting the hardcore people that (32:00 - 32:03)
can like okay well I can't do lovings (32:02 - 32:05)
too at least I got whatever I'll do it (32:03 - 32:07)
at two and so then you have a five (32:05 - 32:10)
o'clock time frame where it's like this (32:08 - 32:13)
is a wasteland of people because it's (32:10 - 32:15)
five o'clock on a Saturday and it's also (32:13 - 32:17)
just a weird time but then to have none (32:15 - 32:18)
of those work (32:17 - 32:21)
and then be like we're gonna come back (32:18 - 32:23)
tomorrow (32:21 - 32:25)
those are (32:23 - 32:29)
deal breaking things for me as a video (32:25 - 32:33)
game player those are uh you do not (32:29 - 32:35)
respect my time (32:33 - 32:39)
I cannot keep doing this I cannot set (32:35 - 32:41)
aside (32:39 - 32:43)
two-fold days (32:41 - 32:46)
in essence because you have to be there (32:43 - 32:47)
and then you have to leave and you're (32:46 - 32:48)
like okay well I have to do something (32:47 - 32:50)
within these three hours which means I (32:48 - 32:53)
can't really pick up my life again (32:50 - 32:55)
because I I have to do something like (32:53 - 32:56)
I'll go shopping or I'm just gonna go (32:55 - 32:59)
sit at home and then drive back out and (32:56 - 33:01)
who knows how far that drive was I mean (32:59 - 33:04)
these are these would be me saying I am (33:01 - 33:07)
done with this game I am done we're done (33:04 - 33:09)
and the other problem that that isn't (33:07 - 33:11)
really talked about is you have the (33:09 - 33:13)
people who successfully did it (33:11 - 33:15)
like myself or Hannah (33:13 - 33:18)
and I I like Reggie Drago's gonna come (33:15 - 33:20)
back let's just say Reggie Drago comes (33:18 - 33:21)
back next week (33:20 - 33:25)
I don't have an incentive to do it again (33:21 - 33:29)
yeah and and even if like half the (33:25 - 33:31)
people that did it (33:29 - 33:34)
they they got one they got two they got (33:31 - 33:38)
you know three stars like (33:34 - 33:38)
you already don't have your entire (33:39 - 33:43)
player base committed to this you you (33:41 - 33:45)
convince some of your player base to do (33:43 - 33:48)
it some of the player base got it so (33:45 - 33:49)
what's the likelihood of that player (33:48 - 33:51)
base going back out so it's like every (33:49 - 33:53)
time it comes back around it's just a (33:51 - 33:55)
smaller pool of people it's more (33:53 - 33:57)
difficult to plan if it was a (33:55 - 34:00)
competitively or any other way useful (33:57 - 34:02)
Pokemon people might go out and raid (34:00 - 34:05)
more the only reason I went out to the (34:02 - 34:07)
second round at 2PM was because somebody (34:05 - 34:09)
in my group wasn't able to catch either (34:07 - 34:11)
one that we went against in the first (34:09 - 34:14)
round they both ran from her I I wanted (34:11 - 34:16)
to talk about that too I didn't think (34:14 - 34:20)
about that until uh I was there I got 22 (34:16 - 34:22)
pokeballs to catch Reggie Drago which is (34:20 - 34:24)
a lot of pokeballs uh both times it took (34:22 - 34:26)
over 10 Pokeballs and I'm it was farther (34:24 - 34:27)
away than you thought it was going to be (34:26 - 34:30)
golden Raz great excellence (34:27 - 34:33)
I cannot imagine (34:30 - 34:33)
again this this is like a small set of (34:33 - 34:37)
players but like I can't imagine being (34:35 - 34:38)
like okay I only have time to do one (34:37 - 34:41)
Reggie Drago I woke up at 11. I drove (34:38 - 34:43)
out here like even if you lived in a (34:41 - 34:46)
city where only had one e not ex raid um (34:43 - 34:48)
Elite raid (34:46 - 34:49)
and you did the work you did what (34:48 - 34:51)
Niantic wanted you to you woke up you (34:49 - 34:54)
got to your one Elite raid other people (34:51 - 34:56)
showed up and then you didn't catch it (34:54 - 34:59)
like that also kind of sucks yeah it's a (34:56 - 35:03)
lot I I still fundamentally question at (34:59 - 35:06)
this point in our game lives (35:03 - 35:10)
what are catch rates getting us (35:06 - 35:10)
what the what how is it how how is that (35:12 - 35:17)
a fun (35:16 - 35:20)
mechanic and not just a ball face we (35:17 - 35:23)
need to use our economy better so we (35:20 - 35:25)
need you to waste Pokeballs (35:23 - 35:28)
particularly in raids (35:25 - 35:31)
and particularly in limited time rates (35:28 - 35:33)
like these I think I definitely agree I (35:31 - 35:36)
know that that (35:33 - 35:38)
event where we were able to use Beast (35:36 - 35:40)
balls on the ultra beasts everyone was (35:38 - 35:42)
super excited about because we didn't (35:40 - 35:45)
have to worry about the catch rates at (35:42 - 35:47)
all yeah there (35:45 - 35:49)
I think it could still technically fail (35:47 - 35:51)
but because the catch rate was so high (35:49 - 35:53)
because you had so many pokeballs yeah (35:51 - 35:54)
yeah (35:53 - 35:56)
I mean my problem right now like my (35:54 - 35:59)
problem with catch rate or like the raid (35:56 - 36:01)
system is like (35:59 - 36:03)
I don't really care if I don't catch it (36:01 - 36:05)
like maybe if it was like a perfect IV (36:03 - 36:07)
and I failed to catch it like I would (36:05 - 36:08)
feel like bad but also if it was perfect (36:07 - 36:11)
IV I would be like more focused on like (36:08 - 36:13)
making sure I just play a little bit (36:11 - 36:16)
slower and stuff it's just it is the (36:13 - 36:19)
worst feeling in the world to throw 22 (36:16 - 36:21)
Pokeballs and not catch something (36:19 - 36:25)
because it's so time consuming like I (36:21 - 36:27)
would rather them say like okay catch (36:25 - 36:30)
rate is uh 25 because like I think with (36:27 - 36:32)
a Pokeball it's like closer to like six (36:30 - 36:35)
or seven percent but you you only get (36:32 - 36:36)
three pokeballs I'd be like that's way (36:35 - 36:38)
better because at least I'm not wasting (36:36 - 36:40)
like 10 minutes at least I know that (36:38 - 36:42)
like okay I didn't get it all right no (36:40 - 36:44)
big deal on to the next one like it (36:42 - 36:45)
sucks (36:44 - 36:48)
I've done um raid hours (36:45 - 36:49)
every Wednesday night at Mall of America (36:48 - 36:52)
for the last month just because they're (36:49 - 36:54)
Pokemon that I don't have is shiny and (36:52 - 36:55)
it's just like (36:54 - 36:58)
catching trying to keep up with the (36:55 - 37:00)
group because again Mall of America you (36:58 - 37:02)
know there's three floors you have no (37:00 - 37:04)
clue where people are but like you jump (37:02 - 37:06)
in and you kind of figure like oh (37:04 - 37:07)
they're moving this way of like well I (37:06 - 37:09)
gotta like throw as fast like I if I (37:07 - 37:11)
don't get in the group then it's gonna (37:09 - 37:12)
be like five people instead of 20 people (37:11 - 37:14)
and that's going to take longer to do (37:12 - 37:16)
the raid and I'm gonna be like I don't (37:14 - 37:19)
want to spend 15 minutes throwing 22 (37:16 - 37:21)
pokeballs for the game to be like up you (37:19 - 37:22)
didn't get it like there are so many (37:21 - 37:24)
times when we're at a Mall of America (37:22 - 37:26)
where we're like I'm still trying to (37:24 - 37:29)
catch this we can't move forward yet I'm (37:26 - 37:33)
still yeah on this lengthy lengthy (37:29 - 37:35)
lengthy screen (37:33 - 37:37)
and (37:35 - 37:40)
I at the end I wasted 20 minutes I (37:37 - 37:42)
didn't get it (37:40 - 37:45)
fun (37:42 - 37:45)
and we are saying these as players who (37:46 - 37:50)
know how to throw the Pokeball in (37:49 - 37:52)
Pokemon go have access to Ultra Balls (37:50 - 37:55)
have golden raspberries probably have at (37:52 - 37:58)
least a gold Badge of the types that (37:55 - 38:00)
we're catching so that boosts the catch (37:58 - 38:01)
rate too (38:00 - 38:03)
and even when (38:01 - 38:06)
uh the catch rate formula is tricky (38:03 - 38:08)
there's the theory that as you go (38:06 - 38:11)
farther along the catch rate goes up and (38:08 - 38:13)
as you have fewer and fewer pokeballs (38:11 - 38:15)
left the catch rate goes up that hasn't (38:13 - 38:16)
been confirmed (38:15 - 38:20)
but we know how to do this we have all (38:16 - 38:22)
of the bonuses that make it as easy as (38:20 - 38:24)
it possibly could be and we are still (38:22 - 38:26)
having a hard time it's the same it's (38:24 - 38:29)
why it's I did the Hitmonlee Hitmonchan (38:26 - 38:32)
with Greg and the the problem with that (38:29 - 38:34)
event was the catch rate oh it was like (38:32 - 38:37)
I've I frustrated and excellent on (38:34 - 38:41)
Hitmonlee every single time (38:37 - 38:44)
but like gold oh not golden Rez well at (38:41 - 38:45)
a certain point I was golden Rising (38:44 - 38:46)
hitmonleeves because I was like I just (38:45 - 38:48)
want to hit the excellent make sure I (38:46 - 38:50)
catch it but like raspberry Ultra Ball (38:48 - 38:52)
excellent (38:50 - 38:54)
oh didn't catch it (38:52 - 38:57)
and you had to catch 10 and I'm like (38:54 - 39:00)
we are going to be here literally until (38:57 - 39:02)
I die (39:00 - 39:06)
because this is so abysmally slow and (39:02 - 39:08)
it's not I don't (39:06 - 39:08)
it is also a thing that turns people off (39:09 - 39:13)
the game (39:12 - 39:15)
because it's like oh I went to this (39:13 - 39:17)
great big great event and I'm so excited (39:15 - 39:19)
and I didn't catch it and I don't know (39:17 - 39:21)
when the next one is or I have to come (39:19 - 39:25)
back in three out no why did I do this (39:21 - 39:27)
especially for the low level people who (39:25 - 39:29)
don't have a set group and who don't (39:27 - 39:31)
have those catch rate bonuses from (39:29 - 39:34)
having the medals of Pokemon you have (39:31 - 39:35)
caught over the years (39:34 - 39:38)
it I mean I have I have played and done (39:35 - 39:39)
raids with new players (39:38 - 39:41)
it is very very hard for them to catch a (39:39 - 39:44)
Legendary their catch rate is just so (39:41 - 39:46)
much worse (39:44 - 39:49)
yeah somebody uh somebody I was playing (39:46 - 39:51)
with they were struggling to catch their (39:49 - 39:52)
set they failed to catch their first (39:51 - 39:54)
Reggie Drago there was only two (39:52 - 39:56)
uh they were getting frustrated that (39:54 - 39:58)
they went through 10 of their 22 (39:56 - 40:00)
pokeballs for the second Reggie Drago (39:58 - 40:02)
and I was like please hand me your phone (40:00 - 40:03)
because like (40:02 - 40:06)
I don't want to go to a third Reggie (40:03 - 40:09)
Drago for you I want you to get this one (40:06 - 40:12)
so we can go to lunch and then go home I (40:09 - 40:14)
don't want to do more Reggie Drago (40:12 - 40:17)
it took so much planning to get these (40:14 - 40:19)
two ready (40:17 - 40:21)
last thing I want to say (40:19 - 40:22)
um before we take a break (40:21 - 40:26)
I think that (40:22 - 40:27)
the community ambassador program (40:26 - 40:29)
something we haven't talked about is an (40:27 - 40:31)
actual great thing that Niantic is doing (40:29 - 40:33)
Niantic provides these people with codes (40:31 - 40:38)
and and and resources and they really do (40:33 - 40:40)
a great thing I didn't realize there (40:38 - 40:41)
were so many (40:40 - 40:43)
when I was (40:41 - 40:46)
going back into my Discord hole of (40:43 - 40:50)
regret to try to find Reggie Drago I (40:46 - 40:54)
just like I just thought to myself (40:50 - 40:58)
if there was somebody running this and (40:54 - 41:01)
encouraging people to like get excited (40:58 - 41:03)
and like don't worry this is the plan (41:01 - 41:06)
that whole experience would go so much (41:03 - 41:08)
more smoother and there was a cool thing (41:06 - 41:11)
that Niantic did in Seattle where they (41:08 - 41:13)
took (41:11 - 41:15)
um content creators and they put them in (41:13 - 41:19)
charge of like these raid trains and so (41:15 - 41:21)
um like it was me in the gocast (41:19 - 41:24)
and we had like a Sunday morning and (41:21 - 41:27)
then like a Saturday afternoon and (41:24 - 41:29)
Niantic was like okay meet (41:27 - 41:31)
the two creators that we put in charge (41:29 - 41:34)
at this time at this location all you (41:31 - 41:36)
have to do is show up and then me and (41:34 - 41:38)
the people from gocast we looked at the (41:36 - 41:39)
map and we're like okay let's go this (41:38 - 41:43)
way and we ended up doing 20 30 raids in (41:39 - 41:45)
our time and we had a whole group of (41:43 - 41:47)
people and we were like okay all right (41:45 - 41:48)
everyone good we're moving to the next (41:47 - 41:51)
one okay like hey just a heads up we're (41:48 - 41:53)
gonna cross a busy road like be safe and (41:51 - 41:54)
like hey does anyone need help anyone (41:53 - 41:57)
like we were in charge of that and it (41:54 - 41:59)
went super smooth and at the end of that (41:57 - 42:02)
in both days people were like this was a (41:59 - 42:03)
great experience like I've never done (42:02 - 42:05)
this before this was a great rate like I (42:03 - 42:07)
I got a shiny for the first time I've (42:05 - 42:10)
never done this many raids like I met (42:07 - 42:13)
people like it was a genuinely good (42:10 - 42:17)
experience and I think that sometimes (42:13 - 42:19)
because we have these solo experiences (42:17 - 42:22)
we or We complain about not having these (42:19 - 42:23)
group things or you see online people (42:22 - 42:25)
are like we don't have a local community (42:23 - 42:27)
like the Niantic doing this community (42:25 - 42:30)
ambassador program is really great the (42:27 - 42:32)
problem is like people have to dedicate (42:30 - 42:35)
their time and their passion to Pogo and (42:32 - 42:37)
I would love to do that in like I I was (42:35 - 42:39)
I was going to talk to Greg and be like (42:37 - 42:41)
we should get Golden Lures and we should (42:39 - 42:44)
pick a day where i'm good Greg knows a (42:41 - 42:45)
lot of people in Minnesota we could be (42:44 - 42:47)
like we could be like hey on on Saturday (42:45 - 42:50)
at Mall of America show up at 11 (42:47 - 42:52)
everyone pop down to Golden lure and we (42:50 - 42:53)
could all walk away with golden go (42:52 - 42:56)
easily like this has been proven in a (42:53 - 42:58)
couple cities that they can do it (42:56 - 43:01)
um and we could probably do it here and (42:58 - 43:03)
I could probably like organize and do (43:01 - 43:05)
that one time I would love to organize (43:03 - 43:07)
and do that for all of Pokemon go I just (43:05 - 43:09)
don't have the time and also where are (43:07 - 43:11)
you organizing it at (43:09 - 43:13)
like you have to there are so many (43:11 - 43:15)
different places to something that (43:13 - 43:17)
people feel comfortable using (43:15 - 43:20)
that you you still have to find a (43:17 - 43:24)
central location to house it so like it (43:20 - 43:27)
would be great if on the like go Fest (43:24 - 43:28)
days like (43:27 - 43:31)
as part of their ambassador program they (43:28 - 43:33)
built it into their website so at least (43:31 - 43:36)
everybody who's going to Pokemon go live (43:33 - 43:37)
if you're an ambassador you could sign (43:36 - 43:39)
up and say I'm going to run this event (43:37 - 43:41)
so that people aren't like well are you (43:39 - 43:43)
on Discord are you on Facebook are you (43:41 - 43:46)
on Twitter are you on Instagram are you (43:43 - 43:48)
on Tick Tock Which social media do I (43:46 - 43:49)
need to find you where is this (43:48 - 43:51)
information because what happens with (43:49 - 43:53)
most ambassadors is they are then (43:51 - 43:54)
spending (43:53 - 43:56)
they're doing the job of a social media (43:54 - 44:00)
manager across 50 social media platforms (43:56 - 44:02)
trying to hit (44:00 - 44:05)
everybody and they are barely being (44:02 - 44:07)
compensated for that work (44:05 - 44:08)
barely (44:07 - 44:10)
and there are probably better (44:08 - 44:12)
communities than others Better Community (44:10 - 44:15)
ambassadors than others but like (44:12 - 44:17)
there there is a lot of value to (44:15 - 44:20)
somebody who (44:17 - 44:21)
cares enough about Pokemon go and cares (44:20 - 44:23)
enough to (44:21 - 44:26)
Foster a good community in the area and (44:23 - 44:29)
if you don't have that (44:26 - 44:30)
um (44:29 - 44:33)
you you could have a worse experience (44:30 - 44:35)
right you you'd be the person that'd be (44:33 - 44:36)
like well there's no Community here and (44:35 - 44:39)
if somebody in your community took (44:36 - 44:40)
charge you would have a community (44:39 - 44:41)
whether or not you want to participate (44:40 - 44:43)
in that community that is up to you but (44:41 - 44:45)
at least you at least you would have a (44:43 - 44:47)
group of people that you could be like (44:45 - 44:49)
well I don't talk to anyone (44:47 - 44:50)
um I don't really I'm not really part of (44:49 - 44:51)
the community but I know there is an (44:50 - 44:53)
active community and I know they will be (44:51 - 44:56)
at Reggie Drago in this park because (44:53 - 44:58)
they're always there because that's the (44:56 - 45:00)
community having a good leader having (44:58 - 45:02)
someone who is willing to teach and (45:00 - 45:04)
reach out to people and someone who can (45:02 - 45:07)
do those things means a lot I think it's (45:04 - 45:09)
one of the reasons that my uh Pokemon go (45:07 - 45:11)
club that I put together from college is (45:09 - 45:14)
still going because when you have a set (45:11 - 45:16)
group with somebody who is actively (45:14 - 45:17)
trying to get these things going and (45:16 - 45:18)
actively trying to get people together (45:17 - 45:22)
you have a healthier community (45:18 - 45:24)
but it's work (45:22 - 45:27)
it is it is work it absolutely is like (45:24 - 45:31)
it it is it is work it is often work (45:27 - 45:34)
that goes unthanked it is often work (45:31 - 45:37)
that easily gets taken for granted (45:34 - 45:38)
uh (45:37 - 45:41)
and it is (45:38 - 45:44)
so incredibly easy to burn out of that (45:41 - 45:45)
roll (45:44 - 45:51)
very very quickly it is hurting cats are (45:45 - 45:53)
exhausting it's exhausting when they're (45:51 - 45:55)
friends of yours and you're giving them (45:53 - 45:58)
the benefit of the doubt it is a million (45:55 - 45:59)
times worse when there are packus (45:58 - 46:01)
Rangers that you do not give (45:59 - 46:04)
any cares about you're like I don't I (46:01 - 46:07)
don't know you I'm doing this out of me (46:04 - 46:09)
being nice and if you are a horrible (46:07 - 46:14)
experience I no longer want to do this (46:09 - 46:14)
speaking of what people no longer want (46:16 - 46:20)
to do linking their Pokemon go account (46:18 - 46:24)
to their switch but (46:20 - 46:24)
that's not the actual issue so we'll (46:25 - 46:29)
talk about the actual issue (46:27 - 46:32)
when we come back from our break uh uh (46:29 - 46:35)
and then uh we'll talk about the next (46:32 - 46:37)
update plan for Pokemon scarlet and (46:35 - 46:40)
violet we will be right back (46:37 - 46:46)
and we are back from our break all right (46:40 - 46:50)
so left the transition of it is possible (46:46 - 46:53)
to connect Pokemon go to scarlet and (46:50 - 46:56)
violet you do two things with that the (46:53 - 46:58)
first thing is you can get the different (46:56 - 47:00)
forms of Vivion (46:58 - 47:04)
uh into scarlet and violet yep which is (47:00 - 47:06)
the first way ever that you could (47:04 - 47:09)
theoretically get them with your own (47:06 - 47:11)
trainer ID and shiny hunt them all (47:09 - 47:15)
without importing DS's from countries (47:11 - 47:18)
this is devouring my baby on I spent an (47:15 - 47:21)
entire year traveling the world (47:18 - 47:24)
millions of dollars spent as I used a (47:21 - 47:26)
hot air balloon to travel the world with (47:24 - 47:30)
my 3DS to catch all the different Vivion (47:26 - 47:32)
and here they are postcarding it away (47:30 - 47:34)
for cheap (47:32 - 47:37)
yeah uh the second thing is if you send (47:34 - 47:40)
any postcard I guess technically you (47:37 - 47:42)
this happens both ways (47:40 - 47:44)
um because you'd still get the Vivion (47:42 - 47:47)
from it uh you would get a opportunity (47:44 - 47:50)
to open your gimme ghoul box (47:47 - 47:53)
which is kind of like the meltan Box (47:50 - 47:56)
except you can use it every day (47:53 - 47:59)
um and you have to sync your you just (47:56 - 48:01)
have to send any postcard (47:59 - 48:03)
I think it's too complicated in this (48:01 - 48:05)
podcast to explain how to do that you (48:03 - 48:09)
have to like go into it it's not um (48:05 - 48:11)
I walked a bunch of people through it (48:09 - 48:12)
yesterday it (48:11 - 48:16)
taking uh small steps every time yeah uh (48:12 - 48:19)
you have to go into your postcard book (48:16 - 48:22)
to thence it's it's it's not great (48:19 - 48:24)
hopefully they fix that (48:22 - 48:26)
um okay so there there are a ton we (48:24 - 48:27)
talked about this last week there are a (48:26 - 48:29)
ton of people out there that refuse to (48:27 - 48:32)
do this feature uh because they oh the (48:29 - 48:34)
part of the reason why you would want to (48:32 - 48:36)
do the Gimme ghoul box for the record is (48:34 - 48:38)
when you do it five times you then get (48:36 - 48:41)
the golden lure which if you spin the (48:38 - 48:44)
golden lure you get coins uh anyone who (48:41 - 48:47)
spends the golden Lair can get coins so (48:44 - 48:48)
earlier we talked about how communities (48:47 - 48:51)
were getting everyone to bring their (48:48 - 48:52)
golden lure to a place and then if (48:51 - 48:55)
everyone lays it down it's easy to then (48:52 - 48:59)
get golden go because you need 99 999 (48:55 - 49:00)
coins (48:59 - 49:02)
the Golden Lures are the fast way to get (49:00 - 49:05)
coins yes if you catch gimme ghoul you (49:02 - 49:06)
have a chance of getting a coin when you (49:05 - 49:08)
catch him (49:06 - 49:08)
um (49:08 - 49:10)
so (49:08 - 49:12)
you have to do it five times you get a (49:10 - 49:14)
golden blur and I believe then another (49:12 - 49:16)
five times gets you a golden lure so (49:14 - 49:20)
I believe you could hold two at once (49:16 - 49:22)
like it should work like other lures (49:20 - 49:25)
where you can like stack them so ideally (49:22 - 49:27)
in 15 days you could have three and go (49:25 - 49:29)
to a place and lay down all three I (49:27 - 49:31)
guess I think that's how it works uh (49:29 - 49:32)
somebody can correct me if I'm wrong if (49:31 - 49:35)
you could only hold one (49:32 - 49:35)
that being said (49:36 - 49:40)
um we talked about last week how or (49:38 - 49:43)
maybe the week before how there's a bug (49:40 - 49:45)
right now that's happening where people (49:43 - 49:48)
are losing their saved data it's a very (49:45 - 49:51)
very very small amount of people I want (49:48 - 49:52)
to remind everyone that this game sold (49:51 - 49:54)
23 million copies and sword and shield (49:52 - 49:57)
has sold 26 million copies one of those (49:54 - 49:58)
games has been up for three years (49:57 - 50:00)
another one of those games has been out (49:58 - 50:03)
for three months uh so uh whether or not (50:00 - 50:06)
you hate scarlet and violet it's uh (50:03 - 50:09)
undeniably uh it's undeniable that it (50:06 - 50:11)
sold very well (50:09 - 50:13)
um (50:11 - 50:17)
when the reports of I lost all my data (50:13 - 50:20)
began it began because somebody said I (50:17 - 50:22)
was doing the Vivion stuff (50:20 - 50:25)
and I believe we said on this very show (50:22 - 50:27)
that there were reports of people saying (50:25 - 50:31)
they don't even play Pokemon go and they (50:27 - 50:33)
lost their stuff (50:31 - 50:36)
so again we're just reiterating (50:33 - 50:39)
that other people have now tried to (50:36 - 50:42)
prove it try to replicate it it has (50:39 - 50:43)
nothing to do with the Pokemon go (50:42 - 50:46)
connection (50:43 - 50:46)
um (50:46 - 50:48)
there there are I don't know if we can (50:48 - 50:51)
100 (50:50 - 50:56)
say it has nothing to do with it because (50:51 - 50:58)
if somebody has never even installed (50:56 - 50:59)
Pokemon go and they lost other data it (50:58 - 51:01)
has nothing to do with the connection (50:59 - 51:05)
you can't replicate it yes (51:01 - 51:06)
it could have something to do with it (51:05 - 51:08)
but also have to run into something (51:06 - 51:10)
maybe a particular time on the clock (51:08 - 51:13)
maybe a particular (51:10 - 51:15)
type of internet connection I don't even (51:13 - 51:19)
know it could be one factor but people (51:15 - 51:20)
haven't been able to replicate it so we (51:19 - 51:22)
don't know I think the factor is it's (51:20 - 51:26)
the 1.2 update it's there there is a (51:22 - 51:28)
factor (51:26 - 51:30)
but I think but if I if I install 1.2 (51:28 - 51:32)
and I don't I've never played Pokemon go (51:30 - 51:34)
in my life and I lost my data I can (51:32 - 51:36)
safely say that it has nothing to do (51:34 - 51:40)
with Pokemon go I've never done anything (51:36 - 51:40)
it doesn't for those players there's (51:41 - 51:45)
just of the people who have run into (51:43 - 51:47)
this bug there is a large enough (51:45 - 51:51)
subcategory of them who say that this (51:47 - 51:52)
happened right after them doing the (51:51 - 51:56)
Vivion that I don't want to completely (51:52 - 51:57)
rule that out (51:56 - 52:00)
I know people who have gotten did Vivian (51:57 - 52:02)
every single day and they have not had (52:00 - 52:04)
this issue yeah no I I don't think that (52:02 - 52:07)
this is a common thing I have also not (52:04 - 52:10)
seen anyone who updated (52:07 - 52:12)
over a week ago and then suddenly lost (52:10 - 52:14)
their data today (52:12 - 52:17)
from my understanding the data loss is (52:14 - 52:20)
pretty shortly after you update now it (52:17 - 52:22)
is possible that somebody hasn't played (52:20 - 52:25)
scarlet and violet until two days ago (52:22 - 52:27)
and when they logged in two days ago (52:25 - 52:29)
they were forced to do the 1.2 update (52:27 - 52:31)
and then shortly after they lost their (52:29 - 52:34)
data that is possible but I think if you (52:31 - 52:35)
are listening to this podcast right now (52:34 - 52:37)
and you have been playing since the (52:35 - 52:40)
update I have not seen any experience of (52:37 - 52:41)
somebody being like I've been playing (52:40 - 52:44)
for 10 days and now I lost my data as (52:41 - 52:46)
long as you have saved and closed and (52:44 - 52:48)
opened your game again since then yeah I (52:46 - 52:51)
think I probably agree yeah like I like (52:48 - 52:53)
I like I think the the the the the (52:51 - 52:56)
if you have successfully closed and (52:53 - 52:58)
opened your game you are probably fine (52:56 - 53:00)
is what it comes down to (52:58 - 53:02)
but there were there were people out (53:00 - 53:03)
there specifically when Vivion was (53:02 - 53:05)
coming out saying like Okay well is it (53:03 - 53:08)
Vivion and they were trying to (53:05 - 53:11)
replicate it and like what is it because (53:08 - 53:13)
it's too Vivion again for the people who (53:11 - 53:16)
lost their data which sucks by the way (53:13 - 53:18)
um I think we're up to like 50 people (53:16 - 53:22)
now again at least if one million people (53:18 - 53:24)
updated their game 50 people out of 1 (53:22 - 53:25)
million is (53:24 - 53:29)
very small that's not to like that sucks (53:25 - 53:31)
for those 50 people 100 (53:29 - 53:31)
um (53:31 - 53:33)
it's not like Pokemon games are the only (53:31 - 53:34)
games in the world where people have (53:33 - 53:37)
lost data right like or if you played a (53:34 - 53:38)
Bethesda game I'm sure you've lost your (53:37 - 53:41)
data and who knows what kind of way (53:38 - 53:43)
because Bethesda games are also terribly (53:41 - 53:45)
broken (53:43 - 53:49)
but uh what was my point the (53:45 - 53:52)
the Vivion isn't yeah I don't think it's (53:49 - 53:55)
the Vivion and I don't think (53:52 - 53:57)
and we also know that there are some (53:55 - 54:00)
people who didn't buy the DLC who also (53:57 - 54:02)
lost their data which was another DLC (54:00 - 54:03)
isn't (54:02 - 54:05)
it that was another thing that people (54:03 - 54:07)
had thought but the DLC definitely is (54:05 - 54:09)
not (54:07 - 54:10)
um (54:09 - 54:13)
I don't know I don't think we can say (54:10 - 54:15)
definitely but most likely is not (54:13 - 54:19)
a factor uh Mr Joe serebi said that he (54:15 - 54:21)
reached out to the Pokemon company about (54:19 - 54:24)
this and they said they are aware (54:21 - 54:27)
whatever that means they're still (54:24 - 54:29)
looking at it (54:27 - 54:31)
right I mean the thing is is I think (54:29 - 54:32)
like we've waited the week because we (54:31 - 54:34)
talked about last week we've waited a (54:32 - 54:36)
week they can't successfully replicate (54:34 - 54:37)
it (54:36 - 54:39)
yeah in in (54:37 - 54:42)
a meaningful way is most likely saying (54:39 - 54:43)
they're looking into it meaning they (54:42 - 54:44)
have not been able to successfully (54:43 - 54:46)
replicate it so they are still looking (54:44 - 54:48)
which means it is no matter what (54:46 - 54:51)
triggers it it is a a fairly rare series (54:48 - 54:55)
of events that a very large corporation (54:51 - 54:58)
can't replicate what is happening that (54:55 - 55:00)
means it is generally small this is the (54:58 - 55:02)
week we usually wait when we say like (55:00 - 55:03)
something's happening if you want to be (55:02 - 55:05)
safe wait a week and see if they can (55:03 - 55:08)
replicate it they can't so they're still (55:05 - 55:09)
looking into it because they need to (55:08 - 55:10)
know (55:09 - 55:13)
what series of events causes it so they (55:10 - 55:17)
can fix the bug or say oh it's this or (55:13 - 55:19)
put some set advice but generally it's a (55:17 - 55:24)
it is a rare series of events that is a (55:19 - 55:26)
very specific sequence that they have (55:24 - 55:30)
not tapped down yet (55:26 - 55:30)
yeah and there's a lot of variables that (55:31 - 55:36)
can happen like (55:34 - 55:38)
were these people date skipping were (55:36 - 55:40)
there was their clock the wrong time (55:38 - 55:42)
when they updated uh did these people (55:40 - 55:44)
have an SD card did they not have an SD (55:42 - 55:47)
card did where was there was their (55:44 - 55:50)
internal storage full was it not full I (55:47 - 55:52)
know I know Pokemon doesn't save to the (55:50 - 55:55)
SD card but there can still be (55:52 - 55:57)
issues with an SD card affecting (55:55 - 56:00)
something else like (55:57 - 56:02)
um there can still be corruption in in (56:00 - 56:04)
us in a sense (56:02 - 56:06)
um not specifically with Pokemon but (56:04 - 56:08)
like something wrong with the SD card (56:06 - 56:09)
affecting the system or the system (56:08 - 56:12)
having trouble to read (56:09 - 56:15)
it was it a Wi-Fi disconnection right (56:12 - 56:17)
like did did their Wi-Fi have a hiccup (56:15 - 56:20)
when it was downloading 1.2 and didn't (56:17 - 56:23)
download two of the megabytes of the 1.2 (56:20 - 56:25)
like it there's so many different (56:23 - 56:26)
variables (56:25 - 56:30)
um that it is possible that they may not (56:26 - 56:33)
be able to ever reproduce it and the (56:30 - 56:35)
you know there's the point zero zero (56:33 - 56:36)
zero one percent chance when people (56:35 - 56:38)
upgrade to 1.2 that (56:36 - 56:40)
there's corruption and they lose their (56:38 - 56:42)
stuff (56:40 - 56:43)
I said this last week I will say it (56:42 - 56:45)
again I I don't think these people are (56:43 - 56:47)
going to get some magical recovery (56:45 - 56:50)
feature nah (56:47 - 56:50)
because that would require game freak to (56:50 - 56:55)
then spend resources and time trying to (56:53 - 56:56)
if they can't even figure out what's (56:55 - 56:59)
causing the issue like that's not a good (56:56 - 57:01)
sign right like if if they could say (56:59 - 57:03)
like oh like this was the issue and now (57:01 - 57:04)
we're (57:03 - 57:06)
who knows there isn't another another (57:04 - 57:07)
update coming (57:06 - 57:10)
but it's not related to this yes so this (57:07 - 57:12)
is off nintendolife.com (57:10 - 57:14)
uh (57:12 - 57:17)
game freak tweeted uh which is very rare (57:14 - 57:19)
for them to do (57:17 - 57:19)
um (57:19 - 57:23)
that uh the new the next update will fix (57:19 - 57:26)
a few bugs but a bug mostly when a (57:23 - 57:28)
player would catch an egg instead of (57:26 - 57:30)
walking wake or iron leaves if they were (57:28 - 57:33)
on version 1.1 when the raid event (57:30 - 57:35)
started locking them out of catching (57:33 - 57:38)
Pokemon a repeat of The Raid event will (57:35 - 57:41)
return around the same time as the (57:38 - 57:43)
update we will provide more info as it (57:41 - 57:44)
comes (57:43 - 57:49)
so this is scheduled for late April if I (57:44 - 57:51)
remember correctly (57:49 - 57:52)
um for some reason this press release (57:51 - 57:54)
doesn't have it but they have the notes (57:52 - 57:56)
uh (57:54 - 57:59)
this is a weird bug too (57:56 - 58:01)
because the reason people were able to (57:59 - 58:04)
catch an egg and not walking wake or (58:01 - 58:06)
iron leaves is because they didn't (58:04 - 58:10)
update to 1.2 but the game shouldn't (58:06 - 58:12)
have let them connect to the internet (58:10 - 58:14)
mm-hmm (58:12 - 58:17)
it sounds like if they were connected to (58:14 - 58:19)
the internet already (58:17 - 58:21)
like they were in the game yeah they (58:19 - 58:23)
were in the game The Raid started they (58:21 - 58:26)
saw it they joined somebody joined (58:23 - 58:29)
somebody else's raid and then it flipped (58:26 - 58:30)
out (58:29 - 58:33)
which is like such a weird series that (58:30 - 58:35)
have happened but enough people were (58:33 - 58:37)
able to do it that they're like okay we (58:35 - 58:39)
here we have a fix we're gonna fix it (58:37 - 58:41)
and then we're gonna redo the raid you (58:39 - 58:43)
literally had to be playing the game and (58:41 - 58:44)
connected to the internet when the (58:43 - 58:46)
update came out (58:44 - 58:48)
ignore that update (58:46 - 58:50)
continue playing because if you would (58:48 - 58:52)
have closed the game right or like put (58:50 - 58:54)
it on standby it would have disconnected (58:52 - 58:57)
you so you would have and then go and (58:54 - 59:02)
just do the raid yeah so (58:57 - 59:05)
they probably know exactly how many (59:02 - 59:07)
people that was because it had to be (59:05 - 59:09)
very specific (59:07 - 59:12)
but those people couldn't catch iron (59:09 - 59:14)
leaf or walking wake they ended up (59:12 - 59:17)
catching an egg or (59:14 - 59:19)
um so (59:17 - 59:21)
they can't catch it at all because well (59:19 - 59:23)
after so after they did it when they (59:21 - 59:25)
updated it it didn't allow them to catch (59:23 - 59:27)
anymore so they're fixing it for those (59:25 - 59:28)
people (59:27 - 59:30)
they said other bug updates will happen (59:28 - 59:33)
I don't know (59:30 - 59:37)
I mean like Joe Serebii or (59:33 - 59:39)
you know somebody close to the Pokemon (59:37 - 59:41)
company talking to the Pokemon company (59:39 - 59:42)
is one thing (59:41 - 59:45)
the Pokemon company tweeting about this (59:42 - 59:46)
egg issue and saying an update is coming (59:45 - 59:50)
is a whole nother thing I'm curious if (59:46 - 59:52)
the Pokemon company doesn't want to (59:50 - 59:55)
tweet about the 1.2 issue (59:52 - 59:57)
because (59:55 - 60:00)
they don't know what it is yet (59:57 - 60:02)
like and it could be like they don't (60:00 - 60:05)
want to even admit it's their fault (60:02 - 60:07)
I mean (60:05 - 60:09)
yeah it that could be an element of it (60:07 - 60:12)
it could be that the 1.2 issue is just (60:09 - 60:15)
much much smaller than the AG issue was (60:12 - 60:17)
I mean it does sound like the I guess (60:15 - 60:20)
she was uh rare but definitely something (60:17 - 60:22)
people could have run into (60:20 - 60:26)
100 I can imagine playing a game during (60:22 - 60:27)
that time and then you see that these (60:26 - 60:29)
new things are out and go oh I'm already (60:27 - 60:31)
online I can just go do this yeah (60:29 - 60:33)
which that could happen very easily you (60:31 - 60:35)
don't need to update to do cinderizing (60:33 - 60:37)
Greninja and those were new Pokemon (60:35 - 60:40)
being added so no fault to them to be (60:37 - 60:41)
like oh these are just new Pokemon being (60:40 - 60:43)
added but yeah (60:41 - 60:45)
so (60:43 - 60:49)
uh I mean we have no idea how many (60:45 - 60:51)
people were impacted by the catch and (60:49 - 60:54)
egg glitch but we do kind of have an (60:51 - 60:57)
idea of how small the 1.2 (60:54 - 61:01)
corruption bug is at least as far as we (60:57 - 61:03)
can tell it's very very very very small (61:01 - 61:05)
well even if it's just the egg thing (61:03 - 61:07)
they can replicate it like they figured (61:05 - 61:08)
out what happened and they can put a bug (61:07 - 61:10)
fix it and say we'll run it again this (61:08 - 61:12)
is something we found we replicated it (61:10 - 61:16)
and now we can fix it like (61:12 - 61:18)
that sort of explains generally how (61:16 - 61:20)
companies are like yep we found it we (61:18 - 61:22)
fixed it we replicated it and we can (61:20 - 61:23)
come up with steps to remedy whereas (61:22 - 61:26)
with the same thing they are lost as to (61:23 - 61:31)
what causes it or how to fix it (61:26 - 61:31)
yeah I was gonna say I was I was I was (61:31 - 61:38)
somewhat excited to come back to the (61:36 - 61:40)
show and be like well it's been two (61:38 - 61:43)
weeks since 1.2 on the plus side my game (61:40 - 61:45)
hasn't crashed yet (61:43 - 61:48)
that's (61:45 - 61:48)
uh that hasn't happened how's that I I (61:50 - 61:56)
will post my game doing really weird (61:53 - 61:58)
things on social media I think for the (61:56 - 62:01)
most part it's funny like I play other (61:58 - 62:05)
video games too like I I like I I and (62:01 - 62:08)
other video games do have it like silly (62:05 - 62:12)
weird blogs glitches crashes like (62:08 - 62:15)
I I don't while I do think scarlet and (62:12 - 62:17)
violet is is a pretty buggy mess like (62:15 - 62:20)
I've played much buggier ridiculous (62:17 - 62:23)
things happen in other games so like to (62:20 - 62:25)
me it's just funny I think they're (62:23 - 62:27)
coming off of the buggy mess that was (62:25 - 62:30)
brilliant I've been shining Pearl (62:27 - 62:33)
into another buggy mess is adding to (62:30 - 62:36)
people's frustration well yeah you had (62:33 - 62:38)
Arceus in the middle there yeah but and (62:36 - 62:41)
also really demonstrating anything too (62:38 - 62:43)
wild (62:41 - 62:46)
again (62:43 - 62:46)
oh but and also brilliant Diamond (62:48 - 62:53)
shining Pearl was ilka yes yeah but (62:50 - 62:56)
people aren't going to make that right (62:53 - 63:00)
like instinctually like emotionally it's (62:56 - 63:04)
like the the main Series games have had (63:00 - 63:07)
two buggy Messes in a row like yeah (63:04 - 63:11)
Legends Arceus don't get don't get too (63:07 - 63:13)
yeah (63:11 - 63:16)
for for people who are on audio Greg is (63:13 - 63:18)
using quotation marks there (63:16 - 63:20)
um I do I mean I do hate the thing of (63:18 - 63:22)
like Nintendo would never allow this to (63:20 - 63:23)
happen these people clearly have never (63:22 - 63:26)
played Super Mario Sunshine (63:23 - 63:29)
uh and Nintendo did allow that to happen (63:26 - 63:31)
for Super Mario Sunshine anyways also (63:29 - 63:32)
like watch speedrunners Play Breath of (63:31 - 63:35)
the wild that game is in get game can be (63:32 - 63:37)
incredibly broken if you know how to (63:35 - 63:39)
break it like hey everybody play an (63:37 - 63:41)
original gen 1 cartridge if you want to (63:39 - 63:44)
know how buggy a Pokemon game could be (63:41 - 63:46)
like (63:44 - 63:48)
most po like I can think of like with (63:46 - 63:50)
maybe the exception of black and white I (63:48 - 63:52)
can think of (63:50 - 63:53)
I'm sure black and white has bugs don't (63:52 - 63:55)
get me wrong but like (63:53 - 63:57)
man like the Gen one one through four (63:55 - 63:59)
like there's so many things that are (63:57 - 64:00)
broken Gen 6 has a lot of things that (63:59 - 64:03)
are broken seven (64:00 - 64:05)
um like like all Pokemon games have been (64:03 - 64:07)
broken three had the berry issue that (64:05 - 64:10)
you had to go and get a file upload for (64:07 - 64:13)
crying out loud like every generation (64:10 - 64:17)
has bugs I think (64:13 - 64:19)
not (64:17 - 64:21)
most of them have been small and (64:19 - 64:24)
somewhat specific and generally not like (64:21 - 64:27)
I've glitched through the floor or I (64:24 - 64:29)
made a sandwich and it launched me into (64:27 - 64:31)
space or yeah I'm connected with my (64:29 - 64:34)
friend and they have 17 foot long arms (64:31 - 64:36)
and are running around on an invisible (64:34 - 64:41)
bike like like I'm into all of this (64:36 - 64:41)
okay so I had I had a series of issues (64:42 - 64:46)
so again I I post some of my bugs on (64:44 - 64:47)
social media I think they're mostly (64:46 - 64:50)
funny like I'm like whatever right like (64:47 - 64:52)
a bug happens I think it's I think it's (64:50 - 64:54)
more humorous than not really not the (64:52 - 64:55)
end of the world right maybe I lost like (64:54 - 64:57)
two minutes of save data or something (64:55 - 65:00)
and I always get comments that are like (64:57 - 65:02)
how how is your game so buggy like do (65:00 - 65:04)
you have digital do you have physical (65:02 - 65:06)
like I've never experienced a bug in my (65:04 - 65:08)
life and it's like I don't I still don't (65:06 - 65:10)
believe you maybe you have different (65:08 - 65:14)
definitions of what bugs are but it when (65:10 - 65:15)
I was playing Scarlet Violet the other (65:14 - 65:18)
night I spent literally (65:15 - 65:21)
not exaggerating four hours deleting (65:18 - 65:24)
Pokemon I was in messagosa I was talking (65:21 - 65:26)
to the big and small lady and I was (65:24 - 65:28)
checking every single Pokemon I have (65:26 - 65:30)
ever caught and then that took four (65:28 - 65:32)
hours and she was like this is the (65:30 - 65:35)
biggest one I've ever seen and whatever (65:32 - 65:37)
right and then after she said that none (65:35 - 65:39)
of my Pokemon were big or tiny I then (65:37 - 65:41)
promptly started throwing them all away (65:39 - 65:43)
because I have now checked that they (65:41 - 65:45)
don't have a mark they're not shiny they (65:43 - 65:46)
don't have anything special about them (65:45 - 65:47)
they don't have big or small they're (65:46 - 65:50)
going to the grinder right Professor Oak (65:47 - 65:51)
very happy he's getting these these (65:50 - 65:53)
Pokemon (65:51 - 65:53)
um (65:53 - 65:56)
and then I was like oh it's daylight (65:53 - 65:58)
when I started this it was night time it (65:56 - 66:00)
is daylight now I'm gonna go to the (65:58 - 66:03)
auction so I fast travel from messagosa (66:00 - 66:07)
to the lighthouse and I started walking (66:03 - 66:10)
to the auction and I am walking under (66:07 - 66:14)
water like is this the slowest like I (66:10 - 66:15)
know we talk about how this game has no (66:14 - 66:18)
frames it it is literally one frame a (66:15 - 66:21)
second I am falling from the lighthouse (66:18 - 66:23)
into the city at one frame a second I (66:21 - 66:27)
get into the auction house there are no (66:23 - 66:30)
people at all in the auction house it is (66:27 - 66:35)
dead empty and slowly One By One The (66:30 - 66:37)
People start spawning in and I was like (66:35 - 66:40)
are we not selling anything and then (66:37 - 66:43)
eventually they then pop up above their (66:40 - 66:45)
head that they're selling something it (66:43 - 66:48)
was uh I I it was a nightmare like I've (66:45 - 66:50)
never seen the game so slow and of (66:48 - 66:52)
course my twitch I was like ah you're (66:50 - 66:54)
probably leaking memory which has (66:52 - 66:58)
already been proven that memory leakages (66:54 - 67:01)
yeah so I was like you know what you (66:58 - 67:03)
guys are right I'm just gonna believe (67:01 - 67:06)
you guys I know I know that every time I (67:03 - 67:09)
have reset my game to like air quote (67:06 - 67:11)
reset the memory I get a crash shortly (67:09 - 67:14)
afterwards I wanna just point out I am (67:11 - 67:16)
playing I I am playing at a digital (67:14 - 67:18)
version I am up to date there's (67:16 - 67:19)
literally nothing else on my SD card (67:18 - 67:21)
because I only download Pokemon games (67:19 - 67:23)
and I'm running on a switch OLED brand (67:21 - 67:25)
new it's not like a you know like a (67:23 - 67:27)
six-year-old switch right not that the (67:25 - 67:31)
OLED is faster it's just new you know so (67:27 - 67:32)
there's not at least there's not a lot (67:31 - 67:34)
of dust in it yet (67:32 - 67:37)
so I I saved the game I close it out and (67:34 - 67:39)
then everyone in twitch chat is like (67:37 - 67:40)
you're gonna turn your game back on (67:39 - 67:41)
you're gonna have data loss and I was (67:40 - 67:45)
like at this point I hope so (67:41 - 67:45)
put me out of my misery right now so (67:45 - 67:49)
everyone's holding their breath I turned (67:47 - 67:53)
my game back on it turns on fine (67:49 - 67:53)
um and then I was like I start running (67:53 - 67:57)
around I can't even remember the the (67:55 - 67:59)
auction house town (67:57 - 68:02)
um (67:59 - 68:02)
yeah uh uh so I start running around and (68:02 - 68:07)
I'm like oh maybe you guys were right (68:06 - 68:09)
like like it's I no longer feel (68:07 - 68:10)
underwater like everything feels really (68:09 - 68:13)
smooth uh so I start running around for (68:10 - 68:16)
60 seconds I go to open my menu my whole (68:13 - 68:19)
game crashes it's just black screen not (68:16 - 68:21)
even on for two minutes (68:19 - 68:23)
I didn't do anything right I literally (68:21 - 68:26)
just opened the game spun in a circle (68:23 - 68:28)
and then tapped the button for my menu (68:26 - 68:30)
whole game Crash is gone and then (68:28 - 68:34)
everyone goes here's the date a lot (68:30 - 68:34)
so I reopened the game (68:36 - 68:41)
and I'm like I'm gonna lose everything (68:40 - 68:44)
this is it and game boots up just fine (68:41 - 68:46)
and I'm like okay great I was like (68:44 - 68:48)
before I go to bed it's like 12 15 in (68:46 - 68:50)
the morning I gotta go out to Reggie (68:48 - 68:53)
Drago I'm going to sync myself the Gimme (68:50 - 68:54)
ghoul (68:53 - 68:57)
and then I'm going to like we're gonna (68:54 - 68:59)
end stream right I just got I'm gonna do (68:57 - 69:00)
it on stream otherwise I'm gonna forget (68:59 - 69:03)
so I do the connect to Pokemon go I go (69:00 - 69:05)
into Pokemon go to grab a postcard I was (69:03 - 69:06)
like any postcard's fine I don't care (69:05 - 69:09)
about Vivion I go to connect (69:06 - 69:13)
and it goes connection issue and then my (69:09 - 69:15)
game boots down again oh that's your (69:13 - 69:17)
data loss right there and then I was (69:15 - 69:20)
like this is this this is it this this (69:17 - 69:22)
this this this (69:20 - 69:22)
oh (69:22 - 69:26)
I have done nothing I have booted my (69:23 - 69:28)
game fresh up from a crash and all I (69:26 - 69:30)
want to do is sync a postcard and I was (69:28 - 69:32)
like this is it this is I'm I (69:30 - 69:35)
everything's gone like there's no way (69:32 - 69:38)
and I boot it back up my data is still (69:35 - 69:40)
there I was like all right one more time (69:38 - 69:42)
I am why not right where we've made it (69:40 - 69:45)
this far I go to sing send the Gimme (69:42 - 69:47)
gold postcard it sends it says that the (69:45 - 69:50)
box is now available to open and I was (69:47 - 69:52)
like all right (69:50 - 69:54)
that was that was 10 minutes of this (69:52 - 69:58)
video game like I it's not like I am I'm (69:54 - 70:00)
trying to the point of the story is like (69:58 - 70:02)
I'm not trying to break the game like I (70:00 - 70:04)
said I was in Mexico for four hours just (70:02 - 70:06)
doing like is this big or is this small (70:04 - 70:08)
and then I proceeded to throw away a (70:06 - 70:09)
bunch of Pokemon and then I fast (70:08 - 70:12)
traveled to an auction house and then my (70:09 - 70:13)
game (70:12 - 70:16)
felt like it was from 1962. like like it (70:13 - 70:18)
was like we haven't invented this (70:16 - 70:20)
technology yet do you like slideshows (70:18 - 70:21)
because you're about to watch a (70:20 - 70:25)
slideshow heck yeah I love them (70:21 - 70:30)
yes uh just FYI uh Pokemon unite is also (70:25 - 70:31)
crashing (70:30 - 70:33)
when you go through menu sometimes or (70:31 - 70:35)
just say (70:33 - 70:38)
no I know I know you wanted to move (70:35 - 70:40)
through our sluggish menus to maybe get (70:38 - 70:42)
to your emblems I'm going to tell you (70:40 - 70:44)
right now the answer to that (70:42 - 70:46)
is no (70:44 - 70:48)
and they're still The Mystery of the (70:46 - 70:50)
universe how unite runs so smoothly in (70:48 - 70:53)
game but the menus are these are low (70:50 - 70:54)
things (70:53 - 70:57)
this zashian thing where you have to go (70:54 - 70:58)
through the board game (70:57 - 71:01)
navigating to the board game (70:58 - 71:03)
takes (71:01 - 71:08)
for ever their menus are so flippin slow (71:03 - 71:12)
for no good but hey as long as I'm in a (71:08 - 71:13)
match so I can get angry in real time (71:12 - 71:16)
I'm happy (71:13 - 71:16)
um so yeah if you've updated to 1.2 and (71:18 - 71:23)
you are able to open and close your game (71:22 - 71:26)
I think it is somewhat safe to say that (71:23 - 71:28)
you were probably fine (71:26 - 71:31)
I know there are some people opting to (71:28 - 71:33)
skip decidueye this weekend because they (71:31 - 71:35)
are so scared they're going to lose (71:33 - 71:37)
their data but again (71:35 - 71:40)
I don't want to fear Monger you like (71:37 - 71:42)
there's no I I guess don't play your (71:40 - 71:45)
game until the end of April because it (71:42 - 71:46)
doesn't sound like a new update's coming (71:45 - 71:48)
anytime soon they came out and they were (71:46 - 71:51)
like end of April is our next update (71:48 - 71:53)
or use the second profile for the Vivion (71:51 - 71:56)
if you think it may be one of the things (71:53 - 71:58)
in the sequence of events that leads to (71:56 - 72:01)
this book that is the other thing that I (71:58 - 72:03)
have seen people suggesting (72:01 - 72:06)
that's a lot of work for a butterfly (72:03 - 72:09)
just wait at that point you've waited (72:06 - 72:11)
how many years at this point to get them (72:09 - 72:14)
you can wait another month (72:11 - 72:14)
um (72:15 - 72:17)
yeah I uh you know on the plus side if I (72:17 - 72:24)
would have lost my data in any of those (72:21 - 72:26)
three crashes in the matter of 10 (72:24 - 72:29)
minutes at least it would have been (72:26 - 72:31)
recorded because we have no recordings (72:29 - 72:33)
or footage of this happening we only (72:31 - 72:35)
have screenshots of people booting up (72:33 - 72:38)
their game being like data is gone so we (72:35 - 72:40)
have literally no recordings of this (72:38 - 72:41)
happening (72:40 - 72:44)
of this data loss happening in real time (72:41 - 72:47)
so again we don't we we don't know what (72:44 - 72:48)
they were doing with their switches we (72:47 - 72:49)
don't know (72:48 - 72:52)
if the common thing they had in common (72:49 - 72:54)
is they were all date skipping because (72:52 - 72:56)
of raids and they were all in (72:54 - 72:59)
2027. there are at least some people (72:56 - 73:00)
have said that is not the case but sure (72:59 - 73:03)
right yeah so there's there are some (73:00 - 73:05)
people that didn't buy the dealers (73:03 - 73:07)
to respond and I don't believe them (73:05 - 73:10)
either I want I want to point out that (73:07 - 73:11)
there was a game that was was called (73:10 - 73:14)
Animal Crossing New Horizons right it (73:11 - 73:16)
came out of the Nintendo switch it came (73:14 - 73:18)
out at the beginning of the pandemic (73:16 - 73:22)
and and you know before this game came (73:18 - 73:24)
out I thought to myself (73:22 - 73:26)
the internet is a good place (73:24 - 73:30)
what what Legend of that what because (73:26 - 73:32)
okay so before this game came out I (73:30 - 73:34)
thought to myself the internet is a good (73:32 - 73:36)
place because if I'm ever stuck in a (73:34 - 73:39)
game I could just Google what I'm stuck (73:36 - 73:41)
in right and then somewhere on the (73:39 - 73:43)
internet there would be a link I would (73:41 - 73:44)
click it it would give me the details (73:43 - 73:48)
and I think I have a look Joe and Joe (73:44 - 73:50)
and I are friends every time we see each (73:48 - 73:53)
other hang out hug great thing I I do (73:50 - 73:55)
make fun of Joe for having a very bad (73:53 - 73:57)
website I think Sarah B looks like it's (73:55 - 74:00)
from like 1996. it's nostalgic it's (73:57 - 74:03)
retro I I have to I I have to put on (74:00 - 74:06)
four pairs of glasses and zoom in to 300 (74:03 - 74:09)
uh uh view thing to even read this (74:06 - 74:12)
website of Serebii but you know (74:09 - 74:16)
the stuff on Serebii is like 99 right (74:12 - 74:18)
and if it's the one percent wrong if you (74:16 - 74:21)
tweet at Joe he'll be like oh my nope (74:18 - 74:22)
forgot about this let me go update it (74:21 - 74:25)
right uh when Animal Crossing came out (74:22 - 74:28)
the amount of misinformation and people (74:25 - 74:31)
just posting whatever they wanted and (74:28 - 74:32)
then like (74:31 - 74:34)
I don't know if this is true or not or (74:32 - 74:39)
like this was true in wild world that is (74:34 - 74:40)
a totally different game than New (74:39 - 74:42)
Horizons why are we just assuming it (74:40 - 74:44)
works the same way but the thing that (74:42 - 74:47)
drove me the most crazy is people had (74:44 - 74:50)
like the Final store Nooks of Nooks (74:47 - 74:54)
cranny and I was like I do not care if (74:50 - 74:56)
you have time traveled (74:54 - 74:59)
what did you do to get that store and (74:56 - 75:01)
did you time travel and people were like (74:59 - 75:03)
no I'm not the answer and people were (75:01 - 75:05)
like I'd never time traveled before I (75:03 - 75:07)
don't know how I got the store I I've (75:05 - 75:09)
only been playing this game for three (75:07 - 75:11)
days and I have the store and I'm like (75:09 - 75:14)
what are you how did you get the we then (75:11 - 75:16)
found out 30 days later that the only (75:14 - 75:18)
way to get the store was to play the (75:16 - 75:21)
game for 30 days and I had dozens if not (75:18 - 75:25)
like 50 people tell me that they have (75:21 - 75:27)
never time traveled yet they had the new (75:25 - 75:30)
store your definition of time travel is (75:27 - 75:32)
clearly not the same because it moved (75:30 - 75:35)
one day in the future that is still time (75:32 - 75:38)
travel if you moved six hours into the (75:35 - 75:40)
future that is still time travel for (75:38 - 75:42)
people to be like I never time traveled (75:40 - 75:44)
I don't know how I got the new store no (75:42 - 75:47)
you did time travel multiple times games (75:44 - 75:51)
six hours 24 hours three weeks that is (75:47 - 75:54)
still time traveling what like so people (75:51 - 75:55)
being like I've never experienced a bug (75:54 - 75:58)
we have debt for dead very different (75:55 - 76:01)
definitions of what bugs are (75:58 - 76:05)
like I can tell you I have never time (76:01 - 76:07)
traveled (76:05 - 76:07)
if you time travel no judgment anymore (76:12 - 76:17)
a lot of judgment here I am Rose I am (76:20 - 76:26)
resetting here (76:23 - 76:26)
we have to have a conversation (76:27 - 76:31)
we're like running (76:31 - 76:35)
I've already (76:33 - 76:38)
okay this hit during the pandemic when I (76:35 - 76:41)
already had difficulty with time as a (76:38 - 76:44)
general thing in my life the thought of (76:41 - 76:47)
switching it on my switch for any reason (76:44 - 76:51)
was going to compound chaos too much go (76:47 - 76:53)
ahead and not have that I was already (76:51 - 76:56)
struggling people I cannot be like what (76:53 - 76:59)
day is it well my switch says it's 20 (76:56 - 77:03)
27. that's probably right I don't know I (76:59 - 77:05)
still have no clue how much time has (77:03 - 77:08)
passed to the I know it's 20 23. it (77:05 - 77:10)
still feels like it's been 15 years I (77:08 - 77:12)
have no clue (77:10 - 77:14)
I think my favorite thing about the time (77:12 - 77:16)
travel 2 was there was like another (77:14 - 77:19)
streamer that I liked very popular they (77:16 - 77:20)
had like three thousand four thousand (77:19 - 77:21)
people watching them play Animal (77:20 - 77:24)
Crossing and I'm like they have the new (77:21 - 77:26)
store and this game's only been out for (77:24 - 77:28)
a week and I'm like (77:26 - 77:30)
I'm streaming so much Animal Crossing (77:28 - 77:31)
that I can't like watch other people (77:30 - 77:35)
right so I'm like twitch chat did so and (77:31 - 77:37)
so time travel they have the new store (77:35 - 77:39)
and they're all like nope never seen (77:37 - 77:42)
them time travel like like he's never (77:39 - 77:43)
they've never time travel on stream they (77:42 - 77:46)
say they've never time traveled like (77:43 - 77:47)
the game's been out for a week how do (77:46 - 77:49)
they have the new storm what did they do (77:47 - 77:51)
can you tell me what they're doing to (77:49 - 77:53)
get the new store (77:51 - 77:54)
and is it time travel and they're like (77:53 - 77:56)
no he's never they never time travel (77:54 - 77:58)
they were clearly time traveling off (77:56 - 78:01)
stream that's how they have the dishes (77:58 - 78:04)
anyways (78:01 - 78:06)
by the day (78:04 - 78:08)
the first statement you should have said (78:06 - 78:10)
is I have always found the internet (78:08 - 78:11)
useful because the internet has never (78:10 - 78:15)
been good the internet has been useful (78:11 - 78:16)
and it is still (78:15 - 78:20)
somewhat useful the point is yeah the (78:16 - 78:23)
point is that the time traveling the (78:20 - 78:24)
point is (78:23 - 78:28)
the blatant lying everyone is doing it (78:24 - 78:31)
it's the internet (78:28 - 78:31)
um (78:32 - 78:36)
Greninja or not Greninja what Greninja (78:33 - 78:39)
come decitui is coming this week if you (78:36 - 78:41)
need help with the Sid UI I posted a (78:39 - 78:43)
video (78:41 - 78:47)
on YouTube of if this is UI has Swords (78:43 - 78:48)
Dance and those are the Pokemon I would (78:47 - 78:51)
recommend I also posted graphics on (78:48 - 78:52)
Instagram (78:51 - 78:54)
um I actually made a small tweak to (78:52 - 78:56)
those Graphics uh actually the eve the (78:54 - 78:58)
EVS are fine and the nature is fine but (78:56 - 79:00)
I actually figured out if I flipped some (78:58 - 79:02)
of them I could get a one to two percent (79:00 - 79:06)
damage increase which is so tiny but (79:02 - 79:09)
like I will repost new graphics with the (79:06 - 79:10)
slight changes if you already built them (79:09 - 79:11)
it's not that big of a deal it's (79:10 - 79:13)
literally one percent (79:11 - 79:15)
um uh damage increase (79:13 - 79:18)
but um I'm also going to post a video (79:15 - 79:20)
probably on Tuesday of if disidui has (79:18 - 79:21)
nasty plot these are some recommended (79:20 - 79:23)
Pokemon spoiler they're pretty similar (79:21 - 79:24)
Pokemon it's just the EVS are slightly (79:23 - 79:26)
different (79:24 - 79:28)
um if for some reason decidui doesn't (79:26 - 79:29)
have nasty platter or short stance (79:28 - 79:31)
that's a really great win condition (79:29 - 79:33)
because I try to base the Pokemon off (79:31 - 79:35)
like the most damage that could come in (79:33 - 79:37)
one turn and if you can survive it (79:35 - 79:38)
so (79:37 - 79:40)
um I don't think it would have both I (79:38 - 79:41)
said this in the YouTube video it would (79:40 - 79:43)
be really weird for it to use two status (79:41 - 79:46)
type moves one for nasty plot one for (79:43 - 79:48)
uh sword stance I'm bringing my magic (79:46 - 79:50)
caliber again (79:48 - 79:52)
yeah I mean I'm back scholar was fine (79:50 - 79:53)
I'm gonna bring it and we're gonna win (79:52 - 79:55)
this is the thing too is I suggest five (79:53 - 79:56)
Pokemon and people are like what about (79:55 - 79:58)
the other 395 Pokemon (79:56 - 80:01)
the only one that matches is Max caliber (79:58 - 80:04)
that is the only one everything else is (80:01 - 80:05)
useless (80:04 - 80:07)
the only the only hesitation I would (80:05 - 80:09)
have for a back caliber is if decidue is (80:07 - 80:11)
feather dance because it's going to (80:09 - 80:13)
continue to lower your attack over it (80:11 - 80:14)
doesn't matter because Excalibur is (80:13 - 80:16)
amazing and we'll just be like I don't (80:14 - 80:18)
care about your feathers I don't care (80:16 - 80:20)
I'm awesome (80:18 - 80:22)
make a special (80:20 - 80:22)
attack (80:23 - 80:27)
outstanding it's 500 I'm pretty sure I'm (80:24 - 80:30)
not sure if that makes sense (80:27 - 80:33)
um so if you if you there there's the (80:30 - 80:35)
physical raid video up the special raid (80:33 - 80:38)
video will go up on Tuesday (80:35 - 80:39)
um if you need help (80:38 - 80:41)
um we'll be streaming it on on Thursday (80:39 - 80:43)
night um if you want me to help I'll be (80:41 - 80:45)
there if you want twitch chat help I (80:43 - 80:47)
promise you my twitch chat sometimes (80:45 - 80:48)
lies but they are really good at raids (80:47 - 80:49)
at this point (80:48 - 80:53)
um despite lying about time travel there (80:49 - 80:56)
you can't trust them for a second when (80:53 - 80:57)
it comes to animal crossing the Pokemon (80:56 - 80:59)
they're pretty okay Bex caliber's (80:57 - 81:02)
special attack is 75 and that is nothing (80:59 - 81:03)
bad (81:02 - 81:06)
that's not great I didn't say it was I (81:03 - 81:08)
didn't say it was great I said it was (81:06 - 81:12)
not bad it was not bad not great (81:08 - 81:14)
um so deciduey starts on the technically (81:12 - 81:18)
the 16th for the US 17th for UTC I (81:14 - 81:20)
believe it repeats immediately the next (81:18 - 81:22)
weekend where normally there's a week in (81:20 - 81:24)
between but just like rides in Pokemon (81:22 - 81:27)
go people like to do them right when (81:24 - 81:29)
they come out and then and that is a (81:27 - 81:32)
wasteland from that day forward and (81:29 - 81:34)
probably forget about them so (81:32 - 81:37)
um uh rates raids this weekend uh final (81:34 - 81:39)

believes Reynolds would have some sort (82:45 - 82:50)
of play in the upcoming sequel (82:47 - 82:52)
and then they go on to say what Pokemon (82:50 - 82:55)
they do all this stuff money (82:52 - 82:57)
cards shipped around the world video (82:55 - 82:59)
games if you didn't know what Pokemon (82:57 - 83:01)
was by the start of that article you'd (82:59 - 83:04)
know it after the end (83:01 - 83:04)
uh (83:06 - 83:10)
I was gonna say the same yeah (83:08 - 83:12)
well the thing is people are like oh I'm (83:10 - 83:13)
so excited I'm like (83:12 - 83:17)
you do say is in negotiations (83:13 - 83:20)
they have not signed that contract (83:17 - 83:23)
they are in negotiations to make it (83:20 - 83:25)
happen which people just likes the first (83:23 - 83:28)
movie a positive in the fact that (83:25 - 83:31)
somebody's talking about it like they're (83:28 - 83:33)
not gonna leave (83:31 - 83:33)
430 million dollars on the table right (83:34 - 83:37)
like (83:36 - 83:40)
the activities who made money they could (83:37 - 83:43)
probably make similar money on a sequel (83:40 - 83:45)
I don't know what story we have left to (83:43 - 83:47)
tell because we never got the second (83:45 - 83:48)
game so I have no idea what they're (83:47 - 83:50)
basing it off of (83:48 - 83:52)
what it's just at this point we're in (83:50 - 83:55)
the wild west what are you gonna say (83:52 - 83:58)
to be fair every time (83:55 - 83:58)
and I didn't talk to anybody else who (83:59 - 84:04)
didn't the game ended the way the game (84:02 - 84:07)
ended for a reason (84:04 - 84:07)
usually it's the video games that have (84:09 - 84:12)
the ending the movies have the weird (84:11 - 84:16)
Cliffhangers with the yeah (84:12 - 84:20)
I absolutely adored detective Pikachu I (84:16 - 84:22)
thought it was fantastic I thought it (84:20 - 84:24)
was great yeah I saw it twice in theater (84:22 - 84:26)
it's a fun watch it's a fun vibe it is (84:24 - 84:29)
not something I would necessarily go and (84:26 - 84:32)
watch if it wasn't I was brought up (84:29 - 84:33)
every once in a while because we think (84:32 - 84:36)
there may be a sequel someday I never (84:33 - 84:39)
had a desire to re-watch it (84:36 - 84:41)
no I don't think it's a perfect movie (84:39 - 84:45)
but it is definitely a fun movie yeah (84:41 - 84:47)
foreign (84:45 - 84:47)
yeah I don't think (85:07 - 85:12)
I I need I I don't need closure on but (85:10 - 85:15)
it was also kind of well if you want to (85:12 - 85:18)
make another live-action Pokemon movie a (85:15 - 85:20)
hundred percent I don't think it needs (85:18 - 85:21)
to be (85:20 - 85:25)
in the detective Pikachu world like I (85:21 - 85:26)
don't I don't think (85:25 - 85:28)
I don't think (85:26 - 85:31)
turning Ryan Reynolds back into Pikachu (85:28 - 85:34)
is like the the selling point of the (85:31 - 85:35)
movie there's another Freaky Friday (85:34 - 85:38)
situation folks it was just like yeah (85:35 - 85:41)
these these characters are telling a (85:38 - 85:43)
pretty easy to follow decent story it (85:41 - 85:46)
also just happens to be perfect (85:43 - 85:46)
huge a whole another person (85:50 - 85:53)
yeah I uh the one I don't know a lot (85:58 - 86:03)
about movie stuff but I know that (86:00 - 86:05)
unless (86:03 - 86:07)
the contracts are signed and a bunch of (86:05 - 86:09)
actors are assigned that movie is (86:07 - 86:13)
nothing until those that even then (86:09 - 86:15)
even then (86:13 - 86:17)
as we have learned this year they can (86:15 - 86:19)
finish a movie and have it ready for (86:17 - 86:22)
release and then they can decide nope (86:19 - 86:25)
we're gonna take a tax hit (86:22 - 86:27)
I guess we'll Circle back another four (86:25 - 86:30)
years if they decide to make (86:27 - 86:30)
yeah (86:34 - 86:38)
oh okay I know who that was I know that (86:35 - 86:40)
was the that was the the the (86:38 - 86:44)
chief detective yeah with the snubble (86:40 - 86:46)
with the snubble I remember when I was (86:44 - 86:47)
reading that name I was like I don't (86:46 - 86:50)
even know who who what role that was but (86:47 - 86:51)
not now you've got it (86:50 - 86:54)
and now I got it the what I do remember (86:51 - 86:57)
though after detective Pikachu was a (86:54 - 86:59)
success which was like literally the (86:57 - 87:01)
weekend it opened everywhere right like (86:59 - 87:02)
it did incredibly well opening weekend (87:01 - 87:05)
and it did well afterwards it was (87:02 - 87:06)
already like news articles were already (87:05 - 87:08)
like detective Pikachu in the works they (87:06 - 87:10)
signed like (87:08 - 87:12)
they got the rights and everything and (87:10 - 87:14)
it's like because everything has to be a (87:12 - 87:15)
series (87:14 - 87:16)
right because everything needs a sequel (87:15 - 87:20)
everything else it's been four years and (87:16 - 87:22)
we still don't really have anything to (87:20 - 87:24)
show except (87:22 - 87:26)
somebody's talking about this again so (87:24 - 87:28)
even if they were to sign stuff this (87:26 - 87:30)
year that's still what like probably (87:28 - 87:32)
another two years out (87:30 - 87:33)
um (87:32 - 87:36)
maybe a year out I mean if they want (87:33 - 87:39)
some actors a year (87:36 - 87:42)
um because like they could like they (87:39 - 87:44)
depending on who they're trying to get (87:42 - 87:46)
and who like if they're trying to get (87:44 - 87:49)
big names then that could be held up (87:46 - 87:51)
because of their scheduling but (87:49 - 87:53)
generally once they sign the paperwork (87:51 - 87:58)
they go into production pretty quick (87:53 - 88:00)
uh you're not given a ton of time to (87:58 - 88:02)
rehearse you are really given the script (88:00 - 88:04)
you get maybe a week of rehearsal and (88:02 - 88:05)
blocking because they will just keep (88:04 - 88:08)
making takes until you get it right (88:05 - 88:09)
um (88:08 - 88:10)
so (88:09 - 88:13)
the filming of live actors is usually (88:10 - 88:17)
really short right like it is easy to (88:13 - 88:19)
make live actors do 10 hour work days (88:17 - 88:21)
you film for five days and then filming (88:19 - 88:23)
is done and the rest is post-production (88:21 - 88:27)
or if something was really bad you have (88:23 - 88:29)
to re like if you have to reshoot that (88:27 - 88:30)
means like (88:29 - 88:33)
they like none of the 50 takes they took (88:30 - 88:35)
right (88:33 - 88:35)
um or that ultimately there was (88:35 - 88:39)
something wrong with the post-production (88:37 - 88:41)
and they have to go back and have you (88:39 - 88:42)
reshoot to put you in better positions (88:41 - 88:44)
to make the post-production work but (88:42 - 88:46)
like once you sign actors and get them (88:44 - 88:48)
in front of the camera that part is (88:46 - 88:51)
short they get you in and they get you (88:48 - 88:53)
out (88:51 - 88:53)
yeah and for a detective feature a lot (88:53 - 88:57)
of this would be CG anyways then it's (88:55 - 89:00)
like how long of post-production are (88:57 - 89:02)
they gonna take (89:00 - 89:02)
they'll fix it in post that is what we (89:03 - 89:07)
always say yeah they fixed Sonic and (89:05 - 89:10)
posts (89:07 - 89:10)
Sonic Boom it was pretty all right (89:11 - 89:14)
actually (89:12 - 89:17)
I didn't hate that either I thought I (89:14 - 89:21)
was I never saw it I wanted to see it (89:17 - 89:22)
I think I think it's worth like four (89:21 - 89:25)
four dollars on a you know rental (89:22 - 89:26)
service make some popcorn I think it's (89:25 - 89:28)
pretty okay could be a fun weekend movie (89:26 - 89:31)
night sometime yeah I need somebody to (89:28 - 89:33)
specifically say come over and watching (89:31 - 89:36)
the Sonic movie yeah for me to watch the (89:33 - 89:38)
sonic. (89:36 - 89:41)
it will never be a choice that I make in (89:38 - 89:43)
my own home there is never going to be a (89:41 - 89:46)
moment where I am so bored that I think (89:43 - 89:48)
you know what I want to watch (89:46 - 89:50)
a movie about a franchise I didn't play (89:48 - 89:52)
and don't care about (89:50 - 89:54)
what about Brent you don't think Brent's (89:52 - 89:57)
a huge Sonic fan down there (89:54 - 89:57)
grew up with the Genesis (89:58 - 90:01)
Nintendo does what sucks the second does (90:02 - 90:07)
what the tender don't (90:06 - 90:10)
looks like a no (90:07 - 90:10)
it says if you've never met him (90:11 - 90:17)
and he had met him multiple times (90:13 - 90:17)
I always just project this like if Greg (90:17 - 90:26)
hates it maybe Brent loves oh no here's (90:22 - 90:29)
the thing he is (90:26 - 90:32)
he's not my constant projections this is (90:29 - 90:35)
a thing that often happens (90:32 - 90:37)
I will be watching your stream and I (90:35 - 90:39)
will just have it on and then I will (90:37 - 90:41)
hear from his desk (90:39 - 90:46)
what did he just say Let It Go I do not (90:41 - 90:48)
have time for this today we cannot cover (90:46 - 90:53)
this yes I know I was ignoring it for a (90:48 - 90:56)
reason I can't I can't I'm like I will (90:53 - 90:58)
switch it's fine we'll let this moment (90:56 - 90:59)
pass (90:58 - 91:01)
laughs (90:59 - 91:04)
I've always said great interactions with (91:01 - 91:07)
Brent every time (91:04 - 91:10)
