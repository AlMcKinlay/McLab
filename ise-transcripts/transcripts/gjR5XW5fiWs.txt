[Music] (0:01 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 437th (0:25 - 0:31)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:29 - 0:33)
super effective i'm your host (0:31 - 0:36)
sbj with me greg hello (0:33 - 0:42)
i am here i am 1 500th of the way to (0:36 - 0:45)
level 40 in pokemon go you're doing it (0:42 - 0:47)
is that why you want to trade a pokemon (0:45 - 0:49)
with me this morning i did because i (0:47 - 0:50)
realized i'd never finished that jump (0:49 - 0:52)
start thing (0:50 - 0:54)
because i needed to trade and it was (0:52 - 0:55)
always close (0:54 - 0:58)
then i wasn't near anybody so then i was (0:55 - 0:59)
like oh i should just clear some of this (0:58 - 1:00)
out (0:59 - 1:04)
and that got me to one 500 millionth (1:00 - 1:06)
of the way towards the thing i'm never (1:04 - 1:07)
going to get (1:06 - 1:09)
but the thing you're never going to get (1:07 - 1:10)
being level 40 (1:09 - 1:13)
yeah 40 before the fourth year (1:10 - 1:16)
before the end of the year what why does (1:13 - 1:18)
it have to be before the end of the year (1:16 - 1:19)
because then you get the gyarados hat (1:18 - 1:22)
they get the gyarados head is now (1:19 - 1:24)
the only special thing well greg we can (1:22 - 1:27)
do this we can work on it we can do this (1:24 - 1:31)
i need people bobby to open the gift i (1:27 - 1:33)
send them (1:31 - 1:35)
you i need you to get rid of everybody (1:33 - 1:37)
you currently have as a friend (1:35 - 1:40)
in pokemon go and get 200 new friends (1:37 - 1:43)
and just be like adamant diligent and it (1:40 - 1:44)
has to start (1:43 - 1:48)
tomorrow so by december 30th you can (1:44 - 1:51)
like get to that 30-day friendship level (1:48 - 1:51)
or something (1:51 - 1:53)
i think it's too late i think you're (1:51 - 1:54)
lost out yeah i've no (1:53 - 1:57)
i mean i'm working i'm working it as (1:54 - 1:58)
hard as i can (1:57 - 2:00)
well how much xp you need from 39 to 40. (1:58 - 2:02)
two million (2:00 - 2:05)
no it's five oh five million put it i (2:02 - 2:05)
put it in (2:05 - 2:07)
twitter hold on let me go let's let's (2:05 - 2:10)
fight (2:07 - 2:12)
nobody uses twitter anymore that's 5 (2:10 - 2:14)
million divided by 30. how much xp is (2:12 - 2:14)
that today (2:14 - 2:18)
uh will is also here yeah i am (2:14 - 2:21)
and unrelated to greg's pokemon go (2:18 - 2:25)
dilemma if you go (2:21 - 2:28)
to target on the day after they restock (2:25 - 2:30)
the shelves with pokemon cards (2:28 - 2:33)
with a shopping bag and you grab 10 of (2:30 - 2:35)
them champions pass because those are (2:33 - 2:37)
the only ten they have on the shelf (2:35 - 2:40)
because they're on discount for ten (2:37 - 2:41)
dollars (2:40 - 2:43)
and then you're just going to resell (2:41 - 2:45)
them on ebay you're a bad person (2:43 - 2:48)
wait your target doesn't have a limit i (2:45 - 2:52)
but i i feel like every target i've gone (2:48 - 2:53)
to in the last (2:52 - 2:56)
30 days have had like limit to pokemon (2:53 - 2:57)
cards per person (2:56 - 3:00)
yeah i've seen that at mine but well (2:57 - 3:01)
when i was down in houston that's not (3:00 - 3:02)
what i saw (3:01 - 3:04)
it's a whole different taxes country (3:02 - 3:06)
down there uh (3:04 - 3:12)
all right i need 484 million 881 (3:06 - 3:14)
000 experience points which means i have (3:12 - 3:16)
to do (3:14 - 3:19)
162 thousand seven hundred and fourteen (3:16 - 3:21)
experience (3:19 - 3:25)
a day through the rest of this year (3:21 - 3:27)
to meet that goal okay that's like (3:25 - 3:28)
gyarados hat (3:27 - 3:31)
that's like uh that's a best friend (3:28 - 3:33)
today you said uh that's a best friend (3:31 - 3:35)
today you said 130 000 (3:33 - 3:38)
162 000 experiences well this is easy (3:35 - 3:39)
greg (3:38 - 3:41)
that's just eight raids a day because a (3:39 - 3:42)
raid gives you 20 (3:41 - 3:48)
000 with a lucky egg (3:42 - 3:48)
we do have a show for you guys the big (3:49 - 3:52)
news story is the (3:51 - 3:56)
yuri geller thing so we will get to that (3:52 - 4:00)
okay the bigger news story to me is yuri (3:56 - 4:02)
geller is still alive (4:00 - 4:05)
oh i was gonna say the bigger news story (4:02 - 4:07)
is how many people didn't know cadabra (4:05 - 4:08)
cards were (4:07 - 4:10)
not being printed that is like the (4:08 - 4:13)
actual new story (4:10 - 4:13)
the amount of people that had no clue (4:13 - 4:16)
that this was actually a thing for the (4:15 - 4:18)
last 20 years so i guess we'll talk (4:16 - 4:18)
about that (4:18 - 4:21)
i could have swore your yellow died but (4:18 - 4:22)
guess what (4:21 - 4:25)
poor james randy did before yuri geller (4:22 - 4:26)
that's like (4:25 - 4:28)
sad i figured james randy would have (4:26 - 4:30)
taken him with him (4:28 - 4:33)
one would only hope we got some uh tcg (4:30 - 4:34)
stuff (4:33 - 4:36)
some pokemon go stuff some pokemon (4:34 - 4:38)
master stuff some pokemon cafe mix (4:36 - 4:42)
stuff but let's start with the (4:38 - 4:43)
announcement (4:42 - 4:46)
of an announcement (4:43 - 4:49)
it's a very pokemon thing they love (4:46 - 4:51)
doing this (4:49 - 4:52)
so the announcement of the announcement (4:51 - 4:55)
was at the macy's thanksgiving day (4:52 - 4:55)
parade (4:55 - 4:58)
where they revealed that next year is (4:55 - 5:00)
their 25th anniversary (4:58 - 5:03)
which for probably anyone listening to (5:00 - 5:04)
show (5:03 - 5:07)
is like how is this news because we've (5:04 - 5:09)
been talking about this (5:07 - 5:11)
we know that uh you know when said sun (5:09 - 5:13)
and moon came out in 2016 (5:11 - 5:15)
that was their 20th anniversary they (5:13 - 5:16)
made a pretty big deal about that (5:15 - 5:18)
um that was the same year pokemon go (5:16 - 5:20)
launched that was (5:18 - 5:22)
uh the year of mythicals those the year (5:20 - 5:23)
sun and moon launched (5:22 - 5:25)
they did a whole brand new plush line (5:23 - 5:27)
for that i believe they opened up a (5:25 - 5:28)
brand new pokemon center in japan during (5:27 - 5:29)
that time (5:28 - 5:33)
that was also when they released xy (5:29 - 5:35)
evolutions which is their best selling (5:33 - 5:37)
tcg set of all time that was in november (5:35 - 5:39)
of 2016 that was the (5:37 - 5:42)
set where they reprinted base set (5:39 - 5:44)
and that set had like six different (5:42 - 5:46)
charizards in it (5:44 - 5:49)
so a lot of things happened in 2016 (5:46 - 5:52)
and now this is uh going to be their (5:49 - 5:53)
25th which (5:52 - 5:55)
i would say most companies do a bigger (5:53 - 5:56)
thing for their 25th (5:55 - 5:59)
than they do for their 20th i would have (5:56 - 6:00)
yes (5:59 - 6:02)
yes it's more of a more notable (6:00 - 6:04)
anniversary typically yes (6:02 - 6:05)
i'll just read what they have on (6:04 - 6:07)
pokemon.com it's really really short (6:05 - 6:08)
because again this is announcement of (6:07 - 6:09)
the announcement (6:08 - 6:12)
they said the famous pikachu sword among (6:09 - 6:14)
the skyscrapers of manhattan in the 2020 (6:12 - 6:15)
macy's (6:14 - 6:16)
thanksgiving day parade the iconic (6:15 - 6:19)
pokemon appeared holding a snowman (6:16 - 6:20)
pikachu and wearing a scarf (6:19 - 6:22)
in preparation for the cold weather a (6:20 - 6:23)
special troupe of (6:22 - 6:26)
dancing pikachu accompanied the balloon (6:23 - 6:27)
revealing the (6:26 - 6:29)
logo for the 25th anniversary coming in (6:27 - 6:30)
2021 (6:29 - 6:32)
held in new york city on thanksgiving (6:30 - 6:35)
day november 26th this is the 20th (6:32 - 6:38)
time that pikachu balloon proudly took (6:35 - 6:40)
its place in the prestigious parade (6:38 - 6:42)
have a happy holiday season we look (6:40 - 6:43)
forward to more news (6:42 - 6:45)
for the 25th anniversary here on (6:43 - 6:46)
pokemon.com (6:45 - 6:48)
overall the announcement was pretty much (6:46 - 6:50)
nothing i do think that this is a (6:48 - 6:55)
uh 700 iq play by the pokemon company (6:50 - 6:59)
big brains here uh because a lot of (6:55 - 7:02)
non-pokemon fans watch this parade (6:59 - 7:05)
and it is a good way of letting people (7:02 - 7:06)
know that (7:05 - 7:08)
next year is going to be a big year and (7:06 - 7:09)
put pokemon (7:08 - 7:13)
on their radar early i i don't know i (7:09 - 7:14)
guess this stuff works like (7:13 - 7:16)
i know like for me personally like (7:14 - 7:18)
harley davidson is here in milwaukee (7:16 - 7:19)
where i live (7:18 - 7:21)
and the only time i really hear a lot (7:19 - 7:23)
about harley davidson is like every five (7:21 - 7:24)
years when it's one of their (7:23 - 7:25)
anniversaries (7:24 - 7:26)
because they like they make a big deal (7:25 - 7:28)
about it in the city like every (7:26 - 7:31)
the 30th the 35th the 40th i'm not sure (7:28 - 7:32)
what the year they're on i think they're (7:31 - 7:33)
over 50. (7:32 - 7:36)
they've been around a while yeah i guess (7:33 - 7:37)
this this makes sense (7:36 - 7:40)
to to put that seed out there for people (7:37 - 7:43)
so canto remakes next year we can only (7:40 - 7:46)
hope 25 years play it again (7:43 - 7:47)
okay so what what would they have on the (7:46 - 7:50)
docket next year they would have pokemon (7:47 - 7:50)
unite (7:50 - 7:53)
is that going to happen yeah i don't see (7:50 - 7:54)
they're already (7:53 - 7:55)
the only thing that's not going to (7:54 - 7:57)
happen is pokemon sleep yeah (7:55 - 7:59)
yeah if you're in china you can play it (7:57 - 8:01)
technically (7:59 - 8:03)
um because they're pokemon sleep no um (8:01 - 8:04)
unite (8:03 - 8:05)
oh cause they have they have a beta (8:04 - 8:08)
program going on right now um so unite (8:05 - 8:12)
snap pokemon snap uh detective pikachu (8:08 - 8:14)
the new pokemon snap thank you very much (8:12 - 8:16)
sorry the new pokemon snap (8:14 - 8:17)
so that's that's three games right there (8:16 - 8:20)
unite snap detective pikachu (8:17 - 8:22)
um maybe sleep so that's four (8:20 - 8:24)
[Laughter] (8:22 - 8:26)
sleep is not happening they've never (8:24 - 8:28)
talked about it again (8:26 - 8:31)
that's true i will say that um for what (8:28 - 8:31)
it's worth (8:31 - 8:33)
the company working on pokemon sleep (8:31 - 8:35)
also made magikarp jump and magikarp (8:33 - 8:38)
jump did have an update last week (8:35 - 8:40)
somebody hit the button they meant to (8:38 - 8:41)
hit two years ago yeah (8:40 - 8:44)
so uh that's probably a good sign that's (8:41 - 8:46)
actually probably that's expansion (8:44 - 8:49)
no it was it just fixed uh a bug i think (8:46 - 8:52)
on ios 14. (8:49 - 8:52)
but that that is legit a good sign you (8:53 - 8:56)
know if they weren't (8:55 - 8:57)
if they didn't have a contract with a (8:56 - 8:59)
pokemon company they probably wouldn't (8:57 - 9:00)
have been able to (8:59 - 9:03)
update or whatever or it wouldn't care (9:00 - 9:04)
to update (9:03 - 9:07)
because why bother at that point i would (9:04 - 9:07)
probably (9:07 - 9:11)
expect another new mobile game right (9:07 - 9:12)
they've been pretty much putting out one (9:11 - 9:14)
mobile game a year maybe (9:12 - 9:15)
well i guess maybe that's unique it's (9:14 - 9:17)
gonna be it's not gonna be a tower (9:15 - 9:19)
defense game i'm out no no no no we're (9:17 - 9:21)
getting a new expansion of pokemon (9:19 - 9:22)
shuffle (9:21 - 9:24)
a new version of shuffle i still (9:22 - 9:26)
strongly believe they're going to really (9:24 - 9:28)
push forward with their live events (9:26 - 9:29)
especially with pokemon go (9:28 - 9:32)
regardless of the world probably a game (9:29 - 9:33)
on switch (9:32 - 9:35)
i can't imagine that their 25th (9:33 - 9:36)
anniversary (9:35 - 9:37)
they're not going to put a game on (9:36 - 9:40)
switch whether that's (9:37 - 9:41)
the only thing i i would be confident (9:40 - 9:44)
saying it won't be is a generation nine (9:41 - 9:46)
they usually like their generations to (9:44 - 9:47)
breathe and yeah get their mileage up (9:46 - 9:51)
yeah so yeah it is going to be a dlc (9:47 - 9:53)
for sword and shield that brings you to (9:51 - 9:56)
kanto oh my god (9:53 - 9:56)
perfect well i would have i would i (9:57 - 10:01)
suppose all the announcements are (10:00 - 10:03)
probably going to be made (10:01 - 10:05)
in february because that's pokemon days (10:03 - 10:06)
february 28th (10:05 - 10:08)
i wouldn't be surprised yeah february (10:06 - 10:11)
28th i think saw my anniversary (10:08 - 10:14)
because that's when the green and (10:11 - 10:18)
red came out in japan japan yep (10:14 - 10:19)
i would not be surprised actually (10:18 - 10:21)
february 27th i know (10:19 - 10:24)
it's the 20th century my bad i would not (10:21 - 10:25)
be surprised (10:24 - 10:27)
if they are to do another detective (10:25 - 10:28)
pikachu movie (10:27 - 10:31)
if we hear about it next year not (10:28 - 10:33)
necessarily we get it but (10:31 - 10:35)
we at least hear about it oh they're (10:33 - 10:37)
probably going to put the rude movie out (10:35 - 10:39)
on like pokemon day aren't they (10:37 - 10:42)
yeah um that'd be a good call because (10:39 - 10:44)
yeah it's probably not gonna happen for (10:42 - 10:45)
christmas no (10:44 - 10:47)
well japan will get it for christmas i (10:45 - 10:49)
think it's in theaters in japan so (10:47 - 10:50)
good luck (10:49 - 10:52)
[Laughter] (10:50 - 10:54)
i don't know what a japanese movie (10:52 - 10:56)
theater looks like though i don't either (10:54 - 10:57)
does it look like an american movie (10:56 - 10:58)
theater (10:57 - 11:00)
or does it look like some what else (10:58 - 11:01)
would it look like (11:00 - 11:04)
i don't know like some spaceship (11:01 - 11:06)
they're in the face japan's always ahead (11:04 - 11:08)
of us right they got (11:06 - 11:09)
is it like a karaoke booth where you'd (11:08 - 11:11)
have a couch and a screen and four (11:09 - 11:12)
people (11:11 - 11:13)
because i'd be into that that'd be (11:12 - 11:16)
actually pretty cool (11:13 - 11:20)
i mean it looks the same it looks (11:16 - 11:22)
it looks just like ours oh bummer wait (11:20 - 11:23)
this is wait (11:22 - 11:25)
hold on there's a mini theater is this (11:23 - 11:27)
actually in japan (11:25 - 11:31)
no oh wait a mini theater is a type of (11:27 - 11:33)
japanese independent movie theater that (11:31 - 11:33)
is (11:33 - 11:35)
not under the direct influence of major (11:33 - 11:37)
any major film companies (11:35 - 11:41)
it still looks like our theater hmm (11:37 - 11:45)
it's not mini in any way yeah the tokyo (11:41 - 11:47)
theater looks like (11:45 - 11:50)
the same like i'm not seeing this is (11:47 - 11:51)
gripping (11:50 - 11:53)
i am content i am curious if they're (11:51 - 11:55)
going to do anything for sword and (11:53 - 11:55)
shield (11:55 - 12:00)
because yeah i (11:55 - 12:00)
just seems like that's a long time (12:00 - 12:03)
between i mean we had a full year of (12:02 - 12:04)
sword and shield (12:03 - 12:06)
during that full year we had two (12:04 - 12:09)
expansions assuming that another pokemon (12:06 - 12:11)
game comes out in the (12:09 - 12:14)
fall which is not always the case but (12:11 - 12:15)
mostly the case (12:14 - 12:17)
true that's a whole year of nothing and (12:15 - 12:18)
i don't (12:17 - 12:21)
as much as i love the free or the (12:18 - 12:23)
as much as i love the promoted raid (12:21 - 12:24)
weekends they do once a month or they (12:23 - 12:26)
have been doing once a month (12:24 - 12:28)
um that's obviously doesn't appeal to (12:26 - 12:29)
everyone (12:28 - 12:31)
and they keep rotating the seasons of (12:29 - 12:34)
what pokemon are allowed and not allowed (12:31 - 12:36)
uh and i think series seven which is the (12:34 - 12:38)
current rule set goes till the end of (12:36 - 12:39)
january (12:38 - 12:40)
but again that also doesn't appeal to (12:39 - 12:43)
everyone i i don't personally think (12:40 - 12:44)
there's going to be like this (12:43 - 12:47)
final expansion that adds the remaining (12:44 - 12:50)
260 missing pokemon i don't see that oh (12:47 - 12:51)
heck no (12:50 - 12:53)
but i don't i don't know what else they (12:51 - 12:54)
would do (12:53 - 12:57)
i already told you the kanto tickets (12:54 - 12:58)
coming (12:57 - 13:02)
a train from from uh (12:58 - 13:05)
europe to japan yep a bullet train from (13:02 - 13:06)
europe to japan (13:05 - 13:08)
it goes under the sea it goes it goes (13:06 - 13:10)
through kalos though you'll be able to (13:08 - 13:10)
see (13:10 - 13:13)
kalos on your way to canto that's what (13:10 - 13:14)
they're going to do (13:13 - 13:17)
because remember on that that section of (13:14 - 13:19)
the kalos map there was the train (13:17 - 13:20)
station that went nowhere (13:19 - 13:22)
oh my gosh this is literally (13:20 - 13:24)
conversations people on (13:22 - 13:27)
[Laughter] (13:24 - 13:30)

pokemon battle revolution was fun it was (16:21 - 16:26)
just not enough fun for them yeah it was (16:23 - 16:28)
it was like it was like it's just so (16:26 - 16:30)
expensive it was like if you (16:28 - 16:33)
if you bought just the uh just the dojo (16:30 - 16:34)

and you're not allowed to leave this (16:41 - 16:45)
building well (16:43 - 16:47)
sounds like it's appropriate for this (16:45 - 16:48)
day and age (16:47 - 16:51)
okay i mean it did give us a great sound (16:48 - 16:52)
board though (16:51 - 16:54)
that's true it's how we know how to say (16:52 - 16:55)
milotic (16:54 - 16:57)
correctly speaking of announcements for (16:55 - 16:58)
announcements (16:57 - 17:01)
uh let's switch over to some pokemon go (16:58 - 17:05)
news real quick (17:01 - 17:08)
a couple hours ago niantic tweeted a (17:05 - 17:12)
raid with a 48 hour timer above it (17:08 - 17:14)
as of us recording this podcast the (17:12 - 17:15)
timer has like (17:14 - 17:19)
28 hours left or something and it said (17:15 - 17:20)
like incoming transmission (17:19 - 17:23)
and then it showed the timer um and then (17:20 - 17:24)
it showed a (17:23 - 17:27)
pink egg which if you don't know your (17:24 - 17:29)
colors off the top of your head (17:27 - 17:31)
the pink eggs are one star eggs used to (17:29 - 17:32)
be two star (17:31 - 17:34)
eggs as well but they got rid of two (17:32 - 17:36)
stars um the yellow eggs are three star (17:34 - 17:37)
eggs (17:36 - 17:40)
and then the whatever the the (17:37 - 17:43)
legendary then mega so legendary is the (17:40 - 17:44)
silver eggs and then mega (17:43 - 17:50)
is the weird mega dna egg looking things (17:44 - 17:52)
i guess they're tan but then they glow (17:50 - 17:55)
colors there are four eggs in pokemon go (17:52 - 17:58)
and this is a pink one they made a (17:55 - 18:01)
40 second video of this egg spinning so (17:58 - 18:03)
i would assume that somebody at niantic (18:01 - 18:05)
didn't pick the wrong color although i (18:03 - 18:07)
wouldn't put it past them (18:05 - 18:09)
what's on the banner on the plane that (18:07 - 18:11)
flies past oh i can explain this (18:09 - 18:13)
um so they had two trailers for this (18:11 - 18:15)
announcement of the announcement (18:13 - 18:17)
if uh if you're wondering when the 48 (18:15 - 18:18)
hours is supposed to end (18:17 - 18:21)
it ends during (18:18 - 18:24)
it ends the day the kalos pokemon get (18:21 - 18:26)
added to the game which is december 1st (18:24 - 18:26)
i think (18:26 - 18:28)
and this is what we talked about last (18:26 - 18:30)
week with bobby which uh (18:28 - 18:31)
bobby thought the egg was going to be (18:30 - 18:33)
scatterbug and i said (18:31 - 18:36)
um i don't know if that seems right and (18:33 - 18:36)
then (18:36 - 18:39)
i forgot what greg and i speculated i (18:36 - 18:39)
was (18:39 - 18:43)
i'm still on furforu so oh yeah for free (18:39 - 18:44)
for free and i'll get all the haircuts (18:43 - 18:46)
and you're all like never gonna be perfu (18:44 - 18:49)
um so shoot down all my good ideas so i (18:46 - 18:52)
i tweeted this yesterday but uh right (18:49 - 18:54)
before the trip but right before it (18:52 - 18:55)
flickers to the egg (18:54 - 18:57)
it flickers to the psychic background on (18:55 - 18:59)
psychic pokemon (18:57 - 19:02)
there's a there's only like 78 new (18:59 - 19:04)
pokemon in kalos or something like that (19:02 - 19:05)
there's not a lot of them that are not (19:04 - 19:07)
that many psychic um but there is one (19:05 - 19:09)
psychic pokemon that stands out (19:07 - 19:11)
and then if you watch the second trailer (19:09 - 19:13)
there's a there's a plane (19:11 - 19:15)
that is flying and there's a number on (19:13 - 19:16)
the plane (19:15 - 19:18)
and that number is the same number as (19:16 - 19:20)
esper's pokedex number (19:18 - 19:21)
oh (19:20 - 19:23)
[Applause] (19:21 - 19:27)
it's like uh 677 or something like that (19:23 - 19:30)
i love the internet because you can (19:27 - 19:31)
watch (19:30 - 19:34)
you can watch people set their own (19:31 - 19:36)
expectations and then you can watch them (19:34 - 19:39)
48 hours later get extremely mad (19:36 - 19:43)
at everyone but themselves let me give (19:39 - 19:44)
you an example (19:43 - 19:46)
yesterday when they first showed this (19:44 - 19:49)
trailer the amount of comments i saw of (19:46 - 19:51)
oh it's going to be mew and they're (19:49 - 19:54)
going to turn it shiny finally (19:51 - 19:56)
okay yeah sure i'm sure niantic's going (19:54 - 19:57)
to put mu in a one star raid (19:56 - 20:00)
or maybe yeah i'm sure they forgot that (19:57 - 20:01)
uh (20:00 - 20:02)
maybe that mythical pokemon shouldn't be (20:01 - 20:04)
in a pink egg and it should maybe be in (20:02 - 20:05)
a silver egg or something but yeah sure (20:04 - 20:06)
maybe mew (20:05 - 20:08)
oh they're bringing back mewtwo okay (20:06 - 20:10)
well let's apply the first logic to that (20:08 - 20:13)
as well um mewtwo has always been in the (20:10 - 20:15)
silver legendary raid but yeah sure (20:13 - 20:16)
maybe the (20:15 - 20:18)
who they just messed up maybe pink egg (20:16 - 20:19)
no big deal (20:18 - 20:22)
uh i liked hoopa that was a good that (20:19 - 20:23)
was a good one too (20:22 - 20:24)
[Laughter] (20:23 - 20:27)
zygarde as well oh gosh what else did (20:24 - 20:29)
people suggest those are the (20:27 - 20:30)
those are the four that i saw a lot was (20:29 - 20:33)
mew with being shiny of course (20:30 - 20:36)
mewtwo zygarde and hoopa oh the other (20:33 - 20:38)
one i saw a lot was galerion slowpoke (20:36 - 20:41)
which gallerian slowpoke would pick the (20:38 - 20:42)
would fit a pink egg (20:41 - 20:45)
a one star raid but (20:42 - 20:49)
i just why would you (20:45 - 20:52)
release a pokemon debuted in gen 8 (20:49 - 20:55)
on the day you're promoting gen 6. (20:52 - 20:58)
just yeah very true so now that we've (20:55 - 20:59)
seen (20:58 - 21:01)
now fast forward to today because all of (20:59 - 21:02)
those speculations were (21:01 - 21:03)
yesterday and i think people have (21:02 - 21:05)
finally accepted its esper because of (21:03 - 21:06)
the number (21:05 - 21:08)
in the background and now people are mad (21:06 - 21:09)
because (21:08 - 21:12)
why would niantic hype up esper this (21:09 - 21:16)
dex filler pokemon (21:12 - 21:18)
there are there are plenty of things (21:16 - 21:20)
that niantic has done slash the pokemon (21:18 - 21:21)
company has done that (21:20 - 21:23)
that has definitely surprised me but (21:21 - 21:26)
esper is not one of them i feel like (21:23 - 21:29)
i remember the launch of x and y pretty (21:26 - 21:30)
well (21:29 - 21:32)
and i remember that people wouldn't shut (21:30 - 21:34)
up about esper (21:32 - 21:37)
like out of out of all the new pokemon (21:34 - 21:40)
esper was talked about a lot (21:37 - 21:42)
there's a lot of fan art of esper there (21:40 - 21:43)
was a lot of (21:42 - 21:46)
memes with esper well yeah cause it's (21:43 - 21:47)
got those eyes (21:46 - 21:50)
yeah yeah they just kind of stare it (21:47 - 21:51)
probably had (21:50 - 21:53)
dead eyes the most merchandise of any (21:51 - 21:55)
pokemon that wasn't a starter or a (21:53 - 21:56)
legendary (21:55 - 21:59)
in that generation as well so yeah i (21:56 - 21:59)
don't know (21:59 - 22:02)
you could say like why hype up esper why (21:59 - 22:06)
make mareep so rare like (22:02 - 22:06)
it's just a sheep yeah it's like like (22:07 - 22:10)
marie (22:10 - 22:12)
is like one of the first sheep you find (22:10 - 22:14)
in gold and silver (22:12 - 22:16)
like it's why why did they make it so (22:14 - 22:17)
rare i don't know why (22:16 - 22:20)
why did they put vullabay a pokemon that (22:17 - 22:23)
no one really cares about in (22:20 - 22:26)
12k team rocket eggs like this like that (22:23 - 22:29)
question is kind of (22:26 - 22:32)
silly because like that in itself is (22:29 - 22:34)
something not new (22:32 - 22:38)
how pokemon go treats just random (22:34 - 22:40)
pokemons (22:38 - 22:41)
and they do they they have been (22:40 - 22:43)
successful with it right like people (22:41 - 22:45)
do care when they see him a reap in the (22:43 - 22:46)
wild people (22:45 - 22:49)
did care when they say they saw a gibble (22:46 - 22:50)
in the wild like (22:49 - 22:52)
in past pokemon games gibbel is not that (22:50 - 22:53)
hard to find (22:52 - 22:55)
heck and sword and shield you find a (22:53 - 22:56)
cave with 40 (22:55 - 22:59)
gibbles running around you like also (22:56 - 23:01)
like pokemon go has (22:59 - 23:04)
has made shanks this pokemon that people (23:01 - 23:06)
are willing to spend one dollar on (23:04 - 23:06)
because hey (23:06 - 23:09)
it's only in raids and it could be shiny (23:06 - 23:11)
so (23:09 - 23:13)
i think it's fine it's whatever like i (23:11 - 23:15)
remember how many dollars did you spend (23:13 - 23:16)
for your shiny (23:15 - 23:18)
shanks (23:16 - 23:18)
i know you keep track of every dollar (23:19 - 23:23)
you sp dollar per pokemon i think the (23:21 - 23:24)
most (23:23 - 23:25)
free range i know exactly how much you (23:24 - 23:27)
spent for uh (23:25 - 23:31)
d-axis uh was it turakion (23:27 - 23:34)
um i hadn't spent that much for trayaki (23:31 - 23:35)
and i think i only spent eight bucks on (23:34 - 23:36)
him (23:35 - 23:37)
you spent like a billion dollars for (23:36 - 23:41)
deoxys i did yeah diaxis was my (23:37 - 23:43)
was my uh uh the only one that i really (23:41 - 23:44)
spent a lot on (23:43 - 23:47)
yeah i probably probably eight dollar (23:44 - 23:49)
like i i usually only use (23:47 - 23:52)
free raid passes on like uh shinx unless (23:49 - 23:53)
there's a bunch of people around and (23:52 - 23:54)
they're like oh drop out those strings (23:53 - 23:56)
with us and i was like all right (23:54 - 23:59)
peer pressure so i guess get excited for (23:56 - 24:00)
esper (23:59 - 24:04)
okay i will finish the uh pokemon go (24:00 - 24:05)
news here real quick not a lot of (24:04 - 24:07)

and we are back let's do the (29:48 - 29:54)
the yuri geller stuff so let's uh we're (29:51 - 29:56)
gonna trace this back a little bit (29:54 - 29:57)
because on (29:56 - 30:00)
saturday this news kind of broke (29:57 - 30:03)
but uh it actually started a little bit (30:00 - 30:04)
before that i believe it started on (30:03 - 30:05)
friday (30:04 - 30:07)
and i believe the source was because of (30:05 - 30:08)
an article on (30:07 - 30:12)
the gamer what is the gamer (30:08 - 30:15)
uh a website uh i can tell you at the (30:12 - 30:17)
top of their website they have (30:15 - 30:20)
gen shin impact tg originals which i'm (30:17 - 30:22)
assuming is the gamer originals game (30:20 - 30:25)
news guides reviews more (30:22 - 30:29)
uh this is written by josh kolluson (30:25 - 30:31)
and it's titled why there hasn't been a (30:29 - 30:34)
cadabra pokemon card for almost (30:31 - 30:36)
20 years which is correct i believe it's (30:34 - 30:37)
been 19 years (30:36 - 30:40)
so and then it starts off with update (30:37 - 30:41)
geller has (30:40 - 30:43)
since reached out to the gamer to (30:41 - 30:45)
comment on the situation we'll get to (30:43 - 30:47)
that first let's uh go over this article (30:45 - 30:49)
cadabra hasn't appeared on a pokemon (30:47 - 30:51)
card since the early 2000s i think (30:49 - 30:53)
exactly 2001 (30:51 - 30:56)
in the very last (30:53 - 30:59)
set that wizards of the coast printed (30:56 - 31:00)
which i can't remember what that said (30:59 - 31:02)
it's called off the top of my head but (31:00 - 31:03)
the reason that cadabra hasn't appeared (31:02 - 31:05)
is thanks to the spoon bending (31:03 - 31:07)
illusionist yuri geller (31:05 - 31:08)
pokemon cards weren't just something (31:07 - 31:11)
kids bought frantically in the late 90s (31:08 - 31:13)
as the case with pretty much everything (31:11 - 31:14)
pokemon has put their name on (31:13 - 31:16)
the tcg has continued to grow into (31:14 - 31:18)
something bigger we can only only (31:16 - 31:21)
imagine now close to a thousand pokemon (31:18 - 31:23)
that's not the case for cadabra though (31:21 - 31:25)
the first gen psychic pokemon hasn't (31:23 - 31:28)
been on a pokemon card of its very own (31:25 - 31:30)
since the early 2000s not (31:28 - 31:31)
because it's waiting in line for its (31:30 - 31:33)
next opportunity but because the real (31:31 - 31:34)
life person (31:33 - 31:38)
it is based on in japan cadabra's name (31:34 - 31:38)
is (31:38 - 31:41)
junger younger (31:38 - 31:43)
it gets that along with the spoons found (31:41 - 31:45)
in its hands from the (31:43 - 31:48)
illusionist yuri geller not so much from (31:45 - 31:49)
geller per se (31:48 - 31:51)
it was more of a case of pokemon's (31:49 - 31:52)
creators naming (31:51 - 31:54)
cadabra without the magician without (31:52 - 31:56)
letting the magician know (31:54 - 31:58)
it didn't sit well with geller and at (31:56 - 32:00)
the turn of the century he decided to (31:58 - 32:00)
take (32:00 - 32:03)
legal action geller not only sued (32:00 - 32:05)
nintendo in 2000 for basing cadabra on (32:03 - 32:06)
him (32:05 - 32:08)
but he requested that pokemon stop he (32:06 - 32:10)
requested the pokemon stop being (32:08 - 32:13)
used in the tcg here we are 20 years (32:10 - 32:14)
later (32:13 - 32:16)
and it would appear that the ruling (32:14 - 32:18)
still stands (32:16 - 32:20)
since cadabra is the middle evolution (32:18 - 32:21)
pokemon (32:20 - 32:24)
including abra and alakazam geller's (32:21 - 32:24)
lawsuit (32:24 - 32:26)
only proved problematic for three (32:24 - 32:28)
pokemon rather than one (32:26 - 32:31)
even though both appear in the tcg their (32:28 - 32:33)
inclusion is problematic since cadabra (32:31 - 32:34)
cannot join them (32:33 - 32:36)
there have been workarounds over the (32:34 - 32:38)
years which is true you there's plenty (32:36 - 32:40)
of alakazam cards that (32:38 - 32:44)
just or alakazam or just abra rare candy (32:40 - 32:46)
cadet (32:44 - 32:46)
abra rare candy alakazam abra was (32:46 - 32:51)
included in the mysterious treasure set (32:49 - 32:52)
ah that was the set (32:51 - 32:54)
that was the last set it was in last set (32:52 - 32:56)
that magic uh wizard to the coast (32:54 - 32:56)
printed (32:56 - 32:58)
pokemon eliminated the problem of (32:56 - 33:00)
kadabra's uh absence by giving (32:58 - 33:03)
abra the ability to leapfrog straight (33:00 - 33:04)
into alakazam (33:03 - 33:07)
as for cadabra's evolved form it also (33:04 - 33:08)
has appeared (33:07 - 33:10)
sporadically over sporadically (33:08 - 33:12)
sporadically over the years however (33:10 - 33:14)
yep when it does make an appearance it (33:12 - 33:16)
is a basic pokemon so it doesn't need to (33:14 - 33:17)
have (33:16 - 33:19)
the evolved form of cadabra alakazam has (33:17 - 33:20)
appeared in ex (33:19 - 33:22)
and in v cards that's true there's just (33:20 - 33:23)
there's in the (33:22 - 33:26)
newest set vivid voltage there is (33:23 - 33:27)
alakazam (33:26 - 33:30)
v needless to say cadabra cards are (33:27 - 33:32)
pretty hard to come by (33:30 - 33:33)
and that was pretty much the entire (33:32 - 33:35)
article there's not a lot to it right (33:33 - 33:36)
it's just (33:35 - 33:40)
a pretty general (33:36 - 33:43)
article that says it doesn't really go (33:40 - 33:45)
into the lawsuit (33:43 - 33:47)
it kind of just talks about the last set (33:45 - 33:49)
it was in some new cards (33:47 - 33:52)
but i guess yuri geller saw (33:49 - 33:56)
said article and then commented on it he (33:52 - 33:57)
tweeted he commented (33:56 - 34:00)
uh on it but he pretty much let me see (33:57 - 34:02)
if i can get his exact tweet here (34:00 - 34:06)
his exact tweet is i am truly sorry for (34:02 - 34:08)
what i did 20 years ago kids and (34:06 - 34:09)
grown-ups (34:08 - 34:11)
i am releasing the ban it's all up to (34:09 - 34:12)
ninten (34:11 - 34:15)
nintendo to bring back my hashtag (34:12 - 34:16)
kadabra (34:15 - 34:19)
pokemon card back it will probably be (34:16 - 34:20)
one of the rarest (34:19 - 34:23)
cards now much energy and love and then (34:20 - 34:23)
they (34:23 - 34:27)
and then he posted his website uh yuri (34:23 - 34:28)
gellermuseum.com (34:27 - 34:33)
that's kind of it yeah so basically (34:28 - 34:35)
he has realized that he's completely (34:33 - 34:36)
irrelevant (34:35 - 34:40)
and was like let me grasp at straws by (34:36 - 34:42)
trying to attach myself to this very (34:40 - 34:46)
popular uh franchise or (34:42 - 34:49)
you know media conglomerate (34:46 - 34:51)
oh i made a i made a mistake i'm sorry (34:49 - 34:52)
sky ridge was the last time (34:51 - 34:56)
cadabra appeared uh which was 2002 (34:52 - 34:59)
in japan so about 18 years ago do you (34:56 - 35:00)
think though like (34:59 - 35:04)
i mean i'm sure he was mad obviously he (35:00 - 35:05)
sued nintendo (35:04 - 35:09)
uh for for his likeness (35:05 - 35:10)
but he probably just forgot about it (35:09 - 35:12)
right well (35:10 - 35:14)
i mean i think he sat on it thinking (35:12 - 35:16)
that at some point they would come (35:14 - 35:18)
through with money and instead they're (35:16 - 35:19)
just like (35:18 - 35:23)
or no we're gonna we're just never gonna (35:19 - 35:25)
print it again like (35:23 - 35:28)
we'll just work around it and then it's (35:25 - 35:30)
interesting that after the 25th (35:28 - 35:31)
anniversary is announced (35:30 - 35:33)
he comes forward and says oh hey you can (35:31 - 35:35)
let this happen again (35:33 - 35:37)
so i'm sure the 25th anniversary did its (35:35 - 35:38)
job (35:37 - 35:40)
to remind everybody that this is a thing (35:38 - 35:42)
and i'm sure he's just like i'm sick of (35:40 - 35:43)
getting this (35:42 - 35:46)
these mail also i'm not relevant (35:43 - 35:48)
and certain segments of the population (35:46 - 35:49)
think i'm dead (35:48 - 35:52)
i might as well at least grab a bit (35:49 - 35:56)
of headlines right after the 25th (35:52 - 35:57)
anniversary hits and everybody's talking (35:56 - 35:58)
about it (35:57 - 36:01)
yeah i can see that i just love the fact (35:58 - 36:02)
that it's we'll bring (36:01 - 36:06)
my kadabra yours (36:02 - 36:06)
no it doesn't belong to you okay so the (36:07 - 36:12)
the actual news here is the amount of (36:10 - 36:13)
people that didn't realize that there (36:12 - 36:16)
hasn't been a cadaver card in 18 years (36:13 - 36:18)
well i mean that is the news right there (36:16 - 36:19)
yeah that's that's the (36:18 - 36:21)
that's the actual news yeah because over (36:19 - 36:23)
there there's been plenty of ways to (36:21 - 36:26)
you know like rare candy abilities (36:23 - 36:28)
um v cards ex cards there's been plenty (36:26 - 36:31)
of ways to play alakazam i don't (36:28 - 36:33)
think there's ever been a like there's (36:31 - 36:34)
probably been like one or two (36:33 - 36:37)
okay alakazams but i i can't think of (36:34 - 36:39)
any off the top of my head that saw like (36:37 - 36:40)
a lot of play regardless (36:39 - 36:43)
but at the time pokemon was the biggest (36:40 - 36:45)
thing in the world when he did this (36:43 - 36:46)
lawsuit (36:45 - 36:49)
yeah i'm gonna pull the snorlax (36:46 - 36:50)
monster's tweet who (36:49 - 36:54)
who works with bubblepedia and i and um (36:50 - 36:56)
he's been on the show before but (36:54 - 36:58)
uh his exact tweet is he had a really (36:56 - 37:00)
solid case they based the pokemon almost (36:58 - 37:01)
directly on his likeness with the (37:00 - 37:02)
japanese name being (37:01 - 37:05)
almost exactly the same as his name and (37:02 - 37:07)
he performed his signature trick which (37:05 - 37:08)
is (37:07 - 37:10)
the bending of the spoons you have a (37:08 - 37:12)
pokemon that's like based on you (37:10 - 37:13)
doing the thing that you do which is (37:12 - 37:15)
bending spoons and now (37:13 - 37:17)
the the thing is the biggest thing in (37:15 - 37:18)
the world at the time (37:17 - 37:21)
and you're not seeing any money or no (37:18 - 37:22)
one asked you (37:21 - 37:25)
or it's also the same as like (37:22 - 37:28)
hitmonlee and hitmonchan bruce lee and (37:25 - 37:31)
jackie chan i almost said produce chan (37:28 - 37:33)
bruce lee and bruce chan (37:31 - 37:36)
and jackie lee i mean let's did they (37:33 - 37:39)
see pokemon no they didn't let's be fair (37:36 - 37:40)
bending spoons (37:39 - 37:43)
happened and has existed long before (37:40 - 37:44)
yuri geller (37:43 - 37:47)
like people claiming that oh they stole (37:44 - 37:48)
his trick (37:47 - 37:51)
no it's one of the things he does (37:48 - 37:54)
the problem was the name he also didn't (37:51 - 37:55)
like (37:54 - 37:57)
the star in the forehead and the (37:55 - 37:59)
lightning patterns because (37:57 - 38:02)
he felt that uh (37:59 - 38:06)
those were um symbolism for the ss (38:02 - 38:08)
which it's a bit of a stretch in being (38:06 - 38:11)
israeli like that was part of his whole (38:08 - 38:15)
thing and he didn't feel like they (38:11 - 38:17)
a they were honoring him with the name (38:15 - 38:18)
and b that they were (38:17 - 38:22)
uh mocking him by picking highly (38:18 - 38:26)
charged imagery on this pokemon there's (38:22 - 38:28)
a lot of stretching in there except for (38:26 - 38:29)
the name (38:28 - 38:31)
yeah the name they really should have (38:29 - 38:32)
done something (38:31 - 38:36)
different i mean it's cl it's close (38:32 - 38:38)
enough that people are like oh i can see (38:36 - 38:38)
it (38:38 - 38:41)
but i think and i think a lot of people (38:38 - 38:43)
and the ninja company included (38:41 - 38:46)
things like bending spoons has existed (38:43 - 38:47)
since (38:46 - 38:49)
ever when when people trying to rip (38:47 - 38:50)
people off (38:49 - 38:52)
exist like all time like when spoons (38:50 - 38:54)
were invented and became metal they've (38:52 - 38:57)
been scamming people over this trick (38:54 - 38:59)
forever especially you know victorian (38:57 - 39:01)
area when the whole psychic thing was (38:59 - 39:02)
huge (39:01 - 39:04)
it was a weak it was a weak case except (39:02 - 39:06)
for the name which is why they just let (39:04 - 39:07)
it sit (39:06 - 39:10)
like he if he had a strong case it (39:07 - 39:12)
wouldn't have sat for 20 years (39:10 - 39:14)
do you think bruce lee jackie chan would (39:12 - 39:16)
have had a better slash equal case with (39:14 - 39:18)
hitmonlee hitmonchan (39:16 - 39:20)
no because those pokemon don't look like (39:18 - 39:22)
them yeah (39:20 - 39:24)
and and honestly you can honestly say in (39:22 - 39:25)
all of asia (39:24 - 39:28)
there's lots of lees and there's lots of (39:25 - 39:29)
chances (39:28 - 39:31)
i mean they based the name off of their (39:29 - 39:33)
fighting style (39:31 - 39:36)
which it kind of get that whole that (39:33 - 39:37)
whole area is really (39:36 - 39:41)
gray with fair use and parody and blah (39:37 - 39:42)
blah blah like (39:41 - 39:43)
there's a lot of gray area and there's (39:42 - 39:45)
not a lot (39:43 - 39:48)
his case was based on your defaming my (39:45 - 39:49)
character (39:48 - 39:53)
and that is not easily proved by (39:49 - 39:56)
anything that is in there like that is (39:53 - 39:58)
part of the reason why the case has just (39:56 - 39:59)
literally gone nowhere (39:58 - 40:01)
because you still have to prove that (39:59 - 40:02)
it's causing harm to you (40:01 - 40:06)
like his whole idea is that it made him (40:02 - 40:07)
the laughingstock (40:06 - 40:11)
news flash you already were yeah whether (40:07 - 40:13)
or not you believed that (40:11 - 40:15)
this didn't add or take away from that (40:13 - 40:16)
which is (40:15 - 40:19)
why it's literally gone nowhere i mean (40:16 - 40:20)
it's been sitting in court waiting for (40:19 - 40:22)
an agreement (40:20 - 40:25)
until he finally gave up i mean if if he (40:22 - 40:27)
had a solid solid case (40:25 - 40:29)
they would have had to have fixed (40:27 - 40:30)
everything (40:29 - 40:32)
they would have had to removed it from (40:30 - 40:34)
the games they would have had to remove (40:32 - 40:34)
it (40:34 - 40:37)
or pay him a lot of money he didn't have (40:34 - 40:38)
a solid case (40:37 - 40:42)
he still doesn't yeah so it's so (40:38 - 40:45)
i i get frustrated people like oh you (40:42 - 40:47)
totally like (40:45 - 40:49)
no it's not totally you are making the (40:47 - 40:50)
leap that (40:49 - 40:53)
he made but it's also a leap you don't (40:50 - 40:54)
have to make (40:53 - 40:57)
like when somebody points it out and (40:54 - 40:58)
then you're like oh yeah i see it oh (40:57 - 40:59)
yeah i see it (40:58 - 41:01)
but you didn't immediately thank yuri (40:59 - 41:03)
geller when you saw that pokemon (41:01 - 41:05)
no because yuri geller is all but (41:03 - 41:06)
forgotten (41:05 - 41:09)
right today's kids that's why that's why (41:06 - 41:10)
i like love your guys's input (41:09 - 41:13)
it's because i remember i was so the (41:10 - 41:14)
last card was (41:13 - 41:18)
2004 2002 (41:14 - 41:22)
so i would have been 13 14 years old (41:18 - 41:25)
and like i remember i remember (41:22 - 41:28)
them talking about yuri geller and (41:25 - 41:29)
cadabra at the time (41:28 - 41:31)
i remember that like oh that dude's a (41:29 - 41:32)
magician and that dudes (41:31 - 41:36)
sp ben spoons and like that's kind of it (41:32 - 41:38)
and then i didn't really think anything (41:36 - 41:40)
of it besides like oh (41:38 - 41:42)
they might not make cadabra cards (41:40 - 41:44)
anymore so like i didn't know (41:42 - 41:47)
as a kid i didn't know how big yuri (41:44 - 41:48)
geller was (41:47 - 41:49)
and obviously as a kid i didn't (41:48 - 41:53)
understand lawsuits or anything (41:49 - 41:53)
i mean yuri geller was popular in (41:53 - 42:00)
the 70s right like he was a big (41:57 - 42:02)
illusionist magician (42:00 - 42:05)
way back in the day um and then he (42:02 - 42:08)
claimed he had psychic powers which (42:05 - 42:08)
whatever (42:08 - 42:11)
and that's what started the fight (42:08 - 42:12)
between him and james randy (42:11 - 42:15)
that has dogged them forever he was (42:12 - 42:16)
you're and (42:15 - 42:19)
in 2002 he was already like washed up (42:16 - 42:19)
yeah (42:19 - 42:22)
yeah he hadn't had i don't think he had (42:19 - 42:23)
had an (42:22 - 42:26)
uh a television special a (42:23 - 42:29)
book uh a tour (42:26 - 42:32)
i don't think at any of those since the (42:29 - 42:33)
late 80s (42:32 - 42:36)
at best because he had started a bunch (42:33 - 42:37)
of lawsuits in the 90s that (42:36 - 42:40)
once again went nowhere and then he sued (42:37 - 42:41)
again in 98 (42:40 - 42:43)
for the same reason that he sued the (42:41 - 42:45)
pokemon company saying (42:43 - 42:46)
that what they were showing and (42:45 - 42:49)
debunking psychic feats was (42:46 - 42:51)
unfair to him and other magicians (42:49 - 42:53)
because they're real psychics (42:51 - 42:57)
he sued ikea uh because (42:53 - 43:00)
in 1999 he sued ikea for having (42:57 - 43:03)
bent legs that was called the yuri line (43:00 - 43:06)
so he took them on because bending is (43:03 - 43:07)
his thing (43:06 - 43:11)
he is the so desperate for (43:07 - 43:15)
fame that he sues everybody (43:11 - 43:17)
and he keeps thinking he's gonna win and (43:15 - 43:18)
he doesn't he's just (43:17 - 43:22)
irrelevant um but you know (43:18 - 43:24)
nintendo's like fine if this is how (43:22 - 43:26)
you're gonna be we're just going to skip (43:24 - 43:27)
it (43:26 - 43:30)
and i think as he's getting older (43:27 - 43:34)
realizing look i might as well become (43:30 - 43:36)
i might as well become a good guy to a (43:34 - 43:38)
bunch of people at their 25th (43:36 - 43:40)
anniversary (43:38 - 43:42)
i mean he's 73 yeah so yeah i looked up (43:40 - 43:43)
how old he was (43:42 - 43:46)
i mean it is it is the timing is perfect (43:43 - 43:48)
and i i (43:46 - 43:51)
saw that the author of the josh (43:48 - 43:51)
collusion (43:51 - 43:54)
um i saw that the author said that he (43:51 - 43:55)
wrote (43:54 - 43:57)
the cadabra article why cadabra hasn't (43:55 - 43:59)
been in tcg for 20 years (43:57 - 44:01)
he wrote that he said like a couple (43:59 - 44:03)
months ago but he just (44:01 - 44:05)
it was it wasn't like completely done (44:03 - 44:07)
and he just decided to publish it this (44:05 - 44:08)
week which (44:07 - 44:10)
or this past week which makes sense (44:08 - 44:12)
because you know pokemon is (44:10 - 44:14)
now on everyone's mind because they said (44:12 - 44:15)
it at the macy's day parade um (44:14 - 44:18)
so the timing was really great and then (44:15 - 44:20)
i'm sure yuri geller saw it (44:18 - 44:23)
saw the article specifically about him (44:20 - 44:24)
yep (44:23 - 44:26)
saw that pokemon no that dude has a (44:24 - 44:27)
google alert (44:26 - 44:30)
oh heck yeah you know he's got a googler (44:27 - 44:30)
is (44:30 - 44:32)
anybody in the world talking about me (44:30 - 44:34)
please please please (44:32 - 44:37)
um saw that you know this is the 25th (44:34 - 44:39)
anniversary next year and then he (44:37 - 44:40)
decided to make a statement i mean it (44:39 - 44:41)
all (44:40 - 44:44)
it all lines up but yeah the author the (44:41 - 44:46)
author was like oh yeah this was just (44:44 - 44:47)
something i was working on and off on i (44:46 - 44:49)
just decided to publish it this week i (44:47 - 44:50)
don't blame them for publishing it this (44:49 - 44:52)
past week because yeah pokemons (44:50 - 44:54)
yeah the news this week so good time to (44:52 - 44:56)
publish your because they're not a (44:54 - 44:57)
specific pokemon website you know they (44:56 - 44:59)
just publish game news (44:57 - 45:02)
i'd like (44:59 - 45:02)
to i don't like maybe (45:02 - 45:08)
it's it's hard to be excited about it (45:06 - 45:09)
because (45:08 - 45:11)
like i'm sure they already have the next (45:09 - 45:13)
like one year of sets planned out for (45:11 - 45:14)
the tcg (45:13 - 45:16)
in japan at least because they release (45:14 - 45:17)
sets once a month uh (45:16 - 45:18)
i'm sure they know what they're (45:17 - 45:22)
releasing you know september of 2021 (45:18 - 45:25)
in japan because they just continue to (45:22 - 45:27)
produce cards left and right so i think (45:25 - 45:30)
it would be maybe slightly more exciting (45:27 - 45:33)
once like a cadaver card does show up (45:30 - 45:35)
but at the end of the day it's like (45:33 - 45:37)
it's it's so irrelevant in like the (45:35 - 45:39)
grand scheme of things (45:37 - 45:43)
yeah 100 yep like so many people even (45:39 - 45:44)
know there (45:43 - 45:47)
wasn't cadaver cards so like like i (45:44 - 45:50)
like i'm sure there are there there are (45:47 - 45:51)
plenty of haunter cards there are plenty (45:50 - 45:52)
of macho cards (45:51 - 45:54)
uh name your middle evolution they got (45:52 - 45:57)
them name how much they're actually used (45:54 - 46:00)
not it's just a filler card right it's a (45:57 - 46:00)
skip over (46:00 - 46:04)
uh even even with middle evolutions that (46:00 - 46:05)
existed (46:04 - 46:08)
most decks just ran rare candies um to (46:05 - 46:09)
get around it like the only middle (46:08 - 46:11)
evolution that was like pretty dominant (46:09 - 46:13)
was probably like fro (46:11 - 46:16)
or frogadier uh and that's only because (46:13 - 46:18)
froggeteer had like a really good (46:16 - 46:19)
frogadier could help you find other (46:18 - 46:21)
froggy deer so it's like actually really (46:19 - 46:22)
good but (46:21 - 46:23)
most of the time you would just rare (46:22 - 46:25)
candy around it in the tcg (46:23 - 46:27)
i don't remember the last time cadabra (46:25 - 46:29)
showed up in the (46:27 - 46:32)
anime because his the the ruling was (46:29 - 46:34)
just for tcg stuff (46:32 - 46:36)
which again makes sense at the time (46:34 - 46:38)
because (46:36 - 46:40)
tcg was like the biggest thing back then (46:38 - 46:42)
but i don't remember the last (46:40 - 46:45)
anime appearance also it's easier (46:42 - 46:46)
because (46:45 - 46:49)
the uh because tcg cards are like a (46:46 - 46:53)
print production then you know copyright (46:49 - 46:56)
and that kind of legal stuff is easier (46:53 - 46:57)
to apply (46:56 - 47:00)
than to say a video game production or (46:57 - 47:00)
an (47:00 - 47:03)
animated production right it's print is (47:00 - 47:04)
very clear (47:03 - 47:07)
because you can say you know authorship (47:04 - 47:08)
and everything like that (47:07 - 47:12)
okay it looks like uh the last time (47:08 - 47:16)
abra or sorry cadabra appeared was (47:12 - 47:20)
the 146 episode of (47:16 - 47:24)
ruby and sapphire which is the 420th (47:20 - 47:27)
episode of the pokemon anime nice it was (47:24 - 47:30)
broadcasted in japan on 2005 (47:27 - 47:35)
and in the united states um in 2006 (47:30 - 47:39)
and that was the card ban (47:35 - 47:43)
was 2000 won 2002 (47:39 - 47:46)
yeah for 2001. so yeah kadab kadabra (47:43 - 47:48)
hasn't appeared in the anime for 14 (47:46 - 47:49)
years (47:48 - 47:54)
i mean a lot of things yeah (47:49 - 47:54)
and as they proceed through the (47:55 - 47:59)
generations they don't necessarily bring (47:57 - 47:59)
back (47:59 - 48:02)
ones from older generations yeah i mean (47:59 - 48:04)
i i would expect at some point we may (48:02 - 48:06)
now see it in journeys (48:04 - 48:09)
i mean also the last time jinx appeared (48:06 - 48:11)
in the anime was also (48:09 - 48:15)
2006. they've been cleaning house (48:11 - 48:17)
yeah i think his like apology might have (48:15 - 48:18)
been like slightly better (48:17 - 48:21)
if he didn't say my cadaver and he (48:18 - 48:22)
didn't (48:21 - 48:25)
then plug his website at the end of the (48:22 - 48:26)
post (48:25 - 48:29)
no i mean it's he's just just trying to (48:26 - 48:30)
like (48:29 - 48:33)
latch on to this star to like bring some (48:30 - 48:34)
relevance to (48:33 - 48:36)
dying fame yeah i just love his pin (48:34 - 48:38)
tweet (48:36 - 48:43)
do you believe the cia does no (48:38 - 48:46)
it doesn't but sure (48:43 - 48:50)
well there's his uh probably like the (48:46 - 48:51)
the next time i think people will talk (48:50 - 48:53)
about yuri geller is probably when he (48:51 - 48:54)
like (48:53 - 48:57)
passes away he dies and nobody thinks (48:54 - 48:58)
that he died and then people will be (48:57 - 49:00)
like you remember when he got into a (48:58 - 49:04)
tiff with nintendo (49:00 - 49:04)
what was that dude who fought who fought (49:04 - 49:08)
over that cadaver thing (49:06 - 49:12)
he died speaking of tcg stuff (49:08 - 49:15)
uh there's another tcg box the sword and (49:12 - 49:16)
shield (49:15 - 49:19)
elite trainer box plus (49:16 - 49:22)
featuring zashian or zamazenta (49:19 - 49:23)
as the name suggests there are two (49:22 - 49:25)
different versions of the set one (49:23 - 49:27)
focusing on galler's region legendary (49:25 - 49:29)
warrior pokemon (49:27 - 49:32)
which set you choose either zashi and v (49:29 - 49:33)
or zamazeta v (49:32 - 49:36)
will also feature 65 card sleeves elite (49:33 - 49:37)
trainer boxes (49:36 - 49:40)
will contain a variety of shiny metal (49:37 - 49:43)
accessories you will get a metal coin (49:40 - 49:45)
featuring zashi and zamazenta (49:43 - 49:48)
six metal damage counter dice and a set (49:45 - 49:50)
of metal condition markers these are (49:48 - 49:51)
normally plastic by the way (49:50 - 49:53)
not only that but it will include a (49:51 - 49:56)
player's guide a real book and a (49:53 - 50:00)
whopping 12 booster packs from the sword (49:56 - 50:00)
and shield (50:00 - 50:03)
series it doesn't specifically say what (50:00 - 50:05)
booster packs (50:03 - 50:07)
but that would probably include i'm (50:05 - 50:08)
assuming (50:07 - 50:10)
sword and shield rebel clash darkness (50:08 - 50:12)
ablaze (50:10 - 50:15)
vivid voltage i think those are the four (50:12 - 50:18)
i don't think i'm missing one usually an (50:15 - 50:19)
elite trainer box is eight (50:18 - 50:21)
uh if it's a special one like champions (50:19 - 50:23)
path it's ten (50:21 - 50:26)
uh but this is twelve yeah uh apparently (50:23 - 50:29)
they came out on november 20th i have (50:26 - 50:33)
not seen these in stores at all but also (50:29 - 50:36)
i can't find any pokemon stuff in stores (50:33 - 50:36)
because (50:36 - 50:39)
it's all still sold out everywhere can (50:36 - 50:41)
we talk about (50:39 - 50:43)
how pokemon.com needs to do better in (50:41 - 50:44)
these articles (50:43 - 50:45)
uh what's about what's wrong with this (50:44 - 50:47)
article besides as (50:45 - 50:49)
as a nod to the strength of these (50:47 - 50:50)
legendary metal type (50:49 - 50:55)
pokemon metal is yeah they're not in (50:50 - 50:55)
metal is it's not also what is the elect (50:56 - 51:01)
electric is not called electronics (50:59 - 51:04)
it's called lightning yeah why (51:01 - 51:06)
why are they switching names around it's (51:04 - 51:09)
always been metal in the (51:06 - 51:13)
but you haven't why (51:09 - 51:16)
well metal gallery pressed (51:13 - 51:19)
charges for using his spoons (51:16 - 51:23)
the steel industry like we're gonna (51:19 - 51:26)
we're gonna sue steel industry very (51:23 - 51:26)
upset (51:26 - 51:28)
uh yeah i don't know it's always been (51:26 - 51:30)
metal i even think (51:28 - 51:33)
they don't i i may be wrong but i think (51:30 - 51:34)
it's like they (51:33 - 51:36)
it's not dark energy but it's darkness (51:34 - 51:39)
and darkness yep it's darkness yeah (51:36 - 51:42)
darkness why uh (51:39 - 51:43)
is it because it's more universal (51:42 - 51:46)
probably right like i don't know (51:43 - 51:48)
is is like fire type in german called (51:46 - 51:50)
fire type or is it called like (51:48 - 51:53)
dang i don't know a good german word for (51:50 - 51:54)
a pun (51:53 - 51:58)
you don't know german at all uh guten (51:54 - 51:59)
tag (51:58 - 52:01)
schnitzel type yeah the tcg stuff is (51:59 - 52:03)
still uh still out of control people (52:01 - 52:05)
still cannot find vivid voltage the (52:03 - 52:07)
newest set i believe there is a reprint (52:05 - 52:07)
of (52:07 - 52:11)
vivid voltage coming out in that january (52:07 - 52:13)
like it makes why do some of the match (52:11 - 52:14)
and other ones don't (52:13 - 52:16)
like the only ones that don't match (52:14 - 52:18)
lightning darkness and metal (52:16 - 52:21)
it's wow well yeah it's just the way it (52:18 - 52:23)
is (52:21 - 52:23)
yeah the way it is look they they tried (52:23 - 52:27)
to bring in ferry it didn't work (52:25 - 52:30)
if they would have named it like if they (52:27 - 52:32)
dump fairy they can fix the names (52:30 - 52:34)
but the ccg doesn't have every type (52:32 - 52:37)
though which is also a problem (52:34 - 52:41)
no it would make the game worse (52:37 - 52:41)
i mean they have a lot of types they (52:41 - 52:45)
have retro energy (52:43 - 52:47)
they have heal energy they do that yeah (52:45 - 52:48)
they do have the (52:47 - 52:52)
special energies prism energy (52:48 - 52:55)

all right final bit of news here is off (54:10 - 54:13)
pokemon.com (54:12 - 54:16)
recruit gallerian slowpoke in (54:13 - 54:20)
pokemon cafe mix team event (54:16 - 54:23)
i wonder whatever happened to that uh pk (54:20 - 54:26)
mencast group (54:23 - 54:26)
well since you refused to play (54:26 - 54:30)
horizontal games (54:28 - 54:32)
because of your weak wrists and the way (54:30 - 54:33)
you hold your phone weird (54:32 - 54:36)
you'll never know i was going to join (54:33 - 54:38)
the pkmag cast group but that was (54:36 - 54:39)
spelled wrong and then the person who (54:38 - 54:41)
spelled it wrong apologized and then (54:39 - 54:43)
left the group and then it put somebody (54:41 - 54:44)
else in charge of the group and we don't (54:43 - 54:52)
know who that person is (54:44 - 54:55)
down the rabbit hole we go we can't make (54:52 - 54:55)
a new group (54:55 - 54:57)
because it shares the name with the (54:55 - 54:59)
other group which is spelled technically (54:57 - 55:00)
wrong (54:59 - 55:03)
anyways a new team event has begun in (55:00 - 55:04)
cafe mix (55:03 - 55:07)
you can work with your squad to convince (55:04 - 55:07)

people probably like it i enjoyed it (55:46 - 55:50)
while i played it oh were we gonna talk (55:48 - 55:52)
about the masters tickets thing (55:50 - 55:53)
oh yeah yeah that was our final bit of (55:52 - 55:55)
news okay (55:53 - 55:59)
i was uh just gonna say they have (55:55 - 56:03)
given more fan service to cafe mix (55:59 - 56:05)
this year than the like four years (56:03 - 56:06)
pokemon duel (56:05 - 56:09)
existed this is very true (56:06 - 56:13)
very true or poor poor (56:09 - 56:16)
duel oh we should talk about the tcg (56:13 - 56:17)
drama (56:16 - 56:19)
in the ptc geo we'll save that till next (56:17 - 56:20)
week okay (56:19 - 56:22)
because that'll unfortunately i didn't (56:20 - 56:24)
plan the yuri geller stuff to happen and (56:22 - 56:24)
that was (56:24 - 56:26)
25 minutes of our life for never getting (56:24 - 56:28)
back (56:26 - 56:28)
25 minutes that yuri's excited about it (56:29 - 56:33)
last bit of news before we move on (56:31 - 56:37)
uh is just a minor pokemon go news (56:33 - 56:40)
uh they are adding their first gen eight (56:37 - 56:43)
trainer which is gloria not go (56:40 - 56:46)
masters oh sorry did i say go with my (56:43 - 56:47)
bad yeah (56:46 - 56:49)
like what full disclosure i am partnered (56:47 - 56:50)
with dna (56:49 - 56:52)
um some people didn't know the (56:50 - 56:54)
protagonist's names (56:52 - 56:56)
uh gloria and victor it's supposed to be (56:54 - 56:57)
like (56:56 - 57:00)
glory and victory oh nice (56:57 - 57:02)
that's what it's like sword shield glory (57:00 - 57:06)
victory anyways uh gloria is being added (57:02 - 57:09)
um she will appear between november 29th (57:06 - 57:13)
10 p.m to december 20th 10 p.m (57:09 - 57:16)
um she will be with zashian which i (57:13 - 57:17)
think is (57:16 - 57:18)
some people are saying it's backwards (57:17 - 57:20)
because normally it's like (57:18 - 57:22)
the boys the first game and the girls (57:20 - 57:23)
the second game (57:22 - 57:27)
so it's elio and celine (57:23 - 57:30)
for like sun and moon elio yeah but in (57:27 - 57:31)
this case i think people were (57:30 - 57:34)
referencing she got zashian because (57:31 - 57:37)
zashian's the girl even though also this (57:34 - 57:39)
blue people's minds (57:37 - 57:42)
uh so zashian and zamazenta are (57:39 - 57:44)
genderless pokemon but if you (57:42 - 57:47)
read zamasunta's pokedex entry it (57:44 - 57:51)
says specifically that zashian (57:47 - 57:55)
is his or his older sister (57:51 - 57:57)
zashian is older than zamasunta and the (57:55 - 58:00)
pokedex refers to it as a sister (57:57 - 58:02)
um this isn't the first time they've (58:00 - 58:04)
done that because manafee (58:02 - 58:06)
is also a genderless pokemon but the (58:04 - 58:08)
pokedex entry refers to manaphy as (58:06 - 58:12)
the prince of the sea i don't know why (58:08 - 58:16)
not here to argue about pokemon genders (58:12 - 58:16)
don't talk about the voice controversy (58:16 - 58:19)
that she's not scottish (58:18 - 58:23)
would she be scottish people (58:19 - 58:26)
people because she wears somewhat (58:23 - 58:30)
stereotypically or traditional scottish (58:26 - 58:32)
outfit with the hat and everything so (58:30 - 58:34)
people were assuming that her voice (58:32 - 58:37)
would be scottish but (58:34 - 58:40)
definitely over in the the britain (58:37 - 58:43)
side with their voice actor so there was (58:40 - 58:44)
a bit of a (58:43 - 58:46)
there's a bit of a thing people like she (58:44 - 58:49)
has a voice and it's british (58:46 - 58:51)
i don't know anything about scottish or (58:49 - 58:54)
british clothes to make that assumption (58:51 - 58:57)
yeah i agree it's the hat and the (58:54 - 58:57)
sweater (58:57 - 59:02)
uh they also are they also gave a bonus (58:57 - 59:04)
which i think as long as you log in five (59:02 - 59:07)
days between now and december 20th (59:04 - 59:09)
you will get these tickets you will get (59:07 - 59:12)
a hundred and twenty scout tickets (59:09 - 59:14)
how much does it cost greg to pull from (59:12 - 59:15)
that 25 (59:14 - 59:17)
30 30. oh it does it does cost exactly (59:15 - 59:20)
30. yeah it costs exactly 30. so you get (59:17 - 59:23)
four free five-star polls which i would (59:20 - 59:26)
argue is pretty generous you don't get (59:23 - 59:26)
generous (59:26 - 59:28)
you don't get to pick the polls you (59:26 - 59:30)
don't get to pick they are they are (59:28 - 59:31)
random (59:30 - 59:33)
welcome to gotcha but they are all five (59:31 - 59:35)
stars and (59:33 - 59:38)
it's not clear if (59:35 - 59:41)
new upcoming five stars aka gloria will (59:38 - 59:41)
be (59:41 - 59:45)
added into that pool oh (59:41 - 59:46)
that's what i was saving my tickets for (59:45 - 59:48)
because what if they add new sink pairs (59:46 - 59:49)
to it (59:48 - 59:51)
um but i'm sure people have already (59:49 - 59:54)
spent them i've already spent them (59:51 - 60:01)
what the what why didn't you save them (59:54 - 60:03)
i have a bunch of five stars i need to (60:01 - 60:05)
get the chances of me getting gloria (60:03 - 60:09)
are just as bad like (60:05 - 60:12)
i didn't what are the appearance rates i (60:09 - 60:13)
think it's like three percent for each (60:12 - 60:14)
one in that (60:13 - 60:17)
bundle um there are (60:14 - 60:22)
also offering rate everything's at 3.448 (60:17 - 60:27)
so that's pretty good better than a (60:22 - 60:30)
shiny (60:27 - 60:30)
i mean i'm probably like having done my (60:33 - 60:37)
initial polls and being like (60:36 - 60:40)
oh well these ain't great (60:37 - 60:44)
i am going to just see if (60:40 - 60:48)
glory is added in they changed the app (60:44 - 60:49)
icon (60:48 - 60:52)
they had a retweet goal where if you (60:49 - 60:53)
retweet (60:52 - 60:56)
if they got 10 000 retweets was it ten (60:53 - 60:56)
thousand (60:56 - 60:58)
something like that they would give (60:56 - 61:01)
everyone a bonus three thousand gems (60:58 - 61:02)
uh which they hit i think they hit it (61:01 - 61:05)
within less than 48 hours (61:02 - 61:08)
um they are also giving everyone 10 000 (61:05 - 61:09)
gems by logging in every day (61:08 - 61:11)
for the rest of the year so that starts (61:09 - 61:13)
i believe probably by the time this (61:11 - 61:15)
podcast comes up (61:13 - 61:18)
so if you haven't played masters or you (61:15 - 61:20)
are on and off in masters (61:18 - 61:22)
or maybe you just like opening apps and (61:20 - 61:24)
collecting the daily items and then (61:22 - 61:25)
closing the apps (61:24 - 61:27)
uh this would probably be the best time (61:25 - 61:29)
to start because (61:27 - 61:31)
um you're gonna be getting 3000 gems i (61:29 - 61:34)
think the 3000 gems goes out on (61:31 - 61:36)
actually the 3000 gems should be going (61:34 - 61:38)
out by the time you hear this podcast (61:36 - 61:40)
and then you can get another 10 000 gems (61:38 - 61:42)
and then you can get the (61:40 - 61:45)
four free five star sync pairs (61:42 - 61:47)
and they are doing a bunch of bonus (61:45 - 61:48)
items but we don't need to waste (61:47 - 61:49)
anyone's time of like all the other (61:48 - 61:50)
bonus items you'll just collect them (61:49 - 61:51)
they'll go into your inventory you'll (61:50 - 61:54)
eventually use them (61:51 - 61:54)
it'll be clear why you have them you'll (61:54 - 61:59)
be like what are these 18 different (61:57 - 62:01)
sodas doing (61:59 - 62:03)
they did announce that two new holiday (62:01 - 62:05)
sink pairs are coming they showed (62:03 - 62:09)
the trainers one is skyla one is erica (62:05 - 62:12)
they have not revealed those pokemon yet (62:09 - 62:13)
for those (62:12 - 62:17)
people and then they're bringing back (62:13 - 62:18)
sigma suit (62:17 - 62:22)
red blue and leaf which is (62:18 - 62:25)
i s you could either argue they're (62:22 - 62:26)
bringing them back because (62:25 - 62:29)
it increases revenue or they're bringing (62:26 - 62:29)
them back (62:29 - 62:31)
because it's nice oh you know what i was (62:29 - 62:32)
going to ask you greg (62:31 - 62:35)
yeah uh because i don't play any other (62:32 - 62:37)
gotcha games (62:35 - 62:39)
the talking the word on the street is (62:37 - 62:40)
that (62:39 - 62:42)
pokemon masters has a lot of banners and (62:40 - 62:45)
they keep rotating banners very quickly (62:42 - 62:47)
i haven't played any other masters games (62:45 - 62:48)
but my thought process is (62:47 - 62:51)
why wouldn't you have multiple banners (62:48 - 62:52)
because not (62:51 - 62:54)
everyone has every character and not (62:52 - 62:55)
everyone wants to pull on a different (62:54 - 62:57)
character and if the only banners you (62:55 - 62:57)
have (62:57 - 63:00)
is like vulchner and cynthia and if i'm (62:57 - 63:02)
a player and i don't care about vulcanur (63:00 - 63:03)
and i already have cynthia then i have (63:02 - 63:05)
no reason to pull (63:03 - 63:07)
but people are saying that this is a (63:05 - 63:08)
complaint that there's too many banners (63:07 - 63:09)
but (63:08 - 63:11)
isn't is that how other games do it is (63:09 - 63:13)
is it actually too many banners (63:11 - 63:17)
or generally banners are tied to (63:13 - 63:20)
whatever event is going on in the game (63:17 - 63:21)
so usually they'll put up a banner to (63:20 - 63:23)
say hey we've increased these or we're (63:21 - 63:25)
adding in this new character (63:23 - 63:28)
and then in a lot of gotcha cases that (63:25 - 63:30)
new character just goes back into the (63:28 - 63:33)
pool so the banner usually is here's the (63:30 - 63:34)
heightened (63:33 - 63:38)
of this and then they go into the (63:34 - 63:39)
general pool (63:38 - 63:44)
um only only rarely do they have like (63:39 - 63:47)
hey you know like uh brave (63:44 - 63:50)
exodus final fantasy has specialty (63:47 - 63:52)
banners especially characters that only (63:50 - 63:53)
come around once in a while (63:52 - 63:55)
they're they're the ones that also sort (63:53 - 63:56)
of do this because they are tied to the (63:55 - 63:58)
very specific characters (63:56 - 64:01)
but those banners don't come up a lot (63:58 - 64:04)
why it's a complaint is there's a lot of (64:01 - 64:06)
banners which means (64:04 - 64:09)
you have that weird tension of (64:06 - 64:11)
i don't have anything to look forward to (64:09 - 64:13)
and i have so many (64:11 - 64:17)
things to that are highlighted (64:13 - 64:20)
that i have to split my focus so it is a (64:17 - 64:22)
sort of weird like oh there's seven (64:20 - 64:24)
things for me to pull on (64:22 - 64:27)
which do i go to also what are you gonna (64:24 - 64:27)
add (64:27 - 64:29)
because they have the thing of once that (64:27 - 64:30)
banner goes away (64:29 - 64:32)
those characters go away so it's like (64:30 - 64:34)
you saying to me why aren't you saving (64:32 - 64:35)
your (64:34 - 64:37)
five star tickets for gloria that's part (64:35 - 64:38)
of the problem (64:37 - 64:41)
is because they very much do the once (64:38 - 64:43)
the spanner's gone that character (64:41 - 64:46)
isn't in the pool um and that's (64:43 - 64:48)
where a lot of the complaint comes from (64:46 - 64:50)
because it's really sort of frustrating (64:48 - 64:51)
to be like well i really need this (64:50 - 64:52)
character (64:51 - 64:54)
so i'm going to save it for that banner (64:52 - 64:56)
to come around maybe (64:54 - 64:58)
or there's seven other banners that they (64:56 - 64:59)
have right now with really weird (64:58 - 65:00)
mixtures (64:59 - 65:02)
the banners tend not to make a lot of (65:00 - 65:04)
sense (65:02 - 65:05)
they don't they're not great at tying (65:04 - 65:08)
them to things that are going on (65:05 - 65:10)
so it just sort of comes across as a (65:08 - 65:12)
confused mess (65:10 - 65:16)
is it is it a huge problem no uh it (65:12 - 65:17)
would be nice that once they released a (65:16 - 65:18)
banner (65:17 - 65:20)
they put that character all the (65:18 - 65:22)
characters into the pool (65:20 - 65:25)
and didn't do this thing where they only (65:22 - 65:26)
come around (65:25 - 65:28)
whenever they decide like i think people (65:26 - 65:31)
are used to those things being (65:28 - 65:34)
holiday related and not (65:31 - 65:37)
this is just a character that exists and (65:34 - 65:38)
you released it for no good reason and (65:37 - 65:40)
then you took it away for no good reason (65:38 - 65:43)
like banners that get removed generally (65:40 - 65:45)
in other games are tied to (65:43 - 65:49)
specific holiday events and (65:45 - 65:53)
like regalia they recycle holiday events (65:49 - 65:55)
so in the middle of summer they're like (65:53 - 65:57)
we're bringing back halloween events and (65:55 - 65:58)
we're gonna bring back the halloween (65:57 - 66:02)
banner for a little bit um masters (65:58 - 66:03)
doesn't do that (66:02 - 66:05)
only other thing with the masters is (66:03 - 66:06)
they uh (66:05 - 66:10)
they put out an interesting tweet here (66:06 - 66:12)

and we have red from kanto (66:30 - 66:36)
ethan from johto (66:33 - 66:40)
stevenstone from hohen then it goes to (66:36 - 66:41)
gloria (66:40 - 66:45)
from galler (66:41 - 66:49)
and then it goes into cynthia (66:45 - 66:53)
from sinnoh uh what's her name (66:49 - 66:55)
oh i'm blanking on her name right now (66:53 - 66:57)
serena from (66:55 - 67:01)
uh kalos and then how from alola (66:57 - 67:05)
and there is uh no gen (67:01 - 67:08)
5 trainer here (67:05 - 67:09)
but there are eight different (67:08 - 67:11)
backgrounds (67:09 - 67:15)
and there's a hole and in that hole (67:11 - 67:18)
it is very i would say (67:15 - 67:20)
i would use the word people are (67:18 - 67:22)
speculating that that is uh (67:20 - 67:24)
the throne from unova but i think it's (67:22 - 67:25)
very obvious (67:24 - 67:28)
it is the throne from unova does that (67:25 - 67:29)
mean it's going to be n (67:28 - 67:32)
yeah that's that's the speculation is (67:29 - 67:32)
that (67:32 - 67:34)
they said a special character will be (67:32 - 67:36)
coming later this month (67:34 - 67:39)
and uh like all (67:36 - 67:41)
possible characters coming people (67:39 - 67:43)
guessed diantha (67:41 - 67:47)
and it never is her um but because (67:43 - 67:50)
they purposely left out a gen 5 trainer (67:47 - 67:53)
in this in this image and they're (67:50 - 67:54)
showing ends thrown (67:53 - 67:56)
i guess you could maybe say it could be (67:54 - 67:57)
getzus (67:56 - 68:00)
uh um but i think it's just never on the (67:57 - 68:01)
throne (68:00 - 68:05)
yeah um true yes the end was crowned (68:01 - 68:07)
was always like the in the background (68:05 - 68:08)
manipulation yeah he's (68:07 - 68:12)
he's the vizier (68:08 - 68:14)
off to the side pulling the strings plus (68:12 - 68:16)
if you look up (68:14 - 68:18)
thrown from inova it's literally a (68:16 - 68:19)
picture of ed sitting on that exact (68:18 - 68:20)
throne (68:19 - 68:23)
with that exact background so uh yeah i (68:20 - 68:24)
think that's exciting i think n (68:23 - 68:26)
is the most popular character from black (68:24 - 68:28)
and white (68:26 - 68:31)
what is n gonna get uh (68:28 - 68:34)
i think skyla is more popular well (68:31 - 68:36)
all right i mean skyla is way popular (68:34 - 68:38)
which legendary are they given in (68:36 - 68:42)
restaurant definitely resharam yes end (68:38 - 68:42)
was like (68:42 - 68:45)
never seen with zekrom i think there's (68:42 - 68:45)
like (68:45 - 68:48)
i think maybe in the manga he has both (68:45 - 68:50)
but yeah well depending on whether you (68:48 - 68:51)
play (68:50 - 68:53)
black or white he's got one or the other (68:51 - 68:55)
that's true (68:53 - 68:58)
he's always shown with restaurant (68:55 - 69:00)
if they if they we know that masters (68:58 - 69:02)
does not care and they do whatever they (69:00 - 69:02)
want (69:02 - 69:05)
that's not true he's probably gonna show (69:02 - 69:05)
up with (69:05 - 69:09)
uh volcarona i mean gloria has (69:05 - 69:11)
a legendary pokemon thus breaking the (69:09 - 69:13)
starters pattern so (69:11 - 69:16)
all bets are off that's true but it (69:13 - 69:17)
still makes sense because you know the (69:16 - 69:18)
protagonist doesn't (69:17 - 69:21)
show up with an esper the oh interesting (69:18 - 69:24)
i like the theory um i guess if they (69:21 - 69:25)
don't give him a legendary they give him (69:24 - 69:26)
zoroark (69:25 - 69:31)
right ah that's a good call (69:26 - 69:32)
i don't know what zoroark is gonna do in (69:31 - 69:35)
pokemon masters but sure (69:32 - 69:38)
yeah they're gonna even have purloin hmm (69:35 - 69:39)
i like the pearline what if they just (69:38 - 69:41)
give them lilly puff (69:39 - 69:45)
oh i got a shiny lily pup today and go (69:41 - 69:48)
oh no all right greg give us our (69:45 - 69:49)
question of the week (69:48 - 69:53)
i want to hear the question of the week (69:49 - 69:56)
only the question of the week will do (69:53 - 69:56)
don't know any of these songs it's after (69:57 - 70:01)
it's after thanksgiving (70:00 - 70:03)
get ready people we all know what (70:01 - 70:05)
happens to me after thanksgiving (70:03 - 70:09)
valentine's day no i am allowed (70:05 - 70:11)
to break into the collection that has (70:09 - 70:12)
forbidden (70:11 - 70:16)
all other times of the year so you're (70:12 - 70:16)
going to be like (70:16 - 70:18)
the weather outside is frightful but the (70:16 - 70:20)
questions are so delightful (70:18 - 70:23)
you got it since we've got no place to (70:20 - 70:24)
go (70:23 - 70:27)
ask away ask away okay shout out to uh (70:24 - 70:29)
lewis for sending in the yuri geller (70:27 - 70:30)
stuff i (70:29 - 70:33)
we had a ton of people send that in but (70:30 - 70:36)
hey attic channel gets their shoutouts (70:33 - 70:37)
uh this is from patrick (70:36 - 70:40)
to piggyback on a thanksgiving theme (70:37 - 70:40)
what (70:40 - 70:43)
bird pokemon would best symbolize for (70:40 - 70:44)
thanksgiving (70:43 - 70:46)
since we don't have a turkey pokemon as (70:44 - 70:47)
of now (70:46 - 70:51)
how delicious do you think ho-oh is mmm (70:47 - 70:55)
true i feel like that's very ashy (70:51 - 70:58)
but it would cook itself exactly (70:55 - 71:01)
to just the right like just the right (70:58 - 71:03)
amount (71:01 - 71:05)
why do people think ho oh is a turkey (71:03 - 71:06)
did they never see (71:05 - 71:09)
harry potter i don't think phoenixes (71:06 - 71:09)
have (71:09 - 71:12)
those big peacock type tales that (71:09 - 71:14)
peacocks and turkeys have (71:12 - 71:17)
yeah turkeys have sea cocktails yeah (71:14 - 71:18)
they have the yeah that spreads out (71:17 - 71:21)
yeah come to my neighborhood i will show (71:18 - 71:26)
you a bunch of angry turkeys (71:21 - 71:29)
and i went past like 20 turkeys and i (71:26 - 71:30)
was like get me (71:29 - 71:32)
out of here before they attack they are (71:30 - 71:33)
mean (71:32 - 71:36)
they are mean and territorial i don't (71:33 - 71:38)
know why minneapolis is overrun (71:36 - 71:43)
we have wild turkeys wild turkeys (71:38 - 71:45)
i don't know like i don't i don't think (71:43 - 71:46)
the pokemon birds are like good (71:45 - 71:49)
eating birds i mean blaziken yeah (71:46 - 71:50)
another one that cooks itself (71:49 - 71:53)
yeah combustion is a chicken though so (71:50 - 71:54)
wouldn't yeah (71:53 - 71:56)
what about farfetch you can have duck on (71:54 - 71:57)
thanksgiving oh (71:56 - 72:00)
yeah duck is reserved for (71:57 - 72:03)
christmas hmm i mean i'll eat duck any (72:00 - 72:04)
day (72:03 - 72:06)
i really like duck all the time this was (72:04 - 72:08)
my logic because (72:06 - 72:12)
oh boy because ho-oh is obviously a (72:08 - 72:13)
phoenix (72:12 - 72:18)
right no but go on you mean no (72:13 - 72:20)
it is continue i don't think there's any (72:18 - 72:23)
debate that it's not obviously a phoenix (72:20 - 72:26)
have you played the tcg greg it's (72:23 - 72:26)
ability (72:26 - 72:28)
literally brings it from the discard (72:26 - 72:30)
pile back onto your bench (72:28 - 72:33)
no because the tcg is garbage and uses (72:30 - 72:35)
garbage energy as we covered earlier (72:33 - 72:38)
darkness metal (72:35 - 72:40)
yeah there is no garbage energy yeah not (72:38 - 72:42)
yet not yet (72:40 - 72:44)
there's horror energy so give it time i (72:42 - 72:47)
love horror energy (72:44 - 72:50)
ah i would say if we're picking (72:47 - 72:50)
something (72:50 - 72:54)
for thanksgiving i would pick unpheasant (72:50 - 72:58)
because yes because pheasants (72:54 - 73:01)
are one of the game birds such as (72:58 - 73:02)
turkeys i don't know (73:01 - 73:06)
any other game birds besides (73:02 - 73:06)
quail okay quail do we have a quail (73:06 - 73:10)
pokemon though (73:09 - 73:12)
no ah i don't know what i don't i don't (73:10 - 73:14)
think i know what a quail is (73:12 - 73:18)
this is a tinier bird does it fly (73:14 - 73:21)
yes the turkeys can't fly (73:18 - 73:24)
yes they can not with that attitude um (73:21 - 73:26)
i don't think they're even chickens can (73:24 - 73:27)
fly where do you think (73:26 - 73:31)
turkeys sleep at night i'd never never (73:27 - 73:32)
thought that in the (73:31 - 73:36)
30s this is the dandelion problem also (73:32 - 73:37)
thought about it either until i was (73:36 - 73:39)
walking my dogs in the morning and a (73:37 - 73:41)
flock of turkeys angry at me (73:39 - 73:43)
dive bomb me from the trees they were (73:41 - 73:44)
sleeping (73:43 - 73:48)
so here's the thing and it's it's (73:44 - 73:50)
because you guys i i don't know what the (73:48 - 73:51)
right word is (73:50 - 73:56)
but you think if something flies (73:51 - 74:00)
that it has to fly like 50 miles (73:56 - 74:04)
no a bird can fly that only flies like (74:00 - 74:08)
10 feet like a chicken will fly 10 feet (74:04 - 74:09)
and that's as far as it's gonna go a (74:08 - 74:12)
turkey will fly up to a tree branch it's (74:09 - 74:14)
not gonna fly across the country it's no (74:12 - 74:18)
goose but it can still fly (74:14 - 74:21)
yeah it still flies it absolutely flies (74:18 - 74:25)
just doesn't fly a lot uh what about (74:21 - 74:28)
galera and zapdos (74:25 - 74:31)
um that is kind of turkey looking isn't (74:28 - 74:32)
it (74:31 - 74:34)
do people eat pheasants yes yeah oh you (74:32 - 74:35)
know people eat (74:34 - 74:37)
ostriches ostrich is real good yeah but (74:35 - 74:39)
michael is real good (74:37 - 74:41)
when they when okay hold on this is a (74:39 - 74:42)
dumb question (74:41 - 74:44)
people eat pheasants probably the same (74:42 - 74:46)
way they eat turkey right like put out (74:44 - 74:46)
sandwich (74:46 - 74:50)
slice it up no no pheasants usually (74:46 - 74:51)
roasted like duck (74:50 - 74:54)
tends to be yeah they're very small it's (74:51 - 74:57)
not it's not (74:54 - 74:57)
like people eat pigeon too so so you're (74:58 - 75:02)
saying turkey is the biggest of the game (75:00 - 75:04)
birds (75:02 - 75:06)
well turkey's not a game bird yeah it (75:04 - 75:07)
doesn't have a gamey taste (75:06 - 75:09)
we've gotten rid of that i mean i (75:07 - 75:11)
thought game birds was just a term of (75:09 - 75:11)
like (75:11 - 75:15)
this is a bird we hunt now (75:11 - 75:18)
that's different there's a gamey taste (75:15 - 75:19)
to them (75:18 - 75:22)
i have now i have to look at the the (75:19 - 75:26)
exact term why how is it (75:22 - 75:31)
uh let's see game birds quail (75:26 - 75:34)
grouse partridge oh great (75:31 - 75:37)
how did we forget that bob white i don't (75:34 - 75:38)
know what a bobwhite is (75:37 - 75:42)
pheasant more grouse more quail (75:38 - 75:43)
hey you're not that friendly it's a (75:42 - 75:45)
robbery to you (75:43 - 75:47)
wild turkey is official game bird well (75:45 - 75:49)
yeah but it has to be a wild turkey it (75:47 - 75:50)
has to be a wild turkey not a domestic (75:49 - 75:51)
turkey (75:50 - 75:54)
oh i see so if you're not truly (75:51 - 75:55)
celebrating thanksgiving if you didn't (75:54 - 75:58)
hunt your own turkey (75:55 - 75:59)
they didn't have their own turkey like (75:58 - 76:01)
that either (75:59 - 76:03)
those things have been raised for as (76:01 - 76:05)
long as chickens have been raised (76:03 - 76:08)
i wonder what how they define (76:05 - 76:10)
what a game bird is i think anything (76:08 - 76:13)
that you could hunt (76:10 - 76:16)
then becomes a game bird oh game bird a (76:13 - 76:18)
bird hunted for sport (76:16 - 76:21)
or food (76:18 - 76:23)
i don't know what gamey means like when (76:21 - 76:25)
you say it has a gamey taste (76:23 - 76:27)
i don't think i've ever so you will (76:25 - 76:28)
notice (76:27 - 76:32)
that with some of the non-farmed (76:28 - 76:35)
meats that there is a just it's a (76:32 - 76:37)
distinctive (76:35 - 76:39)
flavor to it that i want to say it's an (76:37 - 76:41)
earthy flavor (76:39 - 76:43)
yeah it's just less palatable right it's (76:41 - 76:45)
less enjoyable to the human palette (76:43 - 76:48)
how do you feel about dark meat on (76:45 - 76:50)
turkey don't like dark meat (76:48 - 76:52)
so take the dark meat flavor and (76:50 - 76:54)
intensify it and that gets (76:52 - 76:58)
near the gamey flavor of a lot of the (76:54 - 76:58)
game birds (76:58 - 77:01)
oh that is like duck has a slight duck (76:58 - 77:03)
has a slight gaminess to it but like (77:01 - 77:06)
if you've ever had goose goose is a (77:03 - 77:08)
gamey bird (77:06 - 77:11)
yeah it's delicious but (77:08 - 77:14)
it has to be prepared (77:11 - 77:16)
well and oh we made a goose once in our (77:14 - 77:18)
house and (77:16 - 77:22)
never again never again (77:18 - 77:24)
uh okay so back to so ho-oh is the game (77:22 - 77:25)
bird (77:24 - 77:29)
no one why would you hunt guys what is (77:25 - 77:31)

pheasant (79:24 - 79:28)
it's not traditional it's it's it's a (79:25 - 79:29)
very (79:28 - 79:32)
it's a very old worldly uh (79:29 - 79:36)
holiday meal but you know true also (79:32 - 79:39)
420 blackbirds so you could put (79:36 - 79:42)
a bunch of hank's crow into a pie (79:39 - 79:45)
and have sure that up do you think kids (79:42 - 79:46)

week so the last pokemon of the week (80:55 - 80:59)
since you guys didn't (80:58 - 81:03)
solve it last week while i was not here (80:59 - 81:05)
uh was very short so let me just read it (81:03 - 81:07)
again i was hardcore napping and (81:05 - 81:09)
completely missed the text messages from (81:07 - 81:10)
steve and greg (81:09 - 81:12)
letting me know that recording was (81:10 - 81:13)
starting so i did not have a lot of time (81:12 - 81:14)
to prepare (81:13 - 81:17)
this week's pokemon in podcast lore this (81:14 - 81:19)
is the pokemon that greg defeated with a (81:17 - 81:20)
level 100 roselia (81:19 - 81:23)
i think it has a primal form and has (81:20 - 81:25)
been featured as the box art for (81:23 - 81:30)
two games it's (81:25 - 81:33)
stantler kroger did you say (81:30 - 81:36)

both (81:36 - 81:38)
wrong stanley ain't never been box art (81:36 - 81:39)
for nothing (81:38 - 81:42)
look we the alternate pronunciation of (81:39 - 81:43)
kyogre is kroger (81:42 - 81:45)
we all know this this has been well (81:43 - 81:47)
established on this program (81:45 - 81:50)
yes kyogre is the correct answer it is (81:47 - 81:54)
a chi and an ogre i love ogres i don't (81:50 - 81:56)
know what a kai is i have to look at (81:54 - 81:58)
that there's a swashbuckler class in (81:56 - 82:01)
dungeons and dragons i do not know that (81:58 - 82:04)
oh heck yeah swashbuckling rogues (82:01 - 82:08)
heck yeah uh kyogre's special attack and (82:04 - 82:10)
attack and special defense and defense (82:08 - 82:13)

highest base special attack stat base (82:24 - 82:30)
special defense stat and base stat total (82:26 - 82:34)
of all water type pokemon (82:30 - 82:34)
in pokemon battle revolution mar (82:35 - 82:41)
marnia has a costume based off (82:38 - 82:44)
kyogre but not marnie (82:41 - 82:48)
not marnie marnia isn't that marina (82:44 - 82:51)
oh yeah probably (82:48 - 82:51)
there you go in pokemon omega ruby alpha (82:51 - 82:55)
sapphire (82:54 - 82:58)
a kyogre knows surf will allow players (82:55 - 83:00)
to surf more quickly than others (82:58 - 83:03)
except for sharpedo this action has its (83:00 - 83:06)
own animation and larger hitbox (83:03 - 83:08)
additionally a kayaker that knows dive (83:06 - 83:10)
will allow the players to avoid (83:08 - 83:13)
underwater trainer battles this action (83:10 - 83:15)

thing kyogre may be a combination of kai (83:22 - 83:29)
ocean and orca the whale ah (83:25 - 83:33)
why is kai ocean (83:29 - 83:33)
is that like in another language in (83:33 - 83:36)
another language (83:35 - 83:40)

um primal kyogre has a good shiny (83:41 - 83:46)
only primal kyogre has a good shiny i'm (83:46 - 83:52)
not like huge on the purple kyogre (83:49 - 83:53)
i like purple a lot but i don't know it (83:52 - 83:57)
kind of reminds me of barney (83:53 - 83:57)

shuffle icon i think there's a (84:01 - 84:06)
primal one too isn't there yeah (84:03 - 84:08)
i don't know greg's the arbiter of (84:06 - 84:10)

they're both (84:14 - 84:17)
not great yeah they're actually actually (84:14 - 84:18)
kind of bad that's the (84:17 - 84:20)
first time i've ever heard complaints (84:18 - 84:21)
