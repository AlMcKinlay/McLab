[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 437th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me greg hello i am here i am 1 500th of the way to level 40 in pokemon go you're doing it is that why you want to trade a pokemon with me this morning i did because i realized i'd never finished that jump start thing because i needed to trade and it was always close then i wasn't near anybody so then i was like oh i should just clear some of this out and that got me to one 500 millionth of the way towards the thing i'm never going to get but the thing you're never going to get being level 40 yeah 40 before the fourth year before the end of the year what why does it have to be before the end of the year because then you get the gyarados hat they get the gyarados head is now the only special thing well greg we can do this we can work on it we can do this i need people bobby to open the gift i send them you i need you to get rid of everybody you currently have as a friend in pokemon go and get 200 new friends and just be like adamant diligent and it has to start tomorrow so by december 30th you can like get to that 30-day friendship level or something i think it's too late i think you're lost out yeah i've no i mean i'm working i'm working it as hard as i can well how much xp you need from 39 to 40. two million no it's five oh five million put it i put it in twitter hold on let me go let's let's fight nobody uses twitter anymore that's 5 million divided by 30. how much xp is that today uh will is also here yeah i am and unrelated to greg's pokemon go dilemma if you go to target on the day after they restock the shelves with pokemon cards with a shopping bag and you grab 10 of them champions pass because those are the only ten they have on the shelf because they're on discount for ten dollars and then you're just going to resell them on ebay you're a bad person wait your target doesn't have a limit i but i i feel like every target i've gone to in the last 30 days have had like limit to pokemon cards per person yeah i've seen that at mine but well when i was down in houston that's not what i saw it's a whole different taxes country down there uh all right i need 484 million 881 000 experience points which means i have to do 162 thousand seven hundred and fourteen experience a day through the rest of this year to meet that goal okay that's like gyarados hat that's like uh that's a best friend today you said uh that's a best friend today you said 130 000 162 000 experiences well this is easy greg that's just eight raids a day because a raid gives you 20 000 with a lucky egg we do have a show for you guys the big news story is the yuri geller thing so we will get to that okay the bigger news story to me is yuri geller is still alive oh i was gonna say the bigger news story is how many people didn't know cadabra cards were not being printed that is like the actual new story the amount of people that had no clue that this was actually a thing for the last 20 years so i guess we'll talk about that i could have swore your yellow died but guess what poor james randy did before yuri geller that's like sad i figured james randy would have taken him with him one would only hope we got some uh tcg stuff some pokemon go stuff some pokemon master stuff some pokemon cafe mix stuff but let's start with the announcement of an announcement it's a very pokemon thing they love doing this so the announcement of the announcement was at the macy's thanksgiving day parade where they revealed that next year is their 25th anniversary which for probably anyone listening to show is like how is this news because we've been talking about this we know that uh you know when said sun and moon came out in 2016 that was their 20th anniversary they made a pretty big deal about that um that was the same year pokemon go launched that was uh the year of mythicals those the year sun and moon launched they did a whole brand new plush line for that i believe they opened up a brand new pokemon center in japan during that time that was also when they released xy evolutions which is their best selling tcg set of all time that was in november of 2016 that was the set where they reprinted base set and that set had like six different charizards in it so a lot of things happened in 2016 and now this is uh going to be their 25th which i would say most companies do a bigger thing for their 25th than they do for their 20th i would have yes yes it's more of a more notable anniversary typically yes i'll just read what they have on pokemon.com it's really really short because again this is announcement of the announcement they said the famous pikachu sword among the skyscrapers of manhattan in the 2020 macy's thanksgiving day parade the iconic pokemon appeared holding a snowman pikachu and wearing a scarf in preparation for the cold weather a special troupe of dancing pikachu accompanied the balloon revealing the logo for the 25th anniversary coming in 2021 held in new york city on thanksgiving day november 26th this is the 20th time that pikachu balloon proudly took its place in the prestigious parade have a happy holiday season we look forward to more news for the 25th anniversary here on pokemon.com overall the announcement was pretty much nothing i do think that this is a uh 700 iq play by the pokemon company big brains here uh because a lot of non-pokemon fans watch this parade and it is a good way of letting people know that next year is going to be a big year and put pokemon on their radar early i i don't know i guess this stuff works like i know like for me personally like harley davidson is here in milwaukee where i live and the only time i really hear a lot about harley davidson is like every five years when it's one of their anniversaries because they like they make a big deal about it in the city like every the 30th the 35th the 40th i'm not sure what the year they're on i think they're over 50. they've been around a while yeah i guess this this makes sense to to put that seed out there for people so canto remakes next year we can only hope 25 years play it again okay so what what would they have on the docket next year they would have pokemon unite is that going to happen yeah i don't see they're already the only thing that's not going to happen is pokemon sleep yeah yeah if you're in china you can play it technically um because they're pokemon sleep no um unite oh cause they have they have a beta program going on right now um so unite snap pokemon snap uh detective pikachu the new pokemon snap thank you very much sorry the new pokemon snap so that's that's three games right there unite snap detective pikachu um maybe sleep so that's four [Laughter] sleep is not happening they've never talked about it again that's true i will say that um for what it's worth the company working on pokemon sleep also made magikarp jump and magikarp jump did have an update last week somebody hit the button they meant to hit two years ago yeah so uh that's probably a good sign that's actually probably that's expansion no it was it just fixed uh a bug i think on ios 14. but that that is legit a good sign you know if they weren't if they didn't have a contract with a pokemon company they probably wouldn't have been able to update or whatever or it wouldn't care to update because why bother at that point i would probably expect another new mobile game right they've been pretty much putting out one mobile game a year maybe well i guess maybe that's unique it's gonna be it's not gonna be a tower defense game i'm out no no no no we're getting a new expansion of pokemon shuffle a new version of shuffle i still strongly believe they're going to really push forward with their live events especially with pokemon go regardless of the world probably a game on switch i can't imagine that their 25th anniversary they're not going to put a game on switch whether that's the only thing i i would be confident saying it won't be is a generation nine they usually like their generations to breathe and yeah get their mileage up yeah so yeah it is going to be a dlc for sword and shield that brings you to kanto oh my god perfect well i would have i would i suppose all the announcements are probably going to be made in february because that's pokemon days february 28th i wouldn't be surprised yeah february 28th i think saw my anniversary because that's when the green and red came out in japan japan yep i would not be surprised actually february 27th i know it's the 20th century my bad i would not be surprised if they are to do another detective pikachu movie if we hear about it next year not necessarily we get it but we at least hear about it oh they're probably going to put the rude movie out on like pokemon day aren't they yeah um that'd be a good call because yeah it's probably not gonna happen for christmas no well japan will get it for christmas i think it's in theaters in japan so good luck [Laughter] i don't know what a japanese movie theater looks like though i don't either does it look like an american movie theater or does it look like some what else would it look like i don't know like some spaceship they're in the face japan's always ahead of us right they got is it like a karaoke booth where you'd have a couch and a screen and four people because i'd be into that that'd be actually pretty cool i mean it looks the same it looks it looks just like ours oh bummer wait this is wait hold on there's a mini theater is this actually in japan no oh wait a mini theater is a type of japanese independent movie theater that is not under the direct influence of major any major film companies it still looks like our theater hmm it's not mini in any way yeah the tokyo theater looks like the same like i'm not seeing this is gripping i am content i am curious if they're going to do anything for sword and shield because yeah i just seems like that's a long time between i mean we had a full year of sword and shield during that full year we had two expansions assuming that another pokemon game comes out in the fall which is not always the case but mostly the case true that's a whole year of nothing and i don't as much as i love the free or the as much as i love the promoted raid weekends they do once a month or they have been doing once a month um that's obviously doesn't appeal to everyone and they keep rotating the seasons of what pokemon are allowed and not allowed uh and i think series seven which is the current rule set goes till the end of january but again that also doesn't appeal to everyone i i don't personally think there's going to be like this final expansion that adds the remaining 260 missing pokemon i don't see that oh heck no but i don't i don't know what else they would do i already told you the kanto tickets coming a train from from uh europe to japan yep a bullet train from europe to japan it goes under the sea it goes it goes through kalos though you'll be able to see kalos on your way to canto that's what they're going to do because remember on that that section of the kalos map there was the train station that went nowhere oh my gosh this is literally conversations people on [Laughter] i don't even know what's worse than reddit the train is going to go from galler through sinnoh not stopping sinnoh no remakes for gen 4 loop around johto a couple of times and end in kanto all right this is what we're missing everything even though it's the 25th anniversary they kind of like went overboard with all of the during the 20th anniversary for original blue green red yeah why would they not do it again why would they not just put like red blue and yellow on because because we are also at the 20th anniversary of pokemon games that came out in 2005 oh that's 15th anniversary dagnabbit yeah we're gonna be looking at two thousand all right what pokemon games came out in 2000 you ready pokemon puzzle challenge okay and a remake of that pokemon puzzle league that was the good one oh that's a good one pokemon stadium 2 oh crystal and pikachu's great surfing adventure now games that came out in 2005 and this is really what i was looking at poke park fishing rally ds when we be looking at 2001 for 20th did you say 2000 or 2001 oh dagnabbit you're right it's next year oh man my calculations are off all right 2001 2001. now okay card let's go shopping pokemon card gp2 okay all right well it's not that one as much as i pokemon card gb2 here comes team gr okay pokemon crayon kids that's it that's getting remade oh i'm excited for whatever that was for some reason super smash bros melee is listed as a pokemon game yes they are listed on party one.com as well pokemon party mini pokemon zany cards pokemon pinball mini pokemon puzzle collection those are all your 2001's i could deal with a new pokemon pinball on the switch our 2006's pokemon ranger yes pokemon ranger 15th anniversary pokem pokemate i don't even know what that is that a dating app yeah it was predated um okcupid pokemon diamond and pearl 15th anniversary pokemon battle revolution there you go those are your fifteens i missed battle revolution it was a bad game but i mean you got a little charm to it pokemon battle revolution was fun it was just not enough fun for them yeah it was it was like it was like it's just so expensive it was like if you if you bought just the uh just the dojo part of isle of armor yeah it's just like you got this is good but this is all you get and you're not allowed to leave this building well sounds like it's appropriate for this day and age okay i mean it did give us a great sound board though that's true it's how we know how to say milotic correctly speaking of announcements for announcements uh let's switch over to some pokemon go news real quick a couple hours ago niantic tweeted a raid with a 48 hour timer above it as of us recording this podcast the timer has like 28 hours left or something and it said like incoming transmission and then it showed the timer um and then it showed a pink egg which if you don't know your colors off the top of your head the pink eggs are one star eggs used to be two star eggs as well but they got rid of two stars um the yellow eggs are three star eggs and then the whatever the the legendary then mega so legendary is the silver eggs and then mega is the weird mega dna egg looking things i guess they're tan but then they glow colors there are four eggs in pokemon go and this is a pink one they made a 40 second video of this egg spinning so i would assume that somebody at niantic didn't pick the wrong color although i wouldn't put it past them what's on the banner on the plane that flies past oh i can explain this um so they had two trailers for this announcement of the announcement if uh if you're wondering when the 48 hours is supposed to end it ends during it ends the day the kalos pokemon get added to the game which is december 1st i think and this is what we talked about last week with bobby which uh bobby thought the egg was going to be scatterbug and i said um i don't know if that seems right and then i forgot what greg and i speculated i was i'm still on furforu so oh yeah for free for free and i'll get all the haircuts and you're all like never gonna be perfu um so shoot down all my good ideas so i i tweeted this yesterday but uh right before the trip but right before it flickers to the egg it flickers to the psychic background on psychic pokemon there's a there's only like 78 new pokemon in kalos or something like that there's not a lot of them that are not that many psychic um but there is one psychic pokemon that stands out and then if you watch the second trailer there's a there's a plane that is flying and there's a number on the plane and that number is the same number as esper's pokedex number oh [Applause] it's like uh 677 or something like that i love the internet because you can watch you can watch people set their own expectations and then you can watch them 48 hours later get extremely mad at everyone but themselves let me give you an example yesterday when they first showed this trailer the amount of comments i saw of oh it's going to be mew and they're going to turn it shiny finally okay yeah sure i'm sure niantic's going to put mu in a one star raid or maybe yeah i'm sure they forgot that uh maybe that mythical pokemon shouldn't be in a pink egg and it should maybe be in a silver egg or something but yeah sure maybe mew oh they're bringing back mewtwo okay well let's apply the first logic to that as well um mewtwo has always been in the silver legendary raid but yeah sure maybe the who they just messed up maybe pink egg no big deal uh i liked hoopa that was a good that was a good one too [Laughter] zygarde as well oh gosh what else did people suggest those are the those are the four that i saw a lot was mew with being shiny of course mewtwo zygarde and hoopa oh the other one i saw a lot was galerion slowpoke which gallerian slowpoke would pick the would fit a pink egg a one star raid but i just why would you release a pokemon debuted in gen 8 on the day you're promoting gen 6. just yeah very true so now that we've seen now fast forward to today because all of those speculations were yesterday and i think people have finally accepted its esper because of the number in the background and now people are mad because why would niantic hype up esper this dex filler pokemon there are there are plenty of things that niantic has done slash the pokemon company has done that that has definitely surprised me but esper is not one of them i feel like i remember the launch of x and y pretty well and i remember that people wouldn't shut up about esper like out of out of all the new pokemon esper was talked about a lot there's a lot of fan art of esper there was a lot of memes with esper well yeah cause it's got those eyes yeah yeah they just kind of stare it probably had dead eyes the most merchandise of any pokemon that wasn't a starter or a legendary in that generation as well so yeah i don't know you could say like why hype up esper why make mareep so rare like it's just a sheep yeah it's like like marie is like one of the first sheep you find in gold and silver like it's why why did they make it so rare i don't know why why did they put vullabay a pokemon that no one really cares about in 12k team rocket eggs like this like that question is kind of silly because like that in itself is something not new how pokemon go treats just random pokemons and they do they they have been successful with it right like people do care when they see him a reap in the wild people did care when they say they saw a gibble in the wild like in past pokemon games gibbel is not that hard to find heck and sword and shield you find a cave with 40 gibbles running around you like also like pokemon go has has made shanks this pokemon that people are willing to spend one dollar on because hey it's only in raids and it could be shiny so i think it's fine it's whatever like i remember how many dollars did you spend for your shiny shanks i know you keep track of every dollar you sp dollar per pokemon i think the most free range i know exactly how much you spent for uh d-axis uh was it turakion um i hadn't spent that much for trayaki and i think i only spent eight bucks on him you spent like a billion dollars for deoxys i did yeah diaxis was my was my uh uh the only one that i really spent a lot on yeah i probably probably eight dollar like i i usually only use free raid passes on like uh shinx unless there's a bunch of people around and they're like oh drop out those strings with us and i was like all right peer pressure so i guess get excited for esper okay i will finish the uh pokemon go news here real quick not a lot of stuff obviously gen 6 launching soon level 50 launching soon as well beginning on tuesday december 1st again this is when all the changes are happening mega blastoise mega charizard y mega pidgeot and mega houndoom will be leaving mega raids uh mega raids will now feature mega charizard x mega gengar and mega obama snow kirum will be returning to raids from december 1st to january 1st for the whole month to encounter the boundary pokemon can it be shiny uh it doesn't say so probably no don't know that's a no karim's been and yeah this is the second time kieran came back right yeah yes i know i have a carom that's okay and in addition we think i'm chairman kimmy today i think will by that church i believe you are correct yes the church of kirim yep uh mega obama snow making its debut um and then the spotlight hours every tuesday night tuesday december 1st will be seal december 8th swine nub december 15th a surprise pokemon it's probably pikachu i don't know mewtwo uh mew but shiny lugia uh december 22nd snow runt december 29th snover your double catch xp will end on december 31st and yeah i think uh oh sorry last bit of pokemon good news um mesprit ooxie and azelf have returned and they will leave on monday november 30th at 1pm pst they were here for a week you could remote raid pass with them they're leaving again i'm sure they'll uh they'll be very excited to bring them back and give them a special move and then take them away and then bring them back and make them shiny and then take them away and then bring them back and make them shiny and give them the special move i still only have aself i don't think i have any of them it's all right let me just repeat what i just said i mean i'm not worried about it okay i think that's all we got for pokemon go and the thanksgiving day stuff uh oh also to piggyback to go back to the pig the thanksgiving stuff they they did release this new pikachu logo with a two and a five on its cheeks and then the background with all the starter pokemon which looks really cool they did update pokemon pokemon.com to have that new branding okay let's take a break we're gonna talk about this yuri geller stuff and some other tcg stuff and um i think that's it so we'll be right back cool [Music] with netflix i am partnered with twitter twitch youtube and pretty much all of the internet internet full disclosure full disclosure i am partnered

do appreciate it yeah enjoy the episode and we are back let's do the the yuri geller stuff so let's uh we're gonna trace this back a little bit because on saturday this news kind of broke but uh it actually started a little bit before that i believe it started on friday and i believe the source was because of an article on the gamer what is the gamer uh a website uh i can tell you at the top of their website they have gen shin impact tg originals which i'm assuming is the gamer originals game news guides reviews more uh this is written by josh kolluson and it's titled why there hasn't been a cadabra pokemon card for almost 20 years which is correct i believe it's been 19 years so and then it starts off with update geller has since reached out to the gamer to comment on the situation we'll get to that first let's uh go over this article cadabra hasn't appeared on a pokemon card since the early 2000s i think exactly 2001 in the very last set that wizards of the coast printed which i can't remember what that said it's called off the top of my head but the reason that cadabra hasn't appeared is thanks to the spoon bending illusionist yuri geller pokemon cards weren't just something kids bought frantically in the late 90s as the case with pretty much everything pokemon has put their name on the tcg has continued to grow into something bigger we can only only imagine now close to a thousand pokemon that's not the case for cadabra though the first gen psychic pokemon hasn't been on a pokemon card of its very own since the early 2000s not because it's waiting in line for its next opportunity but because the real life person it is based on in japan cadabra's name is junger younger it gets that along with the spoons found in its hands from the illusionist yuri geller not so much from geller per se it was more of a case of pokemon's creators naming cadabra without the magician without letting the magician know it didn't sit well with geller and at the turn of the century he decided to take legal action geller not only sued nintendo in 2000 for basing cadabra on him but he requested that pokemon stop he requested the pokemon stop being used in the tcg here we are 20 years later and it would appear that the ruling still stands since cadabra is the middle evolution pokemon including abra and alakazam geller's lawsuit only proved problematic for three pokemon rather than one even though both appear in the tcg their inclusion is problematic since cadabra cannot join them there have been workarounds over the years which is true you there's plenty of alakazam cards that just or alakazam or just abra rare candy cadet abra rare candy alakazam abra was included in the mysterious treasure set ah that was the set that was the last set it was in last set that magic uh wizard to the coast printed pokemon eliminated the problem of kadabra's uh absence by giving abra the ability to leapfrog straight into alakazam as for cadabra's evolved form it also has appeared sporadically over sporadically sporadically over the years however yep when it does make an appearance it is a basic pokemon so it doesn't need to have the evolved form of cadabra alakazam has appeared in ex and in v cards that's true there's just there's in the newest set vivid voltage there is alakazam v needless to say cadabra cards are pretty hard to come by and that was pretty much the entire article there's not a lot to it right it's just a pretty general article that says it doesn't really go into the lawsuit it kind of just talks about the last set it was in some new cards but i guess yuri geller saw said article and then commented on it he tweeted he commented uh on it but he pretty much let me see if i can get his exact tweet here his exact tweet is i am truly sorry for what i did 20 years ago kids and grown-ups i am releasing the ban it's all up to ninten nintendo to bring back my hashtag kadabra pokemon card back it will probably be one of the rarest cards now much energy and love and then they and then he posted his website uh yuri gellermuseum.com that's kind of it yeah so basically he has realized that he's completely irrelevant and was like let me grasp at straws by trying to attach myself to this very popular uh franchise or you know media conglomerate oh i made a i made a mistake i'm sorry sky ridge was the last time cadabra appeared uh which was 2002 in japan so about 18 years ago do you think though like i mean i'm sure he was mad obviously he sued nintendo uh for for his likeness but he probably just forgot about it right well i mean i think he sat on it thinking that at some point they would come through with money and instead they're just like or no we're gonna we're just never gonna print it again like we'll just work around it and then it's interesting that after the 25th anniversary is announced he comes forward and says oh hey you can let this happen again so i'm sure the 25th anniversary did its job to remind everybody that this is a thing and i'm sure he's just like i'm sick of getting this these mail also i'm not relevant and certain segments of the population think i'm dead i might as well at least grab a bit of headlines right after the 25th anniversary hits and everybody's talking about it yeah i can see that i just love the fact that it's we'll bring my kadabra yours no it doesn't belong to you okay so the the actual news here is the amount of people that didn't realize that there hasn't been a cadaver card in 18 years well i mean that is the news right there yeah that's that's the that's the actual news yeah because over there there's been plenty of ways to you know like rare candy abilities um v cards ex cards there's been plenty of ways to play alakazam i don't think there's ever been a like there's probably been like one or two okay alakazams but i i can't think of any off the top of my head that saw like a lot of play regardless but at the time pokemon was the biggest thing in the world when he did this lawsuit yeah i'm gonna pull the snorlax monster's tweet who who works with bubblepedia and i and um he's been on the show before but uh his exact tweet is he had a really solid case they based the pokemon almost directly on his likeness with the japanese name being almost exactly the same as his name and he performed his signature trick which is the bending of the spoons you have a pokemon that's like based on you doing the thing that you do which is bending spoons and now the the thing is the biggest thing in the world at the time and you're not seeing any money or no one asked you or it's also the same as like hitmonlee and hitmonchan bruce lee and jackie chan i almost said produce chan bruce lee and bruce chan and jackie lee i mean let's did they see pokemon no they didn't let's be fair bending spoons happened and has existed long before yuri geller like people claiming that oh they stole his trick no it's one of the things he does the problem was the name he also didn't like the star in the forehead and the lightning patterns because he felt that uh those were um symbolism for the ss which it's a bit of a stretch in being israeli like that was part of his whole thing and he didn't feel like they a they were honoring him with the name and b that they were uh mocking him by picking highly charged imagery on this pokemon there's a lot of stretching in there except for the name yeah the name they really should have done something different i mean it's cl it's close enough that people are like oh i can see it but i think and i think a lot of people and the ninja company included things like bending spoons has existed since ever when when people trying to rip people off exist like all time like when spoons were invented and became metal they've been scamming people over this trick forever especially you know victorian area when the whole psychic thing was huge it was a weak it was a weak case except for the name which is why they just let it sit like he if he had a strong case it wouldn't have sat for 20 years do you think bruce lee jackie chan would have had a better slash equal case with hitmonlee hitmonchan no because those pokemon don't look like them yeah and and honestly you can honestly say in all of asia there's lots of lees and there's lots of chances i mean they based the name off of their fighting style which it kind of get that whole that whole area is really gray with fair use and parody and blah blah blah like there's a lot of gray area and there's not a lot his case was based on your defaming my character and that is not easily proved by anything that is in there like that is part of the reason why the case has just literally gone nowhere because you still have to prove that it's causing harm to you like his whole idea is that it made him the laughingstock news flash you already were yeah whether or not you believed that this didn't add or take away from that which is why it's literally gone nowhere i mean it's been sitting in court waiting for an agreement until he finally gave up i mean if if he had a solid solid case they would have had to have fixed everything they would have had to removed it from the games they would have had to remove it or pay him a lot of money he didn't have a solid case he still doesn't yeah so it's so i i get frustrated people like oh you totally like no it's not totally you are making the leap that he made but it's also a leap you don't have to make like when somebody points it out and then you're like oh yeah i see it oh yeah i see it but you didn't immediately thank yuri geller when you saw that pokemon no because yuri geller is all but forgotten right today's kids that's why that's why i like love your guys's input it's because i remember i was so the last card was 2004 2002 so i would have been 13 14 years old and like i remember i remember them talking about yuri geller and cadabra at the time i remember that like oh that dude's a magician and that dudes sp ben spoons and like that's kind of it and then i didn't really think anything of it besides like oh they might not make cadabra cards anymore so like i didn't know as a kid i didn't know how big yuri geller was and obviously as a kid i didn't understand lawsuits or anything i mean yuri geller was popular in the 70s right like he was a big illusionist magician way back in the day um and then he claimed he had psychic powers which whatever and that's what started the fight between him and james randy that has dogged them forever he was you're and in 2002 he was already like washed up yeah yeah he hadn't had i don't think he had had an uh a television special a book uh a tour i don't think at any of those since the late 80s at best because he had started a bunch of lawsuits in the 90s that once again went nowhere and then he sued again in 98 for the same reason that he sued the pokemon company saying that what they were showing and debunking psychic feats was unfair to him and other magicians because they're real psychics he sued ikea uh because in 1999 he sued ikea for having bent legs that was called the yuri line so he took them on because bending is his thing he is the so desperate for fame that he sues everybody and he keeps thinking he's gonna win and he doesn't he's just irrelevant um but you know nintendo's like fine if this is how you're gonna be we're just going to skip it and i think as he's getting older realizing look i might as well become i might as well become a good guy to a bunch of people at their 25th anniversary i mean he's 73 yeah so yeah i looked up how old he was i mean it is it is the timing is perfect and i i saw that the author of the josh collusion um i saw that the author said that he wrote the cadabra article why cadabra hasn't been in tcg for 20 years he wrote that he said like a couple months ago but he just it was it wasn't like completely done and he just decided to publish it this week which or this past week which makes sense because you know pokemon is now on everyone's mind because they said it at the macy's day parade um so the timing was really great and then i'm sure yuri geller saw it saw the article specifically about him yep saw that pokemon no that dude has a google alert oh heck yeah you know he's got a googler is anybody in the world talking about me please please please um saw that you know this is the 25th anniversary next year and then he decided to make a statement i mean it all it all lines up but yeah the author the author was like oh yeah this was just something i was working on and off on i just decided to publish it this week i don't blame them for publishing it this past week because yeah pokemons yeah the news this week so good time to publish your because they're not a specific pokemon website you know they just publish game news i'd like to i don't like maybe it's it's hard to be excited about it because like i'm sure they already have the next like one year of sets planned out for the tcg in japan at least because they release sets once a month uh i'm sure they know what they're releasing you know september of 2021 in japan because they just continue to produce cards left and right so i think it would be maybe slightly more exciting once like a cadaver card does show up but at the end of the day it's like it's it's so irrelevant in like the grand scheme of things yeah 100 yep like so many people even know there wasn't cadaver cards so like like i like i'm sure there are there there are plenty of haunter cards there are plenty of macho cards uh name your middle evolution they got them name how much they're actually used not it's just a filler card right it's a skip over uh even even with middle evolutions that existed most decks just ran rare candies um to get around it like the only middle evolution that was like pretty dominant was probably like fro or frogadier uh and that's only because froggeteer had like a really good frogadier could help you find other froggy deer so it's like actually really good but most of the time you would just rare candy around it in the tcg i don't remember the last time cadabra showed up in the anime because his the the ruling was just for tcg stuff which again makes sense at the time because tcg was like the biggest thing back then but i don't remember the last anime appearance also it's easier because the uh because tcg cards are like a print production then you know copyright and that kind of legal stuff is easier to apply than to say a video game production or an animated production right it's print is very clear because you can say you know authorship and everything like that okay it looks like uh the last time abra or sorry cadabra appeared was the 146 episode of ruby and sapphire which is the 420th episode of the pokemon anime nice it was broadcasted in japan on 2005 and in the united states um in 2006 and that was the card ban was 2000 won 2002 yeah for 2001. so yeah kadab kadabra hasn't appeared in the anime for 14 years i mean a lot of things yeah and as they proceed through the generations they don't necessarily bring back ones from older generations yeah i mean i i would expect at some point we may now see it in journeys i mean also the last time jinx appeared in the anime was also 2006. they've been cleaning house yeah i think his like apology might have been like slightly better if he didn't say my cadaver and he didn't then plug his website at the end of the post no i mean it's he's just just trying to like latch on to this star to like bring some relevance to dying fame yeah i just love his pin tweet do you believe the cia does no it doesn't but sure well there's his uh probably like the the next time i think people will talk about yuri geller is probably when he like passes away he dies and nobody thinks that he died and then people will be like you remember when he got into a tiff with nintendo what was that dude who fought who fought over that cadaver thing he died speaking of tcg stuff uh there's another tcg box the sword and shield elite trainer box plus featuring zashian or zamazenta as the name suggests there are two different versions of the set one focusing on galler's region legendary warrior pokemon which set you choose either zashi and v or zamazeta v will also feature 65 card sleeves elite trainer boxes will contain a variety of shiny metal accessories you will get a metal coin featuring zashi and zamazenta six metal damage counter dice and a set of metal condition markers these are normally plastic by the way not only that but it will include a player's guide a real book and a whopping 12 booster packs from the sword and shield series it doesn't specifically say what booster packs but that would probably include i'm assuming sword and shield rebel clash darkness ablaze vivid voltage i think those are the four i don't think i'm missing one usually an elite trainer box is eight uh if it's a special one like champions path it's ten uh but this is twelve yeah uh apparently they came out on november 20th i have not seen these in stores at all but also i can't find any pokemon stuff in stores because it's all still sold out everywhere can we talk about how pokemon.com needs to do better in these articles uh what's about what's wrong with this article besides as as a nod to the strength of these legendary metal type pokemon metal is yeah they're not in metal is it's not also what is the elect electric is not called electronics it's called lightning yeah why why are they switching names around it's always been metal in the but you haven't why well metal gallery pressed charges for using his spoons the steel industry like we're gonna we're gonna sue steel industry very upset uh yeah i don't know it's always been metal i even think they don't i i may be wrong but i think it's like they it's not dark energy but it's darkness and darkness yep it's darkness yeah darkness why uh is it because it's more universal probably right like i don't know is is like fire type in german called fire type or is it called like dang i don't know a good german word for a pun you don't know german at all uh guten tag schnitzel type yeah the tcg stuff is still uh still out of control people still cannot find vivid voltage the newest set i believe there is a reprint of vivid voltage coming out in that january like it makes why do some of the match and other ones don't like the only ones that don't match lightning darkness and metal it's wow well yeah it's just the way it is yeah the way it is look they they tried to bring in ferry it didn't work if they would have named it like if they dump fairy they can fix the names but the ccg doesn't have every type though which is also a problem no it would make the game worse i mean they have a lot of types they have retro energy they have heal energy they do that yeah they do have the special energies prism energy blend energy look flash energy well now those are just yeah those are special energy burning energy splash energy i mean they are already out of control aroma energy they have a rope they have stone energy this aroma aroma energy is new it just came out with vivid voltage see they could be fixing these things okay okay but uh like aroma energy or rainbow energy you can only have four in your deck whereas like horror energy uh dark darkness energy you can have as many as you want it's more like this this is like dual lands and magic shock lands tapped lands just clean up clean up your stuff patch lands ugh this is why nobody likes trading card games it's probably true hey they wreck on evie recently they can wreck on some other stuff in the game in the tcg no in the video games because in let's go pikachu let's go eevee they gave the female eevee the heart tale and then they rolled it out in pokemon go and then they rolled it down con that's a change oh this is a straight up change they just decided hey guess what this happens now all right final bit of news here is off pokemon.com recruit gallerian slowpoke in pokemon cafe mix team event i wonder whatever happened to that uh pk mencast group well since you refused to play horizontal games because of your weak wrists and the way you hold your phone weird you'll never know i was going to join the pkmag cast group but that was spelled wrong and then the person who spelled it wrong apologized and then left the group and then it put somebody else in charge of the group and we don't know who that person is down the rabbit hole we go we can't make a new group because it shares the name with the other group which is spelled technically wrong anyways a new team event has begun in cafe mix you can work with your squad to convince galerion slowpoke to join your cafe from november 18th through december 2nd a dopey pokemon will swing by your cafe for delicious treats as you and your team complete orders you will earn stars to raise galleries slowpoke satisfaction orders 551 through 600 have been added to the game geez seems like a lot expert players will be able to take on master cafe to level 276 to 300 have just been added good luck recruiting gallerian slowpoke and that's it they're still supporting this game that's probably good people probably like it i enjoyed it while i played it oh were we gonna talk about the masters tickets thing oh yeah yeah that was our final bit of news okay i was uh just gonna say they have given more fan service to cafe mix this year than the like four years pokemon duel existed this is very true very true or poor poor duel oh we should talk about the tcg drama in the ptc geo we'll save that till next week okay because that'll unfortunately i didn't plan the yuri geller stuff to happen and that was 25 minutes of our life for never getting back 25 minutes that yuri's excited about it last bit of news before we move on uh is just a minor pokemon go news uh they are adding their first gen eight trainer which is gloria not go masters oh sorry did i say go with my bad yeah like what full disclosure i am partnered with dna um some people didn't know the protagonist's names uh gloria and victor it's supposed to be like glory and victory oh nice that's what it's like sword shield glory victory anyways uh gloria is being added um she will appear between november 29th 10 p.m to december 20th 10 p.m um she will be with zashian which i think is some people are saying it's backwards because normally it's like the boys the first game and the girls the second game so it's elio and celine for like sun and moon elio yeah but in this case i think people were referencing she got zashian because zashian's the girl even though also this blue people's minds uh so zashian and zamazenta are genderless pokemon but if you read zamasunta's pokedex entry it says specifically that zashian is his or his older sister zashian is older than zamasunta and the pokedex refers to it as a sister um this isn't the first time they've done that because manafee is also a genderless pokemon but the pokedex entry refers to manaphy as the prince of the sea i don't know why not here to argue about pokemon genders don't talk about the voice controversy that she's not scottish would she be scottish people people because she wears somewhat stereotypically or traditional scottish outfit with the hat and everything so people were assuming that her voice would be scottish but definitely over in the the britain side with their voice actor so there was a bit of a there's a bit of a thing people like she has a voice and it's british i don't know anything about scottish or british clothes to make that assumption yeah i agree it's the hat and the sweater uh they also are they also gave a bonus which i think as long as you log in five days between now and december 20th you will get these tickets you will get a hundred and twenty scout tickets how much does it cost greg to pull from that 25 30 30. oh it does it does cost exactly 30. yeah it costs exactly 30. so you get four free five-star polls which i would argue is pretty generous you don't get generous you don't get to pick the polls you don't get to pick they are they are random welcome to gotcha but they are all five stars and it's not clear if new upcoming five stars aka gloria will be added into that pool oh that's what i was saving my tickets for because what if they add new sink pairs to it um but i'm sure people have already spent them i've already spent them what the what why didn't you save them i have a bunch of five stars i need to get the chances of me getting gloria are just as bad like i didn't what are the appearance rates i think it's like three percent for each one in that bundle um there are also offering rate everything's at 3.448 so that's pretty good better than a shiny i mean i'm probably like having done my initial polls and being like oh well these ain't great i am going to just see if glory is added in they changed the app icon they had a retweet goal where if you retweet if they got 10 000 retweets was it ten thousand something like that they would give everyone a bonus three thousand gems uh which they hit i think they hit it within less than 48 hours um they are also giving everyone 10 000 gems by logging in every day for the rest of the year so that starts i believe probably by the time this podcast comes up so if you haven't played masters or you are on and off in masters or maybe you just like opening apps and collecting the daily items and then closing the apps uh this would probably be the best time to start because um you're gonna be getting 3000 gems i think the 3000 gems goes out on actually the 3000 gems should be going out by the time you hear this podcast and then you can get another 10 000 gems and then you can get the four free five star sync pairs and they are doing a bunch of bonus items but we don't need to waste anyone's time of like all the other bonus items you'll just collect them they'll go into your inventory you'll eventually use them it'll be clear why you have them you'll be like what are these 18 different sodas doing they did announce that two new holiday sink pairs are coming they showed the trainers one is skyla one is erica they have not revealed those pokemon yet for those people and then they're bringing back sigma suit red blue and leaf which is i s you could either argue they're bringing them back because it increases revenue or they're bringing them back because it's nice oh you know what i was going to ask you greg yeah uh because i don't play any other gotcha games the talking the word on the street is that pokemon masters has a lot of banners and they keep rotating banners very quickly i haven't played any other masters games but my thought process is why wouldn't you have multiple banners because not everyone has every character and not everyone wants to pull on a different character and if the only banners you have is like vulchner and cynthia and if i'm a player and i don't care about vulcanur and i already have cynthia then i have no reason to pull but people are saying that this is a complaint that there's too many banners but isn't is that how other games do it is is it actually too many banners or generally banners are tied to whatever event is going on in the game so usually they'll put up a banner to say hey we've increased these or we're adding in this new character and then in a lot of gotcha cases that new character just goes back into the pool so the banner usually is here's the heightened of this and then they go into the general pool um only only rarely do they have like hey you know like uh brave exodus final fantasy has specialty banners especially characters that only come around once in a while they're they're the ones that also sort of do this because they are tied to the very specific characters but those banners don't come up a lot why it's a complaint is there's a lot of banners which means you have that weird tension of i don't have anything to look forward to and i have so many things to that are highlighted that i have to split my focus so it is a sort of weird like oh there's seven things for me to pull on which do i go to also what are you gonna add because they have the thing of once that banner goes away those characters go away so it's like you saying to me why aren't you saving your five star tickets for gloria that's part of the problem is because they very much do the once the spanner's gone that character isn't in the pool um and that's where a lot of the complaint comes from because it's really sort of frustrating to be like well i really need this character so i'm going to save it for that banner to come around maybe or there's seven other banners that they have right now with really weird mixtures the banners tend not to make a lot of sense they don't they're not great at tying them to things that are going on so it just sort of comes across as a confused mess is it is it a huge problem no uh it would be nice that once they released a banner they put that character all the characters into the pool and didn't do this thing where they only come around whenever they decide like i think people are used to those things being holiday related and not this is just a character that exists and you released it for no good reason and then you took it away for no good reason like banners that get removed generally in other games are tied to specific holiday events and like regalia they recycle holiday events so in the middle of summer they're like we're bringing back halloween events and we're gonna bring back the halloween banner for a little bit um masters doesn't do that only other thing with the masters is they uh they put out an interesting tweet here uh it says uh coming soon a chance to get ten thousand gems on november 29th gloria and zashian from the gala region will be coming meaning sink pairs from all regions have arrived to celebrate and we will be holding a special rally starting today and then pictured is get up to 10 000 gems all regions assemble and we have red from kanto ethan from johto stevenstone from hohen then it goes to gloria from galler and then it goes into cynthia from sinnoh uh what's her name oh i'm blanking on her name right now serena from uh kalos and then how from alola and there is uh no gen 5 trainer here but there are eight different backgrounds and there's a hole and in that hole it is very i would say i would use the word people are speculating that that is uh the throne from unova but i think it's very obvious it is the throne from unova does that mean it's going to be n yeah that's that's the speculation is that they said a special character will be coming later this month and uh like all possible characters coming people guessed diantha and it never is her um but because they purposely left out a gen 5 trainer in this in this image and they're showing ends thrown i guess you could maybe say it could be getzus uh um but i think it's just never on the throne yeah um true yes the end was crowned was always like the in the background manipulation yeah he's he's the vizier off to the side pulling the strings plus if you look up thrown from inova it's literally a picture of ed sitting on that exact throne with that exact background so uh yeah i think that's exciting i think n is the most popular character from black and white what is n gonna get uh i think skyla is more popular well all right i mean skyla is way popular which legendary are they given in restaurant definitely resharam yes end was like never seen with zekrom i think there's like i think maybe in the manga he has both but yeah well depending on whether you play black or white he's got one or the other that's true he's always shown with restaurant if they if they we know that masters does not care and they do whatever they want that's not true he's probably gonna show up with uh volcarona i mean gloria has a legendary pokemon thus breaking the starters pattern so all bets are off that's true but it still makes sense because you know the protagonist doesn't show up with an esper the oh interesting i like the theory um i guess if they don't give him a legendary they give him zoroark right ah that's a good call i don't know what zoroark is gonna do in pokemon masters but sure yeah they're gonna even have purloin hmm i like the pearline what if they just give them lilly puff oh i got a shiny lily pup today and go oh no all right greg give us our question of the week i want to hear the question of the week only the question of the week will do don't know any of these songs it's after it's after thanksgiving get ready people we all know what happens to me after thanksgiving valentine's day no i am allowed to break into the collection that has forbidden all other times of the year so you're going to be like the weather outside is frightful but the questions are so delightful you got it since we've got no place to go ask away ask away okay shout out to uh lewis for sending in the yuri geller stuff i we had a ton of people send that in but hey attic channel gets their shoutouts uh this is from patrick to piggyback on a thanksgiving theme what bird pokemon would best symbolize for thanksgiving since we don't have a turkey pokemon as of now how delicious do you think ho-oh is mmm true i feel like that's very ashy but it would cook itself exactly to just the right like just the right amount why do people think ho oh is a turkey did they never see harry potter i don't think phoenixes have those big peacock type tales that peacocks and turkeys have yeah turkeys have sea cocktails yeah they have the yeah that spreads out yeah come to my neighborhood i will show you a bunch of angry turkeys and i went past like 20 turkeys and i was like get me out of here before they attack they are mean they are mean and territorial i don't know why minneapolis is overrun we have wild turkeys wild turkeys i don't know like i don't i don't think the pokemon birds are like good eating birds i mean blaziken yeah another one that cooks itself yeah combustion is a chicken though so wouldn't yeah what about farfetch you can have duck on thanksgiving oh yeah duck is reserved for christmas hmm i mean i'll eat duck any day i really like duck all the time this was my logic because oh boy because ho-oh is obviously a phoenix right no but go on you mean no it is continue i don't think there's any debate that it's not obviously a phoenix have you played the tcg greg it's ability literally brings it from the discard pile back onto your bench no because the tcg is garbage and uses garbage energy as we covered earlier darkness metal yeah there is no garbage energy yeah not yet not yet there's horror energy so give it time i love horror energy ah i would say if we're picking something for thanksgiving i would pick unpheasant because yes because pheasants are one of the game birds such as turkeys i don't know any other game birds besides quail okay quail do we have a quail pokemon though no ah i don't know what i don't i don't think i know what a quail is this is a tinier bird does it fly yes the turkeys can't fly yes they can not with that attitude um i don't think they're even chickens can fly where do you think turkeys sleep at night i'd never never thought that in the 30s this is the dandelion problem also thought about it either until i was walking my dogs in the morning and a flock of turkeys angry at me dive bomb me from the trees they were sleeping so here's the thing and it's it's because you guys i i don't know what the right word is but you think if something flies that it has to fly like 50 miles no a bird can fly that only flies like 10 feet like a chicken will fly 10 feet and that's as far as it's gonna go a turkey will fly up to a tree branch it's not gonna fly across the country it's no goose but it can still fly yeah it still flies it absolutely flies just doesn't fly a lot uh what about galera and zapdos um that is kind of turkey looking isn't it do people eat pheasants yes yeah oh you know people eat ostriches ostrich is real good yeah but michael is real good when they when okay hold on this is a dumb question people eat pheasants probably the same way they eat turkey right like put out sandwich slice it up no no pheasants usually roasted like duck tends to be yeah they're very small it's not it's not like people eat pigeon too so so you're saying turkey is the biggest of the game birds well turkey's not a game bird yeah it doesn't have a gamey taste we've gotten rid of that i mean i thought game birds was just a term of like this is a bird we hunt now that's different there's a gamey taste to them i have now i have to look at the the exact term why how is it uh let's see game birds quail grouse partridge oh great how did we forget that bob white i don't know what a bobwhite is pheasant more grouse more quail hey you're not that friendly it's a robbery to you wild turkey is official game bird well yeah but it has to be a wild turkey it has to be a wild turkey not a domestic turkey oh i see so if you're not truly celebrating thanksgiving if you didn't hunt your own turkey they didn't have their own turkey like that either those things have been raised for as long as chickens have been raised i wonder what how they define what a game bird is i think anything that you could hunt then becomes a game bird oh game bird a bird hunted for sport or food i don't know what gamey means like when you say it has a gamey taste i don't think i've ever so you will notice that with some of the non-farmed meats that there is a just it's a distinctive flavor to it that i want to say it's an earthy flavor yeah it's just less palatable right it's less enjoyable to the human palette how do you feel about dark meat on turkey don't like dark meat so take the dark meat flavor and intensify it and that gets near the gamey flavor of a lot of the game birds oh that is like duck has a slight duck has a slight gaminess to it but like if you've ever had goose goose is a gamey bird yeah it's delicious but it has to be prepared well and oh we made a goose once in our house and never again never again uh okay so back to so ho-oh is the game bird no one why would you hunt guys what is he gonna do with it he's gonna resurrect your cat when your cat dies no he's not my cat's not chosen if if if my cat shows up with a rainbow feather i am yanking that rainbow feather as a as an extra life that cat already has nine lives i have one also cannot reproduce you can take a p dove and stick it stick it in the daycare with a ditto and produce unlimited dinners look we're not talking about factory farming at this point we are talking about the most dangerous game the most succulent game juicy on my table no if you if you really want like the most exquisite rare meat bird that you can get you gotta be hunting your lugias oh yeah take that take that dude down get it like lugia would be like going on like eating like a fish it's all sweaty it's kind of like eating seagull or pelican can you all agree that firo would just be stringy and gross yes 100 [Laughter] how thick that metal skin is because that could be a good cooking vessel on that sky marie oh kind of like crap yeah you throw the skarmory on the fire and it just like heats the outside and just cooks the meat on the inside and then you you unweld and crack that thing yeah and you just like dig in heck yeah haunch crow do people eat crow no no don't eat no don't eat grill only only if you said something that you have to take back i mean unpheasant is you know it's a pheasant it's not traditional it's it's it's a very it's a very old worldly uh holiday meal but you know true also 420 blackbirds so you could put a bunch of hank's crow into a pie and have sure that up do you think kids even like repeat that nursery rhyme any longer no oh wow what about celestialis that's just like a bamboo and rocket engine i mean i do like some bamboo shoots that's right there how about we go vegetarian and just eat gem bluff jump off salads for everyone no thank you uh so we're settling on unpheasant yeah give them the point because that's the winner what about pidgeot what bird is it even pigeon but it's just like nobody wants is pidgeot a pigeon what else would it be yeah i mean p dove is a pigeon yeah there are multiple types of pitches all right you can actually eat dove too yeah literally becoming an animal podcast and i'm sure there's like three people who work at like a zoo that are very upset at this conversation mostly me i'm looking up all sorts of game bird options so all right well will give us our pokemon of the week so the last pokemon of the week since you guys didn't solve it last week while i was not here uh was very short so let me just read it again i was hardcore napping and completely missed the text messages from steve and greg letting me know that recording was starting so i did not have a lot of time to prepare this week's pokemon in podcast lore this is the pokemon that greg defeated with a level 100 roselia i think it has a primal form and has been featured as the box art for two games it's stantler kroger did you say kroger like the grocery store you're both wrong stanley ain't never been box art for nothing look we the alternate pronunciation of kyogre is kroger we all know this this has been well established on this program yes kyogre is the correct answer it is a chi and an ogre i love ogres i don't know what a kai is i have to look at that there's a swashbuckler class in dungeons and dragons i do not know that oh heck yeah swashbuckling rogues heck yeah uh kyogre's special attack and attack and special defense and defense stats are reversed of groudons spencer's has a staff with kyogre's marking on it who is spencer oh it's that old dude from uh battlefrontier there you go primal kyogre has the highest base special attack stat base special defense stat and base stat total of all water type pokemon in pokemon battle revolution mar marnia has a costume based off kyogre but not marnie not marnie marnia isn't that marina oh yeah probably there you go in pokemon omega ruby alpha sapphire a kyogre knows surf will allow players to surf more quickly than others except for sharpedo this action has its own animation and larger hitbox additionally a kayaker that knows dive will allow the players to avoid underwater trainer battles this action has its own animation and larger hitbox i didn't know that i didn't know uh auras that surfing on a kyogre gives you a different pokemon yeah me either yeah i knew the torpedo thing kyogre may be a combination of kai ocean and orca the whale ah why is kai ocean is that like in another language in another language i think it's japan japanese um primal kyogre has a good shiny only primal kyogre has a good shiny i'm not like huge on the purple kyogre i like purple a lot but i don't know it kind of reminds me of barney a shuffle icon was there a kyogre shuffle icon i think there's a primal one too isn't there yeah i don't know greg's the arbiter of shuffle icon is better than the primal one and they're both not great yeah they're actually actually kind of bad that's the first time i've ever heard complaints about the shuffle why do they feel normal include the fins i i don't know because otherwise it's just a circle welcome to shuffle welcome to voltorb all right this week's pokemon of the week is going to be very easy and i may have done it before i'm not 100 sure you do not need to play the tcg to guess this week's pokemon in english this pokemon has had cards available only in the sword and shield expansion numbers 73 and 74. while in japanese it has been available as part of v starter set lightning sword v-starter decks and shiny star v one of the cards is a basic with 70 hp and two attacks byte410 and zap kick for 20. the second whose art prominently features its heart butt is also a basic with 70 hp and 2 attacks roar which does no damage but forces your opponent to switch their active pokemon with one of their benched pokemon and static shock which does 10 damage the listed pokedex entry on both cards reads this pokemon is very popular as a herding dog in the gala region as it runs it generates electricity from the base of its tail there you go easy
