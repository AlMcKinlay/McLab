episode of the Pokemon podcast it is (1:03 - 1:10)
super effective it's super effective (1:07 - 1:14)
stuff like that I'm your host SBJ and i (1:10 - 1:17)
am here solo like i said it is a special (1:14 - 1:20)
episode i will consider this episode 208 (1:17 - 1:22)
since it is pokemon relevant very (1:20 - 1:25)
pokemon relevant in fact that i will be (1:22 - 1:30)
reviewing pokin tournament now I say (1:25 - 1:34)
that with a question mark in my voice (1:30 - 1:39)
because I don't review stuff ever an oar (1:34 - 1:43)
has pokemon podcast calm or it's super (1:39 - 1:46)
effective the podcasts ever been focused (1:43 - 1:49)
or geared around reviews that's just not (1:46 - 1:51)
what we do we're just a bunch of guys (1:49 - 1:54)
that have been talking about what we (1:51 - 1:55)
like and don't like about pokemon for (1:54 - 1:59)
several years but I did get a review (1:55 - 2:01)
copy of poking tournament from Nintendo (1:59 - 2:05)
I got it almost a little over a week ago (2:01 - 2:08)
about 10 days ago here pretty much two (2:05 - 2:10)
weeks from the release date of poking (2:08 - 2:12)
tournament which is March 18th if I'm (2:10 - 2:15)
not mistaken the non-disclosure form (2:12 - 2:19)
dates I cannot post anything until nine (2:15 - 2:23)
a-m on March fifteenth which I'm (2:19 - 2:25)
recording this March 14th so by the time (2:23 - 2:27)
you're listening to this it's all good (2:25 - 2:29)
so I'm going to share my thoughts and (2:27 - 2:32)
give you my opinion about poking (2:29 - 2:34)
tournament that's pretty much the gist (2:32 - 2:37)
of this episode I have some notes I have (2:34 - 2:39)
some questions from Twitter I have the (2:37 - 2:41)
roster up I will probably forget some (2:39 - 2:44)
stuff now before I begin assessing my (2:41 - 2:46)
thoughts on poking tournament if you are (2:44 - 2:50)
a hardcore fighting game fan if you go (2:46 - 2:54)
to evo if you're super high amazing rank (2:50 - 2:59)
in street fighter 4 and or five if you (2:54 - 3:03)
play Mortal Kombat ten four hours you're (2:59 - 3:04)
probably not going to like what I have (3:03 - 3:06)
to say (3:04 - 3:10)
cus I'm not good at fighting games never (3:06 - 3:12)
have been probably never will I'm (3:10 - 3:15)
getting too old to be quick enough for (3:12 - 3:17)
anything in life just keep that in mind (3:15 - 3:19)
if you're super hardcore in the fighting (3:17 - 3:21)
games you're gonna have to get somebody (3:19 - 3:23)
else's opinion who is very good at (3:21 - 3:25)
fighting games because i don't think i (3:23 - 3:28)
could speak to that caliber second (3:25 - 3:33)
statement / bullet points i note (3:28 - 3:37)
asterisk thing a little like gift aight (3:33 - 3:41)
is it that no matter if i get something (3:37 - 3:45)
wrong I apologize I again I'm not an (3:41 - 3:47)
expert at fighting games I'm not (3:45 - 3:51)
somebody who reviews things so this is (3:47 - 3:52)
really my opinion and a lot of people (3:51 - 3:53)
want to know if they should buy it (3:52 - 3:56)
especially people who don't like (3:53 - 4:00)
fighting games so let us begin with my (3:56 - 4:03)
thoughts on poking tournament and my art (4:00 - 4:07)
he'll review of poking tournament (4:03 - 4:11)
alright we will start with the initial (4:07 - 4:15)
impressions the game itself is gorgeous (4:11 - 4:17)
it runs on wii u if you haven't figured (4:15 - 4:19)
it out it is a one to two player (4:17 - 4:22)
fighting game there is no minigames (4:19 - 4:25)
there is no 4 player mode it is 122 (4:22 - 4:27)
multiplet 122 player multiplayer (4:25 - 4:31)
fighting game you're single player you (4:27 - 4:34)
converse computers in a story mode or in (4:31 - 4:37)
just single battles which doesn't really (4:34 - 4:39)
do anything mate I mean it could be for (4:37 - 4:41)
practice but there is also a practice (4:39 - 4:45)
mode there is local so you can play with (4:41 - 4:47)
a fright on the couch and I will get to (4:45 - 4:48)
that in a second and then of course (4:47 - 4:50)
there is online play where there is (4:48 - 4:53)
three different types of ranked although (4:50 - 4:54)
I think they're similar in some aspect (4:53 - 4:56)
and i'll get to that too and then there (4:54 - 5:01)
is friendly online play now not knowing (4:56 - 5:03)
anyone personally that has the game i (5:01 - 5:07)
could not test friendly but before i (5:03 - 5:09)
even dive into that i know i'm just like (5:07 - 5:11)
i keep backing up on myself backing up (5:09 - 5:13)
on myself let's talk about the whole (5:11 - 5:17)
menu real quick so we have the fairest (5:13 - 5:20)
league i believe thats there fareham lee (5:17 - 5:21)
sorry my autocorrect corrected it to (5:20 - 5:24)
Ferris fareham league which is your (5:21 - 5:28)
story mode and you have a an assistant (5:24 - 5:32)
or like a coach or what like a friend (5:28 - 5:35)
who is encouraging you to go through (5:32 - 5:37)
this league she has a camera modern (5:35 - 5:39)
dance like Nicole or near something with (5:37 - 5:42)
a net but she has a weavile so she's (5:39 - 5:43)
always like my weave Isles cheering for (5:42 - 5:48)
you Bob so there is that and I only did (5:43 - 5:52)
a bit of the story mode we'd be honest (5:48 - 5:53)
sitting on the couch playing and (5:52 - 5:55)
fighting him by herself against (5:53 - 5:59)
computers gets real old real fast and it (5:55 - 6:02)
was very hard to hold my attention but I (5:59 - 6:04)
went through some of the story you want (6:02 - 6:08)
you unlock through the story mode you (6:04 - 6:12)
probably will eventually unlock mu 2 and (6:08 - 6:14)
shadow Mewtwo those are the only two (6:12 - 6:17)
characters I did not play (6:14 - 6:20)
and I'm assuming one if not both of them (6:17 - 6:22)
are the bosses at the end of the story (6:20 - 6:24)
mode but when you go through story mode (6:22 - 6:27)
you'll be able to unlock new hats or (6:24 - 6:30)
hairstyles or shirts or little title (6:27 - 6:33)
badges I mean it is there's no story to (6:30 - 6:35)
it you're just kind of going through the (6:33 - 6:37)
ranks getting harder and harder (6:35 - 6:40)
opponents I mentioned there a single (6:37 - 6:42)
battle I mentioned there's practice (6:40 - 6:45)
there is also the local battle which is (6:42 - 6:46)
another option and online battle the (6:45 - 6:49)
main thing is called my town which is in (6:46 - 6:51)
the center of this map and that will let (6:49 - 6:54)
you adjust your trainer there's (6:51 - 6:57)
something called titles so a title is (6:54 - 6:59)
something you put under your name so I (6:57 - 7:00)
believe when you start you start with (6:59 - 7:03)
something called newbie trainer and if (7:00 - 7:05)
you win five it matches in a row whether (7:03 - 7:07)
it's computers or real people you unlock (7:05 - 7:10)
a title that says unbeatable trainer you (7:07 - 7:13)
spend a lot of money you or you earn a (7:10 - 7:14)
lot of money I think you get a title of (7:13 - 7:18)
like millionaire there's a ton of titles (7:14 - 7:19)
i want to say there's over 100 there's a (7:18 - 7:22)
there's just a bunch and then you also (7:19 - 7:25)
get a comment setting so that is like a (7:22 - 7:27)
little catchphrase your character says (7:25 - 7:31)
so that could be like good luck or (7:27 - 7:33)
pleased to meet you just something (7:31 - 7:35)
generic and there's a bunch of those two (7:33 - 7:37)
probably about a hundred of those to (7:35 - 7:40)
mine my comment says I'm freezing here (7:37 - 7:42)
because I'm always cold so I thought (7:40 - 7:45)
that was funny oh it was funny to me (7:42 - 7:47)
insert maybe a laugh track or something (7:45 - 7:49)
and then there's your trainer (7:47 - 7:55)
customization so there are you when you (7:49 - 7:56)
set up your trainer you can give him a (7:55 - 8:00)
name him or her name and you can assign (7:56 - 8:03)
skin color and that's about it I think (8:00 - 8:05)
you can assign one other thing but I was (8:03 - 8:07)
at first I was like what I can't adjust (8:05 - 8:09)
my hair or my hair color that's all (8:07 - 8:12)
unlocked so if you want a like black (8:09 - 8:14)
hair in shaggy you have done like that (8:12 - 8:16)
if you want blonde long hair you have (8:14 - 8:18)
done like that if you unlocked black (8:16 - 8:20)
hair shaggy you still have to unlock (8:18 - 8:23)
blonde hair shaggy so there is a lot of (8:20 - 8:25)
unlocks now you can use the money you (8:23 - 8:29)
earn you earn pokey coins or whatever (8:25 - 8:31)
when you complete a battle and story (8:29 - 8:34)
ode you don't earn any in practice or (8:31 - 8:38)
single you do earn an online you don't (8:34 - 8:41)
earn in locals a lot of ways you can (8:38 - 8:44)
earn and a lot of playing where you (8:41 - 8:47)
don't earn anything which okay maybe you (8:44 - 8:48)
come if you want to save up and buy a (8:47 - 8:50)
shirt I mean it only took me like four (8:48 - 8:53)
or five matches to make enough money to (8:50 - 8:54)
buy a shirt and I would say the shirts (8:53 - 8:55)
are a little more expensive than (8:54 - 8:58)
everything else there so trainer (8:55 - 9:01)
customization almost everything there (8:58 - 9:02)
needs to be unlocked whether that's just (9:01 - 9:05)
randomly you will get random unlocks (9:02 - 9:08)
after so you will get random unlocks (9:05 - 9:10)
sometimes when you complete a battle (9:08 - 9:12)
whether you win or lose it says like (9:10 - 9:14)
lucky bonus and then you get the unlock (9:12 - 9:16)
or you can just spend the money for it (9:14 - 9:18)
from what I've noticed in trainer (9:16 - 9:20)
because customization just to run off (9:18 - 9:23)
everything most are unlocks they seem to (9:20 - 9:25)
have 12 different hats they're all just (9:23 - 9:27)
different color hats and that hat seems (9:25 - 9:30)
to be a fedora or furry fedora like (9:27 - 9:33)
there are no beards or moustaches like I (9:30 - 9:35)
said about hair if you want a certain (9:33 - 9:37)
hairstyle there's like eight different (9:35 - 9:38)
colors of a hairstyle that you need to (9:37 - 9:41)
unlock there's like little headsets you (9:38 - 9:44)
can lock there is glasses there's little (9:41 - 9:45)
band-aids that go under your eyes or (9:44 - 9:48)
maybe it's over your nose but those are (9:45 - 9:49)
like the only facial features there's (9:48 - 9:53)
only one feature for freckles there is a (9:49 - 9:56)
couple shirts probably i would say about (9:53 - 9:58)
20 shirts there are three different (9:56 - 10:00)
backgrounds like you could have flames (9:58 - 10:02)
behind your trainer or hearts behind (10:00 - 10:04)
your trainer and I think electricity (10:02 - 10:06)
behind your trainer there's only three (10:04 - 10:09)
of those but you're going to get there (10:06 - 10:12)
that the customization there i don't (10:09 - 10:15)
know about females i didn't try to make (10:12 - 10:19)
a girl at all there's enough customers (10:15 - 10:22)
customization in your character and your (10:19 - 10:25)
title and your comment to definitely (10:22 - 10:27)
stand out i don't know how much again (10:25 - 10:29)
because i'll get to what i've done (10:27 - 10:32)
online let's talk about pokemon there (10:29 - 10:35)
are every pokemon is unlocked except for (10:32 - 10:38)
Mewtwo and shadow Mewtwo of for my (10:35 - 10:40)
understanding you need the card to (10:38 - 10:42)
unlock shadow Mewtwo or they did say if (10:40 - 10:44)
I read correctly you (10:42 - 10:46)
who can unlock him if you go through the (10:44 - 10:48)
whole game that's why I'm assuming he is (10:46 - 10:51)
one of the end bosses oh I played all (10:48 - 10:53)
the characters except those two so let (10:51 - 10:56)
me run down what I've played I'll just (10:53 - 10:58)
run down the characters first Blaziken (10:56 - 11:01)
Brax Ian chandelure Charizard Garchomp (10:58 - 11:05)
guard of war Gengar Lucario Machamp mu (11:01 - 11:08)
tou Pikachu Pikachu Libre which is a (11:05 - 11:10)
girl Pikachu Libre by the way little (11:08 - 11:13)
heart on the tail Sceptile shadow Mewtwo (11:10 - 11:17)
suicune and we've I'll obviously being a (11:13 - 11:20)
big chandelure fan I went with my boyish (11:17 - 11:24)
and allure and Chandler is considered a (11:20 - 11:27)
heavy other heavies would be Garchomp (11:24 - 11:33)
Machamp Charizard and I think that's it (11:27 - 11:36)
Machamp Charizard Garchomp chandelier (11:33 - 11:39)
believe those are all the heavies I (11:36 - 11:42)
would i would say that chandelure (11:39 - 11:46)
and Garchomp are by far some of the (11:42 - 11:49)
slowest Garchomp has a lot of moves that (11:46 - 11:53)
can propel him forward and machamp is (11:49 - 11:56)
also pretty slow he's a little quicker (11:53 - 11:58)
on his feet and movement and he does (11:56 - 11:59)
have a couple moves that propel him (11:58 - 12:02)
forward but Garchomp has just just (11:59 - 12:03)
walking speed i would say that Garchomp (12:02 - 12:07)
and Chandler are the slowest mu2 and (12:03 - 12:11)
charizard seem a little faster just (12:07 - 12:13)
walking that's not like jumping forward (12:11 - 12:15)
or anything now again I want to (12:13 - 12:18)
preference that I could be mistaken I (12:15 - 12:20)
did play all of them i didn't i didn't (12:18 - 12:22)
set up a timer at in time and i'm just (12:20 - 12:25)
going off of i played almost every (12:22 - 12:28)
character three to four matches in (12:25 - 12:32)
computers and local and some online so i (12:28 - 12:34)
was really trying to get a feel of (12:32 - 12:36)
everything (12:34 - 12:38)
with that being said I do like (12:36 - 12:41)
Chandelure the chandeleur while being (12:38 - 12:45)
slow has a lot of ranged attacks I feel (12:41 - 12:50)
like Chandler has not good HP compared (12:45 - 12:51)
to others and now that's a big thing (12:50 - 12:54)
that I want to touch on all Pokemon have (12:51 - 12:57)
different HP levels something like a (12:54 - 13:00)
Pikachu or a Pikachu Libre or a weavile (12:57 - 13:03)
will not have as much HP as a machamp or (13:00 - 13:06)
a Charizard with that being said (13:03 - 13:10)
everyone's burst attack which is like (13:06 - 13:13)
they're super all the births attacks do (13:10 - 13:16)
different damage and from from what I (13:13 - 13:18)
was playing because I I did play with (13:16 - 13:19)
everyone I did try to land everyone I (13:18 - 13:22)
did successful and everyone's burst I (13:19 - 13:24)
did try to calculate numbers gangers (13:22 - 13:27)
seems to have the most powerful burst at (13:24 - 13:30)
doing almost fifty percent damage on hit (13:27 - 13:33)
with that being said Pokemon earn their (13:30 - 13:36)
burst at different times so Pikachu (13:33 - 13:40)
Libre will earn its burst a lot faster (13:36 - 13:44)
than like a pokemon like Chandelure and (13:40 - 13:46)
that again has to do on how well you're (13:44 - 13:48)
doing the match if you're picking up the (13:46 - 13:52)
burst things on the field okay so let me (13:48 - 13:54)
just run down the line Blaziken Blaziken (13:52 - 13:56)
is a real weird Pokemon he's like a (13:54 - 13:59)
giant chicken I think we all know that I (13:56 - 14:03)
actually like playing as Blaziken he's (13:59 - 14:06)
pretty quick he's I believe he's a (14:03 - 14:09)
normal normal so you have normal (14:06 - 14:12)
technical power and speed those are how (14:09 - 14:15)
your Pokemon break down before you pick (14:12 - 14:18)
them Blaziken very good average very (14:15 - 14:21)
good starting place does a lot of kicks (14:18 - 14:23)
that's pretty much the the primary thing (14:21 - 14:26)
that blazing and does pretty quick a (14:23 - 14:29)
couple moves that propel him forward all (14:26 - 14:32)
around you know not not low HP not high (14:29 - 14:35)
HP hits pretty decently blaziken's a (14:32 - 14:38)
good choice moving on to brac seein (14:35 - 14:42)
break braixen braixen didn't like I (14:38 - 14:44)
thought I was going to like so this is (14:42 - 14:46)
actually a female Pokemon there's just (14:44 - 14:48)
it's just noticeable and I like that (14:46 - 14:50)
Pokemon company did go I (14:48 - 14:53)
Pikachu Libre and breaks in our female (14:50 - 14:55)
Chandler might be female 2 it's just (14:53 - 14:58)
hard to tell the gender preference of a (14:55 - 15:02)
ghost bandolier um I didn't like breaks (14:58 - 15:05)
in I did battle breaks in it online and (15:02 - 15:07)
it has a lot of ranged attacks a lot of (15:05 - 15:10)
fireballs a lot of fire bursts and it (15:07 - 15:13)
was good it also rides on his broomstick (15:10 - 15:16)
but I just wasn't a fan I felt like he (15:13 - 15:17)
didn't hit hard enough I felt like it (15:16 - 15:20)
was it is considered believe an average (15:17 - 15:24)
Pokemon just didn't feel good to me and (15:20 - 15:25)
I played it a couple times and I just (15:24 - 15:27)
didn't enjoy it going on the Chandeleur (15:25 - 15:29)
shamblers probably when I played the (15:27 - 15:31)
most but not the one I like the most I (15:29 - 15:34)
really tried to get down its moves and (15:31 - 15:38)
it has a giant I don't I should have the (15:34 - 15:40)
move list actually tells you which (15:38 - 15:42)
Pokemon moves there are like night / or (15:40 - 15:46)
sucker punch or low kick your (15:42 - 15:50)
Thunderbolt or you get it Chandler (15:46 - 15:52)
shoots out a giant beam and it's it's (15:50 - 15:56)
very similar to suicune has a giant beam (15:52 - 15:58)
and Mewtwo has a giant beam they'll send (15:56 - 16:03)
out and if you time it right you can (15:58 - 16:05)
kind of spam it over and over so like if (16:03 - 16:07)
you time it right when they get up you (16:05 - 16:08)
can beam them again if they're not quick (16:07 - 16:10)
enough to block which is a little again (16:08 - 16:13)
I'm not good at the game so maybe I'm (16:10 - 16:15)
just bad and I get hit by it every time (16:13 - 16:17)
but it is like then like in all fighting (16:15 - 16:18)
games I feel like you're like in Street (16:17 - 16:20)
Fighter you can spam a fireball over and (16:18 - 16:24)
over and and whatnot Charizard I feel (16:20 - 16:27)
secretly feel like Charizard on balance (16:24 - 16:29)
I feel like Charizard now charizard is a (16:27 - 16:30)
power Pokemon I feel like it has a lot (16:29 - 16:33)
of health and it hits really hard and it (16:30 - 16:37)
has really I I just feel like it's is (16:33 - 16:40)
unbalanced just because it's Charizard (16:37 - 16:42)
but with that being said Charizard has a (16:40 - 16:44)
lot of cool moves its burst turns it (16:42 - 16:46)
into mega Charizard and it's a giant (16:44 - 16:51)
Fire Blast I was indifferent if I was to (16:46 - 16:52)
pick up our pokemon I'll get to the one (16:51 - 16:56)
I like the most Garchomp I'm not a big (16:52 - 16:57)
Garchomp fan I know a lot of people like (16:56 - 16:59)
Garchomp Garchomp has a lot of like i (16:57 - 17:01)
said earlier allah moves that propel (16:59 - 17:04)
Garchomp forward which makes up for how (17:01 - 17:07)
slow it is on its feet Garchomp can also (17:04 - 17:10)
dig and i also like no sand attack which (17:07 - 17:11)
is ironically super funny because i was (17:10 - 17:14)
a very old it's super effective joke but (17:11 - 17:17)
it's the Garchomp it is what you expect (17:14 - 17:19)
Garchomp to be but Gardevoir was (17:17 - 17:21)
probably one the one I played the least (17:19 - 17:24)
I had the same feel of Gardevoir like i (17:21 - 17:27)
did with brac braixen braixen I just (17:24 - 17:29)
didn't like it girl it felt very floaty (17:27 - 17:34)
a lot of the moves seemed not close up (17:29 - 17:36)
but not far away it's almost like you (17:34 - 17:39)
had to be in a sweet spot of which kind (17:36 - 17:40)
of makes sense for how it played but (17:39 - 17:43)
yeah very floating to me kind of slow (17:40 - 17:46)
for being at the leave Gardevoir was is (17:43 - 17:49)
a technical fighter so yeah I wasn't I (17:46 - 17:51)
just wasn't a fan moving on to gengar I (17:49 - 17:53)
think gengar probably one of the Pokemon (17:51 - 17:55)
you've seen the most online of people (17:53 - 17:58)
using gengar is considered a technical (17:55 - 17:59)
fighter it does have a lot of (17:58 - 18:02)
teleportation so ganger can teleport (17:59 - 18:03)
quickly (18:02 - 18:04)
find you a lot of its moves like (18:03 - 18:07)
teleport like there's like shadow sneak (18:04 - 18:08)
or sucker punch that just kind of show (18:07 - 18:10)
up behind you and punch in the back of (18:08 - 18:12)
the head gang guard for my from my (18:10 - 18:16)
playing has the best burst of sucking (18:12 - 18:18)
you into a giant gengar mouth and it (18:16 - 18:20)
looks awesome and terrifying at the same (18:18 - 18:23)
time that being said I thought I'd like (18:20 - 18:24)
anger a lot and I just didn't really get (18:23 - 18:27)
into a gengar was for being a technical (18:24 - 18:29)
fighter I felt like he was kind of (18:27 - 18:31)
sluggish now moving around the arena (18:29 - 18:35)
felt fine felt normal but it almost felt (18:31 - 18:38)
like Halen when I say it felt fine felt (18:35 - 18:41)
normal felt faster than most power (18:38 - 18:44)
characters but also still had a little (18:41 - 18:47)
sluggishness to him like obviously gang (18:44 - 18:48)
are could teleport really quickly to (18:47 - 18:51)
move him around the arena quicker than (18:48 - 18:53)
anyone but when you're not doing that (18:51 - 18:57)
it's almost like you feel like a slug (18:53 - 19:00)
Lucario you guys all know I don't like (18:57 - 19:02)
Lucario he panders to a certain audience (19:00 - 19:07)
which is if you like Lucario fine he has (19:02 - 19:10)
a nice blue fur I'll give you that in (19:07 - 19:14)
poking tournament he to me feels the (19:10 - 19:18)
same void as Blaziken in similarity is (19:14 - 19:22)
very good for a starting player not not (19:18 - 19:25)
too slow not too fast not too weak not (19:22 - 19:29)
too strong very average if I was to pick (19:25 - 19:32)
one of those two I just like blaziken's (19:29 - 19:34)
moveset a lot better I just like how the (19:32 - 19:37)
combos flow and I'll get to how combos (19:34 - 19:41)
flow surprise hit to me and my actual (19:37 - 19:43)
favorite was Machamp for the actually (19:41 - 19:45)
the first four to five hours Machamp was (19:43 - 19:49)
the only pokemon I didn't play and when (19:45 - 19:51)
I finally played it I like Machamp a lot (19:49 - 19:53)
a lot a lot a lot now I'm a champ is a (19:51 - 19:59)
power character and he every Pokemon has (19:53 - 20:03)
the same grab tight move now how it gets (19:59 - 20:05)
executors of course up to that poke (20:03 - 20:06)
button and how much damage it does (20:05 - 20:09)
depends on the pokemon but I believe I'm (20:06 - 20:11)
trying to think of the controller it's B (20:09 - 20:13)
and X so if you press B and X at the (20:11 - 20:15)
same time you grab your opponent and (20:13 - 20:17)
that is the most successful (20:15 - 20:19)
when your opponent is blocking with the (20:17 - 20:21)
shield if your opponent has a shield up (20:19 - 20:23)
and you do a grab you will automatically (20:21 - 20:26)
successfully land that grab all those (20:23 - 20:28)
pokemon have that Machamp though has (20:26 - 20:31)
another grab i believe it's double-a and (20:28 - 20:34)
machamp will do a sprint I say spurn (20:31 - 20:35)
it's not that fast but he will sprint (20:34 - 20:38)
towards the Pokemon and grab it and do a (20:35 - 20:41)
different grab from my playing through (20:38 - 20:43)
all these Pokemon without Mewtwo and (20:41 - 20:44)
shadow Mewtwo Machamp is the only (20:43 - 20:50)
pokemon with multiple grabs besides the (20:44 - 20:53)
standard xB grab like I said double (20:50 - 20:56)
tapping a in the direction of your (20:53 - 20:59)
opponent will force my champ to do a run (20:56 - 21:01)
and a different type of graph which does (20:59 - 21:03)
a lot of damage if you can land it I (21:01 - 21:06)
like my champ a lot I think his moves (21:03 - 21:08)
that's really cool again a lot of grabs (21:06 - 21:11)
he also (21:08 - 21:12)
to me feels like one of the quicker (21:11 - 21:15)
heavies on top of that he does a lot of (21:12 - 21:17)
damage and he has a lot of health the (21:15 - 21:19)
biggest disadvantage though and I ran (21:17 - 21:21)
and ran into this online against (21:19 - 21:25)
sceptile and breaks ian is Machamp (21:21 - 21:27)
almost gets destroyed by anything with (21:25 - 21:29)
good range if you can keep Machamp away (21:27 - 21:33)
it's very hard for Machamp that closed (21:29 - 21:36)
that distance because of his speed and (21:33 - 21:38)
because of his moveset now he does have (21:36 - 21:40)
a couple moves that propel forward but (21:38 - 21:44)
not enough to avoid constant fireballs (21:40 - 21:47)
I'm and I've said this before probably (21:44 - 21:48)
not the best player so I don't know how (21:47 - 21:51)
to counter it but it was frustrating if (21:48 - 21:53)
you are playing against somebody who is (21:51 - 21:56)
aggressive somebody who just jumps in (21:53 - 21:59)
somebody who doesn't really black Oh (21:56 - 22:02)
machamp is killer so killer in his (21:59 - 22:05)
moveset in his counters in his grabs um (22:02 - 22:09)
I like him a lot but against somebody (22:05 - 22:11)
with a range attack I feel like that's (22:09 - 22:13)
where Machamp falls apart and that makes (22:11 - 22:15)
sense also Machamp having multiple (22:13 - 22:18)
throws makes sense he has forearms he (22:15 - 22:21)
also does a sweet dropkick if if you (22:18 - 22:24)
pull off a combo right mewtwo I didn't (22:21 - 22:26)
play I played against somebody with him (22:24 - 22:29)
you too and like i said earlier has a (22:26 - 22:33)
very long range beam attack um and i got (22:29 - 22:35)
destroyed by me too I feel like maybe me (22:33 - 22:37)
too has the charger treatment now this (22:35 - 22:39)
is could all be my head but Mewtwo maybe (22:37 - 22:42)
has a little too strong a little too (22:39 - 22:45)
much health little too quick I haven't (22:42 - 22:46)
played me too though so i can't speak on (22:45 - 22:49)
that Pikachu and Pikachu Libre I'll (22:46 - 22:50)
throw them both together they are (22:49 - 22:53)
considered speed Pokemon they do have (22:50 - 22:55)
different moves and different burst but (22:53 - 22:58)
some other moves are slightly similar (22:55 - 23:00)
it's Pikachu he can do with Thunderbolts (22:58 - 23:02)
he can do a quick attack he can do a (23:00 - 23:05)
double team I can't remember Pikachu's (23:02 - 23:07)
burst I think he just turns into a giant (23:05 - 23:10)
Thunderball no he does this weird like (23:07 - 23:12)
uppercut punch to you he punches you (23:10 - 23:15)
with his electric fist which is really (23:12 - 23:16)
weird Pikachu Libre has a really cool (23:15 - 23:18)
burst he throws you into a wrestling (23:16 - 23:20)
ring and stands on the corner and like (23:18 - 23:23)
does a body slam off it's real cool I (23:20 - 23:25)
didn't like Pikachu (23:23 - 23:26)
a war Pikachu Libre they don't have as (23:25 - 23:28)
much health as the other Pokemon they (23:26 - 23:30)
are extremely fast but they don't hit (23:28 - 23:32)
very hard which probably why they fall (23:30 - 23:34)
under the speed character Sceptile i (23:32 - 23:36)
can't i'm pretty sure subtitles a (23:34 - 23:37)
technical fighter has a lot of range (23:36 - 23:41)
attacks Sceptile from my playthrough is (23:37 - 23:42)
the only pokemon that can get health (23:41 - 23:46)
back with a Giga Drain and leech seed I (23:42 - 23:48)
think the two moves are so to touch on (23:46 - 23:51)
playing online I played five matches (23:48 - 23:52)
before I recorded this online because (23:51 - 23:54)
when i try to do online the other night (23:52 - 23:56)
I didn't get matched with anyone I got (23:54 - 23:59)
matched up with shady penguin twice both (23:56 - 24:01)
using sceptile and i was using Machamp (23:59 - 24:05)
and because of sept-iles ranged attacks (24:01 - 24:08)
i couldn't really get close enough now I (24:05 - 24:11)
did win one round um because once you (24:08 - 24:12)
kind of breakthrough and you get up (24:11 - 24:14)
there close to the champ you can do some (24:12 - 24:17)
damage as long as you keep that distance (24:14 - 24:19)
a minimum but it's very hard to at least (24:17 - 24:22)
I had a problem trying to close that (24:19 - 24:24)
distance initially and like I said (24:22 - 24:27)
sceptile does get health back depending (24:24 - 24:30)
on certain moves it does that being said (24:27 - 24:31)
when i played sceptile i just wasn't (24:30 - 24:34)
very good at it and I yeah I date (24:31 - 24:36)
sept-iles like a crit he's a lame (24:34 - 24:38)
Christmas tree Allen I don't know like (24:36 - 24:40)
them shadow me too i didn't plays sweet (24:38 - 24:46)
kun feels awkward maybe cuz it's one of (24:40 - 24:49)
the few pokemon and like four legs it's (24:46 - 24:51)
fine i feel like a lot of his moves are (24:49 - 24:53)
very similar to Schindler it has a lot (24:51 - 24:57)
of it has that giant ice beam which is (24:53 - 24:59)
very similar to channelers beam it has a (24:57 - 25:02)
an aurora beam which is similar to a (24:59 - 25:04)
different move that Chandler does it (25:02 - 25:07)
shoots out like ice like icy wind which (25:04 - 25:10)
is similar to Chandlers little flayers (25:07 - 25:13)
that it sends out it has a lot of (25:10 - 25:15)
similar like they are different but they (25:13 - 25:19)
are very similar suicune a bit faster i (25:15 - 25:21)
think suicune is also a technical (25:19 - 25:23)
fighter I didn't play suicune a lot (25:21 - 25:25)
compared to the other ones it was it was (25:23 - 25:27)
fine I heard that suicune is the broken (25:25 - 25:29)
Pokemon in the game and what I mean by (25:27 - 25:33)
that is that it is for people who are (25:29 - 25:35)
serious or competitive they are focusing (25:33 - 25:38)
on suicune I didn't see why (25:35 - 25:41)
I've never watched good people use (25:38 - 25:43)
suicune but when I was playing against (25:41 - 25:46)
it it just it has a lot of beams and it (25:43 - 25:48)
has a lot of distance move so maybe (25:46 - 25:51)
that's why and the last pokemon which (25:48 - 25:54)
was my favorite until machamp is weavile (25:51 - 25:58)
weavile has one of the best moves in the (25:54 - 26:02)
game I'm not joking the combo is mash (25:58 - 26:04)
why repeatedly actually about five times (26:02 - 26:10)
it does just a / / / a different / a (26:04 - 26:13)
different / and then a big / and you can (26:10 - 26:16)
do that pretty easily by mashing lie and (26:13 - 26:18)
I'll get to the move sent in a different (26:16 - 26:20)
we vials considered speed poke money's (26:18 - 26:22)
very fast he doesn't do a lot of damage (26:20 - 26:24)
his burst attack does about twenty-five (26:22 - 26:27)
percent of your opponent's health and in (26:24 - 26:30)
retrospect gang gars does about 50 other (26:27 - 26:33)
Pokemon range between 30 and 40 so I (26:30 - 26:35)
would say that we vials is on the lower (26:33 - 26:37)
end I'm sure there's gonna be like a (26:35 - 26:40)
YouTube video like next week of exactly (26:37 - 26:41)
how much damage everything does and you (26:40 - 26:43)
guys can tell me I'm wrong but whatever (26:41 - 26:46)
I like we buy a lot he's very fast if I (26:43 - 26:48)
was to pick any speed Pokemon it'd be (26:46 - 26:50)
weavile I just like its moves better (26:48 - 26:53)
than Pikachu's I he can close the (26:50 - 26:55)
distance really fast he has like night / (26:53 - 26:58)
and like a quick attack and he's a cool (26:55 - 27:01)
pokemon very cool one of my favorites it (26:58 - 27:02)
would be a toss-up between Machamp and (27:01 - 27:04)
weavile and then I would probably just (27:02 - 27:06)
do Chandler just because I like shandler (27:04 - 27:08)
so much but like i said i really like (27:06 - 27:11)
Blaziken a lot too I would love to spend (27:08 - 27:13)
more time with other Pokemon I just (27:11 - 27:15)
haven't I haven't had enough time to (27:13 - 27:17)
spend with everything I was trying to (27:15 - 27:20)
get everything for you guys alright so (27:17 - 27:24)
movesets how does the game play you ask (27:20 - 27:29)
it plays so if i do the spectrum of (27:24 - 27:31)
Fighters let's just say the most (27:29 - 27:33)
hardcore fighter (27:31 - 27:35)
i could say right now would be street (27:33 - 27:38)
fighter four or five just pick one (27:35 - 27:40)
street fighter and i would say one of (27:38 - 27:43)
the most i'm gonna get a lot heat for (27:40 - 27:45)
this a lot of hate one of the moat on (27:43 - 27:47)
the other end of the spectrum i would (27:45 - 27:48)
say super smash brothers is at the (27:47 - 27:51)
bottom end and why i say that is because (27:48 - 27:56)
smash brothers moveset is very simple a (27:51 - 28:02)
whole day four day down a up a repeat (27:56 - 28:06)
that with be down be up be hold B (28:02 - 28:09)
whereas street fighter is a lot of (28:06 - 28:12)
memorization of combos quarter circle a (28:09 - 28:16)
quarter circle back be i'm not i'm not (28:12 - 28:19)
trying to do a disservice to smash (28:16 - 28:22)
brothers although i don't consider smash (28:19 - 28:24)
brothers are real fighting game but i (28:22 - 28:27)
would just say that memorizing its moves (28:24 - 28:31)
are very simple street fighter you have (28:27 - 28:33)
to put a lot of time'n i would say pokin (28:31 - 28:36)
is way closer to smash brothers and (28:33 - 28:40)
moves when i said earlier that one of we (28:36 - 28:43)
vials moves in the move list says (28:40 - 28:47)
repeatedly tap why I was not joking that (28:43 - 28:50)
is what it says I think the most (28:47 - 28:54)
complicated move i saw was bored B comma (28:50 - 28:58)
B its moves are very simple when you're (28:54 - 29:01)
in the modes now there's two foot (28:58 - 29:03)
there's two I can't remember what (29:01 - 29:06)
they're called there is the when you're (29:03 - 29:09)
fighting and poking you are started in a (29:06 - 29:11)
3d environment and your moves are (29:09 - 29:14)
slightly different compared to a 2d (29:11 - 29:16)
environment and the way it's which is (29:14 - 29:19)
just how you hit and interact with the (29:16 - 29:22)
other pokemon I'm sure there is a more (29:19 - 29:25)
exact science to that but the moves you (29:22 - 29:28)
do in 3d are different than the ones you (29:25 - 29:30)
do in 2d so there is memorization of (29:28 - 29:33)
okay I can do this move but now if I'm (29:30 - 29:35)
in 2d I can't but with that being said (29:33 - 29:40)
when most of the moves are Ford a mash (29:35 - 29:43)
why repeatedly hold x and y at the same (29:40 - 29:45)
time hold X and be at the same time like (29:43 - 29:47)
that is the extent of your moves (29:45 - 29:49)
getting more into the burst moves where (29:47 - 29:51)
you do your finisher or your super or (29:49 - 29:52)
whatever you want to call it you're (29:51 - 29:55)
going to press l r2 activate that and (29:52 - 29:57)
then you're on a time limit and your (29:55 - 29:59)
moves are you move faster your moves are (29:57 - 30:01)
more powerful but to actually activate (29:59 - 30:03)
your super again because you go into (30:01 - 30:05)
burst mode and then to actually activate (30:03 - 30:07)
your burst you all you do is head L&R (30:05 - 30:09)
again and you hopefully connect if (30:07 - 30:11)
they're blocking they block it but (30:09 - 30:14)
that's that's the extent i know in (30:11 - 30:17)
mortal combat it's a little more (30:14 - 30:19)
difficult to pull off your finisher you (30:17 - 30:21)
have to memorize a couple more buttons (30:19 - 30:23)
than just ellen are at the same time so (30:21 - 30:26)
i could probably go on but right now (30:23 - 30:30)
this is what i will say if I'm gonna get (30:26 - 30:31)
this out the way you're listening to (30:30 - 30:33)
this podcast because you like Pokemon (30:31 - 30:36)
clearly we are Pokemon base podcast so (30:33 - 30:38)
if you're listening we already have that (30:36 - 30:39)
other way I already know you like (30:38 - 30:42)
Pokemon you've made it 30 minutes in so (30:39 - 30:45)
because you like Pokemon the question is (30:42 - 30:49)
should you buy poke in this Friday March (30:45 - 30:53)
18th when it comes out if you like smash (30:49 - 30:56)
brothers heck if you if you love smash (30:53 - 30:58)
brothers but if he even if you like (30:56 - 31:00)
smash brothers and you're listening to (30:58 - 31:02)
this podcast which tells me you like (31:00 - 31:04)
pokemon then yes you should absolutely a (31:02 - 31:08)
poke in even if you're a casual smash (31:04 - 31:11)
brothers fan that would be my answer if (31:08 - 31:13)
you do not like smash brothers that (31:11 - 31:16)
tells me that you probably don't really (31:13 - 31:18)
like fighting games then my answer is no (31:16 - 31:20)
don't get pokin it's not going to (31:18 - 31:22)
convince you to like a fighting game at (31:20 - 31:25)
the end of the day it is a two-player (31:22 - 31:27)
fighting game whether you're going to (31:25 - 31:28)
play online or you're going to play (31:27 - 31:30)
against a computer or you're going to (31:28 - 31:31)
play with somebody on your couch and (31:30 - 31:34)
there is dis advantages to playing with (31:31 - 31:35)
somebody on your couch and I will get to (31:34 - 31:39)
that but that that that is the best (31:35 - 31:41)
review I could possibly give do you like (31:39 - 31:44)
smash brothers yes or no do you like (31:41 - 31:46)
Pokemon obviously you're listening to (31:44 - 31:48)
the show if you like smash brothers you (31:46 - 31:50)
should go out and buy pokin no matter (31:48 - 31:53)
what it will be to your standards I (31:50 - 31:57)
believe it is a more of a fighting game (31:53 - 32:00)
than puck and smash brothers is (31:57 - 32:02)
gets made from that but that would be my (32:00 - 32:05)
that would be my review so take that (32:02 - 32:10)
make your decisions now but I have about (32:05 - 32:13)
eight Twitter questions to get to let me (32:10 - 32:15)
talk about online real quick I played (32:13 - 32:17)
five matches tonight before I got on (32:15 - 32:19)
line the other night I tried to connect (32:17 - 32:21)
I waited I don't know four or five (32:19 - 32:23)
minutes and it couldn't find me a single (32:21 - 32:24)
match so what happens when you connect (32:23 - 32:27)
on line is you get a 10 second timer and (32:24 - 32:30)
if the game cannot find an opponent (32:27 - 32:32)
within 10 seconds it will match you (32:30 - 32:35)
against a computer and what kind of (32:32 - 32:37)
sucks is you can beat that computer or (32:35 - 32:40)
not get any fight money your rewards for (32:37 - 32:43)
doing so but once the game finds an (32:40 - 32:45)
opponent it will interrupt you and pull (32:43 - 32:46)
you out of your computer match to match (32:45 - 32:48)
with that opponent so I played five (32:46 - 32:51)
matches online i won one of them I lost (32:48 - 32:55)
for two were against shady penguin the (32:51 - 32:58)
longest I went was to full CPU matches (32:55 - 33:00)
before I was partnered with somebody (32:58 - 33:03)
again I did play another guy back to (33:00 - 33:05)
back twice he actually had a bracket and (33:03 - 33:07)
lost him the first time and beat him the (33:05 - 33:10)
second time um very tough with machan (33:07 - 33:13)
Braxton has a lot of distance keeping me (33:10 - 33:18)
away fire moves so yeah it was this is (33:13 - 33:21)
where I get critical the online play was (33:18 - 33:26)
atrocious it was so bad leg wise and I (33:21 - 33:30)
didn't mean I don't mean like leggy as (33:26 - 33:35)
in skipping frames the game would just (33:30 - 33:38)
stop completely and like a full second (33:35 - 33:40)
would go through and then it would pick (33:38 - 33:43)
up where it left off it was frustrating (33:40 - 33:47)
and I mean I can I can't blame it on the (33:43 - 33:49)
servers being slammed because there (33:47 - 33:50)
aren't that many people playing that's (33:49 - 33:52)
why i keep getting matched with the same (33:50 - 33:54)
people which is also frustrating when (33:52 - 33:56)
you go in in your record is 00 and you (33:54 - 33:58)
get matched with somebody with eighty (33:56 - 34:02)
six matches 60 of them being wins you're (33:58 - 34:04)
just kind of like well i'm probably (34:02 - 34:07)
gonna lose which happened to me four (34:04 - 34:11)
times actually ah but yeah all games (34:07 - 34:14)
were extremely laggy except for one (34:11 - 34:16)
and even in that one there was still (34:14 - 34:17)
legs so I don't know if they're gonna (34:16 - 34:22)
fix that but um not fun in a fighting (34:17 - 34:25)
game with leg otherwise what else do I (34:22 - 34:27)
have here so oh yeah online battle there (34:25 - 34:29)
are four different modes that are ranked (34:27 - 34:31)
match there's friendly match theirs (34:29 - 34:33)
point ranking and there is win ranking (34:31 - 34:36)
so for my understanding I didn't go into (34:33 - 34:38)
all of these i did a ranked match and I (34:36 - 34:41)
believe ranked match is supposed to pair (34:38 - 34:42)
you with somebody against a ranked of (34:41 - 34:44)
course me being 00 right away they (34:42 - 34:48)
paired me with somebody who was 5630 (34:44 - 34:51)
friendly match it does keep records of (34:48 - 34:54)
that but I don't know if it shows that (34:51 - 34:58)
ahead of time point ranking is when you (34:54 - 35:01)
win a match only 11 you get a certain (34:58 - 35:03)
amount of points I'm assuming when you (35:01 - 35:05)
lose you also lose those points so I (35:03 - 35:07)
would my guess would be that it would (35:05 - 35:10)
rent it would match you with opponents (35:07 - 35:12)
based on the point and then win ranking (35:10 - 35:14)
I'm assuming it matches based on wins (35:12 - 35:18)
because points your viewpoints in your (35:14 - 35:21)
your winds could be a different number (35:18 - 35:23)
and rank i would assume would be all of (35:21 - 35:26)
that combined the other things just to (35:23 - 35:28)
touch on real quick before we can't (35:26 - 35:30)
imagine i've been talking this long (35:28 - 35:33)
hopefully you guys like it is when (35:30 - 35:34)
you're going through story mode and when (35:33 - 35:35)
you're going through just online battles (35:34 - 35:38)
you level up your pokemon i don't know (35:35 - 35:40)
what the max level is I got Chandler up (35:38 - 35:41)
to eight and we'll ask you to assign (35:40 - 35:45)
points into power defense your assists (35:41 - 35:49)
and then your burst and you can reassign (35:45 - 35:51)
those at any time if you go back to my (35:49 - 35:54)
town and then you go into your character (35:51 - 35:57)
you can you know you can put everything (35:54 - 35:58)
in the power you can put everything into (35:57 - 36:01)
defense mix and match I don't know how (35:58 - 36:05)
that actually translates into online or (36:01 - 36:07)
local over that store I don't know how (36:05 - 36:08)
that works I don't know if a chandelier (36:07 - 36:11)
with no base stats would be easily (36:08 - 36:13)
outmatched by Chandelure with a bunch of (36:11 - 36:16)
points into like power defense I don't (36:13 - 36:18)
know I haven't played the game long (36:16 - 36:20)
enough I haven't seen I not sitting (36:18 - 36:21)
there with a notepad writing down (36:20 - 36:23)
numbers I just don't know as four (36:21 - 36:26)
assists characters you start with three (36:23 - 36:28)
sets you start with sniping (36:26 - 36:30)
mattress a Mogan fennigan and frogadier (36:28 - 36:33)
and EV as you play through the match (36:30 - 36:36)
your assist fills up you can hit l1 to (36:33 - 36:37)
bring it bring it out and then it does (36:36 - 36:40)
something for example snivy chases after (36:37 - 36:42)
them and does a leaf storm Lapras does a (36:40 - 36:46)
surf over them a moga will reduce their (36:42 - 36:48)
speed and their defense I believe (36:46 - 36:51)
fennekin is more of like a defensive (36:48 - 36:53)
attack so if you need to get somebody (36:51 - 36:55)
away from you that's where fennekin (36:53 - 36:56)
would be better than like a sniper a (36:55 - 36:59)
Lapras what Lapras pushes away too (36:56 - 37:02)
frogadier has like a ranged attack and (36:59 - 37:04)
Evie restores your health I haven't (37:02 - 37:05)
unlocked the other ones I saw other (37:04 - 37:07)
people did like I saw somebody use a (37:05 - 37:09)
cube own against me and they used it (37:07 - 37:12)
twice in the same round that match round (37:09 - 37:15)
and so obviously I would assume cubone (37:12 - 37:20)
regens its assist a lot faster because (37:15 - 37:24)
it was crazy fast and I'm assuming you (37:20 - 37:26)
unlock those through story because I (37:24 - 37:27)
played a lot of stuff that wasn't story (37:26 - 37:30)
and I didn't unlock any so I was (37:27 - 37:31)
disappointed that I did not unlock (37:30 - 37:34)
farfetch and electrode yet I feel like (37:31 - 37:37)
that would might be my dream combo all (37:34 - 37:38)
right let's get to some Twitter (37:37 - 37:41)
questions real quick see what we got (37:38 - 37:45)
here so wrong song hugs on Twitter (37:41 - 37:48)
impressions of online as well as other (37:45 - 37:50)
fighters is offensive focused or is it (37:48 - 37:54)
blocking / countering better so there is (37:50 - 37:57)
a rock-paper-scissors mechanic to the (37:54 - 38:01)
game if somebody is blocking a grab will (37:57 - 38:04)
break that if somebody is grabbing a (38:01 - 38:08)
counter will break that and if somebody (38:04 - 38:15)
is just attacking that will break a (38:08 - 38:17)
counter i sorry i don't have the (38:15 - 38:19)
triangle in front of me but pretty much (38:17 - 38:21)
if somebody puts up a shield and they're (38:19 - 38:22)
not letting down you grab them you're (38:21 - 38:24)
instantly going to break that shield and (38:22 - 38:26)
you're going to go through somebody puts (38:24 - 38:27)
up a shield and you counter it's not (38:26 - 38:28)
going to do anything because their (38:27 - 38:31)
shields up if somebody counters and the (38:28 - 38:34)
new counter second their counter is (38:31 - 38:36)
going to get absorbed into yours and (38:34 - 38:38)
you're going to counter back and all (38:36 - 38:40)
pokemon have same counter buttons I (38:38 - 38:41)
think it's (38:40 - 38:43)
XNA and all poke might have the same (38:41 - 38:48)
grab buttons which is B and why I'm (38:43 - 38:49)
trying to think of the controller (38:48 - 38:51)
they're all the same for all the pokemon (38:49 - 38:54)
so that's nice but you have so if (38:51 - 38:57)
somebody's non stop attacking you you (38:54 - 38:58)
would want to break it with a counter (38:57 - 39:01)
and if somebody's trying to counter your (38:58 - 39:05)
counter kind of counter you you counted (39:01 - 39:08)
them there's a hierarchy there but it (39:05 - 39:12)
all makes sense it's very if somebody is (39:08 - 39:15)
not defensive you want to stay if (39:12 - 39:17)
somebody's not using their she a lot if (39:15 - 39:18)
they're not defense if you want to stay (39:17 - 39:21)
away from grabs because they're going to (39:18 - 39:23)
break through your grab pretty much (39:21 - 39:27)
every time if somebody is very defensive (39:23 - 39:29)
you want to use more grabs because (39:27 - 39:30)
you're just going to have the advantage (39:29 - 39:34)
of breaking that defense the shield the (39:30 - 39:39)
protect is kind of similar to how it (39:34 - 39:42)
works in Smash Brothers where it can (39:39 - 39:44)
eventually be broken the differences in (39:42 - 39:46)
Smash Brothers it kind of dwindles now (39:44 - 39:47)
and it gets like that bubble gets (39:46 - 39:51)
smaller in pokin it you can keep it up (39:47 - 39:53)
as long as you want but it will (39:51 - 39:57)
eventually break if you attack it enough (39:53 - 39:59)
and you do have to attack it a lot to (39:57 - 40:02)
break it in all the games I played (39:59 - 40:04)
somebody only broke my shield my protect (40:02 - 40:06)
probably twice and that was just because (40:04 - 40:08)
I was over protecting because I didn't (40:06 - 40:11)
know how to close the distance so yeah (40:08 - 40:15)
great question Logan rights tweets in (40:11 - 40:17)
tweets in you've mentioned all the pokes (40:15 - 40:19)
seem different with fighting style can (40:17 - 40:21)
you go into some difference more I think (40:19 - 40:25)
I did that earlier but yeah the unique (40:21 - 40:26)
ones that kind of stand out i think (40:25 - 40:28)
char's arts pretty unique Garchomp (40:26 - 40:31)
Gardevoir is unique Pikachu and Pikachu (40:28 - 40:33)
Libre pretty similar sept-iles (40:31 - 40:36)
definitely unique suicune and chandelier (40:33 - 40:39)
seem very similar to me Lucario Blaziken (40:36 - 40:42)
seemed very similar to me Gengar is (40:39 - 40:45)
pretty unique they all are pretty (40:42 - 40:49)
different except how to like execute (40:45 - 40:50)
their moves are all pretty much the same (40:49 - 40:51)
it's probably going to be some (40:50 - 40:54)
combination of forward a or 4b is (40:51 - 40:55)
actually the jump (40:54 - 41:01)
ford why back why ducking why the weave (40:55 - 41:03)
out combo of Smashing why I didn't see (41:01 - 41:06)
that translate to other pokemon but most (41:03 - 41:09)
Pokemon have at least a three-set punch (41:06 - 41:11)
based off why so why why why I will so (41:09 - 41:13)
do something it just seems like we've (41:11 - 41:15)
Isles is five of them instead of three (41:13 - 41:17)
logan also says also will you play with (41:15 - 41:20)
me a hundred for a hundred consecutive (41:17 - 41:22)
hours when it comes out i will (41:20 - 41:26)
definitely be playing with fans I'm bad (41:22 - 41:30)
I don't know how how much I can tolerate (41:26 - 41:33)
losing in a row losing is that fun I (41:30 - 41:36)
mean unless I'm getting better I was (41:33 - 41:38)
playing with Micah earlier and just (41:36 - 41:42)
trying out local play so the game runs (41:38 - 41:45)
at 60 frames a second and playing (41:42 - 41:48)
locally I didn't actually talk about (41:45 - 41:49)
this I'm surprised I made this so far (41:48 - 41:52)
playing locally it brings the number 30 (41:49 - 41:56)
I'm honestly surprised how it doesn't (41:52 - 41:59)
feel different what I mean by that is in (41:56 - 42:02)
mario cart when you're playing two (41:59 - 42:03)
people on the same screen it's running (42:02 - 42:06)
at 60 even online and it feels great you (42:03 - 42:08)
know if you're playing that a lot and (42:06 - 42:11)
you add two more if you had one or two (42:08 - 42:13)
more people in which brings it to the (42:11 - 42:16)
four player local you can tell you can (42:13 - 42:18)
tell instantly the difference between (42:16 - 42:21)
the 60 it was running out to the 30 it (42:18 - 42:24)
goes to so I played a lot of poking and (42:21 - 42:27)
then I had my could play with me and I (42:24 - 42:30)
couldn't tell a difference I'm sure (42:27 - 42:33)
there is a difference I'm my skills as a (42:30 - 42:36)
player just it didn't affect me like I (42:33 - 42:38)
didn't feel like I was it I didn't feel (42:36 - 42:39)
like it was less fun I didn't feel like (42:38 - 42:41)
it was like slower I felt like (42:39 - 42:43)
everything I was doing earlier by myself (42:41 - 42:46)
translated a hundred percent over and (42:43 - 42:48)
like I said I'm sure there's a (42:46 - 42:50)
difference but as a casual player it (42:48 - 42:53)
felt just as smooth as 60 with that (42:50 - 42:57)
being said and that goes tough bunny 13 (42:53 - 43:01)
rights in it goes is is the player one (42:57 - 43:03)
the person that has to use the gamepad (43:01 - 43:06)
and player 2 can use the hoary rumor (43:03 - 43:09)
true what's your favorite fighter (43:06 - 43:11)
so if you are playing locally player 1 (43:09 - 43:15)
has to use the Wii U gamepad player 2 (43:11 - 43:18)
can use whatever they want they can use (43:15 - 43:19)
the Wii U pro controller they can use (43:18 - 43:23)
the hoary fighting controller they can (43:19 - 43:26)
use a wii remote with a nunchuck they (43:23 - 43:28)
can use the Wii the Wii classic (43:26 - 43:30)
controller plugged into a Wii Remote (43:28 - 43:33)
player 1 has to use the gamepad there's (43:30 - 43:36)
no way around that so that's why i said (43:33 - 43:41)
earlier local play could not be as fun (43:36 - 43:43)
as other fighters if one person is stuck (43:41 - 43:45)
to the gamepad one they're not looking (43:43 - 43:47)
at that big screen they're looking at a (43:45 - 43:53)
7-inch Wii U game screen and to the (43:47 - 43:56)
deeper l and r i don't know if they're (43:53 - 43:58)
l2 and r2 they don't do anything you (43:56 - 44:02)
have to use the upper the the basic l1 (43:58 - 44:06)
and r1 to do the block to do the (44:02 - 44:10)
assistant to do the burst which to me i (44:06 - 44:13)
have small hands so doing the wii u (44:10 - 44:17)
gamepad for our long local play sections (44:13 - 44:19)
is uncomfortable to me that's just a (44:17 - 44:21)
personal preference if you like playing (44:19 - 44:25)
on the wii u gamepad awesome but you (44:21 - 44:27)
will not be able to do to people with (44:25 - 44:31)
the Horry special edition controllers (44:27 - 44:34)
from my from my understanding that i (44:31 - 44:37)
don't have them but I couldn't set up to (44:34 - 44:41)
Wii U pro controller 'he's i had to be (44:37 - 44:45)
forced as player 1 on the gamepad (44:41 - 44:47)
now my favorite fighter at this moment (44:45 - 44:50)
it has been champ except i just lost 100 (44:47 - 44:52)
times with Machamp online cuz i'm not (44:50 - 44:55)
good but i do like we've I'll a lot to (44:52 - 44:59)
do Megaman champion tweets in similar (44:55 - 45:01)
with other fighting games are there (44:59 - 45:04)
alternative costume skin cones skin (45:01 - 45:07)
tones for duplicate oakmont in place mu (45:04 - 45:10)
mu taneously there are no unlocks for (45:07 - 45:11)

hat on Pikachu you cannot give Charizard (45:11 - 45:18)
a bib you cannot put a you cannot put (45:14 - 45:22)
cowboy boots on we've I'll there's none (45:18 - 45:26)
of that and I didn't see any locks for (45:22 - 45:28)
it there was no custom options there's (45:26 - 45:32)
no way to change your pokemons color now (45:28 - 45:36)
if it is Lucario verse Lucario one will (45:32 - 45:38)
be a different tone but you don't get to (45:36 - 45:40)
pick that that is decided by the game (45:38 - 45:43)
when you go in and if if it does exist I (45:40 - 45:46)
have not seen it and I've put 10 to 15 (45:43 - 45:49)
hours in I just it doesn't exist from (45:46 - 45:52)
what I've investigated there are (45:49 - 45:56)
alternative skin tones for your trainer (45:52 - 45:58)
that you only see at the beginning of (45:56 - 46:03)
the battle Jeff jje two tweets in have (45:58 - 46:05)
you had the opportunity do you play with (46:03 - 46:06)
a special controller which is the Horry (46:05 - 46:09)
I have not I do not have that yet (46:06 - 46:12)
Nintendo sent me a digital copy of the (46:09 - 46:13)
game which means i also don't have the (46:12 - 46:17)
shadow Mewtwo card I do have two (46:13 - 46:20)
horizon-- which I don't know what I'm (46:17 - 46:21)
gonna do with the second one because I (46:20 - 46:23)
can't use two on the same we use so i (46:21 - 46:26)
might return it or might do a giveaway (46:23 - 46:29)
for it i'm not sure yeah i would a the (46:26 - 46:31)
hoary controller seems like one of the (46:29 - 46:33)
best ways to play I've been mostly (46:31 - 46:35)
playing on the wii u gamepad because I (46:33 - 46:38)
because you can play the game without (46:35 - 46:39)
needing the TV it's one of those games (46:38 - 46:41)
where the Wii U gamepad pretty much (46:39 - 46:44)
recreates everything unless you're (46:41 - 46:47)
playing local my one complaint local is (46:44 - 46:49)
so when I was playing with Micah he was (46:47 - 46:51)
like oh let me pull up my move list (46:49 - 46:52)
because he was playing his gang gar and (46:51 - 46:54)
so it pulls it up on the TV and on my (46:52 - 46:57)
screen and if (46:54 - 46:59)
just kind of sucks that like I can't (46:57 - 47:01)
look at my move list when he's looking (46:59 - 47:03)
at his because it mimics both screens (47:01 - 47:05)
which is weird because obviously when (47:03 - 47:07)
you're fighting it doesn't mimic it's (47:05 - 47:09)
just a minor complaint it's not the end (47:07 - 47:13)
of the world bronzong hugs rights in how (47:09 - 47:16)
big are the burger king grilled dogs (47:13 - 47:18)
they only seem as big as a couple bites (47:16 - 47:21)
now Burger King started selling hot dogs (47:18 - 47:23)
they are a dollar ninety-nine for a (47:21 - 47:27)
normal hot dog with relish and a hot dog (47:23 - 47:30)
a chili dog I don't do I don't want (47:27 - 47:33)
extra meat I'm a hot dog on that harm % (47:30 - 47:35)
beef a dollar ninety-nine hot dog you (47:33 - 47:37)
are right does not fill you up you need (47:35 - 47:39)
to so expect to spend four dollars on (47:37 - 47:43)
hot dogs they are good they are they are (47:39 - 47:45)
probably the best hot dog I've ever had (47:43 - 47:48)
at a fast food place besides / tillis (47:45 - 47:50)
portillos has some real good hot dogs (47:48 - 47:53)
but Burger King has a good bun and they (47:50 - 47:57)
got a good dog and I like a good dog (47:53 - 47:59)
it's simple the dollar ninety-nine it's (47:57 - 48:02)
really good that was a great question up (47:59 - 48:04)
no that's all of them last thing i want (48:02 - 48:06)
to touch on is there is a meebo a sport (48:04 - 48:08)
it support it does not matter which (48:06 - 48:11)
amoebas you use you can touch anomie bow (48:08 - 48:13)
to the gamepad a different to me about (48:11 - 48:16)
five different amoebas a day and it (48:13 - 48:19)
unlocks title set let titles and (48:16 - 48:21)
character stuff I didn't I haven't seen (48:19 - 48:23)
a meebo unlike anything else but if you (48:21 - 48:24)
have five different of evos you can (48:23 - 48:26)
touch those to the gamepad every day and (48:24 - 48:29)
unlock stuff and that's the extent of (48:26 - 48:31)
the meebo sport I've used a pikachu i (48:29 - 48:33)
used a luigi i use animal crossing (48:31 - 48:34)
villager it didn't care if it was (48:33 - 48:38)
pokemon or not i think that's it i think (48:34 - 48:40)
that is the review i can't believe i (48:38 - 48:42)
talked for almost an hour about this I (48:40 - 48:44)
honestly thought this was going to be 10 (48:42 - 48:47)
minutes hopefully you guys enjoyed it to (48:44 - 48:51)
reiterate it's good pokin is good it has (48:47 - 48:54)
scratched the itch I had for fighting (48:51 - 48:55)
games i'm glad i waited for this and not (48:54 - 48:58)
and didn't buy Street Fighter 5 because (48:55 - 49:01)
I know that I would be even worse than (48:58 - 49:03)
street fighter than I am at pokin it's (49:01 - 49:06)
really fun it's really easy to get into (49:03 - 49:08)
as a fighting game if you do not like (49:06 - 49:10)
fighting games poking is not going to be (49:08 - 49:10)
the one that could (49:10 - 49:14)
is you unless you honestly love pokemon (49:10 - 49:15)
that much that you want to give it a (49:14 - 49:19)
shot I will go back to my my smash (49:15 - 49:21)
brothers check do you like super smash (49:19 - 49:25)
brothers if that answer is a yes that (49:21 - 49:29)
answer is yeah I would play it then you (49:25 - 49:30)
would probably enjoy poking if you don't (49:29 - 49:32)
like smash brothers don't like anything (49:30 - 49:34)
about smash brothers you're not gonna (49:32 - 49:36)
like poking I think that's that I think (49:34 - 49:38)
that's as fair as I can be I'm having a (49:36 - 49:41)
great time with pokin I am not having a (49:38 - 49:43)
great time losing I don't have a great (49:41 - 49:45)
time playing against computers so it's (49:43 - 49:47)
kind of a slug to go through the story (49:45 - 49:51)
but I had a heck of a time playing on (49:47 - 49:54)
the couch with two of my friends I don't (49:51 - 49:56)
know how well that will translate we're (49:54 - 49:58)
playing with people online like people I (49:56 - 50:01)
know online I just don't know this has (49:58 - 50:04)
been the podcast this has been the (50:01 - 50:07)

stuff it's in Chicago my panels at (50:34 - 50:39)
eleven kind of early I would recommend (50:37 - 50:42)
getting there at like nine because (50:39 - 50:43)
you're going to spend like an hour (50:42 - 50:46)
trying to find parking in an hour that's (50:43 - 50:48)
probably going to be an hour right there (50:46 - 50:50)
it's just parking so I would if you plan (50:48 - 50:52)
on going i would expect to get there as (50:50 - 50:54)
early as you can just because Chicago (50:52 - 50:57)
has the worst traffic in the world other (50:54 - 50:59)
