what's up everyone welcome to the two hundred and twenty ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host SBJ I usually say it's super effective I forgot to my left I don't know why I say lesson right I have will as we chart my continual and steady progress into I don't know decay and this marathon training is killing me it's giving me all right no haha no no one's forcing you to run that far the Marines are forcing me they're not giving me my money back I know I did 13 and a half miles this morning and yeah it took its toll on me oh gosh that's so far now it's only thirteen and a half miles whatever being a far Travis is here I apologize if I sound a little different I'm in my lowell inform know what a joke did I like it I mean yeah it was probably your funniest in a while do you have a different cry in your a lowland form you're putting me on the spot um my different cry in my ole ole inform is that was my attempt at making the strange garbled electronic sounds your eyes are I'm gonna cut that from the audio and make it I'll do lube oh oh I was a cut it out because oh no no saying i always go love love saying it's sound bite worthy oh gosh love your cry hey hey will how about you make a funny sound at no that's what you're here for oh my gosh I'm the straight man funny or not so if you are a new listener this is a pokemon podcast surprise and we have a show for you guys we have first off some news our middle segment we'll be talking about the five new pokemon that have been shown since the last episode and then we have a Pokemon of the week and if time permits we will do emails but last couple episodes been almost two hours long so the only reason we keep cutting emails because emails would probably bring every episode 23 hours not that anyone might be might be against that but Travis gets real cranky passes yes unfair Sunday bedtime if we run too long it's Sunday bedtime of two o'clock in the afternoon how do i usually wake up again beauty sleep that's yeah and i usually wake up and start recording so i miss breakfast and lunch and i usually eat lunch immediately after this so sometimes I get cranky because I'm hungry before we dive into pokemon stuff will how was your week I mean it's okay i'm still still have a cold from gencon so that's kind of been rocking me but you know still get my monster hunter in did some vanguard stuff i got some new cards in so that's all super exciting whoo Travis what's new it's been two weeks now since you were last on but something's right because I was on the last one and then the week well then the week before we played the Kickstarter Kickstarter special so it's been like three weeks st. same old same old overwatch season ended installed the PTR patch so i could play start playing competitive season 2 before it's really out playing a lot of diva even though i don't think the character is very interesting it's the only character i'm good at solid I always liked zenyatta zenyatta is very very awesome and in fact is quite good well they buffed him or sorry they nerfed him slightly in the newest patch and I'm not sure how that's going to shake out i think i'll still be used but previous to the newest patch that's on the public test realm zenyatta was incredibly powerful and was in every single composition that's cool well in my neck of the woods Thank everything I have it is related back to pokemon i think been playing some monster hunter we talked about that or at least will did but i've also been playing monster hunter well you guys had like a mega monster hunter meet up last night didn't you I wouldn't say was mega we had six p people though it was like a hundred messages in skype yeah which is nice because we were able to break off into two groups of three so some people were hunter rank one and they were able to increase our hunter rank and then myself Logan and Jack were all wanting to get the gore set so we hunted that four or five times yes I was a pretty progress filled monster hunter night otherwise my week has also been dedicated to cleaning up and still putting out podcast there was a lot of podcasts that I had still from gencon one of them being the dungeons and dragon knights special that we recorded at gencon him the first episode just went up last night and that is a three or four part series i can't remember exactly how many we recorded but whether it's three or whether it's for it's a it's contained in in that amount and so you're gonna get off you're gonna get a side story from season one and you don't actually have to listen to season one if season one was a turn off or you just didn't like where the story was going this has some of the same characters and some of the new ones and i think uh maybe Travis can help me out here but I think the first episode kind of established who everyone was pretty quickly what kind of personalities they were yeah I just listened to it today it said it seems like a fun light-hearted group to of characters to join on this little side mission yeah oh yeah and Anna I would say that my character Wendy from season one would be very pleased at how often you talked about her well she know she'd be very pleased that you were still thinking about her I was going to say I listened to the whole thing this morning and I mean obviously I was in the room when you guys were recording it but I wasn't really paying attention to you guys I think k in not doing any kind of acting at all but just being himself it's absolutely hilarious oh we made me laugh so much hey as a Troy yeah okay II just in person he's like such a super polite person and that comes across in the way that he's playing its character it just makes me laugh oh wow yeah it's if you haven't you haven't listened to it and I maybe most of you haven't because it literally just went up last night the cool thing about it is because it was recorded in Gen Con all seven of us were sitting in the same room at the same table and so you can really kind of get that feel from it where sometimes when you record a podcast over Skype or the internet or however you do it sometimes there's a disconnect or things don't come out as naturally or as smoothly as they they can and that's obviously what editing's for and even this podcast was heavily edited just because of Mike noises and because of instances where one person talks over the other just like this yeah but yeah it was edited I think it turned out well the first episodes about an hour so if you're looking for power if you're looking for more Pokemon content and you like D&D maybe you're just unsure by Cindy I would definitely give it a chance very easy to find on Google Play or iTunes or wherever you're listening to this podcast you'll be able to listen to dungeon dragon knights just search for pkmn cast or just search for dungeons and dragon i'ts and you should be able to find it still really proud of how that turned off and then episode 2 of that should be up within a week with the same kind of treatment and care I think I think you okay go ahead boy we're just gonna talking over each other these guys are pretty good at nap Oh something in the air it's probably my fault I haven't been here in three weeks or whatever I think it's fair to say that the amount of Pokemon content varies between episode to episode of dungeons and dragon i'ts too so if you listen to one and you think oh there wasn't enough Pokemon in there in fact i think the the introductory episode of the gencon special has next to no actual pokemon content because just learning about the characters but pokemon show up in encounters and they show up as allies and that sort of thing so it's always cool to have this fantasy setting that's injected with that pokemon flavor yeah and I was going to say I think Steve you put a lot more musical cues a lot more thought into musical cues in so that's really entertaining in this little short short one yeah cool yeah I wanted to make sure that I don't know what what the word would be but just kind of add more flair to the episode without overdoing it and Travis and I talked about them before the show and he said that it was just the right amount so I'm glad that that worked out okay tonight's kinase to make this a delicious sandwich can I say one negative thing yes that you can do nothing about but that I noticed incredibly uh you can't hear the dice rolls yeah yeah that is I thought I also thought about adding in dice rolls after the fact but then I was like now that might sound like we're trying to imply something uh or like takes take away the genuineness of it and I was like well now like just trusted the dicer being rolled I was surprised how focused those mics were they were they were dynamic mic so you really have to be looking straight at them to talk it definitely worked because when you rolled the dice you didn't really hear them because they weren't exactly in front of the mic it King or any dice rolls but you can certainly hear those police sirens those might have been artificially drafted ah wait what yeah oh cuz you responded you responded to ones you heard in real life correct but then the microphones didn't pick them up yes and that joke is probably reacted to them so you got it yeah and the jokes used at least one more time in a later episode because the police kept going by yes there the police did keep going by that's kind of cool that the police sounds fooled you guys I was listening in thinking that is bizarre how loud that is considering their setup but I was I did not even consider for one moment that you added them in yeah yeah there's also like a chicken sound I edge yeah obviously I mean you don't have a chicken in the room no no not I mean maybe we did maybe I mean it alright let's jump into some Pokemon news throw some Pokemon go news Pokemon go player tries getting a million XP and a day gets treated like a cheater that's a good headline right as for Pokemon go is concerned only cheaters should be able to get massive amounts in XP of XP in a short amount of time Jimmy D is a hard can't say his last name so I'm just gonna say Jimmy D Jimmy D is our hardcore Pokemon go player who spent much of the last couple weeks devising an ingenious plan to a cure as much HP XP sorry as humanly possible earlier this month he managed to find a way to get a million XP over the course of the reason the weakened oh man I'm just not reading well today the reason internet commenters kept alleging that it should be impossible to get that much XP without cheating and Jimmy D wanted to prove everyone wrong this weekend d turned up up a notch by devising a special walking route through austin texas this is his ingenious plan number one never make the lat though never make a lap last more than five minutes number two never stop and catch unless there are more Pokemon at your current node number three take breaks at one and three and then reverse the direction frequently and number four minimize lap distance whenever possible I and there is a map of 1 through 10 of polka stops that he is walking to this is by this article's off kotaku by the way what he ended up doing is we placed in game leurs at 10 polka stops at a point 2 mile loop which plan to walk over and over people called it Jimmy's loop the plan at the time was to get a million XP in a single day to prove the channel challenges legitimate see he was also going to livestream the entire event on Twitch with the help of the friends who were able who were also undertaking the challenge news broke out hundreds of people showed up on Twitch to watch the undertaking and according to facebook a thousand people said they were going to join in the festivities in person as well everyone wanted to see if d's plan actually worked no matter what he did or will poke one he put while he used every single Monster started running away from d he was triggered pokey triggered Pokemon goes anti-cheating measures after amassing around 600,000 XP through legitimate means knee antic labs recently implemented an anti bottling policy becoming more well known to players as a soft band more or less the policy is a 24-hour cheating prevention tool to stop you from getting more XP than should be possible since release Pokemon go has suffered a strong botting o botting I don't know as a bottling bodying community who have used third-party software to automate playing the game botters were able to occur ridiculous levels and strong pokemon that no one else could making the game unfair in a sense I was trying to prove to natick that their limits were actually hurting players who play efficiently Jimmy said I'm a bit of a hardcore gamer and I play somewhat efficiently but the point is I shouldn't be hitting a 24-hour ban limit in just over a half of that time Jimmy said bots are more efficient than humans are and I think an effective soft man would have been put haphazardly hurting a lot more players than expected the good news is despite the soft band for hours d raised enough money for charity during the live stream that he'll be able to donate the money for a good cause i logged 25 miles using the charity miles and i will be able to donate 50 to 60 dollars to charity thanks to my stream donations we could have easily managed to get five to ten times the amount of donations if there was a full stream closing out Jimmy says I was still able to spin poker stops after getting soft band i also got 25 XP from pokemon running away people laughed on stream because i continued to play for over an hour and a half after getting something like 25,000 experience games are meant to be played and in my opinion played well Jimmy says and just to interpret for our audience occur a cure in SBJ speak is a crew in English I feel like you'd say the word both ways I feel that there's one way to say a crew hey Jimmy what do you do this weekend hey Jimmy what um do anything fun this weekend uh yeah I prove that it's possible to make pokemon go think I'm a robot good job great work it's like a reverse Turing test I couldn't do you guys agree with the what are your thoughts that Jimmy D was soft band not permanently banned just soft band for 24 hours it sounds like what he did was incredibly choreographed so that that would happen I mean he even basically says so that he was trying to get as much exp is was possible in that amount of time and I wonder is there really an epidemic of players being soft band for flying legitimately because they're doing what he's doing or is this just an extreme circumstance of someone trying to find a very small hole in a system and and pointed out it I mean I don't you know I don't know if there are a bunch of people who are experiencing this but to me it sounds like it's not as big of a problem as he's trying to portray it as uh yeah I I don't think it's that big of a problem I think that the only reason this really made news is because it was on twitch and there was a Facebook group and he somewhat promoted it and they gained attention and news media's especially are still grasping onto Pokemon go news because it brings in traffic but I don't know you can jump a lot of levels pretty fast in Pokemon go especially before level 20 and that's a lot of XP and a lot of time but it's not nearly the amount of XP that Jimmy was trying to go for here but I feel like knee antic acknowledged what he was doing I think it would be more frustrating or weirder if niantic didn't say anything and he was just soft band but like he knew he was going to get soft band because he knew that at a certain point in the antic restricts the amount of XP that are coming in to prevent right obviously the restriction is in effect because people made BOTS and the bots were getting over set amount of XP so that's why the soft band is in effect and it seemed like he wanted to prove that yes a single person could get this amount of XP if they did that if they dedicated pretty much 12 or more hours to do something like that right and it's such a focused way to and it's like it's almost like niantic is pushing back and saying you know we made a game that's intended for people to enjoy not for people to turn into a job right because he had to work at it he had to plan a route and like actually like really work really hard at pushing to get all those XP points and that's not how Pokemon go is intended to be played there is no wind condition in Pokemon go you don't get a prize for having like the highest level so you need to chill and just enjoy you don't get press for having all the pokemon either you just don't get anything I don't mean to like I'm not trying to like invalidate his way of playing like he said he enjoys playing games that I at the highest level he can but at the same time I find it strange that he's articulating it as if this is some issue that's plaguing a whole bunch of players that niantic needs to fix when in reality it's a problem for a very very small percentage of players and maybe even that percentage of players is simply people trying to make it happen at that point why not just say hey I'm trying to do something fun this weekend I'm trying to make I'm trying to hit the soft been limit legitimately as opposed to portraying it as like a fault with the game I don't know I forgot about you well I have a friend whose name starts with the letter S I'm not going to get any more explicit than that but this person really does not enjoy any game where there's like no clear winning so I can imagine that that friend would also be as frustrated by such a such a game and expose a similar types of beliefs you know some people could be on the side of the fence where they agree that there should be a soft band at you know 600,000 XP which again is a ridiculous amount of XP you would really have to dedicate your entire day to hit that level of XP just like Jimmy D did the other side would you know kind of agree with Jimmy and go he should be able to play and enjoy the game at how he wants if he wants to keep going for the entire 14 15 16 hours they should let him but in reality there are a lot of games that put bands or not bands but they throttle the game in some way a game like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy you can only do this event once every 24 hours a game like destiny the same thing this event only happens for you know this weekend and then you gotta wait an entire weekend again it's you can complain that you hit that soft band but at the end of the day it's still the game company's decision to limit the play and they limit that based on everyone just not you or just not the exceptions like in final fantasy 14 I can only go to the casino and I can only buy three lottery tickets and every ticket gets more expensive if I could complain and say well that's my favorite part of the game I want to keep buying tickets no matter how expensive they get but they don't do that and I maybe I'm the exception and i want to buy more lottery tickets but you know Square Enix isn't going to change the game because I hit the limit of only buying three tickets obviously three tickets and 600,000 XP is is drastically different but the comparison can still be made there are other examples of you know you can only do this in a game once every 24 hours or once every 48 hours or it's not like Pokemon go as the first game to restrict how a player plays in a certain amount of time so to put this in terms that our audience can understand how many cats is 600,000 XP how many cats Oh things in cats yeah I would probably say you know a thousand XP per cat so you're you're looking at like sixty thousand cats or six hundred cats yes did I miss an episode where did this joke come from yes you did miss an episode I think we were talkin to the newest one with you and with the two of you and Stephen is that not the lamest yeah I at one point somebody said like how big is that I would and I said oh it's like three cats big and I kept I kept going and afterwards like people on Twitter and in slack we were like they thought that was the funniest thing ever and I didn't think anything of it I just thought like if you like stacked one cat on top of two cats and that was like a shape that would be what we were comparing it to but yeah apparently i measure things based off how many cats would fit into it so wasn't in episode content it was you know it was instead he was well you said it will you said it in an episode but the joke of it was created on yeah it's red you know sure yeah when I said it everyone just kind of accepted that and moved on oh yeah that makes it really gather you to be on this show yeah Pokemon go still exists um I play you know I when I get somewhere I when I get somewhere new I open the app up I check and if there's a focus the really i'm checking for a polka stop there's really not many pokemon that I don't have that would excite me to see maybe if I like I like if some missing like cypher so I i guess i would get excited if there was a scyther but you know I am I don't have the expectation or the the hope that when I randomly opened the app site there would be the one I see that being said I normally open the app when I'm at a new location see if there's a polka stop there or just to see how many polka stops are there and recently I haven't been getting out of the house much though when I go to in my normal places of like Target or McDonald's or woodmans or wherever I normally go oh I don't even bring up the phone anymore because I know that there's nothing there there's no poka stops here my pokemon go has definitely been a lot less but it also doesn't help that it's it's been 96 degrees here in Wisconsin and if you're gonna if I'm going to pick between going outside in 96 degree weather to play pokemon go or sitting inside where it's air conditioning and playing Monster Hunter I think the choice is pretty easy hopefully you know when the weather gets a bit better when it cools off a bit i will definitely go back down i'm not done with pokemon go I I don't dislike Pokemon go it it's just weather plays a big factor in my Pokemon go enjoyment I'm gonna have to ask the question that I'm sure all of our listeners are wondering which is what on earth is Woodman's yeah like in the same thing but I didn't speak up oh my god the Woodman's is a grocery store uh similar to pick and save or uh yet you're gonna have to run that one by me too how I I don't want to say similar to meijer because a Meyer is more of a walmart right so probably like a century that we have krogh of kroger over there no we don't have kroger way no no no so sentry is the real low end yes entrance entries like a grocery store but I tiny grocery store where's the one that we went to when I needed to get like protein bars was that it was like kind of like you had to go through what's that really poor section called that really bad section that we had to drive through and you're like oh you don't wanna live around here and then you cross this line and you're in like Wauwatosa and you're like oh it's really nice here yeah what was it a century no no no it was nice a pic and SAV would many be May it might have been a pig and yeah I I bet it was like one of the fancy pic and saves which is called or it could have been a fancy century because there's one fan tree sent fancy century / pick and save in Wauwatosa what about a Piggly Wiggly do you guys have that I don't but I know what Piggly Wiggly is so I would say that there only three grocery stores in DC so okay i would say that sentry is the low end and then Piggly Wiggly is a step up only because Piggly wigglies are bigger than century that's the only reason it's a step up and then i would say that there's pic and SAV which is the big box shopping area where it's only food and i don't even go to pick and save anymore because i go to meijer but i would argue that pic and SAV has more variety of food but Meyer also has your electronics in your clothes and your household items because it's more of a Walmart and then there's a Woodman's and Woodman's is twice as big as a pic and SAV almost always it's just a huge huge and it's only grocery but the other thing about Woodman's that is great is almost every woodmans i'm pretty sure every Woodman's is 24 hours so if you also Woodman's doesn't take credit card they only take cash and debit card that is sketchy as all get-out so when you go people p ID a Woodman's is closed on almost being sam's club level of like people go to sam's club because they're buying like two months worth of food right if you're going to woodmans you're probably buying like a month's worth of food and I feel like if you're going to pick and save you're probably buying like two weeks worth of food and if you're going to sentry I'm sorry hahahaha just end it right there second chances this week on grocery store cast back to the Pokemon back to a second chance to get Darkrai will be available in the American region

ish news here nintendos articles off TechCrunch Nintendo 3ds sales up eighty percent year over a year on Pokemon go success also they didn't capitalize the oh and go so that's a little frustrating Nintendo had a very good month in mobile gaming according to NPD Group latest data the 3ds one in both hardware and software sales for the analyst firms latest tracker report with the 3ds and his family including the new 3ds the 3ds XL and the 2ds up eighty percent for july verse july of 2015 pokemon omega red that's what it says and alpha sapphire the latest console titles in the franchise were also up eighty percent year-over-year the halo effect doesn't stop with the latest and greatest in pokemon console games however sales of pokemon X&Y which were first released in october of 2013 you guys imagine it's been that long we're up a huge two hundred percent compared to the sales of july last year nintendo strong july wasn't only a result of pokemon goes over interest however games for nintendo systems took the five of the top 11 spots for software sales overall with monster hunter generations coming in at number one minecraft wii u edition pokemon omega ruby hey they got to write this time and sapphire both games that came out nearly two years ago and kirby planet robot also made solid showings while nintendo might not be much directly from pokemon go nintendo is flat-out said they have no ties to pokemon go besides giving the money the franchise's biggest move to smartphones is filling up sales of the game company in key ways and this is a great setup launch for pokemon sun and moon for 3ds this november November eighteenth to be specific didn't say that in the news articles I'm saying that because I feel like I know more than this reporter mr. Pokemon Omega Red well at least the reporter knew that it's Kirby planet robobot I know they got planet robot it he broke planet robot oh that's so sad Kirby planet robot I read this right oh that's not even the right name uh-oh megared what a winner well it's it's really sad to hear that you know Nintendo is obviously going out of business right yeah they should just can't sell systems they should just switch to you know only smart phones because clearly these other three or four year old games that are on top of the charts are clearly not bringing in money the trap is has no comment because he's never played monster hunter it's it sure I'm never one monster on road I've been then I feel like though that this makes sense like when I read this news article when I saw other people reporting on this I the voice in my head was was like this is what we all talked about months ago this is what we talked about when Pokemon go was announced that this is purely obviously Pokemon go is a game but this is a purely marketing strategy to get people interested in pokemon that weren't interested in Pokemon and get them to buy hardware and software from Nintendo granted I think all three of us all three of us didn't think Pokemon go would be a phenom phenom banana it's hard to say just yeah nom nom I don't think I'd you at all who I have I can say it perfectly but Pokemon go we never thought Pokemon go would be a feline the the people who are buying x and y right now the people who are buying Omega Ruby alpha sapphire right now the people who are buying 3 s's right now are not hardcore Pokemon people they are people that because of Pokemon go they are now interested in Pokemon Nintendo the pokemon company they knew exactly what they were doing and it worked and we're seeing it now yep yep no surprise i needed i think it's cool i am i'm glad that pokemon go has led to more people getting into the main series games because so many of those people didn't buy anything after red and blue and then yeah and I decision that made the decision that they that the games aren't worth playing and there's some amazing experiences to be at the series so I'm really glad I think I think x and y are great games when you get a 3d s you can also get red blue and yellow from the eShop those hoke manga transferred in the sun and moon everett everything is everything is coming up milhouse I knew you were gonna save it you know I thought of a different I just you know that worked the best and that's situation alright final news item here before we take a break ah this is from reddit this is one of the subreddits I visit a lot so actually I stumbled upon this unknowingly unwillingly but I I visit our / out of the loop a lot because I for one do not want to be out of the loop when it comes to things at most of the time everything I'm out of the loop I falls into two categories one I don't care or two no three categories one I don't care so I don't read it too oh I already know that that's cool i feel like i'm already and i feel like a cool kid and three I don't know about that let me read it this I hate to say was oh my god I don't know about that let me read it idol the threat is what happened with Pokemon and ash and why people are upset and so when I saw the title of that I went oh my gosh I'm always in the loop for Pokemon how am I out of the loop and what is this about so I clicked on it and the body of thread says I recently subscribe to our / Pokemon subreddit there have been multiple posts and thousands of comments supposedly upset at what has happened except I don't know what has happened and everyone is acting a bit of outrage again this doesn't clear up why people are upset about Pokemon and ash but the most hop aboard a comment clearly points that out routine now here ash had the possibility to finally win the pokémon league for the first time of the entire anime series this was the first time he reached the finals and he lost spoiler by the way I believe this is only aired in japan right now is that correct will I I don't know because I'm having a TV problem but you're probably right the uploaded comment also had a graph of or not a graph but an image of ashes standings which is really great because I I couldn't remember where he placed in previous pokemon league championships and I kind of stopped watching after joto I think but I mean I've watched some of the you Nova and I watched some of the sinnoh but I never watched the whole series I will say though the pokemon league stuff is usually the best stuff in the anime but for our listeners at home in the Kanto series actually let's make this a little bit of a game where how top did you do you guys remember ash placing in canto did he make it to the second round and then he was out let's put it in terms of final two top four top eight top 16 and top 32 I'd say top 32 for canto Travis the dark miasma that haunts me and my dreams has deleted all of those memories from that age so I I honestly could not tell you I I don't have a very good memory for content that I haven't seen in that long neither do i I've cuz I didn't realize that he made the top 16 in canto I believe he wat lost Richie was that it or did he lose to Gary I can't remember I've been a long time it's been a long time in johto which I don't remember that league at all maybe that was roachie uh he lost you made it to the top eight in Hoenn he made it to the top eight in sinnoh he made it to the top four in you Nova will you probably know this you big you know of a fan put me on the spot is gonna say he didn't even go to the you know the league oh he did he did he made top eight at you Nova and in Kalos why people are upset is because he was final two and then he lost I don't know much about the battle itself from screenshots I saw it think it came down to his greninja in ash form versed uh mega Charizard the black and blue one Oh is he playing along yes yes he lost a lon cool what a beautiful wrap up to the mega evolution specials and and this XYZ series coming together that's that's real nice Yeah right right he said a lot and that kind of all clicked with me from what I read for our listeners who is a lime and you seemed really excited that ash lost to him well Ilan is the protagonist of the mega evolution specials so if you've watched those then he's the guy who's traveling around trying to learn about mega evolution he used to be one of Professor sycamores assistance but then he decided to pursue his own journey and he's kind of funded by Lysander and in his journey to find out more about mega evolution wait so Zia babka he's of dubious moral quality kinda in it for himself because you know he did let that chespin go into a coma and like just left it but so is he is he is he a jerk to ash is he is he like a Gary oh he's very he's very supportive of ash oh very supportive in and he is also like wants to investigate and learn more about the ash greninja whatever is going on with that biz um but he is funded by team flare and he does a few things at the request of and behest of Lysander so do you know his you know his other Pokemon besides mega Charizard oh that's really the only one that he brings out most of the time I don't remember what else okay it's really really reading reading this thread and knowing that Ash losses makes me want to watch that whole league championship I don't know how many episodes it is i remember in the Kanto it was probably I want to say like eight or six episodes that kind of and those are my favorite pokemon episodes the ones that are just like battle battle battle battle battle I just I don't know there's i'm sure those are the a lot of people's favorites because it's not the off topic kind of let's get to destination but we're in this town and there's a pincer and a cycler fighting and none of this is really relevant but it's gonna waste 23 minutes but yeah I don't know I feel like that's something I'd be very interested in watching and then it kind of makes me want to go back and watch his other league championships so I wonder if those are available because that's something I kind of want to do now well I do have the last few episodes of Pokemon X Y Z on my bedroom DVR since my living room tbo oh I don't want to say that work is I got made fun of so much the last time I said it what living room no TiVo so my tivo is the one that stopped working and it's typically what I would use to record cartoon network on so I did switch to my bedroom DVR which is the one that you have access to so if you want to fire that up well don't delete them because I haven't seen them yet to also start recording pokemon on my playstation view anyways yeah so i flossed people are upset that's kind of cool to see that people somewhat care that or are somewhat frustrated that ash still cannot be number one that has been everything for news here unless I missed something but what we'll do here is we'll take a quick break when we come back we have five new Sun and Moon Pokemon to talk about and yeah we'll continue on this journey you and we are back from our break we got some new Pokemon to talk about let's start with really bad at closing windows today let's start with the pokemon that was shown at Gamescom which was originally shown in german and then about five minutes after that showing the pokemon company the English account tweeted the image and English name for said pokemon it is a fire dragon pokemon it's known as Kurt inator which is a it's known as the land mine pokemon i do know that in the debut trailer showed off a unique move called shell trap where it shoots a laser out of its hardened shell to keep foes grounded turton ater also has the ability shell armor which I what does that new Travis shell armor it when you're when you take it I think it only is attack stat my contact but I might be incorrect it might just be any attack and I think it is any attack when you take damage your defense goes down but your speed goes up let's just off the dome I'm not sure if that's right I can look it up for you though alright as you look that up it is a red turtle like pokemon x ki flat helmet spiky back red and yellow it also i'm assuming it's its name is turtle and terminator heard a neighbor who knows I turns out I was wrong i was thinking of weak armor which is when you're hit by a physical move your defense is lowered and your speed is increased the shell armor prevents critical hits got it and that's pretty much all we know for Turton ater i don't know if you guys had any inputs on it fire dragon like this one I'm really impressed um I don't know if anybody noticed her has watched the video gameplay video and I don't know I've never seen another Pokemon that does this but it keeps its back to the battle yeah throughout the entire battle which is really cool yeah it does i notice that cool that gamescom got exclusive Pokemon I I just happened to turn that stream on because somebody tweeted it and put me in front of a bunch of German people laughing and talking and I can't look away they showed the trailer I we did it was it was cool it's I'm sure turtles are plentiful in Hawaii I mean turtles are pretty common all over the world so I actually saw a turtle in Indianapolis so there you go just hanging out all right it's like in the grass so we have some pokemon that was revealed at the World Championships here one specifically and then there was a video that showed three more but the one that was showed on stage before the World Championship stuff began was a Pokemon called crab aller crab brawler however you want to say that it is a fighting type Pokemon even though it looks like it should be a water-type pokemon crowler crab aller is a boxing Pokemon that really hates to lose it can be found clinging to buildings with its powerful pincers that also pack a punch or getting around in trees in search of berries its favorite food well that you know sums up this Pokemon a lot of people are super excited about this pokemon that I saw via Twitter and the just general feel of worlds it's a fighting pokemon even though it kind of looks like it should be water especially because it's a crab I feel like this Pokemon is is almost like the hollow of the generation where you're not going to get where it's single stage what are you guys his thoughts on cry baller but my thoughts are I was reading Twitter this morning and I saw that junichi Masuda had tweeted his lunch you know cuz he's in San Francisco for worlds right now and it was this huge plate of like fried crab and crab legs and all of the responses to that were like what did you do to crab brawler with a few poor Crabbie's thrown in is this our fifth crap pokemon crabby kingler oh and wells are poets there's a shrimp oh yeah sure it's a pistol shrimp um or the is uh maybe maybe although technically it's the boxing Pokemon yeah yeah it's that's I have a theory that this pokemon is gonna be used a lot by team skull base all year I saw your tweet and I think that's I think that's pretty accurate yeah they drew one of creb ballers eyes to have half moon and it's exactly like how team skulls goggles are yeah did you see that that somebody commented that the goggles are like that because it's a Sun and a moon yeah somebody did say like the goggles are so that can't remember credit there is your credit person we can't remember the next Pokemon on the list is stuffed full I think I'm saying that right is a normal fighting pokemon shuffle may have a small body but it's this Pokemon has extraordinary strength despite its cute fluffy appearance stuff old dislikes being touched and will flail its arm as in protest that's actually really cute stuff will evolve into beware and stuff all still has the tag on its butt yeah it has its little tag on this but which i think is really cool I'm assuming stuff elizth and then full so full of stuffing is how I'm breaking down its name also it folks the word snuggle as teddy bears are often smuggled oh I'm not this one because it doesn't like to be touched yeah I think it's yelling there yeah I think it's cool it's clearly your cup to your teddiursa your what's that panda called Pancham of the generation gotta have I gotta have your bears I think it's I think I like stuff all more than I like beware but then again beware uh I don't know this what's weird it's a weird weird little dude let's talk you duffyls cute ah let's talk about this you best pokemon that probably have been shown for this generation our first one is sandy guest which is a gross / ground type Pokemon sandy gasps emerges when the rudge's of fallen pokemon soak into sand for battle and it's a tunnel metal like mouth can suck the vitality from people and Pokemon sandy gasps also features a new water compaction ability never before seen in other Pokemon where its defense set goes up by two when it's hit by a water pipe move sandy gasps evolves into Palos and do we know if it's also immune to water types does it take damage when it takes a water type attack I read that as it still takes damage yeah I think they actually blocked that so you couldn't tell so it is up still up in the air interesting I feel like it would still take the damage but that's just me well storm drain doesn't take the damage right yeah but what a there's like a thunder move that takes the damage and then the thing still goes up or is that flare blitz I'm thinking of but that's how I move now that ability ya know lightning lightning rod image yeah prevents the damage is lightning rod and storm drain the only GU a water absorb is similar to that you don't take damage and you restore health when it by a water move sap zipper is the same but for well sap zipper you are immune to grass moves and you get special attack increase when you're hit with a grass move I think that's what it is halo sand which to me feels like the Chandeleur of this generation ghost / ground pelo sand disguises itself as a sand castle with its shovel on top serving it is believed as a radar to search out prey this unsuspecting small Pokemon are dragged into palo Sam's body through its sandy vortex so it can steal their life force wait you just missed out on the most important thing about Palos and hey I read the press release it created possibly the greatest piece of official Pokemon art to ever have been released into the world idalis and dragging the pikachu will excise down to its doom it is beautiful haha it is really sweet that art is a really fantastic and that is one hundred percent official i am looking at it on their website right now really great Travis how do you feel about saying to guess and palace palace and I think they're pretty cool I don't I know a lot of people love them and I get it but I don't I've liked a lot of the pokemon that have been announced previous to this like I think my favorite of the other than then rowlett I think my favorite of the new pokemon that have been announced is cutie fly but yeah I mean hello sounds cool I prefer my ghost grounds to be going and golurk I think that line is really cool alright alright I think Palos sand a short for pail of sand that's safe to say well what are your thoughts on these two I just am laughing to myself because so many people when the coro coro leaks first came out that were like oh this is this generation's trubbish in garbodor you know muck and grime er there these are terrible who cares about them and now like a bunch of people are like all these are the greatest things I've ever seen they are pretty great how opinions change I think a lot of people see it at face value where when you kind of dig into what was written about palette puns when you uh when you dig into palace and it is something it is a being it's just disguising itself as a sand castle which i think is really cool and it gives you more lore and more history behind that Pokemon obviously like in the anime there is the famous ghastly episode where ghastly like masks itself as that girl that died or died waiting for her lover to come back usually it's ghastly and not nine tails cuz nine tails had a whole ghost spirit house thing going on ah no I'm pretty sure was ghastly it was the one where ash brock and missed he arrived at the carnival and then at the top of the hill over the water there was a statue of a girl and then gastly was turning into it and then James fell in love with the ghost girl and the brock fellow love with the ghost girl then they realized it was ghastly I think it was gas lease first appearance action sure I have no idea who's the anime expert now it's never been me that's for darn tootin I've Travis you weren't here last week when we talked about team skull I wanted to touch on that real quick what are your thoughts on the new bad gas I think they're they're pretty cool I like how they have the feel of more like a seems like they're more evenly matched for our protagonist it seems sensible because it it looks like a lot of young people it makes more sense that the villainous team is not a collection of adults trying to wrest palkia and dialga into the universe to destroy it or whatever and that it's it seems like it's aiming towards a more focused insular story with them which I think could be done really well just because they seem like they're younger people with with like a obvious influences from like kind like I guess like 90s gang culture or something but also all of the I don't know it I I haven't quite figured out where all of the influences are supposed to come from but but I think it'll lead to a more realistic feeling story where the player character is in a ten-year-old child foiling that evil plans of someone who wants to you know destroy the world or whatever which he talked about last week and I concur yeah I wanted to ask your thoughts on some of the other pokemon that you weren't here for but I forgot we had the last bit of news here that was shown at Worlds is from the pokemon TCG the in early 2017 so a little bit little bit ways off the pokemon TCG will introduce the sun and moon series and new pokemon and GX cards the term GX describes special attacks and special pokemon that are completely new to the pokemon TCG these exciting advancements will require players to develop new tax tactics and strategy as they engage in one of the world's most popular trading card games GX attacks what are they let me tell you each Pokemon GX has a devastating GX attack that can instantly revert a player's disadvantage or create an early game advantage yeah that's what we need more early game advantage the player can can't use more than one GX attack in a game so deciding when to use a GX attack so deciding when GX attack to use and when poses a strategic strategic challenge Pokemon GX in the pokemon TCG Sun and Moon Pokemon GX will make their first appearance there are four defining characteristics of a Pokemon GX only pokemon GX have GX attacks and can only be used once per game each Pokemon GX has a minimum of two attacks in addition to its GX attack Pokemon GX have ordinary attacks and abilities besides their GX attacks it is possible to use different attacks and as the situation demands Pokemon GX have strong attacks in high HP they can overwhelm their opponent Pokemon without needing to rely on GX attacks the extra power comes at a price when a pokémon GX is knocked out the opponent will take two prize cards so the player will need to decide strategically when to use them and finally legendary Pokemon the legendary pokemon soul gay leo and luna la who appear on the cover of Pokemon Sun and Moon video games will be featured in Pope in Sun and Moon expansions as pokémon GX so gay Leo will have the sole burst GX attack which will allow players to attach five energy cards from their deck to their Pokemon in any way they like making the power of powerful attack that is useful for super energy acceleration and LU nala will have the lunar fall GX attack which lets players immediately knock out any of their opponents basic pokemon that sounds way better than so gaily has put that's going back to that old um who's the guy with the forearms Wow my mention working yeah that one my champ that would immediately knock out any basics yeah and a basic pokemon could be like technically i don't i don't if most the exes are still legal but Mewtwo DX which is 180 HP which was one of the most popular cards ever like that's technically considered a basic pokemon you exciting things for the TCG I don't as somebody who was very competitive in the TCG for two years I don't know if this would be something that would bring me back it just doesn't seem all that appealing it just if you draw your GX and you set up your GX first you have the immediate advantage and if you can't pull that GX out it just seems like you're you're instantly at a disadvantage but you can hold your ball for a GX come on stop complaining one thing I will say is whenever they have a major set up date so like right there moving into the sun and moon sets that's if you're considering getting into the TCG that's always a good time to get into it because that means that you know the and nobody's going to have these cards and it is completing a completely new mechanic so it's going to shake up the meta a lot or it should so then it's a you'll kind of be on a more even footing with people have been playing for a long time right yeah it's interesting that's that's that's it ah Travis I just wanted to throw some Pokemon names out there see if you have any thoughts you know there's Pokemon going around like wishy washy or a low in me out or a low and raichu or a lone marowak or you want me to go in that order I mean any order uh we just haven't heard your thoughts on them or the the pukey pukey can't remember its name Yuki Yuki that one's weird so wishy-washy I think the idea is the schooling ability is cool I laughed really hard when the trailer said get schooled by wishy washy yeah that made me laugh a lot I'm curious to see if the ability acts in game as its implied where it sort of implied that wishy washy doesn't evolve but instead at a certain level just becomes a stronger Pokemon and is that's represented by a bunch of wishy washy gathering other it's kind of strange seems like you would just make an evolution for it but I guess that'll make more sense when we play the game other than that I think wish you watch it just looks like a fish alone meows is awesome I think it's one of the Pokemon where it's official art kind of betrays how cool it looks in game I think the footage we've seen of a lowland mouth a lowland Meowth animated in the game is where that character design really shines of playing out the the sassiness I guess is that where people used to describe it or the the playfulness of of this version of me out let's see what was next and I like me out generally as people probably already know so another version of it that's even sassier and takes even a less flak from nerds is amazing um lulling the ride to and alone marowak all and raichu is cool its eyes scare me a little they're a little too bright um this is like extremely bright eyes if I remember correctly right yeah I think its cool the electric psychic is an interesting combination that we haven't really seen before and I like the electric terrain doubling its speed ability Electric surfer or something free what the abilities called but that's what it does that could actually make I mean I don't know that it really will come into play but giving that sort of forgotten arena effect of electric terrain a little more to do is cool hello and marowak is cool i think the fire um what do you call those the jugglers who juggle with flaming I feel like doing my throwers or whatever um I think that's a cool way to adapt that design and believe they're called jugglers really just Bob Douglas yes there's not a special word for when the thing they're juggling is on fire I think there is I don't think so better jugglers I think it's cool that they gave it a ghost-type to what else is there uh I'm not gonna do all of them I'll just throw another couple your way minor or Okoro and won the mini or the meteor guy yeah I think I think that's really cool I think it's really cute how you don't know what color it's gonna be till it's hurt and then it's like oh I'm in this in this color media work anymore but it's a mini meat-eor I think that's really neat the other one was the bird thing that changes forms right yeah with the four different types of dancing that one doesn't do much for me I think it's cool that as different forms but the design of it is a little strange to me I don't know it isn't that aesthetically appealing to me um ah we have mud Bray which is the my little pony Pokemon male side huh I love an executory oh I haven't talked about a little and executory yet the thing is a metal of how excited you get also I think a lot of people over on the screen I think a lot of people overlook this but it's grass dragon yes it is it is very much grass dragon and that's wild why mega Sceptile is also grass dragon yeah but right but at least I was not so hot at least mega Sceptile you can kind of understand that it has some dragon like aspects to it Lowell and execute or is more like mega Ampharos words oh yeah it's a dragon now too it doesn't look like it but it is and you're just gonna have to deal with that and i find that great trying to see if there's any other interesting ones i'm sure people are mad that like why haven't you talked about this or that ah but yeah i'm not seeing any unless there was something that stood out to you i mean i could say like oh one ball pics nine tails thank you like we have we technically didn't talk about those with you but I like alone Sam shrew and sand / more than I like hole and vulpix um nine tails for what that's worth what do you think of a little and oddish that's not a real thing we'd only revealed to me but I mean it'll be in the game but Pokemon company is only revealed it to me I said works when it your dad works for a Nintendo mm-hmm my dad's been gone for a long time but I'm sorry what one of my close relatives works for Nintendo when he told me that there's going to be a fire grass a little an ollie oddish and it's gonna be awesome I think you're close relative is full of garbage car boater hmm finally before we move on to our Pope one of the week yeah lowland garb odor is fairy type okay go on that would be I'm I'm sold you have an in Game Freak you tuning in Travis are you gonna buy yourself a Z ring no why would I do that so you can wear it so it can light up when you're going so i can light up and vibrate and play a song along with the video and sound and the game it will be available at for sale at participating retailers i'm sure it will remind yourself that you're talking to the person who is never bought a second console because it's limited edition or i don't i don't really care a lot about the bells and whistles wait what was that unless they're like built it and let's they're like already built into the game like the pokewalker i think is one of the greatest i was gonna just ask what your thoughts on the pokewalker were because you were given that it's not like a do wasn't like a choice right i think i think it's great because it's it adds functionality it's a game of its own you can take with you it didn't increase the price any it still it was still the same standard price for a DS game at the time and yeah and it wasn't sold separately so I'm so if I was going to get the game I had to get it and it was already cool I don't think the C ring is that cool yeah I don't think I don't think it's gonna do much for me I think I'm so gonna get it cuz i feel like i would have to talk about it I don't know like I get why it's not with the game because obviously they're gonna sell a billion of these because yokai watch and they're just riding that those coattails but a part of me is a little disappointed that it's not included with the game when in the past we've gotten like the wireless connector with firered and leafgreen we got the pokewalker with heart gold soul silver and I can't imagine this little device cost that much or really what it literally what it says is it will light up and vibrate and play a sound and that's pretty much the extent have you got a phone and I can do those things all right so as we are recording this the world championships are wrapping up in recent years we don't really cover the winners or losers of that event they exist there's quickly forgotten about unless they are the the champion themselves well did you want to talk about you probably watch more than the the out of the three of us you probably watched the most of that egg didn't watch that I'm not too tight I mean I did spend some time yesterday because I was doing some work at home and I had that up on the TV while I was watching to start with something positive I really really enjoyed that say John Park which is the former VGC world champion from Korea was playing the trading card game and obviously had gotten a world's invite and was actually doing well I saw him win around in the trading card game so I was like it would be really cool if he is the world champion in the trading card game as well and then he could be the first person ever to get the audio game and the trading card game titles um and he's really nice just it just comes across it he's a really nice person so that was really cool to say something bad I wish that Pokemon had structured the programming a little bit better because the majority of the stream was either just the casters as they call them or the commentators talking about the games or breaks and not as many games as I would like to see and I think that they've just they've done it better in the past where they really went from game to game to game and there weren't these like huge gaps between actually seeing any of the action in the games and then to end with something nice as as we do in the professional world they have added the prize cam for the TCG s so you can see what a player has prized even though they don't know what it is and that's really really cool it really like gives the it boosts the way that they do the TCG coverage in such a way that's like absolutely amazing yes that was that was first debuted at Nationals so they they this is the second time they've been using the price cams so that was that was enjoyable I mean overall it's it's been good you know obviously the BGC as disappointing as ever because we're still in the same format with so many legendaries and you know all the teams pretty much our revolving down to grout on xerneas so that's that's not as much fun but there is a lot of hope in the community now that the next series will be a lolla pokemon only and no legendaries so it'll be back to like 2011 which was the unova pokemon only series and that'll be a lot of fun bring some originality back into the market I would consider playing again if they did a gen 7 Pokemon only like they did for Gen 5 although because it makes sort of a more level playing field for if you haven't played in the past year or so things sort of get wiped but I find that unlikely given that Jen 7 as with jen 6 has strong ties to previous generations with like a lowland pokemon and that sort of thing I mean it could be just jen seven decks only yeah that would I would I would certainly play if that were the case well I shouldn't say sir certainly it depends on my schedule but I would can I would consider it I would probably make a team at least if not actually go anywhere how they may have a new pentagon rule as well so that it has to be grow bread or caught in a lola region so yeah ya know then that was cool for X&Y I watched the open opening ceremonies of the stream I believe it at least my time it started 1155 a.m. and it went for almost 35 minutes before we saw the missile hi miss Ohio I think she was Miss nuttin Nevada I can't remember I can't remember who the the folks person who came out on stage they just won a version of Miss America do you remember the breeding their Twitter profile because everyone in the slack was like who is chick that has come out wearing a blazer and a Pokemon 20th anniversary shirt and she clearly read off the teleprompter quite a bit and then some people that worked at pokemon came out they showed a cry baller and then they started their live stream of games and I have to say though the the 35 minutes leading up to that was incredibly boring and extremely long-winded it was a lot of conversation going back and forth of well you know we have a lot of champions here that you know the it's anyone's game they could they could just win it again because they're so good and then there was a lot of conversation going you know this is a game where you can just start playing this year and you could instantly win and and come up and be an underdog and completely contradicting each other and they repeated that conversation back and forth for 35 minutes and to me obviously Pokemon is they upped their prize pool and they changed it from you know you don't need to claim a scholarship you can actually just claim the money there were articles recently of Pokemon you know becoming this Big East sport and it was funny because Joe from sarah b and I had a little Twitter conversation because Joe tweeted what may I don't get the recent changes what makes it in eSport now a paired compared to what it was before and i responded just more money and that was pretty much the consensus of yep the only difference here is there's more money at stake and now people are finally considering it a quote-unquote real East board because there's just more money there and so for me watching the the stream and I didn't watch a lot of it mostly because I I just don't care that much about watching it's almost like a sport like when I was at worlds when I was at Nationals it was absolutely fun to sit in that audience and sit in that crowd and watch and at the time when I was at Worlds I was with a friend who didn't know anything about Pokemon and it was very cool to see him get excited over something that he didn't know that much about and also asked questions about what was going on that was at the time that was black and white only so like when zip striker used to move and everyone cheered it was very cool to see him like why are they cheering like why is this in an important move and it was just like okay like this move only has you know eighty percent accuracy and the sandstorm is going which lowers it I'm just giving a scenario it's not right at all but I just breaking down of why that was an exciting play and that was really cool and III think with sports and stuff like that I I'm sure I'm not a sports person but I'm sure people would argue that going to see a football game in real life is more exciting than seeing it on TV or seeing a soccer game or seeing a baseball game and and I feel I definitely have that effect when it comes to pokemon I think that being there in the the audience is just way more exciting feeling that energy but going back to the commentators it was just boring and I think it suffered from that and I definitely was not the only one in the slack because we had a slack channel dedicated the world's and a lot of other people were like this is really kind of boring like you could have easily made this segment 10 minutes and then go on to the opening ceremonies I don't know why they needed to talk for 30 minutes but what I would like to see in the future of these streams is for Pokemon to pick 10 or 12 people and follow their journey I want them to sit down with these people on with them to interview them before worlds or even before nationals and make video packages of them I think it's hard do it's hard for somebody who doesn't follow the video game that doesn't follow the trading card game to watch these streams and to pick somebody they want to root for and if you if you don't if you don't have somebody you want to root for it's hard for that to keep your interest and my final point is it's something silly and Travis is going to roll his eyes but I think that if you look at how WWE does this and how wrestling does this is obviously you know all the wrestling matches the outcome is pretty determined in everything but what they do before the matches and they do this a lot and they they show a lot of replays is they give you a story of why to care about which wrestler you want to win so they do these two to three-minute video packages of here's this wrestler story here's this wrestler story here's why they're fighting here's what's on the line all right now the match is going to start if you didn't have that before the match and somebody is new sitting down to wrestling and they don't know who to root for they're probably just not going to watch it they're not just they just don't hair and with Pokemon you have at least the advantage of okay this boat this person has some of my favorite pokemon on their team that's cool or this person's from America and this person for Brazil I'm from America so I'm going to root for the American but Pokemon is already walking around the show floor interviewing fans and asking what their favorite Pokemon was or when they started playing and those video packages could use a little bit of work but I think just like in sports people care about certain players they care about the Tom Brady's and the Brett Favre's and the Michael Jordan's these are only the sports people i know this is how bad my sports knowledge is but they care about those people so when so to see a person have a journey through okay like you only made it to Nationals through Last Chance Qualifier now you're going on two worlds I want to hear that story I want to have a person like that that I could care about that I could be invested in their journey instead of oh well you know this guy's been to all these Nationals and Harry is playing is a really good player let me repeat that eight more times throughout the match like that just doesn't do it for me I know a lot of other large it will the larger eSport seems try to do that I don't follow I never really followed League of Legends the pro scene there but for the short period of time where I played it myself one of the world tournaments or whatever they call the finals for that game i think they call it worlds was happening what happened to be playing it so i watched it and they try to do that there they have they tell you about the teams and they tell you about where they come from and and like who is the rookie on the team who's been there for a very long time to give you that context to understand early to give you a nugget of a reason to root for one person over the other and I think that it and I don't know how successful that is in doing what I'm about to say but I would imagine that that kind of storytelling helps people not only like us who are already invested in Pokemon because we love it and we love well done already what I would say room god I can't string a sentence together I always say we are already invested in competitive Pokemon as people who I mean it's been years for most of us um but people who've already participated in that so where we already are bought in but I think you need that type of story line to get someone who likes pokemon but doesn't necessarily love the competitive aspect to it to have any interest in in watching competitive play they they have to build those storylines I mean I don't have any like solid evidence that that works but I can't imagine being interested in it unless you sell that's type of narrative well actually a lot of there are a lot of people in our slack community who have never played competitive Pokemon and they were fascinated by the world's coverage just interesting to see how the games are played yep yeah yeah yeah i mean i can see that side of the fence but to me the coverage has been pretty much identical year up for a year true i can't comment i was gonna say i actually think that this year's has degraded a little bit i think past years has actually had better coverage just because they had better between the matches information and they had more matches up on the screen more rapidly I just I don't know what happened this year that that they haven't been able to accomplish that I would just love to see more more vignettes more player coverage even like when they're asking people questions like that's great the the thing that always turned me off is when you see those video packages of questions that questions it's like the same eight people they just ask them all three different questions and then cut that into three different video packages you're like they're 10,000 20,000 people here you could made these video packages quickly but you could easily just took the time and interviewed a couple more people and just had some more variety here but I mean that's it they clearly can edit and put out well made video packages quickly like they've definitely done that so I don't know if they need one or two more people to make even more video packages but if you're doing a three-day weekend and you're only replaying three different video packages that over and over and then you're blocking out 40 minutes for an intermission like that's not good coverage and I think we'll to answer your question of what do they need to do differently when they're already doing a lot I would just say that it VGC has been around for what seven years or something like that longer than that well the well hasn't been around super long it is it's fairly new but it's less than a decade i'm pretty sure yeah at least worlds was i can look that up but yeah continue your point but i was going to say it's not that new but it feels every year like that i mean they will constantly be the underdogs there's no chance that unless the game itself changes radically you're not going to have a robust competitive scene on the scale of something like a starcraft 2 in its heyday or league of legends or whatever world coverage for the video game started in 2009 at san diego so exactly seven years started with pokemon platinum was the first game that had competitive coverage and the BCG started in 2004 with the expedition and e x hidden legend set so I guess what I'm saying is you've had seven years it shouldn't feel like it it shouldn't feel like constantly every year that Pokemon is this struggling up-and-comer it seems like you would have it figured out by your seven I mean I realize it's not gonna be the hugest thing but it seems like you'd have the execution of it down so that you could start doing the type of experimentation that Steve is suggesting as opposed to focusing on just the minimum execution I don't know well but they're video streaming of the competition's only started in two 12 yeah it was the first year that they had a stream so it's only been four years for them so I'll give them one more year so 2017 they need to get the three of us first of all you must need to be there providing color commentary maybe not the competitive commentary but we can be better bright and cheerful faces than Miss Ohio or whoever she is who actually doesn't know anything about Pokemon I didn't see that part of the ceremony so I have nothing to say no no no she she is doing all of the post competition interviews of the people of the okay I know here talking about yeah and I mean well number one that'll step it up because people will be laughing a heck of a lot more than they currently are but yeah I just think that they also can work better at scheduling the matches so that because you know they have four channels they have the main channel that's a little bit of everything they have the trading card channel the VGC channel and then the PO contains channel and they could literally because they control this event organized the matches so that they know that they will go from a trading card match to a video game match to a pokin match or something like that so that they always have some content going on that main channel and not a 60-minute dinner break absolutely or even like just have a camera up in the ceiling over showing the show floor and have that running for 16 minutes instead of just a animated wallpaper pretty much that's all it was yep I don't know I world is world's could be more exciting obviously this year didn't help that it was not open to the general public we'll see what they do next here and yeah we'll go from there let's wrap this show up we'll noticed a Pokemon being used in the VGC stuff that was kind of uh unique in as usual unusual and so our pokemon of the week this week is arcane 9 Arcanine the legendary pokemon i think that's what the species name is that is correct yep a real solid win from Pokemon there I like the Japanese name uh windy windy that's what is going yep windy that's neat alright our canine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pokemon it is capable of running 6,200 miles within 24 hours yeah me too with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight I just want to say that I looked up how far fiji water comes to Milwaukee and it is 7,200 miles star an Arcanine within 24 hours can almost run from Milwaukee to Fiji in 24 hours me too our canine has long been admired for its beauty and speed and anyone who hears its bark will Bravo before us the source of its power is a is a flame blazing wildly inside it and the anime it was shown that it scratches that its stash stashes food in its main and carries it to its nest for its young our canine lives on prairies and pokemon snap also shown it living in active volcanoes glad we have that Pokemon snapper yeah Gary at an Arcanine apparently that he's the ins Giovanni that's a fact so we'll noticed our canine there was two that made it into the top top 16 I think I pulled right from Pokemon calm at the 2016 world tournament one of them was holding a red card the other was holding a life orb but travis has its own move set that you can use if you care to do so yeah normally I tried to deviate a little bit from something you could just get on a smug on because I mean you can just go on smogon and find the optimal list and sometimes that means I only change one move or two because to be frank that our pokemon that can be used at that there is an optimal way to use them based on the tools they have at their disposal arcanine is a Pokemon however that has so much of a useable move pool well it's it's not huge but it has a lot of different type coverage between stuff like I mean the stab moves like flare blitz and uh well yeah it's only fire type so stab moves like flare blitz or off type moves for coverage like wild charge even close combat and crunch as all those those are all competitively viable moves that has access to in addition to a move that's probably going to be on every arcanine move site which is extreme speed which to those who are unaware is like quick attack where it goes first it has increased priority to be specific also a normal type move but as a base power of 80 which is more significant than quick attacks and as a priority of plus 2 whereas something like quick attack or sucker punch or aqua jet I think sucker punch has only plus 1 don't count on that one but your typical increased priority moves are only priority plus one so if you use extreme speed and your opponent Noozhawk which uses Aquajet even if you're a slower Pokemon you're still going to outspeed that's why I extreme speed is such a great move to have flare blitz and extreme speed are probably going to be on your set regardless of what you're doing unless you're doing something like a special attacking set which isn't impossible but because there's so much you can do other than that you can have I'll just list some of the options even though these are I mean I'm taking these stripe from the smokin article just because we could be here all day trying to figure out what our niche version of this Pokemon that already has decent versatility is or I could just give you some of the options which i think is more beneficial so if you want to go for the defensive route you're still going to want to include Flair bit blitz and extreme speed because there's such powerful moves and they're powerful regardless of whether you invest effort values into attack flare blitz just because of its extremely high base power at 120 and extreme speed because sometimes even as a defensive Pokemon you need to get a little bit of damage in when the opponent's weak without to prevent yourself from taking that extra damage if you're going that defensive route you are going to want to use Morning Sun which is a recovering move that recovers more in sunlight it's fifty percent in normal weather then I believe 75% if it's sunny and then you'll probably want one status effect mode smogon says either will-o-wisp or toxic I think willow wisp is more fun um and you're already going for a sort of physically defensive set given that Arcanine has access to intimidate which is an ability where when it switches in it lowers the opponent's physical attack by one stage so you can double down on that by lowering their physical physical attack further with a burn item i would go with rocky helmet because you're already getting recovery from morning sun so you don't have to worry as much about leftovers and then your they recommend ambush nature and i don't remember what that one is but i'm sure it's fine um they recommend 248 hp8 attack and 252 defense I'm sure the eight attack is there for some niche circumstance where it allows flare blitz to one hit KO some important meta pokemon in their underused tier list so you can probably disregard that if you're just doing it for fun and just do full HP and defense on this defense of our 9 if you're going to go offensive you just do flare blitz extreme speed um and then I like I'm just a fan of wild charge as a move I think it's cool i'm in close combat and then you could either I like choice band they recommend life orb but because you've got extreme speed I think choice band can be extremely powerful as well your ability choice here is up to you if you want something in to switch in on the fire type you might want to do flash fire or intimidate is just a generally great ability all around and then if you're going that that band choice band set because you have extreme speed i would say you still want to go adamant even though you're not going going to outspeed that much because you don't have to worry too much about it because you've got decent natural bulk and that increased priority move so i would go with adamant over gently but that's up to you and then your eb's 252 and attack and speed so there's your two options offensive ND so defensive I feel like get ramble too long but hey now that's alright already like a two hour show so also just to explain for the arcanine that was used in worlds it was holding red card and what red card does is if the Pokemon holding the red card is hit by an attack the attacker is immediately switched out and replaced by a random Pokemon from the opponent's team so I believe the intent there is one of the major threats this year is xerneas and xerneas would have a out be holding a power herb which allows it to use its move geomancy which is a stat boosting move when in one turn rather than two turns which it typically takes so let's say xerneas geo man sees in one turn it uses up its power herb and then if it attacked arcanine it is taken out of battle and it loses those stat boosts and it can't geomancy in one turn again so I've like that helps to be defensive that's cool it it's not it's it's one of those cases where xerneas is such an incredibly and I mean this is I typically give the advice for single battles because I know more about that but from the little i've played VGC 2016 these pokemon that are at the top level are so strong that setting up a pokemon like arcanine as a quote-unquote counter to czar Gnaeus in this case or or when you're trying to set up a counter to grout on or something like that a lot of the time it you have to end up settling for more of a soft counter like like this because if you're building something to be able to easily won at ko for instance these massive powerhouses of Pokemon they probably don't have the versatility to do much else so I imagine that sort of roundabout way of countering Czerny says Gio mansi is because arcanine can do that and also be okay on its own as opposed to I don't know some some steel pipe that out speeds just to get super effective on xerneas or something like bronze i guess like bronze unsure the trivia here that i have is in the pokemon red and blue beta are can't arcanine was originally known as blaze though our canine does not let a legendary pokemon it is seen in a degrading along with legendary pokémon moltres Articuno and zapdos in the anime episode pokemon emergency many of our canines pokedex entries starting with the one in japanese pokemon red references the real world specifically china our canine is based on the Rye Kuen which is a mythical creature inspired by lions tigers and dogs statues of them statues of them in pairs are used as guardians that invite good spirits and repel evil ones yeah that's it for trivia here which is weird the Pokemon so old and it doesn't have that much privia about it if you get a shiny arcanine it is gold instead of the oranges orangish red that it normally has it still keeps its black stripes but that orange color turns to a goldish color which is pretty cool I gotta say though I hate that Arcanine is considered the legendary Pokemon and is not a legendary Pokemon what they didn't know what they were doing in gen 1 yeah well they can fix it they fix other Pokemon on the past go ahead and fix this they ever changed a species name though ah I don't believe don't think so no but hey it's their game they can do what they want they can put a 60 minutes off band on it if they want to yeah I think at this point it's sort of endearing that it's the legendary Pokemon and not a legendary pokemon it's going history to it like the weird stuff with Gandhian in the civilization series were that some underflow error made him very keen on using nuclear weapons it's just something that weird mistake early in a game that then becomes a running joke throughout do you not know about that though I don't like play civ in the original sit so the way that the camera moves civil one or civ to but i think it's the original civilization the way the game handled aggression of various types between civilizations was there they had a value as the number one and it could change over time as the game went on up or down but the different leaders had different values to reflect how they acted in history so for Gandhi who led the Indian civilization and I came they wanted to show the the nonviolent resistance that he advocated so naturally they gave him a zero in nuclear aggression but when he when something would happen in the game that would cause that variable to go lower like maybe he adopted some sort of policy that would make him even less likely to use nuclear weapons the game says okay I can't go below zero so it's an underflow error that causes it to be the maximum maximum gradually that it can be and so all of a sudden Gandhi starts developing nuclear weapons incur like it massive beautiful rapid pace and using them all over the place and so it has since become a running joke some games in the series of haven't referenced it or have made them completely passive but I think even in civ 5 he is very passive throughout the game until nuclear weapons are available and then he starts going for them just as a wink and a nod to that original game that's really cool so here's a crucial question how many cats is one arcanine oh I would probably say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 I would probably say 14 cats 7 cats 7 now six foot three tall board honey cats how many cats do you think I am I'm not 14 cat well I'm Ali I mean just because he's 6 tall doesn't mean that he still doesn't have the booty ah and the booty is stopped at least four cats all right all right hop this the tail is at least to look at that thing all right fine I will concede 14 cats cats Travis is at the travis w on twitter trying to run away from you talking about all kinds booty one that's a show become i leave for a few my god well as at wash in the sink i am at dragging a lake if you haven't done so already please leave us review and
