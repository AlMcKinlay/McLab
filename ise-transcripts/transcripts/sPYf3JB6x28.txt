a pokemon podcast surprise and we have a (2:16 - 2:26)
show for you guys we have first off some (2:22 - 2:29)
news our middle segment we'll be talking (2:26 - 2:31)
about the five new pokemon that have (2:29 - 2:34)
been shown since the last episode (2:31 - 2:36)
and then we have a Pokemon of the week (2:34 - 2:38)
and if time permits we will do emails (2:36 - 2:40)
but last couple episodes been almost two (2:38 - 2:42)
hours long so the only reason we keep (2:40 - 2:44)
cutting emails because emails would (2:42 - 2:46)
probably bring every episode 23 hours (2:44 - 2:49)
not that anyone might be might be (2:46 - 2:51)
against that but Travis gets real cranky (2:49 - 2:54)
passes yes unfair Sunday bedtime if we (2:51 - 2:57)
run too long it's Sunday bedtime of two (2:54 - 3:00)
o'clock in the afternoon how do i (2:57 - 3:02)
usually wake up again beauty sleep (3:00 - 3:04)
that's yeah and i usually wake up and (3:02 - 3:06)
start recording so i miss breakfast and (3:04 - 3:07)
lunch and i usually eat lunch (3:06 - 3:09)
immediately after this so sometimes I (3:07 - 3:11)
get cranky because I'm hungry before we (3:09 - 3:13)
dive into pokemon stuff will how was (3:11 - 3:16)
your week I mean it's okay i'm still (3:13 - 3:19)

what's new it's been two weeks now since (3:33 - 3:37)
you were last on but something's right (3:35 - 3:38)
because I was on the last one and then (3:37 - 3:40)
the week well then the week before we (3:38 - 3:43)
played the Kickstarter Kickstarter (3:40 - 3:44)
special so it's been like three weeks (3:43 - 3:49)
st. same old same old overwatch season (3:44 - 3:52)
ended installed the PTR patch so i could (3:49 - 3:54)
play start playing competitive season 2 (3:52 - 3:57)
before it's really out playing a lot of (3:54 - 3:58)
diva even though i don't think the (3:57 - 4:00)
character is very interesting it's the (3:58 - 4:03)
only character i'm good at solid I (4:00 - 4:06)
always liked zenyatta zenyatta is very (4:03 - 4:09)
very awesome and in fact is quite good (4:06 - 4:11)
well they buffed him or sorry they (4:09 - 4:13)
nerfed him slightly in the newest patch (4:11 - 4:15)
and I'm not sure how that's going to (4:13 - 4:17)
shake out i think i'll still be used but (4:15 - 4:20)
previous to the newest patch that's on (4:17 - 4:23)
the public test realm zenyatta was (4:20 - 4:25)
incredibly powerful and was in every (4:23 - 4:28)
single composition that's cool well in (4:25 - 4:31)
my neck of the woods Thank everything I (4:28 - 4:34)
have it is related back to pokemon i (4:31 - 4:37)
think been playing some monster hunter (4:34 - 4:39)
we talked about that or at least will (4:37 - 4:41)
did but i've also been playing monster (4:39 - 4:43)
hunter well you guys had like a mega (4:41 - 4:45)
monster hunter meet up last night didn't (4:43 - 4:48)
you I wouldn't say was mega we had six p (4:45 - 4:49)
people though it was like a hundred (4:48 - 4:52)
messages in skype yeah which is nice (4:49 - 4:53)
because we were able to break off into (4:52 - 4:56)
two groups of three so some people were (4:53 - 4:58)
hunter rank one and they were able to (4:56 - 5:02)
increase our hunter rank and then myself (4:58 - 5:05)
Logan and Jack were all wanting to get (5:02 - 5:09)
the gore set so we hunted that four or (5:05 - 5:12)
five times yes I was a pretty progress (5:09 - 5:15)
filled monster hunter night otherwise my (5:12 - 5:19)
week has also been dedicated to cleaning (5:15 - 5:22)
up and still putting out podcast there (5:19 - 5:24)
was a lot of podcasts that I had still (5:22 - 5:27)
from gencon one of them being the (5:24 - 5:30)
dungeons and dragon knights special that (5:27 - 5:32)
we recorded at gencon him the first (5:30 - 5:36)
episode just went up last night and that (5:32 - 5:38)
is a three or four part series i can't (5:36 - 5:41)
remember exactly how many we recorded (5:38 - 5:44)
but whether it's three or whether it's (5:41 - 5:47)
for it's a it's contained in in that (5:44 - 5:48)
amount and so you're gonna get off (5:47 - 5:51)
you're gonna get a side story from (5:48 - 5:53)
season one and you don't actually have (5:51 - 5:55)
to listen to season one if season one (5:53 - 5:57)
was a turn off or you just didn't like (5:55 - 6:00)
where the story was going this has some (5:57 - 6:02)
of the same characters and some of the (6:00 - 6:05)
new ones and i think uh maybe Travis can (6:02 - 6:07)
help me out here but I think the first (6:05 - 6:09)
episode kind of established who everyone (6:07 - 6:12)
was pretty quickly what kind of (6:09 - 6:13)
personalities they were yeah I just (6:12 - 6:16)
listened to it today it said it seems (6:13 - 6:19)
like a fun light-hearted group to of (6:16 - 6:21)
characters to join on this little side (6:19 - 6:24)
mission yeah oh yeah and Anna I would (6:21 - 6:27)
say that my character Wendy from season (6:24 - 6:29)
one would be very pleased at how often (6:27 - 6:32)
you talked about her well she know she'd (6:29 - 6:33)
be very pleased that you were still (6:32 - 6:36)
thinking about her I was going to say I (6:33 - 6:37)
listened to the whole thing this morning (6:36 - 6:40)
and I mean obviously I was in the room (6:37 - 6:42)
when you guys were recording it but I (6:40 - 6:44)
wasn't really paying attention to you (6:42 - 6:48)
guys I think k in not doing any kind of (6:44 - 6:51)
acting at all but just being himself (6:48 - 6:55)
it's absolutely hilarious oh we made me (6:51 - 6:59)
laugh so much hey as a Troy yeah okay II (6:55 - 7:01)
just in person he's like (6:59 - 7:03)
such a super polite person and that (7:01 - 7:05)
comes across in the way that he's (7:03 - 7:09)
playing its character it just makes me (7:05 - 7:14)
laugh oh wow yeah it's if you haven't (7:09 - 7:16)
you haven't listened to it and I maybe (7:14 - 7:18)
most of you haven't because it literally (7:16 - 7:20)
just went up last night the cool thing (7:18 - 7:21)
about it is because it was recorded in (7:20 - 7:24)
Gen Con all seven of us were sitting in (7:21 - 7:26)
the same room at the same table and so (7:24 - 7:28)
you can really kind of get that feel (7:26 - 7:30)
from it where sometimes when you record (7:28 - 7:32)
a podcast over Skype or the internet or (7:30 - 7:34)
however you do it sometimes there's a (7:32 - 7:37)
disconnect or things don't come out as (7:34 - 7:39)
naturally or as smoothly as they they (7:37 - 7:41)
can and that's obviously what editing's (7:39 - 7:43)
for and even this podcast was heavily (7:41 - 7:46)
edited just because of Mike noises and (7:43 - 7:47)
because of instances where one person (7:46 - 7:49)
talks over the other just like this yeah (7:47 - 7:51)
but yeah it was edited I think it turned (7:49 - 7:53)
out well the first episodes about an (7:51 - 7:55)
hour so if you're looking for power if (7:53 - 7:57)
you're looking for more Pokemon content (7:55 - 8:00)
and you like D&D maybe you're just (7:57 - 8:02)
unsure by Cindy I would definitely give (8:00 - 8:06)
it a chance very easy to find on Google (8:02 - 8:08)
Play or iTunes or wherever you're (8:06 - 8:09)
listening to this podcast you'll be able (8:08 - 8:11)
to listen to dungeon dragon knights just (8:09 - 8:13)
search for pkmn cast or just search for (8:11 - 8:15)
dungeons and dragon i'ts and you should (8:13 - 8:17)
be able to find it still really proud of (8:15 - 8:19)
how that turned off and then episode 2 (8:17 - 8:22)
of that should be up within a week with (8:19 - 8:24)
the same kind of treatment and care I (8:22 - 8:28)
think I think you okay go ahead boy (8:24 - 8:29)
we're just gonna talking over each other (8:28 - 8:32)
these guys are pretty good at nap Oh (8:29 - 8:34)
something in the air it's probably my (8:32 - 8:35)
fault I haven't been here in three weeks (8:34 - 8:37)
or whatever I think it's fair to say (8:35 - 8:40)
that the amount of Pokemon content (8:37 - 8:42)
varies between episode to episode of (8:40 - 8:44)
dungeons and dragon i'ts too so if you (8:42 - 8:46)
listen to one and you think oh there (8:44 - 8:48)
wasn't enough Pokemon in there in fact i (8:46 - 8:50)
think the the introductory episode of (8:48 - 8:55)
the gencon special has next to no actual (8:50 - 8:57)
pokemon content because just learning (8:55 - 9:01)
about the characters but pokemon show up (8:57 - 9:04)
in encounters and they show up as allies (9:01 - 9:07)
and that sort of thing so it's always (9:04 - 9:08)
cool to have this fantasy setting that's (9:07 - 9:11)
injected with that pokemon flavor yeah (9:08 - 9:13)
and I was going to say I think Steve you (9:11 - 9:15)
put a lot more (9:13 - 9:17)
musical cues a lot more thought into (9:15 - 9:20)
musical cues in so that's really (9:17 - 9:23)
entertaining in this little short short (9:20 - 9:25)
one yeah cool yeah I wanted to make sure (9:23 - 9:29)
that I don't know what what the word (9:25 - 9:30)
would be but just kind of add more flair (9:29 - 9:33)
to the episode without overdoing it and (9:30 - 9:34)
Travis and I talked about them before (9:33 - 9:36)
the show and he said that it was just (9:34 - 9:37)
the right amount so I'm glad that that (9:36 - 9:40)
worked out okay tonight's kinase to make (9:37 - 9:42)
this a delicious sandwich can I say one (9:40 - 9:44)
negative thing yes that you can do (9:42 - 9:46)
nothing about but that I noticed (9:44 - 9:49)
incredibly uh you can't hear the dice (9:46 - 9:54)
rolls yeah yeah that is I thought I also (9:49 - 9:56)
thought about adding in dice rolls after (9:54 - 9:58)
the fact but then I was like now that (9:56 - 10:01)
might sound like we're trying to imply (9:58 - 10:05)
something uh or like takes take away the (10:01 - 10:08)
genuineness of it and I was like well (10:05 - 10:11)
now like just trusted the dicer being (10:08 - 10:14)
rolled I was surprised how focused those (10:11 - 10:17)
mics were they were they were dynamic (10:14 - 10:19)
mic so you really have to be looking (10:17 - 10:21)
straight at them to talk it definitely (10:19 - 10:22)
worked because when you rolled the dice (10:21 - 10:23)
you didn't really hear them because they (10:22 - 10:26)
weren't exactly in front of the mic it (10:23 - 10:27)
King or any dice rolls but you can (10:26 - 10:31)
certainly hear those police sirens those (10:27 - 10:34)
might have been artificially drafted ah (10:31 - 10:38)
wait what yeah oh cuz you responded you (10:34 - 10:40)
responded to ones you heard in real life (10:38 - 10:43)
correct but then the microphones didn't (10:40 - 10:45)
pick them up yes and that joke is (10:43 - 10:47)
probably reacted to them so you got it (10:45 - 10:49)
yeah and the jokes used at least one (10:47 - 10:52)
more time in a later episode because the (10:49 - 10:55)
police kept going by yes there the (10:52 - 10:58)
police did keep going by that's kind of (10:55 - 11:00)
cool that the police sounds fooled you (10:58 - 11:04)
guys I was listening in thinking that is (11:00 - 11:06)
bizarre how loud that is considering (11:04 - 11:08)
their setup but I was I did not even (11:06 - 11:11)
consider for one moment that you added (11:08 - 11:14)
them in yeah yeah there's also like a (11:11 - 11:18)
chicken sound I edge yeah obviously I (11:14 - 11:19)
mean you don't have a chicken in the (11:18 - 11:23)
room no no not I mean maybe we did maybe (11:19 - 11:26)
I mean it alright let's jump into some (11:23 - 11:28)
Pokemon news (11:26 - 11:31)
throw some Pokemon go news Pokemon go (11:28 - 11:34)
player tries getting a million XP and a (11:31 - 11:38)
day gets treated like a cheater that's a (11:34 - 11:40)
good headline right as for Pokemon go is (11:38 - 11:42)
concerned only cheaters should be able (11:40 - 11:44)
to get massive amounts in XP of XP in a (11:42 - 11:47)
short amount of time Jimmy D is a hard (11:44 - 11:49)
can't say his last name so I'm just (11:47 - 11:51)
gonna say Jimmy D Jimmy D is our (11:49 - 11:53)
hardcore Pokemon go player who spent (11:51 - 11:56)
much of the last couple weeks devising (11:53 - 11:59)
an ingenious plan to a cure as much HP (11:56 - 12:03)
XP sorry as humanly possible earlier (11:59 - 12:04)
this month he managed to find a way to (12:03 - 12:07)
get a million XP over the course of the (12:04 - 12:10)
reason the weakened oh man I'm just not (12:07 - 12:12)
reading well today the reason internet (12:10 - 12:15)
commenters kept alleging that it should (12:12 - 12:17)
be impossible to get that much XP (12:15 - 12:19)
without cheating and Jimmy D wanted to (12:17 - 12:22)
prove everyone wrong this weekend d (12:19 - 12:25)
turned up up a notch by devising a (12:22 - 12:28)
special walking route through austin (12:25 - 12:32)
texas this is his ingenious plan number (12:28 - 12:35)
one never make the lat though never make (12:32 - 12:37)
a lap last more than five minutes number (12:35 - 12:39)
two never stop and catch unless there (12:37 - 12:41)
are more Pokemon at your current node (12:39 - 12:44)
number three take breaks at one and (12:41 - 12:46)
three and then reverse the direction (12:44 - 12:49)
frequently and number four minimize lap (12:46 - 12:52)
distance whenever possible I and there (12:49 - 12:55)
is a map of 1 through 10 of polka stops (12:52 - 12:58)
that he is walking to this is by this (12:55 - 13:00)
article's off kotaku by the way what he (12:58 - 13:03)
ended up doing is we placed in game (13:00 - 13:05)
leurs at 10 polka stops at a point 2 (13:03 - 13:08)
mile loop which plan to walk over and (13:05 - 13:11)
over people called it Jimmy's loop the (13:08 - 13:13)
plan at the time was to get a million XP (13:11 - 13:14)
in a single day to prove the channel (13:13 - 13:17)
challenges legitimate see he was also (13:14 - 13:18)
going to livestream the entire event on (13:17 - 13:20)
Twitch with the help of the friends who (13:18 - 13:23)
were able who were also undertaking the (13:20 - 13:25)
challenge news broke out hundreds of (13:23 - 13:26)
people showed up on Twitch to watch the (13:25 - 13:28)
undertaking and according to facebook a (13:26 - 13:30)
thousand people said they were going to (13:28 - 13:33)
join in the festivities in person as (13:30 - 13:35)
well everyone wanted to see if d's plan (13:33 - 13:38)
actually worked no matter what he did or (13:35 - 13:40)
will poke one he put while he used every (13:38 - 13:42)
single Monster started running (13:40 - 13:46)
away from d he was triggered pokey (13:42 - 13:48)
triggered Pokemon goes anti-cheating (13:46 - 13:52)
measures after amassing around 600,000 (13:48 - 13:56)
XP through legitimate means knee antic (13:52 - 13:58)
labs recently implemented an anti (13:56 - 14:01)
bottling policy becoming more well known (13:58 - 14:04)
to players as a soft band more or less (14:01 - 14:07)
the policy is a 24-hour cheating (14:04 - 14:08)
prevention tool to stop you from getting (14:07 - 14:12)
more XP than should be possible since (14:08 - 14:15)
release Pokemon go has suffered a strong (14:12 - 14:17)
botting o botting I don't know as a (14:15 - 14:20)
bottling bodying community who have used (14:17 - 14:22)
third-party software to automate playing (14:20 - 14:24)
the game botters were able to occur (14:22 - 14:27)
ridiculous levels and strong pokemon (14:24 - 14:29)
that no one else could making the game (14:27 - 14:32)
unfair in a sense I was trying to prove (14:29 - 14:33)
to natick that their limits were (14:32 - 14:35)
actually hurting players who play (14:33 - 14:38)
efficiently Jimmy said I'm a bit of a (14:35 - 14:40)
hardcore gamer and I play somewhat (14:38 - 14:42)
efficiently but the point is I shouldn't (14:40 - 14:44)
be hitting a 24-hour ban limit in just (14:42 - 14:48)
over a half of that time Jimmy said bots (14:44 - 14:51)
are more efficient than humans are and I (14:48 - 14:53)
think an effective soft man would have (14:51 - 14:55)
been put haphazardly hurting a lot more (14:53 - 14:57)
players than expected the good news is (14:55 - 15:01)
despite the soft band for hours d raised (14:57 - 15:03)
enough money for charity during the live (15:01 - 15:04)
stream that he'll be able to donate the (15:03 - 15:07)
money for a good cause i logged 25 miles (15:04 - 15:09)
using the charity miles and i will be (15:07 - 15:12)
able to donate 50 to 60 dollars to (15:09 - 15:14)
charity thanks to my stream donations we (15:12 - 15:17)
could have easily managed to get five to (15:14 - 15:18)
ten times the amount of donations if (15:17 - 15:21)
there was a full stream closing out (15:18 - 15:23)
Jimmy says I was still able to spin (15:21 - 15:25)
poker stops after getting soft band i (15:23 - 15:28)
also got 25 XP from pokemon running away (15:25 - 15:30)
people laughed on stream because i (15:28 - 15:32)
continued to play for over an hour and a (15:30 - 15:36)
half after getting something like 25,000 (15:32 - 15:38)
experience games are meant to be played (15:36 - 15:41)
and in my opinion played well Jimmy says (15:38 - 15:45)
and just to interpret for our audience (15:41 - 15:51)
occur a cure in SBJ speak is a crew in (15:45 - 15:56)
English I feel like you'd say the word (15:51 - 15:59)
both ways I feel that there's one way to (15:56 - 16:02)
say a crew hey Jimmy what do you do this (15:59 - 16:06)
weekend hey Jimmy what um do anything (16:02 - 16:09)
fun this weekend uh yeah I prove that (16:06 - 16:12)
it's possible to make pokemon go think (16:09 - 16:16)
I'm a robot good job great work it's (16:12 - 16:26)
like a reverse Turing test I couldn't do (16:16 - 16:29)
you guys agree with the what are your (16:26 - 16:33)
thoughts that Jimmy D was soft band not (16:29 - 16:35)
permanently banned just soft band for 24 (16:33 - 16:38)
hours it sounds like what he did was (16:35 - 16:43)
incredibly choreographed so that that (16:38 - 16:45)
would happen I mean he even basically (16:43 - 16:47)
says so that he was trying to get as (16:45 - 16:49)
much exp is was possible in that amount (16:47 - 16:53)
of time and I wonder is there really an (16:49 - 16:55)
epidemic of players being soft band for (16:53 - 16:58)
flying legitimately because they're (16:55 - 17:00)
doing what he's doing or is this just an (16:58 - 17:03)
extreme circumstance of someone trying (17:00 - 17:06)
to find a very small hole in a system (17:03 - 17:09)
and and pointed out it I mean I don't (17:06 - 17:10)
you know I don't know if there are a (17:09 - 17:12)
bunch of people who are experiencing (17:10 - 17:14)
this but to me it sounds like it's not (17:12 - 17:16)
as big of a problem as he's trying to (17:14 - 17:19)
portray it as uh yeah I I don't think (17:16 - 17:21)
it's that big of a problem I think that (17:19 - 17:24)
the only reason this really made news is (17:21 - 17:25)
because it was on twitch and there was a (17:24 - 17:28)
Facebook group and he somewhat promoted (17:25 - 17:31)
it and they gained attention and news (17:28 - 17:33)
media's especially are still grasping (17:31 - 17:35)
onto Pokemon go news because it brings (17:33 - 17:38)
in traffic but I don't know you can jump (17:35 - 17:40)
a lot of levels pretty fast in Pokemon (17:38 - 17:42)
go especially before level 20 and that's (17:40 - 17:45)
a lot of XP and a lot of time but it's (17:42 - 17:48)
not nearly the amount of XP that Jimmy (17:45 - 17:50)
was trying to go for here but I feel (17:48 - 17:53)
like knee antic acknowledged what he was (17:50 - 17:55)
doing I think it would be more (17:53 - 17:59)
frustrating or weirder if niantic didn't (17:55 - 18:01)
say anything and he was just soft band (17:59 - 18:03)
but like he knew he was going to get (18:01 - 18:05)
soft band because he knew that at a (18:03 - 18:07)
certain point in the antic restricts the (18:05 - 18:09)
amount of XP that are coming in to (18:07 - 18:10)
prevent (18:09 - 18:12)
right obviously the restriction is in (18:10 - 18:17)
effect because people made BOTS and the (18:12 - 18:20)
bots were getting over set amount of XP (18:17 - 18:22)
so that's why the soft band is in effect (18:20 - 18:25)
and it seemed like he wanted to prove (18:22 - 18:28)
that yes a single person could get this (18:25 - 18:31)
amount of XP if they did that if they (18:28 - 18:34)
dedicated pretty much 12 or more hours (18:31 - 18:38)
to do something like that right and it's (18:34 - 18:40)
such a focused way to and it's like it's (18:38 - 18:43)
almost like niantic is pushing back and (18:40 - 18:44)
saying you know we made a game that's (18:43 - 18:47)
intended for people to enjoy not for (18:44 - 18:49)
people to turn into a job right because (18:47 - 18:53)
he had to work at it he had to plan a (18:49 - 18:56)
route and like actually like really work (18:53 - 18:58)
really hard at pushing to get all those (18:56 - 19:01)
XP points and that's not how Pokemon go (18:58 - 19:03)
is intended to be played there is no (19:01 - 19:06)
wind condition in Pokemon go you don't (19:03 - 19:08)
get a prize for having like the highest (19:06 - 19:11)
level so you need to chill and just (19:08 - 19:14)
enjoy you don't get press for having all (19:11 - 19:15)
the pokemon either you just don't get (19:14 - 19:18)
anything I don't mean to like I'm not (19:15 - 19:20)
trying to like invalidate his way of (19:18 - 19:22)
playing like he said he enjoys playing (19:20 - 19:26)
games that I at the highest level he can (19:22 - 19:29)
but at the same time I find it strange (19:26 - 19:31)
that he's articulating it as if this is (19:29 - 19:33)
some issue that's plaguing a whole bunch (19:31 - 19:36)
of players that niantic needs to fix (19:33 - 19:39)
when in reality it's a problem for a (19:36 - 19:42)
very very small percentage of players (19:39 - 19:43)
and maybe even that percentage of (19:42 - 19:45)
players is simply people trying to make (19:43 - 19:47)
it happen at that point why not just say (19:45 - 19:50)
hey I'm trying to do something fun this (19:47 - 19:52)
weekend I'm trying to make I'm trying to (19:50 - 19:55)
hit the soft been limit legitimately as (19:52 - 19:59)
opposed to portraying it as like a fault (19:55 - 20:00)
with the game I don't know I forgot (19:59 - 20:04)
about you well I have a friend whose (20:00 - 20:06)
name starts with the letter S I'm not (20:04 - 20:08)
going to get any more explicit than that (20:06 - 20:12)
but this person really does not enjoy (20:08 - 20:15)
any game where there's like no clear (20:12 - 20:18)
winning so I can imagine that that (20:15 - 20:22)
friend would also be as frustrated by (20:18 - 20:23)
such a such a game (20:22 - 20:28)
and expose a similar types of beliefs (20:23 - 20:30)
you know some people could be on the (20:28 - 20:34)
side of the fence where they agree that (20:30 - 20:36)
there should be a soft band at you know (20:34 - 20:40)
600,000 XP which again is a ridiculous (20:36 - 20:42)
amount of XP you would really have to (20:40 - 20:45)
dedicate your entire day to hit that (20:42 - 20:49)
level of XP just like Jimmy D did the (20:45 - 20:51)
other side would you know kind of agree (20:49 - 20:54)
with Jimmy and go he should be able to (20:51 - 20:57)
play and enjoy the game at how he wants (20:54 - 20:59)
if he wants to keep going for the entire (20:57 - 21:02)
14 15 16 hours they should let him but (20:59 - 21:04)
in reality there are a lot of games that (21:02 - 21:09)
put bands or not bands but they throttle (21:04 - 21:11)
the game in some way a game like World (21:09 - 21:13)
of Warcraft or Final Fantasy you can (21:11 - 21:17)
only do this event once every 24 hours a (21:13 - 21:20)
game like destiny the same thing this (21:17 - 21:22)
event only happens for you know this (21:20 - 21:24)
weekend and then you gotta wait an (21:22 - 21:27)
entire weekend again it's you can (21:24 - 21:32)
complain that you hit that soft band but (21:27 - 21:34)
at the end of the day it's still the (21:32 - 21:37)
game company's decision to limit the (21:34 - 21:39)
play and they limit that based on (21:37 - 21:41)
everyone just not you or just not the (21:39 - 21:44)
exceptions like in final fantasy 14 I (21:41 - 21:46)
can only go to the casino and I can only (21:44 - 21:49)
buy three lottery tickets and every (21:46 - 21:51)
ticket gets more expensive if I could (21:49 - 21:52)
complain and say well that's my favorite (21:51 - 21:54)
part of the game I want to keep buying (21:52 - 21:56)
tickets no matter how expensive they get (21:54 - 22:00)
but they don't do that and I maybe I'm (21:56 - 22:01)
the exception and i want to buy more (22:00 - 22:04)
lottery tickets but you know Square Enix (22:01 - 22:07)
isn't going to change the game because I (22:04 - 22:08)
hit the limit of only buying three (22:07 - 22:10)
tickets obviously three tickets and (22:08 - 22:13)
600,000 XP is is drastically different (22:10 - 22:15)
but the comparison can still be made (22:13 - 22:17)
there are other examples of you know you (22:15 - 22:19)
can only do this in a game once every 24 (22:17 - 22:22)
hours or once every 48 hours or it's not (22:19 - 22:26)
like Pokemon go as the first game to (22:22 - 22:29)
restrict how a player plays in a certain (22:26 - 22:31)
amount of time so to put this in terms (22:29 - 22:33)
that our audience can understand how (22:31 - 22:37)
many cats is 600,000 XP how many cats (22:33 - 22:40)
Oh things in cats yeah I would probably (22:37 - 22:45)
say you know a thousand XP per cat so (22:40 - 22:46)
you're you're looking at like sixty (22:45 - 22:49)
thousand cats or six hundred cats yes (22:46 - 22:52)
did I miss an episode where did this (22:49 - 22:54)
joke come from yes you did miss an (22:52 - 22:56)
episode I think we were talkin to the (22:54 - 22:59)
newest one with you and with the two of (22:56 - 23:01)
you and Stephen is that not the lamest (22:59 - 23:06)
yeah I at one point somebody said like (23:01 - 23:08)
how big is that I would and I said oh (23:06 - 23:12)
it's like three cats big and I kept I (23:08 - 23:16)
kept going and afterwards like people on (23:12 - 23:20)
Twitter and in slack we were like they (23:16 - 23:21)
thought that was the funniest thing ever (23:20 - 23:23)
and I didn't think anything of it I just (23:21 - 23:27)
thought like if you like stacked one cat (23:23 - 23:29)
on top of two cats and that was like a (23:27 - 23:31)
shape that would be what we were (23:29 - 23:35)
comparing it to but yeah apparently i (23:31 - 23:37)
measure things based off how many cats (23:35 - 23:39)
would fit into it so wasn't in episode (23:37 - 23:42)
content it was you know it was instead (23:39 - 23:44)
he was well you said it will you said it (23:42 - 23:46)
in an episode but the joke of it was (23:44 - 23:48)
created on yeah it's red you know sure (23:46 - 23:50)
yeah when I said it everyone just kind (23:48 - 23:53)
of accepted that and moved on oh yeah (23:50 - 23:54)
that makes it really gather you to be on (23:53 - 23:57)
this show yeah Pokemon go still exists (23:54 - 24:00)
um I play you know I when I get (23:57 - 24:03)
somewhere I when I get somewhere new I (24:00 - 24:07)
open the app up I check and if there's a (24:03 - 24:08)
focus the really i'm checking for a (24:07 - 24:12)
polka stop there's really not many (24:08 - 24:13)
pokemon that I don't have that would (24:12 - 24:15)
excite me to see maybe if I like I like (24:13 - 24:17)
if some missing like cypher so I i guess (24:15 - 24:18)
i would get excited if there was a (24:17 - 24:21)
scyther but you know I am I don't have (24:18 - 24:24)
the expectation or the the hope that (24:21 - 24:26)
when I randomly opened the app site (24:24 - 24:28)
there would be the one I see that being (24:26 - 24:31)
said I normally open the app when I'm at (24:28 - 24:33)
a new location see if there's a polka (24:31 - 24:35)
stop there or just to see how many polka (24:33 - 24:39)
stops are there and recently I haven't (24:35 - 24:40)
been getting out of the house much (24:39 - 24:42)
though when I go to in my normal places (24:40 - 24:48)
of like Target or McDonald's or woodmans (24:42 - 24:50)
or wherever I normally go (24:48 - 24:52)
oh I don't even bring up the phone (24:50 - 24:53)
anymore because I know that there's (24:52 - 24:55)
nothing there there's no poka stops here (24:53 - 24:58)
my pokemon go has definitely been a lot (24:55 - 25:00)
less but it also doesn't help that it's (24:58 - 25:04)
it's been 96 degrees here in Wisconsin (25:00 - 25:06)
and if you're gonna if I'm going to pick (25:04 - 25:09)
between going outside in 96 degree (25:06 - 25:11)
weather to play pokemon go or sitting (25:09 - 25:13)
inside where it's air conditioning and (25:11 - 25:14)
playing Monster Hunter I think the (25:13 - 25:16)
choice is pretty easy hopefully you know (25:14 - 25:18)
when the weather gets a bit better when (25:16 - 25:20)
it cools off a bit i will definitely go (25:18 - 25:22)
back down i'm not done with pokemon go I (25:20 - 25:25)
I don't dislike Pokemon go it it's just (25:22 - 25:28)
weather plays a big factor in my Pokemon (25:25 - 25:31)
go enjoyment I'm gonna have to ask the (25:28 - 25:33)
question that I'm sure all of our (25:31 - 25:36)
listeners are wondering which is what on (25:33 - 25:39)
earth is Woodman's yeah like in the same (25:36 - 25:42)
thing but I didn't speak up oh my god (25:39 - 25:47)
the Woodman's is a grocery store uh (25:42 - 25:50)
similar to pick and save or uh yet (25:47 - 25:52)
you're gonna have to run that one by me (25:50 - 25:55)
too how I I don't want to say similar to (25:52 - 25:58)
meijer because a Meyer is more of a (25:55 - 26:03)
walmart right so probably like a century (25:58 - 26:06)
that we have krogh of kroger over there (26:03 - 26:08)
no we don't have kroger way no no no so (26:06 - 26:12)
sentry is the real low end yes entrance (26:08 - 26:14)
entries like a grocery store but I tiny (26:12 - 26:17)
grocery store where's the one that we (26:14 - 26:19)
went to when I needed to get like (26:17 - 26:22)
protein bars was that it was like kind (26:19 - 26:24)
of like you had to go through what's (26:22 - 26:26)
that really poor section called that (26:24 - 26:28)
really bad section that we had to drive (26:26 - 26:29)
through and you're like oh you don't (26:28 - 26:30)
wanna live around here and then you (26:29 - 26:32)
cross this line and you're in like (26:30 - 26:33)
Wauwatosa and you're like oh it's really (26:32 - 26:37)
nice here yeah what was it a century no (26:33 - 26:41)
no no it was nice a pic and SAV would (26:37 - 26:43)
many be May it might have been a pig and (26:41 - 26:47)
yeah I I bet it was like one of the (26:43 - 26:50)
fancy pic and saves which is called or (26:47 - 26:52)
it could have been a fancy century (26:50 - 26:55)
because there's one fan tree sent fancy (26:52 - 26:59)
century / pick and save in Wauwatosa (26:55 - 27:01)
what about a Piggly Wiggly do you guys (26:59 - 27:03)
have that I don't but I know what Piggly (27:01 - 27:04)
Wiggly is (27:03 - 27:06)
so I would say that there only three (27:04 - 27:08)
grocery stores in DC so okay i would say (27:06 - 27:11)
that sentry is the low end and then (27:08 - 27:13)
Piggly Wiggly is a step up only because (27:11 - 27:15)
Piggly wigglies are bigger than century (27:13 - 27:17)
that's the only reason it's a step up (27:15 - 27:20)
and then i would say that there's pic (27:17 - 27:24)
and SAV which is the big box shopping (27:20 - 27:27)
area where it's only food and i don't (27:24 - 27:29)
even go to pick and save anymore because (27:27 - 27:31)
i go to meijer but i would argue that (27:29 - 27:34)
pic and SAV has more variety of food but (27:31 - 27:36)
Meyer also has your electronics in your (27:34 - 27:39)
clothes and your household items because (27:36 - 27:40)
it's more of a Walmart and then there's (27:39 - 27:44)
a Woodman's and Woodman's is twice as (27:40 - 27:47)
big as a pic and SAV almost always it's (27:44 - 27:50)
just a huge huge and it's only grocery (27:47 - 27:53)
but the other thing about Woodman's that (27:50 - 27:54)
is great is almost every woodmans i'm (27:53 - 27:56)
pretty sure every Woodman's is 24 hours (27:54 - 28:00)
so if you also Woodman's doesn't take (27:56 - 28:03)
credit card they only take cash and (28:00 - 28:06)
debit card that is sketchy as all (28:03 - 28:12)
get-out so when you go people p ID a (28:06 - 28:15)
Woodman's is closed on almost being (28:12 - 28:19)
sam's club level of like people go to (28:15 - 28:20)
sam's club because they're buying like (28:19 - 28:23)
two months worth of food right if you're (28:20 - 28:24)
going to woodmans you're probably buying (28:23 - 28:26)
like a month's worth of food and I feel (28:24 - 28:27)
like if you're going to pick and save (28:26 - 28:28)
you're probably buying like two weeks (28:27 - 28:30)
worth of food and if you're going to (28:28 - 28:35)
sentry I'm sorry hahahaha just end it (28:30 - 28:41)

while nintendo might not be much (31:54 - 32:00)
directly from pokemon go nintendo is (31:57 - 32:02)
flat-out said they have no ties to (32:00 - 32:04)
pokemon go besides giving the money the (32:02 - 32:07)
franchise's biggest move to smartphones (32:04 - 32:08)
is filling up sales of the game company (32:07 - 32:12)
in key ways and this is a great setup (32:08 - 32:15)
launch for pokemon sun and moon for 3ds (32:12 - 32:18)
this november November eighteenth to be (32:15 - 32:20)
specific didn't say that in the news (32:18 - 32:22)
articles I'm saying that because I feel (32:20 - 32:24)
like I know more than this reporter mr. (32:22 - 32:29)
Pokemon Omega Red well at least the (32:24 - 32:31)
reporter knew that it's Kirby planet (32:29 - 32:34)
robobot I know they got planet robot it (32:31 - 32:38)
he broke planet robot oh that's so sad (32:34 - 32:42)
Kirby planet robot I read this right oh (32:38 - 32:47)
that's not even the right name uh-oh (32:42 - 32:51)
megared what a winner well it's it's (32:47 - 32:53)
really sad to hear that you know (32:51 - 32:54)
Nintendo is obviously going out of (32:53 - 32:56)
business right yeah they should just (32:54 - 32:58)
can't sell systems they should just (32:56 - 33:01)
switch to you know only smart phones (32:58 - 33:04)
because clearly these other three or (33:01 - 33:05)
four year old games that are on top of (33:04 - 33:08)
the charts are clearly not bringing in (33:05 - 33:12)
money the trap is has no comment because (33:08 - 33:14)
he's never played monster hunter it's it (33:12 - 33:16)
sure I'm never one monster on road I've (33:14 - 33:18)
been then I feel like though that this (33:16 - 33:20)
makes sense like when I read this news (33:18 - 33:21)
article when I saw other people (33:20 - 33:25)
reporting on this I the voice in my head (33:21 - 33:28)
was was like this is what we all talked (33:25 - 33:30)
about months ago this is what we talked (33:28 - 33:32)
about when Pokemon go was announced that (33:30 - 33:35)
this is purely obviously Pokemon go is a (33:32 - 33:38)
game but this is a purely marketing (33:35 - 33:41)
strategy to get people interested in (33:38 - 33:42)
pokemon that weren't interested in (33:41 - 33:44)
Pokemon and get (33:42 - 33:47)
them to buy hardware and software from (33:44 - 33:50)
Nintendo granted I think all three of us (33:47 - 33:52)
all three of us didn't think Pokemon go (33:50 - 33:55)
would be a phenom phenom (33:52 - 33:58)
banana it's hard to say just yeah nom (33:55 - 34:03)
nom I don't think I'd you at all who I (33:58 - 34:06)
have I can say it perfectly but Pokemon (34:03 - 34:08)
go we never thought Pokemon go would be (34:06 - 34:13)
a feline the the people who are buying x (34:08 - 34:15)
and y right now the people who are (34:13 - 34:16)
buying Omega Ruby alpha sapphire right (34:15 - 34:18)
now the people who are buying 3 s's (34:16 - 34:22)
right now are not hardcore Pokemon (34:18 - 34:25)
people they are people that because of (34:22 - 34:27)
Pokemon go they are now interested in (34:25 - 34:30)
Pokemon Nintendo the pokemon company (34:27 - 34:33)
they knew exactly what they were doing (34:30 - 34:35)
and it worked and we're seeing it now (34:33 - 34:41)
yep yep no surprise i needed i think (34:35 - 34:45)
it's cool i am i'm glad that pokemon go (34:41 - 34:47)
has led to more people getting into the (34:45 - 34:49)
main series games because so many of (34:47 - 34:51)
those people didn't buy anything after (34:49 - 34:54)
red and blue and then yeah and I (34:51 - 34:55)
decision that made the decision that (34:54 - 34:57)
they that the games aren't worth playing (34:55 - 35:00)
and there's some amazing experiences to (34:57 - 35:02)
be at the series so I'm really glad I (35:00 - 35:04)
think I think x and y are great games (35:02 - 35:07)
when you get a 3d s you can also get red (35:04 - 35:09)
blue and yellow from the eShop those (35:07 - 35:11)
hoke manga transferred in the sun and (35:09 - 35:15)
moon everett everything is everything is (35:11 - 35:17)
coming up milhouse I knew you were gonna (35:15 - 35:19)
save it you know I thought of a (35:17 - 35:22)
different I just you know that worked (35:19 - 35:25)
the best and that's situation alright (35:22 - 35:28)
final news item here before we take a (35:25 - 35:32)
break ah this is from reddit this is one (35:28 - 35:34)
of the subreddits I visit a lot so (35:32 - 35:36)
actually I stumbled upon this (35:34 - 35:40)
unknowingly unwillingly but I I visit (35:36 - 35:44)
our / out of the loop a lot because I (35:40 - 35:45)
for one do not want to be out of the (35:44 - 35:48)
loop when it comes to things at most of (35:45 - 35:49)
the time everything I'm out of the loop (35:48 - 35:52)
I falls into two categories one I don't (35:49 - 35:55)
care or two no three categories one I (35:52 - 35:57)
don't care so I don't read it too oh I (35:55 - 35:58)
already know that that's cool i feel (35:57 - 36:00)
like i'm already and i feel like a cool (35:58 - 36:02)
kid and three I don't know about that (36:00 - 36:06)
let me read it this I hate to say was oh (36:02 - 36:08)
my god I don't know about that let me (36:06 - 36:09)
read it (36:08 - 36:11)
idol the threat is what happened with (36:09 - 36:13)
Pokemon and ash and why people are upset (36:11 - 36:15)
and so when I saw the title of that I (36:13 - 36:18)
went oh my gosh I'm always in the loop (36:15 - 36:21)
for Pokemon how am I out of the loop and (36:18 - 36:24)
what is this about so I clicked on it (36:21 - 36:28)
and the body of thread says I recently (36:24 - 36:30)
subscribe to our / Pokemon subreddit (36:28 - 36:32)
there have been multiple posts and (36:30 - 36:34)
thousands of comments supposedly upset (36:32 - 36:36)
at what has happened except I don't know (36:34 - 36:38)
what has happened and everyone is acting (36:36 - 36:40)
a bit of outrage again this doesn't (36:38 - 36:43)
clear up why people are upset about (36:40 - 36:46)
Pokemon and ash but the most hop aboard (36:43 - 36:48)
a comment clearly points that out (36:46 - 36:51)
routine now here ash had the possibility (36:48 - 36:53)
to finally win the pokémon league for (36:51 - 36:56)
the first time of the entire anime (36:53 - 36:58)
series this was the first time he (36:56 - 37:01)
reached the finals (36:58 - 37:04)
and he lost spoiler by the way I believe (37:01 - 37:08)
this is only aired in japan right now is (37:04 - 37:11)
that correct will I I don't know because (37:08 - 37:13)
I'm having a TV problem but you're (37:11 - 37:16)
probably right the uploaded comment also (37:13 - 37:20)
had a graph of or not a graph but an (37:16 - 37:22)
image of ashes standings which is really (37:20 - 37:25)
great because I I couldn't remember (37:22 - 37:27)
where he placed in previous pokemon (37:25 - 37:30)
league championships and I kind of (37:27 - 37:33)
stopped watching after joto I think but (37:30 - 37:34)
I mean I've watched some of the you Nova (37:33 - 37:36)
and I watched some of the sinnoh but I (37:34 - 37:39)
never watched the whole series I will (37:36 - 37:40)
say though the pokemon league stuff is (37:39 - 37:41)
usually the best stuff in the anime but (37:40 - 37:44)
for our listeners at home in the Kanto (37:41 - 37:46)
series actually let's make this a little (37:44 - 37:50)
bit of a game where how top did you do (37:46 - 37:52)
you guys remember ash placing in canto (37:50 - 37:54)
did he make it to the second round and (37:52 - 37:58)
then he was out let's put it in terms of (37:54 - 38:03)
final two top four top eight top 16 and (37:58 - 38:06)
top 32 I'd say top 32 for canto Travis (38:03 - 38:09)
the dark miasma that haunts me and my (38:06 - 38:11)
dreams has deleted all of those memories (38:09 - 38:14)
from that age so I I honestly could not (38:11 - 38:16)
tell you I I don't have a very good (38:14 - 38:18)
memory for content that I haven't seen (38:16 - 38:20)
in that long neither do i I've cuz I (38:18 - 38:22)
didn't realize that he made the top 16 (38:20 - 38:27)
in canto I believe he wat lost Richie (38:22 - 38:30)
was that it or did he lose to Gary I (38:27 - 38:33)
can't remember I've been a long time (38:30 - 38:36)
it's been a long time in johto which I (38:33 - 38:38)
don't remember that league at all maybe (38:36 - 38:41)
that was roachie uh he lost you made it (38:38 - 38:45)
to the top eight in Hoenn he made it to (38:41 - 38:48)
the top eight in sinnoh he made it to (38:45 - 38:52)
the top four in you Nova will you (38:48 - 38:54)
probably know this you big you know of a (38:52 - 38:56)
fan put me on the spot is gonna say he (38:54 - 38:58)
didn't even go to the you know the (38:56 - 39:00)
league oh he did he did he made top (38:58 - 39:04)
eight at you Nova and in Kalos why (39:00 - 39:06)
people are upset is because he was final (39:04 - 39:09)
two and then he lost I don't know much (39:06 - 39:12)
about the battle itself from screenshots (39:09 - 39:15)
I saw it think it came down to (39:12 - 39:20)
his greninja in ash form versed uh mega (39:15 - 39:25)
Charizard the black and blue one Oh is (39:20 - 39:27)
he playing along yes yes he lost a lon (39:25 - 39:31)
cool what a beautiful wrap up to the (39:27 - 39:35)
mega evolution specials and and this XYZ (39:31 - 39:37)
series coming together that's that's (39:35 - 39:39)
real nice Yeah right right he said a lot (39:37 - 39:40)
and that kind of all clicked with me (39:39 - 39:43)
from what I read for our listeners who (39:40 - 39:45)
is a lime and you seemed really excited (39:43 - 39:47)
that ash lost to him well Ilan is the (39:45 - 39:49)
protagonist of the mega evolution (39:47 - 39:52)
specials so if you've watched those then (39:49 - 39:55)
he's the guy who's traveling around (39:52 - 39:57)
trying to learn about mega evolution he (39:55 - 39:59)
used to be one of Professor sycamores (39:57 - 40:01)
assistance but then he decided to pursue (39:59 - 40:04)
his own journey and he's kind of funded (40:01 - 40:06)
by Lysander and in his journey to find (40:04 - 40:08)
out more about mega evolution wait so (40:06 - 40:14)
Zia babka he's of dubious moral quality (40:08 - 40:17)
kinda in it for himself because you know (40:14 - 40:20)
he did let that chespin go into a coma (40:17 - 40:25)
and like just left it but so is he is he (40:20 - 40:27)
is he a jerk to ash is he is he like a (40:25 - 40:29)
Gary oh he's very he's very supportive (40:27 - 40:32)
of ash oh very supportive in and he is (40:29 - 40:34)
also like wants to investigate and learn (40:32 - 40:38)
more about the ash greninja whatever is (40:34 - 40:41)
going on with that biz um but he is (40:38 - 40:44)
funded by team flare and he does a few (40:41 - 40:47)
things at the request of and behest of (40:44 - 40:50)
Lysander so do you know his you know his (40:47 - 40:52)
other Pokemon besides mega Charizard oh (40:50 - 40:54)
that's really the only one that he (40:52 - 40:56)
brings out most of the time I don't (40:54 - 40:59)
remember what else okay it's really (40:56 - 41:01)
really reading reading this thread and (40:59 - 41:05)
knowing that Ash losses makes me want to (41:01 - 41:07)
watch that whole league championship I (41:05 - 41:08)
don't know how many episodes it is i (41:07 - 41:10)
remember in the Kanto it was probably I (41:08 - 41:13)
want to say like eight or six episodes (41:10 - 41:16)
that kind of and those are my favorite (41:13 - 41:18)
pokemon episodes the ones that are just (41:16 - 41:20)
like battle battle battle battle battle (41:18 - 41:23)
I just I don't know there's i'm sure (41:20 - 41:25)
those are the a lot of people's (41:23 - 41:27)
favorites because it's not the (41:25 - 41:29)
off topic kind of let's get to (41:27 - 41:31)
destination but we're in this town and (41:29 - 41:32)
there's a pincer and a cycler fighting (41:31 - 41:34)
and none of this is really relevant but (41:32 - 41:36)
it's gonna waste 23 minutes but yeah I (41:34 - 41:37)
don't know I feel like that's something (41:36 - 41:39)
I'd be very interested in watching and (41:37 - 41:40)
then it kind of makes me want to go back (41:39 - 41:43)
and watch his other league championships (41:40 - 41:45)
so I wonder if those are available (41:43 - 41:46)
because that's something I kind of want (41:45 - 41:48)
to do now well I do have the last few (41:46 - 41:51)
episodes of Pokemon X Y Z on my bedroom (41:48 - 41:54)
DVR since my living room tbo oh I don't (41:51 - 41:55)
want to say that work is I got made fun (41:54 - 41:57)
of so much the last time I said it what (41:55 - 42:00)
living room no TiVo so my tivo is the (41:57 - 42:01)
one that stopped working and it's (42:00 - 42:03)
typically what I would use to record (42:01 - 42:06)
cartoon network on so I did switch to my (42:03 - 42:07)
bedroom DVR which is the one that you (42:06 - 42:09)
have access to so if you want to fire (42:07 - 42:11)
that up well don't delete them because I (42:09 - 42:13)
haven't seen them yet to also start (42:11 - 42:15)
recording pokemon on my playstation view (42:13 - 42:18)
anyways yeah so i flossed people are (42:15 - 42:21)
upset that's kind of cool to see that (42:18 - 42:23)
people somewhat care that or are (42:21 - 42:26)
somewhat frustrated that ash still (42:23 - 42:28)
cannot be number one that has been (42:26 - 42:31)
everything for news here unless I missed (42:28 - 42:33)
something but what we'll do here is (42:31 - 42:34)
we'll take a quick break when we come (42:33 - 42:38)
back we have five new Sun and Moon (42:34 - 42:41)
Pokemon to talk about and yeah we'll (42:38 - 42:45)
continue on this journey (42:41 - 42:45)
you (42:58 - 43:00)
and we are back from our break we got (43:43 - 43:51)
some new Pokemon to talk about let's (43:48 - 43:54)
start with really bad at closing windows (43:51 - 43:57)
today let's start with the pokemon that (43:54 - 44:00)
was shown at Gamescom which was (43:57 - 44:02)
originally shown in german and then (44:00 - 44:06)
about five minutes after that showing (44:02 - 44:09)
the pokemon company the English account (44:06 - 44:13)
tweeted the image and English name for (44:09 - 44:16)
said pokemon it is a fire dragon pokemon (44:13 - 44:22)
it's known as Kurt inator which is a (44:16 - 44:25)
it's known as the land mine pokemon i do (44:22 - 44:28)
know that in the debut trailer showed (44:25 - 44:30)
off a unique move called shell trap (44:28 - 44:32)
where it shoots a laser out of its (44:30 - 44:34)
hardened shell to keep foes grounded (44:32 - 44:37)
turton ater also has the ability shell (44:34 - 44:40)
armor which I what does that new Travis (44:37 - 44:44)
shell armor it when you're when you take (44:40 - 44:47)
it I think it only is attack stat my (44:44 - 44:49)
contact but I might be incorrect it (44:47 - 44:50)
might just be any attack and I think it (44:49 - 44:54)
is any attack when you take damage your (44:50 - 44:56)
defense goes down but your speed goes up (44:54 - 44:59)
let's just off the dome I'm not sure if (44:56 - 45:00)
that's right I can look it up for you (44:59 - 45:03)
though alright as you look that up it is (45:00 - 45:07)
a red turtle like pokemon x ki flat (45:03 - 45:11)
helmet spiky back red and yellow it also (45:07 - 45:16)
i'm assuming it's its name is turtle and (45:11 - 45:19)
terminator heard a neighbor who knows I (45:16 - 45:21)
turns out I was wrong i was thinking of (45:19 - 45:22)
weak armor which is when you're hit by a (45:21 - 45:24)
physical move your defense is lowered (45:22 - 45:27)
and your speed is increased the shell (45:24 - 45:29)
armor prevents critical hits got it and (45:27 - 45:31)
that's pretty much all we know for (45:29 - 45:34)
Turton ater i don't know if you guys had (45:31 - 45:37)
any inputs on it fire dragon like this (45:34 - 45:40)
one I'm really impressed um I don't know (45:37 - 45:42)
if anybody noticed her has watched the (45:40 - 45:44)
video gameplay video and I don't know (45:42 - 45:47)
I've never seen another Pokemon that (45:44 - 45:49)
does this but it keeps its back to the (45:47 - 45:52)
battle yeah throughout the entire battle (45:49 - 45:54)
which is really cool yeah it does i (45:52 - 45:57)
notice that cool that gamescom got (45:54 - 45:59)
exclusive Pokemon I I just happened to (45:57 - 46:01)
turn that stream on because somebody (45:59 - 46:05)
tweeted it and put me in front of a (46:01 - 46:06)
bunch of German people laughing and (46:05 - 46:09)
talking and I can't look away they (46:06 - 46:12)
showed the trailer I we did it was it (46:09 - 46:15)
was cool it's I'm sure turtles are (46:12 - 46:19)
plentiful in Hawaii I mean turtles are (46:15 - 46:21)
pretty common all over the world so I (46:19 - 46:23)
actually saw a turtle in Indianapolis so (46:21 - 46:26)
there you go just hanging out all right (46:23 - 46:29)
it's like in the grass so we have some (46:26 - 46:31)
pokemon that was revealed at the World (46:29 - 46:33)
Championships here one specifically and (46:31 - 46:36)
then there was a video that showed three (46:33 - 46:39)
more but the one that was showed on (46:36 - 46:41)
stage before the World Championship (46:39 - 46:44)
stuff began was a Pokemon called crab (46:41 - 46:47)
aller crab brawler however you want to (46:44 - 46:50)
say that it is a fighting type Pokemon (46:47 - 46:52)
even though it looks like it should be a (46:50 - 46:55)
water-type pokemon crowler crab aller is (46:52 - 46:57)
a boxing Pokemon that really hates to (46:55 - 46:59)
lose it can be found clinging to (46:57 - 47:01)
buildings with its powerful pincers that (46:59 - 47:04)
also pack a punch or getting around in (47:01 - 47:06)
trees in search of berries its favorite (47:04 - 47:09)
food well that you know sums up this (47:06 - 47:11)
Pokemon a lot of people are super (47:09 - 47:13)
excited about this pokemon that I saw (47:11 - 47:18)
via Twitter and the just general feel of (47:13 - 47:20)
worlds it's a fighting pokemon even (47:18 - 47:21)
though it kind of looks like it should (47:20 - 47:23)
be water especially because it's a crab (47:21 - 47:27)
I feel like this Pokemon is is almost (47:23 - 47:29)
like the hollow of the generation where (47:27 - 47:31)
you're not going to get where it's (47:29 - 47:33)
single stage what are you guys his (47:31 - 47:36)
thoughts on cry baller but my thoughts (47:33 - 47:38)
are I was reading Twitter this morning (47:36 - 47:41)
and I saw that junichi Masuda had (47:38 - 47:44)
tweeted his lunch you know cuz he's in (47:41 - 47:46)
San Francisco for worlds right now and (47:44 - 47:48)
it was this huge plate of like fried (47:46 - 47:51)
crab and crab legs and all of the (47:48 - 47:53)
responses to that were like what did you (47:51 - 47:58)
do to crab brawler with a few poor (47:53 - 48:03)
Crabbie's thrown in is this our fifth (47:58 - 48:07)
crap pokemon crabby kingler oh and wells (48:03 - 48:10)
are poets there's a shrimp oh yeah sure (48:07 - 48:14)
it's a pistol shrimp um or the is uh (48:10 - 48:18)
maybe maybe although technically it's (48:14 - 48:20)
the boxing Pokemon yeah yeah it's that's (48:18 - 48:22)
I have a theory that this pokemon is (48:20 - 48:25)
gonna be used a lot by team skull base (48:22 - 48:27)
all year I saw your tweet and I think (48:25 - 48:28)
that's I think that's pretty accurate (48:27 - 48:32)
yeah they drew one of creb ballers eyes (48:28 - 48:36)
to have half moon and it's exactly like (48:32 - 48:39)
how team skulls goggles are yeah did you (48:36 - 48:41)
see that that somebody commented that (48:39 - 48:42)
the goggles are like that because it's a (48:41 - 48:45)
Sun and a moon yeah somebody did say (48:42 - 48:47)
like the goggles are so that can't (48:45 - 48:48)
remember credit there is your credit (48:47 - 48:51)
person we can't remember the next (48:48 - 48:53)
Pokemon on the list is stuffed full I (48:51 - 48:55)
think I'm saying that right is a normal (48:53 - 48:57)
fighting pokemon shuffle may have a (48:55 - 48:59)
small body but it's this Pokemon has (48:57 - 49:02)
extraordinary strength despite its cute (48:59 - 49:04)
fluffy appearance stuff old dislikes (49:02 - 49:07)
being touched and will flail its arm as (49:04 - 49:09)
in protest that's actually really cute (49:07 - 49:13)
stuff will evolve into beware and stuff (49:09 - 49:15)
all still has the tag on its butt yeah (49:13 - 49:16)
it has its little tag on this but which (49:15 - 49:18)
i think is really cool I'm assuming (49:16 - 49:23)
stuff elizth and then full so full of (49:18 - 49:26)
stuffing is how I'm breaking down its (49:23 - 49:29)
name also it folks the word snuggle as (49:26 - 49:33)
teddy bears are often smuggled oh I'm (49:29 - 49:34)
not this one because it doesn't like to (49:33 - 49:38)
be touched yeah I think it's yelling (49:34 - 49:39)
there yeah I think it's cool it's (49:38 - 49:43)
clearly your cup to your teddiursa your (49:39 - 49:47)
what's that panda called Pancham of the (49:43 - 49:49)
generation gotta have I gotta have your (49:47 - 49:51)
bears I think it's I think I like stuff (49:49 - 49:55)
all more than I like beware but then (49:51 - 49:57)
again beware uh I don't know this what's (49:55 - 50:00)
weird it's a weird weird little dude (49:57 - 50:05)
let's talk you duffyls cute ah let's (50:00 - 50:06)
talk about this you best pokemon that (50:05 - 50:08)
probably have been shown for this (50:06 - 50:12)
generation our first one is sandy guest (50:08 - 50:16)
which is a gross / ground type Pokemon (50:12 - 50:21)
sandy gasps emerges when the rudge's of (50:16 - 50:24)
fallen pokemon soak into sand (50:21 - 50:27)
for battle and it's a tunnel metal like (50:24 - 50:30)
mouth can suck the vitality from people (50:27 - 50:33)
and Pokemon sandy gasps also features a (50:30 - 50:35)
new water compaction ability never (50:33 - 50:38)
before seen in other Pokemon where its (50:35 - 50:42)
defense set goes up by two when it's hit (50:38 - 50:46)
by a water pipe move sandy gasps evolves (50:42 - 50:48)
into Palos and do we know if it's also (50:46 - 50:51)
immune to water types does it take (50:48 - 50:52)
damage when it takes a water type attack (50:51 - 50:55)
I read that as it still takes damage (50:52 - 50:57)
yeah I think they actually blocked that (50:55 - 51:00)
so you couldn't tell so it is up still (50:57 - 51:03)
up in the air interesting I feel like it (51:00 - 51:05)
would still take the damage but that's (51:03 - 51:08)
just me well storm drain doesn't take (51:05 - 51:11)
the damage right yeah but what a there's (51:08 - 51:12)
like a thunder move that takes the (51:11 - 51:14)
damage and then the thing still goes up (51:12 - 51:16)
or is that flare blitz I'm thinking of (51:14 - 51:18)
but that's how I move now that ability (51:16 - 51:21)
ya know lightning lightning rod image (51:18 - 51:24)
yeah prevents the damage is lightning (51:21 - 51:26)
rod and storm drain the only GU a water (51:24 - 51:29)
absorb is similar to that you don't take (51:26 - 51:31)
damage and you restore health when it by (51:29 - 51:35)
a water move sap zipper is the same but (51:31 - 51:37)
for well sap zipper you are immune to (51:35 - 51:40)
grass moves and you get special attack (51:37 - 51:42)
increase when you're hit with a grass (51:40 - 51:44)
move I think that's what it is halo sand (51:42 - 51:46)
which to me feels like the Chandeleur of (51:44 - 51:51)
this generation ghost / ground pelo sand (51:46 - 51:54)
disguises itself as a sand castle with (51:51 - 51:58)
its shovel on top serving it is believed (51:54 - 52:03)
as a radar to search out prey this (51:58 - 52:05)
unsuspecting small Pokemon are dragged (52:03 - 52:07)
into palo Sam's body through its sandy (52:05 - 52:10)
vortex so it can steal their life force (52:07 - 52:13)
wait you just missed out on the most (52:10 - 52:15)
important thing about Palos and hey I (52:13 - 52:18)
read the press release it created (52:15 - 52:22)
possibly the greatest piece of official (52:18 - 52:25)
Pokemon art to ever have been released (52:22 - 52:29)
into the world idalis and dragging the (52:25 - 52:34)
pikachu will excise down to its doom it (52:29 - 52:37)
is beautiful haha it is really sweet (52:34 - 52:38)
that (52:37 - 52:40)
art is a really fantastic and that is (52:38 - 52:42)
one hundred percent official i am (52:40 - 52:43)
looking at it on their website right now (52:42 - 52:45)
really great Travis how do you feel (52:43 - 52:47)
about saying to guess and palace palace (52:45 - 52:50)
and I think they're pretty cool I don't (52:47 - 52:51)
I know a lot of people love them and I (52:50 - 52:54)
get it but I don't I've liked a lot of (52:51 - 52:56)
the pokemon that have been announced (52:54 - 52:58)
previous to this like I think my (52:56 - 53:01)
favorite of the other than then rowlett (52:58 - 53:03)
I think my favorite of the new pokemon (53:01 - 53:04)
that have been announced is cutie fly (53:03 - 53:07)
but yeah I mean hello sounds cool I (53:04 - 53:09)
prefer my ghost grounds to be going and (53:07 - 53:11)
golurk I think that line is really cool (53:09 - 53:15)
alright alright I think Palos sand a (53:11 - 53:17)
short for pail of sand that's safe to (53:15 - 53:20)
say well what are your thoughts on these (53:17 - 53:23)
two I just am laughing to myself because (53:20 - 53:26)
so many people when the coro coro leaks (53:23 - 53:29)
first came out that were like oh this is (53:26 - 53:31)
this generation's trubbish in garbodor (53:29 - 53:34)
you know muck and grime er there these (53:31 - 53:35)
are terrible who cares about them and (53:34 - 53:37)
now like a bunch of people are like all (53:35 - 53:38)
these are the greatest things I've ever (53:37 - 53:41)
seen they are pretty great how opinions (53:38 - 53:45)
change I think a lot of people see it at (53:41 - 53:47)
face value where when you kind of dig (53:45 - 53:51)
into what was written about palette puns (53:47 - 53:56)
when you uh when you dig into palace and (53:51 - 54:01)
it is something it is a being it's just (53:56 - 54:03)
disguising itself as a sand castle which (54:01 - 54:05)
i think is really cool and it gives you (54:03 - 54:07)
more lore and more history behind that (54:05 - 54:10)
Pokemon obviously like in the anime (54:07 - 54:14)
there is the famous ghastly episode (54:10 - 54:18)
where ghastly like masks itself as that (54:14 - 54:20)
girl that died or died waiting for her (54:18 - 54:23)
lover to come back usually it's ghastly (54:20 - 54:25)
and not nine tails cuz nine tails had a (54:23 - 54:28)
whole ghost spirit house thing going on (54:25 - 54:30)
ah no I'm pretty sure was ghastly it was (54:28 - 54:32)
the one where ash brock and missed he (54:30 - 54:35)
arrived at the carnival and then at the (54:32 - 54:37)
top of the hill over the water there was (54:35 - 54:42)
a statue of a girl and then gastly was (54:37 - 54:44)
turning into it and then James fell in (54:42 - 54:45)
love with the ghost girl and the brock (54:44 - 54:47)
fellow love with the ghost girl then (54:45 - 54:49)
they realized it was ghastly I think it (54:47 - 54:51)
was gas lease first appearance action (54:49 - 54:54)
sure I have no idea who's the anime (54:51 - 54:57)
expert now it's never been me that's for (54:54 - 55:01)
darn tootin I've Travis you weren't here (54:57 - 55:03)
last week when we talked about team (55:01 - 55:05)
skull I wanted to touch on that real (55:03 - 55:07)
quick what are your thoughts on the new (55:05 - 55:11)
bad gas I think they're they're pretty (55:07 - 55:13)
cool I like how they have the feel of (55:11 - 55:16)
more like a seems like they're more (55:13 - 55:19)
evenly matched for our protagonist it (55:16 - 55:21)
seems sensible because it it looks like (55:19 - 55:23)
a lot of young people it makes more (55:21 - 55:25)
sense that the villainous team is not a (55:23 - 55:29)
collection of adults trying to wrest (55:25 - 55:32)
palkia and dialga into the universe to (55:29 - 55:34)
destroy it or whatever and that it's it (55:32 - 55:36)
seems like it's aiming towards a more (55:34 - 55:41)
focused insular story with them which I (55:36 - 55:44)
think could be done really well just (55:41 - 55:45)
because they seem like they're younger (55:44 - 55:47)
people with with like a obvious (55:45 - 55:50)
influences from like kind like I guess (55:47 - 55:53)
like 90s gang culture or something but (55:50 - 55:56)
also all of the I don't know it I I (55:53 - 55:58)
haven't quite figured out where all of (55:56 - 56:00)
the influences are supposed to come from (55:58 - 56:02)
but but I think it'll lead to a more (56:00 - 56:05)
realistic feeling story where the player (56:02 - 56:07)
character is in a ten-year-old child (56:05 - 56:10)
foiling that evil plans of someone who (56:07 - 56:12)
wants to you know destroy the world or (56:10 - 56:13)
whatever which he talked about last week (56:12 - 56:16)
and I concur yeah I wanted to ask your (56:13 - 56:18)
thoughts on some of the other pokemon (56:16 - 56:19)
that you weren't here for but I forgot (56:18 - 56:21)
we had the last bit of news here that (56:19 - 56:24)
was shown at Worlds is from the pokemon (56:21 - 56:29)
TCG the in early 2017 so a little bit (56:24 - 56:32)
little bit ways off the pokemon TCG will (56:29 - 56:34)
introduce the sun and moon series and (56:32 - 56:38)
new pokemon and GX cards the term GX (56:34 - 56:41)
describes special attacks and special (56:38 - 56:43)
pokemon that are completely new to the (56:41 - 56:46)
pokemon TCG these exciting advancements (56:43 - 56:49)
will require players to develop new tax (56:46 - 56:52)
tactics and strategy as they engage in (56:49 - 56:55)
one of the world's most popular trading (56:52 - 56:58)
card games GX attacks what are they let (56:55 - 57:01)
me tell you each Pokemon GX has a (56:58 - 57:04)
devastating GX attack that can instantly (57:01 - 57:05)
revert (57:04 - 57:07)
a player's disadvantage or create an (57:05 - 57:10)
early game advantage yeah that's what we (57:07 - 57:13)
need more early game advantage the (57:10 - 57:16)
player can can't use more than one GX (57:13 - 57:18)
attack in a game so deciding when to use (57:16 - 57:22)
a GX attack so deciding when GX attack (57:18 - 57:26)
to use and when poses a strategic (57:22 - 57:30)
strategic challenge Pokemon GX in the (57:26 - 57:32)
pokemon TCG Sun and Moon Pokemon GX will (57:30 - 57:34)
make their first appearance there are (57:32 - 57:36)
four defining characteristics of a (57:34 - 57:39)
Pokemon GX only pokemon GX have GX (57:36 - 57:41)
attacks and can only be used once per (57:39 - 57:44)
game each Pokemon GX has a minimum of (57:41 - 57:47)
two attacks in addition to its GX attack (57:44 - 57:51)
Pokemon GX have ordinary attacks and (57:47 - 57:53)
abilities besides their GX attacks it is (57:51 - 57:56)
possible to use different attacks and as (57:53 - 57:59)
the situation demands Pokemon GX have (57:56 - 58:02)
strong attacks in high HP they can (57:59 - 58:05)
overwhelm their opponent Pokemon without (58:02 - 58:08)
needing to rely on GX attacks the extra (58:05 - 58:10)
power comes at a price when a pokémon GX (58:08 - 58:12)
is knocked out the opponent will take (58:10 - 58:14)
two prize cards so the player will need (58:12 - 58:17)
to decide strategically when to use them (58:14 - 58:21)
and finally legendary Pokemon the (58:17 - 58:23)
legendary pokemon soul gay leo and luna (58:21 - 58:26)
la who appear on the cover of Pokemon (58:23 - 58:28)
Sun and Moon video games will be (58:26 - 58:31)
featured in Pope in Sun and Moon (58:28 - 58:34)
expansions as pokémon GX so gay Leo will (58:31 - 58:38)
have the sole burst GX attack which will (58:34 - 58:39)
allow players to attach five energy (58:38 - 58:42)
cards from their deck to their Pokemon (58:39 - 58:45)
in any way they like making the power of (58:42 - 58:48)
powerful attack that is useful for super (58:45 - 58:51)
energy acceleration and LU nala will (58:48 - 58:54)
have the lunar fall GX attack which lets (58:51 - 58:57)
players immediately knock out any of (58:54 - 58:59)
their opponents basic pokemon that (58:57 - 59:02)
sounds way better than so gaily has put (58:59 - 59:06)
that's going back to that old um who's (59:02 - 59:09)
the guy with the forearms Wow my mention (59:06 - 59:11)
working yeah that one my champ that (59:09 - 59:13)
would immediately knock out any basics (59:11 - 59:17)
yeah and a basic pokemon could be like (59:13 - 59:19)
technically i don't i don't (59:17 - 59:21)
if most the exes are still legal but (59:19 - 59:23)
Mewtwo DX which is 180 HP which was one (59:21 - 59:25)
of the most popular cards ever like (59:23 - 59:27)
that's technically considered a basic (59:25 - 59:31)
pokemon you exciting things for the TCG (59:27 - 59:34)
I don't as somebody who was very (59:31 - 59:36)
competitive in the TCG for two years I (59:34 - 59:38)
don't know if this would be something (59:36 - 59:40)
that would bring me back it just doesn't (59:38 - 59:43)
seem all that appealing it just if you (59:40 - 59:45)
draw your GX and you set up your GX (59:43 - 59:47)
first you have the immediate advantage (59:45 - 59:51)
and if you can't pull that GX out it (59:47 - 59:53)
just seems like you're you're instantly (59:51 - 59:56)
at a disadvantage but you can hold your (59:53 - 59:59)
ball for a GX come on stop complaining (59:56 - 60:02)
one thing I will say is whenever they (59:59 - 60:06)
have a major set up date so like right (60:02 - 60:07)
there moving into the sun and moon sets (60:06 - 60:10)
that's if you're considering getting (60:07 - 60:12)
into the TCG that's always a good time (60:10 - 60:15)
to get into it because that means that (60:12 - 60:18)
you know the and nobody's going to have (60:15 - 60:20)
these cards and it is completing a (60:18 - 60:21)
completely new mechanic so it's going to (60:20 - 60:25)
shake up the meta a lot or it should so (60:21 - 60:28)
then it's a you'll kind of be on a more (60:25 - 60:29)
even footing with people have been (60:28 - 60:32)
playing for a long time right yeah it's (60:29 - 60:34)
interesting that's that's that's it ah (60:32 - 60:36)
Travis I just wanted to throw some (60:34 - 60:39)
Pokemon names out there see if you have (60:36 - 60:41)
any thoughts you know there's Pokemon (60:39 - 60:44)
going around like wishy washy or a low (60:41 - 60:47)
in me out or a low and raichu or a lone (60:44 - 60:50)
marowak or you want me to go in that (60:47 - 60:54)
order I mean any order uh we just (60:50 - 60:55)
haven't heard your thoughts on them or (60:54 - 60:57)
the the pukey pukey can't remember its (60:55 - 61:01)
name Yuki Yuki that one's weird so (60:57 - 61:05)
wishy-washy I think the idea is the (61:01 - 61:07)
schooling ability is cool I laughed (61:05 - 61:09)
really hard when the trailer said get (61:07 - 61:13)
schooled by wishy washy yeah that made (61:09 - 61:18)
me laugh a lot I'm curious to see if the (61:13 - 61:20)
ability acts in game as its implied (61:18 - 61:22)
where it sort of implied that wishy (61:20 - 61:24)
washy doesn't evolve but instead at a (61:22 - 61:28)
certain level just becomes a stronger (61:24 - 61:30)
Pokemon and is that's represented by a (61:28 - 61:32)
bunch of wishy washy gathering (61:30 - 61:34)
other it's kind of strange seems like (61:32 - 61:36)
you would just make an evolution for it (61:34 - 61:39)
but I guess that'll make more sense when (61:36 - 61:41)
we play the game other than that I think (61:39 - 61:42)
wish you watch it just looks like a fish (61:41 - 61:48)
alone meows is awesome I think it's one (61:42 - 61:53)
of the Pokemon where it's official art (61:48 - 61:56)
kind of betrays how cool it looks in (61:53 - 61:59)
game I think the footage we've seen of a (61:56 - 62:03)
lowland mouth a lowland Meowth animated (61:59 - 62:05)
in the game is where that character (62:03 - 62:08)
design really shines of playing out the (62:05 - 62:11)
the sassiness I guess is that where (62:08 - 62:13)
people used to describe it or the the (62:11 - 62:16)
playfulness of of this version of me out (62:13 - 62:19)
let's see what was next and I like me (62:16 - 62:22)
out generally as people probably already (62:19 - 62:23)
know so another version of it that's (62:22 - 62:28)
even sassier and takes even a less flak (62:23 - 62:33)
from nerds is amazing um lulling the (62:28 - 62:37)
ride to and alone marowak all and raichu (62:33 - 62:41)
is cool its eyes scare me a little (62:37 - 62:45)
they're a little too bright um this is (62:41 - 62:47)
like extremely bright eyes if I remember (62:45 - 62:50)
correctly right yeah I think its cool (62:47 - 62:52)
the electric psychic is an interesting (62:50 - 62:54)
combination that we haven't really seen (62:52 - 62:57)
before and I like the electric terrain (62:54 - 63:00)
doubling its speed ability Electric (62:57 - 63:02)
surfer or something free what the (63:00 - 63:03)
abilities called but that's what it does (63:02 - 63:07)
that could actually make I mean I don't (63:03 - 63:09)
know that it really will come into play (63:07 - 63:13)
but giving that sort of forgotten arena (63:09 - 63:16)
effect of electric terrain a little more (63:13 - 63:20)
to do is cool hello and marowak is cool (63:16 - 63:23)
i think the fire um what do you call (63:20 - 63:26)
those the jugglers who juggle with (63:23 - 63:28)
flaming I feel like doing my throwers or (63:26 - 63:31)
whatever um I think that's a cool way to (63:28 - 63:35)
adapt that design and believe they're (63:31 - 63:38)
called jugglers really just Bob Douglas (63:35 - 63:41)
yes there's not a special word for when (63:38 - 63:43)
the thing they're juggling is on fire I (63:41 - 63:46)
think there is I don't think so (63:43 - 63:48)
better jugglers I think it's cool that (63:46 - 63:51)
they gave it a ghost-type to what else (63:48 - 63:53)
is there uh I'm not gonna do all of them (63:51 - 63:55)
I'll just throw another couple your way (63:53 - 64:01)
minor or Okoro and won the mini or the (63:55 - 64:04)
meteor guy yeah I think I think that's (64:01 - 64:05)
really cool I think it's really cute how (64:04 - 64:07)
you don't know what color it's gonna be (64:05 - 64:09)
till it's hurt and then it's like oh I'm (64:07 - 64:12)
in this in this color media work anymore (64:09 - 64:15)
but it's a mini meat-eor I think that's (64:12 - 64:18)
really neat the other one was the bird (64:15 - 64:20)
thing that changes forms right yeah with (64:18 - 64:22)
the four different types of dancing that (64:20 - 64:25)
one doesn't do much for me I think it's (64:22 - 64:27)
cool that as different forms but the (64:25 - 64:29)
design of it is a little strange to me I (64:27 - 64:31)
don't know it isn't that aesthetically (64:29 - 64:35)
appealing to me um ah we have mud Bray (64:31 - 64:37)
which is the my little pony Pokemon male (64:35 - 64:41)
side huh I love an executory oh I (64:37 - 64:42)
haven't talked about a little and (64:41 - 64:44)
executory yet the thing is a metal of (64:42 - 64:47)
how excited you get also I think a lot (64:44 - 64:50)
of people over on the screen I think a (64:47 - 64:51)
lot of people overlook this but it's (64:50 - 64:54)
grass dragon yes it is it is very much (64:51 - 64:58)
grass dragon and that's wild why mega (64:54 - 65:00)
Sceptile is also grass dragon yeah but (64:58 - 65:02)
right but at least I was not so hot at (65:00 - 65:05)
least mega Sceptile you can kind of (65:02 - 65:08)
understand that it has some dragon like (65:05 - 65:12)
aspects to it Lowell and execute or is (65:08 - 65:15)
more like mega Ampharos words oh yeah (65:12 - 65:17)
it's a dragon now too it doesn't look (65:15 - 65:19)
like it but it is and you're just gonna (65:17 - 65:21)
have to deal with that and i find that (65:19 - 65:24)
great trying to see if there's any other (65:21 - 65:26)
interesting ones i'm sure people are mad (65:24 - 65:28)
that like why haven't you talked about (65:26 - 65:31)
this or that ah but yeah i'm not seeing (65:28 - 65:32)
any unless there was something that (65:31 - 65:34)
stood out to you i mean i could say like (65:32 - 65:36)
oh one ball pics nine tails thank you (65:34 - 65:39)
like we have we technically didn't talk (65:36 - 65:41)
about those with you but I like alone (65:39 - 65:43)
Sam shrew and sand / more than I like (65:41 - 65:46)
hole and vulpix um nine tails for what (65:43 - 65:47)
that's worth what do you think of a (65:46 - 65:49)
little and oddish that's not a real (65:47 - 65:51)
thing we'd only revealed to me but I (65:49 - 65:54)
mean it'll be in the game but Pokemon (65:51 - 65:56)
company is only revealed it to me I said (65:54 - 65:58)
works when it your dad works for a (65:56 - 65:59)
Nintendo mm-hmm (65:58 - 66:01)
my dad's been gone for a long time but (65:59 - 66:04)
I'm sorry what one of my close relatives (66:01 - 66:06)
works for Nintendo when he told me that (66:04 - 66:08)
there's going to be a fire grass a (66:06 - 66:10)
little an ollie oddish and it's gonna be (66:08 - 66:13)
awesome I think you're close relative is (66:10 - 66:18)
full of garbage car boater hmm finally (66:13 - 66:19)
before we move on to our Pope one of the (66:18 - 66:21)
week yeah lowland garb odor is fairy (66:19 - 66:24)
type okay go on that would be I'm I'm (66:21 - 66:27)
sold you have an in Game Freak you (66:24 - 66:29)
tuning in Travis are you gonna buy (66:27 - 66:32)
yourself a Z ring no why would I do that (66:29 - 66:34)
so you can wear it so it can light up (66:32 - 66:38)
when you're going so i can light up and (66:34 - 66:39)
vibrate and play a song along with the (66:38 - 66:42)
video and sound and the game it will be (66:39 - 66:44)
available at for sale at participating (66:42 - 66:49)
retailers i'm sure it will remind (66:44 - 66:50)
yourself that you're talking to the (66:49 - 66:53)
person who is never bought a second (66:50 - 66:56)
console because it's limited edition or (66:53 - 67:00)
i don't i don't really care a lot about (66:56 - 67:02)
the bells and whistles wait what was (67:00 - 67:03)
that unless they're like built it and (67:02 - 67:05)
let's they're like already built into (67:03 - 67:08)
the game like the pokewalker i think is (67:05 - 67:10)
one of the greatest i was gonna just ask (67:08 - 67:12)
what your thoughts on the pokewalker (67:10 - 67:13)
were because you were given that it's (67:12 - 67:15)
not like a do wasn't like a choice right (67:13 - 67:17)
i think i think it's great because it's (67:15 - 67:20)
it adds functionality it's a game of its (67:17 - 67:23)
own you can take with you it didn't (67:20 - 67:25)
increase the price any it still it was (67:23 - 67:28)
still the same standard price for a DS (67:25 - 67:31)
game at the time and yeah and it wasn't (67:28 - 67:33)
sold separately so I'm so if I was going (67:31 - 67:35)
to get the game I had to get it and it (67:33 - 67:37)
was already cool I don't think the C (67:35 - 67:40)
ring is that cool yeah I don't think I (67:37 - 67:42)
don't think it's gonna do much for me I (67:40 - 67:44)
think I'm so gonna get it cuz i feel (67:42 - 67:46)
like i would have to talk about it I (67:44 - 67:48)
don't know like I get why it's not with (67:46 - 67:50)
the game because obviously they're gonna (67:48 - 67:51)
sell a billion of these because yokai (67:50 - 67:54)
watch and they're just riding that those (67:51 - 67:56)
coattails but a part of me is a little (67:54 - 67:58)
disappointed that it's not included with (67:56 - 68:00)
the game when in the past we've gotten (67:58 - 68:02)
like the wireless connector with firered (68:00 - 68:04)
and leafgreen we got the pokewalker with (68:02 - 68:07)
heart gold soul silver and I can't (68:04 - 68:08)
imagine this little device cost that (68:07 - 68:11)
much or really what it literally what it (68:08 - 68:13)
says is it will light up and vibrate (68:11 - 68:15)
and play a sound and that's pretty much (68:13 - 68:17)
the extent have you got a phone and I (68:15 - 68:22)
can do those things all right so as we (68:17 - 68:24)
are recording this the world (68:22 - 68:28)
championships are wrapping up in recent (68:24 - 68:30)
years we don't really cover the winners (68:28 - 68:33)
or losers of that event they exist (68:30 - 68:36)
there's quickly forgotten about unless (68:33 - 68:38)
they are the the champion themselves (68:36 - 68:40)
well did you want to talk about you (68:38 - 68:43)
probably watch more than the the out of (68:40 - 68:44)
the three of us you probably watched the (68:43 - 68:49)
most of that egg didn't watch that I'm (68:44 - 68:50)
not too tight I mean I did spend some (68:49 - 68:51)
time yesterday because I was doing some (68:50 - 68:53)
work at home and I had that up on the TV (68:51 - 68:56)
while I was watching to start with (68:53 - 68:59)
something positive I really really (68:56 - 69:02)
enjoyed that say John Park which is the (68:59 - 69:05)
former VGC world champion from Korea was (69:02 - 69:07)
playing the trading card game and (69:05 - 69:10)
obviously had gotten a world's invite (69:07 - 69:12)
and was actually doing well I saw him (69:10 - 69:15)
win around in the trading card game so I (69:12 - 69:17)
was like it would be really cool if he (69:15 - 69:19)
is the world champion in the trading (69:17 - 69:21)
card game as well and then he could be (69:19 - 69:24)
the first person ever to get the audio (69:21 - 69:26)
game and the trading card game titles um (69:24 - 69:29)
and he's really nice just it just comes (69:26 - 69:31)
across it he's a really nice person so (69:29 - 69:34)
that was really cool to say something (69:31 - 69:40)
bad I wish that Pokemon had structured (69:34 - 69:41)
the programming a little bit better (69:40 - 69:45)
because the majority of the stream was (69:41 - 69:49)
either just the casters as they call (69:45 - 69:51)
them or the commentators talking about (69:49 - 69:56)
the games or breaks and not as many (69:51 - 69:58)
games as I would like to see and I think (69:56 - 69:59)
that they've just they've done it better (69:58 - 70:02)
in the past where they really went from (69:59 - 70:03)
game to game to game and there weren't (70:02 - 70:06)
these like huge gaps between actually (70:03 - 70:08)
seeing any of the action in the games (70:06 - 70:12)
and then to end with something nice as (70:08 - 70:14)
as we do in the professional world they (70:12 - 70:18)
have added the prize cam for the TCG s (70:14 - 70:21)
so you can see what a player has prized (70:18 - 70:23)
even though they don't know what it is (70:21 - 70:25)
and that's really really cool it really (70:23 - 70:27)
like gives the (70:25 - 70:30)
it boosts the way that they do the TCG (70:27 - 70:31)
coverage in such a way that's like (70:30 - 70:34)
absolutely amazing yes that was that was (70:31 - 70:36)
first debuted at Nationals so they they (70:34 - 70:38)
this is the second time they've been (70:36 - 70:40)
using the price cams so that was that (70:38 - 70:42)
was enjoyable I mean overall it's it's (70:40 - 70:45)
been good you know obviously the BGC as (70:42 - 70:47)
disappointing as ever because we're (70:45 - 70:50)
still in the same format with so many (70:47 - 70:53)
legendaries and you know all the teams (70:50 - 70:56)
pretty much our revolving down to grout (70:53 - 70:59)
on xerneas so that's that's not as much (70:56 - 71:02)
fun but there is a lot of hope in the (70:59 - 71:06)
community now that the next series will (71:02 - 71:09)
be a lolla pokemon only and no (71:06 - 71:12)
legendaries so it'll be back to like (71:09 - 71:16)
2011 which was the unova pokemon only (71:12 - 71:19)
series and that'll be a lot of fun bring (71:16 - 71:20)
some originality back into the market I (71:19 - 71:22)
would consider playing again if they did (71:20 - 71:25)
a gen 7 Pokemon only like they did for (71:22 - 71:29)
Gen 5 although because it makes sort of (71:25 - 71:31)
a more level playing field for if you (71:29 - 71:33)
haven't played in the past year or so (71:31 - 71:35)
things sort of get wiped but I find that (71:33 - 71:39)
unlikely given that Jen 7 as with jen 6 (71:35 - 71:42)
has strong ties to previous generations (71:39 - 71:44)
with like a lowland pokemon and that (71:42 - 71:46)
sort of thing I mean it could be just (71:44 - 71:49)
jen seven decks only yeah that would I (71:46 - 71:50)
would I would certainly play if that (71:49 - 71:52)
were the case well I shouldn't say sir (71:50 - 71:54)
certainly it depends on my schedule but (71:52 - 71:56)
I would can I would consider it I would (71:54 - 71:59)
probably make a team at least if not (71:56 - 72:01)
actually go anywhere how they may have a (71:59 - 72:03)
new pentagon rule as well so that it has (72:01 - 72:07)
to be grow bread or caught in a lola (72:03 - 72:09)
region so yeah ya know then that was (72:07 - 72:14)
cool for X&Y I watched the open opening (72:09 - 72:16)
ceremonies of the stream I believe it at (72:14 - 72:20)
least my time it started 1155 a.m. and (72:16 - 72:24)
it went for almost 35 minutes before we (72:20 - 72:28)
saw the missile hi miss Ohio I think she (72:24 - 72:31)
was Miss nuttin Nevada I can't remember (72:28 - 72:34)
I can't remember who the the folks (72:31 - 72:35)
person who came out on stage they just (72:34 - 72:37)
won a version of Miss America do you (72:35 - 72:38)
remember the breeding their Twitter (72:37 - 72:40)
profile because everyone in the slack (72:38 - 72:41)
was like who is (72:40 - 72:44)
chick that has come out wearing a blazer (72:41 - 72:48)
and a Pokemon 20th anniversary shirt and (72:44 - 72:50)
she clearly read off the teleprompter (72:48 - 72:53)
quite a bit and then some people that (72:50 - 72:56)
worked at pokemon came out they showed a (72:53 - 72:59)
cry baller and then they started their (72:56 - 73:04)
live stream of games and I have to say (72:59 - 73:07)
though the the 35 minutes leading up to (73:04 - 73:10)
that was incredibly boring and extremely (73:07 - 73:13)
long-winded it was a lot of conversation (73:10 - 73:15)
going back and forth of well you know we (73:13 - 73:17)
have a lot of champions here that you (73:15 - 73:19)
know the it's anyone's game they could (73:17 - 73:21)
they could just win it again because (73:19 - 73:23)
they're so good and then there was a lot (73:21 - 73:25)
of conversation going you know this is a (73:23 - 73:27)
game where you can just start playing (73:25 - 73:29)
this year and you could instantly win (73:27 - 73:32)
and and come up and be an underdog and (73:29 - 73:34)
completely contradicting each other and (73:32 - 73:36)
they repeated that conversation back and (73:34 - 73:40)
forth for 35 minutes and to me obviously (73:36 - 73:44)
Pokemon is they upped their prize pool (73:40 - 73:47)
and they changed it from you know you (73:44 - 73:49)
don't need to claim a scholarship you (73:47 - 73:52)
can actually just claim the money there (73:49 - 73:55)
were articles recently of Pokemon you (73:52 - 73:57)
know becoming this Big East sport and it (73:55 - 74:01)
was funny because Joe from sarah b and I (73:57 - 74:03)
had a little Twitter conversation (74:01 - 74:08)
because Joe tweeted what may I don't get (74:03 - 74:09)
the recent changes what makes it in (74:08 - 74:12)
eSport now a paired compared to what it (74:09 - 74:15)
was before and i responded just more (74:12 - 74:18)
money and that was pretty much the (74:15 - 74:21)
consensus of yep the only difference (74:18 - 74:23)
here is there's more money at stake and (74:21 - 74:26)
now people are finally considering it a (74:23 - 74:28)
quote-unquote real East board because (74:26 - 74:32)
there's just more money there and so for (74:28 - 74:33)
me watching the the stream and I didn't (74:32 - 74:36)
watch a lot of it mostly because I I (74:33 - 74:40)
just don't care that much about watching (74:36 - 74:42)
it's almost like a sport like when I was (74:40 - 74:44)
at worlds when I was at Nationals it was (74:42 - 74:46)
absolutely fun to sit in that audience (74:44 - 74:49)
and sit in that crowd and watch and at (74:46 - 74:51)
the time when I was at Worlds I was with (74:49 - 74:54)
a friend who didn't know anything about (74:51 - 74:55)
Pokemon (74:54 - 74:59)
and it was very cool to see him get (74:55 - 75:01)
excited over something that he didn't (74:59 - 75:03)
know that much about and also asked (75:01 - 75:04)
questions about what was going on that (75:03 - 75:06)
was at the time that was black and white (75:04 - 75:09)
only so like when zip striker used to (75:06 - 75:11)
move and everyone cheered it was very (75:09 - 75:14)
cool to see him like why are they (75:11 - 75:15)
cheering like why is this in an (75:14 - 75:17)
important move and it was just like okay (75:15 - 75:20)
like this move only has you know eighty (75:17 - 75:24)
percent accuracy and the sandstorm is (75:20 - 75:26)
going which lowers it I'm just giving a (75:24 - 75:28)
scenario it's not right at all but I (75:26 - 75:30)
just breaking down of why that was an (75:28 - 75:32)
exciting play and that was really cool (75:30 - 75:36)
and III think with sports and stuff like (75:32 - 75:39)
that I I'm sure I'm not a sports person (75:36 - 75:40)
but I'm sure people would argue that (75:39 - 75:43)
going to see a football game in real (75:40 - 75:44)
life is more exciting than seeing it on (75:43 - 75:46)
TV or seeing a soccer game or seeing a (75:44 - 75:49)
baseball game and and I feel I (75:46 - 75:51)
definitely have that effect when it (75:49 - 75:53)
comes to pokemon I think that being (75:51 - 75:54)
there in the the audience is just way (75:53 - 75:57)
more exciting feeling that energy but (75:54 - 75:59)
going back to the commentators it was (75:57 - 76:01)
just boring and I think it suffered from (75:59 - 76:03)
that and I definitely was not the only (76:01 - 76:05)
one in the slack because we had a slack (76:03 - 76:08)
channel dedicated the world's and a lot (76:05 - 76:10)
of other people were like this is really (76:08 - 76:11)
kind of boring like you could have (76:10 - 76:13)
easily made this segment 10 minutes and (76:11 - 76:15)
then go on to the opening ceremonies I (76:13 - 76:17)
don't know why they needed to talk for (76:15 - 76:20)
30 minutes but what I would like to see (76:17 - 76:23)
in the future of these streams is for (76:20 - 76:27)
Pokemon to pick 10 or 12 people and (76:23 - 76:30)
follow their journey I want them to sit (76:27 - 76:31)
down with these people on with them to (76:30 - 76:35)
interview them before worlds or even (76:31 - 76:38)
before nationals and make video packages (76:35 - 76:41)
of them I think it's hard do it's hard (76:38 - 76:43)
for somebody who doesn't follow the (76:41 - 76:44)
video game that doesn't follow the (76:43 - 76:46)
trading card game to watch these streams (76:44 - 76:48)
and to pick somebody they want to root (76:46 - 76:51)
for and if you if you don't if you don't (76:48 - 76:53)
have somebody you want to root for it's (76:51 - 76:55)
hard for that to keep your interest and (76:53 - 76:59)
my final point is it's something silly (76:55 - 77:02)
and Travis is going to roll his eyes but (76:59 - 77:05)
I think that if you look at how WWE does (77:02 - 77:06)
this (77:05 - 77:08)
and how wrestling does this is obviously (77:06 - 77:12)
you know all the wrestling matches the (77:08 - 77:13)
outcome is pretty determined in (77:12 - 77:15)
everything but what they do before the (77:13 - 77:17)
matches and they do this a lot and they (77:15 - 77:19)
they show a lot of replays is they give (77:17 - 77:22)
you a story of why to care about which (77:19 - 77:25)
wrestler you want to win so they do (77:22 - 77:26)
these two to three-minute video packages (77:25 - 77:28)
of here's this wrestler story here's (77:26 - 77:30)
this wrestler story here's why they're (77:28 - 77:32)
fighting here's what's on the line all (77:30 - 77:34)
right now the match is going to start if (77:32 - 77:35)
you didn't have that before the match (77:34 - 77:37)
and somebody is new sitting down to (77:35 - 77:39)
wrestling and they don't know who to (77:37 - 77:41)
root for they're probably just not going (77:39 - 77:43)
to watch it they're not just they just (77:41 - 77:45)
don't hair and with Pokemon you have at (77:43 - 77:47)
least the advantage of okay this boat (77:45 - 77:48)
this person has some of my favorite (77:47 - 77:50)
pokemon on their team that's cool or (77:48 - 77:52)
this person's from America and this (77:50 - 77:53)
person for Brazil I'm from America so (77:52 - 77:55)
I'm going to root for the American but (77:53 - 77:58)
Pokemon is already walking around the (77:55 - 78:00)
show floor interviewing fans and asking (77:58 - 78:01)
what their favorite Pokemon was or when (78:00 - 78:03)
they started playing and those video (78:01 - 78:04)
packages could use a little bit of work (78:03 - 78:07)
but I think just like in sports people (78:04 - 78:09)
care about certain players they care (78:07 - 78:11)
about the Tom Brady's and the Brett (78:09 - 78:13)
Favre's and the Michael Jordan's these (78:11 - 78:15)
are only the sports people i know this (78:13 - 78:18)
is how bad my sports knowledge is but (78:15 - 78:21)
they care about those people so when so (78:18 - 78:23)
to see a person have a journey through (78:21 - 78:27)
okay like you only made it to Nationals (78:23 - 78:29)
through Last Chance Qualifier now you're (78:27 - 78:30)
going on two worlds I want to hear that (78:29 - 78:34)
story I want to have a person like that (78:30 - 78:36)
that I could care about that I could be (78:34 - 78:38)
invested in their journey instead of oh (78:36 - 78:40)
well you know this guy's been to all (78:38 - 78:42)
these Nationals and Harry is playing is (78:40 - 78:45)
a really good player let me repeat that (78:42 - 78:46)
eight more times throughout the match (78:45 - 78:48)
like that just doesn't do it for me I (78:46 - 78:52)
know a lot of other large it will the (78:48 - 78:54)
larger eSport seems try to do that I (78:52 - 78:56)
don't follow I never really followed (78:54 - 78:59)
League of Legends the pro scene there (78:56 - 79:01)
but for the short period of time where I (78:59 - 79:03)
played it myself one of the world (79:01 - 79:05)
tournaments or whatever they call the (79:03 - 79:07)
finals for that game i think they call (79:05 - 79:10)
it worlds was happening what happened to (79:07 - 79:11)
be playing it so i watched it and they (79:10 - 79:14)
try to do that there they have they tell (79:11 - 79:15)
you about the teams and they tell you (79:14 - 79:18)
about where they come from and and like (79:15 - 79:20)
who is the rookie on the team (79:18 - 79:22)
who's been there for a very long time to (79:20 - 79:24)
give you that context to understand (79:22 - 79:27)
early to give you a nugget of a reason (79:24 - 79:29)
to root for one person over the other (79:27 - 79:30)
and I think that it and I don't know how (79:29 - 79:33)
successful that is in doing what I'm (79:30 - 79:35)
about to say but I would imagine that (79:33 - 79:38)
that kind of storytelling helps people (79:35 - 79:41)
not only like us who are already (79:38 - 79:44)
invested in Pokemon because we love it (79:41 - 79:47)
and we love well done already what I (79:44 - 79:49)
would say room god I can't string a (79:47 - 79:52)
sentence together I always say we are (79:49 - 79:54)
already invested in competitive Pokemon (79:52 - 79:57)
as people who I mean it's been years for (79:54 - 80:01)
most of us um but people who've already (79:57 - 80:03)
participated in that so where we already (80:01 - 80:06)
are bought in but I think you need that (80:03 - 80:08)
type of story line to get someone who (80:06 - 80:11)
likes pokemon but doesn't necessarily (80:08 - 80:14)
love the competitive aspect to it to (80:11 - 80:16)
have any interest in in watching (80:14 - 80:18)
competitive play they they have to build (80:16 - 80:20)
those storylines I mean I don't have any (80:18 - 80:22)
like solid evidence that that works but (80:20 - 80:23)
I can't imagine being interested in it (80:22 - 80:26)
unless you sell that's type of narrative (80:23 - 80:29)
well actually a lot of there are a lot (80:26 - 80:30)
of people in our slack community who (80:29 - 80:32)
have never played competitive Pokemon (80:30 - 80:34)
and they were fascinated by the world's (80:32 - 80:37)
coverage just interesting to see how the (80:34 - 80:41)
games are played yep yeah yeah yeah i (80:37 - 80:43)
mean i can see that side of the fence (80:41 - 80:46)
but to me the coverage has been pretty (80:43 - 80:50)
much identical year up for a year true i (80:46 - 80:53)
can't comment i was gonna say i actually (80:50 - 80:55)
think that this year's has degraded a (80:53 - 80:56)
little bit i think past years has (80:55 - 80:57)
actually had better coverage just (80:56 - 81:00)
because they had better between the (80:57 - 81:02)
matches information and they had more (81:00 - 81:04)
matches up on the screen more rapidly I (81:02 - 81:06)
just I don't know what happened this (81:04 - 81:08)
year that that they haven't been able to (81:06 - 81:11)
accomplish that I would just love to see (81:08 - 81:15)
more more vignettes more player coverage (81:11 - 81:17)
even like when they're asking people (81:15 - 81:19)
questions like that's great the the (81:17 - 81:21)
thing that always turned me off is when (81:19 - 81:22)
you see those video packages of (81:21 - 81:24)
questions that questions it's like the (81:22 - 81:26)
same eight people they just ask them all (81:24 - 81:27)
three different questions and then cut (81:26 - 81:29)
that into three different video packages (81:27 - 81:33)
you're like they're 10,000 20,000 people (81:29 - 81:34)
here you could (81:33 - 81:36)
made these video packages quickly but (81:34 - 81:37)
you could easily just took the time and (81:36 - 81:39)
interviewed a couple more people and (81:37 - 81:41)
just had some more variety here but I (81:39 - 81:44)
mean that's it they clearly can edit and (81:41 - 81:47)
put out well made video packages quickly (81:44 - 81:49)
like they've definitely done that so I (81:47 - 81:51)
don't know if they need one or two more (81:49 - 81:53)
people to make even more video packages (81:51 - 81:55)
but if you're doing a three-day weekend (81:53 - 81:56)
and you're only replaying three (81:55 - 81:58)
different video packages that over and (81:56 - 82:00)
over and then you're blocking out 40 (81:58 - 82:03)
minutes for an intermission like that's (82:00 - 82:05)
not good coverage and I think we'll to (82:03 - 82:09)
answer your question of what do they (82:05 - 82:10)
need to do differently when they're (82:09 - 82:13)
already doing a lot I would just say (82:10 - 82:15)
that it VGC has been around for what (82:13 - 82:18)
seven years or something like that (82:15 - 82:21)
longer than that well the well hasn't (82:18 - 82:25)
been around super long it is it's fairly (82:21 - 82:27)
new but it's less than a decade i'm (82:25 - 82:30)
pretty sure yeah at least worlds was i (82:27 - 82:32)
can look that up but yeah continue your (82:30 - 82:35)
point but i was going to say it's not (82:32 - 82:40)
that new but it feels every year like (82:35 - 82:42)
that i mean they will constantly be the (82:40 - 82:45)
underdogs there's no chance that unless (82:42 - 82:48)
the game itself changes radically you're (82:45 - 82:50)
not going to have a robust competitive (82:48 - 82:53)
scene on the scale of something like a (82:50 - 82:56)
starcraft 2 in its heyday or league of (82:53 - 82:58)
legends or whatever world coverage for (82:56 - 83:01)
the video game started in 2009 at san (82:58 - 83:04)
diego so exactly seven years started (83:01 - 83:06)
with pokemon platinum was the first game (83:04 - 83:08)
that had competitive coverage and the (83:06 - 83:14)
BCG started in 2004 with the expedition (83:08 - 83:16)
and e x hidden legend set so I guess (83:14 - 83:18)
what I'm saying is you've had seven (83:16 - 83:22)
years it shouldn't feel like it it (83:18 - 83:24)
shouldn't feel like constantly every (83:22 - 83:27)
year that Pokemon is this struggling (83:24 - 83:29)
up-and-comer it seems like you would (83:27 - 83:31)
have it figured out by your seven I mean (83:29 - 83:32)
I realize it's not gonna be the hugest (83:31 - 83:34)
thing but it seems like you'd have the (83:32 - 83:37)
execution of it down so that you could (83:34 - 83:38)
start doing the type of experimentation (83:37 - 83:40)
that Steve is suggesting as opposed to (83:38 - 83:43)
focusing on just the minimum execution I (83:40 - 83:45)
don't know well but they're video (83:43 - 83:47)
streaming of the competition's only (83:45 - 83:48)
started in two (83:47 - 83:50)
12 yeah it was the first year that they (83:48 - 83:53)
had a stream so it's only been four (83:50 - 83:56)
years for them so I'll give them one (83:53 - 84:01)
more year so 2017 they need to get the (83:56 - 84:04)
three of us first of all you must need (84:01 - 84:07)
to be there providing color commentary (84:04 - 84:09)
maybe not the competitive commentary but (84:07 - 84:11)
we can be better bright and cheerful (84:09 - 84:14)
faces than Miss Ohio or whoever she is (84:11 - 84:15)
who actually doesn't know anything about (84:14 - 84:17)
Pokemon I didn't see that part of the (84:15 - 84:18)
ceremony so I have nothing to say no no (84:17 - 84:21)
no she she is doing all of the post (84:18 - 84:23)
competition interviews of the people of (84:21 - 84:25)
the okay I know here talking about yeah (84:23 - 84:28)
and I mean well number one that'll step (84:25 - 84:30)
it up because people will be laughing a (84:28 - 84:31)
heck of a lot more than they currently (84:30 - 84:36)
are but yeah I just think that they also (84:31 - 84:38)
can work better at scheduling the (84:36 - 84:41)
matches so that because you know they (84:38 - 84:43)
have four channels they have the main (84:41 - 84:45)
channel that's a little bit of (84:43 - 84:46)
everything they have the trading card (84:45 - 84:49)
channel the VGC channel and then the PO (84:46 - 84:51)
contains channel and they could (84:49 - 84:54)
literally because they control this (84:51 - 84:56)
event organized the matches so that they (84:54 - 84:59)
know that they will go from a trading (84:56 - 85:01)
card match to a video game match to a (84:59 - 85:03)
pokin match or something like that so (85:01 - 85:05)
that they always have some content going (85:03 - 85:08)
on that main channel and not a 60-minute (85:05 - 85:11)
dinner break absolutely or even like (85:08 - 85:13)
just have a camera up in the ceiling (85:11 - 85:16)
over showing the show floor and have (85:13 - 85:19)
that running for 16 minutes instead of (85:16 - 85:23)
just a animated wallpaper (85:19 - 85:25)
pretty much that's all it was yep I (85:23 - 85:30)
don't know I world is world's could be (85:25 - 85:32)
more exciting obviously this year didn't (85:30 - 85:35)
help that it was not open to the general (85:32 - 85:38)
public we'll see what they do next here (85:35 - 85:42)
and yeah we'll go from there let's wrap (85:38 - 85:46)
this show up we'll noticed a Pokemon (85:42 - 85:51)
being used in the VGC stuff that was (85:46 - 85:56)
kind of uh unique in as usual unusual (85:51 - 86:01)
and so our pokemon of the week this week (85:56 - 86:09)
is arcane 9 Arcanine the legendary (86:01 - 86:13)
pokemon i think that's what the species (86:09 - 86:16)
name is that is correct yep a real solid (86:13 - 86:18)
win from Pokemon there I like the (86:16 - 86:23)
Japanese name uh windy windy that's what (86:18 - 86:26)
is going yep windy that's neat alright (86:23 - 86:29)
our canine is a fiercely brave and loyal (86:26 - 86:33)
Pokemon it is capable of running 6,200 (86:29 - 86:39)
miles within 24 hours yeah me too with a (86:33 - 86:42)
speed and grace reminiscent of flight I (86:39 - 86:45)
just want to say that I looked up how (86:42 - 86:49)
far fiji water comes to Milwaukee and it (86:45 - 86:54)
is 7,200 miles star an Arcanine within (86:49 - 86:56)
24 hours can almost run from Milwaukee (86:54 - 87:00)
to Fiji in 24 hours (86:56 - 87:04)
me too our canine has long been admired (87:00 - 87:07)
for its beauty and speed and anyone who (87:04 - 87:11)
hears its bark will Bravo before us the (87:07 - 87:14)
source of its power is a is a flame (87:11 - 87:18)
blazing wildly inside it and the anime (87:14 - 87:21)
it was shown that it scratches that its (87:18 - 87:24)
stash stashes food in its main and (87:21 - 87:27)
carries it to its nest for its young our (87:24 - 87:30)
canine lives on prairies and pokemon (87:27 - 87:33)
snap also shown it living in active (87:30 - 87:36)
volcanoes glad we have that Pokemon (87:33 - 87:38)
snapper (87:36 - 87:38)
yeah Gary at an Arcanine apparently that (87:39 - 87:46)
he's the ins Giovanni that's a fact so (87:42 - 87:48)
we'll noticed our canine there was two (87:46 - 87:51)
that made it into the top top 16 I think (87:48 - 87:54)
I pulled right from Pokemon calm at the (87:51 - 87:56)
2016 world tournament one of them was (87:54 - 87:59)
holding a red card the other was holding (87:56 - 88:02)
a life orb but travis has its own move (87:59 - 88:05)
set that you can use if you care to do (88:02 - 88:10)
so yeah normally I tried to deviate a (88:05 - 88:13)
little bit from (88:10 - 88:16)
something you could just get on a smug (88:13 - 88:19)
on because I mean you can just go on (88:16 - 88:23)
smogon and find the optimal list and (88:19 - 88:26)
sometimes that means I only change one (88:23 - 88:29)
move or two because to be frank that our (88:26 - 88:33)
pokemon that can be used at that there (88:29 - 88:36)
is an optimal way to use them based on (88:33 - 88:38)
the tools they have at their disposal (88:36 - 88:40)
arcanine is a Pokemon however that has (88:38 - 88:46)
so much of a useable move pool well it's (88:40 - 88:48)
it's not huge but it has a lot of (88:46 - 88:52)
different type coverage between stuff (88:48 - 88:54)
like I mean the stab moves like flare (88:52 - 88:58)
blitz and uh well yeah it's only fire (88:54 - 89:01)
type so stab moves like flare blitz or (88:58 - 89:05)
off type moves for coverage like wild (89:01 - 89:07)
charge even close combat and crunch as (89:05 - 89:10)
all those those are all competitively (89:07 - 89:13)
viable moves that has access to in (89:10 - 89:15)
addition to a move that's probably going (89:13 - 89:18)
to be on every arcanine move site which (89:15 - 89:20)
is extreme speed which to those who are (89:18 - 89:22)
unaware is like quick attack where it (89:20 - 89:26)
goes first it has increased priority to (89:22 - 89:29)
be specific also a normal type move but (89:26 - 89:31)
as a base power of 80 which is more (89:29 - 89:33)
significant than quick attacks and as a (89:31 - 89:35)
priority of plus 2 whereas something (89:33 - 89:39)
like quick attack or sucker punch or (89:35 - 89:42)
aqua jet I think sucker punch has only (89:39 - 89:45)
plus 1 don't count on that one but your (89:42 - 89:47)
typical increased priority moves are (89:45 - 89:49)
only priority plus one so if you use (89:47 - 89:51)
extreme speed and your opponent Noozhawk (89:49 - 89:53)
which uses Aquajet even if you're a (89:51 - 89:55)
slower Pokemon you're still going to (89:53 - 89:57)
outspeed that's why I extreme speed is (89:55 - 90:01)
such a great move to have flare blitz (89:57 - 90:03)
and extreme speed are probably going to (90:01 - 90:07)
be on your set regardless of what you're (90:03 - 90:10)
doing unless you're doing something like (90:07 - 90:13)
a special attacking set which isn't (90:10 - 90:15)
impossible but because there's so much (90:13 - 90:18)
you can do other than that you can have (90:15 - 90:23)
I'll just list some of the (90:18 - 90:26)
options even though these are I mean I'm (90:23 - 90:28)
taking these stripe from the smokin (90:26 - 90:32)
article just because we could be here (90:28 - 90:33)
all day trying to figure out what our (90:32 - 90:36)
niche version of this Pokemon that (90:33 - 90:38)
already has decent versatility is or I (90:36 - 90:40)
could just give you some of the options (90:38 - 90:43)
which i think is more beneficial so if (90:40 - 90:45)
you want to go for the defensive route (90:43 - 90:46)
you're still going to want to include (90:45 - 90:48)
Flair bit blitz and extreme speed (90:46 - 90:52)
because there's such powerful moves and (90:48 - 90:54)
they're powerful regardless of whether (90:52 - 90:58)
you invest effort values into attack (90:54 - 91:00)
flare blitz just because of its (90:58 - 91:02)
extremely high base power at 120 and (91:00 - 91:05)
extreme speed because sometimes even as (91:02 - 91:07)
a defensive Pokemon you need to get a (91:05 - 91:09)
little bit of damage in when the (91:07 - 91:11)
opponent's weak without to prevent (91:09 - 91:12)
yourself from taking that extra damage (91:11 - 91:17)
if you're going that defensive route you (91:12 - 91:19)
are going to want to use Morning Sun (91:17 - 91:21)
which is a recovering move that recovers (91:19 - 91:24)
more in sunlight it's fifty percent in (91:21 - 91:27)
normal weather then I believe 75% if (91:24 - 91:31)
it's sunny and then you'll probably want (91:27 - 91:34)
one status effect mode smogon says (91:31 - 91:36)
either will-o-wisp or toxic I think (91:34 - 91:40)
willow wisp is more fun um and you're (91:36 - 91:41)
already going for a sort of physically (91:40 - 91:44)
defensive set given that Arcanine has (91:41 - 91:46)
access to intimidate which is an ability (91:44 - 91:48)
where when it switches in it lowers the (91:46 - 91:51)
opponent's physical attack by one stage (91:48 - 91:53)
so you can double down on that by (91:51 - 91:55)
lowering their physical physical attack (91:53 - 91:58)
further with a burn item i would go with (91:55 - 92:00)
rocky helmet because you're already (91:58 - 92:02)
getting recovery from morning sun so you (92:00 - 92:03)
don't have to worry as much about (92:02 - 92:09)
leftovers and then your they recommend (92:03 - 92:11)
ambush nature and i don't remember what (92:09 - 92:13)
that one is but i'm sure it's fine um (92:11 - 92:18)
they recommend 248 hp8 attack and 252 (92:13 - 92:20)
defense I'm sure the eight attack is (92:18 - 92:22)
there for some niche circumstance where (92:20 - 92:25)
it allows flare blitz to one hit KO some (92:22 - 92:29)
important meta pokemon in their (92:25 - 92:30)
underused tier list so you can probably (92:29 - 92:32)
disregard that if you're just doing it (92:30 - 92:35)
for fun and just do full HP and defense (92:32 - 92:36)
on this defense of our (92:35 - 92:40)
9 if you're going to go offensive you (92:36 - 92:43)
just do flare blitz extreme speed um and (92:40 - 92:46)
then I like I'm just a fan of wild (92:43 - 92:48)
charge as a move I think it's cool i'm (92:46 - 92:51)
in close combat and then you could (92:48 - 92:53)
either I like choice band they recommend (92:51 - 92:55)
life orb but because you've got extreme (92:53 - 92:57)
speed I think choice band can be (92:55 - 93:00)
extremely powerful as well your ability (92:57 - 93:02)
choice here is up to you if you want (93:00 - 93:04)
something in to switch in on the fire (93:02 - 93:07)
type you might want to do flash fire or (93:04 - 93:09)
intimidate is just a generally great (93:07 - 93:12)
ability all around and then if you're (93:09 - 93:15)
going that that band choice band set (93:12 - 93:18)
because you have extreme speed i would (93:15 - 93:20)
say you still want to go adamant even (93:18 - 93:21)
though you're not going going to (93:20 - 93:23)
outspeed that much because you don't (93:21 - 93:24)
have to worry too much about it because (93:23 - 93:27)
you've got decent natural bulk and that (93:24 - 93:28)
increased priority move so i would go (93:27 - 93:30)
with adamant over gently but that's up (93:28 - 93:34)
to you and then your eb's 252 and attack (93:30 - 93:36)
and speed so there's your two options (93:34 - 93:39)
offensive ND so defensive I feel like (93:36 - 93:40)
get ramble too long but hey now that's (93:39 - 93:43)
alright already like a two hour show so (93:40 - 93:46)
also just to explain for the arcanine (93:43 - 93:48)
that was used in worlds it was holding (93:46 - 93:51)
red card and what red card does is if (93:48 - 93:53)
the Pokemon holding the red card is hit (93:51 - 93:56)
by an attack the attacker is immediately (93:53 - 93:58)
switched out and replaced by a random (93:56 - 94:02)
Pokemon from the opponent's team so I (93:58 - 94:07)
believe the intent there is one of the (94:02 - 94:09)
major threats this year is xerneas and (94:07 - 94:13)
xerneas would have a out be holding a (94:09 - 94:15)
power herb which allows it to use its (94:13 - 94:19)
move geomancy which is a stat boosting (94:15 - 94:22)
move when in one turn rather than two (94:19 - 94:24)
turns which it typically takes so let's (94:22 - 94:28)
say xerneas geo man sees in one turn it (94:24 - 94:31)
uses up its power herb and then if it (94:28 - 94:33)
attacked arcanine it is taken out of (94:31 - 94:34)
battle and it loses those stat boosts (94:33 - 94:36)
and it can't geomancy in one turn again (94:34 - 94:40)
so I've like that helps to be defensive (94:36 - 94:45)
that's cool it it's not it's it's one of (94:40 - 94:47)
those cases where xerneas is such an (94:45 - 94:49)
incredibly and I mean this is I (94:47 - 94:50)
typically (94:49 - 94:52)
give the advice for single battles (94:50 - 94:55)
because I know more about that but from (94:52 - 94:58)
the little i've played VGC 2016 these (94:55 - 95:01)
pokemon that are at the top level are so (94:58 - 95:04)
strong that setting up a pokemon like (95:01 - 95:07)
arcanine as a quote-unquote counter to (95:04 - 95:10)
czar Gnaeus in this case or or when (95:07 - 95:11)
you're trying to set up a counter to (95:10 - 95:15)
grout on or something like that a lot of (95:11 - 95:17)
the time it you have to end up settling (95:15 - 95:19)
for more of a soft counter like like (95:17 - 95:22)
this because if you're building (95:19 - 95:26)
something to be able to easily won at ko (95:22 - 95:28)
for instance these massive powerhouses (95:26 - 95:30)
of Pokemon they probably don't have the (95:28 - 95:33)
versatility to do much else so I imagine (95:30 - 95:35)
that sort of roundabout way of (95:33 - 95:37)
countering Czerny says Gio mansi is (95:35 - 95:40)
because arcanine can do that and also be (95:37 - 95:43)
okay on its own as opposed to I don't (95:40 - 95:46)
know some some steel pipe that out (95:43 - 95:48)
speeds just to get super effective on (95:46 - 95:51)
xerneas or something like bronze i guess (95:48 - 95:56)
like bronze unsure the trivia here that (95:51 - 95:58)
i have is in the pokemon red and blue (95:56 - 96:00)
beta are can't arcanine was originally (95:58 - 96:03)
known as blaze though our canine does (96:00 - 96:05)
not let a legendary pokemon it is seen (96:03 - 96:07)
in a degrading along with legendary (96:05 - 96:09)
pokémon moltres Articuno and zapdos in (96:07 - 96:14)
the anime episode pokemon emergency many (96:09 - 96:16)
of our canines pokedex entries starting (96:14 - 96:18)
with the one in japanese pokemon red (96:16 - 96:21)
references the real world specifically (96:18 - 96:25)
china our canine is based on the Rye (96:21 - 96:27)
Kuen which is a mythical creature (96:25 - 96:30)
inspired by lions tigers and dogs (96:27 - 96:33)
statues of them statues of them in pairs (96:30 - 96:36)
are used as guardians that invite good (96:33 - 96:39)
spirits and repel evil ones yeah that's (96:36 - 96:43)
it for trivia here which is weird the (96:39 - 96:44)
Pokemon so old and it doesn't have that (96:43 - 96:47)
much privia about it if you get a shiny (96:44 - 96:52)
arcanine it is gold instead of the (96:47 - 96:55)
oranges orangish red that it normally (96:52 - 96:57)
has it still keeps its black stripes but (96:55 - 97:00)
that orange color turns to a goldish (96:57 - 97:02)
color which is pretty cool (97:00 - 97:04)
I gotta say though I hate that Arcanine (97:02 - 97:06)
is considered the legendary Pokemon and (97:04 - 97:08)
is not a legendary Pokemon what they (97:06 - 97:09)
didn't know what they were doing in gen (97:08 - 97:12)
1 yeah well they can fix it they fix (97:09 - 97:14)
other Pokemon on the past go ahead and (97:12 - 97:16)
fix this they ever changed a species (97:14 - 97:18)
name though ah I don't believe don't (97:16 - 97:20)
think so no but hey it's their game they (97:18 - 97:23)
can do what they want they can put a 60 (97:20 - 97:24)
minutes off band on it if they want to (97:23 - 97:27)
yeah I think at this point it's sort of (97:24 - 97:29)
endearing that it's the legendary (97:27 - 97:32)
Pokemon and not a legendary pokemon it's (97:29 - 97:33)
going history to it like the weird stuff (97:32 - 97:36)
with Gandhian in the civilization series (97:33 - 97:39)
were that some underflow error made him (97:36 - 97:42)
very keen on using nuclear weapons it's (97:39 - 97:44)
just something that weird mistake early (97:42 - 97:46)
in a game that then becomes a running (97:44 - 97:48)
joke throughout do you not know about (97:46 - 97:52)
that though I don't like play civ in the (97:48 - 97:55)
original sit so the way that the camera (97:52 - 97:57)
moves civil one or civ to but i think (97:55 - 97:59)
it's the original civilization the way (97:57 - 98:02)
the game handled aggression of various (97:59 - 98:04)
types between civilizations was there (98:02 - 98:07)
they had a value as the number one and (98:04 - 98:10)
it could change over time as the game (98:07 - 98:13)
went on up or down but the different (98:10 - 98:15)
leaders had different values to reflect (98:13 - 98:18)
how they acted in history so for Gandhi (98:15 - 98:21)
who led the Indian civilization and I (98:18 - 98:25)
came they wanted to show the the (98:21 - 98:27)
nonviolent resistance that he advocated (98:25 - 98:30)
so naturally they gave him a zero in (98:27 - 98:35)
nuclear aggression but when he (98:30 - 98:37)
when something would happen in the game (98:35 - 98:38)
that would cause that variable to go (98:37 - 98:42)
lower like maybe he adopted some sort of (98:38 - 98:44)
policy that would make him even less (98:42 - 98:47)
likely to use nuclear weapons the game (98:44 - 98:50)
says okay I can't go below zero so it's (98:47 - 98:52)
an underflow error that causes it to be (98:50 - 98:56)
the maximum maximum gradually that it (98:52 - 98:58)
can be and so all of a sudden Gandhi (98:56 - 99:01)
starts developing nuclear weapons incur (98:58 - 99:04)
like it massive beautiful rapid pace and (99:01 - 99:06)
using them all over the place and so it (99:04 - 99:09)
has since become a running joke some (99:06 - 99:11)
games in the series of haven't (99:09 - 99:12)
referenced it or have made them (99:11 - 99:14)
completely passive but I think even in (99:12 - 99:18)
civ 5 he is very passive throughout the (99:14 - 99:22)
game until nuclear weapons are available (99:18 - 99:23)
and then he starts going for them just (99:22 - 99:25)
as a wink and a nod to that original (99:23 - 99:28)
game that's really cool so here's a (99:25 - 99:30)
crucial question how many cats is one (99:28 - 99:33)
arcanine oh I would probably say 1 2 3 4 (99:30 - 99:38)
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 I would probably (99:33 - 99:43)
say 14 cats 7 cats 7 now six foot three (99:38 - 99:46)
tall board honey cats how many cats do (99:43 - 99:48)
you think I am I'm not 14 cat well I'm (99:46 - 99:51)
Ali I mean just because he's 6 tall (99:48 - 99:52)
doesn't mean that he still doesn't have (99:51 - 99:57)
the booty ah and the booty is stopped at (99:52 - 100:01)
least four cats all right all right hop (99:57 - 100:04)
this the tail is at least to look at (100:01 - 100:07)
that thing all right fine I will concede (100:04 - 100:11)
14 cats cats Travis is at the travis w (100:07 - 100:14)
on twitter trying to run away from you (100:11 - 100:16)
talking about all kinds booty one that's (100:14 - 100:19)
a show become i leave for a few my god (100:16 - 100:23)
well as at wash in the sink i am at (100:19 - 100:26)
dragging a lake if you haven't done so (100:23 - 100:28)
already please leave us review and (100:26 - 100:31)
itunes that would help us out immensely (100:28 - 100:34)

people in it hanging out talking having (100:50 - 100:55)
a great time if you're not sure what (100:53 - 100:57)
patreon is patreon is like Kickstarter (100:55 - 101:01)
except there is no overall goal kick (100:57 - 101:03)
starter is usually one big goal sum of (101:01 - 101:05)
money at a time frame patreon is to (101:03 - 101:08)
support us monthly and we have some new (101:05 - 101:12)
tier levels that you can support at but (101:08 - 101:14)
one dollar a month is is something that (101:12 - 101:16)
I think is easy for everyone if you (101:14 - 101:17)
don't have to do it if you don't want to (101:16 - 101:19)
but if you like like the show and you (101:17 - 101:21)
