Sunday it was a holiday weekend there is (1:27 - 1:31)
a huge announcement (1:29 - 1:33)
is is there wait did I put in the notes (1:31 - 1:34)
or is this is this something you're (1:33 - 1:37)
surprising us with we have we have a (1:34 - 1:41)
date for a very special edition oh yeah (1:37 - 1:43)

at the end of the (1:43 - 1:48)
show just say there's no (1:45 - 1:52)
news uh let's start off with the Pokemon (1:48 - 1:56)
sleep recap as we always do it was Eevee (1:52 - 1:59)
week to celebrate Eevee day which was (1:56 - 2:04)
November 23rd um how Hannah how was your (1:59 - 2:06)
e did you get all the EES you (2:04 - 2:10)
wanted uh uh first of all Eevee day was (2:06 - 2:12)
November 21st not 23rd oh my yeah yeah (2:10 - 2:13)
yeah (2:12 - 2:16)
you're you're right the the the (2:13 - 2:21)
1121 yeah yeah it's a little weird when (2:16 - 2:22)
you try to get through the Japanese but (2:21 - 2:26)
it is that um there were a lot of Eevees (2:22 - 2:28)
I am actually really enjoying the extra (2:26 - 2:30)
missions that they make available during (2:28 - 2:32)
these events both the Halloween event (2:30 - 2:33)
and the Eevee event I feel like that's (2:32 - 2:37)
the biggest part for me I may have made (2:33 - 2:40)
a mistake and went to and uh went to (2:37 - 2:43)
Topo this week where really you had to (2:40 - 2:46)
make it to master level one in order to (2:43 - 2:48)
see any of the eeve utions and I only (2:46 - 2:50)
made it there this morning and it's (2:48 - 2:53)
Sunday so that might have been a mistake (2:50 - 2:54)
but I still caught a lot of Eevee so I'm (2:53 - 2:58)
happy going to topollo is a constant (2:54 - 3:01)
mistake every time would you stop (2:58 - 3:04)
did you there who's a (3:01 - 3:06)
cutie I got I did get an onyx I found an (3:04 - 3:08)
onyx and I found a Shuppet I don't think (3:06 - 3:10)
I was able to catch either of them I (3:08 - 3:12)
think they both filled up pretty quickly (3:10 - 3:14)
but I got to take pictures of both an (3:12 - 3:19)
onyx and a Shuppet nice um I went to the (3:14 - 3:22)
beach because of Vaporeon and I didn't (3:19 - 3:24)
see my first Vaporeon until today and it (3:22 - 3:27)
wasn't hungry but the gold duck was cuz (3:24 - 3:31)
I need another gold duck you do (3:27 - 3:33)
I don't I just used my premium on (3:31 - 3:35)
another Eevee and was like maybe it'll (3:33 - 3:39)
have Berry finder and it didn't that's (3:35 - 3:41)
okay uh Greg where did you end up (3:39 - 3:44)
camping this week camping this week I (3:41 - 3:46)
went to top (3:44 - 3:48)
Hollow for (3:46 - 3:51)
for I don't know reasons look there (3:48 - 3:53)
could have been an espon here's the (3:51 - 3:54)
thing here's my reasoning I don't want (3:53 - 3:57)
to have to do 150 hours with an (3:54 - 4:00)
Eevee to get some of these things I'm (3:57 - 4:01)
hoping one of them will just show up and (4:00 - 4:04)
I can grab it and I can be done that has (4:01 - 4:05)
not happened and it's not going to (4:04 - 4:07)
happen because I don't put a lot of time (4:05 - 4:10)
into the game so I'm gonna have to put (4:07 - 4:13)
an Eevee on my team because eeve good do (4:10 - 4:18)
the 150 hours like seven (4:13 - 4:18)
times uh exhausting there there there (4:18 - 4:25)
was boosted shiny odds for Eevee um and (4:21 - 4:28)
I liked how they they gave you like (4:25 - 4:30)
Eevee incense for some of the rewards I (4:28 - 4:32)
thought that was like really good and I (4:30 - 4:34)
think using your Eevee in well when (4:32 - 4:36)
you're listening to the top Monday Eevee (4:34 - 4:38)
week will be over but I think using your (4:36 - 4:40)
Eevee incense during a week where Eevee (4:38 - 4:42)
does have boosted shiny odds is pretty (4:40 - 4:44)
smart and (4:42 - 4:47)
clever I saw a ton of people on social (4:44 - 4:50)
media get chiny Eevees so I I don't I I (4:47 - 4:51)
don't think I don't think this is an (4:50 - 4:53)
Niantic situation where they like forgot (4:51 - 4:56)
to turn it on or anything think I've (4:53 - 4:58)
seen people get it I didn't get it but I (4:56 - 5:00)
saw people say they got it oh yeah I was (4:58 - 5:03)
seeing people in my friends list get it (5:00 - 5:05)
not every single day of the week but (5:03 - 5:07)
multiple days of the week yeah so if you (5:05 - 5:09)
if you were lucky trainers congrats on (5:07 - 5:13)
your shiny Eevee um uh as you're (5:09 - 5:16)
listening to this it is a good sleep day (5:13 - 5:18)
which I think is the fourth good sleep (5:16 - 5:20)
day the fourth good sleep day scam box (5:18 - 5:23)
in the store very expensive it's (5:20 - 5:27)
literally like $25 I think (5:23 - 5:31)
um because it is falling on a Monday (5:27 - 5:33)
instead of doing the times two bonus on (5:31 - 5:36)
good sleep day they're doing a times 4 (5:33 - 5:38)
bonus which (5:36 - 5:41)
sure I I was don't sleep as well during (5:38 - 5:43)
the weekday yeah on (5:41 - 5:45)
average I was curious what would happen (5:43 - 5:47)
if it did fall out on Monday this was (5:45 - 5:51)
their solution was just to boost it more (5:47 - 5:54)
so that's fine I like that how dare the (5:51 - 5:57)
full moon fall on the start of the week (5:54 - 6:01)
how dare the lunar cycle be a thing (5:57 - 6:01)
um shifting gears here to the Seven Star (6:03 - 6:12)
huan samuro raid which oddly enough we (6:08 - 6:15)
talked about last week I didn't think (6:12 - 6:18)
they were just going to roll that raid (6:15 - 6:21)
right after Eevee Eevee had one weekend (6:18 - 6:25)
no repeat they had the Eevee outbreaks (6:21 - 6:27)
one weekend no (6:25 - 6:29)
repeat I I get that they were going (6:27 - 6:32)
going for more of like we want to put (6:29 - 6:34)
this closer to Eevee (6:32 - 6:37)
day but also yeah but it it wasn't (6:34 - 6:41)
actually on Eevee day yeah correct yes (6:37 - 6:44)
yes true but which which is always like (6:41 - 6:46)
a (6:44 - 6:49)
weird thing like it's their game they (6:46 - 6:53)
could extend it more past because most (6:49 - 6:56)
raids are are for the US Thursday night (6:53 - 6:59)
to Sunday night because it goes off UTC (6:56 - 7:00)
time that's why I like they say Friday (6:59 - 7:05)
does Monday but UTC time we get it (7:00 - 7:08)
Thursday night they it's their game they (7:05 - 7:11)
could extend it a couple more days it (7:08 - 7:15)
doesn't have to end on Sunday look ended (7:11 - 7:18)
the calendar wedes these are the dates (7:15 - 7:19)
and these are the dates only and if you (7:18 - 7:22)
move past it it puts everything else (7:19 - 7:24)
into Jeopardy it's like you don't (7:22 - 7:25)
understand how calendars work it's true (7:24 - 7:28)
I don't I I I've I've booked a a whole (7:25 - 7:30)
flight to Boston the completely wrong (7:28 - 7:33)
month the completely wrong month it was (7:30 - 7:37)
the right day though just the wrong (7:33 - 7:39)
month I I think a lot of people have (7:37 - 7:42)
done that I have just been brave enough (7:39 - 7:44)
to admit (7:42 - 7:47)
it I am sure there is a percentage of (7:44 - 7:50)
the populace that has done (7:47 - 7:52)
that just like there's a percentage of (7:50 - 7:54)
the populace that has done many things (7:52 - 7:57)
is it a large percentage I'm going to (7:54 - 7:58)
say (7:57 - 8:01)
no (7:58 - 8:03)
I'm willing to bet it's like 50% of (8:01 - 8:06)
people have booked 50% are you half of (8:03 - 8:08)
people who have booked a flight have I (8:06 - 8:09)
can't agree with (8:08 - 8:13)
that if you're watching on YouTube (8:09 - 8:16)
comment below if You' booked a flight on (8:13 - 8:18)
the wrong days I'm sure that has (8:16 - 8:21)
happened I am sure that has happened but (8:18 - 8:24)
not to 50% of the populace I feel like (8:21 - 8:26)
it probably happens more off by a day or (8:24 - 8:32)
two and not off by a month hey numbers (8:26 - 8:32)
are okay going back to Sam Rod I have no (8:33 - 8:38)
problem with them repeating like doing (8:37 - 8:40)
an like a one weeken (8:38 - 8:42)
event (8:40 - 8:45)
but there was no reason why they (8:42 - 8:46)
couldn't extend it especially the (8:45 - 8:48)
outbreaks you're doing a brand new (8:46 - 8:50)
event which is cool I mean it was (8:48 - 8:52)
relatively easy for everyone I saw some (8:50 - 8:54)
people struggle we see this every raid (8:52 - 8:57)
totally fine I'm not here to like shame (8:54 - 8:58)
you for struggling with a sevenstar (8:57 - 9:00)
Eevee um we still have people that are (8:58 - 9:02)
bringing like level 75 Pokemon to five (9:00 - 9:04)
seven stars and like being like why am I (9:02 - 9:07)
losing totally we get it but it was (9:04 - 9:11)
really hard for me to balance like okay (9:07 - 9:14)
it's on the weekend I I wanted I want to (9:11 - 9:15)
do the EV raids because they're dropping (9:14 - 9:18)
HP up but I also want a shiny hunt (9:15 - 9:20)
because the outbreaks are there and (9:18 - 9:23)
usually if it's like a repeat it's like (9:20 - 9:24)
okay I'll just do the raids this weekend (9:23 - 9:26)
and then I'll do the outbreaks the next (9:24 - 9:28)
weekend and it'll be fine but they were (9:26 - 9:30)
like no we're going all the samur right (9:28 - 9:34)
away right away and that's on a holiday (9:30 - 9:37)
weekend which you could argue that if (9:34 - 9:39)
the Eevee was there that gives people a (9:37 - 9:41)
second chance also like you're home with (9:39 - 9:43)
family that would have been like a good (9:41 - 9:44)
family (9:43 - 9:47)
raid um or a good family thing just to (9:44 - 9:50)
do like outbreaks together because this (9:47 - 9:51)
isn't talked about a lot but you can (9:50 - 9:54)
like share urbam mystica like for the (9:51 - 9:56)
like herb mystica is probably like the (9:54 - 9:58)
most in demand item anytime I post a (9:56 - 10:00)
graphic on Instagram and people are like (9:58 - 10:03)
another free Pokemon give me free urb (10:00 - 10:06)
mystica game freak they did they did (10:03 - 10:08)
give you free urb mystica like literally (10:06 - 10:10)
two months ago but it's like a very in (10:08 - 10:13)
demand item and again this is just not (10:10 - 10:14)
talked about but if in case you didn't (10:13 - 10:16)
know you can share urbom mystica I could (10:14 - 10:20)
invite Hannah and Greg I could use my (10:16 - 10:22)
urbom mystica they could get the (10:20 - 10:24)
sandwich effects and then they can leave (10:22 - 10:26)
my game and they can have the 30 minutes (10:24 - 10:29)
of like free boosted shiny ODS it's (10:26 - 10:31)
really cool (10:29 - 10:31)
and I apologize for not talking about it (10:32 - 10:37)
more but now you know Happy (10:34 - 10:37)
Thanksgiving here's your spicy herbs for (10:38 - 10:43)
your Thanksgiving (10:42 - 10:46)
meal and I'm sure like if if I spent (10:43 - 10:48)
Thanksgiving with family or if I had (10:46 - 10:52)
siblings or family that played Pokemon (10:48 - 10:54)
that'd be a cool thing to do like sit (10:52 - 10:57)
around have something on TV like jump (10:54 - 11:00)
over to my game let's make a sandwich (10:57 - 11:02)
all right you go back to yours hunt (11:00 - 11:04)
something I'll hunt whatever I want in (11:02 - 11:06)
mine it's cool it's really cool I think (11:04 - 11:07)
it's like the (11:06 - 11:10)
first game ever where you could like (11:07 - 11:16)
share boosted shiny (11:10 - 11:19)
items um (11:16 - 11:21)
regardless they did (11:19 - 11:24)
[Laughter] (11:21 - 11:28)
samuro they sure did and looking at the (11:24 - 11:31)
calendar I do think this is the less (11:28 - 11:33)
this this has to be the last seven star (11:31 - 11:35)
raid (11:33 - 11:37)
before the (11:35 - 11:39)
DLC (11:37 - 11:41)
probably because I well I guess I guess (11:39 - 11:44)
there's one extra week but then the (11:41 - 11:47)
repeat would be the weekend the DLC does (11:44 - 11:51)
come out yeah because we'll have samarat (11:47 - 11:52)
this upcoming weekend and then the (11:51 - 11:54)
following weekend is nothing and then (11:52 - 11:57)
the week after that is (11:54 - 12:00)
DLC so I I maybe they were just like we (11:57 - 12:02)
need we need to get we need to get the (12:00 - 12:03)
samur (12:02 - 12:07)
out that sounds more likely no e for two (12:03 - 12:09)
weeks because they need to get it out (12:07 - 12:12)
before the last DLC (12:09 - 12:14)
drops before I give my Impressions on (12:12 - 12:18)
samur Ro did you both get it done or you (12:14 - 12:20)
doing it this (12:18 - 12:22)
weekend uh I I got it (12:20 - 12:24)
done (12:22 - 12:28)
Friday I think I did randoms like I (12:24 - 12:31)
always do yeah I went all in with (12:28 - 12:36)
randoms uh probably six or seven times I (12:31 - 12:38)
think that I got it on the third try but (12:36 - 12:40)
then I just wanted to keep trying and (12:38 - 12:41)
seeing what people were bringing and how (12:40 - 12:43)
it was (12:41 - 12:46)
going and it was not going great oh I (12:43 - 12:49)
had a very different experience I got it (12:46 - 12:52)
on the first one and out of the seven I (12:49 - 12:56)
did I only failed one wow with randoms (12:52 - 12:59)
with randoms yeah that's crazy which po (12:56 - 13:02)
did you bring uh (12:59 - 13:04)
torta oh that's a good one that's (13:02 - 13:05)
probably why you were winning torta is (13:04 - 13:07)
good you s reflect and you're pretty (13:05 - 13:10)
golden well I would I would I did worry (13:07 - 13:13)
seed reflect oh even yeah yeah and then (13:10 - 13:15)
whatever even better yeah worry seed's a (13:13 - 13:16)
little better because if some if one of (13:15 - 13:18)
your randoms faint then the shield goes (13:16 - 13:21)
up right away yeah so I opened with (13:18 - 13:23)
worry seed because like let's just end (13:21 - 13:25)
this thing and then if I get a shot at (13:23 - 13:28)
doing reflect which I sometimes did I (13:25 - 13:31)
I'm not counting the ones where the raid (13:28 - 13:34)
just once again stopped for a minute and (13:31 - 13:36)
then when it decided to come back up (13:34 - 13:37)
everybody was dead and it was kicking us (13:36 - 13:39)
out like I don't count those because I (13:37 - 13:42)
have no idea what happened yeah um I had (13:39 - 13:45)
that and just like this is it's so (13:42 - 13:47)
frustrating that this is still happening (13:45 - 13:49)
so I don't count those but I think (13:47 - 13:51)
generally I knew like oh I'm doing (13:49 - 13:53)
random so I might as well just do as (13:51 - 13:56)
much support as I can um but there (13:53 - 14:00)
were a lot of people who who were (13:56 - 14:04)
using Victory Bell yeah uh I saw a lot (14:00 - 14:08)
of Victory Bells um who did clar smog Al (14:04 - 14:12)
so I saw a lot of that um I was in a (14:08 - 14:14)
raid with two ogre (14:12 - 14:18)
Pon that went fine it was smooth (14:14 - 14:20)
somewhat smooth uh once everything was (14:18 - 14:25)
set up uh I did a lot of raids with (14:20 - 14:30)
maridon I only had one annihilation (14:25 - 14:34)
iron hands combo in the same one in the (14:30 - 14:36)
same one yes iron hands annihilated (14:34 - 14:40)
brothers forever in the same one but the (14:36 - 14:41)
weird thing is we did that one because (14:40 - 14:45)
it was annihilate iron hands me and a (14:41 - 14:48)
victory bell so the two of us who (14:45 - 14:51)
brought Victory Bell and Tra literally (14:48 - 14:55)
saved the other two so we passed um but (14:51 - 14:56)
they weren't they you should you should (14:55 - 14:59)
have failed it now they think now you (14:56 - 15:00)
you put in their brains that like (14:59 - 15:02)
they're they're they've brought the (15:00 - 15:05)
right Pokemon to this I did and I will (15:02 - 15:09)
continue to sew that level of chaos (15:05 - 15:12)
until they fix how you look at (15:09 - 15:13)
raids (15:12 - 15:15)
um (15:13 - 15:18)
I talked about how I didn't really love (15:15 - 15:21)
the Eevee or the tyan not because they (15:18 - 15:23)
were like too hard or too easy I just (15:21 - 15:25)
didn't like really like I talked about (15:23 - 15:26)
this I didn't really like how they (15:25 - 15:30)
opened and they they both could have had (15:26 - 15:33)
like like an extra move or something to (15:30 - 15:35)
kind of up the variety instead of the (15:33 - 15:37)
tyion just being like I'm going to try (15:35 - 15:39)
to willowisp you over and over and over (15:37 - 15:42)
and you can't even be burned just like (15:39 - 15:46)
weird CPU logic um I loved this raid I (15:42 - 15:48)
thought this raid was really cool (15:46 - 15:50)
because I (15:48 - 15:50)
think I think like what makes a good (15:51 - 15:57)
raid and this is the same for like (15:55 - 15:59)
Destiny or Final Fantasy again these are (15:57 - 16:01)
the two games I compare raids to even (15:59 - 16:02)
though Pokemon raids are significantly (16:01 - 16:05)
more simple but that's fine but like I (16:02 - 16:08)
think what makes a good raid is an (16:05 - 16:12)
obvious problem that you need to (16:08 - 16:14)
solve and I don't know what the problem (16:12 - 16:16)
there I don't really know what the (16:14 - 16:19)
problem in the Eevee raid was the (16:16 - 16:21)
problem could have been the Eevee is (16:19 - 16:24)
going to yawn you and you need to deal (16:21 - 16:26)
with that and the problem in the tyion (16:24 - 16:29)
raid was like well I know the problem (16:26 - 16:30)
The tyion Raid was like it's going to (16:29 - 16:31)
burn you and infernal Parade's going to (16:30 - 16:35)
do double and it's like but what if I (16:31 - 16:37)
bring a special attacker now I don't (16:35 - 16:39)
really care about the (16:37 - 16:43)
burn but in this they give you the (16:39 - 16:46)
problem upfront which is you have to now (16:43 - 16:51)
deal with a a turn zero Swords Dance and (16:46 - 16:53)
it has a sharpness (16:51 - 17:00)
boost um and when you solve that problem (16:53 - 17:02)
you pretty much win and I think that's (17:00 - 17:05)
good I think that's great I I I like it (17:02 - 17:08)
doesn't need to be like this constant (17:05 - 17:11)
slog right like as a team we have solved (17:08 - 17:14)
the problem and now we just have to (17:11 - 17:15)
finish off the raid interesting enough (17:14 - 17:17)
this samarat had slightly more Health (17:15 - 17:20)
than other Seven Star raids um it most (17:17 - 17:24)
raids are multiplied by a 30% most raids (17:20 - 17:27)
are the health is by a 30% there's a way (17:24 - 17:30)
to say that sentence better times 30 is (17:27 - 17:33)
the health for most raid bosses Samurai (17:30 - 17:38)
had 35 um and I think Pikachu had the (17:33 - 17:42)
most health of times 50 or something you (17:38 - 17:44)
know Pikachu's based stats aren't as (17:42 - 17:47)
good as like a a final evolution but um (17:44 - 17:49)
Mewtwo probably had the most health but (17:47 - 17:51)
I I don't remember Mewtwo's multiplier (17:49 - 17:55)
off the top of my head so uh yeah the (17:51 - 17:57)
the interesting thing is you know samur (17:55 - 17:59)
Ro still had Focus energy but it didn't (17:57 - 18:01)
Focus energy until after the shield (17:59 - 18:04)
broke um The Shield went up relatively (18:01 - 18:07)
quickly yeah it did sometimes it went up (18:04 - 18:09)
real quick and I think I think Greg and (18:07 - 18:11)
I had the similar problem Greg said like (18:09 - 18:13)
the raid would lag out at the beginning (18:11 - 18:16)
what I would notice is like my very very (18:13 - 18:20)
first raid I I I brought Volcan on I did (18:16 - 18:22)
four raid builds (18:20 - 18:25)
um and Volcanion had Haze and I was like (18:22 - 18:27)
well you know in case samuro Does Swords (18:25 - 18:29)
Dance you can Haze it cool opened up (18:27 - 18:32)
with sword stands and I went to Haze but (18:29 - 18:35)
some then somebody died so the game was (18:32 - 18:37)
like no one can do anything we're like (18:35 - 18:40)
putting the shield up now so like I (18:37 - 18:43)
literally hit the haze button and then (18:40 - 18:44)
it was like nope you don't get to do (18:43 - 18:46)
that because Shield gets to go up and (18:44 - 18:48)
now you go back into the menu and it's (18:46 - 18:50)
like oh like you can see like I never (18:48 - 18:53)
used a haze PP so it never accepted my (18:50 - 18:56)
haze input y so now I have to do it (18:53 - 19:00)
again and there was just really we weird (18:56 - 19:03)
like felt like a full minute of lag and (19:00 - 19:05)
then it didn't register my haze again (19:03 - 19:07)
and then I my third time it was like (19:05 - 19:10)
okay now you hasted and uh we were still (19:07 - 19:12)
like we still won (19:10 - 19:16)
but I don't know if it's like the leg (19:12 - 19:20)
was because the shield goes up so (19:16 - 19:23)
quickly but I could I could imagine that (19:20 - 19:25)
for people who were (19:23 - 19:27)
failing and because that happened to (19:25 - 19:28)
Greg and that happened to me I'm sure it (19:27 - 19:31)
happened other people um it never (19:28 - 19:34)
happened if like no one fainted at the (19:31 - 19:38)
beginning uh I wonder how discouraging (19:34 - 19:40)
that was to people because when it (19:38 - 19:42)
happened to me I was (19:40 - 19:45)
like this is still okay like the shield (19:42 - 19:47)
went up the haze finally went through (19:45 - 19:50)
he's no longer boosted just get to (19:47 - 19:53)
terara teras and we'll totally be okay (19:50 - 19:56)
and we were but if if if you don't have (19:53 - 19:58)
like if you're playing with randoms (19:56 - 20:00)
somebody dies right away Shield goes up (19:58 - 20:02)
your game is liking you're probably (20:00 - 20:04)
you're you probably just gave up you're (20:02 - 20:05)
probably like I'm just going to put my (20:04 - 20:07)
controller down and walk away like We (20:05 - 20:10)
Lost it's not a fun experience I will (20:07 - 20:11)
say that when I know I'm going in I was (20:10 - 20:13)
also playing with Volcanion when I know (20:11 - 20:15)
I am going in and hitting a specific (20:13 - 20:18)
move first thing like Hayes I put that (20:15 - 20:20)
as the very first move in my move slots (20:18 - 20:22)
and I just go in there smashing a and (20:20 - 20:24)
get that in as quickly as possible I (20:22 - 20:29)
mean I was smashing a and still (20:24 - 20:31)
whether or not it would accept that (20:29 - 20:35)
input and then lock up or (20:31 - 20:40)
not up up up to the code to decide if (20:35 - 20:41)
I'm actually going to be allowed to do (20:40 - 20:43)
some things there are many times where (20:41 - 20:44)
I'm (20:43 - 20:47)
like it has been so long since I've been (20:44 - 20:49)
allowed to interact with the menu or see (20:47 - 20:53)
what's going on I have no clue what has (20:49 - 20:57)
been accepted what hasn't been accepted (20:53 - 20:59)
Where We Are (20:57 - 21:02)
who's who's died how many times like I (20:59 - 21:04)
have no idea when my game finally (21:02 - 21:08)
unlocks what the state of this is going (21:04 - 21:11)
to be and because I have no idea what (21:08 - 21:13)
it's going to be I have no idea how to (21:11 - 21:16)
fix it right like I don't know do I put (21:13 - 21:19)
up reflect because I'm now going to have (21:16 - 21:21)
to go in waste time trying to look to (21:19 - 21:24)
see if reflect is up because I have no (21:21 - 21:26)
clue in game if it is or not if it (21:24 - 21:28)
accepted you got to check the pp again (21:26 - 21:30)
check the pp (21:28 - 21:34)
but at that point it's like we are (21:30 - 21:41)
so far gone that there is just (21:34 - 21:47)
nah uh yeah I mean I I got over I I I I (21:41 - 21:48)
hated that I should have just sold all (21:47 - 21:50)
my water teror shards because I always (21:48 - 21:52)
use shards as like a good like how many (21:50 - 21:54)
raids did I do off the top of my head (21:52 - 21:55)
because sometimes I'll lose count but (21:54 - 21:58)
I'll be like oh I if you're getting like (21:55 - 22:02)
15 shards a raid 999 divided by 15 okay (21:58 - 22:05)
that's how many I did um but I I did (22:02 - 22:08)
over 60 raids within two days like I was (22:05 - 22:11)
I was grinding them out helping (22:08 - 22:14)
people uh I had a lot of new people come (22:11 - 22:16)
in being like hey I need help which is (22:14 - 22:17)
like totally cool I love doing that I (22:16 - 22:21)
love doing that going I I do I I think (22:17 - 22:22)
there needs to be a lot of changes to (22:21 - 22:26)
raids but I think in this (22:22 - 22:27)
example because I don't want to beat a (22:26 - 22:29)
dead horse but this example I think what (22:27 - 22:32)
the game needs to do is if the raid boss (22:29 - 22:35)
is going to have turn Zero moves which (22:32 - 22:36)
all of them has had turn Zero moves a (22:35 - 22:38)
turn zero move is a move you they do (22:36 - 22:40)
before you can even pick a move so (22:38 - 22:43)
Greninja would be like toxic spikes (22:40 - 22:45)
double team he does both of that before (22:43 - 22:48)
you can even move at all right uh they (22:45 - 22:51)
just need to not have the attack button (22:48 - 22:52)
pop (22:51 - 22:56)
up like I think it it feels like that in (22:52 - 22:58)
itself likes it out because it it pops (22:56 - 23:00)
up and a lot of players if you're quick (22:58 - 23:01)
enough can get into the menu that shows (23:00 - 23:03)
you your for moves and then all of a (23:01 - 23:06)
sudden it takes that menu away from you (23:03 - 23:08)
and it causes confusion in my opinion (23:06 - 23:10)
and it causes (23:08 - 23:13)
lag and so if you're gonna open the raid (23:10 - 23:17)
boss up just why why are you just not (23:13 - 23:20)
holding that menu back and also maybe (23:17 - 23:21)
communicate on screen what's actually (23:20 - 23:23)
happening but that's a whole different (23:21 - 23:25)
thing but I I do think that would make (23:23 - 23:27)
the start of the raid go smoother is (23:25 - 23:29)
just like okay now that the raid boss (23:27 - 23:33)
has done its things now here's your menu (23:29 - 23:36)
of what you can do I would like it if (23:33 - 23:40)
they implemented you cannot click on the (23:36 - 23:44)
raid unless your (23:40 - 23:49)
Pokemon at default is of the appropriate (23:44 - 23:53)
level okay so out of like the 60 raids I (23:49 - 23:56)
did I only failed one and the one I (23:53 - 23:57)
failed was just because somebody didn't (23:56 - 23:59)
bring a level 100 they brought like a (23:57 - 24:01)
level like 80 Appleton or something (23:59 - 24:05)
right um and they died right away (24:01 - 24:08)
and there it's it's always funny too (24:05 - 24:10)
because I'll like do raid builds and I (24:08 - 24:12)
specifically make four Pokemon that work (24:10 - 24:15)
together and like this one will contr (24:12 - 24:16)
this one will put up the reflect this (24:15 - 24:19)
one will heal this one will clear Smog (24:16 - 24:21)
or Haze also weep in Bell was better (24:19 - 24:23)
than Victory belt all these Victory Bell (24:21 - 24:25)
builds out there like (24:23 - 24:29)
evolite weeping Bell was better (24:25 - 24:31)
also weeping Bells a significantly cuter (24:29 - 24:32)
Pokemon (24:31 - 24:35)
what oh he's so great I have I have like (24:32 - 24:38)
this Japanese weep and Bell sticker from (24:35 - 24:40)
Japan I don't remember what the Japanese (24:38 - 24:41)
says it's some like pun about how like (24:40 - 24:43)
weep and Bell has like a big mouth or I (24:41 - 24:45)
don't know weep Bell's awesome weeping (24:43 - 24:46)
Bell with eite was much better than (24:45 - 24:49)
vicell I'm gonna turn you over to James (24:46 - 24:51)
and you gonna have a (24:49 - 24:53)
conversation vicory Bell has that weird (24:51 - 24:54)
screech in the anime which is like kind (24:53 - 24:57)
of cool I'm into that but like it's a (24:54 - 24:59)
very good Screech I think that the (24:57 - 25:02)
difference is weeping Bell looks lost in (24:59 - 25:04)
its facial expressions and victory bell (25:02 - 25:09)
looks scary are using your derp factor (25:04 - 25:11)
to decide that something is better than (25:09 - 25:13)
the other you just like it cuz it's (25:11 - 25:16)
Derpy not because it's actually better (25:13 - 25:18)
you're just like the Derp Face is the (25:16 - 25:21)
way to go and I'm calling you out right (25:18 - 25:22)
here right (25:21 - 25:25)
now (25:22 - 25:29)
um my I I do I do have this like sense (25:25 - 25:34)
of responsibility and I do feel bad when (25:29 - 25:36)
I make raid builds I I I genuinely do (25:34 - 25:38)
feel bad I make I make these raid builds (25:36 - 25:40)
and then somebody tells me it's not (25:38 - 25:45)
working for them and I can (25:40 - 25:45)
only I can't hold everyone's hand I mean (25:45 - 25:51)
I wish I could it can only do so much (25:48 - 25:54)
right I can only do so much so like um (25:51 - 25:57)
for example I think I made a YouTube (25:54 - 26:00)
video cuz you can you also can only (25:57 - 26:02)
convey so much in like a Instagram post (26:00 - 26:04)
right like a graphic that I put on (26:02 - 26:07)
Twitter like uh you can see like I put (26:04 - 26:11)
six moves on my graphic and (26:07 - 26:13)
if like I had like some people be like (26:11 - 26:16)
oh why is worc here like oh you don't (26:13 - 26:19)
know what wor SE does um well I I I (26:16 - 26:21)
guess you could look it up or I don't (26:19 - 26:22)
have really room on the graphic to (26:21 - 26:24)
explain what it does but it's very (26:22 - 26:27)
important it removes sharpness but like (26:24 - 26:29)
in my in my in my video I originally had (26:27 - 26:32)
light screen on Appleton and in my video (26:29 - 26:35)
I says like I said like we we have one (26:32 - 26:37)
person that we have one Pokemon that has (26:35 - 26:39)
light screen and it has light screen (26:37 - 26:41)
just in case that samro has any special (26:39 - 26:43)
type moves and if it doesn't have light (26:41 - 26:45)
screen feel free to switch this to (26:43 - 26:47)
reflect that's what I said in my video (26:45 - 26:48)
and (26:47 - 26:51)
so um there was an apple tin that came (26:48 - 26:52)
through and they put up light screen (26:51 - 26:54)
right away and it was you know I was (26:52 - 26:57)
like hey you don't need this anymore um (26:54 - 26:58)
so that's that's what I'm talking about (26:57 - 27:01)
like like I can't 100% hold your hand on (26:58 - 27:04)
that but I get I get I guess you did it (27:01 - 27:06)
to my graphic but I think a thing that (27:04 - 27:09)
people don't know I know people don't (27:06 - 27:11)
know because I I I tell people this all (27:09 - 27:12)
the time and they're like oh I didn't (27:11 - 27:14)
know this is the raid boss will only (27:12 - 27:16)
attack you when you attack it with the (27:14 - 27:18)
exception of like you know obviously (27:16 - 27:20)
Cinder I high jump kicks everyone at the (27:18 - 27:22)
very start right like that's what it (27:20 - 27:25)
does so that first like ceaseless Edge (27:22 - 27:28)
or EXs or or razor shell it will only do (27:25 - 27:32)
that when you attack it and that's why (27:28 - 27:36)
people fail the six-star anap because (27:32 - 27:37)
the annihilate will focus energy and (27:36 - 27:41)
turn one not turn zero but if somebody (27:37 - 27:44)
else is faster than the taunter that (27:41 - 27:46)
triggers (27:44 - 27:48)
annihilates reason to focus (27:46 - 27:52)
energy so there were some people like (27:48 - 27:54)
the the funny thing is like for every (27:52 - 27:56)
like person that tweeted at me like your (27:54 - 27:58)
go-o build sucks I died right away (27:56 - 27:59)
somebody else would then like lit if I (27:58 - 28:01)
go through my like mentions somebody (27:59 - 28:03)
else was like loved your go- go build (28:01 - 28:04)
got it on the first try it was like (28:03 - 28:08)
literally like the (28:04 - 28:10)
D it was like Twitter in a nutshell it's (28:08 - 28:12)
like somebody be like your go- goat (28:10 - 28:13)
sucks and then somebody been like your (28:12 - 28:19)
go- goat was great yeah um so like go go (28:13 - 28:23)
needed to wait for a haze or reflect or (28:19 - 28:26)
a worry seed and then once that happened (28:23 - 28:28)
go go was indestructible but if go go (28:26 - 28:31)
tried to go before that then it would (28:28 - 28:32)
take too much damage because it needed (28:31 - 28:34)
to wait (28:32 - 28:38)
so if you brought the wrong Pokemon to a (28:34 - 28:40)
raid which totally happens I brought a (28:38 - 28:43)
landeras to like a six-star dust Noir (28:40 - 28:45)
the other day and then I didn't realize (28:43 - 28:47)
that the dust Noir had ice punch until (28:45 - 28:49)
it was too late and I was like oh this (28:47 - 28:51)
is a terrible (28:49 - 28:54)
Choice four times weak to ice punch I (28:51 - 28:56)
had no clue that out of all the moves (28:54 - 28:58)
that dusn would know it would have ice (28:56 - 29:01)
punch and I brought landeras here (28:58 - 29:04)
but it was it was a poison dust Noir for (29:01 - 29:05)
the record I was like ah ground is super (29:04 - 29:08)
effective against poison um so if you (29:05 - 29:11)
did bring the wrong Pokemon you could (29:08 - 29:12)
literally just set down your controller (29:11 - 29:14)
and not do anything and you are less (29:12 - 29:16)
likely to die eventually The Raid boss (29:14 - 29:17)
will be like oh you've been idling out (29:16 - 29:19)
for too long I'm going to attack you but (29:17 - 29:21)
literally if you don't attack it it (29:19 - 29:24)
doesn't attack you so there's a lot of (29:21 - 29:28)
situations where this is important so (29:24 - 29:30)
even if the takeaway was like if even if (29:28 - 29:31)
you're listening you're like Steve (29:30 - 29:33)
you're L your your your go- goat still (29:31 - 29:36)
sucks that's fine you can say that I I I (29:33 - 29:39)
think goo's a good boy so shame on you (29:36 - 29:43)
but that strategy that (29:39 - 29:46)
tactic applies to any raid going forward (29:43 - 29:48)
right even if you were an Appleton (29:46 - 29:50)
setting reflect or a torta setting (29:48 - 29:52)
reflect and you don't want to take that (29:50 - 29:54)
much damage for whatever reason you (29:52 - 29:56)
could just wait for the Volcanion to (29:54 - 29:58)
Haze like literally literally as soon as (29:56 - 30:00)
you see that little Haze pop up in the (29:58 - 30:03)
upper left hand corner and then you hit (30:00 - 30:06)
reflect it now determines the turn (30:03 - 30:07)
order (30:06 - 30:09)
[Music] (30:07 - 30:11)
um and if you were to hit reflect in the (30:09 - 30:13)
haze but you see the haze go off but the (30:11 - 30:17)
reflect it's the game is really bad at (30:13 - 30:20)
like listing what is happening which is (30:17 - 30:22)
crazy because Legends archus literally (30:20 - 30:25)
had the turn order in the top right (30:22 - 30:28)
corner but like if you know you're a (30:25 - 30:29)
weaker Pokemon and you know somebody (30:28 - 30:32)
else is going to Haze or reflect or (30:29 - 30:36)
light screen or whatever or or heel (30:32 - 30:37)
chair (30:36 - 30:41)
even if it's okay to wait like literally (30:37 - 30:43)
3 seconds for you to see that in the (30:41 - 30:44)
upper thing because the boss is not (30:43 - 30:46)
going to do anything until you hit the (30:44 - 30:49)
button and I guess if anything from the (30:46 - 30:50)
samuro (30:49 - 30:53)
conversation you want to take away from (30:50 - 30:55)
it's that it's like liter like it's not (30:53 - 30:57)
a race the B like the boss is only get (30:55 - 30:59)
going to do as many moves as you do to (30:57 - 31:02)
it so it's not like oh if I don't if I (30:59 - 31:03)
don't press the button I'm just it's (31:02 - 31:04)
going to just ceaseless Edge me over no (31:03 - 31:08)
it's not going to it's not (31:04 - 31:12)
um be nice if the game explained any (31:08 - 31:12)
of would be nice if it did a whole lot (31:13 - 31:18)
of things that could make these raids (31:15 - 31:20)
better but that that's okay that's okay (31:18 - 31:22)
like (31:20 - 31:25)
I whatever like I I still love helping (31:22 - 31:27)
people and people coming in and and (31:25 - 31:29)
doing it (31:27 - 31:31)
and I at the end of the day I thought it (31:29 - 31:34)
was a fun grade I thought it was great (31:31 - 31:35)
and I think like finally it clicked with (31:34 - 31:36)
me of (31:35 - 31:39)
like the they put the problem right up (31:36 - 31:42)
front and as a team if you can solve (31:39 - 31:43)
that problem within the first I don't (31:42 - 31:46)
know like two and a half turns three (31:43 - 31:50)
turns usually the like I I I don't (31:46 - 31:52)
think I mean I I I already said I only (31:50 - 31:53)
failed the raid once and it was cuz (31:52 - 31:55)
somebody brought like a level 80 (31:53 - 31:57)
Appleton but like I don't know how you (31:55 - 31:59)
would fail the raid in the the second (31:57 - 32:01)
half like if you've solved the problem (31:59 - 32:03)
in the first half I guess like yeah (32:01 - 32:06)
maybe the focus energy kicks in and and (32:03 - 32:10)
you get crit RNG crit like a million (32:06 - 32:12)
times (32:10 - 32:14)
but it was good it was like a it was a (32:12 - 32:17)
good upfront problem to solve and it was (32:14 - 32:19)
more unique than the other raids because (32:17 - 32:24)
they put they put that issue on turn (32:19 - 32:24)
zero (32:26 - 32:30)
so (32:28 - 32:33)
um cool well let's take a break uh when (32:30 - 32:35)
we come back uh let's talk we'll talk (32:33 - 32:39)
about a $30,000 Pikachu necklace I well (32:35 - 32:41)
I don't want it but I want part I want I (32:39 - 32:44)
want I want things from it there I have (32:41 - 32:48)
I have things okay we'll be right (32:44 - 32:53)
back and we are back from our break oh I (32:48 - 32:54)
had one more thing about the the the (32:53 - 32:56)
holding people's hands for samur I (32:54 - 32:59)
thought of this as on break uh I did (32:56 - 33:01)
have a a couple people come in they're (32:59 - 33:05)
like oh my my applon is getting one (33:01 - 33:08)
shot I built it exactly as what you said (33:05 - 33:10)
which to me didn't make any sense (33:08 - 33:13)
because I ran the Cs so it wouldn't get (33:10 - 33:14)
one (33:13 - 33:17)
shot and I was (33:14 - 33:20)
like I don't I'm not saying you're a (33:17 - 33:23)
liar also this is no sh to those people (33:20 - 33:25)
but like is like you know in my head I'm (33:23 - 33:28)
like is it bold is it level 100 (33:25 - 33:32)
did you Eevee train it did you Ivy train (33:28 - 33:34)
it did you hyper train it which was a (33:32 - 33:35)
thing that every one of those people (33:34 - 33:38)
forgot you got to go to the you got to (33:35 - 33:42)
go to the snow the person in mon Vera or (33:38 - 33:44)
however you say it and I don't even (33:42 - 33:46)
think the person has a name they're just (33:44 - 33:48)
standing next to the Obamas sna and you (33:46 - 33:50)
talk to them and then you can hypertrain (33:48 - 33:53)
it and it's a it's it's a night and day (33:50 - 33:56)
difference when you hypertrain your (33:53 - 34:00)
defense stat in your HP stat so that was (33:56 - 34:02)
like again this is me going back to like (34:00 - 34:04)
I can you can yell at me that my RAID (34:02 - 34:08)
build suck I can't I can't play the game (34:04 - 34:09)
for (34:08 - 34:12)
you (34:09 - 34:12)
um but also like make sure you (34:13 - 34:18)
hypertrain your (34:15 - 34:21)
Pokemon it's it's very it's very helpful (34:18 - 34:22)
uh it's (34:21 - 34:24)
important you know what else is (34:22 - 34:28)
important expensive collaborations (34:24 - 34:29)
yeah (34:28 - 34:33)
baby there was there was two of them I (34:29 - 34:36)
remember the very first time I've ever (34:33 - 34:39)
walked into a Tiffany in company it was (34:36 - 34:41)
in Boston was my very first time in (34:39 - 34:44)
Boston and the hotel I booked off (34:41 - 34:46)
Hotwire you ever used (34:44 - 34:50)
Hotwire I have like a million years ago (34:46 - 34:51)
but yeah yeah so for those that don't (34:50 - 34:55)
know Hotwire is is a hotel service that (34:51 - 34:56)
gives you a hotel but doesn't tell you (34:55 - 34:58)
what the hotel hotel is until you (34:56 - 35:01)
already pay for it and the gimmick is (34:58 - 35:05)
that you pick an area on the map this is (35:01 - 35:06)
this is how (35:05 - 35:11)
you did our Boston trip yes it sounds (35:06 - 35:12)
like how you get (35:11 - 35:14)
bed no cuz you (35:12 - 35:18)
can you C you can say like I only want (35:14 - 35:20)
four star and higher hotels in this area (35:18 - 35:23)
or I only or I like I want a I want a (35:20 - 35:25)
two star hotel and this I've (35:23 - 35:29)
NE not me not me book (35:25 - 35:33)
start cuz I I am terrified of I'm I'm (35:29 - 35:37)
already like a germaphobe uh so you you (35:33 - 35:40)
pick an area and then you you say your (35:37 - 35:42)
budget and then it'll say like you might (35:40 - 35:44)
get it'll give you some suggestions but (35:42 - 35:46)
you can also like I guess the trick to (35:44 - 35:49)
hotwire is like you can go to Google (35:46 - 35:51)
Maps and then type in hotels in the area (35:49 - 35:52)
and see like what you're working with (35:51 - 35:54)
and be like well these are the only two (35:52 - 35:57)
fourstar hotels in this area so it it's (35:54 - 36:00)
either these two and then at the end of (35:57 - 36:02)
the day what who cares like it's just a (36:00 - 36:04)
room you're staying in so but the the (36:02 - 36:05)
concept is you're supposed to get a (36:04 - 36:07)
lower price because you can't cancel it (36:05 - 36:10)
so you like spin the roulette (36:07 - 36:13)
wheel and then you're good to go also (36:10 - 36:17)
Greg that while we did get uh a hotel (36:13 - 36:19)
that was kind of far away it was (36:17 - 36:21)
significantly cheaper than the would (36:19 - 36:23)
have just got getting the price by (36:21 - 36:27)
itself for the record saved money uh do (36:23 - 36:30)
you want me to remind you about the bus (36:27 - 36:32)
ride from said hotel that nearly got us (36:30 - 36:38)
killed was that price worth our life no (36:32 - 36:40)
it was not had nothing to do with the (36:38 - 36:43)
hotel I mean I guess the hotel location (36:40 - 36:45)
in a hotel that was next to the (36:43 - 36:47)
convention center we would have been on (36:45 - 36:50)
that bus do not tell me that had nothing (36:47 - 36:53)
to do that hotel it was a direct it's a (36:50 - 36:56)
straight line to us nearly dying in (36:53 - 36:58)
Boston that bus was one of my favorite (36:56 - 36:59)
memories with you don't you dare take (36:58 - 37:02)
that (36:59 - 37:07)
away um anyways I hot wired a hotel and (37:02 - 37:09)
that hotel was attached to a Tiffany and (37:07 - 37:13)
Company and I walked down into it and I (37:09 - 37:16)
wanted to throw up at the cost oh it's (37:13 - 37:19)
expensive of everything in that store I (37:16 - 37:21)
don't even think nowadays you can walk (37:19 - 37:22)
into a Tiffany and Company without an (37:21 - 37:25)
appointment I feel like all these stores (37:22 - 37:29)
have like bodyguards at the front (37:25 - 37:29)
at least in Vegas like in Vegas Vegas is (37:30 - 37:38)
Vegas Yes they everything (37:34 - 37:41)
Vegas I think Mall of America has a (37:38 - 37:44)
couple luxury (37:41 - 37:44)
stores Yeah couple I mean coach is (37:45 - 37:52)
technically luxury I mean (37:49 - 37:52)
technically anyways our listeners are (37:53 - 37:57)
like why are you talking about Tiffany (37:56 - 38:00)
and Company the reason we are is because (37:57 - 38:02)
Tiffany and Company partnered up with (38:00 - 38:04)
Pokemon well this is like a three-way (38:02 - 38:06)
collab (38:04 - 38:08)
technically um I I just got the article (38:06 - 38:12)
here off IGN also Ryan (38:08 - 38:16)
Dale I don't like your sub heading of (38:12 - 38:19)
poly swag because pwag is not I mean I (38:16 - 38:22)
get the joke but Poliwag is not featured (38:19 - 38:24)
in this (38:22 - 38:27)
collaboration I'm upset uh the Pokemon (38:24 - 38:29)
company and t uh Tiffany the Pokemon (38:27 - 38:30)
company and Tiffany and Company have (38:29 - 38:32)
teamed up to release Pokemon jewelry (38:30 - 38:34)
jewelry with the most expensive piece (38:32 - 38:36)
being (38:34 - 38:38)
$29,000 uh the collection features nine (38:36 - 38:41)
pieces the cheapest being (38:38 - 38:43)
$1,290 the most expensive naturally a (38:41 - 38:46)
Pikachu coming with the $29,000 price (38:43 - 38:49)
tag this pricey one is a Pikachu pendant (38:46 - 38:52)
made of 18 karat yellow (38:49 - 38:54)
gold I I don't know what car I don't (38:52 - 38:56)
know like the weight distribution of (38:54 - 38:58)
carrots to money and diamond accents (38:56 - 39:00)
that come in two size the standard (38:58 - 39:04)
29,000 one $29,000 one and then there's (39:00 - 39:06)
a smaller version of this which is (39:04 - 39:10)
exactly the same it's is smaller of (39:06 - 39:10)
$99,900 seven Ox oxidized sterling (39:10 - 39:17)
silver pendants with diamond accents are (39:15 - 39:20)
also available six featuring Pokemon six (39:17 - 39:22)
featuring individual Pokémon priced at (39:20 - 39:23)
the cheap (39:22 - 39:26)
$1,290 and the seventh featuring all of (39:23 - 39:28)
them together (39:26 - 39:32)
um which the Pokemon are (39:28 - 39:33)
Cubone (39:32 - 39:39)
Charmander Mew Pikachu Jigglypuff and (39:33 - 39:41)
Squirtle what happened to Bulbasaur (39:39 - 39:44)
during any of this who knows I was so (39:41 - 39:48)
frustrated by that denied left (39:44 - 39:52)
out usually jiggly puff gets a free pass (39:48 - 39:54)
for whatever I don't know anime reasons (39:52 - 39:58)
or whatever uh I don't know how made I (39:54 - 40:00)
mean like Cubone again kind of gets like (39:58 - 40:05)
a free pass cuz super cute sure but what (40:00 - 40:07)
happened to Bubbles I think these are (40:05 - 40:09)
all based on the statues that were made (40:07 - 40:12)
by the artist I think Daniel Aram or (40:09 - 40:14)
something like that yeah I think that (40:12 - 40:15)
these are all based on statues that (40:14 - 40:17)
already existed on art pieces that (40:15 - 40:20)
already existed and just cast from that (40:17 - 40:22)
yeah did and also that artist has worked (40:20 - 40:24)
with Tiffany and Co two times before (40:22 - 40:26)
this apparently did he never make a (40:24 - 40:29)
Bulbasaur (40:26 - 40:32)
one don't (40:29 - 40:34)
know but it seems like he was Pokemon's (40:32 - 40:37)
way into collabing with (40:34 - 40:39)
Tiffany yeah (40:37 - 40:43)
it it's not weird as in (40:39 - 40:43)
like the Pokemon collabed with Tiffany (40:43 - 40:50)
it's weird that it's like Tiffany and (40:46 - 40:52)
Daniel and the Pokemon company like it (40:50 - 40:53)
would (40:52 - 40:56)
be it's like whatever like three the (40:53 - 40:56)
three of us are talking about the this (40:56 - 40:59)
like any of us can afford it we can't um (40:56 - 41:01)
that Pikachu necklace costs more than (40:59 - 41:03)
all of my student loans combined do at (41:01 - 41:07)
the moment all I'm saying is I (41:03 - 41:08)
can (41:07 - 41:11)
technically (41:08 - 41:15)
afford the if if some of the prices are (41:11 - 41:18)
correct I could technically afford the (41:15 - 41:21)
Cubone oxidized (41:18 - 41:25)
one but the only thing I want is the (41:21 - 41:27)
Pokeball yeah (41:25 - 41:29)
look I'm (41:27 - 41:31)
sure I'm sure you can find the Pokéball (41:29 - 41:34)
on eBay in a week or two for probably (41:31 - 41:34)
like (41:34 - 41:38)
$800 oh no 800 seems really low they're (41:34 - 41:39)
gonna they're gonna they're going to (41:38 - 41:40)
mark that up they're going to go over (41:39 - 41:41)
what they pay because they need to make (41:40 - 41:44)
a profit on it I feel like the Pokeball (41:41 - 41:46)
is only going to come with the $29,000 (41:44 - 41:47)
Pikachu (41:46 - 41:49)
necklace uh I know no no the Pokeball (41:47 - 41:51)
does come with the $9,000 Pikachu (41:49 - 41:52)
necklace I don't know if it comes with (41:51 - 41:55)
the charms wa yeah that's the question (41:52 - 41:58)
does it come with the charms (41:55 - 42:01)
uh I say this theoretically because I'm (41:58 - 42:03)
not spending this money for that I am (42:01 - 42:07)
not doing that that (42:03 - 42:07)
is it's cute and it's like it's like (42:08 - 42:14)
it's like when I was looking up could I (42:12 - 42:16)
actually buy the Pea bug and I (42:14 - 42:17)
technically could have afforded one of (42:16 - 42:19)
the Pika bugs when it was on sale like I (42:17 - 42:21)
could have you have to have a Volkswagen (42:19 - 42:24)
beat and like attempt to fix that thing (42:21 - 42:27)
every six months (42:24 - 42:29)
but again it's just (42:27 - 42:32)
like look the pikab bug is better than (42:29 - 42:36)
the ugly Lugia PT Cruiser that thing was (42:32 - 42:40)
garbage well yeah because the PT Cruiser (42:36 - 42:45)
is ugly PT Cruis so bad when it released (42:40 - 42:47)

an adult I Now understand my mom has the (42:47 - 42:51)
worst taste in (42:49 - 42:54)

APC that's not not that surprising I (44:55 - 45:00)
don't follow (44:57 - 45:03)
luxury so you have the Balenciaga (45:00 - 45:05)
newsletter come into your mailbox I mean (45:03 - 45:08)
will probably does because I found out (45:05 - 45:09)
that that is a thing that will does but (45:08 - 45:12)
I do (45:09 - 45:14)
not (45:12 - 45:17)
uh you know times are tough for people (45:14 - 45:20)
you know inflation a little (45:17 - 45:24)
high so I I can understand the (45:20 - 45:28)
uh the complaints of you want me to (45:24 - 45:31)
spend $120 on a single (45:28 - 45:34)
t-shirt a t-shirt (45:31 - 45:38)
that isn't cute isn't that great oh (45:34 - 45:42)
sorry not 120 my $1 130 (45:38 - 45:46)
130 the woman's t-shirt is 120 there you (45:42 - 45:50)
go less cotton or whatever material (45:46 - 45:53)
they're making it $240 for a sweater um (45:50 - 45:58)
$300 for a denim jacket (45:53 - 46:00)
uh so anyways Tiffany and Company (45:58 - 46:03)
APC (46:00 - 46:03)
um this is not the first time the (46:04 - 46:08)
Pokemon company has partnered with (46:06 - 46:11)
luxury Brands they partnered with longm (46:08 - 46:12)
long long I don't know how to say it (46:11 - 46:14)
long (46:12 - 46:14)
champ uh for for those those backpacks (46:15 - 46:21)
um they've also partnered with like (46:20 - 46:25)
non-luxury stuff like Converse and Levis (46:21 - 46:28)
and I don't consider the Northface (46:25 - 46:30)
luxury I don't think it (46:28 - 46:36)
is uh not particularly it's mid yeah (46:30 - 46:38)
it's (46:36 - 46:38)
midrange I also like I I also understand (46:38 - 46:45)
that (46:43 - 46:45)
like like really really nice luxury is (46:45 - 46:51)
more minimal um so like a really good (46:48 - 46:55)
example of this is that I I I'll use (46:51 - 47:00)
coaches an example like a nicer Coach (46:55 - 47:03)
bag usually the coach logo is smaller (47:00 - 47:05)
versus a cheaper Coach bag where like it (47:03 - 47:08)
says like coach like a million times on (47:05 - 47:09)
the bag I can't remember what they call (47:08 - 47:13)
that it's actually like some weird study (47:09 - 47:15)
of (47:13 - 47:18)
like poor this sounds I'm not this don't (47:15 - 47:21)
mean to offend anyone it like the luxury (47:18 - 47:25)
people want to appeal to poor people mhm (47:21 - 47:29)
so put they put their logo on everything (47:25 - 47:32)
cuz that's like the budget luxury so (47:29 - 47:34)
like if you see somebody with like a (47:32 - 47:35)
Gucci shirt that says like Gucci (47:34 - 47:38)
everywhere it's like probably like it's (47:35 - 47:40)
probably still like a $100 shirt but (47:38 - 47:42)
like a really nice Gucci shirt you won't (47:40 - 47:44)
even see Gucci and that shirt's probably (47:42 - 47:48)
like $1,000 it's like this weird like (47:44 - 47:52)
intro to luxury kind of thing um that's (47:48 - 47:53)
there's a whole another conversation (47:52 - 47:55)
about like the actual quality of this (47:53 - 48:00)
stuff cuz like like I I I I don't know (47:55 - 48:02)
um (48:00 - 48:06)
but in the case of APC this makes sense (48:02 - 48:09)
because like I'm sure they're trying I'm (48:06 - 48:11)
sure all of their Partnerships is just (48:09 - 48:15)
to get brand awareness of AP (48:11 - 48:18)
PC uh and the same thing happened with (48:15 - 48:20)
the oh gosh what was that we talked (48:18 - 48:22)
about it it was like some rappers (48:20 - 48:26)
brand and it was they sent me a shirt (48:22 - 48:29)
the shirt was $50 which isn't like (48:26 - 48:31)
significantly cheaper than $130 but I (48:29 - 48:32)
was like I I would never pay $50 for a (48:31 - 48:34)
t-shirt mostly because I always have (48:32 - 48:36)
hoodies on anyways you wouldn't even be (48:34 - 48:37)
able to see my t-shirt (48:36 - 48:42)
but like I feel like $30 maybe $35 is (48:37 - 48:45)
where I draw the line on a t-shirt that (48:42 - 48:47)
me personally back in my day t-shirts (48:45 - 48:50)
used to be $20 at Hot Topic but $50 for (48:47 - 48:55)
a t-shirt is a lot to me um and they (48:50 - 48:58)
sent me that t-shirt (48:55 - 48:58)
and I maybe it's nicer it doesn't feel (48:58 - 49:06)
nicer than the other t-shirts but I (49:02 - 49:07)
again I understand that you're paying (49:06 - 49:11)
for a brand you're paying for whatever (49:07 - 49:13)
like I get (49:11 - 49:16)
it like if if you're looking at the APC (49:13 - 49:17)
stuff and you're like why is this it's (49:16 - 49:21)
not for you it's it's if anything the (49:17 - 49:23)
only thing APC did what they wanted to (49:21 - 49:25)
accomplish people are now talking about (49:23 - 49:26)
APC (49:25 - 49:28)
they now know it exists you're now (49:26 - 49:30)
looking at their (49:28 - 49:33)
stuff more people APC has been around (49:30 - 49:37)
since 87 like they are a big privately (49:33 - 49:41)
owned fashioned house right they are (49:37 - 49:45)
making themselves so they (49:41 - 49:48)
are this is going to be this is so (49:45 - 49:50)
fashion weirdness but they are a ready (49:48 - 49:51)
to (49:50 - 49:56)
wear high-end luxury fashion design so (49:51 - 49:59)
they make things that you can pick off (49:56 - 50:01)
pick up off the rack and put on so (49:59 - 50:03)
they're ready to wear they're ready to (50:01 - 50:05)
wear highend (50:03 - 50:09)
fashion which is a whole thing separate (50:05 - 50:10)
like the whole like you talk about how (50:09 - 50:14)
ready to wear it is (50:10 - 50:14)
but this is again an effort to broaden (50:14 - 50:23)
their Market to get more people aware of (50:19 - 50:28)
their other ready to wear items (50:23 - 50:30)
so I would say that they are unknown (50:28 - 50:33)
they are very well known uh like if you (50:30 - 50:37)
follow high-end luxury and ready to wear (50:33 - 50:39)
stuff I'm sure you have heard of APC (50:37 - 50:41)
they've been around for a very long time (50:39 - 50:44)
but this is a way to expand their brand (50:41 - 50:48)
out and also predominantly show the (50:44 - 50:53)
types of things they make to a larger (50:48 - 50:56)
audience I also found your study about (50:53 - 51:00)
logos and it's interesting because it (50:56 - 51:02)
start I was making it up no but here's (51:00 - 51:04)
the thing that you that you missed it (51:02 - 51:06)
starts (51:04 - 51:10)
small get big and then once it crosses a (51:06 - 51:13)
threshold it shrinks again yeah yeah (51:10 - 51:15)
yeah yeah yeah and apparently it's for (51:13 - 51:18)
every they like measured this for every (51:15 - 51:21)
$55,000 increase in price the logo would (51:18 - 51:23)
shrink by a (51:21 - 51:27)
centimeter so the IDE idea (51:23 - 51:31)
is the the psychology behind it (51:27 - 51:35)
is when people see the tiny logo on a (51:31 - 51:38)
very expensive price they all like only (51:35 - 51:41)
people in the know would know why that (51:38 - 51:44)
small and then AO automatically know oh (51:41 - 51:46)
you spent a lot of money on that it is (51:44 - 51:49)
weird (51:46 - 51:52)
psychological like projection that (51:49 - 51:56)
happens like um Mark Zuckerberg (51:52 - 51:59)
his the t-shirts that he wears are like (51:56 - 52:03)
$680 each and if you if if you've (51:59 - 52:06)
purchase that t-shirt you would know (52:03 - 52:08)
exactly that he's wearing it when he (52:06 - 52:12)
walks out but like a a poor person like (52:08 - 52:15)
me like that that was the first time I (52:12 - 52:16)
heard of it it was like oh his t-shirt's (52:15 - 52:18)
that much because it there's no branding (52:16 - 52:20)
on it there's nothing on it that (52:18 - 52:23)
signifies that this is a luxury (52:20 - 52:26)
t-shirt um but at the same time you look (52:23 - 52:27)
at it and you're like ah it's just like (52:26 - 52:31)
a blue shirt (52:27 - 52:35)
yeah and we can all talk about if luxury (52:31 - 52:37)
brands are (52:35 - 52:40)
actually the quality of the items are (52:37 - 52:42)
actually worth what you're paying for (52:40 - 52:45)
and in there are I will say this there (52:42 - 52:47)
are definitely some Brands out there (52:45 - 52:49)
where you're paying a (52:47 - 52:53)
higher dollar point for something that (52:49 - 52:56)
lasts a lot longer like yeah I will buy (52:53 - 52:59)
more expensive jeans that will last me (52:56 - 53:02)
five years that will cost less than (52:59 - 53:05)
buying let's say like Target jeans that (53:02 - 53:08)
I have to replace every year so like I'm (53:05 - 53:12)
spending $50 for five years or spending (53:08 - 53:15)
$200 not like I think work I think work (53:12 - 53:17)
boots are like the better analogy yeah (53:15 - 53:20)
because like you because you could buy a (53:17 - 53:22)
$80 pair of work work boots that you (53:20 - 53:24)
have to replace every year or you could (53:22 - 53:27)
buy $300 pair of work (53:24 - 53:30)
boots and then after that will last you (53:27 - 53:34)
you know five years and then you know 80 (53:30 - 53:35)
Time 5 I can't do the math but it's more (53:34 - 53:37)
than (53:35 - 53:40)
300 that would really do fall apart yeah (53:37 - 53:44)
but I really I my jeans fall apart so (53:40 - 53:47)
just be real I'm hard on jeans y'all (53:44 - 53:49)
Hannah go ahead I just want Pokemon (53:47 - 53:52)
shirts with actual fun Pokemon designs (53:49 - 53:55)
on them I don't know I'm sitting here (53:52 - 53:56)
like a deer in headlights because I (53:55 - 53:58)
don't even know how to conceptualize (53:56 - 53:59)
things that cost this much a brand logo (53:58 - 54:02)
getting smaller every $5,000 the biggest (53:59 - 54:03)
purchase I've ever made is my computer (54:02 - 54:05)
and it wasn't that much but I just want (54:03 - 54:09)
a Pokemon shirt with a with a fun (54:05 - 54:11)
Pokemon design on it I want them to take (54:09 - 54:13)
the clothing out of scarlet and violet (54:11 - 54:15)
the Pokemon designs the ones that (54:13 - 54:17)
actually have Pokemon on them like the (54:15 - 54:20)
pal and Toros shirt and things like that (54:17 - 54:23)
and I want those to be (54:20 - 54:26)
available yeah I think (54:23 - 54:29)
I I I I think you would maybe qualify (54:26 - 54:32)
the hundreds as a luxury brand they did (54:29 - 54:36)
a collab that we talked about um I I (54:32 - 54:38)
believe their their hoodies were like (54:36 - 54:41)
120 which now I don't know everything (54:38 - 54:44)
feels expensive um but that was I think (54:41 - 54:47)
that was one of the cooler collabs again (54:44 - 54:49)
for for me and a lot of people it was (54:47 - 54:50)
like oh I've never heard of the hundreds (54:49 - 54:52)
now I have they did a collab with (54:50 - 54:55)
Pokemon and I I completely agree with (54:52 - 54:58)
Hannah I I think there's like there's a (54:55 - 55:01)
there's a balance between like slapping (54:58 - 55:03)
Pikachu on a (55:01 - 55:06)
shirt and it like being minimal because (55:03 - 55:08)
this is what the APC stuff is is like (55:06 - 55:12)
yeah it's not a lot here um even the APC (55:08 - 55:14)
ones are designed a little bit more the (55:12 - 55:16)
Pokemon are actually jumping on the logo (55:14 - 55:18)
they're not just slapped on there but (55:16 - 55:21)
for the hundreds there was a a Pikachu (55:18 - 55:24)
cardigan and it was just Pikachu's face (55:21 - 55:27)
and it was very simple but it was like (55:24 - 55:29)
good it was like a clean simple it was (55:27 - 55:31)
like oh this is simple but like subtle (55:29 - 55:34)
but not like I I wanted it I was like oh (55:31 - 55:37)
I've I you know I I don't own a cardigan (55:34 - 55:39)
uh I like the way this cardigan looks (55:37 - 55:41)
it's a little expensive but you know (55:39 - 55:43)
I'll treat myself this one time maybe (55:41 - 55:46)
it's actually as nice as the price says (55:43 - 55:48)
it is and then it like sold out like (55:46 - 55:50)
instantly so like there there's there's (55:48 - 55:52)
clearly a market right you know you see (55:50 - 55:55)
this with the hundreds like that release (55:52 - 55:57)
sold out instantly the one with the (55:55 - 56:00)
Mewtwo from the gosh I can't remember (55:57 - 56:03)
that brand um it was like the streete (56:00 - 56:06)
wear oh right wait right wait wait I (56:03 - 56:09)
don't remember um that release sold out (56:06 - 56:12)
instantly um this APC stuff hasn't (56:09 - 56:15)
really sold out that quickly but there (56:12 - 56:17)
was a another luxury brand that Pokemon (56:15 - 56:19)
worked with that was on Pokemon Center (56:17 - 56:20)
that sold out I can't remember they've (56:19 - 56:21)
they've worked with a lot of luxury (56:20 - 56:23)
Brands but that being said they've (56:21 - 56:24)
worked with a lot of smaller Brands too (56:23 - 56:26)
like they're II release sold out (56:24 - 56:29)
instantly their um whatever shoe that (56:26 - 56:31)
was Reebok or Adidas I don't remember (56:29 - 56:35)
that sold out instantly (56:31 - 56:38)
uh the skateboard stuff sold out in God (56:35 - 56:39)
I'm still mad about that skateboard (56:38 - 56:43)
skateboard stuff sold out instantly so (56:39 - 56:46)
they're it makes sense for Pokemon (56:43 - 56:47)
because they're hitting so many (56:46 - 56:50)
different (56:47 - 56:50)
markets um but yeah I can see why people (56:50 - 56:55)
would be like this sucks why is this (56:53 - 56:57)
t-shirt (56:55 - 56:57)
$160 yeah I mean I saw their original (56:57 - 57:01)
post when they said we're going to be (57:00 - 57:03)
collaborating with this company and I (57:01 - 57:05)
went and said oh that's cool more (57:03 - 57:06)
Pokemon clothes and I clicked on the (57:05 - 57:09)
company and I saw that it was $300 $400 (57:06 - 57:14)
sweatshirts and I went oh that kind of (57:09 - 57:14)
company Hello Kitty does this a lot too (57:16 - 57:21)
for those that like Hello Kitty partners (57:18 - 57:26)
with both luxury Brands and um (57:21 - 57:29)
non-luxury Brands again I w't make (57:26 - 57:30)
anyone feel poor I feel poor talking (57:29 - 57:31)
about (57:30 - 57:33)
this Hello Kitty partner with like a (57:31 - 57:36)
wine company oh hell K hell kitty was (57:33 - 57:40)
just like yeah do it let's fire it up (57:36 - 57:42)
1,000% let's get you (57:40 - 57:45)
going let's hell's up there with Pokemon (57:42 - 57:47)
as like top grossing merchandise it's (57:45 - 57:50)
crazy I I'm gonna say that like the (57:47 - 57:53)
prices on APC are (57:50 - 57:57)
not they are not not outrageously (57:53 - 57:59)
expensive they (57:57 - 58:03)
are in the mid-range of any sort of (57:59 - 58:07)
brand that does clothing like you will (58:03 - 58:11)
find Calvin Klein shirts Hugo BOS shirts (58:07 - 58:13)
all the things that are the same price (58:11 - 58:17)
these are standard ready to (58:13 - 58:21)
wear prices for Brands who make that (58:17 - 58:26)
level of whatever you want like (58:21 - 58:27)
mind-blowingly expensive but they are (58:26 - 58:30)
still expensive they are expensive but (58:27 - 58:32)
again they are in line with a lot of (58:30 - 58:35)
other brands the question always comes (58:32 - 58:36)
down (58:35 - 58:39)
to how much are you paying for the (58:36 - 58:41)
logo because you won't know until you (58:39 - 58:43)
feel the quality like did you pay for (58:41 - 58:47)
Quality were you just paying for a logo (58:43 - 58:48)
um you know there's a lot there's a lot (58:47 - 58:50)
of arguments I can make about Calvin (58:48 - 58:52)
Klein you are just paying for the logo (58:50 - 58:56)
because their quality is not great (58:52 - 59:01)
um but again it is it in line with a (58:56 - 59:03)
brand that is ready to wear I think (59:01 - 59:05)
where it (59:03 - 59:07)
comes more for like Pokemon fans who are (59:05 - 59:10)
used to buying things off (59:07 - 59:12)
of Pokemon Center where it's just a (59:10 - 59:14)
t-shirt that they made (59:12 - 59:17)
like the logo that you're paying for is (59:14 - 59:19)
the Pokemon that you're buying and the (59:17 - 59:21)
T-shirt quality will vary wildly (59:19 - 59:26)
depending but it is a very they aren't (59:21 - 59:28)
they aren't in the clothing business (59:26 - 59:30)
they are buying bulk t-shirts and (59:28 - 59:32)
putting their logo on (59:30 - 59:35)
it companies like APC companies like (59:32 - 59:38)
Calvin Klein they are designing (59:35 - 59:40)
Silhouettes they are designing things to (59:38 - 59:42)
look and people so you're paying for the (59:40 - 59:45)
silhouette they created the logo and (59:42 - 59:48)
hopefully a good quality item and those (59:45 - 59:52)
things add up um it is probably more (59:48 - 59:54)
than most people want to spend on (59:52 - 59:56)
something that seems slightly frivolous (59:54 - 60:00)
like a Pokemon shirt in the market of (59:56 - 60:03)
all of the other Pokemon shirts um but (60:00 - 60:05)
like I'm on APC sites I'm looking at (60:03 - 60:06)
their jackets there's a lot of gorgeous (60:05 - 60:08)
jackets I'm like yeah I would pay those (60:06 - 60:09)
jackets and they're about the price you (60:08 - 60:12)
would pay for a good jacket um that (60:09 - 60:16)
should potentially last a long time it (60:12 - 60:19)
it is just when you look (60:16 - 60:22)
at generally the stuff you see on (60:19 - 60:25)
Pokemon Center like they 100% acrylic (60:22 - 60:27)
sweaters that are way too expensive and (60:25 - 60:30)
also why are they acrylic um the prices (60:27 - 60:33)
are just like No And if you aren't used (60:30 - 60:35)
to (60:33 - 60:38)
spending money on clothing at that level (60:35 - 60:40)
these all (60:38 - 60:44)
seem out of control yeah right (60:40 - 60:47)
like I like I could buy a suit for as (60:44 - 60:51)
much as a T-shirt and pants cost but (60:47 - 60:53)
again I would only wear that suit once (60:51 - 60:54)
in a while so I'm investing in a suit (60:53 - 60:56)
that will last me for years because I (60:54 - 60:59)
just don't wear it whereas spending (60:56 - 61:01)
money on any sort of denim product that (60:59 - 61:04)
I will burn through in a year you know (61:01 - 61:08)
you have to do that cost analysis but it (61:04 - 61:10)
is (61:08 - 61:14)
like APC versus Tiffany is a vastly (61:10 - 61:16)
different like Tiffany is just saying (61:14 - 61:17)
you're not going to afford any of this (61:16 - 61:20)
and don't even try this is 100% a satus (61:17 - 61:24)
symbol thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh (61:20 - 61:25)
I I think (61:24 - 61:28)
think my personal struggle with luxury (61:25 - 61:32)
stuff is the the like am I actually (61:28 - 61:34)
paying for Quality here cuz I think a (61:32 - 61:37)
lot of people would pay extra if if they (61:34 - 61:40)
could be reassured the quality is there (61:37 - 61:43)
I'm not a huge like leather person at (61:40 - 61:45)
all um but there's like this leather guy (61:43 - 61:49)
on Tik Tok and he rips open like Coach (61:45 - 61:52)
bags and whatever other leather fan like (61:49 - 61:54)
I I don't know I don't follow luxury (61:52 - 61:55)
stuff that but he'll be be like this (61:54 - 61:58)
he'll he'll say like this is an $800 (61:55 - 62:00)
leather purse and he'll like rip it open (61:58 - 62:02)
and he'll be like okay because the Le (62:00 - 62:04)
the amount of leather he used here and (62:02 - 62:07)
the style of leather and the the the all (62:04 - 62:10)
the costs like this bag cost $200 to (62:07 - 62:12)
make they're selling it for $800 based (62:10 - 62:14)
on how long it would take to make this I (62:12 - 62:16)
think that this is a good price or he'll (62:14 - 62:18)
be like I don't think this is a good (62:16 - 62:21)
price yeah and it it's so interesting to (62:18 - 62:24)
be like wow you like like like I've (62:21 - 62:26)
watched him review a couple Coach bags (62:24 - 62:28)
and all the Coach bags were like 250 or (62:26 - 62:30)
300 and he's like this is great this is (62:28 - 62:32)
this is an amazing price for this and (62:30 - 62:33)
then I've watched him like rip open like (62:32 - 62:35)
an a thousand leather bag and he's like (62:33 - 62:37)
this isn't worth it and it's just like (62:35 - 62:40)
so interesting that you would think the (62:37 - 62:43)
,000 bag would be way better than the (62:40 - 62:45)
$200 Coach bag I don't have anything (62:43 - 62:47)
against coach for the record I think (62:45 - 62:49)
coach is (62:47 - 62:51)
fine that is that is always the tough (62:49 - 62:53)
question right like one of the things (62:51 - 62:55)
that made Levi's (62:53 - 62:57)
collaboration appealing is I know (62:55 - 63:00)
generally what Levi's quality is right (62:57 - 63:04)
so I know what I'm paying my money to (63:00 - 63:07)
get uh it's hard particularly with these (63:04 - 63:10)
brands that are mostly online to be like (63:07 - 63:12)
I'm going to invest this money and I (63:10 - 63:14)
don't I don't know if I'm getting (63:12 - 63:17)
quality in return um because there are (63:14 - 63:21)
so many luxury brands that are charging (63:17 - 63:26)
you for their logo (63:21 - 63:29)
and you know you you'll get the same (63:26 - 63:33)
quality off of you know the wish.com (63:29 - 63:36)
right like they just go to the same they (63:33 - 63:37)
just go to the same manufacturer (63:36 - 63:40)
overseas and buy bulk and take the logo (63:37 - 63:41)
off and sell it for five bucks because (63:40 - 63:43)
that there's also nothing stopping a (63:41 - 63:45)
company from just saying their luxury (63:43 - 63:48)
and jacking up the price oh correct I (63:45 - 63:49)
mean and that is always the thing I (63:48 - 63:52)
think that's always the problem with (63:49 - 63:56)
luxury brands in general um and the fact (63:52 - 63:58)
with the decline of retail and (63:56 - 64:00)
department stores you just cannot go in (63:58 - 64:04)
and look and see (64:00 - 64:07)
also you never know what measurements (64:04 - 64:10)
they're using to determine their fit (64:07 - 64:15)
they lie a lot vanity sizing is a huge (64:10 - 64:18)
thing in the industry it is not just for (64:15 - 64:20)
women anymore it is men's clothing and (64:18 - 64:22)
everywhere in between vanity sizing is a (64:20 - 64:24)
thing so one of the sad things about the (64:22 - 64:26)
decline of retail is there just aren't (64:24 - 64:28)
places to go try things on anymore and (64:26 - 64:30)
they're getting much more regressive (64:28 - 64:32)
with their return policies so when you (64:30 - 64:35)
see things like this it is a leap (64:32 - 64:39)
of faith that they are making something (64:35 - 64:40)
worth the amount of money that they're (64:39 - 64:42)
charging you (64:40 - 64:42)
for the ti thing's not worth (64:45 - 64:53)
it diamonds are falsely inflated so is (64:47 - 64:56)
gold (64:53 - 64:58)
the Pok Ball's real (64:56 - 65:00)
cool oh what did you say the Pok Ball's (64:58 - 65:04)
real cool though oh that's cool I want (65:00 - 65:08)
that uh speaking of pokeballs uh this is (65:04 - 65:10)
more of like a PSA not really like a (65:08 - 65:13)
news thing uh Niantic says that updates (65:10 - 65:17)
to Trainer Club login so if you are one (65:13 - 65:20)
of those people listening and you have a (65:17 - 65:22)
Pokemon trainer Club this was posted on (65:20 - 65:25)
November 14th nothing has happened (65:22 - 65:28)
yet uh but uh you're going to get logged (65:25 - 65:30)
out is what is going to happen I I I (65:28 - 65:32)
don't know if this is (65:30 - 65:34)
like because they didn't say I don't (65:32 - 65:36)
know if this is like routine maintenance (65:34 - 65:37)
or if they're actually making some (65:36 - 65:39)
changes or Pokemon trainer Club is (65:37 - 65:42)
making changes to whatever they need to (65:39 - 65:43)
do but (65:42 - 65:46)
ultimately (65:43 - 65:48)
um if you log in with Pokemon trainer (65:46 - 65:52)
club uh you're going to get a notice of (65:48 - 65:55)
update login screen if you're currently (65:52 - 65:58)
logged in you will be loged you may be (65:55 - 66:00)
logged out and you will need to validate (65:58 - 66:02)
to regain (66:00 - 66:04)
access uh Niantic is saying ahead of (66:02 - 66:07)
time we recommend that you note Trainer (66:04 - 66:09)
Club username and password keep that in (66:07 - 66:12)
mind because it might be different than (66:09 - 66:14)
your one and go once this change is (66:12 - 66:16)
complete trainers who have Trainer Club (66:14 - 66:18)
account will be able to receive a reward (66:16 - 66:21)
for validating your account more details (66:18 - 66:23)
on this item bonus will be available (66:21 - 66:24)
soon I don't again I don't know what (66:23 - 66:26)
that means uh like are we getting like (66:24 - 66:29)
what what one lucky (66:26 - 66:31)
egg also if you have additional login (66:29 - 66:33)
methods attached to your Pokemon go (66:31 - 66:35)
account we recommend you doing that (66:33 - 66:36)
anyways the reason I wanted to bring (66:35 - 66:39)
this up is because you should have two (66:36 - 66:42)
ways to log in to Pokemon go please if (66:39 - 66:43)
you if you're listening and you only (66:42 - 66:45)
have one way and that's only Google or (66:43 - 66:48)
that's only Pokemon trainer Club you can (66:45 - 66:51)
authenticate like four ways of logging (66:48 - 66:54)
in this is so important because if (66:51 - 66:56)
whatever your Google account was also (66:54 - 66:59)
your like old University email and you (66:56 - 67:02)
no longer go to that University and for (66:59 - 67:03)
some reason they retire your email after (67:02 - 67:05)
two years and now you don't have access (67:03 - 67:08)
to it you also then don't have access to (67:05 - 67:10)
your Pokemon (67:08 - 67:13)
go which is like a real scenario that (67:10 - 67:14)
has happened to many people where (67:13 - 67:15)
they're like I don't have access to that (67:14 - 67:18)
email anymore so what you can do is you (67:15 - 67:22)
can do like you can do Google you can do (67:18 - 67:24)
Pokemon trainer Club you can do apple so (67:22 - 67:27)
if you you're if you're on an iPhone you (67:24 - 67:29)
have an iCloud there's no reason why you (67:27 - 67:33)
shouldn't you wouldn't have an iCloud so (67:29 - 67:35)
link your Apple ID to that that's (67:33 - 67:36)
probably your safest email anyways (67:35 - 67:38)
because it's an iCloud email and it (67:36 - 67:39)
stores your pictures link that to (67:38 - 67:42)
Pokemon go it's fine um and I think the (67:39 - 67:45)
last one is Facebook which maybe you (67:42 - 67:47)
know do what you want with your Facebook (67:45 - 67:51)
uh but Facebook login is wildly accepted (67:47 - 67:54)
by like everyone over the age of 45 so (67:51 - 67:57)
there you go um but at least have more (67:54 - 68:00)
than one (67:57 - 68:03)
like like you don't want to be in Osaka (68:00 - 68:06)
and then get logged out and then be like (68:03 - 68:08)
I can't remember my password to my only (68:06 - 68:11)
login if you just linked your Apple ID (68:08 - 68:13)
you could have logged back in like it (68:11 - 68:15)
doesn't delete anything it just it just (68:13 - 68:18)
saves your data to multiple (68:15 - 68:20)
logins (68:18 - 68:25)
so do that I don't know you should it's (68:20 - 68:26)
important to do that both in Pokemon go (68:25 - 68:28)
and in Pokemon sleep if you don't have (68:26 - 68:30)
more than one way to log in make sure (68:28 - 68:31)
you have more than one way to log in if (68:30 - 68:32)
at all (68:31 - 68:35)
possible otherwise it's very easy to get (68:32 - 68:38)
stuck when something (68:35 - 68:38)
breaks yeah I think if you were to (68:38 - 68:45)
transfer devices in I don't even think (68:41 - 68:48)
sleep makes you have a login you have to (68:45 - 68:49)
go into that (68:48 - 68:52)
yourself so like when you you could play (68:49 - 68:53)
sleep without ever attaching it to an (68:52 - 68:55)
email but if you were to switch phones (68:53 - 68:58)
it will ask you what email so you need (68:55 - 69:00)
to go back to the original phone link it (68:58 - 69:03)
to something then go to the new phone (69:00 - 69:05)
and then log in it's like really weird (69:03 - 69:07)
if you broke or sold your phone then uh (69:05 - 69:09)
you're going to have to restart yeah (69:07 - 69:11)
yeah that's like if you have Pokemon (69:09 - 69:12)
sleep and you haven't linked it to (69:11 - 69:16)
anything and you drop your phone in the (69:12 - 69:18)
ocean your sleep stuff is gone cuz it's (69:16 - 69:21)
not linked to anything so I two things (69:18 - 69:23)
what pull over in your car right now (69:21 - 69:25)
link link your Pokemon sleep to (69:23 - 69:27)
something and then link your Pokemon go (69:25 - 69:32)
to another thing so you don't lose your (69:27 - 69:34)
stuff if I lost seven years of Pokemon (69:32 - 69:36)
go I would I would delete the app I (69:34 - 69:38)
would never play again I could not (69:36 - 69:40)
imagine starting over this is why I only (69:38 - 69:43)
have one login because at some point (69:40 - 69:44)
it's going to force me to do the thing (69:43 - 69:48)
that I should waiting for this to (69:44 - 69:51)
happen that's how I stopped playing (69:48 - 69:54)
games the Lin's gone well (69:51 - 69:59)
bad never again I guess I'm out okay (69:54 - 70:00)
well if you're looking to quit Pokémon (69:59 - 70:03)
go don't link it to anything then (70:00 - 70:05)
because you'll eventually be logged out (70:03 - 70:07)
you'll lose it (70:05 - 70:07)
all uh I put a whole uh we did a whole (70:08 - 70:13)
podcast about this I put a whole YouTube (70:11 - 70:18)
video up the podcast is for uh premium (70:13 - 70:21)
members so if you support on patreon or (70:18 - 70:23)
appc brand the are yeah if you would (70:21 - 70:26)
like to listen to our luxury podcast for (70:23 - 70:30)
$5 a month you can hear uh Greg Hannah (70:26 - 70:32)
and I talk about the DLC uh for about an (70:30 - 70:36)
hour um that's that's up there uh if (70:32 - 70:37)
you're on Apple podcast you can do a (70:36 - 70:39)
two- free week trial and you can listen (70:37 - 70:40)
to literally all the bonus episodes for (70:39 - 70:43)
free and then cancel if you want to um (70:40 - 70:45)
or you can keep it because you get ad (70:43 - 70:48)
free episodes as well um we're also now (70:45 - 70:50)
on like the Spotify Premium thing as (70:48 - 70:54)
well so if you if you I just just made (70:50 - 70:56)
that change this last week so if you are (70:54 - 71:00)
listening on the old premium RSS the old (70:56 - 71:03)
luxury RSS feed excuse me uh you will (71:00 - 71:05)
have to uh just go into patreon and just (71:03 - 71:07)
copy the new one and just put it in (71:05 - 71:08)
whatever podcast app you want the (71:07 - 71:10)
problem with this was like Spotify (71:08 - 71:13)
didn't allow this stuff for a long time (71:10 - 71:15)
because Spotify was trying to monopolize (71:13 - 71:18)
the podcast market and they they only (71:15 - 71:19)
wanted their own podcast and their own (71:18 - 71:22)
pod they have now opened it up (71:19 - 71:25)
to this so I made that switch because I (71:22 - 71:26)
do know people listen on (71:25 - 71:29)
Spotify but (71:26 - 71:31)
um if you can't afford that if you can't (71:29 - 71:34)
afford our luxury brand understand we (71:31 - 71:36)
have uh the free P the YouTube version (71:34 - 71:39)
out the YouTube version is different um (71:36 - 71:41)
it was people asking questions and me (71:39 - 71:43)
answering so uh the short of it is like (71:41 - 71:46)
Nintendo flew me out to New York I (71:43 - 71:49)
played the DLC for like an hour (71:46 - 71:52)
um there's really no spoilers I batt an (71:49 - 71:54)
Elite 4 member I can't tell you what (71:52 - 71:56)
Pokemon or what type she had I walked (71:54 - 71:57)
around the (71:56 - 72:00)
Overworld they new Pokemon I can't I I (71:57 - 72:03)
don't remember which ones I saw I (72:00 - 72:06)
exeggutor nine Tales they're they're (72:03 - 72:09)
walking around um but it seems good I (72:06 - 72:11)
think the biggest question was is the (72:09 - 72:13)
frame rate better the answer is no it's (72:11 - 72:17)
not it's exactly the same uh I don't (72:13 - 72:23)
want I felt so burned a year ago when (72:17 - 72:25)
they when they didn't fly me out I paid (72:23 - 72:30)
my own way that time uh to play scarlet (72:25 - 72:33)
and violet early and I sat on the show (72:30 - 72:36)
and I told you guys it ran great it (72:33 - 72:39)
looked great there was a cloth and then (72:36 - 72:41)
it came out and it (72:39 - 72:44)
runs bad (72:41 - 72:48)
yep and I felt like Nintendo gas lit me (72:44 - 72:51)
into thinking this game was amazing and (72:48 - 72:54)
I talked to a bunch of other people that (72:51 - 72:57)
went to the same showing and I was like (72:54 - 72:59)
hey (72:57 - 73:04)
man did am i al hallucinating did it (72:59 - 73:08)
did what are these bubbles uh what is (73:04 - 73:11)
going on over there where do these (73:08 - 73:14)
bubbles come from what are you (73:11 - 73:14)
doing what is that was it you (73:18 - 73:24)
Hannah I don't think so (73:22 - 73:28)
[Laughter] (73:24 - 73:31)
I'm sorry audio (73:28 - 73:31)
listeners is (73:31 - 73:37)
Happ anyways everyone I talked to that (73:33 - 73:39)
also played scarlet and violet before it (73:37 - 73:42)
came out was like it ran great for us (73:39 - 73:46)
too and we're so confused why it ran (73:42 - 73:49)
badly and I already saw that some people (73:46 - 73:51)
who previewed it early was like yeah it (73:49 - 73:54)
feels like the frame rate is better (73:51 - 73:57)
I don't think so no no and I don't I (73:54 - 74:00)
don't I don't even want to say like oh (73:57 - 74:02)
it runs 2% better because I don't think (74:00 - 74:05)
it does number one number two is I don't (74:02 - 74:07)
want people to feel like okay I'm gonna (74:05 - 74:09)
buy it because Steve said it feels a (74:07 - 74:11)
little bit better I don't think it does (74:09 - 74:13)
what I did realize though in like the (74:11 - 74:14)
last two (74:13 - 74:17)
weeks is the frame rate actually does (74:14 - 74:20)
run better when you're zoomed super (74:17 - 74:23)
close in and when you're zoomed out it (74:20 - 74:25)
runs terrible and I actually recorded (74:23 - 74:27)
footage of this in real time of it like (74:25 - 74:29)
me just zooming in in the same area and (74:27 - 74:31)
it running smoother and me zooming out (74:29 - 74:33)
and it like feeling like I'm underwater (74:31 - 74:36)
and if you watch like speedrunners (74:33 - 74:38)
play (74:36 - 74:41)
um scarlet and violet which I think most (74:38 - 74:42)
of them given up on playing scarlet and (74:41 - 74:44)
violet speedrunning they always play (74:42 - 74:48)
zoomed in because your character moves (74:44 - 74:50)
quicker so you know when when the teal (74:48 - 74:53)
mask came out and people were like the I (74:50 - 74:55)
said this earlier where you get like one (74:53 - 74:57)
tweet that's like it runs great then the (74:55 - 75:00)
next tweet is it runs (74:57 - 75:00)
terrible I really do think it has to do (75:00 - 75:06)
with how those people are playing like (75:04 - 75:07)
are you playing in handheld are you (75:06 - 75:10)
playing in desktop are you zoomed in are (75:07 - 75:15)
you not zoomed in um and so I don't (75:10 - 75:18)
think it runs any better uh it is it is (75:15 - 75:21)
more Pokemon it is double battled (75:18 - 75:24)
Focus uh the the the area does seem (75:21 - 75:28)
slightly bigger than the teal (75:24 - 75:32)
mask but what they showed us was such a (75:28 - 75:35)
small portion of what that DLC is (75:32 - 75:38)
supposed to be (75:35 - 75:41)
so but again I don't know if there's (75:38 - 75:44)
like anything hiding to convince you if (75:41 - 75:46)
you're already on the (75:44 - 75:48)
fence if you all if you already like (75:46 - 75:51)
double battles or you want more battles (75:48 - 75:55)
you're sold then that's what this is (75:51 - 75:57)
if you're looking for a new shiny (75:55 - 75:59)
hunting method no clue if you're looking (75:57 - 76:03)
for like a way to catch Legendary (75:59 - 76:06)
Pokemon no clue are legendary Pokemon (76:03 - 76:10)
returning in my heart I say yes but they (76:06 - 76:12)
didn't they didn't they didn't show that (76:10 - 76:17)
I'm sure there is some tweet SL forchan (76:12 - 76:18)
post (76:17 - 76:20)
slash you won't believe what's coming in (76:18 - 76:22)
the DLC YouTube video of somebody (76:20 - 76:25)
referencing those tweets I haven't (76:22 - 76:27)
looked at any of that stuff some (76:25 - 76:30)
sometimes it's right sometimes it's (76:27 - 76:32)
not I'll just (76:30 - 76:35)
wait I like I already bought the DLC (76:32 - 76:37)
like most of you all it's not like it's (76:35 - 76:39)
not like you can buy it (76:37 - 76:42)
separately you have to buy both at the (76:39 - 76:45)
same time so like I like to be surprised (76:42 - 76:47)
too um sometimes it's fun to look at (76:45 - 76:51)
stuff early but also sometimes it's it's (76:47 - 76:52)
fun to be surprised so I already (76:51 - 76:55)
purchased it I played it a little bit (76:52 - 76:57)
whatever Secrets they're hiding I'll (76:55 - 76:59)
I'll just (76:57 - 77:02)
wait it's (76:59 - 77:02)
fine it'll be okay um but if you want (77:03 - 77:09)
that that's on YouTube uh it's on (77:06 - 77:11)
podcast uh otherwise the final bit of (77:09 - 77:13)
thing is uh we're going to be doing a (77:11 - 77:15)
charity stream I try to do four charity (77:13 - 77:17)
streams a year one every season this (77:15 - 77:19)

going to be raising money for hope for (77:22 - 77:28)

and wanted support to a good cause I (77:53 - 77:57)
really like hope for the day they've (77:56 - 77:59)
been really good to us so I think any (77:57 - 78:02)
any charity that (77:59 - 78:06)
is for mental health I was going to say (78:02 - 78:07)
most Charities are pretty good but there (78:06 - 78:08)
are actually some really bad Charities (78:07 - 78:11)
out there this charity is (78:08 - 78:13)
good there are some unfortunately there (78:11 - 78:15)
are some not so good Charities out there (78:13 - 78:17)
but this is a good one uh so if you want (78:15 - 78:20)
your money going to a good place uh and (78:17 - 78:22)
you in the holiday spirit feel free to (78:20 - 78:24)

sorry that's not our show if you clicked (78:46 - 78:51)
off you're missing the unite segment (78:48 - 78:54)
Greg it is your unite segment first of (78:51 - 78:56)
all I spent my holiday weekend getting (78:54 - 78:59)
back to master rank in unite (78:56 - 79:02)
two uh they have officially announced (78:59 - 79:04)
that moscara will join the frey on (79:02 - 79:06)
December (79:04 - 79:08)
7th uh they have also said that there's (79:06 - 79:11)
going to be a holiday themed battle mode (79:08 - 79:13)
and several holiday themed events coming (79:11 - 79:15)
soon there's no reason to think that (79:13 - 79:16)
these are different than the ones they (79:15 - 79:19)
did last year uh so if you liked them (79:16 - 79:20)
last year it's probably going to be the (79:19 - 79:21)
same because they have not made a big (79:20 - 79:27)
deal about it at all um there are we we (79:21 - 79:29)
there have two Pokemon have appeared on (79:27 - 79:30)
the public test (79:29 - 79:33)
servers um I won't talk about them (79:30 - 79:34)
because they haven't been officially (79:33 - 79:37)
announced but uh they are playable on (79:34 - 79:39)
the public test servers which suggest (79:37 - 79:43)
that they are in line to come out after (79:39 - 79:45)
this has there any been has there been a (79:43 - 79:46)
Pokemon on the test server that has not (79:45 - 79:50)
come out at this point no not that I can (79:46 - 79:53)
think of uh but the the tough thing (79:50 - 79:58)
about it is again public test servers (79:53 - 80:01)
are it's their testing ground so to talk (79:58 - 80:02)
about if that's the way they're going to (80:01 - 80:05)
actually be when they go live no like (80:02 - 80:07)
the numbers aren't right sometimes the (80:05 - 80:12)
moves aren't right uh how they evolve (80:07 - 80:15)
changes when they evolve changes so we (80:12 - 80:18)
don't what's on the public s server is (80:15 - 80:21)
just a test it is possible that they (80:18 - 80:26)
will pull one or both and say no these (80:21 - 80:28)
need to be really really reworked and (80:26 - 80:30)
things may slide in between there but we (80:28 - 80:33)
have an official date December 7th (80:30 - 80:35)
holiday stuff is coming back um that is (80:33 - 80:38)
probably going to be it for the year um (80:35 - 80:39)
every was talking about there should be (80:38 - 80:42)
a new map this year I don't think we're (80:39 - 80:44)
getting a new map this (80:42 - 80:47)
year H I don't I don't know we got like (80:44 - 80:49)
35 days I don't think we're getting a (80:47 - 80:53)
new map this year uh but uh (80:49 - 80:55)
I also think this is the last Pokemon (80:53 - 80:59)
being released this year uh so this is (80:55 - 81:02)
probably it for 20 (80:59 - 81:07)
