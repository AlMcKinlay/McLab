foreign (0:01 - 0:04)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:28)
539th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:25 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:28 - 0:34)
uh we have a last episode before Scarlet (0:30 - 0:37)
vial actually comes out to celebrate the (0:34 - 0:40)
occasion surprise Greg is here (0:37 - 0:43)
I'm here to bring your daily dose of (0:40 - 0:44)
negativity (0:43 - 0:46)
uh (0:44 - 0:49)
uh I am struck I am I already struggle (0:46 - 0:52)
with time as like a concept (0:49 - 0:53)
so (0:52 - 0:57)
okay because look as you get older time (0:53 - 1:00)
just really starts to not make a whole (0:57 - 1:01)
lot of sense (1:00 - 1:03)
and I was on (1:01 - 1:06)
Twitter and I'm like oh I'm really (1:03 - 1:07)
excited for these games they're coming (1:06 - 1:11)
out in like a month and then I saw they (1:07 - 1:13)
think it was like seven days away and (1:11 - 1:14)
I'm like (1:13 - 1:18)
what that's not what the heck day is it (1:14 - 1:21)
oh yeah it is just a week (1:18 - 1:23)
I'm still my head is like it's a month (1:21 - 1:25)
away it's a month away it's a month away (1:23 - 1:27)
it's not (1:25 - 1:29)
it's been a month away for six months (1:27 - 1:30)
it's been a month away for six months (1:29 - 1:33)
yeah Alice here (1:30 - 1:37)
yes and all Skittles Taste the same they (1:33 - 1:39)
don't I I agree with that on this this (1:37 - 1:41)
one this is real it's the only reason (1:39 - 1:43)
Alice here we had the skips I was like I (1:41 - 1:45)
need a Defender out of the skin and what (1:43 - 1:47)
makes me bad is the one study that (1:45 - 1:48)
they're like all Skittles Taste the same (1:47 - 1:50)
to these people they plugged their noses (1:48 - 1:52)
and made them taste I'm like yeah well (1:50 - 1:54)
all meat tastes the same as well if you (1:52 - 1:56)
plug your nose everything tastes the (1:54 - 1:58)
same when you plug your nose because we (1:56 - 2:00)
use both to taste (1:58 - 2:03)
you can't have okay we don't have enough (2:00 - 2:06)
time in this episode to debate Skittles (2:03 - 2:09)
oh because there's so much news Steve (2:06 - 2:12)
well the the there are big things (2:09 - 2:14)
happening in the world of Pokemon we we (2:12 - 2:17)
have three news items this week and I (2:14 - 2:19)
feel like they're gonna take a lot of (2:17 - 2:23)
time well two of the three (2:19 - 2:23)
okay I'll let the listeners decide which (2:23 - 2:28)
one didn't take enough time uh okay so (2:25 - 2:30)
here's the thing before we get into (2:28 - 2:31)
things because I know people are going (2:30 - 2:33)
to be really cautious and stuff going (2:31 - 2:35)
into (2:33 - 2:36)
um next week (2:35 - 2:39)
obviously we uh we report on official (2:36 - 2:43)
Pokemon news here uh when the games come (2:39 - 2:45)
out that's a little weird because it's (2:43 - 2:48)
an open world game so yep uh (2:45 - 2:50)
uh the episodes will still come out (2:48 - 2:53)
every Monday those episodes will not (2:50 - 2:57)
include story spoiler things they might (2:53 - 3:00)
include mechanics though like hey on (2:57 - 3:02)
next Monday we're probably going to talk (3:00 - 3:04)
about how breeding Works uh assuming (3:02 - 3:06)
that breeding is breeding's in the game (3:04 - 3:07)
but we already know that because they (3:06 - 3:08)
already said that you can get eggs from (3:07 - 3:11)
picnics so you're probably gonna be (3:08 - 3:12)
there are people right now seeing the (3:11 - 3:14)
show being like how do the eggs and (3:12 - 3:15)
picnics work we're probably gonna talk (3:14 - 3:18)
about that on Monday so I I don't know (3:15 - 3:20)
who is considering that a spoiler three (3:18 - 3:22)
to four days after the game came out (3:20 - 3:24)
because that's just the mechanic but (3:22 - 3:25)
that's something we're gonna be talking (3:24 - 3:28)
about the bonus episodes the mini series (3:25 - 3:30)
we're gonna do that is going to talk (3:28 - 3:32)
about the story and our experiences with (3:30 - 3:33)
the story (3:32 - 3:36)
um so at the start of those episodes (3:33 - 3:38)
uh we will say what we're talking about (3:36 - 3:42)
will be like hey we went to messagosa (3:38 - 3:43)
and we're talking about everything in (3:42 - 3:47)
macedosa uh that's an example I don't (3:43 - 3:48)
actually know if there's anything to (3:47 - 3:50)
talk about a message I would assume so (3:48 - 3:53)
since it's the biggest city uh in that (3:50 - 3:55)
region but there had better be a hot dog (3:53 - 3:57)
vendor there (3:55 - 3:59)
that's all I'm saying (3:57 - 4:01)
so yeah I know there was like this huge (3:59 - 4:03)
thing with the crown Tundra where uh (4:01 - 4:05)
glass tree or inspectrier were like new (4:03 - 4:09)
Pokemon and we I felt the I felt the (4:05 - 4:11)
right call to talk about them because I (4:09 - 4:13)
was very confident the Pokemon company (4:11 - 4:15)
was going to talk about them that week (4:13 - 4:17)
because of the sword and shield (4:15 - 4:20)
competitive format and it was like do we (4:17 - 4:22)
talk about Specter or glastly or do we (4:20 - 4:23)
wait a full week (4:22 - 4:25)
but I think they're talking about it (4:23 - 4:26)
this week and they did they did because (4:25 - 4:28)
they had to the competitive format (4:26 - 4:30)
changed that week so they they had to (4:28 - 4:31)
acknowledge that those Pokemon existed (4:30 - 4:33)
even though the crown Tundra just came (4:31 - 4:35)
out it was like well yeah but you're (4:33 - 4:37)
putting them into the next format of (4:35 - 4:39)
competitive so you have to say they're (4:37 - 4:41)
real (4:39 - 4:43)
um so just a heads up uh we'll try to be (4:41 - 4:45)
as as transparent as possible before we (4:43 - 4:47)
start talking about something like we're (4:45 - 4:49)
going to be talking about the uh anime (4:47 - 4:53)
stuff today uh and and if you don't know (4:49 - 4:57)
by now uh I suspend spoiler spoiler (4:53 - 5:00)
spoiler I see that spoiler 20 to 30 (4:57 - 5:03)
minutes uh before publishing episodes (5:00 - 5:06)
putting in timestamps so if you're ever (5:03 - 5:09)
like hey I want to skip the ash stuff (5:06 - 5:11)
and listen to what comes after the app (5:09 - 5:13)
stuff the time stamps are always in the (5:11 - 5:16)
show notes on literally every podcast uh (5:13 - 5:18)
app you're using to listen to (5:16 - 5:21)
okay I think the house cleaning is out (5:18 - 5:22)
of the way (5:21 - 5:24)
yeah (5:22 - 5:26)
housework is out of the way okay first (5:24 - 5:28)
bit of news here still bothers me that (5:26 - 5:30)
you say house cleaning (5:28 - 5:33)
what are we calling it it's housekeeping (5:30 - 5:36)
oh housekeeping it's housekeeping it's (5:33 - 5:37)
keeping house you're not cleaning (5:36 - 5:39)
anything we didn't clean anything we (5:37 - 5:43)
kept the house my mind is clean (5:39 - 5:43)

like you get the school outfit yeah in (7:10 - 7:15)

I would be impressive I would I would (7:18 - 7:22)
love it that would be really good I (7:20 - 7:24)
didn't really include any unite news uh (7:22 - 7:26)
this week just because we don't have (7:24 - 7:28)
time but like Dragon Ball and Hershey Fu (7:26 - 7:30)
and Kung Fae are apparently coming to (7:28 - 7:32)
unite there on the public they're on the (7:30 - 7:34)
public test server they're massively (7:32 - 7:37)
changing eventually but the big news is (7:34 - 7:40)
we are six days away from Sableye (7:37 - 7:42)
even less now was it was this coming out (7:40 - 7:44)
Monday we are four days away we're going (7:42 - 7:46)
to have time to play city boy with (7:44 - 7:48)
scarlet and violet no well that's what I (7:46 - 7:50)
said because the first week is pay only (7:48 - 7:53)
through gems and I thought if it had (7:50 - 7:55)
come out last week I was going to pay (7:53 - 7:56)
gems (7:55 - 7:58)
but as always comes out on Wednesday (7:56 - 8:00)
they're not getting my money because I'm (7:58 - 8:02)
not going to be able to play it for two (8:00 - 8:05)
weeks and then it'll be for coins (8:02 - 8:07)
at least we had Community today before (8:05 - 8:08)
the release so that that was an (8:07 - 8:11)
improvement oh my gosh yeah that was (8:08 - 8:14)
sword and shield release day was Friday (8:11 - 8:16)
and then Community was Saturday and I'm (8:14 - 8:18)
pretty sure it was Chimchar (8:16 - 8:20)
that's right (8:18 - 8:22)
and I remember literally running to the (8:20 - 8:25)
mall playing for just an hour just to (8:22 - 8:26)
get three and then like driving back (8:25 - 8:29)
home and then like starting stream yeah (8:26 - 8:31)
I was like I I get there's part of me (8:29 - 8:33)
that like I understand you want all your (8:31 - 8:35)
your player base to participate (8:33 - 8:37)
something Pokemon in a weekend but (8:35 - 8:39)
there's another part of me that's like (8:37 - 8:42)
there are overlapping your player base (8:39 - 8:44)
that wants to do everything and cannot (8:42 - 8:46)
because time exists (8:44 - 8:49)
well this is the thing because like most (8:46 - 8:51)
most franchises don't work like that (8:49 - 8:53)
when they have a bunch of things to (8:51 - 8:54)
spread them out so that then you you (8:53 - 8:56)
know it's like with with Disney with (8:54 - 8:57)
owning Star Wars and Marvel stuff (8:56 - 8:59)
they're trying not to overlap them so (8:57 - 9:00)
that there's always something you can (8:59 - 9:02)
watch this idea of like oh no everyone (9:00 - 9:04)
everything must happen at the same time (9:02 - 9:07)
it doesn't it it bizarre it is a (9:04 - 9:11)
uniquely Janine Pokemon experience she (9:07 - 9:13)
has got complete Commander over that (9:11 - 9:15)
calendar and she does not want to work (9:13 - 9:19)
more than one weekend a month that's it (9:15 - 9:22)
he's got an iron grip on how they (9:19 - 9:24)
schedule things (9:22 - 9:24)
uh they this press release wants to (9:25 - 9:29)
start off with the dawn fan stuff but I (9:27 - 9:32)
don't what just look get it out of the (9:29 - 9:34)
way let's start off with the terrorists (9:32 - 9:37)
the terror AIDS (9:34 - 9:38)
um oh yeah (9:37 - 9:40)
let's let's start off with that so so (9:38 - 9:41)
they're they're they they talk about two (9:40 - 9:44)
different Terror rate things first is uh (9:41 - 9:46)
first we'll we'll do the Eevee stuff (9:44 - 9:48)
special Terra Raid Battle event will (9:46 - 9:50)
increase your chance for encountering (9:48 - 9:54)
certain Pokemon or Terra types (9:50 - 9:57)
I (9:54 - 9:59)
I hate I I hate that I told you some (9:57 - 10:01)
people and I never want to be that I (9:59 - 10:02)
told you so people (10:01 - 10:04)
but the amount of people I've had to (10:02 - 10:06)
explain this to in my twitch chat has (10:04 - 10:09)
been so exhausting (10:06 - 10:12)
but I but I I I think I was right in (10:09 - 10:14)
what they're doing here and I'll explain (10:12 - 10:16)
one more time before these games come (10:14 - 10:17)
out and if I'm wrong that's cool you (10:16 - 10:19)
guys can come into my twitch and say (10:17 - 10:20)
look Steve you're wrong totally okay (10:19 - 10:22)
with that but I think it's pretty (10:20 - 10:25)
clear-cut what the what the next three (10:22 - 10:26)
years of this game is gonna look like (10:25 - 10:29)
assuming that the game is three years (10:26 - 10:31)
after the release of Pokemon scarlet and (10:29 - 10:33)
violet Terra Raid Battle events will (10:31 - 10:34)
allow players to take on specific (10:33 - 10:36)
Pokemon or encounter Pokemon with spec (10:34 - 10:39)
with certain Terror types more (10:36 - 10:41)
frequently the Tara raid crystals (10:39 - 10:43)
related to these vents may look ordinary (10:41 - 10:46)
at first class but are shrouded in a (10:43 - 10:47)
mystery aura (10:46 - 10:49)
the first of these tarot Raid Battle (10:47 - 10:52)
events will be the Eevee Spotlight held (10:49 - 10:55)
on November 24th to 27th so a week after (10:52 - 10:57)
the game comes Thanksgiving weekend (10:55 - 11:00)
during the event Evie with various (10:57 - 11:02)
Terror types will appear more frequently (11:00 - 11:06)
in Terror raid battles (11:02 - 11:06)
as well uh take on Black Terror raid (11:11 - 11:17)
battles during their Adventures players (11:15 - 11:19)
may find black crystals that look (11:17 - 11:20)
different than other ones that they (11:19 - 11:23)
would ignore uh ordinary approach uh (11:20 - 11:25)
ordinary approach to take on for tarot (11:23 - 11:26)
rates (11:25 - 11:28)
the Pokemon they'll face in these black (11:26 - 11:30)
tarot raid crystals are much stronger (11:28 - 11:32)
than those that appear in ordinary (11:30 - 11:33)
Terror raid battles and are only (11:32 - 11:35)
available for a limited time trainers (11:33 - 11:37)
who manage to successfully defeat these (11:35 - 11:38)
Pokemon kill get rewards even more (11:37 - 11:41)
exciting than usual Charizard with the (11:38 - 11:43)
mightiest Mark will appear in Black (11:41 - 11:46)
Terror crystal that's just a mouthful (11:43 - 11:49)
black Crystal tarot raid battles the the (11:46 - 11:52)
this the Dragon Knight Knight Mega Sable (11:49 - 11:56)
II this uh Charizard will appear be (11:52 - 11:58)
appearing two times the first is (11:56 - 12:00)
December 1st through 4th then again (11:58 - 12:02)
December 15th through 18th Charizard (12:00 - 12:05)
cannot normally be encountered in paldea (12:02 - 12:08)
and the Charizard appearing during this (12:05 - 12:10)
event is a dragon as its Terror type (12:08 - 12:13)
players will be able to take on terror (12:10 - 12:15)
raid battles at black crystals after (12:13 - 12:17)
completing certain post-game events (12:15 - 12:19)
however players who haven't completed (12:17 - 12:22)
the event uh (12:19 - 12:24)
may still participate in Terror raid (12:22 - 12:26)
battles by joining other players using (12:24 - 12:28)
the link code (12:26 - 12:28)
thing about the Charizard somebody has (12:30 - 12:33)
to beat the game to do the Charizard (12:32 - 12:35)
stuff this is no different than in sword (12:33 - 12:37)
and shield where if you wanted five star (12:35 - 12:40)
raids to appear you had to beat Leon but (12:37 - 12:42)
if somebody else beat Leon they could (12:40 - 12:45)
invite you to those raids it's the same (12:42 - 12:46)
thing you're retards are the the I guess (12:45 - 12:48)
the underlining thing here is we don't (12:46 - 12:52)
know what considers beating the game is (12:48 - 12:56)
is that defeating the champion is that (12:52 - 12:57)
in the game (12:56 - 13:00)
yeah it says certain post-game events so (12:57 - 13:02)
presumably once you have defeated (13:00 - 13:04)
whatever this versions of the champion (13:02 - 13:06)
is which you know there are theories (13:04 - 13:08)
about based on things that have happened (13:06 - 13:11)
um there will presumably be someone that (13:08 - 13:13)
explains this black Crystal to you and (13:11 - 13:15)
then you can use it like I don't think (13:13 - 13:17)
it's going to be a complicated thing (13:15 - 13:18)
it's not like here's a chain of five (13:17 - 13:20)
different things it's not only like (13:18 - 13:21)
getting (13:20 - 13:24)
um the the other the other dog in (13:21 - 13:25)
Sergeant Shield right that was a (13:24 - 13:27)
complicated nice fun little story it's (13:25 - 13:28)
not gonna be something complicated like (13:27 - 13:30)
that (13:28 - 13:31)
um but (13:30 - 13:34)
yeah uh I think my my issue with this is (13:31 - 13:36)
not I I think this is an interesting (13:34 - 13:39)
idea I think it's really cool and I (13:36 - 13:41)
think we can see the they've clearly (13:39 - 13:43)
been thinking about this because I think (13:41 - 13:45)
this is to replace things like the the (13:43 - 13:49)
Mewtwo event the um event (13:45 - 13:51)
um the was that a shiny one there was an (13:49 - 13:53)
artist event (13:51 - 13:54)
I think it was there was one you were (13:53 - 13:56)
battling that was shiny (13:54 - 13:59)
is there Aura the shiny one was harder (13:56 - 14:03)
yeah yeah so so I think it's I think (13:59 - 14:03)
it's (14:03 - 14:05)
to replace that so they didn't have they (14:03 - 14:07)
didn't allow you to catch them but I (14:05 - 14:08)
suspect that's because they didn't code (14:07 - 14:11)
in the ability to only catch one as this (14:08 - 14:15)
is this is telling us yes and so this I (14:11 - 14:17)
think we probably won't get events like (14:15 - 14:19)
that again and instead they'll be in (14:17 - 14:21)
this so you can fight them you can catch (14:19 - 14:23)
them once and then you can keep fighting (14:21 - 14:25)
them again I don't have an issue with (14:23 - 14:28)
that I think it's very quick and very (14:25 - 14:32)
short to have an event that requires at (14:28 - 14:34)
least some people to be post game (14:32 - 14:36)
and I know that you just need to find (14:34 - 14:39)
people but not everybody has friends who (14:36 - 14:41)
can play the game as well (14:39 - 14:44)
right not everybody has friends the end (14:41 - 14:46)
well not everybody has friends who come (14:44 - 14:48)
who play the game and play the game fast (14:46 - 14:51)
you know yeah okay so there are a couple (14:48 - 14:54)
things here one we're hoping it's better (14:51 - 14:55)
than why come we say this every (14:54 - 14:57)
generation of game like people are like (14:55 - 14:59)
Festival Plaza was the worst thing ever (14:57 - 15:00)
and I was like let me introduce you to (14:59 - 15:03)
ycon because white Cam was so worse than (15:00 - 15:06)
Festival Plaza uh but so so we don't (15:03 - 15:08)
know that we don't we don't know how (15:06 - 15:10)
well the we don't know if there's an (15:08 - 15:12)
easy to see other people who have beat (15:10 - 15:14)
the game randomly that you can just join (15:12 - 15:17)
because a lot of the concern a small (15:14 - 15:20)
spark of hope in my heart (15:17 - 15:24)
with a phrase by using a link code and (15:20 - 15:26)
my hope is (15:24 - 15:29)
is that it is somewhat similar to (15:26 - 15:31)
Dynamax Adventures (15:29 - 15:32)
where you can put the typical (15:31 - 15:34)
information and come in Nintendo told me (15:32 - 15:37)
it should be like Dynamics not like yeah (15:34 - 15:39)
that fixes a lot of the problems with (15:37 - 15:42)
wycom for me yeah (15:39 - 15:46)
it should be like well you know Nintendo (15:42 - 15:47)
has not been a hundred percent correct (15:46 - 15:49)
you know in past things they've (15:47 - 15:52)
misspoken before but the two reps I (15:49 - 15:54)
talked to when I asked that specific (15:52 - 15:55)
question did say it should be like (15:54 - 15:57)
Dynamax Adventure where you enter a link (15:55 - 15:59)
code you do not need to be on their (15:57 - 16:02)
friends list that's what they told me (15:59 - 16:03)
um (16:02 - 16:05)
a couple things here uh marks are (16:03 - 16:08)
returning incredible great fantastic uh (16:05 - 16:10)
I I think they're they're they're (16:08 - 16:12)
they're a fun addition they make Pokemon (16:10 - 16:14)
more unique I think there's there's (16:12 - 16:16)
always been this concept or this this (16:14 - 16:17)
thought process in Pokemon where like (16:16 - 16:20)
IVs and natures and all that makes a (16:17 - 16:22)
Pokemon unique it really doesn't because (16:20 - 16:25)
they're they're like Optimal things that (16:22 - 16:27)
you need to run (16:25 - 16:30)
um you know like cool my your Grim snarl (16:27 - 16:33)
is adamant mind Grim snarl is bold I get (16:30 - 16:35)
why you're running bold you're more (16:33 - 16:36)
defensive I'm running out of it because (16:35 - 16:38)
I need to be a little bit stronger but I (16:36 - 16:39)
don't feel like our Grim stars are (16:38 - 16:42)
really that unique uh I I do think that (16:39 - 16:45)
Marx were a brilliant addition to sword (16:42 - 16:47)
and shield (16:45 - 16:50)
um they give you a reason to (16:47 - 16:53)
collect if you like to collect they give (16:50 - 16:57)
you a reason to catch the same Pokemon (16:53 - 17:00)
and you know if if Greg wants 18 (16:57 - 17:01)
different roselias all with different (17:00 - 17:04)
marks that's like a new thing that he (17:01 - 17:05)
could do (17:04 - 17:07)
um if you're a shiny Hunter and you're (17:05 - 17:10)
like I want more shinies like a shiny (17:07 - 17:13)
with a mark is statistically more rare (17:10 - 17:15)
than a one in eight thousand shiny that (17:13 - 17:18)
existed in in past Pokemon games so they (17:15 - 17:20)
they do add a lot (17:18 - 17:23)
um they're (17:20 - 17:23)
as well can make even more combinations (17:25 - 17:30)
of things that are all uniquely good (17:27 - 17:33)
like it's not like we go as you say like (17:30 - 17:35)
there's there's ideal IVs there's ideal (17:33 - 17:38)
Natures maybe too if you're lucky (17:35 - 17:40)
um but there's there's probably no real (17:38 - 17:42)
ideal Terror type for many of these (17:40 - 17:44)
Pokemon as well because you can run (17:42 - 17:46)
different strategies (17:44 - 17:48)
and it's also a very very simple thing (17:46 - 17:50)
you can ignore if you don't care about (17:48 - 17:52)
Marx really easy thing to ignore yeah (17:50 - 17:56)
yep and I do so so we have we we already (17:52 - 17:58)
have (17:56 - 18:01)
the first Pokemon that's not in the (17:58 - 18:05)
region decks which is Charizard assuming (18:01 - 18:07)
that you can also actually know that (18:05 - 18:09)
it's not in the region decks well it (18:07 - 18:11)
says that I think they said it they said (18:09 - 18:14)
it's not normally available usually when (18:11 - 18:15)
it says it can't be found in the the (18:14 - 18:17)
game it obviously there's plenty of (18:15 - 18:19)
Pokemon in sword and shield that yeah (18:17 - 18:21)
okay have like that's what I'm assuming (18:19 - 18:23)
right like that's what they mean because (18:21 - 18:24)
like when you catch (18:23 - 18:29)
like Nile ego in the crown Tundra in (18:24 - 18:31)
Dynamax Adventures it doesn't have a (18:29 - 18:33)
pokedex entry (18:31 - 18:35)
right (18:33 - 18:37)
yeah yeah I'm just I I wasn't saying (18:35 - 18:38)
that it's not I'm just saying I don't (18:37 - 18:40)
know whether that like yeah I'm just (18:38 - 18:41)
assuming that Charizard doesn't have a (18:40 - 18:43)
pokedex entry right yeah okay fair (18:41 - 18:46)
enough yeah that's that's what it that's (18:43 - 18:48)
what that's what that wording means that (18:46 - 18:51)
like you'll catch the charger that that (18:48 - 18:53)
is what I assumed when I first read it (18:51 - 18:56)
as well yeah yeah (18:53 - 18:56)
and we assume that Blastoise and (18:56 - 19:01)
Venusaur are Future No nowhere in the (18:58 - 19:03)
game because why would they be there (19:01 - 19:05)
because it's just Charizard (19:03 - 19:07)
what they're actually trying what (19:05 - 19:08)
they're trying to hint here is you can't (19:07 - 19:11)
catch Charizard but you can get Wars art (19:08 - 19:13)
in the game (19:11 - 19:15)
The Wire is hard for him (19:13 - 19:18)
but Charizard and its cantonian form (19:15 - 19:21)
won't have a pokedex you can't normally (19:18 - 19:25)
find that in paldea I (19:21 - 19:28)
I I I I wonder if because they're like (19:25 - 19:31)
the first one is December 1st through (19:28 - 19:33)
fourth so that's two weeks (19:31 - 19:35)
I wonder what their statistics are of (19:33 - 19:38)
like 50 of our fan base beats the game (19:35 - 19:42)
in two weeks and then of that 50 40 (19:38 - 19:44)
disappear and move back to Fortnight (19:42 - 19:48)
like it does also feel (19:44 - 19:52)
weird that they're doing those all these (19:48 - 19:56)
three events before the big holiday that (19:52 - 19:58)
happens at the end of the year called (19:56 - 20:00)
Christmas when a lot of these people get (19:58 - 20:02)
these games (20:00 - 20:03)
well there's just there's no doubt (20:02 - 20:05)
there's going to be (20:03 - 20:07)
a Christmas event right but I just feel (20:05 - 20:09)
like (20:07 - 20:09)
are these the only two dates and also (20:10 - 20:15)
like the second date feels to me like (20:12 - 20:18)
shouldn't this be a post-christmas date (20:15 - 20:21)
and nuts or the reason of Christmas or (20:18 - 20:24)
the weekend of Christmas or or the other (20:21 - 20:26)
option is I'm just I'm I'm a little bit (20:24 - 20:29)
confused why they've done it in in such (20:26 - 20:31)
short events at all like if you're (20:29 - 20:34)
running it for four days and and then (20:31 - 20:35)
two weeks later you're running it for (20:34 - 20:38)
another four days and you're already (20:35 - 20:40)
restricting the number you can catch I'm (20:38 - 20:42)
not sure why they didn't just run it for (20:40 - 20:45)
the two weeks like that that to me would (20:42 - 20:48)
make a lot more sense because I think (20:45 - 20:49)
the advantage because this is the thing (20:48 - 20:51)
right if you look at all the previous (20:49 - 20:53)
events right this is this is to replace (20:51 - 20:56)
events of some kind right like it's (20:53 - 20:58)
probably not going to completely uh (20:56 - 21:01)
replace the you go into your GameStop (20:58 - 21:02)
shop and pick up a code right it's not (21:01 - 21:04)
going to replace that please um but I (21:02 - 21:06)
wouldn't be surprised if it if it didn't (21:04 - 21:08)
reduce them I feel like this is their (21:06 - 21:10)
way to be able to do less of that if (21:08 - 21:13)
they want to and those always run you (21:10 - 21:15)
know at least a couple of weeks normally (21:13 - 21:17)
a month a month and a half and it just (21:15 - 21:19)
seems weird that this is so short (21:17 - 21:22)
well it's very it's very clear (21:19 - 21:24)
that they listened to the show and we (21:22 - 21:26)
were like can you announce these raid (21:24 - 21:28)
battles (21:26 - 21:31)
that's true dates which is which is (21:28 - 21:33)
great uh all joking aside (21:31 - 21:37)
is is there something like we we haven't (21:33 - 21:39)
mentioned that this is a hundred percent (21:37 - 21:43)
marketing I know that that people (21:39 - 21:46)
hate the Charizard (21:43 - 21:50)
pandering but I'm sorry gorbus is not (21:46 - 21:53)
going to sell copies of your game (21:50 - 21:55)
Charizard is (21:53 - 21:59)
like if people were on the fence and and (21:55 - 22:04)
it is release weekend having Charizard (21:59 - 22:07)
be so early and being like this only (22:04 - 22:09)
catch wants very difficult Mighty (22:07 - 22:12)
Charizard is such an easy marketing (22:09 - 22:15)
tactic to convince those people to be (22:12 - 22:17)
like oh man everyone's been talking (22:15 - 22:19)
about it Charizard's coming up next week (22:17 - 22:22)
uh do I wait till Christmas no whatever (22:19 - 22:25)
I'll just get it now like and if if they (22:22 - 22:27)
push as many people to buy it (22:25 - 22:29)
before Christmas and then word of mouth (22:27 - 22:31)
is this is an incredible game guess what (22:29 - 22:33)
goes on people's Christmas lists because (22:31 - 22:35)
people keep talking about how great this (22:33 - 22:39)
game is so I I think that is really the (22:35 - 22:41)
marketing side of it whereas like (22:39 - 22:42)
they're not saying what's happening (22:41 - 22:45)
after Christmas because if Charizard is (22:42 - 22:47)
coming back after Christmas let's just (22:45 - 22:49)
say I have no clue (22:47 - 22:51)
um people would be like ah you know I'll (22:49 - 22:52)
just wait but they want they want people (22:51 - 22:56)
to go out and get it now yeah I think (22:52 - 22:57)
there's also another reason why they do (22:56 - 22:59)
it early and I think it's a very good (22:57 - 23:01)
reason in that as you say like most (22:59 - 23:03)
people who play these games do not spend (23:01 - 23:05)
weeks like you know the fact that I have (23:03 - 23:08)
scheduled my gaming for this year to (23:05 - 23:10)
mean that I am not having to play any (23:08 - 23:11)
other games for the rest of the year (23:10 - 23:14)
right that is a unique thing we are (23:11 - 23:16)
weird people right most people don't (23:14 - 23:18)
they pick it up they play it for a week (23:16 - 23:20)
and then they finish and the fact that (23:18 - 23:22)
this is launching you know two weeks (23:20 - 23:24)
after means that they're still going to (23:22 - 23:26)
be in that brain space so that it can (23:24 - 23:28)
get them hooked into the idea idea of (23:26 - 23:31)
these events very quickly because if (23:28 - 23:33)
they did it a month later (23:31 - 23:35)
we would still do it of course we would (23:33 - 23:38)
but normal normal we always use that (23:35 - 23:40)
phrase normal people they're not going (23:38 - 23:43)
to be doing that just say filthy casuals (23:40 - 23:45)
filthy casuals (23:43 - 23:48)
but doing it two weeks after means that (23:45 - 23:49)
they they are much more likely to look (23:48 - 23:51)
into that and maybe go oh yeah then (23:49 - 23:52)
maybe this is something I can do (23:51 - 23:54)
regularly (23:52 - 23:56)
it's interesting that they're kind of (23:54 - 23:58)
setting up an every two week schedule (23:56 - 24:00)
because it's like (23:58 - 24:02)
Evie (24:00 - 24:04)
Charizard (24:02 - 24:06)
Charizard (24:04 - 24:08)
then there's only one week between Evie (24:06 - 24:11)
and yeah yeah are they setting up us (24:08 - 24:13)
like are they trying to Prime for a (24:11 - 24:15)
schedule like expect these things to (24:13 - 24:17)
happen on a regular clip is it just a (24:15 - 24:20)
big push at the start which is (24:17 - 24:23)
setting up a situation in which if you (24:20 - 24:25)
don't keep it up people won't be in the (24:23 - 24:28)
habit right like yeah if you if you do (24:25 - 24:30)
it right at the beginning before a (24:28 - 24:33)
majority of people get the game (24:30 - 24:35)
um because you know let's face it a lot (24:33 - 24:37)
of people don't spend money (24:35 - 24:39)
pre-Christmas because they're saving up (24:37 - 24:42)
for Christmas (24:39 - 24:45)
um if you don't keep up this level of (24:42 - 24:48)
event (24:45 - 24:48)
what do you like it is also it's hard to (24:48 - 24:52)
say (24:51 - 24:55)
like a special rate event (24:52 - 24:59)
it how like I want to know how big of a (24:55 - 25:02)
push that actually is right like how (24:59 - 25:05)
many extra copies does that sell it's (25:02 - 25:07)
hard to divide that out from holiday (25:05 - 25:10)
sales because the minute Thanksgiving (25:07 - 25:14)
hits It's a Mad Dash to buy things (25:10 - 25:16)
so it feels like yeah it's it's an extra (25:14 - 25:18)
bonus for people who already have the (25:16 - 25:21)
game but I don't necessarily think like (25:18 - 25:24)
this is a big selling push in the (25:21 - 25:26)
busiest retail (25:24 - 25:28)
I don't I don't think Charizard is a (25:26 - 25:30)
selling push for I think Charizard is a (25:28 - 25:33)
selling push for (25:30 - 25:35)
people who like Charizard which is a big (25:33 - 25:38)
market right but I don't think it's I (25:35 - 25:39)
don't think it's a selling I don't think (25:38 - 25:42)
it's an overwhelming selling push during (25:39 - 25:46)
an incredibly big gift-giving (25:42 - 25:50)
holiday section right like (25:46 - 25:51)
this is (25:50 - 25:53)
people who are going to buy the game (25:51 - 25:55)
before Christmas or they are being told (25:53 - 25:57)
they wait because it's their Christmas (25:55 - 26:00)
gift right like I I don't know I would (25:57 - 26:02)
argue that catching because you can only (26:00 - 26:04)
catch one of these Charizards I don't (26:02 - 26:05)
know if we said that to be clear it's (26:04 - 26:08)
one Charizard per se file let's who (26:05 - 26:09)
knows if there's a way to manipulate (26:08 - 26:11)
that or whatever you can still do raids (26:09 - 26:14)
you can do as many as you want you can (26:11 - 26:17)
only catch one Charizard per game (26:14 - 26:18)
um so you know I already saw the (26:17 - 26:20)
question are these Charizard shiny (26:18 - 26:22)
that would be like how would you even (26:20 - 26:24)
can you see if it's shiny in it can you (26:22 - 26:26)
do it is shiny after it like if it's (26:24 - 26:28)
just one it seems like it probably won't (26:26 - 26:30)
be shiny oh they've done raid events (26:28 - 26:31)
where (26:30 - 26:32)
you know (26:31 - 26:35)
things were locked or or they've done (26:32 - 26:37)
rate events where they forgot the ones (26:35 - 26:39)
that were they met they've done ones (26:37 - 26:40)
where they meant to be locked and then (26:39 - 26:43)
didn't manage it correct correct I was (26:40 - 26:45)
gonna say that too yes so you might get (26:43 - 26:48)
one nearly but like let's let's look (26:45 - 26:49)
back at like brilliant Diamond shining (26:48 - 26:52)
Pearl you could only get mu and sorry (26:49 - 26:55)
not mu you can only get manaphy within (26:52 - 26:57)
the first two months of that game (26:55 - 27:00)
I would argue more I and I get that (26:57 - 27:03)
manaphy is a mythical Pokemon very hard (27:00 - 27:04)
to get (27:03 - 27:06)
you know with Charizard you can get a (27:04 - 27:07)
lot of games but I would argue that (27:06 - 27:09)
Charizard would push more copies than (27:07 - 27:12)
manaphy easy not even close even though (27:09 - 27:14)
manaphy is a mythical Pokemon like just (27:12 - 27:17)
people inherently just love and like (27:14 - 27:20)
Charizard and so it's like I can only (27:17 - 27:22)
get this one Charizard (27:20 - 27:26)
within the first month of the game (27:22 - 27:29)
um and it's in a very special raid it's (27:26 - 27:33)
Dragon Terror type uh it has a Mark it's (27:29 - 27:35)
well you know me and I say it has a mark (27:33 - 27:36)
because like I know what that means and (27:35 - 27:39)
I care about it and maybe other people (27:36 - 27:43)
don't but like they're good hey it only (27:39 - 27:44)
took them like three years to (27:43 - 27:46)
acknowledge marks or like I don't even (27:44 - 27:47)
think they brought it up at all in in (27:46 - 27:49)
sword and shield (27:47 - 27:51)
I don't think they ever did like hey (27:49 - 27:53)
marks are cool I don't I don't think (27:51 - 27:55)
they really I don't remember any (27:53 - 27:57)
specific marketing towards it but that (27:55 - 27:58)
doesn't mean it didn't happen I don't (27:57 - 28:00)
remember anything no (27:58 - 28:02)
um the hero here's the other thing too (28:00 - 28:05)
so this this kind of goes with the Eevee (28:02 - 28:05)
stuff (28:05 - 28:07)
and so there were there were two (28:05 - 28:09)
pushbacks on my initial theory of what (28:07 - 28:11)
was going to happen number one is they (28:09 - 28:14)
the Pokemon company slash Nintendo said (28:11 - 28:15)
all (28:14 - 28:19)
Pokemon will have all Terra types (28:15 - 28:21)
and that's a very vague sentence because (28:19 - 28:23)
we don't know how many Pokemon there are (28:21 - 28:25)
everything we like when you say all (28:23 - 28:27)
Pokemon are you also including (28:25 - 28:31)
legendaries like if if how am I supposed (28:27 - 28:34)
to get 18 karadons with 18 teratypes I (28:31 - 28:36)
get right like just using Corydon as (28:34 - 28:38)
example your statement of all Pokemon (28:36 - 28:39)
have all Terror types is inherently (28:38 - 28:42)
broken because karate like that's like (28:39 - 28:45)
saying all Pokemon can Dynamax no not (28:42 - 28:47)
all Pokemon can Dynamics zashian and (28:45 - 28:49)
zamasenta could not Dynamax your your (28:47 - 28:51)
statement is wrong (28:49 - 28:53)
yeah so I think of it more like if if (28:51 - 28:56)
you would say uh you know all all (28:53 - 28:59)
Pokemon can have all IV spreads right (28:56 - 29:02)
that is (28:59 - 29:07)
technically wrong true well technically (29:02 - 29:09)
yeah okay technically wrong all Pokemon (29:07 - 29:11)
can have any number in any IV slot then (29:09 - 29:13)
there you go that's technically true (29:11 - 29:16)
there are legendaries have a minimum of (29:13 - 29:19)
three 31 IVs but technically any of them (29:16 - 29:22)
can be any number if you ignore the (29:19 - 29:23)
other previous the other the other IVs (29:22 - 29:26)
but that doesn't mean that you have to (29:23 - 29:27)
have a way to be able to get all of them (29:26 - 29:30)
right so if if they say they can be all (29:27 - 29:32)
of any of them that doesn't mean that (29:30 - 29:36)
you have to be able to catch 18 Corydon (29:32 - 29:38)
corridon it just means that when you (29:36 - 29:39)
catch it it's going to be one of the 18. (29:38 - 29:43)
it's 18 14. no because when you catch (29:39 - 29:46)
maybe maybe in karate's instance and I (29:43 - 29:47)
think there's still confusion on how (29:46 - 29:50)
Terror type works if you walk around the (29:47 - 29:51)
wild area (29:50 - 29:53)
and you see a little chunk Le chunk can (29:51 - 29:56)
only be normal Terror type no matter how (29:53 - 29:58)
many you catch (29:56 - 30:00)
um or and if you see a Roselia I don't (29:58 - 30:02)
know if roselli is in the game now you (30:00 - 30:04)
bring it up to break my heart is what (30:02 - 30:06)
you're doing but Roselia it can is fire (30:04 - 30:10)
or sorry fire yeah right now it's on (30:06 - 30:13)
fire it's pure fire in my heart Rosalia (30:10 - 30:16)
is grass or poison so the ones you see (30:13 - 30:17)
no matter how many you catch in the wild (30:16 - 30:19)
fifty percent of them are grass 50 of (30:17 - 30:22)
them are poison that's how it works when (30:19 - 30:24)
you go into raids when you see the Super (30:22 - 30:27)
Saiyan ones in the wild those can be (30:24 - 30:29)
quote unquote any any we don't know how (30:27 - 30:32)
that works either right and I also feel (30:29 - 30:33)
like (30:32 - 30:37)
they're giving themselves a way of (30:33 - 30:40)
including an item later that allows you (30:37 - 30:42)
to change the terror attack oh I'm sure (30:40 - 30:46)
that's DLC right or I think Scarlet to (30:42 - 30:48)
Violet too I think the statement is (30:46 - 30:50)
worded in such a way (30:48 - 30:55)
that it includes that possibility in the (30:50 - 30:56)
future so (30:55 - 30:59)
they can have any Terror type that (30:56 - 31:01)
doesn't mean that you can get (30:59 - 31:03)
you can catch that in the wild or it (31:01 - 31:06)
will be immediately available what Greg (31:03 - 31:08)
just said is what I've been arguing for (31:06 - 31:11)
months yes they can be every Terror type (31:08 - 31:14)
but that doesn't mean that like I'm (31:11 - 31:16)
assuming 400 Pokemon I don't know I did (31:14 - 31:18)
not look at the leaks but I don't think (31:16 - 31:21)
if there are 400 Pokemon that all 18 (31:18 - 31:23)
will be available and we now we know (31:21 - 31:25)
this with Charizard they're saying (31:23 - 31:27)
Charizard is in the game (31:25 - 31:30)
he's only dragon there's as far as we (31:27 - 31:32)
know there's no way to get an electric (31:30 - 31:36)
Charizard there's only dragon Charizard (31:32 - 31:38)
so unless there's some weird thing with (31:36 - 31:41)
breeding where you put like on a I don't (31:38 - 31:43)
know what breeds with Charizard (31:41 - 31:45)
of Charizard an electrost and a (31:43 - 31:48)
Charizard in a daycare does that give us (31:45 - 31:49)
an electric Charizard like we don't know (31:48 - 31:51)
that we know how breeding works with (31:49 - 31:54)
Terror types but if you can only catch (31:51 - 31:57)
one Charizard and it can only be Dragon (31:54 - 32:00)
well there's no there and you go to the (31:57 - 32:01)
competitive ladder and you're playing (32:00 - 32:03)
and you see a Charizard (32:01 - 32:06)
there's no water chars are available (32:03 - 32:09)
only dry I just I don't think I don't (32:06 - 32:12)
think they've used the phrase without (32:09 - 32:15)
thinking about it yeah yeah yeah I I I (32:12 - 32:18)
I'm not saying that like (32:15 - 32:18)
I am just saying I I'm not the the (32:18 - 32:23)
phrase of like all Pokemon could be all (32:22 - 32:26)
tear types I I do believe that but with (32:23 - 32:29)
the caveat that all Pokemon could be all (32:26 - 32:31)
Terror types when game freak says they (32:29 - 32:34)
can like like Charizard cannot be water (32:31 - 32:36)
until (32:34 - 32:38)
two years down the line where a water (32:36 - 32:40)
Charizard event is available which I (32:38 - 32:44)
think leads to the Eevee stuff (32:40 - 32:45)
I don't think you're going to be able to (32:44 - 32:50)
go around paldea and find all 18 (32:45 - 32:51)
Terra Evies (32:50 - 32:54)
before this event starts (32:51 - 32:56)
I'm sure there will be raid dens that'll (32:54 - 33:00)
have fire water grass (32:56 - 33:03)
but if you want to bug Eevee (33:00 - 33:04)
I don't know if there's going to be a (33:03 - 33:07)
raid done that gives you a bug Eevee (33:04 - 33:09)
um so it well it's not it's not just (33:07 - 33:10)
raids though because that because like (33:09 - 33:12)
yeah I've heard I've heard you make this (33:10 - 33:14)
point I think that's fair saying that (33:12 - 33:16)
not all raids raid not all Pokemon will (33:14 - 33:18)
be available and all Terror types in (33:16 - 33:20)
raids all the time because that would be (33:18 - 33:23)
a ridiculously large pool right like not (33:20 - 33:24)
all Pokemon are going to be in raids (33:23 - 33:26)
full stop all the time (33:24 - 33:28)
um but I think I think you're forgetting (33:26 - 33:30)
or maybe you're not forgetting maybe (33:28 - 33:31)
you're just assuming something different (33:30 - 33:34)
like the what what are they called the (33:31 - 33:35)
this version of brilliant what are they (33:34 - 33:37)
called the the (33:35 - 33:39)
glowing Pokemon is there a name for them (33:37 - 33:40)
I don't know if they have a name for it (33:39 - 33:42)
the Super Saiyan ones though (33:40 - 33:44)
yeah the glowing ones (33:42 - 33:47)
they're called brilliant so brilliant (33:44 - 33:49)
was in sword and shield but brilliant (33:47 - 33:50)
just assumed that it's a different (33:49 - 33:53)
concept yeah (33:50 - 33:54)
I don't anyway whatever these ones are (33:53 - 33:56)
right the special Terror type ones (33:54 - 33:58)
outside of raids (33:56 - 33:59)
um (33:58 - 34:01)
I mean why are you assuming that they (33:59 - 34:03)
won't not all Pokemon will be available (34:01 - 34:04)
like that (34:03 - 34:07)
I am assuming that yes oh interesting (34:04 - 34:09)
okay (34:07 - 34:09)
I don't assume I don't assume I I assume (34:09 - 34:16)
that only based off my pure instance of (34:13 - 34:18)
walking into a Pokemon getting defeated (34:16 - 34:20)
by it running away and it's still (34:18 - 34:22)
sitting there (34:20 - 34:24)
sure but you can catch it right and that (34:22 - 34:25)
an unused Pokemon is going to spawn (34:24 - 34:27)
there like I'm not saying that you'll be (34:25 - 34:29)
able to get them all really quickly I (34:27 - 34:31)
think it would take a lot of work but I (34:29 - 34:35)
would be very surprised if uh obviously (34:31 - 34:37)
every Pokemon that spawns in the wild (34:35 - 34:39)
right that's a key important Point yes (34:37 - 34:42)
yes one in the game spawns on the Wild (34:39 - 34:44)
every Pokemon that spawns in the world I (34:42 - 34:46)
am assuming and I don't know I have (34:44 - 34:47)
looked at some of the leaks I apologize (34:46 - 34:49)
I did it before you asked me to be on (34:47 - 34:51)
this episode I've looked at the leaks (34:49 - 34:52)
too (34:51 - 34:56)
I have not I am sure I am pure of heart (34:52 - 34:59)
pure of mind pure of soul I have looked (34:56 - 35:01)
at the leaks but it but and and it has (34:59 - 35:03)
changed nothing in how I think this is (35:01 - 35:05)
working but I haven't looked at the (35:03 - 35:07)
piano it's definitely changed it's (35:05 - 35:09)
definitely changed something for me but (35:07 - 35:10)
um no I don't know about this we don't (35:09 - 35:12)
know information about this at all from (35:10 - 35:13)
the leaks (35:12 - 35:15)
um and that's whether (35:13 - 35:17)
what was my point (35:15 - 35:19)
with this I will say that most leakers (35:17 - 35:21)
only care about leaking Pokemon not (35:19 - 35:24)
necessarily mechanics right I I really (35:21 - 35:26)
hate because it really annoys me like if (35:24 - 35:27)
you're gonna if you're gonna date your (35:26 - 35:29)
mind the games data mine the stuff that (35:27 - 35:32)
I care about right (35:29 - 35:32)
leaks the Pokemon but there's only so (35:32 - 35:37)
many of them leak the important (35:35 - 35:40)
information right now I can change my (35:37 - 35:42)
shoes (35:40 - 35:42)
my completionist list for all these (35:46 - 35:50)
things I need to get this information no (35:48 - 35:53)
one's leaking it leave the sandwich next (35:50 - 35:56)
can I put salami on these where leak all (35:53 - 35:59)
of my meat and cheese choices (35:56 - 36:03)
yogurt on my sandwich I need to know if (35:59 - 36:08)
there is version specific meat (36:03 - 36:08)
in the old game (36:11 - 36:16)
um are we doing brown mustard or yellow (36:14 - 36:18)
mustard this is the information this is (36:16 - 36:20)
Europe you don't do yellow mustard in (36:18 - 36:22)
Europe they don't even know what that is (36:20 - 36:24)
that's not that's not true (36:22 - 36:26)
um (36:24 - 36:26)
nobody likes the fridge (36:29 - 36:34)
is the most common the most common (36:31 - 36:37)
mustard that is um for we you we got (36:34 - 36:40)
American mustard for hot dogs but the (36:37 - 36:42)
best part of it the most common uh (36:40 - 36:45)
company that makes American mustard is a (36:42 - 36:47)
company called French French's yeah well (36:45 - 36:49)
Francis is French's American mustard (36:47 - 36:50)
yeah which is just a ridiculous Center (36:49 - 36:53)
Francis is one of the big ones here okay (36:50 - 36:55)
so even even yeah (36:53 - 36:57)
that's the point getting back to the (36:55 - 37:01)
point is I I agree with Al in that I (36:57 - 37:05)
think the sparkly shiny brilliant ones (37:01 - 37:07)
that you can run into the wild have the (37:05 - 37:10)
potential of being any of the terror (37:07 - 37:11)
types oh see that's what I was going to (37:10 - 37:13)
push back like if if the Super Saiyan (37:11 - 37:15)
Jigglypuff they show in the trailer (37:13 - 37:18)
I don't think it's gonna be all 18. I (37:15 - 37:21)
think it has the possibility if it's in (37:18 - 37:22)
the wild (37:21 - 37:24)
yeah and that was my point was I don't (37:22 - 37:25)
we don't actually know that I don't know (37:24 - 37:27)
for example nobody's state of mind that (37:25 - 37:29)
information right but I I I'd be (37:27 - 37:30)
surprised if they weren't because if you (37:29 - 37:33)
think about it most of the raid events (37:30 - 37:34)
were about getting (37:33 - 37:37)
gigantomax Pokemon and getting shiny (37:34 - 37:38)
Pokemon (37:37 - 37:40)
all of those you could technically get (37:38 - 37:42)
at any point in the game it was just (37:40 - 37:43)
really hard to get (37:42 - 37:44)
are you okay so let's go to the (37:43 - 37:47)
Jigglypuff example that that begs the (37:44 - 37:49)
question of if if Jigglypuff can be (37:47 - 37:50)
super saiyan (37:49 - 37:53)
and who knows if the other five Pokemon (37:50 - 37:55)
on that route could also be super saiyan (37:53 - 37:56)
like that's that's which is another (37:55 - 37:58)
assumption yeah we have no clue if it's (37:56 - 38:00)
only Jigglypuff on that route so the (37:58 - 38:03)
other five or six Pokemon how how does (38:00 - 38:05)
that are we or is it a hundred divided (38:03 - 38:09)
by 18 is it is it you know 20 fairy (38:05 - 38:11)
twenty percent normal two percent dragon (38:09 - 38:13)
two percent like (38:11 - 38:15)
it doesn't change the fact that they (38:13 - 38:17)
would all be available if they're all (38:15 - 38:18)
true people they're all available yeah I (38:17 - 38:21)
mean I do I think that (38:18 - 38:24)
like it's it's normal (38:21 - 38:29)
two typings are like 50 of what you'll (38:24 - 38:32)
run into and then the rest are some (38:29 - 38:35)
percentage that like let's be real this (38:32 - 38:37)
is a company that still does Catching (38:35 - 38:39)
percentages for no good reason right (38:37 - 38:42)
like they make things unnecessarily (38:39 - 38:44)
complicated there's no reason to think (38:42 - 38:46)
they aren't going to make this (38:44 - 38:48)
unnecessarily complicated as well but (38:46 - 38:50)
there's no there's also no yeah exactly (38:48 - 38:52)
there's no reason why they can't say all (38:50 - 38:56)
the Jigglypuff in the wild can only be (38:52 - 38:58)
these six Terra types if you want the (38:56 - 39:01)
other 12 those are in raids they could (38:58 - 39:03)
sure they could I don't think they will (39:01 - 39:05)
I don't think they will either (39:03 - 39:08)
because I don't think (39:05 - 39:10)
that (39:08 - 39:13)
all the raids will have all the terror (39:10 - 39:15)
types either (39:13 - 39:17)
I think they're I think they will I (39:15 - 39:20)
think they will still (39:17 - 39:24)
limit it where if you want uh you know a (39:20 - 39:27)
dark type Eevee that can only be (39:24 - 39:30)
available this weekend and there was (39:27 - 39:31)
pushback of people being like they're (39:30 - 39:33)
not going to limit Terror types to raids (39:31 - 39:34)
because then what if you missed the (39:33 - 39:36)
raids well they're already doing that (39:34 - 39:38)
with Charizard like if you want (39:36 - 39:39)
Charizard you've got two weekends to get (39:38 - 39:42)
Charizard and if you miss it if you miss (39:39 - 39:44)
it you can you can you can trade for it (39:42 - 39:47)
yeah (39:44 - 39:47)
to do a raid that might be competitive (39:48 - 39:54)
competitively viable and be like well (39:51 - 39:56)
you missed it so good luck go trade for (39:54 - 39:58)
it yeah yeah I mean they have it's not I (39:56 - 40:00)
don't think we didn't do it I think they (39:58 - 40:02)
won't do it I think that there's a key (40:00 - 40:03)
difference there like I think that they (40:02 - 40:06)
absolutely could and I'm not saying they (40:03 - 40:07)
wouldn't do it in the future I'm saying (40:06 - 40:09)
I don't think that's the case for this (40:07 - 40:11)
game (40:09 - 40:11)
I think we kind of look at a lot of what (40:12 - 40:17)
they've how they did raids before and (40:14 - 40:19)
they like Al said they made certain (40:17 - 40:22)
things that are difficult to get through (40:19 - 40:26)
other means yeah easier like we look at (40:22 - 40:28)
the Charizard but they're making a (40:26 - 40:30)
Charizard and saying you can't you can't (40:28 - 40:33)
get this in the game like you can't find (40:30 - 40:35)
it in the wild and I think we can't draw (40:33 - 40:38)
a lot uh from that example (40:35 - 40:40)
to what what could happen to things that (40:38 - 40:43)
are in the game in the wild and are (40:40 - 40:45)
sparkly weird like I think that's a (40:43 - 40:47)
that's a tough that's a tough Cavern to (40:45 - 40:49)
guess across (40:47 - 40:53)
okay but here's here's every Pokemon (40:49 - 40:53)
okay one more example like let's let's (40:55 - 41:00)
say there's a volt orb (40:58 - 41:03)
and the Voltorb (41:00 - 41:06)
appears on a route but can never be (41:03 - 41:07)
super saiyan (41:06 - 41:10)
but then appears in a raid and the raids (41:07 - 41:13)
that let's say it appears in the upper (41:10 - 41:14)
left hand I'm just picking like let's (41:13 - 41:16)
just say upper left hand and those raids (41:14 - 41:21)
can only be uh ice rocking ground and (41:16 - 41:22)
voltorp can appear in that so we know (41:21 - 41:24)
that it can be in a nice one or a ground (41:22 - 41:26)
one or a rock one (41:24 - 41:28)
but it can't be super saiyan in the wild (41:26 - 41:31)
that is restricting what Terror types it (41:28 - 41:32)
could be (41:31 - 41:34)
yeah that's a lot of assumptions yeah (41:32 - 41:36)
that's assuming that they aren't like (41:34 - 41:39)
every Pokemon can't be super saiyan in (41:36 - 41:41)
the wild right that that's the I guess (41:39 - 41:43)
that's the question we have can every (41:41 - 41:45)
Pokemon in the wild be super saiyan and (41:43 - 41:48)
I mean so if we look at (41:45 - 41:53)
the games before this I do we know that (41:48 - 41:55)
Pokemon in the wild was there were any (41:53 - 41:57)
restricted that couldn't be brilliant (41:55 - 41:59)
that couldn't have the weird glow around (41:57 - 42:01)
them the static ones (41:59 - 42:03)
there were that's the thing there there (42:01 - 42:06)
was static ones in the wild area like (42:03 - 42:08)
that Snorlax that spawned on that bridge (42:06 - 42:10)
could never be brilliant I'm almost (42:08 - 42:13)
positive yeah (42:10 - 42:13)
I don't know I I've not looked yeah but (42:14 - 42:18)
could you not get could you not get (42:16 - 42:19)
Snorlax in another way was that the only (42:18 - 42:22)
Snorlax you could get in the game (42:19 - 42:24)
oh um (42:22 - 42:25)
because there was difference because (42:24 - 42:27)
there are ways to get Rosalia there's (42:25 - 42:29)
the static one that always appeared but (42:27 - 42:30)
there were other ways to get it as well (42:29 - 42:33)
so but that but that static resilia only (42:30 - 42:35)
appeared on whether well I guess (42:33 - 42:37)
technically it's not Superior weather (42:35 - 42:40)
well Snorlax is all weapons except for (42:37 - 42:43)
fog when it was fog it was Clefairy (42:40 - 42:45)
right but that means that was the only (42:43 - 42:47)
way Snorlax in the game (42:45 - 42:49)
so I mean there's a lot of I mean (42:47 - 42:52)
there's a lot of questions to me it (42:49 - 42:54)
seemed like the Pokemon I ran into (42:52 - 42:56)
that I still can't talk about because (42:54 - 42:57)
it's a new Pokemon (42:56 - 43:00)
um that was glowing (42:57 - 43:02)
it felt like a Snorlax (43:00 - 43:05)
it felt like that Pokemon was always the (43:02 - 43:08)
Snorlax on that route and or it was (43:05 - 43:10)
there because the weather was a certain (43:08 - 43:12)
way but right if it it's always there in (43:10 - 43:14)
that weather but if it's rainy it's this (43:12 - 43:16)
one and then but it's also hard it's (43:14 - 43:18)
also hard because they were giving you a (43:16 - 43:22)
specific build they were and now when I (43:18 - 43:24)
when I I saw the beginning of the game I (43:22 - 43:26)
will this is not a spoiler I promise saw (43:24 - 43:28)
the beginning of the game when I played (43:26 - 43:30)
it and then when I watched somebody on (43:28 - 43:32)
Twitch do the beginning I was like those (43:30 - 43:34)
Pokemon were not there when I played (43:32 - 43:38)
yeah you gave me a very like yeah so it (43:34 - 43:41)
like curated it (43:38 - 43:44)
this is kind of like (43:41 - 43:46)
we're in the weeds in it because (43:44 - 43:48)
you know at this point it's it's a fun (43:46 - 43:51)
to speculate uh because literally there (43:48 - 43:53)
are so many things that we are assuming (43:51 - 43:56)
that we we can draw parallels based off (43:53 - 43:59)
of past games right like we can look at (43:56 - 44:01)
what the wild area and the raids Den (43:59 - 44:05)
raid dens were before this and say (44:01 - 44:07)
they're gonna most likely because most (44:05 - 44:09)
companies do this build off of those (44:07 - 44:12)
ideas but they could be like (44:09 - 44:15)
you know what yeah we didn't like any of (44:12 - 44:16)
those idiots that people didn't like him (44:15 - 44:17)
either so we're going in New Direction (44:16 - 44:19)
like it's really hard to say I would say (44:17 - 44:21)
I would say (44:19 - 44:24)
it feels (44:21 - 44:26)
like the things you can catch in the (44:24 - 44:29)
wild as a sort of exciting hunt thing (44:26 - 44:32)
that anything that could be brilliant in (44:29 - 44:33)
the wild (44:32 - 44:36)
living static if there are static ones (44:33 - 44:38)
in the game I'm assuming they're going (44:36 - 44:41)
to be but again leaving those aside (44:38 - 44:43)
those have the potential to be any (44:41 - 44:46)
Terror type to have sort of an exciting (44:43 - 44:50)
extra collection Mark extra thing to be (44:46 - 44:53)
like hey I was I searched for 57 hours (44:50 - 44:57)
and I finally found a (44:53 - 44:59)
dragon (44:57 - 45:02)
grievard yeah (44:59 - 45:04)
right like that is a thing I can see (45:02 - 45:08)
them absolutely doing so (45:04 - 45:10)
I think I think the things we feel safe (45:08 - 45:12)
on is their wording is specific I do (45:10 - 45:13)
think there will be a way to change (45:12 - 45:16)
stereotypes in the future in a DLC (45:13 - 45:18)
because that is the pattern they've set (45:16 - 45:19)
up (45:18 - 45:20)
um I don't know we have much to go off (45:19 - 45:22)
of for anything else (45:20 - 45:24)
I think I think we're missing the (45:22 - 45:25)
important thing here (45:24 - 45:28)
and that's the the dragon hat looks (45:25 - 45:33)
great oh yeah I I I have seen one new (45:28 - 45:34)
hat that they were like you can't talk (45:33 - 45:37)
about new hats uh and I wish it was the (45:34 - 45:39)
dragon head is tight it's it's really (45:37 - 45:40)
good (45:39 - 45:42)
and second thing I want to point the (45:40 - 45:44)
question is (45:42 - 45:46)
have we seen any Pokemon with like (45:44 - 45:48)
things coming out their heads with a hat (45:46 - 45:50)
on yet like for example grievard will (45:48 - 45:53)
the Hat be above the candle or will it (45:50 - 45:55)
be on the head with the candle like (45:53 - 45:57)
inside the hat like glowing through that (45:55 - 46:00)
I don't think we've seen um I'm trying (45:57 - 46:02)
to look on the picture of Charizard (46:00 - 46:04)
where the ears and the horns are and (46:02 - 46:05)
they look (46:04 - 46:07)
like they're (46:05 - 46:08)
hidden (46:07 - 46:11)
it's really hard to say I mean the whole (46:08 - 46:13)
national decks happened because they (46:11 - 46:15)
didn't want to put a hat on Wailord so (46:13 - 46:16)
they're like well you know we're not (46:15 - 46:18)
gonna bring Wailord in the game we don't (46:16 - 46:21)
worry about the Hat (46:18 - 46:22)
um I actually don't know if they showed (46:21 - 46:25)
Wilmer or not I just think a big Wailord (46:22 - 46:27)
with a hat would be very funny (46:25 - 46:29)
did I say that Evie Evie is November (46:27 - 46:32)
24th through 27th (46:29 - 46:35)
um it it does show a grass fire water EV (46:32 - 46:38)
in the the the screenshots here but I I (46:35 - 46:42)
I we don't know if there will be a fairy (46:38 - 46:44)
or dragon or (46:42 - 46:46)
we don't I guess we don't know serious (46:44 - 46:50)
it's as various it's various (46:46 - 46:53)
um I don't know what that means (46:50 - 46:56)
I have yet to see any of the hats that I (46:53 - 46:58)
like but uh but the title of it says (46:56 - 47:01)
special Terra raid battles increase your (46:58 - 47:04)
chance of encountering certain Pokemon (47:01 - 47:07)
or Terra types (47:04 - 47:08)
obviously or just a little work there (47:07 - 47:12)
yeah or the r is working hard section (47:08 - 47:15)
the entire sentence and carrying a whole (47:12 - 47:17)
lot of wiggle room on its back (47:15 - 47:21)
we need we need a break to carry a (47:17 - 47:23)
little wiggle room for the show so we (47:21 - 47:24)
will be we will take a quick break we (47:23 - 47:26)
will come back uh we're gonna talk about (47:24 - 47:31)
uh the Pokemon home stuff Rotom stuff uh (47:26 - 47:34)
and then the uh the the dawn fan stuff (47:31 - 47:38)
so we will be right back and we are back (47:34 - 47:41)
uh okay so the other thing our break you (47:38 - 47:43)
can't you can't I'm sorry cut things off (47:41 - 47:46)
like that it's like torture (47:43 - 47:50)
40 minutes on Charizard raid battles (47:46 - 47:53)
yeah but you can't take a catchphrase (47:50 - 47:55)
and then just drop it in the middle it's (47:53 - 47:59)
like horrific (47:55 - 47:59)
uh okay we talked about get we talked (47:59 - 48:04)
about gimme ghoul they have give me gold (48:02 - 48:05)
in this press release but we talked (48:04 - 48:07)
about that yeah give me Google give me (48:05 - 48:10)
give me go yeah yeah uh Scarlet book and (48:07 - 48:12)
violet (48:10 - 48:14)
the Scarlet book appears in Pokemon (48:12 - 48:16)
Scarlet The Violet book of players in (48:14 - 48:18)
Pokemon Violet I'm just saying that just (48:16 - 48:19)
because you know there was a black and (48:18 - 48:22)
white situation where you bought black (48:19 - 48:25)
you got Reshiram true that black and (48:22 - 48:28)
white was the bait and switch generation (48:25 - 48:30)
and then if you went to switch games in (48:28 - 48:32)
black to white you you got you got (48:30 - 48:35)
double screws you got you got you got (48:32 - 48:37)
tricked all the way down (48:35 - 48:40)
yeah I did that yeah they really they (48:37 - 48:42)
really get you they got you twice on (48:40 - 48:43)
that (48:42 - 48:45)
um this Expedition is said to have (48:43 - 48:47)
traversed an Uncharted area of the (48:45 - 48:49)
paldea region whether or not the (48:47 - 48:51)
accounts depicted in the books are true (48:49 - 48:53)
it remains unclear photographs and (48:51 - 48:56)
sketches of unidentified creatures to (48:53 - 48:58)
fill both pages of the book and while (48:56 - 49:00)
there are sightings of similar creatures (48:58 - 49:03)
in recent years such reports are rare (49:00 - 49:04)
and specific details around their (49:03 - 49:08)
biology are still a mystery (49:04 - 49:10)
uh for scarlet they showed off a (49:08 - 49:12)
creature called the monster known as (49:10 - 49:14)
great Tusk the Scarlet book describes (49:12 - 49:17)
how Savage this monster uh The Savage (49:14 - 49:19)
monster attacked Expedition teams with (49:17 - 49:21)
large body and tusks uh mortally (49:19 - 49:24)
mortally wounding one of their explorers (49:21 - 49:26)
it is literally saying this monster has (49:24 - 49:29)
has murdered somebody they this recently (49:26 - 49:32)
Pokemon to all about how many people can (49:29 - 49:33)
we murder in her ads and people will (49:32 - 49:36)
still buy our games because they are (49:33 - 49:39)
killing people left and right the (49:36 - 49:41)
monster known as iron Treads it is said (49:39 - 49:43)
in the violent book this Monster Curves (49:41 - 49:46)
its body not the violent book (49:43 - 49:50)
violent violent book monster curls its (49:46 - 49:52)
body and rolls to attack it leaves a (49:50 - 49:56)
trail gorged into the ground as it has (49:52 - 49:59)
scorched the Earth (49:56 - 49:59)
um (49:59 - 50:02)
this feels a lot like Legends Arceus is (49:59 - 50:05)
All I'm gonna say (50:02 - 50:08)
oh like uh what are they called Nobles (50:05 - 50:10)
well not just the Nobles but they're (50:08 - 50:12)
they're oh it's a book that has like (50:10 - 50:14)
information about eggs (50:12 - 50:16)
discovering Pokemon and stuff it feels a (50:14 - 50:19)
lot like what you do yeah (50:16 - 50:19)
um (50:19 - 50:23)
okay so there's there's some speculation (50:20 - 50:25)
here of what this is of course there are (50:23 - 50:27)
some people who saw leaks uh so they (50:25 - 50:30)
they know more than that uh obviously if (50:27 - 50:31)
you're listening to the podcast we're (50:30 - 50:34)
gonna go the speculation route (50:31 - 50:36)
um look I had I I played scarlet and (50:34 - 50:39)
violet two weeks early and had to record (50:36 - 50:42)
two podcasts you know speculating what I (50:39 - 50:45)
did or did not know and I I was people (50:42 - 50:47)
were like wow you did a really good job (50:45 - 50:49)
at convincing us you didn't know (50:47 - 50:52)
um so I I never want to like you know (50:49 - 50:54)
you know people are avoiding spoilers (50:52 - 50:56)
and never want to just flat out say (50:54 - 50:57)
stuff I know the people who want that (50:56 - 51:00)
stuff they just looking my my first (50:57 - 51:02)
thing from the trailer and from this (51:00 - 51:05)
phrasing the (51:02 - 51:08)
Uncharted region is the big cloudy part (51:05 - 51:10)
in the middle right like they fly out of (51:08 - 51:12)
it in the trailer (51:10 - 51:15)
I feel like that is just saying we're (51:12 - 51:16)
not going to tell you what's in the (51:15 - 51:18)
middle until you play the game it's (51:16 - 51:21)
gonna stay in (51:18 - 51:23)
I think for mystery it says that the (51:21 - 51:25)
middle is an actual array you can (51:23 - 51:28)
explore not a giant hole in the region (51:25 - 51:30)
which I think right but I'd say what I (51:28 - 51:32)
thought maybe two months ago of like oh (51:30 - 51:34)
there's just a Giants this is a giant (51:32 - 51:36)
hole it's this is the donut hole region (51:34 - 51:39)
I mean it makes sense that like that's (51:36 - 51:42)
the Uncharted mystery to me like I I (51:39 - 51:44)
felt it was interesting that they showed (51:42 - 51:47)
you flying out of this deep clouded yeah (51:44 - 51:50)
I feel like like what this did painted a (51:47 - 51:52)
picture that there's like this deep like (51:50 - 51:55)
forests and caves in that Center well (51:52 - 51:58)
that you can't see because of the fog (51:55 - 52:00)
and clouds forest and caves in the past (51:58 - 52:01)
version (52:00 - 52:04)
high-tech computers and Munchlax with (52:01 - 52:06)
hot dog machines in the Violet future (52:04 - 52:09)
version it's two different ones they're (52:06 - 52:12)
displaced in Time (52:09 - 52:15)
Machine yes the great hot dog machine (52:12 - 52:16)
has come to life (52:15 - 52:18)
ah (52:16 - 52:21)
I want to say Obviously these Pokemon (52:18 - 52:24)
look like Dawn fan I I that the you know (52:21 - 52:27)
I wouldn't be surprised if Don fan was (52:24 - 52:29)
trending on Twitter that day I've never (52:27 - 52:32)
seen so many people excited for Don fan (52:29 - 52:35)
people yeah I have no idea why (52:32 - 52:37)
the ancient one looks like Don fan I'm (52:35 - 52:39)
not really sure the future one looks (52:37 - 52:42)
like Don fan it doesn't its sketch but (52:39 - 52:43)
in its actual model it doesn't look (52:42 - 52:45)
anything like Don fan other than it's (52:43 - 52:48)
got a vaguely similar color scheme well (52:45 - 52:51)
I mean this cat has a snout and it rolls (52:48 - 52:55)
now it's got the tasks (52:51 - 52:55)
face from Pixar (52:56 - 53:03)
what's that what's that Wally it has (52:59 - 53:06)
like a weird like wall the the what's (53:03 - 53:08)
Wally's girlfriend the (53:06 - 53:10)
white robot I felt like it has like a (53:08 - 53:14)
very face like that Eve yeah it has like (53:10 - 53:16)
a weird digital face (53:14 - 53:18)
it seemed like the general consensus was (53:16 - 53:21)
a lot of people were on the Violet fence (53:18 - 53:25)
with miraidon over corridon but in this (53:21 - 53:27)
instance it seemed like everyone was (53:25 - 53:30)
very into the Scarlet prehistoric (53:27 - 53:33)
looking Pokemon versus the uh futuristic (53:30 - 53:34)
one (53:33 - 53:38)
yeah I don't want to live in the past (53:34 - 53:39)
give me the future (53:38 - 53:42)
um which I don't know if Don fan or a (53:39 - 53:44)
Pokemon that looks like Don fan is (53:42 - 53:46)
enough to convince somebody to switch (53:44 - 53:48)
versions don't know (53:46 - 53:50)
um but what I do know it doesn't matter (53:48 - 53:53)
is that (53:50 - 53:54)
uh (53:53 - 53:57)
they've done some weird marketing like (53:54 - 53:59)
this before and we were saying this a (53:57 - 54:00)
little earlier in the break they did (53:59 - 54:02)
this with ultra Beast so they they (54:00 - 54:07)
called like ub-01 ub-02 wasn't like uh (54:02 - 54:10)
but they also had like names it was like (54:07 - 54:10)
poison or whatever like it it was like (54:13 - 54:18)
this long string of names that they used (54:16 - 54:21)
in the marketing but in the game they (54:18 - 54:23)
didn't like kind of mention it at all it (54:21 - 54:25)
was just like this is pointful this is (54:23 - 54:26)
this is I think they talked about them (54:25 - 54:29)
when you were sent off to catch them so (54:26 - 54:30)
they were like oh you need to go and (54:29 - 54:34)
catch yeah one whatever and then well (54:30 - 54:35)
obviously you didn't catch up one that (54:34 - 54:37)
was in this story but anyway (54:35 - 54:39)
um I think you only found out the name (54:37 - 54:41)
once you actually caught it yeah which (54:39 - 54:44)
is very like Legends of like we we don't (54:41 - 54:46)
know what this is but like we know what (54:44 - 54:48)
this we know what it is yeah we know (54:46 - 54:51)
that it's non-fan but I don't know I (54:48 - 54:53)
don't know if the game's gonna be like (54:51 - 54:57)
like I find it hard to believe that you (54:53 - 55:00)
catch prehistoric Dawn fan and then when (54:57 - 55:02)
you send out pretty historic Don fan in (55:00 - 55:05)
a battle it says the monster known as (55:02 - 55:07)
the great Tusk I find that hard to (55:05 - 55:09)
believe yeah that's that's going to be (55:07 - 55:11)
its final name (55:09 - 55:12)
well it's obviously not gonna put the (55:11 - 55:14)
monster cup but I could absolutely see (55:12 - 55:15)
them saying (55:14 - 55:17)
great tusk (55:15 - 55:19)
I could see that (55:17 - 55:21)
but (55:19 - 55:23)
especially if like because like we all (55:21 - 55:25)
know there's some weird there's weird (55:23 - 55:28)
stuff around like this being like you (55:25 - 55:30)
know kind of the past and future stuff (55:28 - 55:33)
and like you know uh Greg was mentioning (55:30 - 55:35)
like the the displaced in time doesn't (55:33 - 55:37)
really exist sort of thing I mean maybe (55:35 - 55:38)
it just doesn't really exist in the (55:37 - 55:40)
novel itself why would you give it a (55:38 - 55:42)
name if it doesn't really exist and you (55:40 - 55:45)
only have the one in existence (55:42 - 55:47)
yeah I guess my question like let's (55:45 - 55:49)
let's say for let's say the Don Fan's (55:47 - 55:51)
known as you catch it you send it out it (55:49 - 55:52)
says great Tusk I think that's a little (55:51 - 55:56)
weird like in in in eight years are we (55:52 - 55:58)
gonna be like hey do I man I miss great (55:56 - 56:00)
Tusk like are you just not gonna say (55:58 - 56:02)
like I I missed dot like I missed the (56:00 - 56:05)
prehistoric Don fan like I mean (56:02 - 56:08)
we call things dumb things all the time (56:05 - 56:12)
yeah like I like iron Treads like oh man (56:08 - 56:15)
iron Treads really like (56:12 - 56:17)
I mean no one's going to say that Phil (56:15 - 56:18)
stop (56:17 - 56:19)
right no one's gonna say iron trade just (56:18 - 56:22)
great right like they're just not (56:19 - 56:23)
again it just kind of reminds me of the (56:22 - 56:25)
UB thing where you know people aren't (56:23 - 56:28)
saying like ubo4 they're just saying (56:25 - 56:31)
naginatal exurgatory look I'm gonna say (56:28 - 56:34)
this ubo4 is a lot easier to say than a (56:31 - 56:36)
lot of those names but yeah you know a (56:34 - 56:38)
lot of people struggle but bless up a (56:36 - 56:40)
lot that's true that's true (56:38 - 56:41)
yeah but can you remember which one is (56:40 - 56:42)
which (56:41 - 56:46)
oh no not at all (56:42 - 56:46)
one is ferrimosa that's the only one I (56:47 - 56:52)
can remember yeah as well as two I know (56:49 - 56:53)
that for sure (56:52 - 56:56)
isn't three (56:53 - 56:59)
the Lily one whatever its name is three (56:56 - 57:00)
is Nile ego (56:59 - 57:02)
sure yeah (57:00 - 57:05)
that would be a good bar trivia this (57:02 - 57:08)
would be like as I was saying the other (57:05 - 57:10)
I was saying yesterday that I don't (57:08 - 57:12)
remember much of my childhood cereal (57:10 - 57:14)
habits because I erased all that all (57:12 - 57:16)
that to put Pokemon names in my brain (57:14 - 57:19)
and I have no more room for matching (57:16 - 57:23)
numbers and names like I'm done I the (57:19 - 57:24)
more I have to remember Pokemon stuff (57:23 - 57:27)
the less I remember about growing up in (57:24 - 57:29)
some cases that's good but I don't get (57:27 - 57:31)
to pick and choose what I forget and (57:29 - 57:34)
that's the bad part (57:31 - 57:34)
I had a speculation and nothing has (57:37 - 57:42)
changed and I did I did not see these (57:40 - 57:45)
Pokemon early for the record I Nintendo (57:42 - 57:47)
was very adamant when I played the game (57:45 - 57:49)
to do a Titan battle (57:47 - 57:50)
um and when I did the Titan battle (57:49 - 57:54)
against cloth which we know was Titan uh (57:50 - 57:57)
the I I didn't defeat it I got it down (57:54 - 58:00)
to like 10 HP and then cloth ran away it (57:57 - 58:01)
like ran down a path that was very (58:00 - 58:03)
obvious to go follow it and then (58:01 - 58:06)
Nintendo was like do not follow it okay (58:03 - 58:09)
do not follow the cloth so it was (58:06 - 58:11)
obvious that I I was going to battle (58:09 - 58:13)
cloth again (58:11 - 58:15)
um (58:13 - 58:17)
but the thing that (58:15 - 58:19)
you know I asked them is you know cloth (58:17 - 58:21)
did not have a level at all (58:19 - 58:23)
no level (58:21 - 58:25)
um although to be fair you could argue (58:23 - 58:26)
that raid Pokemon do not have a level (58:25 - 58:29)
when you go into a three star or four (58:26 - 58:31)
star five star but they do they they do (58:29 - 58:32)
have a secret level we know that (58:31 - 58:35)
five-star Pokemon have (58:32 - 58:38)
um I think they're like 65-ish for a (58:35 - 58:40)
five star (58:38 - 58:41)
um and then we didn't talk about this (58:40 - 58:44)
but that Charizard raid is a seven star (58:41 - 58:47)
which I think you know if there's any (58:44 - 58:49)
takeaway from this entire podcast I (58:47 - 58:51)
think uh Al made a really good point of (58:49 - 58:53)
like you know it seemed like they wanted (58:51 - 58:55)
to do this with Hershey Fu and Mewtwo (58:53 - 58:57)
and Zara Aura and they they didn't have (58:55 - 58:59)
a way to code that in and now they (58:57 - 59:01)
figured it out right so the Charizard (58:59 - 59:04)
the seven star and I think people were (59:01 - 59:06)
saying that were somewhere it said that (59:04 - 59:09)
that Charizard would be level 100. (59:06 - 59:12)
so I know that the I'm pretty sure the (59:09 - 59:14)
zero Aura was actually higher level than (59:12 - 59:15)
normal five stars even though it was a (59:14 - 59:19)
five star yeah in sword and shield (59:15 - 59:20)
um so presumably if they did that again (59:19 - 59:22)
it would be a seven star or six star or (59:20 - 59:26)
where I had the theory playing my (59:22 - 59:29)
experience that the the gyms were left (59:26 - 59:31)
in a not level scaling traditional sense (59:29 - 59:34)
for people who are coming back to (59:31 - 59:36)
Pokemon games which happens more times (59:34 - 59:39)
than people have people give credit for (59:36 - 59:40)
like people step away from the series (59:39 - 59:41)
for five (59:40 - 59:44)
six three years they come back they want (59:41 - 59:45)
that familiarity (59:44 - 59:47)
and to me it felt like the Titan battles (59:45 - 59:51)
were like the new things that scaled (59:47 - 59:53)
um but I don't know maybe maybe the (59:51 - 59:55)
cloth was actually level 20 they just (59:53 - 59:56)
never showed what the level was it will (59:55 - 59:59)
always be level 20 but there is an (59:56 - 60:00)
illusion that like (59:59 - 60:02)
you don't know what the level is so like (60:00 - 60:04)
how do you even prepare for it because (60:02 - 60:07)
it doesn't show you we know that has to (60:04 - 60:08)
have levels because that's how the games (60:07 - 60:12)
work right like but but (60:08 - 60:15)
the game reads your level right and it (60:12 - 60:18)
rounds it up or down probably not that's (60:15 - 60:20)
giving break a lot of credit it probably (60:18 - 60:22)
is run like the ray dens in which the (60:20 - 60:23)
levels (60:22 - 60:25)
jump up (60:23 - 60:29)
when but technically the the DLC did (60:25 - 60:31)
read your data and it did jump up (60:29 - 60:32)
accordingly (60:31 - 60:35)
yeah so they did well they only did two (60:32 - 60:37)
it was right did you beat Leon did you (60:35 - 60:39)
not be yeah (60:37 - 60:43)
so again they could you know when the (60:39 - 60:44)
DLC came out Sergeant Shield was already (60:43 - 60:46)
established that base code was already (60:44 - 60:47)
there there maybe wasn't a way to be (60:46 - 60:49)
more precise and like do you have two (60:47 - 60:51)
badges do you have four badges do you (60:49 - 60:53)
have six they they figured out the right (60:51 - 60:55)
stuff they were like we need Seven Stars (60:53 - 60:58)
there's probably gonna be six we need (60:55 - 61:00)
five stars so maybe they figured out (60:58 - 61:02)
something here (61:00 - 61:05)
um but we're we're assuming that the (61:02 - 61:07)
great Tuscan iron Treads are Titan (61:05 - 61:10)
battles right like yeah I mean they've (61:07 - 61:12)
shown One Titan battle we've shown One (61:10 - 61:16)
Titan battle since then and obviously (61:12 - 61:18)
there will be more (61:16 - 61:20)
I mean (61:18 - 61:24)
the the assumption is Arvin has the book (61:20 - 61:26)
and Arvin is the one that introduces you (61:24 - 61:27)
to the cloth (61:26 - 61:31)
laughs yeah okay but also cloth isn't (61:27 - 61:32)
isn't (61:31 - 61:35)
it's not implied that it's mysterious in (61:32 - 61:37)
the same sort of way like I'm not saying (61:35 - 61:38)
I don't think they'll be Titans but I'm (61:37 - 61:41)
also saying I'm not like I I would (61:38 - 61:43)
expect so if we look at like if we take (61:41 - 61:45)
Legends with the the Titan back then why (61:43 - 61:47)
were they called they have Noble Nobles (61:45 - 61:50)
right like not all of your new Legends (61:47 - 61:52)
Pokemon where even though there were (61:50 - 61:54)
like a handful of them they weren't all (61:52 - 61:57)
Noble battles there was like a selection (61:54 - 61:59)
of them that were (61:57 - 62:01)
um and so like there might be more of (61:59 - 62:02)
these some of which are and some of (62:01 - 62:04)
which aren't like I just don't think we (62:02 - 62:05)
have any kind of indication like the (62:04 - 62:08)
cloth was very definitely big like it (62:05 - 62:11)
was a big boy (62:08 - 62:14)
um yeah I think cloth cloth is the (62:11 - 62:16)
introduction to Titans (62:14 - 62:19)
and I I would I would assume that there (62:16 - 62:24)
the thing that I also again I don't know (62:19 - 62:27)
how many Titans there would be I don't (62:24 - 62:29)
know how many team star people there (62:27 - 62:31)
would be although although the the (62:29 - 62:33)
everyone is saying there's five team (62:31 - 62:34)
stars because it's based off like (62:33 - 62:36)
constellations or something it's a (62:34 - 62:39)
five-pointed star oh well that's it (62:36 - 62:41)
there's five points on a standard star (62:39 - 62:43)
it's a 5. (62:41 - 62:48)
so very likely that there are five teams (62:43 - 62:50)
we know for sure there are eight gym (62:48 - 62:52)
leaders yeah the thing that they haven't (62:50 - 62:55)
told us is how many Titans that yeah I (62:52 - 62:58)
mean it so we know one we know cloth we (62:55 - 63:01)
know cloth it is (62:58 - 63:05)
possible and like to kind of like go off (63:01 - 63:08)
of what Al's saying it is possible that (63:05 - 63:11)
much like Alpha Pokemon exist in Legends (63:08 - 63:14)
Arceus these are alpha Pokemon that (63:11 - 63:17)
exist in the Uncharted reason there may (63:14 - 63:20)
be more of them instead of one Titan (63:17 - 63:22)
they may be Alpha type Pokemon that (63:20 - 63:24)
exist in that region and there'd be (63:22 - 63:27)
multiple of them so like again we don't (63:24 - 63:28)
know which way they're going is it a (63:27 - 63:30)
single battle against a super large one (63:28 - 63:32)
or are they (63:30 - 63:34)
spotting Alphas (63:32 - 63:36)
that have you know unusual names because (63:34 - 63:39)
it's in this Uncharted Territory I don't (63:36 - 63:41)
I don't know people probably do know but (63:39 - 63:43)
also instead of doing (63:41 - 63:45)
be in one game Aleister and the other (63:43 - 63:47)
they're doing great Tusk in one game (63:45 - 63:50)
right iron treads in the other (63:47 - 63:52)
which well yeah I think that's a fair (63:50 - 63:54)
assumption whether they're Titans or not (63:52 - 63:57)
that that's I think that's pretty clear (63:54 - 64:01)
looking Pokemon a future looking Pokemon (63:57 - 64:03)
it's because because they tied it to (64:01 - 64:05)
arvin's storyline which they they they (64:03 - 64:08)
did through can we just we didn't say (64:05 - 64:09)
this (64:08 - 64:14)
the trailer that we're watching had no (64:09 - 64:17)
dialogue no people talking it was just (64:14 - 64:21)
Ed Sheeran singing for four minutes so (64:17 - 64:25)
like I even in the press release it I (64:21 - 64:27)
read it to you guys it says here are the (64:25 - 64:30)
books one book is great Tusk one book is (64:27 - 64:33)
iron Treads but the the unspoken thing (64:30 - 64:35)
is Arvin is the one holding these books (64:33 - 64:38)
and Arvin is the one (64:35 - 64:42)
leading you through the Titan presumably (64:38 - 64:43)
leading you through the Titan stuff (64:42 - 64:45)
because he's the one that says like you (64:43 - 64:48)
should battle cloth right he's like the (64:45 - 64:49)
one that says you should battle cloth (64:48 - 64:52)
the girl with the weird armband I can't (64:49 - 64:54)
remember her neoma is the one saying (64:52 - 64:57)
like we should do the gyms yeah and then (64:54 - 64:59)
I don't know what's implying that you (64:57 - 65:02)
should do team star but the the girl (64:59 - 65:05)
that doesn't come to school (65:02 - 65:08)
oh uh the one with the backpack yeah (65:05 - 65:10)
whatever her name is (65:08 - 65:12)
yeah she's probably the final team start (65:10 - 65:14)
boss they made her all cute and cuddly (65:12 - 65:18)
so she destroys you at the end (65:14 - 65:18)
do you before we move on from The Violet (65:18 - 65:24)
and Scarlet book (65:21 - 65:24)
our (65:25 - 65:32)
does does this change any form of (65:28 - 65:34)
excitement like it's kind of weird that (65:32 - 65:36)
they they they show two (65:34 - 65:41)
Pokemon based off Dawn fan (65:36 - 65:44)
in a trailer with Ed Sheeran and not (65:41 - 65:46)
that air Insurance bad it's just like (65:44 - 65:48)
most of their trainers they're curious (65:46 - 65:50)
where you're going with this most of (65:48 - 65:54)
their trainers trailers explain it a (65:50 - 65:56)
little bit there's no explanation here (65:54 - 65:59)
it is just here are two Don fans Ed (65:56 - 66:01)
Sheeran's in the background we hope you (65:59 - 66:03)
buy our game yeah like it feels like (66:01 - 66:04)
this (66:03 - 66:06)
like they they should have maybe (66:04 - 66:08)
explained what you're going maybe they (66:06 - 66:09)
don't have to maybe people are just so (66:08 - 66:11)
excited I think I think they're just (66:09 - 66:14)
going for the Intrigue yeah because like (66:11 - 66:15)
I also think this there's definitely got (66:14 - 66:19)
to be something to do with like (66:15 - 66:21)
there is no I want to talk about wiggle (66:19 - 66:24)
it right there's no coincidence right (66:21 - 66:26)
the Wiglet looks like Diglett and they (66:24 - 66:28)
talked about that in the in the stuff (66:26 - 66:30)
they did and then we have oh here's two (66:28 - 66:33)
things that look like Don fat like these (66:30 - 66:35)
things I feel have to be connected (66:33 - 66:37)
somehow (66:35 - 66:39)
um (66:37 - 66:39)
so you you know it's not it's not just (66:39 - 66:44)
like you don't think that great Tusk is (66:41 - 66:46)
going to be (66:44 - 66:49)
done like like (66:46 - 66:51)
do you think it's you think it's similar (66:49 - 66:53)
to Wiglet as in like it looks everyone (66:51 - 66:55)
thinks itself yeah okay I see what (66:53 - 66:57)
you're saying possibly and like I don't (66:55 - 66:59)
think the Wiglet just happens to look (66:57 - 67:01)
like the girl I don't think that they've (66:59 - 67:03)
just gone oh this is you know we'll just (67:01 - 67:05)
design a Pokemon and oops it looked like (67:03 - 67:06)
Wiggly right because when they talked (67:05 - 67:07)
about it when they actually talked about (67:06 - 67:10)
what it was called and what it was the (67:07 - 67:11)
whole point of that video was oh it (67:10 - 67:13)
looks like Diglett they actually say (67:11 - 67:15)
that in the reveal (67:13 - 67:18)
the Japanese one that never came yeah (67:15 - 67:20)
yeah yeah yeah we talked about it they (67:18 - 67:23)
don't they don't say that and then not (67:20 - 67:25)
ever talk about it again right they (67:23 - 67:26)
don't say that without knowing what (67:25 - 67:28)
they're doing they don't accidentally (67:26 - 67:30)
designed two Pokemon that look exactly (67:28 - 67:31)
the same without knowing what they're (67:30 - 67:35)
doing with that and then talk about it (67:31 - 67:37)
is this where is this where I go on and (67:35 - 67:39)
I say that I don't think that the the (67:37 - 67:42)
cycle Czar evolves into car ride on and (67:39 - 67:44)
ride on (67:42 - 67:47)
so if all evolves into or is related to (67:44 - 67:50)
uh I think related to is a million (67:47 - 67:54)
percent possible uh because we have not (67:50 - 67:56)
not in a car I don't know I don't think (67:54 - 67:59)
in a car big deal oh you don't think (67:56 - 68:02)
I'll see I I think I think it's a way to (67:59 - 68:05)
me it's a manifestion way now (68:02 - 68:07)
you can breed your legendaries and you (68:05 - 68:09)
get cycler (68:07 - 68:12)
but cycler cannot evolve into (68:09 - 68:14)
interesting I didn't think about that I (68:12 - 68:16)
like that theory though I'm very into (68:14 - 68:19)
that I mean they I don't think Cycles (68:16 - 68:22)
are evolves into karate Omni ride on I I (68:19 - 68:23)
still think that is a definite (68:22 - 68:27)
possibility but I haven't seen leaks so (68:23 - 68:32)
yeah I don't think this is happening I (68:27 - 68:33)
have looked at the links and you (68:32 - 68:35)
actually know and you're just leading me (68:33 - 68:40)
on so but I I do like how Al circled the (68:35 - 68:43)
Don fan stuff back to Wiglet (68:40 - 68:43)
I was like because I I think that I (68:43 - 68:48)
think we've all just stopped talking (68:46 - 68:49)
about Wiglet (68:48 - 68:52)
yeah this is bad no wait why are you out (68:49 - 68:57)
of your mind it's long look I just a lot (68:52 - 68:59)
of things (68:57 - 69:01)
yeah no no that's not true alone (68:59 - 69:04)
executor long and great uh gigantom Max (69:01 - 69:07)
Meowth long and gray no Wiglet long gray (69:04 - 69:08)
oh man (69:07 - 69:11)
uh (69:08 - 69:11)
here's here's the other thing I I just (69:16 - 69:21)
thought of we've only seen one pound (69:19 - 69:24)
Pokemon right Am I Wrong you've only (69:21 - 69:26)
seen Whooper well we've only seen pale (69:24 - 69:28)
Dan whooper (69:26 - 69:30)
and because everyone thought pal day (69:28 - 69:34)
paldayin Diglett right yeah that is (69:30 - 69:36)
Wiglet (69:34 - 69:37)
yeah I'm just double checking list (69:36 - 69:39)
official list yeah (69:37 - 69:41)
at this point yeah there's only the (69:39 - 69:44)
Evolution for draft rig which isn't (69:41 - 69:47)
palday and it's just an evolution (69:44 - 69:47)
um so I think (69:50 - 69:54)
I would say that this marketing reminds (69:52 - 69:58)
me of X and Y where they tried (69:54 - 70:01)
to not the the thing about X and Y (69:58 - 70:03)
marketing and I remember this very well (70:01 - 70:05)
because like when the show when this (70:03 - 70:07)
podcast started we started shortly after (70:05 - 70:09)
heart gold soul silver no surprises (70:07 - 70:11)
there it was just a remake and then (70:09 - 70:14)
black and white was coming out and that (70:11 - 70:15)
was (70:14 - 70:17)
you know the US (70:15 - 70:20)
and for Al the the you know Europe had (70:17 - 70:23)
to wait eight months because it came to (70:20 - 70:25)
Japan first and everyone else had to (70:23 - 70:27)
wait so we knew we we looked at the (70:25 - 70:30)
entire Pokedex and we saw everything and (70:27 - 70:32)
we were building our teams people wanted (70:30 - 70:33)
Chandelure on their teams and people (70:32 - 70:35)
hated sock and throw before they they (70:33 - 70:37)
came out like people still hate soccer (70:35 - 70:39)
but like there were there was eight (70:37 - 70:40)
months of waiting for these games to (70:39 - 70:43)
come out to the U.S and then the whole (70:40 - 70:45)
deal about X and Y was it was like this (70:43 - 70:47)
big worldwide game and the Pokemon (70:45 - 70:49)
company knew that and they wanted (70:47 - 70:52)
everyone to experience and have these (70:49 - 70:55)
surprises at the same time (70:52 - 70:56)
and then that game leaked and you know (70:55 - 70:58)
it leaked in various ways you know (70:56 - 71:00)
everyone well I don't know if everyone (70:58 - 71:02)
but I remember the dude that got it in (71:00 - 71:04)
Canada he his friend sold it from (71:02 - 71:06)
GameStop and he was posting things on (71:04 - 71:08)
Instagram and people were running to (71:06 - 71:11)
Instagram to see like what these Pokemon (71:08 - 71:13)
evolved into or to see skadoo for the (71:11 - 71:15)
not the first time but like to see like (71:13 - 71:17)
these new Pokemon through Instagram (71:15 - 71:18)
posts (71:17 - 71:20)
um and then all of a sudden you know his (71:18 - 71:22)
Instagram disappeared and the word on (71:20 - 71:24)
the street was Nintendo you know sent (71:22 - 71:28)
them to Azkaban but (71:24 - 71:28)
they did a pretty (71:28 - 71:32)
we're not going we're going to show you (71:31 - 71:34)
enough to get you excited but we want to (71:32 - 71:36)
save all these surprises and secrets for (71:34 - 71:39)
you and then in the in the (71:36 - 71:43)
uh sun and moon era (71:39 - 71:44)
they (71:43 - 71:47)
they went the complete opposite it felt (71:44 - 71:49)
like every week they were showing two to (71:47 - 71:53)
three new Pokemon and it was every week (71:49 - 71:54)
we were getting something new and it was (71:53 - 71:56)
like whoa (71:54 - 71:58)
here's everything (71:56 - 72:01)
and then for sword and shield they kind (71:58 - 72:03)
of took steps back (72:01 - 72:05)
and for this game it took it it feels (72:03 - 72:06)
like they went all the way back to X and (72:05 - 72:08)
Y where they were confident that they (72:06 - 72:10)
don't have to show a lot to sell these (72:08 - 72:11)
games maybe because they were so (72:10 - 72:14)
confident in the fact that these games (72:11 - 72:15)
are open world and that's what people (72:14 - 72:18)
wanted and they they had a huge ego (72:15 - 72:22)
boost from selling 26 million copies of (72:18 - 72:25)
sword and shield like just a reminder to (72:22 - 72:26)
everyone that sword and shield are the (72:25 - 72:29)
second best-selling Pokemon games of all (72:26 - 72:33)
time and that has not been beaten in 23 (72:29 - 72:36)
years I also think the the thing about (72:33 - 72:37)
sun and moon is what's happening during (72:36 - 72:40)
their 20th anniversary right like (72:37 - 72:42)
they were really hitting the 20th (72:40 - 72:44)
anniversary (72:42 - 72:47)
thing hard way better than the 25th so (72:44 - 72:50)
like I don't I don't know that I think (72:47 - 72:52)
their normal (72:50 - 72:54)
non-anniversary aspect of approaching (72:52 - 72:56)
games is to is to Dole it out and keep (72:54 - 72:59)
the mystery and sun and moon happened (72:56 - 73:01)
right when Pokemon go was gonna come out (72:59 - 73:03)
the 20th anniversary and so they were (73:01 - 73:06)
just really flooding (73:03 - 73:08)
the sort of Engagement excitement cycle (73:06 - 73:10)
of them celebrating the 20th anniversary (73:08 - 73:12)
I think their normal way is doing it (73:10 - 73:14)
like they do for X and Y like then it's (73:12 - 73:16)
forced heart and shield and like they're (73:14 - 73:18)
doing it here I think because of the (73:16 - 73:21)
20th anniversary Sun and Moon are the (73:18 - 73:23)
exception to how they normally go about (73:21 - 73:25)
business (73:23 - 73:25)
yes (73:27 - 73:33)
I mean I agree it it does there there's (73:30 - 73:35)
like Alan and I couldn't help ourselves (73:33 - 73:37)
we looked at some of the leaks totally (73:35 - 73:40)
fine I guess whatever some of the leaks (73:37 - 73:44)
uh there's even a league channel in the (73:40 - 73:46)
slack that I refuse to go yeah look (73:44 - 73:48)
there's there's also studies out there (73:46 - 73:51)
that show that you know (73:48 - 73:53)
ing the ending of a movie doesn't (73:51 - 73:56)
technically doesn't ruin your experience (73:53 - 73:57)
of it so (73:56 - 73:59)
there are multiple studies that show (73:57 - 74:02)
knowing spoilers doesn't ruin your (73:59 - 74:04)
experience and I again I want to stress (74:02 - 74:07)
I am not (74:04 - 74:09)
against spoilers because I will be (74:07 - 74:13)
spoiling myself midnight on Thursday I'm (74:09 - 74:15)
against the current league culture of (74:13 - 74:18)
people who don't have the community's (74:15 - 74:21)
best interest in mind to put things in (74:18 - 74:24)
who put things out months in advance who (74:21 - 74:26)
put false things in with true things who (74:24 - 74:29)
manipulate the community for views for (74:26 - 74:32)
clout to get people upset that is the (74:29 - 74:33)
culture I'm gonna get and that's what I (74:32 - 74:36)
will not give into I can wait like (74:33 - 74:38)
people like have you looked at the leaks (74:36 - 74:41)
and no again it's not because I hate (74:38 - 74:43)
being spoiled like we will talk about (74:41 - 74:45)
shortly with the anime that doesn't (74:43 - 74:48)
bother me what bothers me is this (74:45 - 74:51)
culture beforehand of people who could (74:48 - 74:54)
give a flip about the fans in the (74:51 - 74:55)
community (74:54 - 74:59)
and are just trying to (74:55 - 75:01)
trick people or pull one over on people (74:59 - 75:03)
or or do most of the various things that (75:01 - 75:05)
they do yeah (75:03 - 75:08)
or content creators or a lot of them (75:05 - 75:10)
time they're not even that they're (75:08 - 75:11)
they're out there for themselves right (75:10 - 75:14)
right how can I figure out how shiny (75:11 - 75:15)
hunting Works before everyone else (75:14 - 75:19)
because I want those views I want that (75:15 - 75:21)
successful YouTube video to get the (75:19 - 75:24)
money to get the subscribers if I tell (75:21 - 75:27)
you how Wiglet evolves I'm assuming (75:24 - 75:30)
Wiglet evolves uh (75:27 - 75:32)
does that get me more retweets than (75:30 - 75:34)
somebody else because I said it first (75:32 - 75:36)
right like they they're they're not here (75:34 - 75:38)
for (75:36 - 75:41)
you know satisfying people's maybe maybe (75:38 - 75:42)
there's one or two out there that are (75:41 - 75:44)
like trying to leak properly to you know (75:42 - 75:48)
but like I watched a twitch stream of (75:44 - 75:50)
somebody playing it and the they they (75:48 - 75:51)
had 400 people I promise you I'm not (75:50 - 75:53)
gonna spoil anything they had 400 people (75:51 - 75:56)
watching them play and I I laughed (75:53 - 75:58)
because in in their stream title it said (75:56 - 76:01)
cartridge player (75:58 - 76:02)
um and I laughed because it was It was (76:01 - 76:04)
obviously they were obviously not (76:02 - 76:06)
running a cartridge they were running an (76:04 - 76:08)
emulation of it right like like most (76:06 - 76:10)
people are running in them and you can (76:08 - 76:11)
tell they're running an emulation (76:10 - 76:12)
because every time they use the move (76:11 - 76:14)
snarl (76:12 - 76:17)
the whole game would like drop a million (76:14 - 76:20)
frames and it was like very Jagged and (76:17 - 76:22)
they had 400 people watching they had no (76:20 - 76:23)
camera they weren't talking they were (76:22 - 76:25)
just playing the game was running (76:23 - 76:28)
terribly and I I laughed because their (76:25 - 76:30)
stream title said cartridge (76:28 - 76:31)
um and everyone in chat was talking (76:30 - 76:33)
about like where's the site to get the (76:31 - 76:35)
emulation right like everyone was like (76:33 - 76:37)
where where can I download it (76:35 - 76:38)
um (76:37 - 76:41)
but I was watching this player and for (76:38 - 76:43)
some reason they had a team of brand new (76:41 - 76:45)
Pokemon and they were obsessed with (76:43 - 76:47)
Fletchling they like wasted all of their (76:45 - 76:50)
materials on a Fletchling and they (76:47 - 76:51)
eventually caught the Fletchling and (76:50 - 76:52)
then they decided they were going to use (76:51 - 76:54)
the Fletchling and I'm like you have so (76:52 - 76:57)
many new Pokemon but you you you want to (76:54 - 76:58)
use the Fletchling that's cool whatever (76:57 - 77:01)
man and then I watched them attack a (76:58 - 77:03)
hoppip I'm pretty sure hop up it's been (77:01 - 77:05)
shown off but (77:03 - 77:09)
um the hoppip only new Splash and it was (77:05 - 77:11)
just splashing and I watched him (77:09 - 77:14)
continue to growl this hoppip growl (77:11 - 77:18)
lowering attack the hoppip doesn't have (77:14 - 77:20)
an attack it's splashing (77:18 - 77:23)
um and I'm just like (77:20 - 77:23)
how did I get here (77:25 - 77:31)
why would you get there I couldn't stop (77:28 - 77:32)
watching (77:31 - 77:34)
supporting these people and then I (77:32 - 77:37)
watched him attack a trainer who had a (77:34 - 77:39)
mud Bray mudbray has been confirmed you (77:37 - 77:41)
know we we love horses in the back and (77:39 - 77:43)
this mud Bray just went through his team (77:41 - 77:45)
just destroyed his entire I was like (77:43 - 77:48)
this man is going to lose to a level 14 (77:45 - 77:50)
mud Bray in front of 400 people this is (77:48 - 77:52)
embarrassing I need to see this through (77:50 - 77:55)
but I think to myself (77:52 - 77:57)
this this person went out of their way (77:55 - 77:59)
to download (77:57 - 78:03)
an emulation of a brand new game to in (77:59 - 78:05)
fact get an audience to watch them have (78:03 - 78:07)
they they don't care about Pokemon it's (78:05 - 78:09)
like maybe they do maybe they just (78:07 - 78:11)
haven't played Pokemon in 10 years and (78:09 - 78:13)
they they forgot what the move growl did (78:11 - 78:15)
but like (78:13 - 78:17)
what are you doing man like what what is (78:15 - 78:20)
your end goal here because if your end (78:17 - 78:22)
goal is to spoil it for people you're (78:20 - 78:24)
doing a really bad job and if your end (78:22 - 78:27)
goal is to like enjoy the game maybe I (78:24 - 78:28)
don't know maybe you are you're also (78:27 - 78:30)
doing a bad job but also you know I saw (78:28 - 78:33)
these players play do this the same for (78:30 - 78:34)
sword and shield right this is this is (78:33 - 78:36)
part of why sword and shield got a bad (78:34 - 78:38)
rap because (78:36 - 78:41)
sword and shield all these people were (78:38 - 78:44)
emulating it and then read it and (78:41 - 78:46)
Twitter these people that were so (78:44 - 78:48)
against sword and shield because of the (78:46 - 78:49)
national decks who are saying look at (78:48 - 78:51)
this this when you battle zashi and (78:49 - 78:54)
zamasenta there's not even music when (78:51 - 78:55)
you when you climb up this ladder the (78:54 - 78:58)
game breaks when you do this the frame (78:55 - 79:01)
rate looks terrible yeah because none of (78:58 - 79:02)
these players were playing on a (79:01 - 79:04)
cartridge they were playing on a very (79:02 - 79:07)
poor emulation version and that's what (79:04 - 79:10)
people are seeing and it look look if if (79:07 - 79:11)
there was somebody who was actually (79:10 - 79:13)
playing with a cartridge actually knew (79:11 - 79:15)
what they were doing actually was trying (79:13 - 79:17)
to engage with their audience they would (79:15 - 79:19)
actually probably help Nintendo out and (79:17 - 79:21)
be like wow people are excited but the (79:19 - 79:24)
people running emulations with with no (79:21 - 79:27)
talking can't even play the game when (79:24 - 79:28)
you look at it I I sat there and I was (79:27 - 79:31)
like I know this is emulation I I know (79:28 - 79:32)
this dude has no clue what they're doing (79:31 - 79:34)
but if I if I was on the fence about (79:32 - 79:37)
Pokemon that stream (79:34 - 79:40)
felt like it would hurt yeah potential (79:37 - 79:43)
sales because it looks and it runs so (79:40 - 79:46)
poorly and there's no way to be like I (79:43 - 79:47)
mean if you know nothing about what's (79:46 - 79:48)
happening right (79:47 - 79:52)
and you read in the title cartridge like (79:48 - 79:54)
everything about that is just like I (79:52 - 79:56)
understand why Nintendo's taking these (79:54 - 79:59)
streams down it's not because they well (79:56 - 80:00)
they obviously they care about being (79:59 - 80:03)
spoiled but it does such (80:00 - 80:06)
a poor job at selling this game does a (80:03 - 80:07)
disservice to their game because it's (80:06 - 80:09)
not the final product it does a (80:07 - 80:12)
disservice to the community because you (80:09 - 80:13)
know if people are on the fence and (80:12 - 80:14)
they're like oh I'm gonna go watch the (80:13 - 80:17)
game and it looks like trash (80:14 - 80:19)
like (80:17 - 80:23)
it it frustrates me because I again I (80:19 - 80:27)
look I read movie plots before I go see (80:23 - 80:29)
them if I think I I don't know if I want (80:27 - 80:30)
to sit through this because it doesn't (80:29 - 80:33)
matter to me that that it's quote (80:30 - 80:35)
unquote spoiled because (80:33 - 80:38)
I will have an experience watching the (80:35 - 80:40)
film that's not spoiled by me knowing (80:38 - 80:44)
like part of part of films is how they (80:40 - 80:47)
uh reveal and tell you the story of how (80:44 - 80:49)
they got there it's the fact that these (80:47 - 80:51)
people really just (80:49 - 80:54)
do not give (80:51 - 80:57)
any care about what they're doing for (80:54 - 80:59)
this franchise for these cartridges they (80:57 - 81:01)
are just doing it for themselves they (80:59 - 81:02)
don't care if they're right they don't (81:01 - 81:04)
care if they're wrong because they're (81:02 - 81:06)
there to make a splash and disappear and (81:04 - 81:09)
watch the chaos that comes after and (81:06 - 81:11)
even with even with Legends Arceus same (81:09 - 81:13)
thing right people were running emulated (81:11 - 81:16)
versions early and I again I I tuned in (81:13 - 81:18)
because I'm I'm curious behind like the (81:16 - 81:20)
thought process of what they're doing (81:18 - 81:21)
and you know you see these people with (81:20 - 81:23)
400 500 people watching them play (81:21 - 81:26)
Legends and then (81:23 - 81:28)
the next day they switched to fortnite (81:26 - 81:31)
or Call of Duty and they have three (81:28 - 81:33)
people watching like it's almost like (81:31 - 81:35)
yeah well if I can stream this game (81:33 - 81:37)
early which has obviously like whether (81:35 - 81:39)
or not you like Pokemon Pokemon is a (81:37 - 81:43)
huge franchise with a huge fan base and (81:39 - 81:47)
um it attracts eyes and it's it's like (81:43 - 81:49)
the reason you have two to three people (81:47 - 81:51)
watching you play fortnite (81:49 - 81:54)
is because you're not a very interesting (81:51 - 81:57)
streamer you're not like and that sounds (81:54 - 82:00)
mean but like you know there are plenty (81:57 - 82:01)
of successful fortnite streamers out (82:00 - 82:02)
there they're successful because they're (82:01 - 82:04)
good because they're entertaining (82:02 - 82:05)
because they're funny because they they (82:04 - 82:09)
provide some value the value you are (82:05 - 82:11)
providing to streaming Legends Arceus (82:09 - 82:13)
early is no one else is (82:11 - 82:15)
and as soon as other people are or as (82:13 - 82:18)
soon as you switch your value goes away (82:15 - 82:20)
yeah um (82:18 - 82:23)
and even when you're streaming Legends (82:20 - 82:25)
or in this case streaming scarlet and (82:23 - 82:26)
violet and 400 people are watching you (82:25 - 82:28)
lose to a mud Bray because you don't (82:26 - 82:31)
understand how bold those Works (82:28 - 82:34)
your value is you're the only person (82:31 - 82:37)
right now streaming this and you're not (82:34 - 82:39)
doing it very well (82:37 - 82:42)
um but yeah it just uh it's frustrating (82:39 - 82:45)
because (82:42 - 82:45)
what what Greg said a lot of people are (82:45 - 82:50)
leaking because they're trying to take (82:48 - 82:53)
advantage and manipulate to get some (82:50 - 82:56)
sort of benefit instead of like (82:53 - 83:00)
you know I'm I I I they genuinely care (82:56 - 83:01)
about Pokemon or they genuinely care (83:00 - 83:04)
about their community in some sense (83:01 - 83:07)
and it kind of goes back to like (83:04 - 83:07)
it kind of goes back to like a month ago (83:08 - 83:13)
when I played scarlet and violet early (83:10 - 83:14)
and Nintendo was like well you you can (83:13 - 83:16)
play for an hour your appointment is two (83:14 - 83:18)
hours and I saw all of these other (83:16 - 83:20)
people that had the same appointment as (83:18 - 83:21)
me going like I played for two hours I (83:20 - 83:23)
played for three hours like why are you (83:21 - 83:26)
lying to your community what benefit do (83:23 - 83:28)
you get that one person said they played (83:26 - 83:29)
for one hour and you're saying you (83:28 - 83:33)
played for three hours like why like if (83:29 - 83:36)
like it just frustrates me so much that (83:33 - 83:38)
people support like I don't know it's (83:36 - 83:40)
just like this well I played for three (83:38 - 83:43)
hours so watch my YouTube video like (83:40 - 83:46)
what you played for an hour man an hour (83:43 - 83:48)
15 if you're being generous because I (83:46 - 83:50)
don't know if you know this you did a (83:48 - 83:51)
Raid Battle I did a Raid Battle those (83:50 - 83:53)
raid battles are time 10 minutes it (83:51 - 83:55)
couldn't have been an hour raid battle (83:53 - 83:58)
there's a 10 minute timer like come on (83:55 - 84:02)
just like stop taking advantage of the (83:58 - 84:05)
people who who have put you in this (84:02 - 84:08)
privileged position (84:05 - 84:10)
like I wonder what their long-term (84:08 - 84:12)
strategy is with this and I guess the (84:10 - 84:13)
answer is they don't have one they don't (84:12 - 84:15)
have one (84:13 - 84:17)
right because let me tell you I have (84:15 - 84:19)
that exact experience in other ways of (84:17 - 84:22)
getting a massive audience for a very (84:19 - 84:23)
short period of time they don't stick (84:22 - 84:25)
around if you don't keep doing the same (84:23 - 84:27)
thing so like I got a massively viral (84:25 - 84:30)
Tick Tock once it got over a million (84:27 - 84:33)
views like insane (84:30 - 84:36)
um and uh my highest since then has been (84:33 - 84:38)
like ten thousand so if you don't keep (84:36 - 84:40)
doing the exact same thing that they (84:38 - 84:41)
want they just they won't stick around (84:40 - 84:44)
it's like they won't go oh I found your (84:41 - 84:46)
your Lego building interesting that's (84:44 - 84:47)
fine I'll stay for your random political (84:46 - 84:49)
rants like of course they're not gonna (84:47 - 84:52)
do that right right I always think like (84:49 - 84:54)
the example of (84:52 - 84:57)
this the darkness that people exist (84:54 - 84:58)
where (84:57 - 85:01)
the people who (84:58 - 85:01)
bought a Harry Potter book (85:02 - 85:06)
or at the front of the line quickly or (85:04 - 85:08)
at the back and then went up and down (85:06 - 85:10)
the line of people waiting screaming (85:08 - 85:13)
what the ending was right like these are (85:10 - 85:16)
these people this is why I have a pre (85:13 - 85:20)
and and the stuff with like I was (85:16 - 85:21)
already kind of against people doing (85:20 - 85:24)
that to begin with from those examples (85:21 - 85:26)
and then sword and shield really (85:24 - 85:29)
solidified the cold nugget I have in my (85:26 - 85:31)
heart for leakers where I'm like I give (85:29 - 85:35)
none of you anything anymore I I I I I (85:31 - 85:38)
think you are a blight on fandoms at (85:35 - 85:40)
this point because you (85:38 - 85:42)
you are (85:40 - 85:45)
there to make people suffer more than (85:42 - 85:48)
you're there to breathe bring them up (85:45 - 85:48)
speaking of suffering Pokemon home (85:50 - 85:57)
uh why am I still paying for the (85:53 - 85:59)
surprise of the century (85:57 - 86:02)
uh the latest battle statistics from (85:59 - 86:04)
Pokemon scarlet and violet will be soon (86:02 - 86:05)
available in the mobile device of (86:04 - 86:08)
Pokemon home uh from the app players are (86:05 - 86:09)
able to view information about trainers (86:08 - 86:11)
ranking frequently used Pokemon online (86:09 - 86:13)
competitions I don't know somebody at (86:11 - 86:15)
game freak figured out the picolytics (86:13 - 86:17)
existed uh players will be able to see (86:15 - 86:19)
what moves abilities held items are (86:17 - 86:22)
being used in battle this update is (86:19 - 86:26)
scheduled for early 2023 compatibility (86:22 - 86:29)
oh go ahead so I was just going to say (86:26 - 86:30)
to be fair this information was (86:29 - 86:32)
available previously it was just only on (86:30 - 86:35)
their website and like at certain points (86:32 - 86:37)
like after certain competitions they (86:35 - 86:39)
would put this information up yeah they (86:37 - 86:40)
don't have like an ongoing good so this (86:39 - 86:41)
is this is good I like this (86:40 - 86:44)
compatibility between Scarlet Violet (86:41 - 86:48)
home is slated for spring of 2023 (86:44 - 86:50)
um (86:48 - 86:50)
I don't know what happened but so many (86:51 - 86:56)
people thought that (86:54 - 86:58)
home was supposed to come out for (86:56 - 87:02)
Legends and bdsp spring of 2022 it (86:58 - 87:04)
didn't end up coming until what like (87:02 - 87:06)
June (87:04 - 87:06)
it wasn't that late it wasn't June (87:07 - 87:15)
but I don't there for the time stamp (87:11 - 87:17)
this podcast they're saying spring of (87:15 - 87:18)
2020. this is what I'm saying because (87:17 - 87:21)
like like yeah I felt like they did say (87:18 - 87:24)
spring of 2022 and then when when I (87:21 - 87:25)
looked and when I researched I couldn't (87:24 - 87:29)
find anything about spring but I swore (87:25 - 87:30)
when they originally and a lot of people (87:29 - 87:32)
did a lot of people thought oh I wasn't (87:30 - 87:35)
alone a lot of people thought early but (87:32 - 87:37)
they're saying spring of 2023 (87:35 - 87:39)
um after players have linked either (87:37 - 87:41)
titled the home they'll be able to (87:39 - 87:42)
transfer Pokemon between scarlet and (87:41 - 87:45)
violet to home and bring Pokemon from (87:42 - 87:47)
past games into the paldeo region (87:45 - 87:49)
nowhere in here does it say if it (87:47 - 87:50)
touched paldea it can go back to the (87:49 - 87:54)
sword and shield unsure of that in in (87:50 - 87:57)
the past that hasn't been available (87:54 - 88:01)
yeah I'd be surprised I mean we don't (87:57 - 88:03)
again modification we don't actually (88:01 - 88:05)
know whether they have any changes to (88:03 - 88:07)
the the Pokemon data structure in this (88:05 - 88:09)
generation or not I'm guessing they must (88:07 - 88:12)
do because they have the terror type in (88:09 - 88:14)
which case I don't say why they would (88:12 - 88:16)
change their strategy and suddenly have (88:14 - 88:18)
a backwards compatibility with it (88:16 - 88:23)
but it's possible as possible (88:18 - 88:25)
um they have done some stuff weird stuff (88:23 - 88:28)
with the Legends stuff yeah I mean (88:25 - 88:31)
they but that wasn't (88:28 - 88:34)
also a very tiny game shall we say (88:31 - 88:36)
true (88:34 - 88:37)
um (88:36 - 88:39)
it is confirmed that linking scarlet and (88:37 - 88:41)
violet to go will allow you to receive (88:39 - 88:46)
gimme Gore roaming form in Pokemon go (88:41 - 88:47)
um (88:46 - 88:50)
and then uh players who with save data (88:47 - 88:51)
from Legends Arceus brilliant Diamond (88:50 - 88:54)
shining pearl sword or Shield let's go (88:51 - 88:56)
Pikachu let's go Eevee we'll receive a (88:54 - 88:58)
phone case Rotom phone case in the (88:56 - 89:01)
respective games if you have all four (88:58 - 89:04)
or in this case two four six seven games (89:01 - 89:06)
you get all four cases (89:04 - 89:08)
you're not getting a different case for (89:06 - 89:10)
let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee one (89:08 - 89:12)
of those two games will give you the (89:10 - 89:14)
let's go Pikachu case (89:12 - 89:15)
um but it's not like you get to if you (89:14 - 89:16)
have all the games you don't get you get (89:15 - 89:18)
all of it so you don't get to just pick (89:16 - 89:20)
one I know that was a freaking question (89:18 - 89:23)
the I'm gonna say that uh you clearly (89:20 - 89:26)
had a hand in designing these game cases (89:23 - 89:29)
because when flipped horizontal the eyes (89:26 - 89:31)
don't go horizontal like they do in (89:29 - 89:33)
sword and shield they stay in their (89:31 - 89:36)
vertical form good so you're a garbage (89:33 - 89:38)
human for making that happen in this (89:36 - 89:41)
game because it looks bad (89:38 - 89:46)
good uh I'm glad uh and that's uh that's (89:41 - 89:47)
that's pretty much it finally there will (89:46 - 89:50)
be a day one patch for these games uh it (89:47 - 89:52)
will go from (89:50 - 89:57)
1.0.0 to 1.0.1 it should be about one (89:52 - 90:00)
gig basically have a day one patch I (89:57 - 90:01)
believe sword and shield did I think the (90:00 - 90:03)
old house I think yeah Legends they're (90:01 - 90:06)
doing bdspe both did as well (90:03 - 90:09)
patches sort of Shield did because it (90:06 - 90:11)
had to add the missing music from the (90:09 - 90:13)
song oh yeah (90:11 - 90:17)
oh yeah uh bdsp had two D1 patches yeah (90:13 - 90:20)
it's bizarre yeah (90:17 - 90:23)
still you know still bad (90:20 - 90:27)
crazy I mean there's a lot of bugs that (90:23 - 90:29)
they had to add to day away I do want to (90:27 - 90:32)
say one thing I again (90:29 - 90:35)
spoilers are not spoilers The the shiny (90:32 - 90:37)
the starters are shiny locked I I do (90:35 - 90:40)
want to say that it's not briefcase (90:37 - 90:43)
simulator I know some people spend sixty (90:40 - 90:45)
dollars to turn on and off their game (90:43 - 90:46)
over and over in front of a briefcase (90:45 - 90:51)
don't yuck their yum uh do you do it (90:46 - 90:54)
you know honestly briefcase simulator (90:51 - 90:55)
probably the best part about Diamond and (90:54 - 90:57)
Pearl at this point you know that (90:55 - 90:59)
briefcase was really well animated (90:57 - 91:02)
looked beautiful great colors (90:59 - 91:05)
um you can't do this with you want you (91:02 - 91:08)
want a different color for Coco too bad (91:05 - 91:10)
as I said you're gonna have to read it (91:08 - 91:12)
there there is the argument where people (91:10 - 91:14)
are like I spent the money on the game (91:12 - 91:15)
let me play the game how I want (91:14 - 91:18)
but there's also the argument of (91:15 - 91:21)
look game freak wants you to explore the (91:18 - 91:24)
thing they made go do it I thought they (91:21 - 91:25)
don't explore the game after they spent (91:24 - 91:28)
60 hours opening and closing the is that (91:25 - 91:30)
true because I have talked to a lot of (91:28 - 91:31)
people who have never gotten past (91:30 - 91:33)
briefcase simulator so I don't know if (91:31 - 91:37)
that's true it is true I (91:33 - 91:37)
to be fair there's not a lot to see over (91:43 - 91:48)
there to be fair they've had the best (91:46 - 91:50)
experience a brilliant Diamond shiny (91:48 - 91:51)
book as the rest of us who win exploring (91:50 - 91:54)
were like this is garbage (91:51 - 91:57)
I agree with the point that yes you (91:54 - 91:58)
should let me play the game however I (91:57 - 92:01)
want but I would also say it's not like (91:58 - 92:03)
they're not letting you get the shiny (92:01 - 92:03)
Pokemon (92:03 - 92:06)
and it's just this one specific way of (92:03 - 92:09)
getting that Pokemon right like breeding (92:06 - 92:10)
is a thing that has been in these games (92:09 - 92:12)
and also if you're the person who's like (92:10 - 92:14)
oh I really hope that we can do this (92:12 - 92:17)
right give up they're never gonna give (92:14 - 92:19)
you a shiny starter ever again it's just (92:17 - 92:21)
not happening no no starters and no (92:19 - 92:23)
Legends will ever be a shiny in a (92:21 - 92:26)
Pokemon game again it's just the way it (92:23 - 92:27)
is deal with it (92:26 - 92:29)
and for those saying well they did for (92:27 - 92:31)
brilliant Diamond shining Pro that the (92:29 - 92:33)
faithful (92:31 - 92:36)
yeah come on Facebook remix aren't you (92:33 - 92:39)
on the shaman shiny hunt now (92:36 - 92:43)
I am I am no and you just (92:39 - 92:46)
getting over that they'll never have (92:43 - 92:47)
well (92:46 - 92:50)
you are you are literally not playing a (92:47 - 92:53)
game right now so you can hunt chime in (92:50 - 92:57)
but I think you are a better act Greg I (92:53 - 92:59)
think you'll find this is my dedicated (92:57 - 93:03)
Shaman shiny hunting switch (92:59 - 93:03)
it's even joking (93:04 - 93:09)
I'm playing other games on (93:06 - 93:12)
timeline (93:09 - 93:12)
they're it that you know if (93:14 - 93:17)
to me and I don't know if this is the (93:19 - 93:23)
way game freak or the Pokemon company or (93:21 - 93:26)
Nintendo thinks is like (93:23 - 93:29)
if your experience is only the first (93:26 - 93:32)
five minutes of the game over and over (93:29 - 93:34)
and over and over again (93:32 - 93:37)
how can you fall in love with that game (93:34 - 93:40)
and I think that's important to them of (93:37 - 93:42)
like the reason that people have such (93:40 - 93:44)
fond memories of heart gold soul silver (93:42 - 93:46)
is because they they went through the (93:44 - 93:49)
whole game they they reached it to Red (93:46 - 93:51)
they had Pokemon following them they saw (93:49 - 93:54)
Kanto again like there are reasons why (93:51 - 93:56)
people's favorite Pokemon games are (93:54 - 93:59)
their favorite Pokemon games none of (93:56 - 94:01)
those reasons are I sat there and I (93:59 - 94:03)
turned on and off the game over and over (94:01 - 94:05)
and I got a slightly different colored (94:03 - 94:08)
Pokemon like in order for Game Freak to (94:05 - 94:10)
get people to fall in love with the game (94:08 - 94:13)
they have to see what they created (94:10 - 94:16)
and they know people are doing this they (94:13 - 94:18)
know people are doing this that's why (94:16 - 94:21)
they locked it they know people want (94:18 - 94:25)
specific shinies like Zygarde they (94:21 - 94:26)
locked it so they can have a (94:25 - 94:29)
distribution or in a future game they (94:26 - 94:32)
can give it to you this is intentional (94:29 - 94:35)
this isn't because they don't care they (94:32 - 94:37)
do care about how they control their own (94:35 - 94:41)
narrative to their own game and it's the (94:37 - 94:44)
same with the national decks they know (94:41 - 94:46)
that even though there was all that (94:44 - 94:48)
commotion on Twitter or Reddit or (94:46 - 94:50)
Discord or wherever people complained (94:48 - 94:54)
they know that that decision (94:50 - 94:58)
was going to play out for them in the (94:54 - 95:00)
for their favor in the long run they (94:58 - 95:03)
know that by taking away Pokemon and (95:00 - 95:06)
then reintroducing them it gets people (95:03 - 95:09)
excited like oh my gosh my favorite (95:06 - 95:11)
Pokemon is finally coming back to this (95:09 - 95:13)
game and I can go find them and get them (95:11 - 95:16)
again I think it's it's the we're (95:13 - 95:18)
pushing you to play this game because (95:16 - 95:20)
we're confident in what we made and you (95:18 - 95:22)
will love it and if you really want a (95:20 - 95:25)
shiny sprigatito you can still get it (95:22 - 95:28)
just not here go out it's almost like (95:25 - 95:30)
it's almost like your parents when you (95:28 - 95:33)
were a child being like go outside and (95:30 - 95:34)
play (95:33 - 95:37)
go do that and then you can when you (95:34 - 95:39)
come back you can do whatever you want (95:37 - 95:41)
but just get some fresh air (95:39 - 95:44)
make some friends (95:41 - 95:48)
you know rip your jeans playing tag and (95:44 - 95:50)
then come back (95:48 - 95:52)
um which their product they have every (95:50 - 95:54)
right to say like (95:52 - 95:57)
you you we want you to do this this is (95:54 - 95:59)
how we want you to to do that oh you (95:57 - 96:02)
mean game freak I thought like (95:59 - 96:02)

gonna get into some deep parenting at (96:08 - 96:12)
this point yeah not the game freak not (96:10 - 96:14)
the parenting we need to take a break (96:12 - 96:17)
well we'll take one more break here (96:14 - 96:19)
um and then uh (96:17 - 96:21)
I don't think we'll spend a lot of time (96:19 - 96:23)
on the ash stuff but we do have to talk (96:21 - 96:25)
about it and then um you know we'll wrap (96:23 - 96:27)
up the show so uh we will be right back (96:25 - 96:31)
and we are back from our break (96:27 - 96:32)
um (96:31 - 96:35)
I think we covered everything in regards (96:32 - 96:39)
to scarlet and violet uh also (96:35 - 96:41)
the only thing I'm seeing here is uh the (96:39 - 96:43)
the flying Pikachu (96:41 - 96:45)
uh you'll still be able to get that (96:43 - 96:47)
within the first like two months you (96:45 - 96:49)
don't need Nintendo online for that you (96:47 - 96:52)
don't need to pre-order the game (96:49 - 96:54)
um whether you get it the release of or (96:52 - 96:56)
for Christmas you'll just be able to go (96:54 - 96:58)
to mystery gift to redeem the flying (96:56 - 97:00)
Pikachu it is not a pre-order bonus it (96:58 - 97:03)
is just a I bought it before the (97:00 - 97:05)
allotted time a bonus (97:03 - 97:08)
early purchase early purchase is the way (97:05 - 97:11)
they describe that (97:08 - 97:12)
um (97:11 - 97:16)
okay uh so at uh four a.m a couple days (97:12 - 97:18)
ago I got a press release saying Ash (97:16 - 97:20)
Ketchum has become the world champion I (97:18 - 97:24)

I'm (97:36 - 97:39)
if if you don't want to hear us talk (97:40 - 97:44)
about this I guess skip through this uh (97:41 - 97:45)
I'm just gonna read the press release I (97:44 - 97:47)
didn't I I watched the match I don't (97:45 - 97:49)
know if we need to talk about the match (97:47 - 97:50)
but (97:49 - 97:52)
I think we need to talk more about like (97:50 - 97:55)
what this means for the future which I (97:52 - 97:57)
guess no one really knows has been (97:55 - 98:01)

um I don't taito (99:34 - 99:39)
okiara vice president of marketing for (99:36 - 99:42)
Pokemon company International quote we (99:39 - 99:43)
cannot wait to celebrate this moment (99:42 - 99:45)
with Pokemon fans when the newest season (99:43 - 99:47)
of Pokemon ultimate Journeys the series (99:45 - 99:51)
and and this adventure defining episode (99:47 - 99:53)
airs around the world in the coming year (99:51 - 99:57)
the season fans won't want to miss end (99:53 - 99:59)
quote also it says that this is (99:57 - 100:02)
exclusively to Netflix in the US (99:59 - 100:05)
um and yeah (100:02 - 100:06)
I think the Nintendo press release is (100:05 - 100:09)
ultimately the same thing (100:06 - 100:09)
I don't I don't have an issue with the (100:11 - 100:17)
the spoiling the thing in general why (100:13 - 100:20)
have the issue with uh is (100:17 - 100:23)
we don't we didn't have the ability to (100:20 - 100:24)
watch it (100:23 - 100:27)
before the spoiling now I totally (100:24 - 100:28)
understand why they've done it this way (100:27 - 100:31)
because like when when he when he won (100:28 - 100:33)
alola they didn't publish it on any (100:31 - 100:35)
English news things but it's still like (100:33 - 100:37)
we all know immediately right (100:35 - 100:40)
but I guess so I understand why the the (100:37 - 100:43)
dub takes a while to air (100:40 - 100:45)
um I don't understand why it takes more (100:43 - 100:47)
time to air here than it does in America (100:45 - 100:49)
it's the exact same thing but let's move (100:47 - 100:51)
that interestingly it hasn't for the (100:49 - 100:54)
most recent series we had all all the 12 (100:51 - 100:57)
episodes that are on us Netflix we had (100:54 - 100:58)
them before they went to the US this (100:57 - 101:00)
time the first time it's ever happened (100:58 - 101:03)
that I've noticed but anyway that aside (101:00 - 101:05)
I don't understand why they can't have (101:03 - 101:11)
some ability for fans who care to watch (101:05 - 101:13)
a subbed version of it (101:11 - 101:15)
even the day after and it launches in (101:13 - 101:16)
Japan doesn't have to be at the same (101:15 - 101:18)
time I get they'll probably have some (101:16 - 101:21)
exclusivity around the same day that's (101:18 - 101:23)
pretty standard but the day after like (101:21 - 101:26)
yeah I mean subbing would not be that (101:23 - 101:28)
big a deal (101:26 - 101:31)
the issue that I generally have with it (101:28 - 101:33)
and like a lot of people were upset that (101:31 - 101:34)
they got spoiled and I'm like well I (101:33 - 101:36)
mean you have to face the fact that (101:34 - 101:37)
there was no way that this was gonna (101:36 - 101:39)
stay under wraps yeah right like right (101:37 - 101:41)
they played it on giant TV screens (101:39 - 101:44)
outside in Japan like it was not gonna (101:41 - 101:46)
stay a secret the issue that I have (101:44 - 101:49)
around this is (101:46 - 101:54)
they don't prioritize localization at (101:49 - 101:57)
all because there are a ton of very (101:54 - 102:00)
popular anime series that have (101:57 - 102:05)
simulcasts that have Subs the day after (102:00 - 102:08)
that go up immediately to help solve (102:05 - 102:11)
this problem and it is a unique (102:08 - 102:13)
it's weird because they're like playing (102:11 - 102:14)
both sides of the fields because they're (102:13 - 102:18)
one saying it's not worth localizing it (102:14 - 102:20)
because it's just a kids show but you (102:18 - 102:22)
send a press release out to literally (102:20 - 102:25)
CNN and everybody else to say this is a (102:22 - 102:28)
major achievement and they're trying to (102:25 - 102:30)
have both coins both sides of the coin (102:28 - 102:32)
but I don't have the cake whatever you (102:30 - 102:33)
want whatever horrible metaphor you want (102:32 - 102:36)
they (102:33 - 102:36)
they kind of need to understand that the (102:36 - 102:42)
way they have a worldwide experience for (102:39 - 102:44)
their games should shift to having a (102:42 - 102:47)
worldwide experience for their anime (102:44 - 102:50)
and it bothers me that they treat the (102:47 - 102:53)
anime so poorly and I understand that (102:50 - 102:56)
it's not as popular (102:53 - 102:58)
as it is in Japan and the deals that (102:56 - 102:59)
they made are worse and they have to go (102:58 - 103:01)
through Netflix and these other third (102:59 - 103:03)
parties to get these on for whatever (103:01 - 103:05)
reasons like they've made some because (103:03 - 103:07)
they don't treat it like a valuable (103:05 - 103:09)
property I think they've made a lot of (103:07 - 103:12)
bad deals with who gets to show (103:09 - 103:14)
their stuff and (103:12 - 103:16)
again I don't mind spoilers I don't care (103:14 - 103:20)
that I know that he won it doesn't ruin (103:16 - 103:23)
my experience I just (103:20 - 103:25)
it annoys me that we will know this and (103:23 - 103:29)
it will be probably a year before we get (103:25 - 103:30)
to watch it because they don't (103:29 - 103:32)
prioritize localization no we're (103:30 - 103:34)
supposed to get at the end of the year (103:32 - 103:36)
by before the end of the year have they (103:34 - 103:38)
said that for sure yeah (103:36 - 103:41)
it said uh notices in the coming (103:38 - 103:45)
year that's in the coming years so far (103:41 - 103:47)
it has been certainly in America it has (103:45 - 103:51)
been uh 12 episodes every three months (103:47 - 103:55)
and so we have still at least 40 (103:51 - 103:58)
episodes to go (103:55 - 103:58)
very soon but yeah I don't think it'll (103:58 - 104:03)
be the the rest of them (104:01 - 104:07)
there are 30 episodes all right so (104:03 - 104:09)
that's more than two batches (104:07 - 104:14)
um yeah I mean like the (104:09 - 104:16)
it's the spoiler stuff is kind of like (104:14 - 104:18)
when you saw the Masters eight for the (104:16 - 104:20)
first time and you saw Cynthia and Iris (104:18 - 104:24)
and Leon and Ash like there there's no (104:20 - 104:26)
secret it's Ash and Leon are the finals (104:24 - 104:28)
like like (104:26 - 104:31)
to say like oh I wonder who's going to (104:28 - 104:33)
like be who's going to beat who it's (104:31 - 104:35)
like well it's going to be Ash and Leon (104:33 - 104:37)
like it like this you say that you say (104:35 - 104:39)
that but they've not always done it that (104:37 - 104:41)
way this is not being the standard thing (104:39 - 104:43)
like I think that would have been the (104:41 - 104:44)
main thing that made most sense for this (104:43 - 104:46)
series based on clearly they want him to (104:44 - 104:48)
have progression now they've clearly (104:46 - 104:51)
been improving him over the time but (104:48 - 104:53)
like until alola you couldn't even (104:51 - 104:55)
guarantee he was being gonna be in the (104:53 - 104:58)
final right well I would maybe say X and (104:55 - 105:00)
Y (104:58 - 105:02)
X X and Y he was in the final but were (105:00 - 105:04)
you convinced when you were what like (105:02 - 105:05)
before that happened that it was (105:04 - 105:07)
definitely gonna happen (105:05 - 105:10)
uh that I I can't I I don't know of I I (105:07 - 105:13)
was I was surprised that Ash got knocked (105:10 - 105:16)
out so early in black and white (105:13 - 105:16)
um well (105:16 - 105:19)
but but (105:19 - 105:23)
I watched a lot of black and white I (105:20 - 105:25)
didn't watch a lot of exercise (105:23 - 105:28)
teaser trailers like you can you can at (105:25 - 105:30)
least sort of say hey (105:28 - 105:32)
this is probably the most likely outcome (105:30 - 105:34)
but they could still surprise me like (105:32 - 105:35)
that's the whole point of a teaser (105:34 - 105:39)
poster like yeah is misdirection hinting (105:35 - 105:41)
let you let you speculate (105:39 - 105:43)
um this is a very different thing and (105:41 - 105:45)
like I don't again (105:43 - 105:47)
it's a thing that happened they couldn't (105:45 - 105:50)
keep it under their hats it's spoiled (105:47 - 105:53)
because it actually happened I just wish (105:50 - 105:57)
they decided to make the anime a (105:53 - 105:59)
worldwide experience like they do their (105:57 - 106:01)
games well okay with the spoiler stuff (105:59 - 106:04)
we should be pretty clear here (106:01 - 106:09)
um with in the sense of alola when Ash (106:04 - 106:13)
won alola the English Twitter tweeted (106:09 - 106:16)
I just did like an image of like uh like (106:13 - 106:19)
ash right there it would they didn't (106:16 - 106:21)
publicly say Ash one they didn't (106:19 - 106:24)
acknowledge it but (106:21 - 106:26)
not only did (106:24 - 106:30)
polygon Kotaku bubble P like like gaming (106:26 - 106:33)
websites pick it up and and quote (106:30 - 106:37)
unquote spoil it but mainstream media (106:33 - 106:40)
did when Ash went alola yeah that was on (106:37 - 106:42)
espn.com (106:40 - 106:46)
like espn.com covered Ash winning alola (106:42 - 106:49)
and I think that was the turning point (106:46 - 106:52)
of them saying well we're we're leading (106:49 - 106:55)
to Ash having a bigger victory (106:52 - 106:58)
he's he's finally going to achieve the (106:55 - 107:00)
one thing he was going for I mean a lot (106:58 - 107:01)
of people would argue that him winning (107:00 - 107:03)
alola was uh was kind of him achieving (107:01 - 107:07)
that in a sense but I mean if you look (107:03 - 107:13)
at any sport when the New York Giants (107:07 - 107:15)
win is that a that's a baseball team I (107:13 - 107:17)
think when when when they win they don't (107:15 - 107:21)
go like okay we won no they they want to (107:17 - 107:25)
win again right they like they won yeah (107:21 - 107:27)
having said that they do say in this (107:25 - 107:30)
press release that he has achieved his (107:27 - 107:33)
goal and his goal was he has always (107:30 - 107:35)
stated his goal and they've been stating (107:33 - 107:37)
this throughout Journeys his goal is to (107:35 - 107:40)
become a Pokemon master and that's not (107:37 - 107:42)
that's not his goal is to win a specific (107:40 - 107:44)
Championship his his goal is to become a (107:42 - 107:46)
Pokemon Master that's not something (107:44 - 107:48)
becoming a Pokemon Master isn't (107:46 - 107:50)
something you do multiple times (107:48 - 107:54)
yeah I mean uh just to just to finish my (107:50 - 107:57)
point I I think they they knew that they (107:54 - 107:59)
had to say something because based on (107:57 - 108:01)
alola (107:59 - 108:03)
that this was going to be mainstream (108:01 - 108:04)
media so even if you're if you're the (108:03 - 108:06)
person on Twitter that's like I muted (108:04 - 108:08)
Pokemon for the week I muted shiny I (108:06 - 108:11)
muted scarlet and violet I muted all of (108:08 - 108:14)
these things (108:11 - 108:14)
mainstream media is still probably going (108:14 - 108:19)
to push in somewhere in your life where (108:16 - 108:21)
you're going to hear that Ash one so (108:19 - 108:23)
like instead of what they did (108:21 - 108:25)
two years ago or whatever (108:23 - 108:27)
when he won three years ago or whatever (108:25 - 108:29)
when he won alola they were like you (108:27 - 108:30)
know what we're going to use this to our (108:29 - 108:34)
advantage and we're just going to also (108:30 - 108:37)
just let everyone know that he won (108:34 - 108:39)
um which you know they're what a (108:37 - 108:41)
coincidence a brand new game is coming (108:39 - 108:42)
out next week and they can use that to (108:41 - 108:45)
their advantage marketing wise (108:42 - 108:47)
um I mean there is no secret that the (108:45 - 108:49)
anime (108:47 - 108:53)
is a huge propeller (108:49 - 108:57)
as a huge Force to selling merchandise (108:53 - 109:00)
and games and their card stuff like like (108:57 - 109:02)
you could argue that the anime is a 23 (109:00 - 109:04)
minute commercial every week (109:02 - 109:07)
we've seen the numbers over 60 percent (109:04 - 109:10)
of all of the money they make is from (109:07 - 109:12)
merchandise (109:10 - 109:15)
um so (109:12 - 109:18)
you know again they they kind of knew (109:15 - 109:19)
that this couldn't be kept a secret (109:18 - 109:24)
because it would hit espn.com again uh (109:19 - 109:27)
but like I guess the question is like (109:24 - 109:29)
where do they go from here now right do (109:27 - 109:31)
they well this is this is the thing I (109:29 - 109:34)
think the argument isn't they have they (109:31 - 109:35)
couldn't say anything I think the (109:34 - 109:36)
argument is they need to be able to deal (109:35 - 109:39)
with that better in the future yeah well (109:36 - 109:42)
my hope is that they realized it was an (109:39 - 109:44)
issue after the alola one but the deals (109:42 - 109:45)
for the next series were already in (109:44 - 109:47)
place they couldn't do anything about (109:45 - 109:49)
that so I'm really hoping that they've (109:47 - 109:51)
sorted that for the next series coming (109:49 - 109:53)
and they will have something like you (109:51 - 109:56)
say Greg with with with this yeah it's (109:53 - 109:58)
really weird for a show that is really (109:56 - 110:01)
an advertisement for the new games that (109:58 - 110:02)
we don't get the new series until the (110:01 - 110:06)
games have been out for months here like (110:02 - 110:08)
they don't localize it so that we are (110:06 - 110:11)
getting the scarlet and violet series (110:08 - 110:13)
when Scarlet Violet launches worldwide (110:11 - 110:16)
it has always struck me like why have (110:13 - 110:18)
you not (110:16 - 110:20)
tried to get those aligned and I do (110:18 - 110:22)
think it just speaks to the fact that (110:20 - 110:24)
they don't (110:22 - 110:27)
put a lot of thought or care into the (110:24 - 110:30)
anime as far as how it's marketed they (110:27 - 110:32)
still treat it as a kid's vehicle (110:30 - 110:33)
I mean I feel like they never did look (110:32 - 110:37)
at all anime it was some of the worst (110:33 - 110:39)
animated produced anime out there (110:37 - 110:42)
because they cut costs yeah I mean (110:39 - 110:45)
there's like animation's expensive you (110:42 - 110:47)
can look at you can look at current (110:45 - 110:49)
popular animes that have vastly (110:47 - 110:51)
different qualities because of how they (110:49 - 110:53)
run their anime house like it's a (110:51 - 110:56)
complicated equation (110:53 - 110:58)
um but (110:56 - 111:00)
there's now this thing where like you (110:58 - 111:02)
know this is worldwide news and you know (111:00 - 111:03)
this is a good advertisement for your (111:02 - 111:06)
game but you still won't take (111:03 - 111:09)
this thing and make it a localization (111:06 - 111:11)
you won't make it a worldwide experience (111:09 - 111:13)
and I it it it bothers me is what it (111:11 - 111:14)
does (111:13 - 111:19)
yeah I so so the the question (111:14 - 111:22)
is (111:19 - 111:22)
they're they're not stopping the anime (111:22 - 111:26)
no (111:25 - 111:30)
uh that that's very clear (111:26 - 111:33)
um the question is (111:30 - 111:34)
what (111:33 - 111:36)
what happens (111:34 - 111:40)
do do do they take a character that is (111:36 - 111:43)
undoubtedly no one could argue you could (111:40 - 111:46)
say that the Pokemon anime is complete (111:43 - 111:48)
trash and you absolutely hate it and Ash (111:46 - 111:50)
is a bad character that is a valid (111:48 - 111:52)
opinion you're allowed to have but the (111:50 - 111:55)
facts are that Ash is one of the most (111:52 - 111:58)
recognizable standout anime characters (111:55 - 112:00)
in the world (111:58 - 112:03)
hands down (112:00 - 112:05)
um that people who don't (112:03 - 112:09)
no more than two Pokemon's names know (112:05 - 112:11)
that when they see Ash that is the (112:09 - 112:13)
Pokemon guy (112:11 - 112:16)
so do you that hey is that Pokemon guy (112:13 - 112:20)
so they they have experimented (112:16 - 112:23)
and have done semi-soft reboots in the (112:20 - 112:25)
anime with like black and white they (112:23 - 112:27)
also did technically a semi-soft reboot (112:25 - 112:30)
of the black and white games uh (112:27 - 112:32)
obviously they that didn't really work (112:30 - 112:34)
out maybe the way they wanted it to so (112:32 - 112:36)
they'll never acknowledge that that was (112:34 - 112:39)
like kind of a soft reboot it didn't it (112:36 - 112:41)
to me it they kind of wanted to do it (112:39 - 112:42)
with black and white but they they they (112:41 - 112:45)
didn't fully commit there (112:42 - 112:49)
um you know the journeys opened up with (112:45 - 112:52)
uh you know Ash's room and you saw his (112:49 - 112:55)
you saw his orange island trophy you saw (112:52 - 112:59)
his alola trophy you saw his runner-up (112:55 - 113:02)
trophies so for whatever reason Pokemon (112:59 - 113:05)
fans like to argue that every season is (113:02 - 113:07)
a reboot people like to bring up that (113:05 - 113:10)
that Pikachu lost to Snivy time and time (113:07 - 113:13)
again like that was explained in the (113:10 - 113:16)
anime (113:13 - 113:16)
it literally needs to explain very (113:16 - 113:21)
clearly well explained that there's a (113:19 - 113:23)
reason why Pikachu lost the Snivy yes (113:21 - 113:24)
Pikachu is a much higher level than (113:23 - 113:26)
Snivy but there was a reason in that (113:24 - 113:28)
episode that they clearly explained why (113:26 - 113:31)
he lost anyways (113:28 - 113:32)
um (113:31 - 113:36)
but like the TCG weird comparison I know (113:32 - 113:38)
it'll make sense there has been an (113:36 - 113:41)
obvious power creep in Ash's ability and (113:38 - 113:43)
and Pikachu (113:41 - 113:44)
like (113:43 - 113:46)
Pikachu lost the Snivy in black and (113:44 - 113:48)
white for a very clear-cut reason (113:46 - 113:51)
because of Zekrom uh and Pikachu has (113:48 - 113:54)
been getting stronger every single (113:51 - 113:57)
season I would argue since black and (113:54 - 113:59)
white is really where that soft reboot (113:57 - 114:01)
did kind of seem like okay Pikachu kind (113:59 - 114:03)
of has to like relearn and kind of get (114:01 - 114:05)
stronger again (114:03 - 114:05)
um (114:05 - 114:07)
and even one of the most fun things (114:05 - 114:10)
about alola was Pikachu would almost (114:07 - 114:13)
always lose to mimikyu but then (114:10 - 114:15)
something broke up that battle so you (114:13 - 114:17)
never actually knew how strong mimikyu (114:15 - 114:19)
was you never knew how strong Pikachu (114:17 - 114:21)
was because someone always interfered (114:19 - 114:23)
but it did seem like mimikyu had the (114:21 - 114:25)
advantage every single time (114:23 - 114:26)
um (114:25 - 114:29)
so do they do they start season 26 with (114:26 - 114:31)
Ash (114:29 - 114:35)
and Pikachu and we have a true soft we (114:31 - 114:38)
do we have a true reboot or they can (114:35 - 114:40)
just do the thing where Ash wants to (114:38 - 114:42)
pursue another championship and that is (114:40 - 114:45)
totally fine and valid again when a when (114:42 - 114:48)
a team wins a Super Bowl or a World Cup (114:45 - 114:50)
they don't suddenly go we don't need to (114:48 - 114:53)
win another one like there are like like (114:50 - 114:57)
when wolf Glick won the 2017 (114:53 - 115:00)
2019 2019 World Championships he didn't (114:57 - 115:01)
go (115:00 - 115:04)
I don't need to win next year's worlds I (115:01 - 115:06)
mean to be fair some people do (115:04 - 115:08)
right there are plenty of people like (115:06 - 115:10)
you I achieved this one goal and now I (115:08 - 115:11)
don't need to do it again do I think (115:10 - 115:13)
they're going to get rid of Ash no do I (115:11 - 115:16)
think Ash will suddenly after a year of (115:13 - 115:18)
exploring the world everybody's like oh (115:16 - 115:20)
there's a region called paldea because (115:18 - 115:21)
apparently we don't have a world map (115:20 - 115:23)
sure let's go there for the first time (115:21 - 115:25)
literally ever because it's never been (115:23 - 115:28)
brought up before (115:25 - 115:30)
um I think they'll go there and there'll (115:28 - 115:31)
be a plot line and he'll be like heck (115:30 - 115:33)
yeah I'll do Jim's here because I've (115:31 - 115:34)
never fought these people like he's (115:33 - 115:37)
never fought Titans like there's there's (115:34 - 115:39)
a million like they're not gonna get rid (115:37 - 115:42)
of Ash right and Ash's motivations and (115:39 - 115:44)
just because he achieved one thing and (115:42 - 115:47)
he may decide they may say like we're (115:44 - 115:49)
gonna make him a mentor role now we're (115:47 - 115:51)
gonna age him slightly and he's going to (115:49 - 115:55)
be uh leading somebody else on their (115:51 - 115:57)
journey in hopes to have them be (115:55 - 115:59)
powerful enough to take me down like (115:57 - 116:00)
there's a million ways you can write (115:59 - 116:02)
that story we don't know but if you're (116:00 - 116:04)
thinking they're dumping Ash they're not (116:02 - 116:06)
dumping Ash (116:04 - 116:09)
I agree but I also want to say something (116:06 - 116:11)
can people stop saying Ash is 10 he is (116:09 - 116:15)
not 10 he is explicitly in the anime had (116:11 - 116:16)
a birthday or not had a birthday but (116:15 - 116:19)
celebrated the one year anniversary of (116:16 - 116:22)
when him and Pikachu met they explicitly (116:19 - 116:24)
say that he is at least 11. we don't (116:22 - 116:26)
have confirmation that he's any older (116:24 - 116:28)
than that but he is at least a living (116:26 - 116:30)
stop calling him 10. I thought I thought (116:28 - 116:32)
they I thought they confirmed he was 11 (116:30 - 116:34)
in alola I thought that was like yeah I (116:32 - 116:35)
think they confirmed he was 11 and alola (116:34 - 116:37)
I thought they I thought they confirmed (116:35 - 116:39)
that I can't remember I can't remember (116:37 - 116:40)
because there was something about he is (116:39 - 116:43)
at least 11. he's still having to be a (116:40 - 116:45)
certain age here's the other two things (116:43 - 116:48)
that annoyed me I had to listen to the (116:45 - 116:51)
the past year about how a new Eevee was (116:48 - 116:53)
going to be introduced because of Chloe (116:51 - 116:56)
that never happened you know we started (116:53 - 116:59)
off this podcast saying Charizard haters (116:56 - 117:00)
are the worst (116:59 - 117:03)
Evie Evie lovers are the worst they (117:00 - 117:04)
always think a new Evie is coming I'm (117:03 - 117:06)
like there was there was no indication (117:04 - 117:08)
that I will say you know what they've (117:06 - 117:10)
done the media has nothing to Ash (117:08 - 117:12)
ketchum's age (117:10 - 117:14)
to pass ten (117:12 - 117:16)
oh for goodness sake I will say that I I (117:14 - 117:18)
agree right obviously there's not (117:16 - 117:20)
another Evie coming but what I will say (117:18 - 117:22)
is I wouldn't be surprised if they used (117:20 - 117:26)
this Eevee to talk about Terror types (117:22 - 117:28)
I'd be you know I I thought for the (117:26 - 117:30)
longest time that Chloe the reason they (117:28 - 117:33)
didn't evolve it is because Evie has a (117:30 - 117:35)
gigantomax form the evolutions do not (117:33 - 117:37)
yeah yeah (117:35 - 117:40)
um but yeah the the constant for the (117:37 - 117:42)
past year and a half of like well Evie's (117:40 - 117:46)
Chloe hasn't evolved like yeah Chloe (117:42 - 117:48)
can't even make a decision what she (117:46 - 117:49)
wants for breakfast you think she's (117:48 - 117:50)
going to be able to figure out what (117:49 - 117:54)
Eevee she wants like well the point is (117:50 - 117:56)
the eve the Eevee easy doesn't want to (117:54 - 117:58)
evolve like that's kind of the point (117:56 - 118:02)
it's not a cant it chooses not to the (117:58 - 118:04)
the other thing is (118:02 - 118:07)
for the last two years (118:04 - 118:09)
um (118:07 - 118:09)
a break a break a break here this is (118:09 - 118:15)
Wild on the (118:13 - 118:18)
official Japanese website for Journeys (118:15 - 118:22)
uh-huh they have Ash listed a 10 year (118:18 - 118:24)
old boy (118:22 - 118:26)
still (118:24 - 118:28)
I mean that none of that stuff surprises (118:26 - 118:30)
me because like The Simpsons exists I (118:28 - 118:32)
know but like Bart has had like seven (118:30 - 118:34)
birthdays but like they have (118:32 - 118:36)
specifically stated the anime that his (118:34 - 118:38)
age has changed but on their official (118:36 - 118:40)
website they are still saying is a 10 (118:38 - 118:43)
year old child it's just I'm just (118:40 - 118:44)
pointing that out like they aren't (118:43 - 118:47)
consistent (118:44 - 118:47)
I I the people who hang on to Ash's age (118:47 - 118:52)
is is really (118:51 - 118:55)
silly to me because like they it's (118:52 - 118:56)
almost like well if he gets older it (118:55 - 118:58)
will get better his age is so irrelevant (118:56 - 119:01)
in the in like his age get older he's (118:58 - 119:03)
never getting smarter like (119:01 - 119:05)
I don't want him to get that older (119:03 - 119:07)
because he will get into the Moody (119:05 - 119:08)
teenager State you don't want the Moody (119:07 - 119:11)
teenager have you watched any of the uh (119:08 - 119:12)
Harry Potter like Harry Potter's already (119:11 - 119:14)
unbearable at this point but like Harry (119:12 - 119:17)
did not become a better character when (119:14 - 119:20)
he got older he got super moody which to (119:17 - 119:21)
be fair maybe that's the one thing JK (119:20 - 119:22)
Rowling got right she got a lot wrong (119:21 - 119:24)
but (119:22 - 119:28)
a teenager is unbearable to read about (119:24 - 119:32)
like I I I've been there I don't anyways (119:28 - 119:34)
anyways for the last three years (119:32 - 119:37)
we had to hear about how the main reason (119:34 - 119:42)
go got introduced was to take over Ash's (119:37 - 119:45)
job which I don't know where that theory (119:42 - 119:47)
or anything came from I have actually (119:45 - 119:48)
heard that theory now it looked at them (119:47 - 119:50)
unusual at that point too because why (119:48 - 119:52)
would you get rid of your main character (119:50 - 119:55)
the the literal the the face of most of (119:52 - 119:57)
your marketing so so here's here's the (119:55 - 119:58)
thing (119:57 - 120:01)
sometimes people ask for something (119:58 - 120:03)
and then they get it and they realize (120:01 - 120:05)
that's not actually what they wanted (120:03 - 120:07)
even though they they got exactly what (120:05 - 120:10)
they asked for I was this way I will (120:07 - 120:13)
here we go I'll admit I was wrong as as (120:10 - 120:15)
a child as a 10 year old boy watching (120:13 - 120:18)
the Pokemon anime and while watching (120:15 - 120:20)
almost every single season of the anime (120:18 - 120:24)
I thought to myself it frustrates me so (120:20 - 120:27)
much that Ash doesn't catch Pokemon now (120:24 - 120:29)
Ash does catch Pokemon he really wants (120:27 - 120:32)
or in this case a lot of cases the (120:29 - 120:33)
Pokemon wants to join his team because (120:32 - 120:35)
he's caring or whatever so he doesn't (120:33 - 120:37)
actually catch them (120:35 - 120:39)
um and it always bothered me and I (120:37 - 120:40)
thought to myself and there was there (120:39 - 120:43)
was a specific episode in alola where (120:40 - 120:45)
Ash finds an alolan Geo dude and he (120:43 - 120:46)
tries to catch it and he actually fails (120:45 - 120:48)
and like that episode is like really (120:46 - 120:51)
kind of fun because he tries to catch a (120:48 - 120:53)
Pokemon and he actually fails at it and (120:51 - 120:54)
I'm like man I wish they would do this (120:53 - 120:56)
more often because like even though he (120:54 - 120:59)
didn't catch it it was fun to watch him (120:56 - 121:01)
fail that catch and then they entered (120:59 - 121:05)
use a character called go and I think go (121:01 - 121:08)
is a great character I I but I also (121:05 - 121:10)
think go is a great character because he (121:08 - 121:13)
is the opposite of Ash go is very (121:10 - 121:15)
logical Ash is very emotional they have (121:13 - 121:18)
really good chemistry together and Ash (121:15 - 121:20)
cares about battling go catches about (121:18 - 121:23)
catching what I wanted as a kid was to (121:20 - 121:26)
see Ash catch more Pokemon because I (121:23 - 121:30)
thought that would be interesting and (121:26 - 121:32)
after watching C episode after episode (121:30 - 121:35)
of go catching Pokemon they have been (121:32 - 121:38)
right for 25 years it is not fun to (121:35 - 121:42)
watch it is inherently boring and maybe (121:38 - 121:44)
it's because they made like go catch (121:42 - 121:46)
Pokemon so easy but it's not a (121:44 - 121:49)
particularly interesting anime Trope it (121:46 - 121:53)
like go on his own one is not a (121:49 - 121:55)
compelling enough character two it kind (121:53 - 121:56)
of made sense why they didn't make Ash (121:55 - 121:58)
catch a bunch of Pokemon because it's (121:56 - 122:02)
not great it's not here's the thing fun (121:58 - 122:05)
to watch it's like okay but it it it the (122:02 - 122:09)
reason why it's not great is is because (122:05 - 122:12)
go doesn't have a reason to bond very (122:09 - 122:14)
much with specific Pokemon right like (122:12 - 122:17)
the thing that you like in Ash and his (122:14 - 122:19)
teams and limiting is you get to know (122:17 - 122:21)
the personalities of these Pokemon (122:19 - 122:23)
except for Turtwig which they just (122:21 - 122:25)
really did Dirty that entire season (122:23 - 122:27)
they're like and then Turtwig exists (122:25 - 122:29)
it's just gonna be there nobody likes (122:27 - 122:33)
you the thing that but like Ash works (122:29 - 122:36)
great with other characters because Ash (122:33 - 122:38)
is a foil right like you need a foil (122:36 - 122:42)
against things and go is a really really (122:38 - 122:46)
good foil for ash goat doesn't do well (122:42 - 122:48)
on his own just like Misty doesn't do (122:46 - 122:49)
particularly great on her own because (122:48 - 122:51)
the only thing she ever they ever had to (122:49 - 122:53)
do is be angry at Ash all the time right (122:51 - 122:54)
like there's not a lot of (122:53 - 122:57)
characterization there until they split (122:54 - 122:58)
them off and then say they have the (122:57 - 123:01)
spectacular life when they come back in (122:58 - 123:04)
Ash exists as a foil for certain things (123:01 - 123:06)
and the people that they put with them (123:04 - 123:08)
are more effective or less effective as (123:06 - 123:10)
foils Like You could argue that Serena (123:08 - 123:13)
is and done aren't particularly great (123:10 - 123:16)
foils because they're just as impulsive (123:13 - 123:19)
sometimes whereas go is a good foil to (123:16 - 123:21)
shine the light on (123:19 - 123:24)
here is Ash's philosophy but here's also (123:21 - 123:27)
the flaws with Ash's philosophy because (123:24 - 123:30)
you have a direct opposite you have its (123:27 - 123:32)
foil and neither one of them can stand (123:30 - 123:35)
very well on their own go is a boring (123:32 - 123:38)
character without something to struggle (123:35 - 123:39)
against (123:38 - 123:42)
and since ghost thing isn't building a (123:39 - 123:45)
team it is just collecting you don't get (123:42 - 123:48)
the joy of knowing his Pokemon except (123:45 - 123:50)
for the two that he always carries with (123:48 - 123:52)
him which is cinderius and grookie (123:50 - 123:55)
yeah I think so I think it's pretty (123:52 - 123:57)
clear right like the goal is not going (123:55 - 123:58)
to continue past this series right he's (123:57 - 124:00)
going to join project Mew and yeah oh (123:58 - 124:03)
the the episode they introduced project (124:00 - 124:05)
Mew it was like you have written the you (124:03 - 124:08)
have started the ending for go yeah they (124:05 - 124:09)
literally they have an episode in the (124:08 - 124:11)
list of upcoming episodes called project (124:09 - 124:13)
Mew that's clearly going to be the one (124:11 - 124:15)
where he really gets in right (124:13 - 124:18)
um but what I will find interesting is (124:15 - 124:19)
so obviously it'll be interesting to see (124:18 - 124:21)
whether they learn from from that and (124:19 - 124:23)
have some some good characters in the (124:21 - 124:25)
next season what I wonder is are they (124:23 - 124:27)
going to go back to what they did before (124:25 - 124:30)
which was Ash and companions traveling (124:27 - 124:33)
through a region or like what Journeys (124:30 - 124:35)
has been which is (124:33 - 124:38)
whatever this is beaten you know like (124:35 - 124:40)
that will just suddenly be in alola will (124:38 - 124:42)
just suddenly be in hohen oh no now (124:40 - 124:45)
we're back in Kanto um (124:42 - 124:48)
I think from a storytelling (124:45 - 124:50)
perspective (124:48 - 124:53)
it is more interesting for them to tell (124:50 - 124:55)
stories throughout the entire world at (124:53 - 124:58)
this point than focusing on one region (124:55 - 125:00)
but (124:58 - 125:02)
it also (125:00 - 125:05)
as a watcher I felt like (125:02 - 125:08)
but Gala doesn't really exist (125:05 - 125:11)
right like it is just another thing that (125:08 - 125:13)
is there that they go to sometimes and (125:11 - 125:16)
they really don't ever fully explore (125:13 - 125:19)
unless it's a very special episode I (125:16 - 125:21)
will say from like a writer's (125:19 - 125:25)
perspective it is way more (125:21 - 125:28)
simple to be like we're going to write a (125:25 - 125:30)
plot line that can only exist in this (125:28 - 125:32)
region and it makes sense in this region (125:30 - 125:34)
and we can do a bunch of Filler episodes (125:32 - 125:36)
in Johto for a while because we are (125:34 - 125:38)
literally out of things to talk about in (125:36 - 125:40)
scarlet and violet until (125:38 - 125:42)
something I think I think on the premise (125:40 - 125:45)
the like like it just seems like scarlet (125:42 - 125:47)
and violet (125:45 - 125:49)
are such bigger games than sword and (125:47 - 125:51)
shield ever were presented (125:49 - 125:53)
sword and shield was like this is our (125:51 - 125:56)
first big brand new game on switch we (125:53 - 125:59)
got a lot to learn it was very linear (125:56 - 126:01)
like like I I'm never gonna say that (125:59 - 126:04)
that game wasn't linear it was it's fine (126:01 - 126:06)
I was okay I'm okay with linear games (126:04 - 126:07)
personally (126:06 - 126:10)
um the wild area was something new but (126:07 - 126:12)
in this instance of scarlet and violet (126:10 - 126:15)
they were like you got team star you got (126:12 - 126:17)
the gym leader stuff which apparently (126:15 - 126:19)
there are multiple Champions you got all (126:17 - 126:21)
the Titan stuff you got the giant (126:19 - 126:23)
mystery in the center you got big old (126:21 - 126:26)
Primal Dawn fan you have so many (126:23 - 126:28)
directions where it felt like we can do (126:26 - 126:30)
a lot in this region where Galler was (126:28 - 126:33)
well do we want Ash going from this city (126:30 - 126:35)
to the city to the city and then like (126:33 - 126:37)
what do we do like it kind of like it (126:35 - 126:39)
almost and that's not to say sword and (126:37 - 126:41)
shield are bad but it felt like there (126:39 - 126:43)
was a (126:41 - 126:45)
I don't know there like there was a (126:43 - 126:47)
disconnect there like we don't we want (126:45 - 126:50)
something bigger and they Galler cannot (126:47 - 126:51)
do that bigger thing we want they've (126:50 - 126:54)
never really followed directly the (126:51 - 126:56)
linear path of the games like there's a (126:54 - 126:58)
bunch of cities that exist in the anime (126:56 - 127:01)
that are not in those games (126:58 - 127:03)
um so like to say like (127:01 - 127:05)
what would they do in a Gala region they (127:03 - 127:06)
would add a bunch of towns like they did (127:05 - 127:09)
in every region like Welcome To Dark (127:06 - 127:10)
City like they've done a bunch of weird (127:09 - 127:11)
things where these towns you're like (127:10 - 127:14)
where are you and what route are you on (127:11 - 127:16)
you're in a mountainous area that (127:14 - 127:19)
doesn't exist they could do it yeah (127:16 - 127:22)
um the question is again (127:19 - 127:24)
since we don't really know the the (127:22 - 127:27)
actual plot line of scarlet and violet (127:24 - 127:29)
yet it's hard to predict what their (127:27 - 127:32)
plotline of (127:29 - 127:32)
of the anime will be and how much (127:32 - 127:37)
they're going to keep it the standard (127:35 - 127:41)
the standard plot line because like the (127:37 - 127:43)
star stuff just sounds like a one-off (127:41 - 127:45)
episode right like team star oh I don't (127:43 - 127:48)
think so I don't think so at all the I (127:45 - 127:50)
think I think from what I've experienced (127:48 - 127:51)
from what I played personally not (127:50 - 127:54)
looking at spoilers the second I battled (127:51 - 127:56)
Mella and everything to follow which (127:54 - 127:59)
Nintendo was like do not say anything (127:56 - 128:00)
about your battle with Mella like you (127:59 - 128:02)
can say you battled Mella the star stuff (128:00 - 128:05)
was was the most interesting story stuff (128:02 - 128:07)
I've seen the last 10 years of Pokemon (128:05 - 128:10)
hands down I was like I need to know (128:07 - 128:13)
more after about like yeah they don't (128:10 - 128:14)
they what I'm saying is they don't tend (128:13 - 128:16)
to take that into the anime (128:14 - 128:19)
they went really hard on team flare in (128:16 - 128:21)
in X and Y for whatever reason and team (128:19 - 128:24)
flare was a disaster in the games it was (128:21 - 128:26)
so bad (128:24 - 128:29)
um not to say that if like (128:26 - 128:31)
the anime team player if they moved in (128:29 - 128:33)
the games it would be better because I (128:31 - 128:34)
don't think they knew what they were (128:33 - 128:35)
doing to team flare until they got to (128:34 - 128:37)
the anime (128:35 - 128:39)
um but they they went very heavy (128:37 - 128:41)
on team flare I mean like they didn't (128:39 - 128:43)
really do anything with Team skull I (128:41 - 128:46)
mean they did but not like you know (128:43 - 128:47)
um they didn't really do anything with (128:46 - 128:50)
uh Team yell I couldn't even remember (128:47 - 128:52)
their team but again those two teams (128:50 - 128:55)
didn't feel even in the games they felt (128:52 - 128:58)
blah like they're they're not I don't (128:55 - 128:59)
think they're bad teams I think they're (128:58 - 129:01)
fun in whatever (128:59 - 129:03)
stereotypes they want to put them into (129:01 - 129:06)
but like they they didn't they didn't (129:03 - 129:09)
translate to a uh a start to finish (129:06 - 129:13)
story they they they hit story beats but (129:09 - 129:15)
they like no one saw team skull and was (129:13 - 129:18)
like I wonder how this dramatic story (129:15 - 129:20)
with them ended it was just like oh well (129:18 - 129:22)
team skull's here again to like throw a (129:20 - 129:24)
wrench in the machine and like yeah but (129:22 - 129:27)
I mean the leader of of (129:24 - 129:29)
team skull did have a lot to do at the (129:27 - 129:31)
end of that game like there was a pretty (129:29 - 129:35)
big a whole bunch of stuff that that (129:31 - 129:37)
guzma was doing with Lucy mean like (129:35 - 129:39)
there's a lot that happened in those (129:37 - 129:42)
games with that the grunts no the people (129:39 - 129:45)
up top absolutely yeah I don't think (129:42 - 129:48)
people connected the way that (129:45 - 129:51)
they they should have I guess I (129:48 - 129:54)
shouldn't say should have like I liked (129:51 - 129:56)
what they were doing with guzma I liked (129:54 - 129:57)
what they were doing with Lucy mean but (129:56 - 130:00)
if you ask the average person who played (129:57 - 130:02)
sun and moon what that game was about I (130:00 - 130:04)
would argue that most people would not (130:02 - 130:07)
bring up that game had to do with abuse (130:04 - 130:10)
between adults and children yeah I would (130:07 - 130:12)
I would argue most people didn't see (130:10 - 130:14)
that that was the story they were trying (130:12 - 130:16)
to tell I mean you when you (130:14 - 130:20)
the number of people have have said time (130:16 - 130:22)
and time again like there's a majority (130:20 - 130:24)
of people who are like sun and moon is (130:22 - 130:25)
the better story because of these (130:24 - 130:28)
reasons but again the what happened in (130:25 - 130:31)
Sun and Moon they backed way off for the (130:28 - 130:33)
enemy none of that was in the anime (130:31 - 130:36)
Lucid was a very different mom in the (130:33 - 130:37)
anime that she was in those games so (130:36 - 130:39)
it's really hard to say (130:37 - 130:41)
what they're going to take and what (130:39 - 130:43)
they're going to put in the games and (130:41 - 130:44)
what they're going to keep in the anime (130:43 - 130:47)
so who knows what they're gonna do I (130:44 - 130:50)
think it is more interesting for them to (130:47 - 130:54)
keep the world an open world as in all (130:50 - 130:56)
regions than to tightly focus it into (130:54 - 130:59)
just scarlet and violet oh I agree (130:56 - 131:01)
but but who knows if they're gonna do (130:59 - 131:02)
that (131:01 - 131:05)
but I do agree here's the thing I I will (131:02 - 131:08)
say to wrap this up (131:05 - 131:08)
in (131:08 - 131:13)
the episodes that they showed so far you (131:09 - 131:15)
can see a brand new legendary for (131:13 - 131:19)
scarlet and violet in one of the posters (131:15 - 131:22)
uh which is obviously where ash would be (131:19 - 131:24)
going next would be to paldea (131:22 - 131:27)
right so (131:24 - 131:30)
if if there's anything if there's (131:27 - 131:33)
anything that like would would signify (131:30 - 131:36)
if Ash is is continuing his journey (131:33 - 131:38)
here's here's here's the twist (131:36 - 131:40)
they get rid of Pikachu but they keep (131:38 - 131:44)
yeah Pichu retires no I don't think (131:40 - 131:45)
that's gonna happen they they get rid of (131:44 - 131:48)
Ash but they keep Pikachu that Pikachu (131:45 - 131:50)
just gets a new trainer I think very (131:48 - 131:52)
obvious Ash and Pikachu are gonna I (131:50 - 131:54)
don't think this means that Ash is done (131:52 - 131:56)
I I don't think this means that go is (131:54 - 131:58)
gonna take over I don't think this means (131:56 - 132:01)
we'll never see Brock and Misty again (131:58 - 132:05)
um I think go well so he can go anywhere (132:01 - 132:06)
you want I think this is a strong enough (132:05 - 132:08)
go is a strong enough character to (132:06 - 132:10)
return just like Gary was just like (132:08 - 132:12)
Misty was (132:10 - 132:18)
um but I I I I think with at least (132:12 - 132:20)
and to be fair unless you looked at the (132:18 - 132:21)
leaks unless you have no clue what scene (132:20 - 132:23)
I'm talking about it's very quick it's (132:21 - 132:25)
very subtle but like (132:23 - 132:27)
um there is there I guess that's a (132:25 - 132:29)
spoiler sorry there's more than two (132:27 - 132:33)
legendaries in scarlet and violet but I (132:29 - 132:33)
there is karate on there's my ride on (132:35 - 132:39)
there will be more uh the third yellow (132:37 - 132:42)
dog will finally appear finally the best (132:39 - 132:45)
dog both turned spoiler Bolton evolves (132:42 - 132:48)
into the new legendary yeah yeah finally (132:45 - 132:50)
all my dreams coming true (132:48 - 132:52)
it has both a sword and a shield this (132:50 - 132:55)
time yep it's got a sprayer and a suit (132:52 - 132:56)
of armor (132:55 - 133:00)
uh but I I I think that that it would be (132:56 - 133:03)
the worst business decision in the world (133:00 - 133:05)
for them to throw away (133:03 - 133:10)
ashes like as sick as you are of Ash I'm (133:05 - 133:12)
not sure no I'm saying I'm saying to (133:10 - 133:14)
people out there as sick of you are (133:12 - 133:16)
about Ash there's always a new (133:14 - 133:19)
generation that needs a pretty much a (133:16 - 133:22)
blank character to stand in for them and (133:19 - 133:26)
Ash will always be that person (133:22 - 133:26)
Alice furiously trying to find the (133:26 - 133:31)
picture of that I am I am trying to find (133:28 - 133:33)
this I couldn't like it on Twitter (133:31 - 133:36)
because then everyone would see it (133:33 - 133:38)
I'll I'll get it for you after the (133:36 - 133:40)
summer show (133:38 - 133:42)
Ash is sitting I think I think I found (133:40 - 133:44)
it but I haven't I can't see anything in (133:42 - 133:46)
the picture it should be I'll talk about (133:44 - 133:47)
it later it should be Ashton Pikachu (133:46 - 133:48)
sitting on a bed the poster should have (133:47 - 133:50)
like two boats in it and then above the (133:48 - 133:52)
boats is a legendary Pokemon (133:50 - 133:55)
yeah I can't see anything (133:52 - 133:57)
it's probably a bad screenshot then yeah (133:55 - 133:59)
we'll talk about it later yeah you would (133:57 - 134:01)
you would literally you would have to go (133:59 - 134:02)
so far out of your way to find the (134:01 - 134:06)
spoiler it would be yeah I I wouldn't (134:02 - 134:07)
worry about it if you're listening to (134:06 - 134:09)
the podcast it's fine they do that (134:07 - 134:11)
they've done this for past episodes so (134:09 - 134:14)
they've always like hinted yeah in like (134:11 - 134:17)
games and and Anime episodes of future (134:14 - 134:19)
stuff and no one will ever realize it (134:17 - 134:22)
until (134:19 - 134:22)
because then you know and you go oh okay (134:23 - 134:29)
ah (134:27 - 134:31)
uh our final bit of news which will take (134:29 - 134:32)
the most amount of time we were saving (134:31 - 134:34)
the best for last is uh (134:32 - 134:38)
uh Teddy Ursa is now at Build-A-Bear so (134:34 - 134:39)
okay so let's talk about the clothing (134:38 - 134:41)
that you can put on Teddy yourself and (134:39 - 134:43)
how actually having a bear from Pokemon (134:41 - 134:46)
at Build-A-Bear finally makes sense they (134:43 - 134:48)
have finally done the one thing that we (134:46 - 134:50)
want them to do is have a bear from (134:48 - 134:52)
Pokemon in Build-A-Bear (134:50 - 134:56)
anyways the color of the green clothes (134:52 - 134:56)
Build-A-Bear is a nightmare by the way (134:58 - 135:02)
yeah (135:00 - 135:02)
that I I have been I've been into (135:03 - 135:07)
Build-A-Bear multiple times they've (135:05 - 135:10)
announced a Pikachu an Eevee grooky (135:07 - 135:12)
Gengar you name it they've they've had (135:10 - 135:14)
it it's been what two three years since (135:12 - 135:15)
the initial partnership with (135:14 - 135:17)
Build-A-Bear I think longer than that (135:15 - 135:20)
hasn't it wasn't it before 2020. (135:17 - 135:22)
yeah I think before 20 before pandemic (135:20 - 135:24)
for sure yeah (135:22 - 135:26)
um so I've never purchased anything from (135:24 - 135:27)
Build-A-Bear obviously I know how (135:26 - 135:29)
build-a-bear works you pick out uh you (135:27 - 135:31)
pick you pick out a skin (135:29 - 135:34)
and you take the skin over to the the (135:31 - 135:36)
stuffing machine you stick its butt onto (135:34 - 135:39)
the stuffing machine and fills it all up (135:36 - 135:42)
right and then and then you you that (135:39 - 135:44)
that that's what happens at Build-A-Bear (135:42 - 135:51)
so uh I I went on a journey to because (135:44 - 135:55)
because uh my friend really wanted she (135:51 - 135:57)
really wanted that 10 years so so she (135:55 - 135:59)
waited in line Greg will and I we did a (135:57 - 136:01)
couple laps at MOA because she was in (135:59 - 136:04)
line for like an hour here you need to (136:01 - 136:05)
know people but they'll ask me what (136:04 - 136:08)
Steve is like in real life I say I can (136:05 - 136:11)
now say he will abandon you in a line oh (136:08 - 136:15)
yeah do whatever he wants to do he will (136:11 - 136:19)
just straight up abandon you look I got (136:15 - 136:22)
like she she said she's looking good to (136:19 - 136:26)
continue to walk in a circle I it was (136:22 - 136:28)
big Community today Greg I needed the (136:26 - 136:31)
steps you had the steps (136:28 - 136:34)
I did it worse before I did I didn't I (136:31 - 136:37)
was behind I had to walk around my house (136:34 - 136:40)
a 24-hour day thing you could have done (136:37 - 136:42)
him instead you looked at your friend (136:40 - 136:43)
and said (136:42 - 136:47)
peace see ya I'm out to just go walk I (136:43 - 136:49)
was I came back when I came back when (136:47 - 136:52)
the line was over because we made you we (136:49 - 136:54)
I got back you guys were leaving anyway (136:52 - 136:57)

we walk over we grab she grabs the the (137:02 - 137:08)
friend ball t-shirt whatever (137:05 - 137:11)
to wait in another line yeah (137:08 - 137:13)
and then you wait in the line to get it (137:11 - 137:16)
stuffed that was another 45 minutes we (137:13 - 137:18)
she well she waited 45 minutes to get (137:16 - 137:21)
into the store you wait in line another (137:18 - 137:22)
45 minutes when you're done getting it (137:21 - 137:25)
stuff you waited another line to check (137:22 - 137:30)
out it is absolutely insane (137:25 - 137:30)
I've only ever done it once and I did (137:33 - 137:38)
not have to wait in any lines because it (137:37 - 137:40)
was very quiet (137:38 - 137:44)
I have it you can see in the background (137:40 - 137:46)
I have one Build-A-Bear (137:44 - 137:49)
oh that's a polar bear yeah and I (137:46 - 137:50)
ordered it online because I am not doing (137:49 - 137:52)
that in person (137:50 - 137:54)
I can bring it down if you want to see (137:52 - 137:56)
it it's the Jawa (137:54 - 137:57)
uh I don't think I have any in here I (137:56 - 138:00)
have a few I have a Pikachu and a Bowser (137:57 - 138:03)
on a couple of those as well uh we'll (138:00 - 138:06)
say the not my teddy Ursa but looking at (138:03 - 138:08)
this Teddy Ursa in person after it gets (138:06 - 138:10)
got stuffed (138:08 - 138:13)
um very good quality not like that Eevee (138:11 - 138:15)
don't ever get that evf Build-A-Bear it (138:13 - 138:17)
is it is a monster (138:15 - 138:20)
it is it although the girl in front of (138:17 - 138:22)
us did there again I will say I will say (138:20 - 138:25)
while waiting in line multiple lines (138:22 - 138:27)
there were a lot of people in line that (138:25 - 138:31)
were very into Pokemon I saw a little (138:27 - 138:33)
girl it was Community Day I got I saw a (138:31 - 138:35)
little girl brushing her Pikachu skin (138:33 - 138:37)
because it was pre-stuffed it was just (138:35 - 138:40)
this very flat skin (138:37 - 138:40)
it's like it is husk better cradling (138:40 - 138:47)
your Pikachu husk (138:45 - 138:50)
uh I saw I saw a girl with an Eevee the (138:47 - 138:52)
other the other Build-A-Bears that seem (138:50 - 138:54)
to be very popular were just like Disney (138:52 - 138:56)
just like I I had to hear somebody play (138:54 - 138:59)
The Lion King song like 700 times (138:56 - 139:00)
because they weren't sure which three (138:59 - 139:02)
Lion King songs they wanted to put into (139:00 - 139:03)
their I don't even know what they were (139:02 - 139:06)
buying it was like a dog it wasn't even (139:03 - 139:08)
it wasn't even Lion King related (139:06 - 139:10)
uh (139:08 - 139:12)
anyways (139:10 - 139:15)
that that is a heck I don't know where (139:12 - 139:16)
all the teddy Ursa Love Came From (139:15 - 139:18)
there's a bunch of Teddy or some merch (139:16 - 139:19)
happening in Japan there's this Teddy (139:18 - 139:21)
Ursa Build-A-Bear there was Teddy years (139:19 - 139:22)
of community day I don't know why (139:21 - 139:23)
they're going really hard on Teddy Earth (139:22 - 139:25)
all of a sudden but I don't know maybe (139:23 - 139:27)
there's a somebody's got to be set up (139:25 - 139:29)
for the new anime when Ash and Pikachu (139:27 - 139:32)
don't show up maybe maybe there's some (139:29 - 139:35)
Ursa Luna Titan or something coming I (139:32 - 139:37)
don't know why they're pushing 10 years (139:35 - 139:39)
is so hard I actually don't know if 10 (139:37 - 139:42)
years is even in did they show that I (139:39 - 139:43)
should look at my own graphic I don't (139:42 - 139:45)
know if Teddy or I think Teddy Earth is (139:43 - 139:47)
coming back (139:45 - 139:49)
I I would I would wager to assume that (139:47 - 139:51)
if a Pokemon got an evolution in Legends (139:49 - 139:53)
Arceus it would probably be fair game (139:51 - 139:57)
for paldea but I don't actually know (139:53 - 140:00)
uh I think Teddy Ursa is coming back (139:57 - 140:02)
anyways (140:00 - 140:04)
I'm saying nothing (140:02 - 140:07)
uh question of the week (140:04 - 140:11)
question of the week (140:07 - 140:11)
uh this is from Hannah from our YouTube (140:12 - 140:16)
what is the most influential Pokemon (140:14 - 140:18)
generation (140:16 - 140:19)
three (140:18 - 140:23)
I mean it has to be one (140:19 - 140:23)
so I mean if we're talking about like (140:23 - 140:27)
overall global (140:25 - 140:29)
influence (140:27 - 140:31)
I don't see how you can argue anything (140:29 - 140:33)
other than one (140:31 - 140:35)
I mean it depends on what you it depends (140:33 - 140:39)
on on what you mean by influential so (140:35 - 140:42)
like influence on the world (140:39 - 140:44)
as far as impact yeah gen one if you're (140:42 - 140:47)
talking about influential on the series (140:44 - 140:50)
as a whole I think it's gen three like (140:47 - 140:53)
Gen 3 is this is where they deliberately (140:50 - 140:56)
made choices to say that this is going (140:53 - 140:58)
to be an ongoing series since we know (140:56 - 141:02)
Gen 2 was meant to be the last gen 3 (140:58 - 141:04)
yeah really to me shows that they were (141:02 - 141:07)
willing to jump into a brand new system (141:04 - 141:09)
knowing that people couldn't bring (141:07 - 141:11)
things forward and say we are going to (141:09 - 141:13)
deliberately start making this uh (141:11 - 141:15)
ongoing (141:13 - 141:16)
Forever series (141:15 - 141:19)
and you can see all those markers in gen (141:16 - 141:20)
3. (141:19 - 141:21)
um so (141:20 - 141:24)
World impact genuine because (141:21 - 141:28)
it introduced Pokemon Series game impact (141:24 - 141:29)
gen 3. (141:28 - 141:32)
gosh I would say gen 5. (141:29 - 141:36)
oh interesting I would say Gen 5 because (141:32 - 141:39)
uh I to I I would no I don't think (141:36 - 141:41)
anyone's saying Gen 2 or Gen 4 (141:39 - 141:44)
uh because because Gen 2 is a (141:41 - 141:46)
continuation of everything of gen 1 and (141:44 - 141:47)
everything was like slightly better Gen (141:46 - 141:49)
4 felt like everything was slightly (141:47 - 141:53)
better but like no huge impacts Gen 5 to (141:49 - 141:56)
me felt like that (141:53 - 142:02)
they were okay making a choice that (141:56 - 142:06)
would upset fans on their terms gen 3 (142:02 - 142:08)
was a hardware limitation (142:06 - 142:10)
that they knew would upset fans but (142:08 - 142:12)
something they had to do and I think (142:10 - 142:14)
Greg is right and like they they set a (142:12 - 142:16)
new Foundation because of Hardware (142:14 - 142:19)
because they were they had to well Jenna (142:16 - 142:22)
had to but they also set but you can (142:19 - 142:25)
also see in their game designs at that (142:22 - 142:26)
point (142:25 - 142:29)
they had started to Future proof had (142:26 - 142:32)
started to draw the lines of what they (142:29 - 142:34)
wanted their games to be going forward (142:32 - 142:38)
and I think every game has really built (142:34 - 142:42)
off of gen 3 and refined it down so I'm (142:38 - 142:44)
curious what major shift do you think (142:42 - 142:47)
happened in Gen 5 that wasn't a building (142:44 - 142:50)
off of what they had already laid as a (142:47 - 142:52)
foundation I think (142:50 - 142:56)
if the games continued in a sense of Gen (142:52 - 143:00)
2 3 4 and just that pattern of slow (142:56 - 143:03)
iterations the series would have went (143:00 - 143:05)
the way of like a Yokai Watch or a (143:03 - 143:06)
digimon (143:05 - 143:09)
and by throwing everything out and (143:06 - 143:11)
saying we're not going to rely on (143:09 - 143:12)
Charizard we're not going to rely on (143:11 - 143:14)
Tyranitar we're not going to rely on (143:12 - 143:18)
Pikachu here's a 150 new creatures (143:14 - 143:21)
here's a new world here are all of these (143:18 - 143:23)
quality of life updates that should have (143:21 - 143:27)
existed in gen 4. and we we are we are (143:23 - 143:30)
confident that going forward we even (143:27 - 143:31)
though we know that this will upset (143:30 - 143:33)
people just like they knew that cutting (143:31 - 143:35)
the national decks were upset people it (143:33 - 143:38)
was the right decision a hundred percent (143:35 - 143:41)
but they threw everything out (143:38 - 143:44)
for gen three right like (143:41 - 143:46)
yeah but they didn't include Charizard (143:44 - 143:48)
or any of them in that Pokedex they (143:46 - 143:51)
didn't exist until (143:48 - 143:51)
which came out later like what you're (143:51 - 143:56)
saying they did for Gen fight they had (143:54 - 143:58)
already done it would have been easy for (143:56 - 144:00)
them in gen 3 to say let's include all (143:58 - 144:02)
the popular ones from gen 1 and Gen 2 (144:00 - 144:04)
and they didn't they said we're starting (144:02 - 144:06)
fresh (144:04 - 144:08)
out of General Ninja 2 Pokemon though (144:06 - 144:12)
they had some in the Safari (144:08 - 144:12)
you don't run into a gen 1 or 2 Pokemon (144:13 - 144:18)
until way late in that yeah but that's (144:16 - 144:21)
because like they they were going to do (144:18 - 144:22)
all new Pokemon and then they realized (144:21 - 144:23)
they couldn't that's why the first (144:22 - 144:25)
couple routes are all new Pokemon and (144:23 - 144:27)
then all of a sudden they that you (144:25 - 144:29)
you're then you get all the the old ones (144:27 - 144:32)
this is well that's well documented on (144:29 - 144:35)
how how the beginning of the game was (144:32 - 144:38)
was in like a nutshell of them thinking (144:35 - 144:40)
everything was going to be new and then (144:38 - 144:43)
them panicking and starting putting old (144:40 - 144:44)
Pokemon in but they didn't go back to (144:43 - 144:46)
the first couple routes to put all (144:44 - 144:48)
Pokemon in that was a lie like (144:46 - 144:49)
the beginning of that game feels so (144:48 - 144:51)
fresh and then all of a sudden like it (144:49 - 144:55)
kind of goes back to what they relied on (144:51 - 144:55)
I think there's also if we're talking (144:56 - 145:00)
about influential to the game franchise (144:58 - 145:02)
rather than the world which okay that (145:00 - 145:03)
probably creates more discussion that's (145:02 - 145:05)
fair uh I would also say there's an (145:03 - 145:08)
argument for six as well because yeah (145:05 - 145:11)
the the the transition from Sprites to (145:08 - 145:13)
models was (145:11 - 145:16)
possibly one of the possibly the biggest (145:13 - 145:18)
Graphics change they have ever and will (145:16 - 145:20)
ever do (145:18 - 145:20)
um (145:20 - 145:23)
and yeah sure like obviously more games (145:20 - 145:25)
just now are probably more different (145:23 - 145:26)
from (145:25 - 145:30)
generation six than generation 5 was but (145:26 - 145:33)
that one generation jump I think was the (145:30 - 145:35)
biggest in terms of Graphics which said (145:33 - 145:37)
we are we we are no longer doing this (145:35 - 145:40)
and even remakes are not like that you (145:37 - 145:42)
know there is has not been a game with (145:40 - 145:44)
purely Sprites they have obviously (145:42 - 145:47)
Sprites in some menus but there is not a (145:44 - 145:48)
game that has been purely Sprites since (145:47 - 145:51)
that happened (145:48 - 145:54)
yeah uh judge 5 was also the like we (145:51 - 145:56)
care about competitive yeah which has (145:54 - 145:59)
has led a very which is kind of shocking (145:56 - 146:02)
how like you they (145:59 - 146:03)
you know the the games that were (146:02 - 146:05)
supposed to be this collection aspect (146:03 - 146:09)
right like uh uh the I collected bugs (146:05 - 146:11)
and now I want to turn this into a game (146:09 - 146:12)
and they were like well this isn't a (146:11 - 146:14)
very fun game so we have to like add (146:12 - 146:16)
battling and then the anime was very (146:14 - 146:18)
like I want to be the very best battler (146:16 - 146:20)
and then you know you could do that (146:18 - 146:22)
right like you could you could battle (146:20 - 146:24)
people in Gen 2 right we could Greg and (146:22 - 146:26)
I could hook up our Link cable we could (146:24 - 146:28)
battle and then Gen 4 they kind of (146:26 - 146:31)
started that and Gen 5 was like really (146:28 - 146:33)
seriously like (146:31 - 146:36)
people want to be like ash people want (146:33 - 146:38)
to know that they are the very best and (146:36 - 146:40)
now we have a system we have tournaments (146:38 - 146:42)
we have World Championships (146:40 - 146:45)
which kind of started in in Gen 4 but (146:42 - 146:47)
they really solidified and moved forward (146:45 - 146:49)
of the and that was a thing I wanted as (146:47 - 146:51)
a kid right like I thought I was very (146:49 - 146:53)
good at Pokemon I thought I was the best (146:51 - 146:56)
I thought I was like an ash right like I (146:53 - 146:59)
I beat the Elite Four I beat blue or (146:56 - 147:00)
Gary or whoever you named your rival (146:59 - 147:03)
like I am the best Pokemon person (147:00 - 147:07)
um and Gen 5 really was like here is a (147:03 - 147:09)
here here is a competitive (147:07 - 147:12)
thing that exists and we're going to (147:09 - 147:14)
stick with this and move forward and (147:12 - 147:15)
they also didn't give up on that either (147:14 - 147:17)
like if anything that has been very (147:15 - 147:21)
solid I I do think like you can point at (147:17 - 147:24)
another Generations where they got more (147:21 - 147:26)
serious about a certain aspect of the (147:24 - 147:29)
game yeah yeah yeah like (147:26 - 147:30)
you know here's when they finally (147:29 - 147:34)
realized how they could do VGC and do (147:30 - 147:36)
all those things and then refined it (147:34 - 147:38)
down from it like it's it's interesting (147:36 - 147:40)
that you can look at as you if you've (147:38 - 147:41)
played these games for a long time when (147:40 - 147:43)
you can point to a thing and say (147:41 - 147:46)
here's where they made that decision (147:43 - 147:48)
here's where they made that decision (147:46 - 147:50)
because they've been building off it (147:48 - 147:54)
ever since and it didn't exist before (147:50 - 147:54)
okay I think we'll wrap up no Pokemon of (147:55 - 148:00)
the week no will this week uh I'm not (147:58 - 148:02)
sure when will will be back on because (148:00 - 148:04)
we're gonna do because will plays very (148:02 - 148:08)
slow yeah and he he likes taking his (148:04 - 148:09)
time he likes taking his time we are (148:08 - 148:11)
going to be will and I are going to be (148:09 - 148:13)
gone for an entire weekend so yeah and I (148:11 - 148:14)
will I will also be gone for a weekend (148:13 - 148:17)
so um you know podcast is going to come (148:14 - 148:18)
out every Monday no matter what there (148:17 - 148:20)
will be a mini series Greg and I do want (148:18 - 148:22)
to record something and I don't know if (148:20 - 148:24)
we're going to include another person on (148:22 - 148:25)
Friday night after we spend a couple (148:24 - 148:27)
hours with the game that will probably (148:25 - 148:29)
go out on Saturday (148:27 - 148:30)
um which let me get some dates for you (148:29 - 148:32)
guys (148:30 - 148:34)
um so if you're listening to this this (148:32 - 148:38)
would be uh May for uh may this would be (148:34 - 148:41)
November 14th and then there will be (148:38 - 148:44)
probably an Impressions episode on (148:41 - 148:48)
November 19th and then a normal episode (148:44 - 148:51)
on the 21st now in that normal episode (148:48 - 148:52)
we will probably talk about the (148:51 - 148:54)
mechanics of the game but nothing Story (148:52 - 148:56)
related (148:54 - 148:57)
um and obviously that will be time (148:56 - 148:59)
stamped and then I'm thinking probably (148:57 - 149:02)
Thursday or Friday the 24th or the 25th (148:59 - 149:05)
there will be another bonus episode and (149:02 - 149:07)
that's probably where we'll start (149:05 - 149:11)
some sort of series of like (149:07 - 149:14)
two Gems or three gyms or you know Al (149:11 - 149:16)
went North pengu went right Greg went (149:14 - 149:19)
left I went South there's nothing South (149:16 - 149:23)
it's just a beach uh so (149:19 - 149:24)
it's it's really hard to do because it's (149:23 - 149:26)
like an open world game (149:24 - 149:28)
um so you know even (149:26 - 149:32)
if we went in the perceived order it's (149:28 - 149:34)
like well are we all skipping team star (149:32 - 149:36)
are we doing this and team star are we (149:34 - 149:40)
doing this team star and Titans uh so we (149:36 - 149:43)
we we need at least (149:40 - 149:45)
a day or two with this game to kind of (149:43 - 149:47)
figure out what our our game plan is (149:45 - 149:50)
with legends that that game was really (149:47 - 149:54)
short yeah so uh we did that and we also (149:50 - 149:57)
had defined areas as well yeah yeah (149:54 - 150:00)
we did all of Legends in in three (149:57 - 150:01)
episodes (150:00 - 150:03)
um although those episodes were longer (150:01 - 150:06)
