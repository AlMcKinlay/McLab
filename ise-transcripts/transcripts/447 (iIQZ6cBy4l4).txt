the cuties (1:39 - 1:43)

said i don't think any (1:43 - 1:46)
dramatic pokemon news is gonna drop on a (1:44 - 1:47)
saturday night but i don't know japan (1:46 - 1:48)
sometimes (1:47 - 1:52)
they have no bounds and then we are (1:48 - 1:54)
about when this episode comes up we're (1:52 - 1:57)
like two episodes away from pokemon day (1:54 - 1:59)
so we'll see if any new games get (1:57 - 2:01)
announced or (1:59 - 2:03)
shirts or clothing or any other brand (2:01 - 2:05)
deals that pokemon wants to do this year (2:03 - 2:05)
they're (2:05 - 2:07)
doing quite a bit uh which we're going (2:05 - 2:08)
to talk about (2:07 - 2:10)
before we begin happy black history (2:08 - 2:12)
month the pokemon company did (2:10 - 2:14)
tweet today for the first time ever in (2:12 - 2:17)
history uh happy black history month (2:14 - 2:20)
and i believe they are featuring black (2:17 - 2:20)
cop (2:20 - 2:24)
black pokemon cosplayers uh every single (2:20 - 2:25)
day on their twitter (2:24 - 2:28)
um and they started today with a black (2:25 - 2:29)
leon cosplayer (2:28 - 2:32)
so that is new obviously the social (2:29 - 2:33)
media team (2:32 - 2:36)
at the pokemon company international (2:33 - 2:39)
really breaking down walls over there (2:36 - 2:42)
i would say that like five years ago (2:39 - 2:44)
their twitter was the most boring (2:42 - 2:46)
sterile corporate thing (2:44 - 2:49)
in the world yup (2:46 - 2:51)
now i feel like most people look forward (2:49 - 2:52)
to the (2:51 - 2:54)
tweets that the social media team is (2:52 - 2:56)
doing over at tcpi (2:54 - 2:59)
so good for them let's start off what's (2:56 - 3:00)
our best news this week (2:59 - 3:03)
um probably the person that got arrested (3:00 - 3:04)
for selling hacked pokemon (3:03 - 3:08)
we'll say heck yeah yeah i'm into it (3:04 - 3:09)
we got a good one yeah we gotta save (3:08 - 3:11)
that to that one uh let's start off with (3:09 - 3:13)
some uh lighter news here (3:11 - 3:14)
[Music] (3:13 - 3:17)
netflix's of pokemon journeys is ending (3:14 - 3:18)
but but (3:17 - 3:21)
but that actually means that that season (3:18 - 3:22)
is ending (3:21 - 3:23)
i feel like all these articles are (3:22 - 3:25)
clickbaity to think like oh are they (3:23 - 3:26)
done (3:25 - 3:29)
um but japan is already on the second (3:26 - 3:31)
season of journeys but i'm (3:29 - 3:33)
sure that it's going to be named (3:31 - 3:35)
differently here (3:33 - 3:38)
but on march 5th to 2021 (3:35 - 3:41)
it will be the last they're doing 12 (3:38 - 3:42)
episodes right so it'll be the last 12 (3:41 - 3:43)
episodes yeah (3:42 - 3:46)
and then um then we don't know uh i (3:43 - 3:48)
would assume (3:46 - 3:50)
that they'll probably show or preview (3:48 - 3:52)
something around the time (3:50 - 3:55)
but i believe that these are doing (3:52 - 3:57)
pretty well on netflix so i don't see (3:55 - 3:58)
why i don't (3:57 - 4:00)
know i don't know where else pokemon (3:58 - 4:01)
would go like i don't know if they would (4:00 - 4:03)
be like oh we're starting the second (4:01 - 4:04)
season on disney plus (4:03 - 4:08)
or like i think they're (4:04 - 4:10)
probably pretty okay with netflix and (4:08 - 4:12)
the only reason i say that is because i (4:10 - 4:13)
have (4:12 - 4:14)
so i have another article here from (4:13 - 4:16)
cbr.com pokemon (4:14 - 4:18)
is still powering american anime fandom (4:16 - 4:20)
according to netflix (4:18 - 4:22)
according to netflix's 2020 year in (4:20 - 4:24)
review the streaming service and uh the (4:22 - 4:26)
streaming services anime viewership has (4:24 - 4:27)
grown 100 (4:26 - 4:29)
in the last year and pokemon the movie (4:27 - 4:30)
strikes back (4:29 - 4:33)
evolution was one of the most viewed (4:30 - 4:34)
viewed animes (4:33 - 4:36)
of the year pokemon the movie strikes (4:34 - 4:37)
back (4:36 - 4:38)
that wasn't the name of the movie (4:37 - 4:40)
pokemon (4:38 - 4:42)
youtube strikes back evolution okay you (4:40 - 4:44)
left out a word (4:42 - 4:47)
what word did i leave out mewtwo oh (4:44 - 4:51)
my pokemon destroys back evolution yeah (4:47 - 4:54)
pokemon the movie strikes back and i'm (4:51 - 4:55)
like what (4:54 - 4:58)
movie mewtwo that movie is real weird (4:55 - 5:02)
animation wise wasn't it done like uh (4:58 - 5:05)
with like kind of 3d style uh (5:02 - 5:08)
what is the computer animation cgi yeah (5:05 - 5:08)
i'm (5:08 - 5:10)
behind on the pokemon anime i have to (5:08 - 5:12)
catch up yeah i needed this news three (5:10 - 5:13)
hours ago (5:12 - 5:14)
when i finished watching the card fight (5:13 - 5:16)
vanguard anime and i mean i've literally (5:14 - 5:18)
now have watched every single episode of (5:16 - 5:20)
that anime that has ever come out while (5:18 - 5:21)
i was at the gym and i was like (5:20 - 5:23)
boy i need a new anime to start watching (5:21 - 5:25)
while i'm at the gym i need something (5:23 - 5:26)
that's not going to be offensive to the (5:25 - 5:28)
people standing behind me (5:26 - 5:30)
and because you weren't there to tell me (5:28 - 5:32)
remind me to watch pokemon (5:30 - 5:35)
i started up attack on titan again well (5:32 - 5:36)
there you go (5:35 - 5:39)
i feel like that would get you the looks (5:36 - 5:40)
that would get you the looks (5:39 - 5:43)
exactly i make bad choices without input (5:40 - 5:43)
from (5:43 - 5:46)
other people why did you text (5:43 - 5:49)

rumored to launch february (6:34 - 6:37)
launched in february the set is to (6:36 - 6:39)
feature 25 cards consisting of pokemon (6:37 - 6:41)
starters throughout various series (6:39 - 6:43)
fans uh have a chance of getting pikachu (6:41 - 6:45)
who is a starter in yellow (6:43 - 6:47)
thanks hypebeast for the most boring (6:45 - 6:50)
overlay a supposed mcdonald's manager (6:47 - 6:53)
named uh mj revealed that the happy meal (6:50 - 6:54)
set is to come with (6:53 - 6:58)
four card booster packs each pack will (6:54 - 6:59)
reportedly contain (6:58 - 7:01)
four different starter pokemon one which (6:59 - 7:02)
will be hollow (7:01 - 7:05)
the other three non-hollow that means (7:02 - 7:07)
that the 25 cards will be available both (7:05 - 7:09)
as hollow and non-holo bringing the card (7:07 - 7:11)
total up to fifty dollars (7:09 - 7:14)
or up to 50 total the pokemon company (7:11 - 7:16)
has yet to reveal any promotional (7:14 - 7:18)
details about this however mcdonald's (7:16 - 7:20)
has already began advertising (7:18 - 7:22)
pokey beach has confirmed that the (7:20 - 7:23)
booster packs (7:22 - 7:26)
will be sold separately mcdonald's so i (7:23 - 7:28)
could just like buy it at mcdonald's (7:26 - 7:30)
yes mcdonald's happy meal and pokemon (7:28 - 7:32)
trading card promotion will reportedly (7:30 - 7:33)
take (7:32 - 7:35)
reportedly take place on february 9th (7:33 - 7:37)
and onwards across (7:35 - 7:39)
uh select locations in the nation i (7:37 - 7:41)
think they always have to say select (7:39 - 7:43)
right because yes yeah yeah because (7:41 - 7:45)
there's to be like a mcdonald's in like (7:43 - 7:46)
martha texas (7:45 - 7:49)
that is just not they didn't get their (7:46 - 7:50)
shipment (7:49 - 7:52)
yep well i have two comments on this (7:50 - 7:53)
number one (7:52 - 7:55)
we're obviously going to mcdonald's when (7:53 - 7:56)
you come to visit (7:55 - 8:00)
me and greg and getting cards yes (7:56 - 8:02)
and uh assuming that cards will not be (8:00 - 8:03)
sold out i was just going to say and (8:02 - 8:04)
number two (8:03 - 8:06)
there's no way we're going to get cards (8:04 - 8:08)
because people are going to go (8:06 - 8:10)
nuts and (8:08 - 8:10)
mcdonald's pokemon cards thinking that (8:11 - 8:15)
they're striking it rich (8:14 - 8:18)
well the question now is like how much (8:15 - 8:19)
is a happy meal (8:18 - 8:21)
because you can just buy you could just (8:19 - 8:22)
buy the happy meal toy by itself how (8:21 - 8:24)
much is happy meal (8:22 - 8:26)
toy well i mean happy meals the cost of (8:24 - 8:28)
a happy meal varies by (8:26 - 8:30)
where you are i mean in new york city a (8:28 - 8:31)
happy meal cost you 23 (8:30 - 8:35)
25 to 30 dollars in you know (8:31 - 8:38)
i don't know pueblo colorado it's like (8:35 - 8:38)
they (8:38 - 8:40)
actually give you money please take (8:38 - 8:42)
these happy meals off our hands (8:40 - 8:44)
we have so many well if you can buy the (8:42 - 8:45)
cards separately (8:44 - 8:49)
it's a four pack okay so uh this person (8:45 - 8:50)
on reddit said (8:49 - 8:52)
they worked at mcdonald's and the toys (8:50 - 8:55)
themselves cost a dollar sixty nine (8:52 - 8:56)
so if you just went through the drive (8:55 - 8:58)
through oh this person says at my (8:56 - 8:59)
mcdonald's we charge (8:58 - 9:03)
a dollar ninety nine and then this other (8:59 - 9:05)
person said at my mcdonald's they cost a (9:03 - 9:06)
dollar (9:05 - 9:07)
seventy i guess that makes sense because (9:06 - 9:09)
sometimes if you go to like the real (9:07 - 9:10)
like (9:09 - 9:13)
shady mcdonald's their sauce cups are (9:10 - 9:13)
like (9:13 - 9:16)
more it's like 75 cents instead of 50 (9:13 - 9:18)
cents for like barbecue sauce (9:16 - 9:20)
and then other mcdonald's they were like (9:18 - 9:21)
oh we don't even charge for sauce here (9:20 - 9:23)
you go (9:21 - 9:25)
is that franchise life yep so do we even (9:23 - 9:28)
know what these cards are (9:25 - 9:30)
pikachu and then the other starters (9:28 - 9:31)
that's all like (9:30 - 9:34)
what makes them worth this money oh (9:31 - 9:35)
they're not good (9:34 - 9:38)
um so nothing oh here's mike (9:35 - 9:40)
all the time expensive they're also not (9:38 - 9:42)
good they're just charizard (9:40 - 9:45)
how much how many cards are in a regular (9:42 - 9:46)
pack of pokemon cards (9:45 - 9:49)
10. you get 10 cards and that's usually (9:46 - 9:51)
dollars and fifty cents (9:49 - 9:54)
unless you do sbj (9:51 - 9:57)
gymnastics of going in with somebody and (9:54 - 9:59)
buying packs and blah blah blah did you (9:57 - 10:00)
watch my youtube video will (9:59 - 10:03)
no i don't the only thing i watch on (10:00 - 10:04)
youtube (10:03 - 10:06)
yeah you watch people who steal other (10:04 - 10:08)
people's tick tocks put them on youtube (10:06 - 10:10)
i understand (10:08 - 10:13)
unless your youtube tick tocks have (10:10 - 10:16)
shirtless guys doing the rasputin dance (10:13 - 10:20)
that's not coming up on my youtube queue (10:16 - 10:23)
here's the thing so they're worth two (10:20 - 10:23)
dollars then (10:23 - 10:26)
four cards for two dollars is is is (10:23 - 10:27)
pretty much the rate (10:26 - 10:28)
but you can go to the dollar tree and (10:27 - 10:32)
get a dollar booster pack for a dollar (10:28 - 10:34)
you can't get pokemon cards at a dollar (10:32 - 10:35)
tree yeah you can they're (10:34 - 10:38)
they're it's a three pack oh i mean not (10:35 - 10:40)
since the last time i was at a dollar (10:38 - 10:41)
tree which was probably about a decade (10:40 - 10:42)
ago (10:41 - 10:44)
i just opened dollar tree booster packs (10:42 - 10:45)
on my stream (10:44 - 10:48)
i pulled the ice qv are you streaming (10:45 - 10:49)
tic tocs (10:48 - 10:52)
no then you're not getting my computer (10:49 - 10:53)
video time sorry bud (10:52 - 10:55)
sorry okay so if i if you could go to a (10:53 - 10:58)
dollar tree or a family dollar or (10:55 - 11:01)
a five below dollars rs yeah (10:58 - 11:05)
we should start dollars rs we could (11:01 - 11:08)
you can get three cards in a dollar pack (11:05 - 11:10)
but you're not guaranteed a rare you're (11:08 - 11:12)
not even guaranteed a reverse holo you (11:10 - 11:13)
could get three commons (11:12 - 11:16)
you get two commons one uncommon you can (11:13 - 11:16)
get (11:16 - 11:19)
two commons one reverse holo you get two (11:16 - 11:21)
one common one uncommon and then (11:19 - 11:24)
like a a secret rare like you can get (11:21 - 11:27)
good cards in a dollar pack it's just (11:24 - 11:28)
they don't have set (11:27 - 11:32)
odds like who who makes these packs (11:28 - 11:33)
the pokemon company they're official (11:32 - 11:35)
packs they're official packs they're (11:33 - 11:36)
legit official packs (11:35 - 11:39)
are we sure it's not like a no no it's (11:36 - 11:41)
100 percent going to (11:39 - 11:44)
target and pulling out a pack and rip it (11:41 - 11:45)
open and resealing it (11:44 - 11:47)
because i believe you have been bitten (11:45 - 11:49)
by the reseal i have been bitten by (11:47 - 11:51)
the resale but the dollar packs you can (11:49 - 11:52)
get a dollar tree (11:51 - 11:56)
and and family dollar and dollars are us (11:52 - 11:58)
uh their official packs they even talk (11:56 - 12:00)
about it on support.pokemon.com (11:58 - 12:02)
and i believe they're just more targeted (12:00 - 12:04)
towards like low income (12:02 - 12:07)
slash younger children and i've heard a (12:04 - 12:08)
lot of parents like to get the dollar (12:07 - 12:09)
packs (12:08 - 12:12)
because one they're cheaper and two like (12:09 - 12:13)
they're they're good (12:12 - 12:15)
like reinforcement rewards for their (12:13 - 12:17)
kids they're like oh if you (12:15 - 12:20)
get all your homework done here you get (12:17 - 12:21)
your pack of pokemon cards but it's only (12:20 - 12:22)
a dollar pack (12:21 - 12:24)
yeah it's a really inexpensive way to (12:22 - 12:26)
get your children into gambling correct (12:24 - 12:27)
greg (12:26 - 12:29)
yes if you do everything you get to (12:27 - 12:30)
gamble (12:29 - 12:32)
maybe you'll get something you want (12:30 - 12:34)
that's life it's full of disappointment (12:32 - 12:36)
so you can work hard and still not get (12:34 - 12:38)
what you're looking for (12:36 - 12:41)
so life lessons abound so i'm assuming (12:38 - 12:45)
that the mcdonald's packs are (12:41 - 12:47)
going to be whatever mcdonald's sets it (12:45 - 12:49)
at so if mcdonald's is charging (12:47 - 12:51)
on 199 for a toy i'm assuming the pack (12:49 - 12:52)
would be 1.99 (12:51 - 12:54)
if your mcdonald's in i don't know (12:52 - 12:56)
hawaii is charging 169 i would assume (12:54 - 12:57)
that the pack of cards is one of those (12:56 - 12:59)
oh no trust the mcdonald's in (12:57 - 13:03)
hawaii is charging 40 yes they are (12:59 - 13:05)
you got to bring all that stuff in on (13:03 - 13:08)
the boat dude the question is (13:05 - 13:11)
is the current tcg fad (13:08 - 13:13)
which i covered on youtube like i said i (13:11 - 13:15)
was and that video is (13:13 - 13:17)
is literally one of the best videos i've (13:15 - 13:20)
put out on youtube since i've started my (13:17 - 13:22)
very mediocre youtube career that video (13:20 - 13:23)
is doing really well (13:22 - 13:26)
and it pretty much shows why (13:23 - 13:28)
we talked about this last week but i (13:26 - 13:30)
have but this (13:28 - 13:32)
i have visuals on the youtube why people (13:30 - 13:34)
care about pokemon cards (13:32 - 13:36)
why pokemon cards are so hard to find (13:34 - 13:38)
and what's happening with pokemon cards (13:36 - 13:40)
so the question is now that these (13:38 - 13:42)
mcdonald's cards are about to come out (13:40 - 13:42)
in (13:42 - 13:45)
uh tuesday yeah are they just going to (13:42 - 13:46)
be instantly (13:45 - 13:50)
sold out which like my thought processes (13:46 - 13:53)
i would like to collect all 50 cards (13:50 - 13:54)
that would be cool (13:53 - 13:57)
i would then probably have to buy i (13:54 - 13:58)
don't even know how many packs all right (13:57 - 14:02)
like you could so there's 25 hollows but (13:58 - 14:03)
they come with (14:02 - 14:06)
four but only one can be hollow so at (14:03 - 14:08)
bare minimum you would have to buy (14:06 - 14:12)
25 packs but the likelihood of you (14:08 - 14:14)
you would probably be more likely to (14:12 - 14:16)
find a one in 8 thousand (14:14 - 14:20)
shiny in pokemon platinum then you would (14:16 - 14:23)
buy 25 packs and have every single holo (14:20 - 14:24)
be different (14:23 - 14:27)
wait so do you it's it's it's 25 (14:24 - 14:30)
cards which can either be hollow or not (14:27 - 14:31)
hollow so it's not (14:30 - 14:33)
50 cards that you need you want 25 (14:31 - 14:35)
hollow cards and you're going to toss (14:33 - 14:36)
the non-hollow ones (14:35 - 14:38)
no uh it's going to be way easier to (14:36 - 14:40)
collect the 25 non-hollow (14:38 - 14:42)
because you're getting three non (14:40 - 14:44)
honestly going to say that you want the (14:42 - 14:46)
non-hollow cards when you're willing to (14:44 - 14:47)
put forth the effort to get all of the (14:46 - 14:49)
hollow cards (14:47 - 14:51)
no i'm gonna have so many non-hollow (14:49 - 14:52)
duplicates that i'll just (14:51 - 14:55)
give them to people and i'll keep one of (14:52 - 14:56)
each of the non-hollow (14:55 - 14:59)
that's easy to collect yes so i don't (14:56 - 15:00)
want to be (14:59 - 15:02)
i don't want to be that guy that goes to (15:00 - 15:04)
the i'm going to be that guy (15:02 - 15:05)
i'm going to go i'm going to go to (15:04 - 15:07)
mcdonald's drive through i'm going to (15:05 - 15:09)
say can i get 25 booster packs they're (15:07 - 15:10)
going to give me a weird look (15:09 - 15:12)
but i also don't want to buy 25 happy (15:10 - 15:14)
meals or eat at mcdonald's (15:12 - 15:16)
that often you eat them because that (15:14 - 15:17)
often now (15:16 - 15:19)
yeah but i'm like the dollar menu kind (15:17 - 15:21)
of guy like give me the picture (15:19 - 15:23)
give me the mcchicken no lettuce the (15:21 - 15:24)
mcdouble just ketchup and mustard medium (15:23 - 15:26)
fry thank you oh (15:24 - 15:29)
god everything about that sutton made me (15:26 - 15:30)
sick (15:29 - 15:32)
yeah it's it's a whole other way of (15:30 - 15:33)
living (15:32 - 15:36)
it's just we're not in that world god (15:33 - 15:37)
what's gonna happen is you're gonna get (15:36 - 15:38)
25 (15:37 - 15:41)
packs and then you're gonna get (15:38 - 15:44)
10 holo charmeleons yeah and then 15 (15:41 - 15:46)
assorted (15:44 - 15:49)
yeah i know and then (15:46 - 15:51)
but because pokemon cards are so hot (15:49 - 15:53)
right now that's probably not going to (15:51 - 15:54)
happen because probably the car (15:53 - 15:57)
in front of me is going to say how many (15:54 - 15:58)
happy meal (15:57 - 16:00)
pokemon cards do you have and they're (15:58 - 16:02)
going to say i don't know we got like (16:00 - 16:03)
200 and they're going to be like i'll (16:02 - 16:05)
buy them all no (16:03 - 16:06)
what they're going to do is they're (16:05 - 16:08)
going to say limit five per customer (16:06 - 16:12)
there's no way north avenue (16:08 - 16:14)
in milwaukee wisconsin is going to care (16:12 - 16:17)
about limiting any sort of pokemon cards (16:14 - 16:18)
they're going to be like oh you want (16:17 - 16:20)
them all cool (16:18 - 16:23)
let me remember mcdonald's and you're (16:20 - 16:24)
right (16:23 - 16:26)
you are correct these people do not get (16:24 - 16:28)
paid enough to care (16:26 - 16:30)
or to argue with the customers about how (16:28 - 16:33)
many happy meals they want to buy (16:30 - 16:34)
well because they're not buying happy (16:33 - 16:36)
meals they're just buying packs yeah (16:34 - 16:39)
i mean mcdonald's has done other things (16:36 - 16:40)
that people (16:39 - 16:42)
wanted to like i'm sure there are barbie (16:40 - 16:44)
fans out there when mcdonald's has a new (16:42 - 16:46)
barbie line they're like i need (16:44 - 16:48)
give sell me all the barbie stuff please (16:46 - 16:49)
i'm just like (16:48 - 16:52)
what a huge waste of money because (16:49 - 16:54)
they're not gonna even be good cards (16:52 - 16:56)
that you wouldn't even put in a real (16:54 - 16:57)
deck (16:56 - 16:58)
there might be one that was good there (16:57 - 17:00)
was some mcdonald's um (16:58 - 17:02)
oh gosh i think it was a mcdonald's (17:00 - 17:03)
bulbasaur that was really good at one (17:02 - 17:05)
point it was either bulbasaur squirtle (17:03 - 17:07)
it was never charmander (17:05 - 17:09)
remainder was always bad so where do (17:07 - 17:10)
these fall (17:09 - 17:14)
in the whole phase them out (17:10 - 17:16)
timeline like is there a point are (17:14 - 17:18)
mcdonald's cards (17:16 - 17:20)
always valid and they will never phase (17:18 - 17:21)
out or (17:20 - 17:23)
no they're no no no they rotate they (17:21 - 17:24)
rotate these (17:23 - 17:26)
these cards will be in rotation for (17:24 - 17:28)
probably three years the question is (17:26 - 17:28)
like (17:28 - 17:32)
is there going to be playable blastoise (17:28 - 17:33)
venusaurs (17:32 - 17:36)
the blazikens like are (17:33 - 17:37)
are there going to be playable versions (17:36 - 17:40)
that will make you needing to use the (17:37 - 17:42)
base mcdonald's version in a deck (17:40 - 17:44)
probably not but like i said there was (17:42 - 17:45)
like a (17:44 - 17:47)
i can't remember if it was like venusaur (17:45 - 17:48)
genesect or if it was like a blastoise (17:47 - 17:49)
keldeo (17:48 - 17:52)
but one of the mcdonald's starters were (17:49 - 17:52)
it had like (17:52 - 17:56)
10 more hp than the other like squirtles (17:52 - 17:58)
and so like the mcdonald's squirtle was (17:56 - 17:59)
like the preferred squirtle because it (17:58 - 18:00)
was like (17:59 - 18:02)
it had slightly more health slightly (18:00 - 18:03)
more survivability (18:02 - 18:06)
yeah so and mcdonald's cars normally (18:03 - 18:09)
hold their price like i think those (18:06 - 18:11)
squirtles were like six dollars each (18:09 - 18:13)
but yeah if it's like a snivy that no (18:11 - 18:14)
one's playing it's probably gonna be (18:13 - 18:15)
like a (18:14 - 18:18)
15 cent card but i don't think the uh (18:15 - 18:21)
i don't think the tcg phases uh the (18:18 - 18:22)
phase we're going through is ending (18:21 - 18:23)
anytime soon (18:22 - 18:27)
no well maybe soon but just not at this (18:23 - 18:27)
moment (18:27 - 18:30)
yeah maybe when battle styles comes out (18:27 - 18:31)
people will be (18:30 - 18:34)
less excited but that's not until march (18:31 - 18:36)
well since it won't have a charizard or (18:34 - 18:38)
a pikachu (18:36 - 18:40)
yes yeah no charizard nor pikachu i (18:38 - 18:42)
think the best card in battle styles is (18:40 - 18:44)
like a secret rare hershey food card (18:42 - 18:47)
and there's no way like the uh hershey (18:44 - 18:48)
food just doesn't (18:47 - 18:51)
hold a candle to charizard or pikachu (18:48 - 18:53)
it's not a gen 1 pokemon dude (18:51 - 18:56)
okay more crossovers uh this is off um (18:53 - 18:57)

fashion yes yes so like i see like a (21:18 - 21:23)

the secret (21:36 - 21:39)
that i i will reveal this to you the (21:37 - 21:41)
fundamental secret of korean fashion and (21:39 - 21:42)
why it looks so good (21:41 - 21:45)
is the backdrop of seoul being such an (21:42 - 21:47)
amazing and beautiful city (21:45 - 21:49)
yeah that you can wear cool funky (21:47 - 21:50)
clothes there you can't (21:49 - 21:53)
do that in any city that starts with and (21:50 - 21:54)
i'm sorry (21:53 - 21:57)
just any city that starts with adam no (21:54 - 21:58)
no (21:57 - 22:02)
yeah this is i mean i mean one (21:58 - 22:05)
one i am gravely disappointed that levi (22:02 - 22:06)
strauss is a gen warner (22:05 - 22:09)
yeah come on i mean they know their (22:06 - 22:10)
target market (22:09 - 22:12)
i kind of want somebody to get me those (22:10 - 22:13)
pants for my birthday though (22:12 - 22:16)
okay when's your birthday again it's (22:13 - 22:17)
coming up (22:16 - 22:20)
i know it's just i look at like this (22:17 - 22:21)
black hoodie (22:20 - 22:23)
which just has a pikachu just literally (22:21 - 22:26)
just stamped a pikachu on the front (22:23 - 22:29)
and it should look so lazy (22:26 - 22:33)
wow i mean it's got but it's dessert too (22:29 - 22:36)
yeah well the black that's not a hoodie (22:33 - 22:37)
bud that's just a regular (22:36 - 22:40)
sweat sorry yeah the sweater sweatshirt (22:37 - 22:42)
it's a sweatshirt i like it because it (22:40 - 22:44)
doesn't have a hood but the big pokemon (22:42 - 22:46)
on the back and the thing in the front (22:44 - 22:48)
i mean i mean so they have a closer (22:46 - 22:49)
picture it looks like the (22:48 - 22:51)
the pikachu in the front is slightly (22:49 - 22:54)
raised which just presents cleaning (22:51 - 22:56)
problems (22:54 - 22:57)
it's like the when we used to do like (22:56 - 23:00)
the puff ink yeah (22:57 - 23:02)
i mean you know like four washes in (23:00 - 23:04)
pikachu is cracked (23:02 - 23:06)
down the middle that smile is like a (23:04 - 23:07)
jagger (23:06 - 23:09)
joker thing that's going to the cheeks (23:07 - 23:11)
but what about the t-shirt with like the (23:09 - 23:14)
sleepy pikachu on top of the levi's logo (23:11 - 23:15)
that one's pretty okay (23:14 - 23:18)
yeah it is where oh yeah that was kind (23:15 - 23:19)
of cute (23:18 - 23:21)
here's the thing the fact the the fact (23:19 - 23:22)
that they're showing (23:21 - 23:25)
a small version of it and i don't see it (23:22 - 23:27)
on their adult models makes me think (23:25 - 23:30)
it's a kids version because the only (23:27 - 23:31)
other model that seems to have it (23:30 - 23:34)
is a a very thin woman wearing it as a (23:31 - 23:35)
crop top (23:34 - 23:38)
and i am none of those things yeah (23:35 - 23:39)
[Music] (23:38 - 23:42)
i do love me some levi's and i really (23:39 - 23:43)
hate the light blue they did for those (23:42 - 23:44)
pikachu jeans (23:43 - 23:46)
uh the beanie is probably the best item (23:44 - 23:48)
the beanie is the best item (23:46 - 23:50)
yeah light blue jeans are kind of out (23:48 - 23:51)
yeah i mean (23:50 - 23:53)
they're really really like a look that (23:51 - 23:54)
you got to be (23:53 - 23:56)
ready to commit to i have a pair of (23:54 - 23:57)
light blue 501s (23:56 - 24:00)
but that's my like when i'm feeling like (23:57 - 24:01)
a soccer mom (24:00 - 24:03)
that's what goes on it doesn't even (24:01 - 24:05)
state in this article if this is (24:03 - 24:07)
raw denim or what do you think it's (24:05 - 24:09)
actually the advice you think is (24:07 - 24:12)
not doing no raw denim (24:09 - 24:12)
um but yeah not not off do you think not (24:13 - 24:16)
every day (24:16 - 24:19)
that they are going to use raw denim and (24:16 - 24:19)
paint (24:19 - 24:23)
that green garden scene on it i i can (24:19 - 24:25)
take you down some dark alleys of the (24:23 - 24:26)
world of raw depth no (24:25 - 24:28)
yeah no thank you um the secret though (24:26 - 24:31)
is uh raw denim will always be a dark (24:28 - 24:32)
indigo it wouldn't be light blue like (24:31 - 24:34)
that because how are you going to get (24:32 - 24:35)
sick fades (24:34 - 24:37)
on something that's already faded that's (24:35 - 24:39)
already faded (24:37 - 24:42)
i'm sure there's some white blue like (24:39 - 24:42)
egyptian (24:42 - 24:45)
cotton or something that some company is (24:42 - 24:46)
peddling (24:45 - 24:48)
i mean i live in the world of raw denim (24:46 - 24:50)
i haven't seen it yet but hey i've been (24:48 - 24:52)
living in the world of raw denim for 10 (24:50 - 24:53)
years (24:52 - 24:55)
you did it wrong you you two need to (24:53 - 24:57)
start your raw denim podcast (24:55 - 24:59)
and get out of this one wouldn't be (24:57 - 25:01)
surprised if there was already like 17 (24:59 - 25:02)
of them (25:01 - 25:04)
see this is the thing though and this is (25:02 - 25:05)
like the eternal mystery of the universe (25:04 - 25:06)
that if (25:05 - 25:08)
steve and i did do a raw denim podcast (25:06 - 25:10)
that would be like the core (25:08 - 25:12)
inability to see eye to eye that would (25:10 - 25:13)
keep the podcast going (25:12 - 25:17)
is that steve always wants everything (25:13 - 25:20)
to be like in really good condition (25:17 - 25:24)
like like always like well taken care of (25:20 - 25:26)
you know it doesn't ever want anything (25:24 - 25:29)
to go the concept of raw denim (25:26 - 25:31)
is that you just wear it and get it (25:29 - 25:32)
beaten up and (25:31 - 25:34)
that the fades and the cracks and (25:32 - 25:36)
everything like that so it gets (25:34 - 25:37)
discolored over time to show (25:36 - 25:40)
like your person and it's like these two (25:37 - 25:41)
things don't go together (25:40 - 25:43)
raw denim a lot of work there are a (25:41 - 25:46)
surprising amount of denim podcasts (25:43 - 25:49)
yeah if there's a subreddit too there's (25:46 - 25:50)
a dedicated like you know how you have (25:49 - 25:51)
like (25:50 - 25:53)
dedicated tech websites there are (25:51 - 25:54)
dedicated (25:53 - 25:57)
raw denim websites this is almost as bad (25:54 - 25:58)

he would (26:14 - 26:18)

i don't plan on it here's the thing if (26:18 - 26:22)

and then if you don't want to watch the (28:41 - 28:44)
youtube video there is (28:43 - 28:48)
a a whole article on how to do it (28:44 - 28:49)
so just a quick request for (28:48 - 28:51)
clarification did you say (28:49 - 28:53)
building a search engine am i getting a (28:51 - 28:56)
google or a bing out of this (28:53 - 28:59)
that is what it said yes i don't think (28:56 - 29:00)
that's what they meant (28:59 - 29:02)
ah you you know you need a search (29:00 - 29:05)
mechanic in your deck to find your cards (29:02 - 29:08)
oh but not a google or a bing probably (29:05 - 29:08)
not (29:08 - 29:11)
and ask jeeves maybe let me just make (29:08 - 29:12)
sure i read that right (29:11 - 29:15)
yeah no it says building a search engine (29:12 - 29:17)
yeah (29:15 - 29:19)
i don't understand what that me i mean (29:17 - 29:20)
i've been staring at it since you (29:19 - 29:22)
said it's an engine for searching out (29:20 - 29:24)
cards that you need (29:22 - 29:27)
yeah like did denney or professors (29:24 - 29:28)
research (29:27 - 29:30)
quick ball pokemon communication (29:28 - 29:32)
stabilize (29:30 - 29:34)
like we used to have in the old days are (29:32 - 29:36)
they talking about a search engine (29:34 - 29:38)
that allows you to search through your (29:36 - 29:41)
deck probably deck or discard yeah (29:38 - 29:44)
i see curious of how long this (29:41 - 29:47)
series is going to go comments seem good (29:44 - 29:49)
on the youtube video actually (29:47 - 29:51)
well they probably edit their comments (29:49 - 29:52)
yeah there's only one episode (29:51 - 29:56)
i'd say max 10 min 6. (29:52 - 29:59)
10 seems right 10 feels right i don't (29:56 - 30:01)
know because for their podcast they only (29:59 - 30:02)
did like (30:01 - 30:05)
five yeah but podcast is hard (30:02 - 30:08)
podcasting is very hard it's the hardest (30:05 - 30:08)
job (30:08 - 30:10)
ever i have to get a blood transfusion (30:08 - 30:13)
after every time i record one of these (30:10 - 30:16)
by the time this uh podcast goes up (30:13 - 30:18)
there should still be some time left (30:16 - 30:20)
because this event was a little (30:18 - 30:21)
different than past events but (30:20 - 30:24)
there was a promoted raid weekend in (30:21 - 30:25)
sword and shield for (30:24 - 30:28)
cramerant to celebrate the movie that (30:25 - 30:31)
came out in japan over a month ago and (30:28 - 30:31)
has (30:31 - 30:36)
no announcement in any other country (30:31 - 30:39)
but from february 3rd from 4 pm pst to (30:36 - 30:41)
february 8th (30:39 - 30:44)
to 4 pm pst you participate in max (30:41 - 30:46)
pokemon sword and shield max raid (30:44 - 30:48)
battles to earn prizes (30:46 - 30:49)
i made a helpful graphic over the (30:48 - 30:52)
weekend for this kramer ant and a bunch (30:49 - 30:54)
of other pokemon will be appearing (30:52 - 30:56)
and you can earn incredible gifts i (30:54 - 30:58)
don't necessarily (30:56 - 31:01)
agree with the the term incredible gifts (30:58 - 31:03)
participate in as many cramer ant raids (31:01 - 31:04)
as possible the number of kramer ant (31:03 - 31:06)
that the trainers defeat around the (31:04 - 31:07)
world within a time frame will determine (31:06 - 31:09)
awesome prizes for everyone (31:07 - 31:11)
again awesome prizes there's a big (31:09 - 31:13)
asterisk there if trainers collectively (31:11 - 31:15)
defeat kramer at more than 500 (31:13 - 31:17)
000 times players will receive one flame (31:15 - 31:18)
orb one toxic (31:17 - 31:20)
orb and one light bulb are they bringing (31:18 - 31:22)
this whole thing back (31:20 - 31:24)
again of we got to get everybody to do (31:22 - 31:25)
the same thing yeah (31:24 - 31:28)
yeah didn't learn their lesson so (31:25 - 31:32)
i yeah i guess like people got the game (31:28 - 31:33)
for christmas (31:32 - 31:35)
maybe they're missing out on flame or (31:33 - 31:37)
toxic or light bulb i suppose (31:35 - 31:39)
well i i certainly know people are (31:37 - 31:40)
cramming it up (31:39 - 31:43)
oh people are cramming if traders defeat (31:40 - 31:45)
kramer at more than 1 million times (31:43 - 31:46)
players will receive (31:45 - 31:49)
one golden bottle cap three bottle caps (31:46 - 31:50)
and three (31:49 - 31:52)
pearl strings all the prizes will be (31:50 - 31:54)
delivered to mystery gift (31:52 - 31:57)
items so if i have four people (31:54 - 32:00)
on my team does that count as four (31:57 - 32:01)
cremerant defeats or (32:00 - 32:04)
one crammer and defeat i don't know (32:01 - 32:06)
these are the critical questions told (32:04 - 32:09)
anybody there they did tweet that like (32:06 - 32:13)
as of friday night there was 530 (32:09 - 32:15)
000 cramer ants defeated or something (32:13 - 32:16)
like that this is the second time (32:15 - 32:17)
they've done this (32:16 - 32:18)
because the first time they did this (32:17 - 32:20)
with was with zara aura (32:18 - 32:24)
50 as a 15 hour ago play pokemon (32:20 - 32:27)
said together we have defeated (32:24 - 32:30)
hundred and seventy oh thousand one (32:27 - 32:32)
hundred and two wins (32:30 - 32:35)
as of two five so we have to get to a (32:32 - 32:35)
million (32:35 - 32:38)
so seems doable right yeah (32:35 - 32:40)
oh yeah because it's the it's it's now (32:38 - 32:42)
saturday and sunday that people (32:40 - 32:44)
got that was the zero aura thing too (32:42 - 32:45)
when saturday and sunday came those (32:44 - 32:46)
numbers skyrocketed (32:45 - 32:48)
so unlike the other like greed and (32:46 - 32:49)
clefable (32:48 - 32:52)
whale mer event wailord events this (32:49 - 32:54)
started on wednesday night not a (32:52 - 32:55)
thursday night (32:54 - 32:57)
and instead of ending on sunday night (32:55 - 32:59)
it's ending on monday night so they (32:57 - 32:59)
added (32:59 - 33:03)
an extra day two days two days (32:59 - 33:06)
two days which i feel like feels better (33:03 - 33:08)
yes because it's so good i feel like it (33:06 - 33:11)
should always end sometime on a monday (33:08 - 33:13)
yeah i agree because some people might (33:11 - 33:15)
not be able to play games until sunday (33:13 - 33:16)
night and these events were (33:15 - 33:19)
ending sunday afternoon right (33:16 - 33:21)
i feel like a monday morning cut off (33:19 - 33:23)
when they have to go to school is a good (33:21 - 33:23)
idea (33:23 - 33:25)
uh no monday evening is good because if (33:23 - 33:27)
what if i got like (33:25 - 33:30)
grounded for the weekend because let's (33:27 - 33:31)
say (33:30 - 33:33)
i i don't know threw a rock through a (33:31 - 33:34)
window or something (33:33 - 33:36)
you ripped your rod william did you (33:34 - 33:39)
throw a rock through that window (33:36 - 33:41)
for ripping your raw denim and yes i did (33:39 - 33:43)
throw a rock through a window when i was (33:41 - 33:44)
like four years old (33:43 - 33:46)
uh but then it gives you all day monday (33:44 - 33:48)
after you get your switch back (33:46 - 33:50)
to actually do a couple crammer at raids (33:48 - 33:51)
and from what i've seen most people can (33:50 - 33:53)
get like two in a day (33:51 - 33:55)
two shiny ones in a day i've got none in (33:53 - 33:56)
a day (33:55 - 33:58)
yeah i've played two full days i've only (33:56 - 34:01)
gotten two (33:58 - 34:02)
maybe you guys just know the wrong (34:01 - 34:04)
people i mean that's valid (34:02 - 34:06)
it's because you're you guys are goody (34:04 - 34:07)
two shoes and you don't throw rocks (34:06 - 34:08)
through windows (34:07 - 34:11)
so that's why you're just not blessed (34:08 - 34:13)
with the creme or shiny crammer at luck (34:11 - 34:17)
true i can't even say words anymore (34:13 - 34:20)
i what who's who's picking these rewards (34:17 - 34:23)
who who at game freak or the pokemon (34:20 - 34:24)
company (34:23 - 34:26)
was like yes do you know what will get (34:24 - 34:28)
people to come back to this game do you (34:26 - 34:30)
know what will finally get people (34:28 - 34:33)
off their seats turn on the game excited (34:30 - 34:35)
a flame orb a toxic orbital light ball (34:33 - 34:38)
what kind of rewards are these i mean (34:35 - 34:40)
those are very popular (34:38 - 34:43)
uh competitive pokemon items (34:40 - 34:45)
if you're in a competitive pokemon you (34:43 - 34:46)
didn't wait a year and a half (34:45 - 34:49)
into this game cycle to finally pick up (34:46 - 34:50)
the game and try it (34:49 - 34:52)
a year and a half ago i was 12 and i (34:50 - 34:54)
wasn't allowed to go on the internet (34:52 - 34:55)
according to (34:54 - 34:59)
sbj now i'm 13. i can go on the internet (34:55 - 35:02)
and do online competition type things (34:59 - 35:04)
also at one point in time like i would (35:02 - 35:06)
be like yeah golden bottle cap (35:04 - 35:08)
rocks three bottle caps that's that's (35:06 - 35:10)
those are good rewards but (35:08 - 35:12)
the digging duo people give you bottle (35:10 - 35:13)
caps (35:12 - 35:16)
like bottled water they're just here (35:13 - 35:18)
here you go we have so many of them i (35:16 - 35:19)
think the (35:18 - 35:22)
event is fine these events are (35:19 - 35:26)
fun to do a bunch of raids with people (35:22 - 35:28)
turn on the game once a once a month if (35:26 - 35:30)
you've stepped away to (35:28 - 35:33)
try to find a shiny but these rewards (35:30 - 35:33)
are (35:33 - 35:36)
really lackluster the problem the (35:33 - 35:36)
problem is (35:36 - 35:39)
is you are the pokemon equivalent of (35:36 - 35:40)
bougie (35:39 - 35:43)
where you're like i've got like six (35:40 - 35:44)
flame orbs (35:43 - 35:46)
and eighteen light balls and oh my i've (35:44 - 35:49)
got so many bugs i had lights (35:46 - 35:52)
before it was cool us regular pokemon (35:49 - 35:52)
players who (35:52 - 35:55)
don't play pokemon every night of the (35:52 - 35:57)
week we we don't have your fabulous (35:55 - 35:58)
riches (35:57 - 36:00)
my friend and i will take whatever flame (35:58 - 36:02)
or light ball whatever (36:00 - 36:05)
i can get okay (36:02 - 36:05)
your artisanal bottle caps let me bring (36:05 - 36:10)
up regular old bottle caps (36:08 - 36:13)
from our coca-cola bottles i know he's (36:10 - 36:14)
he's got like (36:13 - 36:16)
the his is like that he's like that (36:14 - 36:17)
weird kraft (36:16 - 36:21)
jones soda special edition cranberry and (36:17 - 36:22)
turkey (36:21 - 36:25)
yeah and i'm rc cola heck yeah let me (36:22 - 36:26)
bring up this situation (36:25 - 36:29)
a year ago (36:26 - 36:29)
they they did bulbasaur charmander and (36:30 - 36:34)
squirtle raids (36:32 - 36:38)
for very easy raids and they were (36:34 - 36:41)
those a single squirtle were was (36:38 - 36:43)
dropping toxic orbs and if you just kept (36:41 - 36:45)
doing squirtles you'd be loaded on toxic (36:43 - 36:46)
orbs (36:45 - 36:49)
so now you're saying a year later we as (36:46 - 36:50)
a community have to defeat a half a (36:49 - 36:52)
million crimes for just (36:50 - 36:55)
one measly toxic and flame orb look a (36:52 - 36:56)
year ago (36:55 - 36:58)
i hadn't gotten sword and shield for (36:56 - 36:59)
christmas yet yeah (36:58 - 37:03)
a year ago we had a huge supply of toxic (36:59 - 37:03)
orbs (37:03 - 37:06)
the supply has dwindled because we gave (37:03 - 37:07)
them out like candy (37:06 - 37:10)
oh i see so now we have a lot less (37:07 - 37:14)
toxic orbs in storage so we can't just (37:10 - 37:16)
be handing them out like candy (37:14 - 37:18)
yeah we got to replenish the supply yeah (37:16 - 37:19)
this this is okay (37:18 - 37:22)
so this is still like an ongoing problem (37:19 - 37:25)
with this company though (37:22 - 37:27)
it's like the sun and moon and ultra sun (37:25 - 37:28)
and moon thing (37:27 - 37:30)
where they're like we need you to hatch (37:28 - 37:32)
one million eggs trainers for (37:30 - 37:35)
like one measly single bottle cap for (37:32 - 37:36)
the reward (37:35 - 37:39)
like they want us to come together and (37:36 - 37:40)
do these things (37:39 - 37:43)
but the but the but the rewards are so (37:40 - 37:46)
mediocre and then who is sitting on the (37:43 - 37:47)
other end (37:46 - 37:49)
there there's like probably like two (37:47 - 37:51)
japanese dudes one named bob one named (37:49 - 37:52)
joe (37:51 - 37:54)
and bob is like we need the rewards to (37:52 - 37:55)
be better and joe was like no these are (37:54 - 37:57)
rewards are good enough and then when (37:55 - 37:59)
when we fail these events like we did (37:57 - 38:01)
well we we're not going to fail this (37:59 - 38:02)
kramer on but when we failed all these (38:01 - 38:04)
events in ultrasound ultramoon do you (38:02 - 38:05)
think they just (38:04 - 38:07)
the one looks at each other and says (38:05 - 38:08)
like i told you so the other guy goes (38:07 - 38:12)
i don't know i thought one single uh (38:08 - 38:14)
lepeberry was good enough like this (38:12 - 38:15)
isn't this (38:14 - 38:17)
it's not no you're you're so completely (38:15 - 38:19)
wrong what (38:17 - 38:22)
what the problem is is they're stuck (38:19 - 38:26)
it's it's rocking a hard place they (38:22 - 38:29)
they can't give out no reward because (38:26 - 38:31)
then everybody's gonna complain well why (38:29 - 38:32)
are they having us do this event if (38:31 - 38:34)
there's no rewards for it i can't be (38:32 - 38:35)
bothered but (38:34 - 38:36)
shiny crammer rant that's a crummy (38:35 - 38:38)
pokemon anyways (38:36 - 38:40)
they can't give out a fantastic reward (38:38 - 38:42)
because that would be game breaking (38:40 - 38:44)
no so they're like let's let me look (38:42 - 38:46)
back in this this rummage box we have of (38:44 - 38:47)
like (38:46 - 38:50)
2019's fabulous pokemon okay yeah we got (38:47 - 38:51)
a couple of (38:50 - 38:53)
the light balls and toxic yeah we'll (38:51 - 38:55)
just throw them in cool (38:53 - 38:58)
it's not like they have a warehouse full (38:55 - 39:01)
of toxic worms and they're like (38:58 - 39:01)
don't understand how technology works (39:02 - 39:05)
yes (39:04 - 39:07)
there's a limited supply of these (39:05 - 39:08)
digital items (39:07 - 39:10)
this this would be my one million reward (39:08 - 39:12)
and i i think it's it (39:10 - 39:14)
it's just taking what they did and made (39:12 - 39:15)
it better it should be three golden (39:14 - 39:16)
bottle caps (39:15 - 39:19)
10 regular bottle caps and like 10 pearl (39:16 - 39:20)
strings (39:19 - 39:22)
that feels substantial now you're (39:20 - 39:23)
thinking in a competitive sense i can (39:22 - 39:25)
get through only three pokemon (39:23 - 39:28)
max ivs that's not a lot especially when (39:25 - 39:30)
the format's changing every three months (39:28 - 39:31)
and you're you're (39:30 - 39:33)
you're changing your team that's that's (39:31 - 39:35)
giving an option to (39:33 - 39:38)
uh max iv three of your pokemon 10 (39:35 - 39:41)
regular bottle caps will let you max out (39:38 - 39:43)
two more of your pokemon you need six (39:41 - 39:44)
pokemon on a team (39:43 - 39:48)
and ten pearl strings gives you at least (39:44 - 39:51)
some chance of purchasing vitamins if (39:48 - 39:52)
you wanted to purchase vitamins (39:51 - 39:56)
to not do the old way three (39:52 - 39:58)
purl strings is is like nothing you (39:56 - 39:59)
could just remember (39:58 - 40:01)
what a purl string is the purse string (39:59 - 40:02)
is just like (40:01 - 40:05)
it's like purl into it's like pearl big (40:02 - 40:07)
pearl and then purl string (40:05 - 40:10)
um i think a pearl is like 1200 and a (40:07 - 40:12)
big pearl is like 2 000 and a pull (40:10 - 40:13)
string is like 3 (40:12 - 40:16)
500 or something like that i'm probably (40:13 - 40:17)
slightly off on those numbers (40:16 - 40:19)
somebody in their car is raging that i (40:17 - 40:21)
didn't know the cost of pearl string off (40:19 - 40:22)
the top of my head (40:21 - 40:25)
but but i know for sure if you ran the (40:22 - 40:27)
champions cup which takes less than five (40:25 - 40:29)
like less than five or six minutes (40:27 - 40:30)
because you only have to defeat three (40:29 - 40:31)
trainers (40:30 - 40:34)
whatever like alistair bead and leon (40:31 - 40:35)
that's more money than three pearl (40:34 - 40:39)
strings i have no answers for you (40:35 - 40:40)
send your complaints to complaints at (40:39 - 40:43)
pokemon.com there's so many items in (40:40 - 40:44)
pokemon that (40:43 - 40:47)
are easy to get but also (40:44 - 40:50)
easy to like get rid of like yeah you (40:47 - 40:51)
can give me (40:50 - 40:54)
10 nuggets and i can cash those in and (40:51 - 40:56)
spend them instantly on like (40:54 - 40:58)
25 vitamins and now it's gone but that (40:56 - 41:00)
is right you're not getting 10 nuggets (40:58 - 41:01)
on the dollar menu (41:00 - 41:04)
no you're not that's still helpful so (41:01 - 41:05)
pearl string is 10 (41:04 - 41:07)
000. yeah so that's that's thirty (41:05 - 41:08)
thousand dollars when you defeat (41:07 - 41:10)
one trainer in a champions cup battle (41:08 - 41:12)
you walk away with twenty two thousand (41:10 - 41:13)
so by doing champions cup with like (41:12 - 41:15)
amulet coin you walk away with (41:13 - 41:17)
like seventy five thousand because it's (41:15 - 41:19)
like 22 22 and then the last one is (41:17 - 41:21)
usually like 32 i think (41:19 - 41:23)
i just think that the rewards should be (41:21 - 41:25)
better it's a problem i can't solve for (41:23 - 41:26)
you (41:25 - 41:28)
well here's the thing you need to write (41:26 - 41:29)
to my uncle (41:28 - 41:33)
in nintendo and state your case simple (41:29 - 41:35)
yeah be the change you want to see in (41:33 - 41:37)
the world steve (41:35 - 41:40)
or don't sit here behind your microphone (41:37 - 41:42)
pretending that you're going to do (41:40 - 41:44)
something be the change (41:42 - 41:46)
i would literally want this event to (41:44 - 41:47)
fail (41:46 - 41:50)
just to show games almost at gamestop (41:47 - 41:51)
just to go (41:50 - 41:54)
show game freak wow that these rewards (41:51 - 41:57)
are very mediocre and not great (41:54 - 41:59)
it's not going to happen because people (41:57 - 42:01)
like you pumped up kramer ant as some (41:59 - 42:02)
sort of (42:01 - 42:05)
fantastic pokemon to be chased and now (42:02 - 42:06)
everybody's like i got to get the (42:05 - 42:09)
crammer ant (42:06 - 42:09)
we're going to run out of cramer ants (42:09 - 42:11)
that's what's going to happen yeah i (42:10 - 42:13)
mean people are doing the cramer ants (42:11 - 42:14)
probably because they want the shiny (42:13 - 42:14)
cramer (42:14 - 42:16)
not necessarily because they're like so (42:14 - 42:19)
desperate for one golden bottle cap (42:16 - 42:21)
you know what was the real reward bottle (42:19 - 42:23)
cap friendships that we made along the (42:21 - 42:24)
way (42:23 - 42:27)
police arrest sword and shield hacker (42:24 - 42:29)
for selling shiny pokemon (42:27 - 42:33)
he made over he made over ten thousand (42:29 - 42:33)
dollars (42:33 - 42:36)
selling pokemon saved files this is off (42:33 - 42:37)
polygon.com (42:36 - 42:41)
oh this is insane japanese authorities (42:37 - 42:43)
have arrested a 23 year old man who is (42:41 - 42:45)
charged with hacking and selling (42:43 - 42:47)
save data for pokemon sword and shield (42:45 - 42:49)
according to a report from a japanese (42:47 - 42:50)
newspaper (42:49 - 42:54)
shimbun via serebii police say (42:50 - 42:56)
the man earned about ten thousand ten (42:54 - 42:57)
thousand (42:56 - 42:58)
nine hundred dollars from altering and (42:57 - 43:01)
selling copies of sword and shield (42:58 - 43:04)
the man reportedly sold a hacked sabble (43:01 - 43:06)
last april and received four thousand (43:04 - 43:08)
four hundred yen (43:06 - 43:10)
around forty one dollars for it the (43:08 - 43:11)
suspect (43:10 - 43:14)
admitted to the charges pokemon company (43:11 - 43:16)
crackdown on pokemon hackers in january (43:14 - 43:17)
the company put out a (43:16 - 43:20)
illegal modified data on notice that was (43:17 - 43:21)
in pokemon home (43:20 - 43:23)
the company the pokemon company said it (43:21 - 43:25)
would penalize cheating players by (43:23 - 43:28)
limiting features like access to home (43:25 - 43:30)
pokemon hackers have been testing the (43:28 - 43:31)
limits of what they could get away with (43:30 - 43:32)
for years (43:31 - 43:35)
a company banned a wave of cheaters in (43:32 - 43:37)
pokemon sun and moon online services (43:35 - 43:38)
back in 2017 (43:37 - 43:41)
there are no current details on what the (43:38 - 43:42)
fine or (43:41 - 43:44)
additional punishes will be but under (43:42 - 43:45)
japan but (43:44 - 43:48)
under japan's unfair competition (43:45 - 43:49)
protection law (43:48 - 43:51)
the editing and distribution of save (43:49 - 43:54)
data is illegal (43:51 - 43:57)
okay so she she's linking that uh (43:54 - 43:58)
players were banned from the global link (43:57 - 44:02)
illegal um so yeah yeah okay (43:58 - 44:03)
this is a different ban we're thinking (44:02 - 44:05)
of two different bands um there were a (44:03 - 44:06)
bunch of people who (44:05 - 44:08)
downloaded sun and moon early from a rom (44:06 - 44:10)
website i think it was like a mexican (44:08 - 44:13)
website uh or maybe it was australian oh (44:10 - 44:15)
australia how could you (44:13 - 44:20)
those people got their ds's bricked (44:15 - 44:21)
which means they could still play their (44:20 - 44:23)
ds but (44:21 - 44:26)
they couldn't go online with any game (44:23 - 44:29)
uh for downloading sun and moon early (44:26 - 44:30)
and they again they didn't download it (44:29 - 44:33)
early sorry they installed (44:30 - 44:37)
a rom dump on their ds to play it early (44:33 - 44:40)
the i don't know too much about japan's (44:37 - 44:42)
unfair competition protection law i do (44:40 - 44:43)
know that (44:42 - 44:46)
to modify your save data is technically (44:43 - 44:47)
illegal (44:46 - 44:50)
i also know that modifying (44:47 - 44:53)
hardware became illegal in japan (44:50 - 44:56)
uh which there were there was a japanese (44:53 - 44:57)
company (44:56 - 45:00)
called the katsu kitty and what they (44:57 - 45:01)
would do is they would take places (45:00 - 45:03)
they would take like playstation vitas (45:01 - 45:06)
where they would take nintendo 3dss (45:03 - 45:07)
and they were even doing that with the (45:06 - 45:09)
nintendo switch and they would modify (45:07 - 45:10)
the hardware (45:09 - 45:13)
to put a video out on on that hardware (45:10 - 45:15)
that's why a lot of streamers (45:13 - 45:18)
are able to capture like their 3ds um i (45:15 - 45:20)
was gonna say that's why you see some (45:18 - 45:21)
streamers capture (45:20 - 45:22)
from their playstation vita but (45:21 - 45:24)
literally no one is doing that because (45:22 - 45:24)
there was no good games in the (45:24 - 45:26)
playstation vita (45:24 - 45:29)
would you don't you start you only say (45:26 - 45:30)
that to aggravate me (45:29 - 45:36)
i love my vita still in boston isn't it (45:30 - 45:39)
yes so when that law passed (45:36 - 45:41)
uh katsu kitty just closed up shop that (45:39 - 45:42)
day and (45:41 - 45:45)
stopped making 3ds capture cards i'm (45:42 - 45:47)
sure they were making plenty of money (45:45 - 45:51)
from making buying a 3ds opening it up (45:47 - 45:53)
modifying it and then selling it for 200 (45:51 - 45:54)
more but i (45:53 - 45:57)
i i guess the the more interesting part (45:54 - 45:59)
of the story is like (45:57 - 46:01)
how how did he get caught well i mean (45:59 - 46:04)
did somebody report him (46:01 - 46:08)
inside sting but (46:04 - 46:10)
you know there was a stakeout online (46:08 - 46:11)
this is going to be will and i's new (46:10 - 46:15)
youtube series uh pokemon cops where we (46:11 - 46:19)
uh stake out known hacking dens (46:15 - 46:21)
waiting to see the transfer go through (46:19 - 46:22)
and then we'll (46:21 - 46:24)
but we capture all sorts of pokemon (46:22 - 46:27)
criminals it's not just people who (46:24 - 46:29)
you know hack pokemon and try to sell (46:27 - 46:31)
them on who is buying (46:29 - 46:34)
digital pokemon online oh just get on (46:31 - 46:37)
discord i'm sure (46:34 - 46:40)
sigh we will capture other pokemon (46:37 - 46:41)
criminals (46:40 - 46:44)
like the person who is (46:41 - 46:48)
buying 11 boxes of champions at target (46:44 - 46:50)
when they're only supposed to buy 10. (46:48 - 46:52)
i mean the the gist here is like the (46:50 - 46:54)
pokemon company wasn't really involved (46:52 - 46:54)
here (46:54 - 46:58)
it was it was just japanese police (46:54 - 47:02)
i i just i still it what hurts my mind (46:58 - 47:04)
is number one that there is a human (47:02 - 47:06)
being out there that said (47:04 - 47:09)
i'm going to make fake pokemon and sell (47:06 - 47:11)
them (47:09 - 47:14)
and ten thousand dollars worth of people (47:11 - 47:15)
out in the world (47:14 - 47:18)
said i'm going to buy this (47:15 - 47:22)
digital pokemon that if i gave it (47:18 - 47:24)
three minutes worth of thought i would (47:22 - 47:25)
realize is fake (47:24 - 47:27)
it's so weird cause like we i have this (47:25 - 47:29)
conversation all the time (47:27 - 47:32)
on like twitch where like somebody will (47:29 - 47:33)
come in (47:32 - 47:36)
probably like younger and they'll be (47:33 - 47:37)
like (47:36 - 47:39)
why why are you shiny hunting why don't (47:37 - 47:41)
you just (47:39 - 47:44)
go to like folks lab or pk hex a shiny (47:41 - 47:46)
and you'll be done in like five minutes (47:44 - 47:47)
which is like (47:46 - 47:50)
true like they're not wrong (47:47 - 47:52)
for being like you know you could just (47:50 - 47:53)
pk hex (47:52 - 47:56)
a shiny and you're like right like i (47:53 - 47:57)
could i could go to ebay and i could (47:56 - 47:59)
probably find (47:57 - 48:02)
sword and shield all shiny pokemon (47:59 - 48:05)
plus 999 master balls for like 60 bucks (48:02 - 48:06)
on ebay i'm sure that (48:05 - 48:08)
exists because it existed for sun and (48:06 - 48:10)
moon and existed for ultra sun and moon (48:08 - 48:13)
and you're right for like a pretty low (48:10 - 48:14)
cost i could just (48:13 - 48:17)
buy the entire thing but and but people (48:14 - 48:17)
do (48:17 - 48:20)
buy those that's why they're being sold (48:17 - 48:22)
because somebody is buying that kind of (48:20 - 48:22)
stuff (48:22 - 48:24)
i don't know who those people are but in (48:22 - 48:26)
my in my brain (48:24 - 48:29)
the the same people buying the same (48:26 - 48:30)
people buying (48:29 - 48:33)
uh complete ultrasound ultramoon every (48:30 - 48:35)
single shiny 99 master balls (48:33 - 48:36)
are probably the same people who are (48:35 - 48:39)
like buying used bowling trophies off (48:36 - 48:39)
ebay (48:39 - 48:41)
and then like putting them on like their (48:39 - 48:43)
fireplace so when their friends come (48:41 - 48:44)
over because people (48:43 - 48:47)
do exist i know so if their friends come (48:44 - 48:48)
over they could be like look at all (48:47 - 48:48)
these (48:48 - 48:50)
bowling trophies i won and you could be (48:48 - 48:52)
like i've never seen you bowl will and (48:50 - 48:53)
it's like well you know (48:52 - 48:56)
i'm retired i won so many matches i (48:53 - 48:59)
i can't pop my can't possibly bowl (48:56 - 49:01)
anymore (48:59 - 49:03)
like and then at the very core of that (49:01 - 49:05)
thought process of like (49:03 - 49:08)
if you're buying all shinies all master (49:05 - 49:09)
balls or if you're buying a bowling (49:08 - 49:12)
trophy or if you're buying like a (49:09 - 49:14)
what other weird things that people are (49:12 - 49:16)
buying like you're probably just a bad (49:14 - 49:16)
person (49:16 - 49:18)
i can't think of any in any situation (49:16 - 49:20)
where you're like (49:18 - 49:23)
i need to buy a first place winning (49:20 - 49:24)
bowling trophy to display it somewhere (49:23 - 49:26)
in my house why are you doing that (49:24 - 49:28)
because when your friends come over and (49:26 - 49:31)
they go like wow will i didn't know you (49:28 - 49:34)
you won a bowling tournament in 1984 and (49:31 - 49:34)
be like yeah (49:34 - 49:36)
i did so at that point if you're saying (49:34 - 49:38)
yeah i did you're lying (49:36 - 49:41)
to your friends uh or you're gonna be (49:38 - 49:41)
like (49:41 - 49:44)
no i actually didn't i bought it on ebay (49:41 - 49:46)
uh you know isn't it funny it's on my (49:44 - 49:48)
fireplace and you're like no it's not (49:46 - 49:50)
funny it sounds like a waste of money (49:48 - 49:53)
why'd you just go bowl bowling is like (49:50 - 49:54)
six dollars (49:53 - 49:56)
what i think it's a little more (49:54 - 49:58)
expensive than six dollars when you have (49:56 - 50:01)
like the nachos and the yeah all that (49:58 - 50:02)
other shoes (50:01 - 50:04)
i do the shoe rental oh you bring your (50:02 - 50:05)
own shoes your own ball (50:04 - 50:09)
do you own a pair of bowling shoes (50:05 - 50:12)
well let me buy the bowling trophy first (50:09 - 50:14)
and it's not like just going to the (50:12 - 50:16)
bowling alley (50:14 - 50:18)
somebody from outback is going to walk (50:16 - 50:19)
forward and say you know what (50:18 - 50:21)
random person who's never been here (50:19 - 50:22)

cards in it (55:12 - 55:15)
how much is a box of cereal like four (55:13 - 55:18)
bucks 350 probably depends on the size (55:15 - 55:21)

cards all of the lucky charms will have (55:21 - 55:26)
it in it cocoa puffs will have it in it (55:23 - 55:28)
reese puffs will have it in it and (55:26 - 55:31)

like tricks (55:33 - 55:36)
though i'd eat tricks for some pokemon (55:34 - 55:37)
cards yeah (55:36 - 55:40)

just go to tcgplayer (55:56 - 56:00)
wait for the pikachu to be posted there (55:59 - 56:02)
order it even though it might be like 10 (56:00 - 56:04)
or 15 (56:02 - 56:07)

worth of cereal so who's buying the (56:07 - 56:11)
bowling trophy now steve (56:09 - 56:13)

they were sitting there with a bowl of (57:16 - 57:20)
cookie crisp put whole milk on it and (57:18 - 57:23)
then actually put two teaspoons of sugar (57:20 - 57:25)
on top of your cookie crisp because it (57:23 - 57:26)
it was not (57:25 - 57:29)
sweet enough it was not we were craving (57:26 - 57:31)
and strawberry cow which would turn your (57:29 - 57:33)
milk into strawberry milk (57:31 - 57:36)
yeah too bad they found that that was (57:33 - 57:37)
radioactive (57:36 - 57:41)
it gave me cancer i didn't (57:37 - 57:41)
that's how you're going to finance your (57:44 - 57:47)
children's college education (57:45 - 57:50)

all right greg question of the week i (57:57 - 58:01)
can't wait to (58:00 - 58:03)
hear you ask ask the question of the (58:01 - 58:05)
week (58:03 - 58:07)
this is from andrew according to (58:05 - 58:08)
lieutenant (58:07 - 58:11)
serge his pokemon saved him during a war (58:08 - 58:13)
which pokemon would you have (58:11 - 58:15)
which pokemon would you have at your (58:13 - 58:17)
side in a pokemon (58:15 - 58:20)
world war scenario i mean as much as i (58:17 - 58:22)
want to say my precious flower (58:20 - 58:26)
that is for peace times i am picking (58:22 - 58:29)
the bolt hund as proven by the crown (58:26 - 58:30)
tundra will chase (58:29 - 58:34)
anybody down no fear by my side (58:30 - 58:36)
i'm the new lieutenant search it's very (58:34 - 58:37)
interesting (58:36 - 58:40)
it really defines your perspective on (58:37 - 58:41)
how you react to (58:40 - 58:43)
your surroundings your environment much (58:41 - 58:44)
in the same way as (58:43 - 58:47)
the uh like if you could have be either (58:44 - 58:49)
have the ability to turn invisible or (58:47 - 58:51)
fly which would you choose and it's like (58:49 - 58:53)
people who turn invisible are creepy (58:51 - 58:55)
because they want to like sneak around (58:53 - 58:56)
and listen to other folks conversations (58:55 - 58:59)
while people who fly are like very brave (58:56 - 59:00)
because they're going to be there's no (58:59 - 59:02)
way to hide that (59:00 - 59:04)
everybody's going to see you fly and (59:02 - 59:05)
greg it's like you're (59:04 - 59:08)
you're a violent warmonger you want to (59:05 - 59:10)
engage in the violence (59:08 - 59:13)
my choice would be an abra because you (59:10 - 59:14)
know what (59:13 - 59:15)
i'm going to teleport out of any (59:14 - 59:17)
dangerous situation the minute (59:15 - 59:20)
the little twitch on somebody's eyelid (59:17 - 59:23)
wiggles i'm out goodbye oh see i was (59:20 - 59:24)

a defensive pokemon like a gallerian (59:24 - 59:28)
surfetch or (59:27 - 59:31)
like a obstagoon well because you want (59:28 - 59:32)
to engage in the violence (59:31 - 59:34)
no i want to protect your back on (59:32 - 59:36)
violence i'm peaceful (59:34 - 59:39)
it's a world war generally those are (59:36 - 59:39)
extreme (59:39 - 59:42)
situations and sitting by the side and (59:39 - 59:44)
doing nothing (59:42 - 59:46)
is allowing fascism to thrive so you're (59:44 - 59:48)
not sitting by the side (59:46 - 59:51)

right last week's pokemon of the week (60:26 - 60:29)
had (60:28 - 60:32)
like 30 useless clues and then one clue (60:29 - 60:33)
that you actually needed to actually (60:32 - 60:34)
solve the (60:33 - 60:36)
puzzle of who was the pokemon of the (60:34 - 60:38)
week but it was basically like (60:36 - 60:40)
think of all of the gen 7 pokemon (60:38 - 60:42)
mythical pokemon of which (60:40 - 60:45)
there were technically five (60:42 - 60:48)
although technically three of them (60:45 - 60:49)
really kind of like are (60:48 - 60:53)
just kind of jammed in there (60:49 - 60:53)
but four of the five their names (60:53 - 61:00)
start with the letter m and one of them (60:57 - 61:02)
does not and the pokemon of the week was (61:00 - 61:04)
the one that doesn't start with the (61:02 - 61:04)
letter (61:04 - 61:09)
m it's (61:04 - 61:09)
chat it's never chat except for one time (61:09 - 61:15)
it does not start with the letter m also (61:12 - 61:16)
not a mythical (61:15 - 61:20)
it's zara aura zara aura the electric (61:16 - 61:26)
kitty cat tony the tiger looking thing (61:20 - 61:26)
that was one of the clues buddy uh one (61:28 - 61:33)
of my favorite (61:31 - 61:35)
monsters to hunt in monster hunter is (61:33 - 61:36)
also an electric (61:35 - 61:38)
kitty cat they never made it into (61:36 - 61:40)
shuffle so (61:38 - 61:43)
um and everybody's seen the shiny (61:40 - 61:45)
because you got one for free (61:43 - 61:47)

picked up a shiny aurora at any point (61:47 - 61:54)
did it (61:50 - 61:54)
oh that's like there's something about (61:54 - 61:59)
pokemon home that i find repulsive (61:57 - 62:02)
and it's a year and it's still bad i (61:59 - 62:04)
just (62:02 - 62:06)
but you remember even when it came out (62:04 - 62:08)
it was like oh i gotta install this (62:06 - 62:11)
i gotta use it i just like i don't know (62:08 - 62:13)
what it is i just i don't want a pokemon (62:11 - 62:14)
home (62:13 - 62:16)
i don't know what it is either it's like (62:14 - 62:18)
when i'm scrolling through pokemon home (62:16 - 62:20)
for scrolling and pokemon go pokemon go (62:18 - 62:22)
like looking at your pokemon and (62:20 - 62:23)
scrolling through just feels like a (62:22 - 62:25)
better experience (62:23 - 62:28)
well i don't even i i always i actually (62:25 - 62:30)
have just now realized i didn't even (62:28 - 62:31)

required for one million players making (63:16 - 63:19)
it the only mythical that could be (63:18 - 63:22)
encountered in max raid battles (63:19 - 63:23)
interesting (63:22 - 63:25)
and pokemon kind of a stretch for a (63:23 - 63:27)
trivia but sure (63:25 - 63:29)
okay hold on i don't know if this is a (63:27 - 63:30)
typo on bubblepedia (63:29 - 63:34)
in pokemon the movie colon the power of (63:30 - 63:34)
us (63:34 - 63:38)
colon zeraora's story (63:34 - 63:42)
i don't sarah is described (63:38 - 63:44)
being born in an explosion called by a (63:42 - 63:45)
lightning (63:44 - 63:48)
bolt striking the mouth of an un (63:45 - 63:50)
erupting volcano (63:48 - 63:54)
i mean that happens a lot oh i see (63:50 - 63:57)
pokemon the movie colon the power of us (63:54 - 63:58)
colon zera aura's (63:57 - 64:01)
story is a tie-in (63:58 - 64:05)
manga adapt uh adaptation ah yes (64:01 - 64:08)
oh i was thinking of going to the source (64:05 - 64:08)
today too (64:08 - 64:12)
i wonder if they have it there oh i (64:08 - 64:13)
doubt it (64:12 - 64:14)
is the source still open greg please (64:13 - 64:16)
tell me the source is still open okay (64:14 - 64:20)
they got a lot of mangas they do (64:16 - 64:22)
but i don't i don't know that they have (64:20 - 64:24)
a huge amount i've never really seen a (64:22 - 64:26)
huge amount of pokemon (64:24 - 64:28)
manga there but i granted i haven't i've (64:26 - 64:30)
seen i haven't looked at very long (64:28 - 64:32)
mangas there are you ready for this (64:30 - 64:34)
week's pokemon of the week (64:32 - 64:38)
born ready fair warning (64:34 - 64:40)
again (64:38 - 64:40)
that was the last that was last week (64:45 - 64:48)
tomorrow (64:48 - 64:52)
sunday february 7th 2021 is a very (64:48 - 64:54)
special day for brent's husband (64:52 - 64:56)
because of the spotlight on a particular (64:54 - 64:57)
pokemon (64:56 - 64:59)
if you consider the first three pokemon (64:57 - 65:01)
types we encounter in most games (64:59 - 65:04)
there is only one pokemon without (65:01 - 65:06)
requiring a hidden ability or being (65:04 - 65:07)
related to a camel (65:06 - 65:09)
that is the exact opposite of this (65:07 - 65:10)
pokemon (65:09 - 65:12)
you may need to consult with an oracle (65:10 - 65:14)
to find the answer (65:12 - 65:18)
look i made it so short nobody can have (65:14 - 65:20)
lost track of the path of that (65:18 - 65:21)
particular clue (65:20 - 65:24)
right there all right well we will be (65:21 - 65:24)
back (65:24 - 65:27)
next week whoa this is the first podcast (65:24 - 65:29)
in a long time we didn't do any pogo (65:27 - 65:29)
news (65:29 - 65:31)
weird i mean i guess they announced (65:29 - 65:32)
everything for february and then we (65:31 - 65:34)
called it a day (65:32 - 65:36)
yeah and the real february events (65:34 - 65:37)
tomorrow so (65:36 - 65:40)
yep yeah rosalia but (65:37 - 65:42)
after this goes up and then i'm sure (65:40 - 65:44)
we'll have plenty of stuff to talk about (65:42 - 65:45)
for (65:44 - 65:46)
you know i do want to mention one thing (65:45 - 65:48)
i do get this a lot during twitch chat i (65:46 - 65:50)
do want to clarify this (65:48 - 65:53)
so the the shiny mew thing and the (65:50 - 65:57)
uh the kanto event uh i do want to (65:53 - 65:58)
clarify this (65:57 - 66:02)
so uh some people are worried that (65:58 - 66:03)
they're gonna spend (66:02 - 66:06)
twelve dollars and not get the mew (66:03 - 66:08)
or some people don't know if they'll (66:06 - 66:09)
have time to do it (66:08 - 66:13)
uh there are two different events (66:09 - 66:16)
and this is what you need to like the (66:13 - 66:18)
kanto event from nine to nine on (66:16 - 66:19)
saturday (66:18 - 66:23)
is not the mew event there there are (66:19 - 66:25)
two different events think of it like (66:23 - 66:27)
pokemon go fest (66:25 - 66:31)
where saturday had the shadow mewtwo (66:27 - 66:32)
event (66:31 - 66:36)
and sunday had the victini event (66:32 - 66:39)
there will probably be overlap (66:36 - 66:40)
in the two different events like for (66:39 - 66:43)
example you might have to catch (66:40 - 66:46)
you know 50 unique pokemon to (66:43 - 66:49)
go to the mew quest line but you need (66:46 - 66:53)
150 to finish the kanto event quest line (66:49 - 66:55)
that being said as long as you pick up (66:53 - 66:57)
the mew quest (66:55 - 67:00)
you will be guaranteed your mew (66:57 - 67:03)
the problem why will never got victini (67:00 - 67:05)
is because we'll never open the app (67:03 - 67:08)
on sunday as a ticket holder to accept (67:05 - 67:11)
the victini quest but if will was my bad (67:08 - 67:14)
son for that if will was to accept the (67:11 - 67:16)
victini quest even after the sunday is (67:14 - 67:17)
over he would (67:16 - 67:18)
he would have still been able to do the (67:17 - 67:20)
victini quest but he never accepted it (67:18 - 67:23)
so yes it is possible i suppose you (67:20 - 67:24)
could spend 12.99 (67:23 - 67:26)
and then never log in at all between (67:24 - 67:27)
saturday and then (67:26 - 67:30)
never get the quest but as long as you (67:27 - 67:32)
spell spend the 12.99 and accept (67:30 - 67:35)
the mew quest you will eventually be (67:32 - 67:36)
guaranteed a shiny mew (67:35 - 67:38)
even if you don't get it that saturday (67:36 - 67:40)
and based on what niantic has said (67:38 - 67:42)
the mew quest is extremely long and (67:40 - 67:44)
tedious i'm sure (67:42 - 67:47)
of hardcore players will finish it the (67:44 - 67:47)
day of (67:47 - 67:49)
i mean there are already people at level (67:47 - 67:51)
50 in pokemon go (67:49 - 67:53)
uh but just so you know if you spend the (67:51 - 67:55)
11.99 (67:53 - 67:58)
and you cannot play all day on saturday (67:55 - 68:01)
it's okay you'll still be able to get (67:58 - 68:03)
your mew (68:01 - 68:05)
you just have to log in but that being (68:03 - 68:07)
said i'm sure niantic will (68:05 - 68:09)
clear that up as we get closer to that (68:07 - 68:12)
event of exactly what is needed (68:09 - 68:15)
to accomplish that but i just wanted to (68:12 - 68:17)
clear that up for people who were on the (68:15 - 68:18)
fence about (68:17 - 68:21)
spending 12 okay (68:18 - 68:23)
with that being said if you want to (68:21 - 68:24)
follow us on twitter (68:23 - 68:26)
