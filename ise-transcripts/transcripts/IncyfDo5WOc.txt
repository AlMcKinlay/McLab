[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 260 of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host SBJ and with me on this thursday night because it's not sunday because there's another convention in my life I have will so I've been curious lately do you know the song bangla by the band here we go magic is that by rara riot no I sides by here we go magic the No mmm interesting because I always suspect that you might be a vampire and that's definitely a song a vampire window so what I might be wrong can I don't want to thank Allah I'm gonna give a free promo right here I've been listening to nicks so Nick one of the moderators in slack one of the first patreon backers one of the first people to annoy me daily every single day but no great guy he is the one that does all like the intermission music and he also like did the theme song and the the credits for it's super effective and everything super great guy who would have guessed he's a musician who would have guessed the guy making our intermission intermission music and our theme songs are in musician but he has like two albums out maybe more but his last album which I think came out in 2013 super fantastic it's really really good and I've been listening to a lot recently I don't know I don't know how to describe it it kind of like reminds me of like a broken bells kind of tone to it is what broken bells a band or just you're describing these broken bells is amazed literally just him shaking a bell over and over for 34 minutes it's it's really good and if you just search Nicholas bird Jess on soundcloud or on itunes and i believe it's on spotify you can find it but that's yeah that's there's your free promo Nick you're on which kid which album are you listening to because I've listened to mostly wizard planet oh that I see that's the one I haven't listened to I listened to the one I listened to the red one which was his newest one now I feel like really bad that I don't know the name it is called king of another dimension yeah Nick also did the does all the music for dr check yeah and people are grooving on our season two new theme so that's legit Travis Travis also here oh I thought I thought you were gonna say oh and our second guest is Nick purchase I guess I guess I'm on this episode yeah this is like your last episode for a while you're gonna be gone my last episode ever no I'm traveling next weekend to visit my brother and then I'm also taking the next weekend off so so yeah I won't be on the show for a few weeks but is there some heavy metal music festival going on oh no not this time but my I ways my family always visits my brother over Easter aha it is Easter time the old bunny rabbit a bill lopunny three things for the show today we have some news and boy did I have to scrape the bottom of the barrel here for news we have some emails because you guys keep setting in emails and I I love it I want to like the highlights of my days is reading the emails you guys send them and then we have our poke amount of the week which i think is really an interesting choice so I'm excited to get to that too I don't know what we're gonna do with Travis gone and not having like somebody who's remotely like I don't know what we're gonna do with Pokemon of the week I'll figure it well if the whole thing just falls apart it all falls apart mythical newest season mythical has been out for the last week now about a full week well but time you hear this not but yeah well by the time you hear this it'll be it'll be a full week since it's been out so I just you know your standard promo mythical podcast com if you haven't checked it out this newest season I think we've said this million times in one episode but it's based on fiasco it is not based on DNT and it it is it is probably over produced I put a lot of time making sure everything was balanced there's a lot of music to it a lot of transitions and stuff so you do not need to listen to the other seasons to to listen to the season it's it's dubbed as season 2.5 and it's three episodes long it take you about hour and 50 minutes to get through all three episodes so if you are looking for something to listen to and you like the voices on it's super effective I would suggest checking it out like one of the voices on this episode of its liver effective I'm not there I'm there for at least 30 seconds in each other I think a big thing this past week is we did the three of us did a reddit AMA on our slat r / super effective our subreddit and I think about pretty pretty well pretty okay I went through the whole thing and had to correct every time you answered a question I had to be in the correction i answered one thing wrong but it was the it was the one you don't want to get wrong it's the one we completely forgot an entire weekend where all three of us spent time together actually heal you forgot two weekends where all three of us spend time together because you forgot that I was at VGC I forget oh we forgot because i was at 2011-2012 and i think even 2013 and then and then you also forgot that we were all there for was it 649 monsters or Battle City at you are at 16 14 46 49 pastures besides you know whatever you forget me I honestly don't remember that we can so for that was national as to where we all met for the first time right and yes I remember my very first I met you before that yeah yeah but the question was all three of us in the same room yeah because I got the very first time we met that was that mgc you came in you said hi and then I didn't see you for like a day and a half and then wedded him and very inaccurate statement of that question I came in you were like setting up and you were setting up early and I got there early and I asked if you wanted help with anything and you said no yep that's about me control frankly so I was like okay I guess I'll just do my own thing I'm not gonna stand here in a room and watch Steve put up lights that he bought a guitar center then I went and saw a movie because you said you didn't need my help so I love no not I'm the first day of MDC on Saturday you were you were not the most of the Le Sueur not in the room and I'm not like you were required to be I just remember I don't remember it like that because that was the day the tournament was and I was there for that and then I was there for the podcast recording after but you know hmm whatever details details but the story about nationals this is weird because we're talking about Pokemon before before we're allowed to I remember my very first Nationals because that was the Nationals where Maryland was the head judge and I was there with i was there playing the V believe it or not I was there playing the VG seas and I was with Aaron who is also playing in the deep lady GC in 2012 I thought you played VGC in twenty eleven twenty eleven i'm talking about this very saucy he's talking about his first Nationals yeah so I remember that and then I you weren't there and we'll was there and I think I can't really know I was there in twenty eleven were you oh yeah yeah yeah but you didn't say I don't you worry drew that I am just a blip in your life that you do I'm just digging myself into deeper hole that was way before though will was ever alive please grant be right right and then the next year I switched the card game right I didn't remember that you were there Travis until we'll set something on the reddit post but I remember pre like testing out my deck I was playing at that time v.v.v you were playing vvv vvv yep but I was I was doing something with I think I was play tete I think I was play testing against a hoe deck because i was playing against Chris Ilic one of the one of our fans down in Indiana he wrote an email like two weeks ago yeah and and I know Vinny was there and Dom was theirs from some friends that I think that he was not there Vinny was not there you're right that was that I was here with his girlfriend's episode is gonna be so long as we just hash out the details of something that what do listeners care about this yes what they asked it in the reddit a sniffing know that this so I remember I remember that deck so well and I remember I remember will being there because he had a shaved head at that time correct and then I remember participating in the tournament I pretty much got eliminated because I was playing against i was playing vvv vanilluxe Victini which is a very Ricky rolling dice kind of deck and I was playing a good night Lou know as playing against a valiant deck that kobata so vanilluxe in the in the TCG is weak against steel and there are no one plays steel decks in the TCG even to this day I was winning that match and we went into overtime and I was I was so far ahead winning we went into overtime so like I you get everyone gets you get three turns zero so everyone gets you get two turns really but they say three turns its 0 for you one for your opponent to for you three for your opponent game set and give ends so I was upper prize when we went into overtime the dude realized at the end of the game that he had the the that I was weak against steel so he called the judge over and the judge reversed it to the point where i was i was turned 0 for me and i was in a position where i couldn't win at all anymore even though i completely took my turn which put me like secured my win but the judge rolled back an entire move which is like unheard of to like you ok so usually in the TCG if you have completed your move and you have gone on and your opponent's there that move is set in stone everyone is satisfied and there are exceptions to that but like I don't know I was very upset and that's all I remember from that trip I was I remember vvv I remember meeting will with no hair I remember being extremely upset about that rule call and I remember nothing else I certainly remember you being extremely upset and one other thing I remember is that Irene was playing TCG at that time and her first match was at table 1 again yeah the guys from the what was that entire video top cut yep yes she won and she beat him and pretty much and he he he was so now he known as a better player yeah yeah totally but that that wasn't my first match though against the Cabal and I think that that might have been my third or fourth match of the day I remember you get in pretty sour that what that was I that was pretty much my match of the day like I knew at that point there was no point in continuing playing I was like of course you like quote unquote play for fun but now I like that deck alot though anyways how did you guys feel about the reddit overall the reddit the the reddit questions ed vana I wish there had been more questions and it was kind of at an odd time of day for me since it was in the middle of the workday and I was at work but I did my best to answer what I could but yeah I just wish there had been more people I'd ask more questions other words good mix I thought there was a better turnout to begin with especially since it was such a short notice and pet at the time of day right I don't know I'm on reddit 24-7 at work real well that's all I have to say about reddit 0 but it was fun if you missed that that obviously reddit hold on to everything so you can just go to our subreddit and it should be there on the front page somewhere so check that out reddit com / r / super effective no it's no it's yeah I like to I like to mix it up with with online names let's which is why this show has like six names yeah yeah totally yeah take all the names under under the your polenta hot cast you got your PK and then cast you got your it's super effective yet your Pokemon podcast it's super effective British we're just lousy with monikers well Pokemon podcast holds Pokemon podcast is just the long term for P came and cast right because when you see pkmn you that's just Pokemon and cast is usually just short for podcasts so it makes sense but pkmn cast / poke my podcast whatever you want it's easier to say like poke my podcast calm right that holds the multiple shows that that there are so in this case it's just it's super fective and mythical and then it's super effective is your flagship show and then the gravestone of critical hit yeah yeah and leftovers there was to their zuzia failed podcast so yeah let you know which are referenced on the bulbapedia page for it's super effective and i really really wish somebody would go in and update that page cuz boy is it out of date yeah yeah the bulbapedia page is super out today out of date but it exists let's get speaking of existing let's get into some news first bit of news here is like I said I had to dig deep for some articles and I was told people want a little bit more TCG so I pulled this TCG article here there is a type of cocoa pin collection box being released on jun 2nd in America and Europe it will come with a foil promo of top of cocoa a collector's pin 3 booster packs and a ptc geocode card this type of cocoa will be a hundred and ten HP lightning type it is a basic pokemon for a double colorless it will have flying flip this attack those 20 damage to each of your opponent's pokemon don't apply weakness or resistance to bench and 42 lightning and one colorless electric ball for a hundred damage week against fighting resist against metal no retreat cost which is a huge deal they're people like taboo cocoa type of cocos like the lucario of this generation i feel that is a terrible comparison yeah but Lucario's like bad and top of cocos cool tocayo goes real chill tópico goes like the Victini i think we needed pretty ok as like no like aaron existed objectively it's like the zapdos of this generation magan's aptos didn't get like that much lime light compared to like Mewtwo in Mew oh I mean I mean I get sometimes just a girl where your metric is like that dose got like in the second movie you get Zapdos right but you also get Articuno and you also get Moltres here I feel like we're just getting top of cocoa and the only reason tabu ley ley is in the conversation is because of EG seas but we're still not like you don't still see that and then you know what here's the correct comparison top of cocoa is the suicune of this generation that's another member of a trilogy that gets in the games and the anime i feel your longer emphasis then its other two trio partners yeah but isn't taboo coo coo 104 yet it's one of us you know November's the quadrilogy yeah the purple one it yet i'm finna yeah top abbulu you got top of lately yeah top of cocoa yeah and Finny see no one remembers fini at least I the way like Jessica dolphin it's the fairy one right there all fairies all right good all right conversation but top of Phineas water fairy got it and then top of Leila is psychic fairy tabu Coco is electric fairy tabu boo Luis grass grass yeah believe it or not Pokemon go has 65 million active player monthly active players still this is from Forbes there a reputable reputable site that's true ah let me read some of this article I won't read it all but ooh this article references references destiny I forgot about that putting that 65 million number in context is a little tough given the very nature of the video game industry last year mobile giant supercell reported that it had 450 million monthly users between clash of clans boom beach clash royale and its other games though the company has almost unparalleled success in the industry so it's definitely an outlier elsewhere destiny had about 30 million monthly players at its peak call a duty had 40 million all Blizzard games had about 42 million combined of last year though almost all those titles have upfront costs league legends the free-to-play MOBA boasted a few months ago that its popularity has only increased in time and now it's up to a hundred million monthly players so even with its diverse range in titles 65 million players is this far after a lot the launch for Pokemon go is certainly still impressive it's absolutely more than I would have imagined I being the author but monthly players are not daily players but people log in twice a month to see if anything's different aren't exactly going to be big cash cows go may not be able to monetize monthly players quite as well as other games with much more aggression aggression transaction mechanics and yet it is still one of the highest grossing games according to most estimates as of this article i'm pretty sure pokemon go is still hovering around the top 10 in the apple itunes app store under downloads or highest grossing or under under grossing i could probably check i'll do my pokemon go update here have you guys been playing or no no I have not no I just I don't know it's still too cold and I still don't really think to play it when I'm indoors and just sitting there and spinning the same pokey stop every 10 minutes is not at all entertaining to me so I don't do that and it's you know it's supposed to snow tonight hi April in Michigan great fun cool love it snow cool oh yeah it's still too cold so still not playing it pokeman go right now is number 14 of the top-grossing in itunes so it's pretty good candy crush is right above it yeah i'm kind of disturbed that tinder is number 10 i was like what are you paying for in there now don't you pay for I've never used tinder but don't you pay for like more swipes don't you run out of swipes at a certain point I don't think so pretty wild if that's true the only thing I remember that you know this is going to be a prob with right the only thing I remember that you would have to pay for in tinder is if you wanted to be able to hide yourself from your family and friends oh I think maybe you can pay maybe this was an okcupid thing where when you look at somebody's profile they know you looked at it so they can look at you but I think if you pay you can look at people without them knowing you looked at them I think that specifically on tinder because you have to sign up for tinder with facebook yes if you pay it goes through your facebook family and friends and they have tinder account so they don't ever see you I see you na you have to pay for that feature is that disturbing as a little weird is there any tinder podcast can we monopolize here I would not down to do at ICAST no I would not we can merge it with like a snapchat podcast we can get both markets in one I feel like if you're a tinder user you're also a snapchat user well I'm definitely either so I'm your theory is definitely what I voted by your theory because I've never had either all right got another news article from BBC News here might be a touchy topic so I'll turn off my joking voice here his Pokemon go helping stop suicide at hotspots in Japan Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world but one notorious beaut beautiful spot has noted a welcome and unexpected lack of deaths this year a fact attributed to an unseen factor Pokemon go there was an interview at BBC I don't want to go into the details of of death rates here but he suspects Pokemon go the wildly popular mobile game in which people catch virtual characters in physical locations could be behind it drawing crowds in pursuit of rare creatures to breathe air the Pokemon go effect is huge he is the author or the person being interviewed told the Japanese the Japanese news website dot in Japanese we hope I hope we can continue at this pace with zero suicides Vicky sorry G director of tell life live a counseling and mental health service for Japan's international community told the BBC the decline was a positive development she said there was probably a number of factors to play including a chance in the decline but that it may be that the game has had an impact most people who choose to take their own lives so do it so in a private place often they're home she says since the game has come out there's been many media reports of crowds of gamers at the toes Jimbo suggesting that it is no longer the same appeal for those seeking isolation with media attention and a major factor in drawing people to suicide hot spots it's not impossible that different coverage of this area's help changing its reputation time of this year can be especially tough spring often seasonal sees a rise in suicides around the world but it is particularly pronounced in Japan miss surge oki says where April is the start of the school year financial year and where many local companies take on new staff and move existing staff around there's a lot of stress around this time but with a greater willingness to talk about mental health and an increase in services offering to listen Japan may be slowly getting a grip on a suicide problem so I don't know if I said this I apologize beginning the article the the spot we're talking about is is like this cliff area that's touching the ocean it's it's actually really quite beautiful but that place in particular was known for suicides so what do you guys think about this obviously not a joking matter but I think it's important and I think that overall it's it's good news right like mental health is something that's more openly talked about and I think that's a good thing so I would say two things to just to keep in mind when thinking about the article one is if there are more people going to toe Jimbo because there's polka stops and Pokemon there it may just mean that people are looking to other locations yeah yeah so it may just have shifted the statistic to a different place so that the right they weren't staying an overall reduction didn't say they just say in the article that it's been less less what at that location or was it just less overall I believe less overall but so technically that location I did I sorry I skimmed the article there was I didn't want to report the actual numbers mm-hmm well those are their big numbers but the other thing I would say also is one thing I remember I was watching a documentary once about the Golden Gate Bridge and you know that's also a popular place for suicides and one thing that one of the people who had basically been stopped from committing suicide there said was you know as I was walking along the bridge if one person had smiled at me and like said good morning I completely would have changed my mind but it's like nobody looked at me and that just you know maybe more committed and it's like if people are out playing pokemon go they're generally in a happier friendlier mood right because they're out a grating yeah playing they might be more willing to like if they see somebody else like extend it like with me I'm adamant like when I'm walking my dog I'm like the most aggressive good morning person you'll ever meet like I always smile and say good morning to every single person I pass just because I mean that's that's just me I a I mean even in Milwaukee when you when you stayed with me and you went for a run you would you you you came back kind of joking kind of serious but when you would say good morning to people Milwaukee and they didn't really they were like I did it would give me a look like why is this person talking to ya no but I can believe it I agree with you on the aspect of Pokemon go players at least I I will never forget the summer and I will never ever forget the summer Pokemon go came out and just the amount of people playing and the chest how friendly everyone was to each other I've lived in milwaukee for 28 years and like I I know I know what the people are alike and I know when I traveled to Chicago or Minnesota or New York or Boston those people are dramatically different than the people in the walking well not dramatically but in some aspects yes seeing the Pokemon go phase hit like there was absolutely without a doubt in my mind just more positivity in those parks in those neighborhoods between people and I it has made me more confident in a person to like just walk down the street and just say hi to somebody just to say hi to somebody and like it feels good when they say hi back I mean love you don't have having a conversation but it's still like I think that's important yeah and no it's not else's existence yes yeah and regardless of whether or not the this article whether or not the location described in this article is representative of overall statistics generally you know at least the anecdotal evidence from the documentary that that will watch indicates that saying hi in interacting with people has a can have a more profound positive effect than you would anticipate so yeah as long as you're respecting people's boundaries I I love when people interact with me and and and i think that most people are that way and and i think that most people also think i know i shouldn't say anything because i don't want to bother this person but thinking of myself ninety-nine percent of the time if someone says hello to when walking down the street I'm not like oh oh how dare you although apparently the people in Milwaukee are like that but I don't know they're just that they're not excited they're just like confused yeah but yeah I I think I think I speak for the majority of people when I say that it's a very nice feeling to be recognized um yeah so Pokemon podcast fans let's let's say hello to people when we across them on the street yeah yeah I will say that there has been zero reports this year and as opposed to X number last year and X the year before but if this was if you wanted to check out this article it is on the BBC it was april six so very very recent actually today it was reported so it's a BBC / news / world asia should be on the front page even if you're listening to this a couple days later or just use the search feature just thought that would be worth bringing up final better news here is Nintendo might have accidentally revealed that the that Pokemon is coming to the switch this is from the Sun the the celestial body or is this some sort of publication about citepublication poke my own creators believe is something son right it's like the it's the subtle you can Sun the Sun a news UK company is the is the headline yeah I think in the UK there is it's literally just called the Sun kind of like the mirror got it Pokmon creators gamefreak are hiring and eagle-eyed Pikachu fans are insisting that the job adverts to suggest a new pokemon game will be available on intent to switch by the summer of 2018 it is searching for several recruits for a game console in its tokyo studio according to silicon era and several other gaming sites they would be working on a globally popular title which isn't for smartphones they need a cartoon modeler to create exaggerated cartoon style people and monsters they are also in the market for 3d graphic designer to work out monsters Nintendo has not hasn't confirmed any extra games for its brand new switch console but Pokemon is one of the most successful games following Mario and Zelda actually pretty confident that it does way better than zelda does it it's not the first time rumors of a new console game have gotten fans pumped a director a director's cut of Pokemon Sun and Moon titled Pokemon stars is said to be in the works but not confirmed so there you go Game Freak is hiring thing about this that is strange to me is that it's it was it's but it sounded like the article said Nintendo was hiring but if it were Pokemon it would presumably be Game Freak right I don't know the article say Game Freak game free oh why the Nintendo switch go that's musta been where I was confused yeah this is just a port of the what does that thing elephant game o.o tambo that game was so bad it is a port of the tempo game to the switch that's all it is I mean that game is monstrous it is cycling light it I don't know why I'm so hard on it maybe just cuz the only opinion I've heard of it is Steve's and I just trust him no no it tempo I would say is closer to like a donkey kong country and in play style but I don't feel like it plays well now to flip that coin another game freak game pocket car jockey which is on the 3ds extremely amazing it is a really really fun game that plays really well it's like solitaire / horse racing and that sounds that sounds really silly but it works really well together and it's it's a really great game I think it's like 799 it's dirt cheap so you're looking for some more horses you can you name the horses you can breed the horses your horses can have rolling baby horses ah think there's oh yeah there's a little like what do you call those like little balls that like roll out of a machine and then you break them open like a gotcha pond yeah there's gotcha ponds that's rollin no hay the role they gotta roll out of the machine do they not know yes my answer is no this is not going to happen the horses are really cute too I've seen the horses I have no interest in regards to this article Ida it's hard to react to because we kind of already have reacted to the previous Pokemon stars rumor and it would just be us saying the same things like yeah oh that would be cool hmm I got it it's it's it's difficult to think of anything substantial to say when we've had this rumor fairly recently a very similar rumor very recently and not a lot of the details of change other than Moore's more evidence for its existence like it's difficult to know how to and intelligibly whoo I can't even speak so I'm not gonna end the sun's but you know what I mean yes yes I do yeah we don't have any new info obviously we we do know that Game Freak is working on something it was told that all Nintendo studios are making something for switch assumption was this was going to be something Pokemon related but we don't know that's what everyone wants I suppose but I think everyone also wants a quick break so we will take one and when we come back we're going to do just a couple emails and your pokémon of the week so we will be right back I don't hate how the fellas good areas like boring and bad cell is good I'm interesting Zelda's good there's probably a horse at some point and we are back from our break let's do some emails here so if you have any emails questions comments concerns life facts about hot dogs you can send us emails over at SB j @ p km n CA esti com or you can go over to Pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button but both both are acceptable for emails let's do this email from Sam Sam rights India's he has a couple of questions let's uh let's do two of them here first one is do you think that there will be a Pokemon stars or a sin o remake for the 3ds switch or boa second question is a bird is a burrito a sandwich thanks for the that no thank you for reading I listen to your show every week please continue making awesome content and says their favorite is Travis ya gotta gotta include your favorite there so you have two questions let's start with the the hard one here is a burrito a sandwich no yes of course I would it be 10 cuz it's a sandwich just trying to make sandwiches surrounded by bread isn't right I wouldn't I wouldn't call it I wouldn't call a wrap a sandwich I would agree isn't a tortilla just Mexican bread no isn't it you know like mostly flour tortilla what did what is bread right is mostly flour no bread is mostly wheat wheat flour flour and wheat or not the same thing that's rather say making it hard you're making it harder and harder to be on this side of the argument timer is made from wheat wheat was its late on wheat flour wheat is like plants flower is like sugar that doesn't taste good no no flour is a product that's made from wheat but I would still say that Turk that I wouldn't call yeah I wouldn't call a wrap let's say which and so therefore burrito is a similar food item so similarly I wouldn't call it a sandwich my grief well you're both wrong so whereas a hot dog is surrounded by bread yeah which is a very sandwich yeah very very important now the second question was a sin o remix stars 3d s which both I feel like we're I'll do the easy part I feel like we're at the point where we're not giving anything on both it's gonna be one to the other I know you mean you mean both consoles or both platforms yeah they did they did do Pokemon uh to the whole goodness what is that worst series of Pokemon games Oh mystery dungeon yes angie was a little across consoles did slit it if had some rough titles recently mr. Desmond would never had a rough title pokemon ranger I've employed it so I I agree there you go you heard it here first there is precedent for releasing the same game on to nintendo nintendo nintendo consoles namely the last Super Smash Brothers was released on both the 3ds and the wii u well Zelda was on switch and wii u yeah but that was that was a promise situation so Smash Brothers was where both were in the in their prime well mm-hmm the prime for we took last two haha but smell like I way i would consider smash brothers a console seller and there was just so many 3d asses out there that that made sense to zelda on the other hand was Zelda is a console seller as we've seen the Nintendo switches me is is selling very well that's because of shovel Knight dude but yeah right that's true shovel Knight is good but it you you started that game on wii u so you would you would be breaking you would probably have way more upset fans to then say like okay this game was planned for Wii U you guys all bodily you for this game but now we're not gonna give it to you especially because like the Wii U and the switch aren't that drastically different in hardware so that that made sense we're now we're at a point where the switch is brand new and the 3ds is what almost seven years old that's weird to think about and there are still reports that 3d Isis are hard to find I feel like you look at the you look at the sales of of the last three pokemon game so you look at x and y you look at Omega Ruby alpha sapphire and then you look at you look at Sun and Moon and you go okay if we release stars a version that we know won't sell as well as x and y or sun and moon it will probably sell as well as something like I don't even think it would sell as well as Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire because the advantage that that game had is we haven't played it in like ten years whereas we just played Sun and Moon so you look at those sales numbers and you go Omega Ruby alpha sapphire is the least selling game out of the three we really stars we know we're not going to pass those sales so when when you do that investor call you go well we'd only sell this amount whereas you take that to a new console like the switch and you go not only would we probably sell that same amount on a new console we will help push that console we will help push more sales to that console and still solve the same amount and be able to do way more with the game because sun and moon was already like so sluggish and so crippled by the performance of the 3ds i mean i'm not going to disagree i think you're pretty accurate in all those statements wait we didn't we didn't answer the other question we didn't answer the sinnoh remake question which is the goal I'm more interested in oh you would assume there would do and right it seemed like they were pretty hesitant to do the gem 3 remakes I remember both were well in retrospect now I think we know it was before those games were being developed I forgot it was if it was junichi Masuda or someone else tweeted something like or maybe an interview or some higher up at game freak's at something along the lines of we get a lot of requests from our fans for a remake of generation 3 those are very important to me so like will consider this consider it or something and it sounded like the way it was articulated made it sound like I wish I could just link Michael but it's a vague memory from like 10 years ago not that long ago but the vague memory from a long time ago so I can't give it to you but I remember some sort of interview like that happening that made it sound like it was partially a toss-up whether or not Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire we're gonna happen and I don't think there's as rabid demand for a diamond and pearl remake as there was for a gen 3 remake but I agree with you there I I think gen 3 fans are some of the most vocal fans in the world but you know we've been doing this podcast for almost seven years now and we've had Pokemon droughts before we've had times where it was like okay not a lot of video game news and that's probably what helps with our episodes that were so TCG focused at the time because you're always getting TCG stuff and for sun and moon just coming out you know not even not even six months ago has it been six months five months ah we're yeah we're at five months cuz it was and over November min gambar end of november so with Sun and Moon one of the the faster selling Pokemon games will probably surpass x and y and sales pretty easily pretty universally loved right people were so happy hm's were gone people loved the the new pokemon people like the new regions people really liked the story like there there's so many things that game has done right everything leading up to sun and moon was done so well in the marketing aspect of i felt like we were getting something pokemon every single week before that game came out but then even when that game came out i felt like we were still getting stuff so having all that lead up to Pokemon Sun and Moon we are now five months disconnected from that game and I feel like we are in one of the biggest Pokemon slumps right now then then we've had in such a long time in years and and i can i can say that by looking at our listener numbers i can say that by trying to scrounge news to report on i could say that just by their account tweeting and just being active it's just we're in a point now where I cannot I just can't believe that it's only been five months and people are pretty done having a conversation about sun and moon like i can believe it because it's happening and what does that say and i'm curious what that what this has to do with the prospect of a diamond and pearl remake in your perspective I think that's needed I mean I oh yeah i mean i don't disagree that there needs to be some sort of pokemon thing to revitalize interest in the franchise but we've had a strange series of having our expectations being broken lately with well if you go back to Gen 5 doing something different for the third version instead doing a black 2 and white 2 which was very different from the tradition of just releasing a third version and then acts and why after that not having any third version out just doing a remake so they've I mean sure the sort of change ups have been centered around the existence or nonexistence of a third version but the fact that there have been switcheroos in the release schedule sort of the release routine that we had gotten used to prior to that to me makes nothing a sure bat like it used to be also am I the only one who feels like diamond and pearl came out like two weeks ago and yet somehow their 10 year old games like dynamo does not feel as old I feel like they're old I do they're they're real old to me diamond and pearl does not feel as old now as Ruby and Sapphire felt a bit before the race release of those those remakes but there but like diamond and pearl I like 10 or 11 years old and ruby and sapphire were like 10 or 11 years old when when omega ruby and alpha sapphire came out it just doesn't feel like that same time difference maybe it's just because I'm getting older and so all the time is racing past me and I'm careening towards my certain death faster and faster but who knows you look at main series games and why i say i feel like we're getting we have to get a diamond and pearl remake eventually as you look at the main series games and besides gen 1 and jen to there they're all you know three to four years apart only being five months away from sun and moon dao it's like okay well we got two years and six months to go before we get generation eight so really we have two years before they even start considering talking about that what do we get in between we r get a remake which would be diamond and pearl one would assume or we get a third version of sun and moon which wouldn't do as well because the third version ever does but that's fine but they know that i think the audience knows that but looking at the success that they had from x and y into Omega Ruby alpha sapphire into sun and moon I felt like that was a non-stop roller coaster of just pokemon pokemon pokemon pokemon and now what are they going to do until generation eight like the in in this two and a half years that we have until generation eight they just can't do pokemon stars I feel like that's not enough they've all have so much momentum going or had going even with with something even with stuff like go that worked that got people back in the Pokemon so to to take all that momentum you had going into Sun and Moon and now just only have 11 game planned and that game is just a remake of the game that you you you bet all your horses on that just doesn't seem right like they have to have something besides a third version what would what adjectives would you put before diamond and pearl to make it remake a fight like Omega Alpha heart soul what adjectives are you gonna put before diamond and pearl propagating diamond lustrous pearl probably something with space-going galactic pearl and timeless diamond that actually sounds already yeah I kind of like that a spatial dymond planar pearl galactic pearl and De Beers diamond oh don't don't know uh yeah I i I've it were told don't that was I mean diamond and pearl selling point was the whole space / time continuum who knows great question though thank you Sam fretting him oh man so many questions here Connor from ontario toronto ontario that that i believe that is in your future home Travis of Kenda it is in Canada it's actually I am closer to ontario now then i would be in when i moved to winnipeg but that's another story for another day I guess hi SBJ and crew this is my first time riding into the podcast I've been listening to the show since fall and it is by far the best Pokemon podcasts have listened to have a few questions to ask the crew what new type of Pokemon would you like to see what is each of your dream teams non-competitive just Pokemon you love and or represent fuel u- skarmory Lucario Glade sceptile melodic and size or sounds like a pretty good team already what mega evolutions would you like to see for certain pokemon i am waiting for megam melodic and finally did you clean your dog today love the show keep up the amazing work Connor man I could probably run through they're gonna have to tell me each question one at a time yeah I've already forgotten that whatever the first one was let's go backwards mega evolution you'd like to see oh I think I've already said I think at one point I said mega Victini let's take a step away from mega Victini and say mega Dunsparce this is gonna be a foreshadowing to Pokemon that I would include in my little favorite personal team but mega gourgeist i would go with a new one i usually say mega farfetch but I'm gonna go with mega hoo Oh interesting hmm dream team non-competitive just Pokemon you love and or feel represent you man mine would probably be like lotad farfetch gold duck chandelure chocolate right don't yell and Alma night there you go oh don't throw my night there you fibber oh well that's great that is not it's so cute you just living the lie living the lie it's so do down all right here we go we got a talonflame we got a wow wow my brain is just not working what's the ferry with the by T's rabanne be no Harry with the Whitey's the Whitey's on the head they're like extra mouths wide while making the tub wow I my brain is just not working right now we gotta Zoroark we got bukhari ie I'm not putting aloe kario on my team I don't like fighting types uh probably reuniclus voluto for a bomb be again I do like wabam be and probably uh what's the dupe eter love dupa turn ever evolve that guy turns into yuck to put her what a silly name it's a silly name but he's a really cute pokemon yeah yeah yeah requin it might be a strange-looking pokemon but it does occupy a very interesting niche competitively because it because of its ability water bubble which does a lot of weird stuff it makes it a very interesting one trick pony because it makes its water-type move so strong that you basically don't want to use anything other than liquidation so you just slap a choice band on there and it's very good at hitting things very hard with liquidation and not very good at anything else well paid resist fire which is good for oh bugger no correct mine is hard to do because there's I'd like a lot of Pokemon uh but i'll just list the ones that want to include and then i'll cut some that aren't gonna make the cut but piloswine vanilluxe slurpuff rabanne be me out on CH crow gourgeist would probably be the seven my top 7 and I gotta cut one it's tough I guess I cut I guess I cut the hunch from that rolling with that like I'm you know more I'm I'm gonna cut gourgeist from that list I like gourgeist a lot but it's it's in my top 10 but probably not gonna make it in my top 60 it's gonna be piloswine vanilluxe row bomb be slurpuff meowth and the hunch hunch last last question that there was was what new type would you want to see everyone knows my answer I mean everyone also knows my answer I've been resolute about this all the times this question has been asked which is no new types I can't contain them all I I contain multitudes but I cannot contain multitudes of type information within my but to be fair Sun and Moon has made it really easy with showing you the moves and not needing to memorize all the time true i guess in that case will say i feel like that was a problem that no one thought could be fixed and they fixed it like instantly yeah for me I would say void type so something it embodies emptiness hmm well as Travis is thinking I will say sound type and let me tell you why there are a lot of sound type moves that exist that will play a part in why they could retro actively fits down type into pokemon that already exists I mean your give your Givens or like something like a Loudred or annoy Vern but sound based moves like i said already exists there there's abilities for them too but you have moves like boom burst bug buzz chatter clanging set clanging and banging scales confide disarming voice echoed voice grass whistled growl he'll bail hyper voice metal sound Noble roar parting shot harrisch song relic song roar round screech shadow panic sing snarl snore sparkling araya supersonic and uproar all these moves exist sound type could be possible folks and that would be sparkling aria oh sure sure sure imma said sparkling water I was really into it haha I can't I still can't think of one I don't know I just did my taxes so bureaucrat type I don't know the thing that makes the thing they would have to change a few things for sound type to be possible they would have to pretty wildly change the ability soundproof because soundproof is an ability that prevents damage from well maybe not I guess cuz like levitate museum you in the ground yeah so I guess soundproof just makes me immune to sound sound and ground the the only weird thing with sound type that I would think of is like it's kind of easy like Loudred right now is just normal so you just stick sound type on Loudred and you solve that problem but something like no verne is already dragon flying yeah just take the flying away so it's dragging round then there are weird ones like Magnum like the Magnemite line would arguably need sound type too because they're all about like they're always depicted as like emitting sonic waves and that sort of thing and pretty much all the media with that line so but you can't really take away electric or steel and do it justice so who knows you could add it to like Voltorb an electrode I feel like they somehow put out sound and some well they know sonic boom and stuff think they can learn screech and I feel like electrode can learn at rightlook everything a lot of electric types can learn screech like electabuzz and electivire yeah learn screech maybe they hear the itm some other generation ago and maybe they can't now great question that will do one more email here and then we'll do our pokemon of the week the cody rights in from Pittsburgh hey it's super effective crew firstly I love the show and I can't say any one is my favorite because I love you all anyways ah you recently and frequently hate on pokemon black 2 except for will Will's the man and take back my earlier statement he's my favorite black and white 2 came out when I was in college and my best friend and I made a deal to switch our starter pokemon as soon as we could to our favorite pokemon i swapped mine out for swinub swinub i can't say i said i could never say it swinub swinub oh yes like I love swine yeah so i end up with icicle crash and she swapped hers out force and I'll we also came up with a silly store a silly little story about how we got our pokemon and how we met each other to become rivals we named our rival characters after each other could you do that black way too I feel like this is fake haha why can I don't I saw yeah I thought you stop naming rivals in in like diamond and pearl I can't remember anyways no you could definitely name your diamond and pearl rival cuz you could name Barry whatever you want oh yeah yeah Perry Perry rocks it was the best time I ever had in Pokemon because of the way we played it soul Silver's probably stole my favorite all-time favorite pokemon game but black and white 2 has such a special place in my heart have you guys ever swapped out your starter Pokemon early on to switch up gameplay how about do a Nuzlocke adventure where were your were what were your experiences like it either love the show keep up the good work love and peace etc etc Cody so through my playthrough of Omega Ruby I yeah I brought a team in x and y and transferred the eggs over to Omega Ruby and hatch the eggs there and played it with that team and ditched oh oh who did I start with Swampert that middle Mudkip ditch that guy as quickly as possible pulled this story I pulled this email for the story as for the question I don't think I've ever swap stuff but when diamond and pearl came out and I picked it up with my friend uh we would stop at every city like every major city we would battle each other which was pretty cool until they they got angry and quit the game but that was like sick those five cities of like okay we're we're both level 15 let's battle okay we're both level 22 now let's battle it was just like a cool way to have it like an additional rival in the game well that that'll do it for emails if like I said it prior to emails if you have any emails you can send those to SBJ at pkmn casscom or just go to Pokemon podcast.com and hit that email button at the top of the page and that'll go to my inbox oh sorry I fertile II forgot the what I was going to say about that last email i was going to say that they said that black and white 2 was one of their favorites and then they explained the story to follow black and white 2 and I think that's I think that's important and I think that's why a lot of people like gem 3 because that was probably some of their very first games and I think and at least in my in my shoes I I missed out on jun 3 that was when I fell out of Pokemon so when I when I went back to it after playing diamond pearl I was like yeah this is fine but there was no there's no story there for me whereas I just told the story that i had with with diamond and pearl and black and white 2 I felt like was the same thing where there was no story there like I got it I played a little bit of it I was unhappy with how it looked on the 3ds and I didn't have a d/s anymore because i sold it for some reason the the very first 3d esas emulated DS games very poorly and it looked really bad that that's really all I wanted to say I think you have people that you have people that they're one of the some of their favorite games or because there's there's a story tied to it almost every time which is cool let's shift gears here to Pokemon of the week kind of a funny one that's where I come in it's all you now you miss you in a streaming service I think there's a streaming service called you now oh you want me to set this up a why we picked this pokemon i guess you can sao joao from Sarah be usually tweets the pokemon that are most used in the the current meta of the video game he recently tweeted that slowbro with EVO light was being used and he couldn't believe it and so I didn't really look into that nor thought like I didn't think about it either but I told Travis I was like hey I heard that the Travis the dirt on the street slowbro with EVO lights getting a lotta you know what and it's like no I don't know where no no wonder I'm the one that does the bow come out of the week segment cuz whoever your informant is is missing something here because slowbro can evolve and so would therefore get no usage out of EV light so I so after Travis told me that I went back and I was like where where did I get this sweet dirt from and I dug up the dirt and track down Joe from Serbia and then I thought Joe and give bad information but what Joe is saying was he couldn't believe that people were using evo light with slowbro because it doesn't actually work but celebra made it as high as the 80th most used pokemon in video King meta so I felt like well I guess slow burrows doing pretty well on its own with technically no held item at this point well it's not like evo light was the most used held item in those statistics or anything it was one of the lower use one of the least used held items in the statistics it's just surprising that people use it at all because it does literally nothing yes cuz slowbro doesn't evolve into slowking slow barreto does that's the confusion and it can also learn the move confusion our it looks like we've got just the one move set for this week I think we're confusing folks by doing it on to Thursday's in a row so we've only got the one this is coming from Kevin Soria that's 252 evs and HP 252 in defense and foreign special defense with a bold nature the ability regenerator one of my favorite abilities it will heal the Pokemon that has regenerator when it switches out it's not quite as good and doubles as it is in singles but as you can imagine singles it makes for great Pokemon to pivot with you can switch to a Pokemon it takes a hit and then when you need to switch that Pokemon out to get a better matchup the Pokemon the you switch out with regenerator gains health and it's very good still fairly useful in doubles because there is still switching in doubles but just not quite as much but it's still really strong ability with leftovers as the held item as you can expect from the EV spread that has no attack or a special attack investment this is a mostly support set or defensive set rather with scald slack off trick room and then either psyshock or Calm Mind scald is even though it was nerfed this generation still a very strong move it's been a strong move since its introduction the ability to slap a burn on something is very strong and it's just ate good water type same type attack bonus move slack off is an incredible move to recover some HP get fifty percent of it back trick room is always going to be an important force in the doubles metagame to do some speed control and then sighs shock would be in there for same type attack bonus with psychic if you need you know something to deal super effective damage to like a fighting type or a poison-type I suppose although I'm struggling to think of a poison-type that psychic would hit super effective that's getting a lot of usage like muck you have a MUX also dark type so that's not going to do anything so yeah I'm not sure psychic nail Lego or nail ago however you supposed to say that ultra beasts name gets a fair amount of making it there yeah I guess it's like nihilism isn't it yeah but anyway then the other move choice for that fourth slot Kevin recommends call mind which allows you to be able to do a little more if the game starts to go long you know having a Pokemon with multiple stat bonuses can be very good late-game missing and kind of once you've knocked out a few Pokemon that might threaten slowbro can make it very difficult to deal with yet slowbro it's a cool pokemon its a good bro the breast of bros a shiny slowbro will be purple instead of pink and have more of a brownish shells of a grey show I much-improved shiny looks a little like Barney some trivia here despite it being commonly known and accept accepted fact that shelter triggers its evolution mention in most of its pokedex entries slow burrows evolution from slowpoke has nothing to do with shelter in the core series unlike how the evolution of man tyke requires remoraid mega slow bro is tied with a cloister for the highest defense base stat of all water-type pokemon mega slow bro has the highest defense set of all psychic type pokemon slow bros pokedex entries states that if the shelter is removed it reverts to its slow pokes form this is only a mentioning by Pokemon possibly devolving any Pokemon in the game aside from the card game and game versions of the TCG many pokémon are noted to evolve by two or more Pokemon combinations such as matang being formed by two Bell domes however the animate does not show this and simply spawns the second Pokemon out of nowhere an example is Morrison's beldam which simply evolved into a matang without needing to join another beldam the evolution of slow poke into slowbro or slow King is the only time that evolution by two Pokemon physically merging is shown mega slow bro also really cool I like Myra Slowbro a lot is it I'll accept it punches the eyes out of the Porsche elder thing is it good competitively or was it never mega slow bro oh never yeah maybe never I don't know enough I think it was mmm I'm gonna try and guess I think it was in like underused or maybe even rarely used in smog on steering to give you an idea let me look what you continue on is mega slow bro did appear in the anime Slowbro obviously in the anime quite a bit and then you have slowking which was was famous for their movie in the second pokemon the movie 2000 do a little bit of housecleaning here I'm recording this before the Midwest game in classic this will come out the night that the Midwest human classic ends so shout out to everyone that came out to that and said hello if not sorry you missed it I will be selling shirts and stickers and some posters at mgc so if there's any left over i will i'll see if anyone else

should say um since i won't be on the show for a few weeks we are nearing we're kind of nearing the end of season one of very random encounters and i mentioned that because the show is designed much like mythical to be lip you can listen from the start of any season and in fact each season we're playing a different role playing game I don't know what it's going to be because we haven't rolled to determine who the DM is yet but the randomly generated role-playing game podcast that I'm on where all of the characters all the situations are determined randomly is nearing the end of its first season so you can catch up on that or just check to see when season 2 comes out and hop on there it's been a lot of fun Travis is at the travis w on twitter will is at wash in the sink i am at
