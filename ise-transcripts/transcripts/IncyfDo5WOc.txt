Pokemon of the week I'll figure it well (3:50 - 3:55)
if the whole thing just falls apart it (3:52 - 3:58)
all falls apart mythical newest season (3:55 - 4:01)
mythical has been out for the last week (3:58 - 4:03)

know your standard promo mythical (4:09 - 4:12)
podcast com if you haven't checked it (4:10 - 4:14)
out this newest season I think we've (4:12 - 4:16)
said this million times in one episode (4:14 - 4:18)
but it's based on fiasco it is not based (4:16 - 4:23)
on DNT and it it is it is probably over (4:18 - 4:25)
produced I put a lot of time making sure (4:23 - 4:27)
everything was balanced there's a lot of (4:25 - 4:29)
music to it a lot of transitions and (4:27 - 4:32)
stuff so you do not need to listen to (4:29 - 4:34)
the other seasons to to listen to the (4:32 - 4:37)
season it's it's dubbed as season 2.5 (4:34 - 4:40)
and it's three episodes long it take you (4:37 - 4:42)
about hour and 50 minutes to get through (4:40 - 4:44)
all three episodes so if you are looking (4:42 - 4:46)
for something to listen to (4:44 - 4:48)
and you like the voices on it's super (4:46 - 4:51)
effective I would suggest checking it (4:48 - 4:53)
out like one of the voices on this (4:51 - 4:56)
episode of its liver effective I'm not (4:53 - 4:58)
there I'm there for at least 30 seconds (4:56 - 5:02)
in each other I think a big thing this (4:58 - 5:05)
past week is we did the three of us did (5:02 - 5:08)
a reddit AMA on our slat r / super (5:05 - 5:11)
effective our subreddit and I think (5:08 - 5:13)
about pretty pretty well pretty okay I (5:11 - 5:15)
went through the whole thing and had to (5:13 - 5:16)
correct every time you answered a (5:15 - 5:18)
question I had to be in the correction i (5:16 - 5:22)
answered one thing wrong but it was the (5:18 - 5:24)
it was the one you don't want to get (5:22 - 5:26)
wrong it's the one we completely forgot (5:24 - 5:29)
an entire weekend where all three of us (5:26 - 5:31)
spent time together actually heal you (5:29 - 5:33)
forgot two weekends where all three of (5:31 - 5:34)
us spend time together because you (5:33 - 5:38)
forgot that I was at VGC I forget oh we (5:34 - 5:43)
forgot because i was at 2011-2012 and i (5:38 - 5:47)
think even 2013 and then and then you (5:43 - 5:50)
also forgot that we were all there for (5:47 - 5:52)
was it 649 monsters or Battle City at (5:50 - 5:55)
you are at 16 14 46 49 pastures besides (5:52 - 5:57)
you know whatever you forget me I (5:55 - 6:02)
honestly don't remember that we can so (5:57 - 6:05)
for that was national as to where we all (6:02 - 6:07)
met for the first time right and yes I (6:05 - 6:09)
remember my very first I met you before (6:07 - 6:12)
that yeah yeah but the question was all (6:09 - 6:14)
three of us in the same room yeah (6:12 - 6:16)
because I got the very first time we met (6:14 - 6:18)
that was that mgc you came in you said (6:16 - 6:20)
hi and then I didn't see you for like a (6:18 - 6:23)
day and a half and then wedded him and (6:20 - 6:25)
very inaccurate statement of that (6:23 - 6:29)
question I came in you were like setting (6:25 - 6:30)
up and you were setting up early and I (6:29 - 6:32)
got there early and I asked if you (6:30 - 6:34)
wanted help with anything and you said (6:32 - 6:37)
no yep that's about me control frankly (6:34 - 6:41)
so I was like okay I guess I'll just do (6:37 - 6:43)
my own thing I'm not gonna stand here in (6:41 - 6:47)
a room and watch Steve put up lights (6:43 - 6:49)
that he bought a guitar center then I (6:47 - 6:52)

my deck I was playing at that time v.v.v (8:18 - 8:25)
you were playing vvv vvv yep but I was I (8:21 - 8:28)
was doing something with I think I was (8:25 - 8:30)
play tete I think I was play testing (8:28 - 8:31)
against a hoe deck because i was playing (8:30 - 8:34)
against Chris Ilic one of the one of our (8:31 - 8:37)
fans down in Indiana he wrote an email (8:34 - 8:39)
like two weeks ago yeah and and I know (8:37 - 8:41)

some friends that I think that he was (8:41 - 8:45)
not there Vinny was not there you're (8:43 - 8:47)
right that was that I was here with his (8:45 - 8:49)
girlfriend's episode is gonna be so long (8:47 - 8:51)
as we just hash out the details of (8:49 - 8:53)
something that what do listeners care (8:51 - 8:55)
about this yes what they asked it in the (8:53 - 8:57)
reddit a sniffing know that this so I (8:55 - 9:00)
remember I remember that deck so well (8:57 - 9:02)
and I remember I remember will being (9:00 - 9:04)
there because he had a shaved head at (9:02 - 9:06)
that time correct and then I remember (9:04 - 9:09)
participating in the tournament (9:06 - 9:12)
I pretty much got eliminated because I (9:09 - 9:14)
was playing against i was playing vvv (9:12 - 9:19)
vanilluxe Victini which is a very Ricky (9:14 - 9:20)
rolling dice kind of deck and I was (9:19 - 9:23)
playing a good night Lou know as playing (9:20 - 9:26)
against a valiant deck that kobata so (9:23 - 9:28)
vanilluxe in the in the TCG is weak (9:26 - 9:31)
against steel and there are no one plays (9:28 - 9:33)
steel decks in the TCG even to this day (9:31 - 9:36)
I was winning that match and we went (9:33 - 9:39)
into overtime and I was I was so far (9:36 - 9:42)
ahead winning we went into overtime so (9:39 - 9:44)
like I you get everyone gets you get (9:42 - 9:46)
three turns zero so everyone gets you (9:44 - 9:47)
get two turns really but they say three (9:46 - 9:49)
turns its 0 for you one for your (9:47 - 9:51)
opponent to for you three for your (9:49 - 9:54)
opponent game set and give ends so I was (9:51 - 9:55)
upper prize when we went into overtime (9:54 - 9:59)
the dude realized at the end of the game (9:55 - 10:02)
that he had the the that I was weak (9:59 - 10:05)
against steel so he called the judge (10:02 - 10:08)
over and the judge reversed it to the (10:05 - 10:11)
point where i was i was turned 0 for me (10:08 - 10:12)
and i was in a position where i couldn't (10:11 - 10:15)
win at all anymore even though i (10:12 - 10:18)
completely took my turn which put me (10:15 - 10:21)
like secured my win but the judge rolled (10:18 - 10:24)
back an entire move which is like (10:21 - 10:27)
unheard of to like you ok so usually in (10:24 - 10:29)
the TCG if you have completed your move (10:27 - 10:31)
and you have gone on and your opponent's (10:29 - 10:34)
there that move is set in stone everyone (10:31 - 10:37)
is satisfied and there are exceptions to (10:34 - 10:39)
that but like I don't know I was very (10:37 - 10:40)
upset and that's all I remember from (10:39 - 10:43)
that trip I was I remember vvv I (10:40 - 10:44)
remember meeting will with no hair I (10:43 - 10:46)
remember being extremely upset about (10:44 - 10:48)
that rule call and I remember nothing (10:46 - 10:50)
else I certainly remember you being (10:48 - 10:52)
extremely upset and one other thing I (10:50 - 10:55)
remember is that Irene was playing TCG (10:52 - 10:57)
at that time and her first match was at (10:55 - 11:01)
table 1 again yeah the guys from the (10:57 - 11:05)
what was that entire video top cut yep (11:01 - 11:08)
yes she won and she beat him and pretty (11:05 - 11:10)
much and he he he was so now he known as (11:08 - 11:13)
a better player yeah yeah totally but (11:10 - 11:14)
that that wasn't my first match though (11:13 - 11:16)
against the Cabal and I think that that (11:14 - 11:18)
might have been my third or fourth match (11:16 - 11:21)
of the day I remember you get in pretty (11:18 - 11:22)
sour that what that was I that was (11:21 - 11:23)
pretty much my (11:22 - 11:24)
match of the day like I knew at that (11:23 - 11:26)
point there was no point in continuing (11:24 - 11:28)
playing I was like of course you like (11:26 - 11:31)
quote unquote play for fun but now I (11:28 - 11:34)
like that deck alot though anyways how (11:31 - 11:35)
did you guys feel about the reddit (11:34 - 11:37)
overall the reddit the the reddit (11:35 - 11:40)
questions ed vana I wish there had been (11:37 - 11:42)
more questions and it was kind of at an (11:40 - 11:44)
odd time of day for me since it was in (11:42 - 11:46)
the middle of the workday and I was at (11:44 - 11:47)
work but I did my best to answer what I (11:46 - 11:49)
could but yeah I just wish there had (11:47 - 11:51)
been more people I'd ask more questions (11:49 - 11:53)
other words good mix I thought there was (11:51 - 11:54)
a better turnout to begin with (11:53 - 11:56)
especially since it was such a short (11:54 - 11:59)
notice and pet at the time of day right (11:56 - 12:02)
I don't know I'm on reddit 24-7 at work (11:59 - 12:05)
real well that's all I have to say about (12:02 - 12:09)
reddit 0 but it was fun if you missed (12:05 - 12:11)
that that obviously reddit hold on to (12:09 - 12:13)
everything so you can just go to our (12:11 - 12:15)
subreddit and it should be there on the (12:13 - 12:16)
front page somewhere so check that out (12:15 - 12:21)

well Pokemon podcast holds Pokemon (12:45 - 12:50)
podcast is just the long term for P came (12:48 - 12:52)
and cast right because when you see pkmn (12:50 - 12:56)
you that's just Pokemon and cast is (12:52 - 12:58)
usually just short for podcasts so it (12:56 - 13:01)

lucario of this generation i feel that (14:35 - 14:41)
is a terrible comparison yeah but (14:37 - 14:45)
Lucario's like bad and top of cocos cool (14:41 - 14:48)
tocayo goes real chill tópico goes like (14:45 - 14:50)
the Victini i think we needed pretty ok (14:48 - 14:53)
as like no like aaron existed (14:50 - 14:56)
objectively it's like the zapdos of this (14:53 - 14:59)
generation magan's aptos didn't get like (14:56 - 15:01)
that much lime light compared to like (14:59 - 15:05)
Mewtwo in Mew oh I mean I mean I get (15:01 - 15:08)
sometimes just a girl where your metric (15:05 - 15:11)
is like that dose got like in the second (15:08 - 15:13)
movie you get Zapdos right but you also (15:11 - 15:15)
get Articuno and you also get Moltres (15:13 - 15:18)
here I feel like we're just getting top (15:15 - 15:20)
of cocoa and the only reason tabu ley (15:18 - 15:22)
ley is in the conversation is because of (15:20 - 15:24)
EG seas but we're still not like you (15:22 - 15:25)
don't still see that and then you know (15:24 - 15:28)
what here's the correct comparison top (15:25 - 15:31)
of cocoa is the suicune of this (15:28 - 15:35)
generation that's another member of a (15:31 - 15:38)
trilogy that gets in the games and the (15:35 - 15:42)
anime i feel your longer emphasis then (15:38 - 15:48)
its other two trio partners yeah but (15:42 - 15:51)
isn't taboo coo coo 104 yet it's one of (15:48 - 15:53)
us you know November's the quadrilogy (15:51 - 15:56)
yeah the purple one it yet i'm finna (15:53 - 15:58)
yeah top abbulu you got top of lately (15:56 - 16:00)
yeah top of cocoa yeah and Finny see no (15:58 - 16:03)
one remembers fini at least I the way (16:00 - 16:05)
like Jessica dolphin it's the fairy one (16:03 - 16:08)
right there all fairies all right good (16:05 - 16:10)
all right conversation but top of (16:08 - 16:13)
Phineas water fairy got it and then top (16:10 - 16:15)
of Leila is psychic fairy tabu Coco is (16:13 - 16:18)
electric fairy tabu boo Luis grass grass (16:15 - 16:22)
yeah believe it or not Pokemon go has 65 (16:18 - 16:25)
million active player monthly active (16:22 - 16:29)
players still this is from Forbes there (16:25 - 16:33)
a reputable reputable site that's true (16:29 - 16:35)
ah let me read some of this article I (16:33 - 16:38)
won't read it all but ooh this article (16:35 - 16:40)
references references destiny I forgot (16:38 - 16:42)
about that putting that 65 million (16:40 - 16:44)
number in context is a little tough (16:42 - 16:46)
given the very nature of the video game (16:44 - 16:49)
industry last year mobile giant (16:46 - 16:52)
supercell reported that it had 450 (16:49 - 16:54)
million monthly users between clash of (16:52 - 16:57)
clans boom beach clash royale and its (16:54 - 16:59)
other games though the company has (16:57 - 17:02)
almost unparalleled success in the (16:59 - 17:04)
industry so it's definitely an outlier (17:02 - 17:07)
elsewhere destiny had about 30 million (17:04 - 17:09)
monthly players at its peak call a duty (17:07 - 17:12)
had 40 million all Blizzard games had (17:09 - 17:14)
about 42 million combined of last year (17:12 - 17:16)
though almost all those titles have (17:14 - 17:18)
upfront costs league legends the (17:16 - 17:21)
free-to-play MOBA boasted a few months (17:18 - 17:23)
ago that its popularity has only (17:21 - 17:25)
increased in time and now it's up to a (17:23 - 17:28)
hundred million monthly players so even (17:25 - 17:30)
with its diverse range in titles 65 (17:28 - 17:34)
million players is this far after a lot (17:30 - 17:35)
the launch for Pokemon go is certainly (17:34 - 17:38)
still impressive it's absolutely more (17:35 - 17:39)
than I would have imagined I being the (17:38 - 17:42)
author but monthly players are not daily (17:39 - 17:44)
players but people log in twice a month (17:42 - 17:45)
to see if anything's different aren't (17:44 - 17:49)
exactly going to be big cash cows go may (17:45 - 17:51)
not be able to monetize monthly players (17:49 - 17:54)
quite as well as other games with much (17:51 - 17:57)
more aggression aggression transaction (17:54 - 17:59)
mechanics and yet it is still one of the (17:57 - 18:01)
highest grossing games (17:59 - 18:03)
according to most estimates as of this (18:01 - 18:06)
article i'm pretty sure pokemon go is (18:03 - 18:09)
still hovering around the top 10 in the (18:06 - 18:13)
apple itunes app store under downloads (18:09 - 18:16)
or highest grossing or under under (18:13 - 18:19)
grossing i could probably check i'll do (18:16 - 18:21)
my pokemon go update here have you guys (18:19 - 18:25)
been playing or no no I have not no I (18:21 - 18:28)
just I don't know it's still too cold (18:25 - 18:30)
and I still don't really think to play (18:28 - 18:33)
it when I'm indoors and just sitting (18:30 - 18:35)
there and spinning the same pokey stop (18:33 - 18:36)
every 10 minutes is not at all (18:35 - 18:38)
entertaining to me so I don't do that (18:36 - 18:40)
and it's you know it's supposed to snow (18:38 - 18:45)
tonight hi April in Michigan great fun (18:40 - 18:50)
cool love it snow cool oh yeah it's (18:45 - 18:52)
still too cold so still not playing it (18:50 - 18:55)
pokeman go right now is number 14 of the (18:52 - 18:57)
top-grossing in itunes so it's pretty (18:55 - 19:00)
good candy crush is right above it yeah (18:57 - 19:01)
i'm kind of disturbed that tinder is (19:00 - 19:03)
number 10 i was like what are you paying (19:01 - 19:06)
for in there now don't you pay for I've (19:03 - 19:08)
never used tinder but don't you pay for (19:06 - 19:11)
like more swipes don't you run out of (19:08 - 19:13)
swipes at a certain point I don't think (19:11 - 19:16)
so pretty wild if that's true the only (19:13 - 19:18)
thing I remember that you know this is (19:16 - 19:20)
going to be a prob with right the only (19:18 - 19:22)
thing I remember that you would have to (19:20 - 19:24)
pay for in tinder is if you wanted to be (19:22 - 19:25)
able to hide yourself from your family (19:24 - 19:28)
and friends oh I think maybe you can pay (19:25 - 19:30)
maybe this was an okcupid thing where (19:28 - 19:33)
when you look at somebody's profile they (19:30 - 19:35)
know you looked at it so they can look (19:33 - 19:37)
at you but I think if you pay you can (19:35 - 19:39)
look at people without them knowing you (19:37 - 19:41)
looked at them I think that specifically (19:39 - 19:43)
on tinder because you have to sign up (19:41 - 19:45)
for tinder with facebook yes if you pay (19:43 - 19:47)
it goes through your facebook family and (19:45 - 19:50)
friends and they have tinder account so (19:47 - 19:53)
they don't ever see you I see you na you (19:50 - 19:56)
have to pay for that feature is that (19:53 - 19:59)
disturbing as a little weird is there (19:56 - 20:01)
any tinder podcast can we monopolize (19:59 - 20:04)
here I would not down to do at ICAST no (20:01 - 20:06)
I would not we can merge it with like a (20:04 - 20:09)
snapchat podcast we can get both markets (20:06 - 20:11)
in one I feel like if you're a tinder (20:09 - 20:13)
user you're also a snapchat user well (20:11 - 20:15)
I'm definitely either so I'm (20:13 - 20:18)
your theory is definitely what I voted (20:15 - 20:20)
by your theory because I've never had (20:18 - 20:23)
either all right got another news (20:20 - 20:26)
article from BBC News here might be a (20:23 - 20:29)
touchy topic so I'll turn off my joking (20:26 - 20:32)
voice here his Pokemon go helping stop (20:29 - 20:35)
suicide at hotspots in Japan Japan has (20:32 - 20:37)
one of the highest suicide rates in the (20:35 - 20:39)
world but one notorious beaut beautiful (20:37 - 20:42)
spot has noted a welcome and unexpected (20:39 - 20:44)
lack of deaths this year a fact (20:42 - 20:47)
attributed to an unseen factor Pokemon (20:44 - 20:51)
go there was an interview at BBC I don't (20:47 - 20:54)
want to go into the details of of death (20:51 - 20:56)
rates here but he suspects Pokemon go (20:54 - 20:58)
the wildly popular mobile game in which (20:56 - 21:00)
people catch virtual characters in (20:58 - 21:02)
physical locations could be behind it (21:00 - 21:04)
drawing crowds in pursuit of rare (21:02 - 21:06)
creatures to breathe air the Pokemon go (21:04 - 21:10)
effect is huge he is the author or the (21:06 - 21:11)
person being interviewed told the (21:10 - 21:13)
Japanese the Japanese news website dot (21:11 - 21:16)
in Japanese we hope I hope we can (21:13 - 21:18)
continue at this pace with zero suicides (21:16 - 21:21)
Vicky sorry G director of tell life live (21:18 - 21:23)
a counseling and mental health service (21:21 - 21:26)
for Japan's international community told (21:23 - 21:27)
the BBC the decline was a positive (21:26 - 21:29)
development she said there was probably (21:27 - 21:31)
a number of factors to play including a (21:29 - 21:34)
chance in the decline but that it may be (21:31 - 21:37)
that the game has had an impact most (21:34 - 21:38)
people who choose to take their own (21:37 - 21:40)
lives so do it so in a private place (21:38 - 21:43)
often they're home she says since the (21:40 - 21:44)
game has come out there's been many (21:43 - 21:47)
media reports of crowds of gamers at the (21:44 - 21:50)
toes Jimbo suggesting that it is no (21:47 - 21:52)
longer the same appeal for those seeking (21:50 - 21:55)
isolation with media attention and a (21:52 - 21:57)
major factor in drawing people to (21:55 - 21:59)
suicide hot spots it's not impossible (21:57 - 22:01)
that different coverage of this area's (21:59 - 22:03)
help changing its reputation time of (22:01 - 22:05)
this year can be especially tough spring (22:03 - 22:07)
often seasonal sees a rise in suicides (22:05 - 22:09)
around the world but it is particularly (22:07 - 22:13)
pronounced in Japan miss surge oki says (22:09 - 22:15)
where April is the start of the school (22:13 - 22:18)
year financial year and where many local (22:15 - 22:19)
companies take on new staff and move (22:18 - 22:22)
existing staff around there's a lot of (22:19 - 22:23)
stress around this time but with a (22:22 - 22:25)
greater willingness to talk about mental (22:23 - 22:27)
health and an increase in services (22:25 - 22:29)
offering to listen Japan may (22:27 - 22:30)
be slowly getting a grip on a suicide (22:29 - 22:32)
problem so I don't know if I said this I (22:30 - 22:35)
apologize beginning the article the the (22:32 - 22:37)
spot we're talking about is is like this (22:35 - 22:40)
cliff area that's touching the ocean (22:37 - 22:43)
it's it's actually really quite (22:40 - 22:46)
beautiful but that place in particular (22:43 - 22:50)
was known for suicides so what do you (22:46 - 22:52)
guys think about this obviously not a (22:50 - 22:54)
joking matter but I think it's important (22:52 - 22:56)
and I think that overall it's it's good (22:54 - 22:58)
news right like mental health is (22:56 - 23:01)
something that's more openly talked (22:58 - 23:04)
about and I think that's a good thing so (23:01 - 23:07)
I would say two things to just to keep (23:04 - 23:08)
in mind when thinking about the article (23:07 - 23:14)
one is if there are more people going to (23:08 - 23:16)
toe Jimbo because there's polka stops (23:14 - 23:19)
and Pokemon there it may just mean that (23:16 - 23:21)
people are looking to other locations (23:19 - 23:24)
yeah yeah so it may just have shifted (23:21 - 23:26)
the statistic to a different place so (23:24 - 23:28)
that the right they weren't staying an (23:26 - 23:31)
overall reduction didn't say they just (23:28 - 23:32)
say in the article that it's been less (23:31 - 23:36)
less what at that location or was it (23:32 - 23:39)
just less overall I believe less overall (23:36 - 23:42)
but so technically that location I did I (23:39 - 23:43)
sorry I skimmed the article there was I (23:42 - 23:46)
didn't want to report the actual numbers (23:43 - 23:49)
mm-hmm well those are their big numbers (23:46 - 23:50)
but the other thing I would say also is (23:49 - 23:52)
one thing I remember I was watching a (23:50 - 23:55)
documentary once about the Golden Gate (23:52 - 23:57)
Bridge and you know that's also a (23:55 - 24:01)
popular place for suicides and one thing (23:57 - 24:04)
that one of the people who had basically (24:01 - 24:06)
been stopped from committing suicide (24:04 - 24:08)
there said was you know as I was walking (24:06 - 24:11)
along the bridge if one person had (24:08 - 24:14)
smiled at me and like said good morning (24:11 - 24:17)
I completely would have changed my mind (24:14 - 24:20)
but it's like nobody looked at me and (24:17 - 24:22)
that just you know maybe more committed (24:20 - 24:23)
and it's like if people are out playing (24:22 - 24:26)
pokemon go they're generally in a (24:23 - 24:28)
happier friendlier mood right because (24:26 - 24:30)
they're out a grating yeah playing they (24:28 - 24:32)
might be more willing to like if they (24:30 - 24:34)
see somebody else like extend it like (24:32 - 24:35)
with me I'm adamant like when I'm (24:34 - 24:38)
walking my dog I'm like the most (24:35 - 24:41)
aggressive good morning person you'll (24:38 - 24:42)
ever meet like (24:41 - 24:44)
I always smile and say good morning to (24:42 - 24:47)
every single person I pass just because (24:44 - 24:50)
I mean that's that's just me I a I mean (24:47 - 24:52)
even in Milwaukee when you when you (24:50 - 24:54)
stayed with me and you went for a run (24:52 - 24:56)
you would you you you came back kind of (24:54 - 24:58)
joking kind of serious but when you (24:56 - 24:59)
would say good morning to people (24:58 - 25:01)
Milwaukee and they didn't really they (24:59 - 25:02)
were like I did it would give me a look (25:01 - 25:06)
like why is this person talking to ya no (25:02 - 25:08)
but I can believe it I agree with you on (25:06 - 25:10)
the aspect of Pokemon go players at (25:08 - 25:13)
least I I will never forget the summer (25:10 - 25:15)
and I will never ever forget the summer (25:13 - 25:18)
Pokemon go came out and just the amount (25:15 - 25:20)
of people playing and the chest how (25:18 - 25:22)
friendly everyone was to each other I've (25:20 - 25:27)
lived in milwaukee for 28 years and like (25:22 - 25:29)
I I know I know what the people are (25:27 - 25:31)
alike and I know when I traveled to (25:29 - 25:33)
Chicago or Minnesota or New York or (25:31 - 25:36)
Boston those people are dramatically (25:33 - 25:37)
different than the people in the walking (25:36 - 25:39)
well not dramatically but in some (25:37 - 25:42)
aspects yes seeing the Pokemon go phase (25:39 - 25:45)
hit like there was absolutely without a (25:42 - 25:48)
doubt in my mind just more positivity in (25:45 - 25:49)
those parks in those neighborhoods (25:48 - 25:54)
between people and I it has made me more (25:49 - 25:56)
confident in a person to like just walk (25:54 - 25:58)
down the street and just say hi to (25:56 - 25:59)
somebody just to say hi to somebody and (25:58 - 26:01)
like it feels good when they say hi back (25:59 - 26:03)
I mean love you don't have having a (26:01 - 26:05)
conversation but it's still like I think (26:03 - 26:07)
that's important yeah and no it's not (26:05 - 26:11)
else's existence yes yeah and regardless (26:07 - 26:14)
of whether or not the this article (26:11 - 26:16)
whether or not the location described in (26:14 - 26:18)
this article is representative of (26:16 - 26:21)
overall statistics generally you know at (26:18 - 26:24)
least the anecdotal evidence from the (26:21 - 26:27)
documentary that that will watch (26:24 - 26:31)
indicates that saying hi in interacting (26:27 - 26:33)
with people has a can have a more (26:31 - 26:35)
profound positive effect than you would (26:33 - 26:37)
anticipate so yeah as long as you're (26:35 - 26:40)
respecting people's boundaries I I love (26:37 - 26:43)
when people interact with me and and and (26:40 - 26:44)
i think that most people are that way (26:43 - 26:47)
and and i think that most people also (26:44 - 26:49)
think i know i shouldn't say anything (26:47 - 26:50)
because i don't want to bother this (26:49 - 26:53)
person but thinking of myself (26:50 - 26:55)
ninety-nine percent of the time if (26:53 - 26:56)
someone says hello to (26:55 - 26:58)
when walking down the street I'm not (26:56 - 27:02)
like oh oh how dare you although (26:58 - 27:04)
apparently the people in Milwaukee are (27:02 - 27:06)
like that but I don't know they're just (27:04 - 27:08)
that they're not excited they're just (27:06 - 27:11)
like confused yeah but yeah I I think I (27:08 - 27:12)
think I speak for the majority of people (27:11 - 27:16)
when I say that it's a very nice feeling (27:12 - 27:19)
to be recognized um yeah so Pokemon (27:16 - 27:21)
podcast fans let's let's say hello to (27:19 - 27:24)
people when we across them on the street (27:21 - 27:26)
yeah yeah I will say that there has been (27:24 - 27:29)
zero reports this year and as opposed to (27:26 - 27:32)
X number last year and X the year before (27:29 - 27:34)
but if this was if you wanted to check (27:32 - 27:37)
out this article it is on the BBC it was (27:34 - 27:39)
april six so very very recent actually (27:37 - 27:42)
today it was reported so it's a BBC / (27:39 - 27:45)
news / world asia should be on the front (27:42 - 27:46)
page even if you're listening to this a (27:45 - 27:48)
couple days later or just use the search (27:46 - 27:50)
feature just thought that would be worth (27:48 - 27:51)
bringing up (27:50 - 27:56)
final better news here is Nintendo might (27:51 - 27:58)
have accidentally revealed that the that (27:56 - 28:01)
Pokemon is coming to the switch this is (27:58 - 28:05)
from the Sun the the celestial body or (28:01 - 28:07)
is this some sort of publication about (28:05 - 28:10)
citepublication poke my own creators (28:07 - 28:12)
believe is something son right it's like (28:10 - 28:16)
the it's the subtle you can Sun the Sun (28:12 - 28:19)
a news UK company is the is the headline (28:16 - 28:23)
yeah I think in the UK there is it's (28:19 - 28:25)
literally just called the Sun kind of (28:23 - 28:29)
like the mirror got it Pokmon creators (28:25 - 28:31)
gamefreak are hiring and eagle-eyed (28:29 - 28:34)
Pikachu fans are insisting that the job (28:31 - 28:37)
adverts to suggest a new pokemon game (28:34 - 28:39)
will be available on intent to switch by (28:37 - 28:42)
the summer of 2018 it is searching for (28:39 - 28:45)
several recruits for a game console in (28:42 - 28:47)
its tokyo studio according to silicon (28:45 - 28:51)
era and several other gaming sites they (28:47 - 28:53)
would be working on a globally popular (28:51 - 28:56)
title which isn't for smartphones they (28:53 - 28:58)
need a cartoon modeler to create (28:56 - 29:00)
exaggerated cartoon style people and (28:58 - 29:03)
monsters they are also in the market for (29:00 - 29:05)
3d graphic designer to work out monsters (29:03 - 29:08)
Nintendo has not hasn't confirmed any (29:05 - 29:10)
extra games for its brand new switch (29:08 - 29:12)
console but Pokemon is one of the most (29:10 - 29:14)
successful games following Mario and (29:12 - 29:17)
Zelda actually pretty confident that it (29:14 - 29:19)
does way better than zelda does it it's (29:17 - 29:21)
not the first time rumors of a new (29:19 - 29:23)
console game have gotten fans pumped a (29:21 - 29:25)
director a director's cut of Pokemon Sun (29:23 - 29:28)
and Moon titled Pokemon stars is said to (29:25 - 29:30)
be in the works but not confirmed so (29:28 - 29:32)
there you go Game Freak is hiring thing (29:30 - 29:34)
about this that is strange to me is that (29:32 - 29:37)
it's it was it's but it sounded like the (29:34 - 29:41)
article said Nintendo was hiring but if (29:37 - 29:44)
it were Pokemon it would presumably be (29:41 - 29:46)
Game Freak right I don't know the (29:44 - 29:49)
article say Game Freak game free oh why (29:46 - 29:51)
the Nintendo switch go that's musta been (29:49 - 29:53)
where I was confused yeah this is just a (29:51 - 29:55)
port of the what does that thing (29:53 - 30:00)
elephant game o.o tambo that game was so (29:55 - 30:02)
bad it is a port of the tempo game to (30:00 - 30:04)
the switch that's all it is I mean that (30:02 - 30:07)
game is monstrous (30:04 - 30:10)
it is cycling light it I don't know why (30:07 - 30:12)
I'm so hard on it maybe just cuz the (30:10 - 30:13)
only opinion I've heard of it is Steve's (30:12 - 30:17)
and I just trust him no no it tempo I (30:13 - 30:19)
would say is closer to like a donkey (30:17 - 30:21)
kong country and in play style but I (30:19 - 30:24)
don't feel like it plays well now to (30:21 - 30:26)
flip that coin another game freak game (30:24 - 30:30)
pocket car jockey which is on the 3ds (30:26 - 30:32)
extremely amazing it is a really really (30:30 - 30:35)
fun game that plays really well it's (30:32 - 30:38)
like solitaire / horse racing and that (30:35 - 30:40)
sounds that sounds really silly but it (30:38 - 30:42)
works really well together and it's it's (30:40 - 30:44)
a really great game I think it's like (30:42 - 30:47)
799 it's dirt cheap so you're looking (30:44 - 30:49)
for some more horses you can you name (30:47 - 30:52)
the horses you can breed the horses your (30:49 - 30:56)
horses can have rolling baby horses ah (30:52 - 30:59)
think there's oh yeah there's a little (30:56 - 31:01)
like what do you call those like little (30:59 - 31:03)
balls that like roll out of a machine (31:01 - 31:05)
and then you break them open like a (31:03 - 31:07)
gotcha pond yeah there's gotcha ponds (31:05 - 31:11)
that's rollin no hay the role they gotta (31:07 - 31:14)
roll out of the machine do they not know (31:11 - 31:17)
yes my answer is no this is not going to (31:14 - 31:18)
happen the horses are really cute too (31:17 - 31:21)
I've seen the horses I have no interest (31:18 - 31:25)
in regards to this article Ida it's hard (31:21 - 31:29)
to react to because we kind of already (31:25 - 31:31)
have reacted to the previous Pokemon (31:29 - 31:33)
stars rumor and it would just be us (31:31 - 31:35)
saying the same things like yeah oh that (31:33 - 31:38)
would be cool hmm I got it it's it's (31:35 - 31:40)
it's difficult to think of anything (31:38 - 31:42)
substantial to say when we've had this (31:40 - 31:46)
rumor fairly recently a very similar (31:42 - 31:49)
rumor very recently and not a lot of the (31:46 - 31:51)
details of change other than Moore's (31:49 - 31:53)
more evidence for its existence like (31:51 - 31:56)
it's difficult to know how to and (31:53 - 31:59)
intelligibly whoo I can't even speak so (31:56 - 32:01)
I'm not gonna end the sun's but you know (31:59 - 32:04)
what I mean yes yes I do yeah we don't (32:01 - 32:07)
have any new info obviously we we do (32:04 - 32:08)
know that Game Freak is working on (32:07 - 32:11)
something it was told that all Nintendo (32:08 - 32:13)
studios are making something for switch (32:11 - 32:15)
assumption was this was going to be (32:13 - 32:17)
something Pokemon related but we don't (32:15 - 32:19)
know that's what everyone wants I (32:17 - 32:19)
suppose (32:19 - 32:22)
but I think everyone also wants a quick (32:19 - 32:25)
break so we will take one and when we (32:22 - 32:27)
come back we're going to do just a (32:25 - 32:29)
couple emails and your pokémon of the (32:27 - 32:32)
week so we will be right back (32:29 - 32:32)
I don't hate how the fellas good areas (32:38 - 32:48)
like boring and bad cell is good I'm (32:44 - 32:56)
interesting Zelda's good there's (32:48 - 33:00)
probably a horse at some point (32:56 - 33:00)
and we are back from our break let's do (33:05 - 33:12)
some emails here so if you have any (33:09 - 33:16)

calm and hit that contact button but (33:29 - 33:35)
both both are acceptable for emails (33:32 - 33:40)
let's do this email from Sam Sam rights (33:35 - 33:42)
India's he has a couple of questions (33:40 - 33:45)
let's uh let's do two of them here first (33:42 - 33:48)
one is do you think that there will be a (33:45 - 33:51)
Pokemon stars or a sin o remake for the (33:48 - 33:56)
3ds switch or boa second question is a (33:51 - 34:00)
bird is a burrito a sandwich thanks for (33:56 - 34:02)
the that no thank you for reading I (34:00 - 34:04)
listen to your show every week please (34:02 - 34:08)
continue making awesome content and says (34:04 - 34:13)
their favorite is Travis ya gotta gotta (34:08 - 34:14)
include your favorite there so you have (34:13 - 34:16)
two questions let's start with the the (34:14 - 34:19)
hard one here is a burrito a sandwich no (34:16 - 34:22)
yes of course I would it be 10 cuz it's (34:19 - 34:24)
a sandwich just trying to make (34:22 - 34:26)
sandwiches surrounded by bread isn't (34:24 - 34:28)
right I wouldn't I wouldn't call it I (34:26 - 34:31)
wouldn't call a wrap a sandwich I would (34:28 - 34:33)
agree isn't a tortilla just Mexican (34:31 - 34:36)
bread no isn't it you know like mostly (34:33 - 34:39)
flour tortilla what did what is bread (34:36 - 34:41)
right is mostly flour no bread is mostly (34:39 - 34:49)
wheat wheat flour flour and wheat or not (34:41 - 34:51)
the same thing that's rather say making (34:49 - 34:53)
it hard you're making it harder and (34:51 - 34:54)
harder to be on this side of the (34:53 - 34:57)
argument timer is made from wheat wheat (34:54 - 35:00)
was its late on wheat flour wheat is (34:57 - 35:04)
like plants flower is like sugar that (35:00 - 35:09)
doesn't taste good no no flour is a (35:04 - 35:12)
product that's made from wheat but I (35:09 - 35:14)
would still say that Turk that I (35:12 - 35:17)
wouldn't call yeah I wouldn't call a (35:14 - 35:18)
wrap let's say (35:17 - 35:21)
which and so therefore burrito is a (35:18 - 35:24)
similar food item so similarly I (35:21 - 35:25)
wouldn't call it a sandwich my grief (35:24 - 35:28)
well you're both wrong so whereas a hot (35:25 - 35:30)
dog is surrounded by bread yeah which is (35:28 - 35:33)
a very sandwich yeah very very important (35:30 - 35:36)
now the second question was a sin o (35:33 - 35:40)
remix stars 3d s which both I feel like (35:36 - 35:42)
we're I'll do the easy part I feel like (35:40 - 35:43)
we're at the point where we're not (35:42 - 35:46)
giving anything on both it's gonna be (35:43 - 35:48)
one to the other I know you mean you (35:46 - 35:52)
mean both consoles or both platforms (35:48 - 35:57)
yeah they did they did do Pokemon uh to (35:52 - 35:58)
the whole goodness what is that worst (35:57 - 36:01)
series of Pokemon games Oh mystery (35:58 - 36:04)
dungeon yes angie was a little across (36:01 - 36:07)
consoles did slit it if had some rough (36:04 - 36:11)
titles recently mr. Desmond would never (36:07 - 36:14)
had a rough title pokemon ranger I've (36:11 - 36:17)
employed it so I I agree there you go (36:14 - 36:19)
you heard it here first there is (36:17 - 36:22)
precedent for releasing the same game on (36:19 - 36:26)
to nintendo nintendo nintendo consoles (36:22 - 36:30)
namely the last Super Smash Brothers was (36:26 - 36:33)
released on both the 3ds and the wii u (36:30 - 36:36)
well Zelda was on switch and wii u yeah (36:33 - 36:38)
but that was that was a promise (36:36 - 36:41)
situation so Smash Brothers was where (36:38 - 36:45)
both were in the in their prime well (36:41 - 36:48)
mm-hmm the prime for we took last two (36:45 - 36:50)
haha but smell like I way i would (36:48 - 36:52)
consider smash brothers a console seller (36:50 - 36:55)
and there was just so many 3d asses out (36:52 - 36:58)
there that that made sense to zelda on (36:55 - 37:01)
the other hand was Zelda is a console (36:58 - 37:03)
seller as we've seen the Nintendo (37:01 - 37:05)
switches me is is selling very well (37:03 - 37:08)
that's because of shovel Knight dude but (37:05 - 37:09)
yeah right that's true shovel Knight is (37:08 - 37:13)
good but it you you started that game on (37:09 - 37:16)
wii u so you would you would be breaking (37:13 - 37:20)
you would probably have way more upset (37:16 - 37:22)
fans to then say like okay this game was (37:20 - 37:24)
planned for Wii U you guys all bodily (37:22 - 37:25)
you for this game but now we're not (37:24 - 37:28)
gonna give it to you especially because (37:25 - 37:30)
like the Wii U and the switch aren't (37:28 - 37:32)
that drastically different in hardware (37:30 - 37:35)
so that that made sense we're now we're (37:32 - 37:37)
at a point where the switch is brand new (37:35 - 37:40)
and the 3ds is what almost seven years (37:37 - 37:42)
old that's weird to think about and (37:40 - 37:45)
there are still reports that 3d Isis are (37:42 - 37:47)
hard to find I feel like you look at the (37:45 - 37:49)
you look at the sales of of the last (37:47 - 37:52)
three pokemon game so you look at x and (37:49 - 37:54)
y you look at Omega Ruby alpha sapphire (37:52 - 37:57)
and then you look at you look at Sun and (37:54 - 38:00)
Moon and you go okay if we release stars (37:57 - 38:03)
a version that we know won't sell as (38:00 - 38:06)
well as x and y or sun and moon it will (38:03 - 38:08)
probably sell as well as something like (38:06 - 38:10)
I don't even think it would sell as well (38:08 - 38:13)
as Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire because (38:10 - 38:16)
the advantage that that game had is we (38:13 - 38:17)
haven't played it in like ten years (38:16 - 38:20)
whereas we just played Sun and Moon so (38:17 - 38:22)
you look at those sales numbers and you (38:20 - 38:24)
go Omega Ruby alpha sapphire is the (38:22 - 38:26)
least selling game out of the three we (38:24 - 38:28)
really stars we know we're not going to (38:26 - 38:30)
pass those sales so when when you do (38:28 - 38:33)
that investor call you go well we'd only (38:30 - 38:35)
sell this amount whereas you take that (38:33 - 38:38)
to a new console like the switch and you (38:35 - 38:40)
go not only would we probably sell that (38:38 - 38:43)
same amount on a new console we will (38:40 - 38:45)
help push that console we will help push (38:43 - 38:48)
more sales to that console and still (38:45 - 38:50)
solve the same amount and be able to do (38:48 - 38:53)
way more with the game because sun and (38:50 - 38:56)
moon was already like so sluggish and so (38:53 - 38:59)
crippled by the performance of the 3ds i (38:56 - 39:00)
mean i'm not going to disagree i think (38:59 - 39:02)
you're pretty accurate in all those (39:00 - 39:04)
statements wait we didn't we didn't (39:02 - 39:06)
answer the other question we didn't (39:04 - 39:09)
answer the sinnoh remake question which (39:06 - 39:10)
is the goal I'm more interested in oh (39:09 - 39:13)
you would assume there would do and (39:10 - 39:15)
right it seemed like they were pretty (39:13 - 39:20)
hesitant to do the gem 3 remakes I (39:15 - 39:22)
remember both were well in retrospect (39:20 - 39:24)
now I think we know it was before those (39:22 - 39:26)
games were being developed I forgot it (39:24 - 39:29)
was if it was junichi Masuda or someone (39:26 - 39:33)
else tweeted something like or maybe an (39:29 - 39:36)
interview or some higher up at game (39:33 - 39:38)
freak's at something along the lines of (39:36 - 39:41)
we get a lot of requests from our fans (39:38 - 39:46)
for a remake of generation 3 those (39:41 - 39:48)
are very important to me so like will (39:46 - 39:50)
consider this consider it or something (39:48 - 39:52)
and it sounded like the way it was (39:50 - 39:54)
articulated made it sound like I wish I (39:52 - 39:56)
could just link Michael but it's a vague (39:54 - 39:59)
memory from like 10 years ago not that (39:56 - 40:01)
long ago but the vague memory from a (39:59 - 40:03)
long time ago so I can't give it to you (40:01 - 40:04)
but I remember some sort of interview (40:03 - 40:06)
like that happening that made it sound (40:04 - 40:11)
like it was partially a toss-up whether (40:06 - 40:13)
or not Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire (40:11 - 40:15)
we're gonna happen and I don't think (40:13 - 40:18)
there's as rabid demand for a diamond (40:15 - 40:23)
and pearl remake as there was for a gen (40:18 - 40:26)
3 remake but I agree with you there I I (40:23 - 40:29)
think gen 3 fans are some of the most (40:26 - 40:32)
vocal fans in the world but you know (40:29 - 40:34)
we've been doing this podcast for almost (40:32 - 40:38)
seven years now and we've had Pokemon (40:34 - 40:40)
droughts before we've had times where it (40:38 - 40:43)
was like okay not a lot of video game (40:40 - 40:44)
news and that's probably what helps with (40:43 - 40:48)
our episodes that were so TCG focused at (40:44 - 40:49)
the time because you're always getting (40:48 - 40:53)
TCG stuff and for sun and moon just (40:49 - 40:56)
coming out you know not even not even (40:53 - 40:58)
six months ago has it been six months (40:56 - 41:02)
five months ah we're yeah we're at five (40:58 - 41:05)
months cuz it was and over November min (41:02 - 41:08)
gambar end of november so with Sun and (41:05 - 41:11)
Moon one of the the faster selling (41:08 - 41:13)
Pokemon games will probably surpass x (41:11 - 41:16)
and y and sales pretty easily pretty (41:13 - 41:19)
universally loved right people were so (41:16 - 41:22)
happy hm's were gone people loved the (41:19 - 41:24)
the new pokemon people like the new (41:22 - 41:25)
regions people really liked the story (41:24 - 41:28)
like there there's so many things that (41:25 - 41:30)
game has done right everything leading (41:28 - 41:33)
up to sun and moon was done so well in (41:30 - 41:36)
the marketing aspect of i felt like we (41:33 - 41:38)
were getting something pokemon every (41:36 - 41:40)
single week before that game came out (41:38 - 41:42)
but then even when that game came out i (41:40 - 41:44)
felt like we were still getting stuff so (41:42 - 41:47)
having all that lead up to Pokemon Sun (41:44 - 41:49)
and Moon we are now five months (41:47 - 41:51)
disconnected from that game and I feel (41:49 - 41:53)
like we are in one of the biggest (41:51 - 41:57)
Pokemon slumps right now then then we've (41:53 - 42:00)
had in such a long time in years (41:57 - 42:02)
and and i can i can say that by looking (42:00 - 42:04)
at our listener numbers i can say that (42:02 - 42:07)
by trying to scrounge news to report on (42:04 - 42:10)
i could say that just by their account (42:07 - 42:12)
tweeting and just being active it's just (42:10 - 42:16)
we're in a point now where I cannot I (42:12 - 42:18)
just can't believe that it's only been (42:16 - 42:20)
five months and people are pretty done (42:18 - 42:22)
having a conversation about sun and moon (42:20 - 42:24)
like i can believe it because it's (42:22 - 42:27)
happening and what does that say and i'm (42:24 - 42:29)
curious what that what this has to do (42:27 - 42:33)
with the prospect of a diamond and pearl (42:29 - 42:35)
remake in your perspective I think (42:33 - 42:38)
that's needed I mean I oh yeah i mean i (42:35 - 42:40)
don't disagree that there needs to be (42:38 - 42:43)
some sort of pokemon thing to revitalize (42:40 - 42:46)
interest in the franchise but we've had (42:43 - 42:49)
a strange series of having our (42:46 - 42:52)
expectations being broken lately with (42:49 - 42:55)
well if you go back to Gen 5 doing (42:52 - 42:56)
something different for the third (42:55 - 43:00)
version instead doing a black 2 and (42:56 - 43:02)
white 2 which was very different from (43:00 - 43:04)
the tradition of just releasing a third (43:02 - 43:07)
version and then acts and why after that (43:04 - 43:09)
not having any third version out just (43:07 - 43:13)
doing a remake so they've I mean sure (43:09 - 43:15)
the sort of change ups have been (43:13 - 43:18)
centered around the existence or (43:15 - 43:20)
nonexistence of a third version but the (43:18 - 43:22)
fact that there have been switcheroos in (43:20 - 43:25)
the release schedule sort of the release (43:22 - 43:27)
routine that we had gotten used to prior (43:25 - 43:32)
to that to me makes nothing a sure bat (43:27 - 43:37)
like it used to be also am I the only (43:32 - 43:39)
one who feels like diamond and pearl (43:37 - 43:41)
came out like two weeks ago and yet (43:39 - 43:43)
somehow their 10 year old games like (43:41 - 43:46)
dynamo does not feel as old I feel like (43:43 - 43:49)
they're old I do they're they're real (43:46 - 43:51)
old to me diamond and pearl does not (43:49 - 43:56)
feel as old now as Ruby and Sapphire (43:51 - 43:59)
felt a bit before the race release of (43:56 - 44:03)
those those remakes but there but like (43:59 - 44:06)
diamond and pearl I like 10 or 11 years (44:03 - 44:08)
old and (44:06 - 44:10)
ruby and sapphire were like 10 or 11 (44:08 - 44:12)
years old when when omega ruby and alpha (44:10 - 44:14)
sapphire came out it just doesn't feel (44:12 - 44:17)
like that same time difference maybe (44:14 - 44:18)
it's just because I'm getting older and (44:17 - 44:23)
so all the time is racing past me and (44:18 - 44:26)
I'm careening towards my certain death (44:23 - 44:28)
faster and faster but who knows you look (44:26 - 44:31)
at main series games and why i say i (44:28 - 44:33)
feel like we're getting we have to get a (44:31 - 44:35)
diamond and pearl remake eventually as (44:33 - 44:37)
you look at the main series games and (44:35 - 44:40)
besides gen 1 and jen to there they're (44:37 - 44:42)
all you know three to four years apart (44:40 - 44:45)
only being five months away from sun and (44:42 - 44:48)
moon dao it's like okay well we got two (44:45 - 44:50)
years and six months to go before we get (44:48 - 44:53)
generation eight so really we have two (44:50 - 44:56)
years before they even start considering (44:53 - 44:58)
talking about that what do we get in (44:56 - 45:02)
between we r get a remake which would be (44:58 - 45:05)
diamond and pearl one would assume or we (45:02 - 45:08)
get a third version of sun and moon (45:05 - 45:10)
which wouldn't do as well because the (45:08 - 45:12)
third version ever does but that's fine (45:10 - 45:14)
but they know that i think the audience (45:12 - 45:17)
knows that but looking at the success (45:14 - 45:22)
that they had from x and y into Omega (45:17 - 45:24)
Ruby alpha sapphire into sun and moon I (45:22 - 45:26)
felt like that was a non-stop roller (45:24 - 45:28)
coaster of just pokemon pokemon pokemon (45:26 - 45:31)
pokemon and now what are they going to (45:28 - 45:34)
do until generation eight like the in in (45:31 - 45:37)
this two and a half years that we have (45:34 - 45:38)
until generation eight they just can't (45:37 - 45:41)
do pokemon stars I feel like that's not (45:38 - 45:44)
enough they've all have so much momentum (45:41 - 45:47)
going or had going even with with (45:44 - 45:49)
something even with stuff like go that (45:47 - 45:51)
worked that got people back in the (45:49 - 45:53)
Pokemon so to to take all that momentum (45:51 - 45:56)
you had going into Sun and Moon and now (45:53 - 45:59)
just only have 11 game planned and that (45:56 - 46:01)
game is just a remake of the game that (45:59 - 46:04)
you you you bet all your horses on that (46:01 - 46:06)
just doesn't seem right like they have (46:04 - 46:08)
to have something besides a third (46:06 - 46:11)
version what would what adjectives would (46:08 - 46:13)
you put before diamond and pearl to make (46:11 - 46:17)
it remake a fight like Omega Alpha heart (46:13 - 46:20)
soul what adjectives are you gonna put (46:17 - 46:21)
before (46:20 - 46:24)
diamond and pearl propagating diamond (46:21 - 46:26)
lustrous pearl probably something with (46:24 - 46:30)
space-going galactic pearl and timeless (46:26 - 46:32)
diamond that actually sounds already (46:30 - 46:36)
yeah I kind of like that a spatial (46:32 - 46:39)
dymond planar pearl galactic pearl and (46:36 - 46:44)
De Beers diamond oh don't don't know uh (46:39 - 46:48)
yeah I i I've it were told don't that (46:44 - 46:50)
was I mean diamond and pearl selling (46:48 - 46:52)
point was the whole space / time (46:50 - 46:55)
continuum who knows great question (46:52 - 46:57)
though thank you Sam fretting him oh man (46:55 - 46:58)
so many questions here Connor from (46:57 - 47:02)
ontario toronto ontario that that i (46:58 - 47:03)
believe that is in your future home (47:02 - 47:07)
Travis of Kenda it is in Canada it's (47:03 - 47:12)
actually I am closer to ontario now then (47:07 - 47:16)
i would be in when i moved to winnipeg (47:12 - 47:19)
but that's another story for another day (47:16 - 47:22)
I guess hi SBJ and crew this is my first (47:19 - 47:24)
time riding into the podcast I've been (47:22 - 47:26)
listening to the show since fall and it (47:24 - 47:29)
is by far the best Pokemon podcasts have (47:26 - 47:31)
listened to have a few questions to ask (47:29 - 47:34)
the crew what new type of Pokemon would (47:31 - 47:37)
you like to see what is each of your (47:34 - 47:40)
dream teams non-competitive just Pokemon (47:37 - 47:43)
you love and or represent fuel u- (47:40 - 47:46)
skarmory Lucario Glade sceptile melodic (47:43 - 47:49)
and size or sounds like a pretty good (47:46 - 47:52)
team already what mega evolutions would (47:49 - 47:53)
you like to see for certain pokemon i am (47:52 - 47:57)
waiting for megam melodic and finally (47:53 - 47:59)
did you clean your dog today love the (47:57 - 48:02)
show keep up the amazing work Connor man (47:59 - 48:03)
I could probably run through they're (48:02 - 48:04)
gonna have to tell me each question one (48:03 - 48:07)
at a time yeah I've already forgotten (48:04 - 48:09)
that whatever the first one was let's go (48:07 - 48:11)
backwards mega evolution you'd like to (48:09 - 48:13)
see oh I think I've already said I think (48:11 - 48:16)
at one point I said mega Victini let's (48:13 - 48:18)
take a step away from mega Victini and (48:16 - 48:19)
say (48:18 - 48:22)
mega Dunsparce this is gonna be a (48:19 - 48:24)
foreshadowing to Pokemon that I would (48:22 - 48:27)
include in my little favorite personal (48:24 - 48:30)
team but mega gourgeist i would go with (48:27 - 48:33)
a new one i usually say mega farfetch (48:30 - 48:35)
but I'm gonna go with mega hoo Oh (48:33 - 48:39)
interesting hmm dream team (48:35 - 48:41)
non-competitive just Pokemon you love (48:39 - 48:44)
and or feel represent you man mine would (48:41 - 48:47)
probably be like lotad farfetch gold (48:44 - 48:50)
duck chandelure chocolate right don't (48:47 - 48:52)
yell and Alma night there you go oh (48:50 - 48:55)

lie it's so do down all right here we go (49:02 - 49:11)
we got a talonflame we got a wow wow my (49:06 - 49:14)
brain is just not working what's the (49:11 - 49:18)
ferry with the by T's rabanne be no (49:14 - 49:20)
Harry with the Whitey's the Whitey's on (49:18 - 49:23)
the head they're like extra mouths wide (49:20 - 49:27)

Zoroark we got bukhari ie I'm not (49:29 - 49:37)
putting aloe kario on my team I don't (49:35 - 49:39)
like fighting types uh probably (49:37 - 49:43)
reuniclus voluto for a bomb be again I (49:39 - 49:48)
do like wabam be and probably uh what's (49:43 - 49:51)
the dupe eter love dupa turn ever evolve (49:48 - 49:54)
that guy turns into yuck to put her what (49:51 - 49:57)
a silly name it's a silly name but he's (49:54 - 50:00)
a really cute pokemon yeah yeah yeah (49:57 - 50:02)
requin it might be a strange-looking (50:00 - 50:05)
pokemon but it does occupy a very (50:02 - 50:07)
interesting niche competitively because (50:05 - 50:10)
it because of its ability water bubble (50:07 - 50:13)
which does a lot of weird stuff it makes (50:10 - 50:16)
it a very interesting one trick pony (50:13 - 50:18)
because it makes its water-type move so (50:16 - 50:20)
strong that you basically don't want to (50:18 - 50:22)
use anything other than liquidation so (50:20 - 50:23)
you just slap a choice band on there and (50:22 - 50:25)
it's very good at hitting things very (50:23 - 50:28)
hard with liquidation and not very good (50:25 - 50:30)
at anything else well paid resist fire (50:28 - 50:32)
which is good for oh bugger (50:30 - 50:35)
no correct mine is hard to do because (50:32 - 50:39)
there's I'd like a lot of Pokemon uh but (50:35 - 50:41)
i'll just list the ones that want to (50:39 - 50:44)
include and then i'll cut some that (50:41 - 50:46)
aren't gonna make the cut but piloswine (50:44 - 50:51)
vanilluxe slurpuff rabanne be me out on (50:46 - 50:54)
CH crow gourgeist would probably be the (50:51 - 50:59)
seven my top 7 and I gotta cut one it's (50:54 - 51:01)
tough I guess I cut I guess I cut the (50:59 - 51:04)
hunch from that rolling with that like (51:01 - 51:06)
I'm you know more I'm I'm gonna cut (51:04 - 51:08)
gourgeist from that list I like (51:06 - 51:11)
gourgeist a lot but it's it's in my top (51:08 - 51:13)
10 but probably not gonna make it in my (51:11 - 51:17)
top 60 it's gonna be piloswine vanilluxe (51:13 - 51:21)
row bomb be slurpuff meowth and the (51:17 - 51:24)
hunch hunch last last question that (51:21 - 51:27)
there was was what new type would you (51:24 - 51:29)
want to see everyone knows my answer I (51:27 - 51:31)
mean everyone also knows my answer I've (51:29 - 51:34)
been resolute about this all the times (51:31 - 51:36)
this question has been asked which is no (51:34 - 51:41)
new types I can't contain them all I I (51:36 - 51:43)
contain multitudes but I cannot contain (51:41 - 51:46)
multitudes of type information within my (51:43 - 51:48)
but to be fair Sun and Moon has made it (51:46 - 51:52)
really easy with showing you the moves (51:48 - 51:54)
and not needing to memorize all the time (51:52 - 51:59)
true i guess in that case will say i (51:54 - 52:01)
feel like that was a problem that no one (51:59 - 52:03)
thought could be fixed and they fixed it (52:01 - 52:06)
like instantly yeah for me I would say (52:03 - 52:09)
void type so something it embodies (52:06 - 52:12)
emptiness hmm well as Travis is thinking (52:09 - 52:14)
I will say sound type and let me tell (52:12 - 52:17)
you why there are a lot of sound type (52:14 - 52:20)
moves that exist that will play a part (52:17 - 52:24)
in why they could retro actively fits (52:20 - 52:26)
down type into pokemon that already (52:24 - 52:28)
exists I mean your give your Givens or (52:26 - 52:30)
like something like a Loudred or annoy (52:28 - 52:33)
Vern but sound based moves like i said (52:30 - 52:35)
already exists there there's abilities (52:33 - 52:37)
for them too but you have moves like (52:35 - 52:41)
boom burst bug buzz chatter clanging set (52:37 - 52:42)
clanging (52:41 - 52:46)
and banging scales confide disarming (52:42 - 52:48)
voice echoed voice grass whistled growl (52:46 - 52:51)
he'll bail hyper voice metal sound Noble (52:48 - 52:55)
roar parting shot harrisch song relic (52:51 - 52:59)
song roar round screech shadow panic (52:55 - 53:04)
sing snarl snore sparkling araya (52:59 - 53:08)
supersonic and uproar all these moves (53:04 - 53:11)
exist sound type could be possible folks (53:08 - 53:15)
and that would be sparkling aria oh sure (53:11 - 53:17)
sure sure imma said sparkling water I (53:15 - 53:21)
was really into it haha I can't I still (53:17 - 53:24)
can't think of one I don't know I just (53:21 - 53:27)
did my taxes so bureaucrat type I don't (53:24 - 53:32)
know the thing that makes the thing they (53:27 - 53:34)
would have to change a few things for (53:32 - 53:37)
sound type to be possible they would (53:34 - 53:41)
have to pretty wildly change the ability (53:37 - 53:44)
soundproof because soundproof is an (53:41 - 53:47)
ability that prevents damage from well (53:44 - 53:49)
maybe not I guess cuz like levitate (53:47 - 53:52)
museum you in the ground yeah so I guess (53:49 - 53:54)
soundproof just makes me immune to sound (53:52 - 53:57)
sound and ground the the only weird (53:54 - 53:59)
thing with sound type that I would think (53:57 - 54:01)
of is like it's kind of easy like (53:59 - 54:03)
Loudred right now is just normal so you (54:01 - 54:06)
just stick sound type on Loudred and you (54:03 - 54:09)
solve that problem but something like no (54:06 - 54:12)
verne is already dragon flying yeah just (54:09 - 54:14)
take the flying away so it's dragging (54:12 - 54:17)
round then there are weird ones like (54:14 - 54:19)
Magnum like the Magnemite line would (54:17 - 54:21)
arguably need sound type too because (54:19 - 54:24)
they're all about like they're always (54:21 - 54:26)
depicted as like emitting sonic waves (54:24 - 54:27)
and that sort of thing and pretty much (54:26 - 54:31)
all the media with that line so but you (54:27 - 54:33)
can't really take away electric or steel (54:31 - 54:36)
and do it justice so who knows you could (54:33 - 54:38)
add it to like Voltorb an electrode I (54:36 - 54:42)
feel like they somehow put out sound and (54:38 - 54:43)
some well they know sonic boom and stuff (54:42 - 54:46)
think they can learn screech and I feel (54:43 - 54:47)
like electrode can learn at rightlook (54:46 - 54:50)
everything a lot of electric types can (54:47 - 54:52)
learn screech like electabuzz and (54:50 - 54:55)
electivire yeah learn screech (54:52 - 54:57)
maybe they hear the itm some other (54:55 - 54:59)
generation ago and maybe they can't now (54:57 - 55:00)
great question that will do one more (54:59 - 55:03)
email here and then we'll do our pokemon (55:00 - 55:06)
of the week the cody rights in from (55:03 - 55:08)
Pittsburgh hey it's super effective crew (55:06 - 55:11)
firstly I love the show and I can't say (55:08 - 55:13)
any one is my favorite because I love (55:11 - 55:17)
you all anyways ah you recently and (55:13 - 55:19)
frequently hate on pokemon black 2 (55:17 - 55:22)
except for will Will's the man and take (55:19 - 55:23)
back my earlier statement he's my (55:22 - 55:26)
favorite black and white 2 came out when (55:23 - 55:28)
I was in college and my best friend and (55:26 - 55:30)
I made a deal to switch our starter (55:28 - 55:32)
pokemon as soon as we could to our (55:30 - 55:34)
favorite pokemon i swapped mine out for (55:32 - 55:38)
swinub swinub i can't say i said i could (55:34 - 55:42)
never say it swinub swinub oh yes like I (55:38 - 55:45)
love swine yeah so i end up with icicle (55:42 - 55:47)
crash and she swapped hers out force and (55:45 - 55:50)
I'll we also came up with a silly store (55:47 - 55:52)
a silly little story about how we got (55:50 - 55:54)
our pokemon and how we met each other to (55:52 - 55:56)
become rivals we named our rival (55:54 - 55:58)
characters after each other could you do (55:56 - 56:00)
that black way too I feel like this is (55:58 - 56:04)
fake haha why can I don't I saw yeah I (56:00 - 56:06)
thought you stop naming rivals in in (56:04 - 56:09)
like diamond and pearl I can't remember (56:06 - 56:11)
anyways no you could definitely name (56:09 - 56:12)
your diamond and pearl rival cuz you (56:11 - 56:14)
could name Barry whatever you want oh (56:12 - 56:17)
yeah yeah Perry Perry rocks it was the (56:14 - 56:19)
best time I ever had in Pokemon because (56:17 - 56:21)
of the way we played it soul Silver's (56:19 - 56:22)
probably stole my favorite all-time (56:21 - 56:24)
favorite pokemon game but black and (56:22 - 56:25)
white 2 has such a special place in my (56:24 - 56:27)
heart have you guys ever swapped out (56:25 - 56:30)
your starter Pokemon early on to switch (56:27 - 56:33)
up gameplay how about do a Nuzlocke (56:30 - 56:35)
adventure where were your were what were (56:33 - 56:38)
your experiences like it either love the (56:35 - 56:40)
show keep up the good work love and (56:38 - 56:44)
peace etc etc Cody so through my (56:40 - 56:47)
playthrough of Omega Ruby I yeah I (56:44 - 56:49)
brought a team in x and y and (56:47 - 56:51)
transferred the eggs over to Omega Ruby (56:49 - 56:54)
and hatch the eggs there and played it (56:51 - 56:59)
with that team and ditched oh oh who did (56:54 - 57:01)
I start with Swampert that middle Mudkip (56:59 - 57:03)
ditch that guy as quickly as possible (57:01 - 57:05)
pulled this story I pulled this email (57:03 - 57:08)
for the story as for the question I (57:05 - 57:09)
don't think I've ever (57:08 - 57:12)
swap stuff but when diamond and pearl (57:09 - 57:13)
came out and I picked it up with my (57:12 - 57:17)
friend uh we would stop at every city (57:13 - 57:19)
like every major city we would battle (57:17 - 57:22)
each other which was pretty cool until (57:19 - 57:23)
they they got angry and quit the game (57:22 - 57:27)
but that was like sick those five cities (57:23 - 57:30)
of like okay we're we're both level 15 (57:27 - 57:32)
let's battle okay we're both level 22 (57:30 - 57:34)
now let's battle it was just like a cool (57:32 - 57:37)
way to have it like an additional rival (57:34 - 57:39)
in the game (57:37 - 57:42)
well that that'll do it for emails if (57:39 - 57:45)
like I said it prior to emails if you (57:42 - 57:46)
have any emails you can send those to (57:45 - 57:50)
SBJ at pkmn casscom or just go to (57:46 - 57:53)
Pokemon podcast.com and hit that email (57:50 - 57:55)
button at the top of the page and (57:53 - 57:59)
that'll go to my inbox oh sorry I (57:55 - 58:01)
fertile II forgot the what I was going (57:59 - 58:03)
to say about that last email i was going (58:01 - 58:07)
to say that they said that black and (58:03 - 58:10)
white 2 was one of their favorites and (58:07 - 58:11)
then they explained the story to follow (58:10 - 58:14)
black and white 2 and I think that's I (58:11 - 58:16)
think that's important and I think (58:14 - 58:19)
that's why a lot of people like gem 3 (58:16 - 58:22)
because that was probably some of their (58:19 - 58:25)
very first games and I think and at (58:22 - 58:28)
least in my in my shoes I I missed out (58:25 - 58:30)
on jun 3 that was when I fell out of (58:28 - 58:32)
Pokemon so when I when I went back to it (58:30 - 58:33)
after playing diamond pearl I was like (58:32 - 58:35)
yeah this is fine but there was no (58:33 - 58:39)
there's no story there for me whereas I (58:35 - 58:41)
just told the story that i had with with (58:39 - 58:44)
diamond and pearl and black and white 2 (58:41 - 58:46)
I felt like was the same thing where (58:44 - 58:48)
there was no story there like I got it I (58:46 - 58:50)
played a little bit of it I was unhappy (58:48 - 58:53)
with how it looked on the 3ds and I (58:50 - 58:55)
didn't have a d/s anymore because i sold (58:53 - 58:58)
it for some reason the the very first 3d (58:55 - 59:00)
esas emulated DS games very poorly and (58:58 - 59:03)
it looked really bad that that's really (59:00 - 59:06)
all I wanted to say I think you have (59:03 - 59:09)
people that you have people that they're (59:06 - 59:11)
one of the some of their favorite games (59:09 - 59:12)
or because there's there's a story tied (59:11 - 59:15)
to it almost every time which is cool (59:12 - 59:19)
let's shift gears here to Pokemon of the (59:15 - 59:24)
week kind of a funny one that's where I (59:19 - 59:28)
come in it's all you now you miss you in (59:24 - 59:30)
a streaming service I think there's a (59:28 - 59:32)
streaming service called you now oh you (59:30 - 59:34)
want me to set this up a why we picked (59:32 - 59:40)
this pokemon i guess you can sao joao (59:34 - 59:43)
from Sarah be usually tweets the pokemon (59:40 - 59:45)
that are most used in the the current (59:43 - 59:48)
meta of the video game he recently (59:45 - 59:51)
tweeted that slowbro with EVO light was (59:48 - 59:52)
being used (59:51 - 59:55)
and he couldn't believe it and so I (59:52 - 59:58)
didn't really look into that nor thought (59:55 - 60:00)
like I didn't think about it either but (59:58 - 60:02)
I told Travis I was like hey I heard (60:00 - 60:06)
that the Travis the dirt on the street (60:02 - 60:08)
slowbro with EVO lights getting a lotta (60:06 - 60:14)
you know what and it's like no I don't (60:08 - 60:20)
know where no no wonder I'm the one that (60:14 - 60:21)
does the bow come out of the week (60:20 - 60:23)
segment cuz whoever your informant is is (60:21 - 60:26)
missing something here because slowbro (60:23 - 60:28)
can evolve and so would therefore get no (60:26 - 60:33)
usage out of EV light so I so after (60:28 - 60:36)
Travis told me that I went back and I (60:33 - 60:38)
was like where where did I get this (60:36 - 60:41)
sweet dirt from and I dug up the dirt (60:38 - 60:45)
and track down Joe from Serbia and then (60:41 - 60:48)
I thought Joe and give bad information (60:45 - 60:52)
but what Joe is saying was he couldn't (60:48 - 60:54)
believe that people were using evo light (60:52 - 60:56)
with slowbro because it doesn't actually (60:54 - 61:00)
work but celebra made it as high as the (60:56 - 61:03)
80th most used pokemon in video King (61:00 - 61:08)
meta so I felt like well I guess slow (61:03 - 61:09)
burrows doing pretty well on its own (61:08 - 61:11)
with technically no held item at this (61:09 - 61:14)
point well it's not like evo light was (61:11 - 61:17)
the most used held item in those (61:14 - 61:20)
statistics or anything it was one of the (61:17 - 61:22)
lower use one of the least used held (61:20 - 61:24)
items in the statistics it's just (61:22 - 61:26)
surprising that people use it at all (61:24 - 61:28)
because it does literally nothing yes (61:26 - 61:31)
cuz slowbro doesn't evolve into slowking (61:28 - 61:34)
slow barreto does that's the confusion (61:31 - 61:37)
and it can also learn the move confusion (61:34 - 61:41)
our it looks like we've got just the one (61:37 - 61:44)
move set for this week I think we're (61:41 - 61:46)
confusing folks by doing it on to (61:44 - 61:49)
Thursday's in a row so we've only got (61:46 - 61:53)
the one this is coming from Kevin Soria (61:49 - 61:59)
that's 252 evs and HP 252 in defense and (61:53 - 62:01)
foreign special defense with a bold (61:59 - 62:04)
nature the ability regenerator one of my (62:01 - 62:06)
favorite abilities (62:04 - 62:10)
it will heal the Pokemon that has (62:06 - 62:12)
regenerator when it switches out it's (62:10 - 62:14)
not quite as good and doubles as it is (62:12 - 62:16)
in singles but as you can imagine (62:14 - 62:18)
singles it makes for great Pokemon to (62:16 - 62:20)
pivot with you can switch to a Pokemon (62:18 - 62:22)
it takes a hit and then when you need to (62:20 - 62:25)
switch that Pokemon out to get a better (62:22 - 62:29)
matchup the Pokemon the you switch out (62:25 - 62:31)
with regenerator gains health and it's (62:29 - 62:33)
very good still fairly useful in doubles (62:31 - 62:35)
because there is still switching in (62:33 - 62:37)
doubles but just not quite as much but (62:35 - 62:39)
it's still really strong ability with (62:37 - 62:43)
leftovers as the held item as you can (62:39 - 62:45)
expect from the EV spread that has no (62:43 - 62:48)
attack or a special attack investment (62:45 - 62:52)
this is a mostly support set or (62:48 - 62:56)
defensive set rather with scald slack (62:52 - 63:01)
off trick room and then either psyshock (62:56 - 63:07)
or Calm Mind scald is even though it was (63:01 - 63:10)
nerfed this generation still a very (63:07 - 63:12)
strong move it's been a strong move (63:10 - 63:15)
since its introduction the ability to (63:12 - 63:17)
slap a burn on something is very strong (63:15 - 63:20)
and it's just ate good water type same (63:17 - 63:23)
type attack bonus move slack off is an (63:20 - 63:25)
incredible move to recover some HP get (63:23 - 63:29)
fifty percent of it back trick room is (63:25 - 63:32)
always going to be an important force in (63:29 - 63:35)
the doubles metagame to do some speed (63:32 - 63:39)
control and then (63:35 - 63:41)
sighs shock would be in there for same (63:39 - 63:44)
type attack bonus with psychic if you (63:41 - 63:46)
need you know something to deal super (63:44 - 63:48)
effective damage to like a fighting type (63:46 - 63:53)
or a poison-type I suppose although I'm (63:48 - 63:56)
struggling to think of a poison-type (63:53 - 63:58)
that psychic would hit super effective (63:56 - 64:03)
that's getting a lot of usage like muck (63:58 - 64:06)
you have a MUX also dark type so that's (64:03 - 64:08)
not going to do anything so yeah I'm not (64:06 - 64:11)
sure psychic nail Lego or nail ago (64:08 - 64:13)
however you supposed to say that ultra (64:11 - 64:15)
beasts name gets a fair amount of making (64:13 - 64:18)
it there yeah I guess it's like nihilism (64:15 - 64:21)
isn't it yeah but anyway then the other (64:18 - 64:26)
move choice for that fourth slot Kevin (64:21 - 64:30)
recommends call mind which allows you to (64:26 - 64:34)
be able to do a little more if the game (64:30 - 64:36)
starts to go long you know having a (64:34 - 64:39)
Pokemon with multiple stat bonuses can (64:36 - 64:42)
be very good late-game missing and kind (64:39 - 64:44)
of once you've knocked out a few Pokemon (64:42 - 64:48)
that might threaten slowbro can make it (64:44 - 64:52)
very difficult to deal with yet slowbro (64:48 - 64:56)
it's a cool pokemon its a good bro (64:52 - 64:59)
the breast of bros (64:56 - 65:02)
a shiny slowbro will be purple instead (64:59 - 65:05)
of pink and have more of a brownish (65:02 - 65:09)
shells of a grey show I much-improved (65:05 - 65:13)
shiny looks a little like Barney some (65:09 - 65:15)
trivia here despite it being commonly (65:13 - 65:18)
known and accept accepted fact that (65:15 - 65:21)
shelter triggers its evolution mention (65:18 - 65:23)
in most of its pokedex entries slow (65:21 - 65:25)
burrows evolution from slowpoke has (65:23 - 65:27)
nothing to do with shelter in the core (65:25 - 65:31)
series unlike how the evolution of man (65:27 - 65:35)
tyke requires remoraid mega slow bro is (65:31 - 65:37)
tied with a cloister for the highest (65:35 - 65:40)
defense base stat of all water-type (65:37 - 65:42)
pokemon mega slow bro has the highest (65:40 - 65:45)
defense set of all psychic type pokemon (65:42 - 65:48)
slow bros pokedex entries states that if (65:45 - 65:51)
the shelter is removed it reverts to its (65:48 - 65:55)
slow pokes form this is only a (65:51 - 65:57)
mentioning by Pokemon possibly devolving (65:55 - 66:00)
any Pokemon in the game aside from the (65:57 - 66:02)
card game and game versions of the TCG (66:00 - 66:05)
many pokémon are noted to evolve by two (66:02 - 66:09)
or more Pokemon combinations such as (66:05 - 66:11)
matang being formed by two Bell domes (66:09 - 66:14)
however the animate does not show this (66:11 - 66:16)
and simply spawns the second Pokemon out (66:14 - 66:19)
of nowhere an example is Morrison's (66:16 - 66:21)
beldam which simply evolved into a (66:19 - 66:23)
matang without needing to join another (66:21 - 66:26)
beldam the evolution of slow poke into (66:23 - 66:30)
slowbro or slow King is the only time (66:26 - 66:33)
that evolution by two Pokemon physically (66:30 - 66:36)
merging is shown mega slow bro also (66:33 - 66:39)
really cool I like Myra Slowbro a lot is (66:36 - 66:42)
it I'll accept it punches the eyes out (66:39 - 66:46)
of the Porsche elder thing is it good (66:42 - 66:49)
competitively or was it never mega slow (66:46 - 66:53)
bro oh never yeah maybe never I don't (66:49 - 66:56)
know enough I think it was mmm I'm gonna (66:53 - 66:58)
try and guess I think it was in like (66:56 - 67:01)
underused or maybe even rarely used in (66:58 - 67:03)
smog on steering to give you an idea let (67:01 - 67:05)
me look (67:03 - 67:07)
what you continue on is mega slow bro (67:05 - 67:09)
did appear in the anime Slowbro (67:07 - 67:12)
obviously in the anime quite a bit and (67:09 - 67:14)
then you have slowking which was was (67:12 - 67:18)
famous for their movie in the second (67:14 - 67:21)
pokemon the movie 2000 do a little bit (67:18 - 67:24)

end of season one of very random (70:01 - 70:06)

the show is designed much like mythical (70:06 - 70:12)
to be lip you can listen from the start (70:09 - 70:15)
of any season and in fact each season (70:12 - 70:17)
we're playing a different role playing (70:15 - 70:20)
game I don't know what it's going to be (70:17 - 70:22)
because we haven't rolled to determine (70:20 - 70:28)
who the DM is yet but the randomly (70:22 - 70:31)
generated role-playing game podcast that (70:28 - 70:32)
