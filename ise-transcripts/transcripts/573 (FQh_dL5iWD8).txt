Pokemon Go stuff the hey Pokemon go is (1:43 - 1:48)
seven years old so we'll talk about that (1:46 - 1:50)
that's crazy to think about uh Pokemon (1:48 - 1:53)
sleep is supposed to be coming soon I (1:50 - 1:55)
went to NAIC which I spelled in the (1:53 - 1:57)
Google Doc wrong (1:55 - 2:00)
um so it's like hmm (1:57 - 2:04)
Del Fox showed up and raids surprise it (2:00 - 2:06)

um and if you want to know if uh (2:06 - 2:12)
Gardevoir tickles your fancy the Pokemon (2:10 - 2:16)
forums are here for you so oh boy (2:12 - 2:20)
uh we have it all today (2:16 - 2:22)

think in the middle of July we'd have (2:22 - 2:26)
nothing to talk about but boy do we have (2:24 - 2:28)
things to talk about (2:26 - 2:29)
hahaha (2:28 - 2:34)
let's start off with uh Pokemon sleep (2:29 - 2:37)
um because there is a well we'll get to (2:34 - 2:39)
there's a Pokemon sleep event happening (2:37 - 2:41)
in Pokemon go (2:39 - 2:42)
um (2:41 - 2:45)
but uh (2:42 - 2:49)
as of two days ago on pokemon.com uh we (2:45 - 2:52)
have Pokemon sleep and Pokemon go plus (2:49 - 2:55)
plus remember it's poorly named uh it's (2:52 - 2:57)
amazingly named it's coming it's (2:55 - 3:00)
amazingly named it's coming somewhere (2:57 - 3:03)
what metric are we using there is my (3:00 - 3:07)
just I want to set the level (3:03 - 3:07)
um so uh full disclosure here before I (3:08 - 3:16)
forget uh there have been at least two (3:12 - 3:19)
Pokemon sleep previews there was one in (3:16 - 3:21)
London which I think some people saw Mr (3:19 - 3:24)
Joe Serebii who is apparently the only (3:21 - 3:25)
British person ever to attend Pokemon (3:24 - 3:27)
events there were other people but most (3:25 - 3:30)
people like look at you uh and I believe (3:27 - 3:33)
there was one in La uh the Pokemon (3:30 - 3:36)
company did invite me to a sleepover (3:33 - 3:38)
which I will be getting on a plane (3:36 - 3:41)
tomorrow to do uh or as if you're (3:38 - 3:42)
listening to this I'm probably already (3:41 - 3:43)
on the plane (3:42 - 3:45)
um so I will be also trying Pokemon (3:43 - 3:48)
sleep in New York so there's just your (3:45 - 3:50)
full disclosure they paid for my flight (3:48 - 3:54)
and hotel for one night of whatever this (3:50 - 3:58)
is I I don't know what to expect also (3:54 - 4:00)
with the amount of strikes happening in (3:58 - 4:02)
the airlines maybe I'll just miss the (4:00 - 4:04)
whole event who knows two things I'm (4:02 - 4:08)
gonna suggest one lock your doors check (4:04 - 4:09)
your kidneys before you go to sleep (4:08 - 4:13)
because this could be harvesting season (4:09 - 4:15)
you never know it is New York it is New (4:13 - 4:18)
York they know you're all coming they (4:15 - 4:19)
all they know you're going to be asleep (4:18 - 4:21)
at a specific time just watch your back (4:19 - 4:24)
is all I'm saying (4:21 - 4:24)
I I (4:24 - 4:28)
feel like there's like a I feel like (4:26 - 4:30)
there's a Pokemon that leads into this (4:28 - 4:32)
but I can't think of the one (4:30 - 4:33)
um (4:32 - 4:36)
so I I don't know I'll I'll I'll let you (4:33 - 4:38)
guys know I guess when I get back or (4:36 - 4:40)
maybe I don't go because again uh last (4:38 - 4:43)
time I took some flights to uh you know (4:40 - 4:46)
Ohio there was uh a lot of people needed (4:43 - 4:49)
to change their flights last minute (4:46 - 4:49)
so who knows (4:50 - 4:53)
there's a lot going on (4:51 - 4:56)
uh this is all pokemon.com though you'll (4:53 - 4:59)
soon be able to rest your very best now (4:56 - 5:01)
that pre-registration has begun for (4:59 - 5:02)
Pokemon sleep on Google Play (5:01 - 5:04)
pre-registration to be notified once the (5:02 - 5:07)
app goes live in Late July they're (5:04 - 5:08)
saying Late July I don't know what they (5:07 - 5:10)
look (5:08 - 5:13)
we know that (5:10 - 5:13)
spring early summer fall winter none of (5:14 - 5:21)
this actually matters because like they (5:18 - 5:23)
don't know what that means when they say (5:21 - 5:26)
like oh the DLC is coming in fall and (5:23 - 5:28)
then the other DLC is coming in Winter (5:26 - 5:31)
who knows what calendar they're looking (5:28 - 5:34)
at for any of that Janine knows and when (5:31 - 5:37)
it's purely digital they have a lot more (5:34 - 5:39)
flexibility because if they're saying (5:37 - 5:44)
winter of 2023 for the second DLC of (5:39 - 5:47)
scarlet and violet that is like a 12 day (5:44 - 5:51)
window it is a 12-day window it is and (5:47 - 5:53)
it's significantly less if you're gonna (5:51 - 5:55)
assume they're not putting it out on (5:53 - 5:57)
Christmas (5:55 - 5:57)
it could be a gift to us all (5:57 - 6:02)
that's true that's true (6:00 - 6:05)
um uh your Pokemon sleep Adventure will (6:02 - 6:07)
take place on a cluster of small Islands (6:05 - 6:10)
you work with large work with a large (6:07 - 6:13)
lovable Snorlax and how do how do we say (6:10 - 6:15)
this name (6:13 - 6:15)
yeah professors studying the Sleep (6:16 - 6:21)
habits of your Pokemon to carry out (6:19 - 6:23)
research and work to complete your sleep (6:21 - 6:27)
style decks you see Pokemon uh will have (6:23 - 6:29)
sleep Styles filled with personality and (6:27 - 6:31)
charm and Beyond being adorable these (6:29 - 6:32)
sleep Styles will also provide a glimpse (6:31 - 6:35)
into Pokemon behaviors start Every (6:32 - 6:38)
Morning by seeing which Pokemon are (6:35 - 6:41)
sleeping in which styles (6:38 - 6:41)
and here they're explaining how the I'm (6:42 - 6:47)
going to air quote Game Works to play (6:44 - 6:49)
Pokemon sleep you'll start off by (6:47 - 6:50)
tracking your sleep at night before (6:49 - 6:52)
studying your sleep styles of Pokemon (6:50 - 6:55)
that have gathered the next morning then (6:52 - 6:56)
during the day you'll be able to raise a (6:55 - 6:59)
Snorlax Snorlax will grow bigger as you (6:56 - 7:02)
sleep more which in turn will attract (6:59 - 7:03)
more Pokemon to your Island allowing you (7:02 - 7:06)
to discover more sleep styles (7:03 - 7:12)
uh they have night time morning day time (7:06 - 7:12)
um (7:13 - 7:15)
you can register another player as a (7:15 - 7:19)
friend you'll be able to share your (7:17 - 7:22)
sleep duration and sleep type with them (7:19 - 7:25)
finally I will know how Greg sleeps you (7:22 - 7:28)
know how I sleep I have slipped I watch (7:25 - 7:31)
this man multiple times I watch this man (7:28 - 7:35)
slam a g fuel at Pax West and then (7:31 - 7:37)
proceed to go to sleep five minutes (7:35 - 7:41)
after as I watched HGTV because I could (7:37 - 7:44)
fall asleep because I had G fuel (7:41 - 7:47)
10 hours earlier and then literally you (7:44 - 7:49)
literally said you shouldn't drink that (7:47 - 7:51)
before bed and I said why you're like (7:49 - 7:53)
well the caffeine will keep you up and I (7:51 - 7:56)
literally said oh yeah watch me and I (7:53 - 7:59)
chugged it and properly fell asleep the (7:56 - 8:01)
science says it does change the quality (7:59 - 8:03)
of your sleep though even if you can go (8:01 - 8:05)
to sleep with caffeine (8:03 - 8:08)
look oh I mean sure I have never had an (8:05 - 8:10)
issue sleeping I will never have an (8:08 - 8:12)
issue sleeping although I have moved (8:10 - 8:15)
into the late age stage where I would (8:12 - 8:17)
now wake up at around four because my (8:15 - 8:19)
body's like (8:17 - 8:22)
you probably need to go to the bathroom (8:19 - 8:24)
and then I will get up some of the (8:22 - 8:25)
bathroom and come back and go back to (8:24 - 8:28)
sleep so that is my new sleep schedule (8:25 - 8:31)
around 4 a.m my buddy's like all right (8:28 - 8:33)
those Pokemon is Pokemon sleep gonna (8:31 - 8:35)
know that you're taking pee breaks I was (8:33 - 8:37)
oh here's the thing is I get to know (8:35 - 8:38)
that my dogs are walking around all the (8:37 - 8:41)
time because literally all they do all (8:38 - 8:42)
night is get in and out of from (8:41 - 8:44)
underneath my blankets (8:42 - 8:45)
that's it yeah that's gonna mess up (8:44 - 8:48)
figure tracking where it's supposed to (8:45 - 8:52)
go because literally Goblin literally (8:48 - 8:54)
next to my head does this all night up (8:52 - 8:57)
under up under these kind of apps are (8:54 - 9:00)
the best when you are the only being in (8:57 - 9:03)
your bed yeah well (9:00 - 9:06)
this is supposed to be on your bed face (9:03 - 9:08)
down screen on (9:06 - 9:11)
and the movement tracking is one of its (9:08 - 9:13)
primary ways of determining how good (9:11 - 9:15)
your sleep is you could you could have (9:13 - 9:16)
one of those like fancy beds you ever (9:15 - 9:18)
see the commercial where like they put (9:16 - 9:21)
like a wine glass on the bed and then (9:18 - 9:23)
they jump up and down and then the wine (9:21 - 9:26)
doesn't spill like what if you I've seen (9:23 - 9:27)
those but you know I have I have a (9:26 - 9:29)
Casper (9:27 - 9:32)
didn't they just file for bankruptcy I (9:29 - 9:33)
don't know (9:32 - 9:36)
I think they did (9:33 - 9:36)
um anyways uh bankruptcy cast uh to get (9:37 - 9:46)
to help get you constant sleep habits (9:42 - 9:48)
Pokemon sleep has a bedtime feature that (9:46 - 9:50)
will let you set a Target time to go to (9:48 - 9:53)
bed by meeting that goal you can earn a (9:50 - 9:55)
stamp on your stamp card and receive (9:53 - 9:59)
rewards okay so I've used probably a (9:55 - 10:02)
half a dozen sleep apps in the past and (9:59 - 10:04)
I can't remember which one it was but (10:02 - 10:06)
there was one app that wouldn't let me (10:04 - 10:09)
say that my bedtime was like past (10:06 - 10:10)
midnight (10:09 - 10:13)
I hate when they do that they realized (10:10 - 10:15)
it means they're not making the app for (10:13 - 10:17)
shift workers right they're like like in (10:15 - 10:18)
a world where like there are (10:17 - 10:20)
construction workers that work at like 4 (10:18 - 10:23)
a.m or you know UPS or not ups that (10:20 - 10:24)
would be a bad example because they're (10:23 - 10:28)
getting up at like 2 A.M but like (10:24 - 10:31)
nurses doctors there's so many people (10:28 - 10:37)
any any fire person any you know any any (10:31 - 10:41)
24-hour Factory has third shift people (10:37 - 10:42)
call centers (10:41 - 10:45)
there's a million people that there are (10:42 - 10:48)
things that are open 24 hours and there (10:45 - 10:50)
are people that have to work the third (10:48 - 10:54)
shift yeah McDonald's sent uh the uh the (10:50 - 10:57)
Cub insert a 24-hour grocery store so I (10:54 - 10:59)
was like well I go to bed at four and I (10:57 - 11:02)
wake up at noon which I don't think is (10:59 - 11:04)
third shift maybe it is third shift it's (11:02 - 11:06)
pretty third Shifty that's third Shifty (11:04 - 11:08)
uh but like I couldn't even set like my (11:06 - 11:11)
bedtime is like 4 a.m like ideally I (11:08 - 11:12)
should be going to bed the same time (11:11 - 11:15)
even though that's you know not the norm (11:12 - 11:17)
for some people for some people it is (11:15 - 11:19)
the norm um but I was like this app is (11:17 - 11:20)
useless to me because it's punishing me (11:19 - 11:23)
that I will never go to sleep on time (11:20 - 11:24)
I'm curious Pokemon sleep will let me (11:23 - 11:28)
say my bedtime's 4 AM (11:24 - 11:32)
it looked like it potentially (11:28 - 11:35)
it looked like he wasn't going to force (11:32 - 11:37)
you to go to sleep at a quote-unquote (11:35 - 11:40)
normal time but do I have to set a time (11:37 - 11:42)
is that my thing like a happy I think (11:40 - 11:43)
you have to say I think you just get a (11:42 - 11:46)
bonus stamp for doing it yes it sounds (11:43 - 11:48)
like you get con you get extras for (11:46 - 11:50)
being consistent (11:48 - 11:52)
wait are you not a consistent bedtime (11:50 - 11:56)
person Greg I feel like you are (11:52 - 11:59)
um it I mean it varies I will go to bed (11:56 - 12:02)
sometime between 11 and 11 30 but if I (11:59 - 12:04)
have to be exact like (12:02 - 12:06)
that ain't (12:04 - 12:08)
that ain't happening if I have to be (12:06 - 12:14)
like I have to be in bed at 11. No Maybe (12:08 - 12:15)
I wonder how it works for like time zone (12:14 - 12:18)
shifts too (12:15 - 12:20)
you probably just miss your stamp if (12:18 - 12:22)
you're like traveling but oh yeah (12:20 - 12:24)
probably I mean it's on your phone so it (12:22 - 12:26)
should read that you're in a new time (12:24 - 12:28)
zone yeah it'll update the time but it's (12:26 - 12:30)
it's hard to go to sleep at the same (12:28 - 12:33)
time consistently (12:30 - 12:33)
if I'm going to Japan and I'm using (12:34 - 12:40)
Pokemon sleep where am I where am I (12:36 - 12:42)
putting where am I putting the Pokemon (12:40 - 12:45)
plus am I putting it in like behind my (12:42 - 12:47)
head am I (12:45 - 12:50)
where is the place where does it have to (12:47 - 12:51)
be (12:50 - 12:54)
on the bed I know it has to be it has to (12:51 - 12:56)
be on the soft surface they said near (12:54 - 12:58)
your pillow they didn't say under your (12:56 - 13:00)
pillow oh okay okay I believe in the (12:58 - 13:02)
commercial they did not put it under (13:00 - 13:03)
their pillow they put it next to their (13:02 - 13:05)
pillow yeah but there's a lot of sleep (13:03 - 13:08)
trackers that you do put under your (13:05 - 13:09)
pillow (13:08 - 13:11)
yeah (13:09 - 13:13)
um uh speaking of the Pokeball go plus (13:11 - 13:15)
plus the Pokeball go plus plus device (13:13 - 13:17)
allows you to track your sleep while (13:15 - 13:20)
with the Press of a button after pairing (13:17 - 13:22)
your go plus plus to your sleep app it (13:20 - 13:24)
can be placed by your pillow to measure (13:22 - 13:26)
your sleep throughout the night not only (13:24 - 13:27)
that but there's also a night cap (13:26 - 13:30)
wearing Pikachu inside the go plus plus (13:27 - 13:32)
that you can meet in Pokemon sleep (13:30 - 13:35)
although you can normally build teams of (13:32 - 13:37)
five helpers from among the Pokemon (13:35 - 13:39)
you've met in sleep this level but (13:37 - 13:42)
Pikachu will fill in as the sixth team (13:39 - 13:46)
member pay to win pay to win if this was (13:42 - 13:48)
a competitive VTC Greg would have five (13:46 - 13:50)
Pokemon I would have six clearly I would (13:48 - 13:53)
win the battle did you excuse me I (13:50 - 13:56)
bought this dumb device unless unless (13:53 - 13:57)
you're shooting a game they really (13:56 - 13:59)
should have named it uh double plus good (13:57 - 14:03)
and really just leaned in (13:59 - 14:05)
unless you're talking about the anime (14:03 - 14:07)
episode where Ash is battling the (14:05 - 14:09)
Beyblade kid and the Beyblade kid (14:07 - 14:11)
forgets that it's he's supposed to bring (14:09 - 14:13)
a six Pokemon and then he doesn't and (14:11 - 14:16)
then his Riolu evolves into Lucario and (14:13 - 14:18)
he just crushes Ash and Ash gets (14:16 - 14:20)
eliminated from the tournament I can't (14:18 - 14:22)
remember what that kid's name is (14:20 - 14:26)
but what a battle (14:22 - 14:26)
uh Pikachu will let out a cry from the (14:27 - 14:31)
go plus plus device to let you know when (14:29 - 14:34)
you when uh the wake up time and bedtime (14:31 - 14:38)
chosen has arrived it will even sing you (14:34 - 14:42)
a lullaby uh uh when you begin tracking (14:38 - 14:44)
your sleep the longer you track your (14:42 - 14:45)
sleep using the go plus plus the (14:44 - 14:47)
friendlier the night cap wearing Pikachu (14:45 - 14:50)
will become towards you as it does it'll (14:47 - 14:52)
collect more berries and wake you up (14:50 - 14:54)
with different cries (14:52 - 14:56)
have they shown micro transactions yet (14:54 - 14:59)
is it better they have I I feel like (14:56 - 15:02)
they missed a lullaby Jigglypuff (14:59 - 15:05)
connection here I think hardcore no no I (15:02 - 15:07)
think Jigglypuff is when you don't sleep (15:05 - 15:08)
well I think they've talked about they (15:07 - 15:11)
talk about this in the in the video (15:08 - 15:13)
when when you don't sleep well (15:11 - 15:16)
Jigglypuff shows up to be like I think (15:13 - 15:18)
so buddy maybe I missed that I don't (15:16 - 15:19)
remember seeing it I think I think it (15:18 - 15:23)
was near the end of the video on the (15:19 - 15:27)
yeah yeah it uh hold on (15:23 - 15:27)
if you're having a noisy night it will (15:28 - 15:32)
consider you a Jigglypuff which is (15:30 - 15:34)
singing sleep (15:32 - 15:37)
that's what she says in the video (15:34 - 15:40)
okay because when you're using the app (15:37 - 15:42)
to track it instead of the go plus plus (15:40 - 15:46)
it does use the microphone (15:42 - 15:48)
on your phone yep (15:46 - 15:50)
the plus plus doesn't have a microphone (15:48 - 15:52)
so it doesn't track based on sound but (15:50 - 15:54)
when you track your sleep on your phone (15:52 - 15:57)
with this device it will record clips of (15:54 - 15:59)
sounds to tell you if you're snoring or (15:57 - 16:04)
not or anything like that I'm into this (15:59 - 16:04)
I can't wait for my my snoring to be um (16:04 - 16:12)
I sold to tick tock all right they need (16:07 - 16:14)
to start differentiating between human (16:12 - 16:18)
snoring and my dog snoring this things (16:14 - 16:19)
would be like I don't know what's (16:18 - 16:21)
happening in this house this is this is (16:19 - 16:24)
not a multi-person animal bed product (16:21 - 16:26)
it is not (16:24 - 16:29)
uh when you spin pokestop wait oh sorry (16:26 - 16:30)
sorry (16:29 - 16:32)
um collect berries wake you up with (16:30 - 16:34)
different cries uh you can even earn (16:32 - 16:36)
some Pokemon sleep bonuses by connecting (16:34 - 16:38)
Pokemon go plus plus to Pokemon go when (16:36 - 16:40)
you spin Pokemon stops with the Pokemon (16:38 - 16:42)
go (16:40 - 16:44)
uh in Pokemon go with the device it will (16:42 - 16:46)
record it and give you berries if you (16:44 - 16:48)
connect to Pokemon sleep Pokemon sleep (16:46 - 16:51)
Pokemon go plus plus will be released on (16:48 - 16:53)

don't matter like threads went up for (16:59 - 17:02)
pre-order and they're like it's coming (17:01 - 17:04)

like literally the dude who made the (17:11 - 17:16)
logo was like I can't wait for you guys (17:14 - 17:18)
to try this in two weeks and then he (17:16 - 17:22)
like tweeted just kidding two hours (17:18 - 17:22)
[Music] (17:23 - 17:28)
oh schedules yeah I don't understand why (17:25 - 17:30)
like like the pre-order thing like (17:28 - 17:33)
pre-black part of your phone off like (17:31 - 17:35)
they're not gonna run out of copies it's (17:33 - 17:37)
a digital thing (17:35 - 17:40)
that you do down (17:37 - 17:42)
so yeah while you're thinking about it (17:40 - 17:43)
you pre-download it while you're (17:42 - 17:45)
thinking about it and then if you forget (17:43 - 17:48)
about it you still download it (17:45 - 17:51)
they're gonna run out of Pokemon (17:48 - 17:53)
there's been a run on the Pokemon bank (17:51 - 17:57)
there's no sleep left (17:53 - 17:57)
anymore restock it we only have 15 (17:57 - 18:03)
people who could fall asleep the rest of (18:01 - 18:06)
you are staying up until we make more (18:03 - 18:08)
Hannah I missed this what is the micro (18:06 - 18:10)
transactions in this game and how much (18:08 - 18:11)
money can I give it I don't think it's (18:10 - 18:14)
been fully detailed I think it was the (18:11 - 18:15)
berries Joe is the one who talked the (18:14 - 18:17)
most about it and said that it didn't (18:15 - 18:20)
seem super money grabby didn't seem (18:17 - 18:23)
super pay to win (18:20 - 18:26)
I'm paying to win if there's anything (18:23 - 18:29)
asleep I mean well that's the question (18:26 - 18:33)
generally Pokemon is the collector's (18:29 - 18:35)
sorts of games like you want to get (18:33 - 18:38)
everything I'm not convinced this is a (18:35 - 18:41)
healthy game for collectors (18:38 - 18:41)
to get the super rare Jirachi that could (18:43 - 18:49)
only awaken somebody who's in a coma but (18:46 - 18:51)
if you're sleeping consistently and your (18:49 - 18:53)
your night's sleep is similar every (18:51 - 18:56)
night (18:53 - 18:57)
I think you're only going to be getting (18:56 - 18:59)
the same sorts of Pokemon every night (18:57 - 19:00)
and you're never going to be able to (18:59 - 19:03)
fill up your Pokedex I haven't seen any (19:00 - 19:05)
way that that's gonna work otherwise (19:03 - 19:07)
this is oh because it's riddled with (19:05 - 19:09)
problems also have they released who (19:07 - 19:12)
they're selling my information to (19:09 - 19:14)
not yet (19:12 - 19:17)
darn it (19:14 - 19:17)
um (19:17 - 19:22)
it it looks cool I uh I I don't know (19:18 - 19:24)
what to expect (19:22 - 19:24)
I I wanna I do want to give Joe props uh (19:24 - 19:30)
as as much as his website is still stuck (19:28 - 19:31)
in (19:30 - 19:34)
2002. uh I I think he did do probably (19:31 - 19:37)
one of the best jobs I think him in IGN (19:34 - 19:38)
probably did like the best jobs (19:37 - 19:40)
outlining it they they invited like (19:38 - 19:43)
other content creators and no shade to (19:40 - 19:45)
them but like posting a picture that you (19:43 - 19:47)
like played Pokemon sleep and like thank (19:45 - 19:49)
you for the invite like isn't the whole (19:47 - 19:53)
concept there's no information yeah you (19:49 - 19:55)
couldn't like (19:53 - 19:55)
the whole point of inviting other people (19:55 - 20:00)
is to like get their take on the app and (19:57 - 20:02)
like somebody might be like Oh I'm super (20:00 - 20:04)
like how like how did you sleep like (20:02 - 20:07)
what what what happened that's the whole (20:04 - 20:09)
point they invited you to sleep like did (20:07 - 20:11)
you get a Jigglypuff did you get like a (20:09 - 20:14)
Machop did you get a like (20:11 - 20:17)
did it record six hours did you wake up (20:14 - 20:19)
and pee did you wake up and I need to (20:17 - 20:21)
know if you went to the bathroom and (20:19 - 20:23)
what happened to the like maybe the (20:21 - 20:26)
maybe the NDA was like oh you can't talk (20:23 - 20:28)
about that but Joe talked about a lot (20:26 - 20:32)
I'm sure I'm sure they all signed it so (20:28 - 20:34)
this is the real thing this is the real (20:32 - 20:36)
test of friendship who are you gonna (20:34 - 20:38)
share your sleep data with because some (20:36 - 20:40)
of you do not get access to that I'm (20:38 - 20:43)
gonna tell you that right now (20:40 - 20:43)
and I will tell you how I sleep Steve's (20:48 - 20:53)
at the five dollar level I'm at the 20 (20:52 - 20:57)
Level I do feel like I should have some (20:53 - 20:59)
sort of accountability partner because (20:57 - 21:00)
that can be useful to get me to sleep (20:59 - 21:04)
more but I I don't know I have two (21:00 - 21:06)
accountability Partners they are my dogs (21:04 - 21:09)
and if we stay up too late Goblin gets (21:06 - 21:10)
so mad (21:09 - 21:13)
he will sit in the middle of the living (21:10 - 21:16)
room and just look at Brent and I and go (21:13 - 21:19)
and we're like buddy we're not tired (21:16 - 21:21)
okay I don't want to go lay up in the (21:19 - 21:22)
bed (21:21 - 21:24)
and not be tired up in the bed and he'll (21:22 - 21:26)
just sit there and stare until we're (21:24 - 21:31)
like fine we are going to bed (21:26 - 21:31)
is the microphone gonna pick up that my (21:31 - 21:37)
cat meows for like three hours straight (21:34 - 21:40)
before he's ready to go to sleep yep yep (21:37 - 21:43)
this is this is this is this is they're (21:40 - 21:45)
gonna sell this to big pet (21:43 - 21:47)
they're gonna sell this big marriage (21:45 - 21:50)
they're gonna sell it I'm okay with them (21:47 - 21:52)
sharing the data with Chewie I think (21:50 - 21:55)
Chewie is a very respectable company (21:52 - 21:58)
no they didn't hire me so they are on my (21:55 - 21:59)
list so they're on the they're on the (21:58 - 22:01)
back they're on the bad lists Archer (21:59 - 22:04)
Archer needs to uh bring every single (22:01 - 22:07)
toy from the downstairs upstairs and he (22:04 - 22:09)
meows the entire time of toys in his (22:07 - 22:11)
mouth and then he needs to proceed to (22:09 - 22:13)
bring it into the bed so I wake up with (22:11 - 22:16)
just all these cat toys that is amazing (22:13 - 22:18)
every morning (22:16 - 22:21)
he's he's very proud of his toy (22:18 - 22:22)
collection (22:21 - 22:24)
um (22:22 - 22:28)
it looks look I I I I think (22:24 - 22:31)
seeing the screenshots now it it does (22:28 - 22:33)
actually look (22:31 - 22:37)
not shallow (22:33 - 22:40)
um because it I mean they announced it (22:37 - 22:41)
and then they went silent for what like (22:40 - 22:44)
three years and then when they at least (22:41 - 22:46)
stopped going silent it still looked (22:44 - 22:50)
like a pretty shallow shell of a game (22:46 - 22:54)
um it it does also I mean like (22:50 - 22:56)
it's the same developer as Magikarp jump (22:54 - 22:59)
it it does give me big Magikarp jumps (22:56 - 23:00)
yeah (22:59 - 23:04)
yeah like maybe the Pokemon game maybe (23:00 - 23:06)
the Pokemon company was like (23:04 - 23:07)
hey we loved all those buttons in (23:06 - 23:11)
Magikarp jump just copy and paste (23:07 - 23:11)
this whole thing copying and pasting (23:12 - 23:18)
um there is okay the part where it (23:15 - 23:20)
interfaces with Pokemon go though and (23:18 - 23:22)
gives you rewards in Pokemon go because (23:20 - 23:24)
it sends your sleep data to Pokemon go (23:22 - 23:26)
finally Niantic has another selling (23:24 - 23:27)
point (23:26 - 23:30)
you can apparently get Stardust stickers (23:27 - 23:32)
and (23:30 - 23:35)
uh shoot something else (23:32 - 23:38)
at least Stardust and stickers (23:35 - 23:38)
I'm into the Stardust yeah depending on (23:39 - 23:44)
how much probably not very much but (23:42 - 23:47)
little bits a stardust (23:44 - 23:49)
uh speaking of Pokemon go uh we'll do (23:47 - 23:51)
the Pokemon go sleep integration here (23:49 - 23:53)
and then we'll take a break and then (23:51 - 23:54)
we'll do the rest of Pokemon go but uh (23:53 - 23:56)
this says celebrate the upcoming release (23:54 - 23:59)
of Pokemon go plus plus uh with catching (23:56 - 24:01)
some z's event (23:59 - 24:04)
on Saturday July 15th so again the (24:01 - 24:06)
Pokeball the Pokemon go plus plus comes (24:04 - 24:09)
out the 14th this event is on the 15th (24:06 - 24:11)
which makes me believe (24:09 - 24:13)
that we're gonna get sleep on Thursday (24:11 - 24:15)
or Friday (24:13 - 24:17)
although like time zones so who knows (24:15 - 24:20)
wait what does that look Greg (24:17 - 24:22)
I think I I think that's wishful (24:20 - 24:23)
thinking (24:22 - 24:24)
you think you don't think it's coming (24:23 - 24:27)
out this week no (24:24 - 24:27)
no (24:28 - 24:32)
definitely I'm gonna release the the (24:29 - 24:34)
item and you can connect it to Pokemon (24:32 - 24:36)
go and use it but I I think they may (24:34 - 24:39)
still hold off on sleep (24:36 - 24:39)
yeah the (24:40 - 24:44)
this event is only that weekend (24:42 - 24:47)
yeah and it's in go (24:44 - 24:49)
yep they want you they want you to buy (24:47 - 24:52)
it they not as Niantic the Pokemon (24:49 - 24:54)
company they just want their money they (24:52 - 24:56)
just but I mean Pokemon go plus like (24:54 - 24:59)
it's sold out like I don't think they're (24:56 - 25:01)
necessarily worried about you buying the (24:59 - 25:03)
go plus because that's true a million (25:01 - 25:04)
people already bought it and it's (25:03 - 25:05)
already gone (25:04 - 25:09)
it's very true it did sell out oh I saw (25:05 - 25:11)
pictures of some places I saw the (25:09 - 25:12)
pictures of the go plus plus it looks a (25:11 - 25:16)
lot thinner than yeah initially which is (25:12 - 25:18)
good but is it still like the size of my (25:16 - 25:19)
head (25:18 - 25:21)
it's not that (25:19 - 25:23)
huge it's yeah it's not that huge I (25:21 - 25:25)
don't know if (25:23 - 25:28)
if it magnetizes if there's a magnet in (25:25 - 25:30)
it but I still want the concept of like (25:28 - 25:33)
using the (25:30 - 25:36)
oh I don't think there's a magnet in it (25:33 - 25:38)
you can attach a wrist strap to it yeah (25:36 - 25:41)
I saw the wrist strap but oh God I'm not (25:38 - 25:44)
fantastic (25:41 - 25:44)
some bizarre Beyblade cosplay when I'm (25:44 - 25:50)
doing Pokemon go it's just not gonna (25:48 - 25:51)
happen but they make they make those (25:50 - 25:54)
like magnet pop sockets I'll this is (25:51 - 25:55)
this is too complicated for a podcast to (25:54 - 25:58)
explain uh come to my twitch stream I'll (25:55 - 25:59)
explain exactly why I wanted to (25:58 - 26:03)
magnetize the back of my phone (25:59 - 26:05)
anyways uh there's a new Pokemon go (26:03 - 26:08)
debut komala the doubt the drowsing (26:05 - 26:10)
Pokemon is making their debut in Pokemon (26:08 - 26:11)
go (26:10 - 26:14)
and a Snorlax wearing a night cap will (26:11 - 26:16)
also make its debut you can complete (26:14 - 26:18)
special research tasks to encounter it (26:16 - 26:20)
if you're lucky trainers you may (26:18 - 26:22)
encounter a shiny one (26:20 - 26:25)
uh using the go plus plus will let you (26:22 - 26:27)
play Pokemon go without staring at your (26:25 - 26:29)
phone we hey remember I talked to John (26:27 - 26:31)
Hankey one time and he was like I don't (26:29 - 26:33)
like people doing that but (26:31 - 26:37)
Mr Mr Pikachu said we don't care Mr John (26:33 - 26:39)
Henke we want to sell more plastic (26:37 - 26:40)
devices (26:39 - 26:43)
you can also use the auto thorough (26:40 - 26:45)
function you'll be able to automatically (26:43 - 26:47)
throw pokeballs at wild Pokemon while (26:45 - 26:49)
the Auto Spin functions automatically (26:47 - 26:51)
spins pokestops you will also get an (26:49 - 26:53)
adjustment setting to switch between (26:51 - 26:55)
great and Ultra Balls (26:53 - 26:59)
so this is the third official device (26:55 - 27:01)
that connects the Pokemon go the first (26:59 - 27:05)
one was the Pokemon go plus which was (27:01 - 27:06)
the little (27:05 - 27:08)
uh (27:06 - 27:10)
pin looking thing it looked like a pin (27:08 - 27:13)
at this point yeah it would it would (27:10 - 27:15)
vibrate and light up and then you would (27:13 - 27:17)
press the button and it would throw a (27:15 - 27:20)
Pokeball then they released the uh fifty (27:17 - 27:21)
dollar (27:20 - 27:23)
the first one was 35. (27:21 - 27:26)
second one was 50 and that was the (27:23 - 27:27)
Pokemon (27:26 - 27:30)
pokeball go Plus (27:27 - 27:32)
which maybe I'm saying that wrong which (27:30 - 27:34)
was with let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee (27:32 - 27:37)
that was the big Pokeball (27:34 - 27:39)
um that would that would automatically (27:37 - 27:43)
spin pokestops if a Pokemon was in it if (27:39 - 27:44)
you're like me and you bought it and you (27:43 - 27:46)
never took the Mew out of it because you (27:44 - 27:48)
forgot uh then the Mew has been Auto (27:46 - 27:50)
spinning stops forever (27:48 - 27:53)
uh that one also had functionality with (27:50 - 27:56)
both sword and shield and let's go (27:53 - 27:57)
Pikachu let's go Eevee so and let's go (27:56 - 27:59)
Pikachu let's go Eevee you could use it (27:57 - 28:01)
as a controller you could also walk a (27:59 - 28:04)
Pokemon if you put you know a Rhyhorn in (28:01 - 28:07)
it it would the lights would be brown if (28:04 - 28:09)
you put azashian in it because you could (28:07 - 28:10)
put a Pokemon from sword and shield into (28:09 - 28:13)
it it would light up blue if you walked (28:10 - 28:15)
with them you could sync it back and get (28:13 - 28:17)
rewards I believe in sword and shield it (28:15 - 28:19)
was only like rare candy but in let's go (28:17 - 28:21)
Pikachu let's go Eevee it was like (28:19 - 28:24)
berries rare candy other stuff that it (28:21 - 28:25)
would collect as you walked (28:24 - 28:28)
both of those devices you could only use (28:25 - 28:31)
pokeballs this is the (28:28 - 28:33)
first device that will let you use great (28:31 - 28:36)
balls and Ultra Balls (28:33 - 28:39)
and it says after you pair your go plus (28:36 - 28:41)
plus with the Pokemon go you will take (28:39 - 28:43)
on special research that leads you to (28:41 - 28:46)
encounter with Snorlax wearing a night (28:43 - 28:48)
cap (28:46 - 28:48)
um (28:49 - 28:52)
we don't know how else to get more (28:50 - 28:54)
Snorlax encounters I guess probably just (28:52 - 28:57)
spinning stops (28:54 - 29:00)
and then the event will feature (28:57 - 29:02)
Jigglypuff Abra drowsy Snorlax Mareep (29:00 - 29:05)
Teddy Ursa slack off and wulu (29:02 - 29:07)
some trainers if you're lucky will get (29:05 - 29:10)
Muna and komala (29:07 - 29:14)
all of those can be shiny except wulu (29:10 - 29:16)
and komala also the picture of Snorlax (29:14 - 29:18)
in the wild is not the one with the (29:16 - 29:20)
night cap (29:18 - 29:22)
for whatever that's worth (29:20 - 29:24)
but wulu is a big (29:22 - 29:26)
dick because Hulu was only around for a (29:24 - 29:28)
very short time back there was the (29:26 - 29:30)
gallery (29:28 - 29:32)
of it probably do it was one but more (29:30 - 29:35)
people were still playing Pokemon go it (29:32 - 29:37)
was before a lot of the controversies (29:35 - 29:39)
um and so Hulu was around for a short (29:37 - 29:40)
time but a lot of people either (29:39 - 29:42)
transferred it because it was already in (29:40 - 29:44)
their decks or just didn't keep them (29:42 - 29:46)
around for one reason or another because (29:44 - 29:48)
they weren't a very good Pokemon but (29:46 - 29:51)
then when a move update came and I think (29:48 - 29:53)
it was double kick I'm really bad at (29:51 - 29:54)
remembering move names (29:53 - 29:58)
um they updated doubles moves or will (29:54 - 30:00)
lose moves I think it was double and it (29:58 - 30:03)
suddenly became great in PvP but you (30:00 - 30:06)
could not get it anywhere (30:03 - 30:10)
and so this event a singular double (30:06 - 30:10)
it's great in PvP (30:10 - 30:15)
have recently been able to get it as a (30:13 - 30:17)
reward in PVP and people were super (30:15 - 30:19)
excited about that but being able to (30:17 - 30:21)
actually catch it in the wild this is (30:19 - 30:23)
the first time it's been around in a (30:21 - 30:24)
good long while (30:23 - 30:26)
and I'm excited they're including it I (30:24 - 30:29)
got Willow pajamas for Pokemon sleep and (30:26 - 30:31)
was sad when it wasn't the the key (30:29 - 30:33)
Pokemon when they were going for Snorlax (30:31 - 30:35)
instead so I'm glad that it's included (30:33 - 30:38)
in the Pokemon go sleep (30:35 - 30:41)
I mean Hulu makes a set more sense but (30:38 - 30:43)
like if you need to reach as many people (30:41 - 30:45)
as possible you yeah you've got to (30:43 - 30:48)
choose the Gen one (30:45 - 30:50)
ah Reggie eleki is coming from Five Star (30:48 - 30:53)
raids because (30:50 - 30:56)
yeah uh sure uh there will be new (30:53 - 30:59)
avatars for uh the game including a (30:56 - 31:03)
Snorlax pattern nightcap and then uh I (30:59 - 31:04)
swear there was already a Snorlax onesie (31:03 - 31:07)
but maybe there wasn't in the game (31:04 - 31:09)
there was like a Piplup onesie I know (31:07 - 31:11)
yeah there there were Kanto starters and (31:09 - 31:15)
there were Sinnoh starters and azorua so (31:11 - 31:17)
the Snorlax is new (31:15 - 31:20)
and Pikachu (31:17 - 31:25)
uh this event is two days three days two (31:20 - 31:27)
days (31:25 - 31:27)
um July 15th starting at 10 A.M to (31:27 - 31:33)
Sunday July 16th at 8 p.m very limited (31:30 - 31:35)
actually so (31:33 - 31:38)
uh is Snorlax wearing a night cap being (31:35 - 31:40)
shiny the new rare Pokemon in Pokemon go (31:38 - 31:44)
find out next week (31:40 - 31:44)
it feels kind of like the team leader (31:45 - 31:54)
Pokemon from the season of Heroes or you (31:49 - 31:56)
could get one from the research and you (31:54 - 31:58)
had the potential to get shiny (31:56 - 32:00)
but almost nobody was able to get that (31:58 - 32:04)
shiny this feels kind of like that (32:00 - 32:04)
pay to win how much is the (32:04 - 32:09)
the well how much is this Pokeball plus (32:07 - 32:11)
I ordered like three of them (32:09 - 32:13)
uh (32:11 - 32:15)
but I yeah we ordered them back in (32:13 - 32:18)
February I don't remember how how much (32:15 - 32:19)
this costs I got an email from Best Buy (32:18 - 32:21)
this morning being like just a reminder (32:20 - 32:25)
you ordered this I was like okay cool (32:21 - 32:25)
yeah from somewhere I no longer remember (32:26 - 32:30)
where (32:28 - 32:34)
I mean it is 55 on Amazon what I think (32:30 - 32:36)
it was the Nintendo store that I ordered (32:34 - 32:38)
it from I don't know I think it I think (32:36 - 32:39)
some people ordered from Nintendo story (32:38 - 32:41)
yeah Nintendo store was the first place (32:39 - 32:44)
that had it and then over the couple of (32:41 - 32:45)
weeks after that after it sold out on (32:44 - 32:47)
the Nintendo store real quick other (32:45 - 32:50)
stores started to stock it in for (32:47 - 32:53)
pre-order I mean if I get it I get it if (32:50 - 32:55)
I don't I don't like well I ordered (32:53 - 32:56)
three because I wanted pretty sure I (32:55 - 32:58)
ordered one (32:56 - 33:00)
pretty sure it's coming I don't know (32:58 - 33:02)
also I don't know when it's coming (33:00 - 33:04)
because notoriously these plate shipping (33:02 - 33:07)
is all so bad so like (33:04 - 33:09)
I may have said it may be released on (33:07 - 33:11)
the 14th and it could still be a couple (33:09 - 33:12)
of weeks before I actually get it in my (33:11 - 33:14)
hands which which store do you think is (33:12 - 33:18)
going to start shipping it like tomorrow (33:14 - 33:18)
there was somebody on Reddit that got (33:19 - 33:23)
one early and they were like oh it (33:21 - 33:25)
doesn't work with Pokemon go yet because (33:23 - 33:28)
Pokemon go never updated so hmm they (33:25 - 33:31)
can't really do anything with it but (33:28 - 33:32)
they posted pictures of it looked nice (33:31 - 33:34)
yeah that's where you were able to see (33:32 - 33:36)
kind of the size comparison yeah yeah (33:34 - 33:38)
but yeah if you get it early it doesn't (33:36 - 33:40)
really matter because the the app isn't (33:38 - 33:43)
updated yet (33:40 - 33:44)
um (33:43 - 33:47)
uh I don't know uh if I don't know what (33:44 - 33:50)
the NDA I have to sign when I get to New (33:47 - 33:53)
York is but uh I will I promise you (33:50 - 33:55)
listener (33:53 - 33:56)
I will have to probably go to the (33:55 - 33:57)
bathroom in the middle of the night and (33:56 - 34:00)
I will tell you I will tell you what (33:57 - 34:01)
happens (34:00 - 34:06)
in in your Pokemon sleep the whatever (34:01 - 34:09)
I will let you know assuming my flight (34:06 - 34:11)
isn't canceled all right we'll take a uh (34:09 - 34:12)
quick break (34:11 - 34:14)
and then when we come back we got some (34:12 - 34:16)
other news to go through so we will be (34:14 - 34:19)
right back and we are back from our (34:16 - 34:20)
break (34:19 - 34:24)
happy seventh anniversary Pokemon go (34:20 - 34:27)
to celebrate we're gonna lay off about (34:24 - 34:31)
200 employees yeah good job (34:27 - 34:35)
and then recap what we did for the year (34:31 - 34:37)
uh before we get to the employee stuff (34:35 - 34:40)
let's actually recap what they did in (34:37 - 34:41)
the last year (34:40 - 34:42)
um (34:41 - 34:45)
main choices they make choices okay so (34:42 - 34:50)
they launched Team Rocket Shadow raids (34:45 - 34:52)
which (34:50 - 34:52)
are fine (34:53 - 34:58)
they're I think I think the gem mechanic (34:55 - 35:00)
is cool I I think the like everything (34:58 - 35:02)
else is just you either like raids or (35:00 - 35:05)
you don't but I do think like the Panic (35:02 - 35:09)
is fine oh I I like it you need more (35:05 - 35:10)
than one person (35:09 - 35:12)
yeah but that's like the whole concept (35:10 - 35:16)
of raids is like getting people together (35:12 - 35:18)
now you have to have them to coordinate (35:16 - 35:21)
uh they did the the golden pokestops and (35:18 - 35:23)
give me gold coins (35:21 - 35:26)
which I would say is positive yeah that (35:23 - 35:28)
was cool that was it is exciting to see (35:26 - 35:31)
a golden blur when I was uh in Ohio (35:28 - 35:33)
I was like oh golden lure we're moving (35:31 - 35:35)
we're going to it (35:33 - 35:36)
nice (35:35 - 35:40)
yeah those are stacked for go Fest (35:36 - 35:44)
uh they did a powerful Primal reversions (35:40 - 35:47)
that's that's just Mega Pokemon I don't (35:44 - 35:49)
think that was that's not that exciting (35:47 - 35:52)
uh Pokemon sizes XX small to XX large (35:49 - 35:55)
probably my favorite change I I know (35:52 - 35:57)
plenty of people that do not care about (35:55 - 36:00)
this at all but I super super like it I (35:57 - 36:02)
think I think we're carrying more now (36:00 - 36:05)
that the uh they're not called contests (36:02 - 36:07)
uh (36:05 - 36:11)
the non-contest the showcases are out (36:07 - 36:11)
uh they did the Vivion postcard thing (36:11 - 36:16)
which (36:14 - 36:18)
out of all this list I don't really care (36:16 - 36:20)
about but I do think it's probably the (36:18 - 36:23)
coolest thing they did do it was like (36:20 - 36:25)
pretty ambitious and it was like a (36:23 - 36:27)
actual good way to use the postcard (36:25 - 36:29)
feature (36:27 - 36:29)
it was super well received that's for (36:30 - 36:34)
sure (36:33 - 36:36)
uh they released Ultra Beast uh which (36:34 - 36:39)
going back to the raid thing I I think (36:36 - 36:43)
there was something there but like (36:39 - 36:46)
it's just raids (36:43 - 36:48)
like they made real cool videos for them (36:46 - 36:49)
though that's true (36:48 - 36:52)
a lot of people died in the making of (36:49 - 36:54)
those videos (36:52 - 36:54)
uh they sent me some cool posters like (36:55 - 37:00)
leading up to that and I was they're (36:58 - 37:02)
really cool I never got them framed or (37:00 - 37:03)
anything (37:02 - 37:06)
um and then they did the daily Adventure (37:03 - 37:08)
incense which I forgot was within the (37:06 - 37:09)
last year but it was that that came like (37:08 - 37:11)
shortly after the first go Fest which (37:09 - 37:14)
again I think is is a positive change (37:11 - 37:16)
especially for people who play every day (37:14 - 37:19)
um like the 15 minute thing (37:16 - 37:23)
so I think overall (37:19 - 37:23)
that's a good amount of like new (37:23 - 37:27)
features they added to the game they (37:25 - 37:29)
forgot Zorua (37:27 - 37:32)
that's true I feel like those were big (37:29 - 37:34)
things (37:32 - 37:37)
yeah yeah they did give me gold but they (37:34 - 37:41)
didn't do Zorua and kekland yeah (37:37 - 37:44)
ah man I saw a kecleon at like 2 A.M the (37:41 - 37:45)
other day (37:44 - 37:47)
and I was already in bed my Pokemon (37:45 - 37:50)
sleep would have been very unhappy I got (37:47 - 37:52)
up I threw pants on I got on my one (37:50 - 37:54)
wheel because it was more than a 10 (37:52 - 37:57)
minute walk I zoomed over there and then (37:54 - 38:00)
a d-spawn oh no why would you do that at (37:57 - 38:03)
2 A.M I've been like well three or five (38:00 - 38:08)
I'm at three of five I need two more (38:03 - 38:11)
it's time to let that go it's 2 30 in (38:08 - 38:13)
the morning (38:11 - 38:13)
[Laughter] (38:16 - 38:21)
um in the in the happy anniversary (38:19 - 38:23)
graphic uh there is a hisuin Goodra (38:21 - 38:26)
there is sprigatido quax Leaf Way Coco (38:23 - 38:30)
there's not crummy there's deance (38:26 - 38:33)
which no one knows how to say that (38:30 - 38:35)
Pokemon's name right I believe it is (38:33 - 38:37)
naginatal that's how they say it in the (38:35 - 38:39)
anime at least (38:37 - 38:43)
I think Naga is also like some Latin or (38:39 - 38:47)
Hebrew or I don't know it it does there (38:43 - 38:48)
is something to the front of that (38:47 - 38:51)
Pokemon's name (38:48 - 38:53)
undoubtedly (38:51 - 38:58)
I mean Naga our serpents in a lot of (38:53 - 39:02)
things are half serpent beings (38:58 - 39:06)
that applies to this but I mean Gaga's (39:02 - 39:09)
using a lot of things yeah (39:06 - 39:09)
um (39:09 - 39:12)
now you know how to say it oh there's a (39:11 - 39:15)
hatana in here I just saw that yeah (39:12 - 39:17)
holding on to Golden go (39:15 - 39:20)
that's cute and as we know from previous (39:17 - 39:23)
year's images there is no guarantee all (39:20 - 39:25)
of these things will be absolutely added (39:23 - 39:28)
to Pokemon go (39:25 - 39:28)
there is no guarantee all of these (39:28 - 39:32)
things will ever get fully added to (39:30 - 39:35)
Pokemon go (39:32 - 39:38)
uh very correct (39:35 - 39:40)
um (39:38 - 39:42)
the images are really cool but I don't (39:40 - 39:44)
trust them they love their images but (39:42 - 39:47)
yeah the images are full of lies yeah (39:44 - 39:50)
okay I mean there's like what (39:47 - 39:53)
there's the blooper and all sorts of (39:50 - 39:56)
stuff in here (39:53 - 39:59)
maybe we're not getting all this (39:56 - 40:02)
um so uh showcases are here Hannah have (39:59 - 40:04)
you done a show I haven't seen any at (40:02 - 40:07)
all I haven't yeah there was a bug where (40:04 - 40:09)
some people just couldn't see them and I (40:07 - 40:11)
kind of feel like I was one of those (40:09 - 40:13)
people I didn't look very hard but I (40:11 - 40:15)
live in an area with a good number of (40:13 - 40:18)
pokestops and in the time they were (40:15 - 40:21)
running I did not see a single one so (40:18 - 40:23)
they aren't running anymore and they're (40:21 - 40:25)
going to be coming back I think tomorrow (40:23 - 40:28)
so the day before this podcast comes out (40:25 - 40:30)
so by the time this podcast comes out (40:28 - 40:32)
they should be around again but I (40:30 - 40:34)
haven't gotten the chance to do one got (40:32 - 40:36)
it (40:34 - 40:37)
um if you don't know what a showcase is (40:36 - 40:38)
good thing you're listening to this (40:37 - 40:41)
podcast (40:38 - 40:41)
crazy that you said that it was bugged (40:41 - 40:44)
and some people can see it that this is (40:42 - 40:46)
that must be the first bug this game has (40:44 - 40:49)
ever had oh yeah really it is (40:46 - 40:51)
uh through throughout all your (40:49 - 40:53)
adventures and travels you have probably (40:51 - 40:55)
quite a few Pokemon that are (40:53 - 40:57)
particularly special maybe it's a (40:55 - 40:59)
massive Snorlax or an itty-bitty moral (40:57 - 41:01)
if you wanted to show off this extra (40:59 - 41:03)
special favorites now you can we're (41:01 - 41:05)
excited to announce pokestop showcases (41:03 - 41:07)
this new type of competition trainers (41:05 - 41:09)
will be able to enter Pokemon into (41:07 - 41:11)
showcases at select stops and have them (41:09 - 41:14)
compete against trainers other trainers (41:11 - 41:16)
Pokemon only a limited selection of (41:14 - 41:17)
Pokemon will be able to participate in a (41:16 - 41:20)
showcase these eligible Pokemon are (41:17 - 41:23)
chosen chosen from Pokemon's featured uh (41:20 - 41:26)
in the current go event so I think it (41:23 - 41:29)
was Squirtle when it first launched (41:26 - 41:30)
um (41:29 - 41:32)
showcases will run for a short time once (41:30 - 41:34)
the Showcase is over trainers will get (41:32 - 41:36)
rewards on their Pokemon Rank and (41:34 - 41:38)
trainers will take home a number one (41:36 - 41:40)
spot medal (41:38 - 41:41)
I don't know is that metal where's that (41:40 - 41:44)
metal going is it going on your Pokemon (41:41 - 41:47)
I don't actually know it doesn't say (41:44 - 41:48)
here (41:47 - 41:50)
uh pokestops hosting a showcase will (41:48 - 41:53)
have a unique icon above them prior to (41:50 - 41:55)
entering the Pokemon showcase the icon (41:53 - 41:57)
above will be green when you tap the (41:55 - 41:59)
pokestop you can then tap showcase enter (41:57 - 42:01)
a Pokemon once a Pokemon is entered the (41:59 - 42:04)
Showcase the icon will turn purple you (42:01 - 42:06)
can only enter one Pokemon at a pokestop (42:04 - 42:08)
that you are physically near showcases (42:06 - 42:10)
will take place at the same pokestops (42:08 - 42:12)
throughout a season so make sure to (42:10 - 42:14)
visit that pokestop regularly entering a (42:12 - 42:16)
Pokemon on your showcase does not leave (42:14 - 42:18)
them at the pokestop trainers will still (42:16 - 42:20)
be able to trade transfer change form or (42:18 - 42:22)
evolve their Pokemon after entering them (42:20 - 42:25)
into a showcase each Pokemon showcase (42:22 - 42:27)
can support up to 50 Pokemon an (42:25 - 42:30)
individual Pokemon can be entered into a (42:27 - 42:33)
choke only an individual Pokemon can be (42:30 - 42:37)
only entered into a showcase one time (42:33 - 42:37)
um (42:38 - 42:42)
what is it judging (42:39 - 42:44)
it's judging how big or small they are (42:42 - 42:48)
basically compared to the others (42:44 - 42:50)
yeah yeah so when you catch like an (42:48 - 42:52)
extra extra small it'll be like it's (42:50 - 42:56)
it'll like have like a ruler (42:52 - 42:56)
Squirtle so biggest Squirtle wins I (43:04 - 43:08)
think (43:07 - 43:11)
so yeah do we know that it's is it gonna (43:08 - 43:14)
is it biggest or smallest or is it just (43:11 - 43:15)
biggest (43:14 - 43:17)
it depends on the Showcase (43:15 - 43:20)
so sometimes there's definitely going to (43:17 - 43:22)
be smallest Pokemon wins I'm pretty (43:20 - 43:24)
certain of that but in this case for the (43:22 - 43:26)
Squirtle showcase for this event it's (43:24 - 43:30)
the biggest Squirtle wins (43:26 - 43:31)
uh you can (43:30 - 43:33)
you can (43:31 - 43:36)
catch a mouthful you can catch showcase (43:33 - 43:38)
eligible Pokemon throughout the duration (43:36 - 43:41)
of the Showcase period trainers can also (43:38 - 43:43)
switch out the Pokemon they enter in the (43:41 - 43:45)
Showcase Pokemon entered in a showcase (43:43 - 43:48)
can be switched out remotely (43:45 - 43:50)
so if you found an even bigger Squirtle (43:48 - 43:52)
is my understanding you can remote (43:50 - 43:54)
switch that one in (43:52 - 43:58)
you also I was hearing don't have to be (43:54 - 44:00)
particularly close to the pokestop you (43:58 - 44:01)
have to be (44:00 - 44:03)
able to see the pokestop but you don't (44:01 - 44:05)
have to be in Range close enough to spin (44:03 - 44:07)
it to be able to enter the Showcase you (44:05 - 44:09)
can be farther away than that it doesn't (44:07 - 44:11)
say here but I also read that you can (44:09 - 44:14)
only be in three showcases yeah at a (44:11 - 44:16)
time which is good (44:14 - 44:20)
because the Showcase caps at 50. (44:16 - 44:23)
so once it hits 50 people you can no (44:20 - 44:25)
longer enter it (44:23 - 44:26)
um (44:25 - 44:29)
and then you can claim your rewards I (44:26 - 44:32)
saw on the self road that the rewards (44:29 - 44:33)
were good and people were really excited (44:32 - 44:35)
about the rewards who knows if that's (44:33 - 44:38)
going to change in the future we all (44:35 - 44:42)
know that you're a seven week adventure (44:38 - 44:43)
stamp or whatever you used to give (44:42 - 44:45)
legendary Pokemon it hasn't given (44:43 - 44:47)
legendary Pokemon in like five years a (44:45 - 44:50)
long time but boy people will not the (44:47 - 44:51)
same people who are like bring back (44:50 - 44:53)
legendary Pokemon are the same people (44:51 - 44:54)
that are like bring back the footsteps (44:53 - 44:56)
like (44:54 - 44:57)
like this gave us (44:56 - 44:59)
game is sold that (44:57 - 45:03)
that long sailed that wasn't yesterday (44:59 - 45:06)
that wasn't last week that wasn't last (45:03 - 45:10)
year that was seven years ago (45:06 - 45:10)
that are not coming back they were fun (45:11 - 45:15)
though (45:14 - 45:18)
they were fun (45:15 - 45:18)
um (45:18 - 45:22)
hey I think this might be the first time (45:19 - 45:26)
on this podcast we can confidently say (45:22 - 45:29)
if you live in the middle of nowhere and (45:26 - 45:32)
your pokestop is a showcase (45:29 - 45:36)
you have a very distinct advantage (45:32 - 45:38)
you might have the best Advantage (45:36 - 45:40)
actually (45:38 - 45:43)
you might have if they have access to (45:40 - 45:46)
the Showcase if (45:43 - 45:51)
you might have no competition the one (45:46 - 45:53)
stop that's the bar down the street (45:51 - 45:55)
finally turns into a showcase check that (45:53 - 45:58)
thing every day (45:55 - 46:01)
you might be the only Squirtle in that (45:58 - 46:02)
showcase (46:01 - 46:04)
I wonder (46:02 - 46:06)
if they've (46:04 - 46:08)
counted for that right like I wonder if (46:06 - 46:10)
they're if the system does be like there (46:08 - 46:12)
has to be x amount (46:10 - 46:14)
entered in before it will actually pay (46:12 - 46:17)
out rewards have we seen no it's timed (46:14 - 46:20)
so they all end at a certain time right (46:17 - 46:21)
there don't have to be a certain number (46:20 - 46:24)
of Pokemon enters but I am do we know if (46:21 - 46:26)
they're since it's the top three if if (46:24 - 46:28)
it will still reward if there aren't (46:26 - 46:30)
three oh Greg is saying like if there's (46:28 - 46:31)
two Pokemon in and it's like you're all (46:30 - 46:33)
disqualified because there wasn't three (46:31 - 46:35)
of you there wasn't three which is (46:33 - 46:37)
something you can be the only one you (46:35 - 46:39)
can be the only one in there and win I (46:37 - 46:41)
am a little bit worried though about how (46:39 - 46:43)
they are saying that the Pokemon stops (46:41 - 46:46)
like if a pokestop is a showcase it will (46:43 - 46:48)
be the that pokestop will stay a (46:46 - 46:50)
showcase (46:48 - 46:52)
going forward (46:50 - 46:54)
um and just if they haven't been very (46:52 - 46:56)
careful about making sure that more (46:54 - 46:59)
rural places actually do have those (46:56 - 47:02)
then that kind of sucks I was really (46:59 - 47:04)
kind of expecting these to rotate and (47:02 - 47:07)
different pokestops would have different (47:04 - 47:11)
showcases but I'm assuming if my my (47:07 - 47:14)
guess would be that because things are (47:11 - 47:16)
categorized (47:14 - 47:18)
internally because of Ingress and their (47:16 - 47:20)
other games that showcases are more (47:18 - 47:23)
likely to appear at like a park (47:20 - 47:26)
and not like (47:23 - 47:26)
what the Poke like (47:27 - 47:32)
at the cemetery (47:30 - 47:38)
although cemeteries yeah I mean kinda (47:32 - 47:38)
uh (47:40 - 47:43)
I think this is really cool uh I would (47:44 - 47:50)
have loved to been able to experience it (47:48 - 47:53)
before they they took it away but (47:50 - 47:56)
it'll be back tomorrow yeah it'll be (47:53 - 47:58)
it'll be back so I'm excited I I'm (47:56 - 48:01)
excited to put my big or small Squirtle (47:58 - 48:03)
in whatever maybe maybe tomorrow when it (48:01 - 48:05)
launches it'll be the smallest Squirtle (48:03 - 48:07)
or something I think it's medium cool (48:05 - 48:10)
I'm excited to see how they may improve (48:07 - 48:13)
it and I am trying to decide whether I (48:10 - 48:15)
want to start hoarding my biggest and (48:13 - 48:18)
smallest Pokemon in Pokemon go just so (48:15 - 48:20)
that I can try and win every single (48:18 - 48:22)
showcase that ever happens (48:20 - 48:26)
well apparently there was a bug in (48:22 - 48:28)
scarlet and violet which is crazy for (48:26 - 48:30)
that game too it's wet so it's been so (48:28 - 48:33)
flaw-free I mean we're shocked that you (48:30 - 48:35)
said there's a bug in that game I cannot (48:33 - 48:36)
if you moved (48:35 - 48:39)
so uh (48:36 - 48:40)
there was a bug where if you moved over (48:39 - 48:43)
an XXL or an XX small Pokemon for (48:40 - 48:45)
Pokemon go it wouldn't give you the (48:43 - 48:49)
ribbon in or the Mark or Ribbon I think (48:45 - 48:50)
it's a ribbon I wouldn't give you the (48:49 - 48:52)
ribbon in Scarlet Violet but now that's (48:50 - 48:55)
fixed so you could safely move it like (48:52 - 48:56)
if you got like a (48:55 - 48:58)
extra extra small ursuluna from (48:56 - 49:00)
Community Day you could move it over and (48:58 - 49:02)
it should get the ribbon from the big (49:00 - 49:04)
and small lady so that that was fixed (49:02 - 49:06)
I think with the last (49:04 - 49:10)
something updated I don't know I don't (49:06 - 49:11)
know if that was a Pokemon home I think (49:10 - 49:13)
it was a Pokemon home specific issue (49:11 - 49:17)
that would re resize it and then you (49:13 - 49:19)
could move it in so (49:17 - 49:23)
that was a good minor change (49:19 - 49:23)
um (49:24 - 49:28)
I I guess like the the final bit of news (49:25 - 49:30)
here (49:28 - 49:34)
is uh Niantic let go of 200 plus (49:30 - 49:37)
employees I don't know if there's a lot (49:34 - 49:40)
to say that hasn't already been said in (49:37 - 49:44)
the last week it's super unfortunate (49:40 - 49:45)
um that people lost their jobs of course (49:44 - 49:47)
uh (49:45 - 49:48)
you know the first time there was (49:47 - 49:50)
layoffs which I think was like exactly (49:48 - 49:53)
like two years ago (49:50 - 49:54)
um there was one person I was working (49:53 - 49:57)
with on the Pokemon go team that (49:54 - 49:58)
that left I think that was the only (49:57 - 50:00)
person (49:58 - 50:01)
um I actually don't know if that was (50:00 - 50:04)
layoff related or just timing related uh (50:01 - 50:07)
but (50:04 - 50:07)
I mean Niantic has multiple games right (50:07 - 50:11)
they they have they had a lot of games (50:09 - 50:13)
uh (50:11 - 50:16)
yeah um so I don't know how many of (50:13 - 50:18)
those people were from the Pokemon go (50:16 - 50:21)
team but uh but we know that some were (50:18 - 50:23)
we know that some were because of I mean (50:21 - 50:27)
Twitter it was a hefty I mean 25 of (50:23 - 50:30)
their workforces I think it was 30. yeah (50:27 - 50:33)
I mean I'm saying 25 between 25 and 30 (50:30 - 50:36)
is a hefty amount of people to cut and (50:33 - 50:38)
they would have been cut across (50:36 - 50:42)
there would be a cut across a wide birth (50:38 - 50:45)
of functions so they could not get sued (50:42 - 50:49)
for targeted layoffs (50:45 - 50:49)
uh yes I I have learned about this (50:51 - 50:56)
recently uh that if you (50:53 - 50:59)
lay off more people than you need to (50:56 - 51:02)
then you can't say like well (50:59 - 51:04)
you know this person was in a wheelchair (51:02 - 51:07)
right or this is a person of color (51:04 - 51:07)
um as long as they have enough filling (51:08 - 51:13)
in that they could make a case that it (51:11 - 51:15)
was fair in court that's all they care (51:13 - 51:18)
about so when they do massive layoffs (51:15 - 51:20)
they will take out (51:18 - 51:23)
a ton of people especially people who (51:20 - 51:25)
may have just gotten there so it doesn't (51:23 - 51:27)
look like they're firing people for a (51:25 - 51:28)
tenure or because they earn too much (51:27 - 51:32)
money so it's super unfortunate when all (51:28 - 51:34)
of these things happen (51:32 - 51:37)
it is (51:34 - 51:37)
it is a overall bad thing for companies (51:38 - 51:46)
to do it does not mean like I want to (51:42 - 51:47)
point out that this does not mean that (51:46 - 51:51)
the company is doing poorly it does mean (51:47 - 51:56)
that generally investors or the board or (51:51 - 51:58)
stockholders wanted to see a drastic (51:56 - 52:02)
change in their bottom line and the (51:58 - 52:04)
fastest way for companies to do that is (52:02 - 52:06)
to cut things (52:04 - 52:10)
and staff so these things are (52:06 - 52:12)
particularly (52:10 - 52:16)
Troublesome the scrapping of (52:12 - 52:19)
the games mean that the really they were (52:16 - 52:20)
I mean he has come out and said they (52:19 - 52:22)
were having they overextended their (52:20 - 52:25)
money so like scrapping the big name (52:22 - 52:26)
licensing things where they would have (52:25 - 52:29)
to pay a lot of money to specific group (52:26 - 52:31)
makes a lot of sense yeah I have it (52:29 - 52:33)
right here uh specifically we are (52:31 - 52:35)
closing our this off niantic's website (52:33 - 52:37)
specifically this means we are closing (52:35 - 52:40)
our La Studio reducing our game flat (52:37 - 52:41)
platform team and making additional (52:40 - 52:44)
reductions across the company as a (52:41 - 52:46)
result we are sunsetting NBA all world (52:44 - 52:48)
that launched in January of this year (52:46 - 52:51)
and we are stopping production of Marvel (52:48 - 52:53)
World of Heroes which was I believe in (52:51 - 52:57)
beta this means we are laying off 230 (52:53 - 52:59)
Niantic employees (52:57 - 53:00)
I (52:59 - 53:03)
I would assume and I think a lot of (53:00 - 53:05)
people would safely assume most of the (53:03 - 53:08)
layoffs were from these two teams if you (53:05 - 53:09)
if you don't know how this works the (53:08 - 53:12)
there there is a dedicated Niantic team (53:09 - 53:14)
for Pikmin there is a dedicated Niantic (53:12 - 53:16)
team for Pokemon go the same for Peridot (53:14 - 53:19)
the same for Ingress it's not like I've (53:16 - 53:21)
seen this on the Internet it's not like (53:19 - 53:24)
Paradox launched so like five people (53:21 - 53:26)
that were working on Mega Evolution are (53:24 - 53:28)
suddenly making Peridot I like that's (53:26 - 53:30)
not how it works they're like completely (53:28 - 53:35)
separate teams yes and Ingress did (53:30 - 53:37)
release a separate post on their News (53:35 - 53:39)
website saying that the Ingress team was (53:37 - 53:41)
largely located at their Ally Studio (53:39 - 53:44)
yeah so these cut a bunch of or at least (53:41 - 53:46)
impacted a bunch of the Ingress team too (53:44 - 53:49)
which wasn't mentioned in the ninetic (53:46 - 53:51)
letter (53:49 - 53:51)
the way that this was done did not gain (53:52 - 53:56)
any respect I mean it wouldn't but it (53:54 - 53:59)
was done I don't know anyone any company (53:56 - 54:02)
laying off people no yes there's not (53:59 - 54:04)
really a way for it to be respectable (54:02 - 54:06)
but this was particularly (54:04 - 54:08)
bad the employees didn't know until (54:06 - 54:11)
everybody until everybody did yeah I (54:08 - 54:12)
mean that's what happened with my job I (54:11 - 54:14)
like walked in and everyone was like (54:12 - 54:16)
gathered or because I was always like (54:14 - 54:18)
the last person in because I I was like (54:16 - 54:21)
keeping the website open like running so (54:18 - 54:23)
I'd be up late like updating the website (54:21 - 54:25)
I walked in and everyone's like around (54:23 - 54:28)
like the little like couch seating area (54:25 - 54:30)
and they're like okay today's everyone's (54:28 - 54:34)
last day like what yeah (54:30 - 54:37)
they literally were like you can (54:34 - 54:40)
continue working the rest of the day or (54:37 - 54:42)
you can leave we won't be upset if you (54:40 - 54:45)
just left I can't stop you like you just (54:42 - 54:49)
fired me there's no there's no hanging (54:45 - 54:51)
around you'll still get paid if you (54:49 - 54:54)
leave I I would have walked out honestly (54:51 - 54:56)
because I was like well that's all right (54:54 - 54:58)
but I literally needed to pack my office (54:56 - 55:01)
so yeah like I had my own office so I (54:58 - 55:06)
was like well uh I I I get I guess I'll (55:01 - 55:07)
I'll like (55:06 - 55:10)
transfer some data and then I'll pack my (55:07 - 55:13)
Funko Pops (55:10 - 55:16)
yep I mean this (55:13 - 55:19)
I've seen a lot of people take really (55:16 - 55:21)
negative (55:19 - 55:25)
takes about the reason why these people (55:21 - 55:27)
got laid off is because of all the poor (55:25 - 55:31)
decisions that go has made and I can (55:27 - 55:33)
agree that yes Niantic has made some (55:31 - 55:35)
poor decisions (55:33 - 55:39)
I don't think those poor decisions (55:35 - 55:41)
around go (55:39 - 55:44)
were the driving factor I think it's (55:41 - 55:47)
much more he attempted to grow the (55:44 - 55:51)
company way faster than the market or (55:47 - 55:52)
their financials would allow (55:51 - 55:55)
particularly quickly branching out into (55:52 - 55:58)
other licensed games without sort of (55:55 - 56:02)
understanding how expensive that (55:58 - 56:04)
ultimately would be and understanding (56:02 - 56:07)
what made Pokemon go popular like and it (56:04 - 56:10)
is it's tough to catch lightning in a (56:07 - 56:12)
bottle again right like they are trying (56:10 - 56:15)
to get another summer of how great go (56:12 - 56:17)
felt seven years ago (56:15 - 56:21)
and they're they're trying and (56:17 - 56:24)
it you can look at Niantic and say you (56:21 - 56:27)
do need to get your bottom line together (56:24 - 56:30)
and the way you handled this is poor (56:27 - 56:35)
I will agree 100 with that layoffs are (56:30 - 56:37)
always a huge negative for any company (56:35 - 56:41)
and anybody who anybody who sees a job (56:37 - 56:42)
come up at Niantic you need to think (56:41 - 56:45)
really really really hard about (56:42 - 56:48)
taking that job because they are in a (56:45 - 56:51)
very unstable place (56:48 - 56:51)
but I think a lot of people who are out (56:52 - 56:57)
there saying this is directly because of (56:55 - 57:00)
go and you have remote access is what (56:57 - 57:01)
I've been saying like if they didn't (57:00 - 57:03)
change the remote rate passes wouldn't (57:01 - 57:05)
happen and to those people you you you (57:03 - 57:07)
have no clue yeah you're not looking at (57:05 - 57:09)
the bigger picture yeah that's that is (57:07 - 57:12)
there are bigger issues than the fact (57:09 - 57:14)
that they decided to limit raid passes (57:12 - 57:16)
right like there are bigger issues (57:14 - 57:19)
within the running of that company and I (57:16 - 57:21)
I do agree on some level like they (57:19 - 57:23)
really need to (57:21 - 57:26)
refocus on (57:23 - 57:31)
what works going forward but I I do (57:26 - 57:35)
think the bigger issue as outlined in (57:31 - 57:38)
their letter is they (57:35 - 57:42)
projected growth and then acted on that (57:38 - 57:45)
growth before that growth was real (57:42 - 57:48)
and that's a very common mistake a ton (57:45 - 57:51)
of businesses do (57:48 - 57:54)
uh yeah the other thing they say here is (57:51 - 57:56)
um (57:54 - 57:59)
our top priority is to keep Pokemon go (57:56 - 58:00)
healthy and growing as a forever game (57:59 - 58:02)
this is not a new statement they have (58:00 - 58:05)
said this tons of time before that they (58:02 - 58:07)
they want to see Pokemon to be 10 plus (58:05 - 58:08)
years (58:07 - 58:09)
happy birthday you've made it to year (58:08 - 58:11)
seven (58:09 - 58:14)
um they also say we will focus on making (58:11 - 58:17)
our recently launched games a success in (58:14 - 58:19)
terms of retention revenue and (58:17 - 58:23)
profitability I I being Mr Jim Henke I'm (58:19 - 58:25)
confident about the prospects for Pikmin (58:23 - 58:28)
Bloom peridot and Monster Hunter now but (58:25 - 58:30)
we have a lot of work to do (58:28 - 58:34)
so what is really funny is (58:30 - 58:37)
the day they announced this they also (58:34 - 58:41)
announced their like lead up to Pikmin 4 (58:37 - 58:45)
event in Pikmin and one of those uh (58:41 - 58:47)
things in Pikmin for those that don't (58:45 - 58:49)
play Pikmin they have like medals the (58:47 - 58:52)
same thing as like Pokemon go and they (58:49 - 58:53)
have limited time medals so there was (58:52 - 58:56)
like uh there was an event where (58:53 - 58:59)
the medals you could get were no longer (58:56 - 59:00)
available and they brought those back (58:59 - 59:03)
and in order to get it you have to spend (59:00 - 59:06)
700 coins which is seven dollars for a (59:03 - 59:07)
single metal it comes with a questline (59:06 - 59:08)
and stuff (59:07 - 59:11)
which is not that remember we all paid (59:08 - 59:13)
seven dollars for one that we all some (59:11 - 59:15)
of us foolishly played Seven dollars for (59:13 - 59:17)
Mr mime which is a singular Pokemon but (59:15 - 59:19)
you get a quest line and stuff the (59:17 - 59:21)
difference I think in Pikmin is it's (59:19 - 59:23)
really easy to get coins you can get 60 (59:21 - 59:25)
coins a day just by like walking it's (59:23 - 59:27)
super easy so honestly like a week of (59:25 - 59:29)
playing Pikmin you can get this medal (59:27 - 59:30)
for free ultimately (59:29 - 59:32)
um today is my for today I will be able (59:30 - 59:34)
to buy my food medal by the way (59:32 - 59:38)
um but I almost gave Pikmin money I was (59:34 - 59:40)
like oh like it's a big celebration like (59:38 - 59:42)
there's more that they added than just (59:40 - 59:43)
like the metals right like they added a (59:42 - 59:45)
bunch of other stuff costumes and stuff (59:43 - 59:46)
and I was gonna like maybe I'll give (59:45 - 59:49)
like I've only in the three two years (59:46 - 59:50)
I've played Pikmin I've given it twenty (59:49 - 59:51)
dollars (59:50 - 59:53)
and I was like maybe I'll give it twenty (59:51 - 59:54)
dollars because I really really like it (59:53 - 59:56)
and Pikmin 4 is coming out and that's (59:54 - 59:57)
like really cool I'm really excited for (59:56 - 59:59)
Pikmin 4. and then this blog post came (59:57 - 60:01)
out and they said like Pikmin Bloom is (59:59 - 60:04)
safe and I'm like is it only safe (60:01 - 60:07)
because literally Pikmin 4 is two weeks (60:04 - 60:10)
away like that would be um that would be (60:07 - 60:12)
like the craziest thing ever to shut (60:10 - 60:16)
down Pikmin right before Pikmin 4 comes (60:12 - 60:18)
out so like even though they're like ah (60:16 - 60:20)
Pikmin safe and (60:18 - 60:23)
I I do I do think like pigmented (60:20 - 60:26)
probably is doing better than and like I (60:23 - 60:28)
don't know a lot of basketball people (60:26 - 60:31)
but the basketball people I do know did (60:28 - 60:34)
not care about NBA Live yeah the the (60:31 - 60:36)
club that I ran in college that was a (60:34 - 60:39)
Pokemon go Club the person who was the (60:36 - 60:41)
president of that club for the most (60:39 - 60:44)
recent years is a big basketball fan and (60:41 - 60:47)
ran a Pokemon go club and wasn't into (60:44 - 60:49)
this game yeah I I think that that one I (60:47 - 60:53)
think everybody who saw literally did a (60:49 - 60:56)
what how is that supposed to work is it (60:53 - 60:58)
a Space Jam thing I could maybe see if (60:56 - 61:00)
it was a Space Jam it was a Space Jam (60:58 - 61:03)
thing I'd be in yes sign me up I have a (61:00 - 61:06)
feeling like Pikmin Bloom's fate relies (61:03 - 61:08)
on how well adoption is after excitement (61:06 - 61:14)
with Pikmin 4 happens right like yeah (61:08 - 61:14)
pikmin's also (61:14 - 61:18)
somewhat backed by well not someone it (61:16 - 61:20)
is backed by Nintendo right Nintendo (61:18 - 61:23)
knows games right like Mario Kart mobile (61:20 - 61:26)
is still a thing Animal Crossing is (61:23 - 61:28)
still a thing like (61:26 - 61:31)
I I would also I you know Pikmin is very (61:28 - 61:32)
big in Japan (61:31 - 61:36)
these games work Pokemon go (61:32 - 61:38)
Ingress Pikmin Bloom they work really (61:36 - 61:40)
well in Japan because a lot of people (61:38 - 61:42)
don't have cars there they commute they (61:40 - 61:43)
walk (61:42 - 61:45)
um (61:43 - 61:45)
I don't know how big basketball is in (61:46 - 61:51)
Japan you know what I mean like yeah (61:48 - 61:56)
like I I I I feel like (61:51 - 61:58)
we said this for Pokemon unite I still (61:56 - 62:00)
100 believe this for Pokemon unite (61:58 - 62:05)
Pokemon unite could have flopped (62:00 - 62:08)
like terrifically could have had the (62:05 - 62:10)
biggest flop in the world in the U.S it (62:08 - 62:13)
wouldn't have mattered because China (62:10 - 62:16)
loves mobile games and specifically they (62:13 - 62:18)
love MOBA games and this is a MOBA (62:16 - 62:22)
mobile game and like Pokemon unite could (62:18 - 62:24)
be dead in the water in the US but still (62:22 - 62:27)
be a huge success in China or pretty (62:24 - 62:29)
much all of Asia (62:27 - 62:32)
um I I think the same for Pikmin like (62:29 - 62:34)
yeah I think Pikmin Bloom could be (62:32 - 62:36)
terrible in the United States but like (62:34 - 62:39)
Asia loves it (62:36 - 62:42)
um so (62:39 - 62:44)
I still haven't given Pikmin Bloom 20 (62:42 - 62:47)
but I almost did until I read this book (62:44 - 62:48)
yeah (62:47 - 62:51)
also according to this one post I see on (62:48 - 62:54)
Japan basketball is still very much an (62:51 - 62:55)
up and coming (62:54 - 62:59)
sport in Japan baseball is popular oh (62:55 - 63:01)
yeah soccer of course because soccer is (62:59 - 63:05)
popular or everywhere but America (63:01 - 63:08)
uh hey my my nephews are (63:05 - 63:11)
are soccer stars so back off (63:08 - 63:13)
they're getting scholarships based off (63:11 - 63:15)
of their soccer skills so we're very (63:13 - 63:17)
happy now that you said the Ingress (63:15 - 63:21)
stuff earlier Hannah he says I'm excited (63:17 - 63:23)
for Pikmin Bloom Peridot Monster Hunter (63:21 - 63:25)
why why did he not why did he wasn't (63:23 - 63:27)
mentioned in this blog post (63:25 - 63:29)
which is wild (63:27 - 63:31)
considering it was it was the original (63:29 - 63:34)
game the way they started this company (63:31 - 63:37)
if you look at a lot of things that they (63:34 - 63:39)
talk about they never mentioned Ingress (63:37 - 63:42)
with the other stuff yeah it's like they (63:39 - 63:45)
consider Ingress its own (63:42 - 63:49)
company almost how weirdly they relegate (63:45 - 63:52)
Ingress to the side in its own (63:49 - 63:54)
communication like until it comes to (63:52 - 63:58)
layoffs yeah it's very weird how they (63:54 - 64:02)
treat Ingress versus these other games (63:58 - 64:04)
it's I know (64:02 - 64:07)
I don't want to say like they ignore (64:04 - 64:09)
them but they are definitely like oh (64:07 - 64:11)
they'll try to keep them separate those (64:09 - 64:13)
are the incarious people and these are (64:11 - 64:18)
the go Pikmin people which is such a (64:13 - 64:21)
weird it's just a weird division that (64:18 - 64:24)
they make because yeah he rarely talks (64:21 - 64:27)
about in any Pokemon Go stuff Ingress (64:24 - 64:30)
which has already been out for way (64:27 - 64:31)
longer than this (64:30 - 64:35)
I mean like you know go Fest like they (64:31 - 64:37)
had Ingress Fest before go Fest were (64:35 - 64:39)
even a thing like they've been doing (64:37 - 64:41)
that for (64:39 - 64:44)
Ingress Community thrived yeah for years (64:41 - 64:46)
before Pokemon go was even announced I (64:44 - 64:48)
played Ingress before Pokemon go was (64:46 - 64:51)
announced I did too (64:48 - 64:52)
um (64:51 - 64:55)
so I you know marvel didn't make it out (64:52 - 64:59)
NBA is gone Harry Potter's gone we still (64:55 - 65:01)
don't know it's kind of crazy to the sea (64:59 - 65:04)
to this day I I wish I could find like (65:01 - 65:06)
an ex-niantic employee if you're if (65:04 - 65:08)
you're an ex-niantic employee feel free (65:06 - 65:10)
to slide into my DMs uh we will (65:08 - 65:12)
anonymize you (65:10 - 65:15)
I am curious if (65:12 - 65:18)
Harry Potter was not because the game (65:15 - 65:21)
was like a complete failure I I actively (65:18 - 65:23)
saw people playing Harry Potter yeah (65:21 - 65:25)
like when we when Greg and I would do (65:23 - 65:26)
community days we would always see at (65:25 - 65:28)
least like two people like with Harry (65:26 - 65:31)
Potter open I have to this day I've (65:28 - 65:35)
never seen anyone with NBA Live open but (65:31 - 65:38)
I wonder if that was like a licensing (65:35 - 65:40)
thing like oh yeah like oh we don't want (65:38 - 65:43)
to pay JK Rowling WB game slash whatever (65:40 - 65:47)
it's just too much money for that like (65:43 - 65:49)
I'm sure they had a player base there's (65:47 - 65:51)
no doubt about that I mean the play race (65:49 - 65:54)
was upset when it closed but like yeah (65:51 - 65:56)
that could have just been like (65:54 - 65:59)
hey this licensing isn't working out and (65:56 - 66:02)
we can move our people to other teams (65:59 - 66:03)
and it's just like a win-win for both of (66:02 - 66:05)
us we're saving money not paying the (66:03 - 66:07)
licensing and we're saving like we're (66:05 - 66:10)
not getting that much money in return (66:07 - 66:11)
well one of the interesting things that (66:10 - 66:13)
I think keeps Ingress (66:11 - 66:16)
in the safe category is they don't pay (66:13 - 66:18)
anybody but themselves for English (66:16 - 66:20)
that's why they're keeping going with (66:18 - 66:24)
Peridot there's no licensing (66:20 - 66:27)
needed and that is just if they keep (66:24 - 66:28)
that game going they are making money (66:27 - 66:30)
and they get to keep it all in-house (66:28 - 66:33)
right like the the issue is of course (66:30 - 66:36)
this is their own IP it does not have (66:33 - 66:38)
the immediate population grab that a (66:36 - 66:41)
Pokemon or a Marvel or the NBA does but (66:38 - 66:44)
of course with those huge names comes (66:41 - 66:46)
huge licensing feeds you have to share (66:44 - 66:48)
you have to share what you're making (66:46 - 66:52)
so it's interesting like again it's (66:48 - 66:53)
interesting that they don't ever really (66:52 - 66:57)
talk about Ingress which is their own IP (66:53 - 67:00)
and they still relegate it to the (66:57 - 67:02)
Ingress community and those people are (67:00 - 67:06)
like lost forever like it's like what (67:02 - 67:08)
are you doing with them but like I don't (67:06 - 67:10)
think I I think I don't think Ingress (67:08 - 67:13)
will ever go anywhere mainly because it (67:10 - 67:16)
is still a very thriving (67:13 - 67:21)
base of players and it's their own IP (67:16 - 67:22)
yeah I (67:21 - 67:24)
as somebody who played Harry Potter for (67:22 - 67:25)
a solid week (67:24 - 67:28)
there was a lot of (67:25 - 67:31)
I don't want to say copying but it was (67:28 - 67:33)
really easy to compare Harry Potter to (67:31 - 67:36)
Pokemon go like here are the stops here (67:33 - 67:38)
are the gyms here's the walking here's (67:36 - 67:39)
the like (67:38 - 67:41)
instead of catching here's the spells (67:39 - 67:45)
like they did mimic a lot of stuff and (67:41 - 67:46)
there was some stuff that Harry Potter (67:45 - 67:48)
did better not a lot there are some (67:46 - 67:50)
there's obviously some stuff that (67:48 - 67:52)
Pokemon go did better but when I look at (67:50 - 67:56)
this these games Pikmin Peridot Monster (67:52 - 67:59)
Hunter Peridot is not remotely close to (67:56 - 68:03)
Pokemon I mean Peridot is a Tamagotchi (67:59 - 68:06)
like yeah and I (68:03 - 68:09)
I don't have the patience for Tamagotchi (68:06 - 68:11)
stuff like I know there are some people (68:09 - 68:13)
who do there are some people who like (68:11 - 68:14)
take care of like five different (68:13 - 68:17)
Tamagotchis a day and you know props to (68:14 - 68:20)
you I could barely keep myself alive I (68:17 - 68:23)
can't keep a digital pet alive so like (68:20 - 68:26)
that's that's cool like Peridot is a (68:23 - 68:28)
very different I don't even know if I (68:26 - 68:30)
would call it a game it is a Tamagotchi (68:28 - 68:32)
um and (68:30 - 68:33)
it's an expensive Tamagotchi like if you (68:32 - 68:35)
want another Peridot you have to spend (68:33 - 68:37)
like I think like six or seven dollars I (68:35 - 68:39)
think but just five but that is when I (68:37 - 68:41)
stopped playing but that that is like (68:39 - 68:44)
the tamagachi community like yeah like I (68:41 - 68:46)
I get people are frustrated that like oh (68:44 - 68:48)
in order to get another paradise but I (68:46 - 68:50)
have to spend five dollars like you know (68:48 - 68:52)
like you don't understand like people (68:50 - 68:54)
who are into Tamagotchis they are buying (68:52 - 68:57)
new Tamagotchis like weekly they are (68:54 - 68:59)
like it is a collecting slash like (68:57 - 69:01)
taking care of like I'm not trying to (68:59 - 69:04)
defend Niantic but like they're not off (69:01 - 69:05)
the (69:04 - 69:07)
they're not off base really far with (69:05 - 69:11)
Peridot like no it is what it is what (69:07 - 69:15)
they're replicating Pikmin Bloom is not (69:11 - 69:17)
anywhere near (69:15 - 69:19)
Pokemon go and that's why I think I like (69:17 - 69:21)
it so much like it is such a chill game (69:19 - 69:25)
you it runs in the background (69:21 - 69:27)
um like you you do your like you wake up (69:25 - 69:30)
you check your Pikmin return before you (69:27 - 69:32)
go to bed you send them out at night (69:30 - 69:36)
like it is exactly what I want in (69:32 - 69:39)
a mobile game that like I can't like (69:36 - 69:41)
people said this when Harry Potter came (69:39 - 69:44)
out it was impossible unless you unless (69:41 - 69:46)
you made this your full-time job to play (69:44 - 69:48)
both Pokemon and Harry Potter at the (69:46 - 69:52)
same time they were asking ways way too (69:48 - 69:53)
much (69:52 - 69:56)
I think for a lot of people they (69:53 - 69:58)
probably have maybe one two or three (69:56 - 70:02)
like full-time mobile games and Pikmin (69:58 - 70:05)
never feels like it's trying to fight (70:02 - 70:08)
for that right it's very light and it's (70:05 - 70:10)
not asking a lot (70:08 - 70:13)
and it's great uh I have no clue what (70:10 - 70:15)
monster hunter is going to ask of you (70:13 - 70:17)
I'm gonna assume it's pretty intense is (70:15 - 70:20)
closer to the Harry Potter Pokemon go it (70:17 - 70:23)
feels similar (70:20 - 70:25)
um also like (70:23 - 70:27)
his final paragraph of this letter is (70:25 - 70:29)
real bad the way he signed it off with (70:27 - 70:32)
lower case initials bothers me well the (70:29 - 70:34)
thing that bothers me and this is what (70:32 - 70:36)
all CEOs do (70:34 - 70:40)
yeah it's all just it's CEO it is sad to (70:36 - 70:43)
say goodbye (70:40 - 70:43)
no you're not so one of your thoughts (70:44 - 70:48)
man you needed somebody needed to say (70:46 - 70:52)
cut that because nobody wants to hear (70:48 - 70:56)
that you making a decision to fire (70:52 - 70:59)
230 people who will no longer have jobs (70:56 - 71:03)
whose feature are now completely unknown (70:59 - 71:06)
because of your actions that you're sad (71:03 - 71:09)
about that nobody wants to hear that (71:06 - 71:12)
from a CEO it is so fake and so false (71:09 - 71:14)
and that whole sentence would have been (71:12 - 71:16)
better if you had just cut that up (71:14 - 71:17)
because the rest that comes after that (71:16 - 71:21)
is like oh pity me it's so hard for me (71:17 - 71:23)
to make these decisions no it's not (71:21 - 71:25)
because you are safe (71:23 - 71:28)
you are making a ton of money and you (71:25 - 71:30)
will not be touched nowhere in this (71:28 - 71:32)
thing but is has anybody talking about (71:30 - 71:34)
how they're touching your salary your (71:32 - 71:36)
stock options or anything you're doing (71:34 - 71:39)
to save money for yourself (71:36 - 71:41)
it infuriates me when I get to the end (71:39 - 71:42)
of these things because they're always (71:41 - 71:44)
like oh it was so hard to do this and (71:42 - 71:47)
it's so painful for you to go it was not (71:44 - 71:49)
painful for you at all you are still (71:47 - 71:51)
getting paid (71:49 - 71:54)
millions of dollars (71:51 - 71:58)
yacht if you get replaced you absolutely (71:54 - 72:00)
have a golden parachute meaning you will (71:58 - 72:02)
never have to work again for the rest of (72:00 - 72:04)
your life (72:02 - 72:08)
it infuriates me when they do this stuff (72:04 - 72:08)
I do wonder how many (72:11 - 72:14)
people were on Marvel and NBA I would (72:15 - 72:19)
assume probably each of those teams (72:18 - 72:22)
probably had like 100 people each (72:19 - 72:22)
um from like marketing research (72:23 - 72:26)
development (72:25 - 72:28)
it's hard to say because we don't know (72:26 - 72:31)
the swath of of overlap like (72:28 - 72:35)
we don't know like how much of the sort (72:31 - 72:37)
of just getting your company to run (72:35 - 72:40)
positions got let go so like HR and (72:37 - 72:43)
Facilities Management and administrative (72:40 - 72:47)
officers and managers like we don't know (72:43 - 72:49)
what that breakdown is and we won't (72:47 - 72:51)
every now unless they come forward but (72:49 - 72:52)
you know a lot of times when layoff (72:51 - 72:56)
happens it is the people that cover (72:52 - 72:59)
multiple teams that are like everybody (72:56 - 73:01)
has to report to you those people tend (72:59 - 73:04)
to get cut out and then they just load a (73:01 - 73:06)
person with way more than they can (73:04 - 73:08)
handle so it's really hard to say if (73:06 - 73:11)
they laid off entire teams (73:08 - 73:13)
um and just I mean if you saw Community (73:11 - 73:15)
managers on Twitter (73:13 - 73:17)
and then you saw the ones that were left (73:15 - 73:18)
over and you saw the ones that were let (73:17 - 73:20)
go and it's almost like the ones that (73:18 - 73:22)
are left over now have (73:20 - 73:24)
triple the work yeah (73:22 - 73:27)
and they're expected to do triple the (73:24 - 73:30)
work for and they were already before (73:27 - 73:32)
that that's why there was more Community (73:30 - 73:35)
managers yeah it's (73:32 - 73:38)
like I could go on again this is what (73:35 - 73:42)
happened at my job like they they when I (73:38 - 73:45)
had a nine-to-five job we had a a team (73:42 - 73:47)
of (73:45 - 73:49)
multiple website people that went down (73:47 - 73:51)
to two website people that just went (73:49 - 73:54)
down to me and they were like Steve we (73:51 - 73:56)
want you to launch a whole Rewards (73:54 - 74:00)
program before Black Friday uh okay like (73:56 - 74:02)
just you want me to also do the eight (74:00 - 74:04)
other things and now you want me to (74:02 - 74:07)
there's just me by the way they're like (74:04 - 74:10)
make it look like Amazon's Oh you mean (74:07 - 74:12)
the company that has like seven million (74:10 - 74:16)
people working on their website right it (74:12 - 74:18)
is (74:16 - 74:18)
glad you believe in me yeah because I (74:18 - 74:24)
don't but the idea is that you're left (74:22 - 74:26)
and you're so invested in this company (74:24 - 74:28)
that of course you will kill yourself to (74:26 - 74:30)
make this company succeed because we're (74:28 - 74:32)
your job and it's like (74:30 - 74:36)
I just saw you not care about 230 people (74:32 - 74:38)
do you think I'm really going to break (74:36 - 74:39)
my neck (74:38 - 74:44)
for you when you will jettison us when (74:39 - 74:46)
it becomes inconvenient to keep us like (74:44 - 74:48)
there's this again I've been talking to (74:46 - 74:50)
Brent about this a lot like we have seen (74:48 - 74:53)
so many examples lately of CEO brain (74:50 - 74:57)
that it is maddening like these CEOs (74:53 - 74:58)
think they're the smartest brightest (74:57 - 75:01)
people in the room and that they are (74:58 - 75:02)
Untouchable and the reason why they make (75:01 - 75:04)
so much money is because they're the (75:02 - 75:06)
best it's like no you are just the most (75:04 - 75:09)
ruthless and probably the least ethical (75:06 - 75:12)
person in the room (75:09 - 75:12)
that's how you got there (75:12 - 75:15)
uh (75:19 - 75:23)
uh okay well let's take one more break (75:20 - 75:26)
uh and then when we get back we'll talk (75:23 - 75:30)
about Delphox the Pokemon forums Nai n a (75:26 - 75:31)
i c (75:30 - 75:34)
North America yeah yeah uh North (75:31 - 75:36)
American Insurance Company (75:34 - 75:41)
we will be uh right back (75:36 - 75:41)
and we are back once again uh Del Fox (75:43 - 75:50)
with the fairy type Tara has joined (75:47 - 75:54)
Seven Star raid battles finally (75:50 - 75:57)
finally finally we're here (75:54 - 76:00)
it didn't break (75:57 - 76:02)
uh uh by the time you're listening to (76:00 - 76:04)
this the first round will be over it (76:02 - 76:06)
will reappear again on Thursday July (76:04 - 76:11)
13th through Sunday July 16th (76:06 - 76:12)
um (76:11 - 76:16)
uh it the coolest thing I I said this in (76:12 - 76:17)
my like preview video the coolest thing (76:16 - 76:20)
they could have it do is Magic Room uh (76:17 - 76:22)
and it does Magic Room it does I feel (76:20 - 76:23)
like (76:22 - 76:26)
99 of Pokemon fans have probably never (76:23 - 76:29)
pressed the button Magic Room ever in (76:26 - 76:30)
their playthrough or have seen anyone (76:29 - 76:33)
play it uh unfortunately it doesn't see (76:30 - 76:35)
competitive play either most people (76:33 - 76:38)
might be familiar with trick room uh (76:35 - 76:41)
because trick room gosh even trick room (76:38 - 76:42)
you probably don't even see through like (76:41 - 76:44)
a normal playthrough of the game uh but (76:42 - 76:46)
trick room will reverse the turn order (76:44 - 76:48)
so it means slow Pokemon will go first (76:46 - 76:51)
and fast Pokemon will go last uh that (76:48 - 76:53)
does see competitive play although I (76:51 - 76:56)
don't know if we've ever seen (76:53 - 76:56)
a trick room win like a masters (76:57 - 77:02)
Championship we saw in juniors actually (76:59 - 77:05)
at nasc which was really cool (77:02 - 77:06)
um (77:05 - 77:08)
but yeah Magic Room will disable all (77:06 - 77:09)
your held items for five turns it's (77:08 - 77:12)
really cool uh that it does that you can (77:09 - 77:14)
stop that by either also using Magic (77:12 - 77:18)
Room which not a lot of Pokemon get or (77:14 - 77:22)
you could taunt it as well (77:18 - 77:26)
um it is (77:22 - 77:30)
refreshing to me still that they can (77:26 - 77:32)
change when the shield goes up or they (77:30 - 77:35)
can change when you know (77:32 - 77:37)
this Pokemon's gonna go three times in a (77:35 - 77:38)
row and there's nothing you can do about (77:37 - 77:40)
it or this Pokemon's gonna open with one (77:38 - 77:42)
or two moves and there's nothing you can (77:40 - 77:44)
do about it (77:42 - 77:45)
um (77:44 - 77:46)
it is it is cool to me that they can (77:45 - 77:50)
still just like move that slider or that (77:46 - 77:51)
scale and still make each of these (77:50 - 77:54)
battles feel pretty unique versus like (77:51 - 77:57)
every raid boss is gonna do two things (77:54 - 77:58)
and then it's gonna attack and then it's (77:57 - 78:00)
gonna put up a shield and then it's (77:58 - 78:02)
gonna reset stats like every boss has (78:00 - 78:06)
been pretty unique and whether or not (78:02 - 78:09)
you know you you found it easy or hard (78:06 - 78:11)
mileage will always vary depending on (78:09 - 78:13)
who you're playing with or (78:11 - 78:15)
what poke hey you want this to be hard (78:13 - 78:19)
uh bring bring a level 63 Hoopa I (78:15 - 78:20)
promise you it will be a very hard right (78:19 - 78:22)
if you do that (78:20 - 78:25)
uh I promise you you will get one shot (78:22 - 78:28)
by Destiny and clean if you do that (78:25 - 78:32)
but um yeah I don't know Greg you did (78:28 - 78:34)
you did yours yep (78:32 - 78:38)
I did what I always do only randoms (78:34 - 78:41)
randoms how many how many randoms did it (78:38 - 78:43)
take you (78:41 - 78:44)
um (78:43 - 78:47)
three I think how many iron hands did (78:44 - 78:48)
you see (78:47 - 78:52)
I only saw one iron hands (78:48 - 78:55)
um did he probably belly drum and then (78:52 - 78:57)
die (78:55 - 78:59)
yes (78:57 - 79:01)
uh did a belly drum which I did heal but (78:59 - 79:03)
then just a drain punch and I'm like you (79:01 - 79:06)
do understand that it's fairy right no (79:03 - 79:08)
people don't understand we've learned (79:06 - 79:11)
this I I am I have never been so (79:08 - 79:14)
validated in the last 12 years of doing (79:11 - 79:16)
this podcast than to hear people time (79:14 - 79:19)
and time again be like Pokemon is a (79:16 - 79:21)
children's game it's made for kids and (79:19 - 79:24)
then watch grown adults not understand (79:21 - 79:27)
type weakness and resistance it is (79:24 - 79:30)
mind-body it's both mind-bodying and (79:27 - 79:34)
validating that to watch a 30 year old (79:30 - 79:38)
person bring a dark type Pokemon to a (79:34 - 79:40)
fairy raid and be like I don't (79:38 - 79:42)
understand why this didn't work oh I do (79:40 - 79:46)
oh I did very understand why I oh so I (79:42 - 79:50)
only played on Thursday I did I want to (79:46 - 79:53)
say three hours of just all randoms (79:50 - 79:56)
that's all I did all night because (79:53 - 79:58)
I do randoms in Final Fantasy I do (79:56 - 80:00)
random it's always interesting to be (79:58 - 80:03)
it's always interesting to me to see the (80:00 - 80:09)
evolution of when it first hits to when (80:03 - 80:11)
it later in the night when people have (80:09 - 80:14)
started actively searching up because I (80:11 - 80:16)
did start with a lot of your standards (80:14 - 80:18)
there were a lot of azumar rules there (80:16 - 80:20)
were some slowbros just sitting there (80:18 - 80:23)
powering up powering up powering up I'm (80:20 - 80:26)
like you go girl you're not gonna make (80:23 - 80:29)
it but I'm proud of you (80:26 - 80:32)
um and then towards the end of the night (80:29 - 80:35)
I started seeing a ton of heat trans (80:32 - 80:42)
a ton of armor armor armor Rouge I saw a (80:35 - 80:45)
ton of (80:42 - 80:47)
um (80:45 - 80:49)
it's a real Edge I'm assuming no what is (80:47 - 80:53)
the what is the Bisharp new thing King (80:49 - 80:56)
Gambit yeah I saw a ton of King gambits (80:53 - 80:58)
on the side good no it's not but I (80:56 - 80:59)
suddenly started seeing them as people (80:58 - 81:02)
are like oh these aren't working (80:59 - 81:04)
um and so it was really it's just really (81:02 - 81:06)
interesting to see like (81:04 - 81:08)
what happens with all of these rate like (81:06 - 81:10)
raids across the board any game that I (81:08 - 81:12)
do raids in it starts out rough and then (81:10 - 81:14)
suddenly you start seeing people who (81:12 - 81:16)
have clearly had to go and like just (81:14 - 81:19)
give me something quick that that will (81:16 - 81:22)
make this happen and so I think the (81:19 - 81:23)
start was rough and then towards the (81:22 - 81:25)
night before I just got tired of doing (81:23 - 81:26)
them (81:25 - 81:29)
I had more successes than that and to be (81:26 - 81:31)
fair I did not bring a great Pokemon (81:29 - 81:32)
that brought clouds there because it's (81:31 - 81:35)
what I had I'm like look I know enough (81:32 - 81:37)
of what I'm doing that if there's other (81:35 - 81:38)
people who are good in here I'm just (81:37 - 81:40)
gonna acid spray the Church of acid (81:38 - 81:42)
spray I'm at the church of Aston spray I (81:40 - 81:44)
have an assault vest on so as long as we (81:42 - 81:46)
can get before the Magic Room goes up (81:44 - 81:49)
I'm surviving hits (81:46 - 81:50)
um (81:49 - 81:52)
and I'm just helping people and but some (81:50 - 81:54)
people did get like I had I think I had (81:52 - 81:56)
one slow Pro that understood what I was (81:54 - 82:00)
doing and started firing uh those (81:56 - 82:01)
moments feel good (82:00 - 82:05)
um but overall I mean overall I don't (82:01 - 82:07)
I think it was interesting that it (82:05 - 82:11)
opened up with dazzling gleam because (82:07 - 82:13)
the time that I had the people who (82:11 - 82:14)
brought two people brought each (82:13 - 82:17)
legendary and they're like almost dead (82:14 - 82:19)
in the first hit and I'm like yes I (82:17 - 82:21)
really like that actually this is (82:19 - 82:25)
exciting I think that like (82:21 - 82:28)
reinforces you have made a terrible (82:25 - 82:32)
decision more raid bosses need to open (82:28 - 82:34)
with their like (82:32 - 82:37)
dominant attack right (82:34 - 82:40)
um and you know again (82:37 - 82:43)
I know how to run these I know you know (82:40 - 82:45)
I'm just there trying to help people out (82:43 - 82:47)
as best I can once I catch my own I only (82:45 - 82:49)
need to catch one and then I don't go (82:47 - 82:50)
the rest of the weekend and I probably (82:49 - 82:53)
won't go next week unless somebody sends (82:50 - 82:54)
me a message like I really need help can (82:53 - 82:56)
you come help (82:54 - 82:57)
um (82:56 - 83:00)
but it yeah I mean I think (82:57 - 83:04)
the magic room I think confused a lot of (83:00 - 83:06)
people because you don't ever see it and (83:04 - 83:08)
you're like why is it it was so cool why (83:06 - 83:11)
is it doing so much more damage all of a (83:08 - 83:13)
sudden and to be fair the first time it (83:11 - 83:15)
happened I also was like oh I'm taking a (83:13 - 83:16)
lot of damage (83:15 - 83:19)
why oh yeah I forgot I put a salt Fest (83:16 - 83:22)
on this thing yeah like I'd forgotten (83:19 - 83:24)
what I'd put on it I was just in there (83:22 - 83:27)
like hitting buttons and having fun (83:24 - 83:30)
um so yeah I think I think they made it (83:27 - 83:32)
they made it very interesting I also I (83:30 - 83:33)
love Del Fox it's one of my favorite (83:32 - 83:36)
starters I I love the design I love the (83:33 - 83:37)
typing so (83:36 - 83:39)
um it was frustrating to see a ton of (83:37 - 83:41)
people who brought in water types and (83:39 - 83:45)
I'm like okay okay (83:41 - 83:48)
like all right you're not you're still (83:45 - 83:50)
not under you're not keeping up you're (83:48 - 83:52)
not getting that it's fairy but and (83:50 - 83:54)
again to be fair (83:52 - 83:56)
a lot of these people also probably (83:54 - 83:59)
didn't know until they clicked on it and (83:56 - 84:00)
saw that it was very like it was too (83:59 - 84:03)
late because this is what I got (84:00 - 84:04)
um and I do I mean I think that is a big (84:03 - 84:08)
mentality of raids is like this is all I (84:04 - 84:12)
have right and I don't I don't (84:08 - 84:14)
I don't know if it's like I don't know (84:12 - 84:17)
what to build (84:14 - 84:17)
um or building is too time consuming or (84:17 - 84:22)
I don't have that I mean like again this (84:19 - 84:24)
is what we make fun of iron hand players (84:22 - 84:26)
or annihilate players but I think it (84:24 - 84:28)
does come down to like (84:26 - 84:30)
I don't have anything else yeah this is (84:28 - 84:32)
what I got yep and if I can make this (84:30 - 84:34)
work I'll make this work I think it is I (84:32 - 84:36)
think the barrier to rage is the same (84:34 - 84:38)
barrier to competitive Pokemon you need (84:36 - 84:41)
to know what to bring and you have to (84:38 - 84:43)
specifically design those things and the (84:41 - 84:44)
thing about these raids is that each (84:43 - 84:46)
time (84:44 - 84:48)
the whole thing is different so unlike a (84:46 - 84:50)
standard MMO where you just need to (84:48 - 84:52)
figure out how to make your class work (84:50 - 84:55)
in the raid this is very much you need (84:52 - 84:57)
to build something completely different (84:55 - 85:01)
to do this raid and I think that I think (84:57 - 85:03)
that is a barrier to entry that is tough (85:01 - 85:06)
for a lot of people because I'd looked (85:03 - 85:07)
at it and I looked at your thing and I'm (85:06 - 85:10)
like I'm I do not have time this week to (85:07 - 85:14)
make these and I'm not going to I mean I (85:10 - 85:17)
mean that's that's that's fair and like (85:14 - 85:18)
you know (85:17 - 85:20)
I think (85:18 - 85:23)
realistically you could look at one of (85:20 - 85:25)
my builds and you could and you could (85:23 - 85:27)
say like this is going to take me 30 (85:25 - 85:28)
minutes (85:27 - 85:31)
which is not a lot of time uh but if (85:28 - 85:33)
you're an adult or you're busy or you're (85:31 - 85:35)
playing other games it can be a lot of (85:33 - 85:36)
time (85:35 - 85:38)
um like I probably spent 30 minutes just (85:36 - 85:40)
moving uh Goodra back and forth Just (85:38 - 85:42)
because I wanted a silly ribbon on it (85:40 - 85:45)
before I started like trending it take a (85:42 - 85:46)
whole lot longer if you're if you're not (85:45 - 85:48)
used to it or if you're yeah (85:46 - 85:52)
obviously it could realistically it (85:48 - 85:54)
could take you 10 minutes to do it if (85:52 - 85:56)
you had vitamins right like if you have (85:54 - 85:58)
like vitamins and bottle caps you can be (85:56 - 86:00)
done in 10 minutes if you don't I'm (85:58 - 86:02)
being generous like it'd probably take (86:00 - 86:03)
you like an like 30 minutes to an hour (86:02 - 86:05)
if you don't have that kind of stuff (86:03 - 86:07)
maybe you're in Violet and you don't (86:05 - 86:09)
have a stunt tank like right like you (86:07 - 86:10)
you'd have to find somebody to trade (86:09 - 86:13)
like there there are barriers I (86:10 - 86:15)
personally do think it's fun (86:13 - 86:17)
to build a new Pokemon every raid I I (86:15 - 86:19)
absolutely love it there's 400 plus (86:17 - 86:21)
Pokemon in the game it's cool that like (86:19 - 86:23)
I finally get to use an Appleton I (86:21 - 86:26)
finally get to use a mysteryvis no one (86:23 - 86:27)
sees mestrievous I finally get to use (86:26 - 86:30)
Sandy like like it is cool to be able to (86:27 - 86:32)
build a Pokemon (86:30 - 86:35)
and it is also cool to hear that (86:32 - 86:37)
reaction from like people in slack or (86:35 - 86:40)
Discord or the twitch streams right of (86:37 - 86:42)
like I've never built a competitive (86:40 - 86:44)
Pokemon in 15 years or not well yeah I (86:42 - 86:45)
would say competitive I've never built (86:44 - 86:47)
I've never had the IV train I've never (86:45 - 86:50)
had to Evie train and it's like now that (86:47 - 86:53)
I know how to do it it's exciting when a (86:50 - 86:55)
new raid comes because like I know how (86:53 - 86:57)
to do it now and like I can prep another (86:55 - 86:58)
like (86:57 - 87:00)
I think that's a good Loop that they (86:58 - 87:03)
have introduced in Pokemon (87:00 - 87:07)
um because you know prior to VGC (87:03 - 87:10)
or maybe like some (87:07 - 87:12)
like Battle Frontier or something right (87:10 - 87:15)
or like battle battle tree and sun and (87:12 - 87:18)
moon like that's still battle focus of (87:15 - 87:20)
like okay I still have to learn (87:18 - 87:22)
competitive (87:20 - 87:24)
um and so it's easy to skip that and (87:22 - 87:25)
that's cool if you're not into that's (87:24 - 87:28)
totally cool if you're not into that (87:25 - 87:31)
um but if you want to do a co-op thing (87:28 - 87:34)
with people uh (87:31 - 87:37)
you do have to you know learn IVs and (87:34 - 87:39)
EVs and natures and (87:37 - 87:43)
strategy right like yep (87:39 - 87:45)
um like we had we had an Arceus in our (87:43 - 87:49)
raid and they they they call mind and (87:45 - 87:50)
they call mine and they call mine and (87:49 - 87:52)
I'm using acid spray right (87:50 - 87:54)
and I'm like okay it's it's negative six (87:52 - 87:57)
now three turns three acid sprays like (87:54 - 87:59)
just attack we know Delphox is gonna (87:57 - 88:02)
reset your stats and then they reset (87:59 - 88:04)
stats and so the Arceus started call (88:02 - 88:06)
mining again and they're in my chat I (88:04 - 88:08)
know they're they're only here because (88:06 - 88:09)
they're watching me I know they can hear (88:08 - 88:10)
me (88:09 - 88:14)
and uh they eventually attacked at the (88:10 - 88:15)
end and they just did a little bit of (88:14 - 88:16)
damage (88:15 - 88:18)
and (88:16 - 88:21)
it's frustrating (88:18 - 88:24)
because it it it's almost and I I said (88:21 - 88:26)
this it's like okay you you watched (88:24 - 88:28)
probably some YouTube video that told (88:26 - 88:30)
you that you know why you're by yourself (88:28 - 88:32)
you're gonna call mine and then you're (88:30 - 88:35)
gonna do this and it's gonna be fine but (88:32 - 88:37)
you didn't learn anything like you (88:35 - 88:39)
didn't learn what your teammates are (88:37 - 88:40)
doing it's the same in MMOs and Final (88:39 - 88:42)
Fantasy and stuff right like (88:40 - 88:43)
um (88:42 - 88:45)
and (88:43 - 88:47)
I think that's always what I've been (88:45 - 88:49)
trying to do with my like YouTube videos (88:47 - 88:51)
and stuff is like teaching people that (88:49 - 88:54)
there's like a complexity layer here and (88:51 - 88:56)
if you recognize patterns or you (88:54 - 88:57)
recognize what your teammates are doing (88:56 - 88:59)
you can actually be so much more (88:57 - 89:03)
efficient than like just tell me what to (88:59 - 89:05)
do and that's that's uh if you just want (89:03 - 89:08)
to be told what to do that is also (89:05 - 89:10)
completely valid but now that people are (89:08 - 89:13)
understanding how to build Pokemon and (89:10 - 89:15)
and what is good and what moves do what (89:13 - 89:18)
once you start recognizing that in other (89:15 - 89:21)
players it you can see the complexity (89:18 - 89:24)
that you might not have understood just (89:21 - 89:26)
because of the story (89:24 - 89:27)
because when you're playing again when (89:26 - 89:28)
you're playing The Story You're Never (89:27 - 89:30)
Gonna See Magic room and you're never (89:28 - 89:31)
going to be like oh what has that moved (89:30 - 89:34)
right but also like (89:31 - 89:38)
there is a level of you have to know (89:34 - 89:41)
and see because I will say this there (89:38 - 89:44)
are plenty of times where my game just I (89:41 - 89:45)
could not see what anybody else was (89:44 - 89:48)
doing I could not I just sat there I (89:45 - 89:50)
wasn't able to do things like those bugs (89:48 - 89:53)
still exist so I do think there is sort (89:50 - 89:56)
of a frustration still in the game that (89:53 - 89:59)
the game doesn't really explain how any (89:56 - 90:02)
of this works you are still in this sort (89:59 - 90:03)
of weird (90:02 - 90:06)
nebulous area and the game still doesn't (90:03 - 90:08)
work real great for you to be able to (90:06 - 90:11)
react a lot of times in particular real (90:08 - 90:14)
time like I did sit there for like (90:11 - 90:17)
a minute where I'm like I know things (90:14 - 90:19)
are happening around me but I've stopped (90:17 - 90:22)
seeing messages I can't do anything (90:19 - 90:25)
and the time it takes me to go in and (90:22 - 90:27)
look at everything is time clicking down (90:25 - 90:30)
because I'm still getting attacked I'm (90:27 - 90:33)
still trying to to see like these things (90:30 - 90:37)
aren't easily seen and sometimes (90:33 - 90:40)
Pokemon are left on the screen but their (90:37 - 90:43)
health thing's zero so I'm like (90:40 - 90:47)
are are they gone are they here (90:43 - 90:48)
yeah (90:47 - 90:51)
if I heal what's happening where are we (90:48 - 90:55)
at I I do think that (90:51 - 90:56)
um (90:55 - 90:59)
I do like that they have made (90:56 - 91:03)
more hardcore content (90:59 - 91:06)
for Pokemon I think they need to be more (91:03 - 91:10)
transparent in their communication that (91:06 - 91:13)
you have that this is more difficult (91:10 - 91:16)
content that requires you to (91:13 - 91:18)
specifically do specific things and I (91:16 - 91:21)
don't think anything official from the (91:18 - 91:23)
company has ever really crossed that (91:21 - 91:25)
barrier like that one article we read (91:23 - 91:28)
was just bad like it was half the (91:25 - 91:29)
information (91:28 - 91:31)
um and I do think (91:29 - 91:33)
that (91:31 - 91:36)
I've run into a lot of people like you (91:33 - 91:37)
know what I'm just fine there's somebody (91:36 - 91:38)
breeding it for me because I just want (91:37 - 91:40)
the Pokemon and I don't want that I find (91:38 - 91:44)
that experience frustrating uh and I (91:40 - 91:46)
don't I don't blame them because it can (91:44 - 91:48)
be super frustrating right like (91:46 - 91:49)
especially if you don't have a car group (91:48 - 91:52)
you don't have somebody you watch you (91:49 - 91:53)
don't have people (91:52 - 91:56)
that you can trust and you're relying on (91:53 - 91:58)
randoms and or you refuse to pay for a (91:56 - 92:01)
Nintendo online right I I I do think (91:58 - 92:03)
like (92:01 - 92:03)
I like the foundation they've built I do (92:04 - 92:10)
think there's a lot of room for (92:08 - 92:12)
improvement in the next iteration of (92:10 - 92:13)
this (92:12 - 92:16)
um and you know like people who listen (92:13 - 92:19)
to this podcast generally have a way to (92:16 - 92:22)
find a bunch of people to help them out (92:19 - 92:25)
with the thing so it's harder for it's (92:22 - 92:27)
harder to sort of understand (92:25 - 92:30)
other people's issues and like that is (92:27 - 92:32)
one of the reasons why I do random so I (92:30 - 92:35)
can say are people adapting are people (92:32 - 92:37)
trying to learn or are people just (92:35 - 92:38)
giving up (92:37 - 92:40)
um and I do think (92:38 - 92:45)
I'm seeing fewer people play but those (92:40 - 92:48)
people are adapting faster that's like (92:45 - 92:49)
the Final Fantasy thing though right (92:48 - 92:51)
absolutely like the destiny thing right (92:49 - 92:52)
like you get the you get the hardcore (92:51 - 92:54)
people right away they knock it out they (92:52 - 92:56)
do it then they're gone and now all the (92:54 - 92:57)
hardcore people are gone because they (92:56 - 93:00)
already did it and then you get oh you (92:57 - 93:01)
just get a you get a bunch of stragglers (93:00 - 93:04)
trying to figure it out together I only (93:01 - 93:06)
raid on Tuesdays people are like when do (93:04 - 93:08)
you play final fantastic only on Tuesday (93:06 - 93:11)
I will only rate on Tuesday because I (93:08 - 93:15)
find weekends so frustrating (93:11 - 93:15)
I do think it's I I still think it's (93:16 - 93:23)
weird that they're so (93:19 - 93:23)
secretive about like this Pokemon being (93:23 - 93:26)
level 100 (93:25 - 93:29)
and this Pokemon being tough I don't (93:26 - 93:30)
think there's anything wrong with (93:29 - 93:33)
keeping the move set Secret (93:30 - 93:34)
I think that that is fun to like (93:33 - 93:36)
discover what it is and you know if you (93:34 - 93:38)
get something wrong you're like okay let (93:36 - 93:39)
me just change let me just you know (93:38 - 93:42)
teach it this move or or (93:39 - 93:46)
uh maybe switch the nature which is much (93:42 - 93:49)
easier to do than any Pokemon game prior (93:46 - 93:52)
to it but again I again I will stand on (93:49 - 93:55)
the soapbox that I feel like (93:52 - 93:57)
ninety percent of the raids would not (93:55 - 93:59)
fail if you knew that the person is (93:57 - 94:03)
locking in like a level 64 Hoopa like I (93:59 - 94:05)
would be like you know 100 (94:03 - 94:08)
I would love to see it happen 64. this (94:05 - 94:11)
is a waste of 10 minutes like no well (94:08 - 94:13)
like there's no way this could happen (94:11 - 94:16)
what's Wild is other games tell you you (94:13 - 94:19)
have to be at this level yeah to do any (94:16 - 94:22)
of this content even in the rest of (94:19 - 94:25)
normal main series Pokemon games as much (94:22 - 94:27)
as we want to talk about that term uh or (94:25 - 94:29)
not talk about it (94:27 - 94:30)
um you can see the level of the Pokemon (94:29 - 94:33)
you're battling you know that you're (94:30 - 94:35)
gonna lose if you're going up against a (94:33 - 94:37)
70-something with a 20 something yeah (94:35 - 94:40)
it's it's weird I don't it's weird I (94:37 - 94:43)
don't know why they don't it is a weird (94:40 - 94:47)
weird Choice like (94:43 - 94:47)
just just put it put it on there it's (94:47 - 94:53)
like one thing it's not a fun part of (94:51 - 94:55)
the puzzle it's no actively hurting (94:53 - 94:58)
every team and it's not even a puzzle (94:55 - 95:01)
anymore right like once you're in the (94:58 - 95:03)
rain you can check but you can't (95:01 - 95:06)
like I could like if when I joined the (95:03 - 95:08)
raid and then I see somebody get knocked (95:06 - 95:09)
out instantly my first thought is I bet (95:08 - 95:11)
they're not level 100 and then I have to (95:09 - 95:15)
wait for them to respawn and then click (95:11 - 95:17)
on them and be like oh yep they're level (95:15 - 95:22)
49 like now I cannot like you literally (95:17 - 95:24)
cannot win yeah there's no saving it (95:22 - 95:26)
from there no most of the time (95:24 - 95:30)
it's it is (95:26 - 95:30)
I I always it's like in it's like in D (95:30 - 95:35)
and D when people are like oh you should (95:33 - 95:37)
never tell them what the two hit is and (95:35 - 95:39)
I'm like they're going to figure it out (95:37 - 95:43)
when I say a 16 misses a 17 hits you (95:39 - 95:46)
know it's 17. like this isn't a big part (95:43 - 95:49)
of puzzle just tell us up front you need (95:46 - 95:53)
to be 100 this is a 100 Pokemon like we (95:49 - 95:54)
don't need to know the moves because (95:53 - 95:58)
that is the aspect of learning the (95:54 - 96:00)
puzzle but again when you've done it (95:58 - 96:04)
once you know what it is (96:00 - 96:06)
it's not this huge it's like (96:04 - 96:09)
this bizarre like oh wait I have to take (96:06 - 96:10)
a cigarette the entire time because (96:09 - 96:13)
they'll never figure it out within two (96:10 - 96:16)
minutes of its launched (96:13 - 96:17)
infographics (96:16 - 96:20)
across every social media it's got these (96:17 - 96:24)
moves it does this and this order like (96:20 - 96:24)
who are you who are you fooling (96:24 - 96:28)
it's it's it's it's weird (96:30 - 96:33)
that being said rights are still good (96:34 - 96:38)
but man they got uh they got a uphill (96:35 - 96:41)
thing to climb if they want more people (96:38 - 96:45)
to enjoy them they're good that's the (96:41 - 96:47)
past like people who listen to this (96:45 - 96:49)
podcast I I think people at us in this (96:47 - 96:50)
podcast I think there's a lot of them (96:49 - 96:53)
that don't enjoy it though yeah (96:50 - 96:53)
uh what's our what's our next news we're (96:54 - 97:00)
we're almost we're almost done here ah (96:57 - 97:02)
well we'll save the forums for last hey (97:00 - 97:05)
I went to NAIC the North America (97:02 - 97:07)
international championships well full (97:05 - 97:09)
disclosure uh Pokemon company paid for (97:07 - 97:11)
my 11 ticket (97:09 - 97:13)
uh so thanks for the two free booster (97:11 - 97:16)
packs and the eleven dollar ticket uh (97:13 - 97:18)
what does that eleven dollar ticket get (97:16 - 97:19)
you (97:18 - 97:21)
just access to the venue that's it (97:19 - 97:22)
that's it (97:21 - 97:25)
nothing special there (97:22 - 97:28)
um they did have a Pokemon Center (97:25 - 97:32)
uh and it was free to everyone uh so you (97:28 - 97:34)
did not need a ticket (97:32 - 97:36)
uh they did have appointments for the (97:34 - 97:38)
Pokemon Center that was also not new (97:36 - 97:42)
what happens is uh you go to the website (97:38 - 97:44)
you book your time slot you can book up (97:42 - 97:46)
to four people and then when you walk up (97:44 - 97:48)
to the Pokemon Center you show them your (97:46 - 97:50)
little QR code or phone screen and then (97:48 - 97:54)
they let you in and then you can shop (97:50 - 97:54)
they sold out of uh reservations for the (97:54 - 98:02)
Pokemon Center obviously so you didn't (97:59 - 98:03)
need a reservation you could wait in (98:02 - 98:05)
line this again is not new every Pokemon (98:03 - 98:07)
Center has had this (98:05 - 98:09)
um but how they did it was really weird (98:07 - 98:12)
and I guess this is my complaint (98:09 - 98:14)
depending on who was working (98:12 - 98:16)
and for the most part most of these (98:14 - 98:19)
events are either volunteers or people (98:16 - 98:20)
they find off Craigslist to pay them (98:19 - 98:23)
like 18 an hour to stand there for two (98:20 - 98:26)
days uh some people would be like nah (98:23 - 98:27)
we're full don't get in line and then (98:26 - 98:30)
some people would be like yeah sure get (98:27 - 98:32)
in line it'll be like a two hour wait (98:30 - 98:34)
but how they would do it is they would (98:32 - 98:36)
when somebody would walk like let's say (98:34 - 98:37)
me and Hannah would walk up for a (98:36 - 98:39)
reservation I'd be like ah we're here (98:37 - 98:41)
for 2 45 and they'd be like two of you (98:39 - 98:42)
and we'd be like yeah and then they (98:41 - 98:45)
would take two people from the line (98:42 - 98:46)
and they would be like now there's four (98:45 - 98:48)
of you go on in because every (98:46 - 98:51)
reservation was expected to have four (98:48 - 98:52)
people (98:51 - 98:54)
so if Greg just went in and was like I (98:52 - 98:56)
have a three o'clock reservation they (98:54 - 98:57)
would be like just one of you and Greg (98:56 - 98:58)
would be like yeah then they would be (98:57 - 99:00)
like okay three people from line you're (98:58 - 99:03)
going in with this guy (99:00 - 99:03)
yeah obviously you didn't have to stick (99:03 - 99:07)
together but it was like that's how (99:05 - 99:10)
there was three lines by the way there (99:07 - 99:13)
was the the line to wait in there was (99:10 - 99:15)
then the line that you got approved or (99:13 - 99:17)
you got pulled and then once you got (99:15 - 99:19)
through the door into the Pokemon Center (99:17 - 99:22)
there was another line because they were (99:19 - 99:24)
limiting how many people could like walk (99:22 - 99:26)
the floor (99:24 - 99:30)
it was a nightmare and the the worst (99:26 - 99:31)
part isn't even the waiting in three (99:30 - 99:33)
different lines the worst part is when (99:31 - 99:36)
you got in nothing was in stock (99:33 - 99:38)
everything was sold out (99:36 - 99:40)
for whatever reason this has happened (99:38 - 99:43)
every single time I know Pokemon (99:40 - 99:46)
employees listen to this podcast (99:43 - 99:50)
why why is every day they are like no (99:46 - 99:53)
limit and then quickly the scalpers come (99:50 - 99:55)
in or whatever or somebody's walking in (99:53 - 99:57)
they're buying like six backpacks and (99:55 - 99:59)
then they they realize shortly after oh (99:57 - 100:00)
we should probably have a limit because (99:59 - 100:03)
now we literally have nothing to sell (100:00 - 100:05)
for day two or day three of the show (100:03 - 100:08)
like it's every single time I I was (100:05 - 100:10)
showing off stuff I got in London on (100:08 - 100:13)
stream yesterday and (100:10 - 100:15)
because Greg wanted a Rosalia from (100:13 - 100:16)
London yeah and you've held that on that (100:15 - 100:18)
you didn't even tell me you had that pin (100:16 - 100:20)
you've had this job you have the pins (100:18 - 100:23)
I watched a long time now you've held (100:20 - 100:26)
out on me so so in London it was it was (100:23 - 100:28)
Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday for the (100:26 - 100:30)
Pokemon Center there were very limited (100:28 - 100:31)
people that could get in on like (100:30 - 100:34)
Wednesday night I got in first thing I (100:31 - 100:36)
did is went to the Pokemon Center I had (100:34 - 100:38)
like a VIP pass I skipped the line I'm (100:36 - 100:39)
sorry the just being honest with you (100:38 - 100:43)
guys VIP skipped the line right (100:39 - 100:45)
already things were sold out first day (100:43 - 100:48)
of of London worlds there were no pins (100:45 - 100:51)
Greg saw the pins yesterday those were (100:48 - 100:54)
those were gone there was a huge pile of (100:51 - 100:56)
resilient plushes I grabbed one I (100:54 - 100:59)
watched some guy grab like both hands in (100:56 - 101:02)
whole scoop of Roselia plushes and then (100:59 - 101:06)
walk to the register the the second day (101:02 - 101:08)
so that was Thursday the second day they (101:06 - 101:11)
said limit two plushes per person they (101:08 - 101:13)
put a limit up the second day and like (101:11 - 101:16)
it was too late because by Friday (101:13 - 101:17)
afternoon (101:16 - 101:20)
nope nope no plushes the rest of the (101:17 - 101:22)
weekend they were all gone if you came (101:20 - 101:23)
on Saturday if you came on Sunday if you (101:22 - 101:25)
literally came Friday afternoon you were (101:23 - 101:28)
not getting a Roselia plush like I just (101:25 - 101:31)
don't understand how this is a problem (101:28 - 101:33)
every time they do a Pokemon Center (101:31 - 101:35)
everything should have a limit I'm sorry (101:33 - 101:37)
like maybe you have four kids and all (101:35 - 101:39)
four kids want a resilient plush I'm I'm (101:37 - 101:43)
sorry limit two like give your kids a 20 (101:39 - 101:46)
Bill and have them go in and have them (101:43 - 101:49)
pick up a resilient like like it is (101:46 - 101:53)
it sucks for somebody to like drive all (101:49 - 101:55)
that way or buy a spectator pass and (101:53 - 101:56)
then stay in the line for three hours (101:55 - 101:59)
all they wanted is a play mat buddy the (101:56 - 102:01)
play mats were sold within 10 they were (101:59 - 102:03)
gone they were gone within 10 minutes of (102:01 - 102:06)
this door opening like (102:03 - 102:06)
I I I didn't even get like (102:07 - 102:13)
I got it on third I got it on Thursday (102:11 - 102:15)
yes (102:13 - 102:16)
I didn't even get to go into the Pokemon (102:15 - 102:20)
Center until Saturday at like 7 45 15 (102:16 - 102:22)
minutes before they were closing it was (102:20 - 102:25)
just like it I just didn't want to wait (102:22 - 102:28)
three hours in a line (102:25 - 102:28)
there's other stuff everything else is (102:28 - 102:33)
great there was there there were side (102:31 - 102:35)
events uh the the there was enough (102:33 - 102:38)
seating to watch they put up like a cool (102:35 - 102:40)
like Beach area where you could take (102:38 - 102:42)
photos and see like the beach gear and (102:40 - 102:44)
the camping gear that you could play (102:42 - 102:45)
Pokemon Snap they had a lot of photo (102:44 - 102:48)
opportunities they had people handing (102:45 - 102:50)
out free stuff in Pokemon go they (102:48 - 102:52)
increased the amount of like gyms and (102:50 - 102:55)
pokestops uh there was uh like special (102:52 - 102:58)
research for Pansage and Panpour and pan (102:55 - 103:02)
sear like there was so much to do and it (102:58 - 103:03)
just sucks that like some people's (103:02 - 103:05)
experience was I was three hours in a (103:03 - 103:08)
line for 20 socks because that's all (103:05 - 103:12)
they had left was 20 socks (103:08 - 103:12)
the venue stunning by the way gorgeous (103:14 - 103:20)
venue very clean area around felt safe (103:17 - 103:23)
there were so many restaurants Hotel I (103:20 - 103:24)
understand (103:23 - 103:28)
why they moved from Indianapolis to Ohio (103:24 - 103:33)
the uh Hotel access just so many more (103:28 - 103:35)
hotels so many connected to the (103:33 - 103:37)
convention center so many restaurants in (103:35 - 103:39)
that area I don't know why any event is (103:37 - 103:41)
Downtown Indianapolis anymore like what (103:39 - 103:45)
restaurants are down there uh dicks (103:41 - 103:46)
where they make fun of you for putting (103:45 - 103:48)
on a hat like a steak and shake that (103:46 - 103:50)
like has their Windows broken into and (103:48 - 103:51)
like a noodles in company that's your (103:50 - 103:53)
restaurant options in downtown (103:51 - 103:55)
Indianapolis (103:53 - 103:55)
Greg report back next month no it's bad (103:55 - 104:02)
it's bad it is going to be bad it will (103:59 - 104:05)
remain bad like the the only thing that (104:02 - 104:08)
they are doing the only thing is that (104:05 - 104:11)
they pre-covet had convinced them to (104:08 - 104:14)
build three new hotels to solve the (104:11 - 104:16)
hotel crisis then covet hit and we have (104:14 - 104:19)
no idea what's happening also (104:16 - 104:22)
Indiana keeps sliding further and (104:19 - 104:25)
further down the places that anybody (104:22 - 104:28)
civilized should visit (104:25 - 104:31)
you know and it's like why are you the (104:28 - 104:33)
only reason why you're still here is (104:31 - 104:35)
because Gen Con rules that city council (104:33 - 104:37)
with an Iron Fist and can make changes (104:35 - 104:40)
but when there's no money because nobody (104:37 - 104:43)
else wants to go to Indianapolis like (104:40 - 104:45)
the amount that they can work with is (104:43 - 104:49)
limited and it isn't true you can go (104:45 - 104:51)
into you have to walk a couple blocks (104:49 - 104:53)
away before you get to the shopping mall (104:51 - 104:56)
and then it has like your standard (104:53 - 104:59)
shopping mall restaurants there's a PF (104:56 - 105:02)
Changs there's a Weber grill (104:59 - 105:06)
there's there's a Hard Rock Cafe It's A (105:02 - 105:08)
Hard Rock Cafe there's a Panera Bread (105:06 - 105:10)
but also (105:08 - 105:12)
you can't park (105:10 - 105:15)
because they have no parking that's not (105:12 - 105:19)
paid and because it's Gen Con (105:15 - 105:21)
it's full anyways (105:19 - 105:23)
because there's no parking (105:21 - 105:25)
and (105:23 - 105:28)
no matter where you go (105:25 - 105:31)
the things within walking distance are (105:28 - 105:33)
devastated you will walk in there and (105:31 - 105:37)
think a World War just happened today (105:33 - 105:40)
and the staff looks like (105:37 - 105:43)
one one more thing is going to push them (105:40 - 105:47)
over the edge like one more moment of (105:43 - 105:49)
these inconsiderate people is just that (105:47 - 105:51)
is going to be it and they're all going (105:49 - 105:56)
to walk off yeah it's bizarre how (105:51 - 105:56)
they don't (105:56 - 106:02)
how little that City actually cares (105:58 - 106:06)
about usability which also speaks to the (106:02 - 106:08)
fact that until there's a convention (106:06 - 106:12)
there nobody uses that City (106:08 - 106:15)
yeah I I I I can't speak for the rest of (106:12 - 106:16)
Ohio (106:15 - 106:19)
I loved my time in Columbus I was very (106:16 - 106:21)
impressed by that City the cleanliness (106:19 - 106:24)
the hotels the restaurant options the (106:21 - 106:27)
store options like I I wish my flight (106:24 - 106:29)
wasn't delayed like a whole day because (106:27 - 106:32)
I wish I did just have a one non-pokemon (106:29 - 106:35)
day in that City like there were so many (106:32 - 106:38)
unique restaurants within easy walking (106:35 - 106:41)
distance that I had like I I couldn't I (106:38 - 106:43)
couldn't go to all of them and everyone (106:41 - 106:46)
I went to had banger food holy cow the (106:43 - 106:49)
food in Columbus so good it was and and (106:46 - 106:52)
I hate food I don't like I I drink (106:49 - 106:55)
liquid food but what I'm saying I was (106:52 - 106:58)
impressed by the food in in Indianapolis (106:55 - 107:00)
and for the record I understand that Gen (106:58 - 107:02)
Con is a much bigger event than than (107:00 - 107:03)
Pokemon I I totally understand that but (107:02 - 107:06)
like that doesn't change Indianapolis as (107:03 - 107:09)
a city like you don't have a lot of food (107:06 - 107:11)
options like do you want to go to (107:09 - 107:13)
Noodles because that is probably on your (107:11 - 107:16)
list of things to do because otherwise (107:13 - 107:19)
you're going to wait like three hours at (107:16 - 107:20)
a food truck (107:19 - 107:22)
like you sometimes you just want (107:20 - 107:23)
something fast and easy and (107:22 - 107:26)
unfortunately you're one of your one (107:23 - 107:28)
option is Noodles and Company like (107:26 - 107:32)
that's all you got uh (107:28 - 107:35)
so yeah I guess I guess uh Pokemon fix (107:32 - 107:39)
your Pokemon Center situation uh uh add (107:35 - 107:42)
unite side games there was no unite side (107:39 - 107:44)
games unfortunately apparently somebody (107:42 - 107:46)
uh (107:44 - 107:48)
one of the staff members talked about (107:46 - 107:51)
they were scared to do unite because (107:48 - 107:54)
they wanted (107:51 - 107:57)
Lan options for unite side games but (107:54 - 107:58)
they were scared that it was going to (107:57 - 108:01)
steal too much internet from the main (107:58 - 108:05)
games and cause something (108:01 - 108:07)
but they are looking into unite side (108:05 - 108:10)
games in the future (108:07 - 108:12)
um which they had a lot of they had a (108:10 - 108:15)
lot of TCG sod games they had a lot of (108:12 - 108:19)
uh VGC side games uh the the prize wall (108:15 - 108:21)
was great I mean ultimately a side game (108:19 - 108:22)
is you spend five dollars (108:21 - 108:25)
to get into it if you win you get a (108:22 - 108:27)
bunch of points if you lose you still (108:25 - 108:29)
get some points you take all your points (108:27 - 108:30)
into the prize wall you could but (108:29 - 108:34)
skateboard plushes TCG cards like that (108:30 - 108:36)
whole system they have is slowly gotten (108:34 - 108:39)
better over the years (108:36 - 108:41)
um I mean back in the day when when I (108:39 - 108:45)
used to do TCG your side games were only (108:41 - 108:48)
TCG and your only prizes were (108:45 - 108:51)
tcg booster packs and at that point it (108:48 - 108:54)
was like (108:51 - 108:54)
but um (108:55 - 108:59)
uh very impressed with the event uh it (108:57 - 109:02)
was it was really really great uh I (108:59 - 109:03)
think (109:02 - 109:05)
I think I could probably safely say that (109:03 - 109:10)
ni NAIC is worth traveling to (109:05 - 109:12)
um I think a regionals (109:10 - 109:15)
is not worth getting on a plane for but (109:12 - 109:18)
if you are in that City or if it's like (109:15 - 109:21)
a two hour drive it's worth going to but (109:18 - 109:23)
I don't think (109:21 - 109:25)
I don't think a regionals is is worth (109:23 - 109:28)
like a weekend trip for unless obviously (109:25 - 109:29)
if your computer regionals are worth (109:28 - 109:31)
more if you are either competing (109:29 - 109:33)
obviously or if you know other people (109:31 - 109:35)
who are going to be there it's kind of a (109:33 - 109:38)
a less fun experience if you're just (109:35 - 109:41)
going there by yourself (109:38 - 109:41)
um NAIC I think (109:42 - 109:46)
I don't think it would maybe take all (109:44 - 109:48)
weekend unless you're really into side (109:46 - 109:50)
events uh but I think (109:48 - 109:52)
no I I no I take that I think I think (109:50 - 109:53)
you get a whole weekend out of it (109:52 - 109:55)
honestly but like that is assuming that (109:53 - 109:56)
you want to do a little they had a play (109:55 - 109:59)
lab there as well so if you wanted to (109:56 - 110:01)
like learn the TCG you literally waited (109:59 - 110:03)
like the play lab line was much shorter (110:01 - 110:04)
than the Bookman Center Line you wait in (110:03 - 110:06)
line for like 30 minutes they give you (110:04 - 110:08)
like a free deck it's not like a full (110:06 - 110:10)
deck it's like a 40 card deck and then (110:08 - 110:12)
they teach you how to play the TCG which (110:10 - 110:14)
is like a really great experience as (110:12 - 110:18)
well I will say though like (110:14 - 110:18)
I don't know how much if you're a parent (110:18 - 110:22)
and you I know there's lots of parents (110:20 - 110:23)
that was in the show (110:22 - 110:25)
and I I know there's the stigma of like (110:23 - 110:28)
this is a child's child's thing there's (110:25 - 110:31)
not a lot for kids to do like I don't (110:28 - 110:32)
think you want to pay five dollars and (110:31 - 110:33)
have your kids go in a side event and (110:32 - 110:35)
like just like leave them there unless (110:33 - 110:38)
you want to watch them but like uh but (110:35 - 110:42)
people do oh yeah yeah when I hosted a (110:38 - 110:44)
room at the Midwest Gaming Classic (110:42 - 110:47)
there would be parents gosh and they (110:44 - 110:49)
would like come into the room and they (110:47 - 110:52)
would be like all right Sally uh daddy's (110:49 - 110:54)
gonna go uh play the pinball machine for (110:52 - 110:56)
two hours is it cool if you you're gonna (110:54 - 110:58)
stay here for two hours and they would (110:56 - 111:00)
just dump their kid in the Pokemon room (110:58 - 111:02)
and I was like what am I gonna do what (111:00 - 111:05)
I'm not this does not say babysitting (111:02 - 111:06)
like (111:05 - 111:09)
I would watch this seven-year-old like (111:06 - 111:11)
get bored relatively quickly because (111:09 - 111:14)
spoiler alert I'm not a parent but like (111:11 - 111:16)
I'm smart enough to recognize most (111:14 - 111:18)
people are I think that like a (111:16 - 111:20)
seven-year-old gets bored with things (111:18 - 111:23)
very quickly (111:20 - 111:26)
uh and I I would watch these kids just (111:23 - 111:30)
leave the room and just ex like I don't (111:26 - 111:33)
know where they went yeah when also not (111:30 - 111:36)
my job to babies like where did I don't (111:33 - 111:40)
know the who knows where they went the (111:36 - 111:43)
wild convention when I worked at a comic (111:40 - 111:45)
book store the wildest thing that (111:43 - 111:46)
happened in the summer says parents (111:45 - 111:47)
would drive up drop their kids off (111:46 - 111:49)
because they had to go to work and send (111:47 - 111:51)
them into our store and those kids would (111:49 - 111:54)
last 20 minutes before I kicked them out (111:51 - 111:56)
because they were destroying things (111:54 - 111:58)
and then we would just see them playing (111:56 - 112:01)
in the parking lot I'm like (111:58 - 112:01)
we are not taking care of your child I (112:03 - 112:07)
don't care what happens to your child (112:05 - 112:11)
your child was actively ruining my store (112:07 - 112:13)
they're out (112:11 - 112:15)
I don't know what your plan is and I (112:13 - 112:16)
hope (112:15 - 112:18)
they're around when you return at (112:16 - 112:20)
whatever you're coming back because (112:18 - 112:22)
I don't care once they're out of my (112:20 - 112:26)
store goodbye (112:22 - 112:26)
there aren't a lot of safe places to be (112:26 - 112:31)
as a kid (112:28 - 112:33)
especially another yeah (112:31 - 112:37)
I don't know yeah I mean like I I I felt (112:33 - 112:40)
bad yeah like when when you're hosting (112:37 - 112:43)
it's not your job right yeah when you're (112:40 - 112:45)
hosting a room all weekend like also I'm (112:43 - 112:48)
not taking the liability of your child (112:45 - 112:50)
yeah I'm not saying that these (112:48 - 112:52)
necessarily are safe places I'm just (112:50 - 112:54)
knowing yeah (112:52 - 112:57)
as a kid who grew up (112:54 - 112:59)
like there there are people my parents (112:57 - 113:01)
age who were able to go to malls and go (112:59 - 113:04)
hang out in arcades and and and have (113:01 - 113:08)
safe places to go as as a kid they were (113:04 - 113:10)
not safe (113:08 - 113:13)
they were not they were you didn't get (113:10 - 113:16)
in trouble for being in a place yes we (113:13 - 113:19)
did okay no they were not they were not (113:16 - 113:22)
safe okay and they got as tired of us as (113:19 - 113:25)
I did we got I got kicked out of so many (113:22 - 113:27)
arcades they're like you're done (113:25 - 113:30)
awesome you're done you're out of money (113:27 - 113:33)
get out uh I don't know I'm part of the (113:30 - 113:34)
generation that grew up on the Internet (113:33 - 113:37)
because yeah we got kids out of malls (113:34 - 113:39)
all the time because we would just roam (113:37 - 113:41)
we would just roam balls as packs of (113:39 - 113:43)
teens because we had nothing else to do (113:41 - 113:44)
and then security would come around and (113:43 - 113:48)
say get out get out you are done and (113:44 - 113:50)
then we would do what every kid did (113:48 - 113:53)
wonder the parking lots because our (113:50 - 113:55)
parents literally pushed us outside and (113:53 - 113:58)
said figure it out (113:55 - 114:00)
okay I'll see you at five (113:58 - 114:03)
see I was the opposite I was the kid (114:00 - 114:04)
that like never left my parents were (114:03 - 114:06)
like oh you want to go to the park no (114:04 - 114:08)
you can't do you that would require that (114:06 - 114:10)
would require crossing the street and (114:08 - 114:12)
you are not allowed to cross the street (114:10 - 114:14)
oh oh thank you my mom would have liked (114:12 - 114:16)
if I left the house more but I I was a (114:14 - 114:18)
nerd who liked reading and playing video (114:16 - 114:20)
games (114:18 - 114:23)
I wanted to like go to the parks or like (114:20 - 114:25)
if I had a friend that lived across a (114:23 - 114:27)
street the street they'd be like nope (114:25 - 114:28)
because we don't want you to cross the (114:27 - 114:30)
street oh my parents said that but of (114:28 - 114:31)
course they weren't home (114:30 - 114:34)
so we had to stay at home like my my mom (114:31 - 114:37)
was like stay at home yeah no my parents (114:34 - 114:41)
did not exist in that house we just left (114:37 - 114:44)
it's like well who's gonna stop us (114:41 - 114:48)
bye we out (114:44 - 114:48)
um yeah so uh (114:48 - 114:52)
NAIC uh good (114:52 - 114:57)
um hopefully they continue to improve uh (114:55 - 114:59)
it seemed I mean NAC they sold out so (114:57 - 115:03)
they they sold out of Badges and stuff (114:59 - 115:04)
um so it's cool that they keep doing (115:03 - 115:05)
that (115:04 - 115:09)
uh that means worlds is coming up uh I (115:05 - 115:11)
will I will be there uh I've known this (115:09 - 115:13)
for a while I was waiting until (115:11 - 115:15)
everything was mostly finalized (115:13 - 115:20)
in my real life before I announced it uh (115:15 - 115:23)
but I will be in Yokohama (115:20 - 115:25)
um whenever that is I think it's the (115:23 - 115:29)
eight the the 10th 10th 11th 12th for (115:25 - 115:31)
worlds uh the Pokemon company did invite (115:29 - 115:34)
me out I'm not saying that to brag I am (115:31 - 115:36)
saying that because of FTC guidelines I (115:34 - 115:38)
have to tell you that they are paying (115:36 - 115:40)
for my hotel legally I have to tell you (115:38 - 115:42)
that otherwise I get in trouble (115:40 - 115:43)
um and they get in trouble and if (115:42 - 115:45)
Pokemon gets in trouble because I am (115:43 - 115:47)
vague in what they're paying for then (115:45 - 115:49)
they don't want to invite me to stuff (115:47 - 115:53)
because that's how the law works so uh (115:49 - 115:54)
they're not paying for my flight they (115:53 - 115:57)
they have paid for my hotel (115:54 - 116:00)
um and so I will be at the Osa just for (115:57 - 116:02)
that week they're not paying for three (116:00 - 116:04)
weeks of hotel (116:02 - 116:04)
I think for a week of hotel I will be at (116:04 - 116:09)
the Osaka go Fest Niantic is paying for (116:06 - 116:12)
my 20 ticket to that for the record (116:09 - 116:14)
um so I will be at Osaka go Fest I will (116:12 - 116:16)
be at Worlds and then I'm staying an (116:14 - 116:19)
extra week on my own dime uh to live (116:16 - 116:23)
stream so uh shout out to everyone in (116:19 - 116:26)
Australia and Europe they will be easy (116:23 - 116:28)
to watch if you're in the US and you're (116:26 - 116:29)
a night owl (116:28 - 116:32)
then you have something to watch if (116:29 - 116:35)
other because Japan is (116:32 - 116:38)
13 hours ahead I think (116:35 - 116:39)
so if I start at 10 in the morning (116:38 - 116:41)
that's like (116:39 - 116:44)
midnight (116:41 - 116:44)
for America (116:44 - 116:51)
uh but yeah I will uh I will be at (116:48 - 116:54)
Worlds so if you're there cool now all (116:51 - 116:56)
of you guys know why I won't be at New (116:54 - 116:59)
York go Fest I'll be at go Fest (116:56 - 117:02)
Hannah will be there with a cardboard (116:59 - 117:04)
cutout of me (117:02 - 117:06)
I still don't have a job if you want to (117:04 - 117:09)

um (117:23 - 117:27)
Safari Zone or a go Fest (117:24 - 117:29)
so I'm very excited for that even if my (117:27 - 117:31)
feelings about the game are kind of (117:29 - 117:33)
hesitant right now (117:31 - 117:36)
yeah I uh I believe (117:33 - 117:39)
um some of my Discord mods are planning (117:36 - 117:43)

I like I tried tooth and nail to (118:40 - 118:46)
leave Japan slightly early to make it to (118:43 - 118:49)
New York go Fest but uh it was very hard (118:46 - 118:51)
to my ticket change was a thousand (118:49 - 118:55)
dollars and is it like do I want to (118:51 - 118:56)
spend a thousand dollars to leave Japan (118:55 - 118:59)
early to then get another flight to New (118:56 - 119:01)
York out of New York and then (118:59 - 119:04)

and just be in Japan for like three (119:04 - 119:11)
extra days so I I tried yeah I had the (119:06 - 119:13)
choice I I was choosing between either (119:11 - 119:15)
