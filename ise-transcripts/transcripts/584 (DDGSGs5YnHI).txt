what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:28)
584 episode of the Pokémon podcast it's (0:25 - 0:30)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:28 - 0:36)
me is Greg hello it is fall officially (0:30 - 0:39)
in Minnesota cuz it's cold and Cup Foods (0:36 - 0:42)
has decided that every aisle should be a (0:39 - 0:44)
Halloween candy (0:42 - 0:49)
aisle literally literally every aisle (0:44 - 0:51)
like everywhere I go and it doesn't help (0:49 - 0:53)
that like here's tortilla chips and (0:51 - 0:54)
somebody has dropped off a big bag of (0:53 - 0:56)
Kit Kats because they decided they (0:54 - 0:57)
didn't want it two aisles later they're (0:56 - 0:59)
like just toss it (0:57 - 1:01)
there (0:59 - 1:04)
Hannah also here I am here it is also (1:01 - 1:06)
fall here and the sign of that is that (1:04 - 1:10)
it turned rainy immediately it's SLI the (1:06 - 1:12)
switch just rain now now all you get is (1:10 - 1:14)
rain (1:12 - 1:17)
mhm not great for walking outside with (1:14 - 1:19)
Pokémon go (1:17 - 1:22)
look it only rained a little bit here (1:19 - 1:24)
yesterday and towards the end of the day (1:22 - 1:26)
my dogs hated every minute of it because (1:24 - 1:27)
they will not go outside when it's (1:26 - 1:29)
raining this is this is a constant (1:27 - 1:33)
problem is they refuse to go outside (1:29 - 1:35)
while it's raiding which is a problem (1:33 - 1:36)
because they also need to use the (1:35 - 1:39)
bathroom this is a constant rain (1:36 - 1:41)
struggle with those (1:39 - 1:44)
two can't win them (1:41 - 1:48)
all uh speaking of winning uh we have (1:44 - 1:50)
some Pokemon sleep news that's game's (1:48 - 1:54)
impossible to win (1:50 - 1:58)
uh uh I don't know if you guys know this (1:54 - 2:01)
but Scarlet Violet uh (1:58 - 2:03)
has some issues and there was another (2:01 - 2:05)
issue that popped up well we're gonna be (2:03 - 2:07)
talking about that that (2:05 - 2:11)
seems impossible on such a fine and (2:07 - 2:16)
Polished product how dare you speak (2:11 - 2:22)
ill um and you know uh scalping exists (2:16 - 2:23)
and we're going to talk about that for (2:22 - 2:27)
another product this week so uh you that (2:23 - 2:31)
that one that I well get (2:27 - 2:33)
I should be surprised but when I saw the (2:31 - 2:38)
thing I'm like oh of course oh of course (2:33 - 2:41)
this is why we can't have nice things (2:38 - 2:44)
it's true it's true uh okay let's uh (2:41 - 2:46)
let's kick off with the Pokemon sleep (2:44 - 2:48)
news this is what like two months in a (2:46 - 2:50)
row we've been consistently covering (2:48 - 2:52)
this game so we'll just continue to do (2:50 - 2:54)
it uh they put out their own little (2:52 - 2:58)
press release this is off Pokemon (2:54 - 2:58)
sleep.now (2:59 - 3:06)
I it better be slash news uh so this is (3:01 - 3:08)
this was put out two days ago as of (3:06 - 3:10)
recording this it said thank you for (3:08 - 3:12)
playing Pokemon sleep again seems very (3:10 - 3:14)
official although the net always throws (3:12 - 3:17)
me off um our sleep tends to be shorter (3:14 - 3:19)
and shallower during the full moon (3:17 - 3:23)
however we found that on the night of (3:19 - 3:25)
the full moon during good sleep day the (3:23 - 3:28)
average duration of all your researchers (3:25 - 3:31)
researches researchers around the world (3:28 - 3:34)
was 11 minutes longer than average so (3:31 - 3:38)
they're saying um on Wednesday August (3:34 - 3:43)
30th our average sleep was 600 and 600 6 (3:38 - 3:47)
hours and 41 minutes which was an (3:43 - 3:51)
11 11 minute increase over the average (3:47 - 3:54)
uh and then uh on Thursday which was the (3:51 - 3:56)
day of the full moon it was 6 hours and (3:54 - 3:58)
39 minutes which is a 12% 12 minute (3:56 - 4:01)
increase and then Friday 6 hours and 54 (3:58 - 4:03)
minutes which is a 10minute (4:01 - 4:06)
increase um they said thank you all for (4:03 - 4:08)
sleeping more than usual to further your (4:06 - 4:11)
sleep research we plan to hold another (4:08 - 4:14)
good sleep Day event from uh September (4:11 - 4:18)
28th which is a Thursday to uh September (4:14 - 4:20)
30th which is a Saturday uh so you can (4:18 - 4:23)
sleep just as well during the next full (4:20 - 4:27)
moon uh please look I this game has a (4:23 - 4:31)
choke hold on me I now have Moon (4:27 - 4:35)
uh I have a moon calendar now I it I I (4:31 - 4:36)
open up my calendar and I'm like I know (4:35 - 4:38)
that there's going to be a half moon (4:36 - 4:42)
quarter moon semicircle moon I I I need (4:38 - 4:45)
to know in advance when the full moon is (4:42 - 4:47)
coming you only need to know the full (4:45 - 4:49)
moon that's it well the the calendar (4:47 - 4:51)
gave me all of them I subscribed to it (4:49 - 4:53)
and put it all (4:51 - 4:57)
in you don't sleep as it is like how is (4:53 - 4:59)
this really affecting your life in any (4:57 - 5:02)
meaning knowing that it's a full moon (4:59 - 5:04)
Steve sleeps just not at the right time (5:02 - 5:09)
yes that's true I have stayed in a hotel (5:04 - 5:10)
room with this indivual we all friends (5:09 - 5:14)
in Pokemon sleep I do sleep just not at (5:10 - 5:17)
see the numbers the traditional time (5:14 - 5:20)
um I I put all my Pokemon events in the (5:17 - 5:22)
calendar like usually at the start of (5:20 - 5:24)
the month when Niantic releases their (5:22 - 5:26)
like here's the here's your next month (5:24 - 5:28)
of scams I'm like okay on Tuesday it's (5:26 - 5:31)
going to be Slowpoke on so I I do update (5:28 - 5:32)
my Pokemon calendar so I can try to (5:31 - 5:35)
manage so like good sleep day is just (5:32 - 5:38)
another Pokemon event now in my (5:35 - 5:42)
calendar and it is the mood calendar is (5:38 - 5:44)
giving me the heads up cuz then I know (5:42 - 5:45)
where the next full mood's going to be (5:44 - 5:49)
for October yes I don't know why they (5:45 - 5:51)
seem to announce them so close to the (5:49 - 5:54)
actual event date because I don't sadly (5:51 - 5:58)
people are going to stock up on sleep or (5:54 - 5:59)
I'm going to deprive myself of sleep (5:58 - 6:02)
sleep for the week before so I could (5:59 - 6:06)
really crash out during the full (6:02 - 6:06)
moon October 28th for the record for (6:06 - 6:14)
October and then plan ahead November (6:11 - 6:16)
27th after that see my calendar is (6:14 - 6:20)
working I know the the full the full (6:16 - 6:23)
moon good sleep whatever I mean every (6:20 - 6:25)
calendar I've ever had CU I still when I (6:23 - 6:27)
had an office job I used to have a wall (6:25 - 6:28)
calendar and they always told me when (6:27 - 6:31)
the full moon was because you just go (6:28 - 6:32)
home and you lock the door so you don't (6:31 - 6:33)
get attacked by werewolves I mean that (6:32 - 6:37)
is just a given that that makes sense I (6:33 - 6:39)
that that is just how it (6:37 - 6:44)
goes speaking of the next full (6:39 - 6:47)
moon um they're saying this is off their (6:44 - 6:48)
official (6:47 - 6:51)
Twitter 3-day event we already covered (6:48 - 6:52)
that enjoy peaceful nights of sleep (6:51 - 6:55)
bonuses and new encounters the night of (6:52 - 6:58)
the Harvest Moon and if we look very (6:55 - 7:02)
closely at the Moon there is a Clefairy (6:58 - 7:05)
silhouette in the moon two yeah there's (7:02 - 7:06)
one at like top I couldn't tell if that (7:05 - 7:08)
was clef or just another (7:06 - 7:12)
Clefairy um or just another poke Pokemon (7:08 - 7:14)
in general I don't know this this shape (7:12 - 7:17)
maybe is a landeras with legs uh that's (7:14 - 7:21)
there's a Mewtwo in there it is a little (7:17 - 7:22)
hard to tell there's like that's (7:21 - 7:25)
probably a Gengar at some point I see (7:22 - 7:28)
two clearies yeah there's definitely (7:25 - 7:30)
like if I decide to see can see three or (7:28 - 7:34)
four if I'm really trying so let's let's (7:30 - 7:37)
not trust on human pattern recognition (7:34 - 7:39)
here but yeah there's definitely (7:37 - 7:42)
one um (7:39 - 7:45)
so that's cool I guess I I think there's (7:42 - 7:48)
only one metronom in the game right now (7:45 - 7:51)
which is Togepi so probably safe to (7:48 - 7:53)
assume that I don't know the Pokemon (7:51 - 7:54)
that uses metronome will probably have (7:53 - 7:57)
the metronome (7:54 - 8:00)
ability which I don't know if that's (7:57 - 8:02)
a great (8:00 - 8:04)
ability what is the spreadsheets you (8:02 - 8:06)
never sent me the spreadsheets so I (8:04 - 8:06)
don't know I never sent you the (8:06 - 8:09)
spreadsheets apparent so apparently like (8:06 - 8:12)
uh Caterpie Metapod Butterfree that's (8:09 - 8:14)
like one of the best lines to get (8:12 - 8:17)
because they're their ingredient (8:14 - 8:22)
Harvesters or whatever they No Sleep (8:17 - 8:22)
powder um you know the more I use (8:22 - 8:29)
Pokemon sleep the more I appre I don't (8:26 - 8:31)
know appreciate that as the right word I (8:29 - 8:33)
understand what they're doing now with (8:31 - 8:35)
their like sleep tracking like it's very (8:33 - 8:37)
it's very (8:35 - 8:40)
simplified but like the little bar chart (8:37 - 8:43)
they show at the end that isn't that (8:40 - 8:46)
helpful that's also really simly random (8:43 - 8:48)
it's pretty inaccurate I think mine is (8:46 - 8:50)
really inaccurate I think mine is really (8:48 - 8:52)
wild inaccurate this like today we're (8:50 - 8:54)
just going to draw this I think the more (8:52 - 8:57)
I use it the more accurate it it feels (8:54 - 8:59)
because now because I can look at it and (8:57 - 9:02)
I can I can be like I did get out of bed (8:59 - 9:04)
here I did wake up and look at the clock (9:02 - 9:08)
here it gets that pretty consistently (9:04 - 9:11)
but any more detail than that I don't (9:08 - 9:13)
that's not even correct on mind but then (9:11 - 9:15)
then again but you you have like 18 dogs (9:13 - 9:17)
in your bed I have multiple things (9:15 - 9:19)
happening in my bed at any given time (9:17 - 9:20)
which which makes sense why it wouldn't (9:19 - 9:22)
be accurate for you it's just like (9:20 - 9:25)
whatever there was a time though I think (9:22 - 9:27)
it was last week I think when Kaiju (9:25 - 9:30)
actually sat on the button (9:27 - 9:33)
cuz he wanted to be on my head and so he (9:30 - 9:36)
came up and plopped down to pod my head (9:33 - 9:39)
cuz sometimes he just decides I want to (9:36 - 9:41)
hit your head for a while and he was (9:39 - 9:46)
just fully sitting on the Plus+ button (9:41 - 9:48)
and I'm like well it's random anyways (9:46 - 9:54)
who cares and then the P (9:48 - 9:54)
Pikachu I am out of gems officially I (9:56 - 10:04)
have put all my free gems into uh the (9:59 - 10:08)
the expanding either inventory storage (10:04 - 10:11)
or the other stage that's probably the (10:08 - 10:13)
best thing I have a lot of room in my (10:11 - 10:15)
storage and there's one of those bonus (10:13 - 10:17)
items that keeps telling me I can't put (10:15 - 10:19)
it in my bag cuz I don't have enough (10:17 - 10:22)
room and I'm like is it like the 40 rare (10:19 - 10:23)
candy or something they gave yeah (10:22 - 10:26)
whatever the the small dream thing or (10:23 - 10:28)
whatever yeah I've like emptied out my (10:26 - 10:30)
bag as much as willing to do and it's (10:28 - 10:32)
still I'm like well whatever I don't (10:30 - 10:34)
care enough for it to find out of how I (10:32 - 10:36)
should fix it it's like I'll just spend (10:34 - 10:38)
your gems it really is the best thing to (10:36 - 10:39)
spend gems on I think yeah they're (10:38 - 10:43)
permanent upgrades yeah but I'm at (10:39 - 10:47)
40 out of 120 spots according to my bag (10:43 - 10:49)
thing and it says there's 20 of these (10:47 - 10:53)
gems and it still says you don't have (10:49 - 10:54)
enough (10:53 - 10:58)
room I'm like well then I guess up your (10:54 - 11:00)
ingredient bag or your actual other bag (10:58 - 11:03)
actual other bag you have two bags I (11:00 - 11:05)
know those (11:03 - 11:09)
bags I've spent out of both to bring (11:05 - 11:12)
them down into acceptable levels as and (11:09 - 11:15)
then I probably said you know what this (11:12 - 11:18)
is already eating up way too much of my (11:15 - 11:21)
time if it's I don't even know I don't (11:18 - 11:22)
even know what these candies are (11:21 - 11:25)
supposed to give me in the game to care (11:22 - 11:27)
enough to get them into my bag well the (11:25 - 11:29)
dream shards are pretty useless I think (11:27 - 11:30)
everyone is agreeing that like there's a (11:29 - 11:32)
like you can upgrade your pot with the (11:30 - 11:33)
dream shards and then you can upgrade (11:32 - 11:36)
Pokemon but if you've been playing yeah (11:33 - 11:37)
if you've been playing consistently you (11:36 - 11:39)
just have so much and there's really (11:37 - 11:41)
nothing else I've never not had an S (11:39 - 11:42)
week (11:41 - 11:46)
so I've never had an S my week is f all (11:42 - 11:50)
the time okay no i' I have S I've had an (11:46 - 11:53)
S week since this game started and it's (11:50 - 11:56)
been s the entire time like I don't know (11:53 - 12:00)
anything less than an s on this thing (11:56 - 12:01)
I think Hannah brought this up like the (12:00 - 12:03)
second week the game came out where it (12:01 - 12:06)
it decides that a brand new day is 4:00 (12:03 - 12:10)
a.m. MH which is my sleep time (12:06 - 12:12)
technically um because I normally sleep (12:10 - 12:18)
from 4:00 to noon and so if I go to bed (12:12 - 12:19)
at like (12:18 - 12:24)
4:02 on Sunday going into Monday I've (12:19 - 12:27)
missed all of Sunday and that is my (12:24 - 12:30)
Monday day but then on Monday if I'm (12:27 - 12:33)
like exhausted and I decide to go to bed (12:30 - 12:36)
at 3:00 a.m. that's still Monday for (12:33 - 12:39)
me yep and and then if I go to bed on (12:36 - 12:42)
Tuesday at like 4:02 I have now missed (12:39 - 12:44)
Tuesday because that's considering it (12:42 - 12:47)
Wednesday so it I don't know how other (12:44 - 12:50)
sleep apps deal with that or do they or (12:47 - 12:51)
other sleep apps don't care because it's (12:50 - 12:53)
not a game so they're just like I think (12:51 - 12:55)
sleep apps care other sleep apps mostly (12:53 - 12:58)
don't care but usually it counts as the (12:55 - 13:01)
next day instead of of the previous (12:58 - 13:03)
day so when you're sleeping if you're (13:01 - 13:05)
sleeping between Monday and Tuesday at (13:03 - 13:07)
some point usually that counts as (13:05 - 13:09)
Tuesday's sleep in Pokémon go that (13:07 - 13:12)
counts as Monday's sleep and it gets a (13:09 - 13:14)
little (13:12 - 13:17)
Annoying yeah cuz I feel like it's dis (13:14 - 13:19)
there was a (13:17 - 13:21)
day I'm sorry to admit this there was a (13:19 - 13:24)
day where I was super (13:21 - 13:26)
tired and I was like but if I stay up (13:24 - 13:29)
for one more hour this is making bad (13:26 - 13:32)
sleep habits it'll rotate into the next (13:29 - 13:37)
day and then I can get a good 8 hours (13:32 - 13:40)
for that day a. is the worst hour for a (13:37 - 13:43)
reason and CH yeah no it is it's really (13:40 - 13:46)
bad I actually like how their own the (13:43 - 13:48)
time I go to bed the most I like how (13:46 - 13:51)
their own average sleep times has (13:48 - 13:54)
everybody at 6 and 1 half hours and (13:51 - 13:57)
their goal is 8 and 1 half it's like in (13:54 - 13:59)
uh the other sleep apps of used the (13:57 - 14:01)
countries that tend to have the lowest (13:59 - 14:04)
average sleep are the US and Japan and (14:01 - 14:07)
so I'm assuming that is playing a (14:04 - 14:11)
fairly has a fairly large impact on (14:07 - 14:14)
these average sleep times yeah but also (14:11 - 14:17)
the eight eight hours thing isn't real (14:14 - 14:19)
or is eight and a half hours they just (14:17 - 14:21)
picked a time like I don't know I feel (14:19 - 14:23)
like when I get in and a half hours I'm (14:21 - 14:26)
feeling pretty good do need more people (14:23 - 14:27)
generally do need more sleep than (14:26 - 14:30)
they're getting it's the problem of the (14:27 - 14:32)
systems and not the people yeah I got (14:30 - 14:34)
remember Hannah that Greg is over like (14:32 - 14:38)
50 now so yeah my I mean so so it's only (14:34 - 14:40)
less and less sleep as Greg gets older (14:38 - 14:42)
it's not necessarily that you need less (14:40 - 14:44)
sleep it's just that sleep is harder I (14:42 - 14:49)
watch this man slam a g fuel at 2 a.m. (14:44 - 14:51)
and then immedately pass out I don't (14:49 - 14:53)
know you're you can't trust anything (14:51 - 14:56)
sleep related Greg is saying no I'm all (14:53 - 14:58)
I'm saying is we know that everybody at (14:56 - 15:00)
different ages needs different amounts (14:58 - 15:04)
of sleep I have crossed over one of the (15:00 - 15:07)
thresholds where I no longer am expected (15:04 - 15:10)
to sleep fully for eight hours that I've (15:07 - 15:14)
been I've been moving down to the six to (15:10 - 15:16)
six to seven hour range because I'm (15:14 - 15:19)
getting older I'm also expected to take (15:16 - 15:21)
like a far hour at night and a far hour (15:19 - 15:24)
in the middle of the day as I age (15:21 - 15:26)
but you need to figure out your own (15:24 - 15:28)
sleep schedule and don't go off of a (15:26 - 15:30)
game that's says it's 8 and 1/2 hours (15:28 - 15:31)
cuz you may never need 8 and 1/2 hours (15:30 - 15:35)
there are a huge number of people who (15:31 - 15:38)
only ever need seven and that is their (15:35 - 15:40)
life and they will never like if you (15:38 - 15:42)
force them to sleep another hour and a (15:40 - 15:44)
half they are (15:42 - 15:46)
miserable yeah but the averages aren't (15:44 - 15:48)
even reaching that right and these (15:46 - 15:50)
averages aren't even reaching that but (15:48 - 15:53)
also the question is how much what are (15:50 - 15:56)
the ages who are using this I'm like so (15:53 - 15:59)
curious of there's no way like it's not (15:56 - 16:01)
adults there's no way like 10-year-olds (15:59 - 16:03)
are slamming the Pika button and (16:01 - 16:06)
listening I mean there could be teens (16:03 - 16:08)
and teens have very different schedules (16:06 - 16:10)
and very different needs that oh yeah I (16:08 - 16:11)
mean when I was in high school I was (16:10 - 16:13)
running off like five four or five hours (16:11 - 16:15)
of sleep like every single day yeah I'm (16:13 - 16:19)
just curious what their breakup of age (16:15 - 16:23)
groups are who's actually using the app (16:19 - 16:24)
and I don't think they're collecting (16:23 - 16:26)
that information I don't think they are (16:24 - 16:28)
I I mean I'm sure they could I'm sure (16:26 - 16:29)
they have (16:28 - 16:31)
but they're probably generalizing it and (16:29 - 16:34)
not releasing it from what I remember (16:31 - 16:36)
asking them at that event I liked that (16:34 - 16:39)
in the uh report when they were (16:36 - 16:40)
explaining how everybody's sleep was (16:39 - 16:42)
slightly more during good sleep day they (16:40 - 16:44)
did say that this was only numbers for (16:42 - 16:47)
people who had one bout of sleep and who (16:44 - 16:49)
weren't taking naps so naps didn't bring (16:47 - 16:52)
the averages down this is theoretically (16:49 - 16:56)
actual night's sleep being about 6 hours (16:52 - 16:57)
and 40 (16:56 - 17:00)
minutes (16:57 - 17:02)
I liked noticing that that was a good (17:00 - 17:03)
detail I like the way that the Pokemon (17:02 - 17:05)
sleep team is going about things in (17:03 - 17:08)
general they communicate more in a week (17:05 - 17:09)
than like (17:08 - 17:13)
right every other game combined they're (17:09 - 17:15)
like what can we tell our people this (17:13 - 17:18)
week we another $50 box is coming we (17:15 - 17:21)
have a lot we can say that the unite (17:18 - 17:24)
people have got real quiet after their (17:21 - 17:26)
press release that has been proven to be (17:24 - 17:27)
very much not (17:26 - 17:30)
true (17:27 - 17:33)

McDonald's (18:47 - 18:51)
bundle have okay here's a question for (18:48 - 18:53)
for (18:51 - 18:57)
you have you noticed the the Pokemon DCd (18:53 - 19:00)
trick-or treat pack in more stores this (18:57 - 19:03)
year than last year I see it everywhere (19:00 - 19:06)
it is everywhere I went I went to Costco (19:03 - 19:08)
they had them at Costco I went to (19:06 - 19:11)
Walgreens I went to Cub I went to Target (19:08 - 19:13)
all of them had it and I'm like what is (19:11 - 19:16)
going on this I think they just I think (19:13 - 19:19)
they just overprinted it for like good (19:16 - 19:22)
re like I think I think it's like a good (19:19 - 19:24)
for the record to anyone listening if if (19:22 - 19:29)
you are in the tax bracket to afford to (19:24 - 19:32)
give out Halloween candy or Halloween (19:29 - 19:33)
whatever and you want to deal with (19:32 - 19:38)
children I do think the booer packs are (19:33 - 19:40)
are cool (19:38 - 19:43)
um and pretty inexpensive I think (19:40 - 19:44)
they're I think they're the better (19:43 - 19:46)
alternative to Candy have you seen the (19:44 - 19:49)
price of candy it's a cand is very (19:46 - 19:50)
expensive all of well everything's (19:49 - 19:54)
expensive all expensive all the booster (19:50 - 19:57)
packs are so much cheaper than like a (19:54 - 20:00)
bag of mini Skittles or whatever that (19:57 - 20:03)
you could be handing out but here's the (20:00 - 20:07)
thing I can't eat booster (20:03 - 20:10)
packs and not pass them out to children (20:07 - 20:12)
I can't have the excuse of I'm buying (20:10 - 20:15)
candy for the kids and then probably eat (20:12 - 20:18)
it all I can't do that with booster (20:15 - 20:20)
packs you can open the packs though CRA (20:18 - 20:22)
yeah I know but then I have more stuff (20:20 - 20:22)
in my (20:22 - 20:26)
house it was enjoy it it's it's fun I (20:22 - 20:28)
bought it last year and I was not able (20:26 - 20:32)
to hand out all of them cuz nobody was (20:28 - 20:33)
in the neighborhood I was in at that (20:32 - 20:36)
time um and so I just opened one (20:33 - 20:37)
whenever I was feeling (20:36 - 20:40)
sad it made me happy get that dopamine (20:37 - 20:44)
hit of opening a package (20:40 - 20:48)
yes for me that would be gone in a day (20:44 - 20:50)
then just rip rip (20:48 - 20:53)
rip um by the time you're listening to (20:50 - 20:56)
this this Raid event will be over uh but (20:53 - 21:00)
there was a Slither wing and iron moth (20:56 - 21:02)
Paradox raid event uh they didn't have (21:00 - 21:03)
any like special rewards it was pretty (21:02 - 21:07)
much the same as um Iron (21:03 - 21:11)
tuskin Iron Treads and gray dusk there (21:07 - 21:16)
we go one of those Pokemon um I would I (21:11 - 21:17)
would assume there would be like a (21:16 - 21:21)
roaring Moon SL iron (21:17 - 21:23)
Valiant and I don't know what they would (21:21 - 21:27)
pair scream tail up with but you would (21:23 - 21:29)
think they would do all the Paradox (21:27 - 21:32)
eventually oh probably (21:29 - 21:32)
eventually I mean this is basically so (21:33 - 21:38)
that you could get the one from the (21:35 - 21:40)
other game it's like get the thing from (21:38 - 21:42)
the other game event and complete your (21:40 - 21:44)
Pokedex if you didn't do the Weir still (21:42 - 21:46)
need two yeah the weird area zero (21:44 - 21:49)
everybody's invisible to each other (21:46 - 21:50)
multiplayer EV I haven't checked since (21:49 - 21:52)
the update if that was like I haven't (21:50 - 21:55)
check either I didn't even think about (21:52 - 21:57)
that but (21:55 - 22:00)
yeah I I mean (21:57 - 22:04)
like the only way to get the other one (22:00 - 22:07)
is to still have Nintendo (22:04 - 22:09)
online so if you have Nintendo online (22:07 - 22:11)
you can connect to the Poke portal you (22:09 - 22:12)
can see all the raids you can join the (22:11 - 22:15)
other one and or (22:12 - 22:17)
um if you have Nintendo online you could (22:15 - 22:18)
also just trade (22:17 - 22:20)
somebody well you could technically (22:18 - 22:22)
trade somebody without Nintendo online (22:20 - 22:24)
but you would have to be local You' have (22:22 - 22:26)
to be in person yeah it's hidden behind (22:24 - 22:31)
a pay wall there there (22:26 - 22:31)
uh hanah's face is (22:31 - 22:36)
braceless (22:33 - 22:40)
um I think the reason like the this it (22:36 - 22:42)
was it was it was confusing to me until (22:40 - 22:44)
people would come into my stream and be (22:42 - 22:46)
like do you have any solo builds and I (22:44 - 22:48)
would be like no just play with other (22:46 - 22:52)
people it's more efficient and easier (22:48 - 22:54)
and you will get it done quicker and (22:52 - 22:57)
nine times out of 10 the rebuttal was I (22:54 - 22:59)
don't have Nintendo (22:57 - 23:01)
online which (22:59 - 23:03)
is kind of wild to (23:01 - 23:08)
me because in my head maybe I'm I just (23:03 - 23:12)
always had Nintendo online cuz like just (23:08 - 23:15)
I I've just always and it's what like 20 (23:12 - 23:18)
I think for a family it's like 35 a year (23:15 - 23:20)
for a person it's (23:18 - 23:22)
25 but a family I think is like eight (23:20 - 23:25)
people or something or six it's like a (23:22 - 23:26)
lot of people can go on a Nintendo (23:25 - 23:28)
family cuz like I no cuz isn't (23:26 - 23:31)
individual (23:28 - 23:31)
20 individuals 20 and families (23:32 - 23:38)
35 I think you're right yeah let me go (23:35 - 23:42)
to the website let me look uh both of (23:38 - 23:44)
those though are pretty inexpensive I (23:42 - 23:45)
mean I think it's one of my least (23:44 - 23:48)
expensive Subs subscriptions yeah yeah I (23:45 - 23:50)
mean $20 a year (23:48 - 23:52)
but I mean I can (23:50 - 23:55)
understand also if you're looking at it (23:52 - 23:56)
like are you just so 20 bucks is just (23:55 - 23:59)
for Nintendo switch online if you want (23:56 - 24:00)
the online with the expansion packs (23:59 - 24:04)
that's $50 a year yeah and $80 a year (24:00 - 24:07)
with expansion packs for the for the (24:04 - 24:11)
family so I mean I get it I mean also (24:07 - 24:14)
who doing the expansion pass I $30 to (24:11 - 24:17)
play like Pokemon Snap I mean some (24:14 - 24:20)
people just don't have that like the if (24:17 - 24:23)
the only reason why they're going to pay (24:20 - 24:25)
for Nintendo online is (24:23 - 24:29)
every three months there might be a raid (24:25 - 24:32)
they want to do that's 20 bucks thrown (24:29 - 24:36)
out the window right like that is just (24:32 - 24:38)
a I don't need this I don't play with (24:36 - 24:41)
other people this is a waste of my (24:38 - 24:43)
money and people don't have credit cards (24:41 - 24:47)
to pay for okay so as a kid in my head (24:43 - 24:50)
Pokemon was a $40 game right Game Boy (24:47 - 24:53)
games were 3540 or whatever depend like (24:50 - 24:55)
Toys R Us they were 40 my parents would (24:53 - 24:57)
always be like we got we got to wait for (24:55 - 24:59)
the the Coal's discount we got to wait (24:57 - 25:01)
for the Kohl's cash to get Pokemon Red (24:59 - 25:04)
over here in clearance um but like as a (25:01 - 25:07)
kid I always thought like the Link cable (25:04 - 25:10)
was a necessity of Pokemon I mean they (25:07 - 25:13)
advertised it this way for 27 years of (25:10 - 25:15)
like this is a game you play with other (25:13 - 25:16)
people so I understand there are (25:15 - 25:18)
introverts out there that are like I (25:16 - 25:20)
only play solo games I never play with (25:18 - 25:22)
anyone I don't have any brothers or (25:20 - 25:24)
sisters I don't have any friends but (25:22 - 25:26)
that's never what Pokemon was advertised (25:24 - 25:29)
for so in my head it was always is like (25:26 - 25:32)
the online thing is such like the the (25:29 - 25:33)
communicating and playing with other (25:32 - 25:36)
people is such an integral part of (25:33 - 25:39)
Pokemon and there are so many Pokemon (25:36 - 25:41)
games that at this point like if it was (25:39 - 25:43)
just let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee I'd (25:41 - 25:44)
be like okay I get why you're not (25:43 - 25:47)
spending 20 bucks a year but it's let's (25:44 - 25:49)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee Legends archus (25:47 - 25:51)
diamond and pearl sword and shield sword (25:49 - 25:54)
and shield expansive like you're so like (25:51 - 25:57)
if your main thing is Pokemon and you've (25:54 - 25:59)
purchased all all of these games or at (25:57 - 26:01)
least four or five of these games the (25:59 - 26:04)
$20 is like the (26:01 - 26:04)
smallest expense out of all of that for (26:04 - 26:10)
a better experience like doing raides (26:08 - 26:12)
with people is a better experience like (26:10 - 26:16)
being able to those I don't know how big (26:12 - 26:18)
the that VIN diagram is of people who (26:16 - 26:21)
purchased every possible game and have (26:18 - 26:23)
the disposable income to buy every game (26:21 - 26:24)
what else are you doing on the switch (26:23 - 26:27)
playing Mario Kart you look there's a (26:24 - 26:30)
bunch of freebie cheapy stuff on there (26:27 - 26:33)
too what do I I mean I play unite on it (26:30 - 26:34)
that's about the only thing I use my (26:33 - 26:35)
switch for right now and you don't need (26:34 - 26:38)
Nintendo online for that because (26:35 - 26:41)
apparently free to-play games get around (26:38 - 26:42)
this is the same on like PlayStation as (26:41 - 26:45)
well the freeto playay games get around (26:42 - 26:48)
the Nintendo online for whatever reason (26:45 - 26:51)
I don't know what the legal like I I (26:48 - 26:53)
don't think Pokemon scarlet and violet (26:51 - 26:55)
could be like not Nintendo our players (26:53 - 26:56)
will (26:55 - 26:59)
avoid yeah I don't know what weird rules (26:56 - 27:00)
they have but I do know the one rule is (26:59 - 27:03)
if your game is like fortnite you don't (27:00 - 27:06)
need Nintendo (27:03 - 27:08)
online which is it would kind of ruin (27:06 - 27:10)
the free-to-play model in some ways yeah (27:08 - 27:14)
a little bit a little (27:10 - 27:17)
bit (27:14 - 27:17)
um okay what time let's let's take a (27:17 - 27:23)
break look we we have more to talk about (27:20 - 27:26)
slitherwing and iron moth is there (27:23 - 27:27)
anything else to talk about that's it (27:26 - 27:28)
right (27:27 - 27:31)
I don't I don't know (27:28 - 27:34)
they're they're they're gone aren't they (27:31 - 27:36)
it ended (27:34 - 27:36)
today did you here before we go to break (27:37 - 27:43)
uh this is not a story spoiler for the (27:41 - 27:46)
record it is a reward spoiler I suppose (27:43 - 27:48)
but we pretty much spoiled everything (27:46 - 27:50)
last week yeah did you guys finish your (27:48 - 27:55)
kitakami Pokedex yes not quite yet I had (27:50 - 27:59)
the white basculin white stripe basculin (27:55 - 28:02)
problem I I issue but I did get to (27:59 - 28:05)
200 uh you get the little um so if you (28:02 - 28:06)
finish the kidami Pokédex you just get (28:05 - 28:10)
the Terra charm or whatever it's called (28:06 - 28:12)
yeah glistening charm I think it maybe (28:10 - 28:17)
is called something but it gives you way (28:12 - 28:19)
more Tera Shard a lot more Tera shards a (28:17 - 28:21)
lot more Tera shards it gives you if (28:19 - 28:23)
you're in a six-star raid I think it (28:21 - 28:25)
guarantees you an extra 12 no matter (28:23 - 28:27)
what if you're in a five star I think (28:25 - 28:31)
it's like an extra like nine yeah I did (28:27 - 28:34)
a bunch of meww after I got it and I (28:31 - 28:37)
don't remember what I got but I was like (28:34 - 28:39)
swimming in shards now it's really easy (28:37 - 28:41)
cuz it's it you scroll down it's the (28:39 - 28:44)
final reward yeah so for like six I mean (28:41 - 28:47)
always like plus 12 I don't remember (28:44 - 28:49)
what it was I looked and I'm like oh (28:47 - 28:51)
cool I got more and then I promptly (28:49 - 28:54)
jedicon that information out of my (28:51 - 28:57)
brain well I I I play scarlet and violet (28:54 - 28:59)
a lot so anytime there's a sevenstar (28:57 - 29:01)
raid I get to (28:59 - 29:05)
999 tarot shards of whatever that raid (29:01 - 29:08)
boss is giving and then I usually have (29:05 - 29:10)
to sell some and then I continue doing (29:08 - 29:13)
the raid and I'm back at (29:10 - 29:14)
999 (29:13 - 29:17)
so the other alternative is like (29:14 - 29:20)
grinding out Blissey MH and Blissey was (29:17 - 29:22)
giving a lot of shards but this is (29:20 - 29:28)
giving a lot more shards um so I wonder (29:22 - 29:30)
like like out of all the shards I think (29:28 - 29:33)
the ones I never have is is I think it's (29:30 - 29:35)
like steel like steel is like really (29:33 - 29:37)
good especially for like golden go um so (29:35 - 29:40)
there's like two it's like whatever (29:37 - 29:41)
whatever they haven't done for seven (29:40 - 29:43)
star raids which is definitely steel and (29:41 - 29:46)
I think maybe dark and then those are (29:43 - 29:47)
the ones I'm always low on but (29:46 - 29:50)
everything else I'm at like 999999 (29:47 - 29:55)
whatever and now that this item has (29:50 - 29:55)
existed I don't know if that (29:55 - 30:02)
like I am obviously not the average (29:59 - 30:05)
Pokemon player there's that for sure so (30:02 - 30:08)
so I think the the the sh the the charm (30:05 - 30:10)
is averaging that out for other people (30:08 - 30:13)
but I wonder if there will be something (30:10 - 30:17)
else to do with shards in the next DLC (30:13 - 30:20)
cuz I feel like this item is almost a (30:17 - 30:22)
little too (30:20 - 30:25)
late cuz I feel like you either never (30:22 - 30:27)
have enough or you have too much and (30:25 - 30:29)
this item if you never have enough it's (30:27 - 30:30)
probably just cuz you're just not (30:29 - 30:32)
playing a lot which is like fine some (30:30 - 30:34)
people just play or you're just not (30:32 - 30:37)
playing raids a lot yeah not everybody (30:34 - 30:38)
does quite so many raids I think that (30:37 - 30:40)
some people are going to be really happy (30:38 - 30:43)
about this item but I also do expect (30:40 - 30:45)
that whole rainbow Tera thing in the (30:43 - 30:50)
second DLC to maybe make it more (30:45 - 30:52)
necessary yeah there maybe there may be (30:50 - 30:54)
a Shard eater maybe there's a crar (30:52 - 30:56)
machine that you have shards into (30:54 - 31:01)
o here tery is just the (30:56 - 31:03)
crammer here's my other question to you (31:01 - 31:06)
did you pick up your free egg this is a (31:03 - 31:09)
spoiler mhm I picked it up literally (31:06 - 31:10)
after I beat the (31:09 - 31:13)
game or the yeah yeah I hatched it I (31:10 - 31:15)
hatched it okay who did you (31:13 - 31:18)
get I got (31:15 - 31:20)
Chimchar I also got (31:18 - 31:24)
Chimchar I hatched it and promptly (31:20 - 31:24)
forgot it was not Chimchar I'm pretty (31:25 - 31:31)
sure hat Gen 4 confirmed (31:28 - 31:35)
confirmed confirmed anger over brilliant (31:31 - 31:37)
diam and Shining Pearl oh wait no I got (31:35 - 31:41)
a t twig that's it oh I'm looking for a (31:37 - 31:43)
Piplup actually I did not really look (31:41 - 31:45)
you don't have one in Pokemon home I (31:43 - 31:47)
have a million in Pokemon home I can (31:45 - 31:49)
just pass over I'm just trying to find (31:47 - 31:51)
somebody who actually hatched a Piplup (31:49 - 31:53)
just to see who if it like if any of (31:51 - 31:55)
them were more rare than the others this (31:53 - 31:57)
is a completely informal and (31:55 - 32:00)
unscientific ific poll uh but so far (31:57 - 32:03)
nobody I know has gotten Piplup so (32:00 - 32:06)
Piplup is the rare egg is I you heard it (32:03 - 32:08)
here first and that's (32:06 - 32:11)
it uh can I complain real quick I never (32:08 - 32:14)
get to complain on the (32:11 - 32:21)
show no but go ahead I'm so tired of Gen (32:14 - 32:26)
4 it was a mistake to release two gen 4 (32:21 - 32:29)
games or whatever you want to call it C (32:26 - 32:31)
games whatever (32:29 - 32:33)
like and the fact that brilliant Diamond (32:31 - 32:36)
shining Pearl was a faithful remake did (32:33 - 32:40)
no benefits to anyone help the situation (32:36 - 32:43)
there is nothing exciting about Shinx or (32:40 - 32:48)
Starly or beof or whatever other early (32:43 - 32:51)
route Gen 4 Pokemon anytime I now see (32:48 - 32:53)
them in a game I'm just like I'm I'm (32:51 - 32:56)
done I don't I don't care about you you (32:53 - 32:58)
have been Overexposed (32:56 - 32:59)
yeah and they took away the one (32:58 - 33:01)
important one (32:59 - 33:03)
B (33:01 - 33:06)
so hey they had to make some some Gen 4 (33:03 - 33:09)
Cuts yeah they made bad ones they should (33:06 - 33:12)
have cut GE dude shins even even in (33:09 - 33:14)
Legends archus they were like here's a (33:12 - 33:16)
bunch of geod dudes and then in this DLC (33:14 - 33:19)
they're like here's some more buch gudes (33:16 - 33:21)
here's a thousand (33:19 - 33:25)
Pokemon pick something (33:21 - 33:25)
else all right show me on the geodo (33:25 - 33:30)
where it hurt (33:28 - 33:33)

emotional damage happened (33:33 - 33:39)
there please just give us like another (33:36 - 33:42)
200 more (33:39 - 33:44)
Pokemon I (33:42 - 33:47)
mean how I mean didn't wasn't Gen 4 one (33:44 - 33:49)
of the bigger (33:47 - 33:52)
editions or is that Gen 5 gen 5 was the (33:49 - 33:53)
biggest Gen (33:52 - 33:59)
5 156 Pokemon Gen 4 was not a lot of new (33:53 - 34:02)
Pokemon but a lot well not a lot L (33:59 - 34:04)
Evolutions there a lot of evolutions for (34:02 - 34:06)
families I want to say it was close to (34:04 - 34:08)
100 wasn't (34:06 - 34:12)
it yeah I think that is correct and (34:08 - 34:14)
something 100 that's why when the C Fest (34:12 - 34:16)
for Pokemon go comes out it's going to (34:14 - 34:20)
be real uh real (34:16 - 34:20)
light you know I'm tired of seeing from (34:24 - 34:28)
gen (34:27 - 34:30)
for (34:28 - 34:32)
gastrodon tired of getting it for free (34:30 - 34:35)
I'm tired of being around I'm tired of (34:32 - 34:38)
it being a fake shiny is it pink is it (34:35 - 34:42)
blue what are you I'm over it get out (34:38 - 34:45)
it's the everpresent sea slug it's just (34:42 - 34:48)
there never ending everybody uses it (34:45 - 34:49)
we're going to give 18,000 of them out (34:48 - 34:51)
for (34:49 - 34:54)
free oh you know speaking of Nintendo (34:51 - 34:56)
online and speaking of trading and (34:54 - 34:58)
speaking of gastrodon (34:56 - 35:00)
I forgot this was a thing I noticed it (34:58 - 35:03)
very early on when the game came out but (35:00 - 35:05)
when you're trading with somebody i' had (35:03 - 35:06)
a friend messaged me and be like I'm (35:05 - 35:08)
missing iron bundle can you help me out (35:06 - 35:10)
real quick so I can get my shiny charm I (35:08 - 35:13)
was like bet I got iron bundle I'm sing (35:10 - 35:14)
nothing but iron (35:13 - 35:17)
bundles my nickname in high school iron (35:14 - 35:22)
bundle okay so the game will show you (35:17 - 35:26)
what they're missing in your PC boxes (35:22 - 35:28)
there will be a little white glow around (35:26 - 35:29)
those (35:28 - 35:32)
Pokemon and when I was trading them I (35:29 - 35:34)
was like oh you're missing gastrodon and (35:32 - 35:36)
they were like no I have a gastrodon I (35:34 - 35:39)
just need bundle but it was saying that (35:36 - 35:42)
they were missing the pink gastrodon oh (35:39 - 35:45)
cuz my pink asons were lit up but my (35:42 - 35:47)
blue ones were not so it's really cool (35:45 - 35:50)
that it like senses different (35:47 - 35:54)
forms um so I thought like I'm pretty (35:50 - 35:57)
sure it was like you know this game has (35:54 - 35:58)
very few issues but I'm pretty sure that (35:57 - 36:00)
the the the trading thing was like (35:58 - 36:02)
slightly broken when it first came out I (36:00 - 36:03)
think they fixed it with like the first (36:02 - 36:06)
or second patch um but then I completely (36:03 - 36:09)
forgot cuz I don't really trade anyone (36:06 - 36:10)
and then when I was trading last night I (36:09 - 36:12)
was like oh yeah like it lights up (36:10 - 36:14)
Pokemon you're missing and now that (36:12 - 36:15)
there's more Pokemon and there's like (36:14 - 36:18)
forms like it lit up like white stripe (36:15 - 36:21)
and I was like they already had you know (36:18 - 36:23)
red or whatever um so it's just like a (36:21 - 36:28)
really neat and cool feature um that I'm (36:23 - 36:31)
pretty sure was introduced in gen this (36:28 - 36:32)
generation I don't think it was yeah I (36:31 - 36:34)
don't remember it existing before I (36:32 - 36:37)
don't remember it lighting up in any way (36:34 - 36:40)
shape or form like hey you're missing (36:37 - 36:41)
this person I don't remember that (36:40 - 36:44)
feature before so I think it's new (36:41 - 36:45)
there's always like the trading feature (36:44 - 36:48)
of like oh just trade me whatever I (36:45 - 36:50)
don't know what I want and it's like (36:48 - 36:52)
well I see you're now missing Sandstorm (36:50 - 36:55)
vivon so I I guess you said whatever so (36:52 - 36:57)
I guess I'll trade you the form of vivon (36:55 - 37:00)
you're missing I still need to connect (36:57 - 37:03)
my go to this whole I haven't done any (37:00 - 37:07)
of that I can't the the thought of doing (37:03 - 37:10)
all that and transferring postcards over (37:07 - 37:13)
is so emotionally and mentally (37:10 - 37:14)
exhausting to (37:13 - 37:18)
me that I can't even begin to start the (37:14 - 37:22)
steps of doing it cuz I know what I it's (37:18 - 37:25)
very easy you could have a Von party and (37:22 - 37:28)
do more than one at once (37:25 - 37:30)
but then I have to go to the place and I (37:28 - 37:33)
have to catch it and then I have to do (37:30 - 37:36)
all for a for for Pokemon that I already (37:33 - 37:40)
have one of every that I use the GTS to (37:36 - 37:43)
get all the forms from like I don't want (37:40 - 37:45)
to do this again I already did it once (37:43 - 37:47)
it was exhausting then you got to do it (37:45 - 37:49)
so you can update your LinkedIn profile (37:47 - 37:52)
that you have all the vivon in your OT (37:49 - 37:56)
look I'm losing faith and Linked In (37:52 - 37:59)
everybody I have listed so many none of (37:56 - 38:01)
them have gotten me a job people have (37:59 - 38:04)
lost faith in LinkedIn years (38:01 - 38:07)
ago the entire (38:04 - 38:09)
time the (38:07 - 38:13)
weird uselessness slash absolute (38:09 - 38:17)
necessity of LinkedIn really needs to be (38:13 - 38:20)
studied because nobody wants to use it (38:17 - 38:22)
but if you're looking for a job it is (38:20 - 38:27)
the only way to find a job it is so like (38:22 - 38:29)
it is one of the few social media (38:27 - 38:33)
platforms where it's like you only need (38:29 - 38:36)
it when you need it and when you need it (38:33 - 38:38)
you absolutely have to be on it every (38:36 - 38:41)
day isn't that like a dating app (38:38 - 38:44)
though no dating apps you can be real (38:41 - 38:46)
casual with LinkedIn if you want a job (38:44 - 38:49)
you canot be casual with LinkedIn you (38:46 - 38:51)
could be casual (38:49 - 38:55)
job Dad if you need (38:51 - 38:55)
one we got to take a (38:56 - 39:03)
break uh we'll be uh right back and we (38:59 - 39:07)
are back from our break all right (39:03 - 39:09)
speaking of scarlet and (39:07 - 39:11)
violet another (39:09 - 39:15)
issue oh yes impossible this one okay th (39:11 - 39:18)
this issue doesn't break anything it is (39:15 - 39:21)
it is unfortunate and I also think like (39:18 - 39:24)
99% of players probably don't have this (39:21 - 39:27)
issue it's very specific (39:24 - 39:30)
so uh this is off I just grabb Pokey (39:27 - 39:33)
jungle's tweet front front of the show (39:30 - 39:35)
Pokey jungle uh some players have had (39:33 - 39:37)
trouble completing things such as the (39:35 - 39:39)
kitakami ogre Clan Quest because (39:37 - 39:41)
trainers were not properly saved as (39:39 - 39:44)
defeated Pokemon has announced a patch (39:41 - 39:46)
will be released in the first half of (39:44 - 39:49)
October to fix this uh I couldn't find (39:46 - 39:51)
that initial tweet I did see it at one (39:49 - 39:53)
point um yeah I saw it at some point I (39:51 - 39:54)
saw I saw it at some point and then (39:53 - 39:56)
promptly forgot to save it that's why I (39:54 - 39:58)
grabbed Pokey jungles but they did they (39:56 - 40:00)
did officially State early October I (39:58 - 40:03)
think they announced that on Tuesday I (40:00 - 40:06)
believe Monday was like a holiday in (40:03 - 40:09)
Japan so that makes sense um and then (40:06 - 40:11)
Anubis which we've talked about her (40:09 - 40:14)
before um she is I I don't know if I (40:11 - 40:16)
would consider her a data minor I don't (40:14 - 40:18)
know what she considers herself but she (40:16 - 40:20)
does a lot of testing over and over and (40:18 - 40:22)
then figures out stuffs and then tells (40:20 - 40:26)
us um so she said that the game can only (40:22 - 40:28)
remember three 300 trainers (40:26 - 40:31)
defeated um so that means if you battled (40:28 - 40:34)
every single person in Pala and then you (40:31 - 40:36)
went to kakami and then you battled all (40:34 - 40:38)
those people there's in total between (40:36 - 40:40)
the DLC and the expansion I think in (40:38 - 40:45)
total there's 307 trainers between it um (40:40 - 40:48)
so that's why I cannot remember some of (40:45 - 40:50)
the ogre Clan cuz you probably might (40:48 - 40:53)
have saved ogre ogre Clan to be last (40:50 - 40:55)
because they're the harder trainers and (40:53 - 40:57)
then you defeat them and then all of a (40:55 - 41:00)
sudden the game goes battle them again (40:57 - 41:01)
and you battle them again and then all (41:00 - 41:02)
of a sudden the game goes battle cuz the (41:01 - 41:06)
game can only remember (41:02 - 41:06)
300 (41:06 - 41:11)
which I guess you could say like didn't (41:09 - 41:14)
they test this I don't know did they (41:11 - 41:17)
have a play tester battle every (41:14 - 41:17)
single I think that's one of those (41:18 - 41:23)
things where (41:20 - 41:23)
it's just you know you you battled so (41:24 - 41:30)
many of them that you made sure (41:29 - 41:32)
everything worked and they all worked (41:30 - 41:34)
but you were never really because I I (41:32 - 41:35)
don't think this has ever happened (41:34 - 41:38)
before so it's probably was just (41:35 - 41:43)
never in a UA testing thing like hey we (41:38 - 41:45)
did we change something that would (41:43 - 41:47)
create a limit or did we have more (41:45 - 41:50)
trainer battles in this game than normal (41:47 - 41:52)
and that it always had been this limit (41:50 - 41:54)
but it was just never (41:52 - 41:57)
hit in any other the games before like (41:54 - 42:00)
who knows when this bug was actually (41:57 - 42:01)
introduced (42:00 - 42:06)
and believe me you test a lot of things (42:01 - 42:10)
but you cannot test (42:06 - 42:10)
everything the the shocking thing here (42:12 - 42:16)
is there's more than 300 trainers in (42:14 - 42:19)
these games like well that's the thing I (42:16 - 42:22)
don't I feel like that's a lot a (42:19 - 42:25)
lot and I don't I can't think that (42:22 - 42:27)
there's that many in sword and shield (42:25 - 42:30)
who who's battling these people who I (42:27 - 42:32)
battled as many as I could find I don't (42:30 - 42:35)
think I found all of them I see them in (42:32 - 42:39)
the field it's a friendly wave as I zip (42:35 - 42:43)
on by hope you're having a good day I (42:39 - 42:46)
want nothing to do with you you to make (42:43 - 42:48)
the little dialogue box disappear you (42:46 - 42:50)
will give me nothing but (42:48 - 42:54)
grief I understand that but (42:50 - 42:58)
also in in the (42:54 - 43:01)
in the early game I was like (42:58 - 43:04)
oh this isn't worth my time I don't (43:01 - 43:06)
really need the money they're they're (43:04 - 43:08)
they're they're not f for me they (43:06 - 43:11)
weren't even fun to find of like there (43:08 - 43:14)
are five trainers in this area battle (43:11 - 43:15)
them and come back and you do the first (43:14 - 43:17)
one and then you come back and he gives (43:15 - 43:19)
you like an Orin Berry and you're like (43:17 - 43:20)
this wasn't worth battling five people (43:19 - 43:22)
for that it was not and I know there's (43:20 - 43:24)
there there I know people are about to (43:22 - 43:26)
write in the YouTube comments also hello (43:24 - 43:28)

have to deal with if I want to know that (44:10 - 44:15)
I could ignore 90% of you cuz all you're (44:12 - 44:17)

that I now that I've beaten the game the (45:15 - 45:20)
reason I don't battle them cuz I like (45:18 - 45:21)
Hannah I would like to get rid of that (45:20 - 45:24)
dialogue is because I'm (45:21 - 45:26)
usually carrying around a party that is (45:24 - 45:28)
not fully eveve trained and I don't want (45:26 - 45:30)
to battle them and mess up my EVS (45:28 - 45:32)
because like I don't know what squa (45:30 - 45:34)
ailly is given what whatever it is I (45:32 - 45:36)
don't want it I don't want that it's (45:34 - 45:39)
given rock is what it's (45:36 - 45:41)
given so it's like oh I should battle (45:39 - 45:43)
this person but like oh I recently put (45:41 - 45:46)
like so and so on my team and I don't (45:43 - 45:48)
want to like the the the concept of like (45:46 - 45:51)
I got to stop going to my PC drop off (45:48 - 45:53)
this Pokemon battle you then go back (45:51 - 45:55)
into my PC bring (45:53 - 45:58)
no no thank you for for nothing for no (45:55 - 46:01)
reward for nothing I got four million (45:58 - 46:02)
poked dollars I don't need your 800 (46:01 - 46:04)
poked dollars because I defeated your (46:02 - 46:07)
oink oink I don't know what (46:04 - 46:09)
that I did do the I did do the (46:07 - 46:12)
billionaire storyline using I made so (46:09 - 46:15)
much money off those two because I used (46:12 - 46:20)
the happy hour and amulet coin (46:15 - 46:22)
Strat can you only do that I haven't I (46:20 - 46:23)
haven't started that story line can you (46:22 - 46:25)
only do it once right you only do it (46:23 - 46:28)
once uh and literally if you if you use (46:25 - 46:30)
the happy hour because we all got a (46:28 - 46:32)
happy hour Pokemon if you did the Hui (46:30 - 46:36)
and zor Ark free download it knows happy (46:32 - 46:38)
hour so just put the amlet coin on there (46:36 - 46:41)
do happy hour as the first move then (46:38 - 46:42)
switch to whatever will knock their (46:41 - 46:46)
Pokemon out and it basically quadruples (46:42 - 46:47)
their money look this is how I paid for (46:46 - 46:50)
the flashy outfit and to restore the (46:47 - 46:53)
restore the monument I was like I them (46:50 - 46:55)
for every scent they've got oh (46:53 - 46:59)
absolutely also I am mad that I only get (46:55 - 47:01)
their phone cover and I don't gain (46:59 - 47:04)
access to their hair or their outfits (47:01 - 47:07)
they have different hair yeah they do (47:04 - 47:10)
yeah they do it's bad is it like sorir (47:07 - 47:14)
shird not that bad bad but I'm still mad (47:10 - 47:16)
that I never got swordbert or Shield (47:14 - 47:18)
Bert's hair and I got chairman Rose's (47:16 - 47:20)
hair as an (47:18 - 47:24)
option yeah that was that was weird um (47:20 - 47:25)
so yeah I guess like if you're listening (47:24 - 47:29)
to this podcast uh don't go to Pala and (47:25 - 47:30)
battle the rest of those trainers if you (47:29 - 47:33)
want to see what the end of the not (47:30 - 47:35)
until the end of October then have at it (47:33 - 47:37)
because they're fixing it again I I'm (47:35 - 47:39)
actually being really serious I don't (47:37 - 47:42)
know of anyone who I I know they exist (47:39 - 47:44)
but I don't know of anyone who has (47:42 - 47:47)
battled every single trainer like that (47:44 - 47:50)
that that is like finding the trainers (47:47 - 47:52)
is probably the most timec consuming (47:50 - 47:54)
thing cuz there's no there you have no (47:52 - 47:56)
clue they're like cororo seeds (47:54 - 47:59)
you have no clue what you've already (47:56 - 48:02)
done or not done at that point like even (47:59 - 48:05)
if I was like all right uh tomorrow I'm (48:02 - 48:06)
going to we're going to battle all the (48:05 - 48:10)
trainers to check this box off on a (48:06 - 48:12)
checklist that would matter I don't know (48:10 - 48:14)
where to start I have no clue who I (48:12 - 48:17)
battled or who I haven't batt no clue (48:14 - 48:19)
but I mean there are completionists out (48:17 - 48:22)
there there are completionists for every (48:19 - 48:24)
aspect of everything and I'm sure (48:22 - 48:26)
there's a list and I'm sure some (48:24 - 48:29)
somebody has the list and is absolutely (48:26 - 48:30)
been checking it (48:29 - 48:34)
off yeah I'm trying to go to and pull up (48:30 - 48:35)
where they're all standing but that (48:34 - 48:37)
doesn't answer which ones I've done or (48:35 - 48:38)
which ones I haven't done I'd have to (48:37 - 48:41)
like start go through all of them yeah (48:38 - 48:43)
I'd have to start and like document it (48:41 - 48:45)
myself which again if there if there was (48:43 - 48:47)
a reward if at some point there was like (48:45 - 48:49)
oh if you battled all 300 trainers in (48:47 - 48:51)
Pala actually I think there's like 287 (48:49 - 48:54)
or something if you battled like all 300 (48:51 - 48:58)
you get a (48:54 - 49:00)
uh I don't even know what they would (48:58 - 49:02)
give you another charm of some sort (49:00 - 49:05)
you'd get 10 Citrus (49:02 - 49:08)
berries like I would maybe like if it (49:05 - 49:10)
was a shirt or well there's no shirts in (49:08 - 49:11)
this game if it was like a hat or like (49:10 - 49:14)
shoes or something of like you I think (49:11 - 49:18)
Pokemon needs to do more of that if it (49:14 - 49:20)
was a shirt that I could use I would I (49:18 - 49:22)
would hunt each and every one of them (49:20 - 49:24)
down and make them Ru the day they (49:22 - 49:27)
showed up and to disable your school (49:24 - 49:30)
uniform I would do that I would be so (49:27 - 49:33)
happy to knock out those quab billies (49:30 - 49:35)
every moment of every day would be spent (49:33 - 49:38)
just fighting literally anybody who (49:35 - 49:40)
looked at me sideways in that region (49:38 - 49:43)
let's go I got to change my (49:40 - 49:47)
outfit we are graduating from the school (49:43 - 49:50)
and I'm taking you all down with (49:47 - 49:53)
me I I mean I'm so happy that I'm not in (49:50 - 49:54)
the school outfit and then I'm in the (49:53 - 49:56)
festival outfit like I'm never changing (49:54 - 49:59)
it Festival outfit's good although the (49:56 - 50:01)
DLC outfits that you got which you would (49:59 - 50:03)
have got months ago if you pre-ordered (50:01 - 50:05)
uh they were (50:03 - 50:09)
okay I still like the school uniform but (50:05 - 50:11)
it works for (50:09 - 50:14)
me and the Orange is better than the (50:11 - 50:17)
purple oh I think the orange the I I (50:14 - 50:19)
literally had somebody in my twitch chat (50:17 - 50:21)
that was like I cannot stand the orange (50:19 - 50:24)
and they bought Scarlet because just of (50:21 - 50:26)
the uniform they're like I can't look at (50:24 - 50:30)
it Scarlet's the best game of the two in (50:26 - 50:34)
every way it it except the (50:30 - 50:34)
outfits it does have the better (50:34 - 50:42)
Pokemon uh Pokemon TCG (50:37 - 50:45)
classic go back to the beginning with (50:42 - 50:47)
Pokemon traded card game Classic this (50:45 - 50:49)
Timeless collection includes three 60c (50:47 - 50:51)

foldable two-player game board stackable (51:14 - 51:18)
damage counters and a tool case that (51:16 - 51:20)
keeps everything (51:18 - 51:25)
convenient um now if I told you that you (51:20 - 51:26)
could play with your original base (51:25 - 51:29)
Charizard Venusaur Blastoise three (51:26 - 51:32)
pre-made Decks that are absolutely not (51:29 - 51:35)
tournament legal in any (51:32 - 51:37)
way except for the energy cards they did (51:35 - 51:39)
clarify that the energy cards could be (51:37 - 51:42)
used in your tournament legal deck and I (51:39 - 51:45)
put those in a giant maybe (51:42 - 51:49)
wooden wooden being very generous case (51:45 - 51:51)
and then maybe that case is C covered (51:49 - 51:56)
with maybe a leather or fine woven or (51:51 - 51:59)
plastic I I don't know what the soft (51:56 - 52:02)
material is I did and then I told you (51:59 - 52:04)
that for three decks of 60 cards (52:02 - 52:07)
pre-made not tournament legal ultimately (52:04 - 52:10)
proxy cards that you could pay the low (52:07 - 52:13)
low price of (52:10 - 52:13)
$399.99 is that something that you are (52:16 - 52:22)
in this (52:19 - 52:22)
economy is that something you are (52:22 - 52:29)
willing just spend money (52:25 - 52:29)
on I don't think I've (52:31 - 52:39)
ever felt so priced out from a product (52:33 - 52:42)
before like like the skateboards going (52:39 - 52:45)
back to last week or the week before (52:42 - 52:48)
$109 I I was willing to buy (52:45 - 52:51)
two and still feel (52:48 - 52:54)
very confident okay with that decision I (52:51 - 52:57)
don't know what the word is (52:54 - 53:00)
and and when they went to eBay for 300 (52:57 - 53:03)
plus dollars I was like that's a little (53:00 - 53:06)
bit about of my budget like maybe 150 (53:03 - 53:08)
I'd buy 160 you know a little bit more (53:06 - 53:11)
finders fee I (53:08 - 53:11)
understand are you knocking over my (53:12 - 53:20)
Pikachu um pay attention but (53:14 - 53:24)
$400 for this who is this for and before (53:20 - 53:27)
anyone says like (53:24 - 53:31)
scalpers I I I'm already priced out (53:27 - 53:34)
before the scalpers even got to (53:31 - 53:37)
it the very first commercial the very (53:34 - 53:39)
first trailer they did for this set was (53:37 - 53:42)
very luxury (53:39 - 53:44)
branded and so it's a little confusing (53:42 - 53:46)
why they haven't talked about any luxury (53:44 - 53:49)
materials they don't say what anything (53:46 - 53:52)
is made out of um no they they don't (53:49 - 53:56)
they really don't so I saw this in Japan (53:52 - 54:00)
uh at they they had this at Worlds they (53:56 - 54:04)
had like this this area where you could (54:00 - 54:05)
I I I have a video of it I was going to (54:04 - 54:07)
post like a Tik Tok of like showing (54:05 - 54:09)
everything like closeup and everything I (54:07 - 54:12)
I they were all Japanese who are showing (54:09 - 54:15)
it so we were lucky and we had I was (54:12 - 54:16)
with real breaking Nate it was me and (54:15 - 54:18)
Nate um who saw it (54:16 - 54:21)
together and there are things they don't (54:18 - 54:23)
even mention in (54:21 - 54:26)
this Pokemon Center listing like the (54:23 - 54:28)
little damage counters that they're (54:26 - 54:30)
they're magnetic they magnetize to each (54:28 - 54:32)
other they stack they me they don't (54:30 - 54:36)
mention that at all um the little ball (54:32 - 54:38)
rolling thing is really great like (54:36 - 54:40)
really smooth I'm pretty sure they said (54:38 - 54:43)
that the three deck boxes were leather (54:40 - 54:45)
um and I want to say that the top of the (54:43 - 54:48)
board was like the same material as the (54:45 - 54:51)
deck boxes but now I don't remember but (54:48 - 54:53)
the board is pretty big and they they (54:51 - 54:54)
opened it up and there's like felt on (54:53 - 54:56)
the inside (54:54 - 54:59)
but even even seeing it in person and (54:56 - 55:01)
touching it and now seeing the price (54:59 - 55:04)
like cuz they never said the price it's (55:01 - 55:08)
just so jarring how like I didn't when I (55:04 - 55:09)
was touching it and I was like oh this (55:08 - 55:12)
is cool like you know hey papa pikachu (55:09 - 55:13)
if you're listening if you want to send (55:12 - 55:17)
me one like I'd love to make a bunch of (55:13 - 55:20)
content around it nowhere did I think (55:17 - 55:21)
like oh this is this is probably going (55:20 - 55:23)
to be 4 like I thought in my head like (55:21 - 55:26)
maybe 1999 like maybe 250 at the high (55:23 - 55:29)
end but even 1999 when I say like H it (55:26 - 55:33)
probably be like 200 bucks for what like (55:29 - 55:37)
three leather deck boxes and proxy cards (55:33 - 55:41)
like I feel like really fancy chest sets (55:37 - 55:45)
are usually priced around what this is (55:41 - 55:47)
yeah and that's kind of what this (55:45 - 55:51)
reminds me of this this feels like (55:47 - 55:52)
exactly what magic of the Gathering just (55:51 - 55:54)
did that made everybody so angry with (55:52 - 55:56)
their 30-day (55:54 - 55:57)
with the 30th Anniversary thing where (55:56 - 56:01)
it's like you have a random chance to (55:57 - 56:05)
get proxy cards of famous cards that you (56:01 - 56:08)
cannot use except in your home home game (56:05 - 56:11)
and oh by the way this product's (56:08 - 56:14)
$1,000 I mean you can use most of this (56:11 - 56:17)
set just not the cards you can use the (56:14 - 56:19)
damage counters you can use the you can (56:17 - 56:22)
use all of the all of the things you (56:19 - 56:25)
play the card around it just not the (56:22 - 56:26)
actual (56:25 - 56:27)
so the coolest the coolest part is the (56:26 - 56:29)
little box that has the the damage (56:27 - 56:32)
counters the the poison and burn marker (56:29 - 56:34)
and then the the little circle thing (56:32 - 56:36)
where all you do is you drop the ball in (56:34 - 56:37)
and then it rolls either heads or tails (56:36 - 56:40)
that's it like what what that on its own (56:37 - 56:44)
is what maybe $60 for like retail but (56:40 - 56:46)
realistically probably cost them I mean (56:44 - 56:48)
like I I I don't like using the analogy (56:46 - 56:50)
of like well it's cost an it to cost (56:48 - 56:52)
Apple like $14 to make an iPhone yeah (56:50 - 56:54)
that capitalism understand they're also (56:52 - 56:59)
making it at like like massive scale but (56:54 - 57:01)
like all of those damage counters and (56:59 - 57:05)
the little like ball thingy nowhere in (57:01 - 57:07)
what in what Universe do like little (57:05 - 57:10)
magnetic metal damage counters add up to (57:07 - 57:13)
$60 like you can't make them any more (57:10 - 57:16)
premium like I touched them they're not (57:13 - 57:17)
that pre like they're they're like ah (57:16 - 57:19)
cool like little metal D like I've I've (57:17 - 57:21)
purchased I guarantee you right now Greg (57:19 - 57:24)
has a bunch of metal dice like very (57:21 - 57:27)
fancy like metal six-sided 20-sided 100 (57:24 - 57:31)
sided dice and it's the same material (57:27 - 57:33)
except there's a magnet inside there's (57:31 - 57:35)
no way that that so it's like okay well (57:33 - 57:38)
if the magnet stuff is not that (57:35 - 57:41)
like expensive then it's like okay the (57:38 - 57:45)
game board it it's it's just a piece of (57:41 - 57:48)
wood with a felt like again if they said (57:45 - 57:51)
that it was like genuine alligator (57:48 - 57:52)
leather or something they're not saying (57:51 - 57:53)
that like they're not even saying it's (57:52 - 57:55)
leather at all I don't even I'm not sure (57:53 - 57:57)
sure what the material is like it felt (57:55 - 57:59)
like a (57:57 - 58:03)
soft material like a playmat almost but (57:59 - 58:06)
they're not even saying like oh this (58:03 - 58:07)
is (58:06 - 58:12)
Hermes we partnered with Hermes (58:07 - 58:12)
right like it it just has one hinge on (58:13 - 58:19)
it it's just a box that opens it's it's (58:17 - 58:21)
not even like it's like some complicated (58:19 - 58:24)
mechanism of like ah it opens and then (58:21 - 58:26)
tells your fortune and then and then on (58:24 - 58:29)
top of that you have proxy cards like (58:26 - 58:33)
these are not legal cards so I don't (58:29 - 58:35)
think I could be wrong uh I've been (58:33 - 58:38)
pretty right on a lot of the TCG stuff (58:35 - 58:40)
uh with like the McDonald's stuff in the (58:38 - 58:43)
past and the cards crashing and not (58:40 - 58:45)
being worth nearly as much and how (58:43 - 58:47)
everyone invested in like PSA and now (58:45 - 58:49)
people just have a bunch of slabs that (58:47 - 58:51)
literally no one wants to buy because (58:49 - 58:53)
the (58:51 - 58:53)
pic even if you're like got $400 I'm (58:53 - 58:57)
going to I'm going to drop it because (58:56 - 58:59)
the cards inside are going to be worth (58:57 - 59:02)
more why why would we think the (58:59 - 59:04)
Charizard Venusaur Blastoise would be (59:02 - 59:07)
worth more they're they're they they've (59:04 - 59:09)
already existed these are just reprints (59:07 - 59:12)
that that they have said are not legal (59:09 - 59:16)
in any way so the original (59:12 - 59:18)
Charizard that they've reprinted like (59:16 - 59:21)
six times like B set Bay set 2 XY would (59:18 - 59:27)
still be worth more than this (59:21 - 59:27)
like I I don't understand where this (59:27 - 59:32)
price is coming from and again toah (59:30 - 59:33)
Hannah's point if this is supposed to be (59:32 - 59:35)
like a luxury chest set I understand (59:33 - 59:37)
that but nowhere in your posting are you (59:35 - 59:41)
listing what's luxury about this (59:37 - 59:45)
yeahh also like even if like if if Will (59:41 - 59:47)
bought this and Will was like stepen (59:45 - 59:50)
Greg come on over like I would be like I (59:47 - 59:53)
don't I don't want like I don't want to (59:50 - 59:55)
I the the analogy I used (59:53 - 59:58)
was and Greg knows this really well you (59:55 - 60:01)
go to like the board game store you you (59:58 - 60:02)
buy a brand new board game they're (60:01 - 60:04)
coming out all the time you spend like (60:02 - 60:06)
60 bucks on a brand new board game and (60:04 - 60:08)
then you like open it up you set it up (60:06 - 60:11)
for game night and then somebody (60:08 - 60:13)
somebody there you always have that (60:11 - 60:14)
friend in your friend group that's like (60:13 - 60:17)
really a little bit too hard with their (60:14 - 60:20)
with their holding of the cards and so (60:17 - 60:21)
you just drop 60 bucks in a brand new (60:20 - 60:23)
game and like after your first play (60:21 - 60:24)
session it's like ah this card has a (60:23 - 60:25)
Nick in (60:24 - 60:26)
and it's supposed to be like a (60:25 - 60:28)
randomized hidden roll game so now that (60:26 - 60:29)
kind of defeats the purpose cuz you know (60:28 - 60:32)
there's a Nick this card's bent my dog (60:29 - 60:33)
chewed on this card somebody spilled the (60:32 - 60:36)
drink this card got like I don't I (60:33 - 60:38)
wouldn't want to play the for it's not (60:36 - 60:41)
like if it was for like $400 like you (60:38 - 60:44)
want to play one of my three decks like (60:41 - 60:46)
uh no not really cuz I don't want to be (60:44 - 60:50)
responsible for like we can we can price (60:46 - 60:52)
out a lot of the individual pieces like (60:50 - 60:55)
so looking at the Dex boxes like leather (60:52 - 60:57)
high quality deck boxes of those have (60:55 - 61:00)
existed for a long time and they cost (60:57 - 61:04)
about $12 each so there's three of them (61:00 - 61:07)
which is getting us (61:04 - 61:07)
to you know 36 bucks just for those (61:07 - 61:16)
which is like okay well there's (61:13 - 61:18)
different qualities of leather so again (61:16 - 61:21)
if they were to be like this is the top (61:18 - 61:24)
of the line Lea but I'm looking at like (61:21 - 61:27)
a high and deck box that looks similar (61:24 - 61:29)
to that and they're 12 bucks each but (61:27 - 61:31)
even then even if you take those bits (61:29 - 61:33)
and then you say okay well okay let's (61:31 - 61:35)
say like the magnetic counters if you (61:33 - 61:37)
bought them separately with that would (61:35 - 61:40)
be another $40 let's (61:37 - 61:43)
say you are still not anywhere (61:40 - 61:46)
approaching B if you bought those pieces (61:43 - 61:49)
individual at at full retail price right (61:46 - 61:51)
now you are not approaching $400 for (61:49 - 61:56)
everything not even close (61:51 - 61:56)
I just want to say that these are on (61:57 - 62:01)
eBay for buy it now for like $800 and (61:58 - 62:03)
they're not going anywhere there is a (62:01 - 62:05)
starting bid at (62:03 - 62:08)
$500 no buy with a buy at now of a th000 (62:05 - 62:11)
also no bids no (62:08 - 62:14)
bids again I I don't think this is like (62:11 - 62:17)
a scalping like I don't think this is a (62:14 - 62:19)
scalping issue I think people bought it (62:17 - 62:22)
with the intent to scalp it of course (62:19 - 62:25)
but I I think that people are are (62:22 - 62:28)
already priced out like myself included (62:25 - 62:29)
like as somebody who collects Pokemon (62:28 - 62:32)
stuff I collect a $100 metal pokeballs I (62:29 - 62:35)
have them all they're behind me and I (62:32 - 62:37)
love them and they have never sold out (62:35 - 62:39)
except for the master ball sold out in (62:37 - 62:41)
like two hours I think the love ball is (62:39 - 62:43)
sold out because it was around (62:41 - 62:44)
Valentine's Day that was really good (62:43 - 62:46)
marketing and then they restocked it (62:44 - 62:48)
they're $100 each sometimes they go on (62:46 - 62:50)
sale at like GameStop for like 80 bucks (62:48 - 62:51)
sometimes even cheaper for like Black (62:50 - 62:54)
Friday like I like them I think they're (62:51 - 62:56)
great they they feel great in the hands (62:54 - 62:58)
they're metal um they light up I've (62:56 - 63:00)
never replaced the batteries in any of (62:58 - 63:02)
them because why would I like light them (63:00 - 63:04)
up they do not they just the somebody (63:02 - 63:06)
comes they don't do anything they light (63:04 - 63:09)
up they're cool I understand the process (63:06 - 63:10)
of like I want to collect something and (63:09 - 63:12)
put on my shelf I have a lot of Pokemon (63:10 - 63:14)
plushes they also don't do anything I (63:12 - 63:16)
got two bear Walker skateboards also (63:14 - 63:18)
don't do anything like I got a lot of (63:16 - 63:20)
Pokemon stuff that doesn't do anything (63:18 - 63:22)
oh that I (63:20 - 63:28)
did I I this this product is just I mean (63:22 - 63:30)
it's sold out so but (63:28 - 63:33)
iers are going to try to not lose money (63:30 - 63:35)
I mean it's interesting that they sold (63:33 - 63:36)
out but like if you go to other places (63:35 - 63:38)
that normally car it like Best Buy still (63:36 - 63:40)
has it listed as coming soon so the (63:38 - 63:42)
question is is like have stores gotten (63:40 - 63:44)
their stock yet and what's going to (63:42 - 63:47)
happen in actual stores will they sell (63:44 - 63:49)
out or will this be a thing come Black (63:47 - 63:50)
Friday where you're like you know that (63:49 - 63:55)
$400 product it's now 150 on clear at (63:50 - 63:57)
Best Buy so I'm going to pick it up like (63:55 - 63:59)
it's hard to (63:57 - 64:02)
say what exactly is happening with this (63:59 - 64:06)
set CU it is grossly overpriced at $400 (64:02 - 64:10)
like obnoxiously overpriced even at 250 (64:06 - 64:12)
I would have been like I'm not sure if (64:10 - 64:14)
I'm going to get it yeah I mean I think (64:12 - 64:16)
250 (64:14 - 64:21)
is is a very (64:16 - 64:21)
high-end collectible item that at least (64:21 - 64:26)
their pictures would lead you to believe (64:25 - 64:29)
that the quality might be worth $250 but (64:26 - 64:31)
you would still be on the fence looking (64:29 - 64:33)
at the pictures and knowing that it's (64:31 - 64:35)
proxies and knowing how much the base (64:33 - 64:38)
things cost separately $400 is like a (64:35 - 64:42)
hard not you've got to be kidding me for (64:38 - 64:45)
for what for (64:42 - 64:48)
what they've also marketed things as (64:45 - 64:51)
luxury much better than they've marketed (64:48 - 64:55)
this D the pictures are not (64:51 - 64:59)
Christmas tree isn't even ceramic it's (64:55 - 64:59)
resin (65:00 - 65:03)
I yeah I (65:03 - 65:09)
mean I think the only thing I want from (65:06 - 65:10)
this is like the damage counters I think (65:09 - 65:12)
the damage counters are really cool I (65:10 - 65:13)
think the damage counters are cool I (65:12 - 65:15)
think they're really cool and you can (65:13 - 65:18)
actually like bring like I am sure that (65:15 - 65:20)
when this product comes out which is (65:18 - 65:23)
November on their website that there (65:20 - 65:26)
there will be a video on Twitter of (65:23 - 65:28)
somebody carrying their giant briefcase (65:26 - 65:31)
to their Like official match and then (65:28 - 65:33)
like opening it up and taking out their (65:31 - 65:36)
like Mew EX deck or whatever is like (65:33 - 65:40)
good I'm I'm sure that video will (65:36 - 65:40)
exist maybe don't be that person I guess (65:40 - 65:47)
like don't bring your giant wooden $400 (65:44 - 65:50)
classic to what do whatever you want (65:47 - 65:52)
although I do think like the damage (65:50 - 65:54)
counters is something that you could (65:52 - 65:56)
easily bring to a tournament mhm they're (65:54 - 65:58)
they're it's really small uh (65:56 - 66:02)
I disclosure though I don't know if this (65:58 - 66:03)
is tournament legal I don't know I don't (66:02 - 66:05)
think this is tournament legal so like (66:03 - 66:08)
you could like you could still use the (66:05 - 66:10)
damage counters you could still use the (66:08 - 66:12)
markers but I don't know if dropping the (66:10 - 66:14)
little ball on the little round spinny (66:12 - 66:16)
thing I don't know if that's going to (66:14 - 66:17)
that has to be in the rules of that if (66:16 - 66:19)
that's allowed or not because currently (66:17 - 66:21)
in the rules right now it is only you're (66:19 - 66:24)
allowed to flip a coin heads or tails um (66:21 - 66:25)
and they're pretty strict about what (66:24 - 66:27)
coins you can (66:25 - 66:29)
use uh you could easily get a judge (66:27 - 66:31)
called on you that so and so doesn't (66:29 - 66:32)
like your (66:31 - 66:35)
coin um and then the judge might bring (66:32 - 66:37)
their own coin and then the other thing (66:35 - 66:39)
you can do is you can roll a die and if (66:37 - 66:42)
it's odd or even is heads or tails for (66:39 - 66:44)
the Dy but the Dy rules are really (66:42 - 66:46)
specific too like the Dy usually has to (66:44 - 66:49)
be like semi-translucent it must have (66:46 - 66:52)
like rounded edges like the rules for (66:49 - 66:53)
what you are allowed to flip for heads (66:52 - 66:55)
or tails are are pretty strict and I (66:53 - 66:57)
don't think anywhere in the rules it's (66:55 - 66:58)
saying you can (66:57 - 67:03)
bring the the roller coaster ramp to (66:58 - 67:05)
drop your little metal ball down like I (67:03 - 67:07)
I don't even think that's allowed I'm (67:05 - 67:09)
sure somebody will try it and a judge (67:07 - 67:14)
will be called um I always loved it that (67:09 - 67:17)
I had the Like official Pokemon dice (67:14 - 67:19)
dice that you got from Japan so the (67:17 - 67:21)
heads was a Pikachu heads and then the (67:19 - 67:22)
tail was a Pikachu tail and they had (67:21 - 67:25)
little like Japanese I can't read it but (67:22 - 67:27)
you know little Japanese on it and I (67:25 - 67:29)
would bring that to tournaments and when (67:27 - 67:32)
somebody was losing against me they (67:29 - 67:34)
would call the judge every this happened (67:32 - 67:36)
every single time I they would be losing (67:34 - 67:39)
and they would be so what happens in TCG (67:36 - 67:40)
I've talked about this before but what (67:39 - 67:41)
happens in TCG is when when somebody's (67:40 - 67:43)
losing and they're really Petty they (67:41 - 67:45)
will look for anything they can and (67:43 - 67:47)
you're doing to like call a judge to try (67:45 - 67:49)
to get some kind of advantage to like (67:47 - 67:51)
halt the game in in their way so they (67:49 - 67:53)
would always call my D they would always (67:51 - 67:55)
be like judge (67:53 - 67:57)
I don't think these dice are legal he (67:55 - 67:59)
got heads at least once in (67:57 - 68:01)
the but the judge would always come over (67:59 - 68:03)
and be like these are official Pokemon (68:01 - 68:05)
dice they're just they're just imported (68:03 - 68:07)
from Japan like the dice are fine but (68:05 - 68:09)
they would always every single time (68:07 - 68:11)
they'd be like judge this dice has a (68:09 - 68:14)
Pikachu on it I've never seen it (68:11 - 68:14)
before um yeah but I I don't know if (68:16 - 68:21)
this little ball rolling thing is going (68:19 - 68:24)
to be legal I I feel like no I feel like (68:21 - 68:28)
the ball rolling thing is really easy to (68:24 - 68:30)
manipulate yeah cuz wouldn't (68:28 - 68:33)
you if it was like weighted towards one (68:30 - 68:35)
side right yeah I feel like it's really (68:33 - 68:37)
easy like you'd also have to trust like (68:35 - 68:40)
the person did SL like slide two cards (68:37 - 68:41)
under it so it would always or also have (68:40 - 68:45)
a magnet under the heads part so that (68:41 - 68:47)
the ball's attracted to it like that (68:45 - 68:49)
just seems ripe (68:47 - 68:52)
with cheat all over it like I highly (68:49 - 68:53)
doubt they're going to allow like the (68:52 - 68:55)
damage count I think you can use cuz (68:53 - 68:57)
that doesn't do anything right it's just (68:55 - 68:58)
yeah you can use dice you can use the (68:57 - 69:01)
little gem but I I do think everything (68:58 - 69:04)
else in here it creates apart from the (69:01 - 69:07)
deck boxes creates a problem like you (69:04 - 69:08)
can bring the fancy deck boxes but again (69:07 - 69:11)
you can buy them cheaper (69:08 - 69:13)
elsewhere again Pokemon if you're (69:11 - 69:14)
listening I would love to be proven (69:13 - 69:17)
wrong feel free to send me the $400 (69:14 - 69:20)
product I would love to report back that (69:17 - 69:25)
this is a genuine highquality leather um (69:20 - 69:27)
I will say I am very tempted by the (69:25 - 69:30)
holiday calendar Pokemon TCG box that I (69:27 - 69:32)
have seen all over Target this year I (69:30 - 69:36)
have it on my other desk it's wonderful (69:32 - 69:38)
I got it last year it is a delight to (69:36 - 69:40)
open every day of that of that holiday (69:38 - 69:44)
season I may have to get it if I get a (69:40 - 69:46)
job I am also tempted there's a website (69:44 - 69:48)
that I found on Amazon there was this (69:46 - 69:51)
maker that made Advent calendars of (69:48 - 69:55)
knockoff Pokemon toys and they were so (69:51 - 69:58)
funny and the thing was like $11 and I (69:55 - 70:02)
was looking at it I'm like do I spend (69:58 - 70:07)
$111 to have mutant Pokemon figures I (70:02 - 70:10)
Nick was very much bu it and I was like (70:07 - 70:12)
I just don't think I'm G to spend that (70:10 - 70:15)
money uh I may I may break down and do (70:12 - 70:17)
it this year because they were hilarious (70:15 - 70:19)
they look the pictures look (70:17 - 70:22)
hilarious and the the Halloween Pokemon (70:19 - 70:24)
Advent calendar is an actual off IAL (70:22 - 70:27)
thing although I will debate anyone who (70:24 - 70:31)
says it's an advent calendar yeah Advent (70:27 - 70:33)
advent's kind of specific for multiple (70:31 - 70:37)
reasons but also there are only 13 days (70:33 - 70:39)
on the Halloween calendar spooky yeah I (70:37 - 70:43)
mean 13 is the Halloween number it's not (70:39 - 70:46)
though it is you want it to be like1 is (70:43 - 70:49)
the Halloween yeah I want it to be the (70:46 - 70:51)
number of days in the month reverse it (70:49 - 70:54)
you get 13 13 is an unlucky number (70:51 - 70:56)
that's why no hotels in the entire world (70:54 - 70:58)
have a 13th (70:56 - 70:58)
floor uh so Pokémon Go News will wrap up (70:59 - 71:06)
with is there's an auro hatch day um on (71:02 - 71:08)
Saturday September 30th from 2: to 5: (71:06 - 71:10)
this is pretty similar to the Riolu (71:08 - 71:13)
hatch day that they did um if you're (71:10 - 71:16)
lucky you will get a what what did they (71:13 - 71:18)
what did people speculate was rolu like (71:16 - 71:23)
1 in 10 it was like pretty high um it (71:18 - 71:25)
was pretty high was much more exciting (71:23 - 71:28)
though (71:25 - 71:33)
yeah your faces Earl nobody likes you uh (71:28 - 71:37)
aeril is good is is very good in PvP so (71:33 - 71:39)
if you don't have a good one of those (71:37 - 71:41)
this is a good option for (71:39 - 71:44)
that the hatch events are interesting (71:41 - 71:46)
there will be event exclusive time (71:44 - 71:49)
research with a super incubator at no (71:46 - 71:53)
cost nitic being generous for us um (71:49 - 71:55)
please note that the the time research (71:53 - 71:57)
will expire you'll have to claim it (71:55 - 71:59)
before 5:00 p.m. local time on Saturday (71:57 - 72:01)
so I can't remember what it was for (71:59 - 72:02)
Riolo wasn't it like just hash one egg (72:01 - 72:04)
and then you get like a free incubator (72:02 - 72:07)
or something like that I think so um so (72:04 - 72:10)
pretty similar here and then uh the the (72:07 - 72:13)
big thing that nitic announced was uh (72:10 - 72:15)
this was just like three days ago they (72:13 - 72:17)
announced this adventure awaits during (72:15 - 72:20)
the out toplay event trainers get ready (72:17 - 72:23)

lucky an (72:56 - 73:00)
Arcanine all of those can be shiny (72:57 - 73:01)
except Arcanine and (73:00 - 73:05)
paly uh huan Growlithe will be in 2K (73:01 - 73:09)
eggs and 7K eggs they will be able to be (73:05 - 73:11)
hatched kleon will appear more (73:09 - 73:13)
frequently at Poké stops I think if (73:11 - 73:15)
there's any takeaway from all of this (73:13 - 73:18)
it's that kleon will be appearing (73:15 - 73:21)
more um (73:18 - 73:24)
yep three times the X (73:21 - 73:27)
3x XP for completing a route I didn't (73:24 - 73:29)
even know you got XP for completing a (73:27 - 73:32)
route uh earn buddy Candy faster when (73:29 - 73:34)
exploring a route field research will (73:32 - 73:36)
include Growlithe so you don't need to (73:34 - 73:39)
completely rely on eggs huan Growlithe (73:36 - 73:42)

this the first time they've done $2 it's (73:54 - 73:58)
always been one right I think they've (73:56 - 74:00)
upped it I don't know this is a good one (73:58 - 74:02)
though actually the value on this one is (74:00 - 74:05)
way better than the pomy so for (74:02 - 74:09)
$2 I did buy the pomi backpack after it (74:05 - 74:11)
was already in the shop for 250 coins (74:09 - 74:14)
which was half the five I already had (74:11 - 74:16)

want to remind everyone that the $5 (74:31 - 74:36)
pommy research was a backpack that your (74:33 - 74:38)
trainer could wear and two encounters (74:36 - 74:39)
with (74:38 - 74:43)
pommy even though pomy was literally (74:39 - 74:47)
everywhere uh for $5 (74:43 - 74:50)
um trainers can purchase the gift gift (74:47 - 74:52)
the ticket purchase the gift ticket blah (74:50 - 74:54)
blah blah uh your time to research will (74:52 - 74:57)
expire like always um there will be a (74:54 - 74:59)
voyager box there will be an ultra hatch (74:57 - 75:01)

showcases for growth and huian Growlithe (75:01 - 75:06)
there will be a George Washington wig (75:04 - 75:08)
added to the Avatar Store so (75:06 - 75:11)
weird um and they (75:08 - 75:14)
will they they have they're fixing (75:11 - 75:15)
routes they're fixing the brand new (75:14 - 75:16)
thing that they released that was (75:15 - 75:18)
already broken to begin with this is (75:16 - 75:20)
what they're saying that is going to be (75:18 - 75:22)
fixed increased route availability (75:20 - 75:25)
across the globe lower requirement for (75:22 - 75:26)
trainers to create a route I don't think (75:25 - 75:29)
that's a good thing uh several quality (75:26 - 75:30)
of life improvements including more (75:29 - 75:33)
routes listed on the nearby menu (75:30 - 75:35)
directional arrows for routes and (75:33 - 75:38)
running count of Zygarde cells you've (75:35 - 75:40)
collected in the cube (75:38 - 75:43)
details in the future trainers can (75:40 - 75:46)
expect more routes popping up around the (75:43 - 75:50)
world uh with the more changes with more (75:46 - 75:52)
trainers able to create routes trainers (75:50 - 75:55)
will be able to find zygard s more often (75:52 - 75:56)
a notification available to trainers (75:55 - 75:59)
when routes are nearby and various (75:56 - 76:02)
quality of life (75:59 - 76:02)
improvements how's your how's your route (76:03 - 76:08)
going Hannah did you go back to the (76:06 - 76:11)
woods and submit your route again I have (76:08 - 76:14)
not that is a long Trek but I did submit (76:11 - 76:17)
another one uh two months ago more than (76:14 - 76:19)
two months ago that has been under (76:17 - 76:21)
review the entire (76:19 - 76:25)
time so I think both of mine have been (76:21 - 76:26)
under review the entire time as well I (76:25 - 76:28)
made one with Greg back for some (76:26 - 76:30)
Community today we (76:28 - 76:34)
did and that is still underw I think it (76:30 - 76:36)
Poliwag yeah that was that that was the (76:34 - 76:39)
Stone Arch one didn't we do yeah yeah (76:36 - 76:40)
which that route's going to be pretty (76:39 - 76:42)
useless because they're going to close (76:40 - 76:45)
star arch bridge in the next couple (76:42 - 76:48)
months and that route will you cannot (76:45 - 76:49)
take that route because the route I made (76:48 - 76:51)
was across the bridge that they are (76:49 - 76:54)
closing to for construction to like redo (76:51 - 76:59)
it um but it hasn't gotten approved (76:54 - 76:59)
yet yeah I mean just walk around (76:59 - 77:04)
Centennial Lakes and make RS like (77:01 - 77:06)
everybody else did but this is one of (77:04 - 77:09)
the problems with routes uh and this is (77:06 - 77:10)
maybe an opposite problem that some (77:09 - 77:12)
people have I think the problem that (77:10 - 77:14)
people have are there's no routes by me (77:12 - 77:16)
I have the opposite problem I go to Mall (77:14 - 77:17)
of America and I open up routes and (77:16 - 77:20)
there's like 18 routes and they're all (77:17 - 77:22)
the same it's all walk in a circle (77:20 - 77:25)
around mountain of around ball and I (77:22 - 77:28)
I there's like really no way to compare (77:25 - 77:31)
them they're like I guess this person (77:28 - 77:33)
took this one 100 times and this person (77:31 - 77:34)
took this one 90 times maybe the 100 (77:33 - 77:36)
times one is (77:34 - 77:40)
better like that's not a good solution (77:36 - 77:41)
either like having more people create (77:40 - 77:43)
more routes ultimately is good but when (77:41 - 77:45)
everyone's just creating the same route (77:43 - 77:47)
of a walk in a circle around I don't (77:45 - 77:50)
need 14 of them somebody it's like when (77:47 - 77:51)
I go to my YouTube comments and (77:50 - 77:53)
everyone's commenting did you guys not (77:51 - 77:55)
see everyone else is somebody already (77:53 - 77:57)
said this 30 (77:55 - 78:00)
times you're saying the same thing like (77:57 - 78:01)
when you're create when you went to M (78:00 - 78:03)
America did you not check oh somebody (78:01 - 78:06)
already created a circle 18 other times (78:03 - 78:08)
maybe I'll create a circle too like why (78:06 - 78:10)
did we possible they all made them at (78:08 - 78:12)
the same time before any of them had (78:10 - 78:15)
been approved that's always possible I (78:12 - 78:17)
think that the route that I created now (78:15 - 78:20)
has a route in that same place uh not (78:17 - 78:22)
the Fun Forest one the other (78:20 - 78:27)
one they're just the approval process is (78:22 - 78:29)
this whole feature this whole feature is (78:27 - 78:33)
questionable in in its roll out it's (78:29 - 78:36)
it's like on paper it's cool yeah to be (78:33 - 78:41)
like I like the idea of it I want like I (78:36 - 78:43)
remember the Zoe 2 dos video of her (78:41 - 78:46)
finding like a 20 kilometer route and (78:43 - 78:48)
she's like I'm going to do this and then (78:46 - 78:51)
it took her like how long to do like (78:48 - 78:53)
forever to do the whole day the the (78:51 - 78:56)
whole day and then it was probably done (78:53 - 78:59)
with a third party not actual tool (78:56 - 79:00)
because multiple times the route goes (78:59 - 79:02)
across like rivers and stuff and like (79:00 - 79:04)
Zoe gets there and there's like there's (79:02 - 79:08)
literally no way to cross um and but (79:04 - 79:10)
like the concept of like for me when I (79:08 - 79:12)
was watching that was like oh like going (79:10 - 79:15)
to Japan opening up the app being like (79:12 - 79:16)
Oh there's a route here that takes me (79:15 - 79:18)
past like five different shrines cuz (79:16 - 79:20)
there's like shrines hidden everywhere (79:18 - 79:23)
in Japan and like I probably walked by (79:20 - 79:25)
passed a bunch that I was like oh if I (79:23 - 79:28)
knew that was there I would have like (79:25 - 79:32)
stopped but no one's making good this (79:28 - 79:33)
the problem with the app is no one's (79:32 - 79:36)
making good routes yeah good routes (79:33 - 79:38)
could be really good and I think that (79:36 - 79:40)
it's a good feature to add more spawn (79:38 - 79:43)
points and things to do in places that (79:40 - 79:46)
don't have very many poké stops or spawn (79:43 - 79:48)
points but when things aren't getting (79:46 - 79:50)
approved or when the things that are (79:48 - 79:55)
getting approved are not good routes (79:50 - 79:55)
yeah so there is a there is a route in (79:55 - 80:02)
my neighborhood that somebody built that (79:59 - 80:05)
literally is start at One (80:02 - 80:09)
Park walk down a random street that has (80:05 - 80:13)
nothing on it to another Park and end in (80:09 - 80:16)
that Park and I'm like how how did this (80:13 - 80:18)
get (80:16 - 80:21)
approved I mean it's not exactly I mean (80:18 - 80:23)
that's not the worst I've heard yeah but (80:21 - 80:27)
it walks it walks down it literally (80:23 - 80:29)
looks like it's walking down Johnson (80:27 - 80:31)
Street which is a busy (80:29 - 80:35)
street like there sidewalks but (80:31 - 80:37)
like here here's a here's here's a (80:35 - 80:39)
better thing Greg I don't know how this (80:37 - 80:41)
got approved so fast but when I was in (80:39 - 80:43)
Japan I stayed at whatever hotel that (80:41 - 80:46)
the Pokemon company put me in the the (80:43 - 80:49)
something Resort it was a Hawaiian (80:46 - 80:51)
themed hotel funny enough they announced (80:49 - 80:53)
Hawaii is the next place um but so the (80:51 - 80:56)
hotel was connected to the convention (80:53 - 80:59)
center and then there was three (80:56 - 81:01)
convention centers four Worlds the first (80:59 - 81:03)
Convention Center was like the Pokemon (81:01 - 81:06)
Center the second Convention Center was (81:03 - 81:07)
the the tournament and then the third (81:06 - 81:10)
one was like where the TCG live was and (81:07 - 81:12)
somebody (81:10 - 81:15)
because because our hotel had the 10 (81:12 - 81:17)
like featured content creators just (81:15 - 81:18)
disclosing I was one of the 10 I did not (81:17 - 81:21)
pay for the hotel Pikachu did that they (81:18 - 81:24)
would tell all the other people who like (81:21 - 81:25)
paid their own way to like meet in front (81:24 - 81:28)
of that hotel for things so there was (81:25 - 81:30)
like probably like 30 content creators (81:28 - 81:31)
total but like 10 of them were staying (81:30 - 81:36)
in the hotel somebody created a route (81:31 - 81:39)
from that hotel spot to the Pokemon (81:36 - 81:43)
Center which was maybe a thre minute (81:39 - 81:45)
route it was like a it was like (81:43 - 81:47)
literally the shortest route you could (81:45 - 81:51)
make that was allowed cuz like you have (81:47 - 81:53)
to have like a certain distance before (81:51 - 81:55)
like you could submit it and so it was (81:53 - 81:57)
literally 30 content creators that would (81:55 - 81:59)
be like all right let's all start the (81:57 - 82:01)
route and then they would walk it and (81:59 - 82:02)
then it would be over in 3 minutes and I (82:01 - 82:05)
got a zygard cell almost every time from (82:02 - 82:07)
that I got like super lucky and I would (82:05 - 82:09)
just do it every like morning like it (82:07 - 82:12)
was like what four Mornings in a row and (82:09 - 82:14)
that was it and I I have no clue how (82:12 - 82:16)
that got approved oh yeah obviously a (82:14 - 82:18)
bunch of people were taking it because (82:16 - 82:19)
everyone was like Hey I'm starting this (82:18 - 82:20)
route and then people would be like oh (82:19 - 82:22)
there's a route here and then like that (82:20 - 82:23)
was what I did first day I was like oh (82:22 - 82:26)
there's a route here cool and I was like (82:23 - 82:28)
oh it's it's literally just like walk (82:26 - 82:31)
one block over and then up some stairs (82:28 - 82:33)
and then it's done cool I got a zygard (82:31 - 82:36)
cell that's cool but like's I know how (82:33 - 82:38)
that got approved so fast there's (82:36 - 82:39)
another route in my neighborhood that's (82:38 - 82:41)
literally the park is Tiny like it is (82:39 - 82:43)
not a huge Park it's literally the route (82:41 - 82:46)
I just looked at it start at the (82:43 - 82:50)
tennis courts loop around the swimming (82:46 - 82:53)
pool go to the side (82:50 - 82:55)
and I'm (82:53 - 82:59)
like I guess but like there's nothing in (82:55 - 83:02)
that Park I mean it's a night I mean (82:59 - 83:04)
it's a it's an open Park and it's it's (83:02 - 83:07)
fine but like (83:04 - 83:12)
how I don't understand the approval (83:07 - 83:16)
process for any of this just as a rule I (83:12 - 83:18)
don't understand it and then how you're (83:16 - 83:21)
supposed to find them also like I just (83:18 - 83:23)
opened it up and I'm like (83:21 - 83:25)
none of this makes first of all the (83:23 - 83:28)
Windam park route which is there I'm (83:25 - 83:31)
like only people who live in this (83:28 - 83:33)
neighborhood have any idea where those (83:31 - 83:34)
two places (83:33 - 83:36)
are because there's no Landmark like you (83:34 - 83:38)
are literally starting at somebody's (83:36 - 83:40)
random house and then walking down a (83:38 - 83:43)
busy street you your to start in front (83:40 - 83:45)
of your neighbor's house Greg yeah I (83:43 - 83:46)
mean I might as well I'll just say like (83:45 - 83:48)
hey come see the Buddhist temple at the (83:46 - 83:50)
end of my Street start at my house go (83:48 - 83:52)
see the Buddhists go around the corner (83:50 - 83:53)
and come back (83:52 - 83:56)
why it's interesting as walking down a (83:53 - 84:00)
literally busy residential street to a (83:56 - 84:04)
park I think routes are really cool on (84:00 - 84:08)
paper and I think if I was like (84:04 - 84:10)
exploring a city for the first time I (84:08 - 84:12)
would like a route to take me to like (84:10 - 84:16)
the ideal sightseeing places there they (84:12 - 84:17)
were there was an app back in the day (84:16 - 84:21)
gosh I feel so old um that was called (84:17 - 84:23)
Gala and it was (84:21 - 84:26)
Craig do you know this app I do but it's (84:23 - 84:30)
not that long ago but but there it was (84:26 - 84:33)
goala was like a location based app that (84:30 - 84:34)
was like four (84:33 - 84:37)
square and so I I had to live in (84:34 - 84:39)
California for like a month cuz I was (84:37 - 84:43)
working at Apple um and when I was there (84:39 - 84:44)
I was using goala and I was using for (84:43 - 84:50)
square to find places to go um and goala (84:44 - 84:54)
was really good uh for like ultimately (84:50 - 84:57)
what this is which was a route so goala (84:54 - 84:59)
had like a route in San Francisco that (84:57 - 85:03)
was like start on this like boardwalk (84:59 - 85:04)
and then walk over to this Lighthouse (85:03 - 85:06)
and then walk over to like this beach (85:04 - 85:09)
and then to walk over to this other (85:06 - 85:12)
statue on the beach like it was like (85:09 - 85:14)
seven tourist things and then it told (85:12 - 85:16)
you that like this was going to be like (85:14 - 85:19)
45 minutes and it would tell you like (85:16 - 85:21)
which way to go and when you completed (85:19 - 85:22)
it you got like a little medal in your (85:21 - 85:24)
goala app that you completed like this (85:22 - 85:26)
specific but they were like official (85:24 - 85:30)
routes made by goala I'm sure there were (85:26 - 85:31)
maybe some Community things and then (85:30 - 85:33)
there was another route in California (85:31 - 85:36)
that was like it was like an hour and a (85:33 - 85:37)
half away it was supposed to be like a (85:36 - 85:39)
spooky route it was like this very small (85:37 - 85:42)
City and it had like um like a haunted (85:39 - 85:45)
house or like this really historic thing (85:42 - 85:47)
that apparently somebody got murdered in (85:45 - 85:49)
and then like this Bookshop it was like (85:47 - 85:51)
all like again it was like five things (85:49 - 85:53)
and I went out there and I did that that (85:51 - 85:55)
um CU I had a car and I had weekends off (85:53 - 85:56)
and I was like I don't know what else (85:55 - 85:58)
like I have no friends out here so I (85:56 - 86:00)
went I drove like the hour and a half I (85:58 - 86:02)
the city was really cool it was like a (86:00 - 86:05)
really tiny town that like probably (86:02 - 86:07)
would be in a horror movie and so I like (86:05 - 86:09)
did that little thing and that was a (86:07 - 86:11)
great experience that doesn't exist in (86:09 - 86:14)
Pogo like realistically Niantic should (86:11 - 86:16)
throw all of these Community routes out (86:14 - 86:21)
and then have like this is the New York (86:16 - 86:22)
thing this is the Boston thing this is (86:21 - 86:24)
is the Austin Texas thing like there (86:22 - 86:28)
needs to be at least some cure rated (86:24 - 86:31)
routes that people can go to that City (86:28 - 86:33)
and have a good experience because no (86:31 - 86:35)
one's having a good experience driving (86:33 - 86:37)
out to wherever Greg lives in (86:35 - 86:39)
Minneapolis and walking around his (86:37 - 86:40)
tennis court no one wants that (86:39 - 86:43)
experience not even the people in Greg's (86:40 - 86:46)
neighborhood wants that experience (86:43 - 86:48)
nope (86:46 - 86:54)
that's okay goala was 2007 to 2012 (86:48 - 86:54)
I didn't realize they also tried to (86:55 - 87:00)
relaunch in March of this year did they (86:57 - 87:03)
really yeah wild and I mean other apps (87:00 - 87:05)
like that exist apparently it failed (87:03 - 87:07)
because they ceased production a month (87:05 - 87:12)
later so the 2023 relaunch did not go (87:07 - 87:14)
where well for (87:12 - 87:16)
guala I've definitely seen apps like (87:14 - 87:18)
that pop up here and there and there are (87:16 - 87:20)
hiking trails apps like that and I feel (87:18 - 87:23)
like the routes would do great (87:20 - 87:25)
with that kind of thing I I think there (87:23 - 87:29)
are a lot of existing like hiking trails (87:25 - 87:32)
there are a lot of existing historical (87:29 - 87:34)
things that Niantic could have worked (87:32 - 87:38)
with to have very wellmade well (87:34 - 87:41)
established interesting routes to launch (87:38 - 87:43)
their product with instead they have (87:41 - 87:45)
relied (87:43 - 87:49)
on a community that is just like well (87:45 - 87:51)
you've tied a reward to this so I'm (87:49 - 87:54)
going to try to make a very simple route (87:51 - 87:56)
to reap the reward from it I'm going to (87:54 - 87:58)
try to game the system which is how you (87:56 - 87:59)
end up with (87:58 - 88:02)
15 Mall of America Circle routes which (87:59 - 88:04)
is I'm assuming the person that made (88:02 - 88:06)
your tennis court is a hardcore player (88:04 - 88:08)
that walks that tennis court every day (88:06 - 88:10)
because they want the zygard cube but (88:08 - 88:12)
that doesn't benefit anyone but that (88:10 - 88:14)
person yeah so you're you have this (88:12 - 88:17)
situation where you have you there even (88:14 - 88:18)
in this press release they're like we're (88:17 - 88:20)
lowering the requirements the only thing (88:18 - 88:22)
that that's going to do is get more (88:20 - 88:23)
useless routes and it's going to back up (88:22 - 88:24)
the rout I don't know how many people (88:23 - 88:26)
are approving it I think it's the people (88:24 - 88:28)
who approve Wayfair or stuff like that (88:26 - 88:31)
all it's going to do is slow down (88:28 - 88:33)
everyone's process of actually getting (88:31 - 88:35)
good routes like if anything you're (88:33 - 88:36)
going to lower the requirement there's (88:35 - 88:37)
going to be 20 more Mall of America (88:36 - 88:39)
circles that like people are just going (88:37 - 88:42)
to submit because they're like I want to (88:39 - 88:43)
submit a route I'm going to submit this (88:42 - 88:46)
one like no we don't need that anymore (88:43 - 88:47)
we we're spinning in circles enough at (88:46 - 88:49)
mall America I was just there yesterday (88:47 - 88:53)
it was very busy and gross (88:49 - 88:54)
I don't know why so many people were at (88:53 - 88:57)
M America it was not the place to (88:54 - 88:57)
be (88:58 - 89:03)
um yeah again I don't want to be like (89:00 - 89:06)
routs are dumb or silly I think they're (89:03 - 89:09)
very cool I just think they are so (89:06 - 89:11)
poorly executed right (89:09 - 89:14)
now that they should they should have (89:11 - 89:17)
rolled it out without the zygard (89:14 - 89:19)
thing they should have rolled it out as (89:17 - 89:21)
like this is something we're trying at (89:19 - 89:23)
the very end you get I don't know an (89:21 - 89:25)
incubator or something like they (89:23 - 89:26)
shouldn't have tied it to a brand new (89:25 - 89:28)
Pokemon that people just want to set up (89:26 - 89:30)
a route to try to gamify it to get the (89:28 - 89:33)
brand new Pokemon yeah and research (89:30 - 89:35)
rewards because you still need to do it (89:33 - 89:38)
to finish that research and also I don't (89:35 - 89:41)
Niantic has so much weight and so much (89:38 - 89:43)
power and I don't know if it's because (89:41 - 89:44)
the Pokemon company but I don't get why (89:43 - 89:48)
Niantic can't go to Four Square or some (89:44 - 89:51)
other app and be like hey let's partner (89:48 - 89:54)
together we'll put (89:51 - 89:57)
your I don't know like put your little (89:54 - 89:58)
we'll put you in one of those little (89:57 - 90:00)
balloons so when like people tap on the (89:58 - 90:02)
balloon it'll say like four square or (90:00 - 90:04)
something like let's exchange data like (90:02 - 90:07)
you they Four Square already has (90:04 - 90:09)
location monuments that like they think (90:07 - 90:10)
I think they have the same thing as (90:09 - 90:12)
guala although I haven't used for square (90:10 - 90:15)
in like a decade But I either unless (90:12 - 90:16)
unless they got rid of that but at one (90:15 - 90:19)
point for square did have like here here (90:16 - 90:20)
are the thing you should follow maybe (90:19 - 90:21)
they got rid of it I don't know if for (90:20 - 90:23)
square is more like Yelp now where it's (90:21 - 90:26)
just like nothing but reviews I mean (90:23 - 90:29)
ntic thing has always been User (90:26 - 90:32)
submitted points of interest the Poké (90:29 - 90:35)
stops are there's all the scanning of (90:32 - 90:37)
the Poké stops for all the AR stuff (90:35 - 90:40)
they've been trying to do there's and (90:37 - 90:42)
now the routes as well but the routes (90:40 - 90:45)
are more complicated it's a much more (90:42 - 90:47)
complicated thing and also there are no (90:45 - 90:51)
rules for what you're supposed to make a (90:47 - 90:52)
route (90:51 - 90:55)
B yeah like hey this rout that Zoe did (90:52 - 90:57)
goes right across the river and there's (90:55 - 91:00)
no way to cross that properly without (90:57 - 91:02)
walking a half a mile off off of the (91:00 - 91:05)
route to cross a bridge to then walk a (91:02 - 91:07)
half mile back to the route to then (91:05 - 91:09)
continue it like mhm there was no the (91:07 - 91:11)
Centennial Lakes one that ended in the (91:09 - 91:12)
middle of the (91:11 - 91:15)
lake yeah and when you walked out on (91:12 - 91:17)
that dock I was like somebody's falling (91:15 - 91:20)
in like that's not a great (91:17 - 91:22)
experience Chris literally canel his (91:20 - 91:24)
because he didn't want to walk out there (91:22 - 91:25)
I know well that's cuz none of you none (91:24 - 91:28)
of you have been around water or docks (91:25 - 91:31)
like I have my entire life but even then (91:28 - 91:32)
I went out to the edge of that Dock and (91:31 - 91:34)
I still was not at the stopping point (91:32 - 91:37)
where that route said I should stop I (91:34 - 91:39)
was not anywhere near where the ending (91:37 - 91:41)
point was which was just like that could (91:39 - 91:43)
have that could have been like when they (91:41 - 91:46)
ended it it drifted over there I don't (91:43 - 91:47)
know if that was like they intentionally (91:46 - 91:49)
ended it in the middle of the lake I (91:47 - 91:51)
think they meant to end it back where (91:49 - 91:53)
they started and it didn't register it (91:51 - 91:55)
so it ended it (91:53 - 91:58)
early like they meant if You' if you've (91:55 - 92:01)
never created a route it's not (91:58 - 92:05)
incredibly intuitive no like when I (92:01 - 92:07)
created my first route I thought that I (92:05 - 92:10)
would be able to add points of interest (92:07 - 92:12)
mhm and it's not that it's literally (92:10 - 92:14)
just walk and it will create something (92:12 - 92:17)
behind you and then you hit done and (92:14 - 92:20)
that's it yeah yeah (92:17 - 92:23)
which you would think in maybe like 3 (92:20 - 92:26)
years if this game is still I I have no (92:23 - 92:28)
worries that Pokemon I'm very confident (92:26 - 92:31)
Pokemon go will be around in 3 years but (92:28 - 92:33)
um you would think that there would be (92:31 - 92:35)
something where it's like okay the route (92:33 - 92:36)
has five points of interest you're going (92:35 - 92:38)
to walk to this one first this one first (92:36 - 92:42)
this one first um I that in my head is (92:38 - 92:45)
like the end goal for routes but I I (92:42 - 92:47)
don't (92:45 - 92:49)
know you can rate a route you can give (92:47 - 92:51)
it a one star five I don't know what (92:49 - 92:54)
that's doing if anything I don't think (92:51 - 92:56)
it's doing anything other than to tell (92:54 - 92:59)
people hey you might you might have to (92:56 - 93:01)
swim across a giant River on this one (92:59 - 93:05)
like I don't know so like how many waits (93:01 - 93:07)
like if once it gets to the point where (93:05 - 93:09)
there are so many routes regardless of (93:07 - 93:11)
whether they are good or overlapping or (93:09 - 93:14)
whatnot uh maybe the rating will just (93:11 - 93:16)
move the better ones to the top but (93:14 - 93:19)
better is (93:16 - 93:19)
subjective oh yeah I don't think I've (93:20 - 93:24)
personally found a route that I would (93:22 - 93:28)
rate Five Stars like if I had if my (93:24 - 93:30)
Forest one had not been rejected (93:28 - 93:32)
immediately that one would be the first (93:30 - 93:35)
five star (93:32 - 93:35)
route I so proud of that I made one in (93:35 - 93:42)
Japan that was from the train station to (93:39 - 93:43)
the cat (93:42 - 93:46)
Shrine uh it was like a 10-minute walk (93:43 - 93:48)
it's it's a relatively short route but (93:46 - 93:49)
it's a relatively short walk from the (93:48 - 93:52)
train station to the catch shine but (93:49 - 93:54)
like it was pretty much what Google Maps (93:52 - 93:56)
suggested was the best way to get to the (93:54 - 93:59)
catch Shrine which is go through the (93:56 - 94:02)
main road of the city which is like a (93:59 - 94:04)
standard Japanese city of like one car (94:02 - 94:06)
can fit down this but it's mostly people (94:04 - 94:09)
walking and then cross over and then (94:06 - 94:10)
walk down this (94:09 - 94:12)
pedestrian sidewalk and then you're (94:10 - 94:14)
there at the catch rine and so I made (94:12 - 94:17)
that route still hasn't gotten approved (94:14 - 94:20)
there was no routes there to do I like I (94:17 - 94:21)
checked like no one made a route to the (94:20 - 94:23)
catch run (94:21 - 94:25)
um (94:23 - 94:30)
so yeah you can check in uh in campfire (94:25 - 94:33)
now you can see campire oh that's cool (94:30 - 94:35)
oh I can't still can't get campfire to (94:33 - 94:38)
work campfire has actually been uh I (94:35 - 94:39)
don't know if improved is the right word (94:38 - 94:42)
but changed air I us campire recently (94:39 - 94:44)
and I was like oh wow like that was (94:42 - 94:45)
actually helpful but it was it was I (94:44 - 94:48)
think to check for like oh I used it in (94:45 - 94:50)
Seattle cuz I was like oh is there any (94:48 - 94:52)
Zapdos raids around here for Community (94:50 - 94:54)
day and it was it was slightly helpful (94:52 - 94:56)
for finding a Zapdos (94:54 - 95:00)
raid um not that anyone came to my flare (94:56 - 95:03)
but I at least found the (95:00 - 95:03)
raid uh I think last last bit of news is (95:04 - 95:10)
uh I got an announcement uh for the one (95:07 - 95:12)
person listening to this podcast that (95:10 - 95:15)
will be at the South Korean Safari Zone (95:12 - 95:20)
uh I will also be there uh Niantic as of (95:15 - 95:22)
like two days ago was like we're ready (95:20 - 95:23)
to book you a (95:22 - 95:27)
flight and I was like okay I mean when (95:23 - 95:29)
you say we're ready you are booking the (95:27 - 95:32)
flight for a week to Korea because I can (95:29 - 95:35)
tell you that those prices have gone (95:32 - 95:37)
dramatically up and they were like yep (95:35 - 95:39)
we (95:37 - 95:39)
know that (95:40 - 95:46)
works I I when I planned my first trip (95:42 - 95:50)
to Japan I spent like 6 months planning (95:46 - 95:54)
it I had EX spre Excel spreadsheet I had (95:50 - 95:57)
Google Docs I had things listed when I (95:54 - 95:59)
went to the world (95:57 - 96:01)
championship again multiple months of (95:59 - 96:03)
planning when I originally went to South (96:01 - 96:05)
Korea last year that was like two months (96:03 - 96:09)
of planning planning a week to I am so (96:05 - 96:11)
over I didn't even pay for this trip (96:09 - 96:14)
Niantic has paid for this I'm still (96:11 - 96:16)
stressed that like oh in 7 days I'm (96:14 - 96:18)
getting on a 14-hour flight to South (96:16 - 96:22)
Korea uh and I and the last time I (96:18 - 96:23)
talked to Niantic they were like we're (96:22 - 96:25)
not sure where to get a hotel yet oh (96:23 - 96:27)
okay I guess we'll figure (96:25 - 96:30)
that cool cool cool uh I guess I'm (96:27 - 96:33)
sleeping on the street the this what (96:30 - 96:35)
always when I used to have to book trips (96:33 - 96:38)
for work it always boggled me that I'm (96:35 - 96:41)
like okay I have found this the cheapest (96:38 - 96:45)
price you have told me that we need to (96:41 - 96:47)
save money I have found a flight and if (96:45 - 96:50)
you can just approve it this week I can (96:47 - 96:52)
get this flight for 200 (96:50 - 96:55)
$0000 3 weeks later oh hey book the (96:52 - 96:59)
flight it is now $600 more oh yeah we (96:55 - 97:01)
figured what are you doing also you (96:59 - 97:03)
won't let me stay at a cheap hotel (97:01 - 97:05)
because by your standards I have to stay (97:03 - 97:07)
at the more expensive hotel that has a (97:05 - 97:10)
breakfast that I'm not going to eat but (97:07 - 97:12)
it has to be there so instead of me (97:10 - 97:14)
paying $100 a night to stay in the hotel (97:12 - 97:17)
that I want that's actually across the (97:14 - 97:18)
street from the cson you're sending me (97:17 - 97:21)
to I have to be an Uber drive away at (97:18 - 97:24)
the $400 Hotel because it has a (97:21 - 97:27)
breakfast because that's what they like (97:24 - 97:30)
yeah the the ntic problem is not any (97:27 - 97:32)
different than anyone any Corporation (97:30 - 97:34)
booking flights or hotels it just is so (97:32 - 97:37)
weird it's very nice that they were like (97:34 - 97:38)
we're going to send you to South Korea (97:37 - 97:40)
for the Safari Zone I have no clue what (97:38 - 97:42)
to expect I'm going to turn on my stream (97:40 - 97:45)
backpack so I believe the Safari Zone is (97:42 - 97:47)
the seventh in the 8th of (97:45 - 97:50)
October uh I'm leaving a little bit (97:47 - 97:52)
early because (97:50 - 97:54)
I don't know if you try to book a flight (97:52 - 97:56)
in a week a lot of those flights (97:54 - 97:59)
are already over booked they're all (97:56 - 98:01)
they're full they're full they're full (97:59 - 98:06)
um miss good sleep day on a plane right (98:01 - 98:10)
no uh I would leave on October 1st and I (98:06 - 98:13)
get into Korea the 2 and because all the (98:10 - 98:16)
flights were overbooked I was like I (98:13 - 98:18)
want to get there a little bit early in (98:16 - 98:22)
case I'm over bumped yeah in case I get (98:18 - 98:24)
bumped (98:22 - 98:28)
um uh so I will be in (98:24 - 98:31)
Korea very (98:28 - 98:34)
soon when I tell you this listener I am (98:31 - 98:36)
also just a (98:34 - 98:40)
sh oh what where did I where was I just (98:36 - 98:42)
flying to when I flew to (98:40 - 98:46)
Atlanta for Dragon Con and I was walking (98:42 - 98:49)
past a gate this is what I heard we are (98:46 - 98:53)
now offering three (98:49 - 98:56)
$1,000 for somebody to not take this (98:53 - 98:59)
flight cuz we are overed take in a heart (98:56 - 99:00)
I would have been I'm not even on this (98:59 - 99:03)
flight I know and I was like well hold (99:00 - 99:04)
on a (99:03 - 99:06)
sec I suppose I have to prove that I (99:04 - 99:07)
would have a ticket on this flight to (99:06 - 99:10)
collect this $3,000 but there were so (99:07 - 99:12)
many people who are like no I need to (99:10 - 99:15)
get home you that is still too little (99:12 - 99:18)
too mess up my entire (99:15 - 99:22)
life when I was flying to New York for (99:18 - 99:24)
Pokémon sleep which the Pokémon company (99:22 - 99:26)
paid for um which was also like a last (99:24 - 99:28)
minute flight but not nearly expensive (99:26 - 99:31)
because it was New York not South Korea (99:28 - 99:34)
not overseas when I was sitting at the (99:31 - 99:37)
terminal they were like we're offering (99:34 - 99:41)
$500 and the next flight is in an hour (99:37 - 99:42)
you're taking (99:41 - 99:45)
$500 for the next flight to be in an (99:42 - 99:46)
hour and I was (99:45 - 99:50)
like I want to take this so bad but also (99:46 - 99:51)
this is cutting it really close cuz cuz (99:50 - 99:53)
like my flight was hours before the (99:51 - 99:57)
meeting like my meeting was the same day (99:53 - 99:59)
and I was like if they booked me (99:57 - 100:02)
literally the day before I would and (99:59 - 100:03)
they would have been like ah next (100:02 - 100:04)
flight's in like 3 hours I would been (100:03 - 100:06)
like I can I can waste three hours in (100:04 - 100:08)
the airport for 500 bucks that's that's (100:06 - 100:10)
like (100:08 - 100:12)

American $300 in food credit that you (100:35 - 100:43)
can only use on the only use here always (100:38 - 100:45)
always read the fine print it was wild (100:43 - 100:47)
to me that people were like nope an I (100:45 - 100:50)
can't wait an hour for five I mean I I (100:47 - 100:52)
couldn't cuz I literally have may I (100:50 - 100:55)
could do it but I can't believe nobody (100:52 - 100:57)
else could nobody else could have (100:55 - 101:01)
reasons only I could uh so yeah so just (100:57 - 101:03)
disclosure Niantic is paying for my (101:01 - 101:07)
flight in my hotel for soul in South (101:03 - 101:11)
Korea I will be there apparently um I (101:07 - 101:12)
don't know who else will be there I (101:11 - 101:13)
don't think we have a lot of South (101:12 - 101:16)
Korean listeners according to my (101:13 - 101:20)
analytics not that attitude um I'm GNA (101:16 - 101:21)
try to (101:20 - 101:24)
bring the stream backpack uh stream that (101:21 - 101:26)
event it's should be eight hours for (101:24 - 101:27)
both days there's supposed to be like a (101:26 - 101:29)
city experience a raid pass experience I (101:27 - 101:31)
didn't realize this until literally (101:29 - 101:32)
relooking at the stuff because (101:31 - 101:34)
originally when they announced the (101:32 - 101:35)
Safari zones one for Korea one for (101:34 - 101:38)
Barcelona one for Mexico City they (101:35 - 101:40)
didn't really have a lot of (101:38 - 101:43)
details besides here are the dates and I (101:40 - 101:45)
think skadoo will be the Pokemon they (101:43 - 101:50)
turn shiny for these Safari zones uh so (101:45 - 101:51)
I don't know if there's like a real (101:50 - 101:53)
world equivalent that's going to happen (101:51 - 101:55)
of like oh Safari on Korea is happening (101:53 - 101:58)
but if you everywhere else sco will have (101:55 - 102:00)
like a Time research or something I (101:58 - 102:05)
don't I have no clue um I always (102:00 - 102:07)
disclose sometimes there is sometimes (102:05 - 102:09)
there isn't yeah I'm I'm literally just (102:07 - 102:11)
disclosing the flight is being paid for (102:09 - 102:14)
in hotels cuz I have to per the FTC when (102:11 - 102:17)
companies pay for stuff uh if I don't (102:14 - 102:19)
say that they didn't pay for it it's cuz (102:17 - 102:20)
nitic has not paid for my hotel for (102:19 - 102:23)
Japan I which is at this point the (102:20 - 102:24)
person who said they were going to pay (102:23 - 102:26)
for it no longer works there so now it's (102:24 - 102:30)
stuck in legal limbo um this is already (102:26 - 102:33)
taken care of but I try to disclose not (102:30 - 102:34)
because I'm like bragging or anything (102:33 - 102:37)
because I legally I have to you have to (102:34 - 102:40)
so they're going to have EES with uh (102:37 - 102:43)
Explorer hats I did see that that that (102:40 - 102:45)
that is uh kind of exciting CU I think (102:43 - 102:50)
this is the first time that hat existed (102:45 - 102:52)
mhm (102:50 - 102:55)
so got all of those Evolutions with that (102:52 - 102:56)
new hat got all of those Evolution (102:55 - 102:58)
shinies with that new hat that's so many (102:56 - 103:03)
new hats so my storage is already full (102:58 - 103:04)
and I got to figure out how to make sto (103:03 - 103:06)
this is the real scam Niantic like watch (103:04 - 103:08)
all these people have to increase their (103:06 - 103:11)
storage for Eevee (103:08 - 103:14)
