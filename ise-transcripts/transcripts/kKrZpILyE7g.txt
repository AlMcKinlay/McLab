episode of the pokemon podcast my name is SBJ I usually say what episode number it is but since the recordings this week have been all over the place I will edit that in to post yeah uh we have Travis with us today hate to derail the show so early but now that Pokemon is 20 years old I feel like I need to get it out like any 20 year old I'm gonna worry I'm worrying that Pokemon is going to get to the phase where it starts caring too much about ultimate frisbee and it starts hanging Reservoir Dogs posters i think as responsible parents Steve you and I need to put a stop to this we'll have to we'll have to have the in bed parent to parent talk to leave yeah about our 20 year old child that we had to look a little weird transition um we also have Allegra back from polygon hi hello you're back so soon I'm so so so back so excited to be back so we are recording this on februari 27th it is the 20th anniversary not a standard episode of course but we will be we wanted to record as soon as we could to talk about the recent pokemon news and the amazingly long six minute Pokemon direct that we were blessed with let's uh yeah let's let's talk about that first so it was at nine a.m. central time seven Pacific and we had a six-minute long nintendo direct or pokemon direct i should say that opened with a little original gameboy teaser and then the CEO of pokemon who i can never say his his name correctly ishihara sounds right to me yeah i can't can't really offer you much help there and we then moved into a trailer talking with a bunch of kids and different countries going back and forth through Game Boys and ds's and Game Boy advances and it really focused on for things and focused on collecting it focused on trading it focused on battling and then it the last one was connecting which I thought was a really important aspect of Pokemon that doesn't actually get talked about a lot you always hear about the color the collecting in the trading in the battling but the the connection thing I think was something that hit home with me a lot actually kind of like gave chills down my spine of like really the first three can't really be possible without the fourth and it's what this show is all about to right I mean that's why we're here so let's stop there and and and talk about that like did you guys like what they were doing up to this point in the in the little direct was was that something that was cool to you to see yeah I definitely was a big fan of that cute little video um I mean just kind of the nature of my work is that I was like had one eye on the direct in another ion like my CMS getting ready to like type up the announcement so like I wasn't totally enjoying it in the purely nostalgic way but um what I did get to see was it I mean it was really cool to like you know have the different like intro screens from different games and just kind of like be reminded of you know seeing these games for the first time it's like that nostalgic overload was really really cool and something I liked was you know there was that super bowl commercial back in them I guess it was earlier this month or whatever right which was kind of going after that same vein of like Pokemon turning 20 let's all be nostalgic and remember how great it is but that like that didn't feel like what pokemon is to me like it didn't really touch on like the major tenets of pokemon but this one definitely felt more familiar and in that sense it was like really exciting is both it used you know the actual games but also just really captured that core feeling of like pokemon is about being a kid and yeah so I thought it did a really good job and it kind of masked the fact that this was like a really really short direct that was totally light on any new information whatsoever I thought so I enjoyed it as well and it Steve I hope i'm not i'm getting ahead too much but i like that the the promotional material for this is in a similar way to how Cala or how x and y were promoted where there is a heavy emphasis on the international aspect of Pokemon when X&Y we're announced and we're coming out there's a lot of things about the different translations that it was going to be in it's cool to see that it's also going to be translated into simplified and traditional Chinese not that I speak other languages but I love that aspect of Pokemon I loved in x and y where there were the different ah vivillon varieties depending on the region you are in and how you had to trade with people all throughout the world to get it so I hope that the fact that they're adding Chinese is a language and they're emphasizing different languages in the direct I hope that that indicates they'll be more stuff like that yeah that will we can move right into the actual announcement that led into what Travis was touching on we got another mini movie Pokemon is always about like these lease like one to two-minute clips of capturing your emotions it started off with of course red and green and they moved on the yellow and then moves throughout the entire games the main game series all the way up to a black screen of 2016 and then we got the official announcement of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon moon which was both it was to me still exciting even though we got the rumors the day before like I was I was like so like oh my god it's like real this is awesome and it might have been like the the emotion and the sigh of like oh god we weren't wrong yesterday but it was also like finally we're getting something this year as a main series game and without really saying it I mean they did go on to say that this is a new adventure which is them saying that this is really generation 7 mm-hmm and we even saw brief shots of what appear to be new Pokemon being modeled on a like the skeleton of a new Pokemon design being modeled in a computer which by the way people are already extrapolating from like the skeleton of that future Pokemon that it's going to be a woodpecker and people are already drawing fan art of it oh wow tumblr moves fast oh my god yeah I saw reddit was already like theorizing so hardcore about like the entirety of the starters are gonna be in this game I'm like yo we know nothing about it calm down please there was one pixel in frame 42 of the direct Jesus but actually for your psychic starter it's it's funny but it's also like well at least they're giving us something to talk about it yeah yeah yeah for real yeah when I I first saw the wire from that Pokemon it looked a lot like a fletching but when you go back and you go through it a couple times because they showed it so fast it's it's clearly a new Pokemon and if it is indeed a woodpecker that would be really exciting because we don't have one of those yet there are still some animals that Pokemon haven't been based off right favorite Lee my apparently my favorite thing on the show to do recently used to make baseless predictions I think I did a lot of that last time I was on the show my new baseless prediction is that this is a woodpecker and that at least it's evolved form is going to have skill link is that the ability that makes it so that um multi-hit moves like rock blasts and stuff it right yeah full number of times it's going to have that because woodpeckers like a chicken pecking like groups of four what have you that's my prediction right now if in the future I'm right I don't know someone that was me a dollar there was also so we also saw some we didn't see any gameplay footage which was actually disappointing did you expect gameplay footage I expected like well I remember when they announced um was it'll make a ruby alpha sapphire they didn't show the actual game but they gave us like they gave us kyogre coming on the water and they gave us grout on they gave us like 20 seconds of footage and it was like oh cool like it looks like we're still on the X&Y engine or mmm like yeah this is still exciting I think it was more disappointing in the aspect of oh we already like knew the names yeah definitely the last announcement kind of made up for that and we'll get to that in a second but I wanted to go back to the trailer and the weird thing that stood out that everyone kind of grabbed onto is there was a lot of illustrations and designs for cars and trucks mm-hmm and there was a what looked like a fire truck except Blastoise was standing at the top instead of water cannon being up there so I don't know if in the Pokemon world Shh they just use Blastoise which kind of my sense and kind of leaf if moving companies are just groups of machak as evidenced by the opening of Ruby and Sapphire then and I think anything is possible they work these Pokemon hard guys this is money just to yeah uh yeah but that was interesting we and and from the base off the other screenshots we got what looked to be more of a summer / tropical area now that's not to say that you know in something like ruby and sapphire there's not like a snowy mountain on top that separates from everything I think black and white had something like that too but people were already going oh it could possibly be in Hawaii or maybe this is actually Spain which we were talking about a little bit on episodes before but we saw what maybe look like a Pokemon school or a Pokemon gym with a horsey statue in front and we had all our are all our pok√©mon cars that maybe we will drive if not there was the taxi service in x and y that was actually kind of cool no game a gameplay footage but it was cool to see those illustrations something cool about that is like which kind of leads into the other answer that you're either you want to talk about um is that these are all gen one pokemon being featured in this in this new game so I'm kind of interested to see how you know the canto region could factor in like if there's some relationship between oh that Jen and this one especially with the announcement I I'm gonna spoil it here guys I'm gonna make it but um so Pokemon bank which is the 3ds app that lets you transfer your Pokemon between games it's going to interact with the virtual console releases of red blue and yellow which I guess are actually out today so you can transfer your Pokemon into that app which is cool so it makes it easier to transfer between you know the different virtual console releases but then it also will allow you to download those gen one Pokemon into sun and moon so we know that gen 1 poco will factor into sun and moon because of that but then all the things you're pointing out speak to me or tell me that like there's going to be some greater connection to the original generation which is kind of interesting I think I hadn't really thought about that but it makes sense for them to do it when it's it when you're talking about a game announced on a 20th anniversary and they're really pushing the sort of different generations of players aspect in the and the marketing and that I don't know I think that makes sense with the general direction that that they've been going that would be interesting to see yeah this there was also sorry to interrupt but there's this also this 3ds leak on some forums of like the different games that are coming out this year thanks I don't know if you guys saw this post but some guy who has a source of Nintendo leaked like the whole dad works in the day some guy who's uncle's best friend's cousin works at Nintendo gave him like 3ds lineup of like games coming up is here and one of them was called the pokemon 20th anniversary game code name EG which you know we just got these games announced which aren't called niji but apparently like on the assets that were released for the logos the file names were called me g oh wow so that you know kind of points the fact that these are those 20th anniversary games which it makes sense because they are coming out during the 20th anniversary but i definitely think there's going to be some strong angle there mm-hmm there there's two points i want to touch on for the red red yellow blue releases that i think we're that are kind of important the first one being that when you transfer these pokemon from your virtual console games into pokemon bank they can only interact with Pokemon Sun and Pokemon moon they didn't say that during the six minute trailer obviously they were very they were on a strict six minute schedule but if you go to poke my calm it does say that these won't work with XY or Omega Ruby alpha sapphire so I'm assuming that in Sun and Moon there will probably be some not mini game but there were many games in the past to get pokemon from other generations the two-year game but i wonder if there's going to be almost like a facility or something to help randomly generate those abilities and those stat that's the stat breakups that the that word would have been the wall from mm-hmm generation 1 2 now generation 7 the second thing i want to touch on is how that I've been very vocal on the show of how I thought Pokemon bank was very very important to the first generation games more so that Pokemon has always made a big deal of well generation 1 and 2 kind of got stuck and kind of got left behind when we moved to generation 3 because of the hardware and it was so weird to me that they like they've always come back and said like we're sorry we weren't able to do this and then they would go hey we're going to release these virtual console games and you know that thing we kept complaining about before well you know these games aren't going to connect either so it was very exciting that they did connect it and actually I'm ok with them keeping that a surprise because at the time when they announced it and they didn't say anything about working with Pokemon bank and I got a lot of I got a lot of heat for that being like oh well the abilities in the special attack and physical attack for this too complicated they can't do it the technology just isn't there there was stat XP then we have v's now I am so glad that they did that and I think it's it's important to people to you know put time in and they it a way it changed my mind from not wanting by these games because I don't like to play pokemon games that I can't carry pokemon with me from generation to generation went from me not wanting to buy these to not wanting to buy all three I also think it's very important for people who are there are so many people who just love generation one I know the verge just put up an article today about Pokemon it was an article referring to i apologize i don't know the author but he put his top ten pokemon and i look that and I was like oh my gosh these are all generation one pokemon like this is not the top 10 list I like because I like seeing the range from generation 16 but if you just look at the comments alone you just see how many people just love Charizard or love Bulbasaur it's so many people who love generation one and if you want to bring those people from if you want to fast-track those people to generation one to generation seven there's no like better way for teasing like hey you know that pokemon copy already bought for ten dollars you know that Charizard that you loved well now if you buy Pokemon Sun and Moon we can bring that Charizard with you and I think that's a very good and important way to bring those generation players into the new series which is obviously something they want to do to play the cynic for a little bit do you think that it's truly the case that there would have been no way for them to have the Virtual Console Pokemon transfer to you x and y or a mega ruby and alpha sapphire and that that's why it's only sun and moon or do you think and this is question for both of you or do you think that sorry i'm losing my train of thought what are you good or do you think that it's more of a move to sell units because that way they actually have to get the new game as opposed to just uploading it to their little cousins copy of alpha sapphire I definitely see it as like a marketing ploy like I don't I can't really fathom a reason other than like there are metagame differences whatever but I can't really fathom any significant reason to not allow these games to connect with the other three dias ones i honestly think it is a way to like i know so many people who you know only care about the older pokemon games like they call themselves gen Wars you know like absolutely contingent of pokemon fan so I don't know that people are necessarily going out to buy the 3s just for these releases although they totally have that option with that new 3d s bundle but um I there are people who only are interested in those games and these those older ones and those older pokemon so explicitly saying hey buying these releases will give you easy access to getting these same pokemon in the new game so like you don't even have to mess with those weird other generations worth of Pokemon you don't know you can just bring your Charizard Senor you know your other popular gen 1 Pokemon right to the next one and you could even just start the game theoretically and just only use your gen 1 Pokemon still so it's just like a high quality you know fancier version of the game that you're already playing I just think it's like a really smart way that bring in those more nostalgic fans who don't really want to down to like the excessive very long history of Pokemon games that's really if I can be really intimidating to jump into if you haven't already been following along so I definitely think it's like a very concerted effort to appeal to those you know nostalgic fans who haven't necessarily been buying all the other games yeah yeah and pokemons going to always struggle where where is the right onboarding process for new players and I think I think black and white did a very good job at its period of bringing new people in I think x and y did a very good job of bringing new people in omega ruby alpha sapphire not so much it seemed more like fanservice than anything but I've had a couple friends who I would say that they are gen winners they don't believe anything exists after the first 150 Pokemon the kind of people who say can you believe they made an ice cream pocket man probably the same type of people but uh I had those people reach out to me man and these are people i don't talk to regularly or if if if even once a month but they reach out to me and they're like so how much is a 3ds do you have to get an SD card ok these are and how did the game save and what kind of charges do they use in library like legit considering getting a 3ds just for and and this was more than more than a handful of people that reached out to me and it was like okay like you guys are really like into this that's that's awesome and now i can say like hey if you if that was like what you liked and you actually went out and purchased 3ds and you played through red and blue again and like don't let your 3ds be a paperweight now that you've done what you went out to bought it for if go get sun and moon this holiday and take those pokemon with you and hopefully that is why i believe that's the mindset that game freak and pokemon company have but hopefully that does actually translate to customers into pokemon players yeah some other tidbits here from the presentation they did state that 275 million video games have been sold since the debut of pokemon red and green back in 1996 that is a lot and we touch we touched on traditional and simplified chinese being added to the game even if this doesn't apply for you this is still good for the long run because if they can sell more copies of the games that's more money that's more development that's more pokemon things in the future so that's good i have a quote here from JC smith the senior director of consumer marketing from tcp i-- he said the poke mon coeur series games are the center of the Pokemon universe and provides some of the most memorable pokemon moments for our fans i can't wait to see what fans think of the new adventures that will find in Pokemon Sun and Pokemon moon and yeah that was pretty much it that we got from the announcement so can we talk about my favorite part can we talk about baseless rumors sure yes I saw this one that I hope is untrue I'm negative I should be more positive thank you have the negative 1 Travis there's a new game coming out which I am over the moon I am over the Pokemon Sun and Moon about oh I can think about is rumors that I hate one of those rumors is that the the games will focus on pokemon human hybrids like I have ashes like ash's greninja being one of them I think we've already seen I believe it was in a corocoro article yes it's also an anime oh right right fine to be in the enemy and so there's that detail the second detail is that there is these little at least in the Japanese logos it seemed like that was the only place it was maybe I just missed it in the English logos but at least in the Japanese logos there's little crystals on both of them in a similar way to how there was the mega stone in the x and y logo there's these little crystals in the southern moon logo and those crystals are shaped identically to crystals that were used in the pokemon reversed manga oh I should credit whoever I'm stealing this from on Twitter so I'll look that up while I'm explaining it in the Pokemon reverse manga the premise of that book is that Pokemon fused with humans and then they fight in fact that it looks identical and we've announced ash's greninja as an actual thing lends credence to the idea and i don't love it but we'll see how that sounds like the fourth season of digimon yeah but which was terrible so please god no yeah I i hope that ash's greninja is something that stays in the anime just like it sounds like shadow Mewtwo is kind of only staying in the pokin tournament universe and just like the dark lugia and we stayed in gale of darkness I'm okay with stuff like that yeah I do want to shout out Allegra here for putting together one heck of an article on polygon calm yes I do this was posted just yesterday actually and you were unsure if you were gonna get it up I remember the last time we talked right yeah it was a long arduous process fighting with technology to make that little timeline it's like a chronological timeline of like all of the major Pokemon releases by my own estimation of what counts as a major release so just kind of trekking along the very long 20 year span of the series just noting you know each major release over the years and it took a real real real long time to put together so you guys check it out for reals anyway yeah it's really cool it makes me forget like b.o it reminds me that the Ranger games existed at one point yeah it's so weird that like they had three of those and then they just completely stopped and I think they sold pretty well like people like those games right maybe and then we just stopped making them after 2010 or whatever just completely fell off the face of the earth yeah that's why I've never played any of the Ranger games I just remember playing the first one cuz i wanted the manaphy i think you can get so maybe that was like everyone else too were they everyone just bought it just for the legendary and then they were like oh maybe people actually like these games but it's like no Nintendo we just want the town load right an easy way to sell a game attach a legendary that you can only get yeah same with a Pokemon Colosseum man all got it for the jirachi and then the other one was the Celebi that you could get when you bought that weird Pokemon ranch thing on the gamecube or was that we ah we yeah we where you could just store more Pokemon it was like pokemon bank before connecting to the internet mmhmm yeah so great article I'm polygon if you want to check that out otherwise I think that kind of wraps up our show I'm sure it can I give credit to the person I stole that rumor for oh yeah Emily I don't know this person and I don't you know if in some of their other tweets they start spouting hateful language or something like that I don't want to say that I'm advocate I didn't look I don't know I got a person this is what I'm telling you to look at but at least it was retweeted into my timeline from this Noah chills person NOAA ch ch I llz on Twitter I don't know if they started it well that's where as retweeted side note to try and find this tweet I searched on Twitter or on tweet specifically for human hybrids and I scrolled a little too far and my god for today and there's people have some interesting things to say about Hillary Clinton okay all right full circle no full circle back to back to Hillary glitch always goes back to Hillary uh alegra I didn't ask you this the first time and I'm gonna ask you now before we wrap up what is your favorite Pokemon oh man my absolute favorite Pokemon of all time is Charmander put that on the record nah Charizard not charizard charizard I can take or leave Charmander though Charmander is good job and erskine oh i forgot to say real quick i did go to toys r us this morning I took my meat took my niece and met up with my sister and I they gave out two cards a magic carpet and a Pikachu they gave out a little activity booklet which is more or less a coloring book they gave out a pretty thick poster which actually featured the go figure the first 151 Pokemon but a very nice quality poster that was actually aligned at my toys r us to get it but they had plenty of stuff and if you're listening to this today I'm februari 27th toys r us is doing a sale on pokemon stuff amazon.com
