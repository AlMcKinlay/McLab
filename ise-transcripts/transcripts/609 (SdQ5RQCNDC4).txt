I am recording B I am recording am (0:00 - 0:05)
[Music] (0:06 - 0:17)
recording what's up everyone welcome to (0:15 - 0:18)
the (0:17 - 0:21)
609th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:18 - 0:22)
it's super effective I am your host (0:21 - 0:27)
Steve with me is Hanah hello I am here (0:22 - 0:30)
uh yesterday I thought I didn't get sun (0:27 - 0:32)
bur during Community day cuz I did put (0:30 - 0:34)
on sunscreen and I think I think I may (0:32 - 0:37)
have gotten just a little bit (0:34 - 0:40)
sunburnt wait you play outside (0:37 - 0:44)
crazy when it's nice when it's not awful (0:40 - 0:46)
weather uh Bobby is also here with us (0:44 - 0:49)
this week also an outside Pokemon go (0:46 - 0:51)
player in the the rare times that (0:49 - 0:53)
there's nice weather here in San Diego (0:51 - 0:58)
yeah the the rare yeah just a few days a (0:53 - 1:03)
year I played Pokemon go at the (0:58 - 1:03)
mall it was very (1:03 - 1:08)
crowded it was actually really cold (1:06 - 1:11)
yesterday it was like 37 and very very (1:08 - 1:13)
very windy so it just like cut right (1:11 - 1:16)
through you the classic Midwest of like (1:13 - 1:17)
it'd be really nice out if it wasn't for (1:16 - 1:19)
the (1:17 - 1:19)
wind (1:19 - 1:24)
yeah uh we got a show for you guys today (1:21 - 1:26)
we have uh just three topics uh Pokemon (1:24 - 1:29)
sleep which uh will probably be look (1:26 - 1:32)
there's a lot of Pokemon sleep cuz they (1:29 - 1:33)
introduce one legendary Pokemon in (1:32 - 1:35)
Pokemon sleep and they have to give us a (1:33 - 1:38)
six-part diagram in order to like break (1:35 - 1:40)
this down to catch a Legendary Pokemon (1:38 - 1:42)
which I'm assuming most people won't be (1:40 - 1:44)
able to at the very end I don't know (1:42 - 1:47)
we'll tell you how to do it um so you're (1:44 - 1:49)
prepared uh if you're listening to this (1:47 - 1:51)
on Monday you're still good you got a (1:49 - 1:53)
full week technically before raicho (1:51 - 1:56)
shows up um we got some Pokemon Go stuff (1:53 - 1:59)
and then we have some Pokemon TCG stuff (1:56 - 2:01)
if look if Bobby's on the show it just (1:59 - 2:06)
know that there will be TCG stuff (2:01 - 2:06)
yeah yeah that's it's weird I started (2:06 - 2:11)
off coming onto this show as someone who (2:09 - 2:13)
would talk more about go and have (2:11 - 2:16)
somehow transitioned into the person who (2:13 - 2:20)
talks about TCG so I think TCG is easier (2:16 - 2:21)
to take your money than go this makes (2:20 - 2:25)
sense for you it that's one thing I'm an (2:21 - 2:28)
expert in and uh yeah the TCG wins out (2:25 - 2:30)
over go to be honest (2:28 - 2:33)
still Pokemon go is really trying there (2:30 - 2:35)
yeah they're they're they're up there (2:33 - 2:39)
but TCG that's that's a hard one to beat (2:35 - 2:41)
honestly (2:39 - 2:44)
perfect well let's uh let's talk about (2:41 - 2:45)
Pokemon (2:44 - 2:50)
sleep uh riko is officially coming I'm (2:45 - 2:51)
not exaggerating there is like a (2:50 - 2:53)
four-part diagram and then like two (2:51 - 2:56)
other articles describing (2:53 - 3:01)
raicho uh here's here's the first bit of (2:56 - 3:03)
I guess not misinformation raicho (3:01 - 3:06)
technically doesn't come until the 25th (3:03 - 3:07)
I think people thought it was coming (3:06 - 3:10)
this week because it was like electric (3:07 - 3:13)
week just happened which was fine I (3:10 - 3:15)
guess um depending on what island you (3:13 - 3:18)
went to I don't know Hannah how was your (3:15 - 3:21)
electric week I saw one den the whole (3:18 - 3:23)
time and I used a master ball on it and (3:21 - 3:25)
it's helping me out a whole bunch but I (3:23 - 3:28)
also got an amazing Pichu that has (3:25 - 3:30)
really brought me back to the game (3:28 - 3:33)
so that's what that's what you needed (3:30 - 3:35)
you needed the Pichu we got almost (3:33 - 3:38)
completely gold sub skills I when I (3:35 - 3:41)
caught it we got to back up a second I (3:38 - 3:43)
as as as we know I do not play Pokemon (3:41 - 3:46)
sleep so I do not have all of the same (3:43 - 3:48)
information that you two do um why are (3:46 - 3:51)
you using a master ball on the (3:48 - 3:54)
D I want to be clear Bobby doesn't play (3:51 - 3:56)
Pokemon sleep because he he did the life (3:54 - 3:58)
thing of having (3:56 - 3:58)
children (3:59 - 4:03)
yeah (4:01 - 4:06)
yeah um I I I used a master ball on the (4:03 - 4:09)
den because I'm not a very high level in (4:06 - 4:12)
Pokemon sleep okay and I figured I would (4:09 - 4:14)
only get a chance to encounter it once (4:12 - 4:17)
on the one night I could use an incense (4:14 - 4:19)
that would force it to appear so I (4:17 - 4:21)
figured it probably wouldn't come back (4:19 - 4:24)
again and it had too many bars I had to (4:21 - 4:29)
fill up to use a weaker cookie on it so (4:24 - 4:32)
I used ball it's a it's a cookie master (4:29 - 4:35)
ball cookie okay so this is something (4:32 - 4:37)
that you can have more of one of then (4:35 - 4:39)
yeah so you can buy one Master Ball a (4:37 - 4:43)
month but they're 4,000 points which is (4:39 - 4:45)
a lot of points for especially for a (4:43 - 4:50)
free-to-play player got it for a premium (4:45 - 4:53)
user like (4:50 - 4:53)
myself I would I would say on average a (4:53 - 4:58)
premium user probably gets anywhere (4:56 - 5:00)
between like 7,000 to (4:58 - 5:03)
10,000 points a month so a master ball (5:00 - 5:06)
isn't people argue that a master ball is (5:03 - 5:07)
a bad (5:06 - 5:10)
investment okay because there hasn't (5:07 - 5:13)
been a legendary Pokemon until now right (5:10 - 5:16)
well that's what I was gonna say so like (5:13 - 5:18)
Pokemon like Den or absil or (5:16 - 5:20)
Kangaskhan uh I don't know why I said (5:18 - 5:23)
Kangaskhan so funny um they have a lot (5:20 - 5:25)
of bars to fill so even if you had a (5:23 - 5:28)
premium biscuit which is what I get uh (5:25 - 5:31)
that's four and then if it's hungry it's (5:28 - 5:33)
times three so ultimately you get 12 (5:31 - 5:37)
bars okay but I believe den den and (5:33 - 5:41)
absil they have 16 bars oh which means (5:37 - 5:42)
even with a premium biscuit they don't (5:41 - 5:45)
fill so if you do math this is really (5:42 - 5:47)
silly that gets you to 12 and then if (5:45 - 5:49)
you do a grape biscuits that's three (5:47 - 5:51)
which gets you to 15 then you need one (5:49 - 5:54)
Pokeball but sometimes they they get (5:51 - 5:58)
hungry after two so you could do premium (5:54 - 6:00)
great ball and now it's hungry and (5:58 - 6:02)
you're you were like it's full full yeah (6:00 - 6:04)
it's full sorry so it won't take any (6:02 - 6:05)
more cookies it won't take any more (6:04 - 6:08)
biscuits after it's full and then (6:05 - 6:09)
there's not there's a chance where it (6:08 - 6:13)
just doesn't come back I see okay I'm (6:09 - 6:17)
following so and that leads to another (6:13 - 6:21)
question is the den was CAU in oh can (6:17 - 6:22)
you you can have more than one Master (6:21 - 6:24)
Ball or master ball cookie or whatever (6:22 - 6:27)
at a time though right yeah so like you (6:24 - 6:29)
you can buy one last month and then you (6:27 - 6:31)
can buy one this month and catch your (6:29 - 6:33)
raicho in it potentially if you have to (6:31 - 6:35)
do that or (6:33 - 6:38)
something yes well there will be rco (6:35 - 6:41)
biscuits oh (6:38 - 6:43)
God all right all right we can just (6:41 - 6:45)
continue on you guys can that's a good (6:43 - 6:47)
question that's a good (6:45 - 6:50)
question okay so electric week is (6:47 - 6:53)
technically over right it was one week (6:50 - 6:55)
to get you prepared you you can start (6:53 - 6:57)
collecting stuff for raicho this week (6:55 - 7:00)
which we'll get to but REO will not (6:57 - 7:04)
start appearing until March 25th at 300 (7:00 - 7:07)
p.m. your time and then you can use a (7:04 - 7:11)
raicho incense raicho will only appear (7:07 - 7:12)
on green (7:11 - 7:15)
grass uh it says appearing at Green (7:12 - 7:17)
Grass aisle REO may still appear during (7:15 - 7:19)
regular sleep research even after the (7:17 - 7:22)
raicho research event ends but it is (7:19 - 7:26)
extremely rare reiko's sleep type is (7:22 - 7:29)
snoozing okay to explain this to Bobby (7:26 - 7:30)
when you go to sleep you either have (7:29 - 7:33)
snoozing dozing or slumbering okay so if (7:30 - 7:35)
you're slumbering which is a deep sleep (7:33 - 7:37)
you won't have raicho spawn at (7:35 - 7:42)
all so they don't want you to sleep (7:37 - 7:42)
well that's a good question no no that's (7:42 - 7:48)
not how sleep works you want all three (7:46 - 7:52)
parts of sleep in your sleep okay (7:48 - 7:56)
okay but the the calculation it does is (7:52 - 7:59)
it changes based on your average so if (7:56 - 8:01)
this type of sleep is higher than your (7:59 - 8:04)
average that's what it chooses okay got (8:01 - 8:07)
it okay and your average changes each (8:04 - 8:08)
night so theoretically that makes it (8:07 - 8:10)
more likely to get each of the three (8:08 - 8:12)
types of sleep I think snoozing is the (8:10 - 8:14)
one that I almost never get (8:12 - 8:17)
though well that's I think dozing is the (8:14 - 8:19)
one I never (8:17 - 8:21)
get I got snoozing this morning which I (8:19 - 8:23)
can't remember is Den snoozing or dozing (8:21 - 8:25)
CU it's not (8:23 - 8:28)
slumbering so I don't know I used an (8:25 - 8:31)
incense (8:28 - 8:33)
uh REO will have a new skill called (8:31 - 8:35)
helper boost so it's the only Pokemon (8:33 - 8:37)
that should have this skill for (8:35 - 8:40)
now uh and what it does is it the more (8:37 - 8:41)
different species of electric type (8:40 - 8:43)
pokemon on your team the greater the (8:41 - 8:47)
effect of the skill um so for example a (8:43 - 8:48)
team with five different electric type (8:47 - 8:52)
Pokemon raicho Raichu Den jolon (8:48 - 8:56)
Aeros uh but if that's five different (8:52 - 8:58)
species but a team with four different (8:56 - 9:00)
Pokemon would be raicho Raichu Raichu (8:58 - 9:03)
jol on Aeros so pretty much like two (9:00 - 9:06)
Raichu don't only one of your Raichu (9:03 - 9:09)
count there's like a TCG thing here too (9:06 - 9:11)
you can only have four cards in a deck (9:09 - 9:14)
but you can only have one a spec (9:11 - 9:16)
card I was fully expecting Steve to say (9:14 - 9:18)
like two Raichu don't make a wrong or (9:16 - 9:20)
something or two (9:18 - 9:23)
Raichu the Pikachu's (9:20 - 9:24)
though (9:23 - 9:27)
because I I I think we have to do the (9:24 - 9:28)
Deep dive cuz every time I go to the (9:27 - 9:31)
Pokemon go sleep subreddit like this (9:28 - 9:34)
question is asked a million times a day (9:31 - 9:35)
which at a certain point that subreddit (9:34 - 9:38)
ban Shiny Pokemon they should B they (9:35 - 9:41)
just just have a mega thread of like (9:38 - 9:43)
leading up to this week frequently asked (9:41 - 9:46)
questions constantly people were asking (9:43 - 9:49)
what about Pikachu with a hat they do (9:46 - 9:50)
they're different they are different so (9:49 - 9:53)
you can have Pikachu Pikachu with a (9:50 - 9:55)
witch hat Pikachu with a Santa hat those (9:53 - 9:57)
are three different (9:55 - 10:00)
Pikachus and then if you had a Pichu and (9:57 - 10:02)
a Pikachu that is different as (10:00 - 10:06)
well so there we (10:02 - 10:09)
go very I know complicated the special (10:06 - 10:11)
Pikachu that appears when you link your (10:09 - 10:17)
go Plus+ does not count towards the RICO (10:11 - 10:19)
which I I feel like that's unfair I paid (10:17 - 10:22)
60 something dollars for that thing he (10:19 - 10:25)
should count he has a different hat he (10:22 - 10:28)
has a snoozing cat that's (10:25 - 10:30)
true (10:28 - 10:32)
and then finally this is a new thing (10:30 - 10:35)
because riko is a special Pokemon I (10:32 - 10:37)
don't why don't they just say legendary (10:35 - 10:39)
uh you can only have one raicho on your (10:37 - 10:42)
team it is possible to get more than one (10:39 - 10:44)
special Pokemon but you cannot have more (10:42 - 10:46)
than one special Pokemon on the same (10:44 - 10:49)
team so my interpretation is you can't (10:46 - 10:52)
have raicho and ente on your team at the (10:49 - 10:53)
same (10:52 - 10:56)
time I don't know why you would because (10:53 - 10:57)
we're all assuming that ente is going to (10:56 - 11:01)
have the same power as r (10:57 - 11:04)
which would be for fire yeah (11:01 - 11:06)
yeah and then for special Pokemon the (11:04 - 11:10)
very first one you befriend will have (11:06 - 11:13)
the same nature and subskills for all (11:10 - 11:16)
researchers so it won't be (11:13 - 11:20)
randomized which I think is (11:16 - 11:22)
good (11:20 - 11:26)
yes we'll I (11:22 - 11:27)
mean yeah (11:26 - 11:30)
like like in our in our slack there was (11:27 - 11:31)
a bunch of people that got (11:30 - 11:35)
Den or multiple Den I only got one and (11:31 - 11:37)
it took me three encounters to get this (11:35 - 11:41)
Den um and mine was bad like I it's (11:37 - 11:44)
unusable when it gets to level 75 you (11:41 - 11:48)
get a little bit if I was to get it to (11:44 - 11:50)
level 75 that would be so much (11:48 - 11:53)
investment um but I I would imagine that (11:50 - 11:54)
it would be very like if you were a (11:53 - 11:56)
free-to-play player or like let's say (11:54 - 11:58)
six months down the line you finally get (11:56 - 12:02)
your raicho and it ends up just being (11:58 - 12:04)
terrible that would be that would be a (12:02 - 12:06)
pretty big turnoff so like every your (12:04 - 12:09)
very first raicho being like I I don't (12:06 - 12:11)
know if it's going to be like the most (12:09 - 12:12)
amaz we don't know what the sub skills (12:11 - 12:14)
are going to be but theoretically it'll (12:12 - 12:18)
be good it'll be good it'll be like fine (12:14 - 12:19)
and (12:18 - 12:22)
like are you even going to get a second (12:19 - 12:25)
chance for Rao like in a year and like (12:22 - 12:27)
oh I finally got a second REO it's like (12:25 - 12:28)
are you well are you one are you still (12:27 - 12:32)
playing two is this game still (12:28 - 12:32)
alive it can it be shiny do they say (12:32 - 12:37)
anything about that (12:35 - 12:39)
or I don't think they've said anything (12:37 - 12:41)
about it oh (12:39 - 12:44)
yeah there hasn't been a shiny lock in (12:41 - 12:48)
this game at all okay wait are you (12:44 - 12:49)
saying the raicho is bringing you back (12:48 - 12:51)
Bobby no I'm saying I'm I'm looking (12:49 - 12:54)
forward to the to the uh whatever (12:51 - 12:56)
screenshots I see on threads when REO (12:54 - 12:59)
comes out to see if it's shiny or not uh (12:56 - 13:01)
I that's a good question I didn't think (12:59 - 13:02)
about that but there there hasn't been a (13:01 - 13:05)
shiny lock in the game H interesting (13:02 - 13:07)
yeah I mean I still don't think I again (13:05 - 13:10)
my sleep schedule is awful I there's I (13:07 - 13:11)
don't have a reason to play this game (13:10 - 13:14)
like I mean to improve it I guess (13:11 - 13:16)
but a lot of the game isn't just the (13:14 - 13:19)
sleeping yeah I was going to say how (13:16 - 13:21)
much there's a lot of strategy how much (13:19 - 13:22)
of the game do you play while you're (13:21 - 13:24)
awake like how many hours a day do you (13:22 - 13:28)
think you invest in the game when you're (13:24 - 13:31)
awake uh let's see see uh well mon (13:28 - 13:32)
Monday is an exception cuz Monday you're (13:31 - 13:34)
setting up for the week so you're (13:32 - 13:36)
playing a lot more on Monday um but like (13:34 - 13:38)
when I wake up I'm probably (13:36 - 13:41)
spending I would say like 5 to 10 (13:38 - 13:43)
minutes in the app like you're you're (13:41 - 13:45)
you're going through your like okay who (13:43 - 13:49)
to catch do the catch thing feed (13:45 - 13:51)
breakfast collect all your berries maybe (13:49 - 13:53)
make any changes for the day and then I (13:51 - 13:55)
usually come back an hour or two for (13:53 - 13:57)
just to like check all the berries and (13:55 - 13:58)
then you come back for lunch and then (13:57 - 14:00)
you come back for dinner (13:58 - 14:03)
yeah open it a few times a day when you (14:00 - 14:04)
usually open it it's going to be 30 (14:03 - 14:07)
seconds to probably two minutes if (14:04 - 14:10)
you're doing a meal oh yeah wow the way (14:07 - 14:11)
you guys talked about it the way the way (14:10 - 14:13)
both of you talked about it made me feel (14:11 - 14:14)
like you were spending like a couple (14:13 - 14:17)
hours a day in this app no you want (14:14 - 14:20)
really optimize a team like I I spent (14:17 - 14:22)
probably a solid 15 minutes last night (14:20 - 14:25)
regoing through all my EES again cuz I (14:22 - 14:27)
have like seven EES and then being like (14:25 - 14:29)
are any of these good enough for Joel I (14:27 - 14:30)
don't know why just don't delete them I (14:29 - 14:32)
don't think they're good for any Pokemon (14:30 - 14:34)
but like I was like has any of these (14:32 - 14:35)
good for (14:34 - 14:38)
jolon but also like my electric week (14:35 - 14:40)
like I have an Aeros and I have a Raichu (14:38 - 14:42)
and they're both excellent like I'm very (14:40 - 14:44)
happy with them they're super super good (14:42 - 14:46)
and then it's like well I'm I don't have (14:44 - 14:48)
three more electric Pokemon like I could (14:46 - 14:50)
do a Pikachu or I could do a Pichu but (14:48 - 14:52)
they're not leveled up and they're not (14:50 - 14:55)
preferred because I evolved the good one (14:52 - 14:57)
into Raichu and then it's like well I (14:55 - 14:59)
wanted Den that would have been my third (14:57 - 15:04)
but the one To Deni I got was bad um and (14:59 - 15:06)
then it's like okay well magnet magnone (15:04 - 15:08)
doesn't count as an electric Pokemon in (15:06 - 15:10)
this game it counts as a steel (15:08 - 15:12)
Pokemon so I was like oh I'll just you (15:10 - 15:14)
know I'll just do M nope that don't (15:12 - 15:16)
count and then I (15:14 - 15:18)
was they just yeah no dual types in this (15:16 - 15:20)
game and then I was like oh I guess I'll (15:18 - 15:22)
just evolve an Eevee to a jolon so I'm (15:20 - 15:24)
like looking through all my jolon and (15:22 - 15:26)
then after I did that I'm like looking (15:24 - 15:27)
through all my other Pokemon it does (15:26 - 15:30)
have very much the Pokemon (15:27 - 15:31)
Inventory (15:30 - 15:33)
management (15:31 - 15:36)
yeah and running into some of the same (15:33 - 15:40)
issues where when my Pokemon box gets (15:36 - 15:43)
full there's so much work I want to put (15:40 - 15:44)
into to making sure I have the (15:43 - 15:47)
absolutely best Pokemon and I'm not (15:44 - 15:49)
getting rid of the Pokemon I don't I (15:47 - 15:51)
want to keep well it seems like there's (15:49 - 15:53)
a lot more well first off what are we (15:51 - 15:54)
talking what's full how many how many (15:53 - 15:56)
Pokemon we talking here I think they let (15:54 - 15:59)
you do 80 without ped mine so much (15:56 - 16:02)
okay cuz I got 6,000 in Pokemon go so (15:59 - 16:06)
just wondering full what full is here at (16:02 - 16:08)
sleep um I've upgraded mine a bunch with (16:06 - 16:10)
free gems I think I still haven't paid (16:08 - 16:14)
for any gems at all and I haven't been (16:10 - 16:17)
playing 100% consistently but I do catch (16:14 - 16:19)
a lot of Pokemon and I have a box that (16:17 - 16:23)
is 200 Max right now oh wow okay I only (16:19 - 16:28)
have 100 I'm I'm very like I I'm very (16:23 - 16:29)
like you're getting tossed like I don't (16:28 - 16:31)
need a living Dex I don't need like a (16:29 - 16:33)
like I don't I don't need like Steve (16:31 - 16:36)
only has 100 and Hannah's got 200 in (16:33 - 16:38)
Pokemon go you can at least like trade (16:36 - 16:41)
them or like move them to home or like (16:38 - 16:43)
yeah I just haven't done the Sorting (16:41 - 16:44)
there are so many that I haven't even (16:43 - 16:47)
looked at since I caught them yeah I try (16:44 - 16:48)
I that that is part of my routine I try (16:47 - 16:50)
to do the management right away like so (16:48 - 16:52)
when you catch a Pokemon you can like (16:50 - 16:54)
just like in Pokemon go you can inspect (16:52 - 16:56)
it right away mhm and if it if it's bad (16:54 - 16:58)
I I toss it immediately so I don't have (16:56 - 17:01)
this toss it immediately you have to go (16:58 - 17:03)
through the all the setting screens that (17:01 - 17:06)
take longer than I want them to so you (17:03 - 17:08)
have to dig through the settings just to (17:06 - 17:10)
transfer the Pokemon and that's that (17:08 - 17:12)
doesn't feel worth it first thing in the (17:10 - 17:14)
morning I I wish that you could transfer (17:12 - 17:18)
right on catch that would be great that (17:14 - 17:19)
it sounds like there's a lot more like (17:18 - 17:21)
if you if you let it go for a while and (17:19 - 17:23)
now you have seven EVs and now you have (17:21 - 17:25)
whatever it sounds like there's a lot (17:23 - 17:27)
more to go through to look and see if (17:25 - 17:30)
it's a good one versus like Pokémon go (17:27 - 17:32)
where it's really just based on IVs and (17:30 - 17:35)
now if it's like you know bigger or tiny (17:32 - 17:37)
or whatever but it sounds like with what (17:35 - 17:38)
you're all saying with the nature the (17:37 - 17:40)
sub the subskill all that stuff it (17:38 - 17:41)
sounds like there's a lot more to check (17:40 - 17:44)
if you're having to go through 10 or 12 (17:41 - 17:46)
of these to see which one to transfer (17:44 - 17:47)
yeah some would say there are (17:46 - 17:50)
calculators that help you figure out (17:47 - 17:52)
which of your Pokemon are (17:50 - 17:54)
good they're definitely if I put that to (17:52 - 17:56)
D in the calculator it's going to come (17:54 - 17:58)
back as like a C I'm sure have you even (17:56 - 17:59)
checked yet (17:58 - 18:02)
no I should I should uh that did Den is (17:59 - 18:04)
bad I don't like I don't like the (18:02 - 18:07)
experience up well I think a lot of (18:04 - 18:08)
people agree that experience up is like (18:07 - 18:10)
the worst one because once you get to (18:08 - 18:13)
100 that like benefit no longer benefits (18:10 - 18:16)
you whereas if it was experience down (18:13 - 18:19)
it's harder to get to 100 but there's no (18:16 - 18:21)
downside when you get to a 100 yeah (18:19 - 18:23)
exactly it's kind of just like the skill (18:21 - 18:27)
level up as the sub skill yeah which (18:23 - 18:28)
like some people like skill level up but (18:27 - 18:31)
like I don't mind skipping it because (18:28 - 18:33)
I'm a premium so I I can manually do it (18:31 - 18:36)
with gold it's it's very weird it's like (18:33 - 18:38)
I'm a (18:36 - 18:40)
premium but like if you're not a premium (18:38 - 18:42)
you have no way of buying gold skill (18:40 - 18:45)
seeds so well you could purchase them (18:42 - 18:47)
with like real money but like I get (18:45 - 18:48)
technically one of I don't think you (18:47 - 18:50)
even can well to be a premium you are (18:48 - 18:52)
using real money though right in the (18:50 - 18:53)
first place right right right no like (18:52 - 18:55)
premium like the gold skill seeds are (18:53 - 18:58)
sometimes in the bundles oh uh yes okay (18:55 - 19:01)
like a like a, 1500 gem bundle which is (18:58 - 19:01)
like (19:01 - 19:06)
$25 okay so raicho research will uh the (19:01 - 19:09)
event will start at 400 a.m on Monday (19:06 - 19:13)
the 25th and it will go until 4 (19:09 - 19:18)
a.m. Monday the April 8th on green grass (19:13 - 19:19)
legendary Pokemon raicho will appear for (19:18 - 19:21)
the first time it's a two- week (19:19 - 19:23)
opportunity uh to concentrate on (19:21 - 19:26)
Research during this event you will you (19:23 - 19:29)
will collect samples of riko Maine the (19:26 - 19:31)
main of aicho and you will exchange that (19:29 - 19:33)
via the event exchange for items such as (19:31 - 19:36)
aicho incense or raicho (19:33 - 19:39)
biscuits you can use the raicho incense (19:36 - 19:41)
to research raicho of various sleep (19:39 - 19:44)
Styles even without the raicho incense (19:41 - 19:47)
incense raicho may still appear during (19:44 - 19:49)
sleep research but extremely rare for (19:47 - 19:51)
researchers who would like to befriend (19:49 - 19:53)
raicho that means catch we recommend (19:51 - 19:55)
using raicho biscuits they're they're (19:53 - 19:58)
specialized for use with only raicho (19:55 - 20:00)
also electric type helper Pokémon will (19:58 - 20:02)
be helpful electric type helper Pokemon (20:00 - 20:05)
including Pikachu Raichu jolon raicho (20:02 - 20:09)
Pichu flaffy Marie Aeros and (20:05 - 20:12)
den um in addition you'll be able to (20:09 - 20:13)
encounter different Pokemon with (20:12 - 20:15)
different sleep Styles regardless of (20:13 - 20:18)
your own electric type Pokemon will have (20:15 - 20:21)
a greater appearance during this event (20:18 - 20:23)
you will get two sets of limited (20:21 - 20:27)
missions week one Mission and week two (20:23 - 20:28)
uh week one will start when you're (20:27 - 20:30)
listening sorry week one will start on (20:28 - 20:33)
the 25th and then week two will start on (20:30 - 20:36)
April 1st those missions will let you (20:33 - 20:39)
earn raicho (20:36 - 20:41)
Mains there will also be an exchange (20:39 - 20:44)
period in the shop you can exchange for (20:41 - 20:46)
the following items raicho incense (20:44 - 20:48)
raicho biscuit main skill seed (20:46 - 20:50)
thunderstorm Thunderstone that's that's (20:48 - 20:51)
going to be a purchased (20:50 - 20:56)
one I believe um what is a raicho (20:51 - 20:58)
incense a raicho incense uh makes raicho (20:56 - 20:59)
appear (20:58 - 21:01)
uh you put it on the (20:59 - 21:03)
slump okay there's nothing new here that (21:01 - 21:06)
we don't know what is a raicho biscuit (21:03 - 21:08)
uh these can be used during sleep (21:06 - 21:11)
research with the event period and only (21:08 - 21:14)
with raicho one raicho biscuit will (21:11 - 21:16)
increase reiko's friendship by six (21:14 - 21:19)
points um so I'm assuming if raicho is (21:16 - 21:22)
hungry which not guaranteed to be (21:19 - 21:26)
hungry that would be (21:22 - 21:26)
18 oh (21:27 - 21:33)
we we don't know it's final tally so if (21:29 - 21:35)
it's final tally special Pokemon it's if (21:33 - 21:38)
it's final tally is like 20 there's no (21:35 - 21:41)
way it's not like more than 20 (21:38 - 21:45)
right it has to be I think because the (21:41 - 21:47)
den is we just talked about the Deni (21:45 - 21:49)
being 16 yeah that gets you to 12 and (21:47 - 21:51)
there's no way to go from (21:49 - 21:56)
12 to 16 did 18 I can't remember there's (21:51 - 21:57)
just no way to do it without it the (21:56 - 22:01)
chance of it being full (21:57 - 22:01)
um it's a lot there's a lot to this game (22:03 - 22:08)
a lot more than this game that I thought (22:06 - 22:09)
it was just you go to sleep you wake up (22:08 - 22:11)
Pikachu sings you a alabi and you you (22:09 - 22:14)
know catch a Pokemon like there's a (22:11 - 22:17)
whole bunch and now it's sort of sort of (22:14 - 22:21)
a little bit making me want to maybe (22:17 - 22:22)
there's like no there's nothing in (22:21 - 22:26)
Pokemon go that is this extreme no I (22:22 - 22:29)
there really isn't not not to the what (22:26 - 22:33)
you've just been talking about is not (22:29 - 22:35)
like maybe like when me first got (22:33 - 22:38)
introduced yeah when megas were first (22:35 - 22:41)
getting introduced and even almost still (22:38 - 22:43)
with the megas because if you're if you (22:41 - 22:45)
need to walk for Mega Energy but that (22:43 - 22:47)
only happens after you've mega evolved (22:45 - 22:49)
it once I'm trying to yeah I am trying (22:47 - 22:52)
to come up with something because they (22:49 - 22:55)
have been adding complicated stuff to go (22:52 - 22:58)
I I mean I will say that in go the when (22:55 - 23:00)
you get to the uh the researches that (22:58 - 23:03)
lead to shiny mythicals are timec (23:00 - 23:07)
consuming and take you know get 10 best (23:03 - 23:10)
buddies then catch 10 keeleon then you (23:07 - 23:12)
can tell I'm on the Gerra one still uh (23:10 - 23:15)
then you know catch 385 of all these and (23:12 - 23:18)
excellent throws 385 excellent throws uh (23:15 - 23:19)
um still two best buddies away from that (23:18 - 23:21)
10 and I play Go (23:19 - 23:24)
daily just don't do the Buddy thing very (23:21 - 23:28)
often um but yeah no nothing seems as as (23:24 - 23:30)
complicated honestly has this REO sleep (23:28 - 23:33)
research thing yeah I think this is also (23:30 - 23:35)
throwing people up and I had to read (23:33 - 23:37)
this like two times so they they put out (23:35 - 23:41)
a four-part infographic to catcho and (23:37 - 23:44)
the first one which was posted on March (23:41 - 23:46)
12th they didn't post them at the same (23:44 - 23:49)
time no they posted them (23:46 - 23:53)
daily which I think led to more (23:49 - 23:56)
questions this is the road map to Reiko (23:53 - 23:58)
research step one get ready it is (23:56 - 24:01)
recommended to use electric type Pokemon (23:58 - 24:02)
um electric type Pokemon will get you (24:01 - 24:03)
more (24:02 - 24:06)
ingredients the main skill trigger will (24:03 - 24:09)
be multiplied by 1.5 and grepa berries (24:06 - 24:11)
which is the berry that electric Pokemon (24:09 - 24:13)
gather will be set as snorlax's (24:11 - 24:15)
favorites and it says each bonus can be (24:13 - 24:17)
triggered on green grass be careful when (24:15 - 24:18)
changing (24:17 - 24:20)
Islands I think a lot of people think (24:18 - 24:22)
they have to go to green grass this week (24:20 - 24:25)
but again this doesn't start until the (24:22 - 24:29)
25th so but there the there's nothing (24:25 - 24:32)
step one is to get ready for the 25th (24:29 - 24:34)
essentially so that's what step one is (24:32 - 24:37)
to do stuff this week to get ready for (24:34 - 24:38)
technically the week we're just ending (24:37 - 24:41)
on sure this last week was electric week (24:38 - 24:43)
right but this week is not that that's (24:41 - 24:45)
what's really confusing is that the last (24:43 - 24:47)
week was electric week but then this (24:45 - 24:50)
week is just a regular week and then (24:47 - 24:53)
it's Reiko next week yes am I correct on (24:50 - 24:55)
that Hannah there's nothing this week (24:53 - 24:58)
happening yeah yeah no this week starts (24:55 - 25:01)
on the 18th but nothing with Raichu (24:58 - 25:04)
starts until the 25th okay so then next (25:01 - 25:06)
question is there more to gather this (25:04 - 25:08)
week that will help with raicho next (25:06 - 25:11)
week I would assume this week is the (25:08 - 25:13)
like level up your electric Pokemon that (25:11 - 25:16)
you caught cuz Okay I I I think I don't (25:13 - 25:18)
think it's bad like I think they're like (25:16 - 25:19)
well if you just caught a Marie and a p (25:18 - 25:21)
Pikachu and now all of a sudden on (25:19 - 25:23)
Monday you got to go in yeah like I (25:21 - 25:25)
think they're giving us a week to (25:23 - 25:28)
like get the we've had the candy boost (25:25 - 25:30)
bonus this past week so that Pichu I (25:28 - 25:32)
caught is already one of my strongest (25:30 - 25:35)
Pokemon (25:32 - 25:35)
now uh so that was the first okay golden (25:35 - 25:42)
go in Pokemon go getting a golden go in (25:39 - 25:46)
Pokemon go is this complicated okay yeah (25:42 - 25:48)
that's true what I don't have in Pokemon (25:46 - 25:51)
go is give me ghl or golden go so there (25:48 - 25:54)
you go I I got it got it you you don't (25:51 - 25:55)
but you have scarlet and violet you can (25:54 - 25:57)
get it pretty easy oh I totally could (25:55 - 25:59)
yeah but you have to know all of the (25:57 - 26:02)
steps and you to do all of the steps (25:59 - 26:03)
repeatedly Steve I still haven't (26:02 - 26:05)
downloaded the pomat that you gave a (26:03 - 26:08)
code that you showed the code for that I (26:05 - 26:10)
think I po I reposted on my own (26:08 - 26:12)
Instagram story and I still don't (26:10 - 26:14)
haven't downloaded that (26:12 - 26:16)
yet (26:14 - 26:19)
so there was somebody at uh La that were (26:16 - 26:22)
like oh do you want a gimme ghoul like (26:19 - 26:23)
that was what they were offering me and (26:22 - 26:26)
I was like this is rare I a million of (26:23 - 26:27)
these to some people it is to some (26:26 - 26:29)
people yeah well if you don't have (26:27 - 26:31)
scarlet and violet right then that was (26:29 - 26:33)
like meltan initially when it was only (26:31 - 26:35)
with let's go and not with home before (26:33 - 26:38)
home came out right meltam was like yep (26:35 - 26:39)
you know if you didn't have it you know (26:38 - 26:42)
it was you know pay to remember offering (26:39 - 26:45)
my 3DS to as momentary use to the other (26:42 - 26:48)
players on my college campus bring yep (26:45 - 26:49)
bring mine to work to get people who (26:48 - 26:51)
didn't have it yeah EXA so same kind of (26:49 - 26:55)
thing okay so step two collect raicho (26:51 - 26:58)
Mains the number of samples you obtain (26:55 - 26:59)
depending on the the variety of sleep (26:58 - 27:00)
Styles you find the rarer the Sleep (26:59 - 27:03)
Styles the more you get so you're (27:00 - 27:07)
getting raicho main from electric type (27:03 - 27:10)
Pokemon that are sleeping when you wake (27:07 - 27:13)
up so I think I saw this in the slack I (27:10 - 27:15)
think this was yarney they said that (27:13 - 27:18)
they were saving their electric incense (27:15 - 27:21)
for this upcoming week because it forces (27:18 - 27:23)
an electric (27:21 - 27:25)
spawn that's right which is actually (27:23 - 27:27)
really clever yep because I used both my (27:25 - 27:30)
Den incenses as soon as I got them I was (27:27 - 27:32)
like I but my thought process was I want (27:30 - 27:35)
to get the den ready going into electric (27:32 - 27:37)
week and then you got the den that you (27:35 - 27:40)
got yeah then yours is unusable and I (27:37 - 27:42)
got a garbage (27:40 - 27:45)
Den uh alternative ways to collect (27:42 - 27:47)
raicho Mains complete limited time (27:45 - 27:49)
research raicho research Last Chance (27:47 - 27:51)
bundles so you can you'll be able to buy (27:49 - 27:55)
raicho main this is great for you Bobby (27:51 - 27:57)
you can just buy the thing you need and (27:55 - 27:59)
it's not that cheap either (27:57 - 28:01)
in rare cases you can obtain a sample of (27:59 - 28:05)
raicho M from other researchers on your (28:01 - 28:06)
community who are participating in the (28:05 - 28:08)
event this is like a big thing in (28:06 - 28:11)
Pokemon sleep that like I it's also a (28:08 - 28:13)
big thing in Pokemon go where people are (28:11 - 28:14)
like oh it's so hard to level up in (28:13 - 28:17)
Pokemon go and it's like just add people (28:14 - 28:19)
and open gifts and that free friendship (28:17 - 28:22)
is really like so much experience but in (28:19 - 28:25)
Pokemon sleep you want your friends list (28:22 - 28:28)

every morning you're getting one to two (28:28 - 28:32)
pieces of candy from every single friend (28:30 - 28:34)
so if Bobby if you researched a (28:32 - 28:37)
Bulbasaur and I researched a Marie you (28:34 - 28:39)

both sides do or like just me so if (28:49 - 28:53)
Steve's my friend I can just go into the (28:51 - 28:54)
menu and I get a free I'm going to get a (28:53 - 28:56)
free Marie candy all you do is you open (28:54 - 28:58)
your friends list and it'll say like 37 (28:56 - 29:00)
friends have finished sleeping and then (28:58 - 29:04)

all right I might try this out again I (29:04 - 29:08)
already got the go Plus+ and everything (29:06 - 29:11)
I might as well (29:08 - 29:14)
just uh okay so that was part two don't (29:11 - 29:16)
worry we're 30 minutes into the show and (29:14 - 29:18)
we're still working through how riko (29:16 - 29:19)
[Laughter] (29:18 - 29:22)
works all right part (29:19 - 29:25)
three this is the the raicho main part (29:22 - 29:26)
right (29:25 - 29:30)
okay uh get raicho biscuits raicho (29:26 - 29:32)
biscuits are important item that (29:30 - 29:34)
increases friendships you can trade (29:32 - 29:36)
raicho Main in the event exchange for (29:34 - 29:39)
new items one raicho biscuit increases (29:36 - 29:42)
reiko's friendship by six you can also (29:39 - 29:44)
increase reiko's friendships with Pokey (29:42 - 29:46)
biscuits and others that makes it assume (29:44 - 29:48)
that like the master ball just works or (29:46 - 29:50)
the master ball biscuit works right I (29:48 - 29:51)
don't know why it wouldn't work that's (29:50 - 29:53)
what it sounds (29:51 - 29:57)
like after the (29:53 - 30:01)
so I mean I would have two if I had one (29:57 - 30:04)
uh after the event Exchange closes any (30:01 - 30:05)
raicho biscuits you have will (30:04 - 30:07)
automatically be turned into great (30:05 - 30:09)
biscuits which actually is not bad (30:07 - 30:10)
greate biscuits (30:09 - 30:13)
are not easy to come by technically even (30:10 - 30:15)
in the premium store I think I can only (30:13 - 30:18)
buy five grape biscuits a month yeah I (30:15 - 30:21)
can't get grape biscuits as a free (30:18 - 30:23)
player when do they turn into great (30:21 - 30:25)
biscuits because if you after the whole (30:23 - 30:28)
event is over so after like April 8th (30:25 - 30:31)
but they said raicho can still appear (30:28 - 30:33)
after the event is over but they're like (30:31 - 30:34)
no no no raicho biscuits for you after (30:33 - 30:36)
the (30:34 - 30:39)
event yeah this is an event limited very (30:36 - 30:44)
complicated mechanic got right okay uh (30:39 - 30:45)
so I got to start playing this week (30:44 - 30:48)
wonderful no no you got prep you prepped (30:45 - 30:50)
this week Bobby no it's a prep I know (30:48 - 30:51)
because Rao not till next week let's (30:50 - 30:54)
clarify that not right right you don't (30:51 - 30:56)
have to go to green grass this week it's (30:54 - 30:59)
what I'm saying (30:56 - 31:02)
you are safe to move somewhere um part (30:59 - 31:05)
four Mains can also be exchanged for an (31:02 - 31:08)
incense but you can only hold one in (31:05 - 31:11)
your bag at a time uh and then you'll (31:08 - 31:13)
know obviously if you use an incense the (31:11 - 31:14)
night before that you will for sure get (31:13 - 31:17)
raicho the next day so maybe don't do (31:14 - 31:20)
that if you have no raicho biscuits no (31:17 - 31:24)
master ball (31:20 - 31:24)
maybe maybe be very cautious on your (31:25 - 31:29)
incense (31:27 - 31:31)
I forgot to ask a sorry really important (31:29 - 31:35)
question a master ball biscuit right is (31:31 - 31:37)
that what it's called okay is that does (31:35 - 31:39)
that guarantee a catch or does that (31:37 - 31:42)
guarantee a to befriend you like it has (31:39 - 31:46)
so far okay yeah so far well okay we (31:42 - 31:50)
don't know with Raichu yet not for sure (31:46 - 31:51)
there when when sometimes when you like (31:50 - 31:54)
give a Pokeball to uh Pokemon even if it (31:51 - 31:57)
was like a den which has 18 ticks or (31:54 - 31:59)
whatever (31:57 - 32:00)
sometimes it'll like critical hit and (31:59 - 32:03)
then a huge heart will appear over its (32:00 - 32:06)
head and then it fills the whole bar (32:03 - 32:10)
okay which is awesome um and nine times (32:06 - 32:11)
out of 10 when most people get a (32:10 - 32:13)
critical hit it's like when the like you (32:11 - 32:16)
have one tick left you have almost none (32:13 - 32:17)
left yeah and then you like go to like (32:16 - 32:19)
give it the biscuit and like Critical (32:17 - 32:21)
Hits and you're like I don't E I didn't (32:19 - 32:24)
eat this at (32:21 - 32:24)
all um but the master ball (32:25 - 32:32)
Critical Hits apparent it should fill (32:29 - 32:34)
the whole thing right like there it (32:32 - 32:35)
shouldn't I I don't see why it would be (32:34 - 32:37)
very weird if the master ball did not (32:35 - 32:39)
catch raicho in one the other thing too (32:37 - 32:42)
is like um if it's shiny it's a (32:39 - 32:45)
guaranteed critical hit so even if you (32:42 - 32:49)
got like a shiny te if if everything (32:45 - 32:51)
works the same if you've got a shiny (32:49 - 32:52)
raicho which we don't even know if is (32:51 - 32:55)
possible and you were to give it one (32:52 - 32:58)
Pokeball it should Auto catch because (32:55 - 33:00)
like no matter how many ticks it has a (32:58 - 33:02)
shiny is always autoc catch on one (33:00 - 33:03)
Pokeball you don't have to use a master (33:02 - 33:07)
ball on a shiny which is guaranteed okay (33:03 - 33:11)
which is like super nice right so (33:07 - 33:14)
D all right sorry I'm (33:11 - 33:16)
like let going back to basics for a (33:14 - 33:17)
second so like you're either going to (33:16 - 33:19)
befriend a Pokemon that's like the (33:17 - 33:22)
equivalent of catching one or it's not (33:19 - 33:25)
going to do that right and so do is it (33:22 - 33:27)
possible for Shiny Pokemon to like (33:25 - 33:29)
essentially run away like quote unquote (33:27 - 33:34)
like or is it don't try to catch them oh (33:29 - 33:35)
sure but I mean if you do if you give it (33:34 - 33:37)
a biscuit then it's going to befriend (33:35 - 33:39)
you is what you're saying 100% yeah no (33:37 - 33:41)
matter what biscuit you give it so I (33:39 - 33:43)
mean like I think the very first week a (33:41 - 33:45)
lot of people because the game kind of (33:43 - 33:46)
forces you to buy a master ball when you (33:45 - 33:48)
first like go through the (33:46 - 33:50)
tutorial um I don't know if there's a (33:48 - 33:52)
way to like not buy it but I think most (33:50 - 33:54)
people bought the master ball because it (33:52 - 33:57)
like kind of tells you too but I I do (33:54 - 33:59)
remember the first two weeks of the game (33:57 - 34:00)
people would see a shiny and then they (33:59 - 34:01)
would give it the master ball because (34:00 - 34:03)
they were worried about it running away (34:01 - 34:05)
and of course we we found out that like (34:03 - 34:08)
we one brave soul was like I'll Pokeball (34:05 - 34:13)
this shiny for Science and then was like (34:08 - 34:14)
oh did you get lucky and just get a (34:13 - 34:16)
critical hit and then we figured out (34:14 - 34:19)
that no Chinese are just guaranteed (34:16 - 34:21)
catches a second brave soul also had to (34:19 - 34:23)
Pokeball biscuit (34:21 - 34:26)
there so yeah it's just like in Pokemon (34:23 - 34:27)
go where if you don't catch then the (34:26 - 34:29)
other people people get an increased (34:27 - 34:31)
catch do you remember that rumor in (34:29 - 34:35)
Pokemon go no one catch the catch until (34:31 - 34:38)
we all click and make sure that we get (34:35 - 34:41)
the shiny first yeah that was that was (34:38 - 34:43)
times no it's not like that we we know (34:41 - 34:47)
for sure that shinies are 100% catch but (34:43 - 34:49)
we again we don't know if Rao could be (34:47 - 34:51)
shiny there has never been a shiny lock (34:49 - 34:54)
in this game so assuming it can be shiny (34:51 - 34:56)
but when they first legendary Right (34:54 - 34:58)
first legendary they did they also said (34:56 - 35:00)
like the first legendary will be the (34:58 - 35:01)
same for everyone with nature and (35:00 - 35:05)
subskills right so are they also saying (35:01 - 35:08)
not shiny for everyone too lock shiny (35:05 - 35:09)
lock maybe I could see that being the (35:08 - 35:12)
case well then I'm then I'm deleting (35:09 - 35:13)
this app that I just downloaded never (35:12 - 35:16)
mind just kiding just (35:13 - 35:20)
kidding um so I I think I think that is (35:16 - 35:23)
everything for REO you have to be on (35:20 - 35:26)
green grass you got to be using electric (35:23 - 35:28)
Pokemon there you don't have to be on (35:26 - 35:30)
green grass this week although you (35:28 - 35:32)
probably already picked your map if (35:30 - 35:33)
you're listening to the Sun (35:32 - 35:36)
bunde and electric week is (35:33 - 35:39)
over and you got me to download the game (35:36 - 35:42)
so it is now on my phone currently it's (35:39 - 35:46)
a fun game when you have good enough (35:42 - 35:48)
Pokemon yeah um that pachu really (35:46 - 35:49)
brought me (35:48 - 35:51)
back that's p and there was there was a (35:49 - 35:54)
free bundle there was a growth focus and (35:51 - 35:56)
five Pokey biscuit bundle to celebrate (35:54 - 35:59)
World sleep day and then this upcoming (35:56 - 36:01)
week is good (35:59 - 36:05)
sleep week or good sleep day which I (36:01 - 36:07)
think is Friday Saturday (36:05 - 36:10)
Sunday I think technically it's Saturday (36:07 - 36:11)
into Sunday is the good night and then (36:10 - 36:14)
Friday into Saturday is the half bonus (36:11 - 36:17)
and then Saturday Sunday and Monday is (36:14 - 36:19)
the half (36:17 - 36:21)
bonus I think and then Den is (36:19 - 36:24)
permanently in the game (36:21 - 36:27)
now um and yes I did very yes electric (36:24 - 36:31)
type is over so nothing happening this (36:27 - 36:33)
week for REO you have to be on green (36:31 - 36:36)
grass technically for two weeks and we (36:33 - 36:37)
were just on green grass a lot of people (36:36 - 36:39)
were just on green grass for electric (36:37 - 36:42)
week so please use this opportunity to (36:39 - 36:44)
maybe take a break from Green (36:42 - 36:47)
Grass I'm gonna go back to lapis because (36:44 - 36:49)
I hate (36:47 - 36:49)
myself I'm kind of surprised you weren't (36:50 - 36:57)
on lapis for electric week uh I almost (36:52 - 36:58)
did (36:57 - 37:02)
um and I I it took me it's it still (36:58 - 37:04)
takes me really long to get to Ultra (37:02 - 37:09)
Ball MH and I was like ah and I thought (37:04 - 37:10)
I'd be able to see like I'm master ball (37:09 - 37:13)
14 now on Green (37:10 - 37:15)
Grass and I thought I would be able to (37:13 - 37:18)
see more to den because of how like (37:15 - 37:19)
there's like a science to how like (37:18 - 37:22)
snorlax's like drowsy power breaks into (37:19 - 37:27)
like specific Pokemon yeah and so like (37:22 - 37:29)
the higher number is is better when you (37:27 - 37:31)
want a Pokemon like Den or Absol which (37:29 - 37:35)
use a lot of snorlax's (37:31 - 37:37)
power I think that's it for Pokemon (37:35 - 37:40)
sleep we did it 35 minutes later you are (37:37 - 37:44)
now prepared for REO week all right uh (37:40 - 37:45)
let's take a break and we come back (37:44 - 37:46)
we're going to talk about Pokemon go and (37:45 - 37:49)
TCG and we've accomplished Bobby (37:46 - 37:52)
downloading the app again so yeah good (37:49 - 37:56)
successful segment we'll be right (37:52 - 37:56)
back (37:56 - 38:09)
[Music] (37:58 - 38:12)
and we are back from our (38:09 - 38:15)
break uh let's do some TCG stuff before (38:12 - 38:20)
we get to the Pokemon Go stuff okay so (38:15 - 38:23)
uh temp temporal (38:20 - 38:27)
forces arrives on March 22nd which is (38:23 - 38:32)
the next TCG set over 160 cards uh they (38:27 - 38:34)
already had like pre-releases and stuff (38:32 - 38:37)
for that um Pokemon company just (38:34 - 38:39)
disclosure Pokemon company sent me a box (38:37 - 38:41)
of cards I have I haven't even opened (38:39 - 38:43)
the box to the box of cards yet I'll (38:41 - 38:44)
probably do that on Twitch later this (38:43 - 38:51)
week um I have I I I feel like I'm not (38:44 - 38:54)
into cards as much as I was during sword (38:51 - 38:56)
and shield and it's not because like (38:54 - 38:58)
they changed the borders or they changed (38:56 - 39:01)
the rare rates uh I think it was just (38:58 - 39:05)
like burnout of like actively trying to (39:01 - 39:07)
collect all the sword and shield cards (39:05 - 39:09)
and being like this is (39:07 - 39:13)
impossible yeah um it's like actually (39:09 - 39:15)
impossible to collect everything without (39:13 - 39:18)
like dropping even more money on top of (39:15 - 39:21)
that uh (39:18 - 39:24)
but Bobby tell us tell us about temp is (39:21 - 39:25)
are people excited about this set (39:24 - 39:27)
there's no Charizard in the set right (39:25 - 39:29)
there's no Charizard in this Set uh what (39:27 - 39:33)
is in this set are uh all of the Paradox (39:29 - 39:37)
Pokemon that were released uh with the (39:33 - 39:42)
DLC so the uh legendary beasts like the (39:37 - 39:45)
Paradox version of those um so walking (39:42 - 39:50)
wake um and Goring fire yeah ging fire (39:45 - 39:54)
and um uh raging bolts as well as iron (39:50 - 39:57)
Crown iron leaves and iron Boulder so (39:54 - 40:00)
those are the um they're in the set all (39:57 - 40:02)
six of them are in the set they have (40:00 - 40:04)
full arts they have special illustration (40:02 - 40:05)
rares so people are kind of excited (40:04 - 40:07)
about those um a lot of there's some (40:05 - 40:09)
other Paradox Pokemon that hadn't shown (40:07 - 40:12)
up yet um they are in the set like iron (40:09 - 40:15)
Thorns um is in there as well so people (40:12 - 40:16)
are excited about that there's also the (40:15 - 40:20)
return of Ace spec cards which have not (40:16 - 40:22)
been seen in the TCG since the black and (40:20 - 40:25)
white era so remember a back yeah they (40:22 - 40:30)
are uh very very power powerful um uh (40:25 - 40:33)
cards and you can only use one per deck (40:30 - 40:35)
so there are I believe there are four of (40:33 - 40:37)
them in this set um you can only have (40:35 - 40:39)
one in your deck not one of each but (40:37 - 40:42)
like one asec card at all can be in your (40:39 - 40:45)
deck when playing um similar to like (40:42 - 40:46)
radiant with radiant Pokemon back in (40:45 - 40:48)
sword and shield you could only have one (40:46 - 40:51)
of those in your deck um so with asec (40:48 - 40:54)
one of those uh and other than that I (40:51 - 40:57)
think there's a lot of playable cards um (40:54 - 41:01)
in this deck so people um on both on the (40:57 - 41:04)
collection side and on the uh player (41:01 - 41:07)
side are pretty excited about this set (41:04 - 41:11)
um but it is a yeah I think there are (41:07 - 41:14)
218 cards I want to say total um with (41:11 - 41:16)
all the secret rares that's what Buble (41:14 - 41:20)
pedia is saying yeah so it's uh you know (41:16 - 41:24)
it's it's not nearly as big a set as uh (41:20 - 41:26)
the last few I I want to I I think I (41:24 - 41:27)
heard it's like maybe one of the (41:26 - 41:29)
smallest sets since battle Styles which (41:27 - 41:33)
is 216 is a small set oh gosh look at (41:29 - 41:35)
the like I mean Pala evolved was like (41:33 - 41:37)
280 or something like even obsidian (41:35 - 41:39)
Flames which is considered a smaller set (41:37 - 41:43)
was like 230 palan Fates were 245 pal (41:39 - 41:46)
and f p and fat CU all those shinies so (41:43 - 41:48)
that was Paradox riff was (41:46 - 41:52)
266 yeah 151 was (41:48 - 41:55)
207 oh well that was a yeah so this is (41:52 - 41:57)
the first regular was special set (41:55 - 41:59)
regular set that has that's small that's (41:57 - 42:02)
you know smaller smaller in 218 cards (41:59 - 42:04)
but uh I have the same feeling as Steve (42:02 - 42:07)
with the collection of when the sword (42:04 - 42:09)
and shield era was out I was just trying (42:07 - 42:10)
to collect everything and I was like oh (42:09 - 42:12)
I'm just going to try to collect every (42:10 - 42:14)
set and everything like that and it (42:12 - 42:16)
quickly was like no you have to spend a (42:14 - 42:19)
ridiculous amount of money to collect an (42:16 - 42:22)
entire set and so I restructured my (42:19 - 42:24)
entire collection ways with Scarlet (42:22 - 42:28)
Violet era to like just specific subsets (42:24 - 42:29)
within the sets of what I want to (42:28 - 42:32)
collect so that it's not so daunting or (42:29 - 42:34)
I don't feel like it's like well I have (42:32 - 42:37)
to you know buy four or five booster (42:34 - 42:39)
boxes so I can collect this entire set (42:37 - 42:41)
so um I think that's kept me in it a (42:39 - 42:43)
little bit more whereas like I'm not I (42:41 - 42:44)
don't feel like I have to try to collect (42:43 - 42:47)
everything now this where I feel like (42:44 - 42:48)
pocket comes (42:47 - 42:53)
in yes exactly right absolutely that (42:48 - 42:54)
yeah that'll be that'll be interesting (42:53 - 42:57)
when that when that comes through but um (42:54 - 43:00)
but yeah so temporal forces uh yeah this (42:57 - 43:02)
Friday and people seem excited about it (43:00 - 43:04)
I mean it's uh we haven't had a regular (43:02 - 43:06)
set since Paradox Rift and that was (43:04 - 43:09)
November so um and you know one thing to (43:06 - 43:11)
remember because this always happens (43:09 - 43:14)
every time uh paldan Fates spoiled (43:11 - 43:16)
people because you would get so many (43:14 - 43:19)
hits in palan Fates like because of the (43:16 - 43:22)
baby shinies and all of that and so like (43:19 - 43:24)
you'd open up like a booster bundle (43:22 - 43:26)
which was six packs and you'd get like (43:24 - 43:28)
four or five hits and people will go (43:26 - 43:30)
back to a regular set like temporal (43:28 - 43:32)
forces they'll get a booster bundle of (43:30 - 43:35)
six packs and they'll get like two hits (43:32 - 43:36)
and they'll be like you know they're (43:35 - 43:38)
going to be like what this is ridiculous (43:36 - 43:41)
like pal and Fates yeah it those special (43:38 - 43:44)
sets they spoil you on the hits uh so (43:41 - 43:46)
just remember that going back to a (43:44 - 43:48)
regular set it's going to be more like (43:46 - 43:51)
Paradox Rift or obsidian Flames than pal (43:48 - 43:54)
day and Fates when it comes to the hit (43:51 - 43:58)
rate and then the company was like hey (43:54 - 44:00)
before this new set comes out there's (43:58 - 44:03)
another new set coming yeah which I do (44:00 - 44:06)
think like is kind of weird marketing (44:03 - 44:07)
they do this all the time this is like (44:06 - 44:09)
not new but it's it is really weird when (44:07 - 44:12)
it comes to the TCG stuff to like Market (44:09 - 44:16)
your new set in four months two weeks (44:12 - 44:19)
before your or a week before your (44:16 - 44:22)
current set is about to drop MH um but (44:19 - 44:24)
the this is called Twilight (44:22 - 44:27)
masquerade I think I said that right mhm (44:24 - 44:32)
uh which is uh launching on May (44:27 - 44:36)
24th uh this year over 160 cards that's (44:32 - 44:38)
they don't ever count Secret rares in (44:36 - 44:39)
that so it'll probably be what probably (44:38 - 44:42)
closer to 200 because there's like 40 (44:39 - 44:44)
Secret rares at this point they release (44:42 - 44:46)
these things yeah there's a lot in this (44:44 - 44:48)
one actually in this set um and this (44:46 - 44:51)
will have uh this will have the debut of (44:48 - 44:55)
ogre Pon she's a queen uh we'll see four (44:51 - 44:57)
different ogre Pon EXs which is teal Mas (44:55 - 45:00)
ogre Pond Wellspring mask hear flame (44:57 - 45:03)
mask and then Cornerstone mask and then (45:00 - 45:07)
there will also be an ogre's mask item (45:03 - 45:09)
which will which will be able to be (45:07 - 45:11)
playable on all four of those that I (45:09 - 45:12)
just talked (45:11 - 45:16)
about so yeah I'm looking at the list (45:12 - 45:18)
right now it looks like 167 cards before (45:16 - 45:20)
secret rares but it's looking like (45:18 - 45:24)
another 50 secret rares how how can a (45:20 - 45:27)
card be a secret rare how can one one (45:24 - 45:30)
fourth of your set be secret rares I (45:27 - 45:32)
know right well I I appreciate that in (45:30 - 45:34)
this Scarlet Violet era they did do the (45:32 - 45:38)
thing now where everything that is not (45:34 - 45:42)
just the regular cards or like an ex um (45:38 - 45:46)
is passed the set number so if you look (45:42 - 45:47)
at the bottom left corner of a card (45:46 - 45:51)
it'll say like out of 167 but then all (45:47 - 45:52)
the illustration rares all the special (45:51 - 45:54)
illustration rares that number will be (45:52 - 45:57)
higher than 167 so like yeah whereas (45:54 - 46:00)
before it was only like the gold cards (45:57 - 46:01)
that would be above that number they (46:00 - 46:03)
were the only secret rares so you would (46:01 - 46:04)
have like two secret rares five Secret (46:03 - 46:07)
rares in a set and now they're like oh (46:04 - 46:09)
all the other cards are are secret rares (46:07 - 46:10)
so it's now it's like 50 secret rares (46:09 - 46:14)
per set and so uh back in my day we we (46:10 - 46:17)
had two secret rares it was a gold rush (46:14 - 46:20)
ram and a gold Ze back in the XY day (46:17 - 46:22)
right you literally had like one extra (46:20 - 46:24)
card it was just like oh and this is the (46:22 - 46:27)
secret rare of the set right this is the (46:24 - 46:29)
one Gold Card we're putting out this (46:27 - 46:32)
this three months um but I think part of (46:29 - 46:34)
it is well one thing that's interesting (46:32 - 46:36)
is that this set comes out literally (46:34 - 46:40)
like two months from temporal forces (46:36 - 46:41)
which is short it's a short amount of (46:40 - 46:44)
time between regular sets to have it's (46:41 - 46:46)
usually three months between regular (46:44 - 46:49)
sets so for them to do almost exactly (46:46 - 46:53)
two months is short um it also because (46:49 - 46:55)
of the way that the international sets (46:53 - 46:57)
are put together it is a mixture of (46:55 - 47:01)
multiple Japanese sets so Twilight (46:57 - 47:04)
masquerade is going to be uh a (47:01 - 47:07)
combination of two Japanese sets um one (47:04 - 47:10)
is change of masks I believe which I'm (47:07 - 47:12)
assuming is ogre Pond stuff or mask of (47:10 - 47:15)
change and then Crimson Hayes so those (47:12 - 47:18)
come out in um Crimson hay I think came (47:15 - 47:19)
out today or comes out next week or (47:18 - 47:23)
yesterday for um Japan uh and mask of (47:19 - 47:26)
change comes out in April so they I (47:23 - 47:28)
guess they just wanted to put those two (47:26 - 47:31)
together they usually do three like (47:28 - 47:33)
they'll usually do three Japanese sets (47:31 - 47:37)
or two sets and like um some ex deck (47:33 - 47:40)
stuff with special EX cards um but in (47:37 - 47:42)
this case they're just doing two uh two (47:40 - 47:45)
Japanese sets for this one so I don't (47:42 - 47:47)
know I don't know why they shortened the (47:45 - 47:48)
if it's going to be if they want to do (47:47 - 47:49)
some kind of Summer release for (47:48 - 47:51)
something special or but I don't know (47:49 - 47:54)
why they shortened the uh time between (47:51 - 47:56)
the two regular (47:54 - 48:00)
sets yeah I don't I don't know I I'm (47:56 - 48:02)
very privileged and blessed that the (48:00 - 48:04)
Pokemon company sent me like a booster (48:02 - 48:07)
box and stuff and that's like not $140 (48:04 - 48:10)
that I have to go out and spend on cards (48:07 - 48:12)
but there was there was a point where in (48:10 - 48:15)
s in sword and shield I was (48:12 - 48:17)
getting they would send me cards every (48:15 - 48:19)
now and then and then I was I was for (48:17 - 48:21)
sure buying a booster box myself and (48:19 - 48:22)
then I was for sure buying an Elite (48:21 - 48:24)
Trainer Box and then sometimes when I (48:22 - 48:26)
walked into Target I was like ah they (48:24 - 48:28)
got this weird box collection like for (48:26 - 48:31)
20 bucks I'll get that right like I want (48:28 - 48:34)
the promo cards and then during the (48:31 - 48:35)
sword and shield era I was also getting (48:34 - 48:37)
japanese cards because I was like ah (48:35 - 48:39)
this is fun to collect too like I just I (48:37 - 48:41)
really just burnt myself out because (48:39 - 48:43)
like I didn't complete any sets like the (48:41 - 48:45)
closest sets I ended up completing was (48:43 - 48:47)
like Japanese stuff like I did feel (48:45 - 48:49)
pretty good with the Japanese stuff (48:47 - 48:52)
because Japanese sets are like 80 to 90 (48:49 - 48:54)
cards but they come out every month (48:52 - 48:55)
that's why like when Bobby said like (48:54 - 48:57)
this is usually three sets it's like (48:55 - 49:00)
three months of stuff they merg together (48:57 - 49:03)
Japanese stuff but with two boxes of (49:00 - 49:07)
Japanese stuff I could almost complete a (49:03 - 49:09)
set at that point which was like cool (49:07 - 49:11)
like I had a like I had a video idea of (49:09 - 49:13)
like oh I should bring my Japanese (49:11 - 49:15)
binders to Japan and like go to (49:13 - 49:16)
different Pokemon centers because I'm (49:15 - 49:18)
only missing like eight cards from each (49:16 - 49:21)
set and I was like I bet I could trade (49:18 - 49:22)
for those like last eight cards cuz (49:21 - 49:23)
that's way more fun than just going (49:22 - 49:26)
online and like clicking more expensive (49:23 - 49:29)
to for the record to fly to Japan but I (49:26 - 49:33)
am going there regardless of go Fest (49:29 - 49:36)
but like it's just easier to trade in (49:33 - 49:38)
Japan because like there are Pokemon (49:36 - 49:39)
centers and that the Pokemon centers are (49:38 - 49:41)
like trading booths and like they're (49:39 - 49:42)
always popular and they're always busy (49:41 - 49:44)
and they have leak leagues everywhere (49:42 - 49:46)
like Japan is very in person when it (49:44 - 49:49)
comes to Pokemon (49:46 - 49:52)
um that's why like I'm super excited for (49:49 - 49:55)
pocket like I think pocket will satisfy (49:52 - 49:59)
that itch of me want to complete a set (49:55 - 50:01)
without being like like I have so much (49:59 - 50:04)
unopened TCG stuff that i' I've (50:01 - 50:06)
purchased for the record I purchased (50:04 - 50:09)
that I don't want to open it because I (50:06 - 50:11)
like I don't want to sort it like where (50:09 - 50:13)
am I going to put it like I for the (50:11 - 50:15)
video podcast there's like this huge (50:13 - 50:17)
book not huge but there's this bookshelf (50:15 - 50:20)
behind me and it's all opened TCG stuff (50:17 - 50:22)
unsorted like it's sorted in the fact of (50:20 - 50:24)
like I opened it from this ETB and then (50:22 - 50:29)
it went back into this ETB (50:24 - 50:31)
but it still needs to be (50:29 - 50:34)
sorted like it's a full-time job it (50:31 - 50:35)
really is I kind of get why people just (50:34 - 50:37)
like buy slabs because they're prob (50:35 - 50:40)
they're just like trophy collecting at (50:37 - 50:41)
that point that sounds like negative I (50:40 - 50:42)
don't mean that in a negative way but (50:41 - 50:43)
they're just like I only care about (50:42 - 50:46)
these cards MH and like I don't care (50:43 - 50:49)
about the set which I get but I I do (50:46 - 50:54)
like to collect them all yeah I like I I (50:49 - 50:55)
just like going through the artwork just (50:54 - 50:57)
like flipping through pages on on the (50:55 - 50:59)
artwork of the set like so just even the (50:57 - 51:00)
commons the uncommons like nothing (50:59 - 51:02)
special but you know so I do have those (51:00 - 51:05)
set up in a certain way um like in some (51:02 - 51:07)
bigger binders where it's just all of (51:05 - 51:09)
those cards together um but then I'm not (51:07 - 51:11)
really trying to go and collect because (51:09 - 51:13)
those ones you can collect like the (51:11 - 51:16)
common uncommon and rare cards which are (51:13 - 51:18)
not like the ex they're not the special (51:16 - 51:20)
full arts or anything just those you (51:18 - 51:23)
could buy a booster box and you can get (51:20 - 51:26)
most of those cards if not all of them (51:23 - 51:28)
you can get most of them just the (51:26 - 51:31)
commons uncommons rares so I like to put (51:28 - 51:32)
those in kind of their own binder like a (51:31 - 51:34)
big binder with all of those so I can (51:32 - 51:35)
kind of flip through and just see all (51:34 - 51:38)
those artworks uh when it comes to the (51:35 - 51:41)
full arts and all of that I've come to (51:38 - 51:42)
the point where I'm like I think I'm (51:41 - 51:45)
just gonna trade or buy the ones I want (51:42 - 51:49)
and not try to open six booster boxes to (51:45 - 51:53)
get you know to get 20 cards you know 20 (51:49 - 51:55)
cards that I want just cuz it's (51:53 - 51:57)
expensive really is expensive yeah if (51:55 - 51:59)
you're not already committed to (51:57 - 52:01)
collecting the entire set (51:59 - 52:04)
mhm really just getting the ones you (52:01 - 52:06)
want seems to be the most realistic and (52:04 - 52:09)
when pocket comes out then you won't (52:06 - 52:11)
even have to go digging through your (52:09 - 52:14)
physical collection I know right I think (52:11 - 52:16)
I think pocket will push more physical (52:14 - 52:21)
card sales 100% that's probably the goal (52:16 - 52:23)
I was going to say I mean that's what (52:21 - 52:25)
honestly that's what TCG like online did (52:23 - 52:28)
for me because it was it was one thing (52:25 - 52:32)
to have that card on my you know iPad or (52:28 - 52:34)
computer screen but I was like I want to (52:32 - 52:36)
hold the card I want to have it with me (52:34 - 52:38)
it's like oh got to buy the physical (52:36 - 52:40)
cards to do that so I do feel like (52:38 - 52:43)
there's an aspect of it where it's cool (52:40 - 52:44)
if you collect it and you have it like (52:43 - 52:46)
digitally but then there's a part of you (52:44 - 52:48)
that's like but I want to have it in (52:46 - 52:50)
person you know like I want to actually (52:48 - 52:52)
be able to hold the card and see it and (52:50 - 52:54)
like you know turn it and see it like (52:52 - 52:56)
you can turn it and see the art in the (52:54 - 52:58)
light in the app they definitely are (52:56 - 53:00)
doing that in a much better way at (52:58 - 53:02)
pocket yes definitely much better than (53:00 - 53:05)
like live or or online but still it's (53:02 - 53:09)
it's not the same it's not once pocket (53:05 - 53:12)
is out if I have any urge to collect (53:09 - 53:13)
Pokemon cards I will stick to that (53:12 - 53:16)
unless there's one I literally want to (53:13 - 53:18)
display at which point then then just (53:16 - 53:21)
buying an individual one yeah yeah I (53:18 - 53:23)
mean that's some way some sometimes (53:21 - 53:26)
people just collect a specific Pokemon (53:23 - 53:28)
right or specific artist right which is (53:26 - 53:30)
kind of fun to like just go through and (53:28 - 53:32)
collect a specific artist and put that (53:30 - 53:34)
binder together or something so I mean (53:32 - 53:36)
so many different ways of collecting but (53:34 - 53:39)
uh I think pocket will be a a fun a fun (53:36 - 53:41)
way to do that on your phone rather than (53:39 - 53:43)
uh have a bunch of I have like Steve (53:41 - 53:47)
said I behind me is this like little uh (53:43 - 53:49)
this little dresser thing and it's got (53:47 - 53:53)
just full of all the bulk extra just (53:49 - 53:56)
full of these like long the white uh (53:53 - 53:59)
boxes just a bunch of bulk in there so (53:56 - 54:00)
um you know it you got to put it (53:59 - 54:05)
somewhere yeah yeah yeah um I think I (54:00 - 54:08)
think we talked about this when I was at (54:05 - 54:11)
Worlds in Japan but the one of the (54:08 - 54:13)
weirdest the weirder things was when I (54:11 - 54:14)
was walking through that Pokemon Center (54:13 - 54:19)
at Worlds uh in Yokohama they only had (54:14 - 54:22)
American cards on the Shelf like etbs (54:19 - 54:25)
booster boxes all that stuff and I asked (54:22 - 54:27)
the Pokemon rep uh the the dude who (54:25 - 54:29)
invited me and and brought me out to (54:27 - 54:33)
Japan I was like what we're in Japan why (54:29 - 54:36)
is all of this just like English and he (54:33 - 54:37)
said that they couldn't get Japanese (54:36 - 54:39)
cards because they were just sold out (54:37 - 54:43)
everywhere so like I I know that like (54:39 - 54:45)
there was that dark period during covid (54:43 - 54:47)
where it was impossible to find like (54:45 - 54:49)
Vivid voltage or darkness of Blaze or (54:47 - 54:51)
like (54:49 - 54:54)
whatever and I think we can all safely (54:51 - 54:56)
say Logan Paul was part part of the (54:54 - 54:58)
blame on that one with with his YouTube (54:56 - 55:02)
videos but say what and and I said like (54:58 - 55:03)
20 minutes ago that I haven't really (55:02 - 55:05)
been into the TCG it has nothing to do (55:03 - 55:07)
with Scarlet Violet I love Scarlet (55:05 - 55:09)
Violet Pokemon I love that they redid (55:07 - 55:11)
the Border I hate that they didn't redo (55:09 - 55:13)
the back of the card because in the (55:11 - 55:16)
Pocket app they did redo the back of the (55:13 - 55:20)
card and it looks so good and it's it it (55:16 - 55:23)
makes me more frustrated that like they (55:20 - 55:25)
changed the gray border but they didn't (55:23 - 55:27)
change the back of the card and I know (55:25 - 55:30)
that like TC like competitive people (55:27 - 55:31)
like ah it would be me you have to like (55:30 - 55:33)
in a competitive tournament you have to (55:31 - 55:35)
sleeve anyways and it can't be clear (55:33 - 55:37)
sleeves that's not allowed in the rules (55:35 - 55:40)
has to be like a whatever is opposite of (55:37 - 55:45)
opaque solid it has to be a solid back M (55:40 - 55:46)
just like bite the bullet and change the (55:45 - 55:48)
back of the cards they did this in Japan (55:46 - 55:52)
like 15 years ago MH the back is so ugly (55:48 - 55:54)
uh what was I saying oh but like Scarlet (55:52 - 55:57)
Violet TCG in Japan has been doing (55:54 - 55:59)
really really well like it's still like (55:57 - 56:02)
it's easier to find now than it was back (55:59 - 56:05)
with worlds but like (56:02 - 56:08)
yeah TCG still doing good I think pocket (56:05 - 56:11)
only helps push that when that drops (56:08 - 56:12)
yeah japanese cards had the hiccup with (56:11 - 56:15)
um there was one set I want to say it (56:12 - 56:16)
was called like I think it was Clay (56:15 - 56:18)
burst or something and had I think it (56:16 - 56:20)
was the set that had that first set that (56:18 - 56:22)
had like an iono like special (56:20 - 56:25)
illustration in that was really popular (56:22 - 56:26)
and they had to put out a statement to (56:25 - 56:28)
talk about having to print more for that (56:26 - 56:31)
set and they apologized for like the (56:28 - 56:34)
inability to get to like um to find that (56:31 - 56:35)
set in stores and stuff and there so (56:34 - 56:37)
there was that little hiccup with (56:35 - 56:41)
Scarlet pilot but um the other thing is (56:37 - 56:44)
that the cards in U Japanese um they (56:41 - 56:45)
seem to hold their value a little bit (56:44 - 56:47)
better with the Scarlet Violet set than (56:45 - 56:49)
the international cards have um which I (56:47 - 56:53)
think is pushing more people to purchase (56:49 - 56:57)
singles and maybe not buy sets as much (56:53 - 56:59)
so that's another I think it's another (56:57 - 57:01)
factor and it'll be interesting to see (56:59 - 57:04)
if if that changes at all or if that's (57:01 - 57:07)
just kind of kind of be the way it is um (57:04 - 57:09)
so should be interesting to see how it (57:07 - 57:12)
goes yeah I'm I'm very curious of just (57:09 - 57:15)
like a normal like the very first time I (57:12 - 57:19)
went to Japan which was before (57:15 - 57:22)
Co it was you just saw Pokemon cards (57:19 - 57:24)
everywhere like you could walk into like (57:22 - 57:26)
a 7-Eleven or Family Mart and they would (57:24 - 57:29)
just be like next to the Band-Aids (57:26 - 57:33)
yep and then when I went back last (57:29 - 57:36)
year it was so hard to find Pokemon (57:33 - 57:39)
cards even in like a Pokemon Center like (57:36 - 57:42)
you would walk into like Tokyo DX and (57:39 - 57:43)
they would be (57:42 - 57:46)
like cards are behind the counter we're (57:43 - 57:49)
only doing one box per person like but (57:46 - 57:50)
also we're sold out for the day so come (57:49 - 57:52)
back tomorrow (57:50 - 57:55)
wow yeah so it was very it was very (57:52 - 57:57)
jarring to go from like oh man like (57:55 - 58:00)
Family Mart has like Pokemon cards on (57:57 - 58:03)
the Shelf to like oh I can't find them (58:00 - 58:07)
anywhere uh so now that it's going to be (58:03 - 58:09)
like a full year later I I do I I still (58:07 - 58:11)
doubt that Family Mart will be stocking (58:09 - 58:12)
I'm sure they would want the stock (58:11 - 58:14)
Pokemon cards I'm sure they sold very (58:12 - 58:17)
well but they they might I mean Japan (58:14 - 58:22)
had a delay on the covid stuff that Happ (58:17 - 58:25)
not Co but on the co on the the card uh (58:22 - 58:27)
stuff that happened here so we saw that (58:25 - 58:30)
right for 20 in 2020 2021 it was really (58:27 - 58:32)
hard to find cards it wasn't hard to get (58:30 - 58:35)
them from Japan though at that time the (58:32 - 58:37)
boxes were still decently priced you (58:35 - 58:38)
could still you could even you could (58:37 - 58:40)
import them for decent prices like from (58:38 - 58:43)
Japan it wasn't hard to find Japanese (58:40 - 58:47)
cards and then 2020 like late 2022 into (58:43 - 58:51)
2023 it's like they experienced what (58:47 - 58:54)
America was experiencing for the cards (58:51 - 58:56)
in 2021 like that you couldn't all of (58:54 - 58:58)
sudden you couldn't find any japanese (58:56 - 59:01)
cards anywhere and international English (58:58 - 59:02)
cards were a little bit easier to find (59:01 - 59:05)
so I don't know it was a weird delay but (59:02 - 59:06)
I think it's sort of like you said I (59:05 - 59:08)
think it's sort of evened out overall (59:06 - 59:11)
now so both family Marts might have (59:08 - 59:14)
cards again you never know that's that (59:11 - 59:15)
that's my pure goal getting a pack of (59:14 - 59:17)
cards from Family Mart that's the way to (59:15 - 59:20)
do it you get yours get paraki sweat and (59:17 - 59:24)
and a pack of cards and it's a good time (59:20 - 59:26)
sounds like a perfect evening in Japan (59:24 - 59:29)
really yeah getting on giddy you've got (59:26 - 59:32)
your dinner there perfect it works out (59:29 - 59:35)
perfectly perfect actually moving to (59:32 - 59:36)
Japan sound more and more appealing I (59:35 - 59:38)
don't leave my house anyways I just need (59:36 - 59:40)
access to a 7-Eleven at 2 a.m. and then (59:38 - 59:44)
I'm set there yeah that's all I (59:40 - 59:48)
need uh Pokemon (59:44 - 59:53)
go okay let me I I was at before we get (59:48 - 59:55)
to the news uh I have no clue what Bobby (59:53 - 59:59)
needed for me so this is perfect I'm I'm (59:55 - 60:00)
I'm at M of (59:59 - 60:04)
America I'm doing my laps I I went very (60:00 - 60:05)
hard for liton Community Day my goal was (60:04 - 60:08)
to either get a big shiny Litton or a (60:05 - 60:10)
small shiny Litton because that's my (60:08 - 60:12)
goal for every Community Day is to get a (60:10 - 60:15)
big shiny or a small shiny and I I (60:12 - 60:16)
haven't done it since they've rolled it (60:15 - 60:19)
out and so I was like I'm G to get there (60:16 - 60:21)
before two o'clock when maybe grab (60:19 - 60:24)
something to eat I'm going to have all (60:21 - 60:27)
my incense Mega buddy out everything (60:24 - 60:30)
prepped before the clock flips over I (60:27 - 60:32)
ended up getting a tiny shiny Litton and (60:30 - 60:35)
then I plus plused a big shiny Litton so (60:32 - 60:37)
I got both which is awesome because (60:35 - 60:38)
lon's one of my favorite Pokemon but (60:37 - 60:41)
anyways randomly anyways besides me (60:38 - 60:44)
bragging uh Bobby sends me this random (60:41 - 60:47)
text going can you buy me the Litton (60:44 - 60:52)
community research I'll explain (60:47 - 60:56)
later I was like what I was like the guy (60:52 - 60:57)
who buys (60:56 - 61:01)
everything is asking me to pay for his (60:57 - 61:04)
lit and research for the $1 ticket it's (61:01 - 61:06)
it's even better than that because I (61:04 - 61:10)
bought five or six other people the lon (61:06 - 61:12)
research Community day earlier in the (61:10 - 61:14)
day um because that's been my thing like (61:12 - 61:17)
I love love love love the alola starters (61:14 - 61:20)
and alola in general and so ret (61:17 - 61:22)
Community Day and then again Aon I just (61:20 - 61:24)
like post it up in this slack like (61:22 - 61:26)
anybody want the research like I'm down (61:24 - 61:27)
like I'll buy a few people to research (61:26 - 61:29)
just cuz like have fun with it have a (61:27 - 61:31)
little bit extra like something to get (61:29 - 61:33)
and like I just I love it so there were (61:31 - 61:35)
maybe like five or six people who I (61:33 - 61:37)
gifted the research to but I never (61:35 - 61:39)
bought it myself like I didn't buy it (61:37 - 61:40)
myself beforehand I was like I'll just (61:39 - 61:43)
buy it when like Community day starts or (61:40 - 61:46)
whatever so two o'clock rolls around all (61:43 - 61:50)
my spawns change to Litton uh it's 2011 (61:46 - 61:53)
my time like 2011 or 202 my time and I (61:50 - 61:55)
go into the shop I I caught a few and (61:53 - 61:57)
remembered like oh I haven't bought the (61:55 - 61:59)
research yet let me go buy that so I you (61:57 - 62:01)
know I'm like cuz it's like catch you (61:59 - 62:02)
got to catch like 45 Lon during the (62:01 - 62:07)
research right so uh I go into the shop (62:02 - 62:09)
the lon research is there I go click on (62:07 - 62:12)
it there's no option to gift it anymore (62:09 - 62:14)
there's just a buy option I'm like (62:12 - 62:17)
that's weird can't gift it okay whatever (62:14 - 62:19)
I click buy and it's like you may not (62:17 - 62:22)
purchase this anymore literally the eror (62:19 - 62:24)
mess was just like you made up for like (62:22 - 62:25)
the time limit to purchas this is over (62:24 - 62:28)
or something and I was like what excuse (62:25 - 62:30)
me that's not how that usually goes yeah (62:28 - 62:33)
so I thought okay I haven't reset the (62:30 - 62:35)
app since it flipped over to community (62:33 - 62:37)
day so maybe there's just some kind of (62:35 - 62:40)
weird thing with that so I Clos the app (62:37 - 62:42)
it's now again it's like 203 right just (62:40 - 62:45)
started I open the app and it's gone (62:42 - 62:48)
like the L research is just gone I can't (62:45 - 62:49)
buy I can't even like click there's (62:48 - 62:51)
nothing to click it's just the Kyogre re (62:49 - 62:56)
uh raid day research yeah and the the (62:51 - 62:57)
seasonal research which I have not (62:56 - 62:58)
bought yet cuz that seems like a (62:57 - 63:02)
terrible terrible the oh the the $10 one (62:58 - 63:05)
value yeah yeah um well you don't know (63:02 - 63:06)
what you're getting for 2third of it (63:05 - 63:09)
okay I will probably buy it later in the (63:06 - 63:10)
season CU you can do it at any time or (63:09 - 63:12)
whatever anyways that that's besid the (63:10 - 63:18)
point um so it was gone so I immediately (63:12 - 63:20)
like messaged people in slack and I was (63:18 - 63:22)
like hey did they change the rules to (63:20 - 63:24)
where you can't buy this like during (63:22 - 63:26)
your community day or something and (63:24 - 63:28)
everybody else was like no I bought mine (63:26 - 63:29)
during Community like anybody who bought (63:28 - 63:30)
it was like no I bought it like an hour (63:29 - 63:33)
into Community Day and I was like all (63:30 - 63:35)
right so I'm thinking like maybe they (63:33 - 63:37)
accidentally turned it off because like (63:35 - 63:39)
in New York it's 5 o'clock and so just (63:37 - 63:41)
across America they were like it's 5 (63:39 - 63:44)
o'clock let's just turn this off yeah so (63:41 - 63:47)
I my wife got onto her account she (63:44 - 63:48)
didn't have it either it wasn't there (63:47 - 63:51)
there was no lit in research or anything (63:48 - 63:54)
to buy so I messaged I texted Steve and (63:51 - 63:56)
I'm like hey can you please give me the (63:54 - 63:58)
RE let me see if the gift Works can you (63:56 - 64:00)
gift me it and maybe like I'll you know (63:58 - 64:02)
maybe you'll have it and you did and it (64:00 - 64:04)
worked yeah I I was just in my store (64:02 - 64:06)
normally and I was able to do the (64:04 - 64:09)
research no problem um but I did turn (64:06 - 64:11)
the app I did check the shop about two (64:09 - 64:14)
hours into the community day and it was (64:11 - 64:17)
back so they clearly there was something (64:14 - 64:19)
it wasn't there for the first like 20 (64:17 - 64:21)
minutes of the community day it was gone (64:19 - 64:24)
it wasn't there um but at one point in (64:21 - 64:26)
that time frame they put it back in (64:24 - 64:29)
there and it was uh available again but (64:26 - 64:31)
I was I was just I was super surprised I (64:29 - 64:33)
was like how are they not allowing (64:31 - 64:35)
people to buy it during the community (64:33 - 64:37)
day like this is like the time that (64:35 - 64:39)
people would be like oh I should go you (64:37 - 64:41)
know spend this Dollar on This research (64:39 - 64:43)
since there's all these lit and spawns (64:41 - 64:45)
everywhere um but I don't know must have (64:43 - 64:48)
just been a shocking to for Niantic to (64:45 - 64:49)
have a bug during one of their events (64:48 - 64:51)
yeah that's real weird for I can't (64:49 - 64:53)
remember the last time that happened but (64:51 - 64:55)
uh but yeah weird good so so thank you (64:53 - 64:57)
Steve for gifting me the uh the liton (64:55 - 64:59)
Community Day research yeah you're (64:57 - 65:03)
welcome I was I was like slightly bummed (64:59 - 65:05)
uh my friend in Japan she gifted me uh (65:03 - 65:08)
the research for Linton which is like (65:05 - 65:10)
very nice like thank you for the dollar (65:08 - 65:12)
passed it on to Bobby but I was bummed (65:10 - 65:14)
because Niantic for the first time said (65:12 - 65:16)
that if you checked into your community (65:14 - 65:18)
Ambassador thing you would get the (65:16 - 65:20)
ticket so I wanted to see how that (65:18 - 65:23)
worked MH um because there is an (65:20 - 65:25)
officially a community Ambassador at (65:23 - 65:27)
Mall of America there wasn't at one (65:25 - 65:29)
point um but there because there was one (65:27 - 65:32)
at like Lake nomus in in Minneapolis (65:29 - 65:35)
which like it's like an okay like Lake (65:32 - 65:36)
and park the problem with it though is (65:35 - 65:38)
like once you're like halfway through (65:36 - 65:41)
you're like committed and like either (65:38 - 65:43)
you either backtrack or you finish going (65:41 - 65:45)
around the lake so it's like not the (65:43 - 65:47)
also it was cold yesterday so not the (65:45 - 65:49)
best place to play so there is a (65:47 - 65:51)
official poke stop Community Ambassador (65:49 - 65:53)
like last Community Day I like checked (65:51 - 65:54)
in but like nothing happened I was just (65:53 - 65:57)
like I checked in I'm here I so I wanted (65:54 - 65:58)
to see how the lint thing worked with (65:57 - 66:00)
the check-in MH but because I was (65:58 - 66:04)
already gifted one I couldn't test it (66:00 - 66:08)
um which like it would be cool if what I (66:04 - 66:09)
was when Bobby texted me I was like oh (66:08 - 66:12)
maybe if I like check in I'll get the (66:09 - 66:14)
research and then it will cuz if if two (66:12 - 66:16)
people gift you (66:14 - 66:18)
research or like if you buy research or (66:16 - 66:20)
gift it like it turns into a ticket (66:18 - 66:22)
where you can just forward the gift to (66:20 - 66:24)
wait what I've had that (66:22 - 66:28)
before really I so I that's neat one of (66:24 - 66:30)
the people that I um was going to gift (66:28 - 66:32)
the research to they had like forgotten (66:30 - 66:34)
that I was going to they just bought it (66:32 - 66:35)
themselves and then when I went to gift (66:34 - 66:36)
it it wouldn't let me gift them the (66:35 - 66:38)
research it was like this person cannot (66:36 - 66:39)
be (66:38 - 66:42)
gifted uh the research I think I've run (66:39 - 66:44)
into that too maybe if it's I wonder if (66:42 - 66:46)
it's just like the issue that you the (66:44 - 66:48)
overlap issue where like it doesn't (66:46 - 66:50)
register that you purchased it and then (66:48 - 66:52)
somebody gifts it and then you purchase (66:50 - 66:54)
it cuz I've definitely had extra commun (66:52 - 66:57)
day tickets in my inventory and all you (66:54 - 66:59)
do is you click on the ticket and then (66:57 - 67:00)
the friends list pops up and then you (66:59 - 67:03)
can just send it to somebody that's cool (67:00 - 67:04)
maybe you can maybe it's like if you buy (67:03 - 67:07)
it after you have it or something maybe (67:04 - 67:08)
if someone givs it to you and then you (67:07 - 67:11)
buy it second you can then do something (67:08 - 67:12)
you can like then do something with it (67:11 - 67:15)
or something I don't know I yeah I think (67:12 - 67:16)
that's how it worked because I think I (67:15 - 67:18)
was gifted one m and then Niantic gave (67:16 - 67:21)
me a code and I redeem the code and then (67:18 - 67:23)
it turned into the one it just turned (67:21 - 67:24)
into an auto gift and then I could send (67:23 - 67:26)
it to somebody else that's cool honestly (67:24 - 67:28)
I'm surprised that that's built in there (67:26 - 67:31)
and not just a bug that breaks stuff I'm (67:28 - 67:33)
impressed surprised that diic just takes (67:31 - 67:35)
your money and they're like ah you (67:33 - 67:37)
gifted this person five tickets oh (67:35 - 67:39)
well $5 for (67:37 - 67:43)
[Laughter] (67:39 - 67:45)
us (67:43 - 67:48)
um we haven't been negative enough this (67:45 - 67:50)
show can I complain about weather week (67:48 - 67:53)
holy cow that what a what a (67:50 - 67:56)
nightmare I texted Bobby and I was like (67:53 - 68:00)
how do I get snowy cast how do people in (67:56 - 68:02)
California get snowy cast yeah you you (68:00 - 68:04)
texted me the person in Cal in Southern (68:02 - 68:06)
California and was like how do I get (68:04 - 68:08)
snowy form cast form I don't know I (68:06 - 68:13)
haven't seen snow in a decade but uh um (68:08 - 68:14)
yeah that's it's unfortunate because (68:13 - 68:18)
this is not a great way to do this I (68:14 - 68:20)
mean they were they were in research (68:18 - 68:22)
right yes so that is the way that you do (68:20 - 68:25)
it you have to get the research task (68:22 - 68:28)
that is Catch 10 weather boosted Pokemon (68:25 - 68:29)
um and if you're listening to this when (68:28 - 68:31)
the episode comes out you still have (68:29 - 68:34)
like it ends Monday evening I believe um (68:31 - 68:36)
so you know you still have time but you (68:34 - 68:38)
have to get that task Catch 10 weather (68:36 - 68:40)
boed Pokemon 10 yeah it's not the five (68:38 - 68:43)
not the seven the Seven's like Stardust (68:40 - 68:45)
uh Catch 10 it will be one of the four (68:43 - 68:49)
forms it it'll just randomly although my (68:45 - 68:50)
last like four of them have been Sunny (68:49 - 68:52)
form which has been really (68:50 - 68:54)
annoying I've got a bunch of those (68:52 - 68:57)
spawning I don't need those uh I'm (68:54 - 69:00)
missing rainy form uh personally and it (68:57 - 69:03)
rained it rained out of nowhere for like (69:00 - 69:06)
two hours on Thursday and it did not (69:03 - 69:08)
change to rainy weather in the game and (69:06 - 69:11)
I was so irritated it stayed cloudy in (69:08 - 69:14)
the game uh but yeah it's you got to get (69:11 - 69:16)
those research that's the only way to do (69:14 - 69:18)
it is get those research tasks I know I (69:16 - 69:20)
have to go out and do it the my problem (69:18 - 69:23)
with this is not like I get that cast (69:20 - 69:26)
form is based off weather I and and it's (69:23 - 69:28)
cool that they put them in tasks that's (69:26 - 69:30)
fine like cuz now I can go to mall (69:28 - 69:32)
America I can keep spinning until I get (69:30 - 69:34)
the Catch 10 hopefully and I could do (69:32 - 69:36)
Kyogre at the same time so it's my goal (69:34 - 69:39)
after recording this what bothered me is (69:36 - 69:41)
I before I looked any of this up I'm (69:39 - 69:45)
sitting on the couch and I pop a snowy (69:41 - 69:49)
Glacier lur and I'm like cool in 30 (69:45 - 69:52)
minutes I have to get one snowy cast (69:49 - 69:57)
form yeah and the lurs don't populate (69:52 - 69:59)
formed it will populate cast form but (69:57 - 70:01)
the cast form is still based off the (69:59 - 70:04)
weather which that was like the biggest (70:01 - 70:08)
complaint slm is like at any point (70:04 - 70:11)
Niantic can change what appears in a (70:08 - 70:13)
lur and if they're going to say weather (70:11 - 70:15)
week and two of the three two of the (70:13 - 70:20)
Four cast forms match the lurs yeah and (70:15 - 70:21)
that's just another way for us to give (70:20 - 70:25)
Niantic money like it is free to spin (70:21 - 70:26)
Poké stops and be like okay catch 10 (70:25 - 70:30)
Pokemon cool but like I would for the (70:26 - 70:32)
sake of convenience Niantic I wanted to (70:30 - 70:35)
just sit on the couch give you $2 and be (70:32 - 70:38)
like in 30 minutes I I caught the snowy (70:35 - 70:42)
one wait so you live within I'm more (70:38 - 70:44)
jealous of the fact that you live (70:42 - 70:48)
within stop I was at a friend's house oh (70:44 - 70:50)
okay I was like I'm that's the that's (70:48 - 70:53)
the key here is that youment on two two (70:50 - 70:55)
Poké stops which I'm very jealous of (70:53 - 70:58)
that's yeah that's the that's the move (70:55 - 71:00)
is to live on the Poké stops Bobby I (70:58 - 71:03)
feel like you are five Pok stops you're (71:00 - 71:05)
on five Poké stops if I drift a little (71:03 - 71:08)
bit that's insane I would I would (71:05 - 71:10)
literally just like wrap a rubber band (71:08 - 71:13)
around like a go Plus+ yeah that's just (71:10 - 71:15)
have it running and plug it into the (71:13 - 71:17)
wall so it doesn't die and just have it (71:15 - 71:19)
running non-stop there's and just like (71:17 - 71:23)
every hour clear it and then just reedo (71:19 - 71:24)
you have to do the inventory management (71:23 - 71:26)
constantly at that point it's just a (71:24 - 71:28)
game of inventory management seriously (71:26 - 71:30)
but there's a Bobby would definitely (71:28 - 71:32)
move to a different location that was on (71:30 - 71:35)
a pokop 100% well there's an artist that (71:32 - 71:38)
uh did one of the like apartment (71:35 - 71:40)
buildings around the corner they did (71:38 - 71:42)
like a really nice mural on like two of (71:40 - 71:44)
the buildings and one of them got turned (71:42 - 71:46)
into a poké stop but it's like just out (71:44 - 71:49)
of range so like every once in a while (71:46 - 71:52)
my uh Avatar will drift over and I can (71:49 - 71:54)
like spin it and then it comes back but (71:52 - 71:56)
it's like just out of arrange so it so (71:54 - 71:58)
it's like I'm trying to figure out like (71:56 - 72:01)
what can I set up in our front yard to (71:58 - 72:03)
take a picture of they don't do little (72:01 - 72:05)
free libraries anymore I think you would (72:03 - 72:06)
actually have to pay somebody for a (72:05 - 72:10)
mural somewhere but yeah my experience (72:06 - 72:12)
if you turn off your Wi-Fi on your phone (72:10 - 72:14)
and you walk over to the complete other (72:12 - 72:16)
side of your house away from the mural (72:14 - 72:18)
and then walk over towards the mural (72:16 - 72:20)
with Wi-Fi off that should help with the (72:18 - 72:23)
drift that gets you there yeah because I (72:20 - 72:25)
think paying someone to do a mural is a (72:23 - 72:27)
bit much of an investment for Pokemon go (72:25 - 72:30)
cheaper than moving well yes true (72:27 - 72:32)
cheaper than moving can't do that I (72:30 - 72:34)
think uh we're stuck with this house for (72:32 - 72:37)
a little while since just buy buy a (72:34 - 72:40)
statue put a statue in your yard just (72:37 - 72:42)
buy a statue do you think that would be (72:40 - 72:45)
an adventure effect like how because (72:42 - 72:48)
like Pia's Adventure effect of spatial (72:45 - 72:51)
Rend is so incredibly good I love it I (72:48 - 72:53)
love that's why I was able to get that's (72:51 - 72:54)
what I've been saying that's why I went (72:53 - 72:58)
for palia not Diga I'm just gonna so (72:54 - 73:01)
many of you were saying Diga was better (72:58 - 73:03)
Hannah was right I was wrong palia is (73:01 - 73:06)
the better one I think the only reason I (73:03 - 73:10)
got yeah palia is actually even like go (73:06 - 73:12)
or not go Fest cotor has completely (73:10 - 73:14)
changed my opinion of palia and dalga (73:12 - 73:17)
origin form like I don't like either of (73:14 - 73:18)
them but I thought dalga was better (73:17 - 73:20)
before and now that I've like taken (73:18 - 73:22)
pictures and stuff of palia I'm like (73:20 - 73:24)
this is the clear winner like looks cool (73:22 - 73:26)
Diaga still just looks like it's a bug (73:24 - 73:28)
yeah I'm sorry py has got the just like (73:26 - 73:33)
the horse the horse effect I don't (73:28 - 73:37)
know centur without arms yeah so much (73:33 - 73:41)
better um yeah I think like like I (73:37 - 73:43)
already at mall America I have too many (73:41 - 73:45)
things to (73:43 - 73:47)
tap and if you keep walking there's too (73:45 - 73:49)
many things to tap but (73:47 - 73:52)
like when you're at and you can have the (73:49 - 73:56)
Pokeball plus do it obviously (73:52 - 73:58)
but when I activate palia I'm like (73:56 - 74:01)
seeing into like the parking lot which (73:58 - 74:02)
also has a ton of spawns because it's (74:01 - 74:04)
based off cell phone traffic and people (74:02 - 74:05)
are parking there and then I'm seeing (74:04 - 74:07)
inside the mall the amusement park which (74:05 - 74:09)
I never go because I don't want to catch (74:07 - 74:11)
cooties from any of those kids uh (74:09 - 74:13)
they're everywhere they're just running (74:11 - 74:14)
and you know they're all sick you know (74:13 - 74:15)
none of them wash their hands I don't (74:14 - 74:17)
want them bumping into me so those are (74:15 - 74:18)
like the like you just walk in the (74:17 - 74:20)
circle of mall America and you stay away (74:18 - 74:21)
from the center because that amusement (74:20 - 74:25)
park is is is a a germ trap and then you (74:21 - 74:27)
get all the the spawns but then I was (74:25 - 74:28)
able to (74:27 - 74:31)
like tap on those because the Pokeball (74:28 - 74:35)
plus is only focused on the inside track (74:31 - 74:36)
um and I think that's how I was able to (74:35 - 74:38)
get the plus (74:36 - 74:41)
doesn't the plus will always try at (74:38 - 74:43)
least from my experience the plus will (74:41 - 74:45)
always try to go around you first right (74:43 - 74:46)
so then it's like safe to tap the ones (74:45 - 74:49)
that are farther away got it and just (74:46 - 74:51)
let the plus (74:49 - 74:53)
like like suck up everything in front of (74:51 - 74:54)
you like a little (74:53 - 74:56)
Roomba and then you can get the ones on (74:54 - 74:58)
the outside so I think that's how I was (74:56 - 74:59)
able to get both a big and a tiny is (74:58 - 75:02)
just cuz I saw so many Litt and it's (74:59 - 75:03)
actually funny if you like see my (75:02 - 75:05)
screenshot of like the small one and the (75:03 - 75:07)
big one on like Twitter like you can (75:05 - 75:09)
also see like I literally doubled my XL (75:07 - 75:12)
candy within like an hour I went from (75:09 - 75:15)
like 300 to like 600 XL because I was (75:12 - 75:16)
just catching so (75:15 - 75:20)
many um but then I think of like when I (75:16 - 75:22)
went to the was (75:20 - 75:26)
it was it the hoen tour Global tour or (75:22 - 75:27)
whatever no it was go Fest it was the (75:26 - 75:29)
one with the Pikachu crowns I went to (75:27 - 75:33)
this park and I played there and it was (75:29 - 75:34)
fine it was like a gorgeous day out it's (75:33 - 75:37)
a very nice park everything great there (75:34 - 75:39)
but the whole time I'm like at that Park (75:37 - 75:42)
I'm thinking if I just went to mall (75:39 - 75:45)
America I would have more spawns like (75:42 - 75:49)
more things to see but now with palia I (75:45 - 75:51)
think like oh I think that makes the (75:49 - 75:54)
park even like I think that makes Park (75:51 - 75:55)
situations just much better like it's so (75:54 - 75:57)
busted good at Mall of America but the (75:55 - 75:59)
problem is you're you're inside it's (75:57 - 76:00)
like kind of Stuffy there's like a lot (75:59 - 76:03)
of people but like being at an outside (76:00 - 76:05)
and a gorgeous day in a park and it's (76:03 - 76:07)
like I don't really want to go back to (76:05 - 76:10)
that park for go Fest World Tour but I (76:07 - 76:13)
do think that palia makes fixes that (76:10 - 76:16)
issue of just adding more spawns and (76:13 - 76:18)
expanding out so I think what I'm saying (76:16 - 76:20)
is I think Pia fixes a lot of parks yeah (76:18 - 76:22)
if you have enough candy that's where (76:20 - 76:24)
someone who as someone who doesn't do (76:22 - 76:26)
PVP yet raids a lot lot the rare candy (76:24 - 76:29)
finally have a place to go which is into (76:26 - 76:32)
P straight into Pia now right I wonder (76:29 - 76:33)
if there will be more Adventure effects (76:32 - 76:35)
and I wonder if one of them would be (76:33 - 76:37)
like increased spin radius yes that (76:35 - 76:39)
would that fixes your problem Bobby yeah (76:37 - 76:40)
that would be really cool and then I (76:39 - 76:42)
would need to H I'd have to spend more (76:40 - 76:44)
money on raids I don't want to think for (76:42 - 76:45)
rare candy for the Pokemon whatever the (76:44 - 76:47)
Pokemon is because I think they would (76:45 - 76:48)
keep those do you think they would keep (76:47 - 76:49)
those Adventure effects to like (76:48 - 76:51)
legendary Pokemon like I I feel like we (76:49 - 76:54)
wouldn't have like a Rattata with an (76:51 - 76:55)
adventure effect where you like someone (76:54 - 76:59)
has like 10,000 candy and it'd be nice (76:55 - 77:02)
Wu's Adventure effect boost your Pokemon (76:59 - 77:05)
sleep (77:02 - 77:05)
yes no I I still think that white kierum (77:06 - 77:13)
and black kierum will have Adventure (77:11 - 77:14)
effects you mean the ones that were (77:13 - 77:16)
there for a minute and then were not (77:14 - 77:18)
there for a minute because I think (77:16 - 77:21)
that's I this is my tin tinfoil hat (77:18 - 77:22)
theory that they got pushed early (77:21 - 77:24)
because they were they were testing Tak (77:22 - 77:25)
and Diago (77:24 - 77:28)
they they were just so close to all of (77:25 - 77:30)
that like how do you accidentally push (77:28 - 77:33)
two Pokemon (77:30 - 77:36)
that wouldn't have otherwise completely (77:33 - 77:38)
unrelated to anything going on in your (77:36 - 77:40)
game at the moment yeah right unless (77:38 - 77:42)
they were unless they had something (77:40 - 77:45)
going on that really built up the Unova (77:42 - 77:49)
Unova incoming situation it really did (77:45 - 77:50)
yeah like we're not getting black Kum or (77:49 - 77:52)
white Kum until like you know NOA tour (77:50 - 77:57)
right there's probably no way could be (77:52 - 78:00)
earlier I was I was fully set to get (77:57 - 78:01)
archus for go Fest though and then (78:00 - 78:03)
they're like Mar Shadow there not even a (78:01 - 78:06)
spot for archus in the Pokedex I don't (78:03 - 78:07)
know why anyone thinks we're getting (78:06 - 78:08)
that anytime soon well because there (78:07 - 78:10)
it's only because we haven't it's the (78:08 - 78:12)
last one in the pokeddex isn't (78:10 - 78:15)
it the last one poex it's not there (78:12 - 78:17)
though there's no number but there's (78:15 - 78:18)
never a number when there's not a (78:17 - 78:21)
Pokemon past it in the in that specific (78:18 - 78:24)
pokeddex so like when new when a new (78:21 - 78:27)
Pokedex comes out like when hisi came (78:24 - 78:30)
out like yeah you'd only have if the (78:27 - 78:33)
okay I see say I see what you're saying (78:30 - 78:34)
C came out and only the starters came (78:33 - 78:38)
out there would be nothing past um I (78:34 - 78:39)
don't think I've ever noticed that (78:38 - 78:41)
that's the same way it works with like (78:39 - 78:42)
um there's other things that work that (78:41 - 78:44)
same way where the way it's set up is it (78:42 - 78:47)
doesn't show you a number past a Pokemon (78:44 - 78:49)
that's there yeah so because archus is (78:47 - 78:51)
the last one in the co decks it doesn't (78:49 - 78:53)
show a number for it because there's (78:51 - 78:55)
nothing after it in the co decks to (78:53 - 78:57)
manaia and fion not after AR they're (78:55 - 78:59)
before it and they have spot and they (78:57 - 79:01)
have numbers in the C decks because they (78:59 - 79:05)
have stuff after it yeah archus not (79:01 - 79:08)
appearing didn't bother me at all it (79:05 - 79:10)
didn't no because the to those tours (79:08 - 79:11)
have never given us a new mythical (79:10 - 79:13)
they've only ever given us researches to (79:11 - 79:16)
shiny mythicals in the past so I didn't (79:13 - 79:18)
expect to get archus at the c tour or (79:16 - 79:19)
Mana (79:18 - 79:21)
F first time for everything obviously (79:19 - 79:23)
but I wasn't surprised that we didn't (79:21 - 79:26)
get that but I I just assumed like come (79:23 - 79:28)
on it's time to get an archus like let's (79:26 - 79:29)
go Fest would be a good spot for it (79:28 - 79:31)
maybe like I don't know it's got the the (79:29 - 79:33)
forms maybe they want to do raids (79:31 - 79:36)
instead or something and have different (79:33 - 79:40)
forms like genc but we should get shiny (79:36 - 79:45)
Victini for Unova tour tour would be the (79:40 - 79:48)
yeah that would be the unless they do (79:45 - 79:50)
mowa or they do yeah well now they start (79:48 - 79:54)
to have like more options for that like (79:50 - 79:56)
because they have not released multiple (79:54 - 79:59)
shiny mythicals whereas in CNO they (79:56 - 80:03)
didn't release fion manfi and archus and (79:59 - 80:05)
they already had given us dark rry shiny (80:03 - 80:07)
it' already given us that was it dark (80:05 - 80:08)
rry shiny so it had you know it was gon (80:07 - 80:13)
to be Shaman um but yeah now now (80:08 - 80:15)
anything now it's anybody's guess is how (80:13 - 80:17)
they're going to go forward with because (80:15 - 80:22)
Tran verian and coelan should be the the (80:17 - 80:26)
runners in Unova cuz they technically (80:22 - 80:28)
appear in the Overworld for whatever (80:26 - 80:31)
that they don't run they just stand (80:28 - 80:34)
there yeah kind of black two white two I (80:31 - 80:35)
think they stand there I think they (80:34 - 80:37)
appear certain grass patches in black (80:35 - 80:38)
and (80:37 - 80:41)
white um they didn't do anamor I mean I (80:38 - 80:42)
know they did it for Valentine's Day but (80:41 - 80:44)
they didn't do it for um something (80:42 - 80:46)
during the c tour since they did (80:44 - 80:49)
everything else is soie during the uh (80:46 - 80:50)
cotor kind of weird that they didn't (80:49 - 80:53)
like it was too soon I guess too soon (80:50 - 80:54)
but they did it they released in this is (80:53 - 80:56)
a completely different conversation but (80:54 - 80:58)
they released that in a bad way like I (80:56 - 81:01)
get it and I got one and it's fine but (80:58 - 81:05)
like come on Wednesday like 1100 a.m. 1 (81:01 - 81:07)
p.m. on a Wednesday they also had a 600 (81:05 - 81:09)
p.m. one on a (81:07 - 81:12)
Wednesday 6 p.m. time slot I had to go (81:09 - 81:14)
to the 500 p.m. and then yeah there was (81:12 - 81:17)
the 600 p.m. after and that's fine and I (81:14 - 81:19)
get it but (81:17 - 81:21)
like I don't know that's a different (81:19 - 81:23)
that's a different podcast episode speak (81:21 - 81:25)
of mythicals (81:23 - 81:28)

something else to the ticket as (83:42 - 83:46)

else maybe it's just the research it's (83:46 - 83:50)
just that you're getting more (83:48 - 83:52)

yeah okay uh there will be showcase as (83:54 - 83:58)
well and a collection challenge does it (83:57 - 84:01)
say what is it going to be (83:58 - 84:03)
zerud uh zerud is free the first time (84:01 - 84:04)
though right because it was a movie (84:03 - 84:08)
promotion yes along with shiny (84:04 - 84:11)
celab yes because that's yeah why that's (84:08 - 84:13)
why it didn't that's why jodo tour (84:11 - 84:16)
didn't lead to a shiny celby afterwards (84:13 - 84:18)
because they had already released it (84:16 - 84:21)
prior versus the rest of theour to chiny (84:18 - 84:23)
celby appears for about four seconds in (84:21 - 84:26)
that entire movie well it's fine we all (84:23 - 84:29)
got a shiny Cel out of it so weird I'll (84:26 - 84:32)
take it uh is that the same way with the (84:29 - 84:36)
zerah Ora in zerah Ora was a little more (84:32 - 84:39)
involved yeah but Lugia shows up for (84:36 - 84:40)
about four seconds that's sorry that's (84:39 - 84:43)
me Lugia yeah they like promoted it with (84:40 - 84:45)
Lugia being the whole thing and then (84:43 - 84:47)
yeah that's cuz they knew Lugia would (84:45 - 84:49)
put butts into seats people are like (84:47 - 84:51)
what the Zer Ora thing what are you (84:49 - 84:55)
talking about Zer or is a gem I love Z (84:51 - 84:57)
cool it's amazing but I still don't feel (84:55 - 85:01)
like zoraa exists it has I know it (84:57 - 85:04)
hasn't really like had much of a of a of (85:01 - 85:06)
a Time although oh no CU Mar Shadow yeah (85:04 - 85:10)
it yeah it's in unite that's about it it (85:06 - 85:13)
is got a shiny one in home yeah you can (85:10 - 85:17)
put pants on it and unite nice that's (85:13 - 85:19)
the that's when you know Pokemon's made (85:17 - 85:22)
it when it we (85:19 - 85:28)
clothes I I feel like $799 is a lot (85:22 - 85:32)
mhm I I feel like $799 is a lot and it (85:28 - 85:33)
wasn't really (85:32 - 85:35)
promoted in a way that's like you're (85:33 - 85:37)
getting it's a mythical Pokemon and (85:35 - 85:39)
they're like e for eight bucks he get a (85:37 - 85:42)
rude it's like (85:39 - 85:45)
okay I don't know I just why is it just (85:42 - 85:49)
not $4.99 like why why 7.9 do we (85:45 - 85:52)
remember how much the CIO ticket was CIO (85:49 - 85:55)
was $7.99 same yeah yeah and Mr M the Mr (85:52 - 85:57)
mime was (85:55 - 86:01)
$77.99 the legendary Mr Ryme for (85:57 - 86:04)
$7.99 okay at least for the Mr mime and (86:01 - 86:06)
for the Celio I think both of those came (86:04 - 86:09)
with poses right Mr M for sure came with (86:06 - 86:11)
a pose right because the poses are (86:09 - 86:12)
typically what five bucks when they're (86:11 - 86:15)
on their own which (86:12 - 86:18)
uh you know take from that what you will (86:15 - 86:21)
but uh does so that the rude one doesn't (86:18 - 86:25)
come with a post no no I don't think (86:21 - 86:28)
one did either did the Kell one not come (86:25 - 86:29)
with one one (86:28 - 86:33)
incense incense itic is so generous one (86:29 - 86:35)
incense yeah I'm looking at the CIO (86:33 - 86:38)
research right now um no post for (86:35 - 86:40)
that it's really making Mr mime look (86:38 - 86:41)
like the better deal here no you got a (86:40 - 86:44)
t-shirt for the CIO one oh you got a (86:41 - 86:46)
t-shirt see that's that's okay t-shirt (86:44 - 86:48)
that's a is a good t-shirt and a met (86:46 - 86:50)
where's my where's my t-shirt oh and you (86:48 - 86:53)
got two super incubators for the K one (86:50 - 86:57)
too yeah not the super incubators I mean (86:53 - 87:00)
the value and you got some TMS you got (86:57 - 87:02)
two incense oh and three regular (87:00 - 87:03)
incubators they actually got some good (87:02 - 87:05)
stuff on the K I got that ticket that's (87:03 - 87:07)
why I got that ticket it was not that (87:05 - 87:09)
bad decent stuff on the CIO one and a (87:07 - 87:12)
bunch of rare candy you got like 15 or a (87:09 - 87:14)
candy or (87:12 - 87:16)
something yeah I get it it's a free- (87:14 - 87:17)
to-play game you got to you got to keep (87:16 - 87:19)
it alive with micro transactions that's (87:17 - 87:22)
not my complaint like I'm okay with (87:19 - 87:24)
buying things that feel like I have (87:22 - 87:26)
something to (87:24 - 87:29)
do I spend like $10 a month probably (87:26 - 87:31)
maybe 15 a month on Pokemon go which is (87:29 - 87:32)
cheaper than like a World of Warcraft (87:31 - 87:36)
subscription or a Final Fantasy (87:32 - 87:38)
14 I just think that this is really (87:36 - 87:41)
expensive for something that they (87:38 - 87:44)
technically gave away for free which is (87:41 - 87:45)
like if you want another zerude that's (87:44 - 87:47)
fine and if you weren't playing at the (87:45 - 87:50)
time obviously you don't have it yeah (87:47 - 87:54)
but it just it was only around for a (87:50 - 87:56)
week it's a strong Pokemon I think (87:54 - 87:58)
people still I use it for I actually use (87:56 - 88:00)
it for raids quite a bit like as my (87:58 - 88:03)
grass type um as my grass type Pokemon (88:00 - 88:04)
because I have a pretty good one so I (88:03 - 88:08)
powered it up um but I really like (88:04 - 88:11)
zerude and I think that it's it's cool (88:08 - 88:15)
that it's a mythical Pokemon and I mean (88:11 - 88:17)
people are consistently paying for (88:15 - 88:19)
mythical Pokemon one way or the other I (88:17 - 88:21)
mean how many Muse have you bought like (88:19 - 88:23)
between you know the Pokeball plus and (88:21 - 88:25)
all those you know all the other stuff (88:23 - 88:28)
like uh yeah eight bucks is steep though (88:25 - 88:31)
I I I kind of agree eight bucks is it's (88:28 - 88:33)
kind of a weird price um especially when (88:31 - 88:35)
it's like sitting next to like the (88:33 - 88:36)
marshadow ticket which is like here's a (88:35 - 88:39)
whole two-day event for 15 bucks and (88:36 - 88:43)
this is like here's one Pokemon two (88:39 - 88:45)
premium basses one again like they (88:43 - 88:47)
didn't I don't feel like they marketed (88:45 - 88:49)
it not that like we all can agree their (88:47 - 88:51)
marketing of the ultra Beast was better (88:49 - 88:53)
than anything they've ever done and so (88:51 - 88:55)
like everything else is not been I feel (88:53 - 88:57)
like as good as Ultra Beast marketing (88:55 - 88:59)
but uh as a mythical Pokemon I feel like (88:57 - 89:01)
they would have wanted to like I don't (88:59 - 89:03)
know put out a little unless I missed it (89:01 - 89:04)
put out a clip like with zerude or (89:03 - 89:06)
something you don't want their Clips (89:04 - 89:07)
anymore their Clips are just the (89:06 - 89:09)
standard Pokemon animation walking (89:07 - 89:12)
around on on top of on top of a photo of (89:09 - 89:14)
the outside it's I know it's like they (89:12 - 89:17)
just people they laid off one one of (89:14 - 89:20)
those were the video people oh multiple (89:17 - 89:22)
I'm sure cuz the the ultra Beast videos (89:20 - 89:23)
were really good and now they're really (89:22 - 89:26)
not it was wonderful to watch those (89:23 - 89:28)
Ultra Beast videos but uh but still I (89:26 - 89:30)
you know I I feel like it was still it's (89:28 - 89:32)
still weird to have like a mythical (89:30 - 89:33)
Pokemon and then to just be like and (89:32 - 89:35)
eight bucks for this mythical Pokemon (89:33 - 89:37)
and it was just like okay great thanks (89:35 - 89:39)
that's yeah zerude is kind of awesome (89:37 - 89:41)
but yeah that's (89:39 - 89:45)
sure um before before we wrap up uh the (89:41 - 89:46)
last thing they did in Pokemon go this (89:45 - 89:50)
week was uh some people have gotten a (89:46 - 89:53)
new character customization thing uh (89:50 - 89:57)
Bobby you did did you get that I haven't (89:53 - 89:59)
no I haven't I I I was one of the early (89:57 - 90:01)
people to get the backgrounds um when (89:59 - 90:03)
that was a thing but I haven't gotten (90:01 - 90:05)
the uh I didn't get the character (90:03 - 90:07)
customization yet Hannah do you have new (90:05 - 90:10)
background nope no new backgrounds no (90:07 - 90:11)
character customization I don't have new (90:10 - 90:13)
background oh okay because a lot more (90:11 - 90:16)
people got them like Friday I want to (90:13 - 90:18)
say like I know a lot of a lot of other (90:16 - 90:19)
people have started getting the new (90:18 - 90:21)
backgrounds yeah it's starting to roll (90:19 - 90:25)
out but yeah but (90:21 - 90:28)
uh I I am by far niantic's favorite (90:25 - 90:30)
child they do they (90:28 - 90:31)
they they probably listen to this (90:30 - 90:33)
podcast they're like why why do we give (90:31 - 90:35)
this guy free stuff every now and then (90:33 - 90:38)
um no I don't have new backgrounds uh I (90:35 - 90:41)
got the revive all a week after la which (90:38 - 90:43)
was a bummer because that would have (90:41 - 90:47)
been very useful in La um I don't have (90:43 - 90:50)
character customization I um I still (90:47 - 90:52)
think the and I could be wrong on this (90:50 - 90:53)
now that more people have it there's (90:52 - 90:57)
more uh data but it felt like when I had (90:53 - 91:00)
the um New backgrounds early on it was (90:57 - 91:02)
location based because I'd be sitting at (91:00 - 91:03)
home and I'd have the new background or (91:02 - 91:05)
I'd go to the park nearby I'd have the (91:03 - 91:07)
new background and then I'd go over (91:05 - 91:09)
10-minute drive over to the beach and I (91:07 - 91:11)
didn't have the new background anymore (91:09 - 91:13)
and like my wife also has the new (91:11 - 91:15)
background when she's sitting here so it (91:13 - 91:17)
does seem like there is some kind of (91:15 - 91:19)
location something to it as well and (91:17 - 91:22)
then obviously when c tour happened um I (91:19 - 91:23)
think because of the way that they did (91:22 - 91:25)
the sky and everything I think they just (91:23 - 91:26)
took the background they just did the (91:25 - 91:27)
new they just did away with the new (91:26 - 91:30)
backgrounds all together um and then (91:27 - 91:31)
yeah they came back for me about two (91:30 - 91:33)
weeks ago and then a bunch of people (91:31 - 91:36)
have been getting them within the last (91:33 - 91:38)
few days so I think it's really kind of (91:36 - 91:39)
rolling out now it seems like it's (91:38 - 91:41)
starting to roll out but I'm also still (91:39 - 91:43)
hearing some things about some lag and (91:41 - 91:46)
some bugginess with them so didn't have (91:43 - 91:49)
that when I first before cotour I never (91:46 - 91:51)
experienced any lag any bugginess with (91:49 - 91:53)
it and then when it came back a couple (91:51 - 91:56)
weeks ago it is there is a little more (91:53 - 91:58)
lag to it and stuff and maybe it's part (91:56 - 92:01)
of like more people I don't know what (91:58 - 92:02)
would cause it but it definitely didn't (92:01 - 92:04)
have it before cotor and then now there (92:02 - 92:06)
is a little bit more lagginess and (92:04 - 92:08)
bugginess to it since (92:06 - 92:12)
cotor huh so I don't know who knows I (92:08 - 92:13)
look forward to getting them and I'm (92:12 - 92:15)
enjoying all of the all of the new (92:13 - 92:17)
quality of life stuff we're (92:15 - 92:19)
getting yeah I think there's there's (92:17 - 92:22)
probably an argument to be made of like (92:19 - 92:24)
when are you going to fix all of these (92:22 - 92:26)
issues Niantic or like all of these like (92:24 - 92:28)
little things like I don't think that (92:26 - 92:30)
there's probably not there's always one (92:28 - 92:31)
I'm sure there's somebody listening to (92:30 - 92:33)
the show right now there's but like when (92:31 - 92:35)
you say like oh they added a revive all (92:33 - 92:37)
and a heal all like if you haven't (92:35 - 92:39)
played Pogo in like two years that's not (92:37 - 92:41)
going to bring you back oh finally (92:39 - 92:43)
revive all let me reinstall the game (92:41 - 92:46)
like those the features they're doing (92:43 - 92:48)
are super nice for somebody who plays (92:46 - 92:52)
the game every day um but like new (92:48 - 92:55)
features do bring back people like so (92:52 - 92:58)
when you you do something like Party (92:55 - 93:00)
play Maybe Party play is a bad example (92:58 - 93:03)
but it's it's (93:00 - 93:06)
like it's like big enough routes or (93:03 - 93:09)
routes um the like features bring back (93:06 - 93:12)
new people right uh like your quality of (93:09 - 93:14)
life stuff not so much but it does feel (93:12 - 93:17)
like this year they have been focusing (93:14 - 93:18)
on quality of life and I don't think (93:17 - 93:20)
that has anything to do with like raid (93:18 - 93:22)
pass changes or something went wrong and (93:20 - 93:24)
they have to like quickly roll these out (93:22 - 93:26)
is probably just things they've been (93:24 - 93:28)
working on that they're finally done and (93:26 - 93:31)
they're pushing them out and I'm (93:28 - 93:33)
assuming there will still be one new big (93:31 - 93:35)
feature this summer because Summer is (93:33 - 93:36)
normally when they roll out the big (93:35 - 93:38)
feature I don't know why they felt like (93:36 - 93:41)
they needed to do routes and party play (93:38 - 93:42)
and what was the other thing they did (93:41 - 93:45)
last year colle collection challenges (93:42 - 93:47)
collection challenges but we've gotten (93:45 - 93:49)
the adventure of chall showcases sorry (93:47 - 93:51)
the showcases oh okay I was we've had (93:49 - 93:53)
those for a while but we've gotten the (93:51 - 93:55)
adventure effects this year so far so (93:53 - 93:57)
there hasn't been nothing yeah that's (93:55 - 94:00)
true there hasn't been nothing true um I (93:57 - 94:03)
wonder if this year's like Z moves (94:00 - 94:04)
especially (94:03 - 94:08)
since what's it called is uh very Sun (94:04 - 94:11)
and Moon based what's it called you you (94:08 - 94:12)
know that Summer Event you know that (94:11 - 94:16)
what's it thingy go Fest yeah that's uh (94:12 - 94:18)
it's really exciting that it's it do you (94:16 - 94:20)
think it's they just cuz it's like kind (94:18 - 94:21)
of weird that they went and skipped to (94:20 - 94:23)
alola for that like kind of theme but (94:21 - 94:26)
maybe cuz world is in Hawaii and it just (94:23 - 94:28)
wanted to kind of connect those two (94:26 - 94:30)
things in some way to each other yeah (94:28 - 94:32)
yeah I I I don't think I mean I (94:30 - 94:34)
appreciate it love alola so it's like (94:32 - 94:38)
I'm all for it but also also like gen (94:34 - 94:43)
five is a really big Pokedex right (94:38 - 94:46)
um they all next year they have all next (94:43 - 94:48)
year especially with the inovator they (94:46 - 94:49)
could like push a (94:48 - 94:52)
whole year of Unova stuff I feel like (94:49 - 94:54)
especially because how big that Pok is (94:52 - 94:57)
and how it's not connected that's what (94:54 - 95:00)
the rumor said oh okay well there you go (94:57 - 95:04)
how could they all be wrong um yeah no I (95:00 - 95:05)
don't I mean I also thought it was weird (95:04 - 95:07)
that they went super heavy on Ultra (95:05 - 95:09)
beast at like a random time like there (95:07 - 95:12)
was no Rhyme or Reason that they spent (95:09 - 95:15)
so long promoting Ultra Beast they had (95:12 - 95:16)
those videos and they're like we got to (95:15 - 95:18)
put them out we got to get this going (95:16 - 95:19)
because these videos are so good we (95:18 - 95:21)
gotta get no I I didn't I didn't really (95:19 - 95:23)
make that connection until you said that (95:21 - 95:25)
Bobby though but like they pushed (95:23 - 95:29)
zachian and zamazenta during worlds (95:25 - 95:33)
London yeah and so like doing a Lola (95:29 - 95:35)
Pokemon for the year that they're going (95:33 - 95:39)
to Hawaii does make a lot of sense like (95:35 - 95:42)
it's yeah like I don't like that that (95:39 - 95:45)
would be a real weird coincidence like (95:42 - 95:48)
ntic it's not a it's not a coincidence (95:45 - 95:53)
this giant this giant uh business it's (95:48 - 95:56)
like that wants to connect everything to (95:53 - 95:59)
each other in one way or another there's (95:56 - 96:01)
definitely something to that although I (95:59 - 96:03)
still have no idea why with worlds (96:01 - 96:05)
having been in the UK they didn't give (96:03 - 96:08)
us the starters for Galler where are the (96:05 - 96:11)
starters for Galler in Pokemon go like (96:08 - 96:14)
come on it's been so long we've got (96:11 - 96:16)
everything else we don't have everything (96:14 - 96:19)
else well I mean start have corvite we (96:16 - 96:22)
starter oh we don't have corvite we'll (96:19 - 96:23)
get well that'll be a Comm we'll have (96:22 - 96:25)
like a rookie Community Day at some and (96:23 - 96:26)
I'm looking forward to it yeah that'll (96:25 - 96:28)
be a good one for sure one day yeah I (96:26 - 96:29)
think I think there's also an argument (96:28 - 96:32)
to be made that like the character (96:29 - 96:34)
customization is (96:32 - 96:38)
like eight years too late yeah like I I (96:34 - 96:39)
don't know like I'm glad think it's (96:38 - 96:41)
going to bring people back you think (96:39 - 96:42)
it's good enough to bring people back (96:41 - 96:44)
it's going to bring some people back I (96:42 - 96:47)
think that could people yes I agree with (96:44 - 96:48)
Hannah on that I think it could bring (96:47 - 96:51)
people back yeah I think that character (96:48 - 96:54)
customization that is free mhm (96:51 - 96:57)
like this going to bring people back (96:54 - 96:59)
depending on how good it is that's true (96:57 - 97:01)
it might not be amazing but people like (96:59 - 97:03)
it when they can customize their (97:01 - 97:05)
characters more yeah and having most of (97:03 - 97:07)
it so far be paid stuff isn't quite the (97:05 - 97:09)
same as being able to actually (97:07 - 97:11)
potentially make your character look (97:09 - 97:14)
like you or look more like what you want (97:11 - 97:17)
your your avatar to look like yeah oh (97:14 - 97:19)
don't get me wrong I heads or beards (97:17 - 97:22)
though is what I'm hearing so not (97:19 - 97:23)
everybody's going to make their (97:22 - 97:25)
character look like them they're getting (97:23 - 97:27)
there but I I think I think character (97:25 - 97:30)
customization is really important I (97:27 - 97:32)
think it I think to play a game and to (97:30 - 97:34)
put so much time and energy and even (97:32 - 97:36)
like eight years into a game to make it (97:34 - 97:38)
feel like your character looks like you (97:36 - 97:40)
and that is you like that's one of the (97:38 - 97:41)
reasons why I don't like Omega Ruby (97:40 - 97:43)
Alpha Sapphire and I know it's like a (97:41 - 97:44)
silly reason to some people but when you (97:43 - 97:47)
had a really good character (97:44 - 97:49)
customization in X and Y where you could (97:47 - 97:50)
be white (97:49 - 97:53)
black kind of like Latino okay there's (97:50 - 97:56)
like like four skin colors but you know (97:53 - 97:58)
more than better they started somewhere (97:56 - 98:02)
right um but to be able to (97:58 - 98:05)
be like cut like pick your skin color (98:02 - 98:08)
pick your clothes make it feel more like (98:05 - 98:11)
you and then go into auras afterwards (98:08 - 98:13)
and be like I'm just I'm just Brendan (98:11 - 98:15)
and may like that kind of suck it did (98:13 - 98:18)
feel like a huge step back um and I know (98:15 - 98:19)
for like people who played Animal (98:18 - 98:22)
Crossing uh especially people of color (98:19 - 98:24)
to be like oh I can now actually be my (98:22 - 98:26)
skin color instead of what I can't (98:24 - 98:30)
believe like out in the sun for days (98:26 - 98:32)
that was like the suggestion from the (98:30 - 98:34)
community oh you want a darker skin (98:32 - 98:35)
color uh just have your character stand (98:34 - 98:38)
in the Sun so they would get tan oh (98:35 - 98:41)
that's that was Animal Crossing that was (98:38 - 98:44)
Animal Crossing for like what 16 years (98:41 - 98:47)
however old Animal Crossing (98:44 - 98:50)
is like it's crazy to think that the (98:47 - 98:51)
switch version was the first animal (98:50 - 98:54)
crossing that added different SK skin (98:51 - 98:57)
colors actually crazy to think about um (98:54 - 99:00)
so yeah I think like being able to look (98:57 - 99:03)
like you height weight whatever I think (99:00 - 99:06)
is is great I don't know if that's (99:03 - 99:08)
enough to bring people (99:06 - 99:12)
back because it's such an old (99:08 - 99:15)
game um but it's it's cool if it is like (99:12 - 99:18)
I'd be very curious if people like if (99:15 - 99:20)
like comments or in our slack or Discord (99:18 - 99:21)
is like yeah I haven't played in a while (99:20 - 99:24)
but like character customization would (99:21 - 99:26)
would bring me back I feel like they at (99:24 - 99:27)
least check it out and if they haven't (99:26 - 99:29)
played in a while they'd be like whoa (99:27 - 99:31)
there's a lot going on here yeah other (99:29 - 99:32)
stuff in the game too it might not bring (99:31 - 99:34)
a lot of people back but I think it'll (99:32 - 99:36)
bring some people back and it's clearly (99:34 - 99:40)
making people excited and happy yeah (99:36 - 99:43)
more I'm a bit annoyed because I have (99:40 - 99:48)
had short hair for years years before uh (99:43 - 99:50)
Pokémon go came out and now that I am (99:48 - 99:51)
finally intentionally growing out my (99:50 - 99:54)
hair longer now I'm going to be able to (99:51 - 99:57)
have short hair in game like model won't (99:54 - 100:00)
match me I'll match my (99:57 - 100:03)
model that's how I'll I'll look the same (100:00 - 100:06)
uh yeah so that's that's rolling (100:03 - 100:09)
out um again I don't know why this would (100:06 - 100:13)
take as long as it did uh for like why (100:09 - 100:14)
did it take eight years for character (100:13 - 100:16)
customization okay the first year they (100:14 - 100:18)
get a pass because the first year they (100:16 - 100:19)
were like actually trying to make their (100:18 - 100:22)
game stable You could argue that they (100:19 - 100:24)
haven't since then but they at least (100:22 - 100:26)
that first year um but in other games (100:24 - 100:28)
like in Pikmin (100:26 - 100:31)
Bloom uh the character customization was (100:28 - 100:33)
pretty good uh you could like be your me (100:31 - 100:35)
character that was like the Nintendo (100:33 - 100:37)
integration but at least when it came to (100:35 - 100:38)
clothes like you could buy whatever you (100:37 - 100:40)
want like if you were a dude you could (100:38 - 100:41)
just buy like the sundress and put it on (100:40 - 100:43)
right away if you were a girl you could (100:41 - 100:46)
buy like the men's leather jacket or (100:43 - 100:48)
like there was no what I'm saying is (100:46 - 100:50)
like there was no restrictions in Pik (100:48 - 100:53)
Bloom um so it's not that Niantic didn't (100:50 - 100:55)
how to do that I would assume those (100:53 - 100:58)
restrictions came from the Pokemon (100:55 - 101:00)
company or whatever yeah the models in (100:58 - 101:02)
Pikmin Bloom are also a little easier (101:00 - 101:05)
and the m models already existed and (101:02 - 101:07)
yeah yeah (101:05 - 101:10)
yeah yeah I think in Pokemon it has (101:07 - 101:12)
probably had to take more effort along (101:10 - 101:14)
with the fact that they're they're (101:12 - 101:16)
actually adding other body types which (101:14 - 101:18)
that isn't always an option for (101:16 - 101:20)
character customization and I think that (101:18 - 101:22)
probably affected how long it took (101:20 - 101:24)
making all of that work with the the (101:22 - 101:27)
clothing models and all of that I'm very (101:24 - 101:30)
excited to see how bad the clipping is (101:27 - 101:31)
with different body types because the (101:30 - 101:33)
clipping already has not been great it's (101:31 - 101:36)
not great yeah that's feedback (101:33 - 101:38)
better that's feedback I gave to Niantic (101:36 - 101:41)
multiple times for the you whenever (101:38 - 101:43)
Niantic has had meetings I'm like it (101:41 - 101:46)
feels bad I still think this it feels (101:43 - 101:49)
bad to buy a shirt or a piece of (101:46 - 101:52)
clothing for $2 and for it to look (101:49 - 101:55)
terrible on your model MH like I want to (101:52 - 101:56)
give you money for clothing because I (101:55 - 101:59)
want to feel or look a s a certain way (101:56 - 102:02)
in a game I want to flex my eight years (101:59 - 102:05)
of playing this vet game and like I (102:02 - 102:08)
spent four $4.50 on this outfit and I (102:05 - 102:10)
can't wear it with my favorite boots or (102:08 - 102:12)
I can't wear it with a specific hat or (102:10 - 102:15)
like my mega bracelet is just clipping (102:12 - 102:19)
through the entire outfit it just that's (102:15 - 102:20)
the frustrating part I think when it (102:19 - 102:24)
comes to like giving buying stuff paying (102:20 - 102:25)
real money for stuff that like if it was (102:24 - 102:27)
all free you'd be like ah well whatever (102:25 - 102:31)
but like I bought this hat and my my (102:27 - 102:33)
eyelids are going through the rim of the (102:31 - 102:37)
hat like I we fix this yeah quick (102:33 - 102:40)
question as far as like spending sorry I (102:37 - 102:42)
interrupt um quick question as far as (102:40 - 102:45)
spending money in the game do either of (102:42 - 102:49)
you actually like actively go into gyms (102:45 - 102:52)
to collect the coins that way or do you (102:49 - 102:54)
are you more of I don't know that I've (102:52 - 102:55)
ever talked about this before this like (102:54 - 102:57)
I that I've ever talked about this on (102:55 - 102:58)
the show like or do you just get your (102:57 - 103:01)
coins through paying (102:58 - 103:01)
money because a lot of people obviously (103:01 - 103:07)
like are still free to play and do just (103:04 - 103:08)
collect the and I'm not saying that (103:07 - 103:10)
that's any better than spending like (103:08 - 103:11)
it's I'm not saying say you're better (103:10 - 103:13)
than us Bobby with your free coins I (103:11 - 103:16)
don't do the gym thing I'm saying like (103:13 - 103:19)
I'm saying uh that there are you know (103:16 - 103:20)
when you say like well we're paying (103:19 - 103:21)
money for this outfit it's like you're (103:20 - 103:23)
not always paying money you're still (103:21 - 103:24)
doing work though you're still putting (103:23 - 103:26)
work into like getting those coins which (103:24 - 103:28)
I think is also a reason that like these (103:26 - 103:30)
things should work well and not be a (103:28 - 103:33)
problem I was I'm just curious do either (103:30 - 103:35)
of you do gems to collect coins or do (103:33 - 103:38)
you usually just pay money if you're GNA (103:35 - 103:41)
like in the years that Pokémon go has (103:38 - 103:43)
been out there have been stretches of (103:41 - 103:46)
time where I have put a lot of gym (103:43 - 103:49)
battling in yeah that's not always the (103:46 - 103:51)
case it kind of depends on where I'm (103:49 - 103:54)
living uh right (103:51 - 103:56)
but one of the things I was going to say (103:54 - 103:57)
was that with the ace trainer outfit (103:56 - 103:59)
that you have to do a bunch of battles (103:57 - 104:02)
for I put so much effort into getting (103:59 - 104:05)
that outfit and the and the boots clip (104:02 - 104:08)
with every single pair of pants every (104:05 - 104:10)
single one for the most part I think (104:08 - 104:13)
there might be like two that they don't (104:10 - 104:15)
but yeah same kind of thing put a lot of (104:13 - 104:17)
effort into it and you want it to work (104:15 - 104:21)
yeah yeah that's that's unfortunate to (104:17 - 104:24)
answer your gy question there (104:21 - 104:28)
are where I live if I was to walk 5 (104:24 - 104:30)
minutes there are three gyms cuz there's (104:28 - 104:32)
like a bunch of restaurants over there (104:30 - 104:36)
and when I in the summer if I do nightly (104:32 - 104:39)
walks um I would usually take out those (104:36 - 104:42)
gyms my okay my priority of gyms is I (104:39 - 104:45)
will only take them out is if they're (104:42 - 104:47)
like one battle away from being taken (104:45 - 104:50)
out sure right if it's like blissy (104:47 - 104:53)
slacking Mel metal gar like if it's (104:50 - 104:56)
stacked not interested doesn't even (104:53 - 104:59)
cross my mind like it's not worth it now (104:56 - 105:01)
the exception to that is if I'm at a (104:59 - 105:04)
restaurant and I'm sitting down I will (105:01 - 105:06)
do that but if I'm like just doing like (105:04 - 105:10)
a nightly walk or whatever (105:06 - 105:12)
um if they're weak I will do them if (105:10 - 105:14)
they're not I'll skip them obviously if (105:12 - 105:16)
there's a free spot I'll do it Community (105:14 - 105:18)
Day I never take out gyms it's just too (105:16 - 105:20)
much time at these go fests or something (105:18 - 105:22)
I never take out gyms it's too much time (105:20 - 105:24)
plus they flip over like so fast at (105:22 - 105:25)
those like I don't know what the point (105:24 - 105:28)
is right um but in the summer I almost (105:25 - 105:31)
get 50 coins every single day because (105:28 - 105:33)
like I'm I actively I was like I need to (105:31 - 105:35)
leave I work at home I need to like get (105:33 - 105:37)
out for 10 15 minutes I need to like (105:35 - 105:40)
walk or go somewhere or like run to the (105:37 - 105:43)
run to like the the Mart down the street (105:40 - 105:44)
um but in the winter like I can't (105:43 - 105:46)
remember the last time I got 50 coins (105:44 - 105:50)
because yeah just I'm not going to like (105:46 - 105:52)
idle in my car to like take out a gym (105:50 - 105:53)
I'm sure there are some people that (105:52 - 105:56)
that's cool that's that's not me I think (105:53 - 105:59)
but I think to like reason I'm asking is (105:56 - 106:02)
for me if I'm taking a walk kind of same (105:59 - 106:03)
thing right like I work I work from home (106:02 - 106:05)
so like I got to get out and go take a (106:03 - 106:06)
walk throughout the day you know I can't (106:05 - 106:08)
just sit here all day um even though I (106:06 - 106:10)
do sometimes uh so like you know get out (106:08 - 106:12)
and get a walk but because I don't like (106:10 - 106:15)
battling right like I I don't like I (106:12 - 106:17)
like catching Pokemon that is my like (106:15 - 106:19)
the main thing I love doing catching and (106:17 - 106:20)
obviously taking pictures of Pokemon but (106:19 - 106:23)
I like catching them and if I have a (106:20 - 106:26)
15minute walk I don't want to spend five (106:23 - 106:28)
I'd rather spend all 15 minutes of that (106:26 - 106:31)
catching Pokemon I don't want to sit and (106:28 - 106:34)
battle a gym you know for a period of (106:31 - 106:36)
that time I want to just take my time to (106:34 - 106:38)
catch Pokemon I I just you know this is (106:36 - 106:40)
a bigger conversation but like it's like (106:38 - 106:42)
maybe time for them to have other ways (106:40 - 106:43)
of getting coins that aren't just (106:42 - 106:45)
battling in a gym because there's just (106:43 - 106:47)
so many different ways to play the game (106:45 - 106:49)
and it's like it'd be nice to be able to (106:47 - 106:51)
collect coins in a different way that (106:49 - 106:53)
doesn't include just battling since (106:51 - 106:55)
there are so many different aspects to (106:53 - 106:58)
the game um that aren't just battling in (106:55 - 107:00)
gyms initially sure there there was very (106:58 - 107:02)
little to the game catching battling and (107:00 - 107:03)
that was it and now there's just so much (107:02 - 107:05)
more out there that it just feels like (107:03 - 107:08)
there could be another way to collect (107:05 - 107:10)
coins you say that and then it's going (107:08 - 107:12)
to end up being showcases which neither (107:10 - 107:13)
of us (107:12 - 107:16)
do I love showcases I I've started (107:13 - 107:19)
trying more because of that Pikachu that (107:16 - 107:22)
you get at the 100 wins or whatever but (107:19 - 107:24)
yeah the showcases are tough in my area (107:22 - 107:26)
because it's just so many there's always (107:24 - 107:28)
100 trainers in the thing and I'm always (107:26 - 107:31)
number like 18 or 19 and I transferred (107:28 - 107:33)
all my double XL Pokemon six months ago (107:31 - 107:35)
because I was like oh this is taking up (107:33 - 107:37)
too much room and (107:35 - 107:41)
I'm an extra extra large it's ruining my (107:37 - 107:44)
economy right now I have too many but I (107:41 - 107:47)
I will win these (107:44 - 107:49)
showcases yeah I think uh you know (107:47 - 107:51)
talking about things like eight eight (107:49 - 107:53)
years to do character customization the (107:51 - 107:55)
current gym structure we have is like (107:53 - 107:56)
what six years old and hasn't changed (107:55 - 107:58)
since I like it probably does need a (107:56 - 108:00)
revamp (107:58 - 108:02)
um again I don't know if like slightly (108:00 - 108:04)
tweaking or revamping the gym would (108:02 - 108:06)
bring people back compared to like (108:04 - 108:09)
something new like Z moves or or whatnot (108:06 - 108:11)
but I just I think other ways of (108:09 - 108:13)
collecting coins I think other way (108:11 - 108:15)
because that is something people (108:13 - 108:16)
obviously like you want to get the (108:15 - 108:18)
customizations you don't want to pay for (108:16 - 108:20)
that and all that and there's you know (108:18 - 108:21)
there are things you can buy you know (108:20 - 108:22)
real things you buy with those coins and (108:21 - 108:24)
so I think I am sure there are people (108:22 - 108:27)
who have stopped playing because the gym (108:24 - 108:30)
mechanic to get coins was just too much (108:27 - 108:32)
work yeah and it's like just any other (108:30 - 108:34)
way of like collecting it doesn't have (108:32 - 108:36)
to be as many coins as the gym but just (108:34 - 108:38)
another way to collect something so it (108:36 - 108:40)
feels like I can do that without having (108:38 - 108:43)
to go if I'm on a walk to have to stop (108:40 - 108:46)
sit and like battle six Pokemon to put (108:43 - 108:48)
my Pokemon in to hopefully that it stays (108:46 - 108:49)
there for the amount of time to get some (108:48 - 108:52)
coins before it's gone like let me keep (108:49 - 108:53)
walking around and doing some kind of (108:52 - 108:55)
catch thing to get coins or something (108:53 - 108:58)
along those lines but it'd be nice it (108:55 - 109:01)
would be nice that if the free box gave (108:58 - 109:04)
like five coins or like 10 coins cuz (109:01 - 109:06)
like that's the thing in Pokemon sleep (109:04 - 109:08)
like I got up to 2,000 gems in Pokemon (109:06 - 109:10)
sleep not because I bought I did buy (109:08 - 109:12)
gems one time but not because I bought (109:10 - 109:15)
gems was because like like that that is (109:12 - 109:18)
exciting to get like what does it do it (109:15 - 109:20)
does like five 10 and 20 I think (109:18 - 109:23)
diamonds I think 15 is an option too (109:20 - 109:26)
yeah and so like that's so like I I (109:23 - 109:27)
think getting like a Pokeball Biscuit's (109:26 - 109:29)
like yeah okay like I definitely will (109:27 - 109:31)
use this getting the the dream shards (109:29 - 109:33)
like yeah okay but like getting the gems (109:31 - 109:36)
is like oh like cool I got gems but (109:33 - 109:38)
Pokemon sleep is a new game I fully (109:36 - 109:40)
expect those free boxes to get worse (109:38 - 109:43)
over time no don't the go ones did (109:40 - 109:45)
remember the go ones they were coins but (109:43 - 109:47)
remember the go ones sometimes I (109:45 - 109:48)
remember the go ones where be like (109:47 - 109:50)
here's an incubator and I would post it (109:48 - 109:51)
and people were like you you you (109:50 - 109:54)
Photoshopped it like no that was the box (109:51 - 109:56)
today those were yeah they had some good (109:54 - 109:59)
boxes it was like what's happening like (109:56 - 110:01)
someone someone uh messed up and gave us (109:59 - 110:03)
good Stu but even if it was like five (110:01 - 110:05)
coins I would take that over like two (110:03 - 110:09)
raspberries and a Pokeball yeah there's (110:05 - 110:11)
almost no use to opening up the free (110:09 - 110:15)
gift in Pokemon go no I actually just (110:11 - 110:18)
gonna say this live uh I don't actually (110:15 - 110:19)
open the free gift in Pokemon go I have (110:18 - 110:21)
almost never opened the free gift in (110:19 - 110:23)
Pokemon go cuz I'm going to end up like (110:21 - 110:26)
I look with one spin of a poké stop yeah (110:23 - 110:28)
I have so many Pok stops around me I (110:26 - 110:30)
have so many I do have a bunch I don't (110:28 - 110:32)
have as many gyms but I have a bunch of (110:30 - 110:33)
Poké stops around me and if I take a (110:32 - 110:36)
walk I'm gonna end up TR like deleting (110:33 - 110:38)
that stuff out of my stuff anyway you (110:36 - 110:40)
know I mean obviously it's different per (110:38 - 110:42)
person but yeah I mean just give us one (110:40 - 110:44)
coin in those I don't need I don't need (110:42 - 110:46)
five coins one coin and you know that (110:44 - 110:48)
would get me to open that I mean that (110:46 - 110:50)
would you know that's something but yeah (110:48 - 110:52)
just something other than battling you (110:50 - 110:53)
know it can be something you have to (110:52 - 110:56)
work toward but it just there's got to (110:53 - 110:59)
be another way eight years (110:56 - 111:02)
in I don't know I I we usually rag on (110:59 - 111:04)
Niantic but I really do think the last (111:02 - 111:07)
couple months they have (111:04 - 111:07)
been decent in like trying to fix their (111:07 - 111:14)

also play their game daily right I mean (111:14 - 111:18)
I play this game more than any like I (111:16 - 111:20)
love Pokemon I still love Pokemon go (111:18 - 111:22)
yeah right and and they have done some (111:20 - 111:24)
really um cool things in the last few (111:22 - 111:27)
months and uh it it's nice to see some (111:24 - 111:30)
