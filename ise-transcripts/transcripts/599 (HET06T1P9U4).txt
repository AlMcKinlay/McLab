with me is (0:30 - 0:35)
Hannah I am (0:32 - 0:38)
here I it's a low Newsweek I don't know (0:35 - 0:39)
I'm here (0:38 - 0:42)
hi (0:39 - 0:44)
hello you know it is a light Newsweek (0:42 - 0:47)
but I I'm I think we have a good show (0:44 - 0:50)
lined up so good that Greg is also here (0:47 - 0:54)
I am also here next week the epilog (0:50 - 0:57)
comes out for and that lines up with our (0:54 - 0:59)
600 episode although we're not going to (0:57 - 1:00)
be talking about the epilog cuz that (0:59 - 1:02)
only gives people like three days to do (1:00 - 1:06)
it so we'll do it the next episode I'm (1:02 - 1:08)
pretty sure the Pokemon company says you (1:06 - 1:12)
have to beat like everything in order to (1:08 - 1:14)
experience that so but what do they (1:12 - 1:16)
Define as (1:14 - 1:19)
everything um they do have a concrete (1:16 - 1:23)
well yeah I think you actually have it (1:19 - 1:26)
there oh no I was just off the top of my (1:23 - 1:29)
head I think it's a way out which (1:26 - 1:31)
is the (1:29 - 1:34)
area zero first story line in Pala which (1:31 - 1:35)
gets you (1:34 - 1:39)
credits and then whatever the teal mask (1:35 - 1:41)
story is called I don't remember where (1:39 - 1:43)
it says to be continued that's how you (1:41 - 1:45)
know you beat it and in this one it (1:43 - 1:46)
would (1:45 - 1:51)
be Ed Sheeran's song part two yeah if (1:46 - 1:53)
you meet Ed Sheeran twice and then I (1:51 - 1:54)
think there's one other battle that you (1:53 - 1:56)
have to do or one other thing you have (1:54 - 1:57)
to (1:56 - 2:02)
experience and that's all yeah (1:57 - 2:03)
Ed shearan part (2:02 - 2:06)
two which apparently the second Ed (2:03 - 2:08)
shearan song is like remixed by Toby Fox (2:06 - 2:09)
I (2:08 - 2:11)
think I didn't listen to it because I (2:09 - 2:14)
couldn't on stream I had to mute it so I (2:11 - 2:15)
don't know what it sounds (2:14 - 2:18)
like I didn't want Mr both Ed Sheeran (2:15 - 2:22)
songs I don't (2:18 - 2:24)
know if (2:22 - 2:27)
you if you went back to kakami after (2:24 - 2:29)
credits then you (2:27 - 2:31)
did (2:29 - 2:33)
I think that you get the the second Edan (2:31 - 2:36)
song even before that (2:33 - 2:39)
yeah you get it before you go back to (2:36 - 2:42)
the lake yeah (2:39 - 2:45)
yeah I do not remember (2:42 - 2:49)
it I feel like you should remember do (2:45 - 2:54)
not I have successfully blocked that out (2:49 - 2:58)
like I I'm sure something happened if (2:54 - 3:00)
you I could not tell you that it was (2:58 - 3:03)
that Ed Sharon song I I couldn't tell (3:00 - 3:05)
you what it was a remix it was a remix (3:03 - 3:08)
it wasn't super identifiable as the same (3:05 - 3:11)
song I don't even remember what the song (3:08 - 3:13)
is because I muted it both times with (3:11 - 3:17)
all Ed Sheeran songs I know them while (3:13 - 3:20)
I'm listening to them and then 3 seconds (3:17 - 3:24)
after I could not tell you a thing about (3:20 - 3:27)
it I don't I know that I know the only (3:24 - 3:29)
one I remember is electric by Katy Perry (3:27 - 3:31)
because we talked about a lot and she (3:29 - 3:33)
just says electric a lot (3:31 - 3:35)
electric couldn't tell you what the edar (3:33 - 3:38)
song is I couldn't tell you what any Ed (3:35 - 3:40)
Ed Shar and post Malone I could not tell (3:38 - 3:42)
you what any of their songs sound like (3:40 - 3:44)
could (3:42 - 3:46)
not I like post Malone more than I like (3:44 - 3:49)
Ed Sharon but Ed sharan's a low bar I (3:46 - 3:52)
don't think Ed bar for the record I (3:49 - 3:54)
don't think I don't think he's bad just (3:52 - 3:58)
not my not my cup of (3:54 - 4:02)
tea um speak PFT uh let's talk about (3:58 - 4:04)
Pokemon sleep there's not any uh news (4:02 - 4:08)
here but I will say my my personal (4:04 - 4:13)
thought here is this 2024 event a bit (4:08 - 4:16)
disappointing compared to the other ones (4:13 - 4:18)
yeah a little bit I was disappointed (4:16 - 4:21)
that there weren't any special missions (4:18 - 4:23)
for the event in particular I like (4:21 - 4:25)
having the extra things to aim for on (4:23 - 4:28)
top of the weekly missions that you have (4:25 - 4:32)
regardless of what is going on (4:28 - 4:32)
I maxed out my (4:32 - 4:40)
pot oh the 45 or whatever 40 I don't (4:35 - 4:41)
know Maxes that out I think it's because (4:40 - 4:43)
I keep hitting the limit of my bag space (4:41 - 4:46)
for ingredients and I'm also up my (4:43 - 4:48)
ingredient bag and I'm like I just need (4:46 - 4:51)
to put more things in this (4:48 - 4:51)
pot or switch your team to you're not (4:51 - 4:57)
getting as many ingredients but all that (4:54 - 4:59)
means I have to choose which shiny to (4:57 - 5:01)
leave out and that is not happening (4:59 - 5:02)
right (5:01 - 5:05)
now that is not I need I also have a new (5:02 - 5:07)
Eevee in there because I'm got to do (5:05 - 5:12)
whatever million hours to get sylvon 150 (5:07 - 5:16)
hours it's like 15 days of (5:12 - 5:19)
sleep I hear you do it every day I do (5:16 - 5:22)
and I'm real good at (5:19 - 5:25)
it yeah (5:22 - 5:28)
Charizard you need a Charizard no I did (5:25 - 5:29)
get one I got all the keys oh you got (5:28 - 5:32)
one to up it I got all those things to (5:29 - 5:36)
up my one CH I got another Charmander (5:32 - 5:39)
and I have one that's I have all I just (5:36 - 5:40)
have to go in and actually hit the (5:39 - 5:43)
Evolve button to switch it over but I do (5:40 - 5:46)
have it now it's not shiny so it will (5:43 - 5:48)
never see the light of (5:46 - 5:52)
day I I don't I I'm I went to top Hollow (5:48 - 5:53)
because I wanted a good (5:52 - 5:56)
Charmander like I have an okay one it's (5:53 - 5:59)
not 98% unfortunately it's like a it's (5:56 - 6:02)
like a like an 80 86 um so I was like (5:59 - 6:03)
maybe I can get a better Charmander this (6:02 - 6:06)
week I am not getting a lot of (6:03 - 6:08)
Charmander I don't know how people on (6:06 - 6:11)
green grass or the beach are doing with (6:08 - 6:14)
their starter Pokemon but I woke up this (6:11 - 6:18)
morning to two Larvitar three Shuppet (6:14 - 6:19)
and an (6:18 - 6:23)
Eevee why am I here why am I on (6:19 - 6:25)
topollo for the shet in the Eevee of (6:23 - 6:28)
course I can get Eevee literally (6:25 - 6:30)
everywhere (6:28 - 6:34)
yeah I I admittedly missed a couple of (6:30 - 6:36)
days this week I was out of town with (6:34 - 6:38)
family at a beach so I was also on the (6:36 - 6:43)
beach in Pokemon sleep and maybe saw one (6:38 - 6:46)
Squirtle but mostly I was just too tired (6:43 - 6:47)
at the end of the day to press the (6:46 - 6:49)
button (6:47 - 6:49)
apparently if you had that premium (6:49 - 6:56)
membership one backward (6:52 - 6:59)
thing wait yeah cuz you you guys can't (6:56 - 7:01)
go back and re-record sleep right I will (6:59 - 7:04)
say it's not a it's not a great premium (7:01 - 7:06)
feature because you can only do it (7:04 - 7:10)
within like 24 hours of it happening (7:06 - 7:13)
that's still enough yeah but if you (7:10 - 7:16)
like if you're at like hour like (7:13 - 7:19)
26 it it'll just it's just like no like (7:16 - 7:22)
you've you've waited too long and if you (7:19 - 7:25)
like if you like took a nap like the day (7:22 - 7:27)
before but forgot to record the nap but (7:25 - 7:29)
you recorded like asleep you can't (7:27 - 7:31)
squeeze it in between like it's like (7:29 - 7:34)
you've already slept you can't go back (7:31 - 7:38)
and put time it's not like it's very (7:34 - 7:41)
very restrictive in in what you do which (7:38 - 7:42)
is (7:41 - 7:46)
whatever the think already lies as it (7:42 - 7:50)
is no I started cheating this week and I (7:46 - 7:55)
started I started I started pregaming my (7:50 - 7:58)
my Pokemon sleep so I I will pregame it (7:55 - 8:02)
on the dresser for like an hour because (7:58 - 8:05)
I'm in like bed and Tik Tok for an hour (8:02 - 8:08)
but um I've been in bed and Tik talk and (8:05 - 8:10)
as long as I'm sitting still I could (8:08 - 8:12)
care less it's like you're asleep no (8:10 - 8:13)
yeah yeah yeah no but I I need I I (8:12 - 8:16)
needed to specifically be (8:13 - 8:18)
slumbering I can't like because dozing (8:16 - 8:21)
on topalo is worse than three shuppets (8:18 - 8:26)
and two lvar dozing on on topalo is like (8:21 - 8:29)
Geodude City so I was like and the you (8:26 - 8:31)
can't get onx on dozing and I kept (8:29 - 8:32)
getting dozing all week or snoozing or (8:31 - 8:34)
whatever it is I was like I need (8:32 - 8:36)
slumbering I still have not gotten an (8:34 - 8:39)
onyx and I'm cheating CU all I want is (8:36 - 8:42)
an onx I think I have an (8:39 - 8:45)
onyx yeah cuz you're for sure slumbering (8:42 - 8:48)
Greg because you slam 800 milligrams of (8:45 - 8:52)
caffeine and then you're passed out yeah (8:48 - 8:55)
get out my I'm not pass (8:52 - 8:58)
out I got to cheat to tell the game I'm (8:55 - 9:00)
passed out just hopefully (8:58 - 9:03)
see do you know if it's giving you I (9:00 - 9:04)
guess you won't know until the end of (9:03 - 9:06)
the week if it's giving you a better (9:04 - 9:08)
rank for the week now that you're (9:06 - 9:10)
cheating now that I am cheating I (9:08 - 9:12)
testing to see if I will get better (9:10 - 9:14)
ranked because I sent Hannah and Greg my (9:12 - 9:16)
screenshot of the week which said I was (9:14 - 9:19)
what D or F or something and I was like (9:16 - 9:21)
I was like look at how consistent I was (9:19 - 9:25)
I went to B almost it was so consist (9:21 - 9:28)
don't don't let Greg let's compare who (9:25 - 9:30)
was consistent and got an that week and (9:28 - 9:33)
yeah but mine looked almost identical to (9:30 - 9:36)
yours and it was like d yeah no both of (9:33 - 9:39)
yours were very consistent mine was the (9:36 - 9:41)
least consistent and also I get the (9:39 - 9:44)
least sleep of all three of us by a good (9:41 - 9:46)
amount and I still got a B yeah Hannah's (9:44 - 9:48)
score was so much higher than mine and (9:46 - 9:51)
mine looked like Gregs Gregs was a mine (9:48 - 9:54)
was D and Hannah's was B I was like what (9:51 - 9:57)
am I doing (9:54 - 10:00)
wrong it clearly has a bias against (9:57 - 10:04)
people who sleep at any time that isn't (10:00 - 10:06)
societally (10:04 - 10:10)
accepted that isn't the societal (10:06 - 10:13)
Norm which isn't stated anywhere it's (10:10 - 10:16)
just in their programming somewhere I'm (10:13 - 10:17)
pretty convinced of that at this point (10:16 - 10:20)
so if you don't go to sleep at like 8:00 (10:17 - 10:23)
pm to (10:20 - 10:26)
midnight you'll just get a worse score (10:23 - 10:28)
automatically deducted (10:26 - 10:31)
points (10:28 - 10:34)
ah all right well I'll update you on my (10:31 - 10:36)
Pokemon sleep cheating next (10:34 - 10:39)
week I'm (10:36 - 10:41)

prize on the line I am selling you (11:01 - 11:07)
out (11:05 - 11:10)
DQ Let's uh let's switch gears over to (11:07 - 11:14)
some TCG stuff there are two top 10 list (11:10 - 11:17)
for TCG which I think are our fun to (11:14 - 11:21)
sell this is our our TCG wrapped our our (11:17 - 11:24)
year in review here um we got one from (11:21 - 11:26)
TCG player which is the top 10 most (11:24 - 11:30)
expensive Pokemon cards of 2023 and then (11:26 - 11:33)
uh the Japanese Pokemon website released (11:30 - 11:37)
the top 100 most searched for cards I'm (11:33 - 11:40)
not sure how they determined that or if (11:37 - 11:41)
that was like Google search or whatnot (11:40 - 11:44)
we can go through the top 10 though (11:41 - 11:47)
spoiler those two lists are (11:44 - 11:47)
different uh let's start with the TCG (11:47 - 11:53)
player stuff uh top 10 most expensive (11:50 - 11:54)
cards uh if you don't know what TC I (11:53 - 11:57)
think TCG player is now fully owned by (11:54 - 12:01)
eBay did that sale go through oh I don't (11:57 - 12:03)
remember if I don't know if did I think (12:01 - 12:06)
I think it did I think it did too they (12:03 - 12:09)
they didn't Rebrand I think but I think (12:06 - 12:12)
eBay now owns TCG player anyways TCG (12:09 - 12:14)
player I like their website I think (12:12 - 12:18)
their site is good (12:14 - 12:23)
uh completed $295 million purchase good (12:18 - 12:26)
Heavens I I would have sold to (12:23 - 12:31)
honestly you're not wrong s and move on (12:26 - 12:32)
all right uh the number 10 most (12:31 - 12:35)
expensive card of 2023 was Magikarp from (12:32 - 12:38)
Pala evolved that was (12:35 - 12:42)
the uh number 203 for $ (12:38 - 12:44)
56.84 that is the Magikarp with the (12:42 - 12:48)
black background of it swimming up the (12:44 - 12:53)
waterfall uh no surprises there with (12:48 - 12:55)
Magikarp uh this one is probably the (12:53 - 12:57)
biggest surprise on the list I don't (12:55 - 13:00)
remember this card ever coming out out (12:57 - 13:03)
this is uh the Squirtle Pokemon Center (13:00 - 13:07)
exclusive from scarlet and violet 151 uh (13:03 - 13:08)
it is (13:07 - 13:11)
$61.95 it's just a squirtle it with a (13:08 - 13:13)
little Pokemon Center stamp on it it's (13:11 - 13:16)
not like a full art it's not a (13:13 - 13:18)
alternative art it's just a little squir (13:16 - 13:22)
got that Pokemon Center stamp sure does (13:18 - 13:25)
that's what's important I don't REM (13:22 - 13:27)
where did like obviously this was a (13:25 - 13:30)
promotion for 151 I right cuz that's (13:27 - 13:33)
what it's from but like I don't (13:30 - 13:35)
remember I feel like I'm checking (13:33 - 13:37)
Pokemon Center so much I'm getting (13:35 - 13:39)
banned from that website at least a (13:37 - 13:42)
couple hours a week yeah I'm a Pokemon (13:39 - 13:44)
Center connoisseur I don't remember this (13:42 - 13:47)
promo at all being (13:44 - 13:49)
featured and they don't specifically say (13:47 - 13:52)
like my only guess is this was like the (13:49 - 13:54)
European Pokemon Center or the Canadian (13:52 - 13:56)
Pokemon Center I'm seeing it on the (13:54 - 13:58)
American (13:56 - 14:00)
one I'm actually seeing it on the (13:58 - 14:02)
website saying that you could receive it (14:00 - 14:05)
as a gift with each eligible (14:02 - 14:07)
item uh if you place an order that (14:05 - 14:10)
contains two scarlet and violet 151 (14:07 - 14:12)
Ultra premium collection you will (14:10 - 14:14)
receive two Squirtle cards as a gift so (14:12 - 14:16)
something something to do with that but (14:14 - 14:18)
I don't remember ever seeing the (14:16 - 14:20)
promotion when it was actually live I (14:18 - 14:22)
don't remember ever seeing that usually (14:20 - 14:23)
they're advertising on the front page (14:22 - 14:26)
normally of like get this card don't (14:23 - 14:28)
worry there's a card on here that makes (14:26 - 14:30)
Pokemon Center all worth it you won't (14:28 - 14:33)
believe what number one is I don't know (14:30 - 14:34)
if that's a true (14:33 - 14:39)
statement uh the the number eight is (14:34 - 14:43)
gutina V from Crown Zenith this is the (14:39 - 14:46)
the gallery car this is the secret rare (14:43 - 14:48)
all gold (14:46 - 14:51)
gutina (14:48 - 14:53)
um (14:51 - 14:56)
it's cool I guess if you like gutina (14:53 - 14:59)
people do it's not my favorite of the (14:56 - 15:02)
gutina cards but it is a cool one (14:59 - 15:04)
yeah uh we have number seven coming in (15:02 - 15:07)
is roaring Moon from Paradox Rift which (15:04 - 15:11)
is uh gtino was $71 roaring moon is (15:07 - 15:14)
$81 uh this is the the ancient roaring (15:11 - 15:18)
Moon um with the the scream tailes below (15:14 - 15:21)
it very cool card roaring Moon very cool (15:18 - 15:23)
Pokemon (15:21 - 15:27)
so that's cool this was the most (15:23 - 15:30)
expensive card in Jaan for a couple (15:27 - 15:32)
weeks it was going for $1,000 the (15:30 - 15:34)
Japanese version of it uh not going for (15:32 - 15:36)
$1,000 anymore from my understanding but (15:34 - 15:39)
the American version of iono from Pala (15:36 - 15:42)
evolved uh the full art version of her (15:39 - 15:43)
is going for (15:42 - 15:47)
$86 and 31 cents I think she (15:43 - 15:50)
single-handedly sold a lot of Pala (15:47 - 15:52)
evolved because people thought that the (15:50 - 15:55)
American version would also go for (15:52 - 15:58)
$1,000 as of today it is (15:55 - 16:01)
$86 (15:58 - 16:01)
uh coming in at number five not a (16:04 - 16:10)
surprise here either is an Umbreon card (16:07 - 16:14)
this is the EB Games exclusive which (16:10 - 16:16)
must be Canada or Australia because we (16:14 - 16:20)
don't have EB Games in America (16:16 - 16:23)
anymore uh but is the Umbreon EB Games (16:20 - 16:27)
exclusive from obsidian Flames going for (16:23 - 16:27)
$90 if you know nothing about TCG cards (16:28 - 16:32)
let me tell you two things number one (16:30 - 16:34)
Charizard is always worth the most (16:32 - 16:38)
number two for whatever reason Umbreon (16:34 - 16:42)
cards always very sought after I don't (16:38 - 16:45)
know who for whatever reason it's a very (16:42 - 16:47)
popular Pokemon right up there with (16:45 - 16:50)
Charizard yeah but it's never (16:47 - 16:53)
Espeon no it's never Espeon Umbreon is (16:50 - 16:57)
cooler I'm sorry it's it's never Espeon (16:53 - 17:00)
it's never Flareon jol it's only you (16:57 - 17:02)
know not even Sylveon gets the treatment (17:00 - 17:05)
Umbreon gets sometimes it does but this (17:02 - 17:07)
particular Umbreon card does have that (17:05 - 17:10)
EB Game stamp so similar to the Pokemon (17:07 - 17:12)
Center stamp on the Squirtle that makes (17:10 - 17:16)
it particularly sought (17:12 - 17:16)
after you won't believe the next three (17:17 - 17:22)
coming up here starting with the number (17:20 - 17:25)
four we have Charizard from the (17:22 - 17:29)
Charizard Pokemon TCG classic (17:25 - 17:31)
so you could spend (17:29 - 17:34)
$400 for the TCG classic remember that (17:31 - 17:36)
came out actually I think right now it's (17:34 - 17:40)
about $300 at Best Buy um you could (17:36 - 17:42)
spend $300 at Best Buy I guess to get (17:40 - 17:45)
the TCG classic and then your Charizard (17:42 - 17:48)
from that will be worth (17:45 - 17:50)
$109 (17:48 - 17:52)
although I still don't think that's a (17:50 - 17:54)
good (17:52 - 17:54)
invest like maybe I don't know feel like (17:55 - 17:59)
if you're buying the TCG classic I feel (17:58 - 18:01)
like you're buying it because you're a (17:59 - 18:03)
collector not a reseller I mean no don't (18:01 - 18:05)
get me wrong resellers bought it with (18:03 - 18:06)
the intent to make (18:05 - 18:09)
money uh but I don't think that's I (18:06 - 18:10)
don't know if that worked out for them (18:09 - 18:12)
since (18:10 - 18:14)
it's pretty easy to find a discounted (18:12 - 18:16)
now do we know how many times we've (18:14 - 18:21)
gotten this Nostalgia Charizard card oh (18:16 - 18:25)
God the same Charizard card at least (18:21 - 18:27)
every other year at this point yeah (18:25 - 18:31)
Charizard comes around a lot yeah if you (18:27 - 18:33)
if you didn't I sorry I did not describe (18:31 - 18:35)
it but Hannah did it is the Charizard (18:33 - 18:37)
that you expect it to be it is the it's (18:35 - 18:41)
the one from 28 years ago (18:37 - 18:43)
again you probably have fill a whole (18:41 - 18:46)
binder of different eras of this (18:43 - 18:48)
specific card I think they do that in (18:46 - 18:50)
Yu-Gi-Oh I think blue eyes white dragon (18:48 - 18:52)
is like constantly reprinted it's the (18:50 - 18:54)
same (18:52 - 18:57)
art um number three is the Charizard (18:54 - 19:00)
from 15 1 it is like the paper m√¢ch√© (18:57 - 19:03)
Charizard flying over the volcano it's (19:00 - 19:05)
like papier-m√¢ch√© if you look at (19:03 - 19:10)
it I don't know poster board it's like (19:05 - 19:11)
it looks like it's a little like paper (19:10 - 19:15)
that they stacked on other paper does it (19:11 - 19:17)
[Laughter] (19:15 - 19:21)
yeah it's very stylistic I can say that (19:17 - 19:24)
I for sure I thought my impression of (19:21 - 19:26)
this card was they were going for like a (19:24 - 19:29)
paperish like a like a hand a (19:26 - 19:30)
handcrafted (19:29 - 19:34)
Charizard some would (19:30 - 19:34)
say Craig's trying to form (19:36 - 19:40)
thoughts I'm trying to get figure out (19:38 - 19:44)
how you got papier-m√¢ch√© from this (19:40 - 19:44)
picture like I'm looking at it on a (19:45 - 19:49)
different website big and it's just a (19:47 - 19:52)
drawing it's like it's like (19:49 - 19:55)
soft it's like there's no like lines (19:52 - 19:56)
around (19:55 - 19:59)
it none of that is what paper m (19:56 - 20:01)
is (19:59 - 20:04)
like still art I don't understand what (20:01 - 20:08)
you're saying well he's going for (20:04 - 20:11)
$115 okay number (20:08 - 20:13)
three still staring at this thing I'm (20:11 - 20:16)
like what in the world are you talking (20:13 - 20:20)
about paper do you know what paper m√¢ch√© (20:16 - 20:25)
is the longer this goes on I don't think (20:20 - 20:25)
so number two most expensive card of (20:27 - 20:35)
2023 is another Charizard we're three (20:31 - 20:36)
for three for Charizards here this is (20:35 - 20:39)
the radiant Charizard radiant means (20:36 - 20:43)
shiny uh this is the radiant Charizard (20:39 - 20:47)
from the prize Pack series three which (20:43 - 20:49)
means has the little play Pokemon stamp (20:47 - 20:52)
on it um which was given out at some (20:49 - 20:54)
play Pokemon tournament I don't know (20:52 - 20:59)
which one uh prize Pack series three (20:54 - 21:00)
would make it seem that you probably had (20:59 - 21:03)
to come in like top eight or top 16 out (21:00 - 21:06)
of the tournament to receive this card (21:03 - 21:09)
um because it's a prize for winning (21:06 - 21:11)
normally that's usually what it is they (21:09 - 21:13)
it could be a card that they gave to all (21:11 - 21:15)
competitors at some point for just (21:13 - 21:16)
participating although I don't think (21:15 - 21:18)
we've had a tournament big enough this (21:16 - 21:22)
year for that to happen but I haven't (21:18 - 21:24)
been following that very closely so it's (21:22 - 21:29)
$130 though for the Charizard lovers out (21:24 - 21:34)
there um and finally our number one most (21:29 - 21:38)
expensive card of 2023 is Pikachu with (21:34 - 21:41)
the gray felt hat scarlet and violet (21:38 - 21:43)
promo number (21:41 - 21:49)
85 there he is yay we did it the the wor (21:43 - 21:51)
destroying a museum (21:49 - 21:55)
for it was worth breaking Pokemon Center (21:51 - 21:57)
multiple times (21:55 - 21:59)
for (21:57 - 22:04)
a a real a real remembrance of 2023 in a (21:59 - 22:08)
nutshell I'm looking at you might ask (22:04 - 22:10)
you might ask what did the most (22:08 - 22:14)
expensive card of 2023 come down to Mr (22:10 - 22:17)
Gray felt hat Pikachu is worth a (22:14 - 22:20)
whopping (22:17 - 22:20)
$146 that's (22:22 - 22:26)
it yeah these prices these I'm like oh (22:23 - 22:29)
these are cute prices person who has to (22:26 - 22:35)
buy magic cards I'm like a $150 that's (22:29 - 22:38)
nice (22:35 - 22:38)
it someone's getting pulled over (22:38 - 22:44)
um it's it's it's like not shocking to (22:41 - 22:47)
me at all with these prices I I think (22:44 - 22:48)
some people listening might be shocked (22:47 - 22:51)
to let like what what Greg just said (22:48 - 22:54)
like these prices are very cute when (22:51 - 22:57)
when I got into when I got back into the (22:54 - 22:58)
TCG (22:57 - 22:59)
which (22:58 - 23:03)
was um early Sun and Moon because I (22:59 - 23:05)
played for black and white and I played (23:03 - 23:06)
almost all of black and white dropped (23:05 - 23:09)
out at the end of Black 2 White 2 TCG (23:06 - 23:11)
era and then I skipped all of X and Y (23:09 - 23:14)
and then I got back in with sun and (23:11 - 23:16)
moon (23:14 - 23:19)
um almost every sing every single deck (23:16 - 23:20)
competitive deck at the time needed at (23:19 - 23:23)
least two tapu (23:20 - 23:26)
lelay and a lot of decks needed three (23:23 - 23:30)
tapu lelay and tapu itself was an $80 (23:26 - 23:33)
card no matter what what the how you (23:30 - 23:36)
spun it you needed two to three and it (23:33 - 23:38)
was $80 each and then eventually they (23:36 - 23:41)
put tapu Lele in tins like a year or two (23:38 - 23:42)
later and then you could easily walk (23:41 - 23:45)
into a Target get a tin for 15 bucks (23:42 - 23:49)
topele was featured on the tin and like (23:45 - 23:51)
that that is like a very common thing (23:49 - 23:53)
that happens in the TCG they'll like (23:51 - 23:55)
Pokemon will determine a card is really (23:53 - 23:58)
good and it's kind of expensive and it's (23:55 - 23:59)
preventing people from getting in and (23:58 - 24:02)
then they'll they'll tin it h and make (23:59 - 24:04)
it cheaper so it's more a more (24:02 - 24:06)
accessible game I don't like if you're a (24:04 - 24:08)
collector you're probably like oh but (24:06 - 24:10)
like hey they they want people to play (24:08 - 24:14)
their competitive TCG game and if you (24:10 - 24:16)
need 3380 cards that's not very (24:14 - 24:19)
accessible to some (24:16 - 24:20)
people (24:19 - 24:23)
so (24:20 - 24:23)
now when the pandemic happened and Vivid (24:24 - 24:30)
voltage and that stuff started selling (24:27 - 24:33)
out we started doing a video we started (24:30 - 24:35)
doing video podcasts at the time and I (24:33 - 24:38)
remember like will was on the show Greg (24:35 - 24:40)
we were talking about how like this is (24:38 - 24:42)
not sustainable and this was going to (24:40 - 24:44)
crash we were also talking about how (24:42 - 24:47)
like PSA is just people making up (24:44 - 24:49)
numbers and this this this has been (24:47 - 24:51)
proven time and time again and so we got (24:49 - 24:53)
two comments a lot on all our YouTube (24:51 - 24:55)
videos one was we don't know what we're (24:53 - 24:58)
talking about in regards to PSA which (24:55 - 25:01)
you're wrong you're literally just (24:58 - 25:04)
search PSA and Tik Tok and you will find (25:01 - 25:06)
videos of people getting a card back (25:04 - 25:09)
from PSA cracking it open resending it (25:06 - 25:11)
to PSA for a different score like you (25:09 - 25:14)
can find it over and over and over again (25:11 - 25:16)
do you know why over like yes they have (25:14 - 25:18)
machines that like line things up but at (25:16 - 25:20)
the end of the day it's still a guy (25:18 - 25:22)
standing there and if his girlfriend (25:20 - 25:23)
broke up with him the day before he's (25:22 - 25:26)
going to be like you know what Mr (25:23 - 25:28)
sending me eight Charizards none of them (25:26 - 25:30)
are going to be tens I'm just going to (25:28 - 25:32)
nine them all because like at the end of (25:30 - 25:34)
the day it's still a human grading it (25:32 - 25:36)
and we we've seen this time and time (25:34 - 25:38)
again of like I sent this to PSA six (25:36 - 25:40)
times and the sixth time they finally (25:38 - 25:42)
gave it a 10 like that's all they want (25:40 - 25:44)
there's such a huge difference in prices (25:42 - 25:48)
between a nine a PSA 9 and a PSA 10 and (25:44 - 25:50)
so it's worth it for them to spend the (25:48 - 25:52)
$30 to crack it open and send it back in (25:50 - 25:55)
over and over again to get that PSA 10 (25:52 - 25:59)
so haha I what what you want like PSA is (25:55 - 26:01)
not perfect it's fine the number the (25:59 - 26:04)
other thing we got all the time was like (26:01 - 26:06)
the Market's not going to (26:04 - 26:09)
crash H like (26:06 - 26:12)
how if your most expensive card of the (26:09 - 26:15)
year is (26:12 - 26:19)
$146 it was it was a literally a $500 (26:15 - 26:21)
card for like three hours before it (26:19 - 26:24)
dropped to 300 and then like three hours (26:21 - 26:27)
later it dropped to like 200 (26:24 - 26:29)
like (26:27 - 26:31)
and the the reason is not specifically (26:29 - 26:33)
because (26:31 - 26:36)
of like Pokemon itself like I don't (26:33 - 26:38)
think like scarlet and violet cards are (26:36 - 26:41)
suddenly bad or or or like not fun to (26:38 - 26:44)
collect anymore it's just when you have (26:41 - 26:46)
the entire world inside their houses (26:44 - 26:49)
because of a global pandemic and they (26:46 - 26:51)
can't go to bars and they can't go to (26:49 - 26:52)
baseball games and they can't go to (26:51 - 26:54)
concerts and they can't travel to (26:52 - 26:57)
Florida or Japan or Disney or they have (26:54 - 26:58)
extra money (26:57 - 27:00)
mhm and they were like I don't know what (26:58 - 27:02)
to do let's order some Pok√©mon cards and (27:00 - 27:04)
open them let's start collecting (27:02 - 27:06)
something let's get into a new hobby (27:04 - 27:08)
which is great let's make sourdough (27:06 - 27:11)
bread yeah like it like so many people (27:08 - 27:13)
started forming Hobbies like my my (27:11 - 27:16)
personal alltime high on Twitch was at (27:13 - 27:18)
the start of the pandemic did I suddenly (27:16 - 27:21)
become more entertaining no it's just (27:18 - 27:23)
people were at home and they were like I (27:21 - 27:25)

new hobbies and you know what happened (27:30 - 27:34)

soon as people were able to go to (27:34 - 27:40)
California go to Brazil go to Japan go (27:37 - 27:41)

cards I will take having spent an (28:12 - 28:19)
unfortunate amount of time in dork (28:16 - 28:21)
County with nothing to do because (28:19 - 28:23)
there's a giant Lake but your (28:21 - 28:26)
father-in-law is motion sick so he can (28:23 - 28:28)

them brought one weekend and I took the (28:41 - 28:47)
bike and disappeared and I got a message (28:45 - 28:49)
from my husband that just said I hate (28:47 - 28:53)
you so much right now and I said I'm not (28:49 - 28:56)
telling you where I am I'll be back in a (28:53 - 28:59)
couple hours (28:56 - 28:59)
not not a lot of Heavy Hitters on this (29:06 - 29:10)
list but hey if you're in the market for (29:07 - 29:14)
gray felt hat Pikachu it's under $150 50 (29:10 - 29:15)
bucks now hey you know what the number (29:14 - 29:18)

dollars yep that's a lot of gray Feld (29:29 - 29:36)
hat Pikachus yeah it is actually the one (29:32 - 29:37)
that shocked me (29:36 - 29:39)
is the 30th Anniversary which is the (29:37 - 29:41)
dumbest thing they've ever (29:39 - 29:47)
done one card in there is (29:41 - 29:47)
$41,000 and it's not legal to (29:48 - 29:52)
use well I mean this $19 Charizard is (29:53 - 29:59)
technically not illegal card to use you (29:56 - 30:02)
can't you can't actually use (29:59 - 30:02)
it not that anyone's really using (30:03 - 30:07)
Char is that is that is that ungraded (30:11 - 30:16)
was the PSA 10 what's the PSA no it's (30:14 - 30:18)
ungraded it it is just it's in the 30 it (30:16 - 30:22)
was the 30th Anniversary nightmare pack (30:18 - 30:25)
you can't use it in any format leg you (30:22 - 30:27)
can use it with your friends but you (30:25 - 30:29)
can't use it anywhere else uh another (30:27 - 30:33)
card from that set is (30:29 - 30:33)
$20,000 for the record I have nothing (30:34 - 30:39)
against PSA or or Becket (30:36 - 30:44)
or the 900 other grading companies that (30:39 - 30:46)
popped up during the (30:44 - 30:49)
pandemic uh I'm I'm not into like super (30:46 - 30:51)
graded cards but I think I think the (30:49 - 30:55)
only way I think if I was to get like (30:51 - 30:57)
start collecting grading I would be like (30:55 - 30:59)
I want every karant card graded like it (30:57 - 31:00)
would be a very specific thing it (30:59 - 31:02)
wouldn't be like I want every graded (31:00 - 31:04)
card for the sake of getting gr like (31:02 - 31:06)
graded it would be like uh like I have (31:04 - 31:09)
the Japanese karant card promo from like (31:06 - 31:11)
their post office thing that they did (31:09 - 31:14)
that's a weird sentence if like no one's (31:11 - 31:16)
following cards they're like what did (31:14 - 31:20)
you just say a a Japanese karant promo (31:16 - 31:23)
card that was given out during the a (31:20 - 31:26)
post office offer in Japan it was part (31:23 - 31:28)
of their stamp collection (31:26 - 31:29)
and that's the really beautiful one that (31:28 - 31:31)
looks like traditional art style right (31:29 - 31:35)
yes so I have two of those and I don't (31:31 - 31:36)
know if my eyes are good enough to be (31:35 - 31:39)
like this one is maybe a PSA 10 but I (31:36 - 31:41)
would like to get that graded not with (31:39 - 31:43)
the like intent of like oh if it's PSA (31:41 - 31:45)
10 I can resell it I would like to get (31:43 - 31:46)
it graded because (31:45 - 31:50)
like now it is at least protected I'm (31:46 - 31:51)
sure I'm sure I could get like a hard (31:50 - 31:53)
case or whatever but you know how like (31:51 - 31:55)
like they airtight it and they like yeah (31:53 - 31:57)
like it's mostly the protection aspect (31:55 - 31:59)
of like I don't care if it's like an an (31:57 - 32:01)
eight or a nine or a 10 it's like okay (31:59 - 32:02)
now it's like (32:01 - 32:06)
permanently safe I guess for however (32:02 - 32:08)
much PSA charges I think it's like 30 (32:06 - 32:09)
bucks or something a (32:08 - 32:11)
card I don't know I don't know if they (32:09 - 32:13)
still have like a six-month weight I (32:11 - 32:15)
don't think so anymore I think they've I (32:13 - 32:17)
don't think so I think it's got back to (32:15 - 32:21)
normal yeah okay so uh let's take a (32:17 - 32:23)
break when we get back we'll just (32:21 - 32:24)
quickly go over the top 10 most searched (32:23 - 32:26)
for cards in Japan which is very (32:24 - 32:29)
different than this list list of top 10 (32:26 - 32:31)
expensive cards and then we have a (32:29 - 32:32)
couple more news things and then we'll (32:31 - 32:34)
wrap up for the week so we will be right (32:32 - 32:38)
back and we are back from our break all (32:34 - 32:41)
right let's uh go over the top 10 most (32:38 - 32:45)
search for cards in Japan this is (32:41 - 32:49)
specifically off Pokemon card.com which (32:45 - 32:53)
is the actual Japanese official Pokemon (32:49 - 32:55)
TCG (32:53 - 32:59)
website Pokemon Hy (32:55 - 33:01)
card.com uh they (32:59 - 33:06)
did top 100 or no sorry they did top 50 (33:01 - 33:08)
uh but we'll just do the top 10 uh (33:06 - 33:12)
number 10 is squab Billy (33:08 - 33:14)
ex uh (33:12 - 33:18)
which I I think I think a few decks run (33:14 - 33:21)
squack ability squack abil squack abil (33:18 - 33:24)
squack abilly because of its (33:21 - 33:28)
ability squa ability It's squa ability (33:24 - 33:30)
it's like West anality but for the (33:28 - 33:32)
Modern (33:30 - 33:32)
Age and then we have uh gutina (33:33 - 33:39)
V oh this is like weird because they (33:37 - 33:41)
they come from different sets so like (33:39 - 33:43)
squack abilly comes from snow Hazard (33:41 - 33:45)
which I don't know what set that got (33:43 - 33:48)
moved into in the United States um (33:45 - 33:53)
gutina varar uh which is a a gutina card (33:48 - 33:55)
that was used in Lost Zone decks and (33:53 - 34:00)
then we have number eight is (33:55 - 34:03)
CLIA just just just a (34:00 - 34:05)
CUA it'll make more sense when we go up (34:03 - 34:07)
the (34:05 - 34:11)
list number seven is Sab ey which is (34:07 - 34:14)
another lost Zone card the art on that (34:11 - 34:17)
one is so (34:14 - 34:20)
good uh and then number six is Spirit (34:17 - 34:22)
tomb uh which I believe some people are (34:20 - 34:24)
playing in their deck usually one Spirit (34:22 - 34:25)
tomb because of its (34:24 - 34:30)
ability uh then number five is chenow (34:25 - 34:35)
ex uh which has also its ability I think (34:30 - 34:37)
I I can't remember what people were (34:35 - 34:38)
pairing with (34:37 - 34:41)
chenow um well I think they're pairing (34:38 - 34:43)
Greninja because they're both water (34:41 - 34:45)
Pokemon in this game so uh that would be (34:43 - 34:48)
radiant (34:45 - 34:50)
Greninja is number (34:48 - 34:52)
four and then the top three shouldn't (34:50 - 34:53)
surprise anyone but number three is (34:52 - 34:54)
going to be (34:53 - 34:59)
me which can copy other people's moves (34:54 - 35:01)
and do it that's usually the gimmick (34:59 - 35:03)
with meu uh and then number two is (35:01 - 35:06)
maridon ex which one of the most popular (35:03 - 35:10)
decks is maridon maridon decks and then (35:06 - 35:14)
number one is gavor ex which again (35:10 - 35:17)
another deck so these were the most (35:14 - 35:22)
searched for cards in Japan in (35:17 - 35:29)
2023 notice how they're all competitive (35:22 - 35:29)
if there's a Charizard Charizard did (35:29 - 35:34)
make it in the list in number 20 it was (35:32 - 35:35)
the (35:34 - 35:41)
151 uh promo Charizard at number 20 but (35:35 - 35:44)
yeah just uh just look if you're it's (35:41 - 35:46)
very easy in Japan if you want to play (35:44 - 35:48)
the (35:46 - 35:52)
TCG they they it's very (35:48 - 35:56)
easy you can jump on a bus or a train or (35:52 - 35:57)
probably walk down the street because (35:56 - 36:00)
there's probably a tournament or a local (35:57 - 36:03)
league in America you might not have (36:00 - 36:06)
that luxury you might might might be (36:03 - 36:08)
like a 45 minute car ride to get to your (36:06 - 36:11)
nearest (36:08 - 36:11)
tournament (36:12 - 36:16)
um I don't know what this curly does I (36:14 - 36:18)
don't have the English version of it but (36:16 - 36:21)
in front of me (36:18 - 36:21)
but um okay what's next on the new list (36:23 - 36:29)
here oh we'll switch over to some (36:27 - 36:32)
Pokemon scarlet and violet (36:29 - 36:36)
news some not really breaking news just (36:32 - 36:39)
you know some some some Pokemon scarlet (36:36 - 36:42)
and violet bugs yeah or are they (36:39 - 36:44)
oversights are they bugs or are they (36:42 - 36:47)
oversights (36:44 - 36:47)
features okay so there's a known they (36:50 - 36:54)
they the Pokemon company is calling a (36:52 - 36:57)
bug for the record known bug when when a (36:54 - 37:00)
Pokemon under the effect of dragon cheer (36:57 - 37:02)
is switched out in battle and then (37:00 - 37:06)
reenters the its attack stats will still (37:02 - 37:08)
have the heightened chance of Landing a (37:06 - 37:10)
critical hit this intended behavior for (37:08 - 37:13)
Dragon cheers effects to be removed the (37:10 - 37:16)
intended behavior is for Dragon cheers (37:13 - 37:17)
effects to be removed when a Pokemon (37:16 - 37:19)
switches out of battle we plan to fix (37:17 - 37:21)
this issue in (37:19 - 37:25)
3.0.1 which will be released mid January (37:21 - 37:27)
2024 or later (37:25 - 37:33)
um Dragon Shear will be usable in uh (37:27 - 37:35)
dragon (37:33 - 37:35)
Shar if you're doing ranked battles (37:36 - 37:42)
right now you can still use Dragon cheer (37:39 - 37:43)
there's nothing preventing you from (37:42 - 37:46)
doing that and if you want to cheese the (37:43 - 37:49)
ladder by all means you have probably a (37:46 - 37:52)
week or so to do (37:49 - 37:55)
that (37:52 - 37:58)
uh and (37:55 - 38:02)
technically you it it is usable (37:58 - 38:05)
regardless but uh they did come out and (38:02 - 38:08)
say that at the upcoming regionals (38:05 - 38:12)
Dragon cheer will be (38:08 - 38:12)
banned uh but apparently because the (38:13 - 38:17)
blueberry prologue which we talked about (38:15 - 38:20)
last week is taking place next week and (38:17 - 38:23)
because they are not Banning it on rank (38:20 - 38:24)
ladder because I don't know how they (38:23 - 38:27)
would without pushing an update which (38:24 - 38:28)
which they already said they're not (38:27 - 38:31)
doing until 3.0.1 is ready for the (38:28 - 38:34)
blueberry prologue not to be confused (38:31 - 38:36)
with the (38:34 - 38:36)
epilogue you can use Dragon chear so (38:37 - 38:45)
uh I don't (38:42 - 38:47)
know they acknowledge that it's there (38:45 - 38:49)
they acknowledge that it's a problem and (38:47 - 38:52)
they can't or slash aren't doing (38:49 - 38:56)
anything about it yet why don't they (38:52 - 38:58)
just (38:56 - 39:00)
delay the blueberry prologue just push (38:58 - 39:03)
it back a week or (39:00 - 39:05)
two like I don't think this is like the (39:03 - 39:08)
end of the (39:05 - 39:12)
world cuz not a lot of Pokemon can learn (39:08 - 39:14)
Dragon (39:12 - 39:14)
cheer but it it's still (39:15 - 39:22)
[Laughter] (39:19 - 39:25)
annoying (39:22 - 39:25)
um (39:25 - 39:28)
you know I could understand if this was (39:29 - 39:33)
an oversight I I would let it slide but (39:30 - 39:36)
since they're clarifying it as a bug un (39:33 - 39:38)
unacceptable (39:36 - 39:41)
honestly how dare they how dare what (39:38 - 39:44)
what else is supposed to be fit fix with (39:41 - 39:48)
3.0.1 the TM for uh metal metal sound I (39:44 - 39:51)
think yeah whatever the one (39:48 - 39:55)
that had Scarlet doesn't get Scarlet (39:51 - 39:59)
yeah um metal sound Dragon shear and (39:55 - 40:03)
what was the last one oh in oh yeah yeah (39:59 - 40:07)
they got ink got to make it so ink isn't (40:03 - 40:10)
breaking people's (40:07 - 40:10)
game man what a (40:10 - 40:14)
treat you know I think I will take these (40:14 - 40:19)
issues over just (40:16 - 40:22)
playing like heartold soul silver (40:19 - 40:24)
diamond and pearl I watched somebody (40:22 - 40:27)
knock out a level 100 Pokemon (40:24 - 40:29)
and it was like three to five business (40:27 - 40:30)
days before that Pokemon got like (40:29 - 40:33)
knocked out fully it was just I thought (40:30 - 40:38)
I was watching paint dry I like a (40:33 - 40:38)
nightmare I will also say the ink issue (40:39 - 40:45)
is a lot less stressful than the who (40:43 - 40:47)
knows why people's games were getting (40:45 - 40:51)
bricked issue early on in this game's (40:47 - 40:54)
existence I sure like knowing that the (40:51 - 40:58)
issue is with an underleveled in (40:54 - 40:58)
actually knowing what I can do to avoid (40:59 - 41:05)
it instead of just maybe it has to do (41:01 - 41:06)
with Pokemon (41:05 - 41:08)
go (41:06 - 41:11)
maybe maybe it's vivon maybe it's gimy (41:08 - 41:15)
ghoul maybe it's updating I think what (41:11 - 41:16)
some people thought it was like (41:15 - 41:18)
purchasing the (41:16 - 41:18)
DLC uh so there's your T tune in next (41:19 - 41:25)
week where we talk about what else is (41:23 - 41:28)
broken with scarlet and (41:25 - 41:30)
the whole epilog we we'll see we're not (41:28 - 41:34)
talking about it next week but (41:30 - 41:37)
um uh I think it's been long enough our (41:34 - 41:40)
our like two podcast rule here we said (41:37 - 41:42)
Pokemon coners came out you should watch (41:40 - 41:44)
it I think both of you watched it I (41:42 - 41:46)
finally watched (41:44 - 41:48)
it (41:46 - 41:53)
uh you y all overhyped it what it's (41:48 - 41:57)
a here here's here's how how dare dare (41:53 - 42:00)
you here's how I would review it if (41:57 - 42:01)
somebody didn't have Netflix and was (42:00 - 42:04)
like should I get Pokemon concierge (42:01 - 42:06)
should I spend the $22 for Netflix (42:04 - 42:09)
premium or whatever it is I would say no (42:06 - 42:10)
it's not worth (42:09 - 42:13)
$22 if it was on Netflix or if sorry if (42:10 - 42:15)
it was on YouTube for free I would say (42:13 - 42:17)
yeah you should watch it because you're (42:15 - 42:19)
it's like an hour and it's cute I just (42:17 - 42:22)
have you watched hu and snow yet no but (42:19 - 42:25)
I I may but if it's better it might be (42:22 - 42:27)
better than Kier (42:25 - 42:31)
uh I think it is I thought concierge was (42:27 - 42:33)
enjoyable but it (42:31 - 42:35)
wasn't (42:33 - 42:39)
amazing it was very cute and sweet and (42:35 - 42:43)
fun I think and I wanted to live there (42:39 - 42:45)
here's the best part about concierge the (42:43 - 42:49)
The Magikarp That Couldn't swim he was (42:45 - 42:51)
by far the best part of that whole (42:49 - 42:55)
series all of it was great all of it was (42:51 - 42:57)
good all of it was really good all of (42:55 - 42:59)
the sounds all of the music all of the (42:57 - 43:00)
little sounds that the Pokemon made like (42:59 - 43:03)
when the Psyduck was just bouncing along (43:00 - 43:05)
in the in the scooter that they were (43:03 - 43:07)
riding in all of it was fantastic and (43:05 - 43:11)
adorable but also it was they're just no (43:07 - 43:13)
I didn't like the Scooby-Doo Shaggy guy (43:11 - 43:16)
I just didn't Vibe with Vibe with him at (43:13 - 43:19)
all he gave me big he gave me big Shaggy (43:16 - 43:22)
energy you don't think so like yeah (43:19 - 43:27)
tuper man no here's the thing what they (43:22 - 43:30)
did with textures alone in that series (43:27 - 43:33)
is amazing oh no it's gorgeous it's very (43:30 - 43:34)
it's very (43:33 - 43:39)
pretty from a pure art of what they made (43:34 - 43:42)
in there with all the texture stuff (43:39 - 43:45)
it puts a lot of things to shame the (43:42 - 43:48)
amount of care and detail work that they (43:45 - 43:51)
put in there the the amount of attention (43:48 - 43:54)
they PID to each Pokemon and the texture (43:51 - 43:55)
of what that Pokemon should look like (43:54 - 43:58)
and how it reflects in the world it's (43:55 - 44:02)
brilliant is it a very simple story (43:58 - 44:05)
absolutely but it's that isn't that (44:02 - 44:07)
isn't I don't feel like that's the point (44:05 - 44:10)
the point is to exist in an incredibly (44:07 - 44:12)
beautiful relaxing world where you are (44:10 - 44:14)
trying to just be like the main (44:12 - 44:16)
character is and let go of a lot of the (44:14 - 44:18)
other things and on that level it is (44:16 - 44:20)
incredibly (44:18 - 44:23)
successful yes artwise especially it's a (44:20 - 44:26)
fantastic piece of work story-wise it's (44:23 - 44:28)
not going to blow you away and I was a (44:26 - 44:30)
little worried about the Pikachu in that (44:28 - 44:33)
last episode (44:30 - 44:37)
but but it's still the right amount of (44:33 - 44:40)
stress it wasn't it wasn't stress it's (44:37 - 44:41)
just that's not how I would have dealt (44:40 - 44:43)
with I'm an introvert that's not how I (44:41 - 44:46)
would try to get another introvert to (44:43 - 44:47)
feel (44:46 - 44:50)
better introverted Pikachu I just think (44:47 - 44:52)
of like path to the peak which I did (44:50 - 44:55)
watch right path to the peak his suing (44:52 - 44:59)
snow pal and wins concierge I could (44:55 - 45:02)
probably name like 18 other YouTube four (44:59 - 45:04)
episode things they love four episodes (45:02 - 45:06)
that's like they're they're crazy that's (45:04 - 45:08)
why I haven't watched the sweet and snow (45:06 - 45:10)
only three not (45:08 - 45:13)
four um I just think of all these shows (45:10 - 45:15)
right (45:13 - 45:18)
and Netflix decided concierge was the (45:15 - 45:21)
one they wanted to pay for or whatever (45:18 - 45:22)
right there's a brand deal that was (45:21 - 45:24)
struck that's why concierge is behind (45:22 - 45:28)
the pay wall and Netflix's whole (45:24 - 45:31)
business model is not to like keep a (45:28 - 45:34)
show running for eight eight seasons (45:31 - 45:35)
because they know that doesn't work what (45:34 - 45:38)
works is a new show with a new season to (45:35 - 45:40)
get you to sign up that's why that's not (45:38 - 45:42)
the reason they don't run new shows it's (45:40 - 45:44)
because once you go through past three (45:42 - 45:46)
seasons they have to pay people more I (45:44 - 45:48)
believe yep (45:46 - 45:51)
100% yeah but also if like if I'm saying (45:48 - 45:53)
like season five of something is coming (45:51 - 45:57)
out that's not as exciting to say (45:53 - 46:00)
a brand new show and a brand new season (45:57 - 46:01)
is coming out depends on how much hype (46:00 - 46:03)
the series generates you can always get (46:01 - 46:06)
new viewers like we we we we can point (46:03 - 46:09)
to the parts that break that rule which (46:06 - 46:10)
is like stranger things which is going (46:09 - 46:12)
on season five and people are chomping (46:10 - 46:16)
at the bit for it to get done it it it (46:12 - 46:19)
really depends on how much they invest (46:16 - 46:21)
into that series and what's going on (46:19 - 46:23)
like I don't know that's Universal it is (46:21 - 46:26)
true that Netflix does not like paying (46:23 - 46:29)
money for things so even shows and (46:26 - 46:30)
series that are incredibly popular that (46:29 - 46:33)
has an incredibly strong fan base will (46:30 - 46:35)
get cancelled because they don't want to (46:33 - 46:38)
pay more money and it's less to do with (46:35 - 46:41)
hype it's also (46:38 - 46:41)
harder to sell new ideas that aren't (46:41 - 46:48)
based on something that exists right so (46:45 - 46:50)
like one piece liveaction was a huge (46:48 - 46:51)
seller because everybody knows what one (46:50 - 46:53)
piece is and it's promised to be a lot (46:51 - 46:56)
shorter than one piece so and it was so (46:53 - 46:59)
successful that they're redoing the (46:56 - 47:03)
anime they're coming out with one piece (46:59 - 47:06)
again in anime (47:03 - 47:09)
form so (47:06 - 47:12)
like Netflix just has a Netflix has a (47:09 - 47:15)
really bad model where where their (47:12 - 47:17)
biggest driver is how much do they have (47:15 - 47:21)
to pay people and the reality is is you (47:17 - 47:23)
particularly for animated you have to (47:21 - 47:26)
pay voice actors less money than you do (47:23 - 47:29)
actors who are on screen so anything (47:26 - 47:31)
where they can keep getting layers away (47:29 - 47:33)
from having real people on screen is (47:31 - 47:35)
always gon to be cheaper for (47:33 - 47:38)
them I believe someone in slack pointed (47:35 - 47:40)
out that there was also the studio that (47:38 - 47:42)
did the animation was the same Studio (47:40 - 47:44)
that did the (47:42 - 47:47)
rakuma animation on Netflix so that was (47:44 - 47:48)
already a studio that had worked and (47:47 - 47:51)
made a Netflix show so that's probably (47:48 - 47:53)
another reason why concierge is on there (47:51 - 47:58)
instead of being on YouTube for first (47:53 - 47:58)
yeah I (48:00 - 48:02)
mean I again I don't I don't think if if (48:04 - 48:09)
you're on the fence of like I want to (48:07 - 48:11)
watch concierge and I don't have Netflix (48:09 - 48:14)
I I I don't think it's worth $22 I think (48:11 - 48:16)
if it seems like it's your kind of show (48:14 - 48:18)
then you're probably right if you're a (48:16 - 48:21)
little unsure about it then maybe it's (48:18 - 48:23)
not worth $22 for a month of Netflix but (48:21 - 48:25)
if it seems like the kind of show you (48:23 - 48:27)
would enjoy if you just want a chill (48:25 - 48:30)
Pokemon piece of artwork to watch for an (48:27 - 48:33)
hour it is really good in those (48:30 - 48:36)
aspects yeah I mean to to be fair (48:33 - 48:38)
nothing is worth the $22 that you're (48:36 - 48:40)
paying a month for Netflix I don't think (48:38 - 48:43)
that's true there's no one thing that I (48:40 - 48:45)
can look at I think one piece is a (48:43 - 48:47)
million perc worth $22 like if you just (48:45 - 48:49)
got Netflix for a single month just to (48:47 - 48:51)
watch One Piece like I think that is (48:49 - 48:53)
worth like what what is a movie at a (48:51 - 48:56)
movie theater like $15 for 90 minutes a (48:53 - 48:58)
two hours one piece is eight hours like (48:56 - 49:02)
it's a like one piece was 100% worth (48:58 - 49:05)
$22 I would even like I'm not even a big (49:02 - 49:06)
stranger things fan but (49:05 - 49:09)
like if you've never watched stranger (49:06 - 49:11)
things to watch the first four seasons (49:09 - 49:14)
for $22 like that's worth (49:11 - 49:16)
it I don't know strange things kind of (49:14 - 49:19)
started falling apart for me but it's (49:16 - 49:20)
like that sun cost fallacy of like (49:19 - 49:22)
there's supposed to be one season left (49:20 - 49:25)
so might as well finish (49:22 - 49:28)
it (49:25 - 49:28)
I think the Scott Pilgrim thing is worth (49:30 - 49:33)
$22 but I'm also a Scott Pilgrim fan so (49:35 - 49:40)
I mean I'm a I'm a big Scott Pilgrim fan (49:38 - 49:42)
I don't know that is worth $22 but like (49:40 - 49:45)
all of those things together (49:42 - 49:49)
absolutely are worth $22 like but that (49:45 - 49:50)
but I talked about this last week where (49:49 - 49:53)
my my strategy is buy it for a month (49:50 - 49:58)
watch everything and then cancel (49:53 - 49:58)
because I think I I like going back to (49:59 - 50:04)
like the new signups like there's (50:01 - 50:05)
there's plenty of articles that talk (50:04 - 50:07)
about how Netflix prioritizes new (50:05 - 50:08)
signups they don't care about (50:07 - 50:10)
reoccurring Seasons they only care about (50:08 - 50:13)
getting new people to sign up and and (50:10 - 50:15)
announcing new shows like one piece or (50:13 - 50:19)
Scott Pilgrim or whatever is way more (50:15 - 50:20)
successful than being like we're on (50:19 - 50:24)
season 19 of this show um even though (50:20 - 50:26)
like there might be like this rabid fan (50:24 - 50:28)
base for season 19 of (50:26 - 50:32)
whatever uh but I (50:28 - 50:34)
like you get somebody to sign up and (50:32 - 50:37)
then they they forget to cancel or they (50:34 - 50:39)
have Auto Renew on and all of a sudden (50:37 - 50:41)
they're you're just making money and (50:39 - 50:43)
then you get them in the the instance of (50:41 - 50:44)
like well I'm scared to cancel because (50:43 - 50:46)
if I try to reson up in two months (50:44 - 50:47)
you're going to raise the prices on me (50:46 - 50:50)
and I'm like locked in for at least (50:47 - 50:52)
whatever weird grace period they give (50:50 - 50:53)
which is only like three months normally (50:52 - 50:55)
of like we keep your price for three (50:53 - 50:58)
months before we increase (50:55 - 50:58)
it I guess also somebody's going to be (50:58 - 51:02)
like well you could do the ad yeah I (51:00 - 51:03)
guess technically you could do like the (51:02 - 51:06)
ad version for cheaper than 22 but 22 is (51:03 - 51:10)
like the standard like 4K (51:06 - 51:12)
whatever CU I don't even think I think (51:10 - 51:15)
like the 799 isn't even HD I think it's (51:12 - 51:18)
like 480p or (51:15 - 51:21)
something still get to watch the things (51:18 - 51:23)
and I'm sure they'll bring ads to the 4K (51:21 - 51:25)
one eventually you don't want to watch (51:23 - 51:28)
Pok on coner in 480p you would be doing (51:25 - 51:31)
yourself a (51:28 - 51:31)
disservice I thought it was okay (51:33 - 51:39)
though uh okay uh last bit of news here (51:36 - 51:43)
is uh the Pokemon Go stuff uh we'll (51:39 - 51:46)
start with the (51:43 - 51:50)
fendy uh which is fendy fragment and (51:46 - 51:52)
Pokemon have teamed up together to (51:50 - 51:57)
release a dragon knight collection (51:52 - 51:59)
if you don't know what Fendi is they're (51:57 - 52:05)
a designer brand like Gucci or Prada or (51:59 - 52:07)
Balenciaga none of the for the record (52:05 - 52:09)
none of these companies are good just (52:07 - 52:11)
because we're reporting on Fendi does (52:09 - 52:14)
not mean we support fendy or Balenciaga (52:11 - 52:16)
or any of these or just reporting the (52:14 - 52:21)
news here or Netflix (52:16 - 52:21)
or also not a great company um so (52:21 - 52:28)
segment (52:26 - 52:30)
uh they do their own thing fendy does (52:28 - 52:32)
their own thing Pokemon does their own (52:30 - 52:34)
thing the news out of this is they came (52:32 - 52:37)
together and there is a free Dragonite (52:34 - 52:40)
hoodie in Pokemon go that you can get it (52:37 - 52:44)
does say fendy on it so you want to wear (52:40 - 52:47)
that you know be your own person uh but (52:44 - 52:48)
there is also like a hat that you can (52:47 - 52:50)
get but you only get the Hat by going to (52:48 - 52:52)
a fendy (52:50 - 52:56)
location uh which I think there are some (52:52 - 52:57)
Standalone stores I think there's one in (52:56 - 52:59)
New York I think there's one in Chicago (52:57 - 53:02)
and then they're also like part of Sachs (52:59 - 53:05)
Avenue so I believe those should count (53:02 - 53:09)
from what Pokemon Go's website said that (53:05 - 53:10)
should be available for about a full (53:09 - 53:12)
year so there shouldn't be a rush if (53:10 - 53:15)
you're looking for the Hat um now if (53:12 - 53:17)
you're actually looking to buy things (53:15 - 53:22)
with money to put on your IRL person (53:17 - 53:25)
yourself the hoodie you get in game is (53:22 - 53:29)
free the hoodie in real life (53:25 - 53:33)
$1,200 a (53:29 - 53:33)
bargain that cute Dratini purse you're (53:33 - 53:37)
seeing (53:35 - 53:40)

$2,550 you want a bracelet with a (53:41 - 53:47)
Pokeball that opens up and has the (53:45 - 53:48)
fragment (53:47 - 53:50)
logo (53:48 - 53:54)
$520 and the actual cute draini purse is (53:50 - 53:56)
almost $3,000 (53:54 - 53:58)
because there there's atini and (53:56 - 53:59)
Dragonite purses that actually are some (53:58 - 54:01)
of the best Pokemon merch I think that (53:59 - 54:03)
they have released in a collaboration in (54:01 - 54:06)
sometime these actually look cool it's (54:03 - 54:08)
not just Pokemon slapped on a thing the (54:06 - 54:11)
purses actually look like the (54:08 - 54:13)
Pokemon (54:11 - 54:16)
$2,950 which I I'm not surprised by it's (54:13 - 54:19)
a (54:16 - 54:19)
bargain (54:20 - 54:24)
um yeah (54:21 - 54:27)
uh if you're going to ask the question (54:24 - 54:28)
who is buying (54:27 - 54:30)
this not (54:28 - 54:34)
[Laughter] (54:30 - 54:34)
you rich people they they're not buying (54:35 - 54:42)
like $20 t-shirts at Target well maybe (54:38 - 54:46)
some of them are uh $850 t-shirt is is (54:42 - 54:49)
nothing to somebody worth (54:46 - 54:52)
millions of dollars this is this is (54:49 - 54:55)
just an a walk in the park for them to (54:52 - 54:58)

up if you've never heard of fendy now (55:10 - 55:17)
you have so the mission accomplished you (55:13 - 55:20)
now know what fendy is I will say like (55:17 - 55:21)
we've covered a lot of designer brands (55:20 - 55:23)
in like the last two years or (55:21 - 55:27)
whatever uh the last one we covered was (55:23 - 55:30)
APC which not as luxury still luxury but (55:27 - 55:32)
not as luxury as (55:30 - 55:35)
fendy uh this is a way better (55:32 - 55:36)
collaboration also a way more expensive (55:35 - 55:40)
collaboration but way better um Tiffany (55:36 - 55:43)
and Company probably on the (55:40 - 55:46)
same par but that was mostly just (55:43 - 55:49)
necklace and bracelet this is Hoodie (55:46 - 55:54)
hat um credit card holder purse lots of (55:49 - 55:57)
purses uh actually (55:54 - 56:00)
but so anyways I guess the news here is (55:57 - 56:02)
get your free Dragonite hoodie you have (56:00 - 56:05)
like a year to do so if you are in a (56:02 - 56:07)
location of a fendy store one I don't (56:05 - 56:08)
know if they'll let you in because a lot (56:07 - 56:10)
of these designer stores now are (56:08 - 56:11)
appointment only but if you get close (56:10 - 56:13)
enough there should be a pok√© stop yeah (56:11 - 56:15)
it's location based you don't have to (56:13 - 56:17)
actually go inside though it does look (56:15 - 56:20)

the uh promo code is available until (57:03 - 57:10)
January 4th 2025 so we're good there um (57:05 - 57:13)
so we we had a segment last week about (57:10 - 57:17)
Pokemon go that I ended up cutting um (57:13 - 57:19)
because the I wanted the show to be the (57:17 - 57:21)
show was already running La decided to (57:19 - 57:23)
cut it mostly because this news came out (57:21 - 57:27)
and I thought that this was (57:23 - 57:27)
I didn't want to have the same (57:27 - 57:30)
conversation twice especially now that (57:28 - 57:32)
we have like the top 10 moments of 2023 (57:30 - 57:34)
so like what happened in Pokemon go in (57:32 - 57:37)
2023 Hannah asked a really good question (57:34 - 57:39)
last week that I haven't been that I've (57:37 - 57:40)
been thinking about the entire time so (57:39 - 57:42)
what we ended up cutting was Hannah (57:40 - 57:45)
saying it wasn't bad (57:42 - 57:48)
by Hannah said what is bringing you back (57:45 - 57:51)
to Pokemon go that isn't like events and (57:48 - 57:53)
that isn't new Pokemon and I had to (57:51 - 57:55)
think about it and for me I did I I (57:53 - 57:57)
thought about it obviously for me it's a (57:55 - 58:00)
couple things number one it's like let's (57:57 - 58:02)
say I don't go to any Pokemon go event (58:00 - 58:04)
and let's say they don't release any new (58:02 - 58:06)
Pokemon even though to me like new (58:04 - 58:07)
Pokemon don't really drive me because (58:06 - 58:10)
like sattle was the newest one and it (58:07 - 58:12)
was like H who cares sattle I'll care (58:10 - 58:15)
when it they bring it as shiny then I'll (58:12 - 58:16)
care um but here's the three things that (58:15 - 58:18)
bring me back to Pokemon go regardless (58:16 - 58:21)
of what Niantic does or whatever number (58:18 - 58:24)
one is getting to level 50 I'm almost (58:21 - 58:27)
there I'm level 49 I need to like do 500 (58:24 - 58:29)
more Excellence I need to do the go (58:27 - 58:31)
battle League stuff which I'm actually (58:29 - 58:34)
like I'm I've been anytime I see like a (58:31 - 58:35)
team on Twitter I've been hitting the (58:34 - 58:37)
little save button to be like oh I could (58:35 - 58:39)
probably build this team so I have to do (58:37 - 58:40)
go battle league and I have to get to (58:39 - 58:42)
level 50 that's my goal for this year (58:40 - 58:46)
number two is to continue my lucky decks (58:42 - 58:48)
I really really like lucky Pokemon and I (58:46 - 58:49)
think the thing I mentioned last week (58:48 - 58:51)
with Hannah was like oh like I'm really (58:49 - 58:53)
excited for like a lucky event if they (58:51 - 58:54)
do that CU I've been trying to do my (58:53 - 59:00)
lucky decks and number three is uh my (58:54 - 59:02)
shiny decks I need one more Pokemon in (59:00 - 59:05)
Kanto which is goldine I still don't (59:02 - 59:07)
have a goldine and then I have all (59:05 - 59:10)
151 Kanto Pokemon I need four more (59:07 - 59:13)
Pokemon for Johto they're all baby (59:10 - 59:15)
Pokemon like Clea (59:13 - 59:17)
and they've got you trapped with the (59:15 - 59:20)
incubators yeah yeah (59:17 - 59:21)
yeah (59:20 - 59:24)
and and then I need like a I need like (59:21 - 59:26)
four or five Pokemon for hoen I really (59:24 - 59:28)
haven't looked past that I'll evaluate (59:26 - 59:32)
CNO once c tour comes but (59:28 - 59:34)
like for me it's it's just like creating (59:32 - 59:36)
my own goals and I know that those three (59:34 - 59:38)
things alone I probably won't get done (59:36 - 59:40)
this year well I think level 50 will (59:38 - 59:43)
happen but like I don't know I like I I (59:40 - 59:45)
I like the big and small a lot as well (59:43 - 59:48)
so like trading for big and small (59:45 - 59:50)
shinies or trying to get a big or small (59:48 - 59:52)
shiny like is is really compelling to me (59:50 - 59:55)
when an event comes out and (59:52 - 59:58)
I like showcases a lot and I think (59:55 - 59:59)
showcases are pretty (59:58 - 60:03)
underrated and when it's nice out it's (59:59 - 60:05)
very cold right now but when it's nice (60:03 - 60:07)
out and I'm playing Pokemon Go Active (60:05 - 60:09)
and like the Showcase is like I don't (60:07 - 60:11)
know like mil tank or something like I (60:09 - 60:13)
am now like I need to catch every mil (60:11 - 60:15)
tank as possible this weekend because I (60:13 - 60:17)
want to try to win that showcase and you (60:15 - 60:19)
know that's maybe not appealing to (60:17 - 60:23)
everyone but for me like I absolutely (60:19 - 60:25)
love showcases and I I hope that Niantic (60:23 - 60:27)
makes those slightly better because I (60:25 - 60:28)
think right now showcase only is like (60:27 - 60:30)
the biggest it would be nice to see like (60:28 - 60:33)
the smallest or the the heaviest I don't (60:30 - 60:35)
think they've done that yet I think (60:33 - 60:36)
they've talked about doing that or they (60:35 - 60:38)
were supposed to do the smallest but (60:36 - 60:40)
then it broke so they went back to the (60:38 - 60:42)
heaviest that's very possible I think (60:40 - 60:44)
they might have done that and actually (60:42 - 60:46)
that last thing you mentioned gets close (60:44 - 60:49)
to the actual question I asked which is (60:46 - 60:51)
not what do what brings you back to (60:49 - 60:53)
Pokemon go regardless of what Niantic is (60:51 - 60:56)
doing my question was what is Niantic (60:53 - 60:58)
doing that is bringing you back to (60:56 - 61:02)
Pok√©mon go other than in-person events (60:58 - 61:05)
than the live ticketed location based (61:02 - 61:07)
events what are the things that Niantic (61:05 - 61:09)
is doing that brings you back to Pokemon (61:07 - 61:11)
go what are the things that Niantic is (61:09 - 61:14)
doing that are making people excited (61:11 - 61:16)
about the game because having our own (61:14 - 61:18)
goals and being able to aim for whatever (61:16 - 61:19)
we want is one of the great things about (61:18 - 61:23)
most Pokemon games that's their just (61:19 - 61:25)
that's one of the things that makes it a (61:23 - 61:28)
Pokemon game in my opinion but what (61:25 - 61:32)
Niantic is doing is kind (61:28 - 61:36)
of the way or it's the thing that's (61:32 - 61:39)
keeping the game alive for a lot of (61:36 - 61:41)
people what is ntic doing to bring (61:39 - 61:44)
people back I know that Greg you always (61:41 - 61:46)
talk about Final Fantasy and how that's (61:44 - 61:48)
one of those games that if there's not (61:46 - 61:50)
something you're excited it about you (61:48 - 61:52)
can go off play other things and then (61:50 - 61:54)
they will do something exciting to bring (61:52 - 61:57)
you back Y what is nanic doing that is (61:54 - 62:00)
exciting to bring people back that isn't (61:57 - 62:02)
Live iners (62:00 - 62:05)
Events and showcases it sounds like (62:02 - 62:09)
Steve is one for you well let's before (62:05 - 62:12)
we talk about 2024 let's go over the top (62:09 - 62:16)
10 moments of 2023 the (62:12 - 62:18)
poom no this is actually on Pokemon's (62:16 - 62:21)
websit so probably because Niantic laid (62:18 - 62:22)
off the person who would have written (62:21 - 62:23)
this on their (62:22 - 62:25)
blog (62:23 - 62:26)
Get (62:25 - 62:30)
Wrecked it's true okay so uh top 10 (62:26 - 62:32)
moments they're starting off with Hello (62:30 - 62:36)
hoen uh that was the Pokemon go tour (62:32 - 62:39)
hoen that ran from February 25th to 26 (62:36 - 62:41)
the Ruby and Sapphire badges for Ruby (62:39 - 62:45)
and Sapphire um so hoen (62:41 - 62:49)
tour uh I don't think c tour will be as (62:45 - 62:51)
exciting as ho and tour mostly we've (62:49 - 62:53)
talked about this because CNO relies a (62:51 - 62:56)
lot on gen one nostalgia and hoen tried (62:53 - 62:59)
to hoen just introduced more Pokemon (62:56 - 63:01)
right hoen just had like 132 Pokemon so (62:59 - 63:04)
only had like 80 new Pokemon or (63:01 - 63:05)
something like (63:04 - 63:07)
that (63:05 - 63:12)
um primals was on their top 10 uh so (63:07 - 63:14)
Mega Evolution has been in Pokemon go (63:12 - 63:15)
since (63:14 - 63:19)
2020 which actually crazy uh but 2023 (63:15 - 63:22)
focused on hoen you got Primal Groudon (63:19 - 63:24)
you got Primal Kyogre they I don't think (63:22 - 63:26)
they me mention it here but technically (63:24 - 63:27)
I guess you got mega (63:26 - 63:30)
Rayquaza um which is another Mega but (63:27 - 63:33)
they're all the same it's it's all the (63:30 - 63:34)
it's all the same thing you can I mean (63:33 - 63:37)
yeah you can change the word (63:34 - 63:41)
but it's all the same thing uh Shadow (63:37 - 63:44)
Pokemon are incredibly popular in May uh (63:41 - 63:48)
they took the raid boss uh approach with (63:44 - 63:51)
Shadow raid Pokemon bringing back Mewtwo (63:48 - 63:53)
as one of the Shadow raid bosses these (63:51 - 63:56)
were one three festar Shadow raids can (63:53 - 63:57)
only be challenged in person because (63:56 - 63:59)
Shadow Pokemon are so strong trainers (63:57 - 64:02)
will receive new tools to subdue them (63:59 - 64:03)
purify (64:02 - 64:05)
gems which is a new (64:03 - 64:09)
mechanic uh and (64:05 - 64:12)
then I have my own problem with Shadow (64:09 - 64:13)
raids that isn't in person but we can (64:12 - 64:18)
Circle back uh when we get here uh palan (64:13 - 64:20)

making even though it's they put a (64:44 - 64:48)
master ball on a Christmas tree like (64:47 - 64:50)

hopefully a third opportunity to add a (65:12 - 65:17)
master ball isn't far off this this is (65:15 - 65:18)
off (65:17 - 65:20)
pokemon.com we're going to trust them (65:18 - 65:22)
more than Niantic (65:20 - 65:25)
so uh journey is the destination they (65:22 - 65:28)
announced Roots which came out in July (65:25 - 65:31)
uh and during Roots you if you're lucky (65:28 - 65:34)
trainers you can find zygard cell (65:31 - 65:37)
cells uh by traveling (65:34 - 65:39)
Roots uh they talked about the world (65:37 - 65:44)

coming up for the next World (65:55 - 66:00)
Championships again this is their list (66:00 - 66:04)
of top 10 moments in Pokemon go they're (66:02 - 66:07)
mentioning the Halloween event uh the (66:04 - 66:09)
annual Halloween event is always buckets (66:07 - 66:12)
of treats no exception grieve gevard (66:09 - 66:15)
made their debut which is crazy we still (66:12 - 66:19)
don't have mimikyu yet um they they have (66:15 - 66:21)
the emergency mimikyu button when (66:19 - 66:22)
Pokemon go starts failing hit the (66:21 - 66:26)
mimikyu button (66:22 - 66:26)
uh they talk about the orange Pok√© stops (66:26 - 66:31)
pumpkins on the ground and (66:28 - 66:34)
then number nine is going to be Party (66:31 - 66:37)
play that launched on October 16th where (66:34 - 66:40)
you can form up in a group nice great (66:37 - 66:42)
throws spinning stops earning party (66:40 - 66:44)
rewards the party (66:42 - 66:47)
power and then finally they talk about (66:44 - 66:51)
how uh the game introduced (66:47 - 66:55)
Seasons there was five seasons in 20 23 (66:51 - 66:57)
year kicked off with season 9 of (66:55 - 67:00)
mythical wishes and then season 10 (66:57 - 67:03)
Rising Heroes which was ramed by the (67:00 - 67:06)
community as rising prices then (67:03 - 67:08)
following hidden gems and then after (67:06 - 67:10)
that was Adventures (67:08 - 67:12)
abound and then we are on the current (67:10 - 67:14)
season of Timeless (67:12 - 67:18)
travels so that is the 10 things (67:14 - 67:24)
pokemon.com said for 2023 which is a lot (67:18 - 67:24)
uh (67:24 - 67:28)
half of them aren't new (67:24 - 67:28)
though I mean I'm trying to get the (67:28 - 67:33)
exact number but primals are are are (67:30 - 67:35)
megas basically they're slightly (67:33 - 67:37)
different but they're basically megas (67:35 - 67:39)
yeah totally world champion is not a new (67:37 - 67:41)
thing the Halloween event has been a (67:39 - 67:44)
yearly thing every single year and (67:41 - 67:46)
seasons are also a regular thing at this (67:44 - 67:49)
point and even the hoen tour that (67:46 - 67:51)
technically was a new event but that's a (67:49 - 67:54)
yearly thing so half of these aren't (67:51 - 67:57)
aren't new were they maybe exciting (67:54 - 67:58)
parts of (67:57 - 68:00)
2023 (67:58 - 68:03)
yeah but they're not (68:00 - 68:03)
new (68:04 - 68:12)
uh yeah I I feel like we should have a I (68:07 - 68:13)
feel like going through seven years of (68:12 - 68:15)
Pokemon go would be very interesting and (68:13 - 68:16)
would take way too much time on this (68:15 - 68:18)
podcast but like I'm trying to even (68:16 - 68:20)
remember when Roots got or not Roots um (68:18 - 68:22)
what that thing (68:20 - 68:25)
Advent recently oh roots crazy adventure (68:22 - 68:28)
incense I think was was very exciting as (68:25 - 68:30)
well the the the the pandemic has thrown (68:28 - 68:33)
my time off of like what when did what (68:30 - 68:38)
come out at what point yeah 's gotten (68:33 - 68:43)
weird I don't I'm curious if (68:38 - 68:43)
like because I I do think there's a lot (68:44 - 68:49)
here right like the party play and Roots (68:46 - 68:53)
alone are two big features that for some (68:49 - 68:54)
people fell really I think I think for a (68:53 - 68:57)
lot of people felt really flat (68:54 - 69:00)
but are totally like new features right (68:57 - 69:02)
like even the master ball it's like the (69:00 - 69:04)
master ball has the same problem in go (69:02 - 69:06)
that it does the the main Series games (69:04 - 69:08)
is you're like scared to use it and you (69:06 - 69:09)
just never use it you're just like I (69:08 - 69:11)
don't know what to use it on so you just (69:09 - 69:12)
never use it like I I I could probably (69:11 - 69:16)
open up my copy of Pokemon Black from 12 (69:12 - 69:18)
years ago and I guarantee you I still (69:16 - 69:19)
the master ball in it CU like what what (69:18 - 69:21)
was I going to use it on and that's how (69:19 - 69:23)
I feel right now in go is like I don't (69:21 - 69:26)
know what to use them on like somebody (69:23 - 69:27)
could be like oh the glaring birds and (69:26 - 69:30)
it's like okay but like it's not as (69:27 - 69:32)
satisfying to catch them for me if I (69:30 - 69:34)
would use a master ball on them I want (69:32 - 69:37)
to get that tiny tiny tiny (69:34 - 69:39)
chance but even with the glaring birds (69:37 - 69:42)
like they're going to put them in raids (69:39 - 69:45)
eventually their pattern their patterns (69:42 - 69:48)
lend to just wait you'll get it (69:45 - 69:52)
EAS yeah like like yeah I could murb all (69:48 - 69:54)
the the next zaptos I see but I still (69:52 - 69:57)
don't have Articuno and Mal trce and (69:54 - 69:58)
it's like what if I just wait till they (69:57 - 70:00)
put them in raids what what what happens (69:58 - 70:02)
when they become shiny like that's what (70:00 - 70:05)
I'm waiting on like I I already have (70:02 - 70:08)
them in other games so like there there (70:05 - 70:11)
is like that kind it's not a problem but (70:08 - 70:13)
it's like you don't get anything for (70:11 - 70:15)
completing something like I'm not going (70:13 - 70:17)
to once I get my shiny (70:15 - 70:19)
goldine the only thing I'm going to get (70:17 - 70:22)
is like me screenshotting I did it and (70:19 - 70:23)
then like putting it on Twitter and (70:22 - 70:25)
getting like fake Internet points but (70:23 - 70:28)
like I'll feel good about it like like (70:25 - 70:30)
if Zapdos was my favorite Pokemon and (70:28 - 70:32)
Final Fantasy was my favorite series (70:30 - 70:34)
yeah I would probably masterball the (70:32 - 70:35)
gallerian zaptos because it looks like a (70:34 - 70:38)
chocobo like that's cool but like I (70:35 - 70:40)
think the master ball is cool I'm glad (70:38 - 70:41)
the master ball is there I'm glad that (70:40 - 70:45)
the master ball mission was like (70:41 - 70:48)
somewhat long and I wouldn't say (70:45 - 70:50)
challenging it's just like long and but (70:48 - 70:53)
like I I liked all of that it's just (70:50 - 70:56)
like (70:53 - 70:56)
like I understand that some people like (70:57 - 71:00)
very excited for the master ball they (70:59 - 71:02)
probably use their master ball they were (71:00 - 71:04)
satisfied with their master (71:02 - 71:08)
ball yeah and I guess going through this (71:04 - 71:11)
list and in case people haven't been (71:08 - 71:14)
around for as long as I've been on this (71:11 - 71:16)
show I love Pokemon go I would list (71:14 - 71:18)
Pokemon go as one of my favorite Pokemon (71:16 - 71:20)
games I'm being very critical of it (71:18 - 71:22)
because I'm a little bit worried about (71:20 - 71:25)
where it's at at this point in time so (71:22 - 71:27)
they got the mimiku button they don't (71:25 - 71:29)
know how to put mimikyu in PvP I'm (71:27 - 71:31)
convinced it would just break their (71:29 - 71:33)
whole meta (71:31 - 71:35)
yeah but going through this list what (71:33 - 71:37)
would be really nice is if they had done (71:35 - 71:39)
really good in-game events that had (71:37 - 71:41)
actually made people so excited and so (71:39 - 71:43)
happy that they would want to put those (71:41 - 71:46)
on this list other than just the yearly (71:43 - 71:49)
Halloween one and the it is their best (71:46 - 71:51)
event though right the Halloween one (71:49 - 71:54)
yeah yeah but they just announced a big (71:51 - 71:56)
fairy type one that I think people are (71:54 - 71:58)
going to be happy with and that dragon (71:56 - 72:01)
and fairy one that happened in 2022 I (71:58 - 72:02)
think people were really happy and (72:01 - 72:04)
excited about no that I I was actually (72:02 - 72:06)
going to bring up that I think this (72:04 - 72:08)
year's fairy event is bad like shiny (72:06 - 72:10)
cutie fly is coming that's fair that's (72:08 - 72:12)
fair but I think it's I think it's I (72:10 - 72:16)
think it's bad because last year's fairy (72:12 - 72:19)
dragon event was so it was two years ago (72:16 - 72:22)
I think it was 2022 it was so (72:19 - 72:24)
good it was it (72:22 - 72:27)
was it was one of the best events they (72:24 - 72:30)
did so I do think so going back to your (72:27 - 72:32)
question actually I'm surprised that (72:30 - 72:35)
showcases isn't on this list because I I (72:32 - 72:36)
think out of all the things they (72:35 - 72:40)
introduced Party play Roots (72:36 - 72:45)
masterball we're not counting megas (72:40 - 72:45)
um showcases are legitimately in my (72:45 - 72:52)
opinion cool like I love them I kind of (72:49 - 72:55)
wish there was (72:52 - 72:55)
like I think showcases rewards like the (72:57 - 73:03)
person living in the middle of nowhere (73:01 - 73:05)
because if you if if you have like a (73:03 - 73:07)
town of like 20,000 people and you have (73:05 - 73:09)
like one gym and like four Pok√© stops (73:07 - 73:11)
and one's a showcase you're probably (73:09 - 73:12)
always going to like win that and the (73:11 - 73:14)
rewards like I don't think this is (73:12 - 73:16)
talked about the rewards for winning a (73:14 - 73:18)
showcase are awesome like you get star (73:16 - 73:20)
pieces lucky eggs you get incubators (73:18 - 73:21)
like if you come in like top three like (73:20 - 73:25)
they're legitimately good for doing (73:21 - 73:27)
nothing well no they they are good they (73:25 - 73:29)
are good I'm shaking my head because I (73:27 - 73:30)
live in the middle of a city and also (73:29 - 73:32)
somehow nowhere near a single showcase (73:30 - 73:34)
so I've never won a (73:32 - 73:36)
showcase you can go to the Mall of (73:34 - 73:38)
America and hope you get there within (73:36 - 73:40)
the first three seconds of an opening oh (73:38 - 73:42)
my gosh yeah if you want to talk about (73:40 - 73:45)
like like the Mall of America privilege (73:42 - 73:46)
if if it's a community day and the (73:45 - 73:49)
Showcase opens at like 2 p.m. well I (73:46 - 73:50)
mean like Greg you're probably going to (73:49 - 73:53)
go tomorrow like if you do not enter a (73:50 - 73:54)
Pokemon with in the first 10 minutes at (73:53 - 73:56)
mall America it's full for the rest of (73:54 - 73:59)
the day it's done you you have to be you (73:56 - 74:01)
have to be there right at two and you (73:59 - 74:03)
have to be standing on it ready to drop (74:01 - 74:07)
your Pokemon yep um which is like CRA (74:03 - 74:08)
like I I go to the mall America like (74:07 - 74:11)
once a week to play go because I I (74:08 - 74:13)
legitimately like Pokemon go right and (74:11 - 74:16)
it's where else am I going to go in 20 (74:13 - 74:17)
degree weather right I'm gonna go to m (74:16 - 74:19)
America I'm G to walk in a circle I'm (74:17 - 74:21)
going to maybe get a boba te and then (74:19 - 74:24)
I'm going to go home after like an hour (74:21 - 74:26)
and even on Tuesdays I'll get there or (74:24 - 74:28)
or Wednesdays depending if I'm doing (74:26 - 74:30)
Spotlight hour or Raid hour and it's (74:28 - 74:31)
like oh a (74:30 - 74:34)
Showcase of course it's full it's full (74:31 - 74:36)
it's (74:34 - 74:36)
full but I yeah I I like showcases I (74:37 - 74:41)
wish there (74:40 - 74:44)
was I think my only thing for showcases (74:41 - 74:46)
I wish there was more variety I wish (74:44 - 74:49)
there was like tiny big heavy (74:46 - 74:51)
lightest not tallest I'm not sure what (74:49 - 74:54)
else they could do (74:51 - 74:56)
but (74:54 - 74:58)
um and and then there's the problem with (74:56 - 75:00)
showcases where they're just like not (74:58 - 75:04)
working where you're like oh it's ret (75:00 - 75:06)
Community day but that they're saying (75:04 - 75:08)
Squirtle is the Showcase Pokemon for (75:06 - 75:09)
whatever reason and you're like I can't (75:08 - 75:12)
even catch a squirtle so like that a (75:09 - 75:13)
problem with forms they had a problem (75:12 - 75:16)
with forms they tried to make showcases (75:13 - 75:17)
where you could enter Pokemon that had (75:16 - 75:19)
different forms and it didn't work so (75:17 - 75:21)
they had to switch was Wooper cuz wop's (75:19 - 75:24)
showcase was Squirtle (75:21 - 75:28)
can't even catch a squirtle yeah that (75:24 - 75:29)
wasn't even the only time that they had (75:28 - 75:31)
a problem with it they just couldn't get (75:29 - 75:32)
it to (75:31 - 75:34)
work and it was broken from the start (75:32 - 75:36)
that's another thing about these new (75:34 - 75:39)
features almost all of them with the (75:36 - 75:41)
exception of party play which was also (75:39 - 75:44)
broken but less um have been very broken (75:41 - 75:47)
when they've (75:44 - 75:49)
launched uh the the shadow raid stuff I (75:47 - 75:52)
think is (75:49 - 75:55)
cool like like the the Mewtwo was like (75:52 - 75:57)
the shadow raid like a lot of raid stuff (75:55 - 75:59)
is so dictated by like just the (75:57 - 76:01)
popularity of the Pokemon like it was so (75:59 - 76:04)
easy to get into Mewtwo Shadow (76:01 - 76:07)
raids because people want people like (76:04 - 76:09)
Mewtwo like Mewtwo is just an incredibly (76:07 - 76:10)
popular (76:09 - 76:13)
Pokemon um and then like for malra (76:10 - 76:14)
Articuno (76:13 - 76:16)
zaptos like I (76:14 - 76:20)
think if you went the first weekend that (76:16 - 76:23)
Articuno multra zaptos came out you (76:20 - 76:24)
would like find people at least in my (76:23 - 76:26)
area again I'm talking about my area I'm (76:24 - 76:28)
sure that that that those results vary (76:26 - 76:31)
but like week two week three week four (76:28 - 76:33)
or however long Niantic has repeated (76:31 - 76:35)
these every weekend it was just like (76:33 - 76:37)
less and less and less which is not (76:35 - 76:39)
exclusive to Shadow raids that's how (76:37 - 76:41)
every raid kind of has worked in Pokemon (76:39 - 76:43)
go like the first week is the good week (76:41 - 76:45)
and that's not exclusive to Pokemon go (76:43 - 76:47)
either that's very similar to almost (76:45 - 76:49)
every other game like even if you play (76:47 - 76:51)
scarlet and violet like the first two (76:49 - 76:52)
nights people are like seven star raids (76:51 - 76:54)
Seven Star raids and then all of a (76:52 - 76:55)
sudden if you're waiting you're like oh (76:54 - 76:57)
everyone's already done it people don't (76:55 - 76:59)
want to rerun it again or they like they (76:57 - 77:02)
don't have time (76:59 - 77:04)
um I don't think that's like niantic's (77:02 - 77:06)
problem specifically I think that's just (77:04 - 77:08)
like the fomo of gaming is like we got (77:06 - 77:10)
to do it now because no one's going to (77:08 - 77:11)
do it (77:10 - 77:13)
later my problem with like the shadow (77:11 - 77:16)
stuff is still there's like little to no (77:13 - 77:19)
reason to purify anything and so you (77:16 - 77:20)
look at these tournaments they talk (77:19 - 77:21)
about like the world championship of (77:20 - 77:23)
like Shadow Swamper being really good (77:21 - 77:25)
and I talked about earlier how I'm like (77:23 - 77:28)
saving teams I see on Twitter or (77:25 - 77:29)
whatever because it's like oh I want to (77:28 - 77:31)
build a new team for GBL and like I have (77:29 - 77:33)
a Reggie key but I don't have or not (77:31 - 77:35)
Reggie key I have a Reggie steel but I (77:33 - 77:36)
don't have (77:35 - 77:40)
this um oh I it was Poliwrath I saw a (77:36 - 77:42)
lot of shot out pow wraths and it was (77:40 - 77:44)
like that's that's cool I don't I don't (77:42 - 77:46)
have that I don't I I have no way of (77:44 - 77:49)
getting that I have a regular Poliwrath (77:46 - 77:51)
but apparently that's not good enough so (77:49 - 77:52)
it's (77:51 - 77:54)
like I get that Shadow Pokemon are like (77:52 - 77:56)
stronger but they take more damage but (77:54 - 77:58)
there's (77:56 - 78:00)
like nothing to purifying it which is (77:58 - 78:02)
the thing you're supposed like they want (78:00 - 78:04)
you to do right they want you to purify (78:02 - 78:05)
it but like you get punished for (78:04 - 78:08)
purifying it yeah storywise it does help (78:05 - 78:12)
the Pokemon Pur to purify it but being a (78:08 - 78:15)
good person is reward in itself yeah so (78:12 - 78:17)
it's like I I somebody's gonna be like (78:15 - 78:18)
well technically it's cheaper to power (78:17 - 78:21)
up true I like I I'm not disagreeing (78:18 - 78:23)
with that but like the only reason I (78:21 - 78:25)
could think the ever purifying a Pokemon (78:23 - 78:28)
is to like Mega Evolve it like if you or (78:25 - 78:29)
if it is a Pokemon like sabali ey or I (78:28 - 78:31)
think woba Fett where they actually can (78:29 - 78:34)
use the move return so those are (78:31 - 78:36)
actually good in purified form because (78:34 - 78:38)
they only get access to that move when (78:36 - 78:41)
purified but that's a very limited pool (78:38 - 78:42)
of (78:41 - 78:45)
Pokemon I wonder though if (78:42 - 78:48)
like I wonder how much of 2023 in (78:45 - 78:50)
Pok√©mon go was like (78:48 - 78:54)
soured because of the remote raid p past (78:50 - 78:57)
changes (78:54 - 79:00)
like the thing we cut out last week was (78:57 - 79:02)
a conversation of like people talking (79:00 - 79:04)
about how Pokemon go is like dying or (79:02 - 79:06)
this might be the final year which I (79:04 - 79:09)
disagree with um I don't think it's (79:06 - 79:12)
dying but when I look at the past year I (79:09 - 79:15)
don't really see anything bad I see (79:12 - 79:17)
features that some people care about and (79:15 - 79:20)
some people don't but that's like every (79:17 - 79:24)
game like GBL has been going pretty okay (79:20 - 79:27)
and I don't really care about GBL and (79:24 - 79:31)
some events are good some are not like (79:27 - 79:34)
that one Dragon fairy event was like so (79:31 - 79:36)
good and this like new fairy event is (79:34 - 79:37)
like it's okay I don't think it's I (79:36 - 79:39)
don't think it's bad it's just not as (79:37 - 79:41)
good as past events um like the (79:39 - 79:43)
Halloween event is always (79:41 - 79:45)
good and I don't know what they're going (79:43 - 79:47)
to do around the CNO thing I guess we'll (79:45 - 79:51)
see if the global CNO thing is good but (79:47 - 79:51)
like I don't know how we got to (79:52 - 79:59)
like all of a sudden Pokemon go is dying (79:56 - 80:03)
during the least busy time of Pokemon go (79:59 - 80:05)
which is January like if you look at the (80:03 - 80:07)
past year you're like they did a lot but (80:05 - 80:09)
also again I just wonder how many people (80:07 - 80:11)
are just still soured which (80:09 - 80:12)
understandable if you're soured about (80:11 - 80:14)
the remote R passes I'm not saying don't (80:12 - 80:16)
be soured about it or don't like if (80:14 - 80:18)
raiding was your one thing yeah you (80:16 - 80:19)
probably wouldn't care about routes you (80:18 - 80:22)
probably wouldn't care about Party play (80:19 - 80:24)
cuz you're sitting at home remoting into (80:22 - 80:27)
raids like a lot of these features are (80:24 - 80:30)
go out and do that and if your bread and (80:27 - 80:34)
butter for this game was Crank That slot (80:30 - 80:39)
machine dollar for mtrace dollar for (80:34 - 80:41)
Metagross dollar for whatever other (80:39 - 80:43)
Pokemon Wen raids (80:41 - 80:46)
traan and they took that away from you (80:43 - 80:48)
and they haven't changed it they're (80:46 - 80:51)
they're very hard on (80:48 - 80:54)
like I mean we've we've had had the raid (80:51 - 80:57)
pass conversation but I do think that (80:54 - 80:58)
there is something to the fact that they (80:57 - 81:01)
took away the main thing that people did (80:58 - 81:03)
with online (81:01 - 81:05)
communities and they haven't added (81:03 - 81:07)
anything else because they are so (81:05 - 81:09)
focused on getting people to form in (81:07 - 81:11)
person communities and I still think (81:09 - 81:13)
that there are things they could add (81:11 - 81:16)
that support both I have thrown out the (81:13 - 81:19)
O power idea and I'm still pretty stuck (81:16 - 81:20)
on it because that's something where you (81:19 - 81:22)
could help your online community you (81:20 - 81:24)
could help someone you're friends with (81:22 - 81:25)
elsewhere in the world but that would (81:24 - 81:29)
also get you outside or get you in (81:25 - 81:31)
places where there might be inperson (81:29 - 81:32)
community and I think they need more (81:31 - 81:35)
features that are like that because they (81:32 - 81:37)
did have this game that built up a whole (81:35 - 81:39)
ton of online communities over the last (81:37 - 81:41)
few (81:39 - 81:43)
years and they're just not supporting (81:41 - 81:45)
that at all anymore and to what you were (81:43 - 81:47)
saying about the list I look at this (81:45 - 81:49)
list and I see a bunch of features that (81:47 - 81:52)
were just broken and they're not (81:49 - 81:54)
necessarily as broken (81:52 - 81:57)
anymore but but I got real soured on (81:54 - 81:59)
them when they (81:57 - 82:02)
launched and they were not fun because (81:59 - 82:04)
you couldn't do them or they didn't work (82:02 - 82:07)
right or there was no way to make a (82:04 - 82:08)
route or there weren't any routes near (82:07 - 82:11)
me and things like that along with the (82:08 - 82:15)
fact that yes it is the slow season but (82:11 - 82:16)
every single event is coming with a (82:15 - 82:20)
ticket and that's really (82:16 - 82:23)
uncomfortable yeah and that (82:20 - 82:26)
all of these things I I (82:23 - 82:31)
I like the you know what's funny is uh I (82:26 - 82:35)
said like I I would pay $10 a month for (82:31 - 82:36)
another (82:35 - 82:38)
incubator like I think having two (82:36 - 82:40)
permanent incubators is like a better (82:38 - 82:43)
for those shiny baby Pokemon yeah yeah I (82:40 - 82:44)
need the shiny B that's true I need to (82:43 - 82:46)
finish jto shiny baby Pokemon but like I (82:44 - 82:49)
think of like what would a monthly (82:46 - 82:51)
subscription of Pok√©mon go be and I'm I (82:49 - 82:53)
I'm not 100% sure what that would look (82:51 - 82:55)
like although it's kind of in the game (82:53 - 82:57)
right now (82:55 - 83:00)
like Niantic like this is the second (82:57 - 83:02)
month Niantic has done the like for $5 (83:00 - 83:05)
you get an incubator every day for (83:02 - 83:07)
spinning a pok√© stop which accomplishes (83:05 - 83:09)
what they want number one is incubators (83:07 - 83:11)
are you have to go out and get it so you (83:09 - 83:12)
have to leave your house unless you live (83:11 - 83:17)
on a pok√© stop then lucky you um and you (83:12 - 83:19)
have to walk right like that's the whole (83:17 - 83:21)
point of incubators is walking so they (83:19 - 83:23)
they're kind of they're still hitting (83:21 - 83:24)
their quota of like we want you to go (83:23 - 83:28)
out and play I think getting one (83:24 - 83:30)
incubator a day even though it's a (83:28 - 83:35)
onetime use is better than a permanent (83:30 - 83:37)
incubator because like I'm not walking a (83:35 - 83:41)
lot because it's cold and also there's (83:37 - 83:42)
this game called scarlin Violet which (83:41 - 83:44)
just had new DLC which I've been playing (83:42 - 83:46)
a lot of so I haven't had time for (83:44 - 83:49)
Pokemon go but now I (83:46 - 83:52)
have at the end of this month I will (83:49 - 83:55)
have 6 one-time use incubators which is (83:52 - 84:00)
kind of awesome for $10 and when I go to (83:55 - 84:02)
C (84:00 - 84:06)
whatever uh c tour I will I will have so (84:02 - 84:09)
many incubators and I won't have to buy (84:06 - 84:11)
anything so (84:09 - 84:13)
like I guess we we'll we'll probably (84:11 - 84:14)
Circle back because we're running long (84:13 - 84:17)
uh but I (84:14 - 84:17)
I I think they are ticketing a lot of (84:17 - 84:24)
stuff and I think that's (84:21 - 84:27)
fine because you don't have to buy it (84:24 - 84:29)
but also I think what we said last week (84:27 - 84:32)
which got cut is just do just do a (84:29 - 84:37)
monthly pass just get like do $7.99 or (84:32 - 84:39)
109 or $10 a month do this egg thing (84:37 - 84:41)
you're doing because I think that's fine (84:39 - 84:44)
and maybe it's working I I don't know (84:41 - 84:46)
how many people are buying the $5 thing (84:44 - 84:48)
I I have I was gifted at last month from (84:46 - 84:50)
a friend I bought it this month for (84:48 - 84:52)
myself I'm probably going to buy it (84:50 - 84:55)
again cuz I think it's cuz you get like (84:52 - 84:57)
you get extra experience your first (84:55 - 84:59)
Catch of the Day I think you get extra (84:57 - 85:00)
Stardust your first catch you you get a (84:59 - 85:02)
bunch of stuff you get pretty much (85:00 - 85:04)
everything you would ideally get in like (85:02 - 85:07)
a monthly pass but then it's like $2 (85:04 - 85:11)
here a dollar here for Community Day $2 (85:07 - 85:13)
here for this and it adds (85:11 - 85:15)
up it adds up to maybe what you would (85:13 - 85:17)
expect for a monthly pass but when it's (85:15 - 85:19)
broken down into that many different (85:17 - 85:21)
things when they're asking you to pay (85:19 - 85:24)
over and over and over again it's just (85:21 - 85:26)
uncomfortable it's just making me feel (85:24 - 85:28)
gross about it just make a monthly pass (85:26 - 85:31)
and then have those things separate so (85:28 - 85:33)
if somebody's like oh I'm I'm just going (85:31 - 85:34)
to buy the rowlet commun day because (85:33 - 85:37)
that's all I'm going to play that that's (85:34 - 85:40)
fine let them spend their dollar (85:37 - 85:43)
then it's just like really weird I there (85:40 - 85:45)
there is something that's like you open (85:43 - 85:46)
up Pokemon go and it's like five (85:45 - 85:48)
different things you can (85:46 - 85:50)
buy and if you haven't been in the game (85:48 - 85:52)
for a while you're like what are what (85:50 - 85:54)
are all these things for like what is (85:52 - 85:56)
this $5 for versus this $2 versus this (85:54 - 85:58)
$1 versus (85:56 - 86:01)
just just do the World of Warcraft thing (85:58 - 86:03)
where like make a monthly pass and then (86:01 - 86:05)
people buy it then they forget about it (86:03 - 86:07)
and they're like I've been subed to (86:05 - 86:08)
World of Warcraft for three years I (86:07 - 86:12)
don't know what I'm I'm not even playing (86:08 - 86:12)
it Greg knows at least 10 of those (86:13 - 86:19)
people oh yeah 100% know (86:16 - 86:23)
them when the last time you played world (86:19 - 86:26)
I only play Final Fantasy 14 one day a (86:23 - 86:28)
week and I'm paying a monthly fee for it (86:26 - 86:31)
but that one day a week is important 15 (86:28 - 86:35)
bucks for Final Fantasy right if you do (86:31 - 86:37)
it monthly if you do the discounts is (86:35 - 86:41)
12 oh inflation hasn't come to those (86:37 - 86:43)
games yet e haven't I mean they're (86:41 - 86:46)
fighting against free games that don't (86:43 - 86:48)
have it and have microtransactions so (86:46 - 86:50)
they're they're walking that line of (86:48 - 86:53)
they're one of the only MMOs left that (86:50 - 86:57)
charge a monthly fee there are not many (86:53 - 87:01)
of them left so they're like we we can't (86:57 - 87:04)
really go much much beyond what we've (87:01 - 87:06)
done because people are still willing to (87:04 - 87:08)
pay this but we're it's like Final (87:06 - 87:10)
Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft for (87:08 - 87:12)
like the last two that charge monthly (87:10 - 87:14)
fee and everybody else has got premium (87:12 - 87:16)
do you think that's why Pogo hasn't done (87:14 - 87:18)
their a monthly fee (87:16 - 87:20)
there yeah is it just not working (87:18 - 87:21)
anymore it's not working anymore it's (87:20 - 87:24)
not it's people see it as a viable (87:21 - 87:26)
solution um (87:24 - 87:29)
it's for a lot of the reasons that a lot (87:26 - 87:32)
of monthly subscription (87:29 - 87:36)
fees people are in the mindset of I will (87:32 - 87:38)
forget about this and I'll get charged (87:36 - 87:41)
for something that I am not using like (87:38 - 87:43)
that is much more in the common ideas (87:41 - 87:46)
like whole ad campaigns about buy a (87:43 - 87:47)
product that will cancel all of your (87:46 - 87:50)
unused subscriptions like that's part of (87:47 - 87:54)
the idea of of just where I think (87:50 - 87:56)
consumerism is right now so we're in a (87:54 - 87:59)
weird moment (87:56 - 88:02)
of people are haven't cut on to being (87:59 - 88:04)
nickel and nimed because that was the (88:02 - 88:06)
thing back when I was growing up (88:04 - 88:07)
everything came with a little extra (88:06 - 88:09)
charge so you're being nickeled and (88:07 - 88:11)
dimed to death and then it changed she (88:09 - 88:14)
we just pay one monthly fee and you're (88:11 - 88:15)
on a budget it never changes so you (88:14 - 88:17)
always can prepare for that and now (88:15 - 88:19)
we're sort of flipping back to the other (88:17 - 88:21)
way of thinking of well I'm wasting (88:19 - 88:23)
money if I don't use it so I only want (88:21 - 88:26)
to pay for it when I need (88:23 - 88:29)
it but again we're going back to the (88:26 - 88:32)
okay so now Pok√©mon go has 17 tickets (88:29 - 88:33)
and you feel like I'm being nickel to (88:32 - 88:36)
Dime to death I'd rather pay just for (88:33 - 88:38)
Access for it there's not a good middle (88:36 - 88:42)
ground for any of it (88:38 - 88:46)
um I mean it's also competing against (88:42 - 88:48)
other video games where you pay for it (88:46 - 88:51)
once and then you get stuff and you (88:48 - 88:53)
don't have to pay (88:51 - 88:56)
again for a lot of things right like you (88:53 - 88:59)
pay your $60 and you have a (88:56 - 89:01)
game and then if they're going to add a (88:59 - 89:03)
DLC you might pay more or sometimes you (89:01 - 89:07)
won't like there's so many (89:03 - 89:07)
different ways that people look at Value (89:07 - 89:13)
that I think it's incredibly difficult (89:11 - 89:16)
for them to find a good way and when you (89:13 - 89:19)
get I I told this is true is when you (89:16 - 89:24)
see the money as the main driver and not (89:19 - 89:26)
fun is when you're getting quickly over (89:24 - 89:30)
that game like when the thing comes to (89:26 - 89:33)
why am I paying money for (89:30 - 89:37)
this you're you you're on the path out (89:33 - 89:39)
you're on the you're on the road to (89:37 - 89:41)
leave that game it is no longer offering (89:39 - 89:43)
you value and I I think one of the (89:41 - 89:46)
issues that Pokemon go is having I think (89:43 - 89:48)
Hannah is correct is I don't know that (89:46 - 89:52)
they have a good enough idea or big (89:48 - 89:55)
enough event to turn that around for a (89:52 - 89:57)
lot of people so that they are no longer (89:55 - 90:00)
seeing the money and I think the raid (89:57 - 90:04)
change was the biggest shot in people's (90:00 - 90:05)
arms (90:04 - 90:10)
of oh this is a money (90:05 - 90:14)
thing I'm I'm paying now more for a (90:10 - 90:17)
thing and it really brought the money to (90:14 - 90:20)
the Forefront and has set this sort of (90:17 - 90:22)
expectation of people scrutinizing ing (90:20 - 90:25)
what Pokemon go charges them I think (90:22 - 90:27)
that was a huge PR (90:25 - 90:30)
error and one that they haven't (90:27 - 90:32)
recovered from and one that they don't (90:30 - 90:36)
have a good idea to Eclipse yet um I (90:32 - 90:39)
think the live in-person things the (90:36 - 90:41)
money of that gets wrapped up in the (90:39 - 90:43)
cost of travel so when you're talking (90:41 - 90:46)
about I'm paying $200 for a hotel room (90:43 - 90:49)
but only $15 for the event you have that (90:46 - 90:52)
weird scale of this is a drop in the (90:49 - 90:55)
bucket to what I'm doing whereas I don't (90:52 - 90:57)
want to pay $5 to go to the Mall of (90:55 - 90:59)
America for an hour to do raids like I (90:57 - 91:01)
don't want to I don't to pay for that I (90:59 - 91:03)
don't want to that's not a particularly (91:01 - 91:08)
fun thing to pay five dollars for like I (91:03 - 91:11)
I I don't know how they fix it I don't (91:08 - 91:14)
know if they can fix it I don't know (91:11 - 91:17)
what at this point in that game would be (91:14 - 91:18)
so (91:17 - 91:21)
revolutionary that it would make people (91:18 - 91:22)
do a reset (91:21 - 91:24)
in their expectations and what they feel (91:22 - 91:27)
about the (91:24 - 91:27)
game yeah I I there's probably a feature (91:27 - 91:32)
that brings people back I don't know (91:31 - 91:34)
what that is maybe like breeding or (91:32 - 91:37)
something um it's not routes it's not (91:34 - 91:38)
routes it's not the master (91:37 - 91:41)
ball I I I (91:38 - 91:44)
think also they're they're (91:41 - 91:50)
incredibly strict focus on in-person (91:44 - 91:50)
experiences alien a lot more of America (91:50 - 91:56)
than they want to (91:54 - 92:00)
admit it's really hard for Americans who (91:56 - 92:02)
where were really really really spread (92:00 - 92:07)
out to get inperson events to feel super (92:02 - 92:10)
magical without a lot of work and a lot (92:07 - 92:11)
of that work is done on the backs of (92:10 - 92:15)
people for free um you know it's (92:11 - 92:19)
different Japan is a much different size (92:15 - 92:22)
shape location of a country you know (92:19 - 92:25)
it's not like we do a podcast with a (92:22 - 92:28)
person that's on the other coast you (92:25 - 92:30)
know like that is an American thing (92:28 - 92:33)
people don't understand how big America (92:30 - 92:35)
is I had a person who flew into Chicago (92:33 - 92:37)
it's like well come see me for the (92:35 - 92:39)
weekend I'm like you don't understand on (92:37 - 92:43)
the map yes this that's a 9h hour trip I (92:39 - 92:45)
can't just get to Chicago from where I (92:43 - 92:47)
am that's the size we're dealing with in (92:45 - 92:50)
America that a lot of other countries (92:47 - 92:53)
don't have as part of their their (92:50 - 92:56)
experience like people watching people (92:53 - 92:58)
talk about like oh I would never travel (92:56 - 93:00)
an hour in England to go from this town (92:58 - 93:02)
to this town and people in the South are (93:00 - 93:04)
like I drive two hours to work every day (93:02 - 93:07)
what are you talking about yeah like it (93:04 - 93:10)
is just a very (93:07 - 93:13)
different it's a very different thing (93:10 - 93:16)
and I I don't know given how extensive (93:13 - 93:17)
and you touch on them with the route (93:16 - 93:20)
like how extensive Japan is for Pokemon (93:17 - 93:24)
go I don't know that they honestly have (93:20 - 93:27)
a lot of great ideas to fix the America (93:24 - 93:29)
problem and I don't know that there's a (93:27 - 93:32)
lot of value in them fixing the America (93:29 - 93:35)
problem yeah I I said this last week (93:32 - 93:37)
sorry it was cut I will say it again (93:35 - 93:41)
even if America gave up on Pokemon go it (93:37 - 93:45)
would be fine in Japan yeah it would be (93:41 - 93:48)
it it just it's it's it's like a whole (93:45 - 93:50)
it feels like a whole different game (93:48 - 93:53)
over there it really does like I I watch (93:50 - 93:54)
a streamer (93:53 - 93:58)
who they are an hour outside of Tokyo (93:54 - 94:02)
and like Tokyo very big city (93:58 - 94:04)
and they they have to take an hour train (94:02 - 94:06)
ride to get into Tokyo and they do it (94:04 - 94:10)
most days but like you would if if I was (94:06 - 94:13)
an hour away from like Milwaukee or (94:10 - 94:16)
Minneapolis I would have nothing around (94:13 - 94:20)
me I would be but like their playing (94:16 - 94:22)
situation an hour away is is still (94:20 - 94:24)
better than most American cities they (94:22 - 94:26)
just have because there's a train (94:24 - 94:27)
station there and around the train (94:26 - 94:28)
station is a bunch of restaurants and a (94:27 - 94:32)
bunch of restaurants is a bunch of small (94:28 - 94:34)
businesses it's like the standard (94:32 - 94:37)
Japanese experience just not in Tokyo (94:34 - 94:39)
just to but it's still like yeah oh (94:37 - 94:41)
there's a lot to do out here still (94:39 - 94:44)
because everything is so compact in (94:41 - 94:46)
Japan their public transportation is (94:44 - 94:50)
amazing like they like and our outside (94:46 - 94:52)
Minneapolis is nowhere land (94:50 - 94:55)
we are hitting Farm country you go an (94:52 - 94:59)
hour north and you are out of City you (94:55 - 95:01)
are out of suburbs if I go if I go an (94:59 - 95:04)
hour south I'm in uh Rochester and (95:01 - 95:06)
there's like nothing there either it's (95:04 - 95:08)
just a bunch (95:06 - 95:11)
of yeah a bunch of hospitals and kexs (95:08 - 95:13)
that's all there is I mean sorry to (95:11 - 95:15)
anyone in (95:13 - 95:18)
Rochester I haven't been to Japan since (95:15 - 95:20)
Pok√©mon go came out but Steve you went (95:18 - 95:22)
to the fossil Museum (95:20 - 95:25)
with the Pokemon exhibit there right (95:22 - 95:27)
that was kind of in rural japanish or at (95:25 - 95:29)
least farther away that was that was (95:27 - 95:31)
three hours away from Tokyo yeah how was (95:29 - 95:34)
the Pokemon go situation out there uh if (95:31 - 95:38)
you remember it was it was good um like (95:34 - 95:40)
not amazing but like the museum itself (95:38 - 95:42)
was like on like a bigger Park and there (95:40 - 95:46)
was I think still like two gyms and (95:42 - 95:48)
probably five or six Pok√© stops so like (95:46 - 95:51)
you could play at the Museum it was a (95:48 - 95:53)
maybe a 15 20 minute walk from the (95:51 - 95:55)
museum to (95:53 - 95:58)
the station and that was like probably (95:55 - 96:00)
the most cars I saw in Japan cuz there (95:58 - 96:04)
was like three hours away from Tokyo (96:00 - 96:07)
right like so like they had an actual (96:04 - 96:09)
yeah they had like an actual parking lot (96:07 - 96:11)
which you don't see a lot of in Japan of (96:09 - 96:13)
like oh like this looks like an American (96:11 - 96:16)
parking lot because people need to drive (96:13 - 96:20)
to this Museum and park um so when we (96:16 - 96:21)
were walking back there was not a lot of (96:20 - 96:23)
Pok√© stops cuz we were walking like (96:21 - 96:25)
behind people's like Little Farms like (96:23 - 96:28)
not big farms but like you know like (96:25 - 96:29)
half an acre where they growing like (96:28 - 96:32)
beats and stuff so there was maybe the (96:29 - 96:34)
20 minute walk back there was maybe only (96:32 - 96:35)
like one Pok√© stop and then when we got (96:34 - 96:37)
back to the train station um there's (96:35 - 96:39)
like another like gym and another like (96:37 - 96:41)
three Pok stops and then like every (96:39 - 96:44)
train station or every station we like (96:41 - 96:48)
stopped at gym couple Pok√© stops but I (96:44 - 96:49)
mean that doesn't sound too far off of (96:48 - 96:51)
what I see here in American cities it's (96:49 - 96:54)
just that the cities in Japan are so (96:51 - 96:57)
packed with Pok√©mon go MH I think that's (96:54 - 96:59)
the main difference because there there (96:57 - 97:01)
are rural parts of Japan I have spent (96:59 - 97:03)
over a month maybe two or three months (97:01 - 97:07)
in rural Japan but they also have a a (97:03 - 97:09)
better infrastructure for travel they (97:07 - 97:12)
have train systems like we just don't (97:09 - 97:14)
have we just don't (97:12 - 97:17)
have infrastructur to support more (97:14 - 97:19)
passive (97:17 - 97:22)
travel all of our travel is really (97:19 - 97:25)
active here like you have to have a car (97:22 - 97:28)
or you are dealing with a flight because (97:25 - 97:30)
we just don't have a train system (97:28 - 97:33)
anymore we sort of have a bus system but (97:30 - 97:38)
that's that's falling apart too um (97:33 - 97:42)
like and we are hu like even Japan has (97:38 - 97:46)
rural systems it is still shorter to get (97:42 - 97:50)
to a city than if you are at the border (97:46 - 97:52)
of Minnesota and having to come all the (97:50 - 97:54)
way down to Minneapolis which is a (97:52 - 97:57)
4-Hour drive and there's no train (97:54 - 97:59)
there's no nothing there's nothing in (97:57 - 98:02)
between there are tiny towns that (97:59 - 98:05)
probably don't even have stops because (98:02 - 98:07)
why would they there's nobody who lives (98:05 - 98:10)
out there plus the way that we run our (98:07 - 98:13)
Telecom where there aren't people there (98:10 - 98:15)
aren't (98:13 - 98:18)
Towers so in rural areas they just don't (98:15 - 98:20)
have the infrastructure to even play the (98:18 - 98:24)
game like it is just a different America (98:20 - 98:27)
is just a capitalistic problem of both (98:24 - 98:30)
size and scale and willingness to spend (98:27 - 98:33)
money and you know this is the thing (98:30 - 98:34)
that I had to deal with when I was (98:33 - 98:36)
worked for AT&T people would call us in (98:34 - 98:37)
the middle of Montana and we're like I (98:36 - 98:38)
don't know what to tell you you live in (98:37 - 98:40)
a town with three people we're not (98:38 - 98:43)
building a tower there there's no point (98:40 - 98:46)
it's not going to happen you have like (98:43 - 98:48)
get something else because you're never (98:46 - 98:50)
going to get cell service out there cuz (98:48 - 98:53)
nobody lives there there and it costs $3 (98:50 - 98:56)
million to build a (98:53 - 98:56)
tower yeah when I when I went to a (98:57 - 99:03)
bachelor party which was past duth like (99:00 - 99:06)
near Grand morray yeah way up up you're (99:03 - 99:08)
getting up to the Boundary Waters at (99:06 - 99:11)
that point there there I I was there for (99:08 - 99:13)
four days there was no Pok√© stop there (99:11 - 99:15)
was one there was like one spawn then I (99:13 - 99:17)
think this was before your like daily (99:15 - 99:20)
set spawn that would pop up and I was (99:17 - 99:23)
like if if this was my living situation (99:20 - 99:25)
I would delete this game yeah it (99:23 - 99:27)
wouldn't even be worth like finding an (99:25 - 99:29)
online community to rate for what what (99:27 - 99:30)
am (99:29 - 99:33)
I what am I catching besides like (99:30 - 99:35)
opening a game spending a dollar and (99:33 - 99:37)
remoting in I know that is like a (99:35 - 99:38)
reality for some people that they like (99:37 - 99:41)
Pokemon so much and they they live in (99:38 - 99:43)
the middle of nowhere and remoting was (99:41 - 99:45)
their only way in but (99:43 - 99:49)
like I couldn't do it like I I would (99:45 - 99:50)
just delete it this just the game is not (99:49 - 99:54)
for me um like I I've stopped playing (99:50 - 99:56)
Pikmin completely not because I hate (99:54 - 99:57)
Pikmin or pikmin's dying or I got bored (99:56 - 99:59)
with Pikmin I stopped playing Pikmin (99:57 - 100:01)
because I've just been busy with other (99:59 - 100:05)
games and I can't go outside and walk I (100:01 - 100:06)
just can't do (100:05 - 100:08)
it like hopefully I will be able to pick (100:06 - 100:11)
Pikmin back up when it gets nice out but (100:08 - 100:12)
like at (100:11 - 100:15)
least at least there are things to do in (100:12 - 100:17)
Pokemon go at your house like there's (100:15 - 100:19)
still like maintenance there's like (100:17 - 100:20)
evolving there's like still things you (100:19 - 100:23)
can do in Pikmin there is nothing you (100:20 - 100:25)
can do at your house you need to like (100:23 - 100:28)
leave and (100:25 - 100:28)
walk there's absolutely nothing in that (100:28 - 100:35)
game that you can really do from home (100:31 - 100:38)
um yeah so (100:35 - 100:42)
uh I I don't know what 2024 looks like (100:38 - 100:45)
for Pokemon go they usually release new (100:42 - 100:48)
features I don't know what they can (100:45 - 100:50)
release but hey that's not our job (100:48 - 100:51)
that's their job they're they supposed (100:50 - 100:54)
to be the creative (100:51 - 100:57)
people I kind of hope they focus on (100:54 - 100:58)
fixing (100:57 - 101:01)
stuff and I mean there there was a (100:58 - 101:04)
developer interview a month ago where (101:01 - 101:06)
the person who was being interviewed (101:04 - 101:08)
said that in 20123 they had shipped a (101:06 - 101:10)
lot of new features and that they also (101:08 - 101:13)
hoped that maybe in the upcoming year (101:10 - 101:15)
they would focus a little more on (101:13 - 101:16)
continuing to improve the things that (101:15 - 101:19)
they had (101:16 - 101:19)
shipped we just have to see if they're (101:19 - 101:25)
allowed to do that yeah it's tough I (101:22 - 101:29)
mean when you launch (101:25 - 101:32)
something new and it doesn't work in an (101:29 - 101:34)
already hostile (101:32 - 101:36)
environment there's it's so hard to come (101:34 - 101:39)
back from that because people are like (101:36 - 101:40)
you fix it and then you're going to have (101:39 - 101:42)
to rely on your people to be like no no (101:40 - 101:44)
it's fixed it's much better now and (101:42 - 101:48)
they're like but is it like that is Mega (101:44 - 101:51)
situation gave the mega situation gives (101:48 - 101:54)
me hope just because they've done it (101:51 - 101:57)
once people who play it now but do we (101:54 - 101:59)
know a ton of people that like well they (101:57 - 102:03)
fixed megas so I'm back (101:59 - 102:03)
in like that is a hard sell I don't know (102:03 - 102:09)
I I do think about again sitting at Mall (102:07 - 102:12)
of America where was I I was I was there (102:09 - 102:13)
for whatever what was the last Spotlight (102:12 - 102:16)
hour oh it was it was C form so I came (102:13 - 102:18)
at the end of C form because I wanted to (102:16 - 102:21)
miss it because I wanted to hunt the (102:18 - 102:24)
toot and there was a bunch of raids and (102:21 - 102:26)
I I've said this before I'll say this (102:24 - 102:28)
again and the raids at M America always (102:26 - 102:30)
fill up right it doesn't matter what (102:28 - 102:31)
Pokemon it is it will it will probably (102:30 - 102:33)
get to 20 no (102:31 - 102:37)
problem and you know radic with Hats (102:33 - 102:40)
Gengar with Hats bwell whatever and just (102:37 - 102:43)
the the the thing that is not shocking (102:40 - 102:45)
to me which I think a lot of like online (102:43 - 102:48)
vocal people that are like Pokemon go is (102:45 - 102:50)
dying or whatever or like the game is (102:48 - 102:51)
boring (102:50 - 102:53)
there is like every time I joined one of (102:51 - 102:55)
those raids and this is frequently this (102:53 - 102:57)
is not specifically this past weekend or (102:55 - 102:58)
or the past month this is just (102:57 - 103:01)
frequently the amount of people that are (102:58 - 103:04)
like level 22 27 (103:01 - 103:08)
39 like no one is using megas is just (103:04 - 103:10)
it's not shocking anymore it's it's the (103:08 - 103:12)
reality of the player base like I think (103:10 - 103:14)
there's this this weird perception that (103:12 - 103:17)
oh everyone is like level 46 and (103:14 - 103:19)
everyone has optimal counters and (103:17 - 103:21)
optimal omegas like (103:19 - 103:24)
like even even when I was in Seattle for (103:21 - 103:26)
go Fest and I'm joining raids and stuff (103:24 - 103:28)
the amount of people that like there's (103:26 - 103:31)
no reason not to mega mega literally (103:28 - 103:34)
anything you will just get more candy if (103:31 - 103:35)
you're sitting here doing raids these (103:34 - 103:38)
raids are filling up why just Mega so (103:35 - 103:41)
you have beill everyone has Beedrill (103:38 - 103:43)
just Mega the Beedrill you'll get more (103:41 - 103:46)
candy and it's just it's it's not Shock (103:43 - 103:49)
like it's shocking to me that people (103:46 - 103:51)
think that like everyone is like at (103:49 - 103:53)
endgame in Pokemon go and we're all (103:51 - 103:56)
bored like there's just so many people (103:53 - 103:59)
that are like playing this game every (103:56 - 104:02)
day and they're like level 32 it's the (103:59 - 104:04)
same people say that like the amount of (104:02 - 104:08)
think pieces and tweets about how Final (104:04 - 104:11)
Fantasy 14 is dead it's like no you're (104:08 - 104:12)
just at endgame and there's nothing to (104:11 - 104:15)
do I know a ton of people who are still (104:12 - 104:18)
working through the beginning levels and (104:15 - 104:22)
leveling up it's just that because again (104:18 - 104:26)
you just it's where you're at and people (104:22 - 104:28)
have a real difficult time of (104:26 - 104:29)
understanding that you're personal (104:28 - 104:31)
experience is not a universal experience (104:29 - 104:34)
it's not exactly what's going on there (104:31 - 104:36)
are other promise you there are people (104:34 - 104:37)
who are playing the (104:36 - 104:41)
game uh just maybe not in the way that (104:37 - 104:43)
