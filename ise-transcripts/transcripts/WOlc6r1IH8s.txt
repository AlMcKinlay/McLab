fund up of all those sales I can't talk all those sales help support it's super effective and the podcast so if you are interested in that stuff you can head over to pkmn cast calm and there's a store button right in the menu bar so check out that stuff and if you're interested cool if not no big deal enjoy the episode [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 266 episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host SBJ it's super effective with me today I have will yeah I was gonna say that we're fortuitous because I just hatched a snubbull in Pokemon moon and that that launched and go so smooth so maybe the snubbull is actually a sign of danger to come in poke my gorgeous danger sitting right here no no for this program house record is recording I see this disaster that we're about to stumble into Trev that thing we're about to do Travis you're back you're here it's true I've been gone so long that some some I feel like a lot of incredibly important things that happened in my life first of off I'm in first of all I'm engaged now which is a big deal but perhaps more importantly I like Zelda now why which is a thing which is the thing I didn't like before I don't why all right let's get real why should I let's talk about the important thing right now yeah Zelda well first off when you say that you're engaged that means like to be married to another human being right correct so Travis proposed to an attendance which is okay he'll in love with Zelda yeah so my fiance Carly basically told me like you never buy anything for yourself so I mean that's kind of noted on the show right that I have the launched version of whatever handheld console comes out I never get the upgraded DES or 3ds or anything I always end up with just with the launched one and I never upgrade so it's documented on the show that I never get anything for myself so she told me that I should buy a thing for myself and so I bought a switch and there's like one game on the switch so know even though I'm wrong even there you idiot Tetris I'm yeah I know I would be terrible at it I'll probably get it at some point along with us nipper clips or snipper Clippers whatever it's called anyway so I bought Zelda it's a good game turns out all that Legend of Zelda had to do to win me over was make a game that's actually like good and fun turns out that's the only thing they needed to do to make me like it how rare animals are these pretty different yeah I thought you were going to say that Carly um said that you'd never buy yourself anything so she was like here I bought you a ring because you never buy anything for yourself and I thought that would be like the latest proposal ever that was not how she proposed to me was it over some like freshwater cod or something like that but no we were uh we were at the gorgeous Beach of Lake Michigan at a kind of tucked away park that isn't visited too much so I think you're giving looks on the beach though you're given Lake Michigan too much credit our side of Lake Michigan is actually quite beautiful you just happen to live on the bad side of it oh okay are you gonna tell me that there's no freshwater cod in Lake Michigan I mean light I don't know anything about fish but we weren't like eating it didn't you do a whole like segment on Twitter about this particular fish that is popular in Grand Rapids well I mean there's a lot that's about what the city is Club but less oh yeah there's a lot of perch let's perch cod it's all the same thing what are we sorting him that's a show for yesterday we'll see it I like Zelda now oh good good I don't want to dwell too long on Zelda but how how far are you is there less uline shrine number oh you beat it I've done 90 91 92 shrines something like that alright out of 120 120 how many did you get all nine hundred core exceeds oh heavens no I'm not a I'm not gonna torture myself I know you do get something you get something apparently quote unquote cool when you get all nine hundred I don't know what it is Oh how would a person that feasibly do that without using the Internet I mean like that has to be the only way right or I guess you know when you open you look at the map there's something everywhere so you could look at pockets of nothingness on the map and go there's probably a core exceed there that would take so long although I kind of did that with Skyrim when I went on my quest to find every location on the map without using the Internet and I did well let me this is this is a show about Pokemon who would have guessed millet let me lay out the show here we're going to be recapping some news on Zelda and then we got some emails about that and then we're going to do our zelda of the week so know we got some Pokemon news with some update to Sun and Moon Pokemon go stuff then we have some emails and then Travis is back for our Pokemon of the week which will be vanilluxe this week and that will be our show for you guys so let's kick that off with some Pokemon news first bit of news here is Magikarp jump was released in Italy also known as splash Magikarp I think it was it's known in Japan but apparently not out in Japan the freemium this is off bubble pedia the freemium mobile game Pokemon Magikarp jump is now available ah for iOS in Italy after being announced in Japan in February the game is currently not available for Android although the game has been localized from japanese to english french spanish korean and chinese it is currently not available in these language the release of the game has not officially been promoted although I do think the Italian Pokemon Twitter account did tweet about it a day or two ago so why Italy first who knows we got a lot of Magikarp over there is a lot of water maybe somebody water running the Italian App Store accidentally hit the publish button and then they just had to roll with it yeah right they just had like it makes no sense that even 24 hours after the Italian release it didn't show up anywhere else and now it's been 5 days 6 days since it's been out and still nothing yeah like I don't have any theories for you it's strange it looks cool yeah I am I looked in the app store this morning and it wasn't there so confirmed it's not there yeah my only guess is is somebody else will be getting it this week I can't imagine Italy is just gonna have it early for like a month straight next the Vatican's gonna get it I will report more on that on that game wanna know anything about it like what it is yes okay so it's based off a another mobile game called survive mole mola mola I I don't know what that means well that's what the what that's what the other game is and that exists in the Google Play Store wait and in iTunes Inc I I think I played that it it has according to their description it has five million downloads I think I played this I mean briefly because at this point I was using a terrible phone for um that is like a phone that you should give someone like as a punishment so it didn't run very well but Carly really wanted me to play cuz she was playing at the time you play as like a fish I don't even remember what yeah do you but I think you have like stats that increase or something yeah weird like that some things that are like really silly and you have to get bigger and bigger this is what I'm seeing from the internet yeah yeah that game I was thinking of yeah it's I mean like you go to if you want to know what Magikarp jump splash Magikarp if you want to know what that game is you can its it survive exclamation mark mola mola mo la mo la two words but it's free in iTunes it was last updated may 17 2007 teen correct and it has in-app purchases wow yeah splash Magikarp does too oh I like how the description doesn't actually describe the game itself though I mean it kind of does if you look at the little pictures that basically the mola mola is very frail oh here we go here we got how to play don't let your mola die grow your mola to the world's biggest 2.5 T class how to play number one eat ocean creatures to gain weight all right sounds like a Saturday night number two test your luck and go on adventures to gain weight number three strengthen your mola and gain weight number four death is not the end start a new game molas get stronger when they die oh the what yeah they die a lot and then like you spend like the points I think gosh it's all blur but I think when you die then you get the points associated with whatever score you had based on how large you got and you can spend those points unlike abilities for your future molas oh so it's like trim okay now I'm starting to understand I went to download mola mola and if we don't get Magikarp splash within the next week I'll at least have something to report on here cool second bit of news is Pokemon Sun and Moon version 1.2 patch is now available a patch for Pokemon Sun and Moon brings the verge brings the game up from version 1.1 to 1.2 this patch fixes a large number of bugs battle video save prior to the update cannot be played or shared it fixes the following a glitch involving spikey shield and sky drop that caused the user of sky drop unable to move or switch out if it faints due to the damage from spikey shield number 2 a glitch that caused all activities in pokey pella go to complete if the date was changed to a new month I don't know if that's a glitch that's more of just people changing the date yeah ah number three a glitch that caused a game to crash if the player used in evolution item with that item being the last item in their bag number four a glitch that sometimes prevented scatterbug from learning egg moves number five a glitch that allowed eggs to be given items under services some circumstances that's I don't know that's not a glitch that seems pretty sweet if I have a focus band let me put it around the egg I don't see any problems with that one and the last one a glitch ending the tournament when pre-registered for an online friendly competition EG entry gets canceled or the battle team gets unlocked so you want to talk about glitches I got a vanillish egg vanillite egg from one of my friends yesterday and he has all of his Pokemon in beast balls and literally the egg came over in a beast ball and I was like oh you gotta give it away the spoiler there folks ahaha but yeah also the important thing is you lost all your battle videos - you can't view your old battle videos after you do the update that's clearly sad I haven't experienced any of those glitches I don't know if you guys have nah they're pretty niche right like I can't imagine using an evolution item when I don't have anything else in my bag I'm I'm not like breeding an epic for an epic vivillon sweep like vivillon sorry if my French pronunciation is incorrect yeah like so like scatterbug isn't gonna be too relevant to me so I I have not personally you know update your games if you haven't there's also the we reported on this last week but the like on rock is still available at your game stops until June 15th I think the day is I don't have it up in front of me but I'm pretty sure it's it's June 15th or sometime into June some more news here is Pokemon go now has an official Instagram app sorry Instagram account I'm giving you guys breaking news here oh I mean I saw that on my Twitter feed and I was continued to not be excited at all I do not have an Instagram account so there'd be no reason for me to have wow you gotta get with it you're you take you take the photos Travis yeah but I don't correct I don't know if you know this but Instagram is only for photos and spam accounts but for photos really I understand that but I just don't I don't like it all right so yeah I mean I'm surprised cuz you know Tom from MySpace actually gives like his photo his photos are amazing and he's yeah and he's on in the Instagram and you kill he actually like gives little mini lessons on how to take good photos on Instagram Tom promise' can you think any you think I need tips from myspace tom myspace top from myspace top from myspace has a lot of money probably the world's most expensive camera and goes to the most exotic places because of said money well okay so you obviously haven't been watching his lessons because he doesn't have the world's most expensive camera oh really a Julius of what camera he has oh oh yeah now he one of the ones he went through he's like no you don't need a really expensive camera you just need like these particular kinds of the receptor like the ISO level of the acceptor and everything but what he does have is that money so he can travel all around the world to all the fantastic places and also enough money to pay like other people to just go away so he can have his pictures all on his home he's proudly using like an iPhone 3GS or something lighting it up an inner Nikon I'm working on a personal portfolio anyway it's just posted on my own portfolio so um I'm doing things I'm pretty picky about who I follow on Instagram now I used to follow like everyone like oh you're your Twitter friend your Facebook friend I'm just gonna follow you but now I have eliminated it to just people who are taking good photos like I don't need a photo of your dinner but if you're like my ones don't follow my fiance why are you following me cuz all I do is take pictures of my pets and my food yeah they're not the greatest yeah no there's a there's a couple exceptions but for the most part I do want my Instagram feed to be nothing but like photos I go oh yeah that looks good ah yeah that's a good shot if I go why is the sentence why is this picture worthy then you're probably going to get an unfollow unless your name is will and I'll probably keep you well some those shiny pokemon I was taking pictures of that was pretty cool I remember all your bugs no that's that's that's unfollow worthy you know what I don't want to see my Instagram feed bugs but it was it lit it legitimately was an off-colored cicada because the cicadas are usually black and that one was like light green it was a little edge it emit real life shiny my Instagram is watching the sink if anybody wants to follow okay I handle comment below shares of bugs at least your cat's not eating them my cats eat bugs ever now then no my dog is like literally eating all of them as we walk down the street she's scooping them up like this popcorn time at the movie theater speaking of Pokemon go they have an Instagram account but there is also a new special event going on right now this is off business insider Pokemon go creator Niantic labs is currently throwing an in-game celebration dubbed adventure week with R with reward and rewards players with a handful of bonuses one of those bonuses include spawning certain rock-type pokémon including rare creatures like Aerodactyl I pulled this article off Business Insider because they have a spawn chart from reddit user solid ah anyway sure that's exactly how it's supposed to be son yep uh it just shows which Pokemon are actually spawning for this event so it's sudowoodo Geodude gravel or golem onyx oma night our lord helix omastar butoh Kabutops Aerodactyl larvae thar pupil thar Tyranitar Rhyhorn ride on chuckle mcCargo and corsola also slugma is definitely also spawning this chart is missing slugma were you doing the pokerap no but uh the other benefits of here is okay so this event will also goes to May 25th are the last event what was the last of it was a grass I believe it was pretty sure was grass it was like three days long this event was a full week buddy Pokemon only need to walk one quarter of the normal distance to find candy so we'll collect at every three kilometers more items will be collected from each poke stop there is also a new adventure hat available for all trainers to wear in the game that hat does not cost any money and select Maya's fire type only which is why it's not on the list oh yeah that's right but it does it is spotting way more frequently because I've never saw a slugma until this event started and now I'm seeing hundreds of them you guys been playing are you on an adventure rock over here eventually I haven't had the opportunity but um I mean you've got your your Apple watch is now performing adequately for performing pokemon go activities yeah you told me yeah so I was at the mall yesterday Irene wanted to go shopping together which was involved her going shopping and me just walking around the mall in a circle collecting polka stops very been in this situation with you before it was a very good bonding experience right where we were we were still not together but at least we're at the same we're the same building I tried the pokey I tried the watch the Apple watch because I had nothing but problems problems with it and so I turned it on it lasted for about fourteen seconds and it crashed and then I did my this is garbage I'm very disappointed and then I did it again and it worked just fine I was able to I did a 34 minute walk I think throughout the mall I counted my steps to count at the time it showed me which Pokemon are in the area when I looked at the watch when I opened or closed the Pokemon Go app it didn't interfere with the watch at all it was nice because I was able to get my steps I was able to hatch eggs but also check Twitter at the same time and then at the end it like built a little workout and then put it into my Apple health kit of like this is how many steps you took and this was really go 35 minute walk exercise quote-unquote till those little activity bars I was very happy with it maybe I'll come I'm considered starting walking to work so I might start Pokemon going as I walk to work well you all walk for you ah to work is to miles oh that's not bad oh yeah the only reason I don't do it is because I have to like get places during the day but I'm trying to do a an economic analysis of whether it is less expensive to either pay for the parking at work which is not cheap at all or to take a app-based ride-sharing service at the times when I actually need to take a car someplace during the day and alright I'll be I'll be over here crunching the numbers for yeah I got the spreadsheets out you I've got those those old calculators that like print out the result instead of just displaying it yeah I got I got I'm rocking some abacuses Abuk I do you have one of those green plastic cat brim hats yeah my countin swear will I was envisioning that exact I didn't say it but I was envisioning that exact green visor yep there you go are like TI 87 I don't know what the number is 89 s are those so thing I think they're 84 right or TI 82 TI 80 84 carta our kids are kids still using those are they just using their iPhones because I feel like an iPhone is way more powerful I don't think it has other graphing calculator applications there has to be I mean probably yes ti-84 um yeah all the kids who can afford iPhones sure I'm yeah yeah Adam worth later ain't cheap there was that you know when I was in high school yeah that's like a lot of money yeah and I'm I'm I I would I would imagine that most kids have an Android or an iPhone or look if you yet so even if you say iPhones aren't cheap whether or not you qualify for an upgrade or not Android phones are pretty cheap and I would assume that the google play store isn't restrictive of apps I would assume that the cheapest Android smartphone is probably still more powerful then a ti-84 yeah but you don't get blocked dude is the thing or Dino puzzle or whatever the other games were on there I mean of course I was like a snake clone or whatever but I'm blocked dude but also is that the trade-off for the smartphone is you have to have a mobile service plan with a ti-84 you have a calculator and you're done I want is there is the right I want a study of like how many kids in school don't have a smartphone or don't have a phone at all I promise you plenty if phones are expensive not if you just get like a flip phone for your kid it's like a $9.99 a month out of that get out of that upper-class liberal bubble you live in exactly down here to the real world the hardcore City of Milwaukee as as I'm talking to you on an expensive microphone pairing my giant desktop computer to my iPhone to be able to time to be able to talk to you on this motor talk about Oh adventure week adventure whoo yeah whatever so I played I was at the mall probably for an hour and a half started my mall journey at like 96 percent on my iphone ended my mall journey in that hour and a half at like two percent on my iPhone I forgot how playing Pokemon go non-stop destroys your battery but I cut a lot of Geodude and my Pikachu got enough candy to get a ride too so I finally have a ride shoe and I got the I got the more cargo I got a bunch of Rhyhorn zai got two larvae tarz I've I'm in Kabuto City nothing but Kabuto everywhere hopefully by the end of the week I'll have a golem I'm at like 80 candy for golem or to get a golem so I'm very satisfied with with this event I also believe pokeballs are on sale even though I wouldn't buy pokeballs just because if I can go to the mall and hit like five stops every five minutes and and that's fine but I'm pretty sure pokeballs are on sale for those that don't have a lot of stops buy them they're 50% off so it's 50 coins for 20 balls instead of 100 coins for 20 balls and so on and so forth but I think the last event the grass week it was too short and I don't think it's spawned grass pokemon as frequently as other events did in the past and how this event is doing currently if Pokemon go if Niantic is doing this like this one-week event once a month I think that's more than enough to keep people playing but didn't they ever ties that there was going to be some special secret Pokemon as part of this event I don't think I ever saw that I think I saw that on the news or heard it on the news cuz I can't watch news anymore because you convinced me to get rid of cable and I'll never forgive you for that ah save any money money inside of money yes speaking of the mall squirtle is the next Pokemon headed to build-a-bear workshop this article is off polygons build-a-bear workshops Pokemon collection is expanding once more squirtle the second best member of the original starters that's enough pinion movies written by a previous guest on it's super effective Allegra Frank yeah well he sins she is in some deep water now I'm calling you out Allegra elect you once on this program where we have some fighting words now actually squirtle is pretty great no one's debating yeah the best one not second but we'll deal why that's why there's a problem here oh the problem is she says second best but she doesn't say what number what her number one is I'm assuming it's a it's Charmander aerobics Bulbasaur oh that's not true oh you're going to get us in so much trouble there are people who love Bulbasaur they are not me but Bulbasaur is enjoyed by many people oh let's be let's be frank myself nobody liked my let's be allegra frank my saying no one likes Bulbasaur will get me in trouble with fewer people than if I had said no one likes Charmander or no one like squirrel that's then you'd be in a heat of trouble correct squirtle endpoint is proven squirtle look come in two separate sets the online only package includes a pre stuffed plush a sound chip filled with squirtle sounds a raincoat a hoodie inspired by an ultra ball annex and an exclusive pokemon card this bundle will cost $60 on build-a-bears website the raincoat and sound chip are only included with the web exclusive and the raincoat is pretty cute oh it's okay it's it's I kinda see through and it's a bunch of red palazzi cute it's really cute stuffed Pokemon fans who want to build their own squirtle can do so at the any of the workshop locations beginning in June wrong as a way yes she does she actually right stuffed Pokemon fans which is like the appropriate sentence would be like fans of stuffed Pokemon that's true not like the fans themselves are stuff don't usually just give you dinner you do stuff your your your your animals at build-a-bear you do this ya know but but but the term stuffed Pokemon fans dance it you could say I'm a Pokemon podcast fan but that doesn't mean I'm a podcast fan who is a Pokemon it just means I'm happy ah the great program it's a anyways what were you gonna say why should why is she wrong she says the unimaginable to bear they had a met Mayfair they had him at my mall I didn't walk in to build-a-bear I probably would have walked in if Irene was with me but I didn't want to walk Nadia how do you know it wasn't just like a display that was like a was it did you actually see the it was actually it was it was like squirt was like this the squirtle was like Center on a display in the store it could have been saying it could have been coming up he's walking in to build-a-bear on your own a threat to your masculinity no I've done it before but if I could hear you at this time here's my worry I would have walked in solo and I would have bought the squirtle and then Irene would have been mad at me that she wasn't with me when we stuffed said squirtle together and so ice is reasonable so I thought to myself if I'd if I just don't go in then there will be no stuffing to be had these squirrels will come with a special pokemon card they will cost $28 for the squirtle that of course is including any of the overpriced accessories squirtle is the fourth pokemon to be available at build-a-bear workshop Pikachu Eevee and our personal favorite Charmander so that that's her number one right there we eager we eagerly await Bulbasaur build-a-bear workshop to round out the collection not gonna happen yeah it can be what well Bulbasaur is on four legs well so is Evie though and they don't but it are bears like now but but the stumpy shape and roundness of the Bulbasaur they it's just a you it does not fit the bill to be what about what you know what else is round up like a teddy bear it's in their wheelhouse nothing with the likes of flower on the back you can't blow the stuffing in and inflate that the same way you can something that does not have an ornamental no there I don't know that how the technology of stuffin works Build A Bear build-a-bear have you built I think the scientists over at the build-a-bear corporation can figure it out if they can figure out how to like uh like they they they cracked the code on the on the My Little Ponies they've cracked the code on a variety of animals and fun creatures and they frag the code on a number of Pokemon before and I think I think Bulbasaur is not even a challenge for the great minds at the build-a-bear workshop frankly well they do have a Brachiosaurus but I would say I look at their build the bear stuffed Groot and then ask yourself again whether this is something you really want I refuse to because this is an audio program and I won't be participating in this thing that the two of you keep doing by commenting on the like rain jacket of this squirtle that I that I can't see the sinners can't see I'm not I'm not it's really cute and actually if I could get one in Travis size I would buy it and send it to you what is what is Travis I owe is it like a is it a clothing I don't like a small or an extra small or a jacket it's the rain jacket bear no I thought you were saying I thought you're saying like a Groot I thought you were talking about the Groot still Oh get the Groot and Travis sighs no I said whatever you guys missing my nerds haha last bit of news here before we take a break I asked a question on Twitter I think we're gonna ask question once a week so we have something to go off of last week I asked if people were still playing Pokemon Sun and Moon we talked about that during the interview with Joe from Sarah B this week I asked if people were people were playing the Pokemon mobile games and which one they were playing the most choices between Pokemon shuffle Pokemon go and Pokemon dual figured I'd leave this up because I thought splash Magikarp was coming but I was wrong their results though are 16% of people prefer Pokemon shuffle 10% of people prefer Pokemon duel and a whopping 74% of people in prefer Pokemon go yeah and this just in water is wet like what Wow oh that's so harsh I'm kidding I'm sorry Steve it's a very good pool and you did a great job thank you thank you I did a great job you taking advantage of Twitter's API right I would assume that the people who like Pokemon shuffle and Pokemon duel more just don't go out of the house right that has to be the reason or they live in a place that's very very cold or they live in a place I guess I guess is still the same or they live in um the same thing or they just live in the middle of nowhere so even if they wanted to go somewhere there's still no poke stops right Pokemon shuffles really good I have yet to play pokemon duel it's alright no Fire Emblem right you still playing Fire Emblem of course that good Fire Emblem just came out yeah but it's not really it's on 3ds so it's not about an iOS or Android correct isn't there gonna be a switch one probably yeah they announced one for switch oh no the real news is the not the honeydew the Harvest Moon for switch not as distance teller dudes system seller now start do valleys already announced on switch yeah so you've already got it yeah so why would you buy a less superior game all right with that sigh what we're going to do is we're going to take a quick break and when we come back we will tackle some emails and our Pokemon of the week Putterman fun to make and we are back from our break gonna tackle some emails here if you have any questions comments or concerns you can send us an email at SBJ at PKM and cast dot-com or you can go over to pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button both will get to the same place first email here is from will from Knoxville Tennessee hey Pokemon masters and SBJ I hope every uh I like the implication of that that you aren't included within pokey masters I feel like I play pokemon more than both of you combined that's probably great I mean well Emily not true I mean it's not true of me lately cuz I'm playing very much my go play time is still Pokemon and I already go uh a whole lot but I play Pokemon moon like every day how long every day though like an hour Oh probably about an hour yeah alright it's like that's seven hours a week well but more on the weekends and especially because I've been finishing up my I'm I'm like six pokemon away from finishing my lowland pokedex gonna link that sucker up to Pokemon bank bang gonna get the super shiny charm everything like that make a special team for Pokemon Sun and then it's gonna be even more hours I'm gonna play pokemon Sun fresh clean and the way I want to play it what about what about what about the hot ma are you are you watching no because my friend Steve convinced me that not having cable anymore and saving all that money was gonna be a great choice and guess what I don't have cable anymore so no Disney XD for me and no no before you say I'm not paying $40 a month for PlayStation views so 30 days ago 30 it was 40 the last time I checked what is it like 38 95 no it's $29.99 I'll become sure if youdon't review just wanted Pokemon there would be a slightly cheaper way to do it like on iTunes or something nope hmm no it's like 30 dollars for like 12 episodes I'm not well it's the new one uh yeah like you can buy the season pass really okay I might actually do that huh nope no because the new ones really really good so I don't know it's not a good yeah I thought it was very kiddush you know but it's it's strange I had literally have people texting me and they're like they they're like oh I thought it was gonna be stupid but I'm all like sucked into it now that's that came from Zach from North Carolina if anybody is curious um so I mean out I'll take that dudes word for it I trust him alright I mean kiddush sure like it's it's a kids show and this iteration of it I think is doubling down on that but you can be a good kids show as I think this is shaping up to be there's a lot of funny jokes in it yeah but Pokemon has never been a good kids show it's always been a and now it and now it's approaching that way so get in whoa slow average yeah alright I ran you guys don't have this wait let me just and let me give you the informed viewpoint here the with the new direction that they're taking they have actually turned the show or brought the show closer to modern anime sort of drawing and sort of expressive features that are that you see in the the actual anime that you get from Japan as opposed to a highly westernized more trying to be Cartoon Network cartoon type thing I don't reject animation or how it looks has anything to do with the quality of the loot Leo does no absolutely it does absolutely not like I could watch a hot ma from 1980 and it could be poorly drawn but if it had a compelling enough story and it wasn't the same thing of Asch discovers a new pokemon team rocket shows up and something and tries to steal that pokemon they blast Team Rocket off Ashe refuses to catch said new pokemon and continues on with his journey every single episode yeah what that not I want not what I'm saying what I'm saying it is everything I said right there has nothing to do with the animation you can change it could be the best animated Pokemon show of the world but if it still has those four bullet points which it's had for 21 years I'm not interested well that's not true either but you can't divorce the animation style from the the the whole core of evaluating what the quality of the anime is and now you've completely made me forget what oh yeah buzz I'm just saying it's better because it's become more artistic in and more towards modern preferences in animation in the actual world of anime the what I would what I would say is that the way that television medium works and specifically the way the animated medium works is that atmosphere or the tone of the show is a result of both the writing and the animation right so the writing calls for the animators to create images of certain physical jokes or like you know physical comedy of things bunking into each other or or whatever and then the animation iterates on that it creates an iteration of it and then that informs further writing once the style has been nailed down by the animation then the writing doubles down on that style and it creates a sort of synergistic loop that the the function of which is sort of that the tone of the show so I think I'm with will here that it's difficult to disentangle those two elements from one another I have only so I saw the first two episodes and then I saw episode 3 an episode 3 fits the same exact medium the same exact flow as the last 20 years which was ashen company disco from me McHugh team rocket shows up make you hate speak at you because that's its gimmick team rocket blasts off again ash does not catch mimic you end of episode exactly i honest mimic you is really hard to catch no but it's regardless that is the same thing that has happened for the last 21 years every episode they introduce a new pokemon and every episode Team Rocket interviewers and every episode ash doesn't catch that new Pokemon but you're not the target audience for this right like children are and children like to see stories where they can expect what's gonna happen yeah actually joy but yeah you know it is incredibly true watch any episode of Power Rangers every single episode of that show is precisely the same except for the few times that they get into the Megazord or whatever it's called and they're not able to defeat the giant monster and then they need some other superpower from space or whatever that comes and it gives them that additional power to defeat the giant monster other than those few instances every episode of the Power Rangers is there are some minions that they fight outside of the suit then they go into the suit and there's a monster and they beat it off but then it gets giant and then they can't fight it in their suits so then yeah have you ever seen another set of Power Rangers that they always wear in the monsters like said I know exactly what you're saying s what is a and you wanna keep going okay counterpoint what did you Digimon does not have that same flow and Digimon was definitely more human absolutely has that sound for you kidding me no it does not mati will go on and then where we get into some other world and like it's too overwhelming for me and my character and my Digimon Digimon to something bigger to help us we're getting we're getting too far we're getting too from not far from the point the point is it doesn't matter whether or not this is every single children's program what matters is that this is an established thing that as that is successful and it does work and children like they'd like to see repetition in story that that's a tactic that Pokemon has chosen to employ and throughout its history and I don't think necessarily that just because that style of storytelling doesn't appeal to you specifically I don't think that necessarily means that your claim is warranted that I mean that it's a bad show for that I think it just means that you don't want to see that and that's like okay but I don't think that is any I don't think that says anything poorly about Pokemon or what it does because it does what it does well and that's kind of all I personally ask of media is if it's if it sets out a goal that is admirable and then Chiefs that goal then like good it great perfect two more examples is Steven universe doesn't follow that and myelin Steven universe is not for children okay sure plenty of kids love Steven universe well they're wrong you can't you can't like I said like I said my point is go ahead the point isn't that the point I'm trying to make is not that every children's program does this but that a lot of them do and a lot of children like those programs that do do it it's an established method of storytelling whether or not to us adult it seems repetitive is sort of irrelevant because we're not the target audience for that I think it is still possible for us to watch it and say sure it's repetitive but then again I'm not I'm not the target audience for this and I think if I were the target audience I would probably enjoy this my point is I'm sick of every single year that that everyone keeps telling me that oh the Pokemon anime gets so much better every single year I hear that oh it's better than last year it's better than last year and then I go does it follow the same format that it does year after year well yeah but it's still better no that's not better it's just the same I think I am in they're all sick with 20 years of team rocket and and ash encountering one new Pokemon in episode and not actually doing anything worthwhile with that with that instance there are an infinite amount of ways in which something can improve that have nothing to do with see aureate the stuff yeah the plotline why am i watching if there's no suppose you enjoy the battle scenes because you enjoy the the animation style because you enjoy the particular blend of character ages at this time because you think Cylons really cool and his you know love of collecting stamps Euler stylish is not cool silent is awesome so whatever the best parts of the anime is when Ash is at a tournament and does battles after battles and even those even those like even an XYZ that tournament was really lackluster compared to tournaments in the past if all that truly mattered was the storyline no one would ever do anything other than read books but surprised it's not true at all there's so many shows that are storyline based cartoon or not yes correct but if it were the case that people only wanted storyline there would be no reason to have any visual element no no production company would waste the amount of money it takes to make a movie or a TV show if all people wanted to do was see a plot progress because then everyone would just buy books but they don't they want to see fascinating spectacle portrayed on screen in addition married to and being and interacting with story so I think it's kind of bizarre that the major claim is that your claim is nothing but the story matters that is why I just I just thought of a great parallel right scooby-doo literally did the same thing week after we and and so you answer you got and so did Power Rangers like we've established that and you know what I read or what I don't watch Scooby Doo okay so we what we've established is you're the one with the problem and the rest of the world is fine yes you are right I am the only single person that hates the Pokemon anime minus the frequent amount of listeners that tell us not to talk about anime because it's boring or the other half the spectrum that one is to talk about more anime because they're interested but what is there to talk about Oh what was the Pokemon this week mimic you Oh what happened well you know team rocky got involved like they have for the last 21 years okay where where's the talking points on that the indo-iranian with listeners interesting way in which beware come out of nowhere to uh to save Team Rocket I mean I would I would enjoy a segment of this program where it's just someone telling me how be where did a funny thing in rescuing Team Rocket this week that would bring me endless joy remember when everyone loved Pokemon organs huh I wonder why oh because it actually told the story you know what doesn't tell an actual story the anime you know what else other people loved that youtube series do you know why because it wasn't the same thing each one of those episodes told a story right but the the reason more people we know like those things is because those are targeted for people that whose ages are closer to our ages okay so then why are why are you guys saying that the anime is better when it's the same thing and when it's not it's not it's better at already in the history of the anime it has made a progression and that progression is an improvement at the program is if the progression is only like the art style like that's still not a progression it just means they hired a different team I mean like I really disagree with with that claim right there that a that in an improvement in like improvements in areas other than storyline like those matter to me like I'm fine conceding that the storyline itself is cyclical the same sure I'm fine conceding that I I just happen to appreciate improvements in other areas and if overall like most of the areas of the that you could discuss about the anime have improved that I'm going to say that the anime has improved look I know that the anime is nothing but a commercial for Pokemon it's nothing but to sell games to sell trading cards to sell merchandise that's all it exists for I get I do not I do not disagree all I'm asking is for when somebody says the anime is better than it was last year is for me to watch it and go oh look it they finally broke the formula they've stuck to but better doesn't necessarily mean broke the formula like when someone says you know anime ever gotten satisfied yeah when someone says the anime is better don't expect it to be different like a completely different show look at me that's not better like I want well I want that's what we're discovering here right now is that your your your standards are quite different than are the people who are telling you the anime is better you are looking for very different things than they are I would I would also argue that like the the first season had somewhat of I look forward to next week and I would even argue that the orange island season had something where it was like I look forward to next week it for me it is hard to watch XYZ black and white black and white to whatever because I've seen almost all those episodes and I even put on a random episode of diamond and pearl like two weeks ago and that's when we discovered the Bidoof fiasco I just find it frustrating that when I finish any of those episodes whether it's black and white XY alala that it doesn't feel like they're setting up to the viewer there's no like cliffhanger there's no getting excited for next week I will agree with you that given the standards that you have laid out like given your standards if you want to see different stories told you want to have something that that pulls you towards wanting to watch another episode if those are your standards the Pokemon anime is terrible but those are not the standards to which the Pokemon anime is playing so I'm going to look at the essentially the criteria by which the Pokemon anime judges itself and and try to judge it by that criteria and if I see that it's improving in those criteria I'll say that it's improving and when people do the same I just don't think you should expect that the anime has specifically catered itself to you Steve black jr. it's what matters the most is when they cater to me perfect but this is why we hit this is why we have bad anime is because everyone's just so complacent with it oh that's all I've done it for 21 years who cares if they keep doing it like no it's been around for 20 years probably now is the time to change it I would venture to say that the new anime is not bad there are a lot of points in which the anime has been bad but I enjoy myself watching the new anime I laugh a lot more than I have in previous seasons I find myself in drawing the spectacles portrayed on screen ways that I haven't in other seasons and I find myself enjoying more of the characters than I have in previous seasons to me that is a market improvement to something that is not a bad anime and don't we all just need more laughter in this day and age no that's why people listen to the show yeah that's why we that's why we are that's why we got legitimately angry at each other in the last 20 minutes I will continue watching the Aloha series I think they're on what episode for now so I'm one episode behind maybe episode 5 I can't remember but I've been watching the sub so I don't know where we are I think Disney XD is on episode 4 or 5 I'll continue watching it but it's the same thing yeah but just if you if you continue to watch it don't expect it to be different just try and enjoy the jokes enjoy the colors enjoy the Q Pokemon and enjoy the people don't expect it to I feel like everything I said would fit perfectly if you were pitching that to will III sold take my $12 Apple I'm what I am in what I'm saying like what I'm saying is the Pokemon anime is not geared towards the set of standards that you have towards the Pokemon anime so you might consider adjusting your expectations there's a lot of anime out there I don't know what that means and yeah just ignore that I only got time for so much in my life our boys is the best anime of the year which one don't it's it's a there's a polygon youtube series called car boys that eventually kind of just evolved into an anime and I love it it's not anime at all but it's really good yeah I mean watching blue exorcist so do you recommend from Will Anderson right there did you love you infidelity Steve no I have it yet oh you have to watch it then we have to talk about it off the show all right good I will I'll probably watch it on Monday when I'm at work and not actually working let's actually get to wills question now that we got the anime off the table so this is will from Knoxville Tennessee hey Pokemon masters in spj I hope everyone is I hope everyone's day is going great so far it was up until about 10 minutes ago well as I'm far away from my mic and I still max it out I'm sorry Steve will is my favorite but I really love all you people I forgot what episode but spj said something of well here we go as I said something but actually takes it something really ignorant so let me explain look I am sure there's plenty of people who agree with me on the anime front I would argue that most of our listeners don't watch the anime for the reason for the same reasons I I do I think you're certainly correct on the point that people agree with you I think you're correct on the point the majority of our listeners don't watch the anime but I would say that if someone has the same opinion of you regardless of whether or not they're in the majority they are incorrect I would I would not say that I would say that people like to get daniel's question please know we're now we got to go off the rails before we get to well I will just say fun let's just look at that I have high standards for what I want my Pokemon anime are not anime I forgot what episode spj said something about how mid-tier Pokemon don't get any love I think Wartortle was an example I hate that these Pokemon get overlooked so often I was thinking why don't they give a middle evolution a mega form give me a mega Metapod give me a mega Selo do you have any other ideas on how the middle evolution tiers can get get hype and used in the games because Evo light clearly is not doing that Evo light is clearly not doing that thanks for all the hard work will for maxvill tennessee i mean eat the light is doing alright right like porygon - is one of the most important pokemon in the meta and that's because of evo light so I mean porygon to its usage way more than port Aegon Z so to some extent heavy lights doing its job but it only does its job for Pokemon that are already have the stat and move cool to be bulky walls so you only get stuff like Chansey porygon to using it generally oh I I don't I don't know that you're really going to I don't know that any like real solution to this is going to be satisfying because even if you go to the port again to example now it's just like ok porygon - is the one that's better than porygon z so now it's just oh ok so for that line it's just everyone cares about this one and not that one so it the way pokemon works is like one pokemon in a line is going to be better than all the others and that's the one that gets usage with the exception of pokemon with split evolutions and I'm not going to cry too many tears for all of you know all of the like quilladin 'z of the world that aren't getting used like it's kind of just the nature the way the game is structured to me well so you've got to understand what the purpose of the middle evolutions are and I would say that their purpose is when you are playing the story right their purpose is not for competitive their purpose is so that when you're playing the story it maintains your interest as you're at the midpoint of the story that you're not just using that first evolution for 30 or 40 levels it's like you hit level 20 you hit level 25 oh hey I've got a new Pokemon to keep me going for a little while longer you know and so you got that interest it's something you're working through as part of the story um and I think that's literally their only purpose that they're they're not intended to be competitive they're not intended to be an end game type Pokemon and they just sort of are in there to carry you through so that you have something different to work with as you keep going through the story that's why I actually feel like in later generations there's been fewer of them just because people rush through the story so fast they don't need that midpoint to sort of maintain interest and say what am I going to have in the middle all right and then what am I going to have at the end it's kind of like well I'm already working towards an endgame Pokemon I don't really care about what comes before it anymore I hadn't thought about that trend I'd be interested to do you know for a fact that that's the case that they have fewer middle evolutions now than they did in previous generations well in all the time I just spent you bleeding by you know an intimate latex is very anecdotal but they you know literally towards the end of the Pokedex they're the only triple evolution is vanillite to vanilluxe but you know you have to think like the majority of the ones towards the end there even are like snubbull to granbull gastro Don but actually but you can't even get those yet to breed those - there's a new Pokemon though basics I would I would those aren't new Pokemon though like you're in so if you're gonna say that I who has three evolutions besides picky Peck via volt all right that's another one but okay so these are your carry through the story ones but are you getting tons and tons of triple evolution ones or are sort of you is the glut of the Pokedex mostly two evolutions at most we'll have to do a scientific study of this and get back to it I mean I would say that not all Pokemon are built to be competitive like look at something like corsola like definitely not going to see any competitive action if Pokemon wanted to honor middle evolutions they could do a tournament unofficial tournament where you could only use middle evolutions I feel like they feel like they might have done something like that in the past I know in the TCG they had the tournament where you could only use cards that could evolve into something you could never do final evolutions yeah maybe a bound sweet by the way also has three evolutions the other thing they could do is just make more items like Evo Lite just make them do different things and only apply to non fully evolved Pokemon I don't know what whatever are the rules for evo light if it evolves if it has the capability to evolve its defense and special defense increase by a factor of I believe 1.5 times yeah yeah if you're holding if you light a visa yes those are the same thing if it evolves you know double if it valves but you haven't evolved it double at speed Jang mo o also has three evolutions or two more however you want to say that I an Eevee light for speed would be very interesting you'd get a lot of like I feel like that would get you a lot of like you would have murkrow with evo light because it gets prankster so you'd have a lot of these like support Pokemon but because I mean obviously they they're offensive stats are probably not gonna be as good as their evolved form but maybe their ability or move pool is supportive of some sort of support set that'd be interesting or I guess you wouldn't it with murkrow no Who am I kidding it RDS prankster stop listening to me no one should listen to me ever but great more items like that help without like changing Pokemon or or whatnot if you just introduced two more items that are similar to how Evo light acts I think that would help eleven golem also as three doodle olan olan going through the Pokedex in this is still not a scientific study here hey I'm just pointing out the threes because pika Peck and what whatever other one was the only ones we could think of ah next email is from Lindsey from Dallas Texas hello super effective cast I am a fairly new listener having found this podcast only a month ago and I'm really enjoying the LAT the few episodes I've listened to so far it's recounted my right now you have to be introduced to me it's rekindled my love for pokémon as I fell out of the loop not long after the beginning of generation two and has brought a memory back to me that I haven't thought of in years back when Pokemon was still new to the u.s. I had brought my Game Boy Color and my copy of Pokemon blue to school to play during our breaks between classes not realizing that I made another kid upset only days before and thus having them steal my gameboy and erase my file which would which normally wouldn't have been a big deal it just meant I got to play pokemon the game except it also erased my Mewtwo which at the time could only be attained by obtained through attending a tournament maybe ammu I feel like mute of MU because you could get Mewtwo in cerulean cave so getting the tape is that the cave yes then Mewtwo is in I think so yeah definitely mute but who knows needless to say this memory still saddens me knowing that I'll never get my Mewtwo back again my question for all of you is have you ever had a savefile loss or corrupted and lost a Pokemon you may never have gotten back Lindsey my answer is no in a manner of speaking yes the what I can't remember if it was my cartridge for silver or my cartridge for crystal I believe it was my sis I think it was the silver cartridge that I lost and never saw again and had a lot of Pokemon I cared about on it generation 2 you was the only generation for which I had every game I had gold silver and crystal and pretty much all of my favorite Pokemon were on whichever cartridge it was that I ended up losing so that was a bummer uh yeah kind of similar story to Travis I lost my copy of Pokemon blue well after I outgrown Pokemon but I had I had all the Pokemon I was the only game I got the little like trainer certificate for completing your pokedex uh and when I actually started caring about Pokemon again I went to look for it and I couldn't find it and I found my sister's copy of Pokemon red which should have been in the same place as my copy but yeah I have to this day I've never found my copy of blue not that it would matter because you can't transfer this Pokemon anyways uh it would just be nice to have the physical cartridge still since that's where at least it started for me um my sister Sara she had a copy of platinum that she like dropped in a puddle of water on like a table or something or like a spill happened and that damaged her cartridge so she lost all her Pokemon that way and that was kind of like that almost like ended her Pokemon career where she was like well I put all this work in this game and now it's all gone I guess I'm just gonna play something else yeah it's it's a bummer when stuff like that happens Richard writes in from Santa bar Santa Barbara California hi spj and crew I am playing through Omega Ruby right now and I have grown quite attached to my Lou noon which is my H M Mon who also gives me gifts through her ability and my Paris Peck Paris act that also knows Spore and fall swipe helps me fill out my pokedex this has got me wondering about non-combat uses for Pokemon in the main series game my question is do you all have any favorite utility Pokemon or utility Pokemon that you used have been come that you've used become attached to cheers Richard well I could say I have in Pokemon X&Y I have a vivillon that I was using for compound eyes and thief which if you guys aren't aware if there's a particular held item that wild Pokemon might have there holding it compound eyes raises the percentage chance that you will come across a wild Pokemon that's holding that item and then thief allows you your vivillon to take that item from them so that that item then becomes part of your inventory and I just enjoyed that mechanic so much that I really grew attached to that little vivillon there unfortunately in a Lola you have to do that with a Butterfree and I did it once and put the Butterfree back in the box I needed a metal coat I mean I would have the same answers as most people right I would say stuff like be barrel I think more interesting Act answer would be to say my Volcarona in generation 5 given that it had access to flame body and the ability to fly so that was before your Gen six isms in your talent flames so instead or maybe it was whatever the other one is magma whatever that makes eggs hatch faster but the ability to fly to a place where I could go straight for a long period of time to hatch an egg and then also have the ability that cuts egg hatching time in half and then having that both on the same Pokemon so I'm not taking up two slots for those abilities was right I don't have any HM Pokemon that I have grown attached to I was one of them seemed like your style yeah no I uh it's very excited when that that stuff went away in in southern Moon I do have a quick a side story because because they mentioned that they had a para sect with false swipe and Spore and that's what they used to catch pokemon irene another irene story here it's not as good as the dream simple story of last week if you if you made it through housecleaning and you were blessed with the Dreamsicle story uh not as good as that story but Irene has a smeargle with false wife and a couple other moves that would matter when you're chaining Pokemon SOS battling it's what it's called and she ran out of false swipes it didn't have anything to replenish the moves and she was panicking because she was SOS battling and she wanted to catch you finally got the Pokemon she wanted to catch she was so scared to knock it out she didn't have any fall swipes left and I said you know you could just throw the pokeball and she was like but I haven't done any damage to it it's like it still has full health and I look I sighed and I was like it it doesn't matter just don't hurt the pokeball and she just threw a regular poke ball and caught it instantly and then I just I was just like in the future just throw pokeballs don't even bother attacking it because that whole mechanic in the game is so broken yep last email I have here is from Mason from Tiffin Ohio I have never heard of that place Tiffin nah don't know it no all right writes hello Pokemon podcast this is my first time riding in I'm sure you've heard that many times before so whatever I write asking three questions should you have time for it by the way my favorite is the person who likes Pokemon so discuss that among yourselves hahahaha that's well we all we can all agree on that that's will yeah although I would say that I spend more time with Pokemon than will does oh good god good enough are us on the show so maybe it's me number one I've started doing research in order to get into competitive play but something something I've noticed on smog on whenever I'm trying to look up it sets for particular Pokemon I often see that Eevee spreads are towards the stats they already have an excess of ie arcanine has full 252 towards speed and attack why is this why not put them into stats that could use a boost already it would make them so much more balanced do you want to answer the question before I do the next two I can I can tackle this one yeah it might seem intuitive that you want to shore up a pokemons weaknesses in that sense it does make a lot of intuitive sense but when you're talking about the actual execution of those strategies you'll end up finding that what the ideal pokemon is not one that can do can be a jack-of-all-trades instead you want an ace of one specific thing you want to be able to have a Pokemon that is specifically capable of knocking out a specific threat so maybe your team has trouble with Ferrothorn so you want to make sure you have a Pokemon in it that has the the capability to take out Ferrothorn in one hit but to do so you'll need to invest all of your EVs in to attack and speed to make sure that you out speed the things are that are important and you're able to one-hit ko that Ferrothorn with whatever Pokemon you're using conversely if you're on the other side of that argument and you're the one running the Ferrothorn you want to make sure that your Ferrothorn because it's already a very defensive Pokemon you want to make sure that you are killed in one hit by the fewest things possible because Ferrothorn job is to sit there deal some damage with iron barbs maybe a rocky helmet if you're getting a super annoying and just sit there with leech seed so you want to you're not really interested in and making offensive attacks you just want to survive as long as possible so that you can whittle down your opponent's offenses so you wind up with an incentive to make the already offensive Pokemon more offensive so that they can deal with defensive Pokemon and you wind up with defensive Pokemon that are as defensive as possible to deal with the hyper offensive ones and surely of course there are exceptions to this but that's generally how the game ends up functioning if you were to have um a Pokemon say like Glalie before mega evolution was available as a pokemon that had 80 in each of its base stats so it's similar to the legendary Pokemon or mythical Pokemon I suppose like mu or Celebi that have 100 in each of its stats Glalie did not get used at all even though you would think sure eighty is not at a super high stat but at least it's balanced so it can do a lot of things well turns out if you can do a lot of things okay you might as well just pick a Pokemon who can do that thing you want it to do super well you you're always picking a Pokemon to fill a specific role and you're always going to end up picking a pokemon that excels at that one role over a Pokemon that is just okay at it does that make sense yes yeah I was going to say to simplify everything that you just said just ask yourself the question why make a mediocre Pokemon less mediocre why not take a great Pokemon and make it greater yeah there was one or you have it there was the white Travis said there's exceptions to that at the 2012 VGC Nationals there was a sub striker with a very weird Eevee spread that allowed it to survive stuff but also like it survived almost every thing it was weak to but it was also still fast enough where it out sped everything and I don't know what that exact Eevee spread was but like Mason VGC VGC is a wild world right because if VGC is you've got weird stuff like trick room and you've got oddities like I mean the fact that you're dealing with two Pokemon on each side mean things tend to be bulkier generally at least in certain versions of the GC meta game so like the GC you'll end up with just out of this world Eevee spreads and weird stuff like before the meta really settles down you'll have this weird speed creep thing where like a Pokemon if like early in the meta oh well and marowak was used like all the time and it's still an important Pokemon um but I think it got more usage early than it does now and before people really figured out what Eevee spread to use on it it would be like people would give it a lot of bulk but then like a tiny bit of speed so out speed other low and marowak and then people would be like well if people are putting four V's in speed I'm gonna put in eight and then people I'm gonna put in twelve and then it just ends up being this weird race to the bottom where you end up with these really fast a little and marowak when a little and marowak has terrible speed and so the only thing it out speeds is itself and then everyone gets to max speed a little and marowak and that's a terrible thing that doesn't work on anything and then people revert to okay I might as well just do a bulky hello and Merrill and then every Street where somebody goes oh yeah my back too bulky I'm just gonna put forward in now it's it's a VGC is a wild wild world ah number two on Mason's question list which is your least favorite type - ferry which I realize I may get hate for Bell stick to my opinion I think I've said this before mine is normal I don't think normal should exist I like normal a lot ferry and ice are my two favorites ice being my favorite second favorite being ferry that although they said least favorite right yeah yeah a fire it's just an animal that's on fire Wow of creative you take an animal and you make it on fire cool I like fire type a lot um it's a tough question there's like so many types out there but out with flying why is a good answer why would be way better if they got rid of normal not everything was normal flying oh it's the worst but then but then it makes tornadoes not special turn anise is cool because it's just fly only one a third question if you lived in any region any town in the region spin-off games included which would it be I am tied between saffron and goldenrod thanks for taking my email into consideration Mason who any town any region I think I've answered this before but I'm going to change I want to move to a polluted city Travis if I can move to any city in the Pokemon world the question was yeah huh I mean I would probably pick one of the big cities I would probably pick a lumiose would be cool all right sure I'll I like city life rather than you know your smaller town life yeah hmm goldenrod has the Train which is pretty cool trains are cool correct I might go celadon because they have the gambling center and they have the bike path off it and it's close to that intersection that connects the other four towns yeah I'll go with celadon it all says a mall that wasn't too hard last email will do here I don't know if I said that last time last email will do here is Sam writes in for packed South title-pack South hey s PJ and crew it's your boy Sam I am writing in to ask you if you guys are going to pack South in San Antonio next year if you are that would be my only reason to come since I live in middle Lothian Texas man all these plays Lothian okay Evan did you know where that one is well no I just know how to pronounce it okay all right which is five to six hours away from San Antonio of course my parents would make me mow the lawn for the rest of 2017 but I to actually meet you guys would be totally worth it I'd rather meet you guys than buy switch or Pokemon stars well I mean this is probably gonna be the same games as jet seven I love the show and it cannot wait for season three of mythical to be released because I love meepo so much that's all you Travis sorry for the long email Sam PS please give a shout-out to my hometown of Texas shout-out givin me PO is more Greg than me Nami bows all you it wouldn't be anybody doesn't play yours hereafter man true memo's hundred percent you uh-oh forty percent me we applied for pax west which is September 1st through the the fourth or fifth if I'm not mistaken uh so hopefully we can get into that and go to that I know uh all three of us were at PAX eath East and I think that was a very successful overall I know Travis went on record saying they don't they don't like they don't like conventions so I mean I didn't I didn't and like act specifically like I don't think I would ever really like a gaming convention like a board game or video game convention that's that even though I like both of those things like that in a convention setting isn't very exciting to me I would I mean that doesn't mean I wouldn't still do up a panel at at PAX if we were at one just means oh yeah I'll mope for a bit the rest of the day the nice thing about so I went to pax in San Antonio the very first year it set up and the nice thing about that is it's very cheap to fly to Texas for some odd reason whereas flying to Seattle is is really expensive every year like I've been watching ticket prices ever since January and they're they have not gone down yet and this little app keeps telling me like keep waiting it'll go down so I don't know if it's doable to do like three paksas a year but now that pax south is growing and I definitely want to go to San Antonio again because that city is just beautiful I would love to go but we'd have to play by ear after after pax west and and who's that who knows that they could completely be possible pax is just like thanks but no thanks we have better panels and better podcast and better events that we want to have instead of instead of it's super effective that's totally possible but you know if the patreon still does okay and and people are still listening the show and you know more Pokemon games get released and stuff and we'll have stuff to talk about I will for sure apply for pax south and let you guys know right now though we're just waiting on if PAX West is going to accept us or not so a great question though thank you yeah I know we have a lot of cool listeners in San Antonio that I would love to go and visit so yeah that would be a plus for me the other thing that I think we've talked about this before just taking consideration is just like we all work forty hours like we all have jobs and they can only give us so many days off a year and sometimes I want a week off that isn't at a convention not that I don't like I love conventions uh but they are not like relaxing in any sense it's it's really a balance of time when it comes to stuff like that and with Travis going to Canada I don't know how flying works not only for a given it'll just be more expensive but yeah I mean uh that's not gonna be I mean I'm loaded that's not true at all but I mean like it's not gonna be loaded an ad and uh and I don't even know what the coin is called I freaked out when Carly oh yeah you got your loonies you got your yeah yeah yeah the loonies into I thought she was lying so I text you but but the simple answer is that the forward thrust created by either the Jets or the propeller on the airplane generate lift under the wings as it causes the plane go upwards interest out flying works interesting okay ah but we'll play by ear Peck Sothis is quite a while away ah we still have a backlog of emails um we're catching up but if you have any email if you have any questions comments or concerns you can shoot those over to SBJ at pkmn cast calm or pokmon podcast.com slash or slash contact I guess works or just hit the contact button at the top of page either way I am going to throw it over to Travis they're going to indulge your ears for Pokemon of the week yeah our set this week comes for oh yeah I supposed to say what Pokemon it is the Pokemon this week for Pokemon of the week is vanilluxe my second favorite Pokemon of all time behind piloswine it's vanilluxe with an ICM Z or an assault vest it's gonna be the same set either way it's just the assault vest is going to give you more bulk and the ICM Z is going to give you the ability to take out a large target you wouldn't otherwise have the power to do the ability is snow warning that's an ability like drizzle and drought where it will cause rain - sorry not rain it will cause a weather effect to appear when the Pokemon is set in in the case of snow warning that will be Hale the nature is going to be timid and then your EVs are going to be 252 in Special Attack and 252 in speed with 4 and HP the move set is going to be blizzard freeze dry flash cannon and then either icy wind or protect if you're Iying protect you won't want to put the assault vest on there the description Kevin gives you is the best thing about vanilluxe is its ability which sets up Hale automatically this gives a great advantage on Blizzard as it will never miss freeze dry hits water types that's another move that's really interesting so if listeners don't know freeze dry is a nice type move but it is super effective against water types that's its special effect and then flash cannon hurts fairies protect is a great move for the last slot but alternatively icy wind hits both opponents which is nice as does blizzard but the thing about icy when does it also lowers the speed of the targets by one stage which can be very useful in certain circumstances the thing about vanilluxe is it's really competing for its slot with nine tails because nine tails also has the ability snow warning and also is going to be wanting to spam blizzard over and over again so the thing that sets the two of them apart nine tails is generally going to be faster and vanilluxe has a little more a ten nine tails as a better move pool frankly but vanilluxe has more special attacks so is able to one at Keio a few more things than is nine tails Aloha nine tails that is the other thing I would add is that if you wanted to do things a little bit differently than the set Kevin mentioned you can basically run the same moves with the exception of protect and give it a choice scarf and then you can out speed a lot of common threats and one at Keio a lot of things you know your your guard Trump's of the world things like that there's a lot of things that are four times weak to ice so being able to have a choice scarfed blizzard from vanilluxe with 100% accuracy pretty great so either choice scarf i CMZ assault vest you got a lot of item options there you're definitely going to do snow warning is the ability and then that moves that's pretty great too if you get a shot vanilluxe has a disappointing shiny shiny vanilluxe is just more blue than it is ice color white no but like that water down blue oh it's more of a deeper blue is what I would say yes yeah and the shiny is more of a sky-blue only one bit of trivia here is according to Game Freak vanilluxe and its evolutionary relatives were created by James Turner you guys are probably like who is James Turner he's a British the first American to de son Oh British dang Britain Western grad design the first Westerner to the site in Pokemon ah currently works at Game Freak in 2010 he became the first Westerner to officially design Pokemon Turner designed the seven Pokemon for black and white and two for Pokemon X&Y and two for Pokemon Sun and Moon here is the list oh it's a good list too vanillite vanillish vanilluxe gullet golurk Wolle be manda buzz fan tump trevenant buzz whoa and Gus Lord I like so many of those Pokemon yeah they're all really great then a good-looking guy - hello Internet vanilluxe maybe a combination of vanilla and deluxe and there you go I don't think anybody's gonna argue with that no no all right a little bit of housecleaning before we go I have changed some patreon rewards around there is a replaced an old $25 tier with a new $25 tier so if you are in the old tier please please make this switch to the new one you'll get all the same benefits but the new one will ask for your address and you do get some new benefits that involves me mailing stickers and stuff to you and yeah so if you want to support us on patreon patreon comm slash it's super effective ITSs you pe r EF f ec TI ve that is your spelling lesson for the day I don't have any good Dreamsicle stories or anything to end with this time Travis will you got anything Travis what's your you get a new season of your show yeah yeah well we haven't launched season two a very random encounters yet but we are what we raring right now is a one-shot we were recorded with sean mccoy of the podcast gz net games and also the image the game company the we're playing a game called monster the week which is based on stuff like supernatural Buffy the Vampire Slayer you know your Scooby Doo's you know any any serial TV show Twin Peaks to some extent that's coming out today holy cow any TV show that's that's based on like our x-files definitely that has like a monster of the week that appears and terrorizes things we played an RPG called monster of the week that's based on shows like that the way very random encounters works is every time we play a new game there is absolutely no continuity with older games so you can certainly start with the first episode of our monster of the week special and then in a few weeks we'll have season two and you can totally start there as well the way the show works is we randomly determine as many things as possible that includes our characters names the places were in the villains their motivations other very strange things it sort of inverts the idea of role-playing games as a power fantasy because very little is within the control of our characters it ends up being a really wacky fun time very random encounters it's on iTunes in any place you're going to get a podcast awesome awesome I suppose well you can you do you want to pimp your podcast I mean we're up to episode 60 so far would be recording episode 61 this week so we have literally recorded in episode a week for the past little more than a year about card fight Vanguard it's called Drive check it's one of the best card fight Vanguard podcasts you can find - are you still flying every week played a guard yeah well when I'm not recording podcast about Pokemon I certainly am I you know I play with friends and stuff yes and I actually recently started playing a new what we call in Vanguard clan a new deck so that's been an interesting adventure for me otherwise if you haven't done so already please leave us a review in iTunes you can follow us on twitter at pokemon podcast you can follow Travis on Twitter at the Travis W you can follow will on Twitter at wash in the sink and you can follow me on twitter at dragging a lake otherwise I think
