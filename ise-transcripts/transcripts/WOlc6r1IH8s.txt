episode of the Pokemon podcast (1:02 - 1:08)
I'm your host SBJ it's super effective (1:04 - 1:11)
with me today I have will yeah I was (1:08 - 1:13)
gonna say that we're fortuitous because (1:11 - 1:16)
I just hatched a snubbull in Pokemon (1:13 - 1:19)
moon and that that launched and go so (1:16 - 1:22)
smooth so maybe the snubbull is actually (1:19 - 1:25)
a sign of danger to come in poke my (1:22 - 1:29)
gorgeous danger sitting right here no no (1:25 - 1:31)
for this program house record is (1:29 - 1:34)
recording I see this disaster that we're (1:31 - 1:37)
about to stumble into Trev that thing (1:34 - 1:39)
we're about to do Travis you're back (1:37 - 1:41)
you're here it's true I've been gone so (1:39 - 1:45)
long that some some I feel like a lot of (1:41 - 1:46)
incredibly important things that (1:45 - 1:49)
happened in my life first of off I'm in (1:46 - 1:52)
first of all I'm engaged now which is a (1:49 - 1:54)
big deal but perhaps more importantly I (1:52 - 1:57)
like Zelda now why which is a thing (1:54 - 1:59)
which is the thing I didn't like before (1:57 - 2:03)
I don't why all right let's get real why (1:59 - 2:05)
should I let's talk about the important (2:03 - 2:07)
thing right now yeah (2:05 - 2:11)
Zelda well first off when you say that (2:07 - 2:14)
you're engaged that means like to be (2:11 - 2:16)
married to another human being right (2:14 - 2:19)
correct so Travis proposed to an (2:16 - 2:22)
attendance which is okay he'll in love (2:19 - 2:27)
with Zelda yeah so my fiance Carly (2:22 - 2:30)
basically told me like you never buy (2:27 - 2:33)
anything for yourself so I mean that's (2:30 - 2:35)
kind of noted on the show right that I (2:33 - 2:38)
have the launched version of whatever (2:35 - 2:40)
handheld console comes out I never get (2:38 - 2:44)
the upgraded DES or 3ds or anything I (2:40 - 2:45)
always end up with just with the (2:44 - 2:48)
launched one and I never upgrade so it's (2:45 - 2:50)
documented on the show that I never get (2:48 - 2:52)
anything for myself so she told me that (2:50 - 2:54)
I should buy a thing for myself and so I (2:52 - 2:57)
bought a switch and there's like one (2:54 - 3:00)
game on the switch so know even though (2:57 - 3:03)
I'm wrong even there you idiot Tetris (3:00 - 3:06)
I'm yeah I know I would be terrible at (3:03 - 3:07)
it I'll probably get it at some point (3:06 - 3:09)
along with us nipper clips or snipper (3:07 - 3:12)
Clippers whatever it's called anyway so (3:09 - 3:13)
I bought Zelda (3:12 - 3:16)
it's a good game turns out all that (3:13 - 3:17)
Legend of Zelda had to do to win me over (3:16 - 3:19)
was make a game that's actually like (3:17 - 3:21)
good and fun turns out that's the only (3:19 - 3:22)
thing they needed to do to make me like (3:21 - 3:22)
it (3:22 - 3:26)
how rare animals are these pretty (3:22 - 3:28)
different yeah I thought you were going (3:26 - 3:30)
to say that Carly um said that you'd (3:28 - 3:32)
never buy yourself anything so she was (3:30 - 3:34)
like here I bought you a ring because (3:32 - 3:36)
you never buy anything for yourself and (3:34 - 3:37)
I thought that would be like the latest (3:36 - 3:40)
proposal ever that was not how she (3:37 - 3:43)
proposed to me was it over some like (3:40 - 3:45)
freshwater cod or something like that (3:43 - 3:49)
but no we were uh we were at the (3:45 - 3:52)
gorgeous Beach of Lake Michigan at a (3:49 - 3:55)
kind of tucked away park that isn't (3:52 - 3:58)
visited too much so I think you're (3:55 - 3:59)
giving looks on the beach though you're (3:58 - 4:01)
given Lake Michigan too much credit our (3:59 - 4:03)
side of Lake Michigan is actually quite (4:01 - 4:04)
beautiful you just happen to live on the (4:03 - 4:06)
bad side of it oh okay are you gonna (4:04 - 4:08)
tell me that there's no freshwater cod (4:06 - 4:11)
in Lake Michigan I mean light I don't (4:08 - 4:14)
know anything about fish but we weren't (4:11 - 4:16)
like eating it didn't you do a whole (4:14 - 4:19)
like segment on Twitter about this (4:16 - 4:22)
particular fish that is popular in Grand (4:19 - 4:25)
Rapids well I mean there's a lot that's (4:22 - 4:28)
about what the city is Club but less oh (4:25 - 4:31)
yeah there's a lot of perch let's perch (4:28 - 4:34)
cod it's all the same thing what are we (4:31 - 4:37)
sorting him that's a show for yesterday (4:34 - 4:40)
we'll see it I like Zelda now oh good (4:37 - 4:43)
good I don't want to dwell too long on (4:40 - 4:45)
Zelda but how how far are you is there (4:43 - 4:48)
less uline shrine number oh you beat it (4:45 - 4:53)
I've done 90 91 92 shrines something (4:48 - 4:57)
like that alright out of 120 120 how (4:53 - 4:59)
many did you get all nine hundred core (4:57 - 5:05)
exceeds oh heavens no I'm not a I'm not (4:59 - 5:08)
gonna torture myself I know you do get (5:05 - 5:10)
something you get something apparently (5:08 - 5:12)
quote unquote cool when you get all nine (5:10 - 5:14)
hundred I don't know what it is Oh how (5:12 - 5:15)
would a person that feasibly do that (5:14 - 5:18)
without using the Internet I mean like (5:15 - 5:19)
that has to be the only way right or I (5:18 - 5:21)
guess you know when you open you look at (5:19 - 5:24)
the map there's something everywhere so (5:21 - 5:25)
you could look at pockets of nothingness (5:24 - 5:26)
on the map and (5:25 - 5:28)
go there's probably a core exceed there (5:26 - 5:31)
that would take so long although I kind (5:28 - 5:33)
of did that with Skyrim when I went on (5:31 - 5:35)
my quest to find every location on the (5:33 - 5:38)
map without using the Internet and I did (5:35 - 5:42)
well let me this is this is a show about (5:38 - 5:44)
Pokemon who would have guessed millet (5:42 - 5:48)
let me lay out the show here we're going (5:44 - 5:50)
to be recapping some news on Zelda and (5:48 - 5:52)
then we got some emails about that and (5:50 - 5:54)
then we're going to do our zelda of the (5:52 - 5:54)
week (5:54 - 5:57)
so know we got some Pokemon news with (5:54 - 6:01)
some update to Sun and Moon Pokemon go (5:57 - 6:04)
stuff then we have some emails and then (6:01 - 6:07)
Travis is back for our Pokemon of the (6:04 - 6:09)
week which will be vanilluxe this week (6:07 - 6:12)
and that will be our show for you guys (6:09 - 6:16)
so let's kick that off with some Pokemon (6:12 - 6:20)
news first bit of news here is Magikarp (6:16 - 6:24)
jump was released in Italy also known as (6:20 - 6:27)
splash Magikarp I think it was it's (6:24 - 6:30)
known in Japan but apparently not out in (6:27 - 6:32)
Japan the freemium this is off bubble (6:30 - 6:35)
pedia the freemium mobile game Pokemon (6:32 - 6:37)
Magikarp jump is now available (6:35 - 6:40)
ah for iOS in Italy after being (6:37 - 6:43)
announced in Japan in February the game (6:40 - 6:45)
is currently not available for Android (6:43 - 6:47)
although the game has been localized (6:45 - 6:50)
from japanese to english french spanish (6:47 - 6:52)
korean and chinese it is currently not (6:50 - 6:55)
available in these language the release (6:52 - 6:56)
of the game has not officially been (6:55 - 7:00)
promoted although I do think the Italian (6:56 - 7:02)
Pokemon Twitter account did tweet about (7:00 - 7:04)
it a day or two ago (7:02 - 7:09)
so why Italy first who knows we got a (7:04 - 7:11)
lot of Magikarp over there is a lot of (7:09 - 7:11)
water (7:11 - 7:15)
maybe somebody water running the Italian (7:11 - 7:20)
App Store accidentally hit the publish (7:15 - 7:23)
button and then they just had to roll (7:20 - 7:25)
with it yeah right they just had like it (7:23 - 7:29)
makes no sense that even 24 hours after (7:25 - 7:31)
the Italian release it didn't show up (7:29 - 7:34)
anywhere else and now it's been 5 days 6 (7:31 - 7:36)
days since it's been out and still (7:34 - 7:37)
nothing (7:36 - 7:39)
yeah like I don't have any theories for (7:37 - 7:40)
you it's strange (7:39 - 7:42)
it looks cool yeah I am I looked in the (7:40 - 7:44)
app store this morning and it wasn't (7:42 - 7:46)
there so confirmed it's not there (7:44 - 7:49)
yeah my only guess is is somebody else (7:46 - 7:50)
will be getting it this week (7:49 - 7:53)
I can't imagine Italy is just gonna have (7:50 - 7:55)
it early for like a month straight (7:53 - 7:59)
next the Vatican's gonna get it I will (7:55 - 8:01)
report more on that on that game wanna (7:59 - 8:04)
know anything about it like what it is (8:01 - 8:09)
yes okay so it's based off a another (8:04 - 8:13)
mobile game called survive mole mola (8:09 - 8:16)
mola I I don't know what that means (8:13 - 8:18)
well that's what the what that's what (8:16 - 8:23)
the other game is and that exists in the (8:18 - 8:27)
Google Play Store wait and in iTunes Inc (8:23 - 8:32)
I I think I played that it it has (8:27 - 8:36)
according to their description it has (8:32 - 8:39)
five million downloads I think I played (8:36 - 8:41)
this I mean briefly because at this (8:39 - 8:43)
point I was using a terrible phone for (8:41 - 8:47)
um that is like a phone that you should (8:43 - 8:48)
give someone like as a punishment so it (8:47 - 8:50)
didn't run very well but Carly really (8:48 - 8:52)
wanted me to play cuz she was playing at (8:50 - 8:54)
the time you play as like a fish I don't (8:52 - 8:55)
even remember what yeah do you but I (8:54 - 8:58)
think you have like stats that increase (8:55 - 9:01)
or something yeah weird like that some (8:58 - 9:03)
things that are like really silly and (9:01 - 9:05)
you have to get bigger and bigger this (9:03 - 9:07)
is what I'm seeing from the internet (9:05 - 9:09)
yeah yeah that game I was thinking of (9:07 - 9:13)
yeah it's I mean like you go to if you (9:09 - 9:16)
want to know what Magikarp jump splash (9:13 - 9:18)
Magikarp if you want to know what that (9:16 - 9:20)
game is you can its it survive (9:18 - 9:24)
exclamation mark mola mola mo la mo la (9:20 - 9:28)
two words but it's free in iTunes it was (9:24 - 9:32)
last updated may 17 2007 teen correct (9:28 - 9:36)
and it has in-app purchases wow yeah (9:32 - 9:39)
splash Magikarp does too oh I like how (9:36 - 9:41)
the description doesn't actually (9:39 - 9:44)
describe the game itself though I mean (9:41 - 9:46)
it kind of does if you look at the (9:44 - 9:48)
little pictures that (9:46 - 9:51)
basically the mola mola is very frail oh (9:48 - 9:53)
here we go here we got how to play (9:51 - 9:56)
don't let your mola die grow your mola (9:53 - 10:00)
to the world's biggest 2.5 T class how (9:56 - 10:02)
to play number one eat ocean creatures (10:00 - 10:05)
to gain weight all right sounds like a (10:02 - 10:06)
Saturday night (10:05 - 10:08)
number two test your luck and go on (10:06 - 10:10)
adventures to gain weight (10:08 - 10:12)
number three strengthen your mola and (10:10 - 10:16)
gain weight number four death is not the (10:12 - 10:19)
end start a new game molas get stronger (10:16 - 10:24)
when they die oh the what yeah they die (10:19 - 10:27)
a lot and then like you spend like the (10:24 - 10:29)
points I think gosh it's all blur but I (10:27 - 10:31)
think when you die then you get the (10:29 - 10:34)
points associated with whatever score (10:31 - 10:36)
you had based on how large you got and (10:34 - 10:37)
you can spend those points unlike (10:36 - 10:41)
abilities for your future molas oh so (10:37 - 10:45)
it's like trim okay now I'm starting to (10:41 - 10:46)
understand I went to download mola mola (10:45 - 10:50)
and if we don't get Magikarp splash (10:46 - 10:52)
within the next week I'll at least have (10:50 - 10:55)
something to report on here (10:52 - 10:58)

shared it fixes the following a glitch (11:15 - 11:20)
involving spikey shield and sky drop (11:18 - 11:23)
that caused the user of sky drop unable (11:20 - 11:26)
to move or switch out if it faints due (11:23 - 11:28)
to the damage from spikey shield number (11:26 - 11:31)
2 a glitch that caused all activities in (11:28 - 11:34)
pokey pella go to complete if the date (11:31 - 11:36)

if that's a glitch that's more of just (11:36 - 11:42)
people changing the date yeah ah number (11:38 - 11:44)
three a glitch that caused a game to (11:42 - 11:46)
crash if the player used in evolution (11:44 - 11:49)
item with that item being the last item (11:46 - 11:51)

under services some circumstances that's (12:01 - 12:06)
I don't know that's not a glitch that (12:03 - 12:07)
seems pretty sweet if I have a focus (12:06 - 12:10)
band let me put it around the egg I (12:07 - 12:12)
don't see any problems with that one and (12:10 - 12:14)
the last one a glitch ending the (12:12 - 12:16)
tournament when pre-registered for an (12:14 - 12:20)
online friendly competition EG entry (12:16 - 12:22)

experienced any of those glitches I (12:51 - 12:55)
don't know if you guys have nah they're (12:53 - 12:58)
pretty niche right like I can't imagine (12:55 - 13:01)
using an evolution item when I don't (12:58 - 13:04)
have anything else in my bag I'm I'm not (13:01 - 13:08)
like breeding an epic for an epic (13:04 - 13:11)
vivillon sweep like vivillon sorry if my (13:08 - 13:13)
French pronunciation is incorrect yeah (13:11 - 13:15)
like so like scatterbug isn't gonna be (13:13 - 13:18)
too relevant to me so I I have not (13:15 - 13:20)

exotic places because of said money well (14:44 - 14:50)

went through he's like no you don't need (14:58 - 15:01)
a really expensive camera you just need (14:59 - 15:04)
like these particular kinds of the (15:01 - 15:06)
receptor like the ISO level of the (15:04 - 15:08)
acceptor and everything but what he does (15:06 - 15:10)
have is that money so he can travel all (15:08 - 15:11)
around the world to all the fantastic (15:10 - 15:14)
places and also enough money to pay like (15:11 - 15:16)
other people to just go away so he can (15:14 - 15:19)
have his pictures all on his home he's (15:16 - 15:21)
proudly using like an iPhone 3GS or (15:19 - 15:24)

portfolio so um I'm doing things I'm (15:30 - 15:35)
pretty picky about who I follow on (15:33 - 15:37)
Instagram now I used to follow like (15:35 - 15:39)
everyone like oh you're your Twitter (15:37 - 15:41)
friend your Facebook friend I'm just (15:39 - 15:42)
gonna follow you but now I have (15:41 - 15:45)
eliminated it to just people who are (15:42 - 15:48)
taking good photos like I don't need a (15:45 - 15:52)
photo of your dinner but if you're like (15:48 - 15:56)
my ones don't follow my fiance why are (15:52 - 15:58)
you following me cuz all I do is take (15:56 - 15:59)
pictures of my pets and my food (15:58 - 16:01)
yeah they're not the greatest yeah no (15:59 - 16:04)
there's a there's a couple exceptions (16:01 - 16:06)
but for the most part I do want my (16:04 - 16:08)
Instagram feed to be nothing but like (16:06 - 16:10)
photos I go oh yeah that looks good ah (16:08 - 16:14)
yeah that's a good shot if I go why is (16:10 - 16:16)
the sentence why is this picture worthy (16:14 - 16:17)
then you're probably going to get an (16:16 - 16:19)
unfollow unless your name is will and (16:17 - 16:21)
I'll probably keep you well (16:19 - 16:24)
some those shiny pokemon I was taking (16:21 - 16:26)
pictures of that was pretty cool I (16:24 - 16:28)
remember all your bugs no that's that's (16:26 - 16:30)
that's unfollow worthy you know what I (16:28 - 16:33)
don't want to see my Instagram feed bugs (16:30 - 16:36)
but it was it lit it legitimately was an (16:33 - 16:38)
off-colored cicada because the cicadas (16:36 - 16:40)
are usually black and that one was like (16:38 - 16:42)
light green it was a little edge it emit (16:40 - 16:45)
real life shiny my Instagram is watching (16:42 - 16:47)
the sink if anybody wants to follow okay (16:45 - 16:50)
I handle comment below shares of bugs at (16:47 - 16:53)
least your cat's not eating them my cats (16:50 - 16:55)
eat bugs ever now then no my dog is like (16:53 - 16:57)
literally eating all of them as we walk (16:55 - 16:59)
down the street she's scooping them up (16:57 - 17:01)
like this popcorn time at the movie (16:59 - 17:05)
theater speaking of Pokemon go they have (17:01 - 17:07)
an Instagram account but there is also a (17:05 - 17:10)
new special event going on right now (17:07 - 17:13)
this is off business insider Pokemon go (17:10 - 17:15)
creator Niantic labs is currently (17:13 - 17:17)
throwing an in-game celebration dubbed (17:15 - 17:20)
adventure week with R with reward and (17:17 - 17:22)
rewards players with a handful of (17:20 - 17:25)
bonuses one of those bonuses include (17:22 - 17:27)
spawning certain rock-type pokémon (17:25 - 17:29)
including rare creatures like Aerodactyl (17:27 - 17:33)
I pulled this article off Business (17:29 - 17:36)
Insider because they have a spawn chart (17:33 - 17:43)
from reddit user solid ah anyway sure (17:36 - 17:44)
that's exactly how it's supposed to be (17:43 - 17:47)
son yep uh it just shows which Pokemon (17:44 - 17:49)
are actually spawning for this event so (17:47 - 17:52)
it's sudowoodo Geodude gravel or golem (17:49 - 17:58)
onyx oma night our lord helix omastar (17:52 - 18:01)
butoh Kabutops Aerodactyl larvae thar (17:58 - 18:06)

chuckle mcCargo and corsola also slugma (18:06 - 18:16)
is definitely also spawning this chart (18:12 - 18:18)
is missing slugma were you doing the (18:16 - 18:23)
pokerap no but uh the other benefits of (18:18 - 18:25)
here is okay so this event will also (18:23 - 18:29)
goes to May 25th are the last event what (18:25 - 18:31)
was the last of it was a grass I believe (18:29 - 18:33)
it was pretty sure was grass it was like (18:31 - 18:37)
three days long this event was a full (18:33 - 18:39)
week buddy Pokemon only need to walk one (18:37 - 18:41)
quarter of the normal distance to find (18:39 - 18:43)
candy so we'll collect at every three (18:41 - 18:46)
kilometers more items will be collected (18:43 - 18:48)
from each poke stop there is also a new (18:46 - 18:50)
adventure hat available for all trainers (18:48 - 18:52)
to wear in the game that hat does not (18:50 - 18:55)
cost any money and select Maya's fire (18:52 - 18:56)
type only (18:55 - 18:57)
which is why it's not on the list oh (18:56 - 18:59)
yeah that's right but it does it is (18:57 - 19:01)
spotting way more frequently because (18:59 - 19:03)
I've never saw a slugma until this event (19:01 - 19:05)
started and now I'm seeing hundreds of (19:03 - 19:07)
them you guys been playing are you on an (19:05 - 19:10)
adventure rock over here eventually I (19:07 - 19:12)
haven't had the opportunity but um I (19:10 - 19:16)
mean you've got your your Apple watch is (19:12 - 19:19)
now performing adequately for performing (19:16 - 19:21)
pokemon go activities yeah you told me (19:19 - 19:23)
yeah so I was at the mall yesterday (19:21 - 19:25)
Irene wanted to go shopping together (19:23 - 19:28)
which was involved her going shopping (19:25 - 19:31)
and me just walking around the mall in a (19:28 - 19:33)
circle collecting polka stops very been (19:31 - 19:35)
in this situation with you before it was (19:33 - 19:37)
a very good bonding experience right (19:35 - 19:39)
where we were we were still not together (19:37 - 19:42)
but at least we're at the same we're the (19:39 - 19:45)
same building I tried the pokey I tried (19:42 - 19:47)
the watch the Apple watch because I had (19:45 - 19:49)
nothing but problems problems with it (19:47 - 19:52)
and so I turned it on it lasted for (19:49 - 19:53)
about fourteen seconds and it crashed (19:52 - 19:56)
and then I did my this is garbage I'm (19:53 - 19:58)
very disappointed and then I did it (19:56 - 20:01)
again and it worked just fine I was able (19:58 - 20:04)
to I did a 34 minute walk I think (20:01 - 20:07)
throughout the mall I counted my steps (20:04 - 20:10)
to count at the time it showed me (20:07 - 20:12)
which Pokemon are in the area when I (20:10 - 20:14)
looked at the watch when I opened or (20:12 - 20:16)
closed the Pokemon Go app it didn't (20:14 - 20:19)
interfere with the watch at all it was (20:16 - 20:20)
nice because I was able to get my steps (20:19 - 20:22)
I was able to hatch eggs but also check (20:20 - 20:24)
Twitter at the same time and then at the (20:22 - 20:27)
end it like built a little workout and (20:24 - 20:28)
then put it into my Apple health kit of (20:27 - 20:30)
like this is how many steps you took and (20:28 - 20:32)
this was really go 35 minute walk (20:30 - 20:34)
exercise quote-unquote till those little (20:32 - 20:36)
activity bars I was very happy with it (20:34 - 20:39)
maybe I'll come I'm considered starting (20:36 - 20:42)
walking to work so I might start Pokemon (20:39 - 20:43)
going as I walk to work well you all (20:42 - 20:45)
walk for you (20:43 - 20:48)
ah to work is to miles oh that's not bad (20:45 - 20:49)
oh yeah the only reason I don't do it is (20:48 - 20:52)
because I have to like get places during (20:49 - 20:54)
the day but I'm trying to do a an (20:52 - 20:57)
economic analysis of whether it is less (20:54 - 21:01)
expensive to either pay for the parking (20:57 - 21:04)
at work which is not cheap at all or to (21:01 - 21:08)
take a app-based ride-sharing service at (21:04 - 21:10)
the times when I actually need to take a (21:08 - 21:13)
car someplace during the day and alright (21:10 - 21:14)
I'll be I'll be over here crunching the (21:13 - 21:16)
numbers for yeah I got the spreadsheets (21:14 - 21:18)
out you I've got those those old (21:16 - 21:20)
calculators that like print out the (21:18 - 21:22)
result instead of just displaying it (21:20 - 21:26)
yeah I got I got I'm rocking some (21:22 - 21:29)
abacuses Abuk I do you have one of those (21:26 - 21:33)
green plastic cat brim hats yeah my (21:29 - 21:36)
countin swear will I was envisioning (21:33 - 21:38)
that exact I didn't say it but I was (21:36 - 21:43)
envisioning that exact green visor yep (21:38 - 21:47)
there you go are like TI 87 I don't know (21:43 - 21:49)
what the number is 89 s are those so (21:47 - 21:53)
thing I think they're 84 right or TI 82 (21:49 - 21:58)
TI 80 84 carta our kids are kids still (21:53 - 21:59)
using those are they just using their (21:58 - 22:01)
iPhones because I feel like an iPhone is (21:59 - 22:03)
way more powerful I don't think it has (22:01 - 22:05)
other graphing calculator applications (22:03 - 22:09)
there has to be I mean probably yes (22:05 - 22:12)
ti-84 um yeah all the kids who can (22:09 - 22:13)
afford iPhones (22:12 - 22:15)
sure (22:13 - 22:19)
I'm yeah yeah Adam worth later ain't (22:15 - 22:21)
cheap there was that you know when I was (22:19 - 22:23)
in high school yeah that's like a lot of (22:21 - 22:24)
money (22:23 - 22:27)
yeah and I'm I'm I I would I would (22:24 - 22:30)
imagine that most kids have an Android (22:27 - 22:34)
or an iPhone or look if you yet so even (22:30 - 22:37)
if you say iPhones aren't cheap whether (22:34 - 22:38)
or not you qualify for an upgrade or not (22:37 - 22:41)
Android phones are pretty cheap and I (22:38 - 22:42)
would assume that the google play store (22:41 - 22:45)
isn't restrictive of apps I would assume (22:42 - 22:48)
that the cheapest Android smartphone is (22:45 - 22:51)
probably still more powerful then a (22:48 - 22:55)
ti-84 yeah but you don't get blocked (22:51 - 23:00)
dude is the thing or Dino puzzle or (22:55 - 23:02)
whatever the other games were on there I (23:00 - 23:04)
mean of course I was like a snake clone (23:02 - 23:05)
or whatever but I'm blocked dude but (23:04 - 23:08)
also is that the trade-off for the (23:05 - 23:10)
smartphone is you have to have a mobile (23:08 - 23:13)
service plan with a ti-84 you have a (23:10 - 23:16)
calculator and you're done I want is (23:13 - 23:18)
there is the right I want a study of (23:16 - 23:20)
like how many kids in school don't have (23:18 - 23:22)
a smartphone or don't have a phone at (23:20 - 23:26)
all I promise you plenty if phones are (23:22 - 23:29)
expensive not if you just get like a (23:26 - 23:31)
flip phone for your kid it's like a (23:29 - 23:33)
$9.99 a month out of that get out of (23:31 - 23:37)
that upper-class liberal bubble you live (23:33 - 23:40)
in exactly down here to the real world (23:37 - 23:45)
the hardcore City of Milwaukee as as I'm (23:40 - 23:46)
talking to you on an expensive (23:45 - 23:50)
microphone pairing my giant desktop (23:46 - 23:53)
computer to my iPhone to be able to time (23:50 - 23:56)
to be able to talk to you on this motor (23:53 - 23:58)
talk about Oh adventure week adventure (23:56 - 24:02)
whoo yeah whatever (23:58 - 24:05)
so I played I was at the mall probably (24:02 - 24:07)
for an hour and a half started my mall (24:05 - 24:12)
journey at like 96 percent on my iphone (24:07 - 24:14)
ended my mall journey in that hour and a (24:12 - 24:17)
half at like two percent on my iPhone I (24:14 - 24:22)
forgot how playing Pokemon go non-stop (24:17 - 24:25)
destroys your battery but I cut a lot of (24:22 - 24:26)
Geodude (24:25 - 24:28)
and my Pikachu got enough candy to get a (24:26 - 24:30)
ride too so I finally have a ride shoe (24:28 - 24:34)
and I got the I got the more cargo I got (24:30 - 24:37)
a bunch of Rhyhorn zai got two larvae (24:34 - 24:40)
tarz I've I'm in Kabuto City nothing but (24:37 - 24:43)
Kabuto everywhere hopefully by the end (24:40 - 24:45)
of the week I'll have a golem I'm at (24:43 - 24:48)
like 80 candy for golem or to get a (24:45 - 24:54)
golem so I'm very satisfied with with (24:48 - 24:57)
this event I also believe pokeballs are (24:54 - 24:59)
on sale even though I wouldn't buy (24:57 - 25:01)
pokeballs just because if I can go to (24:59 - 25:04)
the mall and hit like five stops every (25:01 - 25:07)
five minutes and and that's fine but I'm (25:04 - 25:08)
pretty sure pokeballs are on sale for (25:07 - 25:10)
those that don't have a lot of stops buy (25:08 - 25:13)
them they're 50% off so it's 50 coins (25:10 - 25:17)
for 20 balls instead of 100 coins for 20 (25:13 - 25:20)
balls and so on and so forth but I think (25:17 - 25:22)
the last event the grass week it was too (25:20 - 25:25)
short and I don't think it's spawned (25:22 - 25:28)
grass pokemon as frequently as other (25:25 - 25:30)
events did in the past and how this (25:28 - 25:32)
event is doing currently (25:30 - 25:35)
if Pokemon go if Niantic is doing this (25:32 - 25:38)
like this one-week event once a month I (25:35 - 25:41)
think that's more than enough to keep (25:38 - 25:44)
people playing but didn't they ever ties (25:41 - 25:45)
that there was going to be some special (25:44 - 25:48)
secret Pokemon as part of this event I (25:45 - 25:52)
don't think I ever saw that I think I (25:48 - 25:53)
saw that on the news or heard it on the (25:52 - 25:55)
news cuz I can't watch news anymore (25:53 - 25:56)
because you convinced me to get rid of (25:55 - 25:57)
cable and I'll never forgive you for (25:56 - 25:58)
that (25:57 - 26:01)
ah save any money (25:58 - 26:05)
money inside of money yes speaking of (26:01 - 26:09)
the mall squirtle is the next Pokemon (26:05 - 26:11)
headed to build-a-bear workshop this (26:09 - 26:15)
article is off polygons build-a-bear (26:11 - 26:17)
workshops Pokemon collection is (26:15 - 26:19)
expanding once more squirtle the second (26:17 - 26:22)
best member of the original starters (26:19 - 26:26)
that's enough pinion movies written by a (26:22 - 26:29)
previous guest on it's super effective (26:26 - 26:31)
Allegra Frank yeah well he sins she is (26:29 - 26:34)
in some deep water now I'm calling you (26:31 - 26:35)
out (26:34 - 26:41)
Allegra elect you once on this program (26:35 - 26:43)
where we have some fighting words now (26:41 - 26:45)
actually squirtle is pretty great no (26:43 - 26:47)
one's debating yeah the best one not (26:45 - 26:50)
second but we'll deal why that's why (26:47 - 26:52)
there's a problem here oh the problem is (26:50 - 26:55)
she says second best but she doesn't say (26:52 - 26:57)
what number what her number one is I'm (26:55 - 27:01)
assuming it's a it's Charmander aerobics (26:57 - 27:02)
Bulbasaur (27:01 - 27:05)
oh that's not true oh you're going to (27:02 - 27:06)
get us in so much trouble there are (27:05 - 27:08)
people who love Bulbasaur they are not (27:06 - 27:10)
me but Bulbasaur is enjoyed by many (27:08 - 27:14)
people oh let's be let's be frank myself (27:10 - 27:17)
nobody liked my let's be allegra frank (27:14 - 27:21)
my saying no one likes Bulbasaur will (27:17 - 27:23)
get me in trouble with fewer people than (27:21 - 27:25)
if I had said no one likes Charmander or (27:23 - 27:28)
no one like squirrel that's then you'd (27:25 - 27:31)
be in a heat of trouble correct (27:28 - 27:35)
squirtle endpoint is proven squirtle (27:31 - 27:37)
look come in two separate sets the (27:35 - 27:39)
online only package includes a pre (27:37 - 27:42)
stuffed plush a sound chip filled with (27:39 - 27:46)
squirtle sounds a raincoat a hoodie (27:42 - 27:49)
inspired by an ultra ball annex and an (27:46 - 27:52)
exclusive pokemon card this bundle will (27:49 - 27:55)
cost $60 on build-a-bears website the (27:52 - 27:58)
raincoat and sound chip are only (27:55 - 28:01)
included with the web exclusive and the (27:58 - 28:04)
raincoat is pretty cute oh it's okay (28:01 - 28:07)
it's it's I kinda see through and it's a (28:04 - 28:09)
bunch of red palazzi cute it's really (28:07 - 28:11)
cute (28:09 - 28:13)
stuffed Pokemon fans who want to build (28:11 - 28:15)
their own squirtle can do so at the any (28:13 - 28:17)
of the workshop locations beginning in (28:15 - 28:18)
June (28:17 - 28:23)
wrong as a way yes she does she actually (28:18 - 28:26)
right stuffed Pokemon fans which is like (28:23 - 28:29)
the appropriate sentence would be like (28:26 - 28:33)
fans of stuffed Pokemon that's true not (28:29 - 28:35)
like the fans themselves are stuff don't (28:33 - 28:37)
usually just give you dinner you do (28:35 - 28:40)
stuff your your your your animals at (28:37 - 28:42)
build-a-bear you do this ya know but but (28:40 - 28:44)
but the term stuffed Pokemon fans dance (28:42 - 28:47)
it you could say I'm a Pokemon podcast (28:44 - 28:51)
fan but that doesn't mean I'm a podcast (28:47 - 28:53)
fan who is a Pokemon it just means I'm (28:51 - 28:53)
happy (28:53 - 28:56)
ah the great program it's a anyways what (28:53 - 28:58)
were you gonna say why should why is she (28:56 - 29:01)
wrong she says the unimaginable to bear (28:58 - 29:02)
they had a met Mayfair they had him at (29:01 - 29:04)
my mall I didn't walk in to build-a-bear (29:02 - 29:06)
I probably would have walked in if Irene (29:04 - 29:09)
was with me but I didn't want to walk (29:06 - 29:10)
Nadia how do you know it wasn't just (29:09 - 29:13)
like a display that was like a was it (29:10 - 29:15)
did you actually see the it was actually (29:13 - 29:16)
it was it was like squirt was like this (29:15 - 29:18)
the squirtle was like Center on a (29:16 - 29:22)
display in the store it could have been (29:18 - 29:24)
saying it could have been coming up he's (29:22 - 29:26)
walking in to build-a-bear on your own a (29:24 - 29:28)
threat to your masculinity no I've done (29:26 - 29:31)
it before but if I could hear you at (29:28 - 29:33)
this time here's my worry I would have (29:31 - 29:36)
walked in solo and I would have bought (29:33 - 29:38)
the squirtle (29:36 - 29:40)
and then Irene would have been mad at me (29:38 - 29:42)
that she wasn't with me when we stuffed (29:40 - 29:45)
said squirtle together and so ice is (29:42 - 29:47)
reasonable so I thought to myself if I'd (29:45 - 29:49)
if I just don't go in then there will be (29:47 - 29:54)
no stuffing to be had these squirrels (29:49 - 29:56)
will come with a special pokemon card (29:54 - 29:59)
they will cost $28 for the squirtle (29:56 - 30:02)
that of course is including any of the (29:59 - 30:04)
overpriced accessories squirtle is the (30:02 - 30:06)
fourth pokemon to be available at (30:04 - 30:10)
build-a-bear workshop Pikachu Eevee and (30:06 - 30:13)
our personal favorite Charmander so that (30:10 - 30:15)
that's her number one right there (30:13 - 30:17)
we eager we eagerly await Bulbasaur (30:15 - 30:19)
build-a-bear workshop to round out the (30:17 - 30:22)
collection not gonna happen yeah it can (30:19 - 30:25)
be what well Bulbasaur is on four legs (30:22 - 30:27)
well so is Evie though and they don't (30:25 - 30:29)
but it are bears (30:27 - 30:32)
like now but but the stumpy shape and (30:29 - 30:34)
roundness of the Bulbasaur they it's (30:32 - 30:36)
just a you it does not fit the bill to (30:34 - 30:38)
be what about what you know what else is (30:36 - 30:42)
round up like a teddy bear it's in their (30:38 - 30:44)
wheelhouse nothing with the likes of (30:42 - 30:47)
flower on the back you can't blow the (30:44 - 30:49)
stuffing in and inflate that the same (30:47 - 30:51)
way you can something that does not have (30:49 - 30:53)
an ornamental no there I don't know that (30:51 - 30:55)
how the technology of stuffin works (30:53 - 30:58)
Build A Bear build-a-bear have you built (30:55 - 31:01)
I think the scientists over at the (30:58 - 31:04)
build-a-bear corporation can figure it (31:01 - 31:06)
out if they can figure out how to like (31:04 - 31:10)
uh like they they they cracked the code (31:06 - 31:13)
on the on the My Little Ponies they've (31:10 - 31:15)
cracked the code on a variety of animals (31:13 - 31:17)
and fun creatures and they frag the code (31:15 - 31:21)
on a number of Pokemon before and I (31:17 - 31:24)
think I think Bulbasaur is not even a (31:21 - 31:26)
challenge for the great minds at the (31:24 - 31:29)
build-a-bear workshop frankly well they (31:26 - 31:32)
do have a Brachiosaurus but I would say (31:29 - 31:36)
I look at their build the bear stuffed (31:32 - 31:38)
Groot and then ask yourself again (31:36 - 31:40)
whether this is something you really (31:38 - 31:40)
want (31:40 - 31:42)
I refuse to because this is an audio (31:40 - 31:44)
program and I won't be participating in (31:42 - 31:46)
this thing that the two of you keep (31:44 - 31:48)
doing by commenting on the like rain (31:46 - 31:50)

a jacket it's the rain jacket bear no I (32:05 - 32:11)
thought you were saying I thought you're (32:09 - 32:13)
saying like a Groot I thought you were (32:11 - 32:14)
talking about the Groot still Oh get the (32:13 - 32:18)
Groot and Travis sighs no I said (32:14 - 32:23)
whatever you guys missing my nerds haha (32:18 - 32:26)
last bit of news here before we take a (32:23 - 32:28)
break I asked a question on Twitter I (32:26 - 32:29)
think we're gonna ask question once a (32:28 - 32:31)
week so we have something to go off of (32:29 - 32:33)
last week I asked if people were still (32:31 - 32:35)
playing Pokemon Sun and Moon we talked (32:33 - 32:36)
about that during the interview with Joe (32:35 - 32:40)
from Sarah B this week I asked if people (32:36 - 32:42)
were people were playing the Pokemon (32:40 - 32:43)
mobile games and which one they were (32:42 - 32:45)
playing the most choices between Pokemon (32:43 - 32:48)
shuffle Pokemon go and Pokemon dual (32:45 - 32:50)
figured I'd leave this up because I (32:48 - 32:52)
thought splash Magikarp was coming but I (32:50 - 32:56)
was wrong their results though are 16% (32:52 - 32:59)
of people prefer Pokemon shuffle 10% of (32:56 - 33:02)
people prefer Pokemon duel and a (32:59 - 33:06)
whopping 74% of people in prefer Pokemon (33:02 - 33:10)
go yeah and this just in water is wet (33:06 - 33:15)
like what Wow oh that's so harsh I'm (33:10 - 33:17)
kidding I'm sorry Steve it's a very good (33:15 - 33:19)
pool and you did a great job (33:17 - 33:20)
thank you thank you I did a great job (33:19 - 33:23)
you taking advantage of Twitter's API (33:20 - 33:27)
right I would assume that the people who (33:23 - 33:29)
like Pokemon shuffle and Pokemon duel (33:27 - 33:31)
more just don't go out of the house (33:29 - 33:35)
right that has to be the reason or they (33:31 - 33:37)
live in a place that's very very cold or (33:35 - 33:39)
they live in a place I guess I guess is (33:37 - 33:41)
still the same or they live in um the (33:39 - 33:43)
same thing or they just live in the (33:41 - 33:44)
middle of nowhere so even if they wanted (33:43 - 33:46)
to go somewhere there's still no poke (33:44 - 33:49)
stops right Pokemon shuffles really good (33:46 - 33:51)
I have yet to play pokemon duel it's (33:49 - 33:52)
alright (33:51 - 33:54)
no Fire Emblem right you still playing (33:52 - 33:59)
Fire Emblem of course that good (33:54 - 34:01)
Fire Emblem just came out yeah but it's (33:59 - 34:03)
not really it's on 3ds so it's not about (34:01 - 34:07)
an iOS or Android correct isn't there (34:03 - 34:09)
gonna be a switch one probably yeah (34:07 - 34:12)

yeah so why would you buy a less (34:25 - 34:33)
superior game all right with that sigh (34:27 - 34:34)

you aren't included within pokey masters (35:55 - 36:00)
I feel like I play pokemon more than (35:57 - 36:01)
both of you combined (36:00 - 36:04)

my friend Steve convinced me that not (36:51 - 36:55)
having cable anymore and saving all that (36:53 - 36:57)
money was gonna be a great choice and (36:55 - 36:59)
guess what I don't have cable anymore so (36:57 - 37:02)
no Disney XD for me and no no before you (36:59 - 37:04)
say I'm not paying $40 a month for (37:02 - 37:07)
PlayStation views so 30 days ago 30 (37:04 - 37:09)
it was 40 the last time I checked what (37:07 - 37:11)
is it like 38 95 (37:09 - 37:14)
no it's $29.99 I'll become sure if (37:11 - 37:16)
youdon't review just wanted Pokemon (37:14 - 37:19)
there would be a slightly cheaper way to (37:16 - 37:21)
do it like on iTunes or something nope (37:19 - 37:24)
hmm no it's like 30 dollars for like 12 (37:21 - 37:27)
episodes I'm not well it's the new one (37:24 - 37:29)
uh yeah (37:27 - 37:32)
like you can buy the season pass really (37:29 - 37:35)
okay I might actually do that huh nope (37:32 - 37:37)
no because the new ones really really (37:35 - 37:39)
good so I don't know it's not a good (37:37 - 37:42)
yeah I thought it was very kiddush you (37:39 - 37:45)
know but it's it's strange I had (37:42 - 37:47)
literally have people texting me and (37:45 - 37:49)
they're like they they're like oh I (37:47 - 37:51)
thought it was gonna be stupid but I'm (37:49 - 37:54)
all like sucked into it now that's that (37:51 - 37:55)
came from Zach from North Carolina if (37:54 - 37:58)
anybody is curious um so I mean out I'll (37:55 - 38:00)
take that dudes word for it I trust him (37:58 - 38:03)
alright I mean kiddush sure like it's (38:00 - 38:07)
it's a kids show and this iteration of (38:03 - 38:10)
it I think is doubling down on that but (38:07 - 38:14)
you can be a good kids show as I think (38:10 - 38:17)
this is shaping up to be there's a lot (38:14 - 38:19)
of funny jokes in it yeah but Pokemon (38:17 - 38:23)
has never been a good kids show it's (38:19 - 38:25)
always been a and now it and now it's (38:23 - 38:27)
approaching that way so get in whoa slow (38:25 - 38:30)
average yeah alright (38:27 - 38:31)
I ran you guys don't have this wait let (38:30 - 38:34)
me just and let me give you the informed (38:31 - 38:36)
viewpoint here the with the new (38:34 - 38:38)
direction that they're taking they have (38:36 - 38:41)
actually turned the show or brought the (38:38 - 38:46)
show closer to modern anime sort of (38:41 - 38:50)
drawing and sort of expressive features (38:46 - 38:53)
that are that you see in the the actual (38:50 - 38:55)
anime that you get from Japan as opposed (38:53 - 38:58)
to a highly westernized more trying to (38:55 - 39:00)
be Cartoon Network cartoon type thing I (38:58 - 39:02)
don't reject animation or how it looks (39:00 - 39:04)
has anything to do with the quality of (39:02 - 39:08)
the loot Leo does no absolutely it does (39:04 - 39:10)
absolutely not (39:08 - 39:13)
like I could watch a hot ma from 1980 (39:10 - 39:16)
and it could be poorly drawn but if it (39:13 - 39:18)
had a compelling enough story and it (39:16 - 39:21)
wasn't the same thing of (39:18 - 39:23)
Asch discovers a new pokemon team rocket (39:21 - 39:25)
shows up and something and tries to (39:23 - 39:27)
steal that pokemon they blast Team (39:25 - 39:29)
Rocket off Ashe refuses to catch said (39:27 - 39:32)
new pokemon and continues on with his (39:29 - 39:35)
journey every single episode yeah what (39:32 - 39:38)
that not I want not what I'm saying what (39:35 - 39:40)
I'm saying it is everything I said right (39:38 - 39:41)
there has nothing to do with the (39:40 - 39:43)
animation you can change it could be the (39:41 - 39:45)
best animated Pokemon show of the world (39:43 - 39:48)
but if it still has those four bullet (39:45 - 39:51)
points which it's had for 21 years I'm (39:48 - 39:53)
not interested well that's not true (39:51 - 39:56)
either but you can't divorce the (39:53 - 39:59)
animation style from the the the whole (39:56 - 40:01)
core of evaluating what the quality of (39:59 - 40:05)
the anime is and now you've completely (40:01 - 40:09)
made me forget what oh yeah buzz I'm (40:05 - 40:11)
just saying it's better because it's (40:09 - 40:14)
become more artistic in and more towards (40:11 - 40:18)
modern preferences in animation in the (40:14 - 40:21)
actual world of anime the what I would (40:18 - 40:24)
what I would say is that the way that (40:21 - 40:26)
television medium works and specifically (40:24 - 40:28)
the way the animated medium works is (40:26 - 40:31)
that atmosphere or the tone of the show (40:28 - 40:36)
is a result of both the writing and the (40:31 - 40:40)
animation right so the writing calls for (40:36 - 40:43)
the animators to create images of (40:40 - 40:46)
certain physical jokes or like you know (40:43 - 40:48)
physical comedy of things bunking into (40:46 - 40:51)
each other or or whatever and then the (40:48 - 40:54)
animation iterates on that it creates an (40:51 - 40:57)
iteration of it and then that informs (40:54 - 40:59)
further writing once the style has been (40:57 - 41:03)
nailed down by the animation then the (40:59 - 41:04)
writing doubles down on that style and (41:03 - 41:07)
it creates a sort of synergistic loop (41:04 - 41:10)
that the the function of which is sort (41:07 - 41:12)
of that the tone of the show so I think (41:10 - 41:14)
I'm with will here that it's difficult (41:12 - 41:17)
to disentangle those two elements from (41:14 - 41:21)
one another I have only so I saw the (41:17 - 41:22)
first two episodes and then I saw (41:21 - 41:26)
episode 3 an episode 3 fits the same (41:22 - 41:30)
exact medium the same exact flow as the (41:26 - 41:34)
last 20 years which was ashen company (41:30 - 41:34)
disco (41:34 - 41:38)
from me McHugh team rocket shows up make (41:34 - 41:40)
you hate speak at you because that's its (41:38 - 41:44)
gimmick team rocket blasts off again ash (41:40 - 41:47)
does not catch mimic you end of episode (41:44 - 41:50)
exactly i honest mimic you is really (41:47 - 41:51)
hard to catch (41:50 - 41:54)
no but it's regardless that is the same (41:51 - 41:56)
thing that has happened for the last 21 (41:54 - 41:57)
years (41:56 - 41:59)
every episode they introduce a new (41:57 - 42:01)
pokemon and every episode Team Rocket (41:59 - 42:03)
interviewers and every episode ash (42:01 - 42:05)
doesn't catch that new Pokemon but (42:03 - 42:06)
you're not the target audience for this (42:05 - 42:08)
right like children are and children (42:06 - 42:11)
like to see stories where they can (42:08 - 42:14)
expect what's gonna happen yeah actually (42:11 - 42:18)
joy but yeah you know it is incredibly (42:14 - 42:20)
true watch any episode of Power Rangers (42:18 - 42:22)
every single episode of that show is (42:20 - 42:24)
precisely the same except for the few (42:22 - 42:26)
times that they get into the Megazord or (42:24 - 42:27)
whatever it's called and they're not (42:26 - 42:28)
able to defeat the giant monster and (42:27 - 42:29)
then they need some other superpower (42:28 - 42:31)
from space or whatever that comes and it (42:29 - 42:32)
gives them that additional power to (42:31 - 42:33)
defeat the giant monster other than (42:32 - 42:36)
those few instances every episode of the (42:33 - 42:38)
Power Rangers is there are some minions (42:36 - 42:41)
that they fight outside of the suit then (42:38 - 42:42)
they go into the suit and there's a (42:41 - 42:45)
monster and they beat it off but then it (42:42 - 42:47)
gets giant and then they can't fight it (42:45 - 42:50)
in their suits so then yeah have you (42:47 - 42:51)
ever seen another set of Power Rangers (42:50 - 42:53)
that they always wear in the monsters (42:51 - 42:55)
like said I know exactly what you're (42:53 - 42:57)
saying s what is a and you wanna keep (42:55 - 43:00)
going okay counterpoint what did you (42:57 - 43:02)
Digimon does not have that same flow and (43:00 - 43:04)
Digimon was definitely more human (43:02 - 43:06)
absolutely has that sound for you (43:04 - 43:08)
kidding me no it does not (43:06 - 43:11)
mati will go on and then where we get (43:08 - 43:14)
into some other world and like it's too (43:11 - 43:16)
overwhelming for me and my character and (43:14 - 43:18)
my Digimon Digimon to something bigger (43:16 - 43:19)
to help us we're getting we're getting (43:18 - 43:21)
too far we're getting too from not far (43:19 - 43:23)
from the point the point is it doesn't (43:21 - 43:25)
matter whether or not this is every (43:23 - 43:27)
single children's program what matters (43:25 - 43:28)
is that this is an established thing (43:27 - 43:32)
that as that is successful and it does (43:28 - 43:34)
work and children like they'd like to (43:32 - 43:37)
see repetition in story that that's a (43:34 - 43:41)
tactic that Pokemon has chosen to employ (43:37 - 43:44)
and throughout its history and I don't (43:41 - 43:47)
think necessarily that just because that (43:44 - 43:48)
style of (43:47 - 43:50)
storytelling doesn't appeal to you (43:48 - 43:51)
specifically I don't think that (43:50 - 43:55)
necessarily means that your claim is (43:51 - 43:57)
warranted that I mean that it's a bad (43:55 - 43:59)
show for that I think it just means that (43:57 - 44:02)
you don't want to see that and that's (43:59 - 44:04)
like okay but I don't think that is any (44:02 - 44:06)
I don't think that says anything poorly (44:04 - 44:09)
about Pokemon or what it does because it (44:06 - 44:11)
does what it does well and that's kind (44:09 - 44:13)
of all I personally ask of media is if (44:11 - 44:16)
it's if it sets out a goal that is (44:13 - 44:19)
admirable and then Chiefs that goal then (44:16 - 44:22)
like good it great perfect two more (44:19 - 44:23)
examples is Steven universe doesn't (44:22 - 44:27)
follow that and myelin Steven universe (44:23 - 44:29)
is not for children okay (44:27 - 44:32)
sure plenty of kids love Steven universe (44:29 - 44:35)
well they're wrong you can't you can't (44:32 - 44:38)
like I said like I said my point is go (44:35 - 44:41)
ahead the point isn't that the point I'm (44:38 - 44:42)
trying to make is not that every (44:41 - 44:44)
children's program does this but that a (44:42 - 44:48)
lot of them do and a lot of children (44:44 - 44:50)
like those programs that do do it it's (44:48 - 44:52)
an established method of storytelling (44:50 - 44:55)
whether or not to us adult it seems (44:52 - 44:57)
repetitive is sort of irrelevant because (44:55 - 44:59)
we're not the target audience for that I (44:57 - 45:00)
think it is still possible for us to (44:59 - 45:03)
watch it and say sure it's repetitive (45:00 - 45:07)
but then again I'm not I'm not the (45:03 - 45:08)
target audience for this and I think if (45:07 - 45:10)
I were the target audience I would (45:08 - 45:14)
probably enjoy this my point is I'm sick (45:10 - 45:18)
of every single year that that everyone (45:14 - 45:20)
keeps telling me that oh the Pokemon (45:18 - 45:22)
anime gets so much better every single (45:20 - 45:24)
year I hear that oh it's better than (45:22 - 45:25)
last year it's better than last year and (45:24 - 45:28)
then I go does it follow the same format (45:25 - 45:31)
that it does year after year well yeah (45:28 - 45:33)
but it's still better no that's not (45:31 - 45:36)
better it's just the same I think I am (45:33 - 45:39)
in they're all sick with 20 years of (45:36 - 45:42)
team rocket and and ash encountering one (45:39 - 45:44)
new Pokemon in episode and not actually (45:42 - 45:48)
doing anything worthwhile with that with (45:44 - 45:50)
that instance there are an infinite (45:48 - 45:52)
amount of ways in which something can (45:50 - 45:56)
improve that have nothing to do with (45:52 - 45:58)
see aureate the stuff yeah the plotline (45:56 - 46:00)
why am i watching if there's no suppose (45:58 - 46:03)
you enjoy the battle scenes because you (46:00 - 46:06)
enjoy the the animation style because (46:03 - 46:08)
you enjoy the particular blend of (46:06 - 46:11)
character ages at this time because you (46:08 - 46:13)
think Cylons really cool and his you (46:11 - 46:16)
know love of collecting stamps Euler (46:13 - 46:19)
stylish is not cool silent is awesome so (46:16 - 46:23)
whatever the best parts of the anime is (46:19 - 46:26)
when Ash is at a tournament and does (46:23 - 46:29)
battles after battles and even those (46:26 - 46:31)
even those like even an XYZ that (46:29 - 46:33)
tournament was really lackluster (46:31 - 46:36)
compared to tournaments in the past if (46:33 - 46:38)
all that truly mattered was the (46:36 - 46:40)
storyline no one would ever do anything (46:38 - 46:42)
other than read books but surprised it's (46:40 - 46:44)
not true at all there's so many shows (46:42 - 46:48)
that are storyline based cartoon or not (46:44 - 46:51)
yes correct but if it were the case that (46:48 - 46:55)
people only wanted storyline there would (46:51 - 46:57)
be no reason to have any visual element (46:55 - 46:59)
no no production company would waste the (46:57 - 47:00)
amount of money it takes to make a movie (46:59 - 47:03)
or a TV show if all people wanted to do (47:00 - 47:05)
was see a plot progress because then (47:03 - 47:06)
everyone would just buy books but they (47:05 - 47:10)
don't they want to see fascinating (47:06 - 47:12)
spectacle portrayed on screen in (47:10 - 47:17)
addition married to and being and (47:12 - 47:19)
interacting with story so I think it's (47:17 - 47:23)
kind of bizarre that the major claim is (47:19 - 47:25)
that your claim is nothing but the story (47:23 - 47:27)
matters that is why I just I just (47:25 - 47:28)
thought of a great parallel right (47:27 - 47:32)
scooby-doo literally did the same thing (47:28 - 47:35)
week after we and and so you answer you (47:32 - 47:37)
got and so did Power Rangers like we've (47:35 - 47:39)
established that and you know what I (47:37 - 47:41)
read or what I don't watch Scooby Doo (47:39 - 47:43)
okay so we what we've established is (47:41 - 47:46)
you're the one with the problem and the (47:43 - 47:48)
rest of the world is fine yes you are (47:46 - 47:49)
right I am the only single person that (47:48 - 47:52)
hates the Pokemon anime minus the (47:49 - 47:53)
frequent amount of listeners that tell (47:52 - 47:55)
us not to talk about anime because it's (47:53 - 47:57)
boring or the other half the spectrum (47:55 - 47:59)
that one is to talk about more anime (47:57 - 48:00)
because they're interested but what is (47:59 - 48:02)
there to talk about Oh what was the (48:00 - 48:04)
Pokemon this week mimic you Oh what (48:02 - 48:05)
happened well you know team rocky got (48:04 - 48:08)
involved like they have for the last 21 (48:05 - 48:09)
years (48:08 - 48:11)
okay where where's the talking points on (48:09 - 48:14)
that the indo-iranian with listeners (48:11 - 48:16)
interesting way in which beware come out (48:14 - 48:19)
of nowhere to uh to save Team Rocket I (48:16 - 48:22)
mean I would I would enjoy a segment of (48:19 - 48:23)
this program where it's just someone (48:22 - 48:26)
telling me how be where did a funny (48:23 - 48:28)
thing in rescuing Team Rocket this week (48:26 - 48:31)
that would bring me endless joy remember (48:28 - 48:34)
when everyone loved Pokemon organs huh I (48:31 - 48:36)
wonder why oh because it actually told (48:34 - 48:39)
the story you know what doesn't tell an (48:36 - 48:42)
actual story the anime you know what (48:39 - 48:44)
else other people loved that youtube (48:42 - 48:46)
series do you know why because it wasn't (48:44 - 48:48)
the same thing each one of those (48:46 - 48:52)
episodes told a story right but the the (48:48 - 48:54)
reason more people we know like those (48:52 - 48:56)
things is because those are targeted for (48:54 - 48:59)
people that whose ages are closer to our (48:56 - 49:01)
ages okay so then why are why are you (48:59 - 49:03)
guys saying that the anime is better (49:01 - 49:05)
when it's the same thing and when it's (49:03 - 49:08)
not it's not it's better at already in (49:05 - 49:11)
the history of the anime it has made a (49:08 - 49:13)
progression and that progression is an (49:11 - 49:15)
improvement at the program is if the (49:13 - 49:17)
progression is only like the art style (49:15 - 49:19)
like that's still not a progression it (49:17 - 49:21)
just means they hired a different team I (49:19 - 49:24)
mean like I really disagree with with (49:21 - 49:27)
that claim right there that a that in an (49:24 - 49:31)
improvement in like improvements in (49:27 - 49:33)
areas other than storyline like those (49:31 - 49:36)
matter to me like I'm fine conceding (49:33 - 49:40)
that the storyline itself is cyclical (49:36 - 49:41)
the same (49:40 - 49:46)
sure I'm fine conceding that I I just (49:41 - 49:48)
happen to appreciate improvements in (49:46 - 49:52)
other areas and if overall like most of (49:48 - 49:55)
the areas of the that you could discuss (49:52 - 49:57)
about the anime have improved that I'm (49:55 - 49:59)
going to say that the anime has improved (49:57 - 50:02)
look I know that the anime is nothing (49:59 - 50:05)
but a commercial for Pokemon it's (50:02 - 50:06)
nothing (50:05 - 50:08)
but to sell games to sell trading cards (50:06 - 50:11)
to sell merchandise that's all it exists (50:08 - 50:13)
for I get I do not I do not disagree all (50:11 - 50:17)
I'm asking is for when somebody says the (50:13 - 50:20)
anime is better than it was last year is (50:17 - 50:24)
for me to watch it and go oh look it (50:20 - 50:26)
they finally broke the formula they've (50:24 - 50:29)
stuck to but better doesn't necessarily (50:26 - 50:30)
mean broke the formula like when someone (50:29 - 50:31)
says you know anime ever gotten (50:30 - 50:32)
satisfied (50:31 - 50:34)
yeah when someone says the anime is (50:32 - 50:36)
better don't expect it to be different (50:34 - 50:39)
like a completely different show look at (50:36 - 50:42)
me that's not better like I want well I (50:39 - 50:44)
want that's what we're discovering here (50:42 - 50:46)
right now is that your your your (50:44 - 50:48)
standards are quite different than are (50:46 - 50:50)
the people who are telling you the anime (50:48 - 50:51)
is better you are looking for very (50:50 - 50:53)
different things than they are (50:51 - 50:56)
I would I would also argue that like the (50:53 - 51:00)
the first season had somewhat of I look (50:56 - 51:03)
forward to next week and I would even (51:00 - 51:05)
argue that the orange island season had (51:03 - 51:06)
something where it was like I look (51:05 - 51:10)
forward to next week it for me it is (51:06 - 51:15)
hard to watch XYZ black and white black (51:10 - 51:17)
and white to whatever because I've seen (51:15 - 51:19)
almost all those episodes and I even put (51:17 - 51:21)
on a random episode of diamond and pearl (51:19 - 51:24)
like two weeks ago and that's when we (51:21 - 51:25)
discovered the Bidoof fiasco (51:24 - 51:29)
I just find it frustrating that when I (51:25 - 51:31)
finish any of those episodes whether (51:29 - 51:34)
it's black and white XY (51:31 - 51:37)
alala that it doesn't feel like they're (51:34 - 51:42)
setting up to the viewer there's no like (51:37 - 51:44)
cliffhanger there's no getting excited (51:42 - 51:47)
for next week I will agree with you that (51:44 - 51:49)
given the standards that you have laid (51:47 - 51:51)
out like given your standards if you (51:49 - 51:53)
want to see different stories told you (51:51 - 51:55)
want to have something that (51:53 - 51:57)
that pulls you towards wanting to watch (51:55 - 51:59)
another episode if those are your (51:57 - 52:00)
standards the Pokemon anime is terrible (51:59 - 52:03)
but those are not the standards to which (52:00 - 52:06)
the Pokemon anime is playing so I'm (52:03 - 52:08)
going to look at the essentially the (52:06 - 52:11)
criteria by which the Pokemon anime (52:08 - 52:14)
judges itself and and try to judge it by (52:11 - 52:16)
that criteria and if I see that it's (52:14 - 52:17)
improving in those criteria I'll say (52:16 - 52:20)
that it's improving and when people do (52:17 - 52:22)
the same I just don't think you should (52:20 - 52:25)
expect that the anime has specifically (52:22 - 52:27)
catered itself to you Steve black jr. (52:25 - 52:30)
it's what matters the most is when they (52:27 - 52:33)
cater to me perfect but this is why we (52:30 - 52:34)
hit this is why we have bad anime is (52:33 - 52:37)
because everyone's just so complacent (52:34 - 52:39)
with it oh that's all I've done it for (52:37 - 52:41)
21 years who cares if they keep doing it (52:39 - 52:43)
like no it's been around for 20 years (52:41 - 52:46)
probably now is the time to change it I (52:43 - 52:48)
would venture to say that the new anime (52:46 - 52:50)
is not bad there are a lot of points in (52:48 - 52:52)
which the anime has been bad but I enjoy (52:50 - 52:54)
myself watching the new anime I laugh a (52:52 - 52:56)
lot more than I have in previous seasons (52:54 - 52:58)
I find myself in drawing the spectacles (52:56 - 53:00)
portrayed on screen ways that I haven't (52:58 - 53:01)
in other seasons and I find myself (53:00 - 53:03)
enjoying more of the characters than I (53:01 - 53:05)
have in previous seasons to me that is a (53:03 - 53:07)
market improvement to something that is (53:05 - 53:10)
not a bad anime and don't we all just (53:07 - 53:12)
need more laughter in this day and age (53:10 - 53:14)
no that's why people listen to the show (53:12 - 53:16)
yeah that's why we that's why we are (53:14 - 53:19)
that's why we got legitimately angry at (53:16 - 53:22)
each other in the last 20 minutes I will (53:19 - 53:24)
continue watching the Aloha series I (53:22 - 53:26)
think they're on what episode for now so (53:24 - 53:29)
I'm one episode behind maybe episode 5 I (53:26 - 53:31)
can't remember but I've been watching (53:29 - 53:33)
the sub so I don't know where we are (53:31 - 53:35)
I think Disney XD is on episode 4 or 5 (53:33 - 53:39)
I'll continue watching it but it's the (53:35 - 53:42)
same thing yeah but just if you if you (53:39 - 53:44)
continue to watch it don't expect it to (53:42 - 53:46)
be different just try and enjoy the (53:44 - 53:51)
jokes enjoy the colors enjoy the Q (53:46 - 53:53)
Pokemon and enjoy the people don't (53:51 - 53:56)
expect it to I feel like everything (53:53 - 53:58)
I said would fit perfectly if you were (53:56 - 54:03)
pitching that to will III sold take my (53:58 - 54:06)
$12 Apple I'm what I am in what I'm (54:03 - 54:08)
saying like what I'm saying is the (54:06 - 54:12)
Pokemon anime is not geared towards the (54:08 - 54:14)
set of standards that you have towards (54:12 - 54:16)
the Pokemon anime so you might consider (54:14 - 54:18)
adjusting your expectations there's a (54:16 - 54:21)
lot of anime out there I don't know what (54:18 - 54:25)
that means and yeah just ignore that I (54:21 - 54:28)
only got time for so much in my life our (54:25 - 54:30)
boys is the best anime of the year which (54:28 - 54:33)
one don't it's it's a there's a polygon (54:30 - 54:35)
youtube series called car boys that (54:33 - 54:37)
eventually kind of just evolved into an (54:35 - 54:40)
anime and I love it it's not anime at (54:37 - 54:43)
all but it's really good yeah I mean (54:40 - 54:46)
watching blue exorcist so do you (54:43 - 54:47)
recommend from Will Anderson right there (54:46 - 54:51)
did you love you infidelity Steve no I (54:47 - 54:55)
have it yet oh you have to watch it then (54:51 - 54:56)
we have to talk about it off the show (54:55 - 54:57)
all right good (54:56 - 55:00)
I will I'll probably watch it on Monday (54:57 - 55:01)
when I'm at work and not actually (55:00 - 55:04)
working let's actually get to wills (55:01 - 55:05)
question now that we got the anime off (55:04 - 55:07)
the table (55:05 - 55:11)
so this is will from Knoxville Tennessee (55:07 - 55:13)
hey Pokemon masters in spj I hope (55:11 - 55:16)
everyone is I hope everyone's day is (55:13 - 55:20)
going great so far it was up until about (55:16 - 55:24)
10 minutes ago well as I'm far away from (55:20 - 55:27)
my mic and I still max it out I'm sorry (55:24 - 55:29)
Steve will is my favorite but I really (55:27 - 55:31)
love all you people (55:29 - 55:34)
I forgot what episode but spj said (55:31 - 55:36)
something of well here we go (55:34 - 55:38)
as I said something but actually takes (55:36 - 55:41)
it something really ignorant so let me (55:38 - 55:42)
explain (55:41 - 55:44)
look I am sure there's plenty of people (55:42 - 55:46)
who agree with me on the anime front I (55:44 - 55:49)
would argue that most of our listeners (55:46 - 55:51)
don't watch the anime for the reason for (55:49 - 55:54)
the same reasons I I do I think you're (55:51 - 55:55)
certainly correct on the point that (55:54 - 55:57)
people agree with you I think you're (55:55 - 55:58)
correct on the point the majority of our (55:57 - 56:01)
listeners don't watch the anime but I (55:58 - 56:03)
would say that if someone has the same (56:01 - 56:05)
opinion of you regardless of whether or (56:03 - 56:06)
not they're in the majority they are (56:05 - 56:07)
incorrect (56:06 - 56:11)
I would I would not say that I would say (56:07 - 56:13)
that people like to get daniel's (56:11 - 56:15)
question please know we're now we got to (56:13 - 56:17)
go off the rails before we get to well I (56:15 - 56:19)
will just say fun let's just look at (56:17 - 56:21)
that I have high standards for what I (56:19 - 56:23)
want my Pokemon anime are not anime I (56:21 - 56:26)
forgot what episode spj said something (56:23 - 56:29)
about how mid-tier Pokemon don't get any (56:26 - 56:33)
love I think Wartortle was an example I (56:29 - 56:35)
hate that these Pokemon get overlooked (56:33 - 56:37)
so often I was thinking why don't they (56:35 - 56:40)
give a middle evolution a mega form give (56:37 - 56:43)
me a mega Metapod give me a mega Selo (56:40 - 56:46)
do you have any other ideas on how the (56:43 - 56:49)
middle evolution tiers can get get hype (56:46 - 56:51)
and used in the games because Evo light (56:49 - 56:55)
clearly is not doing that Evo light is (56:51 - 56:56)
clearly not doing that thanks for all (56:55 - 56:58)
the hard work will for maxvill tennessee (56:56 - 57:01)
i mean eat the light is doing alright (56:58 - 57:03)
right like porygon - is one of the most (57:01 - 57:06)
important pokemon in the meta and that's (57:03 - 57:08)
because of evo light so I mean porygon (57:06 - 57:11)
to its usage way more than port Aegon Z (57:08 - 57:13)
so to some extent heavy lights doing its (57:11 - 57:15)
job but it only does its job for Pokemon (57:13 - 57:18)
that are already have the stat and move (57:15 - 57:23)
cool to be bulky walls so you only get (57:18 - 57:24)
stuff like Chansey (57:23 - 57:28)
porygon to using it generally oh I I (57:24 - 57:31)
don't I don't know that you're really (57:28 - 57:35)
going to I don't know that any like real (57:31 - 57:37)
solution to this is going to be (57:35 - 57:38)
satisfying because even if you go to the (57:37 - 57:41)
port again to example now it's just like (57:38 - 57:43)
ok porygon - is the one that's better (57:41 - 57:46)
than porygon z so now it's just oh ok so (57:43 - 57:48)
for that line it's just everyone cares (57:46 - 57:51)
about this one and not that one so it (57:48 - 57:53)
the way pokemon works is like one (57:51 - 57:55)
pokemon in a line is going to be better (57:53 - 57:58)
than all the others and that's the one (57:55 - 58:01)
that gets usage with the exception of (57:58 - 58:04)
pokemon with split evolutions and (58:01 - 58:04)
I'm not going to cry too many tears for (58:05 - 58:10)
all of (58:07 - 58:14)
you know all of the like quilladin 'z of (58:10 - 58:15)
the world that aren't getting used like (58:14 - 58:18)
it's kind of just the nature the way the (58:15 - 58:22)
game is structured to me well so you've (58:18 - 58:24)
got to understand what the purpose of (58:22 - 58:26)
the middle evolutions are and I would (58:24 - 58:29)
say that their purpose is when you are (58:26 - 58:31)
playing the story right (58:29 - 58:33)
their purpose is not for competitive (58:31 - 58:34)
their purpose is so that when you're (58:33 - 58:36)
playing the story it maintains your (58:34 - 58:39)
interest as you're at the midpoint of (58:36 - 58:41)
the story that you're not just using (58:39 - 58:45)
that first evolution for 30 or 40 levels (58:41 - 58:48)
it's like you hit level 20 you hit level (58:45 - 58:51)
25 oh hey I've got a new Pokemon to keep (58:48 - 58:53)
me going for a little while longer you (58:51 - 58:55)
know and so you got that interest it's (58:53 - 58:57)
something you're working through as part (58:55 - 59:00)
of the story um and I think that's (58:57 - 59:02)
literally their only purpose that (59:00 - 59:04)
they're they're not intended to be (59:02 - 59:06)
competitive they're not intended to be (59:04 - 59:09)
an end game type Pokemon and they just (59:06 - 59:11)
sort of are in there to carry you (59:09 - 59:13)
through so that you have something (59:11 - 59:16)
different to work with as you keep going (59:13 - 59:18)
through the story that's why I actually (59:16 - 59:21)
feel like in later generations there's (59:18 - 59:23)
been fewer of them just because people (59:21 - 59:26)
rush through the story so fast they (59:23 - 59:28)
don't need that midpoint to sort of (59:26 - 59:31)
maintain interest and say what am I (59:28 - 59:32)
going to have in the middle all right (59:31 - 59:34)
and then what am I going to have at the (59:32 - 59:35)
end it's kind of like well I'm already (59:34 - 59:38)
working towards an endgame Pokemon I (59:35 - 59:39)
don't really care about what comes (59:38 - 59:40)
before it anymore (59:39 - 59:42)
I hadn't thought about that trend I'd be (59:40 - 59:43)
interested to do you know for a fact (59:42 - 59:44)
that that's the case that they have (59:43 - 59:46)
fewer middle evolutions now than they (59:44 - 59:49)
did in previous generations well in all (59:46 - 59:52)
the time I just spent you bleeding by (59:49 - 59:58)
you know an intimate latex is very (59:52 - 60:01)
anecdotal but they you know literally (59:58 - 60:03)
towards the end of the Pokedex they're (60:01 - 60:07)
the only triple evolution is vanillite (60:03 - 60:11)
to vanilluxe but you know you have to (60:07 - 60:12)
think like the majority of the ones (60:11 - 60:14)
towards the end there even are like (60:12 - 60:16)
snubbull to granbull gastro Don but (60:14 - 60:18)
actually but you can't even get those (60:16 - 60:19)
yet to breed those - there's a new (60:18 - 60:22)
Pokemon though basics I would I would (60:19 - 60:24)
those aren't new Pokemon though like (60:22 - 60:26)
you're in so if you're gonna say that I (60:24 - 60:28)
who has three evolutions besides picky (60:26 - 60:30)
Peck via volt (60:28 - 60:32)
all right that's another one but okay so (60:30 - 60:34)
these are your carry through the story (60:32 - 60:37)
ones but are you getting tons and tons (60:34 - 60:39)
of triple evolution ones or are sort of (60:37 - 60:42)
you is the glut of the Pokedex mostly (60:39 - 60:45)
two evolutions at most we'll have to do (60:42 - 60:46)
a scientific study of this and get back (60:45 - 60:49)
to it I mean I would say that not all (60:46 - 60:52)
Pokemon are built to be competitive like (60:49 - 60:55)
look at something like corsola like (60:52 - 60:56)
definitely not going to see any (60:55 - 60:59)
competitive action if Pokemon wanted to (60:56 - 61:03)
honor middle evolutions they could do a (60:59 - 61:06)
tournament unofficial tournament where (61:03 - 61:07)
you could only use middle evolutions I (61:06 - 61:10)
feel like they feel like they might have (61:07 - 61:12)
done something like that in the past I (61:10 - 61:15)
know in the TCG they had the tournament (61:12 - 61:17)
where you could only use cards that (61:15 - 61:19)
could evolve into something you could (61:17 - 61:22)
never do final evolutions yeah maybe a (61:19 - 61:24)
bound sweet by the way also has three (61:22 - 61:26)
evolutions the other thing they could do (61:24 - 61:28)
is just make more items like Evo Lite (61:26 - 61:31)
just make them do different things and (61:28 - 61:33)
only apply to non fully evolved Pokemon (61:31 - 61:35)
I don't know what whatever are the rules (61:33 - 61:38)
for evo light if it evolves if it has (61:35 - 61:40)
the capability to evolve its defense and (61:38 - 61:43)
special defense increase by a factor of (61:40 - 61:47)
I believe 1.5 times yeah yeah if you're (61:43 - 61:49)
holding if you light a visa yes those (61:47 - 61:50)
are the same thing if it evolves you (61:49 - 61:52)
know double if it valves but you haven't (61:50 - 61:55)
evolved it double at speed Jang mo o (61:52 - 61:58)
also has three evolutions or two more (61:55 - 62:01)
however you want to say that I an Eevee (61:58 - 62:02)
light for speed would be very (62:01 - 62:05)
interesting you'd get a lot of like I (62:02 - 62:07)
feel like that would get you a lot of (62:05 - 62:10)
like you would have murkrow with evo (62:07 - 62:12)
light because it gets prankster so you'd (62:10 - 62:15)
have a lot of these like support Pokemon (62:12 - 62:16)
but because I mean obviously they (62:15 - 62:18)
they're offensive stats are probably not (62:16 - 62:20)
gonna be as good as their evolved form (62:18 - 62:23)
but maybe their ability or move pool is (62:20 - 62:26)
supportive of some sort of support set (62:23 - 62:28)
that'd be interesting or I guess you (62:26 - 62:29)
wouldn't it with murkrow no Who am I (62:28 - 62:31)
kidding it RDS prankster stop listening (62:29 - 62:34)
to me no one should listen to me ever (62:31 - 62:36)
but great more items like that (62:34 - 62:40)
help without like changing Pokemon or or (62:36 - 62:44)
whatnot if you just introduced two more (62:40 - 62:45)
items that are similar to how Evo light (62:44 - 62:49)
acts I think that would help (62:45 - 62:53)
eleven golem also as three doodle olan (62:49 - 62:56)
olan going through the Pokedex in this (62:53 - 62:58)
is still not a scientific study here hey (62:56 - 62:59)
I'm just pointing out the threes because (62:58 - 63:02)
pika Peck and what whatever other one (62:59 - 63:05)
was the only ones we could think of ah (63:02 - 63:07)
next email is from Lindsey from Dallas (63:05 - 63:11)
Texas hello super effective cast I am a (63:07 - 63:13)
fairly new listener having found this (63:11 - 63:16)
podcast only a month ago and I'm really (63:13 - 63:18)
enjoying the LAT the few episodes I've (63:16 - 63:21)
listened to so far it's recounted my (63:18 - 63:22)
right now you have to be introduced to (63:21 - 63:24)
me (63:22 - 63:27)
it's rekindled my love for pokémon as I (63:24 - 63:30)
fell out of the loop not long after the (63:27 - 63:32)
beginning of generation two and has (63:30 - 63:34)
brought a memory back to me that I (63:32 - 63:37)
haven't thought of in years back when (63:34 - 63:40)
Pokemon was still new to the u.s. I had (63:37 - 63:42)
brought my Game Boy Color and my copy of (63:40 - 63:44)
Pokemon blue to school to play during (63:42 - 63:46)
our breaks between classes not realizing (63:44 - 63:50)
that I made another kid upset only days (63:46 - 63:52)
before and thus having them steal my (63:50 - 63:55)
gameboy and erase my file which would (63:52 - 63:57)
which normally wouldn't have been a big (63:55 - 63:59)
deal it just meant I got to play pokemon (63:57 - 64:01)
the game except it also erased my Mewtwo (63:59 - 64:03)
which at the time could only be attained (64:01 - 64:06)
by obtained through attending a (64:03 - 64:10)
tournament maybe ammu I feel like mute (64:06 - 64:11)
of MU because you could get Mewtwo in (64:10 - 64:14)
cerulean cave so getting the tape is (64:11 - 64:17)
that the cave yes then Mewtwo is in I (64:14 - 64:18)
think so (64:17 - 64:20)
yeah definitely mute but who knows (64:18 - 64:22)
needless to say this memory still (64:20 - 64:24)
saddens me knowing that I'll never get (64:22 - 64:26)
my Mewtwo back again my question for all (64:24 - 64:29)
of you is have you ever had a savefile (64:26 - 64:32)
loss or corrupted and lost a Pokemon you (64:29 - 64:35)
may never have gotten back Lindsey my (64:32 - 64:39)
answer is no in a manner of speaking yes (64:35 - 64:43)
the what I can't remember if it was my (64:39 - 64:46)
cartridge for silver or my cartridge for (64:43 - 64:49)
crystal I believe it was my sis I think (64:46 - 64:54)
it was the silver cartridge that I lost (64:49 - 64:57)
and never saw again and had a lot of (64:54 - 64:59)
Pokemon I cared about on it (64:57 - 65:01)
generation 2 you was (64:59 - 65:04)
the only generation for which I had (65:01 - 65:08)
every game I had gold silver and crystal (65:04 - 65:11)
and pretty much all of my favorite (65:08 - 65:13)
Pokemon were on whichever cartridge it (65:11 - 65:15)
was that I ended up losing so that was a (65:13 - 65:17)
bummer uh yeah kind of similar story to (65:15 - 65:21)
Travis I lost my copy of Pokemon blue (65:17 - 65:25)
well after I outgrown Pokemon but I had (65:21 - 65:28)
I had all the Pokemon I was the only (65:25 - 65:30)
game I got the little like trainer (65:28 - 65:32)
certificate for completing your pokedex (65:30 - 65:35)
uh and when I actually started caring (65:32 - 65:38)
about Pokemon again I went to look for (65:35 - 65:39)
it and I couldn't find it and I found my (65:38 - 65:42)
sister's copy of Pokemon red which (65:39 - 65:44)
should have been in the same place as my (65:42 - 65:46)
copy but yeah I have to this day I've (65:44 - 65:48)
never found my copy of blue not that it (65:46 - 65:50)
would matter because you can't transfer (65:48 - 65:52)
this Pokemon anyways uh it would just be (65:50 - 65:54)
nice to have the physical cartridge (65:52 - 65:56)
still since that's where at least it (65:54 - 66:01)
started for me um my sister Sara she had (65:56 - 66:05)
a copy of platinum that she like dropped (66:01 - 66:08)
in a puddle of water on like a table or (66:05 - 66:10)
something or like a spill happened and (66:08 - 66:13)
that damaged her cartridge so she lost (66:10 - 66:15)
all her Pokemon that way and that was (66:13 - 66:18)
kind of like that almost like ended her (66:15 - 66:19)
Pokemon career where she was like well I (66:18 - 66:22)
put all this work in this game and now (66:19 - 66:24)
it's all gone I guess I'm just gonna (66:22 - 66:25)
play something else (66:24 - 66:27)
yeah it's it's a bummer when stuff like (66:25 - 66:28)
that happens (66:27 - 66:31)
Richard writes in from Santa bar Santa (66:28 - 66:35)
Barbara California hi spj and crew I am (66:31 - 66:37)
playing through Omega Ruby right now and (66:35 - 66:40)
I have grown quite attached to my Lou (66:37 - 66:44)
noon which is my H M Mon who also gives (66:40 - 66:46)
me gifts through her ability and my (66:44 - 66:49)
Paris Peck Paris act that also knows (66:46 - 66:51)
Spore and fall swipe helps me fill out (66:49 - 66:53)
my pokedex this has got me wondering (66:51 - 66:56)
about non-combat uses for Pokemon in the (66:53 - 66:58)
main series game my question is do you (66:56 - 67:01)
all have any favorite utility Pokemon or (66:58 - 67:04)
utility Pokemon that you used have been (67:01 - 67:07)
come that you've used become attached to (67:04 - 67:11)
cheers Richard well I could say I have (67:07 - 67:14)
in Pokemon X&Y I have a vivillon that I (67:11 - 67:17)
was using for compound eyes and thief (67:14 - 67:19)
which if you guys aren't aware if (67:17 - 67:23)
there's a particular held item that wild (67:19 - 67:25)
Pokemon might have there holding it (67:23 - 67:27)
compound eyes raises the percentage (67:25 - 67:30)
chance that you will come across a wild (67:27 - 67:31)
Pokemon that's holding that item and (67:30 - 67:34)
then thief allows you your vivillon to (67:31 - 67:36)
take that item from them so that that (67:34 - 67:38)
item then becomes part of your inventory (67:36 - 67:40)
and I just enjoyed that mechanic so much (67:38 - 67:42)
that I really grew attached to that (67:40 - 67:45)
little vivillon there unfortunately in a (67:42 - 67:46)
Lola you have to do that with a (67:45 - 67:48)
Butterfree and I did it once and put the (67:46 - 67:49)
Butterfree back in the box (67:48 - 67:54)
I needed a metal coat I mean I would (67:49 - 67:56)
have the same answers as most people (67:54 - 67:59)
right I would say stuff like be barrel I (67:56 - 68:01)
think more interesting Act answer would (67:59 - 68:04)
be to say my Volcarona in generation 5 (68:01 - 68:07)
given that it had access to flame body (68:04 - 68:11)
and the ability to fly so that was (68:07 - 68:13)
before (68:11 - 68:15)
your Gen six isms in your talent flames (68:13 - 68:18)
so instead or maybe it was whatever the (68:15 - 68:20)
other one is magma whatever that makes (68:18 - 68:23)
eggs hatch faster but the ability to fly (68:20 - 68:25)
to a place where I could go straight for (68:23 - 68:27)
a long period of time to hatch an egg (68:25 - 68:31)
and then also have the ability that cuts (68:27 - 68:33)
egg hatching time in half and then (68:31 - 68:35)
having that both on the same Pokemon so (68:33 - 68:36)
I'm not taking up two slots for those (68:35 - 68:42)
abilities was right I don't have any HM (68:36 - 68:44)
Pokemon that I have grown attached to I (68:42 - 68:47)
was one of them seemed like your style (68:44 - 68:50)
yeah no I uh it's very excited when that (68:47 - 68:53)
that stuff went away in in southern Moon (68:50 - 68:56)
I do have a quick a side story because (68:53 - 68:58)
because they mentioned that they had a (68:56 - 69:01)
para sect with false swipe and Spore and (68:58 - 69:03)
that's what they used to catch pokemon (69:01 - 69:07)
irene another irene story here it's not (69:03 - 69:08)
as good as the dream simple story of (69:07 - 69:10)
last week if you if you made it through (69:08 - 69:13)
housecleaning and you were blessed with (69:10 - 69:16)
the Dreamsicle story uh not as good as (69:13 - 69:19)
that story but Irene has a smeargle with (69:16 - 69:21)
false wife and a couple other moves that (69:19 - 69:25)
would matter when you're chaining (69:21 - 69:28)
Pokemon SOS battling it's what it's (69:25 - 69:32)
called and she ran out of false swipes (69:28 - 69:36)
it didn't have anything to replenish the (69:32 - 69:39)
moves and she was panicking because she (69:36 - 69:41)
was SOS battling and she wanted to catch (69:39 - 69:43)
you finally got the Pokemon she wanted (69:41 - 69:45)
to catch she was so scared to knock it (69:43 - 69:48)
out she didn't have any fall swipes left (69:45 - 69:50)
and I said you know you could just throw (69:48 - 69:52)
the pokeball and she was like but I (69:50 - 69:53)
haven't done any damage to it it's like (69:52 - 69:56)
it still has full health and I look I (69:53 - 69:58)
sighed and I was like it it doesn't (69:56 - 70:01)
matter just don't hurt the pokeball (69:58 - 70:03)
and she just threw a regular poke ball (70:01 - 70:06)
and caught it instantly and then I just (70:03 - 70:09)
I was just like in the future just throw (70:06 - 70:10)
pokeballs (70:09 - 70:12)
don't even bother attacking it because (70:10 - 70:15)
that whole mechanic in the game is so (70:12 - 70:16)
broken yep (70:15 - 70:20)
last email I have here is from Mason (70:16 - 70:24)
from Tiffin Ohio I have never heard of (70:20 - 70:25)
that place (70:24 - 70:29)
Tiffin nah don't know it no all right (70:25 - 70:32)
writes hello Pokemon podcast this is my (70:29 - 70:34)
first time riding in I'm sure you've (70:32 - 70:36)
heard that many times before so whatever (70:34 - 70:39)
I write asking three questions should (70:36 - 70:41)
you have time for it by the way my (70:39 - 70:43)
favorite is the person who likes Pokemon (70:41 - 70:45)
so discuss that among yourselves (70:43 - 70:48)
hahahaha that's well we all we can all (70:45 - 70:51)
agree on that that's will (70:48 - 70:51)
yeah although I would say that I spend (70:51 - 70:56)
more time with Pokemon than will does oh (70:54 - 70:59)
good god good enough are us on the show (70:56 - 71:02)
so maybe it's me number one I've started (70:59 - 71:04)
doing research in order to get into (71:02 - 71:07)
competitive play but something something (71:04 - 71:09)
I've noticed on smog on whenever I'm (71:07 - 71:11)
trying to look up it sets for particular (71:09 - 71:14)
Pokemon I often see that Eevee spreads (71:11 - 71:17)
are towards the stats they already have (71:14 - 71:22)
an excess of ie arcanine has full 252 (71:17 - 71:24)
towards speed and attack why is this why (71:22 - 71:26)
not put them into stats that could use a (71:24 - 71:28)
boost already it would make them so much (71:26 - 71:30)
more balanced do you want to answer the (71:28 - 71:33)
question before I do the next two I can (71:30 - 71:35)
I can tackle this one yeah it might seem (71:33 - 71:37)
intuitive that you want to shore up a (71:35 - 71:40)
pokemons weaknesses in that sense it (71:37 - 71:41)
does make a lot of intuitive sense but (71:40 - 71:44)
when you're talking about the actual (71:41 - 71:49)
execution of those strategies you'll end (71:44 - 71:52)
up finding that what the ideal pokemon (71:49 - 71:54)
is not one that (71:52 - 71:57)
can do can be a jack-of-all-trades (71:54 - 72:00)
instead you want an ace of one specific (71:57 - 72:03)
thing you want to be able to have a (72:00 - 72:06)
Pokemon that is specifically capable of (72:03 - 72:08)
knocking out (72:06 - 72:11)
a specific threat so maybe your team has (72:08 - 72:13)
trouble with Ferrothorn so you want to (72:11 - 72:14)
make sure you have a Pokemon in it that (72:13 - 72:19)
has the the capability to take out (72:14 - 72:21)
Ferrothorn in one hit but to do so (72:19 - 72:25)
you'll need to invest all of your EVs in (72:21 - 72:28)
to attack and speed to make sure that (72:25 - 72:29)
you out speed the things are that are (72:28 - 72:31)
important and you're able to one-hit ko (72:29 - 72:33)
that Ferrothorn with whatever Pokemon (72:31 - 72:34)
you're using (72:33 - 72:35)
conversely if you're on the other side (72:34 - 72:37)
of that argument and you're the one (72:35 - 72:39)
running the Ferrothorn you want to make (72:37 - 72:41)
sure that your Ferrothorn because it's (72:39 - 72:43)
already a very defensive Pokemon you (72:41 - 72:47)
want to make sure that you are killed in (72:43 - 72:49)
one hit by the fewest things possible (72:47 - 72:51)
because Ferrothorn job is to sit there (72:49 - 72:53)
deal some damage with iron barbs maybe a (72:51 - 72:55)
rocky helmet if you're getting a super (72:53 - 72:57)
annoying and just sit there with leech (72:55 - 73:00)
seed so you want to you're not really (72:57 - 73:01)
interested in and making offensive (73:00 - 73:03)
attacks you just want to survive as long (73:01 - 73:05)
as possible so that you can whittle down (73:03 - 73:08)
your opponent's offenses so you wind up (73:05 - 73:10)
with an incentive to make the already (73:08 - 73:13)
offensive Pokemon more offensive so that (73:10 - 73:17)
they can deal with defensive Pokemon and (73:13 - 73:19)
you wind up with defensive Pokemon that (73:17 - 73:22)
are as defensive as possible to deal (73:19 - 73:24)
with the hyper offensive ones and surely (73:22 - 73:26)
of course there are exceptions to this (73:24 - 73:29)
but that's generally how the game ends (73:26 - 73:33)
up functioning if you were to have um (73:29 - 73:36)
a Pokemon say like Glalie before mega (73:33 - 73:38)
evolution was available as a pokemon (73:36 - 73:42)
that had 80 in each of its base stats so (73:38 - 73:44)
it's similar to the legendary Pokemon or (73:42 - 73:46)
mythical Pokemon I suppose like mu or (73:44 - 73:48)
Celebi that have 100 in each of its (73:46 - 73:48)
stats (73:48 - 73:51)
Glalie did not get used at all even (73:48 - 73:52)
though you would think sure eighty is (73:51 - 73:54)
not at a super high stat but at least (73:52 - 73:56)
it's balanced so it can do a lot of (73:54 - 73:58)
things well turns out if you can do a (73:56 - 74:00)
lot of things okay you might as well (73:58 - 74:02)
just pick a Pokemon who can do that (74:00 - 74:05)
thing you want it to do super well you (74:02 - 74:07)
you're always picking a Pokemon to fill (74:05 - 74:10)
a specific role and you're always going (74:07 - 74:13)
to end up picking a pokemon that excels (74:10 - 74:16)
at that one role over a Pokemon that is (74:13 - 74:19)
just okay at it does that make sense (74:16 - 74:22)
yes yeah I was going to say to simplify (74:19 - 74:24)
everything that you just said just ask (74:22 - 74:27)
yourself the question why make a (74:24 - 74:31)
mediocre Pokemon less mediocre why not (74:27 - 74:34)
take a great Pokemon and make it greater (74:31 - 74:37)
yeah there was one or you have it there (74:34 - 74:39)
was the white Travis said there's (74:37 - 74:44)
exceptions to that at the 2012 VGC (74:39 - 74:47)
Nationals there was a sub striker with a (74:44 - 74:50)
very weird Eevee spread that allowed it (74:47 - 74:54)
to survive stuff but also like it (74:50 - 74:57)
survived almost every thing it was weak (74:54 - 74:58)
to but it was also still fast enough (74:57 - 75:01)
where it out sped everything and I don't (74:58 - 75:03)
know what that exact Eevee spread was (75:01 - 75:07)
but like Mason VGC VGC is a wild world (75:03 - 75:12)
right because if VGC is you've got weird (75:07 - 75:14)
stuff like trick room and you've got (75:12 - 75:16)
oddities like I mean the fact that (75:14 - 75:18)
you're dealing with two Pokemon on each (75:16 - 75:21)
side mean things tend to be bulkier (75:18 - 75:24)
generally at least in certain versions (75:21 - 75:27)
of the GC meta game so like the GC (75:24 - 75:29)
you'll end up with just out of this (75:27 - 75:29)
world (75:29 - 75:32)
Eevee spreads and weird stuff like (75:29 - 75:34)
before the meta really settles down (75:32 - 75:37)
you'll have this weird speed creep thing (75:34 - 75:41)
where like a Pokemon if like early in (75:37 - 75:43)
the meta oh well and marowak was used (75:41 - 75:46)
like all the time and it's still an (75:43 - 75:47)
important Pokemon (75:46 - 75:49)
um but I think it got more usage early (75:47 - 75:53)
than it does now and before people (75:49 - 75:54)
really figured out what Eevee spread to (75:53 - 75:57)
use on it it would be like people would (75:54 - 75:59)
give it a lot of bulk but then like a (75:57 - 76:01)
tiny bit of speed so out speed other low (75:59 - 76:02)
and marowak and then people would be (76:01 - 76:04)
like well if people are putting four V's (76:02 - 76:06)
in speed I'm gonna put in eight and then (76:04 - 76:08)
people I'm gonna put in twelve and then (76:06 - 76:10)
it just ends up being this weird race to (76:08 - 76:11)
the bottom where you end up with these (76:10 - 76:13)
really fast a little and marowak when a (76:11 - 76:15)
little and marowak has terrible speed (76:13 - 76:17)
and so the only thing it out speeds is (76:15 - 76:19)
itself and then everyone gets to max (76:17 - 76:21)
speed a little and marowak and that's a (76:19 - 76:23)
terrible thing that doesn't work on (76:21 - 76:25)
anything and then people revert to okay (76:23 - 76:27)
I might as well just do a bulky hello (76:25 - 76:29)
and Merrill and then every Street where (76:27 - 76:32)
somebody goes oh yeah my back too bulky (76:29 - 76:34)
I'm just gonna put forward in now it's (76:32 - 76:38)
it's a VGC is a wild wild world ah (76:34 - 76:41)
number two on Mason's question list (76:38 - 76:44)
which is your least favorite type - (76:41 - 76:46)
ferry which I realize I may get hate for (76:44 - 76:48)
Bell stick to my opinion (76:46 - 76:49)
I think I've said this before mine is (76:48 - 76:51)
normal I don't think normal should exist (76:49 - 76:55)
I like normal a lot ferry and ice are my (76:51 - 76:56)
two favorites ice being my favorite (76:55 - 77:00)
second favorite being ferry that (76:56 - 77:01)
although they said least favorite right (77:00 - 77:04)
yeah yeah (77:01 - 77:07)
a fire it's just an animal that's on (77:04 - 77:11)
fire Wow of creative you take an animal (77:07 - 77:14)
and you make it on fire cool I like fire (77:11 - 77:18)
type a lot um it's a tough question (77:14 - 77:21)
there's like so many types out there but (77:18 - 77:23)
out with flying (77:21 - 77:25)
why is a good answer why would be way (77:23 - 77:27)
better if they got rid of normal not (77:25 - 77:30)
everything was normal flying oh it's the (77:27 - 77:31)
worst but then but then it makes (77:30 - 77:33)
tornadoes not special turn anise is cool (77:31 - 77:37)
because it's just fly only one a third (77:33 - 77:40)
question if you lived in any region any (77:37 - 77:42)
town in the region spin-off games (77:40 - 77:43)
included which would it be I am tied (77:42 - 77:46)
between saffron and goldenrod thanks for (77:43 - 77:49)
taking my email into consideration Mason (77:46 - 77:52)
who any town any region I think I've (77:49 - 77:54)
answered this before but I'm going to (77:52 - 77:57)
change I want to move to a polluted city (77:54 - 78:00)
Travis if I can move to any city in the (77:57 - 78:03)
Pokemon world (78:00 - 78:05)
the question was yeah (78:03 - 78:07)
huh I mean I would probably pick one of (78:05 - 78:10)
the big cities I would probably pick a (78:07 - 78:14)
lumiose would be cool all right sure (78:10 - 78:18)
I'll I like city life rather than you (78:14 - 78:21)
know your smaller town life yeah (78:18 - 78:23)
hmm goldenrod has the Train which is (78:21 - 78:25)
pretty cool (78:23 - 78:27)
trains are cool correct I might go (78:25 - 78:29)
celadon because they have the gambling (78:27 - 78:31)
center (78:29 - 78:34)
and they have the bike path (78:31 - 78:35)
off it (78:34 - 78:37)
and it's close to that intersection that (78:35 - 78:40)
connects the other four towns yeah I'll (78:37 - 78:43)
go with celadon it all says a mall that (78:40 - 78:44)
wasn't too hard (78:43 - 78:46)

you it wouldn't be anybody doesn't play (79:52 - 80:01)
yours hereafter man true (79:56 - 80:04)
memo's hundred percent you uh-oh forty (80:01 - 80:09)
percent me we applied for pax west which (80:04 - 80:12)
is September 1st through the the fourth (80:09 - 80:15)
or fifth if I'm not mistaken uh so (80:12 - 80:17)
hopefully we can get into that and go to (80:15 - 80:20)
that I know uh all three of us were at (80:17 - 80:23)
PAX eath East and I think that was a (80:20 - 80:26)
very successful overall (80:23 - 80:28)
I know Travis went on record saying they (80:26 - 80:32)
don't they don't like they don't like (80:28 - 80:35)
conventions so I mean I didn't I didn't (80:32 - 80:37)
and like act specifically like I don't (80:35 - 80:39)
think I would ever really like a gaming (80:37 - 80:43)
convention like a board game or video (80:39 - 80:46)
game convention that's that even though (80:43 - 80:49)
I like both of those things like that in (80:46 - 80:51)
a convention setting isn't very exciting (80:49 - 80:53)
to me I would I mean that doesn't mean I (80:51 - 80:56)
wouldn't still do up a panel at at PAX (80:53 - 80:59)
if we were at one just means oh yeah (80:56 - 81:02)
I'll mope for a bit the rest of the day (80:59 - 81:06)
the nice thing about so I went to pax in (81:02 - 81:08)
San Antonio the very first year it set (81:06 - 81:11)
up and the nice thing about that is it's (81:08 - 81:13)
very cheap to fly to Texas for some odd (81:11 - 81:14)
reason (81:13 - 81:17)
whereas flying to Seattle is is really (81:14 - 81:21)
expensive every year like I've been (81:17 - 81:22)
watching ticket prices ever since (81:21 - 81:24)
January and they're they have not gone (81:22 - 81:26)
down yet and this little app keeps (81:24 - 81:28)
telling me like keep waiting it'll go (81:26 - 81:31)
down so I don't know if it's doable to (81:28 - 81:36)
do like three paksas a year but now that (81:31 - 81:37)
pax south is growing and I definitely (81:36 - 81:39)
want to go to San Antonio again because (81:37 - 81:44)
that city is just beautiful I would love (81:39 - 81:48)
to go but we'd have to play by ear after (81:44 - 81:51)
after pax west and and who's that who (81:48 - 81:53)
knows that they could completely be (81:51 - 81:56)
possible pax is just like thanks but no (81:53 - 81:56)
thanks (81:56 - 81:59)
we have better panels and better podcast (81:56 - 82:02)
and better events that we want to have (81:59 - 82:03)
instead of instead of it's super (82:02 - 82:05)
effective that's totally possible but (82:03 - 82:08)
you know if the patreon still does okay (82:05 - 82:10)
and and people are still listening the (82:08 - 82:14)
show and you know more Pokemon games get (82:10 - 82:15)
released and stuff and we'll have stuff (82:14 - 82:19)
to talk about I will for sure apply for (82:15 - 82:21)
pax south and let you guys know right (82:19 - 82:23)
now though we're just waiting on if PAX (82:21 - 82:25)
West is going to accept us or not so a (82:23 - 82:28)
great question though thank you yeah I (82:25 - 82:31)
know we have a lot of cool listeners in (82:28 - 82:32)
San Antonio that I would love to go and (82:31 - 82:35)
visit so yeah that would be a plus for (82:32 - 82:38)
me the other thing that I think we've (82:35 - 82:39)
talked about this before just taking (82:38 - 82:41)
consideration is just like we all work (82:39 - 82:44)
forty hours like we all have jobs and (82:41 - 82:50)
they can only give us so many days off a (82:44 - 82:52)
year (82:50 - 82:54)
and sometimes I (82:52 - 82:56)
want a week off that isn't at a (82:54 - 82:58)
convention not that I don't like I love (82:56 - 83:02)
conventions uh but they are not like (82:58 - 83:05)
relaxing in any sense it's it's really a (83:02 - 83:07)
balance of time when it comes to stuff (83:05 - 83:09)
like that and with Travis going to (83:07 - 83:10)
Canada (83:09 - 83:15)
I don't know how flying works not only (83:10 - 83:19)
for a given it'll just be more expensive (83:15 - 83:23)
but yeah I mean uh that's not gonna be I (83:19 - 83:25)
mean I'm loaded that's not true at all (83:23 - 83:29)
but I mean like it's not gonna be loaded (83:25 - 83:33)
an ad and uh and I don't even know what (83:29 - 83:34)
the coin is called I freaked out when (83:33 - 83:36)
Carly oh yeah you got your loonies (83:34 - 83:39)
you got your yeah yeah yeah the loonies (83:36 - 83:42)
into I thought she was lying so I text (83:39 - 83:44)
you (83:42 - 83:46)
but but the simple answer is that the (83:44 - 83:48)
forward thrust created by either the (83:46 - 83:50)
Jets or the propeller on the airplane (83:48 - 83:52)
generate lift under the wings as it (83:50 - 83:55)
causes the plane go upwards interest out (83:52 - 83:59)
flying works interesting okay ah but (83:55 - 84:01)
we'll play by ear Peck Sothis is quite a (83:59 - 84:04)
while away ah we still have a backlog of (84:01 - 84:07)
emails um we're catching up but if you (84:04 - 84:09)
have any email if you have any questions (84:07 - 84:11)
comments or concerns you can shoot those (84:09 - 84:15)
over to SBJ at pkmn cast calm or pokmon (84:11 - 84:18)
podcast.com slash or slash contact (84:15 - 84:20)
I guess works or just hit the contact (84:18 - 84:22)
button at the top of page either way I (84:20 - 84:25)
am going to throw it over to Travis (84:22 - 84:29)
they're going to indulge your ears for (84:25 - 84:33)
Pokemon of the week yeah our set this (84:29 - 84:36)
week comes for oh yeah I supposed to say (84:33 - 84:38)
what Pokemon it is the Pokemon this week (84:36 - 84:42)
for Pokemon of the week is vanilluxe my (84:38 - 84:44)
second favorite Pokemon of all time (84:42 - 84:47)
behind piloswine it's vanilluxe with an (84:44 - 84:51)
ICM Z or an assault vest it's gonna be (84:47 - 84:53)
the same set either way it's just the (84:51 - 84:56)
assault vest is going to give you more (84:53 - 84:58)
bulk and the ICM Z is going to give you (84:56 - 85:02)
the ability to take out a large target (84:58 - 85:05)
you wouldn't otherwise have the power to (85:02 - 85:08)
do the ability is snow warning that's an (85:05 - 85:11)
ability like drizzle and drought where (85:08 - 85:14)
it will cause rain - sorry not rain it (85:11 - 85:16)
will cause a weather effect to appear (85:14 - 85:18)
when the Pokemon is set in in the case (85:16 - 85:21)
of snow warning that will be Hale the (85:18 - 85:23)
nature is going to be timid and then (85:21 - 85:26)
your EVs are going to be 252 in Special (85:23 - 85:31)
Attack and 252 in speed with 4 and HP (85:26 - 85:33)
the move set is going to be blizzard (85:31 - 85:36)
freeze dry flash cannon and then either (85:33 - 85:38)
icy wind or protect if you're Iying (85:36 - 85:40)
protect you won't want to put the (85:38 - 85:43)
assault vest on there the description (85:40 - 85:45)
Kevin gives you is the best thing about (85:43 - 85:47)
vanilluxe is its ability which sets up (85:45 - 85:49)
Hale automatically this gives a great (85:47 - 85:51)
advantage on Blizzard as it will never (85:49 - 85:54)
miss freeze dry hits water types (85:51 - 85:55)
that's another move that's really (85:54 - 85:57)
interesting so if listeners don't know (85:55 - 85:59)
freeze dry is a nice type move but it is (85:57 - 86:01)
super effective against water types (85:59 - 86:04)
that's its special effect and then flash (86:01 - 86:08)
cannon hurts fairies protect is a great (86:04 - 86:11)
move for the last slot but alternatively (86:08 - 86:14)
icy wind hits both opponents which is (86:11 - 86:16)
nice as does blizzard but the thing (86:14 - 86:18)
about icy when does it also lowers the (86:16 - 86:22)
speed of the targets by one stage which (86:18 - 86:23)
can be very useful in certain (86:22 - 86:26)
circumstances the thing about vanilluxe (86:23 - 86:29)
is it's really competing for its slot (86:26 - 86:32)
with nine tails because nine tails also (86:29 - 86:34)
has the ability snow warning and also is (86:32 - 86:36)
going to be wanting to spam blizzard (86:34 - 86:38)
over and over again so the thing that (86:36 - 86:41)
sets the two of them apart nine tails is (86:38 - 86:43)
generally going to be faster and (86:41 - 86:46)
vanilluxe has a little more a ten nine (86:43 - 86:49)
tails as a better move pool frankly but (86:46 - 86:51)
vanilluxe has more special attacks so is (86:49 - 86:53)
able to one at Keio a few more things (86:51 - 86:54)
than is nine tails (86:53 - 86:57)
Aloha nine tails that is the other thing (86:54 - 87:00)
I would add is that if you wanted to do (86:57 - 87:01)
things a little bit differently than the (87:00 - 87:03)
set Kevin mentioned you can basically (87:01 - 87:05)
run the same moves with the exception of (87:03 - 87:08)
protect and give it a choice scarf and (87:05 - 87:12)
then you can out speed a lot of common (87:08 - 87:15)
threats and one at Keio a lot of things (87:12 - 87:16)
you know your your guard Trump's of the (87:15 - 87:18)
world things like that there's a lot of (87:16 - 87:19)
things that are four times weak to ice (87:18 - 87:21)
so being able to have a choice scarfed (87:19 - 87:22)
blizzard from (87:21 - 87:26)
vanilluxe with 100% accuracy pretty (87:22 - 87:28)
great so either choice scarf i CMZ (87:26 - 87:29)
assault vest you got a lot of item (87:28 - 87:31)
options there you're definitely going to (87:29 - 87:32)
do snow warning is the ability and then (87:31 - 87:34)
that moves that's pretty great too if (87:32 - 87:36)
you get a shot vanilluxe has a (87:34 - 87:38)
disappointing shiny shiny vanilluxe is (87:36 - 87:41)
just more blue than it is ice color (87:38 - 87:48)
white no but like that water down blue (87:41 - 87:51)
oh it's more of a deeper blue is what I (87:48 - 87:54)
would say yes yeah and the shiny is more (87:51 - 87:55)
of a sky-blue (87:54 - 87:58)
only one bit of trivia here is according (87:55 - 87:58)
to Game Freak (87:58 - 88:01)
vanilluxe and its evolutionary relatives (87:58 - 88:04)
were created by James Turner you guys (88:01 - 88:07)
are probably like who is James Turner (88:04 - 88:09)
he's a British the first American to de (88:07 - 88:12)
son Oh British dang Britain Western grad (88:09 - 88:14)

Pokemon X&Y and two for Pokemon Sun and (88:23 - 88:29)

they're all really great then a (88:45 - 88:51)
good-looking guy - hello Internet (88:48 - 88:53)
vanilluxe maybe a combination of vanilla (88:51 - 88:56)
and deluxe and there you go (88:53 - 88:58)
I don't think anybody's gonna argue with (88:56 - 89:01)
that no no all right a little bit of (88:58 - 89:03)
housecleaning before we go (89:01 - 89:07)

spelling lesson for the day I don't have (89:41 - 89:46)

got anything Travis what's your you get (89:49 - 89:54)
a new season of your show yeah yeah well (89:52 - 89:56)
we haven't launched season two a very (89:54 - 89:59)
random encounters yet but we are what we (89:56 - 90:01)
raring right now is a one-shot we were (89:59 - 90:04)
recorded with sean mccoy of the podcast (90:01 - 90:07)
gz net games and also the image the game (90:04 - 90:09)
company the we're playing a game called (90:07 - 90:11)
monster the week which is based on stuff (90:09 - 90:14)
like supernatural Buffy the Vampire (90:11 - 90:18)
Slayer you know your Scooby Doo's you (90:14 - 90:20)
know any any serial TV show Twin Peaks (90:18 - 90:22)
to some extent that's coming out today (90:20 - 90:25)
holy cow any TV show that's that's based (90:22 - 90:27)
on like our x-files definitely that has (90:25 - 90:28)
like a monster of the week that appears (90:27 - 90:31)
and terrorizes things we played an RPG (90:28 - 90:32)
called monster of the week that's based (90:31 - 90:34)
on shows like that (90:32 - 90:36)
the way very random encounters works is (90:34 - 90:39)
every time we play a new game (90:36 - 90:41)
there is absolutely no continuity with (90:39 - 90:43)
older games so you can certainly start (90:41 - 90:46)
with the first episode of our monster of (90:43 - 90:48)
the week special and then in a few weeks (90:46 - 90:49)
we'll have season two and you can (90:48 - 90:51)
totally start there as well the way the (90:49 - 90:53)
show works is we randomly determine as (90:51 - 90:55)
many things as possible that includes (90:53 - 90:57)
our characters names the places were in (90:55 - 90:59)
the villains their motivations other (90:57 - 91:01)
very strange things (90:59 - 91:03)
it sort of inverts the idea of (91:01 - 91:05)
role-playing games as a power fantasy (91:03 - 91:07)
because very little is within the (91:05 - 91:08)
control of our characters it ends up (91:07 - 91:10)
being a really wacky fun time very (91:08 - 91:12)
random encounters it's on iTunes in any (91:10 - 91:14)
place you're going to get a podcast (91:12 - 91:15)
awesome awesome (91:14 - 91:18)
