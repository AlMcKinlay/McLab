went big (3:31 - 3:34)
breath here we go let's talk about (3:32 - 3:36)
pokemon go (3:34 - 3:38)
[Music] (3:36 - 3:42)
so okay the (3:38 - 3:44)
somewhat relevant will anderson (3:42 - 3:46)
complaint about pokemon go of the week (3:44 - 3:50)
all right i have recently learned (3:46 - 3:52)
that you know how when you start pokemon (3:50 - 3:54)
go and they have i will call it a (3:52 - 3:57)
pop-up that is the news item yeah yeah (3:54 - 4:00)
that pops up if you do not (3:57 - 4:04)
click to read that news item it stays (4:00 - 4:07)
on that news item problem a (4:04 - 4:11)
so if for say 30 days (4:07 - 4:14)
you do not click on that news item it (4:11 - 4:17)
will be a 30 day old news item (4:14 - 4:21)
problem b they only present them to you (4:17 - 4:24)
in sequential order yes once you do (4:21 - 4:27)
click to read 30 day old news item (4:24 - 4:29)
and you log in tomorrow the next news (4:27 - 4:30)
item you see (4:29 - 4:34)
is the 29 day old news item and you've (4:30 - 4:35)
got to eventually (4:34 - 4:37)
get through them until you're caught up (4:35 - 4:39)
rather than them saying (4:37 - 4:41)
hey he's never going to read this let's (4:39 - 4:43)
just cancel it and get to the irrelevant (4:41 - 4:44)
one (4:43 - 4:46)
this is why you don't have victini (4:44 - 4:48)
because niantic (4:46 - 4:50)
knew that you were not victorious in (4:48 - 4:52)
reading the news (4:50 - 4:55)
i was literally getting news items about (4:52 - 4:57)
pokemon go fest (4:55 - 4:58)
last week (4:57 - 5:00)
[Laughter] (4:58 - 5:03)

have those (5:03 - 5:06)
i saw that they uh apologized about mega (5:04 - 5:07)
something or others (5:06 - 5:10)
made changes yeah we'll get to that is (5:07 - 5:12)
that is the (5:10 - 5:15)
the hot topic though what's the hot gas (5:12 - 5:19)

the fire lizard (6:48 - 6:53)
yeah heads up of community day stuff the (6:50 - 6:54)
other thing (6:53 - 6:58)
we got to ah this is off bleeding (6:54 - 7:00)
cool.com never really heard of this (6:58 - 7:02)
website but they have a nice little list (7:00 - 7:03)
of course they've been around for a long (7:02 - 7:06)
time like bleeding cool news (7:03 - 7:08)
they do have a breaking news thing at (7:06 - 7:10)
the top of their website (7:08 - 7:11)
it does say breaking news and then it (7:10 - 7:14)
says super mario odyssey marvel's (7:11 - 7:15)
avengers always sunny (7:14 - 7:18)
star trek assassin's creed manga justice (7:15 - 7:21)
league smackdown pokemon go (7:18 - 7:25)
star wars smackdown again (7:21 - 7:25)
smackdown deadpool wait what there's no (7:26 - 7:30)
breaking news for (7:28 - 7:32)
star trek maybe yeah there is there's a (7:30 - 7:33)
new series (7:32 - 7:36)
oh okay well that's why i i should maybe (7:33 - 7:38)
read bleeding cool more often i didn't (7:36 - 7:39)
know you should (7:38 - 7:41)
double smackdown though do you ever (7:39 - 7:43)
watch star trek (7:41 - 7:45)
i watch i the first star trek i really (7:43 - 7:46)
watched was that movie (7:45 - 7:51)
the the one with the lens flare oh (7:46 - 7:53)
talk about like thinking that a taco is (7:51 - 7:55)
made with a hot dog and (7:53 - 7:59)
what you don't like this i do (7:55 - 8:01)
okay fundamental premise of that movie (7:59 - 8:03)
is that they erased (8:01 - 8:06)
the entire history of all star trek that (8:03 - 8:08)
had gone before it (8:06 - 8:11)
unforgivable yeah i saw that movie (8:08 - 8:12)
that's not why we're (8:11 - 8:14)
on bleeding cool we're on here because (8:12 - 8:16)
they have a list of all the unova (8:14 - 8:18)
pokemon not released yet (8:16 - 8:21)
oh the ones that have not been added to (8:18 - 8:24)
pokemon go yet are muna and musharna (8:21 - 8:27)
if i was a betting person which i'm not (8:24 - 8:28)
because i (8:27 - 8:29)
i think i've been wrong on this show way (8:28 - 8:31)
too many times to count (8:29 - 8:33)
but because they're the dream pokemon (8:31 - 8:34)
you would think (8:33 - 8:35)
and they already announced something (8:34 - 8:37)
called pokemon sleep you would think (8:35 - 8:37)
that (8:37 - 8:39)
would be maybe a tie-in pokemon sleep (8:37 - 8:40)
doesn't exist (8:39 - 8:44)
it's i'm yeah i get sure (8:40 - 8:48)
yeah yeah period it's vaporware (8:44 - 8:51)
that would be my only guess for those (8:48 - 8:52)
unless they're just like here's a (8:51 - 8:55)
psychic weak event we added musharna (8:52 - 8:59)
like okay sure i i mean i could say 50 (8:55 - 9:02)
yes i agree with you that it could be a (8:59 - 9:04)
tie into pokemon sleep (9:02 - 9:07)
but also as far (9:04 - 9:10)
as i recall in (9:07 - 9:12)
black and white and black and white too (9:10 - 9:13)
the (9:12 - 9:17)
uh muna musharnas were somewhat special (9:13 - 9:20)
in the way that you had to get them like (9:17 - 9:22)
one would only show up once a week or (9:20 - 9:23)
something like that (9:22 - 9:26)
um in the dream yard specifically in the (9:23 - 9:26)
dream (9:26 - 9:28)
well but it would only show up like on (9:26 - 9:30)
like wednesdays in the dream yard or (9:28 - 9:31)
something (9:30 - 9:34)
that they might man why don't they do (9:31 - 9:37)
fun stuff like that anymore either way (9:34 - 9:40)
they might just put it in raids or (9:37 - 9:42)
have like a special research task that (9:40 - 9:43)
you have to do (9:42 - 9:46)
that can be completed on wednesdays i (9:43 - 9:47)
mean that was (9:46 - 9:50)
eight years ago nine years ago something (9:47 - 9:51)
like that (9:50 - 9:52)
well i mean the other thing they did (9:51 - 9:54)
with muna and musharna besides the (9:52 - 9:56)
dreamy art stuff was (9:54 - 9:58)
they like used it to advertise the dream (9:56 - 9:59)
world (9:58 - 10:02)
yeah which i missed stream world (9:59 - 10:03)
confirmed (10:02 - 10:07)
sandile crocodrock and crocodile (10:03 - 10:09)
oh you think crocorrock's one of those (10:07 - 10:10)
words that like go players (10:09 - 10:14)
have no clue how to say yes (10:10 - 10:15)
crocodile makes sense if you watch the (10:14 - 10:17)
anime because it's in the anime a lot (10:15 - 10:20)
and ash says it a lot but are they going (10:17 - 10:22)
to have the right sunglasses this time (10:20 - 10:25)
no they don't care about the sunglasses (10:22 - 10:25)
well (10:25 - 10:28)
i had every public niantic person on (10:25 - 10:31)
twitter and asked them about glasses (10:28 - 10:34)
but will anderson wants to know will (10:31 - 10:36)
crocker rock have the right sunglasses (10:34 - 10:37)
this time (10:36 - 10:39)
glasses watch didn't sandal have the (10:37 - 10:40)
sunglasses too (10:39 - 10:43)
it was stand out it was the sand dial (10:40 - 10:45)
first it was the whole line yeah (10:43 - 10:47)
the whole line a whole line had glasses (10:45 - 10:48)
but i mean the whole thing was like the (10:47 - 10:52)
the the was it the ducklits that stole (10:48 - 10:54)
everything and then they stole the (10:52 - 10:56)
sandal sunglasses (10:54 - 10:58)
and then there was the whole thing where (10:56 - 11:00)
there was a flood and all the sand dials (10:58 - 11:01)
like they bit each other's tails to make (11:00 - 11:03)
a bridge and then ash didn't die and it (11:01 - 11:04)
was great (11:03 - 11:07)
maybe the black and white anime was good (11:04 - 11:07)
it (11:07 - 11:11)
was good if you look at the pieces (11:07 - 11:14)
yeah don't look at the ugly puzzle look (11:11 - 11:14)
at the (11:14 - 11:17)
beautiful pieces it does it does have (11:14 - 11:19)
the beyblade rival that beats ash (11:17 - 11:21)
ah there's there were no spinning tops (11:19 - 11:23)
in pokemon (11:21 - 11:26)
uh zarua and zoroark (11:23 - 11:29)
also not in the game i mean they may be (11:26 - 11:30)
we just don't know (11:29 - 11:33)
right it's like the ditto problem yeah (11:30 - 11:35)
yeah (11:33 - 11:37)
man they treated zoroark like a (11:35 - 11:40)
legendary pokemon in black and white (11:37 - 11:42)
and then they were like here's one you (11:40 - 11:43)
could just catch them in black and white (11:42 - 11:44)
too right (11:43 - 11:46)
yeah yeah because in black and white you (11:44 - 11:48)
had to get (11:46 - 11:51)
you had to show a person yeah (11:48 - 11:53)
young lady in the camper trailer right (11:51 - 11:56)
no no they were it was a dude inside (11:53 - 11:57)
castellia city (11:56 - 12:00)
and he's like wait um he wants to see a (11:57 - 12:01)
shiny raikou (12:00 - 12:02)
and tay or suicune and if you show him (12:01 - 12:04)
one of those he gives you zoro (12:02 - 12:07)
zurua i'm pretty sure you had to (12:04 - 12:09)
bring the three because it was a tie (12:07 - 12:10)
into the movie (12:09 - 12:14)
yeah yeah so you had to bring this maybe (12:10 - 12:15)
okay so i don't remember maybe you did (12:14 - 12:17)
show it there but then you had to go to (12:15 - 12:17)
a certain (12:17 - 12:20)
section of like the forgotten forest and (12:17 - 12:22)
then you would have the zoroark (12:20 - 12:24)
encounter there i don't think you could (12:22 - 12:25)
catch that one though (12:24 - 12:27)
no that was the distribution that's how (12:25 - 12:29)
you did it because i had to hack (12:27 - 12:32)
a zorro arc so i could get one (12:29 - 12:32)
[Laughter] (12:32 - 12:38)
look it was a long time ago different (12:36 - 12:40)
times (12:38 - 12:40)
i didn't have friends how is that (12:42 - 12:46)
different times (12:45 - 12:49)
what you stuck how dare you (12:46 - 12:53)
okay i got the details all right the (12:49 - 12:53)
deets (12:53 - 12:56)
all right so both will and i were (12:53 - 12:59)
correct (12:56 - 12:59)
i thought of this conversation because i (12:59 - 13:03)
barely remember that game (13:01 - 13:07)
in castelia city if you showed (13:03 - 13:10)
the person a celebi they would give you (13:07 - 13:12)
a zarua there on the spot (13:10 - 13:14)
and i remember because it puts it into (13:12 - 13:15)
whatever pokeball (13:14 - 13:17)
is in your inventory i remember testing (13:15 - 13:19)
this on twitch so (13:17 - 13:21)
if you throw away all your pokeballs and (13:19 - 13:22)
you only have a master ball it puts the (13:21 - 13:25)
zerua into your master ball (13:22 - 13:28)
which is a fun thing to test (13:25 - 13:28)
let me just you know reset your game i (13:28 - 13:32)
mean does it take the first one in the (13:30 - 13:32)
list (13:32 - 13:34)
so i can get rid of everything but (13:32 - 13:35)
luxury balls and master balls that we'll (13:34 - 13:37)
say (13:35 - 13:40)
where's your science now steve that i (13:37 - 13:41)
don't remember (13:40 - 13:44)
and then you could get the zoroart (13:41 - 13:45)
zoroark (13:44 - 13:47)
in black and white and lost lauren (13:45 - 13:49)
forrest but that requires the (13:47 - 13:53)
shot the the shiny encounter with entei (13:49 - 13:53)
raikko (13:53 - 13:55)
or sweet [ __ ] which they gave out at (13:53 - 13:58)
gamestop at the time yeah (13:55 - 14:00)
um so those are the two ways to get it (13:58 - 14:02)
uh in black and white (14:00 - 14:04)
two it looks like the only way you could (14:02 - 14:06)
get zarua was getting enz (14:04 - 14:08)
zarua was that does not just wandering (14:06 - 14:10)
around somewhere (14:08 - 14:11)
yeah and then you caught it and then it (14:10 - 14:13)
said it was owned by n and then of (14:11 - 14:14)
course all of this gets thrown out the (14:13 - 14:16)
window when you could easily take (14:14 - 14:17)
whatever zero you got (14:16 - 14:20)
you breed it you give it to people and (14:17 - 14:21)
then they breed it and they give it to (14:20 - 14:22)
people (14:21 - 14:25)
yeah and so on and so on and so on (14:22 - 14:26)
do you remember how when you used to (14:25 - 14:29)
capture catch ends pokemon and then they (14:26 - 14:30)
would have like a little (14:29 - 14:32)
sparkle that would come out when they (14:30 - 14:34)
like and you'd be like oh it's a shiny (14:32 - 14:35)
and then yeah (14:34 - 14:38)
no it's actually just ends pokemon there (14:35 - 14:39)
was a point when i was thinking i was (14:38 - 14:41)
going to catch all of n's pokemon and (14:39 - 14:43)
then i didn't care (14:41 - 14:47)
exactly same same thing (14:43 - 14:50)
vanilla vanillish vanillux are not in (14:47 - 14:51)
the game (14:50 - 14:54)
and i don't know why they should be (14:51 - 14:57)
uh waiting for a winter event dairy (14:54 - 14:58)
queen promotional event (14:57 - 15:00)
yeah well are they going to pull the (14:58 - 15:02)
winter event with the vanilla line like (15:00 - 15:04)
they did with the yeah mask line you can (15:02 - 15:06)
only catch em ask when it's (15:04 - 15:10)
spooky deerling and sauzbuck also not in (15:06 - 15:11)
the game (15:10 - 15:13)
because they haven't figured out seasons (15:11 - 15:15)
yet yeah yeah really (15:13 - 15:18)
they do weather they could i mean how (15:15 - 15:19)
hard (15:18 - 15:22)
maybe it is it that hard to say like (15:19 - 15:24)
only this pokemon spawns between (15:22 - 15:28)
january to march like i mean they can do (15:24 - 15:30)
it for community they can't imagine that (15:28 - 15:31)
it's gonna be that hard for (15:30 - 15:34)
my only uh uh yeah i guess my only thing (15:31 - 15:35)
is maybe they're trying to build (15:34 - 15:37)
actual season so they want more than (15:35 - 15:39)
just stealing (15:37 - 15:40)
which you would think that pokemon go (15:39 - 15:43)
would probably eventually want to get to (15:40 - 15:45)
but what other season pokemon are there (15:43 - 15:46)
yeah whatever (15:45 - 15:50)
you can make look i've watched the anime (15:46 - 15:54)
they can make it up as they go (15:50 - 15:56)
we'll see here we just thought you have (15:54 - 15:57)
vanilla ex (15:56 - 16:01)
spawn in winter and then you have yamas (15:57 - 16:03)
spawn and fall i don't know it seems (16:01 - 16:03)
pretty crazy (16:03 - 16:05)
see this stuff is only going to happen (16:03 - 16:07)
when they run out of pokemon and then (16:05 - 16:09)
there's like we've got to do artificial (16:07 - 16:12)
yeah scarcity so oh (16:09 - 16:15)
all of a sudden now out of the pokedex (16:12 - 16:16)
only these sets are going to appear at (16:15 - 16:18)
different times of the year (16:16 - 16:21)
so keep on playing kiddos here summon (16:18 - 16:23)

sure so they're saying on bobopedia (17:55 - 18:03)
the name also appears to show welsh (18:00 - 18:04)
influences (18:03 - 18:07)
so only appearing in wales (18:04 - 18:11)
where's wales is that connected to uh (18:07 - 18:14)
ireland no ireland is all (18:11 - 18:18)
ireland it is the south western section (18:14 - 18:21)
of the british isle (18:18 - 18:25)
the main the big one britain (18:21 - 18:29)
yes sure it's just below liverpool (18:25 - 18:30)
well it's like you got england in the (18:29 - 18:32)
middle we can't (18:30 - 18:34)
scotland on the top and whales in the (18:32 - 18:35)
lower left-hand corner yeah (18:34 - 18:37)
al is going to be typing furiously (18:35 - 18:38)
typing a giant (18:37 - 18:41)
paragraph in slack right now oh we don't (18:38 - 18:44)
understand scotland is the north (18:41 - 18:47)
england is the middle and wales is (18:44 - 18:51)
the phalange to the west but okay (18:47 - 18:53)
and this can be the last statement on (18:51 - 18:54)
the topic i think we can all agree (18:53 - 18:56)
that welsh is the coolest of the (18:54 - 18:58)
languages to come out of that particular (18:56 - 18:59)
island (18:58 - 19:02)

juice (19:02 - 19:06)
as well differently (19:03 - 19:09)

anybody who speaks welch's is just an (19:09 - 19:12)
abomination (19:12 - 19:15)
[Laughter] (19:12 - 19:19)
we have ponyard and bisharp not released (19:15 - 19:22)

the breaking news here community note (21:04 - 21:07)
updates (21:06 - 21:10)
to mega evolution trainers the stuff (21:07 - 21:12)
pokemon go live by the way (21:10 - 21:14)
after listening to your feedback we have (21:12 - 21:16)
made the following changes to mega (21:14 - 21:18)
evolution (21:16 - 21:21)
number one mega energy required the (21:18 - 21:23)
mega energy requirement to mega (21:21 - 21:26)
evolution that has already mega evolved (21:23 - 21:27)
has decreased (21:26 - 21:29)
um what that means is it used to if (21:27 - 21:32)
you've all it costs 200 mega evolve that (21:29 - 21:33)
is the same (21:32 - 21:35)
once you have mega evolved it costs 50 (21:33 - 21:36)
again to mega evolve (21:35 - 21:40)
once again they decreased it to 40. (21:36 - 21:43)
second point the amount of mega energy (21:40 - 21:44)
that trainers are winning (21:43 - 21:47)
from raids have increased so i think the (21:44 - 21:49)
the most you could get before this was (21:47 - 21:52)
about 60. (21:49 - 21:54)
so you get anywhere between like 40 45 (21:52 - 21:56)
50 55 or 60 is what i saw (21:54 - 21:58)
depending on how fast you completed the (21:56 - 21:59)
raid and (21:58 - 22:02)
now it seems that you can get anywhere (21:59 - 22:03)
between (22:02 - 22:06)
like 50 to 90 i think what i remember (22:03 - 22:09)
so if you just got 70 so if you beat it (22:06 - 22:10)
in less than a (22:09 - 22:12)
minute and five i think it's 90 and then (22:10 - 22:13)
a minute and (22:12 - 22:16)
six is like 80 or something (22:13 - 22:18)
i don't have the numbers in front of me (22:16 - 22:19)
but spoiler none of this is gonna be (22:18 - 22:20)
relevant (22:19 - 22:23)
uh here are a few adjustments that we (22:20 - 22:25)
are working on (22:23 - 22:27)
walking with your buddy to earn mega (22:25 - 22:28)
energy (22:27 - 22:30)
more ways to earn energy through (22:28 - 22:32)
research tasks and other gameplay there (22:30 - 22:32)
are (22:32 - 22:34)
research tasks out there currently that (22:32 - 22:36)
do give you mega energy so there are (22:34 - 22:38)
more than one way to do it and then (22:36 - 22:40)
earning bonus candy when catching a (22:38 - 22:43)
pokemon that has the same type of mega (22:40 - 22:44)
evolve pokemon (22:43 - 22:46)
thank you for your feedback as we (22:44 - 22:47)
continue this update stay tuned we'll (22:46 - 22:48)
share more on this (22:47 - 22:50)
development process please be aware of (22:48 - 22:52)
your surroundings blah blah blah um (22:50 - 22:54)
so the the we're to circle back to the (22:52 - 22:55)
start of this conversation after (22:54 - 22:57)
listening to your feedback (22:55 - 23:00)
nothing was listened to let's be clear (22:57 - 23:02)
here (23:00 - 23:02)
oh no they listened they listened but (23:03 - 23:06)
they (23:05 - 23:11)
heard something right here yeah exactly (23:06 - 23:14)
so last week i i said and i (23:11 - 23:16)
i still stand by this i think if you're (23:14 - 23:17)
only filling (23:16 - 23:19)
your poke if you're only there to fill (23:17 - 23:20)
your pokedex (23:19 - 23:22)
you don't care about competitive in the (23:20 - 23:25)
game you just want to fill the decks (23:22 - 23:28)
not indorating not into go battling that (23:25 - 23:28)
kind of stuff (23:28 - 23:30)
i think the process of getting a mega (23:28 - 23:32)
evolution i think is fine it's a little (23:30 - 23:34)
tedious probably take you a week to get (23:32 - 23:34)
one (23:34 - 23:37)
four weeks to take the four plus you get (23:34 - 23:38)
the bonus b drill (23:37 - 23:42)
i think it's fine and then what (23:38 - 23:43)
most of the internet and i think us (23:42 - 23:45)
agree that mega evolution is not really (23:43 - 23:46)
implemented that well (23:45 - 23:48)
and the thing that i saw pop up is a lot (23:46 - 23:50)
of people are like we don't want to rent (23:48 - 23:52)
they're they're throwing away this (23:50 - 23:53)
throwing around this word (23:52 - 23:57)
rent pokemon the the general consensus (23:53 - 24:00)
here not and i don't know if i (23:57 - 24:02)
completely agree with it but i also feel (24:00 - 24:03)
like i don't have a horse in this race (24:02 - 24:04)
because i don't think mega evolution (24:03 - 24:06)
we talked about this last week i (24:04 - 24:07)
personally don't think mega evolution (24:06 - 24:08)
was a cool concept to (24:07 - 24:11)
really begin with um unless it's anime (24:08 - 24:14)
unless it's high level vgc stuff uh is (24:11 - 24:16)
you're wrong but continue (24:14 - 24:19)
they just want it to be free that's it (24:16 - 24:21)
right like it doesn't matter (24:19 - 24:23)
if they lowered the cost and give you (24:21 - 24:26)
more energy per raid (24:23 - 24:28)
they just want it to be free once they (24:26 - 24:30)
activate it the first time (24:28 - 24:32)
so by lowering by doing what they did in (24:30 - 24:33)
this message (24:32 - 24:35)
i don't think there's a there was a (24:33 - 24:37)
single person i found that was like (24:35 - 24:40)
now it's better right right and (24:37 - 24:42)
they said we're listening to your (24:40 - 24:44)
feedback and i believe (24:42 - 24:46)
they're not listening i believe they (24:44 - 24:47)
were looking (24:46 - 24:50)
at what is called the dollar signs of (24:47 - 24:52)
not a lot of people doing raids this (24:50 - 24:53)
last year (24:52 - 24:55)
and they were like what is a minor (24:53 - 24:58)
adjustment we can change (24:55 - 24:59)
that is feedback and sure that is (24:58 - 25:01)
feedback you know i (24:59 - 25:03)
we have the discord for people who watch (25:01 - 25:04)
on twitch and subscribe and we have the (25:03 - 25:05)
patreon (25:04 - 25:07)
we have the slack for people who (25:05 - 25:08)
subscribe that way (25:07 - 25:11)
multiple ways to give i'm trying to (25:08 - 25:13)
follow foot in niantic step multiple (25:11 - 25:14)
ways to give me money (25:13 - 25:18)
but both have been very very hard (25:14 - 25:20)
to find a mega raid in no one seems to (25:18 - 25:21)
want to (25:20 - 25:23)
do mega raids when they're posted in (25:21 - 25:25)
either of those channels (25:23 - 25:27)
um slack has you know close to 700 (25:25 - 25:29)
people discord has 1500 people (25:27 - 25:33)
yet heatran which is not a very (25:29 - 25:35)
good like no one actually likes heat ran (25:33 - 25:36)
but you know (25:35 - 25:38)
he ran it was it was very easy to get a (25:36 - 25:40)
heat rain raid and i think most people (25:38 - 25:42)
in both communities have gotten they're (25:40 - 25:43)
shiny at this point because it was a (25:42 - 25:46)
shiny yeah it was shiny (25:43 - 25:48)
you can get shiny charizard blastoise (25:46 - 25:50)
venusaur i mean i did but (25:48 - 25:53)
we we already have them like there's no (25:50 - 25:55)
extra incentive like this isn't the only (25:53 - 25:55)
time (25:55 - 25:58)
these have been shiny they have been (25:55 - 26:00)
shiny also we are getting (25:58 - 26:03)
a charizard community day in a month and (26:00 - 26:04)
a half (26:03 - 26:07)
like the incentive to do uh not (26:04 - 26:11)
like raids aren't fun and (26:07 - 26:13)
the mega evolution incentive clearly (26:11 - 26:15)
isn't there it's not (26:13 - 26:17)
it's not a game changer it's not super (26:15 - 26:19)
fun and it's temporary (26:17 - 26:21)
there's not a lot of incentive to do (26:19 - 26:23)
them like we're never going to get a (26:21 - 26:26)
heat trend community day until like 2050 (26:23 - 26:28)
when they're real desperate yeah i agree (26:26 - 26:29)
with you (26:28 - 26:32)
i i can't sit here and disagree with you (26:29 - 26:34)
you want to though i can hear it i can (26:32 - 26:36)
hear your voice i just (26:34 - 26:39)
i just don't think that (26:36 - 26:42)
giving in and and just being like okay (26:39 - 26:44)
you unlocked my evolution now it's free (26:42 - 26:45)
forever (26:44 - 26:47)
that is what people want right but (26:45 - 26:49)
that's clearly not what the pokemon (26:47 - 26:50)
company wanted (26:49 - 26:51)
right this was like the way they set (26:50 - 26:53)
this up was very (26:51 - 26:56)
designed to be something that you always (26:53 - 26:57)
work towards and (26:56 - 26:59)
if you want to mega you have to put the (26:57 - 27:00)
work to show it off (26:59 - 27:03)
and we have talked about how pokemon go (27:00 - 27:03)
is (27:03 - 27:06)
just showing things off at this point (27:03 - 27:06)
what should i do (27:06 - 27:08)
did you get did you get any higher (27:06 - 27:10)
bragging rights yeah (27:08 - 27:13)
the whole game is a grind yeah (27:10 - 27:15)
yes sure they could buy in they could (27:13 - 27:17)
make mega evolution free and (27:15 - 27:18)
you know you have to spend 500 mega (27:17 - 27:20)
candy to evolve for the first time (27:18 - 27:20)
instead (27:20 - 27:23)
of 200 but then it's permanent but then (27:20 - 27:25)
that mechanic is then done (27:23 - 27:26)
right there's an end goal to that (27:25 - 27:29)
mechanic and i think (27:26 - 27:31)
their thought process and i'm not saying (27:29 - 27:32)
their thought press is right is (27:31 - 27:35)
they they want they don't want to have (27:32 - 27:37)
end goals for trainers (27:35 - 27:39)
otherwise people want to be open-ended (27:37 - 27:40)
right they want people to keep playing (27:39 - 27:41)
their game (27:40 - 27:44)
so two thoughts first thought is mega (27:41 - 27:45)
evolution is still (27:44 - 27:48)
completely useless in the form of i (27:45 - 27:49)
understand why people don't want to join (27:48 - 27:50)
raids (27:49 - 27:52)
because there's nothing to really do (27:50 - 27:54)
with megas i was like you know what (27:52 - 27:56)
i'm gonna do it i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm (27:54 - 27:57)
gonna champion (27:56 - 28:02)
i'm gonna i'm gonna champion my wallet (27:57 - 28:05)
i'm just gonna i'm gonna help people in (28:02 - 28:07)
the in either discord and slack coming (28:05 - 28:08)
up i'll pay the dollar i'll help them do (28:07 - 28:10)
their megas because there are people (28:08 - 28:11)
that like this (28:10 - 28:13)
right there are people that are okay (28:11 - 28:14)
with this (28:13 - 28:15)
they think the magazines is fun they (28:14 - 28:17)
have no problem spending a dollar here (28:15 - 28:18)
and there (28:17 - 28:21)
and so i got enough candy to mega evolve (28:18 - 28:22)
all of them (28:21 - 28:24)
i haven't mega evolved all of them but i (28:22 - 28:26)
mega evolved blastoise (28:24 - 28:28)
there's only one really i guess there's (28:26 - 28:30)
two things you can make of all blastoise (28:28 - 28:31)
against at this point (28:30 - 28:33)
one is heatran the other is charizard oh (28:31 - 28:35)
no no no no no step back you can mega (28:33 - 28:36)
evolved blastoise against (28:35 - 28:38)
anything you wish it's just whether (28:36 - 28:40)
you're getting any value from doing that (28:38 - 28:43)
first question so even with a mega (28:40 - 28:45)
evolved blastoise the game was smart (28:43 - 28:47)
enough not even to recommend it against (28:45 - 28:49)
charizard (28:47 - 28:50)
because it's not the best counter to (28:49 - 28:52)
charizard right (28:50 - 28:55)
ryperior is charizard's four times a (28:52 - 28:55)
week (28:55 - 28:57)
mega charizard wise four times a week to (28:55 - 29:00)
rock and only two times weak to water (28:57 - 29:02)
and mega charizard x isn't even weak to (29:00 - 29:04)
water because it's dragon and dragon (29:02 - 29:07)
resist water (29:04 - 29:07)
so if if we look at the raid bosses (29:07 - 29:13)
coming and i think we said this a lot (29:10 - 29:15)
all right i said this last week is (29:13 - 29:18)
we have chrysalia next pigeot (29:15 - 29:22)
venusaur charizard blastoise beedrill (29:18 - 29:23)
i guess maybe a drill is super effective (29:22 - 29:26)
against cresselia (29:23 - 29:27)
most of those pokemon are not super (29:26 - 29:29)
effective against crystalline then we (29:27 - 29:30)
have articuno and zapdos again (29:29 - 29:33)
pidgeot beedrill none of those pokemon (29:30 - 29:34)
are super effective against those (29:33 - 29:39)
pokemon either so what are we (29:34 - 29:39)
i maybe that part of the like i i don't (29:39 - 29:44)
think they overlooked they want us to (29:42 - 29:44)
grind (29:44 - 29:47)
forever that's very that's been very (29:44 - 29:49)
clear for the last four years (29:47 - 29:51)
yes the only mega that's probably gonna (29:49 - 29:52)
see a bunch of use (29:51 - 29:56)
is megastranatar because tyranitar is (29:52 - 29:58)
very good in most raids and like mega (29:56 - 29:59)
rayquaza (29:58 - 30:01)
because rayquaza is also very good in a (29:59 - 30:03)
lot of raids (30:01 - 30:05)
uh but i think that's kind of part of (30:03 - 30:06)
the problem now too (30:05 - 30:08)
even if there wasn't any other mega (30:06 - 30:09)
raids (30:08 - 30:12)
isn't i i must i think kyogre is still (30:09 - 30:13)
better than megablastoise in pretty much (30:12 - 30:15)
every situation if you're if you're (30:13 - 30:18)
just using water i don't know the thing (30:15 - 30:18)
that (30:18 - 30:22)
also happened in uh it (30:18 - 30:23)
just seems like it does in the main (30:22 - 30:25)
series games where it's like well i (30:23 - 30:27)
could mega evolve my blastoise but what (30:25 - 30:28)
if i just (30:27 - 30:29)
didn't hit that button and just hit (30:28 - 30:32)
hydro cannon and i was still able to (30:29 - 30:33)
knock it out (30:32 - 30:36)
yeah yeah uh the other thing (30:33 - 30:40)
part two of this is is i (30:36 - 30:44)
slack was was i wouldn't say heated (30:40 - 30:45)
they had their own thought process about (30:44 - 30:47)
mega evolution as well a lot of them (30:45 - 30:49)
being very unhappy with it (30:47 - 30:50)
a couple people saying that they didn't (30:49 - 30:52)
mind it and they liked it but (30:50 - 30:56)
so al brought up um that that he didn't (30:52 - 30:56)
like that it was (30:56 - 31:00)
raid only but from from this press (30:56 - 31:01)
release and from (31:00 - 31:03)
what we also said in the podcast is (31:01 - 31:05)
obviously that wasn't going to be (31:03 - 31:08)
always the case and i i brought up that (31:05 - 31:09)
like (31:08 - 31:13)
well shanks is technically raid only or (31:09 - 31:15)
was at one point right you could (31:13 - 31:17)
you could you can't find shanks in the (31:15 - 31:18)
wild (31:17 - 31:20)
uh i i guess you could find chinks and (31:18 - 31:21)
eggs but at the (31:20 - 31:23)
at at the time when they introduced (31:21 - 31:25)
shanks that was is pretty rare in in in (31:23 - 31:28)
eggs but al al did bring up a good point (31:25 - 31:29)
right like you could do (31:28 - 31:32)
one raid for a shanks and then you could (31:29 - 31:34)
never do another raid again (31:32 - 31:35)
and you could set it as your walking (31:34 - 31:37)
buddy and you could walk with it and it (31:35 - 31:39)
would take you a million years (31:37 - 31:41)
but the at the end of the day you could (31:39 - 31:43)
get a luxury (31:41 - 31:46)
which is i think the closest (31:43 - 31:48)
that like that kind of made me realize (31:46 - 31:50)
what the self rode and (31:48 - 31:52)
and the rest of the internet was talking (31:50 - 31:54)
about is like we want an (31:52 - 31:57)
end goal no matter what and as long as (31:54 - 31:57)
you're (31:57 - 32:00)
charging us candy to mega evolve again (31:57 - 32:03)
we will never feel like we've completed (32:00 - 32:05)
whatever we're searching for so yeah (32:03 - 32:06)
with shanks you could you could keep (32:05 - 32:07)
doing raids for it (32:06 - 32:09)
you could ignore raids altogether and (32:07 - 32:11)
hope that you hatch one (32:09 - 32:12)
and then at that point you could either (32:11 - 32:14)
use rare candy or (32:12 - 32:17)
you could walk with it forever to (32:14 - 32:19)
eventually get a luxury (32:17 - 32:20)
and there's really no way to do that (32:19 - 32:22)
with megas (32:20 - 32:24)
well i i guess there are there's two (32:22 - 32:26)
ways right now you could do rides for (32:24 - 32:27)
megas (32:26 - 32:29)
or you could hope to find the like three (32:27 - 32:31)
tasks out there in the world (32:29 - 32:33)
that give you mega rare mega candy which (32:31 - 32:35)
is only like five (32:33 - 32:37)
so are there any markers in the pokedex (32:35 - 32:39)
or anything like that that say (32:37 - 32:42)
hey this pokemon has been mega evolved (32:39 - 32:44)
there's a whole megadeth yeah (32:42 - 32:46)
oh then yeah then that that should be (32:44 - 32:48)
enough people (32:46 - 32:49)
you can show that to your friends i've (32:48 - 32:51)
never seen the word rented (32:49 - 32:53)
used as much as i have on the internet (32:51 - 32:54)
in the past a week (32:53 - 32:57)
i mean got our slash landlord you'll see (32:54 - 32:58)
it plenty (32:57 - 33:01)
exactly they're not wrong though like (32:58 - 33:01)
it's (33:01 - 33:04)
that's not a wrong analogy when i come (33:01 - 33:06)
it's least it's the same thing it's (33:04 - 33:08)
temporary right (33:06 - 33:10)
and it's that that horrible situation (33:08 - 33:11)
where it's like (33:10 - 33:13)
it's kind of like it's something that (33:11 - 33:15)
you bought but you still have to make a (33:13 - 33:16)
rental payment (33:15 - 33:20)
on it like i already paid full price for (33:16 - 33:21)
this and why do i have to do a monthly (33:20 - 33:23)
subscription just to be able to use it (33:21 - 33:26)
oh that's the territory we're getting (33:23 - 33:27)
into (33:26 - 33:29)
yep the the place i'm coming from is (33:27 - 33:30)
it's such like a (33:29 - 33:33)
weird hill to die on and i say that (33:30 - 33:34)
because (33:33 - 33:36)
i because again this this whole system (33:34 - 33:38)
is useless (33:36 - 33:42)
but i mean even even if it was free you (33:38 - 33:44)
wouldn't use these pokemon (33:42 - 33:46)
you would use different pokemon right (33:44 - 33:47)
now so you you (33:46 - 33:49)
always argue from the the point of the (33:47 - 33:51)
rational player and the majority of the (33:49 - 33:53)
folks out there are not rational players (33:51 - 33:55)
they're like i just want to use the one (33:53 - 33:57)
that i like the majority of the folks (33:55 - 33:59)
just use whatever the game suggests (33:57 - 34:00)
like hey you're going into this (33:59 - 34:03)
charizard and you have eight mega (34:00 - 34:04)
blastoise because it was like i don't (34:03 - 34:06)
know just let's pretend it was free you (34:04 - 34:07)
have eight megablast toys guess what (34:06 - 34:08)
it's not going to recommend mega (34:07 - 34:10)
blastoise because it's not the right (34:08 - 34:10)
choice (34:10 - 34:13)
i mean that's true that's a valid input (34:10 - 34:14)
as well but you could override that (34:13 - 34:16)
choice especially if it's your (34:14 - 34:18)
yeah but especially if you're walking (34:16 - 34:19)
yeah but no one does like (34:18 - 34:21)
like there's probably three people (34:19 - 34:23)
listening to that show that like mega (34:21 - 34:24)
beedrills their all-time favorite (34:23 - 34:24)
pokemon (34:24 - 34:26)
i'm sorry they're just better bug (34:24 - 34:28)
pokemon that are that just do way more (34:26 - 34:29)
damage (34:28 - 34:32)
and out of all the the things wrong with (34:29 - 34:33)
pokemon go and there's plenty of them (34:32 - 34:34)
this is like (34:33 - 34:36)
the weirdest hill for a lot of people to (34:34 - 34:37)
die on like to the point (34:36 - 34:40)
and i say that because like i just read (34:37 - 34:41)
threads of threads of comments of people (34:40 - 34:42)
being like this is the reason i'm (34:41 - 34:43)
leaving the game (34:42 - 34:46)
which is like most like that like the (34:43 - 34:48)
dumbest ultimatum ever (34:46 - 34:52)
but you know you know okay well one (34:48 - 34:55)
it's because it's new two because it's (34:52 - 34:57)
the the current thing to complain about (34:55 - 34:58)
that you're seeing it a lot (34:57 - 35:00)
three there's a lot of confirmation bias (34:58 - 35:02)
going on yeah right like (35:00 - 35:04)
there's a lot of there's a lot of (35:02 - 35:06)
complaints but this this (35:04 - 35:08)
is sure this is what people are mad (35:06 - 35:09)
about right now (35:08 - 35:12)
and this could be the last straw for (35:09 - 35:15)
a bunch of people who felt that (35:12 - 35:16)
everything was going (35:15 - 35:19)
micro transaction nickel dimey and this (35:16 - 35:20)
is just (35:19 - 35:23)
that next evolution that they can't (35:20 - 35:27)
stand anymore like it's not like this (35:23 - 35:28)
it's not like they're saying i was (35:27 - 35:30)
completely happy the entire life and i (35:28 - 35:31)
accepted every charge (35:30 - 35:35)
and now this this one (35:31 - 35:37)
is what's going to kill me no it's it's (35:35 - 35:38)
the (35:37 - 35:41)
you know it's the last straw it's the (35:38 - 35:42)
final paper cut (35:41 - 35:44)
it's what i was saying last time when (35:42 - 35:46)
you when you become (35:44 - 35:50)
very aware of the money-making (35:46 - 35:53)
scheme and the money-making grasp (35:50 - 35:56)
and that becomes sour because you could (35:53 - 35:58)
ignore it before but now you can't (35:56 - 35:59)
because it's so obvious (35:58 - 36:02)
that will ruin games for people that (35:59 - 36:03)
right yeah (36:02 - 36:06)
it's it is almost like a representation (36:03 - 36:07)
have you ever heard the expression like (36:06 - 36:08)
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled (36:07 - 36:10)
was convincing people that he didn't (36:08 - 36:11)
exist (36:10 - 36:13)
yes right and it's the same thing right (36:11 - 36:15)
the greatest trick that these games can (36:13 - 36:16)
do (36:15 - 36:17)
is make you believe that they're not (36:16 - 36:19)
making any money off of you (36:17 - 36:22)
right and once visible to you (36:19 - 36:26)
that like oh wait they are actually are (36:22 - 36:29)
getting money off of me that sours it (36:26 - 36:32)
so much that you're like oh (36:29 - 36:35)
well but but my money would be better (36:32 - 36:36)
spent (36:35 - 36:39)
on carrot cake slices why am i spending (36:36 - 36:42)
my money on this digital entertainment (36:39 - 36:43)
that's (36:42 - 36:47)
actually not that entertaining (36:43 - 36:48)
i mean it's the same complaint you have (36:47 - 36:51)
for eggs you know when it's incubator (36:48 - 36:52)
egg events and it's just like well (36:51 - 36:55)
this is just a you know niantic needs a (36:52 - 36:57)
boost for the next research like when it (36:55 - 36:58)
becomes (36:57 - 37:01)
harder to ignore it becomes a bigger (36:58 - 37:02)
issue (37:01 - 37:05)
i want someone to create a diagram (37:02 - 37:11)
chart of the niantics fiscal quarters (37:05 - 37:14)
and event scheduling to see like when (37:11 - 37:15)
they need to (37:14 - 37:17)
pad those numbers to say oh we've got (37:15 - 37:20)
this much profit in q2 (37:17 - 37:21)
and it's like oh because you (37:20 - 37:23)
conveniently had an egg event during (37:21 - 37:24)
that time (37:23 - 37:27)
i think it's really easy to ignore megas (37:24 - 37:28)
like i (37:27 - 37:32)
i agreed i completely ignore them i play (37:28 - 37:34)
pokemon go by sending gifts that's it (37:32 - 37:35)
there's nothing in the game that would (37:34 - 37:37)
be like oh niantic is paying to win (37:35 - 37:39)
because we can't complete this without a (37:37 - 37:42)
mega pokemon like (37:39 - 37:42)
nothing needs this and i don't think (37:42 - 37:46)
nothing will need this (37:44 - 37:49)
yeah but that doesn't mean that when (37:46 - 37:50)
something new is announced (37:49 - 37:52)
and everybody's excited for it and (37:50 - 37:54)
everybody's looking into it thinking oh (37:52 - 37:56)
this is great and then (37:54 - 37:59)
you know hahaha the skin was peeled back (37:56 - 38:00)
and you're like oh (37:59 - 38:03)
yeah they can ignore it but it was the (38:00 - 38:05)
new thing that you were excited (38:03 - 38:07)
yeah to look at and now you're kind of (38:05 - 38:09)
confronted with (38:07 - 38:12)
oh and that's not easily ignored for a (38:09 - 38:14)
lot of people because yes (38:12 - 38:16)
i i'll do a raid every once while i (38:14 - 38:17)
don't care about it (38:16 - 38:19)
because i made my piece and i'm not (38:17 - 38:21)
going to give them a ton of money unless (38:19 - 38:22)
i really (38:21 - 38:25)
have to um and i don't do great things (38:22 - 38:26)
because i don't (38:25 - 38:28)
like paying my money but for people who (38:26 - 38:30)
had that illusion (38:28 - 38:32)
shattered that's not easy to come back (38:30 - 38:33)
from (38:32 - 38:36)
yes you can never do another mega thing (38:33 - 38:41)
before but you can't unsee what you saw (38:36 - 38:42)
yeah i also hate when people use the (38:41 - 38:44)
expression pay to win for pokemon go (38:42 - 38:45)
there is only one (38:44 - 38:47)
win in pokemon go and that's getting to (38:45 - 38:50)
level 40. you either are level 40 (38:47 - 38:52)
or i don't know your name you know my (38:50 - 38:54)
name william (38:52 - 38:57)
who are you excuse rude boy yeah i mean (38:54 - 38:59)
there's no pay to win in in the in the (38:57 - 39:01)
essence of (38:59 - 39:03)
everything outside go battling where go (39:01 - 39:05)
battling is pay to win because (39:03 - 39:09)
elite tms exists another two things (39:05 - 39:12)
what happens when these there's what 64 (39:09 - 39:15)
65 mega pokemon total not a lot (39:12 - 39:18)
uh what like what happens when charizard (39:15 - 39:19)
venus or blastoise go away (39:18 - 39:21)
they're not going to be in rates forever (39:19 - 39:22)
oh they're going to come up with some (39:21 - 39:23)
sort of generic (39:22 - 39:25)
mega yeah like like instead of rare (39:23 - 39:27)
candy there's going to be just generic (39:25 - 39:28)
mega candy which (39:27 - 39:31)
is not surprising here is this is what i (39:28 - 39:32)
need them to do (39:31 - 39:36)
find some way for me to be able to (39:32 - 39:37)
convert (39:36 - 39:38)
what is that that's clogging up my bag (39:37 - 39:40)
that i've got like a bajillion i've got (39:38 - 39:43)
like even more rare candies (39:40 - 39:45)
i got i gotta do how i do have a heck (39:43 - 39:46)
ton of rare candies (39:45 - 39:48)
fine give me a way to convert rare (39:46 - 39:50)
candies into (39:48 - 39:53)
mega evolution no no i just put the rare (39:50 - 39:54)
candy into like (39:53 - 39:58)
groudon and or zekrom or restaurant (39:54 - 40:00)
i don't think i have any of them okay (39:58 - 40:03)
good good start (40:00 - 40:08)
i do have what is it 600 and yeah 639 (40:03 - 40:09)
rare candy (40:08 - 40:11)
i have like 300. you can put them you (40:09 - 40:13)
can put the rare candy into a pokemon (40:11 - 40:14)
but not spend it on the pokemon so you (40:13 - 40:16)
could put like a hundred rare candy on (40:14 - 40:17)
mewtwo and then just now you have 100 (40:16 - 40:19)
youtube candy which is not clogging your (40:17 - 40:20)
space (40:19 - 40:21)
but you don't have to spend the mewtwo (40:20 - 40:23)
candy but i don't (40:21 - 40:26)
like i don't like touching the pokemon (40:23 - 40:27)
in pokemon go i like sending gifs and (40:26 - 40:29)
putting cute little stickers on them (40:27 - 40:31)
and then getting gifts and seeing where (40:29 - 40:32)
people have been that's (40:31 - 40:35)
my joy of pokemon go oh yeah stickers (40:32 - 40:36)
was the thing that people were finally (40:35 - 40:37)
gonna quit the game over but now it's (40:36 - 40:38)
megas (40:37 - 40:40)
interesting i like them stickers i like (40:38 - 40:42)
the (40:40 - 40:46)
meow stickers of stickers anyone who has (40:42 - 40:47)
ever complained about stickers on the (40:46 - 40:49)
internet in pokemon go has (40:47 - 40:52)
clearly been deprived in their life to (40:49 - 40:54)
have never gotten a postcard from a (40:52 - 40:56)
friend that has like four stickers on it (40:54 - 40:59)
like stickers are as useless as they are (40:56 - 41:01)
in pokemon go as they are in real life (40:59 - 41:02)
they're just fun that's all it is (41:01 - 41:04)
you just buy dumb stickers and you go (41:02 - 41:06)
i'm gonna send my friend a letter and (41:04 - 41:08)
then you put a sticker on it and you go (41:06 - 41:09)
well i guess it's better on this letter (41:08 - 41:11)
than it is sitting in a drawer (41:09 - 41:12)
and then you mail it and then your (41:11 - 41:14)
friend gets it and you go oh look at (41:12 - 41:15)
this dumb bulbasaur sticker that says (41:14 - 41:16)
bye that's cute (41:15 - 41:17)
all right this letter is going in the (41:16 - 41:20)
trash this it's like a one to one (41:17 - 41:22)
exact replica of how the real world and (41:20 - 41:24)
pokemon go overlaps (41:22 - 41:27)
maybe the only thing that overlaps look (41:24 - 41:29)
if there's anything i've learned about (41:27 - 41:31)
serious players of pokemon go it's that (41:29 - 41:32)
they do not enjoy (41:31 - 41:35)
fun and they don't like fun things (41:32 - 41:38)
so there's your disconnect what was i (41:35 - 41:38)
saying oh (41:38 - 41:42)
oh whoever knows they're going to keep (41:38 - 41:44)
releasing magnus obviously there's 60 (41:42 - 41:45)
some other measures they got to release (41:44 - 41:47)
i'm assuming at one point there's going (41:45 - 41:49)
to be some generic candy (41:47 - 41:51)
that they're just gonna be like raid (41:49 - 41:54)
this is a mega raid it will give you (41:51 - 41:56)
generic candy level up whatever manga (41:54 - 41:57)
you want (41:56 - 41:59)
the other question is if the pokemon (41:57 - 42:02)
company and niantic are not going to (41:59 - 42:04)
give in and make this free for people (42:02 - 42:05)
i'm sorry not free (42:04 - 42:10)
um one time use where is the compromise (42:05 - 42:14)
because no one was satisfied after this (42:10 - 42:16)
no one who was already upset became less (42:14 - 42:17)
upset (42:16 - 42:20)
after this press release although (42:17 - 42:22)
getting more candy from winning a raid (42:20 - 42:23)
is (42:22 - 42:25)
good for me because i was doing raids (42:23 - 42:26)
and i was like yeah this is fine i guess (42:25 - 42:28)
i'll make evolve this (42:26 - 42:29)
last way so i can take a picture of it i (42:28 - 42:31)
don't i don't know it sounds like a lot (42:29 - 42:34)
are we sure about that number what yeah (42:31 - 42:37)
no that's right i i i trust steve when (42:34 - 42:37)
he (42:37 - 42:40)
quotes those sorts of facts i'm looking (42:37 - 42:42)
it up (42:40 - 42:46)
how many are there 46. four no way (42:42 - 42:47)
are we talking like both charizards (42:46 - 42:50)
though both charizards both ladies (42:47 - 42:53)
then that goes up to at most 50. (42:50 - 42:55)
why are we talking are we are we (42:53 - 42:57)
including groudon in there (42:55 - 42:59)
wait why would you include groudon (42:57 - 43:00)
groudon doesn't make evil i know they (42:59 - 43:01)
probably evolve but (43:00 - 43:05)
yeah you gotta list it as are we talking (43:01 - 43:07)
ash greninja (43:05 - 43:10)
that's not a mega evolution look (43:07 - 43:12)
just because you are not talented enough (43:10 - 43:14)
to not need a mega stone because your (43:12 - 43:15)
bond between you and your pokemon are so (43:14 - 43:16)
good (43:15 - 43:20)
look i love them i love the nintendo 64. (43:16 - 43:22)
i feel like if you never know the number (43:20 - 43:24)
64 is just a good number to throw out (43:22 - 43:27)
oh yeah how old are you 64. (43:24 - 43:30)
let's see how that goes for you steve (43:27 - 43:32)
okay what's what's the compromise then (43:30 - 43:34)
is the compromise like as long as it's (43:32 - 43:35)
your mega (43:34 - 43:37)
like do you think if they say as long as (43:35 - 43:38)
it's your walking buddy it's free to (43:37 - 43:41)
mega evolve do you think people would be (43:38 - 43:42)
okay with that (43:41 - 43:43)
but then you still have to like as long (43:42 - 43:44)
as it's your walking buddy and your (43:43 - 43:46)
walking buddies happy with you because (43:44 - 43:48)
my walking buddies never happy with me (43:46 - 43:48)
this (43:48 - 43:51)
this would be my solution oh here we go (43:48 - 43:54)
if you get to four star friends with (43:51 - 43:55)
your walking buddy (43:54 - 43:57)
it is permanently unlocked but i thought (43:55 - 43:59)
getting to force our friends wasn't that (43:57 - 43:59)
hard (43:59 - 44:01)
it's not hard it's just tedious it takes (43:59 - 44:04)
like as long it just takes like (44:01 - 44:05)
how many hearts go i think it takes like (44:04 - 44:09)
64 hearts (44:05 - 44:12)
you can't stop throwing around 64 like (44:09 - 44:14)
it's a real number (44:12 - 44:17)
i'm gonna make 64 happen how many hearts (44:14 - 44:18)
to get max but (44:17 - 44:21)
it it takes it takes what like two weeks (44:18 - 44:23)
not two weeks sorry to like two months (44:21 - 44:24)
yeah something like that it takes a (44:23 - 44:26)
pretty long time how can i okay that's (44:24 - 44:27)
that's reasonable that's kind of like (44:26 - 44:29)
what i said last week of just like get (44:27 - 44:29)
do (44:29 - 44:31)
something where you have to do it enough (44:29 - 44:33)
times and then you get the mega stone (44:31 - 44:34)
and then you don't have to do it anymore (44:33 - 44:36)
and again besides seeing like (44:34 - 44:38)
people saying this is the reason i'm (44:36 - 44:39)
quitting the game or i (44:38 - 44:41)
i'm not i hate mega evolution this (44:39 - 44:43)
doesn't make it better the thing i saw (44:41 - 44:45)
over and over besides all of that was (44:43 - 44:47)
i don't care how long it takes as long (44:45 - 44:48)
as there's an end goal (44:47 - 44:51)
uh it took me 38 days to get my meowth (44:48 - 44:53)
to four stars (44:51 - 44:56)
it took me 50 days to get my vulpix the (44:53 - 44:57)
four (44:56 - 44:59)
star not stars four hearts it took me (44:57 - 45:02)
123 days to get my bonsli (44:59 - 45:05)
to four no maybe yes (45:02 - 45:08)
man i spent a long time with that bonsai (45:05 - 45:09)
hatchet in dc (45:08 - 45:13)
it takes 300 hearts (45:09 - 45:16)
to be best buddies okay so the easy (45:13 - 45:18)
thing you can see 64. (45:16 - 45:21)
that's a big difference great buddies so (45:18 - 45:25)
300 hearts um and if you just do the (45:21 - 45:26)
bare minimum a day which is feed it (45:25 - 45:27)
three times (45:26 - 45:29)
pet it take a picture that's three (45:27 - 45:30)
hearts (45:29 - 45:33)
so 100 days so three months if you're (45:30 - 45:35)
doing the bare minimum i'm assuming most (45:33 - 45:36)
people are probably (45:35 - 45:37)
doing a little bit more on commuting (45:36 - 45:39)
days or days where they play (45:37 - 45:42)
an hour or two that that would be my (45:39 - 45:43)
solution (45:42 - 45:46)
is make the great buddy thing a little (45:43 - 45:47)
bit better (45:46 - 45:50)
if you want free mega charizard x you (45:47 - 45:50)
just (45:50 - 45:54)
great buddy it and then because the (45:50 - 45:54)
whole (45:54 - 45:56)
i mean lore wise obviously mega (45:54 - 45:57)
evolution doesn't last forever but also (45:56 - 45:59)
lore wise is (45:57 - 46:02)
they karina what's her name karina she's (45:59 - 46:04)
like oh it's a bond between (46:02 - 46:07)
pokemon and their trainers everything's (46:04 - 46:09)
a bond between pokemon and your trainers (46:07 - 46:10)
that's the most useless advice (46:09 - 46:13)
but then if you hate the buddy thing and (46:10 - 46:15)
you don't want to use the buddy thing (46:13 - 46:17)
then you can do raids or you can do you (46:15 - 46:18)
can walk it (46:17 - 46:22)
uh or you could do the field research (46:18 - 46:22)
test (46:22 - 46:26)
like i think i think really (46:22 - 46:29)
more options is better like i don't want (46:26 - 46:31)
to specifically hatch eggs to get shanks (46:29 - 46:33)
because i hate hatching eggs (46:31 - 46:35)
i will just pay the dollar to the shanks (46:33 - 46:36)
i can visually see (46:35 - 46:38)
and just get it that way and then not (46:36 - 46:40)
catch it in that raid so you're to keep (46:38 - 46:42)
paying dollars until you do catch it i (46:40 - 46:43)
don't i (46:42 - 46:45)
yeah i mean it's clear to me that people (46:43 - 46:46)
don't like it because they're not (46:45 - 46:48)
joining my raids (46:46 - 46:48)
look i was asleep i had no idea that you (46:50 - 46:54)
had sent it (46:53 - 46:58)
so 48 mega pokemon total (46:54 - 47:01)
and then may and then primal groudon and (46:58 - 47:02)
kyogre will probably be the same process (47:01 - 47:03)
as megas (47:02 - 47:05)
let's take a break and we get back we (47:03 - 47:08)
got some tcg stuff and some master stuff (47:05 - 47:09)
to talk about so we will be (47:08 - 47:13)
right back garbage (47:09 - 47:18)
garbage garbage (47:13 - 47:18)

we are back pokemon trading (47:28 - 47:34)

heck no ebv no i'm going with er (48:04 - 48:10)
eternalists (48:07 - 48:10)
[Music] (48:12 - 48:18)
which will you choose one of three foil (48:15 - 48:21)
cards five booster packs in each ten (48:18 - 48:22)
i'm going to tell you right now the (48:21 - 48:24)
teams are the tins are scam (48:22 - 48:26)
i don't think how many packs of hidden (48:24 - 48:27)
shadows (48:26 - 48:31)
hidden fates hidden fates hidden (48:27 - 48:34)
x and y hidden moon hidden fates is up (48:31 - 48:35)
to 18 dollars a booster pack (48:34 - 48:38)
if you can find it what for the (48:35 - 48:41)
charizard for the charizard (48:38 - 48:43)
for the chance of a charizard please (48:41 - 48:44)
open it up it will (48:43 - 48:46)
drop in price immediately speaking of (48:44 - 48:49)
tcgs and charizards (48:46 - 48:53)
um our my friend and yours (48:49 - 48:57)
aaron pulled a full art charizard (48:53 - 49:00)
v-max okay where does he get it raided (48:57 - 49:03)
nowhere because i wouldn't trust sending (49:00 - 49:04)
anything through the postal service (49:03 - 49:05)
right now (49:04 - 49:08)
okay if it in an ideal world where does (49:05 - 49:10)
he get it ready uh it doesn't matter too (49:08 - 49:10)
much uh (49:10 - 49:13)
becky beckett or psa um doesn't matter (49:10 - 49:14)
too much (49:13 - 49:17)
okay uh i think if if you can get (49:14 - 49:18)
beckett black (49:17 - 49:20)
i think that is the because black is (49:18 - 49:23)
more than a 10 or something like that (49:20 - 49:24)
but i think a beckett 10 is slightly (49:23 - 49:27)
worth more than a psa 10 but like by (49:24 - 49:28)
slightly i mean like maybe there's like (49:27 - 49:29)
a 10 (49:28 - 49:31)
difference some people there you go (49:29 - 49:33)
people specifically always you can use (49:31 - 49:35)
only want to get beckett (49:33 - 49:37)
i'm assuming it's like coke and pepsi (49:35 - 49:39)
some people only want psa some only want (49:37 - 49:41)
beckett but the becca people are we're (49:39 - 49:43)
more stuck up (49:41 - 49:44)
i don't know if that charger would go up (49:43 - 49:47)
or down i think in the long run it goes (49:44 - 49:47)
up because (49:47 - 49:50)
most stars go up in the long run but i (49:47 - 49:51)
think back in the day (49:50 - 49:54)
when i worked at shinders we had an (49:51 - 49:55)
in-house (49:54 - 49:58)
card raider yeah but that's that doesn't (49:55 - 49:59)
got name brand (49:58 - 50:03)
on it right that was just because (49:59 - 50:06)
we were willing to pay for it the the (50:03 - 50:08)
real problem with like beckett (50:06 - 50:11)
and psa is that (50:08 - 50:14)
if you live near it that's way better (50:11 - 50:15)
than (50:14 - 50:16)
mailing right because even even if there (50:15 - 50:19)
wasn't postal issues (50:16 - 50:22)
you still have to get that card insured (50:19 - 50:22)
so (50:22 - 50:24)
like let's say you pulled shiny (50:22 - 50:26)
charizard from hidden fates (50:24 - 50:29)
which at this point is i think selling (50:26 - 50:30)
if if it's like an (50:29 - 50:32)
eight or a nine i think it's selling for (50:30 - 50:34)
like eight hundred dollars (50:32 - 50:36)
and so not only do you have to like (50:34 - 50:37)
sleeve it and then (50:36 - 50:39)
top load it and then wrap it in bubble (50:37 - 50:41)
wrap and then like put it into like a (50:39 - 50:42)
concrete box and then (50:41 - 50:44)
like take it to the post office and (50:42 - 50:46)
they're like it's 30 (50:44 - 50:49)
to ship this piece of paper is do you (50:46 - 50:50)
want to insure it and you're like yes (50:49 - 50:52)
and they're like how much and you're (50:50 - 50:54)
like uh 80 (50:52 - 50:56)
hundred dollars and you're like oh well (50:54 - 50:58)
now now that's a hundred dollars worth (50:56 - 50:59)
of postal service (50:58 - 51:02)
insurance is like two dollars is it two (50:59 - 51:02)
dollars (51:02 - 51:05)
oh it's super postal insurance i don't (51:02 - 51:06)
know anyone who (51:05 - 51:09)
would like if i'm setting a 100 card to (51:06 - 51:11)
get graded (51:09 - 51:14)
to sell it and i don't get insurance on (51:11 - 51:14)
it (51:14 - 51:16)
like that's not on the postal service (51:14 - 51:17)
that's on you i just (51:16 - 51:19)
i've just heard a couple horror stories (51:17 - 51:21)
of people sending their (51:19 - 51:23)
shiny charizards over to beckett and it (51:21 - 51:25)
getting lost in the mail and they didn't (51:23 - 51:27)
get insurance that's like that's all on (51:25 - 51:28)
you (51:27 - 51:30)
value up to fifty dollars is the dollar (51:28 - 51:31)
sixty five (51:30 - 51:33)
fifty dollars in one cent to a hundred (51:31 - 51:35)
dollars is two dollars (51:33 - 51:37)
and five cents one hundred and one (51:35 - 51:39)
dollars to two hundred dollars is two (51:37 - 51:40)
dollars and forty five (51:39 - 51:45)
cents so get that insurance (51:40 - 51:46)
but it's cheap if you live next to a (51:45 - 51:48)
becket you could like that's the other (51:46 - 51:50)
problem too is even if the if the card (51:48 - 51:51)
was worth like 800 bucks (51:50 - 51:53)
easy easy choice mail it get the (51:51 - 51:55)
insurance call it a day (51:53 - 51:57)
but if you have a card that's worth like (51:55 - 51:58)
20 and you just want to like (51:57 - 52:00)
grade it and you just want to keep it (51:58 - 52:02)

uh cosmic eclipse which is still okay (54:36 - 54:43)

okay it has the rainbow rare charizard (54:43 - 54:47)
200 (54:46 - 54:50)

i'm going to say that first pack is (54:51 - 54:54)
garbo i'm not sure what it is though (54:52 - 54:56)
i don't think they're still stocking (54:54 - 54:58)
roaring skies (54:56 - 55:01)
the other tcg news the deck (54:58 - 55:04)
that everyone hates which involves using (55:01 - 55:08)
zashian and uh adp which is (55:04 - 55:11)
short for uh art arceus dialga and (55:08 - 55:12)
palkia (55:11 - 55:14)
the pokemon company decided to put that (55:12 - 55:16)
deck into a box and sell it to you for (55:14 - 55:17)
25 bucks (55:16 - 55:21)
i'm into it they did this before with (55:17 - 55:24)
zekrom pikachu which was a very very (55:21 - 55:25)
popular deck i (55:24 - 55:27)
made a youtube video about if you want (55:25 - 55:29)
to get into the trading card game that (55:27 - 55:31)
is something you should buy (55:29 - 55:32)
because not only do you get the physical (55:31 - 55:35)
deck which you get a code card to get (55:32 - 55:36)
that entire deck (55:35 - 55:40)
into ptc geo the online client (55:36 - 55:42)
so and then they also had a restaurant (55:40 - 55:44)
and uh charizard deck which is (55:42 - 55:46)
as good i don't think as good as the (55:44 - 55:49)
pikachu zekrom but they are putting out (55:46 - 55:50)
another one in november (55:49 - 55:53)
the these are called league battle decks (55:50 - 55:54)
um it will feature (55:53 - 55:57)
zashi and v and arceus diagopalkia (55:54 - 55:59)
are they legal for competitive play 100 (55:57 - 56:01)
yep (55:59 - 56:05)
nice it will have uh a 60 card deck (56:01 - 56:08)
two pokemon v one tag team um so now (56:05 - 56:10)
ideally with (56:08 - 56:13)
with these decks the higher competitive (56:10 - 56:13)
level (56:13 - 56:15)
they're probably running like three v (56:13 - 56:17)
cards and three tag teams but they're (56:15 - 56:18)
giving you one (56:17 - 56:21)
although uh adp is not too expensive (56:18 - 56:24)
uh two acrylic marker condition markers (56:21 - 56:25)
one (56:24 - 56:27)
tag team marker six damage counter dice (56:25 - 56:28)
a competitive coin (56:27 - 56:32)
the rule book the code card the deck box (56:28 - 56:34)
it gives you all that 25 bucks it'll be (56:32 - 56:35)
available in november (56:34 - 56:39)
um i think the the actual news here is (56:35 - 56:41)
uh people were really really hoping for (56:39 - 56:43)
an adp ban (56:41 - 56:46)
because adp really limits the current (56:43 - 56:49)
meta it has limited the meta since (56:46 - 56:52)
it has arrived uh there's not a really a (56:49 - 56:54)
lot of good counters to adp besides (56:52 - 56:56)
adp uh and since they're putting out a (56:54 - 56:59)
league battle deck it doesn't seem like (56:56 - 57:01)
they're going to ban adp (56:59 - 57:03)
yeah they kind of did the opposite (57:01 - 57:04)
they're like yeah let's actually make it (57:03 - 57:05)
more (57:04 - 57:07)
popular they could i guess i mean they (57:05 - 57:09)
did put out a porygon distribution and (57:07 - 57:14)
then ban for it again (57:09 - 57:15)
that was a different branch of the (57:14 - 57:17)
company sir so maybe they just want to (57:15 - 57:18)
get their 25 dollars (57:17 - 57:20)
out of people and then before they (57:18 - 57:22)
banned them before they ban it yeah (57:20 - 57:24)
before the ban list when's when does it (57:22 - 57:25)
do to rotate out like (57:24 - 57:29)
oh adp8 rotating out to (57:25 - 57:32)
add next summer minimum uh because we (57:29 - 57:35)
just got we just got rotation and cosm (57:32 - 57:37)
adp is part of cosmic eclipse and cosmic (57:35 - 57:40)
eclipse was on the threshold of (57:37 - 57:43)
being legal for a whole another year wow (57:40 - 57:45)
and the next set coming out which is (57:43 - 57:46)
vivid voltage i think (57:45 - 57:49)
uh has a card that will make (57:46 - 57:51)
adp even better (57:49 - 57:53)
[Laughter] (57:51 - 57:57)
yay give me that (57:53 - 57:58)
money they could ban they have done (57:57 - 58:00)
emergency bans before it's pretty rare (57:58 - 58:01)
but (58:00 - 58:03)
what was it when will and i were playing (58:01 - 58:05)
there was an emergency ban (58:03 - 58:07)
and i don't remember what it was on me (58:05 - 58:08)
either (58:07 - 58:11)
it wasn't even like that popular oh it (58:08 - 58:11)
was on (58:11 - 58:14)
shiftery wasn't it i don't remember (58:11 - 58:16)
because shiftery had the ability where (58:14 - 58:18)
if you played it (58:16 - 58:20)
down the person would have you flip a (58:18 - 58:22)
coin and if heads they pick up their (58:20 - 58:23)
their active pokemon but if they only (58:22 - 58:26)
had an active pokemon they lost the game (58:23 - 58:29)
yeah that would do it i think that i i i (58:26 - 58:30)
might be misremembering it but that (58:29 - 58:33)
shiftery card was (58:30 - 58:35)
not great well i mean it was great when (58:33 - 58:37)
it worked for you (58:35 - 58:39)
when you were playing it it was good (58:37 - 58:41)
when you were again this is (58:39 - 58:44)
everything in pokemon tcg it's it's good (58:41 - 58:45)
if it's making you win (58:44 - 58:48)
right correct is that how you say shift (58:45 - 58:49)
tree (58:48 - 58:52)
shift tree now you and i say it right (58:49 - 58:53)
shift tree shift array (58:52 - 58:56)
what did i say it's two syllables not (58:53 - 58:59)
three shift tree shift you keep saying (58:56 - 59:00)
shiftery (58:59 - 59:04)
shiftery i'm pulling out the pokedex (59:00 - 59:04)
how do you spell the thing where's the (59:08 - 59:13)
audio shift (59:11 - 59:18)
shift shiftery shifterry (59:13 - 59:18)
i thought it was like there was like a (59:29 - 59:33)
shifting card thing i'm like i don't (59:31 - 59:35)
it took me away from you shiftery no no (59:33 - 59:38)
no no no as always (59:35 - 59:39)
if i'm wrong in the show i will admit (59:38 - 59:41)
i'm wrong shift3 (59:39 - 59:44)
is how we say it here we have to say (59:41 - 59:45)

uh they don't a hundred percent feel (64:27 - 64:31)
like you're getting scammed (64:28 - 64:36)
well i mean they're just not a heart (64:31 - 64:37)
event you can just ignore it all (64:36 - 64:39)
together what do you mean (64:37 - 64:40)
i mean if you don't like the egg events (64:39 - 64:42)
just don't do eggs yeah i mean i'm not (64:40 - 64:46)
i mean i get eggs like i do things in (64:42 - 64:47)
the game it's like hey you got a bunch (64:46 - 64:48)
of eggs and then they (64:47 - 64:50)
are clogging up my temporary storage so (64:48 - 64:52)
that i put them in there (64:50 - 64:54)
but like most of the point most of the (64:52 - 64:55)
thing is (64:54 - 64:58)
i i do ignore them but it is a piece of (64:55 - 65:00)
the game that i think (64:58 - 65:02)
why is this even here what is this doing (65:00 - 65:04)
for us (65:02 - 65:06)
not a lot i don't think there's a single (65:04 - 65:07)
egg pokemon that (65:06 - 65:10)
feels like it can compete at the level (65:07 - 65:11)
of a (65:10 - 65:14)
like a four star or a five yeah i (65:11 - 65:16)
maybe argue some of the eggs are (65:14 - 65:18)
definitely better than three stars i'm (65:16 - 65:19)
looking at you (65:18 - 65:22)
soul rock and lunatone (65:19 - 65:25)
i think they're for me they're just fun (65:22 - 65:26)
to collect (65:25 - 65:28)
i just really like being like i got the (65:26 - 65:30)
you know this is a two week long event (65:28 - 65:30)
and (65:30 - 65:33)
i got the two shinies during the event (65:30 - 65:35)
and i did it cool (65:33 - 65:37)
so that's what it is for me it's just a (65:35 - 65:39)
collecting thing (65:37 - 65:41)
sure it's just not i mean yeah it's not (65:39 - 65:42)
that interesting (65:41 - 65:44)
yeah i mean maybe one day the the egg (65:42 - 65:46)
pokemon will be slightly better i did (65:44 - 65:49)
um i did want to (65:46 - 65:51)
you know i ended up spending eighty (65:49 - 65:54)
dollars in pokemon masters yeah (65:51 - 65:58)
what uh and what how is your sigma suit (65:54 - 65:59)
leaf pulse (65:58 - 66:03)
uh i don't wanna talk about it (65:59 - 66:05)
oh yeah because you know i got two and i (66:03 - 66:06)
got two blues (66:05 - 66:10)
yeah and i know i i pulled two (66:06 - 66:13)
leafs they uh were they the uh (66:10 - 66:15)
were they the eevees that are so good (66:13 - 66:16)
yeah they uh (66:15 - 66:20)
oh yeah evie is the loving-hearted (66:16 - 66:21)
pokemon according to the last press (66:20 - 66:24)
release i read (66:21 - 66:24)
so the first thing that got me to spend (66:25 - 66:28)
money ever in masters and (66:27 - 66:30)
for the i like we i just talked about (66:28 - 66:32)
magazine pokemon go i'm (66:30 - 66:34)
i'm very comfortable with spending money (66:32 - 66:35)
and wasting money (66:34 - 66:38)
so the problem with that is when you say (66:35 - 66:40)
things like that i look at the amount of (66:38 - 66:42)
money i spend on twitch subscriptions (66:40 - 66:45)
and slack patreon memberships and i'm (66:42 - 66:46)
like that's (66:45 - 66:49)
my money you're wasting yeah yeah but i (66:46 - 66:49)
can tell you (66:49 - 66:53)
together after 52 raids will we (66:49 - 66:56)
we together got a shiny deoxis (66:53 - 66:58)
i don't have no shiny deoxys no i don't (66:56 - 66:59)
either i'll trade you (66:58 - 67:02)
one of my regular d-axis that i got (66:59 - 67:03)
along the way (67:02 - 67:05)
i i do have a partnership with dna they (67:03 - 67:06)
do give me a stipend (67:05 - 67:09)
every month so i do get a couple extra (67:06 - 67:11)
free gems so it's not my money (67:09 - 67:14)
okay but they're not paid gems remember (67:11 - 67:15)
there's a difference between the free (67:14 - 67:16)
and the pay (67:15 - 67:19)
so when dna and uh the (67:16 - 67:21)
pokemon masters rolled out the egg stuff (67:19 - 67:22)
you could add an (67:21 - 67:24)
extra incubator so you get one free (67:22 - 67:26)
incubator just like pokemon go but you (67:24 - 67:27)
could add an (67:26 - 67:30)
extra permanent incubator you know (67:27 - 67:31)
the pokemon go community has been (67:30 - 67:34)
renting incubators for four years (67:31 - 67:36)
now that i'm thinking about it anyways (67:34 - 67:38)
you can buy a permanent incubator for i (67:36 - 67:40)
think it was like three bucks right greg (67:38 - 67:43)
like 300 gems three bucks 350 gems is (67:40 - 67:44)
pretty annoying something like that (67:43 - 67:46)
yeah i refuse to do it because i don't (67:44 - 67:49)
give them money uh and then the other (67:46 - 67:50)
thing you could do is you could upgrade (67:49 - 67:53)
your storage so you normally could hold (67:50 - 67:54)
four eggs but now you could hold eight (67:53 - 67:56)
eggs and that was like (67:54 - 67:58)
it was like a 180 gems or like a dollar (67:56 - 68:00)
fifty or something like that (67:58 - 68:03)
so all together two permanent things for (68:00 - 68:04)
eggs (68:03 - 68:07)
was like less than six or seven dollars (68:04 - 68:09)
and they were both permanent and then (68:07 - 68:11)
normally during events they give you an (68:09 - 68:13)
extra incubator which i think (68:11 - 68:15)
so greg you have two now right because (68:13 - 68:17)
you have the and that was like the (68:15 - 68:19)
i'm looking at the incubator right now (68:17 - 68:20)
that one lasts for 10 days and then (68:19 - 68:21)
there's a third (68:20 - 68:23)
option because there's four slots for (68:21 - 68:25)
incubators and the third option is a (68:23 - 68:28)
it's 500 gems and it's a temporary (68:25 - 68:29)
incubator that will (68:28 - 68:32)
auto hatch for you and will last exactly (68:29 - 68:34)
two weeks from when you buy it (68:32 - 68:38)
and i was like egg event is two weeks (68:34 - 68:40)
this bulbasaur charmander squirtle thing (68:38 - 68:41)
is two weeks (68:40 - 68:44)
i have three incubators i had i bought (68:41 - 68:45)
gems (68:44 - 68:49)
i can afford this 500 500 500 gem (68:45 - 68:50)
extra incubator i was like let's just (68:49 - 68:52)
try it right because then i can at least (68:50 - 68:53)
talk about it and educate (68:52 - 68:55)
other whether this is worth it to people (68:53 - 68:57)
or not so not only does it give you the (68:55 - 68:57)
fourth (68:57 - 69:00)
and final incubator um it also lets you (68:57 - 69:02)
queue up eggs (69:00 - 69:04)
i think greg would probably remember (69:02 - 69:05)
this from like clash royale (69:04 - 69:08)
if you bought the five dollar a month (69:05 - 69:09)
subscription (69:08 - 69:12)
you could cue a chest up i don't know if (69:09 - 69:12)
you remember that at all (69:12 - 69:15)
yeah yep yep so for those that don't get (69:12 - 69:17)
it so let's say i put four eggs in (69:15 - 69:19)
and they like let's say it's you know (69:17 - 69:21)
it's 4 p.m i put (69:19 - 69:23)
four eggs in they last 12 hours that (69:21 - 69:25)
means they hatch at 4am (69:23 - 69:27)
well you know i'm not getting up until a (69:25 - 69:29)
reasonable person maybe gets up at 8 or (69:27 - 69:30)
9 (69:29 - 69:31)
so they would be like oh you know those (69:30 - 69:33)
five hours of eggs not incubating what (69:31 - 69:34)
you can do is you can select (69:33 - 69:36)
four eggs in your inventory and you (69:34 - 69:38)
could say this is this is egg number one (69:36 - 69:39)
two three four (69:38 - 69:41)
and as soon as those eggs hatch in the (69:39 - 69:42)
middle of the night the four (69:41 - 69:44)
automatically go into your incubators (69:42 - 69:46)
and start incubating so (69:44 - 69:49)
you can hatch quicker um without always (69:46 - 69:51)
logging into the game (69:49 - 69:54)
is do i think that's worth 500 gems no (69:51 - 69:57)
no no i don't i don't no i think it's a (69:54 - 69:59)
little pricey i think if it was 500 gems (69:57 - 70:00)
for the month (69:59 - 70:02)
i would i think i would i could (70:00 - 70:03)
recommend it because then i'm just (70:02 - 70:04)
thinking like well (70:03 - 70:06)
you know if you play masters a lot five (70:04 - 70:07)
dollars a month for something that you (70:06 - 70:08)
like doing (70:07 - 70:11)
i think is reasonable that kind of leads (70:08 - 70:12)
me to believe that (70:11 - 70:15)
there are did we talk about this rumor (70:12 - 70:15)
that there was (70:15 - 70:17)
that when the mega evolution stuff was (70:15 - 70:19)
added to pokemon go (70:17 - 70:21)
that the data miners found that there (70:19 - 70:23)
was a baseline subscription service in (70:21 - 70:24)
pokemon go (70:23 - 70:27)
i think we might have mentioned that at (70:24 - 70:28)
some point (70:27 - 70:31)
there are two things in masters there's (70:28 - 70:31)
a uh (70:31 - 70:33)
there's the thing we talked about last (70:31 - 70:35)
week greg the gem bundle where like (70:33 - 70:35)
every day you log (70:35 - 70:37)
in you get the 50 and then there's the (70:35 - 70:39)
two week incubator (70:37 - 70:41)
um thing that you can buy and if we look (70:39 - 70:44)
at other nintendo games animal crossing (70:41 - 70:47)
fire emblem heroes uh mario kart they (70:44 - 70:48)
all have subscriptions (70:47 - 70:51)
and i i think i don't think anyone would (70:48 - 70:52)
be i don't think anyone on the show (70:51 - 70:53)
would be surprised if (70:52 - 70:55)
both pokemon go and masters has a (70:53 - 70:57)
subscription (70:55 - 71:00)
eventually and whether and i think (70:57 - 71:01)
specifically with masters (71:00 - 71:04)
it would be the egg thing and it would (71:01 - 71:05)
probably be the gem thing (71:04 - 71:08)
they were merged together into one would (71:05 - 71:09)
be my guess (71:08 - 71:10)
i don't know what it would be for (71:09 - 71:13)
pokemon go uh i don't either (71:10 - 71:15)
like i mean you could get incubators in (71:13 - 71:16)
pokemon go (71:15 - 71:18)
yeah that's true yeah that's true uh (71:16 - 71:20)
yeah the pokemon go could have it where (71:18 - 71:21)
you know if you pay 10 (71:20 - 71:22)
a month you get a second permanent (71:21 - 71:24)
incubator as long as you pay that money (71:22 - 71:26)
i think literally every hardcore fan (71:24 - 71:28)
would probably do that (71:26 - 71:31)
and also remember that they can take (71:28 - 71:32)
stuff away (71:31 - 71:34)
so they could start a subscription (71:32 - 71:36)
service and then make pokestops less (71:34 - 71:37)
generous (71:36 - 71:41)
or gifts less generous or start a (71:37 - 71:42)
subscription service and say you get (71:41 - 71:45)
bonus items from the pokestops (71:42 - 71:47)
which please don't well that was number (71:45 - 71:48)
one i wouldn't need that because my bag (71:47 - 71:50)
is always full that was well that's the (71:48 - 71:51)
thing with the gem bundle in (71:50 - 71:54)
um masters is when you get it not only (71:51 - 71:56)
do you get gems by logging in every day (71:54 - 71:59)
but you also get like bonus sync orbs (71:56 - 72:00)
and sync herbs are pretty sought after (71:59 - 72:01)
right now (72:00 - 72:03)
great do you play any gotcha games that (72:01 - 72:05)
have subscription services (72:03 - 72:09)
um does drag algae lost have one (72:05 - 72:12)
no no it doesn't nope they're still (72:09 - 72:15)
gems but they're i i've never seen one i (72:12 - 72:18)
can't think of a one that i've made it (72:15 - 72:19)
playing them that long where they've (72:18 - 72:21)
switched over to a subscription service (72:19 - 72:25)
pokemon dude yeah but i didn't play that (72:21 - 72:26)
that long yeah but like two months (72:25 - 72:27)
before they just (72:26 - 72:31)
killed the game yeah um i feel like (72:27 - 72:32)
subscription services and mobile games (72:31 - 72:34)
like the last ditch (72:32 - 72:38)
effort say that it's saved clash royale (72:34 - 72:41)
you don't think say it though well (72:38 - 72:45)
shout out to jyn uh oh so we (72:41 - 72:49)
we had a pkmn cast clash royale (72:45 - 72:51)
guild clan whatever it was called it was (72:49 - 72:54)
like me greg logan was in it (72:51 - 72:56)
yeah we had a lot of people but then a (72:54 - 72:58)
lot of people right and then over time (72:56 - 72:59)
you know people stopped playing clash (72:58 - 73:01)
royale you could have a max of 50. (72:59 - 73:03)
and at one point we were just full we (73:01 - 73:04)
couldn't accept any new people (73:03 - 73:06)
yeah so i would i would end up kicking (73:04 - 73:07)
people who haven't played in like two or (73:06 - 73:08)
three weeks (73:07 - 73:10)
so we could get more people in at a (73:08 - 73:12)
certain point then we couldn't get full (73:10 - 73:14)
we were just at like 40 always which is (73:12 - 73:16)
like fine we had like 40 people (73:14 - 73:18)
and then the thing i think that killed (73:16 - 73:20)
it for a lot of players (73:18 - 73:22)
ironically everyone in this guild were (73:20 - 73:24)
pokemon players (73:22 - 73:27)
was uh just this really tiny indie game (73:24 - 73:29)
called sword and shield came out (73:27 - 73:31)
yep and that was the last time i really (73:29 - 73:32)
played clash royale (73:31 - 73:35)
i would play clash royale a little bit (73:32 - 73:36)
at work but (73:35 - 73:39)
ultimately what killed it is when (73:36 - 73:42)
i had to start working from home other (73:39 - 73:42)
games (73:42 - 73:45)
that are just better it was fun to do it (73:42 - 73:47)
was fun to jump in and do like a quick (73:45 - 73:49)
two minute battle and clash royale (73:47 - 73:51)
on my work break but now that i can go (73:49 - 73:53)
downstairs somewhere break and (73:51 - 73:55)
do raids and sword shield or anything (73:53 - 73:57)
else it was just like this game isn't (73:55 - 73:58)
that fun (73:57 - 74:00)
and i think ultimately i dropped it (73:58 - 74:01)
because (74:00 - 74:04)
it wasn't that fun it was just a time (74:01 - 74:07)
filler and once that spell was broken i (74:04 - 74:07)
was like well (74:07 - 74:10)
i'm out i you know i don't need i don't (74:07 - 74:11)
want to play this anymore it's just not (74:10 - 74:12)
an interesting game (74:11 - 74:14)
and they started doing weird (74:12 - 74:16)
subscription things and (74:14 - 74:18)
season passes yeah i thought they're (74:16 - 74:20)
five dollars a month for what they were (74:18 - 74:22)
offering i thought it was good (74:20 - 74:25)
it was okay oh my gosh (74:22 - 74:28)
well you got uh you got the chest (74:25 - 74:29)
queuing (74:28 - 74:32)
you got chest cueing and you sometimes (74:29 - 74:33)
got interesting (74:32 - 74:36)
tower designs a lot of the towers items (74:33 - 74:37)
were bad (74:36 - 74:40)
yeah so ultimately i was like (74:37 - 74:43)
why am i spending money on this uh but (74:40 - 74:44)
yeah pokemon duel switched to a (74:43 - 74:45)
subscription (74:44 - 74:49)
like two months before they closed (74:45 - 74:51)
uh and their subscription was not good (74:49 - 74:53)
at all (74:51 - 74:55)
and i think it was like 14 a month and (74:53 - 74:56)
when you did it you got like a shiny (74:55 - 74:57)
celebi (74:56 - 74:58)
and then they were like you can pull any (74:57 - 75:01)
five star that you're missing and (74:58 - 75:05)
uh it wasn't particularly (75:01 - 75:08)
great oh but oh (75:05 - 75:11)
my sorry so sword and shield came out (75:08 - 75:13)
and i was like (75:11 - 75:14)
and then clash royale yelled at me and (75:13 - 75:16)
they were like you're the leader of this (75:14 - 75:18)
clan if you don't log in it's gonna go (75:16 - 75:19)
to somebody else (75:18 - 75:21)
and i was like well this isn't fair to (75:19 - 75:22)
the people in the clan right (75:21 - 75:25)
i'm going to you know i'm going to give (75:22 - 75:26)
it to jyn (75:25 - 75:28)
in our slack been a supporter of a long (75:26 - 75:30)
time shout out and then (75:28 - 75:31)
jyn will be leader jin can make the (75:30 - 75:33)
decision if people need to leave or come (75:31 - 75:35)
or go (75:33 - 75:37)
uh and all that stuff because they were (75:35 - 75:39)
number one in our client anyways too (75:37 - 75:41)
they're very very good at the game (75:39 - 75:43)
and clash royale just released a brand (75:41 - 75:44)
new huge overhaul (75:43 - 75:47)
update running ads for it i saw it on (75:44 - 75:49)
instagram and i was like ah (75:47 - 75:51)
you know what i got a little down time i (75:49 - 75:52)
can't fall asleep (75:51 - 75:54)
let's check out some clash royale (75:52 - 75:56)
installed the update (75:54 - 75:59)
go into the game and (75:56 - 76:02)
i i almost wanted to like cry because (75:59 - 76:06)
the thing that i went into was like (76:02 - 76:09)
30 messages of people leaving the clan (76:06 - 76:11)
and then it was all of like the top (76:09 - 76:13)
players in our clan like saying goodbye (76:11 - 76:14)
to each other they're like ah thank you (76:13 - 76:16)
so much for the memories it was really (76:14 - 76:17)
fun to battle with you (76:16 - 76:20)
oh great job jen really appreciate what (76:17 - 76:21)
you did here hey i'm gonna go to an (76:20 - 76:23)
active clan but i loved you guys (76:21 - 76:25)
it was just all these like really nice (76:23 - 76:27)
messages and then i like look (76:25 - 76:28)
and the only like two people left in the (76:27 - 76:30)
clan are like me and greg who haven't (76:28 - 76:33)
logged in and like (76:30 - 76:35)
i was like i can't play this game (76:33 - 76:36)
because we need a clan (76:35 - 76:39)
and there's no clown anymore i deleted (76:36 - 76:41)
it off my phone is that my final goodbye (76:39 - 76:44)
after you texted me that i'm like oh (76:41 - 76:45)
well i'm out (76:44 - 76:47)
delete shout out to everyone who played (76:45 - 76:48)
clash royale (76:47 - 76:51)
with us you know in retrospect we (76:48 - 76:53)
you know in retrospect we were talking (76:51 - 76:55)
about like harry potter coming out (76:53 - 76:58)
and whether or not pokemon go players (76:55 - 77:00)
will move to harry potter (76:58 - 77:03)
it's it's it's so interesting that (77:00 - 77:05)
people will stick with the game just (77:03 - 77:06)
because their friends are playing the (77:05 - 77:06)
game (77:06 - 77:10)
yeah and as soon as you have no one (77:06 - 77:10)
playing (77:10 - 77:14)
that game like even if i really wanted (77:10 - 77:16)
to play clash royale i don't (77:14 - 77:18)
i can't i'd have to like try to get (77:16 - 77:20)
people to join and (77:18 - 77:24)
it's put it's just a lot of work yeah (77:20 - 77:32)
it's a lot of work for not a lot of fun (77:24 - 77:32)
so that should become a clash royale (77:32 - 77:37)
streamer and then yes that's true (77:34 - 77:40)
uh so egg event is happening right now (77:37 - 77:44)
we do not know when the (77:40 - 77:47)
family event is starting sometime before (77:44 - 77:49)
the end of september (77:47 - 77:52)
right they said september so i thought (77:49 - 77:53)
it was the 14th (77:52 - 77:56)
or something so that would be lucine (77:53 - 77:59)
gladion and lily assuming number 64 (77:56 - 78:01)
that's when it's coming out ah the 64th (77:59 - 78:03)
of september yeah assuming that lucy (78:01 - 78:06)
loves um lily is the one lily and (78:03 - 78:08)
clefairy was already shown in the (78:06 - 78:09)
trailer (78:08 - 78:11)
however long ago so that's happening (78:09 - 78:13)
right now for masters (78:11 - 78:15)
i don't think anyone's complaining about (78:13 - 78:17)
stanimal right now (78:15 - 78:19)
no because you're getting a lot yeah (78:17 - 78:21)
they're giving you a whole lot (78:19 - 78:23)
uh i also noticed and then once it dries (78:21 - 78:25)
up everybody complaining about it again (78:23 - 78:27)
uh i also noticed the current egg event (78:25 - 78:30)
is only 10 instead of 20. yeah (78:27 - 78:33)
which is what it should be oh yeah (78:30 - 78:34)
across the board (78:33 - 78:36)
well the last thing i want to talk about (78:34 - 78:38)
before we go to question of the week (78:36 - 78:41)
is um sensory tower (78:38 - 78:44)
which reports on app revenue money i'm (78:41 - 78:47)
not 100 sure how they get it but (78:44 - 78:50)
is this a weird website sensory sensory (78:47 - 78:52)
they always we've talked about them (78:50 - 78:53)
before they always do like app data (78:52 - 78:54)
stuff (78:53 - 78:57)
not including pokemon go on this chart (78:54 - 78:59)
but these are all the other pokemon (78:57 - 79:03)
games on mobile magikarp jump in the (78:59 - 79:03)
first (79:03 - 79:08)
year of spending we thought in 2020 we'd (79:03 - 79:10)
be talking about magikarp jump (79:08 - 79:13)
uh made five million dollars (79:10 - 79:15)
pokemon that's impressive pokemon quest (79:13 - 79:16)
liquor (79:15 - 79:18)
yeah yeah magikarp temples wait magikarp (79:16 - 79:23)
you had to make choices (79:18 - 79:25)
they were random choices but sure uh it (79:23 - 79:27)
does say this revenue (79:25 - 79:29)
does not include revenue from third (79:27 - 79:31)
party android stores (79:29 - 79:33)
so i think if those from google play are (79:31 - 79:35)
good i don't know can you even get these (79:33 - 79:37)
games in third party inter (79:35 - 79:40)
android stores sure apparently maybe (79:37 - 79:43)
pokemon quest made 10 million dollars in (79:40 - 79:45)
its first year (79:43 - 79:48)
pretty good pokemon (79:45 - 79:52)
shuffle made 11 million dollars (79:48 - 79:57)
pokemon duel made 14 million dollars (79:52 - 80:02)
and finally pokemon masters at 75 (79:57 - 80:05)
million dollars which is a lot more than (80:02 - 80:06)
the other ones (80:05 - 80:09)
and what's not on there pokemon go which (80:06 - 80:10)
is weird because they've reported on (80:09 - 80:12)
pokemon go stuff before so i'm not sure (80:10 - 80:12)
why (80:12 - 80:16)
they couldn't do it for this data (80:12 - 80:18)
that i'm not sure of yeah it's just like (80:16 - 80:19)
a weird (80:18 - 80:21)
well i we don't need the pokemon go data (80:19 - 80:24)
we know that pokemon goes number one (80:21 - 80:26)
yeah but like billions and billions it's (80:24 - 80:28)
good to put it in perspective (80:26 - 80:31)
yes like how much did they make their (80:28 - 80:34)
first year it wasn't it like (80:31 - 80:34)
207 million yeah i think it was like (80:34 - 80:40)
at least 200 million so (80:37 - 80:45)
it's leaving that out is (80:40 - 80:48)
semi-important like okay (80:45 - 80:51)
there was another pokemon go that was (80:48 - 80:53)
vastly vastly vastly more (80:51 - 80:56)
popular than masters is yeah and does (80:53 - 80:59)
double did double the money masters did (80:56 - 81:00)
in the first year (80:59 - 81:02)
like that is kind of important context (81:00 - 81:04)
it's not saying that pokemon masters (81:02 - 81:07)
isn't doing well but like it's just (81:04 - 81:08)
weird that they would leave that (81:07 - 81:10)
out when they're gonna go with magikarp (81:08 - 81:11)
jump (81:10 - 81:15)
again everybody knows nobody played (81:11 - 81:18)
what what i played magikarp jumping they (81:15 - 81:18)
gotta (81:18 - 81:21)
ever pay for anything on it i did i did (81:18 - 81:22)
the (81:21 - 81:25)
five dollar welcome bundle magikarp jump (81:22 - 81:28)
i don't think was ever designed to like (81:25 - 81:30)
i don't i think if any if there was any (81:28 - 81:34)
innocent game in the history of (81:30 - 81:34)
true i agree magikarp jump was very very (81:35 - 81:38)
innocent (81:37 - 81:39)
and the main reason i gave it five (81:38 - 81:41)
dollars was just because i was genuinely (81:39 - 81:42)
having a good time (81:41 - 81:44)
with it and i was like well i want the (81:42 - 81:45)
developers to see something (81:44 - 81:48)
and apparently they saw enough because (81:45 - 81:49)
we know the people who are making (81:48 - 81:50)
magikarp jump (81:49 - 81:52)
people who made magikarp jump are making (81:50 - 81:53)
pokemon sleep (81:52 - 81:55)
uh this is this is the interesting (81:53 - 81:57)
conversation is (81:55 - 82:01)
you have a game like pokemon duel (81:57 - 82:05)
which they desperately tried to save (82:01 - 82:06)
multiple times (82:05 - 82:10)
they reworked the mechanics they (82:06 - 82:12)
cleaned up the menus they they changed a (82:10 - 82:14)
lot of it to the point where they're (82:12 - 82:14)
like we launched a (82:14 - 82:16)
14 a month subscription service that was (82:14 - 82:18)
completely garbage that (82:16 - 82:20)
clearly no one signed up for and then (82:18 - 82:21)
they shut down (82:20 - 82:23)
and it made in total 14 million dollars (82:21 - 82:25)
in its first year (82:23 - 82:28)
and i think a game that is pretty well (82:25 - 82:29)
loved (82:28 - 82:30)
and a game that people won't shut up (82:29 - 82:33)
about for sequels is pokemon quest (82:30 - 82:35)
till this day people are still like (82:33 - 82:37)
where's the gen 2 of pokemon quest (82:35 - 82:39)
i mean 10 million dollars is a lot of (82:37 - 82:41)
money (82:39 - 82:44)
i mean also keep in mind that (82:41 - 82:46)
gamefreak who made pokemon quests they (82:44 - 82:49)
also sold (82:46 - 82:54)
14 million copies of black and white (82:49 - 82:56)
and they made 10 million dollars with (82:54 - 82:58)
pokemon quest (82:56 - 83:00)
i don't know if there would ever be a (82:58 - 83:01)
sequel to quest (83:00 - 83:03)
i mean there could be could be sure they (83:01 - 83:06)
need the time in the interest to do it (83:03 - 83:08)
i don't think i don't think gen 2 i (83:06 - 83:10)
don't think adding 100 pokemon requests (83:08 - 83:12)
in some more levels makes quest any more (83:10 - 83:13)
interesting though i think quest was a (83:12 - 83:14)
good (83:13 - 83:18)
short fun game and and honestly it works (83:14 - 83:19)
for (83:18 - 83:22)
the first set of pokemon right coming (83:19 - 83:24)
having spoiler having mewtwo be the (83:22 - 83:26)
final thing that you battle (83:24 - 83:30)
kind of like makes sense but (83:26 - 83:32)
yeah there's not really any what how can (83:30 - 83:33)
you celebrate (83:32 - 83:36)
in do something equivalent that's a (83:33 - 83:38)
celebi thing celebi's not mad (83:36 - 83:40)
mewtwo is always mad yeah mitchu's got (83:38 - 83:43)
anger issues always has always will (83:40 - 83:46)
i mean unjustifiably so (83:43 - 83:48)
pokemon shuffle at that 11 million (83:46 - 83:51)
though pokemon travel was a good game (83:48 - 83:54)
pokemon shuffle was a good game pokemon (83:51 - 83:56)
shuffle two (83:54 - 83:57)
yeah i mean they just gotta rip off what (83:56 - 83:59)
gardenscapes is doing and we'll (83:57 - 84:02)
be back how about pokemon uh (83:59 - 84:05)
pull the key where's that game (84:02 - 84:10)
no no no no no no no no (84:05 - 84:13)
i'm putting my foot down right on that (84:10 - 84:13)
direct pikachu's lightning (84:14 - 84:20)
through this key system question of the (84:17 - 84:22)
week (84:20 - 84:22)
i love the questions i love the queries (84:23 - 84:32)
of the question of the week yeah (84:26 - 84:34)
sounds like a show tune all right this (84:32 - 84:35)
one is from (84:34 - 84:39)
kevin from our slack says (84:35 - 84:42)
have you learned any real world facts (84:39 - 84:44)
and knowledge because of pokemon (84:42 - 84:49)
yeah i have one i'll go last though (84:44 - 84:52)
because it's embarrassing no now you (84:49 - 84:53)
have to go first (84:52 - 84:56)
facts because of pokemon (84:53 - 84:59)
i i learned that um (84:56 - 85:02)
delicious uh onigiri rice balls (84:59 - 85:14)
are called donuts in japan (85:02 - 85:14)
oh boy i mean i learned a lot about (85:15 - 85:22)
um forget how (85:19 - 85:24)
what it's called there's this particular (85:22 - 85:27)
plant that is poisonous (85:24 - 85:30)
uh that disguises itself as that looks (85:27 - 85:31)
like roses which is where (85:30 - 85:34)
the masquerade of rose raid came from (85:31 - 85:36)
i have to remember what it's called but (85:34 - 85:38)
anyways that whole the whole like design (85:36 - 85:41)
and how it was based off of an entire uh (85:38 - 85:43)
series of poisonous flowers (85:41 - 85:47)
um and they are very similar to roses (85:43 - 85:50)
is basically the design concept behind (85:47 - 85:52)
rosarite which is really super (85:50 - 85:54)
it was like an interesting thing to (85:52 - 85:56)
learn about flowers because i didn't (85:54 - 85:57)
know (85:56 - 86:00)
all that stuff so i mean there's a bunch (85:57 - 86:02)
of like weird (86:00 - 86:02)
what is this based off of stuff that (86:02 - 86:06)
i've learned like (86:04 - 86:07)
yeah yeah that's i think that's where i (86:06 - 86:09)
get a lot of it as well (86:07 - 86:12)
like the is it azural that's that (86:09 - 86:14)
changes gender because that's based off (86:12 - 86:16)
of the (86:14 - 86:20)
frog that does or the fish that does (86:16 - 86:21)
like there's all those little weird (86:20 - 86:22)
flags (86:21 - 86:26)
that are super cool that i'm like yeah (86:22 - 86:29)
what's your one steve go go go (86:26 - 86:33)
okay i'm gonna i i'm confident (86:29 - 86:36)
in my ability as both a podcaster (86:33 - 86:38)
and an uneducated person to blow (86:36 - 86:40)
somebody's mind (86:38 - 86:44)
here the hop-up line (86:40 - 86:44)
no no back away from the edge (86:45 - 86:52)
no i can take it i can tell all right so (86:49 - 86:53)
it's a hop (86:52 - 86:55)
hoppip skip loom i mean i know where (86:53 - 86:56)
this is jump fluff (86:55 - 86:59)
right so number one is it's hop skip (86:56 - 87:03)
jump hop it skip loom jump fluff number (86:59 - 87:04)
two (87:03 - 87:06)
is it's the entire evolution of a (87:04 - 87:08)
dandelion (87:06 - 87:11)
and i didn't know until somebody pointed (87:08 - 87:12)
this out (87:11 - 87:15)
that the yellow dandelion is the same as (87:12 - 87:16)
the white (87:15 - 87:19)
fluffy dandelion and i didn't know they (87:16 - 87:20)
were the same plant (87:19 - 87:23)
until that i did not know (87:20 - 87:26)
that that's where this was going and you (87:23 - 87:26)
have (87:26 - 87:30)
blown my mind (87:26 - 87:33)
the weed and then skip looms the yellow (87:30 - 87:35)
dandelion and then jump fluff is the (87:33 - 87:37)
fluffy dandelion but i didn't know the (87:35 - 87:40)
fluffy one was a dandelion until like (87:37 - 87:42)
two years ago (87:40 - 87:43)
i thought you're thinking it was a (87:42 - 87:46)
different place (87:43 - 87:50)
okay okay okay i'm going to give you (87:46 - 87:52)
i i'm going to ask a question that's (87:50 - 87:54)
going to help shed light (87:52 - 87:57)
how obsessive was your family (87:54 - 88:01)
about your lawn we didn't have a lawn (87:57 - 88:03)
okay yeah we didn't really have a lawn (88:01 - 88:05)
we took care of but wait didn't you ever (88:03 - 88:06)
pick one up (88:05 - 88:08)
and like blow yeah yeah totally yeah did (88:06 - 88:10)

flower the puff flowers right flowers (88:13 - 88:17)
you don't learn dandelions or weeds (88:16 - 88:18)
until you're like (88:17 - 88:20)
six you just think they're flowers when (88:18 - 88:21)
you're looking for look (88:20 - 88:24)
look look look weed is a human term okay (88:21 - 88:26)
a plant is a plant (88:24 - 88:28)
just because you don't like it doesn't (88:26 - 88:29)
make it a bad thing (88:28 - 88:32)
friend i will give you this i only knew (88:29 - 88:34)
that because (88:32 - 88:37)
when growing up with fairly large yards (88:34 - 88:40)
uh you would watch them change right (88:37 - 88:41)
like i don't think of a time (88:40 - 88:43)
when i was taught in school the life (88:41 - 88:46)
cycle of a dandelion (88:43 - 88:48)
i could see if you never had them in (88:46 - 88:50)
your yard or a yard to watch them change (88:48 - 88:52)
over no no no but like (88:50 - 88:58)
i i know at times in my life (88:52 - 89:01)
do you want to blow on the dandelion (88:58 - 89:05)
right it's just like because you name (89:01 - 89:07)
the thing that you pick from the ground (89:05 - 89:08)
and blow on (89:07 - 89:11)
all right could i can i can i wha what (89:08 - 89:13)

grass area we could play in (90:39 - 90:44)
it was just a huge cement probably used (90:41 - 90:45)
to be a parking lot (90:44 - 90:48)
so you needed to grow up in hawaii and (90:45 - 90:49)
then they put like some (90:48 - 90:52)
basketball hoops that didn't really have (90:49 - 90:53)
hoops (90:52 - 90:55)
i don't you know what i'm talking about (90:53 - 90:56)
they didn't have nets yeah they didn't (90:55 - 90:56)
have (90:56 - 91:00)
nets okay didn't have nets like (90:56 - 91:03)
it was just a board without a hoop yes (91:00 - 91:06)
you don't have dandelions in hawaii (91:03 - 91:09)
yeah they do oh do they now no yeah oh (91:06 - 91:11)
we're get wrecked (91:09 - 91:13)
dandelions are everywhere man yeah maybe (91:11 - 91:15)
that was part of the problem (91:13 - 91:17)
and i didn't i didn't have like i mean i (91:15 - 91:18)
had school (91:17 - 91:20)
friends as a kid but my parents were (91:18 - 91:22)
like oh you you (91:20 - 91:24)
you're not allowed to leave the house (91:22 - 91:26)
i'm very strict (91:24 - 91:30)
i was very sheltered as a kid (91:26 - 91:34)
oh that's okay that's okay (91:30 - 91:37)
we are we are expanding your horizons (91:34 - 91:41)
as your um adopted (91:37 - 91:43)
uncles because i'm definitely not gonna (91:41 - 91:44)
be your dad look (91:43 - 91:48)
it's fair pokemon of the week all right (91:44 - 91:51)
so last week's pokemon um (91:48 - 91:55)
so the one thing that i was not (91:51 - 91:58)
straightforward about (91:55 - 92:02)
but i did describe that was possibly a (91:58 - 92:04)
key to figuring out (92:02 - 92:08)
the solution in north america (92:04 - 92:11)
i'm not gonna hold mexico and canada (92:08 - 92:12)
accountable (92:11 - 92:14)
i i will say it's probably just us in (92:12 - 92:16)
the united states but potentially in (92:14 - 92:18)
canada as well (92:16 - 92:21)
we are the only part of the world where (92:18 - 92:24)
vultures and buzzards are considered to (92:21 - 92:26)
be the same bird (92:24 - 92:29)
in the rest of the world buzzards (92:26 - 92:33)
and hawks are considered to be the same (92:29 - 92:34)
bird (92:33 - 92:36)
which if you've ever seen a vulture and (92:34 - 92:38)
you've ever seen a huak (92:36 - 92:39)
you know that they look nothing like (92:38 - 92:41)
this (92:39 - 92:43)
[Laughter] (92:41 - 92:45)
like what is wrong there but for some (92:43 - 92:48)
reason the word buzzard when it got over (92:45 - 92:49)
here (92:48 - 92:53)
got applied to two vultures (92:49 - 92:56)
um and i mean you had if you wanted to (92:53 - 92:57)
look up (92:56 - 93:00)
right the king gizzard and the lizard (92:57 - 93:01)
wizard and find out (93:00 - 93:03)
their nonagon infinity album and the (93:01 - 93:05)
fourth what was it the fourth song (93:03 - 93:07)
is like person vulture or people (93:05 - 93:09)
vultures so that would have given you (93:07 - 93:11)
that hint (93:09 - 93:14)
uh and then the last part (93:11 - 93:17)
was about the part of your mouth that (93:14 - 93:18)
holds your teeth (93:17 - 93:21)
which is confusing because birds don't (93:18 - 93:22)
have teeth but (93:21 - 93:24)
the top and bottom of their beak are (93:22 - 93:25)
actually called (93:24 - 93:29)
by the word mandible (93:25 - 93:29)
so (93:35 - 93:38)
you (93:40 - 93:42)
