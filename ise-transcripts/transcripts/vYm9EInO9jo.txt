[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the two 422 and forty eight fifth episode four five hundred and twenty fourth two five of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj back again with me is greg i am here i have ring fit adventure i am excited to change this over to ring fit cast i will be talking about the best boss strats for your abs i'm i'm excited that they've reprinted it so i could not pay 180 for it i remember a simpler time where i brought up ring fit adventure and then two people on the show made fun of me yeah we had gyms like actual fitness to do that is not a thing anymore so i have to go to what you lesser people do which is actively work in my in the front of my living room with my dogs i mean my gym is open yeah my tip's up and now but it's getting a little crowded for my tastes so i'm gonna take a couple days off yeah do ring fit i see will is here i have recently discovered that my life is actually a slice of life japanese anime oh it is yes it certainly is my roommate the cat is the one that comes to bring to my mind no because in that one the cat is really nice my cat is not nice no uh i don't know if you've seen it um and it's also mature audiences only but highly recommended uh rascal does not dream of bunny senpai bunny girl senpai actually poor very poorly named very good anime but that's the closest approximation of my life right there do you do you have a bunny senpai in your life do i have a bunny girl senpai hmm i would have to say no because yeah no no i'm more like the if anybody has watched rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai uh i am like the physics science club girl that that is my role is this on crunchyroll that's on hulu well speaking of hulu we're gonna there's no weather steve how do you think about that around the news look i knew you guys were gonna maybe talk about weather we didn't that's because we talked about it before we maybe gonna do something it's a world of infinite possibilities we may have decided to talk about i don't know insulin how's your insulin i mean mine's fine actually surprisingly brent's fine as well we thought it would be real bad because we are not eating well but we're back in track so insulin in this house is a-okay how's that pokemon news we got we got we got some pokemon go news we got some tcg news and we got some masters news and i guess we got some sword and shield news but it's already over there was just some promotional stuff that came and went big breath here we go let's talk about pokemon go [Music] so okay the somewhat relevant will anderson complaint about pokemon go of the week all right i have recently learned that you know how when you start pokemon go and they have i will call it a pop-up that is the news item yeah yeah that pops up if you do not click to read that news item it stays on that news item problem a so if for say 30 days you do not click on that news item it will be a 30 day old news item problem b they only present them to you in sequential order yes once you do click to read 30 day old news item and you log in tomorrow the next news item you see is the 29 day old news item and you've got to eventually get through them until you're caught up rather than them saying hey he's never going to read this let's just cancel it and get to the irrelevant one this is why you don't have victini because niantic knew that you were not victorious in reading the news i was literally getting news items about pokemon go fest last week [Laughter] yeah that sounds right yeah you have to have those i saw that they uh apologized about mega something or others made changes yeah we'll get to that is that is the the hot topic though what's the hot gas yeah what's the the the do do do that's that's the news flash yeah that's the news flash this episode [Music] [Laughter] isn't it like the 50th anniversary of mario or 35th mario's like a million years old mario existed before time itself there has always been mario there always will be mario long live mario september community day is porygon not mario porygon is september 20th uh from 11 to five so it's another six hour event on a sunday if you're lucky trainers you may find shiny porygon triple the xp for catching uh during the community uh and after community up to two hours if you evolve porygon 2. into porygon z porygon z will learn the community exclusive move tri-attack it is a normal type of attack that can lower the opposing pokemon's attack and defense which i guess would be good for go battle league september will also feature a special community day research story which will be available for the low low price of one dollar and then uh charmander will be featured for the october community as voted on by the community so just a heads up is the fire lizard yeah heads up of community day stuff the other thing we got to ah this is off bleeding cool.com never really heard of this website but they have a nice little list of course they've been around for a long time like bleeding cool news they do have a breaking news thing at the top of their website it does say breaking news and then it says super mario odyssey marvel's avengers always sunny star trek assassin's creed manga justice league smackdown pokemon go star wars smackdown again smackdown deadpool wait what there's no breaking news for star trek maybe yeah there is there's a new series oh okay well that's why i i should maybe read bleeding cool more often i didn't know you should double smackdown though do you ever watch star trek i watch i the first star trek i really watched was that movie the the one with the lens flare oh talk about like thinking that a taco is made with a hot dog and what you don't like this i do okay fundamental premise of that movie is that they erased the entire history of all star trek that had gone before it unforgivable yeah i saw that movie that's not why we're on bleeding cool we're on here because they have a list of all the unova pokemon not released yet oh the ones that have not been added to pokemon go yet are muna and musharna if i was a betting person which i'm not because i i think i've been wrong on this show way too many times to count but because they're the dream pokemon you would think and they already announced something called pokemon sleep you would think that would be maybe a tie-in pokemon sleep doesn't exist it's i'm yeah i get sure yeah yeah period it's vaporware that would be my only guess for those unless they're just like here's a psychic weak event we added musharna like okay sure i i mean i could say 50 yes i agree with you that it could be a tie into pokemon sleep but also as far as i recall in black and white and black and white too the uh muna musharnas were somewhat special in the way that you had to get them like one would only show up once a week or something like that um in the dream yard specifically in the dream well but it would only show up like on like wednesdays in the dream yard or something that they might man why don't they do fun stuff like that anymore either way they might just put it in raids or have like a special research task that you have to do that can be completed on wednesdays i mean that was eight years ago nine years ago something like that well i mean the other thing they did with muna and musharna besides the dreamy art stuff was they like used it to advertise the dream world yeah which i missed stream world confirmed sandile crocodrock and crocodile oh you think crocorrock's one of those words that like go players have no clue how to say yes crocodile makes sense if you watch the anime because it's in the anime a lot and ash says it a lot but are they going to have the right sunglasses this time no they don't care about the sunglasses well i had every public niantic person on twitter and asked them about glasses but will anderson wants to know will crocker rock have the right sunglasses this time glasses watch didn't sandal have the sunglasses too it was stand out it was the sand dial first it was the whole line yeah the whole line a whole line had glasses but i mean the whole thing was like the the the was it the ducklits that stole everything and then they stole the sandal sunglasses and then there was the whole thing where there was a flood and all the sand dials like they bit each other's tails to make a bridge and then ash didn't die and it was great maybe the black and white anime was good it was good if you look at the pieces yeah don't look at the ugly puzzle look at the beautiful pieces it does it does have the beyblade rival that beats ash ah there's there were no spinning tops in pokemon uh zarua and zoroark also not in the game i mean they may be we just don't know right it's like the ditto problem yeah yeah man they treated zoroark like a legendary pokemon in black and white and then they were like here's one you could just catch them in black and white too right yeah yeah because in black and white you had to get you had to show a person yeah young lady in the camper trailer right no no they were it was a dude inside castellia city and he's like wait um he wants to see a shiny raikou and tay or suicune and if you show him one of those he gives you zoro zurua i'm pretty sure you had to bring the three because it was a tie into the movie yeah yeah so you had to bring this maybe okay so i don't remember maybe you did show it there but then you had to go to a certain section of like the forgotten forest and then you would have the zoroark encounter there i don't think you could catch that one though no that was the distribution that's how you did it because i had to hack a zorro arc so i could get one [Laughter] look it was a long time ago different times i didn't have friends how is that different times what you stuck how dare you okay i got the details all right the deets all right so both will and i were correct i thought of this conversation because i barely remember that game in castelia city if you showed the person a celebi they would give you a zarua there on the spot and i remember because it puts it into whatever pokeball is in your inventory i remember testing this on twitch so if you throw away all your pokeballs and you only have a master ball it puts the zerua into your master ball which is a fun thing to test let me just you know reset your game i mean does it take the first one in the list so i can get rid of everything but luxury balls and master balls that we'll say where's your science now steve that i don't remember and then you could get the zoroart zoroark in black and white and lost lauren forrest but that requires the shot the the shiny encounter with entei raikko or sweet [ __ ] which they gave out at gamestop at the time yeah um so those are the two ways to get it uh in black and white two it looks like the only way you could get zarua was getting enz zarua was that does not just wandering around somewhere yeah and then you caught it and then it said it was owned by n and then of course all of this gets thrown out the window when you could easily take whatever zero you got you breed it you give it to people and then they breed it and they give it to people yeah and so on and so on and so on do you remember how when you used to capture catch ends pokemon and then they would have like a little sparkle that would come out when they like and you'd be like oh it's a shiny and then yeah no it's actually just ends pokemon there was a point when i was thinking i was going to catch all of n's pokemon and then i didn't care exactly same same thing vanilla vanillish vanillux are not in the game and i don't know why they should be uh waiting for a winter event dairy queen promotional event yeah well are they going to pull the winter event with the vanilla line like they did with the yeah mask line you can only catch em ask when it's spooky deerling and sauzbuck also not in the game because they haven't figured out seasons yet yeah yeah really they do weather they could i mean how hard maybe it is it that hard to say like only this pokemon spawns between january to march like i mean they can do it for community they can't imagine that it's gonna be that hard for my only uh uh yeah i guess my only thing is maybe they're trying to build actual season so they want more than just stealing which you would think that pokemon go would probably eventually want to get to but what other season pokemon are there yeah whatever you can make look i've watched the anime they can make it up as they go we'll see here we just thought you have vanilla ex spawn in winter and then you have yamas spawn and fall i don't know it seems pretty crazy see this stuff is only going to happen when they run out of pokemon and then there's like we've got to do artificial yeah scarcity so oh all of a sudden now out of the pokedex only these sets are going to appear at different times of the year so keep on playing kiddos here summon here summer form vanillite it's a puddle of water get it uh frillish and jealousy not in the games noted yeah these are weird these are weird things that happened included i don't yeah it's all the good ones it is really all the good ones yeah like they're like willisting are like the best pokemon from gen five dynamo electric and electrostats good ones good gracious you want to talk about some of will's favorite pokemons those little freaky electric flying lizard eel things heck yeah yeah they're pretty cool too drunk again not in the game yes skipped one oh yeah sorry uh main foo and main chow not in the games and drought again also not in the game dredging feels like it'd be a region specific what region uh uh scotland i don't know what region has dragons all regions have dragons middle earth i don't know where where are we it's in new zealand is what you're saying not new zealand no it's already as rally camp they don't need anymore does mexico have their own pokemon oh yeah they have course a lot they're fine yeah okay what is it based on where does it come from drone against a i don't know aren't all dragons european i've seen harry potter no no there's an entire series of chinese dragons is based on chinese dragons uh okay sure so they're saying on bobopedia the name also appears to show welsh influences so only appearing in wales where's wales is that connected to uh ireland no ireland is all ireland it is the south western section of the british isle the main the big one britain yes sure it's just below liverpool well it's like you got england in the middle we can't scotland on the top and whales in the lower left-hand corner yeah al is going to be typing furiously typing a giant paragraph in slack right now oh we don't understand scotland is the north england is the middle and wales is the phalange to the west but okay and this can be the last statement on the topic i think we can all agree that welsh is the coolest of the languages to come out of that particular island yes thank you i've had welsh grapes juice as well differently and the welsh's accent is terrible anybody who speaks welch's is just an abomination [Laughter] we have ponyard and bisharp not released i have zero possibility of why they're saving that pokemon uh when national chess championships come back it'll be a chess champion exclusive volabile and manda buzz are not in the game i i don't know stick it in nevada and call it a day new mexico nevada new mexico and arizona there you got your bases covered and the worst of the bunch larvesta and volcarona which is going to be like what are they going to they're going to do swab blue to this right they're gonna just make it spawn everywhere but a million candy yeah probably yeah oh man i'll do love me some vulcarona well get those 400 candies i you know i will oh because i also love larvesta you'll be walking around with that as your buddy for a long time i think uh already doing really good in the new competitive season well i mean congrats to that dude good job dude way to rise up in the ranks after the 16th popular band yeah i know it's like it's like it's like like all the like seconds here the jv pokemon are like we're finally getting our chance because the varsity team all got the flu [Laughter] we're gonna go get em and then you know caldeo mellowetta mythical legendary yeah all that stuff is gonna be like a concert exclusive somewhere like shakira releases meluda on her shakira world tour the breaking news here community note updates to mega evolution trainers the stuff pokemon go live by the way after listening to your feedback we have made the following changes to mega evolution number one mega energy required the mega energy requirement to mega evolution that has already mega evolved has decreased um what that means is it used to if you've all it costs 200 mega evolve that is the same once you have mega evolved it costs 50 again to mega evolve once again they decreased it to 40. second point the amount of mega energy that trainers are winning from raids have increased so i think the the most you could get before this was about 60. so you get anywhere between like 40 45 50 55 or 60 is what i saw depending on how fast you completed the raid and now it seems that you can get anywhere between like 50 to 90 i think what i remember so if you just got 70 so if you beat it in less than a minute and five i think it's 90 and then a minute and six is like 80 or something i don't have the numbers in front of me but spoiler none of this is gonna be relevant uh here are a few adjustments that we are working on walking with your buddy to earn mega energy more ways to earn energy through research tasks and other gameplay there are research tasks out there currently that do give you mega energy so there are more than one way to do it and then earning bonus candy when catching a pokemon that has the same type of mega evolve pokemon thank you for your feedback as we continue this update stay tuned we'll share more on this development process please be aware of your surroundings blah blah blah um so the the we're to circle back to the start of this conversation after listening to your feedback nothing was listened to let's be clear here oh no they listened they listened but they heard something right here yeah exactly so last week i i said and i i still stand by this i think if you're only filling your poke if you're only there to fill your pokedex you don't care about competitive in the game you just want to fill the decks not indorating not into go battling that kind of stuff i think the process of getting a mega evolution i think is fine it's a little tedious probably take you a week to get one four weeks to take the four plus you get the bonus b drill i think it's fine and then what most of the internet and i think us agree that mega evolution is not really implemented that well and the thing that i saw pop up is a lot of people are like we don't want to rent they're they're throwing away this throwing around this word rent pokemon the the general consensus here not and i don't know if i completely agree with it but i also feel like i don't have a horse in this race because i don't think mega evolution we talked about this last week i personally don't think mega evolution was a cool concept to really begin with um unless it's anime unless it's high level vgc stuff uh is you're wrong but continue they just want it to be free that's it right like it doesn't matter if they lowered the cost and give you more energy per raid they just want it to be free once they activate it the first time so by lowering by doing what they did in this message i don't think there's a there was a single person i found that was like now it's better right right and they said we're listening to your feedback and i believe they're not listening i believe they were looking at what is called the dollar signs of not a lot of people doing raids this last year and they were like what is a minor adjustment we can change that is feedback and sure that is feedback you know i we have the discord for people who watch on twitch and subscribe and we have the patreon we have the slack for people who subscribe that way multiple ways to give i'm trying to follow foot in niantic step multiple ways to give me money but both have been very very hard to find a mega raid in no one seems to want to do mega raids when they're posted in either of those channels um slack has you know close to 700 people discord has 1500 people yet heatran which is not a very good like no one actually likes heat ran but you know he ran it was it was very easy to get a heat rain raid and i think most people in both communities have gotten they're shiny at this point because it was a shiny yeah it was shiny you can get shiny charizard blastoise venusaur i mean i did but we we already have them like there's no extra incentive like this isn't the only time these have been shiny they have been shiny also we are getting a charizard community day in a month and a half like the incentive to do uh not like raids aren't fun and the mega evolution incentive clearly isn't there it's not it's not a game changer it's not super fun and it's temporary there's not a lot of incentive to do them like we're never going to get a heat trend community day until like 2050 when they're real desperate yeah i agree with you i i can't sit here and disagree with you you want to though i can hear it i can hear your voice i just i just don't think that giving in and and just being like okay you unlocked my evolution now it's free forever that is what people want right but that's clearly not what the pokemon company wanted right this was like the way they set this up was very designed to be something that you always work towards and if you want to mega you have to put the work to show it off and we have talked about how pokemon go is just showing things off at this point what should i do did you get did you get any higher bragging rights yeah the whole game is a grind yeah yes sure they could buy in they could make mega evolution free and you know you have to spend 500 mega candy to evolve for the first time instead of 200 but then it's permanent but then that mechanic is then done right there's an end goal to that mechanic and i think their thought process and i'm not saying their thought press is right is they they want they don't want to have end goals for trainers otherwise people want to be open-ended right they want people to keep playing their game so two thoughts first thought is mega evolution is still completely useless in the form of i understand why people don't want to join raids because there's nothing to really do with megas i was like you know what i'm gonna do it i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna champion i'm gonna i'm gonna champion my wallet i'm just gonna i'm gonna help people in the in either discord and slack coming up i'll pay the dollar i'll help them do their megas because there are people that like this right there are people that are okay with this they think the magazines is fun they have no problem spending a dollar here and there and so i got enough candy to mega evolve all of them i haven't mega evolved all of them but i mega evolved blastoise there's only one really i guess there's two things you can make of all blastoise against at this point one is heatran the other is charizard oh no no no no no step back you can mega evolved blastoise against anything you wish it's just whether you're getting any value from doing that first question so even with a mega evolved blastoise the game was smart enough not even to recommend it against charizard because it's not the best counter to charizard right ryperior is charizard's four times a week mega charizard wise four times a week to rock and only two times weak to water and mega charizard x isn't even weak to water because it's dragon and dragon resist water so if if we look at the raid bosses coming and i think we said this a lot all right i said this last week is we have chrysalia next pigeot venusaur charizard blastoise beedrill i guess maybe a drill is super effective against cresselia most of those pokemon are not super effective against crystalline then we have articuno and zapdos again pidgeot beedrill none of those pokemon are super effective against those pokemon either so what are we i maybe that part of the like i i don't think they overlooked they want us to grind forever that's very that's been very clear for the last four years yes the only mega that's probably gonna see a bunch of use is megastranatar because tyranitar is very good in most raids and like mega rayquaza because rayquaza is also very good in a lot of raids uh but i think that's kind of part of the problem now too even if there wasn't any other mega raids isn't i i must i think kyogre is still better than megablastoise in pretty much every situation if you're if you're just using water i don't know the thing that also happened in uh it just seems like it does in the main series games where it's like well i could mega evolve my blastoise but what if i just didn't hit that button and just hit hydro cannon and i was still able to knock it out yeah yeah uh the other thing part two of this is is i slack was was i wouldn't say heated they had their own thought process about mega evolution as well a lot of them being very unhappy with it a couple people saying that they didn't mind it and they liked it but so al brought up um that that he didn't like that it was raid only but from from this press release and from what we also said in the podcast is obviously that wasn't going to be always the case and i i brought up that like well shanks is technically raid only or was at one point right you could you could you can't find shanks in the wild uh i i guess you could find chinks and eggs but at the at at the time when they introduced shanks that was is pretty rare in in in eggs but al al did bring up a good point right like you could do one raid for a shanks and then you could never do another raid again and you could set it as your walking buddy and you could walk with it and it would take you a million years but the at the end of the day you could get a luxury which is i think the closest that like that kind of made me realize what the self rode and and the rest of the internet was talking about is like we want an end goal no matter what and as long as you're charging us candy to mega evolve again we will never feel like we've completed whatever we're searching for so yeah with shanks you could you could keep doing raids for it you could ignore raids altogether and hope that you hatch one and then at that point you could either use rare candy or you could walk with it forever to eventually get a luxury and there's really no way to do that with megas well i i guess there are there's two ways right now you could do rides for megas or you could hope to find the like three tasks out there in the world that give you mega rare mega candy which is only like five so are there any markers in the pokedex or anything like that that say hey this pokemon has been mega evolved there's a whole megadeth yeah oh then yeah then that that should be enough people you can show that to your friends i've never seen the word rented used as much as i have on the internet in the past a week i mean got our slash landlord you'll see it plenty exactly they're not wrong though like it's that's not a wrong analogy when i come it's least it's the same thing it's temporary right and it's that that horrible situation where it's like it's kind of like it's something that you bought but you still have to make a rental payment on it like i already paid full price for this and why do i have to do a monthly subscription just to be able to use it oh that's the territory we're getting into yep the the place i'm coming from is it's such like a weird hill to die on and i say that because i because again this this whole system is useless but i mean even even if it was free you wouldn't use these pokemon you would use different pokemon right now so you you always argue from the the point of the rational player and the majority of the folks out there are not rational players they're like i just want to use the one that i like the majority of the folks just use whatever the game suggests like hey you're going into this charizard and you have eight mega blastoise because it was like i don't know just let's pretend it was free you have eight megablast toys guess what it's not going to recommend mega blastoise because it's not the right choice i mean that's true that's a valid input as well but you could override that choice especially if it's your yeah but especially if you're walking yeah but no one does like like there's probably three people listening to that show that like mega beedrills their all-time favorite pokemon i'm sorry they're just better bug pokemon that are that just do way more damage and out of all the the things wrong with pokemon go and there's plenty of them this is like the weirdest hill for a lot of people to die on like to the point and i say that because like i just read threads of threads of comments of people being like this is the reason i'm leaving the game which is like most like that like the dumbest ultimatum ever but you know you know okay well one it's because it's new two because it's the the current thing to complain about that you're seeing it a lot three there's a lot of confirmation bias going on yeah right like there's a lot of there's a lot of complaints but this this is sure this is what people are mad about right now and this could be the last straw for a bunch of people who felt that everything was going micro transaction nickel dimey and this is just that next evolution that they can't stand anymore like it's not like this it's not like they're saying i was completely happy the entire life and i accepted every charge and now this this one is what's going to kill me no it's it's the you know it's the last straw it's the final paper cut it's what i was saying last time when you when you become very aware of the money-making scheme and the money-making grasp and that becomes sour because you could ignore it before but now you can't because it's so obvious that will ruin games for people that right yeah it's it is almost like a representation have you ever heard the expression like the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist yes right and it's the same thing right the greatest trick that these games can do is make you believe that they're not making any money off of you right and once visible to you that like oh wait they are actually are getting money off of me that sours it so much that you're like oh well but but my money would be better spent on carrot cake slices why am i spending my money on this digital entertainment that's actually not that entertaining i mean it's the same complaint you have for eggs you know when it's incubator egg events and it's just like well this is just a you know niantic needs a boost for the next research like when it becomes harder to ignore it becomes a bigger issue i want someone to create a diagram chart of the niantics fiscal quarters and event scheduling to see like when they need to pad those numbers to say oh we've got this much profit in q2 and it's like oh because you conveniently had an egg event during that time i think it's really easy to ignore megas like i i agreed i completely ignore them i play pokemon go by sending gifts that's it there's nothing in the game that would be like oh niantic is paying to win because we can't complete this without a mega pokemon like nothing needs this and i don't think nothing will need this yeah but that doesn't mean that when something new is announced and everybody's excited for it and everybody's looking into it thinking oh this is great and then you know hahaha the skin was peeled back and you're like oh yeah they can ignore it but it was the new thing that you were excited yeah to look at and now you're kind of confronted with oh and that's not easily ignored for a lot of people because yes i i'll do a raid every once while i don't care about it because i made my piece and i'm not going to give them a ton of money unless i really have to um and i don't do great things because i don't like paying my money but for people who had that illusion shattered that's not easy to come back from yes you can never do another mega thing before but you can't unsee what you saw yeah i also hate when people use the expression pay to win for pokemon go there is only one win in pokemon go and that's getting to level 40. you either are level 40 or i don't know your name you know my name william who are you excuse rude boy yeah i mean there's no pay to win in in the in the essence of everything outside go battling where go battling is pay to win because elite tms exists another two things what happens when these there's what 64 65 mega pokemon total not a lot uh what like what happens when charizard venus or blastoise go away they're not going to be in rates forever oh they're going to come up with some sort of generic mega yeah like like instead of rare candy there's going to be just generic mega candy which is not surprising here is this is what i need them to do find some way for me to be able to convert what is that that's clogging up my bag that i've got like a bajillion i've got like even more rare candies i got i gotta do how i do have a heck ton of rare candies fine give me a way to convert rare candies into mega evolution no no i just put the rare candy into like groudon and or zekrom or restaurant i don't think i have any of them okay good good start i do have what is it 600 and yeah 639 rare candy i have like 300. you can put them you can put the rare candy into a pokemon but not spend it on the pokemon so you could put like a hundred rare candy on mewtwo and then just now you have 100 youtube candy which is not clogging your space but you don't have to spend the mewtwo candy but i don't like i don't like touching the pokemon in pokemon go i like sending gifs and putting cute little stickers on them and then getting gifts and seeing where people have been that's my joy of pokemon go oh yeah stickers was the thing that people were finally gonna quit the game over but now it's megas interesting i like them stickers i like the meow stickers of stickers anyone who has ever complained about stickers on the internet in pokemon go has clearly been deprived in their life to have never gotten a postcard from a friend that has like four stickers on it like stickers are as useless as they are in pokemon go as they are in real life they're just fun that's all it is you just buy dumb stickers and you go i'm gonna send my friend a letter and then you put a sticker on it and you go well i guess it's better on this letter than it is sitting in a drawer and then you mail it and then your friend gets it and you go oh look at this dumb bulbasaur sticker that says bye that's cute all right this letter is going in the trash this it's like a one to one exact replica of how the real world and pokemon go overlaps maybe the only thing that overlaps look if there's anything i've learned about serious players of pokemon go it's that they do not enjoy fun and they don't like fun things so there's your disconnect what was i saying oh oh whoever knows they're going to keep releasing magnus obviously there's 60 some other measures they got to release i'm assuming at one point there's going to be some generic candy that they're just gonna be like raid this is a mega raid it will give you generic candy level up whatever manga you want the other question is if the pokemon company and niantic are not going to give in and make this free for people i'm sorry not free um one time use where is the compromise because no one was satisfied after this no one who was already upset became less upset after this press release although getting more candy from winning a raid is good for me because i was doing raids and i was like yeah this is fine i guess i'll make evolve this last way so i can take a picture of it i don't i don't know it sounds like a lot are we sure about that number what yeah no that's right i i i trust steve when he quotes those sorts of facts i'm looking it up how many are there 46. four no way are we talking like both charizards though both charizards both ladies then that goes up to at most 50. why are we talking are we are we including groudon in there wait why would you include groudon groudon doesn't make evil i know they probably evolve but yeah you gotta list it as are we talking ash greninja that's not a mega evolution look just because you are not talented enough to not need a mega stone because your bond between you and your pokemon are so good look i love them i love the nintendo 64. i feel like if you never know the number 64 is just a good number to throw out oh yeah how old are you 64. let's see how that goes for you steve okay what's what's the compromise then is the compromise like as long as it's your mega like do you think if they say as long as it's your walking buddy it's free to mega evolve do you think people would be okay with that but then you still have to like as long as it's your walking buddy and your walking buddies happy with you because my walking buddies never happy with me this this would be my solution oh here we go if you get to four star friends with your walking buddy it is permanently unlocked but i thought getting to force our friends wasn't that hard it's not hard it's just tedious it takes like as long it just takes like how many hearts go i think it takes like 64 hearts you can't stop throwing around 64 like it's a real number i'm gonna make 64 happen how many hearts to get max but it it takes it takes what like two weeks not two weeks sorry to like two months yeah something like that it takes a pretty long time how can i okay that's that's reasonable that's kind of like what i said last week of just like get do something where you have to do it enough times and then you get the mega stone and then you don't have to do it anymore and again besides seeing like people saying this is the reason i'm quitting the game or i i'm not i hate mega evolution this doesn't make it better the thing i saw over and over besides all of that was i don't care how long it takes as long as there's an end goal uh it took me 38 days to get my meowth to four stars it took me 50 days to get my vulpix the four star not stars four hearts it took me 123 days to get my bonsli to four no maybe yes man i spent a long time with that bonsai hatchet in dc it takes 300 hearts to be best buddies okay so the easy thing you can see 64. that's a big difference great buddies so 300 hearts um and if you just do the bare minimum a day which is feed it three times pet it take a picture that's three hearts so 100 days so three months if you're doing the bare minimum i'm assuming most people are probably doing a little bit more on commuting days or days where they play an hour or two that that would be my solution is make the great buddy thing a little bit better if you want free mega charizard x you just great buddy it and then because the whole i mean lore wise obviously mega evolution doesn't last forever but also lore wise is they karina what's her name karina she's like oh it's a bond between pokemon and their trainers everything's a bond between pokemon and your trainers that's the most useless advice but then if you hate the buddy thing and you don't want to use the buddy thing then you can do raids or you can do you can walk it uh or you could do the field research test like i think i think really more options is better like i don't want to specifically hatch eggs to get shanks because i hate hatching eggs i will just pay the dollar to the shanks i can visually see and just get it that way and then not catch it in that raid so you're to keep paying dollars until you do catch it i don't i yeah i mean it's clear to me that people don't like it because they're not joining my raids look i was asleep i had no idea that you had sent it so 48 mega pokemon total and then may and then primal groudon and kyogre will probably be the same process as megas let's take a break and we get back we got some tcg stuff and some master stuff to talk about so we will be right back garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage we are back pokemon trading card game there's just a lot of new products um coming up tcg first they're releasing v power tins you can add more powerful pokemon v yes they're still called v cards uh two year pokemon trading card game with the pokemon tcg v power tins there are three to choose from will you pick the gigantic crushing strength of eternities v the peerless courage of pikachu v no or the loyal heart of ev heck no ebv no i'm going with er eternalists [Music] which will you choose one of three foil cards five booster packs in each ten i'm going to tell you right now the teams are the tins are scam i don't think how many packs of hidden shadows hidden fates hidden fates hidden x and y hidden moon hidden fates is up to 18 dollars a booster pack if you can find it what for the charizard for the charizard for the chance of a charizard please open it up it will drop in price immediately speaking of tcgs and charizards um our my friend and yours aaron pulled a full art charizard v-max okay where does he get it raided nowhere because i wouldn't trust sending anything through the postal service right now okay if it in an ideal world where does he get it ready uh it doesn't matter too much uh becky beckett or psa um doesn't matter too much okay uh i think if if you can get beckett black i think that is the because black is more than a 10 or something like that but i think a beckett 10 is slightly worth more than a psa 10 but like by slightly i mean like maybe there's like a 10 difference some people there you go people specifically always you can use only want to get beckett i'm assuming it's like coke and pepsi some people only want psa some only want beckett but the becca people are we're more stuck up i don't know if that charger would go up or down i think in the long run it goes up because most stars go up in the long run but i think back in the day when i worked at shinders we had an in-house card raider yeah but that's that doesn't got name brand on it right that was just because we were willing to pay for it the the real problem with like beckett and psa is that if you live near it that's way better than mailing right because even even if there wasn't postal issues you still have to get that card insured so like let's say you pulled shiny charizard from hidden fates which at this point is i think selling if if it's like an eight or a nine i think it's selling for like eight hundred dollars and so not only do you have to like sleeve it and then top load it and then wrap it in bubble wrap and then like put it into like a concrete box and then like take it to the post office and they're like it's 30 to ship this piece of paper is do you want to insure it and you're like yes and they're like how much and you're like uh 80 hundred dollars and you're like oh well now now that's a hundred dollars worth of postal service insurance is like two dollars is it two dollars oh it's super postal insurance i don't know anyone who would like if i'm setting a 100 card to get graded to sell it and i don't get insurance on it like that's not on the postal service that's on you i just i've just heard a couple horror stories of people sending their shiny charizards over to beckett and it getting lost in the mail and they didn't get insurance that's like that's all on you value up to fifty dollars is the dollar sixty five fifty dollars in one cent to a hundred dollars is two dollars and five cents one hundred and one dollars to two hundred dollars is two dollars and forty five cents so get that insurance but it's cheap if you live next to a becket you could like that's the other problem too is even if the if the card was worth like 800 bucks easy easy choice mail it get the insurance call it a day but if you have a card that's worth like 20 and you just want to like grade it and you just want to keep it for your collection like how do you live next to a beckett like i know i've never heard of such a thing what are they that mean what because they're in like pennsylvan i think ps i think there's a psa in california and there's a psa in pennsylvania they have physical stores you can walk into i was not aware of that i thought it was a building with only one door and no windows no i'm pretty i am almost positive they're like a cart shop you can walk in and buy baseball cards or pokemon cards oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait grading and authentication store locator there are none near me yeah because they're like on the code there there's none i don't think there's any in the midwest would you look up beckett yeah power tins are out september 4th so they should be available i'm going to tell you right now they're not available at my target because ever since the pandemic started my target has not increased pokemon supply only decreased pokemon supply if there's a rep that is supposed to come in to refresh he ain't going to that target i'm going to there are a number of official places in chicago is there really yeah interesting according to their grading authentication stores and dealers chicagoland has like oh chicagoland i've heard of that place it's a bunch i've always wanted chicago in chicago there are six little indicators so check the web sites and you may have because there's one in st louis too apparently yeah but nobody's going to go i love st louis stop with your garbage talk i know we were supposed to go there this year will i i'm aware it didn't happen um according to this there are none on the coasts it's just there's thing is just showing me saint louis and chicago i think i think psa is on the coast oh well i mean they're not as good that's what i heard this is off pokemon.com eternitus v max premium collection also watching september 4th this will include one full art promo card of eternitus v one oil promo card of eternity's v max one collector's pin for featuring eternitis one oversized foil card featuring eternity's vmax one metallic coin six booster packs and a code card for online let me zoom in here let me see what's in this in this box enhanced i see two darkness ablazes i see a sword and shield i see uh cosmic eclipse which is still okay this looks like a burning shadows which is maybe okay it has the rainbow rare charizard 200 uh and this looks like a roaring skies i don't think it is a roaring skies but i'm going to say that first pack is garbo i'm not sure what it is though i don't think they're still stocking roaring skies the other tcg news the deck that everyone hates which involves using zashian and uh adp which is short for uh art arceus dialga and palkia the pokemon company decided to put that deck into a box and sell it to you for 25 bucks i'm into it they did this before with zekrom pikachu which was a very very popular deck i made a youtube video about if you want to get into the trading card game that is something you should buy because not only do you get the physical deck which you get a code card to get that entire deck into ptc geo the online client so and then they also had a restaurant and uh charizard deck which is as good i don't think as good as the pikachu zekrom but they are putting out another one in november the these are called league battle decks um it will feature zashi and v and arceus diagopalkia are they legal for competitive play 100 yep nice it will have uh a 60 card deck two pokemon v one tag team um so now ideally with with these decks the higher competitive level they're probably running like three v cards and three tag teams but they're giving you one although uh adp is not too expensive uh two acrylic marker condition markers one tag team marker six damage counter dice a competitive coin the rule book the code card the deck box it gives you all that 25 bucks it'll be available in november um i think the the actual news here is uh people were really really hoping for an adp ban because adp really limits the current meta it has limited the meta since it has arrived uh there's not a really a lot of good counters to adp besides adp uh and since they're putting out a league battle deck it doesn't seem like they're going to ban adp yeah they kind of did the opposite they're like yeah let's actually make it more popular they could i guess i mean they did put out a porygon distribution and then ban for it again that was a different branch of the company sir so maybe they just want to get their 25 dollars out of people and then before they banned them before they ban it yeah before the ban list when's when does it do to rotate out like oh adp8 rotating out to add next summer minimum uh because we just got we just got rotation and cosm adp is part of cosmic eclipse and cosmic eclipse was on the threshold of being legal for a whole another year wow and the next set coming out which is vivid voltage i think uh has a card that will make adp even better [Laughter] yay give me that money they could ban they have done emergency bans before it's pretty rare but what was it when will and i were playing there was an emergency ban and i don't remember what it was on me either it wasn't even like that popular oh it was on shiftery wasn't it i don't remember because shiftery had the ability where if you played it down the person would have you flip a coin and if heads they pick up their their active pokemon but if they only had an active pokemon they lost the game yeah that would do it i think that i i i might be misremembering it but that shiftery card was not great well i mean it was great when it worked for you when you were playing it it was good when you were again this is everything in pokemon tcg it's it's good if it's making you win right correct is that how you say shift tree shift tree now you and i say it right shift tree shift array what did i say it's two syllables not three shift tree shift you keep saying shiftery shiftery i'm pulling out the pokedex how do you spell the thing where's the audio shift shift shiftery shifterry i thought it was like there was like a shifting card thing i'm like i don't it took me away from you shiftery no no no no no as always if i'm wrong in the show i will admit i'm wrong shift3 is how we say it here we have to say cinderache so well you know correct greg i hear you love a mobile game called pokemon masters ugh love you're still playing it don't don't ever underestimate my ability to hate play anything wait before we proclaim that steve is partnered with dina i would like to officially announce uh i'm starting a crochet along uh and it is designed that everybody can do their portion of that week's portion of the crochet project while steve and greg talk about pokemon masters perfect and with will announcing that new segment i'm here to announce another new segment which is called uh gardenscapes corner [Laughter] talk about a game that really scams you that doesn't scam you at all yeah well the ads lie to you the ads are lying to you can you pay money in gardenscapes to disable ads or is it just the ads to get you to play gardens there are no ads in garbage okay the ads that exist out in the world that show you a false representation someday there will be a key pulling game that's like keep pulling logic puzzles someday it will come to fruition um i okay i will say this i'm mostly enjoying one year anniversary stuff we so so the dragon ball z orbs are not what aren't what levels yeah i cut that out last week's episode because we were wrong it's move candies which you aren't getting any of which is currently frustrating me they're very hard to get they are but they they they do give you at least an option once a week to get it it's just hard to get it yeah um the dragon balls lets you learn abilities the type abilities when you are on an all-type team they activate and do special things if somebody says they're not all grass team you get a boost somebody in slack said when i listen to the master segment i have no clue what you guys are talking about all right so you have dragon balls you have move candy you have tickets you got move coins coins i got paid and unpaid gems yes you got sync orbs uh skip tickets you got level up books you got soda i got i've got regular leaf and cigna suit correct there are two leafs you've got ultra buff blends uh you have the sink grid that you have to work yeah is there soda uh there's multiple sodas yeah the blue soda the the red soda the greens the support soda the strike soda pages and the training manual there are different levels of training right the silver book the gold book the platinum those are tomes i forgot about the toes there so there's tomes there are gym leader notes there are elite leader notes and there are training manuals okay let's let's not act for a second that the main series games doesn't have like 700 different garbage items that you'll never use we're just all used to it after 20 years use my sharp beak every day the game the the main series games if you click on it hey there's an area to click on it so you see what you have and b it will tell you what it does but yeah that's that's true there's there's a lot of things going on oh we didn't even we didn't even touch on the the weekly bingo uh okay yeah weekly bingo is garbo i mostly enjoy the year stuff um i am not over yet well over eggs i hate them okay well that's what i meant to talk about today pokemon masters ex grass fire water egg event is is happening now you have a chance to you hatch uh pokemon it sounds like this it's just that was just a regular charmander not signa suit charmander regular charmander uh this is running from september 2nd to september 16th you have an increase of earning eggs in battle you place these eggs inside incubators uh we'll be one of the starter pokemon they have a chance of being shiny i mean that's that's pretty much the deal eggs are completely opposite of pokemon go where uh they don't a hundred percent feel like you're getting scammed well i mean they're just not a heart event you can just ignore it all together what do you mean i mean if you don't like the egg events just don't do eggs yeah i mean i'm not i mean i get eggs like i do things in the game it's like hey you got a bunch of eggs and then they are clogging up my temporary storage so that i put them in there but like most of the point most of the thing is i i do ignore them but it is a piece of the game that i think why is this even here what is this doing for us not a lot i don't think there's a single egg pokemon that feels like it can compete at the level of a like a four star or a five yeah i maybe argue some of the eggs are definitely better than three stars i'm looking at you soul rock and lunatone i think they're for me they're just fun to collect i just really like being like i got the you know this is a two week long event and i got the two shinies during the event and i did it cool so that's what it is for me it's just a collecting thing sure it's just not i mean yeah it's not that interesting yeah i mean maybe one day the the egg pokemon will be slightly better i did um i did want to you know i ended up spending eighty dollars in pokemon masters yeah what uh and what how is your sigma suit leaf pulse uh i don't wanna talk about it oh yeah because you know i got two and i got two blues yeah and i know i i pulled two leafs they uh were they the uh were they the eevees that are so good yeah they uh oh yeah evie is the loving-hearted pokemon according to the last press release i read so the first thing that got me to spend money ever in masters and for the i like we i just talked about magazine pokemon go i'm i'm very comfortable with spending money and wasting money so the problem with that is when you say things like that i look at the amount of money i spend on twitch subscriptions and slack patreon memberships and i'm like that's my money you're wasting yeah yeah but i can tell you together after 52 raids will we we together got a shiny deoxis i don't have no shiny deoxys no i don't either i'll trade you one of my regular d-axis that i got along the way i i do have a partnership with dna they do give me a stipend every month so i do get a couple extra free gems so it's not my money okay but they're not paid gems remember there's a difference between the free and the pay so when dna and uh the pokemon masters rolled out the egg stuff you could add an extra incubator so you get one free incubator just like pokemon go but you could add an extra permanent incubator you know the pokemon go community has been renting incubators for four years now that i'm thinking about it anyways you can buy a permanent incubator for i think it was like three bucks right greg like 300 gems three bucks 350 gems is pretty annoying something like that yeah i refuse to do it because i don't give them money uh and then the other thing you could do is you could upgrade your storage so you normally could hold four eggs but now you could hold eight eggs and that was like it was like a 180 gems or like a dollar fifty or something like that so all together two permanent things for eggs was like less than six or seven dollars and they were both permanent and then normally during events they give you an extra incubator which i think so greg you have two now right because you have the and that was like the i'm looking at the incubator right now that one lasts for 10 days and then there's a third option because there's four slots for incubators and the third option is a it's 500 gems and it's a temporary incubator that will auto hatch for you and will last exactly two weeks from when you buy it and i was like egg event is two weeks this bulbasaur charmander squirtle thing is two weeks i have three incubators i had i bought gems i can afford this 500 500 500 gem extra incubator i was like let's just try it right because then i can at least talk about it and educate other whether this is worth it to people or not so not only does it give you the fourth and final incubator um it also lets you queue up eggs i think greg would probably remember this from like clash royale if you bought the five dollar a month subscription you could cue a chest up i don't know if you remember that at all yeah yep yep so for those that don't get it so let's say i put four eggs in and they like let's say it's you know it's 4 p.m i put four eggs in they last 12 hours that means they hatch at 4am well you know i'm not getting up until a reasonable person maybe gets up at 8 or 9 so they would be like oh you know those five hours of eggs not incubating what you can do is you can select four eggs in your inventory and you could say this is this is egg number one two three four and as soon as those eggs hatch in the middle of the night the four automatically go into your incubators and start incubating so you can hatch quicker um without always logging into the game is do i think that's worth 500 gems no no no i don't i don't no i think it's a little pricey i think if it was 500 gems for the month i would i think i would i could recommend it because then i'm just thinking like well you know if you play masters a lot five dollars a month for something that you like doing i think is reasonable that kind of leads me to believe that there are did we talk about this rumor that there was that when the mega evolution stuff was added to pokemon go that the data miners found that there was a baseline subscription service in pokemon go i think we might have mentioned that at some point there are two things in masters there's a uh there's the thing we talked about last week greg the gem bundle where like every day you log in you get the 50 and then there's the two week incubator um thing that you can buy and if we look at other nintendo games animal crossing fire emblem heroes uh mario kart they all have subscriptions and i i think i don't think anyone would be i don't think anyone on the show would be surprised if both pokemon go and masters has a subscription eventually and whether and i think specifically with masters it would be the egg thing and it would probably be the gem thing they were merged together into one would be my guess i don't know what it would be for pokemon go uh i don't either like i mean you could get incubators in pokemon go yeah that's true yeah that's true uh yeah the pokemon go could have it where you know if you pay 10 a month you get a second permanent incubator as long as you pay that money i think literally every hardcore fan would probably do that and also remember that they can take stuff away so they could start a subscription service and then make pokestops less generous or gifts less generous or start a subscription service and say you get bonus items from the pokestops which please don't well that was number one i wouldn't need that because my bag is always full that was well that's the thing with the gem bundle in um masters is when you get it not only do you get gems by logging in every day but you also get like bonus sync orbs and sync herbs are pretty sought after right now great do you play any gotcha games that have subscription services um does drag algae lost have one no no it doesn't nope they're still gems but they're i i've never seen one i can't think of a one that i've made it playing them that long where they've switched over to a subscription service pokemon dude yeah but i didn't play that that long yeah but like two months before they just killed the game yeah um i feel like subscription services and mobile games like the last ditch effort say that it's saved clash royale you don't think say it though well shout out to jyn uh oh so we we had a pkmn cast clash royale guild clan whatever it was called it was like me greg logan was in it yeah we had a lot of people but then a lot of people right and then over time you know people stopped playing clash royale you could have a max of 50. and at one point we were just full we couldn't accept any new people yeah so i would i would end up kicking people who haven't played in like two or three weeks so we could get more people in at a certain point then we couldn't get full we were just at like 40 always which is like fine we had like 40 people and then the thing i think that killed it for a lot of players ironically everyone in this guild were pokemon players was uh just this really tiny indie game called sword and shield came out yep and that was the last time i really played clash royale i would play clash royale a little bit at work but ultimately what killed it is when i had to start working from home other games that are just better it was fun to do it was fun to jump in and do like a quick two minute battle and clash royale on my work break but now that i can go downstairs somewhere break and do raids and sword shield or anything else it was just like this game isn't that fun and i think ultimately i dropped it because it wasn't that fun it was just a time filler and once that spell was broken i was like well i'm out i you know i don't need i don't want to play this anymore it's just not an interesting game and they started doing weird subscription things and season passes yeah i thought they're five dollars a month for what they were offering i thought it was good it was okay oh my gosh well you got uh you got the chest queuing you got chest cueing and you sometimes got interesting tower designs a lot of the towers items were bad yeah so ultimately i was like why am i spending money on this uh but yeah pokemon duel switched to a subscription like two months before they closed uh and their subscription was not good at all and i think it was like 14 a month and when you did it you got like a shiny celebi and then they were like you can pull any five star that you're missing and uh it wasn't particularly great oh but oh my sorry so sword and shield came out and i was like and then clash royale yelled at me and they were like you're the leader of this clan if you don't log in it's gonna go to somebody else and i was like well this isn't fair to the people in the clan right i'm going to you know i'm going to give it to jyn in our slack been a supporter of a long time shout out and then jyn will be leader jin can make the decision if people need to leave or come or go uh and all that stuff because they were number one in our client anyways too they're very very good at the game and clash royale just released a brand new huge overhaul update running ads for it i saw it on instagram and i was like ah you know what i got a little down time i can't fall asleep let's check out some clash royale installed the update go into the game and i i almost wanted to like cry because the thing that i went into was like 30 messages of people leaving the clan and then it was all of like the top players in our clan like saying goodbye to each other they're like ah thank you so much for the memories it was really fun to battle with you oh great job jen really appreciate what you did here hey i'm gonna go to an active clan but i loved you guys it was just all these like really nice messages and then i like look and the only like two people left in the clan are like me and greg who haven't logged in and like i was like i can't play this game because we need a clan and there's no clown anymore i deleted it off my phone is that my final goodbye after you texted me that i'm like oh well i'm out delete shout out to everyone who played clash royale with us you know in retrospect we you know in retrospect we were talking about like harry potter coming out and whether or not pokemon go players will move to harry potter it's it's it's so interesting that people will stick with the game just because their friends are playing the game yeah and as soon as you have no one playing that game like even if i really wanted to play clash royale i don't i can't i'd have to like try to get people to join and it's put it's just a lot of work yeah it's a lot of work for not a lot of fun so that should become a clash royale streamer and then yes that's true uh so egg event is happening right now we do not know when the family event is starting sometime before the end of september right they said september so i thought it was the 14th or something so that would be lucine gladion and lily assuming number 64 that's when it's coming out ah the 64th of september yeah assuming that lucy loves um lily is the one lily and clefairy was already shown in the trailer however long ago so that's happening right now for masters i don't think anyone's complaining about stanimal right now no because you're getting a lot yeah they're giving you a whole lot uh i also noticed and then once it dries up everybody complaining about it again uh i also noticed the current egg event is only 10 instead of 20. yeah which is what it should be oh yeah across the board well the last thing i want to talk about before we go to question of the week is um sensory tower which reports on app revenue money i'm not 100 sure how they get it but is this a weird website sensory sensory they always we've talked about them before they always do like app data stuff not including pokemon go on this chart but these are all the other pokemon games on mobile magikarp jump in the first year of spending we thought in 2020 we'd be talking about magikarp jump uh made five million dollars pokemon that's impressive pokemon quest liquor yeah yeah magikarp temples wait magikarp you had to make choices they were random choices but sure uh it does say this revenue does not include revenue from third party android stores so i think if those from google play are good i don't know can you even get these games in third party inter android stores sure apparently maybe pokemon quest made 10 million dollars in its first year pretty good pokemon shuffle made 11 million dollars pokemon duel made 14 million dollars and finally pokemon masters at 75 million dollars which is a lot more than the other ones and what's not on there pokemon go which is weird because they've reported on pokemon go stuff before so i'm not sure why they couldn't do it for this data that i'm not sure of yeah it's just like a weird well i we don't need the pokemon go data we know that pokemon goes number one yeah but like billions and billions it's good to put it in perspective yes like how much did they make their first year it wasn't it like 207 million yeah i think it was like at least 200 million so it's leaving that out is semi-important like okay there was another pokemon go that was vastly vastly vastly more popular than masters is yeah and does double did double the money masters did in the first year like that is kind of important context it's not saying that pokemon masters isn't doing well but like it's just weird that they would leave that out when they're gonna go with magikarp jump again everybody knows nobody played what what i played magikarp jumping they gotta ever pay for anything on it i did i did the five dollar welcome bundle magikarp jump i don't think was ever designed to like i don't i think if any if there was any innocent game in the history of true i agree magikarp jump was very very innocent and the main reason i gave it five dollars was just because i was genuinely having a good time with it and i was like well i want the developers to see something and apparently they saw enough because we know the people who are making magikarp jump people who made magikarp jump are making pokemon sleep uh this is this is the interesting conversation is you have a game like pokemon duel which they desperately tried to save multiple times they reworked the mechanics they cleaned up the menus they they changed a lot of it to the point where they're like we launched a 14 a month subscription service that was completely garbage that clearly no one signed up for and then they shut down and it made in total 14 million dollars in its first year and i think a game that is pretty well loved and a game that people won't shut up about for sequels is pokemon quest till this day people are still like where's the gen 2 of pokemon quest i mean 10 million dollars is a lot of money i mean also keep in mind that gamefreak who made pokemon quests they also sold 14 million copies of black and white and they made 10 million dollars with pokemon quest i don't know if there would ever be a sequel to quest i mean there could be could be sure they need the time in the interest to do it i don't think i don't think gen 2 i don't think adding 100 pokemon requests in some more levels makes quest any more interesting though i think quest was a good short fun game and and honestly it works for the first set of pokemon right coming having spoiler having mewtwo be the final thing that you battle kind of like makes sense but yeah there's not really any what how can you celebrate in do something equivalent that's a celebi thing celebi's not mad mewtwo is always mad yeah mitchu's got anger issues always has always will i mean unjustifiably so pokemon shuffle at that 11 million though pokemon travel was a good game pokemon shuffle was a good game pokemon shuffle two yeah i mean they just gotta rip off what gardenscapes is doing and we'll be back how about pokemon uh pull the key where's that game no no no no no no no no i'm putting my foot down right on that direct pikachu's lightning through this key system question of the week i love the questions i love the queries of the question of the week yeah sounds like a show tune all right this one is from kevin from our slack says have you learned any real world facts and knowledge because of pokemon yeah i have one i'll go last though because it's embarrassing no now you have to go first facts because of pokemon i i learned that um delicious uh onigiri rice balls are called donuts in japan oh boy i mean i learned a lot about um forget how what it's called there's this particular plant that is poisonous uh that disguises itself as that looks like roses which is where the masquerade of rose raid came from i have to remember what it's called but anyways that whole the whole like design and how it was based off of an entire uh series of poisonous flowers um and they are very similar to roses is basically the design concept behind rosarite which is really super it was like an interesting thing to learn about flowers because i didn't know all that stuff so i mean there's a bunch of like weird what is this based off of stuff that i've learned like yeah yeah that's i think that's where i get a lot of it as well like the is it azural that's that changes gender because that's based off of the frog that does or the fish that does like there's all those little weird flags that are super cool that i'm like yeah what's your one steve go go go okay i'm gonna i i'm confident in my ability as both a podcaster and an uneducated person to blow somebody's mind here the hop-up line no no back away from the edge no i can take it i can tell all right so it's a hop hoppip skip loom i mean i know where this is jump fluff right so number one is it's hop skip jump hop it skip loom jump fluff number two is it's the entire evolution of a dandelion and i didn't know until somebody pointed this out that the yellow dandelion is the same as the white fluffy dandelion and i didn't know they were the same plant until that i did not know that that's where this was going and you have blown my mind the weed and then skip looms the yellow dandelion and then jump fluff is the fluffy dandelion but i didn't know the fluffy one was a dandelion until like two years ago i thought you're thinking it was a different place okay okay okay i'm going to give you i i'm going to ask a question that's going to help shed light how obsessive was your family about your lawn we didn't have a lawn okay yeah we didn't really have a lawn we took care of but wait didn't you ever pick one up and like blow yeah yeah totally yeah did you think you were blowing out well flat an old weed a flower i don't know the puff flower the puff flowers right flowers you don't learn dandelions or weeds until you're like six you just think they're flowers when you're looking for look look look look weed is a human term okay a plant is a plant just because you don't like it doesn't make it a bad thing friend i will give you this i only knew that because when growing up with fairly large yards uh you would watch them change right like i don't think of a time when i was taught in school the life cycle of a dandelion i could see if you never had them in your yard or a yard to watch them change over no no no but like i i know at times in my life do you want to blow on the dandelion right it's just like because you name the thing that you pick from the ground and blow on all right could i can i can i wha what is th what is the word i want like save this this moment in time can i can i i can try i had an additional fact about hop it skip loose skip bloom jump off that is is a real world fact that some people may not know oh here we go that hop skip and jump the triple jump is an olympic sport did you know that yeah skip jump is an olympic sport the triple jump triple jump oh no well now now you do it's been a heck of a show [Laughter] okay okay okay okay okay answer a question all right did you or anybody around you ever name the white puff plant at all that you can remember not that i not that i can remember no okay was we're we're unreally elementary school kids did they ever pick one up just just blow seeds in your face did that ever happen so yeah i mean like if if we're going through my traumatic childhood i mean we like i my elementary school was like all cement like we didn't have like a grass area we could play in it was just a huge cement probably used to be a parking lot so you needed to grow up in hawaii and then they put like some basketball hoops that didn't really have hoops i don't you know what i'm talking about they didn't have nets yeah they didn't have nets okay didn't have nets like it was just a board without a hoop yes you don't have dandelions in hawaii yeah they do oh do they now no yeah oh we're get wrecked dandelions are everywhere man yeah maybe that was part of the problem and i didn't i didn't have like i mean i had school friends as a kid but my parents were like oh you you you're not allowed to leave the house i'm very strict i was very sheltered as a kid oh that's okay that's okay we are we are expanding your horizons as your um adopted uncles because i'm definitely not gonna be your dad look it's fair pokemon of the week all right so last week's pokemon um so the one thing that i was not straightforward about but i did describe that was possibly a key to figuring out the solution in north america i'm not gonna hold mexico and canada accountable i i will say it's probably just us in the united states but potentially in canada as well we are the only part of the world where vultures and buzzards are considered to be the same bird in the rest of the world buzzards and hawks are considered to be the same bird which if you've ever seen a vulture and you've ever seen a huak you know that they look nothing like this [Laughter] like what is wrong there but for some reason the word buzzard when it got over here got applied to two vultures um and i mean you had if you wanted to look up right the king gizzard and the lizard wizard and find out their nonagon infinity album and the fourth what was it the fourth song is like person vulture or people vultures so that would have given you that hint uh and then the last part was about the part of your mouth that holds your teeth which is confusing because birds don't have teeth but the top and bottom of their beak are actually called by the word mandible so you
