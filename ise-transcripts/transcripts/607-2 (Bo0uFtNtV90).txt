more voices of women in the Pokémon (1:04 - 1:10)
community on for this special episode (1:07 - 1:11)
we're going to be here talking about our (1:10 - 1:14)
experiences with Pokemon what got us (1:11 - 1:16)
into Pokemon in the first place and how (1:14 - 1:18)
it's a part of all of our (1:16 - 1:22)
lives and with that we can kind of just (1:18 - 1:24)
have this conversation so (1:22 - 1:27)
hi (1:24 - 1:31)
hello um I always like starting with (1:27 - 1:34)
where it began for each of us so I do (1:31 - 1:36)
really want to just sort of ask how each (1:34 - 1:38)
of you got into Pokemon and what your (1:36 - 1:41)
first memory of Pokemon is and whether (1:38 - 1:45)
that kind of ties in that kind of (1:41 - 1:45)
thing yeah so I I can start with that um (1:45 - 1:53)
my first Pokemon game was a Pokemon (1:49 - 1:56)
Silver um so I started with Gen 2 my (1:53 - 1:59)
first starter was syndic Quil um didn't (1:56 - 2:02)
really get into it at first I didn't get (1:59 - 2:05)
like um like video games at first um and (2:02 - 2:09)
then uh silver and Crystal I had both um (2:05 - 2:10)
and then I really hit my stride with uh (2:09 - 2:13)
Generation 3 Sapphire is still like my (2:10 - 2:16)
favorite main Series game but I played a (2:13 - 2:21)
lot of silver and Crystal and um loved I (2:16 - 2:23)
I love all three of the Johto starters I (2:21 - 2:26)
think they're really fun um I think that (2:23 - 2:28)
it's unfortunate that like they're never (2:26 - 2:30)
really viable and competitive because (2:28 - 2:33)
they don't have like dual typings but (2:30 - 2:34)
for alligator just got buffed in in (2:33 - 2:38)
Pokemon go so that's nice um and we do (2:34 - 2:43)
have huan we have huan tyion so syil has (2:38 - 2:46)
that Evolution now yeah and we might get (2:43 - 2:49)
new ones in uh plza like very exciting (2:46 - 2:52)
but um but yeah and then on the like (2:49 - 2:55)
card side I remember um I had an older (2:52 - 2:58)
cousin who gave me a drowsy card when I (2:55 - 3:01)
was very young I was probably four or (2:58 - 3:04)
five and I was just like this is so cool (3:01 - 3:06)
like Pokemon is just so cool and then (3:04 - 3:09)
you know um like a lot of people like (3:06 - 3:12)
took a break um in like adolescence and (3:09 - 3:15)
then uh came back with Pokemon go and (3:12 - 3:20)
haven't looked back uh 2016 to today (3:15 - 3:22)
um it's become a huge part of my life (3:20 - 3:25)
for anyone watching who knows me already (3:22 - 3:28)
uh Pokémon go is like the predominant uh (3:25 - 3:31)
space that I'm like present in and (3:28 - 3:33)
active in um but I'm all throughout the (3:31 - 3:35)
franchise at this point and and really (3:33 - 3:38)
love everything about Pokemon (3:35 - 3:42)
so just a huge huge part of of my entire (3:38 - 3:45)
life but all all starts with you know (3:42 - 3:48)
one Pokeball on a screen or or one card (3:45 - 3:50)
and it's really beautiful yep was that (3:48 - 3:52)
was The Drowsy card before or after you (3:50 - 3:56)
were playing the games it was after so (3:52 - 3:58)
games for me came first and then and (3:56 - 4:02)
then the uh trading card game nice yeah (3:58 - 4:05)
I think for me it was similar except (4:02 - 4:08)
swapped my very first memory of like (4:05 - 4:10)
getting a Pokemon was my first Pokemon (4:08 - 4:13)
card which was a horsey Pokemon card and (4:10 - 4:15)
then very shortly after that I started (4:13 - 4:17)
playing the games and really haven't (4:15 - 4:22)
looked back since um and then aen what (4:17 - 4:24)
about you I think your story is a little (4:22 - 4:27)
different it is a little different um so (4:24 - 4:29)
I actually started with the anime I (4:27 - 4:31)
remember remember watching the anime (4:29 - 4:32)
growing up and my parents getting me (4:31 - 4:35)
like the VHS tapes as well to watch them (4:32 - 4:38)
at home and whatnot um I also just liked (4:35 - 4:39)
all like the plushies and everything (4:38 - 4:41)
that I came across and I remember some (4:39 - 4:44)
of like the fast food toys and stuff and (4:41 - 4:45)
being into (4:44 - 4:48)
those um and then I think after that I (4:45 - 4:50)
got into like the trading card a little (4:48 - 4:52)
bit because I remember I had people that (4:50 - 4:55)
lived across the street from me from my (4:52 - 4:56)
parents house they were going to throw (4:55 - 4:58)
out a bunch of Pokémon cards and I was (4:56 - 5:00)
like no I like Pokémon I I you know I (4:58 - 5:03)
know the anime and that stuff so I like (5:00 - 5:05)
picked up essentially their garbage (5:03 - 5:07)
which I'm very happy that I did because (5:05 - 5:10)
I still have those cards to this day um (5:07 - 5:11)
and like and they were actually being (5:10 - 5:14)
thrown away not like at a garage sale (5:11 - 5:14)
yeah they were just going to throw it (5:14 - 5:16)
out and I'm like no don't throw that out (5:14 - 5:20)
don't waste so I took them and there's (5:16 - 5:22)
some really cool like old cards in there (5:20 - 5:24)
I can't remember like any super specific (5:22 - 5:25)
ones off the top of my head but I do (5:24 - 5:27)
remember I even got like some like (5:25 - 5:28)
German (5:27 - 5:31)
cards in the set and like some Japanese (5:28 - 5:34)
cards and stuff um (5:31 - 5:38)
so sorry cat things um but then after (5:34 - 5:39)
that after getting like the trading (5:38 - 5:41)
cards (5:39 - 5:44)
I got into I think the video games at (5:41 - 5:46)
that point and my first game that I (5:44 - 5:49)
played was leaf green I want to say and (5:46 - 5:53)
then I went directly into Pearl after (5:49 - 5:55)
that and that was like the biggest time (5:53 - 5:58)
snc so I'm like definitely nostalgic for (5:55 - 6:01)
Gen 4 which is (5:58 - 6:03)
debatable whether it's good but I (6:01 - 6:06)
definitely have Nostalgia for it it's (6:03 - 6:08)
completely fine to like a generation (6:06 - 6:12)
even if even if the Remake wasn't great (6:08 - 6:14)
it's such a it yeah I don't I have (6:12 - 6:16)
feelings about that (6:14 - 6:19)
but um yeah so I would say like Gen 4 is (6:16 - 6:20)
like definitely the biggest generation (6:19 - 6:22)
for me in regards to the games and then (6:20 - 6:25)
I remember I played through a little bit (6:22 - 6:26)
or a good chunk through black and white (6:25 - 6:28)
for whatever reason didn't finish it I (6:26 - 6:30)
think because then at that point I was (6:28 - 6:33)
getting into high school and like you (6:30 - 6:34)
all chatted about last year on the (6:33 - 6:36)
podcast where you kind of like hit that (6:34 - 6:39)
age where it's no longer cool you know (6:36 - 6:41)
to like Pokemon I kind of fell off and (6:39 - 6:43)
into college from there fell off was (6:41 - 6:46)
kind of keeping up with the news um and (6:43 - 6:47)
then I (6:46 - 6:50)
remember I don't know what triggered me (6:47 - 6:52)
to want to look up a Pokemon podcast but (6:50 - 6:54)
I was like I want to listen to a Pokemon (6:52 - 6:58)
podcast stumbled across this one ISC uh (6:54 - 6:59)
a little bit before like sword and (6:58 - 7:03)
Shield came out I want to say and then (6:59 - 7:06)
that just like skyrocketed like Mo the (7:03 - 7:08)
most I've ever seen even more than I was (7:06 - 7:10)
a kid loving Pokemon uh now and then (7:08 - 7:14)
I've been loving Pokemon ever (7:10 - 7:18)
since I guess long story short (7:14 - 7:21)
shortish I mean one of the really cool (7:18 - 7:23)
things about Pokemon is that because (7:21 - 7:24)
it's been around for so long we can all (7:23 - 7:28)
have long stories of kind of it being (7:24 - 7:30)
part of our lives (7:28 - 7:33)
but I mean it sounds like all of us are (7:30 - 7:35)
super into I mean I know we're all super (7:33 - 7:37)
into it right now and we've all (7:35 - 7:40)
experienced kind of finding community (7:37 - 7:43)
Through Pokemon I know that I found (7:40 - 7:45)
Community also kind of through this (7:43 - 7:48)
podcast and through ISC but I've also (7:45 - 7:50)
found community Through (7:48 - 7:54)
Pokemon honestly just playing Pokemon go (7:50 - 7:57)

Through Pokemon because of Pokemon go uh (7:57 - 8:03)

another question we're we're talking (11:06 - 11:10)
about community and finding community in (11:08 - 11:12)
Pokemon because that's something I know (11:10 - 11:15)
all of us has done have (11:12 - 11:18)

that definitely going to NAIC and going (11:18 - 11:26)
to go Fest um those were fantastic (11:22 - 11:28)
experiences that I knew I was going to (11:26 - 11:30)
enjoy but didn't realize I was going to (11:28 - 11:32)
enjoy as much as I did and through those (11:30 - 11:36)
experiences I've made even more great (11:32 - 11:38)
friends through all of that that I'm (11:36 - 11:40)
like really really grateful for and just (11:38 - 11:44)
make me just genuinely so so so happy (11:40 - 11:45)
like I feel like because of Pokemon (11:44 - 11:46)
being in my life and meeting the people (11:45 - 11:49)
that I've met through the Pokemon (11:46 - 11:51)
communities um and everything I feel (11:49 - 11:54)
like these are the most these are the (11:51 - 11:55)
relationships that I've had with people (11:54 - 11:58)
that have may be the happiest I think (11:55 - 11:59)
thus far in my life which I'm really (11:58 - 12:00)
grateful (11:59 - 12:03)
for yep I I think I've had that (12:00 - 12:05)
experience (12:03 - 12:08)
too uh yeah some somewhat like topically (12:05 - 12:11)
to the episode like some of the most (12:08 - 12:13)
incredible uh communities and (12:11 - 12:15)
experiences that I found through Pokemon (12:13 - 12:20)
is like I'm an admin for an uh a women's (12:15 - 12:23)
Pokemon go PVP group so like cool yeah (12:20 - 12:26)
we have girls at PVP um for Pokémon go (12:23 - 12:30)
I'm also a member of a haini series (12:26 - 12:33)
um in VGC and then there's a group girl (12:30 - 12:37)
power TCG with the training card game (12:33 - 12:40)
and it's remarkable as someone who's (12:37 - 12:42)
been in like Competitive Gaming for (12:40 - 12:45)
years not just in the Pokemon scene but (12:42 - 12:48)
all over to see these congregations of (12:45 - 12:50)
like-minded women who compete in these (12:48 - 12:52)
you know pillars of Pokemon I think (12:50 - 12:54)
there's one that exists in unite as well (12:52 - 12:55)
and my apologies to the unite players (12:54 - 12:59)
I'm not exactly sure of the the name um (12:55 - 13:04)
but it's just amazing to see like all (12:59 - 13:05)
over the world like there's other admins (13:04 - 13:08)
for girls at PBP that live in Australia (13:05 - 13:11)
that live in Europe like that I might (13:08 - 13:15)
never get to meet in person but I know (13:11 - 13:18)
as familiar as you know people that live (13:15 - 13:21)
in my city and I'm friends with just (13:18 - 13:24)
from this you know common common (13:21 - 13:28)
interest of Pokemon MH yeah yeah I I (13:24 - 13:30)
definitely will say it is like I never (13:28 - 13:32)
heard of anything that you just listed (13:30 - 13:34)
off to be completely honest but I (13:32 - 13:37)
absolutely adore that that is seems to (13:34 - 13:38)
be like a growing community and (13:37 - 13:41)
everything um because I think I mean I (13:38 - 13:43)
briefly spoked about it when we made (13:41 - 13:45)
like the little group chat and uh I (13:43 - 13:46)
think I've spoken about this with I've (13:45 - 13:48)
spoken about it with a number of people (13:46 - 13:51)
but I love to see that that Community is (13:48 - 13:54)
growing for women especially because (13:51 - 13:57)
like I've yes I've only been to NAIC (13:54 - 13:58)
once and I've watched like a good (13:57 - 14:00)
handful of of like the competitive (13:58 - 14:02)
streams and everything in Pokemon but I (14:00 - 14:03)
it it is (14:02 - 14:08)
primarily um men I identifying men that (14:03 - 14:12)
are competing so it is awesome to see (14:08 - 14:15)
more identities I guess competing um and (14:12 - 14:16)
getting in or rather getting into the (14:15 - 14:18)
competitive scene I really really love (14:16 - 14:21)
to see that just having that diversity I (14:18 - 14:25)
guess yeah yeah I mean I will say I have (14:21 - 14:26)
heard of all of those things I'm just (14:25 - 14:29)
not in them because I'm not a very good (14:26 - 14:31)
VP (14:29 - 14:31)
ER I will say that's not a requirement I (14:32 - 14:36)
don't think for any of them that's a (14:34 - 14:40)
requirement um but no I understand yeah (14:36 - 14:43)
I I love that they exist I've been to a (14:40 - 14:46)
few different uh in-person tournaments (14:43 - 14:52)
regionals I've been to one worlds so far (14:46 - 14:55)
and yeah the the gender balance in the (14:52 - 14:56)
events (14:55 - 14:59)
is nowhere near 5050 but it has (14:56 - 15:02)
definitely gotten much closer I think my (14:59 - 15:06)
first regionals was back in (15:02 - 15:10)
20 I want to say 2016 maybe (15:06 - 15:12)
2017 and there was maybe one woman (15:10 - 15:16)
competing for every 20 (15:12 - 15:21)
men that was that was an (15:16 - 15:24)
experien I can only imagine I know that (15:21 - 15:26)
that makes a lot of people (15:24 - 15:28)
uncomfortable not everyone but I know it (15:26 - 15:30)
does make a lot people uncomfortable so (15:28 - 15:32)
I'm really glad that there are groups (15:30 - 15:35)
that allow people to have more community (15:32 - 15:37)
at these events at these (15:35 - 15:39)
competitions and that is one of the (15:37 - 15:41)
reasons I wanted to have you on here (15:39 - 15:42)
today because I know that you can (15:41 - 15:45)
represent some of those (15:42 - 15:48)
communities yeah yeah no (15:45 - 15:51)
I I definitely uh can relate and (15:48 - 15:53)
understand and like it's it's striking (15:51 - 15:56)
to me a lot at times that Pokemon like (15:53 - 15:59)
this franchise that is so (15:56 - 16:03)
for everyone like it is it is so um (15:59 - 16:07)
inclusion focused it is you know not (16:03 - 16:09)
this kind of franchise that might (16:07 - 16:12)
inherently you know turn away women um (16:09 - 16:14)
based on like the content or anything (16:12 - 16:16)
like the The Source material is for (16:14 - 16:18)
everyone and that's like that's that's (16:16 - 16:22)
Pokemon um that it still you know gets (16:18 - 16:25)
these kinds (16:22 - 16:29)
of lack of inclusion just from and and (16:25 - 16:31)
not that it's anything that is being (16:29 - 16:34)
forced artificially it's just so many (16:31 - 16:37)
men involved so so little spaces for (16:34 - 16:40)
women and that's like one of the most (16:37 - 16:41)
powerful things that I can do and (16:40 - 16:43)
something that I'm most proud of is like (16:41 - 16:45)
being involved in these groups and (16:43 - 16:48)
having a space that even if it's not (16:45 - 16:51)
based on the exclusion of them in (16:48 - 16:53)
particular but rather that a woman can (16:51 - 16:55)
ask a question without someone (16:53 - 16:59)
responding oh you don't know this or um (16:55 - 17:02)
without feeling like being judged (16:59 - 17:04)
because anyone can ask anything and (17:02 - 17:06)
we're going to have that same experience (17:04 - 17:08)
of being talked down to or we're going (17:06 - 17:10)
to have that same experience of um you (17:08 - 17:13)
know whatever treatment it is at event (17:10 - 17:17)
or um you know just out playing the game (17:13 - 17:20)
that you know you have someone there (17:17 - 17:23)
that has been in those two um it's it's (17:20 - 17:27)
really really um empowering and and it's (17:23 - 17:30)
it's something I'm always so happy to (17:27 - 17:32)
see someone else get involved see (17:30 - 17:36)
someone else get that spark ignited by U (17:32 - 17:37)
having that (17:36 - 17:43)
space yeah absolutely I mean it's that's (17:37 - 17:45)
fantastic yeah it's just like genuinely (17:43 - 17:48)
so lovely to hear that yeah and to be (17:45 - 17:53)
part of creating those spaces for people (17:48 - 17:57)
definitely um we kind of speed ran first (17:53 - 17:59)
memories of Pokemon and the Pokemon P's (17:57 - 18:02)
not cool period but I did want to kind (17:59 - 18:04)
of talk a little bit more about what it (18:02 - 18:06)
was like coming back to Pokemon after (18:04 - 18:08)
since I know you both said you both did (18:06 - 18:11)
have kind of that period that most (18:08 - 18:14)
people go through of thinking Pokemon (18:11 - 18:16)
isn't cool or Pokemon is just for kids (18:14 - 18:18)
and Pokemon's may be not a part of my (18:16 - 18:21)
life anymore but clearly we're all very (18:18 - 18:24)
in it right (18:21 - 18:24)
now so what was it like coming back to (18:24 - 18:29)
Pokemon after those Peri perod I know (18:27 - 18:34)
for me I had that kind of a little bit (18:29 - 18:36)
but only for like a year because I was (18:34 - 18:39)
too busy with school stuff so I never (18:36 - 18:41)
fully stepped away from Pokemon myself (18:39 - 18:43)
but it sounds like both of you maybe did (18:41 - 18:44)
a little bit (18:43 - 18:47)
more so what was it like coming back to (18:44 - 18:49)
Pokemon I think Anna you said you came (18:47 - 18:54)
back when Pokemon go hit yeah so I yeah (18:49 - 18:57)
I petered out around the like Generation (18:54 - 19:01)
4 so I um I still to this day have not (18:57 - 19:03)
played Generations 5 six and seven and I (19:01 - 19:06)
really want to play um Generation 6 now (19:03 - 19:08)
before the (19:06 - 19:11)
uh yeah (19:08 - 19:14)
exactly um so there were like two kind (19:11 - 19:17)
of thoughts to jumping back into Pokemon (19:14 - 19:22)
go is like one um this is so cool like (19:17 - 19:24)
how the game has and the franchise has (19:22 - 19:27)
like adapted to current day current day (19:24 - 19:32)
being 2016 at the time so8 years ago um (19:27 - 19:36)
but um seeing that and then wow there (19:32 - 19:38)
are so many more Pokemon and like (19:36 - 19:39)
learning all this (19:38 - 19:42)
obviously uh generation six had come out (19:39 - 19:44)
so there's an entire new typing at that (19:42 - 19:48)
point in time um and relearning (19:44 - 19:51)
everything so there were like two stages (19:48 - 19:55)
to this one is Pokemon go comes out um I (19:51 - 19:56)
continue with Pokémon go for about a (19:55 - 19:58)
year and a half and then I took like a (19:56 - 20:01)
year and a half off um the game was kind (19:58 - 20:03)
of stagnant at launch I think a lot of (20:01 - 20:06)
people recognize that of you catch the (20:03 - 20:07)
original (20:06 - 20:09)
151 um except not even that CU (20:07 - 20:13)
legendaries weren't in at launch so um (20:09 - 20:15)
and especially (20:13 - 20:17)
also um I was still in college when it (20:15 - 20:20)
released and then like moving back to (20:17 - 20:22)
the suburbs like not as qu not as much (20:20 - 20:26)
to do um and then I got and then I got (20:22 - 20:29)
back into it and raids had been released (20:26 - 20:33)
and PVP had been released um and I said (20:29 - 20:34)
okay if I'm getting back into this game (20:33 - 20:37)
I'm going to get back into it (20:34 - 20:40)
seriously and learned all about all the (20:37 - 20:41)
new Pokemon learned all about the (20:40 - 20:44)
typings um because type interactions had (20:41 - 20:46)
changed as well obviously with with (20:44 - 20:49)
fairy being released um I also think (20:46 - 20:50)
like some stuff around like steal and (20:49 - 20:52)
dark and ghost like I have it all (20:50 - 20:54)
memorized now but I think like there was (20:52 - 20:55)
a period of time where they were like (20:54 - 20:57)
Metagross is too strong Nerf Nerf steel (20:55 - 20:59)
typ anyway (20:57 - 21:02)
um in between like G three or four or (20:59 - 21:04)
something like that (21:02 - 21:07)
um Dove head first into it know all the (21:04 - 21:10)
Pokemon now again and but it was just so (21:07 - 21:12)
much it was so much and it was great it (21:10 - 21:15)
was like I am very much someone um who (21:12 - 21:17)
will hyperfixate and very much someone (21:15 - 21:20)
who will like oh are there resources for (21:17 - 21:23)
this I will dive head first into them um (21:20 - 21:25)
and I also like to them like create (21:23 - 21:28)
resources for it so like very early on I (21:25 - 21:29)
was like (21:28 - 21:30)
oh here are these interesting things (21:29 - 21:31)
about (21:30 - 21:35)
PVP um let me be able to share this (21:31 - 21:37)
information um which has always been (21:35 - 21:39)
great as well like (21:37 - 21:41)
uh having it be this like living (21:39 - 21:44)
breathing community of I can learn from (21:41 - 21:47)
you and you can learn from me and we can (21:44 - 21:51)
you know tackle this experience together (21:47 - 21:54)
just super cool yeah and you really dove (21:51 - 21:56)
into it you're not just someone who I (21:54 - 21:59)
mean I'm not trying to rank one of these (21:56 - 22:00)
as more or lesser than the other but (21:59 - 22:02)
you're not just someone who helps (22:00 - 22:03)
organize these great communities for (22:02 - 22:06)
women in PvP communities but you're also (22:03 - 22:09)
someone who has found a lot of success (22:06 - 22:11)
in competitive (22:09 - 22:15)
Pokemon yeah right yeah I um I mean I (22:11 - 22:17)
have my wall behind me of like I'm very (22:15 - 22:19)
impressed I'm very impressed honestly (22:17 - 22:22)
yeah my top eight playmats my my world's (22:19 - 22:24)
competitor playmat back there behind (22:22 - 22:29)
Cubone um I've I've written articles for (22:24 - 22:32)
pokemon.com like it's it's always an (22:29 - 22:35)
incredible honor to be able to um be (22:32 - 22:37)
involved in competition at the highest (22:35 - 22:43)
level to be recognized as such um and (22:37 - 22:45)
it a blessing that I I never take for (22:43 - 22:47)
granted like the success I found in (22:45 - 22:50)
Pokemon at both on a like again like (22:47 - 22:53)
competitive level but on a on a social (22:50 - 22:55)
level like being looked up to being (22:53 - 22:56)
asked to be part of things like this (22:55 - 22:59)
like this was an honor to be um request (22:56 - 23:02)
for this this podcast annah um (22:59 - 23:05)
and it's it's something that I I really (23:02 - 23:10)
appreciate all the time I um I know that (23:05 - 23:15)
um it's not as easy for women (23:10 - 23:19)
in content in competitive in whatever it (23:15 - 23:21)
may be um because we're not given those (23:19 - 23:24)
opportunities as much A lot of the times (23:21 - 23:28)
and it's something that I'm always just (23:24 - 23:31)
so glad for so glad that I can help move (23:28 - 23:33)
that needle that I can you know do (23:31 - 23:37)
whatever um it is to help me and others (23:33 - 23:39)
and that's been beautiful as well is (23:37 - 23:41)
like getting other women involved in (23:39 - 23:44)
creating content helping coach other (23:41 - 23:48)
women to do well at events um and just (23:44 - 23:49)
you know be the change you want to see (23:48 - 23:53)
it's that's so nice I love (23:49 - 23:59)
that can I ask what um are like what (23:53 - 24:01)
have what competitions have you done the (23:59 - 24:05)
best in do you have a like yeah a way to (24:01 - 24:08)
talk about that yeah of course of course (24:05 - 24:10)
so I've competed in all three games at (24:08 - 24:11)
this point just goes where I found the (24:10 - 24:13)
most success um but I competed in the (24:11 - 24:16)
trading card game at Charlotte this year (24:13 - 24:19)
um and I've in the video game a few (24:16 - 24:21)
times probably five different regionals (24:19 - 24:24)
um between this year and last year um (24:21 - 24:27)
but in go yeah I've Top Cut five (24:24 - 24:29)
different like Regional tournaments I've (24:27 - 24:32)
won a lot of local tournaments um not (24:29 - 24:34)
that winning a local tournament isn't a (24:32 - 24:37)
big deal just comparatively um (24:34 - 24:41)
so uh first one was actually in London (24:37 - 24:43)
2022 um there was a last chance (24:41 - 24:45)
qualifier for the World Championships (24:43 - 24:49)
which was in size and scope the same as (24:45 - 24:52)
a regional it was 128 competitors um and (24:49 - 24:55)
I came in fifth I tied for fifth there (24:52 - 24:58)
um which did not allow me to to compete (24:55 - 25:00)
in Worlds but was a really really nice (24:58 - 25:05)
finf um my second top eight is the (25:00 - 25:07)
anamoros right there um and that was (25:05 - 25:09)
Poria 2023 and that's probably the (25:07 - 25:11)
regional I'm most well known for um I (25:09 - 25:15)
was a finalist and um myself and the (25:11 - 25:19)
grand champion um Aiden um really good (25:15 - 25:23)
young player uh wound up playing 15 (25:19 - 25:25)
battles which um for anyone who doesn't (25:23 - 25:27)
follow the circuit you have normally (25:25 - 25:31)
best of during like the uh tournament (25:27 - 25:33)
and then the winners finals losers (25:31 - 25:35)
finals and Grand finals are all best of (25:33 - 25:38)
five so we played out five games in the (25:35 - 25:42)
Winner's finals I won to enter on the (25:38 - 25:44)
Winner's side in Grand finals he went (25:42 - 25:46)
down to lowers finals (25:44 - 25:50)
won and then we went to five games in (25:46 - 25:51)
the first set and he wound up winning (25:50 - 25:53)
and then five games in the second set (25:51 - 25:56)
and he wound up winning um but it was (25:53 - 26:00)
like one of the closest (25:56 - 26:03)
matches that um even even like to this (26:00 - 26:05)
day um people like come up to me and (26:03 - 26:08)
talk about fur uh (26:05 - 26:12)
2022 2023 season but October of (26:08 - 26:14)
2022 um and it was just remarkable and (26:12 - 26:17)
that's what really kind of put my name (26:14 - 26:19)
on the map as a competitor for people (26:17 - 26:21)
who didn't follow like Grassroots (26:19 - 26:25)
circuits for anything like that and then (26:21 - 26:28)
Portland um actually after (26:25 - 26:31)
um Poria I staffed a regional so that (26:28 - 26:33)
was really interesting uh seeing that (26:31 - 26:36)
side of things in Arlington That season (26:33 - 26:38)
and then Portland (26:36 - 26:40)
um which again Hannah you were (26:38 - 26:43)
mentioning um that was my return after I (26:40 - 26:45)
did a few events in VGC because last (26:43 - 26:48)
year if you made uh the finals of a go (26:45 - 26:50)
tournament you qualified for worlds (26:48 - 26:52)
automatically so I took a break tried (26:50 - 26:53)
out some other things returned for (26:52 - 26:57)
Portland um tied for fifth again there (26:53 - 27:01)
got my karate on playmat and then um (26:57 - 27:05)
probably the finish I am that would be (27:01 - 27:07)
like considered the most competitive (27:05 - 27:09)
would be NAIC last year and I don't (27:07 - 27:11)
think you all can see that but that's (27:09 - 27:13)
behind me is the competitor playmat (27:11 - 27:15)
which my ring lights are completely (27:13 - 27:17)
getting a glare in but next to it is the (27:15 - 27:21)
top eight so I finished in fifth at um (27:17 - 27:22)
the North American International (27:21 - 27:24)
championships which is probably the (27:22 - 27:27)
toughest um other than World competition (27:24 - 27:31)
that I've competed in and that was a (27:27 - 27:33)
very sentimental run I played against a (27:31 - 27:36)
lot of friends in the bracket leading up (27:33 - 27:39)
to um getting into top eight I was (27:36 - 27:41)
really really hoping that I could get (27:39 - 27:44)
the playmat because I love EV luins I (27:41 - 27:47)
mean very classic like very popular with (27:44 - 27:49)
women uh they're they're they're so (27:47 - 27:51)
great I'm wearing an Evolution shirt so (27:49 - 27:54)
I get it yeah I love that I notic that (27:51 - 27:59)
very good um and (27:54 - 28:01)
the final match that I played so like my (27:59 - 28:03)
like signature Pokemon is (28:01 - 28:08)
tapini um like one of the only people (28:03 - 28:09)
like every every top eight that I've (28:08 - 28:13)
done I've used papini um outside of the (28:09 - 28:17)
lcq so since since Peoria onward every (28:13 - 28:20)
top eight um and almost every tournament (28:17 - 28:25)
I use uh the Pokemon and so the final um (28:20 - 28:28)
game that I played um was like a playoff (28:25 - 28:30)
afterwards so I I made top six and then (28:28 - 28:32)
there's a playoff for a travel award (28:30 - 28:33)
because it because of how it cascaded (28:32 - 28:36)
down um with people who had already earn (28:33 - 28:37)
a travel (28:36 - 28:40)
award and I played against um another (28:37 - 28:42)
very strong competitor in the (28:40 - 28:44)
scene (28:42 - 28:48)
um and in the game three decisive game (28:44 - 28:52)
three of a best of three um I get topini (28:48 - 28:56)
against his uh meta Cham he still has uh (28:52 - 28:58)
two Shields remaining so Pokemon go you (28:56 - 29:01)
get two fields to use uh to just block (28:58 - 29:04)
moves and um in Pokemon go surf is like (29:01 - 29:08)
a relatively um cheap energy charge (29:04 - 29:11)
attack moonblast is a much more (29:08 - 29:13)
expensive this is hard to explain like (29:11 - 29:16)
outside of context of knowing go PVP but (29:13 - 29:19)
like I guess you can compare that in uh (29:16 - 29:23)
in um the C trading card game as well (29:19 - 29:24)
you have to use energy for mooves but (29:23 - 29:27)
like moonblast was a very risky move to (29:24 - 29:28)
throw given the fact that he had two (29:27 - 29:31)
Shields remaining and I went for it and (29:28 - 29:32)
he didn't Shield it and it went through (29:31 - 29:35)
and it basically like there was still (29:32 - 29:37)
play to be done in the game but the game (29:35 - 29:39)
was over at that point and um there's a (29:37 - 29:44)
very unflattering um GIF of me like (29:39 - 29:47)
screaming uh after after that landed (29:44 - 29:49)
because it was just like the most (29:47 - 29:52)
amazing thing um I I love it it's it's (29:49 - 29:53)
it's very unflattering but it's very (29:52 - 29:56)
like passionate I'm sure it's flattering (29:53 - 29:57)
because like you said it's passionate (29:56 - 29:59)
it's full of all the emotions so in (29:57 - 30:00)
that's in that sense it's flattering but (29:59 - 30:02)
I get it (30:00 - 30:06)
exactly um yeah and then worlds in Japan (30:02 - 30:10)
was amazing um being competitor there um (30:06 - 30:13)
I went I think two and two maybe three (30:10 - 30:16)
and two I don't remember um like nothing (30:13 - 30:19)
crazy but I built my team strictly (30:16 - 30:21)
around having fun and that's what I did (30:19 - 30:24)
um to me like it is I want to be a (30:21 - 30:26)
competitor at Worlds I want to obviously (30:24 - 30:28)
um hold my own (30:26 - 30:30)
but I'm not aiming to be number one I'm (30:28 - 30:33)
aiming to be the best like in helping (30:30 - 30:35)
people get into the scene in being that (30:33 - 30:39)
representation I can be um not to like (30:35 - 30:41)
say that I didn't try it worlds I (30:39 - 30:44)
absolutely enjoyed it but um it was a (30:41 - 30:46)
wonderful time and like super super (30:44 - 30:48)
great to be there and then right after I (30:46 - 30:51)
I um the first Regional this season was (30:48 - 30:53)
in (30:51 - 30:58)
Pittsburgh and um made Top Cut there but (30:53 - 31:01)
not not nearly as uh like famous as the (30:58 - 31:06)
niic run or the Poria run um and then I (31:01 - 31:07)
I really haven't been competing much (31:06 - 31:10)
this season there's been um some (31:07 - 31:11)
personal stuff there's been some (31:10 - 31:14)
Community stuff that hasn't been amazing (31:11 - 31:16)
but (31:14 - 31:19)
um I am planning on competing you know (31:16 - 31:21)
at Worlds this season I'm most of the (31:19 - 31:23)
way there Pittsburg helped a lot um with (31:21 - 31:27)
the point system and um I always still (31:23 - 31:30)
like you know love the game and uh might (31:27 - 31:32)
compete more next season depending on (31:30 - 31:35)
how things you know play out and it's (31:32 - 31:37)
just super great and and those you know (31:35 - 31:40)
really good memories are always always (31:37 - 31:43)
amazing yeah that's awesome to hear we (31:40 - 31:47)
don't usually have people who are super (31:43 - 31:50)
competitive on here um and I'm (31:47 - 31:53)
definitely not so it's fantastic to just (31:50 - 31:55)
sort of hear the firsthand (31:53 - 31:58)
experience yeah it's it's super super (31:55 - 32:00)
super fun it's really interesting to me (31:58 - 32:02)
cuz I don't consider myself a (32:00 - 32:05)
competitive person but I love the game (32:02 - 32:08)
and I'm really good at it and it's like (32:05 - 32:09)
and even that's like difficult for me to (32:08 - 32:11)
say like people will be like stop (32:09 - 32:14)
selling your heal short and I'm like (32:11 - 32:16)
well I feel like it's so simple because (32:14 - 32:18)
it gets to the point where it's like (32:16 - 32:21)
second secondhand nature um especially (32:18 - 32:25)
with Pokémon go yeah um and it's it's (32:21 - 32:27)
still wild like again I was helping a (32:25 - 32:30)
friend of mine scrimmage for again like (32:27 - 32:31)
I haven't competed much this season but (32:30 - 32:33)
I'm still helping other people build (32:31 - 32:36)
their teams of six you know uh scrim for (32:33 - 32:40)
tournaments whatever it may be and um (32:36 - 32:41)
like he goes on to like win the (32:40 - 32:43)
tournament and I'm like oh like I was (32:41 - 32:45)
just holding my own against him okay if (32:43 - 32:48)
I you know if and when I I kind of make (32:45 - 32:51)
a return to competing in these um (32:48 - 32:54)
outside the local level like I'll still (32:51 - 32:56)
be (32:54 - 32:58)
fine (32:56 - 33:01)
yeah I will say I remember being in like (32:58 - 33:05)
the general crowd at niic and I I know I (33:01 - 33:06)
already like briefly mentioned this but (33:05 - 33:10)
I remember I was watching either unite (33:06 - 33:11)
or the (33:10 - 33:15)
VGC and I didn't ever work my way over (33:11 - 33:17)
to the Pokemon go Section because I like (33:15 - 33:20)
the PVP and Pokemon go is like there's (33:17 - 33:21)
already a lot of things that go over my (33:20 - 33:22)
head when it comes to competitive (33:21 - 33:24)
Pokemon Pokémon go is like the most (33:22 - 33:28)
foreign thing to me I have no idea PA it (33:24 - 33:32)
is it's most comparable to poen but like (33:28 - 33:34)
poen um just because it's like a (33:32 - 33:37)
fighting game level of like speed um but (33:34 - 33:38)
even poen like I feel like has a lot (33:37 - 33:41)
more context for a new player compared (33:38 - 33:45)
to like go like if you I I I understand (33:41 - 33:48)
completely but um yeah I remember (33:45 - 33:51)
sitting in that crowd and not even being (33:48 - 33:53)
in the Pokémon go Section but hearing (33:51 - 33:56)
about you specifically in Pokémon go and (33:53 - 33:58)
like how you were killing it and I'm (33:56 - 33:59)
like I have no idea who this person is I (33:58 - 34:01)
have no idea what's happening over there (33:59 - 34:02)
but as far as I know she's the only (34:01 - 34:04)
woman I've heard of and seen over there (34:02 - 34:06)
and I'm so happy to hear that it's so (34:04 - 34:10)
cool you go so like I wasn't even in the (34:06 - 34:12)
section but I was hearing about you and (34:10 - 34:13)
I was like that is so (34:12 - 34:18)
cool that's that's so great I I really (34:13 - 34:20)
appreciate that that's of course what (34:18 - 34:23)
it's all about you know mhm yep yeah (34:20 - 34:24)
it's really cool definitely really cool (34:23 - 34:25)
to (34:24 - 34:28)
hear and with that I want to turn this (34:25 - 34:31)
over to you Ace and ask you more about (34:28 - 34:34)
your experiences in Pokemon after coming (34:31 - 34:36)
back from your Pokemon isn't really cool (34:34 - 34:38)
but wait is (34:36 - 34:42)
it yeah little break in there um yeah so (34:38 - 34:44)
I guess like I said with high school (34:42 - 34:47)
that's when I fell off uh around then (34:44 - 34:49)
and then going into college especially (34:47 - 34:52)
but I definitely still liked Pokémon I (34:49 - 34:55)
just didn't talk about it I think I had (34:52 - 34:58)
like some Pokemon plushes laying around (34:55 - 35:00)
um I'm just like looking around my desk (34:58 - 35:01)
to see like if anything if I have (35:00 - 35:02)
anything on my desk that carried over (35:01 - 35:04)
but I probably had like some Pokemon (35:02 - 35:05)
plushes I knew the Pokemon cards are (35:04 - 35:07)
there I kept them safe because I was (35:05 - 35:10)
like I know I still love them but I'm (35:07 - 35:12)
just not playing and I know I still had (35:10 - 35:15)
like a i i i at that time even though I (35:12 - 35:17)
fell off I had like a Nostalgia for Gen (35:15 - 35:19)
4 still and I was like oh it' be nice to (35:17 - 35:21)
you know play the Pokemon games and (35:19 - 35:22)
hearing about the ones that were coming (35:21 - 35:26)
out um I was like oh I kind of want to (35:22 - 35:28)
play it but I just once I was in college (35:26 - 35:32)
it was more so it became a time thing (35:28 - 35:34)
because at that point while I was in (35:32 - 35:35)
once I made it to college and made it (35:34 - 35:36)
past like the first year and everything (35:35 - 35:38)
I kind of found my own identity and I (35:36 - 35:40)
was like oh if I got to back into (35:38 - 35:41)
Pokemon that would be awesome I don't (35:40 - 35:44)
care about being quote unquote cool in (35:41 - 35:46)
high school going into college you're (35:44 - 35:47)
finding your identity I finally found (35:46 - 35:49)
that and I was like yeah I love Pokemon (35:47 - 35:52)
but at that point I was Far deep into (35:49 - 35:54)
college and I was like now I don't have (35:52 - 35:57)
the time to get back into Pokémon um um (35:54 - 36:00)
but I still knew I loved Pokémon and I (35:57 - 36:02)
remember when Pokémon go came out that (36:00 - 36:04)
was like a that was like a surge at one (36:02 - 36:06)
point when I got back into it I think (36:04 - 36:08)
everyone did even if you didn't know (36:06 - 36:10)
Pokemon you were playing Pokemon go so (36:08 - 36:12)
uh that was definitely a surge and I (36:10 - 36:13)
think I just kind of fell off again (36:12 - 36:16)
because time time was a big thing for me (36:13 - 36:18)
school was just College in general was (36:16 - 36:21)
just very stressful so there was that (36:18 - 36:24)
and I think um I think I was still in (36:21 - 36:27)
college when sword and shield was coming (36:24 - 36:30)
out and I was like getting to a point (36:27 - 36:32)
where I can kind of manage my time a (36:30 - 36:35)
little bit better and I heard a little (36:32 - 36:36)
bit about like sword and shield coming (36:35 - 36:39)
out and then I guess I just you know (36:36 - 36:40)
picked up the podcast and then just (36:39 - 36:41)
started listening to the podcast weekly (36:40 - 36:43)
and being like oh this is really cool (36:41 - 36:46)
and then after like maybe like five (36:43 - 36:48)
weeks of listening to the weekly podcast (36:46 - 36:50)
I like was like you know what I'll do (36:48 - 36:52)
the patreon I'll I'll you (36:50 - 36:55)
know join the patreon and pay for (36:52 - 36:57)
something that I'm really enjoying like (36:55 - 37:00)
and then uh getting involved in the (36:57 - 37:01)
slack as much as I (37:00 - 37:05)
could was I think what really like (37:01 - 37:08)
kickstarted everything and because like (37:05 - 37:10)
the the slot Community was just so so so (37:08 - 37:12)
welcoming and lovely and I felt like a (37:10 - 37:14)
sense of community and be like okay I (37:12 - 37:18)
can dive into this now um and then from (37:14 - 37:20)
there it was just playing sword and (37:18 - 37:23)
shield learning re learning about all (37:20 - 37:26)
the new Pokemon and everything um (37:23 - 37:29)
because like you Anna I also did not I I (37:26 - 37:31)
started Gen 5 never finished it didn't (37:29 - 37:35)
play Gen 6 didn't play gen 7 um so (37:31 - 37:36)
skipped all of that I heard about it but (37:35 - 37:38)
just skipped all of it (37:36 - 37:41)
completely actually funny enough too I (37:38 - 37:45)
never even played until recently gen two (37:41 - 37:49)
or gen 3 so I also skipped Generations (37:45 - 37:51)
when I was a kid I just wasn't like in (37:49 - 37:53)
the games as much as I was in the the (37:51 - 37:56)
anime and the TCG so I have like a whole (37:53 - 37:58)
gap of knowledge (37:56 - 38:00)
that I like I've been piecing yeah I've (37:58 - 38:02)
been piecing it together over the years (38:00 - 38:03)
ever since essentially like sworded (38:02 - 38:06)
Shield where I am like kind of just a (38:03 - 38:08)
sponge and just taking in all of the (38:06 - 38:11)
knowledge at this point and very happily (38:08 - 38:14)
happily taking in all the knowledge from (38:11 - 38:18)
um the internet and the community and (38:14 - 38:22)
everything but yeah it was I that's I (38:18 - 38:25)
think that's pretty much a good a good (38:22 - 38:27)
summary you're more than just in the (38:25 - 38:30)
slack you you do all the Pokemon things (38:27 - 38:34)
too yeah yeah yeah I do like obviously (38:30 - 38:37)
getting into uh streaming and everything (38:34 - 38:40)
and all of that as well uh I've only (38:37 - 38:42)
been diving more into Pokemon and kind (38:40 - 38:44)
of making my own I guess little (38:42 - 38:46)
Community as well it started off as just (38:44 - 38:48)
like making a community with like my IRL (38:46 - 38:50)
friends and bringing in like friends (38:48 - 38:53)
from high school friends from college uh (38:50 - 38:55)
other friends that I kind of just knew (38:53 - 38:57)
from internet communities and just being (38:55 - 38:59)
like I just want to talk about Pokémon (38:57 - 39:01)
but y'all are all in like three or four (38:59 - 39:03)
different spaces can I just put you all (39:01 - 39:04)
in one (39:03 - 39:07)
space then the then the Discord server (39:04 - 39:09)
was born and then it just kind of like (39:07 - 39:12)
went from there I guess which of the (39:09 - 39:15)
games have you been like which specific (39:12 - 39:16)
games have you work been working on (39:15 - 39:18)
playing to kind of fill in the gaps in (39:16 - 39:21)
the game based (39:18 - 39:23)
knowledge I guess currently I'm playing (39:21 - 39:27)
through Crystal MH to kind of see what (39:23 - 39:29)
what the hype of Gen 2 has been like is (39:27 - 39:31)
all about and so far I'm really liking (39:29 - 39:34)
it definitely really liking it um and (39:31 - 39:36)
then obviously just kind of taking it as (39:34 - 39:38)
much knowledge as I can about the (39:36 - 39:39)
Pokemon themselves from scarlet and (39:38 - 39:41)
violet and what I remember from sword (39:39 - 39:44)
and shield to just apply it to what I (39:41 - 39:46)
know about the generation that it came (39:44 - 39:50)
from uh there is that as well but yeah (39:46 - 39:52)
at the moment mainly just playing (39:50 - 39:54)
through Crystal just to see like why do (39:52 - 39:56)
people say crystal or Gen 2 is their (39:54 - 39:59)
favorite gen and then eventually working (39:56 - 40:00)
my way into gen 3 and be like why do (39:59 - 40:01)
people say this is their favorite (40:00 - 40:05)
generation and then skipping right past (40:01 - 40:07)
uh Diamond and Pearl because I'd never (40:05 - 40:12)
want to play those slow games (40:07 - 40:14)
again ever ever want to play those games (40:12 - 40:16)
again I don't even want to play (40:14 - 40:17)
brilliant I don't even want to play the (40:16 - 40:19)
new ones I don't I don't want nothing to (40:17 - 40:20)
do with it I'm going straight to (40:19 - 40:23)
platinum I'm not doing not happening I I (40:20 - 40:24)
was going to say when you said playing (40:23 - 40:26)
through Crystal I'm like well you've (40:24 - 40:28)
played through gen four a lot so like (40:26 - 40:31)
goo also struggles with level curve um (40:28 - 40:33)
quite a bit I think two and four are (40:31 - 40:36)
like the biggest um you know problems (40:33 - 40:38)
with that and I was like well you'll (40:36 - 40:40)
have you'll know what you're getting (40:38 - 40:42)
into when when you get to that point in (40:40 - 40:45)
in Joo well so far it's been it's been (40:42 - 40:48)
okay with Crystal at least because I do (40:45 - 40:50)
have the epilog operator so I just like (40:48 - 40:52)
pop my cartridge in it and when a game (40:50 - 40:54)
when the game becomes like too grindy I (40:52 - 40:57)
just speed it up and I could just run (40:54 - 40:59)
around in the Grass at like two times (40:57 - 41:01)
double speed like bolting through the (40:59 - 41:04)
grass to like grind out and level up my (41:01 - 41:06)
Pokémon so it hasn't been like that bad (41:04 - 41:09)
it hasn't felt as like slow as Diamond (41:06 - 41:13)
and Pearl have felt yeah thankfully so (41:09 - 41:14)
I've been I've been having a great time (41:13 - 41:17)
with Crystal awesome and I see the (41:14 - 41:19)
appeal I definitely see the (41:17 - 41:21)
appeal (41:19 - 41:25)
nice okay I think unless either of you (41:21 - 41:27)
have interesting discussion questions (41:25 - 41:29)
you want to ask of any of (41:27 - 41:33)
us I can move into the more rapid fire (41:29 - 41:36)
stuff for the rest of the episode I'll (41:33 - 41:39)
think about it along the way sounds good (41:36 - 41:40)
I don't have to be the only one asking (41:39 - 41:43)
questions here so I just going to do (41:40 - 41:46)
some of the more typical questions that (41:43 - 41:48)
you ask when you're getting to know a (41:46 - 41:52)
Pokemon fan so and I I'll I'll answer (41:48 - 41:57)
them too my answers all come with the (41:52 - 42:00)
kind of uh stumbling around not making (41:57 - 42:03)
good solid decisions because none of I (42:00 - 42:04)
I'm bad at making decisions about (42:03 - 42:09)
favorite decisiveness yeah same same but (42:04 - 42:11)
if you had to choose one that's that's (42:09 - 42:14)
kind of what this is so if you had to (42:11 - 42:16)
choose one favorite Pokemon what would (42:14 - 42:18)
your favorite Pokemon (42:16 - 42:22)
be Eevee (42:18 - 42:22)
Don sandrew (42:22 - 42:27)
doneand I love (42:25 - 42:30)
sand sandre Far and Away my favorite (42:27 - 42:34)
canonian or alolan both uh cantonian is (42:30 - 42:37)
my original favorite um but I'm I'm huge (42:34 - 42:40)
into I I love armadillos in general and (42:37 - 42:44)
and pangolins both like um little Little (42:40 - 42:48)
Critters um and yeah I I don't have the (42:44 - 42:50)
plush out I have Cubone out I love (42:48 - 42:52)
ground types in general but um have all (42:50 - 42:55)
my like sand mer this a little stamp pin (42:52 - 42:59)
that's so cute very cute um yeah so like (42:55 - 43:02)
I've always loved s through cantonian (42:59 - 43:04)
form um (43:02 - 43:08)
and I was back into the franchise when (43:04 - 43:10)
uh gen 7 was being like teased and (43:08 - 43:15)
started and I feel very blessed that I (43:10 - 43:17)
love the regional form of my favorite (43:15 - 43:20)
Pokemon because I'm sure again I think (43:17 - 43:22)
that most Regional forms have been very (43:20 - 43:23)
good and I don't mean to badmouth any of (43:22 - 43:26)
them but like say for instance like I (43:23 - 43:28)
did I was a Pony fan that didn't like (43:26 - 43:31)
Gan I love gerian Pon for the record but (43:28 - 43:33)
like say I didn't like that would that (43:31 - 43:36)
would feel yeah it would be painful it (43:33 - 43:38)
would be a little painful but for me (43:36 - 43:41)
like alolan sandre does an amazing job (43:38 - 43:44)
at changing entirely what sandre is (43:41 - 43:47)
while keeping it the same Vibe it spins (43:44 - 43:50)
in a uh you know sideways instead of uh (43:47 - 43:53)
spinning like a bowling ball um becomes (43:50 - 43:56)
a little Igloo um it Blends in with the (43:53 - 43:58)
snow I I think that ice and steel are (43:56 - 44:01)
really cool typings um Steel's probably (43:58 - 44:03)
my second favorite behind ground like (44:01 - 44:06)
very cool Pokemon and then both forms of (44:03 - 44:08)
sand slash are very cool as well like (44:06 - 44:11)
I'm someone who like enjoys the entire (44:08 - 44:13)
evolutionary line of my favorite Pokemon (44:11 - 44:14)
I know there's like some people who are (44:13 - 44:16)
like I love Metagross I don't care about (44:14 - 44:18)
Metang I don't care about belda I think (44:16 - 44:20)
sand slash is awesome and like they did (44:18 - 44:22)
a really good job with that as well so (44:20 - 44:25)
like Kanto is my original favorite but I (44:22 - 44:28)
love alolan sand through um actually in (44:25 - 44:32)
competitive go like NAIC uh (44:28 - 44:35)
2023 I used alolan sand slash along with (44:32 - 44:38)
tapu so like that was really cool to use (44:35 - 44:39)
like my (44:38 - 44:41)
signature um competitive Pokemon but (44:39 - 44:44)
also the evolution of my favorite (44:41 - 44:47)
Pokemon like super super cool so that's (44:44 - 44:50)
that's an easy question easy favorite oh (44:47 - 44:52)
both of you have an easy time with that (44:50 - 44:55)
I have like 15 favorite Pokemon if I had (44:52 - 44:56)
to choose one it would probably probably (44:55 - 44:57)
be (44:56 - 45:01)
Blazin um I mentioned this last year but (44:57 - 45:03)
it's one of my favorite stories to tell (45:01 - 45:06)
uh my family moved across the country (45:03 - 45:09)
between first and second grade for me (45:06 - 45:11)
and that was around the time I was (45:09 - 45:13)
playing Pokemon Ruby and so at the same (45:11 - 45:17)
time I lost all of my human friends the (45:13 - 45:19)
only friends I got to keep were my (45:17 - 45:22)
Pokemon friends and so my Blazin my (45:19 - 45:25)
Torchic that was my very first uh female (45:22 - 45:26)
starter Pokemon which of all into a (45:25 - 45:30)
Blazin that I still have to this day is (45:26 - 45:33)
very special to me so cute I love that (45:30 - 45:37)
story love love love that story and (45:33 - 45:38)
because we got to elaborate a little (45:37 - 45:40)
more than you did Ace what is your (45:38 - 45:44)
favorite Evolution if you have one my (45:40 - 45:49)
favorite Evolution for the video podcast (45:44 - 45:53)
list is Leafeon I just I went to go grab (45:49 - 45:56)
it from behind me but um definitely uh (45:53 - 46:00)
Leafeon but the reason Eevee is like my (45:56 - 46:03)
favorite is it took a very long time to (46:00 - 46:05)
decide on what my favorite is and I'm (46:03 - 46:06)
like wow Eevee of course Eevee it's so (46:05 - 46:10)
basic but like I don't mind being basic (46:06 - 46:13)
with that pick um because I love Eevee (46:10 - 46:15)
and all of it Eevee lutions and I love (46:13 - 46:17)
how (46:15 - 46:19)
versatile Eevee can be especially with (46:17 - 46:21)
all the Eve utions and I feel like Eevee (46:19 - 46:24)
fits into my personality as well of (46:21 - 46:25)
being like this kind of like the way (46:24 - 46:27)
it's been portrayed in like Pokémon (46:25 - 46:29)
media and stuff and whatnot it's very (46:27 - 46:34)
like bubbly like cute and like um all (46:29 - 46:36)
the again the variety with the (46:34 - 46:38)
evolutions and everything I feel like (46:36 - 46:42)

into me loving Eevee so much and then (46:42 - 46:47)
Leon's my favorite just because I just (46:46 - 46:50)

I love that Umbreon is a second again (47:03 - 47:08)
basic I know but Umbreon is a second (47:05 - 47:12)
second favorite Umbreon is amazing to be (47:08 - 47:14)
fair I think where I was going to go (47:12 - 47:16)
after that is the question of what's (47:14 - 47:18)
your favorite Pokemon type and Anna you (47:16 - 47:21)
kind of answered this yes I love ground (47:18 - 47:25)

types like again cubones back there um I (47:51 - 47:56)
have a bunch that like I'll take (47:54 - 47:57)
whenever I'm competing at a regional (47:56 - 48:00)
I'll take a plus um where if I get on (47:57 - 48:02)
stream I can put it on stage like I have (48:00 - 48:04)
an inata back there that's been on (48:02 - 48:05)
stream a few times I obviously have (48:04 - 48:09)
sandre plushes both uh Kanto and Oland (48:05 - 48:11)
but yeah ground types just I love them I (48:09 - 48:14)
I love using them in battle it's a very (48:11 - 48:16)
strong offensive typing um and they're (48:14 - 48:18)
just there's so many cute little (48:16 - 48:23)
critters I I enjoy totally that yeah (48:18 - 48:25)
that's totally fair honestly ground (48:23 - 48:27)
types have never stood out to me until (48:25 - 48:29)
you're explaining how much you love (48:27 - 48:31)
them that's that's cool that's going to (48:29 - 48:34)
stick in my head now yeah me too you (48:31 - 48:37)
have do you have a favorite type if your (48:34 - 48:40)
favorite Pokemon is (48:37 - 48:40)
Eevee it's not normal I'll tell you that (48:40 - 48:47)
much um I I kind of I just like a lot of (48:43 - 48:48)
Pokemon that are generally like electric (48:47 - 48:52)
SL flying um I don't know what it is (48:48 - 48:53)
about like a lot of electric type (48:52 - 48:55)
Pokemon that I'm just such like a big (48:53 - 48:56)
sucker for (48:55 - 48:59)
there's I would say a good majority of (48:56 - 49:02)
them um I just love and then flying as (48:59 - 49:05)
well I just like a lot of birds I'm like (49:02 - 49:09)
a cat person I'm a bird person so (49:05 - 49:12)
um I just it only makes sense for flying (49:09 - 49:14)
and there's so many good flying typing (49:12 - 49:16)
uh flying Pokemon as well and just that (49:14 - 49:18)
dual typing together I also just really (49:16 - 49:20)
enjoy like I'm I love I think my (49:18 - 49:22)
favorite like bird Pokemon of all time (49:20 - 49:26)
is watr which is yeah yeah I think it (49:22 - 49:27)
electric flying right it starts off as (49:26 - 49:31)
electric flying okay so um I I can't (49:27 - 49:33)
really give a reason or rhyme as to why (49:31 - 49:36)
electric and flying are my favorite (49:33 - 49:39)
typings but they're definitely they're (49:36 - 49:41)
most likely my favorites (49:39 - 49:42)
[Applause] (49:41 - 49:45)
rather I mean that's totally fair and (49:42 - 49:47)
you choosing two types gives me the (49:45 - 49:50)
opportunity to choose more than one heck (49:47 - 49:54)
yeah uh if I had to choose one I'm (49:50 - 49:56)
starting to lean into fighting types (49:54 - 49:59)
more and more the newer fighting type (49:56 - 50:01)
Pokémon are just becoming more unique (49:59 - 50:03)
than any of the older ones they're not (50:01 - 50:06)
just people (50:03 - 50:06)
anymore but but we've got cool new (50:08 - 50:14)
fighting types here we've got Hui and uh (50:11 - 50:17)
sneez we've got sneezer we have got (50:14 - 50:19)
paron we've just got really cool (50:17 - 50:22)
fighting types at this point uh but (50:19 - 50:25)
otherwise dark and fire are my two other (50:22 - 50:28)
favorites so the firefighting is really (50:25 - 50:31)
close to my heart with that Blazin in (50:28 - 50:35)
there I get it yeah no n like did so (50:31 - 50:37)
much for fighting in general like you (50:35 - 50:39)
have both forms of Tauros like we hadn't (50:37 - 50:42)
gotten a water fighting type I guess we (50:39 - 50:44)
three forms of Tauros right right we at (50:42 - 50:47)
the Bas as well um but like I guess we (50:44 - 50:49)
just had U but like water fighting isn't (50:47 - 50:51)
that common of a type and we got both (50:49 - 50:53)
the Tauros and the (50:51 - 50:56)
cavel um like Pont (50:53 - 50:59)
and uh iron hands like being the first (50:56 - 51:02)
fighting bias great Tusk with the ground (50:59 - 51:05)
Fighting For the First Time iron Valiant (51:02 - 51:08)
like yeah I I completely agree with like (51:05 - 51:11)
fighting typ the fighting types are just (51:08 - 51:14)
getting better and better yeah electric (51:11 - 51:16)
sorry no I was just going to say yeah (51:14 - 51:17)
like now that you're like listing all (51:16 - 51:19)
these Pokemon I'm like wow yeah no (51:17 - 51:21)
actually fighting has gotten a lot (51:19 - 51:23)
better over the years cuz generally like (51:21 - 51:25)
if I'm picking a team or I'm making a (51:23 - 51:26)
team and Pokemon game usually I'm (51:25 - 51:29)
throwing fighting to the side or to the (51:26 - 51:33)
curve just like H Flo is so good Birds (51:29 - 51:36)
man birds birds are (51:33 - 51:38)
good lamigo is also really cool to make (51:36 - 51:42)
it's like super used for Speed running (51:38 - 51:43)
yep because it's got a ridiculously high (51:42 - 51:45)
base stat total and you can find it (51:43 - 51:47)
really early on I'm like it's just a (51:45 - 51:50)
silly bird but it's just a bird friend (51:47 - 51:53)
literally yeah I was convinced to use (51:50 - 51:56)
flamigo in my in the play through I did (51:53 - 52:00)
on stream of Pokemon Violet because it (51:56 - 52:02)
made the entire playthrough easier and I (52:00 - 52:05)
hadn't been a huge fan of it beforehand (52:02 - 52:07)
but I liked my (52:05 - 52:09)
flamigo that's great and then yeah (52:07 - 52:13)
electric flying like I I think kowol is (52:09 - 52:15)
like one of my favorite Regional Birds (52:13 - 52:17)
now just because it's super cool typing (52:15 - 52:19)
it's not a very common typing you have (52:17 - 52:23)
like oricorio oh my God I love oricorio (52:19 - 52:27)
imga like always (52:23 - 52:30)
Co I love that (52:27 - 52:33)
nice yeah uh the next question is going (52:30 - 52:36)
to be one that I think you both answered (52:33 - 52:39)
earlier on but favorite generation of (52:36 - 52:43)
Pokemon three three easily um I've (52:39 - 52:46)
played Sapphire like more than any other (52:43 - 52:48)
game I love hen as a region um when I (52:46 - 52:51)
went to Worlds um when I went to Japan (52:48 - 52:56)
for World um we spent a week in um (52:51 - 52:59)
in kushu which is the region that hen is (52:56 - 53:00)
based on and went to a bunch of the (52:59 - 53:02)
different cities that inspired it and (53:00 - 53:04)
then we went to canai for a week which (53:02 - 53:07)
was like the Johto inspiration and then (53:04 - 53:09)
worlds was in Yokohama which is uh (53:07 - 53:13)
Vermilion City in Kanto um or the (53:09 - 53:15)
inspiration um and like we did a week in (53:13 - 53:18)
Kanto but after being there in person as (53:15 - 53:20)
well like solidified hoen is like so (53:18 - 53:23)
cool to me it's it's so nature based it (53:20 - 53:26)
has tqu twal's like (53:23 - 53:31)
love toal 2 big friend I know yeah (53:26 - 53:34)
Generation 3 is also mine pretty much (53:31 - 53:36)
the same reason as Blazin it's the (53:34 - 53:38)
region I lived in when my family moved (53:36 - 53:39)
across the (53:38 - 53:44)
country but is you didn't play gen 3 (53:39 - 53:45)
quite the same way you were more of a (53:44 - 53:49)
Gen 4 I yeah well so technically I have (53:45 - 53:52)
Nostalgia glasses for Gen 4 um would I (53:49 - 53:54)
say it's my favorite confidently (53:52 - 53:57)
probably not to be completely honest um (53:54 - 53:59)
I know I love the generation because (53:57 - 54:01)
it's what I sunk the most time into but (53:59 - 54:03)
I feel like even though I've never (54:01 - 54:06)
played gen 3 I would enjoy gen 3 if it (54:03 - 54:09)
is nature-based like you y'all are (54:06 - 54:12)
saying um but I've also been interested (54:09 - 54:17)
in alola as well because just the again (54:12 - 54:20)
nature type of vibe I feel like I'm (54:17 - 54:23)
super into um but from Generations that (54:20 - 54:26)
I've played I feel like I would say that (54:23 - 54:29)
potentially a gener like a favorite (54:26 - 54:30)
generation honestly would be sword and (54:29 - 54:32)
shield I really really enjoyed those (54:30 - 54:36)
games and I really really enjoyed um (54:32 - 54:38)
just the (54:36 - 54:40)
entire playthrough all the way from like (54:38 - 54:42)
front to back yeah it's easy quote (54:40 - 54:43)
unquote (54:42 - 54:46)
it's it's quote unquote easy it's a (54:43 - 54:48)
Pokemon game we're all adults in Pokemon (54:46 - 54:50)
of course this conversation has been on (54:48 - 54:51)
this podcast so many times of course (54:50 - 54:53)
it's going to be easy we're adults we (54:51 - 54:55)
understand the game so it only makes (54:53 - 54:57)
sense that it's easy but like I just (54:55 - 55:00)
really enjoyed the region and going (54:57 - 55:02)
through each City and finding the (55:00 - 55:06)
Pokemon that were in that gen and (55:02 - 55:08)
I I just really enjoyed it so I feel (55:06 - 55:10)
like I mean I love scarlet and violet as (55:08 - 55:12)
well but (55:10 - 55:15)
I feel like sword and shield might be my (55:12 - 55:16)
favorite (55:15 - 55:19)
generation of the gens that I've played (55:16 - 55:21)
thus (55:19 - 55:25)
far nice I know a lot of people are (55:21 - 55:26)
honestly already looking back to sword (55:25 - 55:29)
and shield with kind of a bit of (55:26 - 55:31)
nostalgia just because of how scarlet (55:29 - 55:35)
and violet turned out (55:31 - 55:40)
yeah yeah no I'm I'm gen 3 but (55:35 - 55:43)
gen nine I really have ended up liking (55:40 - 55:47)
Pala a whole a whole lot so if I had to (55:43 - 55:49)
not choose gen 3 if we could only each (55:47 - 55:52)
claim one generation one one generation (55:49 - 55:54)
each I would probably go with Pala as my (55:52 - 55:55)
second favorite or the one that I would (55:54 - 55:58)
choose yeah Pala has an extremely strong (55:55 - 56:01)
Pokedex and I think that's like a huge (55:58 - 56:04)
factor in enjoying a generation oh (56:01 - 56:06)
yeahh yeah and that kind of covered our (56:04 - 56:09)
favorite main Series game two so what (56:06 - 56:12)
are our favorite games that aren't main (56:09 - 56:16)
Series games and is it all Pokemon (56:12 - 56:21)
go okay so Pokemon go is a cop out for (56:16 - 56:23)
me because it's like the games that I've (56:21 - 56:27)
like gained popularity through and like (56:23 - 56:28)
um gotten incredible opportunities (56:27 - 56:33)
through but actually like Pokemon XD is (56:28 - 56:36)
alltime like one of my favorite games in (56:33 - 56:39)
the Pokemon franchise like even (56:36 - 56:41)
competing with main Series games um (56:39 - 56:46)
Pokemon XD uh Gale of Darkness um for (56:41 - 56:49)
those who have no familiarity um it is (56:46 - 56:53)
the closest thing we had really to gen 9 (56:49 - 56:57)
but it was back in 2003 2004 like where (56:53 - 57:01)
it was 3D like you aren't on a grid um (56:57 - 57:04)
top down you go to different areas but (57:01 - 57:06)
like for the time on the GameCube it was (57:04 - 57:08)
like the closest thing we had to like (57:06 - 57:10)
open world as an idea you're not (57:08 - 57:12)
constrained in the same ways you are in (57:10 - 57:15)
like Pokemon games and then it's all (57:12 - 57:19)
double battles so um to me like gen 3 (57:15 - 57:21)
had double battles like that was it (57:19 - 57:24)
gimmick so to speak that in weather um (57:21 - 57:26)
and just being you know on the Game Boy (57:24 - 57:28)
Advance and and so on but like double (57:26 - 57:32)
battles were introduced in Ruby Sapphire (57:28 - 57:33)
emerald and then like fire red leaf (57:32 - 57:36)
green but they weren't fully explored (57:33 - 57:40)
and in Pokemon XD like the Dynamics of (57:36 - 57:42)
like oh if I have both of these Pokemon (57:40 - 57:44)
out I can cover like all these typings I (57:42 - 57:47)
can really power up like for instance my (57:44 - 57:50)
Eevee that I've evolved into a jolon and (57:47 - 57:52)
then like my M cargo or something like (57:50 - 57:56)
that and um like jolon can hit the water (57:52 - 57:59)
types and then um you know mag cargo can (57:56 - 58:01)
hit the grass types that resist electric (57:59 - 58:04)
like just like that level that surprise (58:01 - 58:06)
surprise I enjoy VGC now which is all (58:04 - 58:09)
doubles just super super cool gameplay (58:06 - 58:11)
and like childhood me it was like mind (58:09 - 58:15)
blown um but yeah obviously Pokemon go (58:11 - 58:20)
is like now now the easy winner for (58:15 - 58:20)
me I think for me I really so silly to (58:20 - 58:28)
say but I really enjoyed Battle (58:26 - 58:32)
Revolution on the Wii it was just such a (58:28 - 58:35)
fun game and was so silly and I would (58:32 - 58:38)
sing so many hours into that as a kid I (58:35 - 58:41)
still have um the game like the Wii I (58:38 - 58:44)
have the game disc and everything I just (58:41 - 58:46)
have to get my Wii fixed but like I kind (58:44 - 58:48)
of want to sink more hours into it and (58:46 - 58:49)
like (58:48 - 58:53)
re ReDiscover I guess re-experience (58:49 - 58:54)
re-experience that's the correct word (58:53 - 58:57)
thank you re-experience the the game all (58:54 - 58:59)
over again um and I didn't grow up (58:57 - 59:01)
playing Pokemon (58:59 - 59:05)
Snap On yeah I so I didn't yeah I didn't (59:01 - 59:06)
grow up playing the original Pokemon (59:05 - 59:10)
Snap but I got the original Pokemon Snap (59:06 - 59:12)
for my N64 and played a little bit of (59:10 - 59:14)
that and obviously the new Pokemon Snap (59:12 - 59:17)
as well I really enjoyed those as well (59:14 - 59:21)
I'm also one of my hobbies is (59:17 - 59:23)
photography so taking photography and (59:21 - 59:25)
Pokémon and putting them together there (59:23 - 59:28)
was just such a blast so really really (59:25 - 59:31)
enjoyed that as (59:28 - 59:33)
well that makes complete sense I don't (59:31 - 59:35)
know why I hadn't thought about you and (59:33 - 59:38)
Pokemon Snap before but yep I think cuz (59:35 - 59:40)
I just never really talk about it no one (59:38 - 59:42)
no one asked me about it and I don't I (59:40 - 59:43)
don't I just don't really talk about it (59:42 - 59:46)
I played it on stream once yeah it was (59:43 - 59:49)
kind of a game that had its time and (59:46 - 59:51)
then people don't think about it as much (59:49 - 59:55)
anymore it needs it needs a Hui and and (59:51 - 59:58)
C update I would I would in a in a (59:55 - 60:01)
heartbeat bu a DLC for new Pokemon Snap (59:58 - 60:04)
where I can see pictures of clad like oh (60:01 - 60:08)
my gosh yes give me all of the wats (60:04 - 60:11)
across just flying across I'll take five (60:08 - 60:14)
million photos of all of (60:11 - 60:17)
them that would be so good I think I (60:14 - 60:20)
think for me I I do have to say Pokémon (60:17 - 60:23)
go Pokémon go has kind of changed my (60:20 - 60:27)
life and it not Not only was has not (60:23 - 60:29)
only has been a tool for me to kind of (60:27 - 60:33)
get to know people all over the place (60:29 - 60:36)
but it's just something I can always go (60:33 - 60:39)
back to and know that I have friends (60:36 - 60:43)
there I don't know I love Pokemon go but (60:39 - 60:44)
I love Pokemon in (60:43 - 60:48)
general um I think I just mostly like (60:44 - 60:50)
the community from Pokémon go yeah I (60:48 - 60:52)
mean I enjoy Pokémon go as well anything (60:50 - 60:54)
Pokemon I'm going to like it but like I (60:52 - 60:55)
think more so my favorite part about (60:54 - 60:57)
Pokémon go is the community for sure (60:55 - 60:59)
like I really look forward to when I'm (60:57 - 61:02)
able to organizing like a little New (60:59 - 61:05)
York Meetup um to play a community day (61:02 - 61:06)
together or any other event that's (61:05 - 61:08)
happening (61:06 - 61:10)
and that's definitely like a standout (61:08 - 61:13)
for me for Pokémon go more so yeah I (61:10 - 61:14)
think (61:13 - 61:17)
without having a community around the (61:14 - 61:19)
game isn't quite as fun for me but one (61:17 - 61:21)
of the reasons I love it so much is (61:19 - 61:23)
because it helps me find that Community (61:21 - 61:25)
yeah (61:23 - 61:29)
and with that I think I want to ask did (61:25 - 61:32)
both of you watch the Pokemon presents (61:29 - 61:36)
presents okay what do you think as we're (61:32 - 61:38)
moving into this next year of Pokemon (61:36 - 61:40)
right before the 30th (61:38 - 61:45)
Anniversary I really I mean I I already (61:40 - 61:47)
listened to the podcast about the (61:45 - 61:49)
present next couple years I guess so I'm (61:47 - 61:51)
like trying to keep that in the back of (61:49 - 61:52)
my head and think back on my own (61:51 - 61:54)
opinions that I had but I thought it was (61:52 - 61:56)
a really really fun presents uh (61:54 - 61:57)
definitely I was like why is this so (61:56 - 62:01)
fast but I I don't know I I guess I (61:57 - 62:02)
could slow it down I could rewind I (62:01 - 62:04)
could do whatever and rewatch those (62:02 - 62:07)
parts but I was like why is this so fast (62:04 - 62:08)
I'm having (62:07 - 62:12)
Whiplash um but I'm I'm really looking (62:08 - 62:14)
forward to another Legends game I really (62:12 - 62:17)
enjoy Legends archus uh was definitely a (62:14 - 62:21)
struggle to play the game initially (62:17 - 62:22)
which is the hand eye coordination (62:21 - 62:24)
because I don't usually play games like (62:22 - 62:26)
that I can never imagine myself playing (62:24 - 62:27)
like (62:26 - 62:28)
[Music] (62:27 - 62:32)
a Elden ring type of game so kind of (62:28 - 62:34)
working in sort (62:32 - 62:37)
of very loose version of those type of (62:34 - 62:40)
mechanics of like dodging and attacking (62:37 - 62:42)
and stuff like that was a struggle (62:40 - 62:44)
initially but once I got the hang of it (62:42 - 62:45)
oh my gosh such a fun game so I'm (62:44 - 62:49)
looking forward to another Legends (62:45 - 62:52)
hopefully another Legend Style game um I (62:49 - 62:53)
it's called Legends so I assume it's (62:52 - 62:55)
going to be the same mechanic we see (62:53 - 62:59)
what Legend sty means well yeah who (62:55 - 63:01)
knows maybe it's just the Aesthetics (62:59 - 63:03)
maybe it is the mechanics I don't know (63:01 - 63:07)
we'll see but um that and also just (63:03 - 63:09)
being able to this is a way to force me (63:07 - 63:12)
to play X and Y since I haven't played (63:09 - 63:13)
it yet and I'm looking forward to it and (63:12 - 63:15)
then learning more about like the lore (63:13 - 63:17)
of Pokemon uh through Legends I'm (63:15 - 63:21)
looking forward to and the Sleep event I (63:17 - 63:25)
am over the moon about so excited I (63:21 - 63:26)
don't know if you play Pokemon sleep as (63:25 - 63:30)
well Anna but um really excited for the (63:26 - 63:33)
Pokemon sleep event and and the Elric (63:30 - 63:35)
week coming up the den stok electric (63:33 - 63:37)
You' got the electric types right there (63:35 - 63:40)
God I'm so (63:37 - 63:40)
excited yeah D den and and Reiko right (63:41 - 63:48)
are both coming yeah I um I have been on (63:44 - 63:50)
and off with sleep but I enjoy it I love (63:48 - 63:53)
the premise um the presents yeah (63:50 - 63:55)
obviously uh PL (63:53 - 63:58)
Za um is like the big ticket I'm very (63:55 - 63:59)
excited I I guess technically they've (63:58 - 64:03)
already arrived but sharet uh armor and (63:59 - 64:07)
yeah sered in go is like obviously go (64:03 - 64:11)
player very excited um I'm like a (64:07 - 64:15)
very um different group in go I'm I'm (64:11 - 64:16)
what I would consider the minority that (64:15 - 64:18)
thinks it's really cool that like go (64:16 - 64:21)
goes out of order like I'll have I'll (64:18 - 64:23)
hear people who are like very upset very (64:21 - 64:26)
upset that we didn't get like groupy and (64:23 - 64:32)
and is kind of losing in Pokemon go but (64:26 - 64:34)
yeah but I think it's cool like I think (64:32 - 64:36)
it's cool that like we haven't even (64:34 - 64:39)
gotten like manif and archus obviously I (64:36 - 64:41)
would love everything to be in go but I (64:39 - 64:42)
understand their model has to be like a (64:41 - 64:45)
drift feed like keep people playing and (64:42 - 64:47)
and keep having like exciting events so (64:45 - 64:50)
like I didn't want to have to wait (64:47 - 64:52)
forever for Gen N9 Pokemon because I (64:50 - 64:55)
think they're really cool so I'm fine (64:52 - 64:57)
with the comments of like we're not even (64:55 - 64:59)
done Gen 6 like what are we doing jump (64:57 - 65:02)
into gen nine um because I want I want (64:59 - 65:05)
Sarah legi in particular to be strong um (65:02 - 65:08)
in competitive it's yep unlikely in go (65:05 - 65:10)
PVP just because it's it's very attack (65:08 - 65:12)
weighted and like that doesn't convert (65:10 - 65:15)
well but we've seen armor Rouge is like (65:12 - 65:18)
very viable in the video game um it was (65:15 - 65:21)
like a core armor Rouge plus indd was (65:18 - 65:24)
like a very strong core Duo um for (65:21 - 65:26)
competitive EGC at least in the (65:24 - 65:28)
beginning yeah at least in the beginning (65:26 - 65:31)
it's it's kind of tapered off but um (65:28 - 65:33)
it's called s spam because it's two (65:31 - 65:36)
psychic types and uh it spamed expanding (65:33 - 65:39)
Force which is a really powerful move um (65:36 - 65:41)
and it's always like it's still talked (65:39 - 65:43)
about even if it's not as common as it (65:41 - 65:45)
was in the first uh couple months and (65:43 - 65:48)
then in the trading card game there's an (65:45 - 65:50)
armor rou card that lets you move fire (65:48 - 65:54)
energy around on your board and it's not (65:50 - 65:57)
like met up but it's usable and serad (65:54 - 66:01)
just hasn't got that Niche interesting (65:57 - 66:02)
to me because they're putting so much (66:01 - 66:05)
weight and because of the (66:02 - 66:08)
anime yep it is it is also like (66:05 - 66:11)
objectively the more popular like it is (66:08 - 66:13)
it is the cool cool bladesman I think (66:11 - 66:15)
they're both really cool but if their (66:13 - 66:17)
shinies had reversed their color schemes (66:15 - 66:20)
sured would be my one of my favorite (66:17 - 66:23)
Pokemon but they don't they just change (66:20 - 66:26)
the eyes so but but exactly what you're (66:23 - 66:29)
saying like they hyped up theed so much (66:26 - 66:32)
and it's just kind of fallen short and (66:29 - 66:34)
well go it hasn't had its moment yet but (66:32 - 66:36)
like in both uh competitive games it's (66:34 - 66:40)
been allowed in um so obviously go (66:36 - 66:42)
player really really excited by that but (66:40 - 66:45)
um Pokemon Legends Zygarde um or Pokemon (66:42 - 66:47)
Legends Za I guess it doesn't explicitly (66:45 - 66:51)
say zygard but we all know yeah is super (66:47 - 66:54)
exciting same reasons that you said a uh (66:51 - 66:57)
not having played X and Y but loving X (66:54 - 67:00)
and Y as like a deck like I love fairy (66:57 - 67:02)
type Sylveon um is one of my favorite (67:00 - 67:06)
Pokemon as well um (67:02 - 67:10)
and the legend Style game are super cool (67:06 - 67:12)
to me um for a couple reasons one like I (67:10 - 67:15)
still play them um I did a stream like a (67:12 - 67:17)
friend of mine who also streams will do (67:15 - 67:20)
like a shiny hunting challenge and (67:17 - 67:23)
invite me on because um archus has like (67:20 - 67:24)
the (67:23 - 67:28)
noise and like very visual uh indication (67:24 - 67:30)
of a shiny um and we'll just sit for (67:28 - 67:32)
like two or three hours and see who can (67:30 - 67:34)
get a shiny in like each of the (67:32 - 67:36)
locations we'll have like little Bingo (67:34 - 67:38)
cards for it it's a it's a really good (67:36 - 67:42)
time and then also like archus to me (67:38 - 67:44)
feels or or Legends assuming that the (67:42 - 67:47)
mechanics say feels like an evolution of (67:44 - 67:49)
Pokemon go and I've always found that (67:47 - 67:54)
very interesting in the main line of (67:49 - 67:57)
game GES how that inspiration has come (67:54 - 67:59)
through because the obvious one is (67:57 - 68:01)
Pokémon go stepping over to Pokémon (67:59 - 68:04)
let's go Pikachu it feels very inspired (68:01 - 68:07)
you have the same berries that you have (68:04 - 68:09)
in Pokemon go it's a little bit expanded (68:07 - 68:11)
you have like silver brassberries and so (68:09 - 68:15)
on but it's a departure from the main (68:11 - 68:18)
remakes and the main system of games (68:15 - 68:21)
it's not it's not your regular catching (68:18 - 68:23)
system it's not your regular yep um (68:21 - 68:25)
Pokemon (68:23 - 68:29)
and through yeah like archus I don't (68:25 - 68:30)
mean to say that archus is anything like (68:29 - 68:33)
Pokemon go one to one but like the (68:30 - 68:35)
method of going about interacting with (68:33 - 68:37)
Pokemon catching them it feels like a (68:35 - 68:40)
level of uh departure from the main (68:37 - 68:43)
series from games like um sword and (68:40 - 68:45)
shield Scarlet Violet that kind of went (68:43 - 68:48)
on the main path and then archus feels (68:45 - 68:50)
like it's branched off from this like (68:48 - 68:52)
Pokemon let's go Pikachu and Eevee um (68:50 - 68:55)
which like has this ancestor in go yep (68:52 - 68:57)
uh different approach to the franchise (68:55 - 68:59)
approach to the franchise that I really (68:57 - 69:01)
love because again I'm sure you love (68:59 - 69:03)
this about the games as well Ace like (69:01 - 69:06)
seeing the Pokemon in nature um again (69:03 - 69:08)
also has like kind of vibes from snap (69:06 - 69:11)
where it's like I get to see a spel (69:08 - 69:13)
rolling across the beach and I get to (69:11 - 69:15)
throw a Pokeball at it like feeling much (69:13 - 69:18)
more connected than selecting it in a (69:15 - 69:21)
battle menu of like throw the Pokeball (69:18 - 69:23)
um both great like again doesn't take (69:21 - 69:24)
away the Joy from the main series but (69:23 - 69:28)
his beautiful departure and and a just a (69:24 - 69:30)
wonderful way to experience Pokemon so (69:28 - 69:32)
obviously excited for a new Legends game (69:30 - 69:35)
and obviously the the mega symbol (69:32 - 69:37)
popping up at the end like (69:35 - 69:41)
everyone made a bunch people happy yeah (69:37 - 69:43)
how how many years have people been (69:41 - 69:46)
saying bring beg megas back they did it (69:43 - 69:48)
they did it they listen look they listen (69:46 - 69:50)
right we we'll see if they keep (69:48 - 69:52)
complaining when there are only like (69:50 - 69:53)
five new (69:52 - 69:55)
Megas (69:53 - 69:58)
Mega fly again Flygon please flygon's so (69:55 - 70:01)
good flygon's a good pick also yeah Yes (69:58 - 70:04)
actually are either of you excited about (70:01 - 70:08)
the new TCG Pocket game yeah yeah yeah (70:04 - 70:09)
we don't really know that much about it (70:08 - 70:11)
yet but that was the other new new thing (70:09 - 70:12)
that they really (70:11 - 70:15)
announced yeah it was very interesting (70:12 - 70:17)
because like again I've started playing (70:15 - 70:20)
the trading card game a bit more um my (70:17 - 70:23)
other play is is predominantly a trading (70:20 - 70:24)
card game play and they've they've (70:23 - 70:28)
looped me in and um obviously being a (70:24 - 70:32)
Pokemon go player I have had experience (70:28 - 70:35)
watching when Niantic the parent company (70:32 - 70:38)
of Pokemon go along with ppci will (70:35 - 70:39)
announce a different game and people (70:38 - 70:41)
will be like they're abandoning Pokemon (70:39 - 70:42)
go they're they're putting all these (70:41 - 70:45)
resources in this other game um it's so (70:42 - 70:47)
over they should focus on like the good (70:45 - 70:49)
game and so now I follow a bunch of (70:47 - 70:52)
trading card game people and seeing like (70:49 - 70:54)
oh they're making this game for babies (70:52 - 70:56)
like they're they're diverting resources (70:54 - 71:00)
from from the main Pokemon app it's so (70:56 - 71:03)
but it's very funny it's very funny um (71:00 - 71:06)
at least as someone who knows it's not (71:03 - 71:08)
the case and like you can make things (71:06 - 71:11)
for different audiences yep um but as (71:08 - 71:13)
someone who just loves the card game as (71:11 - 71:14)
well and loves like the art in (71:13 - 71:17)
particular like I loved seeing pocket I (71:14 - 71:20)
think it's I think it's really cool and (71:17 - 71:23)
um I think like the other thing that (71:20 - 71:25)
like kind of t this is like it will (71:23 - 71:28)
bring more people into the main trading (71:25 - 71:30)
card game it's not it's not going to be (71:28 - 71:33)
everyone but there are absolutely people (71:30 - 71:34)
who will see that and be like oh it's (71:33 - 71:38)
it's Baby's First PCG it's it's um they (71:34 - 71:41)
have a program at at regionals and ic's (71:38 - 71:43)
um I'm sure if I'm not sure if they had (71:41 - 71:46)
it at Portland 23 but they had it at na (71:43 - 71:48)
called the first step program and they (71:46 - 71:50)
have people there that will walk you (71:48 - 71:51)
through the trading card game and I'm (71:50 - 71:53)
like this is just another level of that (71:51 - 71:55)
and it's super exciting as someone who (71:53 - 71:57)
enjoys that we'll see I feel like the (71:55 - 72:00)
the matches might be a little different (71:57 - 72:01)
with kind of alternate rules and that (72:00 - 72:03)
kind of thing right oh definitely it's (72:01 - 72:05)
it's closer to like the like Battle (72:03 - 72:08)
Academy I think like where there's (72:05 - 72:10)
products that already exist for like (72:08 - 72:11)
aiming at a younger audience or people (72:10 - 72:14)
who are just newer to the game yeah so (72:11 - 72:16)
I've definitely exist I mean I've seen (72:14 - 72:19)
more people comparing it to to Marvel (72:16 - 72:22)
snap okay which makes it even funnier (72:19 - 72:24)
when you say that there are people in (72:22 - 72:27)
the TCG scene saying this is like baby's (72:24 - 72:29)
first Pokemon game but this is the (72:27 - 72:33)
Marvel snap of Pokemon TCG and how does (72:29 - 72:34)
that (72:33 - 72:38)
work yeah no I mean it's I I don't mean (72:34 - 72:41)
to like say that it's any majority like (72:38 - 72:44)
the TCG Community is funny comment cool (72:41 - 72:47)
yeah but it is it is really interesting (72:44 - 72:49)
and also like how it plays into drawing (72:47 - 72:52)
in collectors as well I think is great (72:49 - 72:54)
like a lot of the ad advertisement was (72:52 - 72:57)
like look at these new cinematic arts (72:54 - 72:58)
and I'm (72:57 - 73:00)
like it's always obviously again Pokémon (72:58 - 73:03)
go player like the collectors versus the (73:00 - 73:05)
people who are interested in just doing (73:03 - 73:07)
raids versus the like PVP players (73:05 - 73:09)
there's so many ways to enjoy Pokemon (73:07 - 73:11)
and like this looks like another piece (73:09 - 73:14)
that's just a hit on hitting multiple of (73:11 - 73:17)
those Avenues in in a very good (73:14 - 73:20)
way my my only concern I guess with the (73:17 - 73:22)
TCG app is that it does become like I I (73:20 - 73:25)
know nothing about Marvel snap right (73:22 - 73:27)
that's what the game is called I know (73:25 - 73:29)
nothing about that I've been recommended (73:27 - 73:32)
to it uh by like multiple friends being (73:29 - 73:33)
like you should try this and I'm just (73:32 - 73:35)
like I I I don't have time for another (73:33 - 73:37)
game on my phone that's the thing (73:35 - 73:41)
but um with that said I don't know if it (73:37 - 73:43)
has like a gacha mechanic at all but I (73:41 - 73:45)
am hoping that it's not it doesn't lean (73:43 - 73:48)
too heavily into that and it is like (73:45 - 73:50)
another accessible way for someone to (73:48 - 73:52)
get into the TCG I remember I did learn (73:50 - 73:56)
the TCG a couple cou years back and then (73:52 - 73:58)
life just gets in the (73:56 - 74:01)
way forgot everything I forgot (73:58 - 74:04)
everything I kind of I I can probably (74:01 - 74:05)
like if I pick it up I'll probably learn (74:04 - 74:08)
it again pretty quickly but like it (74:05 - 74:10)
would be nice to have a (74:08 - 74:13)
mobile friendly thing to pick up and (74:10 - 74:16)
relearn the T better than the existing (74:13 - 74:20)
one yeah yeah yeah exactly that um and (74:16 - 74:22)
I'm especially looking forward to like (74:20 - 74:24)
the art aspect as well CU I just love (74:22 - 74:26)
appreciating the art of the Pokemon (74:24 - 74:28)
cards and the work that the artist put (74:26 - 74:31)
into it um so I'm looking forward to (74:28 - 74:34)
that as well but I just I am hoping it's (74:31 - 74:36)
not like too leaning too heavily onto (74:34 - 74:39)
the the gacha aspects yeah I hope I (74:36 - 74:41)
really hope it's not micro too (74:39 - 74:43)
microtransaction which I wouldn't be (74:41 - 74:45)
surprised if it is but I hope it's not (74:43 - 74:49)
priced like Pokemon sleep is that's (74:45 - 74:49)
fair that's very (74:49 - 74:55)
fair um I I think we are pretty close to (74:52 - 74:57)
coming to a close here if either of you (74:55 - 74:59)
have any other Pokemon questions you (74:57 - 75:02)
want to (74:59 - 75:02)
ask I feel like I had a question and it (75:03 - 75:09)
might be kind of (75:07 - 75:11)
gone I don't know if you have anything (75:09 - 75:12)
Anna I'm trying to while I'm trying to (75:11 - 75:15)
remember so this probably like ties in (75:12 - 75:17)
somewhat to favorite generation but (75:15 - 75:20)
because it was on the mind today um cuz (75:17 - 75:23)
like I'm I'm looking at um like I'm I'm (75:20 - 75:25)
learning that TCG more and and leaning (75:23 - 75:26)
into it a little bit more and I was (75:25 - 75:30)
looking at um buying nicer copies of (75:26 - 75:31)
boss's orders which is like a very (75:30 - 75:33)
staple card in that game um it's like a (75:31 - 75:35)
supporter card it makes you swap out the (75:33 - 75:38)
opponent uh a Pokemon of your choosing (75:35 - 75:40)
from the opponent's bench into their (75:38 - 75:43)
active and so I was looking at which (75:40 - 75:45)
ones like which characters have been (75:43 - 75:46)
printed on that and it's fairly limited (75:45 - 75:49)
it's like uh gvani um (75:46 - 75:51)
thyrus (75:49 - 75:55)
um um (75:51 - 75:55)
uh that's that's awesome that you said (75:56 - 76:01)
that did not know how to pronounce that (75:59 - 76:04)
I only know it because it was explained (76:01 - 76:07)
to me that it's it it is linked to a (76:04 - 76:09)
German pronunciation that I wasn't aware (76:07 - 76:13)
of but yes and then um yeah and then um (76:09 - 76:18)
Leander the Gen six um antagonist or or (76:13 - 76:22)
like villain org leader again haven't (76:18 - 76:24)
played Jens 5 six and S like I know (76:22 - 76:27)
Giovani I know Cyrus very well and um I (76:24 - 76:29)
was really upset that they don't have (76:27 - 76:33)
one of Archie and Ma or Maxi or of um I (76:29 - 76:34)
think it would be really cool if they (76:33 - 76:36)
had one of any from gen N I guess (76:34 - 76:37)
spoilers for people who have not (76:36 - 76:40)
finished the storyline of gen n but (76:37 - 76:42)
like but like I would hope it's finished (76:40 - 76:45)
by now most people have finished by now (76:42 - 76:47)
I would hope I would hope and I (76:45 - 76:48)
obviously she's not a villain in the (76:47 - 76:50)
same way as like so of the other (76:48 - 76:52)
characters but I guess I was wondering (76:50 - 76:55)
like what's your favorite Pokemon (76:52 - 76:57)
[Music] (76:55 - 77:00)
antagonist that's a good question and it (76:57 - 77:02)
doesn't have to be the games like if (77:00 - 77:04)
it's like Mewtwo from the first movie (77:02 - 77:06)
that's cool (77:04 - 77:06)
too gosh that's a good question it it (77:07 - 77:12)
entirely at this point depends on how (77:10 - 77:15)
you define (77:12 - 77:18)
antagonist I I'm very loose with with (77:15 - 77:21)
definitions I'm fine to uh if you can (77:18 - 77:26)
justify it to take that you know yeah (77:21 - 77:28)
cuz like even like Jesse and James (77:26 - 77:29)
absolutely antagonist are they really (77:28 - 77:31)
villains (77:29 - 77:36)
no they raised that boy but like (77:31 - 77:39)
yeah yeah I mean (77:36 - 77:42)
if the story had worked out differently (77:39 - 77:44)
I would have really wanted to say Miss (77:42 - 77:46)
Brier because she seemed like a really (77:44 - 77:49)
interesting character and didn't end up (77:46 - 77:52)
being (77:49 - 77:56)
one yeah yeah she was just so focused on (77:52 - 77:57)
on our (77:56 - 78:00)
studies yep yeah the definitely I agree (77:57 - 78:04)
the idea of what Miss Brier could have (78:00 - 78:09)
been um was pretty was pretty great I (78:04 - 78:12)
was very much so looking forward to that (78:09 - 78:14)
um I guess with like scarlet and violet (78:12 - 78:17)
at mind I don't really (78:14 - 78:21)
consider her a like I guess antagonist (78:17 - 78:22)
but I really I really did enjoy my time (78:21 - 78:26)
with like Mona in general I think Hannah (78:22 - 78:28)
can agree as well like it was she was (78:26 - 78:32)
just I would always be laughing with her (78:28 - 78:34)
um I think everyone also loves Arvin as (78:32 - 78:35)
well but I figured that's like a that's (78:34 - 78:38)
like an easy answer like I I that's (78:35 - 78:39)
that's an obvious one especially with (78:38 - 78:42)
the storyline of him and having his pet (78:39 - 78:47)
go through or his mbos maosi mosti I (78:42 - 78:50)
think is how it's pronounced um having (78:47 - 78:51)
that whole story line being something (78:50 - 78:53)
that is relatable to me and having to (78:51 - 78:56)
deal with a sick pet before um but like (78:53 - 78:59)
with neona just like the pureness of her (78:56 - 79:03)
energy I just genuinely really enjoyed (78:59 - 79:05)
again not really I guess an antagonist (79:03 - 79:06)
per se she's definitely more obviously (79:05 - 79:10)
like a rival you know but like I really (79:06 - 79:13)
I really I like even though I say sword (79:10 - 79:15)
and shield is like my potentially my (79:13 - 79:17)
favorite generation the storyline or the (79:15 - 79:20)
character development in the base game (79:17 - 79:24)
of scarlet and violet is by far my (79:20 - 79:27)
favorite in the Pokemon series DLC (79:24 - 79:30)
debatable base game for me really really (79:27 - 79:32)
really loved yeah I think people are (79:30 - 79:34)
going to look back on those Rivals very (79:32 - 79:36)
fondly (79:34 - 79:39)
yeah one thing one one character that (79:36 - 79:42)
popped into my mind was uh (79:39 - 79:44)
n n was kind of the one thing I was (79:42 - 79:46)
looking forward to the most when people (79:44 - 79:49)
were hyping up potential gen five (79:46 - 79:51)
remakes I've heard so many good things (79:49 - 79:54)
about him I know nothing about him but I (79:51 - 79:55)
mean (79:54 - 79:58)
I I would be interested in experiencing (79:55 - 79:59)
that story again but we're not going to (79:58 - 80:04)
for who knows how long well I I wouldn't (79:59 - 80:06)
be surprised I wouldn't be surprised if (80:04 - 80:08)
genun five remakes get announced not at (80:06 - 80:11)
the Pokemon present and like it happens (80:08 - 80:13)
in the next couple years yeah what (80:11 - 80:15)
actually that brings up a point a silly (80:13 - 80:18)
it's a silly question but if there were (80:15 - 80:20)
to be Gen 5 remakes like in the same (80:18 - 80:23)
vein of brilliant d diamond and Shining (80:20 - 80:23)
C (80:23 - 80:26)
what do you think it would be (80:23 - 80:30)
named what what are y'all's (80:26 - 80:32)
theories (80:30 - 80:35)
two well we already have those would it (80:32 - 80:37)
be sorry would it be like sorry black (80:35 - 80:40)
three white three would it be something (80:37 - 80:42)
else (80:40 - 80:45)
entirely bright white dark black I don't (80:42 - 80:47)
know I don't know that was completely (80:45 - 80:50)
stupid I know but yeah cuz like I don't (80:47 - 80:53)
know if you if you go back to like using (80:50 - 80:55)
like gems and stuff you could have like (80:53 - 80:57)
obsidian black and marble white I don't (80:55 - 80:59)
that sounds significantly cooler than (80:57 - 81:00)
what I said (80:59 - 81:05)
but just a silly question yeah yeah no I (81:00 - 81:06)
think I can't come up with a better (81:05 - 81:07)
answer than that I just don't want those (81:06 - 81:09)
g (81:07 - 81:12)
i I want to revisit the region but (81:09 - 81:14)
there's no way that they have done a a (81:12 - 81:16)
revisit or a remake recently that I want (81:14 - 81:20)
to revisit that region in I just yeah I (81:16 - 81:25)
want the Omega Ruby alha Sapphire yeah (81:20 - 81:25)
that's that's another reason I feel so (81:25 - 81:29)
blessed as a Gen 3 enjoyer is like got (81:26 - 81:33)
very good remakes yes same here what (81:29 - 81:35)
were what was the antagonist you were (81:33 - 81:39)
thinking of oh I mean uh I like AR and (81:35 - 81:42)
Maxi a lot um I think that they're (81:39 - 81:44)
really fun in being like obviously (81:42 - 81:47)
fallible villains in like both their (81:44 - 81:50)
thought processes and like um like I (81:47 - 81:52)
don't know I think seeing like faults (81:50 - 81:55)
and villains makes for very relatable um (81:52 - 81:58)
Pokemon go head here I love Sierra as (81:55 - 82:00)
well I think that Sierra um one of the (81:58 - 82:03)
leaders team go rocket um obviously (82:00 - 82:06)
doesn't have the like lore flesh out (82:03 - 82:07)
that some of the main series villains (82:06 - 82:11)
have but also having been in Pokemon go (82:07 - 82:13)
so long like there's enough little bits (82:11 - 82:16)
like in like press releases or in in (82:13 - 82:18)
game events that you actually do like (82:16 - 82:19)
they've had some like where your (82:18 - 82:22)
research uh story line is like narrated (82:19 - 82:26)
by a of team go rocket yep just recently (82:22 - 82:29)
yeah just recently during the go tourno (82:26 - 82:33)
um and then like very enjoying women (82:29 - 82:36)
representation in video games um I think (82:33 - 82:38)
that her style is super cool she's got (82:36 - 82:40)
the purple lipstick like (82:38 - 82:43)
very I I think in recent generations of (82:40 - 82:45)
Pokemon like more recent Pokemon (82:43 - 82:47)
character designs have been amazing and (82:45 - 82:49)
I love like Sierra's character design I (82:47 - 82:54)
think um so again bias go player not (82:49 - 82:56)
going to have the fan base that someone (82:54 - 83:00)
like n or like someone like um Lysander (82:56 - 83:03)
or any of the like Giovani any of the (83:00 - 83:05)
main series villains will have or (83:03 - 83:09)
antagonist will have um but High go (83:05 - 83:11)
player like the the go character as well (83:09 - 83:14)
I mean I think she's the I won't even (83:11 - 83:17)
say the most popular I will say the only (83:14 - 83:20)
popular of the team go rocket leaders (83:17 - 83:23)
yeah yeah fair I like them all I think (83:20 - 83:24)
Cliff Cliff has like a beard that looks (83:23 - 83:26)
like a Pokeball I'm like that's very (83:24 - 83:29)
cool but no Sierra is definitely (83:26 - 83:32)
definitely faren away the people's (83:29 - 83:34)
favorite yeah I think if I had to pick (83:32 - 83:37)
between the three I I would also say I (83:34 - 83:39)
would definitely also say (83:37 - 83:44)
Sierra all right one final question if (83:39 - 83:45)
they (83:44 - 83:47)
do uh (83:45 - 83:50)
not have new starters for Pokemon (83:47 - 83:54)
Legends AZ do do you know which starter (83:50 - 83:56)
you would go (83:54 - 84:01)
with so that's gen six so that (83:56 - 84:05)
froger um you chose a middle Evolution (84:01 - 84:09)
oh froy sorry (84:05 - 84:09)
froy nobody ever lists the middle (84:09 - 84:15)
Evolution sorry right froy Froakie (84:12 - 84:18)
Chespin and uh fenin right just double (84:15 - 84:25)
Ching okay de well would be my choice I (84:18 - 84:28)
extremely popular starter you know fan (84:25 - 84:30)
favorite basic but like greninja's (84:28 - 84:33)
really cool and uh I like that whole (84:30 - 84:35)
line obviously I went to Frogadier for (84:33 - 84:36)
some reason but it's got the bubble (84:35 - 84:39)
scarf like it's it's a really cool yeah (84:36 - 84:43)
it's a good design I like I like um I (84:39 - 84:45)
like all three lines from gen six I (84:43 - 84:48)
think uh fenin uh Del Fox are really (84:45 - 84:50)
cool I love Del Fox being like a very (84:48 - 84:55)
stereotypical like uh Wizard or wit like (84:50 - 84:58)
figure um I like how like D and D it (84:55 - 85:01)
feels as we got the we've got the tank (84:58 - 85:04)
we've got the the (85:01 - 85:07)
Assassin Wait no that's the the the the (85:04 - 85:11)
with yeah the spell Mage there we go Rog (85:07 - 85:14)
Rogue tank and Mage right I've I've only (85:11 - 85:17)
done one one shot of D and D so that's (85:14 - 85:19)
potenti as far as my knowledge goes (85:17 - 85:21)
don't listen to me the idea is it's (85:19 - 85:24)
fantasy they all have 15 synonyms (85:21 - 85:26)
totally (85:24 - 85:28)
fair yeah I think (85:26 - 85:31)
uh I would if if it those were the (85:28 - 85:32)
options I would definitely go to fenan (85:31 - 85:34)
route just cuz like that Mage feeling (85:32 - 85:38)
and everything and I foxes are foxes are (85:34 - 85:41)
cool um another animal that I really (85:38 - 85:44)
appreciate and admire um so I I I (85:41 - 85:46)
usually don't pick fire starters (85:44 - 85:49)
interestingly enough um but fenin would (85:46 - 85:50)
be one of them just because I like the (85:49 - 85:52)
whole line I like how it evolves and (85:50 - 85:54)
it's pretty cool I mean all all three of (85:52 - 85:59)
them are also cool to me but I would say (85:54 - 86:04)
fenin nice I think I picked fenin my no (85:59 - 86:05)
I don't actually remember whether I (86:04 - 86:07)
picked fenin or froi my first time (86:05 - 86:08)
around but this time I think I would go (86:07 - 86:09)
with (86:08 - 86:14)
Chespin I don't exactly know why the (86:09 - 86:16)
Pokemon go Community Day for Chespin (86:14 - 86:18)
made me like that that Pokemon and that (86:16 - 86:22)
line way more than I ever had but it did (86:18 - 86:24)
so now I I I would actually go with (86:22 - 86:26)
Chespin and we'll see if they do (86:24 - 86:29)
eventually get mega forms in these new (86:26 - 86:31)
games that for some reason they're going (86:29 - 86:35)
to have to explain aren't in the (86:31 - 86:37)
original yeah oh I'm sure it's going to (86:35 - 86:38)
be so smooth it's going to be it's going (86:37 - 86:40)
to make complete (86:38 - 86:42)
110% (86:40 - 86:46)
sense there's going to be no (86:42 - 86:50)
gaps I'm sure well if they do if they do (86:46 - 86:52)
it in the future like I've seen people (86:50 - 86:53)
talk about what whether it's in the past (86:52 - 86:57)
or in the future or in both like um (86:53 - 86:59)
compared to like pla being strictly in (86:57 - 87:01)
the past so like if it's in the future (86:59 - 87:04)
then they can be like we developed mega (87:01 - 87:06)
stones for these new (87:04 - 87:08)
Pokemon they they could I don't think (87:06 - 87:11)
it's in the future but they could yeah I (87:08 - 87:12)
have no idea I don't even know if it's (87:11 - 87:17)
going to be a time yeah and with that I (87:12 - 87:18)
think we're all looking forward to the (87:17 - 87:21)
future of Pokemon yeah it has been a (87:18 - 87:23)
really cool time talking to both of you (87:21 - 87:26)
here thank you both so much for coming (87:23 - 87:28)
on to this podcast and being part of the (87:26 - 87:31)
