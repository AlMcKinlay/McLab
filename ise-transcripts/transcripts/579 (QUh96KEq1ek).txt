579th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:25 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:28 - 0:34)
I am still in Japan I am here with Greg (0:30 - 0:37)
you're never coming back (0:34 - 0:37)
I have upgraded my sleep (0:37 - 0:44)
we replaced the room darkeners in our (0:41 - 0:49)
bedroom finally after the curtains (0:44 - 0:50)
so Shades that you pull down (0:49 - 0:53)
we had ones that were probably about 20 (0:50 - 0:55)
years old and they really didn't do (0:53 - 0:56)
anything about the light outside so we (0:55 - 0:59)
installed new ones and it is like a tomb (0:56 - 1:00)
in there you shut the door and you're (0:59 - 1:03)
not seeing nothing so perfect for sleep (1:00 - 1:06)
no lights no light coming in and no (1:03 - 1:08)
sound no heat (1:06 - 1:10)
I've just sealed it off into this giant (1:08 - 1:12)
sleep chamber so that I could always get (1:10 - 1:14)
100 on my sleep because I've decided to (1:12 - 1:17)
devote my life to being a Pokemon sleep (1:14 - 1:19)
master (1:17 - 1:19)
well (1:19 - 1:22)

Hannah's still there if you want to see (1:44 - 1:47)
her (1:46 - 1:49)
um I'm pretty sure we're still there too (1:47 - 1:52)
we may be however kidnapped by (1:49 - 1:54)
extremists it depends I don't know what (1:52 - 1:57)
the situation is (1:54 - 1:59)
Bobby was supposed to be on but uh he is (1:57 - 2:01)
in a tropical storm right now (1:59 - 2:04)
um and so we got budget Bobby which is (2:01 - 2:09)
just Bob we cut off a b and a y (2:04 - 2:11)
folks Steve is really scraping the (2:09 - 2:13)
bottom of the barrel here right now (2:11 - 2:16)
let's let's bring him on (2:13 - 2:20)
average of a sucker is Bob (2:16 - 2:20)
yeah but are you actually spending money (2:22 - 2:28)
on incubators because that is thick that (2:25 - 2:30)
is the metrics by (2:28 - 2:33)
I did buy some diamonds and sleep so (2:30 - 2:35)
don't judge me (2:33 - 2:35)
I (2:38 - 2:41)
Bob that may shoot just a sucker is that (2:41 - 2:47)
it are all Roberts Barbies and Bobs (2:44 - 2:49)
fools Bob (2:47 - 2:52)
it is because because it's um I'm also (2:49 - 2:54)
spending money on shiny cardboard and (2:52 - 2:56)
I'm also spending money on unite battle (2:54 - 3:00)
passes listen I I hate money so much (2:56 - 3:03)
I don't have an income just give it to (3:00 - 3:05)
me and I'll do little dances or (3:03 - 3:06)
something I don't know correctly when we (3:05 - 3:07)
meet each other I'm gonna buy you (3:06 - 3:12)
something really okay cool okay but no I (3:07 - 3:13)
was I was telling I was telling Stephen (3:12 - 3:16)
Greg I I before I jumped on here I was (3:13 - 3:17)
playing unite really early in the (3:16 - 3:20)
morning bad decision to make another (3:17 - 3:23)
decision to make early morning on a (3:20 - 3:28)
Sunday it's horrible it's horrible (3:23 - 3:28)
that aren't at church so they're (3:29 - 3:35)
unsupervised children who don't know how (3:32 - 3:38)
to go south (3:35 - 3:38)
I don't know much I don't know as much (3:38 - 3:43)
of unite as YouTube but I know that (3:41 - 3:45)
unite is very dependent on the times you (3:43 - 3:47)
play oh yeah (3:45 - 3:51)
oh yes although I surprised myself (3:47 - 3:54)
yesterday 6 p.m Saturday I had a string (3:51 - 3:57)
of solids like oh these are good people (3:54 - 3:59)
and then it hits seven o'clock and I'm (3:57 - 4:02)
like and now I'm in the bad Zone (3:59 - 4:07)
now it's now we are tanking harder than (4:02 - 4:09)
I've ever tanked in my life I need to be (4:07 - 4:13)
done but I have to do my Mewtwo Y (4:09 - 4:14)
dailies (4:13 - 4:17)
okay before we get to you mewty (4:14 - 4:19)
uh I am missile Japan so I have a (4:17 - 4:21)
million stories a lot Pokemon related (4:19 - 4:23)
but we have to get to the Pokemon news (4:21 - 4:26)
first and you guys somehow suckered me (4:23 - 4:28)
into a two and a half hour show last (4:26 - 4:29)
week hey (4:28 - 4:31)
then we did (4:29 - 4:32)
reading to you this is what happens when (4:31 - 4:34)
you 've been prepared and you don't have (4:32 - 4:37)
talking points you let us go (4:34 - 4:40)
into those like let's talk about hacked (4:37 - 4:44)
Pokemon yeah well that's on Hannah (4:40 - 4:45)
laughs (4:44 - 4:48)
okay before we get to the news where (4:45 - 4:51)
there's Pokemon sleep news but (4:48 - 4:54)
Greg apparently revamped their whole (4:51 - 4:56)
bedroom to play Pokemon sleep I'm still (4:54 - 5:00)
paying playing Pokemon sleep Bob we'll (4:56 - 5:03)
start with you you bought gems I have (5:00 - 5:07)
not bought what is going on I've (5:03 - 5:12)
I've only giving it the monthly pass but (5:07 - 5:14)
no other money so I am paying for the (5:12 - 5:17)
monthly pass the I I bought the gems (5:14 - 5:18)
only for the good camp tickets I think (5:17 - 5:20)
that's the only good item in that game (5:18 - 5:23)
is just get the good camp ticket pop it (5:20 - 5:25)
on for a week get more ingredients get (5:23 - 5:28)
more hungry Pokemon want to befriend you (5:25 - 5:30)
other than that I found a lot of the (5:28 - 5:32)
other items just not good so I'm only (5:30 - 5:34)
using gems to buy the good camp ticket (5:32 - 5:36)
because my snow left right now it's like (5:34 - 5:39)
that's like another ten dollars a week (5:36 - 5:41)
so I just won't eat food for you I don't (5:39 - 5:42)
know (5:41 - 5:45)
what's going on (5:42 - 5:45)
I'm so invested it's fun I'm so invested (5:46 - 5:51)
in the game because I want to make my (5:50 - 5:53)
Snorlax big and fat and I'm getting (5:51 - 5:55)
there I'm an Ultra Ball three I want to (5:53 - 5:57)
get the master I need to do that but (5:55 - 5:58)
here's this you know there's like (5:57 - 6:00)
multiple levels at the end of the week (5:58 - 6:01)
the game's like hey all that great (6:00 - 6:03)
progress you made I'm just gonna take it (6:01 - 6:06)
away and you're gonna start over again (6:03 - 6:08)
I like being disappointed Greg let's (6:06 - 6:10)
just do it again apparently let's do it (6:08 - 6:12)
again (6:10 - 6:12)
um (6:12 - 6:18)
I have not spent money in sleep besides (6:14 - 6:21)
the pass I do agree with what Bob said I (6:18 - 6:24)
think the good sleep ticket is probably (6:21 - 6:27)
the best item like I do (6:24 - 6:29)
you because you normally get sometimes (6:27 - 6:31)
without it you don't get any hungry (6:29 - 6:34)
Pokemon it's like I don't know I don't (6:31 - 6:37)
know what the statistics the the role (6:34 - 6:39)
rate is but it feels like maybe like 70 (6:37 - 6:42)
30 like 70 percent you get a hungry 30 (6:39 - 6:44)
you don't get any with the ticket it's (6:42 - 6:50)
like one to three it feels a lot (6:44 - 6:52)
um you get the more ingredients you get (6:50 - 6:54)
the bigger pot you get all that stuff (6:52 - 6:56)
I don't think a lot of the items are (6:54 - 6:58)
really worth it like I don't see myself (6:56 - 7:01)
using the pillow or the whistle like the (6:58 - 7:04)
like I have incense but like (7:01 - 7:05)
I don't (7:04 - 7:07)
feel like I need double experience at (7:05 - 7:09)
this point or like it doesn't feel like (7:07 - 7:12)
a month into the game I'm like oh I (7:09 - 7:14)
really need that maybe I'm wrong maybe (7:12 - 7:16)
it's (7:14 - 7:17)
uh (7:16 - 7:21)
but I like the game so much I don't know (7:17 - 7:26)
what it I could it's like simple but I (7:21 - 7:29)
get so excited to see like Atkins now (7:26 - 7:31)
because or just any Pokemon I guess but (7:29 - 7:33)
I'll use Atkins as an example like I (7:31 - 7:35)
woke up there was three Atkins two of (7:33 - 7:36)
them were sleeping on their their back (7:35 - 7:38)
so little Billy was showing it was like (7:36 - 7:40)
oh ecken's belly that's cool (7:38 - 7:42)
but like I love seeing the roles on the (7:40 - 7:45)
Pokemon of like oh this one has really (7:42 - 7:48)
good skills or this one's nature is (7:45 - 7:51)
counterproductive to its skills so we we (7:48 - 7:52)
won't do this one so I'm like still (7:51 - 7:54)
looking for good Pokemon (7:52 - 7:56)
that I can do (7:54 - 8:00)
um and then yeah I just think that it's (7:56 - 8:03)
so cool that there's a lot of depth if (8:00 - 8:04)
you care about that if you want to look (8:03 - 8:07)
at each Pokemon stats and everything (8:04 - 8:08)
um but also if you just want to like (8:07 - 8:10)
wake up to like five different Pokemon (8:08 - 8:12)
every day like that's also still pretty (8:10 - 8:14)
Charming in itself (8:12 - 8:17)
yeah no I am I think next week I get to (8:14 - 8:18)
visit the third island for the first (8:17 - 8:19)
time I don't know if either you have (8:18 - 8:21)
gone to the third island yet so I'm (8:19 - 8:23)
excited to see I'm excited to see new (8:21 - 8:25)
Pokemon that that come in (8:23 - 8:27)
um I got one on top of snorlax's belly (8:25 - 8:29)
which was which was fun to see but I (8:27 - 8:30)
just love seeing all the little (8:29 - 8:32)
animations I like seeing just I think (8:30 - 8:34)
they had a lot more personality the way (8:32 - 8:36)
they designed this app and this the (8:34 - 8:37)
animation I think it just looks really (8:36 - 8:39)
nice and clean but no I've been I've (8:37 - 8:40)
been enjoying it I'm looking forward to (8:39 - 8:42)
seeing what I get next week at the new (8:40 - 8:46)
campsite so um yeah looking forward (8:42 - 8:47)
I think the one thing we haven't talked (8:46 - 8:50)
about with sleep and why I think I like (8:47 - 8:52)
it so much is if you look at like sword (8:50 - 8:54)
and shield Scarlet Violet Pokemon go (8:52 - 8:58)
Pokemon Masters they all use the same 3D (8:54 - 9:00)
models and they all have like the same (8:58 - 9:04)
idle animation where Pokemon sleep (9:00 - 9:07)
doesn't and so like seeing these Pokemon (9:04 - 9:11)
in different poses being sleepy drooping (9:07 - 9:13)
drooling (9:11 - 9:16)
like moving around it's (9:13 - 9:20)
it's like refreshing (9:16 - 9:20)
I don't know I like the game I think (9:20 - 9:24)
it's great (9:22 - 9:26)
no it's great I like that (9:24 - 9:27)
it's fine (9:26 - 9:29)
it's fine (9:27 - 9:32)
your whole room is ready your whole room (9:29 - 9:35)
is good I'm not I'm not that invested (9:32 - 9:38)
into it I I still play it because it it (9:35 - 9:41)
with the go plus plus it takes a lot (9:38 - 9:43)
less (9:41 - 9:46)
from me and I can just be like fine I'll (9:43 - 9:48)
just do it when I think about it in the (9:46 - 9:50)
morning and then if I'm if I think about (9:48 - 9:53)
it before I go to bed at night like oh I (9:50 - 9:55)
should probably feed that thing (9:53 - 9:58)
um and then I move on with my life like (9:55 - 10:00)
I I think they're cute like the thing (9:58 - 10:01)
that keeps me going is because I do (10:00 - 10:03)
think it's cute and Charming I but I (10:01 - 10:06)
don't (10:03 - 10:06)
care about the collection aspect I've (10:06 - 10:12)
been collecting in all of these games (10:10 - 10:15)
for almost 30 years now (10:12 - 10:18)
and I'm at a point in my life where I'm (10:15 - 10:20)
like I have (10:18 - 10:22)
precious little control over what (10:20 - 10:25)
happens in this game I just wake up I'm (10:22 - 10:27)
surprised but or not surprised what's (10:25 - 10:29)
there give it a biscuit and move on with (10:27 - 10:33)
my day like okay it's just I I don't (10:29 - 10:36)
want it to take a lot from my life and I (10:33 - 10:37)
don't let it take a lot for my life so (10:36 - 10:41)
I'm not that invested in it (10:37 - 10:43)
well (10:41 - 10:45)
you could be invested this is just my (10:43 - 10:47)
segue (10:45 - 10:49)
um (10:47 - 10:49)
the news in itself is no one is (10:51 - 10:58)
reporting on Pokemon sleep so it's (10:55 - 11:01)
really hard to find an article that (10:58 - 11:04)
pulled from the Pokemon presents and (11:01 - 11:06)
then laid it out in a format that I (11:04 - 11:09)
could read on the show Charlie intel.com (11:06 - 11:13)
did that website (11:09 - 11:13)
sites that did (11:14 - 11:21)
um but the first event is going to be (11:17 - 11:22)
good sleep day (11:21 - 11:28)
and that will take place on August 30th (11:22 - 11:30)
and during good sleep days Snorlax (11:28 - 11:32)
drowsy power will become stronger and it (11:30 - 11:34)
will allow players to attract more (11:32 - 11:36)
Pokemon to their camps than on regular (11:34 - 11:38)
days your sleep score will also be (11:36 - 11:40)
boosted (11:38 - 11:42)
um and then (11:40 - 11:44)
their (11:42 - 11:46)
they say there's not a lot of details (11:44 - 11:47)
but it will be available to all players (11:46 - 11:50)
you don't have to purchase a ticket all (11:47 - 11:53)
you have to do is log in to do it (11:50 - 11:57)
and yeah I don't know how amazing it'll (11:53 - 11:58)
be but (11:57 - 12:02)
that's supposed to be August 30th (11:58 - 12:04)
and then (12:02 - 12:08)
it should end on August 31st and I (12:04 - 12:09)
they're saying it's supposed to (12:08 - 12:11)
correspond with a full moon I don't know (12:09 - 12:14)
moon cycles so I'm gonna trust that (12:11 - 12:15)
that's (12:14 - 12:17)
right (12:15 - 12:19)
if we're supposed to get a full moon at (12:17 - 12:20)
the end of August I'm assuming that's (12:19 - 12:23)
right (12:20 - 12:23)
um (12:23 - 12:27)
yeah it's supposed to be for the fullest (12:24 - 12:29)
on August 30th (12:27 - 12:32)
fullest of moons yes (12:29 - 12:36)
it will be a blue moon too apparently (12:32 - 12:40)
only the best for Snorlax (12:36 - 12:43)
all right we have two unite players here (12:40 - 12:46)
so let's heck yeah shift gears over to (12:43 - 12:50)
Pokemon unite Mega Mewtwo Y is (12:46 - 12:54)
worse than Mega Mewtwo X and I don't (12:50 - 12:56)
know why people would want to play y (12:54 - 12:59)
over X (12:56 - 12:59)
okay I have questions but let me go (12:59 - 13:03)
through the press release okay uh a (13:01 - 13:05)
Mewtwo that can evolve into Mega Mewtwo (13:03 - 13:08)
X debuted uh (13:05 - 13:11)
the island as a melee all-arounder now (13:08 - 13:14)
players can see the other side of the (13:11 - 13:16)
genetic Pokemon by obtaining the metoo (13:14 - 13:19)
unite uh a Mewtwo unite license that (13:16 - 13:22)
allows them to use the awesome power of (13:19 - 13:25)
Mega Mewtwo Y o Mega b2x specializes in (13:22 - 13:27)
melee basic attacks and bolstering its (13:25 - 13:30)
defense y specializes in ranged basic (13:27 - 13:34)
attacks and Rising its damage (13:30 - 13:37)
they're the same Pokemon but com but (13:34 - 13:39)
unlock completely different play Styles (13:37 - 13:41)
their words not mine I don't know you (13:39 - 13:43)
guys can verify uh unique experiences (13:41 - 13:47)
both mewtwos are separate but only one (13:43 - 13:48)
that was one of my questions I guess (13:47 - 13:50)
that's answered but only one Mewtwo can (13:48 - 13:52)
be picked by each team (13:50 - 13:57)
if you obtain the Y license y (13:52 - 14:02)
um you can obtain license y mu2 I don't (13:57 - 14:03)
why did they just change it on me why (14:02 - 14:06)
did they put the Y before (14:03 - 14:06)
taking part of the Mewtwo's Crystal Cave (14:08 - 14:13)
challenge (14:11 - 14:15)
um eventually or maybe by the time this (14:13 - 14:17)
goes up you can buy (14:15 - 14:21)
it with gems it's like 28 the event goes (14:17 - 14:24)
on for like 28 days just it's not that (14:21 - 14:26)
hard to do (14:24 - 14:29)
okay so don't buy it don't buy it just (14:26 - 14:32)
like uh there are there are so many (14:29 - 14:33)
events happening right now that give you (14:32 - 14:36)
free dice rolls too like you can get (14:33 - 14:38)
these licenses really quick just do the (14:36 - 14:41)
free thing don't pay money for it (14:38 - 14:45)
it's also saying why is strong against (14:41 - 14:48)
buzzwall but weak against zorark (14:45 - 14:51)
I can not confirm or deny but that's (14:48 - 14:53)
what pokemon.com is saying (14:51 - 14:55)
I mean yeah buzzwall has to get super (14:53 - 14:58)
super close so technically you don't (14:55 - 15:01)
have to get super close with why you (14:58 - 15:06)
just stay in the back and pew pew but (15:01 - 15:06)
okay so why is the GameCube handle not (15:07 - 15:12)
as good as the other one (15:09 - 15:12)
so (15:13 - 15:16)
most (15:17 - 15:20)
fights (15:18 - 15:24)
it is difficult (15:20 - 15:28)
to stay out of melee range like there (15:24 - 15:32)
are a ton of things that (15:28 - 15:35)
want to get in close and so the good (15:32 - 15:38)
thing about Mewtwo X is in those big (15:35 - 15:41)
battles mu2 X gets this huge defense (15:38 - 15:43)
increase the stats go huge the minute it (15:41 - 15:45)
make us like everybody scatters the (15:43 - 15:47)
minute you see it Go Mega because you're (15:45 - 15:50)
like nobody's going to survive this (15:47 - 15:53)
thing and it has ways of pulling you to (15:50 - 15:55)
it (15:53 - 15:58)
to like nope you're going nowhere it can (15:55 - 16:00)
pull you off your base so you stop (15:58 - 16:02)
healing it like has all of these things (16:00 - 16:03)
that just make it this sort of scary (16:02 - 16:06)
Unstoppable juggernaut (16:03 - 16:09)
and why just feels like a worse (16:06 - 16:10)
decidueye (16:09 - 16:13)
because it has to stay away it's things (16:10 - 16:17)
it pushes people away but so many of (16:13 - 16:20)
these melee attackers have ways of (16:17 - 16:24)
getting in close like zorark who can (16:20 - 16:27)
just pop to you and since you aren't (16:24 - 16:29)
getting a defense boost you're getting (16:27 - 16:32)
an attack boost when you why it doesn't (16:29 - 16:34)
matter if you're dead (16:32 - 16:38)
and it is just it is a less interesting (16:34 - 16:43)
play style in the current meta there are (16:38 - 16:46)
I think ranged Pokemon like Delphox that (16:43 - 16:49)
do that job better that have better (16:46 - 16:52)
Escape that have better abilities to (16:49 - 16:53)
trap (16:52 - 16:55)
it is just it is (16:53 - 16:58)
there's very little reason why you would (16:55 - 17:00)
pick it over the more balanced (16:58 - 17:01)
established ones other than the fact (17:00 - 17:03)
that it's Mewtwo Bob You can disagree (17:01 - 17:06)
but that's sort of where I'm at with it (17:03 - 17:08)
no no Greg I think you hit it on the (17:06 - 17:09)
head because (17:08 - 17:11)
uh I haven't played me too why yet to be (17:09 - 17:13)
honest uh I've done YouTube X because (17:11 - 17:16)
I'm a degenerate uh and yeah I am (17:13 - 17:18)
absolutely listen I I am I have to play (17:16 - 17:21)
evil if I have to no Mewtwo X definitely (17:18 - 17:22)
has (17:21 - 17:24)
Mewtwo X definitely has that benefit of (17:22 - 17:27)
going in and sustaining a lot of damage (17:24 - 17:29)
like so my build you know I use a move (17:27 - 17:31)
called recover because I like to be in (17:29 - 17:34)
the battle I am when I'm Mega Mewtwo X (17:31 - 17:36)
I'm smashing and I'm getting my defense (17:34 - 17:38)
I'm also recovering also Sidetrack I (17:36 - 17:40)
think it's a great move because (17:38 - 17:42)
um so your future site actually I like (17:40 - 17:43)
future site because you pull someone (17:42 - 17:45)
away into you and then you just go ham (17:43 - 17:47)
on them I agree there's a lot more (17:45 - 17:49)
better ranged uh attackers like I like (17:47 - 17:52)
using chandelor Espeon even Italian just (17:49 - 17:56)
destroyed you know crit attacking uh my (17:52 - 17:58)
opponents because they should be on the (17:56 - 18:00)
outside other than that you go in you (17:58 - 18:01)
fight and then that's where Mewtwo X has (18:00 - 18:04)
more sustainability yeah than mu2y mut2i (18:01 - 18:07)
is okay but if you were like well how (18:04 - 18:09)
evil do I want to be today you want to (18:07 - 18:12)
be more evil (18:09 - 18:12)
and then everybody just quits surrenders (18:15 - 18:20)
at at minute wait what are you saying (18:17 - 18:22)
are you saying X is stronger than (18:20 - 18:26)
zashian oh yeah it have not hammered (18:22 - 18:28)
they've hammered zashian a bit into the (18:26 - 18:31)
ground rightfully so they are still (18:28 - 18:34)
they are (18:31 - 18:37)
sort of hammering X into the ground but (18:34 - 18:39)
they've brought it into the point where (18:37 - 18:42)
you can still win against it if (18:39 - 18:44)
everybody focuses kind of like where you (18:42 - 18:46)
had to be for zashian but it is still (18:44 - 18:48)
overpowered and if there's a comfy on (18:46 - 18:51)
that side just quit just take take the (18:48 - 18:54)
just take the penalty Fair Play points (18:51 - 18:56)
and be like I'm done close the game I'll (18:54 - 18:58)
come back in 10 minutes because this is (18:56 - 19:02)
going to be a miserable experience from (18:58 - 19:05)
start to finish is going to be awful (19:02 - 19:08)
yeah you see you see a comfy you see an (19:05 - 19:10)
Umbreon you see a lot or a Lapras (19:08 - 19:14)
Universe game I played yesterday was (19:10 - 19:17)
Mewtwo X zashian Lapras comfy and I (19:14 - 19:19)
didn't even remember what the the fifth (19:17 - 19:21)
was because it didn't matter I'm like (19:19 - 19:23)
Elaine Cinderella let's call it Elaine (19:21 - 19:25)
Cinder race (19:23 - 19:25)
which is like why are you there good for (19:26 - 19:31)
you you're trying (19:29 - 19:32)
thank you (19:31 - 19:34)
so I saw (19:32 - 19:36)
um like a bunch of people really excited (19:34 - 19:37)
me to coming to unite like people that (19:36 - 19:39)
were like I'm coming back to the game oh (19:37 - 19:40)
yeah this is this is the Pokemon that's (19:39 - 19:43)
gonna bring me back why are they are (19:40 - 19:44)
definitely there there are a ton of (19:43 - 19:46)
returning players I see their little (19:44 - 19:49)
icon all the time of you've returned I I (19:46 - 19:52)
I've moved into master rank so I don't (19:49 - 19:55)
see them as often because there's still (19:52 - 19:57)
a lot of them are still in veteran and (19:55 - 19:58)
expert (19:57 - 20:01)
but when I was in Ultra working my way (19:58 - 20:03)
up I would have a team of three (20:01 - 20:06)
returning players by the symbol like the (20:03 - 20:08)
little there's a little there's a this (20:06 - 20:11)
little circle with a person in it and (20:08 - 20:12)
I'm like oh I mean there's a lot of (20:11 - 20:14)
people who are back for this especially (20:12 - 20:16)
since you have to play (20:14 - 20:18)
pretty much (20:16 - 20:21)
every day for about seven days to get (20:18 - 20:23)
both licenses if you want to get them (20:21 - 20:26)
fast you can do it in about seven days (20:23 - 20:28)
um and so you'll see a bunch of people (20:26 - 20:29)
and then of course (20:28 - 20:32)
Mewtwo X was super super fun to play and (20:29 - 20:34)
super overpowering and you just won (20:32 - 20:36)
matches like you you (20:34 - 20:38)
was the Hershey food problem we'll put (20:36 - 20:40)
push button win match (20:38 - 20:44)
um and that's sort of how X is and I (20:40 - 20:45)
think Y is more disappointing because (20:44 - 20:47)
it's definitely not push button win (20:45 - 20:49)
match (20:47 - 20:53)
so what are their megas respectfully (20:49 - 20:56)
doing because that's their unite move (20:53 - 20:59)
right it's going no mega they're unite (20:56 - 21:03)
moving not going Mega you they so you a (20:59 - 21:05)
certain amount of Pokemon and build up (21:03 - 21:09)
your mega meter and then you transform (21:05 - 21:12)
and so if you're when you see him (21:09 - 21:13)
YouTube come in you are everybody's (21:12 - 21:15)
looking at that meter to see how close (21:13 - 21:17)
they are to transforming into X because (21:15 - 21:20)
their stats explode and they become a (21:17 - 21:24)
juggernaut and then it lasts the Mewtwo (21:20 - 21:26)
me the Mega meter depletes and then they (21:24 - 21:28)
go back to normal so people just (21:26 - 21:29)
scattered to wait for it to go back to (21:28 - 21:31)
normal because they're much easier to (21:29 - 21:33)
deal with when they're not Megan their (21:31 - 21:36)
unite hits everybody on (21:33 - 21:39)
the map no matter where they are (21:36 - 21:41)
um it creates a big circle which is (21:39 - 21:43)
pretty easy to get out of once you see (21:41 - 21:45)
it forming you just eject button or (21:43 - 21:47)
speed out of the circle and you don't (21:45 - 21:50)
get hit but it's hard in a team fight (21:47 - 21:53)
when you're all pumped together and it (21:50 - 21:54)
does it because there's just no escaping (21:53 - 21:56)
that so it's really that also makes me (21:54 - 21:59)
2x better for their unite because they (21:56 - 22:01)
know when everybody's clustered and can (21:59 - 22:04)
hit whereas Y is hoping because it's at (22:01 - 22:05)
a distance that people aren't going to (22:04 - 22:08)
scatter when they see it (22:05 - 22:10)
um wait so the United's do the same (22:08 - 22:12)
they're nice exactly the same (22:10 - 22:15)
oh both unite see the exact same thing (22:12 - 22:19)
um yeah so they have to be attacking to (22:15 - 22:20)
build up their (22:19 - 22:24)
meter except wise meter I believe just (22:20 - 22:26)
builds up over time as they sort of (22:24 - 22:28)
float around (22:26 - 22:30)
um so technically the mega (22:28 - 22:33)
sooner but they have to they have to get (22:30 - 22:35)
into they have to be paying attention to (22:33 - 22:37)
get into fights to make it matter so (22:35 - 22:40)
you'll see a Mewtwo Y Mega in the middle (22:37 - 22:42)
of the Jungle with nothing around like (22:40 - 22:45)
cool that did nothing like you you (22:42 - 22:47)
weren't paying attention you didn't get (22:45 - 22:48)
into a fight you could have helped us (22:47 - 22:51)
you were just that's just wasted whereas (22:48 - 22:55)
ax is like always in people's faces (22:51 - 22:56)
um and you're always like watching that (22:55 - 22:59)
meter like it's too close I gotta run I (22:56 - 23:01)
need to get off to somewhere else (22:59 - 23:04)
because it's going to destroy me if I (23:01 - 23:07)
what's it becomes Mega I mean I think (23:04 - 23:10)
that's just a sort of weird design (23:07 - 23:13)
choice they made but it makes why (23:10 - 23:15)
less (23:13 - 23:18)
fun to play it's harder to use its (23:15 - 23:20)
resources x x just does everything (23:18 - 23:23)
better (23:20 - 23:23)
yeah over time like you'll start to you (23:25 - 23:30)
know I I think since now that Mewtwo X (23:28 - 23:31)
has been out for a little bit you can (23:30 - 23:33)
play around me to x a little bit more (23:31 - 23:35)
effectively especially with the unite (23:33 - 23:38)
move unless I get sent back from a hoopa (23:35 - 23:41)
Hall and I die in home base because (23:38 - 23:44)
Mewtwo's Thing by but you start to see (23:41 - 23:46)
that these these openings in in their (23:44 - 23:48)
weakness so like like Greg said you can (23:46 - 23:50)
see the gauge going up you know do you (23:48 - 23:51)
Retreat back do you not engage in that (23:50 - 23:54)
fight and let them waste their waste (23:51 - 23:56)
their Mega moment (23:54 - 23:58)
um but yeah I think if you're coming (23:56 - 24:01)
back to the game Mewtwo X is really a (23:58 - 24:03)
me2y in that sense it's really appealing (24:01 - 24:05)
for new players to come back into the (24:03 - 24:06)
game I think that's what Pokemon unite (24:05 - 24:08)
wanted to do is hey we have a Pokemon (24:06 - 24:10)
you know this Pokemon (24:08 - 24:13)
yeah easy it's probably popular (24:10 - 24:16)
yeah and I say easy to to start off with (24:13 - 24:18)
I mean it does take some skill to really (24:16 - 24:19)
know how to you know use those Pokemon (24:18 - 24:21)
but you can jump right in with a Mewtwo (24:19 - 24:23)
X get back into the game be like oh I (24:21 - 24:25)
miss doing this and I want to get back (24:23 - 24:26)
and yeah play more and spend more time (24:25 - 24:29)
and all that stuff you don't need skill (24:26 - 24:32)
until masters with Mewtwo X yeah or BTY (24:29 - 24:34)
you don't really needs it is kind of a (24:32 - 24:36)
push button the the interesting thing (24:34 - 24:38)
about (24:36 - 24:41)
I think dealing with mu2x and mu2y is (24:38 - 24:43)
that we all learn from zashian the best (24:41 - 24:46)
way to deal with it is to starve it from (24:43 - 24:48)
experience because neither one can Mega (24:46 - 24:52)
until level five so if you can invade (24:48 - 24:57)
jungle Steelix experience go hard on it (24:52 - 24:59)
in lane and steal it like the longer you (24:57 - 25:03)
can keep it from getting to level five (24:59 - 25:06)
the better off your are overall just (25:03 - 25:08)
being able to deal with it (25:06 - 25:11)
um and so like the same things we (25:08 - 25:13)
learned about when you saw zashian was (25:11 - 25:15)
just run and eat all the experience as (25:13 - 25:17)
fast as you can it doesn't matter if you (25:15 - 25:19)
die as long as you are stealing that (25:17 - 25:21)
experience so it cannot raise its level (25:19 - 25:23)
to get to five (25:21 - 25:26)
you'll have a better time (25:23 - 25:27)
um (25:26 - 25:29)
yeah jungle invade is becoming a bigger (25:27 - 25:30)
thing because of that because a lot of (25:29 - 25:32)
me Jews go to Jungle so you'll see (25:30 - 25:34)
intellion running in there to just steal (25:32 - 25:36)
everything and get out because it can (25:34 - 25:39)
really well get in and steal since it's (25:36 - 25:40)
invisible (25:39 - 25:43)
um invisible I'm surprised there hasn't (25:40 - 25:46)
been more stabilized going into jungle (25:43 - 25:48)
because abelai does do invisibility and (25:46 - 25:51)
stealing a lot better (25:48 - 25:53)
um I just think they've slammed that (25:51 - 25:55)
poor little guy so far into the ground (25:53 - 25:56)
that people are like (25:55 - 25:58)
um (25:56 - 26:00)
I've stopped writing it so (25:58 - 26:06)
last unite question now that we've seen (26:00 - 26:09)
two Pokemon that well Mewtwo's the same (26:06 - 26:12)
but X and Y you can only pick one right (26:09 - 26:14)
you can have both (26:12 - 26:18)
do we and now we've seen Mega do we see (26:14 - 26:21)
them introducing Mega Charizard down the (26:18 - 26:24)
line and then there's three Charizards (26:21 - 26:28)
regular mega Y Mega X only one can be on (26:24 - 26:30)
the team (26:28 - 26:33)
I mean I wouldn't put it past them (26:30 - 26:35)
um I mean again what everybody would (26:33 - 26:38)
come back for a Charizard event (26:35 - 26:41)
um I think I think that it I mean the (26:38 - 26:43)
thing is is we all thought it would be (26:41 - 26:45)
difficult to tell the EVS apart and they (26:43 - 26:47)
fix that with the symbols so you would (26:45 - 26:48)
know (26:47 - 26:52)
which Charizard to get the issue with (26:48 - 26:54)
that is (26:52 - 26:57)
it already takes Charizard (26:54 - 27:01)
level nine to become a Charizard so it (26:57 - 27:03)
feels weird to have them say you (27:01 - 27:06)
wouldn't get your mega ability until you (27:03 - 27:09)
became a Charizard at level nine and the (27:06 - 27:10)
only way they would fix that is by (27:09 - 27:13)
moving those Evolutions up which means (27:10 - 27:14)
they would have to do (27:13 - 27:18)
evolutions of a Pokemon so fast (27:14 - 27:21)
that it that it wouldn't it wouldn't (27:18 - 27:23)
feel right I could see them doing it but (27:21 - 27:24)
I think they would need to really figure (27:23 - 27:26)
out (27:24 - 27:29)
what they wanted I think it'd be more (27:26 - 27:32)
likely for them to change (27:29 - 27:35)
the unite move to allow it to for its (27:32 - 27:38)
unite to make it Mega for a longer stint (27:35 - 27:41)
than how they're doing it from YouTube I (27:38 - 27:42)
could see that working and then being (27:41 - 27:44)
able to keep (27:42 - 27:46)
because like we've already proved with (27:44 - 27:47)
dragon pulp that (27:46 - 27:49)
they'll do whatever they want with you (27:47 - 27:52)
night timers like Dragon Ball just like (27:49 - 27:54)
I have unite every two two and a half (27:52 - 27:56)
seconds so let's go (27:54 - 27:59)
um so they could definitely introduce (27:56 - 28:00)
that (27:59 - 28:03)
um and make it (28:00 - 28:05)
clear like they fixed the Edie problem (28:03 - 28:07)
so everybody knows what Eevee you're (28:05 - 28:08)
dealing with (28:07 - 28:10)
um I think they could do it but I think (28:08 - 28:12)
they need to be very thoughtful about (28:10 - 28:15)
how they do it given the long time it (28:12 - 28:18)
takes for a Charizard to become a (28:15 - 28:21)
Charizard especially if that player is (28:18 - 28:23)
bad and just keeps going to Lane and (28:21 - 28:26)
running in and dying like there's (28:23 - 28:27)
nothing more frustrating than having a (28:26 - 28:29)
shower mealing it at Rayquaza and you're (28:27 - 28:31)
like what are you what what have you (28:29 - 28:33)
been doing this entire game I'm an elder (28:31 - 28:36)
god said I'm a level 12. I'm like what (28:33 - 28:40)
is I'm sorry Pokemon is Charmeleon (28:36 - 28:40)
Bob what do you think (28:41 - 28:46)
I I like when the game is trying to (28:43 - 28:48)
bring in other types of mechanics into (28:46 - 28:50)
it so I think the way they did Mega (28:48 - 28:53)
Mewtwo X mega mewtwy was great um I (28:50 - 28:54)
agree I mean if you want to bring like a (28:53 - 28:56)
mega Charizard and you need to probably (28:54 - 28:58)
have a different license for it and it (28:56 - 29:00)
has to be built differently so it's a (28:58 - 29:02)
different (29:00 - 29:04)
um different Charizard build the levels (29:02 - 29:05)
will scale differently the stats will (29:04 - 29:06)
scale differently and then you can (29:05 - 29:08)
choose the path you want I mean I'm a (29:06 - 29:10)
big fan of how they do Scyther like you (29:08 - 29:12)
decide if you want to stay a Scyther or (29:10 - 29:14)
you can go into a scissor I know this (29:12 - 29:16)
I'm putting some other Pokemon that that (29:14 - 29:18)
could work with or there's some other (29:16 - 29:20)
Pokemon maybe like what if and you know (29:18 - 29:22)
this has been a talk for like months and (29:20 - 29:23)
months back before we got the mega (29:22 - 29:25)
Mewtwo's is you know what if it's a mega (29:23 - 29:26)
stone item in the game and you know what (29:25 - 29:28)
if some Pokemon can use a mega stone and (29:26 - 29:31)
go into a mega form [ __ ] a little bit so (29:28 - 29:32)
that could be another option if you have (29:31 - 29:34)
some Pokemon that you could just Mega (29:32 - 29:36)
Evolve like let's say you're playing as (29:34 - 29:37)
Gardevoir and maybe you want to make it (29:36 - 29:39)
into mega Gardevoir or you know five (29:37 - 29:41)
seconds ten seconds that may come down (29:39 - 29:44)
the line but other than that yeah I (29:41 - 29:45)
think yeah (29:44 - 29:48)
there are a lot of Pokemon in that game (29:45 - 29:50)
right now that can Mega there's Lucario (29:48 - 29:52)
there's Sableye there's Gardevoir (29:50 - 29:55)
there's Charizard like there's a lot of (29:52 - 29:59)
Mega possibilities in the game the thing (29:55 - 30:01)
is is that a lot of them also have (29:59 - 30:05)
things like gigantom X forms so like the (30:01 - 30:08)
question is is are they going to lean (30:05 - 30:11)
which one are they going to lean in when (30:08 - 30:13)
um because I could also see a gigantom x (30:11 - 30:15)
form Charizard thing happening where (30:13 - 30:17)
they change this unite to be a gigantom (30:15 - 30:20)
x and like how many the question is how (30:17 - 30:24)
many of the same Pokemon (30:20 - 30:27)
do you add to your game before it feels (30:24 - 30:30)
like this is really stale because (30:27 - 30:32)
technically look at Pokemon Masters they (30:30 - 30:37)
have four or five yeah I will argue that (30:32 - 30:39)
the difference about that is that you (30:37 - 30:40)
aren't paying attention to the Pokemon (30:39 - 30:42)
you're paying attention to the trainer (30:40 - 30:44)
like Pokemon Masters is a trainer game (30:42 - 30:47)
and everybody is focused on the trainer (30:44 - 30:50)
and doesn't really care so much about (30:47 - 30:52)
the Pokemon that they're with because (30:50 - 30:54)
Masters has done such a brilliant thing (30:52 - 30:56)
about making all of those characters (30:54 - 30:59)
rememberable they have incredible story (30:56 - 31:02)
lines they have personalities that you (30:59 - 31:05)
haven't said the fact that Cyrus refuses (31:02 - 31:07)
to destroy the universe because he (31:05 - 31:08)
doesn't want to lose his weird (31:07 - 31:10)
friendship with Sophocles which is like (31:08 - 31:12)
the weirdest (31:10 - 31:14)
timeline that we're in but it works (31:12 - 31:16)
really well in that game and you're like (31:14 - 31:18)
oh (31:16 - 31:21)
Cyrus finally has a friend it's a weird (31:18 - 31:25)
bad friend but he's got one I guess (31:21 - 31:26)
um that you knew what they were doing (31:25 - 31:29)
yeah it bastard's works well that it (31:26 - 31:31)
doesn't matter like this is our 14th (31:29 - 31:35)
Charizard because we care about who that (31:31 - 31:37)
Charizard is with like there's two (31:35 - 31:40)
ho-hos and and you're like both of them (31:37 - 31:42)
feel different because one is with (31:40 - 31:44)
silver and one is with Morty and their (31:42 - 31:47)
storylines are completely different and (31:44 - 31:48)
you have a different relationship with (31:47 - 31:51)
them that doesn't happen in the night (31:48 - 31:52)
like you could care less about your (31:51 - 31:54)
trainer and unite you rarely see them (31:52 - 31:57)
you see them on the splash page and (31:54 - 31:59)
that's it you are focused on your (31:57 - 32:02)
Pokemon and what that means to you and I (31:59 - 32:05)
think if they add seven Charizards that (32:02 - 32:08)
is they really need to be very careful (32:05 - 32:11)
about that and understand that Their (32:08 - 32:13)
audience is identifying with a specific (32:11 - 32:16)
Charizard so if one becomes really bad (32:13 - 32:18)
you're making a bunch of those players (32:16 - 32:20)
that love that Pokemon feel (32:18 - 32:25)
like they're not supported in their game (32:20 - 32:25)
okay I just didn't want to talk over (32:29 - 32:35)
anyone because I'm in this way I'm weird (32:31 - 32:38)
for those not watching the YouTube (32:35 - 32:40)
version I'm just I'm in a very Japanese (32:38 - 32:42)
hotel right now you're in a closet (32:40 - 32:44)
you're in a Japanese closet inside this (32:42 - 32:48)
strange Back Alley Bar I love it (32:44 - 32:50)
I mean I feel like I should go down and (32:48 - 32:51)
get our Japanese (32:50 - 32:53)
uh (32:51 - 32:55)
practitioner and put it up behind me so (32:53 - 32:58)
that I feel like (32:55 - 32:58)
look at that beautiful lovely closet (33:01 - 33:06)
these are the storage room it's a (33:04 - 33:07)
restaurant (33:06 - 33:09)
let me in I gotta record (33:07 - 33:12)

we're gonna take a break when we come (33:17 - 33:23)
back uh TCG news (33:20 - 33:25)
um some other news that I can't think of (33:23 - 33:26)
right now (33:25 - 33:29)
let's get through it all we will be (33:26 - 33:31)
right back (33:29 - 33:35)
and we are back from our break all right (33:31 - 33:37)
let's get the let's get the (33:35 - 33:40)
mouth-watering news out of the way here (33:37 - 33:41)
um (33:40 - 33:45)
tinkerton is coming to Pokemon cafe mix (33:41 - 33:50)
yeah yeah Cafe remix remix I still don't (33:45 - 33:51)
play that game (33:50 - 33:54)
and this was the question Greg does (33:51 - 33:57)
tinkerton coming to this game make you (33:54 - 33:59)
want to play it no (33:57 - 34:01)
no I don't like the gameplay so I was (33:59 - 34:05)
like no I don't it's fine but I don't (34:01 - 34:08)
enjoy that gameplay style like I've I (34:05 - 34:09)
tried it for a couple of weeks and I'm (34:08 - 34:11)
like you know what (34:09 - 34:12)
I don't (34:11 - 34:14)
find enjoyment (34:12 - 34:16)
in this and (34:14 - 34:20)
while Pokemon will carry me across many (34:16 - 34:23)
Finish Lines it is not doing enough work (34:20 - 34:26)
for Cafe remix (34:23 - 34:26)
Bob how much money have you spent on (34:26 - 34:30)
Cafe remix (34:29 - 34:35)
uh zero dollars because (34:30 - 34:37)
listen I (34:35 - 34:37)
understand I know I know Steve knows (34:38 - 34:42)
that like I love mimikyu a lot oh you (34:40 - 34:44)
and I'm excited for your night in what a (34:42 - 34:45)
month (34:44 - 34:47)
oh yeah that that could be in a few (34:45 - 34:49)
weeks you can talk about that too but (34:47 - 34:53)
even even mimikyu in Cafe remix I just (34:49 - 34:56)
can't get maybe I'm just not I went (34:53 - 34:58)
through my Bejeweled era back when I was (34:56 - 35:01)
in high school I mean it's like we all (34:58 - 35:05)
didn't we didn't we all do that so that (35:01 - 35:08)
type of game just doesn't really (35:05 - 35:10)
click with me yes it's beautiful looking (35:08 - 35:13)
I think it's very sweet (35:10 - 35:15)
um I'm glad the game is still having (35:13 - 35:18)
updates come out those who enjoy it but (35:15 - 35:22)
it's just not my not my cup of tea that (35:18 - 35:24)
you get it's not even this happened (35:22 - 35:26)
Bejeweled it's just weird it's weird (35:24 - 35:30)
circle draggy like yeah it's not quite (35:26 - 35:32)
Bejeweled yeah I mean like yeah true (35:30 - 35:33)
like yeah you have a grid and you have (35:32 - 35:35)
to like you know put connections (35:33 - 35:38)
together they're a great Bejeweled type (35:35 - 35:40)
Pokemon games (35:38 - 35:43)
but (35:40 - 35:44)
true okay that's fair (35:43 - 35:47)
and this isn't it (35:44 - 35:50)
um again like it (35:47 - 35:56)
the game is beautiful the game is (35:50 - 35:59)
like the art style is super super super (35:56 - 36:03)
Charming right like the thing is is I (35:59 - 36:06)
like much like sleeps art style is super (36:03 - 36:08)
charming and that sort of just keeps me (36:06 - 36:10)
checking in on it sort of passively like (36:08 - 36:11)
oh go ahead and look and see what (36:10 - 36:13)
happened to whatever (36:11 - 36:18)
um Cafe remix gameplay just does not (36:13 - 36:18)
is not carrot carry it it just isn't it (36:20 - 36:25)
it's just not fun for me enough for me (36:23 - 36:27)
to be like all if I could just go in and (36:25 - 36:29)
actually do like a Diner Dash thing (36:27 - 36:32)
where I'm having them make dishes like (36:29 - 36:34)
I'm having to click around to having to (36:32 - 36:36)
put together dishes (36:34 - 36:39)
yeah like with that art style I would (36:36 - 36:41)
probably play that game every day but (36:39 - 36:43)
the Way Cafe remix is with the weird (36:41 - 36:47)
loopies it's just it doesn't I don't (36:43 - 36:51)
enjoy that gameplay so I don't play it (36:47 - 36:53)
it's interesting out of (36:51 - 36:55)
all of the (36:53 - 36:59)
mobile games that obviously isn't like (36:55 - 37:02)
Pokemon go or Pokemon Masters that Cafe (36:59 - 37:06)
mix has survived (37:02 - 37:07)
like (37:06 - 37:10)
you look at Pokemon duel you look at (37:07 - 37:12)
Pokemon Rumble Rush (37:10 - 37:16)
um trose a shuffle Shuffle had a pretty (37:12 - 37:19)
good run (37:16 - 37:20)
um (37:19 - 37:23)
and I don't know that there was that (37:20 - 37:25)
weird thing where like shuffles on 3DS (37:23 - 37:27)
and they moved it to mobile and I felt (37:25 - 37:28)
like (37:27 - 37:30)
I would rather play on mobile but I was (37:28 - 37:36)
way too far in 3DS yeah (37:30 - 37:37)
um (37:36 - 37:38)
but (37:37 - 37:42)
I I don't know I I guess I would be (37:38 - 37:45)
I'm I guess I'm surprised that Cafe (37:42 - 37:49)
remix is still here I would be more (37:45 - 37:52)
surprised if in like a year we're still (37:49 - 37:55)
talking about Cafe remix (37:52 - 37:55)
I mean it isn't (37:56 - 38:01)
an entry point game that is fast on (37:58 - 38:03)
mobile and I think (38:01 - 38:06)
that (38:03 - 38:09)
it helps keep it alive (38:06 - 38:12)
um yeah I don't know the longest (38:09 - 38:16)
it will go but (38:12 - 38:16)
I mean I think it has legs I mean I (38:17 - 38:20)
think it has (38:19 - 38:25)
at least a few years of stuff for for it (38:20 - 38:27)
and as long as the thing is to think as (38:25 - 38:29)
long as the artwork stays This Charming (38:27 - 38:31)
people are going to want to play that (38:29 - 38:32)
game (38:31 - 38:36)
I I do think the art style lifts that (38:32 - 38:39)
game a lot for people where they're like (38:36 - 38:43)
yeah I love it it's so cute whereas I (38:39 - 38:45)
don't necessarily ever got that oh it's (38:43 - 38:47)
so cute feel from (38:45 - 38:49)
shovel (38:47 - 38:49)
like you're building a cafe like Shuffle (38:49 - 38:53)
was just like you go into the next stage (38:51 - 38:55)
and remix you're like building a cafe (38:53 - 38:56)
and there's little things that come and (38:55 - 38:58)
visit you're making cute things and it's (38:56 - 39:00)
like oh I'm getting a slice of life and (38:58 - 39:03)
that's way more of appealing theme than (39:00 - 39:06)
a lot of other games have (39:03 - 39:08)
yeah but I think that's like the (39:06 - 39:10)
disconnect to me because like (39:08 - 39:12)
I mean Bob Bob was like we all went (39:10 - 39:14)
through our Bejeweled face which is like (39:12 - 39:15)
a hundred percent true like literally (39:14 - 39:17)
everyone listening to this podcast had (39:15 - 39:21)
like a Bejeweled face and Shuffle was (39:17 - 39:25)
the closest to that (39:21 - 39:29)
and there are still people to this day (39:25 - 39:31)
playing Candy Crush there's no doubt (39:29 - 39:34)
that Candy Crush is like for as many (39:31 - 39:36)
people that are like Pokemon goes people (39:34 - 39:38)
still play Pokemon go I thought I (39:36 - 39:39)
thought Pokemon go was dead I'm sure (39:38 - 39:41)
that is the the same conversation (39:39 - 39:43)
happened in Candy Crush people like (39:41 - 39:45)
don't worry (39:43 - 39:46)
plenty of people are still playing Candy (39:45 - 39:51)
Crush and I've accepted that that's not (39:46 - 39:51)
me (39:51 - 39:54)
I'm not in that market I don't plan on (39:51 - 39:56)
being in that market my Bejeweled phase (39:54 - 40:00)
has left me but I'm curious of (39:56 - 40:04)
how often candy crush's onboarding new (40:00 - 40:05)
people (40:04 - 40:08)
and what that looks like through ads or (40:05 - 40:11)
through whatever in-game tactics they (40:08 - 40:13)
have to be like recommend a friend or (40:11 - 40:17)
welcome back or here's a new thing (40:13 - 40:19)
um (40:17 - 40:21)
because whatever Candy Crush is doing (40:19 - 40:25)
I'm sure Cafe mix is not doing it to (40:21 - 40:27)
that level (40:25 - 40:29)
um who owns Candy Crush like the people (40:27 - 40:31)
who own (40:29 - 40:34)
Clash of Clans or something yeah is it (40:31 - 40:36)
King I believe yeah here's the biggest (40:34 - 40:38)
king I think it's King (40:36 - 40:40)
here's a funny fact and this is a random (40:38 - 40:42)
side because probably I'm the only one (40:40 - 40:43)
who might notice because of the game (40:42 - 40:46)
yeah it's Kingdom it was a there was a (40:43 - 40:48)
Candy Crush game show at one point it (40:46 - 40:50)
was a legit game as it was there was (40:48 - 40:54)
there was on CBS I thought it was it was (40:50 - 40:58)
hot trash it was hosted by Mario Lopez I (40:54 - 41:00)
it's like I'm not saying we need a (40:58 - 41:02)
Pokemon cafe remix game show but I'm (41:00 - 41:05)
saying we do I mean we could listen we (41:02 - 41:07)
could we could be host of it um but no (41:05 - 41:08)
Steve makes a good point because it's (41:07 - 41:11)
like what's Candy Crush doing doing to (41:08 - 41:13)
maintain his popularity it had a game (41:11 - 41:15)
show it's doing something right to still (41:13 - 41:16)
Captivate (41:15 - 41:18)
um their loyal audience I don't know if (41:16 - 41:20)
they're acquiring new users a lot but (41:18 - 41:22)
there's some dedicated folks out there (41:20 - 41:24)
who are still using it and I think with (41:22 - 41:26)
with Cafe remix it's been up about three (41:24 - 41:28)
years now you know I wouldn't be (41:26 - 41:30)
surprised like like you said Steve if (41:28 - 41:32)
it's here for a year I know it's on it's (41:30 - 41:35)
on switch and it's on mobile so you have (41:32 - 41:37)
two audiences uh playing that game I (41:35 - 41:39)
don't know you know will they continue (41:37 - 41:41)
one or the other where they cancel it (41:39 - 41:43)
both if it comes that time again I don't (41:41 - 41:45)
know but I feel like (41:43 - 41:47)
you know Pokemon's Pokemon they'll find (41:45 - 41:49)
ways to keep that game a live impression (41:47 - 41:51)
putting new things into it I just don't (41:49 - 41:53)
know what else it can do to bring in any (41:51 - 41:54)
new players unless you're already (41:53 - 41:58)
invested in um yeah I mean I think the (41:54 - 42:02)
like Candy Crush exists in the (41:58 - 42:05)
background of everything we do like I (42:02 - 42:09)
think we're so used to Candy Crush ads (42:05 - 42:11)
that we don't even pay attention to them (42:09 - 42:13)
anymore and they're just there like (42:11 - 42:15)
every once in a while there's just (42:13 - 42:16)
something that comes up that's like hey (42:15 - 42:18)
but I also think they have been around (42:16 - 42:21)
so long and know their target audience (42:18 - 42:24)
and it's not us that we just we rarely (42:21 - 42:27)
see them but like I have a friend who (42:24 - 42:29)
plays Candy Crush every day has been (42:27 - 42:33)
playing Candy Crush every day for (42:29 - 42:35)
five years now (42:33 - 42:37)
and it's just like I jump in it's the (42:35 - 42:40)
game I play I jump in I do a level if I (42:37 - 42:41)
can't get past it I walk away for a bit (42:40 - 42:43)
and then I'll come back and try it and (42:41 - 42:45)
it feels so great when I get past that (42:43 - 42:46)
level (42:45 - 42:49)
and she's like at level (42:46 - 42:52)
2000 something I don't even know yeah (42:49 - 42:54)
that sounds right I don't even know and (42:52 - 42:56)
like well that's why I asked about like (42:54 - 42:58)
onboarding new users because you would (42:56 - 43:00)
think as a Pokemon game one of the ways (42:58 - 43:02)
you onboard (43:00 - 43:04)
somebody new is bringing their favorite (43:02 - 43:07)
Pokemon we literally just talked about (43:04 - 43:09)
that with unite like so many people came (43:07 - 43:11)
back because of Mewtwo and so if like (43:09 - 43:14)
tinkerton one of Greg's favorite Pokemon (43:11 - 43:17)
as I read Greg's threads were top 10 (43:14 - 43:20)
favorite Pokemon tinkerton was on there (43:17 - 43:21)
um (43:20 - 43:23)
if if your favorite Pokemon isn't (43:21 - 43:26)
bringing you to the game (43:23 - 43:28)
I don't know what else yeah I mean I (43:26 - 43:32)
think I think remix (43:28 - 43:32)
I think if you like that style of game (43:32 - 43:38)
or you've not tried it before your (43:35 - 43:40)
favorite Pokemon will get you to pick it (43:38 - 43:43)
up and try it I think the difference for (43:40 - 43:46)
me is I played the game I didn't enjoy (43:43 - 43:48)
it and knowing that my favorite Pokemon (43:46 - 43:50)
is going to be there (43:48 - 43:53)
doesn't stop me from not having enjoyed (43:50 - 43:54)
playing the game (43:53 - 43:56)
because I did play it it's just like (43:54 - 43:59)
okay my favorite Pokemon's there but I (43:56 - 44:02)
still don't like the game (43:59 - 44:03)
yeah I got the level seven before I fell (44:02 - 44:06)
off is because it was horizontal if it (44:03 - 44:08)
was vertical I'd be back in I can't have (44:06 - 44:11)
this conversation with you it makes so (44:08 - 44:14)
little sense (44:11 - 44:18)
if you're watching on YouTube comment (44:14 - 44:21)
horizontal or vertical (44:18 - 44:23)
fathers you in mobile games because I (44:21 - 44:25)
won't play a mobile game if it's (44:23 - 44:27)
horizontal it has to be vertical it's (44:25 - 44:30)
such it's such (44:27 - 44:33)
you can also comment on Slack or Discord (44:30 - 44:36)
I don't know (44:33 - 44:36)
uh I can't okay shifting gears to (44:37 - 44:43)
scarlet and violet there is a Blissey (44:40 - 44:45)
hattering Grim snarl light up five star (44:43 - 44:47)
Raid event (44:45 - 44:50)
um Mewtwo is coming to Seven Star raids (44:47 - 44:55)
that is August 31st I think it debuts (44:50 - 44:55)
um (44:55 - 44:58)
the day after good sleep day you got to (44:55 - 45:00)
get the good sleep (44:58 - 45:03)
good sleep (45:00 - 45:05)
uh this event is running from Thursday (45:03 - 45:08)
August 17th through the 31st (45:05 - 45:11)
and they're saying Mewtwo is a (45:08 - 45:13)
formidable foe it will have the (45:11 - 45:15)
mightiest Mark uh (45:13 - 45:18)
get ready to protect your allies with oh (45:15 - 45:20)
they're saying (45:18 - 45:23)
that these three Pokemon would be good (45:20 - 45:25)
supports (45:23 - 45:28)
for the Mewtwo so you have Blissey (45:25 - 45:32)
hatterine and Grim snarl uh (45:28 - 45:35)
which makes me (45:32 - 45:37)
maybe believe that Mewtwo won't have (45:35 - 45:39)
brick break I mean me too is a special (45:37 - 45:41)
attacker anyway so at having break would (45:39 - 45:43)
just be (45:41 - 45:46)
to mess with us (45:43 - 45:46)
but we're gonna assume at this point (45:46 - 45:52)
that Mewtwo won't have Brick Break (45:49 - 45:54)
um because they're saying here in the (45:52 - 45:56)
article light screen helping hand are (45:54 - 45:58)
good to use (45:56 - 45:58)
uh (45:59 - 46:04)
more importantly the Grim spiral and the (46:00 - 46:06)
hattering raids even if you don't need (46:04 - 46:09)
them for your team they will be dropping (46:06 - 46:12)
more vitamins and the Blissey will be (46:09 - 46:16)
dropping more tarot shards so if you got (46:12 - 46:18)
your free Mew which you have till like (46:16 - 46:20)
September to do you have plenty of time (46:18 - 46:21)
to get your free Mew it will have a (46:20 - 46:24)
random Terror type if it's bad you can (46:21 - 46:27)
change it I will be doing raid builds (46:24 - 46:29)
for Mew probably like three different (46:27 - 46:32)
Mew builds like an attacking Mew a (46:29 - 46:35)
supporting Mew and uh I don't know like (46:32 - 46:38)
an in-between like a (46:35 - 46:40)
a little of both because people have (46:38 - 46:42)
different Lifestyles uh sleeper one (46:40 - 46:45)
might say (46:42 - 46:45)
like there are some people that just (46:45 - 46:49)
love playing support and raids there are (46:47 - 46:51)
some people that just like hitting the (46:49 - 46:55)
big attack button so (46:51 - 46:57)
um I have a I have a dark Mew that's (46:55 - 46:58)
just gonna carry me I'm gonna leave it (46:57 - 47:00)
at level five and just see what happens (46:58 - 47:04)
perfect great (47:00 - 47:04)
while you were shopping in Japan I was (47:05 - 47:11)
doing blissy raids on my switch (47:07 - 47:12)
oh yeah where they're dropping good (47:11 - 47:15)
where the drops good they're fine (47:12 - 47:17)
um I mean it's just Senator shards I did (47:15 - 47:18)
a couple grim star on a couple of (47:17 - 47:21)
hatteren that had decent ones I'm like (47:18 - 47:23)
these aren't these just take too long so (47:21 - 47:26)
I'm just gonna do policy race (47:23 - 47:26)
the other ones just took too long and (47:26 - 47:33)
I'm like I don't want to be here forever (47:28 - 47:33)
I don't (47:33 - 47:38)
see why hatterine or Blissey or Grim (47:34 - 47:40)
snarl they all seem fine they all seem (47:38 - 47:42)
that would be fine against me too I just (47:40 - 47:45)
if you're getting a free Mew (47:42 - 47:48)
like Muse stats are supposed to be (47:45 - 47:50)
boosted against Mewtwo Mew can learn (47:48 - 47:52)
pretty much every single one of these (47:50 - 47:58)
moves I mean both both uh (47:52 - 48:00)
Brave battles they they both had Arena (47:58 - 48:02)
and Grims are all used their screens to (48:00 - 48:06)
be like hey these Pokemon have screens (48:02 - 48:08)
like (48:06 - 48:10)
wink wink (48:08 - 48:11)
hey (48:10 - 48:14)
fight which is also why I was like oh (48:11 - 48:15)
these take so long because they put (48:14 - 48:17)
their stupid screens up but I don't want (48:15 - 48:19)
to be here all night with these randos (48:17 - 48:21)
I'm just gonna do blizzard raids because (48:19 - 48:23)
while blissy (48:21 - 48:24)
can sometimes (48:23 - 48:27)
to heal people or do heal itself like it (48:24 - 48:31)
doesn't put up screens so (48:27 - 48:31)
I'll get through this really fast (48:31 - 48:37)
I have been working on this Goliath of a (48:34 - 48:42)
YouTube video of doing a 106 star raids (48:37 - 48:45)
not seven star because those are usually (48:42 - 48:47)
more prepared for (48:45 - 48:50)
106 star random raids (48:47 - 48:53)
and I'm documenting every Pokemon people (48:50 - 48:56)
bring their levels everything (48:53 - 48:59)
I'm like 30 out of 100. (48:56 - 49:02)
the craziest statistic I have from this (48:59 - 49:04)
is (49:02 - 49:07)
almost no one of these random people (49:04 - 49:10)
have held items that's the craziest (49:07 - 49:13)
statistic it's not like iron hands well (49:10 - 49:14)
there's a lot of iron hands it's like (49:13 - 49:18)
who's fainting the most who's it's it's (49:14 - 49:20)
who's bringing you like level 70 Pokemon (49:18 - 49:24)
to level 90 raid it is just no one has (49:20 - 49:28)
held items yeah like I (49:24 - 49:31)
forget because they aren't in my potty (49:28 - 49:33)
party they're in the Box (49:31 - 49:36)
and I when I'm in the Box I usually take (49:33 - 49:39)
things off to be like I might use them (49:36 - 49:41)
for something else and then I straight (49:39 - 49:43)
up promptly forget (49:41 - 49:45)
and I select the thing going into battle (49:43 - 49:46)
and I'm like (49:45 - 49:49)
oh I never put it well whatever (49:46 - 49:53)
I think whatever like I did I forgot it (49:49 - 49:55)
and I'm not I can't back out I can't go (49:53 - 49:59)
in and put it on right right right I (49:55 - 50:01)
spaced it because it's in my box and I (49:59 - 50:03)
don't keep items on them in my box (50:01 - 50:05)
because I have to move them around for (50:03 - 50:08)
seven star raids so I never think about (50:05 - 50:12)
it not even until I've hit confirm and (50:08 - 50:13)
I'm like (50:12 - 50:16)
oh right well whatever we're just gonna (50:13 - 50:18)
get through it because (50:16 - 50:20)
it's just gonna be the thing and I will (50:18 - 50:23)
I'm doing support anyways so (50:20 - 50:26)
uh but yeah so when I built that's not (50:23 - 50:28)
that surprising I think when you get (50:26 - 50:29)
into a raid and you have to pick (50:28 - 50:31)
something from your box you didn't put (50:29 - 50:32)
especially since the game's like do you (50:31 - 50:33)
want to put this in the Box yeah do you (50:32 - 50:35)
want to take the item off before you put (50:33 - 50:39)
it in the Box oh yeah put it in my bag (50:35 - 50:39)
I I think maybe this is a thing that I (50:41 - 50:45)
carried over for competitive but like (50:43 - 50:46)
when I'm building competitive Pokemon (50:45 - 50:50)
the the held item stays on that Pokemon (50:46 - 50:52)
and then so then when I started doing (50:50 - 50:55)
great builds it was like well I'm (50:52 - 50:58)
putting the show Bell on my samurai and (50:55 - 51:00)
I'm building a new Pokemon that needs (50:58 - 51:02)
shell Bell I'm gonna just buy a new (51:00 - 51:05)
shell Bell oh and so I've probably this (51:02 - 51:06)
is like the first Pokemon game where I (51:05 - 51:08)
think I've purchased like (51:06 - 51:10)
10 of every held item because I'm like (51:08 - 51:12)
well this Pokemon needs a shell Bell (51:10 - 51:14)
this needs a scope lens this one also (51:12 - 51:15)
needs a scope lens this one also needs (51:14 - 51:18)
to scope my brain is like oh I have one (51:15 - 51:21)
of those I don't need another (51:18 - 51:25)
oh once it's built it's it's in the box (51:21 - 51:27)
with everything it's very interesting as (51:25 - 51:30)
as the habits you develop from the (51:27 - 51:31)
different sides that you play in the (51:30 - 51:34)
game because I I never ever think about (51:31 - 51:36)
held items until it's too late (51:34 - 51:39)
yeah I mean like you know if you look at (51:36 - 51:42)
the normal Pokemon player you know (51:39 - 51:43)
they're probably not using all the items (51:42 - 51:45)
maybe they've never done competitive or (51:43 - 51:47)
maybe they don't know that even exists I (51:45 - 51:48)
think to your point Greg the more you (51:47 - 51:50)
play these games the more you realize oh (51:48 - 51:51)
yeah held items can actually make a (51:50 - 51:52)
difference and do make a difference in (51:51 - 51:55)
uh the statute of Pokemon so yeah I'm (51:52 - 51:57)
curious to know from this study you're (51:55 - 52:00)
doing Steve this this uh this very deep (51:57 - 52:02)
study (52:00 - 52:04)
it's also interesting I think because (52:02 - 52:07)
raids are so swingy if you have a good (52:04 - 52:10)
group the health items will make it go (52:07 - 52:12)
faster but you could probably get (52:10 - 52:14)
through it anyways and if you have a bad (52:12 - 52:16)
group of held item is not going to save (52:14 - 52:18)
you in any way shape or form oh yeah (52:16 - 52:20)
that's true if you have a level 60 Iron (52:18 - 52:22)
hands it doesn't matter if I have an (52:20 - 52:24)
assault vest on walk away (52:22 - 52:27)
the iron hands is dying the minute it (52:24 - 52:29)
hits the screen and we all know it so I (52:27 - 52:32)
think the game doesn't (52:29 - 52:37)
make Health items feel that (52:32 - 52:37)
important while they are I think the (52:38 - 52:43)
fact that when you're going with randoms (52:41 - 52:46)
your experience is such a pendulum that (52:43 - 52:48)
you're never sort of unless you're doing (52:46 - 52:50)
it with a core group of people you're (52:48 - 52:53)
never gonna get that feeling of this (52:50 - 52:54)
went so much better because I've had (52:53 - 52:57)
held items I've gone into seven star (52:54 - 53:00)
raids where I took the held item off (52:57 - 53:03)
forgot to put it back on and like well (53:00 - 53:04)
I'll have to remember to do it the next (53:03 - 53:06)
time but then I got my one and done and (53:04 - 53:08)
I'm like okay I'm I'm out and then I (53:06 - 53:11)
never did it (53:08 - 53:13)
well I mean like that's like (53:11 - 53:15)
yeah you're 100 right because like if (53:13 - 53:17)
you're if you're an annihilate player in (53:15 - 53:20)
a Solo raid you need like the shell Bell (53:17 - 53:22)
right but if you're an annihilate player (53:20 - 53:24)
in a group raid with a shell Bell (53:22 - 53:28)
doesn't matter if if little Timmy over (53:24 - 53:29)
here (53:28 - 53:31)
with his iron hands is fainting over and (53:29 - 53:33)
over again your shell Bell on your (53:31 - 53:35)
annihilate it's not gonna make a (53:33 - 53:38)
difference you're still gonna lose (53:35 - 53:38)
item almost love to see you one day (53:39 - 53:43)
almost like cow with unite you can see (53:42 - 53:47)
when your what players are picking (53:43 - 53:47)
if you you're doing a raid and you see (53:47 - 53:52)
like the cue and you see oh who's (53:50 - 53:53)
holding what and then that can maybe (53:52 - 53:56)
make a better decision making in those (53:53 - 53:57)
like two minutes or so if you need to (53:56 - 53:59)
add something yeah one thing I didn't (53:57 - 54:02)
like about level yeah actually you know (53:59 - 54:04)
what levels by themselves would be great (54:02 - 54:06)
I will say you know one thing I didn't (54:04 - 54:08)
miss from even on sword and shield when (54:06 - 54:10)
like you were doing those um Dynamics (54:08 - 54:11)
Adventures yeah they have moments where (54:10 - 54:13)
you come across the backpacking you have (54:11 - 54:14)
to pick a held item and you found out (54:13 - 54:16)
how incredibly useful that is so you (54:14 - 54:19)
know I just do play a big big role in (54:16 - 54:20)
these and I think the more information (54:19 - 54:23)
we can give players and you like what (54:20 - 54:25)
the team uh comprised of your levels or (54:23 - 54:27)
items I think you make you can make (54:25 - 54:29)
better decisions up front and have more (54:27 - 54:33)
successful raids as you go in (54:29 - 54:33)
uh speaking of Pokemon stuff happening (54:40 - 54:45)
very soon well sooner than Mewtwo coming (54:43 - 54:47)
to (54:45 - 54:49)
scarlet and violet jeez I almost said (54:47 - 54:51)

that it's not the five dollar ticket (55:27 - 55:32)
that was (55:29 - 55:34)
three years ago I don't remember it was (55:32 - 55:38)
whatever year Google Play sponsored the (55:34 - 55:41)
event uh it was the fifth year five year (55:38 - 55:43)
anniversary because it was five year (55:41 - 55:46)
anniversary five dollars Google Play was (55:43 - 55:48)
the sponsor they haven't had a big (55:46 - 55:51)
sponsor since who knows why (55:48 - 55:53)
maybe they're not selling enough of our (55:51 - 55:56)
data to the right companies to get a big (55:53 - 55:58)
enough sponsor I don't know (55:56 - 56:02)
but wasn't last year it was (55:58 - 56:05)
no that was the Hoenn tour it was free (56:02 - 56:07)
instead of charging us but then everyone (56:05 - 56:09)
was like it was bad but it was like it (56:07 - 56:11)

to get this Pikachu two hours for each (58:39 - 58:47)
Pikachu so who knows how easy or hard it (58:43 - 58:48)
will to get this (58:47 - 58:51)
Pikachu or the shiny version if that's (58:48 - 58:53)
what you care about (58:51 - 58:55)

coming back that will be in the (58:55 - 58:58)
wilderness (58:57 - 59:00)
form (58:58 - 59:00)

League stuff one star raids (59:17 - 59:21)
all the Pikachu's wearing the crown plus (59:19 - 59:25)
Gumi I say this every year (59:21 - 59:28)

gonna complain that they worked so hard (59:45 - 59:50)
to get their shiny Goomy and now they're (59:47 - 59:53)
just handing it out for Community today (59:50 - 59:55)
like (59:53 - 59:56)
whatever (59:55 - 59:59)
you've spent your money and complain I (59:56 - 60:01)
don't know it's what I do on this show (59:59 - 60:05)
so feel free don't fall for it (60:01 - 60:07)
two star raids will have carbank the (60:05 - 60:09)
only people who care about that are (60:07 - 60:11)
people who care about GBL because (60:09 - 60:13)
carbink's really good there three star (60:11 - 60:15)
raids will have a Snorlax wearing cowboy (60:13 - 60:18)
hat Primal raids will be Kyogre and (60:15 - 60:20)
Groudon (60:18 - 60:23)
and then of the the next day I think is (60:20 - 60:27)
Rayquaza so Sensational Sunday (60:23 - 60:30)
there will not be rotating habitats but (60:27 - 60:34)
instead any Pokemon from Saturdays will (60:30 - 60:37)
appear in the wild they maybe Pikachu (60:34 - 60:40)
they said any Pokemon so maybe the (60:37 - 60:41)
Pikachu (60:40 - 60:45)
the true star will be mega Rayquaza it (60:41 - 60:48)
will make its debut on Sunday (60:45 - 60:50)
there will be meteorites it's a new item (60:48 - 60:52)
in Pokemon go that you'll get through (60:50 - 60:54)
special research giving rickways a (60:52 - 60:56)
meteorite will allow it to learn Dragon (60:54 - 60:59)
Ascent it needs Dragon Ascent to Mega (60:56 - 61:03)
Evolve but you also need mega energy as (60:59 - 61:05)
well (61:03 - 61:07)
so keep that in mind (61:05 - 61:11)
it will appear in raids on Sunday (61:07 - 61:13)
um oh in addition mega Rayquaza the same (61:11 - 61:15)
Pokemon that appear in raids on Saturday (61:13 - 61:18)
will also appear on Sunday (61:15 - 61:21)
if you bought a ticket (61:18 - 61:24)
which is 15 bucks (61:21 - 61:26)
um (61:24 - 61:26)
different unknowns will spawn (61:26 - 61:33)
off your incense so you have to buy a (61:30 - 61:36)
ticket but you also have to turn on an (61:33 - 61:39)
incense and then you will get different (61:36 - 61:40)
unknowns (61:39 - 61:43)
in the quartz to (61:40 - 61:45)
terrarium you will get his swing (61:43 - 61:48)
Growlithe in the pirate sansu will get (61:45 - 61:50)
pawniard in the wilderness you will get (61:48 - 61:52)
carnivine and then in the shores you (61:50 - 61:54)
will get Pachirisu (61:52 - 61:57)
off of your incense (61:54 - 62:00)
along with the unknown and then if you (61:57 - 62:02)
have a ticket you will get increased (62:00 - 62:04)
chance of shiny Pokemon (62:02 - 62:06)
six special trades plus your normal (62:04 - 62:10)
special trade I think so should be seven (62:06 - 62:13)
I could be wrong it's saying six but you (62:10 - 62:17)
get one free anyways uh you get nine (62:13 - 62:19)
free raid passes (62:17 - 62:21)
from spinning the (62:19 - 62:23)
photo discs and then you will get (62:21 - 62:26)
special 7K eggs so that's the event this (62:23 - 62:29)
weekend (62:26 - 62:29)
don't know if it's worth it that if (62:30 - 62:36)
you're a hardcore in Pokemon go I'm sure (62:34 - 62:38)
you've purchased it if you went to any (62:36 - 62:41)
of the go fests you're probably hardcore (62:38 - 62:44)
enough to buy this I feel like the (62:41 - 62:46)
biggest deciding factor if you're gonna (62:44 - 62:48)
buy this ticket is if one of your (62:46 - 62:51)
friends is like I'm doing this by this (62:48 - 62:54)
ticket play with me yeah (62:51 - 62:57)
I mean malachite Wilderness has shiny (62:54 - 62:59)
Rosalie in it so I'm I'm back on my (62:57 - 63:02)
shiny rose grind I don't have enough I (62:59 - 63:04)
need all of them I only have like 60 in (63:02 - 63:08)
home right now I need a thousand (63:04 - 63:08)
only 60. Greg where are we playing this (63:09 - 63:13)
weekend (63:12 - 63:15)
I have to hook the Ducks I have to go to (63:13 - 63:16)
the State Fair at some point this (63:15 - 63:18)
weekend (63:16 - 63:18)
um and you can't play there they took (63:18 - 63:21)
away all the stuff because they shut it (63:20 - 63:24)
off uh they should offering the state (63:21 - 63:27)
fairs so (63:24 - 63:27)
I don't know which day we're doing the (63:28 - 63:32)
fair I'm gonna try to push for Sunday (63:30 - 63:35)
so that we can do all day of the like (63:32 - 63:37)
switching thing on Saturday (63:35 - 63:40)
um and Sunday is just more of the raid (63:37 - 63:41)
stuff and I can join for that because (63:40 - 63:44)
I'm not that into that (63:41 - 63:46)
um (63:44 - 63:49)
but like (63:46 - 63:51)
I mean if you want to go where the (63:49 - 63:52)
people are (63:51 - 63:57)
Centennial Lakes is the the biggest spot (63:52 - 63:59)
if we want to go with a bunch of people (63:57 - 64:02)
um if we want to keep to a smaller crowd (63:59 - 64:03)
of people but has just as many stops (64:02 - 64:06)
then I would say the art park because (64:03 - 64:10)
they've added more stops this more art (64:06 - 64:13)
people added more stops (64:10 - 64:16)
uh to that but um (64:13 - 64:20)
both days are supposed to be (64:16 - 64:23)
warm in being it's going to be 77 and (64:20 - 64:27)
80. that sounds very cold to what I've (64:23 - 64:28)
been dealing with yeah I mean it's (64:27 - 64:30)
supposed to be temperate (64:28 - 64:31)
um also (64:30 - 64:33)
if we want to do the whole gold medal (64:31 - 64:35)
park downtown Minneapolis I just don't (64:33 - 64:39)
think gold medal park has as many (64:35 - 64:42)
stops per (64:39 - 64:45)
area as like Centennial Lakes or Silver (64:42 - 64:48)
Lake does yeah I don't think so (64:45 - 64:49)
um (64:48 - 64:51)
because I know you want to stream (64:49 - 64:53)
um I think Centennial Lakes is probably (64:51 - 64:56)
decent plus it has like a bunch of (64:53 - 64:57)
restaurants yeah it has a bunch of (64:56 - 64:59)
places to stop I mean if we're looking (64:57 - 65:02)
for where we're gonna spend all day (64:59 - 65:05)
that has more places to top that other (65:02 - 65:07)
than you know like Silver Lake Park has (65:05 - 65:11)
its Cafe and one central location but (65:07 - 65:14)
not a lot of food options it's like you (65:11 - 65:16)
can get their bad sandwiches and they're (65:14 - 65:18)
not bad they're fine (65:16 - 65:20)
um so yeah I would say like Centennial (65:18 - 65:22)
likes is probably (65:20 - 65:25)
the best choice (65:22 - 65:26)
um (65:25 - 65:29)
for the most people it's got good shade (65:26 - 65:31)
it's outside there's places to stop (65:29 - 65:34)
there's places to use the restroom (65:31 - 65:36)
there will be there will be a lot of (65:34 - 65:38)
people because all the people that go to (65:36 - 65:41)
Mall of America can easily get to that (65:38 - 65:42)
Park (65:41 - 65:45)
yeah and do (65:42 - 65:47)
Bob what does your uh (65:45 - 65:49)
go Fest looking like are you skipping (65:47 - 65:51)
you playing you paying the fifteen (65:49 - 65:52)
dollars (65:51 - 65:54)

because I mean come on if you were gonna (65:54 - 66:01)
deny paying that after what you told us (65:58 - 66:03)
at the start of this program I would fly (66:01 - 66:07)
to your home and shake you (66:03 - 66:09)

um but no I so I'm for those who know (66:54 - 66:58)
I'm I'm in like the Raleigh Durham North (66:56 - 67:00)
Carolina area so if anyone's listening (66:58 - 67:03)
here and they wanna uh you know meet up (67:00 - 67:05)
in Raleigh and North Durham over that (67:03 - 67:07)
weekend more than happy to we'll do some (67:05 - 67:08)
races I think it's good if you're gonna (67:07 - 67:10)
be with people (67:08 - 67:13)
do this so uh I'll probably play both (67:10 - 67:15)
days uh at least in Durham we have a (67:13 - 67:17)
mall that that's AC so we can go and uh (67:15 - 67:20)
walk around not be in the heat but um no (67:17 - 67:22)
I'm excited for this I you know I'm (67:20 - 67:24)
watching people from afar especially at (67:22 - 67:27)
the in IRL go Fest you know watching uh (67:24 - 67:29)
Steven Osaka and watching my friends (67:27 - 67:31)
this past weekend in New York you know (67:29 - 67:34)
it's it's definitely a cool experience I (67:31 - 67:35)
wish I could I could have gone to New (67:34 - 67:37)
York and be in person for those go Fest (67:35 - 67:39)
events but this is the closest I can get (67:37 - 67:42)
and I think for the value especially if (67:39 - 67:44)
you get to play with other people IRL I (67:42 - 67:46)
think it's worth it so yeah I'm looking (67:44 - 67:48)
forward to it and we'll see uh we'll see (67:46 - 67:50)
how it goes (67:48 - 67:50)
you'll see how rare those Pikachu (67:51 - 67:55)
actually are there (67:53 - 67:58)
[Laughter] (67:55 - 68:00)
yeah they gotta be super rare so I can (67:58 - 68:02)
they can appreciate and value more (68:00 - 68:05)
the rarer the better uh final bit of (68:02 - 68:08)
news here is uh scarlet and violet (68:05 - 68:13)
we'll have uh the Paradox riff uh that (68:08 - 68:20)
that is the newest TCG uh that launched (68:13 - 68:24)
180 cards (68:20 - 68:24)
um is that a lot (68:24 - 68:27)
a lot if it's I (68:27 - 68:32)
well (68:30 - 68:34)
when they say 180 they're not telling (68:32 - 68:39)
you how many Secret Rings right (68:34 - 68:39)
I would say under 200 is pretty okay (68:40 - 68:48)
um but who knows how many how many (68:45 - 68:51)
secret rares they'll slap into this (68:48 - 68:54)
they're saying 15 brand new Pokemon EX (68:51 - 68:58)
20 trainer cards dozens of Pokemon and (68:54 - 69:01)
trainer cards with special illustrations (68:58 - 69:03)
there will be new ancient and future (69:01 - 69:06)
Pokemon and then type shift Tara (69:03 - 69:11)
including a water type Garchomp EX (69:06 - 69:15)
this will come out on November 3rd (69:11 - 69:18)
in the united worldwide except for Japan (69:15 - 69:22)
because Japan gets cards way quicker (69:18 - 69:24)
uh but yeah that was what they showed (69:22 - 69:28)
during the presents which was the future (69:24 - 69:33)
and pass and then how a spec is coming (69:28 - 69:36)
back (69:33 - 69:36)
and uh that's on Pokemon Center (69:36 - 69:43)
.com (69:40 - 69:43)
ever introduced a new Pokemon in the TCG (69:44 - 69:54)
game like they did with Mel tan and go (69:48 - 69:54)
um (69:56 - 70:01)
I feel like Merrell might have been the (69:58 - 70:03)
closest hmm (70:01 - 70:06)
like was Merrell in I don't remember (70:03 - 70:09)
Merrell's in like the tropical island (70:06 - 70:12)
set wasn't it which was like (70:09 - 70:16)
before it was in the game (70:12 - 70:18)
I don't know if anyone remembers those (70:16 - 70:19)
tropical cards it was like (70:18 - 70:24)
Mew and Pikachu and Lapras and executor (70:19 - 70:29)
Psyduck there's like 12 of them (70:24 - 70:29)
I think Merrell was there (70:30 - 70:36)
but but the dawn fan was in like the (70:33 - 70:39)
movie before it was in the game too (70:36 - 70:43)
the Mewtwo first movie (70:39 - 70:43)
that's a good question (70:44 - 70:50)
Pokemon card before (70:46 - 70:52)
I'm just curious because I was thinking (70:50 - 70:54)
about it like when the thing is like (70:52 - 70:56)
we'll be introducing new ancient and (70:54 - 70:58)
future Pokemon it'd be interesting if (70:56 - 71:01)
they released one of the new paradoxes (70:58 - 71:04)
in the card set before it was released (71:01 - 71:06)
in like (71:04 - 71:09)
the DLCs but I I doubt I just wondering (71:06 - 71:12)
if it ever happened before I I'm not I (71:09 - 71:14)
don't remember that ever happening but I (71:12 - 71:17)
thought oh that would be interesting (71:14 - 71:17)
well I think (71:17 - 71:25)
we at least know the types for Entei and (71:20 - 71:30)
tarakian right because walking wake and (71:25 - 71:35)
roaring Roar wait what is what is long (71:30 - 71:37)
neck boy called uh (71:35 - 71:38)
[Music] (71:37 - 71:41)
uh roaring bad design (71:38 - 71:45)
um no it's a good design they're they're (71:41 - 71:47)
they fought the normal primary types (71:45 - 71:50)
right so suicune is water riko is (71:47 - 71:54)
electric and Tay's fire oh but then (71:50 - 71:58)
raging bolt yeah but they're both their (71:54 - 72:02)
second Tire diapes are Dragon so Entei (71:58 - 72:07)
in the third second DLC would be (72:02 - 72:11)
fire dragon and then (72:07 - 72:15)
steel is the primary type or not the (72:11 - 72:18)
prime the main typing for Verizon iron (72:15 - 72:20)
leaves and (72:18 - 72:23)
iron crown (72:20 - 72:25)
yeah (72:23 - 72:27)
so it's (72:25 - 72:29)
Steel (72:27 - 72:33)
wait steel grass and then track Anna's (72:29 - 72:35)
Rock no it's not steel grass is it is it (72:33 - 72:39)
isn't it psychic something (72:35 - 72:39)
it's grass psychic that's right (72:39 - 72:45)
grass psychic steel psychic is iron (72:42 - 72:47)
crown (72:45 - 72:50)
oh so then it would be Rock psychic Rock (72:47 - 72:53)
psychic yeah they dropped their fighting (72:50 - 72:55)
for a psychic (72:53 - 72:58)
Rock psychic don't we have that isn't (72:55 - 73:00)

those are the only two (73:44 - 73:48)
okay so we're getting our first rock (73:46 - 73:50)
psychic because those two Pokemon are (73:48 - 73:51)

the Sun and they have big signs being (74:19 - 74:25)
like no cards (74:21 - 74:25)
you want a deck box though we got plenty (74:27 - 74:33)
of those you want to play Matt (74:29 - 74:37)
you want damage counters (74:33 - 74:37)
um yeah it's uh it's like impossible to (74:38 - 74:44)
get cards here which is such that in (74:41 - 74:45)
itself I feel like is culture shock (74:44 - 74:48)
because like five years ago you could (74:45 - 74:51)
literally walk into like a 7-Eleven or a (74:48 - 74:52)
Family Mart or a Lawson's and they would (74:51 - 74:55)
just be on the Shelf like and a (74:52 - 74:57)
convenience store is like every other (74:55 - 74:59)
building (74:57 - 74:59)
um so yeah there's (75:01 - 75:06)
it's very hard to get cards right now so (75:03 - 75:07)
um (75:06 - 75:09)
whatever they're doing (75:07 - 75:11)
it's working here (75:09 - 75:13)
yeah (75:11 - 75:16)
they're they're killing it here oh uh (75:13 - 75:19)
small Side Story for Japan uh so the (75:16 - 75:22)
mega Tokyo location (75:19 - 75:26)
in Tokyo uh which is in (75:22 - 75:28)
I think I think the English name for it (75:26 - 75:32)
is like Sunny Sunnyside City or whatever (75:28 - 75:34)
anyways it's just a giant ball when I (75:32 - 75:37)
was there five years ago it was (75:34 - 75:39)
easily the worst Pokemon Center I've (75:37 - 75:42)
been to it was it was dirty (75:39 - 75:44)
they were out of stock a lot of stuff (75:42 - 75:48)
every other Pokemon Center was was just (75:44 - 75:50)
cleaner nicer newer (75:48 - 75:53)
had more stock I hated that Pokemon (75:50 - 75:55)
Center my and it was the Mega it was (75:53 - 75:58)
still called Mega Tokyo (75:55 - 76:00)
that's also where the like cult girl (75:58 - 76:04)
found me that's a whole other story but (76:00 - 76:04)
I was kind of dreading going back to it (76:04 - 76:08)
but the main reason I went back to it (76:07 - 76:13)
was because the Pokemon cafe (76:08 - 76:15)
which not to be confused with the (76:13 - 76:17)
Pokemon cafe that you sit down and this (76:15 - 76:21)
is like the Pokemon sweet drink Cafe so (76:17 - 76:23)
you can just get like a latte there they (76:21 - 76:26)
have like a latte they have like a fruit (76:23 - 76:29)
smoothie and then they have like waffles (76:26 - 76:30)
and that's kind of like their whole menu (76:29 - 76:33)
so you can't sit down you just go go in (76:30 - 76:36)
get a latte whatever till you're done so (76:33 - 76:38)
the latte place (76:36 - 76:41)
is near Mega Tokyo but in the five years (76:38 - 76:44)
they pretty much redid that whole store (76:41 - 76:48)
so it's actually like gorgeous it's it (76:44 - 76:51)
feels brand new looks brand new plenty (76:48 - 76:54)
of inventory but they also have a whole (76:51 - 76:57)
TCG area which they did before but the (76:54 - 77:00)
tastier is like more new so they have (76:57 - 77:03)
seats people were playing it was like a (77:00 - 77:05)
random like Wednesday night and it was (77:03 - 77:07)
like loaded with people I don't know (77:05 - 77:08)
maybe it was a league night but I don't (77:07 - 77:10)
think so and then they have like a whole (77:08 - 77:13)
Pokemon go area which (77:10 - 77:16)
you can just go there and like there's (77:13 - 77:18)
like a gym in the middle so if you take (77:16 - 77:20)
the gym your name will appear on the (77:18 - 77:21)
screen which is cool and it shows what (77:20 - 77:24)
Pokemon you put in it was impossible to (77:21 - 77:27)
take it because it was all like (77:24 - 77:30)
and I was like I tried and I was like oh (77:27 - 77:32)
no these people they're they're on it (77:30 - 77:35)
like they are they're like whoever put (77:32 - 77:37)
their Pokemon in they're watching them (77:35 - 77:39)
like a hawk so this is a waste of time (77:37 - 77:41)
but (77:39 - 77:43)
it's just it was just like a nice place (77:41 - 77:46)
to stand in there and like me being like (77:43 - 77:50)
the only white dude standing in here the (77:46 - 77:52)
Japanese people were like oh he probably (77:50 - 77:55)
has bufalant he's white he's not like us (77:52 - 77:57)
so it's cool (77:55 - 77:59)
to have like (77:57 - 78:03)
an area dedicated I don't know how busy (77:59 - 78:05)
or not busy that area ends up being (78:03 - 78:07)
probably on like a Saturday or Sunday (78:05 - 78:10)
it's it's slammed but (78:07 - 78:13)
it was just like a cool experience of (78:10 - 78:16)
here's a go area here's a TCG area (78:13 - 78:18)
here's a cafe (78:16 - 78:21)
and then here's the Pokemon Center (78:18 - 78:22)
um (78:21 - 78:24)
all in like this it was almost like (78:22 - 78:27)
Pokemon took over that entire floor (78:24 - 78:29)
whereas like when I was there five years (78:27 - 78:31)
ago there was like an Abercrombie and (78:29 - 78:34)
finch look like across like oh I think (78:31 - 78:36)
that's gone now it's just all Pokemon (78:34 - 78:38)
stuff (78:36 - 78:41)
um so (78:38 - 78:41)
still sold out of TCG cards but if you (78:41 - 78:46)
had cards and you had a deck you could (78:44 - 78:50)
sit down and play which would be cool uh (78:46 - 78:54)
but yeah it was it was um cool to see (78:50 - 78:55)
that like (78:54 - 78:58)
kind of revamped and (78:55 - 79:02)
now if somebody's coming to like Tokyo (78:58 - 79:05)
I'd be like oh yeah definitely go to the (79:02 - 79:08)
mega Tokyo and get a seven dollar (79:05 - 79:12)
Jirachi latte (79:08 - 79:12)
it's just (79:12 - 79:14)
a latte (79:12 - 79:15)
yeah (79:14 - 79:17)
full of wishes (79:15 - 79:20)

um hey huge shout out to everyone at the (80:18 - 80:25)
New York go Fest (80:23 - 80:29)
that yeah uh I know I I think Ace was (80:25 - 80:32)
the one that got the cardboard cutouts (80:29 - 80:36)
carried them to New York set them up it (80:32 - 80:40)
was so cool and flattering to see how (80:36 - 80:42)
our Discord community and our slack (80:40 - 80:45)
Community found each other and hung out (80:42 - 80:48)
and it sounded like they all hung out (80:45 - 80:50)
multiple times and they got lunch and (80:48 - 80:54)
they played go together and I'm trusting (80:50 - 80:56)
if anything went real good went wrong (80:54 - 80:58)
we're gonna blame Hannah because she was (80:56 - 81:01)
the only 100 Hannah's fault (80:58 - 81:07)
Hannah was in Hannah was in charge (81:01 - 81:07)
will implants go to complaints go to (81:09 - 81:14)
that inbox.com (81:11 - 81:14)
it was um (81:15 - 81:20)
it was just really great to see uh and (81:17 - 81:23)
uh so all the pictures everything coming (81:20 - 81:28)
out of New York go Fest was like (81:23 - 81:31)
I think for Greg and I not being there (81:28 - 81:34)
this was like (81:31 - 81:36)
probably better (81:34 - 81:41)
I mean I would I would have loved to (81:36 - 81:45)
have been there so much so just seeing (81:41 - 81:48)
the pictures and the wildness and the (81:45 - 81:50)
unbridled just (81:48 - 81:52)
goofiness of it all (81:50 - 81:55)
made sort of the sting of not being able (81:52 - 81:57)
to do that this year (81:55 - 82:00)
lessen a lot and it was Charming (81:57 - 82:02)
although y'all were doing that late at (82:00 - 82:03)
night so I did have to put my phone on (82:02 - 82:05)
silent to sleep because at some point (82:03 - 82:07)
I'm like I need to go to bed and you're (82:05 - 82:11)
hitting me up uh but (82:07 - 82:13)
everybody who came out and just took (82:11 - 82:16)
pictures and hauled us around (82:13 - 82:20)
it's like it means more than you (82:16 - 82:22)
probably know it was so wholesome to see (82:20 - 82:24)
that like I I just love when communities (82:22 - 82:26)
do that and just seeing those cutouts (82:24 - 82:27)
and just the group photos it it (82:26 - 82:30)
definitely was a highlight just to see (82:27 - 82:32)
that and having them just come together (82:30 - 82:35)
so that was that was super cool to see (82:32 - 82:38)
yeah I don't I don't know a lot of (82:35 - 82:40)
communities were (82:38 - 82:43)
the community members would go this (82:40 - 82:46)
length to make cardboard cutouts than to (82:43 - 82:49)
find each other than to continue to (82:46 - 82:51)
carry the cardboard cutouts around the (82:49 - 82:52)
park (82:51 - 82:55)
