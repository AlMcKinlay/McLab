uh let's let's just get in pokemon news (2:55 - 3:00)
uh the first bit of news here is (2:57 - 3:03)
blastoise (3:00 - 3:06)
is now available in pokemon unite this (3:03 - 3:08)
is off pokemon.com get ready to make a (3:06 - 3:10)
big splash in pokemon united as (3:08 - 3:12)
blastoise is now available to join your (3:10 - 3:14)
team this popular pokemon is a range (3:12 - 3:15)
defender (3:14 - 3:17)
uh and it will provide some useful (3:15 - 3:19)
support for your squad the pokemon will (3:17 - 3:21)
get begin the match as a squirtle evolve (3:19 - 3:23)
into a war total at five eight blastoise (3:21 - 3:25)
at level nine you can even make your (3:23 - 3:28)
blastoise look positively fancy with a (3:25 - 3:30)
fashionable style hollower (3:28 - 3:32)
blastoise basic attack will become a (3:30 - 3:34)
boosted attack with every third attack (3:32 - 3:36)
dealing continual damage and decreasing (3:34 - 3:38)
the movement speed of the pokemon for a (3:36 - 3:41)
short time blastoise ability torrent (3:38 - 3:43)
will cause its attack and special to (3:41 - 3:45)
attack to increase when the pokemon is (3:43 - 3:49)
at half hp or less that sounds very good (3:45 - 3:51)
um also it's one third in the games yes (3:49 - 3:54)
correct (3:51 - 3:58)
and then less than half technically (3:54 - 3:59)
still counts (3:58 - 4:01)
uh and then it talks about blastoise (3:59 - 4:05)
moves we don't have to go into (4:01 - 4:06)
here's the thing (4:05 - 4:08)
i i play (4:06 - 4:09)
there's a lot of character based games (4:08 - 4:14)
out there in the world overwatch uh apex (4:09 - 4:14)
final fantasy 14 destiny and final (4:16 - 4:20)
fantasy don't count because they're not (4:18 - 4:22)
introducing new characters well i guess (4:20 - 4:24)
final fantasy 14 is introducing like (4:22 - 4:26)
they introduce new classes there's new (4:24 - 4:29)
npcs all the time there's sometimes a (4:26 - 4:31)
new race like what are you talking about (4:29 - 4:33)
but apex and what was the first game i (4:31 - 4:36)
said oh overwatch dota league of legends (4:33 - 4:39)
they introduce characters (4:36 - 4:41)
and if they introdu the thought process (4:39 - 4:43)
is if they introduce (4:41 - 4:46)
a character that's not good then no one (4:43 - 4:50)
will buy it and they want to make money (4:46 - 4:52)
yeah it's character creep that's what (4:50 - 4:53)
happened yeah (4:52 - 4:55)
and so (4:53 - 4:57)
i know that this gets thrown around a (4:55 - 4:59)
lot (4:57 - 5:02)
but i'm gonna say that blastoise is op (4:59 - 5:04)
he's too good (5:02 - 5:06)
well that's the trick is they introduce (5:04 - 5:09)
blastoises op and then after people (5:06 - 5:12)
rising (5:09 - 5:12)
that is the that is the mmo way (5:13 - 5:17)
is it op or do people just not know how (5:17 - 5:22)
to deal with it yet so that one yeah (5:20 - 5:23)
that's what i wanted to talk about (5:22 - 5:26)
because people said zara oro was opie (5:23 - 5:28)
when zera aura came out and they did (5:26 - 5:31)
nerf zero aura zero zoro zera auras (5:28 - 5:33)
unite move that's the only thing they (5:31 - 5:34)
nerfed (5:33 - 5:36)
and i (5:34 - 5:39)
in the some however many games of unite (5:36 - 5:41)
i've played i've played a lot (5:39 - 5:44)
the first couple weeks i was like oh (5:41 - 5:45)
zara aura (5:44 - 5:46)
but (5:45 - 5:48)
unite move aside the thing that bothered (5:46 - 5:49)
me with zero aurora wasn't a unite move (5:48 - 5:53)
was its discharge (5:49 - 5:54)
but now i just know how to play against (5:53 - 5:56)
their aura (5:54 - 5:58)
you just like know that okay it's going (5:56 - 6:00)
to discharge okay it discharged i walked (5:58 - 6:02)
away from him so he can't discharge me (6:00 - 6:05)
and then you know that he has like (6:02 - 6:06)
whatever six seconds before he can do it (6:05 - 6:08)
again and that's when you get in close (6:06 - 6:12)
and yeah you mess him up wreck house so (6:08 - 6:14)
even though people screamed that zero (6:12 - 6:15)
oros op (6:14 - 6:17)
discharged specifically i don't think i (6:15 - 6:19)
like i i've never worry about playing (6:17 - 6:21)
against aurora i'm more worried about (6:19 - 6:23)
playing against like lucario lucario's (6:21 - 6:25)
super annoying well and that (6:23 - 6:27)
lucario is a hard counter to cramaran so (6:25 - 6:29)
that's part of my problem that's why you (6:27 - 6:32)
hate it so much (6:29 - 6:33)
um (6:32 - 6:36)
but blastoise is op specifically it's (6:33 - 6:39)
one move the shell (6:36 - 6:42)
spin rapid spin (6:39 - 6:45)
it lasts for it it lasts for eight (6:42 - 6:46)
seconds (6:45 - 6:48)
and you can't you can't do anything to (6:46 - 6:50)
him you can't put him to sleep you can't (6:48 - 6:52)
double slap him you can't (6:50 - 6:55)
hurricane him you can't he just spins (6:52 - 6:57)
what if i'm slow bro can i pick him up (6:55 - 6:59)
in the air nope he's unstoppable the (6:57 - 7:01)
entire time (6:59 - 7:03)
does he move or he's just one space no (7:01 - 7:05)
he he was (7:03 - 7:08)
bumper balling around the whole map (7:05 - 7:10)
it's incredibly good (7:08 - 7:11)
yeah but it's not targeted i mean it's (7:10 - 7:13)
only you can only target at the (7:11 - 7:15)
beginning so right if you don't aim (7:13 - 7:16)
right it's just going to bounce around (7:15 - 7:17)
and hit nobody (7:16 - 7:18)
i (7:17 - 7:20)
that i'm not sure i haven't (7:18 - 7:22)
i did play blastoise a little bit in the (7:20 - 7:24)
3v3 or whatever but i didn't pick rapid (7:22 - 7:26)
spin i picked whatever the other move (7:24 - 7:29)
was that's why you're tilted because you (7:26 - 7:31)
picked the wrong move (7:29 - 7:35)
blastoise too good (7:31 - 7:36)
um (7:35 - 7:39)
and his outfit's dumb can we talk it's (7:36 - 7:41)
it's a bad outfit why is it a bad outfit (7:39 - 7:44)
because he's like okay because pikachu (7:41 - 7:47)
has a similar outfit it's like dapper (7:44 - 7:49)
pikachu with the not the i don't know (7:47 - 7:51)
what kind of hat it's like the easter (7:49 - 7:52)
hat (7:51 - 7:54)
like a top hat (7:52 - 7:55)
or yeah like a top hat but not like (7:54 - 7:59)
abraham lincoln top hat like (7:55 - 8:02)
more like a bowler (7:59 - 8:02)
more like a southern top hat (8:02 - 8:06)
what is it southern top what do you like (8:04 - 8:08)
is it a kentucky fried chicken (8:06 - 8:12)
no it's it's a standard straw boater hat (8:08 - 8:14)
it's the wide brim (8:12 - 8:16)
white short top it's not a top hat it's (8:14 - 8:18)
a boater hat it's a straw boater hat and (8:16 - 8:21)
he's also wearing a vest he is a (8:18 - 8:23)
he is (8:21 - 8:24)
a (8:23 - 8:27)
dapper suited summer suited blastoise (8:24 - 8:29)
what's wrong with it (8:27 - 8:31)
they like (8:29 - 8:34)
gave him that weird flower button (8:31 - 8:37)
it looks bad like a boutonniere (8:34 - 8:39)
no he's like button but not as best as a (8:37 - 8:42)
flower instead of just a button yeah why (8:39 - 8:44)
is that right that green is a bad color (8:42 - 8:46)
it's a bad grain why is it a bad green (8:44 - 8:49)
it's not a good green what's a good (8:46 - 8:53)
green not that (8:49 - 8:53)
i bought blastocyst (8:55 - 8:59)
with my coins (8:57 - 9:01)
uh i don't like i don't he's fine i (8:59 - 9:04)
don't like playing him he's fine i like (9:01 - 9:06)
defenders you only like crammer you only (9:04 - 9:08)
like attackers um (9:06 - 9:10)
i like i think i like slow bro more as a (9:08 - 9:13)
defender (9:10 - 9:15)
i do like crammer and a lot i like the (9:13 - 9:17)
aoes (9:15 - 9:20)
[Laughter] (9:17 - 9:22)
yeah that's why i can't (9:20 - 9:24)
exactly yeah cinderella i have to aim (9:22 - 9:26)
and i'm always going to miss my aim and (9:24 - 9:28)
then i say you lose you just leave you (9:26 - 9:30)
just leave whirlwind traps around and (9:28 - 9:32)
hope somebody falls into them oh they (9:30 - 9:34)
always do greg they always do are we (9:32 - 9:36)
still playing unite well gave up on it (9:34 - 9:38)
right i didn't give up on it it's just (9:36 - 9:40)
none of my friends want to play with me (9:38 - 9:42)
anymore so i had to play by myself oh (9:40 - 9:44)
did the smash brother thing happen (9:42 - 9:46)
everyone got good and you didn't (9:44 - 9:49)
no everybody went back to dota and (9:46 - 9:51)
league (9:49 - 9:53)
they're like yeah that was a diversion (9:51 - 9:54)
now let's back go back to the real (9:53 - 9:57)
esports uh (9:54 - 9:58)
i haven't played in a week because i've (9:57 - 10:00)
been playing wildermuth which is a very (9:58 - 10:03)
good game what oh geez (10:00 - 10:06)
i will say this i (10:03 - 10:07)
within the first week of the game i got (10:06 - 10:10)
my three items that i use wise glasses (10:07 - 10:11)
shell bell (10:10 - 10:13)
buddy barrier literally it's every like (10:11 - 10:15)
pokemon we're not even gonna we're not (10:13 - 10:17)
gonna talk about pokemon.com put out an (10:15 - 10:20)
article of like held items on pokemon (10:17 - 10:21)
every single one has buddy barrier (10:20 - 10:24)
there's not a single pokemon on that (10:21 - 10:26)
list that doesn't have buddy barrier (10:24 - 10:27)
so like the first week of the game i got (10:26 - 10:29)
all my items up to 20. didn't pay any (10:27 - 10:31)
money just like grinded the tickets (10:29 - 10:33)
saved the tickets and it's helpful that (10:31 - 10:35)
i only play like one character right (10:33 - 10:36)
like if you're playing (10:35 - 10:37)
like three characters and you're like (10:36 - 10:39)
well well they all have buddy barrier (10:37 - 10:41)
but this one has focus band and this one (10:39 - 10:44)
has the shell bell and like that's what (10:41 - 10:47)
my problem is (10:44 - 10:50)
and i got all the way up to (10:47 - 10:53)
ultrarank with all my items at 20 (10:50 - 10:55)
and then i lost all to rank (10:53 - 10:57)
and then i was like you know what i have (10:55 - 11:02)
like 7 000 tickets because i'm a hoarder (10:57 - 11:05)
and i was like i'm gonna (11:02 - 11:08)
bring up my wise classes (11:05 - 11:10)
and there is this has already been (11:08 - 11:12)
proven on like youtube and (11:10 - 11:16)
whatnot there's a huge difference (11:12 - 11:17)
in your held items or not your held (11:16 - 11:19)
items yeah held items (11:17 - 11:20)
and (11:19 - 11:23)
when i went from 20 to 25 on wise (11:20 - 11:26)
glasses oh i was surfing all over the (11:23 - 11:30)
map yep i was destroying yep (11:26 - 11:32)
and it it's just like oh this is how so (11:30 - 11:35)
many people got to master ranks so fast (11:32 - 11:38)
like it actually it like (11:35 - 11:41)
actually like and i would i want to say (11:38 - 11:43)
it actually matters literally and (11:41 - 11:45)
figuratively because a lot of the times (11:43 - 11:47)
and i've (11:45 - 11:48)
i have all my matches recorded you can (11:47 - 11:51)
go to my twitch but (11:48 - 11:53)
a lot of the times you would see oh that (11:51 - 11:55)
pokemon had one hp left (11:53 - 11:59)
bummer if only i did one percent more (11:55 - 12:02)
damage and they died instead of me dying (11:59 - 12:06)
that's a whole sway in a match (12:02 - 12:08)
like if it if it's like two verse two (12:06 - 12:11)
and they kill you before you kill them (12:08 - 12:14)
now it's now your teammate is one verse (12:11 - 12:15)
two (12:14 - 12:17)
and then your teammate dies and they (12:15 - 12:19)
don't and they get the experience for (12:17 - 12:20)
killing you and they're still alive and (12:19 - 12:23)
they still have map area (12:20 - 12:25)
and so like when i was like uh for so (12:23 - 12:27)
many matches like ah they lived with one (12:25 - 12:29)
oh they lived with one oh that's a they (12:27 - 12:32)
lived with one hp and then i went up to (12:29 - 12:35)
25 instead of 20. (12:32 - 12:38)
now now i am the one (12:35 - 12:41)
living on one i told y'all like what (12:38 - 12:43)
three weeks ago that i hit the paywall (12:41 - 12:47)
while real hard where (12:43 - 12:47)
you it you cannot deny that that makes a (12:47 - 12:53)
huge difference like (12:50 - 12:56)
now you're 100 correct yes (12:53 - 12:58)
and i had it i had to step away because (12:56 - 13:00)
i was super frustrated for a bit i'm (12:58 - 13:01)
like i just need to like (13:00 - 13:04)
i just need to recalibrate my feelings (13:01 - 13:05)
about the game (13:04 - 13:08)
uh so i stepped away (13:05 - 13:11)
because of the pay to win aspect of it (13:08 - 13:12)
and i don't think there's a ton of (13:11 - 13:13)
people who are like oh it's just pay to (13:12 - 13:15)
advance like (13:13 - 13:17)
it's cutting hairs like you advance (13:15 - 13:19)
through winning i mean at a certain (13:17 - 13:20)
point like (13:19 - 13:21)
yeah i mean at like a certain point i (13:20 - 13:23)
guess if people continue to play this (13:21 - 13:25)
game and maybe if they only play one (13:23 - 13:28)
character yeah the like if you got to (13:25 - 13:29)
master rank (13:28 - 13:32)
this season which ends in like (13:29 - 13:34)
two weeks (13:32 - 13:38)
you will get 20 000 tickets and 20 000 (13:34 - 13:40)
tickets will take any item from zero to (13:38 - 13:42)
30 for free (13:40 - 13:45)
um (13:42 - 13:48)
and if you're if you've gotten like 300 (13:45 - 13:51)
or 400 games (13:48 - 13:53)
you could probably take one item to 30 (13:51 - 13:56)
for free (13:53 - 13:57)
but that's still after what this game (13:56 - 13:59)
came out in july (13:57 - 14:01)
yeah (13:59 - 14:01)
so that's (14:02 - 14:05)
still (14:04 - 14:08)
it's like still not three items to 30 (14:05 - 14:10)
for free it's like (14:08 - 14:13)
two and a half in a year in a year and (14:10 - 14:15)
then they'll introduce new items yep (14:13 - 14:18)
i really hope they get rid of th this (14:15 - 14:20)
aspect of the game but (14:18 - 14:22)
i don't think they will i mean league (14:20 - 14:25)
did eventually eventually league had the (14:22 - 14:28)
same system i mean it took them a while (14:25 - 14:28)
so (14:28 - 14:30)
i don't perceive this anytime in the (14:28 - 14:32)
future (14:30 - 14:34)
i'm just waiting for mamo swine like i'm (14:32 - 14:37)
i i want to try blastoise but like (14:34 - 14:38)
i'm waiting for mammoth i'm waiting for (14:37 - 14:40)
mama swine they already announced it i (14:38 - 14:42)
want it (14:40 - 14:43)
period (14:42 - 14:45)
there's also a like a glitch in the game (14:43 - 14:48)
right now like the last update and yeah (14:45 - 14:50)
there's like a something specifically (14:48 - 14:52)
with crustal and a jump pad and it's (14:50 - 14:54)
very (14:52 - 14:57)
i i don't know what it is (14:54 - 14:59)
crustal is too heavy for the doug trio (14:57 - 15:02)
to push yep (14:59 - 15:03)
yeah (15:02 - 15:05)
you have to sell smash so that you're (15:03 - 15:06)
lighter (15:05 - 15:08)
to use the dump head properly (15:06 - 15:09)
what you're doing anyways because you're (15:08 - 15:11)
jungle crystal and you're running around (15:09 - 15:13)
in jungle at top max speed because you (15:11 - 15:15)
sell smashed and you murder things that (15:13 - 15:17)
is why jungle crustal is the best (15:15 - 15:23)
crystal the yeah i don't know how like (15:17 - 15:25)
obviously the meta of unite has changed (15:23 - 15:27)
like the very first week of the game no (15:25 - 15:29)
one wanted to do dreadnought everyone (15:27 - 15:31)
ignored dreadnaught everyone was like (15:29 - 15:32)
dreadnought was a waste of time (15:31 - 15:34)
and then like two weeks in people were (15:32 - 15:35)
like (15:34 - 15:37)
row time is the waste of time stop doing (15:35 - 15:39)
like we all do dreadnought now and it's (15:37 - 15:42)
like to the point where (15:39 - 15:46)
the meta is who cares about top lane (15:42 - 15:48)
get dreadna (15:46 - 15:49)
yeah (15:48 - 15:50)
which is (15:49 - 15:52)
and now (15:50 - 15:53)
now and (15:52 - 15:55)
and the first couple weeks were also (15:53 - 15:59)
like oh zapdos is more important (15:55 - 15:59)
now i feel like no one even does that (16:00 - 16:04)
just now i feel like (16:01 - 16:06)
everyone's just so focused on (16:04 - 16:07)
dreadnought and then like there's this (16:06 - 16:09)
weird panic when zapdos comes and no one (16:07 - 16:11)
does it except (16:09 - 16:13)
the tough part is if you if your team (16:11 - 16:14)
can get two (16:13 - 16:16)
dreadnaughs (16:14 - 16:19)
you have such an xp level boost like you (16:16 - 16:21)
have such an advantage at that point (16:19 - 16:24)
it's really hard to like (16:21 - 16:24)
like it's really hard for the other team (16:25 - 16:29)
to catch up even with (16:27 - 16:32)
zapdos like it's not impossible (16:29 - 16:34)
but it is difficult like if you've lost (16:32 - 16:37)
both dreadnoughts and heaven forbid you (16:34 - 16:39)
lose a third (16:37 - 16:42)
like you just you aren't coming back (16:39 - 16:43)
from (16:42 - 16:47)
like that huge of a xp gap right (16:43 - 16:48)
and before somebody's like well that's (16:47 - 16:50)
when you have to go for zapdos and it's (16:48 - 16:51)
like (16:50 - 16:53)
yeah but they're they're all two levels (16:51 - 16:54)
above you and they're gonna be waiting (16:53 - 16:56)
at zapdos they'll be waiting at zapdos (16:54 - 16:58)
they'll come in and kill or they'll wait (16:56 - 16:59)
and they'll come in and wipe you out and (16:58 - 17:01)
snipe it like (16:59 - 17:03)
the level difference of getting two (17:01 - 17:04)
dreadnoughs (17:03 - 17:07)
is huge it's not impossible to overcome (17:04 - 17:09)
like each like (17:07 - 17:10)
sure yeah (17:09 - 17:13)
you can easily throw a match (17:10 - 17:16)
hey i've seen i've seen like um oh you (17:13 - 17:20)
got your hoopa finally (17:16 - 17:20)
hey i got my hoopa like 40 minutes ago (17:21 - 17:26)
i shouldn't have told you guys about (17:24 - 17:28)
hoop but now you're like desperate (17:26 - 17:30)
i ain't desperate for nothing i got (17:28 - 17:32)
three hoopas and pokemon (17:30 - 17:35)
home bank whatever it's called (17:32 - 17:35)
i don't need any more hoopas they're too (17:37 - 17:41)
mischievous (17:40 - 17:44)
i i i have seen some like top unite (17:41 - 17:46)
players talk about how the state of the (17:44 - 17:49)
game is not good (17:46 - 17:52)
specifically because jungle is just so (17:49 - 17:54)
broken not i don't know if bro that's (17:52 - 17:56)
the word they used i don't know if i (17:54 - 17:58)
broke it in what way (17:56 - 17:59)
it just has so much more experience than (17:58 - 18:02)
everything else oh yeah and i i (17:59 - 18:03)
personally feel like (18:02 - 18:07)
it it's not zapdos it's not dreadna it's (18:03 - 18:10)
how good is your jungler yeah i mean a (18:07 - 18:12)
good jungler will (18:10 - 18:14)
help although (18:12 - 18:16)
like if we start the match and no one (18:14 - 18:19)
knows who's jungling even though because (18:16 - 18:21)
no one like because we're i'm still in (18:19 - 18:23)
ultra rank and people don't know what (18:21 - 18:24)
like people still are not just saying (18:23 - 18:26)
what lane they're doing so it's like i (18:24 - 18:28)
know well there's a there's there's a (18:26 - 18:30)
guard chomp and there's this froakie (18:28 - 18:32)
which one is going just going either (18:30 - 18:34)
neither one said they're going jungle (18:32 - 18:35)
and then all of a sudden neither of them (18:34 - 18:37)
like we lost like no one's going to (18:35 - 18:40)
jungle we lost and then it's like (18:37 - 18:42)
or it's the other way where both the (18:40 - 18:45)
froakie and the the guard chomp are in (18:42 - 18:47)
general it's like we lost you broke up (18:45 - 18:51)
the experience too much yeah and or you (18:47 - 18:52)
do have like a score bunny that decides (18:51 - 18:54)
to go jungle and and they're not in (18:52 - 18:57)
there long enough and it's like will you (18:54 - 18:58)
miss this core fish you missed that dude (18:57 - 19:00)
like what are you what we lost because (18:58 - 19:02)
you're not like (19:00 - 19:03)
i (19:02 - 19:05)
i think you're being very jungle blamey (19:03 - 19:08)
right now especially since you don't (19:05 - 19:10)
like jungle cram you don't like jungle (19:08 - 19:10)
crush (19:10 - 19:13)
you don't like jungle blissy you don't (19:10 - 19:15)
you have such narrow views of what is (19:13 - 19:18)
appropriate for what the jungle is how (19:15 - 19:21)
about you expand and say hey (19:18 - 19:24)
i'm jungle cram now (19:21 - 19:24)
nobody wants him in the jungle i have (19:24 - 19:31)
i have last minute jungle cram twice (19:28 - 19:33)
because no one else has opted for jungle (19:31 - 19:36)
and we won both those games (19:33 - 19:38)
there's a lot of experience yeah that's (19:36 - 19:40)
what i'm saying like if you expanded (19:38 - 19:42)
your limited view of who could go into (19:40 - 19:45)
the jungle you would be master rink (19:42 - 19:48)
right now that's i i should just (19:45 - 19:53)
turn signal jungle every time uh (19:48 - 19:53)
i do i do think united is in a slightly (19:58 - 20:03)
weird place (20:01 - 20:06)
well it's the first season of the game (20:03 - 20:08)
just coming out like (20:06 - 20:11)
it's gonna be in a weird place for a bit (20:08 - 20:13)
oh yeah yeah there's no way they could (20:11 - 20:15)
have perfected it straight out the gate (20:13 - 20:16)
also they're still introducing (20:15 - 20:19)
characters like yeah (20:16 - 20:21)
they have also a long way to go before (20:19 - 20:24)
they get to a settled this is this is (20:21 - 20:26)
what we want they also did the thing (20:24 - 20:28)
where they like buffed xspeed and they (20:26 - 20:31)
buffed goal getter and they nerfed (20:28 - 20:34)
um eject button eject button and (20:31 - 20:35)
everybody still uses his jackpot (20:34 - 20:37)
everyone's still using it because it's (20:35 - 20:38)
still (20:37 - 20:40)
better at a 20-second delay than any of (20:38 - 20:43)
your other garbage items (20:40 - 20:44)
ah (20:43 - 20:45)
i don't even know what the smoke thing (20:44 - 20:47)
does (20:45 - 20:50)
i try to use it once and it does (20:47 - 20:52)
nothing (20:50 - 20:56)
i still don't know what goal getter does (20:52 - 20:58)
i mean goal getter if you're a scorer (20:56 - 21:01)
goal getter cuts down the amount of time (20:58 - 21:04)
that it takes for you to score so like (21:01 - 21:06)
for i think score shield seems so good (21:04 - 21:09)
anyways yeah well like (21:06 - 21:13)
for gardevoir whose goal (21:09 - 21:16)
animation is five years (21:13 - 21:18)
it helps a little bit but it's still not (21:16 - 21:21)
as good as the others (21:18 - 21:21)
um yeah uh you know anyways i should get (21:24 - 21:28)
back to unite next week united is free (21:27 - 21:30)
to play you have like 20 days left of (21:28 - 21:32)
the season no 14 days left of the season (21:30 - 21:34)
if you want that syndra's scandal i know (21:32 - 21:37)

uh it's looker vision looker it's all (23:26 - 23:32)

do you think they'll be like (23:36 - 23:40)
hey maybe we should (23:38 - 23:44)
maybe try to justify why a z existed (23:40 - 23:48)
no a z existed (23:44 - 23:48)
for a lot of good reasons one of them (23:48 - 23:52)
was (23:51 - 23:55)
he built a crystal flower exactly and (23:52 - 23:57)
that's all you need from him he made a (23:55 - 23:59)
terrible mistake that he was cursed to (23:57 - 24:03)
immortal immortality and giganticism for (23:59 - 24:06)
and could not find peace for 3 000 years (24:03 - 24:09)
until his dark creation the crystal (24:06 - 24:11)
bloom cannon flower of death was (24:09 - 24:15)
destroyed yes and his eternal flowet (24:11 - 24:17)

be like uh it's been three thousand (24:17 - 24:21)
years i guess you're forgiven man the (24:19 - 24:23)
end of that game still bothers me (24:21 - 24:25)

they're like five (28:18 - 28:21)
yeah it seems fine it seems exciting i'm (28:25 - 28:28)
sure that'll be fine (28:27 - 28:30)
all the little one-off things they do (28:28 - 28:32)
are always fun and good yeah (28:30 - 28:34)
yeah like i'm always into them so (28:32 - 28:37)
i'm imagining these will be just as good (28:34 - 28:40)
like it's always fun when they like just (28:37 - 28:42)
get away from the main anime storyline (28:40 - 28:43)
and like hey let's play stuff off the (28:42 - 28:46)
video games and they always do a pretty (28:43 - 28:48)
you know some are better than others but (28:46 - 28:50)
generally i enjoy watching them and now (28:48 - 28:51)
i can watch them on my twitch on my (28:50 - 28:53)
switch (28:51 - 28:58)
on your switch or my tv (28:53 - 28:58)
yeah they (28:58 - 29:02)
this has been like a recurring theme i (29:00 - 29:04)

do i mean they keep getting like a (29:14 - 29:17)
million two million views on youtube so (29:15 - 29:20)
i guess you keep doing them (29:17 - 29:21)
except they don't get that ad money on (29:20 - 29:23)
youtube so i don't (29:21 - 29:25)
maybe the engagement's more important (29:23 - 29:27)
than the ad money (29:25 - 29:29)
do they need the ad money they (29:27 - 29:33)
definitely do not need the ad price (29:29 - 29:36)
but it never hurts (29:33 - 29:38)

actual pro (30:54 - 30:57)
the actual problem with these raid (30:55 - 30:58)
events (30:57 - 31:00)
are if you've stopped playing sword and (30:58 - 31:01)
shield (31:00 - 31:03)

and if you are out of wishing peace's (31:03 - 31:07)
last raid event and you haven't played (31:05 - 31:09)
since (31:07 - 31:12)

earlier to provide the best possible (37:10 - 37:15)

during government guidance or from local (39:47 - 39:51)
authorities we will notify ticket (39:49 - 39:54)
holders as soon as possible (39:51 - 39:54)
so there's there's a lot here (39:55 - 39:59)
um (39:59 - 40:03)
so i want to just disclose that i i did (40:01 - 40:05)
pay for my own (40:03 - 40:08)
safari zone st louis ticket (40:05 - 40:11)
so did greg so did will i will disclose (40:08 - 40:12)
that (40:11 - 40:15)
niantic did pay for my philadelphia plus (40:12 - 40:17)
my explorer pass ticket (40:15 - 40:20)
um because i was in talks with niantic (40:17 - 40:22)
during this time too (40:20 - 40:23)
and then (40:22 - 40:25)
obviously now i talk to niantic on a (40:23 - 40:27)
pretty regular basis as we've learned (40:25 - 40:28)
from this podcast where i say niantic is (40:27 - 40:31)
paid for my ticket (40:28 - 40:32)
so i just want to get that out there (40:31 - 40:35)
just to be clear um (40:32 - 40:36)
so i think they did a lot of things (40:35 - 40:38)
right although there's still a lot of (40:36 - 40:39)
questions here so i think the things (40:38 - 40:41)
they did right is like (40:39 - 40:43)
hey we're doing these events if you (40:41 - 40:44)
don't want to go (40:43 - 40:46)
you can just play at home i think that's (40:44 - 40:48)
cool yeah i think i think it's cool that (40:46 - 40:51)
they they did try to give us makeup (40:48 - 40:54)
events last year and i think some people (40:51 - 40:55)
who didn't buy tickets are pretty salty (40:54 - 40:57)
about this that we got an event last (40:55 - 40:59)
year that we could play at home and then (40:57 - 41:02)
we got another event this year but (40:59 - 41:04)
i think overall that's like the right (41:02 - 41:06)
choice like we didn't know (41:04 - 41:09)
how long the pandemic was gonna last it (41:06 - 41:11)
was a bummer (41:09 - 41:12)
it was a bummer to get your events (41:11 - 41:14)
canceled so niantic doing something to (41:12 - 41:16)
be like hey i know this really sucks you (41:14 - 41:18)
probably got multiple events canceled so (41:16 - 41:21)
let's try to do something to (41:18 - 41:23)
instate some goodwill (41:21 - 41:26)
i mean when you sent this hey like hey (41:23 - 41:29)
the safari thing is back on i literally (41:26 - 41:30)
had completely forgotten this was a (41:29 - 41:32)
thing (41:30 - 41:36)
me too i was like the what (41:32 - 41:38)
oh right we were supposed to do a thing (41:36 - 41:41)
yeah five years ago (41:38 - 41:44)
i i i think this was the uh the worry (41:41 - 41:46)
all along is like hey if we reschedule (41:44 - 41:48)
this just because you had off back in (41:46 - 41:51)
2020 for this event doesn't like (41:48 - 41:53)
i don't have off (41:51 - 41:56)
friday october 29th through the 31st i (41:53 - 41:57)
am literally moving to a whole different (41:56 - 41:58)
state (41:57 - 42:00)
that day (41:58 - 42:01)
so this was kind of the worry we talked (42:00 - 42:03)
about last year is like (42:01 - 42:05)
yeah yeah they have to reschedule of (42:03 - 42:07)
course like a bunch of concerts had to (42:05 - 42:09)
reschedule a bunch of other uh (42:07 - 42:11)
irl events had to reschedule (42:09 - 42:13)
but if you bought something a year ago a (42:11 - 42:15)
lot changes in a year like then (42:13 - 42:17)
sometimes you just have life events that (42:15 - 42:19)
you can't yep do (42:17 - 42:21)
the other the worry about the st louis (42:19 - 42:23)
one is (42:21 - 42:25)
it's (42:23 - 42:28)
five days before diamond and pearl come (42:25 - 42:30)
out like do i want to be in another (42:28 - 42:32)
state (42:30 - 42:34)
when i could be like prepping for this (42:32 - 42:36)
big game release coming out it's very (42:34 - 42:38)
like (42:36 - 42:38)
i'm curious if the reason they were like (42:38 - 42:43)
hey (42:41 - 42:45)
let's we we're let's do it before the (42:43 - 42:47)
end of the year is because one of these (42:45 - 42:49)
three venues were like we're not going (42:47 - 42:51)
to give you your money back (42:49 - 42:53)
if you don't do the event and they're (42:51 - 42:54)
like well (42:53 - 42:56)
i don't think all three of them said (42:54 - 42:58)
that but i bet one of those three (42:56 - 42:59)
locations were like (42:58 - 43:01)
if you don't do your event by the end of (42:59 - 43:02)
the year you don't get your security (43:01 - 43:05)
position i guarantee having talked to (43:02 - 43:06)
people who had this exact thing happen (43:05 - 43:08)
with weddings (43:06 - 43:11)
yes they were told okay we're you're at (43:08 - 43:13)
the you're at the end you either need to (43:11 - 43:16)
do it or (43:13 - 43:19)
there's we're not refunding you (43:16 - 43:21)
and uh yeah if one if one of these (43:19 - 43:23)
cities put pressure on them i'm sure (43:21 - 43:24)
they were just like well let's just do (43:23 - 43:26)
all three (43:24 - 43:26)
liverpool (43:28 - 43:31)
yeah probably liverpool (43:29 - 43:33)
um (43:31 - 43:33)
we've we've been talking the three of us (43:33 - 43:37)
we're probably going to go to the st (43:35 - 43:39)
louis one yeah (43:37 - 43:40)
i would say this is easier we're all at (43:39 - 43:42)
that point we'll all be in the same (43:40 - 43:44)
place so going and coming back will be a (43:42 - 43:46)
lot easier but also (43:44 - 43:49)
we already we have tickets for st louis (43:46 - 43:50)
yeah (43:49 - 43:52)
and i was the only one that had tickets (43:50 - 43:54)
to philadelphia correct right and you (43:52 - 43:56)
can't get tickets now (43:54 - 43:57)
right (43:56 - 43:59)
so i i i could actually probably get you (43:57 - 44:02)
guys tickets but we i'm moving i keep so (43:59 - 44:05)
we can't go anyways it's a stretch (44:02 - 44:08)
uh that we're not applying to england (44:05 - 44:08)
i i (44:08 - 44:11)
i think if eve even if i could even if (44:08 - 44:13)
niantic was like yeah here's two extra (44:11 - 44:15)
tickets (44:13 - 44:17)
it's way easier for us just because we (44:15 - 44:19)
would have we're driving to st louis (44:17 - 44:21)
that was the plan yep because it's like (44:19 - 44:23)
a six hour you and greg (44:21 - 44:26)
have a nice trip i'll see you there (44:23 - 44:26)
the plan was to drive (44:28 - 44:30)
um (44:30 - 44:33)
[Music] (44:30 - 44:34)
i feel (44:33 - 44:37)
we were pax is happening this weekend (44:34 - 44:39)
and (44:37 - 44:39)
looking at people (44:40 - 44:45)
like i they they're checking vaccine (44:42 - 44:47)
vaccine cards you have to wear a mask (44:45 - 44:49)
i'm it (44:47 - 44:52)
looks to be somewhat well run i think (44:49 - 44:55)
the reason i i still (44:52 - 44:55)
well obviously we didn't go to pax we're (44:55 - 45:00)
here we're here um i feel like an (44:57 - 45:02)
outdoor event feels better an outdoor (45:00 - 45:04)
event is better (45:02 - 45:05)
let's be real (45:04 - 45:09)
i mean pax is rolling the dice (45:05 - 45:10)
hardcore (45:09 - 45:12)
and they're taking every precaution that (45:10 - 45:14)
they can they are still (45:12 - 45:15)
rolling the this is the person that went (45:14 - 45:17)
to the state fair this year twice (45:15 - 45:20)
so like i know that i'm taking a risk (45:17 - 45:23)
going to large in-person events (45:20 - 45:25)
granted much of the safer as outdoors (45:23 - 45:27)
and i was wearing my mask all the time (45:25 - 45:28)
but a lot of people weren't like it is a (45:27 - 45:31)
risk it is a risk to do any of this but (45:28 - 45:33)
outdoor is (45:31 - 45:36)
x amount safer than indoor here's why i (45:33 - 45:37)
feel good about it (45:36 - 45:40)
st louis specifically they they sold x (45:37 - 45:42)
amount of tickets right we don't know (45:40 - 45:43)
how many they sold (45:42 - 45:46)
and they said you don't have to come (45:43 - 45:46)
yeah (45:46 - 45:48)
so (45:46 - 45:51)
i would wager to bet that at least 25 (45:48 - 45:53)
percent of people are already through in (45:51 - 45:54)
the towel and we're like we're not i'm (45:53 - 45:56)
not going well (45:54 - 45:58)
at home like i had to rearrange like i (45:56 - 46:00)
don't even know if i can get this time (45:58 - 46:01)
off like (46:00 - 46:03)
i wasn't sure i had vacation time i had (46:01 - 46:07)
not planned on it i had to clear it like (46:03 - 46:09)
it's not a lot of warning to say in (46:07 - 46:12)
september we're doing it in november (46:09 - 46:15)
especially for travel like it's it's not (46:12 - 46:17)
a great amount of lead time i i can make (46:15 - 46:19)
it work but i bet you a lot of people (46:17 - 46:21)
can't also (46:19 - 46:23)
november in the midwest ain't (46:21 - 46:26)
particularly warm yeah it's it's either (46:23 - 46:27)
going to be 70 degrees or it's going to (46:26 - 46:30)
be 20 degrees yeah let's go in between (46:27 - 46:33)
in november the midwest (46:30 - 46:35)
normal fall or (46:33 - 46:36)
we're head long into winter like we have (46:35 - 46:38)
no idea what the weather's going to be (46:36 - 46:41)
like at that time framing yeah (46:38 - 46:43)
also like we have to deal with hotel we (46:41 - 46:44)
have to deal with like a lot of things (46:43 - 46:46)
and staying in hotels it's also like (46:44 - 46:47)
weird (46:46 - 46:49)
it's a year later and you don't get to (46:47 - 46:51)
re-pick your i get it you don't get to (46:49 - 46:53)
re-pick your day though so like (46:51 - 46:55)
yeah in the situation for philadelphia (46:53 - 46:56)
if i don't remember if i had a friday (46:55 - 46:58)
saturday or sunday if i had a friday i (46:56 - 47:00)
could be like well i can at least play (46:58 - 47:02)
it at home if i have the saturday ticket (47:00 - 47:04)
i'm literally in a moving truck for six (47:02 - 47:06)
hours that day like yeah there ain't no (47:04 - 47:08)
plan on saturday (47:06 - 47:10)
wait a minute i thought i was driving (47:08 - 47:11)
the moving truck well we'll be oh i'll (47:10 - 47:14)
be in the car behind the moving truck (47:11 - 47:17)
i will be here baking cookies to welcome (47:14 - 47:19)
you oh i'm in front of the moving truck (47:17 - 47:19)
no (47:19 - 47:22)
not the way you drive buddy oh moving (47:19 - 47:23)

movie truck will's driving me off the (47:25 - 47:30)
road yeah you are you are (47:27 - 47:32)
in the dust let's be real you're going (47:30 - 47:35)
to say goodbye to your possessions your (47:32 - 47:37)
extra car you're just going to see like (47:35 - 47:40)
the streak get me out of here (47:37 - 47:42)
will in a moving truck name a more (47:40 - 47:44)
powerful duo (47:42 - 47:46)
i'm like a shell smash crustle on those (47:44 - 47:49)
roads yeah (47:46 - 47:52)
moving trunk will the new op (47:49 - 47:54)
i i know some people are upset that (47:52 - 47:55)
they're not selling more tickets it's (47:54 - 47:59)
probably more complicated than that like (47:55 - 48:00)
if look (47:59 - 48:02)
how many times have they messed up (48:00 - 48:03)
tickets for for (48:02 - 48:04)
[Music] (48:03 - 48:06)
other events i think it's probably like (48:04 - 48:08)
we just need to get these done (48:06 - 48:10)
let's not try to get more like this is i (48:08 - 48:12)
don't think it's about making money no i (48:10 - 48:15)
think it's like we just well i mean i (48:12 - 48:16)
think it's about not losing i think it's (48:15 - 48:19)
about not losing money it is about it is (48:16 - 48:21)
about loss (48:19 - 48:24)
and not about gain yes as somebody (48:21 - 48:27)
uh i i once heard talk about their job (48:24 - 48:30)
when they were um basically anti (48:27 - 48:32)
shoplifting uh loss prevention (48:30 - 48:35)
management yep (48:32 - 48:37)
i'm sure they already have like since (48:35 - 48:38)
last year i'm sure they have like (48:37 - 48:40)
standees and and (48:38 - 48:43)
irl things that say st louis or (48:40 - 48:46)
pittsburgh philadelphia um (48:43 - 48:47)
that they're just going to set up (48:46 - 48:48)
they're going to use hopefully it'll be (48:47 - 48:50)
an okay weekend and then they throw all (48:48 - 48:52)
that out and then they we did it (48:50 - 48:55)
we did it and maybe next year they can (48:52 - 48:58)
do safari zones (48:55 - 49:01)
properly fingers crossed (48:58 - 49:05)
uh not sure let's let's hope (49:01 - 49:05)
i'm curious i'm super curious (49:06 - 49:11)
i think it's easy for uh enough for us (49:09 - 49:13)
to jet down to st louis spend the night (49:11 - 49:14)
do the day (49:13 - 49:16)
jet back (49:14 - 49:18)
and then we have something to talk about (49:16 - 49:20)
i enjoy how he describes an eight-hour (49:18 - 49:22)
drive yeah (49:20 - 49:24)
you know get down i mean we're not (49:22 - 49:28)
spending the weekend in st louis (49:24 - 49:28)
uh (49:28 - 49:32)
i mean it's st louis what's there to do (49:28 - 49:33)
good hamburgers at that one restaurant (49:32 - 49:36)
yeah visit people (49:33 - 49:36)
uh (49:36 - 49:38)
hey they want to visit st louis they can (49:36 - 49:40)
come to tower grove park or whatever (49:38 - 49:43)
it's called (49:40 - 49:43)
but they don't have to take it for the (49:43 - 49:45)
day that we're on i don't even know what (49:44 - 49:47)
day we're on there's no way that there's (49:45 - 49:49)
no way any of these events are going to (49:47 - 49:53)
be fenced in it's going to be like um (49:49 - 49:53)
go fest in chicago it wasn't fenced in (49:54 - 49:57)
you just had the (49:56 - 50:00)
the virtual ticket gave you the (49:57 - 50:03)
spawns or whatever (50:00 - 50:05)
i think it's fine i think (50:03 - 50:07)
they're trying (50:05 - 50:09)
uh (50:07 - 50:09)
i mean this is coming off of the (50:10 - 50:14)
communication news that they posted we (50:11 - 50:15)
don't we don't have to go too much in (50:14 - 50:17)
this i covered this on my stream but (50:15 - 50:19)
september 1st we heard from you update (50:17 - 50:21)
from our task force pretty much what's (50:19 - 50:23)
going to happen here pretty much (50:21 - 50:25)
obviously we the 80 we talked about this (50:23 - 50:27)
last week the 80 is um (50:25 - 50:29)
permanent not 40. also some (50:27 - 50:31)
clarification here (50:29 - 50:32)
uh (50:31 - 50:35)
80 meters is 80 meters from you to the (50:32 - 50:36)
stop (50:35 - 50:39)
ah so i was right (50:36 - 50:42)
so will was right it's it's a diameter (50:39 - 50:45)
not a radius yes diameter not radiance (50:42 - 50:48)
right i mean it's a radius radius (50:45 - 50:52)
making it worse it is a radius (50:48 - 50:52)
uh they apologize so so they're they're (50:53 - 50:59)
september 1st we we heard you (50:57 - 51:01)
was (50:59 - 51:04)
we wanted to roll out the 80. we messed (51:01 - 51:06)
up we apologize (51:04 - 51:08)
we're not going to go by country by (51:06 - 51:10)
country basis like they tried to do with (51:08 - 51:11)
new zealand and (51:10 - 51:12)
the united states are going to treat the (51:11 - 51:15)
whole world as one (51:12 - 51:17)
which i can see both sides to that (51:15 - 51:19)
um (51:17 - 51:20)
and then they said they're going to (51:19 - 51:23)
start publishing a developer diary every (51:20 - 51:25)
other month so six times a year first (51:23 - 51:27)
one will be october (51:25 - 51:28)
they're gonna keep setting up regular (51:27 - 51:31)
conversations with community leaders (51:28 - 51:34)
uh which at this point you guys know (51:31 - 51:36)
that i've am one of these community (51:34 - 51:38)
leaders there's no (51:36 - 51:40)
webs like (51:38 - 51:43)
prior to this happening niantic didn't (51:40 - 51:45)
want us to talk about this (51:43 - 51:47)
which was kind of weird (51:45 - 51:49)
so when i was like hey when (51:47 - 51:51)
if if i talk to you guys and you say (51:49 - 51:54)
something and then i talk to my audience (51:51 - 51:55)
what do you how do you want me to frame (51:54 - 51:57)
that and they're like (51:55 - 51:59)
well just treat it like a news source (51:57 - 52:02)
like if ign contacted us ign would stay (51:59 - 52:05)
we talked to niantic and i was like (52:02 - 52:07)
yeah i guess that makes sense but (52:05 - 52:09)
now that you're using the words (52:07 - 52:11)
community leaders (52:09 - 52:14)
maybe you should list who they are i (52:11 - 52:15)
don't know it doesn't care it doesn't (52:14 - 52:16)
matter (52:15 - 52:18)
it's really dumb though hey we're (52:16 - 52:21)
talking with these people (52:18 - 52:24)
we don't know who they are we don't know (52:21 - 52:25)
who they are (52:24 - 52:28)
um we will continue to work uh we will (52:25 - 52:30)
continue to work and update the known (52:28 - 52:32)
issue pages so the known issue pages has (52:30 - 52:34)
always (52:32 - 52:36)
been around i have probably been to it (52:34 - 52:38)
like twice maybe three times in the last (52:36 - 52:39)
five years (52:38 - 52:41)
i don't know how often it was getting (52:39 - 52:43)
updated (52:41 - 52:45)
but when i checked it (52:43 - 52:48)
it said last updated september 1st so (52:45 - 52:51)
um (52:48 - 52:51)
yeah i and i think i think overall this (52:51 - 52:55)
is the thing i wanted more than the (52:53 - 52:57)
distance was (52:55 - 53:01)
you guys just need to talk to us better (52:57 - 53:02)
like if you're if if you're going to (53:01 - 53:04)
change something (53:02 - 53:06)
and then not say why you're just letting (53:04 - 53:09)
your audience wildly speculate (53:06 - 53:10)
and the audience is always going to be (53:09 - 53:14)
like it's because of money (53:10 - 53:14)
uh so (53:15 - 53:17)
uh (53:16 - 53:19)
this this was a good start though i mean (53:17 - 53:20)
like they they they didn't really come (53:19 - 53:23)
out in this letter and have a bunch of (53:20 - 53:25)
excuses it was pretty much we messed up (53:23 - 53:26)
we're sorry (53:25 - 53:28)
we'll do better and i don't know what (53:26 - 53:31)
else you would want from that (53:28 - 53:31)
i mean a lot of apologies feel really (53:32 - 53:36)
hollow or really like we're sorry we got (53:34 - 53:37)
caught (53:36 - 53:39)
apologies (53:37 - 53:40)
i mean (53:39 - 53:44)
this is a step above that sure yeah yeah (53:40 - 53:46)
i mean that's a low bar it's a low bar (53:44 - 53:48)
and they are making material changes and (53:46 - 53:50)
they are actually making changes right (53:48 - 53:51)
like (53:50 - 53:53)
the the two things that they needed to (53:51 - 53:55)
do was like hey we messed up and we (53:53 - 53:58)
fixed it like i don't need much more (53:55 - 54:01)
from the apology than that like yeah (53:58 - 54:04)
uh i mean i mean (54:01 - 54:04)
i am excited to see what happens going (54:04 - 54:09)
forward like i don't necessarily trust (54:07 - 54:11)
them because i don't tend to trust any (54:09 - 54:12)
corporation but (54:11 - 54:16)
i am curious what their plan is how (54:12 - 54:18)
these developer things are going to be (54:16 - 54:22)
like what is the deal (54:18 - 54:22)
yeah i i hope that there are (54:28 - 54:32)
not (54:34 - 54:37)
but (54:35 - 54:38)
it's it's not like i i'm desperate for (54:37 - 54:40)
new features but it would be it would be (54:38 - 54:42)
nice if (54:40 - 54:44)
things that were annoying in the game (54:42 - 54:46)
were resolved (54:44 - 54:49)
so not necessarily like bug fixes but (54:46 - 54:51)
there are mechanics in the game that (54:49 - 54:53)
just feel very outdated (54:51 - 54:57)
did you or did you not get socks (54:53 - 55:00)
you know we did finally get socks that's (54:57 - 55:01)
true so (55:00 - 55:04)

there is always something going on (58:07 - 58:13)
was it pokemon related earlier no (58:10 - 58:15)
was there a pokemon related club thing (58:13 - 58:17)
probably (58:15 - 58:17)
oh this form is like really advanced (58:18 - 58:24)
i mean my elementary school had an (58:21 - 58:27)
after-school like pokemon tcg club that (58:24 - 58:30)
we used to go to (58:27 - 58:30)
to play pokemon tcg (58:31 - 58:36)
holy cow can i read this question (58:33 - 58:39)
so faq on this uh (58:36 - 58:41)
american association of school (58:39 - 58:44)
librarians (58:41 - 58:47)
em i am a middle school librarian can i (58:44 - 58:49)
apply (58:47 - 58:53)
i'm not making this up it literally says (58:49 - 58:58)
yes and no periods yep (58:53 - 58:58)
what (58:58 - 59:01)
before applying we would ask to confirm (59:04 - 59:08)
your students interest in administrator (59:07 - 59:11)
support aasl understands that there is (59:08 - 59:14)
fluidity between grade levels and a wide (59:11 - 59:16)
variety of learning levels activity (59:14 - 59:18)
interests and skill levels wait why (59:16 - 59:20)
would they okay so yes and no what why (59:18 - 59:22)
do what did you say (59:20 - 59:25)
wait where are you finding this faq (59:22 - 59:27)
you have to click the american (59:25 - 59:29)
association of libraries i did and i'll (59:27 - 59:31)
say no faq (59:29 - 59:33)
scroll down (59:31 - 59:35)
here i'll link it (59:33 - 59:36)
already (59:35 - 59:38)
are they are they saying that like okay (59:36 - 59:41)
so they did say like anime (59:38 - 59:43)
and i'm sure there's like worksheets i (59:41 - 59:44)
mean you can see the worksheets here (59:43 - 59:45)
there's like a coloring there's like a (59:44 - 59:49)
bingo there's like a cutout (59:45 - 59:51)
so the issue is (59:49 - 59:52)
but the pokemon trading card game is (59:51 - 59:55)
like very advanced like there's a lot of (59:52 - 59:59)
math there's learning there's like (59:55 - 60:01)
like chess i mean chess club's the thing (59:59 - 60:03)
but this isn't trading card game this is (60:01 - 60:04)
uh other (60:03 - 60:06)
but the issue is (60:04 - 60:10)
in some places middle school is like (60:06 - 60:12)
fifth (60:10 - 60:14)
fifth sixth (60:12 - 60:16)
no no (60:14 - 60:19)
no some places it's like fifth grade (60:16 - 60:22)
through ninth grade yeah some places (60:19 - 60:23)
it's only seventh and eighth grade so (60:22 - 60:25)
like different places called middle (60:23 - 60:29)
school different things so that's why (60:25 - 60:31)
in one school district i went to middle (60:29 - 60:33)
school was seven eight nine (60:31 - 60:35)
yeah i moved districts it was only seven (60:33 - 60:37)
eight and there's another district where (60:35 - 60:39)
it's six seven eight (60:37 - 60:42)
so like i was six seven eight (60:39 - 60:45)
varies wildly (60:42 - 60:45)
but i would say middle schoolers and the (60:46 - 60:50)
pokemon trading card game is a good but (60:48 - 60:52)
this isn't trading card game but they (60:50 - 60:54)
did say that they said it on the pokemon (60:52 - 60:55)
web page (60:54 - 60:57)
i mean it says after school will meet (60:55 - 60:59)
once a week for an hour participating (60:57 - 61:02)
students will have tools to learn to (60:59 - 61:04)
play the pokemon trading card game (61:02 - 61:05)
episodes of the series to watch and (61:04 - 61:07)
other fun activities and resources (61:05 - 61:09)
there's other stuff as well (61:07 - 61:11)
i think it's the other activities and (61:09 - 61:13)
resources yeah that are it says (61:11 - 61:16)
recommended age is between six to ten (61:13 - 61:18)
how old are you in fifth grade (61:16 - 61:20)
eleven ten (61:18 - 61:22)
eleven uh fifth grade ten ten to eleven (61:20 - 61:26)
fourth grade is definitely ten (61:22 - 61:26)
or nine nine to ten nine to ten (61:29 - 61:34)
look at kindergarten first grade is like (61:34 - 61:41)
six i don't know i feel like (61:37 - 61:41)
maybe like if you don't want a huge (61:46 - 61:50)
focus on the tcg then you probably (61:48 - 61:52)
shouldn't lead with the tcg in your like (61:50 - 61:54)
after school activities it was like (61:52 - 61:55)
literally your first bullet point (61:54 - 61:56)
because the tcg can be really (61:55 - 62:00)
complicated i ran a tcg (61:56 - 62:01)
weekly (62:00 - 62:04)
club thing official play organized you (62:01 - 62:06)
fill out the professor form you pick up (62:04 - 62:07)
go to a (62:06 - 62:09)
retail establishment say hey can i do (62:07 - 62:11)
pokemon cards every wednesday night here (62:09 - 62:14)
i did all that it was a nightmare let me (62:11 - 62:16)
tell you it was like (62:14 - 62:20)
kids i don't dislike kids (62:16 - 62:23)
no you don't dislike them you actively (62:20 - 62:23)
yeah (62:23 - 62:26)
no no no no i've seen you walk up to a (62:23 - 62:28)
child eating an ice cream cone and knock (62:26 - 62:30)
it out of their hand and go point at (62:28 - 62:32)
them and go (62:30 - 62:32)
i (62:33 - 62:37)
i like (62:36 - 62:39)
teaching people how to do stuff (62:37 - 62:42)
educational but you're so bad at it oh (62:39 - 62:46)
my gosh you're the worst i will (62:42 - 62:50)
sit like i am the i am the i'm the greg (62:46 - 62:51)
don't you shake your head i'm the one (62:50 - 62:53)
reading the real rule book and i'm like (62:51 - 62:55)
teaching the rules yeah you read the (62:53 - 62:57)
rule book the amount of times that i've (62:55 - 62:59)
learned a game wrong from you i have (62:57 - 63:02)
about 50 50. never taught you a game (62:59 - 63:05)
ryan he always leaves something out i (63:02 - 63:07)
have never had an experience of trying (63:05 - 63:08)
to teach me something without him (63:07 - 63:10)
leaving one and he's like oh i just (63:08 - 63:12)
assumed you would have figured that part (63:10 - 63:16)
no teaching is not about assuming buddy (63:12 - 63:18)
i teach for a living i should teach the (63:16 - 63:20)
things (63:18 - 63:20)
either way here's the thing the starter (63:21 - 63:27)
decks the starter decks are designed to (63:24 - 63:30)
be simple to play that's what the intent (63:27 - 63:31)
of this is (63:30 - 63:34)
sure (63:31 - 63:36)
these parents would come to this (63:34 - 63:40)
hobby lobby or hobby hobbytown jesus (63:36 - 63:42)
wow you're doing it at a hobby lobby (63:40 - 63:45)
store just it up a couple of miles get (63:42 - 63:48)
out christians we're here now (63:45 - 63:50)
we're playing our (63:48 - 63:52)
satan pokemon game over here over here (63:50 - 63:56)
aisle four and aisle four (63:52 - 63:57)
i was at a hobby town (63:56 - 63:59)
and these parents would come (63:57 - 64:01)
and they would drop their kid there was (63:59 - 64:03)
two types of parents there was the (64:01 - 64:05)
parents that would show up they would (64:03 - 64:07)
drop their kid off and they would say (64:05 - 64:09)
i'll see you in an hour and (64:07 - 64:13)
the kids would always be the same they (64:09 - 64:14)
so wait hold on (64:13 - 64:16)
let me break this down into like a (64:14 - 64:18)
family tree (64:16 - 64:20)
so two types of parents so branching one (64:18 - 64:22)
is parent that drops a little timmy off (64:20 - 64:24)
so either little timmy would play the (64:22 - 64:26)
game for like 10 minutes and then just (64:24 - 64:29)
browse the aisles of the the hobbytown (64:26 - 64:31)
for the next 50 minutes that's what i (64:29 - 64:32)
would do (64:31 - 64:35)
or the little timmy would sit and just (64:32 - 64:38)
continue to cheat for the hour (64:35 - 64:39)
so (64:38 - 64:42)
or you have parent number two (64:39 - 64:45)
which shows up and they stay (64:42 - 64:47)
and they read a book or they're on their (64:45 - 64:50)
ipad for the hour and their kids were (64:47 - 64:52)
significantly more well behaved than the (64:50 - 64:54)
parent one which was like (64:52 - 64:56)
i'm just gonna trust my kid here at a (64:54 - 64:57)
hot like uh (64:56 - 64:59)
what (64:57 - 64:59)
now (64:59 - 65:02)
at the hobbytown i was we had a lot of (64:59 - 65:04)
like people my age (65:02 - 65:05)
as well (65:04 - 65:07)
um (65:05 - 65:09)
but no one wanted to play with like that (65:07 - 65:10)
ten-year-olds (65:09 - 65:13)
babysitters (65:10 - 65:15)
it was it it was (65:13 - 65:18)
a nightmare to run that (65:15 - 65:20)
and it was a lot more work than just (65:18 - 65:22)
like i just want a place to play pokemon (65:20 - 65:24)
every wednesday night (65:22 - 65:28)
[Laughter] (65:24 - 65:31)
your own selfish desires brought you to (65:28 - 65:34)
this end yeah (65:31 - 65:34)
what i'm saying is i don't think i could (65:35 - 65:39)
ever be an elementary school teacher no (65:36 - 65:43)
this is 100 correct yes you are correct (65:39 - 65:45)
nor could you be an elementary school (65:43 - 65:47)
librarian (65:45 - 65:50)
that seems less stressful no no you (65:47 - 65:52)
gotta figure out which kid stole what (65:50 - 65:54)
book off the shelf (65:52 - 65:56)
when they are out of options they go to (65:54 - 65:59)
the library and harass the librarian (65:56 - 66:01)
uh it's cool that they're doing this i'd (65:59 - 66:03)
i'd be curious of how successful it will (66:01 - 66:06)
be i feel like well i went to mps so (66:03 - 66:08)
any of these things that'd be a hard no (66:06 - 66:10)
from every like they don't want extra (66:08 - 66:11)
work (66:10 - 66:12)
they don't get paid enough to host some (66:11 - 66:16)
pokemon club (66:12 - 66:17)
usually you get paid extra if you do an (66:16 - 66:20)
extracurricular (66:17 - 66:21)
money yeah yeah (66:20 - 66:23)
really yeah (66:21 - 66:25)
it's one of the few ways they can bump (66:23 - 66:27)
up that salary a little bit oh i didn't (66:25 - 66:30)
know that interesting (66:27 - 66:32)
what about so if you're the librarian (66:30 - 66:33)
and you're like i'm going to host the (66:32 - 66:34)
pokemon club you get a little something (66:33 - 66:37)
something too i mean it's a standard if (66:34 - 66:40)
you host an extracurricular you get 50 (66:37 - 66:42)
extra dollars (66:40 - 66:45)
a month (66:42 - 66:45)
question of the week (66:48 - 66:53)
already all right yeah (66:51 - 66:55)
gee mini hold on (66:53 - 66:57)
it's the 25th anniversary there's no (66:55 - 66:59)
news i know i didn't know that that was (66:57 - 67:01)
the last bit of news like the last bit (66:59 - 67:03)
of news i thought you were holding (67:01 - 67:05)
something reserved all right ready no we (67:03 - 67:07)
ended on the librarian (67:05 - 67:11)
what is the question of the week what is (67:07 - 67:16)
the question of the week (67:11 - 67:16)
all right from our slack (67:17 - 67:21)
this is from (67:21 - 67:26)
ninja turtle raph (67:22 - 67:26)
what newer quality of life improvements (67:26 - 67:29)
would you like to see be added to the (67:28 - 67:31)
diamond and pro remakes that's a good (67:29 - 67:34)
question be able to switch out the (67:31 - 67:35)
pokeball (67:34 - 67:37)
you can't have the same answer that is (67:35 - 67:40)
not quality of life how is that not a (67:37 - 67:42)
quality of life yeah it is i have to (67:40 - 67:45)
breed to get it and i can't breed (67:42 - 67:47)
my starters into the ball that i want (67:45 - 67:49)
that is a quality of life improvement (67:47 - 67:50)
that is (67:49 - 67:52)
you know you know i still buy them you (67:50 - 67:55)
know why that will never happen (67:52 - 67:57)
because the pokeball factory isn't kalos (67:55 - 68:00)
no because the one time that one guy (67:57 - 68:02)
cheated and the only way they could tell (68:00 - 68:04)
was because it was in a dream ball and (68:02 - 68:06)
that pokemon could there's like no way (68:04 - 68:08)
it could have been in a dream ball so (68:06 - 68:10)
they're like oh wow yeah but that's out (68:08 - 68:12)
like yeah that was one that was ray (68:10 - 68:14)
rizzo too they didn't even disqualify (68:12 - 68:16)
him (68:14 - 68:16)
uh (68:17 - 68:22)
quality of life um (68:18 - 68:24)
i mean we we are assuming hms are out (68:22 - 68:27)
otherwise if not i want atms out uh yeah (68:24 - 68:28)
i mean that would be mine is like if (68:27 - 68:31)
there's hms i'm going to still attempt (68:28 - 68:34)
to enjoy the game but man those are (68:31 - 68:36)
like are we talking about newer quality (68:34 - 68:38)
of life so things that they've already (68:36 - 68:39)
done and we want to make sure they carry (68:38 - 68:41)
over into diamond and pearl do we think (68:39 - 68:44)
that what the question is is that i want (68:41 - 68:46)
faster breeding i want (68:44 - 68:47)
i want the breeding to be faster i want (68:46 - 68:49)
like the destiny not stuff to stick (68:47 - 68:52)
around i want the hm stuff to stick (68:49 - 68:54)
around see my problem with breeding is (68:52 - 68:56)
we just need new breeding the masuda (68:54 - 68:59)
method that has existed since gen 4 has (68:56 - 69:01)
barely changed i'm somebody's gonna be (68:59 - 69:03)
like well you could do egg moves easier (69:01 - 69:05)
but wait it's so different in (69:03 - 69:07)
i mean okay i was thinking shiny hunting (69:05 - 69:10)
because like in in galler it's just like (69:07 - 69:14)
kill as many combi as you can (69:10 - 69:17)
and eventually they'll get shinier and (69:14 - 69:19)
shinier what do you want to be better (69:17 - 69:21)
about breeding but it was like what (69:19 - 69:24)
what's funny though (69:21 - 69:26)
they added in the whole like if you have (69:24 - 69:28)
a move you don't have to get the egg (69:26 - 69:29)
anymore it can just be taught to the (69:28 - 69:31)
pokemon you put in there (69:29 - 69:33)
like as the big reason you did egg moves (69:31 - 69:35)
they got rid of (69:33 - 69:38)
bottle caps fixed breeding for evs (69:35 - 69:39)
like (69:38 - 69:42)
mints fixed breeding for nature's like (69:39 - 69:44)
what improvements do you want like well (69:42 - 69:46)
so the all of those to be in diamond and (69:44 - 69:47)
purple (69:46 - 69:48)
as i said i want all the breeding (69:47 - 69:50)
improvements to be diamond and pearls my (69:48 - 69:53)
job is going to be uh to have the shiny (69:50 - 69:55)
charm because the shiny charm didn't (69:53 - 69:57)
exist in diamond and pearl (69:55 - 69:58)
that's true (69:57 - 70:00)
i want the mark charm to be a diamond (69:58 - 70:03)
pro but there's no marks (70:00 - 70:04)
we don't know if there's no marks yeah i (70:03 - 70:05)
know i'm just saying i want the charm (70:04 - 70:07)
but no marks (70:05 - 70:09)
what what is something here i'm going to (70:07 - 70:11)
rephrase the question what is something (70:09 - 70:14)
that sword and shield still does poorly (70:11 - 70:16)
oh wait no (70:14 - 70:18)
here's what diamond in pearl needs (70:16 - 70:21)
access your boxes (70:18 - 70:24)
from wherever you are (70:21 - 70:26)
not having to go into a pokemon center (70:24 - 70:29)
that's the quality of life that we (70:26 - 70:30)
have forgotten (70:29 - 70:33)
was an issue (70:30 - 70:35)
well that was first in let's go (70:33 - 70:37)
and then it wasn't sword and shield (70:35 - 70:40)
and that feature is very good it's very (70:37 - 70:41)
very good (70:40 - 70:43)
uh i mean i want the union rooms to work (70:41 - 70:45)
better than wycombe (70:43 - 70:46)
well (70:45 - 70:48)
if we've learned anything from game (70:46 - 70:49)
freak (70:48 - 70:52)
it's that every online feature is worse (70:49 - 70:55)
than the last game you all complained (70:52 - 70:57)
about festival plaza (70:55 - 70:59)
and you're (70:57 - 70:59)
and now we got why come (71:00 - 71:05)
uh what do you think that certain shield (71:03 - 71:06)
does that's (71:05 - 71:09)
that needs improvement still (71:06 - 71:09)
i i just i don't know if i i don't think (71:10 - 71:16)
breeding is broken (71:13 - 71:18)
i just think it's bad (71:16 - 71:19)
like (71:18 - 71:21)
it's it's just the same thing right like (71:19 - 71:23)
when when i (71:21 - 71:26)
i think some stuff is good for a couple (71:23 - 71:28)
games but we're like four generations (71:26 - 71:30)
plus everything in between (71:28 - 71:33)
and it's like the same put two pokemon (71:30 - 71:34)
in (71:33 - 71:35)
spin in a circle (71:34 - 71:37)
okay and sun and moon they put like a (71:35 - 71:39)
little fence and you can like crawl into (71:37 - 71:42)
that fence and you can like spin (71:39 - 71:44)
and then auras they just gave you like (71:42 - 71:47)
an auto turn thing (71:44 - 71:47)
but it just feels so maintenance heavy (71:48 - 71:56)
that that like the little thing like the (71:52 - 71:57)
fence thing really bothered me because i (71:56 - 71:59)
would breed a lot in sun and moon and (71:57 - 72:01)
people were like why don't you go into (71:59 - 72:03)
the fence and do it and it's like but if (72:01 - 72:05)
i'm in the fence i can't talk to the (72:03 - 72:09)
girl and she keeps crossing her arms and (72:05 - 72:12)
i need more eggs like i need to talk to (72:09 - 72:13)
her to get eggs (72:12 - 72:16)
and they so i they'd be like (72:13 - 72:17)
so i could just keep talking to her over (72:16 - 72:20)
and over right to get a bunch of eggs (72:17 - 72:22)
and then take those eggs into the fence (72:20 - 72:24)
and spin but i still have to spin in (72:22 - 72:26)
front of her (72:24 - 72:28)
otherwise she's not going to cross her (72:26 - 72:29)
arms (72:28 - 72:31)
so if i'm spinning in front of her to (72:29 - 72:33)
get her to cross her arms i might as (72:31 - 72:35)
well be hatching eggs when i'm (72:33 - 72:39)
standing in front of her right (72:35 - 72:41)
she only crosses her arms based on your (72:39 - 72:42)
steps (72:41 - 72:44)
you can't just stand there well she (72:42 - 72:45)
crosses her arms when an egg is (72:44 - 72:48)
generated yeah right i mean (72:45 - 72:50)
you're gonna be anywhere you'll be (72:48 - 72:51)
wandering all over you could be doing (72:50 - 72:53)
new trials and come back (72:51 - 72:57)
that i think is the problem is like (72:53 - 72:57)
what if there was like an egg system (72:57 - 73:01)
where you could be everywhere in the (72:59 - 73:03)
world and the lady just puts them on a (73:01 - 73:05)
shelf for you or something like (73:03 - 73:07)
i kind of like because she you don't get (73:05 - 73:10)
a new egg until you talk to her and try (73:07 - 73:12)
what to do with these oh that's what you (73:10 - 73:15)
want to fix you want to say put all eggs (73:12 - 73:17)
on the shelf (73:15 - 73:20)
until i come back (73:17 - 73:21)
or just something new like like i'm (73:20 - 73:23)
saying like there's no point in having (73:21 - 73:24)
that little fence (73:23 - 73:27)
because you can't even reach her (73:24 - 73:28)
without you getting off (73:27 - 73:33)
the toros was it tauros (73:28 - 73:33)
talk to her (73:36 - 73:40)
get the do the egg biz get back on the (73:38 - 73:43)
tauros in the fence and spin that was so (73:40 - 73:45)
much worse oh this is you're the king of (73:43 - 73:48)
too many clicks (73:45 - 73:48)
the whole point of the fence was the (73:49 - 73:53)
toro spin really fast to hatch a bunch (73:51 - 73:56)
of eggs yes yes and it would hatch all (73:53 - 73:59)
six at once yes (73:56 - 74:02)
to like if you're going to leave the (73:59 - 74:04)
fence area get on and off your tauros (74:02 - 74:07)
just do it in front of her (74:04 - 74:08)
no (74:07 - 74:11)
now the fence made it so you just had it (74:08 - 74:14)
yeah the fence made it confined to you (74:11 - 74:14)
the why (74:14 - 74:17)
button in sword and shield does (74:16 - 74:19)
something different than the y button (74:17 - 74:22)
yeah like this is not a real issue for (74:19 - 74:25)
normal human beings and you're confusing (74:22 - 74:28)
yourself for a normal human being so (74:25 - 74:30)
here this is the quality of life issue i (74:28 - 74:31)
want in diamond april i want the y (74:30 - 74:33)
button in diamond and pearl when i'm in (74:31 - 74:35)
my boxes to do the same thing as the y (74:33 - 74:37)
button in pokemon home so i don't have (74:35 - 74:39)
to hear about it from (74:37 - 74:43)
his ridiculousness (74:39 - 74:43)
moon it was you were better off using (74:44 - 74:49)
stoutland than tauros do you know why (74:46 - 74:50)
how (74:49 - 74:52)
why i can't listen to this i'm like oh (74:50 - 74:55)
my gosh let me let me blow some minds (74:52 - 74:57)
stoutland was so much better than taurus (74:55 - 75:00)
because tauros was slower walking (74:57 - 75:02)
stoutland was faster walking scotland (75:00 - 75:05)
didn't have a speed boost tauros you had (75:02 - 75:07)
to hold down a button for taurus to go (75:05 - 75:10)
fast and there was rev up time and rev (75:07 - 75:11)
down time (75:10 - 75:13)
and so (75:11 - 75:16)
if you are a true breeder (75:13 - 75:19)
you want one hand free (75:16 - 75:19)
no (75:19 - 75:21)
you do you and your one hand free (75:19 - 75:24)
garbage (75:21 - 75:24)
boring and tedious that you want to have (75:27 - 75:31)
like a beverage in one hand maybe a (75:29 - 75:33)
daddy like my life that way no no no no (75:31 - 75:35)
no no no no (75:33 - 75:37)
one thing at a time will that's my name (75:35 - 75:40)
i will do a youtube video and i will (75:37 - 75:42)
show you all how are you showing me (75:40 - 75:44)
spoilers are you showing me star wars (75:42 - 75:46)
spinning in the fence or are you doing (75:44 - 75:47)
your own (75:46 - 75:50)
thing nobody else in the world does (75:47 - 75:51)
waste the time to go in the fence take (75:50 - 75:53)
the time because because when you once (75:51 - 75:55)
you go on the fence you got to leave the (75:53 - 75:57)
fence you got to get off you got to get (75:55 - 75:58)
on then once you're in there spinning (75:57 - 76:00)
you got to get off you got to get back (75:58 - 76:01)
on you got to talk to the lady because (76:00 - 76:02)
you can't talk to her in the fence and (76:01 - 76:04)
then she's she's crossing her arms and (76:02 - 76:06)
those are all the eggs you were missing (76:04 - 76:07)
because you're not you're you're stuck (76:06 - 76:12)
so many shiny pokemon inside the fence (76:07 - 76:14)
now you are coming to the realization (76:12 - 76:16)
you did it wrong you should have been on (76:14 - 76:17)
southland i should have been killing (76:16 - 76:20)
copies on honeycomb did you get your six (76:17 - 76:21)
eggs and you go to (76:20 - 76:23)
uh you go to the you you go to the ocean (76:21 - 76:25)
and then you hatch them on the sharpito (76:23 - 76:27)
that's the actual way you hatch the eggs (76:25 - 76:30)
six eggs five eggs flame body sharpie (76:27 - 76:31)
spin in the water that's the real way to (76:30 - 76:33)
have it no no no and what was that (76:31 - 76:34)
ridiculous thing i heard you say one (76:33 - 76:37)
time you're like everybody (76:34 - 76:39)
what was it it was like everybody uses (76:37 - 76:42)
false swipe to catch pokemon unless it's (76:39 - 76:44)
a steal and then you use so i was like i (76:42 - 76:46)
have literally i'm telling the world (76:44 - 76:49)
right now never use false swipe to catch (76:46 - 76:52)
a single pokemon ever so don't you (76:49 - 76:54)
everybody nothing yeah some people just (76:52 - 76:56)
chuck pokeballs which i think you should (76:54 - 76:59)
just do yes i'm here to have a good time (76:56 - 77:01)
not a scientifically derived (76:59 - 77:05)
method of clinical capture (77:01 - 77:09)
hyaluronic acid thank you (77:05 - 77:10)
the egg stuff (77:09 - 77:12)
i want new egg stuff i don't know what (77:10 - 77:12)
it is (77:12 - 77:14)
i want something to see this is the (77:12 - 77:16)
thing i don't know what it is i would (77:14 - 77:18)
have never thought of sos i would have (77:16 - 77:20)
never thought of hordes i would have (77:18 - 77:23)
never thought of pokey radar i ain't no (77:20 - 77:25)
game developer but what i do know is i'm (77:23 - 77:27)
sick of doing the same thing i've been (77:25 - 77:29)
doing since gen 4. (77:27 - 77:31)
that's what i'm saying give me something (77:29 - 77:33)
fresh spoiler alert two people breeding (77:31 - 77:36)
has been since humans existed (77:33 - 77:38)
yeah but these are pokemon (77:36 - 77:39)
yeah and we still don't know how that (77:38 - 77:41)
works in the pokemon world fyi but (77:39 - 77:43)
nobody knows (77:41 - 77:45)
pokemon (77:43 - 77:45)
instead of hatching on like a tauros or (77:46 - 77:49)
stout land i think it's when you're (77:47 - 77:51)
hatching out him a champ ah yes yeah (77:49 - 77:53)
yeah he carries you around that's the (77:51 - 77:54)
true (77:53 - 77:57)
that is the real way that is real to do (77:54 - 78:00)
it being cuddled (77:57 - 78:00)
this (78:03 - 78:06)
this is from uh bubble god animation (78:04 - 78:08)
from our youtube i'm pulling it because (78:06 - 78:10)
of greg (78:08 - 78:12)
what during a playthrough of sword and (78:10 - 78:14)
shield i noticed that rosalia is the on (78:12 - 78:18)
the floor pattern of the wind in hotel (78:14 - 78:19)
i don't think it's windy and i think (78:18 - 78:22)
it's it's the rose is the rose of the (78:19 - 78:24)
ron lin's hotel in windham stadium and (78:22 - 78:26)
what's also noticeable is that the (78:24 - 78:28)
hotel in (78:26 - 78:32)
what's the fire city dag nabbit i'm i'm (78:28 - 78:34)
literally there in the game right now (78:32 - 78:37)
the kabu city yeah yeah i thought that's (78:34 - 78:39)
where the rosalio first (78:37 - 78:41)
hotel (78:39 - 78:41)
uh what pokemon do you think would make (78:47 - 78:52)
the best looking decor for a hotel lobby (78:49 - 78:53)
i mean (78:52 - 78:57)
i liked it so much (78:53 - 78:57)
i got it on my channel you'll never get (78:58 - 79:02)
a job now you'll never be able to get a (79:00 - 79:04)
professional job i know how everyone we (79:02 - 79:06)
got to kick you off this podcast no (79:04 - 79:07)

would be criagonal i don't know if (79:21 - 79:24)
that's (79:23 - 79:26)
no that's a good one i think that is (79:24 - 79:28)
actually interesting (79:26 - 79:29)
uh like (79:28 - 79:32)
decor wise like (79:29 - 79:36)
bolton would be great (79:32 - 79:36)
like are we talking about high end or (79:37 - 79:40)
like a motel 6 type of thing because the (79:38 - 79:43)
motel 6 it's this pupa (79:40 - 79:45)
basically (79:43 - 79:52)
[Laughter] (79:45 - 79:52)
ah (79:53 - 79:57)
not pikachu (79:54 - 79:57)
i did one stay at a hotel in brazil that (79:58 - 80:03)
had these tiny (80:01 - 80:07)
monkeys in the courtyard (80:03 - 80:07)
so (80:07 - 80:09)
chim chars (80:07 - 80:12)
oh yeah (80:09 - 80:12)
chimp charts ah you know what uh is done (80:17 - 80:21)
really well in unite is they have like (80:20 - 80:23)
water fountains and i think one of them (80:21 - 80:24)
is like dugong and they're really (80:23 - 80:27)
they're really elegant i could see like (80:24 - 80:28)
i could see a (80:27 - 80:31)
swanna themed hotel like the all the (80:28 - 80:33)
fountains are uh (80:31 - 80:36)
uh are swan themed yeah just just to (80:33 - 80:38)
clarify for our listeners around the (80:36 - 80:40)
world um steve said water fountains (80:38 - 80:41)
where most people would say fountains (80:40 - 80:43)
because where he comes from a water (80:41 - 80:47)
fountain is a bubbler yes (80:43 - 80:50)
uh i don't say bubbler but i do know the (80:47 - 80:52)
reason why it says it's called bubbler (80:50 - 80:54)
it doesn't matter doesn't matter (80:52 - 80:57)
but i don't say bubbler water fountain (80:54 - 80:58)
means one thing something you drink (80:57 - 81:01)
water from anything else it's just a (80:58 - 81:03)
fountain (81:01 - 81:06)
uh (81:03 - 81:07)
so who's your choice (81:06 - 81:09)
what a dugong (81:07 - 81:11)
but that's already in the game pick a (81:09 - 81:12)
different one (81:11 - 81:13)
what (81:12 - 81:15)
um (81:13 - 81:15)
hmm (81:15 - 81:16)
[Music] (81:15 - 81:19)
elegant elegant (81:16 - 81:22)
elegant elegant little again (81:19 - 81:24)
those little against always get in my (81:22 - 81:26)
way on the combi island (81:24 - 81:27)
hate them (81:26 - 81:30)
unless it's ready then it's zombies (81:27 - 81:32)
i'm gonna actually pull an email real (81:30 - 81:34)
quick (81:32 - 81:36)
uh because i said i was going to and i (81:34 - 81:37)
didn't (81:36 - 81:39)
remind myself (81:37 - 81:41)
uh this is from andreas (81:39 - 81:43)
they said hi guys english is not my (81:41 - 81:46)
first uh language please excuse my (81:43 - 81:47)
mistakes (81:46 - 81:49)
uh also this is like (81:47 - 81:52)
better well it's more (81:49 - 81:53)
your english is better than mine but (81:52 - 81:54)
that's what i'm gonna say (81:53 - 81:59)
it's a low bar as you like to say ah (81:54 - 81:59)
we can rename the show to a low bar (81:59 - 82:03)
uh i just want to give my two cents on (82:01 - 82:06)
the new forms uh in the past situation (82:03 - 82:07)
that greg was talking about the latest (82:06 - 82:09)
episode that was actually two weeks ago (82:07 - 82:11)
uh just a quick background i am as a (82:09 - 82:13)
historian working in a museum let me (82:11 - 82:15)
start with this greg asked why we have (82:13 - 82:17)
no written information on forms that (82:15 - 82:19)
appear in the old cino uh from all latin (82:17 - 82:21)
texts ever (82:19 - 82:24)
written we have about one percent of it (82:21 - 82:27)
uh all the others didn't survive the (82:24 - 82:29)
ages a fire can destroy a whole library (82:27 - 82:31)
a flood as well sinnoh is close to a (82:29 - 82:33)
volcano an eruption would have had (82:31 - 82:36)
massive effects on the ecosystem (82:33 - 82:38)
famines would also happen in that time (82:36 - 82:40)
and people didn't care about written (82:38 - 82:42)
records on the topic of famines in (82:40 - 82:44)
general only small adaptive species that (82:42 - 82:48)
need little food to survive little food (82:44 - 82:50)
would survive a famine evolutions like (82:48 - 82:52)
weird deer that is big and needs tons of (82:50 - 82:54)
food with struggle so i can definitely (82:52 - 82:57)
see why especially i can definitely see (82:54 - 82:59)
why some evolutions would go extinct (82:57 - 83:01)
evolution on top of that is just an (82:59 - 83:03)
adaptation of a specific location the (83:01 - 83:05)
pokemon it is in in the his region and (83:03 - 83:07)
the central region are very very (83:05 - 83:09)
different a pokemon might not just not (83:07 - 83:10)
be able to evolve anymore as soon as the (83:09 - 83:13)
region is inhabited by humans maybe the (83:10 - 83:14)
lack of untouched wildlife and (83:13 - 83:17)
deforestat deforestation leads to less (83:14 - 83:20)
predators therefore basklin tend to die (83:17 - 83:21)
less when traveling upstream and (83:20 - 83:23)
therefore it cannot evolve because it (83:21 - 83:26)
needs the souls of dead basculin lastly (83:23 - 83:28)
the roman emperor caesar when he (83:26 - 83:31)
conquered uh germania (83:28 - 83:33)
or maybe just germ (83:31 - 83:36)
is that germania (83:33 - 83:38)
when it's in latin yes (83:36 - 83:40)
uh wrote down a whole catalog of (83:38 - 83:43)
wildlife there some in which we cannot (83:40 - 83:45)
pinpoint down he also talked about a (83:43 - 83:47)
reindeer-esque creature with only one (83:45 - 83:49)
horn in the center of its head and about (83:47 - 83:51)
an animal that sounds a lot like an (83:49 - 83:53)
elephant my point is (83:51 - 83:55)
that it's un it's not unlikely that (83:53 - 83:57)
animals go extinct and written records (83:55 - 84:00)
get lost and even if we have a writer (83:57 - 84:01)
that might describe it in a way that (84:00 - 84:03)
modern humans cannot make the connection (84:01 - 84:05)
of what it was exactly meant maybe we (84:03 - 84:07)
have records of basketball library but (84:05 - 84:09)
we don't know about this one all the (84:07 - 84:10)
best andy (84:09 - 84:11)
uh please (84:10 - 84:13)
hard agree on the typing oh they they (84:11 - 84:16)
agree that the typings were (84:13 - 84:17)
there you go (84:16 - 84:19)
uh i mean yeah (84:17 - 84:21)
real world reasons sure this isn't the (84:19 - 84:23)
real world this is a game that has been (84:21 - 84:26)
like we remember we have statues of (84:23 - 84:28)
things that happened 3 000 years ago and (84:26 - 84:30)
we know exactly everything about them (84:28 - 84:32)
well that's because we have a dude from (84:30 - 84:34)
3 000 years ago who's still walking (84:32 - 84:36)
around (84:34 - 84:37)
i mean that's why i just like crazy (84:36 - 84:40)
stuff actually there are a ton of dark (84:37 - 84:42)
reasons like i i get how the real world (84:40 - 84:44)
works right i think the volcano thing is (84:42 - 84:45)
a really good (84:44 - 84:47)
i'm just my thing is is i (84:45 - 84:50)
my biggest thing about that was how are (84:47 - 84:51)
they going to basically say hey they (84:50 - 84:52)
went extinct (84:51 - 84:54)
and hey there was a cataclysmic world (84:52 - 84:56)
event that erased all the records (84:54 - 84:59)
i would accept that i'm more concerned (84:56 - 85:00)
that they just aren't going to answer (84:59 - 85:02)
the question i see i see at all does it (85:00 - 85:04)
just be like collect your pokemon we're (85:02 - 85:06)
not going to say why they never carried (85:04 - 85:08)
over to the future bye-bye (85:06 - 85:09)
[Music] (85:08 - 85:11)
yeah i mean (85:09 - 85:13)
if any video game company can get away (85:11 - 85:15)
with not explaining anything it's (85:13 - 85:18)
definitely them yeah um but i re like i (85:15 - 85:19)
like i said the thing that stood out was (85:18 - 85:22)
like oh yeah like you go through mount (85:19 - 85:25)
coronet a million times in sinnoh (85:22 - 85:27)
but that was at one point a volcano (85:25 - 85:30)
right i mean it still is a volcano yeah (85:27 - 85:33)
yeah but so is yellowstone (85:30 - 85:34)
park yeah (85:33 - 85:37)
super volcano although let's remember we (85:34 - 85:40)
all thought mount st helens was dead (85:37 - 85:44)
guess what it wasn't um (85:40 - 85:46)
oh that was a good email though it's a (85:44 - 85:49)
good email i i mean i get it like i know (85:46 - 85:50)
as a human (85:49 - 85:53)
how bad things happen i'm just hoping (85:50 - 85:55)
they have a better explanation then i (85:53 - 85:58)
guess they went extinct (85:55 - 85:58)
i mean they wrote a whole character (85:59 - 86:03)
named daisy (86:02 - 86:05)
and then years later asked what that (86:03 - 86:07)
character was for and mossida went oh i (86:05 - 86:10)
don't know (86:07 - 86:10)
he was the king of kalos he built the (86:10 - 86:15)
giant crystal death block as i (86:13 - 86:17)
frequently say it made sense in the (86:15 - 86:20)
original japanese yeah (86:17 - 86:21)
oh (86:20 - 86:23)
look they needed another character just (86:21 - 86:25)
like they needed basculin to be another (86:23 - 86:26)
fish (86:25 - 86:29)
boy i like x and y i want to go on the (86:26 - 86:31)
record saying i do really like x and y i (86:29 - 86:34)
just cannot stand (86:31 - 86:36)
the actual story in that game i like all (86:34 - 86:39)
of my children all of my pokemon game (86:36 - 86:40)
children i just like some more than (86:39 - 86:42)
others yeah (86:40 - 86:45)
like all parents (86:42 - 86:46)
uh pokemon of the week (86:45 - 86:50)
all right last week's pokemon referenced (86:46 - 86:52)
uh galler that i'm playing pokemon (86:50 - 86:55)
shield with my shiny bug team (86:52 - 86:57)
and there's this one pokemon that keeps (86:55 - 86:59)
showing up all over the place as a (86:57 - 87:02)
helper pokemon and it makes one noise (86:59 - 87:04)
when you listen to it but what's written (87:02 - 87:06)
on the screen is different than the (87:04 - 87:08)
noise it makes because it looks like (87:06 - 87:09)
it's trying to speak english to you when (87:08 - 87:12)
it tries um i mean it has a lot of (87:09 - 87:13)
characteristics (87:12 - 87:17)
that are similar to meow stick (87:13 - 87:18)
which has gender differences between the (87:17 - 87:22)
two pokemon there that's all you needed (87:18 - 87:25)
it's (87:22 - 87:25)
munchlax (87:26 - 87:29)
no (87:29 - 87:31)
it's (87:30 - 87:33)
indeedy (87:31 - 87:37)
indeedy it is indeed it's indeedy (87:33 - 87:40)
it doesn't have a shuffle icon so (87:37 - 87:42)
yeah (87:40 - 87:44)
i like indeedy all right (87:42 - 87:48)
i think it's cute i like it shiny too (87:44 - 87:50)
good competitively like what purpose it (87:48 - 87:54)
serves hips don't lie (87:50 - 87:54)
thick (87:54 - 87:58)
the boy indeedy looks angry and has the (87:56 - 88:01)
up hair the girl indeedy looks nice and (87:58 - 88:04)
has the down hair right yeah and then (88:01 - 88:06)
it's the opposite for meow stick the boy (88:04 - 88:08)
meow stick looks cute and friendly the (88:06 - 88:11)
girl meowstic looks angry yes (88:08 - 88:14)
uh and then the male one has inner focus (88:11 - 88:16)
and synchronize and then the female one (88:14 - 88:18)
has own tempo and synchronized and then (88:16 - 88:20)
they both have the same hidden ability (88:18 - 88:22)
which is the good one of psychic surge (88:20 - 88:24)
psychic surge which makes the the (88:22 - 88:26)
landscape psychic (88:24 - 88:30)
psychotrania on entry no more sucker (88:26 - 88:32)
punch or fake out with psychic terrain (88:30 - 88:34)
up (88:32 - 88:34)
good shiny too (88:35 - 88:40)
i i said that oh sorry (88:36 - 88:40)
indeed he shares the category with (88:40 - 88:44)
curlia and mesprit they're all known as (88:42 - 88:46)
the emotion pokemon (88:44 - 88:47)
and dd's the only pokemon to have (88:46 - 88:49)
different egg moves depending on i (88:47 - 88:50)
actually did not know that it's the only (88:49 - 88:52)
pokemon to have different egg moves (88:50 - 88:53)
depending on gender (88:52 - 88:55)
indeedy share similarities with meostic (88:53 - 88:56)
they're both known as psychic type (88:55 - 88:58)
pokemon with gender differences oh this (88:56 - 89:00)
is why was where we'll get his trivia (88:58 - 89:03)
from well no (89:00 - 89:04)
go right ahead (89:03 - 89:06)
um (89:04 - 89:08)
it's based on a layers what's a lot (89:06 - 89:11)
what's a lars is it spelled (89:08 - 89:14)
l-a-r-e-s (89:11 - 89:16)
guardian of deity and ancient roman (89:14 - 89:20)
religion never heard of that in my life (89:16 - 89:23)
this is just a person (89:20 - 89:23)
lares that's how they say it on (89:24 - 89:28)
wikipedia (89:26 - 89:30)
leires (89:28 - 89:30)
oh they're like minor deities that (89:35 - 89:39)
protected the house and stuff okay (89:36 - 89:41)
and it also may draw inspiration from (89:39 - 89:43)
brownies the household spirits from (89:41 - 89:45)
british folklore said to come out at (89:43 - 89:47)
night to perform domestic and farming (89:45 - 89:51)
tasks yep oh that's cute (89:47 - 89:51)
oh that looks like a goblin oh sub group (89:51 - 89:57)
goblin okay (89:54 - 89:57)
you gotta put some more brownies in your (89:59 - 90:04)
d d games greg uh excuse me i use (90:00 - 90:06)
brownies quite a bit you don't play in (90:04 - 90:08)
any of my dna games so how would you (90:06 - 90:10)
know uh (90:08 - 90:12)
in a monster of the week game that i (90:10 - 90:14)
wasn't even running as a player i (90:12 - 90:17)
brought in a brownie to to work in the (90:14 - 90:20)
bar that we all visited so it had better (90:17 - 90:20)
food (90:20 - 90:23)
i am so confused (90:20 - 90:25)
aren't brownies just like (90:23 - 90:27)
before they're girl scouts (90:25 - 90:30)
no (90:27 - 90:30)
well what's the next week's [ __ ] plan (90:30 - 90:36)
like most other regions in the poke (90:33 - 90:38)
earth the galler region has four fossil (90:36 - 90:41)
pokemon pokemon that have been restored (90:38 - 90:44)
from fossils unearthed within the region (90:41 - 90:47)
the gala region is differentiated though (90:44 - 90:48)
by the fact that none of its fossil (90:47 - 90:51)
pokemon evolves into or is an evolution (90:48 - 90:54)
from another pokemon (90:51 - 90:57)
this week's pokemon is a basic v and has (90:54 - 90:59)
two attacks the first attack does not do (90:57 - 91:01)
very much damage but if the defending (90:59 - 91:04)
pokemon is a v or gx that defending (91:01 - 91:06)
pokemon cannot attack during the (91:04 - 91:08)
opponent's next turn (91:06 - 91:11)
the second attack does a lot of damage (91:08 - 91:13)
enough to knock out a pokemon v if not a (91:11 - 91:15)
pokemon v-max (91:13 - 91:18)
but the attacking pokemon cannot attack (91:15 - 91:20)
during the next turn (91:18 - 91:22)
both of the cannot attack clauses can be (91:20 - 91:24)
worked around if you have a way to (91:22 - 91:27)
retreat the active pokemon and then (91:24 - 91:29)
return it to the active position during (91:27 - 91:31)
your turn (91:29 - 91:33)
in an earlier era this pokemon could (91:31 - 91:36)
potentially have worked with blastoise (91:33 - 91:39)
and keldeo (91:36 - 91:41)
there you go that's one for the tcg kids (91:39 - 91:46)
