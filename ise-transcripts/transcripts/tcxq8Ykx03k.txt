handcrafted anecdotes about my handcrafted life everything i do is hand crafted people who pay for this podcast who have no idea what that's about at all it's true they don't get the ads exactly i understand that everything's hand we need a hand i don't even have that ad this week also i got a tattoo and my arm hurts oh the blank [ __ ] is a bad boy now i'm moving into the bad boy territory just wait until now you you won't do it i won't do it handcrafted tattoos speaking of somebody who has tattoos will is here i was first yes yeah i survived i i i got to go to a minnesota wedding my first minnesota wedding yesterday my friend josh who listens to this program and i got to hang out with steve's future friend ryan for when steve starts playing commander yeah with me and greg and ryan and vince where was the wedding is it a destination new prague i i call that new prague i've heard people call it new preg but there was also somebody at the wedding who the name of the place was the next chapter vineyard and the person called it the next chapter vineyard i was like that's not how v is pronounced dude uh well we here in minnesota call it new prague new prague prague uh well that's pokemon news for you all y'all the plural of you all uh no the plural of y'all is all y'all exactly all y'all you all paul is already a flirt it's already a plural y'all is a combination of you and all it's a fusion coming to pokemon tcg uh let's let's just get in pokemon news uh the first bit of news here is blastoise is now available in pokemon unite this is off pokemon.com get ready to make a big splash in pokemon united as blastoise is now available to join your team this popular pokemon is a range defender uh and it will provide some useful support for your squad the pokemon will get begin the match as a squirtle evolve into a war total at five eight blastoise at level nine you can even make your blastoise look positively fancy with a fashionable style hollower blastoise basic attack will become a boosted attack with every third attack dealing continual damage and decreasing the movement speed of the pokemon for a short time blastoise ability torrent will cause its attack and special to attack to increase when the pokemon is at half hp or less that sounds very good um also it's one third in the games yes correct and then less than half technically still counts uh and then it talks about blastoise moves we don't have to go into here's the thing i i play there's a lot of character based games out there in the world overwatch uh apex final fantasy 14 destiny and final fantasy don't count because they're not introducing new characters well i guess final fantasy 14 is introducing like they introduce new classes there's new npcs all the time there's sometimes a new race like what are you talking about but apex and what was the first game i said oh overwatch dota league of legends they introduce characters and if they introdu the thought process is if they introduce a character that's not good then no one will buy it and they want to make money yeah it's character creep that's what happened yeah and so i know that this gets thrown around a lot but i'm gonna say that blastoise is op he's too good well that's the trick is they introduce blastoises op and then after people rising that is the that is the mmo way is it op or do people just not know how to deal with it yet so that one yeah that's what i wanted to talk about because people said zara oro was opie when zera aura came out and they did nerf zero aura zero zoro zera auras unite move that's the only thing they nerfed and i in the some however many games of unite i've played i've played a lot the first couple weeks i was like oh zara aura but unite move aside the thing that bothered me with zero aurora wasn't a unite move was its discharge but now i just know how to play against their aura you just like know that okay it's going to discharge okay it discharged i walked away from him so he can't discharge me and then you know that he has like whatever six seconds before he can do it again and that's when you get in close and yeah you mess him up wreck house so even though people screamed that zero oros op discharged specifically i don't think i like i i've never worry about playing against aurora i'm more worried about playing against like lucario lucario's super annoying well and that lucario is a hard counter to cramaran so that's part of my problem that's why you hate it so much um but blastoise is op specifically it's one move the shell spin rapid spin it lasts for it it lasts for eight seconds and you can't you can't do anything to him you can't put him to sleep you can't double slap him you can't hurricane him you can't he just spins what if i'm slow bro can i pick him up in the air nope he's unstoppable the entire time does he move or he's just one space no he he was bumper balling around the whole map it's incredibly good yeah but it's not targeted i mean it's only you can only target at the beginning so right if you don't aim right it's just going to bounce around and hit nobody i that i'm not sure i haven't i did play blastoise a little bit in the 3v3 or whatever but i didn't pick rapid spin i picked whatever the other move was that's why you're tilted because you picked the wrong move blastoise too good um and his outfit's dumb can we talk it's it's a bad outfit why is it a bad outfit because he's like okay because pikachu has a similar outfit it's like dapper pikachu with the not the i don't know what kind of hat it's like the easter hat like a top hat or yeah like a top hat but not like abraham lincoln top hat like more like a bowler more like a southern top hat what is it southern top what do you like is it a kentucky fried chicken no it's it's a standard straw boater hat it's the wide brim white short top it's not a top hat it's a boater hat it's a straw boater hat and he's also wearing a vest he is a he is a dapper suited summer suited blastoise what's wrong with it they like gave him that weird flower button it looks bad like a boutonniere no he's like button but not as best as a flower instead of just a button yeah why is that right that green is a bad color it's a bad grain why is it a bad green it's not a good green what's a good green not that i bought blastocyst with my coins uh i don't like i don't he's fine i don't like playing him he's fine i like defenders you only like crammer you only like attackers um i like i think i like slow bro more as a defender i do like crammer and a lot i like the aoes [Laughter] yeah that's why i can't exactly yeah cinderella i have to aim and i'm always going to miss my aim and then i say you lose you just leave you just leave whirlwind traps around and hope somebody falls into them oh they always do greg they always do are we still playing unite well gave up on it right i didn't give up on it it's just none of my friends want to play with me anymore so i had to play by myself oh did the smash brother thing happen everyone got good and you didn't no everybody went back to dota and league they're like yeah that was a diversion now let's back go back to the real esports uh i haven't played in a week because i've been playing wildermuth which is a very good game what oh geez i will say this i within the first week of the game i got my three items that i use wise glasses shell bell buddy barrier literally it's every like pokemon we're not even gonna we're not gonna talk about pokemon.com put out an article of like held items on pokemon every single one has buddy barrier there's not a single pokemon on that list that doesn't have buddy barrier so like the first week of the game i got all my items up to 20. didn't pay any money just like grinded the tickets saved the tickets and it's helpful that i only play like one character right like if you're playing like three characters and you're like well well they all have buddy barrier but this one has focus band and this one has the shell bell and like that's what my problem is and i got all the way up to ultrarank with all my items at 20 and then i lost all to rank and then i was like you know what i have like 7 000 tickets because i'm a hoarder and i was like i'm gonna bring up my wise classes and there is this has already been proven on like youtube and whatnot there's a huge difference in your held items or not your held items yeah held items and when i went from 20 to 25 on wise glasses oh i was surfing all over the map yep i was destroying yep and it it's just like oh this is how so many people got to master ranks so fast like it actually it like actually like and i would i want to say it actually matters literally and figuratively because a lot of the times and i've i have all my matches recorded you can go to my twitch but a lot of the times you would see oh that pokemon had one hp left bummer if only i did one percent more damage and they died instead of me dying that's a whole sway in a match like if it if it's like two verse two and they kill you before you kill them now it's now your teammate is one verse two and then your teammate dies and they don't and they get the experience for killing you and they're still alive and they still have map area and so like when i was like uh for so many matches like ah they lived with one oh they lived with one oh that's a they lived with one hp and then i went up to 25 instead of 20. now now i am the one living on one i told y'all like what three weeks ago that i hit the paywall while real hard where you it you cannot deny that that makes a huge difference like now you're 100 correct yes and i had it i had to step away because i was super frustrated for a bit i'm like i just need to like i just need to recalibrate my feelings about the game uh so i stepped away because of the pay to win aspect of it and i don't think there's a ton of people who are like oh it's just pay to advance like it's cutting hairs like you advance through winning i mean at a certain point like yeah i mean at like a certain point i guess if people continue to play this game and maybe if they only play one character yeah the like if you got to master rank this season which ends in like two weeks you will get 20 000 tickets and 20 000 tickets will take any item from zero to 30 for free um and if you're if you've gotten like 300 or 400 games you could probably take one item to 30 for free but that's still after what this game came out in july yeah so that's still it's like still not three items to 30 for free it's like two and a half in a year in a year and then they'll introduce new items yep i really hope they get rid of th this aspect of the game but i don't think they will i mean league did eventually eventually league had the same system i mean it took them a while so i don't perceive this anytime in the future i'm just waiting for mamo swine like i'm i i want to try blastoise but like i'm waiting for mammoth i'm waiting for mama swine they already announced it i want it period there's also a like a glitch in the game right now like the last update and yeah there's like a something specifically with crustal and a jump pad and it's very i i don't know what it is crustal is too heavy for the doug trio to push yep yeah you have to sell smash so that you're lighter to use the dump head properly what you're doing anyways because you're jungle crystal and you're running around in jungle at top max speed because you sell smashed and you murder things that is why jungle crustal is the best crystal the yeah i don't know how like obviously the meta of unite has changed like the very first week of the game no one wanted to do dreadnought everyone ignored dreadnaught everyone was like dreadnought was a waste of time and then like two weeks in people were like row time is the waste of time stop doing like we all do dreadnought now and it's like to the point where the meta is who cares about top lane get dreadna yeah which is and now now and and the first couple weeks were also like oh zapdos is more important now i feel like no one even does that just now i feel like everyone's just so focused on dreadnought and then like there's this weird panic when zapdos comes and no one does it except the tough part is if you if your team can get two dreadnaughs you have such an xp level boost like you have such an advantage at that point it's really hard to like like it's really hard for the other team to catch up even with zapdos like it's not impossible but it is difficult like if you've lost both dreadnoughts and heaven forbid you lose a third like you just you aren't coming back from like that huge of a xp gap right and before somebody's like well that's when you have to go for zapdos and it's like yeah but they're they're all two levels above you and they're gonna be waiting at zapdos they'll be waiting at zapdos they'll come in and kill or they'll wait and they'll come in and wipe you out and snipe it like the level difference of getting two dreadnoughs is huge it's not impossible to overcome like each like sure yeah you can easily throw a match hey i've seen i've seen like um oh you got your hoopa finally hey i got my hoopa like 40 minutes ago i shouldn't have told you guys about hoop but now you're like desperate i ain't desperate for nothing i got three hoopas and pokemon home bank whatever it's called i don't need any more hoopas they're too mischievous i i i have seen some like top unite players talk about how the state of the game is not good specifically because jungle is just so broken not i don't know if bro that's the word they used i don't know if i broke it in what way it just has so much more experience than everything else oh yeah and i i personally feel like it it's not zapdos it's not dreadna it's how good is your jungler yeah i mean a good jungler will help although like if we start the match and no one knows who's jungling even though because no one like because we're i'm still in ultra rank and people don't know what like people still are not just saying what lane they're doing so it's like i know well there's a there's there's a guard chomp and there's this froakie which one is going just going either neither one said they're going jungle and then all of a sudden neither of them like we lost like no one's going to jungle we lost and then it's like or it's the other way where both the froakie and the the guard chomp are in general it's like we lost you broke up the experience too much yeah and or you do have like a score bunny that decides to go jungle and and they're not in there long enough and it's like will you miss this core fish you missed that dude like what are you what we lost because you're not like i i think you're being very jungle blamey right now especially since you don't like jungle cram you don't like jungle crush you don't like jungle blissy you don't you have such narrow views of what is appropriate for what the jungle is how about you expand and say hey i'm jungle cram now nobody wants him in the jungle i have i have last minute jungle cram twice because no one else has opted for jungle and we won both those games there's a lot of experience yeah that's what i'm saying like if you expanded your limited view of who could go into the jungle you would be master rink right now that's i i should just turn signal jungle every time uh i do i do think united is in a slightly weird place well it's the first season of the game just coming out like it's gonna be in a weird place for a bit oh yeah yeah there's no way they could have perfected it straight out the gate also they're still introducing characters like yeah they have also a long way to go before they get to a settled this is this is what we want they also did the thing where they like buffed xspeed and they buffed goal getter and they nerfed um eject button eject button and everybody still uses his jackpot everyone's still using it because it's still better at a 20-second delay than any of your other garbage items ah i don't even know what the smoke thing does i try to use it once and it does nothing i still don't know what goal getter does i mean goal getter if you're a scorer goal getter cuts down the amount of time that it takes for you to score so like for i think score shield seems so good anyways yeah well like for gardevoir whose goal animation is five years it helps a little bit but it's still not as good as the others um yeah uh you know anyways i should get back to unite next week united is free to play you have like 20 days left of the season no 14 days left of the season if you want that syndra's scandal i know i get to do that i got it i'm so close i just had to take a break because wilder meth is so good uh this is also off pokemon.com watch the trailer for pokemon evolutions a new animated series exploring the many regions of the pokemon world in this new limited series coming september 9th the pokemon world has a variety of regions filling with interesting people and wonderful pokemon evolutions a new limited did they have something already called evolutions i thought so i think so we had origin we had evolutions was there like 20 part series each one was like two minutes long was that not evolution no generation generation i think uh this uh this will take you on a tour of the regions that have been explored in the core pokemon video game series here's the debate between core and main series the first episode premieres on september 9th you can watch the trailer right here trailer produced to celebrate 25 years of pokemon this eight episode series will begin in the gala region and uh end in the kanto region the first region that appeared in the series each episode has familiar characters connecting the thread of a pikachu that leads viewers on their journey voyage through the region so september 9th will be called the champion featuring galler obviously that has to do with leon september 23rd will be the eclipse featuring alola but that has to do with lily october 7th will be the vision in the kalos region that maybe after x amount of years they've finally figured out what lysander was trying to do the entire uh it's looker vision looker it's all about looker no it's about lysander it's about lysander do you think they'll be like hey maybe we should maybe try to justify why a z existed no a z existed for a lot of good reasons one of them was he built a crystal flower exactly and that's all you need from him he made a terrible mistake that he was cursed to immortal immortality and giganticism for and could not find peace for 3 000 years until his dark creation the crystal bloom cannon flower of death was destroyed yes and his eternal flowet also returned decided to come back and be like uh it's been three thousand years i guess you're forgiven man the end of that game still bothers me why why i i had still strongly dislike saving the world then beating the elite four and then this joker showing up after the credits being like let's battle no let's not it's my time now not yours get out of here he is the king of kalos that's what he was the king of i hate that they did that in sun and moon too they were like hey here's the credits okay now go catch cat tapu coco no let me do i will catch this pokemon in my own time they did it right in sword and shield they did it right at sword and shield you beat the game you end up in your house they're like hey you want to go do that post game it's over here in the forest but hey don't no no rush no rush i don't want to be pushed and i definitely don't want to do another battle after i became champion dude did you not are you not watching that are you not watching the parade i just crushed dianda are the new champion you must defend your title to any challenger not during my parade at any time no you didn't do anything get off the carpet dance somewhere what else you didn't save the world i did and i cried was part of it yeah yeah not part of it who was down there beating pitbull me and serena not tierno pierno was clear in the way with his sweet dance moves yes and you needed that on that bridge to give you the boost to get to the elite four and you know it all i'm saying is if mr worldwide mr 365 mr pitbull is not in the vision it's a terrible series that's what i'm really saying also to anyone not knowing pitbull is in the callous region you have to battle him like twice before you get to virtual boy lysander he's down there i promise it is not pitbull it is mr worldwide okay december 2nd it's october they would have to pay a lot of money to put that person in the game they did not put them into the game it is a million people october 21st it was actually bad bunny yeah the plan featuring the unova region that would have to do with obviously end and gets us uh december 2nd is the rival featuring the center that's the best they could do for sinnoh the rival no one cares about you barry everybody loves barry and everybody owes barry a million dollars okay barry is fine you is the best rival who is just your angsty self you only like you because you're like yeah that's like me with an attitude a chain wallet nothing better to do than you would run around and work you would have the chain wall if we're taking all the rivals hughes chain wallet for [ __ ] yeah you identify with you that's why you think it's the best you're like yeah that dude's cool wait no no no no uh lily's brother what's his name gladion daddy on he's chainwall yeah he doesn't have a chain wallet because he knows that fat died and should stay in the 90s where it belongs uh hoenn region is titled the wish is that is that latios latias is we're getting another kiss scene here let's know oh it is probably jirachi actually but jirachi's from sinnoh no no it's on are you man oh gracious uh december 16th the show from the johto region and then december 23rd the quest from the cantor region so it looks like there's two weeks in between all these episodes they're these are like three minutes long right there's no they're like five yeah it seems fine it seems exciting i'm sure that'll be fine all the little one-off things they do are always fun and good yeah yeah like i'm always into them so i'm imagining these will be just as good like it's always fun when they like just get away from the main anime storyline and like hey let's play stuff off the video games and they always do a pretty you know some are better than others but generally i enjoy watching them and now i can watch them on my twitch on my switch on your switch or my tv yeah they this has been like a recurring theme i feel like they're like every every like two years we need a new mini series everybody loves the mini series i mean it's true i like them i mean i i i guess you keep do i mean they keep getting like a million two million views on youtube so i guess you keep doing them except they don't get that ad money on youtube so i don't maybe the engagement's more important than the ad money do they need the ad money they definitely do not need the ad price but it never hurts um there was a cleaning event in sword and shield this past weekend altaria rotom chinchino wimpod they come to max raid they were in max raid battles uh chinchino could be shiny they continue badly advertising these uh do we know why it was cleaning weekend cleaning it's spring cleaning it's packing everything up and hiding inside like is there something going to say hey janine what's the theme this year she's like i need to clean my apartment cleaning theme it is wait is it like moon festival maybe maybe you think they're gonna i bet they're i bet they bring back the pumpkaboo one right i don't think [Music] yeah i mean or they could do the things were very popular we could do it spooky forest yeah the pro the problem everything's a problem on this show the actual pro the actual problem with these raid events are if you've stopped playing sword and shield you've stopped the grind and if you are out of wishing peace's last raid event and you haven't played since this sounds like a personal problem that you had are you still playing sword shield me yeah yeah i play every day what why are you giving me that look what are you doing in it uh i am trying to hatch a shiny uh soloist and i will run around and collect all my wishing pieces and then a friend of mine will say hey i have a shiny raid dead do you want to do it and i'll say yes i do and then i play and get my shiny and then i put it away thank you pieces to begin with you're just freeloading off other people hey it's not freeloading when they also get the den and they need my help to complete it and i am very thankful to them uh yeah i haven't been playing i haven't played sword shield like a month i visit honeycomb island c every day kill as many combi as i can just get that shiny female combi someday and in shield i'm playing the actual game with my all shiny bug team i almost wait i just defeated koga with an all shiny bug team that is not the easiest thing in the world he does use a firebug much as i used a firebug against him not the same cop i think he said koga i did i just they they both start with k i was like yeah i was like wait you're doing uh well and he said bugs too i was like yeah he has that sick venom off now yeah between and then i had uh it's still a larvesta but there you go between uh unite and doing my ribbon quest there has been minimum minimal little to no sword and shield you're missing out because well you should do a sword and shield day once a day and just say hey i'm going to collect all my stuff so that the next surprise apple picking day so september will be apple picking weekend and it'll be appleton got it and so get prepped get your things and it's going to be the weekend that pokemon go community day is so be prepared you know now that you said that you're probably probably right actually uh okay let's take a break when we come back we got some more news to talk about and we will be right back all right chat it's our last pack this is evolving skies could be good can't get any worse than what we've already pulled that's not true it could we could end with like a worm pole fletchling dirt skip loom ursa ring rock and rolla bergmite nickit lillipup hippopotas reverse hollow rock and rolla and oh my gosh it was red lose my mind [Music] does that save the box i think that saves the box right i think we did it it was all we just had to complain for 20 minutes look at that [Music] psa 10 question mark question mark question mark where's my sleeves oh gosh i think i'm out of sleeves actually i think i used my last where's that and we are back from our break let's talk about pokemon go okay what are we talking about why because all the exciting news about our trip to visit uh that place that's south of me and you greg oh yes yeah so this was kind of dropped out of nowhere ah maybe not out of nowhere they kind of hinted at it earlier this summer what in one of those secret meetings that you get invited to that we don't get invited to no no the the like well they're not secret well they're kind of are we invited to them no do you tell us about them beforehand no yeah good call greg so he's always like his secret meeting they are telling you about you you text us about the most random garbage and yet you never once said hey guess what i get to do today i'm going to a niantic meeting so therefore it's a secret i'm not weird flexing my niantic that's how secrets work a weird flexing to the people who know you do this how is that a weird flex i mean you make it weird because you make everything weird that is the truest thing i've heard all day okay this is pokemon go live trainers we know how meaningful and rewarding it is to collect and explore in the real world through our live events that's why we're excited to announce the safari zone events originally planned for 2020 safari go pokemon go safari zone liverpool is now scheduled for friday october 15th through sunday october 17th in cephtron park pokemon go safari's on philadelphia is now scheduled from friday october 29th through sunday october 31st in fairmount park and pokemon go safari zone st louis is now scheduled friday november 12th through sunday november 14th in tower grove park additionally the start and end times from safari zone have shifted one hour earlier to provide the best possible on-site experience that's probably because of daylight savings time no that's in december uh i think weren't they originally more in the summer though yeah no so st louis was gonna be march it was march okay it was the end of march i think it was at the same park or is this a new park i don't know this is the same park tower grove is the same not only will the safari zone celebrations take place in their original park locations but ticket holders will be able to participate in the event if they if they have a ticket no matter where they are around the world

requirement for all staff members uh when you are planning your safari zone experience please follow health guides and pay attention to any travel restrictions if these events must be postponed again during government guidance or from local authorities we will notify ticket holders as soon as possible so there's there's a lot here um so i want to just disclose that i i did pay for my own safari zone st louis ticket so did greg so did will i will disclose that niantic did pay for my philadelphia plus my explorer pass ticket um because i was in talks with niantic during this time too and then obviously now i talk to niantic on a pretty regular basis as we've learned from this podcast where i say niantic is paid for my ticket so i just want to get that out there just to be clear um so i think they did a lot of things right although there's still a lot of questions here so i think the things they did right is like hey we're doing these events if you don't want to go you can just play at home i think that's cool yeah i think i think it's cool that they they did try to give us makeup events last year and i think some people who didn't buy tickets are pretty salty about this that we got an event last year that we could play at home and then we got another event this year but i think overall that's like the right choice like we didn't know how long the pandemic was gonna last it was a bummer it was a bummer to get your events canceled so niantic doing something to be like hey i know this really sucks you probably got multiple events canceled so let's try to do something to instate some goodwill i mean when you sent this hey like hey the safari thing is back on i literally had completely forgotten this was a thing me too i was like the what oh right we were supposed to do a thing yeah five years ago i i i think this was the uh the worry all along is like hey if we reschedule this just because you had off back in 2020 for this event doesn't like i don't have off friday october 29th through the 31st i am literally moving to a whole different state that day so this was kind of the worry we talked about last year is like yeah yeah they have to reschedule of course like a bunch of concerts had to reschedule a bunch of other uh irl events had to reschedule but if you bought something a year ago a lot changes in a year like then sometimes you just have life events that you can't yep do the other the worry about the st louis one is it's five days before diamond and pearl come out like do i want to be in another state when i could be like prepping for this big game release coming out it's very like i'm curious if the reason they were like hey let's we we're let's do it before the end of the year is because one of these three venues were like we're not going to give you your money back if you don't do the event and they're like well i don't think all three of them said that but i bet one of those three locations were like if you don't do your event by the end of the year you don't get your security position i guarantee having talked to people who had this exact thing happen with weddings yes they were told okay we're you're at the you're at the end you either need to do it or there's we're not refunding you and uh yeah if one if one of these cities put pressure on them i'm sure they were just like well let's just do all three liverpool yeah probably liverpool um we've we've been talking the three of us we're probably going to go to the st louis one yeah i would say this is easier we're all at that point we'll all be in the same place so going and coming back will be a lot easier but also we already we have tickets for st louis yeah and i was the only one that had tickets to philadelphia correct right and you can't get tickets now right so i i i could actually probably get you guys tickets but we i'm moving i keep so we can't go anyways it's a stretch uh that we're not applying to england i i i think if eve even if i could even if niantic was like yeah here's two extra tickets it's way easier for us just because we would have we're driving to st louis that was the plan yep because it's like a six hour you and greg have a nice trip i'll see you there the plan was to drive um [Music] i feel we were pax is happening this weekend and looking at people like i they they're checking vaccine vaccine cards you have to wear a mask i'm it looks to be somewhat well run i think the reason i i still well obviously we didn't go to pax we're here we're here um i feel like an outdoor event feels better an outdoor event is better let's be real i mean pax is rolling the dice hardcore and they're taking every precaution that they can they are still rolling the this is the person that went to the state fair this year twice so like i know that i'm taking a risk going to large in-person events granted much of the safer as outdoors and i was wearing my mask all the time but a lot of people weren't like it is a risk it is a risk to do any of this but outdoor is x amount safer than indoor here's why i feel good about it st louis specifically they they sold x amount of tickets right we don't know how many they sold and they said you don't have to come yeah so i would wager to bet that at least 25 percent of people are already through in the towel and we're like we're not i'm not going well at home like i had to rearrange like i don't even know if i can get this time off like i wasn't sure i had vacation time i had not planned on it i had to clear it like it's not a lot of warning to say in september we're doing it in november especially for travel like it's it's not a great amount of lead time i i can make it work but i bet you a lot of people can't also november in the midwest ain't particularly warm yeah it's it's either going to be 70 degrees or it's going to be 20 degrees yeah let's go in between in november the midwest normal fall or we're head long into winter like we have no idea what the weather's going to be like at that time framing yeah also like we have to deal with hotel we have to deal with like a lot of things and staying in hotels it's also like weird it's a year later and you don't get to re-pick your i get it you don't get to re-pick your day though so like yeah in the situation for philadelphia if i don't remember if i had a friday saturday or sunday if i had a friday i could be like well i can at least play it at home if i have the saturday ticket i'm literally in a moving truck for six hours that day like yeah there ain't no plan on saturday wait a minute i thought i was driving the moving truck well we'll be oh i'll be in the car behind the moving truck i will be here baking cookies to welcome you oh i'm in front of the moving truck no not the way you drive buddy oh moving truck will be doing 85 miles an hour let's see the movie i'm in front of the movie truck will's driving me off the road yeah you are you are in the dust let's be real you're going to say goodbye to your possessions your extra car you're just going to see like the streak get me out of here will in a moving truck name a more powerful duo i'm like a shell smash crustle on those roads yeah moving trunk will the new op i i know some people are upset that they're not selling more tickets it's probably more complicated than that like if look how many times have they messed up tickets for for [Music] other events i think it's probably like we just need to get these done let's not try to get more like this is i don't think it's about making money no i think it's like we just well i mean i think it's about not losing i think it's about not losing money it is about it is about loss and not about gain yes as somebody uh i i once heard talk about their job when they were um basically anti shoplifting uh loss prevention management yep i'm sure they already have like since last year i'm sure they have like standees and and irl things that say st louis or pittsburgh philadelphia um that they're just going to set up they're going to use hopefully it'll be an okay weekend and then they throw all that out and then they we did it we did it and maybe next year they can do safari zones properly fingers crossed uh not sure let's let's hope i'm curious i'm super curious i think it's easy for uh enough for us to jet down to st louis spend the night do the day jet back and then we have something to talk about i enjoy how he describes an eight-hour drive yeah you know get down i mean we're not spending the weekend in st louis uh i mean it's st louis what's there to do good hamburgers at that one restaurant yeah visit people uh hey they want to visit st louis they can come to tower grove park or whatever it's called but they don't have to take it for the day that we're on i don't even know what day we're on there's no way that there's no way any of these events are going to be fenced in it's going to be like um go fest in chicago it wasn't fenced in you just had the the virtual ticket gave you the spawns or whatever i think it's fine i think they're trying uh i mean this is coming off of the communication news that they posted we don't we don't have to go too much in this i covered this on my stream but september 1st we heard from you update from our task force pretty much what's going to happen here pretty much obviously we the 80 we talked about this last week the 80 is um permanent not 40. also some clarification here uh 80 meters is 80 meters from you to the stop ah so i was right so will was right it's it's a diameter not a radius yes diameter not radiance right i mean it's a radius radius making it worse it is a radius uh they apologize so so they're they're september 1st we we heard you was we wanted to roll out the 80. we messed up we apologize we're not going to go by country by country basis like they tried to do with new zealand and the united states are going to treat the whole world as one which i can see both sides to that um and then they said they're going to start publishing a developer diary every other month so six times a year first one will be october they're gonna keep setting up regular conversations with community leaders uh which at this point you guys know that i've am one of these community leaders there's no webs like prior to this happening niantic didn't want us to talk about this which was kind of weird so when i was like hey when if if i talk to you guys and you say something and then i talk to my audience what do you how do you want me to frame that and they're like well just treat it like a news source like if ign contacted us ign would stay we talked to niantic and i was like yeah i guess that makes sense but now that you're using the words community leaders maybe you should list who they are i don't know it doesn't care it doesn't matter it's really dumb though hey we're talking with these people we don't know who they are we don't know who they are um we will continue to work uh we will continue to work and update the known issue pages so the known issue pages has always been around i have probably been to it like twice maybe three times in the last five years i don't know how often it was getting updated but when i checked it it said last updated september 1st so um yeah i and i think i think overall this is the thing i wanted more than the distance was you guys just need to talk to us better like if you're if if you're going to change something and then not say why you're just letting your audience wildly speculate and the audience is always going to be like it's because of money uh so uh this this was a good start though i mean like they they they didn't really come out in this letter and have a bunch of excuses it was pretty much we messed up we're sorry we'll do better and i don't know what else you would want from that i mean a lot of apologies feel really hollow or really like we're sorry we got caught apologies i mean this is a step above that sure yeah yeah i mean that's a low bar it's a low bar and they are making material changes and they are actually making changes right like the the two things that they needed to do was like hey we messed up and we fixed it like i don't need much more from the apology than that like yeah uh i mean i mean i am excited to see what happens going forward like i don't necessarily trust them because i don't tend to trust any corporation but i am curious what their plan is how these developer things are going to be like what is the deal yeah i i hope that there are not but it's it's not like i i'm desperate for new features but it would be it would be nice if things that were annoying in the game were resolved so not necessarily like bug fixes but there are mechanics in the game that just feel very outdated did you or did you not get socks you know we did finally get socks that's true so why wasn't that at the top of the news i think that pokemon unite team really lit a fire under their butt look at all look at all our socks go we can chuck it on top song no longer relevant finally finally it's happened to me we got socks it go and i'm so very excited i like kind of knew that song but then i lost it ah last last bit of news here we're not gonna do super news every week this is not a super news heavyweight it is the worst anniversary ever we're getting a series that starts later we got another ep nothing else and then december 24th is gonna hit and our minds will be hey can i can i just say this evolving skies not good did the skies not evolve these sets are too big i'm not gonna like poke they cut 90 pokemon out of it yeah and it's still too big 250 cards you're not gonna like this week's pokemon of the week then oh boy all right last bit of news here off pokemon.com pokemon club the after school pokemon club is now live in partnership with the american association of school librarians pokemon offers fun in-person educational adventures for students students looking for the opportunity to complete flex their strategy and reasoning skills and dive into the wonderful world of pokemon are in for a treat the american association of school librarians a diversion division of the american library association has partnered with the with pokemon to present the after school pokemon club with this program that students can enjoy the camaraderie and education because an extra r in there camaraderie and education i need a two-line didn't read i'm signing up for this club because my reading comprehension is awful um after school pokemon clubs will meet once a week for an hour participating students will have access to tools to learn how to play the pokemon trading card game episodes of the series to watch and other fun activities and resources students if you're interested in having the after school pokemon club at your school please talk to your local school librarians librarians and school coordinators to form an after-school pokemon club at your school obtain information by visiting this link i mean we're still back in like the 90s wasn't it it was a thing every decade there is always something going on was it pokemon related earlier no was there a pokemon related club thing probably oh this form is like really advanced i mean my elementary school had an after-school like pokemon tcg club that we used to go to to play pokemon tcg holy cow can i read this question so faq on this uh american association of school librarians em i am a middle school librarian can i apply i'm not making this up it literally says yes and no periods yep what before applying we would ask to confirm your students interest in administrator support aasl understands that there is fluidity between grade levels and a wide variety of learning levels activity interests and skill levels wait why would they okay so yes and no what why do what did you say wait where are you finding this faq you have to click the american association of libraries i did and i'll say no faq scroll down here i'll link it already are they are they saying that like okay so they did say like anime and i'm sure there's like worksheets i mean you can see the worksheets here there's like a coloring there's like a bingo there's like a cutout so the issue is but the pokemon trading card game is like very advanced like there's a lot of math there's learning there's like like chess i mean chess club's the thing but this isn't trading card game this is uh other but the issue is in some places middle school is like fifth fifth sixth no no no some places it's like fifth grade through ninth grade yeah some places it's only seventh and eighth grade so like different places called middle school different things so that's why in one school district i went to middle school was seven eight nine yeah i moved districts it was only seven eight and there's another district where it's six seven eight so like i was six seven eight varies wildly but i would say middle schoolers and the pokemon trading card game is a good but this isn't trading card game but they did say that they said it on the pokemon web page i mean it says after school will meet once a week for an hour participating students will have tools to learn to play the pokemon trading card game episodes of the series to watch and other fun activities and resources there's other stuff as well i think it's the other activities and resources yeah that are it says recommended age is between six to ten how old are you in fifth grade eleven ten eleven uh fifth grade ten ten to eleven fourth grade is definitely ten or nine nine to ten nine to ten look at kindergarten first grade is like six i don't know i feel like maybe like if you don't want a huge focus on the tcg then you probably shouldn't lead with the tcg in your like after school activities it was like literally your first bullet point because the tcg can be really complicated i ran a tcg weekly club thing official play organized you fill out the professor form you pick up go to a retail establishment say hey can i do pokemon cards every wednesday night here i did all that it was a nightmare let me tell you it was like kids i don't dislike kids no you don't dislike them you actively yeah no no no no i've seen you walk up to a child eating an ice cream cone and knock it out of their hand and go point at them and go i i like teaching people how to do stuff educational but you're so bad at it oh my gosh you're the worst i will sit like i am the i am the i'm the greg don't you shake your head i'm the one reading the real rule book and i'm like teaching the rules yeah you read the rule book the amount of times that i've learned a game wrong from you i have about 50 50. never taught you a game ryan he always leaves something out i have never had an experience of trying to teach me something without him leaving one and he's like oh i just assumed you would have figured that part no teaching is not about assuming buddy i teach for a living i should teach the things either way here's the thing the starter decks the starter decks are designed to be simple to play that's what the intent of this is sure these parents would come to this hobby lobby or hobby hobbytown jesus wow you're doing it at a hobby lobby store just it up a couple of miles get out christians we're here now we're playing our satan pokemon game over here over here aisle four and aisle four i was at a hobby town and these parents would come and they would drop their kid there was two types of parents there was the parents that would show up they would drop their kid off and they would say i'll see you in an hour and the kids would always be the same they so wait hold on let me break this down into like a family tree so two types of parents so branching one is parent that drops a little timmy off so either little timmy would play the game for like 10 minutes and then just browse the aisles of the the hobbytown for the next 50 minutes that's what i would do or the little timmy would sit and just continue to cheat for the hour so or you have parent number two which shows up and they stay and they read a book or they're on their ipad for the hour and their kids were significantly more well behaved than the parent one which was like i'm just gonna trust my kid here at a hot like uh what now at the hobbytown i was we had a lot of like people my age as well um but no one wanted to play with like that ten-year-olds babysitters it was it it was a nightmare to run that and it was a lot more work than just like i just want a place to play pokemon every wednesday night [Laughter] your own selfish desires brought you to this end yeah what i'm saying is i don't think i could ever be an elementary school teacher no this is 100 correct yes you are correct nor could you be an elementary school librarian that seems less stressful no no you gotta figure out which kid stole what book off the shelf when they are out of options they go to the library and harass the librarian uh it's cool that they're doing this i'd i'd be curious of how successful it will be i feel like well i went to mps so any of these things that'd be a hard no from every like they don't want extra work they don't get paid enough to host some pokemon club usually you get paid extra if you do an extracurricular money yeah yeah really yeah it's one of the few ways they can bump up that salary a little bit oh i didn't know that interesting what about so if you're the librarian and you're like i'm going to host the pokemon club you get a little something something too i mean it's a standard if you host an extracurricular you get 50 extra dollars a month question of the week already all right yeah gee mini hold on it's the 25th anniversary there's no news i know i didn't know that that was the last bit of news like the last bit of news i thought you were holding something reserved all right ready no we ended on the librarian what is the question of the week what is the question of the week all right from our slack this is from ninja turtle raph what newer quality of life improvements would you like to see be added to the diamond and pro remakes that's a good question be able to switch out the pokeball you can't have the same answer that is not quality of life how is that not a quality of life yeah it is i have to breed to get it and i can't breed my starters into the ball that i want that is a quality of life improvement that is you know you know i still buy them you know why that will never happen because the pokeball factory isn't kalos no because the one time that one guy cheated and the only way they could tell was because it was in a dream ball and that pokemon could there's like no way it could have been in a dream ball so they're like oh wow yeah but that's out like yeah that was one that was ray rizzo too they didn't even disqualify him uh quality of life um i mean we we are assuming hms are out otherwise if not i want atms out uh yeah i mean that would be mine is like if there's hms i'm going to still attempt to enjoy the game but man those are like are we talking about newer quality of life so things that they've already done and we want to make sure they carry over into diamond and pearl do we think that what the question is is that i want faster breeding i want i want the breeding to be faster i want like the destiny not stuff to stick around i want the hm stuff to stick around see my problem with breeding is we just need new breeding the masuda method that has existed since gen 4 has barely changed i'm somebody's gonna be like well you could do egg moves easier but wait it's so different in i mean okay i was thinking shiny hunting because like in in galler it's just like kill as many combi as you can and eventually they'll get shinier and shinier what do you want to be better about breeding but it was like what what's funny though they added in the whole like if you have a move you don't have to get the egg anymore it can just be taught to the pokemon you put in there like as the big reason you did egg moves they got rid of bottle caps fixed breeding for evs like mints fixed breeding for nature's like what improvements do you want like well so the all of those to be in diamond and purple as i said i want all the breeding improvements to be diamond and pearls my job is going to be uh to have the shiny charm because the shiny charm didn't exist in diamond and pearl that's true i want the mark charm to be a diamond pro but there's no marks we don't know if there's no marks yeah i know i'm just saying i want the charm but no marks what what is something here i'm going to rephrase the question what is something that sword and shield still does poorly oh wait no here's what diamond in pearl needs access your boxes from wherever you are not having to go into a pokemon center that's the quality of life that we have forgotten was an issue well that was first in let's go and then it wasn't sword and shield and that feature is very good it's very very good uh i mean i want the union rooms to work better than wycombe well if we've learned anything from game freak it's that every online feature is worse than the last game you all complained about festival plaza and you're and now we got why come uh what do you think that certain shield does that's that needs improvement still i i just i don't know if i i don't think breeding is broken i just think it's bad like it's it's just the same thing right like when when i i think some stuff is good for a couple games but we're like four generations plus everything in between and it's like the same put two pokemon in spin in a circle okay and sun and moon they put like a little fence and you can like crawl into that fence and you can like spin and then auras they just gave you like an auto turn thing but it just feels so maintenance heavy that that like the little thing like the fence thing really bothered me because i would breed a lot in sun and moon and people were like why don't you go into the fence and do it and it's like but if i'm in the fence i can't talk to the girl and she keeps crossing her arms and i need more eggs like i need to talk to her to get eggs and they so i they'd be like so i could just keep talking to her over and over right to get a bunch of eggs and then take those eggs into the fence and spin but i still have to spin in front of her otherwise she's not going to cross her arms so if i'm spinning in front of her to get her to cross her arms i might as well be hatching eggs when i'm standing in front of her right she only crosses her arms based on your steps you can't just stand there well she crosses her arms when an egg is generated yeah right i mean you're gonna be anywhere you'll be wandering all over you could be doing new trials and come back that i think is the problem is like what if there was like an egg system where you could be everywhere in the world and the lady just puts them on a shelf for you or something like i kind of like because she you don't get a new egg until you talk to her and try what to do with these oh that's what you want to fix you want to say put all eggs on the shelf until i come back or just something new like like i'm saying like there's no point in having that little fence because you can't even reach her without you getting off the toros was it tauros talk to her get the do the egg biz get back on the tauros in the fence and spin that was so much worse oh this is you're the king of too many clicks the whole point of the fence was the toro spin really fast to hatch a bunch of eggs yes yes and it would hatch all six at once yes to like if you're going to leave the fence area get on and off your tauros just do it in front of her no now the fence made it so you just had it yeah the fence made it confined to you the why button in sword and shield does something different than the y button yeah like this is not a real issue for normal human beings and you're confusing yourself for a normal human being so here this is the quality of life issue i want in diamond april i want the y button in diamond and pearl when i'm in my boxes to do the same thing as the y button in pokemon home so i don't have to hear about it from his ridiculousness moon it was you were better off using stoutland than tauros do you know why how why i can't listen to this i'm like oh my gosh let me let me blow some minds stoutland was so much better than taurus because tauros was slower walking stoutland was faster walking scotland didn't have a speed boost tauros you had to hold down a button for taurus to go fast and there was rev up time and rev down time and so if you are a true breeder you want one hand free no you do you and your one hand free garbage boring and tedious that you want to have like a beverage in one hand maybe a daddy like my life that way no no no no no no no no one thing at a time will that's my name i will do a youtube video and i will show you all how are you showing me spoilers are you showing me star wars spinning in the fence or are you doing your own thing nobody else in the world does waste the time to go in the fence take the time because because when you once you go on the fence you got to leave the fence you got to get off you got to get on then once you're in there spinning you got to get off you got to get back on you got to talk to the lady because you can't talk to her in the fence and then she's she's crossing her arms and those are all the eggs you were missing because you're not you're you're stuck so many shiny pokemon inside the fence now you are coming to the realization you did it wrong you should have been on southland i should have been killing copies on honeycomb did you get your six eggs and you go to uh you go to the you you go to the ocean and then you hatch them on the sharpito that's the actual way you hatch the eggs six eggs five eggs flame body sharpie spin in the water that's the real way to have it no no no and what was that ridiculous thing i heard you say one time you're like everybody what was it it was like everybody uses false swipe to catch pokemon unless it's a steal and then you use so i was like i have literally i'm telling the world right now never use false swipe to catch a single pokemon ever so don't you everybody nothing yeah some people just chuck pokeballs which i think you should just do yes i'm here to have a good time not a scientifically derived method of clinical capture hyaluronic acid thank you the egg stuff i want new egg stuff i don't know what it is i want something to see this is the thing i don't know what it is i would have never thought of sos i would have never thought of hordes i would have never thought of pokey radar i ain't no game developer but what i do know is i'm sick of doing the same thing i've been doing since gen 4. that's what i'm saying give me something fresh spoiler alert two people breeding has been since humans existed yeah but these are pokemon yeah and we still don't know how that works in the pokemon world fyi but nobody knows pokemon instead of hatching on like a tauros or stout land i think it's when you're hatching out him a champ ah yes yeah yeah he carries you around that's the true that is the real way that is real to do it being cuddled this this is from uh bubble god animation from our youtube i'm pulling it because of greg what during a playthrough of sword and shield i noticed that rosalia is the on the floor pattern of the wind in hotel i don't think it's windy and i think it's it's the rose is the rose of the ron lin's hotel in windham stadium and what's also noticeable is that the hotel in what's the fire city dag nabbit i'm i'm literally there in the game right now the kabu city yeah yeah i thought that's where the rosalio first hotel uh what pokemon do you think would make the best looking decor for a hotel lobby i mean i liked it so much i got it on my channel you'll never get a job now you'll never be able to get a professional job i know how everyone we got to kick you off this podcast no tattoos a lot excuse me with bad boy will hey don't point at me bad bad boy will i keep them uh andrew from youtube said my vote would be criagonal i don't know if that's no that's a good one i think that is actually interesting uh like decor wise like bolton would be great like are we talking about high end or like a motel 6 type of thing because the motel 6 it's this pupa basically [Laughter] ah not pikachu i did one stay at a hotel in brazil that had these tiny monkeys in the courtyard so chim chars oh yeah chimp charts ah you know what uh is done really well in unite is they have like water fountains and i think one of them is like dugong and they're really they're really elegant i could see like i could see a swanna themed hotel like the all the fountains are uh uh are swan themed yeah just just to clarify for our listeners around the world um steve said water fountains where most people would say fountains because where he comes from a water fountain is a bubbler yes uh i don't say bubbler but i do know the reason why it says it's called bubbler it doesn't matter doesn't matter but i don't say bubbler water fountain means one thing something you drink water from anything else it's just a fountain uh so who's your choice what a dugong but that's already in the game pick a different one what um hmm [Music] elegant elegant elegant elegant little again those little against always get in my way on the combi island hate them unless it's ready then it's zombies i'm gonna actually pull an email real quick uh because i said i was going to and i didn't remind myself uh this is from andreas they said hi guys english is not my first uh language please excuse my mistakes uh also this is like better well it's more your english is better than mine but that's what i'm gonna say it's a low bar as you like to say ah we can rename the show to a low bar uh i just want to give my two cents on the new forms uh in the past situation that greg was talking about the latest episode that was actually two weeks ago uh just a quick background i am as a historian working in a museum let me start with this greg asked why we have no written information on forms that appear in the old cino uh from all latin texts ever written we have about one percent of it uh all the others didn't survive the ages a fire can destroy a whole library a flood as well sinnoh is close to a volcano an eruption would have had massive effects on the ecosystem famines would also happen in that time and people didn't care about written records on the topic of famines in general only small adaptive species that need little food to survive little food would survive a famine evolutions like weird deer that is big and needs tons of food with struggle so i can definitely see why especially i can definitely see why some evolutions would go extinct evolution on top of that is just an adaptation of a specific location the pokemon it is in in the his region and the central region are very very different a pokemon might not just not be able to evolve anymore as soon as the region is inhabited by humans maybe the lack of untouched wildlife and deforestat deforestation leads to less predators therefore basklin tend to die less when traveling upstream and therefore it cannot evolve because it needs the souls of dead basculin lastly the roman emperor caesar when he conquered uh germania or maybe just germ is that germania when it's in latin yes uh wrote down a whole catalog of wildlife there some in which we cannot pinpoint down he also talked about a reindeer-esque creature with only one horn in the center of its head and about an animal that sounds a lot like an elephant my point is that it's un it's not unlikely that animals go extinct and written records get lost and even if we have a writer that might describe it in a way that modern humans cannot make the connection of what it was exactly meant maybe we have records of basketball library but we don't know about this one all the best andy uh please hard agree on the typing oh they they agree that the typings were there you go uh i mean yeah real world reasons sure this isn't the real world this is a game that has been like we remember we have statues of things that happened 3 000 years ago and we know exactly everything about them well that's because we have a dude from 3 000 years ago who's still walking around i mean that's why i just like crazy stuff actually there are a ton of dark reasons like i i get how the real world works right i think the volcano thing is a really good i'm just my thing is is i my biggest thing about that was how are they going to basically say hey they went extinct and hey there was a cataclysmic world event that erased all the records i would accept that i'm more concerned that they just aren't going to answer the question i see i see at all does it just be like collect your pokemon we're not going to say why they never carried over to the future bye-bye [Music] yeah i mean if any video game company can get away with not explaining anything it's definitely them yeah um but i re like i like i said the thing that stood out was like oh yeah like you go through mount coronet a million times in sinnoh but that was at one point a volcano right i mean it still is a volcano yeah yeah but so is yellowstone park yeah super volcano although let's remember we all thought mount st helens was dead guess what it wasn't um oh that was a good email though it's a good email i i mean i get it like i know as a human how bad things happen i'm just hoping they have a better explanation then i guess they went extinct i mean they wrote a whole character named daisy and then years later asked what that character was for and mossida went oh i don't know he was the king of kalos he built the giant crystal death block as i frequently say it made sense in the original japanese yeah oh look they needed another character just like they needed basculin to be another fish boy i like x and y i want to go on the record saying i do really like x and y i just cannot stand the actual story in that game i like all of my children all of my pokemon game children i just like some more than others yeah like all parents uh pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon referenced uh galler that i'm playing pokemon shield with my shiny bug team and there's this one pokemon that keeps showing up all over the place as a helper pokemon and it makes one noise when you listen to it but what's written on the screen is different than the noise it makes because it looks like it's trying to speak english to you when it tries um i mean it has a lot of characteristics that are similar to meow stick which has gender differences between the two pokemon there that's all you needed it's munchlax no it's indeedy indeedy it is indeed it's indeedy it doesn't have a shuffle icon so yeah i like indeedy all right i think it's cute i like it shiny too good competitively like what purpose it serves hips don't lie thick the boy indeedy looks angry and has the up hair the girl indeedy looks nice and has the down hair right yeah and then it's the opposite for meow stick the boy meow stick looks cute and friendly the girl meowstic looks angry yes uh and then the male one has inner focus and synchronize and then the female one has own tempo and synchronized and then they both have the same hidden ability which is the good one of psychic surge psychic surge which makes the the landscape psychic psychotrania on entry no more sucker punch or fake out with psychic terrain up good shiny too i i said that oh sorry indeed he shares the category with curlia and mesprit they're all known as the emotion pokemon and dd's the only pokemon to have different egg moves depending on i actually did not know that it's the only pokemon to have different egg moves depending on gender indeedy share similarities with meostic they're both known as psychic type pokemon with gender differences oh this is why was where we'll get his trivia from well no go right ahead um it's based on a layers what's a lot what's a lars is it spelled l-a-r-e-s guardian of deity and ancient roman religion never heard of that in my life this is just a person lares that's how they say it on wikipedia leires oh they're like minor deities that protected the house and stuff okay and it also may draw inspiration from brownies the household spirits from british folklore said to come out at night to perform domestic and farming tasks yep oh that's cute oh that looks like a goblin oh sub group goblin okay you gotta put some more brownies in your d d games greg uh excuse me i use brownies quite a bit you don't play in any of my dna games so how would you know uh in a monster of the week game that i wasn't even running as a player i brought in a brownie to to work in the bar that we all visited so it had better food i am so confused aren't brownies just like before they're girl scouts no well what's the next week's [ __ ] plan like most other regions in the poke earth the galler region has four fossil pokemon pokemon that have been restored from fossils unearthed within the region the gala region is differentiated though by the fact that none of its fossil pokemon evolves into or is an evolution from another pokemon this week's pokemon is a basic v and has two attacks the first attack does not do very much damage but if the defending pokemon is a v or gx that defending pokemon cannot attack during the opponent's next turn the second attack does a lot of damage enough to knock out a pokemon v if not a pokemon v-max but the attacking pokemon cannot attack during the next turn both of the cannot attack clauses can be worked around if you have a way to retreat the active pokemon and then return it to the active position during your turn in an earlier era this pokemon could potentially have worked with blastoise and keldeo there you go that's one for the tcg kids yeah this is this is you next week steve i think i know it i played some blast always killed you i gave like
