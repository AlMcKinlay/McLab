home against niantic's wishes I'm (0:38 - 0:46)
turning you over to the go police I'm (0:42 - 0:48)
pretty well it worked pretty well I have (0:46 - 0:50)
a home stop so I put on an incense I put (0:48 - 0:53)
on a lure I put on a star piece all of (0:50 - 0:55)
the Timber were weather boosted it (0:53 - 0:59)
worked pretty darn well Furious that you (0:55 - 1:02)
did not walk yeah required walking trust (0:59 - 1:04)
me I tried to walk on Friday and then it (1:02 - 1:08)
hurt more I'm having her that was a bad (1:04 - 1:11)
idea Greg also here Greg and I did (1:08 - 1:13)
Community together we did we went to the (1:11 - 1:17)
smell of America and walked around (1:13 - 1:20)
inside and listened to the Sweet song (1:17 - 1:22)
stylings of autumn (1:20 - 1:25)
Soul a band that I have never heard of (1:22 - 1:26)
until (1:25 - 1:29)
today uh the whole Mall heard of them (1:26 - 1:32)
the whole Mall Autumn soul today because (1:29 - 1:34)
you could not avoid it when you're on (1:32 - 1:38)
that side of the AC okay the Acoustics (1:34 - 1:40)
of M America (1:38 - 1:43)
are awful and I cannot imagine being a (1:40 - 1:45)
band trying to play in that rotunda (1:43 - 1:48)
because the echo is so bad you're also (1:45 - 1:51)
in front of two roller (1:48 - 1:55)
coasters a lot of competition lot (1:51 - 2:00)
of to the to the whole aspect of putting (1:55 - 2:02)
out a performance but that (2:00 - 2:04)
crowd the people who were there were (2:02 - 2:07)
into it or a Minnesota mean you got to (2:04 - 2:09)
kind of lower your expectations fora (2:07 - 2:12)
crowd we aren't standing and we sure as (2:09 - 2:14)
heck aren't dancing unless we have a (2:12 - 2:17)
Minnesota crowd in a mall in a mall in (2:14 - 2:20)
them all that aspect probably applies as (2:17 - 2:23)
well yeah you get everything uh we got a (2:20 - 2:25)
we got everything in the the show for (2:23 - 2:28)
you today we got a lot of different news (2:25 - 2:30)
a lot of little news um (2:28 - 2:33)
but look we can talk five hours but I (2:30 - 2:37)
have to do a hard cut off because it's (2:33 - 2:39)
late (2:37 - 2:42)
and I'm the one that has to edit this so (2:39 - 2:43)
as much as I would like a 5 hour show (2:42 - 2:44)
every (2:43 - 2:47)
week we got we got to we got to make (2:44 - 2:51)
make do here uh let's do our uh nine (2:47 - 2:53)
week Pokemon sleep checkin I don't know (2:51 - 2:58)
how many it's been I hit the (2:53 - 3:00)
butt you hit the buttons (2:58 - 3:03)
I didn't one night I finally missed one (3:00 - 3:05)
night and I didn't have the free trial (3:03 - 3:08)
to go back and put in the hours I was (3:05 - 3:11)
too tired I forgot now burn it delete no (3:08 - 3:15)
I keep I'm I'm continuing I am going (3:11 - 3:17)
slowly because I'm trying to evolve my (3:15 - 3:20)
shiny Riolu and it's not a great Pokemon (3:17 - 3:24)
for any of the snorlax's yeah I have a (3:20 - 3:26)
shiny (3:24 - 3:30)
Chikorita that I'm using why I have a (3:26 - 3:32)
shiny Arcanine I also have a shiny (3:30 - 3:34)
Squirtle am I using them no should I (3:32 - 3:36)
squirtle's good squir are one of the (3:34 - 3:38)
best Pokemon squ yeah the Squirtle line (3:36 - 3:41)
is great Squirtle loves milk you want (3:38 - 3:43)
milk Squirtle will get it for (3:41 - 3:47)
you lactose intolerant no deal I did not (3:43 - 3:49)
know that about the Squirtle line they (3:47 - 3:52)
should put that in bedia loves milk (3:49 - 3:54)
watch out mil take you're going to have (3:52 - 3:56)
a squirtle (3:54 - 4:00)
attack yeah I think um like Gastly (3:56 - 4:02)
Squirtle and Caterpie are like some of (4:00 - 4:07)
the best like early Pokemon you can get (4:02 - 4:08)
I could swap I should I could probably (4:07 - 4:12)
swap tood dial do I have a to I I have (4:08 - 4:14)
something something and hit their faces (4:12 - 4:18)
and they drop ber then I'm like should I (4:14 - 4:22)
cook okay does the fan do anything no (4:18 - 4:25)
what does the fan do it just speeds up (4:22 - 4:27)
the animation that's it there are (4:25 - 4:29)
definitely people who believe that if (4:27 - 4:31)
you tap perfectly you will get a (4:29 - 4:34)
critical hit what still still somewhat (4:31 - 4:37)
believe that I think what is what is the (4:34 - 4:39)
perfect tap what I want to do is I want (4:37 - 4:41)
to record every time I cook so that when (4:39 - 4:43)
I get the critical hit I can replay all (4:41 - 4:46)
of the recordings and compare them um (4:43 - 4:49)
but I I feel like if you have the fan (4:46 - 4:52)
going up at the very end when it hits (4:49 - 4:54)
the conclusion of the cooking that's (4:52 - 4:56)
when you get the critical hit on the (4:54 - 4:59)
cooking but could be wrong about that (4:56 - 5:01)
most most people think it's random it's (4:59 - 5:04)
probably random it's probably in our (5:01 - 5:06)
brains being brains that they are like (5:04 - 5:09)
to seek better anyways the fan is (5:06 - 5:12)
useless some I've completed some I like (5:09 - 5:14)
to tap to the Rhythm even though I know (5:12 - 5:15)
it doesn't do (5:14 - 5:17)
anything I don't know like the the fan (5:15 - 5:19)
is already going up yeah yeah yeah you (5:17 - 5:21)
tap with the fan it I don't know it (5:19 - 5:24)
feels (5:21 - 5:24)
good I feel like tapping too fastes me (5:24 - 5:29)
for anything fun and interesting in this (5:27 - 5:31)
dumb dumb game I like the game aot it's (5:29 - 5:33)
a fun (5:31 - 5:33)
game I like sending Pokemon to the (5:36 - 5:40)
professor and grinded them up oh I hav't (5:38 - 5:43)
any to anybody they're all sitting in a (5:40 - 5:45)
box staring at I'm still I'm still (5:43 - 5:47)
waiting to like sit down and go through (5:45 - 5:49)
every single Pokemon and start just (5:47 - 5:53)
chucking them I've done a little bit of (5:49 - 5:56)
that I don't get one every time I'm like (5:53 - 5:59)
but you but you need to be yeah yeah (5:56 - 6:01)
because it Powers the them up so like (5:59 - 6:03)
cuz the when when before you catch them (6:01 - 6:06)
they'll have like friendship levels yeah (6:03 - 6:07)
and that's how many you've caught so if (6:06 - 6:09)
you have like a friendship level three (6:07 - 6:11)
Caterpie it means you've caught I think (6:09 - 6:13)
two or three caterpies right like every (6:11 - 6:15)
time you catch one it goes up and when (6:13 - 6:18)
you get I think it Ma does it Max at 10 (6:15 - 6:19)
but like once you get to 10 you're like (6:18 - 6:22)
guaranteed at least one golden (6:19 - 6:25)
stat so then every Caterpie you catch at (6:22 - 6:27)
level 10 will be just significantly (6:25 - 6:30)
better than the like the level one level (6:27 - 6:32)
two level three cuz they'll be like (6:30 - 6:34)
guaranteed so you want like the golden (6:32 - 6:35)
stats cuz they're better than the blue (6:34 - 6:37)
stats and the blue stats are better than (6:35 - 6:39)
the white stats so can I can I ask you (6:37 - 6:42)
this question um what's my time frame on (6:39 - 6:43)
getting that (6:42 - 6:47)
done oh right forever so yeah I will (6:43 - 6:48)
just catch them when they're hungry and (6:47 - 6:51)
I do not (6:48 - 6:51)
care I mean that's going to take (6:51 - 6:57)
forever but like I I was prioritizing (6:54 - 7:00)
Squirtle and Caterpie cuz if they're (6:57 - 7:02)
going to be my like long con Pokemon (7:00 - 7:04)
then I want to get them to 10 the long (7:02 - 7:07)
con Pokemon is Pokemon sleep that is the (7:04 - 7:09)
long con and we are being ConEd there (7:07 - 7:10)
are like some Pokemon I don't care about (7:09 - 7:12)
at all though like I don't really care (7:10 - 7:14)
about like Mankey or I think like (7:12 - 7:15)
Chikorita and Mankey do the same thing (7:14 - 7:18)
it's just like Snorlax power increase (7:15 - 7:20)
and it's like I don't maybe that's like (7:18 - 7:21)
a I don't know maybe the Min maxing (7:20 - 7:23)
people are like yeah this is really good (7:21 - 7:24)
you never sent me the spreadsheet so I (7:23 - 7:27)
have no idea um I I don't even have this (7:24 - 7:29)
I have to look I'm sure the spreadsheets (7:27 - 7:30)
updated (7:29 - 7:35)
but like I I like the I like the item (7:30 - 7:37)
finder Pokemon or whatever and I like (7:35 - 7:39)
the Pokemon that doesn't randomly heal I (7:37 - 7:41)
like the Pokemon that heals the whole (7:39 - 7:44)
team mhm not heal it's like energy (7:41 - 7:47)
recovery energy yeah yeah yeah yeah so (7:44 - 7:49)
finders are pretty important too (7:47 - 7:52)
ingredient finders those are kind of my (7:49 - 7:54)
two main (7:52 - 7:57)
ones any of the ones that that get the (7:54 - 8:00)
dream shards like rolu and Lucario are (7:57 - 8:01)
not as helpful because you already have (8:00 - 8:03)
too many dream shards but I love my (8:01 - 8:06)
shiny Riolu so I'm keeping it on my team (8:03 - 8:07)
I should probably put the shiny I have a (8:06 - 8:09)
shiny growth I don't even know what it (8:07 - 8:12)
does uh I think Growlithe has like (8:09 - 8:14)
helping power so it like when it boosts (8:12 - 8:16)
it will like help somebody else but I (8:14 - 8:17)
think that's random (8:16 - 8:20)
too so your shiny growth could help your (8:17 - 8:24)
shiny Squirtle get more milk all right I (8:20 - 8:28)
will I will swap thing when when the (8:24 - 8:31)
when the whatever resets and I'm forced (8:28 - 8:35)
to restart through no fault of my own I (8:31 - 8:36)
will pick a new team and I'll put the (8:35 - 8:39)
shinies on there and I'll feed them (8:36 - 8:41)
candies or something yeah yeah you got (8:39 - 8:42)
to get them at least to level 10 before (8:41 - 8:43)
they (8:42 - 8:47)
start I have one 10 I think I have a (8:43 - 8:48)
couple I have yeah they don't go on the (8:47 - 8:50)
team unless they're bare minimum 10 (8:48 - 8:52)
because you got to unlock that first (8:50 - 8:55)
whatever skill I think it's called I (8:52 - 8:57)
have two Pikachu I could probably drop (8:55 - 8:59)
one Pikachu yeah you don't need double (8:57 - 9:01)
pika Pik also has the like Snorlax (8:59 - 9:04)
increase power or (9:01 - 9:06)
whatever (9:04 - 9:09)
um I have no good transition uh scarlet (9:06 - 9:12)
and violet those are video games uh they (9:09 - 9:15)
updated recently didn't they they did (9:12 - 9:17)
update that's what the news is about (9:15 - 9:20)
this is off Nintendo life uh (9:17 - 9:24)
2.0.2 is now live they did say like (9:20 - 9:28)
early October they were correct I like (9:24 - 9:30)
this came out on October 11th (9:28 - 9:32)
it's a couple days ago they fixed three (9:30 - 9:35)
things well this is what they say in the (9:32 - 9:37)
patch notes number one under certain (9:35 - 9:39)
conditions victories against NPC (9:37 - 9:40)
trainers scattered across the world may (9:39 - 9:42)
not be recorded we talked about this (9:40 - 9:44)
before about how the game could only (9:42 - 9:46)
remember you battling 300 trainers I (9:44 - 9:49)
think there are 307 or 309 trainers in (9:46 - 9:52)
the game um so if you were saving the (9:49 - 9:54)
ogre clan for last uh it just didn't (9:52 - 9:57)
remember and so you could never get the (9:54 - 10:01)
reward for what the ogre Clan does um (9:57 - 10:04)
this will this is fixed now uh this bug (10:01 - 10:05)
has been fixed so players who have (10:04 - 10:07)
experienced this issue can now challenge (10:05 - 10:10)
affected NPC trainers uh again to record (10:07 - 10:13)
their victories to then receive the (10:10 - 10:16)
rewards uh there was also it was not (10:13 - 10:17)
previously possible to transfer certain (10:16 - 10:20)
special Pokemon to Pokemon Scarlet or (10:17 - 10:22)
Violet via Pokemon home I still don't (10:20 - 10:25)
know why they're using the word (10:22 - 10:25)
special uh if Pokemon were brought in (10:25 - 10:30)
for Pokemon home for Pokemon even if a (10:28 - 10:32)
Pokemon of the same species was already (10:30 - 10:34)
obtained in scarlet and violet prior to (10:32 - 10:37)
version 1.3.2 this bug has been fixed or (10:34 - 10:39)
has been resolved uh one of the (10:37 - 10:42)
situations I know is Reggie Eli again (10:39 - 10:44)
we've talked about this a Reggie Eli (10:42 - 10:46)
from Pokemon go should be able to go to (10:44 - 10:49)
scarlet and violet but for for some (10:46 - 10:52)
reason it didn't work and now it works (10:49 - 10:57)
again apparently I I special Pokemon is (10:52 - 10:59)
still a really weird way to define (10:57 - 11:01)
there's nothing special about Reggie I (10:59 - 11:04)
mean he's a good boy he bounces a lot (11:01 - 11:08)
he's a good design but like I just say (11:04 - 11:11)
who they are (11:08 - 11:13)
like cuz like somebody commented on one (11:11 - 11:14)
of my YouTube videos of like I can't (11:13 - 11:17)
move anamaris over and I'm like well (11:14 - 11:19)
that doesn't make any sense cuz anamaris (11:17 - 11:21)
only comes from one game that's Legends (11:19 - 11:24)
AR you can only get it in one game it's (11:21 - 11:26)
Legends archus and I could I moved my (11:24 - 11:29)
enamoras over CU I use it in raids so (11:26 - 11:31)
I'm like does anamoros count as the (11:29 - 11:34)
special Pokemon so it like I don't know (11:31 - 11:35)
I don't know why you wouldn't be able to (11:34 - 11:38)
move anamoros over so if I don't know (11:35 - 11:40)
they put out a list of Pokemon it's (11:38 - 11:42)
fixed now I guess so it's really not (11:40 - 11:44)
that big of a deal but like why can't (11:42 - 11:47)
they just say like anamoros reggi Eli (11:44 - 11:51)
and lotad I don't know if lotad was fine (11:47 - 11:54)
it was just an example but why be so (11:51 - 11:56)
vague just tell us what's broken so we (11:54 - 11:59)
can be like ah okay cool (11:56 - 12:01)
because this team is not the Pokemon (11:59 - 12:03)
sleep team we already know (12:01 - 12:05)
that that team's so good at putting out (12:03 - 12:08)
updates it's so (12:05 - 12:10)
good they they love using their Twitter (12:08 - 12:12)
X or whatever they want to call it (12:10 - 12:15)
they're like here we go uh they also say (12:12 - 12:17)
other selected bug fixes have been (12:15 - 12:19)
implemented not (12:17 - 12:22)
sure what that means um there was that (12:19 - 12:25)
bug that I was experien oh yeah actually (12:22 - 12:27)
I do know I'm actually now that I'm (12:25 - 12:28)
questioning why I pulled this Nintendo (12:27 - 12:30)
life because (12:28 - 12:33)
uh I now remember the third bug that was (12:30 - 12:34)
fixed which (12:33 - 12:38)
was um I think Al in our slack had this (12:34 - 12:41)
issue or found this issue where if you (12:38 - 12:43)
took like Pokemon that were caught in (12:41 - 12:47)
kitami and then you went to battle the (12:43 - 12:50)
professor spoiler you battle the (12:47 - 12:51)
professor at the end of scarlet Violet I (12:50 - 12:54)
think that's fair game after 11 months (12:51 - 12:56)
um when you do that final battle with (12:54 - 12:58)
the professor and they send out either (12:56 - 13:00)
maride on or (12:58 - 13:02)
Kon and you just like went through your (13:00 - 13:06)
Pokémon party if it saw I'm sure Al is (13:02 - 13:07)
like listening being like I could tell (13:06 - 13:11)
you the exact specific issue if you hold (13:07 - 13:14)
your switch upside down under your bed (13:11 - 13:18)
in water red moon you shall see the bug (13:14 - 13:20)
before (13:18 - 13:23)
ye anyways the issue was something where (13:20 - 13:25)
like if you had a kak kakami Pokémon in (13:23 - 13:26)
your party and then you went to go (13:25 - 13:28)
battle the professor I'm really (13:26 - 13:29)
simplifying this cuz it was kind of hard (13:28 - 13:32)
to reproduce um the game would just (13:29 - 13:36)
crash oh that has been fixed um the bug (13:32 - 13:39)
that I had which was the let's go (13:36 - 13:41)
feature just randomly stop stopping to (13:39 - 13:44)
work was not mentioned at all um and I (13:41 - 13:46)
don't really know how to reproduce that (13:44 - 13:49)
bug without just doing hours and hours (13:46 - 13:52)
of let's go not the let's go Pikachu (13:49 - 13:54)
let's go Eevee the feature in scarlet (13:52 - 13:56)
and violet when you set out your Pokemon (13:54 - 13:57)
I just thought it just sent Pokemon to (13:56 - 13:59)
fly off cliffs to their Doom (13:57 - 14:01)
that happens sometimes too where your (13:59 - 14:03)
Pokemon just keeps (14:01 - 14:06)
running that I that could be a feature (14:03 - 14:08)
though because it's very could fun to (14:06 - 14:12)
watch um I don't know if that's fixed uh (14:08 - 14:14)
it was never mentioned but the the issue (14:12 - 14:16)
that some people had with the professor (14:14 - 14:18)
crashing that was mentioned not in this (14:16 - 14:21)
press release Nintendo life how dare you (14:18 - 14:23)
I trusted trusted you as I read this (14:21 - 14:25)
press (14:23 - 14:27)
release um so yeah they fixed a couple (14:25 - 14:29)
things that's cool (14:27 - 14:30)
I (14:29 - 14:34)
guess um just a reminder not that this (14:30 - 14:35)
has anything to do with scarlet and (14:34 - 14:37)
violet but just a reminder that (14:35 - 14:39)
brilliant Diamond shutting Pearl the (14:37 - 14:41)
critically acclaimed (14:39 - 14:44)
games the the shiny charm doesn't (14:41 - 14:46)
actually work except for specifically (14:44 - 14:50)
massuda method so for whatever for a (14:46 - 14:51)
faithful (14:50 - 14:55)
remake that was a decision that a group (14:51 - 14:59)
of people decided to make to one put the (14:55 - 15:02)
shiny charm in a game that didn't have (14:59 - 15:05)
the shiny charm but then promoted as a (15:02 - 15:07)
faithful remake but then chose to not (15:05 - 15:11)
have the shiny charm do anything except (15:07 - 15:13)
for if you're specifically doing the (15:11 - 15:14)
massuda (15:13 - 15:17)
method and then proceed to update the (15:14 - 15:20)
game and then not address that because (15:17 - 15:24)
that was a a decision that people made (15:20 - 15:27)
for (15:24 - 15:27)
whatever (15:28 - 15:33)
I have no clue I those games are bad I (15:29 - 15:35)
just want to say that they're not great (15:33 - 15:38)
games that was a decision that was made (15:35 - 15:41)
by a group of people the entire games (15:38 - 15:45)
were a decision yeah I mean there's a (15:41 - 15:46)
just don't put the shiny charm in then (15:45 - 15:48)
and just and then if somebody questions (15:46 - 15:51)
it you can stand by your statement of (15:48 - 15:53)
faith or reman the shiny charm was not (15:51 - 15:56)
introduced until black two White 2 not (15:53 - 15:58)
even the original black and white black (15:56 - 16:01)
two white to is when the shiny charm was (15:58 - 16:05)
introduced I there was a chance that for (16:01 - 16:06)
another group of people I was going to (16:05 - 16:08)
do a Nuzlocke of shiny Pearl because I (16:06 - 16:10)
haven't played it yet and I literally (16:08 - 16:12)
sat down and (16:10 - 16:17)
went there is no way I I am not capable (16:12 - 16:20)
of playing this game again I (16:17 - 16:25)
cannot my soul will die if I load that (16:20 - 16:27)
up and I've been thinking for like two (16:25 - 16:30)
weeks like what can I do to make this (16:27 - 16:35)
fun and I have not come up an idea that (16:30 - 16:36)
makes me want to the closest I've come (16:35 - 16:38)
is a luxury ball egg lock where (16:36 - 16:40)
everybody sends me eggs but they have to (16:38 - 16:42)
be in a luxury Ball but that's just (16:40 - 16:43)
selfish because I want to complete a (16:42 - 16:45)
luxury ball (16:43 - 16:48)
deck but I still don't want to play the (16:45 - 16:51)
game I just want the (16:48 - 16:55)
eggs I don't know it's (16:51 - 16:59)
bad it it was it was a definitely it was (16:55 - 17:01)
definitely a video game that's for sure (16:59 - 17:02)
yeah it definitely made (17:01 - 17:08)
money did it definitely ran and it (17:02 - 17:09)
was (17:08 - 17:13)
bug it was not bug free don't even say (17:09 - 17:15)

Museum Pikachu with a greyf felt hat (19:08 - 19:12)
promo card which came free with the pin (19:10 - 19:16)
set which was $50 uh that I ordered (19:12 - 19:18)
probably around (19:16 - 19:21)
11:15 a.m. the day that the disaster (19:18 - 19:24)
happened the day Zero when Pokemon (19:21 - 19:26)
Center failed to actually work for (19:24 - 19:29)
anyone except possibly scalpers (19:26 - 19:32)
um yeah that's when I was doing my (19:29 - 19:35)
72-hour Marathon I woke up people said (19:32 - 19:37)
that the Pokemon Center was updated I (19:35 - 19:39)
went there was a bunch of stuff sold out (19:37 - 19:41)
the pin set was still in stock I really (19:39 - 19:43)
didn't have any trouble adding it to my (19:41 - 19:45)
cart and purchasing (19:43 - 19:49)
it um and then I heard that people got (19:45 - 19:51)
their orders cancelled and I was like (19:49 - 19:54)
well mine didn't get cancelled and then (19:51 - 19:56)
it did like a week (19:54 - 19:59)
later um you never got that confirmation (19:56 - 20:04)
email I never did yes uh so I I ordered (19:59 - 20:08)
on September 29th and so that got (20:04 - 20:10)
cancelled all right second email from (20:08 - 20:12)
Pokemon Center again update on the van (20:10 - 20:14)
go Museum collaboration hi (20:12 - 20:17)
trainer fans shopping at Pokemon Center (20:14 - 20:20)
will soon receive another opportunity to (20:17 - 20:22)
obtain the Pikachu with gray Fel felt (20:20 - 20:24)
hat promo card trainers who purchase at (20:22 - 20:28)
least $30 of qualifying Pokemon TCG (20:24 - 20:30)
product will receive one Pikachu with (20:28 - 20:32)
gryf felt hat promo card with their (20:30 - 20:35)
orders while supplies last asteris uh (20:32 - 20:37)
stay tuned for additional updates via (20:35 - 20:39)
the email on our official social media (20:37 - 20:42)
channels CU that has always worked so (20:39 - 20:46)
well the first time uh the asterisk says (20:42 - 20:50)
get one van go Museum Pikachu with (20:46 - 20:53)
grafeld h cardo with every eligible (20:50 - 20:56)
order shipped to the US or Canada (20:53 - 20:58)
addressed from pokemoncenter.com wall (20:56 - 21:01)
supplies last no code require pre-orders (20:58 - 21:03)
and digital products are not eligible (21:01 - 21:06)
order must contain minimum of $30 from (21:03 - 21:09)
the TCG category (21:06 - 21:12)
so I still think they messed up (21:09 - 21:14)
communication wise because they were (21:12 - 21:18)
giving one felt promo card per item that (21:14 - 21:21)
you purchased so if you purchased like (21:18 - 21:23)
three (21:21 - 21:29)
7.99 van go deck uh TCG sleeves pack of (21:23 - 21:31)
sleeves or whatever for your cards you (21:29 - 21:34)
got three promo cards now they're (21:31 - 21:36)
saying which they've never done before (21:34 - 21:38)
by the way like in the past it was like (21:36 - 21:41)
one promo card per order doesn't matter (21:38 - 21:43)
if you order 20 or $100 you're getting (21:41 - 21:45)
one card that's why people would order (21:43 - 21:48)
they would make the separate orders um (21:45 - 21:51)
now they're saying that you get one per (21:48 - 21:52)
your order and you got to spend at least (21:51 - 21:56)
$30 specifically in the TCG and who (21:52 - 21:59)
knows what is in I don't know what's in (21:56 - 22:02)
stock right now for the TCG hopefully (21:59 - 22:06)
okay stuff but (22:02 - 22:06)
um (22:07 - 22:10)
yeah have want from the stuff that (22:11 - 22:16)
people want and the TCG is rarely in (22:14 - 22:20)
stock on the Pokemon (22:16 - 22:20)
Center yeah (22:21 - 22:24)
um that's fine I guess like (22:25 - 22:30)
who how many cards are they going to (22:31 - 22:37)
have when is this going to be happening (22:34 - 22:39)
they're they they say like watch out for (22:37 - 22:43)
social media watch out for the email but (22:39 - 22:44)
they have proven time and time again (22:43 - 22:47)
that like it's just not reliable like (22:44 - 22:51)
there are fan Twitter did they actually (22:47 - 22:52)
say Twitter no they just say social (22:51 - 22:56)
media um there are fan Twitter accounts (22:52 - 22:58)
or Facebook pages or subreddits that (22:56 - 23:02)
just get the news out faster that things (22:58 - 23:03)
are (23:02 - 23:06)
updating (23:03 - 23:10)
uh and I said this I said this on (23:06 - 23:14)
Twitter I don't (23:10 - 23:17)
understand why they don't reprint the (23:14 - 23:19)
entire collection not specifically the (23:17 - 23:22)
card like everything the playmats the (23:19 - 23:25)
the the plushes the the the paintings (23:22 - 23:26)
it's their (23:25 - 23:30)
stuff the (23:26 - 23:32)
I don't think the van go museum is like (23:30 - 23:36)
how dare you print more playmats with (23:32 - 23:40)
your iconic characters on it supposedly (23:36 - 23:43)
it's still in stock at the Museum too (23:40 - 23:45)
most of it everything except the (23:43 - 23:47)
plush (23:45 - 23:51)
like like they they messed up (23:47 - 23:54)
right they (23:51 - 23:56)
apologized why why don't they make more (23:54 - 24:02)
I just I I simply do not understand why (23:56 - 24:04)
they're very good at making plushes (24:02 - 24:06)
they're very good at making playmats (24:04 - 24:09)
they're very good at making TCG sleeves (24:06 - 24:11)
pins you name it they they put out the (24:09 - 24:14)
same products in rotation every two (24:11 - 24:17)
months three months they just change the (24:14 - 24:19)
Pokemon on it I don't know their (24:17 - 24:22)
Distributors right like I don't know (24:19 - 24:24)
specifically who's making the pins or (24:22 - 24:26)
the TCG sleeves but they're making a lot (24:24 - 24:28)
of them cuz they're make them they make (24:26 - 24:29)
them all all year (24:28 - 24:33)
long like if you you went out of your (24:29 - 24:35)
way to apologize to your customers (24:33 - 24:36)
that's fine I get (24:35 - 24:42)
like but like make more what what no one (24:36 - 24:44)
loses in this situation I guess maybe (24:42 - 24:48)
the scalpers lose scalpers lose but like (24:44 - 24:49)
your customers are (24:48 - 24:52)
happy so (24:49 - 24:55)
having worked with person that tried to (24:52 - 24:59)
do Printing and stuff with (24:55 - 25:03)
printers it's incredibly difficult once (24:59 - 25:07)
one run is done to reschedule to have (25:03 - 25:09)
the all the printers reset to run that (25:07 - 25:10)
batch again (25:09 - 25:15)
it's expensive and it's really hard to (25:10 - 25:17)
schedule because they have a pretty (25:15 - 25:20)
strict schedule of you're slotted in (25:17 - 25:22)
here we have you doing this batch and (25:20 - 25:24)
then we have to switch all the stuff (25:22 - 25:26)
around and switch everything out to run (25:24 - 25:28)
this next batch depending on on what it (25:26 - 25:32)
is so it could just be that they don't (25:28 - 25:37)
feel it is worth the expense of whatever (25:32 - 25:39)
extra fee the printer is going to charge (25:37 - 25:41)
them to interrupt their current printing (25:39 - 25:44)
batch to run a second run (25:41 - 25:48)
like my game sold out and then it was a (25:44 - 25:50)
number of months (25:48 - 25:54)
before dep depim games could order a (25:50 - 25:55)
second Printing and get it onto the (25:54 - 25:58)
block and then get it reprint printed (25:55 - 26:01)
and restructured put back out again it's (25:58 - 26:05)
not like it's not easy it's also not (26:01 - 26:06)
difficult I just imagine Pokemon (26:05 - 26:09)
companies like okay so will this still (26:06 - 26:12)
be super popular in five months when we (26:09 - 26:14)
can get the printing batch again and I (26:12 - 26:16)
think a lot of (26:14 - 26:20)
people on our end would say (26:16 - 26:22)
absolutely but it I don't know that they (26:20 - 26:24)
see that as a business case that's worth (26:22 - 26:29)
the risk of saying if we print another (26:24 - 26:32)
10,000 post 5 months later will be just (26:29 - 26:39)
be sitting on 5,000 Bango prints that go (26:32 - 26:39)
no like I don't know the answer I I (26:41 - 26:47)
don't know like I understand at least (26:44 - 26:49)
some of the reasons why they don't do it (26:47 - 26:51)
yeah yeah no I understand like (26:49 - 26:53)
production lines and like they have (26:51 - 26:55)
other things that need to come out (26:53 - 26:58)
whether that's H the Halloween or or (26:55 - 27:01)
Christmas or o like we got to make ogre (26:58 - 27:03)
Pond now like he has to come she has to (27:01 - 27:07)
come out in plush form (27:03 - 27:10)
but I feel like there's just like a (27:07 - 27:13)
responsibility that you as a company (27:10 - 27:15)
sometime especially a company that makes (27:13 - 27:17)
a lot of (27:15 - 27:20)
money and you have a very devoted fan (27:17 - 27:24)
base and I can understand (27:20 - 27:27)
although there there I would I would (27:24 - 27:28)
also assume that there's a lot of smart (27:27 - 27:30)
people that work at the Pokemon company (27:28 - 27:32)
that understands fulfillment and (27:30 - 27:34)
marketing and stuff but I I I would (27:32 - 27:37)
understand like they they underestimated (27:34 - 27:42)
the collaboration between Mr Mr one year (27:37 - 27:45)
and Pikachu like they didn't think that (27:42 - 27:47)
it was going to be like like I on this o (27:45 - 27:49)
my this own show I underestimated how (27:47 - 27:52)
popular Pokemon go would be I think (27:49 - 27:54)
everyone did no one thought that Pokémon (27:52 - 27:58)
go was going to be like a 7year plus (27:54 - 28:00)
ongoing game I think a lot of people (27:58 - 28:02)
were like ah this will this will fizzle (28:00 - 28:04)
out in a (28:02 - 28:04)
year I wouldn't say no (28:05 - 28:11)
one I think some people would argue that (28:09 - 28:14)
maybe it should have ended several years (28:11 - 28:19)
ago so like but like when you have uh I (28:14 - 28:22)
would consider it like a PR disaster of (28:19 - 28:25)
like oh yeah this was this was overly (28:22 - 28:28)
popular a lot of people wanted it you (28:25 - 28:32)
messed up who like so many people just (28:28 - 28:34)
wanted a plush or wanted a playmat or (28:32 - 28:38)
wanted a print and you like you could at (28:34 - 28:40)
least I'm not I don't even think you (28:38 - 28:43)
lose money like it might be like oh okay (28:40 - 28:44)
like we won't make as much of a profit (28:43 - 28:47)
on a second run but not only would you (28:44 - 28:49)
probably just break even or still make (28:47 - 28:52)
some of a profit you still you have like (28:49 - 28:55)
a retainment and a trust rebuilding with (28:52 - 28:58)
your audience of like agree I also think (28:55 - 28:59)
they just (28:58 - 29:02)
need we just need to figure out the (28:59 - 29:06)
scalper problem right (29:02 - 29:09)
like there needs to be (29:06 - 29:11)
something to (29:09 - 29:13)
stop the fact that a lot of this just (29:11 - 29:15)
gets eaten up to be thrown on eBay for (29:13 - 29:19)
outrageous prices and I (29:15 - 29:25)
don't I sometimes worry that a lot of (29:19 - 29:25)
companies don't want to put a lot out (29:25 - 29:30)
because they don't want to see the (29:28 - 29:33)
secondary Market Thrive as much as it (29:30 - 29:35)
does through scalping and I don't have a (29:33 - 29:37)
good way of like there's not a good way (29:35 - 29:39)
of stopping it like we've seen this (29:37 - 29:40)
happen in Magic where magic is trying to (29:39 - 29:43)
kill the secondary Market because they (29:40 - 29:45)
don't make money off it they they do a (29:43 - 29:47)
ton of reprints in (29:45 - 29:49)
new products but of course they've been (29:47 - 29:51)
overpricing their product so like nobody (29:49 - 29:52)
wants to buy the reprints we'll just (29:51 - 29:54)
wait till the third parties pull them (29:52 - 29:56)
out of pack and sell them singly again (29:54 - 29:59)
because right you reprinted it I'm not (29:56 - 30:00)
guaranteed it and I still have to pay (29:59 - 30:03)
$200 for a box to maybe get this or I (30:00 - 30:05)
will still go to your secondary Market (30:03 - 30:09)
where being sold as a single and pay $5 (30:05 - 30:12)
for it because you flooded the market (30:09 - 30:14)
like the same things happening here (30:12 - 30:17)
where they just seem to (30:14 - 30:17)
have a lack of a Clear Vision on how to (30:18 - 30:23)
deal with scalping in the secondary (30:21 - 30:26)
market and I I don't like I can't sit (30:23 - 30:29)
here and come up with an answer because (30:26 - 30:29)
but I do feel like a lot of companies (30:30 - 30:37)
deliberately short (30:33 - 30:37)
things in an effort to make it a high (30:38 - 30:43)
collectible and make sure that only (30:41 - 30:45)
certain people get it without (30:43 - 30:46)
understanding that they're just also (30:45 - 30:49)
fueling heavily SC the scalping Market (30:46 - 30:51)
because of it and like and making a (30:49 - 30:53)
negative experience almost all around (30:51 - 30:56)
right and then the other flip side is to (30:53 - 30:58)
make so many of it that has just flooded (30:56 - 31:03)
the market and they have no value (30:58 - 31:07)
which almost seems better than what's (31:03 - 31:10)
happening now I think like having a (31:07 - 31:12)
flooded Market I mean ultimately it's (31:10 - 31:13)
kind of what happened with Comics like (31:12 - 31:16)
they went into the Super variant cover (31:13 - 31:17)
limited scarcity thing and then (31:16 - 31:19)
everyone's like well I don't want to buy (31:17 - 31:21)
all this I don't want to buy 17 covers (31:19 - 31:23)
of the same Comet and the comic Market (31:21 - 31:26)
started to D oh I don't want to buy $30 (31:23 - 31:28)
worth of TC cards that I've already (31:26 - 31:31)
bought I want to buy a van go Pikachu (31:28 - 31:34)
plush like I want I want him with the (31:31 - 31:36)
little painting (31:34 - 31:40)
board like I wanted that pin (31:36 - 31:42)
set like this is such (31:40 - 31:44)
a this (31:42 - 31:48)
is such a mediocre solution to be like (31:44 - 31:51)
okay we're reprinting the card and just (31:48 - 31:54)
buy what's we already have in stock like (31:51 - 31:57)
they they did take in account the (31:54 - 32:01)
scalper thing during the pandemic right (31:57 - 32:05)
like how many times have you listener or (32:01 - 32:07)
you two on the show have been banned (32:05 - 32:10)
from pokemoncenter.com like I I've been (32:07 - 32:12)
banned like three times cuz they're like (32:10 - 32:14)
you're clicking too fast yeah like I I (32:12 - 32:17)
don't think I'm clicking fast at all I'm (32:14 - 32:18)
not clicking (32:17 - 32:21)
fast I literally hit the back button and (32:18 - 32:24)
you said nope yeah I went to the website (32:21 - 32:26)
once and it was already like that then (32:24 - 32:29)
you then you're for like 24 hours so (32:26 - 32:34)
like they did put something in to (32:29 - 32:36)
like (32:34 - 32:39)
manage Bots I (32:36 - 32:44)
guess but like I I I I don't know like (32:39 - 32:46)
look at my profile look at how much (32:44 - 32:49)
money I have spent in the last like four (32:46 - 32:52)
years you've got up definitely not a (32:49 - 32:54)
this is something (32:52 - 32:57)
that they should do like a pre-sale (32:54 - 33:00)
ticket code thing like to do for to help (32:57 - 33:03)
herb some scalping for ticket sales (33:00 - 33:07)
where select people get a code for (33:03 - 33:09)
pre-sales that goes out in email that (33:07 - 33:11)
goes out to a select group of people (33:09 - 33:13)
that they know are big that are Big (33:11 - 33:15)
Spenders that you know have a ton of (33:13 - 33:17)
verified purchases to allow those people (33:15 - 33:20)
to purchase first in a limited quantity (33:17 - 33:24)
and then once they sure like hey all of (33:20 - 33:26)
you who have a code the code works for (33:24 - 33:28)
Thursday and Friday and then full sales (33:26 - 33:31)
happen on Saturday that might (33:28 - 33:34)
help somewhat but again that takes time (33:31 - 33:36)
and money and effort from people and I (33:34 - 33:38)
do not think the Pokemon (33:36 - 33:42)
company cares that and it would be sad (33:38 - 33:44)
for the people who can only occasionally (33:42 - 33:48)
buy things they really really want (33:44 - 33:51)
yeah even like a lottery system would (33:48 - 33:53)
still be (33:51 - 33:53)
better than than just like again reading (33:54 - 34:01)
this email of like it'll come back we (33:58 - 34:03)
have no clue what day we have no clue (34:01 - 34:06)
what time we have no clue if they're (34:03 - 34:08)
going to actually properly communicate (34:06 - 34:11)
when it drops so it's like am I going to (34:08 - 34:13)
be in the shower when this happens on (34:11 - 34:15)

the contact (36:02 - 36:06)
form uh (36:03 - 36:10)
so they they still had cards obviously (36:06 - 36:13)
but now they're saying we we just aren't (36:10 - 36:16)
handing them out anymore uh and this is (36:13 - 36:18)
this is part of why I cancelled my my (36:16 - 36:20)
flight uh which would have been let me (36:18 - 36:21)
double check (36:20 - 36:26)
here uh the December 4th I would have (36:21 - 36:28)
went which is a (36:26 - 36:32)
Monday um but yeah they they're they're (36:28 - 36:34)
for my they didn't say it here but for (36:32 - 36:37)
my understanding of sleuthing and and (36:34 - 36:39)
talking to people who went to the event (36:37 - 36:42)
uh that there was still every day a (36:39 - 36:44)
bunch of people waiting outside of the (36:42 - 36:46)
exit of the museum and when somebody (36:44 - 36:49)
would walk out they would offer to buy (36:46 - 36:53)
the felt card off of that person yeah in (36:49 - 36:56)
their FAQ on their website it is kind of (36:53 - 36:57)
a (36:56 - 37:01)
awful small paragraph to read where they (36:57 - 37:03)
are answering why it's no longer (37:01 - 37:07)
available where and I can read it if (37:03 - 37:10)
that's cool it says the Veno Museum and (37:07 - 37:12)
the Pokemon company International take (37:10 - 37:15)
the Safety and Security of visitors and (37:12 - 37:17)
staff very seriously recently a small (37:15 - 37:19)
group of individuals has created an (37:17 - 37:22)
undesirable situation that has led us to (37:19 - 37:23)
take the difficult decision to remove (37:22 - 37:25)
the Pikachu with gray felt hat promo (37:23 - 37:28)
card from the museum (37:25 - 37:30)
in this way visitors will be able to (37:28 - 37:31)
experience this special collection of (37:30 - 37:33)
Pokemon paintings and the rest of the (37:31 - 37:37)
museum in a safe and enjoyable (37:33 - 37:37)
manner this is outrageous to me I like I (37:38 - 37:45)
I'm both it's absurd like angry and (37:41 - 37:47)
flabbergasted (37:45 - 37:52)
that like a a museum is is private (37:47 - 37:56)
property ask them to leave is it public (37:52 - 37:58)
I don't it it really depends on the (37:56 - 38:01)
museum I don't I don't know I don't know (37:58 - 38:04)
the qualification for this one but there (38:01 - 38:07)
a lot of museums are public property (38:04 - 38:10)
they're owned by the government so it (38:07 - 38:12)
gets really complicated (38:10 - 38:15)
but I I don't know about the vano I like (38:12 - 38:20)
it's also European laws different than (38:15 - 38:20)
ours (38:22 - 38:27)
this whole situation is just (38:24 - 38:32)
incredibly poorly managed and like at no (38:27 - 38:35)
point got better like I don't I think (38:32 - 38:37)
they have some merch like Hannah said (38:35 - 38:40)
not the plush supposedly in their FAQ (38:37 - 38:42)
they do have a list of the merch that is (38:40 - 38:44)
supposed to be available still and it's (38:42 - 38:46)
most things are available still in the (38:44 - 38:50)
museum except for the plush and the (38:46 - 38:50)
card and they had to like move the card (38:50 - 38:54)
to like a different part of the museum (38:52 - 38:56)
and then they got rid of the scavenger (38:54 - 38:58)
hunt that you needed to do because (38:56 - 39:00)
originally it was you go to the museum (38:58 - 39:01)
you do the scavenger hunt you hand in (39:00 - 39:04)
the scavenger hunt you get the card they (39:01 - 39:06)
did cut that and then they were handing (39:04 - 39:10)
the card out as you exited the (39:06 - 39:10)
museum (39:10 - 39:13)
like also if they just printed more (39:14 - 39:19)
cards it would be less desirable for (39:17 - 39:22)
people to stand out there to try to make (39:19 - 39:25)
a profit because it wouldn't technically (39:22 - 39:27)
be worth their time if the card wasn't (39:25 - 39:28)
the card's not even worth as much as it (39:27 - 39:30)
was originally worth like you can as of (39:28 - 39:32)
this recording you can get the card for (39:30 - 39:36)
about $100 um which is not a lot for (39:32 - 39:38)
like there are definitely other Pokemon (39:36 - 39:40)
cards that are worth way more like for (39:38 - 39:44)
sure definitely um but like the the (39:40 - 39:47)
whole the card was being sold for $300 (39:44 - 39:50)
to $400 that was like maybe at most like (39:47 - 39:53)
a 48 hour to 72h hour window before it (39:50 - 39:57)
dramatically dropped to about a 100 um (39:53 - 40:00)
for that card so you know you ideally (39:57 - 40:02)
you print more cards you get in the (40:00 - 40:04)
hands of people who actually want the (40:02 - 40:06)
cards then they don't have to go to eBay (40:04 - 40:08)
to buy it and then you have less buyers (40:06 - 40:10)
and the sellers move on to something (40:08 - 40:12)
that is profitable like the only thing (40:10 - 40:16)
that like stops or slows down scalpers (40:12 - 40:20)
is like the demand going down right like (40:16 - 40:23)
if if a card is worth $100 and something (40:20 - 40:26)
else comes out that's worth a $200 (40:23 - 40:27)
profit they're going to they're going to (40:26 - 40:29)
move over to that (40:27 - 40:32)
versus you know if if it continues to be (40:29 - 40:35)
$100 and they can stand and get three (40:32 - 40:37)
four or five cards standing there for a (40:35 - 40:39)
couple hours versus okay now the card's (40:37 - 40:44)
only worth $30 they're going to move on (40:39 - 40:47)
like their their time is is everyone's (40:44 - 40:50)
time is valuable (40:47 - 40:53)
but (40:50 - 40:53)
like the the exhibit itself is not even (40:54 - 41:00)
particularly big like if you if you saw (40:57 - 41:03)
the the the the picture of like the (41:00 - 41:06)
paintings that that's kind of it mhm (41:03 - 41:08)
like you can kind of see the whole (41:06 - 41:10)
exhibit in a single picture like that's (41:08 - 41:14)
that's kind of it so for me it's it was (41:10 - 41:14)
like okay I want I want to go to this (41:14 - 41:19)
exhibit I want to see it I want to see (41:17 - 41:22)
the whole museum I want to see the city (41:19 - 41:25)
but I also like want to walk away (41:22 - 41:30)
with something that made that experience (41:25 - 41:33)
unique like even if the fossil Museum in (41:30 - 41:36)
Japan didn't have the Pikachu plush and (41:33 - 41:39)
for like I I I bring up the fossil (41:36 - 41:42)
Museum a lot because the fossil Museum (41:39 - 41:45)
was supposed to only be like a four to (41:42 - 41:49)
five month thing and then Co happened (41:45 - 41:50)
and they extended it and then other (41:49 - 41:53)
museums wanted to do it so they moved (41:50 - 41:55)
the exhibit from Museum to Museum and in (41:53 - 41:59)
the almost 3 years maybe going on four (41:55 - 42:03)
years that this went from a couple month (41:59 - 42:06)
project to a several year project they (42:03 - 42:09)
continue to make little Pikachu AR (42:06 - 42:10)
paleontologist (42:09 - 42:14)
plushes and when I was in the gift shop (42:10 - 42:15)
and they were restocking the plushes (42:14 - 42:17)
they they were low on some stuff right (42:15 - 42:19)
like they were low on shirts like if you (42:17 - 42:21)
wanted a shirt they only had like extra (42:19 - 42:24)
large or whatever right if if you wanted (42:21 - 42:27)
uh like postcards they only had like (42:24 - 42:29)
four of the five different postcards but (42:27 - 42:31)
when they opened the back door to the to (42:29 - 42:35)
the to the room it was all Pikachu (42:31 - 42:38)
plushes like floor to ceiling they were (42:35 - 42:42)
not running out anytime soon so like (42:38 - 42:44)
it's so frustrating looking at the (42:42 - 42:46)
situation because we have seen a (42:44 - 42:48)
situation before where they pivoted they (42:46 - 42:50)
were like we're going to extend this (42:48 - 42:51)
we're going to keep making plushes we're (42:50 - 42:54)
going to keep these things restocked and (42:51 - 42:57)
they turned it into a good experience (42:54 - 43:00)
and for this again I don't know who's (42:57 - 43:03)
like maybe the the museums in Japan just (43:00 - 43:06)
cared way more maybe like the Pokemon (43:03 - 43:09)
company cared way more than the Pokemon (43:06 - 43:11)
company International which is (43:09 - 43:13)
technically in charge of this because (43:11 - 43:16)
it's Europe it's not Japan where there (43:13 - 43:18)
are also a lot of museums with dinosaur (43:16 - 43:21)
bones I think there's only one van go (43:18 - 43:24)
Museum (43:21 - 43:24)
yeah it's just like they they could have (43:24 - 43:29)
pivoted and they could have made it a (43:27 - 43:31)
better experience and they could have (43:29 - 43:34)
worked or set the van go Museum up for (43:31 - 43:38)
success and been like mhm hey we're (43:34 - 43:40)
going to help you out hey maybe you (43:38 - 43:43)
should hire security and more security (43:40 - 43:44)
or different security and we'll like (43:43 - 43:47)
cover it because we want you to be happy (43:44 - 43:49)
with collaboration we want our Pokemon (43:47 - 43:52)
fans to be happy with collaboration (43:49 - 43:54)
like the only good thing I could say (43:52 - 43:56)
here here is they're offering to let me (43:54 - 44:00)
get my $40 back40 or whatever back cuz I (43:56 - 44:03)
bought two tickets (44:00 - 44:06)
um and I I (44:03 - 44:09)
I I I could probably go and still have a (44:06 - 44:12)
good time but the main reason I canceled (44:09 - 44:16)
is because of how sour I feel after this (44:12 - 44:19)
entire thing from the museum itself to (44:16 - 44:21)
Pokemon center.com to then (44:19 - 44:23)
pokemoncenter.com sending another email (44:21 - 44:28)
being like we're going to try again but (44:23 - 44:30)
we'll pick a day and a time and maybe (44:28 - 44:33)
we'll let you know and maybe you can buy (44:30 - 44:35)
some stuff and maybe the card will be (44:33 - 44:38)
attached like like every single stuff (44:35 - 44:41)
has been handled so poorly and I was (44:38 - 44:43)
just hoping in the last like two weeks (44:41 - 44:45)
that they would fix it and they were (44:43 - 44:48)
like nah lost cause I guess maybe the (44:45 - 44:50)
next event we'll do (44:48 - 44:53)
better like just so many opportunities (44:50 - 44:55)
to like C (44:53 - 44:57)
you (44:55 - 44:59)
you just have so much money and (44:57 - 45:04)
power as this Goliath to like just fix (44:59 - 45:07)
it and it's been such a huge mess yeah (45:04 - 45:10)
just in every aspect of it and the (45:07 - 45:13)
communication I just I feel awful for (45:10 - 45:15)
the museum my guess is that they thought (45:13 - 45:18)
it was going to go as smoothly as the (45:15 - 45:21)
dinosaur paleontology museums have and (45:18 - 45:25)
this was not that experience at (45:21 - 45:30)
all it's it's insane (45:25 - 45:30)
I I I I don't (45:31 - 45:36)
know (45:34 - 45:39)
how this (45:36 - 45:43)
company after so many (45:39 - 45:47)
events is still so bad at planning (45:43 - 45:52)
events I don't I don't (45:47 - 45:55)
understand how you can look at your (45:52 - 46:01)
track room record lately and not think (45:55 - 46:02)
we need to (46:01 - 46:06)
do anything better we need to really (46:02 - 46:09)
look at what we are doing and how we are (46:06 - 46:14)
running things and what our fan base has (46:09 - 46:17)
become I feel like they just are (46:14 - 46:20)
refusing to (46:17 - 46:24)
acknowledge where the world is in in (46:20 - 46:26)
conjunction with their fan base and like (46:24 - 46:28)
if you didn't expect people to be (46:26 - 46:31)
outside of a rare event (46:28 - 46:34)
collecting and trying to get a super (46:31 - 46:37)
rare card where have you been since 2020 (46:34 - 46:39)
what have you been watching cuz the rest (46:37 - 46:41)
of us watched fist fights in Target cuz (46:39 - 46:45)
people were so bored like what where are (46:41 - 46:49)
you as a company like it just feels like (46:45 - 46:50)
they just want to (46:49 - 46:55)
pretend that their fan base is somehow (46:50 - 46:59)
better than it is and it's not no fan (46:55 - 47:00)
base (46:59 - 47:06)
is and you they're just refusing to like (47:00 - 47:08)
deal with it they're just throw it in (47:06 - 47:10)
the air it happens and we'll apologize (47:08 - 47:14)
later maybe in this (47:10 - 47:17)
like I don't (47:14 - 47:20)
understand where you want where you are (47:17 - 47:23)
going because I can't figure out after a (47:20 - 47:25)
series of (47:23 - 47:30)
just poorly and catastrophically planned (47:25 - 47:34)
events what what your end goal is what (47:30 - 47:35)
what do you what do you want these (47:34 - 47:39)
events to be because they're (47:35 - 47:42)
bad I I just I don't (47:39 - 47:45)
understand what is happening with this (47:42 - 47:48)
company in any way shape or form right (47:45 - 47:51)
now yeah it even it even goes back to (47:48 - 47:53)
their Pokemon centers at like a national (47:51 - 47:54)
tournament or regional tournament or (47:53 - 47:57)
World Tournament like we know no we we (47:54 - 48:01)
have so many years that we of of of just (47:57 - 48:04)
knowing that people want the (48:01 - 48:06)
backpacks and that's that's the thing (48:04 - 48:08)
that is sold out all the time is the (48:06 - 48:10)
back that's one of the first things I (48:08 - 48:11)
learned the first time I went to a (48:10 - 48:15)
worlds and you you you (48:11 - 48:17)
look like I (48:15 - 48:20)
remember the Nashville World (48:17 - 48:23)
Championships gosh what year was that (48:20 - 48:26)
where it was in Nashville and I was (48:23 - 48:32)
there the the day be like Friday right (48:26 - 48:34)
and I walked right into the Pokemon (48:32 - 48:35)
Center there wasn't a huge line or (48:34 - 48:39)
anything right and out of everything in (48:35 - 48:41)
that entire store the the first thing (48:39 - 48:44)
that was sold out was the backpack and (48:41 - 48:45)
it was like we're we're not we haven't (48:44 - 48:47)
even been open for an hour and this one (48:45 - 48:50)
item for the rest of the weekend Friday (48:47 - 48:52)
Saturday Sunday is sold out it's sold (48:50 - 48:56)
out in an hour and when I went to I can (48:52 - 48:57)
name a bunch of events but going back to (48:56 - 48:59)
the latest event which is the the (48:57 - 49:02)
Columbus Ohio National (48:59 - 49:04)
Tournament there I talked to so many (49:02 - 49:06)
people that were like yep I had a Friday (49:04 - 49:09)
morning 8: a.m. thing and people were (49:06 - 49:10)
already in there before 8:00 a.m. I (49:09 - 49:12)
thought they said it open at 8:00 a.m. (49:10 - 49:14)
but they let people in early and the (49:12 - 49:15)
first person that walked out came out (49:14 - 49:18)
with eight backpacks (49:15 - 49:22)
eight why did they let him buy eight (49:18 - 49:25)
backpacks no one need maybe you have (49:22 - 49:27)
seven children I don't know and they're (49:25 - 49:31)
all ready to go to school doubtful but (49:27 - 49:34)
like even when when if you watch my (49:31 - 49:37)
world video when I went to the Yokohama (49:34 - 49:38)
World (49:37 - 49:41)
Championship I the thing I was excited (49:38 - 49:44)
about was that there was like oh it says (49:41 - 49:47)
limit to here and then there were some (49:44 - 49:49)
items that didn't have a limit and when (49:47 - 49:51)
I walked out one of the people that (49:49 - 49:53)
worked at the Pokemon company was like (49:51 - 49:53)
how did you like it do you have any (49:53 - 49:56)
feedback for us and I was like yes (49:53 - 49:58)
everything needs a limit everything (49:56 - 49:59)
because you know what happened at (49:58 - 50:03)
Yokohama no surprise the backpack was (49:59 - 50:07)
sold out on the first day again (50:03 - 50:09)
like make more (50:07 - 50:12)
backpacks no one needs eight backpacks (50:09 - 50:16)
like it just it (50:12 - 50:18)
like make more (50:16 - 50:22)
stuff yeah it just again I don't know (50:18 - 50:28)
like it it feels deliberate to not learn (50:22 - 50:30)
from every experience you've had it (50:28 - 50:34)
feels like a deliberate choice at this (50:30 - 50:36)
point because you cannot look at your (50:34 - 50:40)
history of how things go and be like (50:36 - 50:43)
well it good old ways are the way to go (50:40 - 50:47)
pride and true like you're just actively (50:43 - 50:50)
refusing to look they're walking A Real (50:47 - 50:52)
Fine Line trying to keep things on the (50:50 - 50:55)
rare and valued side so that people want (50:52 - 50:58)
them because they're rare and valuable (50:55 - 51:00)
and end up making experiences that are (50:58 - 51:02)
just (51:00 - 51:02)
unpleasant yeah it just like I it's so (51:04 - 51:11)
hard for me to be (51:08 - 51:13)
like yeah you should go (51:11 - 51:16)
to nor Orleans for the the the national (51:13 - 51:19)
championship and (51:16 - 51:22)
like hopefully you get in line early (51:19 - 51:24)
enough at the Pokemon Center and (51:22 - 51:26)
hopefully you get everything you want (51:24 - 51:30)
because like if you're booking Saturday (51:26 - 51:33)
Sunday stuff is just going to be sold (51:30 - 51:36)
out yep and like the stuff that isn't (51:33 - 51:38)
normally sold out is just the stuff you (51:36 - 51:41)
can just get on Pokemon center.com yep (51:38 - 51:44)
like when I walked into the Ohio I (51:41 - 51:45)
didn't have any like special privileges (51:44 - 51:48)
or anything for Ohio I I got like a free (51:45 - 51:50)
like spectator pass or something so I (51:48 - 51:52)
guess disclosure they paid my like $11 (51:50 - 51:55)
spectator pass but like I walked like I (51:52 - 51:57)
didn't want to wait in line like I like (51:55 - 52:02)
it was it was if you didn't register and (51:57 - 52:03)
you didn't win the (52:02 - 52:06)
lottery uh you don't get to go online (52:03 - 52:08)
you could possibly wait in the standby (52:06 - 52:12)
line for up to 4 to 5 hours and that was (52:08 - 52:14)
random too that was like depending on (52:12 - 52:15)
what employee was working they'd be like (52:14 - 52:18)
n we're not taking anyone in standby to (52:15 - 52:19)
uh yeah sure jump in standby it might be (52:18 - 52:22)
a couple hours and then so when the line (52:19 - 52:25)
was finally dead on Sunday why was the (52:22 - 52:27)
line dead because they literally had no (52:25 - 52:29)
product left and so when the line was (52:27 - 52:30)
dead I was like I just want to see what (52:29 - 52:32)
like what it looks like like I don't (52:30 - 52:33)
really want to buy anything I walked in (52:32 - 52:35)
and it was everything that was in stock (52:33 - 52:37)
was just stuff you get like just stuff (52:35 - 52:40)
you get off Pokemon Center like you want (52:37 - 52:43)
socks you want to travel all the way to (52:40 - 52:45)
Columbus Ohio to get $11 Pikachu socks (52:43 - 52:47)
that you could also just order from the (52:45 - 52:49)
comfort of your home did you want the (52:47 - 52:51)
overpriced Team Rocket merchandise that (52:49 - 52:53)
was like still fully in stock cuz it was (52:51 - 52:56)
a $10000 for a hoodie (52:53 - 52:59)
like that was what was in stock but (52:56 - 53:00)
that's not why people are going to those (52:59 - 53:03)
Live Events like maybe some like maybe (53:00 - 53:04)
like somebody like I understand the (53:03 - 53:07)
impulse by of like oh I'm at a live (53:04 - 53:09)
event let me get this Durant plush cuz (53:07 - 53:11)
like I like Durant um but like people (53:09 - 53:14)
are going I think a lot like it's the (53:11 - 53:17)
same thing as like a band like no one is (53:14 - 53:20)
buying like a like a Fallout Boy shirt (53:17 - 53:22)
because it's an amazing design they're (53:20 - 53:23)
bought they're buying the Fallout Boy (53:22 - 53:25)
shirt because they went to the concert (53:23 - 53:28)
and they want like a token of like I was (53:25 - 53:31)
there like that's why I would have went (53:28 - 53:32)
to the van go Museum so somebody would (53:31 - 53:33)
be like where'd you get that Pikachu (53:32 - 53:35)
plush like oh cool I had an amazing trip (53:33 - 53:37)
to Amsterdam and like I got this plush (53:35 - 53:39)
and I saw this Museum and like I can't (53:37 - 53:41)
wait to go (53:39 - 53:43)
back why are they so bad at these lava (53:41 - 53:47)
why are they so bad at these (53:43 - 53:50)
events (53:47 - 53:50)
ah the (53:51 - 53:56)
other (53:54 - 53:58)
it's like I also don't want to take away (53:56 - 54:01)
from how awful people are at these (53:58 - 54:04)
events like there is a (54:01 - 54:07)
human aspect of people being awful that (54:04 - 54:10)
make this awful like scalpers are awful (54:07 - 54:13)
and they do awful things that are trying (54:10 - 54:16)
to rip people off to make money people (54:13 - 54:19)
acting up outside the van go event like (54:16 - 54:21)
it's not the Museum's fault that people (54:19 - 54:24)
are awful like there's this level of (54:21 - 54:26)
toxicity among human beings when these (54:24 - 54:29)
things happen that are caused by false (54:26 - 54:33)
scarcity and again it's only scarce (54:29 - 54:35)
because they have chosen to make (54:33 - 54:38)
it they there is no way they don't have (54:35 - 54:40)
sales number that is not how business (54:38 - 54:42)
work they know what they're doing so (54:40 - 54:47)
they are bringing this upon themselves (54:42 - 54:50)
deliberately and also actively not doing (54:47 - 54:52)
anything about it I don't want to take (54:50 - 54:54)
away how awful scalpers are and how (54:52 - 54:56)
terrible the people are outside the (54:54 - 54:59)
museum but also let's not forget that (54:56 - 55:01)
the false scarcity and the Rarity and (54:59 - 55:04)
the specialness of that is 100% in (55:01 - 55:08)
control of a company that doesn't give a (55:04 - 55:08)
crap they also make more money if they (55:12 - 55:17)
make more product I mean there's like (55:14 - 55:19)
they know also at the end of like a a (55:17 - 55:20)
national tournament or regional (55:19 - 55:22)
tournament or a World Tournament they (55:20 - 55:23)
know how much product they have left (55:22 - 55:26)
over oh yeah it's not hard they have to (55:23 - 55:28)
they know what they're making and (55:26 - 55:29)
they're (55:28 - 55:32)
just ch like the only thing I could (55:29 - 55:35)
possibly think of is (55:32 - 55:35)
like how do we ship all this stuff (55:35 - 55:42)
there like like we could we we we have a (55:39 - 55:44)
limit because this is the the the (55:42 - 55:47)
freight that we're we're doing but I I (55:44 - 55:50)
don't believe for a second that like (55:47 - 55:53)
they don't make that money back in sales (55:50 - 55:57)
yeah I mean fre shipping is up (55:53 - 55:59)
but (55:57 - 56:03)
also the the more you ship you do get (55:59 - 56:05)
discounts when you ship more things like (56:03 - 56:07)
there is a scale there is a balance (56:05 - 56:10)
there it's not like I'm shipping 10 tens (56:07 - 56:12)
more and it's going to cost three times (56:10 - 56:14)
as much it will cost more because you're (56:12 - 56:15)
shipping more but they also to give you (56:14 - 56:19)
bigger discounts so like they also know (56:15 - 56:21)
like I still feel like Pokemon just (56:19 - 56:27)
refuses to grasp how big their brand (56:21 - 56:31)
actually like I just want to take them (56:27 - 56:35)
to Disney boot camp and make them sit (56:31 - 56:41)
with Disney and say these people true (56:35 - 56:44)
they're kind of psychotic but they know (56:41 - 56:47)
how to run stuff please learn from (56:44 - 56:51)
them yeah they're kind of evil but they (56:47 - 56:57)
treat their customers extremely well (56:51 - 57:00)
again the my my biggest complaint is (56:57 - 57:02)
they had so many opportunities to fix (57:00 - 57:05)
this fan go thing and they just didn't (57:02 - 57:08)
it just just seemed like my impression (57:05 - 57:10)
was they threw their hands up in the air (57:08 - 57:12)
and they were like (57:10 - 57:15)
well it's over on to the next project (57:12 - 57:17)
which is probably true which is probably (57:15 - 57:19)
like whoever was in charge of this (57:17 - 57:23)
probably is working on whatever is next (57:19 - 57:25)
that's probably very true they like we (57:23 - 57:28)
don't have time for this anymore the the (57:25 - 57:29)
Cog of the Pokemon machine needs to keep (57:28 - 57:33)
spinning and got we got to move (57:29 - 57:36)
on and hire more (57:33 - 57:38)
people they're trying to get the cards (57:36 - 57:41)
out there and that's that's about (57:38 - 57:46)
it uh okay we got to take a break uh so (57:41 - 57:48)
when we get back we got some part Party (57:46 - 57:49)
Party play is that what they're calling (57:48 - 57:54)
it um and uh some some some more stuff (57:49 - 57:55)
so we will be uh (57:54 - 57:56)
right (57:55 - 58:01)
back and we are back from our break uh (57:56 - 58:03)
we got a little bit of Pokemon go news (58:01 - 58:06)
here first bit is celebrate the (58:03 - 58:08)
beginning of Halloween adventure with (58:06 - 58:11)
gevard gri gri I don't know how to say (58:08 - 58:14)
that uh during the Pokémon go Halloween (58:11 - 58:16)
2023 part (58:14 - 58:21)
one um an A positive note I think I (58:16 - 58:23)
think most people really do like the (58:21 - 58:25)
Halloween event stuff that (58:23 - 58:27)
doeses (58:25 - 58:30)
um I think uh for the most part um it's (58:27 - 58:33)
pretty well received uh griever the (58:30 - 58:35)
Ghost Dog Pokemon and houndstone will (58:33 - 58:37)
make their Pokemon go (58:35 - 58:40)
debut uh I believe they will be (58:37 - 58:43)
shiny uh as well even though the website (58:40 - 58:44)
doesn't have the little Sparkle next to (58:43 - 58:47)
it I I thought they could be I could be (58:44 - 58:50)
wrong on that maybe that was just like (58:47 - 58:52)
the assets being uploaded and not being (58:50 - 58:54)
turned (58:52 - 58:57)
on yeah yeah I recall hearing that but (58:54 - 59:00)
they don't have the sparkle yeah but hey (58:57 - 59:03)
niantic's website Pokemon goli.com has (59:00 - 59:05)
definitely been riddled with errors (59:03 - 59:09)
before so it could be shiny there is a (59:05 - 59:11)
shiny that people are excited about (59:09 - 59:15)
though uh yeah yeah yeah um also the (59:11 - 59:16)
following Pokemon will be available in (59:15 - 59:18)
the wild ekins Zubat alone Meowth (59:16 - 59:22)
gastley Haunter spin M dous poena (59:18 - 59:25)
Shuppet drifloon Litwick Phantump uh and (59:22 - 59:27)
if you're lucky trainers you may also (59:25 - 59:30)
find Sandy gas in the wild um and for (59:27 - 59:32)
the first time in Pokémon go you'll be (59:30 - 59:35)
able to counter shiny Phantom if you're (59:32 - 59:39)
lucky I'll wait for the Community Day in (59:35 - 59:42)
2015 it's a real good shiny though it's (59:39 - 59:44)
a really good one it is but I'm not (59:42 - 59:46)
gonna hunt (59:44 - 59:50)
it um are the are we we're all in (59:46 - 59:52)
agreement that they're they're just (59:50 - 59:54)
milking the debut of mimik Q right like (59:52 - 59:55)
what (59:54 - 59:59)
when when is this Pokemon coming at like (59:55 - 60:02)
coming to un night in in a week I know (59:59 - 60:04)
that's why I thought that this year yeah (60:02 - 60:06)
I thought that this was going to be the (60:04 - 60:07)
year I thought they were going to line (60:06 - 60:10)
it up with the unite stuff cuz unite and (60:07 - 60:13)
Pokemon go and GameStop distribution (60:10 - 60:16)
yeah yeah they've all kind of been in in (60:13 - 60:19)
in symmetry a bit do they do we think (60:16 - 60:21)
it's because of his (60:19 - 60:27)
disguised ability and go battle League (60:21 - 60:27)
ah I mean I don't know how you make the (60:27 - 60:32)
disguise thing work when you're like (60:30 - 60:34)
constantly attacking like one attack it (60:32 - 60:36)
breaks and then you just keep attacking (60:34 - 60:38)
like it's not that great (60:36 - 60:41)
in go you think they're holding enough (60:38 - 60:42)
until they can figure out a better way (60:41 - 60:45)
to make the disguise thing work or like (60:42 - 60:46)
I'm trying to come up with reasons why (60:45 - 60:48)
they just haven't done it and why they (60:46 - 60:50)
wouldn't do it when you when it's when (60:48 - 60:52)
mimikyu is coming to unite literally on (60:50 - 60:55)
the 18th there's also been a mimikyu hat (60:52 - 60:56)
in Pokémon go (60:55 - 61:00)
forever yeah I mean like we all know (60:56 - 61:03)
that it's an incredibly popular Pokemon (61:00 - 61:07)
mhm like super popular like Pikachu had (61:03 - 61:09)
a mimikyu costume at one point did it (61:07 - 61:15)
not yeah that like a year or two ago (61:09 - 61:15)
like I mean like this Halloween event (61:15 - 61:20)
seems good like gevard great cool like (61:17 - 61:22)
lined up with scarlet and violet so (61:20 - 61:23)
people are like oh that's a cool Pokemon (61:22 - 61:25)
maybe I'll pick up these games (61:23 - 61:27)
like Phantom being shiny that's cool (61:25 - 61:30)
they're bringing the map back the whole (61:27 - 61:31)
game's going to look different the whole (61:30 - 61:33)
game's going to look spooky yeah that's (61:31 - 61:36)
also very cool for $5 you'll get (61:33 - 61:39)
exclusive timed research which if you (61:36 - 61:41)

with Phantom uh alolan Meowth you will (61:44 - 61:49)
get the Halloween pose which (61:46 - 61:52)
is I I'm not sure what they're trying to (61:49 - 61:55)
I I don't understand the pose is it like (61:52 - 61:58)
they're zombies it's kind of zombie (61:55 - 62:00)
esque it's like it's like the ghost (61:58 - 62:03)
coming yeah it's more ghost it's like (62:00 - 62:06)
the wo They Don't Really complete it (62:03 - 62:08)
they just sort of like stop halfway then (62:06 - 62:11)
reset so it's really super awkward to (62:08 - 62:14)
watch last year's was the zombies yeah (62:11 - 62:17)
yeah yeah yeah yeah uh there'll be time (62:14 - 62:19)
research that'll be free for everyone (62:17 - 62:22)
that'll get you more Stardust and gevard (62:19 - 62:25)
uh there's more time research where uh (62:22 - 62:28)
you get your one chance a year to catch (62:25 - 62:30)
Spirit tomb and if you're lucky it could (62:28 - 62:31)
be (62:30 - 62:36)
shiny like that's sure maybe in like 13 (62:31 - 62:38)
more years you'll be able to actually be (62:36 - 62:41)
lucky enough to roll shiny Spirit tomb (62:38 - 62:45)
Spirit Community Day 2060 there we go uh (62:41 - 62:47)
you'll get additional candy for nice (62:45 - 62:50)
great and excellent throws additional XL (62:47 - 62:55)
candy um two times hatch candy uh field (62:50 - 62:57)
research will give you m dous or Phantom (62:55 - 62:59)
one star raids will be M dous Shuppet (62:57 - 63:01)
drifloon three star raids will be Gengar (62:59 - 63:03)
Gastly gevard why is Gard done three (63:01 - 63:08)
star raids why why is that a choice of (63:03 - 63:10)
five star raids will be guzzlord until (63:08 - 63:13)
the 20th then it will switch to dark cry (63:10 - 63:15)
Mega raids will be Gengar until the 20th (63:13 - 63:18)
and then it will switch to Benet bayet (63:15 - 63:21)
bayet Benet 7K eggs will be the very (63:18 - 63:24)
spooky munchel ax Riolu and garan yam (63:21 - 63:25)
mask (63:24 - 63:28)
there will be uh new Avatar stuff a yam (63:25 - 63:30)
mask mask a cofagrigus costume a (63:28 - 63:35)
coffagrigus head a Phantump head a (63:30 - 63:36)
gevard (63:35 - 63:38)
wig uh there'll be new (63:36 - 63:40)
stickers uh they're doing something with (63:38 - 63:43)
Amazon Prime where you can (63:40 - 63:46)
get uh the wig for free I guess if you (63:43 - 63:48)
have Amazon Prime I think that's what (63:46 - 63:50)
they're saying pretty much it's another (63:48 - 63:53)
timed research that gets you the wig (63:50 - 63:57)
early I also thought not that maybe okay (63:53 - 63:59)
so sometimes like there's like assets (63:57 - 64:02)
that are data mined or whatever I maybe (63:59 - 64:04)
Halloween part two will be Gengar in an (64:02 - 64:06)
outfit there's like a new Pikachu coming (64:04 - 64:08)
apparently there is going to be a (64:06 - 64:10)
Halloween part two but that has not been (64:08 - 64:11)
announced yet yeah so I'm assuming (64:10 - 64:13)
Halloween part two would have the (64:11 - 64:16)
Pikachu in a Halloween outfit and Gengar (64:13 - 64:19)
in a Halloween outfit Gengar has the (64:16 - 64:20)
worst shiny in the entire world I don't (64:19 - 64:22)
know why they continue putting outfits (64:20 - 64:23)
on Gengar well I know why they put (64:22 - 64:26)
outfits on Gengar popular Pokemon it's a (64:23 - 64:29)
very popular Pokemon um that being said (64:26 - 64:31)
just because like stuff is data mind I (64:29 - 64:32)
just want to be very clear that that (64:31 - 64:34)
doesn't mean that they're guaranteed to (64:32 - 64:36)
come what was like Stantler with the (64:34 - 64:39)
reindeer Bells was like it we had to (64:36 - 64:41)
wait like a full like it was like data (64:39 - 64:43)
mind and then it actually never came out (64:41 - 64:44)
that Christmas it came out like the (64:43 - 64:47)
following Christmas so (64:44 - 64:50)
just like that stuff happens we're not (64:47 - 64:52)
the ones doing it we're just it just (64:50 - 64:55)
pops up on Twitter threads or whatever (64:52 - 64:57)
like I see it I'm like oh that's cool if (64:55 - 65:00)
it comes out might not come out come (64:57 - 65:04)
out um speaking of something that might (65:00 - 65:08)
not come out it should come out is the (65:04 - 65:10)
what party play is that what it's called (65:08 - 65:12)
yeah there's not a lot of information on (65:10 - 65:18)
it right now um uh Niantic did show it (65:12 - 65:21)
off to creators uh the other day and (65:18 - 65:24)
they said that it would be okay to talk (65:21 - 65:28)
about um so I think by the time this (65:24 - 65:32)
podcast comes up it should be out or (65:28 - 65:35)
more details should be there um although (65:32 - 65:37)
speaking of data mining if you read the (65:35 - 65:38)
data mine you probably actually know (65:37 - 65:40)
what it does yeah there's there's some (65:38 - 65:44)
information out there uh I mean here's (65:40 - 65:45)
the here's here's the gist of it here's (65:44 - 65:47)
what they told me hopefully I'm (65:45 - 65:50)
not making Niantic upset by saying this (65:47 - 65:52)
early but again I'm I I'm sure there are (65:50 - 65:54)
YouTube people that have already talked (65:52 - 65:57)
about it and whatnot but the gist of it (65:54 - 65:58)
is that you'll be able to play with up (65:57 - 66:02)
to four friends um you have to be within (65:58 - 66:05)
the location to start the party play so (66:02 - 66:08)
if you know me Greg will are at the Mall (66:05 - 66:10)
of America one of us would start it you (66:08 - 66:14)
have to be within pretty close to (66:10 - 66:16)
join and then it will give you like a (66:14 - 66:19)
task as a group that task might be like (66:16 - 66:22)
catch 20 Pokémon together and then (66:19 - 66:25)
between the three of us we catch the 20 (66:22 - 66:28)
Pokémon we get our reward um and then (66:25 - 66:30)
it'll give us another task I was told (66:28 - 66:33)
that it would like last like an hour uh (66:30 - 66:34)
and then it will automatically end so (66:33 - 66:36)
you're in the party for an hour also (66:34 - 66:39)
once you're in the party if Greg wants (66:36 - 66:42)
to leave and me and will stay behind (66:39 - 66:45)
technically the party still exists for (66:42 - 66:47)
that hour so like Greg doesn't have to (66:45 - 66:51)
be close to me that entire time he could (66:47 - 66:54)
go across the street to Ikea me and WI (66:51 - 66:56)
yeah yeah you go to Ikea and ik get (66:54 - 66:58)
myself a (66:56 - 67:01)
book um and then the other thing is uh (66:58 - 67:04)
that if I join a raid Greg and will (67:01 - 67:06)
would automatically get the invites to (67:04 - 67:09)
it and then it wouldn't use your five (67:06 - 67:12)
invites or whatever um and then that (67:09 - 67:14)
there would be like a power boost cuz (67:12 - 67:16)
we're in a party together MH so that was (67:14 - 67:20)
like kind of the gist of it (67:16 - 67:24)
uh I supposedly you'll also be able to (67:20 - 67:27)
see your party members on the map yes if (67:24 - 67:30)
they say yes which they have to consent (67:27 - 67:32)
to but is something that sounds kind of (67:30 - 67:35)
cool so that's a thing in (67:32 - 67:38)
Pikmin um if if (67:35 - 67:41)
you that that is that was a toggle in (67:38 - 67:44)
Pikmin so you can when you're planting (67:41 - 67:47)
flowers you can appear on the map and (67:44 - 67:48)
then if people are close to you you can (67:47 - 67:50)
see other people planting flowers but (67:48 - 67:53)
they have to opt in to show that so if (67:50 - 67:55)
like (67:53 - 67:56)
we were at Mall of America together and (67:55 - 67:58)
you were planting flowers and I were (67:56 - 67:59)
planting flowers if we looked at the (67:58 - 68:00)
game you would see both of our (67:59 - 68:03)
characters like skipping around like I I (68:00 - 68:05)
I don't know if there's like a lot (68:03 - 68:08)
of it's like a novelty thing to be like (68:05 - 68:09)
oh there's everyone on the map together (68:08 - 68:13)
I don't know I don't know if like if (68:09 - 68:16)
Greg leaves and like walks to Ikea if (68:13 - 68:18)
his character is like in the game (68:16 - 68:21)
physically going to leave the group I I (68:18 - 68:23)
would imagine not I would imagine it (68:21 - 68:25)
just puts you together it follows you (68:23 - 68:29)
but I I don't know the details of (68:25 - 68:33)
that um again hopefully this is okay to (68:29 - 68:34)
talk about it was very ear early in the (68:33 - 68:35)
morning when they were like here's our (68:34 - 68:37)
press conference and I do remember one (68:35 - 68:38)
of the questions being like hey can we (68:37 - 68:40)
talk about this and they were like yeah (68:38 - 68:43)
just don't like show the slides from the (68:40 - 68:44)
keynote or whatever I was (68:43 - 68:49)
like sure um it seems like a very simple (68:44 - 68:52)
thing um (68:49 - 68:57)
overall uh I understand the appeal of (68:52 - 69:01)
like let's like group up and catch a (68:57 - 69:03)
like however many Pokemon together like (69:01 - 69:08)
that's like fun I totally get that uh it (69:03 - 69:11)
it would be awkward though for people (69:08 - 69:14)
that have like a friend group of five (69:11 - 69:18)
cuz it only goes up to four yeah so uh (69:14 - 69:20)
that's awkward but that's like every (69:18 - 69:22)
game like man I remember when o wasn't (69:20 - 69:25)
OverWatch like a game of six and then (69:22 - 69:27)
like they were like we actually removing (69:25 - 69:29)
a character so could you imagine being (69:27 - 69:30)
like a competitive OverWatch team of (69:29 - 69:32)
like six people and they're like hey (69:30 - 69:34)
we're going down to a team of five like (69:32 - 69:36)
who's getting kicked off yeah who's (69:34 - 69:39)
getting kicked off the team like like (69:36 - 69:41)
Pokemon go is not the first game to have (69:39 - 69:44)
like specific groups of people so I am (69:41 - 69:46)
like that was the first thing in my head (69:44 - 69:47)
is like oh man what if you were in a (69:46 - 69:50)
friend group of like five like if you're (69:47 - 69:51)
in a friend group of six you could at (69:50 - 69:53)
least break off into two groups of three (69:51 - 69:54)
I guess you could do with group of three (69:53 - 69:56)
and a group of two I don't know what the (69:54 - 69:58)
rewards are though like I don't know if (69:56 - 70:01)
like you get better rewards if you're in (69:58 - 70:03)
a group of four versus a group of two I (70:01 - 70:05)
would assume (70:03 - 70:08)
so but I don't I don't I don't know even (70:05 - 70:10)
that has been data mind I think but (70:08 - 70:12)
maybe I should ask that (70:10 - 70:16)
question it kind of feels like uh tell (70:12 - 70:18)
me if if I'm the only one who thinks (70:16 - 70:19)
this but it kind of feels like when (70:18 - 70:21)
you're going to someone's world in (70:19 - 70:23)
Animal Crossing and you can all kind of (70:21 - 70:27)
fish together or play together that way (70:23 - 70:29)
that it's not super interactive but (70:27 - 70:30)
you're all kind of there and playing (70:29 - 70:33)
together yeah (70:30 - 70:33)
yeah yes I mean that's kind I felt in (70:34 - 70:39)
scarlet and violet like you can go to (70:37 - 70:41)
the other person's world and you can (70:39 - 70:42)
like walk around with them but the only (70:41 - 70:43)
thing you're really doing is like (70:42 - 70:46)
bringing their frame rate down and (70:43 - 70:49)
making their Mountain (70:46 - 70:52)
visible I mean for like Community (70:49 - 70:55)
Day why why not like why not yeah yeah (70:52 - 70:57)
for Community it sounds like the perfect (70:55 - 71:01)
situation but also again if you have a (70:57 - 71:03)
large group you're going to have to be (71:01 - 71:06)
like okay group one here group two here (71:03 - 71:10)
and like do the count because oh we have (71:06 - 71:12)
13 people today so we're going to have (71:10 - 71:13)
to (71:12 - 71:16)
form two groups of four and then a (71:13 - 71:19)
couple of groups of three yeah but (71:16 - 71:22)
that's not too hard yeah it's just it's (71:19 - 71:25)
just especially if you're in person yeah (71:22 - 71:28)
it's just sort of like all right there (71:25 - 71:30)
has to be a line somewhere I guess I (71:28 - 71:32)
don't know why probably because it will (71:30 - 71:34)
kill your frame rate but (71:32 - 71:37)
sure yeah I don't know if like in the (71:34 - 71:39)
future they're going to you could do (71:37 - 71:41)
like a group of 10 I also like don't (71:39 - 71:44)
know what are the only thing I remember (71:41 - 71:46)
them saying is like as a group catch (71:44 - 71:47)
this many Pokemon I was like yeah that (71:46 - 71:49)
makes sense but I don't know what the (71:47 - 71:50)
other challenges would be is it like as (71:49 - 71:54)
a group spin more Poké stops is it a (71:50 - 71:55)
group hatch a bunch of egg I would (71:54 - 71:58)
assume those would be like complete (71:55 - 72:00)
however many research tasks earn this (71:58 - 72:03)
much Stardust but also if it's something (72:00 - 72:06)
like as a group hatch 10 eggs and I (72:03 - 72:08)
don't buy incubators Greg doesn't buy (72:06 - 72:14)
incubators and like is the hatch again I (72:08 - 72:15)
have no clue if it's hatch 10 eggs this (72:14 - 72:18)
is just an example if if the hatch 10 (72:15 - 72:20)
eggs is like what like your reward is (72:18 - 72:23)
like 10 pokeballs like that's not worth (72:20 - 72:26)
yeah question is is how good the rewards (72:23 - 72:28)
will be like I can't imagine they're (72:26 - 72:31)
going to be super great that it's just (72:28 - 72:33)
like hey this is an extra bonus I feel (72:31 - 72:36)
like I don't think the research things (72:33 - 72:39)
will be much more than catch this many (72:36 - 72:41)
and spin this many things like I imagine (72:39 - 72:42)
that's what it's going to focus on and (72:41 - 72:44)
the rewards be a nice boost I think it's (72:42 - 72:49)
just like to me the idea seems like (72:44 - 72:49)
let let's do the thing that we should (72:50 - 72:54)
have done the entire time and give extra (72:52 - 72:56)
rewards if you're playing in person with (72:54 - 72:59)
community so it's like what we wanted (72:56 - 73:01)
them to do was like come up with a way (72:59 - 73:04)
to reward people for getting together (73:01 - 73:07)
I'm just hoping that the rewards aren't (73:04 - 73:10)
so stunning that again it feels (73:07 - 73:11)
punishing if you (73:10 - 73:13)
don't have a group of people around you (73:11 - 73:15)
like if you're in a rural area I just (73:13 - 73:18)
hope it's like a nice little boost a fun (73:15 - 73:21)
little extra thing when you're all (73:18 - 73:22)
together and not (73:21 - 73:24)
like (73:22 - 73:29)
another way to you know say too bad you (73:24 - 73:32)
live in a rural area or can't by yeah (73:29 - 73:36)
like I I you know when it comes to being (73:32 - 73:38)
in like a big city like Boston or (73:36 - 73:41)
Chicago or Tokyo or (73:38 - 73:44)
whatever you you don't have the same (73:41 - 73:48)
issues that somebody who lives (73:44 - 73:56)
in uh like Fondulac has um which is like (73:48 - 73:57)
you know if if Greg and I are playing at (73:56 - 74:00)
Mall of America we never need Pokeballs (73:57 - 74:03)
that is just never an issue that will (74:00 - 74:06)
exist like although we W paying today we (74:03 - 74:09)
both ran out we did yeah we did run out (74:06 - 74:11)
but (74:09 - 74:13)
literally wait what's happening oh we're (74:11 - 74:15)
out of pokeballs literally when we ran (74:13 - 74:18)
out I just switched my Pokeball Plus+ to (74:15 - 74:20)
just spin stops and within minutes I was (74:18 - 74:23)
at 50 pokeballs again like that's that's (74:20 - 74:26)
just not an issue for like City players (74:23 - 74:27)
so like I could imagine if you like (74:26 - 74:29)
lived in a town with like three Poké (74:27 - 74:33)
stops and one gym and so Community Day (74:29 - 74:35)
is probably you know not super good (74:33 - 74:36)
maybe that that's like all in like your (74:35 - 74:38)
very small playground park or whatever (74:36 - 74:41)
like down the street from a bar (74:38 - 74:44)
like I could I totally understand like (74:41 - 74:46)
playing together even if it's like with (74:44 - 74:48)
your brother or your mom or or or your (74:46 - 74:50)
friend is like okay this is giving us (74:48 - 74:52)
more pokeballs or something and that's (74:50 - 74:54)
making the experience better totally (74:52 - 74:57)
understand that um but I I think Greg (74:54 - 74:59)
makes a great point of you know on this (74:57 - 75:00)
show (74:59 - 75:04)
and Niantic has on the show we've said (75:00 - 75:06)
like Niantic needs to incentivize group (75:04 - 75:09)
play this is an actual way to (75:06 - 75:12)
incentivize group play or I shouldn't (75:09 - 75:13)
say Group Play I shouldn't say like (75:12 - 75:16)
incentivize not playing on your couch (75:13 - 75:19)
yeah which is what the pandemic turned (75:16 - 75:22)
that game into (75:19 - 75:24)
um and see all the time on their post (75:22 - 75:27)
right like even on the What's this (75:24 - 75:28)
called Party play even on the party play (75:27 - 75:30)
post people are like you know what would (75:28 - 75:32)
be better than Party play a dollar (75:30 - 75:34)
remote rate passes like there are there (75:32 - 75:35)
are still (75:34 - 75:38)
people there are still people out there (75:35 - 75:41)
that the game to than this a winning (75:38 - 75:42)
lottery (75:41 - 75:46)
ticket sure you're not gonna get it uh (75:42 - 75:48)
I'll yeah I I I don't think it's (75:46 - 75:51)
happening uh you know the game to those (75:48 - 75:53)
people where I want to sit on my couch I (75:51 - 75:55)
want to remote in and I want to roll the (75:53 - 75:57)
slot machine that is one in 20 chance (75:55 - 76:00)
for a legend like that that was fun to (75:57 - 76:03)
people uh maybe not to their (76:00 - 76:07)
wallet um but you know that was fun to (76:03 - 76:10)
people and then so what we said and what (76:07 - 76:11)
a lot of people said instead of (76:10 - 76:14)
punishing everyone if you want people to (76:11 - 76:16)
go out and play your video game make it (76:14 - 76:19)
more enjoyable or give us a reason to go (76:16 - 76:20)
out and play your video game instead of (76:19 - 76:24)
just making everyone's experience bad (76:20 - 76:28)
so this is a a thing that I (76:24 - 76:31)
mean we'll see if this works I don't (76:28 - 76:33)
think anyone who's jaded about raid (76:31 - 76:35)
passes is ever going to be convinced or (76:33 - 76:37)
ever going to be (76:35 - 76:39)
happy but for the people who do go out (76:37 - 76:41)
like for the people who do go out for (76:39 - 76:43)
commun day which is I think a lot of (76:41 - 76:47)
people I I think and I think commun day (76:43 - 76:49)
is probably niantic's best day of the (76:47 - 76:52)
month for for revenue and for players (76:49 - 76:54)
and everything uh (76:52 - 76:57)
um I hope that this somewhat help like I (76:54 - 76:58)
don't think it's going to help me I (76:57 - 76:59)
don't think it's going to help me and (76:58 - 77:01)
Greg when we're walking around Mall of (76:59 - 77:03)
America like I I don't need any more (77:01 - 77:05)
pokeballs maybe this maybe if it's (77:03 - 77:07)
Stardust or something that'd be nice I (77:05 - 77:09)
guess but like not that big of a deal (77:07 - 77:11)
but I mean I'm not going say no we're (77:09 - 77:13)
already there right right but again for (77:11 - 77:15)
somebody that maybe doesn't have the (77:13 - 77:17)
luxury of a big city hopefully that (77:15 - 77:20)
makes it better for them that's cool uh (77:17 - 77:22)
but I I don't know like I said I they (77:20 - 77:24)
they gave us a small (77:22 - 77:26)
preview it looks exactly what you think (77:24 - 77:29)
it would be um like there's no huge (77:26 - 77:32)
surprises there the only huge surprise (77:29 - 77:35)
is that the rewards keep getting better (77:32 - 77:37)
and better and so you want I again I (77:35 - 77:39)
don't know I one of the things they said (77:37 - 77:40)
was catch a bunch of Pokemon and you'll (77:39 - 77:42)
complete the thing together I don't know (77:40 - 77:45)
if it's you know catch 30 catch 50 catch (77:42 - 77:49)
100 catch two like do they get better do (77:45 - 77:50)
does it feel like you want to rush (77:49 - 77:52)
through them maybe there's only like (77:50 - 77:54)
three levels and you get done in 20 (77:52 - 77:56)
minutes and that's it like I I don't (77:54 - 77:59)
know um but there's (77:56 - 78:03)
potential so that that's (77:59 - 78:05)
cool it seems like a neat feature I'm (78:03 - 78:07)
looking forward to seeing it in game (78:05 - 78:10)
hopefully my ankle will be healed by (78:07 - 78:13)
then the thing I think of (78:10 - 78:16)
is the other thing I think of is like if (78:13 - 78:18)
you do go to Community Day um and I've (78:16 - 78:21)
seen this uh like I I've gone to (78:18 - 78:23)
community day as a solo player like that (78:21 - 78:25)
that was a lot of my experience in (78:23 - 78:26)
Milwaukee I used to play with people (78:25 - 78:29)
those people stopped playing Community (78:26 - 78:31)
Day and or played Community Day in (78:29 - 78:33)
places that I did not want to play like (78:31 - 78:35)
their car I don't want to play in a car (78:33 - 78:37)
um so there was plenty of community days (78:35 - 78:40)
where I played solo I wonder if the (78:37 - 78:44)
rewards would be good enough to be (78:40 - 78:46)
like maybe I should talk to a couple (78:44 - 78:48)
people and be like hey let's start a (78:46 - 78:50)
party and then like we don't have to (78:48 - 78:52)
like stick around like I don't have to (78:50 - 78:54)
like follow you for the next hour but (78:52 - 78:56)
like maybe let's exchange friend codes (78:54 - 78:59)
maybe like jump into a party and then (78:56 - 79:00)
I'm sure that is part of the intent of (78:59 - 79:02)
this yeah and that that's like that's (79:00 - 79:05)
super cool and hopefully that works but (79:02 - 79:07)
but like if the reward is just like 10 (79:05 - 79:10)
pokeballs like I I'll continue being (79:07 - 79:12)
antisocial I don't need the 10 Pokeballs (79:10 - 79:13)
that (79:12 - 79:17)
much but again I think I think this is (79:13 - 79:20)
uh I think this this could have a lot of (79:17 - 79:24)
potential to do what Niantic wants to do (79:20 - 79:28)
which is you know social (79:24 - 79:31)
interaction but uh the rewards would (79:28 - 79:32)
have to be good right I don't think I've (79:31 - 79:34)
seen anything about a metal that goes (79:32 - 79:36)
with it but if there was metal that goes (79:34 - 79:38)
with it that could incentivize a little (79:36 - 79:39)
bit more if you don't need a few (79:38 - 79:41)
pokeballs but want another Platinum (79:39 - 79:43)
metal yeah that's (79:41 - 79:45)
true (79:43 - 79:49)
um but yeah I seems okay uh there could (79:45 - 79:51)
probably be a whole other argument about (79:49 - 79:52)
maybe you should fix Roots before you (79:51 - 79:55)
introduce a new feature (79:52 - 79:58)
but you know hey I got a zygard sell (79:55 - 80:00)
today it work I got a zygard sell today (79:58 - 80:01)
for the first time ever and I didn't (80:00 - 80:05)
have to walk into the middle of a lake (80:01 - 80:10)
wo so uh you know Easy Come Easy (80:05 - 80:14)
Go um last bit of news here uh before we (80:10 - 80:16)
wrap up is uh we just didn't touch on (80:14 - 80:18)
the fouryear anniversary for Pokemon (80:16 - 80:22)
Masters now that it's out um a lot of (80:18 - 80:24)
that stuff is like slowly wrapping up in (80:22 - 80:26)
the next couple days but they did the (80:24 - 80:30)
the neoch champion stuff of of red blue (80:26 - 80:32)
leaf that was kind of like the big (80:30 - 80:36)

roxan oh I think you're right I think it (81:09 - 81:13)
is roxan I think yeah it's roxan (81:11 - 81:16)
Ro so they're they're shifting away from (81:13 - 81:18)
their fouryear anniversary to their (81:16 - 81:21)
their uh fall stuff also um I think this (81:18 - 81:23)
will end in a couple days but they did a (81:21 - 81:26)
little bit of Legend stuff with um uh (81:23 - 81:29)
whoever the main character girl was for (81:26 - 81:31)
Legends she had samur Ro and then the (81:29 - 81:33)
the dude they weren't like Dawn and (81:31 - 81:35)
Lucas but they were like based off Don (81:33 - 81:37)
and Lucas yeah that storyline was kind (81:35 - 81:41)
of cute and weird the dude had uh deui (81:37 - 81:44)
yeah but no one had tyan (81:41 - 81:48)
no short end the stick again for gen two (81:44 - 81:52)
the story of of Don and Lucas (81:48 - 81:53)
meeting (81:52 - 81:56)
break (81:53 - 81:56)
Breaky I'm not having a name day today (81:58 - 82:03)
but their whole thing of them running (82:01 - 82:04)
into each other and realizing that they (82:03 - 82:07)
look like each other and being (82:04 - 82:11)
like why do you look like me like it was (82:07 - 82:13)
it's a it they did it they played with (82:11 - 82:17)
it it's look the whole hu storyline in (82:13 - 82:19)
Masters is great it's much better than (82:17 - 82:20)
what they've done in Scarlet Violet (82:19 - 82:22)
which is like they just throw them in (82:20 - 82:24)
like they've actually came through A (82:22 - 82:26)
Spacetime Distortion they're like (82:24 - 82:27)
actually talking about how things (82:26 - 82:28)
differently work and they're trying to (82:27 - 82:31)
figure out what it all means and that (82:28 - 82:33)
the various people from the timeline are (82:31 - 82:35)
like in this new future where everything (82:33 - 82:37)
is different and how they interact with (82:35 - 82:39)
Pokemon so there's been good story lines (82:37 - 82:43)
about how they deal with being in this (82:39 - 82:45)
world that is very very different than (82:43 - 82:48)
where they so it's been it was really (82:45 - 82:50)
Charming it's cute like my masters has a (82:48 - 82:52)
good thing at making me care about all (82:50 - 82:55)
of characters that had no no personality (82:52 - 82:58)
in any of the game like I know all of (82:55 - 83:01)
these gy leaders now where I'm like oh I (82:58 - 83:03)
like them because I I take them to the (83:01 - 83:06)
smooching booth and we go on dates all (83:03 - 83:09)
time do (83:06 - 83:13)
you like it's it's so hard for me to put (83:09 - 83:16)
thoughts for the fouryear anniversary (83:13 - 83:18)
cuz I I don't play that much right like (83:16 - 83:21)
I'll log in I'll get my daily gems I (83:18 - 83:24)
play every day uh (83:21 - 83:26)
so for me it was like okay this is the (83:24 - 83:28)
event I pulled on the characters I (83:26 - 83:29)
pulled all three all right I'll see you (83:28 - 83:32)
next event cuz I saved I saved forever (83:29 - 83:35)
for these it didn't for it didn't feel (83:32 - 83:37)
like an anniversary I guess I mean they (83:35 - 83:39)
gave the 3,000 gems they gave the 100 (83:37 - 83:41)
free characters the shocking thing is (83:39 - 83:44)
like oh Masters is four years old that's (83:41 - 83:47)
crazy like yeah I mean the the actual (83:44 - 83:49)
Neo event (83:47 - 83:52)
storyline did feel like a good Masters (83:49 - 83:55)
event like like them talking through you (83:52 - 83:57)
know who these characters are and why (83:55 - 83:58)
the way they are so if like you played (83:57 - 84:00)
the storyline event instead of just (83:58 - 84:01)
pulling on them you know it did have the (84:00 - 84:04)
anniversary feel to it like we know (84:01 - 84:09)
here's there characters we're building (84:04 - 84:09)
storyline I (84:09 - 84:15)
think it's just old it's just a (84:12 - 84:17)
four-year-old game like you're (84:15 - 84:20)
not those of us who play it are like the (84:17 - 84:23)
I I play it for these characters now (84:20 - 84:25)
because that's what this game is is me (84:23 - 84:28)
knowing who these people are why they (84:25 - 84:29)
have these things how they're (84:28 - 84:32)
interacting with the world the storyline (84:29 - 84:34)
like the whole villains Arc like they're (84:32 - 84:36)
they've created their own unique Team (84:34 - 84:40)
Rocket event storyline that like got (84:36 - 84:43)
very invested in and they did a whole (84:40 - 84:46)
bunch of things so like if you're (84:43 - 84:48)
heavily into the game storyline like (84:46 - 84:50)
yeah I I felt like it was a great (84:48 - 84:53)
anniversary event like the the pairs (84:50 - 84:57)
made sense they did them for a reason (84:53 - 84:59)
the storyline was good the Halloween (84:57 - 85:01)
event is good you know they've done a (84:59 - 85:03)
lot of cute things but I just (85:01 - 85:06)
think you know the blossoms off that (85:03 - 85:10)
flower four years old you know they (85:06 - 85:13)
added two brand new types to the game (85:10 - 85:15)
which was a huge thing they added speed (85:13 - 85:16)
type and this (85:15 - 85:19)
new they had the Speed type and they (85:16 - 85:21)
added the Dual typing thing so you're (85:19 - 85:24)
like attack type with a tech bonus you (85:21 - 85:27)
unlock it with the with the tech cake so (85:24 - 85:30)
like they've made the game deeper but (85:27 - 85:33)
like you really have to be invested in (85:30 - 85:35)
Masters I think to really get a lot out (85:33 - 85:38)
of the anniversary events at this point (85:35 - 85:40)
it's pretty settled into what it is yeah (85:38 - 85:42)
it knows what it is it knows what it (85:40 - 85:45)
does it what it does is makes (85:42 - 85:48)
interesting pairings and tells a decent (85:45 - 85:52)
story just like we all know anniversary (85:48 - 85:54)
bed now are for unite or let's just (85:52 - 85:55)
completely destroy the meta with a (85:54 - 85:57)
legendary and then not fix (85:55 - 86:01)
it that is our anniversary event I think (85:57 - 86:03)
the (86:01 - 86:07)
the for my I I I have maybe like a (86:03 - 86:11)
unique perspective in the sense (86:07 - 86:14)
that um like I will I will make a (86:11 - 86:17)
master's video for YouTube like maybe (86:14 - 86:20)
once a month cuz I have DNA gives me a (86:17 - 86:22)
bunch of free gems I I get my daily gem (86:20 - 86:25)
I'll do a video DNA will be like thanks (86:22 - 86:27)
for the video here's some more gems like (86:25 - 86:29)
that's it that's like the exchange just (86:27 - 86:31)
disclosure of that but like when I put (86:29 - 86:33)
the video (86:31 - 86:36)
out this and again this is just a (86:33 - 86:40)
perspective thing um it always does (86:36 - 86:44)
bad um like it does poorly and so I I (86:40 - 86:47)
look of like okay like Pokemon's a (86:44 - 86:50)
pretty big brand this game is obviously (86:47 - 86:52)
a gotta game there's nothing wrong with (86:50 - 86:54)
that there's not a lot of Pokemon Master (86:52 - 86:57)
creators out there but when you look at (86:54 - 87:01)
other gotcha games um so for example I (86:57 - 87:04)
was like well like hanai Star rail is (87:01 - 87:07)
what like 6 months old now and you know (87:04 - 87:08)
it was just featured at Apple's keynote (87:07 - 87:10)
of being like this very popular game (87:08 - 87:11)
It's featured in the App Store all the (87:10 - 87:14)
time and you go to like uh like I could (87:11 - 87:16)
just go to YouTube and type in hanon Kai (87:14 - 87:19)
star rail gotcha or hankai Star rail (87:16 - 87:21)
poles and it's the same thing it's the (87:19 - 87:24)
same YouTube video of like hey I got all (87:21 - 87:26)
these gems let's pull on the brand new (87:24 - 87:29)
character like it's not that different (87:26 - 87:32)
of content the difference is they have (87:29 - 87:34)
thousands of (87:32 - 87:37)
views and like even when you go back to (87:34 - 87:40)
Pokemon Masters four years ago and you (87:37 - 87:43)
look at big every big Pokemon YouTuber (87:40 - 87:45)
jumped on the Masters bandwagon because (87:43 - 87:48)
it was brand new the views don't even (87:45 - 87:52)
compare to a genin impact or a or a (87:48 - 87:56)
hanai star rail so I'm just I guess my (87:52 - 87:59)
perspective is like how does Pokemon (87:56 - 88:03)
have such a huge influential brand and (87:59 - 88:07)
this game just doesn't seem like it hit (88:03 - 88:10)
the audience that it wants it to hit (88:07 - 88:14)
like like Greg is 100% right gosh I'm (88:10 - 88:16)
I'm really pumping Greg up this episode (88:14 - 88:20)
yeah as in like like Masters did this (88:16 - 88:22)
pivot of we want you to care about these (88:20 - 88:24)
gym leaders and we want you to care (88:22 - 88:26)
about these these trainers and we're g (88:24 - 88:29)
to make these in my opinion really (88:26 - 88:32)
decent stories of these events and maybe (88:29 - 88:33)
that's why I didn't feel like the foure (88:32 - 88:35)
anniversary was like that impactful to (88:33 - 88:37)
me CU I I didn't get a chance to do the (88:35 - 88:38)
event because I was traveling in South (88:37 - 88:41)
Korea (88:38 - 88:44)
um but like isn't that what Pokemon fan (88:41 - 88:47)
like like gotcha games are popular and (88:44 - 88:51)
to have a Pokemon Gotta game makes sense (88:47 - 88:53)
so it's crazy to to me that like a game (88:51 - 88:54)
like hongkai Star I'm not saying Hong (88:53 - 88:56)
Kai star is bad like it got really good (88:54 - 88:59)
reviews like Hoya verse is very good at (88:56 - 89:01)
making gacha games but you have to (88:59 - 89:05)
like you have (89:01 - 89:05)
no uh you have no clue who these (89:05 - 89:11)
characters are in hanai without playing (89:09 - 89:14)
that game so you have to like it feels (89:11 - 89:16)
like the barrier to entry is just so (89:14 - 89:18)
much higher for that game versus like a (89:16 - 89:19)
Pokemon game where the buried entry (89:18 - 89:22)
seems very low of like uh I mean gotta (89:19 - 89:26)
games I really like Pokemon this game is (89:22 - 89:30)
established like why why are my YouTube (89:26 - 89:32)
videos not getting views that's the (89:30 - 89:34)
real but you know what I'm saying like (89:32 - 89:35)
why are these other Goa games just (89:34 - 89:37)
blowing it out of the water one of the (89:35 - 89:41)
weird things is unlike I played genjin (89:37 - 89:43)
impact for a while like the units that (89:41 - 89:44)
you (89:43 - 89:48)
pick really affect at how well you can (89:44 - 89:50)
play that game (89:48 - 89:54)
and for Masters unless you really want (89:50 - 89:59)
to go for the hardcore gamepl which most (89:54 - 90:01)
I don't think a lot of people do units (89:59 - 90:05)
just don't Banner them like pulling a (90:01 - 90:06)
new unit of a (90:05 - 90:09)
fourstar from a player perspective of (90:06 - 90:11)
getting through the (90:09 - 90:14)
content that doesn't really matter (90:11 - 90:18)
like what matters is the storyline and (90:14 - 90:19)
having the appropriate characters for (90:18 - 90:22)
that story line gets you better Rewards (90:19 - 90:26)
but they are by no means necessary to (90:22 - 90:28)
actually complete that story line like I (90:26 - 90:30)
have one Halloween unit I have the Sab (90:28 - 90:32)
eye unit I can still get a ton of (90:30 - 90:35)
rewards for the entire Halloween event I (90:32 - 90:37)
just don't get as many of them but I can (90:35 - 90:39)
do the whole thing with what I have so (90:37 - 90:42)
there's not as much (90:39 - 90:45)
excitement when you pull a banner of (90:42 - 90:47)
thinking this is going to radically (90:45 - 90:51)
change my game unless you're into the (90:47 - 90:54)
hard content like going for the going (90:51 - 90:57)
for the cake to unlock the teex spec of (90:54 - 91:01)
a striker is a high-end game thing that (90:57 - 91:05)
will never come up to 90% of the players (91:01 - 91:07)
I'm doing it because it's just another (91:05 - 91:09)
thing I complete every day and once I (91:07 - 91:11)
have it I will probably unlock it and (91:09 - 91:14)
that will be the extent of my interest (91:11 - 91:17)
in it (91:14 - 91:17)
because the units don't matter as much (91:17 - 91:24)
for game play they matter for story but (91:21 - 91:27)
they don't make pulling the unit (91:24 - 91:29)
necessary to complete story you don't (91:27 - 91:32)
have to have them and it's just I I (91:29 - 91:35)
appreciate it on some level but also (91:32 - 91:39)
it's it is weird from an outsider (91:35 - 91:42)
perspective because a lot of the banners (91:39 - 91:43)
like well should you pull on this banner (91:42 - 91:45)
and a lot of the answers is like I don't (91:43 - 91:48)
know man do you like do you like it it's (91:45 - 91:50)
really not going to change your gaml (91:48 - 91:53)
like are you are you a hardcore player (91:50 - 91:56)
then yeah like this will fill in a gap (91:53 - 91:59)
but otherwise no like the two Halloween (91:56 - 92:02)
things aren't particularly great but (91:59 - 92:04)
people are pulling on them because they (92:02 - 92:06)
like you know Phoebe and Rox and they (92:04 - 92:08)
think their outfits are cute but again I (92:06 - 92:11)
can do the entire Halloween event (92:08 - 92:15)
without them I get to see them in the (92:11 - 92:16)
they're in the game people out there (92:15 - 92:19)
really like roxan come (92:16 - 92:19)
on she has like a nose pad or whatever (92:20 - 92:26)
not now she's go to (92:23 - 92:26)
Rodriguez Morty's got a ho for the audio (92:26 - 92:32)
podcast listeners Hannah (92:30 - 92:36)
was very maybe a little bit offended (92:32 - 92:39)
maybe a little (92:36 - 92:39)
bit yeah I just I just it it's it's not (92:39 - 92:45)
me complaining like my Master's video (92:43 - 92:48)
didn't do super well it's just I just (92:45 - 92:50)
think the nature of (92:48 - 92:53)
polling is vast different in those two (92:50 - 92:57)
games because pulling in genin Impact (92:53 - 93:02)
pulling a a top star character will (92:57 - 93:06)
really change your game play and it just (93:02 - 93:08)
I just I just it just doesn't in Masters (93:06 - 93:10)
they (93:08 - 93:13)
really yeah I (93:10 - 93:17)
uh I I I would love (93:13 - 93:21)
to maybe like talk to somebody and have (93:17 - 93:25)
like a deeper convers ation of like what (93:21 - 93:28)
the appeal of just because like there's (93:25 - 93:32)
a going like you you can find YouTube (93:28 - 93:34)
videos and I know YouTube is like very (93:32 - 93:35)
specific but you can find YouTube videos (93:34 - 93:38)
of like how do I play Masters better how (93:35 - 93:41)
do I build a team to defeat this how is (93:38 - 93:43)
this character worth pulling and then on (93:41 - 93:45)
the then you can find simpler content (93:43 - 93:47)
content I would do which is like hey (93:45 - 93:49)
there's a new event did you pull that (93:47 - 93:51)
character how many gems did you spend (93:49 - 93:52)
it's very similar to like opening a pack (93:51 - 93:54)
of Pokémon cards right like it's very (93:52 - 93:56)
similar content of like did they pull (93:54 - 93:59)
the Charizard from the Scarlet 151 set (93:56 - 94:01)
right like so there's like two types of (93:59 - 94:05)
content but when you look at hanai or (94:01 - 94:08)
whatever other gacha game and it it's (94:05 - 94:10)
that content of I'm just pulling on the (94:08 - 94:14)
new character new banner and it has (94:10 - 94:18)
just 300 times the amount of views and (94:14 - 94:19)
that's not even comparing to my channel (94:18 - 94:22)
I could find a bigger Masters (94:19 - 94:25)
YouTube Creator and it it it's it's the (94:22 - 94:26)
same it's like 300 times the amount of (94:25 - 94:30)
views and it's like you as a as a hanai (94:26 - 94:32)
full-time YouTuber did not exist six (94:30 - 94:33)
months ago cuz that game didn't exist (94:32 - 94:37)
two six months ago so it's like I want (94:33 - 94:40)
to I I I want to know what the draw is (94:37 - 94:42)
in that specific Goa because I've (94:40 - 94:44)
watched people play hanai it's it's (94:42 - 94:47)
repetitive gameplay right like you go (94:44 - 94:49)
through you do the same story Loop they (94:47 - 94:51)
add more content but still and there's (94:49 - 94:54)
nothing wrong with that I'm not I get it (94:51 - 94:55)
I played the gotta games I understand (94:54 - 94:56)
that the game play is repetitive you get (94:55 - 94:58)
better you get faster you get more (94:56 - 95:00)
rewards you do your (94:58 - 95:03)
dailies but something Hoya vers is doing (95:00 - 95:06)
over there is is really gravitating (95:03 - 95:07)
people and probably bringing more people (95:06 - 95:09)
in and that's always a thing that's on (95:07 - 95:11)
my top of my head is like you got a game (95:09 - 95:14)
that's four years old with a huge fan (95:11 - 95:18)
base that would fly to Amsterdam to get (95:14 - 95:20)
a plush (95:18 - 95:23)
and you're not ATT rting an audience (95:20 - 95:27)
like a brand new franchise is from six (95:23 - 95:29)
months ago so I'm especially for a game (95:27 - 95:32)
that is about collecting things you're (95:29 - 95:34)
right right yeah you know the that's the (95:32 - 95:36)
part that doesn't quite make sense to me (95:34 - 95:39)
I mean I know a lot of people play it I (95:36 - 95:42)
I I just like when they have co-op (95:39 - 95:45)
things you never you are never waiting (95:42 - 95:47)
long you just say pick find me people to (95:45 - 95:49)
play with you are never waiting long (95:47 - 95:51)
there are people always playing that (95:49 - 95:54)
game it's just I I don't know that the (95:51 - 95:58)
audience of people playing that (95:54 - 95:58)
game is the same has the same interest (95:59 - 96:08)
in content about that game as other (96:04 - 96:13)
perhaps more provocative shall we say uh (96:08 - 96:15)
games and character models oh I see what (96:13 - 96:16)
you're (96:15 - 96:19)
saying I understand so you're saying if (96:16 - 96:22)
they put Giovani in a swimsuit that more (96:19 - 96:26)
people will play possibly I mean it it's (96:22 - 96:28)
you could also apply the same logic I'm (96:26 - 96:32)
using for Masters verse honai to um (96:28 - 96:35)
unite verse like League of Legends or or (96:32 - 96:39)
or Dota 2 or whatever other mobas are (96:35 - 96:41)
popular right now I'm not sure I I I'm (96:39 - 96:45)
curious to just see like which we'll (96:41 - 96:47)
never get like what is their actual (96:45 - 96:49)
breakdown of people playing game because (96:47 - 96:51)
they've been going for four years (96:49 - 96:54)
they've been going very strong their gem (96:51 - 96:55)
prices are still outrageous but I look (96:54 - 96:58)
at people and they buy them I mean I I (96:55 - 96:59)
did buy the super discounted gem pack (96:58 - 97:01)
for this house I'm like it's been four (96:59 - 97:05)
years I should give them some money (97:01 - 97:09)
finally so I bought a gem pack but just (97:05 - 97:12)
one Just One Look don't don't push me it (97:09 - 97:14)
was $23 like that's all you're getting (97:12 - 97:16)
out of me kids was a lot of gems though (97:14 - 97:17)
I remember seeing that pack that was a (97:16 - 97:19)
lot of gems it was a lot of gems it was (97:17 - 97:22)
a good deal but I'm curious what the (97:19 - 97:26)
breakdown is because I I just I know a (97:22 - 97:28)
lot of people are playing the game but I (97:26 - 97:30)
can't tell (97:28 - 97:32)
you like I have zero interest in (97:30 - 97:35)
watching other people pull like I I just (97:32 - 97:39)
don't I have zero desire to watch that (97:35 - 97:42)
content because I also just pulled them (97:39 - 97:44)
all on my (97:42 - 97:47)
own you know it's pretty it's it's a (97:44 - 97:48)
little bit easier now to pull on your (97:47 - 97:53)
own to see things and (97:48 - 97:53)
I I don't know I'm curious to see what (97:54 - 97:57)
their breakdown of demographics is (97:56 - 98:00)
because they are clearly going strong (97:57 - 98:01)
they clearly had a lot of people playing (98:00 - 98:04)
the game they clearly have like they do (98:01 - 98:07)
all their events they make their money I (98:04 - 98:07)
just (98:07 - 98:09)
curious like you said what the (98:07 - 98:12)
difference in the audience is that that (98:09 - 98:15)
doesn't seek out that (98:12 - 98:18)
content yeah I I I just think it's I (98:15 - 98:22)
just think it's interesting that like (98:18 - 98:24)
you would just assume that a Pokemon (98:22 - 98:28)
Gotta game about collecting trainers (98:24 - 98:32)
would feel like it was more impactful in (98:28 - 98:33)
the gaming (98:32 - 98:35)
space (98:33 - 98:38)
um and and that's not to that's not to (98:35 - 98:40)
say Masters is bad like I enjoy it when (98:38 - 98:44)
I play it I think it was kind of bad (98:40 - 98:46)
when it started oh terrible to started (98:44 - 98:49)
and they they they made it better yeah (98:46 - 98:51)
um and it's incredibly deep deep and (98:49 - 98:54)
complicated if you want it to be if you (98:51 - 98:56)
want it to (98:54 - 99:01)
be you can ignore a lot of that stuff so (98:56 - 99:03)
yeah I I I maybe maybe it's just more of (99:01 - 99:06)
a conversation of like Hoya versus doing (99:03 - 99:09)
something on another level to attract (99:06 - 99:14)
people in I maybe they have three games (99:09 - 99:18)
obviously genin and Then star rail um (99:14 - 99:21)
but you again the Pokemon brand is (99:18 - 99:23)
curious what's going to happen to genin (99:21 - 99:25)
in for you know I'm also curious what's (99:23 - 99:27)
going to happen to Star (99:25 - 99:30)
for um you know the one that was really (99:27 - 99:32)
really great that I played all the time (99:30 - 99:36)
dral I lost clothes like they did oh (99:32 - 99:37)
that was the Nintendo one yeah and (99:36 - 99:39)
they're like okay well we're done I (99:37 - 99:40)
think that was like what three years (99:39 - 99:42)
before they threw in the towel yeah it (99:40 - 99:44)
was three and a half I mean I could (99:42 - 99:45)
still launch the app I don't think (99:44 - 99:48)
anything's happening in it um but like (99:45 - 99:52)
I'm curious what happened to those games (99:48 - 99:56)
at the same time period are they still (99:52 - 99:58)
going to be running as WR because (99:56 - 100:01)
Masters is running on full Full engines (99:58 - 100:04)
full steam ahead um new stuff's coming (100:01 - 100:07)
out on a real Great Clip they're pumping (100:04 - 100:09)
money in they're pumping characters in (100:07 - 100:11)
like they are definitely making money (100:09 - 100:13)
much more than a lot of Goa games do it (100:11 - 100:15)
for you it's just I'm (100:13 - 100:18)
curious like there's such a difference (100:15 - 100:19)
in their (100:18 - 100:22)
audience and what what we're looking for (100:19 - 100:24)
versus what we're looking for in other (100:22 - 100:27)
thing um it it is an interesting it is (100:24 - 100:28)
definitely an (100:27 - 100:31)
interesting topic to sort of ponder but (100:28 - 100:34)
like it is it is the longest running (100:31 - 100:37)
gotta game that I've played other than (100:34 - 100:40)
Final Fantasy (100:37 - 100:43)
brave brave exit is that what the beat (100:40 - 100:45)
Dan work what that's been going on (100:43 - 100:47)
forever U but that's because Final (100:45 - 100:51)
Fantasy fans are are rapid so oh yeah (100:47 - 100:53)
they're like give me give me give me a (100:51 - 100:56)
new (100:53 - 100:56)
Yola uh well hey if you play a lot of (100:57 - 101:02)
Goa games and you're watching on YouTube (101:00 - 101:05)
uh comment below if you play genin or if (101:02 - 101:07)
you play genin and Masters or if you (101:05 - 101:09)
just play Masters or maybe you play (101:07 - 101:11)
another Goa game that's like existed for (101:09 - 101:13)
like five years that we haven't heard (101:11 - 101:15)
about I'm actually I'm just curious of (101:13 - 101:19)
like H what is the overlap of like Star (101:15 - 101:22)
Rail sgin and Masters player (101:19 - 101:25)
or maybe like no I know so many people (101:22 - 101:26)
who play both genin and Star Royale I (101:25 - 101:28)
don't think it's like a limit of like (101:26 - 101:31)
one gotta (101:28 - 101:33)
game I knew a person that played seven (101:31 - 101:35)
gacha games at one point there's like a (101:33 - 101:36)
Digimon gacha game too I think yeah (101:35 - 101:38)
there's a digimon one now yeah yeah yeah (101:36 - 101:40)
yeah I think I played that for like two (101:38 - 101:42)
days and I was like this is this is too (101:40 - 101:47)
much um although I do like Digimon um (101:42 - 101:49)
anyways thanks for making it to the end (101:47 - 101:52)
hey I finished Detective (101:49 - 101:53)
yeah we're going to talk about it next (101:52 - 101:58)
week I'm going to give you my rating (101:53 - 101:58)
now that game's (101:58 - 102:02)
overpriced we will talk about detective (102:05 - 102:11)
Pikachu next week I'm going to try to (102:08 - 102:12)
play through it on (102:11 - 102:14)
Twitch uh I'm going try to play through (102:12 - 102:16)
it one sitting Greg said that's going to (102:14 - 102:19)
be very imposs not you are not going to (102:16 - 102:22)
be able to do that good luck what if I (102:19 - 102:24)
just start at like 8800 am with a cup of (102:22 - 102:26)
coffee okay I'll see you on Thursday (102:24 - 102:29)
when you (102:26 - 102:29)
finish I got to go in and change Tech (102:32 - 102:39)
speed to fast right like God good luck (102:34 - 102:40)
good (102:39 - 102:43)
luck um yeah we'll talk about detective (102:40 - 102:45)
Pikachu next week so uh look I'm going (102:43 - 102:47)
to assume that there's three types of (102:45 - 102:49)
people out there number one the people (102:47 - 102:50)
who have already bought and played (102:49 - 102:53)
through detective Pik Pikachu number two (102:50 - 102:55)
the people who just want to watch (102:53 - 102:56)
somebody play detective Pikachu so they (102:55 - 102:59)
can save their 50 bucks and no four (102:56 - 103:01)
types of people number three would be (102:59 - 103:03)
somebody that has no interest in this (103:01 - 103:05)
game whatsoever and number four would be (103:03 - 103:08)
like the very rare I want it and I but I (103:05 - 103:12)
gotta wait till Christmas like yeah (103:08 - 103:13)
there's no like there's no one that's (103:12 - 103:16)
like maybe on the fence of getting it (103:13 - 103:17)
right like you probably either got it at (103:16 - 103:19)
launch or you're just like I'm just (103:17 - 103:21)
going to watch a YouTube play through or (103:19 - 103:24)
play through and save 50 bucks which is (103:21 - 103:29)
totally fair uh very fair for this it is (103:24 - 103:31)
overpriced um badly (103:29 - 103:35)
overpriced yeah I think it was 50 it's (103:31 - 103:38)
already less than a normal switch game (103:35 - 103:39)
yeah and it's (103:38 - 103:41)
overpriced (103:39 - 103:45)
yeah I got a tiktock of like an old uh (103:41 - 103:47)
like Sears catalog ad for (103:45 - 103:50)
Christmas and I went through it and I (103:47 - 103:51)
was like man I I feel like like I (103:50 - 103:53)
remember this catalog but the thing I (103:51 - 103:55)
didn't remember is there were like (103:53 - 103:59)
Nintendo 64 games that were $70 oh yeah (103:55 - 104:03)
I don't remember that oh yeah like there (103:59 - 104:05)
was there was also one that was like (104:03 - 104:07)
Sega Genesis Mortal Combat for the Sega (104:05 - 104:09)
Genesis was (104:07 - 104:13)
$70 oh yeah it was Unreal it's actually (104:09 - 104:14)
crazy to me that video games are still (104:13 - 104:18)
like around the $60 to $70 price (104:14 - 104:20)
range because I feel like they should be (104:18 - 104:22)
more (104:20 - 104:24)
especially like I mean a gallon of milk (104:22 - 104:28)
is like $30 at this point so like there (104:24 - 104:29)
is (104:28 - 104:31)
that look I'm not saying that things (104:29 - 104:33)
should be inflated it's just weird to me (104:31 - 104:36)
that for people if if you're like me and (104:33 - 104:38)
you grew up only buying Pokemon games (104:36 - 104:40)
for the most part and those were on (104:38 - 104:43)
handheld and so it was $30 $40 for a (104:40 - 104:46)
very long time 60 still feels like a lot (104:43 - 104:49)
yeah that's true I mean I started back (104:46 - 104:52)
with the Atari and Atari (104:49 - 104:56)
2600 was like $150 for the base for the (104:52 - 104:59)
for the player and then each each game (104:56 - 105:03)
was like 25 bucks so like and that that (104:59 - 105:06)
that thing couldn't do much (105:03 - 105:08)
so (105:06 - 105:11)
like prices are (105:08 - 105:13)
just what like Kiko Vision I remember (105:11 - 105:15)
was super expensive we really really (105:13 - 105:17)
wanted one and we were like please (105:15 - 105:18)
please please please please and they're (105:17 - 105:20)
like it's the only thing you're getting (105:18 - 105:22)
if we get this is really pricey and the (105:20 - 105:24)
games were (105:22 - 105:26)
expensive so the the first attack of (105:24 - 105:28)
Pikachu was like what 40 bucks cuz it (105:26 - 105:31)
was 3DS game maybe it was like 35 but (105:28 - 105:33)
probably 40 I don't remember so this (105:31 - 105:37)
one's 50 do you think it would have been (105:33 - 105:39)
40 should 40 is the price or you think (105:37 - 105:41)
cheap should have stayed at (105:39 - 105:43)
35 (105:41 - 105:47)
