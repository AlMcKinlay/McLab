it (2:00 - 2:02)
it well okay spoiler alert for (2:00 - 2:05)
eurovision (2:02 - 2:09)
italy one italy yeah (2:05 - 2:13)
but it was supposed to either be (2:09 - 2:16)
ireland or australia (2:13 - 2:20)
those were the two both of them (2:16 - 2:23)
didn't qualify for the final what (2:20 - 2:26)
are these things i don't care those are (2:23 - 2:26)
the two (2:26 - 2:28)
those are the only two places i care (2:26 - 2:30)
about currently look kangaroos are not (2:28 - 2:30)
europeans (2:30 - 2:34)
scotland even put anything in (2:30 - 2:35)
scotland not being an independent (2:34 - 2:37)
country at this point in time do not (2:35 - 2:38)
have that yeah so i don't care about (2:37 - 2:38)
that uh (2:38 - 2:42)
how is it al is on the show i am (2:38 - 2:45)
i learned more things about scotland i (2:42 - 2:47)
don't know what this independent country (2:45 - 2:48)
means what was that (2:47 - 2:51)
you can't say that america (2:48 - 2:54)
bought a war of independence to be free (2:51 - 2:55)
of scotland (2:54 - 2:59)
and we are scotland technically (2:55 - 3:03)
is it free it's a it's a really he has (2:59 - 3:05)
the keys (3:03 - 3:06)
thanks i mean you really don't want to (3:05 - 3:09)
get into this (3:06 - 3:10)
this is going to go this is going to go (3:09 - 3:13)
seriously political so quickly even the (3:10 - 3:14)
answer to that question (3:13 - 3:18)
is political all right it gets ugly fast (3:14 - 3:22)
we have we have al here (3:18 - 3:24)
we have gibbel community day coming up (3:22 - 3:25)
we have (3:24 - 3:29)
uh some tcg we got we got some (3:25 - 3:32)
a lot of tcg stuff do we have amazing (3:29 - 3:35)
25th anniversary (3:32 - 3:38)
songs to celebrate do we have (3:35 - 3:42)
an amazing 25th anniversary distribution (3:38 - 3:43)
to talk about (3:42 - 3:44)
or are we just going to say that the (3:43 - 3:46)
25th anniversary brought (3:44 - 3:50)
us shiny wulu (3:46 - 3:50)
we can start with the shiny wulu can we (3:50 - 3:53)
because (3:53 - 3:56)
there are worse things by this thing (3:53 - 3:58)
when this goes out it's gone (3:56 - 4:01)
yeah yeah the the wulu is gone normally (3:58 - 4:03)
uh so we'll start off with that pokemon (4:01 - 4:04)
news pokemon.com (4:03 - 4:07)
heard wulu and double in max raid (4:04 - 4:08)
battles (4:07 - 4:09)
shiny wulu appearing in sword and shield (4:08 - 4:12)
for a limited time that was may 23rd (4:09 - 4:15)
uh from 5 p.m pdt until (4:12 - 4:17)
they actually don't even have an end (4:15 - 4:19)
date on pokemon.com (4:17 - 4:24)
good uh it ended it ends tonight (4:19 - 4:25)
but by the time this episode comes up it (4:24 - 4:28)
will be over lucky trainers will have a (4:25 - 4:31)
chance to counter shiny (4:28 - 4:31)
wow they really somebody at pokemon.com (4:31 - 4:37)
really they literally said when it (4:34 - 4:38)
started (4:37 - 4:40)
you could encounter shiny wulu and then (4:38 - 4:41)
it said how to connect (4:40 - 4:45)
to the internet to access max raid dens (4:41 - 4:45)
this was (4:45 - 4:48)
probably the shortest (4:45 - 4:50)
raid announcement they have done since (4:48 - 4:52)
they started doing this was this for (4:50 - 4:54)
international wool day (4:52 - 4:56)
was that this weekend i don't know why (4:54 - 4:58)
did they do it this weekend was there a (4:56 - 4:59)
reason (4:58 - 5:01)
was it for eurovision i don't think (4:59 - 5:02)
there was (5:01 - 5:04)
unless there were sheep in eurovision (5:02 - 5:06)
that there's always sheep in eurovision (5:04 - 5:08)
it's eurovision (5:06 - 5:11)
europe is mostly sheep somebody brought (5:08 - 5:12)
people on stage i hope (5:11 - 5:15)
i did not see any sheep i saw a massive (5:12 - 5:16)
12-foot moon (5:15 - 5:19)
and some massive inflatable trumpets (5:16 - 5:22)
but no no sheep covered complications (5:19 - 5:23)
presumably (5:22 - 5:26)
assumed okay there's gotta be an (5:23 - 5:29)
international wool day i'm looking it up (5:26 - 5:33)
uh yeah this it's fine i mean the (5:29 - 5:36)
wooloos came and went and not (5:33 - 5:40)
i stay i i have done every one of these (5:36 - 5:43)
max raid battle weekends uh even though (5:40 - 5:45)
i've always frustrated their last minute (5:43 - 5:46)
and there's usually eight other (5:45 - 5:48)
pokemon events happening the same (5:46 - 5:51)
weekend and i have noticed that this (5:48 - 5:53)
even though it was wulu so it's either (5:51 - 5:54)
two things (5:53 - 5:56)
either and i think it's the latter but (5:54 - 5:57)
either number one (5:56 - 5:59)
maybe just everyone decided to shiny (5:57 - 6:01)
hunt right when the game came out (5:59 - 6:04)
or number two people just don't care (6:01 - 6:05)
anymore (6:04 - 6:08)
and i feel like it's just people are (6:05 - 6:08)
very (6:08 - 6:12)
like over so (6:08 - 6:15)
i will say that most of the (6:12 - 6:17)
people that i watched that are shiny (6:15 - 6:19)
hunters when sword shield first came out (6:17 - 6:20)
were all (6:19 - 6:22)
shiny hunting bulu because it was the (6:20 - 6:25)
black sheep thing (6:22 - 6:28)
so i don't know that also it came (6:25 - 6:30)
literally out of the blue (6:28 - 6:34)
like all of these dudes all of them do (6:30 - 6:34)
but it's like (6:34 - 6:39)
but it's like oh lulu i mean i guess (6:34 - 6:41)
i i find these funny because it feels (6:39 - 6:43)
like because they're so sudden (6:41 - 6:44)
it feels like what they've done is (6:43 - 6:47)
somebody's gone oh we need an event this (6:44 - 6:48)
month (6:47 - 6:49)
we've not done one look it's the last (6:48 - 6:51)
second last weekend in the month who's (6:49 - 6:52)
going to do it right let's just (6:51 - 6:54)
press it live choose a random number (6:52 - 6:57)
right let's let's do it (6:54 - 6:57)
do you participate in these at all al do (6:58 - 7:01)
you get ready (7:00 - 7:04)
for these events i do i've not got them (7:01 - 7:05)
every single time because i can't be (7:04 - 7:07)
bothered (7:05 - 7:08)
i certainly can't avoid finding shiny (7:07 - 7:10)
myself um (7:08 - 7:11)
and what i tend to find is that if (7:10 - 7:13)
you're doing random online ones (7:11 - 7:15)
apart from the absolutely dreadful way (7:13 - 7:16)
to try and actually get the (7:15 - 7:19)
list updated so you can join them i find (7:16 - 7:20)
that either it's just a whole bunch of (7:19 - 7:21)
people putting up the (7:20 - 7:23)
one to four star ones which let's be (7:21 - 7:26)
honest nobody cares about it (7:23 - 7:28)
or you fi you finally find a five star (7:26 - 7:29)
one and of course it's full because (7:28 - 7:30)
there's only (7:29 - 7:32)
four spaces and in fact three spaces (7:30 - 7:34)
because one's taken up by the host (7:32 - 7:36)
yeah so i find that a relatively (7:34 - 7:38)
frustrating experience so (7:36 - 7:40)
it's good when somebody for example in (7:38 - 7:41)
the slack uh (7:40 - 7:43)
finds one and then lets people jump on (7:41 - 7:44)
yeah that way (7:43 - 7:47)
i i have a wonderful angel that finds (7:44 - 7:48)
them and (7:47 - 7:50)
when they find one sends me messages (7:48 - 7:52)
like hey do you want to get on this and (7:50 - 7:52)
i'm like yes (7:52 - 7:56)
uh fyi a wool awareness week (7:52 - 8:00)
is september 28th to october 6th okay (7:56 - 8:03)
not not in may no but (8:00 - 8:07)
april 9th was the first european wool (8:03 - 8:09)
day (8:07 - 8:12)
still not me still not mad maybe they (8:09 - 8:15)
had to push it back (8:12 - 8:18)
uh i still with with this (8:15 - 8:20)
like there's always somebody who comes (8:18 - 8:22)
in or somebody in the slack that will (8:20 - 8:24)
find a shiny and then they'll let people (8:22 - 8:24)
join (8:24 - 8:26)
and then they'll they'll not they'll (8:24 - 8:28)
like restart their switch so they can (8:26 - 8:29)
host it again (8:28 - 8:31)
and whatever if that's what you're cool (8:29 - 8:33)
with if you like being the person that (8:31 - 8:34)
hosts to make people's days (8:33 - 8:37)
i get it and then if you're the person (8:34 - 8:39)
that's like look i just don't have (8:37 - 8:42)
six hours this weekend to try uh (8:39 - 8:43)
and i'm just gonna join one of my (8:42 - 8:46)
friends who did this for me i get it (8:43 - 8:48)
i still like the discovery of trying to (8:46 - 8:50)
find it myself (8:48 - 8:53)
steve we don't all have a billion (8:50 - 8:54)
don't enjoy wishing pieces last time i (8:53 - 8:56)
checked you're like i'm just gonna go (8:54 - 8:58)
around once (8:56 - 9:00)
and if i don't find it i'm out and then (8:58 - 9:01)
you went (9:00 - 9:03)
back right when i found one and then you (9:01 - 9:06)
got all mad at me because i had a shiny (9:03 - 9:08)
meowth and you're like why didn't you (9:06 - 9:09)
let me know (9:08 - 9:11)
well you you didn't even care you didn't (9:09 - 9:14)
care long enough to stay in the game (9:11 - 9:15)
well i that was because pokemon snap (9:14 - 9:17)
came out that weekend and i did zootopia (9:15 - 9:18)
came out on (9:17 - 9:21)
friday and i think we've got a wulu hold (9:18 - 9:23)
on side side note i don't think i would (9:21 - 9:24)
like metopia (9:23 - 9:28)
why i don't know it's cute (9:24 - 9:31)
yeah okay funny uh going back your (9:28 - 9:33)
friends can join you on adventures (9:31 - 9:37)
i was not frustrated at the like concept (9:33 - 9:40)
of like i love meowth so (9:37 - 9:42)
when gallery and meowth was featured as (9:40 - 9:43)
a shiny i would that was like (9:42 - 9:46)
oh that i would have probably wanted to (9:43 - 9:48)
try to get like six of them (9:46 - 9:51)
but they did it on the launch weekend (9:48 - 9:53)
of pokemon snap not even like give (9:51 - 9:55)
pokemon snap a week to breathe (9:53 - 9:57)
and then like it was either there was a (9:55 - 9:58)
go event that weekend as well wasn't (9:57 - 10:02)
yeah yeah so that was the frustrating (9:58 - 10:02)
part (10:02 - 10:06)
because and i literally just threw a (10:02 - 10:07)
master ball at it i was like i don't (10:06 - 10:08)
want (10:07 - 10:10)
i want them shining me out and then i'm (10:08 - 10:11)
moving on you (10:10 - 10:15)
you used a master ball yeah (10:11 - 10:18)
what like shining me out that much i (10:15 - 10:18)
feel betrayed (10:18 - 10:22)
giovanni would be very proud of me no no (10:18 - 10:24)
giovanni never had a master ball in his (10:22 - 10:26)
life giovanni does it the old way (10:24 - 10:30)
extortion well it depends which giovanni (10:26 - 10:34)
we're talking about (10:30 - 10:37)
almost he did he did i think pick up the (10:34 - 10:38)
master ball and you have to get off him (10:37 - 10:39)
so (10:38 - 10:41)
yeah this will be bad bad podcast but (10:39 - 10:42)
good for video (10:41 - 10:46)
i i got this oh yay (10:42 - 10:50)
pokemon adventures uh three (10:46 - 10:53)
it is the complete sorry collector's (10:50 - 10:54)
edition but it's all (10:53 - 10:56)
it's thick it's all the little books (10:54 - 10:58)
that they merge into one (10:56 - 10:59)
yeah i have all the little books (10:58 - 11:00)
individually because i really like that (10:59 - 11:01)
yellow series (11:00 - 11:03)
and so i i was i went to chicago (11:01 - 11:05)
yesterday and they have a bookstore (11:03 - 11:07)
attached to mitsuwo which is a japanese (11:05 - 11:09)
marketplace and they had (11:07 - 11:11)
two they had two through eight they were (11:09 - 11:12)
missing one (11:11 - 11:16)
um and there's there's a dodrio with a (11:12 - 11:18)
with a saddle on the back here and then (11:16 - 11:20)
there's a fat pikachu which is (11:18 - 11:22)
ultimately what caused me to buy it yes (11:20 - 11:25)
that saddle looks attached to its beak (11:22 - 11:26)
yeah whether that's (11:25 - 11:28)
the rain (11:26 - 11:31)
[Applause] (11:28 - 11:31)
the thing that spectator and glass deer (11:32 - 11:35)
have the (11:34 - 11:39)
yeah they are the reigns (11:35 - 11:44)
not lasso very different thing (11:39 - 11:46)
um so i was like i looked them up on (11:44 - 11:47)
amazon (11:46 - 11:48)
and they were like two dollars cheaper (11:47 - 11:50)
and i was like okay well you know (11:48 - 11:51)
instant said (11:50 - 11:53)
gratification i'm right here i'll get (11:51 - 11:54)
something because i never get anything (11:53 - 11:56)
from that bookstore but i feel like (11:54 - 11:58)
i feel bad that i'm the person that (11:56 - 12:00)
always walks around this bookstore every (11:58 - 12:01)
time i go to mitzvah and then i don't (12:00 - 12:02)
get anything (12:01 - 12:04)
why because i feel like i feel like if (12:02 - 12:06)
any kind of store (12:04 - 12:10)
needs business it's a bookstore (12:06 - 12:12)
now did you get the english translation (12:10 - 12:13)
or is it japanese inside no (12:12 - 12:15)
so they have a whole english wall and (12:13 - 12:18)
then their isles are like the (12:15 - 12:19)
jed they have like the japanese aisle (12:18 - 12:21)
and then like the adult isle and the (12:19 - 12:23)
other japanese and the japanese and then (12:21 - 12:25)
the adult and the japanese (12:23 - 12:27)
but those those are like but the whole (12:25 - 12:29)
english wall is (12:27 - 12:32)
the english wall so they do have they (12:29 - 12:33)
did have like (12:32 - 12:35)
in the japanese aisle if you search for (12:33 - 12:37)
p they did have like the pokemon (12:35 - 12:41)
in japanese specifically uh (12:37 - 12:43)
but when i was going up to buy it the (12:41 - 12:45)
guy was like (12:43 - 12:49)
did you read one and two and i said nope (12:45 - 12:51)
and he goes well you know it's a whole (12:49 - 12:52)
different story (12:51 - 12:54)
and i'm like yup that's why i know i (12:52 - 12:58)
don't have to read one and two (12:54 - 12:58)
it's a good story too (12:59 - 13:02)
but this is this is the uh this is this (13:02 - 13:06)
dude is yellow (13:04 - 13:09)
but not the yellow in the (13:06 - 13:11)
well obviously because he's wearing a (13:09 - 13:13)
cowboy hat (13:11 - 13:15)
you need you need to read you need to (13:13 - 13:17)
read that book (13:15 - 13:20)
what book the squirrel book the yellow (13:17 - 13:21)
because you just made a whole bunch of (13:20 - 13:23)
mistakes (13:21 - 13:24)
look i just bought it honestly you know (13:23 - 13:27)
what's gonna happen it's gonna sit on (13:24 - 13:28)
the shelf for about 20 years (13:27 - 13:29)
i was going to say are you ever going to (13:28 - 13:32)
take it out of the cellophane probably (13:29 - 13:32)
not (13:32 - 13:34)
i bought it because there's a fat (13:32 - 13:37)
pikachu on the back i like how you you (13:34 - 13:39)
uh point out that it's different from (13:37 - 13:40)
you were going to say the yellow in the (13:39 - 13:42)
game there is no yellow in the game the (13:40 - 13:42)
game is (13:42 - 13:45)
is ash that's the the entire point of (13:42 - 13:47)
yellow was that it was meant to be a (13:45 - 13:49)
version that is more closely aligned oh (13:47 - 13:51)
yeah yeah but the default name is like (13:49 - 13:51)
yellow (13:51 - 13:54)
i don't know it's not it's ash no it's (13:51 - 13:55)
not (13:54 - 13:56)
yes it is am i going to have to pull out (13:55 - 13:58)
the game and show you is it look i don't (13:56 - 14:00)
know what scotland version of pokemon (13:58 - 14:02)
yellow you got but i'm pretty sure (14:00 - 14:05)
it's it's like yellow ash dean (14:02 - 14:08)
and like jacob or something there's like (14:05 - 14:09)
foreign (14:08 - 14:12)
the three names what are the three names (14:09 - 14:12)
in red (14:12 - 14:16)
it's like red oh blue (14:12 - 14:18)
this would be on a bar trivia quiz of (14:16 - 14:20)
like what are the three (14:18 - 14:23)
names that you get presented in pokemon (14:20 - 14:23)
red (14:23 - 14:25)
and then because the names in blue are (14:23 - 14:27)
different right it's like blue (14:25 - 14:29)
yeah i don't even think it says gary (14:27 - 14:30)
though it doesn't say gary and ash for (14:29 - 14:31)
red and blue (14:30 - 14:35)
no gary i think it has for the (14:31 - 14:38)
uh the rival it does have gary as my (14:35 - 14:39)
rival (14:38 - 14:42)
because when i started it up (14:39 - 14:45)
i was with my brother whose name is gary (14:42 - 14:47)
and i was like oh funny (14:45 - 14:49)
that's weird because i didn't know (14:47 - 14:50)
anything about pokemon oh because the (14:49 - 14:52)
rival had like three names too (14:50 - 14:55)
yeah yeah but (14:52 - 14:55)
you don't get presented with anything (14:56 - 14:58)
all right it's just question mark (14:57 - 15:00)
question mark do you want do you want (14:58 - 15:01)
the spoiler (15:00 - 15:04)
for pokemon yellow the manga (15:01 - 15:07)
it's the 20 year old manga shirt yeah (15:04 - 15:09)
it's not a dude (15:07 - 15:11)
is this a metroid yeah this is this is a (15:09 - 15:12)
metroid (15:11 - 15:14)
well how is it really not read any of (15:12 - 15:16)
this this manga how far into the book do (15:14 - 15:18)
i have to get (15:16 - 15:21)
uh it's in the first six chapters i (15:18 - 15:22)
think (15:21 - 15:24)
six drafts the first thing how many (15:22 - 15:26)
chapters are there there will be like (15:24 - 15:29)
there's seven chapters there's like (15:26 - 15:30)
there's like eight no i don't remember (15:29 - 15:33)
how many there are in total (15:30 - 15:35)
there is a there is a rom hack of a (15:33 - 15:36)
pokemon game that (15:35 - 15:38)
plays through the manga story line so (15:36 - 15:40)
that might be better for you steve if (15:38 - 15:41)
you don't actually want to read a book (15:40 - 15:45)
nah nah i just i suggested a rum hack of (15:41 - 15:46)
course you're not going to do that (15:45 - 15:48)
no i just want to buy i just like buying (15:46 - 15:49)
pokemon stuff and then letting it do (15:48 - 15:52)
nothing (15:49 - 15:53)
that is my did we get the names of red (15:52 - 15:55)
and blue oh (15:53 - 15:57)
were we supposed to get those you're (15:55 - 15:58)
using the greg you're the one that looks (15:57 - 15:59)
things up (15:58 - 16:01)
look i was looking at how many chapters (15:59 - 16:03)
there are in the yellow adventures (16:01 - 16:06)
i don't remember uh why would i search (16:03 - 16:07)
for that (16:06 - 16:08)
see but the thing why i think i (16:07 - 16:10)
gravitated towards this (16:08 - 16:13)
big book is because it's not like (16:10 - 16:17)
seven little books maybe (16:13 - 16:20)
hmm yeah i think i want (16:17 - 16:23)
i would rather have one universal thing (16:20 - 16:25)
than a bunch of little things (16:23 - 16:28)
but maybe i'm not sure (16:25 - 16:32)
now i'm thinking about how i buy things (16:28 - 16:35)
now it's a little late (16:32 - 16:39)
uh one website says it's yellow (16:35 - 16:43)
ash and jack for jack jack (16:39 - 16:46)
i said jacob dang i was close so yellow (16:43 - 16:49)
yellows before ash yes fine yeah (16:46 - 16:52)
i think is the just the color is the (16:49 - 16:53)
first one (16:52 - 16:54)
yeah well i knew that was the case for (16:53 - 16:55)
red and blue but i didn't think that was (16:54 - 16:58)
the case for yellow (16:55 - 17:00)
well what were they in red weren't we (16:58 - 17:01)
asking about red yeah (17:00 - 17:03)
because i'm pretty sure rhett i was like (17:01 - 17:05)
taken aback when i played blue (17:03 - 17:07)
and like it was like blue and then two (17:05 - 17:09)
names that were not my name and i was (17:07 - 17:10)
like (17:09 - 17:14)
how could they it was like timothy or (17:10 - 17:16)
david or something not timothy i don't (17:14 - 17:17)
think that's you could don't think you (17:16 - 17:19)
could do that many characters but yeah (17:17 - 17:21)
it was it was red and then two other (17:19 - 17:22)
just random (17:21 - 17:25)
names yeah they were pretty generic like (17:22 - 17:27)
yeah boy names (17:25 - 17:30)
sorry to anyone named whatever the (17:27 - 17:31)
readable we are (17:30 - 17:33)
as as greg looks that up i'll i'll queue (17:31 - 17:35)
up the next news here you think (17:33 - 17:38)
bubblepedia would have it they'd (17:35 - 17:39)
probably do under some weird trivia (17:38 - 17:40)
section (17:39 - 17:42)
probably we're getting into the (17:40 - 17:43)
timeframe where it would've been quicker (17:42 - 17:44)
just to build up the game and start a (17:43 - 17:47)
new one but i mean (17:44 - 17:51)
this is on pokemon.com luminous legends (17:47 - 17:51)
y (17:51 - 17:54)
introduces sylveon and evil tall to (17:51 - 17:55)

doesn't say here um (18:22 - 18:25)

but the day in a mind said that it was (18:25 - 18:29)
30 hearts which is (18:26 - 18:31)
pretty easy i think to get if you've (18:29 - 18:32)
done the muddy stuff it's pretty easy to (18:31 - 18:33)
get about 10 day (18:32 - 18:37)

aren't the only pokemon to be in the (19:06 - 19:09)
spotlight of part two (19:07 - 19:11)
uh pokemon appearing more in the wild (19:09 - 19:13)
like ralts spritzy swirlix and several (19:11 - 19:14)
dark type pokemon (19:13 - 19:16)
uh will be that were featured in part (19:14 - 19:18)

the rival and not for the maine did you (19:28 - 19:33)
find maine it was blue (19:31 - 19:35)
gary and john were the rivals but i (19:33 - 19:37)
can't find it for the maine (19:35 - 19:42)
oh internet why are you bad (19:37 - 19:42)
it's kind of crazy how much pokemon (19:43 - 19:46)
information is out there (19:44 - 19:50)
that like cereby doesn't document like (19:46 - 19:51)
cerebri documents a lot of (19:50 - 19:55)
the gameplay stuff but like i saw joe (19:51 - 19:58)
tweet at um pokey jungle we've had (19:55 - 20:01)
poke jungle and joe both on the show uh (19:58 - 20:02)
but like pokey jungle will tweet a lot (20:01 - 20:04)
of japanese merchandise when it's (20:02 - 20:05)
released (20:04 - 20:06)
there's like no merchandise stuff on (20:05 - 20:08)
therapy like yeah (20:06 - 20:12)
which is kind of like there (20:08 - 20:14)
that as somebody who just bought an 18 (20:12 - 20:16)
book that will gather a bunch of dust on (20:14 - 20:17)
the shelf (20:16 - 20:20)
there's a lot of pokemon merchandise and (20:17 - 20:21)
i don't even know where to go to like (20:20 - 20:23)
look up that stuff like there's (20:21 - 20:24)
there's not a website out there that (20:23 - 20:26)
documents that i mean bulbapedia has (20:24 - 20:29)
some merchandise documented (20:26 - 20:31)
uh like i'm sure you can look up the (20:29 - 20:33)
burger king gold cards on (20:31 - 20:36)
bubblepedia and you can look up the i (20:33 - 20:38)
want to say bulbapedia's card database (20:36 - 20:38)
is (20:38 - 20:41)
better than cerebes but i'm sure there's (20:38 - 20:44)
an even better database out there (20:41 - 20:46)
yeah i suspect it's just because there's (20:44 - 20:48)
a ridiculous amount of it right like (20:46 - 20:51)
how how far levels do you go down like (20:48 - 20:53)
even if you just talk about cards that's (20:51 - 20:55)
so many cards and then there's the (20:53 - 20:56)
plushes and there's the (20:55 - 20:58)
the manga there's there's just so many (20:56 - 21:00)
things where do you stop (20:58 - 21:02)
uh according to this youtube let's play (21:00 - 21:05)
that i just started watching (21:02 - 21:08)
it it's red ash and jack so they only (21:05 - 21:09)
changed it to yellow (21:08 - 21:14)
jack jack jack got double dipping (21:09 - 21:16)
jack has been there all along it's been (21:14 - 21:18)
jack the entire time (21:16 - 21:22)
interesting but if if you were (21:18 - 21:26)
ideally to start databasing merch (21:22 - 21:28)
i think databating the history data (21:26 - 21:30)
basing the history of merch would be (21:28 - 21:31)
harder than (21:30 - 21:32)
keeping up with it because there has to (21:31 - 21:36)
be there has to be like (21:32 - 21:37)
at least poker jungle knows when the (21:36 - 21:39)
japanese stuff comes out because he's on (21:37 - 21:40)
top of it every (21:39 - 21:46)
so much merch that would be (21:40 - 21:49)
like you would have to database each (21:46 - 21:50)
tiny figure if you're going for the (21:49 - 21:52)
merch in japan so which means you have (21:50 - 21:53)
to catalog each figure and then when (21:52 - 21:55)
they changed (21:53 - 21:57)
as well as every plush and every sitting (21:55 - 21:58)
cutie as long as every time they've (21:57 - 21:59)
changed those (21:58 - 22:02)
plus you know that there's going to be (21:59 - 22:04)
one (22:02 - 22:06)
every shirt they've ever made every (22:04 - 22:08)
plate every butter dish (22:06 - 22:12)
like that is that is a massive amount of (22:08 - 22:14)
work for nobody who cares (22:12 - 22:17)
yeah i think the issue people do care (22:14 - 22:20)
the main issue i don't the main issue i (22:17 - 22:21)
don't think is actually (22:20 - 22:23)
keeping that up to date is actually (22:21 - 22:24)
making it (22:23 - 22:28)
useful like how how how do you (22:24 - 22:30)
categorize that you know do you just (22:28 - 22:31)
have a massive list and you just have a (22:30 - 22:32)
search in it (22:31 - 22:35)
like it's it's an insane level of (22:32 - 22:37)
detail you'd have to go in for it to be (22:35 - 22:38)
truly useful that's (22:37 - 22:41)
multiple people's full-time jobs yeah i (22:38 - 22:42)
can't even imagine (22:41 - 22:44)
i can barely navigate serbia as it is (22:42 - 22:46)
much less necessarily merchandise (22:44 - 22:47)
database (22:46 - 22:48)
well like i think that's a saturday (22:47 - 22:50)
issue rather than anything else (22:48 - 22:53)
like i have i have a bunch of pokemon (22:50 - 22:54)
merch (22:53 - 22:58)
um that i don't know exactly (22:54 - 23:01)
when it was made so it'd be interesting (22:58 - 23:02)
to like look that up (23:01 - 23:05)
but yeah they have tags on them or (23:02 - 23:07)
this is this like like i have for (23:05 - 23:09)
example i have like two pokemon (23:07 - 23:12)
bandanas that are that were only they (23:09 - 23:13)
only came from japan (23:12 - 23:16)
there was a point in time this was i (23:13 - 23:17)
don't think you could do this anymore (23:16 - 23:18)
but back in like (23:17 - 23:20)
2013 what i would do is i would go to (23:18 - 23:23)
ebay every night and then i would search (23:20 - 23:24)
free shipping (23:23 - 23:27)
and then i would search pokemon center (23:24 - 23:28)
the word pokemon center (23:27 - 23:31)
and then i would sort by ending soon and (23:28 - 23:32)
there would be (23:31 - 23:37)
a bunch of things mislabeled (23:32 - 23:40)
uh that like didn't get any bids (23:37 - 23:42)
but it would be free shipping and then (23:40 - 23:43)
it would only be like four or five (23:42 - 23:45)
dollars and i would order that stuff and (23:43 - 23:46)
it would be stuff (23:45 - 23:47)
from the official pokemon center in (23:46 - 23:49)
japan so you get those like tiny little (23:47 - 23:50)
cups that they have (23:49 - 23:52)
or in the case bandanas and i would only (23:50 - 23:53)
pay (23:52 - 23:55)
just a couple bucks for each of them and (23:53 - 23:56)
they would be free shipping because i (23:55 - 23:57)
would (23:56 - 23:59)
only filter by free shipping and i would (23:57 - 24:01)
i would get a bunch of weird (23:59 - 24:04)
pokemon center trinkets and stuff every (24:01 - 24:06)
couple weeks because it was like your (24:04 - 24:09)
own bizarre loot crate (24:06 - 24:13)
it kind of was why and what did you do (24:09 - 24:14)
with it (24:13 - 24:20)
did you just put it in a box yeah (24:14 - 24:20)
but like like looking behind me (24:23 - 24:29)
like i have i have something like this (24:27 - 24:30)
which (24:29 - 24:32)
it may be in in this is this is the (24:30 - 24:35)
pokemon go (24:32 - 24:38)
go fest uh i guess it has a date on it (24:35 - 24:40)
so i could be like oh it's 2019. but if (24:38 - 24:41)
it didn't have that date (24:40 - 24:43)
in like 15 years people would be like oh (24:41 - 24:45)
where did what pokemon event would is (24:43 - 24:46)
that was that from (24:45 - 24:48)
no i don't think anyone's saying that to (24:46 - 24:48)
you (24:48 - 24:51)
[Laughter] (24:48 - 24:53)
i don't think i'm not suggesting i (24:51 - 24:55)
suspect greg is suggesting this but i'm (24:53 - 24:57)
not suggesting that such a database (24:55 - 24:58)
would not be useful (24:57 - 25:02)
i am i'm saying that the level of detail (24:58 - 25:05)
would be too much and not just that (25:02 - 25:07)
you've got to remember (25:05 - 25:08)
it's not even it's not it's obviously (25:07 - 25:10)
not just america but it's also not just (25:08 - 25:11)
japan (25:10 - 25:13)
there are many different things in (25:11 - 25:15)
different countries that only released (25:13 - 25:16)
in that one country (25:15 - 25:19)
and good luck finding english (25:16 - 25:20)
translations of those (25:19 - 25:24)
to figure out the data for it amazon (25:20 - 25:25)
already struggles with keeping their (25:24 - 25:27)
merchandise in order (25:25 - 25:30)
much less a giant database of all-time (25:27 - 25:33)
pokemon stuff (25:30 - 25:35)
i would i would say though that a merch (25:33 - 25:36)
database (25:35 - 25:38)
wouldn't would be complicated i'm not (25:36 - 25:39)
gonna i don't wanna (25:38 - 25:41)
downplay that it wouldn't be complicated (25:39 - 25:42)
but like documenting an (25:41 - 25:46)
entire game like black 2 white 2 (25:42 - 25:49)
is probably more complicated than saying (25:46 - 25:50)
like this (25:49 - 25:52)
these sitting cutie these 150 sitting (25:50 - 25:54)
cuties came out in (25:52 - 25:56)
july you're taking a very limited number (25:54 - 25:57)
there right (25:56 - 26:00)
like i could i could say the same thing (25:57 - 26:00)
about black too (26:00 - 26:02)
you know it's not not i'll take a long (26:00 - 26:04)
time to just write down all the pokemon (26:02 - 26:05)
names right (26:04 - 26:06)
but that's not all it is there's so much (26:05 - 26:08)
more to it and i guess the (26:06 - 26:12)
with a game there's ignoring dlc there's (26:08 - 26:14)
a limit you know you you know going in (26:12 - 26:15)
once you get to the end that's it that's (26:14 - 26:17)
that's everything (26:15 - 26:19)
and it doesn't just add on to it whereas (26:17 - 26:20)
with merchandising there's (26:19 - 26:23)
always going to be more right pokemon's (26:20 - 26:25)
never finishing let's be honest (26:23 - 26:28)
you know like there's not reason there's (26:25 - 26:30)
not regional variants that i know of of (26:28 - 26:32)
pokemon black too like there isn't a (26:30 - 26:34)
secret chinese version that had (26:32 - 26:35)
different pokemon (26:34 - 26:37)
in it once you categor catalog it for (26:35 - 26:39)
one you've cataloged it (26:37 - 26:43)
for every catalog like 800 moves the (26:39 - 26:44)
abilities (26:43 - 26:47)
the like but which are the same as the (26:44 - 26:47)
previous game (26:47 - 26:50)
yeah they're same as is a copy and paste (26:47 - 26:52)
we've known they've been copying pacing (26:50 - 26:54)
forever and so has joe (26:52 - 26:57)
doesn't can't be a pain at one point you (26:54 - 26:58)
know that joel works with (26:57 - 27:00)
with data miners right he's not typing (26:58 - 27:02)
all of that (27:00 - 27:02)
yeah yeah i mean like date of mind (27:02 - 27:07)
within minutes of of of getting the game (27:09 - 27:14)
i mean i suppose we could technically (27:12 - 27:16)
hack into somebody's (27:14 - 27:19)
you know the pokemon center's internal (27:16 - 27:21)
merchandise database and they don't have (27:19 - 27:23)
one (27:21 - 27:26)
there there's somebody i'm not done with (27:23 - 27:29)
the night before (27:26 - 27:29)
there's no way that even um the pokemon (27:29 - 27:33)
company international has a list of all (27:31 - 27:34)
of this (27:33 - 27:36)
there's no way they do they'll have a (27:34 - 27:38)
list of who they've approved (27:36 - 27:40)
to make specific things but they don't (27:38 - 27:41)
have a list (27:40 - 27:45)
more recently like oh i (27:41 - 27:48)
i started this job in 2018 and i have (27:45 - 27:49)
documented everything that i've (27:48 - 27:51)
published (27:49 - 27:54)
nobody's paid that much money no (27:51 - 27:57)
do you how do you i mean i (27:54 - 27:59)
i work for a thing that sells cell (27:57 - 28:01)
phones and we do not keep (27:59 - 28:03)
ongoing lists of the cell phones that we (28:01 - 28:04)
used to have (28:03 - 28:06)
once they're obsolete they are purged (28:04 - 28:08)
from the system and we do not (28:06 - 28:12)
care anymore that's what we can (28:08 - 28:14)
actually a good point have you ever have (28:12 - 28:16)
you ever tried to find a list of all the (28:14 - 28:17)
phones (28:16 - 28:18)
yeah and there are so there are fewer (28:17 - 28:20)
phones than pokemon (28:18 - 28:23)
their pokemon merchandise i mean (28:20 - 28:25)
nokia keeps track of all of their models (28:23 - 28:27)
up to a point until they're obsolete (28:25 - 28:29)
yeah i'm sure phone companies keep track (28:27 - 28:30)
of their own models (28:29 - 28:32)
but that's significantly they're only (28:30 - 28:35)
releasing what like five years a year (28:32 - 28:37)
and then you dump them you purge you (28:35 - 28:40)
always got a purge (28:37 - 28:41)
hey i'm just saying there's maybe a (28:40 - 28:43)
market out there for a merch database (28:41 - 28:44)
although probably (28:43 - 28:47)
way too much time and not probably worth (28:44 - 28:48)
any of the effort sounds like you found (28:47 - 28:50)
a new project (28:48 - 28:58)
pkmn cast merch databases (28:50 - 29:00)
exactly what steve needs more things to (28:58 - 29:01)
do (29:00 - 29:06)
i mean um (29:01 - 29:08)
this is off pokemon go live we talked (29:06 - 29:09)
about last week just bringing it up (29:08 - 29:10)
again (29:09 - 29:13)
uh sunday june 6 from 11 to 5 local (29:10 - 29:16)
gibbel will be appearing in the wild uh (29:13 - 29:18)
if you evolve (29:16 - 29:20)
gibble into garchomp it will know earth (29:18 - 29:22)
power (29:20 - 29:25)
uh you'll the scam box is back with 1200 (29:22 - 29:26)
coins 50 ultra balls (29:25 - 29:28)
yep for one dollar you get a exclusive (29:26 - 29:29)
research called (29:28 - 29:32)
just a nibble which is a pretty good (29:29 - 29:34)
title actually (29:32 - 29:36)
three times the catch experience and (29:34 - 29:42)
then incense will last for three hours (29:36 - 29:44)
i don't know why it's not in here i did (29:42 - 29:45)
ask (29:44 - 29:47)
niantic for clarification they did say (29:45 - 29:49)
that guard mega garchomp will not be (29:47 - 29:50)
available (29:49 - 29:54)
during this event boo which (29:50 - 29:56)
is a bummer yeah they said it will be (29:54 - 29:57)
available at a later date (29:56 - 30:01)
uh but i guess and i misspoke last week (29:57 - 30:04)
i made an error last week my brain went (30:01 - 30:05)
to mush which is (30:04 - 30:08)
90 of the time i said that when you mega (30:05 - 30:11)
evolve your pokemon you get (30:08 - 30:14)
mega energy back when you catch that's (30:11 - 30:16)
that i that that i messed up you get (30:14 - 30:19)
extra candy when you catch so so when (30:16 - 30:20)
you're not candy (30:19 - 30:23)
so okay so like with mega pidgeot you (30:20 - 30:25)
would get bonus candy for catching (30:23 - 30:26)
flying (30:25 - 30:27)
type pokemon because mega pidgeot is (30:26 - 30:30)
flying so when you were catching suabloo (30:27 - 30:32)
instead of three candy you would get (30:30 - 30:33)
four candy (30:32 - 30:37)
so for gibble because gibbel is (30:33 - 30:40)
dragon ground is gibble dragon ground or (30:37 - 30:40)
is (30:40 - 30:43)
gable just dragon i think it's i think (30:40 - 30:43)
it's (30:43 - 30:47)
ground all the way through um you would (30:43 - 30:48)
want to mega evolve (30:47 - 30:51)
altaria so that instead of three candy (30:48 - 30:52)
for gibbel (30:51 - 30:55)
you would get four it is dragon grain (30:52 - 30:55)
jan (30:55 - 30:57)
i don't think we have a ground mega (30:55 - 31:00)
right now (30:57 - 31:00)
low punting is fighting and normal (31:00 - 31:08)
no no so you your only option is alter (31:04 - 31:10)
altaria oh i guess i've got to do that (31:08 - 31:12)
final raid to get the final candy then (31:10 - 31:15)
yeah i don't think i have enough i don't (31:12 - 31:17)
think i care enough (31:15 - 31:19)
but you want you want to stock up on the (31:17 - 31:21)
gimbal kit why (31:19 - 31:22)
i do you know how many gimbal i catch (31:21 - 31:24)
with pine nut berries i have so many (31:22 - 31:26)
candies at the end of it that i do know (31:24 - 31:26)
but the (31:26 - 31:30)
pineapple plus the enter the gives me (31:26 - 31:32)
more candy that i won't use i sit on (31:30 - 31:34)
tons of candy what am i gonna do with it (31:32 - 31:36)
you you don't power it up do you greg (31:34 - 31:38)
that's i also power them up if i'm gonna (31:36 - 31:39)
use them (31:38 - 31:42)
yeah yeah yeah yeah (31:39 - 31:42)
i mean yeah if i get a three star or (31:43 - 31:47)
close to 100 (31:46 - 31:49)
then i might use it to power up and then (31:47 - 31:51)
i'll make that choice but it's (31:49 - 31:53)
that is pretty rare since all my shiny (31:51 - 31:55)
catches are generally bad (31:53 - 31:58)
they're all generally bad cp with bad (31:55 - 31:59)
stars (31:58 - 32:01)
i mean i will power up a shiny but if i (31:59 - 32:02)
don't have a shiny i'll power up a non (32:01 - 32:03)
shiny it's fine i don't (32:02 - 32:05)
whatever as long as it gets me through a (32:03 - 32:10)
raid or a team go rocket battle (32:05 - 32:12)
uh we would probably minnesota people (32:10 - 32:16)
were probably going back to the art park (32:12 - 32:16)
out again we can actually go outside i (32:16 - 32:20)
have 180 (32:19 - 32:23)
mega energy for altaria uh (32:20 - 32:27)
is altaria still in raids yes (32:23 - 32:30)
okay because i need to do one more then (32:27 - 32:32)
i've done none (32:30 - 32:35)
i need one more as well i did the old uh (32:32 - 32:39)
mega houndoom last night (32:35 - 32:42)
gotta make sure that candy is uh stocked (32:39 - 32:42)
up (32:42 - 32:44)
i don't i don't have it in me to hear (32:42 - 32:47)
this again (32:44 - 32:47)
all right uh so there you go if you want (32:47 - 32:52)
to go all out for gable (32:50 - 32:55)
you'll want to have mega altaria (32:52 - 32:57)
as your it doesn't have to be your buddy (32:55 - 33:00)
you just have to mega evolve it (32:57 - 33:03)
so you can just sit there and rot (33:00 - 33:06)
so you'll probably want to do maybe make (33:03 - 33:08)
sure your authority is ready to go for (33:06 - 33:11)
uh for june 6. i think this is going to (33:08 - 33:13)
be the first one i do all six hours like (33:11 - 33:15)
i'm a little bit excited for gimbal (33:13 - 33:18)
guard of not gardevoir would gyarados (33:15 - 33:21)
because doesn't gyarados turn into no (33:18 - 33:22)
it's dark (33:21 - 33:26)
oh it's dark (33:22 - 33:28)
dragon for some reason it's lance lance (33:26 - 33:30)
messes me up every time because the (33:28 - 33:30)
pokemon (33:30 - 33:33)
masters you could do for us oh charizard (33:30 - 33:34)
charizard (33:33 - 33:35)
yeah you could do charizard you could do (33:34 - 33:37)
ampharos (33:35 - 33:41)
yeah so get so many boxes i think though (33:37 - 33:42)
you would maybe (33:41 - 33:43)
want to do altaria though because (33:42 - 33:45)
technically fairies would still be (33:43 - 33:47)
spawning because of the luminous event (33:45 - 33:53)
so you get the bonus from ferry as well (33:47 - 33:55)
oh i thought it was dark that we're (33:53 - 33:56)
doing luminous events because you get (33:55 - 33:58)
you get bonus candy per your type so (33:56 - 34:00)
since your type is (33:58 - 34:02)
dragon fairy which is mega altaria for (34:00 - 34:03)
every (34:02 - 34:04)
table you catch you get the bonus and (34:03 - 34:06)
then for any fairies you catch before or (34:04 - 34:10)
after the event you get the bonus (34:06 - 34:10)
i didn't realize that mega terrier fairy (34:10 - 34:13)
tape (34:13 - 34:16)
yeah but it was still normal no it's (34:13 - 34:17)
it's fairy dragon but it's (34:16 - 34:21)
still bad (34:17 - 34:23)
it's it's not bad because of its typing (34:21 - 34:25)
competitively in vgc (34:23 - 34:29)
it's bad because of its stats (34:25 - 34:29)
it could be better anyways everything (34:30 - 34:33)
could be better (34:32 - 34:35)
but yes you could do charizard and you (34:33 - 34:36)
could do amphoros i can't believe i (34:35 - 34:40)
we i completely forgot about it wait (34:36 - 34:41)
and you want to have a merchandise (34:40 - 34:45)
database yeah (34:41 - 34:45)
so i know when those bandanas were (34:46 - 34:50)
produced (34:48 - 34:52)
okay we will be right back and we'll (34:50 - 34:53)
talk we got (34:52 - 34:55)
to talk about the we got to talk about (34:53 - 34:58)
walmart we'll be right back (34:55 - 34:58)

so (36:25 - 36:28)
and we are back from our break (36:29 - 36:34)
do you does does scotland have walmart (36:34 - 36:41)
no scotland have targeted i believe no (36:37 - 36:42)
we don't (36:41 - 36:44)
i think target tried to launch in (36:42 - 36:46)
england and didn't really oh no that was (36:44 - 36:48)
best buy not target (36:46 - 36:52)
uh i i believe until two years ago (36:48 - 36:53)
asda which is one of our supermarkets (36:52 - 36:55)
was owned by walmart but (36:53 - 36:57)
they are no longer they're now owned by (36:55 - 36:59)
a random rich person (36:57 - 37:02)
uh (36:59 - 37:02)
that brand recognition random rich (37:03 - 37:07)
it okay this this article makes me mad (37:07 - 37:15)
okay so bobby from our slack sent in an (37:11 - 37:16)
article last week i (37:15 - 37:18)
opted not to read it uh but now we're (37:16 - 37:20)
reading it this week (37:18 - 37:21)
because there's another article that it (37:20 - 37:24)
pairs with very nicely (37:21 - 37:26)
so this is off the verge.com walmart (37:24 - 37:28)
confirms it is indeed (37:26 - 37:32)
still selling pokemon cards (37:28 - 37:36)
and this was the um (37:32 - 37:38)
this was because last week target pulled (37:36 - 37:40)
pokemon out we'll just you know not (37:38 - 37:41)
everyone listens every episode we'll (37:40 - 37:43)
just read what happened here (37:41 - 37:44)
irene actually didn't know this happened (37:43 - 37:45)
i was talking to irene in the car (37:44 - 37:47)
yesterday when we were driving home (37:45 - 37:48)
and she was like wait target doesn't (37:47 - 37:51)
sell pokemon cards anymore (37:48 - 37:52)
so walmart confirmed on an email to the (37:51 - 37:54)
verge on friday that it is (37:52 - 37:55)
not suspending the sale of poke of (37:54 - 37:57)
trading cards including pokemon cards (37:55 - 37:58)
that target recently (37:57 - 38:00)
took off the shelves there have been (37:58 - 38:02)
reports on social media of people seeing (38:00 - 38:04)
signs at walmart stores indicating that (38:02 - 38:06)
the retailer would no longer be selling (38:04 - 38:08)
the cards but that is not the official (38:06 - 38:10)
policy (38:08 - 38:10)
uh the pokemon company has been rushing (38:12 - 38:15)
to produce more cards there have been (38:14 - 38:18)
fights in parking lots and heists (38:15 - 38:21)
and uh it has gotten to the point where (38:18 - 38:23)
target has called it quits posting signs (38:21 - 38:24)
informing customers that pokemon (38:23 - 38:29)
mlb nfl and nba cards the ones (38:24 - 38:32)
the ones that are important (38:29 - 38:35)
cards like let's let's be real it's just (38:32 - 38:36)
baseball (38:35 - 38:38)
um no i think there are a couple (38:36 - 38:40)
basketball cards that are doing (38:38 - 38:42)
well uh in a statement to the verge (38:40 - 38:43)
target has (38:42 - 38:45)
temporarily suspended uh was done (38:43 - 38:46)
because of (38:45 - 38:50)
an abundance abundance of caution (38:46 - 38:54)
for its safety and for its customers (38:50 - 38:56)
walmart did say in fact that they have (38:54 - 38:58)
seen an increased demand for cards and (38:56 - 38:59)
that it was (38:58 - 39:01)
determining what if any changes needed (38:59 - 39:02)
to be met (39:01 - 39:04)
while still keeping everyone safe so far (39:02 - 39:05)
it is unclear (39:04 - 39:09)
if the situation will change for walmart (39:05 - 39:12)
well this week has proved differently (39:09 - 39:16)
well record scratch to this week (39:12 - 39:19)
uh i hate this article because (39:16 - 39:22)
yeah and all of these articles because (39:19 - 39:23)
if you do the command (39:22 - 39:25)
f or i don't know what it is on windows (39:23 - 39:26)
the (39:25 - 39:30)
controller and you type in sports (39:26 - 39:33)
or mlb or baseball nothing comes up (39:30 - 39:35)
because they just assume that it's all (39:33 - 39:37)
pokemon cards which is not (39:35 - 39:40)
and if you watch this video uh it's not (39:37 - 39:41)
pokemon card (39:40 - 39:43)
it's not pokemon cards i i mean there (39:41 - 39:44)
are pokemon cards (39:43 - 39:47)
somewhere in there but yeah all of these (39:44 - 39:48)
men (39:47 - 39:51)
all of these grown baseball hat wearing (39:48 - 39:54)
men (39:51 - 39:54)
baseball hat wearing men (39:54 - 40:00)
are going insane in the walmart (39:57 - 40:03)
okay so this is off kotaku this was sent (40:00 - 40:04)
in by (40:03 - 40:08)
alex uh thank you alex chaos at walmart (40:04 - 40:10)
as people rush to buy pokemon (40:08 - 40:13)
cards again there's not any pokemon (40:10 - 40:15)
cards that i see in this video but (40:13 - 40:17)
it's all part of the problem and the (40:15 - 40:18)
narrative that people are doing because (40:17 - 40:21)
the pokemon card thing is gets more (40:18 - 40:23)
clicks than saying baseball cards i (40:21 - 40:23)
guess (40:23 - 40:26)
yeah the continued charters of pokemon (40:23 - 40:27)
cards (40:26 - 40:28)
again nowhere in this article do they (40:27 - 40:30)
bring up sports cards (40:28 - 40:32)
fueled by the pandemic twitch streams (40:30 - 40:34)
and scalpers have led to a chaotic (40:32 - 40:37)
situation at walmart in pennsylvania the (40:34 - 40:39)
moment the stores open folks began to (40:37 - 40:41)
run to the section of the store where (40:39 - 40:42)
trading cards are sold (40:41 - 40:44)
leading to chaos and one sad night uh (40:42 - 40:45)
this video (40:44 - 40:47)
captured by instagram user and shared by (40:45 - 40:49)
a twitter user around a dozen or more (40:47 - 40:50)
people that can be seen (40:49 - 40:53)
rushing to the entrance of walmart the (40:50 - 40:55)
moment the doors were unlocked at 7am (40:53 - 40:57)
but they were there to buy up the newly (40:55 - 40:59)
stocked pokemon carts again (40:57 - 41:02)
and sports cars sports cards i actually (40:59 - 41:03)
still (41:02 - 41:06)
don't there might be pokemon cards in (41:03 - 41:07)
here i didn't see any and (41:06 - 41:10)
the video is i watched the video i mean (41:07 - 41:12)
it's 34 seconds long so (41:10 - 41:13)
you're like you don't see the whole (41:12 - 41:16)
instance but the one thing you do see (41:13 - 41:18)
so to describe this video to an audio (41:16 - 41:19)
podcast you see (41:18 - 41:22)
you do see somebody filming obviously (41:19 - 41:23)
from the back (41:22 - 41:25)
and then in front of them is probably (41:23 - 41:28)
like maybe about eight to ten people (41:25 - 41:29)
and then two of the people have carts (41:28 - 41:32)
yeah and when they turn the corner (41:29 - 41:35)
to where this the cards are there's a (41:32 - 41:35)
guy (41:35 - 41:38)
who is this is the main thing you see (41:35 - 41:39)
his cart is (41:38 - 41:42)
already full of sports cards yep there's (41:39 - 41:44)
not a single pokemon card in his cart (41:42 - 41:46)
and he continues to (41:44 - 41:48)
put more things in his cart all sports (41:46 - 41:49)
related (41:48 - 41:51)
i don't know what sports i'm assuming (41:49 - 41:52)
baseball (41:51 - 41:54)
um well any of them like baseball (41:52 - 41:56)
basketball and (41:54 - 41:58)
football all have their own cards and (41:56 - 41:59)
there are like (41:58 - 42:02)
two guys out of like the 10 that (41:59 - 42:05)
like are debating whether they want to (42:02 - 42:06)
like (42:05 - 42:08)
grab anything that's like the thing that (42:06 - 42:10)
stood out to me like these two guys that (42:08 - 42:12)
are like (42:10 - 42:12)
that's like me in a situation where i'm (42:13 - 42:16)
just like (42:15 - 42:18)
it's all gone it's there's no point this (42:16 - 42:20)
is why your child would never have (42:18 - 42:23)
gotten a cabbage patch kid (42:20 - 42:23)
i do find this this video odd right (42:24 - 42:28)
because now i'm not i'm not going to (42:26 - 42:30)
justify this and say these people are (42:28 - 42:32)
fine right (42:30 - 42:34)
they're not fine because because i do (42:32 - 42:36)
think this (42:34 - 42:39)
just like imagine spending your life (42:36 - 42:39)
like that (42:39 - 42:44)
but other than other than the fact that (42:39 - 42:47)
this is obviously a pandemic and maybe (42:44 - 42:48)
don't get that close to people (42:47 - 42:51)
i don't actually see anything actively (42:48 - 42:52)
wrong (42:51 - 42:53)
there like there's no there's no (42:52 - 42:55)
fighting there's no threatening (42:53 - 42:58)
there's no grabbing from other people's (42:55 - 43:01)
arms or carts like it's just it's a (42:58 - 43:02)
little bit immature (43:01 - 43:05)
but like it's not like that one that (43:02 - 43:06)
that was (43:05 - 43:08)
a couple of weeks ago with the gun being (43:06 - 43:09)
drawn there's nothing (43:08 - 43:11)
really happening yeah i mean this is not (43:09 - 43:13)
as bad as (43:11 - 43:17)
uh a black friday stampede (43:13 - 43:20)
right there's nobody like in the video (43:17 - 43:20)
granted (43:20 - 43:22)
the video is only 34 seconds that i can (43:20 - 43:24)
see so there could have been grabbing (43:22 - 43:25)
and (43:24 - 43:27)
hustling after but in this they are just (43:25 - 43:29)
scooping up what they can and each one (43:27 - 43:32)
like is stuck with the section that they (43:29 - 43:33)
have (43:32 - 43:34)
and the one guy sort of reaching in and (43:33 - 43:37)
just scooping into his cart (43:34 - 43:42)
at a good old sweeping bases i (43:37 - 43:43)
yeah this reminded me a lot of black (43:42 - 43:45)
friday um (43:43 - 43:48)
but what i don't understand is like (43:45 - 43:51)
walmart literally released a press (43:48 - 43:52)
release we just read it (43:51 - 43:55)
yeah like we know that the tcg situation (43:52 - 43:56)
is bad (43:55 - 43:59)
and this walmart of course there's (43:56 - 44:00)
thousands of walmarts (43:59 - 44:02)
they all have different managers (44:00 - 44:04)
different rules different employees (44:02 - 44:06)
maybe this walmart was short on (44:04 - 44:09)
employees when they opened the doors (44:06 - 44:12)
they know this is an issue and i don't (44:09 - 44:14)
understand how (44:12 - 44:17)
with all the black fridays that america (44:14 - 44:18)
has suffered (44:17 - 44:22)
um how like how is there not (44:18 - 44:26)
form a line stay in that line (44:22 - 44:28)
and then we have a limit here and the (44:26 - 44:29)
limit is two or three (44:28 - 44:32)
or four and then you go down the aisle (44:29 - 44:33)
you grab your five (44:32 - 44:35)
go to register you go down the aisle you (44:33 - 44:37)
like how is this not a just process that (44:35 - 44:39)
we just have (44:37 - 44:41)
especially just now because i don't know (44:39 - 44:43)
if it's the same over in america but (44:41 - 44:46)
like we have quite strict limits as to (44:43 - 44:47)
how many people are allowed in (44:46 - 44:51)
stores just now anyway and so like (44:47 - 44:53)
i don't know maybe i'm just living up a (44:51 - 44:55)
lighter place i don't know (44:53 - 44:57)
like yes you're probably well in fact in (44:55 - 44:58)
fact most of our snow (44:57 - 45:00)
our supermarket supermarkets now (44:58 - 45:02)
actually have traffic lights on the door (45:00 - 45:04)
it's a bit weird but like you know and (45:02 - 45:05)
they stop it when there's too many (45:04 - 45:06)
people in (45:05 - 45:08)
so you could absolutely do like we we've (45:06 - 45:09)
already got things that we're dealing (45:08 - 45:12)
with right now for a different situation (45:09 - 45:14)
yeah i mean so i will say this if that (45:12 - 45:15)
store opening (45:14 - 45:18)
there are 10 people like walmarts are (45:15 - 45:18)
huge (45:18 - 45:21)
even at even at (45:18 - 45:23)
best right now which you know before (45:21 - 45:25)
things change it was 25 (45:23 - 45:28)
capacity well a walmart can hold (45:25 - 45:31)
a thousand people so you're not going to (45:28 - 45:32)
be like (45:31 - 45:34)
these 10 people are over capacity like (45:32 - 45:36)
they're right there (45:34 - 45:39)
at store open now (45:36 - 45:41)
it could be that they didn't expect them (45:39 - 45:43)
to be there and they didn't have the (45:41 - 45:45)
the greeters up front and but it looks (45:43 - 45:47)
like they also went around a way that (45:45 - 45:48)
didn't (45:47 - 45:51)
sort of present the standard uh (45:48 - 45:53)
gates that you have to go through to get (45:51 - 45:55)
into a walmart like it seems like (45:53 - 45:57)
a slightly unusual walmart situation (45:55 - 46:02)
that these all knew about it but (45:57 - 46:02)
who knows who knows what happened on (46:02 - 46:06)
this particular i mean i remember (46:04 - 46:08)
during black fridays and this was (46:06 - 46:10)
probably ten years ago now (46:08 - 46:13)
if not more that best buy would (46:10 - 46:16)
hand out numbers to people and like (46:13 - 46:18)
there was there was no way around it (46:16 - 46:19)
even if you wanted even when the doors (46:18 - 46:21)
open and you rushed they (46:19 - 46:23)
would serve the like a deli they would (46:21 - 46:25)
serve the numbers in the order you're (46:23 - 46:27)
hey we're serving number five (46:25 - 46:29)
yeah like why did you why did number (46:27 - 46:31)
five rush past numbers one through four (46:29 - 46:35)
you're number five um i remember when (46:31 - 46:38)
the wii u came out (46:35 - 46:43)
i was so long ago the lz (46:38 - 46:43)
the story is going to come full circle (46:44 - 46:48)
when the wii u came out i went to that (46:46 - 46:50)
target that the gun was pulled out of (46:48 - 46:51)
last year (46:50 - 46:53)
that was the target i went to i went to (46:51 - 46:55)
that target (46:53 - 46:58)
at 4 00 a.m and i (46:55 - 47:00)
parked in the parking lot no one else (46:58 - 47:01)
was there (47:00 - 47:04)
and then the target opened at seven (47:01 - 47:07)
if i remember correctly and the first (47:04 - 47:08)
other car to pull up was at (47:07 - 47:12)
six and they gave me the look (47:08 - 47:15)
and i gave them the look (47:12 - 47:18)
the look was we're both gonna sit in our (47:15 - 47:19)
car together because it's too cold (47:18 - 47:21)
outside yeah oh yeah yeah (47:19 - 47:25)
and then a third car pulled up (47:21 - 47:27)
at like 20 minutes before store opened (47:25 - 47:29)
and they got out and they stood in line (47:27 - 47:31)
so me and the other guy we looked at (47:29 - 47:33)
each other and (47:31 - 47:36)
he like there was no debate he was like (47:33 - 47:37)
you were here before me so you're gonna (47:36 - 47:38)
be second in line (47:37 - 47:40)
and i was like cool i'm cool with being (47:38 - 47:41)
second i don't need to be first i know (47:40 - 47:42)
they have more than (47:41 - 47:46)
one wii u big assumption but (47:42 - 47:50)
um so the other guy get he's already (47:46 - 47:51)
standing (47:50 - 47:53)
i'm in second third and then in the next (47:51 - 47:55)
20 minutes we get a line of maybe like (47:53 - 47:56)
20 people (47:55 - 47:59)
and the target employee opens the door (47:56 - 48:00)
and says (47:59 - 48:02)
okay all that we use are in electronics (48:00 - 48:05)
we're gonna walk you back there (48:02 - 48:08)
like stay in line and there was still (48:05 - 48:09)
there was like still (48:08 - 48:12)
this like has like people still just (48:09 - 48:14)
push past other people (48:12 - 48:16)
like even though the line formed on the (48:14 - 48:17)
outside (48:16 - 48:19)
there was still like this weird rush and (48:17 - 48:22)
it's so frustrating that like (48:19 - 48:25)
grown adults can't operate (48:22 - 48:28)
like school kids and just hey you were (48:25 - 48:29)
sixth (48:28 - 48:31)
in line here why are you pushing to (48:29 - 48:32)
number one like (48:31 - 48:36)
so two people in line if there weren't (48:32 - 48:36)
adults around (48:36 - 48:39)
school kids would behave the exact same (48:36 - 48:40)
way (48:39 - 48:41)
if you've ever had to deal with a number (48:40 - 48:44)
of school kids and you're the only adult (48:41 - 48:45)
and they don't care about you they do (48:44 - 48:48)
the same thing adults don't listen to (48:45 - 48:49)
other adults (48:48 - 48:51)
if there's something that they want like (48:49 - 48:53)
we haven't changed that much (48:51 - 48:56)
yes like oh out of all of these releases (48:53 - 48:59)
whether it's pokemon or tvs or (48:56 - 49:02)
consoles like how have we not (48:59 - 49:05)
as a society figured out the line so (49:02 - 49:09)
we have like the line in america (49:05 - 49:12)
is very sacred like you can ask other (49:09 - 49:14)
countries and they are (49:12 - 49:16)
weirded out about how we strictly are (49:14 - 49:18)
about our lines (49:16 - 49:21)
the thing is is that the companies (49:18 - 49:25)
want the free footage of (49:21 - 49:26)
both here's a product that people want (49:25 - 49:28)
and there's a super demand for it to (49:26 - 49:29)
make people (49:28 - 49:32)
think oh i want to go get this and they (49:29 - 49:32)
also (49:32 - 49:36)
want just the free (49:32 - 49:39)
mention of their store like (49:36 - 49:41)
there really isn't bad publicity here (49:39 - 49:42)
because everybody's going to look at (49:41 - 49:45)
those people and say well (49:42 - 49:48)
they are misbehaving people who are (49:45 - 49:50)
treating this poor store (49:48 - 49:52)
poorly there's very little in the (49:50 - 49:53)
stories that (49:52 - 49:56)
hurt the store so they have very little (49:53 - 49:58)
especially on things like black fridays (49:56 - 50:00)
where they're trying to build (49:58 - 50:03)
up hype for retail for the next month (50:00 - 50:04)
and a half (50:03 - 50:07)
that they like having footage of people (50:04 - 50:08)
rushing into the stores and saying they (50:07 - 50:10)
want these great deals (50:08 - 50:13)
they want those things to happen i i (50:10 - 50:15)
and i totally get that these people are (50:13 - 50:18)
not get are not getting paid enough (50:15 - 50:21)
but also like i have seen it where (50:18 - 50:24)
target employees getting paid like 8.75 (50:21 - 50:25)
which is what target (50:24 - 50:27)
employees get paid in wisconsin which is (50:25 - 50:28)
not the (50:27 - 50:32)
correct wage not is not enough but (50:28 - 50:34)
there is an authority that they have (50:32 - 50:35)
where they s (50:34 - 50:38)
they can say get it in a line stay in a (50:35 - 50:39)
line (50:38 - 50:42)
and people will listen but then there (50:39 - 50:44)
are (50:42 - 50:44)
at least at least i've been in (50:45 - 50:49)
situations where that works (50:46 - 50:52)
it's it is a it is a hit or miss (50:49 - 50:56)
process and we are so i'm gonna (50:52 - 51:00)
say after a year of trying to tell (50:56 - 51:02)
people to comply with (51:00 - 51:05)
mask requirements i do not blame these (51:02 - 51:07)
employees for being like i'm done i'm (51:05 - 51:08)
not even doing this (51:07 - 51:12)
anymore i'm done they don't listen to me (51:08 - 51:12)
about this (51:12 - 51:16)
i don't care about this thing just do it (51:12 - 51:16)
i'm (51:16 - 51:18)
you're paying me yeah i am sure that's a (51:16 - 51:20)
lot barely living wage (51:18 - 51:22)
go at it i don't like it i'm not (51:20 - 51:24)
stocking up i'm not stocking the shelves (51:22 - 51:24)
i'm (51:24 - 51:26)
i don't even want to have to tell you (51:24 - 51:27)
that you some of you aren't wearing (51:26 - 51:31)
masks when you should be (51:27 - 51:33)
we're done like i i think it would be (51:31 - 51:34)
different (51:33 - 51:35)
it would all be different if we didn't (51:34 - 51:37)
have this last year and a half (51:35 - 51:42)
of just pure chaos built into the system (51:37 - 51:45)
of overworked and tired employees and (51:42 - 51:48)
bizarre demand for product (51:45 - 51:51)
it might be like store related too (51:48 - 51:53)
like the seeing this in a walmart being (51:51 - 51:55)
like yep that (51:53 - 51:57)
that seems like walmart customers and (51:55 - 51:58)
then like i feel like people were (51:57 - 51:59)
shocked (51:58 - 52:01)
last week that it was like target it was (51:59 - 52:02)
like oh (52:01 - 52:05)
target that these are target cut like (52:02 - 52:07)
when i went to mitzvah yesterday (52:05 - 52:09)
it was you had to wait in line to get (52:07 - 52:10)
into the store because they were (52:09 - 52:11)
limiting (52:10 - 52:13)
people which is which does not happen at (52:11 - 52:15)
a target or walmart anymore you just (52:13 - 52:16)
walk on in (52:15 - 52:20)
um and they uh (52:16 - 52:22)
you still had to have your mask and (52:20 - 52:24)
everyone had masks everyone waited in (52:22 - 52:24)
the store (52:24 - 52:26)
like there was no commotion the store (52:24 - 52:28)
was relatively empty (52:26 - 52:31)
because they were saying like we only (52:28 - 52:34)
want this many people in (52:31 - 52:36)
but there was like no bad behavior there (52:34 - 52:38)
was no like (52:36 - 52:40)
but you don't get that at like a walmart (52:38 - 52:43)
a walmart is like it's a free-for-all (52:40 - 52:45)
i mean i think it's the they have a (52:43 - 52:48)
built-in (52:45 - 52:48)
they have a built like every store has a (52:48 - 52:52)
built-in reputation about how far (52:50 - 52:55)
you will push it and you know there are (52:52 - 52:56)
definitely targets (52:55 - 53:00)
that people view very differently than (52:56 - 53:02)
other targets like behavior changes (53:00 - 53:03)
being (53:02 - 53:05)
depending on what people have tolerated (53:03 - 53:06)
at that store (53:05 - 53:10)
and i think right or wrong (53:06 - 53:14)
there is a hierarchy of big box stores (53:10 - 53:17)
about what the store looks like and how (53:14 - 53:18)
appropriate it is to behave in those (53:17 - 53:19)
stores (53:18 - 53:22)
i think the reputation of walmart (53:19 - 53:25)
is not great there are websites devoted (53:22 - 53:26)
to how (53:25 - 53:29)
not great walmart is and people will (53:26 - 53:33)
respect and comply to that store (53:29 - 53:35)
based on how they believe that store (53:33 - 53:36)
should be treated (53:35 - 53:38)
so i mean yeah we all say it's not (53:36 - 53:40)
surprising it's a walmart well (53:38 - 53:41)
it's because we all tend to think (53:40 - 53:43)
walmart's (53:41 - 53:46)
garbagey so of course then and i know (53:43 - 53:48)
they're not i know walmart people aren't (53:46 - 53:49)
paid (53:48 - 53:51)
a ton of money just like target people (53:49 - 53:54)
aren't paid a ton of money (53:51 - 53:57)
but target puts in a lot of effort (53:54 - 54:00)
to represent a quote-unquote higher (53:57 - 54:01)
brand (54:00 - 54:03)
than walmart which is like we are here (54:01 - 54:04)
for discounts (54:03 - 54:10)
and they're very different philosophies (54:04 - 54:12)
have lots of opinions about american (54:10 - 54:13)
shops (54:12 - 54:15)
i bet you do and they're all good (54:13 - 54:17)
because america heck yeah (54:15 - 54:21)
we know how to retail and and the (54:17 - 54:23)
intricacies of each different one (54:21 - 54:25)
obviously (54:23 - 54:28)
i do think it's interesting because like (54:25 - 54:28)
we (54:28 - 54:32)
so i i may have seen this on the slack (54:28 - 54:35)
i talked a little bit about how it's (54:32 - 54:37)
we obviously don't have the sports cards (54:35 - 54:38)
because like all of the sports cards (54:37 - 54:40)
that you guys have in america are sports (54:38 - 54:42)
that we don't care about here (54:40 - 54:45)
right and so they don't really exist we (54:42 - 54:45)
have (54:45 - 54:47)
an equivalent thing but it's not (54:45 - 54:49)
something that's a trading card it's not (54:47 - 54:50)
sold (54:49 - 54:53)
in where trading cards are sold and so (54:50 - 54:55)
there are pokemon cards in every shop (54:53 - 54:56)
that i've been in (54:55 - 54:58)
that sell pokemon cards but the demand (54:56 - 55:00)
is is definitely still there (54:58 - 55:02)
they are they are selling out more uh (55:00 - 55:03)
well (55:02 - 55:06)
according to all of the uh people i have (55:03 - 55:07)
talked to in the stores the workers (55:06 - 55:08)
there (55:07 - 55:11)
that could be just based on this (55:08 - 55:13)
these sorts of reporting you never know (55:11 - 55:15)
whether they actually mean that (55:13 - 55:16)
they have seen more people buying (55:15 - 55:18)
pokemon cards just now than (55:16 - 55:20)
than not um who actually knows what (55:18 - 55:22)
these things are like but (55:20 - 55:25)
i've certainly not that these (55:22 - 55:27)
i mean obviously it doesn't really make (55:25 - 55:29)
it's not good comparison because the (55:27 - 55:29)
numbers are so (55:29 - 55:33)
massively different but all of these (55:29 - 55:34)
all of the reporting is coming out of (55:33 - 55:36)
america about these (55:34 - 55:39)
sorts of events (55:36 - 55:42)
i would like to point out al that we do (55:39 - 55:47)
have soccer trading cards (55:42 - 55:50)
that on this website a box is selling (55:47 - 55:51)
for (55:50 - 55:54)
five hundred dollars (55:51 - 55:54)
of all the great soccer stars and there (55:54 - 55:57)
is even (55:56 - 56:01)
a european a euro soccer trading card (55:57 - 56:02)
box (56:01 - 56:05)
coming soon you could get into this you (56:02 - 56:06)
could be the first (56:05 - 56:11)
to bring trading card mania to europe (56:06 - 56:13)
business opportunity for you well-known (56:11 - 56:14)
fan of (56:13 - 56:17)
football soccer sorry (56:14 - 56:19)
if you must well i know okay so there (56:17 - 56:21)
was a point early (56:19 - 56:25)
or earlier this year where (56:21 - 56:25)
english collectors were frustrated that (56:26 - 56:30)
they couldn't get (56:29 - 56:32)
english cards so they started getting (56:30 - 56:33)
japanese cards (56:32 - 56:35)
which were relatively easy to get but (56:33 - 56:37)
were always sold (56:35 - 56:40)
at an upcharge just because of imports (56:37 - 56:41)
and (56:40 - 56:43)
you know very limited where you can get (56:41 - 56:45)
it so for example if i wanted to get (56:43 - 56:48)
like dream league which ended up being (56:45 - 56:50)
our cosmic eclipse (56:48 - 56:53)
um dream league would have been like 40 (56:50 - 56:56)
give or take usd but you would see that (56:53 - 56:58)
a lot of times on amazon or ebay for (56:56 - 57:00)
50 to 60 and that's with just normal (56:58 - 57:01)
prices (57:00 - 57:05)
but now because so many people (57:01 - 57:08)
had the same i the same thought process (57:05 - 57:09)
of like well if i can't get english (57:08 - 57:11)
cards i'll collect japanese cards yeah (57:09 - 57:14)
it caused the japanese market to go up (57:11 - 57:14)
um (57:14 - 57:16)
so now like that same box of dream (57:14 - 57:19)
league is like 120 usd (57:16 - 57:22)
uh which is like like it and (57:19 - 57:25)
again and i think i said this last week (57:22 - 57:26)
i'll say it this week this is why i'm (57:25 - 57:28)
frustrated with this kotaku article they (57:26 - 57:28)
don't (57:28 - 57:31)
talk about the sports cards being the (57:28 - 57:32)
issue (57:31 - 57:34)
and again if sports cards were gone if (57:32 - 57:36)
they target didn't sell sports cards it (57:34 - 57:37)
would still be (57:36 - 57:40)
slightly harder to find pokemon cards i (57:37 - 57:41)
am not discounting that (57:40 - 57:43)
but these people are putting anything (57:41 - 57:44)
they can in their shelves (57:43 - 57:47)
and if they're getting up at 7 a.m and (57:44 - 57:48)
joe (57:47 - 57:50)
six-pack over here is putting all the (57:48 - 57:52)
baseball cards in his cart (57:50 - 57:53)
they're gonna be like well i know (57:52 - 57:55)
pokemon cards are at least (57:53 - 57:58)
money so i'm gonna put those in my cart (57:55 - 58:00)
yeah and this is what's happening (57:58 - 58:03)
uh that's why it's very easy in my (58:00 - 58:04)
opinion at least in the milwaukee area (58:03 - 58:06)
to find (58:04 - 58:08)
pokemon cards at barnes noble because (58:06 - 58:09)
they don't sell (58:08 - 58:12)
sports cards and so those scalpers (58:09 - 58:14)
resellers are not going there they're (58:12 - 58:15)
going to walmarts and targets and well (58:14 - 58:18)
not targets anymore (58:15 - 58:18)
but anyways it's very frustrating i will (58:20 - 58:23)
say (58:22 - 58:26)
that battle styles has been easier to (58:23 - 58:27)
find (58:26 - 58:30)
as of this whole week you can (58:27 - 58:35)
get i've multiple stores on the internet (58:30 - 58:37)
as of this past week you can get 36 (58:35 - 58:40)
packs of battle styles for 99 (58:37 - 58:42)
which is what it used to be before the (58:40 - 58:44)
pandemic i got vivid voltage for 99. i (58:42 - 58:45)
got (58:44 - 58:47)
cosmic eclipse for 99. i got unbroken (58:45 - 58:49)
bonds for 99. (58:47 - 58:51)
like this is what i normally pay and (58:49 - 58:52)
then (58:51 - 58:54)
because of the pandemic i paid 120 for (58:52 - 58:57)
battle styles before battle styles came (58:54 - 58:57)
out (58:57 - 59:01)
and now i can find battle styles for 99 (58:57 - 59:03)
for 36 packs (59:01 - 59:06)
so it's getting better (59:03 - 59:08)
that to be fair battle styles doesn't (59:06 - 59:10)
have a charizard doesn't have pikachu (59:08 - 59:12)
chilling reigns is coming out in a month (59:10 - 59:14)
doesn't have a charizard doesn't have a (59:12 - 59:16)
pikachu (59:14 - 59:20)
it should be easier to find (59:16 - 59:23)
fads come and go i'm be very curious if (59:20 - 59:25)
the people who are so adamant in getting (59:23 - 59:28)
mick champions path or light darkness (59:25 - 59:29)
ablaze (59:28 - 59:31)
if they're gonna keep doing this because (59:29 - 59:33)
they don't know who an urshifu is they (59:31 - 59:35)
don't know what a calorics is they don't (59:33 - 59:36)
know what a (59:35 - 59:39)
even though chilling rains should have (59:36 - 59:41)
articuno moltre zapdos (59:39 - 59:42)
they're galerian they don't look the (59:41 - 59:44)
same so (59:42 - 59:48)
we'll we'll see when that comes out (59:44 - 59:48)
but this is off bleedingcool.com (59:48 - 59:53)
evolving skies will be coming (59:51 - 59:57)
after chilling rains evolving skies (59:53 - 60:01)
is set to release on august 27th um (59:57 - 60:03)
and the reason i pulled this article is (60:01 - 60:05)
because it talks about what could (60:03 - 60:05)
possibly (60:05 - 60:09)
be in evolving skies based off japanese (60:05 - 60:10)
sets (60:09 - 60:12)
so right now the next set coming out (60:10 - 60:13)
which is (60:12 - 60:15)
very hyped in japan and again i think (60:13 - 60:16)
because (60:15 - 60:18)
so many english people were frustrated (60:16 - 60:20)
that they couldn't get english cards (60:18 - 60:23)
and because of it because it being eevee (60:20 - 60:24)
a lot of people (60:23 - 60:27)
were are importing eevee heroes (60:24 - 60:29)
which is the japanese release set it's (60:27 - 60:30)
evie themed (60:29 - 60:33)
it will feature v v max alternative art (60:30 - 60:36)
of the eeveelutions (60:33 - 60:40)
uh this should be a 40 to 50 box usd (60:36 - 60:43)
um it is going for about 150 usd right (60:40 - 60:44)
now (60:43 - 60:47)
uh which (60:44 - 60:50)
yeah is a lot uh it is uh (60:47 - 60:54)
it is titled evolving skies (60:50 - 60:56)
which is a reference to roaring skies a (60:54 - 60:59)
rayquaza themed set (60:56 - 61:02)
the evolving probably to reference eevee (60:59 - 61:04)
is what bleeding cool is reporting (61:02 - 61:06)
so it is it is very likely that evolving (61:04 - 61:08)
skies will feature pretty much all of (61:06 - 61:09)
the eevee heroes (61:08 - 61:13)
stuff sky street stream (61:09 - 61:16)
is the upcoming rayquaza theme set in (61:13 - 61:18)
japan which will release on july 9th (61:16 - 61:20)
number of cards from this set we will (61:18 - 61:23)
know rayquaza vmax (61:20 - 61:27)
um and they're saying because of sky (61:23 - 61:29)
stream and eevee heroes it's very likely (61:27 - 61:31)
that evolving skies features both of (61:29 - 61:33)
those sets (61:31 - 61:35)
towering perfection which is the sister (61:33 - 61:37)
set to sky stream (61:35 - 61:41)
will focus on doraledon uh (61:37 - 61:41)
which is the towering part they're (61:41 - 61:45)
really going into this name (61:43 - 61:48)
anyways very likely it's very likely (61:45 - 61:49)
that these (61:48 - 61:52)
these are the sets and then matchless (61:49 - 61:52)
fighter (61:52 - 61:56)
silver lance jet black poltergeist is (61:52 - 61:59)
what is making up chilling rain because (61:56 - 61:59)
these (61:59 - 62:01)
japanese sets for those that don't know (61:59 - 62:04)
are normally like 80 to like 110 cards (62:01 - 62:06)
and then an english set is like 280 (62:04 - 62:07)
cards (62:06 - 62:08)
it's it's like three sets normally (62:07 - 62:12)
combined so it's a lot (62:08 - 62:12)
and then in august when evolving skies (62:13 - 62:18)
does come out (62:16 - 62:21)
that will be rotation so we will be (62:18 - 62:23)
getting rid of probably everything sun (62:21 - 62:24)
and moon (62:23 - 62:26)
and it will probably be sword and shield (62:24 - 62:28)
and newer (62:26 - 62:32)
going on and we'll probably learn (62:28 - 62:36)
i'm assuming in august whether actual (62:32 - 62:38)
events are going to come back which i'm (62:36 - 62:39)
going to say (62:38 - 62:42)
probably they're going to try it (62:39 - 62:44)
because they probably want to get worlds (62:42 - 62:48)
done and over with at this point (62:44 - 62:50)
i bet they regret choosing london as as (62:48 - 62:52)
2020 because uh (62:50 - 62:55)
they just they can't not do it in london (62:52 - 62:56)
now so they just keep changing when (62:55 - 62:57)
london's going to be and i bet they're (62:56 - 62:58)
like (62:57 - 63:01)
we just it's always looking forward to (62:58 - 63:04)
doing this one (63:01 - 63:06)
in london it's like we can't just do one (63:04 - 63:08)
in america (63:06 - 63:11)
yeah uh yeah who (63:08 - 63:14)
i i wouldn't be surprised if they don't (63:11 - 63:15)
even do spectators (63:14 - 63:18)
even in 2022 i mean (63:15 - 63:20)
is it haven't they been coming down on (63:18 - 63:22)
spectators for a while now (63:20 - 63:25)
um yeah at a certain point it was (63:22 - 63:30)
um was it first no it was first (63:25 - 63:32)
dc i think because it was like dc and (63:30 - 63:34)
then it was nashville (63:32 - 63:37)
and then was it back to dc so i remember (63:34 - 63:38)
going to nashville and then i remember (63:37 - 63:41)
going to dc but nashville you had to (63:38 - 63:44)
buy a ticket and the ticket was ten (63:41 - 63:46)
dollars or maybe it was 12 (63:44 - 63:49)
but they would give you booster packs so (63:46 - 63:50)
you would get the ticket and then you (63:49 - 63:51)
would get like three booster packs (63:50 - 63:54)
so you were saving like two dollars on (63:51 - 63:55)
booster packs (63:54 - 63:56)
because yeah three booster packs would (63:55 - 63:59)
be technically 12 the ticket was 10. (63:56 - 64:02)
um but and you could order the ticket (63:59 - 64:04)
ahead of time (64:02 - 64:06)
which was i don't know i don't even (64:04 - 64:07)
remember if they had a dedicated site (64:06 - 64:09)
for it or if it was just on pokemon.com (64:07 - 64:10)
but you (64:09 - 64:11)
tickets didn't sell out right away they (64:10 - 64:13)
sold out within like two weeks but you (64:11 - 64:13)
would go (64:13 - 64:15)
you would buy a ticket and then you (64:13 - 64:18)
would show up you would give your name (64:15 - 64:19)
they would hand you your ticket your (64:18 - 64:20)
three booster packs and you would be in (64:19 - 64:23)
but yeah they were limiting spectators (64:20 - 64:27)
through ticketed prices (64:23 - 64:28)
and i started that right before (64:27 - 64:31)
nashville it was the same as dc (64:28 - 64:33)
um and i think dc might have sold out a (64:31 - 64:35)
little bit quicker (64:33 - 64:39)
but it was never like oh my gosh (64:35 - 64:42)
i sold out in the first day there (64:39 - 64:44)
is there is a risk that that might end (64:42 - 64:46)
if they do let's assume that they have (64:44 - 64:47)
spectators right because (64:46 - 64:50)
let me tell you if the only pokemon (64:47 - 64:52)
world championships to happen in europe (64:50 - 64:54)
doesn't allow spectators i'm sorry i'm (64:52 - 64:55)
rioting (64:54 - 64:58)
right uh writing i'll fight (64:55 - 65:00)
actually i need to try and qualify then (64:58 - 65:02)
i guess um (65:00 - 65:05)
the there is a risk in the (65:02 - 65:08)
if they have spectators it does sell out (65:05 - 65:10)
incredibly quickly (65:08 - 65:14)
because with all of the american ones (65:10 - 65:17)
it's not like oh this might be my only (65:14 - 65:18)
chance to go to it (65:17 - 65:21)
that's a realistic possibility and you (65:18 - 65:24)
have a large population center (65:21 - 65:27)
in around london and you know paris is (65:24 - 65:29)
not far away there's a large selection (65:27 - 65:31)
of france that are very close to london (65:29 - 65:32)
you can get to the train from paris to (65:31 - 65:34)
london in about an hour and a half (65:32 - 65:37)
right these things are incredibly close (65:34 - 65:39)
the the number of people will be like (65:37 - 65:40)
this might be my only chance without (65:39 - 65:42)
having to fly to america (65:40 - 65:44)
that it could sell out incredibly (65:42 - 65:47)
quickly yeah (65:44 - 65:47)
well when you put it that way yeah (65:47 - 65:50)
because they'll be like well i don't (65:49 - 65:51)
know when it's ever going to come back (65:50 - 65:54)
right yeah exactly uh (65:51 - 65:57)
even with canada i remember so many (65:54 - 65:58)
americans being like (65:57 - 66:00)
oh okay i have to get a passport and (65:58 - 66:03)
it's like but canada's like right there (66:00 - 66:05)
but it was (66:03 - 66:05)
organizers it was like a nightmare (66:06 - 66:10)
getting just (66:08 - 66:12)
volunteers that were supposed to be (66:10 - 66:13)
judges it was like a nightmare to get (66:12 - 66:16)
them over into canada (66:13 - 66:18)
it's much more common in europe to have (66:16 - 66:19)
a passport i think (66:18 - 66:21)
um (66:19 - 66:21)
yes it absolutely is i mean i know so (66:22 - 66:26)
there's less (66:25 - 66:28)
that allows me to get into canada if so (66:26 - 66:31)
if they don't want an event to sell out (66:28 - 66:33)
you just have it in hawaii because the (66:31 - 66:34)
flight will deter (66:33 - 66:37)
the two are so many people like a flight (66:34 - 66:39)
to hawaii is just (66:37 - 66:41)
i mean i still want to go hawaii though (66:39 - 66:43)
like i'll go (66:41 - 66:45)
i mean yeah yeah if there's a pokemon (66:43 - 66:47)
then i'll go too but (66:45 - 66:49)
hawaii's beautiful for i mean you have (66:47 - 66:50)
to (66:49 - 66:52)
it's a vacation but it's going to be a (66:50 - 66:54)
vacation new year's where i go (66:52 - 66:55)
i mean it's not that it's obviously not (66:54 - 66:57)
their fault it was a worldwide pandemic (66:55 - 66:58)
but right i felt like (66:57 - 67:01)
the pokemon world events were gaining so (66:58 - 67:02)
much momentum (67:01 - 67:05)
in being yeah something that people (67:02 - 67:06)
wanted to go to (67:05 - 67:09)
every year yeah yeah and early on when i (67:06 - 67:11)
went to my first world championship (67:09 - 67:12)
which was in (67:11 - 67:15)
2011 or 2012 um it was when the black (67:12 - 67:16)
and white games (67:15 - 67:20)
came out there was really nothing to do (67:16 - 67:24)
you you like at the time (67:20 - 67:27)
it was in it was in san diego and it was (67:24 - 67:28)
in a hotel (67:27 - 67:31)
very nice hotel and you could (67:28 - 67:33)
participate in the last chance qualifier (67:31 - 67:35)
and at that specific event which was not (67:33 - 67:36)
ticketed (67:35 - 67:38)
that last chance qualifier was so big (67:36 - 67:40)
that there was over a thousand people (67:38 - 67:42)
who signed up for last chance qualifier (67:40 - 67:42)
and (67:42 - 67:46)
over 200 people got first round buys (67:42 - 67:48)
like they just couldn't sit that many (67:46 - 67:49)
people (67:48 - 67:51)
so they were like you 200 people you're (67:49 - 67:52)
already making it to round two because (67:51 - 67:54)
we don't have it we don't have a table (67:52 - 67:54)
for you (67:54 - 67:58)
we have no we have no one to sit down (67:54 - 68:02)
um and at the time their pokemon center (67:58 - 68:03)
was so small (68:02 - 68:06)
that people lined up on thursday night (68:03 - 68:10)
all night at like 8 p.m and they went in (68:06 - 68:13)
and it opened at eight and they limited (68:10 - 68:14)
like two items per (68:13 - 68:18)
person and it sold out by like noon (68:14 - 68:20)
and the pokemon center there was closed (68:18 - 68:22)
the rest of the event (68:20 - 68:25)
there it was you couldn't buy anything (68:22 - 68:26)
and that was all there was there was (68:25 - 68:28)
like side tournaments but it was (68:26 - 68:30)
you could watch the matches you could (68:28 - 68:32)
participate in last chance (68:30 - 68:34)
you could participate inside and that (68:32 - 68:35)
was it there was there was all there was (68:34 - 68:36)
to do (68:35 - 68:38)
it was like oh i came all the way out (68:36 - 68:40)
here for (68:38 - 68:41)
like i couldn't even buy anything and it (68:40 - 68:43)
was like there was there's no pokemon go (68:41 - 68:44)
at the time (68:43 - 68:46)
but when i went to the nashville world (68:44 - 68:48)
tournament you could play let's go (68:46 - 68:50)
pikachu let's go eevee early there were (68:48 - 68:51)
side tournaments they did a better job (68:50 - 68:52)
at presenting (68:51 - 68:56)
pokken and tcg and vgc on stage uh (68:52 - 68:59)
they made pokemon go feel like an event (68:56 - 69:00)
while you were down there (68:59 - 69:02)
there was unknown that spelled out i (69:00 - 69:04)
don't know whatever (69:02 - 69:07)
worlds or something uh you could get a (69:04 - 69:09)
meloda (69:07 - 69:12)
they had a huge pokemon center (69:09 - 69:15)
um they just it just and at dc (69:12 - 69:17)
where where greg that was your first one (69:15 - 69:19)
right greg i've never been to worlds (69:17 - 69:21)
oh yeah you didn't go to that world that (69:19 - 69:23)
was that was well (69:21 - 69:26)
um i was going to go to london (69:23 - 69:28)
at the dc one they did everything that (69:26 - 69:30)
nashville did and they did it they added (69:28 - 69:31)
more stuff to it (69:30 - 69:32)
i mean you could play sword and shield (69:31 - 69:35)
for the first time at the dc one (69:32 - 69:38)
so it really felt like yeah (69:35 - 69:40)
london was gonna be like that that first (69:38 - 69:42)
for people being like well i went to (69:40 - 69:43)
nashville i went to dc (69:42 - 69:45)
i i've never left the country but i'm (69:43 - 69:48)
going to leave the country for pokemon (69:45 - 69:48)
um (69:48 - 69:51)
yeah as a side note i think it's (69:48 - 69:54)
i've just remembered they did was it two (69:51 - 69:55)
years ago roughly (69:54 - 69:57)
they had that pop-up pokemon center in (69:55 - 69:59)
london (69:57 - 70:02)
i bet that was a test to see what the (69:59 - 70:04)
demand was like (70:02 - 70:06)
because they were like we might want to (70:04 - 70:07)
do this in london but (70:06 - 70:09)
is there actually demand for it and it (70:07 - 70:10)
it it (70:09 - 70:12)
sold out it was like dead for most of (70:10 - 70:15)
the was it two weeks or something (70:12 - 70:18)
um ironically i was i was in london (70:15 - 70:20)
the day after it's closed and i never go (70:18 - 70:22)
to london it was very annoying (70:20 - 70:24)
it was so late but anyway not a point (70:22 - 70:26)
not not important (70:24 - 70:28)
so yeah i just i that it just that had (70:26 - 70:30)
raised in my mind i wonder if that was a (70:28 - 70:30)
test (70:30 - 70:32)
for whether they wanted to do worlds in (70:30 - 70:34)
london or not but that london store (70:32 - 70:36)
um they were having problems keeping (70:34 - 70:38)
things in stock too (70:36 - 70:40)
yeah and yeah people were lining up very (70:38 - 70:42)
early for it (70:40 - 70:43)
i don't think they initially had a limit (70:42 - 70:45)
on things but like after two hours they (70:43 - 70:46)
did (70:45 - 70:47)
it was like literally on the same day (70:46 - 70:49)
they were like right so a limit of five (70:47 - 70:51)
items (70:49 - 70:53)
and i want to say they also limited like (70:51 - 70:54)
the time you could spend on the store (70:53 - 70:56)
too or something like that because they (70:54 - 70:57)
were just trying to get so many people (70:56 - 70:59)
through (70:57 - 71:02)
there was always a key just always yeah (70:59 - 71:06)
that had um oh you get the the hats (71:02 - 71:08)
the pikachu with the the europe the (71:06 - 71:10)
london hat i don't know what that hat's (71:08 - 71:11)
called (71:10 - 71:15)
oh the um the beefeater's hat yeah (71:11 - 71:16)
yeah which i think i think those those (71:15 - 71:18)
pikachus were going for a decent amount (71:16 - 71:21)
on ebay at the time too (71:18 - 71:23)
uh which is which is all the only reason (71:21 - 71:24)
to have pokemon merch is to (71:23 - 71:27)
to sell it for more money on on ebay we (71:24 - 71:29)
all know that (71:27 - 71:31)
if you ever decide to sell out steve (71:29 - 71:33)
you'll be rich (71:31 - 71:35)
yeah i mean i've been saving pokemon (71:33 - 71:41)
merch for for months for years (71:35 - 71:43)
how do we know how do you even know (71:41 - 71:45)
without a database what your potential (71:43 - 71:46)
return on an investment is (71:45 - 71:48)
that's very true this is very very (71:46 - 71:50)
chilling (71:48 - 71:52)
there's still a bandana i put it up on (71:50 - 71:55)
ebay and say bandana from i don't know (71:52 - 71:55)
when (71:55 - 71:56)
and i don't know where it just got (71:55 - 72:01)
pokemon on it five thousand dollars (71:56 - 72:01)
uh we'll have no pokemon of the week (72:01 - 72:04)
because uh will is not here (72:03 - 72:08)
but i do want al's impressions on (72:04 - 72:08)
pokemon (72:08 - 72:11)
snap oh (72:08 - 72:13)
yeah i've actually not played a huge (72:11 - 72:14)
amount of it (72:13 - 72:17)
um and so i i suspect i'll not have a (72:14 - 72:18)
huge amount interesting (72:17 - 72:21)
i'm not the the i've played it for a few (72:18 - 72:22)
hours um (72:21 - 72:25)
and generally i think it's fun um (72:22 - 72:28)
i don't think it's my kind of game (72:25 - 72:30)
like i will play through it i will spend (72:28 - 72:32)
a ridiculous amount of time playing (72:30 - 72:33)
through all and completing it because (72:32 - 72:35)
that's what i do right i complete things (72:33 - 72:38)
even if i'm not enjoying them but (72:35 - 72:41)
why because i (72:38 - 72:43)
have a lot of bad habits but i don't (72:41 - 72:45)
have that one (72:43 - 72:48)
why if you're not having a good time (72:45 - 72:51)
just leave it luke like i mean (72:48 - 72:54)
alex (72:51 - 72:54)
that's not true i walked out of one oh (72:54 - 72:58)
okay (72:57 - 73:01)
silent hill oh well valid (72:58 - 73:05)
yeah did not like that um (73:01 - 73:07)
but no other than that no of course not (73:05 - 73:09)
why would i have paid my money (73:07 - 73:11)
uh (73:09 - 73:11)
what the reason why i'm very happy (73:12 - 73:20)
i suspect my uh my nephews will enjoy (73:21 - 73:25)
the game (73:24 - 73:26)
very much and that's why i'm glad i (73:25 - 73:28)
bought it it's fine (73:26 - 73:30)
right i get why people like it and i (73:28 - 73:32)
think it's a really good idea and you (73:30 - 73:32)
know (73:32 - 73:34)
let's be honest if they do a third one i (73:32 - 73:36)
will probably buy that as well because i (73:34 - 73:37)
buy all things pokemon (73:36 - 73:42)
uh but i yeah it's (73:37 - 73:43)
maybe it's the sort of thing that once (73:42 - 73:46)
you get um once i get more into it i (73:43 - 73:46)
will probably (73:46 - 73:48)
get hooked i think that's part of my (73:46 - 73:50)
issue is that when i start a game (73:48 - 73:53)
there's like a time period where i f go (73:50 - 73:54)
on and off with it (73:53 - 73:55)
until i actually go right no now i've (73:54 - 73:58)
got it and i'm in and i'm hooked for 40 (73:55 - 73:59)
hours (73:58 - 74:02)
um yeah (73:59 - 74:02)
i think and i don't know i don't know if (74:03 - 74:06)
we mentioned this but i (74:05 - 74:09)
do it's so funny that it took over 20 (74:06 - 74:10)
years (74:09 - 74:14)
for a sequel to a game that people (74:10 - 74:18)
wanted uh for a very long time right (74:14 - 74:19)
like even when pokemon like (74:18 - 74:22)
i don't know when sequel fever ever (74:19 - 74:24)
happened i don't know if like (74:22 - 74:26)
everyone always wants a sequel to (74:24 - 74:27)
something or everyone wants to sequel to (74:26 - 74:29)
a movie or a video game i don't (74:27 - 74:32)
like i was a dumb kid when snap came out (74:29 - 74:32)
and (74:32 - 74:34)
the internet wasn't a thing until (74:32 - 74:35)
several years after (74:34 - 74:39)
so like well for you (74:35 - 74:42)
i was not a dumb kid it was definitely a (74:39 - 74:42)
thing (74:42 - 74:45)
when i was playing snap oh very poor (74:42 - 74:48)
family we can afford the aol dial up at (74:45 - 74:50)
the time greg (74:48 - 74:53)
how did you not have 50 000 free hours (74:50 - 74:54)
from discs (74:53 - 74:57)
just spread her out of your house i mean (74:54 - 74:59)
you look at somebody like him on an aol (74:57 - 75:00)
disc it's free (74:59 - 75:02)
so i i don't know what the i don't know (75:00 - 75:04)
like the opinion at the time was (75:02 - 75:05)
obviously as i got older and (75:04 - 75:07)
everyone wants you know sequels to (75:05 - 75:09)
everything but (75:07 - 75:12)
um (75:09 - 75:14)
they did like the snap just did so many (75:12 - 75:15)
things (75:14 - 75:18)
right that like on the show weeks (75:15 - 75:20)
like weeks and months up to like i don't (75:18 - 75:22)
know if snap's gonna be good (75:20 - 75:24)
it's because they have but to be fair (75:22 - 75:25)
they had a pretty low bar (75:24 - 75:28)
i mean like snap is like a six-hour game (75:25 - 75:30)
it's very short it's very (75:28 - 75:32)
like i wouldn't say it's shallow like it (75:30 - 75:34)
does have replayability there is reasons (75:32 - 75:36)
to go back (75:34 - 75:38)
um but yeah you can find that with any (75:36 - 75:39)
game realistically yeah (75:38 - 75:42)
yeah you know um but the whole like even (75:39 - 75:43)
when they said like oh there's going to (75:42 - 75:44)
be like 200 (75:43 - 75:47)
some pokemon there's 214. uh and a lot (75:44 - 75:49)
of people were like that's not enough (75:47 - 75:51)
but they did make it feel enough just (75:49 - 75:53)
because so many pokemon have (75:51 - 75:56)
incredible personalities and there's (75:53 - 75:57)
this like weird (75:56 - 76:00)
um not a hidden mechanic but there's (75:57 - 76:01)
like this weird like (76:00 - 76:04)
oh it's some of these interactions are (76:01 - 76:05)
very rare (76:04 - 76:07)
and or very specific and when you do (76:05 - 76:10)
those they feel good so i i (76:07 - 76:12)
think that like it is it is pretty much (76:10 - 76:13)
a perfect sequel i don't know (76:12 - 76:16)
i mean there's flaws and there's (76:13 - 76:17)
complaints (76:16 - 76:20)
but i don't know if any other company (76:17 - 76:22)
could have done it better like i just (76:20 - 76:24)
think it's it's really great i (76:22 - 76:27)
it's just it's a very solid to me 60 (76:24 - 76:28)
purchase (76:27 - 76:30)
it does it does feel weird the whole if (76:28 - 76:32)
you've left something for 20 (76:30 - 76:34)
20 years we're now going to to redo it (76:32 - 76:35)
but (76:34 - 76:36)
i wonder whether it's one of these (76:35 - 76:38)
things where they have like this (76:36 - 76:41)
whiteboard somewhere in the pokemon (76:38 - 76:43)
company's headquarters which just has (76:41 - 76:45)
like a list of (76:43 - 76:47)
games that we maybe want to do at some (76:45 - 76:49)
point but they just (76:47 - 76:52)
hadn't found the right partner right (76:49 - 76:54)
because i think because it is bandai (76:52 - 76:56)
namco isn't it and they yeah (76:54 - 76:58)
they did [ __ ] tournament and is that (76:56 - 77:00)
the only pokemon game they've done (76:58 - 77:01)
before snap the two pokemon (77:00 - 77:03)
into an tournament i think so yeah cause (77:01 - 77:05)
there was a there was an interview (77:03 - 77:07)
saying that (77:05 - 77:10)
they were super happy with how they did (77:07 - 77:12)
pokken so they wanted to work with them (77:10 - 77:13)
again (77:12 - 77:15)
i suspect they're quite specific about (77:13 - 77:16)
who they work with (77:15 - 77:19)
and you know that they're not going to (77:16 - 77:20)
waste game freaks time with with a side (77:19 - 77:23)
game right that's not where the money is (77:20 - 77:26)
um and so if they're if they have a very (77:23 - 77:28)
small list of partners that they're (77:26 - 77:29)
willing to work with (77:28 - 77:32)
they're not going to suddenly disrupt (77:29 - 77:36)
one of their ongoing projects to start (77:32 - 77:38)
doing something like this and then once (77:36 - 77:40)
they'd finish broken tournament or (77:38 - 77:42)
dx or whatever the the deal was maybe (77:40 - 77:44)
they have multiple teams in (77:42 - 77:45)
bandai that were working on it but they (77:44 - 77:47)
were then happy with them and like well (77:45 - 77:48)
maybe this is the (77:47 - 77:51)
the time to go for it yeah i had i had (77:48 - 77:52)
somebody (77:51 - 77:54)
come into my twitch chat and say like i (77:52 - 77:55)
wonder when they're gonna make pokken (77:54 - 77:57)
tournament too (77:55 - 78:00)
and i was like well they just finished (77:57 - 78:02)
they just finished pokemon snap yeah (78:00 - 78:04)
well number one they just finished snap (78:02 - 78:05)
number two (78:04 - 78:08)
is the the producer we talked about this (78:05 - 78:09)
on the show like a month ago said that (78:08 - 78:11)
like he would love to do pokken 2 (78:09 - 78:13)
is but it's not his choice it's right (78:11 - 78:15)
the pokemon company's choice (78:13 - 78:19)
and their response was well (78:15 - 78:21)
it's the response was do you think the (78:19 - 78:22)
pokemon snap team (78:21 - 78:24)
worked on pokken tournament and my (78:22 - 78:26)
response was (78:24 - 78:29)
yeah that's why (78:26 - 78:32)
that's why they hired them to do it like (78:29 - 78:33)
i don't think it's the whole (78:32 - 78:36)
team like there are probably specific (78:33 - 78:38)
people on a team that balance fighting (78:36 - 78:40)
mechanics and there are probably (78:38 - 78:42)
specific people on the team that made (78:40 - 78:44)
the backgrounds to poken tournament that (78:42 - 78:45)
have no clue how a fighting mechanic (78:44 - 78:46)
works (78:45 - 78:49)
but it's like very obvious i don't maybe (78:46 - 78:50)
i don't know maybe it's not obvious to (78:49 - 78:52)
me it was obvious that like (78:50 - 78:54)
in interviews when they said we were (78:52 - 78:55)
happy with pokemon tournaments so we're (78:54 - 78:57)
excited to work with them again for new (78:55 - 78:58)
pokemon snap (78:57 - 79:00)
sounds like i don't know probably (78:58 - 79:02)
similar people worked on it (79:00 - 79:05)
and i suspect they're not going to do (79:02 - 79:07)
an another pokemon i mean maybe it'll be (79:05 - 79:08)
a snap type thing where they do it in 20 (79:07 - 79:09)
years but like i don't think they have (79:08 - 79:11)
plans to do it in the next few years (79:09 - 79:15)
because i feel like (79:11 - 79:18)
that's it for pokken and um (79:15 - 79:20)
unites basically taking its place in (79:18 - 79:22)
terms of like like a competitive (79:20 - 79:24)
game yeah yeah exactly they don't want (79:22 - 79:26)
to have too many things going on (79:24 - 79:27)
at once and i don't think they'll want (79:26 - 79:29)
to go (79:27 - 79:31)
these weekends that they pack everything (79:29 - 79:32)
yeah sure sure (79:31 - 79:34)
but but in terms of you got to think (79:32 - 79:35)
about worlds they still have a very (79:34 - 79:37)
limited space in worlds right even if (79:35 - 79:39)
they buy the biggest conference (79:37 - 79:41)
halls they can't suddenly add another (79:39 - 79:42)
game into that (79:41 - 79:45)
and can you imagine they go right we're (79:42 - 79:47)
releasing pokken tournament two (79:45 - 79:49)
no competitive scene for it we're not (79:47 - 79:50)
going to have it at worlds that would (79:49 - 79:52)
sound dreadful (79:50 - 79:54)
i mean they they are in a position where (79:52 - 79:55)
they could add more stuff if they wanted (79:54 - 79:57)
to but they choose not to (79:55 - 80:00)
they could be like hey we're supporting (79:57 - 80:01)
singles (80:00 - 80:04)
but they don't they only support doubles (80:01 - 80:05)
it's just too much you can't you can't (80:04 - 80:06)
support everything at worlds (80:05 - 80:08)
being a physical thing there's just not (80:06 - 80:10)
enough time and you have to support the (80:08 - 80:12)
lead up too right like you have to (80:10 - 80:14)
support people getting points and local (80:12 - 80:15)
tournaments and everything (80:14 - 80:18)
um that's not any shade at pokken like i (80:15 - 80:18)
think pokken (80:18 - 80:21)
surprised everyone with the legs that it (80:18 - 80:22)
had (80:21 - 80:25)
uh but (80:22 - 80:26)
this is what i was saying with the dlc (80:25 - 80:28)
conversation (80:26 - 80:30)
like if they were happy with pokken and (80:28 - 80:32)
now they're happy with new pokemon snap (80:30 - 80:32)
and i (80:32 - 80:34)
i think so like i'm sure that game is (80:32 - 80:36)
selling well and i'm sure (80:34 - 80:38)
uh like i don't see too many negative (80:36 - 80:40)
responses (80:38 - 80:43)
um why would they not want bando nam kai (80:40 - 80:46)
namco bandai to do another game like (80:43 - 80:46)
they're like (80:46 - 80:48)
yeah i think that's exactly what they'll (80:46 - 80:50)
do something else (80:48 - 80:52)
completely different i would love to see (80:50 - 80:53)
them do something different (80:52 - 80:55)
this something completely different and (80:53 - 80:57)
i i think with (80:55 - 80:59)
with now i'm like almost 70 hours in the (80:57 - 81:00)
snap still not done with the pokedex i (80:59 - 81:02)
need three more pokemon still i was like (81:00 - 81:03)
still want (81:02 - 81:05)
i'm still i have 600 of like 800 (81:03 - 81:06)
pictures done (81:05 - 81:09)
like i i want to get all the pictures um (81:06 - 81:12)
and then i look at like a sequel to snap (81:09 - 81:14)
and i think new pokemon snap is probably (81:12 - 81:16)
the best sequel they could have done and (81:14 - 81:17)
then i look at stuff like (81:16 - 81:20)
the mystery dungeon port on switch and (81:17 - 81:21)
it just (81:20 - 81:24)
doesn't feel it's just it's the same (81:21 - 81:26)
and i guess i was so worried with snap (81:24 - 81:27)
that it was going to be like oh (81:26 - 81:29)
yep it's just the same it's just like a (81:27 - 81:31)
six hour you know play at once i guess (81:29 - 81:33)
you could play it twice or three times (81:31 - 81:35)
but they went above and beyond (81:33 - 81:37)
and i kind of wish they would do that (81:35 - 81:38)
for like mystery dungeon or the (81:37 - 81:41)
these other pokemon games like so many (81:38 - 81:42)
people (81:41 - 81:44)
so many people were like i want a remake (81:42 - 81:45)
i want a remake i want a remake and it's (81:44 - 81:47)
like i played it like i've been there (81:45 - 81:49)
i've done maybe you didn't play it and (81:47 - 81:50)
you want a remake but like for the (81:49 - 81:52)
longest time people were like i want (81:50 - 81:54)
diamond pro remix look dude i just (81:52 - 81:57)
like i play diamond and pearl after 10 (81:54 - 81:58)
years i played it again (81:57 - 82:00)
i just played it like last year on my (81:58 - 82:02)
twitch stream like i get i get it (82:00 - 82:05)
so i'm a little hesitant with uh what (82:02 - 82:06)
did what was the word they (82:05 - 82:09)
said like or like perfect remakes or (82:06 - 82:10)
whatever (82:09 - 82:12)
for diamond and pearl or faithful oh (82:10 - 82:14)
faithful yeah (82:12 - 82:17)
i'm a little hesitant with that kind of (82:14 - 82:19)
stuff because it's like (82:17 - 82:22)
new pokemon snap just blew me away and (82:19 - 82:23)
what it did (82:22 - 82:25)
with everything and even with let's go (82:23 - 82:27)
like i don't think let's go pikachu (82:25 - 82:28)
let's go eev is a perfect game (82:27 - 82:31)
but it gosh that game had so much charm (82:28 - 82:32)
and it was just so (82:31 - 82:34)
genuinely fun to play even if it was (82:32 - 82:35)
like easy (82:34 - 82:38)
um it was just like a blast to walk (82:35 - 82:40)
around and see pokemon and (82:38 - 82:42)
um and i want more of that like if i (82:40 - 82:44)
want yeah (82:42 - 82:46)
i do think that the terum faithful remix (82:44 - 82:48)
remake was a mistake (82:46 - 82:50)
on their part but i think i think it is (82:48 - 82:52)
entirely there to tell people (82:50 - 82:54)
we're bringing the we're keeping the (82:52 - 82:55)
catch mechanic we're not we're not doing (82:54 - 82:57)
the let's go pikachu (82:55 - 82:59)
i mean i think that is the entire reason (82:57 - 83:00)
that (82:59 - 83:02)
phrase existed i mean it's a pitfall (83:00 - 83:03)
either way like (83:02 - 83:05)
yeah if you don't say that you're being (83:03 - 83:07)
faithful to the original game you're (83:05 - 83:09)
angering all the people that want their (83:07 - 83:10)
game back (83:09 - 83:13)
if you when you say it you you anger (83:10 - 83:14)
other people who are like (83:13 - 83:16)
well you're gonna make all these (83:14 - 83:18)
horrible choices and i'm gonna have to (83:16 - 83:19)
have (83:18 - 83:22)
5 billion hms again if you want to tell (83:19 - 83:24)
us information show us the information (83:22 - 83:24)
right (83:24 - 83:27)
they they said this after a trailer (83:24 - 83:29)
right i am 100 certain that the reason (83:27 - 83:31)
was the catch mechanic if you want to (83:29 - 83:32)
show us the catch mechanic shows the (83:31 - 83:33)
catch mechanic in the trailer that you (83:32 - 83:34)
just released (83:33 - 83:38)
right like trying to get across (83:34 - 83:40)
specific information with these phrases (83:38 - 83:42)
that people then take and run with them (83:40 - 83:42)
and go (83:42 - 83:43)
oh well that means we've got the (83:42 - 83:46)
underground and it means we won't have (83:43 - 83:48)
any new pokemon and like you're you're (83:46 - 83:49)
reading too much into it (83:48 - 83:50)
and you know that people read too much (83:49 - 83:52)
into things why are you using (83:50 - 83:54)
vague terms like that it doesn't make (83:52 - 83:56)
any sense right like (83:54 - 83:58)
like diamond pearl introduced the gts is (83:56 - 84:00)
it going to actually have a gps why (83:58 - 84:00)
would (84:00 - 84:03)
like a company who made the gts and (84:00 - 84:05)
pokemon home is making this game why (84:03 - 84:06)
would they duplicate the work (84:05 - 84:10)
you're stuck with you're stuck with (84:06 - 84:13)
ad writers that have to sell a game (84:10 - 84:14)
you're stuck with a trailer that's made (84:13 - 84:16)
with what they have done so (84:14 - 84:19)
far and they could get a team together (84:16 - 84:20)
to make something that looks like it was (84:19 - 84:21)
a finished game (84:20 - 84:24)
when they're nowhere near being finished (84:21 - 84:26)
sure but we're talking about the same (84:24 - 84:29)
company that (84:26 - 84:31)
micromanages the stuff that is released (84:29 - 84:33)
in other games (84:31 - 84:36)
and and they can't even get get the idea (84:33 - 84:37)
of what they actually want to get across (84:36 - 84:38)
in a trailer (84:37 - 84:40)
like i think part i do think part of the (84:38 - 84:41)
issue is we and (84:40 - 84:45)
they announce games too too soon (84:41 - 84:47)
right there's far too much time and (84:45 - 84:48)
especially (84:47 - 84:51)
you know our case making sure i say the (84:48 - 84:53)
name right (84:51 - 84:55)
you know that was specifically way too (84:53 - 84:57)
early why they announced it a year (84:55 - 85:01)
before it comes out i have no idea (84:57 - 85:01)
oh what you know why are you releasing a (85:02 - 85:06)
remake i want a new game there might be (85:04 - 85:07)
some people doing that (85:06 - 85:10)
but like most people would be perfectly (85:07 - 85:11)
happy with just the knowledge of the (85:10 - 85:13)
remakes coming in november and knowing (85:11 - 85:14)
uh there might be something in a year (85:13 - 85:15)
after that (85:14 - 85:17)
we don't need to know that game's coming (85:15 - 85:18)
out in in (85:17 - 85:22)
q1 next year they're they're so (85:18 - 85:25)
bad at gosh now that you (85:22 - 85:27)
they're so bad at just communication (85:25 - 85:29)
like yeah again (85:27 - 85:30)
we say this all the time why are we just (85:29 - 85:32)
getting sword and shield events like (85:30 - 85:33)
why why are we getting the press (85:32 - 85:35)
releases on friday morning when the (85:33 - 85:36)
event starts on thursday night why is (85:35 - 85:37)
there no heads up (85:36 - 85:40)
why did you announce detective pikachu (85:37 - 85:40)
for switch (85:40 - 85:42)
and then show us nothing for over a year (85:40 - 85:44)
why did you announce pokemon sleep (85:42 - 85:47)
maybe again this is me defending sleep (85:44 - 85:49)
trying to defend sleep (85:47 - 85:51)
uh maybe they did plan for it to come (85:49 - 85:52)
out (85:51 - 85:54)
and they can't ship a mobile game (85:52 - 85:55)
without a physical device (85:54 - 85:57)
and it is very hard to make physical (85:55 - 85:58)
devices right now i mean (85:57 - 86:01)
ford can't even get ships for their cars (85:58 - 86:02)
so they can't make cars (86:01 - 86:05)
yeah uh like apple had to do apple the (86:02 - 86:07)
richest company in the world (86:05 - 86:09)
had to delay their iphone a month last (86:07 - 86:11)
year so yes i do (86:09 - 86:14)
think that sleep was probably delayed (86:11 - 86:16)
because of not being able to put out (86:14 - 86:18)
that plus plus thing (86:16 - 86:20)
because they can't make enough of it i (86:18 - 86:21)
mean when they put out pokemon go with (86:20 - 86:23)
the go plus (86:21 - 86:25)
it sold out in like a day because they (86:23 - 86:27)
didn't make enough of them yeah (86:25 - 86:30)
we live in a very complicated (86:27 - 86:33)
advertising world where we are we have (86:30 - 86:35)
companies that have to appease (86:33 - 86:39)
their investors as well as continue (86:35 - 86:42)
people being excited in their brand and (86:39 - 86:44)
one of the best ways for them to do that (86:42 - 86:44)
is announce (86:44 - 86:46)
all of their upcoming plans that people (86:44 - 86:48)
will talk about (86:46 - 86:50)
all of these things and speculate and (86:48 - 86:51)
keep it going (86:50 - 86:54)
in the conversation so it is an (86:51 - 86:57)
advertising technique to be deliberately (86:54 - 86:57)
vague (86:57 - 87:00)
to generate constant talking (86:57 - 87:03)
about the stuff like there's not a way (87:00 - 87:05)
to win (87:03 - 87:08)
advertising apart from getting people to (87:05 - 87:10)
always talk about your product (87:08 - 87:12)
and people are used to in world of (87:10 - 87:13)
kickstarters (87:12 - 87:16)
and delay products that they'll announce (87:13 - 87:17)
it's coming out next year (87:16 - 87:18)
they won't give an end date and it's (87:17 - 87:21)
delayed the delay is part of people's (87:18 - 87:22)
expectations because (87:21 - 87:25)
everything is delayed but the excitement (87:22 - 87:27)
is what they need to get at the times (87:25 - 87:29)
when they have an investor board coming (87:27 - 87:31)
up and they can say (87:29 - 87:32)
look at all the engagement for these two (87:31 - 87:35)
products please keep investing in us (87:32 - 87:37)
yeah but they want it both ways though (87:35 - 87:39)
that's the problem right they want to (87:37 - 87:40)
have (87:39 - 87:41)
this long information of these are the (87:40 - 87:43)
games coming out but they then don't (87:41 - 87:44)
want to actually give you any (87:43 - 87:46)
information about that to stop (87:44 - 87:48)
people getting disappointed right and i (87:46 - 87:50)
don't like to blame the companies too (87:48 - 87:52)
much for people's stupid expectations (87:50 - 87:53)
but they do know that this happens and (87:52 - 87:55)
they could deal with it (87:53 - 87:56)
like we're talking about sleep for (87:55 - 87:58)
example they could easily say oh yeah (87:56 - 88:00)
it is still coming like they put an (87:58 - 88:01)
investor's note or something saying we (88:00 - 88:03)
are still working on this (88:01 - 88:05)
right but the pandemic has delayed it (88:03 - 88:07)
that's easy to do and would (88:05 - 88:09)
stop people going maybe it's been (88:07 - 88:10)
cancelled it's not being cancelled come (88:09 - 88:12)
on of course it's not being counted see (88:10 - 88:13)
the only reason (88:12 - 88:15)
i don't think sleep was canceled or (88:13 - 88:17)
delayed is because (88:15 - 88:20)
what is then select button working on (88:17 - 88:21)
like (88:20 - 88:23)
yeah if it was cancelled or delayed then (88:21 - 88:24)
they need to come out with something (88:23 - 88:25)
else (88:24 - 88:27)
so they can pay their bills i mean i (88:25 - 88:28)
also think they're not (88:27 - 88:30)
i think they are successfully having it (88:28 - 88:32)
both ways sword and shield (88:30 - 88:36)
souls like gangbusters everything sounds (88:32 - 88:37)
like gangbusters (88:36 - 88:40)
sure like they are play they are walking (88:37 - 88:42)
a very fine line and they are walking (88:40 - 88:43)
along (88:42 - 88:47)
again every company is always searching (88:43 - 88:48)
for the line (88:47 - 88:52)
of how how they can build anticipation (88:48 - 88:54)
without it (88:52 - 88:57)
boiling over into resentment and the the (88:54 - 88:58)
bad thing (88:57 - 89:00)
that we as consumers have is we have (88:58 - 89:01)
very (89:00 - 89:04)
few outlets to see what they see (89:01 - 89:07)
like twitter and reddit are not great (89:04 - 89:09)
markers of how people are (89:07 - 89:12)
actually feeling no um the internet in (89:09 - 89:12)
general (89:12 - 89:16)
like isn't a great way to (89:12 - 89:18)
to get how people are are feeling what (89:16 - 89:20)
what is for them (89:18 - 89:23)
is how many times does their name come (89:20 - 89:25)
up in searches how is it trending (89:23 - 89:27)
is it good and and that is what they are (89:25 - 89:28)
going for (89:27 - 89:32)
and sales haven't yeah i mean sales (89:28 - 89:32)
hasn't (89:32 - 89:34)
had didn't dip for sword and shield (89:32 - 89:36)
despite having quote unquote (89:34 - 89:39)
terrible trees and a bad animations like (89:36 - 89:43)
it sold like gangbusters and (89:39 - 89:45)
there was a growing wave of people (89:43 - 89:47)
actively angry at the people who were (89:45 - 89:48)
judging it beforehand (89:47 - 89:51)
and were openly defending their game (89:48 - 89:53)
like that is a win-win-win for a (89:51 - 89:54)
corporation (89:53 - 89:57)
yeah fair stupid (89:54 - 89:59)
it's stupid but it's how it's how the (89:57 - 90:01)
world works right now yeah (89:59 - 90:03)
no you're right you're right talking is (90:01 - 90:04)
still press yeah if it's negative (90:03 - 90:05)
talking like (90:04 - 90:08)
the the number of times i'm not saying i (90:05 - 90:10)
have bought things out of spite (90:08 - 90:12)
but i have gotten close in some cases (90:10 - 90:14)
and it's certainly changed (90:12 - 90:16)
it's maybe pushed me over the edge um (90:14 - 90:17)
just just (90:16 - 90:19)
yeah just despite i bought snap on this (90:17 - 90:20)
bite (90:19 - 90:23)
[Laughter] (90:20 - 90:26)
i'm very happy with snaps (90:23 - 90:26)
it's a very good looking game i'll give (90:28 - 90:31)
you that (90:30 - 90:35)
i mean i i don't want to ever discourage (90:31 - 90:36)
or make it sound like (90:35 - 90:37)
[Music] (90:36 - 90:40)
for me it's frustrating and i think greg (90:37 - 90:41)
sees that firsthand because greg (90:40 - 90:44)
watches my twitch streams but when the (90:41 - 90:44)
the uh (90:44 - 90:48)
where people's minds go with with (90:44 - 90:51)
like with 30 seconds of beta (90:48 - 90:54)
maybe not even beta footage of arceus (90:51 - 90:55)
and people being like this is going to (90:54 - 90:57)
be the greatest game ever it's going to (90:55 - 90:59)
be an mmo it's going to be (90:57 - 91:02)
a million hours long and it's like (90:59 - 91:06)
you got so wild i like how old are you (91:02 - 91:09)
yeah with some wild expectations for 30 (91:06 - 91:11)
seconds of video game footage (91:09 - 91:14)
i also think people don't want that yeah (91:11 - 91:15)
like as much as they say they don't (91:14 - 91:17)
actually want to (91:15 - 91:19)
i want some of it but people just don't (91:17 - 91:21)
have a good people need to learn to (91:19 - 91:22)
manage (91:21 - 91:23)
like it's fun to spend i love (91:22 - 91:26)
speculating about a million things (91:23 - 91:28)
but i've also learned how to be like (91:26 - 91:29)
also this is (91:28 - 91:31)
this is what they gave me do i enjoy it (91:29 - 91:32)
yes or no (91:31 - 91:35)
whether or not it's it's it meant what i (91:32 - 91:37)
thought it should be (91:35 - 91:40)
like i think there's a critical skill (91:37 - 91:42)
that we aren't really teaching (91:40 - 91:45)
actively in this sort of new world of (91:42 - 91:46)
your brand (91:45 - 91:48)
is also your identity like that is the (91:46 - 91:52)
advertising thing is how to manage (91:48 - 91:56)
your own expectations and understand (91:52 - 91:58)
that difference that there there is a (91:56 - 91:59)
line there that you will never cross (91:58 - 92:01)
like you are never going to convince a (91:59 - 92:03)
company to do something (92:01 - 92:04)
that they had already planned on doing (92:03 - 92:06)
two years ago because you're mad about (92:04 - 92:07)
it on twitter (92:06 - 92:10)
right like yeah this is not a thing (92:07 - 92:11)
that's going to happen (92:10 - 92:15)
the bring back national decks (92:11 - 92:15)
didn't do anything and people keep (92:15 - 92:18)
talking about like oh we'll just keep (92:16 - 92:20)
hammering with them and they'll finally (92:18 - 92:22)
listen (92:20 - 92:26)
to an extent like they are listening to (92:22 - 92:30)
are are you gathering enough people (92:26 - 92:32)
that it is a problem and clearly that (92:30 - 92:34)
didn't play out for sword and shield (92:32 - 92:36)
the amount of effect you have on a (92:34 - 92:37)
company (92:36 - 92:40)
about decisions they made at the start (92:37 - 92:41)
of a project (92:40 - 92:44)
which was four years ago is very (92:41 - 92:47)
little yeah yeah i mean there's also (92:44 - 92:50)
like the conversation of like (92:47 - 92:53)
they they have to make money and time is (92:50 - 92:54)
money (92:53 - 92:55)
right like at the end of the day they're (92:54 - 92:58)
a company so there are still people that (92:55 - 92:58)
are like (92:58 - 92:59)
oh well they're eventually going to add (92:58 - 93:01)
the rest of the pokemon to sword and (92:59 - 93:01)
shield (93:01 - 93:04)
why why why like why would they (93:01 - 93:08)
it sold 21 million copies do you think (93:04 - 93:09)
that there's like (93:08 - 93:12)
20 million people waiting for for (93:09 - 93:13)
[Music] (93:12 - 93:15)
for like kokuna to get added to this (93:13 - 93:17)
game like no (93:15 - 93:20)
like it's like it's just not worth their (93:17 - 93:21)
time (93:20 - 93:22)
and you think anyone who's actually not (93:21 - 93:24)
bought it would still buy it (93:22 - 93:26)
like they're they're still going to have (93:24 - 93:28)
something to complain about and a reason (93:26 - 93:29)
not to buy it at that point (93:28 - 93:31)
like those of us i mean i'm not going to (93:29 - 93:33)
be i'm not going to lie (93:31 - 93:34)
i do wish that all the pokemon were in (93:33 - 93:37)
the game yeah but i bought it anyway (93:34 - 93:40)
yeah because it's a good game i had so (93:37 - 93:41)
much fun in that game it's probably my (93:40 - 93:44)
second most played pokemon game (93:41 - 93:47)
yeah i mean it it's just it's just like (93:44 - 93:48)
the (93:47 - 93:52)
the people that (93:48 - 93:52)
um it's just like the people who want (93:52 - 93:56)
pokemon games to be harder (93:54 - 93:58)
yeah sure like it'd be cool if the game (93:56 - 94:00)
was harder but like is that going to (93:58 - 94:01)
sell (94:00 - 94:04)
five to six million more copies and even (94:01 - 94:07)
if they do go back and add the rest of (94:04 - 94:09)
the pokemon to sword and shield (94:07 - 94:12)
how much time is that cutting off from a (94:09 - 94:13)
new game (94:12 - 94:16)
uh is that like six months of work is (94:13 - 94:17)
that three months of work is that eight (94:16 - 94:19)
months of work like what (94:17 - 94:23)
yeah it's just like you have such a (94:19 - 94:26)
small vocal minority that wants (94:23 - 94:27)
something (94:26 - 94:30)
that like in the long run for the (94:27 - 94:31)
company it's just (94:30 - 94:34)
not worth it it's like (94:31 - 94:36)
they're very good yeah the pokemon (94:34 - 94:37)
company is (94:36 - 94:40)
very good at making a game (94:37 - 94:44)
or a product to appeal to as many people (94:40 - 94:45)
as possible (94:44 - 94:50)
which is what most brands want to do (94:45 - 94:50)
unless you're unless you're a specific (94:50 - 94:54)
luxury brand (94:52 - 94:57)
like um like coach (94:54 - 94:59)
mccoach isn't even a good example but (94:57 - 95:00)
like think of a purse brand (94:59 - 95:04)
like they they don't need (95:00 - 95:06)
the general public they just need a (95:04 - 95:08)
dedicated hardcore fan base because they (95:06 - 95:09)
sell (95:08 - 95:12)
products at a and again coach is not a (95:09 - 95:13)
good example because they're not the (95:12 - 95:14)
most expensive (95:13 - 95:17)
purses but they're pretty pricey you go (95:14 - 95:19)
to target get a purse for 14 (95:17 - 95:20)
you go to coach that same person is (95:19 - 95:22)
going to be 120 right like they don't (95:20 - 95:26)
need a huge audience right pokemon (95:22 - 95:27)
but that's not pokemon they want the (95:26 - 95:29)
biggest audience possible (95:27 - 95:31)
um they don't need they're not selling (95:29 - 95:32)
two hundred dollars (95:31 - 95:35)
of games for you know the hardcore fans (95:32 - 95:36)
to buy (95:35 - 95:39)
it's also hard we don't know what the (95:36 - 95:40)
next generation is (95:39 - 95:42)
like we don't know what their plan is we (95:40 - 95:44)
don't know what their art style is like (95:42 - 95:47)
it's hard to say that like if (95:44 - 95:50)
generation 9 uses the same engine and (95:47 - 95:52)
they're building a different set of (95:50 - 95:54)
pokemon to go into gen 9 which we assume (95:52 - 95:55)
they do (95:54 - 95:58)
it is perhaps possible that they could (95:55 - 96:00)
have have a team to go back and say (95:58 - 96:03)
we're gonna do a final dlc (96:00 - 96:07)
for sword and shield but (96:03 - 96:11)
it's not just updating one game (96:07 - 96:14)
it's it's pulling focus away from the (96:11 - 96:16)
their other products that they want you (96:14 - 96:18)
invested in like (96:16 - 96:20)
for all we know they have all the (96:18 - 96:21)
animations done (96:20 - 96:23)
it's the same engine they're building it (96:21 - 96:25)
for gen 9 they could just dump them into (96:23 - 96:27)
shield right now (96:25 - 96:30)
but there is not that (96:27 - 96:34)
stops so many other aspects of the train (96:30 - 96:36)
and pulls away from where they want to (96:34 - 96:37)
be as a company (96:36 - 96:40)
that even if they have it done marketing (96:37 - 96:41)
and everybody else might (96:40 - 96:44)
say that's great but we can't we have we (96:41 - 96:47)
have to sell copies of the diamond and (96:44 - 96:49)
pearl remakes and then we have to sell (96:47 - 96:49)
copies (96:49 - 96:52)
of arceus and then we have to sell (96:49 - 96:53)
copies of the thing (96:52 - 96:56)
after and there's not a good time for us (96:53 - 96:58)
to just drop a dlc in the middle of (96:56 - 96:59)
everything (96:58 - 97:02)
yeah and and ruin two years (96:59 - 97:06)
of marketing plans yeah and it (97:02 - 97:09)
like even if it is just taking (97:06 - 97:10)
what you already have and putting in a (97:09 - 97:14)
game that's still work (97:10 - 97:14)
there are bugs in storage and shield (97:14 - 97:17)
that would probably only take a couple (97:16 - 97:19)
of days work to fix (97:17 - 97:20)
they're not doing it because it's not (97:19 - 97:23)
worth it to them (97:20 - 97:23)
yeah it's as simple as that (97:24 - 97:29)
all right uh let's wrap up with uh i (97:30 - 97:35)
thought that was a good place to end it (97:34 - 97:38)
uh let's wrap up with question of the (97:35 - 97:38)
week (97:38 - 97:42)
all right question of the week (97:38 - 97:44)
i can't wait to hear what you'll be (97:42 - 97:46)
asking (97:44 - 97:46)
all right oh i'm so good i was on (97:47 - 97:50)
vacation and i (97:49 - 97:52)
added it in this this is a good this (97:50 - 97:53)
goes bad (97:52 - 97:56)
the podcast comes full circle this is (97:53 - 97:57)
from alex (97:56 - 97:59)
what is the weirdest pokemon item you (97:57 - 98:00)
own (97:59 - 98:04)
giant plush butter dish etc (98:00 - 98:04)
wait wait oh (98:05 - 98:09)
weirdest item i own hmm you've got (98:10 - 98:15)
you've got a lot to choose from me (98:14 - 98:18)
welcome to my room oh wow (98:15 - 98:21)
control by a small wire (98:18 - 98:24)
psyduck that rolls is this fast person (98:21 - 98:25)
forward (98:24 - 98:28)
yeah it's from tommy oh it is all right (98:25 - 98:29)
all right an official partner of the (98:28 - 98:30)
pokemon company (98:29 - 98:33)
this is the pokemon (98:30 - 98:36)
romocon battler it does nothing it's (98:33 - 98:36)
never (98:36 - 98:38)
actually worked either probably because (98:36 - 98:39)
the batteries came dead (98:38 - 98:41)
but this is the weirdest thing i don't (98:39 - 98:42)
even know why i have it but it's just (98:41 - 98:45)
weird and it's never done anything (98:42 - 98:48)
everything else for me is plushes really (98:45 - 98:50)
i don't think it's that weird right now (98:48 - 98:52)
but in like 20 years the pokemon typing (98:50 - 98:54)
adventure (98:52 - 98:58)
will probably definitely stand out (98:54 - 99:02)
as a very weird thing that they did (98:58 - 99:02)
yeah i i certainly don't have a huge (99:03 - 99:07)
selection of things and i'm not sure i (99:05 - 99:08)
have anything weird (99:07 - 99:11)
what do you have is a little (99:08 - 99:14)
uh i don't know where's this plaster (99:11 - 99:15)
cast (99:14 - 99:18)
charmander that my older sister made me (99:15 - 99:19)
i (99:18 - 99:23)
it must be like 22 23 years ago (99:19 - 99:26)
and i like i'm not i'm not even kidding (99:23 - 99:28)
like that that is over 20 years old so (99:26 - 99:28)
it's probably like (99:28 - 99:32)
the oldest thing i have um (99:28 - 99:34)
other than i guess the original games (99:32 - 99:36)
okay so i'm pretty sure that this is (99:34 - 99:39)
a knockoff but this is my squirtle (99:36 - 99:43)
white board marker holder it just holds (99:39 - 99:46)
markers for a white board (99:43 - 99:49)
and it's squirtle that squirtle's very (99:46 - 99:50)
thick (99:49 - 99:52)
yeah it's you know he's a wide boy he's (99:50 - 99:54)
a white boy that's got to be (99:52 - 99:57)
protected by whiteboard markers also i'm (99:54 - 99:57)
pretty sure (99:57 - 100:01)
since i got this 15 years ago that these (99:57 - 100:02)
markers are dead (100:01 - 100:06)
and i think it opens um (100:02 - 100:08)
i do have this pikachu salt and pepper (100:06 - 100:09)
shakers (100:08 - 100:12)
no butter dish though (100:09 - 100:12)
uh i have a i have pokemon (100:13 - 100:18)
stamp rollers when that was a thing back (100:16 - 100:19)
in the 90s (100:18 - 100:22)
you just but when i oh i did eventually (100:19 - 100:23)
open it i was like (100:22 - 100:25)
why am i keeping the sealed i'm not (100:23 - 100:26)
going to resell it (100:25 - 100:29)
they're stamp rollers so when i opened (100:26 - 100:29)
it which was (100:29 - 100:31)
maybe a year or two ago the ink was all (100:29 - 100:32)
dried up and stuff because it was like (100:31 - 100:34)
20 years of (100:32 - 100:38)
collecting dust (100:34 - 100:41)
i guess i do have the um i have our (100:38 - 100:42)
pokemon card (100:41 - 100:45)
uh box here with the stickers from (100:42 - 100:49)
from nick's illustrations of the (100:45 - 100:52)
not pokemon does that count (100:49 - 100:56)
yeah that's a weird item yeah uh (100:52 - 100:58)
everything else i have is action figures (100:56 - 101:00)
i have myself this section (100:58 - 101:02)
this section definitely best to watch on (101:00 - 101:05)
youtube i i suggest for people (101:02 - 101:09)
i have the gill of darkness gamecube (101:05 - 101:13)
that's pretty cool they did a gamecube (101:09 - 101:15)
like exactly official one it's not like (101:13 - 101:16)
reaching no it's it's official yeah it's (101:15 - 101:19)
it was just a silver gamecube that has (101:16 - 101:20)
like oh yeah (101:19 - 101:22)
i remember the top part of it uh it's (101:20 - 101:24)
pretty beat up but (101:22 - 101:26)
yeah al has the pikachu 64. hold on do (101:24 - 101:29)
you have the pikachu n64 with uh with (101:26 - 101:30)
pokemon snap sitting in it (101:29 - 101:32)
there you go so that's probably my most (101:30 - 101:34)
exciting console (101:32 - 101:37)
i've got quite a lot i've got the (101:34 - 101:37)
gameboy (101:37 - 101:41)
and gba it's actually not as expensive (101:37 - 101:43)
as you'd think (101:41 - 101:48)
it's actually pretty good (101:43 - 101:48)
i have two of these (101:52 - 101:55)
oh of darkness custom (101:56 - 102:03)
why do you have two i don't know (102:00 - 102:08)
he was playing planning and sculpting uh (102:03 - 102:08)
days back in the 2000 what was that 2003 (102:08 - 102:14)
for gale of darkness (102:11 - 102:14)
why would i remember why i have two of (102:19 - 102:23)
these (102:22 - 102:26)
from amelia so actually actually (102:23 - 102:28)
the the most likely thing is is i did it (102:26 - 102:29)
on pre-order (102:28 - 102:32)
so they probably had one when i (102:29 - 102:33)
pre-ordered (102:32 - 102:35)
and then when i went to go pick up the (102:33 - 102:36)
game they had it again that's most (102:35 - 102:40)
likely how i ended up with two (102:36 - 102:43)
okay i just i i do expect people to (102:40 - 102:44)
remember these things probably because (102:43 - 102:46)
that's about the only thing i can (102:44 - 102:46)
remember in life (102:46 - 102:48)
like every single thing behind me i can (102:46 - 102:50)
tell you (102:48 - 102:53)
when i got it and how i got it i i (102:50 - 102:56)
used to it's i have now 51 years (102:53 - 102:59)
of collecting stuff and i'm (102:56 - 103:02)
willing myself to forget things because (102:59 - 103:02)
i'm like if i (103:02 - 103:05)
remember how i got them i'm less likely (103:02 - 103:06)
to throw them away so yeah i'm at the (103:05 - 103:07)
point where i'm like i don't remember (103:06 - 103:08)
how i got this (103:07 - 103:11)
check well the the question is like (103:08 - 103:12)
weirdest items (103:11 - 103:14)
uh so yeah for me it's probably salt and (103:12 - 103:16)
pepper shakers (103:14 - 103:18)
maybe an apr i have a i have a pikachu (103:16 - 103:19)
apron that's pretty weird did you buy (103:18 - 103:21)
all those dishes (103:19 - 103:23)
i didn't no i didn't get a bunch of the (103:21 - 103:25)
dishes i thought you got the milk when (103:23 - 103:28)
the stuff came off uh oh yeah i got the (103:25 - 103:29)
milk plate (103:28 - 103:30)
yeah it came with two moo moo bottles (103:29 - 103:33)
and then two moo moo plates and i got (103:30 - 103:34)
two (103:33 - 103:36)
one to keep sealed so i could put it (103:34 - 103:37)
next to my ancient mew (103:36 - 103:41)
and then one to use and using them was (103:37 - 103:42)
the worst thing i could have done (103:41 - 103:44)
because they were (103:42 - 103:47)
poorly made and just (103:44 - 103:50)
hand washing them caused the ink or (103:47 - 103:54)
whatever it's called to come off of it (103:50 - 103:55)
and then at this point it's just no (103:54 - 103:57)
throw in the dishwasher who cares at (103:55 - 103:57)
this point (103:57 - 103:59)
at that point it's the yeah at that (103:57 - 104:01)
point it's done for (103:59 - 104:02)
but i think that was like that was kind (104:01 - 104:04)
of you know somebody could probably say (104:02 - 104:07)
like oh i got the welch's grape (104:04 - 104:10)
uh the (104:07 - 104:14)
jars pokemon was on that yeah and i (104:10 - 104:16)
had those two i have one they probably (104:14 - 104:17)
went through the dishwasher so many (104:16 - 104:18)
times (104:17 - 104:20)
that i i don't know if you could tell (104:18 - 104:23)
their pokemon anymore (104:20 - 104:23)
if it doesn't have to be official stuff (104:23 - 104:27)
i do have my own pokemon card (104:25 - 104:30)
made for me by someone in slack oh nice (104:27 - 104:31)
which is (104:30 - 104:34)
al's zygarde oh that's cool that's (104:31 - 104:35)
tournament (104:34 - 104:37)
isn't it yeah just leave that as well (104:35 - 104:39)
slide that into a deck (104:37 - 104:42)
i mean are they gonna question it (104:39 - 104:45)
somebody might call a judge on you (104:42 - 104:46)
nobody wants i bet you could get through (104:45 - 104:48)
one match with get through one match (104:46 - 104:50)
at least yeah maybe it gets a really (104:48 - 104:52)
cool rare card i don't remember who the (104:50 - 104:54)
owl trainer was (104:52 - 104:57)
was there an out there's got to be an l (104:54 - 104:59)
in all of there is no one (104:57 - 105:01)
i've done this already there's an isn't (104:59 - 105:02)
there's alder (105:01 - 105:04)

new game there is (105:04 - 105:09)
as far as i know no owl (105:06 - 105:09)
not that i know of i haven't seen (105:10 - 105:14)
because most i mean most of the (105:12 - 105:16)
early games didn't have names on them (105:14 - 105:17)
right i don't think it was (105:16 - 105:19)
gen 3 was it that they actually had (105:17 - 105:21)
names oh yeah (105:19 - 105:24)
yeah they were just like youngster (105:21 - 105:27)
and the names came in the remakes no i (105:24 - 105:29)
think gen 2 had names because (105:27 - 105:30)

call you (105:30 - 105:35)
