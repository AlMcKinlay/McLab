with waking up early to record stuff but (2:17 - 2:22)
when I already have something that's (2:19 - 2:25)
going to keep me up til 4am I'm not so (2:22 - 2:29)

just poked by news because there's (2:53 - 2:56)
actually quite a bit of it and then (2:54 - 2:59)
we'll move on to a couple emails and (2:56 - 3:01)
then we're going to do our pokemon of (2:59 - 3:03)
the week so no dedicated middle topic (3:01 - 3:05)
but i think there are some talking (3:03 - 3:07)
points in this news and we just did a (3:05 - 3:11)
two-hour live show last week which is (3:07 - 3:12)
kind of what I wanted to talk about (3:11 - 3:15)
because we don't do live shows that (3:12 - 3:19)
often and whatnot but let's let's start (3:15 - 3:20)
there what do you what did you guys (3:19 - 3:23)

faces on on the internet and then I took (3:23 - 3:30)
that into took that into post and you (3:27 - 3:32)
know brought down some stuff that might (3:30 - 3:36)
have not been audio only that might not (3:32 - 3:38)
have worked on an audio-only stuff so I (3:36 - 3:40)
took some stuff out I probably cut 20 (3:38 - 3:42)
minutes from the live show into the (3:40 - 3:43)
audio version but overall overall what (3:42 - 3:46)
are you guys his thoughts on on what we (3:43 - 3:49)

assumed as if we do video as if we're a (4:25 - 4:30)
video podcast or something I wasn't (4:28 - 4:32)
prepared the turning on and off the (4:30 - 4:34)

you that stuff before you go to Canada (5:08 - 5:13)
before you get deported because that's (5:10 - 5:17)
not still not funny because I don't want (5:13 - 5:18)
to pay the shipping to Canada there's a (5:17 - 5:20)
significant price difference from (5:18 - 5:22)
[Music] (5:20 - 5:24)
Wisconsin to Michigan than Wisconsin to (5:22 - 5:26)
Canada even though they're correct (5:24 - 5:30)
remotely like the same distance away a (5:26 - 5:33)
little farther up to Winnipeg but sure (5:30 - 5:36)
but where are we on on the the Canadian (5:33 - 5:39)
endeavors same as we were last week (5:36 - 5:42)
waiting for a group of people to decide (5:39 - 5:44)
whether or not the university I went to (5:42 - 5:49)
is reputable all right you know which (5:44 - 5:51)
accreditation agency accredits Sweet (5:49 - 5:55)
Valley College oh I went to Grand Valley (5:51 - 5:59)

even say international credit (6:05 - 6:10)
Association know something it's icas (6:06 - 6:14)

accreditation agency accredits their (6:26 - 6:32)
school hmm I don't kids out there do (6:29 - 6:35)
your research I'm just getting I the (6:32 - 6:37)

ten minutes and I am are just getting (6:37 - 6:42)
lamb basted whether it's the lighting of (6:39 - 6:46)
my room or it's the legitimacy of my (6:42 - 6:50)
bachelor's degree I can't catch a break (6:46 - 6:52)
we haven't even been on for 10 minutes (6:50 - 6:56)
now and I'm feeling so attacked yes that (6:52 - 6:58)
is a great recapitulation of what i feel (6:56 - 7:00)
and said (6:58 - 7:04)
Steve yeah yeah have a good time poor me (7:00 - 7:09)
so back to topic 250 quite a milestone (7:04 - 7:12)
six almost seven years seven years in (7:09 - 7:15)
july 250 episodes i do have some minor (7:12 - 7:18)
changes to the not not so much the form (7:15 - 7:20)
up but how we do the podcast more behind (7:18 - 7:23)
the scenes than actually maybe stuff (7:20 - 7:27)
that might not be noticed offhand (7:23 - 7:29)
recently the last couple episodes we've (7:27 - 7:31)
been trying a different way of recording (7:29 - 7:35)
so it sounds a bit better and a couple (7:31 - 7:38)
people on twitter notice and asked if (7:35 - 7:42)
travis and will got new mics and they (7:38 - 7:44)
they didn't not yet i do plan on getting (7:42 - 7:46)
them even even different mics from the (7:44 - 7:49)
last time we did last time we did a (7:46 - 7:51)
hardware upgrade but just a different (7:49 - 7:53)
way of recording which takes more time (7:51 - 7:56)
to to edit but we're working on that (7:53 - 7:59)
we're working through the kinks so if if (7:56 - 8:03)
you did notice any audio if you didn't (7:59 - 8:06)
notice differences in audio and the last (8:03 - 8:07)
couple episodes we are trying a (8:06 - 8:10)
different different way of doing things (8:07 - 8:13)
so providing any feedback good or bad if (8:10 - 8:16)
you've noticed that yeah i don't i don't (8:13 - 8:20)
know 250 episodes is a big one I is a (8:16 - 8:23)
big milestone and I enjoyed the live (8:20 - 8:26)
episode and it seemed like like the chat (8:23 - 8:28)
really enjoyed the live episode even (8:26 - 8:30)
though we didn't really focus on chat (8:28 - 8:33)
that much but you guys have any is that (8:30 - 8:34)

lets just have to approve all lighting (8:43 - 8:47)
and backgrounds before it occurs I mean (8:45 - 8:49)
she didn't like Steve either so don't (8:47 - 8:51)

incredible success means the 3d esas (11:43 - 11:47)
future is bright I don't really agree (11:45 - 11:50)
with this headline but it's more so this (11:47 - 11:54)
is off polygon it has to do with the UH (11:50 - 11:56)
this was let me get the date right (11:54 - 12:00)
January 31st nintendo announced that it (11:56 - 12:06)
sold 14.6 9 million copies of pokemon (12:00 - 12:09)
sun and moon by the end of 2016 that (12:06 - 12:12)
span was between november 18 through the (12:09 - 12:16)
december 31st so only 44 days which (12:12 - 12:19)
means on average they were selling three (12:16 - 12:20)
hundred and thirty-four thousand copies (12:19 - 12:26)
each day I think it is already outsold x (12:20 - 12:30)
and y and no I outsold Omega Ruby alpha (12:26 - 12:33)
sapphire I think it's on its way to (12:30 - 12:38)
outselling x and y if i'm not mistake (12:33 - 12:42)
more pokemon than they've added i only (12:38 - 12:45)
like the hearse first 150 after that (12:42 - 12:47)
they kind of ran out of ideas am i right (12:45 - 12:55)

quite a bit in this article currently (12:55 - 13:00)

Nintendo said will stick around as a (14:22 - 14:26)

will be on the on the cutting board of (15:12 - 15:21)
the food cutting board of life which (15:17 - 15:25)

out here the game itself is fun the UI (16:43 - 16:49)
is still bad is it does it crash a lot (16:46 - 16:53)
is it slow a sluggish it is slow it is (16:49 - 16:55)
sluggish I don't I haven't had (16:53 - 16:58)
experience with crashes um but a lot of (16:55 - 17:00)
the time if you've suspended the app for (16:58 - 17:02)
a long time and then go back into it it (17:00 - 17:04)
does require that you close out of the (17:02 - 17:06)
app and relaunch it which is unfortunate (17:04 - 17:10)
but the actual playing of the game (17:06 - 17:12)
itself doesn't have to be that sluggish (17:10 - 17:14)
it's generally just navigating through (17:12 - 17:17)
the menus and accepting your login (17:14 - 17:20)
bonuses that can be a hassle but the (17:17 - 17:23)
game itself is fun I heard it's very are (17:20 - 17:24)
and i have not (17:23 - 17:26)
played it yet because i wanted to stream (17:24 - 17:28)
it i heard there were a lot of issues (17:26 - 17:31)
with the slowish in the sluggishness so (17:28 - 17:34)
i haven't opened it yet but i heard that (17:31 - 17:37)
it's very luck based more luck so than (17:34 - 17:40)
the actual like video game competition I (17:37 - 17:43)
mean speak to that yes I would say there (17:40 - 17:48)
is more luck involved than in VGC but I (17:43 - 17:52)
so the way it works is I think I (17:48 - 17:53)
mentioned this before but you've got a (17:52 - 17:58)
grid and you have a set of Pokemon you (17:53 - 18:01)
and each Pokemon has a different number (17:58 - 18:05)
of movement points by which they move (18:01 - 18:07)
the number of movement points is equal (18:05 - 18:08)
to the number of squares that they can (18:07 - 18:11)
move in a turn and the goal is to get to (18:08 - 18:13)
your opponent's goal square which is on (18:11 - 18:15)
the opposite side of the field from you (18:13 - 18:18)
unless your Pokemon has some specific (18:15 - 18:20)
abilities you generally cannot just walk (18:18 - 18:24)
through opponents and need to engage (18:20 - 18:27)
them in combat to defeat them in order (18:24 - 18:29)
to continue on your quest to getting to (18:27 - 18:32)
your opponent's square that combat is (18:29 - 18:36)
completely determined by RNG your (18:32 - 18:38)
Pokemon have essentially a move set and (18:36 - 18:41)
a wheel spins to determine what move you (18:38 - 18:45)
use and same for your opponent and then (18:41 - 18:47)
while there are exceptions like status (18:45 - 18:49)
moose function differently and there are (18:47 - 18:51)
moves with essentially increased (18:49 - 18:54)
priority but other than those extraneous (18:51 - 18:56)
factors generally the Pokemon who rolls (18:54 - 18:58)
the higher number within their moveset (18:56 - 19:01)
wins and the other Pokemon is knocked (18:58 - 19:02)
out so that it's completely random and (19:01 - 19:07)
can be very frustrating but more of the (19:02 - 19:08)
strategy and more of the time you spend (19:07 - 19:11)
playing is is actually in the placement (19:08 - 19:15)
and positioning rather of your pieces so (19:11 - 19:18)
it's less about you're not really even (19:15 - 19:20)
engaging in combat a return and in fact (19:18 - 19:23)
it's more about like making sure your (19:20 - 19:24)
units are placed in such a way that (19:23 - 19:26)
you're defending your base while also (19:24 - 19:28)
having ones that can sort of advance on (19:26 - 19:32)
your opponent's squares and r square (19:28 - 19:35)
rather um and it's really more about (19:32 - 19:37)
where you move your pieces then (19:35 - 19:39)
is about the combat the combat just (19:37 - 19:42)
happens to be how it resolves I guess (19:39 - 19:46)
stalemates in a way hmm it sounds (19:42 - 19:51)
slightly similar to fire emblem minus (19:46 - 19:54)
the Fire Emblem the iOS version minus (19:51 - 19:58)
the whole orangey stuff fire emblem is (19:54 - 20:01)
just like moving your your pieces in a (19:58 - 20:04)
way where you're going to have the (20:01 - 20:06)
biggest advantage and it's the whole (20:04 - 20:09)
green is good against blue blue is good (20:06 - 20:11)
against red red is good against green (20:09 - 20:13)
kind of thing I have never played a fire (20:11 - 20:16)
emblem there well I don't know how (20:13 - 20:18)
different the iOS version is from a main (20:16 - 20:21)
Fire Emblem is there there's no type (20:18 - 20:24)
advantage in duel is there I don't think (20:21 - 20:28)
so there is not okay but there are (20:24 - 20:30)
matchups between Pokemon that are better (20:28 - 20:32)
than others based on abilities and move (20:30 - 20:38)
sets for example latios is a very strong (20:32 - 20:41)
piece so a lot of people will put (20:38 - 20:43)
specific pokemon in their squad that are (20:41 - 20:48)
able to defeat latios that um that have (20:43 - 20:49)
a higher chance of being able to defeat (20:48 - 20:53)
that specific Pokemon so there are their (20:49 - 20:55)
matchups that are more favorable but it (20:53 - 20:58)
doesn't fall on type advantage ya know (20:55 - 21:00)
that's like that's similar in fire (20:58 - 21:02)
emblem where is if you have somebody if (21:00 - 21:04)
you have a unit that is like floaty that (21:02 - 21:08)
is on a Pegasus a flying horse they're (21:04 - 21:10)
more likely to you they can easily be (21:08 - 21:13)
defeated by any of the archer units or (21:10 - 21:17)
if there is like somebody who is wearing (21:13 - 21:19)
armor they only move one space at a time (21:17 - 21:21)
where other pieces can move like for (21:19 - 21:23)
three or four spaces that time but the (21:21 - 21:25)
there are certain units that can like (21:23 - 21:27)
breakthrough are more easily so (21:25 - 21:30)
depending on the matchup you would want (21:27 - 21:32)
to bring in different units they they (21:30 - 21:34)
both like how you're describing duelin (21:32 - 21:35)
again I haven't played it and I've only (21:34 - 21:38)
played a couple hours of the the Fire (21:35 - 21:41)
Emblem iOS game they seem like games (21:38 - 21:44)
that appeal to the same types of players (21:41 - 21:48)
that like that strategy game that just (21:44 - 21:49)
sounds like Pokemon is a little more rng (21:48 - 21:51)
based and of course the theme (21:49 - 21:53)
matters a lot because if you've never (21:51 - 21:56)
played a fire emblem that might not do (21:53 - 21:58)
it for you and of course if you're not (21:56 - 22:01)
into Pokemon why would you ever download (21:58 - 22:03)
pokemon duel but but both those games (22:01 - 22:05)
serve the purpose of you know getting (22:03 - 22:09)
people more involved outside of the (22:05 - 22:12)
series right like that's what pokemon go (22:09 - 22:14)
did really well was and (22:12 - 22:18)
microtransactions right do you have you (22:14 - 22:21)
spent any money in duel no do you know (22:18 - 22:23)
what the price things are off off the (22:21 - 22:25)
bat like what are you buying in duel I'm (22:23 - 22:27)
sure you looked at it there is a second (22:25 - 22:29)
as with many free-to-play games there's (22:27 - 22:34)
a secondary currency called jewels gems (22:29 - 22:36)
jewels and they're called jewels that (22:34 - 22:38)
you you can receive them just naturally (22:36 - 22:41)
through primarily through login bonuses (22:38 - 22:43)
where if you log in every day you get a (22:41 - 22:45)
certain number of jewels and there are a (22:43 - 22:49)
few things that you can buy with Jules I (22:45 - 22:52)
think you can there might be some way of (22:49 - 22:55)
buying figures purely with jewels (22:52 - 22:56)
although I'm not sure about that I (22:55 - 22:58)
haven't seen that particularly the one (22:56 - 23:01)
thing I know that you can use jewels for (22:58 - 23:05)
is to speed up the unlock of your prize (23:01 - 23:07)
chests so the way it works is when you (23:05 - 23:11)
win a match you are rewarded with a (23:07 - 23:16)
booster box and most of the and so the (23:11 - 23:19)
booster boxes you received our time so a (23:16 - 23:21)
rarer one will take a full 24 hours to (23:19 - 23:23)
unlock a common one will take one hour (23:21 - 23:26)
to unlock you can spend gems to open (23:23 - 23:28)
them aamir jewels to open them (23:26 - 23:31)
immediately that's the only thing for (23:28 - 23:34)
sure I know you can spend jewels on but (23:31 - 23:35)
I think there might also be some way to (23:34 - 23:39)
exchange your jewels for material which (23:35 - 23:41)
then you can use to buy specific pieces (23:39 - 23:43)
but there are other ways of generating (23:41 - 23:45)
material as well I have not felt the (23:43 - 23:48)
need to spend any money on it most I (23:45 - 23:51)
mean I don't ever plan on doing it but I (23:48 - 23:52)
really don't have any incentive now (23:51 - 23:54)
because I haven't played the game enough (23:52 - 23:57)
to really know what pieces I should be (23:54 - 23:58)
going for which pieces I should be (23:57 - 24:00)
upgrading because I just don't know that (23:58 - 24:02)
the the meta enough to know if I'm (24:00 - 24:04)
wasting all of my (24:02 - 24:09)
all of my rare rare metal see or my (24:04 - 24:14)
ingot ours or my uh there's also a third (24:09 - 24:17)
one I forget there's a lot of strange (24:14 - 24:21)
currencies and resources that it takes a (24:17 - 24:23)
while to learn the yellow ones you sell (24:21 - 24:25)
for coins the blue ones give you (24:23 - 24:28)
experience the green ones upgrade your (24:25 - 24:30)
sea level and I know I don't know what (24:28 - 24:34)
that is like ocean level no the letter C (24:30 - 24:36)
but I don't see how you would find that (24:34 - 24:40)
misunderstanding well what were you (24:36 - 24:43)
gonna say I wasn't going to say anything (24:40 - 24:47)
except that I have never had any (24:43 - 24:50)
compelling reason to play any fire (24:47 - 24:52)
emblem anything and people have like (24:50 - 24:55)
described the game to me and the more (24:52 - 24:56)
they describe the game to me the less (24:55 - 24:58)
interested I become it just doesn't (24:56 - 25:01)
sound like fun that's the doc that's the (24:58 - 25:04)
Doctor Who effect hey doctor who is (25:01 - 25:07)
greater the morphe I've watched a lot of (25:04 - 25:09)
Doctor Who in my day but you would be (25:07 - 25:11)
lying if you said the more someone talks (25:09 - 25:12)
about Doctor Who the less you want to (25:11 - 25:14)
think about Doctor Who Doctor Who's (25:12 - 25:19)
pretty terrible um what I I couldn't (25:14 - 25:21)
even make has its ups and downs the (25:19 - 25:23)
first episode which was something with a (25:21 - 25:25)
garbage can and like somebody turned (25:23 - 25:28)
into a garbage can or their they came (25:25 - 25:31)
out of a garbage can okay there's we all (25:28 - 25:33)
like different things let's just leave (25:31 - 25:36)
it right there fire emblem I just don't (25:33 - 25:40)
understand so I was a big fan of the (25:36 - 25:42)
advanced War series which is made by the (25:40 - 25:45)
same team that makes fire emblem and I (25:42 - 25:48)
think a lot of my bitterness for the (25:45 - 25:51)
Fire Emblem series despite the fact that (25:48 - 25:54)
Nintendo likes to make a million fire (25:51 - 25:56)
emblems I think there are like beside (25:54 - 25:58)
with this iOS game that just came out (25:56 - 26:00)
there three more Fire Emblem games (25:58 - 26:03)
planned and I feel like we just got a (26:00 - 26:05)
hundred other Fire Emblem games in the (26:03 - 26:06)
last two years well yeah they did the (26:05 - 26:09)
one that was like you could do the one (26:06 - 26:11)
side or the other side and then you (26:09 - 26:13)
could get the third one that was the (26:11 - 26:17)
other side's other side yeah faiths are (26:13 - 26:18)
awake in the end like that (26:17 - 26:20)
for a for fruit game obviously there's (26:18 - 26:24)
besides my time investment there's it's (26:20 - 26:26)
not costing me anything to play and I (26:24 - 26:28)
have played fire emblems in like a long (26:26 - 26:31)
long long long long time ago like when (26:28 - 26:34)
it was super nintendo or wherever it was (26:31 - 26:35)
I can't even remember somebody's gonna (26:34 - 26:37)
write in a very angry email that I don't (26:35 - 26:38)
know I'm talking about that's fine (26:37 - 26:40)
because I don't I just remember I played (26:38 - 26:42)
a really old fireman game and I enjoyed (26:40 - 26:44)
it but I really enjoyed the advanced war (26:42 - 26:47)
series that being said I think Fire (26:44 - 26:49)
Emblem heroes which is the iOS game is (26:47 - 26:53)
really fun and I see why people like it (26:49 - 26:55)
so much and I'll just say this before we (26:53 - 26:58)
move on I think the the big appeal is it (26:55 - 27:00)
has the same appeal of Pokemon of (26:58 - 27:03)
instead of really liking a certain (27:00 - 27:06)
pokemon or certain creatures or you know (27:03 - 27:09)
evolutionary lines you end up really (27:06 - 27:11)
liking certain characters or fighters (27:09 - 27:15)
and that's why somebody like Roy or (27:11 - 27:17)
Marth who are in the smash brothers (27:15 - 27:20)
games are very popular because they're (27:17 - 27:22)
just characters that people can relate (27:20 - 27:24)
to just like people really like (27:22 - 27:28)
vanilluxe or Charizard or Lucario and I (27:24 - 27:30)
don't understand the love of Luke re I (27:28 - 27:32)
do what I actually do understand the (27:30 - 27:34)
lover Lucario but for joking purposes I (27:32 - 27:36)
don't understand the love of Lucario (27:34 - 27:38)
just like I don't understand the love of (27:36 - 27:41)
Mars but those two are the same where (27:38 - 27:44)
people can relate to it in some way and (27:41 - 27:46)
they just end up being favorites so when (27:44 - 27:47)
you're playing fire emblem heroes at (27:46 - 27:49)
least for me somebody who is not into (27:47 - 27:53)
that series it's very easy to start (27:49 - 27:55)
getting these new characters and then (27:53 - 27:58)
instantly starting to like certain (27:55 - 28:00)
characters just based on their outfits (27:58 - 28:01)
or the way they look or all the (28:00 - 28:03)
characters do have a personality where (28:01 - 28:05)
you can click on them and tap them to (28:03 - 28:07)
make them say something and the two or (28:05 - 28:11)
three lines of dialogue the two or three (28:07 - 28:13)
lines of dialogue they say is very easy (28:11 - 28:15)
to get a feel of what kind of (28:13 - 28:17)
personality they have which then plays (28:15 - 28:20)
in part of why you might find yourself (28:17 - 28:23)
liking that character more and just like (28:20 - 28:26)
in Pokemon you have all these characters (28:23 - 28:29)
at your disposal but you pick for to go (28:26 - 28:31)
into battle with you at a time and then (28:29 - 28:32)
you level up (28:31 - 28:34)
and they learn new moves and stuff so it (28:32 - 28:40)
it it does fit this it does fit in a way (28:34 - 28:43)
that Pokemon fits in a way of those two (28:40 - 28:46)
audiences crossing over with each other (28:43 - 28:50)
it's like in a kitchen if you take a cup (28:46 - 28:55)
of milk and a bottle of chocolate syrup (28:50 - 28:58)
and you mix it together those cross over (28:55 - 29:01)
into each other just like I'm done with (28:58 - 29:03)
these food analogies what else do we (29:01 - 29:04)
have for now it's like are you sending (29:03 - 29:07)
secret messages to some foreign spy (29:04 - 29:10)
Confederacy with these batteries charged (29:07 - 29:13)
middle just get activated valentine's (29:10 - 29:16)
Day is coming up and Pokemon Center has (29:13 - 29:20)
updated their their lineup of (29:16 - 29:22)
merchandise I don't know why this is (29:20 - 29:26)
news but I think sometimes we forget (29:22 - 29:28)
that Pokemon Center exists and they do (29:26 - 29:30)
add a lot of stuff but for valentine's (29:28 - 29:34)
day there is a a slowpoke shirt there (29:30 - 29:37)
are SPN and Umbreon coffee mugs and i (29:34 - 29:39)
know those are two very popular Pokemon (29:37 - 29:44)
there are some Valentine's Day heart / (29:39 - 29:46)
note cards with envelopes and then there (29:44 - 29:50)
is a five pack pin set that you can get (29:46 - 29:53)
which features Pikachu Evie umbreon s (29:50 - 29:56)
pre espy on and slow poke so those are (29:53 - 29:58)
all in the Pokemon Center the other bit (29:56 - 29:59)
of news I wanted to piggyback off that (29:58 - 30:03)
is they are adding plushies from Sun and (29:59 - 30:05)
Moon to Pokemon Center I'm sure a lot of (30:03 - 30:07)
listeners or just Pokemon fans in (30:05 - 30:09)
general or waiting for a mimic you plush (30:07 - 30:11)
which I don't think exists yeah I know (30:09 - 30:13)
it exists but it doesn't exist in the (30:11 - 30:15)
English Pokemon Center but they did just (30:13 - 30:19)
add kamala togi Dimauro rock rough and (30:15 - 30:23)
pika peck in plush form in the Pokemon (30:19 - 30:26)
Center so I know that that is that is (30:23 - 30:28)
exciting in itself because I think those (30:26 - 30:31)
pokemon are great and I think Pokemon (30:28 - 30:34)
Center is great and it is good if you if (30:31 - 30:37)
money's no good in the bank so if you (30:34 - 30:39)
need to find a way to dispose of it (30:37 - 30:43)
Pokemon Center is a good outlet for that (30:39 - 30:46)
other better news here is the Pokemon (30:43 - 30:49)
advanced complete collection is going to (30:46 - 30:51)
be released in north america speaking of (30:49 - 30:55)

I think it has a different name but I'm (33:45 - 33:49)
not gonna look it up for you all right (33:47 - 33:55)
good it is the Paleozoic Pokemon really (33:49 - 33:58)
it's a more appropriate that doesn't (33:55 - 34:01)
sound is interested in diving jetta sec (33:58 - 34:05)
school and has a good look good theme ah (34:01 - 34:08)
that's that's all i have for news i (34:05 - 34:09)
don't know if i'm missing anything i (34:08 - 34:10)
believe there was a pokemon go update (34:09 - 34:13)
and it made some fixes for apple watch (34:10 - 34:16)
but i have not tried it yet so we I'm (34:14 - 34:19)
being a recent owner of an Apple watch (34:16 - 34:22)
as opposed to last weekend you said you (34:19 - 34:25)
don't have the series to right correct i (34:22 - 34:27)
have series 1 which is different than (34:25 - 34:31)
series 0 which was the original apple (34:27 - 34:33)
watch and but yours doesn't have GPS (34:31 - 34:35)
built in right correct mine doesn't have (34:33 - 34:37)
GPS and it doesn't have the (34:35 - 34:39)
waterproofing but i don't know how to (34:37 - 34:42)
swim so i didn't need the waterproofing (34:39 - 34:44)
also i didn't find the gps to be that (34:42 - 34:47)
beneficial because i can never imagine (34:44 - 34:50)
going outside my house for a run without (34:47 - 34:52)
my phone because what i can imagine that (34:50 - 34:55)
but um so my question is possibly all of (34:52 - 34:59)
the issues you were having were because (34:55 - 35:02)
of the lack of GPS so I've got to give (34:59 - 35:04)
it a try since I've got the I've got the (35:02 - 35:06)
series to know it has nothing to do with (35:04 - 35:08)
sufficient it has to do with the fact (35:06 - 35:10)
that the app would crash after 20 (35:08 - 35:13)
seconds because behind because crashing (35:10 - 35:15)
as it was trying to access a GPS no (35:13 - 35:17)
because it pulls off your phone though (35:15 - 35:19)
the only difference between the GPS and (35:17 - 35:22)
the watch and the GPS without the watch (35:19 - 35:27)
is it pulls from your phone's GPS and (35:22 - 35:28)
let me tell you my phone's GPS is fine (35:27 - 35:30)
you have it used to also also always (35:28 - 35:32)
complain about delete getting delays in (35:30 - 35:34)
getting notifications for things and (35:32 - 35:35)
I've never had that problem either I've (35:34 - 35:37)
never had that problem will you talk (35:35 - 35:39)
about somebody used to complain about (35:37 - 35:42)
that check your Twitter history all (35:39 - 35:45)
right give you an update out of my 74 (35:42 - 35:48)

couple emails go through and our poke (37:02 - 37:08)
amount of the week I do really like the (37:05 - 37:09)
email segment so I wanted to make sure (37:08 - 37:12)
that we try to at least do a handful (37:09 - 37:14)
especially since I have such a backlog (37:12 - 37:16)
of emails but if you want to email us (37:14 - 37:19)

email is from matt from webster (37:37 - 37:44)
matchy-matchy xuxa seeeeee massachusetts (37:40 - 37:47)
hey guys I love the show and listen (37:44 - 37:49)
every week usually with my girlfriend (37:47 - 37:52)
who finds the show hilarious with banter (37:49 - 37:55)
my question that i have is looking to do (37:52 - 37:58)
a podcast about magic the gathering (37:55 - 38:00)
lower and i was wondering how you (37:58 - 38:02)
managed the time to do everything in the (38:00 - 38:05)
podcast and everything related to it and (38:02 - 38:07)
any advice you could all give me i'm a (38:05 - 38:09)
huge fan of the host but wills will (38:07 - 38:13)
shines above the rest in my house even (38:09 - 38:15)
with my six year olds laughs at the (38:13 - 38:17)
sarcasm he adds thank you for your hard (38:15 - 38:19)
work and entertainment my favorite (38:17 - 38:22)
pokemon is Umbreon without a doubt i (38:19 - 38:24)
would a pokemon center has some stuff (38:22 - 38:27)
for you also good luck to Travis with (38:24 - 38:31)
their Canadian move thanks the thing (38:27 - 38:34)
about will sarcasm I appreciate the luck (38:31 - 38:36)
wishes the thing about will sarcasm is (38:34 - 38:38)
that when he dragged me through the dirt (38:36 - 38:43)
he's not being sarcastic I'm a very (38:38 - 38:46)
disappointed aunty I can only be as I am (38:43 - 38:49)
you you both have other podcasts which (38:46 - 38:53)
rack which you should pit pimp ugh so go (38:49 - 38:55)
ahead pimp your pimp your podcast and (38:53 - 38:57)
then you know give me give me what you (38:55 - 39:00)
do to maybe prepare or just set that (38:57 - 39:03)
show up well Travis you go first because (39:00 - 39:06)
yours is much less niche than my (39:03 - 39:10)
okay yeah I do a show called arbitrary (39:06 - 39:13)
archive it's a culture of you show we (39:10 - 39:16)
take a random well in the fiction we (39:13 - 39:19)
receive a thematic suggestion from a (39:16 - 39:21)
sentient AI named Jeff but in reality (39:19 - 39:23)
we're just taking a random word (39:21 - 39:25)
generator and then using that random (39:23 - 39:27)
word as our theme for the following week (39:25 - 39:30)
were like for example this upcoming (39:27 - 39:32)
episode the word that was randomly (39:30 - 39:34)
generated was demolish meant so we both (39:32 - 39:36)
had to pick a piece of media that fit (39:34 - 39:38)
within that category and then we talked (39:36 - 39:41)
about why it's worthwhile or not (39:38 - 39:43)
worthwhile and we do that every week the (39:41 - 39:46)
thing that I came down to with the (39:43 - 39:48)
process with that show is because unlike (39:46 - 39:49)
it's super effective where there's a (39:48 - 39:51)
sense in which we're covering news or (39:49 - 39:56)
any like breaking content the keys to (39:51 - 39:58)
just record in advance right so it (39:56 - 40:01)
doesn't matter when we recorded the show (39:58 - 40:03)
for arbitrary archive because the (40:01 - 40:05)
content is the same regardless of (40:03 - 40:07)
whether we recorded at a week ago or not (40:05 - 40:09)
so generally it's actually not true of (40:07 - 40:12)
right now but generally our process is (40:09 - 40:16)
to have at least one episode recorded in (40:12 - 40:19)
advance so if something comes up we only (40:16 - 40:22)
need to edit and instead of having to (40:19 - 40:24)
add a and record in case we get busy and (40:22 - 40:26)
I think that really helps with being (40:24 - 40:29)
able to fit your release schedule and be (40:26 - 40:31)
consistent with it not that we've been (40:29 - 40:33)
perfectly consistent but you know we (40:31 - 40:36)
haven't we've only missed one week I (40:33 - 40:39)
think and and I think that's the key (40:36 - 40:42)
right is to have that sort of buffer (40:39 - 40:43)
there and it sounds like if you're just (40:42 - 40:45)
covering magic lord that it would be a (40:43 - 40:47)
similar circumstance for you that you (40:45 - 40:50)
wouldn't necessarily need to be covering (40:47 - 40:52)
the latest magic the gathering news (40:50 - 40:53)
because that's not your subject matter (40:52 - 40:55)
so that would be my suggestion are you (40:53 - 40:58)
sure they don't want the latest magic (40:55 - 40:59)
the gathering news as part of the (40:58 - 41:02)
program well I mean the email writer (40:59 - 41:03)
said they're covering lower so that we (41:02 - 41:05)
don't like storing information and lore (41:03 - 41:08)
and like this stuff about a like Jase I (41:05 - 41:10)
think is a magic the gathering character (41:08 - 41:15)
or the one like angel or lack notice (41:10 - 41:18)
that is a magic the guidance Black Lotus (41:15 - 41:20)
that's a that's a thing in magic (41:18 - 41:20)
together (41:20 - 41:22)
the probably the problem with your (41:20 - 41:25)
argument is that as they come out with (41:22 - 41:28)
new cards that adds to the lore so (41:25 - 41:31)
they'll want to discuss those cards and (41:28 - 41:33)
sure my reason I mean they even then (41:31 - 41:36)
that's that's not happening every week (41:33 - 41:38)
so you know you might sometime need to (41:36 - 41:42)
have an episode like well I'm even then (41:38 - 41:45)
okay so you might need to have have an (41:42 - 41:47)
episode that's current if they just (41:45 - 41:49)
announced all of the new cards for the (41:47 - 41:50)
new set and then you want to talk about (41:49 - 41:53)
them or whatever but you could also have (41:50 - 41:57)
a few episodes recorded unlike lore from (41:53 - 42:02)
purses legacy and it doesn't matter when (41:57 - 42:03)
you recorded that because it's already (42:02 - 42:07)
old well that's true I I don't have (42:03 - 42:14)
Steve I don't know the the podcast space (42:07 - 42:17)
that involves magic the gathering but I (42:14 - 42:19)
would assume that a lot of podcast in (42:17 - 42:21)
that space are probably about the (42:19 - 42:23)
metagame and the most recent stuff so I (42:21 - 42:26)
would assume that there aren't a lot of (42:23 - 42:29)
podcasts specifically about the lore so (42:26 - 42:32)
if that is the case i feel like matt has (42:29 - 42:35)
a slight advantage and that's something (42:32 - 42:38)
that it's super effective had the (42:35 - 42:41)
advantage in back in back when we (42:38 - 42:44)
started and and something that will spot (42:41 - 42:46)
cast drive check has an advantage in (42:44 - 42:49)
because that market wasn't at the time (42:46 - 42:50)
when it's super effective started that (42:49 - 42:53)
market wasn't saturated yet which is (42:50 - 42:56)
which is kind of my advice which is let (42:53 - 42:58)
me let me explain a bit I might have (42:56 - 43:00)
explained this before but just to like (42:58 - 43:03)
recap before it's super effective I had (43:00 - 43:07)
a video game only podcast because at the (43:03 - 43:11)
time I only listen to video game podcast (43:07 - 43:13)
like general video game podcast where (43:11 - 43:15)
they talk about everything what's new (43:13 - 43:17)
coming up what they're playing and what (43:15 - 43:21)
not and that space is extremely crowded (43:17 - 43:24)
it's very hard to stand up just like (43:21 - 43:26)
it's very hard to stand out as like a (43:24 - 43:28)
twitch streamer or YouTube streamer the (43:26 - 43:32)
same thing in podcast and I (43:28 - 43:36)
it's it's harder nowadays than it was (43:32 - 43:40)
back in you know 2010 we're not a lot of (43:36 - 43:44)
people knew what podcasts were I wasn't (43:40 - 43:47)
satisfied with the game coverage with (43:44 - 43:50)
the game the generalized game coverage (43:47 - 43:52)
kind of skipping pokemon that's when I (43:50 - 43:56)
went out and I sought to find a podcast (43:52 - 43:57)
that would talk about Pokemon which (43:56 - 44:00)
ended up being not a lot of podcasts and (43:57 - 44:01)
I've said there were there were Pokemon (44:00 - 44:04)
specific podcast of the time but they (44:01 - 44:05)
were either on hiatus or they weren't (44:04 - 44:06)
burning out they weren't putting out (44:05 - 44:09)
weekly episodes or whatnot and that's (44:06 - 44:11)
when I decided to make my own show and (44:09 - 44:15)
that really fit that void of okay no one (44:11 - 44:17)
else is really doing this and even (44:15 - 44:19)
though I'm not doing it very well and I (44:17 - 44:23)
can assure you the first you know dozens (44:19 - 44:25)
of episodes of its super fective were (44:23 - 44:28)
bad they were not good ah but I was (44:25 - 44:31)
doing it weekly and I was trying to do (44:28 - 44:33)
something that no one else was (44:31 - 44:37)
consistently at the time like I said (44:33 - 44:38)
there were other Pokemon podcast but (44:37 - 44:40)
might the key word i was using there is (44:38 - 44:42)
consistency and so that's kind of my (44:40 - 44:45)
advice is if there are no other magic (44:42 - 44:48)
the gathering lower podcast then you're (44:45 - 44:50)
already in or you're already in a good (44:48 - 44:53)
place the the second key to that (44:50 - 44:55)
equation is to do that consistently and (44:53 - 44:59)
I a lot of people can look at a list of (44:55 - 45:01)
podcast and go oh this podcast only have (44:59 - 45:03)
has like 10 episodes 10 episodes is a (45:01 - 45:06)
lot like 10 episodes is over two months (45:03 - 45:08)
of content if you're doing it weekly and (45:06 - 45:10)
you should and you should make sure you (45:08 - 45:13)
hit a schedule it wasn't it's not until (45:10 - 45:16)
you have a good listener ship under your (45:13 - 45:19)
belts and and good as good as relative (45:16 - 45:21)
to what you want to achieve if a good (45:19 - 45:22)
listener ship to you is a hundred people (45:21 - 45:24)
listening a week that's awesome if a (45:22 - 45:26)
good listener ship to you as a thousand (45:24 - 45:28)
people listening the week that that that (45:26 - 45:30)
metric is just up to you and what you (45:28 - 45:33)
you want to get out of it but once you (45:30 - 45:35)
feel like you have it you have a good (45:33 - 45:37)
number if you have a good listener ship (45:35 - 45:40)
that's when you can you know take a week (45:37 - 45:43)
off because it's Christmas or delay an (45:40 - 45:45)
episode of day because you know you're (45:43 - 45:46)
you're just sick and you can't (45:45 - 45:49)
bed but i think it is what to piggyback (45:46 - 45:52)
off what Travis said maybe record one or (45:49 - 45:54)
two episodes in advance in case you're (45:52 - 45:57)
sick in case an emergency comes up in (45:54 - 46:00)
case you're you're swamped at work (45:57 - 46:03)
because consistency in the podcast field (46:00 - 46:07)
is really important and I think being (46:03 - 46:09)
different is also really important you (46:07 - 46:11)
could go out right now and start a (46:09 - 46:14)
Nintendo podcast but I don't know how (46:11 - 46:16)
that podcast is going to be different (46:14 - 46:18)
than other Nintendo podcasts that have (46:16 - 46:20)
already been doing it that have proven (46:18 - 46:23)
and had a track record of consistency an (46:20 - 46:25)
established audience base you gotta (46:23 - 46:28)
remember that people only have a (46:25 - 46:30)
specific amount of time in a week to (46:28 - 46:33)
listen to shows and as much as I love (46:30 - 46:35)
podcasts I have cut a lot of podcasts (46:33 - 46:38)
out of my life just because I didn't (46:35 - 46:40)
like one of the hosts and maybe that's (46:38 - 46:41)
why a lot of people who listen to the (46:40 - 46:43)
superfecta visitor like I can't stand (46:41 - 46:47)
Steve but um and I say I don't like one (46:43 - 46:49)
of the hosts and I mean that because if (46:47 - 46:51)
I don't like one of the hosts or I don't (46:49 - 46:54)
like one of the personalities I can find (46:51 - 46:56)
another podcast that talks about that (46:54 - 46:59)
topic that I do like the hosts on and (46:56 - 47:00)
that's what I mean when I say that but (46:59 - 47:04)
yeah so find finally finding or doing (47:00 - 47:06)
something that stands out than other (47:04 - 47:08)
shows does help there was a time where I (47:06 - 47:11)
thought about doing a splatoon podcast (47:08 - 47:13)
because I did believe that there was (47:11 - 47:17)
enough information and community there (47:13 - 47:21)
to do that weekly and even with splatoon (47:17 - 47:23)
like not doing there like they're there (47:21 - 47:26)
mending their their monthly events or (47:23 - 47:28)
stop releasing weapons every week I do (47:26 - 47:32)
think that there was a good five or six (47:28 - 47:34)
months where I could have done a split (47:32 - 47:36)
splatoon podcast which is about like 25 (47:34 - 47:38)
30 episodes and it probably would have (47:36 - 47:39)
done pretty well because that community (47:38 - 47:41)
in itself is pretty active i'm sure the (47:39 - 47:43)
Magic the Gathering community for lower (47:41 - 47:45)
is pretty active so I think you have (47:43 - 47:47)
something there but like look what's (47:45 - 47:49)
what's not being done and try to fill (47:47 - 47:51)
that void and if that's the case for you (47:49 - 47:53)
then you're on a good start but just (47:51 - 47:55)
like Travis said I think consistency is (47:53 - 47:58)
a big part I gave you a really long (47:55 - 48:00)
answers all that will talk now (47:58 - 48:03)
well so you know drive check is also (48:00 - 48:06)
about a collectible card game so in some (48:03 - 48:09)
ways I can relate in there is a ton of (48:06 - 48:12)
lore in cardfight Vanguard you know (48:09 - 48:14)
primarily because it derives first off (48:12 - 48:18)
from somebody who wanted it to be like (48:14 - 48:21)
manga and anime so it has all those (48:18 - 48:23)
tropes built into the actual game and (48:21 - 48:26)
then there's an actual manga and an (48:23 - 48:27)
actual anime that go along with the card (48:26 - 48:29)
game but the three things i would add on (48:27 - 48:33)
to what Steven Travis said are if if you (48:29 - 48:37)
want to do a podcast it is not a one (48:33 - 48:41)
night a week thing you're probably going (48:37 - 48:43)
to need to dedicate at least a portion (48:41 - 48:46)
of three nights a week number one figure (48:43 - 48:47)
out what you're going to be talking (48:46 - 48:49)
about when you actually do record and (48:47 - 48:51)
document that you want you know for a (48:49 - 48:54)
drive check we do a what we call the (48:51 - 48:56)
program notes every week where we put (48:54 - 48:58)
together the actual topics that we're (48:56 - 49:00)
going to be talking about so that when (48:58 - 49:02)
everybody gets together we all know what (49:00 - 49:03)
we're actually going to be talking about (49:02 - 49:05)
and then if any of those require (49:03 - 49:07)
research and if you are doing a lower (49:05 - 49:09)
podcast you probably want to do some (49:07 - 49:11)
research into the background of where (49:09 - 49:13)
things come from people can take the (49:11 - 49:16)
time to do that research then you need a (49:13 - 49:18)
night where you're actually going to (49:16 - 49:21)
record and if you're recording like if (49:18 - 49:23)
your goal is to say record half an hour (49:21 - 49:27)
to 45 minutes then you know always (49:23 - 49:29)
double the amount of time that you're (49:27 - 49:31)
planning especially when you're first (49:29 - 49:33)
starting out because it just takes that (49:31 - 49:35)
time especially if you're recording with (49:33 - 49:38)
people in different locations across the (49:35 - 49:41)
country to get the people all in the (49:38 - 49:43)
same place at the same time and up and (49:41 - 49:46)
ready to record and prepared and (49:43 - 49:48)
everything like that and then your third (49:46 - 49:51)
night is actually editing what you (49:48 - 49:55)
record which really involves listening (49:51 - 49:59)
to what you recorded over again not sped (49:55 - 50:02)
up and actually catching anything that (49:59 - 50:05)
needs to be cut out any silences that go (50:02 - 50:08)
on for too long if there's some clicking (50:05 - 50:09)
in the background that you need to cut (50:08 - 50:11)
out anything like that and then if you (50:09 - 50:13)
want to add any audio effects (50:11 - 50:15)
that's the time when you do that so you (50:13 - 50:18)
know like recently in drive check there (50:15 - 50:21)
were two card games that have died so i (50:18 - 50:23)
added in you know a trumpet playing taps (50:21 - 50:25)
as we were discussing those card games (50:23 - 50:28)
dying but you know i had to find that (50:25 - 50:31)
audio file and integrated into the (50:28 - 50:33)
recording and make sure that that just (50:31 - 50:35)
asked me i play the trumpet i did not (50:33 - 50:38)
know that you know playtex i need next (50:35 - 50:40)
time I need a recording of taps I will (50:38 - 50:43)
ask you to submit also but yet but then (50:40 - 50:45)
you have to adjust the audio levels for (50:43 - 50:46)
that recording make sure that's not (50:45 - 50:49)
overpowering the voices and everything (50:46 - 50:50)
and then of course you know if you are (50:49 - 50:54)
doing people who are recording over (50:50 - 50:56)
skype then you've got multiple tracks to (50:54 - 50:59)
manage and you have to have an audio (50:56 - 51:04)
editing software package that you use or (50:59 - 51:08)
two or three I wait I only use two at (51:04 - 51:10)
this point in time but yeah I mean it's (51:08 - 51:13)
you're gonna it takes time right it's (51:10 - 51:15)
not oh my buddies are gonna sit down for (51:13 - 51:17)
half an hour a week and we're just gonna (51:15 - 51:18)
plop that on the internet because you (51:17 - 51:20)
guess what nobody's gonna listen to that (51:18 - 51:23)
also get good microphones yeah dad don't (51:20 - 51:25)
don't skip on the microphones absolutely (51:23 - 51:30)
the your iphone headphones microphone no (51:25 - 51:33)
bueno don't don't go down that path so (51:30 - 51:37)
yeah just you know be prepared to make a (51:33 - 51:38)
time commitment and then when you (51:37 - 51:40)
combine that time commitment with (51:38 - 51:44)
consistency boy it becomes actual work (51:40 - 51:50)
so be prepared yeah the work of it the (51:44 - 51:53)
last thing I'll say which will validate (51:50 - 51:55)
will which might be a what might be a (51:53 - 51:59)
first on the show is the time know which (51:55 - 52:02)
is the time thing I think for it's super (51:59 - 52:04)
effective there there is that exception (52:02 - 52:06)
because we've been doing this for so (52:04 - 52:08)
long with so Travis and will and no (52:06 - 52:11)
offense to you guys but you guys do (52:08 - 52:13)
little to no work besides showing up (52:11 - 52:16)
correct that is very true and so you (52:13 - 52:20)
show up I I lay out the ILA at the game (52:16 - 52:23)
plan and and we go we normally do that (52:20 - 52:26)
sunday morning and then I I'll actually (52:23 - 52:27)
edit it (52:26 - 52:30)
at night before I go to bed on Sunday I (52:27 - 52:32)
usually wait till Irene goes to bed I (52:30 - 52:34)
edit it and then I go to bed and then (52:32 - 52:36)
that way when I wake up it's hit all the (52:34 - 52:38)
RSS feeds and it's it's out first thing (52:36 - 52:41)
on Monday that's that's the rhythm there (52:38 - 52:45)
but with with the tuesday night podcast (52:41 - 52:47)
which is my board gaming podcast if you (52:45 - 52:50)
were to ask me over a year ago if doing (52:47 - 52:52)
a podcast was easy i probably would have (52:50 - 52:56)
said yes because I'm so used to Travis (52:52 - 52:58)
and will and I'm so used to the rhythm (52:56 - 53:01)
that we we've come to and I think we see (52:58 - 53:03)
that a lot in reviews and comments of (53:01 - 53:05)
people saying that we sound just like (53:03 - 53:08)
like friends in reality when we're not (53:05 - 53:12)
friends we hate each other so true so (53:08 - 53:15)
true but no we do have we do have this (53:12 - 53:18)
chemistry and that that didn't that (53:15 - 53:21)
wasn't apparent 150 episodes ago why (53:18 - 53:23)
bring up the tuesday night podcast is (53:21 - 53:24)
because i was doing I was hosting (53:23 - 53:27)
another podcast which I would have told (53:24 - 53:29)
you I've done that I've done i have two (53:27 - 53:30)
hundred fifty episodes under my belt I (53:29 - 53:32)
know how to host the podcast but doing (53:30 - 53:35)
that with like two new people that you (53:32 - 53:37)
know aren't familiar with podcasts but (53:35 - 53:39)
aren't familiar in like doing podcasts (53:37 - 53:42)
but are very good talkers and they can (53:39 - 53:45)
talk that that's for sure I I just felt (53:42 - 53:48)
like I wasn't achieving what I was (53:45 - 53:50)
achieving so easily with it's super (53:48 - 53:52)
effective and it was something that (53:50 - 53:53)
Brent me out and something that I've had (53:52 - 53:55)
a conversation with Sean and Alan about (53:53 - 53:57)
of like hey I loved doing the show but (53:55 - 54:00)
like this show is taking up too much (53:57 - 54:02)
time and I'm feeling burnt out and I (54:00 - 54:03)
don't even have time to play board games (54:02 - 54:06)
and no offense to you guys but like (54:03 - 54:07)
doing it's super effective is my (54:06 - 54:10)
priority it is like my baby of a podcast (54:07 - 54:12)
and I have to make sure that I have the (54:10 - 54:13)
energy to do that show and they were (54:12 - 54:16)
completely on your understanding and (54:13 - 54:18)
I've stepped away from that show now for (54:16 - 54:21)
for a little bit and I think that show (54:18 - 54:23)
is in a good place and I think Alan and (54:21 - 54:27)
Sean will handle that show well as I'm (54:23 - 54:32)
away yeah it's it I you know I did 60 60 (54:27 - 54:33)
some episodes of the tuesday night (54:32 - 54:34)
podcast and that's a lot that's like a (54:33 - 54:37)
that's a year straight and honestly I (54:34 - 54:39)
felt burnt out I felt like I can't do (54:37 - 54:41)
this again (54:39 - 54:44)
and and that that's still my show and (54:41 - 54:46)
that's still something that like I care (54:44 - 54:49)
about but I will eventually go back to (54:46 - 54:51)
that but I don't know what my original (54:49 - 54:53)
point is I think my original point was (54:51 - 54:55)
like podcasting is a lot more work than (54:53 - 54:57)
it just seems on paper it's it's l it's (54:55 - 54:58)
a lot more than three people sitting (54:57 - 55:00)
around and talking and that's not to say (54:58 - 55:02)
it's bad like if you want podcast go go (55:00 - 55:06)
podcast but it's it's not a it it's not (55:02 - 55:10)
free it's not it's not oh oh oh wait (55:06 - 55:11)
wait thank you for bringing that up it (55:10 - 55:14)
is not free you gotta pay that (55:11 - 55:16)
soundcloud monthly fee you're gonna have (55:14 - 55:19)
our very or Lisbon or wherever you (55:16 - 55:21)
decide to go by that we all do (55:19 - 55:24)
soundcloud uh you you want a website for (55:21 - 55:25)
your podcast you're paying the (55:24 - 55:30)
squarespace dudes ain't free and can I (55:25 - 55:32)
can I offer one more piece of advice (55:30 - 55:37)
yeah be very trepidatious if your (55:32 - 55:39)
co-hosts are going to be college (55:37 - 55:42)
students because college students who (55:39 - 55:46)
are in classes lack two things one a (55:42 - 55:49)
consistent schedule because even if you (55:46 - 55:51)
know what their class schedule is they (55:49 - 55:53)
might have a lot of homework to do that (55:51 - 55:54)
night that you were planning to record (55:53 - 55:57)
and all of a sudden there are no longer (55:54 - 56:00)
available to record and two college (55:57 - 56:02)
students don't have a lot of privacy so (56:00 - 56:06)
it's hard for them to have a quiet room (56:02 - 56:08)
to themselves where they won't have some (56:06 - 56:11)
other person walk in the room and start (56:08 - 56:13)
talking to them and they're like dude (56:11 - 56:16)
I'm recording and you like huh one more (56:13 - 56:19)
thing to edit out when I was in college (56:16 - 56:23)
and a part of the show I would go to (56:19 - 56:28)
like an abandoned wing of the of the (56:23 - 56:32)
housing building that I lived in and (56:28 - 56:35)
found just a very dark vacant room and (56:32 - 56:38)
would record from there I remember that (56:35 - 56:40)
remember that and then occasionally (56:38 - 56:42)
people would run by like playing hide (56:40 - 56:45)
and seek after they wandered into the (56:42 - 56:47)
the darkness that was that part of the (56:45 - 56:48)
building and that would ruin things but (56:47 - 56:52)
yeah it is it is a that is a concern (56:48 - 56:54)
make sure you have a place to record (56:52 - 56:58)
that is nice and and I would also (56:54 - 57:01)
mention that (56:58 - 57:05)
eventually you're going to figure out (57:01 - 57:08)
your and this is I mean I realized that (57:05 - 57:09)
question asker was asking mostly how to (57:08 - 57:11)
find the time to be able to do the show (57:09 - 57:13)
but we've sort of transitioned into just (57:11 - 57:16)
giving general advice I would say also (57:13 - 57:19)
eventually I think you'll find and your (57:16 - 57:21)
co-hosts if you have them will find (57:19 - 57:27)
their what their podcast persona or or (57:21 - 57:30)
voice is and I think it's okay to lean (57:27 - 57:32)
into that I certainly have a different (57:30 - 57:34)
personality on this show than I do in (57:32 - 57:36)
person it's sort of an exaggerated (57:34 - 57:39)
version of me I think that's important (57:36 - 57:40)
to do because you're supposed to be (57:39 - 57:41)
entertaining people and I think it's (57:40 - 57:44)
okay to be a little outrageous if that (57:41 - 57:45)
is the tonality of your show because at (57:44 - 57:47)
first you might think no I want to be (57:45 - 57:50)
the genuine real me sometimes and I mean (57:47 - 57:51)
this is me included people are kind of (57:50 - 57:53)
boring so it's okay to be a bit of a (57:51 - 57:55)
cartoon character if you need to be one (57:53 - 57:57)
hundred percent agree if your real-life (57:55 - 58:02)
personality is a stake and your podcast (57:57 - 58:05)
personality is on the cutting board of a (58:02 - 58:09)
salted steak and you grill that for an (58:05 - 58:12)
hour and 45 minutes you have yourself (58:09 - 58:15)
one heck of a podcast but thank you Matt (58:12 - 58:16)
for writing in that was a very (58:15 - 58:19)
long-winded answer second question (58:16 - 58:23)
second email here is from derek from los (58:19 - 58:25)
angeles california hey SBJ and the rest (58:23 - 58:27)
of the Pokemon crew I've been meaning to (58:25 - 58:30)
email you for a long time now but as (58:27 - 58:31)
with many things in life I haven't (58:30 - 58:33)
seemed to have the time to sit down and (58:31 - 58:35)
send an email after just listening to (58:33 - 58:38)
the 250th episode special I felt (58:35 - 58:39)
inspired to sit down and send in this (58:38 - 58:42)
email first off I wanted to say thank (58:39 - 58:43)
you for regularly putting out a high (58:42 - 58:47)
quality entertaining podcast I am 27 (58:43 - 58:49)
years old and some of the best childhood (58:47 - 58:50)
memories revolve around playing the (58:49 - 58:53)
first two generations of Pokemon games I (58:50 - 58:55)
took a decade and a half hiatus from (58:53 - 58:59)
Pokemon this ended on pokemon Day 2016 (58:55 - 59:02)
why when I felt inspired to go out to a (58:59 - 59:04)
local gamestop and pick up a 2d s that I (59:02 - 59:06)
could download and play through pokemon (59:04 - 59:08)
red again after flying through the game (59:06 - 59:10)
I decided I wanted to go back and play (59:08 - 59:12)
through all the different generations (59:10 - 59:14)
that I missed I guess that once you hit (59:12 - 59:15)
your (59:14 - 59:16)
once you hit your mid-20s you no longer (59:15 - 59:20)
care playing pokemon is cool anymore we (59:16 - 59:22)
have this a lot and I've expressed my (59:20 - 59:26)
same opinions for that in the year that (59:22 - 59:28)
has passed since Pokemon Day 2016 I've (59:26 - 59:30)
picked up and played through heartgold (59:28 - 59:33)
alpha sapphire X and both Sun and Moon (59:30 - 59:34)
most of these have played through two or (59:33 - 59:36)
three times your podcast has helped me (59:34 - 59:39)
fill huge gaps in my pokemon knowledge (59:36 - 59:42)
as well as inspired me to reach into the (59:39 - 59:45)
Pokemon back catalog and experience all (59:42 - 59:47)
these games for the first time I'm at a (59:45 - 59:49)
point now where it isn't a weekly (59:47 - 59:51)
episode I'm at a point now where there (59:49 - 59:53)
isn't a weekly episode that comes out (59:51 - 59:55)
that I don't listen to I teach middle (59:53 - 59:57)
school and Pokemon is an awesome way for (59:55 - 59:59)
me to connect with my students also my (59:57 - 60:03)
goal for 2017 is to have played through (59:59 - 60:05)
every main series Pokemon game which (60:03 - 60:07)
means I have some awesome new first (60:05 - 60:10)
ahead of me SBJ there's something you (60:07 - 60:12)
said during the 2015 special episode (60:10 - 60:14)
live episode that struck a chord with me (60:12 - 60:16)
you mentioned that will and Travis (60:14 - 60:18)
always tend to be fan favorites and you (60:16 - 60:20)
don't get many people who connect with (60:18 - 60:23)
you well SBJ I connect with you one of (60:20 - 60:25)
the things that got me interested in (60:23 - 60:26)
your podcast was finding out your (60:25 - 60:28)
twitter handle which seemed to be based (60:26 - 60:30)
off of abacus dragging the lake (60:28 - 60:32)
compilation albums from back in the day (60:30 - 60:34)
the first Atticus dragon-like album (60:32 - 60:36)
introduced me to bands that are still (60:34 - 60:38)
some of my favorites today including (60:36 - 60:40)
alkaline trio glass jaw the starting (60:38 - 60:42)
line the movie life which tracks based (60:40 - 60:43)
off the dragging Lake compilations are (60:42 - 60:45)
your favorite i'm now off to become a (60:43 - 60:49)
patreon backer cheers Derek long email (60:45 - 60:52)
thank you so much for writing in ah glad (60:49 - 60:56)
that our show has inspired you that that (60:52 - 60:59)
means a lot uh going off my twitter (60:56 - 61:02)
handle you might be the first person (60:59 - 61:03)
who's ever written in that like (61:02 - 61:06)
understood that reference which is great (61:03 - 61:09)
I don't listen to a lot of that music (61:06 - 61:12)
anymore but like punk pop growing up was (61:09 - 61:16)
a big influence to me especially the (61:12 - 61:18)
movie life know that I grew out of pop (61:16 - 61:20)
punk and I moved into hip-hop and then I (61:18 - 61:23)
grew out of that moved into just muse (61:20 - 61:25)
music with no lyrics and then I like (61:23 - 61:27)
went back to hip-hop and then (61:25 - 61:29)
I'm all over the place right now I (61:27 - 61:32)
listen to like like brain music like (61:29 - 61:33)
music that's supposed to help you focus (61:32 - 61:35)
which is like really weird and goes off (61:33 - 61:38)
on my whole like mindfulness and (61:35 - 61:40)
meditation thing but yeah I don't know (61:38 - 61:41)
do you guys have anything to piggyback (61:40 - 61:44)
off his email the easiest way to get (61:41 - 61:45)
your letter read on the program is to (61:44 - 61:48)
praise Steve obviously yeah I don't (61:45 - 61:50)
think this person is real i think this i (61:48 - 61:52)
think this is a plant also it is worth (61:50 - 61:54)
it is worth mentioning that probably the (61:52 - 61:56)
reason it's difficult for people to get (61:54 - 61:57)
the reference of your username is (61:56 - 61:59)
because dragging a lake is just a (61:57 - 62:02)
general term meaning looking at the (61:59 - 62:04)
bottom of a lake for an object usually (62:02 - 62:06)
in a criminal investigation and that (62:04 - 62:08)
would be why they might not make the (62:06 - 62:10)
action to whatever obscure pop punk (62:08 - 62:12)
thing that you're referencing that's (62:10 - 62:13)
true honestly I thought it was a (62:12 - 62:15)
reference to Elvis Costello's watching (62:13 - 62:19)
the detectives you know me I commit (62:15 - 62:22)
myself and I know I commit crimes and (62:19 - 62:24)
throw weapons and the lakes but no thank (62:22 - 62:27)
you for writing in no no no no you drag (62:24 - 62:28)
a lake if you're if you're looking for (62:27 - 62:31)
bodies dude no you can also direct I (62:28 - 62:32)
just don't want to get into the gruesome (62:31 - 62:34)
detail you could drag a like for weapons (62:32 - 62:38)
to Wikipedia it Google out if you are (62:34 - 62:41)
not a fan of or if you've never heard (62:38 - 62:42)
Elvis Costello is watching the (62:41 - 62:45)
detectives it is possibly one of his (62:42 - 62:47)
greatest song so I do recommend that (62:45 - 62:48)
everybody go out and give that song (62:47 - 62:51)
listen and see if it brings you to tears (62:48 - 62:54)
like it does me out of all I will show a (62:51 - 62:57)
mars volta song that references dragging (62:54 - 62:59)
little dragging a lake i think it's um (62:57 - 63:02)
yeah I don't like a little marble so no (62:59 - 63:04)
no mars volta is one of the greatest (63:02 - 63:06)
bands of all time no I don't think so (63:04 - 63:10)
but what are you one of those dudes (63:06 - 63:12)
who's like at the drive-in I don't (63:10 - 63:13)
listen to mars volta cuz i will take (63:12 - 63:15)
mars volta over at the drive-in no I (63:13 - 63:16)
don't I don't I don't care for at the (63:15 - 63:19)
drive-in either let's i had the drive-in (63:16 - 63:21)
live in their reunion tour and like (63:19 - 63:23)
their most recent reunion tour and that (63:21 - 63:28)
was like a religious experience I mean (63:23 - 63:30)
enjoy that but delousing the coma torium (63:28 - 63:31)
is one of the greatest albums that we've (63:30 - 63:34)
gotten Eric yeah I like deal aust more (63:31 - 63:36)
than like relationship of command but I (63:34 - 63:40)
would also say that because at the (63:36 - 63:41)
drive-in is so closely so (63:40 - 63:43)
ciated with that one record relationship (63:41 - 63:45)
of command as opposed to the previous (63:43 - 63:47)
more like emo work that they did that I (63:45 - 63:50)
think they can you can sort of feel like (63:47 - 63:52)
at the drive and never made bad music (63:50 - 63:53)
even though they did because they made (63:52 - 63:55)
some bad stuff before relationship of (63:53 - 63:57)
command but with mars volta like delouse (63:55 - 64:01)
is their best album Francis them you is (63:57 - 64:05)
pretty dang good no one should ever talk (64:01 - 64:08)
about am patek sure ah bedlam in goliath (64:05 - 64:11)
is pretty decent and then it really goes (64:08 - 64:14)
downhill from there so it's like Mars (64:11 - 64:16)
yet mars volta like in recent memory it (64:14 - 64:18)
hasn't been as good as like d lost in (64:16 - 64:21)
the coma torium I mean that's okay and (64:18 - 64:22)
everybody can't be at their best at all (64:21 - 64:25)
times the the dragging dragging the leak (64:22 - 64:28)
albums I think there were three of them (64:25 - 64:30)
if if my memory serves me right they (64:28 - 64:32)
were they were compilations of like a (64:30 - 64:35)
bunch of POC pop punk bands and I know (64:32 - 64:38)
it was started by the the guys from (64:35 - 64:40)
blink 182 let me tell you a BAM that (64:38 - 64:42)
doesn't actually hold up very well (64:40 - 64:47)
blink-182 wrong I did like Tom and Mark (64:42 - 64:50)
or they just cannot sing they're just (64:47 - 64:55)
not good as I could sing yeah exactly my (64:50 - 64:56)
16 year old me would have told you (64:55 - 65:02)
differently but boy that music doesn't (64:56 - 65:04)
really hope I'm inai I have no shame and (65:02 - 65:07)
saying like I still think fall out boys (65:04 - 65:09)
really good and I know a lot of people (65:07 - 65:10)
don't like fall out boy and that's fine (65:09 - 65:14)
I whatever music like music is music but (65:10 - 65:16)
out of like out of that era of pop punk (65:14 - 65:18)
music like fall that boy is something I (65:16 - 65:21)
can still listen to and enjoy and really (65:18 - 65:24)
like blink way to I listened to and I go (65:21 - 65:26)
ah some of these songs are good right (65:24 - 65:28)
like all the small things are like (65:26 - 65:30)
there-there hits but like their albums (65:28 - 65:32)
through and through just there's a lot (65:30 - 65:35)
of junk going through that we don't need (65:32 - 65:39)
to go on music no no more ah Jackson (65:35 - 65:41)
writes in and says hi writing back again (65:39 - 65:44)
I'm I have three questions first off (65:41 - 65:48)
which professor is your favorite also (65:44 - 65:49)
which games do you think of the best (65:48 - 65:53)
starters and lastly give me eat your (65:49 - 65:55)
dream team of from Pokemon (65:53 - 65:57)
sun and moon by that i mean your six (65:55 - 66:00)
favourite pokemon but remember it has to (65:57 - 66:03)
be a strategical and your team could (66:00 - 66:04)
actively get you through the main story (66:03 - 66:07)
i hope you guys have a great day thank (66:04 - 66:10)
you for all the work sent from my zune I (66:07 - 66:11)
didn't realize you're gonna get a (66:10 - 66:14)
homework assignment I know I feel like (66:11 - 66:16)
that last question might take a lot of (66:14 - 66:18)
time but I will say my favorite (66:16 - 66:21)
professor is Kakui that's pretty easy (66:18 - 66:25)
and which games has the best starters (66:21 - 66:27)
I'd actually probably say Jen seven I (66:25 - 66:34)
eat like rowlett Lytton and pop Leo (66:27 - 66:37)
plop-plop-plop-plop Leo popular pop Leo (66:34 - 66:41)
I like them all equally and I like every (66:37 - 66:43)
stage of their evolution like generation (66:41 - 66:45)
5 I liked a pic a lot but I don't like (66:43 - 66:47)
em Bor I don't think emboar is that (66:45 - 66:50)
great i love oshawa i think asha wats (66:47 - 66:52)
super adorable super great but i don't (66:50 - 66:54)
care for samurott so i would say gen7 (66:52 - 66:56)
that last question those very time (66:54 - 66:59)
consuming let me think about it will do (66:56 - 67:02)
your thing I'm still picking ah I think (66:59 - 67:06)
my favorite professor is probably (67:02 - 67:09)
Sycamore just big because I prefer a (67:06 - 67:14)
more mature gentleman I think he's got a (67:09 - 67:16)
little more you know he's got it more (67:14 - 67:19)
together not so foolish and of course (67:16 - 67:21)
he's not married so potentially (67:19 - 67:24)
available for dates and such a favorite (67:21 - 67:27)
starters I'd have to say Jen too because (67:24 - 67:28)
that's where you get your sin de quills (67:27 - 67:31)
and your todo dials and the good stuff (67:28 - 67:35)
yeah but you got an Chikorita dude it (67:31 - 67:38)
ain't nothing wrong with chiquita I mean (67:35 - 67:40)
ain't nothing right with Chikorita (67:38 - 67:41)
either but there ain't nothing rights (67:40 - 67:42)
just like right in that perfect mellow (67:41 - 67:46)
zone of green blob i would i would argue (67:42 - 67:49)
that's chicka rate is fine i would well (67:46 - 67:52)
in a in a contest of all the starter (67:49 - 67:56)
pokemon chikorita is very low on that (67:52 - 67:59)
list chikorita losses hahaha like I (67:56 - 68:01)
don't know what other starter money or (67:59 - 68:04)
starters than Chikorita name one starter (68:01 - 68:07)
worse than Chikorita (68:04 - 68:10)
k fender won the second ok Lytton no wow (68:07 - 68:15)
not now you're raw I was gonna say like (68:10 - 68:19)
that turtle turtle just Oh laughter what (68:15 - 68:24)
it turns into it cuz uh cuz torterra is (68:19 - 68:27)
really cool he's like a bonsai bonsai (68:24 - 68:29)
tree thing twice every I would argue (68:27 - 68:33)
pure junk like I don't want to argue (68:29 - 68:36)
that Treecko is worse than chikorita all (68:33 - 68:40)
right I could see that I okay so anyways (68:36 - 68:44)
gentoo I Travis professor and generation (68:40 - 68:47)
starters professor Sycamore is also my (68:44 - 68:50)
favorite I think he has more personality (68:47 - 68:53)
than the rest of them and he's also (68:50 - 68:58)
cuter then I guess probably gen-6 (68:53 - 69:00)
honestly I think has the best starters (68:58 - 69:02)
you know I just made fun of fennekin but (69:00 - 69:05)
I think in the scheme of things I think (69:02 - 69:09)
Jen's sixes starters feel cohesive like (69:05 - 69:11)
I like John seven starters a lot but (69:09 - 69:14)
they do not look like they like belong (69:11 - 69:17)
together and I feel like Jen's six and (69:14 - 69:20)
actually gen3 do a really good job of (69:17 - 69:23)
having the designs feel like they have a (69:20 - 69:25)
lot of similar elements gen5 as well but (69:23 - 69:27)
i'll just say gen-6 cuz froakie and (69:25 - 69:28)
Trestman are two of my favorites and (69:27 - 69:30)
while i don't really love fennekin it's (69:28 - 69:34)
not that far down in my writings even (69:31 - 69:35)
though I was just trashing him the last (69:34 - 69:38)
question i mean i would i would probably (69:35 - 69:42)
still go with the same team that i had i (69:38 - 69:46)
mean i had criminal I had to canon I had (69:42 - 69:49)
in sinaa roar I had a low and raichu I (69:46 - 69:55)
had a genetic I can't say its name [ __ ] (69:49 - 69:58)
tonic shin addiction otic is fine Shin (69:55 - 70:00)
attic is fine and (69:58 - 70:00)

Palos and there you go yeah i would i (70:06 - 70:12)
would still go with those I (70:10 - 70:14)
I got me through the main story fine i (70:12 - 70:17)
think they were all great like when I go (70:14 - 70:20)
through the main Pokemon story or just (70:17 - 70:22)
any Pokemon game I like to have pokemon (70:20 - 70:26)
that that are either new or just are (70:22 - 70:28)
exciting to me and I knew from the (70:26 - 70:30)
moment I saw sandy gasps and Palace and (70:28 - 70:32)
I like I was like oh I definitely want (70:30 - 70:35)
those dudes I don't care how good or not (70:32 - 70:37)
good or how meta or not meta they are I (70:35 - 70:40)
just want a sand castle on my team and (70:37 - 70:42)
then you had one then everything was (70:40 - 70:45)
right in the world at that point in time (70:42 - 70:48)
what about you guys it's a tough call I (70:45 - 70:51)
mean I definitely want to keep a ribbon (70:48 - 70:56)
because that's super cute i wantcha (70:51 - 71:00)

psychic right shoes lullaby to you as (71:27 - 71:34)
real gray that'd be a good time fun time (71:30 - 71:40)
dude and then probably (71:34 - 71:40)
you can't have volcarona in sun and moon (71:40 - 71:46)
I would need what is my birdie dude (71:43 - 71:49)
called to can anybody now my birdie (71:46 - 71:53)
buddy picolet sling fletchinder and Tala (71:49 - 71:57)
flame hahaha like for the rest of all (71:53 - 72:00)
Pokemon history any team that I build (71:57 - 72:03)
myself if I have like the full menu of (72:00 - 72:04)
options is either gonna have volcarona (72:03 - 72:06)
or talonflame or volcarona and (72:04 - 72:11)
talonflame so since in this option I had (72:06 - 72:13)
the option to have talonflame I don't (72:11 - 72:15)
get me a talonflame all right all right (72:13 - 72:18)
Travis I would give a similar answer to (72:15 - 72:20)
you Steven that my answer is just going (72:18 - 72:22)
to be the team that I had in sun and (72:20 - 72:26)
moon because well I pick the pokemon (72:22 - 72:28)
that I think are cool and want to have (72:26 - 72:31)
on my team so it ends up essentially (72:28 - 72:35)
asking the same question my team was (72:31 - 72:39)
mimicked you rob um be a lowland Persian (72:35 - 72:45)
a lowland raichu pre bominable the (72:39 - 72:45)
situation a dark-type and that's really (72:45 - 72:50)
redundant type coverage but hey those (72:47 - 72:54)
are the pokemon i like all right thanks (72:50 - 72:56)
for reading in last question here is (72:54 - 72:59)
from Don add time to weigh in on an old (72:56 - 73:03)
topic you guys ready for this I'm (72:59 - 73:06)
probably not alright living in Canada we (73:03 - 73:09)
don't have access to red vines as you do (73:06 - 73:12)
in the south but recently I tried some (73:09 - 73:14)
can finally end the debate when (73:12 - 73:16)
comparing red vines to Twizzlers it's no (73:14 - 73:19)
contest Twizzlers win every time red (73:16 - 73:20)
vines don't have the right consistency (73:19 - 73:23)
to be considered licorice but if you (73:20 - 73:26)
classify red vines as a chewy candy they (73:23 - 73:28)
do have a unique texture and an amazing (73:26 - 73:31)
cream soda flavor red vines are an (73:28 - 73:33)
amazing candy but Twizzlers are the (73:31 - 73:38)
ultimate licorice agreed so here's the (73:33 - 73:41)
real kicker I have no recollection of (73:38 - 73:44)
red vines or Twizzlers being relevant to (73:41 - 73:46)
this program at all which just goes to (73:44 - 73:48)
show how long we have been doing this (73:46 - 73:50)
garbage piece of it may have been an (73:48 - 73:54)
immediate segments that Travis was not (73:50 - 73:56)
involved in it no now Travis was here (73:54 - 73:59)
Travis what let's start it now what side (73:56 - 74:01)
are you on licorice is terrible (73:59 - 74:05)
universally the head bad that's all (74:01 - 74:07)
right so I first off red vines are (74:05 - 74:12)
superior no yes second ad in has (74:07 - 74:16)
declared I also like how he considers us (74:12 - 74:19)
the south because the three of us live (74:16 - 74:22)
in northern states and so today like (74:19 - 74:25)
technically them below Macy Dixie yeah (74:22 - 74:28)
yeah we'll doesn't make the cut will (74:25 - 74:30)
definitely makes the cut he's like right (74:28 - 74:32)
next to the White House that's the cut (74:30 - 74:33)
the one hell of the cut is the (74:32 - 74:36)
mason-dixon line we made that for a (74:33 - 74:41)
reason it's a real thing it has has a (74:36 - 74:43)
pretty nasty history associated with it (74:41 - 74:45)
but that is the wreath that is the (74:43 - 74:47)
official thing that separates the north (74:45 - 74:49)
of the United States from the south I (74:47 - 74:51)
just think it's funny because I've never (74:49 - 74:53)
been like referred to as the south but I (74:51 - 74:55)
guess Canada has priority on the North (74:53 - 74:59)
everything south of somewhere that being (74:55 - 75:05)
said I will concede red vines do fall in (74:59 - 75:12)
unconsidered usually the 299 American (75:05 - 75:15)
dollar bag of red vines gets you the (75:12 - 75:19)
most consistency for for your purchasing (75:15 - 75:24)
habits because if the bags are bigger or (75:19 - 75:26)
smaller I feel like sometimes they don't (75:24 - 75:31)
hit peak Red Vine taste the only spent (75:26 - 75:33)
only be a thing this would normally be a (75:31 - 75:36)
type of statement that I would find (75:33 - 75:37)
flabbergasting that you're making (75:36 - 75:39)
because it just seems like very wild (75:37 - 75:41)
claims although I have similar (75:39 - 75:43)
experiences with cheezits I feel like (75:41 - 75:45)
the size of the box of cheez-its you buy (75:43 - 75:48)
like the very large boxes have very bad (75:45 - 75:51)
cheez-its yeah I think it's the same (75:48 - 75:51)
with with (75:51 - 75:55)
soda to like I and and that's it that (75:51 - 75:56)
has to do with how it bottles it right (75:55 - 75:59)
like I think a can of soda tastes way (75:56 - 76:01)
better than a bottle of soda I think (75:59 - 76:03)
there's like more crisps crispness and (76:01 - 76:07)
like the way the carbonation like it it (76:03 - 76:09)
feels more bubbly in a can and I like (76:07 - 76:12)
that a lot uh and so maybe it's how they (76:09 - 76:16)
like bag / package red vines or the (76:12 - 76:19)
cheezits in this case yeah I I feel like (76:16 - 76:21)
there's a certain bag of red vines you (76:19 - 76:23)
have to buy to get the best flavor and (76:21 - 76:27)
so I will admit that red vines can taste (76:23 - 76:29)
bad but that's only in the the way (76:27 - 76:31)
they're packaged and I don't know about (76:29 - 76:33)
that I don't know honestly I don't know (76:31 - 76:35)
that about Twizzlers because i don't buy (76:33 - 76:37)
Twizzlers enough like why would I buy (76:35 - 76:39)
Twizzlers when when when red vines are (76:37 - 76:42)
there but red vines are good the (76:39 - 76:44)
religion you you buy Twizzlers because (76:42 - 76:46)
you want something that you can bite (76:44 - 76:50)
into and like I mean I am obviously the (76:46 - 76:52)
one who's constantly you know stop (76:50 - 76:54)
feeling things with your mouth for (76:52 - 76:55)
people who complain about foods because (76:54 - 76:57)
of the way it has a mouth filled stop (76:55 - 77:01)
don't taste food don't feel it but but (76:57 - 77:05)
red twizzlers you bite and there's a (77:01 - 77:07)
chew and and there's consistency to them (77:05 - 77:09)
that red vines just completely lacking (77:07 - 77:11)
I'm starting to realize why I have no (77:09 - 77:13)
memory of this it's because I just I (77:11 - 77:17)
mean it as as listeners know there's a (77:13 - 77:19)
lot of there a lot of things that will (77:17 - 77:21)
do this to me but just I'm gone you (77:19 - 77:23)
start arguing about which piece of (77:21 - 77:26)
garbage candy tastes butter and I'm just (77:23 - 77:28)
so what's the good candy yeah well I (77:26 - 77:32)
can't refuse candy no I mean candy is (77:28 - 77:34)
just bad i don't like sweets so I'm sort (77:32 - 77:36)
of biased anyway (77:34 - 77:39)
like I don't just generally like candy (77:36 - 77:42)
so if you're arguing about like reeses (77:39 - 77:44)
versus whatever is a competitor to that (77:42 - 77:46)
I would be similarly bored if if you had (77:44 - 77:50)
to buy a candy though if if you walked (77:46 - 77:54)
in and said hey you were you were on uh (77:50 - 77:55)
you were on a date with Professor (77:54 - 78:00)
Sycamore and mm-hmm attention and they (77:55 - 78:04)
said listen I want you to pick out a (78:00 - 78:06)
candy that both of us can enjoy what do (78:04 - 78:08)
you buy event I mean that's the kicker (78:06 - 78:11)
right is because I I know that the (78:08 - 78:14)
typical human being enjoys garbage candy (78:11 - 78:17)
but I I so I probably I mean well (78:14 - 78:20)
actually no professor Sycamore is um a (78:17 - 78:22)
cultured individual so he would probably (78:20 - 78:25)
also enjoy dark chocolate like I do all (78:22 - 78:26)
right I do enjoy a dark choc I'm not (78:25 - 78:29)
gonna argue with a chocolate eighty (78:26 - 78:30)
percent ninety percent what's your (78:29 - 78:32)
what's your pitch the the darker the (78:30 - 78:35)
better generally all right what about (78:32 - 78:37)
white chocolate how I feel about that no (78:35 - 78:42)
the battle that's not even chocolate no (78:37 - 78:45)
I'm react I'll eat a white chocolate but (78:42 - 78:48)
i would i would take out your granite (78:45 - 78:52)
I'll take a a milk chocolate probably (78:48 - 78:53)
over a dark chocolate but i'm not i'm (78:52 - 78:55)
not going to shy away dark chocolate (78:53 - 78:56)
I'll tell you what though there's this (78:55 - 78:58)
chocolate I think it's made by godiva (78:56 - 79:02)
that has cayenne pepper is that that is (78:58 - 79:04)
a pupper yes it has cayenne pepper on (79:02 - 79:07)
the inside and I didn't ever think that (79:04 - 79:09)
spicy chocolate would be a thing I would (79:07 - 79:13)
enjoy but boy spicy chocolate is a thing (79:09 - 79:17)
I enjoy my brother lives in Columbus (79:13 - 79:20)
Ohio and there is there well there's (79:17 - 79:22)
actually a bit of an ice cream rivalry (79:20 - 79:24)
in Columbus Ohio between a place that I (79:22 - 79:27)
believe it's called graders and a place (79:24 - 79:28)
called Jenny's graders is the more (79:27 - 79:31)
traditional ice cream like you you know (79:28 - 79:34)
chocolate vanilla strawberry or your (79:31 - 79:36)
traditional flavors and I think a lot of (79:34 - 79:38)
the purists tend to like graders but (79:36 - 79:39)
then there's another institution called (79:38 - 79:42)
Jenny's which is a much more hipstery (79:39 - 79:44)
and they have a lot of strange flavors (79:42 - 79:47)
stuff like head lavender there once um (79:44 - 79:49)
which (79:47 - 79:51)
uh you know it tasted like lavender (79:49 - 79:56)
smells my mom's favorite at jenny's is (79:51 - 79:58)
an ice cream that's chocolate and (79:56 - 80:00)
cayenne pepper and she adores the stuff (79:58 - 80:02)
and I think you can actually order it (80:00 - 80:04)
online so if you like that Steve I think (80:02 - 80:06)
you should order Jenny's Queen City (80:04 - 80:08)
Cayenne cuz all right it is quite good (80:06 - 80:10)
ice cream I'm gonna look into that cuz (80:08 - 80:12)
yeah I uh I never thought I'd like it (80:10 - 80:14)
but it's really really good well there (80:12 - 80:18)
you go the debate is the debate is the (80:14 - 80:21)
debate let's wrap up this episode Travis (80:18 - 80:23)
give us our pokemon of the week and (80:21 - 80:26)
we'll go from there oh yeah that oh yeah (80:23 - 80:28)
so our pokemon of the week this week is (80:26 - 80:33)
Wigglytuff it was sent in by a listener (80:28 - 80:34)
and Twitter they asked I don't have (80:33 - 80:37)
their twitter handle real quick but i'll (80:34 - 80:39)
get that as travis goes Wigglytuff (80:37 - 80:42)
doesn't get a lot of usage in VGC 2017 (80:39 - 80:43)
but because it's because of its ability (80:42 - 80:46)
competitive which is the same ability (80:43 - 80:48)
that melodic has access to which we (80:46 - 80:51)
mentioned a few weeks ago it isn't (80:48 - 80:54)
completely unusable competitive is very (80:51 - 80:56)
great because of all of the pokemon (80:54 - 81:00)
namely arcanine that have intimidate (80:56 - 81:02)
competitive as we mentioned before will (81:00 - 81:04)
increase your special attack by two (81:02 - 81:06)
stages any time any of your stats are (81:04 - 81:10)
lowered which includes one the pokemon (81:06 - 81:13)
with competitive is subjected to (81:10 - 81:16)
intimidates loss of attack so you get (81:13 - 81:18)
intimidated and then your special attack (81:16 - 81:19)
goes up by two stages I'm going to (81:18 - 81:22)
feature to move sets here the first is (81:19 - 81:24)
from Gabe Brown and its Wigglytuff with (81:22 - 81:27)
assault vest the ability competitive the (81:24 - 81:30)
EV spread is for and HP 188 in defense (81:27 - 81:33)
236 and special attack 12 and special (81:30 - 81:36)
defense 68 and special defense I don't (81:33 - 81:39)
see justification here for why that EV (81:36 - 81:41)
spread is useful it's actually kind of (81:39 - 81:43)
strange that you would invest that much (81:41 - 81:45)
in defense over HP because I'm very (81:43 - 81:48)
precise though yeah yes I'm sure it's (81:45 - 81:50)
there for very specific reasons like to (81:48 - 81:53)
live a very specific thing that would (81:50 - 81:55)
normally one hit KO it so I'm not sure (81:53 - 81:57)
what we're trying to avoid there but (81:55 - 82:02)
timid nature with Thunderbolt hyper (81:57 - 82:06)
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt hyper voice (82:02 - 82:10)
dazzling gleam and Fire Blast now as (82:06 - 82:12)
we've talked about assault vest before (82:10 - 82:15)
which increases the special defense of a (82:12 - 82:17)
Pokemon but prevents them from using any (82:15 - 82:20)
nondamaging moves that's why V set is an (82:17 - 82:23)
all-out attacking set moveset gives you (82:20 - 82:27)
your to stab types in hyper voice and (82:23 - 82:28)
dazzling gleam to give you the same type (82:27 - 82:31)
attack bonus and then coverage of stuff (82:28 - 82:37)
like cart Anna or um the occasional (82:31 - 82:40)
magnezone with Fire Blast and then (82:37 - 82:42)
Thunderbolt covers flying types and (82:40 - 82:45)
water type stuff like a rack wanted or (82:42 - 82:49)
pelipper um that sort of thing and (82:45 - 82:51)
generally this is less of a specific (82:49 - 82:55)
counter to arcanine as melodic is we (82:51 - 82:57)
talked about how melodic is specifically (82:55 - 82:58)
a counter to arcanine and some other (82:57 - 83:00)
pokemon like guard Trump I'm Wigglytuff (82:58 - 83:02)
because we're not running you know like (83:00 - 83:04)
a water-type move you're basically (83:02 - 83:06)
trying to (83:04 - 83:08)
get the benefit out of the pokemon with (83:06 - 83:10)
intimidate without necessarily being a (83:08 - 83:12)
specific counter to that Pokemon you (83:10 - 83:15)
just want to be able to go in with a (83:12 - 83:17)
boosted special attack and just be (83:15 - 83:20)
generally good um the other alternate (83:17 - 83:24)
here comes to us from I don't really (83:20 - 83:25)
know how to pronounce this user name is (83:24 - 83:30)
it Dame cog a dom Academy comi gamma Chi (83:25 - 83:34)
get yet Kamehameha sends us Wigglytuff (83:30 - 83:36)
with citrus Barry and I mentioned before (83:34 - 83:37)
on an episode that I didn't know why (83:36 - 83:39)
people use Sitrus berry over the berries (83:37 - 83:42)
like I Appa berry and those sorts of (83:39 - 83:43)
things and I realize it's because those (83:42 - 83:47)
ones trigger at a lower HP reservoir (83:43 - 83:48)
then does Sitrus berry so anyway (83:47 - 83:51)
Wigglytuff with Sitrus berry the ability (83:48 - 83:53)
again it's competitive this EV spread is (83:51 - 83:56)
252 and HP for and special attack and (83:53 - 83:58)
252 in special defense this is a much (83:56 - 84:01)
more defensive Wigglytuff and this is a (83:58 - 84:04)
calm nature with hyper voice dazzling (84:01 - 84:09)
gleam disabled and wish um disabled in (84:04 - 84:15)
which are interesting choices especially (84:09 - 84:18)
for doubles in disables case because (84:15 - 84:21)
there's a lot less switching when there (84:18 - 84:24)
are only for pokemon that you can bring (84:21 - 84:26)
into a battle so whereas in singles (84:24 - 84:28)
where disabled you don't really end up (84:26 - 84:30)
using because they can just switch out (84:28 - 84:33)
and get rid of the disabled you end up (84:30 - 84:35)
harming your opponent a little more in a (84:33 - 84:38)
doubles scenario with access to disable (84:35 - 84:41)
especially because you can end up (84:38 - 84:44)
disabling important stuff like protect (84:41 - 84:46)
or that sort of thing yeah I mean (84:44 - 84:50)
similar similar thing it's it's you (84:46 - 84:52)
accept it in this case instead of being (84:50 - 84:54)
a little more offensive in this case (84:52 - 84:57)
you're very defensive so you're banking (84:54 - 85:02)
on getting the special attack boost from (84:57 - 85:04)
competitive not so that you're like an (85:02 - 85:06)
offensive powerhouse but so that you (85:04 - 85:08)
have very good bulk and a decent (85:06 - 85:11)
offensive output and the ability to hit (85:08 - 85:13)
multiple multiple opponents with stuff (85:11 - 85:15)
like hyper voice and dazzling gleam wish (85:13 - 85:18)
if you don't know is a move that (85:15 - 85:21)
well after if after two turns heel (85:18 - 85:24)
whatever Pokemon is in that spot a (85:21 - 85:26)
considerable amount so you can sort of (85:24 - 85:29)
use it to recover HP another move people (85:26 - 85:32)
are talking about in slack that's worth (85:29 - 85:36)
considering is the move heal pulse which (85:32 - 85:39)
is a move that as it suggests heals your (85:36 - 85:42)
partner Pokemon and a lot of occasions (85:39 - 85:47)
people use that if the Pokemon partnered (85:42 - 85:49)
with the heal pulse user is like a setup (85:47 - 85:51)
sweeper something's like a snorlax with (85:49 - 85:55)
like curse or belly drum or even trying (85:51 - 85:57)
shenanigans with like speed swap with (85:55 - 85:59)
Farah mosa or something being able to (85:57 - 86:01)
constantly heal the pokemon that's been (85:59 - 86:03)
bulked up by those sorts of stat (86:01 - 86:07)
increases can be pretty devastating if (86:03 - 86:09)
you get it set up and that's you know (86:07 - 86:10)
usually a big if so that's another (86:09 - 86:12)
consideration I think that's enough for (86:10 - 86:15)
Glee tough right yeah there you go (86:12 - 86:16)
Wigglytuff and its evolutionary (86:15 - 86:19)
relatives share the same category name (86:16 - 86:22)
as qwilfish and drifloon they're all (86:19 - 86:25)
known as the balloon Pokemon Wigglytuff (86:22 - 86:27)
has the highest HP of all fairy-type (86:25 - 86:31)
pokémon and in its earlier appearance (86:27 - 86:33)
wigglytuff's white stomach did Alton did (86:31 - 86:36)
not always extend above its map mouth (86:33 - 86:39)
but however it does always in modern (86:36 - 86:45)
appearances it looks like after crystal (86:39 - 86:48)
they change that by going by the sprites (86:45 - 86:52)
here and a shiny wiggly puff is more of (86:48 - 86:55)
a purple than instead of a pink instead (86:52 - 86:58)
of bluish eyes the eyes are more (86:55 - 87:02)
greenish so if ya care about Chinese (86:58 - 87:05)
there you go it's a decent looking shiny (87:02 - 87:07)
really tough is twenty-five percent male (87:05 - 87:12)
75% female and it is normal fairy one of (87:07 - 87:15)
the pokemon that got their types changed (87:12 - 87:19)
once generation six rolled around was I (87:15 - 87:21)
the only one who was i I know I'm not (87:19 - 87:23)
the only one but where the two of you (87:21 - 87:25)
disappointed when chancy and bliss II (87:23 - 87:28)
didn't get fairy type a little bit yeah (87:25 - 87:29)
I guess I don't really think about it (87:28 - 87:31)
are they just normal (87:29 - 87:34)
yep Quran that's weird yeah I just (87:31 - 87:37)
hadn't really think about it hmm (87:34 - 87:40)
interesting uh by the way that request (87:37 - 87:42)
was sent in by at Boulder snap on (87:40 - 87:45)
Twitter they asked if we could make a (87:42 - 87:47)
competitive move set for Wigglytuff so (87:45 - 87:48)
