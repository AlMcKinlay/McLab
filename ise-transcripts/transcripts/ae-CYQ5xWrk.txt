[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 250 fourth episode of the pok√©mon podcast it's super effective i am your host SBJ and with me today i have Travis I have been struggling all week to think of a way to explain to listeners of last week's episode that pocket trumpet is a real thing and not just a funny goof i made up because I sounded terrible when I played the trumpet last week it's a real thing I really own it but I have no way to prove that over this non visual medium you tweeted a you tweeted a picture I did but they can't hear that that's all right wouldn't I think it's a pretty small minority well maybe not minority but not everybody listens to the show as a Twitter either and would bother going on Twitter to see a picture of a to investigate it yeah figure it out speaking of small I have will with us today we all have musical accompaniment now right oh hell no let me pull out my pocket trumpet well we wait wait can you can you do it e on the pocket trumpet um no because apparently it's not in my room anymore I don't know where it is it's so small Travis you lost it apparently so what's steves instrument going to be I I have zero musical talent I know what I find that I'm very believable yes yes you are correct though I believe that you don't have any musical tail there you go you said the same thing I did yeah yeah no I ki I am surprised there's an audio show every week based on how like tone deaf I feel like I am well there's nothing we can do to correct that at this point in time so yeah just gotta live with a fortune good good ol MPs school systems back in back in this voice welcome everyone welcome to another episode of the pokemon podcast I already said that if you are a new listener thank you for joining us I'm just going to do a rundown of what we're talking about this week we're going to get off topic like we always do unless there's nothing exciting to get off topic about then I had some Pokemon news some regarding Pokemon go world championships some other things and then we have a ton of emails I've just been really digging the email segment so I've kind of been last week it was like the longest segment I think the week before that it was also pretty long and you guys have been sending in way more emails than the normal so we're gonna just go through that inbox and tackle those emails and then travis has our poke amount of the week and then we'll end with our house cleaning segment so that's what we got anything new and exciting report on your guys's end ends and yes yes I i I've had two burritos today the Mexican delicacy and both of them were absolutely awful I had a breakfast burrito from district taco and it was yucky and then I had a lunch burrito from chipotle and it was not put together properly and I was very disappointed what was in the breakfast burrito like eggs Barry so I don't know so ah there were eggs their eggs I think I could have had bacon but I selected chorizo and said and potatoes and then there was well cheese it's like one of those mmm cheese peas Gigi's oh no that was one of the my complaints no actually you know what there was cheese but just not enough cheese but definitely no sour cream um no guacamole LA and it was just like so like I've never been to district taco before so she said oh do you want the salsa on top or on the side and I was like mmm I mean I guess I'll have it on top I don't understand what that means because to me a burrito was a hand eating food yeah the old haiyan eating device yeah then it was on top of the tortilla right is that where this is going well it's even worse the burrito came out in a bowl and basically the salsa was actually like a soup that had been poured over the entire burrito what I had to eat the burrito with a knife and a fork this was a breakfast burrito uh-huh in a bowl yeah it was your first time at district nine district taco I would not go to district nine I do not want to turn into some sort of alien creature yeah then what we take some weird turns it's a really good movie but the whole premise of like oops i ingested some oil I'm turning into an alien that fails so weird turn that's what I'm saying is it I do appreciate a lot of that it feels much like a district taco breakfast burrito I will ask chuck was this like a so it's a wet burrito just a regional thing around here or is that all over the place wait wait whoa back what is a wet burrito yeah this is must this is news to me because to me as I said a burrito is a hand eating food and hand eating food yeah not be wet I want to go on record that I don't like burritos but continued Travis yeah so wet burrito is I'm guessing what I am I will admit a lot of ignorance to even Americanized Mexico in Mexican cuisine so I don't uh I just didn't grow up eating a lot of it so here's like the Google search want you to search for what burrito the image search that I'm showing the two of you so it's the burritos great great audio yeah the burritos sort of sit seated in the sauce oh I see I ask because that sounds like what sort of like what will is describing and that air is kind of similar to what i did get as my breakfast burrito but that to me what you're showing me looks more like a chimichanga well no chimichangas fried and this looks like food i got in san antonio which they called tex-mex i think that is a cuisine yes alright so there is a restaurant in Grand Rapids Michigan where I don't technically live in Grand Rapids anymore but basically where I live and they claim to be V and I never knew if wet burrito until now if that was a regional thing or not but this place the uh about what is it called Midwest behind bar claims to be the birthplace of the wet burrito and they have quite the jingle on the radio advertising their their establishment but that comes on all the time on the radio that that's that's quite a doozy do you want to hear it can you play it on the trumpet Oh better I'm warm enough the golden pipes right now oh you're you're you're gonna reenact it all right all right here we go the beltline bar famous mexican cafe it's the great taste of mexico right in your neighborhood and the thing where was the wet burrito at night you know they didn't sell me on this not now that your singing was bad it just doesn't seem like that great of a jingle no no no you don't the bet the thing about the jingle they hilarious and amazing is the fact that they clearly like when you're writing a jingle you write the jingle to fit the words primarily right because you want like the name of your restaurant to be remembered they clearly wrote a melody and then wrote lyrics to it afterwards which you would never do with a jingle because the way that it's accented because of the melody is mexican cafe but you would never you never pronounce the word like that and i find that endlessly fascinating that it's mexican cafe not mexican CAF like you know like it's not how you would actually say the word and it's hilarious to me that you would write a jingle and not think about making sure the jingle it's written in a way that allows you to pronounce the words the way that they are typically pronounced and yet it's stuck with you I don't challenging my brother and I make fun of it like every time we see each other but that's certainly eyes it it sounds like the the jingle for yamaha suzuki of mineola which is a plus let me gallon let me hear let me hear a rendition nope alright it is something that I heard like so many times when I was a teenager listening to you WD re that even though it was a terrible jingle it's I can still hear it in my head 20-something years yeah I don't know any jingle 12 I don't know if I'm impressed or confused if if Travis consistently listens to the radio or oh I don't I don't something to remember the last time I have dozen to the radio but it is so indelibly burned into my understand how often they played it and how often my brother and I make fun of it today and I think they still I think I heard it not too long ago in one of those rare instances where I actually was listening to the radio so I think it's still in circulation hmm well I mean with the with a legendary jingle as that why would you why would you take it out of circulation the beltline bar famous Mexican Catherine xican restaurant in Grand Rapids Michigan how would you think how much are they paying us for this ad like how much I don't think anything I mean I don't think the beltline bar needs to pay for that ad has just played so many times that I think it just gets grandfathered in you know Oh IRA dia de Becque really in the old jingle clause mm-hmm not to be yeah I was gonna say that's the that's the estranged spin-off of the Santa Claus franchise yeah my favorite uh my favorite mythical movie ah this is a podcast about Pokemon so with that being said let's move it to some pokemon news first bit of news here is let's celebrate pokemon day it's coming back year to a

Pokemon world championships yeah that's interesting right now they just have on that channel last broadcast august twenty-first 2016 all right mmm sounds good I will say my favorite thing of Pokemon day last year was when they did all the movies in a row on Twitch yeah that was I was hoping they were gonna do that again this year but it out of the what 12 bullet points i read you that's that's not an option but i might stream something pokemon related on pokemon day to stream all the pokemon movies yeah yeah sure i'm will care I'm sure that'll be fine right having a Nintendo as it I've realized this pokemon company but Nintendo in general has been pretty lenient with that sort of thing yeah yeah they what they want as much pokemon out there as possible right yeah uh yeah I might I might do something I'm poke Monday twitch related or or or something else but it's cool it's mainly I pull out that Pokemon dual stream you've been teasin for so long I thought about it yeah I still have not opened the app so it's still super super fresh to me it is cool that they are doing this again I'm glad this wasn't just like a one-off thing that okay this is the second year they're doing Pokemon day and yeah it's not as great as last year but we they they continued doing it because I do think it's a great reminder and the most wonderful time of the year and business-wise if they're if they're doing as much stuff as they are here and they're doing that every year that's that's enough to hit websites or other publications that maybe normally don't report about Pokemon to report about Pokemon than which in terms reminds people that Pokemon exists because oh oh that just brought something to mine yeah um the digit I don't know if you guys knew but like Geico is sponsoring a tournament of champions of Pokemon VGC right now as we speak we're yes we're in this yes and in their advertisement for it they literally said due to the recent return of popularity of Pokemon we're holding this tournament while what what what do you mean like pretty reported clarity there were there late by 12 months like I would send Pokemon was way papi way more popular in July of 2016 than it is today februari 25th whenever rapport decides that pokemon x and y are among the top selling pokemon titles i think was sun and moon past it well great for sun and moon but still x and y did not do poorly and that's like three and a half years ago no i think sun and moon past Omega Ruby office a fire at this point but easily done yeah I mean projection wise sun and moon looks like it's going to outsell everything but the the the first two games yeah I don't know ie I think the the pokemon go joto definitely rekindled some interest in people but obviously the hype around Sun and Moon definitely helped but I would argue that Pokemon has kind of been a slight decline since then and obviously if you're in the competitive scene if you're if you're in the TCG or you're playing competitive Sun and Moon you're not seeing that but if you're just a casual player maybe you completed your pokedex by now there's not really that much to do maybe I'm you want to switch over to go and catch some johto pokemon but spirit we mean if you're outside of the Pokemon bubble maybe but speaking on a place that I live oh god the competitive scene locations and dates for the 2017 north american international championships in 2017 World Championships have been announced the international championships will take place between june thirtieth through july second at the indiana convention center in indianapolis it looks like they moved back to Indiana last year i believe we were at the oh ha the cleveland ohio columbus ohio convention center so i wonder what that was all about there must think they probably just couldn't book those dates right and they had to move somewhere else I mean is maybe a little price difference or when none of us went right so I I couldn't tell you if I couldn't tell you if that venue was bigger or smaller or maybe just didn't work out for them maybe it was cheaper and they went and we're like as in the same working we can't fit our inflatable Pikachu through the the side door here I want to hear it what are the horrible things will could say what are they oh not for this podcast certain people who used to live in Indiana who now are my neighbors can we leave it at that sure sure mmm this uh there are there are no residue residency restrictions for the North American International Championship this event is open to all Pokemon TCG and video game players around the world in addition to the exciting prizes for Pokemon international championships this will be the last chance to earn significant championship points on the way to the World Championship invitation then on August eighteenth through the 20th the top players from around the globe will converge at the ana anaheim convention center in anaheim california to battle the 2017 Pokemon world championships only the pokemon TCG and video game players who battle at the championship series events throughout the season and managed to earn enough championship points will qualify for this prestigious competition competitors will be battling for the title of world championship and a share of over five hundred thousand dollars in prizes finally pokemon tournament players will have a chance to show off their skills at the Pokemon world championships on Friday participating in the Last Chance Qualifier tournament will battle for the remaining seats for the Pokemon pokin tournament world championship then the 2017 pokin World Championship will take place on Saturday August nineteenth finishing with the grand finale on Saturday night where I prize pool of twenty thousand dollars will be there players will be competing using the Wii U version of poking tournament who is there still a pokin scene happening existing I mean know if you enjoy fighting games hey no I mean they've still had pocket an epi I still say it the wrong way at like evo right yeah i was at evo there was there was some bidding thing where people were donating to get poked in at a future tournament i'm not sure which one that was but it did raise quite a bit of money and i think they are including it at i don't want to say it's evo it could be but i don't i know i'd be wrong with whatever would come out of my mouth but yeah they're the people who are playing that are still into that I mean you could say like is there still a street fighter 4 audience and yes there is for that game in street fighter 5 and killer instinct him oh like all those other fighting game people have their their definite niche of we're gonna continue playing this game and get getting good at it well I mean that's the thing right forever for the fighting games people like specialize in a particular fighting game get really good at it and then they go and compete so they don't care whether it's popular with the casual populace they just care whether they can actually continue to play it competitively even though there hasn't been an update for it in about a year yeah I want to say well what is that that game's going to be two years old this year right 201 it's over a year old it's definitely over a year old so yeah it's good asked me two years old I looked this up because I was on I was oddly poking subreddit about two weeks ago when they were talking about the future of pokin somebody was talking about the update i looked it up in the last update was like six or eight months ago it was it was quite a while ago but I think the game came out in October of 2015 wow I pretty sure it came out in march of whatever it definitely didn't come out in March will look it up well look check the wiki it came out July sixteenth 2015 so older that I thought it was Wow wait wait wait what's that Japan or us just what the quick link from wiki said here we go we you as March 18 2016 Japan vindicated yeah good poll will march 18 yes it's not a year old hey heard of your first boom no that's not the first time you first alrighty of you planning on going to the Nationals or well I guess you can't go to words unless you're invited but are you guys thinking of going the Nationals it's a tough call for me because bushiroad is having a what they call a grand fest which they typically only do in Japan they're actually having one in their california area the same weekend would you like July 4th weekend and I can't do both and that's like a really rare opportunity type thing that that's happening so i'll probably end up not going to either but it's a it's a tough call because yeah that's either a second drive to Indianapolis right I can't drive to what at Long Beach Long Beach California that's where the Vanguard one is gonna be gotta fly yeah but airplanes cost a lot of money and son as you know I was explaining to Travis you know in about four days I will not have any legal documentation proving that i can get on an airplane so good oldies be Travis I would go if enough owls of mine were there that's always been the kicker right is if enough my friends are going I'll go but isn't it hasn't been like the same weekend y'all have gone to gencon the last like three years no Jen it's always it's always been at least recently when I say recently like the last three to four years it's always been that fourth of July weekend and gen cons always end of July or August you beginning of august early August so it's very hard to take a trip down to Indiana twice in such a yes time yeah especially based on how expensive gent ganas sure but yeah if I mean I don't I don't think enough of my pokey pals are gonna be heading down there and it's not really that rad of a time to just be like hey I'm here by myself playing yeah the pocket monsters because I'm not good right like it it would be worth it if I were just really good and actually had a shot but i don't so how do you do pretty well it really assume DC's ah i know enough to get in trouble good old dad line over here is that a dad line I thought it was just like as said wow I mean sure I got two more bits of news here Pokemon eggs to be distributed it distributed in Japan to celebrate Easter celebrate Easter six different pokemon eggs will be available at pokemon center and pokemon stores in japan for march 18th through the through april 9th for Pokemon Sun and Moon marini Oran guru pacinian turton ater grandpa and Gumi will be available in eggs only one of these eggs can be obtained per day from our March 18th onward if players show a Pokemon hatch from one of these gift eggs to an employee at a pokemon center they can receive a Pokemon training guide these guides are limited one per person and are only available until supplies run out those are some pretty hard Pokemon to catch so those eggs are actually worth it yeah they're all at like five percent encounter rates and marina you have to do through SOS battles along goomy you have to do through whether s 0 or lush jungle yep it's also funny that I think isn't gumi the only one in that list or did I miss one I think goomy is the only one in that list that is it that is not a gen 7 yes oh come on right unless I mr. note that is correct yeah York weird it seems like you would just do all gentle Jen's Evan yeah final article here is a polygon calm pokemon chief says approach to games needs to change if brought to switch me read the article real quick the pokemon company confirmed instant in September it would be supporting the Nintendo switch in an interview CEO ishihara said the company would need to rethink on how it handles titles on the system if it decides to incorporate the new technology ishihara sat down with Japanese business and technology website Tokyo zakia online to discuss the future of Pokemon including Pokemon go and new games on switch when asked how the pokemon company who was looking to get involved with nintendo's new console ishihara suggested the way the company approaches designing its main title games like Pokemon Sun and Moon would have to change if the new console was incorporated Pokemon has been about being portable and now there is the switch which is a portable home console so it has a bigger screen and higher specs than we're used to ishihara said as translated by neogaf somebody apart from the main games we make stuff like pokin and pokemon mystery dungeon so i am thinking that we should make a game that suits the switch but at this time i cannot confirm any projects ishihara added that if they were to develop a game if they were to develop games primary for the switch it would have to be different from the way they've handled making portable games in the past but it wouldn't be elaborate but up sir but wouldn't elaborate it it's still unclear if the company intends to release get a game like pokemon sun or moon for the console the switch may act like a gamecube wii or wii u in the in which became the go-to consoles for offshoot pokemon titles like pokemon rumble pokemon our revolution and pokepark wii Pikachu's adventure it was rumored last year that a game codenamed Pokemon stars which would act as the third iteration of Pokemon Sun and Moon would boot would be released mid-2017 but the pokemon company hasn't confirmed those rumors more information is to be expected to be released by the pokemon company throughout the year about what its plans are for bringing Pokemon games to the console so there's your article I think we've talked about this a little bit there was I know there was a conversation last week where we said where I said that every studio every Nintendo studio is making a game for switch that was confirmed by somebody at Nintendo but I think try think Travis asked if that included the pokemon company I said I'm pretty sure it did but now we have confirmation that they are making something they just haven't said what and it's gonna be different than anything we've seen before hahaha it all comes together and Pokemon Sun and Moon I mean I mean we like the switch to me is like a bigger game boy advance right there was the game boy advance to the the 3ds or to the DS I'm sorry to the d/s was more of a dramatical change then just going back to us a switch at this point it's just one screen that's bigger it worked it worked yeah so my curiosity is more around the wireless interactivity and like does the switch have the ability to do like local battles you can connect a seven other consoles that's true that's a tour that's true all right so then the real question becomes are we going to have a Barry mixing mashing some sort of contest using the joy cons I want to feel the berries as I smash them into pokeball that HD Rumble up on those berries yes this is the most important feature of that must come out of the whole research of the pokemon company gamefreak get on those berries well Pokemon normally shows something off around March for the year what if the joy can actually makes you feel like you're throwing a pokeball want that HD Rumble I mean you can feel an ice cube you might as well be able to feel a pokeball yeah yup you sold me yeah I don't know what to really expect the the the rumored game pokemon stars was was reported by Eurogamer which reported pretty much everything correctly on switch more or less i'm sure they got one or two things wrong but they got more things right than wrong so that's the only reason I really believe the Stars thing also my reasoning for that making a little more sense was just the fact of how poorly Sun and Moon ran on the new 3ds XL and you know some people didn't have problems with that but I think any any battles with the ultra beast really made the system chug a bit and the other thing that kind of really sold me on this whole concept was how high the actual character in pokemon models are outside the game when people pulled the source code and and upper as them and how clean and and great they looked and so just seemed like they were developing a game for a more powerful piece of hardware that didn't exist until you know six days from now how wild is our said mmm switch comes out on March third yeah it's it's exciting and it's it's yeah like you said it's wild to think about that well it's exciting for people who are getting one and then those of us will be sitting in a corner crying playing Monster Hunter iteration yeah well you said you're not getting one because there was there was no monster hunter or no pokemon right I mean it yeah there's nothing like if I had like lots of money just hanging out in the bank where it's doing me absolutely no good then yes I would have gotten a launch day switch but seeing as I actually have a family to feed and a house to maintain that drains my resources I'm going to wait for there to be a more compelling reason for me to get the switch unless somebody got it for me for my birthday and is not telling me and it's gonna be a huge surprise hooray that'd be exciting Travis you're not you're still running with your 20 year old 3ds so that is correct I the closer I get to the launch of the switch the more I am tempted to actually get it I I never get things on launch day but for some reason I don't know why this which is the one that's bad that is more tempting than things usually are for me but something about maybe I maybe I just need something spice up my life right now and I I don't have no wow certain Mars I guess I'm just gonna get really into arms I don't know part of me there's an angel and a devil on my shoulders one of them is telling me to get the switch and the other is telling me not to do it so I'm stolen I just analysis I would be concerned on your part whether the switch will actually work with the Canadian version of electricity you know it's just electricity up there that's what you would like to be yeah that's what they're trying to pit so slowly okay where they have different outlets remember that documentary where they had the elephant that was filmed in Canada what are you talking about I was a throwback to last week's episode well test Tesla vers Edison oh yeah elephant scandal speaking of the speaking of scandals what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a break ganda less and then will we come back we're good instead of very very and when we come back we are going to answer your email so we will be right back [Music] can you figure out why I'm playing the trumpet can you figure out why I'm playing the trumpet [Music] I love the trumpet all the trumpet the soundfont of generation 3 is very different than the previous games and has a lot of loss emphasized mourns in it so that's joke I play the trumpet and we are back from our break let's tackle some emails I have organized my email inbox to make it easier to read these emails here we go oh if you want to send us emails i forgot my my schpeel if you want to send us emails you can do so by emailing s b j @ p km n CA st.com s is in Steve B as in boy j as in Jack in the Box or you can go to Pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button and that will take you to the same place this email here is from Joseph hey spj Travis will and the B team the week of thanksgiving i moved from South Carolina to Boston as a homeschooler making friend making friends is a bit harder when I went to the library yes this still exists yes well I'm all right when I went to the library I use my knowledge of video games to make some friends and now we meet up almost every day to play together so here's my question do you guys ever use video games to help you out in hard times to make friends Joseph from Boston Massachusetts yeah there's this program called it's super effective and most of the people i would call my friends i've probably met through this program does that qualify that's a biggie haha yeah totally um I think the one of the most difficult things and making friends I mean like I think both individuals in meetup of strangers can can both want in both see another person and think oh that person seems cool I bet we would be friends and even though both people have that desire that's not always all you need a lot of the time you need some sort of common ground upon which to start a conversation and video games movie and you any media is right for that and video games especially for the reasons you said because certain video games Pokemon included are profoundly social so they encourage that type of interaction so yeah and and I have gone to the DC Public Library with the they have a weekly Pokemon League and made friends with people there so it's kind of the same thing as being in Boston in doing that probably most of my really good friends I either met via work or like employment jobs that that kind of stuff or because of the actual podcast itself totally a doable means I know Joseph was on the younger side and so once you get more into like a full-time job and stuff like that i think that's another great way to get friends because you're you're stuck with those people for 40 hours a week so hopefully you can find one or two of them that you that you enjoy their company so it was this youngster joseph youngster joey ok yeah yeah yeah finally writing in after all these years we only get the the finest celebrities that right into us robert rights in from Seattle Washington hello spj will Travis and possibly be teen and associated dirty dogs have a quick question for you your D&D campaign was really enjoyable to listen to and it got me really it got me extremely inspired to create my own fantasy content I have gone through and drawn all the characters from D&D and then it hit me could I use the characters spj stance demotius Wendy meepo Winnipeg tali @d pepper and the rest of the them in a comic rendition of my personal take on the story thus far I already emailed Robert and improve that I thought it would be a good idea to ask permission first considering how careful people are with stuff like this these days anyways keep up the good work over at the podcast and I hope you read this on an episode I want to hear Steve say Trick Scott phobia there you go i said whatever that is thanks Robert it's the fear of the number 13 tricks good dekha phobia yeah that's the word PS tell will that he is right about red vines of twizzlers PPS steve is my favorite no thanks uh yeah so I no real question here well I guess the question is can I use those characters to do art / make comic of the answer is yes absolutely I it's like if somebody was to use the it's super effective logo or like the it's super effective theme song or outro I would be very protective of that stuff and rightfully so there's been plenty of apps that tried to use my old logo but for something like like the D&D campaign we did I think it's it's heartwarming to see people like illustrate those characters in their own rendition or what they what they think those characters look like in their mind yes I have no problem with that I think that's really cool and see to see and I like if that campaign meant something to you when you wanted to you know use those characters and draw them or make a comic of those like yeah go for it I I think that's great I don't know if travis has any input on that only that I I totally agree I whether it's that Wendy or Baruch are relatable to you or you just find them to be interesting funny characters I am flattered at any time anyone does anything with those those characters i think it's i think it's really awesome so go for it Daniel writes in from 29 palms California which i guess is 45 minutes away from Palm Springs I didn't even see the original 28 palms I'm Way behind on the franchise oh it's actually a palms countdown between like palm strings little palm strings that would be gross Palm Springs all and string theory where it's like it starts like Palm Springs is technically like 50 palms and then they just countdown as you head towards Los Angeles wait so are you saying there's a 28 palms California 49 palms 48 palm 47 not only the ex palms I believe I mean believe what you want to believe Ripley but you know who's got knowledge of geography okay come on name all of the countries that came from Yugoslavia let's go you've had a year to study up and that I believe you avoid the question the question was what defines a sandwich we need to talk about this because yishun hey I'm just I'm just I'm reading that I'm reading the questions that's all I'm doing here we need to talk about this because I don't know if you knew what you were doing when you were posting fake news on your Twitter account what you posted this falsified screenshot that said the FDA classified hot dogs as a sandwich I saw the YouTube video we're in YouTube personality jacksFilms encouraged all of his viewers to make fake news articles one of which is that the FDA approves hot dog as a sandwich and I have a question for you Steve are you either one a completely uncritical consumer of the news that you see that you just see a thing with a headline and assume that it is true at which point I you you really need to become a more informed consumer of news or two did you know that this was fakin intentionally tried to mislead her audience which i think is enough his words frankly well said well saying so I when it was when it went let's back up a second so the the screenshot of CNN and it said the FDA declares a hot dog is a sandwich I laughed really hard at as as anyone would in that situation because it's an extremely funny headline regardless of context right so the first thing I did is I went to see an end and I searched for it and wasn't there and then i used google news because i figured CNN search engine like any website search engine was not as good as just typing in CNN then the headline into google and then testing to see if google could find the article and it couldn't that time I determined oh this is clearly fake but it was still relevant to the show right because we've had this conversation so often that I tweeted it with the with me like impression of like this is relevant to our listeners and then I got rid of it because I I then thought oh what if people don't know that I'm sure like this is a joke like I know it's a joke because I did the research and like I still think the screenshot is funny I deleted it because I didn't want anyone to think oh this is real because like in my mind it well it's clearly not real I I didn't know that you deleted the tweet afterward that was a very thoughtful move but I did think it was funny and and and for us debating about big sandwiches it way was relevant to our show right I always encourage our listeners to especially I like the subreddit like if something is relevant that we talked about in the podcast like boat race was a big thing for a while share that with us because that's that's great that's like super funny and so some when somebody was like ah like look at this FDA declares a bug by the way it is true that the state of New York does declare a hot dog is a sandwich to go back I did delete it just because I didn't want to mislead anyone I just thought it was funny because it was relevant to our podcast glad we have that settled well I've got news for you Charles Foster Kane well that's really weird was that watching that movie today I mean not that not that is the first time I saw Citizen Kane but I was literally watching Citizen Kane again today now I've got some news for both of you I have moved to a point in my life where I only find it's important to put definitions around actual things that matter and things that don't matter i will leave free to people's imagination and they can have it any way they wish as long as it doesn't have a negative impact on my life and i will remain in peace in Xanadu a sandwich has to have bread about Citizen Kane now now that movies no good whoa or factory Oh snoozer Ino assume if you want to be two dogs and a cat in the middle or if you want a sandwich to be the third planet that NASA recently discovered that can possibly support human life you go right ahead that's a sandwich enjoy it the hot dog is meat surrounded by bread so therefore I think it's a sandwich you're not dragging me back into this arena if you were to put like cheese and mayo between a softshell taco shell that's not a sandwich because of there's no bread in that situation you mean a tortilla yeah I'm sorry I socius and Kane was bad can we talk about some citizen Kane's not never seen it i've never seen it it's just not that exciting it's like there's no explosions oh there's no explosions anytime Citizen Kane is brought up I think of the Simpsons episode where they're walking through the movie Museum and there's like a cane in some glass and it says kid says Citizen Kane above it and Lisa goes hey there's no Kane in Citizen Kane no no it's so funny to me what else do we got here this one is from Scott from Brooklyn New York wheres and we're hot dogs are considered sandwiches what do you all possibly think of the pokemon company adding the ability to transfer Pokemon from Pokemon go to Pokemon bank as some data minds have indicated building on your conversation in episode 252 it could potentially be another shortcut of getting competition ready Pokemon imagine a higher CP pokemon in pokemon go would likely have higher IVs in sun and moon while also giving rope folks a reason to go back to Pokemon go thanks I love all the hosts equally Scott how are the the Pokemon did we ever get a final on how the pokemon that you move up from the virtual console games how they're Ivy's and everything are determined is it a role at a dice or that's guaranteed three perfect ivs everything ulcers random all right so it's probably going to be the same and pretty perfect ivs is not enough to get you competitive buddy that's halfway there there's some pokemon are you you're still gonna have to breed there's some pokemon where if it's like a really hits like a glass cannon type of thing like you're having a 31 IV and defense on you're like a shell gore isn't really going to make it live any hits it wouldn't otherwise so if it likes it really fast Braille Pokemon you could theoretically get away with just HP the offensive stat and speed why don't you just call that Pokemon a choke or Excel gore I think it is so yeah I mean I mean I'm thinking of like it's because of like I mean I thank you from Steve I expected it from you look I get it I get it from playing from playing music in high school and like a cello Rondo and stuff like fee were like Italian it's not in a bland bug it's an American bug from you Nova named Excel Gore what cool I mean it I would I would I would argue that it doesn't matter what did I just Rob ja Rule a sandwich I think it's a Slugger because i think the anime definitely says that but i guess the question is would you want to see pokemon go Pokemon get transferred to seven moon no I think that does that negatively impact either game in any way I think it'd be cool now i think that there's there's enough value and I mean especially if they do it the same way as they do the Virtual Console pokemon that I mean you're still going to have to work to get the really competitive ones you know I I don't think a higher CP well let's ignore the competitive aspect because frankly like that's that's not a big part of pokemon like like yes there are people who love to competitively battle pokemon but as we've seen from tournaments and the amount of people who buy the game there are definitely people who just like to collect and play pokemon well sure so it's going to help you complete B's or IVs or what gets transferred is the fact of how do you feel if the Caterpie you cotton Pokemon go can get moved to Pokemon Sun and Moon I mean I guess I think it's cool yeah there's people who are forming relationships with their Pokemon go Pokemon the same way that we form relationships with our regular pokemon pokemon but what if what if it was a rare pokemon like Dragon Knight do you think that D values I'm making sure the more the merrier it doesn't matter oakham on that are like rare commodities our event only pokemon really and you're not getting those in Pokemon go like dragonite might be hard to achieve within sun and moon because you have to do is dragonair one of the book or dragon yet blessings boom boy because goomy's now i'm sure and go but let's just pretend because goot like you said earlier goomy is a little harder to get in in sun and moon sure but like once you get it once you can breed as many as you want whereas arguably it's harder to get a dragonite in Pokemon go than it sorry a theoretical goodra and Pokemon go than it is to get a goodra in book on sun and moon because he takes a while to get your first goomy sure but then you just evolve it by leveling it up manages a long time to get enough candy is to hold on oh come on go I would yeah that's a that's a feat that's very difficult only a Duvall you said at all i think the more the merrier even worse than that you guys won't even go out to catch ice pokemon when it's snowing out who's gonna go out to try to catch a goodra in the rain haha i hear ya yeah I mean I'm not sayin I'm against it I just was forming a conversation I think I think you guys are right that Pokemon go might be a little bit harder to get said Pokemon I mean obviously you open a Pokemon go and you see nothing but who hoots and and write it as and piggies but those are pokemon that you encounter within the first five minutes of the actual game so i can't imagine that d values or takes away from from the actual in moon or vice versa Pokemon go next question here is from gwark gark from how it's spelled ga ARR UK Garrick Garrick that's a lot so I'm gonna go all right Cincinnati Ohio writes in I'm curious when the next season of your Pokemon dungeons and dragon podcast will come out and I couldn't find any info about it when I attempted to look it up keep up the good work Derek I really have nothing to say on this on this topic I pulled this question too I guess say that because there hasn't been any information of season three mythical out there we talked about this off air last week because you know it is something that that conversations have revolved around and obviously when we finished season two we just didn't it's we've definitely been talking about it and doing stuff with it and what we talked about off air was the whole mindset of I have I have multiple projects in the works and I don't like announcing those projects in case something falls through allen from tuesday night podcast one of the people I coast my board game podcast with said something that you would think that when when you tell somebody you're going to do something that you are more likely to actually do it but in reality when you tell somebody you're going to do something you're actually less likely to do it because you've already gotten the reward of telling that person so if I tell well hey i am going to do an art show in 2018 and we'll goes oh that's really cool awesome like I can't wait I've already gotten the reward I've already gotten the the feedback of like that's awesome that's great congrats whereas now I don't feel like I really need to do it because I would have got that congrats or a good job or awesome I got that now instead of getting it in you know 2018 when the quote-unquote example I would have used does that make sense as I explained that right Travis you're the near the smart person here gee I wouldn't go that far but just long story short visualization is often cited as a tool to help you achieve your goals but in terms of long-term goals actually most of the literature can agrees that visualization makes you less likely to achieve those long-term goals because the act of imagining yourself achieving them gives you a reward and you're it triggers the same reward responses in your brain so you're less likely to actually try to achieve that goal because to some extent you have already partially has received the award for doing so just by imagining it there's a lot that would have to go into a season three there the recording has to be done there would have to be all new music which nick has done fantastic music for the show he's he's the one that's been doing the new break music so there would have to be music there would have to be editing there there that's all on me of like also making a new logo and and getting that taken care of because we're no longer using the old pokeball logo that mythical was originally based off them so there's a lot of work that needs to be done I do want just to let everyone know that that is a constant conversation we're having off air and just you know keep looking forward to it once anything gets announced you're going to hear it on the show first if not via a patreon message or an email or Twitter or Facebook so or all of the above are all of the above so like it is something that that I do get a lot of feedback on of asking where it is I just want to put that out there that you know it is a constant conversation that we are having Boulder snap hi spj listening last week's show I heard you were selling wat zip shirts while that particular item does not interest me I wanted to ask if you were considering much related to mythical I know my secret crush Logan has done a lot of renderings of characters and scenes from the show and I know that was something I would buy in that manner also you are great but will is my favorite travis has his Pokemon of the weak spot which is excellent but I have you thought of getting willed to do also a small spot maybe a TCG card of the week or something to compare with Travis's segment just an idea because I would like to hear more of will thanks and have fun in my hometown of Boston at PAX Boulder snap you no I have an entire podcast called dr check that you listen to every week where it's pretty much me and Cole and Jack just talking about cards they're just unfortunately not pokemon cards yeah uh yeah I've definitely thought about giving will his own segment especially since that since I feel like Pokemon of the week has gotten more let me use a Travis heavy let me let me see buzzwords it's gotten very streamlined uh i think it's it's shorter but more concise I think what Travis did with that and that was really kind of on the fly of like hey Travis I want you to talk more and you know be more prepared and just kind of give off a move set because again i know a lot of our listeners aren't competitive but i do know that some are and so that that segment is is valuable to them and i don't want to get rid of that and so like Travis going through that and pulling move sets from slack and explaining how that Pokemon works and getting that done and like what would you say Travis four or five minutes yeah and and doing that and then be following up with your standard poke my facts I think that works really well and I would love for will dead do something like that but I don't know what that would be especially because what was actually old school will written articles on the website the Pokemon of the week articles that were yeah um I wouldn't say veered because that implies it was unintended but often took interesting strange turns personal personal turns or like interpersonal turns that were very touching i thought i'm a big fan of those so to say that pokemon of the week is my segment fails to acknowledge that a much more emotionally mature version of pokemon of the week was headed by none other than will anderson and and you know there has been a brotherhood of pokemon of the week writers for the website so you can't leave out david thomas who started the whole franchise that's correct you yeah welcome Thomas from wendys no net well maybe we don't know we don't have enough information I well isn't dish I thought well actually we kind of do well doesn't play the the the pokemon TCG so I don't know if a card of a week would be great cuz Yuri I mean I could make stuff up but it's probably just gonna be shaming e x every week until I hear some other card people complain I don't want to fall down any any wells of I don't know where I'm going with this tippy-toe fall down the well I think that it's super effective really relates to a time and place in all of our lives and I say that because when we started off the show we ran down six different pokemon in teams and how that works and that was me with very little knowledge why I thought at the time that I have not a lot of knowledge about the video game and I proved that I didn't but people for some reason like that segment and continued listening to it and people always right in has to bring back feature team so maybe I did something right when that segment was introduced and when I was playing the card game very competitively that there was the the show itself was much more TCG focused and that gave Travis at least a good 20 minutes to zone out and then you know when will and I were playing shuffle a lot we would cover a lot of different shuffle news at the beginning of the show when Pokemon go came out you know most of those episodes were very pokemon go focus so if one of us were playing the TCG we would probably definitely have more TCG stuff to talk about ah but I don't want to force that on anyone of like well will you supply the TCG so do a TG TCG segment just because we have to like we don't do anything on the show because we have to we we just do it because that's what's organically happening in our lives at the time and I think that may I don't know I assume that's why people like the show yeah I mean that's part of it and and you know yes I enjoy playing the TCG but there were reasons why I stopped playing the TC and those reasons haven't changed at this point I mean maybe they will change but at this point they haven't so I think there are more theoretical we'll segments than just TCG of the week I think I think some thinking out of the box i mean if you just wanted to talk about new trading card games everything i guess a guy i'd be proud i gotta hear about all of them yeah we could we we can brainstorm brain storm something but no i do agree that that I feel like we'll should have a dedicated you know four to five minutes like Lake Travis does not more not any more than that because I I have to hear myself talk the most so clearly we can't take away time from that that was a joke by the way to the beginning question the zip shirts by the time you hear that they'll probably be closed for pre-order we ran those for two weeks as mythical related merch I don't have anything in mind that show doesn't do as well as it's super fective so audience why's it might be you know we might might move a couple but I don't know a lot what I will say is that I do plan on doing a Kickstarter soon and that's there's a lot of reasons for that but I think really the main reason is for merch yeah and I say that because with the patreon like those like all our patreon backers are fantastic and I appreciate every single one of them even if they gave like a doll or a month or you know two dollars and 22 cents which I think somebody actually gives like that's all fantastic and that reward is getting into slack and there are other rewards to that but there are noting that there are no physical rewards and every now and then I like to do a short run which like the zip shirt is one of those but I don't I don't do a lot of short runs because there's just so many shirts out there in the world and there are a lot of cool ones and there are a lot of though there are just a lot of cool ones that exist for periods of time and you know they might be forgettable but there's always like I could sign it on the internet every single day and find a cool shirt that I would be willing to buy but also at the same time I have way too many shirts in my closet so it's just something I don't do and I feel like a lot of people fall fall under that like shirts are just everyone has too many of them and there are already too many great designs out there but as for the reason doing a Kickstarter is yeah that'll give us a couple more bucks to upgrade equipment or two to you know use that money to do other stuff for conventions or shows or or whatever we decide to put that money towards but it gives the it lets us do merchandise in a way of like okay you know exactly 50 people why I want this kind of shirt I go back to shirts but let's just say a shirt cool we know exactly 50 people want that shirt we know exactly what size they want because of Kickstarter and we gave them a time frame of two months so we can get those shirts made and shipped off but more so that we that with the case starter that I plan on doing this spring I have Nick making custom music for it so there'll be a little digital soundtrack that you can get of Pokemon music that isn't actually pokemon music but that is inspired by Pokemon music so that's really cool that's something we can offer I have my co who is an extremely talented artist doing some great portraits that I'll be able to canvas print and if you don't know what canvas print is it's it's like a stretch piece of cloth with the image printed already framed and ready to go so really it's like one nail in your wall and you can hang it and also that'll be in poster form which is you know frame it yourself getting a poster too but canvas print that's my way to go i love canvas prints so you i have micah doing some stuff i have nick doing some stuff i'll be doing some stuff so that the really the kickstarter is here's a bunch of pokemon podcast merch you can get physical things whether that's buttons stickers artwork music and you can help support the show and mostly that money will be going to making that product shipping that product and getting it into your like getting it into your hands so it's not like all that but like I think that's the confusing thing of Kickstarter is like oh you just made you know twenty thousand dollars on you know whatever like these brand new socks I'm just thinking of a Kickstarter I backed which might have been some socks it's not like that person just got twenty thousand dollars the person has to now make those sacks and fulfill those orders and ship them out and that costs money which that's what the Kickstarter pays for that's really why the why the Kickstarter is happening I don't know if I made any sense right now but I mean you kind of did but now it'll never happen because because I said elevation but yeah that's that's what it's going down for so uh hopefully that that's something that's cool for you guys like the last Kickstarter we did which is over two years ago was was what I what I thought pretty successful so we'll see I also know that some people don't like giving their money to patreon and they trust Kickstarter and so that's just another way for you know somebody to feel comfortable throwing five bucks our way and then getting some stickers in return I have so many it's super effective shirts from through the ages that I could probably go like a month only wearing it's super everyday wearing something is super yeah so I don't know that's it's exciting but maybe i'll make some like mythical stickers or something of the sort and have that as a as a kickstarter reward with patreon is just very hard to do physical rewards on that platform just the back end does it doesn't make it easy for that to happen that's why pretty much everything on our patreon is like digital-only of okay you get into slack okay you getting a slack but you get access to this channel okay you're getting the slack but you also get access to these downloads that are hidden behind a password stuff like that do like two more questions this is from Tommy from Columbus Ohio do your will I enjoy I enjoy it when Travis talks about philosophy love Tommy pS If any other listeners also enjoy Travis's Wow philosophy digressions go check out the podcast arbitrary archive where whoa where ontological and extra cents extra 10 I can't say that musings reign supreme whoa I don't need it this is not my question is why was this addressed to me I think you said last week you didn't want to hear about Travis ramble I believe I said the opposite because Travis said he did not want to talk about hey Gillian dialectics and I said let's talk about hey Kelly dialectics I that is true I did opt out of the dialectic ah that's just not a particular area of interest of mine I don't think we've talked about ontology on arbitrary archive or web because it's just we talk about media I very much appreciate the free plug this it I know you're gonna think that this deplane oh yeah that this email writer is a plant especially given that they live in Columbus Ohio which is the same town where my brother the co-host of arbitrary archive also lives um but no that's that's not actually actually the case this was completely um on land I I appreciate the free plug for arbitrary archive we had a pretty good episode just go up what did we talk about I can't even remember it was all but I'm sure it was great it was that good you could remember we talked about a podcast called the infinite now and then the popular film out right now the lego batman movie Batman the old Batman Batman Batman not not Batman Batman give me like Superman and Aquaman is due in this spot the the great model here of spider-man I knit four semesters of Slav selasa fee how you guys let that DJ for civ 5 4 so that semesters of solazzo face as anyone who went to a Jesuit college or university is required to take four semesters of philosophy english wearing off on both of you yes I enjoy philosophy I did not enjoy those courses because one of the most painful things about taking college and university required philosophy courses is the people who will never ever be able to comprehend philosophy philosophical concepts being required to be in those classes with you it is true torture and I kept end Travis for getting past those beginning stages and into the higher levels of thought well it didn't ain't it ain't a cakewalk once you start getting only the pretentious what's a family friendly word I can use the pretentious dingbats that i mean i won't i won't say that that's true of all of my classmates because there were I'd met some friends and although the surprisingly small amount compared to my other major which was I made a lot more friends in the film department that I did in the philosophy department but the thing is you start to get the type of person who is not in philosophy anymore because they have well I mean this is me try this is an assumption on my part but from there from their actions it seems like they're not there to learn more about the subject matter they're just there to say heidegger's name a whole bunch which is kind of troubling but yeah you sure to give the type of person who just wants to be there to show that they do no philosophy things and because philosophy classes tend to be sort of open discussions they have free rein to just randomly all the conversation to whatever their specific ad area of expertise is which can be infuriating but it's a really rewarding discipline and it what's the best way to word it I think that through all of my years of studying philosophy I've never found something that precisely matches that I am totally convinced by like not nothing I saw I was like this is exactly how I see the world the way this philosopher things but I think it is very valuable to be presented very different seemingly strange and bizarre ways of seeing the world because challenging your own baked in tendencies of these like assumptions you make and intendin sees of interpretation I think rattling those cages a little bit can be a good exercise and philosophy is probably the best way to do that and and I agree and that's actually as the last thing I'll say on this one of the reasons why I typically do not discuss philosophy in public is that I tend to be much more comfortable exposing extreme points of view than people are comfortable with hearing them and people I tends to sometimes trigger emotional responses which definitely this is not the forum for getting into those kinds of conversations there you have it there you got there you have it Nicholas rights in from cornea Cora Noah California cornea nothing sure it's right next to pupil california go on probably next level seven 49th Palme ya isa a deer spj and company there has been an episode there has been episodes after episodes that upset me spj he's clearly a host of the show huh without him the show would not do as well I don't know about that I can clearly see all the hard work he does for the show and I feel more connected to him as I too cannot pronounce words let alone names of countless Pokemon this is not to be confused with not appreciating will or Travis because they do keep up the good work and I hope one day that I can make it to one of your live shows at a convention I don't have a question so you make up one for me if you want you can use my name I know for a fact I am the only Nick in or neah let alone all of California all right we'll make up a question what does make Citizen Kane so great well I would argue that haha the fact that the the formal elements really forced the audience into the interpretation that um that Wells wants the audience to come to our immaculate like think about how the the main journalist is is always framed from the back you're always looking over his shoulder and he's always poorly lit and and that's to get to prevent the audience from identifying with him in a meaningful way that to make sure the audience knows that he's just a cipher and that this is really Kane story and not to think that the Ark of the film is watching this journalist get information about Charles Foster Kane and instead is actually the arc of Kane himself and I think these little formal flourishes that lead to a very sharp and almost uniform interpretation regardless of who the audience is what makes it considered to be the best film of all time so you so you've missed the entire real question that we should be discussing which is moulin rouge is actually a better citizen kane than citizen oh oh here is this like home improvement where the neighborhood know you're gonna ask but no this isn't anything like home improvement you can't see his face until the very final episode yes that's exactly what this is all right good that's what I thought oh well too one more question just because uh we need a palate cleanser after yeah we can we can't and on citizen kane a jordan rights in from chris tri-cities Washington a comment from an earlier show asked what you would like to see in a future switch pokemon game and I wanted to voice my wants and I would like a whole 3d revamp yes I know this will likely happen now I know this will likely never happen but I would want a 3d pokemon game where you would be able to walk around like pokemon XD TV pokemon in the grass we're like final fantasy 14 so it's not random encounters but you can still be surprised and whatnot I would also like 3d battles not like Pokemon not like pokin but like pokemon stadium or Coliseum I also would like to ask I love the TCG but I can only play digital versions because you can get packs for free sometimes but my mainly because it doesn't take a physical space I'm very disappointed I can't get into I can't get the pokemon TCG on my phone but I can get magic hearthstone yugioh etc how do you guys feel about the digital verse physical formats thanks for the show guys it's been a pleasure to listen each week Steve you are my favorite podcast host but will is the best also waiting to hear that eat that Travis email so I read this message boy because we're going to read the Travis email right now now I'm just no we're not doing it right now I'm still teasing it will get to travis's email eventually ah ok couple of things to break down it looks like Jordans concept was the whole seeing the Pokemon instead of random encounters a lot of games do this Final Fantasy 15 final fantasy 14 for some reason final fantasy games were the only thing sticking out on my mind but uh what do you guys feel about that I mean that's just adding to the verisimilitude of the pokemons experience so I'm all in favor I mean they do try something like that because on like pony island they have the shadows of the Pokemon running through the grass but it turns out to be like a primeape or something that comes after you and they have the shaking trees and something jumps out at you and they have the shadows of the bird Pokemon which actually started in jan 5 best gin so I mean it's just a sets a progressive step from that right where you have a more clearer representation of the pokemon that is you're about to encounter yeah we basically already have pokemon stadium or pokemon colosseum level battles because battles are in 3d now so we've got we got that one I think it's more like the camera movement and everything we have camera movements too but there are no cameras on the switch correct no no I mean like and not like physical cameras I mean like when you know I'm just saying that you you can't have an AR pokemon game on the switch because there's no cameras yeah yeah right that's correct I don't think the AI don't think AR is the question I like the I think the question asker just means a more cinematic battle yeah and we're clearly going that way right we're just not completely there yet even though i would i would say that it is probably doing things a lot better than stadium has but that's a that's a pretty old game but i get i get the concept right as fly the thing about the thing about foregoing random encounters in favor of style of something like Chrono Trigger where the monsters are already placed in the environment and you run up to them to start an encounter that I even in the sun and moon rendition of it like will was talking about and the gen 5 version to it I don't think you can do that for even the majority let alone the entirety of encounters because Pokemon is so built around having a variety of Pokemon in each area that if you could see what Pokemon it was before you are about to interact with them I I think that kind of fundamentally breaks one of the core experiences of of playing pokemon and that's knowing that you can get a Pikachu in Viridian Forest and having to work to get that Pikachu because it's a low encounter rate right like if you could see oh no that's the silhouette of a Caterpie I'm gonna skip that that's a silhouette of them that upon I'm gonna skip that I think it fundamentally changes the game in a way that's a little less interest I mean it's it's certainly not more interesting and maybe the same but I don't I don't think it's necessary at least in my opinion do you agree two of you I think if you were that is this is like see Pokemon I you would probably need bigger areas to go okay there's a there's three or four caterpie's hanging out but then over here there's a chance for Pikachu to show up or something i'm just using your just piggybacking off your Viridian Forest concept whereas in something like final fantasy 14 or 15 or and maybe you can speak to chrono trigger Travis but those areas are so big that there's this there's this fog that happens so it's like well I can see pretty far and I can see these monsters in front of me but if I keep walking i'm not sure what's actually going to be over there until I get there and that's where you know the game could possibly generate other pokemon or whatnot or or certain pokemon are our timer like hey maybe a Pikachu only appears in this area you know every eight or nine hour so it's like okay well that makes a little more rare but now I know like oh I kill I accidentally knocked out this Pikachu but I know in about eight or nine hours that will that Pokemon will reappear again and I'll give me a chance to get it it's really the same concept you're just changing the frontal you're just changing the mechanics behind it of how Pokemon are encountered instead of the random chance of them being encountered I think both laser I would not be opposed of seeing it go down a newer route of okay I can see everything I can actively avoid something but if I want to engage I had that option yet the main problem that we're trying to solve is too many zoo bats I let me walk around the freaking zoo back thank you ah the other question Jordan asked was the how we feel about digital versus physical TCG's personally I can answer this really quick uh there is something really great and really special about sitting across the table from somebody you enjoy the company with and actually holding physical cards and that's something that you can't really reproduce in a digital format I think the digital format has the advantage of playing anytime anywhere like if I'm laying in bed at 2am i can open hearth stone and play as many games of hearthstone as i want whereas to am Willa sleeping and also doesn't live near me so I can't just ask him for a game of the pokemon TCG please don't ask me for anything at 2am thank you so I think they're both great I think they both digital card games aren't going to kill physical card games and and vice versa I think they both have have a medium and they both can happily exist together and I don't think there's a right or wrong way to play that ah it's just I think digital provides more convenience but if I have an option I think physical is more social more engaging I don't know there's just something about it that that a digital game can't really reproduce now I agree no consent right I don't play TCG's to win or lose I play TCG's to be social and to be around people so that's that would be completely lost in a digital format the only digital card games that I have enjoyed are the ones that were designed from the ground up to be digital card games I well I guess that's not true when I was younger I had a ball with whatever that PlayStation 1 yugioh game was running that strange example generally I don't you know I when I was into magic I didn't really like the magic online stuff I even though I've never really been into the pokemon TCG that deeply I've dabbled a little bit and play TCG oh is that what it's called i think so and I was never really into that the only just like I said the only digital card games I've liked other ones that are built for it so hearthstone the Elder Scrolls card game isn't bad I haven't played gwent but I know people really like the card game within the witcher which is called gwent and the reason is that those games can utilize mechanics that are really only available within the digital space so think things like being able to produce a randomly generated number without having to resort to dice rolls you can't really do that in a card game unless like I said you do a coin flip or a dice roll which gets cumbersome then you have to carry all these dice or coins with you which is unfortunate because you're already carrying all of your cards but able to just quickly do that or cards that have so thinking about hearthstone there are some cards that have effects where like you pretty profoundly change the state of the game car if you know hearthstone cards like lord jaraxxus that replaces your hero like that good that card is very complicated in its effect like it would be very difficult to tie it to like write all of the effects of that card has on a physical card but it works in hearthstone because you don't really need to explain all that because the game does a lot of that action for you and I think when when digital card games are able to just be digital they can take advantage of those elements but when their physical card games first you sort of just get the worst of both worlds we still have a ton of emails but running out of time so if we didn't get your email we will eventually get to it I have everything now organized to make sure I don't miss emails so if you want to send in an email you can do so at SBJ at pkmn cast or you can go to Pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button and send in any emails related or not related pokemon as the segment proves we'll talk about anything so what we'll do is we'll take one more quick break and we'll come back Travis will do pokemon of the week we'll do some housecleaning and we'll wrap up the show so we will be right back up tons of fun dance a Big Damn dance I've done a fun dance a big damn dance I've done a fun dance a big dan dance abundance [Music] abundance [Music] abundance [Music] [Music] and we are back from our break I guess I mean I have nothing really to say I'm gonna toss over to Travis and they're going to do pokemon of the week and I'll come back and give you some facts our pokemon of the week this week is a generation 5 rock-type pokemon that of course is giggle a--the giggle a--the in gen 7 has the ability sand stream which calls upon sandstorm as giggle if is sent out into battle I will be frank and say that I have never used a giggle with on my team in gen seven so I don't have a lot of expertise using it so because of that instead of having me ramble on about the strategy of using it I'm going to give you three as opposed to the usual to move sets for giggle if because I wouldn't have a lot to add because it don't really feel like I know enough about the Pokemon to give you that meaningful of information so other people are going to do that through me because i am a strange puppet a first set comes from frequent pokemon of the week contributor kevin AKA koopa bras that's an adamant nature with 250 2 v's in HP and attack with the remaining four and special defense your item is going to be leftovers and of course sands stream is your ability the move set here is earthquake rockslide curse and explosion have it having a move set without protect is obviously a little riskier but we're obviously using a pretty risky set here in the first place because we're running explosion rockslide is there because it hits both opponents and is the same type attack bonus move curse is great because it allows you to either synergize with or counter trick room giggle with is already very slow so being able to slow yourself down more makes sure that you are able to go first under effects of brook room earthquake is just good coverage our next set comes from mark AKA what's mark's lat marshmallows yeah yeah marshmallow loaf and that is an adamant nature this one actually is not going to use sand stream so you would use this for the you would use the abilities the ability sturdy here your Eevee's are going to be the same as the one from before with attack HP on the remaining foreign special defense your item is going to be leftovers then the move set is protect Stone Edge Smackdown earthquake mark says the first slot is protect to see what your opponent's working with earthquakes high base power tends to make short work of a lot of Pokemon Stone Edge while only being eighty percent accurate is very effective for giggle if and SmackDown can assist with flying types if you're paired with a round type Pokemon Smackdown is a really interesting move by the way of being able to make flying types or like pokemon with levitate no longer immune to ground types can be a pretty powerful a fact fun fact of Z guards move thousand arrows it's what it's called the signature move of of zygarde also has that same effect it can hit but it can hit flying types just with that move so that's pretty cool too unrelated though and then the third set comes to us from Brandon aka Brandon to 1486 and that set is going to also use sand stream this time we're going to use rocky MZ so we're going to be able to use the rock z move yuri these are going to be 244 and HP 252 an attack and then the remaining 12 in special defense this is going to be a brave nature and this is a more this is a pretty typical set that you would see it's Stone Edge earthquake rockslide and protect the brave nature and zero speed investment allows you to be as as Brandon says quote faster unquote in trick room so another way to take advantage of or or counter a truck room with that fairly offensive move set there like i said i don't i'm not confident and to give you a lot more information than these folks already have about Google Earth so I'll just end it there alright and if you get a shiny giggle if it has blue crystals on it instead of the red crystals giggle a--the was first seen in a triple battle with teammates reuniclus and goth Attell against a blitz ille dharmana tan and drill bur during the oh ha suta episode which aired jun 27th it was not revealed until August seventh 2010 so that was what almost two months before we knew what giggle was even though we saw it early not really that great of trivia but Google is the only pure rock type third stage Pokemon and giggle us evolutionary lion's share similarities with golems family both of them are rock type both learned stealth rocks Smackdown explosion Stone Edge and rock blast by leveling up first of all that 25 final evolutionary stage by trading giggle it seems to be based on a crystal formation good old gen 5 pokemon i really like giggle if it's cool it had a really cool TCG card when i played there it would do 20 times the amount of damage sorry like losing my voice twenty times the amount of damage per fighting energy on it na plus i think it started with a base 20 so you could do a hundred damage with for fighting energy and anyone who played the TCG that's a lot of energy to apply to a Pokemon usually most Pokemon are like one double colorless and then one other energy and you kind of go off there or use other cards to get energy I'm faster but there was a card in the game there was an electrode in the game where electrodes ability was to commit suicide like to blow up and that would give your opponent a prize card because in terms electro fainted so they get a prize card for every pok√©mon that faints on your side but in return by sacrificing electrode you would reveal the top I think 10 cards of your deck and for every energy you found you could instantly attach it to a poke so what you could do is you could explode electrode hope that you get energy cards attached them to giggle if and then all of a sudden your usual if goes from zero to a hundred instantly there was also a card in the game called twins which lets you let you find any two cards in your deck that you wanted as long as you had more prizes than your opponent basically as long as you were losing the match so by forcing your electro to explode you give your opponent one prize card but now you can use this card that lets you find any two cards in your deck which is extremely powerful so you could find something like you could pretty much find a card that would help you look at the top cards of your deck in it like arrange them in a way when you exploded or not when you exploded but when it pretty much obviously because that's after the fact but it sets you up for the the fact that trying to get the the deck to work it was really cool but yeah that's like morn my fondest memories with giggle a--the was that that deck I used and this is why we don't discuss TCG's in the program because trying to get these concepts across in a non visual medium is very difficult yeah yeah I do want to go I do want to say though like I have no hate of the TCG it's just a very expensive time-consuming hobby it is really great oh yeah that's giggle a--the all right some house cleaning you guys made this segment it was all you you did this I've been adding more stuff to the Pokemon podcast youtube channel so just youtube / PKM and cast I've been doing this new thing where I take one to two-minute clips from the podcast and turn them into mini YouTube episodes to see how that works and facebook seems to prioritize video on that platform so seeing if it works there too just because my my home and if I'm giving you guys homework this week and I'm sorry but my homework for you guys this week is to tell one friend about our show and I think by doing these many episodes it's a great way of going like hey this might be something you're interested in or hey look at these guys funny because I know when somebody looks at a podcast and they see 200 some episodes and I see that episodes or 90 plus minutes that might be intimidating that might be a turn-off that might be like where do I start where there's so much here to go from so having these one to two-minute clips really hope i really hope shines a certain part of our podcast that makes it a little bit easier to get into if if you tell a friend that might not be in the podcast but maybe love Pokemon so that's really where we're going with that I do plan on doing some more pokemon center reviews on youtube so and they one or two of them will involve a giveaway so just like a common obviously watch the video hit the subscribe button comment and so trying something with that and with pokemon day and everything coming up hopefully I I can set some time aside to stream something to celebrate pokemon day will Travis and I will all be at PAX in Boston I believe that is March 9th if I am not mistaken and we will be that's one really fly out but I think March isn't March ESR actual yeah that isn't a shin at two thirty to thirty in the Bobcat theater I was told that it's the dentist favorite time so just remember that and you remember to 30 okay that fits 400 people that I've been told so 400 spots there and it is not being streamed so if you cannot make it two packs or you are not in the Boston area and we will be recording that I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to record that yet I will figure out a way probably just check an extra bag of luggage of audio equipment yeah that'll be all great that'll be something I'm really excited for this is the first time the three of us have done a panel together Irene will be there she'll actually be am really pumped yeah she'll actually be helping do the panel we I actually have a really cool concept that involves a lot of audience participation so I'm going to put her to work of running around and making everything moves smoothly but we'll all be there so they'll be really exciting and I think I don't I know Nick was planning something of a meat out outside if you if you couldn't get pax tickets I think we'll set something about a vent bright but no details on that hopefully by much for my birthday okay well birthday and and podcast but we'll we'll figure something out by next week hopefully because that that that trip is coming up soon and the switch is coming out in a couple days I might do something with that as well I don't know if anyone be it would be interested but I know there was a couple people in slack that asked if I was doing a a box opening or just general impressions on switch or just even having a mini episode with my with with some swish thoughts and I think I might go down that route so just stay tuned for that but if you haven't done so already follow us on twitter at Pokemon podcast we have a facebook facebook.com slash pkmn cast review us on
