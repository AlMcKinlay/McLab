Oh what's up everyone welcome to the 214 episode of the Pokemon podcasts it's super effective the premier podcast of pocket arguably that delightful Voice you heard is wait did I say I'm SBJ I didn't say that I'm your host SBJ and were so rudely interrupted the zeros were rudely interrupted by the one and only the trance of you allergist Travis recently tweeted asking polling people how that how they listen to the show what pod catcher they used to listen to the show but the question was just worded how do you listen to the show so my answer to that is usually a week late o mine was through my ears very clever the interesting thing about Twitter polls is you can only have four off yeah it's also annoying because tweetdeck doesn't read them and I that's what I use so if I ever want to participate in those it also doesn't isn't very clear that a poll is even attached to a given tweet but whatever yeah teapots the same way yeah I asked the people who make tweet pot because they're usually on top of the third party Twitter apps and they said that Twitter never gave anyone the API for polls so they can't I would assume that's for everyone so they can't actually like and put it in their app until Twitter releases the API and who knows if Twitter's that we're going to do that but itunes 1 by the way with seventy-six percent of people saying they listen on itunes twelve percent on soundcloud seven percent on google play music which is news in itself that we are on google play music now cut by five percent on stitcher radio and i forgot to introduce will but he is also here do i have to roll a d20 for initiative in order for us to get more as popular as our founding program dungeons and dragon i'ts DC's gonna be pretty the DC is gonna be pretty high but yeah you have to DC is but i gotta i gotta roll them bones got to get us up there cuz i'm not on dungeons and dragon i'ts so now i'm jealous you're jealous that you're not on and that it gets such good ratings I I need to be on the top rated Pokemon odd yes of the Internet having i guess i know we we don't you know if greg and i did not already have enough problems with his love of faulty pokemon it's just is just making it worse ok ok I I'm here he is as to like what your metric is for top-rated because certainly this show is more writing than done to the Dragon Knights and I thought I thought in the rankings like on iTunes rankings the dungeons and dragon age was ahead of its super effective oh right i don't know they're in different categories for sure like it's super effective is in the video game category and dungeons and dragon it's is in the other games category with like it's in other games because that's where all the other D&D and board game podcast are with that being said the video game category is much more saturated and much more competitive and there's i guess those are the the two milestones that sometimes puts it's super effective a little far back but the last pretty much for all of 2016 it's super effective has been in the top 50 most downloaded in the video game section if not higher than that and dungeons and dragon its sits in life the top 20 or 30 of the other games section of itunes hmm where is dr check other games dr check would be other games because it is a card game so most card games would be in that and other than other ganz is that way less competitive than like video games and obviously drive check wouldn't fall under video games that's in the top 10 right of other games i don't i am unaware of the stats i mean i could pull them up for you but but i can at least say this where the the number one cardfight vanguard podcast that it still puts out episodes my in all in all fairness I mean you gotta do what you have to do to make yourself feel important though the wikipedia page for my hometown so muskegon michigan is the biggest city on Lake Michigan's East Coast the amount of qualifiers that were needed to make that point where are a lot but I feel like it's that sort of qualifications you need to do to make yourself feel good so whatever whatever you need to do it to really make drive Trek feels important as it is you got you just got to do it and then it that it's kind of funny cuz my hometown in New York they always advertise that their name used to be saw pit because as if that town didn't have enough problems as it is they want to advertise it they used to be a dump no Jack check is awesome where the number one cardfight vanguard podcast that is putting out episodes in 2016 I'm officially call us at the number one action comedy drama musical in America we're also that where we're fighting Hamilton for the beer for that space oh Lord I know we normally don't talk about pokemon for the first couple minutes here but I went to break in the floor mat I went to six flags yesterday great america really yeah town it sat in Gurnee Illinois ooh it is very close to a stake and shake which I enjoy and was the primary reason I agreed to go to six flags because I am and not a amusement park person I mean basically don't like fun things right yes yes a hundred percent but I will say the amount of Pokemon knockoffs of like giant overstuffed Pokemon plushies were very rampant mm-hmm among gonna knock offs I mean it's like it's not the the high quality Pokemon Center washes but if i remember right there just they are pokemon flushes it's not like a knockoff but they're just not very high quality yeah there I mean squirtle look like he was having a bad day hanging up there yeah yeah but it was I mean not that I would have I think it was it was always like five dollars for one play or ten dollars for three plays or something ridiculous like that but i was looking at all the other toys and unless you are like a big fan of generic unicorns or a big fan of just a giant snake the pokemon i'm a big fan of a giant snake let's not get anybody about that give me the anacondas whatever else other kind of snakes you can think of I'm thrilled Oh constrictor yeah rattler now Rattlers a little tiny Viper I think I thought they were like I guess they are smaller than I'm like me a cobra regal yes I guess like why would what I don't know maybe it's because I I like pokemon but like why would you go for you know the the generic teddy bear when you can go for the you know derpy looking Turtwig when I was there the the pokemon plushies were pretty popular prizes I mean that was years ago when I was in high school and we went on a marching band trip but to the same six flags I don't know if it's the same one but I mean what they're what are their likes eight six flags and I guess it's cedar point that we would go to and they'll get you mixed up yeah I think that's no hi oh yeah yeah that's the one thinking of yeah supposedly there's a Six Flags near DC but everybody goes to Paramount's kings dominion so I don't even know where the Six Flags is around here I guess I was more shocked that like there were no like minion prizes or no angry birds prizes or anything like that like as for like of course there's there's your loony toons prizes because I think six flags has some deal with the looney tunes and then there's your Batman spider-man Superman plushies because all the rides are almost all the rides arranged superhero themed Pokemon was like the one weird like here is another franchise that just happens to be prizes but we have no rides or anything else based off it but he hears an obvious franchise that you can win which was confusing but also cool that like is so clearly popular enough as a prize that many booths still had but like in every because six wives broke into sections like here's your western section and here's your future section and here's your kids section like every section had if not one but two booths where you can win pokemon stuff ya know people still have those fond Pokemon memories but it's not but that's the thing is that it's not just it you'd think it would be oh it's just flying off gen1 nostalgia but at least at cedar point when i was there and this again this was years ago i think i got a pimple up so it's not the it's not your entry level stuff well Piplup was somebody's entry level true true yeah there was besides a giant peach you charmander squirtle Bulbasaur there was giant Piplup and jaron turtwig and i think those were the only two none chimchar didn't make a guy bitching same thing only Chimchar made the cut at all no not that I saw at least I was I was I was trying to be observant because I I skipped out on a lot of rides that my mom and Irene went on how did you go with your family I just my mom and Irene and my son no he went alone I well no but I mean like did die his brother go did any of his sisters go we met one of my sisters and her friend down there and was that unloads know like her friend there's no quote stated and we went and we went on like a ride-or- to it them and just hung out and then they they left early because they had other plans that's why they got there so early uh-huh but yeah my mom really wanted to go and then I readin wanted to go and the night room was like I really want you to go and I was like like this stuff but I went just an exacerbation sigh it's basically I'm sorry Steve you're a lot of fun to hang out with alright that's fair that's fair what about what about you Travis what was on your plate this past weekend I ain't bring things full circle but we were just talking about dungeons and dragon i'ts and I actually played D&D within the just the campaign I'm running with my friends so I played DMD again on friday and i'm going to play D&D again tomorrow so my life has been pretty d20 centric but um but you're down with that though that's like yeah I love Danny like your destiny of tabletop Dungeons and Dragons it's like destiny but actually fun do they still make the the Marvel Comics role-playing game that was like D&D except you could be like mutants and stuff I don't know about that one in particular but I mean there are plenty of superhero games and I wouldn't be surprised if some of them are Marvel but I don't specifically know any information about that one I've never played any of the superhero RPGs uh it doesn't really interest me that much I'm not really an expert there see cuz for the next season instead of doing dungeons and dragon i'ts you could do a superhero role playing game with Pokemon in there what do we but yeah but what do we call it though it has to be a pun can't you can't do it Pokemon superhero game nice one it rolls right off the tongue there at Travis have you played a D&D game that has just gone haribol yeah I mean what was that I'm just asking cuz you're you're you're up to like three a week now so clearly you you enjoy it a lot it's something that seems yea high priority of fun for you but then at least with me and board games there sometimes where you play a board game and like the experience is just so sour that you're like I don't want to I think I'm gonna let that board game set in the shelf well then in that I've never had I've had individual sessions of campaigns that as a whole have gone well where I'm like I wasn't a lot of fun like I've had instances with a when I was in college I went in that group I played in therapy sessions where people would be mad at each other just because of general college drama things college friend the things and then would try to steal from each other or whatever in in game and that was just sort of a bad scene but it would never really lasts so long that it would feel like the game was the problem more than the people so we would get back together next week and whatever it was that was bothering people in real life would have gone away and so the next session would have been fine so now I've never had like a full campaign go super south mostly because i only play with my friends i'm sure if i went to one of those places where you go to like a trading card store and they have like a dnd night and i'm playing with strangers that that could go pretty bad but I've not going to imagine that conversation well my DM makes us do role for intelligence before we have to do a roll for initiative just to see if we had better sensations so I don't understand why we're playing this way um I earned this magical item that gets me a natural 20 on every role I do I mean just because you weren't there for that campaign doesn't mean you get to say what my character does and doesn't have thank you I earned this please I mean I mess up I get confused easily are we still on it's super effective or are we doing tuesday night podcast now uh you know little load called name we talked about Pokemon too early so we needed a double back oh I don't have any good transitions of what we were last talking about so let's just move into some news wait I don't get to talk about my weekend no you pimped drive check but i got to hang out with somebody the only person i've ever met who's first and last name are both pokemon all right let's do it what yeah jinx Magby my great friend jinx Magby know his name is aaron weasel except it's not weasel it's buzz el but still his first name is spelled just like Iran the little iron Pokemon dude he's one of our listeners who came to diva to visit DC and I got to hang out and that was cool and we had a lot of good times so fine go with your news wait just to hang out in DC by himself like how I went to an using park by myself uh no he came for a conference and the conference happened to be in DC okay all right well then I guess we move into this you went to see the real great america in our nation's capital actually what makes me sad and as a throwback to earlier in this episode he went to see somebody who does another podcast and I was like oh you came to see your favorite podcaster will anderson and he's like well I came to see one of my favorite I guess sake burn harsh oh all right right first bit of news probably not relevant anymore but today being April 24th is the last day you can download jirachi moment of silence for our lost jirachi you I'm going to be distracted for a moment while i'm downloading jirachi because i forgot to do that oops i don't know what the strict cut off is because it doesn't actually say what time april 24th or I've seen Pokemon last a full 24 hours before the the ending date so if you are listening to this and you haven't you might as well give it a shot it does work for pokemon x pokemon y and both Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire if

Europe does not state the Europe probably game probably getting that they can't afford to stop they just game just game uh we recently watched the dark cry movie uh just a couple days ago for movie night but we'll we'll talk about that a little later here let's just get to get through some news Pokemon symphonic evolutions is going to perform in Paris which is in France fancy on october of 2016 more specifically october seventh and october 8th at the Grand Rex cinema they sound very French hey the growing list yes there you go perfect I don't know a lick of French that's throw the worst pronunciation possible I think that sounds almost okay just Rex is not a very French where is it really like re X re-access hmm i think the big king movie place if you're on south korea I actually don't know how many listeners we have in South Korea and we have a couple but she wasn't stopped 3i love Korean food shiny mew 2 is going to be distributed in South Korea as a part of the Pokemon WCS not sure what that stands for who does little championship series I don't actually know that my beer I was gonna guess I was gonna guess the same thing national glorious world's gonna be in Korea now it's in San Francisco all right well I mean it says national qualifiers for the poor for I'm assuming you're right in that's World Championship Series or something to do with World Championship bortles tiny Mewtwo to distributed in South Korea from a fifth you may 8th at the hand go yo Hyundai department store nothing yeah I mean usually we make fun of your pronunciation of things but oh gosh I don't speak Korean but no actually I mean I I watch a lot of Korean soap operas and that wouldn't do bad maybe I actually like we're supposed to be Korean and like speak curry and the one language like vicks to me is sorry I mean maybe should study some Hangul and like his korean food is like the best I don't think I literally had korean food now you'd hate it yeah really man I the thing that's good so you probably wouldn't like it you might like Korean short ribs the way my mom makes them I'm not really a Ripken ago now short ribs aren't ribs like there's more like little snakes little boys uh no not like hot dogs like little steaks I love hot dogs yeah the shiny I'm you jack kimchi I don't think that you are shows host Sonic the Hedgehog the shiny mew 2 will be level 100 and have the ability unnerve it will have a mutant night why and other moves sighs strike psychic recover and aura sphere the shiny mew 2 will be distributed via infrared or Pokemon X poke my why Omega Ruby there's a pattern here and alpha sapphire so there you go dining meet you for Korea South Korea to be specific new Pokemon go details and images emerge this is from comic book com we're only pulling the best websites here for news I mean we could go worse Travis and I were talking about much worse oh we could go worse we should we should pull up that article in a little bit just to uh to really dive deep into the rumor mill now but most of the stuff comes from a subreddit that is dedicated to Pokemon go take it with a grain of salt here but we do know that there are beta testers in Japan already so most of this probably has some weight as beta test continues on Pokemon go the augmented reality mobile game that allows you to capture metal Pokemon in the real world more details about the game are continuing to emerge recent beta testers confirm to the subreddit dedicated Pokemon go that biomes were now active meaning a certain type of Pokemon would only appear in certain type of terrain and conditions for example a water type of motor Phil found near a river while normal type pokemon like ratata we're seen in dense urban centers it has also recently confirmed that trainers can only evolve their Pokemon via evolution chards the trainer's collect the shards by capturing pokemon evolution shards are Pokemon specific which means you need to capture multiple Pokemon of the same species to collect it off shards once 20 shards are collected trainers can select one Pokemon of that species to evolve Pokemon that involve twice like Bulbasaur trainers will need to evolve pen Pokemon to the first stage to evolve the Pokemon to the second stage some new screen chat screen caps from the game also emerged showing poke one goes pokédex and battle sequence you can check out the full gallery below blah blah blah blah blah blah so really the the takeaway here and why I pulled this article is because of the battle shard information and I wanted to know what your guys's thoughts on that work I find it interesting that although they have a battle system that is not the way in which you've all Pokemon I find that to be strange i realize that the system they're using might be better suited for that type of game but it just seems a little odd to be using so many of the conventions of the property but not that one well I'm happy that there is evolving in any form as part of the game because i really hope pokemon games where there's no no evolving well by shadow and i really hate Pokemon gay dude I what I play three pokemon games every single day that don't have evolving so my hate is a very gentle hatred but still I would prefer for the head and evolution mechanic versus just having different levels the debut album by Will Anderson my hate is a gentle hatred I don't know the exact reason why there would be a shard system instead of a battle system besides minute maybe the obvious reason of they don't want the two games to be so similar to that two games meaning the pokémon go and poke my main series game uh but you see the collecting of the same thing a lot to upgrade something fairly common in mobile games yeah because then you can say if you want to evolve your evolved into Blastoise faster will sell you five cards for a dollar right out mmm then you can accelerate the process by one shard one USD but yeah the I can't wait for Pokemon global Offensive I just realized that that's a joke you can make and fraud it I was gonna say that in in clash Royale oh god you have to collect X amount of a card too upgrade your current card and you could you know by a chest which gives you a bunch of cards which you hope that is the car do you want so you can spend the gold I mean to me besides this being in a lot of mobile game mobile games on the market and it's very popular and it's very easy for people to understand that it's also very easy to what you guys said hide and control microtransactions as in maybe not so much getting shards but getting maybe more pokeballs to catch so if you have a limit of maybe five pokeballs a day and I don't know if this is true not just me talking give a limit of five poke balls a day and you need ten twirls to evolve your squirtle that's going to take you two days powers combined that's gonna are Wartortle that's going to take you two days but if you buy you know 20 pokeballs for 99 cents well you've accelerated that process in a way and you've spent money whereas if you could just battle and that was something normal you could do you could just grind that out in this way you can't grind it out because you're limited by the resources you have if they put a cap on battles that would be very weird whereas if they're poor they're just putting a cap on how many free pokeballs you get that makes more sense at least in gameplay aspect and an a let's make money aspect I mean I'm not gonna disagree yeah really only way to know is wait and see sounds like like Travis's like far away from his mic making a sandwich guy that sounds right to me like butter in some bread I think better yeah thanks Tom yo ma last bit of news here is the pokemon TV app has been updated with the x y&z anime enough well had anything to come it right away but I probably did I was like had a huge yawn coming out of me so I was on mute um was it sure if you were still laughing at my peanut butter joke here let me just run down the bullet points before we get you to censor my channel okay the app updates includes my channel where face and start watching a video it has automatically saved to their channel making it easy to resume later downloadable content fans without the network can still access and enjoy their favorite Pokemon content with the updated app viewers can mark one episode or movie for offline viewing convenience the video will be stored on their device for one week before it's automatically removed that's actually really really cool if you're going on the plane you could download a movie Pokemon movie and then watch it and then be disappointed other two features are rape videos with this fun feature Pokemon fans can rate each video after they finish watching it their stores contribute on an average rating for the video and be curious to see what what is actually like to not liked and then push notifications because we all love that viewers can now find out when new movies and episodes have been added to the pokémon TV app with convenient push notifications and then the pokémon series XYZ the newest season of the Pokemon anime animation they be even in February new episodes can be viewed all year long and the Pokemon TV app shortly after they are aired every Saturday morning on Cartoon Network pokemon podcast not sponsored by Cartoon Network yes um that's uh that's pretty sick because that means that they're moving out of the hulu and netflix markets and kind of becoming their own now I hope they don't start making the appt paid for um I mean we said I said this earlier on a podcast before I've I would have no problem paying pokemon for ninety-nine a month for all the movies and all the TV shows i would go to dollars and 73 cents that's specific well i'm a very exacting science economics is is real man that's where my supply meet demand right there two dollars and seventy three cents but ill oh I go a buck a month considering the fact that they're willing to go it's like five dollars a year for pokemon bank like if they're already setting the bar there I don't see why the the show would be two different of a price well because its actual dynamic content that's made by lots of people over many years in time with video games aren't the video guess you don't have five dollars a year no I've had a couple of people ask me like now that XYZ is on the Pokemon app should they like where should they start in watching the cartoon and I'm like you can you can start from the first XY season and it's worth it and I've actually also had a couple of people's like after I've told them that they're like oh my god this is so incredible and so different than the old pokemon cartoons that it's like it really is worth watching XYZ is a resource though right we'll like now it's like it's a canal you agent it's a continuation from x and y okay well just start off with that season and be all right no because it's a merge of x and y and the mega evolution specials so I actually recommend that people watch both so that you're really ready for like the parts that are going to come in from the mega evolution specials and the parts that come in from x and y is the mega at sorry I obviously didn't check the question just came to mind but is the mega evolution special something that you can see on the Pokemon TV app where does that exist I don't internet in the hearts and minds of the fans of pokemon heart of white hearts what it's the what does the internet tell you I ok Mon mega em all oh I'm trying to type very lightly ash and read the same person oh man why is ash still 10 coma dream theory Gary shipping hahaha Carrie shipping oh man that's fanservice right there see i'm malik shipping specifically come on top of the gary community of ship and to beach after was going what it would even in this in this hypothetical with whom are you shipping Gary because because the term Gary shipping would just imply like I mean hoping Gary gets in a relationship I mean I'd ship Gary with the world friendzone shipping so the fact that will have figured out where to watch the mega evolution special worries me that it's not as easy to find I'm just not very good at the internet and I didn't say my chance so it's not giving me the answers I need wait english dubbed on dailymotion that what is dailymotion haley motion is like where people put videos that get banned from YouTube quickly hey so there's a lot of places like perfect perfect it's that way it's on YouTube it's I'm sure I'm sure this link from Go Go anime dot 0 is not sketchy at all I'm sure that's not a legal gray area legal black area it's you can find it on the YouTube a dub mother can dub ah i will i will leave this news article here just just for everyone who may be curious now that the most recent anime is on the pokemon TV app the pokémon TV app is available on iphone ipad kindle fire android devices and whenever wherever pokemon her soul i believe it carrying the kindle fire / amazon i think there is a specific app for like fire TV and the fire TV stick i do not know if there is an apple TV app and as for i don't know any Google goog I know chromecast or Google cast i think they call it now you can it it works with that to me i figured something out everybody be quiet for a minute and and listen really hard after i say this sentence and we'll get our answer ok ready hmm Alexa where can i see the mega evolution special pokemon oh I mean I don't have an Alexa I mean you probably turned on like three people's Alexa's that listen to the show hahahaha I don't know what Alexa is why it's like Amazon's Siri accept it hangs out in your house and you just talk to your house except I like wicked people are driving and I can go like hey Siri what's the weather and now that's gonna activate in like everyone's car right now wait so it's like for your home though yeah yeah it's like a it looks like to soup cans stacked on top of each other and it's the bottom half is the speaker and the top half is a volume control and a microphone and then if you're so I'm going to activate everyone's Alexa by going Alexa what's the weather and now when somebody's listening to this podcast auralex is gonna light up blue and it's going to go the weather in Milwaukee is currently 45 degrees partly clothed ATS kind of what the weather is right now here's strangely everyone's Alexa knows just by steves tone of voice I mean that they thought it knows its Steve so they only gives the Milwaukee weather when he asks for it I mean I could go allow so when is the heat death of the universe you'll be real sad when she gives you an answer yeah unless the way the weather and milwaukee formation a lot of people matter it what are they acting a lot of Alexa's very confused by interrupting it over and over again okay where do we go what if they actually stop Xbox waiter or nah no wouldn't they actually listen to the podcast about saving my ring stocks doesn't talk to me my ps4 does though I mean I've listened to podcasts that have like talked in depth about Alexa and I definitely had to turn my Alexa off because every time they said Alexa it would like light up blue and start listening is it really that sensitive oh yeah it's really like it knows its name really well it's super impressive Alexa please order will anderson um cards fight my guard card number no wait I need I need I need these really expensive Vanguard cards hold on Alexa please order Jenna dragon amnesty Messiah send to will Anderson's house no you have to go like Alexa add Pokemon Omega Ruby to my wish list there and now that's been added to every one sec yeah it's super effective a five star review in itunes reading gosh this show is just so great ah alright we we need to take a break and reset expectations of all the people that are extremely mad that we've ruined their Alexa experience head back and we are back from our break there was a recent movie night and was it friday yeah it was friday it was friday it was the right and a movie night have you felt it has been an awakening oh we ended up watching da cry the rise of darkrai believe the movie is actually called mm-hmm and I'm gonna give you the 22nd recap here that movie has a lot of fantastic moments a lot of funny things happen a lot of memorable things happen but after the hour and 20 minutes I don't know what I watched I don't know what really happened and part of that was because my attention was not fully devoted to the movie as we were having technically she dare you we were having technical issues with rabbit the service we used and I have to give a shout out to the support team at rabbit as they made sure that even though that the technical issues existed that the movie and the chat remained going the entire time I enjoy your phrasing of that while the technical team made sure that the problems existed and continued to disrupt our viewing so one of the problems so rooms were supposed to cap at 25 our room captain capped at 16 for some odd reason so we couldn't get more people in which was a bummer at one point the chat broke on my computer because I tried to leave and restart the room without interrupting the movie and that was the tone it's ours though another problem but I don't really understand so spoiler if you haven't seen the movie just like in Arceus and the jewel of life they pitch Arceus as a bad guy but in reality he's a good guy the same could be said about darkrai they pitch him as a bad guy at the end you know ash cries because he thinks darkrai is dead and no dark right is duh cries still alive so you know they're very happy obviously darker I was not the bad guy but Palkia and daya are fighting for some reason and they the heroes are quite I mean a tower at the end and if they don't do something at the top of the tower the world explodes worse or gets destroyed and at some point they rot out of time and Bracco's they didn't make it oh what a minute later it's okay because Pikachu did some electric thing and charged the tower and that was fine but backing on that as everyone's climbing the tower i asked chat I said who is the actual bad guy and I got the tower I got the environment I got all these answers but I didn't get Darkrai and I didn't get any Pokemon I just got everything but those three pokemon so I don't know who the bad guy actually was I can tell you I know who the bad guy is in that movie the guy who switches places with his licky tongue yeah the Baron or licky licky whatever it's a lucky I don't you yeah it's just a bad scene generally isn't it a shiny like a lucky too I don't remember but actually I don't think that is that now that you're saying that he doesn't switch places with licky licky he just turns into a licky licky and his licky licky is just like laying there dead the entire time what yeah cuz I oh I mean I I think at one point the licky licky comes comes back because he doesn't stay licky licky very long which again was another misconception I had cuz I thought he switched places with Luke really key but he just turns into a licky licky and I thought it lasted a lot longer than it didn't it didn't but to compare the movie to Arceus in the dual life Arceus in the dual life is just a better movie the story makes sense the story is good i think the twist is actually pretty clever and Arceus and the dual life doesn't really focus on Ash and the other companions it mostly focuses on the story of Arceus I would have to say that's probably currently the best Pokemon movie I have seen to date darle cry the rise of me if you watch the direct the extended director's final cut that's Ridley Scott's real mission no you have to watch the shame in movie because I think that clears everything up kind of like um how the godfather part two you know made everything about Godfather Part one so much clearer and the the shaming Giratina movie just cleared everything up because really what it is it's just like destruction of the environment and dialga palkia and Giratina are all supposed to work together to keep balance in the universe by you in the netherworld or whatever garrett inas negative lambda sculpt zone or the isn't the negative zone I think so no that's a thing from Marvel the but there's something dimension that shoot what is it called Alexa where does garrett ena live oh I still don't have an Alexa but anyways it's like in the shame in movie you see that like when there's disruptions in our store Shin world yep that the it sends like pollution into gear tina's world and then Giratina has to clean that up and then it's kind of like the battle between de algun and Palkia is causing more disruptions and it's quite this is potential that the two worlds can unravel both of them so you know this is very important so the stakes are high yes justice was served so I was delicious I want to thank everyone who came out to movie night I think everyone had a really good time so much that they demanded another movie and I didn't want to didn't want to bite off more than I can chew especially since we only have 19 pokemon movies to choose from so we ended up watching pokemon organs just to cap off the night and it was very very enjoyable so i will post the next movie nick coming up we'll probably do the giratina movie just to finish off that series and then if we do end up finishing on the movies of movie night continues being a set success will probably go back through and and start watching them again for those obviously who couldn't make it to the first viewings you heard it here first Arceus in the jewel life my number one Pokemon movie right now we have to do the shame in one next cuz that's the one well so this is good I had to be there this time it's no good but it may be explained I mean shame is a terrible Pokemon little diamond no shaven just like well maybe after you watch the movie you won't like it so much um so why is that the best one to watch dark cry has a real good voice it explains everything I didn't say it's a good movie it's just exposition real quick will what's your favorite Pokemon movie oh the Celebi one oh my I can't trust your judgment the movies haha Travis Lutter fair Pokemon movie um Oh No Zoroark come on you know zoroark is my favorite Pokemon movie all right I have not seen that one so well I know my least favorite one is the lucario one but I can't tell you what my favorite one is I can't really pin down bukhari one's pretty like when entei was a dad that one time that was weird that's the third movie epic it is spoke amman uh then maybe 2,000 right isn't that or is that the second one no that's the second load I think it's called Pokemon three the movie yes it's a real good title there uh that's the last access of you knows right ah there's no way Pokemon heroes was in theaters the Celebi movie might be the last one theaters but it might have been a little bit out now I saw Victini and Reshiram in the theater yeah yeah it's true that was a one-off but that was also like limited like all in all of Wisconsin it was only one theater for her I'm for worldwide like or United States wide I think the entire movie was the last one we're like every theater I remember riding my bike to the theater when I was like 11 or 12 watching that movie doesn't hold up ah let's let's do a couple emails before we do our poke one of the week just because we have a we have a lot coming in and so if if you want to add to our stock pile of emails when I say there's a lot coming and don't think that's negative i like I truly like enjoy and love reading your guys's emails and then make me really happy to read them on the show so if you want to email you go to Pokemon podcast calm and hit the contact button fill out the form there or you can just email me directly SBJ at pkmn cast calm both ways gets emails to me first email here is from michael v he writes in saying for Pokemon Sun and Moon should i buy a regular 3ds or a new 3ds because i sold my 3ds and now i need one for pokemon sun or moon thanks for your opinion keep up the good work well a new 3ds is not going to be required but monster hunter generations is coming out is that required for the new 3ds uh so either maybe not but I mean it helped with monster hunter on its own I'm sure it will help with monster hunter generations I have never bought any of those little upgrade systems ever and it's always been fine for me yeah if anyone was going to use the extra features of the new 3ds it would be a Pokemon game no doubt because they were the few games that use the dsi features but obviously they used the Game Boy Color features back when the gameboy color was the minor upgrade even though at the time that was such a big deal I i think if if if you can budget it then your night you're not wasting money buying the new 3ds but if you're on a budget you're really trying to save money the normal 3ds will be fine yes and pokemon is never like a like a new system now or a new platform seller like there they are always they hold out on the previous platform all the way to the bitter end but they do things like with black and white too there were add-ons that worked with the 3ds that were not required to play the game it's just you could get like special pokemon and legendary pokemon and stuff if you did it that could transfer into your game so that kind of took advantage of the 3ds features but breed es was not required for black and white to you know x and y was the first game that required the 3ds which was three years after the 3ds and come out already get pokemon always holds on to the previous generation hardware until the very very last that it can Carter s rights in hey spj will Travis and the rest and whoever else I missed and then in parentheses sorry Logan you are awesome I've been listening to you Pokemon podcast for over four years now and I love every episode from peanut butter Bidoof stew wap zip to will's LA zip to wills yeah yeah I've stuck with you guys the whole time and I have never bothered listening to another single pokemon podcast on iTunes I discovered you guys on itune brand loyal brands here I first discovered you guys out not on itunes but on amazon actually i was one of the few people that subscribed to the dollar a month kindle feed of your website's news from there I learned about the podcast and I've been hooked ever since you guys make me laugh numerous times and Travis is my favorite co-host whoo funny slay a funny story I'm not really on social media so I've never seen a picture of any of the host face besides Steve's I will my social my my Twitter picture is just a weird bird house anyway so you're not really missing it there so I'm not gonna closed I have been building up a mental image of Travis in my head until the episode where your time sorry to disappoint in the in the episode where you talked about 3d movies Travis said that he wore glasses I was stunned for real anyways keep up the great work I can't wait to hear your next episode Carter from Ohio p.s SBJ my first shiny was a gold duck mm-hmm so I think one of the most confusing things for me about Travis's appearance is um when I first met him he had short hair and now he just has like tremendous copious amounts of lengthy hair progress is about her Tropius amounts of lengthy hair like just like he's gone full hippie ya have it feels good I would I could I can relate to this email a lot and Thank You Carter for writing in but when I listen I listen to quite a bit of podcast and I always tried to form I'm an image of the said voices I hear and then when I do finally like reach out and discover what they look like it's always disappointing no I know I had that I had that happen with Jesse thorn I like had this image in my head that he was like super sartorial and well quaffed and everything and then you see a picture of him and he looks like somebody who's gonna punch you outside of a biker bar I guess always goes nothing with his appearance I think Josie Thorne is as a handsome gentleman albeit different than you would expect him to be just hearing his voice and some but different I I i would say sometimes the appearance is not what I expect but for the most time it it holds up and it kind of gives you a better I don't know connection to the host that urn that you know what they look like and and usually if I go out and I I look see what they look like I probably like the show quite a bit to figure that out whereas if there's there some podcasts where I don't ever go to their website I don't ever follow their Twitter I don't ever review them like I just listened and then you know can hope for the best and but there are a couple podcast where like I follow everyone on the podcast on Twitter I follow the podcast I like their facebook i go to the right like and everyone listening is like well I don't do that at all for it's super effective so I guess the question we have to ask is Alexa who are America's most handsome podcasters Alexa who is America's Next Top Model downhill down hill pod rights in Todd are hey SBJ relatively new listener here I'm 29 and just got back into pokemon and found your podcast is a has everything I wanted Oh probably it's super effective but I got oh he's got us confused with it's super effective about um you know just presence is that you would put on yourself to just her yeah yeah to confuse people about how you're actually a feeling it's super effective is everything I wanted just want to let you know just wanted let you guys know you do an awesome job thanks no I ain't that I'm gonna butcher this name I'm gonna spell it out for you guys maybe you can help me before I butcher it and CH you y le are wait that's your brother's name is I mean for the you in there and a CH and a CH it's still Skyler so scholar I've never seen the scholar spelled like that I've seen scholar I heaven yes k y le are yeah but Travis you know the sky cool river by Philadelphia um nope I don't you know geographies oh well that's why we have yon you're so much older and has more not that much older than you sir yes you know that book learning geography SI h uy is pronounced Scott have never seen that spelled that's cool that's very cool hi SBJ I've been I have become a big fan of the show in the past few weeks my first pot cat my first podcast was actually the dungeons and dragon heights podcast and I've been listening lately since this podcast has got me interested in dungeons of Dragon Knights and I've gotten a few my friends interested we are learning to play I thought I heard Greg said though there was something about a posting of his dungeon master notes online I have not been able to find them and I was wondering if you would be able to send me a PDF or a word document or just make the link available on the Internet if you could that would be great thank you for your amazing podcast I hope to hear for you from you thanks Guyler I yes we are what do we just finish Travis episode 70 date thanks evan is right i think seven is right so we're we're so estimating 12 episodes with that being said I I have most of the files but not all of the files but i do plan on putting them all on pokemon podcast calm as well as sending them directly to patreon backers yeah just keep your eyes peeled for that I think a lot now that we're so far into the campaign I think everything's kind of ironed out for the most Martin like especially with my character which was a little more custom things weren't really ironed out to like episode 3 and 4 with with moves and stuff so yeah just keep keep your eyes posted but yes a lot of people have been asking for those and we do / and I'm providing all that stuff to you guys free online on the internets so that that trademark uh soon soon TM Caleb rights in here hey SBJ will Travis Logan Micah and many other people that I've missed I started listening to the podcast just before 199 after looking for a podcast that was talking about Pokemon super mystery dungeon I wanted to hear other's thoughts and I've been a faithful listener since as a big fan of Polk was opposed to all the heretical listeners that that don't think that I'm the best co-host as a big fan of Pokemon super mystery to put my mystery dungeon series as well as the pokemon ranger series i've played explores the sky super mystery dungeon shadows of Almia all of which I've enjoyed I'd like to hear what you guys would like to see in the series if another one was to be released I know that Travis likes pokemon mystery dungeon and I know will likes pokemon ranger i'm curious to hear your thoughts i also encourage travis to struggle through the beginning of pokemon super mystery dungeon i consider the entire time i spent playing that game was worth it even the beginning and then by the way i really recommend pokemon mystery dungeon series to everyone listening I know roguelikes and story games are loved by everyone but I think everyone should give it a try if you tried gates to infinity and didn't like it play one of the others by now I'm probably taking up a good chunk of the episode you are welcome so I'll close this email keep up the good work you guys are awesome and then puts a minecraft master is uh I believe that's a slack name I believe this is one of our slack listeners yeah mm-hmm maybe i will give super mystery dungeon another try once i get some time on my hands work slowing down a little bit so i might be able to i were to pick something to add to super mystery dungeon or something i would like to see in a future installment I don't know it's it's never been like this the specific because mr. dungeon 2 is my favorite of those and it was never that it was a specific mechanic that really what made me love that game as much as it was that was the first time other than Brett well other than the show I guess it was the first time that a Pokemon a piece of Pokemon media made a Pokemon really feel like a character or the personality and I realize that's partly due to because the fact that these Pokemon talk but I was just sort of blown away by the fact that it made me care about the characters and a Pokemon game I can't really pinpoint one thing that I would like to see cuz it's not necessarily the fact that the game is a roguelike that makes me like it as much as the fact that I just thought it the storytelling was really good so it's hard for me to pinpoint one mechanic but as long as it those games continue to be story focused i'll continue to be interested and i guess i have to get through the beginning of super mystery dungeon to see that but i don't know and for me for pokemon ranger i think i've said it before but I'm going to keep campaigning for this I would love to see a main series pokemon game that allows you to choose somewhere near the beginning whether you want to be a pokemon trainer or a pokemon ranger and then how you actually collect and manage your pokemon throughout the rest of the game is done using either that mechanic or the other and then also allow you to switch back and forth um so you can kind of have the experience of both without having to completely reset your game I just think that would be awesome like oh you're doing you're yourself you're a region that's somewhere like between a trainer region and a ranger region so that people like pick which they want to be in you know as their life path that'd be awesome it would be cool they've always and I mean its first one it was here and you say that I was like oh they would never do that but then again I'm thinking about how in each game they have progressively encouraged thee well I guess not really I guess it hit its peak in gen 3 but they always do sort of encourage the contest or musical or whatever variant of that is in each game so that so i mean the the ranger aspect of it could be a akin to that but a little more fleshed out so i guess it's not really out of the realm of possibility anything is possible with dreams and imagination and their pokemon that our dream ones like dark rye and moon chakra we have the input we got a bunch more emails but we'll save those for next week again if you want to write in spj a poke at pkmn casscom or pokémon podcast.com slash contact either way we'll get an email to myself let's move on to our pokemon of the week which is i know for sure we have not done before Agron the iron armor Pokemon Travis will have a move set here as I read some biology real slow because I need to make a move time I'll I've got something to say to after you do your biology biz okay stall stall stall it out stall it up there's a lot of big words his with us worries me the gouges on a grounds armor from previous battles are worn as mementos of the more wounds it has the more it has battled it claims a large mountain as its territory and fiercely defends it from trespassers if its environment is damaged by a flood or forest fire it will restore the area by bringing in topsoil and planting trees it burrows through the strongest of bedrock and digs tunnels as it searches for iron to eat its horns which it uses to dig through bedrock when seeking food grow a little longer at a time and can be used to determine its age like the rings on a tree when I said there's a lot of big words I was referring to topsoil head rock I you know I didn't even realize that Ron had a mega evolution Wow yep there's so many now it's hard to keep track um no I was gonna say that the first form Aaron Aaron whatever you want to call it um there is a competitive strategy that's not great but like called the fierce try Oh GFE are on that Aaron was known for where you put a focus sash on it you use the Move endeavor uh some other attack and R stands for Oh usually ratata sash endeavor quick attack Rattata is usually like it's usually a rattata well I mean it was originally a rattata but Aaron is a lot better for him yes basically what you do it with the focus sash you can get Aaron down to one health and then use endeavor and that means your enemy is down to one health and quick attack is okay for the next right to take off that one health point but with Aaron since its immune to sand storms and to poison you could actually have a sandstorm going and the sandstorm would take off that one last help HP from your enemy so that's just an entrance interesting trivia of Aaron now that's all the time I could go for I got some trivia if Travis needs more time I can I can I can go all right all right all right coo coo we can we can build well as long as you're gonna allow me to do the the mega evolution version of it yeah sure I mean if thats what i was the most viable a ground that's what we want to give to people the only only the finest of a groans um I forgot until making this set that mega Agron loses its the rock type of Agron so I was originally thinking oh heavy slam and stone edge for the stab but actually um it loses the rock typing when it mega evolves so we're just going to do well the items can be a great obviously the mega evolve and then the set is gonna be stealth rock heavy slam thunder wave and roar this is gonna be as you can tell i primarily defensive set biz therefore playing off Agron strengths you're only going to do this if you have another Pokemon that's putting down some other type of hazard because just Stealth Rock isn't enough to justify the war placement there so if you're not running other pokemon with spikes or sticky web or toxic spikes then instead of roar you could do stealth rock heavy slam thunder wave and an earthquake perhaps and then 4 v's will do 252 HP and because its defense is already astronomically high at two-thirty will invest in special defense to make it to provide some other hits 0 2 52 in a a special defense as well the way you're going to use this set is you'll have another Pokemon set up your other entry hazard you'll bring in mega agron twice agron if you haven't mega evolved it yet but you'll bring an agron to take a hit and then you'll set up stealth rocks hopefully it'll be able to do that I mean given how much bulk it has it will most likely be able to and if it's able to take another hit you can start um start using roar to get free damage on all these Pokemon let's switch in and impose some disadvantageous switches for your opponent thunder wave is in there just because it's nice to have a status effect that you can throw out when you're expecting a switch in maybe to a sweeper that would be disabled by by something like thunder wave and then heavy slim is in there just because the base attack even if we're not investing at the base attack of my gag rounds 1-40 so nothing to shake it and especially considering how heavy mega agron is that heavy slam can hit pretty hard so that's about the gist of it this is obese ability what's not I said he or she I suppose has a sweet ability okay filter filter is pretty cool yeah reduces super effective damaged by one for a move that would deal times to damage wouldn't ste instead deal 1.5 times damage and a move that would deal times for damage would deal instead three times damage then that really helps with one of three pokemon that know it that really helps with the bulk too because you know even if you so you're you're unlikely to switch right if your opponent has like a fire-type pokemon out so you would be unlikely to switch into my guy ground in that case but let's say you're against like a pokemon the nose flamethrower that is not a fire-type pokemon you switch into mega a ground thinking you're gonna be ok because it's nothing because its type isn't super effective against my gag Ron even if your opponent predicts a switch into mega agron it uses flamethrower because it's not getting the stab and its end I agron has filter it's not going to be as devastating as if it as if it didn't I mean it's not a huge reduction in damage but it's definitely significant agron is the only dueled duel type Pokemon to lose a type up on mega evolution you know so surprised said earlier mega a grad is the only Pierce type pure steel steel type pokémon only Michael Stipe Pokemon to ever frontman r am only pietersite pure luck ash pure steel type pokémon that is not genderless agron is the heaviest rock-type pokémon mega agron is tied with Shuckle and mega steelix for the highest based at defense of all pokemon omega agron is also tied with mega steelix for the highest single base set of all mega-evolved pokémon which i think in this case is defense and yeah not that much trivia a shiny a Grom is like a turquoise instead of a grey mm-hmm that's pretty nice I like that yeah it's not like that ugly green not that ugly ugly green well that's our show yeah that's that's everything Travis is at the
