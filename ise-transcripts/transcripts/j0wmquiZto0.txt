[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 443rd episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is will it is a wonderful time of year for staying at home and staying cozy and enjoying the types of things that you can do around the house how nice greg also here i am also here i am also i'm not really doing things around the house like i did that for two weeks i'm back to work that's a thing that i'm doing around the house again i guess is leaving it for work no because you're working at home i have to work from home yeah yeah my life is a nightmare no matter where i'm doing it right now so i prefer to just pretend it doesn't exist i mean my work suddenly became a nightmare because half my company retired so i've applied for a new job to fill one of the many vacant holes after the holiday massacre of retirement i'll i'll uh i'll write you a recommendation letter okay cool we don't have a lot of pokemon news today but we will still feel three to four hours but strap on in because we got at least four hours of something to cover look it's after last week's proving that we'll go back in time literally nothing is off the shelf anymore there are no rails there are no guidelines you have no luck [Music] this 1998 advertisement from kentucky fried chicken for pokemon plushies that we need to go in depth look because they were beanie babies so they have value in two markets in this 2000 cartoon mew is clearly looking at this tree which is telling us that some cinna remakes are coming with better treats last week's episode was not the first time we've covered an old article before it wasn't like it was like this revolutionary brand new thing we've done on this show yeah but twice is a pattern no i think that was like the fourth time we've done an old article now we're in the weeds nobody can know stress yeah it's like a once a year occurrence but we might bump into twice a year you never know you never know no one's asking you pokemon company keep up with good timely news articles or we're gonna start digging into your past and seeing what we can uncover some people like the older stuff it's almost speaking of uh probably wait closer until february 12th february 12th i think because uh that would be the one year anniversary of pokemon home i got my hay in in a month we're going to renew your 1699 and i'm yes sweating if i'm gonna do that i also got my email saying we're renewing your 16 90 no it's 15.99 whatever anyways well i guess we'll see if there's one more two more updates or anything else they're gonna do it's a one-year anniversary so maybe they'll give us a free pokemon at least [Laughter] anyways we have some pokemon news for the week not a lot we'll waste your time for sure absolutely let's start with the pokemon go news not a lot here [Music] the countdown to the sinnoh events are ara coming on tuesday january 12th from sunday january 17th local time tart wig chimchar piplup [Music] cranny dose cranium crania dose i think it's crazy i think it's actually based on a cranberry so that would be kranidos i think it is what it's a dinosaur it's not a crazy chat cranberries are the dinosaurs of

skateboarding on your cranium no you protect yourself a lot of career left in skateboarding does anyone actually use the word cranium though i feel like if somebody does i'd be like board game buddy i

pokemon to receive stardust a magnetic lure 15 ultra balls and then the hoenn event will start on june sorry not june well maybe uh january 19th so not a lot there i guess did you guys finish your unova week no now i'll tell you why sitting at my home for the first time in months a blitzel appeared i used a raspberry three times three great curveballs did any of them catch no did it run away after the third yes did i say well that wraps up my unova celebration i sure did shut it off and walked away you gotta use the the silver golden i yeah i only use silver pineapples at all look it's a blitzel three great throws three curve balls and a raspberry oh dang i had the blitzel the only thing i'm missing is uh this is really sad i've never seen a ferrari ends in eight hours and 16 minutes yes i need a pharaoh seed and i need a herdier i guess evolving doesn't work you have to catch them in raids no i've i haven't heard of you in my house right now we'll send it over here to my house right now too we'll send it over here because i got nothing i completed this event and like what's this chimp chimchar get out of here he look he's a little early he didn't get the memo he doesn't know how to read a calendar i mean but you get you get an elite medal you do you do get a medal for completing the uh challenge oh this challenge is really easy i beat it like two hours and i'd even leave my house how did you get the herdier in their frost seed yeah they just appeared they have never appeared at my house ever i would have i do i didn't i didn't even use a um i didn't even use a lure not a lure sorry an incense an incense well i'm gonna get incensed right now because i've got 38 of those things and i'm i mean this is going to be like a six-hour show so you might as well stack them i mean stack them up i mean since the reward is a medal i could not care less here there the amount that of of interest i have in completing that to get a medal is less than none you get three thousand stardust that's pretty good do you know how much stardust i have not enough apparently i got more stardust than you all right let's all let's all brag about our stardust here wait i'm trying to catch this waltz right now i don't even know where to look you just go into pokemon and you tap any pokemon i've got four million six hundred and five thousand five hundred and fifty stardust right now it's telling me i'm going too fast when i'm literally sitting in front of this microphone i also have 337 about pokemon go greg geez once you get to 40 greg you're supposed to sign the contract like will and i did saying you love pokemon go and then they give you the good spawns am not a fool who's gonna sign away my precious rights at level 40. i mean they showed up and i read it and i said this is what those two signed are you kidding dude no there's a there's an oshawott raid right over here by my house why don't we stop recording and i'm going to go do that in fact i have 8 700 and hundred and 872 one stardust noob i'm at two point one million i've like i've got double what steve well because i never used stars i spent i've spent mine for like go battle league and stuff i mean i've leveled some pokemon that's about it yeah i bet will hasn't leveled up any pokemon why would i level up a pokemon so you're so you're so you can be the person in raids yelling at other people for using sub-optimal pokemon apparently there's a genesect nearby my house but i don't recognize the location so i have some ups and downs i like the catch tracker i think it's cool it gives you a reason to catch like a hurtier i i like how i checked it off but why why is it so limited why is drillburn not on the list i have four drillbar in my house right now why is this truck gilbert why is rubbish not on the list why is wrong wait where else is this gen 3 nevermind nor that way i i revised my previous statement i have actually caught none of these i just had the pictures of them which i thought meant i caught them well you have eight hours or six hours hours you can do it in oshawa right now it's really easy i'm just so confused why there's not an hour that i don't see a drill burr why is drillburn not on the list because it's too easy yeah like i have a time pole in my house too why is time pulling on the list what's the i believe that's tim paul thank you i think you're right i think i think it is temple for the drum thank you very much so i like it it's fine it means a whole week yeah it's a collector's thing you're over there i mean i'm way you know i'm way past that so you you legitimately sound like me when i was in high school when everybody else in my class like the day before an assignment would was due where it's like i i haven't done my essay yet i don't know what i'm gonna do and i'm like they gave us a whole week to do this there's things we care about and things we don't care about education came first i never wrote an essay until the night it was due i mean i went to design school so i didn't have to write essays i went to design school for high school i went to theater art i mean i got my degree in theater arts so to not ever have to write a paper again guess the drawbacks of studying war at georgetown university lots and lots of writing i mean i also for my job don't write until much closer to the due date like i my whole process of writing is terrible and i understand it but it works for me and also catching pokemon and pokemon go yeah well they need to show up and stay in the ball i mean it's a game about i don't know i was gonna say about going outside and exploring which i guess is still true you can go outside safely greg no because it's really slippery out there uh it got up to 32 today yeah which means it melts and then it freezes yeah it's a little icy over here too nobody wants pikachu you're so tired dude okay last bit of pokemon go news here is well there's more but we're going to skip a lot of it i mean i mean like they rescheduled some raids and stuff oh but the last last bit of news here is the north face and gucci collaboration which we've talked about collaborations before i don't this whole thing is really frustrating not in the sense of i don't really care that much about not who like the collaboration itself doesn't bother me in a sense of like the pokemon company partner with mr donuts in japan for chancy donuts and the pokemon company has partnered with uh long champ or whatever however will says it and those are like designer 800 purses that i will never buy i mean the pokemon company pokemon go niantic whatever they partnered with starbucks i can't even remember last time i went to a starbucks like four years ago where you get your coffee from i don't drink coffee collectivo i don't know who you oh that's true colectivo is pretty good i preferred it when it was alteria more pokemon altaria i'll talk again i can't even remember i could just think alterion that's what it used to be called altera that's what it was uh are you sure i think so it sure is get out the 3ds i'm pretty sure it's atari but they don't have coffee shops here's a list of billboards if i get one more oshawa i'm putting this thing down this collab is just i mean i'm not losing sleep over it it's just no it's just dumb it's dumb okay it's dumb there's a couple there's there's a number of dumb things within this dumb thing that they're doing so it says north face and gucci pokemon go discover hashtag the north face and gucci okay but let's stop right there i'm already getting distracted does gucci own north face or does north face no it's a couple web it's a collab it's a collaboration okay so so there's three collabs here yeah it's a triple this is it's like when girl skateboards collabs with sanrio they don't neither one owns the other but they're just like girl skateboards is using sanrio characters on their skateboards that's it yeah but that's two people this is three people it's just just because they happen to make an appearance in pokemon go doesn't make it three people what if you could get a sanrio girl skateboard in pokemon go it's the same thing okay that's true i see i see gucci and north face did a real like fashion launch like collaboration like those two companies did do a thing yeah you could legit buy these clothes yeah like that's a thing they already like they're not the same company but they did a fashion collab and i would argue that it's ugly but this is just then pokemon saying let's get in on that you already did a thing so let's do another thing with it okay so it says discover north face gucci collection in pokemon go with avatar items designed from the lines of t-shirts hats and backpacks as a gift to the community who may not be experienced this collaboration due to local restrictions you can redeem the avatar code using uh it's okay so it's like a it's like a long code here i'm sure you've probably seen it on social media and then inside your go app before originally they said you can only get this shirt backpack hat by going to a gucci store or a north face store i think there was like a hundred locations you could go through throughout the world and there was like four in california one in seattle like two in new york there was like two in chicago and that was closest to me was chicago i don't know you guys don't have a gucci or no face well we i like i have a northwest store in milwaukee we have a north face store at the mall of america we have one in the mall of america do you know if it changed the gucci one wait how long does this run for cause i'll go down there no you just you can just use the code now you don't have to yeah so like two days after they said 100 pokestops in the world yeah then they just gave a code to everyone because people because people were rightly like why are you making why are you making exclusive things that people have to travel for right now it was not a good look i'm just a little annoyed that it's like literally no pokemon theme to it at all like i understand because face slogan is never stop exploring which kind of goes in line with pokemon go but other outside of that there's nothing yeah so i i follow a lot of people who work at the pokemon company on twitter pokemon company got them north face jackets for their christmas present and i will say north face jackets are really nice yes they are and on the north face jacket was like a little it was really subtle it was just like a it was just like pikachu's head no that i would want it was a really clean looking jacket and so when they announced the gucci pokemon go north face i was like oh like they're probably going to do a couple jackets maybe some gloves but it's just this shirt and this hat and this backpack and they have nothing to do with pokemon yes and they're kind of ugly and i'm sure the backpacks like twenty thousand dollars and the hat is probably like ten thousand dollars and the shirt is probably like eight hundred dollars because gucci's on it [Laughter] i wonder how much they actually are i mean north face isn't cheap on its own yeah i know that's why i was like kind of excited because i don't have an amazing winter jacket and i was like you know what i've heard amazing things about north face i know they're a little bit pricier but if it has a subtle pikachu on it i'm in i'll i'll split i'll treat my i'll treat myself to christmas but they didn't do anything it's just this dumb gucci shirt it's a bit of a bummer yeah at least like the long champ stuff looked cool i know i couldn't afford it nor was i in the market for a purse but at least it was like a really cool looking purse yeah it's it's a weird i don't know it's weird like this one is just there's just nothing pokemon about it and also i think they picked the least attractive options from the collab like there's a cute jacket in there and that's not even an option you just get the weird t-shirt you don't even get the boots and then again before they release the code it was like really this is you're limiting it to the to your stores and you're not even all of your stores because there's a gucci and a north face store in mall of america so i would have had a direct i i considered driving to get these ugly clothes because i just like collecting things in pokemon go so i was like well the nearest store to me is an hour away but that store is like 20 minutes away from a japanese grocery store that i could go to and i would need to stock up but there was the other thing with this event is there's no end date yeah so they didn't say like oh get your gucci stuff by february 7th or something so that was also hard to plan like do i need to go this weekend what if i plan to go in like two weeks is it still going to be available like there's just no details about this event besides like here's some ugly clothes good luck but whatever they made the code available to everyone so and we're talking about gucci and north face right now so i guess it worked in the sense of they wanted us to talk about it i mean at least the release dates for the gucci stuff like the last thing they'll go online on january 22nd so i imagine it's through all of that like it's at least the month of january because that's when they're releasing everything all the actual products that they created there's still no prices that i can see yeah if you need to ask the price buddy you can't afford it well i know but i mean like one of my favorite expressions ever there's no prices on the menu well this isn't the place for you i would think they would at least have something to say this is what you're looking at price wise i mean to be fair looking at their regular things a pair of pants a thousand dollars so we're gonna say that they're they're around the thousand dollar mark i can i can probably honestly say i'm the only person in this conversation that has ever spent over a thousand dollars on a single article of clothing and a thousand dollars for a pair of pants is too much money oh yeah i have never spent that much money on a piece of clothing that i can think of i've come close like for jackets and stuff but never over a thousand dollars the only uh pokemon masters news i got is there is a new login bonus um it looks like just seven days in a row you eventually if you log in all seven days you get 500 gems and then you get 40 skip tickets because we all know that everyone is very low on skip tickets skip ticket poor uh my you'll be happy to know that my poll unluck has continued i have gotten the only five star i've pulled off of all of these banners in four months is morty yeah funny why do you say that because uh i also have pulled two mortys and uh i spent full disclosure i am partnering with dna they sent me my stipend they do send me some free gems every month as part of their program i spent all those gems i went 20 000 gems on lily's banner i got no

year's event i've been using guzma and uh pidgeot in blue is it herbert braviary nate and bravery nate and braybeery i've those have been my uh boosted new year's friends to get me all the new year's cards that i still haven't spent that's all we have for masters sorry sorry uh hopefully you completed a stitch i think um isn't uh what's her face coming what's her face completed an entire shell thank you uh may is eventually coming right i mean after april yeah i thought so no not the month of may the character i mean be specific was that rumored was that officially it was rumored yeah because it was it was in the i should be clear that this was a date of mine um but the database is already in the game with somebody isn't she not enough if mae shows up without piplup i am going to riot no barry has pitbull yeah but i am going to write may is gen 3. you're thinking um dawn dawn is gentle okay okay uh the only gen three character missing is mudkip because trico is brendan and oh i'm thinking of snivy who in snivy what rosa has rosa that's what i was thinking of not me never mind yeah i think may is supposed to be like the last one of the data mine that hasn't come out yet we're gonna take a break we got some tcg news some new sets are coming out also there was a tcg arrest that we need to cover is it from the pokemon worlds in canada finally is this yo the continuation of your scam no no this is a different scam okay uh but we will be right back [Music] if you were a pie if you were a pie if i was pipe if you were a pie if you were a pie if i was a pipe a lemon

keep on enjoying the episode [Music] we are back from our break all right before we get to the good news uh two tcg things just came out there is a pokemon tcg alakazam v box uh that should be available on pokemon center should be available in like target in walmart and other stores is is what you would think but i believe people are still that tcg craze is still going but uh as of as of this recording it's still on pokemon center for 20 bucks and it's free shipping on pokemon center for 20 bucks the alakazam v box includes one promo card featuring alkenzamv one oversized card featuring alakazamv four booster packs and a code card for the online game see how many steam seizures in this box does it include a boss's orders no it's just four booster packs could it include a boss's orders in one of those booster packs boss's orders was rebel clash it looks like there's one rebel clash here i see two vivid voltage one rebel clash i think that's rubble clash in the background that other one might be darkness ablaze if i go to target tonight to get some groceries and they have pokemon packs what should i which pack set should i be looking for where's my what's my money set i would say your money set is vivid voltage right now with the big pica and then the second one i would probably say is darkness ablaze it would probably be an order of release like sword and shield is probably the least exciting of the sword and shield sets so i would probably say first vivid voltage second darkness ablaze third rebel clash fourth sword and shield all right so i'm buying more commander legends that's what that's what i'm hearing here okay unless they have a champion's path which has the two charizards that everyone wants but also champion's path is a scam don't get champion's path there's another tcg thing coming out on this is so the alex exam should already be out it said release date was january 8th this is pokemon tcg v battle deck venusaur vs blastoise this comes out on february 5th this comes with two ready to play v battle decks each has 60 cards each deck includes a po a powerful special pokemon either venusaur or blastoise eight additional trainer cards including two foils two large metallic coins two deck boxes two quick start guides two single-player mats six reference cards damage counters one guide to upgrading your deck and a code card for the online game i don't know how good these decks are uh there there is like the adp battle box i think it's called the battle box that you can buy and it gives you like zashian and adp it's actually like close to the final deck that people use at tournaments not 100 sure how well like venusaur and blastoise are not particularly like i wouldn't say they're tournament level at all um there is a little like step counter on this it's one out of three pokeballs and it says level one so i think this is just mostly for beginners i don't know i i don't know what the difference is between getting these two versus getting a theme deck first getting a battle box that's kind of the confusing thing yeah i don't know about the theme deck part but i would say like the the only point of these ones that i could think of is like if greg and i were going to go to brunch and we're like we need something to do while we're at brunch because it takes them a long time to serve the food and we're like well let's grab some pokemon decks and neither one of us plays the tcg so we don't have prepared decks correct so we could just grab one of these not sleeve it a shiver just went down my spine and we could throw it down with some pokemon fun right there well that's what a theme deck is already doing but also right i i i only have to buy one product here and i've got two decks versus buying like trust me parents of the world that out there that have no experience with pokemon they're buying a theme deck bringing it home and wondering why their kid has nothing that they can actually play okay we're correcting for that error ah there's no price on this either uh theme deck is like 14.99 so i i'm gonna guess that this is probably gonna be 25. there you go discount the good news this is off bulba garden bulbapedia used to be on top of news they don't do news as much anymore i think because they like force people to change roles because it's a wiki there's like some weird isn't that like a weird wiki rule like every two years you gotta wrote it rotate out somebody no idea never heard that before in my life but is this the article where pokemon tcg becomes more like yu-gi-oh no are you sure yes maybe i don't know uh this is by archaic we've had archaic on the show before they are the the big the big boss of uh bulba garden singapore police arrest pokemon trading card scammer yeah that's more like yugioh right there singapore police have announced they arrested a 28 year old man on suspicion of having cheated more than 15 victims of more than 176 000 singaporean dollars worth of pokemon cards greg quick what was that number again 176 000 singaporean dollars is this is this a made up word singaporean this is like alolan or glarion no i mean i would say singaporean and i my suspicion is that you are adding an extra syllable as you enjoy doing that's true all right what give me that number again 176 thousand i got it here i'm i'm quick on the clicky keys that's 132 714 dollars and 44 cents in united states dollars yep oh okay so over 100k yeah i mean singapore has a good economy so they got some value to their currency police started invest investigating uh after having received several reports from victims who claim they have been scanned by an online seller who had been advertising pokemon tcg cards at a discounted price only to become uncollectible after the victim transferred payments via bank direct bank transfers if found guilty the man faces uh imprisonment terms up to 10 years and a fine under section 420 of singapore penal code this is not the first time in recent memory that singapore police had to deal with pokemon tcg scam scammers back in october singapore arrested a 26 year old man and a 17 year old female teenager for their suspected involvement in a series of e-commerce scams involving the sales of pokemon cards on carousel a singaporean online auction platform oh so they're like ebay we can only hope that with the latest arrests singaporean police have now caught them all boy i hate that line singaporean police have reminded members of the public to be very careful when making online purchases using buyer protection avoiding advanced payments blah blah blah always use uh what is it called dagnabbit this is a business transaction not friends and family no matter how much they ask you to use friends and family oh i know what you're talking the paypal thing yup i mean how many it's like i i've been in the tcg world for eight years now and it's like if there is one refrain that you hear over and over again is if you don't know the person you're buying from don't use friends and family [Music] [Laughter] pay that little extra i've purchased a lot of uh tcg code card stuff off ebay i've never had a problem i suppose that if if somebody has never really used ebay they probably don't know what to look for uh like there's there's i mean the obvious thing is is just look for the little star next to their name to see how many like sales they've had and how many have gone good and how many have gone bad but you start to recognize like the same sellers over and over when you shop on ebay enough i don't know what i wonder what carousel looks like you could just be like me and never buy anything off ebay ebay is okay ooh carousel has a nice looking website i don't know ebay is the tick tock of online karmas commerce what ebay ebay is like i feel like [Laughter] i elon musk's pocket here i feel like no one under the age of 20 is actually using ebay anymore what are they using facebook marketplace uh bay we're just sad nobody uses facebook either that's true so is it are you saying that they just run it all through etsy now etsy you can't you can't resell stuff through etsy that you get commercials for what there's like a like listed or off it or something like that or bop it or twisted yeah there's definitely like dedicated craigslist there you go chris no one's using craigslist anymore are people usually died people use crazy people still use craigslist everybody just sells through linkedin now yeah i don't think that's happening i mean linkedin's gonna be used for something my career advancement obviously obviously i think you're probably more likely to buy something used off linkedin than to get a job on linkedin i don't think that's happening i mean ebay still seems to have a lot of things for sale on it yeah no i like ebay i i grew up with ebay though so it's a trusted partner of your life i don't know if i'd trust everything on ebay you can get like all 400 shinies and pokemon sword and shield for a solid like 40 on ebay if you're into that go on why are you wasting all this time on twitch where you could just spend 40. i ask myself this all the time i still think ebay is probably one of the best places to go to import like japanese goods i mean you could go to like well i used to use japan stuff but they they like closed because of the pandemic and then they like slowly reopened but they're not stocking new things they're only fulfilling things they had before the pandemic started which is like no one wants that old pokemon stuff we want the new stuff and then i guess you could go to like mecca but man the the amount of what's the word surplus price increase they put on things is unrealistic yeah it feels like sometimes you're paying almost double for an item just for them to ship it through dhl last bit of news here started with an arrest story let's end with an arrest story we started with an arrest story as the yugioh continues man arrested for forging prized popsicle sticks to win pokemon cards in japan this was sent in by brandon from our slack community a man was arrested for wednesday in eastern japan near tokyo for allegedly forging and sending out dozens of special popsicle sticks to an ice cream manufacturer so they could be redeemed for a popular pokemon by four popular pokemon cards by the company the 43 year old man is a suspected for attempting fraud after he sent 25 fake popsicle sticks in november la of last year's uh to akagi nayugyo ko in uh satamata prefecture according to local police i'm assuming that is the company that was making the said popsicles i'm sure it's the ice cream the company uh ran a competition between june and july of last year i think we covered this news actually i think so i think so yeah that sounds about right this sounds oddly familiar now the company ran a competition between june and july of last year which people could send in a rare lucky stick from its popular popsicle brand gary gary in exchange for pokemon game cards created for the event the limited sticks were engraved with the words you win a ghari pokemon card which could only be seen after consuming the ice cream uh akari kargi contacted the police after receiving multiple lucky popsicle sticks from what from what was believed to be one person the ice cream manufacturer warned consumers the possibility that fake lucky popsicle sticks are being sold online what does this world come to so this is just like the whole mcdonald's monopoly thing oh yeah oh yeah totally but like didn't wasn't the mcdonald's thing to win a million dollars and not get a bunch of cards hey you find value where you find it true do you think do you think he was he had like one of those wood burner sets that was like individually burning to forge i don't remember what the how the sticks whether it was like ink printed or burned into the popsicle stick but i mean it can't be that hard to forge a popsicle stick if it's ink printed there's your problem right there i mean that's just ripe for counterfeit hello i'm going to go to ebay real quick and see if i can [Laughter] see if i can find fake popsicle sticks no i wanted to see if like somebody won the card and then put it on ebay but it doesn't look like it it doesn't look like it's on ebay i don't know how many winners there were the guy made 25 sticks though that doesn't seem like a lot well if he did more than that it would be suspicious i mean you are at that point playing with they know how many sticks are out in the world and so like if they if they had like there are 12 popsicle sticks and they suddenly got 25. like you're busted at that point what do we have a picture of even what the card was yeah it's just this a root card that is in vivid voltage but there's like a there's like a small gold thing on top of it but it's just as a rude um 210 hp grass pokemon as a rude v card and there's just like a little symbol a gold symbol on it so i'm not sure if that's the final card but that's what's shown in the like what you could win picture um but nobody no one's listing it on ebay so but are anybody listing the popsicle sticks on ebay because i found an article from august that says why use pokemon pop 6 they're selling for hundreds of dollars i know no one told japan about the national decks oh right but they're good at using ebay or somebody in japan well i get a lot of things from japan via ebay as we just discussed in the last segment of this podcast and not not uh lister uh flipit.com or whatever oh is that maybe what the app is called flipping i don't know what it's called i'm literally making things up sell it chuck it sell it buy it i don't remember what the app is called i'm not seeing any japanese popsicle sticks on ebay i will type in the term japanese popsicle stick let's see where that gets us be careful young internet searcher uh it gave me a watermelon ice bar food plush pillow cushion from japan starting at 99 cents five days left five hours e berry is not the right place did you search for gary gary i did and nothing yeah i know how to use ebay do you yes i'm going to type i'm going to type i know you know i know you know how to to do that but i bought a copy of ebay for dummies 12 years ago and that book has never let me down i just searched for gary garcon card for just gary garcon and i got a pokemon card for 529.84 sets i searched for ice cream japanese and i found i'm not making this up ice space cream space japanese it's not the top 20. i had to scroll it down a little bit i found it though 883.55 uh i have a i have it here it does have the symbol as listed it's like a gold embossed symbol on it it's here it's 880 883 dollars i mean you're talking about the card right the card is yes i found cheaper ones the the least expensive one i found is 529 okay i'm seeing i see a 650 this is an actual picture of the card though i see the dude's hand in it yeah i see the actual well i see an actual picture of the card and the and the message from the company oh i found that one i found one for 4.90 oh that's buy that one the rude v promo collaboration hit the lottery winning card uh it has a certificate behind it with the gary gary guy i remember the karigari guy because he looks like a little monkey so there's one on here that's for 1 88 why why so much and why are 10 people watching it hold on i found you oh i found the ice cream stick now look okay burned or printed it looks wood burned see they did their best oh look there's one wait there's one here psa gem mint 10 for 2053 dollars yeah that's a lot i found a psa 10 no this is just psa 10 oh no this does have the uh it does have the symbol the gary gary symbol i i found it for 18. i just yeah i find the psa 10 what hold on i've gotten cheaper i've gotten cheaper we're down to 465. uh a picture of the card sleeved the certificate in the background for 200 i'll make a photocopy of the card and send you the photocopy okay but this dude does it this this certificate doesn't look like it's framed for for 30 more dollars here i can get the frame certificate and the card looks like it's in a top loader as well the other card didn't hasn't top loaded well thank goodness they're at least using a top loader some people don't i don't use top loaders but still back to my initial premise [Laughter] how how much extra money do you need in your life to be willing to spend two thousand dollars on a single trading card that's not even like competitive good well i mean how much is a wood burning set okay this is gonna tell us what the scam was at a certain point money you have too much money will and if i don't don't that sentence has never been spoken i do not have too much money please lawsuit give me more money thank you no i'm saying that like people have people who make people who hit a certain threshold are making sure pay higher taxes oh i'm sorry yes sure but they're making so much money consistently okay and if i if i was at that point in my life which will never happen because i decided to get into both twitch streaming and podcasting two of the least and tick tock and tick tock i've made zero sense um if i was on the other end of things where i had too much money you better believe i would be paying two thousand dollars for uh the rude card stamped with a monkey face golden thing only from japan because i searched ice cream japanese on ebay you better believe i i would be by ebay would be flourishing with money because i would be importing everything i could i would single-handedly keep ebay afloat where are you gonna put all this garbage in here 17 houses i own here it is i found out why this person did this you can buy 200 popsicle sticks for five dollars oh that's true because i could make little log cabins out of my popsicle stick collection and a wood burning kit for fifteen dollars so for twenty dollars you could make two thousand dollars per card on ebay nobody's buying that card for two thousand dollars that's true yeah well then we saw it for sale okay five hundred dollars that's still a lot of profit for very little work okay so greg i must say thank you because i was thinking of getting back into model rockets but now i'm just gonna buy popsicle sticks and go for it yeah okay the real question is how many winners of this ice cream was there because on ebay [Laughter] i am on i i am on the this is samurai sakura the ebay seller obviously clearly japanese based off two of the like english japanese words that all americans might know both samurai and sakura they have sold 392 things on ebay they have the little blue star which means 99.5 positive feedback whatever they're selling as a rude card with certificate the little monkey face stamp 490 this is the one i would probably buy if i had uh if 500 was pocket change to me it's not this is the this is the seller i would probably buy from not only do they have two cards available at 490 90 they have sold seven so far how did did they just like buy cards off other people to like that's possible what what is it a corner of the market yeah how did they get so many they had uh they enjoy they enjoy in as a way of celebration having these wonderful ice cream frozen treats what i don't understand now that you've made me open ebay on my computer and i will literally have to take my computer and throw it into the dumpster because it has been tainted the name of our new podcast what i don't what i understand what i don't understand is why there are also listings for pokemon card gary gary elected the rude i guess i'm that's zarud whatever envelope winning notice so not the actual card not the certificate but the envelope envelope that had the winning notice in it well maybe somebody got the card and they want the they want 560 us dollars do you know i could buy a north face jacket for 560 us dollars that would keep me much warmer than this envelope this wasn't this wasn't in our news but there's a um there was a another card that's going for quite a bit not not as much as it's a rude card it's it's a pikachu card um that was exclusive to 7-eleven in japan it's the it's the card that i actually wanted it's the cramer ant with the pikachu in its mouth although it's a pikachu card not a crammer rant card uh and what they did is they made this cramer ant box and they sold it at 7-elevens and the kramer amp box was 4 000 yen which comes to like i don't know like 35 or whatever uh and the box is it's like a it's a promotion for the movie it comes with the pikachu promo it says coco on it koko uh which is funny because sometimes the other promotions say coco and it came with like five booster packs two the booster packs were shiny star v and then to the booster packs were whatever their like version of darkness ablaze is and then it was like an older like uh i think it was ultra shiny though like our hidden fates their their ultra shiny set and that whole box which is like 40 or 4 000 yen in japan is going for like 300 on ebay i see one for 500 i see one for 360 365. 60. the card is the one i well i do like the box because the box is like pikachu and cramer ants it's like a cool box the card is what i really want but the card itself is going for like 150 150 to 200 yeah so i don't know if that card i don't know if that card this is the thing about pokemon cards is that card will stay valuable if they never print it in english but the second they printed in english no one will care about the japanese one anymore they'll want the english one uh i guess people in japan will care about the japanese one that's true yeah nobody listen to you anyways well i'll be starting our wood burning uh podcast real soon soon as my wood-burning kit arrives during this whole conversation greg ordered a bunch of popsicle sticks bunch of popsicle sticks award-burning kid i'm set we are going to engage in the classic minnesotan craft of popsicle stick cabin building with beautiful ornate wood burned embellishments yep find our work on ebay our ebay shop for one thousand dollars per popsicle stick log cabin minimum tune into our youtube channel that we'll be launching uh wood-burning friends i am sure there are millions of wood-burning channels i'm so confident of this but are there millions of wood-burning channels with will and greg no that's true making traditional handcrafted minnesotan popsicle stick log cabins no what i always wanted to do on youtube see i like doing things that i know it's funny for a man who has plenty of time to create tick tocks you have dreams about doing youtube go on no i do youtube look there's a youtube videos every monday wednesday friday peeking i believe there's a gentleman named jake who does youtube yeah i mean he's atrocious so no i get everything jake is really great at editing my stuff but we do have youtube stuff the there are not channels dedicated to wood burning that's this is a lie this is a lie you're not you're not searching the right thing just like i had to search japanese ice cream to find the root there are a bunch of people who put up videos of wood burning but not dedic like not a dedicated wood burning channel this is what i want to do because i this is what i've wanted to do but we'll never do so if you want to steal this you're more than welcome to because it'll never but you never do it because i don't have time and bad time i've already it's clearly a passion project i've already have passion products that don't pay the bills like this podcast and like twitch uh everything youtube everything i do already doesn't pay the bills so i don't need to add another thing anyways the thing i would want to do on youtube is a water review channel because no one is reviewing water but why because it's all from the tap no it all tastes different greg decides to taste different than aquafan tastes different than uh the smart water tastes different than core tasting this is this is the wine tasting fallacy you have believe that you taste things different exactly brought you five glasses of water unmarked and placed them in front of you and said point out which is which you would have no idea no way i would literally be able to tell which one is fiji which one is smart which one is dasani i eat easy it's all it's all a boot point because i have watched youtube videos of people drinking different waters and reviewing them so that's not true you're telling me my eyes have deceived me that annoying mother with her two children who was like absolutely convinced that if your water that you're drinking doesn't have the right ph balance it's going to destroy your innards that that was that was fully my imagination sounds like it yeah here's the important thing if anyone out there wants the will and greg minnesota log cabin christmas village 2021 put in your orders now because it takes a long time [Laughter] when you are finally fully living in this state steve i we are going to sit down and record this masterful water tasting thing we are going to do it and you're going to fail here's the secret and and greg i will go back to your wine tasting dealio the secret with all of this nonsense and it applies to coffee as well where they're like it has uh tones of nougat and elderberry sap and maple droppings they they only refer to things that nobody has ever tasted so you're not sure whether you actually taste it or not and you feel like a fool if you ask look i'm not i'm not i distinctly taste maple droppings in this water this is from the north this is clearly from the northern part of the americas where maple squirrels went free and the droppings go into these fresh streams i can tell after it's been sifted and strained and placed upon this bottle that yes this water is surely a vermont's finest naive water yes surely i'm not sipping on dasani being like yes i can i can't taste it don't you ever said you could taste yeah each one of them and tell them apart yeah i can't go back here's what you need to learn here's what you need to prepare yourself is don't ever drink water out of uh any water bottle that is clear you have to get the blue water bottles because the uh it filters out the blue light and then that breaks down the tubulars in the water which just ruins the flavor if you don't have those two blurs in there there's a hawaii water that is so good i can't remember what the company's called it might start with an h i think you know i do i get it a lot is that it's either uh i think it's kailua water maybe something like that that's not an h whenever i see it at central market it's in a blue bottle though it legitimately doesn't move you got it because you can't get you don't want those tuplers to break down correct i'm doing a search for blue hawaii and are you searching on ebay or i'm sure should i google there's a lot of ca oh i didn't know that was a kind of why ikea yeah yeah that's it that's a that's it it's like volcanic water it's a meaningless statement sir volcanoes are rock you are not drinking molten water no no no like okay fundamentals of earth science the entirety of the hawaiian islands is volcano there are volcanoes everywhere there's a volcano under yosemite park but not even that just like if you're getting water from hawaii it falls from the sky yes it goes to the soil where you're not getting it and then it filters through the volcanic rock that those islands are and then you get it into the aquifer it's all volcanic water that's the only kind of water hawaii knows how to make i'm not recovering from this start with the tublers don't let your tubelers break down don't because that's gonna really affect the maple drops you you will you will not have that aftertaste of fermented nougat if you're nougat really needs to bind to tubulars to really come to really be maple forward in your water it really goes to bind to those because our tongues are designed sp there's like a sixth one further back that's the tubular sentence scientists just discovered the tubular it's just right right there behind you mommy yes so when you're drinking water you need to hold it way back in your throat to really taste it bunching garbage tell water apart because my taste buds are more sophisticated you eat mcdonald's every day your taste buds are dead it keeps it it keeps my tongue at a a uh always ready to taste palette no it's like all i eat your taste buds 10 years ago said all we get is mush we might as well die we give up we give up we're never going to get anything tasty so we're done salt you're up because that's all all we're going to get for the rest of our lives i love salt burgers see you go i'm going to lace all your water with salt on the tasting all right great give us question of the week okay it's the start of the new year you know just what i want to hear so get my interest peaks so let's have the question the question of the week ah this one is from steven from our addict channel very long so we got we gotta we gotta cut this down 2021 marks the 25th anniversary of pokemon we're expecting many event distributions like we did in 2016 which was the 20th who's this we we as the i would assume the community yeah i'm not expecting many advent distributions don't include me in that group i guess i would i mean i am i expect them to do something my question is what have you done with all your event pokemon over the year they've listed uh all of theirs they've collected then they say i am very pleased on the nintendo switch these pokemon go straight to your box without the chance of soft resetting now they're happily living in one box so i could check them off in chronological order what have you done with your event pokemon from past games have you redeemed them all from your delivery man have you used them in your playthroughs or competitive are they still in your old games collecting dust or are there in your newer games or pokemon home looking forward to many events in 2021 i've only found one cartridge where i thought i had redeemed everything and hadn't and i've dumped all of them into bank slash home they aren't organized in any way they're just in there i mean same here collect toss it in the box and move on with my life there's only one person steve who creates special boxes to put them in yeah because my pokemon home is incredibly organized i'm still trying to figure out the point of that because it kind of just like organizes it on its own it's kind of like you like the whole google mentality of like don't organize anything because search will find it for you yeah i just um them in there i mean to be fair i generally collect them all in like when i put them in a box i usually put them in whatever game i got them in in the same box because that's the box that was open and then when i dump them into home and bank they're all clumped together but i've done no organization past that and i don't almost all the distributions have always come after i finished the game so i've never used them in a playthrough i've used so there was the the 2021 or sorry the 2016 pokemon the like year of what was that year of no 2018 was a year of legendary and then 2016 was year of mythical i have used the marsh shadow that was given out in oh yeah wasn't that good against it was good against mewtwo in sword and yeah yeah i used mine too for that one yeah so i busted i used my marshall there there was a there was like a one-off halloween event or something in ultrasound ultra moon where i think you could use marshadow because it was part of the spooky um so i used my marsh shadow there my marshall probably is like the one mythical that got the most used uh with the year of legendary stuff a lot of those legendaries for competitive and ultra sun ultra moon for the ultra cup um what is what is the oldest you have i think my oldest is 2012 mew from heart gold soul silver distribution is probably the oldest pokemon i have oh i i have no idea i don't know i mean i i went to all the mall tours maybe it's two 2010 throughout the beginning ones so i've collected a bunch i don't remember what was given at mall tour so i couldn't i'd have to look them up i have to go to syribi there were some i missed like i missed the mcdonald's hoopa but uh rochelle and are slack she was able to get me one because i missed that one um how did you miss that one of all with your mcdonald's fetish i think it was bk lounging that year i might have switched to burger king for that year that's true i think the one time i did try to go their wi-fi the one i went to the wi-fi didn't actually work or connect so i was like oh i'll just do it again and then i forgot when i went to the wi-fi was not great but i did do it in all four games i'm pretty sure sitting in the parking lot with my lights off like nobody look at me because i'm outside of a mcdonald's oh that was like me and gamestop but for me like the premise of this question is is just fundamentally flawed as it applies to my life because if i'm playing a pokemon game to play the game i'm not using mythicals or legendaries i'm not using anything that would have been a distribution if i'm playing competitive i i don't soft reset for competitive mythicals or legendaries i just borrow them from friends who did that i got a lot of water to taste in my life [Laughter] i don't have time to be soft resetting for distribution pokemon so i just borrow from somebody else so yeah my mythicals and legendaries from distributions go in a box never to be seen again i will sell them on ebay as part of my retirement they mean they're in my will so somebody's gonna be real nice to me and i'll i'll i'll give you the codes to all my pokemon that i've collected over my years yeah i would say most of my pokemon are in pokemon home i have a couple that are not like i i have uh i have like a celebi and a caldeo still in in black and white that i haven't moved but you're still using aren't you still using some back in those games for stuff yeah i'm still i'm still using them eventually they'll get moved up yeah i have to move i have so many things i got to move out of bank i just sort of got distracted as usual well what is our point oh we need to we need to just as a quick side note if a pseudo-odo falls but nobody around to hear it doesn't make a sound yes it will always make a sound our individual experiences don't change how the world works we need to get away from this individual bias nonsense things happen without you being there to witness them yes somebody's still making many people out of popsicle zeros yeah and you didn't hear about it until about 20 minutes ago but it still happened okay pokemon the week i was trying to buy time to find my notes but i literally broke nothing down well okay so i've got a lot of issues well we know but the responses i've received to this past week's pokemon of the week first off the first clue if you can remember my third wife's name this week's pokemon will be an easy guess for you what i i live in the united states in the late 20th century i realized there's a lot of wild stuff going on but what do you think my third wife's name would be that would be similar to lou naton or lou nala i mean i guess i guess i know a guy who's dating a girl named louisa and he calls her lou but come on are you serious when the third one is just like so much clearer you were clearly married to other is like please like if you don't understand a word that i say feel free to look it up in the dictionary because i said that it does not represent a diurnal cycle and guess what diurnal means day and night so if you're looking at lunatone and soul rock day and night if you're looking at new la luna luna day and night that's a no-no we're looking at something that's not day and night and then uh yeah i mean the other part people guessed all three but they just never picked out the right one but here's the other part that there are three pokemon that represent pretty much the same thing two of them are legendary and one is ordinary what do you got greg because i i know steve's researching water brands i have nothing my my my page is blank if i told you that my third wife's name was chris lee anderson and lee was spelled l-e-a lithia wow can't is that right [Music] [Laughter] it's cresselia it was worth it though [Laughter] christelia and darkrai are like quarter moon and new moon or no moon but when you think of chris sometimes you think of like day and night when you think of cresselia because it's the whole moon thing but it's not day and night when it's with darkrai sorry folks just like i was like seriously somebody was like oh it's lunatone i was like what do you think my wife's name that is similar to lunatone and i was like yes her name was lou naton yes uh louise natalie from south could have been natalie louise no i like how their trivia is prior to generation uh six christilia shape was an ant thanks yeah chris ellie is a weird like corocellia dar cry relationship's weird cursely is also 100 female well it's supposed to represent the lunar cycle but what's weird to me is just like and i also mentioned this in the clue is that cresselia is not the full moon she's a crescent moon or it's a crescent moon shuffle icon is very good shiny is decent i kind of like the shiny this is a noticeable shiny although the colors again change it gets lighter as we get later in the games it's another one that sort of had its colors changed i just think the 3ds didn't have that many colors to it because like if you look at chinese and let's go or certain shield they're better like everything in the 3ds just seems very muted and soft that's probably the 3d part of it which nobody uses all right well i turned that off hurt my eyes immediately i was like i can't see i'm old here we go this week's pokemon of the week get ready greg because i know this one's gonna hit you hard okay i received a complaint in the past week about the way that i pronounced the name of a certain pokemon the companion to unovas throw i was so concerned by this complaint that i asked people from my hometown if they also get called out for the way that they pronounce certain words and they all confirmed that they do this week's pokemon is not that pokemon although they share one of its types now if you have really been paying attention you will remember a bit of trivia i brought up about naming conventions for birds where one word is used for a certain class of birds in north america but that same word is used for a different class of birds in the rest of the world my accent also kicks in when i pronounce the rest of the world class of birds it rhymes with throws partner this week's pokemon is based on that type of bird the last thing you need to know to get this week's pokemon is the classic but now defunct team up of enzo amore and big cass their moniker was an homage to the way that i pronounce another word and they come from the world this pokemon is themed after that is not enough information for you please know that i once had an awesome dog that tossed chocolate sauce there you go and we can't we can when i'm around you and i fall into your accent you get mad at me no it's when people repeat words immediately after i say them that make me self-conscious but you say them so good yeah i always get that excuse oh it makes me so happy it does like we all we have here is the fact that we say beer with the hardest r that has ever happened uh and the and then i would try to semi through exactly i was like i would direct you to uh steve's wife because she's got the worst accent of anyone that those those good old midwestern o's don't you know we will be back next week you didn't announce what the year is oh we went through that entire nightmare on friday was it friday look i don't know what day it was that's when he returned to street and you haven't even announced it well that's because the it was gonna go on youtube first oh all right then i guess none of you are gonna know you will know next week what the year of pokemon was unless you were there what the pokemon of the year was pokemon of the year it was unless you i was there unless you were there helping the demise and the fall of what should have been pokemon of the year oh what should have been oh he is going to go on this save it for next week with your water tasting mouth uh we'll be back next week if you want to know what the pokemon of the year is going to be that'll probably be on youtube uh this coming friday youtube.com pkmencast
