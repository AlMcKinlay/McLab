episode of the Pokemon podcast item 586 (0:27 - 0:33)
59 (0:31 - 0:36)
597 would be my guess yes that would be (0:33 - 0:40)
it um definitely your first Christmas (0:36 - 0:43)
yes that's my first guess I'm your host (0:40 - 0:45)
Steve with me is (0:43 - 0:47)
Hannah I apparently know the episode (0:45 - 0:49)
number slightly (0:47 - 0:53)
more but yes I'm here uh it's it's near (0:49 - 0:56)
the end of the year it's (0:53 - 1:00)
wild yeah and uh we another Pokemon game (0:56 - 1:04)
in the the books uh (1:00 - 1:09)
no not quite yet uh Al's here yes it's (1:04 - 1:11)
not just nearly the end of the year this (1:09 - 1:13)
is the last episode of the Year unless (1:11 - 1:15)
you're releasing on Sunday next week (1:13 - 1:18)
Steve no yeah I guess I guess it would (1:15 - 1:21)
be it would be recording and releasing (1:18 - 1:24)
on Monday like always yeah so may we go (1:21 - 1:25)
we're going to make the last episode of (1:24 - 1:28)
the year the longest episode of the year (1:25 - 1:31)
right no I don't (1:28 - 1:35)
we can't we can't do more than last week (1:31 - 1:37)
everyone seemed to love it though it's (1:35 - 1:41)
yeah that I did not love the editing (1:37 - 1:43)
of I don't think they're going to (1:41 - 1:46)
announce another sevenstar raid tonight (1:43 - 1:48)
yes I think I think we're clear with (1:46 - 1:50)
that although the sevenstar iron bundle (1:48 - 1:54)
is very cute and thematic and fun um (1:50 - 1:56)
here's the deal uh there there is some (1:54 - 1:59)
Pokemon news here and there nothing like (1:56 - 2:00)
terribly important (1:59 - 2:04)
uh so this episode is what we said last (2:00 - 2:06)
week which is story based so if you have (2:04 - 2:10)
not finished the Indigo dis DLC here's (2:06 - 2:15)
your warning for that um also your (2:10 - 2:17)
warning that Hannah is probably going to (2:15 - 2:20)
dominate this episode I'm sure we can we (2:17 - 2:23)
can only hope uh (2:20 - 2:27)
but um yeah I think I I think before we (2:23 - 2:29)
get into it I have one thing I want to (2:27 - 2:31)
talk about last week I think Al wanted (2:29 - 2:34)
one thing to talk about last week mine (2:31 - 2:39)
is I I still am blown away about how (2:34 - 2:42)
much people love the Synchro machine it (2:39 - 2:45)
is still mindblowing to me that people (2:42 - 2:47)
like this and I have I have such a (2:45 - 2:50)
LoveHate relationship with it because I (2:47 - 2:54)
used it to knock out Deli bird outbreaks (2:50 - 2:58)
which my frustration is I can't use it (2:54 - 3:00)
anywhere else so it's like I need to (2:58 - 3:02)
pick Deli bird outbreaks in the (3:00 - 3:04)
terrarium to use (3:02 - 3:06)
it and then I realized when I was in (3:04 - 3:08)
then I was like okay this is great like (3:06 - 3:10)
if a shiny pops up it's okay because I'm (3:08 - 3:12)
still standing here because it's just an (3:10 - 3:15)
outbreak and I can get it done faster (3:12 - 3:17)
and then I realized also because you (3:15 - 3:18)
can't check your map you also can't (3:17 - 3:20)
check the timer on your (3:18 - 3:23)
sandwich which is just like another like (3:20 - 3:25)
just frustrating thing of like I'm (3:23 - 3:27)
having a good time with it let me just (3:25 - 3:29)
check how much time I have oh I I can't (3:27 - 3:31)
I have to like go out of it there's just (3:29 - 3:34)
so many little things that make like I I (3:31 - 3:36)
get the core concept of people being (3:34 - 3:38)
like I get to be my favorite Pokemon I (3:36 - 3:41)
understand I I crar an unite was one of (3:38 - 3:42)
the best things in the entire world for (3:41 - 3:44)
me because I could waddle around and (3:42 - 3:47)
Tippy tappy and shoot Aruda audas at (3:44 - 3:52)
people but the the amount of limitation (3:47 - 3:54)
like that you get in this machine is so (3:52 - 3:57)
frustrating because it's it is charming (3:54 - 4:01)
or it can be Charming I agree (3:57 - 4:03)
I think I was also using it for da bird (4:01 - 4:06)
raids um mainly because the shiny is so (4:03 - 4:09)
obvious that you can't just like miss it (4:06 - 4:10)
and also because I have enough shiny (4:09 - 4:12)
Deli Birds I don't really care about (4:10 - 4:15)
them like I you know I spent I spent (4:12 - 4:16)
yesterday doing it and got like five of (4:15 - 4:19)
them and I'm like I already had the one (4:16 - 4:21)
I needed right I don't need all these so (4:19 - 4:23)
I need to Pro someone suggested Wonder (4:21 - 4:25)
trading them tomorrow so I think I might (4:23 - 4:28)
do that um but yeah I was enjoying it (4:25 - 4:30)
for that but yeah it's like I really (4:28 - 4:33)
want to use it for more more hunts but (4:30 - 4:35)
the problem is that I don't trust my (4:33 - 4:38)
eyes enough for most shinies um (4:35 - 4:40)
especially like milkery last week I (4:38 - 4:42)
wasn't doing it for that and flab (4:40 - 4:43)
certainly wasn't doing it for that like (4:42 - 4:45)
it's just too too risky when those (4:43 - 4:48)
shinies are so hard to (4:45 - 4:51)
notice yeah no that's totally fair it's (4:48 - 4:54)
just a fun thing to do I still enjoy (4:51 - 4:55)
using it for (4:54 - 4:58)
BBQs but you can't see what the BBQs are (4:55 - 5:00)
that you're trying to do you just need (4:58 - 5:02)
to keep track and honestly that one (5:00 - 5:04)
shows up so often as long as I just keep (5:02 - 5:06)
doing it I figure I'm (5:04 - 5:07)
[Laughter] (5:06 - 5:10)
helping oh I see so you're doing it with (5:07 - 5:12)
um when you're doing it with other (5:10 - 5:13)
people yeah okay fair enough because (5:12 - 5:15)
then they do keep cycling around I guess (5:13 - 5:16)
you don't need to keep track of them I (5:15 - 5:19)
was doing it for BBQ's on my on my own (5:16 - 5:21)
and when you've only got three it's (5:19 - 5:23)
really hard to to to figure out which (5:21 - 5:24)
ones you (5:23 - 5:27)
have I I don't even know if you do a BBQ (5:24 - 5:28)
as like (5:27 - 5:31)
amarada you can't see it because you (5:28 - 5:33)
can't open up any menus but if you do it (5:31 - 5:35)
it should still pop up right that you (5:33 - 5:37)
did it I don't think it does it does (5:35 - 5:39)
when you complete it it still says (5:37 - 5:40)
completed but if you're doing it with a (5:39 - 5:43)
bunch of other people that is kind of (5:40 - 5:45)
constantly going so you just kind of (5:43 - 5:46)
have to keep track of how many you've (5:45 - 5:49)
knocked out yeah I noticed that the it (5:46 - 5:51)
so it's only showing three at a time and (5:49 - 5:54)
no matter how many you have done it will (5:51 - 5:55)
still take the same amount of time to (5:54 - 5:58)
show on the screen so that's why as as I (5:55 - 5:59)
mentioned last week that's why they're (5:58 - 6:01)
like constantly always there because (5:59 - 6:04)
it's all you need is someone to do four (6:01 - 6:05)
really quickly and then that's it you've (6:04 - 6:07)
got a backlog you're never going to see (6:05 - 6:09)
the end of the (6:07 - 6:09)
list yeah I uh made a video about (6:10 - 6:17)
the this is a good transition I made the (6:14 - 6:19)
a video about the item printer because (6:17 - 6:21)
people were weren't understanding how it (6:19 - 6:25)
works but the main purpose of that video (6:21 - 6:28)
because I'm sure every (6:25 - 6:30)
Pokemon content creator the sun made a (6:28 - 6:33)
video about the item printer uh the (6:30 - 6:34)
thing that I noticed that I didn't (6:33 - 6:36)
really see people were talking about is (6:34 - 6:37)
the different percentages of what a (6:36 - 6:40)
Pokemon is worth so like Deli bird was (6:37 - 6:42)
worth (6:40 - 6:45)
56 percentage I don't know like Deli (6:42 - 6:47)
Bird's livers like 56% you put two (6:45 - 6:49)
livers in boom you're like one that's (6:47 - 6:53)
one print job um so when I was doing the (6:49 - 6:55)
outbreaks for Deli bird I was like I (6:53 - 6:58)
don't even care to get to 60 I'm just (6:55 - 6:59)
going to clear the entire outbreak cuz I (6:58 - 7:01)
need the materials (6:59 - 7:03)
anyways and then I'll just move to the (7:01 - 7:06)
next outbreak like and then I'll just (7:03 - 7:08)
move to the next outbreak and if a shiny (7:06 - 7:10)
pops up great if it doesn't not that big (7:08 - 7:12)
of a deal should pop up because the (7:10 - 7:14)
shiny odds are pretty high but also I'm (7:12 - 7:17)
going to get a bunch of material and the (7:14 - 7:19)
next event coming which is the dragon (7:17 - 7:22)
New Year Dragon event it's like dadand (7:19 - 7:26)
Dratini and J I think um and they all (7:22 - 7:31)
have pretty high percentages as well so (7:26 - 7:33)
I I really like (7:31 - 7:36)
that certain Pokemon are worth certain (7:33 - 7:38)
things because it makes you just want to (7:36 - 7:39)
clear the outbreak regardless like (7:38 - 7:41)
there's like a bombarder outbreak I had (7:39 - 7:44)
and I I remember bombarder was being (7:41 - 7:46)
like good for that and that was my (7:44 - 7:48)
thought I was like I already have like a (7:46 - 7:49)
shiny bomber deer but also like I could (7:48 - 7:51)
just clear this outbreak if one pops up (7:49 - 7:53)
awesome if it doesn't like I have all (7:51 - 7:56)
this material and I'm very curious how (7:53 - 7:58)
many (7:56 - 8:00)
people never touched their material in (7:58 - 8:03)
like the last year they didn't make TMS (8:00 - 8:05)
they didn't sell it they like got (8:03 - 8:08)
addicted to the item finder just ripped (8:05 - 8:10)
through all of their material and then (8:08 - 8:12)
in terms their (8:10 - 8:15)
BP and now they're like in this like (8:12 - 8:18)
Loop of like oh I need to knock out (8:15 - 8:21)
Pokemon because I don't have any (8:18 - 8:23)
material to run the (8:21 - 8:25)
machine I think I mean first of all I (8:23 - 8:27)
need to apologize for my hate of the (8:25 - 8:29)
item printer uh like I wasn't thinking (8:27 - 8:32)
of it in terms of the indiv like the the (8:29 - 8:36)
the 0.1% to get the Pokeball is Pokéball (8:32 - 8:38)
L Lotto or whatever it's called is is (8:36 - 8:40)
per item so you actually get like (8:38 - 8:42)
roughly 1% for each time which is a much (8:40 - 8:44)
bigger percentage but anyway I've been (8:42 - 8:46)
enjoying doing that I think that what I (8:44 - 8:48)
like is you know we've talked before (8:46 - 8:50)
about when you have something where (8:48 - 8:51)
you're trying to grind out something (8:50 - 8:54)
giving you a secondary thing to do as (8:51 - 8:56)
well which is this is exactly what (8:54 - 8:58)
that's doing you can be shiny hunting (8:56 - 8:59)
while also Gathering the resources that (8:58 - 9:02)
you can then use for the item finder (8:59 - 9:05)
item finder item printer because call (9:02 - 9:08)
iter too can they stop reusing similar (9:05 - 9:12)
names um I struggle with words as it is (9:08 - 9:15)
thank you uh because before now it was (9:12 - 9:17)
like okay you can get these but what are (9:15 - 9:18)
you getting them for you're getting them (9:17 - 9:21)
for TMS and it's like well I use most (9:18 - 9:24)
TMS maybe twice like I'm not I'm not a (9:21 - 9:26)
competitive person obviously I'm doing (9:24 - 9:28)
the raids I'm enjoying the raids but (9:26 - 9:29)
there's only so many Pokémon you can (9:28 - 9:32)
actually build for those and this gives (9:29 - 9:33)
you something that it really doesn't (9:32 - 9:34)
matter which one you have as well you (9:33 - 9:36)
can use it for that that's what I really (9:34 - 9:38)
like cuz yeah just now obviously I'm (9:36 - 9:39)
focusing on delibird and I'll be (9:38 - 9:41)
focusing on dadon next time mainly (9:39 - 9:42)
because I don't have the shiny but also (9:41 - 9:44)
because of the high percentage but it (9:42 - 9:46)
also means that no matter which one (9:44 - 9:47)
you're doing even if it was only worth (9:46 - 9:52)
9% you still if you if you you hunt that (9:47 - 9:53)
Pokemon you're going to get hundreds of (9:52 - 9:55)
them you know you're going to it's going (9:53 - 9:56)
to be really useful for the item printer (9:55 - 10:00)
no matter what it is yeah there was a um (9:56 - 10:04)
the cafeteria there's uh for 50 BP I (10:00 - 10:05)
think it's like the (10:04 - 10:08)
pizza I love the the American cafeteria (10:05 - 10:10)
food that they did it's like item drop (10:08 - 10:13)
level two and then it's um title level (10:10 - 10:16)
one so that's what I did for Deli bird I (10:13 - 10:17)
was like I don't like I don't want to (10:16 - 10:18)
use a nurb mystica I don't want to make (10:17 - 10:21)
a sandwich I'm just going to buy the (10:18 - 10:24)
item drop two because like my main goal (10:21 - 10:27)
was to get more Deli bird feet to like (10:24 - 10:29)
grind into the Miss Del Bird's an easy (10:27 - 10:32)
one it's Fe it's presence presence yeah (10:29 - 10:34)
I've spent so long trying to come up (10:32 - 10:36)
with an alternate theory for Pokémon go (10:34 - 10:38)
that's not grinding Pokemon up into (10:36 - 10:40)
candy and now you're just here talking (10:38 - 10:43)
about Jang moo livers but they but they (10:40 - 10:45)
are like some of them are like I don't (10:43 - 10:47)
think any of them are the insides of (10:45 - 10:50)
them like some of them are like fur and (10:47 - 10:52)
stuff like that there might be as close (10:50 - 10:56)
as like beaks is probably the (10:52 - 10:58)
most dodgy on there are some that are (10:56 - 11:01)
there are some that are a little iy yeah (10:58 - 11:03)
but there are no internal organs not a (11:01 - 11:06)
single one is an internal organ Steve (11:03 - 11:09)
the best B was on your video for the for (11:06 - 11:10)
the item printer stuff is you were (11:09 - 11:13)
saying like Deli bird livers or whatever (11:10 - 11:15)
while it was showing on the screen Deli (11:13 - 11:16)
bird presence it was literally on the (11:15 - 11:19)
screen (11:16 - 11:19)
Steve I I think I think the the item (11:20 - 11:26)
printer is great and I at first I was (11:23 - 11:28)
actually I didn't I don't think I said I (11:26 - 11:30)
I don't think I said this last (11:28 - 11:33)
at first I thought I was going to be (11:30 - 11:35)
like okay I don't want to be the I don't (11:33 - 11:36)
want to be the guy that's like (11:35 - 11:40)
everything is like shinies are too hard (11:36 - 11:41)
or shinies are too easy but I think (11:40 - 11:44)
there is like a a balance and it did (11:41 - 11:47)
kind of feel like man this machine is so (11:44 - 11:49)
good at just giving you money and giving (11:47 - 11:52)
you apricorn balls or or master balls or (11:49 - 11:55)
whatever or Safari balls but really I (11:52 - 11:58)
think I am (11:55 - 12:00)
biased because because I play the game (11:58 - 12:02)
so much and because I just had so much (12:00 - 12:04)
material like I haven't run out yet and (12:02 - 12:07)
like I can I can keep going but I think (12:04 - 12:08)
for the average (12:07 - 12:10)
player and when I say average player I (12:08 - 12:12)
don't think anyone listening to this (12:10 - 12:13)
podcast is an average player I think (12:12 - 12:14)
people listening to this podcast are (12:13 - 12:16)
above average players for the record but (12:14 - 12:19)
I think for the average player who (12:16 - 12:22)
like came back to the DLC going to play (12:19 - 12:24)
it for maybe a week or two then move on (12:22 - 12:25)
to a different game which is like (12:24 - 12:27)
totally cool I don't think they can sit (12:25 - 12:30)
there for like two hours and just grind (12:27 - 12:33)
that machine nor would they want unless (12:30 - 12:36)
like or if they or if they do start (12:33 - 12:39)
grinding for TMS they can like come back (12:36 - 12:41)
oh yeah go ahead I haven't worked that (12:39 - 12:44)
hard for TMS and I was still able to (12:41 - 12:46)
upgrade the entire thing all the way up (12:44 - 12:49)
to the master ball level with just happy (12:46 - 12:51)
materials and I know that I have never (12:49 - 12:54)
once or I am I am fairly confident that (12:51 - 12:56)
I have never once farmed happen (12:54 - 12:58)
materials and I don't make that many TMS (12:56 - 13:00)
and I would was very surprised that I (12:58 - 13:03)
had enough in there to just upgrade the (13:00 - 13:04)
whole thing and then keep going with (13:03 - 13:06)
everything else I already had so you get (13:04 - 13:09)
them fairly easily even if you (13:06 - 13:13)
don't uh go for it all the time for TMS (13:09 - 13:15)
I think the I I honestly like I was (13:13 - 13:16)
complaining about it last week but I (13:15 - 13:18)
think they've hit a really nice balance (13:16 - 13:22)
right because um as I you know as I said (13:18 - 13:24)
like it's it's integrated with another (13:22 - 13:27)
aspect of the game but also so I was (13:24 - 13:29)
doing roughly like 10 prints at a time (13:27 - 13:32)
so that's 100 items and I was I was (13:29 - 13:34)
getting roughly one kind of like (13:32 - 13:36)
Pokeball thing (13:34 - 13:39)
every each of those times I did it so (13:36 - 13:41)
like roughly one in 10 and then each (13:39 - 13:42)
time of those I was roughly getting (13:41 - 13:44)
about two apricot Botts that doesn't (13:42 - 13:46)
feel like an insane number that feels (13:44 - 13:48)
like a good number that feels like you (13:46 - 13:50)
can actually go and spend some time to (13:48 - 13:52)
build them up and use them for stuff but (13:50 - 13:53)
they're not if people really want them (13:52 - 13:56)
to still be kind of like semi- rare like (13:53 - 13:57)
it still does that right you actually (13:56 - 13:59)
have to put in that effort and in in (13:57 - 14:01)
terms of like the money thing I think by (13:59 - 14:03)
the time you're at this point in the (14:01 - 14:05)
game you've played through the whole (14:03 - 14:07)
game you've played through the first DLC (14:05 - 14:09)
you've now played through at least some (14:07 - 14:11)
of the second DLC before you can unlock (14:09 - 14:12)
it and if you get to the master ball (14:11 - 14:15)
you've played the entire DLC like I feel (14:12 - 14:16)
like you should be able to get money (14:15 - 14:18)
pretty easily by that point right and if (14:16 - 14:21)
you really want to get money quickly you (14:18 - 14:24)
can do that by going to the the the um (14:21 - 14:26)
the tournament you can just they've set (14:24 - 14:28)
it up again so you can just as spam (14:26 - 14:29)
through that so if you a turbo (14:28 - 14:31)
controller you can essentially get (14:29 - 14:33)
infinite money so I I itter might (14:31 - 14:36)
actually be faster possibly (14:33 - 14:40)
but a turbo control I think it is but (14:36 - 14:41)
the tournament also gets harder once (14:40 - 14:44)
you've completed the Indigo disc yeah (14:41 - 14:46)
and I haven't tested since then to see I (14:44 - 14:48)
think it was faster to walk around (14:46 - 14:50)
kakami to pick up items than it was to (14:48 - 14:51)
go through the tournament cuz you're (14:50 - 14:53)
like picking up like rare bones and like (14:51 - 14:55)
Comet chards that's true they are def (14:53 - 14:58)
rub bear like I like I I I guess I would (14:55 - 15:00)
have to like (14:58 - 15:02)
time out well I guess you could (15:00 - 15:04)
literally look up how much you would get (15:02 - 15:05)
from the tournament it's the same it's (15:04 - 15:08)
like 19,000 every battle or (15:05 - 15:10)
something I can't remember uh but then (15:08 - 15:12)
like I've maxed out money so I'm not (15:10 - 15:15)
doing it just now right use that same (15:12 - 15:17)
amount of time to like pick up items off (15:15 - 15:18)
kakami what is that if use that same (15:17 - 15:21)
amount of time but obviously you would (15:18 - 15:23)
have to do it a couple times to then get (15:21 - 15:25)
an average to then compare it because (15:23 - 15:30)
anyways I I I I think I think the the (15:25 - 15:33)
loop they created is is really good and (15:30 - 15:36)
shout out to all the people who sold all (15:33 - 15:37)
of (15:36 - 15:41)
their Pokemon guts before this DLC came (15:37 - 15:43)
out and had nothing like you didn't (15:41 - 15:45)
really get that much money for selling (15:43 - 15:47)
that stuff but I know people did because (15:45 - 15:49)
they're like I'm never going to use well (15:47 - 15:50)
it was League points you got for them it (15:49 - 15:53)
wasn't actually money anyway oh yeah it (15:50 - 15:55)
was leak points and yeah leak points (15:53 - 15:58)
don't even matter in go disc at all no I (15:55 - 15:59)
think really the only thing you can do (15:58 - 16:00)
League points for that you can't use (15:59 - 16:05)
money for is TMS everything else is (16:00 - 16:07)
money or League (16:05 - 16:10)
points (16:07 - 16:10)
yeah also like there's no vending (16:11 - 16:16)
machines like in a of armor that we (16:13 - 16:18)
didn't talk about like you got (16:16 - 16:21)
discounted you got discounted vitamins (16:18 - 16:23)
from upgrade so in the aisle of armor (16:21 - 16:25)
you could upgrade the the the dojo and (16:23 - 16:26)
one of the upgrades in the dojo was to (16:25 - 16:28)
add the vitamin vending machines and (16:26 - 16:32)
they had like 25 like HP ups for like a (16:28 - 16:34)
discount like a significant discount (16:32 - 16:37)
okay and for a DLC that they were like (16:34 - 16:39)
Battle Academy Battle Focus I thought (16:37 - 16:42)
they would have a place to get discount (16:39 - 16:43)
vitamins where's the where's the (16:42 - 16:46)
pharmacy at Blueberry (16:43 - 16:48)
Academy instead you're just going in and (16:46 - 16:49)
you're having to pay for every single (16:48 - 16:51)
thing with the new currency you haven't (16:49 - 16:54)
had anywhere else in the game yeah well (16:51 - 16:55)
that's not the the the vending machines (16:54 - 16:57)
in are are money (16:55 - 16:59)
though (16:57 - 17:02)
in in the blueberry Academy Oh you mean (16:59 - 17:05)
Mach pretty certain they are yeah I (17:02 - 17:07)
don't think they're (17:05 - 17:10)
BP cuz you you're just buy balls I'm (17:07 - 17:12)
pretty sure they are BP because I'm (17:10 - 17:14)
pretty sure I checked and every single (17:12 - 17:16)
thing in blueberry Academy is is bought (17:14 - 17:19)
with BP I found that very (17:16 - 17:21)
interesting actually I can check right (17:19 - 17:25)
now yeah literally in front of one okay (17:21 - 17:27)
never mind I was wrong (17:25 - 17:30)
yes (17:27 - 17:31)
I was going to say because you you have (17:30 - 17:33)
to buy like a quick ball before you even (17:31 - 17:34)
or you don't have to buy a quick Ball (17:33 - 17:35)
but if you didn't have any pokeballs you (17:34 - 17:37)
had to buy like Pokéballs to do the (17:35 - 17:39)
first grimer or not grimer but the first (17:37 - 17:41)
like catch nool in Pokemon (17:39 - 17:44)
Mission yeah but you can you can make BP (17:41 - 17:46)
before (17:44 - 17:48)
that no I don't you can't make BP until (17:46 - 17:50)
Lacy until that mission is done then (17:48 - 17:53)
Lacy unlocks it for you okay yeah I mean (17:50 - 17:55)
you could go fly somewhere else balls (17:53 - 17:57)
but Nintendo really walked me through (17:55 - 18:00)
that (17:57 - 18:00)
um okay let's uh speaking of lacy (18:03 - 18:11)
speaking of uh the (18:06 - 18:13)
terrarium where where would you like to (18:11 - 18:16)
start Hannah this is your your segment (18:13 - 18:19)
where do you just want to go through the (18:16 - 18:20)
the story they present is there (18:19 - 18:23)
something standing out to you gosh okay (18:20 - 18:25)
so I I think I want to preface with the (18:23 - 18:28)
fact that the twitch streams I have been (18:25 - 18:30)
doing for the month before the Indigo (18:28 - 18:32)
disc came out were very story focused I (18:30 - 18:35)
spent a month going through and (18:32 - 18:37)
specifically focusing on the story of (18:35 - 18:41)
the main game the story of the first DLC (18:37 - 18:44)
leading up to the last one leading up to (18:41 - 18:46)
the Indigo disc imagining it would be (18:44 - 18:49)
this Grand Finale and I came out of the (18:46 - 18:53)
Indigo disc thinking that can't be (18:49 - 18:56)
it that's not the end (18:53 - 18:58)
right and I think that I just wanted (18:56 - 19:00)
talk through the entire story of the (18:58 - 19:02)
Indigo disc and also (19:00 - 19:05)
maybe point out the things that we think (19:02 - 19:08)
might be coming up in the epilog that (19:05 - 19:10)
was announced with the trailer this week (19:08 - 19:12)
I was going to say isn't the end the (19:10 - 19:15)
epilog that's why it's called an epilog (19:12 - 19:16)
well I mean an epilog is meant to be (19:15 - 19:19)
after the end isn't it it is meant to be (19:16 - 19:21)
after the end it's meant to be like (19:19 - 19:23)
additional story like I feel like when (19:21 - 19:25)
they say the end we should probably feel (19:23 - 19:26)
satisfied with that and the epilogue (19:25 - 19:29)
should be 5 years later well obviously (19:26 - 19:30)
not five years later right but that's (19:29 - 19:33)
what they do be worse after credit (19:30 - 19:35)
nothing could be worse than the Harry (19:33 - 19:36)
Potter epilog that was probably the (19:35 - 19:40)
worst epilog of all time let's name our (19:36 - 19:42)
children after eight characters that (19:40 - 19:44)
have just (19:42 - 19:47)
existed fair not surprised lots of bad (19:44 - 19:49)
things there all right yeah we don't (19:47 - 19:51)
need to go down that rabbit (19:49 - 19:54)
hole I could we could but I think it's a (19:51 - 19:57)
whole it's a different podcast Steve let (19:54 - 20:00)
it know would be known that epu sucks (19:57 - 20:04)
it's bad okay (20:00 - 20:08)
um uh yeah uh (20:04 - 20:12)
so we talked about the Elite 4 (20:08 - 20:16)
mechanically last week there is some (20:12 - 20:20)
Elite 4 story (20:16 - 20:20)
involvement and like I think they didn't (20:20 - 20:25)
here's what I'll say and I I don't know (20:23 - 20:30)
if Hannah agrees or disagrees I felt (20:25 - 20:33)
like the story of the Indigo disc was (20:30 - 20:36)
like when you go to a movie's Wikipedia (20:33 - 20:40)
and you just read it and you're like yep (20:36 - 20:42)
that whole movie makes (20:40 - 20:45)
sense like it felt like the Indigo disc (20:42 - 20:47)
made sense everything from start to (20:45 - 20:50)
finish was like oh I under I understand (20:47 - 20:52)
the story you are telling you are giving (20:50 - 20:55)
no fluff or filler you are (20:52 - 20:59)
like here's the next like bullet point (20:55 - 21:01)
we have to hit off the Wikipedia which I (20:59 - 21:04)
don't think is bad by any means I I I (21:01 - 21:08)
was surprised because Hannah and I sat (21:04 - 21:11)
on the show and we were like there's so (21:08 - 21:13)
much that they need to tell (21:11 - 21:17)
us and they did kind of answer there's (21:13 - 21:18)
probably one or two questions that they (21:17 - 21:20)
really like maybe kind of glossed over (21:18 - 21:23)
but like they did kind of tackle (21:20 - 21:26)
everything in very like oh we're that (21:23 - 21:28)
okay okay I guess that's your that's (21:26 - 21:29)
your answer (21:28 - 21:32)
next bullet point please but it did feel (21:29 - 21:35)
very it didn't feel like rushed it just (21:32 - 21:36)
felt (21:35 - 21:41)
like we are simplifying this (21:36 - 21:45)
down and here you go like no filler (21:41 - 21:47)
there was maybe a little bit of filler a (21:45 - 21:48)
little bit of fluff in the fact that all (21:47 - 21:50)
the characters in the Indigo disc felt (21:48 - 21:54)
like anime character tropes and there (21:50 - 21:56)
were actually interactions between the (21:54 - 21:57)
characters there were relationships (21:56 - 21:59)
between the characters there were (21:57 - 22:00)
feelings between the characters (21:59 - 22:02)
introduced in the Indigo disc between (22:00 - 22:05)
all of the Elite Four they were clearly (22:02 - 22:08)
classmates who had relationships of A (22:05 - 22:10)
Sort or other they liked each other or (22:08 - 22:11)
they didn't like each other or they were (22:10 - 22:14)
annoyed by one another and that was neat (22:11 - 22:17)
but that wasn't really quite the same (22:14 - 22:19)
stories I was expecting to learn more (22:17 - 22:20)
from the stories I was expecting to (22:19 - 22:23)
learn more about really were kind of (22:20 - 22:27)
Wikipedia entry kind of (22:23 - 22:29)
thing (22:27 - 22:31)
I feel (22:29 - 22:34)
like the game really wanted the (22:31 - 22:37)
characters to have character arcs and so (22:34 - 22:38)
they wrote that they had character arcs (22:37 - 22:39)
but they didn't actually write the (22:38 - 22:42)
character arcs themselves so you see the (22:39 - 22:43)
beginning of the character Arc and you (22:42 - 22:44)
see the end of the character Arc but (22:43 - 22:46)
you're like but how did we actually get (22:44 - 22:49)
from there to there you know like if you (22:46 - 22:51)
take like kieran's ending for example (22:49 - 22:54)
right (22:51 - 22:54)
ending well okay ending within this (22:54 - 22:59)
story you (22:57 - 23:01)
it's like okay he's he's he's you know (22:59 - 23:02)
at this point where you know he's (23:01 - 23:04)
clearly been hurt by us in the previous (23:02 - 23:06)
story he's clearly having some trouble (23:04 - 23:09)
he's trying to like make himself big and (23:06 - 23:10)
strong because that's going to fix (23:09 - 23:12)
everything apparently and then it's kind (23:10 - 23:14)
of the same for most of the story and (23:12 - 23:16)
then right at the end he's like oh (23:14 - 23:18)
you've done the exact same thing we did (23:16 - 23:19)
in the last one you defeated me and then (23:18 - 23:21)
you caught the Pokemon I wanted oh I (23:19 - 23:23)
guess everything's fine can we go back (23:21 - 23:24)
to being friends like there wasn't (23:23 - 23:27)
really any substance there with that (23:24 - 23:29)
you're just like there's I see where (23:27 - 23:32)
they wanted them to go but why there are (23:29 - 23:34)
moments that I'm hoping they're going to (23:32 - 23:39)
maybe expand on a little bit more so I (23:34 - 23:40)
if we want to talk about the Elite 4 (23:39 - 23:41)
first we can talk about the Elite 4 (23:40 - 23:43)
first but I've spent I think at least 20 (23:41 - 23:46)
hours thinking purely about (23:43 - 23:49)
Kieran yeah I think I think Kieran is (23:46 - 23:55)
like the highlight of the stories (23:49 - 23:58)
um I for the Elite 4 like the only I (23:55 - 23:59)
guess the two characters that stand up (23:58 - 24:02)
for me for the Elite 4 are Drayton who (23:59 - 24:05)
is I think I think one of the coolest (24:02 - 24:08)
characters in the entire (24:05 - 24:10)
franchise (24:08 - 24:12)
um and I I think I'm a little (24:10 - 24:15)
disappointed (24:12 - 24:15)
that like every character had like (24:16 - 24:21)
pretty much a closing Arc and Drayton (24:19 - 24:23)
didn't really (24:21 - 24:26)
close like you you feel like it's going (24:23 - 24:30)
to close like Drayton comes off so what (24:26 - 24:33)
I like about Drayton is that he's like (24:30 - 24:37)
this lazy like Millennial energy like (24:33 - 24:40)
I'm like like like I'm successful but (24:37 - 24:43)
I'm also like lazy but like I'm I'm I'm (24:40 - 24:45)
like Everyone likes me but also there's (24:43 - 24:47)
like a few people that don't really like (24:45 - 24:51)
me like it's it's really relatable um I (24:47 - 24:53)
think to at least me and when when (24:51 - 24:59)
Carmine is like don't trust him he's a (24:53 - 25:03)
jerk but like to you your character you (24:59 - 25:05)
holding the controller he seems awesome (25:03 - 25:06)
like he's super friendly to you he's (25:05 - 25:08)
really welcoming he wants you to join (25:06 - 25:10)
the League and then at some point in (25:08 - 25:12)
that story like there's I can't remember (25:10 - 25:14)
what character says like you just you (25:12 - 25:17)
cannot trust Drayton he's up to (25:14 - 25:19)
something but like again like the energy (25:17 - 25:21)
he's just giving you is like you're (25:19 - 25:24)
awesome glad you're here love you man (25:21 - 25:28)
let's get lunch again and and then at (25:24 - 25:30)
the end when Kieran (25:28 - 25:33)
loses you can you can see it you you (25:30 - 25:36)
it's like it's like how you're like if (25:33 - 25:38)
you were on a date with somebody and (25:36 - 25:39)
you're having like a really really great (25:38 - 25:42)
time every everything's good and then (25:39 - 25:45)
you go to dinner and then all of a (25:42 - 25:48)
sudden your date is super rude to the (25:45 - 25:51)
waiter and you're like oh my gosh I now (25:48 - 25:53)
see what everyone was saying like I had (25:51 - 25:54)
such a good time and now you're like I (25:53 - 25:56)
have this like ick that you're like (25:54 - 25:59)
super rude and dismissive to the way and (25:56 - 26:00)
just to check you're you're talking (25:59 - 26:02)
about the moment where he goes up and (26:00 - 26:04)
and says to Kieran how was it ex (26:02 - 26:08)
Champion yeah yeah it was so cool when (26:04 - 26:11)
he said that cuz it was so petty so like (26:08 - 26:13)
you f like you go through this whole (26:11 - 26:15)
like Elite 4 and you see that Arc of (26:13 - 26:18)
like oh now my character is personally (26:15 - 26:21)
seeing Drayton be this like bad guy that (26:18 - 26:23)
everyone was warning me about and he (26:21 - 26:25)
does that in front of Kieran and you're (26:23 - 26:28)
like oh here it comes but that's kind of (26:25 - 26:30)
like the end of that story yeah yeah (26:28 - 26:32)
they don't expand on that there's no (26:30 - 26:35)
payoff to be like what was his motives (26:32 - 26:39)
besides like I want Kieran to lose I (26:35 - 26:41)
think I mean I feel like most of his (26:39 - 26:44)
motives were almost wanting to help a (26:41 - 26:46)
friend that's how I felt for most of the (26:44 - 26:50)
time though also question have either of (26:46 - 26:53)
you done any of the post story stuff in (26:50 - 26:54)
the club room with all of the characters (26:53 - 26:57)
in there because I know there's more (26:54 - 27:01)
story there I also haven't done (26:57 - 27:03)
it but there is more story there I know (27:01 - 27:06)
the first thing you uh hear from drton (27:03 - 27:08)
when you go in there post credits post (27:06 - 27:10)
story all of that is rton saying that uh (27:08 - 27:13)
Kieran hasn't apologized to him yet (27:10 - 27:16)
basically Kieran hasn't hasn't really (27:13 - 27:19)
talked to him yet he's just gone and (27:16 - 27:21)
disappeared (27:19 - 27:24)
so yeah no I I haven't done any of the (27:21 - 27:27)
post stuff I heard that it's very long (27:24 - 27:29)
if want to go through cuz it's like 18 (27:27 - 27:32)
people and like three battles each yep (27:29 - 27:34)
yeah I'm looking forward to it but it's (27:32 - 27:36)
very also it's not double battles which (27:34 - 27:39)
is really (27:36 - 27:41)
weird I didn't realize there was any (27:39 - 27:44)
Story related to the the blueberry (27:41 - 27:46)
Academy people I assumed because I've (27:44 - 27:47)
seen some of the stuff with the gym (27:46 - 27:50)
leaders and the teachers from from Pala (27:47 - 27:51)
but I didn't realize there was stuff (27:50 - 27:53)
stuff for the blue I'll have to look (27:51 - 27:54)
into that because I I've done all my (27:53 - 27:56)
other BP stuff right I've spent (27:54 - 27:58)
everything else so that's all I've got (27:56 - 28:02)
BP for now yep except the item printer (27:58 - 28:03)
always need more bp for the item printer (28:02 - 28:05)
yeah true but it's (28:03 - 28:08)
cheap but yeah no I I was always kind of (28:05 - 28:09)
weirded out by the fact that other (28:08 - 28:12)
people were saying that dren was up to (28:09 - 28:14)
something because he really just seems (28:12 - 28:17)
like he wants to help (28:14 - 28:20)
Kieran (28:17 - 28:25)
stop uh being so hard on himself and (28:20 - 28:26)
everyone around (28:25 - 28:31)
him that's what Drayton seems to object (28:26 - 28:33)
to (28:31 - 28:36)
yeah and there was that biting moment at (28:33 - 28:38)
the end where he calls Kieran ex (28:36 - 28:41)
Champion but even that it's kind of just (28:38 - 28:43)
that one little bit I don't feel like (28:41 - 28:44)
that's him (28:43 - 28:48)
revealing anything I feel like I don't (28:44 - 28:52)
know like I said for for me the the the (28:48 - 28:54)
closest I could compare it to was just (28:52 - 28:57)
like your date being rude to like a (28:54 - 28:59)
somebody in like the workforce whether (28:57 - 29:01)
that's like a cashier or waiter or (28:59 - 29:04)
something and you're just like ah that (29:01 - 29:08)
that was a little jarring um yeah I (29:04 - 29:09)
think that's a little bit weird what I (29:08 - 29:11)
did notice about him as well is did you (29:09 - 29:15)
notice his catchphrase for (29:11 - 29:18)
you it's champ in the making he calls (29:15 - 29:20)
you champ in the making which is what (29:18 - 29:22)
the the guy at the start of the gyms in (29:20 - 29:25)
gen one says he (29:22 - 29:29)
calls which I thought was a nice touch (29:25 - 29:32)
yeah no that is that is really cool I (29:29 - 29:35)
will say uh not really Story related but (29:32 - 29:38)
lore rib related in Pokemon I liked the (29:35 - 29:39)
we're jumping all over the place that's (29:38 - 29:41)
fine I figured that was going to happen (29:39 - 29:45)
I liked when um after Kieran (29:41 - 29:48)
loses uh Drayton is like okay well you (29:45 - 29:51)
get to move down the ranks and you're (29:48 - 29:53)
like the number two trainer now which (29:51 - 29:54)
means I'm the number three which means (29:53 - 29:57)
krisen is like out of the Elite 4 and (29:54 - 30:01)
Crispen is like no like it was just kind (29:57 - 30:03)
of cool to see that like like openly (30:01 - 30:06)
talked about of like hey we actually (30:03 - 30:09)
have a structure in our like Elite 4 (30:06 - 30:11)
like I'm sure all Elite 4S have (30:09 - 30:13)
structure but like they like openly talk (30:11 - 30:16)
about it it was just like it felt like (30:13 - 30:19)
more connected instead of like what the (30:16 - 30:21)
mess of like the X and Y Elite 4 was (30:19 - 30:23)
where you got there and like no one like (30:21 - 30:25)
had any connections and didn't make (30:23 - 30:27)
sense you could do them in any order (30:25 - 30:29)
like the only one that you saw prior was (30:27 - 30:33)
the team flare reporter on TV and then (30:29 - 30:34)
you battle them and you never think (30:33 - 30:37)
about them again or the or the son one (30:34 - 30:39)
where he's just like here's some people (30:37 - 30:41)
there you go I chose (30:39 - 30:44)
them you already fought these here's a (30:41 - 30:48)
girl with a two Cannon she used to (30:44 - 30:48)
golf I think the blueberry Elite Form (30:48 - 30:53)
might be able to make it a little bit (30:50 - 30:56)
more uh straightforward because they're (30:53 - 30:58)
a club and they don't necessar neily (30:56 - 31:00)
have to pay people for having the Elite (30:58 - 31:03)
4 as a job or at least that's how it is (31:00 - 31:04)
in (31:03 - 31:06)
Pala since Larry's apparently been (31:04 - 31:09)
working there for 20 years 25 25 years (31:06 - 31:11)
25 (31:09 - 31:13)
years so long no wonder he's tired (31:11 - 31:16)
that's a long (31:13 - 31:16)
time yeah I I thought (31:16 - 31:24)
um I thought chrispen was okay uh like I (31:20 - 31:27)
thought like I I I liked the very like (31:24 - 31:30)
little of his personality they shown um (31:27 - 31:33)
like I I did like pretty much pretty (31:30 - 31:36)
much every interaction with him um (31:33 - 31:39)
amoris was like (31:36 - 31:42)
fine I want to see more of amoris (31:39 - 31:43)
because I really feel like there's (31:42 - 31:45)
something there and her relationship (31:43 - 31:48)
with Kieran and with Carmine seems (31:45 - 31:49)
really interesting to me but they don't (31:48 - 31:52)
show very much of it yeah AR isn't she (31:49 - 31:55)
like they say at one point that she's (31:52 - 31:57)
like Carmine's best friend or they're (31:55 - 31:58)
like really close (31:57 - 31:59)
yeah she's Carmine's friend but she also (31:58 - 32:02)
seems to care about Kieran yeah she said (31:59 - 32:04)
she asked you who because I I redid this (32:02 - 32:05)
this morning she she asked you who (32:04 - 32:07)
Kieran is to you and you can either say (32:05 - 32:09)
a friend or or a rival and I don't (32:07 - 32:11)
actually know what it says if you say a (32:09 - 32:12)
rival but if you say a friend she says (32:11 - 32:16)
well to me he's my best friend's brother (32:12 - 32:17)
and then she talks about how she's (32:16 - 32:19)
worried about how he doesn't seem the (32:17 - 32:22)
same anymore and want to and her it's (32:19 - 32:24)
it's interesting people in Pokemon (32:22 - 32:25)
always fix things by battles right cuz (32:24 - 32:27)
she's like that's what I need I need to (32:25 - 32:29)
be the one to help him and that's why I (32:27 - 32:30)
need to defeat you in battle and you're (32:29 - 32:32)
like I'm not really sure I see the logic (32:30 - 32:35)
there but okay fine let's let's (32:32 - 32:37)
battle that's like the wrestling Trope (32:35 - 32:40)
in like just wrestling like if there's a (32:37 - 32:41)
problem in wrestling we got to go to the (32:40 - 32:43)
ring and solve it like that's that's the (32:41 - 32:45)
only solution and and then you defeat (32:43 - 32:46)
her and she's like oh well I guess (32:45 - 32:48)
you're the one to fix him don't lose to (32:46 - 32:51)
anyone else (32:48 - 32:54)
classic so I think she just struggles (32:51 - 32:56)
struggles with knowing how to show (32:54 - 32:59)
friendship I think (32:56 - 32:59)
well she has like that military (33:00 - 33:06)
background too right very like Stern or (33:01 - 33:08)
whatever that's the style of outfit at (33:06 - 33:09)
least I don't think that's implied (33:08 - 33:12)
anywhere else oh I I thought it was I (33:09 - 33:14)
thought it was like with like the (33:12 - 33:16)
stopwatch and like the the stand how she (33:14 - 33:21)
stands and true okay little little (33:16 - 33:25)
things yeah no I I thought she got like (33:21 - 33:29)
like fresh out of boot camp or something (33:25 - 33:29)
um and then like the most interesting (33:30 - 33:34)
thing about Lacy isn't even like lacy (33:31 - 33:35)
it's like the most interesting thing is (33:34 - 33:37)
like she's the daughter of clay which is (33:35 - 33:40)
like revealed to you in like those (33:37 - 33:43)
League battles like it's not even reveal (33:40 - 33:45)
to you in (33:43 - 33:47)
the when you're going through the (33:45 - 33:48)
initial (33:47 - 33:53)
story it's mentioned isn't it it's (33:48 - 33:56)
mentioned that uh her dad like it's (33:53 - 33:57)
mentioned that her dad is a gym leader (33:56 - 34:01)
yeah but like the actual like Lacy's dad (33:57 - 34:03)
is Clay isn't even said by Lacy it's (34:01 - 34:07)
said by um it's either like claval or (34:03 - 34:10)
sarino like they say it to you that her (34:07 - 34:12)
they like they confirm her dad is Clay (34:10 - 34:13)
but (34:12 - 34:16)
like I I think most people could put if (34:13 - 34:17)
you play Gen 5 and you're like in her (34:16 - 34:19)
area and you're hearing like the drif (34:17 - 34:20)
music and then like she sends out an (34:19 - 34:23)
Excadrill like you're like okay I got it (34:20 - 34:26)
they don't look as close as closely (34:23 - 34:28)
related as other Pokemon (34:26 - 34:30)
distant relatives tend (34:28 - 34:33)
to but they have the same gemstone on (34:30 - 34:38)
their hats and hair clips yeah yeah but (34:33 - 34:41)
also like nowhere in two games of black (34:38 - 34:43)
and white and black two white two I (34:41 - 34:45)
don't think they ever mention clay has a (34:43 - 34:46)
daughter which is like fine we don't (34:45 - 34:48)
know where this is timeline wise right (34:46 - 34:50)
if we want to get into (34:48 - 34:54)
that yes like this could be you (34:50 - 34:57)
know what she's probably what early (34:54 - 35:00)
teens at most so this could be he could (34:57 - 35:03)
she might not have existed back (35:00 - 35:06)
then yeah I need to look up on what the (35:03 - 35:08)
current theories are for the timeline (35:06 - 35:10)
they're (35:08 - 35:12)
insane because there's only there's only (35:10 - 35:14)
a few confirmed things and the rest is (35:12 - 35:17)
just like assumed based on you see celby (35:14 - 35:20)
went here and then Hoopa went (35:17 - 35:23)
there although there's also a dialogue (35:20 - 35:26)
that talks about how Drayton is related (35:23 - 35:27)
to dren (35:26 - 35:30)
the gym leader oh did they confirm gr (35:27 - 35:33)
grandson I think yeah that is also I (35:30 - 35:35)
believe confirmed in (35:33 - 35:40)
the BBQ or not the BBQ the the the the (35:35 - 35:42)
the league club battles or whatever yeah (35:40 - 35:45)
yes the club room (35:42 - 35:48)
stuff one thing I found interesting (35:45 - 35:51)
storytelling wise is so much of the (35:48 - 35:54)
lower of these well the three of the (35:51 - 35:56)
four Elite members are is just told do (35:54 - 35:58)
you by Dron like he just comes up after (35:56 - 35:59)
your battles and he's like oh yeah this (35:58 - 36:01)
person this is this is their their whole (35:59 - 36:06)
deal and you're like okay great thanks (36:01 - 36:06)
narrator he just he he reads Everybody (36:07 - 36:11)
really well and he has to tell you about (36:09 - 36:15)
that I didn't mind that as as much (36:11 - 36:17)
because it just gave him like more (36:15 - 36:19)
personality like if if their goal was (36:17 - 36:21)
like ah we want to really focus on this (36:19 - 36:22)
guy and the other three are not that (36:21 - 36:26)
important like yeah it it gives big (36:22 - 36:28)
Lance energy I'm not saying it's bad I (36:26 - 36:30)
just found it funny I was like just as (36:28 - 36:32)
like a personality thing I just love the (36:30 - 36:34)
fact that he must tell everybody about (36:32 - 36:36)
everybody (36:34 - 36:36)
else if you need to know about someone (36:37 - 36:41)
Drayton (36:39 - 36:45)
knows yeah um and I think the the (36:41 - 36:48)
obvious after the Elite 4 (36:45 - 36:52)
is the Kieran stuff which kind of pushes (36:48 - 36:55)
the final bit of the story because like (36:52 - 36:56)
are we like missing anything before we (36:55 - 36:59)
get to Kieran I mean like it's kind of (36:56 - 37:02)
like you do that opening battle with (36:59 - 37:05)
Carmine you see Kieran for the first (37:02 - 37:07)
time then it's pretty much like battle (37:05 - 37:09)
the Elite 4 take your time whatever (37:07 - 37:11)
order you (37:09 - 37:13)
want and then you get to the actual cure (37:11 - 37:16)
and stuff like yeah I was shocked how (37:13 - 37:20)
like oh there's nothing else I can just (37:16 - 37:23)
battle oh like which is totally fine (37:20 - 37:24)
which is probably great like I I think (37:23 - 37:27)
pacing wise is really great they pretty (37:24 - 37:29)
much (37:27 - 37:32)
like we here's the intro to the Indigo (37:29 - 37:35)
disc now you can do whatever you want (37:32 - 37:37)
and if you want to just get the story (37:35 - 37:39)
done just do it there's no like busy (37:37 - 37:42)
work you have to do just pick your Elite (37:39 - 37:44)
4 and then you're off to go or just get (37:42 - 37:48)
distracted and do whatever so I I think (37:44 - 37:50)
at least for me pacing wise was they did (37:48 - 37:52)
a really good job at giving you the (37:50 - 37:55)
freedom but also giving you like exactly (37:52 - 37:57)
where you want to go if you want to move (37:55 - 38:00)
this (37:57 - 38:00)
along yeah I feel like the pacing worked (38:00 - 38:05)
really well I also liked how there were (38:02 - 38:08)
Side characters NPCs you could talk to (38:05 - 38:09)
if you wanted to learn more about kind (38:08 - 38:11)
of what was going on about how the (38:09 - 38:13)
characters were interacting because I (38:11 - 38:15)
did talk to a few of those because some (38:13 - 38:18)
of them did have things to say about (38:15 - 38:19)
well (38:18 - 38:22)
Kieran and about everything that was (38:19 - 38:25)
going on at the school at the (38:22 - 38:29)
time it feels like this expansion is (38:25 - 38:32)
like the Pokemon masters (38:29 - 38:36)
of the games where like their focus is (38:32 - 38:39)
on like characters and their backgrounds (38:36 - 38:41)
and their information around them (38:39 - 38:42)
because there's a lot of that in Masters (38:41 - 38:43)
isn't there it's like the whole point of (38:42 - 38:45)
that is you meet people and they tell (38:43 - 38:46)
you things that you wouldn't have known (38:45 - 38:48)
elsewhere and it's kind of the same (38:46 - 38:50)
thing here and you know we can I'm sure (38:48 - 38:53)
we're about to talk about the actual you (38:50 - 38:54)
know big story of that but I feel like (38:53 - 38:56)
that stuff works really well it's like (38:54 - 39:00)
espe especially with the the league club (38:56 - 39:01)
stuff later on you know it's the same (39:00 - 39:02)
sort of stuff it's like hey invite this (39:01 - 39:04)
person here and invite this person and (39:02 - 39:06)
you'll get some story and that sort of (39:04 - 39:09)
stuff uh yeah I do like that yeah (39:06 - 39:11)
actually especially with the league club (39:09 - 39:13)
stuff at the end that really does feel (39:11 - 39:15)
like Masters in some (39:13 - 39:19)
ways it's kind of wild well let's uh (39:15 - 39:20)
take a break real quick and then when we (39:19 - 39:24)
get back we can talk about Kieran and (39:20 - 39:26)
the tree that didn't actually matter and (39:24 - 39:28)
then the the (39:26 - 39:33)
hallway uh I forgot about the (39:28 - 39:33)
tree sword and shield haters didn't (39:34 - 39:40)
forget about the (39:37 - 39:40)
tree all right we'll be right (39:40 - 39:47)
back and we are back from our (39:43 - 39:49)
break (39:47 - 39:52)
um uh so you know in the in the teal (39:49 - 39:56)
mask I said I I liked where they were (39:52 - 39:58)
going going with Kieran I liked how he (39:56 - 40:02)
was like this Tim timid (39:58 - 40:06)
shy wower little (40:02 - 40:10)
kid uh and then I I liked (40:06 - 40:10)
how I liked how they built him up to (40:11 - 40:16)
become like pretty jaded uh and you know (40:13 - 40:20)
some people didn't really agree with how (40:16 - 40:21)
they did that in the (40:20 - 40:24)
story but like you (40:21 - 40:27)
know to me it was like okay that (40:24 - 40:29)
those are the points they want to hit to (40:27 - 40:32)
make this kid become like somebody who (40:29 - 40:35)
despises you and I I did I did like that (40:32 - 40:40)
um and it was cool to me to (40:35 - 40:44)
see what they built up uh in in this DLC (40:40 - 40:46)
of (40:44 - 40:49)
like I I I don't want to say like we (40:46 - 40:51)
finally got a mean rival because like (40:49 - 40:54)
we've had we've had gladon we've had (40:51 - 40:58)
bead um we've had (40:54 - 41:02)
Avery we've had like Clarissa I guess (40:58 - 41:04)
and we have (41:02 - 41:06)
Carmine yeah Carmine which was supposed (41:04 - 41:09)
to do the flip of Kieran of going from (41:06 - 41:14)
like Angry Rude mean to like (41:09 - 41:14)
sweet um or like Hugh like Hugh was also (41:15 - 41:23)
like pretty rude and pretty um (41:20 - 41:25)
standoffish except he just wasn't to you (41:23 - 41:28)
he was just to everyone else (41:25 - 41:30)
um (41:28 - 41:32)
so I I don't know I guess if if people (41:30 - 41:34)
were really like I want to I want to I (41:32 - 41:37)
want to rival that's mean again like (41:34 - 41:39)
well I I kind of feel like at least this (41:37 - 41:41)
is the way I've been conceptualizing it (41:39 - 41:45)
Kieran isn't really a rival so much as (41:41 - 41:50)
he is a villain the issue that I took (41:45 - 41:52)
and that so many others took with the (41:50 - 41:54)
end of the teal mask was that what he (41:52 - 41:57)
does with ogrean there at the end is the (41:54 - 42:00)
actions of a Pokemon villain not of a (41:57 - 42:03)
rival he's trying to force a legendary (42:00 - 42:07)
Pokemon any Pokemon to come with him (42:03 - 42:09)
regardless of what the Pokemon wants (42:07 - 42:10)
that's the action of a villain that's (42:09 - 42:12)
not the action of a Pokemon Rival and I (42:10 - 42:15)
thought that that was really interesting (42:12 - 42:18)
and that that was kind of the the tricky (42:15 - 42:19)
part in that they were trying to make (42:18 - 42:22)
that turn from a character you supposed (42:19 - 42:25)
to sympathize with maybe even relate to (42:22 - 42:27)
into someone who's doing these things (42:25 - 42:31)
that are just not (42:27 - 42:34)
okay and I don't necessarily think they (42:31 - 42:37)
did that as well as they could (42:34 - 42:40)
have partially because of the order of (42:37 - 42:44)
things that I suspect because I have a (42:40 - 42:48)
lot of uh I have a lot of theories built (42:44 - 42:50)
up in my head we're going to maybe (42:48 - 42:53)
figure out more as time goes (42:50 - 42:53)
on yeah like I had and I talked about (42:54 - 43:00)
this off the podcast but like the the (42:57 - 43:03)
ogre paon incident very very much felt (43:00 - 43:07)
like uh uh Cyrus and gutina or Maxi and (43:03 - 43:10)
Archie and Kyogre Groudon um those three (43:07 - 43:13)
that I just named all failed at what (43:10 - 43:15)
they went out to do I guess like (43:13 - 43:18)
technically Archie and Maxi got Kyogre (43:15 - 43:20)
and Groudon except they like lost power (43:18 - 43:23)
like literally (43:20 - 43:25)
instantly but like the only one that (43:23 - 43:27)
like really succeeded (43:25 - 43:31)
did H well I guess like getus succeeded (43:27 - 43:34)
like getus succeeded in like getting (43:31 - 43:35)
either rammer (43:34 - 43:39)
kiram uh or rash Zam I guess like Kus (43:35 - 43:42)
isn't really a bad guy but he (43:39 - 43:46)
is and I guess he succeeded in (43:42 - 43:49)
Catching kir kierum but then like (43:46 - 43:51)
Giovani is like the probably the best (43:49 - 43:53)
example Giovani was like I want Mewtwo (43:51 - 43:55)
Mewtwo doesn't want to like work with me (43:53 - 43:56)
I'm going to put a bunch of armor on him (43:55 - 43:58)
and like you can't leave you're my (43:56 - 44:02)
Pokemon um so like I did get that like (43:58 - 44:05)
energy from Kieran of like I don't care (44:02 - 44:08)
what this Pokemon wants I just want them (44:05 - 44:11)
because they're a legendary Pokemon (44:08 - 44:14)
which is like the the standard Pokemon (44:11 - 44:16)
villain Trope of like what is the (44:14 - 44:19)
legendary Pokemon I would like it for (44:16 - 44:21)
myself and it's gone in an interesting (44:19 - 44:23)
it's it's gotten developed more with the (44:21 - 44:25)
indigo disc because at first it was I (44:23 - 44:27)
want ogre pond because ogre Pon is ogre (44:25 - 44:30)
Pon and I've had this connection with (44:27 - 44:34)
ogre Pon but then it kind of expanded (44:30 - 44:37)
with this second DLC of I want to get (44:34 - 44:38)
stronger I want the legendary Pokemon (44:37 - 44:42)
because the legendary Pokemon is the (44:38 - 44:42)
strongest (44:46 - 44:49)
yes I age I think it's interesting right (44:50 - 44:55)
because I I think well I was try I (44:53 - 44:56)
wasn't sure whether we were going down (44:55 - 44:57)
this cuz we we haven't talked about the (44:56 - 44:59)
battle with Kieran which we didn't talk (44:57 - 45:00)
about last week I don't know whether you (44:59 - 45:02)
wanted to talk about that or not yeah (45:00 - 45:03)
yeah let's do it now yeah you can go (45:02 - 45:05)
ahead Al okay my point was about the the (45:03 - 45:06)
the later (45:05 - 45:10)
story I like the one key thing that I (45:06 - 45:12)
thought about the Kieran battle was I (45:10 - 45:14)
like how he reacts to you bringing out (45:12 - 45:17)
ogre Pon and he's so viscerally angry (45:14 - 45:19)
about that like it's not just like a oh (45:17 - 45:21)
whatever no it's like he you can see in (45:19 - 45:25)
his face that he is just raging about (45:21 - 45:27)
that he is so do you remember what (45:25 - 45:30)
he cuz I didn't I didn't bring ogre Pon (45:27 - 45:33)
because I I I you made your new team I (45:30 - 45:36)
made my new team yes show (45:33 - 45:38)
off no it's not even a show off you (45:36 - 45:41)
should have brought ogre Pon but my ogre (45:38 - 45:43)
Pond was level 100 my ogre Pon knocked (45:41 - 45:46)
out his Ace Pokemon with a one hit Koo (45:43 - 45:47)
and I have never laughed harder at a (45:46 - 45:48)
video (45:47 - 45:51)
game I can't remember the exact words (45:48 - 45:52)
but it was something along the lines of (45:51 - 45:54)
you would bring an ogre here just to (45:52 - 45:56)
taunt me or something like that bring (45:54 - 45:56)
the ogre (45:56 - 46:00)
just me or something like calls it the (45:56 - 46:01)
ogre not (46:00 - 46:04)
ogre which I feel like is probably a (46:01 - 46:06)
deliberate choice right because he's (46:04 - 46:09)
he's not like respecting what we've kind (46:06 - 46:12)
of learned as her actual name sort of (46:09 - 46:14)
thing he's like I think it's probably (46:12 - 46:16)
meant to point out that he doesn't (46:14 - 46:18)
actually care about her he just like (46:16 - 46:21)
what we then see with tagos later on (46:18 - 46:24)
like that's he cares about having the (46:21 - 46:28)
Pokémon and not about knowing the (46:24 - 46:30)
Pokemon oh yeah I think like you know in (46:28 - 46:32)
like (46:30 - 46:36)
hindsight it was it was like I I it it (46:32 - 46:39)
seemed like he just liked ogre Pon (46:36 - 46:41)
because it was a a legendary (46:39 - 46:43)
Pokemon I think I think it starts out (46:41 - 46:45)
differently I think it starts out as him (46:43 - 46:48)
feeling a kinship with ogon and and (46:45 - 46:51)
being like he is not you know he's not (46:48 - 46:53)
well-liked he's not got lots of friends (46:51 - 46:56)
he's kind of the outcast oh yeah and (46:53 - 46:59)
ogron is the outcast and so that's why (46:56 - 47:02)
he starts to and then when when she like (46:59 - 47:04)
essentially turns him down right that's (47:02 - 47:07)
when I think it it kind of snaps for him (47:04 - 47:10)
and suddenly he's like oh no it's before (47:07 - 47:13)
that I promise okay no no don't go for (47:10 - 47:16)
it I'm I'm here it depends on how much (47:13 - 47:19)
speculation we want to go into there are (47:16 - 47:21)
little hints and little puzzle pieces (47:19 - 47:24)
scattered throughout these two (47:21 - 47:28)
dlc's of where exactly Kieran might be (47:24 - 47:32)
becoming more of a villain (47:28 - 47:35)
and gosh which they I thought they were (47:32 - 47:39)
going to address that in this story yes (47:35 - 47:41)
and they didn't which is why I'm (47:39 - 47:43)
grateful for the epilogue yeah which I'm (47:41 - 47:46)
hoping to be grateful for because that's (47:43 - 47:48)
that's exactly why I finished this story (47:46 - 47:50)
going wait that can't be it because (47:48 - 47:52)
there are characters throughout the (47:50 - 47:55)
Indigo disc basically saying that's not (47:52 - 47:58)
Kieran that's not the same person and I (47:55 - 48:00)
was going through that whole time saying (47:58 - 48:04)
that's not just Kieran yes I think that (48:00 - 48:06)
that is still (48:04 - 48:09)
kieran's maybe at a (48:06 - 48:13)
core goals but I also think that there (48:09 - 48:17)
is some sort of influence some sort of (48:13 - 48:22)
maximizing of say toxic (48:17 - 48:24)
behaviors that could be happening to him (48:22 - 48:28)
and I think of Us Al might have more of (48:24 - 48:29)
an idea but I haven't looked at any (48:28 - 48:31)
spoilers I don't think Steve has looked (48:29 - 48:33)
at any spoilers so we're just talking (48:31 - 48:35)
about pure speculation here I mean just (48:33 - 48:36)
for the I've not I've seen almost (48:35 - 48:38)
nothing about the epilog I've seen a (48:36 - 48:40)
couple of small things but nothing like (48:38 - 48:41)
fundamentally (48:40 - 48:44)
story-wise okay yeah and for for the (48:41 - 48:46)
record too the only thing I saw was a (48:44 - 48:49)
screenshot that said like like let's (48:46 - 48:50)
make Moshi or something that's why at (48:49 - 48:53)
the end of last week's episode I was (48:50 - 48:55)
like I thought like what happened to the (48:53 - 48:56)
Moshi (48:55 - 48:58)
mini I I don't even know if it's a mini (48:56 - 49:00)
game it looked like a mini game but oh (48:58 - 49:01)
so you didn't even know it was the (49:00 - 49:02)
epilog at that point you just thought it (49:01 - 49:03)
was somewhere in the game no I just (49:02 - 49:06)
thought it was I just saw yeah I was (49:03 - 49:07)
just going through Twitter and I just (49:06 - 49:09)
saw a screenshot of like it it said (49:07 - 49:11)
Moshi on the screen uh in kakami and I (49:09 - 49:13)
was like oh like we're going to go back (49:11 - 49:15)
to kakami at some point and like when I (49:13 - 49:17)
finished the game I was (49:15 - 49:20)
like where did I miss is this like is (49:17 - 49:21)
this like Bon and they were like oh no (49:20 - 49:23)
it's not like in the game or whatever (49:21 - 49:25)
I'm glad we Now understand why it's in (49:23 - 49:26)
the game right because like the sensible (49:25 - 49:28)
thing is to not add that into the game (49:26 - 49:29)
until you want it but because they (49:28 - 49:31)
wanted to release it on the 11th of (49:29 - 49:32)
January they had to have it in there (49:31 - 49:34)
because there's no way they were getting (49:32 - 49:36)
it out between Christmas and the 11th of (49:34 - 49:38)
January that was just not happening yeah (49:36 - 49:41)
yeah so I'm I'm assuming the epilog is (49:38 - 49:44)
going to be a mystery gift item that (49:41 - 49:47)
they just give us and then like like the (49:44 - 49:49)
dark cry thing in bdsp or like the (49:47 - 49:50)
shaman thing in (49:49 - 49:53)
bdsp you got to connect get the item and (49:50 - 49:56)
then whatever that item is triggers the (49:53 - 49:58)
the epilog and who knows how long it is (49:56 - 49:59)
who knows if it's 5 minutes or 10 (49:58 - 50:02)
minutes or an (49:59 - 50:02)
hour it's in the game so somebody knows (50:02 - 50:08)
I don't think it's humongous but I don't (50:06 - 50:10)
think it's just like uh like the kind of (50:08 - 50:12)
archus and bsp or whatever it's just (50:10 - 50:13)
like oh here it (50:12 - 50:16)
is here's your thing that's it no I (50:13 - 50:18)
think there is actually work in story to (50:16 - 50:22)
that but yeah I'm not sure the extent of (50:18 - 50:24)
that and the epilog makes kieran's story (50:22 - 50:26)
a little bit harder to talk about (50:24 - 50:29)
because we don't know for sure we we (50:26 - 50:31)
don't know for sure what's going to (50:29 - 50:33)
happen in the epilog some people it it (50:31 - 50:35)
is out there but we don't know what (50:33 - 50:36)
what's going to happen we don't know the (50:35 - 50:39)
spoilers but there were hints all (50:36 - 50:42)
throughout the teal mask about something (50:39 - 50:45)
we didn't know more about yet so there (50:42 - 50:48)
and a couple of them they zoomed in on (50:45 - 50:51)
in the epilog trailer so on the sign (50:48 - 50:55)
board the I believe the third sign board (50:51 - 50:56)
in (50:55 - 50:59)
kakami when you are traveling with (50:56 - 51:02)
Kieran taking pictures of the signboards (50:59 - 51:04)
for your school assignment on the third (51:02 - 51:07)
sign board I believe that's where it has (51:04 - 51:10)
the picture of the loyal 3 the lousy 3 (51:07 - 51:13)
and the trainer and that is one of the (51:10 - 51:15)
things that they zoomed into at the very (51:13 - 51:16)
end of the epilog (51:15 - 51:21)
trailer as well as in the shop in kitami (51:16 - 51:24)
there is that little FLH just sort of (51:21 - 51:26)
sitting in the shop (51:24 - 51:28)
they're yeah they're calling it a peach (51:26 - 51:31)
because it's related to momot the story (51:28 - 51:33)
which is what the kitakami story is (51:31 - 51:38)
based off of I believe and that is (51:33 - 51:41)
expected to be related as maybe another (51:38 - 51:44)
Force influencing or well it looks it (51:41 - 51:47)
looks like the the toxic chains that's (51:44 - 51:48)
the easiest thing to talk about there it (51:47 - 51:51)
looks like the toxic chains that are on (51:48 - 51:56)
the three lousy Trio of Pokémon it is (51:51 - 51:58)
the same color it is the same shape as (51:56 - 52:01)
the chains that have chained up those (51:58 - 52:04)
three Pokémon and so those are two hints (52:01 - 52:07)
that were in the epilog trailer that I'd (52:04 - 52:09)
been kind of pointing out in my (52:07 - 52:12)
playr that I think are related there are (52:09 - 52:16)
also oh sorry there's one more hint I (52:12 - 52:17)
don't know if you noticed Hannah but the (52:16 - 52:20)
loyal three or the lousy 3 they all have (52:17 - 52:23)
the same category of Pokemon they're (52:20 - 52:26)
known as the retainer Pokemon and so a (52:23 - 52:29)
retainer would the a retainer would mean (52:26 - 52:31)
that they are working for (52:29 - 52:34)
somebody yep yeah I mean they are all (52:31 - 52:36)
chained up they're all they're all (52:34 - 52:38)
retainers yep that makes complete sense (52:36 - 52:41)
and then the other hint towards this (52:38 - 52:43)
particular part is that when you're in (52:41 - 52:45)
kitakami at the festival and you're (52:43 - 52:48)
looking up at the lanterns in the Summer (52:45 - 52:50)
Festival that ended up not taking place (52:48 - 52:54)
in summer they have types for each of (52:50 - 52:57)
the lousy three and then they have two (52:54 - 53:00)
types outside outside of the lousy 3 or (52:57 - 53:03)
maybe one I think it's one (53:00 - 53:07)
type it's uh is it just the ghost it's (53:03 - 53:09)
just ghost that's out of place yeah (53:07 - 53:10)
there's the ghost that's out of place (53:09 - 53:12)
all of the (53:10 - 53:14)
others are the same types as the lousy 3 (53:12 - 53:16)
and then there's the ghost typing on (53:14 - 53:19)
those lanterns there but going back to (53:16 - 53:22)
Kieran and how Kieran relates to all of (53:19 - 53:26)
this the particular place where Kieran (53:22 - 53:28)
starts (53:26 - 53:31)
acting different as far as I could tell (53:28 - 53:34)
and and they've been really subtle about (53:31 - 53:37)
this this has been just little hints (53:34 - 53:39)
here and there up until the teal mask (53:37 - 53:40)
where it's (53:39 - 53:44)
still you can debate this I have debated (53:40 - 53:47)
this with friends over text for hours (53:44 - 53:48)
because plenty of people still think (53:47 - 53:51)
that this is kind of that that the teal (53:48 - 53:53)
mask and the Indigo disc are Kieran (53:51 - 53:55)
story and you know I respect that (53:53 - 53:59)
viewpoint but I disagree so there is a (53:55 - 54:01)
point at the third signboard and I know (53:59 - 54:04)
this is the third sign board where (54:01 - 54:09)
Kieran comes up and something happens on (54:04 - 54:12)
screen there's this wavy effect that (54:09 - 54:14)
happens on screen that doesn't have to (54:12 - 54:15)
do with anything else happening there's (54:14 - 54:19)
no Pokemon appearing there's no magic (54:15 - 54:21)
happening other than that that you can (54:19 - 54:23)
see but something happens on screen and (54:21 - 54:26)
from that moment onward that's when (54:23 - 54:28)
Kieran starts acting a little bit (54:26 - 54:30)
different and gets a little bit rougher (54:28 - 54:34)
on himself and those around him more and (54:30 - 54:37)
more and more until the time when you (54:34 - 54:40)
defeat him and he falls to his knees and (54:37 - 54:43)
there's another screen effect just like (54:40 - 54:46)
that but he doesn't stop there though (54:43 - 54:47)
that this is the thing his his that's (54:46 - 54:50)
when it starts to lessen though oh okay (54:47 - 54:53)
so it's that's the peak sort of thing (54:50 - 54:56)
that sounds interesting I do think I'm (54:53 - 54:58)
being a little bit cynical here but I do (54:56 - 55:01)
feel like please there is a huge history (54:58 - 55:05)
of Pokemon fans as a whole seeing things (55:01 - 55:07)
and going that's a hint about something (55:05 - 55:09)
and nothing ever happens about it again (55:07 - 55:11)
not to say it wasn't a hint and not to (55:09 - 55:12)
say there wasn't something that could (55:11 - 55:14)
have been there but I feel like then (55:12 - 55:17)
Pokemon just go eh we're done with that (55:14 - 55:19)
thank you and no I don't mean like ghost (55:17 - 55:21)
girl and ex and why right that was that (55:19 - 55:22)
was probably nothing but there's loads (55:21 - 55:25)
of them all over the place me all of a (55:22 - 55:27)
story line well yeah I mean that's yeah (55:25 - 55:29)
that's a perfect example yeah yeah (55:27 - 55:31)
absolutely like I just it just I would (55:29 - 55:33)
love for that to be the case and for us (55:31 - 55:35)
to get a proper conclusion to this (55:33 - 55:37)
because I guess that would maybe make (55:35 - 55:39)
his ending in this story feel a little (55:37 - 55:41)
bit less weird right because if he had (55:39 - 55:44)
been the implication here is possessed (55:41 - 55:47)
by something and by the end of this not (55:44 - 55:49)
necessarily there's there's a there's a (55:47 - 55:51)
distinct difference between possessed (55:49 - 55:53)
and influenced I think it's still curan (55:51 - 55:55)
at heart but I think he's been influ (55:53 - 55:59)
infuenced to be more toxic I agree with (55:55 - 56:01)
Hannah yeah it doesn't seem like he's (55:59 - 56:04)
being controlled in any way okay okay I (56:01 - 56:05)
guess that would explain a little bit (56:04 - 56:07)
because like that's my biggest (56:05 - 56:08)
frustration with this story is I really (56:07 - 56:11)
like what they're doing and and then (56:08 - 56:13)
they get to the end and you you defeat (56:11 - 56:15)
him and then you he's kind of like a (56:13 - 56:17)
little bit like frustrated we really (56:15 - 56:18)
frustrated with that blah blah blah blah (56:17 - 56:22)
blah and then you go and you go to area (56:18 - 56:25)
zero you have the whole same thing again (56:22 - 56:26)
right where he's he's like oh I'm going (56:25 - 56:29)
to catch tragos and you're like oh no (56:26 - 56:30)
here we go again cuz clearly he's not (56:29 - 56:32)
going to end up with tagos so we're (56:30 - 56:33)
going to have to deal with this again (56:32 - 56:36)
and then you have that whole bit and (56:33 - 56:38)
then right at the end he's it's it's it (56:36 - 56:41)
felt to me like a an about face like (56:38 - 56:44)
suddenly he's he's like oh can we just (56:41 - 56:46)
start again like it didn't feel like (56:44 - 56:48)
there was any progress there but maybe I (56:46 - 56:50)
don't know there was a little bit Ever (56:48 - 56:52)
After You defeated him he started kind (56:50 - 56:54)
of saying your name again and as you (56:52 - 56:58)
were going the area zero you did say (56:54 - 57:00)
wowers at least (56:58 - 57:02)
once don't I don't I never noticed him (57:00 - 57:04)
saying that at all that (57:02 - 57:09)
word you miss his signature catchphrase (57:04 - 57:09)
wowers as you're going through area zero (57:10 - 57:14)
especially right before you open the (57:13 - 57:17)
gate to the zero Lab at the as far as we (57:14 - 57:19)
knew before now the lowest part of area (57:17 - 57:22)
zero before the last part of the (57:19 - 57:24)
DLC (57:22 - 57:28)
debatably uh time machine is lower but (57:24 - 57:31)
not many people think about that um so (57:28 - 57:33)
the zero lab right as you're about to (57:31 - 57:35)
open the gate he says wowzers he says (57:33 - 57:37)
something he makes a comment and (57:35 - 57:39)
everyone looks at him and that's kind of (57:37 - 57:41)
one of the moments of him going a little (57:39 - 57:43)
bit back to normal and Carmine Smiles (57:41 - 57:45)
because that feels like her brother (57:43 - 57:48)
again and that kind of (57:45 - 57:48)
thing yeah I I I do like the word (57:48 - 57:53)
influenced it it felt like me that it (57:51 - 57:56)
felt to me like Kieran like watched one (57:53 - 57:58)
of those YouTube videos where like the (57:56 - 58:00)
guy is in the garage and he's like I've (57:58 - 58:03)
read all these books and I afforded this (58:00 - 58:06)
like huge Lambo and you can too and (58:03 - 58:07)
you're like (58:06 - 58:10)
oh the you are targeting you are (58:07 - 58:12)
influencing a very specific kind of (58:10 - 58:17)
person and they're going to fall for (58:12 - 58:20)
this uh yeah it felt very there's like (58:17 - 58:23)
hopefully like 10 people who listen this (58:20 - 58:24)
podcast that know exactly what I'm (58:23 - 58:25)
talking (58:24 - 58:27)
I would also maybe use the word (58:25 - 58:30)
corrupted and that word only comes to (58:27 - 58:33)
mind because of Porygon Z on his (58:30 - 58:36)
team I think that that (58:33 - 58:39)
choice how can we can we talk about his (58:36 - 58:41)
team because I I think I think his team (58:39 - 58:45)
is fantastic um and I'm not just because (58:41 - 58:47)
he has a cat (58:45 - 58:51)
right when he like I am not exaggerating (58:47 - 58:54)
when he brought out incinerar uh it was (58:51 - 58:57)
probably one of my favorite moments in (58:54 - 59:01)
all of Pokemon ever like his team is (58:57 - 59:07)
just so good and like as as uh like a (59:01 - 59:09)
story-wise I think it's really good but (59:07 - 59:11)
also like competitively I know it's (59:09 - 59:13)
really good and here's my nerdy voice (59:11 - 59:14)
I'm sure somebody's listening to the (59:13 - 59:17)
podcast well actually Steve I one shot (59:14 - 59:19)
all of kieran's Pokemon the first time (59:17 - 59:20)
was really easy I'm sure you did I'm (59:19 - 59:22)
sure all you're like I'm sure your level (59:20 - 59:25)
100 Kyogre and the other five leg AR (59:22 - 59:26)
Pokemon you had I'm sure you just hit (59:25 - 59:28)
water spout and you just like went on (59:26 - 59:31)
your way it's totally possible I (59:28 - 59:35)
wouldn't say like his battle was tough (59:31 - 59:36)
for me even though I was like (59:35 - 59:38)
underleveled and I built a new team and (59:36 - 59:39)
I've learned from that team that (59:38 - 59:41)
Reuniclus is just a bad Pokemon and it's (59:39 - 59:45)
not good any in any way like Reus is (59:41 - 59:47)
like dead weight but (59:45 - 59:50)
like like I I thoroughly enjoyed that (59:47 - 59:52)
battle um and I thought it was really (59:50 - 59:56)
fun I I his like (59:52 - 59:58)
they did such a good job here in Pokemon (59:56 - 60:00)
whether or not you think Pokemon games (59:58 - 60:02)
are hard or easy and I know some people (60:00 - 60:03)
struggled with certain elite four (60:02 - 60:05)
members and some people like they're (60:03 - 60:06)
just not battling people they're just (60:05 - 60:10)
not battle enjoyers anyway so they (60:06 - 60:11)
they're going to (60:10 - 60:14)
struggle I I don't think Pokemon games (60:11 - 60:15)
will ever be to the point where like (60:14 - 60:18)
they're so hard that somebody can't (60:15 - 60:20)
finish them like that's not their goal (60:18 - 60:22)
right like they want you like this isn't (60:20 - 60:23)
like Elden ring where they want you to (60:22 - 60:25)
hit your head against the wall for like (60:23 - 60:26)
five hours on a specific boss they want (60:25 - 60:27)
you to go through and especially they (60:26 - 60:29)
they want you to go through and see the (60:27 - 60:32)
rest of the story like if you cannot (60:29 - 60:33)
beat (60:32 - 60:36)
Kieran you can't see the rest of the (60:33 - 60:39)
story if you can't beat Cynthia in bdsp (60:36 - 60:40)
which a lot of people struggled with as (60:39 - 60:43)
well um you can't you literally can't (60:40 - 60:45)
even get to Shaman in bdsp if you don't (60:43 - 60:47)
beat Cynthia you have to like beat her (60:45 - 60:49)
in order for Marley to show up in the (60:47 - 60:50)
cave to like walk you through to get to (60:49 - 60:52)
Shaman (60:50 - 60:55)
like but but like the thing that I think (60:52 - 60:57)
think game freak accomplished and say (60:55 - 60:59)
what you will this is my big rant say (60:57 - 61:00)
what you will about like the frame rate (60:59 - 61:02)
of scarlet and violet or the bugs of (61:00 - 61:05)
scarlet and violet or the the how ugly (61:02 - 61:07)
Scarlet Violet is I agree with you (61:05 - 61:12)
everywhere there but I think that the (61:07 - 61:15)
balance that the competitive team or (61:12 - 61:17)
whoever designs Pokemon and moves and (61:15 - 61:19)
like puts these together I think they've (61:17 - 61:22)
done such a good job this entire series (61:19 - 61:26)
to have you know 600 Pokemon (61:22 - 61:30)
900 moves 800 abilities introdu new heal (61:26 - 61:33)
items and everything just still (61:30 - 61:36)
works like all of all of these just (61:33 - 61:39)
still work together and I think they (61:36 - 61:41)
accomplished the thing that they (61:39 - 61:43)
probably set out to do which is like (61:41 - 61:45)
we're going to show you in every battle (61:43 - 61:47)
whether that's an (61:45 - 61:49)
NPC uh whe whether that's an Elite 4 (61:47 - 61:51)
member or whether that's just some (61:49 - 61:53)
nobody standing in an open field we're (61:51 - 61:56)
going to show you a combination of how (61:53 - 61:59)
moves can work together whether that's (61:56 - 62:02)
like rabska and telepathy or uh (61:59 - 62:04)
discharge next to somebody who is ground (62:02 - 62:06)
and then earthquake next to somebody who (62:04 - 62:09)
is flying like they've done such a great (62:06 - 62:12)
job showing like here are (62:09 - 62:14)
how (62:12 - 62:17)
complex our game is and like we can like (62:14 - 62:19)
oh I didn't know I I didn't know I could (62:17 - 62:21)
do that or I didn't know that those two (62:19 - 62:23)
together for example with kieran's team (62:21 - 62:28)
of Dragonite and poly Toto of hurricane (62:23 - 62:30)
being 100% accurate in the rain thunder (62:28 - 62:34)
being 100% accurate in the rain um like (62:30 - 62:36)
the the the helping hand like I even (62:34 - 62:38)
forgot for a second like I was like oh (62:36 - 62:39)
I'm just going to Draco meteor the (62:38 - 62:41)
Dragonite and I was like a completely (62:39 - 62:43)
forgot it has multiscale so like (62:41 - 62:46)
literally if I chipped it one HP and (62:43 - 62:48)
then I Draco meteored it would have died (62:46 - 62:52)
but because of multiscale it survived it (62:48 - 62:55)
um every every po Pon has a heal item so (62:52 - 62:58)
you have expert belt on Dragonite wakon (62:55 - 63:02)
Berry on poly Toto life orb on Porygon Z (62:58 - 63:05)
and then he comes out with literally (63:02 - 63:08)
like the best Pokemon in all of (63:05 - 63:11)
competitive incore which is just (63:08 - 63:13)
absolutely fantastic with a citrus Berry (63:11 - 63:17)
which is normally what incin (63:13 - 63:17)
runs like double screens Sucker Punch (63:18 - 63:23)
Spirit Break Rim snarl that is such a (63:21 - 63:27)
common like pop popular set to run on (63:23 - 63:29)
the only thing that his like team is (63:27 - 63:31)
missing is like (63:29 - 63:34)
protects like if I look at his team his (63:31 - 63:35)
team just doesn't have protect but like (63:34 - 63:38)
assault vest hydrael like if you (63:35 - 63:40)
literally look at the competitive ladder (63:38 - 63:42)
like that's what people are running on (63:40 - 63:44)
hydrael already as a Sal Fest because it (63:42 - 63:46)
like makes the most sense like (63:44 - 63:49)
everything about his team is just so (63:46 - 63:52)
good and I'm sure people I'm sure some (63:49 - 63:53)
people struggle with them I'm sure some (63:52 - 63:55)
people (63:53 - 63:58)
thought he was very easy but like the (63:55 - 64:01)
point being is like he has like easily (63:58 - 64:04)
the coolest team in like this entire (64:01 - 64:07)
franchise and it's and and it wasn't (64:04 - 64:09)
just like random which I think goes back (64:07 - 64:12)
to the story it was like I am going to (64:09 - 64:14)
change my (64:12 - 64:18)
team to actually try to win and I think (64:14 - 64:22)
it's a little similar to hop where hop (64:18 - 64:25)
loses to beid and like beid like makes (64:22 - 64:28)
fun of him and so hop drops his Ace (64:25 - 64:31)
which is wulu and then like changes his (64:28 - 64:33)
team which is like really great and it's (64:31 - 64:34)
it was it's so frustrating that people (64:33 - 64:37)
like hated on Hop so much because like (64:34 - 64:41)
every other rival you crush they just (64:37 - 64:42)
they just come back with the same team (64:41 - 64:44)
the next time but like hop actually (64:42 - 64:46)
tries to like change his team because he (64:44 - 64:48)
keeps losing it's like the first time in (64:46 - 64:50)
Pokemon history where they're like you (64:48 - 64:52)
know what I've lost to my rival like (64:50 - 64:54)
eight times maybe I should change (64:52 - 64:56)
something and then hop does and of (64:54 - 64:58)
course like the like the he goes back to (64:56 - 65:00)
his original team because he's like I I (64:58 - 65:03)
just misusing double which is like very (65:00 - 65:05)
like yeah use your favorite Pokemon kind (65:03 - 65:08)
of thing (65:05 - 65:10)
um there is one other there is one other (65:08 - 65:11)
case of arrival doing that and that's (65:10 - 65:13)
where blue suddenly doesn't have his (65:11 - 65:15)
Raticate on the team he doesn't switch (65:13 - 65:16)
it with something else though which is (65:15 - 65:20)
the theory about it being dead but um (65:16 - 65:22)
yes I think that's an inter because we (65:20 - 65:24)
talked a little bit about this last week (65:22 - 65:25)
with the elite for members about how (65:24 - 65:27)
they clearly they've taken this DLC to (65:25 - 65:30)
to tell us about more or or to show (65:27 - 65:32)
people especially I think kind of (65:30 - 65:34)
probably people like me I'm probably the (65:32 - 65:36)
the target market for that right because (65:34 - 65:38)
I don't really care about competitive (65:36 - 65:39)
but actually when you learn about that (65:38 - 65:41)
stuff it's quite fun and I actually (65:39 - 65:42)
ended up thinking up a few of my own (65:41 - 65:45)
ones and like the one that I I realize (65:42 - 65:47)
today is when I was against it was (65:45 - 65:48)
actually kind of by accident I figured (65:47 - 65:51)
out but like when I was against the I'm (65:48 - 65:53)
rubbish with the names the steel Elite 4 (65:51 - 65:57)
member emeris yes um I was like I really (65:53 - 65:59)
need to use obviously I need to use fire (65:57 - 66:02)
blah blah blah blah blah and I had um gu (65:59 - 66:07)
is it the the Goldfish M and um that it (66:02 - 66:11)
has lava plume on it which uh hits (66:07 - 66:13)
everything around it but I realized of (66:11 - 66:17)
course I have my Dash bun which can't be (66:13 - 66:18)
hit by fire attacks and actually Buffs (66:17 - 66:20)
its defense so that was another example (66:18 - 66:22)
of like actually using what they had (66:20 - 66:24)
done and shown different things you can (66:22 - 66:26)
do going oh well I can I can take (66:24 - 66:28)
advantage of this as well and I can run (66:26 - 66:31)
this lava plume attack attack both of (66:28 - 66:34)
them and not only not hit my other (66:31 - 66:36)
Pokemon but (66:34 - 66:38)
bust increase its defense at the same (66:36 - 66:41)
time and so I that's been really nice (66:38 - 66:42)
actually being able to think I'm still (66:41 - 66:44)
never going to do competitive right I (66:42 - 66:45)
don't have the time I don't have the (66:44 - 66:48)
energy for that but it does make running (66:45 - 66:49)
Pokemon games a bit more interesting (66:48 - 66:52)
especially the second time (66:49 - 66:56)
through yeah yeah I (66:52 - 66:56)
and I think I think the cool thing about (66:56 - 67:01)
Pokemon is like at least like this DLC (66:59 - 67:05)
is like double battles lean so much (67:01 - 67:08)
into what you can do standing next to (67:05 - 67:10)
another Pokemon um which just makes it (67:08 - 67:11)
more interesting to watch and more (67:10 - 67:13)
interesting to like build around and you (67:11 - 67:16)
just have more choices um the one thing (67:13 - 67:18)
I will say before we move on from Kieran (67:16 - 67:21)
is like obviously he always had the the (67:18 - 67:22)
dipin (67:21 - 67:25)
right and I I I think for the most part (67:22 - 67:27)
like he didn't have like a these these (67:25 - 67:32)
all these other Pokemon are new but what (67:27 - 67:35)
I the thing that stood out to me is that (67:32 - 67:37)
he had a polywhirl and then he evolved (67:35 - 67:39)
it into a poly (67:37 - 67:43)
wrath and he still kept the poly line (67:39 - 67:46)
but he would have had to start (67:43 - 67:48)
over he would have had to catch another (67:46 - 67:51)
powg and then evolve it the other way (67:48 - 67:55)
and I don't like I think that's (67:51 - 67:58)
intentional mhm of like going from wrath (67:55 - 67:59)
to (67:58 - 68:01)
toad (67:59 - 68:05)
um but it kind of shows like oh I had to (68:01 - 68:08)
go like do the work again which I really (68:05 - 68:11)
liked about kieran's character of like (68:08 - 68:15)
minus the like Obsession SL whatever (68:11 - 68:17)
like it showed that like he actually (68:15 - 68:19)
wanted to get better as a trainer and (68:17 - 68:22)
like why he was undefeated because like (68:19 - 68:24)
his team is like really balanced and (68:22 - 68:26)
there's like a lot of thought into it (68:24 - 68:27)
and there's like a lot of synergy with (68:26 - 68:29)
it (68:27 - 68:32)
um and yeah and like just the little (68:29 - 68:35)
thing of like oh you had a fully evolved (68:32 - 68:37)
Poliwrath which is a pretty strong (68:35 - 68:39)
Pokemon right like every gen one fan is (68:37 - 68:41)
like I want but like you got rid of it (68:39 - 68:43)
started over with the same line and just (68:41 - 68:46)
went a different route on that (68:43 - 68:49)
line yeah y I feel like maybe there's a (68:46 - 68:52)
metaphor there about (68:49 - 68:55)
fixing your mistakes but it doesn't mean (68:52 - 68:56)
you have to go completely different (68:55 - 68:58)
direction you know just his team has (68:56 - 69:00)
been very intentional this whole time (68:58 - 69:02)
Steve you did a whole side podcast on (69:00 - 69:05)
that right yeah yeah his his his team (69:02 - 69:07)
was (69:05 - 69:10)
very thought out like he doesn't have (69:07 - 69:13)
the shiftery anymore (69:10 - 69:15)
um you could prob there's probably (69:13 - 69:16)
something with grim snarl being its own (69:15 - 69:19)
ogre because Grim snarl is an (69:16 - 69:22)
ogre um where like he couldn't get ogre (69:19 - 69:24)
Pawn so he got a different ogre just (69:22 - 69:27)
a very competitive ogre that was popular (69:24 - 69:29)
for like four plus years in the (69:27 - 69:30)
competitive (69:29 - 69:33)
scene I mean like incinerar makes sense (69:30 - 69:35)
like incinerar is a heel like he's it's (69:33 - 69:38)
known as the heel Pokemon and obviously (69:35 - 69:40)
Kieran is the heel in the situation heel (69:38 - 69:44)
being a wrestler term for bad guy um I I (69:40 - 69:46)
I don't think I think actually Hannah's (69:44 - 69:48)
100% right on the Porygon with the like (69:46 - 69:50)
the corruption stuff like I think that's (69:48 - 69:52)
why Porygon Is Here Yeah Porygon was (69:50 - 69:55)
sent out and I went oh (69:52 - 70:00)
that's that's it that makes complete (69:55 - 70:00)
sense uh but it's very it's very cool (70:00 - 70:04)
how they've been able to keep some (70:02 - 70:06)
thematic stuff going on with kieran's (70:04 - 70:08)
Team while also making it very (70:06 - 70:10)
competitive in those ways I don't (70:08 - 70:13)
remember Carmine's team very well U (70:10 - 70:15)
besides like her having some of the (70:13 - 70:16)
Pokemon she had before but she had a (70:15 - 70:18)
couple new Pokemon and when they came (70:16 - 70:22)
out I was like oh they're like these are (70:18 - 70:26)
like softer Pokémon they're not like (70:22 - 70:31)
as aggressive as her initial team (70:26 - 70:31)
was uh but I would have to relook at her (70:31 - 70:37)
team um I guess that like after (70:34 - 70:39)
defeating Kieran and and going through (70:37 - 70:43)
like Dron like being petty uh we then (70:39 - 70:45)
get called into the (70:43 - 70:49)
office to then meet GA and (70:45 - 70:51)
um oh I'm blanking on her name right now (70:49 - 70:55)
what the heck uh ra yeah yeah (70:51 - 70:58)
uh with another another dig another dig (70:55 - 70:59)
at Kon not being Champion anymore (70:58 - 71:01)
because of course the the announcer (70:59 - 71:02)
didn't know that he wasn't Champion (71:01 - 71:04)
anymore so calls him Champion Kieran oh (71:02 - 71:06)
yeah and then I think the teacher does (71:04 - 71:08)
too I think Miss Brier does too or (71:06 - 71:11)
something like that this is like the (71:08 - 71:13)
only part of the DLC where I was like (71:11 - 71:16)
none of this makes (71:13 - 71:16)
sense and I was like I hope I hope (71:16 - 71:22)
Hannah can like try to save this but (71:19 - 71:24)
like this kind of felt like this weird (71:22 - 71:27)
like okay we need to go back we need to (71:24 - 71:31)
like start the second half of the story (71:27 - 71:35)
it makes a little tiny bit of sense if (71:31 - 71:36)
you've if you've done the whole (71:35 - 71:39)
playthrough all fresh you kind of notice (71:36 - 71:41)
how when you are going down to the zero (71:39 - 71:44)
lab you let out a bunch more of the (71:41 - 71:47)
Paradox Pokemon from the lab (71:44 - 71:49)
theoretically and so those are the ones (71:47 - 71:52)
that are then starting to escape area (71:49 - 71:54)
zero and get into Pala and that's what (71:52 - 71:56)
the league is worried about there and (71:54 - 71:58)
that's why they're coming to for some (71:56 - 72:00)
reason ask a teacher who can't battle (71:58 - 72:03)
and a bunch of school children to go (72:00 - 72:06)
back down to area zero it's not just (72:03 - 72:08)
that it's also the fact that they they (72:06 - 72:10)
come in and they're like oh I wasn't (72:08 - 72:12)
expecting to see you here to you and (72:10 - 72:14)
you're like well why was I called in (72:12 - 72:15)
here then and I'm the only one that's (72:14 - 72:19)
been to area Zero from this group of (72:15 - 72:21)
people yeah there was (72:19 - 72:24)
like and and then I think says like (72:21 - 72:26)
you've been bothering about you've been (72:24 - 72:28)
bothering us about visiting AOS zero for (72:26 - 72:30)
months so like here's your like chance (72:28 - 72:33)
which is like I don't know that was a (72:30 - 72:34)
thing that was in the teal mask Miss (72:33 - 72:36)
Brier was actively trying to get into (72:34 - 72:39)
area zero and jock was going oh I don't (72:36 - 72:41)
think that's going to happen but I'll (72:39 - 72:44)
put the request through for you but it's (72:41 - 72:46)
like we have a problem now who should we (72:44 - 72:48)
rely on I don't know maybe the person (72:46 - 72:50)
that keeps annoying us about it maybe (72:48 - 72:52)
she knows something which is like ah (72:50 - 72:55)
yeah I mean it would a it a little bit (72:52 - 72:56)
more sense if they knew you were there (72:55 - 72:58)
think is my point right because they (72:56 - 73:00)
know you've been there before you're a (72:58 - 73:02)
chion Ina you're now the champion and (73:00 - 73:04)
like if they if they' done that but it's (73:02 - 73:05)
the fact that they come in and they like (73:04 - 73:07)
oh we didn't even know you were here so (73:05 - 73:09)
even that doesn't make any sense (73:07 - 73:11)
honestly they didn't even need that part (73:09 - 73:13)
of the storyline they really could have (73:11 - 73:16)
just said Miss Brier finally got access (73:13 - 73:18)
to area zero and she wants to bring some (73:16 - 73:19)
students with her to check it (73:18 - 73:22)
out I feel like what would have made (73:19 - 73:24)
more sense is like them for you cuz (73:22 - 73:27)
you've been there before and then like (73:24 - 73:29)
Miss Brier being like please take me (73:27 - 73:32)
with you yeah yep that would have that (73:29 - 73:34)
would have just like solved the (73:32 - 73:36)
everything cuz like it would be very (73:34 - 73:39)
easy for her to just be like no like I I (73:36 - 73:41)
I can help you I can be a resource to (73:39 - 73:43)
you please take me with you I like I (73:41 - 73:45)
know where to point you and be like yeah (73:43 - 73:46)
of course like I don't know what I'm (73:45 - 73:49)
really looking for she's never being led (73:46 - 73:51)
back (73:49 - 73:51)
though do you want to go through the uh (73:52 - 73:57)
Hannah do you want to go through like (73:55 - 74:00)
the the walk down to area zero the walk (73:57 - 74:03)
down to area zero that (74:00 - 74:05)
wasn't or like just like the start I (74:03 - 74:06)
guess you could walk down or you could (74:05 - 74:09)
jump down or you could teleport down but (74:06 - 74:11)
like I mean I did walk down I was kind (74:09 - 74:14)
of glad there wasn't the whole uh (74:11 - 74:16)
dialogue going so fast you can barely (74:14 - 74:20)
read it thing again but yeah you walk (74:16 - 74:23)
down there to area zero with Kieran with (74:20 - 74:25)
carine with Miss Brier Miss Brier is the (74:23 - 74:28)
descendant of Heath just as a reminder (74:25 - 74:31)
Heath is the person who was in all of (74:28 - 74:34)
the who wrote The Violet book and the (74:31 - 74:36)
Scarlet book that is who Heath was I (74:34 - 74:38)
know a lot of people had forgotten or or (74:36 - 74:41)
didn't read the book enough to know by (74:38 - 74:45)
this DLC but miss Brier is Heath's (74:41 - 74:47)
descendant and so she wants to go (74:45 - 74:50)
through and kind of prove him right and (74:47 - 74:52)
learn more about tagos theoretically as (74:50 - 74:54)
well as St (74:52 - 74:58)
the terl phenomenon outside of Pala (74:54 - 75:00)
which she kind of had but apparently is (74:58 - 75:04)
going to improve on with more untested (75:00 - 75:04)
things sorry we get to test it f yeah (75:05 - 75:11)
the entire the the entirety of blueberry (75:09 - 75:13)
Academy gets to test it for (75:11 - 75:15)
her and so you go down there with the (75:13 - 75:18)
three of them and I really thought that (75:15 - 75:20)
so there are kind of two story lines (75:18 - 75:22)
going on here there's the tpago story (75:20 - 75:24)
line and there's kieran's story line and (75:22 - 75:28)
they do overlap here in a way that that (75:24 - 75:31)
that works I suppose it's fine it's not (75:28 - 75:34)
as much as I expected it to which is why (75:31 - 75:37)
I'm glad the epilog exists but and I (75:34 - 75:40)
don't expect them to overlap any more in (75:37 - 75:44)
the epilog but uh we kind of talked (75:40 - 75:45)
about kieran's (75:44 - 75:50)
story in terms of area zero we didn't (75:45 - 75:53)
really know that there was going to be (75:50 - 75:56)
anything deeper and really were a little (75:53 - 75:57)
bit worried that it was just going to be (75:56 - 76:00)
a hallway but it was more than a hallway (75:57 - 76:01)
it was more than a (76:00 - 76:03)
hallway Pokemon out here always trying (76:01 - 76:06)
to impress more than a hallway yep (76:03 - 76:09)
multiple hallways I still don't really (76:06 - 76:12)
know what was with the indigo disc thing (76:09 - 76:15)
except just to unlock the deeper portion (76:12 - 76:17)
of the elevator but we went down the (76:15 - 76:19)
elevator we got into that deeper part of (76:17 - 76:20)
area (76:19 - 76:22)
zero yeah I was just assuming the Indigo (76:20 - 76:25)
disc was terap (76:22 - 76:25)
I thought tagos was trapped in the (76:26 - 76:30)
creepy green orb hovering above (76:28 - 76:33)
blueberry Academy I was very worried (76:30 - 76:36)
about that yeah I just remembered we did (76:33 - 76:37)
Miss just before we get too deep into (76:36 - 76:39)
that I realized we missed an important (76:37 - 76:41)
thing which is Drayton saying he wasn't (76:39 - 76:42)
going just because he can't be (76:41 - 76:45)
bothered yeah yeah know that's just I (76:42 - 76:48)
can I can relate totally totally (76:45 - 76:49)
understand and is completely within his (76:48 - 76:51)
personality but I we needed to mention (76:49 - 76:54)
that as well no they that that man is (76:51 - 76:58)
spot on that this entire DLC I feel (76:54 - 77:00)
you you know the the interesting thing (76:58 - 77:04)
that I going to the trapos fight like (77:00 - 77:06)
you get a little bit of dialogue and (77:04 - 77:08)
stuff going through that but I I did (77:06 - 77:11)
like (77:08 - 77:11)
that in in 28 years of Pokemon like they (77:11 - 77:18)
finally reused the mechanic that they've (77:16 - 77:21)
used like in two games which is you need (77:18 - 77:25)
to knock out a Pokemon to open a door (77:21 - 77:28)
and I thought that was (77:25 - 77:28)
like (77:28 - 77:33)
clever especially in area zero where it (77:30 - 77:34)
was like the first one was like very (77:33 - 77:36)
obvious oh I got to fly over there and (77:34 - 77:37)
knock out the I think it's a no burn and (77:36 - 77:39)
then then they kind of like hide the (77:37 - 77:41)
Pokemon so you get a little bit of (77:39 - 77:44)
exploration you get pick up items you do (77:41 - 77:45)
a little jumping puzzle you knock out (77:44 - 77:47)
the Pokemon the next door opens the only (77:45 - 77:50)
time I remember this is like I guess (77:47 - 77:52)
like technically (77:50 - 77:55)
Snorlax um in red and blue which is like (77:52 - 77:58)
blocking a door but that's more like you (77:55 - 78:01)
still need to get an item to do that you (77:58 - 78:03)
still need to get the Poke Flute to do (78:01 - 78:04)
that and (78:03 - 78:07)
then pseudo Widow but yeah pseudo Widow (78:04 - 78:09)
is still like you can't you need the (78:07 - 78:10)
item you you still (78:09 - 78:13)
need one of the rocket hideouts you have (78:10 - 78:17)
to take down electrode or Voltorb I (78:13 - 78:19)
can't remember to open a door there was (78:17 - 78:21)
the in heart gold soul silver or gold (78:19 - 78:22)
and silver there was like three (78:21 - 78:24)
electrodes you need knock out with L to (78:22 - 78:26)
like progress through which Al also an (78:24 - 78:28)
interesting mechanic that they don't (78:26 - 78:29)
really I feel like they don't really (78:28 - 78:32)
repeat the only the only like must knock (78:29 - 78:35)
out a Pokemon to progress and you don't (78:32 - 78:37)
need like a key item like a poke flute (78:35 - 78:40)
or the squirt bottle is in black and (78:37 - 78:42)
white you have to knock out a Crustle (78:40 - 78:44)
that is blocking a door and you can (78:42 - 78:45)
fight him at any time there's nothing (78:44 - 78:47)
you you just you have to you just have (78:45 - 78:50)
to fight the crustal to open the door (78:47 - 78:52)
spoiler for black and white there's (78:50 - 78:54)
crusts in it um (78:52 - 78:57)
but like you would just think that they (78:54 - 79:01)
would just lean on that mechanic (78:57 - 79:04)
more they don't it doesn't always make (79:01 - 79:06)
sense thematically they even went a (79:04 - 79:08)
little bit more (79:06 - 79:11)
uh in depth with it this time with it (79:08 - 79:13)
being the whole crystals thing and when (79:11 - 79:16)
you knock out the Stellar Terra Pokemon (79:13 - 79:19)
that's when the crystals disappear yeah (79:16 - 79:21)
however that makes sense but actually I (79:19 - 79:22)
will make a side note that the first (79:21 - 79:24)
Stellar ter Pokemon you have to knock (79:22 - 79:26)
out is glamora which is somewhat (79:24 - 79:29)
significant in questions we will never (79:26 - 79:31)
get never get answered probably okay I (79:29 - 79:32)
got it so glora is like the flower (79:31 - 79:35)
cannon from X and Y and then it blows (79:32 - 79:38)
the crater in and then AZ shows up and (79:35 - 79:40)
the third DLC we're going back to Callos (79:38 - 79:42)
I F I solved the whole thing Hannah (79:40 - 79:44)
gamora's materials are what you use to (79:42 - 79:46)
make Tera (79:44 - 79:48)
blast oh yeah that's (79:46 - 79:52)
too my only frustration with this bit is (79:48 - 79:54)
just let me catch the Pokemon I really (79:52 - 79:55)
wanted to catch the Pokemon cuz they're (79:54 - 79:57)
the First on you encounter with the (79:55 - 80:00)
Stellar terot type and they just don't (79:57 - 80:01)
you have to knock them out it's like (80:00 - 80:03)
they could have easily made the the the (80:01 - 80:05)
story work right because you you have to (80:03 - 80:07)
knock out the Tera part of them before (80:05 - 80:09)
you can catch them so you just say (80:07 - 80:10)
that's the thing that breaks it down (80:09 - 80:11)
they wouldn't let me it's really (80:10 - 80:13)
annoying just let me they had to wait to (80:11 - 80:15)
tell you what Stellar terot type worked (80:13 - 80:17)
until after you'd finished the tropos (80:15 - 80:21)
battle fine fine and then uh well I mean (80:17 - 80:22)
they let you catch like knock out and (80:21 - 80:24)
catch that Alpha Pokemon and legends (80:22 - 80:26)
like the three big yeah (80:24 - 80:29)
that's I know but like I'm defending you (80:26 - 80:31)
Al I'm defending you they should they (80:29 - 80:35)
should let you catch (80:31 - 80:35)
yeah I totally get why there's not like (80:35 - 80:42)
a dialogue walking sequence (80:39 - 80:46)
down because like the opening of The (80:42 - 80:48)
Doors to the tree that doesn't do (80:46 - 80:50)
anything to then getting to trapos it (80:48 - 80:54)
does take a while yeah (80:50 - 80:56)
it's an an adventure on its own and I (80:54 - 80:58)
mean this is a DLC and they're kind of (80:56 - 81:01)
trying to keep it short and there wasn't (80:58 - 81:05)
as much left in the whole talization (81:01 - 81:09)
story as I was hoping they would be just (81:05 - 81:10)
a lot of questions were never going to (81:09 - 81:12)
get answered but then also some we did (81:10 - 81:13)
get (81:12 - 81:17)
answered such as such as we're going to (81:13 - 81:19)
need another warning spoiler warning (81:17 - 81:20)
before that not actual spoilers it's in (81:19 - 81:22)
the game but a lot of people haven't (81:20 - 81:23)
found it yet (81:22 - 81:26)
oh you're talking about after tagos yeah (81:23 - 81:30)
okay before before we get there I (81:26 - 81:33)
I maybe I missed it Hannah what (81:30 - 81:37)
is so emergency in area (81:33 - 81:41)
zero you and your crew have to find it (81:37 - 81:43)
what what is the emergency about a (81:41 - 81:46)
turtle being stuck in a (81:43 - 81:49)
rock like what was the actual emergency (81:46 - 81:51)
if I'm remembering right and I think I (81:49 - 81:53)
took screenshots of it but if I'm (81:51 - 81:55)
remembering Right gaita comes to you (81:53 - 81:57)
saying the emergency is that there are (81:55 - 82:00)
too many Paradox Pokemon getting (81:57 - 82:04)
out into the rest of pdea let me double (82:00 - 82:07)
check um I think I think you're right (82:04 - 82:09)
yeah but there's there no explanation as (82:07 - 82:12)
to why in this part of the story without (82:09 - 82:13)
the other bit we're about to talk about (82:12 - 82:14)
there's no explanation in this part of (82:13 - 82:16)
the story that I remember as to why (82:14 - 82:20)
trapos has anything to do with that and (82:16 - 82:23)
why why he's stuck in the rock yeah no (82:20 - 82:26)
there's there's no explanation to tagos (82:23 - 82:28)
um I took notes on every single thing (82:26 - 82:31)
there's no explanation to tagos there (82:28 - 82:32)
may be an (82:31 - 82:36)
explanation uh in the anime but they (82:32 - 82:38)
really make it the dark they really make (82:36 - 82:40)
it The Darkest Day look look very (82:38 - 82:43)
confident as a storyline (82:40 - 82:47)
like no I (82:43 - 82:49)
[Music] (82:47 - 82:51)
mean it's really hard to talk about any (82:49 - 82:53)
of this without also talking about the (82:51 - 82:55)
the the bit at the crystal (82:53 - 82:57)
pool yeah so I mean we definitely can (82:55 - 82:59)
talk about that I think that is the (82:57 - 83:01)
reason talk about the crystal the (82:59 - 83:04)
crystal pool make it make the turtle (83:01 - 83:05)
being stuck make more sense not being (83:04 - 83:09)
stuck but about tagos in general I (83:05 - 83:13)
think a bit Yeah the crystal pool is (83:09 - 83:17)
what made this storyline satisfactory (83:13 - 83:20)
for me yeah no I I like the crystal pool (83:17 - 83:23)
which is okay we'll Circle back to tra (83:20 - 83:24)
dancing around it so (83:23 - 83:28)
much well well Circle back to trapos cuz (83:24 - 83:30)
there's some story stuff there he's (83:28 - 83:32)
stuck you pull him out you fight him (83:30 - 83:35)
obviously the Pokemon Trope then after (83:32 - 83:39)
credits roll you go to back to kakami (83:35 - 83:41)
and all you have to do is walk up to the (83:39 - 83:42)
crystal pool where you battle the (83:41 - 83:45)
myotic and if you don't know about this (83:42 - 83:47)
and if you haven't played this please go (83:45 - 83:51)
and do it yourself because it's (83:47 - 83:54)
important 3 minutes so go do that and (83:51 - 83:55)
then come back if you haven't done this (83:54 - 83:56)
you don't need to rap a ghost in your (83:55 - 83:58)
party you just literally need to have (83:56 - 84:00)
credits roll and then just go to the (83:58 - 84:03)
crystal pool in kakami and then just (84:00 - 84:04)
walk up to (84:03 - 84:06)
it (84:04 - 84:09)
um this isn't like (84:06 - 84:12)
a time travel thing it is a time travel (84:09 - 84:14)
thing thought it was like a parallel (84:12 - 84:16)
it's debatable well so I mean yeah but (84:14 - 84:18)
the whole thing is to debatable right (84:16 - 84:20)
like the Paradox Pokemon are they (84:18 - 84:21)
actually with from our timeline blah (84:20 - 84:23)
blah blah blah blah it's Etc that's all (84:21 - 84:25)
the same thing right because the (84:23 - 84:28)
question is not the I think the the key (84:25 - 84:31)
point is tagos is the source of that (84:28 - 84:34)
whatever that is trapos is the source of (84:31 - 84:36)
that whether it's time is the source of (84:34 - 84:39)
time travel or the (84:36 - 84:42)
machine right because well you arrive (84:39 - 84:44)
here and then trapos just materializes (84:42 - 84:46)
someone from either the past or a (84:44 - 84:48)
different timeline yes but we also know (84:46 - 84:50)
that the crystal pool is a place where (84:48 - 84:51)
people have said you could go and see (84:50 - 84:53)
people who have passed away (84:51 - 84:54)
that is something special about the (84:53 - 84:57)
crystal pool connecting the power of the (84:54 - 84:58)
crystals there to the power of the (84:57 - 85:01)
crystals in area zero which are R which (84:58 - 85:05)
are undoubtedly related to tagos yeah (85:01 - 85:07)
sure but seeing people is very different (85:05 - 85:09)
from Trading a book with them and (85:07 - 85:11)
actually getting a physical book out of (85:09 - 85:14)
that like they have he they were (85:11 - 85:16)
transported I keep thinking he because I (85:14 - 85:19)
was just thinking of of the one I played (85:16 - 85:20)
right but it's either of them depending (85:19 - 85:23)
on which one you play the professor the (85:20 - 85:24)
professor there we go that's a good way (85:23 - 85:27)
of doing it um you get a book the book (85:24 - 85:30)
from them right like that that it's not (85:27 - 85:32)
it's not like you just see an image of (85:30 - 85:33)
them and up till that point I was like (85:32 - 85:35)
not actually sure whether they were (85:33 - 85:36)
there or not but no they're very (85:35 - 85:38)
definitely (85:36 - 85:41)
there depending on the extent of tragos (85:38 - 85:43)
is power I mean Al you and I both watch (85:41 - 85:45)
the whole of the arrows we know how how (85:43 - 85:48)
far you can stretch the limits of (85:45 - 85:50)
imagination that's why I was like I (85:48 - 85:52)
don't know if it's time travel or (85:50 - 85:54)
different timelines cuz like apparent (85:52 - 85:56)
there's a there's a difference of that (85:54 - 85:59)
technically yes the one line where they (85:56 - 86:00)
mentioned that it's not just a time (85:59 - 86:03)
machine it is a time and space machine (86:00 - 86:07)
that solved everything enough for me (86:03 - 86:08)
that was plenty (86:07 - 86:13)
satisfa Pia I understand I'm not I mean (86:08 - 86:15)
I feel like no explanation to that would (86:13 - 86:17)
be satisfactory right because then you (86:15 - 86:19)
then you end up in the the debates of (86:17 - 86:21)
time travel paradoxes I I think they're (86:19 - 86:23)
just leaning into that the debates of (86:21 - 86:25)
time travel paradoxes but my my point is (86:23 - 86:26)
I think they're just leaning into it and (86:25 - 86:28)
they're going it doesn't matter it (86:26 - 86:30)
doesn't matter whether it's one timeline (86:28 - 86:32)
or multiple timelines it's happening (86:30 - 86:34)
deal with it right that's that's what (86:32 - 86:36)
they're saying and I'm okay with that (86:34 - 86:37)
yep I mean if we're talking about (86:36 - 86:40)
mythical Pokemon celibe is not allowed (86:37 - 86:43)
in the game therefore it cannot be time (86:40 - 86:45)
travel think about that they no I will (86:43 - 86:48)
not think about (86:45 - 86:48)
that no I I like that part I think it (86:48 - 86:53)
was cool that like oh you're you're (86:51 - 86:55)
still alive oh you don't care about your (86:53 - 86:57)
son that's weird uh oh like that's not (86:55 - 87:00)
what they (86:57 - 87:03)
said no I I think my point is like I (87:00 - 87:07)
think that explains the emergency and (87:03 - 87:08)
it's weird that this wasn't part of the (87:07 - 87:11)
story because I think that you did (87:08 - 87:14)
something that then got trapos stuck and (87:11 - 87:17)
now trapos is just going crazy and doing (87:14 - 87:18)
more of what the machine does or (87:17 - 87:20)
powering up the machine or blah whatever (87:18 - 87:21)
is the machine still around at this (87:20 - 87:23)
point I forget what the deal is with (87:21 - 87:25)
that you can go into the machine room (87:23 - 87:27)
still uh before you unlock the deeper (87:25 - 87:29)
part of area zero you can go into that (87:27 - 87:32)
room still so tagos has a is is is (87:29 - 87:35)
either the source of it or is being you (87:32 - 87:37)
know harnessed by it or something and (87:35 - 87:39)
the emergency is because trapos (87:37 - 87:41)
something happened with tagos and now (87:39 - 87:44)
because of that more Paradox Pokemon are (87:41 - 87:46)
coming from the timelines or the past or (87:44 - 87:49)
the future doesn't matter that's the (87:46 - 87:51)
issue I'm not sure any of that was said (87:49 - 87:53)
but I could imagine it wasn't it wasn't (87:51 - 87:55)
said I'm not saying it was said I'm (87:53 - 87:57)
saying it was implied and you don't get (87:55 - 87:58)
that implication until you go to the (87:57 - 88:00)
crystal pool if you don't go to the (87:58 - 88:02)
crystal pool you have no idea that (88:00 - 88:05)
trapos has could possibly have any (88:02 - 88:06)
indication to do with that you do have (88:05 - 88:08)
an idea because there are the journal (88:06 - 88:11)
entries they they're all the book pages (88:08 - 88:14)
with read I didn't read a (88:11 - 88:16)
book I'm not read you don't get to argue (88:14 - 88:18)
that you're right about the story not no (88:16 - 88:20)
no no that's no no because that whether (88:18 - 88:23)
whether the book or not right that isn't (88:20 - 88:25)
something you have to go through through (88:23 - 88:27)
the story right so whether the book (88:25 - 88:29)
tells you or whether the the thing at (88:27 - 88:31)
the Crystal Pool tells you if you don't (88:29 - 88:33)
do either of those things which are not (88:31 - 88:35)
required for the main story Miss Brier (88:33 - 88:36)
directly shows you the page of the book (88:35 - 88:38)
that's not blacked out or censored in (88:36 - 88:40)
anyway you have the book there as part (88:38 - 88:43)
of the story that is unskippable no I (88:40 - 88:46)
think I think what Al's (88:43 - 88:46)
saying is like in the book before trapos (88:46 - 88:52)
that you find in the desk that's that's (88:51 - 88:55)
randomly down there (88:52 - 88:57)
it's it's it says that you're going to (88:55 - 89:00)
do the thing you do at the Crystal (88:57 - 89:03)
Pool it like predicts it for you there (89:00 - 89:06)
is that moment it it says like that is (89:03 - 89:08)
the one and only hint that people have (89:06 - 89:11)
to go to the crystal pool right right so (89:08 - 89:14)
I think what Al is saying is that at (89:11 - 89:16)
some point all of this is happening (89:14 - 89:18)
because trapos is (89:16 - 89:21)
stuck yes and we don't know why he's (89:18 - 89:23)
stuck but it doesn't matter because the (89:21 - 89:25)
time not the time whatever you want to (89:23 - 89:26)
call it the timeline the parallel (89:25 - 89:28)
universes they're messed (89:26 - 89:32)
up yes and they don't explain why he's (89:28 - 89:34)
stuck but because he is stuck that's the (89:32 - 89:36)
problem that's that yeah and I'm not (89:34 - 89:39)
saying it says that it doesn't say that (89:36 - 89:42)
but I think it it hints at that possibly (89:39 - 89:45)
being the reason I think after we sto (89:42 - 89:47)
they seem to think the problem is over (89:45 - 89:50)
yeah yeah yes because like it still (89:47 - 89:53)
doesn't make sense why he is stuck and (89:50 - 89:55)
why we go down there to pull him out (89:53 - 89:57)
unless the reason he is stuck is because (89:55 - 89:59)
things are (89:57 - 89:59)
broken or like out of place either way I (90:00 - 90:05)
think we probably put more thought into (90:03 - 90:07)
it now than they did writing it but I'm (90:05 - 90:09)
not sure about that part I think that (90:07 - 90:11)
part is really just they needed a way (90:09 - 90:12)
get they hav stuck then he could have (90:11 - 90:13)
just been there he could have just been (90:12 - 90:17)
hanging out why is there a (90:13 - 90:21)
tree the tree is there because tragus (90:17 - 90:23)
was stuck (90:21 - 90:26)
oh I see I see gr come up with all these (90:23 - 90:28)
weird ideas for every one minute he was (90:26 - 90:30)
stuck the tree grows 5 years I found (90:28 - 90:32)
really funny is like the tree was like (90:30 - 90:35)
so visible in the trailer and like until (90:32 - 90:38)
you mentioned the tree again today I (90:35 - 90:40)
forgot about the tree like I don't even (90:38 - 90:42)
remember who didn't even notice it was (90:40 - 90:44)
there no exactly did we actually see it (90:42 - 90:46)
it was there was it was it On Top of the (90:44 - 90:48)
Rock the trapos was stuck in in Scarlet (90:46 - 90:49)
there was a gargle so it was going to be (90:48 - 90:52)
a different Pokemon in Violet but it was (90:49 - 90:54)
on the same island as one of the Pokemon (90:52 - 90:55)
you had to knock out to get past the (90:54 - 90:59)
crystal barriers yeah oh you just had to (90:55 - 91:02)
look looked up yeah I didn't look up how (90:59 - 91:03)
do you not look up you have to go down (91:02 - 91:05)
like a water canal to get to it and then (91:03 - 91:06)
the whole thing it's surrounded by this (91:05 - 91:08)
beautiful deep pool I wish we could (91:06 - 91:10)
still dive so that you could actually (91:08 - 91:12)
explore that place more I was just (91:10 - 91:14)
finding the Pokemon to then go back I (91:12 - 91:17)
wasn't exploring at this point I I was (91:14 - 91:18)
exploring cuz I there was items on the (91:17 - 91:19)
ground I thought I was going to miss (91:18 - 91:20)
something so I (91:19 - 91:23)
was okay we talk about the second cool (91:20 - 91:25)
this so the first coolest part of this (91:23 - 91:29)
entire DLC is Kieran has incar no debate (91:25 - 91:31)
there right like coolest part of the (91:29 - 91:33)
entire DLC is Kieran using yeah we're (91:31 - 91:35)
all in agreement glad glad we got there (91:33 - 91:37)
the second coolest part is when he (91:35 - 91:42)
throws a master ball at trapos it was so (91:37 - 91:45)
cool it was like one of the top five (91:42 - 91:48)
moments in all of Pokemon where like (91:45 - 91:51)
like it's it it's like anytime you watch (91:48 - 91:53)
a movie and the bad guy is like like (91:51 - 91:55)
here's here here's how I'm going to end (91:53 - 91:56)
your life you're going to slowly be (91:55 - 91:58)
dropped in this pool of lava and it's (91:56 - 91:59)
just like just drop them it doesn't need (91:58 - 92:03)
to be like a 10 like he wasted no time (91:59 - 92:06)
that the the tragos popped out and he (92:03 - 92:08)
threw his master ball in it was so cool (92:06 - 92:11)
it I it something about (92:08 - 92:15)
like a a a non-player character throwing (92:11 - 92:17)
a master ball and it just doing that (92:15 - 92:19)
like I'm going to say and it succeed of (92:17 - 92:20)
course it would succeed it's a master (92:19 - 92:22)
well see you say you say that but I was (92:20 - 92:23)
the is actually the teest chance that (92:22 - 92:25)
master ball can fail and I was like oh (92:23 - 92:27)
is that what they're going to do here is (92:25 - 92:30)
that the plan that actually it will fail (92:27 - 92:31)
because there's that absolutely tiny (92:30 - 92:33)
chance and they're going to go into the (92:31 - 92:35)
whole Pokemon do actually choose that (92:33 - 92:37)
would make so many people angry though (92:35 - 92:39)
oh yeah oh I'm sure it would have (92:37 - 92:40)
absolutely because I don't think many (92:39 - 92:42)
people actually realize that there is (92:40 - 92:45)
actually a chance that M bro can fail um (92:42 - 92:47)
no that would make so many people angry (92:45 - 92:49)
and there is actually there is actually (92:47 - 92:51)
a moment it's not just tagos pops out (92:49 - 92:52)
and Kieran throws them master ball at it (92:51 - 92:55)
it's tragos pops out and the first (92:52 - 92:57)
person it sees is the player character (92:55 - 93:00)
and it starts innocently and very cutely (92:57 - 93:01)
walking towards the player character and (93:00 - 93:05)
Kieran goes not again yeah yeah yeah and (93:01 - 93:08)
I think this kind of (93:05 - 93:08)
like it it kind of points to kieran's (93:08 - 93:15)
motives of like I just want a strong (93:12 - 93:18)
Pokemon and this is a legendary and I (93:15 - 93:20)
have a master ball like I'm not going to (93:18 - 93:22)
let this get away like no one like I'm (93:20 - 93:24)
not gonna think about it I'm not gonna (93:22 - 93:25)
debate with anyone I'm just gonna throw (93:24 - 93:28)
it it's mine I'm sure if he had a master (93:25 - 93:31)
ball when you approached ogre Pon well I (93:28 - 93:32)
don't think I don't actually think that (93:31 - 93:35)
I don't think he was in that (93:32 - 93:38)
mindset to be like not quite yeah I (93:35 - 93:39)
don't think he would have I don't think (93:38 - 93:41)
he would have thrown the master ball (93:39 - 93:43)
there versus throwing the master ball (93:41 - 93:45)
now and I think that's like yeah cool (93:43 - 93:48)
story development of like I lost but I'm (93:45 - 93:51)
still not giving up I'm going to C (93:48 - 93:54)
moment of desper ation I think when you (93:51 - 93:56)
when you were at ogre Pon I don't think (93:54 - 93:59)
he even thought through I don't even (93:56 - 94:00)
thought it was a possibility that ogon (93:59 - 94:01)
wouldn't go with (94:00 - 94:07)
him and and then through that (94:01 - 94:10)
rejection he then realizes it right I it (94:07 - 94:11)
needs to be I need I need to not give (94:10 - 94:14)
them a CH a choice next time so I need (94:11 - 94:16)
to to work to get that master ball to (94:14 - 94:18)
then make sure that I don't fail well he (94:16 - 94:21)
didn't try to give ogrean a choice but (94:18 - 94:23)
it's along those lines sure but didn't (94:21 - 94:26)
try but ogon still had the choice right (94:23 - 94:27)
that's the point with whereas with the (94:26 - 94:29)
master ball if we ignore the tiny chance (94:27 - 94:31)
of the master has you basically it had (94:29 - 94:33)
had no choice at that (94:31 - 94:36)
point I always I I did like the battle (94:33 - 94:38)
with (94:36 - 94:40)
trapos um I always think personally this (94:38 - 94:42)
is just a personal preference I (94:40 - 94:45)
think battles with Pokemon you've never (94:42 - 94:47)
fought before are more fun when you (94:45 - 94:50)
don't know their (94:47 - 94:52)
typing um again this is just (94:50 - 94:55)
like people will debate of whether like (94:52 - 94:57)
looking at a guide book is like takes (94:55 - 94:59)
the fun out of it like as a as like a (94:57 - 95:01)
10-year-old I played through all of (94:59 - 95:02)
Ocarina of Time with a guide book in my (95:01 - 95:05)
lap and I had the world's best time in (95:02 - 95:06)
the entire world right like and then I (95:05 - 95:07)
when I played through Elden ring I was (95:06 - 95:08)
like I don't want to look at anything (95:07 - 95:10)
and I had the best time in the world for (95:08 - 95:14)
me with Pokemon it was like I I did not (95:10 - 95:18)
know um Ultra necrosmos typing and that (95:14 - 95:20)
was like a couple turns of like trying (95:18 - 95:22)
to figure out which move is super (95:20 - 95:24)
effective and like like losing that (95:22 - 95:26)
first battle cuz I was like I I don't (95:24 - 95:28)
know what type he is and then with (95:26 - 95:30)
trapos I had no clue he was normal type (95:28 - 95:33)
I'm water moves fire moves electric like (95:30 - 95:36)
I'm what like and then I like I'm like (95:33 - 95:38)
second guessing myself because I'm like (95:36 - 95:40)
I don't know what Stellar does either so (95:38 - 95:43)
like I I was like if he's doing this (95:40 - 95:46)
move is his type (95:43 - 95:49)
changing I knew I knew he was normal (95:46 - 95:52)
type but I didn't know about the the (95:49 - 95:55)
type Effectiveness inversion so as soon (95:52 - 95:56)
as I saw that little bit where it was (95:55 - 95:59)
like oh the it's messing with the type (95:56 - 96:02)
Effectiveness I was like oh no what do I (95:59 - 96:03)
do now I was all ready just to throw a (96:02 - 96:05)
fighting move at it and now I need to (96:03 - 96:08)
think about it it does I I agree with (96:05 - 96:09)
you it does make it a little bit more (96:08 - 96:10)
fun there's only so much that I can (96:09 - 96:12)
ignore beforehand right so like you find (96:10 - 96:14)
these things out but apparently I didn't (96:12 - 96:16)
know that bit beforehand which that make (96:14 - 96:20)
it a bit more fun and I I did like (96:16 - 96:23)
the I I I was so like I think at one (96:20 - 96:24)
point Miss Brier was like you need to (96:23 - 96:26)
tralize in order to like do damage to (96:24 - 96:28)
over and over and over again and I was (96:26 - 96:30)
like I know but I have to attack it (96:28 - 96:31)
three times and then my twitch chat was (96:30 - 96:33)
like you no you can tralize right now (96:31 - 96:35)
and I was like oh I'm so used to raid (96:33 - 96:37)
battles I'm like no I think you did have (96:35 - 96:41)
to you have you have to do it twice not (96:37 - 96:42)
three times okay (96:41 - 96:46)
okay so like I'm I'm I'm I'm like trying (96:42 - 96:47)
to like count Moves In My Head instead (96:46 - 96:48)
of just like looking at the button (96:47 - 96:50)
that's lit up because I'm like so used (96:48 - 96:53)
to like raid battles slightly different (96:50 - 96:55)
mechanics um yeah I did have a similar (96:53 - 96:56)
sort of thing to you where I was like oh (96:55 - 96:59)
no it's stolen my my Tera oh no what am (96:56 - 97:00)
I going to do for the rest of the battle (96:59 - 97:02)
I didn't realize you got it again until (97:00 - 97:04)
it came up with it and I was like oh (97:02 - 97:08)
it's still there yeah yeah and then um (97:04 - 97:11)
what I think Carmine helps you with one (97:08 - 97:13)
Pokemon because she's like I only have (97:11 - 97:14)
sinistra or (97:13 - 97:17)
whatever and then eventually Kieran (97:14 - 97:20)
joins you which like that end part where (97:17 - 97:23)
like you fight Kieran Kieran loses to (97:20 - 97:25)
you he like doesn't understand what he (97:23 - 97:27)
does wrong like the love of Pokemon like (97:25 - 97:29)
that nothing there was like kind of new (97:27 - 97:32)
in the sense of like Pokemon games and (97:29 - 97:35)
then trapos breaks out dig evolves into (97:32 - 97:38)
the bigger one and then you fight (97:35 - 97:41)
alongside Carmine and then alongside (97:38 - 97:43)
Kieran and that was like very standard (97:41 - 97:45)
like okay this is what like brings our (97:43 - 97:46)
friendship back together as us fighting (97:45 - 97:49)
this very powerful Pokemon together like (97:46 - 97:52)
it was I don't know how else you do that (97:49 - 97:53)
like it was just like a very standard (97:52 - 97:57)
Pokemon thing to do to like wrap that up (97:53 - 97:58)
I I thought it was fine though like I (97:57 - 98:00)
enjoyed that battle I thought it was fun (97:58 - 98:02)
like it was predictable in the sense of (98:00 - 98:03)
like of course Carmine's going to run (98:02 - 98:05)
out and then kieran's going to step in (98:03 - 98:08)
for her um I liked it I I but I don't (98:05 - 98:10)
think it was like that part was super (98:08 - 98:14)
unique but I don't think it was bad I (98:10 - 98:17)
liked his like reticence to do it (98:14 - 98:20)
initially like oh I have failed twice (98:17 - 98:23)
now I lost two you Al and then I and (98:20 - 98:27)
then I lost to you again right uh I'm (98:23 - 98:29)
clearly useless now I can't do anything (98:27 - 98:31)
right his confidence is completely gone (98:29 - 98:34)
no confidence I liked that and then how (98:31 - 98:36)
he's finally like okay fine fine I'll (98:34 - 98:39)
help and then and helps I just felt like (98:36 - 98:43)
the like oh because we defeated tragus (98:39 - 98:45)
together that means I now forgive you (98:43 - 98:48)
for lying to me and going behind my back (98:45 - 98:49)
and all of that and we're not even going (98:48 - 98:52)
to mention that again that the Wikipedia (98:49 - 98:54)
bullet point yeah that just that just (98:52 - 98:56)
feels like they just completely just (98:54 - 98:58)
were like well we want to get from A to (98:56 - 99:00)
B so we've gone gone from A to B but (98:58 - 99:02)
there's no real reasoning as to why (99:00 - 99:03)
they've gone from and it didn't even I (99:02 - 99:05)
don't even think it needed to be huge (99:03 - 99:07)
even just the fact of like if he had (99:05 - 99:09)
gone something like I don't think I'm (99:07 - 99:12)
quite there yet we'll need some time but (99:09 - 99:13)
I'm sure I'll get there something like (99:12 - 99:15)
that or like he didn't even need to be (99:13 - 99:17)
immediately like oh especially as we now (99:15 - 99:19)
know we've got the epilog right they (99:17 - 99:20)
could have done a little bit more there (99:19 - 99:22)
but no they had they wanted to be here (99:20 - 99:23)
they wanted him to be friends with you (99:22 - 99:26)
again now it need the sunrise happy (99:23 - 99:29)
ending moment they they needed the (99:26 - 99:31)
before and after pictures in the credits (99:29 - 99:34)
yeah yes I do feel like there were (99:31 - 99:37)
moments as you know I feel like the (99:34 - 99:40)
moment when Kieran starts going back to (99:37 - 99:42)
normal is when you defeat him and just (99:40 - 99:44)
sort of starts getting more and more (99:42 - 99:48)
back to who he is actually debatably (99:44 - 99:52)
very much so but (99:48 - 99:55)
I mean yeah if you don't if you don't (99:52 - 99:57)
pick up those little Clues it's very (99:55 - 99:59)
what they've done with kieran's story is (99:57 - 100:04)
not only subtle and so far because of (99:59 - 100:07)
the the epilogue is debatable on what's (100:04 - 100:08)
actually going to happen and what (100:07 - 100:11)
actually is happening but it's not it's (100:08 - 100:14)
also not great morally like this is not (100:11 - 100:17)
how I would have written this story it's (100:14 - 100:19)
super interesting to me because of the (100:17 - 100:21)
way they're doing it there are things (100:19 - 100:23)
that it's been super fun to find clues (100:21 - 100:27)
for but this is not all lining up quite (100:23 - 100:30)
right in all the (100:27 - 100:30)
ways yeah it felt like um they had so (100:30 - 100:36)
much to answer and so much to talk (100:33 - 100:39)
about and they they I guess they did but (100:36 - 100:41)
not in any of the ways I (100:39 - 100:44)
expected yeah (100:41 - 100:46)
like I think I think the Kieran stuff (100:44 - 100:48)
does like make sense him being really (100:46 - 100:50)
strong him losing to you him like trying (100:48 - 100:51)
to catch another another legendary (100:50 - 100:54)
Pokemon to defeat you losing then like (100:51 - 100:56)
you needing help and him joining and (100:54 - 100:57)
then (100:56 - 100:59)
like that was not surprising and that it (100:57 - 101:02)
was fine again not bad I enjoyed it but (100:59 - 101:04)
I was like a little predictable I think (101:02 - 101:06)
that the what was like surprising is (101:04 - 101:10)
like how useless Brier (101:06 - 101:13)
was like that was actually surprising (101:10 - 101:15)
when she calls you into the office she's (101:13 - 101:17)
like I finally get to go to area zero (101:15 - 101:18)
and then she like gives you some (101:17 - 101:20)
dialogue down there and then even during (101:18 - 101:24)
the battle she's like hey teriz and (101:20 - 101:27)
you're like duh and then it was like I (101:24 - 101:28)
don't I don't even remember her saying (101:27 - 101:30)
anything after the fight is over I I (101:28 - 101:31)
know she does this is and this is this (101:30 - 101:33)
is my big bug beard about this right (101:31 - 101:36)
what we've just witnessed right is we've (101:33 - 101:38)
caught this Pokemon right kieran's (101:36 - 101:40)
caught this Pokemon and then he's used (101:38 - 101:42)
it to battle and then it has expanded (101:40 - 101:44)
out of he's broken out of the Pokeball (101:42 - 101:46)
so destroyed the Pokeball is then gotten (101:44 - 101:49)
into this battle that is going to bring (101:46 - 101:50)
the cave down on on top of us they're (101:49 - 101:52)
legit imately worried that we're all (101:50 - 101:55)
about to die here so we need to step in (101:52 - 101:58)
and save us all from dying like it's (101:55 - 102:00)
very clear they're worried about that (101:58 - 102:02)
and then you catch trapos again and (102:00 - 102:05)
they're like okay I'm glad you've got (102:02 - 102:07)
trapos now and you're like how is this (102:05 - 102:09)
any different we we know that this (102:07 - 102:12)
Pokemon can break out of pokeballs and (102:09 - 102:15)
kill people why are we now okay with me (102:12 - 102:18)
a different child having this Pokemon (102:15 - 102:20)
it's like it's not even like with with (102:18 - 102:22)
so many of the legend AR Pokemon it's (102:20 - 102:23)
just you on your own going to find out (102:22 - 102:25)
or you with like the the bad guys and (102:23 - 102:27)
you're the one that takes it down or (102:25 - 102:28)
whatever you don't have a teacher there (102:27 - 102:31)
with you who sees it nearly killing you (102:28 - 102:32)
and then is totally fine with you taking (102:31 - 102:35)
it just seems so bizarre that she's just (102:32 - 102:37)
like great that's it that's all she said (102:35 - 102:41)
she's like great let's (102:37 - 102:44)
go her her motive is to go to area zero (102:41 - 102:48)
to like because of Heath and stuff but (102:44 - 102:51)
like we walk out of that cave with like (102:48 - 102:53)
me and Kieran are best friends now and I (102:51 - 102:56)
have a tragos what is like bri walking (102:53 - 102:57)
out of that cave doing she writes a book (102:56 - 103:01)
she publishes a book she's good yeah I (102:57 - 103:03)
think no I think I think she she found (103:01 - 103:04)
the place that no one else knew about (103:03 - 103:06)
that's the key Point that's all she (103:04 - 103:09)
wanted was that's yeah of course of (103:06 - 103:10)
course I think and and I think we see (103:09 - 103:12)
that as Hannah says when she writes the (103:10 - 103:14)
book that that's what she she's she's (103:12 - 103:17)
using it for fame yeah I had such high (103:14 - 103:19)
hopes for her because her character was (103:17 - 103:22)
super interesting her char design has (103:19 - 103:25)
all of the lore hints in it her theme (103:22 - 103:26)
when you talk to her for the first time (103:25 - 103:29)
before the teal mask if you're listening (103:26 - 103:31)
to it it goes back and forth between (103:29 - 103:33)
setting out on a new adventure kind of (103:31 - 103:36)
uphe hearted up light-hearted theme (103:33 - 103:39)
music and very much evil character music (103:36 - 103:40)
it just goes back and forth between (103:39 - 103:42)
those in her one theme I was really (103:40 - 103:45)
expecting her to to turn around and be a (103:42 - 103:48)
character you battled but she can't (103:45 - 103:53)
battle Yeah I I'm like like most stories (103:48 - 103:56)
or especially most game development (103:53 - 103:59)
which this is not like exclusive to (103:56 - 104:01)
Pokemon but you if if you like look at (103:59 - 104:03)
other developers whether that's like (104:01 - 104:09)
Bungie or 343 or respawn or whatever um (104:03 - 104:10)
they always talk about like how (104:09 - 104:11)
sometimes like the story is written (104:10 - 104:12)
first and then they try to fit gameplay (104:11 - 104:14)
around it or sometimes the gameplay is (104:12 - 104:16)
like just there and then they have to (104:14 - 104:19)
wrap story around it um like I'm sure (104:16 - 104:21)
that's very complicated I'm I'm trying (104:19 - 104:23)
to line everything up of like how are we (104:21 - 104:25)
going to tell the story in this game is (104:23 - 104:27)
is hard and at least it's not like an X (104:25 - 104:29)
and Y situation where like things (104:27 - 104:32)
legitimately don't make sense at all (104:29 - 104:35)
like in this story even though like I (104:32 - 104:37)
have a couple complaints about like (104:35 - 104:40)
Brier was useless or whatever like (104:37 - 104:43)
everything mostly made sense uh and the (104:40 - 104:44)
things that didn't make sense you can (104:43 - 104:48)
just chalk up to like ah time travel (104:44 - 104:51)
yeah time and space travel and the (104:48 - 104:52)
player character got to be a part of it (104:51 - 104:54)
which was my main qualm in sword and (104:52 - 104:59)
shield so I'm happy like I I do think (104:54 - 105:01)
storywise in all Pokemon games like I've (104:59 - 105:03)
said this before in the show like I (105:01 - 105:06)
don't think I think there are people (105:03 - 105:09)
that come to Pokemon for like a (105:06 - 105:13)
story I I don't think Pokemon tells a (105:09 - 105:15)
relatively good story at all I think (105:13 - 105:18)
it's very like start to finish tongue (105:15 - 105:21)
and cheek predictable like I think (105:18 - 105:23)
probably my favorite video game (105:21 - 105:26)
story like top three video game stories (105:23 - 105:30)
I think I have are like Night in the (105:26 - 105:31)
Woods (105:30 - 105:33)
which it's I mean it's a game but it's (105:31 - 105:36)
more of a game than going home I (105:33 - 105:38)
guess but like Night in the Woods The (105:36 - 105:41)
Last of Us and probably like Uncharted 4 (105:38 - 105:42)
are probably like my three favorite (105:41 - 105:44)
video game stories and I think the the (105:42 - 105:46)
thing that all those stories have in (105:44 - 105:49)
common is somebody can be sitting on a (105:46 - 105:51)
couch next to you and not not even play (105:49 - 105:54)
the game but like enjoy it like I (105:51 - 105:55)
remember playing The Last of Us and I (105:54 - 105:57)
was like I was like specifically told (105:55 - 105:59)
like you cannot play anymore until I get (105:57 - 106:01)
home from work because I like I need to (105:59 - 106:02)
I need to know what's going to happen (106:01 - 106:04)
next like it's like I want to finish (106:02 - 106:05)
this game I gota wait till you get home (106:04 - 106:08)
from work like okay like but that's that (106:05 - 106:09)
never that's not happening in Pokemon no (106:08 - 106:12)
one's being like babe uh like we can't (106:09 - 106:14)
see what Brier's going to do next like (106:12 - 106:17)
yeah got like I literally replayed the (106:14 - 106:20)
entire thing for this second DLC I was (106:17 - 106:22)
that excited about this story I don't (106:20 - 106:24)
necessarily think we I mean we didn't (106:22 - 106:26)
get all the answers not everything made (106:24 - 106:29)
sense but it was really interesting l (106:26 - 106:33)
and a cool time so plus with how (106:29 - 106:35)
debatable kieran's story is I think that (106:33 - 106:37)
I think that this is a more interesting (106:35 - 106:40)
story than they've done before both both (106:37 - 106:43)
stories that they have in this game also (106:40 - 106:45)
predictable stories don't can be fun (106:43 - 106:47)
right like I've I've just spent I've (106:45 - 106:49)
just spent three weeks running up to (106:47 - 106:51)
Christmas watching Christmas films and (106:49 - 106:53)
they all have the same story but that (106:51 - 106:55)
doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching (106:53 - 107:00)
them no I I enjoyed the Elite 4 I (106:55 - 107:03)
enjoyed going down to area zero I just I (107:00 - 107:04)
just think there were like little holes (107:03 - 107:06)
that were like no you you could have (107:04 - 107:07)
done that better and they probably know (107:06 - 107:09)
that they probably were like yeah you (107:07 - 107:10)
know we messed this up like literally (107:09 - 107:12)
there's an interview of massuda being (107:10 - 107:14)
like we don't I I don't know what they (107:12 - 107:16)
were going to do with a like there's (107:14 - 107:17)
actually an interview of him being like (107:16 - 107:19)
ah a I don't know (107:17 - 107:21)
like uh (107:19 - 107:23)
I that's what we have fanfiction for (107:21 - 107:24)
right (107:23 - 107:26)
[Laughter] (107:24 - 107:29)
like and and and they they have said (107:26 - 107:31)
plenty of times they as like game freak (107:29 - 107:33)
has said plenty of times that they like (107:31 - 107:36)
to leave things open (107:33 - 107:42)
for us to speculate or talk about and I (107:36 - 107:44)
think that's fine I mean like that is (107:42 - 107:45)
that is the series as a whole is like (107:44 - 107:48)
these pokeddex entries that are obscure (107:45 - 107:50)
enough and these plot holes that are (107:48 - 107:53)
obscure enough and whatever weird (107:50 - 107:55)
timeline megas are now in Ruby and (107:53 - 107:59)
Sapphire separation thing that broke (107:55 - 108:02)
everything like I've accepted that I I (107:59 - 108:04)
think there is part of me that like (108:02 - 108:07)
sometimes I like a concrete (108:04 - 108:09)
story where whereas like I know there (108:07 - 108:10)
are people that like love Inception (108:09 - 108:13)
because like Inception is so like open (108:10 - 108:15)
to interpretation at the end and it's (108:13 - 108:17)
like I would rather have like the (108:15 - 108:19)
concrete stuff but once they got to like (108:17 - 108:20)
the crystal pool with the time travel I (108:19 - 108:21)
was like this was never going to be (108:20 - 108:24)
concrete like you've already you you've (108:21 - 108:26)
solidified that you've you're not going (108:24 - 108:28)
to give us a (108:26 - 108:31)
clear and that's fine so here's (108:28 - 108:33)
something I've been thinking like could (108:31 - 108:35)
they do this more in Pokemon games pre (108:33 - 108:38)
DLC could they do this sort of thing (108:35 - 108:42)
where they release a game slowly right (108:38 - 108:45)
where you have parts of story given to (108:42 - 108:48)
us over the course of a year and because (108:45 - 108:49)
because that's essentially what we've (108:48 - 108:52)
done here right we've got the the the (108:49 - 108:54)
main story (108:52 - 108:57)
which may or may not L technically (108:54 - 108:59)
that's what they sold yeah that's that's (108:57 - 109:01)
true that's true according to the (108:59 - 109:03)
trailer for The epilog it does seem like (109:01 - 109:05)
it's going to link it to it it it does (109:03 - 109:08)
yes yeah um and then there's the The (109:05 - 109:10)
teil Mask stuff and then a few months (109:08 - 109:12)
later we get this Indigo disc stuff and (109:10 - 109:13)
then we're going to get another couple (109:12 - 109:15)
months later we're going to get the (109:13 - 109:18)
epilog obviously that was all kind of (109:15 - 109:19)
DLC based but I feel like this was (109:18 - 109:21)
always the plan (109:19 - 109:24)
right like this the DLC which we can get (109:21 - 109:25)
into I don't think we need to get into (109:24 - 109:26)
the discussion of whether we think (109:25 - 109:29)
that's ethical or not to sell as a game (109:26 - 109:31)
that they know that the story isn't (109:29 - 109:34)
complete until you buy another thing um (109:31 - 109:35)
I'm sure people I think you feel very (109:34 - 109:37)
satisfied if you just bought base (109:35 - 109:39)
game I'd (109:37 - 109:43)
agree the the DLC stories are very I (109:39 - 109:45)
mean you do get tagos but they're still (109:43 - 109:47)
very separate look I would I would tell (109:45 - 109:49)
people just watch the first four seasons (109:47 - 109:51)
of Game of Thrones there's more but (109:49 - 109:54)
don't watch that that's not good just (109:51 - 109:58)
stop stop there DLC is good but this DLC (109:54 - 110:00)
is good yeah this DC is but there are (109:58 - 110:01)
stopping points where you could be like (110:00 - 110:03)
ah I don't know what happened at the (110:01 - 110:04)
rest of the oranges the new black but (110:03 - 110:06)
the first like two seasons I watched I (110:04 - 110:08)
had a good time I heard it's not good (110:06 - 110:09)
after that (110:08 - 110:13)
but but all I'm saying is like TS you (110:09 - 110:16)
all I'm saying is you you could be (110:13 - 110:20)
satisfied with the first three stories I (110:16 - 110:22)
guess I I guess my point is like it (110:20 - 110:24)
feels like this was always the plan like (110:22 - 110:26)
it doesn't it doesn't feel like they (110:24 - 110:28)
slapped a story on the side and went (110:26 - 110:29)
there you've got another there's your (110:28 - 110:32)
DLC story um it feels like maybe there (110:29 - 110:35)
were different writers for the DLC (110:32 - 110:38)
maybe just the all of the characters in (110:35 - 110:42)
the DLC are so anime Trope and the ones (110:38 - 110:45)
in the main story line are slightly (110:42 - 110:47)
less (110:45 - 110:51)
yeah I'm I'm curious what the (110:47 - 110:55)
what the epilog is wants to like set out (110:51 - 110:58)
and accomplish cuz (110:55 - 111:00)
like it could just be none of the (110:58 - 111:02)
questions that we have have like I don't (111:00 - 111:03)
think they're going to be like well this (111:02 - 111:05)
is the actual reason traffico is stuck (111:03 - 111:07)
in a rock like I don't think it's answer (111:05 - 111:09)
I think that story Lin (111:07 - 111:12)
over well actually you see there was a (111:09 - 111:14)
naana berry down there this is how time (111:12 - 111:16)
travel works in the Pokémon (111:14 - 111:18)
universe and it's actually going to tie (111:16 - 111:20)
together all the the the stuff about the (111:18 - 111:23)
multiple universes with megas and stuff (111:20 - 111:24)
as well like that's all going to come (111:23 - 111:26)
together and Ultra (111:24 - 111:29)
Beast um oh yeah of course there oh (111:26 - 111:32)
goodness yeah and I think I said last (111:29 - 111:34)
week like I don't think I think I think (111:32 - 111:35)
I don't I didn't think there was going (111:34 - 111:38)
to be more paid DLC this epilog is (111:35 - 111:40)
free well free if you bought the DLC I (111:38 - 111:41)
think he said there was not going to be (111:40 - 111:42)
a third (111:41 - 111:44)
DLC I don't know if I does this (111:42 - 111:47)
technically count as a third (111:44 - 111:50)
DLC I don't know like that's like the (111:47 - 111:52)
like Legends archus of like whether that (111:50 - 111:55)
was like DLC or not like it was a forced (111:52 - 111:57)
update you had to do (111:55 - 112:00)
it yeah we love we love the paid paid (111:57 - 112:02)
DLC versus free update discussion is the (112:00 - 112:04)
best discussion to have yeah like I (112:02 - 112:06)
don't I don't think there will be like (112:04 - 112:09)
part three and four of like DLC like I (112:06 - 112:10)
like if they're if they're actually (112:09 - 112:12)
going to say epilog and they actually (112:10 - 112:14)
put out a physical version of these (112:12 - 112:16)
games on shelves with these two (112:14 - 112:19)
DLCs I can't see like next Christmas (112:16 - 112:21)
they're going to be like well (112:19 - 112:25)
here's a physical version with four (112:21 - 112:28)
DLCs and then here is also like another (112:25 - 112:31)
EP like epilog makes it feel like we're (112:28 - 112:32)
done they're using they're using the (112:31 - 112:34)
word epilog very deliberately I think (112:32 - 112:36)
yeah they're like this is there's a (112:34 - 112:39)
reason why they are giving us it later (112:36 - 112:40)
right like there's a reason it's not (112:39 - 112:44)
included yet and maybe that's just (112:40 - 112:46)
because we want you to play it later but (112:44 - 112:48)
it might be something else I don't know (112:46 - 112:49)
I would also assume they want to get it (112:48 - 112:51)
out before for Pokémon day I know I (112:49 - 112:53)
think maybe I don't know if we talked (112:51 - 112:54)
about this after the show or during the (112:53 - 112:57)
show but like it was after the show I (112:54 - 112:58)
think I think it was after the show (112:57 - 113:00)
where where Al was like oh if there is (112:58 - 113:02)
like a free epilog or we didn't even use (113:00 - 113:04)
the word epilog but if there was a free (113:02 - 113:05)
something else it would probably be (113:04 - 113:07)
around Pokemon day and I was like oh I (113:05 - 113:08)
think I would think it would be Rayquaza (113:07 - 113:11)
around Pokemon day yeah we knew that we (113:08 - 113:12)
we didn't mention it on the podcast but (113:11 - 113:13)
we knew it existed at that point but (113:12 - 113:15)
they hadn't announced it but we had a (113:13 - 113:18)
quick conversation at the end you told (113:15 - 113:21)
me I didn't oh you didn't know no (113:18 - 113:23)
oops didn't do it on the (113:21 - 113:26)
podcast no I still got to wake up to the (113:23 - 113:28)
EP epilog trailer and be very excited (113:26 - 113:31)
still yeah no it's a it's a cool trailer (113:28 - 113:34)
um and and it's what whatever it's it's (113:31 - 113:35)
nice I don't know if it's like (113:34 - 113:37)
intentionally delayed or they were like (113:35 - 113:38)
hey we need to put this out and we also (113:37 - 113:40)
need like another month to do this well (113:38 - 113:42)
there's not an update there won't be an (113:40 - 113:45)
update before that because we it's in (113:42 - 113:47)
it's in the game well no because they've (113:45 - 113:50)
said one or whatever but we know they're (113:47 - 113:51)
not going to do that because they've (113:50 - 113:53)
already said that 0.1 is coming out with (113:51 - 113:55)
bug fixes they've specifically said is0 (113:53 - 113:57)
one yeah they did and that's coming out (113:55 - 114:00)
at the end of January so they were very (113:57 - 114:01)
they said end of January they didn't say (114:00 - 114:03)
January so I don't think we're not (114:01 - 114:05)
getting anything anymore I want to spend (114:03 - 114:08)
the next hour of this podcast talking (114:05 - 114:10)
about the difference between bugs and (114:08 - 114:12)
[Laughter] (114:10 - 114:14)
oversights oh right yes this is why (114:12 - 114:15)
you've got me on this is a software (114:14 - 114:20)
developer this is what if I as I also I (114:15 - 114:22)
did frontend web development if I for (114:20 - 114:24)
too long Steve you've been over for too (114:22 - 114:27)
longu science so if my boss was to come (114:24 - 114:31)
into my office and be like hey there's a (114:27 - 114:33)
there's a bug with checkout and people (114:31 - 114:35)
can't check out I I would never in a (114:33 - 114:38)
million years be like actually that's an (114:35 - 114:43)
oversight not a bug like I would be (114:38 - 114:43)
fired yep my my my favorite thing was (114:43 - 114:50)
like Joe Mr Joe caby I love Joe by by (114:47 - 114:53)
the way uh tweeting that like the TM (114:50 - 114:56)
thing was not a bug it was an oversight (114:53 - 114:58)
but if you go into Pokemon home it's say (114:56 - 115:02)
known bugs TM not (114:58 - 115:05)
working like the the the energy that (115:02 - 115:06)
people are putting into whether (115:05 - 115:10)
defending a broken game which I love (115:06 - 115:12)
scarlet and violet it is broken though (115:10 - 115:14)
to be like well this is a bug or this is (115:12 - 115:15)
an oversight this is only happening on (115:14 - 115:17)
Twitter by the way maybe like nowhere (115:15 - 115:21)
else it's just like the specific Twitter (115:17 - 115:23)
audience is so caught up in whether (115:21 - 115:25)
things are bugs or (115:23 - 115:27)
oversights why why why does it matter (115:25 - 115:29)
it's broken well and the thing is right (115:27 - 115:30)
like a software developer would be the (115:29 - 115:32)
first to tell you no though that was a (115:30 - 115:35)
bug I mucked up right like that they (115:32 - 115:36)
will be the first to say that that was a (115:35 - 115:39)
mistake Oopsy Daisy here we go here's (115:36 - 115:42)
the fix you know I can't I can't imagine (115:39 - 115:44)
going oh yeah yeah having I mean apart (115:42 - 115:45)
from anything we have too many (115:44 - 115:47)
definition of definitions of things (115:45 - 115:49)
anyway we have too many things that (115:47 - 115:50)
people are like oh will this rather than (115:49 - 115:52)
that there ain't no way that any (115:50 - 115:54)
software developer is going to be (115:52 - 115:56)
talking about oversights and bugs as to (115:54 - 115:58)
different categories of this larger (115:56 - 115:59)
thing that we have even more category (115:58 - 116:02)
too many (115:59 - 116:02)
categories it's a problem get your 10 (116:03 - 116:11)
free TMS yeah the the issue by the way (116:06 - 116:12)
there were there's two issu there was (116:11 - 116:13)
two bugs according to Pokemon home you (116:12 - 116:15)
can open up Pokemon home and and read (116:13 - 116:16)
the two bugs they talk about but one of (116:15 - 116:18)
the bug the bugs that the bug I'm (116:16 - 116:20)
talking about is that (116:18 - 116:23)
uh in order to make a specific TM which (116:20 - 116:25)
is I think for metal (116:23 - 116:28)
sound which is a a good good good TM U (116:25 - 116:29)
if you have a golden go for raids you (116:28 - 116:33)
should have metal sound on it uh is (116:29 - 116:36)
that the either Cranidos or shieldon (116:33 - 116:39)
drops the materials but they programmed (116:36 - 116:43)
it for just like both being shieldon (116:39 - 116:47)
so uh Cranidos doesn't drop anything (116:43 - 116:49)
because the game thinks it's shield on (116:47 - 116:51)
and (116:49 - 116:53)
it's not shield on so it just doesn't (116:51 - 116:55)
drop any materials so one version of the (116:53 - 116:58)
game I could have that backwards one (116:55 - 116:59)
version of the game can't get the TM for (116:58 - 117:01)
metal sound because it's not dropping I (116:59 - 117:03)
think Scarlet yeah I think it is Scarlet (117:01 - 117:04)
I think you're right I think it's (117:03 - 117:06)
Scarlet yeah (117:04 - 117:10)
so so Joe was like it's an oversight (117:06 - 117:12)
they just forgot to switch it to the (117:10 - 117:15)
right Pokemon which is (117:12 - 117:18)
like why why why is this a conversation (117:15 - 117:21)
even if there is a right it feels like (117:18 - 117:24)
such a pointless distinction it's like (117:21 - 117:26)
at what point does something like the (117:24 - 117:28)
point is if it's something that isn't (117:26 - 117:29)
meant to (117:28 - 117:31)
happen it's a bug like that that's (117:29 - 117:34)
literally how we Define bugs that's a (117:31 - 117:36)
bug I'm a Scarlet player I can't get (117:34 - 117:40)
that TM that's a bug the the enk one I (117:36 - 117:42)
find is find even funnier because it's (117:40 - 117:44)
just like it will the game will just (117:42 - 117:48)
stop responding to input if you use an (117:44 - 117:50)
experienced candy on an ink (117:48 - 117:52)
that's under level (117:50 - 117:54)
30 oh sorry if you level it to under (117:52 - 117:56)
level 30 so if it's like level 29 and (117:54 - 117:58)
you use an XL on it it'll be fine but (117:56 - 118:01)
it's level one and use an small on it no (117:58 - 118:03)
it just stops responding to input uh (118:01 - 118:05)
here's a pro tip for ink actually (118:03 - 118:06)
because some people are like it's not (118:05 - 118:08)
working this is the same issue in sword (118:06 - 118:10)
and shield it's not an issue it's just (118:08 - 118:11)
nothing is (118:10 - 118:14)
clear um if you are playing it's an (118:11 - 118:17)
oversight actually it's actually not a (118:14 - 118:18)
bug just an oversight an oversight by (118:17 - 118:20)
you the player (118:18 - 118:23)
player if you are playing with a Pro (118:20 - 118:26)
Controller you need to uh hold your (118:23 - 118:29)
switch upside down to evolve ink but it (118:26 - 118:31)
if you have a Pro Controller enabled it (118:29 - 118:33)
disables gyro which is why it's not (118:31 - 118:35)
working so you have to disconnect your (118:33 - 118:37)
Pro Controller and you have to (118:35 - 118:39)
physically attach your joycons and then (118:37 - 118:41)
flip it upside down if the joycons are (118:39 - 118:43)
on and the Pro Controller still (118:41 - 118:44)
connected it's still not going to work (118:43 - 118:45)
you have to disconnect the Pro (118:44 - 118:47)
Controller make sure the joycons are (118:45 - 118:49)
connected then flip it and then give it (118:47 - 118:54)
the the candy to evolve it like it like (118:49 - 118:56)
everyone who's like it's not working I'm (118:54 - 118:57)
like do you have a Pro Controller (118:56 - 118:58)
attached and they were like yes and I'm (118:57 - 119:00)
like you you need to disconnect it (118:58 - 119:02)
because it's it's taking priority over (119:00 - 119:04)
the (119:02 - 119:08)
gyroscope oversight though not a (119:04 - 119:10)
book yeah I had the same thing because (119:08 - 119:14)
I've got a uh Nitro deck which has Gyro (119:10 - 119:16)
in it but it emulates a Pro Controller (119:14 - 119:20)
so I had to attach joycons as well (119:16 - 119:22)
so (119:20 - 119:25)
fun uh I think that's our episode uh two (119:22 - 119:30)
hours poof long uh I'm this is not the (119:25 - 119:32)
the rest I I feel like there's probably (119:30 - 119:35)
things we didn't talk about um if and (119:32 - 119:37)
there's a whole epilog to look forward (119:35 - 119:39)
to yeah we'll probably do the same thing (119:37 - 119:42)
where we'll give you guys a full week (119:39 - 119:43)
for the before we talk about on the show (119:42 - 119:45)
I think the epilog comes out on like a (119:43 - 119:47)
Wednesday or Thursday of January (119:45 - 119:50)
Thursday yeah yeah so we won't talk (119:47 - 119:51)
about it that weekend cuz you know not (119:50 - 119:53)
everyone might be able to get to it by (119:51 - 119:54)
then but we'll come back well actually (119:53 - 119:57)
probably have Al back on for that since (119:54 - 120:02)
Al's been the Indigo disc story carry (119:57 - 120:07)
um and then Hannah can finally put to (120:02 - 120:09)
rest whether this was her favorite (120:07 - 120:11)
Pokemon story of all time or not the EP (120:09 - 120:14)
could ruin it for her that's (120:11 - 120:14)
true could I look forward to I look (120:15 - 120:19)
forward to when we still have unanswered (120:18 - 120:20)
question people saying there will (120:19 - 120:23)
obviously be another thing CU there (120:20 - 120:25)
can't be unanswered questions we're (120:23 - 120:28)
waiting for something still yeah callus (120:25 - 120:29)
is right there he right (120:28 - 120:31)
