it's super effective with me I have Cody (0:31 - 0:36)
hello (0:33 - 0:36)
how are you doing Cody (0:37 - 0:43)
sounds like Cody has had a day (0:39 - 0:46)
I'm doing well I uh went on a lot of (0:43 - 0:49)
walks with my puppy today that was fun (0:46 - 0:52)
that sounds good that sounds nice and (0:49 - 0:56)
also with us we have Karina hi there (0:52 - 0:59)
how are you doing I am doing great I am (0:56 - 1:02)
very excited to be on today's episode (0:59 - 1:03)
wonderful (1:02 - 1:05)
so this is the special International (1:03 - 1:07)
Women's Day episode of the podcast and (1:05 - 1:09)
I'm gonna throw it over to Cody real (1:07 - 1:11)
quick to give a short snippet of what (1:09 - 1:15)
international women's day is yeah so (1:11 - 1:17)
um International women's day is kind of (1:15 - 1:19)
a global holiday uh celebrated every (1:17 - 1:21)
year on March 8th (1:19 - 1:23)
um it brings attention to issues such as (1:21 - 1:25)
gender equality Reproductive Rights and (1:23 - 1:27)
violence and abuse against women (1:25 - 1:30)
um the first International women's day (1:27 - 1:32)
was in 1911 which I thought that was (1:30 - 1:33)
kind of cool (1:32 - 1:35)
um for some reason I thought it wouldn't (1:33 - 1:37)
have been that old (1:35 - 1:41)
and it is part of women's History Month (1:37 - 1:42)
um so it started out as women's history (1:41 - 1:44)
women's day and then it became women's (1:42 - 1:47)
week and then now we have a whole month (1:44 - 1:49)
so (1:47 - 1:50)
um yeah marches women's history month so (1:49 - 1:53)
I think a podcast wanted to make sure (1:50 - 1:55)
that we're (1:53 - 1:57)
um we have the voices of women on the (1:55 - 1:59)
podcast so we brought together us three (1:57 - 2:02)
that have been on the Pod before (1:59 - 2:04)
here we are here (2:02 - 2:04)
talking about our experiences with (2:06 - 2:10)
Pokemon what got us into Pokemon in the (2:08 - 2:13)
first place and how it's all gone from (2:10 - 2:18)
there so I think it's probably super (2:13 - 2:20)
easy for me to start here so I kind of (2:18 - 2:23)
want to start yeah um I got in my my (2:20 - 2:25)
oldest memories are a Pokemon I'll just (2:23 - 2:27)
say that my very oldest memories when I (2:25 - 2:31)
was two years old uh those Clefairy (2:27 - 2:33)
spinning tops from that early Burger (2:31 - 2:36)
King line of toys one of those spinning (2:33 - 2:38)
on a wooden floor is my very first (2:36 - 2:41)
memory and my second memory is when I (2:38 - 2:43)
got my very first Pokemon card at a day (2:41 - 2:45)
camp when I was probably three it was a (2:43 - 2:48)
horsey and I still have it to this day (2:45 - 2:50)
oh my gosh I saw my first Pokemon cards (2:48 - 2:52)
too and you can see where my little fist (2:50 - 2:55)
has like crumpled them (2:52 - 2:55)
beautiful I have mine I have mine all in (2:56 - 3:02)
sleeves and protective plastic casing (3:00 - 3:04)
just because that one is very very (3:02 - 3:07)
special to me after I got that card (3:04 - 3:10)
um I had somebody else at the day camp (3:07 - 3:13)
draw the horsey on me with marker with (3:10 - 3:15)
washable marker and that was like my (3:13 - 3:17)
first yeah it was like a Pokemon tattoo (3:15 - 3:20)
I don't have any others right now but it (3:17 - 3:23)
was like a Pokemon tattoo so is horsey (3:20 - 3:24)
like one of your favorite Pokemon does (3:23 - 3:26)
that Pokemon still hold a special place (3:24 - 3:28)
in your heart or was it just the card (3:26 - 3:30)
it absolutely holds a special place in (3:28 - 3:33)
my heart it's probably wouldn't be one (3:30 - 3:34)
of my favorite Pokemon otherwise except (3:33 - 3:37)
for the fact that Misty and her horsey (3:34 - 3:39)
played a pretty big part in the anime (3:37 - 3:41)
here and there so that was also special (3:39 - 3:44)
to me because I liked Misty (3:41 - 3:48)
um but the OG woman in Pokemon (3:44 - 3:49)
right (3:48 - 3:52)
yeah if if horsey hadn't been my first (3:49 - 3:54)
card I probably wouldn't still like it (3:52 - 3:56)
the same to the same extent but okay (3:54 - 3:58)
because it has been horsey and Sidra and (3:56 - 4:00)
Kingdra have all been special to me (3:58 - 4:02)
throughout my life nice um that's that's (4:00 - 4:04)
interesting because piggybacking off of (4:02 - 4:07)
that my like special favorite card that (4:04 - 4:09)
I Unearthed again a few years ago and (4:07 - 4:11)
now it's like protected um and in a spot (4:09 - 4:12)
where I know where it is it was a hollow (4:11 - 4:15)
Cipher and I like I Remember Loving that (4:12 - 4:16)
card and it's all crumpled because I (4:15 - 4:18)
took it with me everywhere but I don't (4:16 - 4:21)
have any love for Scyther today I like (4:18 - 4:23)
have no special feelings for Scyther (4:21 - 4:26)
sorry Cody sorry Cody (4:23 - 4:28)
um but I still am like very attached to (4:26 - 4:30)
that card and the memories um of having (4:28 - 4:32)
it and treasuring it (4:30 - 4:35)
I think I mean I also so my first (4:32 - 4:36)
experience was with a Pokemon card as (4:35 - 4:39)
well uh and it was a Tangela (4:36 - 4:41)
um and there was I think I've talked (4:39 - 4:42)
about this on the Pod before that there (4:41 - 4:45)
was a kid on the bus (4:42 - 4:48)
um in like second grade uh still in the (4:45 - 4:49)
90s for me (4:48 - 4:51)
um and he was like I don't want this and (4:49 - 4:54)
he gave it to me but and I was like I (4:51 - 4:56)
was like so excited I was like this is (4:54 - 4:57)
so cool (4:56 - 4:58)
um and then my parents would start (4:57 - 5:00)
giving me some and putting them in my (4:58 - 5:02)
stocking for Christmas and things like (5:00 - 5:03)
that (5:02 - 5:06)
um but I do not have that card and I (5:03 - 5:08)
don't really care (5:06 - 5:08)
um I mean sometimes like I think on a (5:09 - 5:13)
previous pod we talked about like What (5:11 - 5:16)
Pokemon do you like Vibe with and I was (5:13 - 5:19)
like I'm also a hot mess so yeah (5:16 - 5:22)
it's Angela okay but um other than that (5:19 - 5:25)
yeah no okay that's really cool that you (5:22 - 5:28)
still have that core memory Hannah right (5:25 - 5:30)
yeah I mean I have a follow-up question (5:28 - 5:33)
on that oh yeah um so like your your (5:30 - 5:35)
core memory is that that Clefairy top (5:33 - 5:37)
right how did that top come into your (5:35 - 5:39)
life like did somebody give it to you (5:37 - 5:41)
did you pick it yourself I just I just (5:39 - 5:43)
wasn't no idea I was I was two or three (5:41 - 5:46)
years old and I've asked my mom about it (5:43 - 5:50)
and my mom is very unsure about it uh (5:46 - 5:51)
said that maybe we got it at a garage (5:50 - 5:54)
sale because my parents actually didn't (5:51 - 5:57)
want me to get into Pokemon specifically (5:54 - 5:59)
okay they didn't want me to get into (5:57 - 6:01)
Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh because they thought (5:59 - 6:02)
that there was too much violence in (6:01 - 6:05)
those games from what they saw and so as (6:02 - 6:07)
I was a very small child it was their (6:05 - 6:09)
intent to make sure their kid never got (6:07 - 6:11)
into those games so did they not realize (6:09 - 6:13)
it was a Pokemon because it was so cute (6:11 - 6:16)
and not violent looking (6:13 - 6:19)
probably not (6:16 - 6:22)
but yeah it's really cool that all of us (6:19 - 6:24)
got started with the Pokemon cards but I (6:22 - 6:26)
don't think do any of us actually play (6:24 - 6:28)
the card game uh because I know and I (6:26 - 6:30)
will say I actually didn't get started (6:28 - 6:31)
well I don't know I don't know if the (6:30 - 6:34)
cards or the games came first because (6:31 - 6:36)
um like my earliest memories are also um (6:34 - 6:37)
some of them are like with those Pokemon (6:36 - 6:40)
cards but actually the games are what I (6:37 - 6:42)
remember more clearly so um I feel like (6:40 - 6:45)
I have a a bad like origin story for a (6:42 - 6:48)
women's day podcast but uh my big (6:45 - 6:49)
brother like I have a big brother and he (6:48 - 6:51)
wasn't a Pokemon so like he was the (6:49 - 6:52)
reason I was ever exposed to Pokemon in (6:51 - 6:54)
the first place and some of my earliest (6:52 - 6:56)
memories are (6:54 - 6:59)
um of of like playing our Game Boy Color (6:56 - 7:01)
while his Game Boy Color it was like the (6:59 - 7:02)
opaque purple one and then also I have (7:01 - 7:04)
these memories of like going on road (7:02 - 7:06)
trips with another family that also had (7:04 - 7:08)
um like an older brother and a younger (7:06 - 7:09)
sister and the brother had like the (7:08 - 7:11)
translucent uh purple Game Boy and just (7:09 - 7:13)
like I remember the four of us being in (7:11 - 7:14)
the back and me and the other little (7:13 - 7:16)
sister like constantly trying to grab (7:14 - 7:17)
the game boys and play (7:16 - 7:20)
um and I think one of my like the memory (7:17 - 7:22)
that has stuck with me the most out of (7:20 - 7:24)
playing red and blue I can't remember if (7:22 - 7:26)
I've told this story before but I would (7:24 - 7:27)
always pick Bulbasaur as my starter and (7:26 - 7:29)
since I've always been like an obsessive (7:27 - 7:32)
little child I like hated how it would (7:29 - 7:34)
be like Bulbasaur is like sent out to (7:32 - 7:35)
fight or whatever but I would say (7:34 - 7:37)
Bulbasaur in all caps and everything (7:35 - 7:38)
else would be in like sentence case and (7:37 - 7:40)
I hated that so every time I got my (7:38 - 7:42)
Bulbasaur I'd immediately nickname it (7:40 - 7:44)
Bulbasaur with a capital B and lowercase (7:42 - 7:46)
Bulbasaur but then it would evolve into (7:44 - 7:49)
an I have a song named Bulbasaur and (7:46 - 7:50)
then (7:49 - 7:51)
um at this point my brother would take (7:50 - 7:53)
his cartridge his cartridge back and (7:51 - 7:55)
like overwrite my save so I'd lose it (7:53 - 7:57)
and then add like some amount of time (7:55 - 7:57)
later (7:57 - 7:59)
I get it back and start again with (7:57 - 8:01)
Bulbasaur and the same cycle would just (7:59 - 8:04)
repeat uh infinitely so those are like (8:01 - 8:06)
my earliest experiences with Pokemon and (8:04 - 8:07)
the games (8:06 - 8:09)
um yeah I feel like those are core (8:07 - 8:13)
memories for my identity too in some way (8:09 - 8:16)
do do you guys so another memory that I (8:13 - 8:19)
have from when I was younger maybe like (8:16 - 8:21)
fourth fifth grade was my Mom calling me (8:19 - 8:24)
into the room because there was a um Who (8:21 - 8:26)
Wants To Be A Millionaire question that (8:24 - 8:27)
was Pokemon theme (8:26 - 8:29)
oh (8:27 - 8:32)
and it was um which of these is a (8:29 - 8:34)
Pokemon and it was like (8:32 - 8:37)
jiggly tough uh sorry Jigglypuff but (8:34 - 8:39)
then there were like a bunch of fake (8:37 - 8:42)
jigglypuff-ish names so it was like then (8:39 - 8:45)
there was like Wiggly doof and like all (8:42 - 8:46)
these things that are not actually (8:45 - 8:48)
Pokemon names and I like ran in and I (8:46 - 8:51)
looked and I was like Jigglypuff duh (8:48 - 8:53)
and I don't think the person ended up (8:51 - 8:55)
getting it I think they like called a (8:53 - 8:56)
Lifeline or something and the prison was (8:55 - 8:59)
like I don't know (8:56 - 9:02)
um but similarly like were you guys from (8:59 - 9:03)
after (9:02 - 9:06)
um your Inception into Pokemon were you (9:03 - 9:09)
like the the Nerds like the source of (9:06 - 9:11)
Pokemon information in your family I (9:09 - 9:12)
guess uh Karina you said you had your (9:11 - 9:15)
brother was also playing but (9:12 - 9:17)
yeah I would say my brother like is (9:15 - 9:18)
still throughout our lives he always (9:17 - 9:20)
knows more about Pokemon than I do like (9:18 - 9:21)
I feel like a lot of the stuff I pick up (9:20 - 9:23)
about Pokemon is second hand from him (9:21 - 9:26)
got it I was the older sibling so I (9:23 - 9:27)
tried to get my little brothers into (9:26 - 9:30)
Pokemon and failed but yes no I I was (9:27 - 9:32)
like you Cody I was the source of (9:30 - 9:35)
Pokemon information and continued to be (9:32 - 9:37)
all through all through Elementary (9:35 - 9:39)
Middle High School and even through (9:37 - 9:41)
college I was teaching my bosses in IIT (9:39 - 9:45)
about Pokemon go mm-hmm (9:41 - 9:48)
yeah I I'm still um so I still host in (9:45 - 9:51)
the I'm in an entomology Department (9:48 - 9:53)
um grad grad grad department at (9:51 - 9:56)
University and I host like Pokemon go (9:53 - 9:58)
events like I'll be like oh does anyone (9:56 - 10:00)
need a ride like we're gonna go here (9:58 - 10:02)
um and during some of the Outreach (10:00 - 10:04)
events that we have uh I'll talk about (10:02 - 10:07)
Pokemon bug like insect Pokemon and how (10:04 - 10:09)
they're based on real insects and like (10:07 - 10:12)
use that as Outreach material (10:09 - 10:14)
continued and I still have like friends (10:12 - 10:17)
that'll be like hey do you want this or (10:14 - 10:18)
do you need this Pokemon or do you (10:17 - 10:20)
whatever and I'm like oh thanks sweet (10:18 - 10:22)
like yeah I did need that actually (10:20 - 10:25)
so yeah well one of my favorite things (10:22 - 10:27)
has always been that I am always able to (10:25 - 10:30)
find someone the Pokemon is how I've (10:27 - 10:32)
been able to make friends throughout my (10:30 - 10:34)
life for (10:32 - 10:37)
just all over the place when I was (10:34 - 10:39)
traveling in Japan in my Gap year (10:37 - 10:41)
between a high school and college I made (10:39 - 10:42)
friends with some people based on (10:41 - 10:45)
Pokemon there uh in my current job when (10:42 - 10:48)
Legends Arceus came out I made some of (10:45 - 10:49)
my closest current friends at my current (10:48 - 10:51)
job because we were all able to talk (10:49 - 10:54)
about Pokemon in college in high school (10:51 - 10:57)
so Pokemon has always sort of been there (10:54 - 10:58)
as a connector for me I don't know if (10:57 - 11:00)
you've experienced that as well (10:58 - 11:02)
yeah definitely (11:00 - 11:04)
um I (11:02 - 11:05)
I would say (11:04 - 11:07)
um more so in recent years especially (11:05 - 11:10)
since you know coming across the the (11:07 - 11:12)
Pokemon cast Community I think has been (11:10 - 11:14)
a real a real blessing and has like (11:12 - 11:16)
connected me um to people and like (11:14 - 11:18)
bonding over Pokemon but also making (11:16 - 11:19)
connections that like don't actually (11:18 - 11:21)
have anything to do with Pokemon but (11:19 - 11:22)
just (11:21 - 11:25)
um you know I think it's uh so Universal (11:22 - 11:27)
in a way that um I've like made some (11:25 - 11:28)
really great connections that are (11:27 - 11:30)
outside of Pokemon but that I really (11:28 - 11:31)
value (11:30 - 11:32)
um in my life now and I'm I'm very (11:31 - 11:35)
grateful for that (11:32 - 11:35)
some of our communities there there are (11:35 - 11:39)
really great people in our communities (11:38 - 11:41)
who don't play Pokemon all that much (11:39 - 11:44)
anymore but it brought them and all of (11:41 - 11:46)
us together to begin with and I think (11:44 - 11:47)
that's still a pretty cool thing about (11:46 - 11:49)
all of it but I'm still one of those (11:47 - 11:51)
people who talks about Pokemon all the (11:49 - 11:54)
time no matter what yeah (11:51 - 11:54)
for sure I think it's one of those (11:55 - 11:58)
things like even if you didn't even if (11:56 - 12:00)
you don't play currently like you can (11:58 - 12:01)
still (12:00 - 12:03)
you can still relate like there's still (12:01 - 12:05)
like a kinship if you encounter another (12:03 - 12:07)
person who either used to play or does (12:05 - 12:09)
play or or what have you and that is one (12:07 - 12:11)
of the great things about this community (12:09 - 12:13)
that we that Steve has built (12:11 - 12:15)
um Steve's Empire as it were (12:13 - 12:16)
um (12:15 - 12:18)
that you like you say like some of us (12:16 - 12:20)
some people don't don't really have the (12:18 - 12:24)
time like we've have families lives grad (12:20 - 12:26)
school that is annoying and we can only (12:24 - 12:28)
play like a couple hours a week but (12:26 - 12:30)
we're still part of that Community like (12:28 - 12:31)
I don't think I'll ever stop telling (12:30 - 12:33)
people oh yeah I'm part of an online (12:31 - 12:35)
Pokemon community (12:33 - 12:38)
so yeah it's great (12:35 - 12:41)
so kind of related to that in like a (12:38 - 12:43)
very tangential way just thinking about (12:41 - 12:46)
that because I I feel like um Pokemon (12:43 - 12:47)
for me didn't really become like this (12:46 - 12:49)
this connecting Force until more recent (12:47 - 12:51)
years (12:49 - 12:53)
um and I played it much more casually (12:51 - 12:56)
before then so I did the two of you go (12:53 - 12:58)
through periods where you took a step (12:56 - 13:00)
back from Pokemon and why was that and (12:58 - 13:03)
why did you come back to it (13:00 - 13:06)
yeah so I'll say I took a step back (13:03 - 13:11)
um around uh Diamond pearl Platinum (13:06 - 13:14)
um and I think that the point around (13:11 - 13:15)
that point in my life I hit a point (13:14 - 13:18)
where I was I was like a teenager in (13:15 - 13:23)
high school and I just was either too (13:18 - 13:26)
cool for it or couldn't afford it um (13:23 - 13:27)
like it was something I wasn't gonna ask (13:26 - 13:28)
for (13:27 - 13:29)
um for my mom (13:28 - 13:31)
my mom is a single mom at that point so (13:29 - 13:33)
I just wasn't gonna ask (13:31 - 13:36)
um and then I came back in (13:33 - 13:39)
uh I think (13:36 - 13:39)
I got like Alpha Sapphire (13:39 - 13:44)
that was a Game (13:42 - 13:47)
XY I don't I can't remember (13:44 - 13:49)
I think I got X because I was like that (13:47 - 13:51)
Pokemon is awesome and then I also got (13:49 - 13:53)
Moon and then I also got Alpha Sapphire (13:51 - 13:55)
like it was around there like I know but (13:53 - 13:58)
it's just the the Platinum era that I'm (13:55 - 13:59)
like I don't know what these are like (13:58 - 14:03)
when the those Pokemon came into go I (13:59 - 14:05)
think there you go now I was like what (14:03 - 14:09)
is this okay you have bdsp to (14:05 - 14:11)
re-experience Gen 4 and all of its Glory (14:09 - 14:14)
sure sure I'm not doing that yeah the (14:11 - 14:16)
whole last year of Pokemon's focus on (14:14 - 14:18)
Gen 4 probably went right over (14:16 - 14:21)
yeah it really did (14:18 - 14:22)
um (14:21 - 14:24)
though I did I am playing Arceus like um (14:22 - 14:26)
and stuff so that was yeah that's the (14:24 - 14:28)
best best way to experience Gen 4 right (14:26 - 14:30)
now (14:28 - 14:30)
um so that was my blackout period where (14:30 - 14:34)
and I think it was just a matter of (14:32 - 14:37)
couldn't afford it slash had other (14:34 - 14:38)
things like I was in musical theater I (14:37 - 14:39)
was trying to get through high school (14:38 - 14:41)
and then I ended up getting a job and (14:39 - 14:43)
started to go to college so I just (14:41 - 14:44)
didn't really have time what about you (14:43 - 14:46)
Hannah did you have a blackout period (14:44 - 14:50)
I kind of didn't I kind of didn't so (14:46 - 14:52)
When Diamond pearl Platinum came out I (14:50 - 14:54)
almost started to that some of my (14:52 - 14:56)
friends I had kind of friend drama (14:54 - 14:58)
around then and the friends who liked (14:56 - 15:00)
Pokemon weren't really going to be my (14:58 - 15:02)
friends anymore funnily enough I'm still (15:00 - 15:05)
friends with them to this day but um I I (15:02 - 15:06)
felt at that point like I was going to (15:05 - 15:08)
have that period of not playing Pokemon (15:06 - 15:10)
for a stretch but then I got super into (15:08 - 15:11)
platinum and that pulled me back in real (15:10 - 15:15)
quick after that it was right around the (15:11 - 15:16)
same time that you mentioned for me it (15:15 - 15:20)
was around late high school-ish when you (15:16 - 15:22)
kind of expect to start being the one (15:20 - 15:24)
buying your own Pokemon games and also (15:22 - 15:27)
you are just swamped with life at that (15:24 - 15:30)
point in time so I think for me that was (15:27 - 15:33)
maybe around alola because I did not (15:30 - 15:36)
experience the alola region very much at (15:33 - 15:39)
all I know that that is the favorite of (15:36 - 15:41)
a lot of people in our communities and I (15:39 - 15:44)
I think I did finally finish those games (15:41 - 15:46)
after some time I think I went back to (15:44 - 15:49)
them after sword and shield but (15:46 - 15:52)
gosh I was not I was not in it at that (15:49 - 15:54)
point and maybe even maybe even starting (15:52 - 15:56)
with X and Y there was definitely a (15:54 - 15:58)
stretch where I was listening to this (15:56 - 16:01)
podcast I was checking uh cerebii (15:58 - 16:03)
frequently I knew what was happening I (16:01 - 16:05)
recognized the Pokemon but I can't name (16:03 - 16:09)
all of the Pokemon from alola still yeah (16:05 - 16:11)
and Karina did you already (16:09 - 16:13)
talk about yours (16:11 - 16:15)
um no so (16:13 - 16:16)
I (16:15 - 16:18)
yeah I I feel like mine is a kind of (16:16 - 16:21)
diverges from both of yours a little bit (16:18 - 16:24)
in that my I guess blackout period of (16:21 - 16:26)
Pokemon didn't correspond to when I was (16:24 - 16:28)
like reaching the age to be too cool to (16:26 - 16:29)
play Pokemon but when my brother was (16:28 - 16:33)
reaching Maddie so my I missed out so I (16:29 - 16:36)
played like red and blue in in the way (16:33 - 16:38)
that I outlined it earlier (16:36 - 16:41)
um like not very thoroughly at all but (16:38 - 16:43)
um after gen 1 was when my brother (16:41 - 16:44)
started hitting that age so we both (16:43 - 16:47)
missed out on like gen two and three (16:44 - 16:48)
um and then Diamond pearl Platinum was (16:47 - 16:50)
when he started getting back into it so (16:48 - 16:52)
that's when I started getting back into (16:50 - 16:53)
it because then I had access to the (16:52 - 16:55)
games again and I've played every gen (16:53 - 16:57)
since then quite casually (16:55 - 17:00)
um and I I think it's it's kind of (16:57 - 17:02)
interesting how how you both talked a (17:00 - 17:04)
little bit about being like starting end (17:02 - 17:06)
of high school start of University (17:04 - 17:07)
um like when you're expected to pay for (17:06 - 17:09)
your own games and also just really busy (17:07 - 17:11)
and that was actually a time when I feel (17:09 - 17:12)
like (17:11 - 17:15)
um Pokemon started bringing like more (17:12 - 17:17)
Comfort to me and bringing more of a (17:15 - 17:18)
connection (17:17 - 17:20)
um for me because I remember my first (17:18 - 17:23)
year at University I had just moved (17:20 - 17:24)
across the entire country and there was (17:23 - 17:27)
I think sun and moon was coming out that (17:24 - 17:29)
fall um and I was like so excited I was (17:27 - 17:31)
like I'm gonna like spend the money that (17:29 - 17:34)
I that I made my last summer like After (17:31 - 17:36)
High School working at EB Games to like (17:34 - 17:38)
buy the Pokemon game I remember like (17:36 - 17:40)
figuring out how to get to the store in (17:38 - 17:42)
this new city (17:40 - 17:44)
um and like uh like finding my local EB (17:42 - 17:46)
Games and and placing the pre-order and (17:44 - 17:47)
then like getting myself there and I (17:46 - 17:50)
remember it was also really exciting (17:47 - 17:52)
because when I was there I saw a girl (17:50 - 17:53)
with like the limited edition Pikachu (17:52 - 17:55)
3DS and I had the Animal Crossing one (17:53 - 17:57)
and I was like oh my gosh can we be (17:55 - 18:00)
friends in this like new city so um I (17:57 - 18:02)
have some like really positive memories (18:00 - 18:04)
associated with Pokemon for that time of (18:02 - 18:05)
my life (18:04 - 18:07)
nice (18:05 - 18:09)
and then I I don't actually know do you (18:07 - 18:11)
two play Pokemon go (18:09 - 18:15)
uh yes okay when Pokemon go happened did (18:11 - 18:17)
that change your experience talking with (18:15 - 18:19)
others about Pokemon and your experience (18:17 - 18:22)
having Community with people in just (18:19 - 18:23)
with regards to Pokemon because I know (18:22 - 18:25)
it did for me (18:23 - 18:27)
yeah I would say it definitely did (18:25 - 18:29)
um I (18:27 - 18:32)
got out and I was a big part of the go (18:29 - 18:34)
Community where I was going so that was (18:32 - 18:38)
near the end of my time at my undergrad (18:34 - 18:39)
um I had graduated like a year or two (18:38 - 18:41)
before that but (18:39 - 18:47)
um I hadn't quite left the area yet and (18:41 - 18:48)
um so I became a really big part of that (18:47 - 18:52)
Community uh I would bring my dog and (18:48 - 18:53)
people would always say like oh where's (18:52 - 18:55)
the Beagle girl (18:53 - 18:57)
um and then if it was like a really hot (18:55 - 18:59)
day I'd offer to give people rides or (18:57 - 19:02)
like bring water for everyone and so it (18:59 - 19:05)
was my mom friend really came out (19:02 - 19:08)
um for Pokemon go (19:05 - 19:10)
um and then that was also around the (19:08 - 19:12)
time that (19:10 - 19:14)
um because I was trying to consume (19:12 - 19:16)
content about Pokemon go that's I think (19:14 - 19:20)
it was 2017 that I got in con or started (19:16 - 19:22)
listening to this podcast so um and it (19:20 - 19:25)
was because I had been listening to (19:22 - 19:27)
I like Pokemon Go cast or something like (19:25 - 19:28)
that (19:27 - 19:31)
um and then they had Steve on (19:28 - 19:33)
an episode and then I was like oh I'm (19:31 - 19:34)
gonna start listening to that one too (19:33 - 19:36)
and then eventually the other one fell (19:34 - 19:37)
off (19:36 - 19:40)
because I was just like oh this one is (19:37 - 19:41)
still really good it's still out no it (19:40 - 19:43)
still is super good yeah still a really (19:41 - 19:45)
good um (19:43 - 19:48)
podcast uh but I just I can all I only (19:45 - 19:52)
have so many hours in the day and for me (19:48 - 19:53)
especially as I do play other games (19:52 - 19:56)
other Pokemon games I I liked the (19:53 - 19:58)
coverage of it all (19:56 - 19:59)
um (19:58 - 20:02)
it was hard I did move at one point and (19:59 - 20:03)
this is a question that I have for you (20:02 - 20:04)
guys if you experienced something like (20:03 - 20:06)
this as well I moved at one point and I (20:04 - 20:09)
lost that community (20:06 - 20:11)
um and then I kind of was like a Pokemon (20:09 - 20:14)
go loner like no one else in the area (20:11 - 20:17)
that I lived during my Master's played (20:14 - 20:18)
um but now that it's a whole different (20:17 - 20:21)
way to play that game yes to play alone (20:18 - 20:23)
yeah so then it was then and also moving (20:21 - 20:25)
from a fairly warmish area of like (20:23 - 20:29)
Oregon to a fairly coldish area of (20:25 - 20:31)
Pennsylvania (20:29 - 20:31)
um (20:31 - 20:34)
hadn't had an impact as well but now (20:31 - 20:36)
that I've been settled in the area that (20:34 - 20:37)
I'm in for a few years I have a (20:36 - 20:38)
community again like I've started (20:37 - 20:40)
meeting some of the people that are (20:38 - 20:42)
outside of the University that are local (20:40 - 20:44)
players (20:42 - 20:47)
um so I I definitely like it is a big (20:44 - 20:50)
Community builder for me has (20:47 - 20:52)
increased the sense of community and (20:50 - 20:54)
actually I had a friend that just texted (20:52 - 20:56)
me the other day because she said that (20:54 - 20:58)
she found Rachel Carson's house like (20:56 - 21:00)
actual Homestead out near Pittsburgh (20:58 - 21:02)
because of Pokemon go like she was like (21:00 - 21:04)
oh let's go over to that like stop she's (21:02 - 21:06)
like what is that stop and she's like (21:04 - 21:08)
Rachel Carson and she went there and she (21:06 - 21:09)
found in like that's like an experience (21:08 - 21:12)
that you wouldn't have if you (21:09 - 21:13)
um didn't (21:12 - 21:16)
play this get out and go yeah get out (21:13 - 21:17)
and go (21:16 - 21:19)
um and shout out to Rachel Carson (21:17 - 21:22)
awesome woman in science uh brought (21:19 - 21:24)
attention to (21:22 - 21:27)
um pesticides and overuse of pesticides (21:24 - 21:30)
and that kind of thing so snaps (21:27 - 21:32)
what about you uh Karina do you (21:30 - 21:34)
did you like play go and did that change (21:32 - 21:37)
a lot of things for you yeah so I I (21:34 - 21:38)
think I have a little bit of a unique go (21:37 - 21:40)
experience so I was actually in popular (21:38 - 21:42)
opinion here I was like very against go (21:40 - 21:44)
when it first came out because I've (21:42 - 21:45)
always been like (21:44 - 21:47)
um like a digital minimalist I don't (21:45 - 21:48)
like when people are like looking at (21:47 - 21:50)
their phones all the time I'm like very (21:48 - 21:52)
mindful of like my media use (21:50 - 21:54)
um and I remember they were like the (21:52 - 21:57)
summer that it came out um I was it was (21:54 - 21:58)
like summer in Montreal and there were (21:57 - 21:59)
like these pockets of the city that I (21:58 - 22:01)
loved just like going to and it was (21:59 - 22:03)
quiet and like wonderful and then one (22:01 - 22:06)
day it was just like swarms of people on (22:03 - 22:08)
their phones like overtaking all of my (22:06 - 22:09)
favorite spots in the city and I was (22:08 - 22:12)
like so horrified and I was like I will (22:09 - 22:14)
have nothing to do with this so I didn't (22:12 - 22:16)
touch Pokemon go for years and years um (22:14 - 22:18)
and I actually only started playing (22:16 - 22:20)
um in like late 2020 (22:18 - 22:22)
around the time that I discovered like (22:20 - 22:23)
this podcast in this community because (22:22 - 22:25)
all of you are talking about Pokemon go (22:23 - 22:27)
and the fomo was real (22:25 - 22:29)
so I was like okay I will try it again (22:27 - 22:31)
but I think the community like if there (22:29 - 22:33)
hadn't been the community aspect of it I (22:31 - 22:35)
wouldn't have played it because I had I (22:33 - 22:37)
had like real struggles learning how to (22:35 - 22:39)
play Pokemon go despite having played (22:37 - 22:40)
the main Series games like all of my (22:39 - 22:41)
life just the mechanics were so (22:40 - 22:43)
different I just didn't understand it (22:41 - 22:44)
and if I didn't have a space and like (22:43 - 22:46)
welcoming people who were explaining (22:44 - 22:48)
these to me every time I had questions (22:46 - 22:49)
about how things worked it would not (22:48 - 22:50)
have stuck (22:49 - 22:52)
um so I so like I started playing during (22:50 - 22:54)
the pandemic so I didn't really have (22:52 - 22:57)
that local community aspect but um I did (22:54 - 22:59)
like meet a friend just this one person (22:57 - 23:01)
who I always saw on my like my daily my (22:59 - 23:03)
multiple times a day Pokemon go (23:01 - 23:05)
excursions like out and about and one (23:03 - 23:06)
day I just walked up to him and I was (23:05 - 23:08)
like are you playing Pokemon go and he (23:06 - 23:10)
was like um yes and we like started (23:08 - 23:12)
timing our walks to be at the same time (23:10 - 23:14)
and he's like still one of my very good (23:12 - 23:16)
friends and now that there is more (23:14 - 23:17)
in-person stuff I've been doing (23:16 - 23:19)
community gains with like Community (23:17 - 23:21)
games Community Day with um with like (23:19 - 23:23)
some of my RL friends and it's (23:21 - 23:24)
definitely (23:23 - 23:26)
um it's definitely been really nice (23:24 - 23:29)
that's awesome (23:26 - 23:32)
yeah kind of a delayed start but I'm (23:29 - 23:35)
glad you're enjoying it now yes for sure (23:32 - 23:39)
are you an OG goer Hannah I I'm like a a (23:35 - 23:43)
day minus one goer in that I was so (23:39 - 23:45)
ready for it to come out (23:43 - 23:46)
um (23:45 - 23:49)
so did you get invited on like the sorry (23:46 - 23:53)
at the um like beta I wasn't about it (23:49 - 23:55)
but I was just I was ready I was on it (23:53 - 23:58)
so I was someone who played niantic's (23:55 - 24:00)
other game Ingress for a short period of (23:58 - 24:04)
time and so after Ingress and after the (24:00 - 24:07)
April Fool's Google Maps thing when they (24:04 - 24:09)
announced that Pokemon go was gonna be a (24:07 - 24:11)
thing I could absolutely see that this (24:09 - 24:14)
was gonna be huge and so I was coming up (24:11 - 24:16)
with like packing lists for things I (24:14 - 24:18)
wanted in my backpack when I went out to (24:16 - 24:21)
go play Pokemon go during the day you as (24:18 - 24:23)
the trainer in the game packing your bag (24:21 - 24:25)
to go on this big adventure pretty much (24:23 - 24:28)
that's amazing and then when it actually (24:25 - 24:31)
came out I was working in a fast food (24:28 - 24:33)
restaurant that summer and (24:31 - 24:36)
um it was some (24:33 - 24:38)
some franchised place that is kind of (24:36 - 24:39)
Niche and (24:38 - 24:41)
uh but the person who was my boss (24:39 - 24:44)
actually kind of paid me with free food (24:41 - 24:46)
to explain to him how Pokemon go worked (24:44 - 24:48)
because everybody was out there playing (24:46 - 24:50)
it and maybe he could take advantage of (24:48 - 24:53)
this so that was my start to explaining (24:50 - 24:56)
Pokemon go to other people and that grew (24:53 - 24:59)
into explaining it to my bosses in it (24:56 - 25:00)
who I played with all throughout college (24:59 - 25:04)
and then from there I formed a college (25:00 - 25:06)
club that was made up of current (25:04 - 25:09)
students alumni faculty and staff all (25:06 - 25:10)
playing this game together and we would (25:09 - 25:13)
all just go do raids together and at (25:10 - 25:15)
this point that campus is covered in (25:13 - 25:17)
pokestops and it's wonderful and the (25:15 - 25:19)
club still exists even years after I (25:17 - 25:22)
left and I'm very proud of that that's (25:19 - 25:23)
awesome (25:22 - 25:25)
yeah this game has brought me so much (25:23 - 25:27)
and I did kind of lose that Community (25:25 - 25:30)
after I graduated that I had built up (25:27 - 25:33)
that amazing Community there in college (25:30 - 25:35)
I've found more here and there but (25:33 - 25:38)
haven't really settled in a active go (25:35 - 25:40)
Community yet because things are still (25:38 - 25:44)
kind of waffling on active or not right (25:40 - 25:45)
now (25:44 - 25:47)
but I'm glad for the community we have (25:45 - 25:48)
online (25:47 - 25:50)
yeah that's always good I I'm like (25:48 - 25:52)
depending on where you live it can (25:50 - 25:55)
really make or break so like where I (25:52 - 25:58)
lived in my during my Master's had (25:55 - 26:00)
nothing around it so it was just like a (25:58 - 26:03)
like if I went to campus I would get to (26:00 - 26:05)
play basically but I worked from home a (26:03 - 26:06)
lot (26:05 - 26:08)
um and then during like the plague (26:06 - 26:10)
luckily during when 2020 hit (26:08 - 26:14)
2020 hit when the pandemic hit in 2020 (26:10 - 26:16)
same thing 2020 slapped us across the (26:14 - 26:18)
face (26:16 - 26:20)
um I live right across the street from a (26:18 - 26:21)
park and I still go to that Park it's (26:20 - 26:24)
like a it's got like six or seven gyms (26:21 - 26:27)
it's got a lot going on there (26:24 - 26:30)
um so I'm able to play there which is (26:27 - 26:31)
great (26:30 - 26:33)
um and similarly like to you like I have (26:31 - 26:36)
my advisor my my advisor plays Pokemon (26:33 - 26:37)
go like we're friends we're about to hit (26:36 - 26:40)
like best Ultra best friends or whatever (26:37 - 26:43)
um it's just so cool how I can bring (26:40 - 26:46)
together so many different levels of (26:43 - 26:48)
people (26:46 - 26:51)
no I mean Pokemon itself has brought (26:48 - 26:53)
together so many people especially with (26:51 - 26:54)
the way these games can be played so (26:53 - 26:57)
many different ways but then Pokemon go (26:54 - 26:58)
being something that everybody could (26:57 - 27:00)
access and that had that giant boom (26:58 - 27:03)
there when it first came out in 2016. (27:00 - 27:06)
was honestly huge it definitely got more (27:03 - 27:07)
people into playing it than ever had (27:06 - 27:10)
ever seen than who then had ever played (27:07 - 27:13)
Pokemon before there we go (27:10 - 27:16)
um would you say it's your favorite game (27:13 - 27:19)
I don't want to say that because I know (27:16 - 27:21)
some people would get angry if I say (27:19 - 27:23)
that but I think it might be I really (27:21 - 27:25)
like scarlet and violet genuinely (27:23 - 27:27)
scarlet and violet is getting up there (27:25 - 27:31)
for me but Pokemon go is absolutely the (27:27 - 27:32)
one that I've sunk the most time into no (27:31 - 27:35)
question there (27:32 - 27:37)
what's your favorite game Cody (27:35 - 27:39)
um (27:37 - 27:44)
so I it's either Pokemon go or Arceus (27:39 - 27:49)
um and the the reason for that is as a (27:44 - 27:52)
an entomologist as a scientist my (27:49 - 27:55)
favorite part is catching and collecting (27:52 - 27:58)
and like the data points like (27:55 - 28:02)
I don't even really I'll raid if I have (27:58 - 28:04)
friends around that want to raid or (28:02 - 28:09)
something like the the Hoenn tour (28:04 - 28:11)
um when all of the (28:09 - 28:14)
Groupon and Krogers were around I really (28:11 - 28:17)
only got some because I was with people (28:14 - 28:20)
that wanted them and I was running into (28:17 - 28:22)
other people that wanted them uh like we (28:20 - 28:23)
were driving around we like saw another (28:22 - 28:25)
car that was also driving around I like (28:23 - 28:26)
literally pulled up next to them like a (28:25 - 28:29)
creeper and I was like y'all want to do (28:26 - 28:31)
the Kyogre that's over there I didn't (28:29 - 28:33)
even ask them if they were playing I was (28:31 - 28:34)
just like you guys like can you imagine (28:33 - 28:38)
if they weren't like excuse me I would (28:34 - 28:40)
have just driven away (28:38 - 28:43)
um like a like a creeper (28:40 - 28:47)
but it's that's not what I that's not (28:43 - 28:48)
what I'm about like my favorite part is (28:47 - 28:50)
the collecting and and like filling in (28:48 - 28:52)
the decks and trying to get like a (28:50 - 28:55)
really good Pokemon of all of the like (28:52 - 28:56)
trying to get a three star of everything (28:55 - 28:59)
I I almost got a shiny hundo my first (28:56 - 29:01)
shiny hundo almost it was it's a hit on (28:59 - 29:03)
top I just got it during the event that (29:01 - 29:06)
was like yesterday or whatever it's one (29:03 - 29:10)
one tick down from being 98 it's a 98 (29:06 - 29:14)
but it's but I am like over the moon so (29:10 - 29:17)
yeah so those are my I would say those (29:14 - 29:19)
two just because they scratch the itch (29:17 - 29:20)
that I have (29:19 - 29:21)
um (29:20 - 29:24)
what about you Karina (29:21 - 29:26)
um I would say that sword and shield has (29:24 - 29:27)
been my favorite set of games and (29:26 - 29:28)
they're they're they were the first (29:27 - 29:30)
games that I I didn't just put down (29:28 - 29:33)
immediately after like hitting credits (29:30 - 29:35)
um and I feel like they were the first (29:33 - 29:37)
team so again I always knew about like (29:35 - 29:40)
you know shiny hunting and EVs and like (29:37 - 29:41)
competitive and all like I knew all of (29:40 - 29:43)
this stuff but it was so it felt so (29:41 - 29:45)
inaccessible (29:43 - 29:47)
um because you had to like breed for you (29:45 - 29:48)
couldn't mint things (29:47 - 29:52)
um like you EV training sounded hard and (29:48 - 29:53)
like shiny hunting just seemed like not (29:52 - 29:55)
that fun and I feel like someone Shield (29:53 - 29:56)
was the first game where I felt like I (29:55 - 29:58)
could do those things um and where I (29:56 - 29:59)
sunk a lot of time into like doing those (29:58 - 30:01)
things not that I play competitor or (29:59 - 30:02)
anything I'm just like a perfectionist (30:01 - 30:03)
and I like having perfect Pokemon that (30:02 - 30:05)
are like perfectly easy trained one of (30:03 - 30:07)
the good things about the raids is that (30:05 - 30:08)
you can get you can build those perfect (30:07 - 30:10)
Pokemon and then use them in something (30:08 - 30:13)
that's not yeah and that was um the (30:10 - 30:14)
first time I felt like I could do that (30:13 - 30:15)
was in sword and shield with like the (30:14 - 30:17)
max raid battles I was like I have a (30:15 - 30:19)
reason to like level up my shinies to (30:17 - 30:20)
level 100 so I can Flex them during (30:19 - 30:22)
these raid events (30:20 - 30:24)
um so I thought that was really and I (30:22 - 30:27)
also a scientist also love data had like (30:24 - 30:28)
so many spreadsheets for keeping track (30:27 - 30:30)
of like Chinese and Dynamax adventures (30:28 - 30:33)
and like all of this stuff so that's uh (30:30 - 30:35)
that's been really fun too (30:33 - 30:37)
yeah it's wonderful I do that with so (30:35 - 30:40)
many games like with um Animal Crossing (30:37 - 30:42)
I had like a spreadsheet that was okay (30:40 - 30:44)
when can I get all the fish and like how (30:42 - 30:46)
do I okay what fish am I missing what or (30:44 - 30:49)
like with Skyrim I wanted to get all of (30:46 - 30:51)
the books in Skyrim and I found a way to (30:49 - 30:53)
like in my house to put all the library (30:51 - 30:55)
shelves up so that I could put all the (30:53 - 30:56)
books up (30:55 - 30:58)
um and have all of the books I like a (30:56 - 30:59)
spreadsheet for that and I have it for (30:58 - 31:02)
Pokemon too like what I have like a I (30:59 - 31:03)
always have like a (31:02 - 31:05)
a shiny like bucket list like what do I (31:03 - 31:07)
want like what's my which is my Target (31:05 - 31:09)
right now (31:07 - 31:12)
um and then if I ever get spare time huh (31:09 - 31:15)
that never happens but uh then I consult (31:12 - 31:18)
the list you've always got goals that's (31:15 - 31:21)
not a bad thing yeah (31:18 - 31:21)
and I feel a little bit bad about saying (31:21 - 31:26)
that my favorite was go or skull and (31:24 - 31:27)
violet without mentioning Emerald (31:26 - 31:29)
because that was that was the game I (31:27 - 31:31)
grew up in so I wanted to mention that (31:29 - 31:33)
just a little bit (31:31 - 31:36)
yeah Crystal was the one that I that I (31:33 - 31:39)
like poured my heart and soul into (31:36 - 31:42)
um so I feel that yeah for me it was the (31:39 - 31:44)
Virtual Console games on the 3DS eShop (31:42 - 31:45)
before it went out of commission so I (31:44 - 31:47)
like I have the games that I missed I (31:45 - 31:49)
just need to go back and play them once (31:47 - 31:52)
I have a PhD (31:49 - 31:52)
kicking that down the road of like yeah (31:54 - 32:01)
I do the same thing (31:58 - 32:01)
yes so I feel like we are approaching a (32:01 - 32:06)
time where maybe we can do a rapid fire (32:03 - 32:08)
of some of those go-to Pokemon questions (32:06 - 32:12)
and close out for the day so (32:08 - 32:14)
we can start with what is your favorite (32:12 - 32:16)
Pokemon and I hate this question but (32:14 - 32:18)
Cody what is your favorite Pokemon shiny (32:16 - 32:21)
alolan Vulpix (32:18 - 32:22)
do you have a reason (32:21 - 32:27)
it's cute okay (32:22 - 32:27)
Karina what is your favorite Pokemon (32:29 - 32:34)
my favorite Pokemon is Ice Cube (32:31 - 32:36)
um it's a penguin and it like it wasn't (32:34 - 32:37)
love at first sight I was like it's a (32:36 - 32:40)
penguin but it looks weird (32:37 - 32:42)
but ever since that like Pokemon Center (32:40 - 32:43)
Ice Cube plush came out I feel like that (32:42 - 32:45)
just like once I saw it in plush form (32:43 - 32:47)
and like squished it in plush form I was (32:45 - 32:51)
that was do you have it so I (32:47 - 32:52)
no it's at my parents place on the other (32:51 - 32:55)
side of the country oh okay okay so you (32:52 - 32:58)
you own you own it I own it (32:55 - 33:01)
we have a few other Penguins here to (32:58 - 33:03)
fill the void while I am away from my (33:01 - 33:05)
ice cube but it's an ice cube named (33:03 - 33:07)
Harold and I love it and I went into the (33:05 - 33:09)
swim shield and I got a shiny Ice Cube (33:07 - 33:11)
and a master ball and named it Harold (33:09 - 33:13)
and I'm very attached (33:11 - 33:16)
that's amazing that is beautiful Hannah (33:13 - 33:18)
what about you (33:16 - 33:21)
I I think that if I had to choose one (33:18 - 33:23)
single favorite Pokemon it would be (33:21 - 33:27)
Blaziken that when I was a small child (33:23 - 33:29)
playing Pokemon Ruby (33:27 - 33:31)
um my family moved across the country (33:29 - 33:34)
and I lost all of my friends and my only (33:31 - 33:36)
friends left were my Pokemon and my (33:34 - 33:39)
Blaziken became very special to me it (33:36 - 33:41)
was also the very first female starter (33:39 - 33:43)
Pokemon I had ever had at that point in (33:41 - 33:45)
time because there's still that gender (33:43 - 33:48)
uh leaning towards male for all of the (33:45 - 33:50)
starter Pokemon so my Blaziken I still (33:48 - 33:53)
have I'm working on doing not exactly a (33:50 - 33:54)
ribbon Quest but trying to get as many (33:53 - 33:56)
ribbons as I possibly can on her before (33:54 - 33:58)
I move her all the way up to Pokemon (33:56 - 34:00)
home (33:58 - 34:02)
um but yes if I think I think that if I (34:00 - 34:03)
had to choose a single one it would be (34:02 - 34:05)
Blaziken (34:03 - 34:08)
Pokemon should like if you start your (34:05 - 34:09)
game on International women's day your (34:08 - 34:13)
starter is just a hundred percent female (34:09 - 34:16)
Pokemon I would always appreciate if (34:13 - 34:18)
they did 50 50 just as the base for the (34:16 - 34:20)
starters but (34:18 - 34:23)
maybe someday (34:20 - 34:25)
then from there we can go into do you (34:23 - 34:27)
have a favorite Pokemon type and I think (34:25 - 34:30)
that Cody I can guess yours everyone (34:27 - 34:32)
knows what mine is it's bug type and I (34:30 - 34:34)
was just screaming at someone the other (34:32 - 34:37)
day uh screaming with just caps not in (34:34 - 34:38)
voice (34:37 - 34:39)
um (34:38 - 34:42)
about the fact that there are so many (34:39 - 34:44)
insects in the world and they I feel (34:42 - 34:45)
like they're underrepresented in Pokemon (34:44 - 34:48)
like if there's so many like someone (34:45 - 34:50)
asked me if I like to rap a ghost and I (34:48 - 34:53)
was like another turtle wow love it and (34:50 - 34:54)
he (34:53 - 34:57)
don't hate on the turtles there are (34:54 - 34:59)
people who live for the turtles I I (34:57 - 35:00)
think I'm just gonna forever be mad (34:59 - 35:03)
until there's a legit B Pokemon (35:00 - 35:05)
so (35:03 - 35:07)
It's Gonna be Me So bugs sir what about (35:05 - 35:08)
you Karina (35:07 - 35:10)
uh I don't know I feel like this is kind (35:08 - 35:12)
of obvious too but ice types um for the (35:10 - 35:14)
obvious reason that penguins like ice (35:12 - 35:16)
and also because I'm a literal penguin (35:14 - 35:17)
and like live for the winter and I just (35:16 - 35:19)
like the color scheme of like ice types (35:17 - 35:22)
that like minty blue color so ice (35:19 - 35:24)
stripes for me (35:22 - 35:25)
and then the minty blue that becomes the (35:24 - 35:28)
like lavender color (35:25 - 35:30)
how about you Hannah (35:28 - 35:33)
I I have a hard time choosing favorites (35:30 - 35:34)
if you can't tell (35:33 - 35:35)
um (35:34 - 35:38)
if I were to look at all my more (35:35 - 35:41)
preferred Pokemon the most common type (35:38 - 35:44)
there would probably be either fire or (35:41 - 35:45)
dark (35:44 - 35:47)
I think dark would probably be the most (35:45 - 35:49)
common type there I tend to lean more (35:47 - 35:51)
towards firefighting I I like the (35:49 - 35:55)
firefightings sorry but dark is probably (35:51 - 35:57)
my overall if I had to choose a favorite (35:55 - 35:59)
type (35:57 - 35:59)
and then from there (36:00 - 36:04)
do we have a favorite generation of (36:02 - 36:07)
Pokemon I think that that is the that is (36:04 - 36:09)
the question that I will close out with (36:07 - 36:10)
unless one of you comes up with another (36:09 - 36:12)
question after this so I will start with (36:10 - 36:14)
Karina this time do you have a favorite (36:12 - 36:17)
generation of Pokemon you know I don't (36:14 - 36:19)
think that I do (36:17 - 36:22)
I mean I guess like I guess I say gen 8 (36:19 - 36:24)
just because that the games were my (36:22 - 36:25)
favorite but I don't know if I'm (36:24 - 36:27)
particularly particularly attached to (36:25 - 36:29)
like the Pokemon of a certain generation (36:27 - 36:31)
also I just don't know what's in what (36:29 - 36:33)
generation I've like never really paid (36:31 - 36:34)
attention to that so it's like not (36:33 - 36:36)
something that's high on my my list of (36:34 - 36:40)
uh things in general that's entirely (36:36 - 36:42)
Fair especially I mean (36:40 - 36:44)
since sword and shield was so special to (36:42 - 36:47)
you then it makes sense yeah (36:44 - 36:51)
and then Cody yeah I think (36:47 - 36:53)
I'm like trying to check my I can tell I (36:51 - 36:54)
can hear your computer and you're (36:53 - 36:56)
scrolling through the generation well (36:54 - 36:58)
I'm pretty so I'm pretty sure it's sword (36:56 - 36:59)
and shields Galler (36:58 - 37:01)
um oh really because that's oh my good (36:59 - 37:04)
bug types like I remember uh sis Lupita (37:01 - 37:06)
and Santa Scorch um snowman Frost mock (37:04 - 37:10)
like there were just so many good boys (37:06 - 37:11)
in this (37:10 - 37:14)
um they also and girls boys and girls (37:11 - 37:16)
yes thank you uh boy it was boys with an (37:14 - 37:17)
eye (37:16 - 37:20)
um not boys (37:17 - 37:20)
um uh Aplin loved the apple apple and (37:21 - 37:26)
line wait is that one a bug no or you're (37:23 - 37:28)
just saying you like apple okay not at (37:26 - 37:30)
all (37:28 - 37:30)
sorry continue no I think that I mean (37:30 - 37:35)
that was pretty much yeah (37:33 - 37:36)
um (37:35 - 37:37)
still scrolling to see if I if there's (37:36 - 37:39)
like the end of it but I think that that (37:37 - 37:41)
was the biggest thing like the one when (37:39 - 37:42)
you asked the question my brain was (37:41 - 37:44)
immediately like which one is sent to (37:42 - 37:47)
Scorch and frostbite (37:44 - 37:49)
um so yeah I think that's that's mine (37:47 - 37:51)
um what about you (37:49 - 37:53)
for me I'm I'm going back to gen 3. I (37:51 - 37:55)
already said I lived in Emerald those (37:53 - 37:56)
were the games that I played when my (37:55 - 37:58)
family moved and I had to make all new (37:56 - 38:00)
friends I am (37:58 - 38:05)
based in gen 3 I am a Hoenn player (38:00 - 38:07)
all right do either of you have other (38:05 - 38:10)
fun Pokemon quick questions (38:07 - 38:14)
I have like one sort of I don't know (38:10 - 38:16)
question I guess is the word for it yeah (38:14 - 38:19)
but um have you two ever felt um like I (38:16 - 38:20)
was thinking about this when we were (38:19 - 38:22)
talking about our favorite types but (38:20 - 38:23)
have you ever felt (38:22 - 38:26)
um like the opposite of drawn to like (38:23 - 38:28)
for example fairy types because I have (38:26 - 38:30)
always felt this thing as like I can't (38:28 - 38:31)
like the girly things because otherwise (38:30 - 38:33)
I'm just gonna be like the girly girl (38:31 - 38:34)
who likes the girly things and I want to (38:33 - 38:36)
be a human outside of being a girl so I (38:34 - 38:40)
will like actively distance myself from (38:36 - 38:42)
um like the girly things um is that (38:40 - 38:43)
something that you two have ever (38:42 - 38:46)
experienced (38:43 - 38:50)
um I would say that I that I I don't (38:46 - 38:51)
like (38:50 - 38:54)
um like Steel type but that's more (38:51 - 38:56)
that's not doesn't have anything to do (38:54 - 38:58)
with me being a woman and that's just (38:56 - 39:01)
that I don't I was like I don't they're (38:58 - 39:02)
supposed to be animals like they're (39:01 - 39:04)
supposed to be like nature and like what (39:02 - 39:06)
is this what is this the building of a (39:04 - 39:08)
Pokemon yeah looking at you so every (39:06 - 39:11)
time Greg mentions it like I'm just like (39:08 - 39:15)
yes like screw them again (39:11 - 39:15)
um ouch but yeah I don't it's not (39:16 - 39:20)
yeah it's not for (39:18 - 39:21)
um (39:20 - 39:24)
any reason other than nature or woo (39:21 - 39:26)
nature how about you Hannah (39:24 - 39:29)
I separate from Pokemon types I (39:26 - 39:30)
definitely have gone through that phase (39:29 - 39:32)
of not wanting to lean into girly stuff (39:30 - 39:35)
I am not a super girly person myself but (39:32 - 39:39)
I think uh one thing that really helped (39:35 - 39:41)
their two things that really helped (39:39 - 39:43)
there one thing was a manga that I grew (39:41 - 39:47)
up with where the main character is a (39:43 - 39:49)
strong person who is allowed to get (39:47 - 39:51)
angry and also still really likes (39:49 - 39:54)
princesses and wears pink for her job so (39:51 - 39:56)
continuing to like that manga has helped (39:54 - 39:59)
me over time and also Legend of Korra (39:56 - 40:02)
having Cora come into uh (39:59 - 40:04)
well become less of a stuck-up person (40:02 - 40:06)
who hated Asami for being a girly girl (40:04 - 40:08)
that also helped me a lot in that (40:06 - 40:13)
progression there but in Pokemon types (40:08 - 40:15)
uh I could never (40:13 - 40:18)
really conceptualize the idea behind the (40:15 - 40:21)
the difference between ground and rock (40:18 - 40:24)
very well until very recently I am (40:21 - 40:26)
starting to kind of draw the lines there (40:24 - 40:27)
and have it make sense some people have (40:26 - 40:29)
defined it really well and that's (40:27 - 40:31)
starting to help but (40:29 - 40:34)
if I had to say I shy away from any (40:31 - 40:36)
types that's probably it and I barely (40:34 - 40:39)
shy away from that yeah yeah I guess (40:36 - 40:42)
just like rounding back out or yeah (40:39 - 40:43)
coming back to like the Women's Day (40:42 - 40:45)
themes and Pokemon and stuff I think um (40:43 - 40:47)
you know being a part of like this (40:45 - 40:50)
Pokemon community and um like meeting (40:47 - 40:53)
some great women in the community has I (40:50 - 40:54)
think recently I don't know it sounds (40:53 - 40:56)
like kind of cheesy or silly to say but (40:54 - 40:58)
like has made me like more okay with (40:56 - 41:00)
being like you know what it's okay to be (40:58 - 41:02)
like if there's something girly you're (41:00 - 41:05)
into like those being a girly girl and (41:02 - 41:07)
being a gamer or liking Pokemon are like (41:05 - 41:09)
not mutually exclusive and just like (41:07 - 41:10)
coming to terms with that and being more (41:09 - 41:12)
comfortable with um those sorts of ideas (41:10 - 41:15)
is something I think valuable that I've (41:12 - 41:17)
I've gained through these games in this (41:15 - 41:18)
community (41:17 - 41:20)
I love that this community's brought (41:18 - 41:22)
that yeah (41:20 - 41:25)
um I do think so I kind of present as (41:22 - 41:27)
like a tomboy (41:25 - 41:30)
person like I'm not super feminine out (41:27 - 41:34)
on the outward so I think that I've not (41:30 - 41:35)
ever had people be surprised that I play (41:34 - 41:37)
Pokemon or be like oh well you must like (41:35 - 41:40)
this type of Pokemon or whatever (41:37 - 41:43)
um and I wonder if that goes back to my (41:40 - 41:45)
name is masculine (41:43 - 41:48)
um like growing up a lot people would (41:45 - 41:49)
make fun of my name and be like well (41:48 - 41:50)
you're a boy because you've got a boy's (41:49 - 41:53)
name and I'd be like I don't care like (41:50 - 41:56)
you can beat they can say whatever you (41:53 - 41:57)
want but I just don't really care or (41:56 - 42:00)
like people would and uh (41:57 - 42:02)
you know first grade second grade when (42:00 - 42:05)
we'd play like Knights and princesses or (42:02 - 42:06)
something and they're like well you have (42:05 - 42:07)
to be a knight because you have a boy's (42:06 - 42:11)
name and I was like yeah (42:07 - 42:11)
the Brienne of tartha the Arya Stark (42:11 - 42:15)
like the yes who wants to be a stupid (42:13 - 42:18)
princess but I think they're being a (42:15 - 42:20)
princess with a sword yeah that's me (42:18 - 42:23)
well and that's like I think that so I (42:20 - 42:25)
think that kind of like shielded like (42:23 - 42:27)
having grown up with that like kind of (42:25 - 42:30)
shielded me from that but also you know (42:27 - 42:33)
my my favorite Pokemon is the cutesy (42:30 - 42:35)
little like and I'm just like it's so (42:33 - 42:36)
cute (42:35 - 42:38)
um and I've had people be like surprised (42:36 - 42:39)
about that and been like wow I thought (42:38 - 42:42)
you'd like Scyther or like something (42:39 - 42:45)
like super and I'm like why like why is (42:42 - 42:47)
that (42:45 - 42:49)
um so I guess I've had like some weird (42:47 - 42:50)
experiences like that like what you're (42:49 - 42:53)
saying Karina but (42:50 - 42:56)
um yeah and I'm not sure uh Hannah I (42:53 - 42:58)
guess have you (42:56 - 43:01)
uh we are all multifaceted people is I (42:58 - 43:03)
think an important thing here yeah (43:01 - 43:05)
that's definitely the moral of the story (43:03 - 43:08)
yeah and Pokemon are also multi-faceted (43:05 - 43:09)
Pokemon and you're allowed to be (43:08 - 43:12)
multifaceted in both of the ways yes I I (43:09 - 43:15)
am not a super feminine person most of (43:12 - 43:17)
the time but occasionally I like to (43:15 - 43:19)
dress up for any for special occasions (43:17 - 43:22)
for holidays for events (43:19 - 43:25)
um I am someone who ends up in a whole (43:22 - 43:28)
lot of spaces where I am the only (43:25 - 43:31)
non-male person or one of very few (43:28 - 43:33)
non-male people and I've never really (43:31 - 43:35)
been uncomfortable with that I know that (43:33 - 43:37)
some people are but I was someone who (43:35 - 43:40)
did wrestling in high school I did (43:37 - 43:42)
boxing and fencing and Jiu Jitsu in (43:40 - 43:44)
college I end up in a lot of these (43:42 - 43:46)
spaces just because of the things I like (43:44 - 43:49)
and I think that that's just another (43:46 - 43:52)
part of being a multi-faceted person (43:49 - 43:54)
yeah and I think that kind of like to (43:52 - 43:57)
tie it together Pokemon has had a lot of (43:54 - 43:59)
women in it (43:57 - 44:01)
um from the beginning so it's gym (43:59 - 44:04)
leaders Champions yeah like first gen (44:01 - 44:07)
you have women as gym leaders and you (44:04 - 44:10)
have women that are you know (44:07 - 44:12)
like you know Misty when you're watching (44:10 - 44:14)
like the very first part like and Team (44:12 - 44:17)
Rocket has a woman counterpart and it's (44:14 - 44:20)
it doesn't feel like she is a lesser to (44:17 - 44:22)
James or anything like that like it's (44:20 - 44:24)
they're they're a team (44:22 - 44:27)
um and so I feel like Pokemon is is one (44:24 - 44:30)
of the good one of the best uh media (44:27 - 44:33)
um that has celebrated women (44:30 - 44:34)
um (44:33 - 44:36)
you can definitely find little things if (44:34 - 44:38)
you're nitpicking or if you're focusing (44:36 - 44:41)
on other yeah there are things to (44:38 - 44:43)
complain about there are things to uh (44:41 - 44:45)
say could be improved but I've always (44:43 - 44:46)
loved that there have been female Gym (44:45 - 44:48)
Leaders the whole way through yep even (44:46 - 44:50)
when you couldn't be a female character (44:48 - 44:51)
in the game yourself at the very very (44:50 - 44:53)
beginning there have been female Gym (44:51 - 44:56)
Leaders the whole way through yeah (44:53 - 44:57)
yeah I feel like that's a nice a nice (44:56 - 45:01)
note to end on I agree (44:57 - 45:04)
