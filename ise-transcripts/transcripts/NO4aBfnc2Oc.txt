what's up everyone welcome to the 420th episode of the pokemon podcast our 10 year anniversary should have been 520 i think but what 52 weeks a year 10 years 520 episodes yeah should have been 520. because you got lazy in the middle in there lazy probably yes but also like there is like a year that you're like nah dawg no that was like second year of me doing it still am i wrong no you're not wrong but there's also like every fall we technically have like four weeks of non-numbered episodes because of games very true and then where there was like the episode there was like 18 episodes before episode 300 or something when you kept putting that off yeah 10-year anniversary uh i'm your host sbj greg also here i am here and it is ultra dragon week where you can go hunt for an ultra shiny raymond quasar if any of you would bother to invite me to a raid quit all you i'm blaming you all not a single one of you have sent me a request what's a raymond quasar it's something for my age yeah ah that's a movie i've never seen you're not missing much uh well also here yeah i uh obviously have made it back from kentucky a live ish boy oh boy i the con crud got me even without the con it's amazing do you down i was like basically did you not sanitize did you not mask oh dude i was mask for mask bro i was my hands were dried out from hand sanitizer and soap washing i i just i don't know it was just my time i'll remember will's last episode this is it right here that's it 420 going out in a blaze of glory well there you go you said it bud all right well we got a lot of uh news this week and uh we recorded right before pokemon go fest so we didn't give you our thoughts or impressions on go fest i guess i guess we'll just start there uh there is a makeup hour well it's like three hours for go fest so this is off niantic's website pokemon pokemongolive.com due to technical issues that occurred during go fest habitat blocks that would be uh saturday we are holding a makeup event on august 16th from 11 to 2 local time during this makeup event some pokemon featured during the event will be featured more frequently note this makeup event is only for people who purchased a go ticket pokemon featured during the go fest water fire and friendship habitats will be appearing more in the wild incense will be more effective certain pokemon will only appear when tracted by incense which i think was mostly unknown uh there will be a special free box including two incense and two remote raid passes give you a three hour event give you two incense please no players can claim these box only if they have fewer than three remote raid passes in their bag gifts opening during the event will contain rare candy incense will last for one hour so at 11 it will be the fire biome 12 will be water and one will be friendship i believe if you remember correctly the battle biome included gibbel i guess we're not getting gibble unless they actually slightly change it but they don't say they're doing that thank you for your understanding and your appreciation for your continued passion of pokemon go well i'm happy they're doing this as i did not get to play any of go fest so and i did buy a ticket you spent that 15 bucks up i certainly did you still have your quest lines though right yes i do did they make them easier or is it the same uh it's all like get 20 of this get to you know that so i don't think they made it any easier okay all right well uh in about two years when you get your victimized i'm sure someone will trade me a victini if i really want one you can't trade you can't trade victims oh no you're locked out well there you go i mean i'll get it eventually get my genus act well genesect's coming back to raids too you should work on your genesect quest i'm like at the final step but don't redeem your genesect until genocide week starts because then you'll have the chance for a shiny oh that's the 200 iq i don't think i'm close to finishing up the genesect real quick which one what is what is it called anyways it's called maybe i finished throwback challenge champion i have to look throwback challenge champion uh i'm on the battle 15 trainers or whatever yeah okay so before we get to the genesect stuff thousand years slumber i streamed go fest so thank you to everyone who came out i purchased a lot of equipment to do that and it it worked uh but i did i watched some of it yeah it worked better than i thought minus uh sunday sunday we had way more technical issues than saturday but saturday was good so i i have my thoughts and opinions i went to this was my fourth go fest i went to all of them greg this was your first sec with us last year last year oh yeah did you guys share a hotel room we did oh wow i can't even believe the stab in my back oh so tired you are so awful i'm crushed no this is my doing my second this is my second and not as good as my first go fest oh you didn't like it as much well when i was alone because my standard go fest partner went to a wedding yeah sorry about that and all my other people were like we're not leaving the house uh so i went to the art park by myself um there was a lot of people playing there so as usual like i didn't miss out on any of the things just without one it's just not as much fun if you're by yourself yes like walking around the park it's just like i mean here i am well it can be if you if you like queue up with podcasts and stuff and you're just in the zone where you're like yeah i mean i was i was there i was you know i was in my doing my own stuff uh it's also harder because you can't get close to people to find out what they're doing like it's just a weird time to like as like hollering across are you doing this raid because you don't want to get near them i was a little like i felt like the hour-long biomes was too much regular go fest i could walk between them like oh i have a thing to go do this i'll walk down there and i was moving and i was doing other things and i was making choices this one since it was every hour it was like well i've caught what i need and now i have to wait out another half an hour so i'm just gonna keep walking and trying to find chinese which i found exactly zero the entire weekend i would maybe have liked it if it would have cut over every half hour or 45 minutes just so that we got to see all the things cycle more i thought the quests were fine like they weren't difficult to do i was out walking around it was just due to the state of the world not as much fun i didn't i can't say my only complaints i felt that the biomes lasted too long yeah i liked the our biome but when you when you compare it to if you didn't go to go fest there are biomes that exist and so if you want irene really wanted to banari last year but the benari was only spawning like next to the snow biome yeah it wasn't i wanted the she hung out a lot over there i was trying to catch a shiny rosalia so i spent like four hours walking around the grass biome and uh will really wanted shiny abra so he was hanging out in the trading biome even though abra was not technical well it was shiny for about like 10 minutes and then they turned it off but it's also a different like it's such a different vibe than all of these people coming to one location and that energy of everybody being excited and for sure doing the same thing whereas me walking alone in a park with with everybody on their phones it was hard to be like are you doing you doing the thing are you i can't get close to you to look yeah so then the question is greg did you think it was worth 15 bucks i thought 15 bucks was too expensive is victini not worth fifteen dollars to you greg victini's worth twenty dollars i mean you also gotta me too i did yeah from the battle stuff did you not get your mewtwo oh yeah i did i forgot about that i already have you two yeah but not a shadow mewtwo no i purified it so i don't again here comes the sulfur not to get you well what are they gonna do i i a person who enjoyed my xd's gales of darknesses know the power of opening my pokemon's heart to friendship again and that is what i do because my pokemon and i are friends not tools like you two treat them and keep them shadowy and evil i thought friendship is you know i couldn't say that i didn't i didn't leave the event thinking well i was ripped off 15 is fine again it's like it's kind of like the pokemon home issue like wow it's at the very upper limit of what i would have been willing to pay i think although i do like the i do like the victinish stuff that came yeah at the end like i forgot you were getting 15 at the end i was like oh this is the same for uh like the reggie gigas or the or the genesect of you know is is a single pokemon worth this amount of money but i think a lot of times people forget you get the stardust you get the experience you get the more rare pokemon like for the genesect event i think you got durant and the hey uh eight dollars is cheaper than flying too yeah i'm glad all that experience can help me pay my rent oh my gosh but i i think of it like uh like going to a state fair going to a movie uh and i think that the the 15 for me definitely felt like i got my money's worth i did like that both days felt different both days felt different i was a little no annoyed the second day trying to find the right generals to fight like spending 15 minutes oh the team leaders throw up the hunts to find them no that is not thrilling that is me stomping around and hoping that this time the balloon or the stop that has suddenly finally shown up will have the right person like i was stuck in a sierra arlo loop for an hour and a half it's very frustrating i sat in my car though at that point i'm like you know what i i need some easy because it was a war oh my god sunday was incredibly hot it was i was dripping sweat yeah it was real unpleasant down in kentucky too don't you mind i mean i think unlike go fast last year which was like you paid for one day and then you did everything that one day which was like 25 bucks yeah having the two was fine like it i was a little reluctant to go back out on sunday because i was very worn out from spending six hours in the sun on saturday i was like oh do i really want to do this but i'm like i could sit home but then it would literally i would be on my phone for probably the eight hours trying to get everything done so i was like i'll just go to the park and i'll be able to do it in three hours which took me four but whatever i mean i enjoyed it i again all of these things are i look at all these community days these events as time to spend with my friends and when i can't do that i just enjoy it less that's reasonable i think you can say that about any game though that's like pretty much anything like i haven't touched i haven't i haven't touched my magic cards since february because why so the the reason there's a makeup day is because there were issues specifically in uh the asia area where i guess the biomes weren't activating properly and then i there was the only issue i had throughout the two days was on i think my saturday was like flawless issue wise but on sunday there was like maybe 20 minutes where the game was just super sluggish and when i when i asked other people they were like oh yeah it's sluggish for me too because i was like i don't know if it's my internet i don't know if it's where i'm standing i don't know if it's my phone i was having remote i was having the remote raid lockup problem where i would be in a remote raid and then either everything of mine got knocked out and then it just froze and it wouldn't break into another team out you had to like force with the app and then reach yeah and then rejoin um i had that too i mean that sounds like traditional pokemon go a real experience um and i got some i got some of the thing where everything disappears off the screen for 30 seconds and then suddenly everything's back i had that a couple of times i had a little bit of sluggishness right right at the beginning of the morning right when i got to the park it was real it was real like oh boy i hope this isn't my day today but they bit picked back up uh will didn't play but well there was a cool thing where um inside the app there was little meters that were filling uh so it'd be it would be like send a million gifts when it worked but when when you could you could see the meter fill and then when it did fill professor willow would pop up being like hey we're activating the next bonus which is like double stardust or double xp so that was like brand new to that event they didn't have that yeah well they kind of had that at um older go fest but they were on like monitors in the team lodges yeah they were able to incorporate it in the app which is cool i don't know how many people check that kind of stuff because there's a lot of players that are like fear of missing out so they're like i cannot stop moving because i need to get all the shinies in the world i did have the problem where i got into my friends list at 11 am it crashed and then i could not re-access my friends list until about 2 30. really yeah i mean i was locked i was locked out and i managed to get because i had that one where you had to make one new friend and i was like hey people send me your you know is that very all these people sent me friend requests they weren't really heartfelt oh no also fyi if if you're listening to the podcast and you follow me on twitter and you see me say hey here's my friend card i need i have space tell me who you are yeah none of your names match up and that's like it's like oh i sent it to you and i'm like you did because i now have i literally have 150 requests in my thing and if you did not reach out to me i am not clicking accept because i don't know who you are the switch problem where it's like you have four mics and they all have like bowser silhouettes and you're like well i don't know which bowser is the which bowser is the real mic it's like just tell me your name i keep mine consistent for a reason like just let me know and i will absolutely make sure that you're in my friends list i will not make sure that i'm sending you gifts because i don't play the game as much anymore and i'm working down the list so uh every day i do i send gifts every day but i'm working down my list so that i can build up the friendship so once i get to best friends i can keep moving down the list so if i haven't touched your thing in two years tell me what your name is and i'll move you up on the list but when you but it's like rudeboy40 i'm like literally most of my friends pretty much yeah my sister who this is just just a very casual example my sister was really addicted to pokemon go when it came out she was actually a higher level than me for quite a while oh burn um and then she she stopped playing around gen 2 when gen 2 dropped which was in the winter in wisconsin so there's a lot of reason not to play she texted me the morning of and she said are you playing pokemon today and i said yeah i'm playing downtown and then she proceeded not to say anything and then after the event uh on saturday i said i asked her if she bought a ticket cause that's what i assumed she was asking and she said uh yeah i got a ticket i'm kind of mad that they weren't giving away a legendary this year i already have charizard venusaur and blastoise um so i i told her that there that there's there are legendaries the second day because she this she doesn't even have twitter i don't even think she has a facebook like she she does no social media oh she's living the dream tell me how to get into her world she has uh three kids so her well you know she's not worried about all that kind of stuff so i'm sure i'm sure she purified her shadow mewtwo too uh because she didn't really don't she's the biggest mistake ever i read its heart she didn't read the silth road so anyways after after sunday i said how was your go fest and she said i got all my legendary smiley face and i said do you think it was worth 15 and her response was day one i questioned it because i already have the beginning gen 1 evolution so i was like was that it you think if you're paying for something you'd get rare pokemon so you couldn't get without a ticket so yeah it ended up being worth it only because i didn't have those pokemon and without the fest i wouldn't be able to get them i enjoy playing the game more when they have those fun events and challenges and then i said there's a makeup day and she said oh it wasn't broken for me oh there you go well but i was like well you should probably do it i don't think she realizes that like gibbel is rare i don't think i think i think she is she's literally that person that like catches one pokemon and she's like i have it now i'm done well what what more do you need oh it's true it's true what more do you need yeah but yeah so saturday night she was bummed because she was like we're all the legendary pokemon and then on sunday she got four legendaries and a mythical so to hear it was worth it i think from what i saw the only complaints i saw were people that were like this was supposed to be shiny fest were all my shinies yeah i mean additionally that's what happens i mean i didn't get any so the silph road data mined and they said the odds were very much the same as it always has been for gofest i mean i went to go fest last year i got two shinies the entire eight hour 10 hours however much was i got 30 this time but over the course of two days and yeah that's rng yeah i didn't see i didn't i honestly didn't see a lot of people complaining that uh over that they didn't get shinies i saw a lot of people complaining about slowdowns about the raid lockups the having to quit the app to jump back in things that have happened at other go-fests that still haven't been fixed and i think that's a slightly legitimate complaint but yeah you know this is coming you know how many people are playing and it may not be something they can't fix it could just be everybody accesses at the same time but when i had like when i was in the height of the hey willow needs us to send gifts and i'm literally barred from my friends list for three hours i i can see the complaints like that was frustrating we still hit it but it was like i would love to send guests i would love to send a lot of gifts because i'm getting them but i literally cannot get into my friends list and i couldn't for three hours i wonder what like determines that it's account based or server based or yeah it could be like which virtual server you are attached to or something like that i saw some complaints of people saying like why even buy the ticket if the spawns were the same i don't know if those people actually know what they're talking about i don't know what that means because like people were upset that the the incense and the ticket were like really only giving you like unknown and like a few other pokemon oh so they were like well why buy the ticket if if non-players are or not non-paying people are getting the same spawns but to me i played so i didn't want to turn an incense on while i was setting so i didn't start the days until noon stream wise so my my plan you missed it i streamed from 12 to 8 both days so i was like well that's 18 hours i'm live i'm walking around the heat with the giant backpack on i don't i don't need to attack on an extra two hours both days like so while i was setting up from like 10 to 12 i didn't use an incense because i was like well i'm not like i'm setting up equipment i'm like packing a lunch i'm getting dressed i'm doing all that so but i'll have a pokeball plus and every time i walk back to the couch where my phone is sitting i'll check the spawns obviously i'll be driving as well so i don't want to have an incense on when i'm driving that's just wasting it so i'm just not going to pop an incense until i get to the park and it was so when so the event starts at ten and then it ends at eight and then obviously after eight it goes back to normal spawns for the rest of the night so i don't know what these people are talking about i don't know if like somebody was like with it somebody like was with a ticket was playing somebody with a non-ticket and the non-ticket person like unless you were looking at that person's phone the whole time or that non-ticket person was like yeah i also found a gimbal here but yeah for me it was a night and day different the spawns were like yeah without a without the incense yeah sure i found like a chimecho and a chancey and stuff in my house but as soon as i popped it on like the spawns were significantly better and more and and i don't know i i those complaints were weird to me i don't know if those were like specifically like tunnel vision complaints where they their friend just said they had good spawns or were considering chancey a good spawn i don't i'm not sure but when i turn on the incense from playing two hours with it as a ticket in my like it just it just seemed like the incense definitely gave you way way better stuff i don't know why you would play this event without it on i just think people who people who want to complain will find something to complain about whether it's completely divorced from reality or not there you go if that's if that's the most they had to complain about then what a successful event it was yeah i guess it was like the people looking for sort of joke complaints and they're like did you see the title screen it's like oh gosh where are we who cares about the title screen man this is what you're hanging your head on uh and then the the cool thing that i think a lot of people missed is niantic promise to donate at least five million dollars to charity after the event of go fest they have announced since then uh because they sold so many tickets that they're donating a minimum of 10 million dollars to charity that's awesome i i think though there there's no doubt well there's no doubt because i saw people that worked at niantic tweet about they're very excited for go fest next year so i there's no doubt that there's going to be a go fest next year but i i think they're i think they cannot do an irl go fest without offering a digital go vest to people who can't travel what makes you think that why would they walk away from all that money well there is that you are right if they can if they can still do a a physical go fest which i i think they probably still want to do that um and then charge you know whatever 25 for the day gosh how would they even do that so if they're charging 15 for two days they were charging 25 for a day if they're doing like go fest is three days friday saturday sunday do you buy a 25 ticket for your one day and then do you get the digital ticket for the other two days do you buy a digital ticket separately yeah i think you're way overthinking these things that like i i think the closest comparison you can think of as like a live performance concert by a large name musical artist and it's like yeah that could be live streamed so you charge like thirty dollars thirty dollars what fantasy world am i living yeah to be able to watch it on stream so you miss out on all the body odor and other dis inconveniences of being there quote unquote live 500 miles from the stage yeah well the last three go fast they do they do like what was it the first go fest it was like plussel and mine in right maybe that was that the first one was the second one yeah and then the second the third one was like they made horsey spawn everywhere and then dwarf month they made dorth month i think was rosalia and then there was the taiwan event where they made wingle spawn everywhere they do kind of acknowledge it but they they've kind of clearly proven that people are willing to pay fifteen dollars for a digital event i guess they proved that too with like the genesect and the the the richie gigas event where they were like eight bucks but those were one day events this was a two day event so i think 15 is probably fair even if you didn't walk away with like chinese or stuff i mean like you did get what like 14 incense and a lot lucky eggs and start us like you you get the items back at least i would assume if they're going to do go fest again that they're going to offer a play-at-home experience play at home experience for however yeah and then if people don't want to play at home they'll still get their whatever horsey or their wing goal or whatever is the pokemon featured spawning more in the wild i would just say it's like the the only reason that they wouldn't offer a play at home experience is if they really want to make the actual in-person go fest a premium like i was there experience well they can right they can they can go like because they don't need the money they do they do not need the money right so plenty of money from that transaction though i i agree with you will of like they need to make like a premium experience if they're offering a play at home and uh travel to chicago to do this i don't know what that is though i i have a feeling like it would be more interesting if they had the premium content on one days and then the play at home as out the weekend after to stop the overload of the servers right because i think if they have them at the same time people at the park are going to be super frustrated that slow yeah people at home are going to be super frustrated that it's slow so it may be a thing like you can access and get all these things the week before and then you'll get a lesser version of it at home the weekend after yeah i mean that already exists though i mean people at go fest gets victini now and then eventually everyone will get victini later yeah but i'm talking about like a year and a half later i'm talking like a week later sure because i'm trying to think back at the ghost like i'm trying to think back on our alaska fest and like i think about the like the walking between biomes is really cool i wouldn't consider that a premium experience i would just consider that you needed to decorate this park to make you feel like their money is good no no no no that was a premium experience i got to walk in snow in the middle of july but also the quests were set to do that right like that experience of wandering that park was tied to the quest that day yeah that was the experience that you can't get remotely yeah that was super fun being able to be like oh we have to run back to the ghost haunted forest because i need to do these things or what what was it like they had the battle air horsey is trapped in the desert and now i have to walk it back to the water area like those things were super fun i think that's part of that premium experience fairy garden heck yeah yeah and of course i like that fairy garden food trucks the premium jobs count for the the trading booth surrounded by hay barrels but next to the rib food truck it just smells like yes regret i guess yes that was awesome part of it it was like like that whole trading area was also in direct sunlight so you're like trying to trade for a mess sprit and it's like super hot and all you can smell is ribs and hay and you're like oh is this really premium i wanna don't don't forget like the little contest that they ran and they had medals and everything don't get me started you have the furthest trade and a bunch of scams oh you are just such a negative nelly okay one in the contest the dude was sitting there with a lunch tray and three phones and the guy was like who has the most magic car for the dude like let me check my three different phones here oh this phone does but still that was yeah exciting just i mean that's pokemon go in a nutshell right there the dude with seven phones you know it's just a lunch tray it was a legitimate lunch tray like it was we can't everybody can't be on the same level but i think it was still a fun idea to have the contest and assume that everybody out there is honest i mean if i i would travel to a gofest i don't think i want to go to chicago again so i've been to chicago this year so i've used up my chicago time for the year so at least i won't have to go again until 2021 but i would really prefer that it was in like lovely st louis under the arch i don't think you could service under the arch she had service under the arch has like mobile equipment built in definitely don't get serviced near that bean in chicago let me tell you i got plenty of service by that bean right now you cannot get within 40 feet of the cloud gate so that was real just the cleanest that beat has ever been you got that right something else most things have ever been okay so so i think the most humorous and saddest experience was somebody got engaged i was walking by and somebody got engaged next to the cloud gate except 40 feet from the clock because there's fences all around it and you can't get near it why did you just not wait i know no waiting we are in the end times waiting now we're gonna find out they listen to the show oh i hope so i mean congratulations she was very excited i was very happy for her i mean i was 30 feet away from her keeping a very adequate social distance and i could hear her scream how happy she was to be engaged yes and actually in uh in millennium park you they have people walking around you have to wear a mask even while you're outside in millennium park well i mean that park is like pretty crowded though no no that's not when the bean is closed well maybe yeah anytime i'm at the park it's like you're consistently walking past other people there's no way to avoid it before we take a break all the all the unlocks happened here so uh scraggy is in the august research breakthrough so scraggy was originally exclusive to go battle league for for uh a period of time now you can get you know you can get in research i'm sure people are complaining for the the 10th month in a row that they're still not legendaries i don't think they've gotten the hint yet uh dragon week is going on right now so uh gibble to alolan exeggutor rayquaza is back timed research will get you at least two guaranteed dinos i i i just yes i don't know why i read the internet anymore people again complaining about this event and how it's disappointing how there's not enough dragon i don't know i'm seeing dratini everywhere i never see dratini i personally know i know trap pinch is really common in ground biomes i don't see trap pinch in my biome but i'm seeing a bunch of trap pinch now the actual one hour walk i went on to play go not from my house i found gibbel uh i'm i like seeing alolan exeggutor in the wild because i haven't gotten a shiny one of those so it's always fun to see those i don't know i i think it's fine i i feel like people have this expectation where they read stuff like uh dragon week gimple dino and then they get mad that there's just not non-spot non-stop gimbal in their house like like did you think that was gonna happen i don't i mean also are these the same people complaining that there's not kibble in the wild or did they were did none of these people go to go fest where like they gave you an hour of non-stop gibble during the battle part of it like i probably was happy well you were busy but you're also not a hardcore player that is going to the internet to complain about these events this is true this is true people like dratini it almost won a community day people want shiny dratini not everyone was playing this game four years ago there's plenty of dratini gibbel's out there you're guaranteed two dinos i haven't dedicated more than more than uh that hour i went for a walk yesterday to play but that seems fine seems good rayquaza is back people like rayquaza after so that will go till august 7th and then on august 7th to august 14th lgm lgm for those that don't know how to pronounce it b-e-m for the evolution of it will make its debut right i don't think it's in the game do you know what those stand for yes egm is uh wait oh there's no eg yet oh there's an lg lgm is little bug monster how does g little green man and then bug-eyed monster yes or little gray man great green or gray it is more gray than it is green yeah what movie is that from it's not from a movie it's from the 50s oh yep is it from a book then no no culture just culture it's area 51 stuff i hate culture gray aliens from the have you never watched the alien autopsy documentary and stuff makes me documentary that's right it was on fox i don't know what yeah alien stuff and ghost hunting stuff i'm just not into i just don't like watching it yeah me either uh diaxis finally going to be wait is this the first time it's in non ex raids i think so yeah i think so um so d axis will be in raids uh and there will be a shiny deoxys so for the first time ever since fire red leaf green what was that island triangle island i think it was fire red leaf green right ruby sapphire emerald one of those games one of those gen 3 games you could reset for deoxys in those games 1 8 000 for that because shiny lock didn't exist until gen five um and then they're making shiny star u for that week so i don't know what other psychic pokemon there's gonna be it doesn't say but and then yanova week will run from the 14th to the 21st and you will get uh seawattle cottony emoga bufalant will all appear around the world so waddle so so waddle so so waddle i see buffalont will be appearing in new york city and the surrounding areas and then road trip genesect will be available in five-star raids if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny one and you will also encounter shiny rogen rolla rock and roller i feel like is i don't think it has it existed in the wild or was it right only it's existed in the wild i'm pretty sure i think i've oh my god i think so free from reds or maybe like eggs oh yeah i think it was an eggs uh fyi birth island is the island you're thinking of it was an emerald fire red and leaf green okay but it was a triangle yeah it's a triangle okay it was like i'm pretty sure it was a triangle it's a triangle yes it is defo triangle buffalon being in new york city we're gonna we're gonna road trip yeah i'll pick you up on the way not new york state just the city that's cool i got friends in manhattan look i'll eventually get out to new york so many people go in and go out you know how many layovers i've had in new york it'll be fine i'll find one i'm in no rush which is fun because i neither new york airport is in manhattan so neither one is it is it because of wall street that it's only in manhattan i hmm interesting concept i mean is that why because of bull markets like i can't think of like oh the wild prairie isn't in manhattan well look buffalo's they could have they could have put it in like wyoming or north dakota but niantic knows that no one plays there and no one travels there so it would have been no one exists there the rarest pokemon ever attitude so you put it you put it in like one of the two cities that have the most people move in and out it'll be fine man i wish they'd put it in north dakota that's only like four hours away as far as i know yeah i mean four hours is about 50 years in the past but you put in the city where like millions of people go in and go out a day or do you put it in a state of wyoming where four people a year leave and come i mean you could put it anywhere because nobody's going in and out of anything right now uh that's true i mean i don't know if there's anyone that loves boofland enough to be like oh we gotta hit up new york right now you look i have 200 plus bouffalon and sordid shield i don't i don't need one in pokemon go it's not going anywhere do any of them have the rare mark ah they do i have one with the rare mark is it shiny nah then you failed i don't think i got a sculloped with a rare mark though ooh trade it to me baby this is definitely will's last episode after that wow i've already got my shiny ventipede i don't need no rare markers all right those are those are the events what is not shiny oh diago palkia i'm assuming they're going to turn d'algon pakistani this summer because they did that with rayquaza they held on to it and then they made a boatload of money when they turned to chinese so i'm sure they're gonna do that anyways it was nice to see them through go fest and it was nice to see kyogre and groudon through go fest too yep i did a lot of those raids never shiny i heard you didn't get a lot of shinies i got zero perfect thank you thank you for asking thank you for sharing my pain with the world i'll let niantic know please do i mean it worked with dna so yeah uh speaking of dna let's take a break and then we get back there is a bunch of master stuff uh oh and there's champions path we gotta talk about champions path i mean do we have to talk about champions oh we gotta talk about champion's path i have a shiny lucky oddish that has nothing to do with champions that's right that's why i said it all right we'll be right back irene and i bought little flutes like musical flutes right instruments musical flutes irene and i bought little tubes and we're back even knee actually before we get to champions league years it's falling apart to celebrate 10 years uh we have launched a kickstarter with what people have been asking for which is for whatever reason i don't know why you guys are asking for this but people wanted a album of all the break music so that is that is what nick and i are doing you don't know why i do so they can listen to the good part of the show without having to listen to us oh that's so true i'm glad that you brought this up so let me know when it's time for me to make my commentary it's now i give you a permission now i steve's got to finish his spiel about where people can get to the kickstarter scam starter kicks kickstarter uh we'll go until the end of the month uh i've apparently some people haven't used kickstarter uh so just a heads up it does not charge you until the end of the month um so if you do pledge on whatever whatever tier you want to pledge on it doesn't charge you until the kickstarter is complete kickstarter is all or nothing so if you didn't don't hit your goal then it takes no money um it is not the scam that is indiegogo oh man we we've actually before we did patreon we had a kickstarter for the actual show um which was nice but this is specifically for the project so the kickstarter is going to pay for pretty much nick's time uh the podcast isn't probably seeing any of this money we gotta pay the government we gotta pay uh kickstarter because they charge fees and then the rest of the money will go to next time of going nick so nick is spending time going over all the songs again make sure that they're cleaned up add a little bit remix a little bit obviously he's been doing the music for three years so a song like uh abundance from three years ago he's learned some better techniques and how to edit music and then we're sending the music off to get mastered i i i'm not gonna sit here and explain what i i know what i'm that means i can just tell you that there's a non-mastered and a mastered version of one of the songs on the kickstarter page that you can listen to and the mastered one just sounds way better and i'm not sure what magic that is but we uh there are 50 there's there are over 60 songs um and so we thought and no one's ever done this before but we thought it would be cool to offer two different albums and then each album would have the same songs but each album would also have like five exclusive songs now i don't think anyone has ever done this before but if you want to collect all the songs you'd have to buy both albums but just keep in mind that over 90 of the songs are the same so there are digital albums of course because we live in 2020 but because we also live in 2020 we're putting out two cds and and because we live in 2020 we're also putting out a third version again no company has ever done this before but some of us like to wait for the third version if that is the third version but we're gonna we're putting out the third version on cassette audio cassette audio an actual working cassette it will work if the i should hope so two people listening with cassette players one probably being will i ain't got no cassette player i have like a set player rude last time i had a cassette player it was in my hyundai tiburon which i haven't had since 2009. i mean i don't have a guess that player or my car i'm not ancient um so so that's that's what we're doing like uh i don't i don't think cassette will have any exclusive songs so nothing nothing to worry about there but the main reason we're doing the cds one besides it's funny to put out a cd in 2020 but two is because the the the cds have art booklets and so we the some of the money from the kickstarter will also go to paying the artist to do the art for the book um and the different cds will have different art so you're getting some value there but if you if you want to get the music you got all month i'll probably remind you for the next couple weeks but uh you just have to look on twitter or look in the show notes uh for the kickstarter link or just go to kickstarter and type in super effective it'll pop up um but that's it that'll that'll be yeah we'll be posting updates i wish that was it now it's will time okay let's talk about the law a little bit which i i know a tiny little bit just enough to be dangerous here as i've studied the music industry i'm i love music would love to work in the music industry did a little study there there are three rights that artists have when it comes to music etc one publication right so the actual right to reproduce written songs you know paper so whatever people can publish them and then other people can read them another one is like broadcast rights right radio stations pay into a general fund so that the artists get a little bit of money every time that song is played and then there's the like recording reproduction right i believe my voice is on quite a few of these tracks will andrea will anderson need a little slice of that pie all right are you going to be talking to my lawyer i understand my my lawyer mr greg leatherman llc oh yeah i've been i have been taking these online master classes since march there you go thank you very much masterclass joke that everyone keeps making what do you mean do you not use facebook master classes like every other ad on facebook i could i could i could scratch records like dead mouse yep uh my two cents for those of you at the super top tier which is sold out uh go ahead and tweet at me anything that you want me to say to have as a remix and i'll try to make that happen i'll wedge your i'll wedge that into the show right before we sue steve okay perfect exactly yeah the kickstarter has only been up for uh when we're recording this kickstarter's only been up for like 48 hours so uh nick and i will probably put out an update later this week with um some more plans and the track lists and stuff i just didn't want to make the as somebody who's play apparently i pledged over 100 kickstarters in my life that's it all of them for bike products and you don't even own a bike most of them almost all of them probably hot garbage actually i have a super board game super backer i just looked at how many projects i've backed how many have you backed uh okay both of you get one guess i'm going to say 213. i'm going to say 175. 141. plus this one price is right we lost 140 you both lost so i get everything from the showcase showdown i'll be taking my new car and my master's degree in lawyering and your brand new washer can you guys guess how many things i have kickstarted two no no more than two i'm gonna say eight i wanna say five uh well steve is closest cause it was nine oh tank ah dang how did i pledge 250 for battle city a pokemon inspired art show i didn't even get to go to that you know you win some you lose some i do lose something big time lose some did i back that way back it's hard to go back oh look okay here's the real question how many projects have i backed that were unsuccessful um i feel like you know when a project's gonna be unsuccessful when you like look at when it's like oh this project's been up for 20 days and they're not even halfway there i feel like you just know i think i've only backed like three unsuccessful that but they all like canceled they all like canceled before it even finished because they knew it wasn't going to work any guesses when i say five i'd say 37 six yeah two were cancelled four were unsuccessful yeah most people cancel before it gets to that yeah which is weird like because that last 48 hours is often such a huge push like some of you probably could have made it yeah the problem we had with the music one and this was one of the so do you do you guys remember when uh i went to pax except i went the wrong month yeah yeah i can't remember that i was there you were at pax i was not during the right month yes correct you were there you were there on time i was there exactly 30 days later uh but that was two years ago and that's when nick and i um so nick is who i usually stay with does all the music he's in boston boston and uh that's when we were talking about the album because at that point people already wanted them wanted some way to listen to the music but we also talked about vinyls and that was one of the things that's what ultimately led to cassettes because because cassettes are more expensive i think per cassette but there's no upfront costs on a cassette you just have to have a minimum so for cassettes you need i think a 50 order minimum um so that's why the cassettes are at a little bit of a higher tier just because if because we might have like 30 cassettes left over in my house but we have to order a minimum of 50. but with a vinyl you can there is no minimum for a vinyl you can order just two vinyls the problem is whether you order two vinyls or 200 vinyls you have to pay for the mold of the vinyl to press it which is like 1 500 bucks it doesn't matter how many you make that that molding cost is still gonna be the same so we wanted to do vinyls but we didn't think that people cared enough or wanted the music enough to get to a level where we could pay for a molding also i would probably argue more people have a record player than they do a cassette player actually that's what these days because hipsters yeah yeah hipsters yeah excuse me what i mean i'm probably a hipster hipster's brought it back hardcore i mean i've had yes i've had a turntable for some time you are a hipster i mean you deny it all you want i have a turntable i don't have a mustache no you don't probably for the best hey what that looks good with a beard to mustache no a beard yes there's a difference between a beard and mustache i mean i will say that i've never actually seen will with just a mustache i have seen recently okay send me is is this what our our 10th anniversary of this podcast has devolved into will anderson with a mustache yes and a record player and a record player and and one of those bikes has had a really big wheel on the front and a little small wheel no you're gonna buy that one for your fancy bike rides are you talking about the one that's like really low to the ground no oh are you gonna get one of those well the one with the like laying down bike no a recumbent bike i kind of want to run a little bike because now you're in my back oh butt word look i'm old but you are the two they're like i want that one wheel thing yeah the one wheel and now that i've started real skateboarding i'm kind of off on the one wheel oh my gosh real skateboarding is too much work i enjoyed the process steve you are so lazy it's like i skateboarded non-stop for like eight years of my life but the thing is steve is gonna get a one wheel and he'll use it for like a week or a week and a half and then he'll say all right done with that move on next thing probably did okay was were you skateboarding at the same time you had a chain wallet yeah oh yeah definitely oh i don't think i know you i don't think you could separate the two i was like like peanut butter and jelly right there oh two tastes that don't go great together ah champion's path what okay so champion's path is going to be the thing that you will not be able to find it is embark on an exciting new adventure through the galler region with the pokemon tcg champion path expansion in this special expansion you'll encounter many of the region's gym leaders and pokemon partners that battle alongside them there are powerful pokemon v cards like elder goss v lucario v duraladon v and many others that's not all you'll find massive pokemon v-max such as dreadnought v-max and alcremy v-max but you're not the only one on the path to championship your rivals are determined to make it to the top as well hit the gyms and blaze your own path with the pokemon tcg champion path expansion they don't say in this press release off pokemon.com but the set will feature charizard oh nice uh there are 70 cards 15 v cards three gigantic pokemon v max cards 19 trainers and special energies this is the hidden fates or the shining legends of this year and if we know anything about hidden faiths and shining legends they're garbage they're very hard to find they did not have booster packs for them well they do have booster packs but you can't buy booster packs single you have to buy them in etbs or blister packs so i can't get them at target is what you're saying you can you just have to get like the blister pack or the etb yeah btv elite trainer box okay uh so this will come out september 25th initially but according to other sources that it's going to be a slow roll out um boxes planned like that the pin collection boxes you know where you get like four booster packs and a pin yeah uh those are gonna be coming out in november and then there are uh bigger boxes like there's a copper raja box where it's like big copper raja for booster packs a little copperage those are going to come out in like october so this is going to be a really slow release um but this is kind of how hidden fates was and shining legends i believe they they do an initial release it all sells out and then once it becomes like fall they'll do more is this the last set for the year or will there be one more there will be another set this is the special set for the year okay so is the gym thing just a theme or does it actually like i think we're like gym trainers as cards this set is based off of two sets that exists already one set is legendary heartbeat um so legendary heartbeat has the outcry me v alchemy v-max colossal colossal v-max uh it also has um some of the items that we'll probably see like heroes metal and cape of toughness although i don't know if those items are out i know there's ultra rare rares in that so legendary heartbeat is the special set in japan right now if you saw any pictures on twitter or anything of like the rainbow raiku rainbow jirachi rainbow suicune uh it's like these different type of holographic cards where it's like jirachi but in front of like this rainbow explosion they're really really cool i don't know if those specific cards will be in in champions path the etb for champions path the elite trainer box has charizard on it gmat of gigantomax charizard but those came from a different set um so those came from the vmax starter sets they were exclusive like decks that came out earlier this year in japan in march so there was a gmat there was a charizard v max starter set and a grim snarl vmax starter set and those came with vmax charizard charizard v v grim snarl grim snarl v max so those cards will be in the champions path as well i don't think we have a full listing of all the cards in champions path they just say there's it comes out september 25th they'll have 70 cards i'm i am so so positive that because they're put charizard on the etb this is going to be impossible to find this year if there's somebody at target to get his for you well it should go to target right does he carry those targets should yeah definitely target carry target carried you know hidden fates shining legends and for the most part you'd be able to find them but if you went like the week it came out but if there's if we if we figure out that like i don't know i'll crummy v max is worth 500 bucks which i know it won't be but if there's a if there's a really expensive card it's going to it's going to sell out faster well you just pre-order from your lgs man yeah i have a friend who runs a tcg online store and apparently they pre-ordered multiple boxes and they all got rejected and they had to cancel their customers pre-orders because the distributor was like we're only going to send you two boxes not 90 boxes oh dang then you pre-order directly from the distributor if anybody needs a distributor i can give you a couple i know some okay i guess we'll we'll probably have some news closer to champion's path darkness ablaze though should be coming out and darkness ablaze is the new set comes out i think the 14th of august although i'm sure there are probably some stores selling it early wait the new set for english yes english okay in japan it was called infinity zone it used to be called worlds down so japan right now has legendary heartbeat infinity zone was before that we our last set was rebel clash and so our new set is darkness ablaze and then we'll have one more set for the year that isn't champion's path champion's path is just the the mini set so a lot of tcg stuff well time to get back in i just want to do the race y'all never it's never time to get back in no no no ah speaking of the raid stuff uh battle academy should be available now that board game that isn't really a board game but they're selling it as a board yeah i saw an ad for it so yeah i've seen an ad for it yeah so battlefield academy should be available i don't i guess i'm going to buy it just for collecting purposes but there's nothing to it yeah whatever we don't need to waste time on it it's out let's let's uh let's tackle some pokemon masters greg okay all right there was a huge huge update it's finally here the stamina system yep it's here there are more stuff i'll go through the press release real quick stamina is here it replenishes one stamina every six minutes it does not replenish past the maximum you can replenish stamina by gems or by uh rewards from your present box you can pass the maximum using gems or present box stuff please note there is a second replenishment limit beyond maximum stamina i don't know what that means i'm there i'm there is it is it nine is it past 900 because i had a warning saying like you can't go back you can't go you can't go past a thousand oh okay okay okay so 999 is the max which i've been at for since it came out yeah uh i want to talk about that they introduced skip tickets finally that was uh that was all me thank you thank you it was not it was not you didn't even you didn't even know they existed what's cause of me when they asked for every time dna has asked for feedback from me and the other partners i feel like you better tell them about skip tickets because i need skip tickets in my life for this dumb game i i said skip tickets would be nice these are the games that have skipped tickets that do it well these are some examples i think you even said greg that these were some games that had skip tickets that didn't do it well yep so i i wrote that all up i sent it to them at least twice um and i think i was the only person arguing for skip tickets i'm not sure if anyone else was um there was like one feedback form that was public i was the only one that mentioned skip tickets and then there was a private one so but skip tickets are here i give us gifts i i doubt it was me i'm sure they looked at other games that were successful with skip tickets yeah uh there's player ranked now player rank will go up when you just do battles and stuff but also player rank will increase your maximum stamina so you start at 40. when you get to level two it'll go from 40 to 45 when two or more sync pairs of the same type are placed in a team type skill is activated strengthening all members in the team uh this would be for example if you put like wrote like elisa your player character and sophocles all on a team they all have electric they would get a boost there's a new training area to coincide with the removal of super courses the current training area is renamed ex plaza and the brand new training area will be placed where items can strengthen sink pairs so there's a level up arena a cap unlock arena an evolution material arena and a sink orb arena so i think those are pretty straightforward as a new player to pokemon masters there was a lot of menus to look at and now there are just four like hey if i want to evolve my pokemon oh i can go to the evolution area yeah so they made that pretty straightforward there's move candy coins so while they did make the thing simpler they added this move candy you'll be able to collect a certain amount of move candy to exchange for 5 star move candy as listed below move candy coin comes in four types so there's move candy coin strike move candy coin support move candy coin and tech move candy coin i think all of these are good except uh i guess some people might not like the stamina some people may like it told you guys all how i play so i knew this wouldn't affect me i mean so far i i don't play a lot um but right now i'm at uh level 13 uh the max stamina i can have is 96 and i currently have 845. the wax you can have is oh wait what repeat those so the limit of what it will restore is 96 but since they've been giving away this week with stamina they give out like 200 at a time and that goes above i have been at 999 and then until i use some stamina so right now i'm at 8 45 i have a gift for another 200 that is literally sitting in my box waiting for me to drop down so i can accept it and replenish it all the problem is of course every time i go up a level because i'm in the early stages of the game it replenishes my stamina up and i can never take advantage of that gift without burning through right so i'm at level 6 tickets 15 i have 108 total stamp stamima stamina and i'm at a max of 851 and just like you i have like four gifts in my present box that i cannot redeem because because it will put you over it it will put me in a good it's a good problem to have and if you play the game right you will always have plenty of stamina like just don't burn don't burn yourself down below your natural like 200 a day is easy to get everything done uh also the very first thing you should do is unlock the super level of the level up course get that done so you're getting because they added book four so you get those it has no limit on how many times you can run it and once you've cleared it and you get the ability to use skip tickets you can put any team together that you want so anybody who you think oh i need to get experience on them pop them in there because it it's not going to check like it already knows you passed so if you have all level ones that you want to level up put them into that course skip ticket twice and they get all the experience that's naturally given without having to waste any books it's an easy way to get experience that would other be otherwise be wasted on the team that cleared that for you you can spread it around to everybody else it's one of the greatest things of all games that do skip tickets right is being able to use the xp and not have it be wasted this was my question uh so in order to use a skip ticket you have to complete a level without any of your sink pairs dying right which is a little bit harder on the highest difficulties yes but is that how other games do it like you have to complete with no faints in order to skip yeah you have to you have to get a three star rating whatever that requirement is and once you have a full three star rating meaning you've passed it according to how we want it to get passed um then you can skip it all you want yeah uh the good thing about the level up drill top super hard is that it's rock based uh and olivia is still one of the best olivia we're out here using cynthia uh isn't cynthia better than olivia but cynthia's ground and not rock right oh yeah dan rock yeah no no you're right it's great nothing is disgruntled i just put those two together i think i'm thinking of hapu which i think oh cynthia is better than hapu when it comes to ground but you can just you can wreck that level quickly with olivia because they're all weak to rock and then once you've cleared it you can like like i have the bug event and my pokemon were those sink pairs were lower experience so i just put my bug team in there and i said give me 10 give me 10 turns on this one i get all those books and i get all that experience on my other team it's it's brilliant um so i'm really happy with the skip tip it function i'm so far fine with the stamina because the stamina cost seems to be mostly in line with the rewards that you get and they've been really generous this week with the stamina so as long as i do my standard and just keep myself way up in the heavens i will never have a stamina worry yeah so yeah obviously uh full disclosure i'm partnered with dna i knew a lot of these changes were coming for quite a while um and they asked for my feedback on them this is this is what i'm about to say has nothing to do with dna i'm gonna put a tin tin foil hat on though so i i went down a dark deep path of of probably tin foil theories but what i heard or what i read i should say is that the these um stamina systems aren't designed to limit the players they're designed in part to stop bots from grinding out accounts and then selling the accounts so once you build in a system and then you build in things like gifts where they gift you 200 stamina for free it stops the bots from doing what they're doing because it requires more human interaction to yeah and so the comparison before it hit pokemon masters was that this was a huge issue in fire emblem heroes fire emblem heroes rolled out stamina after i don't know how fast they rolled it out they rolled it out pretty quickly though i think and so people who still play fire emblem heroes they've never really run out of stamina because of how many gifts they do of like here's 200 stamina here's a refresh here's potions to refresh um so that game has been out for what like four years and yeah i'm sure there are some really really hardcore players that hit the limit and then they use the gems or whatever to refresh it but that that's the the tin hat theory like this system wasn't designed to punish us for playing it was designed to like stop robots from grinding out and then selling it i i don't think those two things are exclusive i think it stops bots which have always been a problem but it also stops people who who who treat it like who are actual robots who who act like robots i i think both can happen i think the human one is a lot less common but there are people who will burn through it um and then want to spend gems the other thing is we don't know yet how likely they are continuing these gifts right like these gifts could just be for the first month of of launch and then they stop giving you stamina gifts which is pretty common like they tend to only do stamina gifts uh for special events um dragalia lost built a thing where you can get stamina from upgrading your castle as part of having to interact with that menu but that came years after their that game had launched um the bot problem is real and i i i don't think that's like tin foil hat territory i think it does stop that problem i don't know if that was a huge problem in pokemon masters though since there's just not it's not a lot of pvp really yet there were those accounts on ebay that we found yeah i mean they have to sell the other thing that they've done in masters is they added the the summer sink pairs that we speculated about yeah um so we have stephen and alolan sandslash and the other one we were we were way off the mark on was lyra and jigglypuff yep my my next complaint is the pulling system still stinks it still feels bad the steel fat still feels bad to pull a 10 pull and get a solid roster of three stars that you have so many of and not a single guarantee of getting a four star at least yeah that's like just the one like ten polls just don't have no there's no benefit there's no benefit it's just frustrating it's just i get my frustration done fast other than slow and that's the only reason to pull 10 balls polling still feels really bad in this game serena on one pole it feels real good yeah well but that's really rare and it felt it felt it felt good for a while when they were being more generous with their gifts uh that has ended uh they did a one big dump for bug fixes and changing the game massively um but we gave everyone 3 000 gems for this update yeah that's what i'm saying like they gave this one which got you a 10 pull which feels bad because it's you're just still not guaranteed anything uh and then they've really slowed down giving you gems again so trying to work back up to just do a one pull is once again a multi-day process which since you aren't guaranteed is just like i'm gonna get another bryson man i'm gonna get another bugsy i'm gonna get another thing that i don't need more of it's just de-incentivizing to find that aspect fund and i know it's to drive money which it's just that also feels weird it also just feels like just blatant give us money and you'll give us money and we will guarantee it then and it's that's just i still think that aspect of this game is really ugly i i do not like it yeah i just wish the premium currency was called something different mm-hmm i don't yep i don't like that they're both called gems but one is paid and one is freed they were like gems and diamonds coins diamonds they already got they already got coins in the game i know pearls name one coins pearls no name one pearl then one name one diamond and then the name the last one platinum look if they do diamond jennifer remake's confirmed uh hey i pulled that summer stephen i'm pretty excited i have not uh i am very i'm super happy with the update i don't know if i said that i like yeah i'm happy with the updates um taken a lot of the grind feel out of it which was their goal which was their goal i think the new level up your team menu is really overwhelming like if you are stepping into this game looking at that it's like oh boy what this is like a huge list of things that i have to micromanage for this team and i think they need a slightly i think they need to crunch that down a little so it just doesn't feel like i there are so many menus that i have to click on and you really don't have to but it like they don't really differentiate them like i think that's overwhelming and could be cleaned up a lot i love the skip tickets love it seriously i love them too in case anybody wanted my opinion you don't even play i meant gardenscape skip tickets oh yes past this garden level you should log in though will you get your three thousand gems you can save it for uh your favorite sure um which is alder and victini if the game didn't completely aggravate me every time i logged in i'd consider it but it's just i don't need that kind of emotional disturbance in my life right now well speaking of emotional disturbance the power of us is now on pokemon tv don't watch it for the next two weeks you can see ash and pikachu and a whole cast of unique characters that's it we're done that's it and people are going to tweet i couldn't help but watch it and we were warning you we are warning you to not watch it it's not it's not great you all got to listen just trust us we are producing a watch party tonight you are so awful sword and shield has some new raids raid rotation happened it is uh pretty uneventful are they new really not none of the pokemon in the raids that are being promoted are our dlc pokemon um so it's quagsire milotic gastrodon hippodon dreadna and sandaconda santikana and dredena have the ability to dynomax gigantomax um and those are appearing between three and five-star raids of course if you beat the game that's all you're seeing is three to five stars you did not beat the game you're seeing one to two stars so you would expect fibas cellos hippopotas etc and these are the raids for the next 30 days uh i guess until august 31st now the question is are they going to do another wailord weekend and change the raids for 48 hours and increase the shiny chance or was that just a weird one-off thing because i think 30 days for these raids are pretty underwhelming yeah do you mean in all of history or just in the next month in the next month in the next month uh which i don't even think that like i think the way the whaler week was cool minus the fact they didn't announce it minus the fact that it was a little short it was like i think friday night at seven into sunday till seven so 48 hours it'd been nice if it was maybe like friday saturday sunday uh or maybe thursday friday saturday sunday just not saturday sunday uh but i guess we'll see but man these raids are not yeah not having anyone rush back to turn on their switch unfortunately well i'm still playing isle of armor so i turn my switch on every day yeah i made a little graphic for it i also made a little cheat sheet if you want more wishing pieces just in case you want to stock up for if there is another way alert event you can just wishing peace your way to there for the the scam-o-matic that's pretty much it that is that is all the news we got i think we went through it all i wonder if that battle academy is on amazon can't tell you greg give us our question of the week i've been working on this knowing that was the 10-year anniversary so i have put a lot of work and thought into this song selection ready i'm ready yup okay never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around it desert you never gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye never gonna tell a lie and hurt you it's time for the question of the question of the week boy getting rick rolled doesn't feel so bad when it's so gentle and nicely done go for it uh this is from franco what is the ideal way to play through a pokemon game in each of your opinion from an experience or a new player or a nuzlocke or an sbq verse alongside the anime etc etc what's an sbq yeah shiny badge quest oh ooh okay will anderson's going first and jump into the lead number one nuzz locks are garbage throw them out stop living your life that bad way shiny badge quest ain't nobody got time for that unless unless i got 500 people watching me and paying me the bits little bitties and subscription fees no the best way to play a pokemon game is to uh as you go discover the new pokemon try not to see as many spoilers ahead of time as you can and then just add the delightful pokemon that you come across that you enjoy to your team try to keep them evenly leveled as you go and enjoy the experience okay there was a uh poll that took place in on the uh pokemon secret club page which no longer exists they closed it down lasted a solid four months secret club uh that asked how people play through a game whether they i think the the question was do you play through with like one partner or like six partners so pretty much like what what a lot of like eight-year-olds did when they played red and blue they just like picked charmander and then they they just they tried to catch other pokemon but it was too much work so they just a lot of people do that they just play with one pokemon yeah so they just have like over leveled 80 charizard at the end and everything else is like level 14. and it was like 34 of people just did that that was just and the secret club was a paid membership so you had to pay five dollars to get into the secret you had to go to a pokemon center in japan pay the five dollars register it and then like like half a million people took this poll and 34 of them were just i'm using one pokemon and that's fine i mean like there's no if that's how you want to play the game that's cool that's how i'm playing through gala darkness right now and surviving i was like i'm using espeon and i guess i'm using hound hour because it's working i'm not switching my pokemon i'm using these two they're getting all the experience they are one-shotting everything i do not want to switch i do not want to level up the steady horse anymore i do not want to level up this ball toy um and i am yeah and i'm having fun that way like the espeon's good the hound doom's good i'm one-shotting everything there's a lot of battles back to back to back to back to back getting through those quicker is more enjoyable for me i think i would have a less fun time if i tried to make a balanced team because i did that two years ago and i lost that memory card but let me tell you as much as i like del cady del cady was not pulling her weight i put so much time and experience into her and her hyper beam did like 20 nothing damage and then i lost the turn and then she got one shot i just i'm having more fun this way um when i i played through all of crystal i had to play through it twice because i wanted to transfer a master ball over and stuff and i just went through crystal with a uh for alligator and that's all i used was for alligatoring it was fine it was fun um a lot of speedrunners they play through with one pokemon just because it's more efficient but if i'm taking my time and going through a game uh i like to add the new pokemon to my team and i think the changes to experience share gives you that opportunity to experiment more than in like ruby and sapphire where you're just like oh you're not giving me an experience here until very later into the game uh okay i guess we're just gonna keep using talo then i think the changes they made have made it easier to level up your team uh so the ideal way to play through a pokemon game so if it's a brand new game for me my ideal way to play my first playthrough is to do a try to catch everything or at least see everything that's on a route because i want to see all the new things uh and then pick and choose what's going on my team as i pass through and like oh i really like this design like you know snom came so late but i loved it so on my team uh then when i do a second playthrough because i always get both i will usually do something like a combo lock so uh combo lock is where i roll a die and depending on the number determines what action i'm going to take on that particular route and then get through the game just because i've already seen everything in the game i'm just playing through it a second time because i enjoy playing them twice uh and sort of having a different experience a second time through uh an alteration of the nuzlocke formula i i will say for my shield playthrough i am going to be playing with an entirely shiny bug team if i ever get a shiny snowman without a shiny charm because i still don't have the shield exclusives in my sword game are you misunderstood huh you method right i am breeding snomeds now yes with masuda method but i still need a shiny charm it's your ones one and six 682 i i don't know i i try to kill as many snowms as i can in my free time to bring that little number up i got a japanese ditto to breed against but no shiny charm still so i mean do you want me to help you get the the uh exclusives because i have them i have both games we've had this conversation before i know and the person that was supposed to help you bailed who that was not me i didn't say i was here it was you all right all right all right jeez mr ego you're so vain i bet you think this segment's about you wow what was that are we good with the question can we complain about nuts block police nuzlocke police there's nuzlocke police yeah this this maybe this happens because i uh because i stream on because you're a streamer yeah but okay so for example i i did a shiny badge quest omega ruby alpha sapphire i think or maybe with sun or x and y what are the games that have horde battles x and y it was x and y i think i remember this yeah yeah yeah so i was like okay we're gonna we're gonna do a shiny badge quest on x and y and but but they don't give you a pokemon with sweet scent or the opportunity to see horde battles until after the first gym it's like immediately after the first gym like once you beat viola or whatever her name is then you you you're you're dancing torino gives you sweet scent and there's gulpin and there's other pokemon and so i was like all right we're gonna do a shiny batch quest in x and y it's gonna be a big thing on twitch it's gonna be really fun but i don't want to reset first starter because i because i don't want to listen to serena call me master p or big s or whatever i wonder if i don't want to read that 4 000 times and i i don't i'm not in love with any of these starters also i would if i if i'm going to go for a shiny starter i would want to go for it's hidden ability so i can't do that when i'm soft resetting at the beginning of a game so i don't like any of this i don't like the i don't like the method i don't like lack of hidden ability i don't like being called big p i don't want anything so what we're gonna do is i'm gonna beat the first gym real quick because it takes like 10 minutes in that game to beat the first gym and then we're going to start our shiny badge quest and we'll get two shinies i should probably explain what a shiny badge quest is for anyone that doesn't know shiny badge quest is you get one shiny per gym so you can't challenge the gym leader until you get a shiny and then ideally when you get to the elite four you have eight shiny pokemon that you've gotten to represent the eight gyms and then you pick from the eight the six pokemon you want and then you go battle the elite four it's not like another sounds like a tremendous waste of effort yeah it is it's it's just like the film it's a field programming time right it's it's it's to make a game seem longer than it actually is uh but if it does it does give the the nuzlocke treatment of forcing you to be like okay well between route four and five these are my pokemon which one would be the coolest shiny before i get to clemont it does something like that just like in a nuzlocke you're like well i never thought i'm gonna use bellsprout but i guess bellsprout was my encounter so come on bellsprout we can do it so uh so we beat vila within like 10 minutes and then i get the sweet scent and there was there was some dude in chat and this happens all the time and they were they were non-stop complaining on how i was doing this wrong and they were like ah you're you didn't suffer set for a starter what that was howard just shiny badge quiz you got i'm sorry spread for the starter and it's like all right dude calm down look i could sit here and try to get a scatter bug before the gym too but i want i i really want a horde hunt i just want a sweet scent i just want to hang out with chet i want to hit the sweet set button i want to see five gulpin at a time it'll all be good buddy we're gonna get two shinies before we get to the second gym it's fine and for like an hour this dude was like ah you're playing this wrong i can't believe it you broke the fundamental shiny bad badge quest laws of the universe how dare i was like please here's the number for the shiny badge quest please police give them a call let them know where i live send them to my door and arrest me because i am taking somebody's no offense to them whoever made a shiny batch quest but i'm sure somebody in in their bedroom in their parents house that was like this is a fun way to play i'm gonna type this up and put on the internet and then somehow the laws of zekrom bound these rules to the internet and gosh forbid if you don't follow them exactly you will be in the eternal prison that is the darkness zone of the infinity zone of the darkness ablaze and you can never play a pokemon game again uh and this happens with nuzzlocks too they're maybe it's just maybe it's just twitch people come in and they're like you're doing another this way do you not know the rules you're supposed to do like guess what it is twitch no maybe about it it's like who cares like and i get that question all the time it's like oh if is it okay if i use held items in my nuzlocke yeah man it's your nose like do whatever you want it's like i found a shiny i found a shoddy in my nuzlocke but i already caught a pokemon in this rock can i catch it yes nope you gotta throw it away what what do you possibly think is gonna happen if you don't like do you think a meteorite is gonna crash through your living room if you decide that yeah oh gosh what if i break the rule here and catch the shiny who cares oh the arguments over the wild area and nuzlockes fill my soul just do whatever it does none of it matters i mean you're not wrong i think it not gonna be good to do that jokingly uh i mean so when we run up to the thing of i think it should be this way why are you not doing it my way like that is just a human condition of they have an expectation that's not being met uh lower your expectations people just get just it's not that big of a deal yeah so normally when i learn from gen x lower your expectations exactly normally when i do nuzlockes i will i will like put a level cap on so i'll be like somebody look up what blaine's level is and somebody'll be like blaine's pony plane's ponyta is like 42. i was like okay cool the level kept 42 then and so i was like i would get questions of like why do you have a level cap well it's like it's to make it harder yeah and then i'll like limit myself for like items and battles because i think that makes it harder too because a lot of times i'll see people be like and that's fine i mean if they want to do it that way that's totally cool but i'll see somebody like battling bruno and bruno uses earthquake and their pokemon has like one hp and then they potion they use a hyper potion and then bruno uses earthquake again and they're back at one hp so they use a hyper potion and then bruno uses earthquake again and they repeat this for 10 times and all of a sudden earth bruno uses bind and they're like oh finally i can i can now attack and it's like well yeah i mean you just used 10 hyper potions to wait until he was out of earthquakes and now now you're in a safe zone um and if that's how you want to play that's totally cool i just don't think that's personally fun i think potion stalling is is is really kind of cheap and so i try to limit myself with three items uh 2021 but i would i would never going to twitch streamers uh you're potion stalling i can't believe you're ruining nuzlocke this way i can't believe that your potion's telling that's not the rules of a nuzlocke you're gonna get banned from another stream but so so i put that rule on so now then so when people see me play they're like oh well should should i put a potion limit on it's like no you should do whatever you think makes it fun for you if you if it if you not using items makes your experience less fun then don't put that rule on yourself if if putting a level cap on your pokemon makes it less fun then don't do that um so whatever works i don't know but the the people who are the nuzlocke police are are are the worst people who are the police of any silly thing are not great well 10 years oh boy i have not been doing pokemon of the week for 10 years i've only been doing it since february 14 2012. which i was going to do a throwback but because i'm sick we're not we're not throwing anything back i'll throw you back to technically last week even though it was a week and a half ago never should have been animated in the overworld it just kind of hops around it even though it is not a bug type it had its naming convention is based on bug uh thingamajiggers and what's the word for it i don't know no like larvae just terminology that we rever refer to bug growth cycles whatever um and it uh uh it can learn dark type moves before it evolves to its final form but it doesn't get stabbed from dark type moves until it's in its final form but when it's in its final form it loses stab from uh ground type moves such as earthquake so what you got for me kids it's pancham it's pupitar poopitar yes larvae pupae and tar tyranny there's no such thing as tyrae but larvae and pupae are um refer to insect growth periods yes it is it is pupitar um i don't know why they bothered to animate it the way that they did in the overworld it is absolutely horrifying it looks so incredibly sad following you around hopping on its one little point with the only expression coming from its eyes which are hidden inside of that shell but i finally evolved it to tyranitar and then i put it away yeah i have a little um uh what's my little firebug dude no you are so bad at pokemon of the week no volcarona sent to scorch what's yeah what's before something so sizzle peed yes i got a little sizzlip follow me around it's real cute pupitar is based on yeah i think we've established that already that's that's the origin in the trivia that's it not a lot going for this pokemon you think anyone that this is their favorite pokemon yes yeah look i'm continually surprised that the amount of people who come out of the woodwork to defend everything but still [ __ ] and catskill no there's no way the people that would the people that would say that this is their favorite pokemon over tyranitar or larvatar both significantly better pokemon they're they're like the the cassette listeners of 2020. they're like they're nesters they're like i'm gonna say pupitar because no one else is gonna say pupitar even though like deep down they know tyranitar and larvitar are both significantly better yeah you can send all your angry emails to sbj at pkmntask.com there you go all you pupitar lovers yep just light it up light up that inbox i can't wait to get exactly zero emails i mean we don't know because you don't ever we never hear from them anymore like we you could be sitting on 50 emails and like episodes episode 500 like i've been sitting on 4 000 emails so we're going to go through these for episode 500. uh we definitely get emails but now is not the time now's not the time we'll give us our for next week this okay so i was going to try harder but i'm i'm just really not feeling well so you get what you get after a 15-year hiatus i have decided to return to one of the hobbies that i have most enjoyed in life playing guitar in the early 2000s i purchased a yamaha folk guitar and took lessons for a year or two i have been quite surprised to discover that even after all of these years have passed i am still able to read sheet music and play notes quite well when i first started studying guitar i studied classical style which is not impossible but is also not simple to do on a folk guitar partially because of this i do not read tablature and never learned any of today's pop hits i still enjoy playing classical guitar as i find finger picking to be quite rewarding you may or may not be aware but in the unova games there are musicians scattered throughout the region if you interact with them their instrument may become part of the game's soundtrack in black and white 2 there is a small puzzle to unlock the piano track in a cumulator in the northeast corner of the town a pianist and a drummer are together in a house they request to view two pokemon one being wismer this week's pokemon is the other one they wish to see unfortunately you cannot obtain the pokemon they ask for in black and white 2. you can obtain its evolution in black and white if you hunt diligently in the dream yard but then you will have to breed it to obtain the smaller small tater that they are looking for all right that's all your clues that's your pokemon of the week 10th anniversary that's
