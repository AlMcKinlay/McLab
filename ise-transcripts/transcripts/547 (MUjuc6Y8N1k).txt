recovery week (0:38 - 0:43)
here in lovely Minnesota nobody's going (0:40 - 0:44)
anywhere nobody should go anywhere but (0:43 - 0:48)
yet we made it to a mall yesterday (0:44 - 0:50)
we did it wasn't too busy actually no (0:48 - 0:53)
I'm not surprised it wasn't too busy (0:50 - 0:56)
Hannah also here hello I am here as well (0:53 - 0:59)
it's been rainy here but nothing like (0:56 - 1:02)
you all have had just constant rain and (0:59 - 1:07)
not super cold but cold for here (1:02 - 1:07)
20 degrees (1:12 - 1:15)
thank you (1:14 - 1:18)
yeah 30s and 40s here just constant rain (1:15 - 1:22)
which was fun for Community Day (1:18 - 1:24)
uh well speaking of community day uh (1:22 - 1:25)
that's what we're going to start off (1:24 - 1:27)
with we got some Pokemon Go News uh we (1:25 - 1:29)
got some VGC news we got some squish (1:27 - 1:32)
Mellows Mallows I don't know squish (1:29 - 1:33)
squish news (1:32 - 1:36)
um and then some squishy squish (1:33 - 1:38)
some squishy squish stuff uh and the (1:36 - 1:41)
Pokemon Masters ex not really a lot (1:38 - 1:43)
going on in scarlet and violet although (1:41 - 1:45)
Joe serebi thinks they're gonna start (1:43 - 1:49)
talking about uh goldango golden go you (1:45 - 1:51)
know I I was hoping that the (1:49 - 1:52)
commentators would all be on the same (1:51 - 1:55)
page this weekend at uh uh San Diego (1:52 - 1:58)
because I've been told by the (1:55 - 2:00)
commentating staff that the people (1:58 - 2:02)
behind you know because they wear the (2:00 - 2:05)
headsets and like they're told to say (2:02 - 2:07)
Pokemon a certain way just like the (2:05 - 2:09)
voice actors are in the anime (2:07 - 2:11)
uh (2:09 - 2:12)
I guess they didn't get the memo yet (2:11 - 2:15)
because they haven't decided the anime (2:12 - 2:17)
hasn't happened yet yeah no no one knows (2:15 - 2:19)
how to say any of these uh Pokemon's (2:17 - 2:21)
names so we're still on the fence on (2:19 - 2:23)
that anyways (2:21 - 2:23)
um (2:23 - 2:25)
let's start off with the Pokemon Go News (2:23 - 2:28)
uh Community Day came and went it was (2:25 - 2:31)
Chespin which I think most people would (2:28 - 2:33)
argue is a good Pokemon because it's a (2:31 - 2:35)
new Pokemon and it's a starter so it (2:33 - 2:38)
hits those two check boxes a brand new (2:35 - 2:39)
shiny (2:38 - 2:42)
2023 strong (2:39 - 2:44)
ly (2:42 - 2:47)
I would assume that uh they're gonna (2:44 - 2:50)
probably well okay so Fennekin would be (2:47 - 2:51)
next I don't know if it would be in like (2:50 - 2:55)
two months next but my assumption is (2:51 - 2:57)
they would say Froakie for the summer (2:55 - 2:59)
since we already know that summer is the (2:57 - 3:03)
busiest season for PoGo (2:59 - 3:06)
because next month is go whatever Hoenn (3:03 - 3:10)
Super Fest right yeah (3:06 - 3:13)
[Laughter] (3:10 - 3:16)
it's uh yes the hoens well um so when (3:13 - 3:18)
they did like the other starters it was (3:16 - 3:20)
like every other month so it used to be (3:18 - 3:22)
it used to be right and then they they (3:20 - 3:24)
just stopped doing starters which makes (3:22 - 3:27)
sense because they had to slow down (3:24 - 3:30)
they're running out of Pokemon (3:27 - 3:31)
um (3:30 - 3:35)
yeah so I I maybe March is Fennekin and (3:31 - 3:38)
that would be April May for Froakie see (3:35 - 3:40)
I think that's too early (3:38 - 3:42)
I think that's too early because that (3:40 - 3:45)
again I think because of how popular (3:42 - 3:48)
Greninja is they'll want to save that (3:45 - 3:51)
for a Summer Event have it solidly in (3:48 - 3:55)
summer July August I mean having once (3:51 - 3:58)
been called out recently by a certain (3:55 - 4:01)
Australian member of our slack it is (3:58 - 4:03)
only summer (4:01 - 4:04)
up here (4:03 - 4:07)
and it is winter (4:04 - 4:10)
down under but it is also summer for (4:07 - 4:13)
Japan we all know which hemisphere they (4:10 - 4:14)
prefer (4:13 - 4:17)
that is never Australia it's never I (4:14 - 4:19)
think just be used to it I think it's (4:17 - 4:22)
safe to say that the United States Japan (4:19 - 4:23)
and Germany are their three biggest (4:22 - 4:25)
markets (4:23 - 4:29)
I've heard from sources that Germany is (4:25 - 4:32)
one of the biggest markets I I I can't (4:29 - 4:34)
report who those sources are but I was (4:32 - 4:36)
at Germany did Germany did all the (4:34 - 4:38)
Germans (4:36 - 4:38)
well I was buying a pretzel in Germany (4:39 - 4:43)
the pretzel guy was like you know (4:41 - 4:45)
Pokemon go let's talk about Japan and I (4:43 - 4:46)
was like this is some first hand (4:45 - 4:49)
reporting uh look there's no secret that (4:46 - 4:52)
Germany has its own there's three go (4:49 - 4:54)
fests in the world you just happened to (4:52 - 4:55)
line up with those three countries I (4:54 - 4:58)
just listed (4:55 - 4:58)
um (4:59 - 5:02)
so yeah those all happen to be in the (5:00 - 5:04)
north those all also have happened to be (5:02 - 5:06)
in the northern hemisphere (5:04 - 5:09)
uh I think I think they're saving (5:06 - 5:11)
Froakie for summer (5:09 - 5:13)
to take to double dip I think that's a (5:11 - 5:15)
good idea you 'll be giving them that (5:13 - 5:18)
idea yeah (5:15 - 5:18)
yeah I'm scribbling down so (5:21 - 5:28)
I okay so is that a July Pokemon do you (5:24 - 5:29)
feel (5:28 - 5:31)
oh yeah yeah yeah (5:29 - 5:34)
okay so then what's a May Pokemon that'd (5:31 - 5:35)
be fun again right (5:34 - 5:38)
June July (5:35 - 5:38)
it's a three-month in-betweens of two (5:42 - 5:46)
months of every other one oh so you're (5:44 - 5:47)
saying they're gonna go not every month (5:46 - 5:50)
throwing every three months yeah okay so (5:47 - 5:53)
then what's so we got Hoenn super fun (5:50 - 5:58)
Vegas Bonanza February what (5:53 - 6:01)
janky filler are they doing for Merc (5:58 - 6:04)
why does it have to be janky it could (6:01 - 6:06)
just be a filler okay (6:04 - 6:09)
Jakey filler while I know I know some (6:06 - 6:11)
people like I know I'm in the night to (6:09 - 6:14)
create a group uh I don't I don't know (6:11 - 6:16)
what's coming next I did not even know (6:14 - 6:18)
like when when larvae Larvitar got (6:16 - 6:21)
announced for which is news Larvitar is (6:18 - 6:25)
the classic Community Day uh when (6:21 - 6:27)
Larvitar got announced I found out kind (6:25 - 6:29)
of the same time you guys all found out (6:27 - 6:30)
I think I might have found out like the (6:29 - 6:34)
night before and I was like oh that's (6:30 - 6:36)
look I'm sure people are excited about a (6:34 - 6:37)
lot of like try and turns very (6:36 - 6:40)
good right attacker I just I went very (6:37 - 6:41)
hard on that Community Day (6:40 - 6:45)
yeah that was an intense one for me and (6:41 - 6:48)
I've like you also told me the wrong (6:45 - 6:51)
date what did I say you were like it's (6:48 - 6:54)
the weekend uh is like in two weeks is (6:51 - 6:59)
it next week no it's the 21st (6:54 - 7:01)
yeah it's like but you're like oh I (6:59 - 7:02)
think it's like around the 15th I'm like (7:01 - 7:04)
that doesn't sound at all right (7:02 - 7:08)
this is 21st yeah it is (7:04 - 7:11)
okay my guess is for next month because (7:08 - 7:14)
it's going to be the Hoenn super would (7:11 - 7:16)
you call it the Superfest the whole and (7:14 - 7:18)
Super Fun Fest happy you're gonna do (7:16 - 7:21)
they're gonna do a gen 3 Pokemon that's (7:18 - 7:23)
going to be shiny anyways and then the (7:21 - 7:25)
the internet's gonna get mad because (7:23 - 7:29)
like it's gonna be Spinda (7:25 - 7:30)
well I'm I'm looking at the Gen 3 (7:29 - 7:32)
Pokemon (7:30 - 7:35)
um I know Gulpin cannot be shiny right (7:32 - 7:39)
so that that's going to be new for Helen (7:35 - 7:41)
um (7:39 - 7:41)
as many of the shinies are out as (7:42 - 7:48)
possible before the tour happens so that (7:45 - 7:50)
the tour is less exciting (7:48 - 7:53)
Cacnea cannot be shiny yet (7:50 - 7:56)
can Casper be shiny cast form can be (7:53 - 7:59)
shiny yes they selectively (7:56 - 8:01)
maybe all of them (7:59 - 8:03)
so at first it was at first it was only (8:01 - 8:04)
a couple of the forms I don't know if (8:03 - 8:06)
all of them are at this I don't think (8:04 - 8:07)
all of them I don't think snowy can be (8:06 - 8:09)
shiny I think it's just raining no snowy (8:07 - 8:12)
definitely can so then the sun is the (8:09 - 8:15)
non-shiny one that sounds right because (8:12 - 8:18)
I know rainy was changed for last year (8:15 - 8:21)
I'm I (8:18 - 8:24)
looking at this list (8:21 - 8:24)
what a guy Gulpin and Cacnea both cannot (8:25 - 8:31)
be shiny (8:29 - 8:34)
uh (8:31 - 8:34)
yeah I didn't just be shiny yes (8:34 - 8:39)
barboach oh yeah (8:39 - 8:49)
ball toy yes the leap yes anareth yeah (8:42 - 8:52)
yeah yeah and Earth is the strawberry (8:49 - 8:56)
shiny did they they have they did (8:52 - 8:59)
Tropius Trophy this is definitely being (8:56 - 9:01)
released shiny for the tour yeah yeah (8:59 - 9:05)
well turkeys Africa (9:01 - 9:05)
they could do (9:05 - 9:10)
they did glarion Zigzagoon they never (9:08 - 9:12)
did a regular zigzaging community (9:10 - 9:15)
true but that's already shiny and has (9:12 - 9:16)
been forever (9:15 - 9:18)
that's never stopped him before man it's (9:16 - 9:20)
that they ever correct that has not (9:18 - 9:22)
stopped him before so (9:20 - 9:26)
this is what I think they do Wurmple (9:22 - 9:29)
they had they had great success with uh (9:26 - 9:30)
Weedle (9:29 - 9:34)
they do Wurmple (9:30 - 9:34)
when all of their shiny wormple evolve (9:34 - 9:40)
into one single yeah and not the other (9:37 - 9:42)
one I don't think yeah I don't think (9:40 - 9:45)
whirlpool's a bad pick no it's a good (9:42 - 9:48)
Pokemon because you get five shinies out (9:45 - 9:50)
of that ideally right technically (9:48 - 9:52)
there's five shinies there not three (9:50 - 9:54)
because you get cascoon silicon (9:52 - 9:57)
beautified dust talks (9:54 - 9:59)
and then they don't have to worry about (9:57 - 10:02)
a new one but let's just have it be (9:59 - 10:04)
relicanth Community today it's just a (10:02 - 10:07)
single Relic Camp yeah look New Zealand (10:04 - 10:11)
has very little going on for them can't (10:07 - 10:14)
they have hobbies don't even (10:11 - 10:19)
so are we assuming for super happy hohen (10:14 - 10:20)
great day (10:19 - 10:25)
and is this how we're getting Jirachi (10:20 - 10:25)
yeah (10:25 - 10:29)
because they've put out the access (10:27 - 10:31)
already right like that's been in raids (10:29 - 10:33)
forever oh yeah yeah (10:31 - 10:35)
they milked the access because it's good (10:33 - 10:36)
for gbl2 (10:35 - 10:38)
well one of them (10:36 - 10:43)
yeah the bloody one is (10:38 - 10:43)
yeah yeah this is how we get Jirachi (10:43 - 10:48)
this is how we get Primal Groudon so we (10:46 - 10:50)
get Primal Kyogre (10:48 - 10:52)
I I know some people are like when you (10:50 - 10:54)
go to the Fest (10:52 - 10:56)
Hannah you're not going right (10:54 - 10:57)
I don't think so I don't think I'm gonna (10:56 - 11:00)
be able to I really really want to go to (10:57 - 11:01)
one I've still never been to an (11:00 - 11:04)
in-person go event (11:01 - 11:07)
but not this one I think (11:04 - 11:08)
um (11:07 - 11:10)
I was asked by people like let me remote (11:08 - 11:12)
into Primal Groudon and Kyogre when (11:10 - 11:14)
you're going (11:12 - 11:15)
to think niantic's gonna let people (11:14 - 11:17)
remote into these yeah like that one's (11:15 - 11:19)
gonna happen almost definitely not no (11:17 - 11:20)
yeah (11:19 - 11:22)
I mean I'm bummed that I will be on a (11:20 - 11:25)
super fun vacation and having to miss (11:22 - 11:29)
the garbage town that is Vegas (11:25 - 11:31)
uh wait have you been to Vegas oh I hate (11:29 - 11:33)
Vegas with a screaming pet I hate that (11:31 - 11:35)
City so much yes I've been to Vegas (11:33 - 11:37)
multiple times do you think it's worse (11:35 - 11:41)
than St Louis yes way worse than St (11:37 - 11:43)
Louis (11:41 - 11:43)
um (11:45 - 11:47)
yeah yeah this is for sure the way to (11:46 - 11:51)
get to Rocky obviously and then um you (11:47 - 11:53)
know they'll make like (11:51 - 11:55)
they they did (11:53 - 11:57)
Mew and Celebi for everyone else right (11:55 - 11:58)
like that was eventually free for (11:57 - 12:00)
everyone else you Celebi I mean they (11:58 - 12:02)
gave everyone a shiny Celebi for (12:00 - 12:04)
Christmas like two years ago (12:02 - 12:07)
yeah how did what did they do how did we (12:04 - 12:08)
get (12:07 - 12:10)
the free we got them because we went to (12:08 - 12:12)
the go Fest Greg (12:10 - 12:14)
but what I know they gave a thing after (12:12 - 12:16)
was that (12:14 - 12:19)
anyone yeah was that shiny Celebi was (12:16 - 12:21)
for the movie (12:19 - 12:22)
it was for the secrets of the Jungle (12:21 - 12:23)
movie (12:22 - 12:25)
but that was just a quest line right (12:23 - 12:27)
yeah okay yeah that was just like a free (12:25 - 12:30)
quest line with Team Rocket (12:27 - 12:31)
that was like one of the more generous (12:30 - 12:38)
[Laughter] (12:31 - 12:38)
generous uh I think I haven't seen (12:38 - 12:43)
anyone complain about this upcoming (12:41 - 12:45)
event it looks really great I actually (12:43 - 12:47)
might take a whole a whole day off just (12:45 - 12:49)
to grind this event because it is (12:47 - 12:51)
actually genuinely good (12:49 - 12:53)
um this is the live your own Whimsical (12:51 - 12:56)
Adventure in the twinkling fantasy event (12:53 - 12:58)
also somebody pointed out that the (12:56 - 13:01)
mythical wish logo looks like a Disney (12:58 - 13:03)
Channel logo and I can't for sure see it (13:01 - 13:08)
100 oh yeah it's insane it is well so (13:03 - 13:11)
it's got a very Barbie slash Tinkerbell (13:08 - 13:15)
feel to it yeah like it's got that like (13:11 - 13:20)
early 2000s clearly we're making this (13:15 - 13:22)
for girls logo (13:20 - 13:26)
design choices that all the gay boys (13:22 - 13:29)
love and we're like yes give me that a (13:26 - 13:33)
thousand times that more of that (13:29 - 13:33)
I don't like it but I I see I see the I (13:34 - 13:41)
see the Disney in it (13:38 - 13:42)
okay you can surround yourself in a (13:41 - 13:45)
circle of fairy type Dedenne and battle (13:42 - 13:47)
with dragon Pokemon Mega salamance (13:45 - 13:48)
during the upcoming twinkling fantasy (13:47 - 13:50)
event (13:48 - 13:52)
uh Mega salamance will make its debut in (13:50 - 13:55)
raids which salamance is an incredibly (13:52 - 13:58)
popular Pokemon uh Mega salamance you (13:55 - 14:01)
know I feel like people some people love (13:58 - 14:02)
Bank of Sailor Man some people don't (14:01 - 14:05)
it's it's it's definitely a look (14:02 - 14:08)
I think it's cooler now that we have the (14:05 - 14:10)
ancient one from scarlet and violet oh (14:08 - 14:14)
Rory yeah uh it's you know it's the Star (14:10 - 14:16)
Wars Rebel logo so (14:14 - 14:18)
I have always loved this (14:16 - 14:21)
got it uh you can get twice the XP for (14:18 - 14:23)
successfully catching Pokemon with nice (14:21 - 14:24)
great and excellent throws this is (14:23 - 14:27)
really great it's usually (14:24 - 14:28)
um (14:27 - 14:30)
you know they excellent throws does give (14:28 - 14:31)
you a lot of experience compared to the (14:30 - 14:33)
other two but getting double just for (14:31 - 14:36)
doing that is great (14:33 - 14:38)
um you will get additional candy for (14:36 - 14:41)
nice great and excellent throws and (14:38 - 14:43)
trainers who are level 31 and above will (14:41 - 14:46)
receive Excel candy for successful nice (14:43 - 14:49)
great and excellent throws we'll see how (14:46 - 14:53)
uh see if that bonus actually works (14:49 - 14:56)
you'll receive Excel candy it's like are (14:53 - 14:58)
we (14:56 - 14:58)
for the bug catcher event I'm pretty (14:59 - 15:03)
sure these were the same bonuses for the (15:01 - 15:05)
bug catcher event last summer and (15:03 - 15:07)
everybody loved that event who played it (15:05 - 15:09)
I don't remember that one I remember I (15:07 - 15:12)
bought okay hold on I think Niantic gave (15:09 - 15:16)
me a free ticket to the Hoenn mega (15:12 - 15:17)
starters although I was planning on (15:16 - 15:19)
buying it because I was gonna go to Mall (15:17 - 15:21)
of America anyways (15:19 - 15:24)
um and I didn't feel like I was getting (15:21 - 15:27)
the like XL bonus candy yeah that one (15:24 - 15:31)
was the best but yes that that mega (15:27 - 15:33)
event was good except for the XL candy (15:31 - 15:37)
not happening I got three shiny Blaziken (15:33 - 15:38)
from that event that I didn't really (15:37 - 15:40)
need but enjoyed but I don't think (15:38 - 15:44)
anybody saw the XL candy increase (15:40 - 15:47)
yeah which uh again that was a paid (15:44 - 15:49)
event this is you don't have to pay any (15:47 - 15:52)
money to get Excel candy for nice great (15:49 - 15:56)
or excellent throws so we'll see (15:52 - 15:58)
if that's a thing (15:56 - 16:00)
um the wild Pokemon that we'll encounter (15:58 - 16:03)
here are going to be Clefairy clefable (16:00 - 16:06)
Jigglypuff Dratini boy gen one strikes (16:03 - 16:10)
again uh Togetic Merrell raltz the Brava (16:06 - 16:14)
Bagon Dino and Dedenne if you're lucky (16:10 - 16:16)
trainers a Shiny Dedenne will make its (16:14 - 16:17)
debut and if you're really lucky (16:16 - 16:20)
trainers Goomy and Noibat will spawn in (16:17 - 16:22)
the wild (16:20 - 16:23)
um it's easier to say which Pokemon (16:22 - 16:26)
cannot be shiny the Brava and Gumi (16:23 - 16:29)
cannot be shiny nor is the clefable (16:26 - 16:32)
marked why do they do this oh sorry else (16:29 - 16:37)
yes correct the one before it is (16:32 - 16:38)
just (16:37 - 16:42)
so Jay's form Pokemon and babies can be (16:38 - 16:44)
shiny once they're shiny evolved Pokemon (16:42 - 16:47)
cannot be shiny unless they are a (16:44 - 16:49)
Pokemon that has a mega that has been (16:47 - 16:51)
released at that point that evolved (16:49 - 16:54)
Pokemon can be shiny that is the general (16:51 - 16:58)
rule going back to Community Day (16:54 - 17:01)
we I I only did two of the three hours (16:58 - 17:03)
because I had to take my cat to an (17:01 - 17:04)
appointment (17:03 - 17:06)
um but throughout that whole two hours (17:04 - 17:09)
the only raids that spawned and we were (17:06 - 17:11)
at mall America there's a lot of gyms (17:09 - 17:13)
we're a Neato King and a Neato Queen (17:11 - 17:15)
there was (17:13 - 17:18)
cannot be shiny (17:15 - 17:20)
there was an alolan Marowak when I first (17:18 - 17:24)
arrived at right at two that was the (17:20 - 17:26)
only that was the only thing I saw but (17:24 - 17:32)
like who in 2023 is being like where's (17:26 - 17:34)
my wallet I gotta get into this Neato (17:32 - 17:37)
King right right now like who is doing (17:34 - 17:40)
his rights nobody (17:37 - 17:44)
somebody has to be somebody wants to use (17:40 - 17:46)
their free pass yeah there's a lot of (17:44 - 17:48)
free passage that day totally like like (17:46 - 17:50)
if I was leaving the Mall of America and (17:48 - 17:51)
I knew I wasn't going to do any other (17:50 - 17:53)
raid I would jump into anything just to (17:51 - 17:56)
use my free pass but like (17:53 - 17:57)
at the start of community day I'm not (17:56 - 17:59)
gonna waste my free pass on a Neato (17:57 - 18:01)
queen I'm gonna be like ah hopefully (17:59 - 18:03)
Reshiram spawns within the next like 45 (18:01 - 18:07)
minutes here and it didn't and the the (18:03 - 18:09)
thing is like (18:07 - 18:11)
I think maybe Nidoqueen is good in GBL (18:09 - 18:14)
but I think it's like the purified one (18:11 - 18:16)
um or the shadow one I don't think it's (18:14 - 18:17)
just a regular one (18:16 - 18:19)
but it's like (18:17 - 18:22)
a genuine that's I'm I am being genuine (18:19 - 18:25)
like who is doing these raids like you (18:22 - 18:26)
could maybe say you're doing the raid (18:25 - 18:28)
for like this chance of shiny but they (18:26 - 18:29)
can't even be shiny they're not good for (18:28 - 18:31)
GBL they can't be shiny they've been (18:29 - 18:33)
around for six years (18:31 - 18:36)
[Laughter] (18:33 - 18:40)
like how have you not gotten one yet (18:36 - 18:45)
yeah I I would I would love to see like (18:40 - 18:47)
the statistics (18:45 - 18:50)
um who's still joining Marowak raids who (18:47 - 18:54)
still join in rock referee I like I mean (18:50 - 18:57)
I will say this when I got there if the (18:54 - 19:00)
alolan Marowak raid had more than 45 (18:57 - 19:02)
seconds left and when I checked there (19:00 - 19:06)
was actually a lobby with people in it I (19:02 - 19:07)
probably would have jumped into it yeah (19:06 - 19:10)
alolan Marowak can be shiny and it's not (19:07 - 19:12)
available in any way other than raids (19:10 - 19:14)
unless there's some special event going (19:12 - 19:16)
on so that's actually a worthwhile rate (19:14 - 19:20)
especially for new people but Nidoqueen (19:16 - 19:20)
I mean even if you're new even if you're (19:21 - 19:25)
trying to complete your Pokedex if you (19:24 - 19:27)
catch Neato Queen you still need the (19:25 - 19:30)
other two (19:27 - 19:30)
Mega Nido Queen Mega needto King and (19:32 - 19:37)
we're (19:35 - 19:37)
uh okay so those are the Pokemon like (19:39 - 19:43)
pee in the the wild uh this is also (19:41 - 19:45)
really good for people who want to try (19:43 - 19:46)
to complete their fairy and their dragon (19:45 - 19:49)
medals because those I I think fairy and (19:46 - 19:51)
dragon dragon for sure but fairy and (19:49 - 19:53)
dragon are some of the more rare spawns (19:51 - 19:56)
oh yeah those are two of the three I (19:53 - 19:58)
need left to complete got to platinum (19:56 - 20:01)
there will be a new collection challenge (19:58 - 20:04)
uh where it doesn't say what you need to (20:01 - 20:06)
collect but if you do finish it you will (20:04 - 20:09)
get 50 salamance Mega Mega Energy a (20:06 - 20:11)
charge tmfstm (20:09 - 20:13)
field research will give you Clefairy (20:11 - 20:16)
Dratini Bagon Dedenne maybe Gumi one (20:13 - 20:18)
star raids will have Jigglypuff Merrell (20:16 - 20:21)
axu and Dino (20:18 - 20:22)
three star raids will have Mall wild (20:21 - 20:24)
again Dedenne (20:22 - 20:26)
so dread against coming back (20:24 - 20:29)
not that he's constantly missing but he (20:26 - 20:31)
he was gone for a little bit (20:29 - 20:34)
five star rays will give you Zekrom (20:31 - 20:36)
um and then uh your mega raids will be (20:34 - 20:40)
mega Salamence and I had them we had a (20:36 - 20:42)
Bagon Community Day didn't we (20:40 - 20:45)
yes okay a while ago (20:42 - 20:48)
so somewhere in there I have a shiny (20:45 - 20:51)
that I just need to make a candy for (20:48 - 20:51)
yes (20:52 - 20:55)
um (20:54 - 20:58)
and then I think did we have actually a (20:55 - 21:00)
community yet or is that this year (20:58 - 21:02)
that's supposedly this year (21:00 - 21:04)
yeah I remember an accident Community (21:02 - 21:08)
but I don't pay attention so (21:04 - 21:11)
I can't remember which uh (21:08 - 21:13)
uh this this is also I'm sure going to (21:11 - 21:15)
be a minor complaint that happens on (21:13 - 21:17)
Tuesday so the twinkling fantasy event (21:15 - 21:20)
starts at 8 A.M Tuesday January 10th but (21:17 - 21:23)
Zekrom is not going to appear in raids (21:20 - 21:25)
and until 10 a.m so there will be a two (21:23 - 21:27)
hour gap (21:25 - 21:29)
uh and I am sure (21:27 - 21:33)
somebody's gonna complain that like the (21:29 - 21:35)
event started but we still have Reshiram (21:33 - 21:37)
which isn't even a bad Pokemon like (21:35 - 21:38)
restaurant is like right (21:37 - 21:41)
here I'm so better shiny (21:38 - 21:42)
um so (21:41 - 21:45)
just a heads up the the Zekrom starts at (21:42 - 21:48)
10 and then the uh the actual event (21:45 - 21:50)
starts at eight and and then this event (21:48 - 21:52)
is about a week long if I'm not mistaken (21:50 - 21:56)
uh that goes until (21:52 - 21:56)
Tuesday January 10th until Monday (21:56 - 22:01)
January 16th (21:59 - 22:03)
um so yeah pretty much a week for this (22:01 - 22:04)
event (22:03 - 22:07)
it's a good event yeah I would say that (22:04 - 22:11)
the only thing that's kind of lacking (22:07 - 22:11)
pose as the reward for the collection (22:11 - 22:15)
challenge like the bug catcher one did (22:13 - 22:17)
because that was really nice that was (22:15 - 22:19)
kind of a huge incentive when you finish (22:17 - 22:20)
the collection challenge you could put (22:19 - 22:22)
on that pose and show your friends that (22:20 - 22:25)
you finished it but other than that this (22:22 - 22:26)
is a good event it has good Pokemon (22:25 - 22:28)
spawning and it's a great time to get (22:26 - 22:32)
those medals to platinum (22:28 - 22:32)
uh speaking of getting a metal to (22:32 - 22:36)
platinum a lot of people for several (22:34 - 22:39)
years needed one more Pokemon to get (22:36 - 22:41)
their Hoenn metal to platinum uh and (22:39 - 22:44)
that Pokemon is now here (22:41 - 22:48)
made its debut in Pokemon go the color (22:44 - 22:51)
swap Pokemon is here (22:48 - 22:53)
um (22:51 - 22:56)
trainers who attend Pokemon go ho and (22:53 - 22:58)
tour will be able to get shiny kekland (22:56 - 22:59)
for the first time if they're lucky (22:58 - 23:01)
uh (22:59 - 23:03)
uh I think they did this in a cool way (23:01 - 23:06)
uh uh Hannah do you want to explain how (23:03 - 23:10)
I want to add one small note also (23:06 - 23:12)
shiny kecleon will also be available (23:10 - 23:14)
globally during the global Hoenn tour (23:12 - 23:17)
after the Las Vegas one so it is not (23:14 - 23:20)
exclusive to Vegas only I just wanted to (23:17 - 23:21)
make that (23:20 - 23:23)
known (23:21 - 23:25)
um but yeah they did this well (23:23 - 23:29)
um it didn't break well well I I I (23:25 - 23:32)
disagree because I never saw this I (23:29 - 23:33)
never saw it (23:32 - 23:36)
never saw a single thing I haven't (23:33 - 23:39)
actually caught one either (23:36 - 23:41)
um I went looking after Community day (23:39 - 23:43)
yesterday and just haven't run into one (23:41 - 23:44)
have been checking this morning haven't (23:43 - 23:46)
seen any (23:44 - 23:48)
um but they've been doing these Pokemon (23:46 - 23:51)
they did they finally introduced Zorua (23:48 - 23:53)
they finally brought in Vivion and now (23:51 - 23:55)
they've finally got keckley on and (23:53 - 23:57)
they're kind of somewhat rapidly (23:55 - 23:59)
introducing these Pokemon that have been (23:57 - 24:02)
missing for a while and I'm kind of (23:59 - 24:04)
wondering if there's a reason why but (24:02 - 24:06)
this one seems to have gone off (24:04 - 24:09)
the most well Vivion was pretty well (24:06 - 24:11)
accepted but this one went off really (24:09 - 24:13)
smoothly there was one bug though (24:11 - 24:16)
because apparently the ability to see (24:13 - 24:18)
kecleon at a pokestop that is far away (24:16 - 24:21)
outside your spin distance is considered (24:18 - 24:23)
a bug which is unfortunate because (24:21 - 24:25)
that's helpful oh right yes (24:23 - 24:27)
yeah (24:25 - 24:28)
um (24:27 - 24:31)
as long as they keep kecleon in (24:28 - 24:33)
I think that that's great and I think (24:31 - 24:35)
that its spawn rate (24:33 - 24:37)
I'm not deep in the data mines but I (24:35 - 24:39)
think that its spawn rate is more (24:37 - 24:42)
related to Rocket pokestops than it is (24:39 - 24:45)
related to season or location or any (24:42 - 24:47)
other event spawn rate so I think that (24:45 - 24:50)
it might stick around for a while and as (24:47 - 24:52)
long as they keep it around this is a (24:50 - 24:54)
good mechanic this is a good way to get (24:52 - 24:55)
this Pokemon in here and it's an (24:54 - 24:58)
exciting thing to run into (24:55 - 24:58)
yeah I (24:59 - 25:05)
uh like like any event that requires a (25:02 - 25:07)
lot of pokestops uh this the city (25:05 - 25:10)
players benefit the most here that's (25:07 - 25:14)
true that is true uh I I usually stay (25:10 - 25:16)
around Mall of America (25:14 - 25:18)
for (25:16 - 25:20)
um a bit after the event uh mostly (25:18 - 25:22)
because you know people there are gonna (25:20 - 25:24)
do the (25:22 - 25:28)
middle Evolution raids and some more you (25:24 - 25:29)
know you get 30 minutes or whatever (25:28 - 25:33)
extra of what the community Pokemon was (25:29 - 25:34)
um (25:33 - 25:37)
but I had to leave pretty promptly to (25:34 - 25:40)
pick my cat up um so I only did one lap (25:37 - 25:42)
around uh Moa (25:40 - 25:45)
which has what like 50 60 pokestops or (25:42 - 25:48)
something crazy like that uh no (25:45 - 25:49)
calculate (25:48 - 25:51)
but I was like (25:49 - 25:53)
unless they're gonna remove it within 48 (25:51 - 25:56)
hours I'll be back at MOA for an evening (25:53 - 25:58)
and I'll probably eventually find it (25:56 - 26:00)
right like (25:58 - 26:03)
I think I I saw I saw some people saying (26:00 - 26:05)
like ah it took me like 20 30 minutes I (26:03 - 26:07)
live in a big city but like that seemed (26:05 - 26:09)
to be the consensus of like 20 30 (26:07 - 26:11)
minutes and eventually I found it but (26:09 - 26:13)
also I'm surrounded by hundreds of (26:11 - 26:15)
pokestops again (26:13 - 26:18)
benefiting people in big cities just (26:15 - 26:20)
because that's (26:18 - 26:23)
how the game is if there was any way to (26:20 - 26:25)
make it so it spawned more in places (26:23 - 26:27)
with fewer pokestops that would be (26:25 - 26:29)
helpful but I don't think (26:27 - 26:31)
they're doing that (26:29 - 26:32)
I don't know yeah and I think to your (26:31 - 26:33)
point Hannah as long as they don't (26:32 - 26:35)
remove it if somebody in a small town (26:33 - 26:38)
eventually goes to a big city they they (26:35 - 26:39)
have something to look forward to right (26:38 - 26:41)
like it would it would suck if they were (26:39 - 26:43)
like well it's it's gone now and it's (26:41 - 26:45)
like well I was planning on going to (26:43 - 26:48)
Chicago in a week and that's when I was (26:45 - 26:50)
gonna get it but now it's gone so I know (26:48 - 26:51)
at least one person who's gone running (26:50 - 26:54)
for one and that's that's what I like (26:51 - 26:56)
about it being able to be seen from far (26:54 - 27:00)
away uh that it has that little bit of (26:56 - 27:01)
excitement that makes you go running for (27:00 - 27:03)
a Pokemon that you don't usually get (27:01 - 27:05)
anymore that you used to get at the (27:03 - 27:06)
beginning of this game but once they (27:05 - 27:09)
fixed that bug that's gone (27:06 - 27:13)
boo now we have nothing (27:09 - 27:15)
I mean this there the the this is the (27:13 - 27:17)
thing for like smeargle for the longest (27:15 - 27:18)
times once Marigold gonna come one smear (27:17 - 27:20)
they're gonna come and it's Miracle came (27:18 - 27:21)
and everyone kind of went silent and (27:20 - 27:23)
then we all moved on to like keckleyan (27:21 - 27:25)
of like when's now I don't what is the (27:23 - 27:28)
Pokemon we're missing what is the what (27:25 - 27:29)
is the thing that people are gonna be (27:28 - 27:32)
like where is this Pokemon (27:29 - 27:33)
I'm trying to think of other weird (27:32 - 27:36)
gimmick Pokemon yeah I know what some (27:33 - 27:38)
people have mentioned Larvesta but (27:36 - 27:40)
that's not really a gimmick Pokemon yeah (27:38 - 27:42)
it's just probably gonna be a Pokemon (27:40 - 27:44)
that needs 400 candy when it shows up (27:42 - 27:46)
right like that oh yeah probably what (27:44 - 27:48)
they're gonna do with it yeah (27:46 - 27:51)
they're gonna be like Larvesta is here (27:48 - 27:55)
maybe it's their first 800 candy (27:51 - 27:55)
yeah I (27:56 - 27:59)
but you could maybe say manaphy and (27:57 - 28:02)
fionae but like we we know at this point (27:59 - 28:04)
they're gonna save it for next year (28:02 - 28:06)
like like that is like kind of (28:04 - 28:07)
guaranteed at this point that that's (28:06 - 28:10)
next to your sent out to her (28:07 - 28:12)
like there's no way that manaphy and (28:10 - 28:13)
Fiona isn't going to be something where (28:12 - 28:15)
it takes up one of your egg spots you (28:13 - 28:17)
get a special incubator for it and you (28:15 - 28:19)
have to walk like 50 miles to like hatch (28:17 - 28:21)
it or whatever (28:19 - 28:23)
oh yeah yeah like that that that's like (28:21 - 28:26)
the easiest the niantic's taking a lot (28:23 - 28:27)
of notes this episode they're like all (28:26 - 28:29)
right put Froakie in the summer all (28:27 - 28:31)
right like really big incubator for (28:29 - 28:34)
manaphy got it okay (28:31 - 28:34)
um yeah I don't know what the next like (28:35 - 28:39)
I'm just trying to think of what (28:37 - 28:42)
gimmicks exist like (28:39 - 28:44)
the fact that Zorua came out before (28:42 - 28:48)
kekland was also pretty funny (28:44 - 28:51)
and Vivion came out out before Keck Leon (28:48 - 28:54)
but they finally on in there not that (28:51 - 28:55)
popular (28:54 - 28:58)
not you gotta say is it was a running (28:55 - 29:01)
joke and go yeah for a while but I mean (28:58 - 29:03)
I think that's made it more popular they (29:01 - 29:05)
could have held off until the the month (29:03 - 29:08)
that it was closing like Pokemon go is (29:05 - 29:10)
shutting down in two months guess who's (29:08 - 29:12)
finally here Keck Leon I mean they could (29:10 - 29:16)
have kept that going for years (29:12 - 29:16)
yeah (29:16 - 29:19)
I mean it makes sense for them to do it (29:18 - 29:22)
now because it because they have you (29:19 - 29:24)
know they have to have all the Pokemon (29:22 - 29:26)
for the Hoenn tour right they don't have (29:24 - 29:28)
to but they don't have to but they (29:26 - 29:30)
should like the selling point is having (29:28 - 29:31)
all the Pokemon so it's like you do it (29:30 - 29:34)
now you get people excited and talking (29:31 - 29:35)
about it (29:34 - 29:38)
and then you get to double dip and (29:35 - 29:40)
reintroduce it again in a month (29:38 - 29:41)
where (29:40 - 29:43)
The Shining is there (29:41 - 29:45)
I know there's the like (29:43 - 29:48)
I personally like surprises like I had (29:45 - 29:50)
no clue they were doing kekland either (29:48 - 29:53)
until New Zealand (29:50 - 29:55)
was like we've got our New Zealand news (29:53 - 29:58)
uh I always like the surprise stuff I I (29:55 - 30:01)
mean you see this with with some things (29:58 - 30:02)
where people are like I wish they would (30:01 - 30:03)
announce this ahead of time I wasn't (30:02 - 30:05)
planning to do community day and now I'm (30:03 - 30:07)
gonna miss out and it's like I don't (30:05 - 30:09)
know like I get the (30:07 - 30:11)
announcing schedules of like here's all (30:09 - 30:13)
the Pokemon here's when Community Day is (30:11 - 30:15)
but like (30:13 - 30:16)
I think there's still a lot of value to (30:15 - 30:19)
having surprises in video games (30:16 - 30:21)
um especially when this is something (30:19 - 30:22)
that looks like it's gonna keep going (30:21 - 30:24)
and not be a limited time thing (30:22 - 30:27)
hopefully crossing my fingers for that (30:24 - 30:29)
um but if it is that then it's it's a (30:27 - 30:32)
nice surprise (30:29 - 30:32)
I I mean I tend to lean more towards let (30:32 - 30:39)
me plan than like I get the surprise (30:35 - 30:42)
feeling when you announced it (30:39 - 30:45)
like I don't need it I don't need it on (30:42 - 30:47)
the day when you announce it's coming (30:45 - 30:50)
that I've experienced the surprise it's (30:47 - 30:53)
not a it's not better the day of it's (30:50 - 30:55)
almost more annoying the day of because (30:53 - 30:57)
I'm like well I have already made plans (30:55 - 30:59)
for this evening so (30:57 - 31:02)
cool that told me a week ago and I would (30:59 - 31:05)
have just been surprised how dare you (31:02 - 31:08)
not put Pokemon gopher well you dare you (31:05 - 31:10)
not build your life around this game I (31:08 - 31:11)
mean (31:10 - 31:13)
it did seem like they were really trying (31:11 - 31:15)
to hold the surprise in until people got (31:13 - 31:19)
a chance to catch it that if you weren't (31:15 - 31:21)
paying attention to the news online (31:19 - 31:22)
weren't paying attention to people's (31:21 - 31:24)
twitters weren't paying attention to (31:22 - 31:26)
non-official announcements they didn't (31:24 - 31:29)
announce it until after the very end of (31:26 - 31:32)
the Pacific time zones Community Day so (31:29 - 31:34)
that gave plenty of people who don't pay (31:32 - 31:36)
attention to those news sources time to (31:34 - 31:38)
run into a kecleon and just have that be (31:36 - 31:40)
a completely new surprising thing which (31:38 - 31:43)
I think can be kind of cool yeah (31:40 - 31:46)
and I don't know they they did do it on (31:43 - 31:49)
a new Pokemon a starter Pokemon so it's (31:46 - 31:51)
not like (31:49 - 31:53)
again I I don't know how some players (31:51 - 31:55)
think but like I don't think Chespin was (31:53 - 31:58)
like a skippable community day (31:55 - 32:00)
there's a lot of people who do not like (31:58 - 32:03)
that Chespin line sure that's true sure (32:00 - 32:05)
I just feel like if if you're a day one (32:03 - 32:07)
Pokemon go player or you've just been (32:05 - 32:09)
playing for a long time it's like this (32:07 - 32:11)
is a brand new shiny might as well go (32:09 - 32:13)
out and at least get three of them or (32:11 - 32:15)
whatever or one of them to complete your (32:13 - 32:18)
line I mean there are people like me are (32:15 - 32:22)
like I have to leave early yeah so I (32:18 - 32:23)
mean I I had to leave like literally (32:22 - 32:25)
right on time just because I had an (32:23 - 32:28)
appointment as well so it's like (32:25 - 32:31)
had I known I might have made different (32:28 - 32:34)
Arrangements ahead of time but I mean (32:31 - 32:36)
I'm gonna be honest (32:34 - 32:39)
I wouldn't have like the only way I (32:36 - 32:40)
would have is that they announced like (32:39 - 32:44)
it's only happening after Community yeah (32:40 - 32:46)
yeah and it's only there for until the (32:44 - 32:47)
end of the day like then I would have (32:46 - 32:49)
like maybe have made arrangements to be (32:47 - 32:51)
like I'm gonna come later because I need (32:49 - 32:54)
to do this thing but knowing that super (32:51 - 32:56)
happy go Fest Hoenn time is coming up (32:54 - 32:57)
where everything's gonna be available I (32:56 - 32:59)
was like whatever (32:57 - 33:01)
yeah I get it when I get it it's keklian (32:59 - 33:04)
like right you get one and you'll (33:01 - 33:05)
probably never think about it again (33:04 - 33:06)
unless you really wanted to grind for (33:05 - 33:09)
the shiny or something into the box (33:06 - 33:11)
friend (33:09 - 33:11)
uh okay let's take a quick break and (33:11 - 33:16)

Pokemon news so we will be right back (33:16 - 33:26)

Dawn (34:11 - 34:15)
excuse me (34:12 - 34:18)
shiny Galleria in Rapidash okay well the (34:15 - 34:21)
pokemon.com does not state that it (34:18 - 34:22)
doesn't say that in the title at least (34:21 - 34:27)
uh we have oracoria or choreo Dazzle (34:22 - 34:29)
in Pokemon Master ZX this is all (34:27 - 34:31)
pokemon.com by the way (34:29 - 34:32)
um (34:31 - 34:34)
a new year is upon us and it brings two (34:32 - 34:36)
new sync pairs to Pokemon Masters ex (34:34 - 34:40)
contest spectacular Idol Eliza steps out (34:36 - 34:41)
with her new partner Pokemon Shiny (34:40 - 34:44)
glaring Rapidash Dawn returns in a new (34:41 - 34:46)
festive outfit with sensu style or (34:44 - 34:48)
choreo as her partner these two sync (34:46 - 34:50)
pairs will be around until January 17th (34:48 - 34:55)
2023 at 10 pm Pacific time it ends (34:50 - 34:56)
um (34:55 - 34:58)
and (34:56 - 35:03)
it looks like they are both (34:58 - 35:06)
oh I can't it doesn't usually it says if (35:03 - 35:08)
they're attackers or not they look like (35:06 - 35:09)
attackers (35:08 - 35:11)
am I missing that information on the (35:09 - 35:12)
website (35:11 - 35:14)
um I think (35:12 - 35:16)
I think the Rapidash is support let me (35:14 - 35:19)
look real quick (35:16 - 35:19)
because Greg is looking that up uh it (35:22 - 35:27)
says that they recommend recommended (35:24 - 35:29)
sync pair Partners to partner with the (35:27 - 35:33)
Rapidash you can do Phoebe and dusk Noir (35:29 - 35:35)
um (35:33 - 35:35)
and then for Dawn you can do where's my (35:36 - 35:42)
recommendation you could do mallow and (35:40 - 35:44)
Zarina recommended to pair with Dawn (35:42 - 35:46)
here (35:44 - 35:46)
uh don is a tech type sync pair I found (35:49 - 35:57)
at least Dawn yeah yeah uh this Ghost (35:54 - 36:02)
type Tech sync pair uh will have a rim (35:57 - 36:05)
rhythmic moves and they could put the (36:02 - 36:07)
other team at a disadvantage thanks to (36:05 - 36:09)
Teeter dance and feather dance which can (36:07 - 36:11)
confuse and lower the target's attack (36:09 - 36:14)
respective respectfully (36:11 - 36:16)
um if you have a sync pair that can (36:14 - 36:18)
boost Ally stats they will also enhance (36:16 - 36:21)
Dawns and oracoria's sync move elegant (36:18 - 36:26)
celebration ghost beam that's a mouthful (36:21 - 36:26)
which grows in strengths as all their (36:26 - 36:32)
stats are raised (36:30 - 36:36)
uh and the glaring Rapidash is a strike (36:32 - 36:39)
Striker yep (36:36 - 36:39)
yeah it just doesn't say that in the the (36:39 - 36:43)
dialogue I don't know why they they I (36:41 - 36:45)
don't know why they said that for Dawn (36:43 - 36:47)
but for the Rapidash they missed the (36:45 - 36:48)
mark there (36:47 - 36:50)
um (36:48 - 36:50)
uh these are cute (36:53 - 36:57)
Dawn fan but uh (36:54 - 37:00)
you know people like Don a lot of people (36:57 - 37:03)
like Don yeah there's a lot of Dons now (37:00 - 37:07)
I think Don is beginning to rival (37:03 - 37:09)
Erica (37:07 - 37:13)
as far as no one takes away from Erica (37:09 - 37:15)
Eric has one thing going for her that's (37:13 - 37:18)
Pokemon Masters EX (37:15 - 37:19)
um so (37:18 - 37:23)
the uh (37:19 - 37:23)
Eliza uh the Liza Rapidash it is a shiny (37:23 - 37:29)
it is uh (37:27 - 37:31)
uh uh shiny Galleria in Rapidash it is (37:29 - 37:36)
also uh a very very very good unit (37:31 - 37:37)
um like everywhere that I've looked is (37:36 - 37:41)
like 10 out of 10 try to get this one (37:37 - 37:44)
uh I have not been able to pull it yet (37:41 - 37:49)
however but overall it it does seem to (37:44 - 37:52)
be a very very good sync pair uh they (37:49 - 37:54)
also have a really big (37:52 - 37:56)
New Year's celebration happening right (37:54 - 37:58)
now where you're just getting free pull (37:56 - 38:01)
tickets again like you just get tickets (37:58 - 38:04)
to pull random units for free every day (38:01 - 38:06)
you log in and do their little super (38:04 - 38:07)
easy (38:06 - 38:09)
New Year's Event which is like here's (38:07 - 38:11)

pull tickets so uh (38:15 - 38:20)
that's happening for a while and then (38:17 - 38:22)
again log in so that you can possibly (38:20 - 38:24)
get a chance of winning a bunch of gems (38:22 - 38:26)
the New Year's events are pretty good (38:24 - 38:28)
they're pretty generous Greg when did (38:26 - 38:30)
they add this thing where you log in and (38:28 - 38:32)
like you know how you collect your gems (38:30 - 38:33)
because yeah that's the only thing I've (38:32 - 38:35)
been doing for the last like three four (38:33 - 38:37)
weeks is logging in just to collect gems (38:35 - 38:39)
uh because I'm gonna do that big that (38:37 - 38:41)
big spend poll uh before these units (38:39 - 38:45)
leave what why is the Pokemon popping up (38:41 - 38:47)
they added that for New Year's and I (38:45 - 38:50)
cannot tell you why I just got like an (38:47 - 38:53)
Arbok yeah yesterday was like a squirtle (38:50 - 38:57)
yeah did I miss the memo yes I mean the (38:53 - 39:00)
memo was hey these are gonna show up now (38:57 - 39:03)
why why I when the first showed up I (39:00 - 39:05)
thought do I click on it to get a bonus (39:03 - 39:07)
is there a no it's just there to be it's (39:05 - 39:09)
just there to celebrate your (39:07 - 39:11)
accomplishment of logging in and (39:09 - 39:12)
collecting (39:11 - 39:16)
maybe they took a cue from Pokemon home (39:12 - 39:18)
could be but it doesn't make as much (39:16 - 39:22)
sense here no yeah I (39:18 - 39:24)
if somebody knows the exact reason why (39:22 - 39:26)
our box is popping up when I'm (39:24 - 39:28)
collecting my 300 gems please tweet at (39:26 - 39:32)

uh I got a lot of gems though I'm very (39:32 - 39:36)
excited to do a bunch of polls uh yeah (39:34 - 39:38)
what what Banners are existing right now (39:36 - 39:42)
oh there are way too many banners (39:38 - 39:44)
because all of the new years are back (39:42 - 39:46)
the two New Years people are back the (39:44 - 39:49)
two we just said uh we got we got we got (39:46 - 39:54)

um we got Serena and regular Greninja (40:13 - 40:17)

uh there's a seasonal tiered there's a (40:17 - 40:24)
super Spotlight seasonal tiered there is (40:21 - 40:27)
a monthly Pokey fare that has Cynthia (40:24 - 40:30)
and Garchomp there is a lot I guess two (40:27 - 40:32)
of them are leaving though yeah (40:30 - 40:36)

yeah greninjas are uh (40:36 - 40:40)
heading out because they've been there (40:39 - 40:43)
for a long time yeah they were there all (40:40 - 40:46)
Christmas yeah yeah (40:43 - 40:48)
so quite quite a quite a bit in in (40:46 - 40:51)
Masters polling wise (40:48 - 40:51)
um (40:52 - 40:55)
all right let's we do have a little bit (40:53 - 40:57)
of scarlet and violet news (40:55 - 41:00)
um this is off pokemon.com as well (40:57 - 41:04)
uh running until (41:00 - 41:04)
so uh this is VGC related there was a (41:04 - 41:10)
tournament this weekend in (41:08 - 41:14)
San Diego was the first scarlet and (41:10 - 41:16)
violet tournament (41:14 - 41:18)
um I did watch some of the tournament uh (41:16 - 41:21)
there there is the part of me that is (41:18 - 41:24)
deeply annoyed that Community Day and (41:21 - 41:26)
tournaments and everything else Under (41:24 - 41:28)
the Sun is always the same weekend uh (41:26 - 41:31)
because uh there are people like me that (41:28 - 41:34)
like to experience everything Pokemon (41:31 - 41:36)
um and (41:34 - 41:39)
I can't spend the day watching a (41:36 - 41:41)
tournament and cleaning my house I have (41:39 - 41:43)
to go run to the mall to like catch (41:41 - 41:45)
shiny chesmen and find keckley out and (41:43 - 41:46)
then run back and the tournament's half (41:45 - 41:49)
over and it's whatever I get why they do (41:46 - 41:50)
it but (41:49 - 41:53)
it's a lot it also sucks for people at (41:50 - 41:54)
the tournament like if you're (41:53 - 41:57)
participating like good luck in between (41:54 - 42:00)
rounds trying to catch Chespin I guess (41:57 - 42:01)
um (42:00 - 42:05)
anyways uh every month the ranked (42:01 - 42:08)
Seasons reset (42:05 - 42:10)
um but we still had the same rules they (42:08 - 42:13)
are not officially changing the rules so (42:10 - 42:15)
uh the rules that started on December (42:13 - 42:17)
1st are the same rules that are running (42:15 - 42:19)
throughout this month but on January (42:17 - 42:23)
31st at 4 P.M Pacific Time ranked Battle (42:19 - 42:27)
season 2 will follow after (42:23 - 42:31)
season one regulations (42:27 - 42:35)
and then there are new eligible Pokemon (42:31 - 42:39)
which will be the Paradox Pokemon (42:35 - 42:43)
so not legendary still so there's still (42:39 - 42:45)
no box Legends still no (42:43 - 42:47)
what are they called (42:45 - 42:49)
ruined Treasures (42:47 - 42:50)
treasure (42:49 - 42:54)
something like that uh yeah the (42:50 - 42:56)
oh they have a name cursed Treasures or (42:54 - 42:58)
something like that they're like yeah (42:56 - 43:00)
the treasure Pokemon the bad treasure (42:58 - 43:02)
Pokemon uh (43:00 - 43:04)
so they're still not allowed but they're (43:02 - 43:08)
going to allow the Paradox Pokemon (43:04 - 43:11)
uh starting I believe February 1st I was (43:08 - 43:12)
seeing a number of people surprised by (43:11 - 43:15)
this that it's happening so quickly (43:12 - 43:18)
yeah I I was I I wasn't surprised that (43:15 - 43:20)
they cut the Paradox Pokemon right like (43:18 - 43:23)
that was not a shocker too yeah (43:20 - 43:23)
um (43:23 - 43:25)
even though like you can catch as many (43:23 - 43:28)
as you want and they they're very easy (43:25 - 43:30)
to get after you know you meet Ed (43:28 - 43:31)
Sheeran (43:30 - 43:32)
um (43:31 - 43:35)
it wasn't surprising to me that they did (43:32 - 43:36)
this because if you remember in sword (43:35 - 43:39)
and shield you could theoretically get (43:36 - 43:40)
all the gigantom X Pokemon within the (43:39 - 43:42)
first day or two right like yeah (43:40 - 43:44)
theoretically you could (43:42 - 43:47)
um like somebody just finds a (43:44 - 43:49)
gigantomax Kingler and you join it and (43:47 - 43:51)
you catch it and now you have it (43:49 - 43:52)
um (43:51 - 43:54)
and I don't know you just move your (43:52 - 43:55)
clock forward a million times and (43:54 - 43:58)
eventually you find all of them (43:55 - 44:00)
whether or not you like to do that it (43:58 - 44:03)
you can do that (44:00 - 44:04)
um (44:03 - 44:06)
but they didn't allow a lot of the (44:04 - 44:08)
gigantomax Pokemon for many seasons like (44:06 - 44:09)
I don't think they allowed checking into (44:08 - 44:11)
my clappers until season two or season (44:09 - 44:12)
three or something like that (44:11 - 44:15)
um so the (44:12 - 44:17)
the fact that they're allowing Paradox (44:15 - 44:20)
Pokemon so soon is a little surprising (44:17 - 44:22)
um but you know they can still slowly (44:20 - 44:23)
enter there will probably be a point (44:22 - 44:25)
where they allow the Hisui Pokemon right (44:23 - 44:26)
like (44:25 - 44:28)
here's the here's the Pokemon home (44:26 - 44:30)
update and starting next month you'll be (44:28 - 44:34)
able to use ursuluna and that will be (44:30 - 44:37)
its own like added on and here's the DLC (44:34 - 44:39)
and the DLC is introducing uh (44:37 - 44:41)
whimsicotta's back and now you can use (44:39 - 44:44)
whimsicott right like (44:41 - 44:46)
they probably have enough planned where (44:44 - 44:48)
this makes sense (44:46 - 44:50)
um on top of you know we'll probably end (44:48 - 44:53)
the whole series with Legends and Kyogre (44:50 - 44:56)
will be back and all that (44:53 - 44:56)
was per usual (44:57 - 45:02)
the tournament stuff at all (44:59 - 45:04)
no didn't have time no didn't have time (45:02 - 45:08)
the the thing that I noticed is (45:04 - 45:10)
look I don't I I do know some of the (45:08 - 45:12)
people that work at the Pokemon company (45:10 - 45:15)
that do the VGC stuff and the TCG stuff (45:12 - 45:17)
uh my question for you is what have you (45:15 - 45:18)
been doing the last couple months (45:17 - 45:20)
because why is All The Branding still (45:18 - 45:22)
zashi and in zamasenta why (45:20 - 45:26)
what like oops I I I I know it's just (45:22 - 45:30)
like a a standby title screen like the (45:26 - 45:32)
trivia stuff did they just not send you (45:30 - 45:35)
the pngs for practically like it doesn't (45:32 - 45:38)
have to be corridon or be ride on but (45:35 - 45:39)
like (45:38 - 45:42)
maybe the deadline is Pokemon day (45:39 - 45:44)
yeah I I don't know it was just very (45:42 - 45:45)
weird to be like (45:44 - 45:48)
yeah this like why is Kyogre on this (45:45 - 45:50)
graphic kyogre's not even in this game (45:48 - 45:52)
yet I mean I'm sure he will be (45:50 - 45:54)
eventually but like (45:52 - 45:57)
like I know for sure you guys have the (45:54 - 46:00)
pngs for quax Leaf Way Coco and (45:57 - 46:02)
sprigatito just use those (46:00 - 46:05)
like what this is their first tournament (46:02 - 46:09)
and we're still running everything (46:05 - 46:13)
production Wise from uh (46:09 - 46:16)
sword and shield it kind of takes you (46:13 - 46:18)
out of it a little bit you know you want (46:16 - 46:20)
in my mind you're like this is our first (46:18 - 46:21)
big scarlet and violet tournament and (46:20 - 46:23)
nothing is Scarlet and violet branded (46:21 - 46:24)
like what (46:23 - 46:26)
sounds like you can hop in there and I (46:24 - 46:27)
think you might be watching the wrong (46:26 - 46:30)
thing that's right (46:27 - 46:32)
when someone's not playing (46:30 - 46:37)
uh I remember uh in part gosh I I can't (46:32 - 46:40)
stand the twitch chat sometimes but it's (46:37 - 46:42)
very like it's not (46:40 - 46:44)
it is Twitch chat right like there there (46:42 - 46:46)
is there is I'm sure YouTube chat is (46:44 - 46:48)
just as bad because they stream on (46:46 - 46:49)
YouTube they stream on Twitch I'm I (46:48 - 46:52)
don't that make mixer was still alive (46:49 - 46:55)
I'm sure they'd stream my mixer uh but (46:52 - 46:58)
the moderation that the Pokemon like the (46:55 - 47:00)
Pokemon company again this is to the (46:58 - 47:01)
people who work at the Pokemon company (47:00 - 47:04)
you guys are bad at moderation like when (47:01 - 47:07)
somebody goes in and and says like oh (47:04 - 47:09)
you know Wolfie Glick got his match got (47:07 - 47:12)
banned because he he he he stole (47:09 - 47:14)
somebody's Pokemon cards right like a (47:12 - 47:18)
very bad bad like it's not a funny joke (47:14 - 47:21)
it's just it's just a bad joke like that (47:18 - 47:23)
person doesn't deserve a five minute (47:21 - 47:25)
timeout they're just going to come back (47:23 - 47:27)
in five minutes and make another bad (47:25 - 47:30)
joke time them out for the entire (47:27 - 47:32)
tournament give them a 48-hour timeout (47:30 - 47:35)
like I get that the Pokemon company (47:32 - 47:38)
wants everyone to feel welcomed and they (47:35 - 47:40)
don't want to do these harsh bands and (47:38 - 47:42)
I'm sure that (47:40 - 47:46)
somebody there is like not familiar with (47:42 - 47:48)
twitch chat and they were just like I'm (47:46 - 47:50)
in charge of this this weekend I have to (47:48 - 47:52)
read and moderate (47:50 - 47:54)
ban them for the entire weekend (47:52 - 47:57)
I I have sat in so many tournament chats (47:54 - 47:59)
where I've watched these people get two (47:57 - 48:00)
minute timeout or they just get their (47:59 - 48:02)
message deleted or they get a five (48:00 - 48:04)
minute time out and they come back and (48:02 - 48:06)
they still have the same terrible bad (48:04 - 48:09)
taste jokes and they ruin the experience (48:06 - 48:11)
for everyone and at the end of the day (48:09 - 48:13)
like (48:11 - 48:16)
there there is value in (48:13 - 48:18)
watching with other people right that's (48:16 - 48:20)
why these big events that's why Pokemon (48:18 - 48:21)
movies always have thousands of people (48:20 - 48:23)
watching them because like sometimes (48:21 - 48:26)
twitch chat is genuinely funny like at (48:23 - 48:27)
the end of the tournament there was a (48:26 - 48:30)
bunch of people being like I'm waiting (48:27 - 48:33)
for the movie and nowhere am I like (48:30 - 48:34)
where there's supposed to be a Pokemon (48:33 - 48:37)
movie after this and like half of twitch (48:34 - 48:39)
chat is like I'm so excited for the (48:37 - 48:41)
movie and the other half of twitch chat (48:39 - 48:42)
is like what are you talking about (48:41 - 48:45)
there's no movie and I'm like I need to (48:42 - 48:47)
see the end I need to see if there's a (48:45 - 48:48)
movie and so we're all waiting and (48:47 - 48:50)
watching and all of a sudden the stream (48:48 - 48:52)
ends because they're like goodbye and (48:50 - 48:54)
half a twitch I was like where's the (48:52 - 48:56)
movie and the other half of twitch chat (48:54 - 48:58)
is like nah wait wait it out the movie (48:56 - 49:00)
you're still here we're sitting in an (48:58 - 49:02)
empty Channel there's nothing on the (49:00 - 49:04)
screen and I'm like well I guess they (49:02 - 49:06)
were lying of course twitch chat was (49:04 - 49:08)
lying there's no movie and then all of a (49:06 - 49:09)
sudden twitch chat's like refreshed (49:08 - 49:11)
refresh and we refresh and there's a (49:09 - 49:14)
movie neon the shaman movie came on and (49:11 - 49:16)
I was like this is the twitch chat I (49:14 - 49:18)
loved half of these people were so (49:16 - 49:20)
convinced that a movie was gonna there (49:18 - 49:21)
was a movie (49:20 - 49:24)
I was like I guess we're watching the (49:21 - 49:26)
shaman movie now (49:24 - 49:28)
and it was great and that's the twitch (49:26 - 49:31)
chat I absolutely love but it is so (49:28 - 49:33)
frustrating watching these tournaments (49:31 - 49:36)
and having the worst moderation in the (49:33 - 49:37)
world because (49:36 - 49:40)
the employees at the Pokemon company are (49:37 - 49:43)
so scared to like ban these people no (49:40 - 49:45)
just ban them they are not adding (49:43 - 49:49)
anything of value like there was a year (49:45 - 49:51)
like six months ago (49:49 - 49:54)
one of the people in twitch chat uh said (49:51 - 49:56)
that there was like a bomb in the (49:54 - 49:59)
building not a funny joke at all like (49:56 - 50:01)
the stream went down like the stream (49:59 - 50:03)
just cut went black which is a normal (50:01 - 50:04)
thing for poke because their production (50:03 - 50:06)
is like not the greatest right I I was (50:04 - 50:09)
watching my friend Joe ux9 it was the (50:06 - 50:11)
top four of I think it was Pokemon (50:09 - 50:14)
Nationals the whole stream cut and then (50:11 - 50:17)
somebody made like a bomb threat joke (50:14 - 50:19)
there is no joke there right like to (50:17 - 50:21)
them it was a joke nothing about that is (50:19 - 50:24)
funny and that person got a five minute (50:21 - 50:27)
time out and they came back after five (50:24 - 50:28)
minutes and they were still chatting (50:27 - 50:31)
like that is unacceptable like there is (50:28 - 50:33)
there's no that person should be (50:31 - 50:36)
permaband like if I was moderating that (50:33 - 50:37)
twitch chat and somebody made these (50:36 - 50:40)
these really tasteless jokes they would (50:37 - 50:42)
be banned for at least the tournament (50:40 - 50:45)
weekend and they would understand oh (50:42 - 50:48)
uh that wasn't cool maybe the next (50:45 - 50:51)
tournament in three weeks I can I can (50:48 - 50:54)
come back but in a situation like that (50:51 - 50:56)
those and again like I get it they could (50:54 - 50:58)
make a new account right they could just (50:56 - 51:00)
come back in it's very easy to make a (50:58 - 51:03)
new account on Twitch but it ruins the (51:00 - 51:05)
experience for people who are trying to (51:03 - 51:07)
watch and have a good time and or just (51:05 - 51:10)
like learn about the game especially (51:07 - 51:14)
that we have a new game so I really (51:10 - 51:17)
was a bit frustrated with this (51:14 - 51:20)
tournament because none of the branding (51:17 - 51:22)
was new I don't need to look at Kyogre (51:20 - 51:24)
or zashin anymore I love those two (51:22 - 51:26)
Pokemon they're great they they (51:24 - 51:28)
obviously carried the end of sword and (51:26 - 51:30)
shield but like your first tournament of (51:28 - 51:33)
the Season no new branding the same bad (51:30 - 51:35)
moderation in twitch chat the only thing (51:33 - 51:36)
you did right was you put a movie at the (51:35 - 51:38)
end and that was great (51:36 - 51:41)
but (51:38 - 51:43)
um I don't know I also felt like the (51:41 - 51:45)
commentating team was they didn't seem (51:43 - 51:47)
like super excited maybe they were tired (51:45 - 51:50)
maybe the production on the back end (51:47 - 51:53)
hard to say right like uh hard to say (51:50 - 51:55)
what was happening on the back end (51:53 - 51:57)
um it seemed like there hasn't been as (51:55 - 51:59)
much support as they've needed for some (51:57 - 52:01)
of the people running these events at (51:59 - 52:03)
least from the things I've seen on (52:01 - 52:05)
social media from some of the earlier (52:03 - 52:07)
events in the last few months (52:05 - 52:08)
it sounded like they needed more support (52:07 - 52:10)
and more communication at least a little (52:08 - 52:13)
bit which isn't uncommon for huge events (52:10 - 52:15)
and I'm not saying I've ever worked one (52:13 - 52:18)
of these and I've barely been to any but (52:15 - 52:22)
it doesn't seem super Pleasant (52:18 - 52:24)
yeah I mean when I was at the Milwaukee (52:22 - 52:28)
regionals it ran incredibly smoothly (52:24 - 52:30)
um and which is was shocking to me (52:28 - 52:32)
because you know when I when I would go (52:30 - 52:35)
to various regionals or or weekend (52:32 - 52:37)
tournaments when I was TCG playing (52:35 - 52:40)
you were you were committing your whole (52:37 - 52:42)
day and in between rounds it would be (52:40 - 52:44)
like well I can't like leave because I (52:42 - 52:45)
don't know how fast the run is gonna (52:44 - 52:48)
start and I don't want to get a penalty (52:45 - 52:50)
for not being in my seat in time (52:48 - 52:51)
um but they ran it really really (52:50 - 52:53)
smoothly so (52:51 - 52:55)
but yeah every tournament organizer (52:53 - 52:57)
every to is different so I'm not sure (52:55 - 53:01)
how the TOs were running San Diego there (52:57 - 53:02)
there did seem to be a lot of downtime (53:01 - 53:05)
between matches but I (53:02 - 53:08)
I (53:05 - 53:08)
you have a corporate moderation (53:09 - 53:15)
corporate corporate companies (53:11 - 53:20)
across the board are way way too lenient (53:15 - 53:24)
on moderation like I I'm not gonna say (53:20 - 53:27)
this is only a Pokemon problem this is a (53:24 - 53:30)
corporate not the corporate culture of (53:27 - 53:33)
not angering potential customers and (53:30 - 53:36)
creating bad PR by doing something (53:33 - 53:40)
extreme is so prevalent that they can't (53:36 - 53:42)
see the other side of the equation right (53:40 - 53:44)
like (53:42 - 53:47)
this isn't just a Pokemon problem but I (53:44 - 53:51)
I want anybody anybody out there to (53:47 - 53:54)
understand that when you allow toxic (53:51 - 53:58)
elements to remain even if you kick them (53:54 - 54:01)
like the idea like the idea that I (53:58 - 54:03)
kicked them out for 48 hours and they're (54:01 - 54:05)
going to learn their lesson and not and (54:03 - 54:07)
come back next time they never learn (54:05 - 54:09)
their lesson right these aren't people (54:07 - 54:11)
that are that unless you're sitting them (54:09 - 54:14)
down and saying here's the 15 things you (54:11 - 54:16)
did wrong and they are open to that (54:14 - 54:18)
feedback are not going to change they (54:16 - 54:21)
are just going to be toxic and the (54:18 - 54:23)
chances of them learning are probably (54:21 - 54:25)
less than them coming back more Angry (54:23 - 54:27)
the next time right because now they've (54:25 - 54:31)
got a thing to prove corporations across (54:27 - 54:35)
the board need to get more severe with (54:31 - 54:37)
their moderation (54:35 - 54:40)
as a rule they need to understand that (54:37 - 54:43)
you when you when you are tepid about it (54:40 - 54:46)
you are signaling to people that you are (54:43 - 54:49)
tolerating toxic behavior and that toxic (54:46 - 54:52)
behavior only gets a slap on the wrist (54:49 - 54:54)
and it drives the people you want away (54:52 - 54:55)
correct (54:54 - 54:58)
yeah it's it's one of the reasons why I (54:55 - 54:59)
want (54:58 - 55:01)
to have the day free for these (54:59 - 55:03)
tournaments so I can like host them on (55:01 - 55:06)
my twitch Channel and so people can (55:03 - 55:08)
uh so I can look I can be like here (55:06 - 55:10)
here's my insight of what's Happening (55:08 - 55:12)
not that the commentators do a bad job (55:10 - 55:14)
they're fine (55:12 - 55:16)
um but like (55:14 - 55:18)
I want to watch I want to watch it (55:16 - 55:21)
without like a toxic twitch chat is (55:18 - 55:22)
really what it comes down to yeah I want (55:21 - 55:23)
to sit there and watch it with a (55:22 - 55:25)
community that like it genuinely is (55:23 - 55:28)
asking questions uh who like wants to (55:25 - 55:31)
learn who get excited about big plays (55:28 - 55:33)
like for the people that are like we'll (55:31 - 55:35)
just close twitch chat that like that (55:33 - 55:37)
defeats the whole purpose of like (55:35 - 55:39)
watching it like like it like you could (55:37 - 55:42)
say like it's why it's why some people (55:39 - 55:43)
like going to the movies because they (55:42 - 55:45)
want to hear like the reaction of other (55:43 - 55:47)
people in the movies like there there is (55:45 - 55:48)
there is (55:47 - 55:51)
um what's the word for it (55:48 - 55:51)
like a sense of community almost there (55:51 - 55:56)
there is power in shared experiences (55:54 - 55:59)
right like live theater has a shared (55:56 - 56:02)
experience anything you're seeing with a (55:59 - 56:04)
group has the power of shared experience (56:02 - 56:07)
and when you allow a toxic element to (56:04 - 56:09)
remain like (56:07 - 56:12)
there have been like there have been a (56:09 - 56:14)
number of people who have stood up at (56:12 - 56:17)
plays that I'm in and screamed at the (56:14 - 56:18)
actors (56:17 - 56:20)
and (56:18 - 56:22)
people freeze because the audience (56:20 - 56:25)
doesn't know what to do and if (56:22 - 56:29)
the theater doesn't come in and force (56:25 - 56:33)
that person out you are literally saying (56:29 - 56:35)
that was fine (56:33 - 56:38)
interrupt our entire thing it's fine we (56:35 - 56:41)
tolerate that here like (56:38 - 56:43)
it frustrates me it frustrates me that (56:41 - 56:47)
people aren't willing to actually take (56:43 - 56:53)
the necessary steps to create a safe and (56:47 - 56:54)
non-toxic environment because you're (56:53 - 56:57)
quote unquote going to lose customers (56:54 - 56:59)
the people who are mad that you (56:57 - 57:01)
moderated are the people you don't want (56:59 - 57:03)
around anyway (57:01 - 57:05)
I I just think the the people who are in (57:03 - 57:07)
charge of moderation are too scared to (57:05 - 57:09)
do anything yeah like they're going to (57:07 - 57:11)
get like yelled at by the other people (57:09 - 57:14)
also don't understand twitch like right (57:11 - 57:16)
I understand twitch obviously I've been (57:14 - 57:17)
on Twitch for a long time and the (57:16 - 57:20)
moderation tools there are so good like (57:17 - 57:21)
I don't know what it is like for YouTube (57:20 - 57:24)
I think YouTube chat is like really hard (57:21 - 57:25)
to read as a viewer (57:24 - 57:26)
um and that's probably the main (57:25 - 57:29)
complaint of like live YouTube is like (57:26 - 57:31)
their chat experience is not nearly as (57:29 - 57:33)
good as twitch but it's really easy to (57:31 - 57:35)
click as a moderator to click on (57:33 - 57:36)
somebody's name and like look through (57:35 - 57:38)
look through their history and I bet I (57:36 - 57:40)
bet the people moderating over a Pokemon (57:38 - 57:42)
don't know how to do that like it is so (57:40 - 57:44)
easy to click on a name and be like yes (57:42 - 57:45)
this person has done nothing but make (57:44 - 57:48)
very uh tasteless jokes for the last 48 (57:45 - 57:51)
hours and like yeah you Greg is like (57:48 - 57:53)
right in the sense of like they probably (57:51 - 57:55)
won't learn anything but if you do it if (57:53 - 57:57)
you do a 48-hour ban (57:55 - 57:59)
they're they're they're at least done (57:57 - 58:00)
for the weekend (57:59 - 58:02)
and (58:00 - 58:04)
um they're not going to get too upset (58:02 - 58:06)
that their account is permaband (58:04 - 58:08)
um so they're they're less likely to go (58:06 - 58:10)
make a new account right because they (58:08 - 58:11)
don't see that they're permaband they (58:10 - 58:13)
just seem that they can't talk for 48 (58:11 - 58:16)
hours and in that situation you're (58:13 - 58:17)
already defusing now I'm not saying (58:16 - 58:18)
you're diffusing all of them there will (58:17 - 58:20)
still probably be more people that run (58:18 - 58:23)
to make a new account to come back to (58:20 - 58:25)
start talking again but removing their (58:23 - 58:26)
power to make (58:25 - 58:30)
these very bad jokes or to just be (58:26 - 58:31)
annoying it doesn't even have to be (58:30 - 58:33)
jokes it's just like some people are (58:31 - 58:37)
obnoxiously annoying or or whatnot (58:33 - 58:39)
um (58:37 - 58:39)
you you you you (58:39 - 58:44)
overall don't encourage that for other (58:42 - 58:48)
people yep and like like Hannah said the (58:44 - 58:49)
toxic people are pushing away the people (58:48 - 58:51)
that genuinely want to like be there and (58:49 - 58:54)
have a good time I guarantee that the (58:51 - 58:56)
people that they've all moderating that (58:54 - 58:58)
isn't their full-time job (58:56 - 59:00)
oh yeah I'm sure I guarantee it's like (58:58 - 59:02)
who's stuck doing this thing that you do (59:00 - 59:04)
maybe once a month and have no clue and (59:02 - 59:06)
you're like somebody has to do it like (59:04 - 59:08)
they (59:06 - 59:11)
there are so many ways that corporations (59:08 - 59:14)
across the board need to understand how (59:11 - 59:16)
you need to hire into social media (59:14 - 59:18)
positions and you have to hire people (59:16 - 59:22)
who know how social media works and how (59:18 - 59:25)
to cultivate a social media presence but (59:22 - 59:26)
also (59:25 - 59:29)
it has been my experience that the upper (59:26 - 59:32)
levels of our Corporation don't (59:29 - 59:34)
understand it and so when you make a big (59:32 - 59:36)
decision you are more likely to get in (59:34 - 59:39)
trouble for making a big decision than (59:36 - 59:41)
and which was the right decision but (59:39 - 59:44)
they don't understand it so like it's (59:41 - 59:46)
it's sort of a no-win situation for (59:44 - 59:48)
people who are stuck on these things but (59:46 - 59:50)
I do think like we need to get a point (59:48 - 59:53)
especially in 2023 because this is (59:50 - 59:55)
social media has been around (59:53 - 59:59)
a long time now that across all levels (59:55 - 60:02)
they they just generally need to get (59:59 - 60:04)
more strict about (60:02 - 60:06)
what they're doing (60:04 - 60:09)
um and I get it gets really murky it's (60:06 - 60:11)
really hard because a lot of it is (60:09 - 60:14)
personal and subjective and (60:11 - 60:18)
it's a murky area but like (60:14 - 60:20)
people have successfully worked through (60:18 - 60:22)
the Merc before right you can (60:20 - 60:24)
successfully have very very clear (60:22 - 60:27)
policies and follow those policies and (60:24 - 60:29)
support the people who make those (60:27 - 60:31)
decisions (60:29 - 60:31)
yeah it's uh (60:34 - 60:39)
it's uh not the not the first not the (60:36 - 60:42)
first uh (60:39 - 60:43)
Tournament of the year that I wanted to (60:42 - 60:46)
watch that was like what's happening (60:43 - 60:49)
right now room for improvement (60:46 - 60:53)
I guess we can only go up yeah (60:49 - 60:54)
um (60:53 - 60:57)
what was our last bit of news here I'm (60:54 - 61:00)
back to master rank and unite or that oh (60:57 - 61:02)
nice congrats on mastering I'm back to (61:00 - 61:04)
back to right and dragapult is here (61:02 - 61:08)
unite was not in the docket today Greg (61:04 - 61:11)
give me my 10 second unite info is (61:08 - 61:14)
Dragon Paul good Dragon halt's good (61:11 - 61:16)
um (61:14 - 61:18)
it is (61:16 - 61:21)
a little complicated to play as far as I (61:18 - 61:23)
can tell but but right now it's in a (61:21 - 61:24)
good spot I think some people are saying (61:23 - 61:26)
it's overpowered but that is how every (61:24 - 61:28)
new character people feel every new (61:26 - 61:30)
character in this line was not (61:28 - 61:31)
overpowered when he arrived now ma'am (61:30 - 61:33)
and I was out of more powerful news (61:31 - 61:35)
right after stable I who is my new Mane (61:33 - 61:37)
is overpowered and I love it but uh (61:35 - 61:40)
dragon pulse here it's good I think (61:37 - 61:42)
this state of the game is the same the (61:40 - 61:44)
Rayquaza changes they made are really (61:42 - 61:45)
bad (61:44 - 61:47)
um (61:45 - 61:50)
uh but overall I think the balance of (61:47 - 61:52)
all the classes are are pretty good (61:50 - 61:54)
right now uh it's just again they need (61:52 - 61:56)
to undo (61:54 - 61:59)
the Rayquaza changes but I'm back to (61:56 - 62:02)
master rank I think there's another (61:59 - 62:05)
four days in this ranking season uh (62:02 - 62:07)
before it all refreshes there's a new (62:05 - 62:10)
superhero full Fury fight uh so if (62:07 - 62:12)
you've never done the full Fury Battles (62:10 - 62:15)
those are back and they're super fun (62:12 - 62:17)
um (62:15 - 62:19)
and the New Year celebration is (62:17 - 62:20)
happening and I think that lasts for (62:19 - 62:22)
another (62:20 - 62:25)
15 16 days so you can get a bunch of (62:22 - 62:27)
free stuff uh by just by playing for New (62:25 - 62:31)
Year's uh coins and it's basically coins (62:27 - 62:33)
and tickets and item and answers (62:31 - 62:36)
got it uh this is off comicbook.com (62:33 - 62:40)
Pokemon squishmallows will return (62:36 - 62:41)
I only know I only knew this was a (62:40 - 62:44)
problem because of tick tock because (62:41 - 62:47)
Tick Tock some somebody on Tick Tock (62:44 - 62:48)
said that the squishmallows had a big (62:47 - 62:51)
recall yeah because and it'll spread (62:48 - 62:54)
like but it did but like it did it (62:51 - 62:56)
didn't (62:54 - 62:58)
that's why we pulled the article (62:56 - 63:01)
because and I know from our podcast and (62:58 - 63:03)
from at least our community (63:01 - 63:06)
they wanted the squishmallows and I said (63:03 - 63:07)
hey the squishmallows are going to go up (63:06 - 63:09)
on and when I I was like I bet when the (63:07 - 63:10)
squish bottles go up they're gonna sell (63:09 - 63:11)
out they sold out like 15 minutes right (63:10 - 63:13)
like they sold out incredibly fast uh (63:11 - 63:15)
there there is a restock so if you take (63:13 - 63:17)
anything away from this news there will (63:15 - 63:19)
be a restock (63:17 - 63:20)
um (63:19 - 63:22)
so uh (63:20 - 63:24)
so the squishmallows originally came out (63:22 - 63:26)
on pokemoncenter.com it was a Pikachu (63:24 - 63:28)
and a Gengar that was in November (63:26 - 63:30)
and then they sold out in like 10 (63:28 - 63:31)
seconds yep (63:30 - 63:35)
um they will return to stores in (63:31 - 63:38)
February and a representative stated (63:35 - 63:41)
that the items were not recalled due to (63:38 - 63:43)
online speculation (63:41 - 63:47)
yeah this this Tick Tock article isn't (63:43 - 63:49)
great because basically somebody saw (63:47 - 63:51)
them in a Walmart (63:49 - 63:53)
said they're in Walmart Walmart probably (63:51 - 63:56)
something from the company probably saw (63:53 - 63:59)
hey Walmart you broke Street date (63:56 - 64:00)
whether you're supposed to get them off (63:59 - 64:03)
the floor that's what happened they ran (64:00 - 64:05)
out and grabbed them off the floor and (64:03 - 64:08)
then some Rando said oh my gosh there's (64:05 - 64:09)
something wrong with them they've been (64:08 - 64:12)
recalled it's like no they they broke (64:09 - 64:13)
Street date (64:12 - 64:17)
somebody put them out early yeah the (64:13 - 64:18)
quote here from the representative was (64:17 - 64:20)
squishmallows and Pokemon are not being (64:18 - 64:23)
recalled they were simply set out a bit (64:20 - 64:26)
early fans can expect to see them roll (64:23 - 64:28)
out soon for purchase that happens (64:26 - 64:30)
sometimes stock Will Go On the Floor a (64:28 - 64:31)
bit early and the systems have not (64:30 - 64:32)
caught up yet (64:31 - 64:34)
they weren't supposed to be put on (64:32 - 64:37)
shelves until February honest my my my (64:34 - 64:39)
guess is they were probably going to be (64:37 - 64:44)
saved closer to Pokemon day yeah because (64:39 - 64:46)
why not put them out right now if (64:44 - 64:48)
they're in stores because February is (64:46 - 64:49)
Pokemon day and they'd love to have a (64:48 - 64:52)
bunch of Pokemon merch New or Old (64:49 - 64:54)
returning a week or two before Pokemon (64:52 - 64:57)
day a week or two after Pokemon day (64:54 - 64:58)
um (64:57 - 65:04)
that that's it there was the the (64:58 - 65:07)
somebody posted I went to Walmart and (65:04 - 65:09)
here's a bunch of squishmallows I saw (65:07 - 65:10)
that Tick Tock I was like and I thought (65:09 - 65:12)
to myself huh (65:10 - 65:14)
I don't know where Walmart is but maybe (65:12 - 65:15)
I should go look to see if they have (65:14 - 65:18)
squishmallows uh but there shouldn't be (65:15 - 65:19)
any anymore (65:18 - 65:23)
but they will come back next month so (65:19 - 65:25)
uh just clearing things up do we even (65:23 - 65:29)
have Walmarts in Minneapolis (65:25 - 65:33)
yes we i i i in the land of Target I'd (65:29 - 65:35)
yeah I mean nobody nobody goes to (65:33 - 65:37)
Walmart because Target is vastly (65:35 - 65:39)
superior also it's a local business so (65:37 - 65:41)
when you're shopping Target you are (65:39 - 65:42)
shopping locally (65:41 - 65:44)
uh no there's a bunch of Walmarts (65:42 - 65:47)
there's a Walmart right out by you is (65:44 - 65:50)
there yes I have no clue I don't think (65:47 - 65:51)
I've ever seen a Walmart in this this (65:50 - 65:53)
area you've probably seen it you (65:51 - 65:56)
probably just haven't yeah why would you (65:53 - 65:57)
go (65:56 - 65:59)
oh yeah I mean that's true why would I (65:57 - 66:03)
go and I would go to the targets (65:59 - 66:03)
um (66:05 - 66:08)
Hannah you didn't get a squish mellow (66:06 - 66:09)
yet right you they were they sold out on (66:08 - 66:12)
you they sold out way too quickly I (66:09 - 66:14)
wasn't even positive I was gonna get one (66:12 - 66:15)
I had considered it and then before I (66:14 - 66:19)
could make a decision they were out yeah (66:15 - 66:21)
but I was expecting them to come back I (66:19 - 66:23)
had heard the first bit of news like you (66:21 - 66:25)
did I had no idea there were people (66:23 - 66:27)
saying that it was a recall (66:25 - 66:31)
what would they recall like (66:27 - 66:34)
um occasionally (66:31 - 66:36)
pull them back (66:34 - 66:38)
they're too squishy we've lost three (66:36 - 66:40)
children into the Vortex of the (66:38 - 66:42)
squishmallow (66:40 - 66:45)
they're too huggables they're too (66:42 - 66:47)
huggable this child has to release (66:45 - 66:50)
theirselves November pull them make them (66:47 - 66:53)
feel worse (66:50 - 66:55)
hey I mean isn't Target selling uh (66:53 - 66:58)
breakup bears for Valentine's Day or (66:55 - 66:59)
something like that (66:58 - 67:03)
that's not horrific what (66:59 - 67:03)
has another tick tock (67:04 - 67:10)
what what like you know how you get like (67:07 - 67:13)
bears with like hearts for Valentine's (67:10 - 67:15)
Day right they have like bears that like (67:13 - 67:18)
the heart was like ripped in half like (67:15 - 67:21)
so long good luck (67:18 - 67:24)
that's bad (67:21 - 67:24)
laughs (67:25 - 67:31)
this has been an episode (67:28 - 67:31)
um (67:33 - 67:37)
I go to Target a lot like literally I go (67:34 - 67:39)
to the Target I have not seen this (67:37 - 67:43)
is starting to start for Valentine's Day (67:39 - 67:45)
yeah Greg you walk in you get your (67:43 - 67:47)
Gengar squish mellow and your breakup (67:45 - 67:48)
bear (67:47 - 67:51)
oh wait no hold on target Walmart's the (67:48 - 67:52)
ones that I don't actually know if other (67:51 - 67:54)
stores are supposed to be carrying these (67:52 - 67:56)
squishmallows I bet they are doesn't (67:54 - 67:57)
Walmart have a deal with squishmallow (67:56 - 67:59)
though I feel like (67:57 - 68:03)
I I have seen videos of Walmart (67:59 - 68:05)
employees putting out brand new squish (68:03 - 68:08)
Bellows and people like emptying the the (68:05 - 68:11)
huge bin instantly because Swiss Mellows (68:08 - 68:14)
are popular I mean I know you can get (68:11 - 68:16)
squishmallows at Target I've seen them (68:14 - 68:20)
yeah definitely seen them elsewhere (68:16 - 68:22)
so I don't think it's exclusive I don't (68:20 - 68:25)
think I don't think (68:22 - 68:27)
Pokemon would do an exclusive Walmart (68:25 - 68:32)
only squish mellow thing (68:27 - 68:32)
but I think there are exclusive (68:32 - 68:38)
squishmallows that you can only get at (68:35 - 68:39)
certain (68:38 - 68:42)
Outlets yeah like I think you can only (68:39 - 68:44)
get (68:42 - 68:46)
one of them at Target and you can only (68:44 - 68:48)
get one of them at Walmart or something (68:46 - 68:50)
I don't know they do those weird like oh (68:48 - 68:52)
this is the only one you can get like (68:50 - 68:53)
they do that with action figures too (68:52 - 68:56)
which just boggles my mind I think I (68:53 - 68:57)
think they do it with amiibos as well (68:56 - 68:59)
where certain amiibos were only (68:57 - 69:02)
available at certain stores (68:59 - 69:02)
ah anyways uh I think that's it that's (69:03 - 69:08)
all the Pokemon news we have (69:06 - 69:09)
um (69:08 - 69:11)
obviously we'll be back next week (69:09 - 69:13)
I (69:11 - 69:16)
don't know what (69:13 - 69:19)
scarlet and violet stuff we should be (69:16 - 69:21)
expecting but (69:19 - 69:25)
Joe Mr Mr serebii.net said that like (69:21 - 69:27)
they will be talking about scarlet and (69:25 - 69:30)
violet on some TV show which to be fair (69:27 - 69:31)
just because they're talking about it (69:30 - 69:33)
doesn't mean it's like breaking or huge (69:31 - 69:35)
news it could be something as simple but (69:33 - 69:39)
uh I would I would assume that (69:35 - 69:41)
they are going to start their press (69:39 - 69:43)
cycle of talking about Pokemon that (69:41 - 69:45)
aren't the initial 30 Pokemon they've (69:43 - 69:48)
talked about before (69:45 - 69:51)
um we have gotten really nothing on on (69:48 - 69:53)
the US Pokemon website or the Japanese (69:51 - 69:55)
Pokemon website about (69:53 - 69:58)
uh newer Pokemon (69:55 - 69:59)
and now that the first tournament has (69:58 - 70:01)
happened and now that it's the new year (69:59 - 70:03)
and now that people are getting back to (70:01 - 70:05)
work and maybe updating graphics for (70:03 - 70:07)
tournaments I don't know uh that we'll (70:05 - 70:10)
be starting to talk about (70:07 - 70:12)
the however I don't even know how many (70:10 - 70:14)
new Pokemon were introduced in scarlet (70:12 - 70:17)
and violet was like 89 90 something like (70:14 - 70:22)
like oh gosh I think they're at 1008 (70:17 - 70:25)
and is the final Pokedex number and I (70:22 - 70:28)
think after (70:25 - 70:28)
um (70:28 - 70:34)
no Hisui yeah was 905 so we would have (70:30 - 70:36)
been at 103. (70:34 - 70:38)
new Pokemon (70:36 - 70:40)
which seems very high (70:38 - 70:42)
did they really do that many Pokemon in (70:40 - 70:44)
scrolling Violet 103. there are a lot (70:42 - 70:47)
there are a lot yeah yeah (70:44 - 70:49)
all right next weekend is cinderace (70:47 - 70:51)
weekend again right yeah yeah cinderize (70:49 - 70:53)
comes back so um (70:51 - 70:55)
uh ideally by the time this podcast goes (70:53 - 70:58)
up uh there should be a YouTube video I (70:55 - 70:59)
did breaking down what's actually (70:58 - 71:02)
happening in a Raid Battle (70:59 - 71:03)
um (71:02 - 71:06)
uh we're still at the point where (71:03 - 71:07)
I don't think people are understanding (71:06 - 71:09)
what's happening in raid battles (71:07 - 71:11)
we're still at a point where people (71:09 - 71:12)
don't know what the cheer button does (71:11 - 71:13)
maybe they don't even know where the (71:12 - 71:15)
cheer button is yeah well maybe they've (71:13 - 71:17)
been stuck on the cheer button for five (71:15 - 71:18)
minutes while they watch the rest of the (71:17 - 71:20)
raid happen around them which is my (71:18 - 71:24)
common experience where I'm like yep at (71:20 - 71:26)
least you got stuck like you were trying (71:24 - 71:29)
to help Greg here (71:26 - 71:29)
that's what you got punished I got (71:31 - 71:35)
punished for trying to help which is (71:33 - 71:38)
really how you want the help functions (71:35 - 71:41)
in your games to work some of the most (71:38 - 71:43)
important buttons in the raid the heel (71:41 - 71:45)
the attack boost and the defense boost (71:43 - 71:49)
there was one time where I hit the help (71:45 - 71:51)
button it (71:49 - 71:55)
poppy into the back of the iron hands (71:51 - 71:58)
and never let me go so all I had was a (71:55 - 72:00)
Silver Screen (71:58 - 72:04)
and occasional notifications that sound (72:00 - 72:06)
was going on and then (72:04 - 72:08)
after the raid was over I finally got my (72:06 - 72:10)
menu screen I'm like this is (72:08 - 72:14)
I have no idea I'm glad you all won (72:10 - 72:17)
because I was useless apparently (72:14 - 72:20)
I've had it where I went to go heel (72:17 - 72:22)
cheer I think where where it gets stuck (72:20 - 72:24)
at least every time I've gotten stuck (72:22 - 72:27)
it's because somebody has either defense (72:24 - 72:29)
cheer somebody has cheered and then I've (72:27 - 72:32)
tried to cheer and that seems where I (72:29 - 72:34)
get stuck is when another cheer goes off (72:32 - 72:36)
because when somebody cheers at pants (72:34 - 72:39)
normally to that character and then you (72:36 - 72:41)
see them like do like the fist in the (72:39 - 72:42)
air kind of thing (72:41 - 72:45)
but when I got the last time I got stuck (72:42 - 72:47)
um I was stuck for you know several (72:45 - 72:49)
minutes and then my menu came back but (72:47 - 72:52)
the cheer menu was still overlaid on top (72:49 - 72:53)
of my menu (72:52 - 72:56)
so there was too menus on top of each (72:53 - 72:58)
other I was still able to play and like (72:56 - 73:00)
kind of like see through it (72:58 - 73:01)
um (73:00 - 73:04)
that is not what the video I I worked on (73:01 - 73:08)
the video I worked on explained (73:04 - 73:12)
um how the boss's Shield Works uh (73:08 - 73:13)
because I think and I say this in the (73:12 - 73:15)
YouTube video (73:13 - 73:18)
I think that some players (73:15 - 73:21)
want to One-Shot the boss because they (73:18 - 73:23)
don't want to deal with the shield (73:21 - 73:25)
and The Shield is there to intend to (73:23 - 73:27)
make the boss harder right The Shield is (73:25 - 73:29)
there as like this is a very common (73:27 - 73:31)
thing in Final Fantasy 14 or destiny you (73:29 - 73:33)
know these games with MMO mechanics (73:31 - 73:36)
where like there is a round one of (73:33 - 73:39)
damage and then there's a round two and (73:36 - 73:43)
I round one was built normally of like (73:39 - 73:46)
are you good enough to get to round two (73:43 - 73:47)
um (73:46 - 73:50)
and some people (73:47 - 73:52)
I think are misunderstanding why the (73:50 - 73:57)
shield goes up and I I say in the video (73:52 - 73:59)
that there might not be an opportunity (73:57 - 74:02)
where we can one shot all future bosses (73:59 - 74:06)
uh the move stored power is a psychic (74:02 - 74:07)
type move there is not a flying type (74:06 - 74:09)
stored power there's not a dark type (74:07 - 74:11)
Storm Power (74:09 - 74:13)
they're not not a lot of Pokemon are (74:11 - 74:15)
weak to psychic so (74:13 - 74:17)
um uh (74:15 - 74:19)
so anyways that's what that video will (74:17 - 74:22)
be um I also will have a video on you (74:19 - 74:24)
know six Pokemon you can build for just (74:22 - 74:26)
five and six star raids (74:24 - 74:28)
um my video for cinderace I think still (74:26 - 74:30)
holds up pretty well as well as those (74:28 - 74:33)
builds for cinderace (74:30 - 74:35)
um if you want to do group setting I (74:33 - 74:36)
will still be doing cinderace this (74:35 - 74:37)
weekend (74:36 - 74:39)
uh this podcast goes up on the ninth so (74:37 - 74:42)
if you do need help with cinderace (74:39 - 74:45)
um just come by my twitch stream uh I'll (74:42 - 74:46)
jump into your raid I'll more than happy (74:45 - 74:48)
to help you (74:46 - 74:50)
um mod the community over at twitch (74:48 - 74:54)
which is not annoying like uh the (74:50 - 74:56)
competitive Community (74:54 - 74:59)
they are they they will uh also help you (74:56 - 75:00)
out (74:59 - 75:01)
so (75:00 - 75:02)
um we have like a lot of new people when (75:01 - 75:04)
cinderace came through and they were (75:02 - 75:07)
like oh my gosh like we got it done like (75:04 - 75:08)
everyone was so nice and so helpful so (75:07 - 75:10)
if you need that if you want to get (75:08 - 75:12)
cinderace done so you can catch it in (75:10 - 75:13)
whatever ball you want to catch it in (75:12 - 75:15)
that's cool (75:13 - 75:17)
um or if you just wanted to grind out (75:15 - 75:19)
cinderace because the rewards are fairly (75:17 - 75:21)
decent also people very much easier to (75:19 - 75:22)
grind out with people who know what (75:21 - 75:25)
they're doing versus (75:22 - 75:28)
solo I'm sure you can get it done solo (75:25 - 75:29)
over and over but it's much faster when (75:28 - 75:31)
you have three competent people standing (75:29 - 75:34)
next to you (75:31 - 75:34)
um anyway (75:34 - 75:37)
for being here Greg thank you for being (75:36 - 75:41)
here we will be back next week (75:37 - 75:43)
