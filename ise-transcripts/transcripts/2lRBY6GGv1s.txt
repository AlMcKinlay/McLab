that we can cover uh that's also a (2:40 - 2:45)
headache so we'll put that for later (2:43 - 2:47)
let's start off with the fun news this (2:45 - 2:50)
what are we gonna start with (2:47 - 2:52)
available at build-a-bear no we already (2:50 - 2:53)
covered that pokemon (2:52 - 2:56)
company settles pokemon sword and shield (2:53 - 3:00)
lawsuit that's a (2:56 - 3:04)
banger to start off with i mean (3:00 - 3:08)
did people sue over the pokedex (3:04 - 3:11)
they were uh this was the leakers they (3:08 - 3:13)
were suing leakers (3:11 - 3:16)
uh i have it off polygon.com the pokemon (3:13 - 3:17)
company has settled its (3:16 - 3:20)
november 2019 lawsuit can you believe (3:17 - 3:23)
sword and shield's almost two years old (3:20 - 3:26)
uh against two sword and shield leakers (3:23 - 3:28)
according to court documents filed on (3:26 - 3:28)
tuesday (3:28 - 3:31)
the company filed the lawsuit in 2019 (3:28 - 3:32)
after (3:31 - 3:34)
photos of an unrelease of unreleased (3:32 - 3:36)
pokemon sword and shield strategy guide (3:34 - 3:38)
were published online (3:36 - 3:39)
before the game's release date i (3:38 - 3:42)
remember looking at these pictures (3:39 - 3:43)
the defendants are required to pay the (3:42 - 3:45)
pokemon company (3:43 - 3:48)
and fifty thousand dollars each (3:45 - 3:51)
in damages and attorney fees when the (3:48 - 3:53)
pokemon company first filed the lawsuit (3:51 - 3:55)
um i thought it was nintendo that (3:53 - 3:58)
technically filed it but (3:55 - 4:00)
uh it only had screenshots of the guides (3:58 - 4:03)
posted through a discord chat (4:00 - 4:05)
throughout the lot we made sure those (4:03 - 4:07)
pictures were not in our discord chat (4:05 - 4:08)
i'll tell you that much (4:07 - 4:11)
uh throughout that the lawsuit the (4:08 - 4:12)
pokemon company discovered that one of (4:11 - 4:14)
the two defendants took the photos while (4:12 - 4:15)
employed (4:14 - 4:17)
by the company that was hired to print (4:15 - 4:18)
the strategy (4:17 - 4:21)
guide the second defendant uh then (4:18 - 4:23)
shared those photos on discord (4:21 - 4:26)
uh from where they spread to a worldwide (4:23 - 4:27)
audience (4:26 - 4:29)
the pokemon company said in the original (4:27 - 4:31)
complaint photos revealed (4:29 - 4:33)
the photos revealed features that were (4:31 - 4:34)
never before seen (4:33 - 4:36)
like gigantomax forms of certain pokemon (4:34 - 4:39)
that's true (4:36 - 4:39)
i think that's when we found out about (4:39 - 4:42)
uh hatchery (4:41 - 4:45)
for the first time yeah oh and kingler (4:42 - 4:46)
because people lost their but the (4:45 - 4:48)
kingler stuff was cool (4:46 - 4:51)
uh pokemon company said in its complaint (4:48 - 4:55)
that it reacted swiftly to the leaks (4:51 - 4:57)
including issuing takedowns across the (4:55 - 4:57)
internet (4:57 - 4:59)
these weren't the only leaks however (4:57 - 5:01)
before and after those images were (4:59 - 5:03)
online a portuguese website published a (5:01 - 5:05)
series of leaks (5:03 - 5:07)
uh that have since got blacklisted by (5:05 - 5:08)
nintendo we covered that too i (5:07 - 5:10)
completely forgot about that (5:08 - 5:13)
yeah yeah the whole website because they (5:10 - 5:14)
like (5:13 - 5:16)
gosh what was their name too they had a (5:14 - 5:18)
pretty uh (5:16 - 5:22)
we were we were obsessed with the name (5:18 - 5:25)
i look this was i don't remember yeah (5:22 - 5:28)
yeah don't ask i don't know i don't (5:25 - 5:30)
remember what we even said on last (5:28 - 5:30)
week's (5:30 - 5:33)
show (5:30 - 5:33)
anyways uh that was (5:34 - 5:41)
that's pretty much it the the two people (5:39 - 5:43)
who leaked (5:41 - 5:46)
i have to pay 150 000 i'm sure they (5:43 - 5:48)
don't have that money i'm sure (5:46 - 5:49)
what it's like the legal process you can (5:48 - 5:51)
just file for bankruptcy and then move (5:49 - 5:54)
on with life (5:51 - 5:56)
not quite (5:54 - 5:56)
possibly go to jail yeah i mean you can (5:57 - 6:03)
file for bankruptcy and (6:00 - 6:03)
they can't come after you for the money (6:04 - 6:08)
but it ruins every a lot of other things (6:06 - 6:13)
so like there's no good way around it (6:08 - 6:13)
i mean they if you really want to know (6:19 - 6:23)
they come after everything you own (6:21 - 6:24)
yeah you're forced to sell everything (6:23 - 6:27)
that you own until you can pay them back (6:24 - 6:29)
i don't i don't know the i don't know if (6:27 - 6:31)
there's any lawyers that listen to the (6:29 - 6:32)
show or (6:31 - 6:34)
i'm sure there are i know at least one (6:32 - 6:37)
lawyer that listens to this program (6:34 - 6:39)
the i'm just curious how they get to (6:37 - 6:40)
that (6:39 - 6:43)
price 150 000 like how does how is that (6:40 - 6:45)
number decided (6:43 - 6:48)
uh there are existing (6:45 - 6:51)
instruments that will tell you like (6:48 - 6:52)
based on (6:51 - 6:54)
reach and reputation damage what the (6:52 - 6:55)
financial (6:54 - 6:58)
i mean i in bringing the case (6:55 - 7:01)
to court the pokemon company's lawyers (6:58 - 7:03)
will have identified (7:01 - 7:05)
this is what we see as the amount of (7:03 - 7:07)
financial damage that was caused to us (7:05 - 7:11)
by the actions of this malfeasar (7:07 - 7:13)
that's that's part of taking something (7:11 - 7:14)
to court you don't say (7:13 - 7:16)
well they did something bad to me make (7:14 - 7:17)
them pay no (7:16 - 7:19)
you say they did something bad to me (7:17 - 7:20)
make them pay this (7:19 - 7:26)
much 2 million in damages (7:20 - 7:26)
i the the the like (7:29 - 7:35)
goal i guess also is to probably scare (7:32 - 7:36)
people (7:35 - 7:39)
not to leak these again (7:36 - 7:41)
but i feel like most people that leak (7:39 - 7:43)
are like the they won't catch me (7:41 - 7:46)
no so so it's it kind of goes along the (7:43 - 7:46)
line (7:46 - 7:50)
with uh the concept of trademark where (7:46 - 7:52)
if you don't put forth the energy to (7:50 - 7:53)
stop (7:52 - 7:55)
people from doing something then it's an (7:53 - 7:58)
indication that you do not care whether (7:55 - 7:59)
they do or do not do that thing (7:58 - 8:03)
so you do have to go after (7:59 - 8:05)
a when it hits a certain level of (8:03 - 8:06)
notability (8:05 - 8:10)
you you have to go after it yeah (8:06 - 8:12)
i mean the threat of lawsuit was had (8:10 - 8:13)
always been there right (8:12 - 8:16)
like that has always been a thing like (8:13 - 8:18)
we you know we're going to go after (8:16 - 8:20)
leakers we're going to take them down (8:18 - 8:23)
so i think this is the first time i (8:20 - 8:25)
think you know (8:23 - 8:26)
where they've actually posted the (8:25 - 8:28)
results and the amount of money (8:26 - 8:32)
and i think that's just with (8:28 - 8:33)
more notoriety i think a lot of these (8:32 - 8:36)
things would have just been in (8:33 - 8:38)
court documents and people have been (8:36 - 8:40)
like i'm sure that it got taken care of (8:38 - 8:41)
but (8:40 - 8:43)
you know it's just it was fairly big (8:41 - 8:45)
news at the time so it's big news now (8:43 - 8:46)
and (8:45 - 8:50)
they went and looked it up i i saw like (8:46 - 8:52)
one or two comments that was like i'm (8:50 - 8:54)
glad they leaked it because it prevented (8:52 - 8:55)
me from buying the game (8:54 - 8:57)
and i couldn't help think my to myself (8:55 - 8:58)
like you would have (8:57 - 9:01)
solved the game anyway yeah uh (8:58 - 9:04)
there's there's financial damages right (9:01 - 9:06)
there yeah (9:04 - 9:08)
like i don't understand the thought (9:06 - 9:10)
process like were you ready to buy the (9:08 - 9:10)
game (9:10 - 9:12)
day one without looking at it if you (9:10 - 9:13)
were already on the fence why wouldn't (9:12 - 9:14)
you just (9:13 - 9:17)
wait wait like ceremony would have had (9:14 - 9:19)
everything within three days and they (9:17 - 9:19)
did (9:19 - 9:23)
so just like wait two hours after the (9:19 - 9:24)
game came (9:23 - 9:27)
out we don't live in a culture of weight (9:24 - 9:38)
now come on (9:27 - 9:38)

will be a (11:02 - 11:07)
dragapalt prime so this is the cool (11:04 - 11:08)
thing about this set (11:07 - 11:11)
uh they're taking gimmicks from older (11:08 - 11:12)
games (11:11 - 11:15)
so prime was a gimmick in like the heart (11:12 - 11:17)
gold soul silver era there was a very (11:15 - 11:19)
popular yen mega prime that was really (11:17 - 11:21)
good so they're taking a new car a new (11:19 - 11:23)
pokemon like dragopal they're making a (11:21 - 11:24)
prime version (11:23 - 11:27)
um they're doing lance's charizard v (11:24 - 11:29)
and then dark sylveon v that's cool (11:27 - 11:31)
because gym leaders was a gimmick dark (11:29 - 11:33)

products coming out to celebrate these (11:55 - 11:59)
45 cards yet there are (11:57 - 12:01)
30 different boxes you could possibly (11:59 - 12:03)
buy maybe not buy because they're (12:01 - 12:04)
probably going to be all sold out and (12:03 - 12:05)
possible to find (12:04 - 12:09)
because there's charizards in these sets (12:05 - 12:11)
and there's pikachus in these sets and (12:09 - 12:12)
if we've learned anything (12:11 - 12:15)
in 2020 and 2021 (12:12 - 12:18)
it's that charizard and pikachu on (12:15 - 12:19)
cardboard (12:18 - 12:22)
sell very well uh (12:19 - 12:26)
it's not cardboard it's card stock (12:22 - 12:29)
my mistake oh (12:26 - 12:29)
wow wow i was there for that (12:29 - 12:39)
i was watching your stream (12:33 - 12:41)
it's like a bummer because uh i feel (12:39 - 12:43)
like (12:41 - 12:45)
the tcg has gotten better i know some (12:43 - 12:46)
people are like (12:45 - 12:48)
they still can't get tcg stuff in their (12:46 - 12:51)
area my targets in the milwaukee area (12:48 - 12:54)
remind to just don't need to bring it up (12:51 - 12:57)
every week but we were the target that (12:54 - 12:57)
had the (12:57 - 12:59)
gun pulled out and then all the carts (12:57 - 13:02)
were pulled since then (12:59 - 13:04)
that same target and the target near it (13:02 - 13:08)
has been flourishing with pokemon cards (13:04 - 13:11)
fully restocked no baseball cards (13:08 - 13:14)
uh but it was you come in you can buy (13:11 - 13:14)
two sets (13:14 - 13:17)
they had uh i took a vid i posted a (13:14 - 13:19)
video on instagram about it they had (13:17 - 13:22)
like 20 etbs of shining fates (13:19 - 13:24)
they had all the new battletons for (13:22 - 13:25)
chilling rains or (13:24 - 13:28)
sorry battle styles they had (13:25 - 13:31)
blisters and regular boosters of (13:28 - 13:33)
chilling rains they were (13:31 - 13:36)
loaded very stocked (13:33 - 13:36)
so at least targets in milwaukee have (13:37 - 13:41)
been (13:40 - 13:46)
very good with the cards and i think (13:41 - 13:46)
they will probably continue to be good (13:46 - 13:50)
until we get to celebrations where (13:48 - 13:53)
this will happen they will get although (13:50 - 13:54)
it's not (13:53 - 13:57)
like i remember when shining legends (13:54 - 13:58)
came out (13:57 - 14:01)
shining fates hidden fates like make (13:58 - 14:03)
champions path like these sets are (14:01 - 14:06)
always hard to find regardless of what (14:03 - 14:07)
they put into it because (14:06 - 14:10)
they're limited but i don't know maybe (14:07 - 14:12)
they'll learn their lesson on the print (14:10 - 14:13)
more than enough (14:12 - 14:16)
to no no no no no no not going to happen (14:13 - 14:18)
no no no (14:16 - 14:22)
no no no that's not a thing (14:18 - 14:22)
i mean so what's this what's the (14:25 - 14:31)
downside what's the sadness what's (14:28 - 14:32)
oh the sadness is cards are gonna be (14:31 - 14:35)
hard to find because of this oh (14:32 - 14:39)

bucks for the set (16:36 - 16:40)
old surumi up in surumi mansion (16:37 - 16:41)
surrounded by his (16:40 - 16:45)
pokemon valuables the so i (16:41 - 16:47)
so the the thing i wanted to collect was (16:45 - 16:49)
the (16:47 - 16:52)
was the pikachu moods yeah they sold out (16:49 - 16:53)
quick (16:52 - 16:56)
and the i got the first one which was (16:53 - 16:58)
like the sleepy mood or whatever (16:56 - 17:00)
and then the second one sold out and (16:58 - 17:01)
then this one sold out (17:00 - 17:03)
i think this is the third one the love (17:01 - 17:06)
mood yeah and i'm an all or nothing kind (17:03 - 17:08)
of person (17:06 - 17:09)

relaxing river figures (17:17 - 17:20)
though all of them right there but in a (17:18 - 17:22)
lot for sale (17:20 - 17:26)
the mood figures are resin (17:22 - 17:29)
and the relaxing river (17:26 - 17:32)
is resin and i think their resin quality (17:29 - 17:33)
is just bad (17:32 - 17:38)
it is but you can get all four of them (17:33 - 17:38)
i really want to like this nom blue polo (17:38 - 17:42)

polo shirts (18:15 - 18:19)
polo shirts have a cute collar now (18:16 - 18:21)
whether or not you pop the collar (18:19 - 18:23)

that we don't do that now we don't we (18:23 - 18:25)
don't (18:24 - 18:28)
but polo shirts are still a viable shirt (18:25 - 18:29)
option (18:28 - 18:32)
they are they are their own thing and (18:29 - 18:33)
they can dress up (18:32 - 18:36)
a simple pair of jeans for when you're (18:33 - 18:37)
going out (18:36 - 18:40)

do you know what i think is classier (21:26 - 21:33)
than a polo a turtleneck (21:28 - 21:33)
[Music] (21:33 - 21:39)
what is wrong with you this is dead (21:35 - 21:39)
hickeys only turtlenecks are for ski (21:40 - 21:46)

cool so i'm going to wear a black (21:56 - 22:00)
turtleneck and be like an uber geek (21:57 - 22:02)
there is nothing classy about a a black (22:00 - 22:04)
turtle like (22:02 - 22:06)
this the 70 the time travel police from (22:04 - 22:08)

with a dude sitting with a with a polo (22:20 - 22:22)
on (22:22 - 22:23)
and a table with a dude sitting with a (22:22 - 22:25)
turtleneck on i bet you that turtleneck (22:23 - 22:27)
guy is ten times fancier than the (22:25 - 22:29)
pokemon (22:27 - 22:31)
that guy does things in his home that we (22:29 - 22:33)
can't talk about on this car (22:31 - 22:35)

thousand years old (22:35 - 22:41)
i mean i i cannot lie i used to own (22:38 - 22:42)
turtlenecks (22:41 - 22:44)
i used to rock turtlenecks under my (22:42 - 22:45)
sweaters (22:44 - 22:48)

yes when that was appropriate or when (22:48 - 22:53)
you're out on the ski (22:51 - 22:55)
slopes having a rich day in the (22:53 - 22:56)
mountains (22:55 - 22:59)
i mean you may not understand this as a (22:56 - 23:04)
millennial will and greg but (22:59 - 23:07)
turtlenecks are not attractive they (23:04 - 23:07)
aren't (23:07 - 23:09)
turtlenecks i look at a dude wearing a (23:07 - 23:12)
turtleneck and i say (23:09 - 23:13)

them sweet clean neckline (23:28 - 23:34)
something those neck tendons you gotta (23:32 - 23:37)
expose the neck (23:34 - 23:37)
maybe we do need to do a public service (23:37 - 23:41)
announcement to our (23:39 - 23:43)
listeners who are like i'm trying to get (23:41 - 23:45)
dates and i can't get any dates and it's (23:43 - 23:46)
like hey buddy if you're wearing the (23:45 - 23:47)
turtleneck (23:46 - 23:49)
neck and you're going to arby's get get (23:47 - 23:50)

made certain amount of these and then (24:18 - 24:21)
they'll be gone forever (24:19 - 24:24)
clearly other people feel the same that (24:21 - 24:25)
i feel of these (24:24 - 24:29)
because they haven't sold out yet (24:25 - 24:33)

actual crime (25:18 - 25:21)
i was collecting so many of you you're (25:19 - 25:22)
filing for a divorce (25:21 - 25:25)

we're done uh greg are you getting the (25:43 - 25:47)
egg incubator bag (25:46 - 25:50)
so you can put a plush frazilia in it (25:47 - 25:53)
so when you walk around on go fest no (25:50 - 25:55)
people know that you got the roselia in (25:53 - 25:58)
the bag (25:55 - 26:00)
that was a very long about it there's a (25:58 - 26:01)
long thing (26:00 - 26:04)
that that should have stopped when i (26:01 - 26:04)
said no (26:04 - 26:07)
all along it and then you still went for (26:04 - 26:08)
the bad ending (26:07 - 26:11)
which is still a no i don't want to (26:08 - 26:12)
carry a bag around (26:11 - 26:14)
a plastic bag in the middle of the (26:12 - 26:16)
summer on my carrying your (26:14 - 26:19)
child it's not my child i didn't give (26:16 - 26:21)
birth to it (26:19 - 26:24)
it doesn't talk to me it's sealed i'm (26:21 - 26:25)
gonna carry yeah i'll carry (26:24 - 26:28)
a sealed plastic bag with rosalia (26:25 - 26:32)
stuck in there like some (26:28 - 26:36)
some trophy pokemon no (26:32 - 26:36)
are you are you gonna get it and stuff (26:36 - 26:41)
all of 10 foot meowth in there (26:39 - 26:42)
no because i'll probably have like a (26:41 - 26:44)
stream backpack on and that'll what if (26:42 - 26:45)
they require (26:44 - 26:48)
that oh wait that doesn't require you to (26:45 - 26:50)
have the bag (26:48 - 26:52)
no no they require that you have a clear (26:50 - 26:54)
backpack like they've done in the past (26:52 - 26:55)
i'm like but it's not going to be this (26:54 - 26:57)
year that'll be next year i mean if (26:55 - 26:57)
there's a (26:57 - 26:59)
if there was a clear backpack (26:57 - 27:01)
requirement then i'd probably get it (26:59 - 27:04)
uh okay so fifty four dollars for (27:01 - 27:07)
barbecue tool set that is not worth it (27:04 - 27:08)
okay it's clear (27:07 - 27:10)
this year if there's anything the 25 (27:08 - 27:12)
25th anniversary has proven (27:10 - 27:14)
it's that the pokemon company is out of (27:12 - 27:15)
ideas (27:14 - 27:18)
another company that has a catalog of (27:15 - 27:19)
items (27:18 - 27:21)
and they flip through said catalog and (27:19 - 27:23)
they point at things and they say put (27:21 - 27:24)
pikachu on it and then we put it up on (27:23 - 27:26)
the website (27:24 - 27:28)
case in point this grill collection (27:26 - 27:29)
which (27:28 - 27:33)
is like look i ca they got like five (27:29 - 27:34)
pictures on the website it's kind of (27:33 - 27:35)
hard to gauge (27:34 - 27:39)
but it looks like so they they have a (27:35 - 27:42)
they have a the a porker the two prong (27:39 - 27:42)
thing (27:42 - 27:44)
i don't know what to call i don't call (27:42 - 27:46)
it a porker (27:44 - 27:46)
yeah it's like a big fork it's a (27:46 - 27:49)
grilling fork but where do you get (27:48 - 27:51)
porker from because you could like (27:49 - 27:55)
pork you pork pork pork (27:51 - 27:58)
it has just it it is like the standard (27:55 - 28:00)
thing you would probably find at walmart (27:58 - 28:01)
for 20 bucks (28:00 - 28:05)
yeah and they just put a very small (28:01 - 28:08)
stencil pikachu on the on the bottom yes (28:05 - 28:11)
and then they got the tongs and then (28:08 - 28:11)
they got the (28:11 - 28:18)
uh spatulas the tongs (28:11 - 28:18)
no the most important thing is the apron (28:29 - 28:36)
that's that's what all the polka dads (28:32 - 28:39)
are out to get but it's not in the set (28:36 - 28:39)
it says (28:39 - 28:42)
pokemon summer days grilling apron it's (28:39 - 28:44)
just a different item (28:42 - 28:47)
the airport's like 35 bucks on its own (28:44 - 28:48)
just get the apron (28:47 - 28:52)
i got look i i want to buy (28:48 - 28:54)
useless i want to buy a pikachu butter (28:52 - 28:56)
dish i want (28:54 - 28:59)
to buy things like this but i feel like (28:56 - 28:59)
the (28:59 - 29:03)
summer day grilling set three pack (28:59 - 29:06)
for almost sixty dollars (29:03 - 29:06)
there wasn't a lot of thought put into (29:07 - 29:10)
that here's the problem (29:08 - 29:11)
i want to believe it's good quality do (29:10 - 29:13)
we do we know what date that this was (29:11 - 29:14)
added (29:13 - 29:17)
to it was added on tuesday yeah okay so (29:14 - 29:19)
they obviously missed the mark because (29:17 - 29:21)
there are three things that exist in (29:19 - 29:22)
this world (29:21 - 29:27)
dads who like to grill (29:22 - 29:28)
and children who don't know what to get (29:27 - 29:30)
their father for father's day yes (29:28 - 29:32)
i mean dads who like pokemon who like to (29:30 - 29:34)
grill and children who don't know what (29:32 - 29:36)
to get their father for father's day (29:34 - 29:38)
this would have been the perfect if i (29:36 - 29:40)
had made the mistake and had children i (29:38 - 29:41)
would have probably gotten this if you (29:40 - 29:44)
if you are serious about grilling you (29:41 - 29:45)
probably (29:44 - 29:48)
have like 80 dollar tongs that have you (29:45 - 29:51)
significantly better of the united (29:48 - 29:54)
states of america (29:51 - 29:56)
this is uh for for our worldwide (29:54 - 29:57)
listeners (29:56 - 30:00)
welcome to folks from india to (29:57 - 30:04)
saskatchewan for america and (30:00 - 30:10)
it is men men enjoy grilling (30:04 - 30:13)
with zero skill but they are adamant (30:10 - 30:16)
that they are going to grill (30:13 - 30:19)
so no no one is a grilling enthusiast (30:16 - 30:20)
and investing heavily in (30:19 - 30:24)
the except for the the actual what is (30:20 - 30:24)
that (30:24 - 30:26)
machine that you cook on the actual (30:24 - 30:27)
grill grill (30:26 - 30:31)
the grill the grill they will spend like (30:27 - 30:34)
ten thousand dollars yeah just so that (30:31 - 30:35)
they have a better (30:34 - 30:38)
grill than their buddy but the actual (30:35 - 30:39)
tongs (30:38 - 30:41)
no no no no i went to home depot got two (30:39 - 30:43)
pieces of metal and put a spring between (30:41 - 30:44)
them (30:43 - 30:45)
that shows you what kind of a man i am (30:44 - 30:48)
right there i made my own tongs (30:45 - 30:50)
this is this is a set that you put into (30:48 - 30:51)
a frame (30:50 - 30:53)
and hang on the wall and never dirty (30:51 - 30:55)
them (30:53 - 30:55)
i can't wait for all the angry grill (30:59 - 31:04)
enthusiast letters (31:01 - 31:07)
we skipping the fact that it looks like (31:04 - 31:07)
at the end (31:07 - 31:11)
of both the spatula and the grilling (31:07 - 31:12)
fork (31:11 - 31:15)
that looks like a bottle opener i think (31:12 - 31:15)
it (31:15 - 31:17)
maybe but i thought it was just a hang (31:15 - 31:19)
them up on the side of the grill (31:17 - 31:21)
i mean but they could probably open (31:19 - 31:23)
bottles they got that lip for the bottle (31:21 - 31:25)
opener right there they got that lip in (31:23 - 31:25)
them (31:25 - 31:27)
i i'm sure by the end of the year we'll (31:25 - 31:29)
figure out exactly what catalog they're (31:27 - 31:29)
open (31:29 - 31:32)
they're ordering from oh yeah this is (31:29 - 31:33)
the (31:32 - 31:35)
same catalog harley davidson is using (31:33 - 31:37)
same exact spatula said it's just (31:35 - 31:39)
that they threw the harley logo on the (31:37 - 31:42)
bottom brandedcontent.com (31:39 - 31:44)
for all your branded content needs i (31:42 - 31:46)
don't know what factory in (31:44 - 31:48)
india i'm almost positive the resin (31:46 - 31:50)
figures are being made in india (31:48 - 31:52)
uh i think i think that's what that's (31:50 - 31:54)
china in their thing (31:52 - 31:58)
yeah but when i got um (31:54 - 32:01)
when i got the sleepy one (31:58 - 32:03)
there i and then i think the pikachu (32:01 - 32:05)
salt and pepper shaker i think they say (32:03 - 32:10)
um india on the boxes (32:05 - 32:10)
so there's lies on this website (32:11 - 32:18)
could be manufactured in china packaged (32:15 - 32:19)
in india this could be (32:18 - 32:21)
something that can happen i'm just not (32:19 - 32:23)
sold on any of their resin figures maybe (32:21 - 32:24)
they need a different (32:23 - 32:29)
factory or quality control a better (32:24 - 32:33)
resin scientist yes (32:29 - 32:36)

happened in the world of pokemon go (34:40 - 34:44)
before so we're just as puzzled as you (34:42 - 34:46)

you up to eight (36:30 - 36:34)
remote raid passes and then there will (36:31 - 36:35)
be a bundle that will contain (36:34 - 36:37)
three remote raid passes that will be (36:35 - 36:40)
available in the shop that day as well (36:37 - 36:42)
and (36:40 - 36:42)
tickets available now so (36:44 - 36:49)
they don't really mention are the ones (36:47 - 36:51)
that have previously been shiny can they (36:49 - 36:53)
still be shiny in this event or is it a (36:51 - 36:55)
non-shiny event (36:53 - 36:57)
i would assume that they wouldn't turn (36:55 - 36:58)
off shinies (36:57 - 37:00)
yeah i would assume the same shinyan is (36:58 - 37:02)
shining on (37:00 - 37:04)
yeah but we have been in shiny off times (37:02 - 37:07)
before (37:04 - 37:09)
usually accidents yeah but they don't (37:07 - 37:11)
specifically say which makes me (37:09 - 37:14)
concerned although the problem (37:11 - 37:17)
i guess okay so people (37:14 - 37:17)
people really want shiny dialga and (37:18 - 37:24)
palkia (37:21 - 37:25)
so you could maybe be like are they (37:24 - 37:28)
going to turn those shiny (37:25 - 37:30)
i feel like zekrom and xerneas and (37:28 - 37:31)
evital and (37:30 - 37:34)
the other one resharam those are (37:31 - 37:37)
still like too new but i guess i could (37:34 - 37:39)
turn those shiny as well (37:37 - 37:42)
i mean whatever maybe they'll do (37:39 - 37:43)
whatever they want (37:42 - 37:45)
you're in a weird situation because like (37:43 - 37:47)
whether or not they turn on chinese if (37:45 - 37:48)
you're at like (37:47 - 37:50)
mall of america let's just say we're at (37:48 - 37:52)
mall of america there's seven gyms (37:50 - 37:56)
and rush around pops and it can't be (37:52 - 37:57)
shiny (37:56 - 37:59)
what are you gonna do are you gonna be (37:57 - 38:00)
like i'm not gonna do this raid that i (37:59 - 38:02)
can access at any point in this mall and (38:00 - 38:03)
just ignore it (38:02 - 38:07)
or yeah you're just gonna like (38:03 - 38:09)
wait 30 minutes for it to despawn and (38:07 - 38:10)
for the next one to pop (38:09 - 38:12)
up well i mean hopefully the uh there (38:10 - 38:13)
the other ones that you want are at the (38:12 - 38:15)
other gyms right so like you can pick (38:13 - 38:18)
and choose which ones you're going for (38:15 - 38:22)
yeah but there there's going to be (38:18 - 38:24)
like let's let's the dichotomy of (38:22 - 38:27)
pokemon go trainers there's (38:24 - 38:30)
so so when the they announced this i i (38:27 - 38:32)
the first thing i thought of was (38:30 - 38:35)
my sister who um (38:32 - 38:37)
she's like level 32 or whatever she's (38:35 - 38:39)
been playing since day one (38:37 - 38:42)
she plays with her kids a lot she never (38:39 - 38:43)
does community days (38:42 - 38:44)
she never does like these events like b (38:43 - 38:46)
doof but she will always (38:44 - 38:50)
do like a go fest or like a big ticketed (38:46 - 38:52)
event (38:50 - 38:56)
and i remember last year (38:52 - 38:58)
her biggest disappointment with go fest (38:56 - 39:00)
was she didn't get enough (38:58 - 39:02)
legendary pokemon and the year before (39:00 - 39:06)
that she was disappointed with day one (39:02 - 39:09)
because she was hoping she would get a (39:06 - 39:11)
legendary pokemon which the legendary (39:09 - 39:12)
pokemon for gofest were (39:11 - 39:14)
saved for day two that was like the (39:12 - 39:15)
shadow lugia (39:14 - 39:17)
shadow moltres zapdos articuno and the (39:15 - 39:19)
mewtwo um (39:17 - 39:21)
or was that all last year i don't (39:19 - 39:24)
remember one of those last year (39:21 - 39:24)
but once she got the legend she was like (39:24 - 39:28)
happy (39:27 - 39:30)
because she doesn't have a lot of people (39:28 - 39:31)
to raid with so (39:30 - 39:35)
doing these events like and getting (39:31 - 39:38)
legendary pokemon are excited for her (39:35 - 39:40)
exciting for her so i would imagine that (39:38 - 39:42)
if somebody just started playing go (39:40 - 39:42)
during (39:42 - 39:45)
the pandemic or somebody you know hasn't (39:42 - 39:47)
been playing go since day one (39:45 - 39:49)
this is a great opportunity for them to (39:47 - 39:51)
get a lot of pokemon that they are (39:49 - 39:52)
missing (39:51 - 39:55)
because like us three we probably (39:52 - 39:58)
we probably got like reggie rock regis (39:55 - 40:00)
and reggie steele the first time (39:58 - 40:01)
and then when they came back the second (40:00 - 40:04)
time we were like oh we don't care (40:01 - 40:07)
and then they came back as shiny and i (40:04 - 40:09)
wanted the shiny (40:07 - 40:11)
you guys didn't care no and then now (40:09 - 40:12)
they're coming back again for this event (40:11 - 40:15)
but i don't like i don't care right i (40:12 - 40:16)
already have enough of them and i (40:15 - 40:18)
already have them as shiny (40:16 - 40:20)
so i feel like they're the you have a (40:18 - 40:21)
lot of people (40:20 - 40:23)
being vocal being like ugh i already (40:21 - 40:25)
have a lot of these but yeah you (40:23 - 40:27)
correct you do correct you've been (40:25 - 40:30)
playing for five years of course you do (40:27 - 40:32)
uh (40:30 - 40:32)
but i would assume (40:33 - 40:36)
that niantic and pokemon are not dumb (40:37 - 40:42)
and the majority of players do not have (40:40 - 40:45)
every single legend (40:42 - 40:47)
and for five dollars you get access to (40:45 - 40:49)
this event (40:47 - 40:50)
they make a big deal about it they force (40:49 - 40:52)
everyone to play it's going to be very (40:50 - 40:53)
easy to get these legends (40:52 - 40:57)
everyone to play yep well you could be (40:53 - 40:58)
like will and spend the money and not (40:57 - 40:58)
play (40:58 - 41:02)
yeah yeah correct so i i think (40:58 - 41:04)
event wise i think it's a good event i (41:02 - 41:06)
think it's a good event i mean (41:04 - 41:08)
it's a five-year catch-up let's do (41:06 - 41:09)
everything (41:08 - 41:12)
event right like it's uh everything is (41:09 - 41:12)
back (41:12 - 41:14)
it's a new players and old players it's (41:12 - 41:17)
a nostalgia for pokemon go which is (41:14 - 41:19)
weird to say but it is five years so (41:17 - 41:22)
whatever i (41:19 - 41:22)
it boggles my mind (41:22 - 41:28)
to some extent when people who have (41:26 - 41:30)
played the game (41:28 - 41:34)
for years are upset (41:30 - 41:37)
that events come back well (41:34 - 41:39)
i actually look at it a little (41:37 - 41:41)
differently i look at it (41:39 - 41:45)
at this as uh pokemon go saying (41:41 - 41:48)
hey buddy you know how you give up every (41:45 - 41:51)
whatever tuesday night how you take off (41:48 - 41:53)
time from work (41:51 - 41:54)
and you're so obsessed and like on (41:53 - 41:56)
tuesday nights you drive around to (41:54 - 41:57)
literally (41:56 - 42:00)
30 raids within the raid hour so that (41:57 - 42:02)
you can do absolutely every single one (42:00 - 42:03)
so (42:02 - 42:05)
not only can you get the shiny but you (42:03 - 42:07)
can get the shiny with the highest (42:05 - 42:10)
stats and everything they're like dude (42:07 - 42:13)
chill chill this is your time to relax (42:10 - 42:14)
you've been (42:13 - 42:16)
you've but no no no like there it's like (42:14 - 42:18)
we are casting judgment on how you have (42:16 - 42:20)
been playing this game (42:18 - 42:24)
we did not intend for you to be so (42:20 - 42:27)
obsessed you should relax because guess (42:24 - 42:28)
what (42:27 - 42:30)
we always bring it back around we always (42:28 - 42:32)
bring it back always bring it back (42:30 - 42:33)
around (42:32 - 42:36)
so you didn't need to give up so much of (42:33 - 42:37)
your life (42:36 - 42:40)
for this so you have a player like my (42:37 - 42:40)
sister (42:40 - 42:42)
which is probably a lot of people you (42:40 - 42:44)
know they're missing legendary pokemon (42:42 - 42:45)
they don't get to do raids that often (42:44 - 42:47)
they do do these big events (42:45 - 42:49)
they will probably do they will probably (42:47 - 42:51)
focus on the ones they're missing (42:49 - 42:54)
to fill out their pokedex um then you (42:51 - 42:56)
have like the battler (42:54 - 42:59)
people who they need a good restaurant (42:56 - 43:01)
they need to do the good zekrom (42:59 - 43:04)
they they will ignore every reggie rock (43:01 - 43:06)
and he well he trends actually pretty (43:04 - 43:07)
okay verizion (43:06 - 43:09)
they will ignore those because they're (43:07 - 43:10)
looking for whatever for go battle (43:09 - 43:11)
league or (43:10 - 43:14)
for raid carries and then i feel like (43:11 - 43:18)
you have players like me (43:14 - 43:20)
which unfortunately that turns into greg (43:18 - 43:21)
and will where (43:20 - 43:24)
oh we're doing every one that we can (43:21 - 43:25)
because we're already (43:24 - 43:27)
here yeah so we're going to make the (43:25 - 43:29)
most of our time (43:27 - 43:31)
we've already we've already sunk the (43:29 - 43:32)
five dollars in (43:31 - 43:34)
and we've all we already bought raid (43:32 - 43:36)
passes (43:34 - 43:38)
so we might as well instead of waiting (43:36 - 43:40)
for the next 30 minutes we might (43:38 - 43:42)
as well just do this one yeah hatred (43:40 - 43:44)
better be okay your entire bachelor (43:42 - 43:45)
party was a lie (43:44 - 43:48)
yeah yeah (43:45 - 43:48)
i think it's cool the the i mean the (43:50 - 43:55)
problem is like (43:53 - 43:57)
your location are you in an area that (43:55 - 43:58)
has (43:57 - 44:01)
10 raids and if you're not in an area (43:58 - 44:02)
that has 10 raids (44:01 - 44:05)
do you have access to a discord or (44:02 - 44:08)
unfortunately a facebook group where (44:05 - 44:09)
your (44:08 - 44:12)
other people can say look i got the (44:09 - 44:13)
giratina (44:12 - 44:14)
and you're like oh thank goodness i only (44:13 - 44:17)
got uh thundurus over here (44:14 - 44:23)
and you can join in it also (44:17 - 44:27)
like seems (44:23 - 44:29)
i i did i did ask niantic this and they (44:27 - 44:30)
said (44:29 - 44:32)
further details will be revealed which (44:30 - 44:33)
the further details (44:32 - 44:35)
are you get all these raid passes (44:33 - 44:37)
because my thought process (44:35 - 44:40)
is well if you are (44:37 - 44:42)
charging five dollars for an event and (44:40 - 44:45)
you're saying day two of the event (44:42 - 44:48)
is raid focused (44:45 - 44:49)
[Music] (44:48 - 44:52)
how do you want your players to play the (44:49 - 44:55)
eight-hour event for raids when raids (44:52 - 44:55)
cost (44:55 - 44:59)
money they want you to spend money on (44:55 - 44:59)
rate (44:59 - 45:02)
classes like how do you envision that (44:59 - 45:03)
working (45:02 - 45:05)
and they're they're they said well we'll (45:03 - 45:07)
get free raid passes we'll talk about (45:05 - 45:09)
that at a later date here's that later (45:07 - 45:10)
date so 10 (45:09 - 45:12)
local raid passes plus technically (45:10 - 45:15)
you're one free one so 11. (45:12 - 45:17)
eight remote raid and three more remote (45:15 - 45:18)
raids so that's (45:17 - 45:22)
22 raid passes (45:18 - 45:22)
in eight hours i i guess that's like (45:23 - 45:30)
probably what maybe normal people (45:26 - 45:33)
that's great yeah i'm trying to think of (45:30 - 45:35)
like raid trains (45:33 - 45:36)
when they do like the wednesday night (45:35 - 45:38)
thing where they boost it (45:36 - 45:40)
and i feel like if you have a really (45:38 - 45:42)
good group you could probably do (45:40 - 45:45)
like 10 of them feel like a slow group (45:42 - 45:46)
you maybe do like (45:45 - 45:50)
six yeah but that's in one hour (45:46 - 45:52)
yeah oh i okay i was thinking of more (45:50 - 45:54)
like the (45:52 - 45:57)
when we used to do the um (45:54 - 45:57)
like the saturdays and they would have (45:58 - 46:01)
like the (46:01 - 46:04)
they did the canton and everything (46:01 - 46:06)
and like those raid trains would be (46:04 - 46:08)
doing 30 or 40. (46:06 - 46:10)
because they they go in you start the (46:08 - 46:12)
raid you start walking towards the next (46:10 - 46:14)
one you don't want these (46:12 - 46:19)
yeah yeah but in the sense of like (46:14 - 46:21)
needing to remote in that that is just (46:19 - 46:22)
more time consuming (46:21 - 46:25)
you can't like when you're in person and (46:22 - 46:26)
you're doing a ray train (46:25 - 46:29)
and you have like 20 of you and you all (46:26 - 46:30)
jump in and then you start doing it then (46:29 - 46:32)
you start walking to the next one (46:30 - 46:33)
it's very easy to coordinate yeah so (46:32 - 46:35)
that's why you can do so many (46:33 - 46:38)
but you can't use remote rate classes (46:35 - 46:39)
locally (46:38 - 46:43)
uh yeah can you yeah yeah there's a (46:39 - 46:45)
gym down the street from my house and if (46:43 - 46:46)
i see something good in there (46:45 - 46:49)
i it's too far for me to be a local yeah (46:46 - 46:50)
but if you are (46:49 - 46:52)
if you are like if we're in mall of (46:50 - 46:54)
america and we are standing next to the (46:52 - 46:55)
thing (46:54 - 46:58)
can you choose to use a remote raid pass (46:55 - 47:00)
instead of a regular raid pass (46:58 - 47:01)
oh no i think you have to be out of the (47:00 - 47:04)
circle so really (47:01 - 47:05)
well then you just walk to the other (47:04 - 47:08)
side of the wall yeah you just walk yeah (47:05 - 47:13)
make them all remote i (47:08 - 47:15)
i would assume for like a normal person (47:13 - 47:17)
20 some raid passes is enough because (47:15 - 47:18)
i'm also assuming that person is (47:17 - 47:19)
probably not going to play (47:18 - 47:23)
all eight hours right and if they are (47:19 - 47:24)
going to play all eight hours they (47:23 - 47:26)
probably have no problem spending more (47:24 - 47:27)
money (47:26 - 47:29)
they might complain about spending more (47:27 - 47:31)
money but look it's the big event (47:29 - 47:33)
the one big event of the year for this (47:31 - 47:35)
game that you're so obsessed with (47:33 - 47:38)
save save up a little bit to splurge on (47:35 - 47:39)
the go fast (47:38 - 47:41)
i'm just trying to lay out what that day (47:39 - 47:43)
looks like for both sides (47:41 - 47:46)
of like casual and hardcore (47:43 - 47:49)
uh like for me i would i for me though (47:46 - 47:51)
my thought process is like i don't care (47:49 - 47:53)
about regis i don't care about lugia i (47:51 - 47:54)
don't care about entei i don't care (47:53 - 47:56)
about suicune like (47:54 - 47:59)
i do want to do palkias and kirums and (47:56 - 48:03)
reshrams but again we're going to be at (47:59 - 48:04)
a place (48:03 - 48:07)
with seven gems (48:04 - 48:08)
and i'm sure and at least during the (48:07 - 48:10)
canto tour they were also they were (48:08 - 48:11)
spawning for like 15 minutes and then (48:10 - 48:14)
rotating out (48:11 - 48:19)
so i so if all the gyms are (48:14 - 48:23)
regis i guess i could do the regis but i (48:19 - 48:25)
don't want to but then do i just wait (48:23 - 48:29)
15 minutes it's not like we can't fill (48:25 - 48:32)
time yeah i know i know it's just it's (48:29 - 48:34)
like i don't think i have a virizion so (48:32 - 48:35)
there's some of the ones that i just (48:34 - 48:38)
don't oh i certainly have none of these (48:35 - 48:40)
except articuno which they gave me for (48:38 - 48:43)
free i think (48:40 - 48:43)
okay yeah it's it's it will be an (48:44 - 48:49)
interesting event and just started (48:47 - 48:51)
coordinating what everybody (48:49 - 48:55)
wants and needs to get from it (48:51 - 48:55)
oh and can we also remind folks it's the (48:55 - 48:58)
opposite of (48:57 - 49:01)
our previous uh scold warning and (48:58 - 49:02)
annotation (49:01 - 49:06)

in game if you click on like a team (51:17 - 51:19)
instinct (51:18 - 51:21)
it's like yellow with these black slashy (51:19 - 51:24)
lines and then if it's mystic it's blue (51:21 - 51:27)
wait when did these um these special (51:24 - 51:30)
whatever achievement when did that start (51:27 - 51:31)
did that start already (51:30 - 51:32)
yeah it started on like thursday night (51:31 - 51:34)
okay because i was doing (51:32 - 51:37)
uh raid this morning don't ask me why it (51:34 - 51:37)
just (51:37 - 51:39)
happened it it happened sometimes i was (51:37 - 51:41)
doing it alone (51:39 - 51:43)
and when i finished killing that poor (51:41 - 51:46)
little timber (51:43 - 51:48)
i got a pop-up on my screen that said (51:46 - 51:49)
you (51:48 - 51:52)
dealt the last blow yeah i was like (51:49 - 51:56)
i also dealt the only blows what are you (51:52 - 51:57)
trying to tell me here (51:56 - 51:59)
was that was that one of these things (51:57 - 52:01)
yes okay (51:59 - 52:03)
this this is gonna be my psa for this (52:01 - 52:05)
because i saw (52:03 - 52:08)
some you know rumblings and and (52:05 - 52:10)
you know i'm on twitch a lot so i hear (52:08 - 52:12)
people's you know first impressions when (52:10 - 52:13)
they when these youtubers (52:12 - 52:16)
watch a lot i'm on twitch a lot and i (52:13 - 52:16)
think (52:16 - 52:18)
i think i i saw this in our slack in our (52:16 - 52:20)
discord of people (52:18 - 52:24)
maybe expressing their concerns of uh (52:20 - 52:26)
using the tallest pokemon in battle you (52:24 - 52:28)
know people might bring exeggutors just (52:26 - 52:28)
to get this (52:28 - 52:32)
or keeping a single pokemon longest in (52:28 - 52:34)
battle people might bring blissey to get (52:32 - 52:35)
this (52:34 - 52:38)
and that would encourage bad pokemon (52:35 - 52:40)
being brought to raids (52:38 - 52:42)
this is what i will say if those people (52:40 - 52:44)
really want those achievements (52:42 - 52:47)
let them have those achievements they (52:44 - 52:47)
are (52:47 - 52:50)
they they mean nothing (52:47 - 52:53)
and that's what that and that's fine (52:50 - 52:54)
it's like the sticker complaint where (52:53 - 52:55)
people are like (52:54 - 52:57)
these stickers are so useless what am i (52:55 - 52:59)
supposed to do with them (52:57 - 53:02)
nothing they're just fun have you ever (52:59 - 53:04)
received an actual postcard in the mail (53:02 - 53:05)
and somebody slapped a sticker on it and (53:04 - 53:06)
you're like (53:05 - 53:08)
why did they stack slap a sticker on it (53:06 - 53:10)
because they're trying to make an (53:08 - 53:12)
enjoyable thing that means nothing (53:10 - 53:13)
you'll look at it for one day and then (53:12 - 53:14)
you'll throw it in the trash (53:13 - 53:17)
and then you'll never these are just fun (53:14 - 53:17)
things (53:17 - 53:19)
if somebody at the end of the raid goes (53:17 - 53:22)
wow my pokemon was the tallest (53:19 - 53:23)
they're not going to remember it in 10 (53:22 - 53:25)
minutes it's whatever it's just a fun (53:23 - 53:28)
dumb thing and if somebody really wants (53:25 - 53:30)
to always have the tallest pokemon (53:28 - 53:34)
amongst everyone in battle let them have (53:30 - 53:34)
it (53:34 - 53:37)
it's fine it doesn't mean anything your (53:34 - 53:37)
raid (53:37 - 53:39)
might take five seconds longer because (53:37 - 53:41)
they're using a lowland executor (53:39 - 53:44)
or you may fail it's true you might fail (53:41 - 53:46)
it well if you fail it then they don't (53:44 - 53:47)
get the prize (53:46 - 53:49)
that's true so eventually everyone will (53:47 - 53:50)
learn their lesson yeah (53:49 - 53:52)
i i think it's fine though i i (53:50 - 53:54)
definitely (53:52 - 53:57)
there there has been games where at the (53:54 - 53:59)
end of the game (53:57 - 54:00)
uh monster hunter did this i think was (53:59 - 54:02)
monster hunter generations will (54:00 - 54:05)
where at the end of the hunt it would be (54:02 - 54:06)
like oh (54:05 - 54:07)
monster hunter world that was not (54:06 - 54:09)
generation oh it was world it was like (54:07 - 54:10)
oh you were the (54:09 - 54:13)
mount master or you you did the most you (54:10 - 54:14)
did the most damage (54:13 - 54:17)
or you did the most uh grapple (54:14 - 54:20)
king or like assist heels that kind of (54:17 - 54:20)
thing (54:20 - 54:24)
yeah but like no when i was when i was (54:20 - 54:26)
doing those hunts i never thought to (54:24 - 54:26)
myself (54:26 - 54:28)
oh i really need to be the the grap lock (54:26 - 54:29)
master (54:28 - 54:32)
like i just you just happen to get that (54:29 - 54:34)
at the end and you're like oh i guess i (54:32 - 54:35)
did grapple the most (54:34 - 54:37)
like it's just like a fun thing that (54:35 - 54:39)
popped up that you didn't really think (54:37 - 54:40)
about (54:39 - 54:42)
once you realize that all achievements (54:40 - 54:43)
are worthless (54:42 - 54:45)
you can just let it go and not care (54:43 - 54:47)
right i mean i don't think anyone is (54:45 - 54:48)
being like well i got (54:47 - 54:50)
16 platinum trophies on the playstation (54:48 - 54:52)
network and then like quickly updating (54:50 - 54:54)
their linkedin to be like i mean (54:52 - 54:57)

know i'm trying to get sony to sponsor (54:58 - 55:00)
you greg (55:00 - 55:02)
the achievement of peace in your heart (55:00 - 55:04)
through quiet contemplation and (55:02 - 55:05)
meditation (55:04 - 55:08)
is a true great reward so not all (55:05 - 55:09)
achievements are worthless (55:08 - 55:12)

uh i do know some barbecue places we'll (55:47 - 55:52)
we'll discuss it we'll figure it out (55:50 - 55:54)
okay last one is the (55:52 - 55:57)
drama here uh (55:54 - 55:59)
this says trainers one of the delights (55:57 - 56:01)
of pokemon go is finding pokemon in the (55:59 - 56:02)
real world (56:01 - 56:03)
walking around discovering new places (56:02 - 56:05)
meeting up with groups of friends (56:03 - 56:07)
yeah like you guys were just planning i (56:05 - 56:09)
have been saying this since day one (56:07 - 56:11)
even before the game came out i remember (56:09 - 56:13)
myself saying it's pokemon in the real (56:11 - 56:14)
world steve (56:13 - 56:18)
stop hating on it yeah steve uh at the (56:14 - 56:20)
core niantic built the game around these (56:18 - 56:22)
ideals of exploration exercise and (56:20 - 56:24)
playing with friends (56:22 - 56:27)
as we said last month they bolded said (56:24 - 56:31)
uh which is weird how we all play has (56:27 - 56:34)
changed a lot in the past 15 months (56:31 - 56:36)
with uh the onset of the global pandemic (56:34 - 56:37)
we realized that we had (56:36 - 56:39)
to change the model for our game we (56:37 - 56:40)
could no longer take (56:39 - 56:42)
going outside and meeting people for (56:40 - 56:43)
granted we've learned a lot thank you (56:42 - 56:45)
for coming along as we navigate through (56:43 - 56:46)
this together (56:45 - 56:48)
today we will be moving towards recovery (56:46 - 56:50)
and we are announcing (56:48 - 56:53)
new exclu exploration bonuses that make (56:50 - 56:56)
it rewarding to play outside (56:53 - 56:58)
are coming over the next several months (56:56 - 57:00)
including bonuses for spinning spots (56:58 - 57:02)
playing in person raids and getting in (57:00 - 57:04)
those steps (57:02 - 57:06)
bonuses introduced last year we plan to (57:04 - 57:08)
change or remove (57:06 - 57:10)
and we will be first testing in the us (57:08 - 57:12)
and new zealand followed by other (57:10 - 57:12)
countries (57:12 - 57:16)
based on local conditions and they (57:12 - 57:18)
then said bonuses introduced last year (57:16 - 57:20)
we plan on keeping including first catch (57:18 - 57:20)
of the day (57:20 - 57:22)
go battle league and train our battle (57:20 - 57:24)
requirements (57:22 - 57:27)
we will only remove these bonuses after (57:24 - 57:29)
go fest 2021 (57:27 - 57:30)
starting in the united states and new (57:29 - 57:32)
zealand we wanted to give you advance (57:30 - 57:33)
heads up of what's coming (57:32 - 57:36)
and our thinking behind it as we said (57:33 - 57:37)
last november they bolded (57:36 - 57:39)
the word set again it's because it's a (57:37 - 57:40)
link to (57:39 - 57:43)
their updates which is just like so it's (57:40 - 57:44)
so passive aggressive (57:43 - 57:46)
whatever yeah but the problem is if they (57:44 - 57:48)
don't do it people will be like you lied (57:46 - 57:49)
and they're like no we didn't we said (57:48 - 57:51)
specifically here (57:49 - 57:54)
uh we are committed to doing this in a (57:51 - 57:55)
staggered way (57:54 - 57:57)
uh that makes sense for each place in (57:55 - 57:59)
the world to help people safely and then (57:57 - 58:01)
to return outside again these changes (57:59 - 58:01)
are aimed at (58:01 - 58:04)
the focus of pokemon go on movement and (58:01 - 58:05)
exploration in the real world (58:04 - 58:07)
these changes will slowly be introduced (58:05 - 58:08)
and carefully (58:07 - 58:11)
making it more uh make and more exciting (58:08 - 58:12)
to explore the world around you blah (58:11 - 58:14)
blah there's a lot fluff here (58:12 - 58:15)
okay new bonuses for playing in the real (58:14 - 58:17)
world (58:15 - 58:19)
there's a three-part step uh these will (58:17 - 58:21)
be first in the u.s and new zealand you (58:19 - 58:23)
will receive up to two free raid passes (58:21 - 58:25)
a day (58:23 - 58:27)
seems good it's a hundred percent more (58:25 - 58:29)
raid passes (58:27 - 58:33)
the benefit from increased incense (58:29 - 58:36)
effectiveness while moving around (58:33 - 58:38)
that makes sense incense should work (58:36 - 58:40)
better if you're moving (58:38 - 58:44)
in my opinion be guaranteed gifts when (58:40 - 58:46)
spinning a pokestop as long as you don't (58:44 - 58:48)
have maximum gifts in your inventory (58:46 - 58:49)
also good (58:48 - 58:50)
especially since i feel like people (58:49 - 58:53)
complained that it was hard to get gifts (58:50 - 58:55)
so they're saying if you have 19 gifts (58:53 - 58:57)
you spend that stop you're guaranteed (58:55 - 58:59)
that gift to get you to 20. (58:57 - 59:00)
and you will receive 10 times the bonus (58:59 - 59:02)
xp for spinning a pokestop the first (59:00 - 59:03)
time (59:02 - 59:05)
no i don't really care about that but (59:03 - 59:07)
whatever (59:05 - 59:10)
um bonuses introduced (59:07 - 59:12)
last year that we plan to remove or (59:10 - 59:13)
change (59:12 - 59:16)
uh over the last year these so the (59:13 - 59:17)
bonuses that they said here (59:16 - 59:21)
will end september 1. (59:17 - 59:24)
yes so they want they said i think they (59:21 - 59:25)
say this maybe at the end (59:24 - 59:28)
that they want bonuses to rotate out per (59:25 - 59:29)
season (59:28 - 59:32)
so just like seasons have the like for (59:29 - 59:33)
the seasons of legends you got (59:32 - 59:36)
bonus xp for doing raids and (59:33 - 59:39)
the one season there was something i (59:36 - 59:42)
don't remember what it was (59:39 - 59:42)
uh so they they do want to they said (59:42 - 59:47)
some bonuses they'll tweak some bonuses (59:45 - 59:49)
they'll change some bonuses won't go (59:47 - 59:52)
away new bonuses will come in (59:49 - 59:54)
bonuses we introduced last year that we (59:52 - 59:56)
plan to remove or change okay (59:54 - 59:59)
over the past year incense effectiveness (59:56 - 60:01)
was increased to attract pokemon to you (59:59 - 60:03)
more frequently even if you weren't able (60:01 - 60:04)
to leave at home (60:03 - 60:05)
after the change the effectiveness will (60:04 - 60:07)
be set at (60:05 - 60:08)
the standard level when you're (60:07 - 60:10)
stationary and increase (60:08 - 60:13)
effectiveness will kick in when you're (60:10 - 60:15)
moving (60:13 - 60:17)
we'll come back to that previously your (60:15 - 60:19)
buddy will bring you more gifts each day (60:17 - 60:22)
up to five gifts at once up to three (60:19 - 60:23)
times a day this was because we knew (60:22 - 60:24)
trainers were (60:23 - 60:26)
running low on supplies like pokeballs (60:24 - 60:28)
and berries to catch pokemon (60:26 - 60:30)
as we move to encouraging trainers to (60:28 - 60:31)
play outside (60:30 - 60:33)
they will continue to receive supplies (60:31 - 60:34)
spinning stops (60:33 - 60:36)
after the changes the frequency of these (60:34 - 60:38)
buddies will be reduced (60:36 - 60:40)
okay no one cares about this the buddies (60:38 - 60:42)
brought like two potions and one (60:40 - 60:42)
pokeball (60:42 - 60:46)
and that's only if you actually like (60:42 - 60:48)
paid attention to it like i don't think (60:46 - 60:51)
anyone cared about this change (60:48 - 60:55)
i disagree but okay did you rely on it (60:51 - 60:58)
yeah yeah like i i i never relied on it (60:55 - 61:00)
because my thing was always full (60:58 - 61:03)
yeah all the time like my bag was always (61:00 - 61:04)
full so i could never (61:03 - 61:06)
know there were no stops near me like (61:04 - 61:08)
that i was in my house the only way i (61:06 - 61:10)
was getting anything or gifts to send (61:08 - 61:12)
to friends was through my buddy when i (61:10 - 61:13)
was waiting (61:12 - 61:16)
this is different from your buddy going (61:13 - 61:18)
out to the poke stops and grabbing stuff (61:16 - 61:20)
this is the little thing that they wrap (61:18 - 61:21)
up in a leaf (61:20 - 61:25)
mm-hmm you have (61:21 - 61:27)
it doesn't give you much no i never did (61:25 - 61:29)
it was it was like one potion and one (61:27 - 61:30)
pokeball (61:29 - 61:31)
no i mean i've got i've gotten a lot (61:30 - 61:34)
from that little from that (61:31 - 61:36)
from that back i've gotten huge swaths (61:34 - 61:37)
of potions (61:36 - 61:40)
i feel like you i would get way more if (61:37 - 61:42)
there was an option of like i need i (61:40 - 61:44)
need pokeballs and i need stuff i would (61:42 - 61:44)
just open (61:44 - 61:47)
my i would just open my 30 gifts and i (61:44 - 61:48)
would be (61:47 - 61:51)
maxed that's that's what might like if (61:48 - 61:53)
you were like i'm out of stuff to do (61:51 - 61:54)
open your gifts (61:53 - 61:56)
like i don't even have time to open my (61:54 - 61:58)
gifts most again i'm i'm (61:56 - 62:00)
a hardcore player so but like the reason (61:58 - 62:02)
i don't end up opening 30 gifts a day is (62:00 - 62:04)
because i have to like (62:02 - 62:07)
90 of my game is storage management so (62:04 - 62:08)
it's like i gotta delete berries i gotta (62:07 - 62:10)
leave pokeballs now i can open all 30 (62:08 - 62:12)
gifts but that also takes like 15 (62:10 - 62:13)
minutes to do so i'm just gonna skip it (62:12 - 62:17)
because i already got max items (62:13 - 62:17)
uh previously that's why you haven't (62:18 - 62:22)
opened my gifts (62:20 - 62:24)
i haven't opened your gifts either (62:22 - 62:25)
because i don't need your friendship (62:24 - 62:26)
bonuses (62:25 - 62:28)
pokestop and gym interaction distances (62:26 - 62:30)
were increased (62:28 - 62:33)
we were in we in a to enable people to (62:30 - 62:35)
engage from further away (62:33 - 62:37)
after this change the distance will (62:35 - 62:40)
revert back to the standard distance (62:37 - 62:42)
when it makes sense in different places (62:40 - 62:43)
though it may be (62:42 - 62:46)
increased during future events or past (62:43 - 62:46)
certain events (62:46 - 62:48)
okay so this what i just read here was (62:46 - 62:50)
what people were the most angry about so (62:48 - 62:52)
we'll come back to that (62:50 - 62:53)
remote raids have been an important part (62:52 - 62:55)
of the game in the past year and we're (62:53 - 62:57)
going to continue evolving them (62:55 - 62:58)
our intention is to find the rip right (62:57 - 63:00)
balance between remote play and in (62:58 - 63:01)
person (63:00 - 63:03)
play so stay tuned for more details many (63:01 - 63:05)
of these in-person raids (63:03 - 63:07)
changes will be in to prepare for the (63:05 - 63:09)
eventual return of ex rates hot take i (63:07 - 63:12)
love ex raids i hate ex raids (63:09 - 63:15)
i love them so much i love knowing that (63:12 - 63:17)
the ex raid is at 1 pm (63:15 - 63:18)
and when i will go there there will be (63:17 - 63:20)
other people there because we're all on (63:18 - 63:21)
a schedule (63:20 - 63:24)
and we do it and we leave i love it (63:21 - 63:28)
it's great the times and locations that (63:24 - 63:30)
they chose for the zx raids if you work (63:28 - 63:32)
a full-time job are not very conducive (63:30 - 63:35)
to that yeah but i hate that argument (63:32 - 63:37)
not everyone is nine to five though (63:35 - 63:39)
it's such a bad argument it's not a bad (63:37 - 63:41)
argument it's a realistic argument there (63:39 - 63:42)
are a ton of people in the bullying (63:41 - 63:43)
argument (63:42 - 63:44)
there's a ton of people who play this (63:43 - 63:46)
game yeah and there's a ton of people (63:44 - 63:48)
that are not nine to five (63:46 - 63:50)
there were pl i went to plenty of ex (63:48 - 63:51)
raids that were on saturdays and sundays (63:50 - 63:53)
i went to plenty ex raids that were (63:51 - 63:55)
after six o'clock (63:53 - 63:57)
yeah but not all of them are not all of (63:55 - 63:59)
them are at that time either if they're (63:57 - 64:01)
saying ex raids are (63:59 - 64:03)
i i don't care for them for that reason (64:01 - 64:04)
it it was a (64:03 - 64:06)
hit or mess whether you got it and it (64:04 - 64:07)
was a hit or miss if you got something (64:06 - 64:09)
that actually worked for you (64:07 - 64:11)
what is not my ideal way of doing raids (64:09 - 64:13)
what if they reintroduce them (64:11 - 64:16)
and say we'll assign you a time at first (64:13 - 64:18)
but if that time doesn't work for you (64:16 - 64:20)
then you can request to reschedule (64:18 - 64:22)
i will be cool i would like that or give (64:20 - 64:24)
you two options like we have uh we have (64:22 - 64:25)
a wednesday (64:24 - 64:26)
afternoon or we got a friday evening (64:25 - 64:28)
which one do you want yeah that would be (64:26 - 64:28)
cool (64:28 - 64:30)
that would that would be a better (64:28 - 64:32)
implementation implementation of ex (64:30 - 64:33)
rates (64:32 - 64:36)
i'm not a huge fan of ex rates (64:33 - 64:36)
bonuses introduced last year that we (64:39 - 64:44)
plan on keeping all right (64:41 - 64:44)
incense will remain at 60 minutes (64:45 - 64:51)
great perfect no more walking for go (64:48 - 64:52)
battle league (64:51 - 64:54)
i'm sure people were very excited about (64:52 - 64:56)
that you can challenge any trainer using (64:54 - 64:56)
a qr code (64:56 - 64:58)
and the requirement to battle with (64:56 - 65:00)
friends has been lowered to good friends (64:58 - 65:01)
which i think is (65:00 - 65:05)
seven days right yep (65:01 - 65:07)
uh maximum number of gifts you can carry (65:05 - 65:08)
will remain at (65:07 - 65:12)
20 but you will be able to open up 30 (65:08 - 65:13)
gifts a day (65:12 - 65:16)
from the 20 before it was 20 and 20. (65:13 - 65:18)
you will continue to receive three times (65:16 - 65:19)
the stardust and xp for your first (65:18 - 65:21)
pokemon catch of the day (65:19 - 65:22)
i think most people don't even know that (65:21 - 65:23)
was a change because the pandemic they (65:22 - 65:25)
just (65:23 - 65:27)
but that was a change uh and then you (65:25 - 65:30)
can check out for further updates (65:27 - 65:32)
okay so that was all the changes this (65:30 - 65:33)
was very heated (65:32 - 65:36)
um specifically because of the one thing (65:33 - 65:37)
i will reread it the one thing that (65:36 - 65:39)
everyone seemed to (65:37 - 65:42)
actually really be upset about um (65:39 - 65:43)
although i'm sure you can find somebody (65:42 - 65:45)
that was upset about the buddy feature (65:43 - 65:48)
uh pokestop and gym distance were (65:45 - 65:49)
increased (65:48 - 65:52)
enabling people to engage from further (65:49 - 65:53)
away (65:52 - 65:55)
after this change the distance will (65:53 - 65:57)
revert back to the standard distance (65:55 - 65:59)
when it makes sense in different places (65:57 - 66:00)
though it may be increased for future (65:59 - 66:03)
events or past (66:00 - 66:06)
or part of a certain feature (66:03 - 66:06)
okay so the drama the drama drama drama (66:07 - 66:15)
uh here's the thing uh (66:11 - 66:18)
when this happened specifically this (66:15 - 66:21)
pokestop and gym distance uh (66:18 - 66:24)
people on twitter and reddit and in (66:21 - 66:25)
discord communities and (66:24 - 66:27)
on facebook i'm sure i don't go to (66:25 - 66:28)
facebook but i'm sure they were angry (66:27 - 66:29)
over there (66:28 - 66:32)
uh we're very angry about this change (66:29 - 66:33)
specifically (66:32 - 66:37)
and they were complaining to (66:33 - 66:40)
niantic on twitter but (66:37 - 66:43)
they also went to niantic's (66:40 - 66:46)
employees twitters to complain because (66:43 - 66:48)
they felt like (66:46 - 66:52)
niantic wasn't listening to them (66:48 - 66:52)
in this regard and specifically (66:53 - 67:00)
liz who some (66:57 - 67:03)
hardcore people might know is the head (67:00 - 67:03)
of (67:03 - 67:07)
social media for pokemon go for niantic (67:03 - 67:08)
in the united states (67:07 - 67:11)
now there is different managers for (67:08 - 67:14)
you know india korea japan and there are (67:11 - 67:16)
different managers for different games (67:14 - 67:21)
so like niantic has a media manager for (67:16 - 67:23)
ingress and for harry potter wizards (67:21 - 67:25)
unite liz specifically only deals with (67:23 - 67:26)
pokemon go (67:25 - 67:28)
i've worked with liz a ton of times (67:26 - 67:29)
she's incredible (67:28 - 67:33)
she's great uh and she has said for the (67:29 - 67:34)
last (67:33 - 67:36)
however many years that her twitter (67:34 - 67:37)
account is her (67:36 - 67:40)
personal twitter account she does not (67:37 - 67:42)
report on anything niantic official (67:40 - 67:44)
even in her little bio it says hey if (67:42 - 67:45)
you're having trouble with pokemon go (67:44 - 67:48)
sorry i cannot help you you must use (67:45 - 67:50)
at niantic support or whatever it is (67:48 - 67:52)
pokemon go support (67:50 - 67:55)
um but if people were like hey when is (67:52 - 67:58)
caterpie getting a cowboy hat she would (67:55 - 68:00)
be like hey i can't answer that but if (67:58 - 68:01)
you want to give feedback (68:00 - 68:03)
about the caterpie hat here is where you (68:01 - 68:04)
can go (68:03 - 68:08)
um and because (68:04 - 68:11)
people were so upset about the pokestop (68:08 - 68:12)
and gym (68:11 - 68:15)
in interaction distances were increased (68:12 - 68:17)
or now they're now they're decreasing (68:15 - 68:18)
they personally attacked (68:17 - 68:22)
liz on her personal twitter and she (68:18 - 68:24)
has deactivated her twitter she's now (68:22 - 68:27)
gone from twitter (68:24 - 68:30)
and we haven't heard it from her since (68:27 - 68:33)
and it is incredibly unfortunate and (68:30 - 68:37)
incredibly frustrating (68:33 - 68:37)
that at the end of the day this is just (68:37 - 68:42)
a video game (68:39 - 68:42)
and a lot of people like it but there is (68:43 - 68:47)
never (68:45 - 68:50)
there is a no situation where you need (68:47 - 68:51)
to (68:50 - 68:54)
harass a single niantic employee (68:51 - 68:57)
for a game that has decisions (68:54 - 69:00)
not made by her made by two global (68:57 - 69:05)
goliaths niantic in the pokemon company (69:00 - 69:08)
and her job is just to make sure that (69:05 - 69:10)
she gets that information out there the (69:08 - 69:12)
best she can right because like (69:10 - 69:13)
if she personally had a problem with (69:12 - 69:15)
something she ain't she isn't going to (69:13 - 69:16)
complain about it on her personal (69:15 - 69:18)
twitter (69:16 - 69:18)
she's going to use the pokemon go (69:19 - 69:22)
twitter to (69:20 - 69:24)
communicate what needs to be communicate (69:22 - 69:25)
the best that she can communicate it (69:24 - 69:28)
yep i just i don't understand because (69:25 - 69:29)
it's like (69:28 - 69:31)
this is a change that was made because (69:29 - 69:33)
of a change in the circumstances of the (69:31 - 69:34)
world (69:33 - 69:36)
the world is reverting back to what it (69:34 - 69:38)
some somewhat what it used to be (69:36 - 69:39)
so those changes are going to get (69:38 - 69:41)
reverted back this is i mean how things (69:39 - 69:42)
work (69:41 - 69:44)
i understand why people are frustrated (69:42 - 69:46)
with it i do too (69:44 - 69:49)
and i i get that that it there is no (69:46 - 69:50)
reason there's no real (69:49 - 69:53)
good reason to change it back like it (69:50 - 69:54)
helped a lot of (69:53 - 69:56)
people it helped in a lot of ways (69:54 - 69:58)
whether they intended it or not (69:56 - 69:59)
and they can sell more remote raid (69:58 - 70:02)
passes taking it away is a money move (69:59 - 70:03)
right like there (70:02 - 70:05)
there are business decisions not (70:03 - 70:07)
personal decisions why they made this (70:05 - 70:07)
change (70:07 - 70:09)
i don't agree with it i think they (70:07 - 70:10)
should have just left it because it (70:09 - 70:11)
really (70:10 - 70:14)
it helped a lot of people and they feel (70:11 - 70:17)
discounted what is the problem is that (70:14 - 70:18)
when they (70:17 - 70:21)
take that into personal attacks and (70:18 - 70:21)
drive (70:21 - 70:25)
an employee away (70:21 - 70:25)
it ultimately hurts what you're trying (70:25 - 70:29)
to get across (70:28 - 70:30)
because you did it in such a poor (70:29 - 70:32)
fashion that people can (70:30 - 70:35)
easily write you off and it is never (70:32 - 70:38)
ever ever ever ever okay to attack (70:35 - 70:39)
another human being for the decision (70:38 - 70:40)
that your (70:39 - 70:43)
company made there are a lot of things (70:40 - 70:45)
that my company does that i hate (70:43 - 70:47)
the amount of input they come to me for (70:45 - 70:49)
those day-to-day decisions (70:47 - 70:52)
is exactly zero uh you can be mad at me (70:49 - 70:55)
but that's fine i can't change them a (70:52 - 70:57)
single person doesn't (70:55 - 71:01)
deserve abuse because you're mad (70:57 - 71:03)
in the minute you can make the decision (71:01 - 71:05)
that yes niantic (71:03 - 71:08)
has made a very poor decision uh (71:05 - 71:10)
is one that you absolutely don't agree (71:08 - 71:12)
with and it's one that you can decide (71:10 - 71:14)
whether or not you wish to continue (71:12 - 71:15)
doing business with that company (71:14 - 71:20)
if they show no efforts to communicate (71:15 - 71:22)
you when you are trying to communicate (71:20 - 71:26)
reasonably when you become unreasonable (71:22 - 71:28)
it is easy for the company to ignore you (71:26 - 71:31)
it is easy for the company to point out (71:28 - 71:34)
to your poor behavior and write you off (71:31 - 71:35)
as a bad actor (71:34 - 71:37)
especially if you drive somebody off a (71:35 - 71:38)
social media (71:37 - 71:41)
platform it is a terrible decision that (71:38 - 71:42)
you made (71:41 - 71:46)
and you should just not do it it's not (71:42 - 71:48)
it is not right you don't want people (71:46 - 71:50)
attacking you don't attack other people (71:48 - 71:52)
it is incredibly frustrating when they (71:50 - 71:54)
do this and they do this about (71:52 - 71:56)
a million things in a million fandoms (71:54 - 71:58)
they have chased people off (71:56 - 72:01)
social media platforms (71:58 - 72:01)
just for the dumbest most frustrating (72:02 - 72:05)
reasons (72:04 - 72:08)
and people will point to that example as (72:05 - 72:11)
a way to discount your opinion (72:08 - 72:14)
for the rest of time (72:11 - 72:14)
because you proved yourself to be an (72:15 - 72:19)
ultimate (72:18 - 72:22)
jerk troll yep what's also interesting (72:19 - 72:22)
too (72:22 - 72:26)
is as part of this dynamic is that (72:22 - 72:29)
there are sufficient people who (72:26 - 72:31)
are like i play this game i don't put (72:29 - 72:33)
many any money into it (72:31 - 72:36)
right that then they can't say well i'm (72:33 - 72:38)
voting with my dollar (72:36 - 72:40)
i'm going to walk around way and not pay (72:38 - 72:42)
for this anymore so then they're like (72:40 - 72:43)
well then how can i affect (72:42 - 72:47)
change but of course you don't affect (72:43 - 72:48)
change by being a troll (72:47 - 72:52)
right so the frustrating thing (72:48 - 72:55)
too is like i feel like the people (72:52 - 72:57)
yelling at liz or other employees on (72:55 - 72:58)
niantic (72:57 - 73:01)
and there are look you can find the (72:58 - 73:01)
other (73:01 - 73:03)
niantic employees you can find the ones (73:01 - 73:05)
that are liz's boss (73:03 - 73:09)
or liz's boss's boss on twitter (73:05 - 73:14)
um but because liz has social media (73:09 - 73:17)
right in her job title and because liz (73:14 - 73:20)
is active on pogo uh or sorry active on (73:17 - 73:21)
twitter as like (73:20 - 73:23)
you know just somebody who was twitter a (73:21 - 73:25)
lot um (73:23 - 73:28)
i guess people decided to go to her but (73:25 - 73:29)
what these people don't understand (73:28 - 73:31)
and i'm assuming it's the people i i (73:29 - 73:32)
know for sure it's the people yelling at (73:31 - 73:33)
liz (73:32 - 73:37)
and as like i've talked with liz tons of (73:33 - 73:39)
times like i said i've worked with her (73:37 - 73:42)
and niantic on stuff uh i've always told (73:39 - 73:44)
you guys when you know (73:42 - 73:46)
if niantic pays for my event i let you (73:44 - 73:48)
guys know (73:46 - 73:48)
but she deeply cares about pokemon (73:49 - 73:55)
and pokemon go yep like she (73:52 - 73:58)
wants the game to be the best it can be (73:55 - 73:59)
and she maybe (73:58 - 74:03)
personally disagreed with the radius (73:59 - 74:05)
change but she can't say that on her (74:03 - 74:07)
personal twitter because that's (74:05 - 74:11)
not allowed and she behind the scenes (74:07 - 74:14)
could have been fighting to keep it and (74:11 - 74:18)
maybe we needed more time and (74:14 - 74:19)
to all those people that were like well (74:18 - 74:21)
she should have just communicated that (74:19 - 74:24)
that's not how it works on her personal (74:21 - 74:25)
twitter (74:24 - 74:28)
have you ever had any sort of corporate (74:25 - 74:29)
job yeah (74:28 - 74:31)
it's not how corporations work it's not (74:29 - 74:34)
how corporate jobs work (74:31 - 74:38)
you people get fired over what they put (74:34 - 74:41)
on their social media if it disparages (74:38 - 74:42)
the company (74:41 - 74:44)
if it goes against what their official (74:42 - 74:45)
statement is (74:44 - 74:48)
people will lose their job if it's even (74:45 - 74:50)
it's on the personal twitter and you (74:48 - 74:51)
think that personal twitter is locked (74:50 - 74:52)
away (74:51 - 74:56)
so they can't find it people even if for (74:52 - 74:56)
whatever (74:56 - 75:00)
crazy reason you were like oh well (74:56 - 75:03)
liz didn't listen to us or or liz didn't (75:00 - 75:05)
fight for us (75:03 - 75:07)
it's not like she's getting your raid (75:05 - 75:09)
dollars when you do like (75:07 - 75:12)
right yeah but also that's not her (75:09 - 75:12)
position (75:12 - 75:14)
in the company she's not making (75:12 - 75:16)
decisions about the architecture of the (75:14 - 75:16)
pro (75:16 - 75:18)
of the game right all she's doing is (75:16 - 75:19)
communicating (75:18 - 75:23)
what she's been given to communicate and (75:19 - 75:26)
i don't if you think if you think you (75:23 - 75:26)
are safe (75:26 - 75:29)
if you think oh she could have hide it (75:26 - 75:30)
on an alt account (75:29 - 75:32)
there are people that find all counts (75:30 - 75:34)
print out twitter and send it to the (75:32 - 75:34)
company (75:34 - 75:37)
to deliberately get them fired this is (75:34 - 75:38)
hap this happens (75:37 - 75:40)
multiple times this happens multiple (75:38 - 75:41)
ways (75:40 - 75:45)
people will ruin people's lives and jobs (75:41 - 75:46)
over these things (75:45 - 75:48)
so don't think like oh she could have (75:46 - 75:49)
coded it or she could have hid it or she (75:48 - 75:51)
could use a separate thing to let us all (75:49 - 75:52)
know (75:51 - 75:54)
if she's letting you know her bosses (75:52 - 75:55)
will find out (75:54 - 75:58)
and they will have grounds for (75:55 - 75:59)
termination (75:58 - 76:01)
the pokemon go community doesn't realize (75:59 - 76:03)
how great liz (76:01 - 76:06)
is like other games would (76:03 - 76:08)
love to have somebody who is so (76:06 - 76:11)
passionate about not only their product (76:08 - 76:14)
but the the brand itself which is (76:11 - 76:15)
pokemon (76:14 - 76:19)
right like liz both cared so much about (76:15 - 76:21)
pogo and wanting pogo to be the best (76:19 - 76:22)
game it can be (76:21 - 76:24)
but she also is a huge pokemon fan and (76:22 - 76:26)
was a huge pokemon fan (76:24 - 76:30)
before pogo was even a thing (76:26 - 76:30)
and have her driven off twitter because (76:32 - 76:35)
people are upset (76:34 - 76:38)
that their game is changing (76:35 - 76:42)
and like to me it's like yes this change (76:38 - 76:43)
sucks (76:42 - 76:46)
but you also played the game for over (76:43 - 76:48)
four years with it like this (76:46 - 76:51)
it's not like exactly yeah i mean (76:48 - 76:54)
like i get that it like there there is (76:51 - 76:57)
not i can't sit here and be like (76:54 - 76:59)
well they're they're changing it because (76:57 - 77:00)
of this because there's really not a (76:59 - 77:01)
good (77:00 - 77:04)
reason for them to change it but that's (77:01 - 77:06)
the saying like oh this is the way it (77:04 - 77:07)
was (77:06 - 77:10)
when you get an improved version for (77:07 - 77:11)
them to say well we're going to go back (77:10 - 77:13)
to the version that was bad (77:11 - 77:15)
is always going to taste bad yeah you (77:13 - 77:17)
know i played it i played it like this (77:15 - 77:19)
for four years and it was not (77:17 - 77:21)
great it was an irritant you finally (77:19 - 77:23)
fixed the irritant it's like saying (77:21 - 77:25)
i wasn't an errand but like it wasn't (77:23 - 77:26)
actually irritating (77:25 - 77:28)
it was for some people in remote (77:26 - 77:30)
locations people who have (77:28 - 77:32)
mobility problems there are multiple (77:30 - 77:33)
issues that feed into this (77:32 - 77:36)
it wasn't an issue to you like it's like (77:33 - 77:37)
saying i had thick (77:36 - 77:39)
socks on and never felt the pebble in my (77:37 - 77:41)
shoe it was great when you finally took (77:39 - 77:42)
it out and now you put another pebble on (77:41 - 77:44)
my shoe and i feel it again (77:42 - 77:45)
i don't feel it as bad it's still there (77:44 - 77:47)
but i can still walk (77:45 - 77:49)
there are people who couldn't play the (77:47 - 77:51)
game because of these restrictions (77:49 - 77:54)
and could once it got released there was (77:51 - 77:57)
things tied into this because it didn't (77:54 - 77:58)
affect you as (77:57 - 78:00)
bad it still isn't a reason that it's (77:58 - 78:03)
fine to go back to it (78:00 - 78:03)
yes i mean so people have i think (78:04 - 78:10)
people are rightly upset the going back (78:08 - 78:13)
going back to the way it was (78:10 - 78:16)
for not great reasons (78:13 - 78:20)
feels bad especially to people who found (78:16 - 78:20)
the game (78:20 - 78:23)
so much more playable who are now being (78:20 - 78:25)
told reverting back to a game (78:23 - 78:28)
that isn't as playable for you that does (78:25 - 78:29)
once again (78:28 - 78:30)
create an obstacle for you playing the (78:29 - 78:32)
game after (78:30 - 78:36)
15 months of this and (78:32 - 78:39)
we're going back mostly it feels like (78:36 - 78:40)
for money (78:39 - 78:42)
it's a bad experience and it's one they (78:40 - 78:43)
didn't have to do (78:42 - 78:47)
but also fundamentally the only (78:43 - 78:51)
way that niantic is going to notice (78:47 - 78:53)
that this has had an impact on player (78:51 - 78:54)
base (78:53 - 78:58)
is from a change in income and we know (78:54 - 79:00)
they will see no change in income i (78:58 - 79:04)
don't get how this makes them more money (79:00 - 79:04)
because like people are can't reach a (79:05 - 79:09)
pokestop now so they're going to (79:07 - 79:11)
buy pokeballs and they're shopping yeah (79:09 - 79:13)
they'll buy pokeballs still get stuff (79:11 - 79:16)
they'll do raid passes that gym that was (79:13 - 79:18)
reachable from their (79:16 - 79:20)
from their house is now a remote raid (79:18 - 79:21)
pass because (79:20 - 79:24)
they can't get to it for whatever reason (79:21 - 79:28)
it does affect in minor ways how people (79:24 - 79:30)
have to interact with the game (79:28 - 79:33)
for not real great reasons going back to (79:30 - 79:34)
the way it was (79:33 - 79:36)
when the world isn't back to the way it (79:34 - 79:39)
was it it it's no i i agree with that (79:36 - 79:39)
like (79:39 - 79:43)
it feels not great across all levels i (79:39 - 79:44)
get why people are mad and for (79:43 - 79:47)
people who this really impacts like in (79:44 - 79:49)
rural areas (79:47 - 79:51)
people who are you know who have (79:49 - 79:52)
mobility issues (79:51 - 79:56)
these things do hurt and i (79:52 - 79:58)
i think we all sort of need to (79:56 - 80:00)
acknowledge the fact that (79:58 - 80:02)
there are a segment of players who these (80:00 - 80:03)
things really (80:02 - 80:06)
do hurt more than it affects us i can (80:03 - 80:08)
get my car and drive wherever i el (80:06 - 80:10)
i'll have to do it and it puts me out (80:08 - 80:12)
for some people it is a much harder (80:10 - 80:13)
burden (80:12 - 80:16)
for not a great reason and i think (80:13 - 80:20)
i think it's that sort of message of (80:16 - 80:21)
we're constantly monitoring and we're (80:20 - 80:22)
wandering our (80:21 - 80:24)
player base and we're invested to how (80:22 - 80:26)
you play the game and this is those two (80:24 - 80:28)
messages (80:26 - 80:30)
don't fit well together and that makes (80:28 - 80:32)
people very angry (80:30 - 80:34)
and i i understand that and i think that (80:32 - 80:36)
anger is valid i think your expression (80:34 - 80:37)
of anger (80:36 - 80:40)
is not necessarily the way that that (80:37 - 80:41)
should happen (80:40 - 80:45)
yes no like there there (80:41 - 80:47)
are plenty of minor changes that have (80:45 - 80:49)
driven me away from a game and the (80:47 - 80:50)
example i used on twitter (80:49 - 80:53)
was destiny like i put four years into (80:50 - 80:54)
destiny (80:53 - 80:56)
1500 plus hours i played it with will (80:54 - 80:59)
and irene almost every single night (80:56 - 81:01)
like i was the person that was buying (80:59 - 81:02)
the 50 (81:01 - 81:04)
emblems because i wanted every single (81:02 - 81:06)
emblem (81:04 - 81:09)
in my game and destiny 2 changed such (81:06 - 81:12)
enough little things that it wasn't (81:09 - 81:14)
enjoyable for me anymore (81:12 - 81:17)
and they were pretty little things um (81:14 - 81:19)
and i just walked away from destiny i (81:17 - 81:20)
didn't (81:19 - 81:23)
find developers on twitter to tweet at i (81:20 - 81:24)
didn't (81:23 - 81:28)
make huge threads on reddit complaining (81:24 - 81:30)
i just moved on to a different game and (81:28 - 81:32)
there are plenty of games out there (81:30 - 81:35)
and if if these changes are frustrating (81:32 - 81:38)
enough to you (81:35 - 81:38)
i get it i get walking away from the (81:38 - 81:42)
game (81:41 - 81:46)
they are not frustrating enough for me (81:42 - 81:50)
because my vision of what pokemon go is (81:46 - 81:53)
is lined up with niantic's vision which (81:50 - 81:53)
is (81:53 - 81:56)
i want to go outside and i want to (81:53 - 81:59)
go explore and i want to spin stops and (81:56 - 82:02)
this was something (81:59 - 82:03)
like a friend i used to play go with a (82:02 - 82:05)
lot we always disagreed with (82:03 - 82:07)
because they didn't want to walk they (82:05 - 82:09)
wanted to get into their car (82:07 - 82:11)
and they wanted to drive to stop to stop (82:09 - 82:13)
and i would do that because like (82:11 - 82:15)
that's what they wanted to do and that (82:13 - 82:16)
was most comfortable for them (82:15 - 82:19)
but i hated playing go like that i (82:16 - 82:21)
wanted to be on my feet i wanted to walk (82:19 - 82:23)
from place to place and i i there is (82:21 - 82:25)
like a small i guess respect that i have (82:23 - 82:27)
for niantic to be like (82:25 - 82:28)
this is how we want people to play our (82:27 - 82:30)
game we want people to go outside (82:28 - 82:32)
we want people to walk we want them to (82:30 - 82:33)
explore new places (82:32 - 82:35)
go like i've never been over to that (82:33 - 82:37)
location i've never spun that pokestop i (82:35 - 82:38)
guess i'm gonna walk there for the first (82:37 - 82:38)
time (82:38 - 82:41)
i i have a respect for that of like this (82:38 - 82:43)
is how (82:41 - 82:46)
we want people to do that (82:43 - 82:48)
and i totally again i totally agree with (82:46 - 82:49)
people being like (82:48 - 82:52)
why decrease the pokestop distance what (82:49 - 82:56)
are you getting out of it i don't (82:52 - 82:58)
the thing is is i think i think they (82:56 - 82:59)
showed that they had (82:58 - 83:02)
great ideas of how to how to (82:59 - 83:04)
get people to play the game they want (83:02 - 83:06)
the game to be played right like there (83:04 - 83:07)
are bonuses for (83:06 - 83:08)
walking and all those things like they (83:07 - 83:11)
did they added those perks in so like (83:08 - 83:14)
you get a benefit if you play the game (83:11 - 83:15)
the way that they (83:14 - 83:18)
envision the game being played what's (83:15 - 83:19)
frustrating is (83:18 - 83:22)
is they also took (83:19 - 83:26)
took what feels like a punitive measure (83:22 - 83:29)
as well to say we also (83:26 - 83:32)
don't want you to play this way and that (83:29 - 83:32)
yeah (83:32 - 83:34)
that is not a great thing for a company (83:32 - 83:36)
to do (83:34 - 83:38)
no matter what like if you really want (83:36 - 83:40)
to encourage them to play a certain way (83:38 - 83:44)
encourage them but don't (83:40 - 83:46)
mandate them is i think really where (83:44 - 83:48)
some of the problem comes into and i'll (83:46 - 83:50)
say another thing like (83:48 - 83:52)
i just did that really well with weather (83:50 - 83:54)
by the way yes when they introduced (83:52 - 83:56)
weather they didn't want to discourage (83:54 - 83:57)
people (83:56 - 83:58)
in any way so when you're catching (83:57 - 84:00)
weather boosted pokemon you are getting (83:58 - 84:02)
rewarded for it so i think i think (84:00 - 84:04)
right they they figured it out and i (84:02 - 84:06)
feel like they nailed it the first time (84:04 - 84:07)
with weather and they don't get enough (84:06 - 84:08)
credit for that (84:07 - 84:11)
yeah uh but you're never you're you're (84:08 - 84:13)
only judged by your last success or (84:11 - 84:14)
failure (84:13 - 84:16)
uh the past doesn't matter i think uh i (84:14 - 84:18)
think it's okay to go (84:16 - 84:20)
express to the company of a game that (84:18 - 84:21)
you love (84:20 - 84:23)
that you hope they will change before (84:21 - 84:24)
you walk away (84:23 - 84:26)
i'm not telling people not to i think (84:24 - 84:29)
it's fine to go to a reddit to say (84:26 - 84:33)
this is my my thoughts i agree with this (84:29 - 84:34)
i think it's okay to write them a letter (84:33 - 84:36)
i think it's okay to reach out to them (84:34 - 84:37)
in email or (84:36 - 84:39)
on twitter in a respectful way to say (84:37 - 84:42)
here's what this does to me (84:39 - 84:45)
please understand and if after you have (84:42 - 84:46)
done that (84:45 - 84:48)
and they still don't listen then make (84:46 - 84:50)
your choice whether you can accept it or (84:48 - 84:52)
move on (84:50 - 84:54)
i don't want to come across like like (84:52 - 84:55)
like just pick up your (84:54 - 84:57)
pick up your bags and leave i mean that (84:55 - 84:58)
is absolutely an option (84:57 - 85:00)
that's the option i usually take like i (84:58 - 85:02)
don't i don't care enough about the (85:00 - 85:04)
state of your game and making you money (85:02 - 85:06)
for me to tell you how to fix your game (85:04 - 85:07)
so i'm just gonna walk (85:06 - 85:09)
there are a lot of people who are way (85:07 - 85:10)
more invested in things than i am (85:09 - 85:13)
and i would say yes make your make your (85:10 - 85:14)
opinion (85:13 - 85:17)
heard in a respectful (85:14 - 85:19)
calm manner because that is going to be (85:17 - 85:20)
taken (85:19 - 85:23)
a lot more seriously than driving (85:20 - 85:26)
somebody off of the internet because (85:23 - 85:28)
you are making death threats or a (85:26 - 85:30)
million other horrible things that (85:28 - 85:32)
people do (85:30 - 85:32)
i don't know if i have anything else (85:39 - 85:42)
i do if i ever saw anyone in our (85:43 - 85:47)
discords communities (85:45 - 85:50)
uh slacks if i saw you tweeting that (85:47 - 85:50)
kind of (85:50 - 85:54)
stuff at a pokemon employee (85:50 - 85:56)
niantic game freak you would be banned (85:54 - 85:58)
from our community (85:56 - 86:00)
instantly (85:58 - 86:02)
[Music] (86:00 - 86:06)
i don't want people in our communities (86:02 - 86:06)
harassing other employees because they (86:06 - 86:10)
are an unhappy of tree texture (86:08 - 86:13)
in sword and shield the trees do look (86:10 - 86:14)
bad (86:13 - 86:16)
we just stop would you stop stop that's (86:14 - 86:17)
right (86:16 - 86:21)
are fine they're fine they're subpar (86:17 - 86:26)
oh you're subject reality (86:21 - 86:26)
it's an art style (86:27 - 86:30)
the the problem the yeah the the problem (86:32 - 86:36)
is like niantic always seems to just (86:34 - 86:38)
drop the ball in communication (86:36 - 86:41)
they do they do they make decisions they (86:38 - 86:43)
tend to make decisions in a very (86:41 - 86:46)
narrow field and don't explain their (86:43 - 86:48)
narrat why they've chosen a narrow field (86:46 - 86:49)
like (86:48 - 86:51)
there's a lot of people who fall out and (86:49 - 86:54)
there's a lot of good reasons that (86:51 - 86:57)
like never seem to be addressed or (86:54 - 86:58)
considered (86:57 - 87:00)
in in the way they communicate and i (86:58 - 87:02)
think that adds to the frustration (87:00 - 87:06)
and this is across so many companies (87:02 - 87:09)
who who put things out (87:06 - 87:11)
and and and they're just like and that's (87:09 - 87:13)
the decision we made and we did all of (87:11 - 87:14)
this research and it's like (87:13 - 87:16)
two seconds you get to see all this and (87:14 - 87:18)
you didn't address it but but even even (87:16 - 87:20)
more than that fundamentally every (87:18 - 87:21)
corporation (87:20 - 87:23)
they will not ever say this to you right (87:21 - 87:24)
but there (87:23 - 87:26)
are customers and communities they care (87:24 - 87:28)
about there are customers and (87:26 - 87:30)
communities they don't care about (87:28 - 87:31)
and if you're in the set that they don't (87:30 - 87:34)
care about they don't care about you (87:31 - 87:35)
and they're not making decisions to (87:34 - 87:39)
benefit you done (87:35 - 87:39)
i think overall this press release was (87:45 - 87:49)
fine i think it was good (87:47 - 87:52)
it's fine i mean uh the (87:49 - 87:55)
i i think probably if the pokestop thing (87:52 - 87:56)
wasn't here (87:55 - 87:58)
most people would be like okay yeah we (87:56 - 88:00)
figured this was coming um we'll see (87:58 - 88:02)
what niantic does (88:00 - 88:05)
uh i guess you could maybe argue that (88:02 - 88:06)
they (88:05 - 88:09)
backtracked on mega stuff after (88:06 - 88:12)
people complained even though i think (88:09 - 88:14)
all the changes didn't make anyone feel (88:12 - 88:15)
better (88:14 - 88:18)
at all and like i said on the show (88:15 - 88:20)
i bet they would have done all of those (88:18 - 88:22)
changes anyways because (88:20 - 88:26)
everything in pogo is very hard up front (88:22 - 88:29)
a couple months pass slightly easier a (88:26 - 88:30)
year passes (88:29 - 88:33)
give it to everyone it's literally just (88:30 - 88:35)
a patience game with them (88:33 - 88:37)
um so i really don't think the (88:35 - 88:39)
complaints about mega evolution actually (88:37 - 88:41)
affected anything i think they just (88:39 - 88:43)
well i think they were going to do those (88:41 - 88:44)
changes anyways they just moved them up (88:43 - 88:47)
like two weeks (88:44 - 88:47)
question of the week (88:50 - 88:54)
all right question of the week (88:55 - 89:00)
hallelujah question of the week (88:57 - 89:04)
it's that time again (89:00 - 89:04)
it's not raining anywhere the sun came (89:04 - 89:08)
out greg it was raining earlier (89:06 - 89:12)
that's true uh (89:08 - 89:15)
it's the last podcast of pride so i (89:12 - 89:16)
guess we'll do this one (89:15 - 89:18)

tone rings a wonderful question from two (89:18 - 89:22)
weeks ago that was not selected what (89:20 - 89:23)

call it yeah speedster rengar is a (93:02 - 93:05)
speedster i think yeah (93:03 - 93:08)
here's a here's a real hot take (93:05 - 93:12)
mill tank think of miltank rolling (93:08 - 93:17)
like roll out okay why (93:12 - 93:20)
because it like i don't know just the (93:17 - 93:21)
the (93:20 - 93:24)
visual on unite the visual of a cow (93:21 - 93:26)
rolling through a battlefield is just (93:24 - 93:29)
very it's very good (93:26 - 93:31)
yeah it could replenish its own health (93:29 - 93:32)
milk drink (93:31 - 93:34)
yeah i could see it as a support and (93:32 - 93:35)
then it has an (93:34 - 93:37)
ultimate roll through the entire like (93:35 - 93:38)
like kramer (93:37 - 93:40)
goes up and like grabs onto his utter (93:38 - 93:43)
and then also gets health back (93:40 - 93:45)
and you're you are shaking your head at (93:43 - 93:47)
me about the pride choices (93:45 - 93:49)
and you're gonna bring that into the (93:47 - 93:51)
conversation (93:49 - 93:51)
i want to see talonflame and pokemon (93:52 - 93:56)
unite (93:54 - 94:00)

uh volcarona (94:00 - 94:07)
well you know i was actually thinking my (94:05 - 94:08)
honest answer was (94:07 - 94:11)
where are our moth slash butterfly based (94:08 - 94:12)
pokemon (94:11 - 94:15)
in this pro in this game i wouldn't want (94:12 - 94:17)
butterfree give me the venom off (94:15 - 94:21)
i mean okay fine can we get (94:17 - 94:24)
one of them though yeah we need our uh (94:21 - 94:26)
we need vivio (94:24 - 94:30)
vivillon volcarona yeah (94:26 - 94:33)
would be good valkyrie (94:30 - 94:33)
definitely not it's like like slowing (94:38 - 94:42)
them down (94:40 - 94:45)
the quiver dancing the string shot and (94:42 - 94:48)
yeah (94:45 - 94:49)
what about poison do we have any (94:48 - 94:51)
poisoners out there (94:49 - 94:53)
i guess gengar is gonna be uh yeah (94:51 - 94:54)
gengar is probably a poisoner because i (94:53 - 94:56)
think like scoloped (94:54 - 95:01)
might be kind of cool (94:56 - 95:03)
oh yeah sculpey would be great jeff (95:01 - 95:06)
would play skulloped for sure (95:03 - 95:06)
all right question of the week well (95:09 - 95:12)
welcome another week will (95:10 - 95:15)
oh sorry pokemon so last week's pokemon (95:12 - 95:16)
i don't think (95:15 - 95:20)
that i said it specifically (95:16 - 95:23)
but it is in a very unique category (95:20 - 95:25)
because of its weight (95:23 - 95:28)
so its weight affects how much damage or (95:25 - 95:30)
what the attack power of low kick and (95:28 - 95:31)
grass not are (95:30 - 95:34)
uh its weight impacts whether it has a (95:31 - 95:36)
modifier for getting caught by a heavy (95:34 - 95:36)
ball (95:36 - 95:38)
whether it can compete in fancy cup (95:36 - 95:41)
light cup and whether it can or cannot (95:38 - 95:43)
be taken into the air by skydrop (95:41 - 95:46)
here who even knew that if a pokemon is (95:43 - 95:48)
too heavy it can't be picked up by (95:46 - 95:50)
skydrop this was news to me (95:48 - 95:53)
uh and also its evolution (95:50 - 95:56)
is jeff's favorite pokemon and i feel (95:53 - 95:58)
justified in saying that since jeff was (95:56 - 95:59)
referenced (95:58 - 96:02)
as a potential member of team (95:59 - 96:05)
rush so there you go (96:02 - 96:09)
[Music] (96:05 - 96:09)
chata (96:10 - 96:12)
chat is eligible for fancy and light cup (96:14 - 96:20)
it's bergmite bergmite (96:17 - 96:23)
it's just because of that strange thing (96:20 - 96:26)
about its particular weight that it is (96:23 - 96:28)
the only pokemon (96:26 - 96:31)
that meets all of those criteria very (96:28 - 96:33)
strange (96:31 - 96:36)
and avalon is jeff's favorite yes have a (96:33 - 96:37)
log (96:36 - 96:39)
is well i mean may not be anymore i (96:37 - 96:40)
don't know (96:39 - 96:43)
at a time yeah yeah (96:40 - 96:48)
jeff's uh the shuffle icon is incredible (96:43 - 96:50)
because it's the entire pokemon oh it's (96:48 - 96:51)
a little guy (96:50 - 96:54)
have you guys hi i like the sh i do like (96:51 - 96:55)
the shiny (96:54 - 96:57)
i feel a little conflicted about the (96:55 - 97:00)
fact that it's yellow snow but (96:57 - 97:03)
well you know i said a little conflicted (97:00 - 97:05)
not majorly conflicted i mean is it snow (97:03 - 97:07)
or is it ice i mean (97:05 - 97:08)
we're splitting hairs at that point (97:07 - 97:11)
aren't we yeah (97:08 - 97:11)
yeah what about next week (97:12 - 97:18)
all right we have no there's literally (97:15 - 97:22)
no there's unfortunately (97:18 - 97:22)
here we go this is for all the pokemon (97:22 - 97:26)
go drama (97:24 - 97:28)
this is the pokemon go pokemon of the (97:26 - 97:29)
week (97:28 - 97:32)
i finally added this week's pokemon to (97:29 - 97:34)
my pokedex by completing a portion (97:32 - 97:37)
of a special research task that began on (97:34 - 97:38)
december 14 (97:37 - 97:42)
2020 it is not the final goal pokemon of (97:38 - 97:44)
the special research (97:42 - 97:46)
but only one you collect along the way (97:44 - 97:48)
after giving your buddy (97:46 - 97:51)
10 treats jesse and james are no longer (97:48 - 97:54)
required for this special research (97:51 - 97:56)
this pokemon was a notable addition to (97:54 - 97:58)
my pokemon go collection because (97:56 - 98:01)
it seems like it should be a relatively (97:58 - 98:02)
common (98:01 - 98:03)
it seems like it should be relatively (98:02 - 98:05)
common but i had neither caught it in (98:03 - 98:07)
the wild nor hatched it from an egg (98:05 - 98:10)
since it's in its initial release on may (98:07 - 98:10)
17 (98:10 - 98:14)
2019. it turns out that this pokemon is (98:10 - 98:17)
not usually available from eggs and can (98:14 - 98:19)
only be caught when a mossy lure (98:17 - 98:22)
is used on a pokestop this pokemon has (98:19 - 98:24)
two fast attacks (98:22 - 98:26)
bullet seed and tackle and three charged (98:24 - 98:27)
attacks (98:26 - 98:29)
dazzling gleam petal blizzard and seed (98:27 - 98:30)
bomb (98:29 - 98:33)
this pokemon can evolve into one of two (98:30 - 98:34)
final forms (98:33 - 98:37)
randomly determined within pokemon go (98:34 - 98:39)
the final evolution is generally (98:37 - 98:41)
available in the wild in pokemon go (98:39 - 98:43)
but the form you will see depends on (98:41 - 98:45)
weather conditions at the time of (98:43 - 98:46)
capture (98:45 - 98:49)
you cannot alternate the forms within (98:46 - 98:50)
pokemon go (98:49 - 98:54)
there you go not too hard not too easy (98:50 - 98:56)
pokemon go players put your thinking (98:54 - 98:58)
caps on (98:56 - 99:02)
uh i forgot to say at the somewhere (98:58 - 99:03)
earlier in the episode (99:02 - 99:05)
uh there was an issue with apple (99:03 - 99:08)
podcasts last week (99:05 - 99:10)
nothing i can do here we've talked about (99:08 - 99:12)
this before there was an issue on (99:10 - 99:13)
spotify like (99:12 - 99:16)
three months ago this is what i will say (99:13 - 99:17)
though (99:16 - 99:19)
because you if you made it to the end (99:17 - 99:21)
you're obviously a hardcore fan (99:19 - 99:23)
thank you for making it but let me tell (99:21 - 99:27)
you let me tell you the details here (99:23 - 99:29)
i don't expect anyone to understand how (99:27 - 99:31)
podcasts work (99:29 - 99:33)
but it's it's it's really (99:31 - 99:34)
straightforward on my (99:33 - 99:38)
wild west i upload the podcast only once (99:34 - 99:41)
i edit it well i technically upload it (99:38 - 99:42)
three times but that's because we have a (99:41 - 99:43)
premium (99:42 - 99:45)
feed and whatnot anyways i edit the (99:43 - 99:46)
podcast (99:45 - 99:49)
i hit the upload button and once it goes (99:46 - 99:51)
on to the rss feed (99:49 - 99:54)
it goes everywhere we have where our (99:51 - 99:56)
show is available on 200 different (99:54 - 99:57)
podcast apps (99:56 - 100:00)
spotify stitcher apple podcast (99:57 - 100:04)
uh pocketcast overcast (100:00 - 100:08)
you name it podbean we're there (100:04 - 100:11)
think of 185 other podcast apps or there (100:08 - 100:15)
i don't specifically ever and no (100:11 - 100:16)
podcaster does (100:15 - 100:18)
upload specifically to spotify or (100:16 - 100:20)
specifically to stitcher (100:18 - 100:23)
that's just not how podcasting works so (100:20 - 100:24)
when a (100:23 - 100:27)
when it doesn't appear on your favorite (100:24 - 100:28)
service (100:27 - 100:31)
i assure you that i didn't forget (100:28 - 100:34)
to upload it to that service because i (100:31 - 100:35)
just that doesn't happen (100:34 - 100:38)
yeah but this is what i can it this is (100:35 - 100:40)
what i can guarantee (100:38 - 100:44)
if i got hit by a bus on sunday night (100:40 - 100:47)
while in my last dying breath i will (100:44 - 100:48)
text will (100:47 - 100:50)
and i will say make sure that monday's (100:48 - 100:53)
episode gets published and it will (100:50 - 100:55)
it will get public it gets published (100:53 - 100:56)
every (100:55 - 100:59)
monday morning at 6 a.m central time no (100:56 - 101:01)
matter what (100:59 - 101:04)
so if it is 6 10 am and you're like (101:01 - 101:07)
where is my podcast (101:04 - 101:11)
i it is it is undoubtedly your app (101:07 - 101:13)
and not me because when i'm crushed (101:11 - 101:14)
underneath that bus (101:13 - 101:16)
i will make sure i hit that upload (101:14 - 101:19)
button or will hits that upload button (101:16 - 101:22)
um so the (101:19 - 101:24)
the other way you can test that is if (101:22 - 101:25)
you just go to our website (101:24 - 101:27)
pokemonpodcast.com the if the episode is (101:25 - 101:28)
there (101:27 - 101:29)
on the website and it's not in your (101:28 - 101:31)
favorite podcast app like stitcher (101:29 - 101:33)
there's probably an issue with stitcher (101:31 - 101:34)
there's not a lot i can do to (101:33 - 101:35)
specifically (101:34 - 101:39)
fix that but apple podcast has had a lot (101:35 - 101:40)
of issues in the last (101:39 - 101:42)
week specifically because they were (101:40 - 101:44)
supposed to release their premium (101:42 - 101:45)
podcast episodes (101:44 - 101:48)
on june 15th and that never happened (101:45 - 101:49)
like i (101:48 - 101:51)
uploaded the premium podcast for apple (101:49 - 101:53)
podcast and that button (101:51 - 101:55)
doesn't even appear for listeners yet (101:53 - 101:57)
i've done everything they said they were (101:55 - 101:59)
going to do (101:57 - 101:59)
and for some people the episode popped (101:59 - 102:03)
up in apple podcasts some people it (102:01 - 102:03)
didn't (102:03 - 102:05)
i did get a couple tweets being like (102:03 - 102:07)
where's did you forget to upload apple (102:05 - 102:09)
podcast no i didn't apple podcast is (102:07 - 102:10)
just (102:09 - 102:14)
broken this week but like i said (102:10 - 102:17)
i promise you 6 a.m central time (102:14 - 102:19)
every monday the episode will be there (102:17 - 102:21)
and if it's not there (102:19 - 102:24)
it might be your podcast app uh unless (102:21 - 102:28)
suddenly i go missing but i don't (102:24 - 102:30)
even if i go missing we'll will we'll (102:28 - 102:31)
make sure the pocket is (102:30 - 102:34)
correct that's like one of the most (102:31 - 102:35)
important things ever (102:34 - 102:37)
is that consistency of making sure the (102:35 - 102:39)
episode goes up hopefully it's fixed (102:37 - 102:40)
this week (102:39 - 102:44)
um let me know you know i i think if it (102:40 - 102:45)
if it doesn't show up in apple podcast (102:44 - 102:47)
right away i'm sure i will hear on (102:45 - 102:48)
twitter or whatnot but (102:47 - 102:51)
um like i said i promise you every (102:48 - 102:53)
monday 6 a.m central time the episode (102:51 - 102:56)
