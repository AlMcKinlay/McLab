[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 600 467. yeah we jumped ahead welcome to the future oh we got to 600 oh boy hopefully this show would be significantly better um hi i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello uh i have been hunting the golden beaver to no success i'm very sad that no golden beavers have shown up in my home or near me i actually even put on an incense while at brunch today in attempt to attract the golden beaver and it did not happen the plump mouse pokemon yes whale is here well now i'm checking to see if i have a golden beaver but while i do that let me uh i certainly do not um i still have that shiny genesect though i need to inform our listeners that knitting time is no longer solely restricted to pokemon masters talk we're doing it through the whole program now has that been not enough masters talk you need to exactly yeah and this this blanket's not gonna knit itself so are you making me a blanket that's one no no no no no thanks this is my retirement blanket for when i get my chair with the georgetown seal on it it's a blue and gray blanket that she'll drape over the chair and i shall point at it when people come to visit and say that's my retirement chair do you want to be buried in it no okay i have uh two b doof in the house none are golden i got skinny hold on no no shiny i wanted my cashew butter uh okay so we have a pokemon show for y'all today uh we'll see how far will makes it on his blanket for the video people we got some pokemon go drama i'm already exhausted we're going to put that for a little bit later uh is there anything else what else do we got there's a whole bunch of 25th anniversary announcements there was there was one that we can cover uh that's also a headache so we'll put that for later let's start off with the fun news this what are we gonna start with available at build-a-bear no we already covered that pokemon company settles pokemon sword and shield lawsuit that's a banger to start off with i mean did people sue over the pokedex they were uh this was the leakers they were suing leakers uh i have it off polygon.com the pokemon company has settled its november 2019 lawsuit can you believe sword and shield's almost two years old uh against two sword and shield leakers according to court documents filed on tuesday the company filed the lawsuit in 2019 after photos of an unrelease of unreleased pokemon sword and shield strategy guide were published online before the game's release date i remember looking at these pictures the defendants are required to pay the pokemon company and fifty thousand dollars each in damages and attorney fees when the pokemon company first filed the lawsuit um i thought it was nintendo that technically filed it but uh it only had screenshots of the guides posted through a discord chat throughout the lot we made sure those pictures were not in our discord chat i'll tell you that much uh throughout that the lawsuit the pokemon company discovered that one of the two defendants took the photos while employed by the company that was hired to print the strategy guide the second defendant uh then shared those photos on discord uh from where they spread to a worldwide audience the pokemon company said in the original complaint photos revealed the photos revealed features that were never before seen like gigantomax forms of certain pokemon that's true i think that's when we found out about uh hatchery for the first time yeah oh and kingler because people lost their but the kingler stuff was cool uh pokemon company said in its complaint that it reacted swiftly to the leaks including issuing takedowns across the internet these weren't the only leaks however before and after those images were online a portuguese website published a series of leaks uh that have since got blacklisted by nintendo we covered that too i completely forgot about that yeah yeah the whole website because they like gosh what was their name too they had a pretty uh we were we were obsessed with the name i look this was i don't remember yeah yeah don't ask i don't know i don't remember what we even said on last week's show anyways uh that was that's pretty much it the the two people who leaked i have to pay 150 000 i'm sure they don't have that money i'm sure what it's like the legal process you can just file for bankruptcy and then move on with life not quite possibly go to jail yeah i mean you can file for bankruptcy and they can't come after you for the money but it ruins every a lot of other things so like there's no good way around it i mean they if you really want to know they come after everything you own yeah you're forced to sell everything that you own until you can pay them back i don't i don't know the i don't know if there's any lawyers that listen to the show or i'm sure there are i know at least one lawyer that listens to this program the i'm just curious how they get to that price 150 000 like how does how is that number decided uh there are existing instruments that will tell you like based on reach and reputation damage what the financial i mean i in bringing the case to court the pokemon company's lawyers will have identified this is what we see as the amount of financial damage that was caused to us by the actions of this malfeasar that's that's part of taking something to court you don't say well they did something bad to me make them pay no you say they did something bad to me make them pay this much 2 million in damages i the the the like goal i guess also is to probably scare people not to leak these again but i feel like most people that leak are like the they won't catch me no so so it's it kind of goes along the line with uh the concept of trademark where if you don't put forth the energy to stop people from doing something then it's an indication that you do not care whether they do or do not do that thing so you do have to go after a when it hits a certain level of notability you you have to go after it yeah i mean the threat of lawsuit was had always been there right like that has always been a thing like we you know we're going to go after leakers we're going to take them down so i think this is the first time i think you know where they've actually posted the results and the amount of money and i think that's just with more notoriety i think a lot of these things would have just been in court documents and people have been like i'm sure that it got taken care of but you know it's just it was fairly big news at the time so it's big news now and they went and looked it up i i saw like one or two comments that was like i'm glad they leaked it because it prevented me from buying the game and i couldn't help think my to myself like you would have solved the game anyway yeah uh there's there's financial damages right there yeah like i don't understand the thought process like were you ready to buy the game day one without looking at it if you were already on the fence why wouldn't you just wait wait like ceremony would have had everything within three days and they did so just like wait two hours after the game came out we don't live in a culture of weight now come on all right some 25th anniversary news this is like both cool and a bummer at the same time uh celebrate some of these off pokemon.com celebrate some of pokemon's greatest memories over 25 years of adventure discover and 25 years of adventure discovery and friendship the celebration expansion offers plenty to be excited about including an opportunity to scroll down memory lane with classic tcg cards are add a joyous parade of legendary mythical and beloved pokemon to your collection including mew ho zamasunta flying pikachu and surfing pikachu join the party with tcg celebration expansion that is going to come out october 8th 2021 uh they will have 45 more than 45 cards they say it's a 46 yeah so not 50. otherwise it's definitely not 50. uh it comes with four pokemon v-max sorry four pokemon v two pokemon v-max 25 classic cards and there will not be booster packs so this is a special set like shining fates was so shiny fates came out the week of the 25th pokemon day sorry um usually they do one of these sets this is their they're doing two this year uh there will be a dragapalt prime so this is the cool thing about this set uh they're taking gimmicks from older games so prime was a gimmick in like the heart gold soul silver era there was a very popular yen mega prime that was really good so they're taking a new car a new pokemon like dragopal they're making a prime version um they're doing lance's charizard v and then dark sylveon v that's cool because gym leaders was a gimmick dark pokemon were a gimmick uh there will be a pin collection there will there will be an elite trainer box there will be mini tens there will be a pikachu v union um that's there's our v union stuff we covered uh there will be a pikachu v-max and there will be an ultra premium collection and there will be a collector's chest those are all the different products coming out to celebrate these 45 cards yet there are 30 different boxes you could possibly buy maybe not buy because they're probably going to be all sold out and possible to find because there's charizards in these sets and there's pikachus in these sets and if we've learned anything in 2020 and 2021 it's that charizard and pikachu on cardboard sell very well uh it's not cardboard it's card stock my mistake oh wow wow i was there for that i was watching your stream it's like a bummer because uh i feel like the tcg has gotten better i know some people are like they still can't get tcg stuff in their area my targets in the milwaukee area remind to just don't need to bring it up every week but we were the target that had the gun pulled out and then all the carts were pulled since then that same target and the target near it has been flourishing with pokemon cards fully restocked no baseball cards uh but it was you come in you can buy two sets they had uh i took a vid i posted a video on instagram about it they had like 20 etbs of shining fates they had all the new battletons for chilling rains or sorry battle styles they had blisters and regular boosters of chilling rains they were loaded very stocked so at least targets in milwaukee have been very good with the cards and i think they will probably continue to be good until we get to celebrations where this will happen they will get although it's not like i remember when shining legends came out shining fates hidden fates like make champions path like these sets are always hard to find regardless of what they put into it because they're limited but i don't know maybe they'll learn their lesson on the print more than enough to no no no no no no not going to happen no no no no no no that's not a thing i mean so what's this what's the downside what's the sadness what's oh the sadness is cards are gonna be hard to find because of this oh right people want that little charizards they want them charizards are we gonna move over to pokemon center.com there's is there new stuff yeah i mean how are you not how are you not on the fence about getting all of the relaxing river figures oh no no no no i do both of you no you it's an invitation to disappointment is all that is don't do it i will say this the most recent celebration parade a toasty treat surprise figure makes me so happy i did not invest into this entire thing because this one you done charchick bad chick is projectile vomiting upon chimchar it is a bad luck it is so bad ah i wish there was just an option to buy the whole parade like give me the whole set why you got that weird froakie booger you've got torchic yeah up chucking i'm checking why do you want it eating too many uh nacho doritos and spewing on chimchar all owning that parade set is it's an invitation for your future children when your future home is infested by poltergeist the movie to turn into some horrible toy evil possessed creature that will torment them in the night you don't think the parade would would appreciate and value next time no it's no ancient mew it is never going to be an ancient view it's never going to be close to an ancient moon the only way that that parade is going to appreciate in value is in 10 years when some youtuber wants to make a video of why did the pokemon company ever make these products and you can't find a copy of it they're going to be like oh that's steve cerumi he had one he had let me reach out to him and offer him 50 bucks for the set old surumi up in surumi mansion surrounded by his pokemon valuables the so i so the the thing i wanted to collect was the was the pikachu moods yeah they sold out quick and the i got the first one which was like the sleepy mood or whatever and then the second one sold out and then this one sold out i think this is the third one the love mood yeah and i'm an all or nothing kind of person so since your second one sold out i've i've left that collection i'm done if i can't get them all i'm not interested you can get all the relaxing fake relaxing river figures though all of them right there but in a lot for sale the mood figures are resin and the relaxing river is resin and i think their resin quality is just bad it is but you can get all four of them i really want to like this nom blue polo shirt and i don't like that it's a white horizontal line across the front yeah that's bad by that it's not good but i am also who's wearing polos it's not it's not 2002 anymore greg what do you mean who is sporting a polo some of you must need business casual workwear are we are we still pretending that polo is like fist into the qualifications of business casual yes we do a a wedding casual summer allows for polo shirts polo shirts have a cute collar now whether or not you pop the collar that is a different thing we don't do that we don't do that now we don't we don't but polo shirts are still a viable shirt option they are they are their own thing and they can dress up a simple pair of jeans for when you're going out to a restaurant and you want to look better than the slubs around you like steve wandering with his galaxy rainbow plants for his ugly hoodie i don't think i've ever looked out of somebody wearing a polo and been like wow they really clasped it up over here well over over the dude in a tank top yeah they certainly did over some some edge lord in the corner with this chain wallet and hoodie yeah exactly this that that publisher has got buttons on it yeah it takes effort no one wearing a tank top or a chain wallet and a hoodie is trying to look classy the polo people are they made those choices and they made those choices to go out into the world and i respect like well i look more respected no no no buddy you put on a polo put out a button up maybe a tie maybe uh a blazer you're wrong you're living in this whole black and white world of it's either trash or it's class no there's something called decent yeah i wanted to look i wanted to look decent therefore i wore an underwear shirt and a potato i wanted to be comfortable i'm not going i'm not going to halfway try to like pretend you're halfway most things in your life no no no no like i went out i i i went out to a restaurant beginning of june i had a gift card tires went to it went to a steak place we had to use the gift card i put on a suit do you know why because i wanted to look good i wanted to feel good you know what you don't get with a polo you don't look any better and you don't feel any better polo no just just class it up put that suit on i am not wearing a tie i am not putting some horrible thing around my neck it is awful of course i cannot go out for a lovely evening at the bachelor farmer because it doesn't exist anymore but let's be hypothetical travel back in time i cannot go out for a lovely evening at the bachelor park farmer with greg and his husband and and throw back some drinks and have some laughs and good time in a suit correct but in a for going to your corporate job that you only go went to because you sold your soul yeah and you've got no nothing you're an empty husk of a human being so right might as well decorate that husk with a floored tire do you know what i think is classier than a polo a turtleneck [Music] what is wrong with you this is dead hickeys only turtlenecks are for ski wear for being out in the cold a turtleneck says i want to be steve jobs because i don't understand what that means and i want to pretend that i'm somehow cool so i'm going to wear a black turtleneck and be like an uber geek there is nothing classy about a a black turtle like this the 70 the time travel police from the 70s are coming to get you and drag you back to the era where you belong and your tennis sweater and just be done with it if i was at like an old country buffet and there was a table there was a table with a dude sitting with a with a polo on and a table with a dude sitting with a turtleneck on i bet you that turtleneck guy is ten times fancier than the pokemon that guy does things in his home that we can't talk about on this car also i bet you that turtleneck guides a thousand years old i mean i i cannot lie i used to own turtlenecks i used to rock turtlenecks under my sweaters yes yes six yes when that was appropriate or when you're out on the ski slopes having a rich day in the mountains i mean you may not understand this as a millennial will and greg but turtlenecks are not attractive they aren't turtlenecks i look at a dude wearing a turtleneck and i say thank you for letting me know ahead of time that i do not want to date you yes because what are you what are your writings in life what are you hiding under there what what hideous things are being covered up open up that open up that polo collar let me see them sweet clean neckline something those neck tendons you gotta expose the neck maybe we do need to do a public service announcement to our listeners who are like i'm trying to get dates and i can't get any dates and it's like hey buddy if you're wearing the turtleneck neck and you're going to arby's get get lost that's part of the reason why you're not getting any dates yeah friends ditch the turtlenecks that being said i cannot commit to these relaxing river figures what they just i what it meets your requirements i can get them all true yep it has my boy pikachu true yeah it's got psyduck as a floaty it's all the starters from kanto because you're a gen oner their limited release they probably only made certain amount of these and then they'll be gone forever clearly other people feel the same that i feel of these because they haven't sold out yet um can we talk about the 55 grill set yeah does it include a better dish like it kind of looks like are you getting the 25 st stemless glasses the 25th anniversary no i have way too many glasses okay all right let's just have a barbecue like if there's one thing i don't need anymore it's cups like i just ain't got room for them yeah i need less cups honestly all right well start breaking things irene did a crime in our house of throwing away our hotbox pizza cups because we had them that god that is a crap that i mean so it's an actual crime i was collecting so many of you you're filing for a divorce it's it was a short-lived marriage very sorry greg remind me of this the next time that irene asked us for consultations about appearance changing factors yeah we will say i have no truck with folks who throw away the hot box cup uh i just gotta respond excuse me hot box cups no no this is over we're done uh greg are you getting the egg incubator bag so you can put a plush frazilia in it so when you walk around on go fest no people know that you got the roselia in the bag that was a very long about it there's a long thing that that should have stopped when i said no all along it and then you still went for the bad ending which is still a no i don't want to carry a bag around a plastic bag in the middle of the summer on my carrying your child it's not my child i didn't give birth to it it doesn't talk to me it's sealed i'm gonna carry yeah i'll carry a sealed plastic bag with rosalia stuck in there like some some trophy pokemon no are you are you gonna get it and stuff all of 10 foot meowth in there no because i'll probably have like a stream backpack on and that'll what if they require that oh wait that doesn't require you to have the bag no no they require that you have a clear backpack like they've done in the past i'm like but it's not going to be this year that'll be next year i mean if there's a if there was a clear backpack requirement then i'd probably get it uh okay so fifty four dollars for barbecue tool set that is not worth it okay it's clear this year if there's anything the 25 25th anniversary has proven it's that the pokemon company is out of ideas another company that has a catalog of items and they flip through said catalog and they point at things and they say put pikachu on it and then we put it up on the website case in point this grill collection which is like look i ca they got like five pictures on the website it's kind of hard to gauge but it looks like so they they have a they have a the a porker the two prong thing i don't know what to call i don't call it a porker yeah it's like a big fork it's a grilling fork but where do you get porker from because you could like pork you pork pork pork it has just it it is like the standard thing you would probably find at walmart for 20 bucks yeah and they just put a very small stencil pikachu on the on the bottom yes and then they got the tongs and then they got the uh spatulas the tongs no the most important thing is the apron that's that's what all the polka dads are out to get but it's not in the set it says pokemon summer days grilling apron it's just a different item the airport's like 35 bucks on its own just get the apron i got look i i want to buy useless i want to buy a pikachu butter dish i want to buy things like this but i feel like the summer day grilling set three pack for almost sixty dollars there wasn't a lot of thought put into that here's the problem i want to believe it's good quality do we do we know what date that this was added to it was added on tuesday yeah okay so they obviously missed the mark because there are three things that exist in this world dads who like to grill and children who don't know what to get their father for father's day yes i mean dads who like pokemon who like to grill and children who don't know what to get their father for father's day this would have been the perfect if i had made the mistake and had children i would have probably gotten this if you if you are serious about grilling you probably have like 80 dollar tongs that have you significantly better of the united states of america this is uh for for our worldwide listeners welcome to folks from india to saskatchewan for america and it is men men enjoy grilling with zero skill but they are adamant that they are going to grill so no no one is a grilling enthusiast and investing heavily in the except for the the actual what is that machine that you cook on the actual grill grill the grill the grill they will spend like ten thousand dollars yeah just so that they have a better grill than their buddy but the actual tongs no no no no i went to home depot got two pieces of metal and put a spring between them that shows you what kind of a man i am right there i made my own tongs this is this is a set that you put into a frame and hang on the wall and never dirty them i can't wait for all the angry grill enthusiast letters we skipping the fact that it looks like at the end of both the spatula and the grilling fork that looks like a bottle opener i think it maybe but i thought it was just a hang them up on the side of the grill i mean but they could probably open bottles they got that lip for the bottle opener right there they got that lip in them i i'm sure by the end of the year we'll figure out exactly what catalog they're open they're ordering from oh yeah this is the same catalog harley davidson is using same exact spatula said it's just that they threw the harley logo on the bottom brandedcontent.com for all your branded content needs i don't know what factory in india i'm almost positive the resin figures are being made in india uh i think i think that's what that's china in their thing yeah but when i got um when i got the sleepy one there i and then i think the pikachu salt and pepper shaker i think they say um india on the boxes so there's lies on this website could be manufactured in china packaged in india this could be something that can happen i'm just not sold on any of their resin figures maybe they need a different factory or quality control a better resin scientist yes okay let's take a break uh when we come back we got some pokemon go stuff and yeah we got the some plans for go fest and some uh outrage and some other stuff so we will be right back what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a mix of porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales jackalope probably a horse and hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales jackalope probably a horse yeah but then like but then what are like what but then what is the nidoran supposed to be a porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whale jackalope probably a horse an hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whale jackalope probably a horse the hamster [Music] and we are back from our break uh shout out to brandon from our slack for sending in the lawsuit stuff um tone for sending in the celebration stuff and alex for sending in the pogo stuff let's talk about the pogo news before we get to the pogo drama okay so they updated the raid stuff and they announced that ray day will feature every legendary pokemon discovered in pokemon go so far so let's start there raid day or the second day of go fest the second day of go fest is called okay thank you it says trainers we have received reports that every legendary pokemon discovered in pokemon go will be appearing in five star raids strange right this sort of event hasn't happened in the world of pokemon go before so we're just as puzzled as you hopefully we'll get answers during the event to why that is happening there's your story um there was a story for why team rocket took over go fast last time i'm sure no one read it they just probably clicked all through it and i mean i did it i don't remember it from sunday july 18th from 10 to six legendary pokemon will appear globally in five star raids each pokemon will be appearing during one of four themed raid hours during the event so from 10 to 11 and from two to three mewtwo ho latias latios reggie gigas altered form geratina cresselia varisian and therian form tornadus will appear in lava hour from 11 to 12 or three to four multris entei reggie rock groudon heatran reshram turakian and therian form landorus this is a mouthful and eva tall will appear in five star raids from frost hour 12 to 1 or 4 to five articuno suicune lugia regis kyogre palkia kirum will appear plus ooxy mess spirit and as off will appear in the regions they normally appear in and then finally during thunder hour from one to two or five to six zapdos riku uh riko uh riko reggie steele rayquaza dialga kobelian therian formed thundurus zekrom and xerneas will appear in five star raids mythical pokemon will not be appearing in five star raids you'll get 10 raid passes that can be used in person 10 000 bonus xp uh completing timed research will give you up to eight remote raid passes and then there will be a bundle that will contain three remote raid passes that will be available in the shop that day as well and tickets available now so they don't really mention are the ones that have previously been shiny can they still be shiny in this event or is it a non-shiny event i would assume that they wouldn't turn off shinies yeah i would assume the same shinyan is shining on yeah but we have been in shiny off times before usually accidents yeah but they don't specifically say which makes me concerned although the problem i guess okay so people people really want shiny dialga and palkia so you could maybe be like are they going to turn those shiny i feel like zekrom and xerneas and evital and the other one resharam those are still like too new but i guess i could turn those shiny as well i mean whatever maybe they'll do whatever they want you're in a weird situation because like whether or not they turn on chinese if you're at like mall of america let's just say we're at mall of america there's seven gyms and rush around pops and it can't be shiny what are you gonna do are you gonna be like i'm not gonna do this raid that i can access at any point in this mall and just ignore it or yeah you're just gonna like wait 30 minutes for it to despawn and for the next one to pop up well i mean hopefully the uh there the other ones that you want are at the other gyms right so like you can pick and choose which ones you're going for yeah but there there's going to be like let's let's the dichotomy of pokemon go trainers there's so so when the they announced this i i the first thing i thought of was my sister who um she's like level 32 or whatever she's been playing since day one she plays with her kids a lot she never does community days she never does like these events like b doof but she will always do like a go fest or like a big ticketed event and i remember last year her biggest disappointment with go fest was she didn't get enough legendary pokemon and the year before that she was disappointed with day one because she was hoping she would get a legendary pokemon which the legendary pokemon for gofest were saved for day two that was like the shadow lugia shadow moltres zapdos articuno and the mewtwo um or was that all last year i don't remember one of those last year but once she got the legend she was like happy because she doesn't have a lot of people to raid with so doing these events like and getting legendary pokemon are excited for her exciting for her so i would imagine that if somebody just started playing go during the pandemic or somebody you know hasn't been playing go since day one this is a great opportunity for them to get a lot of pokemon that they are missing because like us three we probably we probably got like reggie rock regis and reggie steele the first time and then when they came back the second time we were like oh we don't care and then they came back as shiny and i wanted the shiny you guys didn't care no and then now they're coming back again for this event but i don't like i don't care right i already have enough of them and i already have them as shiny so i feel like they're the you have a lot of people being vocal being like ugh i already have a lot of these but yeah you correct you do correct you've been playing for five years of course you do uh but i would assume that niantic and pokemon are not dumb and the majority of players do not have every single legend and for five dollars you get access to this event they make a big deal about it they force everyone to play it's going to be very easy to get these legends everyone to play yep well you could be like will and spend the money and not play yeah yeah correct so i i think event wise i think it's a good event i think it's a good event i mean it's a five-year catch-up let's do everything event right like it's uh everything is back it's a new players and old players it's a nostalgia for pokemon go which is weird to say but it is five years so whatever i it boggles my mind to some extent when people who have played the game for years are upset that events come back well i actually look at it a little differently i look at it at this as uh pokemon go saying hey buddy you know how you give up every whatever tuesday night how you take off time from work and you're so obsessed and like on tuesday nights you drive around to literally 30 raids within the raid hour so that you can do absolutely every single one so not only can you get the shiny but you can get the shiny with the highest stats and everything they're like dude chill chill this is your time to relax you've been you've but no no no like there it's like we are casting judgment on how you have been playing this game we did not intend for you to be so obsessed you should relax because guess what we always bring it back around we always bring it back always bring it back around so you didn't need to give up so much of your life for this so you have a player like my sister which is probably a lot of people you know they're missing legendary pokemon they don't get to do raids that often they do do these big events they will probably do they will probably focus on the ones they're missing to fill out their pokedex um then you have like the battler people who they need a good restaurant they need to do the good zekrom they they will ignore every reggie rock and he well he trends actually pretty okay verizion they will ignore those because they're looking for whatever for go battle league or for raid carries and then i feel like you have players like me which unfortunately that turns into greg and will where oh we're doing every one that we can because we're already here yeah so we're going to make the most of our time we've already we've already sunk the five dollars in and we've all we already bought raid passes so we might as well instead of waiting for the next 30 minutes we might as well just do this one yeah hatred better be okay your entire bachelor party was a lie yeah yeah i think it's cool the the i mean the problem is like your location are you in an area that has 10 raids and if you're not in an area that has 10 raids do you have access to a discord or unfortunately a facebook group where your other people can say look i got the giratina and you're like oh thank goodness i only got uh thundurus over here and you can join in it also like seems i i did i did ask niantic this and they said further details will be revealed which the further details are you get all these raid passes because my thought process is well if you are charging five dollars for an event and you're saying day two of the event is raid focused [Music] how do you want your players to play the eight-hour event for raids when raids cost money they want you to spend money on rate classes like how do you envision that working and they're they're they said well we'll get free raid passes we'll talk about that at a later date here's that later date so 10 local raid passes plus technically you're one free one so 11. eight remote raid and three more remote raids so that's 22 raid passes in eight hours i i guess that's like probably what maybe normal people that's great yeah i'm trying to think of like raid trains when they do like the wednesday night thing where they boost it and i feel like if you have a really good group you could probably do like 10 of them feel like a slow group you maybe do like six yeah but that's in one hour yeah oh i okay i was thinking of more like the when we used to do the um like the saturdays and they would have like the they did the canton and everything and like those raid trains would be doing 30 or 40. because they they go in you start the raid you start walking towards the next one you don't want these yeah yeah but in the sense of like needing to remote in that that is just more time consuming you can't like when you're in person and you're doing a ray train and you have like 20 of you and you all jump in and then you start doing it then you start walking to the next one it's very easy to coordinate yeah so that's why you can do so many but you can't use remote rate classes locally uh yeah can you yeah yeah there's a gym down the street from my house and if i see something good in there i it's too far for me to be a local yeah but if you are if you are like if we're in mall of america and we are standing next to the thing can you choose to use a remote raid pass instead of a regular raid pass oh no i think you have to be out of the circle so really well then you just walk to the other side of the wall yeah you just walk yeah make them all remote i i would assume for like a normal person 20 some raid passes is enough because i'm also assuming that person is probably not going to play all eight hours right and if they are going to play all eight hours they probably have no problem spending more money they might complain about spending more money but look it's the big event the one big event of the year for this game that you're so obsessed with save save up a little bit to splurge on the go fast i'm just trying to lay out what that day looks like for both sides of like casual and hardcore uh like for me i would i for me though my thought process is like i don't care about regis i don't care about lugia i don't care about entei i don't care about suicune like i do want to do palkias and kirums and reshrams but again we're going to be at a place with seven gems and i'm sure and at least during the canto tour they were also they were spawning for like 15 minutes and then rotating out so i so if all the gyms are regis i guess i could do the regis but i don't want to but then do i just wait 15 minutes it's not like we can't fill time yeah i know i know it's just it's like i don't think i have a virizion so there's some of the ones that i just don't oh i certainly have none of these except articuno which they gave me for free i think okay yeah it's it's it will be an interesting event and just started coordinating what everybody wants and needs to get from it oh and can we also remind folks it's the opposite of our previous uh scold warning and annotation if i'm set to not online on pokemon go please do not invite me to six raids the real question is which mega are you gonna be running well i only have one so it'll be that one none drill low honey oh you have low funny nobody's good get that fighting bonus not run in any of them i don't think you get the bonus candy i i don't care about the candy i got so much candy i have candy coming out my ears not of ziaga you need that bonus diagram oh i'll get one what am i going to do yeah what am i going to do with dialga candy power i don't power up pokemon invest back in no the night before go fest well we're going to power up you some pokemon so we could we no so then i might accidentally finish one of these research tests that is very bad uh the other the other pokemon go live.com together uh we raid a summer of celebrations of raid battles uh raid battles will see the following updates trainer achievements complete certain amount of actions during a raid you will be featured afterwards art and user experience raids will look better than other uh better than ever various quality of life updates uh trainer achievements have been added for example at the conclusion of a raid trainers who dealt the most damage or used a mega mega evolved pokemon will be able to showcase for being a valuable participant here are some of the trainer achievements you can earn delivering final attack dealing most damage keeping a single pokemon alive in battle for the longest using the tallest pokemon joining from the furthest right distance using mega evolved pokemon changing your avatar's clothing or post using most charged attacks uh the first time you earn a trainer achievement you will receive a medal that you can level up from bronze silver and finally to gold you can even download your trainer achievement card featuring your avatar to share with your friends on social media nice and then the art and ux will be updated i think you can maybe already see that in game if you click on like a team instinct it's like yellow with these black slashy lines and then if it's mystic it's blue wait when did these um these special whatever achievement when did that start did that start already yeah it started on like thursday night okay because i was doing uh raid this morning don't ask me why it just happened it it happened sometimes i was doing it alone and when i finished killing that poor little timber i got a pop-up on my screen that said you dealt the last blow yeah i was like i also dealt the only blows what are you trying to tell me here was that was that one of these things yes okay this this is gonna be my psa for this because i saw some you know rumblings and and you know i'm on twitch a lot so i hear people's you know first impressions when they when these youtubers watch a lot i'm on twitch a lot and i think i think i i saw this in our slack in our discord of people maybe expressing their concerns of uh using the tallest pokemon in battle you know people might bring exeggutors just to get this or keeping a single pokemon longest in battle people might bring blissey to get this and that would encourage bad pokemon being brought to raids this is what i will say if those people really want those achievements let them have those achievements they are they they mean nothing and that's what that and that's fine it's like the sticker complaint where people are like these stickers are so useless what am i supposed to do with them nothing they're just fun have you ever received an actual postcard in the mail and somebody slapped a sticker on it and you're like why did they stack slap a sticker on it because they're trying to make an enjoyable thing that means nothing you'll look at it for one day and then you'll throw it in the trash and then you'll never these are just fun things if somebody at the end of the raid goes wow my pokemon was the tallest they're not going to remember it in 10 minutes it's whatever it's just a fun dumb thing and if somebody really wants to always have the tallest pokemon amongst everyone in battle let them have it it's fine it doesn't mean anything your raid might take five seconds longer because they're using a lowland executor or you may fail it's true you might fail it well if you fail it then they don't get the prize that's true so eventually everyone will learn their lesson yeah i i think it's fine though i i definitely there there has been games where at the end of the game uh monster hunter did this i think was monster hunter generations will where at the end of the hunt it would be like oh monster hunter world that was not generation oh it was world it was like oh you were the mount master or you you did the most you did the most damage or you did the most uh grapple king or like assist heels that kind of thing yeah but like no when i was when i was doing those hunts i never thought to myself oh i really need to be the the grap lock master like i just you just happen to get that at the end and you're like oh i guess i did grapple the most like it's just like a fun thing that popped up that you didn't really think about once you realize that all achievements are worthless you can just let it go and not care right i mean i don't think anyone is being like well i got 16 platinum trophies on the playstation network and then like quickly updating their linkedin to be like i mean you are but yeah but that's you know i'm stoned and trying to get sony though you know i'm trying to get sony to sponsor you greg the achievement of peace in your heart through quiet contemplation and meditation is a true great reward so not all achievements are worthless didn't give me a medal so [Laughter] uh community day will we doing it when is that saturday the third um i mean this is april it's possible what is it sunday no sunday's fourth of july buddy yes sunday's fourth of july saturday july 3rd from 11 to 5. we could do we could do some of that i do like me a ted pig and then we could get like uh pulled pork barbecue ooh should we come should i come down towards your area this time not the art park uh i do know some barbecue places we'll we'll discuss it we'll figure it out okay last one is the drama here uh this says trainers one of the delights of pokemon go is finding pokemon in the real world walking around discovering new places meeting up with groups of friends yeah like you guys were just planning i have been saying this since day one even before the game came out i remember myself saying it's pokemon in the real world steve stop hating on it yeah steve uh at the core niantic built the game around these ideals of exploration exercise and playing with friends as we said last month they bolded said uh which is weird how we all play has changed a lot in the past 15 months with uh the onset of the global pandemic we realized that we had to change the model for our game we could no longer take going outside and meeting people for granted we've learned a lot thank you for coming along as we navigate through this together today we will be moving towards recovery and we are announcing new exclu exploration bonuses that make it rewarding to play outside are coming over the next several months including bonuses for spinning spots playing in person raids and getting in those steps bonuses introduced last year we plan to change or remove and we will be first testing in the us and new zealand followed by other countries based on local conditions and they then said bonuses introduced last year we plan on keeping including first catch of the day go battle league and train our battle requirements we will only remove these bonuses after go fest 2021 starting in the united states and new zealand we wanted to give you advance heads up of what's coming and our thinking behind it as we said last november they bolded the word set again it's because it's a link to their updates which is just like so it's so passive aggressive whatever yeah but the problem is if they don't do it people will be like you lied and they're like no we didn't we said specifically here uh we are committed to doing this in a staggered way uh that makes sense for each place in the world to help people safely and then to return outside again these changes are aimed at the focus of pokemon go on movement and exploration in the real world these changes will slowly be introduced and carefully making it more uh make and more exciting to explore the world around you blah blah there's a lot fluff here okay new bonuses for playing in the real world there's a three-part step uh these will be first in the u.s and new zealand you will receive up to two free raid passes a day seems good it's a hundred percent more raid passes the benefit from increased incense effectiveness while moving around that makes sense incense should work better if you're moving in my opinion be guaranteed gifts when spinning a pokestop as long as you don't have maximum gifts in your inventory also good especially since i feel like people complained that it was hard to get gifts so they're saying if you have 19 gifts you spend that stop you're guaranteed that gift to get you to 20. and you will receive 10 times the bonus xp for spinning a pokestop the first time no i don't really care about that but whatever um bonuses introduced last year that we plan to remove or change uh over the last year these so the bonuses that they said here will end september 1. yes so they want they said i think they say this maybe at the end that they want bonuses to rotate out per season so just like seasons have the like for the seasons of legends you got bonus xp for doing raids and the one season there was something i don't remember what it was uh so they they do want to they said some bonuses they'll tweak some bonuses they'll change some bonuses won't go away new bonuses will come in bonuses we introduced last year that we plan to remove or change okay over the past year incense effectiveness was increased to attract pokemon to you more frequently even if you weren't able to leave at home after the change the effectiveness will be set at the standard level when you're stationary and increase effectiveness will kick in when you're moving we'll come back to that previously your buddy will bring you more gifts each day up to five gifts at once up to three times a day this was because we knew trainers were running low on supplies like pokeballs and berries to catch pokemon as we move to encouraging trainers to play outside they will continue to receive supplies spinning stops after the changes the frequency of these buddies will be reduced okay no one cares about this the buddies brought like two potions and one pokeball and that's only if you actually like paid attention to it like i don't think anyone cared about this change i disagree but okay did you rely on it yeah yeah like i i i never relied on it because my thing was always full yeah all the time like my bag was always full so i could never know there were no stops near me like that i was in my house the only way i was getting anything or gifts to send to friends was through my buddy when i was waiting this is different from your buddy going out to the poke stops and grabbing stuff this is the little thing that they wrap up in a leaf mm-hmm you have it doesn't give you much no i never did it was it was like one potion and one pokeball no i mean i've got i've gotten a lot from that little from that from that back i've gotten huge swaths of potions i feel like you i would get way more if there was an option of like i need i need pokeballs and i need stuff i would just open my i would just open my 30 gifts and i would be maxed that's that's what might like if you were like i'm out of stuff to do open your gifts like i don't even have time to open my gifts most again i'm i'm a hardcore player so but like the reason i don't end up opening 30 gifts a day is because i have to like 90 of my game is storage management so it's like i gotta delete berries i gotta leave pokeballs now i can open all 30 gifts but that also takes like 15 minutes to do so i'm just gonna skip it because i already got max items uh previously that's why you haven't opened my gifts i haven't opened your gifts either because i don't need your friendship bonuses pokestop and gym interaction distances were increased we were in we in a to enable people to engage from further away after this change the distance will revert back to the standard distance when it makes sense in different places though it may be increased during future events or past certain events okay so this what i just read here was what people were the most angry about so we'll come back to that remote raids have been an important part of the game in the past year and we're going to continue evolving them our intention is to find the rip right balance between remote play and in person play so stay tuned for more details many of these in-person raids changes will be in to prepare for the eventual return of ex rates hot take i love ex raids i hate ex raids i love them so much i love knowing that the ex raid is at 1 pm and when i will go there there will be other people there because we're all on a schedule and we do it and we leave i love it it's great the times and locations that they chose for the zx raids if you work a full-time job are not very conducive to that yeah but i hate that argument not everyone is nine to five though it's such a bad argument it's not a bad argument it's a realistic argument there are a ton of people in the bullying argument there's a ton of people who play this game yeah and there's a ton of people that are not nine to five there were pl i went to plenty of ex raids that were on saturdays and sundays i went to plenty ex raids that were after six o'clock yeah but not all of them are not all of them are at that time either if they're saying ex raids are i i don't care for them for that reason it it was a hit or mess whether you got it and it was a hit or miss if you got something that actually worked for you what is not my ideal way of doing raids what if they reintroduce them and say we'll assign you a time at first but if that time doesn't work for you then you can request to reschedule i will be cool i would like that or give you two options like we have uh we have a wednesday afternoon or we got a friday evening which one do you want yeah that would be cool that would that would be a better implementation implementation of ex rates i'm not a huge fan of ex rates bonuses introduced last year that we plan on keeping all right incense will remain at 60 minutes great perfect no more walking for go battle league i'm sure people were very excited about that you can challenge any trainer using a qr code and the requirement to battle with friends has been lowered to good friends which i think is seven days right yep uh maximum number of gifts you can carry will remain at 20 but you will be able to open up 30 gifts a day from the 20 before it was 20 and 20. you will continue to receive three times the stardust and xp for your first pokemon catch of the day i think most people don't even know that was a change because the pandemic they just but that was a change uh and then you can check out for further updates okay so that was all the changes this was very heated um specifically because of the one thing i will reread it the one thing that everyone seemed to actually really be upset about um although i'm sure you can find somebody that was upset about the buddy feature uh pokestop and gym distance were increased enabling people to engage from further away after this change the distance will revert back to the standard distance when it makes sense in different places though it may be increased for future events or past or part of a certain feature okay so the drama the drama drama drama uh here's the thing uh when this happened specifically this pokestop and gym distance uh people on twitter and reddit and in discord communities and on facebook i'm sure i don't go to facebook but i'm sure they were angry over there uh we're very angry about this change specifically and they were complaining to niantic on twitter but they also went to niantic's employees twitters to complain because they felt like niantic wasn't listening to them in this regard and specifically liz who some hardcore people might know is the head of social media for pokemon go for niantic in the united states now there is different managers for you know india korea japan and there are different managers for different games so like niantic has a media manager for ingress and for harry potter wizards unite liz specifically only deals with pokemon go i've worked with liz a ton of times she's incredible she's great uh and she has said for the last however many years that her twitter account is her personal twitter account she does not report on anything niantic official even in her little bio it says hey if you're having trouble with pokemon go sorry i cannot help you you must use at niantic support or whatever it is pokemon go support um but if people were like hey when is caterpie getting a cowboy hat she would be like hey i can't answer that but if you want to give feedback about the caterpie hat here is where you can go um and because people were so upset about the pokestop and gym in interaction distances were increased or now they're now they're decreasing they personally attacked liz on her personal twitter and she has deactivated her twitter she's now gone from twitter and we haven't heard it from her since and it is incredibly unfortunate and incredibly frustrating that at the end of the day this is just a video game and a lot of people like it but there is never there is a no situation where you need to harass a single niantic employee for a game that has decisions not made by her made by two global goliaths niantic in the pokemon company and her job is just to make sure that she gets that information out there the best she can right because like if she personally had a problem with something she ain't she isn't going to complain about it on her personal twitter she's going to use the pokemon go twitter to communicate what needs to be communicate the best that she can communicate it yep i just i don't understand because it's like this is a change that was made because of a change in the circumstances of the world the world is reverting back to what it some somewhat what it used to be so those changes are going to get reverted back this is i mean how things work i understand why people are frustrated with it i do too and i i get that that it there is no reason there's no real good reason to change it back like it helped a lot of people it helped in a lot of ways whether they intended it or not and they can sell more remote raid passes taking it away is a money move right like there there are business decisions not personal decisions why they made this change i don't agree with it i think they should have just left it because it really it helped a lot of people and they feel discounted what is the problem is that when they take that into personal attacks and drive an employee away it ultimately hurts what you're trying to get across because you did it in such a poor fashion that people can easily write you off and it is never ever ever ever ever okay to attack another human being for the decision that your company made there are a lot of things that my company does that i hate the amount of input they come to me for those day-to-day decisions is exactly zero uh you can be mad at me but that's fine i can't change them a single person doesn't deserve abuse because you're mad in the minute you can make the decision that yes niantic has made a very poor decision uh is one that you absolutely don't agree with and it's one that you can decide whether or not you wish to continue doing business with that company if they show no efforts to communicate you when you are trying to communicate reasonably when you become unreasonable it is easy for the company to ignore you it is easy for the company to point out to your poor behavior and write you off as a bad actor especially if you drive somebody off a social media platform it is a terrible decision that you made and you should just not do it it's not it is not right you don't want people attacking you don't attack other people it is incredibly frustrating when they do this and they do this about a million things in a million fandoms they have chased people off social media platforms just for the dumbest most frustrating reasons and people will point to that example as a way to discount your opinion for the rest of time because you proved yourself to be an ultimate jerk troll yep what's also interesting too is as part of this dynamic is that there are sufficient people who are like i play this game i don't put many any money into it right that then they can't say well i'm voting with my dollar i'm going to walk around way and not pay for this anymore so then they're like well then how can i affect change but of course you don't affect change by being a troll right so the frustrating thing too is like i feel like the people yelling at liz or other employees on niantic and there are look you can find the other niantic employees you can find the ones that are liz's boss or liz's boss's boss on twitter um but because liz has social media right in her job title and because liz is active on pogo uh or sorry active on twitter as like you know just somebody who was twitter a lot um i guess people decided to go to her but what these people don't understand and i'm assuming it's the people i i know for sure it's the people yelling at liz and as like i've talked with liz tons of times like i said i've worked with her and niantic on stuff uh i've always told you guys when you know if niantic pays for my event i let you guys know but she deeply cares about pokemon and pokemon go yep like she wants the game to be the best it can be and she maybe personally disagreed with the radius change but she can't say that on her personal twitter because that's not allowed and she behind the scenes could have been fighting to keep it and maybe we needed more time and to all those people that were like well she should have just communicated that that's not how it works on her personal twitter have you ever had any sort of corporate job yeah it's not how corporations work it's not how corporate jobs work you people get fired over what they put on their social media if it disparages the company if it goes against what their official statement is people will lose their job if it's even it's on the personal twitter and you think that personal twitter is locked away so they can't find it people even if for whatever crazy reason you were like oh well liz didn't listen to us or or liz didn't fight for us it's not like she's getting your raid dollars when you do like right yeah but also that's not her position in the company she's not making decisions about the architecture of the pro of the game right all she's doing is communicating what she's been given to communicate and i don't if you think if you think you are safe if you think oh she could have hide it on an alt account there are people that find all counts print out twitter and send it to the company to deliberately get them fired this is hap this happens multiple times this happens multiple ways people will ruin people's lives and jobs over these things so don't think like oh she could have coded it or she could have hid it or she could use a separate thing to let us all know if she's letting you know her bosses will find out and they will have grounds for termination the pokemon go community doesn't realize how great liz is like other games would love to have somebody who is so passionate about not only their product but the the brand itself which is pokemon right like liz both cared so much about pogo and wanting pogo to be the best game it can be but she also is a huge pokemon fan and was a huge pokemon fan before pogo was even a thing and have her driven off twitter because people are upset that their game is changing and like to me it's like yes this change sucks but you also played the game for over four years with it like this it's not like exactly yeah i mean like i get that it like there there is not i can't sit here and be like well they're they're changing it because of this because there's really not a good reason for them to change it but that's the saying like oh this is the way it was when you get an improved version for them to say well we're going to go back to the version that was bad is always going to taste bad yeah you know i played it i played it like this for four years and it was not great it was an irritant you finally fixed the irritant it's like saying i wasn't an errand but like it wasn't actually irritating it was for some people in remote locations people who have mobility problems there are multiple issues that feed into this it wasn't an issue to you like it's like saying i had thick socks on and never felt the pebble in my shoe it was great when you finally took it out and now you put another pebble on my shoe and i feel it again i don't feel it as bad it's still there but i can still walk there are people who couldn't play the game because of these restrictions and could once it got released there was things tied into this because it didn't affect you as bad it still isn't a reason that it's fine to go back to it yes i mean so people have i think people are rightly upset the going back going back to the way it was for not great reasons feels bad especially to people who found the game so much more playable who are now being told reverting back to a game that isn't as playable for you that does once again create an obstacle for you playing the game after 15 months of this and we're going back mostly it feels like for money it's a bad experience and it's one they didn't have to do but also fundamentally the only way that niantic is going to notice that this has had an impact on player base is from a change in income and we know they will see no change in income i don't get how this makes them more money because like people are can't reach a pokestop now so they're going to buy pokeballs and they're shopping yeah they'll buy pokeballs still get stuff they'll do raid passes that gym that was reachable from their from their house is now a remote raid pass because they can't get to it for whatever reason it does affect in minor ways how people have to interact with the game for not real great reasons going back to the way it was when the world isn't back to the way it was it it it's no i i agree with that like it feels not great across all levels i get why people are mad and for people who this really impacts like in rural areas people who are you know who have mobility issues these things do hurt and i i think we all sort of need to acknowledge the fact that there are a segment of players who these things really do hurt more than it affects us i can get my car and drive wherever i el i'll have to do it and it puts me out for some people it is a much harder burden for not a great reason and i think i think it's that sort of message of we're constantly monitoring and we're wandering our player base and we're invested to how you play the game and this is those two messages don't fit well together and that makes people very angry and i i understand that and i think that anger is valid i think your expression of anger is not necessarily the way that that should happen yes no like there there are plenty of minor changes that have driven me away from a game and the example i used on twitter was destiny like i put four years into destiny 1500 plus hours i played it with will and irene almost every single night like i was the person that was buying the 50 emblems because i wanted every single emblem in my game and destiny 2 changed such enough little things that it wasn't enjoyable for me anymore and they were pretty little things um and i just walked away from destiny i didn't find developers on twitter to tweet at i didn't make huge threads on reddit complaining i just moved on to a different game and there are plenty of games out there and if if these changes are frustrating enough to you i get it i get walking away from the game they are not frustrating enough for me because my vision of what pokemon go is is lined up with niantic's vision which is i want to go outside and i want to go explore and i want to spin stops and this was something like a friend i used to play go with a lot we always disagreed with because they didn't want to walk they wanted to get into their car and they wanted to drive to stop to stop and i would do that because like that's what they wanted to do and that was most comfortable for them but i hated playing go like that i wanted to be on my feet i wanted to walk from place to place and i i there is like a small i guess respect that i have for niantic to be like this is how we want people to play our game we want people to go outside we want people to walk we want them to explore new places go like i've never been over to that location i've never spun that pokestop i guess i'm gonna walk there for the first time i i have a respect for that of like this is how we want people to do that and i totally again i totally agree with people being like why decrease the pokestop distance what are you getting out of it i don't the thing is is i think i think they showed that they had great ideas of how to how to get people to play the game they want the game to be played right like there are bonuses for walking and all those things like they did they added those perks in so like you get a benefit if you play the game the way that they envision the game being played what's frustrating is is they also took took what feels like a punitive measure as well to say we also don't want you to play this way and that yeah that is not a great thing for a company to do no matter what like if you really want to encourage them to play a certain way encourage them but don't mandate them is i think really where some of the problem comes into and i'll say another thing like i just did that really well with weather by the way yes when they introduced weather they didn't want to discourage people in any way so when you're catching weather boosted pokemon you are getting rewarded for it so i think i think right they they figured it out and i feel like they nailed it the first time with weather and they don't get enough credit for that yeah uh but you're never you're you're only judged by your last success or failure uh the past doesn't matter i think uh i think it's okay to go express to the company of a game that you love that you hope they will change before you walk away i'm not telling people not to i think it's fine to go to a reddit to say this is my my thoughts i agree with this i think it's okay to write them a letter i think it's okay to reach out to them in email or on twitter in a respectful way to say here's what this does to me please understand and if after you have done that and they still don't listen then make your choice whether you can accept it or move on i don't want to come across like like like just pick up your pick up your bags and leave i mean that is absolutely an option that's the option i usually take like i don't i don't care enough about the state of your game and making you money for me to tell you how to fix your game so i'm just gonna walk there are a lot of people who are way more invested in things than i am and i would say yes make your make your opinion heard in a respectful calm manner because that is going to be taken a lot more seriously than driving somebody off of the internet because you are making death threats or a million other horrible things that people do i don't know if i have anything else i do if i ever saw anyone in our discords communities uh slacks if i saw you tweeting that kind of stuff at a pokemon employee niantic game freak you would be banned from our community instantly [Music] i don't want people in our communities harassing other employees because they are an unhappy of tree texture in sword and shield the trees do look bad we just stop would you stop stop that's right are fine they're fine they're subpar oh you're subject reality it's an art style the the problem the yeah the the problem is like niantic always seems to just drop the ball in communication they do they do they make decisions they tend to make decisions in a very narrow field and don't explain their narrat why they've chosen a narrow field like there's a lot of people who fall out and there's a lot of good reasons that like never seem to be addressed or considered in in the way they communicate and i think that adds to the frustration and this is across so many companies who who put things out and and and they're just like and that's the decision we made and we did all of this research and it's like two seconds you get to see all this and you didn't address it but but even even more than that fundamentally every corporation they will not ever say this to you right but there are customers and communities they care about there are customers and communities they don't care about and if you're in the set that they don't care about they don't care about you and they're not making decisions to benefit you done i think overall this press release was fine i think it was good it's fine i mean uh the i i think probably if the pokestop thing wasn't here most people would be like okay yeah we figured this was coming um we'll see what niantic does uh i guess you could maybe argue that they backtracked on mega stuff after people complained even though i think all the changes didn't make anyone feel better at all and like i said on the show i bet they would have done all of those changes anyways because everything in pogo is very hard up front a couple months pass slightly easier a year passes give it to everyone it's literally just a patience game with them um so i really don't think the complaints about mega evolution actually affected anything i think they just well i think they were going to do those changes anyways they just moved them up like two weeks question of the week all right question of the week hallelujah question of the week it's that time again it's not raining anywhere the sun came out greg it was raining earlier that's true uh it's the last podcast of pride so i guess we'll do this one uh steven says i would like to repost tone rings a wonderful question from two weeks ago that was not selected what pokemon and that sounds like stephen it certainly does well what pokemon would you pick to join i pride parade happy pride uh definitely not torchic after its behavior torchic has proven that it cannot handle pride events uh all right so sylveon naturally gardevoir of course floor just absolutely roserade rosalia 100 uh i could be convinced i'm bear tick like bear take a nursery are probably gonna be on their own float they're gonna represent the eagle walking down the parade for sure uh you know that the popular dance bar is going to have uh machamp on there because it's already in skimpy shorts and it already has shown in pokemon step that it knows how to dance and flex and people are always there for that uh there is going to be a section that has sandshrew in the workout gear from the anim from the anime because that is a community that always is at parade well yeah you're going to have like yeah like uh all the circuit queens machines absolutely is up in there oh yeah yeah um but naturally ho oh of course the rainbow of course pokemon uh xerneas will be a uh probably a grand marshal grand marshall grand marshall's ernest for sure do you have a pick you know greg really uh i went through that whole until he said bear take him it was all down the gutter chantry get in the pool oh oh oh oh uh whirlybirdie um i love whirly burly no you know what uh uh weasel weasel and floyd absolutely yeah the otters are always gonna be there oshawott yeah yeah asha what's there don't shake your head at me uh will pokemon of the week are we not sorry again the bear take comment really usually i'm so structured i just wasn't uh i i should ex expected the most detailed of answers from greg during that that's why i'm on the show uh what do we have for youtube youtube we can do mimic you you can come out from under the cloth this is a good one this is a good one this is from uh spade from our youtube who would you like to show up as a character on pokemon unite do you think we will see other pokemon like legends megas etc um they did say that the there will be legends that spawn in the center of the arena during matches uh i don't know what that looks like um they did say more characters are coming uh blastoise gardevoir and then question mark i mean i know we all know what i want that's easy i want i want my rose right family i want my sable i mean i want mama's wine oh mama swine yeah mama shine would be a great defender if i was gonna say a defender probably yeah some sort of bulky tanky thing um i would also put in bolton at like as a fast ass easter i think they call it yeah speedster rengar is a speedster i think yeah here's a here's a real hot take mill tank think of miltank rolling like roll out okay why because it like i don't know just the the visual on unite the visual of a cow rolling through a battlefield is just very it's very good yeah it could replenish its own health milk drink yeah i could see it as a support and then it has an ultimate roll through the entire like like kramer goes up and like grabs onto his utter and then also gets health back and you're you are shaking your head at me about the pride choices and you're gonna bring that into the conversation i want to see talonflame and pokemon unite i got what i wanted what if they added uh volcarona well you know i was actually thinking my honest answer was where are our moth slash butterfly based pokemon in this pro in this game i wouldn't want butterfree give me the venom off i mean okay fine can we get one of them though yeah we need our uh we need vivio vivillon volcarona yeah would be good valkyrie definitely not it's like like slowing them down the quiver dancing the string shot and yeah what about poison do we have any poisoners out there i guess gengar is gonna be uh yeah gengar is probably a poisoner because i think like scoloped might be kind of cool oh yeah sculpey would be great jeff would play skulloped for sure all right question of the week well welcome another week will oh sorry pokemon so last week's pokemon i don't think that i said it specifically but it is in a very unique category because of its weight so its weight affects how much damage or what the attack power of low kick and grass not are uh its weight impacts whether it has a modifier for getting caught by a heavy ball whether it can compete in fancy cup light cup and whether it can or cannot be taken into the air by skydrop here who even knew that if a pokemon is too heavy it can't be picked up by skydrop this was news to me uh and also its evolution is jeff's favorite pokemon and i feel justified in saying that since jeff was referenced as a potential member of team rush so there you go [Music] chata chat is eligible for fancy and light cup it's bergmite bergmite it's just because of that strange thing about its particular weight that it is the only pokemon that meets all of those criteria very strange and avalon is jeff's favorite yes have a log is well i mean may not be anymore i don't know at a time yeah yeah jeff's uh the shuffle icon is incredible because it's the entire pokemon oh it's a little guy have you guys hi i like the sh i do like the shiny i feel a little conflicted about the fact that it's yellow snow but well you know i said a little conflicted not majorly conflicted i mean is it snow or is it ice i mean we're splitting hairs at that point aren't we yeah yeah what about next week all right we have no there's literally no there's unfortunately here we go this is for all the pokemon go drama this is the pokemon go pokemon of the week i finally added this week's pokemon to my pokedex by completing a portion of a special research task that began on december 14 2020 it is not the final goal pokemon of the special research but only one you collect along the way after giving your buddy 10 treats jesse and james are no longer required for this special research this pokemon was a notable addition to my pokemon go collection because it seems like it should be a relatively common it seems like it should be relatively common but i had neither caught it in the wild nor hatched it from an egg since it's in its initial release on may 17 2019. it turns out that this pokemon is not usually available from eggs and can only be caught when a mossy lure is used on a pokestop this pokemon has two fast attacks bullet seed and tackle and three charged attacks dazzling gleam petal blizzard and seed bomb this pokemon can evolve into one of two final forms randomly determined within pokemon go the final evolution is generally available in the wild in pokemon go but the form you will see depends on weather conditions at the time of capture you cannot alternate the forms within pokemon go there you go not too hard not too easy pokemon go players put your thinking caps on uh i forgot to say at the somewhere earlier in the episode uh there was an issue with apple podcasts last week nothing i can do here we've talked about this before there was an issue on spotify like three months ago this is what i will say though because you if you made it to the end you're obviously a hardcore fan thank you for making it but let me tell you let me tell you the details here i don't expect anyone to understand how podcasts work but it's it's it's really straightforward on my wild west i upload the podcast only once i edit it well i technically upload it three times but that's because we have a premium feed and whatnot anyways i edit the podcast i hit the upload button and once it goes on to the rss feed it goes everywhere we have where our show is available on 200 different podcast apps spotify stitcher apple podcast uh pocketcast overcast you name it podbean we're there think of 185 other podcast apps or there i don't specifically ever and no podcaster does upload specifically to spotify or specifically to stitcher that's just not how podcasting works so when a when it doesn't appear on your favorite service i assure you that i didn't forget to upload it to that service because i just that doesn't happen yeah but this is what i can it this is what i can guarantee if i got hit by a bus on sunday night while in my last dying breath i will text will and i will say make sure that monday's episode gets published and it will it will get public it gets published every monday morning at 6 a.m central time no matter what so if it is 6 10 am and you're like where is my podcast i it is it is undoubtedly your app and not me because when i'm crushed underneath that bus i will make sure i hit that upload button or will hits that upload button um so the the other way you can test that is if you just go to our website pokemonpodcast.com the if the episode is there on the website and it's not in your favorite podcast app like stitcher there's probably an issue with stitcher there's not a lot i can do to specifically fix that but apple podcast has had a lot of issues in the last week specifically because they were supposed to release their premium podcast episodes on june 15th and that never happened like i uploaded the premium podcast for apple podcast and that button doesn't even appear for listeners yet i've done everything they said they were going to do and for some people the episode popped up in apple podcasts some people it didn't i did get a couple tweets being like where's did you forget to upload apple podcast no i didn't apple podcast is just broken this week but like i said i promise you 6 a.m central time every monday the episode will be there and if it's not there it might be your podcast app uh unless suddenly i go missing but i don't even if i go missing we'll will we'll make sure the pocket is correct that's like one of the most important things ever is that consistency of making sure the episode goes up hopefully it's fixed this week um let me know you know i i think if it if it doesn't show up in apple podcast right away i'm sure i will hear on twitter or whatnot but um like i said i promise you every monday 6 a.m central time the episode will go up no matter what um so yeah thank you for listening if you want to follow us on twitter uh greg is at white wing will is that watching the sync i'm at dragging a lake podcast on twitter at pkmncst same thing for instagram tik tok youtube twitch all that stuff uh if you're listening to this on monday the week three of my xdl i'm in a draft league for battle so if you would like to see my progress in the draft league that should be up on youtube by the time you're listening to this it was a fun match i promise um but thank you for making it to the end what is our what is our hidden word this week uh hmm cashew butter cashew butter cashew butter badoof yeah golden your golden beetups your shiny beetles which are a lighter color should be
