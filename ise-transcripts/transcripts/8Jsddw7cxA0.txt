[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400 and third episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ with me well I am now a bike person and I'm going to become one of those kind of bike people because I spent a lot of money on my bike those people where they're like cyclist never follow the laws but they want to know the road I'm just gonna be one of those ones that's like everybody should be riding bicycles it's a wonderful way to live your life and then I will have little stories like today literally my first bike ride that I have taken in 34 years what what could possibly have happened maybe not the worst thing that could happen I lived nope among the worst things that can happen ran over a raccoon nope I was Greg this may be a clue that helps you out I was riding my bike through Fort Snelling State Park silence you don't know that in you cannibal the beautiful Fort Snelling --zz State Park they have a fenced off area that is an off-leash dog park how nice but you know what fenced off dog lease the fence off no leash required dog park means there's a lot of dog owners assume the whole rest of the park is also off your dog so that their dog who they can't control decides to chase the bike rider and bite his feet or try to bite his feet and what was even more entertaining was I was like I'm gonna go faster cuz I'm gonna outrun this talk uh I am run out on that dog I did not want to slow down right because the dog was literally trying to bite me [Laughter] yeah I know Mac you like to do jogs around the island from your patrol I thought they had closed for its selling Park and poor selling down completely this ever do it not yet we're getting there Gregg's Here I am here I have been to Fort Snelling I actually did three years ago they had like solve a mystery at Fort Snelling it was like a bunch of actors and you walked around Fort Snelling and they presented a murder to you and we got to try to solve it none of us were all that interested but it was kind of cool that sounds like fun yeah it was fun but I've never done it again that we've seen not that I've checked I did notice this morning that the Mississippi is a bit swollen and a lot of baths at Fort Snelling are under the water there's this one bench that's like it's litter it office looks like it's in the middle of the river but it's up here we've had a lot of precipitation up here which just means it's gonna get worse as it heads down river but yeah it's it's snowed again for those of you who are like winters over nah the East Coasters who were like oh it's 65 here and I was like it's snowing right now there's nothing it snowed it melted but it's still snowed we got to Pokemon news this week Pokemon still pumping out news well tips and tricks of what to do when you're trapped inside your house they do we still don't have an announcement for the sword and shield anime yet we're into April I guess the assumption was we would get the anime maybe in May well we don't know anything really depends on those voice actors being able to get into those voice acting booths don't it if you if you have not seen there's actually a interview with Vanity Fair with Serenata Jenny who's the voice actor of ash and Delia and a couple other Pokemon English voice Hector she's getting a little boy sector okay before anyone listening to the podcast while they're sitting in their house social distancing goes Veronica Taylor is better you don't start one don't start to Sarah's been doing this like four times longer than Veronica Taylor at this point so get over yourself yeah have you gotten all of these people on the show yet look I've slacking I've met it right we had professor Sycamore well yeah we've already hit the pinnacle that's that's peak I've met Veronica's healer I talked to Veronica Taylor she handed me her business card said she wanted to be on the show I've emailed her multiple times to no response although I haven't emailed her since a global pandemic took over submissions like people are itching for things to do now's the time now's the time line up all the voice actors they probably have a small recording studio at home I don't know what to like say to thee well I do well like what well yeah you do but so you Greg and I met the original Professor Oak again the the original cast while people you know loved them because they were probably like nine years old when they heard the original cast they they have done such a small portion of the anime compared to you know the 23 seasons and I have now existed there's not like much to say besides like all these original cast members were super bitter that they were in a contract with four kids and the Pokemon company decided to go with a different production studio and they couldn't have those voice actors get moved over because of the contract that they were with and so they had to recast everyone and now the recast has lasted longer much longer than the original cast so it's not like they're ever coming back well I got no situation and I always see comments of like oh man I wish they would bring Veronica Beck why they're clearly very happy with Sarah in a hamper for 15 plus years there you go they only had Veronica for like six why in the world would they be like hey Sarah we've loved your work for the past but 15 years but some dude on the internet really loved Veronica so we're gonna put you on the bench for this upcoming movie like that's just that situations is not gonna happen they're like they're yeah they're just very happy with Sarah at this point otherwise they would have recast her but anyways if you there's a a seven minute very recent came out like a month ago seven minute video on YouTube from Vanity Fair they interview Sarah and they she goes through of how the scripts get turned into English yeah she has to slightly modify some of the lines to fit Ash's voice movement so they might have to add in words or take out words just to make sure it lines up they show her producer which you know paints the scene for her of like hey ash should be really exhausted here or Ashley be very excited here and it's really cool it's very cool this very cool video I felt bad that they made her you both voice just for that video though cuz Delia is in that clip - all right let's uh let's dive into the show here we have some Pokemon Go news a little bit of sword and shield news a little bit of TCG news but we're gonna start with the TCG news I did that wrong there's probably a fourth thing that I'm forgetting I'm looking at my tabs but I'm forgetting here but we'll start with this from Pokemon calm spring into the Pokemon TCG online never thought I'd see the day claim a special weekly login bonus and earn double trainer tokens from daily verse rewards all through April now is a great time to battle in the Pokemon Trading Card Game online throughout April 2020 players can earn especially special weekly login bonus including digital booster packs and trainer tokens plus you'll earn double the usual trainer tokens from daily verses rewards they that's pretty much that's pretty much no long that's it obviously if you bought in sword and shield packs you can redeem those packs on the the the TCG online and get more booster packs the new booster the new expansion rebel clash comes out at the end of the month beginning of May but from what I haven't done this yet I actually planned on trying to stream some TCG oh actually next week they're pretty much handing out a booster pack a day just by logging in as from home now it's another game I've got to log into everyday I'm gonna make a list yeah I mean we can go down the compliance of client is still not super great and it's still not on iOS and it's still not on switch and I feel like it's on iPad OS which is iOS technically sir no it's technically iPad OS they split it up I I don't remember reading that on the Internet okay last year where iPad OS is technically different than iOS I don't want to hear anyone I love this is this is me yelling at you guys because you're about to yeah yeah I want to hear anyone here like was too small for iOS if hearthstone can make it work it's too small for iris I think it's mostly the client I think the client is just bad and they need to make a new client it is it is an older looking client I will say that they did refresh the wood in the client it's a fluid nicely so there was so like up until like six months ago the table the table was like this brighter it was more of like a I don't know my woods where's the where's Aaron sprigs it was a wall not a wall it's a walnut now but the old one was more like a like a cheap cedar that they perish maybe a merge no no a pine yeah it was like a Pyatt cheap old Poe no not not sanded you know not not oiled up you know no stains just a very cheap cracked pine wood very bad and then the the board the mat very outdated look it looked like it was right out of 2004 just to not confuse people you mean no stain when you say stains that means somebody spilled something on it no I mean like means it's been yeah no stain it hasn't been colored yeah like a like a wood stain I've stash stuff not wood stains so they did update the wood and they updated the board so that looks a little bit better but the I believe the engine behind it all is still not great what if you want to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game before the pandemic and during the pandemic really the only way to actually get players is is through this because no one in Milwaukee at least played the TCPA no not that I know of at least I should check I should check if there's any Pokemon leagues around me but people can play on skype which is what the Vanguard community has really moved to there's no our sign for Vanguard it definitely not there is one but it's literally only accessible from this dot are you domain Will Anderson computer don't go there no one has made it in what's that board game crafter creator no tabletop simulator that's in there but honestly with the amount of effort that that takes it's far easier to just point a camera at your play mat and just play over video discord or video Skype that's a more TCG news here this is also a Pokemon com pokemon TCG collector's chest which unfortunately was not at Target when I went yesterday but I guess this news broke yesterday so well they said it's coming in spring prepare for a trip to the gala region in the Pokemon Trading Card Game with a collector's chest that contains a variety of cool goodies fans will love this TCG collector chests will include three foil cards highlighting each of the gala region's first partner Pokemon rookie score bunny and Sabo it also comes with five TCG booster packs to add to your collection a mini portfolio that can hold your favorite cards additional items like sticker sheets a Pokemon notepad and a coin featuring the first partner trio to top it all off everything comes packed at a sturdy metal case decorated with the images of the legendary Pokemon a chien and zama Zenta it's one of those lunch boxes they've done one of those before also the boxes we talked about last week they were at Target when I went because I was like you know what I need to stock up on a couple booster packs here those boxes were 50 bucks each for eight boosters and an oversized card and so I was like that's a hard no that right away for you to be at clearance cuz I'm paying $50 for Less boosters and one of those boosters being XY evolutions if they were all sword and shield I would have probably highly considered it because at least with like elite trainer Roxas even though I'm paying a little bit extra for the box and the card sleeves and the dice at least I know everything in there is the newest booster in the newest pack of cards rebel clash coming out soon though who are the rebels in this class I was just gonna ask the same question toxicity did you know and this is something I found out only recently that if you go to the lighthouse in the post game the band is set up there and you can watch them put on a performance and it takes like 18 minutes start you can't stop correct yeah although they do warn you they do warn you do ya what is it's like was it like Rilla boom toxicity who else is over there Gilgamesh what is the your Linoone turns into obstacle obstacle is there a seismitoad I don't think so I don't think so I don't know seismitoad feels like it would play a sick banjo will a boom is on drum it's too toxicity as guitarists yeah yeah and yeah oxygen is the lead singer his lead singer okay okay but they needed a banjo player they could call their own you're in seismitoad when they do their Mumford & Sons covers bring in seismitoad for the old banjo right there has to be more musical Pokemon I mean Chimecho didn't make the cut so no no wind chime there's not like a tambourine what's a wind chime in a rock band name other than the Polyphonic Spree name one herb and that would have a wind chime in it it's on the it's on the tip of my tongue they had one Jethro Tull had every instrument that was ever designed throughout history and an album once harpsichord throw it in sousaphone Scheuer and they only had one song Jethro Tull doesn't need more than one song that one song serves it slaps it does whatever slang for whatever area you're in hyah speaking of credits I got credits in Animal Crossing so I don't know about you guys but I beat the game so Wow reddit how did you get credit it means he got KK slider to come to his town I am here to tell everyone that cake a slider loved my town so much that he said that he will perform every Saturday night in my town so while he might be available for the other days of the week Saturday nights he's coming over to tropic Rama to perform booked inclusively so I don't know what to tell you guys you better hope I free up like a Tuesday lad or something I'm just gonna quit now like a fraud cuz there's no point that the whole reason the playing was KK slider I need to break it to you I'm pretty sure you got KJ's slider the not cover band they rent out that dog suit it's like a buck 50 and that's got built-in filtration and go to any town so there's a record player inside I mean what does it mean me like that's not even hard I can do that you got Robson that's why they throw up the credits like don't pay attention to this fake performer on your stage did they quick animal crossing minute I'm sure I'm sure some people are very well okay for this is that how wasn't other I've played every animal crossing but it's such a blur because like the first two weeks of the game go by so fast cuz it's a bunch of new stuff and then you just get into like repetitive you know daily tasks stuff that you end with do they throw up credits that quickly like just whatever you get cake remember and then the credits get thrown up that credit like hey you beat the game you know I been waiting there some time to see a dog here it is there's also you know weird this probably is in the spoiler but when KK shows up you can start terraforming yeah he gives you he throws you the construction hat from the from the wild audience says go go go to town boy it's so weird that the the first you know artificial I would say maybe what it takes like maybe almost two weeks to get KK it to show up if you're doing if your work if you're working fast maybe a little bit quicker if you're not time traveling you can maybe do it in like 10 days but they they do this thing where they're so set on you getting materials for everything which is like new if you've never played it's like okay well now trees give wood and now rocks give rocks and iron and collect all of this stuff to build DIY and to build your watering can that just magically breaks because when watering cans for another water they just explode in your hands look it is an infinite watering can that has some sort of fertilizer in it the magic can't hold up forever and when the magic is gone it explodes like all magic items do D&D 101 Pole and the ladder are clearly indestructible compared to exploding water can so they they're not magic they those are mundane objects that you pull out of your magic pocket they give you this loop and I think the loop is fine although like it's really weird that video games have made things easier and easier and easy and then they introduce something that is like tedious which I think Pokemon has been really good over the years of doing of like okay well uh fifty-fifty nature kind of tedious what if we just put a person in the Pokemon Center and you talked to them and they guarantee you nature's for the day and then what if they were like what if just every Pokemon you encounter with synchronizer has the right thing not saying Pokemon is perfect they're still tedious things in Pokemon but over the years Pete the PC box they have made many quality of life improvement and then I feel like a lot of video games including breath of the wild and now Animal Crossing they're like you know it'd be nice not having to worry about your water can't explode in your face but you know you have to craft these things and it's like fine okay you know Animal Crossing is overall a pretty tedious game you're doing a lot of tedious things over and over it's literally a game where you're pulling weeds most people don't want to do that in real life nope and so you you get into this loop of doing the rhythm of like I got a cut I got chopped some trees I get I hit some rocks I gotta create items and then Kay Kay puts on a show gives you the credits you beat the game he throws you the helmet and he goes go terraforming and none of that stuff requires any grinding they're just like you want to do unlimited paths you want to use this little slightly different shovel to knock down a mountain unlimited buddy but hey you can only water like 30 flowers before that thing explodes it's a wait do you have the golden water and candy I don't but that also explodes yeah the golden watering can cannot no it does in this game it does that is ridiculous I mean you you water like a hundred flowers instead of thirty but it's still it still breaks it's just like a little jarring that the terraforming and let me tell you after doing five hours of terraforming it's not fun terraforming yet I took down an entire mountain in my town and I'm so I am glad that there's no you know you need eighty wood to terraform a mountain or something you don't need anything you can just take down the mountain but it is is it's it's grindy it's just weird that the first half of that game they're like teaching you how to collect stuff and then the second half of that game they're like yeah these these three new features paths adding water and adding land you don't need anything for just it's just unlimited I don't know if it's weird it's it's pretty smart though because I will say at this point if crafting oh those things I'm real tired of it so I'm not I live I'm so much happier with crafting than anything else in that game that that's what keeps me coming back I love adapting stuff I did to it first I love writing like dresses but the the tools are oh it's the tools that are making me frustrated like especially if I go to a mystery island and is there a way in game to see the durability left on something oh you have to oh you'd have to be the account like every everything that you're building right now that's not golden but above the flimsy is like 30 ish it's the ish part that's not good also I did the tree planting thing in my trees aren't giving me more bells on opposite days I'm still trying to figure that out that's that we can't have this conversation is what I'm saying okay so old Animal Crossing fans let me do some gate keeping here they don't appreciate the changes in this game in an old Animal Crossing you couldn't throw things on the ground and then like go to sleep and save the game because in the morning they would be gone so you can throw whatever you want in the grass on the ground at night and when you wake up it's still there and also an old Animal Crossing you could only hold like 20 items and in this game you can hold like 40 items yep so like not already was not only could you can you throw things on the ground quality of life improvement but you can hold double the things quality of life improvement but then they do this not quality life improvement of your tools breaking and then they do this quality of life improvement of giving you this this wheel to use if you press up on the d-pad you have this uh you know The Last of Us destiny literally every game that has like a ring that you can do but that ring is useless and the reason I say that you know it is not at all use this is why it's useless because you have to hold all your tools in your inventory which was like old animal crossing you can only hold 20 items and you know eight of those items or tools unless you were like I don't need the water and can I'm gonna put it down but in all Animal Crossing your tools didn't break so I have a specific order I want my tools in I want the slingshot and the net next to each other so if I was a toggle left and right in the d-pad I can go like I'm catching bugs tie to the left slingshot get the balloon oh there's a butterfly title to the right go back to the net boom a very very powerful duo you can steal it if you want slingshot slingshot butterfly net boom boom um but the but they also like want like so when you when you put the so the d-pad left + right works for what the order they're in your inventory so I have two in my inventory put the butterfly net next to the slingshot and then I like put the fishing rod on this side and then I put the ladder over here so in my head I can remember where it going now you could say well like just use the radial menu but the radial menu doesn't care about anything so I have to then go in and say like oh well this is some wrong order because it was remembering that I I brought two fishing rods because I know a fishing rod is going to break and I'm gonna do a lot of fishing so I built two fishing rods and then once something does break and you go build it the radioman menu doesn't remember it it doesn't ever like I always just want my slingshot to beat up on the radial menu but if my slingshot breaks and at some point I have I built a fishing rod before a slingshot it defaults the fishing rod into the radial menu before the slingshot because it's like what we got we got to fill the radial menu so what items do you have in your inventory we'll just read the ones you just added and we'll put them there it is infuriating it's bad alright so number one this is a Steve only problem because he making items no no I am NOT because my tools break once a week at most because I am playing this game as much as you our and I don't have that many flowers to order okay and like a normal person when I pop up the radial menu I look at it and I say is over there purpose of the radio menu is so that I don't sit there going deep a little deep blue deep six times to get over to the tool that I want I want to press up hit down yeah oh you met you are a Steve that is a you problem universal problem I don't have this problem if you're giving me a menu let me set what things you can lathe let you set you can manually change the radio menu but as soon as tools Gregg then the radio menus like well I can't remember what was possibly here I don't know a shovels always been it's so infuriating why I mean why aren't you building the to of the minute after it breaks why are you carrying multiple tools because okay string fish I'm gonna go up to I'm gonna climb this mountain the mountain that I just destroyed in Animal Crossing string fish is leaving it left by the time this podcast is up I'm gonna climb this mountain I got 400 fish bait and I got like five fishing rods and I'm gonna sit here at the top of this nutin and I'm gonna fish for the fish did you ever get it I did get it hey that's why that's why you would build five fishing rods because if all you're gonna do is fish the fishing where that's gonna break after 30 fish alright just dump it on the ground next to you no words so this is the from Will Anderson if you felt a dying need that you had to get that spirit string fish before it left at the end of March you're playing Animal Crossing wrong you're a game gobbler and you're trying to finish the game as quickly as possible the string fish comes back in December folks I plan on continuing to play animal crossing in December I want to be here for whatever holiday Christmas event they have so I'll get the string fish then y'all need to chill this is a chill game a hangout relax pick a feel a few fruits sell them to your buddies see maybe there's some cute disturbing security monitor wallpaper the string fish wasted at least three days of my animal crossing experience didn't have to yeah but all right with that that three days distracted me from working on my house now I got time to work on my house look at your real house your Animal Crossing house no I mean debatable all right well Animal Crossing hours over all right let's take a break we got some more Pokemon news we will be right back [Music] a little terrific child metal parks what did i see miss in with my very own eyes besides why [Music] okay now the bad news what I was not prepped for bad news I know I'm not ready to handle this 2020 Pokemon Championship Series cancelled I guess is he's not surprising rising it's sad but it's not yeah speculation is if anything is not canceled as of now it's they're probably waiting for the city to force cancel it so they don't have to pay any money which i think is like what WWE did with WrestleMania they waited in South Florida I was like you know what we're not having we know that you want to continue the show but we're gonna tell you know whereas if they decided to cancel on their own they probably would have had to go through insurance and stuff right oh I'm sure I'm sure insurance is involved Gen Con has not cancelled yet right they have not but I mean it is August and most things are but if they were to catch things out they would be punished whereas if Indiana says we can't have Gen Con and I'm sure Indiana's probably like we need this money they are my guess is they were waiting for the convention center to say we're not having you so then they don't pay the penalty but they're never gonna say that in a press release no so what they did say in their press release is after careful review and pursuant to guidance set by for the local regional and national health authorities as well as the World Health Organization public health England and Center for Disease Control for prevention we have made the difficult decision to cancel the 20/20 North America international championships scheduled for June 26 to 28 in Columbus Ohio I actually didn't know it was on Ohio this year I thought was going to be in Indiana and the 2020 World Championships scheduled for August 14th to 16th in London with the cancellations of these pinnacle events the 2020 play pokemon championship series is suspended and all sanctioned play pokemon events including League club pre-release league Challenge League Cup premiere Challenge midseason showdown hey if you want to get into the TCG think of all these events you could have went to are canceled until further notice no championship will be report will be awarded for the remainder of the season any points you earned this season will roll over it in the 2021 play Pokemon series which for those that don't know the 2021 series normally starts in September start someone after the world championships which is August we will look forward which actually you know in the grand scheme of things you not we're not waiting till January we're only waiting till September we look forward to celebrating the accomplishments for all our competitors at the expanded 2021 World Championships in London so they have reconfirmed that worlds 2021 we'll be in London all invitations to the 2020 World Championships will be honored for 2021 I don't even know how many people hit 400 points we are closely monitoring the health mandates guidelines and recommendations from the appropriate government agencies to determine when the resumption of events and operations will be safe for our communities further details are being actively worked on and we will communicate them as soon as they will be finalized in the meantime we thank our millions of players fans organizers and professors around the world for their continued support and understanding during these unique circumstances the Pokemon international Championships and World Championships are very special occasions for us and we know how much they mean to the global play pokemon community we would like to recognize your hard work and dedication to our competitors professors and event organizers during the twenty20 play season and we hope that the spirit of friendship and community that are hallmarks of our amazing fans and these events continued during this challenging time and that you take care of yourselves at each others we can't wait to celebrate and see you again extension on getting my passport yeah now you anyone you know worried that they might miss a world that the London trip is a little expensive you guys got a whole year to save up yep maybe it's actually possible for the three of us that go to London next year I had to put it into my budget machine yeah that was good I literally was like I had all my stuff ready I could have get a real ID - as already it was like I'm gonna get my haircut I'm gonna look oh good pictures you're gonna do the Will Anderson haircut come on dude now I'm loving it crow now I'm going full drew down as long as it's gonna go I'm not cutting it to our gonna come out of this like that wizard from that book that's real boring what's his name gorlok attitude Dumbledore Dumbledore - bye next D&D character is gorlok for sure I mark this day besides the worlds and besides Nationals the other biggest Pokemon event that takes place is the Olympics no I was gonna say Pokemon go fast I told you guys months ago how's it gonna happen and I construed this whole thing to make sure I am the scooby-doo villain here besides Nationals in worlds the other biggest Pokemon event I would argue is Pikachu outbreak which takes place in August and it's usually a 12 day event and you sign up for one of the days to go and that does line up with the Japanese go fest usually or a has been but we have no clue if that's gonna get cancelled or at least they haven't said Pikachu outbreak was the beginning of August and Worlds was August 14th so I'm going to assume that they're not doing it this year but I don't know I guess we'll keep our eyes out for that that was another that's I got my that's on my list of things that I want to go to one day is a Pikachu outbreak that would be fun well speaking of competitions the sword and shield twenty20 international online competition is still happening the competition period will take place Thursday April 9th - April 12th so if you're

this event your two k eggs should actually only be 1k egg so maybe now is the tire and leigh investing zero eggs a good stuck at zero or stock yeah i've seen people put their phone in a sock and then just spin the sock the hatch a um an old trick what's the speed limit on twenty miles an hour twenty i need to get one of them speed there's also a contraption on on amazon that will hold your pokeball plus or your phone and it will rock it back and forth oh come on really people I feel like look at me that's like time traveling and a man animal crossing at the end of the day does it really matter no I mean play the game how you want to play but like Pokemon go is is an actual visual an actual visual of how much I've walked in life or ridden your bike or like not walked or left your house which is what mine is hey well since you're a bike owner you can now go down the deep deep Kickstarter rabbit hole of I'm like a list thank you our cyclist Thanks I feel like the number one thing that is is non-stop on Kickstarter is board games everyone and their mother kick starting a board game so I have a very fundamental Kickstarter rule that if it is not produced by Greg Leatherman I don't invest yeah and then the number two thing I feel like is bike accessories what kind of bike accessory yeah oh now I'm looking you know I'm looking oh they have they have speedometers and lights and flashy gangs and which are important I mean lights are amazing if somebody else is out there it's like me and hasn't ridden a bike in 34 years the number of things that they can sell you to stick on your bike that's what I'm saying that's why Kings Marberry blowing that's why at one point I was like okay at one point I was addicted to Kickstarter I wasn't actually addicted to the products I was receiving I was just like I want to back this there was exclusive of rewards I could be one of the first and then I fell down the bike rabbit hole on Kickstarter and I was like maybe I should get a bike so this is when I had a real job did you find the rabbit hole Greg oh yes green disc the Eco chain care lubricate your bike chain in seconds and protect the environment elevate the bike rack for 80 living space which sadly I'm really drawn to that because I need a place to put the bike you can get your bike your graphic custom bike graphics displayed for your wall there has to be like 40 different lights right now active areas first Auto unlocking smart bike lock oh yeah lacks locks are really popular bike clip the most versatile bike stand delight the intelligence of the intelligent bike light which I came into that II flector 360 the bike reflector with 360 degrees of visibility the bottle holder the DC try the first truly universal stand up a bike firearm cycle I don't think bike park owned them yes I'd like till your soil for you while you're riding three friends ride their bikes from into Sweden while visiting and working on farms oh yeah we're kick-starting your vacation okay I see how that one goes I lock it GPS Smart Security for your bike pal rechargeable light for indoors and outdoors one year commuted rip ster interior bike storage made simple I'm sorry I'm sorry to all bike owners listening to this podcast that didn't know that Kickstarter has it has an unlimited supply of things to accessorize your bike oh I am I am only halfway through the page oh I'm I'm sure there's probably 20 more popping up by the time this podcast is out too so I will say one thing that my friend Chris told me one of the three Chris's that I it's one of he's very wise for his years I must say that he said that bike box no matter what the bike lock is all they serve is to keep honest people honest and you should never rely on a bike lock to actually keep your bike from getting stolen because if somebody really wants to steal it that bike locks not gonna do it now oh the nether excuse me that's a PG Show and that are the next generation of the bicycle multi-tool April's a Pokemon spotlight ours thank you trainers for your bike knowledge and your feedback from the Pokemon spotlight our and mystery bonus hour we are continuing to test these many events and were happy to report that we are combining them into one weekly event for the month of April we wanted to provide you some of this information of the combined events so you can prepare these I'm actually really excited for this there's a not a lot of Pokemon news that gets me out of my seat but because of the changes they've made to playing at home and because of this the spotlight ours overlapping with that these have been really actually fun to do so for the month of April Pokemon spotlight ours will take place every Tuesday at 6 p.m. but the local time so your time and I've done a couple of these on Twitch and it is actually surprising to how many people have never heard of spotlight hour this is existed for what like three months now two months where they're like every Tuesday something's happening oh let's say three feel like it's better I feel like is started this year yeah the railing Steve complained about this really harshly probably about five weeks ago yeah what the spotlight yes what was i complaining that they was like planning about I don't listen to you okay well I think it was probably along the lines because I think it was in the same episode where Steve did the I won't use the word hypocritical that sounds like that's not like me let's say walked in one direction and then watching another direction at first he said Pokemon go is a game about getting outside and walking around and then later the episode said I don't want to have to go out to have to find where all of the different raids and things are okay it's like not fair to me those were two different complaints yeah when put next to each other boy oh boy I do want to get up and leave my house but when I do get up and leave my house this is the I remember that I remember this complaint because somebody else tweeted me on Twitter about the like oh didn't you say one thing but then said the different thing my complaint was if you're going to make clone Pokemon be a week long event I can't find the clone Pokemon like if you're making this a limited event and I'm actually going out to find the clone Pokemon why am I seeing a lowland marowak non-stop like just take the alone marowak away for a week I never saw a venusaur that entire week and I was in Boston I saw Blastoise and Charizard but I never saw Venus sir but boy boy oh boy I saw nothing but alone marowak so that's my complaint well you're gonna really hate the may event then [Laughter] what's the Meher event not telling what we're talking about April spotlight there you go okay here we go so Tuesday April 7th this week it will be purloined spotlight our you will earn twice the XP for catching pokémon so double xp for catching any pokemon and they seem to be increasing purloined purloined cannot be shiny it's possible that they will turn it shiny or maybe they just want people to have live parts I don't know for the next Tuesday April 14th it will be Magnemite will be in the spotlight hour so you get a bunch of Magnemite those can be shiny you will earn twice the amount of candy for catching pokémon so I guess if you really want to stock up on magnum eye candy Magnezone is pretty good attacker and for gyms in my opinion as a steel type move electric-type move I don't know kind of bulky you need a Magnezone there you go all pokemon will have double the candy and then the 21st it will be wobbuffet in the spotlight you will earn twice the amount of candy for transferring Pokemon try not to transfer any of your Pokemon until that Tuesday and then do a mass transfer then if you're like me always living at the Pokemon go limit if you can hold off that long you get double the candy and then I guess wobbuffet can't be shiny why not can be shiny it's possible that wobbuffet will be shiny since they made sudowoodo shiny for this pest of it and then the final week Tuesday April 28th Pidgey will be in the spotlight and you will earn double the XP or evolving your Pokemon so maybe stock up of that Magnemite and that purloined candy and then evolve on the 28th nothing about the Thursday's though the Thursday's also have events but they didn't say anything about that maybe you're gonna cut those out but are they still doing Wednesday your spotlight rates they were until two weeks ago then they canceled them and okay and your incense will still work you're lucky eggs will still work your Stardust will still work during these spotlight hours lucky eggs at least four well the double xp will not work with the lucky egg because the lucky egg our bonus well it will work with it uh lucky act but the our lucky egg starts on the ninth so you have to use two lucky eggs during that time if you're if you're um trying to maximise XP this is the last bit of news here which is uh maybe exciting I don't know a little bit of kovat stuff here from this is from the antics Niantic labs com so not the Pokemon go blog but from the antic directly embrace a real world gaming from a home dear in the antic community we are reaching out to extend our best wishes for your wellness at this time of the unprejudiced unprecedent challenge of co vyd nineteen pandemic increased physical and mental strain can have a lasting impact on people we're here for you but the world has changed so what can we do we created neat we creating the antic with the mission to help people get outside exercise and explore the world with the ultimate goal of helping people connect with others you to better have Shadow Ball today we support a global community of hundreds of millions of people that look for our games for a regular entertainment and an opportunity to get outside and connect with friends we have always believed that our games can include the element of indoor play that complements the outdoor exercise and explore DNA that we have built now is the time for our part us for two prioritizes work with the key challenges of making playing indoors as exciting and innovated innovative as our outdoor gameplay we are adding this product to our roadmap so we can enable more ways to play inside and around the home in the coming days in weeks when the world needs it the most while it's impossible to predict how the situation will Co vid will evolve globally we're going to make the following changes to our game and light live events exercise so there are four things here exercise you can track your steps endure with adventure sink so activities like cleaning your house or running on treadmill will count towards game achievements you're gonna make improvements to adventure sinks so this works better with indoor movement and activities number 2 social we are enhancing our in-game visual social features to enable players to stay in touch when they can't meet in real life soon you'll be able you will soon be able to team up with friends and take on raid battles together in Pokemon go from the comfort of your home we'll get back to this Explorer we are looking to we are also looking at how to we can in how to how we can help players virtually visit and share memories with their favorite rural places until then until they can visit once again in person and finally live events we are reimagining what it means to participate in in end Niantic live event this summer and we are putting our creative energy towards bringing that excitement directly to your home that means we are looking working on an entirely new way to enjoy pokemon go fest more details coming soon Oh curses foiled yeah as our community knows we've already made a number of changes to abduct the current environment where where group play is no longer possible and outdoor activity may be restricted we have launched a new form of gameplay in Pokemon NGO called go battle league that you can play anywhere in the world and put in your home we have reduced the walking requirements for go battle league from 3 kilometers to zero and introduced deeply discounted incense and pokeballs so people can play people can catch pokemon without having to travel gifts have been far more useful content we've increased the storage so you can send and receive more I'm gonna skip the Harry Potter stuff I'm gonna skip it did they not did we ever talk about the fact that they increase the gym interaction distance they just did that this week so your circle around you is 50% bigger which I still can't reach the gym from my house with that but also I am sure there's I'm sure there are situations where that 50% does help some people so I think that I think that was a good thing overall but I'm not gonna be entitled and say like well they should have increased its a thousand percent cuz then I could reach to the gym from my couch it's fine it literally takes me 60 seconds to leave my front door walk to the gym swipe it and walk back and in all honesty I should probably be doing that because I work at a desk all day so I should be walking down the street spinning the gym and walking back okay so Pokemon go fast they didn't say that it's canceled but it doesn't sound like anyone's traveling to Pokemon go fast my assumption I'm guessing I would love to hear your guys's thoughts is Pokemon go fest will be something like the genesect event or the regigigas event where you will pay probably 10 bucks you will get some sort of benefits this was the main reason I wanted to try the safari zone event at my house because I wanted to see what that was like and obviously Greg and other people I've talked to who left their house that day they were able to encounter more Pokemon and ideally more shiny pokemon if you care about that because they were seeing more Pokemon by leaving their house that being said in my house during the Safari Zone event I did get non-stop ability to catch Pokemon because the incense was popping every 30 seconds so I did have something to do the entire seven hours I played from home but I understand I probably would have saw more Pokemon if I left but because of how they can make an incense work they can definitely make constant Pokemon spawn in your house if they were to do a paid go fest at home and I don't think it's going to be free no there's no way it's gonna be free some go fast happening at home this year I I know I I think that that's like I agree a hundred percent and they're probably going to find some way to do a version of research tasks that does not require spending poke a stops so that you can do a series of - I mean they can do the the professor ones right just kind of over to you from the professor well the sparse old one was good too because you know take a picture of your Pokemon okay now we all of a sudden you have 100 more great balls like they they kind of figured out how to keep you slightly replenished through easy tests that you can do I would assume if it was like a Pokemon go fest they would be more than sick I think there were six tasks for the safari zone two pages I can say Ted three each I need a reason to interact with the game at this point so a go fest would help with that because right now I mean I'm not interacting with my phone a lot as it is because I'm at home and I have my full computer and I have a switch and I have an Xbox and I have all sorts of other things that keep me entertained and quite frankly I just don't since I'm not walking as much and I'm not downtown where I have a bunch of stops I'm just not interacting with the game I'm just not so having like an event to pull me into it that I can do with y'all is something that I'm interested in and I i don't really care a lot what that looks like as long as it's not incumbent of me traveling around the city and then other thing that people got super excited about was the you'll soon be able to team up with friends and take out and raid battles together in Pokemon go from the comfort of your home literally no clue what that's supposed to look like nope yeah is that like who starts the raid like it is it a situation where you have to be friends with somebody on your list and is it a situation where I can't okay this is this is what I imagined I could be wrong please what I imagined I imagined that they're not bringing raids to your house I don't imagine that there's suddenly gonna be a polka stop at everyone's house or a gym at everyone house what I assume is if me will and Greg are friends and Greg is at a target and there is a cabal ian popping at Target Greg logs into the LA because he he is out and about and at the target the target ball or whatever and then we will and I can then get invites to join that but one person still has to go out and do it and actually see that I I don't think that's it yet I'm seeing thinking more of maybe something like a max raid battle and like star pieces wishing pieces where it's like you can get items through some sort of research tasks or something that allow you to launch a raid from your house and then you can invite people if they want to do this again more in if they want to do this in the next coming weeks cuz they also I think somewhere they said I think it was unread if they replied to somebody saying like oh we just started working on this if the raids already exist and they're already active and they're already on timers and somebody does it it seems easier systematically to just be like let me just invite my three star friends just like I would invite my three star friends to a go fest ticket because the app knows your friendship level between people yeah I mean I could also see them running it like go battle League where there's low-level raids for free that you can do maybe once a day and then if you have a premium pass you can get the higher level raids if you pay for it and then you have the ability to like set up a time and say hey let's all be here I'm gonna send you the code or the invite and I've paid for these raids and it's run like go battle League they still want their dollars though yeah but I mean if you're looking at if you're looking at one-star raids in the one and two sir rates in the first path and four and five star trades in the paid path they're still getting paid yeah my people are still gonna pay for the better raid I'm assuming you still have to be friends with the person I don't yeah I'm absolutely assuming they're going to maximize and use the French the friendslist so I don't think like I can I can plug my iPhone into my Elgato and then stream raids and just like max ray battles that we do on Monday nights I don't imagine that I'm going to be like all right Pokemon go raids everyone watching my stream jump on in I would assume that it's probably restricted to the friends list and you probably what was go fast you had to be at least two star friends which is seven gifts yeah it's like one week one week I just don't see a situation where you're just sitting on your couch doing raids non-stop even if you have the money to do it even if it's like well I can do you know six raids an hour and I'm just gonna spend six dollars six dollars six dollars and four hours later I've spent 24 bucks doing raids non-stop there I feel like there still has to be a trigger of like one per maybe they did maybe there doesn't but then at that point when they take this all away when the world is finally finished and hopefully over this thing do people just do they get burnt out do they not care do they go like well I'm never going to leave a raid again or do does the antic remove the feature and people are like okay this is now worst game like I feel like there still has to be one person doing like going out and activating this I just the the situation of just sitting there doing raids non-stop doesn't seem like the it seems like a very lazy like well we can get our money this way and people can do it and I don't know it just seems like a quick thing to implement and then like a harder thing to remove and like try to justify of like okay now you have to leave to do the same thing you were doing from your couch yeah I mean I don't know who we aren't I mean it's pretty easy saying hey one person still has to go out in the public it isn't a great look right now like yeah yeah that's the problem well I mean they make research any they literally just increase the thing to reach gyms easier though like they don't have to go out in public yeah you still don't have to go out in public to activate a raid right like if you were close enough to a gym so let's just pretend the Burger King next to you will was a gym and the egg popped and you could reach it from your luxurious boutique apartment you could then text me and Greg and you could say oh I see a Landorus popping in 45 minutes are you guys free and then we could be like yeah and then you joined the lobby you invite us and that way there is still some artificial time thing instead of you being like all right you want to do Landorus cool ok you want to do another Lander is cool well well let's just keep doing Landers until we get shiny I'd know Landers can't be shiny that example but like that would be the alternate situation of like let's just keep doing them over I don't think that's the alternate situation I don't think that you'd be able to do them back to back to back if if there's no movement involved I think there is definitely a timer set in place but I mean this thing that you're talking about most people aren't by gyms I mean I don't live next door to an entire art installation I do have to travel for that the situation of oh I can reach it even is extended like I live in a populated area and I still have to travel a mile to get to a gym I still have to do that work I still have to go out in a time when shelter and place orders are everywhere so I don't know that they can say hey you have to one person has to take the risk of going out to find a raid like ethically I don't know that that's a decision they can make I mean the other half of this is that I think anything that they roll out to make the game more playable at home without going out they're not going to roll back so that whatever they do for this raid mechanic for people to be able to do it from home that's that's just gonna be in the game for all time it's a it's a it's a quandary I don't know what they're gonna do but I don't think heading out to find an active raise is going to be a big part of it imagine that they'll say hey you can do one free one from your home a day but if you are able to go out or something they might say then you can do it more yeah that makes sense it's a real weird thing it's who we are in a weird time I have no clue when when like how fast can they get something like this ready though like I feel like something something like the body feature or something Google people they're real smart they can do lots of stuff baby they got nothing but time yeah they're all just sitting at home anyways slamming their keyboards waiting just words that happen if it comes sooner than later cool maybe it maybe it's even simpler than we think maybe it's more complicated I don't know but that's on Niantic labs calm they'll be in the show notes if you want to read it there's some stuff about Harry Potter and what they're doing with Harry Potter there's some stuff about ingress what they're doing with ingress I don't think I read this but it says in areas where it's permitted by local authorities outdoor walks practice with proper social distancing will continue to be a great way to contribute towards your physical and mental health you will be able to still play our games while you do that these changes we are making is an alternative one that is not possible bike rides are good too I saw a lot of people riding riding the bike when I was at when I drove through the park the other day a lot of people playing tennis - yeah that's the one that I'm like hmm but I mean yeah you are a distance apart so I guess that's fine everything else is pretty empty except the tennis courts there was maybe there was like a little mini tennis tournament happening I was like mmm tennis interesting we had some youths playing basketball and I glared at them as I was walking my dogs oh I shout out to Stuart who sent in the championship cancelation news in our attact Channel Pokemon of the week okay clues from last week's Pokemon of the week special edition to this edition spelled a not e Steve actually mentioned the Pokemon of the week earlier in this episode so this Pokemon makes either seven tones or cries which results in ultrasonic waves that have the power to knock foes lying is a suction cup on the top of its head cannot learn fly but it only has the ability levitate no other abilities first appeared in Ruby and Sapphire last time it actually appeared in a game Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire interestingly enough does not have a particular type ink that it would have from looking at its physical form its stage 100 in Pokemon shuffle and it used to be able to be picked up with a cleanse tag which is a particularly useless item who is that Pokemon it's chatot oh you're the worst he got it right this time let's just give it to him whatever throw the script out the window it's chata yeah that's right finally I knew it was time ago you did gyro correct Chimecho is that is the answer Chimecho is a combination of chime and eken my national pokedex number and the number of episodes in which it first appeared is the same 358 do you think that's ever on purpose do you think that's just like some like coincidence that is not on purpose they record those things so out of order chime echoes index number is the very last in gen3 include excluding glitch Pokemon like unknown except in Pokemon Gale of Darkness which this trade one of the greatest games ever belongs the munchlax that's like the weirdest trivia I make us based on I wouldn't understand what that means in each Pokemon game of generation three all Pokemon have an unseen index number to identify them in the games ROM the majority of them are in the National pokedex order in fact Pokemon 0 0 1 2 250 1 inclusive are in the same position they are in the National Dex it is important to note that unknown data is stored in the index number is 201 meaning that the index number 413 2 439 unknown be 2 question mark are empty spaces which are occupied only by sprites unknown letters are determined by their personality value and different sprites index number 413 2 439 depending on personality value however in Gallup darkness the unknown letters have been moved to the index number 4 or 15 to 4 or 41 to make room for bond sly and munchlax come on did you know that I guess I kind of understand now somewhat so for whatever reason Chimecho appears after deoxys in the index number is well before that possibly because Chimecho much like masculine was an afterthought oh my gosh and then we need more wind chime exactly another psychic pokémon guys more cowbell all right is there any other Chimecho trivia no no this literally that's it all right James had one I believe that is he had one for a short period of time you are correct all right this week's Pokemon this is gonna be a shorter one either it's gonna be very easy for you or it's gonna be real hard for you that's sometimes that's just the way the chips fall here we go this Pokemon falls squarely into the type least appreciated by Greg even though it is debatable whether it should I don't know what the term is for people who do not like artificial constructed life-forms but I will use the term biologist Greg is a biologist this week's Pokemon has a unique ability not seen in any other Pokemon the ability very simply increases its special attack every time another Pokemon faints very few people know of this ability because in most competitions you cannot use this week's Pokemon while it has existed for almost four years it has not been available in many games I will say the most fun thing I discovered about this week's Pokemon is that when looking at a nanogram descrambler for its name I discovered that the letters in its name can be used to spell anagram if you leave one letter out I wonder if the Pokemon company knew this when it was named that's your pokemon of the week easy-peasy easy-peasy all right we will be back next week of course the Pokemon news doesn't stop neither do we if you didn't get enough animal crossing in this podcast I do another new podcast called animals crossing lines which you can find anywhere you get your podcasts Spotify Google Apple however you're listening to this whatever app you're using I'm sure you can find the other one so you need more animal crossing there you go if if you're listening to this on a Monday morning and you
