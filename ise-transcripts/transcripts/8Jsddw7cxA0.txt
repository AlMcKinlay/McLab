[Music] (0:01 - 0:28)
what's up everyone welcome to the 400 (0:26 - 0:31)
and third episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:28 - 0:34)
it's super effective I'm your host SBJ (0:31 - 0:38)
with me well I am now a bike person and (0:34 - 0:41)
I'm going to become one of those kind of (0:38 - 0:43)
bike people because I spent a lot of (0:41 - 0:47)
money on my bike those people where (0:43 - 0:48)
they're like cyclist never follow the (0:47 - 0:51)
laws but they want to know the road I'm (0:48 - 0:53)
just gonna be one of those ones that's (0:51 - 0:57)
like everybody should be riding bicycles (0:53 - 0:59)
it's a wonderful way to live your life (0:57 - 1:02)
and then I will have little stories like (0:59 - 1:05)
today literally my first bike ride that (1:02 - 1:10)
I have taken in 34 years what what could (1:05 - 1:13)
possibly have happened maybe not the (1:10 - 1:14)
worst thing that could happen I lived (1:13 - 1:17)
nope among the worst things that can (1:14 - 1:20)
happen ran over a raccoon nope (1:17 - 1:22)
I was Greg this may be a clue that helps (1:20 - 1:24)
you out I was riding my bike through (1:22 - 1:27)
Fort Snelling State Park (1:24 - 1:31)
silence you don't know that in you (1:27 - 1:33)
cannibal the beautiful Fort Snelling (1:31 - 1:37)
--zz State Park they have a fenced off (1:33 - 1:41)
area that is an off-leash dog park how (1:37 - 1:45)
nice but you know what fenced off dog (1:41 - 1:48)
lease the fence off no leash required (1:45 - 1:51)
dog park means there's a lot of dog (1:48 - 1:54)
owners assume the whole rest of the park (1:51 - 1:56)
is also off your dog so that their dog (1:54 - 1:59)
who they can't control decides to chase (1:56 - 2:03)
the bike rider and bite his feet or try (1:59 - 2:05)
to bite his feet and what was even more (2:03 - 2:07)
entertaining was I was like I'm gonna go (2:05 - 2:09)
faster cuz I'm gonna outrun this talk uh (2:07 - 2:14)
I am run out on that dog I did not want (2:09 - 2:17)
to slow down right because the dog was (2:14 - 2:19)
literally trying to bite me (2:17 - 2:22)
[Laughter] (2:19 - 2:29)
yeah I know Mac you like to do jogs (2:22 - 2:31)

like solve a mystery at Fort Snelling it (2:47 - 2:52)
was like a bunch of actors and you (2:50 - 2:53)
walked around Fort Snelling and they (2:52 - 2:57)
presented a murder to you and we got to (2:53 - 2:57)
try to solve it (2:57 - 2:59)
none of us were all that interested but (2:57 - 3:02)
it was kind of cool that sounds like fun (2:59 - 3:04)
yeah it was fun but I've never done it (3:02 - 3:05)
again that we've seen not that I've (3:04 - 3:06)
checked (3:05 - 3:07)
I did notice this morning that the (3:06 - 3:10)
Mississippi is a bit swollen and a lot (3:07 - 3:13)
of baths at Fort Snelling are under the (3:10 - 3:16)
water there's this one bench that's like (3:13 - 3:18)
it's litter it office looks like it's in (3:16 - 3:22)
the middle of the river but it's up here (3:18 - 3:22)
we've had a lot of precipitation up here (3:23 - 3:29)
which just means it's gonna get worse as (3:26 - 3:31)
it heads down river but yeah it's it's (3:29 - 3:34)
snowed again for those of you who are (3:31 - 3:37)

we still don't have an announcement for (3:58 - 4:03)
the sword and shield anime yet we're (4:00 - 4:04)
into April (4:03 - 4:07)
I guess the assumption was we would get (4:04 - 4:10)
the anime maybe in May well we don't (4:07 - 4:12)
know anything really depends on those (4:10 - 4:13)
voice actors being able to get into (4:12 - 4:16)
those voice acting booths don't it if (4:13 - 4:18)
you if you have not seen there's (4:16 - 4:21)

this point so get over yourself yeah (4:47 - 4:54)

look I've slacking I've met it right we (4:55 - 5:01)
had professor Sycamore well yeah we've (4:59 - 5:03)
already hit the pinnacle that's that's (5:01 - 5:05)
peak I've met Veronica's healer I talked (5:03 - 5:07)
to Veronica Taylor she handed me her (5:05 - 5:08)
business card said she wanted to be on (5:07 - 5:11)
the show I've emailed her multiple times (5:08 - 5:14)
to no response although I haven't (5:11 - 5:16)
emailed her since a global pandemic took (5:14 - 5:19)
over submissions like people are itching (5:16 - 5:22)
for things to do now's the time now's (5:19 - 5:24)
the time line up all the voice actors (5:22 - 5:26)
they probably have a small recording (5:24 - 5:27)
studio at home I don't know what to like (5:26 - 5:31)
say to thee well I do well like what (5:27 - 5:37)
well yeah you do but so you Greg and I (5:31 - 5:40)
met the original Professor Oak again the (5:37 - 5:44)
the original cast while people you know (5:40 - 5:45)
loved them because they were probably (5:44 - 5:46)
like nine years old when they heard the (5:45 - 5:49)
original cast they they have done such a (5:46 - 5:51)
small portion of the anime compared to (5:49 - 5:54)
you know the 23 seasons and I have now (5:51 - 5:56)
existed there's not like much to say (5:54 - 5:57)
besides like all these original cast (5:56 - 5:59)
members were super bitter that they were (5:57 - 6:02)
in a contract with four kids and the (5:59 - 6:04)
Pokemon company decided to go with a (6:02 - 6:08)
different production studio and they (6:04 - 6:10)
couldn't have those voice actors get (6:08 - 6:12)
moved over because of the contract that (6:10 - 6:15)
they were with and so they had to recast (6:12 - 6:15)
everyone (6:15 - 6:17)
and now the recast has lasted longer (6:15 - 6:20)
much longer than the original cast so (6:17 - 6:23)
it's not like they're ever coming back (6:20 - 6:26)
well I got no situation and I always see (6:23 - 6:27)
comments of like oh man I wish they (6:26 - 6:31)
would bring Veronica Beck why they're (6:27 - 6:34)
clearly very happy with Sarah in a (6:31 - 6:38)
hamper for 15 plus years there you go (6:34 - 6:41)
they only had Veronica for like six why (6:38 - 6:42)
in the world would they be like hey (6:41 - 6:44)
Sarah we've loved your work for the past (6:42 - 6:48)
but 15 years but some dude on the (6:44 - 6:50)
internet really loved Veronica so we're (6:48 - 6:51)
gonna put you on the bench for this (6:50 - 6:53)
upcoming movie like that's just that (6:51 - 6:55)
situations is not gonna happen (6:53 - 6:58)
they're like they're yeah they're just (6:55 - 7:00)
very happy with Sarah at this point (6:58 - 7:03)
otherwise they would have recast her but (7:00 - 7:05)
anyways if you there's a (7:03 - 7:08)
a seven minute very recent came out like (7:05 - 7:10)
a month ago seven minute video on (7:08 - 7:13)
YouTube from Vanity Fair they interview (7:10 - 7:16)
Sarah and they she goes through of how (7:13 - 7:19)
the scripts get turned into English yeah (7:16 - 7:22)
she has to slightly modify some of the (7:19 - 7:26)
lines to fit Ash's voice movement so (7:22 - 7:28)
they might have to add in words or take (7:26 - 7:29)
out words just to make sure it lines up (7:28 - 7:32)
they show her producer which you know (7:29 - 7:34)
paints the scene for her of like hey ash (7:32 - 7:36)
should be really exhausted here or (7:34 - 7:38)
Ashley be very excited here and it's (7:36 - 7:40)
really cool it's very cool this very (7:38 - 7:42)
cool video I felt bad that they made her (7:40 - 7:44)
you both voice just for that video (7:42 - 7:48)

client is still not super great and it's (9:19 - 9:26)
still not on iOS and it's still not on (9:22 - 9:29)
switch and I feel like it's on iPad OS (9:26 - 9:32)
which is iOS technically sir no it's (9:29 - 9:35)
technically iPad OS they split it up I I (9:32 - 9:37)
don't remember reading that on the (9:35 - 9:37)
Internet (9:37 - 9:42)
okay last year where iPad OS is (9:37 - 9:45)
technically different than iOS I don't (9:42 - 9:47)
want to hear anyone I love this is this (9:45 - 9:48)
is me yelling at you guys because you're (9:47 - 9:50)
about to yeah yeah I want to hear anyone (9:48 - 9:52)
here like was too small for iOS if (9:50 - 9:56)
hearthstone can make it work it's too (9:52 - 9:59)
small for iris I think it's mostly the (9:56 - 10:00)
client I think the client is just bad (9:59 - 10:03)
and they need to make a new client it is (10:00 - 10:06)
it is an older looking client I will say (10:03 - 10:09)
that they did refresh the wood in the (10:06 - 10:13)
client it's a fluid nicely so there was (10:09 - 10:17)
so like up until like six months ago the (10:13 - 10:22)
table the table was like this brighter (10:17 - 10:25)
it was more of like a I don't know my (10:22 - 10:27)
woods where's the where's Aaron sprigs (10:25 - 10:29)
it was a wall not a wall it's a walnut (10:27 - 10:32)
now but the old one was more like a like (10:29 - 10:36)
a cheap cedar that they perish maybe a (10:32 - 10:38)
merge no no a pine yeah it was like a (10:36 - 10:41)
Pyatt cheap old Poe no not not sanded (10:38 - 10:44)
you know not not oiled up you know no (10:41 - 10:48)
stains just a very cheap cracked pine (10:44 - 10:52)
wood very bad and then the the board the (10:48 - 10:54)
mat very outdated look it looked like it (10:52 - 10:57)
was right out of 2004 just to not (10:54 - 11:01)
confuse people you mean no stain when (10:57 - 11:03)
you say stains that means somebody (11:01 - 11:05)
spilled something on it no I mean like (11:03 - 11:08)
means it's been yeah no stain it hasn't (11:05 - 11:10)
been colored yeah like a like a wood (11:08 - 11:13)
stain I've stash stuff (11:10 - 11:19)
not wood stains so they did update the (11:13 - 11:22)
wood and they updated the board so that (11:19 - 11:23)
looks a little bit better but the I (11:22 - 11:25)
believe the engine behind it all is (11:23 - 11:27)
still not great what if you want to play (11:25 - 11:30)
the Pokemon Trading Card Game (11:27 - 11:32)
before the pandemic and during the (11:30 - 11:34)
pandemic really the only way to actually (11:32 - 11:37)
get players is is through this because (11:34 - 11:40)
no one in Milwaukee at least played the (11:37 - 11:46)
TCPA no not that I know of at least I (11:40 - 11:47)
should check I should check if there's (11:46 - 11:50)
any Pokemon leagues around me but people (11:47 - 11:52)
can play on skype which is what the (11:50 - 11:54)
Vanguard community has really moved to (11:52 - 11:57)
there's no our sign for Vanguard it (11:54 - 12:00)
definitely not there is one but it's (11:57 - 12:06)
literally only accessible from this dot (12:00 - 12:09)
are you domain Will Anderson computer (12:06 - 12:13)
don't go there no one has made it in (12:09 - 12:16)
what's that board game crafter creator (12:13 - 12:18)
no tabletop simulator that's in there (12:16 - 12:20)
but honestly with the amount of effort (12:18 - 12:22)
that that takes it's far easier to just (12:20 - 12:25)
point a camera at your play mat and just (12:22 - 12:28)
play over video discord or video Skype (12:25 - 12:31)

does whatever slang for whatever area (16:16 - 16:23)
you're in hyah speaking of credits I got (16:19 - 16:25)
credits in Animal Crossing so I don't (16:23 - 16:26)
know about you guys but I beat the game (16:25 - 16:30)
so Wow reddit how did you get credit it (16:26 - 16:32)
means he got KK slider to come to his (16:30 - 16:37)
town I am here to tell everyone that (16:32 - 16:40)
cake a slider loved my town so much that (16:37 - 16:42)
he said that he will perform every (16:40 - 16:45)
Saturday night in my town so while he (16:42 - 16:47)
might be available for the other days of (16:45 - 16:49)
the week Saturday nights he's coming (16:47 - 16:53)
over to tropic Rama to perform booked (16:49 - 16:55)
inclusively so I don't know what to tell (16:53 - 16:58)
you guys you better hope I free up like (16:55 - 16:59)
a Tuesday lad or something I'm just (16:58 - 17:02)
gonna quit now like a fraud cuz there's (16:59 - 17:04)
no point that the whole reason the (17:02 - 17:07)
playing was KK slider I need to break it (17:04 - 17:09)
to you I'm pretty sure you got KJ's (17:07 - 17:14)
slider the not cover band they rent out (17:09 - 17:17)
that dog suit it's like a buck 50 and (17:14 - 17:20)
that's got built-in filtration and go to (17:17 - 17:23)
any town so there's a record player (17:20 - 17:26)
inside I mean what does it mean me like (17:23 - 17:29)
that's not even hard I can do that (17:26 - 17:31)
you got Robson that's why they throw up (17:29 - 17:33)
the credits like don't pay attention to (17:31 - 17:35)
this fake performer on your stage (17:33 - 17:39)
did they quick animal crossing minute (17:35 - 17:40)
I'm sure I'm sure some people are very (17:39 - 17:42)
well okay for this is that how wasn't (17:40 - 17:44)
other I've played every animal crossing (17:42 - 17:47)
but it's such a blur because like the (17:44 - 17:49)
first two weeks of the game go by so (17:47 - 17:51)
fast cuz it's a bunch of new stuff and (17:49 - 17:53)
then you just get into like repetitive (17:51 - 17:55)
you know daily tasks stuff that you end (17:53 - 17:57)
with do they throw up credits that (17:55 - 18:02)
quickly like just whatever you get cake (17:57 - 18:05)
remember and then the credits get thrown (18:02 - 18:07)
up that credit like hey you beat the (18:05 - 18:09)
game you know I been waiting there some (18:07 - 18:13)
time to see a dog here it is there's (18:09 - 18:15)
also you know weird this probably is in (18:13 - 18:17)
the spoiler but when KK shows up you can (18:15 - 18:19)
start terraforming yeah he gives you he (18:17 - 18:21)
throws you the construction hat from the (18:19 - 18:25)
from the wild audience says go go go to (18:21 - 18:27)
town boy it's so weird that the the (18:25 - 18:30)
first you know artificial I would say (18:27 - 18:32)
maybe what it takes like maybe almost (18:30 - 18:34)
two weeks to get KK it to show up if (18:32 - 18:36)
you're doing if your work if you're (18:34 - 18:37)
working fast maybe a little bit quicker (18:36 - 18:39)
if you're not time traveling you can (18:37 - 18:41)
maybe do it in like 10 days but they (18:39 - 18:44)
they do this thing where they're so set (18:41 - 18:46)
on you getting materials for everything (18:44 - 18:48)
which is like new if you've never played (18:46 - 18:50)
it's like okay well now trees give wood (18:48 - 18:53)
and now rocks give rocks and iron and (18:50 - 18:56)
collect all of this stuff to build DIY (18:53 - 18:59)
and to build your watering can that just (18:56 - 19:01)
magically breaks because when watering (18:59 - 19:03)
cans for another water they just explode (19:01 - 19:06)
in your hands look it is an infinite (19:03 - 19:08)
watering can that has some sort of (19:06 - 19:14)
fertilizer in it the magic can't hold up (19:08 - 19:17)
forever and when the magic is gone it (19:14 - 19:22)
explodes like all magic items do D&D 101 (19:17 - 19:23)
Pole and the ladder are clearly (19:22 - 19:27)
indestructible compared to exploding (19:23 - 19:30)
water can so they they're not magic they (19:27 - 19:32)
those are mundane objects that you pull (19:30 - 19:34)
out of your magic pocket they give you (19:32 - 19:36)
this loop and I think the loop is fine (19:34 - 19:39)
although like it's really weird that (19:36 - 19:41)
video games have made things easier and (19:39 - 19:41)
easier and easy (19:41 - 19:43)
and then they introduce something that (19:41 - 19:45)
is like tedious which I think Pokemon (19:43 - 19:47)
has been really good over the years of (19:45 - 19:51)
doing of like okay well uh fifty-fifty (19:47 - 19:53)
nature kind of tedious what if we just (19:51 - 19:55)
put a person in the Pokemon Center and (19:53 - 19:56)
you talked to them and they guarantee (19:55 - 19:58)
you nature's for the day and then what (19:56 - 20:00)
if they were like what if just every (19:58 - 20:01)
Pokemon you encounter with synchronizer (20:00 - 20:03)
has the right thing not saying Pokemon (20:01 - 20:05)
is perfect they're still tedious things (20:03 - 20:08)
in Pokemon but over the years Pete the (20:05 - 20:11)
PC box they have made many quality of (20:08 - 20:12)
life improvement and then I feel like a (20:11 - 20:14)
lot of video games including breath of (20:12 - 20:17)
the wild and now Animal Crossing they're (20:14 - 20:19)
like you know it'd be nice not having to (20:17 - 20:21)
worry about your water can't explode in (20:19 - 20:24)
your face but you know you have to craft (20:21 - 20:26)
these things and it's like fine okay you (20:24 - 20:28)
know Animal Crossing is overall a pretty (20:26 - 20:29)
tedious game you're doing a lot of (20:28 - 20:31)
tedious things over and over it's (20:29 - 20:32)
literally a game where you're pulling (20:31 - 20:34)
weeds most people don't want to do that (20:32 - 20:35)
in real life nope (20:34 - 20:38)
and so you you get into this loop of (20:35 - 20:41)
doing the rhythm of like I got a cut I (20:38 - 20:43)
got chopped some trees I get I hit some (20:41 - 20:45)
rocks I gotta create items and then Kay (20:43 - 20:47)
Kay puts on a show gives you the credits (20:45 - 20:49)
you beat the game he throws you the (20:47 - 20:51)
helmet and he goes go terraforming and (20:49 - 20:54)
none of that stuff requires any grinding (20:51 - 20:56)
they're just like you want to do (20:54 - 20:58)
unlimited paths you want to use this (20:56 - 21:00)
little slightly different shovel to (20:58 - 21:03)
knock down a mountain unlimited buddy (21:00 - 21:06)
but hey you can only water like 30 (21:03 - 21:09)
flowers before that thing explodes it's (21:06 - 21:12)
a wait do you have the golden water and (21:09 - 21:13)
candy I don't but that also explodes (21:12 - 21:17)
yeah the golden watering can cannot no (21:13 - 21:19)
it does in this game it does that is (21:17 - 21:22)
ridiculous I mean you you water like a (21:19 - 21:23)
hundred flowers instead of thirty but (21:22 - 21:26)
it's still it still breaks it's just (21:23 - 21:29)
like a little jarring that the (21:26 - 21:31)
terraforming and let me tell you after (21:29 - 21:32)
doing five hours of terraforming it's (21:31 - 21:40)
not fun terraforming yet I took down an (21:32 - 21:42)
entire mountain in my town and I'm so I (21:40 - 21:46)
am glad that there's no you know you (21:42 - 21:48)
need eighty wood to terraform a mountain (21:46 - 21:49)
or something you don't need anything you (21:48 - 21:52)
can just take down the mountain but it (21:49 - 21:55)
is is it's it's grindy (21:52 - 21:57)
it's just weird that the first half of (21:55 - 21:59)
that game they're like teaching you how (21:57 - 22:02)
to collect stuff and then the second (21:59 - 22:03)
half of that game they're like yeah (22:02 - 22:06)
these these three new features paths (22:03 - 22:09)
adding water and adding land you don't (22:06 - 22:10)
need anything for just it's just (22:09 - 22:13)
unlimited I don't know if it's weird (22:10 - 22:16)
it's it's pretty smart though because I (22:13 - 22:18)
will say at this point if crafting oh (22:16 - 22:21)
those things I'm real tired of it so I'm (22:18 - 22:24)
not I live I'm so much happier with (22:21 - 22:26)
crafting than anything else in that game (22:24 - 22:29)
that that's what keeps me coming back I (22:26 - 22:33)
love adapting stuff I did to it first (22:29 - 22:36)
I love writing like dresses but the the (22:33 - 22:38)
tools are oh it's the tools that are (22:36 - 22:40)
making me frustrated like especially if (22:38 - 22:43)
I go to a mystery island and is there a (22:40 - 22:46)
way in game to see the durability left (22:43 - 22:48)
on something oh you have to oh you'd (22:46 - 22:50)
have to be the account like every (22:48 - 22:51)
everything that you're building right (22:50 - 22:54)
now that's not golden but above the (22:51 - 22:58)
flimsy is like 30 ish it's the ish part (22:54 - 22:59)
that's not good (22:58 - 23:01)
also I did the tree planting thing in my (22:59 - 23:03)
trees aren't giving me more bells on (23:01 - 23:05)
opposite days I'm still trying to figure (23:03 - 23:06)
that out that's that we can't have this (23:05 - 23:12)
conversation is what I'm saying (23:06 - 23:15)
okay so old Animal Crossing fans let me (23:12 - 23:17)
do some gate keeping here they don't (23:15 - 23:20)
appreciate the changes in this game in (23:17 - 23:23)
an old Animal Crossing you couldn't (23:20 - 23:26)
throw things on the ground and then like (23:23 - 23:28)
go to sleep and save the game because in (23:26 - 23:30)
the morning they would be gone so you (23:28 - 23:31)
can throw whatever you want in the grass (23:30 - 23:32)
on the ground at night and when you wake (23:31 - 23:35)
up it's still there and also an old (23:32 - 23:36)
Animal Crossing you could only hold like (23:35 - 23:39)
20 items and in this game you can hold (23:36 - 23:43)
like 40 items yep so like not already (23:39 - 23:45)
was not only could you can you throw (23:43 - 23:46)
things on the ground quality of life (23:45 - 23:50)
improvement but you can hold double the (23:46 - 23:52)
things quality of life improvement but (23:50 - 23:53)
then they do this not quality life (23:52 - 23:56)
improvement of your tools breaking and (23:53 - 23:58)
then they do this quality of life (23:56 - 24:00)
improvement of giving you this this (23:58 - 24:04)
wheel to use if you press up on the (24:00 - 24:06)
d-pad you have this uh you know The Last (24:04 - 24:09)
of Us destiny literally every (24:06 - 24:11)
game that has like a ring that you can (24:09 - 24:15)
do but that ring is useless and the (24:11 - 24:17)
reason I say that you know it is not at (24:15 - 24:19)
all use this is why it's useless because (24:17 - 24:24)
you have to hold all your tools in your (24:19 - 24:27)
inventory which was like old animal (24:24 - 24:29)
crossing you can only hold 20 items and (24:27 - 24:31)
you know eight of those items or tools (24:29 - 24:33)
unless you were like I don't need the (24:31 - 24:35)
water and can I'm gonna put it down but (24:33 - 24:37)
in all Animal Crossing your tools didn't (24:35 - 24:39)
break so I have a specific order I want (24:37 - 24:44)
my tools in I want the slingshot and the (24:39 - 24:46)
net next to each other so if I was a (24:44 - 24:48)
toggle left and right in the d-pad I can (24:46 - 24:50)
go like I'm catching bugs tie to the (24:48 - 24:50)
left (24:50 - 24:52)
slingshot get the balloon oh there's a (24:50 - 24:53)
butterfly title to the right go back to (24:52 - 24:56)
the net boom a very very powerful duo (24:53 - 24:58)
you can steal it if you want slingshot (24:56 - 25:02)
slingshot butterfly net boom boom um but (24:58 - 25:05)
the but they also like want like so when (25:02 - 25:08)
you when you put the so the d-pad left + (25:05 - 25:11)
right works for what the order they're (25:08 - 25:13)
in your inventory so I have two in my (25:11 - 25:17)
inventory put the butterfly net next to (25:13 - 25:19)
the slingshot and then I like put the (25:17 - 25:21)
fishing rod on this side and then I put (25:19 - 25:23)
the ladder over here so in my head I can (25:21 - 25:25)
remember where it going now you could (25:23 - 25:27)
say well like just use the radial menu (25:25 - 25:31)
but the radial menu doesn't care about (25:27 - 25:34)
anything so I have to then go in and say (25:31 - 25:36)
like oh well this is some wrong order (25:34 - 25:37)
because it was remembering that I I (25:36 - 25:40)
brought two fishing rods because I know (25:37 - 25:41)
a fishing rod is going to break and I'm (25:40 - 25:43)
gonna do a lot of fishing so I built two (25:41 - 25:45)
fishing rods and then once something (25:43 - 25:48)
does break and you go build it the (25:45 - 25:50)
radioman menu doesn't remember it (25:48 - 25:52)
it doesn't ever like I always just want (25:50 - 25:54)
my slingshot to beat up on the radial (25:52 - 25:57)
menu but if my slingshot breaks and at (25:54 - 26:01)
some point I have I built a fishing rod (25:57 - 26:02)
before a slingshot it defaults the (26:01 - 26:04)
fishing rod into the radial menu before (26:02 - 26:06)
the slingshot because it's like what we (26:04 - 26:07)
got we got to fill the radial menu so (26:06 - 26:09)
what items do you have in your inventory (26:07 - 26:10)
we'll just read the ones you just added (26:09 - 26:12)
and we'll put them there it is (26:10 - 26:17)
infuriating it's bad alright so number (26:12 - 26:20)
one this is a Steve only problem because (26:17 - 26:22)
he making (26:20 - 26:25)
items no no I am NOT because my tools (26:22 - 26:28)
break once a week at most because I am (26:25 - 26:30)
playing this game as much as you our and (26:28 - 26:31)
I don't have that many flowers to order (26:30 - 26:35)
okay and like a normal person when I pop (26:31 - 26:38)
up the radial menu I look at it and I (26:35 - 26:47)
say is over there purpose of the radio (26:38 - 26:49)
menu is so that I don't sit there going (26:47 - 26:54)
deep a little deep blue deep six times (26:49 - 26:57)
to get over to the tool that I want I (26:54 - 27:01)
want to press up hit down yeah oh you (26:57 - 27:05)
met you are a Steve that is a you (27:01 - 27:09)
problem universal problem I don't have (27:05 - 27:11)
this problem if you're giving me a menu (27:09 - 27:15)
let me set what things you can lathe let (27:11 - 27:17)
you set you can manually change the (27:15 - 27:19)
radio menu but as soon as tools Gregg (27:17 - 27:22)
then the radio menus like well I can't (27:19 - 27:24)
remember what was possibly here I don't (27:22 - 27:27)
know a shovels always been it's so (27:24 - 27:30)
infuriating why (27:27 - 27:32)
I mean why aren't you building the to of (27:30 - 27:33)
the minute after it breaks why are you (27:32 - 27:36)
carrying multiple tools because okay (27:33 - 27:39)
string fish I'm gonna go up to I'm gonna (27:36 - 27:41)
climb this mountain the mountain that I (27:39 - 27:43)
just destroyed in Animal Crossing string (27:41 - 27:45)
fish is leaving it left by the time this (27:43 - 27:46)
podcast is up I'm gonna climb this (27:45 - 27:52)
mountain I got 400 fish bait and I got (27:46 - 27:55)
like five fishing rods and I'm gonna sit (27:52 - 27:57)
here at the top of this nutin and I'm (27:55 - 28:01)
gonna fish for the fish did you ever get (27:57 - 28:03)
it I did get it hey that's why that's (28:01 - 28:05)
why you would build five fishing rods (28:03 - 28:07)
because if all you're gonna do is fish (28:05 - 28:08)
the fishing where that's gonna break (28:07 - 28:11)
after 30 fish alright just dump it on (28:08 - 28:14)
the ground next to you no words so this (28:11 - 28:18)
is the from Will Anderson if you felt a (28:14 - 28:21)
dying need that you had to get that (28:18 - 28:24)
spirit string fish before it left at the (28:21 - 28:26)
end of March you're playing Animal (28:24 - 28:28)
Crossing wrong (28:26 - 28:30)
you're a game gobbler and you're trying (28:28 - 28:32)
to finish the game as quickly as (28:30 - 28:33)
possible the string fish comes back in (28:32 - 28:36)
December folks I plan on continuing to (28:33 - 28:38)
play animal crossing in December I want (28:36 - 28:40)
to be here for whatever holiday (28:38 - 28:43)
Christmas event they have so I'll get (28:40 - 28:44)
the string fish then y'all need to chill (28:43 - 28:48)
this is a chill game a hangout relax (28:44 - 28:51)
pick a feel a few fruits sell them to (28:48 - 28:53)
your buddies see maybe there's some cute (28:51 - 28:57)
disturbing security monitor wallpaper (28:53 - 28:57)
the string fish wasted at least three (28:58 - 29:03)
days of my animal crossing experience (29:01 - 29:05)
didn't have to yeah but all right with (29:03 - 29:07)
that that three days distracted me from (29:05 - 29:09)
working on my house now I got time to (29:07 - 29:11)
work on my house look at your real house (29:09 - 29:14)
your Animal Crossing house no I mean (29:11 - 29:14)
debatable (29:14 - 29:17)
all right well Animal Crossing hours (29:14 - 29:19)
over all right let's take a break we got (29:17 - 29:22)
some more Pokemon news we will be right (29:19 - 29:24)
back (29:22 - 29:24)
[Music] (29:25 - 29:36)
a little terrific child (29:47 - 29:54)
metal parks (29:51 - 29:54)
what did i see miss in with my very own (29:58 - 30:09)
eyes besides why (30:02 - 30:09)
[Music] (30:09 - 30:21)
okay now the bad news (30:25 - 30:29)
what I was not prepped for bad news I (30:27 - 30:33)
know I'm not ready to handle this 2020 (30:29 - 30:36)
Pokemon Championship Series cancelled I (30:33 - 30:39)
guess is he's not surprising (30:36 - 30:43)
rising it's sad but it's not yeah (30:39 - 30:46)
speculation is if anything is not (30:43 - 30:48)
canceled as of now it's they're probably (30:46 - 30:50)
waiting for the city to force cancel it (30:48 - 30:53)
so they don't have to pay any money (30:50 - 30:56)
which i think is like what WWE did with (30:53 - 30:57)
WrestleMania they waited in South (30:56 - 30:59)
Florida I was like you know what we're (30:57 - 31:02)
not having we know that you want to (30:59 - 31:05)
continue the show but we're gonna tell (31:02 - 31:07)
you know whereas if they decided to (31:05 - 31:08)
cancel on their own they probably would (31:07 - 31:10)
have had to go through insurance and (31:08 - 31:12)
stuff right oh I'm sure I'm sure (31:10 - 31:16)
insurance is involved (31:12 - 31:16)
Gen Con has not cancelled yet right they (31:16 - 31:22)
have not but I mean it is August and (31:19 - 31:25)
most things are but if they were to (31:22 - 31:28)
catch things out they would be punished (31:25 - 31:30)
whereas if Indiana says we can't have (31:28 - 31:32)
Gen Con and I'm sure Indiana's probably (31:30 - 31:35)
like we need this money (31:32 - 31:38)
they are my guess is they were waiting (31:35 - 31:44)
for the convention center to say we're (31:38 - 31:46)
not having you so then they don't pay (31:44 - 31:49)
the penalty but they're never gonna say (31:46 - 31:53)
that in a press release no so what they (31:49 - 31:55)
did say in their press release is after (31:53 - 31:58)
careful review and pursuant to guidance (31:55 - 32:00)
set by for the local regional and (31:58 - 32:02)
national health authorities as well as (32:00 - 32:05)
the World Health Organization public (32:02 - 32:07)
health England and Center for Disease (32:05 - 32:09)
Control for prevention we have made the (32:07 - 32:12)
difficult decision to cancel the 20/20 (32:09 - 32:13)
North America international (32:12 - 32:16)
championships scheduled for June 26 to (32:13 - 32:18)

little expensive you guys got a whole (34:47 - 34:52)
year to save up yep maybe it's actually (34:49 - 34:53)
possible for the three of us that go to (34:52 - 34:56)
London next year I had to put it into my (34:53 - 34:59)

gorlok attitude Dumbledore Dumbledore - (35:28 - 35:42)
bye next D&D character is gorlok for (35:37 - 35:47)
sure I mark this day besides the worlds (35:42 - 35:49)
and besides Nationals the other biggest (35:47 - 35:52)
Pokemon event that takes place is the (35:49 - 35:59)
Olympics no I was gonna say Pokemon go (35:52 - 36:02)
fast I told you guys months ago how's it (35:59 - 36:04)
gonna happen and I construed this whole (36:02 - 36:10)
thing to make sure I am the scooby-doo (36:04 - 36:22)
villain here besides Nationals in worlds (36:10 - 36:24)
the other biggest Pokemon event I would (36:22 - 36:28)
argue is Pikachu outbreak which takes (36:24 - 36:31)
place in August and it's usually a 12 (36:28 - 36:35)
day event and you sign up for one of the (36:31 - 36:39)
days to go and that does line up with (36:35 - 36:43)
the Japanese go fest usually or a has (36:39 - 36:47)
been but we have no clue if that's gonna (36:43 - 36:49)
get cancelled or at least they haven't (36:47 - 36:53)
said Pikachu outbreak was the beginning (36:49 - 36:57)
of August and Worlds was August 14th so (36:53 - 36:59)
I'm going to assume that they're not (36:57 - 37:01)
doing it this year but I don't know I (36:59 - 37:03)
guess we'll keep our eyes out for that (37:01 - 37:05)
that was another that's I got my that's (37:03 - 37:07)
on my list of things that I want to go (37:05 - 37:09)
to one day is a Pikachu outbreak that (37:07 - 37:12)
would be fun well speaking of (37:09 - 37:14)

very fundamental Kickstarter rule that (44:01 - 44:07)
if it is not produced by Greg Leatherman (44:03 - 44:10)
I don't invest yeah and then the number (44:07 - 44:12)

the time this podcast is out too so I (46:43 - 46:47)
will say one thing that my friend Chris (46:45 - 46:50)
told me one of the three Chris's that I (46:47 - 46:53)
it's one of he's very wise for his years (46:50 - 46:57)
I must say that he said that bike box no (46:53 - 46:59)
matter what the bike lock is all they (46:57 - 47:01)
serve is to keep honest people honest (46:59 - 47:03)
and you should never rely on a bike lock (47:01 - 47:05)
to actually keep your bike from getting (47:03 - 47:06)
stolen because if somebody really wants (47:05 - 47:09)
to steal it that bike locks not gonna do (47:06 - 47:13)

you some of this information of the (47:38 - 47:42)
combined events so you can prepare these (47:39 - 47:44)
I'm actually really excited for this (47:42 - 47:47)
there's a not a lot of Pokemon news that (47:44 - 47:51)
gets me out of my seat but because of (47:47 - 47:53)
the changes they've made to playing at (47:51 - 47:55)
home and because of this the spotlight (47:53 - 47:58)
ours overlapping with that these have (47:55 - 48:00)
been really actually fun to do so for (47:58 - 48:02)
the month of April Pokemon spotlight (48:00 - 48:04)
ours will take place every Tuesday at 6 (48:02 - 48:07)
p.m. but the local time so your time and (48:04 - 48:09)
I've done a couple of these on Twitch (48:07 - 48:11)
and it is actually surprising to how (48:09 - 48:12)
many people have never heard of (48:11 - 48:14)
spotlight hour this is existed for what (48:12 - 48:15)
like three months now (48:14 - 48:17)
two months where they're like every (48:15 - 48:20)
Tuesday something's happening oh let's (48:17 - 48:22)
say three feel like it's better I feel (48:20 - 48:25)
like is started this year yeah (48:22 - 48:27)
the railing Steve complained about this (48:25 - 48:30)
really harshly probably about five weeks (48:27 - 48:36)
ago yeah what the spotlight yes what was (48:30 - 48:38)
i complaining that they was like (48:36 - 48:41)
planning about I don't listen to you (48:38 - 48:44)
okay well I think it was probably along (48:41 - 48:45)
the lines because I think it was in the (48:44 - 48:49)
same episode where Steve did the I won't (48:45 - 48:51)
use the word hypocritical that sounds (48:49 - 48:54)
like that's not like me let's say walked (48:51 - 48:56)
in one direction and then watching (48:54 - 48:57)
another direction at first he said (48:56 - 48:59)
Pokemon go is a game about getting (48:57 - 49:01)
outside and walking around and then (48:59 - 49:04)
later the episode said I don't want to (49:01 - 49:06)
have to go out to have to find where all (49:04 - 49:08)
of the different raids and things are (49:06 - 49:10)
okay it's like not fair to me those were (49:08 - 49:15)
two different complaints yeah when put (49:10 - 49:19)
next to each other boy oh boy I do want (49:15 - 49:21)
to get up and leave my house but when I (49:19 - 49:23)
do get up and leave my house this is the (49:21 - 49:24)
I remember that I remember this (49:23 - 49:27)
complaint because somebody else tweeted (49:24 - 49:28)
me on Twitter about the like oh didn't (49:27 - 49:30)
you say one thing but then said the (49:28 - 49:31)
different thing (49:30 - 49:34)
my complaint was if you're going to make (49:31 - 49:37)
clone Pokemon be a week long event I (49:34 - 49:42)
can't find the clone Pokemon like if (49:37 - 49:44)
you're making this a limited event and (49:42 - 49:46)
I'm actually going out to find the clone (49:44 - 49:49)
Pokemon why am I seeing a lowland (49:46 - 49:51)
marowak non-stop like just take the (49:49 - 49:54)
alone marowak away for a week I never (49:51 - 49:57)
saw a venusaur that entire week and I (49:54 - 49:59)
was in Boston I saw Blastoise and (49:57 - 50:01)
Charizard but I never saw Venus sir but (49:59 - 50:03)
boy boy oh boy I saw nothing but alone (50:01 - 50:05)
marowak so that's my complaint well (50:03 - 50:07)
you're gonna really hate the may event (50:05 - 50:07)
then (50:07 - 50:09)
[Laughter] (50:07 - 50:15)
what's the Meher event not telling what (50:09 - 50:17)
we're talking about April spotlight (50:15 - 50:18)
there you go (50:17 - 50:22)
okay here we go so Tuesday April 7th (50:18 - 50:25)
this week it will be purloined spotlight (50:22 - 50:28)
our you will earn twice the XP for (50:25 - 50:31)
catching pokémon so double xp for (50:28 - 50:33)
catching any pokemon and they seem to be (50:31 - 50:35)
increasing purloined purloined cannot be (50:33 - 50:38)
shiny it's possible that they will turn (50:35 - 50:41)
it shiny or maybe they just want people (50:38 - 50:43)
to have live parts I don't know for the (50:41 - 50:45)
next Tuesday April 14th it will be (50:43 - 50:47)
Magnemite will be in the spotlight hour (50:45 - 50:49)
so you get a bunch of Magnemite those (50:47 - 50:51)
can be shiny you will earn twice the (50:49 - 50:53)
amount of candy for catching pokémon so (50:51 - 50:55)
I guess if you really want to stock up (50:53 - 50:57)
on magnum eye candy Magnezone is pretty (50:55 - 50:59)
good attacker and for gyms (50:57 - 51:02)
in my opinion as a steel type move (50:59 - 51:05)
electric-type move I don't know kind of (51:02 - 51:08)
bulky you need a Magnezone there you go (51:05 - 51:11)
all pokemon will have double the candy (51:08 - 51:14)
and then the 21st it will be wobbuffet (51:11 - 51:17)
in the spotlight you will earn twice the (51:14 - 51:19)
amount of candy for transferring Pokemon (51:17 - 51:22)
try not to transfer any of your Pokemon (51:19 - 51:24)
until that Tuesday and then do a mass (51:22 - 51:27)
transfer then if you're like me always (51:24 - 51:31)
living at the Pokemon go limit if you (51:27 - 51:33)
can hold off that long you get double (51:31 - 51:36)
the candy and then I guess wobbuffet (51:33 - 51:39)
can't be shiny why not can be shiny it's (51:36 - 51:40)
possible that wobbuffet will be shiny (51:39 - 51:42)
since they made sudowoodo shiny for this (51:40 - 51:45)
pest of it and then the final week (51:42 - 51:48)
Tuesday April 28th Pidgey will be in the (51:45 - 51:50)
spotlight and you will earn double the (51:48 - 51:53)
XP or evolving your Pokemon so maybe (51:50 - 51:55)
stock up of that Magnemite and that (51:53 - 51:59)
purloined candy and then evolve (51:55 - 52:02)
on the 28th nothing about the Thursday's (51:59 - 52:03)
though the Thursday's also have events (52:02 - 52:05)
but they didn't say anything about that (52:03 - 52:09)
maybe you're gonna cut those out but are (52:05 - 52:10)
they still doing Wednesday your (52:09 - 52:13)
spotlight rates they were until two (52:10 - 52:15)
weeks ago then they canceled them and (52:13 - 52:18)
okay and your incense will still work (52:15 - 52:20)
you're lucky eggs will still work your (52:18 - 52:21)
Stardust will still work during these (52:20 - 52:25)
spotlight hours lucky eggs at least four (52:21 - 52:29)
well the double xp will not work with (52:25 - 52:30)
the lucky egg because the lucky egg our (52:29 - 52:32)
bonus well it will work with it uh lucky (52:30 - 52:34)
act but the our lucky egg starts on the (52:32 - 52:37)
ninth so you have to use two lucky eggs (52:34 - 52:40)
during that time if you're if you're um (52:37 - 52:43)
trying to maximise XP this is the last (52:40 - 52:46)
bit of news here which is uh maybe (52:43 - 52:48)
exciting I don't know a little bit of (52:46 - 52:50)
kovat stuff here from this is from the (52:48 - 52:53)

outdoor exercise and explore DNA that we (53:39 - 53:44)

outdoor gameplay we are adding this (53:52 - 53:56)

more ways to play inside and around the (53:56 - 54:02)
home in the coming days in weeks when (53:59 - 54:03)
the world needs it the most (54:02 - 54:05)
while it's impossible to predict how the (54:03 - 54:06)
situation will Co vid will evolve (54:05 - 54:08)
globally we're going to make the (54:06 - 54:10)
following changes to our game and light (54:08 - 54:13)
live events exercise (54:10 - 54:15)
so there are four things here exercise (54:13 - 54:17)

adventure sink so activities like (54:17 - 54:20)

works better with indoor movement and (54:25 - 54:29)

enhancing our in-game visual social (54:29 - 54:33)

are also looking at how to we can in how (54:48 - 54:53)
to how we can help players virtually (54:51 - 54:55)
visit and share memories with their (54:53 - 54:58)
favorite rural places until then until (54:55 - 55:00)
they can visit once again in person and (54:58 - 55:03)
finally live events we are reimagining (55:00 - 55:06)
what it means to participate in in end (55:03 - 55:08)
Niantic live event this summer and we (55:06 - 55:11)
are putting our creative energy towards (55:08 - 55:12)
bringing that excitement directly to (55:11 - 55:14)
your home that means we are looking (55:12 - 55:16)
working on an entirely new way to enjoy (55:14 - 55:18)
pokemon go fest (55:16 - 55:21)
more details coming soon Oh curses (55:18 - 55:24)
foiled yeah as our community knows we've (55:21 - 55:26)
already made a number of changes to (55:24 - 55:27)
abduct the current environment where (55:26 - 55:29)
where group play is no longer possible (55:27 - 55:31)
and outdoor activity may be restricted (55:29 - 55:34)
we have launched a new form of gameplay (55:31 - 55:36)
in Pokemon NGO called go battle league (55:34 - 55:38)
that you can play anywhere in the world (55:36 - 55:41)
and put in your home we have reduced the (55:38 - 55:42)
walking requirements for go battle (55:41 - 55:45)
league from 3 kilometers to zero and (55:42 - 55:47)
introduced deeply discounted incense and (55:45 - 55:50)
pokeballs so people can play people can (55:47 - 55:52)
catch pokemon without having to travel (55:50 - 55:55)
gifts have been far more useful content (55:52 - 55:56)
we've increased the storage so you can (55:55 - 55:58)
send and receive more I'm gonna skip the (55:56 - 56:00)
Harry Potter stuff I'm gonna skip it did (55:58 - 56:03)
they not did we ever talk about the fact (56:00 - 56:05)
that they increase the gym interaction (56:03 - 56:08)
distance they just did that this week so (56:05 - 56:11)
your circle around you is 50% bigger (56:08 - 56:13)
which (56:11 - 56:15)
I still can't reach the gym from my (56:13 - 56:18)
house with that but also I am sure (56:15 - 56:20)
there's I'm sure there are situations (56:18 - 56:24)
where that 50% does help some people so (56:20 - 56:26)
I think that I think that was a good (56:24 - 56:28)
thing overall but I'm not gonna be (56:26 - 56:29)
entitled and say like well they should (56:28 - 56:31)
have increased its a thousand percent (56:29 - 56:33)
cuz then I could reach to the gym from (56:31 - 56:34)
my couch it's fine (56:33 - 56:37)
it literally takes me 60 seconds to (56:34 - 56:38)
leave my front door walk to the gym (56:37 - 56:40)
swipe it and walk back and in all (56:38 - 56:42)
honesty I should probably be doing that (56:40 - 56:46)
because I work at a desk all day so I (56:42 - 56:47)
should be walking down the street (56:46 - 56:50)
spinning the gym and walking back okay (56:47 - 56:52)
so Pokemon go fast (56:50 - 56:54)
they didn't say that it's canceled but (56:52 - 56:56)
it doesn't sound like anyone's traveling (56:54 - 56:58)
to Pokemon go fast my assumption I'm (56:56 - 56:59)
guessing I would love to hear your (56:58 - 57:01)
guys's thoughts is Pokemon go fest will (56:59 - 57:05)
be something like the genesect event or (57:01 - 57:07)
the regigigas event where you will pay (57:05 - 57:11)
probably 10 bucks you will get some sort (57:07 - 57:14)
of benefits this was the main reason I (57:11 - 57:17)
wanted to try the safari zone event at (57:14 - 57:19)
my house because I wanted to see what (57:17 - 57:21)
that was like and obviously Greg and (57:19 - 57:24)
other people I've talked to who left (57:21 - 57:26)
their house that day they were able to (57:24 - 57:30)
encounter more Pokemon and ideally more (57:26 - 57:32)
shiny pokemon if you care about that (57:30 - 57:35)
because they were seeing more Pokemon by (57:32 - 57:38)
leaving their house that being said in (57:35 - 57:40)
my house during the Safari Zone event I (57:38 - 57:43)
did get non-stop ability to catch (57:40 - 57:44)
Pokemon because the incense was popping (57:43 - 57:48)
every 30 seconds so I did have something (57:44 - 57:50)
to do the entire seven hours I played (57:48 - 57:52)
from home but I understand I probably (57:50 - 57:54)
would have saw more Pokemon if I left (57:52 - 57:56)
but because of how they can make an (57:54 - 57:58)
incense work (57:56 - 58:00)
they can definitely make constant (57:58 - 58:02)
Pokemon spawn in your house if they were (58:00 - 58:05)
to do a paid go fest at home and I don't (58:02 - 58:09)
think it's going to be free no there's (58:05 - 58:11)
no way it's gonna be free some go fast (58:09 - 58:13)
happening at home this year I I know I I (58:11 - 58:16)
think that that's like I agree a hundred (58:13 - 58:20)
percent and they're probably going to (58:16 - 58:23)
find some way to do a version of (58:20 - 58:25)
research tasks that does not require (58:23 - 58:29)
spending poke a stops so that you can do (58:25 - 58:30)
a series of - I mean they can do the the (58:29 - 58:34)
professor ones right just kind of over (58:30 - 58:35)
to you from the professor (58:34 - 58:37)
well the sparse old one was good too (58:35 - 58:39)
because you know take a picture of your (58:37 - 58:40)
Pokemon okay now we all of a sudden you (58:39 - 58:42)
have 100 more great balls (58:40 - 58:44)
like they they kind of figured out how (58:42 - 58:48)
to keep you slightly replenished through (58:44 - 58:50)
easy tests that you can do (58:48 - 58:52)
I would assume if it was like a Pokemon (58:50 - 58:55)
go fest they would be more than sick I (58:52 - 58:56)
think there were six tasks for the (58:55 - 58:59)
safari zone two pages I can say Ted (58:56 - 59:01)
three each I need a reason to interact (58:59 - 59:03)
with the game at this point (59:01 - 59:05)
so a go fest would help with that (59:03 - 59:07)
because right now I mean I'm not (59:05 - 59:10)
interacting with my phone a lot as it is (59:07 - 59:13)
because I'm at home and I have my full (59:10 - 59:15)
computer and I have a switch and I have (59:13 - 59:17)
an Xbox and I have all sorts of other (59:15 - 59:20)
things that keep me entertained and (59:17 - 59:22)
quite frankly I just don't since I'm not (59:20 - 59:25)
walking as much and I'm not downtown (59:22 - 59:28)
where I have a bunch of stops I'm just (59:25 - 59:30)
not interacting with the game I'm just (59:28 - 59:34)
not so having like an event to pull me (59:30 - 59:37)
into it that I can do with y'all is (59:34 - 59:39)
something that I'm interested in and I i (59:37 - 59:41)
don't really care a lot what that looks (59:39 - 59:45)
like as long as it's not incumbent of me (59:41 - 59:49)
traveling around the city and then (59:45 - 59:50)
other thing that people got super (59:49 - 59:53)
excited about was the you'll soon be (59:50 - 59:54)
able to team up with friends and take (59:53 - 59:56)
out and raid battles together in Pokemon (59:54 - 59:58)
go from the comfort of your home (59:56 - 60:00)
literally no clue what that's supposed (59:58 - 60:02)
to look like nope (60:00 - 60:07)
yeah is that like who starts the raid (60:02 - 60:12)
like it is it a situation where you have (60:07 - 60:14)
to be friends with somebody on your list (60:12 - 60:18)
and is it a situation where I can't okay (60:14 - 60:20)
this is this is what I imagined I could (60:18 - 60:23)
be wrong please what I imagined I (60:20 - 60:27)
imagined that they're not bringing raids (60:23 - 60:29)
to your house I don't imagine that (60:27 - 60:30)
there's suddenly gonna be a polka stop (60:29 - 60:32)
at everyone's house or a gym at everyone (60:30 - 60:35)
house what I assume is if me will and (60:32 - 60:37)
Greg are friends and Greg is at a target (60:35 - 60:40)
and there is a cabal ian popping at (60:37 - 60:43)
Target Greg logs into the LA because he (60:40 - 60:45)
he is out and about and at the target (60:43 - 60:50)
the target ball or whatever and then we (60:45 - 60:53)
will and I can then get invites to join (60:50 - 60:57)
that but one person still has to go out (60:53 - 61:01)
and do it and actually see that I I (60:57 - 61:04)
don't think that's it yet I'm seeing (61:01 - 61:06)
thinking more of maybe something like a (61:04 - 61:09)
max raid battle and like star pieces (61:06 - 61:12)
wishing pieces where it's like you can (61:09 - 61:15)
get items through some sort of research (61:12 - 61:17)
tasks or something that allow you to (61:15 - 61:19)
launch a raid from your house and then (61:17 - 61:21)
you can invite people if they want to do (61:19 - 61:23)
this again more in if they want to do (61:21 - 61:25)
this in the next coming weeks cuz they (61:23 - 61:27)
also I think somewhere they said I think (61:25 - 61:28)
it was unread if they replied to (61:27 - 61:30)
somebody saying like oh we just started (61:28 - 61:32)
working on this if the raids already (61:30 - 61:34)
exist and they're already active and (61:32 - 61:36)
they're already on timers and somebody (61:34 - 61:37)
does it (61:36 - 61:41)
it seems easier systematically to just (61:37 - 61:43)
be like let me just invite my three star (61:41 - 61:44)
friends just like I would invite my (61:43 - 61:47)
three star friends to a go fest ticket (61:44 - 61:50)
because the app knows your friendship (61:47 - 61:54)
level between people yeah I mean I could (61:50 - 61:55)
also see them running it like go battle (61:54 - 61:59)
League where there's low-level raids for (61:55 - 62:01)
free that you can do maybe once a day (61:59 - 62:05)
and then if you have a premium pass you (62:01 - 62:09)
can get the higher level raids if you (62:05 - 62:11)
pay for it and then you have the ability (62:09 - 62:13)
to like set up a time and say hey let's (62:11 - 62:17)
all be here I'm gonna send you the code (62:13 - 62:19)
or the invite and I've paid for these (62:17 - 62:23)
raids and it's run like go battle League (62:19 - 62:25)
they still want their dollars though (62:23 - 62:28)
yeah but I mean if you're looking at if (62:25 - 62:30)
you're looking at one-star raids in the (62:28 - 62:32)
one and two sir rates in the first path (62:30 - 62:36)
and four and five star trades in the (62:32 - 62:38)
paid path they're still getting paid (62:36 - 62:40)
yeah my people are still gonna pay for (62:38 - 62:41)
the better (62:40 - 62:44)
raid I'm assuming you still have to be (62:41 - 62:46)
friends with the person I don't yeah I'm (62:44 - 62:47)
absolutely assuming they're going to (62:46 - 62:49)
maximize and use the French the (62:47 - 62:50)
friendslist (62:49 - 62:54)
so I don't think like I can I can plug (62:50 - 62:58)
my iPhone into my Elgato and then stream (62:54 - 63:00)
raids and just like max ray battles that (62:58 - 63:02)
we do on Monday nights I don't imagine (63:00 - 63:03)
that I'm going to be like all right (63:02 - 63:05)
Pokemon go raids everyone watching my (63:03 - 63:08)
stream jump on in I would assume that (63:05 - 63:09)
it's probably restricted to the friends (63:08 - 63:12)
list and you probably what was go fast (63:09 - 63:14)
you had to be at least two star friends (63:12 - 63:18)
which is seven gifts yeah it's like one (63:14 - 63:20)
week one week I just don't see a (63:18 - 63:22)
situation where you're just sitting on (63:20 - 63:26)
your couch doing raids non-stop even if (63:22 - 63:28)
you have the money to do it even if it's (63:26 - 63:31)
like well I can do you know six raids an (63:28 - 63:34)
hour and I'm just gonna spend six (63:31 - 63:36)
dollars six dollars six dollars and four (63:34 - 63:38)
hours later I've spent 24 bucks doing (63:36 - 63:41)
raids non-stop (63:38 - 63:42)
there I feel like there still has to be (63:41 - 63:45)
a trigger of like one per maybe they did (63:42 - 63:46)
maybe there doesn't but then at that (63:45 - 63:49)
point when they take this all away when (63:46 - 63:51)
the world is finally finished and (63:49 - 63:55)
hopefully over this thing do people just (63:51 - 63:57)
do they get burnt out do they not care (63:55 - 64:00)
do they go like well I'm never going to (63:57 - 64:03)
leave a raid again or do does the antic (64:00 - 64:04)
remove the feature and people are like (64:03 - 64:06)
okay this is now worst game like I feel (64:04 - 64:08)
like there still has to be one person (64:06 - 64:12)
doing like going out and activating this (64:08 - 64:15)
I just the the situation of just sitting (64:12 - 64:16)
there doing raids non-stop doesn't seem (64:15 - 64:19)
like the it seems like a very lazy like (64:16 - 64:21)
well we can get our money this way and (64:19 - 64:25)
people can do it and I don't know it (64:21 - 64:27)
just seems like a quick thing to (64:25 - 64:29)
implement and then like a harder thing (64:27 - 64:31)
to remove and like try to justify of (64:29 - 64:32)
like okay now you have to leave to do (64:31 - 64:33)
the same thing you were doing from your (64:32 - 64:36)
couch yeah I mean I don't know who we (64:33 - 64:39)
aren't I mean it's pretty easy saying (64:36 - 64:42)
hey one person still has to go out in (64:39 - 64:48)
the public it isn't a great look (64:42 - 64:50)
right now like yeah yeah that's the (64:48 - 64:52)
problem well I mean they make research (64:50 - 64:54)
any they literally just increase the (64:52 - 64:56)
thing to reach gyms easier though like (64:54 - 65:00)
they don't have to go out in public (64:56 - 65:02)
yeah you still don't have to go out in (65:00 - 65:05)
public to activate a raid right like if (65:02 - 65:08)
you were close enough to a gym so let's (65:05 - 65:09)
just pretend the Burger King next to you (65:08 - 65:14)
will was a gym and the egg popped and (65:09 - 65:17)
you could reach it from your luxurious (65:14 - 65:20)
boutique apartment you could then text (65:17 - 65:22)
me and Greg and you could say oh I see a (65:20 - 65:24)
Landorus popping in 45 minutes are you (65:22 - 65:27)
guys free and then we could be like yeah (65:24 - 65:29)
and then you joined the lobby you invite (65:27 - 65:31)
us and that way there is still some (65:29 - 65:33)
artificial time thing instead of you (65:31 - 65:34)
being like all right you want to do (65:33 - 65:36)
Landorus cool ok you want to do another (65:34 - 65:38)
Lander is cool well well let's just keep (65:36 - 65:39)
doing Landers until we get shiny (65:38 - 65:41)
I'd know Landers can't be shiny that (65:39 - 65:44)
example but like that would be the (65:41 - 65:46)
alternate situation of like let's just (65:44 - 65:48)
keep doing them over I don't think (65:46 - 65:50)
that's the alternate situation I don't (65:48 - 65:52)
think that you'd be able to do them back (65:50 - 65:54)
to back to back if if there's no (65:52 - 65:56)
movement involved I think there is (65:54 - 66:00)
definitely a timer set in place but I (65:56 - 66:01)
mean this thing that you're talking (66:00 - 66:05)
about most people aren't by gyms I mean (66:01 - 66:07)
I don't live next door to an entire art (66:05 - 66:10)
installation I do have to travel for (66:07 - 66:12)
that the situation of oh I can reach it (66:10 - 66:15)
even is extended like I live in a (66:12 - 66:17)
populated area and I still have to (66:15 - 66:20)
travel a mile to get to a gym I still (66:17 - 66:23)
have to do that work I still have to go (66:20 - 66:26)
out in a time when shelter and place (66:23 - 66:30)
orders are everywhere so I don't know (66:26 - 66:33)
that they can say hey you have to one (66:30 - 66:35)
person has to take the risk of going out (66:33 - 66:39)
to find a raid like ethically I don't (66:35 - 66:40)
know that that's a decision they can (66:39 - 66:43)
make I mean the other half of this is (66:40 - 66:45)
that I think anything that they roll out (66:43 - 66:48)
to make the game more playable at home (66:45 - 66:49)
without going out they're not going to (66:48 - 66:51)
roll back (66:49 - 66:54)
so that whatever they do for this raid (66:51 - 66:56)
mechanic for people to be able to do it (66:54 - 66:57)
from home that's that's just gonna be in (66:56 - 67:01)
the game for all time it's a it's a it's (66:57 - 67:02)
a quandary I don't know what they're (67:01 - 67:06)
gonna do but I don't think heading out (67:02 - 67:08)
to find an active raise is going to be a (67:06 - 67:10)
big part of it (67:08 - 67:12)
imagine that they'll say hey you can do (67:10 - 67:16)
one free one from your home a day but if (67:12 - 67:19)
you are able to go out or something they (67:16 - 67:21)
might say then you can do it more yeah (67:19 - 67:25)
that makes sense it's a real weird thing (67:21 - 67:29)
it's who we are in a weird time I have (67:25 - 67:32)
no clue when when like how fast can they (67:29 - 67:33)
get something like this ready though (67:32 - 67:35)
like I feel like something something (67:33 - 67:37)
like the body feature or something (67:35 - 67:40)
Google people they're real smart they (67:37 - 67:42)
can do lots of stuff baby they got (67:40 - 67:43)
nothing but time (67:42 - 67:44)
yeah they're all just sitting at home (67:43 - 67:47)
anyways slamming their keyboards waiting (67:44 - 67:49)
just words that happen if it comes (67:47 - 67:52)
sooner than later cool maybe it maybe (67:49 - 67:54)
it's even simpler than we think maybe (67:52 - 67:56)
it's more complicated I don't know but (67:54 - 67:58)
that's on Niantic labs calm they'll be (67:56 - 67:59)
in the show notes if you want to read it (67:58 - 68:00)
there's some stuff about Harry Potter (67:59 - 68:01)
and what they're doing with Harry Potter (68:00 - 68:03)
there's some stuff about ingress what (68:01 - 68:05)
they're doing with ingress I don't think (68:03 - 68:06)
I read this but it says in areas where (68:05 - 68:07)
it's permitted by local authorities (68:06 - 68:10)
outdoor walks practice with proper (68:07 - 68:12)
social distancing will continue to be a (68:10 - 68:14)
great way to contribute towards your (68:12 - 68:16)
physical and mental health you will be (68:14 - 68:17)
able to still play our games while you (68:16 - 68:19)
do that these changes we are making is (68:17 - 68:21)
an alternative one that is not possible (68:19 - 68:24)
bike rides are good too I saw a lot of (68:21 - 68:26)
people riding riding the bike when I was (68:24 - 68:27)
at when I drove through the park the (68:26 - 68:29)
other day a lot of people playing tennis (68:27 - 68:32)
- yeah that's the one that I'm like hmm (68:29 - 68:35)
but I mean yeah you are a distance apart (68:32 - 68:38)
so I guess that's fine everything else (68:35 - 68:40)
is pretty empty except the tennis courts (68:38 - 68:41)
there was maybe there was like a little (68:40 - 68:43)
mini tennis tournament happening I was (68:41 - 68:47)
like mmm tennis interesting we had some (68:43 - 68:49)
youths playing basketball and I glared (68:47 - 68:50)
at them as I was walking my dogs (68:49 - 68:53)
oh I shout out to Stuart who sent in the (68:50 - 68:55)
championship cancelation news in our (68:53 - 68:59)
attact Channel Pokemon of the week okay (68:55 - 69:01)
clues from last week's Pokemon of the (68:59 - 69:05)
week special edition to this edition (69:01 - 69:08)
spelled a not e Steve actually mentioned (69:05 - 69:10)
the Pokemon of the week earlier in this (69:08 - 69:15)
episode so this Pokemon makes either (69:10 - 69:20)
seven tones or cries which results in (69:15 - 69:22)
ultrasonic waves that have the power to (69:20 - 69:23)
knock foes (69:22 - 69:26)
lying is a suction cup on the top of its (69:23 - 69:31)
head cannot learn fly but it only has (69:26 - 69:33)
the ability levitate no other abilities (69:31 - 69:36)
first appeared in Ruby and Sapphire last (69:33 - 69:37)
time it actually appeared in a game (69:36 - 69:39)
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire (69:37 - 69:44)
interestingly enough does not have a (69:39 - 69:46)
particular type ink that it would have (69:44 - 69:51)
from looking at its physical form its (69:46 - 69:56)
stage 100 in Pokemon shuffle and it used (69:51 - 69:57)
to be able to be picked up with a (69:56 - 69:59)
cleanse tag which is a particularly (69:57 - 70:07)
useless item who is that Pokemon it's (69:59 - 70:11)
chatot oh you're the worst he got it (70:07 - 70:12)
right this time (70:11 - 70:14)
let's just give it to him whatever throw (70:12 - 70:16)
the script out the window it's chata (70:14 - 70:22)
yeah that's right finally I knew it was (70:16 - 70:26)
time ago you did gyro (70:22 - 70:29)
correct Chimecho is that is the answer (70:26 - 70:32)
Chimecho is a combination of chime and (70:29 - 70:43)
eken my national pokedex number and the (70:32 - 70:45)
number of episodes in which it first (70:43 - 70:48)
appeared is the same 358 do you think (70:45 - 70:49)
that's ever on purpose do you think (70:48 - 70:50)
that's just like some like coincidence (70:49 - 70:53)
that is not on purpose they record those (70:50 - 70:54)
things so out of order (70:53 - 70:58)
chime echoes index number is the very (70:54 - 71:00)
last in gen3 include excluding glitch (70:58 - 71:04)
Pokemon like unknown except in Pokemon (71:00 - 71:07)
Gale of Darkness which this trade one of (71:04 - 71:09)
the greatest games ever belongs the (71:07 - 71:10)
munchlax (71:09 - 71:12)
that's like the weirdest trivia I make (71:10 - 71:14)
us based on I wouldn't understand what (71:12 - 71:17)
that means in each Pokemon game of (71:14 - 71:19)
generation three all Pokemon have an (71:17 - 71:21)
unseen index number to identify them in (71:19 - 71:24)
the games ROM the majority of them are (71:21 - 71:26)
in the National pokedex order in fact (71:24 - 71:30)
Pokemon 0 0 1 2 250 1 inclusive are in (71:26 - 71:31)
the same position they are in the (71:30 - 71:32)
National Dex (71:31 - 71:34)
it is important to note that unknown (71:32 - 71:36)
data is stored in the index number is (71:34 - 71:39)
201 meaning that the index number 413 2 (71:36 - 71:43)
439 unknown be 2 question mark are empty (71:39 - 71:44)
spaces which are occupied only by (71:43 - 71:47)
sprites unknown letters are determined (71:44 - 71:50)
by their personality value and different (71:47 - 71:53)
sprites index number 413 2 439 depending (71:50 - 71:56)
on personality value however in Gallup (71:53 - 71:57)
darkness the unknown letters have been (71:56 - 71:59)
moved to the index number 4 or 15 to 4 (71:57 - 72:02)
or 41 to make room for bond sly and (71:59 - 72:05)
munchlax come on did you know that I (72:02 - 72:09)
guess I kind of understand now somewhat (72:05 - 72:11)
so for whatever reason Chimecho (72:09 - 72:15)
appears after deoxys in the index number (72:11 - 72:18)
is well before that possibly because (72:15 - 72:21)
Chimecho much like masculine was an (72:18 - 72:24)
afterthought oh my gosh and then we need (72:21 - 72:28)
more wind chime exactly another psychic (72:24 - 72:32)
pokémon guys more cowbell (72:28 - 72:32)
all right is there any other Chimecho (72:32 - 72:36)
trivia no no this literally that's it (72:33 - 72:40)
all right James had one I believe that (72:36 - 72:42)
is he had one for a short period of time (72:40 - 72:43)
you are correct (72:42 - 72:46)
all right this week's Pokemon this is (72:43 - 72:49)
gonna be a shorter one either it's gonna (72:46 - 72:51)
be very easy for you or it's gonna be (72:49 - 72:53)
real hard for you that's sometimes (72:51 - 72:56)
that's just the way the chips fall here (72:53 - 72:59)
we go this Pokemon falls squarely into (72:56 - 73:02)
the type least appreciated by Greg even (72:59 - 73:04)
though it is debatable whether it should (73:02 - 73:07)
I don't know what the term is for people (73:04 - 73:09)
who do not like artificial constructed (73:07 - 73:11)
life-forms but I will use the term (73:09 - 73:16)
biologist Greg is a biologist this (73:11 - 73:18)
week's Pokemon has a unique ability not (73:16 - 73:21)
seen in any other Pokemon the ability (73:18 - 73:24)
very simply increases its special attack (73:21 - 73:27)
every time another Pokemon faints very (73:24 - 73:29)
few people know of this ability because (73:27 - 73:32)
in most competitions you cannot use this (73:29 - 73:35)
week's Pokemon while it has existed for (73:32 - 73:38)

can be used to spell anagram if you (73:50 - 73:56)
leave one letter out I wonder if the (73:53 - 73:58)
