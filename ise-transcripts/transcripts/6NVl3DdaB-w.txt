[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 436th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective here again it is me hi greg greg also here you could sound more excited that i'm here i bring you the heat you're like oh i guess i'm here greg is here too i guess i'm i'm thrilled [Music] i want to hear some spice in your voice i want to hear some it's been a week i get to talk to you in person that sort of energy that that i bring to the table every time i go i got energy we got things to talk about today no no will will is uh traveling which is probably better before thanksgiving than after thanksgiving some would say i guess true [Music] look you're talking to a person that does not want to leave his house right now and hasn't for like a week and a half so yeah it's uh bobby's here hey uh and apparently i'm a sucker according to greg yeah you're the pokemon go sucker kind of how many how many a how many incubators have you bought since the last time okay i only bought i only bought two yesterday to hatch the magma the shiny or the magbees and i did get one the shiny one so that was exciting so many remote raid passes have you purchased how many oh i don't want to talk about remote grade passes in way too deep on remote raid passes see so here's the question on the table was i wrong no [Music] you're not wrong i just don't like to admit it that's all i feel like that's the common theme with most pokemon fans look i pulled bravery so there you go but what did that cost you what did that cost you greg zero because i only use the the pitiful stream of gems they give me in game i don't think greg is saying such control spend any money masters i spent ten dollars once oh did you do the for the like permanent incubator right no no this is way back when there was i was testing pull rates i think i was doing something stupid i was seeing the difference between paid gym like if there was an actual difference between paid gyms and non-paid gym spoiler alert there wasn't but i figured you know i was having enough fun at that time oh to go back to talk to myself that i thought oh i'll give them ten dollars for this game i should have not done that there there is a bit of pokemon go news we got some pokemon masters news we got some cafe mix but we're going to start with some sword and shield news here [Music] by the time this podcast goes up this will be over but another month another raid event in sword and shield so uh overall pretty happy they keep doing this this is off pokemon.com they actually didn't tweet this at least that i saw over the weekend i was waiting for them to tweet it i don't think they did uh maybe there's too much on the social media plate i guess too many memes to tweet before tweeting this but it's tracked down shiny squivet in and more in max raid battles the very loving pokemon is the star of a weekend long event in sword and shield somebody was uh really happy to write this first sentence things are getting nuts in pokemon sword and shield from thursday november 19th from 4 to sunday november 22nd to 4 pst will appear more frequently in max ray battles while you're battling this cheeky pokemon you'll have a better chance of encountering a shiny squivet uh the data miners and sarah b said that was two percent in five star raids during they tweeted it oh they did tweet it okay on the 20th oh wow they tweeted it earlier i was i was expecting the the the saturday tweet oh it was ahead of the memes yeah way ahead of their memes they had to go through a lot of memes to get to this they do like four a day they do a lot yeah they do they just won um the people who uh run the social media i think just won an award for it for yeah i saw that that was exciting during the event you also notice the increased number of cherubi amungus schnattic ingredient these pokemon are very hungry uh because berries are plentiful and that's pretty much it uh so the rewards for this was actually really good uh they rewarded a bunch of the berries that re reduced your evs um if you want if you were into competitive battling so it's always nice one to do raids that feel like an event and two it's nice when the rewards are good even if you don't get a shiny you still feel like you're not wasting your time also you got to max knuckle giant squirrels in the face all i did all weekend and i never had a single shiny appear in my game no shiny for you bobby are you i mean i've caught them i've got them in others but all of my dens were just normal cheeks that i blasted into the universe uh i haven't no i didn't actually haven't played sword and shield in a little while um i was playing and i still need to go back actually and get the rest of the pikachu uh gifts before november 30th but uh you are running out of time sir bobby we talked about this i know we totally talked about this and i do we've talked about this multiple weeks well i ordered i got an xbox series s last week and so i've been kind of there's no games on that there's no new games on it but i haven't had an xbox in years so i've been actually playing old xbox games or does it pretend to play i think it plays old ones yeah it put well i have the uh that series s doesn't have a disc drive so it's all digital you can like redownload games you purchased before on the xbox one and stuff and play those so it works i i have to put on uh a tinfoil hat theory here for the squivet raids there has been a lot of these this year obviously the first time they did like a promoted raid event was over christmas last year which was like the deli bird but there was no shiny deli bird it was just here's a bunch of deli birds and i think deli bird was dropping some item that people wanted so it was like worth it to do it was dropping a lot of the xl candy yeah it was a lot of candies a lot of candy and then like two weeks after that they did the new year's eve magikarp event which everyone lost their mind for because it was like non-stop shiny magikarps it was like one in eight chance of getting a shiny magikarp and it was magikarp and i think magikarp was dropping really good rewards too i think it was dropping a lot of candy as well so you're just like no the magikarp was dropping money it was dropping like nuggets and stuff yeah yeah nuggets big yeah nuggets i feel like they didn't do anything until the like starter stuff where they put squirtle bulbasaur charmander and mewtwo into raids and that was like end of february early march um and that was good because i remember that was dropping life orb fire orb and toxic orb if i remember yeah but you couldn't catch the mewtwo or something right yeah you couldn't catch the me too and it was difficult the first day until everybody figured out what you had to do yes right right people like rates and mmos people were bringing their shinies to flex and then me too would just destroy them and some people still brought their chinese to flex and the rest of us had to carry you yeah vince and then um there was there was a bunch that kind of started early summer late spring which was the pikachu event which was in august and then there was like the wailord event that was in september and then there was the gorgeous event last month and then there was a clefable event somewhere in there somewhere that might have been so yeah somewhere there there's a clefable event um but not every month this year had the event there was also the zero horror event in june but in all those events they've like changed the catch rate and they've done this before so like magikarp was like pretty much guaranteed whether you were a guest or a host because it's a magikarp it's pretty easy to catch pikachu seemed pretty easy to catch for both guests and hosts the whale lord seemed kind of hard for everyone to catch because like waylord has like a i mean technically whaler has a harder catch rate than a magikarp or pikachu uh i don't remember the fable that well uh gore guys seemed pretty easy i like i don't think i failed the gorgeous when i found it shiny i don't think i failed the gorgeous when i was a guest either because i was using repeat balls but for this event anyways for this event it seemed almost impossible to catch a squivet which outside of raids squabbit has the same catch rate as like a pidgey or uh rattata like squabbit has the best catch rate which is 255. but if you were a host and it was shiny and this is and sarah b i believe tweeted this if you it if it was shiny and you were the host it was guaranteed for you no matter what and i tested that over the weekend on my twitch streams with my viewers and they were throwing premier balls or poke balls or like dream balls and if they were the host and it was shiny i don't think any no one failed it there was very very very very few people as a guest who went to try to catch it and failed even with something like a repeat ball which should be a 100 catch rate on a 255 pokemon but obviously promoted raids can adjust catch races catch rate catch rates like we're talking about but yeah i i even failed to squive it shiny squivet repeat ball is like the best chance better than like a dust ball and everything um and it didn't work and sounds like greg you had that issue as well yes uh i've had i had multiple repeat ball failures in other people's rates because i never found one on my own so i can't confirm about the 100 catch right in your own but uh yeah i failed i failed a lot it's very frustrating because i've seen a lot of shinies and i only have a few but yeah repeat paul should have been i'm like it's just a squove it like yeah super easy to catch just no it's not it's just a rot one squirrel so my my tin foil hat theory is now game freak is mad about people with past the events so we've talked about like you you you can like guarantee a shiny in a in a raid by you know moving your clock forward and so when these events happen instead of people going and doing raids they'll just move the clock forward find it and then host it for people maybe they changed it or they or this is just a weird coincidence to well we don't want people hosting anymore because then people aren't actually playing they're just looking for somebody hosting it and then they're just like even even if you're not a person that normally hosts you could be like well i found it and i'm gonna keep resetting it until all my like seven friends get it and then we're done for the weekend because the host would just have to turn their game on or you know quit the raid the as long as the host doesn't catch it'll still exist but if they changed it to well guests have a very small chance of catching and the host is guaranteed to catch it then you're not incentified incentivized to host and your friends are now incentivized to find their own and help out yeah this is that's exactly what i thought as soon as you started talking about this catch rate yeah but it doesn't work that way like people are still gonna host and keep it open until everybody gets it it just takes longer of course but i bet like i could see that someone hosting being just less likely to do it thinking like well i just i'm gonna just gonna catch it first anyways and it could take hours for my friends to all catch it so they can just go get their own yeah but it's still only a two percent chance of finding one so the catch rate is still higher than finding one on your own so if it if you have your friends do it for over an hour guarantee for your friends in that hour we'll catch it whereas i spent all weekend trying to find one in my game over multiple hours and i never found one how many wishing pieces you think you burned through uh i think i burned through 30 because i just don't spend it on pushing pieces i was like i'll do it just once and then i was like nope i'm done and i did find a bunch of five stars but they just weren't shiny i probably went through like 200 pieces oh my gosh um i don't think that they it's like a foolproof plan i mean like obviously the biggest the best thing would be just if they just fix the issue um but i think it might just be something that they could at least test and see uh you know what happens i mean maybe they come back from this and they're like oh nothing changed so they go on doing their thing but um it's definitely more of an inconvenience for the host right right because like they have to keep resetting and as long as they were doing that anyways well yeah just for a longer amount of time though it's just longer yeah just longer because we don't know what the actual like like sarah b never tweeted like the guest have a five percent catch right right we don't know i know i know she tweeted though the worst or something yeah i don't know tweeted like i don't know what the worst chance or something is though is the worst like a one percent uh no i don't know he like literally said the words like if you're hosting it's guaranteed if you're a guest it's and then the words he said were like the worst chances are or something like the least chance or something like that he's very awkwardly turning into the pokemon company by not just saying numbers yeah he didn't say numbers he used a phrase like terrible chances or something like that i think if if you were if you were somebody that was hosting every one of these events the clefable the waylord the pikachu the whatever and now all of a sudden you have to do it a lot more times if it takes longer and it's on the weekend and it's right before a holiday in america at least people are gonna do it okay so so your argument is this is not affecting the people that are already resetting here okay but what i mean okay but that i still think that was the maybe the potential uh attempt from i think that's maybe what they thought but i don't think that's what happened but what about the people joining so i i would i would argue those people are even more lazy because they they're they're not turning off their game and setting their clock forward like however many times to do it for shiny they're just looking for the hand me out and i get this all the time on twitch or somebody will come in and they'll be like hey is anyone hosting we i got this this weekend right it wasn't a lot it was more it was more um when sword and shield first came out but people would come in and they'd be like is anyone hosting this event i'm looking for the shiny and so if assuming tin foil hat they did this to crack down on that those people might be like oh this is taking too long i've done this like seven times and i haven't caught the scroll of it i'm just gonna give up and or i'm just gonna look for it myself it could affect those people it could but i mean we have to we're dealing against the time sync problem too like once you cross the limit of i've done this seven times well i've already done this so many times i'm already so far down this path i'm gonna keep going until i get it like there's equal chances that they're gonna bail as they are gonna hunker down until they get it because now they're mad at it like both are in play i don't think this worked as they intended it to i think it was a test i don't think it did probably what they think what they were thinking it would do because i thought people were like i'm having it open for the next 24 hours just let me know and i'll give you a code okay cool yeah for somebody like me who's playing every day it's really easy for me to like go to the isle of armor go to the beach where like the three raid dens are literally sitting next to each other and just go in this triangle of dropping wishing pieces wishing pieces are if you're not playing every day and you're not you're not collecting watts you might not have like an inventory of like 500 wishing pieces just sitting and now that i'm like low on wishing pieces i know that like they're probably going to do an event for december so i'm going to check all my right dens every day i'm going to visit digging paw and i'm going to stock up on watts to get more wishing pieces so when december comes i'm not wasting time grinding watts i'm just wasting time throwing wishing pieces in a hole uh for whatever thing pops up assuming there is a december event i found joe's tweet it was actually not serebii it was joe's personal account uh the catch rate of the shiny squad is hosting guaranteed joining lowest chance yeah i have did did it say shiny squibbit uh shiny squibby okay yeah cause if it was a five star regular squabbit and your host it was not guaranteed catch right but he did say shawnee okay yeah he said the catch rate of the shiny squeal of it hosting guaranteed joining lowest chance the lowest chance like legendary like you left that on one percent i mean it can't have been that low or i was very lucky because i did not do that that many shiny dens in all and told and i have i would say i would say i got in 10 shiny dens and i caught three that's not terrible not terrible it's not squibbit not typical squabbit catch right but it's not terrible but it's also also i never found a shiny den in my game this entire weekend doing it myself i found one yeah i found one myself and i did about 200 wishing pieces that's a lot of wishing pieces yeah it is well i mean i found a lot of five star squibbets it's just the only one which i didn't only never find anything that were shiny so ironically my very first five star swell it was the shiny one and then i didn't find anything so wow keep it coming back yeah i used my luck up right away this is off digital informationworld.com why do you go to these garbage sites the best sources on what look it had the article it had the news i needed the news from digital information what digitalinformationworld.com wowzers their title is call of duty mobile and among us will fight for the title of best mobile game 2020. now the reason i pulled this article is because the nominees for the game award 2020 is no surprise call of duty has grabbed a spot in the best mobile game category however there's tough competition let's let's be clear here they say that i'm reading from digital information they said there's tough competition coming from inner sloths breakout title among us sure i mean among us is two years old but okay oh yeah but nobody heard about it until this year does that mean it's a breakout like yeah it's kind of like it's kind of like best new artist at the grammys when it's like that person's been recording music for like 15 years okay all right all right that's fair there are other popular titles on the list the ones that i brought that the reason i bought brought up this article is the other titles on the list are genshin impact legends of runeterra and pokemon cafe mix are nominated to go head-to-head against call of duty and among us in the most popular category this uh this author is very very uh set on the other three not having a chance here i mean i've just gotten into gungeon impact which is dangerous yeah i saw an ad for that and thought i think you had mentioned it a couple podcasts ago so i immediately thought of you yeah i was finally convinced i was finally convinced to download it and it is very very very pretty yeah that's that's the number one danger sign of me playing a game just goes in and describes all the games uh genji impact is a gotcha game uh legends of runeterra is a free-to-play digital collectible card game made by riot and then cafe mix is the game that i refuse to play because i don't want to turn my phone sideways you are yeah that's uh just the worst reason to not play a game honestly i mean it really is it's so it makes zero sense also like your palm kind of covers the speaker on the iphone at least how are you holding your phone your palm cups it and makes the speaker point the sound at you no i would say my phone is my hand right now i would say that the uh what's the like the thing about right below your index finger that's like that for me overlaps the speaker because i want to put my index fingers to wrap around the top of the phone i want to hold it like a playstation controller don't understand how you're holding your phone well i can't take a picture of me holding my phone when i'm holding the phone i need another phone to do that well get irene in all right hold my phone take a picture of me holding the phone and then send it to you thank you so what i'm gathering here and take it back to a line from apple is that you're just holding the phone wrong yeah yeah probably and then you use like your middle fingers to like put it behind the phone for like stability what do we have the same fingers yeah well i i hope you are missing fingers no where are you okay so we can't have this conversation we literally cannot have this conversation i'm holding my phone right now in front of me me too uh so best mobile games among us call of duty mobile genshin impact legends of runeterra and pokemon cafe mix i mean who's running the who's the game awards the game awards is the game awards the gameawards.com but who are they like the about here i'll click the about uh it's run by jeff keely it was founded in 2014 by media in trip entrepreneur jeff keeley who has also hosted other things best known for working with entertainment weekly spike tv g4 and youtube spike tv and g4 winners of networks he's got 1.2 million followers on twitter uh there's a board of directors that has uh somebody from activision somebody from ea somebody from epic somebody from amd somebody from stadia kojima is on the board rockstar riot i don't know this is like the they said okay these people are on the advisory boards and their games are up for awards this is a conflict of interest i'm calling ethics violations on this whole thing uh yeah i mean he's been doing this for what like eight years now he said 2014 right yeah that's six years oh yeah six years i don't know why i thought it was in my mind it's 20 22. and everything except for how you hold your phone yeah clearly clearly not that it's uh yeah i i feel like cafe mix was like we just need to throw something up here maybe is cafe mix actually that good i think cafe mix is that popular i i mean when i when i was playing it regularly it was very fun it's a fun puzzle game and it's very cute like if you take the two seconds to turn your phone the right way which the game does automatically for you you just actually need to physically move your hand for approximately half a second to get it in the right position you would see that the game is kind of fun i'll get around to it maybe no you won't i'm gonna get i'm gonna text irene right now to say take a picture of how you hold your phone i actually haven't played cafe mix yet but i'm going to download it and play it just because steve won't play it yeah i installed it i installed it too i just i never actually ended up playing it it's no magikarp joke a perfect vertical game some would say how how is that perfect it was a cookie clicker yeah i might i'm into that well we've seen your trips i love trims this is off uh spencer sent this in the stuff that while pokemon masters tweeted it and it's on their instagram uh i'll just sum it up real quick they showed a trailer sword and shield people are coming two pokemon shield is coming to pokemon masters that's exciting right it breathes a little life into the game yeah you guys were worried a little bit about it well weeks ago well adding new characters doesn't i wouldn't say breathe life into the game it breathes money into the game well that's money equals life in mobile game worlds uh a lot of the comments i'm reading are people thinking it's gloria and based on like there's a howl in the trailer i'm really bad at like any time there's like audio hints in a trailer i can never hear them i haven't you got the speaker of your phone covered with your hands that's true yeah that's that's why i always have to keep it vertical because my ears are sensitive i can't remember if people were saying it was amazing or zashian but i guess like if they're doing gloria and victor i guess they're probably gonna give them zamasa tanzashian which is weird because like who are they giving the starters to if they decide to do that because hop wouldn't get a starter hop would get double yeah well yeah you're right i don't know yeah i don't know i mean i can hear i played the thing and i can hear the howl i don't know which howl that is other howls different yeah their halls are different is there youtube about the house is there owl sure there is probably and gloria is the is the female avatar right yeah she's the female protagonist well who do they usually give the starters to the protagonist yeah usually yeah like lyra has the chikorita and then ethan has cyndaquil and then um brendan has trico right yeah brendan has strico chris has total dial somebody has told how chris does chris that's so dial and you know red blue and green have all the starters right right okay whether or not they bring gen eight trainers to pokemon masters their people will continue to be upset that deanthe is still not in the game which i don't understand who are these people she's the greatest she's such a bad she is so good she's one of the best champions she has patrat has more character development oh you are so wrong in black and white then deanthe has an x and y you because you don't read you skip past story there's nothing you're like rory yeah there he is she comes up she shows up in a cafe with lysander and they try to do this thing of like this isn't possibly the guy the guy wearing all red isn't possibly the guy that's in charge of team flair and she says she goes excuse me young person mr p big d how whatever nickname these bad characters gave you i gotta go shoot a movie and then you don't see her for like 30 hours because she's got a life steve yeah she's shooting a movie she's literally told you where she's gonna be like hanging out when n shows up every five seconds it's all about end so you finally have a champion it's like i'm gonna live my own life and you can do whatever i'm gonna show you how awesome i am i have a career i am taking care of myself i'll be back later and you're like that's terrible but the person that shows up every five seconds you're also like he's the worst the game's just about end there's no pleasing you let me tell you let me tell you my favorite movie star in the pokemon world bryson man bryson has he he is even courteous enough to take you on set deantha doesn't show me where she works because i believe and i will quote this from you i hate this movie set why do they make me do this i want to skip it this is so awful this takes so much time why am i doing this nobody ever comes back here yeah you hurt bryson's feelings and bryson then went and told deanthe like yeah don't don't take that guy to your cool set because he'll just spit in your face for being kind and say that this is the worst experience of his life so don't do it and she's like oh yeah i i can i can smell the desperation on that kid yeah she understands nah i got my own life to lead i'll be back later when it's important when you are worthy of my time uh deep cuts from pokemon real real question because i i i played x and y pretty recently and i don't remember does she actually show up like halfway through the story i know she shows up like when you meet lysander in the cafe when you first arrive to lumios but i don't remember the second time she shows up but i think she does show up one more she does she shows up one other time or oh god i haven't played it since when did those games come out 2012 looks like she meets you again in [Music] co-marine city yeah co-marine is that the one with the docking stations there's a bunch of boats yeah yeah the other one with all the boats yeah yep yes jackson and you're halfway through are you worthy nope you're not okay i'm out i got some stuff to film i got a couple commercials to get done [Laughter] all right all right all right let's uh let's take a break and when we come back we'll go through the uh as niantic says the biggest update to pokemon go ever and the worst name ever yeah we will be right back [Music] but uh your your your player character in this game is called chase chase and the female character is called [Music] elaine [Music] elaine [Music] like you got trace you got chase and elaine [Music] [Music] and we are back all right we got a bit of pokemon go news so let's try to get through this together we can we can do this niantic will be proud uh this is all gonna be off pokemongolive.com uh first bit of news i think is some good news here i will start with the good news ah i think this is all pretty good news so this was on friday or sorry thursday thursday evening to continue adapting to the changing global environment and response to the situation becoming more difficult for many of our players we are returning the following bonus beginning thursday november 19th increased effectiveness of uh in incense effectiveness will be increased now attracting pokemon to you more often your buddy will now bring you more gifts each day up to five game gifts at once up to three times a day i don't know what's happening in here maybe you're maybe you've paid attention to your buddy greg he's my best buddy we play every day i just got a sticker on stabilized forehead which is the weirdest place to have him to put it but whatever yeah there it is oh the ribbon yeah it's on his head yes that's what they did with the box fly they just slapped it on his head and i was like i'm i'm into this farfetch'd has it probably on his chest everything else has another chest except for stabilize like oink these bonuses are temporary but they will remain in the game through at minimum through june of 2021 and we will give at least one month's notice before they change monday they're changing that's uh that's good that's better than the i don't know what was maybe 24 hour notice that we had that they were going away last time so that's nice when we covered the news of them removing those two bonuses uh was like exactly a month ago yes that sounds about right was it only been a month really that those bonuses was it only this month that the bonuses were gone no i think they went in two months worth right okay yeah i think in september uh yes because they updated the original article so if i if i go to the url it says 2020 0 9 29 so a little over a month so only october yeah so that was they would oh yeah most of december i mean it was a month oh and most of november month and a half yeah right right yeah i forgot what month we were in i i thought it was 20 22 about 20 minutes ago yeah well i haven't left my house in like eight months so everything looks the same oh wait i moved a month ago but other than that i totally left myself completely picking up everything and moving it to a different house i haven't left the house i i still stand by that niantic gets so much flack for this kind of stuff but no one ever blames like the pokemon company well if niantic was to be like hey we're gonna remove the if like september 30th or whatever they were like we're gonna remove the incense and what was the other thing the buddy stuff and the pokemon company didn't step in and say like no don't do that to our players our own customers that can also probably buy merch and watch the anime and we don't want to make like what is happening between these two companies where it took them 45 days to be like you know that decision was bad like is it actually just like a translation barrier is it just because everyone's working at home and they like send an email and no one checks that email for like two weeks like why like i would i would maybe bet if if the pokemon company was an american company we wouldn't have to wait so long for simple changes to happen but maybe maybe i don't know maybe maybe we would i think because they have to look at it on a global perspective and make a decision that's for everybody so i guarantee you that niantic has to make the decision looking at their global numbers run the numbers then send it to the pokemon company and then they're going to check everything again and then send it back like there's no way that's happening in under three weeks yeah i mean yeah you're looking at like i mean they're looking at month-end numbers right right uh you know i can tell you as an accountant like it takes time to like get those official i mean you're not just you don't want to just throw estimates at them and be like well this was this or this did that and so i mean i could see it being like a month to realize like oh this just we took a hit because of this um i don't know i mean if you look at the how the world is doing right now i guess you don't need a month to look at that and be like maybe we should put those bonuses back in the game yeah but uh i mean i mean i would have argued they shouldn't have made the decision in the first place like when they cut it off the trend was really bad but if it took them 45 days to get to this point does that mean it took them 45 days to decide hey let's start removing so if they get a bonus on october 1st that means they would have started talking about it but things were a lot better yep which would have been like july wait august like august 15th because august 15th yeah and august it was looking better yeah for sure it was probably even before that to be honest because that to pla planning to like remove a feature like that i don't think that has to do so much with um like it's not as monetary as i think they were just like well we want to get the game kind of back to to where it was before that was probably a decision made a while ago as they saw the the pandemic kind of not being as bad as it was in like march april but it was still i don't know it's never been like good uh but i think that that decision was made quite a while ago and then immediately when that had when that happened and they got all the backlash uh they were like oops we need to look into reversing this the only other thing that i can think of of like why this took so long to re-vert that's the right word is because they were arguing of like well well what are we doing in the future and if the argument was a bunch of people in a boardroom or on a zoom call saying well let's revisit it in march and then be somebody be like no let's do april and then finally i guess they decided june which is i feel extremely generous but maybe not but saying that the bonuses will remain in the game minimum through june of 2021 it doesn't seem like a light decision it seems like there was probably some back and forth probably but i think there's a few things that could lead to a decision like that one being um the i don't think that they're losing a whole i mean they're probably making more money right they're making more money with these things being in game the way they are i mean people are buying more incense because they are getting because it's so much better um and to be fair uh when they did remove the bonus you know they didn't say it but like it was it didn't remove it back to five minutes for every spawn it was like 90 seconds per spawn right so like even sitting on my couch i was still getting a spawn every 90 seconds and that was a nice little surprise after being you know it was a little roller coaster of emotion of like oh i took these bonuses away i'm so bummed and then like oh well it's not that bad it you know every 90 seconds and you know how to fix that clear communication okay so that was that's the thing i think the biggest thing isn't removing features or whether what are they doing with features it's the communication of it all so if like they said now they're gonna give a month's notice before they decide to take this away that was great that would be really great to have a month's notice to be okay in a month these things are going to revert and now we're ready for it versus 24 hours when i may have bought a bunch of incense in the last day because i'm thinking oh i'm gonna buy some incense for the next week or whatever right like a month is a good amount of time to know something's gonna go away also i think that a time frame like june i don't remember if the data was out yet already when this when this decision was made but like i mean that's kind of an idea of like vaccine for stuff for the pandemic but like it's widely going to be potentially available so maybe there was ideas of like that might be a safe bet is to like go middle of next year oh i was thinking july is their big month so we roll back all the changes in june yeah but i don't i don't know if it makes a whole lot of sense from a standpoint like from that standpoint to roll everything back because i feel like rolling everything back in june when july's your big month you're betting that like all of a sudden everyone's gonna be like okay now we're all just gonna go outside yeah well they are making bad bets for sure yeah do you think that like we get go fest in july i think we get some kind of in-person one maybe definitely a virtual one i can see in person one i can see a go fest in person just because it's outside as a verse versus like a pax or an e3 which is like indoors right i think that it also depends just where we are i heard a sigh from greg i just the problem is it would be outdoors but the oh like if things aren't going to change you can't have it be hours and hours and hours right so you can probably safely get away with an hour outdoors but you still have to limit the amount of people there like oh yeah yeah everything that's here i mean to be fair when we were at go fest in chicago it was pretty easy not to be by anyone yeah yeah so if they were to pick the same location until you went over to the trade area and they're all okay yeah so yes the trade area and the spooky area was probably the biggest but there was in the middle there was that like swamp land in between the trade area and the friends where it was like all muddy and gray where like no one was but nobody like trudged through it to get to the um but they could pick an area that big and they could literally just invite half the amount of people and you would have probably 20 feet around you at all times i mean obviously unless you're playing with your own friend group which is the same situation on the plane which is don't sit by anyone unless they're your friends or family that you are traveling with then you are allowed to sit in the center seat if not you are not allowed to sit in the center seat it's just still not whatever yeah there's a lot of compromises to all of this um i mean i think it's hopeful to say that they'll be able to have an outdoor event july of next year i think that is the absolute best case everything goes right over these next six months for that to happen and that's definitely trended well in 2020 huh yeah i mean we have to sort of be honest as to what the vaccine is right how quickly it can be produced and the fact that the general public won't even begin to see the first hint of it until may of next year right exactly like unless there's some major like a million things go right between now and then that is that is a far off hope that they'll be able to have an in-person event next year so similar to a lot of things that happened are happening currently do i think they should have an event in person no do i think they will have an event in person probably so well they had to cancel the kyoto event which they they tweeted about i think niantic support tweeted about i mean the official japanese pokemon go tweeted that i don't really probably no reason for the american pokemon go to tweet hey this japanese effect is cancelled was that the city tour one that was the city tour one so there was four city tours we talked about those last week the taiwan um auckland the kyoto and then i can't remember the last one but the kyoto one got cancelled i want to say japan had 500 cases in a single day which is the highest it's been since i want to june or maybe yeah they spiked um on the 19th which is and it just keep it just keep it getting worse like they had been weighed down in over the summer but again everywhere had been way down over the summer months so like in the southern hemisphere where they're hitting summer they will i'll probably be fine right well you've got like new zealand where auckland where there's no cases or very like very very digit cases but they are very like they do things that nobody else in the world is doing so right no absolutely but again this goes back to the pokemon company has to approve these decisions if if niantic was like hey we want to do four city events in four cities that seem relatively safe one of the cities being like uh in japan and the pokemon company says yes we approve these cities they're at a base level i mean they're agreeing to let niantic do this yeah so if they're okay with doing smaller city events now when it's the worst it's been i just i'm not saying i agree with it i'm just it just seems very likely that they will definitely try tr they as the pokemon company and niantic try to do events i mean we already saw excluding niantic we've already saw the pokemon company tweet that they're trying to get the tcg back up in japan with the like the tcg glass shield things like the they look like you're like you went to prison and like you you're sitting one person's in jail the other person's not and you're like arguing about like who's getting the kids in the next weekend and and they've they've also rolled out like new rules for the tcg where like instead of your opponent cutting your deck they will they will like point at a thing of how many times they want you to cut it in front of them i mean i i think they'll try and most likely just like the kyoto event it will be cancelled yeah i don't know i mean i just don't i just don't think that in six more months it will be in control right at least in control enough to be having like a a massive event a massive i will say in six months it will be in control in every country but the united states also a somewhat safe well now we we can all point to sweden [Laughter] okay uh this is uh this is their their biggest update here this is what they say not me um not me don't even confuse that this is coming from me i would never say these things trainers since we began our journey together over four years ago pokemon go has evolved in many ways from the addition of battles raid battles trainer battles team rocket go but a team go rocket battles to the discovery of over 600 different pokemon that can be encountered in the game the world of pokemon go has changed and expanded in new ways the week of monday november 30th pokemon go will go beyond we'll be making changes to how trainers can level up and implementing seasons a new way to experience in-game events but not only that but pokemon originally discovered in the kalos region will be coming to pokemon go let's start with the the these are the three things the the level the level cap the seasons and the kalos pokemon let's just start with the callous pokemon because i don't think there's really a lot here starting uh wednesday december 2nd uh we'll be meeting pokemon first discovered in the region where dreams and adventures begin kalos i don't think that's true well uh with the a recent recent arrival of mega pokemon omega evolution of pokemon go it feels timely that pokemon originally discovered in the kalos region the region where mega evolution were first discovered will make their debut deck yeah sure okay i don't know the problem with this is like it's i don't know who to blame just this the state of how they have to like conduct their mobile game but it's like it's like five pokemon they said over 20 but like 20 are not appearing it's like five and then you have to evolve them so it's chest pain yeah it's it's seven okay all right yeah you're right it's seven chest pin fennekin froakie bunnelby fletchling lit leo and then klefki klefki will be biggersby though exclusive to france what um look let france have something no why why why do we have to let france have something i want a key we got the statue of liberty they got klefki they gave us the statue of liberty and we're giving them kluffke japan's giving them klemke you're right yes you're actually right japan probably made that decision it was probably masuda themself [Laughter] um they can have zucchini they also this is off uh i've also seen that there's like a there will be a raid exclusive pokemon we don't know what that is yet though so this will be like the shanks or the clink clink was the gen five one i think it'll be the scatter bug no way they put it no they would not put bug in there that's out that's a 7k egg if i ever heard one it's a one-star raid uh-huh it's gen 6 i mean they're doing all this trading stuff now like long distance trading something makes me feel like it's going to be scatterbug and then vivion's going to have a whole trade aspect to it yeah i i think there they did another trade thing this past weekend right this it's currently going on now until some until uh third yeah and now instead of it being like five miles it was like 30 miles or something uh 40 kilometers so i don't know put that in miles nobody knows what 4 miles or something but yeah 40 kilometers seems to be about the distance uh that you can trade with someone yeah so i'm assuming they're eventually just gonna pull the trigger on this right and just do trade with anyone well they did mention in that article with the bonuses coming back uh they did mention that there are other bonuses that will be happening during events so trading for longer periods of longer distances will be coming back during events i know what's going into uh braids fur fruit and fur few perfume uh haircuts you have to collect all the haircuts i don't yeah i guess it could be scary you know they're going to do it they did all the different ones for deoxys they're going to make you hunt five star ratings yeah it won't be a one star because it's uh since it doesn't have any evolutions or anything but i really think it's going to be scatterbug i think that i just think that the the the testing of these long distance trading and this one star mystery egg during kayla's release and vivion being what it is just means i think it would be a if nothing else i think it would be really cool if they did it so so niantic if you're listening and you've already made plans change them and put scatterplot hey you've got you've got about 16 days you can er no not even you got about 10 days or 11 days before this happens um just other possibilities flow baby probably not skidoo pancham esper honage they could do homage i mean they put clink in and click is like very far in the pokedex and clink was like a unova debut right yep okay when looking at the article the the specific article for the kalos region not the main article they actually say about the mysterious raid egg that they're going to be tracking the progress of this egg on our social channels and we might need your help to get it to hatch sooner for fruit it's fur fruit and it's going to be on the haircut uh yeah i don't know scatterbugs just like for a hardcore player scatterbug makes sense and maybe i'm not saying that pokemon go fans aren't hardcore uh because they are in their own way but there's there there are people i would consider so i'm gonna word this carefully i would consider people who watch pokemon streams every day on twitch which is a small amount of people i would i would say they're pretty hardcore to the fact that they're literally watching pokemon content every day and so many of them don't know how vivian worked um and i i dedicated like two weeks to you know getting all the vivions through gts trading in pokemon home and the amount of times just it was kind of shocking how people just didn't know like vivion had 20 forms and like two forms were exclusive and you could only get forms by doing this and you can't breed it and stuff so if if it is vivian and niantic's already bad at communicating like i think it i think it's cool like it is it is obviously the the uh not the original but it is a pokemon no it is like the original region exclusive pokemon like it is exclusive to specific regions of a 3ds not exclusive to like whether your ds was a japanese game or a korean game or whatnot so if they if so i guess the balance is like we're four years into the game we're about to get eventually viviane but niantic has been doing testing for long distance trading but they've clearly wanted to protect region exclusive pokemon so are they protecting region exclusive pokemon or are they just giving up at this point and just doing trading well yeah but we're also seeing it with the lake trio already being yeah but the difference between vivian and lake trio's lake trios existed for like a year and a half and you know that they're not turning them shiny because people are going to freak out that they can finally get as elf and ooxy and mesprit and then in like six more months they'll be like we're doing it again but this time it's shiny because we want to double dip right right it's just to me vivian is too new for them to do that but the recent trades that they keep doing makes it seem like maybe they don't care as much anymore yeah it's like they're putting klefki in france so like they're still like i don't i don't know what they do they care do they not care i don't know yeah you're right i mean like maybe i mean again the trading is only 40 kilometers right it's not like it's worldwide trading so 24 miles that's what i'm i'm not worried about it but i'm just thinking there's no actual technical limitation of 40 miles to unlimited they could just flip a switch no no but i'm saying like they can still care about regionals because like unless you've still traveled to that place like it's not like i can go trade someone in france right now for a klefki or when it comes out like it's still only 40 kilometers right so someone still has to have traveled there that is within 40 kilometers of me so i mean maybe maybe they hold off um on that but i don't know i mean i guess it also does say it's some mysterious pokemon uh scatterbug is not the most i mean they use this real loser i mean they're real loose with their definitions let's be real right uh yeah i don't know i mean there's a lot of theories out there it could be something that's not even kalos you know it could be something from an earlier gen but well let's let's move this conversation into seasons which i feel like no one is talking about because they did it in the game for one game and then promptly dumped it what no that literally has nothing to do with black and white i mean yeah sure black and white had seasons but like it in a in a game that takes place in real life that kind of had seasons before this like is it this actually makes sense that they're cementing it because they would be like well you can only get well i see feel all the time but i'm more like a wintery buy or a water icy biome but it would but this to me is exciting because it just makes more sense i guess to be like okay we're seeing wintry pokemon okay now we're seeing spring now we're seeing summer now we're seeing fall i think so i guess that's true i just thought that the weather system worked pretty well in how it what it did well they're not getting rid of the weather it'll still work with no i just don't know what they are improving with seasons that wasn't already done in weather right i think that what they're doing what i don't know are you going to you want to explain the article steve yeah so ideally what's happening is there's going to be two hemispheres a spoiler irl there i don't know if anyone taught you that um so seasons will be spoiler three months long because they're 12 months in a year um and different pokemon will appear in different seasons so for example the first season will start on december 1st and we'll go december january february and ideally those would be more uh well this is what they say here they say for example in the first season pokemon appearing in winter will be in the northern hemisphere while burmese dharamaka and other pokemon in the summer will be more in the southern hemisphere and i think what they can do and obviously they mentioned deerling because there's four forms of deerling per season and i think what they can do and what works in pokemon go in my opinion is that they can cut down there's there's 600 pokemon right and technically all of those pokemon can spawn with the exception of the pokemon they specifically turn off which as far as i know like yeah mask is turned off and like deliberate is turned off right yeah but like what about gen four and five uh like second level evolutions okay well they didn't turn those on yet but even if we oh god okay even if we don't count those even if you look at the first three which i'm pretty sure like sceptile can technically spawn in the wild even though i've never seen one yeah i got uh the other day i incense spawned an aggron oh that's a really cool thing yeah so you have you have all of these pokemon that exist and they technically all are spawning but the chance of you seeing like an agron is almost feels like almost impossible so with seasons they can be like well we have 200 pokemon were spawning in this season instead of 600 pokemon or even less they could maybe even say 100 or 150 and now instead of maybe getting like like if you open up your pokemon go right now it's probably like rattata zubat pidgey and purloin or something and it's like all garbage pokemon that you don't really care about i mean i don't know that season's changing that there's an event right now so but if if they could set it where like hey this month you're getting patrat next season you're only getting rattata the season after that you're only getting b-doof right they can at least cut down on the trash to be like well i'm only seeing this trash route one pokemon this for the next three months instead of rattata b doof patrat i think you're being uh really optimistic about what they're gonna cut out and what they're going to include i have a feeling all the trash is sticking around i don't think no matter what season it is i think that i think they fall into classifications and i think if they want i don't i mean there might be a small chance where like rattata isn't completely cut out but i've i i feel like if they're doing seasons they're just going to straight up cut pokemon because they've already done this with like yeah mask and deli bird and i mean i think they're going to cut pokemon but i don't think that they're going to cut the trash no i'm just saying gonna be around forever there's so much trash already in pokemon that they're just cutting the trash into four different segments like think of how much garbage like how many root one bug pokemon you see how many root one cat pokemon do you see how many route one rodent pokemon do you see there's just so much what's what season is rat it doesn't like that that that's the irrelevant part right like you can make patrat spawn literally in every season so just pick one to play yeah well i don't think they're gonna i don't think they're gonna pick one i think they're going to limit the ones that match seasons and still keep the trash i mean just based on what they're saying in the article it seems like that but i mean because like they're examples while burme and daramaka which don't appear already very much would only appear more in summer i i don't have a strong sense that they're gonna be like well b doof is a spring and rattata's a summer like i think those things are just the baseline this trash is always going to be getting that we've literally seen rattata for four years like that that is that is that is what they're fixing though that is why i don't think that's what they're fixing but they're they've already started doing that now right because they already talked about they how they've changed they've changed um spawns here and there and i mean i don't know that they would so you think they're just gonna like literally take like let's say it's a 600 pokemon you think they're going to take 150 of each and just throw them all into a specific season yes and then i will never like i will never see a rattata in fall if it's a spring pokemon yes i 100 believe that i don't think that's gonna happen i don't think this because you have to think about people who are you have to think about people who are new to the game as well okay trading and if okay wait you want delhi bird you gotta wait an entire year to get it or you trade it they've already but that's one that's one special pokemon that they made special when they released it to the for the first time yeah and they made pokemon like dratini special and marie special but now it's not special anymore but it and it doesn't even feel special when they bring it back because you just get the hardcore people complaining oh i see you stratini this event where are the bagons like there there is no winning to when a new player comes in and if a new player comes in and they're like oh man rat rattata isn't spawning for six months you can either be like here let me trade you a rat rachata and eradicate okay cool that was a hundred stardust all right you happy okay move on if they really wanted to you're the so not only could they cut rattata out for like nine months of the year and bring it back for only three months which i think they're going to do uh maybe maybe rattata's not like a good example maybe like because like rattata has like a specific metal to it so like maybe skiddy is a better example because kitty is trash well i mean i love skinny but it's like a trash spawn i mean skinny's already a rare spot this kitty is not a rare spawn i see i see like four skitties a day i see none really i don't see skitty ever i see skinny non-stop i would love to see so i mean this is because the question of what are they fixing with seasons that they don't already fix with weather and biome what do they what do they fix with seasons that they're not fixing with weather bio cutting pokemon that's literally what it does but i don't but based on based on the article literally saying in the first season you're going to see pokemon related to winter in the northern hemisphere and related to summer in the southern hemisphere literally saying that those pokemon are already related to winter and summer and so those pokemon you're mentioning aren't related to winter and summer they're not related to season at all yeah they're not related to a season whereas they're pointing out not every pokemon like like they're still going to be like exceptions to that like like that you like even in the games even if you were to go to black and white and it's like the winter season you're still going to see like abra or whatever in the grass like i wouldn't say abra is a winter pokemon but hey it just spawns like winter summer and fall and it doesn't spawn in spring like i guess my point is that i don't think that like if rattata is deemed a springtime pokemon that there is a zero percent chance i will see it in the fall okay so maybe it's not gonna spawn nearly as much but i do think that like they're still gonna have no other pokemon because they can fix this easily right so if look here here's an example and again this is this is some speculation if if they get if they say like okay skinny is only skinny is only spawning in the winter seasons per loin is only spawning in the um spring seasons we'll just do those for two for example because they're both bad cat pokemon that doesn't mean that there can't be an event in the springtime event that isn't like the delightful cat egg event where skitty purloin and litten are more are spawning in eggs right so they can cut pokemon from seasons but then they can force bring them back in advance so what they're doing that what they would be doing with this base work is cutting specific pokemon so you can be like man rattata only spawns in the in the winter season but hey there's a berry and squirrel event happening and squabbit rattata and uh amungus are now spawning in in march and they can bring pokemon back through events they've already technically have been doing this for the last year of forcing pokemon spawns to feel special the only thing they're on the only thing seasons are really doing is setting a precedent of you now accepting that pokemon are gone and once you once people accept pokemon are gone then they feel more obligated to play during the months they come back because they're introducing another level of uh fomo i mean i i agree with that part i just don't think that's going to apply to pidgey rattata i don't think they're getting rid of those base base first routes throughout that if they don't get rid of those first rounds i just don't feel like see then then there are seasons because there's just there's just so many pokemon now that they need to like separate them yeah i don't know and i guess that i mean i agree that they should i don't think they will like i don't think they're going to take away rattata pidgey spawns zubat spawns ever like i don't think those are ever going away i don't think they're gonna say we're limiting these incredibly trashy normal types to spring only no they are just going to always be the baseline and the things that have strong rarity are things that people are looking for are the things that people will feel like they're missing out on and will want to come back for i don't think that applies to the to the route one trashes i think those are going to be stuck forever no matter what you do if they were to like say caterpie's not spawning until spring and then somebody who who like they they're like missing a shiny caterpie and then spring comes around and they're like caterpie's back did you you missed them here he is people would be like oh man caterpie's back and now like that's the shiny i want like i i i think there's something okay i to bring it back to sword and shield literally everyone including myself we did the same dumb thing in the isle of armor we were like oh my gosh look at a poly toad and then you're like whoa wow look at uh uh a cramer ant and you're like oh wait no kramaran's not new but like you have that thing of being like oh look at all these pokemon that are returning and then you do the same thing for the crown tundra where you're like driving through and you're like whoa look at uh uh let's jinx oh wait hold on that's a jinx but you're like i mean you have that like i don't think that that is universal but you have that like second of excitement because as the pokemon company has proven for some reason we get really nostalgic about pokemon they take away from us and then they bring it back i think seasons are going to be a bit more extreme in removing pokemon than i feel like you guys are giving credit for i i have not seen any hint of that from what they put out did you read the rest of the article regarding that season of celebration research situation i think i just closed it it looks like there's going to be so starting on december 1st at 8 am and the first season will begin the season of celebration pokemon originally discovered in the kalos region will be appearing in pokemon go to celebrate their arrival professor willow is embarking on a quest to research the different regions of the pokemon world during the season so it sounds like during the entire season trainers will be able to participate in a series of in-game events featuring pokemon first discovered in different regions whether you're a fan of kanto johto hoen sinnoh unova or kalos pokemon originally discovered in each of these regions will be appearing as professor willow looks to discover and celebrate their rich histories yeah that's like the same as they've done for like unova like they did that for unova they did that for sinnoh they did that for hohen where they but they did them like immediately right it sounds like it's gonna like happen throughout the three months so i'm just going back to your like your point of like they can have these events where it's like not everything they can bring back skitty in like uh this is a hoenn specific one even though it's like skitty's a springtime pokemon but like here it is now for a little bit during this season or something like that like i would also probably say like i don't think that just because spheel might be a winter pokemon doesn't mean that's feel is always going to appear the same three months like i feel like like it could be possible where like they they just go like well we're gonna do spiel for like like i don't think one pokemon would be specific to a month either they could do like rattata is both spring and summer and now it's gone but that doesn't mean that coming spring and summer of next year it's gonna be rattata again it could just be maybe rattatas for spring next year like i think they can i don't think i don't think anything is set in stone i just think the the exciting thing about seasons is that they're saying like here are x amount of pokemon for three months and we are not afraid to cut the other x amount of pokemon for the time being that's what i that's that's ultimately what i think that would be i mean i would i'm excited to see this for sure i'm excited to see what they end up doing with it what you're saying would be great if they did something like that um will they act on it i will see also uh they talk about like dara mooka darumaka being available in the other houses like summer but like does that mean will galerion darumaka be available in our hemisphere since it's like seems like it's a winter type pokemon like will they will forms be different will they change will they do things like that or i wonder if it'll just be the pokemon species specifically yeah you know like could you know could you have like because they have formed these different like forms and stuff now like could you have like maybe a lowland rattata in the fall and regular rattata in the spring so you're getting a rattata of some kind either whether you're in each hemisphere in there during those seasons because right now i see both all the time right right so yeah they could do a thing where they could do a thing where they and they do on a shorter time span do the whole like well they did at one point i'm not sure how much it still works this way but the whole night and day thing right like you're much more likely to see uh an alolan rattata at night or like a hound hour at night because it's dark type and all that stuff like they were doing for a while or they would have like pokemon that were more apparent tonight than daytime um so they've done these kinds of things in the past um on a much shorter uh time line okay level 50. this is what everyone seems to be talking about but for the first time since the game's launch leveling up and go will be rebalanced there are many features and changes made to the games over the years we are revisiting them to make leveling more fun trainers who have reached level 40 will soon have the opportunity to level up to 50 being one of the first uh bragging rights as a level 50 trainer if you're up for the challenge for players who haven't reached level 40 you'll find leveling up is easier than before for various adjustments of ways you can earn xp and then what they're doing is they worded this very specifically if you're a legacy 40 trainer not a legacy trainer there are plenty of people who started the game on what what day did it launch like december july 7th or something july 6th is my start date yeah july 6th i believe i believe you can have the fifth if you're like in australia or something but i think july 6th is like the first day yeah july 6th for me too but if you're a legacy 40 trainer so if you hit if you are level 40 by december 31st at at midnight you will earn an exclusive gyarados hat and a special legacy 40 medal to help trainers get to 40 faster double catch xp will be live until the rest of the year um if you didn't get that memo um additionally trainers will be able to power up uh pokemon higher than a level before and there's a bunch of stuff here australia already has this australia's niantic's guinea pig i guess yeah but uh like one of the examples for i think level 41 was and these could change i guess because technically it's not rolled out was you had to catch like 200 pokemon in a single day plus have a certain amount of xp plus um do like two other things yeah they've kind of listed out sort of what each of the levels is yeah i mean i know australia has like the actual tasks but i have uh 46 right here in front of me which is complete 100 field research tasks take a snapshot of a pokemon seven days in a row make 50 excellent throws and then hatch 30 eggs plus you need the minimum xp that they want from you which here it says 15 million xp which that doesn't make sense to me because you need 20 million xp to be level 40. 15 million xp on top of whatever level 40. so like level 41 shows you it's like level 41 shows you it's uh you have so much out of that plus like 6 million like i think it's a level 41 it's 6 million more xp than whatever you have i see okay that makes sense i was like what are they lowering the xp why is it 15 million it's 20 million to get to level 40. that's like a kind of a weird way to communicate it yeah it's i think it like looks kind of weird the way that they have it set up as well but i don't know if that means so wait does that mean let's say you have what is it so it's 20 million to level 40 right yep so if you have and let's say it's it says like 6 million xp to get to 41 let's say you have 30 million xp total does that mean you've already cleared the six million or do you need to get six million more from the moment that this opens up so i i got a response from niantic from this your xp rolls over so if you have if you have 40 000 xp for sorry 40 million xp you would be clear to at least get to 46 because 46 you just need a bonus 15 million so that would be 35 i think okay i'm reading that right yeah anyways your xp rolls over so you're if you have 60 million xp you're you're good for the first couple levels you just have to do the task your tasks do not roll over so if you've completed uh like two mil if you completed two 2 000 field research and you get to level 46 once you get to 46 you have to then complete another 100 field tasks same for like with team go rocket i think it's like level 45 you need to do like battle 100 team go rocket grunts if you already battled 300 that doesn't count you have to once you get there you have to battle another 100 to complete that task so the only thing rolling over is your your xp levels okay and that makes sense that makes sense why the tasks are added because you know you've got your people out there with hundreds of millions of xp and so yeah um but you get nothing for being level 50. uh i mean i think you get like avatar items but um there's there's no gameplay changes here so for example once you hit level 40 um you can power your pokemon up to level 50 without you being 50 and you can power up your pokemon past level 40 sorry from 40 250 by using the new xl candy uh and there's multiple ways to earn excel candy you can earn it by trading you can earn it from hatching pokemon i believe you can earn it from raids but you use the xl candy to power a pokemon from level 40 to level 50 but you yourself don't have to be 50. nothing changes for you as a player character if you were 42 or if you were 48 nothing matters it's just literally bragging rights so except that the real real game begins yeah except right correct my gosh the real real game begins i mean i'm still not even level 40. and i'm not going to get to level 40 before december 31st you don't think so what level level are you greg i'm 38 and three quarters oh you could get there before december 31st don't you want the gyarados hat how am i going to do this before in a month they've doubled the xp catching for the rest of the year it's it's four million to get there and one one catch is like 200x well if you're enough of a sucker greg you'll do 50 he-tran raids with remote raid passes and not get the shiny i am not that much of a sucker uh you're getting double hearts right now when you open a gift yeah and you could open 45 gifts a day yeah that would require my buddy to bring me gifts yeah no you can open them have people send you gifts and then open 45 and that's two hearts a day and then just just pop a little egg two hearts for what oh like friendship friendship hearts because you need you need seven hearts for great friends and then 30 hearts for ultra friends and then what 90 days of hearts for best friends though yeah yeah not gonna happen hey look i'm trying to set you up for success [Laughter] i mean you all can send me stuff i mean i'll open your gifts but since my buddy is absolutely refusing to bring me gifts back this is not going to be a mutual street and tell you that much i think the overall challenge of getting the level 50 i think it's cool i think i think maybe some people might get frustrated like they can't do it very quickly um but obviously it's not designed to do quickly and also it doesn't matter i'm sure there's going to be like it's like it's like that one person you meet at the like at the grocery store you're like waiting in line they're like wearing like a tank top and they're like kind of like looking at their muscles until you look over to them and then they're like hey man just to let you know i do crossfit and you're like yeah i don't need to know that but that's like literally every pokemon go player and go they're like oh are you playing pokemon go and you're like yeah they're like i'm level 40 and you're like geez i didn't i didn't even ask like why are you telling me like i don't care like that's it's like they're the same person as what i'm saying like none of this actually matters but you better believe as soon as i get 50 i'm letting you guys know every single podcast oh i know i i text with you on a continual basis you're the worst i'm excited though i think the challenge thing is is fun yeah i think i agree i think that people have been wanting this since the beginning or right or since like people they hit level 40 and for you know because we're human everybody needs like what they consider like an end goal for a game right they can't just like be okay with what it is and so this is a nice this is another nice uh goal for people to hit um that it again doesn't mean anything but it's a nice something to uh progress did we miss anything is that is that everything excel what go beyond his dumb oh the name yep uh yeah there's the 12 days of friendship event yeah that's going on now that's not yeah but that's not really any yeah yep i was gonna say it's not sorry i skipped this from the callow stuff it's not that exciting to me for the callow stuff because like chespin fennekin froakie bunnelby fletchling lit leo are gonna appear in the wild if you're in france you get klefki but bundle b is the garbage rap pokemon we just spent 20 minutes talking about it is the new rattata it is the new patrat so you'll be able to find what do you think 50 candy to evolve it so what is that like you get six so you need like 10 of them yeah you can find 10 of them probably within four minutes and now cool you you did it you did not have bundle b and you now have diggers be in like 10 minutes then that leaves like fletchling and lit leo which might be like slightly harder on the fletch things like the garbage pidgey although fletching is like significantly better than pidgey in like every yeah way in pretty much every way fletching will be like the 125 candy to get the talonflame yeah yeah yeah because you need 25 and then you need what a hundred yeah but like that wasn't hard with pduv and unpheasant like they were everywhere um and then lit leo is whatever so that just leaves like froakie fennekin and chespin and i this is like the new not new it's just like the thing that in pokemon go where you go why would i bother hunting for these because they're going to be the hardest ones out of the six pokemon to find even if i found like five in a day and i get to break breaks in braxton i'm going to have to spend so much time and effort to get to del fox but also i get punished for evolving to del fox because i didn't wait for community and also why why would i spend the time looking for these i guess to maybe like brag that i have them or maybe maybe one of them or two of them are really good for pvp and i need that for pvp why don't i just wait for community day where they have the best move and i don't have to do any work and they just come to me in my house with an incense well this goes this comes back to i mean right because we're already caught up right we're already caught up to calo so i mean the uh one thing they could do is just the community never involves the starters for gen 6 like they just cut that off and they don't do or they do it way later um but i mean it goes back to just like you know if you like collecting pokemon then you might hunt them and want to collect them i mean you can wait too but i mean i do miss the days of i guess this was like gen 2 when like they just dropped all of them yeah right like that was amazing that was so cool to just i mean they had the babies and the eggs but to walk out one day and it was just all of these pokemon there were so many new pokemon i mean i know there was only 100 total in gen 2 but uh that was amazing and i feel like they never really got back to that because they need to they want to like dribble a bit you know like yeah they want to do the the trip feed but yeah i guess my point is that i just really miss like the just dropping an entire generation and you know if they could come up with like a different way to keep people they have so many ways to keep people interested in the game at this point right they have raids and they have pvp and they have like trading they're opening up long distance trading and it almost seems like with so many different things to do like you could really drop more than just seven and not have to worry about people being really bored in a couple months you know like come time for like a lola in a year like it'd be great if they just dropped the whole generation for gen 7 at once because there are so many other things to keep people interested that even if i do get them all in the first couple months they're out there's still a lot you can do and not feel like oh i'm bored because there's not a new pokemon to catch i don't think i've evolved oshawott ted pig or snivy yet because like i have really good ones like i have a hundred iv tepig and i just like niantic has just taught me that i get punished for not waiting for the specific day to evolve it yeah because we can't tm them during the community today it's like exactly i there are some pokemon who i mean even more rare poke like i have a hundred percent uh iv gibble and i'm just like well like i feel like there will be eventually be even though it's shining again there'll be a kibble community today so i'm just not gonna evolve it until then right like i remember at the second ever go fest there was uh a hundred iv mudkip and there was like some guy who might keep 100 i'm right here 100 iv mod cap and like all these people came running over and i caught it i was like oh cool 100 iv mudkip sweet and then you know i evolved it to marshtop uh swampert and then the community happened and i don't have hydrocannon on it i mean but is hydra cannon really that worth it like what are you using like swampert is like super good in pvp because of hydrocannon but are you pvp no because i don't have hydrocannon i don't think that's the thing that's holding you back it is i mean i just literally i just literally used an elite tm on a swampert to turn it to hydrocannon to trade to somebody for a lucky trade because they wanted it so bad with hydrocannon now that's why his money spent i didn't spend i mean the elite tm came from whatever one of the i didn't spend money on an elite tm come on i'm not that much of a sucker remote raids incubated yeah they haven't got me there they've got me here but um it's fine it's whatever uh and then i think they're rolling out did they mention this in the press release i know we know this because it's already live in australia but there's platinum medals now so instead of gold medals um you can now earn platinum medals like i think for example one of the platinum metals and again i don't think it's final because it's not rolled out but technically in testing in australia i think one of them is uh the pikachu so pikachu is like catch three pikachu for bronze catch 50 pikachu for um silver catch 300 pikachu for gold and then i think it's catch a thousand pikachu for platinum yeesh they mention the platinum metals because you have to it says you have to get a certain number of platinum metals before getting to 43. yeah i think it's like but that's there was just that one mention of it and then before they dropped the test in australia people were like wait a second what's a platinum metal like like okay wow a thousand pikachu huh is what the yeah i'm up to 800. yeah what am i at for pikachu i'm at oh i'm at 1482. all right well bobby's not allowed on the show anymore [Laughter] where do you see this you have to go you have to click your face and then you have to just uh scroll down uh under your gym badges to the metals and then tap the pikachu one got a pikachu in the middle pikachu fan yep yep i have 205 pikachus well you're uh not that platinum one yet i guess nope nor do i care you don't and know what you're missing at level 40. do you know what i'm missing it is absolutely nothing you have you have attempted to show me your great skills and i'm like and and you have no follow-up wait look at and you're in tears that you can't experience the amazing gameplay i'm gonna be i'm gonna be i'm gonna be having so much fun at 50 and you're gonna be like man i wish i could have this much fun in life please tell me when that happened when you were level 40 for three years please please point to the time and date and photographic evidence of me being upset at you being 40 in the last three years look i haven't we're not allowed no longer to develop the pictures yet but there are there are countless pictures of smiles on my face for being level 40. but yeah that doesn't that you faking smiles for a camera isn't the question it's it's you showing me in tears because i'm not experiencing this glorious world that you pretend exists we're not allowed to uh let people actually know how glorious it is when you hit level 40 you sign an nda with the pokemon company and uh you're not allowed to let people under level 40. look this is the internet i know where reddit is i know who breaks nda i have done the research it doesn't exist greg give us our question of the week question of the week let's hear that question of the week i know you aren't because you're focusing on what what your world's gonna be like at level 50 and it's nothing this is from franco for in our slack community for for somebody who's uh new to pokemon and wants to experience every region what is the correct combination of games to play in what order let's go heart goal sold server omega ruby alpha sapphire the remakes of sinnoh next year [Laughter] uh black and white black and white to xy sun and moon shield gosh okay well you're wrong no one should ever play sun and moon play ultra sun ultra moon oh sun and moon has the better story sun has the longer story it's the better story yeah it's it's it's definitely better that's like saying like you know you want to you want to remember it's like saying the real game starts at 40. it's like saying like you want to read like dr seuss's green eggs and ham or do you want to read dr seuss's like go dog go like like sure classic one is like slightly better than the other but i don't think like it's because you don't like story because you're a game gobbler no i do right well i think that you never read it i've seen you skip like a million times what are you doing you have you have had to ask me on multiple occasions on multiple games what happened okay in the story final fantasy is the worst at telling a story because they're like they'll do they'll do like they'll do like three lines of voice acting and they'll read it as slow as possible and then by the time like the story starts to get good then then they like cut the voice acting and then you have to read it yourself they give you reading at the bottom you can click and skip over the voice acting you don't have to wait you can just read but again you are opposed to reading story i have read every line of dialogue on my stream recorded for every pokemon game yeah because you have to now i don't have to but look there's only so much i can be called big d before i'm like come on dude well don't pick big d well it was either that or a little p i mean little p is more accurate wait why big d look you play x and y no what's the d though for d for oh bobby well i don't think we're allowed to answer that question on this podcast unfortunately jesus as it turns out d is for dog bobby jeez get your mind out of the gutter big dog um what was the question oh this is a hard question to answer because like you have to buy hardware and games to go yeah you do uh if you have a switch i think getting both let's go and sword and shield is good yeah uh if you have a 3ds i think x and y omega ruby and ultra ultrasound ultramoon are the way to go i don't think you go older than that though honestly like if you're really hardcore i guess you go back to black and white is what i would suggest yeah i mean but it does say every region you said every region though yeah so you have to go back because they haven't been remade i think that you have to go through the struggle that we went through no i don't know that's how you are so bad when you play them again you're like this is this is torture this is actual torture but i appreciate that no it doesn't it makes you hate them because you can you've experienced how good life can be and then you're like you know what i love having shoes and comfortable padding but instead i'm gonna walk on nails i couldn't go back to shoot my shoes but i'm just gonna walk on nails for for 20 hours 20 hours so that i appreciate my shoes more and everybody's like you know you don't have to walk on nails there's literally an older pair of shoes they remade that path with better shoes like nah nails only if hey i'm just saying if you don't have a switch and you want to play kanto you could either try to find leaf green or fire red for whatever can you even play that on 3ds no i can't even play it on 3ds right on the old um so you gotta go virtual console yeah i don't have to you don't do it it's better than an ideal situation if somebody had access to games and consoles and i guess never somebody who is new to pokemon wants to experience every region see that's like and it has all those consoles and games but never experienced that we are making a bet on like where like what is going to be entertaining enough for them to go through i would this is what i would say i would say you start with omega ruby alpha sapphire then you go greatest games then you go to x and y because i think x of y is a step up in in like discoverability and like variety is a step down in gameplay what x and y is so much worse than omega ruby alpha you know what in like what in every way i don't think so wow i don't think i don't know if i agree with that because because uh not every way because like literally figuratively i don't know whatever to use both words please uh omega ruby apple sapphire has hms and while x and y does have a gravity fair lets you fly on a latias around the world on a jet pokemon and has every legendary and all the megas including new ones and it's a great story x and y is weirdly paced and hasn't uh things happen oh they both have flaws but i think the the the i think we're awesome they all have flaws they the thing that x and y has going for it is it begins the removing of hm's which which for whatever reason omega ruby's alpha sapphire went 800 steps back on and they're just like hey look to the point where they're like rock rock smash isn't even an hm and they require you to have it to get through one route over and over again even after you rock smashed it it's so frustrating and there's no character customization because they went back on that because they're like hey this kid called brendan with a dumb hat you gotta be him and you're not allowed to do that is amazing and he has an incredible story like x and y is so good at making the character feel like you and giving you a huge variety of pokemon to catch early on which i think is a huge huge huge plus for anyone getting into pokemon whereas like if even though i think let's go is a good game what is your what is your route one experience rattata and pidgey cool but you are new to this you have to learn the basics that's why you don't get overwhelmed you learn with the garbage basics of omega ruby alpha sapphire which is limited pokemon on the the beginning routes no character customization and suffer through hms because this is the last game where you'll actually have to suffer through hms before you get to x and y where they hugely scale back on hm's they give you a huge variety of pokemon you can be yourself as a trainer then you move to ultrasound ultramoon get to experience all that again then you move to sword and shield and then if you were to make it through those four games then i would say your heart that that you're clearly desperate and dying for more pokemon content then i would say you go to black and white that would be my order okay so and just never seen four yeah where are you putting almia and ori because those are still two regions and the question does say every region oh my gosh where are you getting ore and which one are you doing for uh almia you finally the only answer is scales of darkness you find a trash can and or a grimer and then you throw those games into that no because those are good games which of the ranger game ranger spoke about ranger shadows follow me as a good game uh i never played it but i'll take your word for it also then we would have to also do the region of foray which is the first ranger game so you have to play both rangers you have to play gales of darkness and all the main games to experience every region that pokemon has to offer okay so and if you really want to jump into one more you hit up tumble cube island and play pokemon quest because it's wonderful yeah disrespect everything and just play quest [Laughter] is tumble cube island a region i don't know i guess it could technically probably be somewhere in kanto that was just never discovered i mean male 10's encanto was never discovered that's true that garbage pokemon oh yeah because there's no question of the week i'll bless you guys with an email sent in this is from taylor one of the week because whale's out because we just did questions oh sorry yeah no no pokemon of the week because what's up that's what i said uh this is from taylor from west des moines iowa listening to this week's podcast
