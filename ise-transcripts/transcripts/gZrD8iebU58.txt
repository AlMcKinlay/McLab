[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 459th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is will i what was i gonna say i i never found that piece of equipment that i was looking for so i'm lost you go go on without me you never found your your ethernet dongle correct what do you even need it for you to improve the the did you not know that if you get your internet like with the wire touching it goes better you get more you get more internet than if you do it wireless you put you get the more more internet goes through wire then goes through that wire yes that is how the image is this is why my desktop that i record on is a wire and not through the non-wire look i hey update from last week still haven't screwed my desk together it's been a week i know where the screwdriver is i mean how are you using it is it's just leaning on itself and you hope it doesn't follow i mean it's it's it's deep it's very holding itself together uh greg is here i am here i am wearing my d20 socks and i'm ready to go all right well we have to get going because we got a long possibly long enough if i say it's long that means maybe how is it going to be long because sometimes it's longer than the really short game you want to talk about what are you talking about i am just overwhelmed with all this 25th anniversary news yeah we got so much 25th anniversary news we might even not have time to talk about pokemon snap i'm just kidding there's no there's no 25th well there was there was some news but well whatever what's the sub news get it out of the way there is a meow event yeah which you were all salty about i wasn't salty you jumped early i just got in and next thing i know you're up playing snap and then i go to my first den you don't even wait you just like well it's done i didn't know you were doing the done what i was in your chat you're like let's switch over so i switched over when i say let's switch over it's it's me saying i'm switching over and understanding that twitch chat is doing nothing but what they were doing oh so you're just lumping me in when i said let's switch over i didn't know you were actively switching over yeah well i switched over and now i have three shiny gold cats let's okay play the news music we're here there people actually knew the name of that file their minds would be blown because i have it and i know what it's called um make them a ringtone because of golden week sword and shield had a shiny gallerian meowth event this weekend and what's golden week golden week is where something happens in persona 5 and then monster hunter comes out and then no one goes to work and then they all celebrate i believe this is the worst explanation i have ever heard golden week is the week where if you are a fan of japanese animation also known as anime uh there will be no episodes that's also true oh wait really that's true as well one hundred percent you i was shocked that there was a new episode of my hero this week because they got that they have that in the hopper they just have to press the button go i was told you never traveled to japan during the golden week because you'll never get anything you won't be able to see much wow everyone's like because all the japanese folks are traveling they're all crowded so what can you actually give an actual definition of what golden week is no i don't know no you even know i just i just gave it no you didn't you said it's golden and people don't do things yeah go there okay fill in the blank golden week is the collection of pokemon no will i uh i have no idea i didn't have any national holidays within seven days four four in combination with well-placed weekends the golden week becomes one of the of japan's three busiest holiday seasons besides new year's and the obon week ooh i don't know what obon is but that sounds cool yeah it does to be fair the pokemon company doesn't get to pick when golden week is so to be like shiny meals to celebrate golden week to be fair they knew when this was years in advance true it's like saying oh i didn't know that the 25th of december was christmas who knew is it on the 25th of every year so they decided to do shiny gulerian meowth and then gigantomax mouth and then regular meowth and then alolan meowth for golden week in pokemon sword and shield which is the problem we keep having time and time and time again where they like to have a million events and also release a brand new game at least with pokemon go they were like shiny smeargle you get 15 pictures a day it's not that time consuming you can't keep like there's a threshold once you get to 15 you're kind of done you can't get like a sword and shield you can just keep playing until you get it and sometimes that could be several hours i mean and the pokemon go one was tied to pokemon snap i mean the reason that we're having the pokemon go event is to celebrate the release of pokemon the new pokemon snap i think again the problem here is like they always do thursday to friday sunday but they could have pushed it up a little earlier i don't get why they just didn't like hey started on tuesday give us like a little head start because with pokemon snap i knew sorry with pokemon go i knew pokemon snap was coming out and i normally when a new pokemon game comes out i do long hours on twitch which is me being like i'm i need to hit a pokestop and i need to catch a pokemon and i need to do my dailies before i sit down to stream because i'm going till midnight but the little quest line they did came out on thursday right yeah thursday they'll like take a snapshot of a ground pokemon use seven berries like i did that on thursday when i was running my errands and also sick and then when friday came i was the quest line was done no no you finished the quest line yeah those of us who have not even started it it was not done it's not done and it won't get done to take a picture of is it the first tab or is that the yeah today today tab i think it ends tonight let's talk about pokemon what there's no other news there's got to be something buddy look it is the 25th anniversary i mean there isn't even there's like one thing to cover for masters and there's one thing to cover for go we're gonna just jump into the main event do you not know how to tease people yeah sometimes i make them listen i don't know if they made it this part of the episode they're still listening i they added ryhan to pokemon snap they did my pokemon fight me and pokemon i mean he made photobomb in go you don't know or snap maybe there there was a japanese survey that went out that like ranked all the pokemon masters sought after characters but i wanna i wanna i really do wanna talk about that because even if you don't like pokemon masters it's a very interesting like you won't believe who came in third place but we'll save that for next week because like because we got pokemon snap and i i don't want to do that in disservice because i think that survey was really interesting and fun um well you're gonna have to send it to me again because i'll close that tab and not look at it spoiler milo didn't make top 15. that's right don't even don't even so mad so the actual shocking news of the 25th anniversary is that greg bought pokemon snap i did i poke him on snap that that is the that is the show for one reason and one reason only because you had to let a mouse out what that's that's all i saw pikachu nah i don't think it was an electric mouse i mean literally what i saw was yes i have to go release a mouse i'm buying pokemon snap this is the message i said and i will tell you how those two things are related so i was watching as i as i had said i would watch the stream and see if pokemon snap looked fun i also watched steve's stream it looked fun enough steve bragging about his pictures getting sweet medals two sweets was more than enough to maybe like that uh what was it the the meganium was it meganium got like 65 suites not just two yeah but him talking about that and being like i'm gonna do this spurred the competition in me and like oh i'm gonna show this dude for sure but i had no plans to leave the house but our live mouse trap suddenly had a mouse in it which meant i had to go take it to its new relocation center somewhere out in the wilderness which meant i had to leave the home is that because you had your life pokemon tricks in the basement and then the mouse figured out the tricks was down there because you were trying you didn't get the box on amazon i'm confused by the phrase live mouse trap what would be the alternative a kill mouse trap oh i prefer that yeah no we don't do that so it came to the point where i was sitting here and i could hear that there was something in the mousetrap and i'm like well i have to leave wait actual real talk yeah is the live one more expensive than the kill one no i mean they're more expensive in that you make the purchase of the trap once but they're reusable so it's like the one that snaps not reusable no because it tends to get pretty stinky full of mouse smell and all the mice are like oh that's where my stock so we're gonna avoid it i guess that makes sense uh and some of them break uh so and plus look the mouse didn't know it was breaking into my house per se i don't whatever so you saved a mouse though you're here i saved a mouse and i had to go release it into the wild which is really basically saying i kill the mouse through natural means because the bird's gonna eat it but i had to leave the house we didn't take it to the mouse sanctuary there's no mouth sanctuary but i did this wait i have just visualized greg the great i want to say humanitarian but that doesn't apply to mice so mouseketeer greg the great mouseketeer is like disney's gonna sue us now a live mousetrap so that there is no mouse death in my house and i am going to take you precious life that i have now saved to the local snake pit and dump you in i mean there are there aren't snakes in the park that i know of i took it to the park there are a lot more birds in the park and we do have a lot of owls so look after i'm done at night mouse you're on your own but because the mouse because i had to get into the car and drive to release that mouse i was like well i might as well go to target and pick up snap so i did this is how i ended up buying pokemon snap because i caught a mouse right now i now understand your your reasoning is similar to what i would use if the mouse had not been caught i would not think this is really weird okay hold on [Music] gosh there's so there's so much so for for the sake of this pokemon snap conversation there is a story to pokemon snap we won't be talking about the story one because i didn't finish the story two because i'm sure some of you guys didn't finish the story three because some there might be debate whether you would even classify it as a story um and uh if you're i feel like for the sake of the conversation i i have not unlocked all 200 some pokemon we do know there's 200 some pokemon because that's what they said in an interview but i feel like all pokemon are fair game except maybe we won't spoil the bosses besides meganium everyone knows meganium is the first like okay so you're calling that the bus sure yeah how are their bosses in a take pictures game well i can i i guess you haven't gotten to the ganium boss right i i've literally played one minute's worth of pokemon showed up at the front door and then we'll we'll ignore legendaries because i know there are legendaries in the game so we'll ignore this but if it's if it's a basic pokemon dex filler if you can put it from your hand out on the bench without evolving it it's fair game so with that being said for those that didn't know pokemon snap is was made by bandai namco namco bandai whichever order you want to pick they were the people who made pokken official order yeah there i think it's namco bandai i think it's just namco bandai yes uh they were the people who made pokken tournament and pokken tournament dx they also worked with creatures to make shadow mewtwo shadow mewtwo according to their website it's bandai namco so they they made this came out for weeks on this show myself and i would probably say greg we're like i don't think this is gonna be a sixty dollar game and i still think that really no no you don't think it should be asic we we have no it is a sixty dollar game i know it's a sixty dollar game so the i i'm about 20 hours into pokemon snap right now and prior to this conversation i i thought that i would be coming into this week's podcast being like well uh six hours later i beat pokemon snap but i'm 20 hours in um about halfway through the pokedex i have one million photo score what's your max photo score you can get no one million is like all your photos combined into the overall score because then there's the leaderboard of like it's kind of how you can tell how far somebody is you'd be like oh that person has half a million so they're probably like right before the volcano level or this person has like two million so they're like probably close to everything unlocked and ready to go so i'm 20 hours in i have a one million photo score and i'm very glad that earlier this week i played through the original pokemon snap which to be fair i played a lot as a kid so i'm pretty familiar with where the pokemon were there's 63 pokemon in that game there was supposed to be 64 pokemon in the game atkins didn't work he they had to cut him last minute so 63 and i was able to play through all of the first pokemon snap and pretty much 100 the game get all 63 pokemon in about four hours and i suppose maybe if you've never played the new the original pokemon snap maybe it would take like seven or eight hours there's maybe five i mean like i don't know i feel like if you get stumped somewhere you look up a guide as a kid i didn't have an internet and my parents wouldn't buy me a guidebook so it was a lot of like figuring out where that last pokemon was but there's a there's a pretty stark difference between the games i'm curious though at what point greg decided that it was worth buying because i think you were in stream for maybe like three or four hours but was there like a certain point where you were like i told you when you posted your picture we're getting sweet medals oh the competitive thing the competitive aspect i was like i'm gonna you know shove this into this dude's face yeah i am so big i would say right i very similarly happy birthday tan growth yep right there it's like that was it i am the bow tie in the confetti and i was like i gotta get this game uh actually the the fact that it was not just not just like take the pictures out and post them on twitter and whatever but there was like an internal see how your friends are doing see how your friend's shots are that tipped me into the okay i'm more interested in this game uh and then the mouse tipped me over into finally buying it uh but it was the fact that there was a built in internal i can see how my friends are progressing also that they did something very clever with how they post pictures like there's a lot of thought put into the online component which is a rarity for a nintendo game um and that that pushed me into okay there's enough here that i could find enjoyment i still i still have a number of complaints about the game but overall uh that was sort of like okay i can this it looks pretty which is always a big thing yeah the graphics are real nice uh and there's an online component so you can see how my friends are doing and i can see the shots that they're taking and there are enough pokemon that i like that i've seen so far that i would like to take pictures of them there there is some some ones that i have not found and i don't think i will found and i'm mad about it i mean you'll find them eventually you just keep trying yeah i keep still trying well how's your first level experience no no i have not gotten a first level i've played one minutes work at the front door i found out that i am in the lentil region there's a person named rita there who i didn't see in your stream at all so rita must go someplace else at some point pops in and out uh they introduce more characters which i don't know if that benefits the game but they exist i um i yeah so i customized did my character customization yeah uh oh i'm glad you brought that up i mean it's not that big of a deal and i was like in the in the trailers they were like here here's your standard white boy here's your white girl and i know that's important to people of color to have not white and they never showed that in any of the trailers but they but i was like well they did poke and tournament you could be black in pokemon tournament or you can um you know have a little color to your skin but there are so many like little things that i saw right away from playing pokken tournament that they just brought over copy and pasted over which is like a good good copy page am i getting hats and scarves is this what you're telling me no that would have been really great yeah there's no like fully like you pick your what your character looks like and that's kind of it no no hats or scarfs although that would have been cool yeah so i know we're in the lentil region and the island we're on where professor mirror secretly mirror bee big disappointment on my uh that they chose that but whatever uh those cameras have mirrors is yes but hi fyi in the original pokemon snap the professor was professor oak yeah that dude doesn't know how to grade a photo to save his life it doesn't matter i can argue that the current dude doesn't know how to degrade a photo either could we not have had the current a current pokemon professor why did we have to create a new pokemon professor and then do historic revision of nobody's ever done this kind of a thing before well i'm sorry 21 years ago professor oak was out on this mission and oh wait no this hundred-year-old explorer in this book i i think it oh yeah captain vince i think you thought i'd play this game for one minute and it's already got me aggregated i think he's talking about not not the i think he's like no one's ever taken photos before pokemon i think he's saying no one has ever like figured out what is causing the illuminati no no no no no there was no mention they literally were just like nobody has done this kind of exploration before period yeah because okay so within an hour of the game todd shows up from the first one and so this is why rita doesn't come like rita is less used because todd who is all grown up they aged him like i don't know i don't know how old he was supposed to be in the first one but he's he's clearly an adult and he comes and then he is like wow you're a great photographer professor is doing a great job so it's they're they're not there's i'm i'm almost positive they're referring to the illuminati thing because he because todd also seems confused about the illuminati thing but they talk about how like oh todd did this and he took photos and he has a mentor for our listeners who actually read and or listen um it's illumina it's not illuminati it's not illuminati illuminati the secret society do exist so that that was that was a pretty big surprise that todd is there i don't think they i don't think that's how is that a surprise at all it's as big as the surprises everybody's making it out to me i never expected the character that appeared in the other version of this here's like here's a major character from the first game there was one character from the first game that wasn't professor oak who was also in the anime who would have guessed that he was in like three episodes at the end no no no no but if they had put tracy in this game yeah that would have that would have been like why are you pictured dude pokemon legends there is there's like a phenomenon right where people remember movies that don't exist isn't there like some shazam phenomenon where people remember that being wrong most famous is the berenstain bears oh yeah that's one of them but uh no uh it's the mandela effect because the nelson mandela one is the most famous one i don't know what that is nelson mandela dove you don't know what the effect is the recording now you know who nelson mandela is i do okay i don't know we have to move on the point we're gonna i'm gonna text irene right now the point is that i i they're constantly over the weekend people were confusing maybe it's just my twitch audience uh sorry twitch tracy sketchit and todd snap like there was like a memory blur where people were like oh yeah these are actually two different characters and i had to be like no tracy is not a photographer he is it's tracy sketch it he draws and then todd is well todd was in pokemon snap which you all remember but he wasn't he was only in like three episodes the anime he but yeah there was i people were like oh yeah they were totally two different characters although maybe they had like similar energy i mean they did they were both artistic i can explain to you 100 what it is it's folks who don't know who don't use adobe products don't understand the difference between illustrator and photoshop and to them it's like they both make pictures that's true so what is the difference between that i know the difference between illustrator photoshop uh one does ray tracing and the other does uh something with the pixels point point point vector no photo illustrator does vector yeah there you go doesn't matter they both do pictures they might as well be the same person uh i think todd being there is good i don't have any problems with professor mir uh rita is like a very cute character um she comes and goes but they do this this is the worst part of the game we're just gonna get the worst part of the game out of the way they introduced this beyblade character named billy or johnny or what what is his name greg charles bill phil is it's your is it your rival yeah they they introduce a rival and they do it really cleverly they like they have the rival come up he's like let it rip and he is very excited to like combat you in photography and then and then todd and then he yells at you he's like no todd's my mentor stop talking to todd and then todd's like you have to give your photo badge back because you're not a real photographer yet so like he he comes off very strong he's like let it rip wait phil has to give his photo badge back no phil has failed us back so that's like the most clean that's like the most clever part is like phil's very he he's like aggressively excited to combat you in photography he doesn't want you talking to todd because todd's his mentor and then he's like a fake photographer because he's just borrowing the photography medal that you get after like taking three pictures in the world and then mirrors like here's your photography medal um and then the entire rest of the game this dude is so obnoxiously annoying and useless that you're just like why are you here do you know do you know why he's obnoxious and useless he like lysander y comes you have mid mission and he's like i gotta take a picture of that's that executor and you're like get out of here man i'm trying to this is why you don't have the medal go out and take some photos buddy wait wait so you mean so he he phone calls you like todd in a previous pokemon yeah yeah just to tell you know that his rattata isn't the top percentage of what does see because todd is his mentor it's just the wrong todd correct yes yeah there are two there are two tops so he got confused because he thought phone caller todd was photographer todd and that's why he keeps calling you at the most inappropriate moments to tell you about things when you don't want to hear them but also he hates you because the minute he ran on screen and i was watching your stream you said oh here's a dude with beyblade hair and i don't know what your obsession with beyblade is that you accuse all these people of having they played hair i don't even know if you know what that is it's because you know i'm not sure what beyblade is at this point but i remember there was a beyblade i was a remember i remember there was a beyblade anime and yes and i feel like the characters in beyblade had a very distinct hairstyle and art style and so when babe when beyblade phil comes up and he's like let it rip like he just he oozes the beyblade persona big beyblade baby big baby the bbe i remember his name his name's cameron he is the spoiler for black and white he is the dude that beats ash he has five pokemon in the elite in the in the victory road or whatever and ash had six because because cameron is running bbe and he he has so much bbe he's like i forgot that i'm supposed to bring six pokemon and i only brought five and ash is like oh sucks to be you i brought six and then ash still loses to cameron uh but cameron was was let it rip as well cameron was very let it rip look there's a couple beyblade characters that exist in the pokemon world it's fine phil though is the worst part of the game he's awful i every time he talks i want to just like why are you here he's there for like a hot second but you don't even have the option at the beginning of the game to have the characters not speak yes or speak in japanese i think the problem i have with phil is so far after 20 hours phil has done nothing except that's why he got his thing revoked and sec and he he just takes away time from rita who rita like she's just excited she's ready to go she's like give me your photos no no no conflict is what drives drama it drives plot like phil's conflict is like i stubbed my toe and i you need you to hear about it it's like it's that's why you see this is this is this is the old saying you hate in others what you hate in yourself maybe i am the phil maybe you are the beyblade i was gonna say have you ever judged let it rip all the time that's part of it but it's like i've been the beyblade you've been for the place do you know what they say is if you can't find the bbe in the room you are the bbb in the room yes but very true have you never had a friendship where it's like it's a friend but yeah absolutely no i've never had a friendship whatever where you don't like really like the person so your option is to either ignore them but if you ignore them then they're not going to think that you're friends and that's going to cause a whole kind of other issue drama so what you do is you constantly call them with like very insignificant meaningless boring things so eventually they don't want to be your friend anymore and they go away on their own you drive them away phil phil drives people away it is the ultimate goal of pokemon snap to bring phil in to love your inner fill yes to let your inner fill rip we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll actually talk about the photography part of pokemon [Music] so we will be right back what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a mix of a porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales jackalope probably a horse and hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales jackalopes probably a horse yeah but then like what is but then what are like what is it but then what is nidoran supposed to be a porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a mouse whale jackalope probably a horse an hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs a mouse whale jackalope probably a horse in the amsterdam [Music] we are back from our break more pokemon snap we have to this is the question people want to know the question people want to know is should i go out and pay 60 for this video game and that was probably i said this earlier in the show our biggest hesitation going into this because i still don't think that back in 2000 2001 when whenever pokemon snap came out as much as i loved that game as a kid one i was a dumb kid i didn't understand money but two as like an adult you guys were both adults when that game came out yep and i still bought it back then and i was still mad about the price like pokemon snap was not worth 50. it was 50 because nintendo 64 games were 50. or were they 40. i think it was 40 i think i got it i think i got it on sale for 39.99 i think it was like list price was 49.99 well i think you could buy it there was a ten dollars off whatever yeah there were some 64 games that were yeah yeah i think the 60 games were like donkey kong because it came with the expansion [Laughter] pokemon snap and we we spent a whole episode about this was like a perfect go to blockbuster on friday rent it for 3.99 and then a month later be like i'm in the mood for pokemon snap and do it again that there's no way that game was worth the 40 it was unless you were that is yeah basically what i did except uh potomac video not blockbuster i will say this i bought it originally and then i bought it again on virtual console but at virtual console for the what was that virtual console 10 15 bucks yeah it feels like a yeah better price it was a better price it was like uh fine i'll buy it again it's fun enough and pokemons the new pokemon snap is fun enough it pushes me to the is this really worth the amount of money that i paid for it limit like i don't regret buying it and i i don't i am having fun with it i need to i need to put closer on some of these things uh but i think i think that asking price is a real stretch i think you are unless you get really into the gameplay and really like oh i'm in the grinding of it because there is a lot of grinding to be done um then you'll never blink about you'll never think twice about the price um and it's so i'm going to say this like your experience is very different than my experience because i'm gonna say you have a bunch of people watching and interacting with you and that helps distract from the grind quality of it so saturday morning as i'm grinding through the same levels over and over and over again to try to get this one research picture or this one thing that i need to get that perfect ducklet that began to really wear on on my enjoyment of the game uh without sort of having like i'm not going to have a new picture to post online or i'm not going to get something that i want to put up for people to interact with having to redo the levels even though they change enough every time that it feels a little bit different i'm still feeling i began to really feel the grind saturday morning and to be honest i haven't gone back and played yet uh there i i can definitely see where it coming from because day two i felt like i played for five hours and i got i didn't make progress yeah like like i made progress in like okay that picture's slightly better that picture is like slightly better but you hit a it it's like um gosh what kind of game is it where like it's it's really good it's almost like it's almost like completing a pokedex yeah when when you first start the game you're like this is new this is new this is new this is new and then you get to like 200 of 300 and you're just like oh okay well i guess like like it feels like it took me five hours to get these 200 and now it's gonna take me 20 hours to get these last 100 because that's where the that's where the grind actually is like the one percent pokemon and stuff um so i definitely see where you're coming from i think though like i am so glad i was wrong leading up to this point because i just didn't think that this game was going to be like i like i i argue i'm already arguing in my head whether this is one of the best pokemon spin-off games ever um because like it's though conquest is good you you originally thought it was going to be like a four hour game and you have now played this game for like 20 hours yeah yeah and i'm like not even i i'm i don't even think i'm halfway through and i don't think i play i don't [Music] uh i will say like i'm at the point where i'm beginning to struggle with wanting to can you continue with the game it's good that new areas are opening up and i can do new things and that helps that helps reset the grind when a new area opens up and you get that first initial flush of seeing all sorts of new great things and you can kind of get excited about it again but i do agree with some of the reviews that the game is fun but then the grind sets in and you either will find the grind enjoyable or it will just be you know the peliper around your neck but that's the fundamental rule of grind yeah right if it's the game that you love right then you love the grind right it's the same with monster hunter right if i have to kill the monster that i love 30 times i it doesn't matter monster hunter i love it and i will go i will do it 40 times and and like that's just like if the grind is in the game that you love right then you love it if not then it's just grind and it's work and it's like why am i doing this yeah but like i just in watching steve stream the game which is really what pushed me to get it i was like i really like these graphics i think it's a lot of fun how you can interact with the pokemon with you know even though it is limited interaction um and i just you know i kind of like just enjoy the concept as as a fun i have paid 60 dollars for games and played them for less amount of time yeah right so i think if you okay so this is another question i got like i can get my pros and cons at some point if you want like there's things that i love about other things that i currently hate about it yeah there's only like two actual gameplay things i don't love and and i don't like phil but otherwise gosh i'm so positive on this game uh but the the thing i will say like if you didn't like the first pokemon snap i don't you're not gonna like this one yeah i don't think this game is gonna convince you anyway if you didn't play the first pokemon snap that's like a harder question to answer because pokemon snap is pretty unique in what it does but i would say it's probably closer to like a shooter like you point and shoot and you take photos um and even if you're you would be bad at shooters and you're on on rails so it's um like you're not moving again some people have never played it so maybe they maybe they're watching and they're like are you moving the game moves for you uh that is hard for me to say you should go out and get it unless you're just a huge pokemon fan i think if you're a huge pokemon fan and you're on the fence i would tell you to pull the trigger um because i think the moments in the game are still super worth it uh there's just so many interactions between pokemon and maybe like maybe the better argument is like oh well what pokemon do you like because they're in the game like i knew my i knew irene loved score bunny so when she sat down and played it oh i i do have another bad thing the tutorial in this game is bad it's bad uh it's bad i haven't gotten that far it might be worse than sun and moon's tutorial i'm not saying a lot i don't know have you have you re-watched diamond and pearl's tutorial that's like four hours long uh it's so it's not super long it just it feels so basic that it feels long like they explain things in a start stop method like did you get that point and it's like okay yeah i got it feels it doesn't feel the information they're conveying in the tutorial feels fine but it just feels so slow yeah it feels like they they go and stop they go and stop and keep in mind it's an all ages game right they probably should have at some point given you an option of do you need a lot of explanation or a little explanation and then for younger folks that they're going to need a lot of explanation but i don't think the game the game has a good pacing in the fact that like when you go out on your first mission i don't know what they call it photo photography mission you only have your camera yeah you drive at any point and you shoot and then like the second time you go you get your scanner and then the third time you go you get your apples or whatever i'm not even there maybe it's like fruit yeah um when do i get my illumina orbs and so i i felt like the tutorial was you have like a 12 week program and that you're like the tutorial felt like two whole lessons of the 12 weeks and you're like we could have just done this in like one lesson why are we stretching out why this is taking so long let me just get through it it's not the end of the world obviously you go through the tutorial and then you got 19 hours more of gameplay to do in the tutorials maybe at most like five minutes seven minutes or something it feels long um but going back to irene i knew she liked the first pokemon snap she didn't play the first time she played it was like three years ago so pretty recently she thought it was really cute she was really bad at it because she's bad at pointing and aiming on video games like doesn't have those she's not you know she's not like a halo pro very bad at shooting um but i gave her my game so no tutorial i didn't tell her about the apples i didn't tell her about the scan i didn't tell her about the illuminati balls i was like here this is the trigger you pull this is the a button you press to shoot it's just like a apex legends you know point at something take a picture but for me it was like i am going to give you the levels of pokemon you like so here's the first level with score bunny because she loves score bunny and then i was like here is the level with marine because she loves marine and both of those levels like threw her over the moon she was just so excited and it was also really interesting to see her because she always struggles to say like which pokemon she likes and doesn't like so it was really cool to like see her reaction of like pokemon that i feel like she doesn't think about all the time like she freaked out when she saw beware and i feel like she's never brought up beware in a conversation before but that was like really cute to see so i would say like maybe if you're on the fence you're a huge pokemon fan you didn't play pokemon snap you're on the fence i would maybe even look at the roster of pokemon because like seeing your favorite pokemon doing something like they they do things in this game they just don't stand there like like in store and shield they're just walking around and that's fine and that's cool but like their interactions between other pokemon right uh the music the the apples the scanny thing it's just so charming well that's one thing i was going to say is if you've ever in your life said i wish i could see pokemon going around in the world yeah this is the game for that yes this is the whole the entirety of the game is the pokemon are in the world that's probably my number one positive of the game the levels look beautiful the interactions that they have in the game are super fun super cool the things that they do and interact they're i i don't want to say that they're surprising because if you think about it's like oh yeah that's what that pokemon is and that's what that pokemon would do but i think it's like weirdly affirming because you're seeing things that you'd only necessarily imagined uh actually happening and that that part of the game is super fun and exciting and the levels change so as you do more things and more pokemon come in or out or you've altered how things work a little bit the interactions change so there is some level of newness every time you go in uh that diminishes over time like this i would say like the second time when you get to level two of a route and there's a whole bunch of changes it's as exciting as the first time you're in there but then when you're grinding through level two to try to get to level three to get the next thing the game really drags ah yeah um there's again it felt like when i was unlocking research levels i was unlocking them after two runs and last night i was like i just we did this volcano four times in a row and why why is it why did it slow down like it almost like it artificially slows down because it knows your it it knows you're grinding it over and over again it's very weird very weird like it's like i took 70 photos and you're only giving me it's 8 000 experience where in like this course i took 70 and you're giving me 50 000 it's like why is why did this suddenly change from today to yesterday that part seems weird so i mean the thing that i think is frustrating is you're only getting experience for the ones that you show and if they make a big enough difference so if you have a worse picture of a cachnia and it doesn't unlock a research test none of my cactions are bad pictures yeah they are i've saw them but if you'd like have a great picture if like you got lucky and took a perfect picture of cacne you're never gonna get better and you're never going to get experience for the subsequent ones after and that slows down the game because unless you're specifically trying to take a picture of a cac need to fulfill a research task and we'll talk about the research tasks i'm assuming um then it's like okay well i'm i've already got four perfect picture pictures of a cacnia this section of this path is useless to me or this i'm just going to sit here until i get past it that's so it's not useless just sit back and enjoy the view i think i i think i wouldn't say it's useless i would say that at a certain point when you're going back through routes you have to pick and choose you do so if if like where the cacnia is there's also heliolisk and um i think like manda buzz there's a couple others so you're you're pretty much at that point being like like i'm to the point in the game where if i'm going through park i'm like these like i know that there's these pokemon at the beginning these pokemon in the middle these pokemon at the end and i my my beginning is going to be focused on pichu my middle is going to be focused on ducklit and then my end is going to be focused on like sylveon and you have to start making those choices because it's not it's not because like you already have the pictures of everything else you probably do you probably have the torterras and the hoot hoots and the the swanos the the reason you have to make those choices is because you have to get a better shot and if you and you only have uh moments to get that shot so you kind of have to ignore everything else and i don't think that's a bad part of the game that's something you kind of had to do in the first pokemon snap where like all right this run i'm going to only focus on sand slash for this run i'm going to get the magikarp that monkey's going to hit the magikarp guard is going to come out i'm only focused on gyarados uh so i don't think that's bad but you your runs start getting very focused and that's when the grind comes out uh which is i mean you're trying to top high scores so like there's no i mean if you're playing mario you're playing pac-man playing frogger you're optimizing the best routes because you want to beat that score so you do have to you could play this game i guess two ways or both ways you play the game where you're like i don't care about getting the highest rankings i just want one photo of every pokemon and technically there's four photos of every pokemon which we haven't talked about and you could probably get a photo of not even every pokemon you don't need every pokemon to you know complete the story and see the credits and for people that i saw s speed run the game within the first weekend then by speed run i mean they try to get the credits as fast as possible joe from cereby said that he got credits for the first time in 12 hours and he was playing you know as fast as possible so he could get stuff on the site there was a youtuber that got beat the entire game in eight hours because they just wanted to see how fast they could get credits um a lot of reviewers from whether that's like ign or comicbook.com or game spot not to be confused with gamestop they said that most of their credits came at about 20 hours i'm 20 hours and i haven't seen credits so if you don't care about the high score right and somebody says hey this for me personally if somebody says hey for 60 bucks you're getting a 20 hour game i think that's worth it i think that is a lot of content like i played uncharted one two three i played the last of us i don't know why i just named a bunch of naughty dog games but all of those games were 60 and i all of those games i would say were about 15 hours long and i 100 thought that like my 15 hours and the last of us or my 15 hours in uncharted 4 was super worth it um but if you want a hundred percent the game you do have to accept that you're going to do the levels over and over and the levels are the loop i think the loop is good but your uh serentona serotonin hit is like way better earlier on versus the uh the end where you're just like well i'm gonna spend three minutes just focusing on deflate i'd go with dopamine over cereal yeah okay there you go a dopamine hit is is better uh yeah i would agree with that um you know you're you're worth wildness out of time like i wouldn't a as an epic rpg player 15 hours is is a short amount of time because i expect long stories from my games granted this is a different game um but like it's it's a similar style like i don't like first person shooters but i loved bioshock bioshock was well worth my money because the story was incredible and it was a fairly long game this sits very much on the fence for me um i would agree with like if you're a big fan of pokemon and you've never played snap before or if you're just a big fan of pokemon you will find a lot of worth in this game um my complaints are i do have complaints but my complaints are relatively few compared to the fun that i've gotten out of the first levels and the and and that sort of initial rush of all of the routes that i've unlocked so far um that's super fun i think the online interaction is super fun being able to post things and see people's stuff all of those things push me more that i feel like i got my money's worth out of this game your mileage may vary um but i think if you're on the fence but you're leaning yes or you're on the fence i would say you will get a solid 20 hours credits are no of fun out of this game before you really hit any sort of grindiness or where the grind becomes unbearable yeah i don't think i got it i didn't start i guess hardcore repeating levels until about maybe 12 hours in but i haven't i also haven't unlocked everything yeah i haven't either and they do this interesting thing so in the first pokemon snap you would take a picture of a vulpix and then oak would come up and he would be like you were close or he would be like wonderful and then that was it right you you and then he remembered it and there were 63 pokemon and then you had an album where you could hold like 40 photos and that was it so you can do 40 favorites no matter what and then the best ones from oak and the best one was always going to be mu because mu was always worth the most points so once you took a picture of mu it would surpass everything else uh and then that and then in this game they do this actually really clever thing and this was one of the things i was worried about is like how do you how do you expand on the first pokemon snap it's a pretty basic game it's like you take the picture it's good or bad you move on if it's if it's if it's good like at a certain point earlier this week when i played pokemon snap i got the best dragonite picture they're like at by best i mean the best score you could possibly get on dragons four stars yeah it was it was 4 200 points and i looked it up online because there's fan-made online leaderboards of like and it's all dominated by incredible japanese players of like here's how they and then they it's it's cool it's like a fan-made site but it shows uh pokemon snap all the high scores and then some of them have pictures so you could be like wow how did you get your dratini picture that high and then you click on it and you see there's two dratini and you're like whoa i didn't even know i could get you two dratini in original pokemon snap but then you see where they did it and you're like oh i want to reproduce that so in the old pokemon snap like when i got the best dragonite picture i've had zero reason to ever focus or look at dr like i literally couldn't get a better picture of dragonite um that oak would would say and the entire time they announced this game i was like how are they going to expand on that because at a certain point like once you get a picture of vulpix what are you going to do you can but they do this thing where they have it's kind of confusing though and i kind of don't like how they did it but it's one two three and four stars but the stars the four star isn't better than the one star oh yeah they're different poses different poses and then in the stars you can get bronze silver gold and then i think the last one's either platinum or diamond it's diamond i believe so you so you have a way to so every pokemon you need four pictures of so the star thing's a little confusing because when people are watching they're like oh four star must be the best and it's like no it's just not composed it's a different pose so that's a i don't know how else you like yeah so there is like one star is them just existing two stars them existing plus three stars them existing plus doing like an attack and four star is is them doing something out of the ordinary or surprising and you have to catch one of each that brings me to one of my complaints is you can only select one picture out of the folder so if you got a one star a three star and a four star you can't pick one out of the one one out of three oh i swear before you have to just pick one which forces you to go back to recapture a picture of a one side that you already did and i i find that somewhat frustrating because i'm like i have one for each category of this pokemon just let me select them because they all go into a different spot why am i only allowed to pick one picture that that is that is that is when the game showed to me the grind and that's that was like my first like oh come on i have different categories of this pokemon like i i i didn't consider that but i can see that as a complaint that that is one of my complaints is i want to be able to submit multiple photos of a pokemon that i caught in different poses at the same time instead of having to go back and do that again i would say maybe to play devil's advocate the the okay thing that comes from that is like when i went through the the the reef level i think it is where squirtle and sharpito were there um that was like the first time i saw squirtle and sharpito's actually in quote too many levels but i i took a picture of the squirtle and then um when i was done it's that was the first pictures of squirtle it said one star and it was just like squirtle um standing there and then it three star was squirtle like getting eaten by sharpedo and my three star was really bad it was awful but the cool thing was like i know that that's how i get three star now so like that was like the good thing that i saw from it pokemon violence but that does a lot in this game that doesn't stop you from making the choice to go back and take a better three star like yeah that's true it takes that choice away from you i just knew that like this picture is bad and i'm going to do the level anyways but now i know how to get the three stars so that's the positive i saw from it but i see the point you're making so i mean that's that i think that's probably my biggest knock against the game is like you can only look at one picture of one pokemon from each folder like you you fly through rating them at the speed of light thankfully after you do your anime glasses evil glasses uh pose uh i i do find that to me was like don't don't show me the grind let me like grade it so that i know that that was a good idea but you've been playing video games for 50 some years it's very easy for you to discover where the grind is and like you know what i mean like yeah i mean i'm i've been already certain for the first five or six years video games did not exist no i got pong in what 76 no again there are again i said it's a minor complaint but it is a is a point when the game shows its grind it's a point when you're like why are you making me choose i think the i think the other i like gosh this is not a complaint it might seem like it though i have not looked anything up for this game and thankfully my twitch community is very awesome and they're very nice and they understand that i don't want to be told how to get something done so i would say this is something we haven't talked about yet pokemon snap is a puzzle game yeah and there are things that you have to do to line up and some of them kind of can be difficult because they don't exactly explain what you need to do in order to get a good picture like i have probably taken 500 pictures of buffaland because i love buffalo and i got a lot of buffalo butt pictures i got the one star the two star and the three star and i have them all in diamond or platinum or whatever like the best pictures you can get for them i have not figured out how to get whatever the four star they want from boofland and i'm sure i just could look it up i'm sure somebody figured out i'm sure within the first hour of the game somebody figured it out so like the grind for me wasn't necessarily what greg said the grind for me was like restarting that buffalo level time and time again and like playing the music and throwing the apples and throwing the illuminati and being like i don't know what needs to trigger this i don't know what it is and i might no i might be in the wrong area maybe he only does the four star during the day and i'm doing it at night and i'll never get it um and i believe in you but but i i like the i like that puzzle instance but at a certain point like the game doesn't give you any feedback of like what you are doing right or wrong right um and it's just a lot of trial and error like when you see a hair cross and you throw an apple and he doesn't do anything and you're like throwing an illuminati naughty ball and he doesn't do anything and you probably saw you throw like 30 apples at a poor sneezing turloin yeah get bogged mean yeah i bonked the heck out of that for a long time but i think about that was the same thing like i threw a bunch of apples that didn't do anything i played the music you didn't wake up like i threw the illuminati orb it just kept sleeping and that cause that's that that i can see be frustrating of like i don't know what i'm supposed to do here uh and the game doesn't give you any fee and like feedback maybe at a certain point mir or rita will step in and they'll suggest something i i haven't really paid so i have noticed that some of the potential four stars are hinted to in the requests that they make so there's that list of like hey get a picture of this um and some of my four stars that i have managed to get were because i was trying to get the picture that they were asking for um so there's a little hint but not a lot uh because there's a lot of requests up there that's a secondary complaint that i have um that request board is like overwhelming sometimes the request is overwhelming you in order to get credit for it like you can't have just taken the picture you have to show the pictures to the professor sometimes so you'll get a choice of do i fulfill the request or do i get the better photo and i don't even know if i'm fulfilling the request uh so there's there are some things that i like for as much as the game explains to at the beginning i kind of wish they explained other things more because you are sort of in the puzzle dark wondering i don't why did i get research credit for that i took the picture oh but i didn't show it to the professor so therefore i don't get credit for it even though it's in my folders i sh why are you not giving it so in those ways i'm like this is a little bit of a frustrating experience because i'm forced to make weird choices for different reasons in the game uh and i i struggle with that a little bit i mean it's good that like the research stuff does give rewards and it gives me rewards that i want which is usually unlocking stickers and things to alter my photos with so i kind of want to do those things um but i had to also because i was getting frustrated when i was playing on saturday to be like i just need to get through levels to unlock things so i see new pokemon i got to stop focusing on this because i'm getting frustrated with the lack of guidance i'm getting frustrated with having to redo levels and not understanding where this event is supposed to happen so i'm going to move on um are these the research tasks that you were talking about before okay yeah they show up so on like your main screen you have like three buttons on the left and then you have um like it's i think it's the y button in the upper right and it will say research tests and when you first start the game and you like drop that down there's like 20 of them it's like take a picture of a blossom take a picture of a the torterra find a square bunny uh get different vivi like there's a bunch yeah but you don't like you there's not a huge incentive to do them unless you just like to unlock like badges or like icons like they don't really do anything specific specifically more stickers to add to your photos they give you like stickers or frames or which i like titles because i need my online approval of my instagram account you need your what sweet but sweet awards what are they called sweet but then when you first connect to online this is this is the problem i have with it i don't have a problem with them telling me like hey take a picture of modern vivian when you connect online all of a sudden that starts filling up with like online stuff oh dlc no it's just like yeah so and so snap the new photo check it out and it's like no i don't get out of here i don't want to see that like if i want to check it out i'll go to the online one i'll i'll look at it all at the same time the online though is is better than expected it is uh they have put me over the edge to buy the game they have um actually you know what we'll we'll take a break and then we'll talk about the online stuff okay because i think that if you're slightly competitive or you have friends who are also playing the game i think that that social link makes the game very cool yeah i agree [Music] oh [Music] and we are back from our break before we talk about online stuff uh we re launched the patreon it's all did up uh so very exciting we've had the patreon for almost six years which is mind-blowing to me and over the six years i've like slightly tweaked and changed the rewards and took away things that worked and added things that i thought would work um but i overhauled all the rewards um and acted like we're launching a patreon for the very first time and i think the rewards are really great so um it starts at five dollars and five dollars will get you uh ad free version of the podcast it will get you access to slack it will get you two bonus podcast episodes a month which is probably the biggest thing that people want usually that the complaint is i wish your shows were longer or i wish you did more shows so this is your way of getting more shows um and then right now we're running a special offer so anyone who signs up for the patreon at five dollars a month will get nick is doing uh taking six of the newer break musics and he's making a little ep for them that you'll be able to digitally download um if you sign up for the patreon and that'll be done probably before the end of the month and then you'll just be able to download it and if you back the kickstarter stuff that's more music you can add to the collection but i know the break music goes over really well so we want to do that seasonally so this will be like the spring technically it's not summer yet so this would be like the spring season um for that so anyone who signs up at the 5 we'll get the album the uh 10 is really great so we have a 5 a 10 a 25 a 50 and 100 and that all comes with support and everything so if you're interested in that patreon.com pcamencast uh or just ise.cash that works too but if you have any questions or you've never signed up for patreon or you're very curious uh feel free to let me know you can message me on discord or twitter or instagram i guess you can dm me there if you want to but yeah yeah instagram all the time all the time instagram is where it's at yeah it's a hot happening instagram even though it's technically just facebook messenger but we'll pretend it's not it's not it's very different but i'm super excited that we relaunched it again if you have any questions feel free to reach out um best time to sign up is the beginning of the month because patreon always charges at the first of the month so like if you sign up for patreon on like the 29th then you'll get charged in the 29th and then you get charged in the first so this is the best time to sign up um and if you don't like it if you decide that you're not using the premium feed you don't like the bonus episodes any of that stuff you just cancel any time it's pretty easy you could literally even ask for a refund if you get five dollars and you didn't feel like it was worth like you can just get your five bucks back uh it's totally cool also we're doing a brand new thing uh right now it's gonna be like the 25 tier just because we need to limit people and i don't know how much of a disaster it will be but we'll be doing um like a live group podcast so the 25 dollars gets you into that um because people want to be on the show um and some people want to give input to the show but without using a microphone so obviously you'll be able uh discord has like a new sound stage feature so people it's almost like clubhouse or um facebook rooms i think that's called it's like this new type of audio but if you want to be a part of that we'll pick a topic every month it'll be you come in uh you can either opt to raise your head it's almost like a call-in show opt to raise your hand and then we answer the call and then you either ask a question or you give your feedback and that'll be a cool thing we're trying so we're trying that this month um that's going to be for the 25 tier and if it works we'll keep doing it if it doesn't work i will completely scrap that and move on to different content but i know people want you know their voices heard they want to be part of the show so that'll be um that'll be something we're trying this month i'm really excited to try it out and get to hang out with you guys and talk to you guys because i talk a lot on the show and i'm sure you guys shake your hand and yell at your car stereo as you drive down the highway about how i what they actually do is they write to me and greg on instagram to complain about you yeah they do and then we're like totally here's the link to the lawsuit you know sometimes people write in and they they they yell at me that you guys are too gay and i don't know if they think because like like like i'm going to agree with them uh they have probably emailed you because they approached us first and got an earful so believe me we get plenty of those i don't even know what that means it's it's it's the they're the worst emails and i'm very glad when i tell those people off never to listen to my show again you can't see it on the audience in the audio version greg almost spit out his face uh anyways pokemon snap pokemon section um i found the subsequent roots lacking the leaderboard stuff is better than i thought it was going to be yes absolutely kicking your butt the the initial problem i normally have with leaderboards is it's usually easily gamed at some sys in some ways and then you know the leaderboard is just the same like picture the same whatever a million times and you know it is what it is uh but they have a cool option where you can just switch to friends so i have like 65 friends that bought pokemon snap bunch of suckers uh but i can i can see where they rank and based off the score we talked about earlier i can kind of gauge how much they've played or how far they are in the game um which like now i'm kind of stressed about because i'm not playing today and i was like ranked like 15 out of 65 people and i don't know the day's not over if you don't care about the ranking at all the game lets you upload six photos and these are photos that you can uh put stickers on write a little caption for and you can upload six photos at a time and once it's uploaded you can get two sweets on your photos so somebody can look at your photo and it's just like an instagram like they can hit the little a button to like your photo and then you get little sweet metals and if you get enough sweet metals your photo gets seen by more people which is a better chance it's literally instagram and you get a better chance of getting more sweet likes and it's both it is like the good part of instagram but also the bad part of instagram because you'll put work into a photo and you'll be like wow this is really funny i'm so clever hahaha this is gonna get a million sweets and then it gets like five sweets and you're like what did i do wrong so here's the thing i don't know what that experience is like because all of mine are banging gold well no no no greg it's i i i watched this happen on the stream steve is you know okay do you know that episode of seinfeld where costanza's like i'm going to do absolutely everything the opposite of like i normally do and then i'll be successful and it turned out when he did the opposite of everything he normally did does he was successful this is you steve yeah you literally put up the happy birthday tan growth which was an amazing photo and you said this photo's not going to get any likes this one's dumb look at this other tango and like literally there was another tang growth photo that was awful it was literally terrible and you're like oh that one's so much better than mine and then you put up happy birthday tan growth and it's like it's all the sweet likes um a great photo and it's like you it's you you stand in the way of your own success exactly i put up solid gold every time my my tank growth which is popular amongst my peoples they have reached out to me here comes the emails they have cut they've reached out to me through instagram and other other messages to say how much they've enjoyed it and laughed uh i put it up where about i knew it was i knew it was solid gold to me this is the problem is i'm getting in my own head you you don't know how to run your own sweet gram i i don't the rest of us are like i'm a social media failure i will say so the good thing that they do with the game we want to point this out is for whatever reason they figured out on this online this time if you haven't gotten to the level that the person posted a picture of it doesn't appear to you it's and it will say hey this is going to show you stuff that you haven't discovered yet are you okay with that and why they got it right in this game it's incredible it's incredible it's amazing i'm like this is how how did you know to how how did you get it right you fail at everything else but this one aspect is so good oh because bandai namco right there yeah it's crazy because like okay so for those that don't know what's happening um so there there are 200 some pokemon in the game and some pokemon are limited to specific courses right like like um spoiler charges in the game uh i think that was a given uh they they definitely showed like venusaur and i think they should blast toys in like the trailers but they never showed charizard but come on it's charizard but i didn't get charizard until like 12 hours of playing the game like he's pretty deep in the game and it's not even the first like two times you do the level it's like the third time he appears and you're like whoa charizard's here that's actually it's like it's exciting i think to me it was like exciting to see charizard finally but if somebody went to the volcano level and i'm not there yet well even even if i went to the volcano level and i played through it and they they went to the volcano level and they took a picture of charizard even though i did the volcano level and even though charizard is there but i haven't seen him yet when i go online and i look at like greg's photos it'll have like a big x through it and it'll be grayed out and i don't know which pokemon that is and if i click on it i can say like i'm okay with seeing that pokemon and it's crazy because it's just a charizard right like like it is not anything that you're like oh is it a brand new pokemon is it a legendary did they add like a it is just charizard i or i went to my friend uh catherine and she was like i really want you to check out this photo i think you would love it and i was like oh i haven't gotten there yet i don't know what pokemon it is and i was like you know what like i'm i'm going to do it because i haven't done it yet i want to see what it is and i clicked it and it was fruitish and it was like too frillish holding like little fins and it was very cute and she did like really cute hearts on it and stuff um and it was like how did you nail this so good like you have made me like you're not spoiling a frilish but also like it's kind of like will's complaints about um sword and shield like when you it was like you were kind of scared to do raid battles because you're like oh like you're using a stone journey and i didn't know that was a pokemon yet um and i i was kind of confused on like where you were coming from when you were like that because it's like well if you watch the anime you see pokemon early if you play the trading card game you might see like the game chooses when to show you pokemon but with the raid battle stuff like oh they can just bring eternities in and that might be your first right down there yeah yeah um but the fact that they like like they don't want to show you pokemon like from earlier in the game is just a super nice feature and it's like and then you can also choose for yourself whether you want to spoil it or not i think that the fact that they put that in in that choice seeing that that again seeing that section of the game is what prompted me to go release the mouse and go by the game like that that part made it like okay yeah i'm gonna go buy this game and i'm gonna go do it tonight because i was gonna wait till saturday when i had to run errands but i was like okay i'm gonna go do it tonight because i they did the online stuff so well and it's so nice to be able to sort by my friends and i can look at what the pictures they're taking and i don't have to worry about the general public and their dumb comments or their dumb captions and i can make things for my friends that my friends will get and find funny and they can easily find it it's not hidden it's not in a morass of a million people it is i can sort to my friends and i can find it and that part is so well done that that that literally convinced me to buy the game yeah the the online the the only weird part about the online it's such a minor complaint is that if you wa if you have if you're if you're in the album you can edit a photo and then if you go to upload it it will yell at you that you have too many so you have to back back out go down to the internet go into there then delete it then go back into album to hit the upload that's the only complaint is like those those should be you're limited to six and if you haven't filled up it's kind of a problem so you have to like delete before you plan to upload otherwise it's gonna yell at you um but man like the it's it's such another part of the game that you can completely ignore and still get your value out of but it's part of the reason why i haven't unlocked every level yet i think there's a snow level i haven't unlocked i would be surprised if there wasn't and there's a lot of snow pokemon but yeah it was like you i would i would take i would take a bunch of pictures and then i would be like okay these are going to these are going to go to mirror and he's going to be like hmm wow nice shot wow and then when i when i look through i always want to look through even when i'm done because i was like oh these might make good online things and then it's like oh i think this this photo has too sweet potential but uh so i'm gonna save it and i'm gonna come back to it later and it's it's so good it is uh i want to point out another thing because we touched on it a little bit um the judging criteria in this game is way better than the original snap the fact that that was that was a prediction that has been proven false because steve was like oh you're just going to get the pokemon in the middle of the photo and he's going to say that's wonderful and move on the fact that direction is a category facing or not facing the camera is its own separate category so even if you can only see the back of something you still get a decent you can still get a decent score like that that criteria is one of them but there's a lot of other criteria and that that really made the scoring feel more dynamic to me like you're not just saying it's only i mean granted i agree with some i agree professor mir isn't interested in your art professor mirror likes only what he likes don't get artsy with it get artsy for your friends what was the title of that article it's like pokemon snap does not watch your avant-garde photography i'll find it again cause it made me laugh so hard he um so it makes sense in a lower lower sense like he doesn't he doesn't care about the rule of thirds he wants to be who wants the pokemon in the center of the picture uh he wants the full pokemon and he doesn't want a close-up of justin's face he wants the full pokemon center the picture because he's using it for research research all right here's the title here's the article title that made me laugh new pokemon snap doesn't want your avant-garde photography so it it it makes sense yes that that that happens so they did they they took away some things that oak used to do and then they added some new things so in the original pokemon snap it would be it would be um whether there's a special bonus that would be the number one and that wouldn't always appear but like oak will be like wow well pikachu on a stump that's worth at least 14 000 points or he'll be like whoa a pikachu riding an articuno that's never before seen 500 points he like there's a special category um and this game doesn't have that at uh which is kind of a bummer like there's no like like mirror at never point goes like whoa a murderer of murkrow and that that feels a little sterile in this game where he doesn't like he doesn't ever think anything is like more exciting than other things like it's a man of science he is a scientist do you like the facts about a pikachu on a stump and mir is like oh i just witnessed a graveler fault his demise but like he like doesn't care he's just like cool you did it the world of nature is cruel i said grandma to his death and i know it i didn't mean it come back grappler you like have like five marina eating of course la and mir was like nice shot actually moves on hey that's disturbing but we're gonna just move past this so it is a bit of a bummer that like there's none of that it's like small flavor of like mere reacting to things that seem interesting that oak used to so they got rid of the special and then it's it's like uh oak did size and then oak did like position and then he he he yeah technique they called it and then he added on if there were more than the same pokemon in so if there was two routine or three vulpix he would give you bonus points and then he would have like a times two if it was facing you or in the center or whatever and so they got rid of the times two they adjusted it so instead of like the same pokemon mirror is just like oh there are other pokemon here which is like nice if you took a picture of a cacnia and there's like a skroopy behind it he'll be like oh cool let's see it's a groupie so it does encourage you to get other pokemon in the photo um and then he broke down the what greg said the positioning and then the centering so positioning is wait is it it's positioning and it's centering right the direction direction and position well it's pose uh direction position seven categories yeah anyways one one is like completely center in the photo and then the other is like how straight on it's looking at you which can kind of be confusing because like i got a hundred pose with magikarp being like horizontal like seeing magikarp horizontal like it's not magikarp straight on which some pokemon it is straight on but with magikarp it was like completely horizontal so that can be a little confusing like so with with some pokemon like credidly you're like where is the front of you like your heart yeah well it's like it's symmetrical at the base it's just like his head wobbles around so you're just like where's the exact front of you so that's a little confusing and then size this is maybe the most confusing one size is the entire pokemon in the picture so like it's not how big the pokemon well it is how big the pokemon is but like if you're taking a picture of vivian he wants a hundred he wants to see the entire vivian all the vivillon in there yeah so if viva viviana is super close to you and its wings are cut off that's a smaller size because you're getting less of that vivian yeah so alolan exeggutor is not in this game yeah i mean you know i don't be on the one thing and i haven't found it yet um so yeah that's it it's the grading is better there are still points where you're like yeah i don't know what you're talking about man like i i get it but man this other photo's way better shift your shifter glasses but again he doesn't want ava guard photography he wants clinical scientific by the book photography none of your fanciness and then we can talk about the first like boss battle which is meganium yeah so when you do the park level it's like park during the day then park at night and then i think they want you to do park during the day one more time and then because it's different and then the it's called was it it's called like illuminati zone or something aluminized yeah so that opens up and then that takes you through it's a it's a shorter level i would say most levels are like two minutes long and this level is closer to like maybe a minute and a half and you can replay this level and this level has like a scoring so for example there's another boss later and when you're first doing that level you only see that boss and then when if you upgrade it from level one to level two you will see pokemon off to the sides in the first boss level yeah so you there is a reason i just don't i need to go back to the boss levels yeah i just don't know what spawns around meganium because i only did the meganium one like i do because i've done it twice what spawns around meganium uh evie comes and plays with meganium so evie rides meganium's back and runs around and does a bunch of uh stuff and they interact as friends yeah boy yeah boy but you're just you just like kind of follow me through the level except this time you follow meganium and evie through the level because evie runs around and interacts with you and eats fluff fruit and stuff and later bosses you have to like so meganium is really straightforward you can just keep taking pictures of meganium and then meganium's glowing with the illuminati and then if you throw them of pester balls not pester balls they'll get rid of that if you throw the illuminati balls then it will glow even more um in later bosses and i don't want to spoil what they are um like one of them is in the water and when you you have to hit it with an apple and then it comes out of the water and then you have to illuminate it itself it's not like the the meganium is like easy mode yeah so like you have to and you have to illuminate it to the point where it's like overflowing with illuminati because when when in in the in the water level when the pokemon i don't want to spoil it when the pokemon comes out of the water and i threw the illuminati ball and then i took a picture because it was glowing and i was like okay we're good and then i got to the end of the level and that was like the one time mirror yells at you and he's like you didn't get any photos and you're like what are you i took 70 what are you talking about i've maxed out my memory card and then he's like you didn't take any photos and they didn't really make it clear but you have to hit it at least i had to hit it twice because i was like apple you're out of the water illuminati ball you're glowing snap snap snap snap snap okay you went back in the water um and it was glowing and you could see in the picture it was glowing but it wasn't there's like a there's like levels of illuminati so like after the second ball he's now like push he's like pushing out that energy and that's the that's the snap he wanted so you're saying it's masculine it's again the legend it's crazy how many basklin there are is the masculines all the way down um the game is very good yeah i mean so i have more pros than cons i do have a couple of cons one is i can't select multiple pictures my other con is a lot of the times i feel that the controls are sludgy that they feel they feel unnecessarily slow uh and the fact that i can't start or stop my stupid machine like just let me stop my machine or speed up my machine just like that there is a speed up function near the end yeah which was on the first pokemon snap there's not a stop i have to like convince a pokemon to come get hit by my car so it stops so i can stop for a minute on the thing uh but i i do find the controls sometimes very i feel there are a couple of times where i felt the controls were fighting against me and i'm like just let me center and turn around and get everything and there's not like an easy button now i mean that's the difference if you want to turn around real fast you can actually use the d-pad yeah yeah like but like they can it just feels unnecessarily sludgy sometimes uh and that's just for listeners i thought it felt very slow but just a tip and greg knows this but you can use both sticks um so if you're like looking to the left with the left stick and then you use the right stick you can push also to the left and you can go faster right there's like settings that you can go into to like increase the mouse cursor speed yeah but it doesn't feel like it actually works it doesn't feel like it does anything you like crank it up like you like crank it all the way up and you're like this like it gives i think it starts at three it's like three out of ten yeah and i went to ten out of ten and i was like nothing changed exchange i bet seven out of ten like this is exactly the same the thing is that when you do the double switch it uncenters things and you have to try to ride them up again and and the controls are sometimes just kludgy that way the controls feel sometimes clutchy when you're trying to add uh stickers to photos like i feel like there could have been a bit more smoothness in the controls again all my complaints are really minor i think like i think the the levels feel a little grindy it's not a bad thing if you like it or if you're really just wanting to be in there i think the controls feel a little clutchy and i think they over explained at the beginning and under explain what they want at later times when you're trying to get pokemon problems like yeah i'm completely lost what do you want me to do i don't understand um did i even explain like i guess they kind of do like like if if you like professor mir kept yelling at me not yelling at me but there's like a certain point where he's like you should do the reef and you should look for a glowing flower right and but they don't explain this it's such a dumb thing though like again they don't they they over explain and then underexplain so i didn't realize it was the i think it was the park level he was like look for a glowing flower and i was like oh cool found it and then i found it but like and then i didn't think of taking a picture of it and then i went through the level again and he was like yeah you need to find the glowing flower finally i've done this i found it and i took a picture of it because i didn't select the glowing flower to show him yeah yeah that was the other he didn't except like it was in the folders so he was right there he was like find a glowing flower and you're like you hit it with the illumi and then it's like i found it and then he's like find a glowing flower and you're like i don't know what you want to do so you take a picture of it and then he's like oh cool and then he was like find a glowing flower and you're like oh i have to sh i have to have to show you the picture of the flower getting your photography badge is understanding the technicalities of being a photographer they could explain that uh he could literally just say i need a picture of a glowing flower this is literally a game about taking photos for a professor if all of those pieces don't come together in your brain it's not the game that's broken it is the confusing thing is when you when you look for those that haven't played it when you but they're in there like wow maybe greg and steve are just really dumb which i i'll take taking photos for a professor okay but here's the thing so when you find the flower you have to hit the y button or the x button and then it does like a little scan thing and it scans it and then you have to hold your cursor over and then hold the x button and it fills up a gauge and when it fills up the gauge it's like scanned but that's and that what that in itself makes it think like oh i scanned it and that data went back to the paper certain things that you do scan they accept so it it like you could ex scan this and it's like oh cool you found that noted but this is one of those things where it's like okay i found it i scanned it and i took a picture of it why are you still telling me that i have to do it oh you didn't put an exclamation part on that folder to remind me to go into that folder and specifically fix pick that picture and then have you look at it like there's just little pieces that are left out and it's again minor complaints but it's like you spent 4 000 years telling me how to point the camera you couldn't spend two seconds to say make sure you show me a picture of it one line of dialogue it's very weird um um i think i think the game looks beautiful i think all the pokemon look incredible i think they move so fluidly and so naturally and so comfort it's just comfortable to watch them you don't feel stressed watching it's a very zen game it's like watching uh mutual of omaha yeah all of those things i'm like yeah this is a good game uh i still feel a little on the fence because the grind about the price point but again if you i don't think that i don't think the price point is a big enough barrier to not get the game i think there's enough positives about the game to buy the game i have minor complaints but i i think the fact that i have minor complaints is is a boon to the game i thought the i thought the negative of the game was going to be it's too short i thought we i thought i was going to come into this podcast this week and be like pokemon snap is incredible it's super fun i had a smile on my face the entire time by the way it's five hours long that's what i thought i was going to say yeah like i never in the lead up to this game and they showed the same levels the same pokemon in all of these trailers and then they showed that boring corporate six minute trailer of like that that trailer so ruined the game yeah it was awful like that that seemed like something that was like internal to like nintendo staff of like all right here's that somehow i ended up on the youtube channel like some intern just hit the button it was like oh well it's out like hey hey we're selling pokemon snap in two weeks here's all the bullet points in a six minute trailer so when people call in to my nintendo support you can recite the like it was such a bad youtube video i don't know why they put it out yeah it's bad so like hearing like this game only has 200 pokemon if you've already played the first pokemon snap uh like i thought i was gonna say everything i was i thought i was gonna come into the show and be like i love this game i had amazing time i don't know if it's i don't know if 60 is worth like five hours of content the but the fact that i'm 20 hours in i'm halfway through the pokedex i'm so excited to go back there are levels i i need to unlock i've only done three boss fights and i think there's a couple more i have not i haven't unlocked levels i haven't gone back to some levels i haven't maxed out my research i i i want to try to diamond slash platinum everything because i i think that is fun and and i think it is doable like once you figure out like i will say watching irene beat your score on some pictures last night was pure joy yeah and she was like it was so weird for her going through like i'm so bad at this game and then like being like oh i just got 4 500 points on this picture like it's there there is like you don't have to be good at it like the game's scoring is pretty generous in spots yeah but it's just like fine tweaking but like sometimes you just happen to click the shutter at the right time and you got a good photo and it's as simple as that like just aim at a score bunny and just keep taking photos and one of them will be good like it'll it'll be fine um so yeah it was it was cool watching her play and just like seeing how much joy she had even though i didn't tell i was like don't worry about this don't worry about the illuminati don't worry about the scans don't worry about the music just go through and she had a great time um there are some levels that feel kind of boring compared to others like there's an underwater level um and i think the reason the underwater level is kind of like meh is because by the time you get to it it's like oh there's finney on oh wow they remembered finneyon was a pokemon and put into this game and then there's like oh there's magikarp okay magikarp has been on almost every level oh here's love disc well i just saw love diss the last level uh here's the lumineon so like that level felt really like i guess credidley's new and i guess claw litters knew yeah it's when a level has repeat ones and you're only seeing a few new things that that it feels a little it feels a little bit not bad it just feels like it the excitement isn't as strong yeah and then you get to that volcano level for the first time oh my gosh i lost my mind whoever made that volcano level they're the best level programmer ever yeah the like pacing of that is is good it is like all new pokemon it is good pokemon they're the backgrounds are incredible like that volcano level is mind-blowing like the park when you first do the park level you're you're not really blown away because that's like the one they showed in the trailer and so you kind of see everything and then you go through it at night and you're like okay that's cool and then there's like a jungle level and you're like okay jungle level school you see the jungle level at night and then there's like three water levels in a row um by the way it took me like 12 hours to get the volcano level and i'm still having a great time and i'm still good and i we i get to the volcano level and i am like i i think i used all 70 photos and i wasn't even halfway through the level like i was like i had to stop taking pictures towards the end i'm like oh i'm nowhere near the exit and i'm down to nine pictures these last nine pictures have to count like that volcano level is incredible um i will say the spoiler spoiler spoiler i i was in the no column because my favorite pokemon is not in the game and that had pushed me in the no column because i was not going to buy out of protest because how dare you not have my favorite pokemon in this game yeah there is uh i guess this is our last talking point because we're going on really long there is such a good variety of pokemon and they didn't i personally don't care about this i know some people do there's always there's always going to be those vocal people that are like there's it's all a gen one pandering and there is your charizard there is your venusaur there is your squirtle there's your charmander there's your bubble star i don't think there's any middles of those um and i'm i'm 20 hours in i haven't seen venusaur yet but obviously venusaur was in the trailer um there those pokemon exist uh and there's like a pidgey pidgeot there's no pidgey uh and there there are gen one pokemon but man they picked some cool pokemon to be in this game like like archeops is in this game archeops like the the dumb fossil bird that can barely fly they put in this game and it does what you think it does it it looks like it it's so dumb looking and it tries to fly away from another pokemon and it panics and they like do the screeching it is like perfect and really good he is so cool to see um the like finian and lumineon are in this like what phinean is it like normally if it was any other pokemon game it would have been golden it would have been golden and seeking because for whatever reason the pokemon company loves putting gold they gave nessa goldeen for whatever like a brand new jenna the gym leader let's give her goldie like why it's such a boring fish there you have it you have goodies a thousand water type pokemon and you're gonna just rely on golden for like it is like refreshing that there is no golden but they put finney on and lumineon and it's like wild to me that some of the pokemon they decided to put in this game they picked a good mix from all the generations just they did they did a really good job uh apart from personally insulting me i have no other complaints about the dlc that's the dlc well there are potential dlcs i could see that happening uh i could see them adding to the game if they wanted i don't i would like a a level just for me the one thing i do think is weird though is in the very first level in the park level you see a grookie and uh square bunny um and the square bunny gets a lot of love in this game he is in like three other levels he's pretty much as if there's no water in the level he's he's showing up uh and grooky not as much uh but i i know sabal's in the game it is mind-blowing to me that like i haven't triggered sable yet uh which is weird because he's in the trailer shooting water on a venusaur but it's just a little it just feels a little lopsided that like square bunny is like right out the gate and grookie is also right out the gate and they were like yeah well sobel yeah we will get solve the puzzle solve the puzzle all right pokemon of the week let's wrap this up is appleton in the game because appleton's not in your room anymore uh appleton is not in the room right now i cannot confirm or deny if appleton is in the game i will say that there are other gen 8 pokemon but you have to they're near the end of the game uh interesting there's a there's a couple that i've seen which is yeah it is yeah there are there's some cool oh okay one last thing sorry this is this is my complaint greg complained they i am not one for storytelling either i gravitate to a story in a video game or i don't and you have a very short so like with destiny when i first played destiny i was like i love everything about destiny didn't like the story at a certain point the story clicked with me i went back and i wanted to experience the whole thing and no one is i don't think anyone is purchasing pokemon snap because they wanted a 60 amazing story coming out of it but in my opinion they do this thing where they are trying to tell a story about i remember his name it's captain vince because it's very kind of generic yeah and they're and they do this thing where they just write off the gate in my opinion assume that you care and they do nothing i do they do nothing to establish why you should care about captain vince because we all grew up on stories of captain vince yeah i mean and there's like a certain point like 15 hours in where they're like here's a random picture of captain vince and they show captain vincent and they show a pokemon with captain vince and you're like well now i guess i kind of care because i know what he looks like and like like why didn't they just show that picture of the beginning like why they did you just didn't interpret the picture on the cover of the book they just they like kind of throw you into like we're doing this because captain vince found illuminati and we're trying to finish captain vince's thing and he and rita's like well captain vince didn't have any pictures they're all blurry and he's like yeah but but steve cares about captain vince and i was like bro i just got here off a train um what who is this rain what did you take to the islands geez it's just look i care about captain vince i've grown up my entire life hearing stories about the great captain vince and all of captain vince's incredible adventures they literally reminded me of that in the first minute of the game i realized that this may be a generational thing and you millennials don't care about captain vince anymore but when we were kids i mean i couldn't get enough captain ben's stories i'm sad that my parents got rid of my captain vince collection when i moved and went to college i mean it's heartbreaking and i have not been able to find those pieces since i've even friends with a person named vince in hopes of getting captain vince material the whole i thought the hope would be vince becomes the captain no i'd be like that's time that was not real no that's not gonna happen with that vince vince is not gonna become captain just i gave up on that question of the week we're not doing questions like it's too long oh yeah yeah sorry pokemon of the week all right take that slack no question for you so first off i have to admit i pulled the trick on everybody because i obviously the pokemon of the week last week was really short so i will read you the actual clue and then i will remind you of what the trick i pulled was so i said the clue was there are four pokemon games where you start the game when within a moving truck which pokemon is chasing the professor at the beginning of those games and then the trick was i interrupted myself and said wait greg were there five games where you start within a moving truck and greg said yes but the secret is in one of the five games the professor's being chased by a different pokemon and only in four of them is the professor being chased by who tell me it's chat shut up don't chase nobody no it's zigzagoon no craig in the four in the four it's puccieta pucciano one it's zigzague in emerald it's zigzag believe me people have been going like wait did he know one of them's different and i'm like yes yes it's pushienna in four of them and zigzagoon and emerald the best game in the entire series possibly potentially i no not potentially they've never topped it yeah it's owen pooch hyena is your answer is there good pujiana pooch hyena pooch hyena uh trivia i doubt it there's gotta be i mean this we all know the shiny is gold right it's gold and shiny and it's beautiful yeah the shiny is good and the shuffle icon is super cute with the super cute face here your trivia would be poochie yenna and it's evolved form share the same category with dreadnough they're all known as the bite pokemon pure dark pure dark it's just the bad guy fodder for g3 dag my hyena looks a lot like gallerian zigzagoon interesting what no it doesn't yeah yeah it does the stance and the coloring yeah tell me alligators look like crocodiles don't be ridiculous vince would not approve of this captainvis would not approve and they're also call the combination is called crackle gators do you think captain vince knows sir lawrence iii absolutely everybody knows sir lawrence
