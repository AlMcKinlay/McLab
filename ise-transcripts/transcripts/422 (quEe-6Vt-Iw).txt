it was fine (2:45 - 2:49)

people in america probably shouldn't (2:49 - 2:53)
complain because (2:52 - 2:55)
it was they weren't the ones that had (2:53 - 2:56)
the majority of the issues it was like (2:55 - 2:59)
new zealand and australia and asia that (2:56 - 2:59)
had (2:59 - 3:02)
way way way more issues than everywhere (2:59 - 3:03)

the fire and water (4:14 - 4:17)
segments and with this current i don't (4:15 - 4:19)
know what's happening in pokemon go (4:17 - 4:20)
right now but we're certainly (4:19 - 4:22)
certainly getting a lot of grasses i (4:20 - 4:24)
mean i'm happy that i'm able to make the (4:22 - 4:25)
progress on it (4:24 - 4:27)
uh even though i had to pay for more (4:25 - 4:30)
pokemon storage and yet also still (4:27 - 4:34)
transfer in quotes like 200 more pokemon (4:30 - 4:36)
for this whole thing to work but i mean (4:34 - 4:38)
i'm happy i get the opportunity to (4:36 - 4:41)
do the pokemon go fest stuff which i (4:38 - 4:42)
didn't do because i was (4:41 - 4:45)
yeah you know at a wedding you're one (4:42 - 4:46)

yeah they're i don't know if emogos and (5:22 - 5:26)
eggs but definitely swaddle and cotton (5:24 - 5:27)
earn eggs (5:26 - 5:29)
i just got a sawaddle and a cottony (5:27 - 5:30)
back-to-back there you go that's what (5:29 - 5:31)
i'm saying (5:30 - 5:34)
shiny rock and roller roller uh shiny (5:31 - 5:35)
rock and roll (5:34 - 5:39)
i got added buffalant is (5:35 - 5:42)
uh in new york somewhere uh genesect the (5:39 - 5:44)
mythical pokemon (5:42 - 5:46)
appearing in five star raids if you're (5:44 - 5:48)
looking for genesect (5:46 - 5:50)
if if you're if you're one of those uh (5:48 - 5:52)
people in the middle of nowhere with (5:50 - 5:55)
dial-up internet and one pokestop in (5:52 - 5:58)
your city of 500 people (5:55 - 6:01)
and you're looking for genesect uh both (5:58 - 6:03)
the slack community has been non-stop (6:01 - 6:05)
doing genesis with each other (6:03 - 6:07)
and the discord community is doing (6:05 - 6:10)
non-stop genesects with each other so (6:07 - 6:12)
it hasn't really been too hard to give (6:10 - 6:13)
it (6:12 - 6:15)
it's never been a better time to give (6:13 - 6:16)
niantic your money (6:15 - 6:20)
three premium raid passes at a time (6:16 - 6:22)
it's costing me so much money i'm having (6:20 - 6:24)
if issues with how much money this is (6:22 - 6:25)
costing me right now (6:24 - 6:26)
i'm not doing no more remote raids (6:25 - 6:28)
uh-uh-uh what (6:26 - 6:30)
what's the issue you have to pay for the (6:28 - 6:32)
passes you have to pay for the passes (6:30 - 6:33)
for regular raids (6:32 - 6:35)
no i get one free one every day that's (6:33 - 6:36)
the one i do that's (6:35 - 6:38)
here's the this is the five head (6:36 - 6:40)
strategy this is the big brain oh man (6:38 - 6:44)
you use your free one and you invite (6:40 - 6:46)
other people to it but then they have to (6:44 - 6:48)
pay i don't want to be the one who makes (6:46 - 6:49)
my friends have to pay for stuff (6:48 - 6:53)
they're adults i mean true in theory (6:49 - 6:54)
they're gonna they're gonna spend (6:53 - 6:56)
the money on genesect whether it's your (6:54 - 6:58)
rate or somebody else's so you might as (6:56 - 7:00)
well recruit them to help you defeat (6:58 - 7:01)
genocide (7:00 - 7:04)
but i have i have a research test which (7:01 - 7:06)
if i just bother to do it (7:04 - 7:09)
i'll get a genesect so what is the over (7:06 - 7:10)
what was the over (7:09 - 7:11)
under over was the over under on you (7:10 - 7:13)
completing that before friday (7:11 - 7:16)
before friday yeah wait what's the rush (7:13 - 7:17)
to get channel sect i don't need (7:16 - 7:18)
genesect before friday because we don't (7:17 - 7:19)
know if you're (7:18 - 7:22)
gonna turn off the shiny i don't need a (7:19 - 7:23)
shiny (7:22 - 7:26)
all right all right it's red they made a (7:23 - 7:27)
movie about it (7:26 - 7:30)
i mean i have a shiny genesect in my (7:27 - 7:31)
pokemon home (7:30 - 7:34)
i don't need no you don't (7:31 - 7:35)
i'm pretty sure there was a shiny (7:34 - 7:37)
genesect distribution dude (7:35 - 7:39)
specifically in japan it was never (7:37 - 7:40)
released in the united states (7:39 - 7:46)
i have japanese friends okay yeah yeah (7:40 - 7:47)
how do you search for things in pokemon (7:46 - 7:50)
home this is confusing as all heck (7:47 - 7:52)
oh good luck we can't spend an hour (7:50 - 7:54)
talking about how bad pokemon home is (7:52 - 7:58)
yeah we can i mean yes we can we (7:54 - 8:00)
we clearly can we shouldn't is what (7:58 - 8:01)
you're trying to say (8:00 - 8:04)
but we can clearly complete that task (8:01 - 8:06)
quite easily (8:04 - 8:09)
that one's purple hey speaking of (8:06 - 8:10)
pokemon home (8:09 - 8:12)
do you guys remember pokemon pass yeah i (8:10 - 8:15)
got that installed on my phone (8:12 - 8:18)
there's a new distribution for it at (8:15 - 8:18)
target (8:18 - 8:20)
i better reinstall it this is uh this is (8:18 - 8:22)
i just pulled this off sarah b's twitter (8:20 - 8:24)
a special dynamax crystal event to get (8:22 - 8:27)
giganta max copper raja is available in (8:24 - 8:27)
the us (8:27 - 8:31)
at gamestop through pokemon pass (8:27 - 8:33)
app remember last week when we said (8:31 - 8:34)
there's no way (8:33 - 8:36)
that the pokemon company would do a (8:34 - 8:37)
distribution that would cause a person (8:36 - 8:39)
to go outside of their house (8:37 - 8:42)
to a retail location to redeem a (8:39 - 8:44)
just a cop just just copper raja (8:42 - 8:46)
nothing's too special about it besides (8:44 - 8:49)
it hey it's gigantomax copperage (8:46 - 8:53)
true true from now until the 31st (8:49 - 8:56)
you can get a crystal that gets you (8:53 - 8:57)
gigantomax caparaja (8:56 - 9:02)
question mark is it special in any way (8:57 - 9:05)
nope it's gigantomax (9:02 - 9:07)
not all copperages can jug into mac's (9:05 - 9:08)
friends well (9:07 - 9:10)
if only there was like they can now soup (9:08 - 9:11)
in the game that (9:10 - 9:13)
yeah but then you gotta get all those (9:11 - 9:16)
mushrooms and the honeys and the (9:13 - 9:18)
this event did run in europe earlier (9:16 - 9:20)
this year i think in june (9:18 - 9:22)
and i think prior to that it ran in (9:20 - 9:24)
japan so i guess it's just making the (9:22 - 9:24)
rounds (9:24 - 9:28)
i my guess is (9:24 - 9:30)
my guess was that this was already (9:28 - 9:32)
established because it's august (9:30 - 9:34)
and they probably had a lot of things (9:32 - 9:35)
lined up for august (9:34 - 9:38)
because it was the world championship (9:35 - 9:40)
supposed to be this past weekend (9:38 - 9:42)
so what did they do last year during the (9:40 - 9:43)
world champion they had a game stop (9:42 - 9:45)
event last year and we all complained (9:43 - 9:47)
because there was no game stops in dc no (9:45 - 9:49)
game stops in dc correct (9:47 - 9:50)
what was it was not even that good of an (9:49 - 9:53)
event either it was pretty mediocre (9:50 - 9:55)
wasn't it like go to gamestop and get a (9:53 - 9:56)
sticker and pokemon pass (9:55 - 10:00)
he was like really bad that sounds about (9:56 - 10:01)
right i don't even think it was a (10:00 - 10:03)
pokemon i think was a sticker (10:01 - 10:05)
i thought they would just move this all (10:03 - 10:06)
the home though (10:05 - 10:08)
but again maybe they just made the deal (10:06 - 10:10)
with pass i don't (10:08 - 10:13)
with me who me what where is this (10:10 - 10:15)
distribution did you even say the store (10:13 - 10:16)
yeah gamestop (10:15 - 10:20)
no no no no that's not possible yeah (10:16 - 10:22)
dynamic dynamax crystal event through (10:20 - 10:24)
cop gigantomax copper raja available (10:22 - 10:26)
through gigantomax gamestop (10:24 - 10:28)
through the gigantomax pokemon pass app (10:26 - 10:30)
i can't hear it because (10:28 - 10:33)
gamestop isn't real no they're (10:30 - 10:36)
surviving by a thread i went to one in (10:33 - 10:37)
indianapolis (10:36 - 10:40)
a couple of weeks ago you are correct (10:37 - 10:41)
trying to find some magic cards (10:40 - 10:44)

up by the laundromat that i had to go to (10:44 - 10:50)
gamestop yeah did you get your caprara (10:46 - 10:51)

our bandwidth you eat up all of our (11:06 - 11:09)
water (11:08 - 11:12)
uh california get it together all right (11:09 - 11:14)
let's talk about the big news this week (11:12 - 11:14)
okay (11:14 - 11:19)
what is it the pokemon company (11:14 - 11:22)
have you heard of them owned by niantic (11:19 - 11:23)
yeah are they related to the pokemon (11:22 - 11:25)
company international (11:23 - 11:28)
no no okay that was a joke they're not (11:25 - 11:29)
owned by niantic (11:28 - 11:33)
the pokemon company decided that we (11:29 - 11:36)
we greg and will the royal we (11:33 - 11:39)
greg will myself are too powerful yes (11:36 - 11:43)
they launched their own podcast (11:39 - 11:46)
rival podcast we are now eternal enemies (11:43 - 11:49)
free advertising free advertising to (11:46 - 11:50)
your audience (11:49 - 11:51)
this audience could again blissfully (11:50 - 11:54)
aware that the pokemon company is (11:51 - 11:54)
attempting (11:54 - 11:57)
to take over our turf actually have you (11:54 - 11:59)
listened to their podcast (11:57 - 12:01)
i have not i have i listened to the (11:59 - 12:02)
whole thing this morning (12:01 - 12:04)
it's actually i did too it's actually (12:02 - 12:06)
really nice and i can also say (12:04 - 12:08)
not a direct competitor to the content (12:06 - 12:10)
that we provide in the slightest (12:08 - 12:13)
bit yeah so um it's (12:10 - 12:16)
it's called the play pokemon podcast (12:13 - 12:20)
it is hosted by jay blake who works at (12:16 - 12:21)
the pokemon company i met (12:20 - 12:25)
jay at the 2008 (12:21 - 12:27)
national or world championship in (12:25 - 12:28)
nashville (12:27 - 12:30)
dm'd me on twitter that weekend and then (12:28 - 12:31)
we met up (12:30 - 12:33)
and uh he's a very nice guy he's the (12:31 - 12:35)
host uh he has a very (12:33 - 12:38)
very good hosting voice uh i think his (12:35 - 12:40)
accent can be a little confusing at (12:38 - 12:40)
times (12:40 - 12:43)
what i like his voice his voice is nice (12:40 - 12:46)
his accent can be a little confusing (12:43 - 12:47)
what because you can't tell what the (12:46 - 12:51)
accent is i'm not british (12:47 - 12:53)
so some of his word pronunciations are a (12:51 - 12:55)
little difficult (12:53 - 12:58)
it's all the extra unnecessary uses make (12:55 - 12:58)
it (12:58 - 13:00)
very confusing like why is there you in (12:58 - 13:02)
there it doesn't need it (13:00 - 13:05)
this seems like uh their their (13:02 - 13:06)
episodes are dropping like every (13:05 - 13:08)
wednesday and i think their final (13:06 - 13:09)
episode will be (13:08 - 13:10)
september 9th that's what at least says (13:09 - 13:12)
on pokemon.com it says oh so it's like a (13:10 - 13:13)
short run (13:12 - 13:15)
yeah look forward to new episodes every (13:13 - 13:16)
wednesday through september 9th they (13:15 - 13:18)
even say that near the end of the (13:16 - 13:20)
first episode of the podcast where they (13:18 - 13:22)
said it was like (13:20 - 13:25)
we're covering the championship series (13:22 - 13:29)
and then we're done so so this is like (13:25 - 13:31)
cereal (13:29 - 13:34)
yes uh you won't believe the pokemon who (13:31 - 13:35)
murdered (13:34 - 13:39)
uh so what so is (13:35 - 13:39)
twisted turns left and right turns left (13:41 - 13:44)
and right i mean what they did with the (13:43 - 13:46)
cell phone records will probably make me (13:44 - 13:47)
just as angry (13:46 - 13:50)
i got asked the question a lot this week (13:47 - 13:51)
on twitch (13:50 - 13:56)
which was are you worried about them (13:51 - 13:58)
but yeah there i don't think anyone (13:56 - 14:01)
listening to it's super effective goes (13:58 - 14:03)
oh wait there's an official podcast that (14:01 - 14:04)
is so super competitive (14:03 - 14:07)
and not like covering news i'm going to (14:04 - 14:08)
go over there and stop listening (14:07 - 14:12)
super competitive absolutely (14:08 - 14:17)
like yeah their show is the it is like (14:12 - 14:17)
the (14:17 - 14:20)
i don't know football coverage of like (14:17 - 14:21)
games (14:20 - 14:24)
very much it's very very competitive i (14:21 - 14:26)
i find it i don't know if i'm sure this (14:24 - 14:28)
pokemon fan exists (14:26 - 14:31)
but i don't know how many there are what (14:28 - 14:32)
it was that thing called the venn (14:31 - 14:33)
diagram (14:32 - 14:36)
or you got the circles yeah (14:33 - 14:38)
of a competitive first off you have to (14:36 - 14:40)
like competitive pokemon (14:38 - 14:42)
one that's number one number two circle (14:40 - 14:43)
one is (14:42 - 14:48)
there's not i've gone to countless (14:43 - 14:51)
regionals battle roads uh (14:48 - 14:54)
champion cups uh worlds nationals (14:51 - 14:58)
there is already an extremely small (14:54 - 14:59)
overlap (14:58 - 15:01)
at these at these big tournaments of (14:59 - 15:03)
somebody who loves (15:01 - 15:06)
vgc and somebody who loves tcg (15:03 - 15:10)
oh uh don't forget pokken tournament (15:06 - 15:11)
because that's up in there too right (15:10 - 15:13)
that's something so if (15:11 - 15:16)
to find a person that likes all three (15:13 - 15:18)
and like you don't i don't know if it's (15:16 - 15:19)
possible to (15:18 - 15:23)
like dedicate yourself to all three even (15:19 - 15:25)
i guess you could respect it you could (15:23 - 15:27)
respect it i guess and be like ah i (15:25 - 15:29)
don't play pokemon tournament but i love (15:27 - 15:30)
watching competitive pokemon tournament (15:29 - 15:31)
or like (15:30 - 15:34)
i i don't play competitive tcg but i (15:31 - 15:35)
love watching it but i (15:34 - 15:39)
do play and like competitive vg (15:35 - 15:42)
see maybe that exists (15:39 - 15:44)
well it's the person like me who goes uh (15:42 - 15:47)
to day one to play the tcg (15:44 - 15:49)
scrubs out and then plays the bgc on day (15:47 - 15:51)
two and scrubs (15:49 - 15:52)
out i i think the other focus of the (15:51 - 15:54)
podcast as they wanted to bring (15:52 - 15:58)
to light players what i noticed a lot (15:54 - 16:01)
in the so the the show is actually (15:58 - 16:02)
formatted really (16:01 - 16:05)
really well um jay (16:02 - 16:08)
talks to people specifically in that (16:05 - 16:09)
field right (16:08 - 16:11)
so yeah you're the vgc person you're the (16:09 - 16:13)
tcg person you're the poke intern (16:11 - 16:16)
person um so i think it's i think it was (16:13 - 16:17)
structured really well (16:16 - 16:18)
but i can i can easily see somebody (16:17 - 16:20)
who's like listening to the (16:18 - 16:22)
the video game part and then it gets to (16:20 - 16:23)
like the tcg part and they're like i (16:22 - 16:24)
don't care (16:23 - 16:28)
i'm out um which those people exist like (16:24 - 16:30)
i like i don't care about pokken at all (16:28 - 16:32)
but i was like (16:30 - 16:33)
i wanna listen to it because i'm just (16:32 - 16:35)
curious of like what happens after the (16:33 - 16:36)
pokemon stuff but (16:35 - 16:39)
yeah it's very much like an espn program (16:36 - 16:40)
where they're like (16:39 - 16:42)
you know this player because right it's (16:40 - 16:43)
not just a general (16:42 - 16:45)
it's definitely not like here's how to (16:43 - 16:47)
get good at being competitive that that (16:45 - 16:48)
is not there at all (16:47 - 16:51)
but it's really a lot of stats and (16:48 - 16:53)
figures about like (16:51 - 16:54)
this is how many times this particular (16:53 - 16:56)
pokemon has shown up in (16:54 - 16:58)
you know the top competitions and these (16:56 - 17:00)
are the players who are making it to (16:58 - 17:00)
like the (17:00 - 17:03)
final of finals of the play pokemon (17:00 - 17:05)
where right like where it's sp specific (17:03 - 17:07)
for the top (17:05 - 17:09)
players and calling them out as if (17:07 - 17:10)
they're kind of like (17:09 - 17:12)
sports personalities that we should know (17:10 - 17:15)
i have no idea who shadow cat is but i (17:12 - 17:16)
haven't heard that we can talk about (17:15 - 17:16)
that (17:16 - 17:20)
20 times it was i mean shadow cat's dark (17:16 - 17:20)
right (17:20 - 17:21)
supposedly i need to care about this (17:20 - 17:23)
that's true yeah (17:21 - 17:26)
it's it was i hate esports it's so (17:23 - 17:30)
jarring to go from like in the video (17:26 - 17:30)
game (17:30 - 17:32)
where they're they're talking about (17:30 - 17:33)
players real names (17:32 - 17:36)
oh yeah they talk about wolf glick yep (17:33 - 17:37)
and then (17:36 - 17:40)
they talk about there's real names and (17:37 - 17:41)
then in the (17:40 - 17:44)
pokken they're like ah shadowcat is is (17:41 - 17:46)
fighting blaze it 420 (17:44 - 17:49)
and then after that 69 69 is going to (17:46 - 17:52)
come on in and oh my gosh his samurai is (17:49 - 17:54)
incredible and you should see (17:52 - 17:57)
big joe four four four two nine (17:54 - 17:59)
seven two three eight with his gengar (17:57 - 18:01)
out and you're like (17:59 - 18:04)
what how did we get here what are these (18:01 - 18:05)
names (18:04 - 18:07)
i agree especially if these are people (18:05 - 18:08)
who have like (18:07 - 18:11)
you know gone to invitationals and won (18:08 - 18:12)
their spot (18:11 - 18:15)
in a set of finals because of like you (18:12 - 18:17)
should know what their real names are at (18:15 - 18:18)
this point (18:17 - 18:20)
unless there's like something about just (18:18 - 18:21)
like because (18:20 - 18:25)
in particular this is an east but bgc is (18:21 - 18:26)
just as much as an esport i (18:25 - 18:29)
i don't know right that they need to be (18:26 - 18:30)
protected (18:29 - 18:33)
or hide behind their aliases i hm (18:30 - 18:36)
i i think in like league of legends and (18:33 - 18:37)
dota they (18:36 - 18:38)
they use their names just because the (18:37 - 18:40)
names appear over the character on (18:38 - 18:41)
screen (18:40 - 18:43)
yeah um and so it's easier for you to (18:41 - 18:44)
like follow that instead of the being (18:43 - 18:45)
like oh (18:44 - 18:47)
big i don't know i'm going with big nate (18:45 - 18:49)
bignate is (18:47 - 18:52)
xx layer 420 xx and you're like it's (18:49 - 18:54)
hard to remember two things so you just (18:52 - 18:56)
say xxx layer 420. (18:54 - 18:59)
but when when it i don't know in pokemon (18:56 - 19:00)
tournament it's two people (18:59 - 19:03)
and they're your your username i don't (19:00 - 19:05)
think appears in the game and they're (19:03 - 19:06)
going to overlay the (19:05 - 19:08)
the name over it anyways that's pretty (19:06 - 19:09)
sure it does (19:08 - 19:12)
does it pretty sure um but that's not as (19:09 - 19:13)
confusing (19:12 - 19:15)
to follow as like a mobo where it's like (19:13 - 19:16)
five people versus five people it's just (19:15 - 19:18)
one versus one (19:16 - 19:20)
i i think there's a i think there's just (19:18 - 19:21)
a pro i don't know i (19:20 - 19:24)
i i feel like i relate better to real (19:21 - 19:26)
names (19:24 - 19:28)
i mean like ray rizzo wolf glick aaron (19:26 - 19:29)
zang you know these these are (19:28 - 19:32)
these are names cybertron you mean (19:29 - 19:33)
cybertron (19:32 - 19:36)
thank you very much these are (19:33 - 19:39)
names that people recognize in the vgc (19:36 - 19:42)
and then the tcg you have like jason (19:39 - 19:46)
klinsky and you have um ross j (19:42 - 19:49)
clay j j clay it was just (19:46 - 19:52)
jarring in the show to go from like real (19:49 - 19:54)
name real name real name to then (19:52 - 19:57)
like username yep i agree you're talking (19:54 - 19:59)
to a person that can't run proposed real (19:57 - 20:00)
names but i can remember their twitter (19:59 - 20:01)
handles (20:00 - 20:04)
so like that doesn't bother me (20:01 - 20:08)
i would be curious though like if people (20:04 - 20:10)
who have never listened to a podcast (20:08 - 20:11)
before (20:10 - 20:14)
because so i i got really lucky with (20:11 - 20:18)
seo back in the day and (20:14 - 20:20)
if you go to itunes and you search (20:18 - 20:22)
pokemon podcast we come up first (20:20 - 20:25)
so it's not like it's hard to find the (20:22 - 20:26)
show (20:25 - 20:30)
and we're gonna win an award hopefully (20:26 - 20:33)
but to get a person to be like (20:30 - 20:35)
i wonder if there's a pokemon podcast (20:33 - 20:37)
that's that's the struggle (20:35 - 20:39)
um because if they if they go to itunes (20:37 - 20:40)
they type it in they find it they listen (20:39 - 20:41)
to it they don't like it (20:40 - 20:46)
we we tried not gonna appeal to everyone (20:41 - 20:47)
um but there are plenty of people that (20:46 - 20:49)
haven't even thought or considered (20:47 - 20:51)
looking at a pokemon podcast (20:49 - 20:54)
so i'd be curious if somebody's never (20:51 - 20:55)
listened to a podcast (20:54 - 20:57)
they listen to the play pokemon podcast (20:55 - 20:59)
they like it (20:57 - 21:02)
the play pokemon podcast ends and then (20:59 - 21:03)
they go i wonder if there are other (21:02 - 21:05)
pokemon podcasts to listen to and then (21:03 - 21:07)
they'll find that there's a ton of shows (21:05 - 21:08)
out there (21:07 - 21:10)
but it's cool for them to do this i (21:08 - 21:11)
think i (21:10 - 21:13)
i i told the story i don't know if i (21:11 - 21:15)
told the story on the podcast where i (21:13 - 21:16)
was like trying to reach out to nintendo (21:15 - 21:19)
and stuff back in the day to get copies (21:16 - 21:20)
of pokemon (21:19 - 21:22)
and they would always they would always (21:20 - 21:24)
when i would ask and reach out like hey (21:22 - 21:25)
i'm a content creator (21:24 - 21:26)
they would be like well what's your (21:25 - 21:30)
youtube at the time i didn't do youtube (21:26 - 21:31)
i didn't you know i started doing (21:30 - 21:33)
youtube this year because i was (21:31 - 21:35)
producing so much twitch content that (21:33 - 21:36)
not everyone could watch that we moved (21:35 - 21:38)
it over to youtube i would always say (21:36 - 21:40)
like i'm not a youtuber i'm a podcaster (21:38 - 21:40)
and they're (21:40 - 21:42)
they're responsible as oh we don't do (21:40 - 21:43)
podcasts (21:42 - 21:46)
and it was like it's like this weird (21:43 - 21:47)
time where now nintendo does do a (21:46 - 21:49)
podcast it's like the nintendo power (21:47 - 21:51)
podcast that comes out once a month (21:49 - 21:52)
and now it's like this really weird time (21:51 - 21:54)
where the pokemon company is doing a (21:52 - 21:55)
podcast (21:54 - 21:57)
so being told for so long that like oh (21:55 - 22:00)
we don't do podcasts and now it's like (21:57 - 22:03)
okay cool you guys now but i also feel (22:00 - 22:05)
like every corporate (22:03 - 22:07)
company every corporate company is not a (22:05 - 22:09)
real thing every (22:07 - 22:12)
company i feel like is doing a podcast (22:09 - 22:12)
just like (22:12 - 22:15)
every company like needs a twitter tied (22:12 - 22:17)
has a twitter but i don't think anyone (22:15 - 22:19)
goes like oh man i (22:17 - 22:21)
really like laundry detergent oh god (22:19 - 22:23)
good thing tide is on twitter i would (22:21 - 22:25)

long time but now you just gave me a (22:30 - 22:33)
reason to get back on (22:31 - 22:36)
i love tides options of sense i'm a (22:33 - 22:39)
i'm a tied dude i feel like it's a very (22:36 - 22:40)
common thing now with like (22:39 - 22:45)
just companies is can we do a podcast (22:40 - 22:48)
and if we can do it how are we gonna do (22:45 - 22:48)
it (22:48 - 22:50)
but cool to see them do it i thought it (22:48 - 22:52)
was worth listening (22:50 - 22:56)
oh i agree i'll get to it (22:52 - 22:58)

charizard in it it looks like we have a (24:06 - 24:09)
burning shadows also sought after (24:07 - 24:10)
because (24:09 - 24:13)
there happens to also be a charizard in (24:10 - 24:14)
that one (24:13 - 24:16)
[Laughter] (24:14 - 24:18)

charizard (24:18 - 24:22)
well darkness ablaze charizard let me (24:19 - 24:24)
char charring your blaze as charizard (24:22 - 24:25)
tell you there is (24:24 - 24:28)
indeed a charizard in darkness ablaze (24:25 - 24:30)
but what what if they just skipped it (24:28 - 24:33)
and just put out an all charizard (24:30 - 24:35)
all char every type of charmander (24:33 - 24:36)
charizard (24:35 - 24:38)
charmeleon just that's all the cards (24:36 - 24:40)
it's just an entire fire (24:38 - 24:43)
no see no one likes charmeleon or (24:40 - 24:46)
charmander people just want (24:43 - 24:46)
that's a base pokemon you don't need the (24:52 - 24:56)
ones below it (24:54 - 24:58)
i mean we could you know sprinkle them (24:56 - 25:01)
some cinderache nobody wants cinderacci (24:58 - 25:04)
everybody wants cinderacci oh speaking (25:01 - 25:04)
of cinder (25:04 - 25:08)
cinderease uh in in the (25:04 - 25:10)
in the play pokemon podcast i i don't (25:08 - 25:11)
know if you noticed this will (25:10 - 25:13)
in the in the video game part they kept (25:11 - 25:15)
bringing up stats (25:13 - 25:17)
uh-huh they kept saying like oh (25:15 - 25:18)
willowboom's number one on the (25:17 - 25:20)
leaderboard and togekiss is number three (25:18 - 25:21)
and like (25:20 - 25:24)
uh incineroar is number two yes drag (25:21 - 25:26)
algae is like number 18 or something (25:24 - 25:29)
this is my question are they using (25:26 - 25:30)
picolytics for that a (25:29 - 25:32)
non-official pokemon source to talk (25:30 - 25:34)
about on an official pokemon podcast or (25:32 - 25:36)
do they actually have stats (25:34 - 25:39)
they have stats dude you think so stats (25:36 - 25:40)
do you think that 800 (25:39 - 25:43)
that database is getting populated for (25:40 - 25:46)
every single battle that occurs (25:43 - 25:46)
if they're not doing that then i want (25:47 - 25:51)
them fired because (25:49 - 25:52)
what is the point of being connected (25:51 - 25:54)
online if they aren't stealing my data (25:52 - 25:57)
and learning how i play the game exactly (25:54 - 25:58)
yeah i'm not saying i'm not saying the (25:57 - 26:00)
poke i'm not saying game freak doesn't (25:58 - 26:01)
have stats (26:00 - 26:03)
but game freak would be the ones (26:01 - 26:04)
receiving the stats (26:03 - 26:06)
and then they would have to send it over (26:04 - 26:08)
to the fine people (26:06 - 26:11)
in at working at the pokemon company yes (26:08 - 26:13)
in washington are you saying that the (26:11 - 26:14)
pokemon company (26:13 - 26:17)
does not automatically get those reports (26:14 - 26:18)
because that's pretty much how (26:17 - 26:20)
businesses were not even reports (26:18 - 26:23)
i can guarantee that they have like an (26:20 - 26:25)
app that's built on built on some (26:23 - 26:27)
platform that's like literally called (26:25 - 26:29)
like pokemon battle stats that's like (26:27 - 26:31)
real time updated you can just go (26:29 - 26:34)
and you have a dashboard of like here's (26:31 - 26:36)
all the pokemon that have been used (26:34 - 26:37)
yeah but where did they copy and paste (26:36 - 26:39)
it from uh the ucs (26:37 - 26:41)
that remember when gts had that running (26:39 - 26:43)
oh yeah on the website (26:41 - 26:45)
they just took that and slapped it up (26:43 - 26:46)
there they actually probably have it on (26:45 - 26:48)
monitors all around their call center (26:46 - 26:50)
and they just have like the ticker tape (26:48 - 26:51)
going top ten (26:50 - 26:54)
well i mean usually sell the (26:51 - 26:56)
boom seller boom braille boom sound (26:54 - 26:58)
special uh extra bonus if you sell real (26:56 - 27:00)
boom right now (26:58 - 27:03)
um usually after uh (27:00 - 27:05)
like a tournament like the may (27:03 - 27:07)
international they do post like the top (27:05 - 27:09)
20 pokemon being used but they don't (27:07 - 27:11)
i don't think they ever show percentages (27:09 - 27:12)
not to the public but (27:11 - 27:14)
you know they have them internally yeah (27:12 - 27:16)
i know they i'm not saying they don't (27:14 - 27:17)
have it (27:16 - 27:19)
i'm just saying so the official pokemon (27:17 - 27:20)
people on their (27:19 - 27:24)
official pokemon podcast have access to (27:20 - 27:24)
those official (27:24 - 27:27)
pokemon stats yeah (27:24 - 27:29)
why don't you think that game freak (27:27 - 27:31)
would share that's what i don't (27:29 - 27:32)
understand (27:31 - 27:34)
because gamefreak is so bad at (27:32 - 27:36)
communicating (27:34 - 27:40)
to you not to their overalls (27:36 - 27:40)
what is the reason because who cares (27:40 - 27:45)
about who cares about the consumer (27:43 - 27:47)
you need to keep your overlords happy (27:45 - 27:49)
that's the bottom line shareholders (27:47 - 27:50)
first (27:49 - 27:53)
then then consumers then (27:50 - 27:56)
businesses then your artists (27:53 - 27:59)
and then like at 400th place is the (27:56 - 28:00)
consumer (27:59 - 28:04)
oh okay and then after that's employees (28:00 - 28:06)
employees are always at the bottom final (28:04 - 28:07)
bit of dues here (28:06 - 28:08)
oh and japan's at the very bottom (28:07 - 28:09)
because they don't tell those people (28:08 - 28:10)
anything yeah they don't have internet (28:09 - 28:11)
out there (28:10 - 28:15)
final bit of news is darkness ablaze (28:11 - 28:19)
is available it's out it's here how (28:15 - 28:21)
how many darkness ablaze packs did you (28:19 - 28:22)
open (28:21 - 28:25)
uh zero i have not gotten my order yet (28:22 - 28:27)
i did order and then your twitch stream (28:25 - 28:28)
was a lie (28:27 - 28:30)
no well were we talking real packs or (28:28 - 28:32)
digital packs i've opened it doesn't (28:30 - 28:32)
matter i (28:32 - 28:34)
asked a simple question how many did you (28:32 - 28:36)
open i opened 100 (28:34 - 28:39)
digital packs i have opened zero real (28:36 - 28:40)
packs (28:39 - 28:42)
why are you throwing money away (28:40 - 28:43)
everybody knows that you trade packs for (28:42 - 28:44)
the pokemon you want (28:43 - 28:46)
that's true i opened the packs which (28:44 - 28:48)
ruined actually i had (28:46 - 28:52)
i had some sick gnarly opens will (28:48 - 28:54)
i was you know turning this you had some (28:52 - 28:57)
garlic as those of us in the tcg world (28:54 - 28:58)
call them i pulled (28:57 - 29:02)
some gnarly pokemon true some (28:58 - 29:05)
gnarly digital cards that mean nothing (29:02 - 29:08)
let's take away that frost take away (29:05 - 29:09)
from my (29:08 - 29:13)
my my pokemon uh i so i i think the (29:09 - 29:15)
the two best cards that you could (29:13 - 29:18)
probably pull from the set is (29:15 - 29:22)
uh crobat v the world tour (29:18 - 29:25)
the year is 2020 crobat is relevant (29:22 - 29:26)
again and (29:25 - 29:29)
uh alternative eternitis v max although (29:26 - 29:30)
i guess it turned into (29:29 - 29:34)
v-max is not useful without eternitis (29:30 - 29:38)
v but why because you have to (29:34 - 29:39)
you can't just play the v-max you gotta (29:38 - 29:41)
play the v and then play the v max on (29:39 - 29:42)
top of it (29:41 - 29:46)
oh what are they doing break cards again (29:42 - 29:49)
well v max cards are on top of the v (29:46 - 29:51)
cards i did not i was not aware of that (29:49 - 29:52)
mechanic i'm out (29:51 - 29:56)
oh gets that what whatever uh but on (29:52 - 29:58)
pokemon.com (29:56 - 29:59)
this is why we're having a lawsuits what (29:58 - 30:03)
that is on pokemon.com (29:59 - 30:05)
they they showcase the cards like they (30:03 - 30:06)
always have but they've actually (30:05 - 30:08)
showcased them in a way oh there's 185 (30:06 - 30:10)
cards in this set they've showcased them (30:08 - 30:11)
in a way where they (30:10 - 30:13)
they show you them working together (30:11 - 30:15)
which i feel like (30:13 - 30:16)
they might have done this before but i (30:15 - 30:18)
don't feel like they do it often (30:16 - 30:21)
i just want to just go through this they (30:18 - 30:23)
they showcase eternitis v max with (30:21 - 30:24)
crowbat v (30:23 - 30:26)
and they actually say why it's relevant (30:24 - 30:28)
here so eternitus is v (30:26 - 30:31)
max's dread end does 30 damage for each (30:28 - 30:33)
dark pokemon in play (30:31 - 30:36)
plus play corobat v which is a dark (30:33 - 30:36)
pokemon (30:36 - 30:39)
and use its dark assist ability to draw (30:36 - 30:41)
more cards hopefully finding more dark (30:39 - 30:42)
pokemon in play (30:41 - 30:44)
also you could probably put crowbat v (30:42 - 30:46)
like any deck (30:44 - 30:48)
but it works good here and then they (30:46 - 30:49)
have (30:48 - 30:52)
uh four cards and they all have the (30:49 - 30:54)
they all have the same move which is (30:52 - 30:55)
called mad (30:54 - 30:58)
party uh and then mad party so it's a (30:55 - 30:59)
bundle b (30:58 - 31:02)
a didn't a a polti geiss and a mr (30:59 - 31:05)
rhyme oh that's funny uh mad party does (31:02 - 31:08)
20 damage for each pokemon in your (31:05 - 31:10)
discard pile that has the mad party (31:08 - 31:11)
attack (31:10 - 31:13)
if you haven't played the tcg you're (31:11 - 31:16)
probably like what what does that mean (31:13 - 31:18)
um but they actually compare it to (31:16 - 31:20)
something here on the website (31:18 - 31:22)
reminiscent of old night march decks (31:20 - 31:24)
from x and y series bundle b (31:22 - 31:27)
didn't a polti guys and mr rhyme all (31:24 - 31:28)
have the mad party attack (31:27 - 31:31)
which does 20 damage per pokemon in your (31:28 - 31:33)
discard pile that has the mad party (31:31 - 31:35)
attack discard as many cards as you can (31:33 - 31:36)
to do some damage so (31:35 - 31:39)
you would probably never play mr rhyme (31:36 - 31:41)
down or polti geist down because they're (31:39 - 31:42)
evolutions of cards (31:41 - 31:45)
you would just want to discard them and (31:42 - 31:47)
so if you're familiar with night march (31:45 - 31:49)
and the night march mechanic this is the (31:47 - 31:51)
new night march they're just (31:49 - 31:54)
renamed mad party are we spoiling this (31:51 - 31:56)
for the children greg (31:54 - 31:59)
no okay and the last combo they show (31:56 - 32:02)
on the website is rose and rudos tower (31:59 - 32:05)
uh rose which is a supporter card you're (32:02 - 32:07)
allowed to play one supporter card on (32:05 - 32:07)
your turn (32:07 - 32:10)
rose lets you attach two basic energies (32:07 - 32:12)
cards from your discard pile (32:10 - 32:15)
to one of your pokemon v-max (32:12 - 32:17)
ironically that works really good with (32:15 - 32:18)
eternitis (32:17 - 32:21)
but it comes at the cost of discarding (32:18 - 32:22)
your entire (32:21 - 32:25)
hand but rose tower which is a stadium (32:22 - 32:27)
card will let you get (32:25 - 32:29)
we'll let you draw three cards to get a (32:27 - 32:31)
fresh hand (32:29 - 32:34)
so very good if you have only if you (32:31 - 32:35)
have rows and another card in your hand (32:34 - 32:36)
you discard (32:35 - 32:38)
row you play rows put two energies on (32:36 - 32:40)
discard your the other card in your hand (32:38 - 32:42)
but with rose tower you draw three more (32:40 - 32:44)
cards and you can continue your return (32:42 - 32:47)
so that combo is also very good i don't (32:44 - 32:48)
know pokemon company (32:47 - 32:50)
if you're listening i know you i look i (32:48 - 32:51)
know there are people that (32:50 - 32:54)
work there that listen to our show do (32:51 - 32:56)
more of this this is really really (32:54 - 32:58)
good explain like why these cards work (32:56 - 33:00)
together in in a very simple way (32:58 - 33:03)
yeah also the card decks app got an (33:00 - 33:05)
update it is still useless (33:03 - 33:09)
as there is no account or cloud saved (33:05 - 33:12)
i am i have never made an ios app (33:09 - 33:14)
i i know plenty of people that have made (33:12 - 33:16)
ios apps (33:14 - 33:18)
i'm pretty sure it's really easy to use (33:16 - 33:20)
apple's icloud save feature (33:18 - 33:23)
in your app i mean you would think (33:20 - 33:24)
because they want people (33:23 - 33:26)
to they want to move people towards that (33:24 - 33:27)
yeah just i (33:26 - 33:29)
maybe they just don't maybe they don't (33:27 - 33:31)
want to use icloud i don't (33:29 - 33:34)
if only they had like like something (33:31 - 33:34)
called (33:34 - 33:39)
like a trainer trainer club account that (33:34 - 33:41)
links to the pokemon trading card game (33:39 - 33:42)
online app and links to (33:41 - 33:46)
i don't know pokemon go as well (33:42 - 33:49)
if only they had like a system in place (33:46 - 33:52)
they could link to the card decks app (33:49 - 33:53)
what a world that would be right right (33:52 - 33:54)
we don't live there (33:53 - 33:56)
for anyone that doesn't know there's an (33:54 - 33:58)
official pokemon (33:56 - 34:02)
app in the uh on android and ios called (33:58 - 34:05)
card decks and what it does is it it it (34:02 - 34:08)
category it catalogs your collection so (34:05 - 34:09)
if you bought a bunch of cards if you (34:08 - 34:11)
bought a set of dark displays and you're (34:09 - 34:12)
like i want to (34:11 - 34:15)
collect them all but with real money (34:12 - 34:18)
you can use the camera on the back of (34:15 - 34:19)
your phone and scan (34:18 - 34:21)
just hold it over the card and then it (34:19 - 34:23)
will add it to the collection (34:21 - 34:25)
so you can open up a booster pack scan (34:23 - 34:26)
the 10 cards (34:25 - 34:28)
be like oh i already had this one or oh (34:26 - 34:29)
i didn't have this one (34:28 - 34:32)
add it to your collection but if you (34:29 - 34:33)
were to transfer your data to a new (34:32 - 34:34)
phone (34:33 - 34:37)
and set up as new or you you lost your (34:34 - 34:40)
phone and you need a new phone or (34:37 - 34:43)
your kid hit the erase and install (34:40 - 34:45)
button on your phone or just delete it (34:43 - 34:45)
if (34:45 - 34:48)
just if you delete the app on accident (34:45 - 34:50)
your whole you're riding a bike you're (34:48 - 34:52)
holding a coffee your pokeball plusing (34:50 - 34:53)
your fingers on the car decks app for (34:52 - 34:55)
too long it starts doing the jiggly (34:53 - 34:55)
thing (34:55 - 34:57)
you accidentally hit the x you deleted (34:55 - 35:00)
it all your data is gone (34:57 - 35:03)
in an app about cattle cataloging (35:00 - 35:06)
your data why would anyone use this if (35:03 - 35:08)
there was not a backup feature (35:06 - 35:10)
it's very frustrating so still cannot (35:08 - 35:11)
recommend that (35:10 - 35:14)
that's it that's all the news so what (35:11 - 35:15)
we're gonna do is we're to take a quick (35:14 - 35:16)
break (35:15 - 35:20)

but (36:44 - 36:46)
uh we're gonna be i'm gonna be asking uh (36:44 - 36:48)
joshua a bunch of questions pokemon and (36:46 - 36:50)
ign related (36:48 - 36:51)
for our listeners or for anyone coming (36:50 - 36:53)
over and some are probably like (36:51 - 36:56)
maybe obvious questions if they consume (36:53 - 36:58)
you or follow you on twitter (36:56 - 36:59)
well i hope you're not consuming me oh (36:58 - 37:03)
gosh so sorry in advance if you're like (36:59 - 37:06)
uh i just tweeted that a week ago (37:03 - 37:09)
no problem before we start you (37:06 - 37:12)
work at ign uh for anyone who doesn't (37:09 - 37:12)
know what do you (37:12 - 37:15)
what do you do yeah i've been working at (37:12 - 37:16)
ign (37:15 - 37:19)
uh over six years now yeah i moved to (37:16 - 37:19)
los (37:19 - 37:22)
angeles six years ago to work at ign and (37:19 - 37:23)
i (37:22 - 37:27)
am a senior uh editor and producer (37:23 - 37:30)
of features which means i just uh write (37:27 - 37:32)
and talk and make videos about (37:30 - 37:34)
everything like movies video games (37:32 - 37:36)
tv comic books you name it that's (37:34 - 37:39)
awesome and uh pokemon is one of those (37:36 - 37:42)
things yes pokemon is a huge passion of (37:39 - 37:43)
mine (37:42 - 37:45)
it's funny uh i i got hired through the (37:43 - 37:46)
entertainment (37:45 - 37:49)
section of the site uh which is which is (37:46 - 37:51)
generally just movies tv and comics (37:49 - 37:53)
um and then we have another office where (37:51 - 37:54)
there's video games (37:53 - 37:57)
but i'm a frequent guest uh at the (37:54 - 37:58)
game's office (37:57 - 37:59)
um and actually now we're merged and (37:58 - 38:01)
we're one big office but the games folks (37:59 - 38:02)
know me because they're like okay (38:01 - 38:07)
uh pokemon guy he's here again (38:02 - 38:09)
i i wanna dive in deep with all the (38:07 - 38:11)
pokemon stuff but because (38:09 - 38:13)
we brought up ign because sword and (38:11 - 38:15)
shield was so controversial (38:13 - 38:17)
at the time feel like it still is uh how (38:15 - 38:18)
was the whole (38:17 - 38:22)
national dex stuff for you guys (38:18 - 38:25)
where there was an obvious divide in (38:22 - 38:27)
pokemon fans that were just okay with it (38:25 - 38:29)
and then fans that were not (38:27 - 38:30)
okay with the people that were okay with (38:29 - 38:33)
it yeah it was very polarizing (38:30 - 38:35)
um you know i think this the (38:33 - 38:37)
conversation had on ign was (38:35 - 38:39)
similar to what was happening elsewhere (38:37 - 38:42)
of just that some people were super (38:39 - 38:43)
passionate about it and i think yeah (38:42 - 38:46)
they're right to feel the way they feel (38:43 - 38:48)
but then some people actually are like (38:46 - 38:50)
me who who don't strive to collect every (38:48 - 38:52)
last pokemon in need every last pokemon (38:50 - 38:54)
to be present in the game (38:52 - 38:55)
and they're like oh well that's a little (38:54 - 38:58)
disappointing but i'll be fine (38:55 - 39:02)
yeah so casey at ign reviewed sword and (38:58 - 39:02)
shield (39:02 - 39:05)
yes i guess your input is not in that (39:02 - 39:07)
review so what did you think of it (39:05 - 39:09)
um yes i will just say as a disclaimer (39:07 - 39:11)
that casey defridas yeah (39:09 - 39:13)
her review is is the standing review of (39:11 - 39:15)
the site and anything i say is my own (39:13 - 39:17)
personal opinion and doesn't affect (39:15 - 39:19)
or detract from from her review or her (39:17 - 39:20)
score or anything (39:19 - 39:23)
um so i was just in love (39:20 - 39:26)
with the gallery region and all the new (39:23 - 39:27)
pokemon (39:26 - 39:29)
and i'm someone who didn't look at any (39:27 - 39:30)
of the spoilers and i just want to go in (39:29 - 39:31)
and play it for (39:30 - 39:33)
and experience everything for the first (39:31 - 39:34)
time and i got such a kick (39:33 - 39:36)
out of just catching all these new (39:34 - 39:38)
pokemon and watching what they turn into (39:36 - 39:40)
i thought the creature design in this (39:38 - 39:41)
generation was fantastic (39:40 - 39:43)
as well as you know the region and (39:41 - 39:45)
everything the gym leaders uh were all (39:43 - 39:46)
awesome this time around (39:45 - 39:49)
and how they they elevated uh what a gym (39:46 - 39:50)
match could be and where it's (39:49 - 39:52)
you know a match like a sporting event (39:50 - 39:53)
in front of a huge crowd (39:52 - 39:56)
love that uh that music that comes in i (39:53 - 39:57)
won't try and sing it but you know the (39:56 - 39:59)
chanting the dynamics chant (39:57 - 40:01)
that's good oh man so good so i i loved (39:59 - 40:02)
all those things about it (40:01 - 40:05)
uh the one thing i just really don't (40:02 - 40:06)
like and you'll (40:05 - 40:08)
if if people do follow me on twitter (40:06 - 40:10)
they know this already is that i just (40:08 - 40:10)
wish (40:10 - 40:13)
the games were more challenging again (40:10 - 40:16)
like like give me just like the gen five (40:13 - 40:17)
level of difficulty (40:16 - 40:20)
and i'd be happy but yeah uh the games (40:17 - 40:21)
they're you know they're (40:20 - 40:25)
um they're made for i think you know (40:21 - 40:28)
children uh and uh uh that's like their (40:25 - 40:28)
target (40:28 - 40:30)
audience and to please them i think they (40:28 - 40:32)
took away a lot of the the friction and (40:30 - 40:33)
resistance and (40:32 - 40:35)
and the you know the ability to fail um (40:33 - 40:36)
but i think you need that i think you (40:35 - 40:38)
need that in pokemon right that's like (40:36 - 40:39)
ash ketchum's like biggest lesson (40:38 - 40:42)
is that uh uh you can still have a good (40:39 - 40:44)
time and make friends (40:42 - 40:46)
um despite the fact that uh you didn't (40:44 - 40:48)
win the pokemon championship until (40:46 - 40:53)
uh um alola (40:48 - 40:54)
do you watch the do you follow the anime (40:53 - 40:56)
or is that just the (40:54 - 40:58)
i mean everyone knows that he won (40:56 - 41:00)
whether they watched it or not (40:58 - 41:04)
um i watch it uh intermittently like (41:00 - 41:05)
i'll like tune in (41:04 - 41:08)
and watch a big chunk of a season and (41:05 - 41:08)
then kind of (41:08 - 41:10)
fade away and then i'll come back when (41:08 - 41:12)
something catches my attention (41:10 - 41:14)
um you know i did watch of course the (41:12 - 41:15)
show when i (41:14 - 41:17)
grew up uh from from the start but then (41:15 - 41:18)
trailed off (41:17 - 41:21)
around the time the the the the gs ball (41:18 - 41:24)
mystery i was like where's the payoff (41:21 - 41:26)
uh but then yeah i've come back you know (41:24 - 41:27)
it's uh the uh (41:26 - 41:30)
the one where uh is it pokemon journeys (41:27 - 41:31)
that is that the netflix one yes (41:30 - 41:33)
yep um i thought that was was really (41:31 - 41:34)
cool and then the pokemon (41:33 - 41:37)
twilight wings which is the online mini (41:34 - 41:37)
series (41:37 - 41:40)
i thought that was so good i wish the (41:37 - 41:41)
main series would (41:40 - 41:43)
um you know borrow from that mention (41:41 - 41:44)
that you grew up (41:43 - 41:46)
playing pokemon so did that always stick (41:44 - 41:48)
with you did you (41:46 - 41:50)
i'm not sure like what was the first (41:48 - 41:51)
game you played i guess (41:50 - 41:53)
but pokemon red and my brother got (41:51 - 41:54)
pokemon blue and (41:53 - 41:57)
it just like ash ketchum was like uh up (41:54 - 41:58)
late (41:57 - 42:00)
the night before trying to decide what a (41:58 - 42:02)
starter was gonna be i had that same (42:00 - 42:05)
you know crisis very relatable ash uh (42:02 - 42:07)
yeah i ended up i ended up going with (42:05 - 42:08)
bulbasaur (42:07 - 42:11)
um and uh had a great time with that (42:08 - 42:11)
game (42:11 - 42:14)
yeah and then but i played that game (42:11 - 42:16)
like to death (42:14 - 42:19)
um and um that was like before all the (42:16 - 42:22)
free-to-play games and 800 games coming (42:19 - 42:23)
out a day you got (42:22 - 42:25)
you got one game as a kid and that was (42:23 - 42:27)
you got that until like christmas so you (42:25 - 42:28)
play (42:27 - 42:29)
yeah and if you wanted to play with (42:28 - 42:31)
somebody else you had to link (42:29 - 42:33)
your game boy to theirs with a link (42:31 - 42:35)
cable remember that and you had that's (42:33 - 42:36)
the only way you could do multiplayer (42:35 - 42:37)
like (42:36 - 42:39)
battle somebody else or to trade yeah my (42:37 - 42:41)
parents refused to buy me a link cable (42:39 - 42:42)
because (42:41 - 42:44)
what because they thought it was a waste (42:42 - 42:45)
of money because what (42:44 - 42:46)
was it what was the game back then like (42:45 - 42:49)
30 maybe 35 bucks and a link cable was (42:46 - 42:51)
like 15 half the cost of a game so they (42:49 - 42:51)
were like yeah (42:51 - 42:54)
your friends have the link cables we (42:51 - 42:54)
don't need you (42:54 - 42:58)
to have one that's fantastic (42:54 - 43:00)
that's funny i actually have a funny (42:58 - 43:02)
story about link cables (43:00 - 43:04)
so uh maybe you don't know about this (43:02 - 43:05)
because you didn't have one but there (43:04 - 43:07)
was this trick where you could trade (43:05 - 43:10)
a pokemon from one game to another and (43:07 - 43:10)
yank out (43:10 - 43:12)
the link cable at the right moment and (43:10 - 43:14)
it would clone the pokemon you know what (43:12 - 43:15)
i'm talking about yeah that's how i got (43:14 - 43:16)
my mew (43:15 - 43:20)
right they wouldn't take me to toys r us (43:16 - 43:23)
so my friend he gave me a mew and then (43:20 - 43:25)
uh because he cloned it and then or (43:23 - 43:27)
maybe he got it from like a game shark (43:25 - 43:27)
or whatever (43:27 - 43:30)
uh the equivalent for that was um but uh (43:27 - 43:31)
i remember (43:30 - 43:34)
uh getting a little power hungry and (43:31 - 43:35)
cloning not just the mew but like (43:34 - 43:36)
mewtwo's and (43:35 - 43:39)
and you know uh all the starters and (43:36 - 43:41)
everything and i was like oh yes i have (43:39 - 43:43)
all these pokemon i'm so i'm so strong (43:41 - 43:44)
now (43:43 - 43:46)
and then i just i did uh it one more (43:44 - 43:47)
time (43:46 - 43:49)
and then when i turned the game back on (43:47 - 43:50)
the uh (43:49 - 43:53)
all my memory had gone away and it had (43:50 - 43:54)
it had been factory reset (43:53 - 43:57)
my save file with all 151 pokemon and (43:54 - 43:58)
all my powerful clones (43:57 - 44:01)
were gone that was the life back then (43:58 - 44:04)
um but twist uh i called pokemon (44:01 - 44:07)
customer service completely upset (44:04 - 44:10)
and uh they sent me a new cartridge with (44:07 - 44:12)
all 150 pokemon on that (44:10 - 44:15)
best customer service experience of my (44:12 - 44:17)
life it sounds like a playground story (44:15 - 44:20)
no i swear i swear and i i still have it (44:17 - 44:21)
to this day in like a bin (44:20 - 44:23)
somewhere but the thing that that bugged (44:21 - 44:24)
me is uh (44:23 - 44:26)
they i think they just have a bunch of (44:24 - 44:28)
cartridges with the game complete just (44:26 - 44:29)
lying around or something (44:28 - 44:33)
um because the player name was dragon (44:29 - 44:34)
and that always bothered me because i'm (44:33 - 44:36)
like my name's not dragon why would you (44:34 - 44:37)
name yourself dragon (44:36 - 44:38)
my name's joshua (44:37 - 44:40)
[Laughter] (44:38 - 44:42)
that definitely sounds like something (44:40 - 44:43)
you would hear like on the playground (44:42 - 44:45)
though of like a 10 year old being like (44:43 - 44:46)
oh i called nintendo and they sent me a (44:45 - 44:48)
new copy (44:46 - 44:51)
you know the funny part is is that uh (44:48 - 44:53)
they didn't tell me they were gonna send (44:51 - 44:54)
me the game they just heard my story and (44:53 - 44:56)
said let me talk to your dad and i was (44:54 - 44:57)
like uh okay (44:56 - 44:58)
and so then my dad didn't tell me what's (44:57 - 45:00)
gonna happen so it just arrived one day (44:58 - 45:01)
in the mail and i was like losing my (45:00 - 45:04)
mind i was like oh my god (45:01 - 45:06)
growing up did you have the pokemon (45:04 - 45:08)
fallout where you got teased made fun of (45:06 - 45:10)
pokemon not cool (45:08 - 45:12)
you had to like keep your secret no uh (45:10 - 45:13)
away from people (45:12 - 45:15)
because that was like that was like me (45:13 - 45:17)
with gen 3. i just i had to skip it (45:15 - 45:18)
because i was in middle school at that (45:17 - 45:19)
point and if you (45:18 - 45:21)
if you were playing pokemon i was (45:19 - 45:22)
already uncool but playing pokemon put (45:21 - 45:25)
me even more uncool (45:22 - 45:27)
i feel that uh so gen 3 is like your (45:25 - 45:28)
lost generation (45:27 - 45:30)
yeah i mean to this day i've gone back (45:28 - 45:32)
to it but that was the one i that was (45:30 - 45:34)
the one i completely skipped (45:32 - 45:37)
uh at the time yeah i think i was age (45:34 - 45:38)
appropriate i think i was in middle (45:37 - 45:38)
school (45:38 - 45:40)
so it was it was fine that i was into (45:38 - 45:42)
pokemon and all my friends were (45:40 - 45:43)
too actually i didn't have many friends (45:42 - 45:45)
but all the other kids were uh (45:43 - 45:48)
you know into pokemon and uh but it got (45:45 - 45:49)
to the point (45:48 - 45:52)
where it did at a lot of places where it (45:49 - 45:53)
was just so crazy (45:52 - 45:55)
that it had to be banned from the school (45:53 - 45:58)
um and i remember somebody stole (45:55 - 46:00)
a zapdos out of my binder it was just (45:58 - 46:02)
there one second was gone the next and i (46:00 - 46:05)
i i oh yeah i it was a bad day for (46:02 - 46:07)
joshua for young joshua (46:05 - 46:09)
um but i actually skipped some a lot of (46:07 - 46:11)
generations because i played the first (46:09 - 46:11)
like (46:11 - 46:13)
couple games and then just kind of moved (46:11 - 46:15)
on to other stuff (46:13 - 46:17)
and so uh it wasn't until i think like (46:15 - 46:20)
college or or a couple years after (46:17 - 46:22)
that i just randomly decided to pick up (46:20 - 46:23)
a black (46:22 - 46:26)
two for some reason okay i don't know i (46:23 - 46:27)
just started (46:26 - 46:29)
a weird one to start with i didn't even (46:27 - 46:30)
start with like (46:29 - 46:32)
black one and white one i just went (46:30 - 46:33)
right into that one and that kind of (46:32 - 46:35)
reignited pokemon for me but yeah so i (46:33 - 46:36)
have (46:35 - 46:37)
i missed some some middle generations (46:36 - 46:39)
there for sure (46:37 - 46:42)
and what about uh what about pokemon go (46:39 - 46:42)
i mean (46:42 - 46:45)
everyone played at the the week it came (46:42 - 46:46)
out the month (46:45 - 46:49)
it came out really um but did that (46:46 - 46:50)
capture your interest are you still (46:49 - 46:50)
playing it (46:50 - 46:53)
i mean oh yeah that took over my life uh (46:50 - 46:56)
when it came out and for a long time (46:53 - 46:56)
after that (46:56 - 46:58)
but it's uh it's again something that (46:56 - 47:00)
i'll put to the side (46:58 - 47:01)
for a while but then something will (47:00 - 47:03)
inevitably like draw me back in (47:01 - 47:05)
and uh i'll get playing again i'll get (47:03 - 47:07)
re-obsessed and i'll have to like try (47:05 - 47:09)
and catch up on all the things i missed (47:07 - 47:10)
and everything (47:09 - 47:11)
but actually when you put it down for a (47:10 - 47:13)
while it's actually a little bit more (47:11 - 47:15)
fun when you come back because (47:13 - 47:17)
everything is new and you're constantly (47:15 - 47:18)
getting like new stuff that's really fun (47:17 - 47:19)
and cool (47:18 - 47:21)
um or you're getting things that were (47:19 - 47:23)
really rare and scarce and valuable (47:21 - 47:26)
um before you know like maybe months (47:23 - 47:27)
earlier or even a year earlier (47:26 - 47:30)
um so that's a small little benefit but (47:27 - 47:32)
yeah i love pokemon go (47:30 - 47:35)
you reviewed the detective pikachu movie (47:32 - 47:38)
i did for ign has has your thoughts or (47:35 - 47:40)
stance changed on that movie since sorry (47:38 - 47:41)
we're jumping around (47:40 - 47:43)
i'm just looking through my list of (47:41 - 47:44)
questions i was like how am i gonna fit (47:43 - 47:47)
in the detective pikachu (47:44 - 47:48)
this one will be good it's been over a (47:47 - 47:50)
year now since that movie came out (47:48 - 47:52)
yeah you know what i uh i love that (47:50 - 47:54)
movie um (47:52 - 47:56)
uh the the plot kind of goes off the (47:54 - 47:58)
rails and it gets a little too confusing (47:56 - 48:00)
like i still to this day could not (47:58 - 48:02)
explain like what the whole like motive (48:00 - 48:04)
of like mewtwo and the plan was and (48:02 - 48:05)
everything there (48:04 - 48:07)
uh but (48:05 - 48:07)
[Laughter] (48:09 - 48:13)
but just that it brought pokemon to life (48:10 - 48:14)
in such (48:13 - 48:17)
uh vivid authentic um (48:14 - 48:21)
uh detail was just it meant the world to (48:17 - 48:23)
me and just all the pokemon felt so (48:21 - 48:24)
real and they were acting like (48:23 - 48:26)
appropriately and had like the right (48:24 - 48:28)
like personalities and everything and (48:26 - 48:31)
uh just that it got the world of pokemon (48:28 - 48:34)
uh correctly and my favorite moment is (48:31 - 48:34)
when they go (48:34 - 48:36)
and pikachu gets hurt and they go into (48:34 - 48:38)
the forest and the bulbasaur are there (48:36 - 48:39)
that's like straight out of like a (48:38 - 48:41)
miyazaki movie right like that (48:39 - 48:43)
is just like this wonderful beautiful (48:41 - 48:45)
pokemon experience (48:43 - 48:47)
and they they really uh got it right (48:45 - 48:48)
besides the (48:47 - 48:51)
the plot uh i just loved everything (48:48 - 48:52)
about that movie and the plot demon (48:51 - 48:54)
matter i was like i'm looking (48:52 - 48:55)
as long as there's a new pokemon every (48:54 - 48:58)
like one minute i'm good (48:55 - 49:01)
uh yes they certainly had that um but i (48:58 - 49:02)
actually got to visit (49:01 - 49:05)
the set of um detective pikachu when (49:02 - 49:06)
they were filming it (49:05 - 49:09)
and uh that was (49:06 - 49:12)
like a life-changing experience that was (49:09 - 49:13)
spectacular (49:12 - 49:16)
um it was the scene where they go to the (49:13 - 49:18)
underground fight club when pikachu (49:16 - 49:19)
fights charizard (49:18 - 49:22)
oh yeah so we got to walk out onto (49:19 - 49:24)
like the battle arena so walking on to (49:22 - 49:27)
like a life-size full battle arena (49:24 - 49:29)
uh where you know the the lines are (49:27 - 49:31)
painted on the ground for the pokemon (49:29 - 49:33)
uh you know you know there's like a (49:31 - 49:35)
circle in the middle and the trainer (49:33 - 49:36)
boxes on either side (49:35 - 49:39)
um and then there's like uh like claw (49:36 - 49:41)
marks and scratches and burns like (49:39 - 49:43)
on on the pavement like it's been worn (49:41 - 49:45)
like it's been used a lot and seen a lot (49:43 - 49:46)
of pokemon battles (49:45 - 49:48)
um all these pokemon trainers and and (49:46 - 49:49)
just viewers (49:48 - 49:51)
um you know uh in in the on the (49:49 - 49:53)
outskirts behind the the cage in like (49:51 - 49:54)
pokemon fashions (49:53 - 49:56)
they each had sort of like a glowing (49:54 - 49:58)
like diode like a little like wire (49:56 - 50:00)
attached to them and that's where their (49:58 - 50:01)
pokemon would be would be that's like (50:00 - 50:03)
the tracker for their pokemon (50:01 - 50:06)
um and then the for the fight uh they (50:03 - 50:06)
had (50:06 - 50:09)
two people holding up parts of a (50:06 - 50:10)
charizard one had (50:09 - 50:13)
the head and one had i don't know (50:10 - 50:14)
another part like it was like i think it (50:13 - 50:15)
was the tail (50:14 - 50:17)
um and they were in green screen suits (50:15 - 50:18)
and they were running around (50:17 - 50:20)
you know doing charizard's movement at (50:18 - 50:22)
just like a placeholder for where he (50:20 - 50:23)
would be then another guy was on the (50:22 - 50:24)
floor (50:23 - 50:26)
holding pikachu and then ryan reynolds (50:24 - 50:27)
was not there but they were playing his (50:26 - 50:28)
lines (50:27 - 50:30)
over the loudspeaker and he was like (50:28 - 50:31)
acting out where the pikachu was (50:30 - 50:33)
and then they had the live-action actor (50:31 - 50:35)
um (50:33 - 50:37)
justice smith there among all this i'm (50:35 - 50:38)
sure he felt (50:37 - 50:39)
really silly just playing around with (50:38 - 50:41)
these guys in green screen suits and (50:39 - 50:42)
holding pokemon (50:41 - 50:45)
uh body parts uh but it was the coolest (50:42 - 50:45)
thing (50:45 - 50:47)
if you didn't work at ign i would be (50:45 - 50:48)
like no that's another (50:47 - 50:51)
playground story that you're telling me (50:48 - 50:52)
and that you're lying to me (50:51 - 50:55)
uh you know what uh yeah you said (50:52 - 50:57)
earlier that like you weren't cool and i (50:55 - 50:59)
i feel that you know uh but i think (50:57 - 51:00)
you're awesome man (50:59 - 51:03)
um but like i'm not a cool person but (51:00 - 51:05)
i've had a lot of cool things happen to (51:03 - 51:05)
me (51:05 - 51:08)
uh thanks to my job you know at ign uh (51:05 - 51:09)
so (51:08 - 51:11)
just my thing is just sharing those cool (51:09 - 51:12)
experiences uh (51:11 - 51:14)
with with with all the people so you (51:12 - 51:16)
said earlier that you get to pick kind (51:14 - 51:18)
choose kind of what you want to write (51:16 - 51:20)
about and i believe how i discovered you (51:18 - 51:21)
is you were posting (51:20 - 51:25)
like more tcg stuff and (51:21 - 51:28)
pokemon tcg stuff and i don't think (51:25 - 51:30)
until recently i feel like ign has ever (51:28 - 51:33)
really covered the pokemon trading card (51:30 - 51:33)
game (51:33 - 51:36)
i mean i would assume that part of it is (51:33 - 51:38)
because you genuinely like it but (51:36 - 51:38)
another part is (51:38 - 51:40)
i'm assuming it's also getting clicks (51:38 - 51:42)
otherwise you probably would have (51:40 - 51:44)
stopped reporting on it if it wasn't (51:42 - 51:47)
gaining any traffic but is that is that (51:44 - 51:49)
pretty much the process of like hey i (51:47 - 51:50)
think that if we report (51:49 - 51:52)
on darkness ablaze that people are going (51:50 - 51:54)
to come to the website and check it out (51:52 - 51:56)
it's kind of a mix of everything you (51:54 - 51:57)
just said right (51:56 - 52:00)
um uh it's (51:57 - 52:02)
in terms this is a really long (52:00 - 52:03)
conversation that uh (52:02 - 52:07)
but the the the short version is um if i (52:03 - 52:08)
think something is cool (52:07 - 52:12)
and interesting i generally have just (52:08 - 52:15)
uh full freedom to write about it um or (52:12 - 52:17)
make a video about it or or do something (52:15 - 52:18)
with it and you know cover it for the (52:17 - 52:19)
site (52:18 - 52:23)
um and uh i'm they just trust me to use (52:19 - 52:23)
my (52:23 - 52:26)
good judgment and good taste that uh i (52:23 - 52:28)
won't like waste their time (52:26 - 52:32)
or anything or do something silly um (52:28 - 52:36)
but uh but yeah so i (52:32 - 52:38)
just love love love love the pokemon (52:36 - 52:40)
card game it's like my favorite (52:38 - 52:43)
aspect of the pokemon franchise and (52:40 - 52:46)
um uh so i just you know (52:43 - 52:49)
i remember when i first kind of got into (52:46 - 52:50)
it (52:49 - 52:52)
and as an adult because i played as a (52:50 - 52:53)
kid and then like i said i kind of (52:52 - 52:54)
stopped playing pokemon (52:53 - 52:56)
but then a few years ago i was actually (52:54 - 52:57)
hanging out with some friends and they (52:56 - 52:58)
were all into playing (52:57 - 53:01)
magic the gathering and i was like yeah (52:58 - 53:02)
i appreciate this is (53:01 - 53:04)
like a really well designed game but (53:02 - 53:05)
it's not for me like i want to play (53:04 - 53:09)
like my card game and uh so i i went (53:05 - 53:11)
with a friend and we bought some pokemon (53:09 - 53:12)
starter decks (53:11 - 53:15)
and uh it all begins and yep and then it (53:12 - 53:17)
got me i was right back in it and i was (53:15 - 53:19)
obsessed and i was like building meta (53:17 - 53:20)
decks like a week later (53:19 - 53:24)
um but uh when that you know that rush (53:20 - 53:25)
came to me i decided because i was (53:24 - 53:27)
passionate about it then i went to write (53:25 - 53:29)
uh about it for the site not knowing how (53:27 - 53:30)
it would do it's just kind of a test (53:29 - 53:33)
it actually did like impressively well (53:30 - 53:33)
um (53:33 - 53:36)
and uh and from then on i just continued (53:33 - 53:37)
to (53:36 - 53:40)
uh sparingly write about the pokemon (53:37 - 53:40)
trading card game (53:40 - 53:42)
it's not like a major beat for us right (53:40 - 53:44)
um but i generally (53:42 - 53:46)
wait until there is something cool fun (53:44 - 53:47)
or interesting (53:46 - 53:49)
that happens in the card game that i (53:47 - 53:51)
think maybe a more general fan of (53:49 - 53:52)
pokemon or just of (53:51 - 53:54)
you know nerd culture in general would (53:52 - 53:56)
find interesting sometimes it's that you (53:54 - 53:57)
know there was a (53:56 - 53:59)
charizard gx like the shiny charizard (53:57 - 54:00)
card (53:59 - 54:02)
um that sold for like over ten thousand (54:00 - 54:03)
dollars who doesn't want to hear about (54:02 - 54:05)
that right yeah (54:03 - 54:07)
uh stuff like that or if um you know i (54:05 - 54:08)
have an article (54:07 - 54:11)
going up about how um there's a (54:08 - 54:13)
i think the way i phrased it was like (54:11 - 54:15)
this bundle b can kill god (54:13 - 54:17)
and it's like it's just a a a bundle b (54:15 - 54:18)
card (54:17 - 54:20)
that when you know it when it meets the (54:18 - 54:21)
the mad party (54:20 - 54:23)
uh criteria of having enough pokemon in (54:21 - 54:25)
the discard pile with the mad party (54:23 - 54:27)
attack it can do 300 damage which is (54:25 - 54:28)
enough to knock out (54:27 - 54:31)
the uh arceus dialga and palkia card (54:28 - 54:35)
oh yeah it has 280 so that's just my way (54:31 - 54:36)
of just (54:35 - 54:38)
trying to make things relatable for (54:36 - 54:40)
people or to make them turn their head (54:38 - 54:41)
and go wait what i want to learn more (54:40 - 54:42)
about that (54:41 - 54:44)
and then i've tricked them into reading (54:42 - 54:44)
a deck profile (54:44 - 54:47)
[Laughter] (54:44 - 54:48)
and then they're on amazon adding (54:47 - 54:51)
booster packs to the cart (54:48 - 54:53)
you're super into marvel star wars (54:51 - 54:55)
pokemon that's (54:53 - 54:57)
that's the that's a lot of very (54:55 - 54:58)
passionate and very (54:57 - 55:02)
i would i would say argument of it argue (54:58 - 55:05)
fans i like to argue is that is that not (55:02 - 55:07)
exhausting for you well i don't usually (55:05 - 55:07)
get (55:07 - 55:10)
into the arguments because i just like (55:07 - 55:12)
to talk about what i love (55:10 - 55:14)
about these things and i don't choose (55:12 - 55:16)
sides like some people are like (55:14 - 55:19)
only marvel or only dc i'm like why not (55:16 - 55:22)
both like they're both like so good and (55:19 - 55:24)
sure there are things that i like (55:22 - 55:26)
about one and not the other and you know (55:24 - 55:27)
and vice versa but that's that's the (55:26 - 55:28)
same with anything (55:27 - 55:30)
and uh i would rather just have more (55:28 - 55:32)
good stuff (55:30 - 55:35)
than try and like choose sides and argue (55:32 - 55:36)
with people (55:35 - 55:38)
on the internet which is like the most (55:36 - 55:39)
pointless thing ever (55:38 - 55:41)
um and yeah and just have a good time (55:39 - 55:43)
and just share my love and enthusiasm (55:41 - 55:44)
for things (55:43 - 55:47)
um rather than anything else i feel like (55:44 - 55:47)
this is (55:47 - 55:49)
maybe a relatively new thing on the (55:47 - 55:51)
internet well new being maybe in the (55:49 - 55:52)
last two years (55:51 - 55:55)
of just you guys or (55:52 - 55:59)
other outlets reviewing a game and then (55:55 - 56:01)
it just getting review bombed on amazon (55:59 - 56:03)
or metacritic and stuff (56:01 - 56:05)
even even a game that just came out fall (56:03 - 56:07)
guys got review bombed because (56:05 - 56:10)
the servers weren't working yeah yeah (56:07 - 56:11)
i i guess the answer is it's not going (56:10 - 56:13)
to affect you guys and your what you do (56:11 - 56:15)
at your job but i'm sure that is (56:13 - 56:17)
something talked about or looked at or (56:15 - 56:19)
is at least covered (56:17 - 56:21)
uh in the news of like this is not a (56:19 - 56:23)
good solution to these people's problems (56:21 - 56:24)
is (56:23 - 56:27)
giving it one star on amazon or maybe it (56:24 - 56:28)
is i don't know maybe it works i (56:27 - 56:30)
can't it didn't work for sword and (56:28 - 56:32)
shield the game sold 18 million despite (56:30 - 56:33)
being (56:32 - 56:35)
review bombed on both amazon and (56:33 - 56:37)
metacritic yeah the whole (56:35 - 56:39)
that's a whole conversation isn't it of (56:37 - 56:41)
just i think people are just looking for (56:39 - 56:41)
an (56:41 - 56:43)
outlet when they're displeased and (56:41 - 56:45)
that's a place they know (56:43 - 56:48)
they'll be heard or at least be seen (56:45 - 56:49)
right (56:48 - 56:50)
because they know that something they (56:49 - 56:52)
can influence uh to (56:50 - 56:54)
to show their displeasure with something (56:52 - 56:56)
and uh (56:54 - 56:59)
it's such like a it's a multifaceted (56:56 - 57:02)
issue because fan feedback has never (56:59 - 57:03)
been more instant (57:02 - 57:05)
and never had a bigger impact and (57:03 - 57:07)
sometimes it's people being trolls (57:05 - 57:09)
and people being jerks and it's very (57:07 - 57:11)
toxic um but sometimes (57:09 - 57:14)
uh you could argue that it's good uh (57:11 - 57:16)
like sonic the hedgehog people (57:14 - 57:18)
were very clear that they're like no (57:16 - 57:20)
that's not sonic that's nightmare fuel (57:18 - 57:23)
and uh yeah and then uh now sonic uh (57:20 - 57:27)
after the redesign um is uh (57:23 - 57:30)
i think the most profitable uh video (57:27 - 57:30)
game movie (57:30 - 57:33)
ever right and uh so really worked out (57:30 - 57:35)
for them because they listen to fan (57:33 - 57:35)
feedback but i (57:35 - 57:38)
i do think there is a balance uh that (57:35 - 57:39)
needs to be struck (57:38 - 57:41)
i don't know if we will ever get there (57:39 - 57:42)
um but (57:41 - 57:45)
it is very difficult um uh especially (57:42 - 57:46)
because (57:45 - 57:50)
uh i think when one kind of studio gives (57:46 - 57:51)
in to the fan demand (57:50 - 57:54)
you then have a sense of entitlement uh (57:51 - 57:54)
to (57:54 - 57:56)
for people who are thinking okay well (57:54 - 57:58)
well they listen and they got what they (57:56 - 58:00)
want so now i'm gonna get what i want (57:58 - 58:02)
and uh and it's sort of like it's very (58:00 - 58:05)
childish right so i think if people were (58:02 - 58:06)
a little more reasonable about it and (58:05 - 58:08)
didn't just you know take out their (58:06 - 58:08)
anger (58:08 - 58:10)
on a property or a game by review (58:08 - 58:12)
bombing it i think we'd all be (58:10 - 58:15)
you know a little uh we'd all be a (58:12 - 58:17)
little less stressed um (58:15 - 58:20)
uh but i do see online that uh (58:17 - 58:23)
you know uh i i'm not sure which (58:20 - 58:26)
outlet it is is it was it metacritic or (58:23 - 58:28)
one of one of one of the you know review (58:26 - 58:30)
aggregates i think it's not a critic (58:28 - 58:33)
uh well they added a 24-hour window (58:30 - 58:34)
where you couldn't (58:33 - 58:36)
uh you had to wait before and play the (58:34 - 58:38)
game or watch the movie or whatever (58:36 - 58:40)
uh before you got a chance to actually (58:38 - 58:42)
review it and that was in an effort (58:40 - 58:46)
to uh not have those knee-jerk reaction (58:42 - 58:49)
review bombs yeah so i think things (58:46 - 58:50)
doing things like that is a it's a good (58:49 - 58:51)
solution (58:50 - 58:54)
like you know uh most people get angry (58:51 - 58:55)
in a moment (58:54 - 58:58)
and then it passes so i think if you (58:55 - 59:00)
don't give them the ability to review (58:58 - 59:01)
bomb something in the moment (59:00 - 59:04)
maybe maybe that is uh a good solution i (59:01 - 59:06)
don't really know the results of that (59:04 - 59:08)
that test they did with that but i think (59:06 - 59:09)
i think that's a step in the right (59:08 - 59:09)
direction (59:09 - 59:11)
of some people don't have any chill so (59:09 - 59:13)
you have to like you know enforce a (59:11 - 59:14)
little chill (59:13 - 59:18)
yeah do you do you guys i'm assuming (59:14 - 59:20)
i don't i can't say the last time i've (59:18 - 59:22)
looked at ign comments but i'm just i'm (59:20 - 59:24)
assuming you guys still have people (59:22 - 59:26)
upset about just a number and didn't (59:24 - 59:27)
read the review (59:26 - 59:28)
yeah i mean there's always going to be (59:27 - 59:31)
people like that but no we do talk a lot (59:28 - 59:34)
about reviews and how they're um (59:31 - 59:37)
what you know like did we get across (59:34 - 59:38)
what we wanted to (59:37 - 59:41)
is as you know you know uh what does the (59:38 - 59:42)
number mean (59:41 - 59:46)
uh we've we've uh actually recently (59:42 - 59:48)
uh gone from having a 100 point scale (59:46 - 59:50)
which is where you have like a decimal (59:48 - 59:51)
point where something could be like i (59:50 - 59:52)
gave this a (59:51 - 59:55)
5.2 or 7.9 and now we're doing a (59:52 - 59:56)
10-point scale where (59:55 - 59:58)
it's all just a whole numbers where you (59:56 - 59:59)
get it gets a seven (59:58 - 60:02)
an eight a nine a ten and it's just like (59:59 - 60:04)
that because we found that people were (60:02 - 60:06)
really focusing on those decimal points (60:04 - 60:07)
and they were like going to like another (60:06 - 60:09)
game they got like a 7.3 (60:07 - 60:10)
and like well this game got a 7.1 but (60:09 - 60:12)
how could you and it's like they were (60:10 - 60:14)
they were focusing on the number too (60:12 - 60:16)
much so by making the numbers (60:14 - 60:19)
less uh granular and making them whole (60:16 - 60:19)
numbers (60:19 - 60:22)
um the idea was it would move the (60:19 - 60:23)
conversation off the number (60:22 - 60:24)
and back onto the game which is the (60:23 - 60:26)
whole reason we write a review in the (60:24 - 60:27)
first place (60:26 - 60:29)
um and i do commend other outlets that (60:27 - 60:30)
have uh (60:29 - 60:32)
um just done away with numbers at all (60:30 - 60:34)
but when you do that you don't wind up (60:32 - 60:36)
on sites like the review aggregates and (60:34 - 60:37)
your (60:36 - 60:39)
your review reaches less people um yeah (60:37 - 60:41)
so i think that's another reason (60:39 - 60:43)
in favor of keeping the numbers there (60:41 - 60:44)
but yeah i mean (60:43 - 60:47)
reviews will always be a uh (60:44 - 60:50)
a hot topic uh you know no matter where (60:47 - 60:51)
you are (60:50 - 60:53)
uh on the internet ign or elsewhere i (60:51 - 60:54)
think the uh (60:53 - 60:56)
and i i don't know maybe you guys have (60:54 - 60:57)
seen success with this i think your (60:56 - 60:58)
video reviews been (60:57 - 61:00)
great like you can scroll down you can (60:58 - 61:01)
see the number and then you go ah this (61:00 - 61:02)
is a lot of (61:01 - 61:04)
i don't want to read this but then you (61:02 - 61:05)
just press play and pretty much (61:04 - 61:08)
somebody's reading it to you (61:05 - 61:11)
uh at that point yeah i i (61:08 - 61:13)
even before i worked at ign i always (61:11 - 61:14)
loved uh (61:13 - 61:16)
the um the video reviews just because (61:14 - 61:17)
they were so (61:16 - 61:20)
in-depth and they illustrated what they (61:17 - 61:21)
were talking about (61:20 - 61:24)
uh with the game and or with movie or tv (61:21 - 61:26)
show or whatever is being reviewed (61:24 - 61:28)
um and that i ign was always a (61:26 - 61:30)
dependable place for me to go (61:28 - 61:32)
to get a good look at a game before i (61:30 - 61:33)
went to buy it (61:32 - 61:36)
speaking of video too uh i saw you (61:33 - 61:39)
on a podcast uh right after they (61:36 - 61:41)
announced pokemon snap everyone seemed (61:39 - 61:43)
pretty pumped about that (61:41 - 61:46)
yeah i mean that's one of those games (61:43 - 61:50)
that uh for for like you know original (61:46 - 61:51)
og (61:50 - 61:54)
uh pokemon fans like like uh like you (61:51 - 61:56)
and me (61:54 - 61:59)
um that game like hit the sweet spot of (61:56 - 62:01)
of just being uh kind of like i was (61:59 - 62:02)
saying about detective pikachu of just (62:01 - 62:04)
bringing the world of pokemon to life (62:02 - 62:08)
in a really fun novel way um and i think (62:04 - 62:10)
people now who've like played pokemon go (62:08 - 62:11)
and stuff and didn't play snap would be (62:10 - 62:12)
like well what's the big deal you're (62:11 - 62:14)
just taking pictures of them i can i can (62:12 - 62:15)
put a bulbasaur (62:14 - 62:16)
in my living room and take a picture of (62:15 - 62:19)
it on the table you know pokemon go (62:16 - 62:21)
but no there it was it wasn't just (62:19 - 62:23)
taking pictures right it was like (62:21 - 62:25)
uh it was a puzzle game it was on a (62:23 - 62:27)
timer right and so and you had to like (62:25 - 62:30)
do things in a certain uh order and and (62:27 - 62:32)
and beat the timer because you know if (62:30 - 62:34)
you took too long throwing your apples (62:32 - 62:36)
at the you know the charmeleon uh you (62:34 - 62:38)
missed the photo of charizard right so (62:36 - 62:40)
you there was there's all these things (62:38 - 62:41)
you had to learn and unlock about this (62:40 - 62:42)
game (62:41 - 62:44)
and it rewarded playing you know (62:42 - 62:46)
replaying it over and over again (62:44 - 62:48)
uh and then of course there was that (62:46 - 62:49)
that beautiful (62:48 - 62:52)
uh psychedelic space level where you (62:49 - 62:53)
could get (62:52 - 62:56)
a perfect 10 000 point picture of mew at (62:53 - 62:57)
the end that's just like (62:56 - 63:00)
that's the dream right for pokemon fans (62:57 - 63:01)
like that's just like it just (63:00 - 63:03)
encapsulates the pokemon experience (63:01 - 63:05)
um in a way that's that's not the (63:03 - 63:07)
traditional pokemon formula of like (63:05 - 63:08)
catching and battling (63:07 - 63:10)
uh but it's still just awesome just as (63:08 - 63:11)
awesome so i think (63:10 - 63:13)
yeah there's a lot of hype for for new (63:11 - 63:16)
pokemon snap and i can't wait to play it (63:13 - 63:18)
i think it has uh (63:16 - 63:21)
big shoes to fill with i think uh in in (63:18 - 63:22)
the original (63:21 - 63:23)
it was it was relatively short although (63:22 - 63:25)
as a kid it would probably (63:23 - 63:28)
seem like the most fulfill fulfilling (63:25 - 63:30)
game ever but you know only like 63 (63:28 - 63:30)
pokemon (63:30 - 63:32)
i think like six levels and then the (63:30 - 63:34)
seventh level was that sick i never (63:32 - 63:36)
heard anyone describe it as psychedelic (63:34 - 63:38)
but yeah the psychic delic (63:36 - 63:40)
space level it's pokemon so i can't (63:38 - 63:42)
imagine they don't put a 60 (63:40 - 63:44)
price tag on it but what do you do you (63:42 - 63:46)
think there's anything they need to do (63:44 - 63:48)
like does it have to hit you know at (63:46 - 63:50)
least 500 pokemon does it have to have (63:48 - 63:52)
this amount of levels like (63:50 - 63:55)
i feel like games have such high (63:52 - 63:57)
people want so much more out of a 60 (63:55 - 63:58)
game nowadays i feel (63:57 - 64:03)
like yeah um i wouldn't be surprised if (63:58 - 64:04)
they do the thing where they're (64:03 - 64:06)
constantly adding (64:04 - 64:08)
new content it's one of those kind of (64:06 - 64:10)
games as service kind of things (64:08 - 64:12)
um they haven't said what it's going to (64:10 - 64:13)
be but i could actually see that (64:12 - 64:14)
happening (64:13 - 64:15)
like just starting with like a base (64:14 - 64:17)
adventure and then (64:15 - 64:19)
every couple months a couple times a (64:17 - 64:20)
year they uh (64:19 - 64:22)
they come out imagine that they're like (64:20 - 64:24)
oh here's an another (64:22 - 64:28)
level where we've like hidden you know (64:24 - 64:30)
50 new pokemon because you know there's (64:28 - 64:31)
over a thousand pokemon now there's (64:30 - 64:33)
plenty to get through there's no way (64:31 - 64:34)
it's all gonna be (64:33 - 64:36)
in the base game and uh uh i think it (64:34 - 64:38)
would be unrealistic for people to (64:36 - 64:39)
expect them all to be in the base game (64:38 - 64:41)
at least yeah um (64:39 - 64:43)
uh but uh but yeah i think i think that (64:41 - 64:44)
would be cool now that i'm talking about (64:43 - 64:45)
it i think it would be (64:44 - 64:47)
it would be cool i think it's it's gonna (64:45 - 64:48)
be obvious that they're gonna have like (64:47 - 64:49)
all the fan favorites in there (64:48 - 64:51)
and then a couple unexpected ones and (64:49 - 64:53)
stuff but uh (64:51 - 64:54)
but i think what it needs to have it (64:53 - 64:56)
just it does need to have that sort of (64:54 - 64:57)
element of tension (64:56 - 64:59)
where you're on like i don't want it to (64:57 - 65:01)
be like where you can um (64:59 - 65:02)
uh just go off into the wild and take (65:01 - 65:04)
pictures i actually wanted to be on (65:02 - 65:05)
rails (65:04 - 65:06)
uh because that that was part of the (65:05 - 65:08)
puzzle game right you had just (65:06 - 65:10)
it you had to stay on the path it put (65:08 - 65:11)
you on and do everything within a (65:10 - 65:13)
certain amount of time (65:11 - 65:15)
uh and that that was what was what made (65:13 - 65:16)
it fun and addicting and wanting and you (65:15 - 65:18)
wanted to like run it again and again (65:16 - 65:19)
and again (65:18 - 65:20)
until you got it right and you found (65:19 - 65:23)
everything um so i definitely want to (65:20 - 65:23)
keep (65:23 - 65:26)
that core experience uh in the game and (65:23 - 65:27)
then yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't be (65:26 - 65:30)
opposed to them just expanding the game (65:27 - 65:30)
um (65:30 - 65:32)
you know as a service it's worked for (65:30 - 65:33)
animal crossing (65:32 - 65:38)
hey is there any pokemon memory that (65:33 - 65:38)
stands out (65:38 - 65:41)
to you in the last 20 some years that (65:38 - 65:43)
that you haven't brought up i mean you (65:41 - 65:44)
got back in with (65:43 - 65:47)
gen 5 zapdos stolen on the playground (65:44 - 65:49)
[Laughter] (65:47 - 65:52)
don't bring it up um (65:49 - 65:54)
i will say that when i got back into the (65:52 - 65:56)
tcg a few years ago (65:54 - 65:59)
um i was just adamant about doing it (65:56 - 66:00)
very casually (65:59 - 66:02)
because there was like the world (66:00 - 66:03)
championship you could qualify for (66:02 - 66:05)
but i thought that was just like too (66:03 - 66:07)
much but uh (66:05 - 66:10)
last year um one of my friends actually (66:07 - 66:11)
qualified (66:10 - 66:13)
and i thought wow i was like so (66:11 - 66:15)
impressed and i was like well wait a (66:13 - 66:15)
second (66:15 - 66:19)
if he can do it i can do it so i i tried (66:15 - 66:21)
my hand at qualifying for the pokemon (66:19 - 66:22)
world championships (66:21 - 66:25)
uh uh to cut to the end of that story i (66:22 - 66:26)
did it (66:25 - 66:28)
uh and i was in march of this year or (66:26 - 66:30)
was the end of february yeah (66:28 - 66:34)
whatever the um it was like on uh (66:30 - 66:36)
was it dallas or knoxville it was the (66:34 - 66:37)
end it was like a big regional uh (66:36 - 66:39)
tournament was knoxville (66:37 - 66:41)
uh it wasn't houston uh i think i think (66:39 - 66:43)
it was in in knoxville (66:41 - 66:46)
um but uh i grew up before coveted right (66:43 - 66:48)
right it was on the on the cusp right we (66:46 - 66:50)
i think we had just heard about it (66:48 - 66:53)
and we weren't really taking any um (66:50 - 66:55)
safety precautions yet like nothing had (66:53 - 66:56)
been shut down yet (66:55 - 66:58)
i do remember not shaking my opponent's (66:56 - 66:59)
hands and just being like let's just do (66:58 - 67:00)
a fist bump just just (66:59 - 67:01)
because you know we didn't we didn't (67:00 - 67:03)
know anything about the virus at that (67:01 - 67:04)
point uh but (67:03 - 67:06)
just just for safety we'll do fist bumps (67:04 - 67:08)
uh but for in that tournament (67:06 - 67:10)
um i actually did my career best (67:08 - 67:11)
placement it (67:10 - 67:13)
had like 600 plus people but i got 10th (67:11 - 67:14)
place (67:13 - 67:16)
and that awards you a bunch of (67:14 - 67:18)
championship points and you need 500 (67:16 - 67:21)
to get a world's invite and so that put (67:18 - 67:22)
me over the threshold (67:21 - 67:24)
and so that that was like one of the (67:22 - 67:26)
happiest moments i'd had because uh (67:24 - 67:28)
it had taken like eight months of you (67:26 - 67:29)
know practicing (67:28 - 67:32)
training uh traveling to tournaments all (67:29 - 67:33)
around the us (67:32 - 67:35)
um playing in tournaments like pretty (67:33 - 67:37)
much uh every weekend or once or twice a (67:35 - 67:38)
week (67:37 - 67:40)
um and grinding trying to get those 500 (67:38 - 67:41)
points (67:40 - 67:44)
um and i live in southern california in (67:41 - 67:45)
los angeles area and it's like a super (67:44 - 67:46)
competitive (67:45 - 67:48)
area like millions of people live here (67:46 - 67:49)
and it's like some of the best pokemon (67:48 - 67:50)
players (67:49 - 67:52)
um in north america all live in my (67:50 - 67:54)
neighborhood so it's like (67:52 - 67:56)
it's really you know just to get go to a (67:54 - 67:58)
league challenge like you have to face (67:56 - 67:59)
the best of the best and that's like the (67:58 - 68:00)
lowest level tournament that's only (67:59 - 68:01)
worth 15 (68:00 - 68:04)
points um but anyways uh as i was (68:01 - 68:05)
playing (68:04 - 68:08)
um in uh these like regional tournaments (68:05 - 68:09)
which are like the big (68:08 - 68:10)
you know tournaments that have anywhere (68:09 - 68:12)
from like 500 to a thousand people (68:10 - 68:15)
i finally got uh i was like doing better (68:12 - 68:16)
like i (68:15 - 68:19)
i finished like 120th and one and then i (68:16 - 68:19)
got like (68:19 - 68:23)
110th at the next one then i got like (68:19 - 68:24)
47th place in the next one and i'm like (68:23 - 68:26)
okay and then the most recent one yeah i (68:24 - 68:27)
got 10th place (68:26 - 68:28)
and i was like wow i'm getting like (68:27 - 68:30)
better and better and now i have enough (68:28 - 68:32)
points to play in worlds like i had so (68:30 - 68:33)
much momentum and i was so happy (68:32 - 68:35)
but then of course they canceled the (68:33 - 68:37)
world championships and they postponed (68:35 - 68:39)
it until 2021 they are (68:37 - 68:41)
rolling over the invites so i will get (68:39 - 68:42)
to play um (68:41 - 68:44)
next year although there's this whole (68:42 - 68:46)
thing where they added an extra day onto (68:44 - 68:47)
the event for (68:46 - 68:50)
2020 qualifiers um and then if you had (68:47 - 68:50)
gotten (68:50 - 68:53)
the the proper amount of points for the (68:50 - 68:54)
next year (68:53 - 68:56)
then you would skip that day and go uh (68:54 - 68:58)
so it's like you kind of have to earn (68:56 - 68:59)
two invites to get (68:58 - 69:01)
a normal invite it's this whole thing (68:59 - 69:02)
anyway yeah well um (69:01 - 69:05)
hopefully things are better where there (69:02 - 69:06)
can be a worlds next year (69:05 - 69:08)
you know i have my fingers crossed so (69:06 - 69:10)
hard they're about to break (69:08 - 69:14)
but you know uh safety first you know uh (69:10 - 69:15)
i wouldn't want them to rush or do (69:14 - 69:16)
anything (69:15 - 69:18)
before you know they're ready but when (69:16 - 69:19)
you think about it (69:18 - 69:22)
will it be safe to have an international (69:19 - 69:25)
convention where the players are going (69:22 - 69:26)
to come (69:25 - 69:28)
and sit in a room together for like (69:26 - 69:29)
three days on end (69:28 - 69:32)
and uh uh you know touch each other's (69:29 - 69:33)
cards (69:32 - 69:34)
and shake each other's hands and then (69:33 - 69:37)
like go eat nachos you know like (69:34 - 69:39)
like uh will it be safe to do that a (69:37 - 69:41)
year from now i don't know i certainly (69:39 - 69:41)
hope so (69:41 - 69:45)
i hope so um but i was extra excited for (69:41 - 69:45)
worlds um (69:45 - 69:47)
not only for the chance to compete which (69:45 - 69:49)
is its own cool thing but it was going (69:47 - 69:51)
to be in uh in london and next years (69:49 - 69:52)
will be in london as well but i thought (69:51 - 69:53)
that (69:52 - 69:54)
because you know sword and shield this (69:53 - 69:56)
the gala region is based off of (69:54 - 69:58)
great britain and they were having the (69:56 - 69:59)
world's uh after (69:58 - 70:01)
sword shield in london i thought that (69:59 - 70:03)
was just too perfect and awesome (70:01 - 70:05)
um and i was very much looking forward (70:03 - 70:07)
to that but uh it didn't happen (70:05 - 70:09)
um but you know being your best memory (70:07 - 70:11)
in your worst memory (70:09 - 70:13)
it qualified but then didn't get to (70:11 - 70:14)
actually go here (70:13 - 70:16)
let me let me give you a happy memory uh (70:14 - 70:18)
just to put a cherry on the top of this (70:16 - 70:22)
um well uh i've never been like the most (70:18 - 70:23)
popular guy and don't have like a lot of (70:22 - 70:25)
friends especially since i moved to (70:23 - 70:27)
los angeles um i find it really hard to (70:25 - 70:28)
like meet (70:27 - 70:31)
and keep like good friends uh but when i (70:28 - 70:32)
started playing pokemon (70:31 - 70:34)
like the pokemon community is like super (70:32 - 70:36)
nice and awesome (70:34 - 70:38)
and uh there's everyone's just like (70:36 - 70:40)
automatically your friend because you're (70:38 - 70:41)
you're all just there to play pokemon (70:40 - 70:43)
when you show up at these tournaments (70:41 - 70:43)
and stuff (70:43 - 70:46)
so i'd like a local store that i go to (70:43 - 70:47)
and (70:46 - 70:49)
uh it was my birthday last year and i (70:47 - 70:50)
didn't (70:49 - 70:53)
um throw a birthday party for myself (70:50 - 70:54)
because i was like i don't even think i (70:53 - 70:55)
know enough people (70:54 - 70:57)
uh who would show up and like celebrate (70:55 - 70:58)
my birthday i know this is really (70:57 - 71:00)
depressing uh everyone at home sorry (70:58 - 71:04)
uh but i went to you know weekly pokemon (71:00 - 71:05)
league night (71:04 - 71:08)
uh just to play some cards and then they (71:05 - 71:08)
uh (71:08 - 71:13)
the whole um um group there (71:08 - 71:16)
surprised me and got me uh a birthday (71:13 - 71:18)
pie because they know i don't like cake (71:16 - 71:19)
and they sang me happy birthday and then (71:18 - 71:21)
some people even got me like cards is (71:19 - 71:22)
like a gift (71:21 - 71:24)
and i was so moved and i was just like (71:22 - 71:26)
that is like the power of pokemon there (71:24 - 71:27)
just everyone is just so welcoming and (71:26 - 71:29)
awesome and like (71:27 - 71:31)
and uh is would do something like that (71:29 - 71:33)
for you and i'd even ask for it and then (71:31 - 71:33)
so (71:33 - 71:36)
that is like my my really happy pokemon (71:33 - 71:36)
memory (71:36 - 71:39)
dang there was a lot in that last like (71:36 - 71:41)
five minutes (71:39 - 71:43)
it's a real emotional roller coaster (71:41 - 71:44)
have you been to a world tournament (71:43 - 71:47)
just as a spectator i have a spectator (71:44 - 71:49)
for a couple times i was covering them (71:47 - 71:50)
uh for ign (71:49 - 71:52)
oh okay okay yeah they're really they're (71:50 - 71:53)
really funny now (71:52 - 71:57)
uh i it seemed so unattainable uh which (71:53 - 71:57)
is why (71:57 - 71:59)
the memory of of getting the invite was (71:57 - 72:01)
uh you know it was so special (71:59 - 72:05)
yeah i would always i would i've been to (72:01 - 72:07)
three four uh and i've always told (72:05 - 72:08)
people if (72:07 - 72:10)
even if you can just attend and you're a (72:08 - 72:12)
pokemon fan it's it's just worth (72:10 - 72:15)
being around all those people oh yeah (72:12 - 72:16)
it's like (72:15 - 72:19)
uh pokemon's comic con or e3 you know (72:16 - 72:20)
it's like it's pretty much a big pokemon (72:19 - 72:21)
convention (72:20 - 72:23)
where people from all over the world (72:21 - 72:25)
just come in this big building (72:23 - 72:27)
and enjoy pokemon together and there's (72:25 - 72:29)
so much to do besides the competition of (72:27 - 72:31)
just hanging out there's like pokemon go (72:29 - 72:32)
events and (72:31 - 72:34)
uh you know video games there's side (72:32 - 72:36)
events and trading card game side events (72:34 - 72:37)
and little events (72:36 - 72:39)
and then usually that's when they uh (72:37 - 72:40)
take the stage (72:39 - 72:42)
and unveil new things coming up in the (72:40 - 72:44)
pokemon world like new video games (72:42 - 72:46)
sometimes they announce new pokemon (72:44 - 72:47)
uh when the movie came out that they had (72:46 - 72:49)
the detective pikachu cast come out and (72:47 - 72:50)
do like a wave (72:49 - 72:53)
uh so yeah a pokemon world championship (72:50 - 72:54)
uh (72:53 - 72:56)
is is definitely uh like a must it (72:54 - 72:57)
should be on the bucket list of every (72:56 - 72:58)
pokemon fan (72:57 - 73:00)
well i don't want to eat up too much (72:58 - 73:02)
more of your time i got one question (73:00 - 73:04)
probably probably the hardest one of the (73:02 - 73:05)
the interview (73:04 - 73:07)
uh oh what is your favorite pokemon (73:05 - 73:10)
[Laughter] (73:07 - 73:13)
um it is psyduck (73:10 - 73:15)
it's it's it's definitely psychic i have (73:13 - 73:16)
a lot of love for a lot of different (73:15 - 73:17)
pokemon (73:16 - 73:19)
but it always comes back to psyduck um (73:17 - 73:21)
because he's just (73:19 - 73:24)
really stressed out all the time (73:21 - 73:27)
and i can relate to that but no but then (73:24 - 73:29)
when he unleashes the stress when he (73:27 - 73:30)
gets once he gets focused right (73:29 - 73:33)
he does that thing where he like (73:30 - 73:34)
psychically lifts everybody into the air (73:33 - 73:36)
and like pebbles off the ground (73:34 - 73:38)
and becomes this unstoppable force once (73:36 - 73:40)
he gets his stuff together so i like i (73:38 - 73:40)
like to (73:40 - 73:42)
i think i like to think i can relate to (73:40 - 73:44)
that that's awesome (73:42 - 73:46)

[Music] (75:12 - 75:26)
slicer (75:23 - 75:26)
[Music] (75:27 - 75:34)
[Applause] (75:33 - 75:38)
and we are back uh we forgot some news (75:34 - 75:39)
really what (75:38 - 75:40)
we said we were done sorry you said we (75:39 - 75:43)
would catch up next week (75:40 - 75:45)
it's like why do you lie like this is (75:43 - 75:47)
why a pokemon company created another (75:45 - 75:48)
podcast (75:47 - 75:50)
yeah full of truths and not your (75:48 - 75:52)
alliances okay before we get (75:50 - 75:55)
to the 30 seconds of news uh number one (75:52 - 75:58)
is we were slightly mistaken last week (75:55 - 75:59)
about the podcast awards (75:58 - 76:01)
you cannot vote (75:59 - 76:03)
[Laughter] (76:01 - 76:05)
it doesn't let you vote anymore um so we (76:03 - 76:07)
did get nominated for a podcast award so (76:05 - 76:09)
thank you to everyone who voted the (76:07 - 76:11)
first time around (76:09 - 76:14)
um so from the terms of service (76:11 - 76:16)
which we still have to start a tos (76:14 - 76:18)
podcast i'm in it i'm on it (76:16 - 76:22)
500 000 people voted for different shows (76:18 - 76:25)
i i suspect 400 of the 500 000 people (76:22 - 76:27)
voted for our show but that that's (76:25 - 76:30)
cannot confirm or deny that but (76:27 - 76:32)
for the second round of voting which (76:30 - 76:34)
we're on right now that ends at the end (76:32 - 76:35)
of the month (76:34 - 76:38)
only 5 500 (76:35 - 76:42)
people from the 500 000 voters (76:38 - 76:46)
got sent an email to vote again (76:42 - 76:50)
so uh if you got that email (76:46 - 76:52)
you are allowed to vote again for our (76:50 - 76:55)
show if you did not get that email (76:52 - 76:59)
you don't get to vote for round two i (76:55 - 77:02)
don't know why they did that (76:59 - 77:05)
but that's a thing i guess (77:02 - 77:09)
so fingers crossed that (77:05 - 77:11)
things work out i guess so if you did (77:09 - 77:12)
vote (77:11 - 77:14)
check your email should say podcast (77:12 - 77:15)
awards check your junk folder (77:14 - 77:18)
you are specially selected to i'm (77:15 - 77:19)
assuming the secondary votes have more (77:18 - 77:21)
weight that would probably be my thought (77:19 - 77:22)
process (77:21 - 77:24)
well i think that votes actually have (77:22 - 77:25)
the (77:24 - 77:27)
vote right like they're the ones that (77:25 - 77:29)
are determining the award (77:27 - 77:31)
what we did was to get the top 10 (77:29 - 77:33)
choices yes (77:31 - 77:36)
so they did say there was like before (77:33 - 77:36)
means (77:36 - 77:39)
you got in and now it's these 5 000 (77:36 - 77:40)
people (77:39 - 77:42)
who are actually making the decision (77:40 - 77:43)
right plus (77:42 - 77:45)
i think there are like eight judges that (77:43 - 77:48)
are also helping with the decision (77:45 - 77:50)
so that's that uh two weeks left on our (77:48 - 77:51)
kickstarter (77:50 - 77:55)
that'll be in the show notes um (77:51 - 77:57)
oh i gotta contribute to that (77:55 - 77:58)
kickstarter is (77:57 - 78:00)
my lawyer will let me and available (77:58 - 78:02)
we'll talk about it (78:00 - 78:04)
we have images of what the uh cassettes (78:02 - 78:06)
look like now on the kickstarter (78:04 - 78:09)
and we just put up stretch goals this (78:06 - 78:11)
past week on the kickstarter (78:09 - 78:13)
um so that's all there so you got two (78:11 - 78:15)
weeks we'll remind you because next week (78:13 - 78:17)
will be the last week (78:15 - 78:20)
uh if you want to get the break music (78:17 - 78:24)
on um on cd or cassette i mean it's (78:20 - 78:26)
digital download too but uh and we're (78:24 - 78:28)
still working with the artists to (78:26 - 78:31)
um do the the books and stuff so it'll (78:28 - 78:33)
be really cool (78:31 - 78:36)
okay the news we missed coco the movie (78:33 - 78:39)
the one that's in that the one that was (78:36 - 78:40)
supposed to come out in july but didn't (78:39 - 78:41)
come out in july the (78:40 - 78:43)
the rude and the shiny celebi one and (78:41 - 78:45)
everything like that (78:43 - 78:46)
this is from brandon from our slack (78:45 - 78:50)
community comes out on christmas (78:46 - 78:54)
20 christmas day only in japan (78:50 - 78:58)
japan december 25th (78:54 - 79:00)
they said they would delay it till the (78:58 - 79:03)
winter they have decided on a date it is (79:00 - 79:06)
it is christmas in japan which i think (79:03 - 79:08)
is like a big kfc day i'll have to check (79:06 - 79:10)
with andrew pretty sure (79:08 - 79:13)
pretty sure kfc is like i remember and (79:10 - 79:14)
so andrew is a resident japanese (79:13 - 79:16)
correspondent (79:14 - 79:19)
um yep i remember him saying that like (79:16 - 79:21)
fast food restaurants will try to (79:19 - 79:24)
associate themselves with a holiday (79:21 - 79:27)
so then they like have just record sales (79:24 - 79:29)
on that specific day (79:27 - 79:33)
so kfc did that with christmas i think (79:29 - 79:35)
i mean it's not a bad idea yeah i mean (79:33 - 79:36)
kfc like (79:35 - 79:39)
didn't i don't think they deliberately (79:36 - 79:40)
associated (79:39 - 79:41)
i think that was much more of a (79:40 - 79:44)
happenstance they became associated with (79:41 - 79:44)
christmas (79:44 - 79:47)
and thus make a lot of money over (79:44 - 79:48)
christmas (79:47 - 79:50)
they also didn't they also have a final (79:48 - 79:53)
fantasy 14 promotion (79:50 - 79:57)
was that kfc ooh kfc in japan i think (79:53 - 80:00)

couldn't throw the food away otherwise (80:17 - 80:21)
you wouldn't get the chocobo (80:19 - 80:22)
we did report on this because it was (80:21 - 80:23)
that dumb (80:22 - 80:26)
[Laughter] (80:23 - 80:28)

plan for a lot of movies these days (85:53 - 85:58)
how much would you pay to rent or buy (85:55 - 86:00)
the new pokemon movie if that option (85:58 - 86:02)
became available (86:00 - 86:04)
so by new pokemon movie we mean coco (86:02 - 86:06)
coco (86:04 - 86:09)
or i'm we could even say detect let's (86:06 - 86:12)
just say detective pikachu too (86:09 - 86:14)
isn't didn't they say that like some (86:12 - 86:17)
mulan is gonna be like forty dollars (86:14 - 86:21)
to rent thirty thirty ninety nine it's (86:17 - 86:22)
29.99 live (86:21 - 86:24)
action something that was already done (86:22 - 86:25)
better as a cartoon (86:24 - 86:27)
well we don't know that it was done (86:25 - 86:29)
better as a cartoon chances are very (86:27 - 86:31)
good that it was done better as a (86:29 - 86:32)
cartoon (86:31 - 86:36)
but uh disney plus (86:32 - 86:38)
will you'll be able to watch it for a (86:36 - 86:39)
thirty dollar fee (86:38 - 86:40)
but you're already paying like seven (86:39 - 86:43)
dollars a month to get into disney plus (86:40 - 86:46)
yeah um look number one there's no (86:43 - 86:48)
disney in my house (86:46 - 86:51)
they can plus all they want okay number (86:48 - 86:52)
one (86:51 - 86:54)
if you go to a movie in new york city (86:52 - 86:55)
which i did (86:54 - 87:00)
once like even even 20 years ago (86:55 - 87:03)
that alone for two people was easily 30 (87:00 - 87:04)
dollars (87:03 - 87:07)
yeah easily (87:04 - 87:10)
so a family of four having to pay thirty (87:07 - 87:11)
dollars to watch mulan to keep their (87:10 - 87:13)
kids quiet for however long that movie (87:11 - 87:14)
is (87:13 - 87:15)
they will pay that money for a piece of (87:14 - 87:17)
money a family of four (87:15 - 87:20)
i'm a barely a family of one okay well (87:17 - 87:20)
then we (87:20 - 87:22)
i will drag the tv outside we will (87:20 - 87:24)
socially distance and that will be three (87:22 - 87:25)
of us (87:24 - 87:26)
you can bring you can bring whoever you (87:25 - 87:29)
want that'll be a family (87:26 - 87:32)
that'll be a family of five and two dogs (87:29 - 87:33)
it's a family of seven for (87:32 - 87:36)
for thirty dollars it's a bargain i (87:33 - 87:38)
don't know if this works (87:36 - 87:40)
do you think this is gonna work yeah it (87:38 - 87:41)
works for trolls (87:40 - 87:43)
if yeah but trolls wasn't thirty dollars (87:41 - 87:45)
it was like ten wasn't it okay (87:43 - 87:46)
and let's to clarify for the people who (87:45 - 87:48)
heard the word trolls and just thought (87:46 - 87:49)
like basically all the people that watch (87:48 - 87:51)
steve on twitch (87:49 - 87:54)
uh trolls world tour was a movie (87:51 - 87:57)
yes and wasn't it like marcus or amc (87:54 - 87:58)
that got really mad and was like we're (87:57 - 88:00)
not gonna let you (87:58 - 88:02)
show movies in our theaters again they (88:00 - 88:04)
they did do that they did say (88:02 - 88:07)
you know what uh nah dawg (88:04 - 88:10)
uh isn't it on amazon prime is that who (88:07 - 88:13)
did who released it (88:10 - 88:15)
i don't know for a pokemon movie i would (88:13 - 88:16)
happily pay (88:15 - 88:19)
up to 4.99 but i would prefer to pay (88:16 - 88:21)
1.99 (88:19 - 88:24)
i think the most i would pay for a brand (88:21 - 88:25)
new movie that i couldn't see in (88:24 - 88:28)
theaters because of economic times would (88:25 - 88:31)
maybe be 15 bucks oh you would go that (88:28 - 88:31)
high (88:31 - 88:34)
if it was a new detective pikachu i (88:31 - 88:34)
would probably pay (88:34 - 88:38)
up to 10. but i i strongly believe that (88:34 - 88:40)
netflix is going to (88:38 - 88:44)
just pay for a movie outright to show up (88:40 - 88:45)
disney (88:44 - 88:48)
i they would netflix has already (88:45 - 88:49)
produced movies (88:48 - 88:51)
and yeah yes paid for movies outright (88:49 - 88:52)
they produce their own movies right no (88:51 - 88:54)
but i'm saying like they they (88:52 - 88:56)
cl they definitely paid for mewtwo (88:54 - 88:58)
strikes back or whatever (88:56 - 89:00)
so i could see them paying for coco and (88:58 - 89:02)
being like coco is exclusive on here (89:00 - 89:05)
just for free stick it to to stick it to (89:02 - 89:06)
disney and to stick it to these other (89:05 - 89:08)
platforms (89:06 - 89:11)
um i would pay (89:08 - 89:16)
at most for a poke upon movie (89:11 - 89:19)
in my home at most 2.99 (89:16 - 89:22)
why if i had a bad guy at 15. i thought (89:19 - 89:24)
you guys were gonna say like ten (89:22 - 89:27)
no okay i would pay ten dollars for the (89:24 - 89:29)
movie theater experience that has a (89:27 - 89:30)
great sound (89:29 - 89:33)
a huge screen in my home i'm not (89:30 - 89:34)
bothered by anything (89:33 - 89:36)
i usually will go on a matinee or on a (89:34 - 89:38)
tuesday so it's eight dollars (89:36 - 89:40)
that is an experience i'm willing to pay (89:38 - 89:42)
for although (89:40 - 89:44)
pokemon has a history of doing terrible (89:42 - 89:45)
movies so (89:44 - 89:47)
when i went and saw the power of us (89:45 - 89:49)
which was furry (89:47 - 89:51)
i wanted my money back for the time that (89:49 - 89:53)
i lost there (89:51 - 89:54)
so given the fact that their track (89:53 - 89:56)
record is (89:54 - 89:58)
mostly abysmal full disclosure we got (89:56 - 90:01)
free tickets the power bus (89:58 - 90:05)
free ticket to power of us oh (90:01 - 90:06)
i took it remember we were going to do (90:05 - 90:08)
something oh we were recording (90:06 - 90:10)
uh b team and i was at that instead (90:08 - 90:12)
because it went up for free (90:10 - 90:15)
uh so given that i would (90:12 - 90:18)
maybe pay 299 like if (90:15 - 90:21)
if people said it was really good but (90:18 - 90:22)
they'd have to say it was really really (90:21 - 90:23)
good like (90:22 - 90:25)
it's the best movie in years and by (90:23 - 90:26)
people i mean (90:25 - 90:29)
not steve yeah basically i didn't say (90:26 - 90:30)
the power of what's good (90:29 - 90:33)
no awesome you think a lot of pokemon (90:30 - 90:34)
movies are good that aren't no i (90:33 - 90:37)
don't i say they're okay (90:34 - 90:40)
so my other thing though is i i just (90:37 - 90:41)
don't (90:40 - 90:44)
i it's so rare for me to consume passive (90:41 - 90:45)
media (90:44 - 90:48)
if it's not youtube skate bits so (90:45 - 90:51)
it's gonna call you out so hard because (90:48 - 90:52)
you so (90:51 - 90:55)
do you watch skaters and bikers go down (90:52 - 90:57)
a bike trail a piano okay i watch (90:55 - 91:00)
craze i was there freestyle (90:57 - 91:02)
bike videos i watched skate vids from (91:00 - 91:04)
the 90s and early 2000s (91:02 - 91:06)
yes that's sweet i don't watch gator (91:04 - 91:08)
tracks (91:06 - 91:11)
i don't watch movies that are (91:08 - 91:14)
movies i don't watch tv shows that are (91:11 - 91:15)
tv shows (91:14 - 91:19)
if it doesn't feature some dude doing (91:15 - 91:20)
like a frontside (91:19 - 91:24)
50 50 down to nine i'm not interested (91:20 - 91:26)
so you wouldn't see tony hawk the movie (91:24 - 91:28)
is what you're saying (91:26 - 91:32)
i mean tony hawk ain't making no movies (91:28 - 91:33)
with that attitude look they're getting (91:32 - 91:35)
desperate (91:33 - 91:39)
the last movie i rented off itunes (91:35 - 91:43)
which was like a month ago was the uh (91:39 - 91:47)
the sonic movie uh (91:43 - 91:49)
and it was all right i lost i want to (91:47 - 91:51)
see the original cut (91:49 - 91:53)
yeah release the sonic director's cut (91:51 - 91:54)
cowards (91:53 - 91:56)
it was okay it was where i think it was (91:54 - 91:58)
5.99 to rent it (91:56 - 92:01)
yeah that's pretty standard (91:58 - 92:03)
i thought i thought it was worth the six (92:01 - 92:05)
bucks at the end of the day i mean if it (92:03 - 92:06)
was a bad movie i probably would have (92:05 - 92:07)
said dude (92:06 - 92:08)
would have said it was not worth six (92:07 - 92:10)
bucks but i was i was (92:08 - 92:14)
uh entertained for the 90 (92:10 - 92:16)
minutes or whatever how long it was i (92:14 - 92:17)
was like yeah that was a good use of my (92:16 - 92:18)
time (92:17 - 92:20)
i laughed it was funny it was fine it (92:18 - 92:21)
was sonic (92:20 - 92:24)
it went real fast he did go fast yeah i (92:21 - 92:26)
have no clue how good or bad coco would (92:24 - 92:27)
be (92:26 - 92:30)
but i feel like if for whatever reason (92:27 - 92:31)
it came out here (92:30 - 92:34)
on netflix on christmas day if it came (92:31 - 92:36)
out here on netflix christmas day for (92:34 - 92:37)
free i will watch it (92:36 - 92:39)
i will watch just about anything pokemon (92:37 - 92:41)
related for free i don't think (92:39 - 92:43)
the pokemon company and disney are doing (92:41 - 92:45)
anything together anytime soon but if (92:43 - 92:47)
for every reason they came on disney (92:45 - 92:48)
plus and they were like ah you can watch (92:47 - 92:50)
it for 20 bucks (92:48 - 92:52)
no i don't think i don't think i can do (92:50 - 92:53)
that no no (92:52 - 92:55)
no no no no no no no no no not unless (92:53 - 92:56)
there were like eight (92:55 - 92:58)
to ten of us in the room because i was (92:56 - 93:01)
collecting two dollars from each of you (92:58 - 93:05)
then venmo me your your portion of the (93:01 - 93:05)
movie tickets (93:05 - 93:09)
passing around the pan like if somebody (93:05 - 93:10)
says mulan is (93:09 - 93:12)
excellent excellent excellent like such (93:10 - 93:14)
a better version of it (93:12 - 93:17)
i may consider (93:14 - 93:21)
maybe but nah like (93:17 - 93:23)
i look so i have amazon prime and when i (93:21 - 93:24)
get to the thing where it says like you (93:23 - 93:26)
can rent this i'm like nope (93:24 - 93:29)
i'm out there so much for free there's (93:26 - 93:30)
just so much for free (93:29 - 93:33)
i have netflix i turn it on i scroll (93:30 - 93:34)
through i'm like there is literally (93:33 - 93:36)
nothing here i want to see and i turn it (93:34 - 93:36)
off (93:36 - 93:41)
and go to a sick girl skateboard vid (93:36 - 93:43)
i need to see if netflix has skateboard (93:41 - 93:45)
vids to lure you back into they do not (93:43 - 93:45)
family (93:45 - 93:49)
they do not does netflix not have (93:45 - 93:51)
gleaming the cube (93:49 - 93:55)
get out of here with your trash mouth (93:51 - 93:55)
uh well give us our pokemon of the week (93:56 - 94:01)
last week's pokemon of the week (93:59 - 94:04)
uh was from sinnoh uh (94:01 - 94:07)
it is an ice type um which is actually (94:04 - 94:09)
very strange that it takes a long time (94:07 - 94:11)
to get to the ice types in sinnoh even (94:09 - 94:13)
though it's a northern territory which (94:11 - 94:14)
you think it'd be colder look you're (94:13 - 94:15)
talking about the region that has two (94:14 - 94:16)
fire pokemon (94:15 - 94:19)
one being ponyta (94:16 - 94:23)
well either way uh (94:19 - 94:25)
so the first ice type that appears is a (94:23 - 94:27)
mono ice type (94:25 - 94:30)
um and then you have this one or it has (94:27 - 94:32)
to be primary ice type so not (94:30 - 94:35)
ice type as the second type um (94:32 - 94:37)
you cannot you can only catch this (94:35 - 94:39)
pokemon in the wild (94:37 - 94:40)
in black and white and black and white (94:39 - 94:43)
too there's literally no other game does (94:40 - 94:44)
it ever appear in the wild (94:43 - 94:48)
so only in univa are there wild of this (94:44 - 94:50)
running around um and you if you do want (94:48 - 94:52)
to evolve it you have to (94:50 - 94:54)
follow a special condition it has to (94:52 - 94:56)
i'll give you the clue i didn't give (94:54 - 94:58)
last week it has to know a special move (94:56 - 95:00)
um which is similar to what tangela (94:58 - 95:02)
needs to know in order to (95:00 - 95:06)
evolve into tan growth um and then (95:02 - 95:08)
i referenced a science article about (95:06 - 95:10)
trying to restore from (95:08 - 95:13)
some frozen dna but it's not a dinosaur (95:10 - 95:16)
so who is that pokemon (95:13 - 95:22)
it's cantonian sandslash (95:16 - 95:25)
yes correct because cantonian sandslash (95:22 - 95:26)
requires (95:25 - 95:28)
special conditions to evolve which (95:26 - 95:32)
that's something we had in gen 1. (95:28 - 95:35)
man i'm so good at this it's mammal (95:32 - 95:39)
swine it is mammo swine (95:35 - 95:42)
all-time favorite pokemon i love mammo (95:39 - 95:43)
swine so much (95:42 - 95:45)
i don't like its eyes i wish its eyes (95:43 - 95:47)
were different otherwise (95:45 - 95:49)
shiny was different is that why x and y (95:47 - 95:50)
is your favorite game because you ride (95:49 - 95:52)
on one (95:50 - 95:55)
well i love i love writing on ammo swing (95:52 - 95:57)
i don't know i was so (95:55 - 95:59)
i wanted pokemon writing to be so much (95:57 - 96:01)
more than what it ended up being (95:59 - 96:03)
i really thought that in x and y there (96:01 - 96:05)
was gonna be like a race like your mom's (96:03 - 96:06)
like i'm a world chris (96:05 - 96:08)
i'm a world-class horn racer and you're (96:06 - 96:10)
like oh cool maybe later in the game (96:08 - 96:11)
i'll race a rhyhorn and you're like no (96:10 - 96:14)
no that doesn't happen nah nah i mean (96:11 - 96:16)
that's your mom's thing that's not your (96:14 - 96:17)
thing (96:16 - 96:19)
exactly it's all about breaking free (96:17 - 96:20)
from your (96:19 - 96:21)
your parents and discovering your own (96:20 - 96:23)
identity at age (96:21 - 96:26)
10. yeah i think you were like 14 in x (96:23 - 96:27)
and y (96:26 - 96:30)
oh probably 13 or 14. you don't like the (96:27 - 96:33)
ski goggles i like the ski gog a lot (96:30 - 96:36)
no there's just something that's like (96:33 - 96:40)
too the sunken (96:36 - 96:42)
i think that's that's my issue some (96:40 - 96:44)
trivia here mamo swine (96:42 - 96:46)
would have been obtainable in both gen 2 (96:44 - 96:47)
and gen 3 (96:46 - 96:52)
if it existed as piloswine (96:47 - 96:55)
how is that trivia as pilots (96:52 - 96:57)
said sure you could learn ancient power (96:55 - 96:58)
in both generations (96:57 - 97:00)
so that's the thing is that the pokemon (96:58 - 97:02)
has to know ancient power (97:00 - 97:06)
in order for it to be able to evolve (97:02 - 97:08)
saying is like tangula couldn't learn (97:06 - 97:09)
ancient power (97:08 - 97:13)
in two or three right um (97:09 - 97:14)
no other pokemon has the same type (97:13 - 97:17)
combination as mammal swine (97:14 - 97:19)
and it's pre-evolutions uh and mamo (97:17 - 97:21)
swine and its pre-evolutions are the (97:19 - 97:22)
only pokemon weak to (97:21 - 97:25)
all three starter pokemon hey that's (97:22 - 97:26)
actually really good trivia (97:25 - 97:28)
that's that one's a good one here you go (97:26 - 97:30)
way to finally get it (97:28 - 97:33)
finally get it done bubblepedia it's a (97:30 - 97:33)
pokemon (97:33 - 97:35)
swine is a comet has a combination of (97:33 - 97:37)
mammoth (97:35 - 97:39)
and swine you don't have to has that uh (97:37 - 97:41)
shuffle icon there (97:39 - 97:44)
it's good uh sweet it's good it's good (97:41 - 97:45)

in pokey park we pikachu's adventure (97:48 - 97:54)

mammal swine is like the number one i (97:54 - 97:59)
want you to fix the shiny (97:56 - 98:02)
well that's not gonna happen i know it's (97:59 - 98:04)
just such a gross green (98:02 - 98:08)
now if it was called charo swine (98:04 - 98:11)
it'd be black and sleek and cool yeah (98:08 - 98:14)
it'd be black and red and purple and (98:11 - 98:17)
oh wow week's pokemon (98:14 - 98:20)

favorite pokemon of all time (98:40 - 98:45)
tickles tickles was one of the key (98:43 - 98:46)
pokemon that (98:45 - 98:49)
i brought to pokemon us nationals in (98:46 - 98:51)
2012. (98:49 - 98:53)
i thought it looked really cool with a w (98:51 - 98:55)
on its head matching the w (98:53 - 98:57)
in my name i distinctly remember that i (98:55 - 98:59)
knew absolutely nothing about (98:57 - 99:01)
competitive battling at the time and had (98:59 - 99:01)
pretty much (99:01 - 99:03)
only brought a team so that i could (99:01 - 99:05)
battle with wheels and irene (99:03 - 99:08)
who were also in the vgc competition (99:05 - 99:11)
my memory may be flawed here i just (99:08 - 99:12)
checked in pokemon home (99:11 - 99:15)
and tickles is currently at level 67. (99:12 - 99:18)
i don't think i ever used her after 2012 (99:15 - 99:19)
us nationals (99:18 - 99:23)
so that's where she is frozen in time (99:19 - 99:25)
i do know that my main tactic in using (99:23 - 99:28)
tickles was to try to use fisher (99:25 - 99:31)
a ground type one hit knockout move (99:28 - 99:34)
for those in the know oco moves (99:31 - 99:36)
are never used in competitive vgc (99:34 - 99:38)
because they have a very low possibility (99:36 - 99:39)
of hitting (99:38 - 99:42)
even with accuracy improving items by (99:39 - 99:43)
the time everyone at dinner the night (99:42 - 99:45)
before had informed me that my pokemon (99:43 - 99:47)
and moves choices were garbage (99:45 - 99:50)
that my pokemon needed held items and (99:47 - 99:52)
they should all be over level 50 (99:50 - 99:55)
i realized i didn't stand a chance in (99:52 - 99:56)
2012 (99:55 - 99:58)
i did not have a good sense of pokemon (99:56 - 100:01)
tools available on the internet (99:58 - 100:03)
tickle's other moves were aqua tale (100:01 - 100:04)
earthquake (100:03 - 100:07)
and future sight she received stab from (100:04 - 100:08)
aqua tale (100:07 - 100:10)
an earthquake and i've never been able (100:08 - 100:12)
to figure out why this particular (100:10 - 100:14)
pokemon has access to future sight (100:12 - 100:16)
future sight is both a weird and (100:14 - 100:18)
terrible move (100:16 - 100:20)
she has a docile nature meaning that (100:18 - 100:22)
none of her stats were improved or (100:20 - 100:22)
hindered (100:22 - 100:26)
and her ability is anticipation her (100:22 - 100:28)
pokemon species is one of the few (100:26 - 100:30)
non-psychic types that can have (100:28 - 100:32)
anticipation as an ability (100:30 - 100:34)
and they are the only ones including her (100:32 - 100:35)
pre-evolution (100:34 - 100:37)
with her type combination that can have (100:35 - 100:39)
it at all (100:37 - 100:41)
anticipation which causes your pokemon (100:39 - 100:43)
to shudder if one of the opposing (100:41 - 100:46)
pokemon has a super effective move (100:43 - 100:48)
is a terrible ability to have in pokemon (100:46 - 100:49)
vgc (100:48 - 100:52)
smogon has sorted tickles into its pu (100:49 - 100:53)
tier (100:52 - 100:55)
as they describe their lowest official (100:53 - 100:56)
usage-based (100:55 - 100:59)
tier with the following overview with (100:56 - 101:01)
access to dragon dance (100:59 - 101:04)
a fairly rare move for pokemon and pu (101:01 - 101:06)
and a typing that allows it to resist (101:04 - 101:09)
types that are fairly common in pu (101:06 - 101:12)
tickles may seem like a good choice for (101:09 - 101:13)
a setup sweeper (101:12 - 101:16)
however in reality it has horrible (101:13 - 101:18)
offensive and defensive stats that make (101:16 - 101:20)
it extremely difficult to do damage and (101:18 - 101:22)
seem like a threat (101:20 - 101:24)
tickle's lack of coverage and severely (101:22 - 101:25)
disappointing stats (101:24 - 101:28)
even at plus one make it near impossible (101:25 - 101:30)
to sweep an entire team (101:28 - 101:32)
as its terrible speed allows it to get (101:30 - 101:33)
revenge killed (101:32 - 101:36)
very easily that makes it very difficult (101:33 - 101:37)
setting up without (101:36 - 101:40)
fainting there you go that is the (101:37 - 101:41)
pokemon of the week (101:40 - 101:44)
if you don't know it by now do some (101:41 - 101:45)
research (101:44 - 101:48)
figure it out (101:45 - 101:48)
all right we will be back next (101:48 - 101:54)
week of course two weeks left on the (101:51 - 101:55)
