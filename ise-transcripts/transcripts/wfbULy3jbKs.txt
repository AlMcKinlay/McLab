gram influencer TV which is Facebook (1:52 - 1:58)
Garbo TV is not the place to be nah so (1:55 - 2:02)

final bug too shiny hunt was gonna be (2:04 - 2:12)
snow slash frost moth but my buddy Josh (2:07 - 2:15)

Pokemon engagement ring has gone (4:40 - 4:48)
terribly wrong that's true yeah are we (4:43 - 4:54)
allowed this was sent in by Stuart in (4:48 - 4:57)
our slack channel before we talked about (4:54 - 4:59)
this engagement ring we got a lot of (4:57 - 5:01)
Pokemon go news this week and we have (4:59 - 5:04)
some video game slash TCG championship (5:01 - 5:07)
stuff going for currently and then (5:04 - 5:10)
getting ready for the 2021 season which (5:07 - 5:12)
who knows if there will even be a 2021 (5:10 - 5:16)
at this right that's that's the that's (5:12 - 5:20)
the show Japanese jewelry company Ginza (5:16 - 5:24)
Tanaka is selling Pikachu inspired rings (5:20 - 5:26)
this is a partnership with the Pokemon (5:24 - 5:28)
company these are not knock offerings (5:26 - 5:30)
for couples looking to make their (5:28 - 5:34)
marriage themed there are two concepts (5:30 - 5:38)
here they run roughly a hundred and (5:34 - 5:42)
fifteen thousand to three hundred and (5:38 - 5:45)
forty six thousand yen which translates (5:42 - 5:48)
to about one thousand to three thousand (5:45 - 5:52)
dollars it's a Pikachu head emblem with (5:48 - 5:55)
I choose u graved inside of the band and (5:52 - 5:58)
one is like the Pikachu head and then (5:55 - 6:00)
one is like the two pikachu tails that's (5:58 - 6:02)
it (6:00 - 6:04)
that's that's all there is to the story (6:02 - 6:07)
I guess the transition was better than (6:04 - 6:09)
the story the punk about ring is good (6:07 - 6:12)
they've done plenty of jewelry before (6:09 - 6:16)
yes this is like not really a shock I (6:12 - 6:19)
think actually if you were to go on to (6:16 - 6:22)
Pokemon Center comm they have a they (6:19 - 6:24)
have rings they have anywhere between (6:22 - 6:25)
like a hundred one hundred fifty dollar (6:24 - 6:28)
rings they have $80 earrings they have (6:25 - 6:31)
two hundred dollar bracelets I'm sure (6:28 - 6:32)
there's somebody out there that really (6:31 - 6:35)
wants to it once a Pikachu wedding ring (6:32 - 6:36)
for a thousand dollars I'm sure that (6:35 - 6:38)
person exists I'm sure they will be very (6:36 - 6:41)
happy I don't know as much as I love (6:38 - 6:45)
Pokemon I don't know if I need my entire (6:41 - 6:49)
life Pokemon doubt I mean this spring is (6:45 - 6:50)
only gone terribly wrong from a matter (6:49 - 6:51)
of perspective (6:50 - 6:55)
some of us perfectly fine it's perfectly (6:51 - 6:57)
fine yeah Megan from the verge really (6:55 - 7:00)
really not into this ring well then it's (6:57 - 7:04)
not for her Megan move on also I just (7:00 - 7:07)
think the ears would hurt after a while (7:04 - 7:11)
yeah Heidi you'd have to either wear it (7:07 - 7:13)
away from your knuckle so that you (7:11 - 7:15)
weren't constantly digging those ears (7:13 - 7:17)
into your hand or I don't know what (7:15 - 7:18)
you're gonna do hmm (7:17 - 7:21)
yeah cuz if you yeah if you like bend (7:18 - 7:24)
your fingers back then yeah hmm like (7:21 - 7:27)
either either way there's no there's no (7:24 - 7:29)
hand model here well somebody called (7:27 - 7:32)
slep Seinfeld from 25 years ago and (7:29 - 7:35)
let's go with the joke oh yeah there was (7:32 - 7:37)
a hand model joking that no I'm just (7:35 - 7:41)
spouting nonsense you don't stop I will (7:37 - 7:43)
say that this is not the first time (7:41 - 7:45)
they've done wedding stuff they had a (7:43 - 7:47)
complete wedding thing last year I'm (7:45 - 7:49)
assuming what they do is they probably (7:47 - 7:51)
make a limited supply of these they sell (7:49 - 7:53)
out and then they go well it's wedding (7:51 - 7:56)
season again what do we have in the (7:53 - 7:58)
pipeline that we could produce but last (7:56 - 8:01)
year when I was in Japan they did have (7:58 - 8:02)
the they didn't have wedding stuff I (8:01 - 8:04)
think they even had it where you could (8:02 - 8:07)
actually pay for an entire Pokemon (8:04 - 8:09)
themed wedding specifically in Japan (8:07 - 8:13)
where Pikachu would show up they did (8:09 - 8:14)
have wedding stuff at the Pokemon (8:13 - 8:15)
centers and I read and I (8:14 - 8:19)
little wedding flutes like champagne (8:15 - 8:19)
flutes (8:19 - 8:21)
yeah champagne blue not musical flutes (8:19 - 8:25)
right instrument and one had like misses (8:21 - 8:26)
and then I had the female Pikachu and (8:25 - 8:28)
the one said missed her and I had a male (8:26 - 8:29)
Pikachu obviously that doesn't work for (8:28 - 8:32)
any gay couples but for the standard (8:29 - 8:36)
male/female Pikachu couple well I guess (8:32 - 8:39)
maybe you could just buy two of them and (8:36 - 8:41)
then you have two misters or two misses (8:39 - 8:42)
but then you got to figure out where to (8:41 - 8:45)
do with the other anyways besides that (8:42 - 8:47)
we do have these these Pikachu flutes I (8:45 - 8:49)
think they were like oh gosh they're (8:47 - 8:51)
probably like 60 bucks the package like (8:49 - 8:53)
there's a I mean you're paying because (8:51 - 8:55)
they slap the word wedding on it and (8:53 - 8:57)
they're they're paying off your emotions (8:55 - 8:59)
at that point but I like them a lot (8:57 - 9:01)
we've never used them they're in our (8:59 - 9:04)
cabinet and the fancy box have you ever (9:01 - 9:05)
used them I think we're gonna use them (9:04 - 9:09)
on the first year thingy (9:05 - 9:12)
yeah the anniversary Dealey look I read (9:09 - 9:14)
and I hung out on our anniversary and (9:12 - 9:16)
then we were like should we bust up the (9:14 - 9:17)
champagne flutes that we were both like (9:16 - 9:20)
now let's go to bed (9:17 - 9:24)
hung out on our anniversary ready the (9:20 - 9:28)
downward slide begins romance is dead in (9:24 - 9:31)
this country I can't be bothered to get (9:28 - 9:35)
my pika shoot two champagne flutes this (9:31 - 9:39)
is not specifically Pokemon news but the (9:35 - 9:43)
podcast Awards podcast Awards com are (9:39 - 9:48)
open from now until July 31st I did (9:43 - 9:52)
throw our little old podcast into the (9:48 - 9:56)
Hat you had to pay to throw yourself (9:52 - 9:59)
into the head I think they're the (9:56 - 10:00)
problem that they've expressed is (9:59 - 10:03)
podcast will get nominated and win and (10:00 - 10:05)
then those podcasts will not care about (10:03 - 10:08)
winning hmm so then they would get a (10:05 - 10:10)
trophy made for somebody who has no (10:08 - 10:12)
interest in winning it's just their fans (10:10 - 10:15)
voted for them and in order to even get (10:12 - 10:18)
nominated the podcast has to pay an (10:15 - 10:20)
entry fee it's not that much it was like (10:18 - 10:22)
I think like 50 bucks or something and (10:20 - 10:26)
then you will go onto the list so that (10:22 - 10:29)
way podcast who do not care about (10:26 - 10:29)
winning (10:29 - 10:32)
do not win well they don't get entered (10:29 - 10:34)
for consideration right yes so we are (10:32 - 10:36)
entered for consideration I believe (10:34 - 10:38)
there are fifteen or twenty gaming (10:36 - 10:40)
podcasts they will only take the top ten (10:38 - 10:42)
to the finals so if you would like to (10:40 - 10:45)
help out do the nomination I timed it it (10:42 - 10:47)
takes about 60 seconds you do have to (10:45 - 10:49)
make an account but you go to podcast (10:47 - 10:51)
Awards calm you click the big button (10:49 - 10:54)
that says click me you make your account (10:51 - 10:57)
and then you can wear under the gaming (10:54 - 10:58)
section there is a bunch of other (10:57 - 11:00)
podcasts under different fields if you (10:58 - 11:01)
want to vote you don't have to vote for (11:00 - 11:02)
them you could just vote for gaming but (11:01 - 11:05)
I will probably remind you guys every (11:02 - 11:10)
episode so the $50.00 doesn't completely (11:05 - 11:13)
go to waste but I really think we could (11:10 - 11:14)
actually win this year I think between (11:13 - 11:16)
our slack and our discord and the twitch (11:14 - 11:18)
and all our podcast listeners I think we (11:16 - 11:21)
have a pretty decent audience when we (11:18 - 11:22)
tried this I think we tried this geez (11:21 - 11:25)
like seven years ago so I think I think (11:22 - 11:26)
we got a pretty good chance of winning I (11:25 - 11:28)
can't tell you who are really competing (11:26 - 11:30)
against cuz I don't know what the final (11:28 - 11:32)
ten people will be but they don't think (11:30 - 11:34)
something like giant bomb or the (11:32 - 11:36)
instance I don't think they care about (11:34 - 11:38)
this kind of stuff anymore so I don't (11:36 - 11:39)
think we have to worry about those (11:38 - 11:42)
juggernauts that exist in the gaming (11:39 - 11:45)
space so podcast Awards comm if you want (11:42 - 11:48)
help out with that okay do you want to (11:45 - 11:50)
do pokemon ghost stuff or do you want to (11:48 - 11:53)
do video game championship stuff (11:50 - 11:56)
hmm game championship first cuz that's (11:53 - 11:58)
why I tuned in and then I can just tune (11:56 - 12:00)
right on out for Pokemon go okay cool (11:58 - 12:03)
this up Pokemon calm this is the 2020 (12:00 - 12:06)
Pokemon video game championship VGC (12:03 - 12:09)
format rules they have changed because (12:06 - 12:12)
of aisle of armor the following Pokemon (12:09 - 12:15)
are now now permitted using the official (12:12 - 12:18)
video game championship format pokemon (12:15 - 12:21)
in the Iowa aisle of armor pokedex (12:18 - 12:24)
including cup foo and uh Shifu are now (12:21 - 12:24)
permitted (12:24 - 12:27)
Blastoise Venusaur Rilla boom cinder ace (12:24 - 12:31)
intel ian and earth shook Giganta max (12:27 - 12:33)
factor permit i don't know why they said (12:31 - 12:35)
jeanette checking its max factor and not (12:33 - 12:36)
Giganta max form maybe that's actually (12:35 - 12:39)
what you call it are permitted the jerk (12:36 - 12:44)
it's max factor KO Balian taarakian and (12:39 - 12:48)
Virizion are also permitted they don't (12:44 - 12:51)
exist in the isle of armor but i guess (12:48 - 12:53)
hey you can use them if you want and (12:51 - 12:55)
well yet i mean i'm sure they'll get (12:53 - 12:57)
added in at some point (12:55 - 12:59)
yeah i'm i'm sure they're part of the (12:57 - 13:02)
crown Tundra with probably every other (12:59 - 13:05)
legendary pokemon pokemon with the (13:02 - 13:08)
battle-ready symbol that would otherwise (13:05 - 13:09)
be eligible for competition are (13:08 - 13:12)
permitted now we talked about this I (13:09 - 13:13)
think two weeks ago we'll talk about it (13:12 - 13:15)
again and you might be asking like why (13:13 - 13:18)
can you use cabal a Interac and Virizion (13:15 - 13:20)
if you cannot catch them in past (13:18 - 13:23)
official competitions you have to while (13:20 - 13:25)
at least in certain shield you have to (13:23 - 13:26)
use Pokemon with the sword and shield (13:25 - 13:28)
symbol just like in Sun and Moon you (13:26 - 13:31)
would have to use them with the I think (13:28 - 13:32)
Sun and Moon was like the Pentagon (13:31 - 13:36)
symbol and then X&Y was the clover (13:32 - 13:39)
symbol sure sword and shield it looks (13:36 - 13:41)
like kind of a pokeball with a swish (13:39 - 13:45)
through it but anyways that when even if (13:41 - 13:47)
you did not purchase isle of armor when (13:45 - 13:50)
you did the update to a dial of our mark (13:47 - 13:53)
there's a dude in the Rose tower that (13:50 - 13:55)
just suddenly appears he's just standing (13:53 - 13:58)
by the elevator you talked to him he (13:55 - 14:01)
will take any of your old Pokemon and he (13:58 - 14:04)
will make them battle-ready meaning if (14:01 - 14:06)
you caught a shiny (14:04 - 14:09)
Parminder in in diamond and pearl that's (14:06 - 14:11)
not true you can't find Charmander and (14:09 - 14:14)
diamond the pro but if for whatever (14:11 - 14:16)
reason you catched it you could add it (14:14 - 14:18)
yeah yeah yeah there you go you can read (14:16 - 14:21)
it if you if you first discovered the (14:18 - 14:23)
Masuda method and diamond and pearl and (14:21 - 14:25)
you bred yourself a Charmander and then (14:23 - 14:28)
you moved him all the way up into gen (14:25 - 14:30)
seven and then all the way up with the (14:28 - 14:31)
gen 8 because that's where we're are we (14:30 - 14:34)
are right now and you're like man I wish (14:31 - 14:36)
this Charmander could be ready you could (14:34 - 14:38)
talk to that guy in rose tower and he (14:36 - 14:40)
will make your Charmander permitted into (14:38 - 14:43)
battle and you can use it in an official (14:40 - 14:45)
tournament which is a huge huge huge (14:43 - 14:48)
huge change I honestly I cannot state (14:45 - 14:51)
enough how fantastic I think that is (14:48 - 14:54)
because I just I have so many (14:51 - 14:57)
competitive VGC teams that you know (14:54 - 14:59)
people made for me and traded to me or (14:57 - 15:01)
that I bred for myself and put together (14:59 - 15:04)
that I it's like I can finally use them (15:01 - 15:06)
again and that's um super excited (15:04 - 15:08)
anymore it's just like these are my (15:06 - 15:10)
special friends that I had from the past (15:08 - 15:14)
I mean I had that with you know I bred (15:10 - 15:18)
and had a shiny hidden ability (15:14 - 15:21)
intimidate in sin Aurora from Sun and (15:18 - 15:23)
Moon and I was like ok this is cool (15:21 - 15:25)
and sin Aurora was very popular back in (15:23 - 15:28)
back in the Sun and Moon days and then (15:25 - 15:30)
in sin roar is now able to be played and (15:28 - 15:32)
sword and shield and I was like well I (15:30 - 15:34)
really want to breed another hood like (15:32 - 15:36)
it was a lot of work like I I'll just (15:34 - 15:38)
just do a regular in sin Aurora this (15:36 - 15:41)
time around because I just I already (15:38 - 15:42)
have a shiny and sinner or I don't want (15:41 - 15:44)
to spin in circles for another shiny in (15:42 - 15:45)
center Aurora (15:44 - 15:47)
well spinning in circles where it's at (15:45 - 15:48)
on snapchat but you wouldn't know that's (15:47 - 15:51)
true and now I can I can just use that (15:48 - 15:54)
in sin Aurora now which is awesome and (15:51 - 15:56)
now I can keep my shiny (15:54 - 15:58)
toric at a shining torque at I don't (15:56 - 16:00)
need to and centaurs I got the whole (15:58 - 16:03)
family I got the crew another change I (16:00 - 16:05)
have been doing some competitive (16:03 - 16:07)
battling over the weekend is that (16:05 - 16:09)
normally when you queue up for a battle (16:07 - 16:11)
you see your team and then you have to (16:09 - 16:14)
hit like the X button and then you can (16:11 - 16:17)
see their team and your team but then (16:14 - 16:18)
you have to hit the X button again to go (16:17 - 16:20)
back so you can select your (16:18 - 16:22)
for Pokemon but they just did a (16:20 - 16:24)
quality-of-life change where they just (16:22 - 16:26)
you don't need to do that anymore they (16:24 - 16:27)
just put the team right on the first (16:26 - 16:30)
page you don't have to hit X and toggle (16:27 - 16:31)
back and forth you can just see your (16:30 - 16:34)
opponent's team and just select as as (16:31 - 16:37)
you do it which is if you probably if (16:34 - 16:38)
you've never competitive battle you're (16:37 - 16:40)
like that that doesn't sound like that (16:38 - 16:43)
big of a deal but like flipping back and (16:40 - 16:47)
forth was a hassle because you only have (16:43 - 16:49)
like 90 seconds to think and so by (16:47 - 16:51)
flipping back and forth and being like I (16:49 - 16:52)
do I want this one do I want that one (16:51 - 16:55)
having it all on page is just it really (16:52 - 16:59)
it alleviates some some pressure in my (16:55 - 17:02)
opinion I can see that it's a nice (16:59 - 17:05)
little change same same same deal all (17:02 - 17:07)
all battles are double battles each (17:05 - 17:08)
player needs an attentive switcher (17:07 - 17:10)
switch light physical or digital copies (17:08 - 17:12)
players will have to have the gallery (17:10 - 17:14)
symbol showing that it caught received (17:12 - 17:16)
hashed and gallery or the battle ready (17:14 - 17:18)
symbol showing they have transferred (17:16 - 17:19)
from another game and adapted to the (17:18 - 17:21)
battle in battles in Galler (17:19 - 17:24)
all Pokemon from the gallery regional (17:21 - 17:26)
pokedex and the isle of armored pokedex (17:24 - 17:29)
are permitted except for mythical and (17:26 - 17:31)
certain legendary Pokemon Oh could all (17:29 - 17:33)
Pokemon that can currently in Giganta (17:31 - 17:36)
max are allowed cabal iam track yen (17:33 - 17:38)
Virizion are permitted all Pokemon will (17:36 - 17:40)
be little fifty duplicate Pokemon not (17:38 - 17:43)
allowed duplicate held items not allowed (17:40 - 17:46)
each battle will have a 90 second team (17:43 - 17:48)
phase view that's what it's called team (17:46 - 17:50)
phase and each battle will have seven (17:48 - 17:53)
minutes of your time (17:50 - 17:57)
45 seconds move time 15 seconds 15 (17:53 - 18:00)
minutes game time so what that means is (17:57 - 18:02)
like a single game cannot go over 15 (18:00 - 18:04)
minutes but you just like in chess you (18:02 - 18:07)
have your own timer so if you take (18:04 - 18:09)
really really long on your turns you can (18:07 - 18:11)
technically lose based off your own (18:09 - 18:14)
timer but that rarely rarely rarely ever (18:11 - 18:17)
happens well at least for me cuz I'm bad (18:14 - 18:19)
and I'd lose well before that time or (18:17 - 18:22)
even comes close oh yeah I'm done chess (18:19 - 18:24)
is not my game all right so that's going (18:22 - 18:27)
on right now that is that is the current (18:24 - 18:30)
format if you're into that there is a (18:27 - 18:32)
lot of Rila booms and a lot of hidden (18:30 - 18:34)
ability real boom (18:32 - 18:35)
and a lot of hidden abilities in races (18:34 - 18:40)
that have seemed to pop up but maybe (18:35 - 18:43)
maybe you're done with the 20/20 maybe (18:40 - 18:45)
you're like 20/20 a bad year not (18:43 - 18:48)
interested I'm feeling 20 21 though (18:45 - 18:51)
that's not how I live my life but I'm (18:48 - 18:53)
sure you have a reason for saying that (18:51 - 18:57)

exclusive special research story which I (28:54 - 28:59)

yeah I enjoyed the story I enjoy doing (28:59 - 29:04)
the story with Greg and then talking (29:02 - 29:06)
about how we feel robbed yep (29:04 - 29:11)
the bonus will be in cents will last for (29:06 - 29:13)
three hours eggs will be 1/4 the hatched (29:11 - 29:17)
distance which i think is a bad bonus I (29:13 - 29:18)
think if you're still doing these six (29:17 - 29:19)
hour events and you're still making (29:18 - 29:21)
incense lasts for three hours because (29:19 - 29:22)
you still want people to play at home (29:21 - 29:25)
then why are you incentivizing egg-like (29:22 - 29:27)
you know your players are going out at (29:25 - 29:29)
this point I guess but it's okay the (29:27 - 29:31)
pandemic is over I am NOT talking to you (29:29 - 29:34)
I'm not touching this with a 100 (29:31 - 29:37)
bazillion foot pole you can sit out on (29:34 - 29:39)
that flight pole and wave in the wind by (29:37 - 29:42)
yourself but we're doing community (29:39 - 29:48)

nice heart Park or maybe over at Lake (29:48 - 29:55)
yeah bidet macaque ska that's so hard to (29:51 - 29:57)
say yeah that gets real busy though (29:55 - 29:59)
other little stops are on that there I (29:57 - 30:02)
think so my pokeball plus goes off a lot (29:59 - 30:03)
while I'm riding my bike around there (30:02 - 30:06)
what talk because there is still a (30:03 - 30:11)
global pandemic go Fest will be at home (30:06 - 30:14)
and there is a lead-up to go fest here (30:11 - 30:18)

but duck lit does not does it not (30:50 - 30:57)
million the moon fly I think you can I (30:54 - 31:00)
think you'd sky battle with it up and (30:57 - 31:03)
Dec the P in sky battles move on they're (31:00 - 31:05)
doing this thing where they will add (31:03 - 31:08)
bonus Pokemon to that will spawn during (31:05 - 31:10)
go fest I don't know if this is fun (31:08 - 31:16)
maybe on paper it's fun but who in their (31:10 - 31:18)
right okay so if 1 million trainers (31:16 - 31:20)
complete the research Chimecho will (31:18 - 31:23)
start spawning at go fest 1 million (31:20 - 31:26)
mystic players do it a la la mola spawns (31:23 - 31:28)
and then if 1 million Valor players do (31:26 - 31:31)
is it chancy as somebody who's on Team (31:28 - 31:33)
mystic do not complete this goal no one (31:31 - 31:35)
wants a Lola mola spawning and taking up (31:33 - 31:38)
like it's just a garbage spawn that's (31:35 - 31:40)
ruining other spawns no one wants this (31:38 - 31:42)
I have news I have sky battle news (31:40 - 31:45)
breaking news ok dynamo the electric (31:42 - 31:48)
pokemon can be in sky battles well heck (31:45 - 31:50)
yeah cuz it's got levitate dude duck (31:48 - 31:54)
'let cannot I knew it back to your (31:50 - 31:57)
regular scheduled ran Chimecho as long (31:54 - 31:59)
as they keep the Stardust Busan Chimecho (31:57 - 32:01)
I think that's fine Chansey can be shiny (31:59 - 32:03)
sure you can always use more chances but (32:01 - 32:05)
no one wants a la la mola I mean I kind (32:03 - 32:07)
of do you need one for your decks filler (32:05 - 32:09)

these tasks for your time research to (32:57 - 33:01)
count towards your go Fest you know I (32:59 - 33:03)
like to check the internet I like to (33:01 - 33:05)
check the rumblings yeah cuz you're a (33:03 - 33:08)
fool I look somebody has to stay on top (33:05 - 33:10)
of the somebody has to have their finger (33:08 - 33:15)
on the pulse of what of the Pokemon (33:10 - 33:20)
community seem like the hard core (33:15 - 33:21)
players were pretty happy with these (33:20 - 33:25)
tasks really it was catch 100 Pokemon (33:21 - 33:28)
hit 200 Pokemon total catch like 25 (33:25 - 33:31)
unique Pokemon and then make 50 (33:28 - 33:35)
excellent throws ooh that's tough for (33:31 - 33:37)
mr. Willie Anderson right there you have (33:35 - 33:41)
to do it before Wednesday July 8th so as (33:37 - 33:43)
of this as of us recording right now (33:41 - 33:44)
there's three at three days and six (33:43 - 33:46)
hours left well that's not happening (33:44 - 33:50)
then I feel so relieved yeah (33:46 - 33:52)
when I saw what the the hundred and the (33:50 - 33:54)
excellent throws thing I'm like and they (33:52 - 33:58)
get what for it bragging rights (33:54 - 34:03)
who does that letter so roomy I am NOT a (33:58 - 34:06)
child there aren't even in my early 20s (34:03 - 34:08)
there is no point where I'm gonna go to (34:06 - 34:12)
my lunch room at work and be like well (34:08 - 34:16)
well well fellows guess what I completed (34:12 - 34:20)
I have completed all the incredibly hard (34:16 - 34:23)
most difficult skill challenges in (34:20 - 34:27)
Pokemon go what are you doing and (34:23 - 34:31)
watching them all cry bitter tears this (34:27 - 34:33)
is not a thing that happens you're (34:31 - 34:37)
telling me that in your Twitter bio you (34:33 - 34:39)
don't have your Pokemon go start date (34:37 - 34:44)
how many times you've hit level 40 (34:39 - 34:44)
14:40 period because that's a sucker's (34:45 - 34:50)
game this is a real thing though you (34:48 - 34:52)
guys know this right I do know this and (34:50 - 34:55)
I actively ignore it and many of those (34:52 - 34:57)
people go unseen because I don't want to (34:55 - 35:00)
see it it is foolishness they have to (34:57 - 35:02)
like have to let you know that they (35:00 - 35:03)
started playing on day one that they're (35:02 - 35:06)
level forty times eight that they have (35:03 - 35:09)
that not only have they caught seven (35:06 - 35:10)
hundred shiny pokemon but they've (35:09 - 35:13)
released five hundred of them because (35:10 - 35:15)
they're not the most optimal pokemon (35:13 - 35:18)
that they could possibly use I think if (35:15 - 35:20)
you're gonna make something incredibly (35:18 - 35:22)
hard and tedious and understand that (35:20 - 35:25)
most of your players do not want to do (35:22 - 35:27)
that fifty excellent throws is your (35:25 - 35:30)
doing fifty excellent throws on a and (35:27 - 35:32)
you're making flying-type pokémon spawn (35:30 - 35:35)
which isn't like the best the easiest (35:32 - 35:37)
like if it was Poros wailmer and like (35:35 - 35:40)
nosepass oh I can get I can get fifty (35:37 - 35:41)
excellent throws in about 45 seconds (35:40 - 35:43)
like those Pokemon are so easy to (35:41 - 35:46)
excellent throw on but on like Pidgey (35:43 - 35:48)
and Taillow and hoot-hoot it's it's like (35:46 - 35:50)
a lot harder and I'm almost done with it (35:48 - 35:54)
Oh who's bragging now oh you knew he was (35:50 - 35:55)
in it for the bragging rights that's all (35:54 - 35:57)
this dude loops well I know I know it (35:55 - 36:02)
yeah we're gonna break too like I'm just (35:57 - 36:05)
gonna do a genetical of podcast lesions (36:02 - 36:09)
and an entire stream a stream audience (36:05 - 36:14)
who's like they hang on your missus this (36:09 - 36:16)
is what happens in this is what happens (36:14 - 36:17)
in my stream somebody will come in (36:16 - 36:20)
twitch.tv slash PKM and cast be the (36:17 - 36:21)
first time coming in and they'll be like (36:20 - 36:23)
do you shiny huh and I'll be like yeah (36:21 - 36:24)
yeah I do (36:23 - 36:26)
sure yeah okay I catch shadows every now (36:24 - 36:28)
and then I'm trying to be like be very (36:26 - 36:31)
humble about it so well what's your (36:28 - 36:32)
favorite and this is what happens what's (36:31 - 36:34)
your favorite this is the three this is (36:32 - 36:36)
the three hit combo that I get hit with (36:34 - 36:38)
every time it's jus shiny hunt what's (36:36 - 36:41)
your favorite chardy and then always (36:38 - 36:43)
always always it's how many Chinese do (36:41 - 36:45)
you have this is like the three hit (36:43 - 36:48)
combo that a new shiny hunter viewer (36:45 - 36:51)
comes into my stream so at this point (36:48 - 36:54)
I've just gotten like do you shiny hunt (36:51 - 36:56)
and I go yeah I have over 900 Chinese I (36:54 - 36:58)
just like here there's a lot (36:56 - 36:59)
we've knocked out two of the three (36:58 - 37:02)
questions right off the bat a my (36:59 - 37:04)
favorite bonus question which I've (37:02 - 37:06)
mentioned on the podcast before is how (37:04 - 37:08)
many did it take before you got the (37:06 - 37:16)
shiny now like I'm not counting clicker (37:08 - 37:20)
- like how many look it was like (37:16 - 37:22)
eighteen Venipede sir now that would (37:20 - 37:25)
have been three days sixty-five Venipede (37:22 - 37:28)
z' and mr. shiny showed up so kudos who (37:25 - 37:30)
cares I got the shiny Venipede without (37:28 - 37:35)
the long list of Herculean Labor's it (37:30 - 37:36)
doesn't count (37:35 - 37:38)
cuz you get it and then you can pop that (37:36 - 37:43)
in if you didn't suffer then why through (37:38 - 37:46)
400 different people coming in and (37:43 - 37:47)
saying I got it in one (37:46 - 37:50)
yeah I mean did you really catch four (37:47 - 37:54)
you really get that fair most in one (37:50 - 38:00)
encounter did you though or was it all a (37:54 - 38:01)
fake (38:00 - 38:03)
I think sometimes though people people (38:01 - 38:06)
put in perspective that like the longer (38:03 - 38:08)
the hunt is the more satisfying it is (38:06 - 38:11)
and that is not how I feel about no that (38:08 - 38:13)
is what you say not true I was ready to (38:11 - 38:16)
give up on that dag on Jupiter there's (38:13 - 38:20)
no amount of this took me 17 days that's (38:16 - 38:24)
fun after the first two hours yeah I (38:20 - 38:26)
would I would probably argue shoddy fare (38:24 - 38:28)
most is probably one of my most favorite (38:26 - 38:32)
ones kiss it's like zero work I just (38:28 - 38:34)
tapped a and then it appeared in that I (38:32 - 38:38)
caught it and then I I actually think I (38:34 - 38:39)
got a bunch of ribbons on it I think (38:38 - 38:42)
it's very ribbond up actually usually I (38:39 - 38:43)
say I usually catch a shoddy Pokemon (38:42 - 38:46)
that lives in a box forever but I'm on (38:43 - 38:48)
I'm on a RHIB admission at this point (38:46 - 38:50)
anyways (38:48 - 38:52)
I mean neotec comes out and says that (38:50 - 38:54)
you're not getting anything except (38:52 - 38:57)
bragging rights so if I mean I'm glad (38:54 - 38:59)
they said that because it was really my (38:57 - 39:03)
cue to say skippin yep here's the here's (38:59 - 39:05)
the question for you guys if it gave you (39:03 - 39:07)
like a little metal like next to your go (39:05 - 39:09)
fest metal would you be no more inclined (39:07 - 39:10)
to do it No (39:09 - 39:11)
nope nope nope I don't care about (39:10 - 39:13)
achievements I don't care about medals (39:11 - 39:16)
here's the thing they are virtual (39:13 - 39:18)
constancy and when this game dies (39:16 - 39:21)
they'll go away and generally the people (39:18 - 39:24)
who want to know are curious for two (39:21 - 39:26)
seconds and then the conversation moves (39:24 - 39:28)
on to other things it's not like I can (39:26 - 39:30)
have a throng of boys around me who are (39:28 - 39:33)
like oh let me see how your medals let (39:30 - 39:35)
us bring you grapes and wine for being (39:33 - 39:37)
so awesome now that happens it's like (39:35 - 39:38)
did you get it yeah cool and then you (39:37 - 39:41)
literally move on to anything else (39:38 - 39:42)
that's more interesting to talk about (39:41 - 39:45)
than a bunch of fake medals in virtual (39:42 - 39:47)
space so you're telling me you didn't (39:45 - 39:48)
update your LinkedIn profile with the (39:47 - 39:51)
message no cuz I actually might need to (39:48 - 39:56)
get a job I do like collecting the (39:51 - 39:58)
medals on a personal level like I like (39:56 - 40:01)
seeing how many Pokemon I've caught or (39:58 - 40:03)
like which events I've gone into but you (40:01 - 40:04)
you're right no one actually cares (40:03 - 40:06)
there's probably somebody out there (40:04 - 40:08)
you're a collector you like collecting (40:06 - 40:10)
oh yeah I do but I understand that my (40:08 - 40:13)
collection pleases me just like like the (40:10 - 40:15)
list of shiny pokemon I have they please (40:13 - 40:17)
me so when somebody's oh how many (40:15 - 40:19)
encounters did it take for you to get (40:17 - 40:22)
flabébé I don't remember I'm sure it's (40:19 - 40:24)
documented somewhere cuz I have a couple (40:22 - 40:27)
viewers that like to document my stuff (40:24 - 40:29)
but I was really excited I got the shiny (40:27 - 40:31)
white flabebe that was that was really (40:29 - 40:33)
cool but I don't I don't remember how (40:31 - 40:36)
long it took I don't even know where (40:33 - 40:37)
it's living right now I think it's still (40:36 - 40:42)
in Excel I would say I'm curious of (40:37 - 40:44)
Niantic will do more stuff like this but (40:42 - 40:45)
neotec has done so many one-off things (40:44 - 40:48)
where they're like here's something okay (40:45 - 40:54)
we forgot about it that you could do but (40:48 - 40:56)
I mean I'm fine with it because there (40:54 - 40:58)
are players where Pokemon go is like (40:56 - 41:00)
their thing it's their main thing it's (40:58 - 41:02)
almost their only thing give them a (41:00 - 41:05)
challenge good enjoy not for me and I (41:02 - 41:07)
don't feel bad that I'm not going for it (41:05 - 41:09)
that well it's just like destiny there (41:07 - 41:11)
are all those skins and and things that (41:09 - 41:14)
Steve you felt you needed to collect and (41:11 - 41:16)
get because it was the special (41:14 - 41:19)
packs exclusive dois fantastic whatever (41:16 - 41:23)
it literally has zero impact of my (41:19 - 41:23)
I will not worry a half-second about it (41:24 - 41:29)
I can't wait till I hit that point in (41:27 - 41:31)
life you could hit that point in life (41:29 - 41:35)
now there's nothing there is no barrier (41:31 - 41:38)
that is stopping you from not caring not (41:35 - 41:42)
caring is the easiest thing in the world (41:38 - 41:47)
now see he's not a gen Xer no you guys (41:42 - 41:50)
have like real jobs I play pokemon for a (41:47 - 41:54)
living I got it I'm still bound by some (41:50 - 41:56)

number going up and if I do knock them (43:33 - 43:35)
out (43:35 - 43:36)
then I can't tell if they have marks or (43:35 - 43:38)
not and I do like marked Pokemon because (43:36 - 43:40)
it's another thing to collect if I (43:38 - 43:42)

ever done hurry stuff in aisle of armor (43:54 - 43:59)
I'm a bit bum they didn't add new curry (43:57 - 44:01)
but kind of figured wait do we talk (43:59 - 44:04)
about the real issue wasn't real issue (44:01 - 44:08)
once again back to snapchat life I have (44:04 - 44:12)
literally maxed out the number of barrel (44:08 - 44:14)
you can grow for every possible berry (44:12 - 44:17)
and ultra Sun all Tremain (44:14 - 44:24)
I have 999 of every berry you can get is (44:17 - 44:31)
my flex yep I am I am captain Barry (44:24 - 44:33)
Farber (44:31 - 44:36)
I'm so sad because it's like everyday I (44:33 - 44:37)
had some berries to plant and some (44:36 - 44:39)
berries to grow and it's like nope (44:37 - 44:41)
you're done I can't even grow more of (44:39 - 44:44)
them because once you hit 999 it doesn't (44:41 - 44:45)
matter how many more you grow they don't (44:44 - 44:47)
want them they will keep them well you (44:45 - 44:49)
can dump what 100 in those containers (44:47 - 44:50)
and send them off on a you know (44:49 - 44:54)
adventures berries yeah those are the (44:50 - 44:57)
beans bean oh that's right (44:54 - 45:03)
the B mouth get rekt Pokemon appearing (44:57 - 45:05)

raids and in the wild (45:07 - 45:11)
jump sword art research is back this is (45:09 - 45:13)
actually really good so that means if (45:11 - 45:14)
you haven't played in a while if you (45:13 - 45:16)
missed last year's jump research it's (45:14 - 45:18)
the same exact jump start research but (45:16 - 45:21)
it is designed to give you a bunch of (45:18 - 45:23)
Stardust in XP and some encounters I (45:21 - 45:24)
think dratini is one of them Eevee is (45:23 - 45:26)
one of them I think the jump start is (45:24 - 45:27)
where you're guaranteed is trying to (45:26 - 45:30)
Eevee at the end and then take I believe (45:27 - 45:32)
you can take five snapshots a day to get (45:30 - 45:34)
fly at five flying peaches in your house (45:32 - 45:37)
by the time this podcast is up hoo will (45:34 - 45:39)

five gyms from my house I don't I (45:49 - 45:56)
complained about this before but the (45:52 - 45:58)
last time I complain about this I think (45:56 - 45:59)
was the clone Pokemon where I was like (45:58 - 46:01)
in packs and I saw like 400 gyms and I (45:59 - 46:03)
like never saw a Venus or spawn (46:01 - 46:05)
I only saw like Joe's aren't Blastoise (46:03 - 46:08)
this doesn't this doesn't benefit anyone (46:05 - 46:10)
except people in dis chords or Facebook (46:08 - 46:12)
groups and don't make stop making me do (46:10 - 46:14)
this mantak I don't want to join (46:12 - 46:16)
somebody's discord or Facebook to find a (46:14 - 46:18)
hoe oh just do what you're doing with (46:16 - 46:22)
Wednesday nights to say look trainers (46:18 - 46:25)
six o'clock Wednesday do it and then I (46:22 - 46:27)
don't have to coordinate with anyone I (46:25 - 46:28)
just know people will show up at 6:00 (46:27 - 46:31)
because you set the time the antic you (46:28 - 46:34)
can control this just say like hoo this (46:31 - 46:37)
weekend noon to 2:00 and then I know (46:34 - 46:39)
that I can go to a park with a bunch of (46:37 - 46:41)
gyms and I know ho-oh will spawn at noon (46:39 - 46:44)
and there will be people there just stop (46:41 - 46:46)
this randomness I hate it so much I (46:44 - 46:49)
don't want to use a discord I don't (46:46 - 46:50)
think I've ever told this on the podcast (46:49 - 46:52)
you know what the worst thing what the (46:50 - 46:54)
Milwaukee discord is ok here we go here (46:52 - 46:57)
it is though that one of the people the (46:54 - 47:00)
Milwaukee discord I'm sometimes you know (46:57 - 47:02)
I'm in a situation where I you know I (47:00 - 47:05)
see a group of people I can tell that (47:02 - 47:07)
they're nerdy enough that they're (47:05 - 47:08)
probably or they're boomer enough that (47:07 - 47:10)
they're playing Pokemon go so I pull (47:08 - 47:13)
over I'm like oh cool Giratina raid (47:10 - 47:15)
sweet I'll jump in this Giratina raid (47:13 - 47:16)
with these with these players (47:15 - 47:18)
there's always every time there's always (47:16 - 47:20)
like one person that's like very nice (47:18 - 47:21)
and they come over and they're like oh (47:20 - 47:23)
hey ba ba ba are you in the discord and (47:21 - 47:26)
I'm like yeah yeah I'm in the discord (47:23 - 47:28)
and here's the thing about the this is (47:26 - 47:30)
why when people come in they're like why (47:28 - 47:32)
did you just join a discord let me tell (47:30 - 47:35)
you about the Milwaukee discord the (47:32 - 47:38)
Milwaukee discord is is a ploy it's fake (47:35 - 47:42)
it doesn't it exists only for you to be (47:38 - 47:44)
judged because by being in the Milwaukee (47:42 - 47:47)
discord you're not in the real discord (47:44 - 47:49)
you have to join the Milwaukee discord (47:47 - 47:52)
and then there's a real discord that (47:49 - 47:55)
they will promote you to if they deem (47:52 - 47:59)
you worthy enough to participate and (47:55 - 48:01)
this sounds like Pokemon players right (47:59 - 48:02)
there (48:01 - 48:05)
so I was in the plea but discord this is (48:02 - 48:09)
the word of the day in the budget (48:05 - 48:12)
discord and I didn't say anything and (48:09 - 48:14)
everyone in that discord stays in that (48:12 - 48:16)
discord because they're not good enough (48:14 - 48:18)
to get moved into the good discord and (48:16 - 48:20)
let me tell you what I'm not doing in (48:18 - 48:22)
life I am NOT going to parade and dance (48:20 - 48:26)
around to to impress the gatekeeping (48:22 - 48:29)
better Milwaukee discord to earn the (48:26 - 48:32)
honor to get into the betterdiscord no (48:29 - 48:36)
no you can keep your Pokemon no discord (48:32 - 48:42)
I have a podcast and therefore should be (48:36 - 48:45)
moved to the upper echelons I shall not (48:42 - 48:46)
play by your rules (48:45 - 48:48)
I shall not go through your trials three (48:46 - 48:57)
may I say these three okay before like (48:48 - 48:59)
why'd you just join a discord Steve (48:57 - 49:02)
no I you don't understand how bad it is (48:59 - 49:05)
in the city but it's the same everywhere (49:02 - 49:07)
it is literally the same in DC and I (49:05 - 49:12)
swear if I had two words yes and this is (49:07 - 49:14)
the here's what's worse and I say I've (49:12 - 49:16)
heard it once I've heard it 50 times you (49:14 - 49:19)
hear the thing it's like well we had (49:16 - 49:22)
this like discord or Facebook group or (49:19 - 49:24)
something for our community and then one (49:22 - 49:28)
of the admins went bad and then like we (49:24 - 49:30)
had to ban that admin but then they (49:28 - 49:32)
started another discord and all these (49:30 - 49:34)
other people who were sympathetic to (49:32 - 49:36)
them went over to that discord so now (49:34 - 49:39)
all the groups are split and nobody (49:36 - 49:40)
likes each other and we can't show up in (49:39 - 49:42)
this and I'm like well okay when do we (49:40 - 49:44)

anything from this podcast you remember (51:40 - 51:44)

wrong but it says right there well it's (52:53 - 52:56)
because you don't have a meta team I (52:55 - 53:00)

from like the developers or like us a (53:00 - 53:04)
bunch of suckers here hopefully it won't (53:02 - 53:06)
take too much of their time and then the (53:04 - 53:09)
copywriter forgot to delete this line (53:06 - 53:13)

what this line is supposed to like make (53:13 - 53:15)
you feel (53:15 - 53:20)
besides pure hatred and anger thanks for (53:15 - 53:22)
flying Pokemon go hopefully it doesn't (53:20 - 53:25)

challenge will ask you to make make you (53:50 - 53:55)

your fellow trainers send gifts to (53:55 - 54:00)
friends don't forget to attach stickers (53:58 - 54:03)
it might make your face get anything for (54:00 - 54:05)
attaching stickers besides the happiness (54:03 - 54:09)
of enjoy being rude to us by saying (54:05 - 54:11)
violet I (54:09 - 54:13)
he never sends me any gift so that's why (54:11 - 54:15)
I sent you a gift last night at 2:00 (54:13 - 54:18)
a.m. we'll okay sure I didn't notice any (54:15 - 54:20)
sticker on it I don't think I said just (54:18 - 54:22)
I was out of buy stickers I only had hi (54:20 - 54:27)
stickers wait we haven't talked about (54:22 - 54:28)
stickers what do you guys feel about (54:27 - 54:32)
stickers they're dumb okay I enjoyed (54:28 - 54:37)
sending them to this special you have to (54:32 - 54:39)
either have to buy them or randomly get (54:37 - 54:42)
them from gifts and the random ones are (54:39 - 54:44)
often things like why would I send this (54:42 - 54:48)
to anybody this sticker is dumb oh I've (54:44 - 54:50)
never noticed like because Chris Covanta (54:48 - 54:52)
always sends me like one of like two (54:50 - 54:54)
Pokemon hugging each other and like (54:52 - 54:55)
where did he get that one cuz I'm sure (54:54 - 54:56)
he ain't buying those stickers (54:55 - 54:59)
I mean they're really cheap I mean I'm (54:56 - 55:00)
not saying you should buy them but (54:59 - 55:01)
they're I mean you want to talk about (55:00 - 55:02)
cheap we could talk about Chris go (55:01 - 55:09)
Vontae there's a Pikachu oh right you (55:02 - 55:11)
hugging each other and it's you can get (55:09 - 55:13)
30 stickers for 80 cents it's pretty (55:11 - 55:13)
cheap (55:13 - 55:16)
the last thinkers it's a lot of stickers (55:13 - 55:19)
that do nothing again it's virtual (55:16 - 55:22)
stickers send me really [ __ ] joy they (55:19 - 55:25)
spread joy I mixed your friend (55:22 - 55:28)
they spend joy if your friend is it (55:25 - 55:30)
sending ones that are rude like a bi (55:28 - 55:33)
ayyi but if they if they had a mechanic (55:30 - 55:36)
okay so we just spent like 40 minutes (55:33 - 55:38)
talking about min max errs and how they (55:36 - 55:41)
like use their Twitter to brag about how (55:38 - 55:45)
many how many ex peas they have but I (55:41 - 55:49)
think there is something nice about a (55:45 - 55:51)
meaningless mechanic that you don't have (55:49 - 55:54)
to care about that is still like I don't (55:51 - 55:56)
know what somebody sends me a bi sticker (55:54 - 55:57)
I think I laugh every time cuz I think (55:56 - 56:00)
it's so dumb yeah pretty much (55:57 - 56:04)
actually I number one I will say I (56:00 - 56:07)
everytime Pat from Chicago sends me a (56:04 - 56:10)
sticker it makes me smile I find is that (56:07 - 56:13)
oh yeah he could chew on I was like why (56:10 - 56:15)
I was pretty good I like angry why is it (56:13 - 56:21)
mad like okay so I saw a thread being (56:15 - 56:22)
like if you send somebody a sticker it (56:21 - 56:24)
should it should increase your (56:22 - 56:27)
lucky chance or whatever I'm already (56:24 - 56:29)
lucky friends with everybody I can be (56:27 - 56:31)
lucky friends with what don't waste my (56:29 - 56:33)
time but the second they add a mechanic (56:31 - 56:34)
to the stickers then you have to care (56:33 - 56:37)
about the stickers and sometimes it's (56:34 - 56:39)
just nice to like if you don't like the (56:37 - 56:41)
stickers then you're not missing out (56:39 - 56:43)
anything you're literally not losing (56:41 - 56:43)
anything (56:43 - 56:46)
what if they add a mechanic like Oh more (56:43 - 56:50)
lucky friends or double the then all of (56:46 - 56:51)
a sudden you have to care about it and (56:50 - 56:54)
that would be like something would be (56:51 - 56:57)
worse sometimes video games just have (56:54 - 56:59)
dumb things it's like the same reason (56:57 - 57:02)
why you buy a like a far fetch hat in (56:59 - 57:04)
the game it doesn't do anything it (57:02 - 57:05)
doesn't like increase your chance to get (57:04 - 57:08)
far-fetched but it's still like I I like (57:05 - 57:09)
this far fetch hat it makes me happy (57:08 - 57:12)
it's 2 bucks what is $2 nothing like and (57:09 - 57:15)
so I think the stickers do do you like I (57:12 - 57:18)
hope they don't actually add a mechanic (57:15 - 57:19)
to them cuz I don't want to actually (57:18 - 57:21)
worry about them but I don't think (57:19 - 57:22)
they're but I don't think they're bad (57:21 - 57:25)
sometimes games just need to have dumb (57:22 - 57:27)
fun things and I think hate me antek (57:25 - 57:29)
added something that it's like not (57:27 - 57:31)
another mechanic that I have to worry (57:29 - 57:34)
about I just it the only thing that like (57:31 - 57:39)
they just make them just put them in the (57:34 - 57:41)
game like don't charge for them is this (57:39 - 57:43)
another this is another thing they're (57:41 - 57:45)
charging for look Niantic can't make (57:43 - 57:51)
money by not charging everything I think (57:45 - 57:53)
of it in like a postcard sense like you (57:51 - 57:55)
can like every time I get like fancy (57:53 - 57:57)
postcards from Andrew or any other (57:55 - 58:00)
people they like I can't I guess I ever (57:57 - 58:03)
sent me any fancy post parents look what (58:00 - 58:05)
they gotta update your LinkedIn profile (58:03 - 58:10)
with what send me postcards but you've (58:05 - 58:11)
probably have gotten postcards where (58:10 - 58:13)
people like attach stickers to the (58:11 - 58:16)
postcard or to the envelope and then I (58:13 - 58:18)
think well that was a waste of a sticker (58:16 - 58:20)
wait why are they put in a postcard in (58:18 - 58:22)
an envelope that is like I said Posey (58:20 - 58:27)
repeats or envelopes hmm or it's that (58:22 - 58:29)
sticky that wishy washy tape I don't (58:27 - 58:32)
know what's called where people (58:29 - 58:34)
wishy-washy to yeah it's like that what (58:32 - 58:36)
he's talking about the man has gone over (58:34 - 58:38)
these literally lost my mind this up (58:36 - 58:41)
there's a the if you go to like craft (58:38 - 58:44)
stores or specifically like everywhere (58:41 - 58:46)
in Japan because they're obsessed with (58:44 - 58:48)
stationery in Japan there's like this (58:46 - 58:51)
tape and like they usually have a little (58:48 - 58:52)
well then the Pokemon centers have (58:51 - 58:54)
Pokemon tape they have like little (58:52 - 58:56)
Pikachu Jean or a little dittos and like (58:54 - 58:58)
you use the tape to like seal the (58:56 - 58:59)
envelope I don't know what's called (58:58 - 59:01)
wishy washy tape is what I call it that (58:59 - 59:04)
sounds that sounds like very Asian (59:01 - 59:06)
because like licking an envelope is too (59:04 - 59:06)
dirty (59:06 - 59:09)
yeah probably no I haven't licked an (59:06 - 59:11)
envelope since 2000 since they made (59:09 - 59:14)
self-sticking envelopes that's true I (59:11 - 59:16)
always I always will pay the extra like (59:14 - 59:19)
40 cents to get the self sealing I just (59:16 - 59:22)
use an artificial tongue it's not either (59:19 - 59:24)
way the only postcards I ever get are (59:22 - 59:28)
from Gregg's other podcast and there's (59:24 - 59:31)
never any stickers on there so step it (59:28 - 59:34)
up it is called washi tape and I think (59:31 - 59:37)
to myself why would I buy washi tape (59:34 - 59:39)
when envelopes are already self sealing (59:37 - 59:43)
but I will say when somebody sends me an (59:39 - 59:45)
envelope with washi tape and stickers I (59:43 - 59:47)
go oh that's cute I would never spend (59:45 - 59:50)
that money but I can appreciate that so (59:47 - 59:52)
that's what I was cute that's what I (59:50 - 59:54)
would come to yeah yeah my friends my (59:52 - 60:00)
friends clearly a sucker that's how I (59:54 - 60:03)
also compare stickers in Pokemon go like (60:00 - 60:06)
I am happy to get them but I go boy (60:03 - 60:08)
they're a sucker for spending 80 cents (60:06 - 60:11)
on this now I know who to sell this (60:08 - 60:14)
bridge to I just got a random shiny (60:11 - 60:17)
Turtwig and go hey it's not bragging (60:14 - 60:21)
yeah bragging rights denier I got (60:17 - 60:26)
LinkedIn I don't think I've updated my (60:21 - 60:29)
LinkedIn in five years that's a problem (60:26 - 60:31)
you gonna put all your Pokemon a (60:29 - 60:33)
compliment accomplishments on it that's (60:31 - 60:34)
why and I get a job at the Pokemon (60:33 - 60:37)

organizations around the world receiving (64:25 - 64:30)
funds from the Pokemon company group (64:28 - 64:32)

Pokemon go fest more organizations will (64:34 - 64:39)
be added once confirmed all right so (64:36 - 64:42)

Asia to events children's rights and (65:22 - 65:27)
equality for girls I don't know how to (65:25 - 65:31)
say this unic efe UNICEF Onis join a (65:27 - 65:34)
child in the 70 or 80 s did you not (65:31 - 65:37)
collect coins for UNICEF now that we (65:34 - 65:41)
know ho I have me more every live a box (65:37 - 65:44)
well tell you you get up you get a (65:41 - 65:46)
little cardboard box Bank thing okay (65:44 - 65:48)
school and then you put your Valentine's (65:46 - 65:51)
Day cards in it no no this is from (65:48 - 65:55)
Halloween on Halloween you go around to (65:51 - 65:58)
get candy and then you'd hold out your (65:55 - 66:01)
UNICEF UNICEF box and make them feel (65:58 - 66:03)
guilty and then they would dig through (66:01 - 66:05)
the purse to give you pennies and dump (66:03 - 66:08)
them in there United Nations (66:05 - 66:09)
International children's education fund (66:08 - 66:12)
or you did what I did never put the box (66:09 - 66:15)
together put it in a folder and probably (66:12 - 66:17)
figure out about it yeah no I like the (66:15 - 66:21)
70s yes yes I never heard of that (66:17 - 66:24)
the last charity on this list is World (66:21 - 66:26)
Vision which I also have never heard of (66:24 - 66:28)
sponsor a child (66:26 - 66:30)
World Vision international oh is that (66:28 - 66:32)
what that is (66:30 - 66:33)
World Vision International is an (66:32 - 66:36)
evangelical Christian humanitarian aid (66:33 - 66:38)
and development and AGA's AG advocacy (66:36 - 66:42)
group that does stuff I mean there's no (66:38 - 66:44)
doubt that children are a big part of (66:42 - 66:48)
the Pokemon companies audience they (66:44 - 66:51)
believe that children are the future but (66:48 - 66:53)
also I agree with them that most adults (66:51 - 66:55)
are a lost cause at this point so you (66:53 - 66:58)
may invest in children some of my best (66:55 - 67:00)
friends are adults thank you very much (66:58 - 67:02)
I have adult friends nobody say most of (67:00 - 67:04)
them are probably a lost cause (67:02 - 67:07)
well I'm sure after go fest I'm sure (67:04 - 67:08)
we'll get another update (67:07 - 67:10)
I'm sure by then they'll they'll donate (67:08 - 67:11)
the money and I'll probably have their (67:10 - 67:14)
final list of charities probably by the (67:11 - 67:16)
end of the month five million dollars a (67:14 - 67:17)
lot well ten million dollars if you (67:16 - 67:17)
count (67:17 - 67:20)
yeah I'm antic it's a lot of money well (67:17 - 67:22)
and that's the minimum right they could (67:20 - 67:23)
they could surprise us and be like we (67:22 - 67:26)
donated 25 Millions true I'm sure one of (67:23 - 67:28)
their accountants is running the numbers (67:26 - 67:30)
of what the minimum donation is okay (67:28 - 67:32)
there accountants out of it cuz I (67:30 - 67:34)
strings are going to say don't don't no (67:32 - 67:38)
donations no Fiscal Responsibility (67:34 - 67:41)
Countians don't know how to have fun (67:38 - 67:42)
[Laughter] (67:41 - 67:45)
some of them do (67:42 - 67:47)
they do so duco and other number based (67:45 - 67:51)
fun things okay fun is a matter of (67:47 - 67:53)
perspective much like Pokemon engagement (67:51 - 67:55)
rings (67:53 - 67:57)
Greg give us our Pokemon of the week (67:55 - 68:03)
actually not Greg's job oh sorry because (67:57 - 68:06)
of the week okay ready (68:03 - 68:09)
uh-huh it's fun to ask the question of (68:06 - 68:12)
the week it's fun to ask the question of (68:09 - 68:16)
the week you can take cup foo into a (68:12 - 68:21)
Shifu and give it its favorite meal so (68:16 - 68:30)
from The Simpsons no you're a bad bad (68:21 - 68:33)
Chris says in Pokemon sword and shield (68:30 - 68:35)
expansion past announcement it appears (68:33 - 68:37)
that the aisle of armor is to the east (68:35 - 68:40)
of Galler the crown Tundra is the south (68:37 - 68:41)
do you think they'll announce another (68:40 - 68:43)
expansion well they will let you explore (68:41 - 68:45)
other new areas to the north and to the (68:43 - 68:46)
west it's a pretty good question (68:45 - 68:51)
actually so how is that possible a crown (68:46 - 68:53)
under supposed to be cold (68:51 - 68:56)
how can it be south that's foolishness (68:53 - 69:00)
the south is cold South Pole (68:56 - 69:05)
not in gallery rally we don't know what (69:00 - 69:08)
Galler is yeah but when you go on the (69:05 - 69:10)
routes you don't get to frosty cold land (69:08 - 69:12)
until you're up at the top in the north (69:10 - 69:17)
but you're assuming that's north oh dear (69:12 - 69:17)
we'll find out maybe there's a snow (69:20 - 69:25)
problem that's happening in the south (69:23 - 69:26)
and that's why we're there exploring (69:25 - 69:29)
it's all the snowmen all the cold in the (69:26 - 69:35)
north hmm forced to leave their tundra (69:29 - 69:38)
island okay I'll say two things one I (69:35 - 69:40)
think it would be great to explore new (69:38 - 69:43)
areas because so far like the areas that (69:40 - 69:45)
they're doing I think the bigger (69:43 - 69:47)
question is do we think that they won't (69:45 - 69:50)
have a game next year that they want to (69:47 - 69:53)
that they'll want to promote like isn't (69:50 - 69:55)
if a new game isn't coming out and they (69:53 - 69:57)
really think we want to extend the shelf (69:55 - 70:00)
life of sword and shield then no like (69:57 - 70:02)
we're not gonna get them but if there's (70:00 - 70:03)
not a new game coming out or it's not (70:02 - 70:07)
coming out until November then I could (70:03 - 70:08)
see them doing a north and west (70:07 - 70:10)
I think the likelihood if any more DLC (70:08 - 70:14)
is not not likely (70:10 - 70:17)
now I don't see it happening yeah I (70:14 - 70:19)
don't know if I see more do you see (70:17 - 70:21)
happening either I feel like the content (70:19 - 70:23)
we got in may be something people were (70:21 - 70:25)
to disagree with me but I feel like the (70:23 - 70:27)
content and the isle of armor is enough (70:25 - 70:30)
to is enough that I felt like a third (70:27 - 70:31)
version right the only difference is (70:30 - 70:33)
they like spread it out in between the (70:31 - 70:34)
game so it's like you're doing the same (70:33 - 70:37)
first two gyms and then you get a little (70:34 - 70:39)
bit of something new and then you're (70:37 - 70:40)
doing the next three gyms and they're (70:39 - 70:41)
getting a little bit of something new (70:40 - 70:42)
and then all of a sudden you're doing (70:41 - 70:45)
rainbow rocket and then you're like yeah (70:42 - 70:46)
I guess that was enough that was worth (70:45 - 70:49)
$40 but it was better than the last game (70:46 - 70:51)
but only cause it had more content but (70:49 - 70:55)
to me I feel like the crown tundra is (70:51 - 70:58)
going to be like be in what do they call (70:55 - 71:02)
it Nora's the the Hoopoe rings yeah yeah (70:58 - 71:05)
I mean they were the the portals to (71:02 - 71:08)
bring in legendary yeah and then grouper (71:05 - 71:11)
rings and ultrasound alternators the (71:08 - 71:13)
wormholes so (71:11 - 71:16)
I don't know if there will be this like (71:13 - 71:17)
grand story that some people are (71:16 - 71:19)
expecting I don't think so I think it'll (71:17 - 71:20)
be another like two to three hour story (71:19 - 71:24)
and then it will be here are a bunch of (71:20 - 71:26)
ways to catch legendary Pokemon which is (71:24 - 71:29)
like exactly what the end of Omega Ruby (71:26 - 71:31)
and the end of ultra Sun altra moon was (71:29 - 71:33)
was like yep here's a bunch of legendary (71:31 - 71:36)
Pokemon and you're done and if you don't (71:33 - 71:39)
want to buy it you don't you don't get (71:36 - 71:41)
these legendary Pokemon so do you think (71:39 - 71:44)
like this year is the end of sword and (71:41 - 71:46)
shield like they just don't know what (71:44 - 71:48)
they do after it like what else couldn't (71:46 - 71:51)
they add well it's not the end because (71:48 - 71:52)
they're gonna have to have events and (71:51 - 71:54)
everything like that but I don't think (71:52 - 71:56)
they're going to be doing any kind of (71:54 - 71:59)
full-size DLC now but this is the (71:56 - 72:02)
problem - right like if they if they if (71:59 - 72:04)
Crown tundra comes out in November and (72:02 - 72:08)
then they announce a new game let's just (72:04 - 72:10)
say for talking points let's just say (72:08 - 72:14)
their Gen 4 remakes in and in January or (72:10 - 72:16)
February I mean like I don't really care (72:14 - 72:19)
what they do so if they announce a (72:16 - 72:22)
remake and they're like ok you know (72:19 - 72:25)
let's look at the patterns here we'll (72:22 - 72:28)
put Dyna maxing into Gen 4 because it's (72:25 - 72:30)
part of the same gen and then you know (72:28 - 72:33)
you can get other Pokemon you're missing (72:30 - 72:35)
from the Pokedex that comes out in (72:33 - 72:37)
November so what what do you want what (72:35 - 72:39)
do you want your trainers to do for a (72:37 - 72:42)
year like almost the year the same thing (72:39 - 72:44)
that we used to do in like 2014 and 2015 (72:42 - 72:46)
when Game Freak took a year off just (72:44 - 72:52)
enjoy the game we have I wouldn't I (72:46 - 72:54)
wouldn't hate it if they did it I agree (72:52 - 72:57)
I don't think it's very likely but III I (72:54 - 73:00)
think it's more likely if they don't (72:57 - 73:02)
have a solid solid plan for what's (73:00 - 73:04)
happening next year cuz things right now (73:02 - 73:08)
are a little wonky like a pretty big (73:04 - 73:10)
explosion of people being very excited (73:08 - 73:12)
for the DLC and pretty happy with it and (73:10 - 73:14)
then they just all kind of fell off the (73:12 - 73:17)
face of the earth I'm still loving it (73:14 - 73:19)
still playing it every day like playing (73:17 - 73:20)
the game (73:19 - 73:21)
Bobby I mean I'm still playing it every (73:20 - 73:23)
day because I'm there's still a bunch of (73:21 - 73:26)
things I need to do but most Pokemon (73:23 - 73:27)
fans they (73:26 - 73:28)
consume the content and then they move (73:27 - 73:30)
to other games and there's nothing wrong (73:28 - 73:32)
with that but they consume the content (73:30 - 73:34)
in like a weekend and then they went (73:32 - 73:35)
back to Animal Crossing cuz Animal (73:34 - 73:37)
Crossing had an update or they went to (73:35 - 73:40)
whatever other new game is coming out I (73:37 - 73:41)
don't even know what games came out (73:40 - 73:42)
recently I'm sure there's a bunch (73:41 - 73:45)
there's a remake of Tony Hawk coming out (73:42 - 73:47)
eventually (73:45 - 73:47)
at least with like a third version (73:47 - 73:53)
you're forcing your trainers to shrug (73:50 - 73:56)
like slaw through all that content again (73:53 - 74:00)
just to see the new stuff not I and I (73:56 - 74:01)
don't think that's better (74:00 - 74:03)
I think this I think the DLC part is (74:01 - 74:06)
better like I don't need to play through (74:03 - 74:08)
the game I've already played through (74:06 - 74:10)
four times to see the new content I do (74:08 - 74:13)
think it's better but it's just like a (74:10 - 74:15)
thing that Pokemon fans I feel like are (74:13 - 74:17)
not used to but I don't okay I don't (74:15 - 74:19)
know what they would be able to add in a (74:17 - 74:22)
future DLC that isn't just more Pokemon (74:19 - 74:25)
another wild area another two-hour story (74:22 - 74:29)
and mega Pokemon dens a couple users I (74:25 - 74:31)
mean just like you seed that this is why (74:29 - 74:33)
you don't work for the Pope yeah but (74:31 - 74:37)
because you're efficient it's gonna be a (74:33 - 74:39)
glare and spaceport that takes us to (74:37 - 74:42)
another Pokemon planet though in the (74:39 - 74:44)
north you can build secret bases and (74:42 - 74:46)

the week alright so last week's Pokemon (75:19 - 75:27)
was I didn't try very hard that was part (75:23 - 75:29)
of the problem oh goodness I lost the (75:27 - 75:31)
text what was it was a limited (75:29 - 75:33)
distribution for a certain time period (75:31 - 75:36)
it's a very forgettable pokemon nobody (75:33 - 75:40)
ever wants to use it I didn't say it in (75:36 - 75:41)
the (75:40 - 75:44)
in the dealy but it was in a movie (75:41 - 75:46)
because I think that's like the only (75:44 - 75:50)
reason existed was to be in the movie (75:46 - 75:54)
what else do we have here it is the last (75:50 - 75:56)
Pokemon in the central Kailas pokedex (75:54 - 75:58)
even though it was distributed when the (75:56 - 76:00)
Hoenn region was the primary region and (75:58 - 76:01)
one month before we all started (76:00 - 76:03)
exploring all ola there you go that's (76:01 - 76:05)
the only clue you need who is that (76:03 - 76:06)
Pokemon (76:05 - 76:13)
it's how could you get wishy-washy (76:06 - 76:15)
before we started exploring Aloha (76:13 - 76:19)
dude it's your Pearl player with your (76:15 - 76:24)
pro hacker leet hacker I wrote down (76:19 - 76:29)
Genesis it's volcanion volcanium was the (76:24 - 76:32)
last X&Y Pokemon (76:29 - 76:37)
Wow yeah that's a bad Pokemon yeah I (76:32 - 76:39)
mean I wasn't paying attention and I (76:37 - 76:42)
forgot about it but I mean I mean the (76:39 - 76:45)
main clue was that we discussed it in (76:42 - 76:46)
the program when it was discovered (76:45 - 76:50)
through a datum and we're all like oh (76:46 - 76:52)
this is cool it's the first ever water (76:50 - 76:54)
fire pokemon and then by the time it (76:52 - 76:56)
finally came out we were like nope do (76:54 - 77:00)
you care about that movie was awful (76:56 - 77:01)
yeah that movie did not do that Pokemon (77:00 - 77:05)
justice silly trivia is the only fire (77:01 - 77:10)
water pokemon Wow (77:05 - 77:10)
has a decent shuffle I can't like I (77:10 - 77:18)
don't know it could be better (77:16 - 77:21)
Chinese real good though (77:18 - 77:24)
well how do you shiny hunter volcania (77:21 - 77:26)
and they're probably shiny large yeah (77:24 - 77:29)
but the one that they have on mobile (77:26 - 77:32)
videos real sweet all right so this (77:29 - 77:34)
week's Pokemon of the week is we're (77:32 - 77:36)
gonna get weird oh boy (77:34 - 77:42)
but I'm guarantee Greg will go this one (77:36 - 77:45)
no pressure within the boundaries of (77:42 - 77:47)
Minneapolis there are numerous lakes (77:45 - 77:49)
with three of the largest being Lake of (77:47 - 77:52)
the Isles today Makovsky which is really (77:49 - 77:55)
hard to say and Lake Harriet when riding (77:52 - 77:57)
my bike around the city I most (77:55 - 77:59)
frequently circle one or two of these (77:57 - 78:02)
lakes depending on my mood that day all (77:59 - 78:05)
three lakes are popular gathering places (78:02 - 78:06)
for the people of the city who (78:05 - 78:08)
frequently engage in walking running (78:06 - 78:10)
bathing sunbathing or even bike riding (78:08 - 78:13)
if I were you I would have more (78:10 - 78:15)
knowledge of each lakes ecology and (78:13 - 78:17)
geological development I would know what (78:15 - 78:19)
the human impacts on the lake wildlife (78:17 - 78:21)
are and how that could best be managed (78:19 - 78:25)
it's been real bad okay if I were me I (78:21 - 78:27)
would feel strongly about each Lakes (78:25 - 78:30)
place in Minneapolis society I would get (78:27 - 78:33)
sentimental about the sunrise over Lake (78:30 - 78:35)
Harriet I would care about the (78:33 - 78:38)
well-being of people visiting the lakes (78:35 - 78:41)
ultimately though I am US and I have the (78:38 - 78:43)
willpower to choose each day which Lake (78:41 - 78:45)
to visit which Lake I will circle on my (78:43 - 78:48)
bike as I pursue exercise and fresh air (78:45 - 78:51)
ultimately willpower is having both (78:48 - 78:53)
choice and the willingness to make a (78:51 - 78:55)
decision in Minneapolis there are no (78:53 - 78:58)
Guardians to keep us from the lakes sea (78:55 - 79:02)
that's so easy I'm sure everybody's just (78:58 - 79:04)
