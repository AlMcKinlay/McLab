[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 416 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your hostess bj with me Gregg hello welcome to the midpoint of the year you're gonna want to stock up on super potions some paralyzed heels the gyms are only gonna get harder after this point you're just at the halfway point we'll also here I have a Pokemon dilemma I need some assistance resolving so wisdom and insight Gregg you should know what the problem is the end of the show this is not Pokemon of the week this is Pokemon problem of the day okay alright my shiny Venipede showed up about 4 months before I was expecting it and I'm not ready to start shining hunting my next bug wait what game did you even see this is how you and I just do not relate because yet not on snapchat I've been doing bug shiny hunts on snapchat every let me not use an expletive day for probably the past two and a half years gram influencer TV which is Facebook Garbo TV is not the place to be nah so the issue is I was most likely thinking that my final because this will be my final bug too shiny hunt was gonna be snow slash frost moth but my buddy Josh here in Minneapolis is a huge slacker and has not given me the Pokemon I need to complete my pokedex he was gonna give me the shield exclusives so that I could get that shiny charm so I without no shiny charm I'm not shiny hunting in Pokemon sword and I don't want to play pokemon shield because I was gonna have a shiny bug team for Pokemon shield what's the answer shield player I was literally there yesterday I know I it's just like I was trying to Josh was like I'll hook you up dude and I was like okay Josh let's do it hey who is this Josh person they are unreliable the well obviously that has a bit of proven point he cute though [Music] even more unreliable you know cute boys are unreliable I found that I could learn that lesson not actually not on my LinkedIn profile do i brag that I'm level forty times two but I also have a complete man okay mom sword and shield Dex and I love armor Dex see but the thing is like if I get Pokemon from you guys it's it's like not trying I like I want to kind of like share my experience with the community I want I want to be my friendships with other 20 20 there's no trying anymore there's getting by it's just taking the port in the storm what do you own you miss a nice cue I'm swimming in ice cubes I I need ice cue curse what else is a shield exclusive Aventa yeah well I mean do you need that for the shiny charm yeah yeah oh dang I need to touch trade on that got it I got it I got them all I think shield has Sableye because I think sword has Maul well oh anything that can breed I gave it there there is where I gave up hope and I started my own that's fine I mean if you guys want to hook me up then then we'll seal the deal and I'll start shining huntin on them snows well speaking of hooking up let's accuse me yes we finished re harmony conversation before the spot kiss may ever have speaking of hooking up this is off the verge calm Pokemon engagement ring has gone terribly wrong that's true yeah are we allowed this was sent in by Stuart in our slack channel before we talked about this engagement ring we got a lot of Pokemon go news this week and we have some video game slash TCG championship stuff going for currently and then getting ready for the 2021 season which who knows if there will even be a 2021 at this right that's that's the that's the show Japanese jewelry company Ginza Tanaka is selling Pikachu inspired rings this is a partnership with the Pokemon company these are not knock offerings for couples looking to make their marriage themed there are two concepts here they run roughly a hundred and fifteen thousand to three hundred and forty six thousand yen which translates to about one thousand to three thousand dollars it's a Pikachu head emblem with I choose u graved inside of the band and one is like the Pikachu head and then one is like the two pikachu tails that's it that's that's all there is to the story I guess the transition was better than the story the punk about ring is good they've done plenty of jewelry before yes this is like not really a shock I think actually if you were to go on to Pokemon Center comm they have a they have rings they have anywhere between like a hundred one hundred fifty dollar rings they have $80 earrings they have two hundred dollar bracelets I'm sure there's somebody out there that really wants to it once a Pikachu wedding ring for a thousand dollars I'm sure that person exists I'm sure they will be very happy I don't know as much as I love Pokemon I don't know if I need my entire life Pokemon doubt I mean this spring is only gone terribly wrong from a matter of perspective some of us perfectly fine it's perfectly fine yeah Megan from the verge really really not into this ring well then it's not for her Megan move on also I just think the ears would hurt after a while yeah Heidi you'd have to either wear it away from your knuckle so that you weren't constantly digging those ears into your hand or I don't know what you're gonna do hmm yeah cuz if you yeah if you like bend your fingers back then yeah hmm like either either way there's no there's no hand model here well somebody called slep Seinfeld from 25 years ago and let's go with the joke oh yeah there was a hand model joking that no I'm just spouting nonsense you don't stop I will say that this is not the first time they've done wedding stuff they had a complete wedding thing last year I'm assuming what they do is they probably make a limited supply of these they sell out and then they go well it's wedding season again what do we have in the pipeline that we could produce but last year when I was in Japan they did have the they didn't have wedding stuff I think they even had it where you could actually pay for an entire Pokemon themed wedding specifically in Japan where Pikachu would show up they did have wedding stuff at the Pokemon centers and I read and I little wedding flutes like champagne flutes yeah champagne blue not musical flutes right instrument and one had like misses and then I had the female Pikachu and the one said missed her and I had a male Pikachu obviously that doesn't work for any gay couples but for the standard male/female Pikachu couple well I guess maybe you could just buy two of them and then you have two misters or two misses but then you got to figure out where to do with the other anyways besides that we do have these these Pikachu flutes I think they were like oh gosh they're probably like 60 bucks the package like there's a I mean you're paying because they slap the word wedding on it and they're they're paying off your emotions at that point but I like them a lot we've never used them they're in our cabinet and the fancy box have you ever used them I think we're gonna use them on the first year thingy yeah the anniversary Dealey look I read and I hung out on our anniversary and then we were like should we bust up the champagne flutes that we were both like now let's go to bed hung out on our anniversary ready the downward slide begins romance is dead in this country I can't be bothered to get my pika shoot two champagne flutes this is not specifically Pokemon news but the podcast Awards podcast Awards com are open from now until July 31st I did throw our little old podcast into the Hat you had to pay to throw yourself into the head I think they're the problem that they've expressed is podcast will get nominated and win and then those podcasts will not care about winning hmm so then they would get a trophy made for somebody who has no interest in winning it's just their fans voted for them and in order to even get nominated the podcast has to pay an entry fee it's not that much it was like I think like 50 bucks or something and then you will go onto the list so that way podcast who do not care about winning do not win well they don't get entered for consideration right yes so we are entered for consideration I believe there are fifteen or twenty gaming podcasts they will only take the top ten to the finals so if you would like to help out do the nomination I timed it it takes about 60 seconds you do have to make an account but you go to podcast Awards calm you click the big button that says click me you make your account and then you can wear under the gaming section there is a bunch of other podcasts under different fields if you want to vote you don't have to vote for them you could just vote for gaming but I will probably remind you guys every episode so the $50.00 doesn't completely go to waste but I really think we could actually win this year I think between our slack and our discord and the twitch and all our podcast listeners I think we have a pretty decent audience when we tried this I think we tried this geez like seven years ago so I think I think we got a pretty good chance of winning I can't tell you who are really competing against cuz I don't know what the final ten people will be but they don't think something like giant bomb or the instance I don't think they care about this kind of stuff anymore so I don't think we have to worry about those juggernauts that exist in the gaming space so podcast Awards comm if you want help out with that okay do you want to do pokemon ghost stuff or do you want to do video game championship stuff hmm game championship first cuz that's why I tuned in and then I can just tune right on out for Pokemon go okay cool this up Pokemon calm this is the 2020 Pokemon video game championship VGC format rules they have changed because of aisle of armor the following Pokemon are now now permitted using the official video game championship format pokemon in the Iowa aisle of armor pokedex including cup foo and uh Shifu are now permitted Blastoise Venusaur Rilla boom cinder ace intel ian and earth shook Giganta max factor permit i don't know why they said jeanette checking its max factor and not Giganta max form maybe that's actually what you call it are permitted the jerk it's max factor KO Balian taarakian and Virizion are also permitted they don't exist in the isle of armor but i guess hey you can use them if you want and well yet i mean i'm sure they'll get added in at some point yeah i'm i'm sure they're part of the crown Tundra with probably every other legendary pokemon pokemon with the battle-ready symbol that would otherwise be eligible for competition are permitted now we talked about this I think two weeks ago we'll talk about it again and you might be asking like why can you use cabal a Interac and Virizion if you cannot catch them in past official competitions you have to while at least in certain shield you have to use Pokemon with the sword and shield symbol just like in Sun and Moon you would have to use them with the I think Sun and Moon was like the Pentagon symbol and then X&Y was the clover symbol sure sword and shield it looks like kind of a pokeball with a swish through it but anyways that when even if you did not purchase isle of armor when you did the update to a dial of our mark there's a dude in the Rose tower that just suddenly appears he's just standing by the elevator you talked to him he will take any of your old Pokemon and he will make them battle-ready meaning if you caught a shiny Parminder in in diamond and pearl that's not true you can't find Charmander and diamond the pro but if for whatever reason you catched it you could add it yeah yeah yeah there you go you can read it if you if you first discovered the Masuda method and diamond and pearl and you bred yourself a Charmander and then you moved him all the way up into gen seven and then all the way up with the gen 8 because that's where we're are we are right now and you're like man I wish this Charmander could be ready you could talk to that guy in rose tower and he will make your Charmander permitted into battle and you can use it in an official tournament which is a huge huge huge huge change I honestly I cannot state enough how fantastic I think that is because I just I have so many competitive VGC teams that you know people made for me and traded to me or that I bred for myself and put together that I it's like I can finally use them again and that's um super excited anymore it's just like these are my special friends that I had from the past I mean I had that with you know I bred and had a shiny hidden ability intimidate in sin Aurora from Sun and Moon and I was like ok this is cool and sin Aurora was very popular back in back in the Sun and Moon days and then in sin roar is now able to be played and sword and shield and I was like well I really want to breed another hood like it was a lot of work like I I'll just just do a regular in sin Aurora this time around because I just I already have a shiny and sinner or I don't want to spin in circles for another shiny in center Aurora well spinning in circles where it's at on snapchat but you wouldn't know that's true and now I can I can just use that in sin Aurora now which is awesome and now I can keep my shiny toric at a shining torque at I don't need to and centaurs I got the whole family I got the crew another change I have been doing some competitive battling over the weekend is that normally when you queue up for a battle you see your team and then you have to hit like the X button and then you can see their team and your team but then you have to hit the X button again to go back so you can select your for Pokemon but they just did a quality-of-life change where they just you don't need to do that anymore they just put the team right on the first page you don't have to hit X and toggle back and forth you can just see your opponent's team and just select as as you do it which is if you probably if you've never competitive battle you're like that that doesn't sound like that big of a deal but like flipping back and forth was a hassle because you only have like 90 seconds to think and so by flipping back and forth and being like I do I want this one do I want that one having it all on page is just it really it alleviates some some pressure in my opinion I can see that it's a nice little change same same same deal all all battles are double battles each player needs an attentive switcher switch light physical or digital copies players will have to have the gallery symbol showing that it caught received hashed and gallery or the battle ready symbol showing they have transferred from another game and adapted to the battle in battles in Galler all Pokemon from the gallery regional pokedex and the isle of armored pokedex are permitted except for mythical and certain legendary Pokemon Oh could all Pokemon that can currently in Giganta max are allowed cabal iam track yen Virizion are permitted all Pokemon will be little fifty duplicate Pokemon not allowed duplicate held items not allowed each battle will have a 90 second team phase view that's what it's called team phase and each battle will have seven minutes of your time 45 seconds move time 15 seconds 15 minutes game time so what that means is like a single game cannot go over 15 minutes but you just like in chess you have your own timer so if you take really really long on your turns you can technically lose based off your own timer but that rarely rarely rarely ever happens well at least for me cuz I'm bad and I'd lose well before that time or even comes close oh yeah I'm done chess is not my game all right so that's going on right now that is that is the current format if you're into that there is a lot of Rila booms and a lot of hidden ability real boom and a lot of hidden abilities in races that have seemed to pop up but maybe maybe you're done with the 20/20 maybe you're like 20/20 a bad year not interested I'm feeling 20 21 though that's not how I live my life but I'm sure you have a reason for saying that every day is precious folks well this is off pokemon.com 20 21 Championship Series information the planning for the 2021 championship series is underway

the walkways are the skyways that they do have their own little booth in the timberwolves area Mayo Clinic e building over by the baseball field but thickest is from that description I knew exactly what you were talking yeah you've already been here too long that's true we got some more news but I think it's longer than three minutes so let's take a quick break with that attitude let's take a quick break and we'll be back with some charity stuff and some Pokemon go News we'll be right back [Music] Subic child running up and down the metal arcs what did I say I'm it in with my very own eyes

there because Cindy Cole always be my favorite Pokemon I'm talking cure him oh oh you were talking about Victini yeah that's true you like Hyrum though I do like here I'm quite a bit yes I think that that dude got robbed but yeah hopefully in the remakes calling out next year gotta start calling for them remakes did not get robbed in the movie though got one of the best movies you Cal do and the swords of justice yeah best movie yeah I would not argue one of the best movies okay we are on we are hunt a very very small playing field that movie is watchable most of them art it has an actual plot most of them don't that's true rocks and keldeo stinks yeah in that movie it has everything that makes it a decent rewatchable swords out fight movie those swords were definitely out yeah I got respect for that movie cuz there's no actual bad guy in that movie right see and it's pretty good and you're all like oh there's a group my biggest issue is I don't want my Pokemon to talk in human language power is that that has been a problem of the movies forever they can talk that's not going away does kiram talk oh heck yeah he's like killed yo get out of my house dude you were not you were the voice actor for Keldeo oh heck no come on whoever the voice actor us for takia needs a raise though dude that dude was spot-on yeah it's good who was it okay go on with whatever you're gonna say now I'm gonna find out of the track oh yeah yeah kirim is arriving in five star raids in july obviously makes sense you know the ice dragon Pokemon appearing in the heat of July look they did zekrom and Reshiram it's time for caroms spotlight you're a ROM from July 1st to August 1st larvae tar the rock skin Pokemon will appear in research breakthrough and then from July 7th today I have an end date here never yes all eternity Akira I'm the boundary Pokemon will appear in five star ribs there will be a raid hour every Wednesday at six yeah okay sure there are some spot late hours taking place every Tuesday at 6:00 Tuesday July 7th it will be Taillow you will earn twice the amount of candy for transferring Pokemon so if you're doing a mass transfer of before go Fest this upcoming Tuesday is probably the day to do it Tuesday July 14th Zubat will be in spotlight our double the XP for evolving Pokemon Tuesday July 21st oddish will be in spotlight our you will earn twice the amount of stardust for catching pokémon and Tuesday July 28th weasel will be in spotlight hour and you will earn twice the amount of XP for catching pokémon don't forget go fest weekly starts July 3rd oh boy we got a lot of time man so but before we get to go fest weekly Community Day Pokemon gastly July Sunday July 19th from 11 to 5 gastly will appear more frequently in the wild if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny gastly if you evolve Haunter up to 2 hours after the event Gengar will no shadow punch take a few snapshots for surprises there will be a special one-time purchase community box including 30 ultra balls an elite fast TM 2 and cents and 2 / - super incubators we call that the scam box yep the pay2win box and then for $1 you'll be able to access a community exclusive special research story which I think the $1 are definitely worth it yeah I enjoyed the story I enjoy doing the story with Greg and then talking about how we feel robbed yep the bonus will be in cents will last for three hours eggs will be 1/4 the hatched distance which i think is a bad bonus I think if you're still doing these six hour events and you're still making incense lasts for three hours because you still want people to play at home then why are you incentivizing egg-like you know your players are going out at this point I guess but it's okay the pandemic is over I am NOT talking to you I'm not touching this with a 100 bazillion foot pole you can sit out on that flight pole and wave in the wind by yourself but we're doing community though right well oh yeah outside in a nice heart Park or maybe over at Lake yeah bidet macaque ska that's so hard to say yeah that gets real busy though other little stops are on that there I think so my pokeball plus goes off a lot while I'm riding my bike around there what talk because there is still a global pandemic go Fest will be at home and there is a lead-up to go fest here and there's all there's a lot happening I'm gonna try to give you the cliff notes here but there's a lot so week number one is the skill challenge flying Pikachu is appearing yes you can find a shining shining flying pika Chinese flying Pikachu that will go for and took a lot d'lai third - July 8th and there are more flying Pokemon in general that are spawning and Ducklin made his debut I'm very happy I like duck lit a whole lot but Tecla doesn't fly I don't think that's gonna fly yeah but duck lit does not does it not million the moon fly I think you can I think you'd sky battle with it up and Dec the P in sky battles move on they're doing this thing where they will add bonus Pokemon to that will spawn during go fest I don't know if this is fun maybe on paper it's fun but who in their right okay so if 1 million trainers complete the research Chimecho will start spawning at go fest 1 million mystic players do it a la la mola spawns and then if 1 million Valor players do is it chancy as somebody who's on Team mystic do not complete this goal no one wants a Lola mola spawning and taking up like it's just a garbage spawn that's ruining other spawns no one wants this I have news I have sky battle news breaking news ok dynamo the electric pokemon can be in sky battles well heck yeah cuz it's got levitate dude duck 'let cannot I knew it back to your regular scheduled ran Chimecho as long as they keep the Stardust Busan Chimecho I think that's fine Chansey can be shiny sure you can always use more chances but no one wants a la la mola I mean I kind of do you need one for your decks filler and then you just move on well it's it it's a bad pokemon it might be jet 5s biggest downfall I would actually hurt you now that was Pascal in yeah that looks pretty bad too Gen 5 has some bad water pokemon yeah they own it also has some great water pokemon remember mr. Gela sent and missus jealous n't and they're Pringles yeah they're alright they're more than a Moore right they're awesome if you complete the go fest weekly skilled time challenge research you will earn access to the go Fest elite skill challenge a set of difficult tasks that you can complete to earn your own personal bragging rights uh you do not need a completely real far in life you do not need to complete these tasks for your time research to count towards your go Fest you know I like to check the internet I like to check the rumblings yeah cuz you're a fool I look somebody has to stay on top of the somebody has to have their finger on the pulse of what of the Pokemon community seem like the hard core players were pretty happy with these tasks really it was catch 100 Pokemon hit 200 Pokemon total catch like 25 unique Pokemon and then make 50 excellent throws ooh that's tough for mr. Willie Anderson right there you have to do it before Wednesday July 8th so as of this as of us recording right now there's three at three days and six hours left well that's not happening then I feel so relieved yeah when I saw what the the hundred and the excellent throws thing I'm like and they get what for it bragging rights who does that letter so roomy I am NOT a child there aren't even in my early 20s there is no point where I'm gonna go to my lunch room at work and be like well well well fellows guess what I completed I have completed all the incredibly hard most difficult skill challenges in Pokemon go what are you doing and watching them all cry bitter tears this is not a thing that happens you're telling me that in your Twitter bio you don't have your Pokemon go start date how many times you've hit level 40 14:40 period because that's a sucker's game this is a real thing though you guys know this right I do know this and I actively ignore it and many of those people go unseen because I don't want to see it it is foolishness they have to like have to let you know that they started playing on day one that they're level forty times eight that they have that not only have they caught seven hundred shiny pokemon but they've released five hundred of them because they're not the most optimal pokemon that they could possibly use I think if you're gonna make something incredibly hard and tedious and understand that most of your players do not want to do that fifty excellent throws is your doing fifty excellent throws on a and you're making flying-type pokémon spawn which isn't like the best the easiest like if it was Poros wailmer and like nosepass oh I can get I can get fifty excellent throws in about 45 seconds like those Pokemon are so easy to excellent throw on but on like Pidgey and Taillow and hoot-hoot it's it's like a lot harder and I'm almost done with it Oh who's bragging now oh you knew he was in it for the bragging rights that's all this dude loops well I know I know it yeah we're gonna break too like I'm just gonna do a genetical of podcast lesions and an entire stream a stream audience who's like they hang on your missus this is what happens in this is what happens in my stream somebody will come in twitch.tv slash PKM and cast be the first time coming in and they'll be like do you shiny huh and I'll be like yeah yeah I do sure yeah okay I catch shadows every now and then I'm trying to be like be very humble about it so well what's your favorite and this is what happens what's your favorite this is the three this is the three hit combo that I get hit with every time it's jus shiny hunt what's your favorite chardy and then always always always it's how many Chinese do you have this is like the three hit combo that a new shiny hunter viewer comes into my stream so at this point I've just gotten like do you shiny hunt and I go yeah I have over 900 Chinese I just like here there's a lot we've knocked out two of the three questions right off the bat a my favorite bonus question which I've mentioned on the podcast before is how many did it take before you got the shiny now like I'm not counting clicker - like how many look it was like eighteen Venipede sir now that would have been three days sixty-five Venipede z' and mr. shiny showed up so kudos who cares I got the shiny Venipede without the long list of Herculean Labor's it doesn't count cuz you get it and then you can pop that in if you didn't suffer then why through 400 different people coming in and saying I got it in one yeah I mean did you really catch four you really get that fair most in one encounter did you though or was it all a fake I think sometimes though people people put in perspective that like the longer the hunt is the more satisfying it is and that is not how I feel about no that is what you say not true I was ready to give up on that dag on Jupiter there's no amount of this took me 17 days that's fun after the first two hours yeah I would I would probably argue shoddy fare most is probably one of my most favorite ones kiss it's like zero work I just tapped a and then it appeared in that I caught it and then I I actually think I got a bunch of ribbons on it I think it's very ribbond up actually usually I say I usually catch a shoddy Pokemon that lives in a box forever but I'm on I'm on a RHIB admission at this point anyways I mean neotec comes out and says that you're not getting anything except bragging rights so if I mean I'm glad they said that because it was really my cue to say skippin yep here's the here's the question for you guys if it gave you like a little metal like next to your go fest metal would you be no more inclined to do it No nope nope nope I don't care about achievements I don't care about medals here's the thing they are virtual constancy and when this game dies they'll go away and generally the people who want to know are curious for two seconds and then the conversation moves on to other things it's not like I can have a throng of boys around me who are like oh let me see how your medals let us bring you grapes and wine for being so awesome now that happens it's like did you get it yeah cool and then you literally move on to anything else that's more interesting to talk about than a bunch of fake medals in virtual space so you're telling me you didn't update your LinkedIn profile with the message no cuz I actually might need to get a job I do like collecting the medals on a personal level like I like seeing how many Pokemon I've caught or like which events I've gone into but you you're right no one actually cares there's probably somebody out there you're a collector you like collecting oh yeah I do but I understand that my collection pleases me just like like the list of shiny pokemon I have they please me so when somebody's oh how many encounters did it take for you to get flabébé I don't remember I'm sure it's documented somewhere cuz I have a couple viewers that like to document my stuff but I was really excited I got the shiny white flabebe that was that was really cool but I don't I don't remember how long it took I don't even know where it's living right now I think it's still in Excel I would say I'm curious of Niantic will do more stuff like this but neotec has done so many one-off things where they're like here's something okay we forgot about it that you could do but I mean I'm fine with it because there are players where Pokemon go is like their thing it's their main thing it's almost their only thing give them a challenge good enjoy not for me and I don't feel bad that I'm not going for it that well it's just like destiny there are all those skins and and things that Steve you felt you needed to collect and get because it was the special packs exclusive dois fantastic whatever it literally has zero impact of my I will not worry a half-second about it I can't wait till I hit that point in life you could hit that point in life now there's nothing there is no barrier that is stopping you from not caring not caring is the easiest thing in the world now see he's not a gen Xer no you guys have like real jobs I play pokemon for a living I got it I'm still bound by some sort of we've got his real apathy look I might read a tea style I'm on my trainer card it's in in Pokemon shield I'm up to over 3,200 Pokemon caught in that game and people will come into my stream it'll be like why are you catching them streamer why aren't you just knocking them out mer I'm mad that cuz you're not mid maxing this game as quickly as possible and I'm like look viewer who just got here number one let me show you my trainer card yeah three thousand Pokemon caught what are you sitting at you plebe 200 yeah get out of here number ting he called him a plea number two it I'm looking for some sweet marks I got I got myself a jolly Cramer and I got myself an aggressive Venipede I'm over here with a Miss drift in bouffalant that's because I'm catching him not knocking them out and they're like what remember and what happened immediately after you flexed your number somebody came in and was like I have 500 more than that that's true somebody likes lasted for like a half a second I did I did call out chat and say who had more than me and one person did have more than me so now I gotta work to beat them hey my rally score is unbeatable - anyone got a big no anyone has better rallies rather than me somebody knew that at least about the rally is that one like when you ride your bike real fast yeah yeah pass but you're a biker should be a life biker if it aint building my thighs I'm not doing it exactly that little bumper button ain't getting doing nothing from my legs I mean I really don't care I just I do like the numbers oh oh oh I do like the number going up and if I do knock them out then I can't tell if they have marks or not and I do like marked Pokemon because it's another thing to collect if I already got bouffalant well now I can collect booth lint in different way have you gotten curry 11 boo Flint by trying to camp at whatever you think about that it's another thing I can collect yeah ever done hurry stuff in aisle of armor I'm a bit bum they didn't add new curry but kind of figured wait do we talk about the real issue wasn't real issue once again back to snapchat life I have literally maxed out the number of barrel you can grow for every possible berry and ultra Sun all Tremain I have 999 of every berry you can get is my flex yep I am I am captain Barry Farber I'm so sad because it's like everyday I had some berries to plant and some berries to grow and it's like nope you're done I can't even grow more of them because once you hit 999 it doesn't matter how many more you grow they don't want them they will keep them well you can dump what 100 in those containers and send them off on a you know adventures berries yeah those are the beans bean oh that's right the B mouth get rekt Pokemon appearing more in the wild duck --let makes its get debut flying Pikachu will appear in raids and in the wild jump sword art research is back this is actually really good so that means if you haven't played in a while if you missed last year's jump research it's the same exact jump start research but it is designed to give you a bunch of Stardust in XP and some encounters I think dratini is one of them Eevee is one of them I think the jump start is where you're guaranteed is trying to Eevee at the end and then take I believe you can take five snapshots a day to get fly at five flying peaches in your house by the time this podcast is up hoo will probably be close to being over but oo return for the weekend from Friday July 3rd to July 600 is around I have seen 0 of them and I can see five gyms from my house I don't I complained about this before but the last time I complain about this I think was the clone Pokemon where I was like in packs and I saw like 400 gyms and I like never saw a Venus or spawn I only saw like Joe's aren't Blastoise this doesn't this doesn't benefit anyone except people in dis chords or Facebook groups and don't make stop making me do this mantak I don't want to join somebody's discord or Facebook to find a hoe oh just do what you're doing with Wednesday nights to say look trainers six o'clock Wednesday do it and then I don't have to coordinate with anyone I just know people will show up at 6:00 because you set the time the antic you can control this just say like hoo this weekend noon to 2:00 and then I know that I can go to a park with a bunch of gyms and I know ho-oh will spawn at noon and there will be people there just stop this randomness I hate it so much I don't want to use a discord I don't think I've ever told this on the podcast you know what the worst thing what the Milwaukee discord is ok here we go here it is though that one of the people the Milwaukee discord I'm sometimes you know I'm in a situation where I you know I see a group of people I can tell that they're nerdy enough that they're probably or they're boomer enough that they're playing Pokemon go so I pull over I'm like oh cool Giratina raid sweet I'll jump in this Giratina raid with these with these players there's always every time there's always like one person that's like very nice and they come over and they're like oh hey ba ba ba are you in the discord and I'm like yeah yeah I'm in the discord and here's the thing about the this is why when people come in they're like why did you just join a discord let me tell you about the Milwaukee discord the Milwaukee discord is is a ploy it's fake it doesn't it exists only for you to be judged because by being in the Milwaukee discord you're not in the real discord you have to join the Milwaukee discord and then there's a real discord that they will promote you to if they deem you worthy enough to participate and this sounds like Pokemon players right there so I was in the plea but discord this is the word of the day in the budget discord and I didn't say anything and everyone in that discord stays in that discord because they're not good enough to get moved into the good discord and let me tell you what I'm not doing in life I am NOT going to parade and dance around to to impress the gatekeeping better Milwaukee discord to earn the honor to get into the betterdiscord no no you can keep your Pokemon no discord I have a podcast and therefore should be moved to the upper echelons I shall not play by your rules I shall not go through your trials three may I say these three okay before like why'd you just join a discord Steve no I you don't understand how bad it is in the city but it's the same everywhere it is literally the same in DC and I swear if I had two words yes and this is the here's what's worse and I say I've heard it once I've heard it 50 times you hear the thing it's like well we had this like discord or Facebook group or something for our community and then one of the admins went bad and then like we had to ban that admin but then they started another discord and all these other people who were sympathetic to them went over to that discord so now all the groups are split and nobody likes each other and we can't show up in this and I'm like well okay when do we get the Jets and the Sharks back and we're gonna have a nice how many Gatorade bottles were thrown people take this stuff way too much trainers come out to play oh no no no no no that movie I cannot I cannot get down just like going back to it if you're gonna bring hoo back for a special read raid weekend oh just pick a time just makeup up here like from 11:02 or look it's not the antics job to make your life easier car wrecked yeah but it's your job to get my money and if they want me to spend right passes I will do it if they if they can organize this chaos but if there ain't no organizing done buying the antique vague getting no ray passes for me they'll get them from us some other sucker there's there's one born every minute week to now that we finished week one with the too long didn't read version let me tell you about week two this will start on July 10th it is the second go fest weekly challenge it will run from July 10th to July 15th you have to complete three sets of tasks in the go-fast weekly challenge battle timed research to earn an encounter with hitmonlee an encounter with abyssal and a super rocket radar if the following trainers can complete the whatever 1 million so these will spawn at go fest so 1 million instinct trainers Faraz eed 1 million mystic a lowland Grimer 1 million Valor alone marowak marowak bale these all seem fine these are all actually pretty competitive pokemon I think - and go battle league stuff that seems ok if you complete the go fest battle research you will earn access to the go Fest elite battle challenge a difficult task for bragging rights this is this is this is the lie if there's anything from this podcast you remember so what I'm about to read right now oh here we go it says have it your Pokemon ready for battle trainers on Sunday July 12th from 11 to 2 it's almost like they planned this from 11:00 to 2:00 there will be a battle themed event hopefully it won't take over too much of your time to read that again we have an event on July 12th from 11 to 2 it will be battle themed hopefully it won't take over too much of your time won't take too much of your time you're the one making the event are you saying it's so bad we hope it doesn't take you all three hours it's a ten-minute event it's you should be spending more 10 minutes in the ten minutes that's it Celebi that's what it is oh my Apple Pokemon is it you have to win three matches hopefully you win the three right off the bat otherwise enjoy the next three hours of torture what if it takes y'all three hours doing it wrong but it says right there well it's because you don't have a meta team I feel like this line was like sarcastic from like the developers or like us a bunch of suckers here hopefully it won't take too much of their time and then the copywriter forgot to delete this line what I can't assume positive intent of what this line is supposed to like make you feel besides pure hatred and anger thanks for flying Pokemon go hopefully it doesn't waste your entire day like I don't what are they trying to say here I have no answers for you friend no answers week three French and the Pokemon go Fez weekly challenge it's time to celebrate what Pokemon go is really about friend channeling wasting your time wasting your time this with your friends this challenge will ask you to make make you appreciate your pals your buddy Pokemon your fellow trainers send gifts to friends don't forget to attach stickers it might make your face get anything for attaching stickers besides the happiness of enjoy being rude to us by saying violet I he never sends me any gift so that's why I sent you a gift last night at 2:00 a.m. we'll okay sure I didn't notice any sticker on it I don't think I said just I was out of buy stickers I only had hi stickers wait we haven't talked about stickers what do you guys feel about stickers they're dumb okay I enjoyed sending them to this special you have to either have to buy them or randomly get them from gifts and the random ones are often things like why would I send this to anybody this sticker is dumb oh I've never noticed like because Chris Covanta always sends me like one of like two Pokemon hugging each other and like where did he get that one cuz I'm sure he ain't buying those stickers I mean they're really cheap I mean I'm not saying you should buy them but they're I mean you want to talk about cheap we could talk about Chris go Vontae there's a Pikachu oh right you hugging each other and it's you can get 30 stickers for 80 cents it's pretty cheap the last thinkers it's a lot of stickers that do nothing again it's virtual stickers send me really [ __ ] joy they spread joy I mixed your friend they spend joy if your friend is it sending ones that are rude like a bi ayyi but if they if they had a mechanic okay so we just spent like 40 minutes talking about min max errs and how they like use their Twitter to brag about how many how many ex peas they have but I think there is something nice about a meaningless mechanic that you don't have to care about that is still like I don't know what somebody sends me a bi sticker I think I laugh every time cuz I think it's so dumb yeah pretty much actually I number one I will say I everytime Pat from Chicago sends me a sticker it makes me smile I find is that oh yeah he could chew on I was like why I was pretty good I like angry why is it mad like okay so I saw a thread being like if you send somebody a sticker it should it should increase your lucky chance or whatever I'm already lucky friends with everybody I can be lucky friends with what don't waste my time but the second they add a mechanic to the stickers then you have to care about the stickers and sometimes it's just nice to like if you don't like the stickers then you're not missing out anything you're literally not losing anything what if they add a mechanic like Oh more lucky friends or double the then all of a sudden you have to care about it and that would be like something would be worse sometimes video games just have dumb things it's like the same reason why you buy a like a far fetch hat in the game it doesn't do anything it doesn't like increase your chance to get far-fetched but it's still like I I like this far fetch hat it makes me happy it's 2 bucks what is $2 nothing like and so I think the stickers do do you like I hope they don't actually add a mechanic to them cuz I don't want to actually worry about them but I don't think they're but I don't think they're bad sometimes games just need to have dumb fun things and I think hate me antek added something that it's like not another mechanic that I have to worry about I just it the only thing that like they just make them just put them in the game like don't charge for them is this another this is another thing they're charging for look Niantic can't make money by not charging everything I think of it in like a postcard sense like you can like every time I get like fancy postcards from Andrew or any other people they like I can't I guess I ever sent me any fancy post parents look what they gotta update your LinkedIn profile with what send me postcards but you've probably have gotten postcards where people like attach stickers to the postcard or to the envelope and then I think well that was a waste of a sticker wait why are they put in a postcard in an envelope that is like I said Posey repeats or envelopes hmm or it's that sticky that wishy washy tape I don't know what's called where people wishy-washy to yeah it's like that what he's talking about the man has gone over these literally lost my mind this up there's a the if you go to like craft stores or specifically like everywhere in Japan because they're obsessed with stationery in Japan there's like this tape and like they usually have a little well then the Pokemon centers have Pokemon tape they have like little Pikachu Jean or a little dittos and like you use the tape to like seal the envelope I don't know what's called wishy washy tape is what I call it that sounds that sounds like very Asian because like licking an envelope is too dirty yeah probably no I haven't licked an envelope since 2000 since they made self-sticking envelopes that's true I always I always will pay the extra like 40 cents to get the self sealing I just use an artificial tongue it's not either way the only postcards I ever get are from Gregg's other podcast and there's never any stickers on there so step it up it is called washi tape and I think to myself why would I buy washi tape when envelopes are already self sealing but I will say when somebody sends me an envelope with washi tape and stickers I go oh that's cute I would never spend that money but I can appreciate that so that's what I was cute that's what I would come to yeah yeah my friends my friends clearly a sucker that's how I also compare stickers in Pokemon go like I am happy to get them but I go boy they're a sucker for spending 80 cents on this now I know who to sell this bridge to I just got a random shiny Turtwig and go hey it's not bragging yeah bragging rights denier I got LinkedIn I don't think I've updated my LinkedIn in five years that's a problem you gonna put all your Pokemon a compliment accomplishments on it that's why and I get a job at the Pokemon company I guess so we're on the friendship stuff complete tasks the front time friendship to encounter all oh and right you pet the little lucky egg same stuff at go fast 1 million instinct will get togetic 1 million mystics will get your teeny 1 million valores we'll get lit WIC no one no one wants togetic unless this togetic can be shiny no one wants it people already have enough togepi's and whatnots also Tritton ax everyone's sick of dratini - i don't know I'm sick of dratini there was one time where we were all like all about getting that dry - yeah but no longer no more so is there one so okay so first weak instinct needs to have to do their stuff for Chimecho second week mmm second we mystic mystic for Grimer and then find a week we want valour for liquid everybody else can take time off for this sure I mean who knows if that's IO who knows that's happening also me Anton can just lie about these numbers it's not like there's a website we can shake you learn access to go Fest elite friendship challenge difficult set of tests for bragging rights they haven't said what that is yet Petula will make its Pokemon go debut with the oh I'm assuming that's the Friday July 17th SHINee Bellsprout will make its debut then pets alo will make its debut summer style Pikachu will be appearing in the wild and then unique snap shots so that's it that's it summer style the straw hat they haven't said I don't know maybe the self Road data mined it and they it's the same model or it's a new model I'm not gonna present sure July is a busy month for Pokemon go I do like the peach and the riichi stickers is that the ones where they're hugging yet yeah I like those too that's it there's a lot but I mean we're getting up there for Pokemon go fast so yeah but it's gonna keep building build the hype last bit of news here is the Pokemon company group donates five that million to organizations around the world following go fest 2020 they actually provided some charities here they did tweet we said we would hold them accountable because you know they have to report to us we have very powerful linkedin's we are the arbiters of Pokemon justice correct this was put out on July 2nd the Pokemon company group which includes the Pokemon company international and its parent organizations the Pokemon company recently announced the intent is to donate a milli a minimum of five million dollars USD to the following following Pokemon go fest this donation is in addition to the 5 million USD minimum that their partners a Niantic publisher and developer of Pokemon go also committed giving the organizations to give organizations following the event the Pokemon company's group donation will benefit charitable non-profitable organizations around the world to improve the lives of children which is a key pillar of the Pokemon that's pokemon brands global philanthropy facts philanthropic oh geez ibly yeah philanthropic 'el a seeking from remote the welfare of others is the definition thanks to promote the welfare promote to promote yeah ok a large portion of the organization's receiving funds from this donation were chosen due to their focus on diversity equality and inclusion as part of the Pokemon company group Pokemon companies groups ongoing commitment to black communities this includes organizations support education and mentorship for black children below is the list of organizations around the world receiving funds from the Pokemon company group it's really weird to follow the Pokemon company with the word group following Pokemon go fest more organizations will be added once confirmed all right so this is what they have so far our dodge no clue what that is latter heard of it black girls code I've had her I've heard of that yes Boys and Girls Club of Canada Maine Boys and Girls Club International was a long-standing well their guests focused on Canada this RDoc Australians children's education charity got it plan international I haven't heard of that one oh no that one no Save the Children Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trusts The Trevor Project nice plan International is an independent development and humanitarian organization which works in 71 countries across the world in Africa Americas and Asia to events children's rights and equality for girls I don't know how to say this unic efe UNICEF Onis join a child in the 70 or 80 s did you not collect coins for UNICEF now that we know ho I have me more every live a box well tell you you get up you get a little cardboard box Bank thing okay school and then you put your Valentine's Day cards in it no no this is from Halloween on Halloween you go around to get candy and then you'd hold out your UNICEF UNICEF box and make them feel guilty and then they would dig through the purse to give you pennies and dump them in there United Nations International children's education fund or you did what I did never put the box together put it in a folder and probably figure out about it yeah no I like the 70s yes yes I never heard of that the last charity on this list is World Vision which I also have never heard of sponsor a child World Vision international oh is that what that is World Vision International is an evangelical Christian humanitarian aid and development and AGA's AG advocacy group that does stuff I mean there's no doubt that children are a big part of the Pokemon companies audience they believe that children are the future but also I agree with them that most adults are a lost cause at this point so you may invest in children some of my best friends are adults thank you very much I have adult friends nobody say most of them are probably a lost cause well I'm sure after go fest I'm sure we'll get another update I'm sure by then they'll they'll donate the money and I'll probably have their final list of charities probably by the end of the month five million dollars a lot well ten million dollars if you count yeah I'm antic it's a lot of money well and that's the minimum right they could they could surprise us and be like we donated 25 Millions true I'm sure one of their accountants is running the numbers of what the minimum donation is okay there accountants out of it cuz I strings are going to say don't don't no donations no Fiscal Responsibility Countians don't know how to have fun [Laughter] some of them do they do so duco and other number based fun things okay fun is a matter of perspective much like Pokemon engagement rings Greg give us our Pokemon of the week actually not Greg's job oh sorry because of the week okay ready uh-huh it's fun to ask the question of the week it's fun to ask the question of the week you can take cup foo into a Shifu and give it its favorite meal so from The Simpsons no you're a bad bad Chris says in Pokemon sword and shield expansion past announcement it appears that the aisle of armor is to the east of Galler the crown Tundra is the south do you think they'll announce another expansion well they will let you explore other new areas to the north and to the west it's a pretty good question actually so how is that possible a crown under supposed to be cold how can it be south that's foolishness the south is cold South Pole not in gallery rally we don't know what Galler is yeah but when you go on the routes you don't get to frosty cold land until you're up at the top in the north but you're assuming that's north oh dear we'll find out maybe there's a snow problem that's happening in the south and that's why we're there exploring it's all the snowmen all the cold in the north hmm forced to leave their tundra island okay I'll say two things one I think it would be great to explore new areas because so far like the areas that they're doing I think the bigger question is do we think that they won't have a game next year that they want to that they'll want to promote like isn't if a new game isn't coming out and they really think we want to extend the shelf life of sword and shield then no like we're not gonna get them but if there's not a new game coming out or it's not coming out until November then I could see them doing a north and west I think the likelihood if any more DLC is not not likely now I don't see it happening yeah I don't know if I see more do you see happening either I feel like the content we got in may be something people were to disagree with me but I feel like the content and the isle of armor is enough to is enough that I felt like a third version right the only difference is they like spread it out in between the game so it's like you're doing the same first two gyms and then you get a little bit of something new and then you're doing the next three gyms and they're getting a little bit of something new and then all of a sudden you're doing rainbow rocket and then you're like yeah I guess that was enough that was worth $40 but it was better than the last game but only cause it had more content but to me I feel like the crown tundra is going to be like be in what do they call it Nora's the the Hoopoe rings yeah yeah I mean they were the the portals to bring in legendary yeah and then grouper rings and ultrasound alternators the wormholes so I don't know if there will be this like grand story that some people are expecting I don't think so I think it'll be another like two to three hour story and then it will be here are a bunch of ways to catch legendary Pokemon which is like exactly what the end of Omega Ruby and the end of ultra Sun altra moon was was like yep here's a bunch of legendary Pokemon and you're done and if you don't want to buy it you don't you don't get these legendary Pokemon so do you think like this year is the end of sword and shield like they just don't know what they do after it like what else couldn't they add well it's not the end because they're gonna have to have events and everything like that but I don't think they're going to be doing any kind of full-size DLC now but this is the problem - right like if they if they if Crown tundra comes out in November and then they announce a new game let's just say for talking points let's just say their Gen 4 remakes in and in January or February I mean like I don't really care what they do so if they announce a remake and they're like ok you know let's look at the patterns here we'll put Dyna maxing into Gen 4 because it's part of the same gen and then you know you can get other Pokemon you're missing from the Pokedex that comes out in November so what what do you want what do you want your trainers to do for a year like almost the year the same thing that we used to do in like 2014 and 2015 when Game Freak took a year off just enjoy the game we have I wouldn't I wouldn't hate it if they did it I agree I don't think it's very likely but III I think it's more likely if they don't have a solid solid plan for what's happening next year cuz things right now are a little wonky like a pretty big explosion of people being very excited for the DLC and pretty happy with it and then they just all kind of fell off the face of the earth I'm still loving it still playing it every day like playing the game Bobby I mean I'm still playing it every day because I'm there's still a bunch of things I need to do but most Pokemon fans they consume the content and then they move to other games and there's nothing wrong with that but they consume the content in like a weekend and then they went back to Animal Crossing cuz Animal Crossing had an update or they went to whatever other new game is coming out I don't even know what games came out recently I'm sure there's a bunch there's a remake of Tony Hawk coming out eventually at least with like a third version you're forcing your trainers to shrug like slaw through all that content again just to see the new stuff not I and I don't think that's better I think this I think the DLC part is better like I don't need to play through the game I've already played through four times to see the new content I do think it's better but it's just like a thing that Pokemon fans I feel like are not used to but I don't okay I don't know what they would be able to add in a future DLC that isn't just more Pokemon another wild area another two-hour story and mega Pokemon dens a couple users I mean just like you seed that this is why you don't work for the Pope yeah but because you're efficient it's gonna be a glare and spaceport that takes us to another Pokemon planet though in the north you can build secret bases and build your own gym yeah that perfect alright just blizzy bases all blushy faces all the time I'm okay with whatever they do if they want to take a year off that's fine they want to give more DLC with no I meant to be Call of Duty if they want to announce it like whatever they do I'm actually pretty okay with look this company likes to make money I'm sure they actually have a plan yeah they do they didn't become a ninety five billion dollar company by being like yeah I don't know what we'll do next all right we'll poke him out of the week alright so last week's Pokemon was I didn't try very hard that was part of the problem oh goodness I lost the text what was it was a limited distribution for a certain time period it's a very forgettable pokemon nobody ever wants to use it I didn't say it in the in the dealy but it was in a movie because I think that's like the only reason existed was to be in the movie what else do we have here it is the last Pokemon in the central Kailas pokedex even though it was distributed when the Hoenn region was the primary region and one month before we all started exploring all ola there you go that's the only clue you need who is that Pokemon it's how could you get wishy-washy before we started exploring Aloha dude it's your Pearl player with your pro hacker leet hacker I wrote down Genesis it's volcanion volcanium was the last X&Y Pokemon Wow yeah that's a bad Pokemon yeah I mean I wasn't paying attention and I forgot about it but I mean I mean the main clue was that we discussed it in the program when it was discovered through a datum and we're all like oh this is cool it's the first ever water fire pokemon and then by the time it finally came out we were like nope do you care about that movie was awful yeah that movie did not do that Pokemon justice silly trivia is the only fire water pokemon Wow has a decent shuffle I can't like I don't know it could be better Chinese real good though well how do you shiny hunter volcania and they're probably shiny large yeah but the one that they have on mobile videos real sweet all right so this week's Pokemon of the week is we're gonna get weird oh boy but I'm guarantee Greg will go this one no pressure within the boundaries of Minneapolis there are numerous lakes with three of the largest being Lake of the Isles today Makovsky which is really hard to say and Lake Harriet when riding my bike around the city I most frequently circle one or two of these lakes depending on my mood that day all three lakes are popular gathering places for the people of the city who frequently engage in walking running bathing sunbathing or even bike riding if I were you I would have more knowledge of each lakes ecology and geological development I would know what the human impacts on the lake wildlife are and how that could best be managed it's been real bad okay if I were me I would feel strongly about each Lakes place in Minneapolis society I would get sentimental about the sunrise over Lake Harriet I would care about the well-being of people visiting the lakes ultimately though I am US and I have the willpower to choose each day which Lake to visit which Lake I will circle on my bike as I pursue exercise and fresh air ultimately willpower is having both choice and the willingness to make a decision in Minneapolis there are no Guardians to keep us from the lakes sea that's so easy I'm sure everybody's just like right at the top of their heads right tip of their tongues mean you're not wrong okay that's our episode that's it we're done if you want to help out you can do the podcast Awards thing that we talked about that'll be in the show notes if
