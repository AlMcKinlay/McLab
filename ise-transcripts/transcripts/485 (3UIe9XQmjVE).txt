so (5:05 - 5:09)
let's get into the news (5:06 - 5:11)
first bit of news is there's a new (5:09 - 5:13)
online competition (5:11 - 5:15)
i can tell you right now it's skippable (5:13 - 5:17)
because it's single battles not double (5:15 - 5:19)
battles who would possibly want to bore (5:17 - 5:21)
themselves with single battles (5:19 - 5:23)
you can only handle so much stealth rock (5:21 - 5:24)
and (5:23 - 5:26)
toxic spikes and it's also single (5:24 - 5:29)
battles not uh (5:26 - 5:31)
what are they the tiers uh (5:29 - 5:34)
it's not smog on rules it's it's just (5:31 - 5:36)
regular vgc regular old regular there (5:34 - 5:39)
are specific rules here uh okay it's (5:36 - 5:42)
called the gym challenge during this (5:39 - 5:44)
event your battle team can only be (5:42 - 5:46)
composed of pokemon used by pokemon (5:44 - 5:49)
sword and shield gym leaders (5:46 - 5:51)
pokemon or items allowed during the (5:49 - 5:53)
competition uh it is a single battle (5:51 - 5:55)
like said you will get 50 battle points (5:53 - 5:58)
for participating that will take place (5:55 - 5:59)
um (5:58 - 6:02)
well you can sign up until november 10th (5:59 - 6:04)
and then that tournament will take place (6:02 - 6:07)
on november 11th and then go through um (6:04 - 6:10)
november 14th there is a list of pokemon (6:07 - 6:12)
and as much as i like reading a list of (6:10 - 6:14)
pokemon boy do i love it on this show to (6:12 - 6:18)
read just 20 plus pokemon in a row we (6:14 - 6:19)
ain't got time for that (6:18 - 6:22)
but wow (6:19 - 6:22)
the pokemon that the gym leaders use (6:22 - 6:27)
those are your options but the secret is (6:25 - 6:29)
you can mix and match (6:27 - 6:31)
yeah you can you can you don't have to (6:29 - 6:33)
say but if you're a true gym leader (6:31 - 6:35)
you're not going to true (6:33 - 6:36)
uh but you don't have to be like oh (6:35 - 6:38)
these are the ones that i'm i'm gonna (6:36 - 6:41)
intentionally mispronounce it in steve's (6:38 - 6:44)
honor these are the ones that rihann (6:41 - 6:45)
ryhan (6:44 - 6:46)
used (6:45 - 6:48)
i think it's raihan rihan (6:46 - 6:50)
you're ryan (6:48 - 6:54)
uh you can use his pokemon (6:50 - 6:54)
are they counting the ones that happened (6:56 - 7:00)
in the thing beforehand (6:57 - 7:03)
also counting the pokemon that happened (7:00 - 7:05)
in the champion like their yeah (7:03 - 7:07)
the end part (7:05 - 7:09)
because i also don't remember anyone (7:07 - 7:11)
using a (7:09 - 7:12)
um (7:11 - 7:14)
wait what was that pokemon i just saw on (7:12 - 7:17)
the list who's that pokemon (7:14 - 7:21)
yeah mask gallerian form yeah what i (7:17 - 7:23)
don't know oh yeah uh a little little (7:21 - 7:24)
masked kid (7:23 - 7:27)
does he use that i thought he used the (7:24 - 7:28)
evolve (7:27 - 7:29)
yeah might as well just read the list (7:28 - 7:31)
because it's going to take this long (7:29 - 7:33)
pondering i know also i don't remember (7:31 - 7:35)
anyone using a tyranitar in the first (7:33 - 7:37)
playthrough so that has to be (7:35 - 7:39)
the champion battle that does no one's (7:37 - 7:41)
using a tyranitar straight up (7:39 - 7:43)
or a shift i don't remember a shift tree (7:41 - 7:44)
either ludacola's on the list that's all (7:43 - 7:46)
that matters (7:44 - 7:48)
don't say greg (7:46 - 7:49)
and (7:48 - 7:53)
[Laughter] (7:49 - 7:54)
we already are doing shaker's spoon this (7:53 - 7:56)
weekend yeah (7:54 - 7:59)
well you can skip handcrafted for (7:56 - 8:01)
ludicolo i think (7:59 - 8:03)
i hate (8:01 - 8:06)
how alistair uses galerion mask (8:03 - 8:08)
he does yes (8:06 - 8:08)
okay (8:08 - 8:12)
i don't remember (8:08 - 8:12)
they released all right let's move on (8:12 - 8:17)
they released (8:15 - 8:18)
officially we talked about this last (8:17 - 8:22)
week but they did now put hissuian zarua (8:18 - 8:25)
and hissurian zoroark on the website (8:22 - 8:27)
they're there they're there with the (8:25 - 8:28)
official typing with the official (8:27 - 8:32)
category they have decks entries (8:28 - 8:33)
um (8:32 - 8:35)
i think they're like interesting to read (8:33 - 8:38)
here so uh the for (8:35 - 8:38)
suing (8:39 - 8:42)
it says reborn as a ghost type pokemon (8:40 - 8:45)
using the power of spite these zarua (8:42 - 8:47)
migrated to the hisui region after being (8:45 - 8:50)
driven from other lands by humans who (8:47 - 8:51)
shunned the pokemon for manifesting (8:50 - 8:55)
uncanny illusions but the zarua perished (8:51 - 8:58)
unable to survive the harsh hissuing (8:55 - 8:59)
environment and strife with other (8:58 - 9:01)
pokemon their lingering souls were (8:59 - 9:04)
reborn in the ghost type form through (9:01 - 9:06)
the power of malice towards human and (9:04 - 9:10)
pokemon that dude died (9:06 - 9:11)
no (9:10 - 9:13)
look through the power of malice towards (9:11 - 9:16)
humans that dude was a human he got his (9:13 - 9:17)
house (9:16 - 9:22)
wrecked he is dead they have no kindness (9:17 - 9:24)
in their heart they are murdering people (9:22 - 9:27)
left and right true (9:24 - 9:27)
uh it also says if hissuin zerua spot a (9:29 - 9:34)
lone person or pokemon zero may appear (9:32 - 9:36)
before them in a guise mimicking the (9:34 - 9:38)
target's appearance unlike the illusion (9:36 - 9:41)
of the previous discovered form of zerua (9:38 - 9:43)
these ghostly (9:41 - 9:46)
meme cries mimicries (9:43 - 9:47)
yes (9:46 - 9:49)
can we well i need a definition of this (9:47 - 9:51)
word (9:49 - 9:52)
it's a copy (9:51 - 9:57)
mimicry is to copy is the active topic (9:52 - 9:57)
okay (9:58 - 10:02)
like military uh they're created by (9:59 - 10:05)
using faithful power emitted from the (10:02 - 10:08)
long fur on jesus head around its neck (10:05 - 10:10)
and on its tail (10:08 - 10:13)
it appears that hasuyan zarua absorbs (10:10 - 10:15)
and draws strength from its terror of (10:13 - 10:17)
those who witness their illusions so i (10:15 - 10:19)
think the important thing here is it (10:17 - 10:21)
looks like it still probably has its (10:19 - 10:23)
ability (10:21 - 10:23)
or some variation of it yeah some (10:23 - 10:28)
version of it it's really (10:26 - 10:30)
because it says if they spot a lone (10:28 - 10:33)
person they may appear before them in a (10:30 - 10:35)
guy's mimicking the target's appearance (10:33 - 10:37)
so it doesn't sound like it's exactly (10:35 - 10:39)
like it was before (10:37 - 10:41)
what it sounds to me like is (10:39 - 10:44)
uh it does (10:41 - 10:46)
i hate to say it this way but like when (10:44 - 10:48)
you throw it out (10:46 - 10:51)
it shows up as whatever opponent is in (10:48 - 10:53)
front of it (10:51 - 10:54)
but it keeps its typing so it doesn't (10:53 - 10:56)
ditto (10:54 - 10:57)
so it stays (10:56 - 11:01)
a ghost (10:57 - 11:01)
but they're just gonna know what it is (11:02 - 11:06)
not necessarily oh that's true like i (11:04 - 11:07)
guess if you lead like if you're (11:06 - 11:09)
competitive and you're leading like with (11:07 - 11:11)
a tornado swims a cot (11:09 - 11:12)
i don't know how you would lead with (11:11 - 11:14)
those two but they both know tailwind (11:12 - 11:17)
double tailwind yeah yeah that's the (11:14 - 11:19)
best rat double tailwind they'll never (11:17 - 11:20)
see it coming (11:19 - 11:23)
it's four times as fast it's a super big (11:20 - 11:24)
tailwind (11:23 - 11:25)
it's like throwing out sonic the (11:24 - 11:26)
hedgehog yeah (11:25 - 11:32)
all speed uh for hassuing sora arc (11:26 - 11:34)
it says these spiteful powers emitted (11:32 - 11:37)
from hissuian zoroark's long uh (11:34 - 11:39)
fur projecting terrifying illusions you (11:37 - 11:40)
just skipped over writhing yeah i (11:39 - 11:42)
couldn't say that where that's writhing (11:40 - 11:45)
writhing fur project terrifying (11:42 - 11:46)
illusions (11:45 - 11:50)
it can also in inflict physical harm (11:46 - 11:52)
upon foes damaging their bodies from (11:50 - 11:54)
both inside and out and the (11:52 - 11:58)
dude is dead the illusions that painful (11:54 - 12:00)
fox pokemon projects have expressions of (11:58 - 12:03)
such utter malice towards every last (12:00 - 12:06)
thing upon the world that (12:03 - 12:08)
that those who see them are said to be (12:06 - 12:12)
driven mad by terror hmm (12:08 - 12:15)
his suing zur arc is ferociously hostile (12:12 - 12:16)
see you thought i was going to mess that (12:15 - 12:19)
one up no and aggressive towards people (12:16 - 12:21)
and other pokemon but it appears to have (12:19 - 12:23)
a compassionate streak for those that it (12:21 - 12:26)
considers close like a family it has (12:23 - 12:28)
been seen to protect (12:26 - 12:30)
zarua for example anyone able to (12:28 - 12:33)
establish trust with a hesuy and zorak (12:30 - 12:35)
would likely find it to be an invaluable (12:33 - 12:37)
ally (12:35 - 12:38)
and this pokemon and i have a lot in (12:37 - 12:39)
common (12:38 - 12:41)
do you think it's gonna be a friendship (12:39 - 12:43)
evolution (12:41 - 12:45)
um (12:43 - 12:47)
i mean that's not how regulars are (12:45 - 12:48)
evolved so (12:47 - 12:50)
[Music] (12:48 - 12:52)
does regular do friendship i don't (12:50 - 12:53)
remember no no (12:52 - 12:55)
number it's black and white so it (12:53 - 12:58)
involves that like level 132. my word (12:55 - 13:01)
uh i mean i think it could be uh (12:58 - 13:03)
a friendship illusion that would make (13:01 - 13:06)
sense (13:03 - 13:06)
that thing is five three (13:07 - 13:11)
five three (13:09 - 13:12)
160 (13:11 - 13:16)
60.9 pounds dang (13:12 - 13:16)

waiting for stamina to restore there are (14:44 - 14:47)
other methods of restoring or obtaining (14:46 - 14:50)
stamina time stamina will be (14:47 - 14:52)
added with an item when used stamina (14:50 - 14:54)
will not deplete for 30 minutes team (14:52 - 14:57)
members will also be able to sell send (14:54 - 14:58)
not sell although it wouldn't (14:57 - 15:01)
surprise me if you could sell (14:58 - 15:02)
team members would be able to send (15:01 - 15:04)
stamina to each other there are daily (15:02 - 15:07)
limits to how much can be transferred (15:04 - 15:09)
and there's a bunch of like littler (15:07 - 15:11)
stuff (15:09 - 15:13)
but so will you played the first one a (15:11 - 15:15)
bit and then you decided to start over (15:13 - 15:16)
here yes (15:15 - 15:18)
completely i started over completely (15:16 - 15:20)
fresh and i actually like (15:18 - 15:23)
the new interface i i do like the new (15:20 - 15:24)
game better i think that they really (15:23 - 15:26)
explain things better and the way that (15:24 - 15:27)
they (15:26 - 15:29)
do the introductory tutorial it makes (15:27 - 15:31)
things a lot clearer (15:29 - 15:33)
about how you're supposed to play the (15:31 - 15:35)
game and make progress and everything (15:33 - 15:37)
and it's got great music and the pokemon (15:35 - 15:39)
are all super cute and they're all (15:37 - 15:42)
really happy to hang out with you and i (15:39 - 15:44)
i love that (15:42 - 15:47)
but it's not as good as pokemon shuffle (15:44 - 15:50)
it's different from pokemon shuffle it's (15:47 - 15:53)
different it's not better or worse it's (15:50 - 15:55)
different this has more of a story than (15:53 - 15:57)
shuffle it's not like you're just going (15:55 - 15:59)
along some path and it's like all right (15:57 - 16:00)
do this oh i didn't i didn't need the (15:59 - 16:02)
story i looked forward to everything (16:00 - 16:05)
else every saturday (16:02 - 16:05)
they had good events (16:05 - 16:08)
i could i get to you know (16:08 - 16:14)
use the rowlet's super power and then it (16:11 - 16:16)
just goes like and puts a little bit of (16:14 - 16:18)
mint into the tea and it's like they add (16:16 - 16:20)
a vertical mode (16:18 - 16:21)
no (16:20 - 16:22)
that is not (16:21 - 16:25)
i haven't haven't haven't tested that (16:22 - 16:28)
uh i can test it for you right now (16:25 - 16:32)
and the answer is no (16:28 - 16:32)
if the under their big changes was you (16:33 - 16:38)
can turn it vertical oh boy it'd be so (16:35 - 16:41)
in so fast i don't know the puddles the (16:38 - 16:44)
puzzles are wide so yeah now i just (16:41 - 16:47)
don't understand (16:44 - 16:47)
the thing that really (16:47 - 16:51)
to be hung up i know the thing that i (16:49 - 16:54)
have to figure out better is like is (16:51 - 16:58)
there supposed to be some sort of like (16:54 - 17:00)
art to the way that you swirl when (16:58 - 17:02)
you're swirling or are you just trying (17:00 - 17:06)
to grab as many pokemon as you can in (17:02 - 17:08)
the time that you have i think i think (17:06 - 17:09)
there's no art to it i think it's just (17:08 - 17:11)
swirl and grab there might be some (17:09 - 17:14)
high-end cafe remix strats i only got (17:11 - 17:16)
two i think you can you know but that's (17:14 - 17:17)
when that's when you get the power-ups (17:16 - 17:18)
and you then you got to get the (17:17 - 17:21)
power-ups to the right location and like (17:18 - 17:23)
the roulette one only shoots to the (17:21 - 17:25)
right and the megaphone you never know (17:23 - 17:26)
which way that arrow's going to go but (17:25 - 17:29)
the eevee one goes like everything (17:26 - 17:30)
around it yeah (17:29 - 17:33)
that's where that's where you strategize (17:30 - 17:34)
hmm (17:33 - 17:37)
i think you could join a group (17:34 - 17:39)
when you were like level 12 or 15 or (17:37 - 17:41)
something and i was i i didn't get there (17:39 - 17:43)
i got to like level nine (17:41 - 17:47)
i played for maybe three evenings for 10 (17:43 - 17:49)
15 minutes each evening and i was (17:47 - 17:51)
you know it really didn't draw me back (17:49 - 17:51)
in (17:51 - 17:53)
if it was vertical probably would have (17:51 - 17:54)
committed (17:53 - 17:56)
uh i'll give this a chance though play (17:54 - 17:58)
it on your switch then you don't care (17:56 - 17:59)
about you don't expect anything on your (17:58 - 18:00)
switch to be vertical (17:59 - 18:03)
that's true but you're you have to use (18:00 - 18:07)
the touch screen right okay (18:03 - 18:07)
i have no idea i haven't played it on (18:07 - 18:11)
the switch but i mean (18:08 - 18:13)
can can i transfer my data to the switch (18:11 - 18:15)
is it i think you can enter you can see (18:13 - 18:18)
the account cross play yeah if it's (18:15 - 18:22)
cross play i'd be maybe more interested (18:18 - 18:22)
uh speaking of new games not really (18:23 - 18:26)
pokemon related but i do want to mention (18:24 - 18:27)

day don't forget to send pikmin out on (20:00 - 20:04)
expeditions to pick up fruit and (20:02 - 20:06)
seedlings that you passed on your way (20:04 - 20:07)
back home (20:06 - 20:08)
there are several there are seven types (20:07 - 20:11)
of pikmin total and they have their own (20:08 - 20:12)
unique characteristics that's true in (20:11 - 20:15)
the like main game too for example some (20:12 - 20:17)
can fly some are strong when friendship (20:15 - 20:19)
levels meet a certain threshold your (20:17 - 20:22)
pikmin will bring back gifts (20:19 - 20:23)
you can link your nintendo account and (20:22 - 20:27)
you can play as your me character (20:23 - 20:29)
i know will loves mes (20:27 - 20:31)
no (20:29 - 20:33)
not since the last one what was it (20:31 - 20:36)
metopia or no i didn't do the most (20:33 - 20:38)
recent one that craig was doing and all (20:36 - 20:39)
of a sudden i was some sort of villain (20:38 - 20:43)
or something weird yeah i asked you (20:39 - 20:43)
don't act like i didn't give you the one (20:43 - 20:48)
i had on my iphone that i could play (20:46 - 20:50)
every day that i really enjoyed no no (20:48 - 20:52)
more me's for me thank you (20:50 - 20:53)
i just got a don't play pikmin while (20:52 - 20:55)
driving alert (20:53 - 20:58)
um so i you're planting flowers (20:55 - 20:59)
virtually (20:58 - 21:02)
not in the real world yeah it's it's (20:59 - 21:05)
um (21:02 - 21:05)
so i played harry potter wizards unite i (21:05 - 21:11)
think we all did right yeah nope and i (21:08 - 21:13)
i think greg and i had very similar (21:11 - 21:15)
complaints with harry potter which was (21:13 - 21:19)
it's really hard to play and walk yep (21:15 - 21:21)
uh like the game wanted so much of you (21:19 - 21:24)
and it was cool to do the spells but (21:21 - 21:26)
like when you're out in the sun doing a (21:24 - 21:28)
spell you're just like i just wanted to (21:26 - 21:30)
get this over with where pokemon go is (21:28 - 21:31)
very (21:30 - 21:35)
it's i i find it easy to walk and catch (21:31 - 21:36)
yeah i find it even easier than you i (21:35 - 21:38)
just put my pokeball plus on and keep (21:36 - 21:40)
squeezing (21:38 - 21:41)
um (21:40 - 21:43)
so the (21:41 - 21:47)
the pikmin map is is is very simple it's (21:43 - 21:49)
kind of hard to show i mean it's free to (21:47 - 21:51)
play the game you can download it uh it (21:49 - 21:53)
looks (21:51 - 21:54)
the the thing i liked about harry potter (21:53 - 21:56)
though is the map looked cooler than (21:54 - 21:58)
pokemon right off the bat although i (21:56 - 22:00)
think pokemon is kind of slightly caught (21:58 - 22:01)
up with it but (22:00 - 22:02)
um (22:01 - 22:04)
the other cool thing about harry potter (22:02 - 22:05)
is you could like download all the (22:04 - 22:08)
assets and it was like six gigs (22:05 - 22:10)
and it would make the app load faster (22:08 - 22:12)
i'm not sure why pokemon go doesn't have (22:10 - 22:15)
this but pikmin (22:12 - 22:16)
bloom (22:15 - 22:18)
uh (22:16 - 22:19)
it has the whole like (22:18 - 22:22)
i mean all their games are (22:19 - 22:22)
ar games so they're using the map data (22:23 - 22:28)
that's the important thing so like the (22:26 - 22:31)
whole harry potter pikmin pokemon you're (22:28 - 22:34)
a character with things around you and (22:31 - 22:35)
you pinch and zoom (22:34 - 22:37)
and you rotate the map (22:35 - 22:40)
and it's that that that is the same (22:37 - 22:42)
uh (22:40 - 22:44)
there is money (22:42 - 22:48)
and it is laid out very similar to (22:44 - 22:52)
pokemon go in the in the store aspect um (22:48 - 22:54)
but it really (22:52 - 22:55)
i don't know i maybe because i'm not far (22:54 - 22:57)
enough in the game i'm level four (22:55 - 22:59)
but the (22:57 - 23:00)
it doesn't i don't know what i'm working (22:59 - 23:02)
towards (23:00 - 23:02)
uh (23:03 - 23:05)
it has the same flowers (23:04 - 23:07)
what was that beautiful world full of (23:05 - 23:09)
flowers yeah maybe you're working (23:07 - 23:11)
towards so it has the same coin system (23:09 - 23:13)
as pokemon go 100 coins 99 cents (23:11 - 23:16)
550 coins for 4.99 (23:13 - 23:19)
14 000 coins for 99 (23:16 - 23:21)
and you can use your coins to buy (23:19 - 23:23)
they have the same three bundles they (23:21 - 23:25)
have a flower pack a special flower pack (23:23 - 23:27)
a bloom pack i don't know what these (23:25 - 23:29)
items do yet you can buy flower petals (23:27 - 23:31)
with them (23:29 - 23:32)
um (23:31 - 23:35)
they have like uh so the pikmin are kind (23:32 - 23:37)
of like incubators (23:35 - 23:40)
so you get two free incubators for free (23:37 - 23:42)
and then when you get a seed which is (23:40 - 23:44)
your pikmin you plant it and then when (23:42 - 23:46)
you walk like a thousand steps (23:44 - 23:49)
then it hatches and then you have a new (23:46 - 23:51)
picture so the pikmin are like eggs not (23:49 - 23:53)
like incubators (23:51 - 23:54)
yes the pikmin are like eggs but they're (23:53 - 23:57)
seeds (23:54 - 23:57)
if you link your nintendo account you (23:59 - 24:02)
get a big (24:00 - 24:05)
seed and it's ten thousand steps (24:02 - 24:07)
and i'm only at six thousand steps so i (24:05 - 24:08)
don't know what the hatch is into i (24:07 - 24:09)
guess i could look it up on the internet (24:08 - 24:11)
spaceship (24:09 - 24:13)
and then there are single use planting (24:11 - 24:14)
thingies (24:13 - 24:17)
so like i said you get two for free (24:14 - 24:19)
you can buy a single use one for a (24:17 - 24:21)
dollar fifty which seems like a lot (24:19 - 24:24)
because a thousand steps is pretty (24:21 - 24:26)
easy to do (24:24 - 24:27)
even ten thousand steps i'm almost done (24:26 - 24:29)
with it in a day (24:27 - 24:31)
maybe because i'm moving so i'm walking (24:29 - 24:34)
off that's yeah like (24:31 - 24:36)
a lot of the pandemic had me moving (24:34 - 24:40)
at most 400 steps (24:36 - 24:40)
but i would say first impressions so (24:40 - 24:45)
first impressions of harry potter way (24:43 - 24:47)
more complex than pokemon and (24:45 - 24:49)
i felt like i couldn't jungle juggle (24:47 - 24:51)
both because harry potter was asking way (24:49 - 24:53)
too much of me and i feel like pokemon (24:51 - 24:56)
go already asks way too much of you (24:53 - 24:57)
pikmin (24:56 - 25:00)
seems to not ask that much of you and (24:57 - 25:02)
it's really just like every time i open (25:00 - 25:04)
it it's just like here are your steps (25:02 - 25:07)
and i'm like i'm kind of into that (25:04 - 25:08)
i'm kind of into it just being like you (25:07 - 25:11)
you walked great job on walking (25:08 - 25:13)
uh and i don't have any like stops near (25:11 - 25:15)
my house i don't like every the gym (25:13 - 25:16)
that's across the street there's nothing (25:15 - 25:18)
there the gym down the street nothing (25:16 - 25:20)
there i mean there is something there (25:18 - 25:22)
there's a little plant i don't know what (25:20 - 25:24)
that does i haven't interacted with it (25:22 - 25:26)
get your flame thrower and burn it down (25:24 - 25:28)
burn it down so i only see one plant (25:26 - 25:31)
i'll try to walk towards it what but i'm (25:28 - 25:34)
invested i want to see where this goes (25:31 - 25:36)
did you play regular pikmin yeah i (25:34 - 25:38)
played all three see i've never played a (25:36 - 25:40)
pikmin so i do not i the closest i've (25:38 - 25:42)
ever come to pikmin is remember how the (25:40 - 25:46)
3ds had the puzzles the 3d puzzles yeah (25:42 - 25:47)
i mean i completed every single one of (25:46 - 25:49)
those puzzles and one of them or two of (25:47 - 25:52)
them were pikmin puzzles there you go (25:49 - 25:55)
i like pikmin i think it's a cool series (25:52 - 25:59)
well sometimes you're not right (25:55 - 26:02)
[Laughter] (25:59 - 26:03)
uh (26:02 - 26:05)
yeah so far so far it's really cute and (26:03 - 26:07)
i think the barrier to entry is really (26:05 - 26:10)
low the thing that i do like is the um (26:07 - 26:11)
when the pikmin like hatched or i don't (26:10 - 26:15)
know grew or born came out of the ground (26:11 - 26:17)
it like it knew the neighborhood i was (26:15 - 26:18)
in (26:17 - 26:19)
so (26:18 - 26:20)
like obviously i lived in milwaukee (26:19 - 26:22)
wisconsin but they're our neighborhood (26:20 - 26:23)
like (26:22 - 26:25)
it's it said the neighborhood and then (26:23 - 26:27)
it said milwaukee wisconsin and i was (26:25 - 26:28)
like oh that's really cool the (26:27 - 26:29)
neighborhood where it hatched or the (26:28 - 26:32)
neighborhood where you got the seed from (26:29 - 26:34)
the neighborhood where it hatched uh (26:32 - 26:36)
yeah but (26:34 - 26:38)
like all the pokemon ghost stuff does (26:36 - 26:40)
that too (26:38 - 26:42)
um i don't know if pokemon go (26:40 - 26:43)
specifically says my neighborhood i (26:42 - 26:46)
think it just says milwaukee (26:43 - 26:46)
i guess it depends on where you are (26:48 - 26:53)
because i'm pretty sure minneapolis is (26:51 - 26:55)
very well divided in pokemon go terms (26:53 - 26:58)
let me see let me see if it says uh (26:55 - 27:01)
so this litwick says hatch in milwaukee (26:58 - 27:02)
wisconsin (27:01 - 27:05)
hatch in milwaukee wisconsin (27:02 - 27:08)
um so the pumpkaboo is it says caught in (27:05 - 27:11)
wauwatosa wisconsin which that (27:08 - 27:13)
that's another that's just another city (27:11 - 27:14)
i'm talking about like neighborhood (27:13 - 27:15)
neighborhoods (27:14 - 27:17)
maybe they've refined things with the (27:15 - 27:19)
pikmins i don't know you can actually (27:17 - 27:20)
give out your address now because you (27:19 - 27:22)
won't be there by the time this comes (27:20 - 27:23)
out that's true (27:22 - 27:26)
specifically (27:23 - 27:29)
specifically it says cops park milwaukee (27:26 - 27:30)
wisconsin because my neighborhood is (27:29 - 27:33)
cops park (27:30 - 27:33)
so i i don't know it's cool i i really (27:34 - 27:38)
like it i think i think it's a really (27:36 - 27:40)
it's it's so far it is very little of me (27:38 - 27:42)
and the 10 minutes i've given it i was (27:40 - 27:44)
like this is rad (27:42 - 27:47)
it asks very little of you now give it (27:44 - 27:49)
two months (27:47 - 27:51)
i am sure there are pokemon go players (27:49 - 27:53)
being very mad this game exists when i'm (27:51 - 27:56)
sure that there's a whole (27:53 - 27:59)
team there they make the improvements (27:56 - 28:02)
that i need them to make that see this (27:59 - 28:05)
is the reason why we had the gallerian (28:02 - 28:08)
slow king disaster (28:05 - 28:10)
because they were spending their time (28:08 - 28:12)
making pikmins and not paying attention (28:10 - 28:13)
to the really important stuff that's (28:12 - 28:16)
right that's right they were like hey (28:13 - 28:18)
all you pokemon people start working on (28:16 - 28:20)
this game no i actually have different (28:18 - 28:23)
teams i have a walking game already it's (28:20 - 28:26)
called pokemon go (28:23 - 28:26)
yeah i think that's like the that's like (28:26 - 28:30)
the weird thing right because pikmin's (28:28 - 28:32)
not a huge (28:30 - 28:33)
franchise (28:32 - 28:34)
i would probably say splatoon is (28:33 - 28:35)
probably bigger (28:34 - 28:39)
that's pretty popular though zelda (28:35 - 28:39)
arms no i'm sure people yeah arms let's (28:39 - 28:44)
get the arms walking game well that was (28:42 - 28:46)
that was the thing with harry potter too (28:44 - 28:48)
it's like okay so you know people (28:46 - 28:51)
like pokemon go (28:48 - 28:53)
and (28:51 - 28:55)
but the some of the complaints of (28:53 - 28:59)
pokemon go was i wish it did more (28:55 - 29:00)
and then harry potter came out niantic (28:59 - 29:02)
did say like oh harry potter is going to (29:00 - 29:03)
be more hardcore (29:02 - 29:05)
and people really like harry potter like (29:03 - 29:08)
that franchise is very good um (29:05 - 29:10)
but (29:08 - 29:12)
i i don't know i don't know if the the i (29:10 - 29:13)
don't know if it was (29:12 - 29:16)
jk rowling's fault probably i don't know (29:13 - 29:18)
if it was just harry potter in general (29:16 - 29:20)
fallen off don't know probably because (29:18 - 29:22)
pokemon is still thriving i mean because (29:20 - 29:23)
they're putting out new games there's no (29:22 - 29:27)
new harry potter books (29:23 - 29:29)
harry potter a lot of things like the (29:27 - 29:31)
franchise is alive and healthy yeah (29:29 - 29:33)
they're doing a movie still (29:31 - 29:36)
um but but i also don't know if it's (29:33 - 29:37)
because it was too complex right so (29:36 - 29:39)
there's like three variables that could (29:37 - 29:41)
affect it i do hate the argument that is (29:39 - 29:43)
like oh the only reason pokemon go (29:41 - 29:46)
succeeds is because it's pokemon uh i (29:43 - 29:48)
find that like i hate that argument look (29:46 - 29:49)
at pokemon rumble rush look at pokemon (29:48 - 29:51)
duel like there are so many pokemon (29:49 - 29:52)
things that have just straight up (29:51 - 29:55)
flopped actually the the the very clear (29:52 - 29:58)
counter argument to that are the number (29:55 - 30:00)
of people who never played any other (29:58 - 30:03)
pokemon game in their life who started (30:00 - 30:05)
playing pokemon go and love playing (30:03 - 30:07)
pokemon go (30:05 - 30:09)
it's the pokemon that brought them in (30:07 - 30:12)
it's the gameplay yeah (30:09 - 30:14)
and even even if we look at a game like (30:12 - 30:15)
unite which has been out for three (30:14 - 30:17)
months like it's fallen off pretty hard (30:15 - 30:19)
at least with (30:17 - 30:21)
our communities directly and what i've (30:19 - 30:23)
seen on twitch now obviously those are (30:21 - 30:26)
two smaller parts but (30:23 - 30:28)
like they just did a halloween event and (30:26 - 30:30)
it feels like no one cares whereas (30:28 - 30:32)
pokemon go has been really good at (30:30 - 30:34)
getting people to come back (30:32 - 30:36)
uh with their events even if their (30:34 - 30:38)
events are repeat like darkrai or people (30:36 - 30:40)
came back people like pumpkaboo and (30:38 - 30:42)
stuff what are you laughing at if there (30:40 - 30:45)
wasn't a more confirmation biases (30:42 - 30:47)
statement it seems to me that nobody (30:45 - 30:49)
cares i'm not saying no one cares i'm (30:47 - 30:50)
just saying within our communities and (30:49 - 30:52)
with the communities i see on twitch it (30:50 - 30:55)
has fallen off i'm sure that unite is (30:52 - 30:57)
still very popular in asia which that's (30:55 - 30:59)
where it was popular in a lot of places (30:57 - 31:02)
like yeah those aren't great metrics to (30:59 - 31:03)
judge a game's popularity those are fine (31:02 - 31:05)
metrics because if i'm saying our (31:03 - 31:07)
community is still super into park (31:05 - 31:08)
pokemon go and our community is not so (31:07 - 31:10)
into pokemon unite i think that is fine (31:08 - 31:12)
in the example what are you defining as (31:10 - 31:14)
our community (31:12 - 31:16)
like just the people you interact with (31:14 - 31:17)
the thousands of people that listen to (31:16 - 31:19)
this program (31:17 - 31:22)
again they are a tiny portion of the (31:19 - 31:25)
much larger world but i am saying i (31:22 - 31:27)
might i am not saying in the whole world (31:25 - 31:28)
it has fallen off i am saying in our (31:27 - 31:31)
community no yeah he's being anecdotal (31:28 - 31:34)
he acknowledges that it's an anecdotal (31:31 - 31:36)
not a universal if we look at our slack (31:34 - 31:38)
channel pokemon go is still probably the (31:36 - 31:40)
most active (31:38 - 31:41)
slack channel (31:40 - 31:42)
that we have (31:41 - 31:44)
unite (31:42 - 31:47)
not so much (31:44 - 31:47)
speaking of pokemon go there is a (31:49 - 31:56)
dia de mertros event how was that was (31:53 - 32:00)

designed specifically for me (37:57 - 38:01)
uh okay that's it for pokemon go (38:03 - 38:08)
what (38:06 - 38:09)
uh okay (38:08 - 38:11)
okay that's your pokemon go minute i (38:09 - 38:13)

question will did you get all the sizes (38:23 - 38:28)
i've got no poke pumpkin (38:25 - 38:30)
zero it's still a shadow on my little (38:28 - 38:33)
radar dealy (38:30 - 38:36)
why would they catch pokemon (38:33 - 38:37)
that's that's true (38:36 - 38:40)
catching maybe pikmin bloom is for you (38:37 - 38:42)
yeah you can just walk and leave flowers (38:40 - 38:44)
behind you the thing i like less than (38:42 - 38:47)
catching is pikmin (38:44 - 38:47)
you don't like flowers (38:48 - 38:51)
i certainly (38:50 - 38:54)
have made it very clear on this program (38:51 - 38:59)
and other programs i detest all plants (38:54 - 39:01)
i do not like (38:59 - 39:03)
garden escapes (39:01 - 39:05)
there's very little gardening in garden (39:03 - 39:06)
escapes (39:05 - 39:10)
it's mostly fruit (39:06 - 39:10)
honestly (39:15 - 39:20)
honestly the majority of gardenscapes is (39:17 - 39:22)
paving over (39:20 - 39:24)
the grass (39:22 - 39:25)
with pavement (39:24 - 39:27)

they're just throwing people into (41:22 - 41:27)
masters with the wild pokemon just like (41:24 - 41:29)
these two shove them together (41:27 - 41:31)
they okay so here's the thing you're (41:29 - 41:34)
right there are way too many characters (41:31 - 41:36)
but that's literally what they asked for (41:34 - 41:38)
they asked people what they wanted and (41:36 - 41:40)
people voted on more characters like (41:38 - 41:43)
costumes and alternative outfits and (41:40 - 41:45)
just having more sink pairs was like (41:43 - 41:50)
constantly always voted up yeah and boy (41:45 - 41:52)
boy did they do it (41:50 - 41:54)
i mean that's they listened to what (41:52 - 41:57)
people wanted and now it's like (41:54 - 42:00)
i don't know if people are sour on it (41:57 - 42:02)
i don't think i am this is how i think (42:00 - 42:05)
about it and it took me (42:02 - 42:05)
it took me a couple months into masters (42:05 - 42:08)
to just (42:07 - 42:09)
accept (42:08 - 42:11)
that i'm not going to get everything oh (42:09 - 42:14)
yeah i got to that a long time ago and (42:11 - 42:16)
things will come back (42:14 - 42:17)
and that's fine (42:16 - 42:19)
um (42:17 - 42:19)
but i saw you know some people being (42:20 - 42:23)
like there's just too many costumes how (42:22 - 42:24)
are some how is somebody going to (42:23 - 42:26)
collect all these and it's like have you (42:24 - 42:28)
have you never purchased the trading (42:26 - 42:30)
card game have you tried have you tried (42:28 - 42:33)
to complete a set of the tcg i mean (42:30 - 42:34)
fusion strike is coming out and i think (42:33 - 42:37)
it's 250 cards good luck (42:34 - 42:40)
like unless you're buying singles (42:37 - 42:42)
you're never going to complete that (42:40 - 42:43)
without (42:42 - 42:45)
no you just spell case (42:43 - 42:47)
yeah well a case is what 10 booster (42:45 - 42:49)
packs that's 360 (42:47 - 42:53)
yeah 360 packs cases 10 booster boxes (42:49 - 42:54)
booster boxes (42:53 - 42:57)
each booster box has 36 packs so yeah (42:54 - 42:59)
360 packs that's still not probably (42:57 - 43:01)
going to get you every card (42:59 - 43:03)
if you can't get every card in a case (43:01 - 43:05)
you're playing the wrong trading card (43:03 - 43:05)
game (43:05 - 43:07)
you are it's called the pokemon trading (43:05 - 43:09)
card you should be able to get at least (43:07 - 43:11)
one of every card in a case i don't know (43:09 - 43:14)
about that folks hey guess what (43:11 - 43:15)
in vanguard (43:14 - 43:17)
they have like guaranteed distributions (43:15 - 43:19)
so (43:17 - 43:23)
come on over kids play a real tcg (43:19 - 43:23)
i don't know i just think of it as like (43:23 - 43:26)
the pokemon trading card game at this (43:24 - 43:28)
point (43:26 - 43:31)
you you if you can't you can't possibly (43:28 - 43:33)
get every character even if you spend (43:31 - 43:35)
money well i guess it well depends on (43:33 - 43:37)
how much of a whale you are but (43:35 - 43:39)
um (43:37 - 43:40)
so you just have to start picking which (43:39 - 43:41)

there are new trainer bundles that (46:59 - 47:01)
they're adding (47:00 - 47:03)
they've changed some background music (47:01 - 47:05)
for some sync pair scouts (47:03 - 47:06)
screens (47:05 - 47:09)
they've changed the battle speed (47:06 - 47:12)
for co-op (47:09 - 47:12)
which (47:13 - 47:16)
what co-op events are anyone even doing (47:14 - 47:17)
at this point (47:16 - 47:20)
none like the co-op thing is just a big (47:17 - 47:22)
waste (47:20 - 47:22)
they added some more story stuff (47:23 - 47:30)
the next villain arc is appearing (47:27 - 47:32)
um every 25th of every month is going to (47:30 - 47:34)
be pokemon masters day so starting next (47:32 - 47:35)
month (47:34 - 47:37)
the 25th of every month is design is (47:35 - 47:39)
designated to be pokemon masters day in (47:37 - 47:41)
honor of pikachu's pokedex number please (47:39 - 47:44)
note that that time is based on the 25th (47:41 - 47:47)
at 3 p.m in japan jst (47:44 - 47:50)
uh on each pokemon masters day we will (47:47 - 47:52)
have rallies of other things (47:50 - 47:53)
things prepared as a sign of (47:52 - 47:55)
appreciation for your support we hope (47:53 - 47:57)
you log into the game on the 25th of (47:55 - 47:58)
every month and enjoy playing masters (47:57 - 48:00)
even more i'm very curious what that is (47:58 - 48:02)
going to look like yeah (48:00 - 48:05)
um well also the thing so they had the (48:02 - 48:06)
daily rotation (48:05 - 48:08)
battles which gave you (48:06 - 48:10)
uh bp coins (48:08 - 48:13)
but because this game is solely about (48:10 - 48:15)
collecting now (48:13 - 48:16)
you get (48:15 - 48:18)
summoning tickets (48:16 - 48:21)
for the specific region (48:18 - 48:23)
that that you're fighting in (48:21 - 48:26)
so when it was all kanto you got kanto (48:23 - 48:28)
tickets and when it was hoenn you got (48:26 - 48:30)
hoen tickets and when you get 30 hoenn (48:28 - 48:31)
tickets (48:30 - 48:34)
you get to get an automatic hoenn five (48:31 - 48:35)
star (48:34 - 48:36)
yeah (48:35 - 48:39)
so the fact that they have just decided (48:36 - 48:40)
like (48:39 - 48:43)
okay the bp is definitely not enough you (48:40 - 48:45)
are now getting summoning tickets (48:43 - 48:47)
because we have so many pairs so they're (48:45 - 48:49)
like trying to like mitigate it a little (48:47 - 48:51)
bit (48:49 - 48:52)
well again it's like the pokemon trading (48:51 - 48:54)
card game how many people (48:52 - 48:56)
just keep buying cards and then put them (48:54 - 48:57)
in a binder versus how many people are (48:56 - 48:59)
actually like (48:57 - 49:00)
playing the game i mean a lot of people (48:59 - 49:02)
play the trading card game for sure like (49:00 - 49:03)
yeah (49:02 - 49:05)
but i would wager to bet there are more (49:03 - 49:08)
people that just straight up collect (49:05 - 49:10)
um and at least for me masters has (49:08 - 49:12)
always been collecting i mean i i (49:10 - 49:13)
obviously do the events i play them but (49:12 - 49:15)
i'm not (49:13 - 49:17)
hardcore doing the (49:15 - 49:19)
elite four thing that they feature every (49:17 - 49:21)
i don't even know when it rotates i have (49:19 - 49:23)
only done it like twice it was fine like (49:21 - 49:25)
but it and it's not on my to-do list of (49:23 - 49:27)
like oh i must do this (49:25 - 49:29)
um (49:27 - 49:29)
the next update for masters will be late (49:30 - 49:34)
november (49:32 - 49:35)
and they will they said there will be (49:34 - 49:36)
new sink pairs in december probably (49:35 - 49:39)
bringing back some holiday stuff and i'm (49:36 - 49:41)
sure they're adding new holiday stuff (49:39 - 49:42)
right there's (49:41 - 49:44)
this will be the third christmas i think (49:42 - 49:47)
yep yeah (49:44 - 49:47)
it seems fine look they're like the the (49:47 - 49:52)
thing i could say about masters (49:49 - 49:55)
is they didn't do what duel did which (49:52 - 49:56)
just like (49:55 - 49:59)
changed way too late (49:56 - 50:00)
and then just folded (49:59 - 50:02)
like i at least i feel like masters is (50:00 - 50:04)
constantly changing constantly trying to (50:02 - 50:06)
get new people in they (50:04 - 50:07)
they asked what people wanted people (50:06 - 50:08)
said they want more synth pairs and (50:07 - 50:09)
they're like (50:08 - 50:11)
you want more (50:09 - 50:11)
pairs you (50:11 - 50:12)
we sing (50:11 - 50:12)
nothing but zinc pears this game is (50:13 - 50:19)
lousy with sync pairs (50:16 - 50:19)
so i don't i don't know maybe i'll do (50:19 - 50:23)
another survey of like what people want (50:21 - 50:25)
but i'm still mad that they didn't take (50:23 - 50:28)
my feedback of putting mirror b in the (50:25 - 50:30)
that's true yet (50:28 - 50:32)
he's not there yet (50:30 - 50:34)
they've added like fifty thousand new (50:32 - 50:35)
sig pairs in that one and they're gonna (50:34 - 50:38)
have a special event for mirror b oh (50:35 - 50:40)
they look if they can add caitlyn's (50:38 - 50:43)
butler with star raptor that i'm sure (50:40 - 50:46)
they could possibly add unicode (50:43 - 50:48)
made me laugh so hard i'm like you're (50:46 - 50:50)
adding the butler (50:48 - 50:53)
before mirror b does the character (50:50 - 50:55)
actually have (50:53 - 50:55)
i don't know his name i was like who is (50:57 - 51:03)
this where is caitlin getting all of her (51:00 - 51:06)
money from i mean she's a psychic (51:03 - 51:09)
dude oh she predicted the stock market (51:06 - 51:10)
in the uh (51:09 - 51:12)
ah (51:10 - 51:15)
just because cynthia visits caitlyn's (51:12 - 51:19)
summer home in unova does not mean (51:15 - 51:21)
anything (51:19 - 51:23)
i (51:21 - 51:23)
it's weird i don't know how to say his (51:34 - 51:38)
name how do they add caitlyn's butler (51:36 - 51:40)
and hugh is not in the game this is (51:38 - 51:42)
mind-blowing to me (51:40 - 51:44)
nobody likes you (51:42 - 51:46)
i like you (51:44 - 51:48)

at gamestop oh yeah yeah so you can get (55:34 - 55:39)
well i'll just say this again (55:37 - 55:40)
you can go into gamestop you can get (55:39 - 55:43)
your zashian code in the united states (55:40 - 55:46)

streams let's say you only bought one (55:52 - 55:57)
copy of the game you only bought pokemon (55:55 - 55:59)
shield which zashian works for what i (55:57 - 56:01)
would recommend is get two codes from (55:59 - 56:03)
gamestop just be like hey can i get two (56:01 - 56:04)
codes nine times out of ten they will (56:03 - 56:07)
give you two codes if that you do not (56:04 - 56:08)
have to buy anything you do not have to (56:07 - 56:10)
pre-order anything if they're out of (56:08 - 56:11)
codes they can print them on a receipt (56:10 - 56:13)
we've gone through this many times (56:11 - 56:15)
gamestop is the worst it's fine get two (56:13 - 56:18)
codes oh so this is what you do you're (56:15 - 56:20)
redeeming the zashian for yourself you (56:18 - 56:23)
make a test account or a ba or a (56:20 - 56:25)
secondary account on your switch play (56:23 - 56:26)
through the first five minutes of the (56:25 - 56:29)
game go to mystery gift redeem the (56:26 - 56:30)
second zashian (56:29 - 56:32)
now somebody else in our discord or our (56:30 - 56:34)
slack has the same problem as you and (56:32 - 56:36)
they have the opposite game you down you (56:34 - 56:39)
get two zashians with your one copy (56:36 - 56:41)
one for you then you trade your zashi (56:39 - 56:43)
into another person that has the other (56:41 - 56:45)
copy they do the same thing they'll get (56:43 - 56:47)
two zamasuntas figure it out coordinated (56:45 - 56:49)
in the discord coordinated in the slack (56:47 - 56:50)
you can do it don't you don't have to (56:49 - 56:52)
buy two games another pro strategy (56:50 - 56:54)
somebody said go to the library and rent (56:52 - 56:57)
the other game oh this could work yeah (56:54 - 56:59)

what grits it tastes like i need the (61:47 - 61:53)
authentic grits experience yeah (61:49 - 61:53)
authentic grits give flavor to other (61:54 - 61:59)
things that are not grits hissuian form (61:56 - 62:00)
is (61:59 - 62:03)
think indiana jones but slightly more (62:00 - 62:04)
handsome (62:03 - 62:08)
hmm i'm into that (62:04 - 62:08)
with or without whip (62:10 - 62:14)
uh (62:13 - 62:16)
well i don't do guns so i'll start with (62:14 - 62:18)
the whip yeah i'll whip i'll whip all (62:16 - 62:19)
the (62:18 - 62:22)
time uh (62:19 - 62:22)
this is from tom off our youtube if you (62:24 - 62:29)
also want us to do question of the week (62:27 - 62:31)
you can leave a youtube comment (62:29 - 62:32)
um (62:31 - 62:35)
also hit the like subscribe button do (62:32 - 62:37)
you think they're uh do you think we'll (62:35 - 62:39)
see any ancient fossilized pokemon and (62:37 - 62:40)
legends of arceus and what types would (62:39 - 62:42)
they be assuming of course that (62:40 - 62:44)
fossilized pokemon would gain the rock (62:42 - 62:46)
type uh as an effect of the (62:44 - 62:49)
defossilation process would be great to (62:46 - 62:51)
see how some of these pokemon originally (62:49 - 62:54)
looked uh i would counter argue that (62:51 - 62:55)
they gained the rock type as part of the (62:54 - 62:58)
fossilization process (62:55 - 63:00)
not the de-fossilization process but (62:58 - 63:03)
that's splitting hair earlier oh my word (63:00 - 63:05)
do you know that de-thawing means (63:03 - 63:08)
freezing something but (63:05 - 63:10)
anyways (63:08 - 63:12)
number one i don't think (63:10 - 63:15)
that legends arceus is that far in the (63:12 - 63:18)
past that we'd be walking yeah you got a (63:15 - 63:19)
cell phone look we don't know what what (63:18 - 63:22)
year it is (63:19 - 63:22)
crown tundra has made the concept of (63:23 - 63:28)
fossil pokemon also (63:25 - 63:31)
askew um i don't know why people say (63:28 - 63:32)
that (63:31 - 63:34)
because you've got (63:32 - 63:35)
the aurora (63:34 - 63:38)
auroras walking around yeah it's not (63:35 - 63:39)
like people haven't been breeding and (63:38 - 63:41)
releasing in those games forever they (63:39 - 63:43)
just migrated over got a point you got a (63:41 - 63:45)
point people have been making those eggs (63:43 - 63:48)
and put them into the world for hundreds (63:45 - 63:51)
of years at this point (63:48 - 63:51)
uh so what is it in (63:51 - 63:56)
cinocino was (63:54 - 63:57)
oh is it with the awful ones like (63:56 - 63:59)
bastard (63:57 - 64:02)
yeah it was shielding us and yeah (63:59 - 64:03)
bass (64:02 - 64:05)
bastion or whatever it is (64:03 - 64:08)
shield on bastion (64:05 - 64:10)
i mean so cranny dose is just pure rock (64:08 - 64:12)
isn't it (64:10 - 64:14)
so wouldn't it just stay rock (64:12 - 64:17)
i think they're saying like (64:14 - 64:19)
like a fossilized versus a version of (64:17 - 64:21)
like sand true (64:19 - 64:22)
like sandshrew is a fossil well i'm (64:21 - 64:26)
using sandshrew as an example (64:22 - 64:26)
what i thought was more like (64:31 - 64:36)
look at this (64:35 - 64:37)
since (64:36 - 64:39)
the fossils gain (64:37 - 64:42)
the rock type like oh they're asking the (64:39 - 64:45)
opposite like what what would omanite (64:42 - 64:47)
non-fossil be (64:45 - 64:49)
not as a fossil it would be water what (64:47 - 64:53)
or would it just be pure water (64:49 - 64:53)
i think it's more interesting to take a (64:59 - 65:03)
pokemon (65:01 - 65:04)
that wasn't a fossil and make it a (65:03 - 65:07)
fossil verse like i don't see how (65:04 - 65:10)
rampardos or kabutops or (65:07 - 65:12)
aerodactyl gets any more interesting (65:10 - 65:15)
than what they are (65:12 - 65:15)
like i would rather see like a fossil (65:19 - 65:24)
version of spinda that would be rad um (65:21 - 65:27)
yeah but this is in the past so why (65:24 - 65:29)
would we have fossilized version of (65:27 - 65:31)
everything from the future right now why (65:29 - 65:34)
do we have cell phones and vcr i have no (65:31 - 65:37)
idea this is this game is wild (65:34 - 65:40)
okay so i think we'll get shieldian as a (65:37 - 65:42)
pure as a as a (65:40 - 65:45)
steel fairy type but the fairy got nice (65:42 - 65:48)
nice yes (65:45 - 65:49)
you are correct (65:48 - 65:51)
because it's a castle (65:49 - 65:53)
that is my pick (65:51 - 65:56)
we will see wild roaming shielding that (65:53 - 66:00)
are uh steel fairy (65:56 - 66:00)
good (66:02 - 66:06)
call i don't do something with rock and (66:03 - 66:07)
roll (66:06 - 66:08)
i (66:07 - 66:10)
don't know that you're (66:08 - 66:13)
moving on it's demise (66:10 - 66:14)
oh no (66:13 - 66:16)
pokemon of the week (66:14 - 66:19)
all right well nobody nobody nobody (66:16 - 66:22)
nobody got pokemon of the week last week (66:19 - 66:23)
so (66:22 - 66:25)
rather than (66:23 - 66:28)
giving you a new pokemon of the week i'm (66:25 - 66:31)
going to make you all feel bad (66:28 - 66:32)
by (66:31 - 66:34)
making it slightly simpler (66:32 - 66:36)
but not still not giving it away still (66:34 - 66:38)
it's the same pokemon week so last week (66:36 - 66:40)
the clue was (66:38 - 66:42)
this is a fine to the pokemon in the (66:40 - 66:45)
tall grass kind of clue (66:42 - 66:48)
and then i said on this cool october (66:45 - 66:50)
evening the shadowy nautical creature (66:48 - 66:52)
set out to deceive (66:50 - 66:54)
all right (66:52 - 66:56)
and then everybody was like dumb eyes (66:54 - 66:57)
all my soulmates and i was like number (66:56 - 66:59)
one i've already done del mars in the (66:57 - 67:01)
past yeah but you also had done dust (66:59 - 67:04)
collapse in the past (67:01 - 67:04)
all right so this week's clue now (67:05 - 67:10)
remember it's the same pokemon because i (67:07 - 67:14)
was so disappointed that nobody got it (67:10 - 67:17)
the pokemon del mais is 12 foot 10 (67:14 - 67:21)
inches or 3.9 meters tall (67:17 - 67:24)
here is the rest of the clue (67:21 - 67:26)
why not del mars (67:24 - 67:28)
why not ghost (67:26 - 67:28)
why not (67:28 - 67:33)
grass why not dark why not water (67:28 - 67:36)
must one be these things to hide within (67:33 - 67:38)
the shadow we (67:36 - 67:42)
naughticle creature (67:38 - 67:42)
done i don't think you know what (67:43 - 67:46)
nautical means (67:44 - 67:48)
i don't you couldn't get it (67:46 - 67:49)
from that (67:48 - 67:52)
