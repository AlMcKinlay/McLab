uh (2:25 - 2:29)
but uh if there's any breaking news and (2:26 - 2:31)
then next week's episode comes out just (2:29 - 2:33)

back to 1999 to talk about an old (2:52 - 3:00)
article no no no old articles um the (2:55 - 3:02)
normally raid events get announced on (3:00 - 3:05)
Sunday night after we record somebody at (3:02 - 3:09)
Pokemon may be uh listening maybe like (3:05 - 3:10)
hey we should give people like a week's (3:09 - 3:13)
heads up here uh so our first bit of (3:10 - 3:18)
news is that there will be a love dis (3:13 - 3:21)
raids uh which will take place from (3:18 - 3:23)
Sunday February oh that starts tonight (3:21 - 3:26)
Sunday February 11th to Thursday (3:23 - 3:29)
February 15th love dis will appear in (3:26 - 3:33)
three five star Tera raids these love (3:29 - 3:35)
disc will all have fairy as their terot (3:33 - 3:38)
type prepare wisely before challenging (3:35 - 3:39)
them I don't know what that means the (3:38 - 3:41)
love dis has the wor there's no even if (3:39 - 3:43)
this was a sevenstar love disc it would (3:41 - 3:46)
not be threatening yeah I don't (3:43 - 3:47)
especially because they're all the same (3:46 - 3:50)
Terra type yeah they're all they're all (3:47 - 3:52)
fairy what's crazy about the pokemon.com (3:50 - 3:55)
article is it says de feeding love dis (3:52 - 3:58)
won't yield the heart scales of old (3:55 - 4:00)
yield heart scales (3:58 - 4:02)
[Music] (4:00 - 4:04)
Get Wrecked but you'll have a chance to (4:02 - 4:08)
receive extra sweet rewards increased (4:04 - 4:10)
amount of XP candy and rare candies (4:08 - 4:12)
perfect for training up your next team (4:10 - 4:14)
that's so funny that they they mentioned (4:12 - 4:17)
an item they got rid of uh guess what (4:14 - 4:19)
this doesn't exist anymore which was a (4:17 - 4:23)
good CH good change (4:19 - 4:23)
honestly uh I think heart scills was (4:24 - 4:28)
like one of the one things in the (4:26 - 4:31)
underground in bdsp that was like worth (4:28 - 4:33)
it cuz it was like after your 50th (4:31 - 4:36)
Sunstone you're like please I don't need (4:33 - 4:39)
another one there's only so many (4:36 - 4:42)
sunflora I can evolve I mean the heart (4:39 - 4:45)
scale is one of the reasons I always (4:42 - 4:46)
hesitate before selling everything in (4:45 - 4:50)
the treasures folder of my item (4:46 - 4:53)
bag yeah but you don't need them anymore (4:50 - 4:55)
now at least in this game yeah nothing (4:53 - 4:58)
in this game not even the bamboo I think (4:55 - 5:00)
that's the one I was unsure about (4:58 - 5:02)
in scarlet and violet they said there (5:00 - 5:05)
were collectors oh yeah but there are no (5:02 - 5:07)
collectors there are no collectors (5:05 - 5:10)
that's that's a hot (5:07 - 5:12)
lie well I mean I suppose in sword and (5:10 - 5:14)
shield there's the one (5:12 - 5:17)
guy (5:14 - 5:20)
who in whatever town was outside the (5:17 - 5:22)
fighting gym slash was it fighting Ghost (5:20 - 5:24)
Gym that would be like hey hey if you (5:22 - 5:28)
have this item I'll pay extra money for (5:24 - 5:28)
it yes and I think there was one item (5:28 - 5:35)
where it was better to merge it in the (5:32 - 5:37)
camatic before you sold it I think it (5:35 - 5:39)
was like the Bal mushroom or something (5:37 - 5:41)
yeah where you got a little bit more but (5:39 - 5:43)
like the hassle of doing it it was like (5:41 - 5:47)
ah I don't know the (5:43 - 5:49)
hassle it was never worth the hassle (5:47 - 5:52)
ever no I don't think (5:49 - 5:55)
so um then they announced another set of (5:52 - 5:58)
raids so love dis ends on Thursday and (5:55 - 6:02)
Thursday night you central time but (5:58 - 6:05)
midnight UTC uh so assuming that there (6:02 - 6:07)
would be another sevenstar but there (6:05 - 6:10)
wasn't they're doing instead this is (6:07 - 6:13)
also off pokemon.com stonejourner ice Q (6:10 - 6:15)
armor Rouge and suru Edge are coming to (6:13 - 6:18)
ter raid battles that will start (6:15 - 6:21)
Thursday uh February 15th and it will go (6:18 - 6:23)
until Sunday February (6:21 - 6:26)
18th they will be appearing in three and (6:23 - 6:29)
five star tarot raids for both scarlet (6:26 - 6:30)
and violet (6:29 - 6:32)
during this time Stone Jer ice CU armor (6:30 - 6:34)
Rouge and suru Edge at terrade Crystals (6:32 - 6:36)
throughout the Pala region these Pokemon (6:34 - 6:38)
have various terot (6:36 - 6:42)
types um and I think this (6:38 - 6:46)
is the first time where they're (6:42 - 6:48)
actually maybe not the first maybe the (6:46 - 6:50)
second time where these are not version (6:48 - 6:52)
exclusive they're supposed to appear in (6:50 - 6:56)
both games that's what you mean yes yeah (6:52 - 7:00)
yeah they are version exclus exus (6:56 - 7:03)
but they're not being tied to the game (7:00 - 7:05)
they appear in and you have to connect (7:03 - 7:07)
to the internet you should be able to (7:05 - 7:12)
see all four in whatever game you (7:07 - 7:12)
own (7:12 - 7:17)
which it's been a year so yeah I feel (7:14 - 7:20)
like I feel like people have these by (7:17 - 7:22)
now because they would randomly show up (7:20 - 7:24)
if you're just checking raids anyways in (7:22 - 7:27)
somebody else's game like that's how I (7:24 - 7:30)
got most of these the the always someone (7:27 - 7:32)
trying to complete the Pokédex the vend (7:30 - 7:34)
diagram of people that don't have (7:32 - 7:36)
Nintendo online and still don't have a (7:34 - 7:38)
sural edge seems very high on my (7:36 - 7:42)
Instagram post they're very excited so (7:38 - 7:44)
like I'm excited for them they can (7:42 - 7:47)
finally get a Sur (7:44 - 7:50)
Edge good for (7:47 - 7:54)
them Sur Edge would be but more people (7:50 - 7:58)
got Violet okay oh yeah look those those (7:54 - 8:01)
Violet players (7:58 - 8:03)
they they just couldn't get the Nintendo (8:01 - 8:06)
online um I think this makes sense like (8:03 - 8:08)
at at a certain point like just make it (8:06 - 8:12)
easy to get yeah for for people who (8:08 - 8:13)
legitimately don't have Nintendo online (8:12 - 8:15)
like that's good for them we are well (8:13 - 8:19)
into the life of this game at this point (8:15 - 8:22)
just start giving these things away also (8:19 - 8:24)
like a lot of people probably got this (8:22 - 8:26)
game for Christmas and it's only been (8:24 - 8:28)
like two months for them (8:26 - 8:30)
so I know for me like ceru and armor (8:28 - 8:32)
Rouge were like some of the last in my (8:30 - 8:34)
Pokedex because I didn't want to evolve (8:32 - 8:38)
it via Char Cadet I was like I'll just (8:34 - 8:39)
I'm not worried about it it'll pop up in (8:38 - 8:41)
a raid eventually and I'll catch it and (8:39 - 8:42)
then I don't have to worry about that (8:41 - 8:45)
Evolution (8:42 - 8:50)
cycle uh nothing about um as of this (8:45 - 8:53)
podcast nothing about a mass outbreak I (8:50 - 8:54)
was (8:53 - 8:57)
actually surprised well not like (8:54 - 8:59)
surprised that they I would be surprised (8:57 - 9:01)
if they don't do one like I I would (8:59 - 9:04)
still maybe assume that there would be (9:01 - 9:06)
like a tandem Mouse outbreak or (9:04 - 9:08)
something for Valentine's (9:06 - 9:10)
Day uh maybe they announce that tonight (9:08 - 9:13)
after we record but that's always (9:10 - 9:15)
possible but they've already kind of (9:13 - 9:18)
announced the Valentine's Day (9:15 - 9:21)
event uh the oh the the the love disc (9:18 - 9:22)
the love dis yeah yeah I feel like if (9:21 - 9:23)
they would have announced it it would (9:22 - 9:24)
have been (9:23 - 9:28)
with um the the love dis (9:24 - 9:31)
but I I think I think the mass outbreak (9:28 - 9:35)
and like small not that exciting raid (9:31 - 9:38)
kind of goes well together but it's (9:35 - 9:41)
fine maybe they actually knew for once (9:38 - 9:44)
that like hey it's no they're going to (9:41 - 9:45)
do the Seven Star raid next weekend (9:44 - 9:48)
where everyone will want be like Oh I'm (9:45 - 9:50)
not I'm like we're doing the world the (9:48 - 9:54)
world uh CNO Global (9:50 - 9:57)
thing which is not this coming weekend (9:54 - 9:58)
but next (9:57 - 10:02)
yeah this coming weekend is c tour be c (9:58 - 10:06)
tour yeah I'm speaking as if it's (10:02 - 10:08)
Monday (10:06 - 10:10)
yeah trying to do all the day (10:08 - 10:12)
calculations in my head especially after (10:10 - 10:17)
we recorded the posts tour right right (10:12 - 10:20)
yesterday um and this also makes sense (10:17 - 10:22)
because or not makes sense but this this (10:20 - 10:24)
uh suu Edge ties (10:22 - 10:27)
into the little suu Edge versus (10:24 - 10:30)
dragapult short that they showed off um (10:27 - 10:32)
which the real star of that short was (10:30 - 10:34)
the little gim ghoul and (10:32 - 10:38)
then they I I think this is the first (10:34 - 10:40)
time they've acknowledged Pokemon day (10:38 - 10:43)
for the year where they said that the (10:40 - 10:45)
suru Edge card would be available with (10:43 - 10:49)
the Pokemon day stamp at GameStop Best (10:45 - 10:52)
Buy and Pokemon Center with PCH the card (10:49 - 10:55)
is free minus you got to buy something (10:52 - 10:57)
because capitalism (10:55 - 11:01)
exists so um I think that was their (10:57 - 11:05)
first acknowledgement of Pokemon (11:01 - 11:07)
day I don't think there was anything (11:05 - 11:09)
before (11:07 - 11:09)
that yeah it's it's mostly just been fan (11:10 - 11:18)
speculation of all the (11:14 - 11:18)
things leave it to Pokemon fans to (11:18 - 11:24)
overhype something that hasn't (11:20 - 11:24)
been uh yeah the the the short was (11:27 - 11:35)
called suru Edge Rumble in the (11:31 - 11:35)
ruins and then the card on Pokemon (11:36 - 11:41)
Center and the raids and then it says (11:39 - 11:45)
meet suru Edge and it's trainer Amo amio (11:41 - 11:48)
amio right is that how you say it amio (11:45 - 11:51)
in Pokemon Horizons coming to Netflix on (11:48 - 11:52)
March (11:51 - 11:55)
7th and also (11:52 - 11:58)
technically uh there's a surage themed (11:55 - 12:00)
coin card sleeves deck box that you can (11:58 - 12:04)
get through February 26 if you earn (12:00 - 12:10)
rewards on the ranked ladder in TCG (12:04 - 12:14)
L not TCG that shut (12:10 - 12:16)
down uh rewards are available until (12:14 - 12:18)
February (12:16 - 12:21)
22nd (12:18 - 12:21)
so good old I yeah I I I think surage is (12:23 - 12:30)
more popular than armor Rouge (12:27 - 12:32)
I think so it definitely was at the (12:30 - 12:34)
beginning yeah maybe armor Rouge gets (12:32 - 12:37)
its Spotlight later this year maybe (12:34 - 12:40)
not who (12:37 - 12:42)
knows uh speaking of (12:40 - 12:45)
popular uh a bunch of (12:42 - 12:49)
popular streamers and YouTubers made a (12:45 - 12:54)
uh Esports organization I let me let me (12:49 - 12:57)
I have the Wikipedia up here 100 thieves (12:54 - 12:59)
is an American Lifestyle brand and (12:57 - 13:03)
gaming organization based in Los Angeles (12:59 - 13:08)
yeah founded in 2017 by n shot uh the (13:03 - 13:09)
organization I don't know why I said (13:08 - 13:12)
organization funny complet in several (13:09 - 13:13)
video games including Call of Duty (13:12 - 13:15)
League of Legends and (13:13 - 13:18)
valerant (13:15 - 13:18)
um and then they they they have a very (13:19 - 13:24)
big Wikipedia about their three big (13:22 - 13:27)
Esports teams which I just named uh they (13:24 - 13:28)
used to do Counterstrike apparently they (13:27 - 13:29)
don't do that anymore (13:28 - 13:32)
more um now why are you saying this what (13:29 - 13:34)
does aund thieves have to do with a (13:32 - 13:35)
Pokemon (13:34 - 13:37)
podcast Pokemon partnered with them (13:35 - 13:41)
which was guess what actually (13:37 - 13:41)
crazy apparently this uh this (13:41 - 13:46)
partnership was in the works for quite a (13:44 - 13:51)
while um there's like I don't follow (13:46 - 13:53)
Esports that closely I know there's a (13:51 - 13:57)
bunch of different teams out there and (13:53 - 14:00)
there's smaller teams like obviously (13:57 - 14:03)
Pokemon unite has a bunch of their (14:00 - 14:05)
Esports teams that they trade players (14:03 - 14:08)
and and that was like weird to I was (14:05 - 14:10)
watching the unite stuff yesterday as I (14:08 - 14:13)
was cleaning my office and it was kind (14:10 - 14:15)
of crazy for them to be like oh this (14:13 - 14:17)
player used to be on this team another (14:15 - 14:18)
on this team and I was like what when (14:17 - 14:21)
did this happen also why we like we're (14:18 - 14:23)
we're like it's cool that they're like (14:21 - 14:24)
talking about like trading like (14:23 - 14:26)
basketball players or like football (14:24 - 14:28)
players I was like oh I that's actually (14:26 - 14:30)
crazy they're on a different team but (14:28 - 14:31)
okay (14:30 - 14:35)
sure no one's picking karand this is why (14:31 - 14:37)
pick the cram a lot of Eevees were being (14:35 - 14:39)
picked yesterday no yeah (14:37 - 14:42)
E's eeve is just popular and good in (14:39 - 14:44)
that game yeah a lot of a lot of eeve (14:42 - 14:46)
getting picked (14:44 - 14:49)
um but uh 100 thieves is pretty (14:46 - 14:53)
big uh what's the what's the I'm trying (14:49 - 14:56)
to think of other teams anyways 100 (14:53 - 14:59)
thieves is partnered with other brands (14:56 - 15:02)
they partnered with uh um Dragon Ball Z (14:59 - 15:03)
at one (15:02 - 15:07)
point which that that all that if you (15:03 - 15:08)
like Dragon Ball Z and you're listening (15:07 - 15:10)
to the show and you like 100 thieves uh (15:08 - 15:12)
all the Dragon Ball Z stuff's on sale (15:10 - 15:14)
right now I don't think it's (15:12 - 15:16)
sold I don't think it's sold as well as (15:14 - 15:19)
Pokemon uh but they launched a Pokemon (15:16 - 15:21)
collection (15:19 - 15:25)
yesterday and it's sold out it did it it (15:21 - 15:27)
did sell out I think the the thing that (15:25 - 15:29)
sold out right away were the shirt there (15:27 - 15:32)
were four shirts if I say four shirts (15:29 - 15:34)
you can probably exactly pinpoint which (15:32 - 15:36)
Pokemon they (15:34 - 15:38)
are can let you know uh it's going to be (15:36 - 15:40)
Pikachu Squirtle Bulbasaur and (15:38 - 15:43)
Charmander yep I think if you signed up (15:40 - 15:46)
for the 100 thieves mailing list you got (15:43 - 15:49)
in 15 minutes before everyone else and (15:46 - 15:51)
it was like the shirts were pretty much (15:49 - 15:54)
sold out because of that mailing list (15:51 - 15:57)
the shirt's reasonably priced at (15:54 - 16:01)
$38 um for for a cross collab like (15:57 - 16:05)
luxury brand that's cheaper than luxury (16:01 - 16:07)
brand I don't know yeah consider (16:05 - 16:10)
Lifestyle brand it's a Lifestyle brand I (16:07 - 16:12)
don't get there a luxury brand yeah I (16:10 - 16:14)
don't think it's luxury (16:12 - 16:17)
i$1 Hood isn't luxury I think they (16:14 - 16:20)
charge in that price I don't think it's (16:17 - 16:21)
I don't think it's necessarily worth it (16:20 - 16:24)
also a $100 hoodie (16:21 - 16:28)
is for but it's cheap for a luxury brand (16:24 - 16:30)
Puma is that a Lu yeah you can have (16:28 - 16:32)
different price levels of (16:30 - 16:35)
luxury I don't think this is luxury and (16:32 - 16:39)
also once again it's just Pokemon (16:35 - 16:43)
slapped on a shirt yeah it's stock (16:39 - 16:45)
images the Charizard on the hoodie is (16:43 - 16:48)
unique I've never seen that one before (16:45 - 16:50)
where he's flying upwards with thieves (16:48 - 16:54)
behind it (16:50 - 16:54)
sure yeah I guess okay (16:55 - 17:03)
you got something I did I did I got the (16:59 - 17:06)
I I I agree with Hannah 100% it is the (17:03 - 17:10)
classic slap a Pokemon with the logo (17:06 - 17:13)
although you know the the Charmander is (17:10 - 17:15)
sleeping on the 100 thieves that's you (17:13 - 17:18)
know that's not the (17:15 - 17:21)
standard Bulbapedia PNG that you always (17:18 - 17:22)
see of just Charmander which was slapped (17:21 - 17:25)
on to the skateboards (17:22 - 17:29)
for um gosh what was that skateboard so (17:25 - 17:32)
mad that that skateboard didn't uh Santa (17:29 - 17:35)
no not Santa (17:32 - 17:35)
Monica anyways I got the Charizard (17:35 - 17:42)
pants oh the one pair of pants I got the (17:38 - 17:45)
cordoy the corduroy pants I thought $100 (17:42 - 17:49)
for a pair of pants isn't too bad um (17:45 - 17:50)
especially when (17:49 - 17:55)
you're go on have you worn a lot of (17:50 - 17:55)
corduroy uh no I hate corduroy (17:55 - 18:01)
that's a (18:00 - 18:03)
choice you know I'm trying to get back (18:01 - 18:06)
into it you know what what's to get into (18:03 - 18:08)
you make weird noises whenever you're (18:06 - 18:11)
walking it's mostly (18:08 - 18:11)
uncomfortable I grew up at cord it's (18:12 - 18:18)
awful here's here's why I hate corduroy (18:15 - 18:21)
cuz I felt like I was forced like I (18:18 - 18:24)
corduroy was like the church pants when (18:21 - 18:26)
I was went to church like four times as (18:24 - 18:27)
a (18:26 - 18:31)
kid is this not I thought that was khaki (18:27 - 18:33)
okay no I (18:31 - 18:37)
mean Cory Fell From Grace for valid and (18:33 - 18:41)
good reasons cuz corday is (18:37 - 18:44)
awful uh and it was replaced by khakis (18:41 - 18:47)
so khaki became the much the (18:44 - 18:50)
professional pant that replaced Cordy (18:47 - 18:53)
cordury is terrible it is uncomfortable (18:50 - 18:56)
but they have a texture to them yeah (18:53 - 18:59)
when you walk in them that texture rubs (18:56 - 19:02)
against itself and you make weird noises (18:59 - 19:04)
all (19:02 - 19:07)
you everybody who walks go back to the (19:04 - 19:09)
70s when I grew up with every teacher (19:07 - 19:12)
walking down the Coro going and every (19:09 - 19:13)
kid who had to wear (19:12 - 19:16)
C was noisy and (19:13 - 19:20)
terrible it's awful you (19:16 - 19:22)
I you don't think corduroy technology (19:20 - 19:25)
has changed in the last 27 years what uh (19:22 - 19:29)
what about ridges on pants has changed (19:25 - 19:31)
it is unless they are putting some sort (19:29 - 19:34)
of soft part in between your thighs so (19:31 - 19:37)
they don't rub together that is gonna (19:34 - 19:39)
make noise it can be made of a different (19:37 - 19:41)
material that changes things it says it (19:39 - 19:48)
says mid midday midday mid mday curay (19:41 - 19:51)
fabc I I think I think these pants look (19:48 - 19:54)
tight though like it is not the it is (19:51 - 19:56)
not the like let's just slap a Pokemon (19:54 - 19:59)
on a piece of clothing like it looks (19:56 - 20:01)
like they put the most effort into the (19:59 - 20:03)
pants it is the one pair of pants (20:01 - 20:05)
everything else is either sweatshirt (20:03 - 20:07)
hoodie (20:05 - 20:11)
t-shirt and it stands out not in a bad (20:07 - 20:13)
way I know I know you're I know your (20:11 - 20:16)
vest person Hannah they did a vest they (20:13 - 20:19)
did yeah I looked real hard at that vest (20:16 - 20:21)
trying to even picture what I would look (20:19 - 20:23)
like in it and I (20:21 - 20:25)
can't the vest was more expensive than (20:23 - 20:27)
the pants and I think there's more (20:25 - 20:31)
material in the pants the vest was 139 (20:27 - 20:34)
the vest has how many six pockets it's (20:31 - 20:35)
got a lot of (20:34 - 20:38)
pockets it's got too many pockets it has (20:35 - 20:40)
lots of pockets and that's not a bad (20:38 - 20:41)
thing pockets are (20:40 - 20:44)
necessary not that many pockets I'll (20:41 - 20:47)
take all the pockets I can get look they (20:44 - 20:49)
are in awkward positions that's never (20:47 - 20:53)
stopped me before well I I almost got (20:49 - 20:54)
the (20:53 - 20:57)
cardigan cuz I what was that one drop (20:54 - 20:59)
with the Pikachu card cardigan it was a (20:57 - 21:01)
yellow cardigan with the Pikachu face it (20:59 - 21:03)
was really simple that was a luxury (21:01 - 21:06)
brand too um I mean the cardigan is (21:03 - 21:08)
still in (21:06 - 21:11)
stock yeah but uh I liked I was like (21:08 - 21:13)
okay cool simple black Pikachu cardigan (21:11 - 21:16)
but I didn't like the back of it which (21:13 - 21:20)
is like a pixel version of the words 100 (21:16 - 21:24)
thieves yeah no that's valid I (21:20 - 21:24)
don't I don't like being an (21:24 - 21:28)
advertisement for things that I pay for (21:26 - 21:31)
for I don't like their company's giant (21:28 - 21:34)
logos on things that I don't necessarily (21:31 - 21:38)
support like if it was just the Pokemon (21:34 - 21:40)
i' be like okay fine I don't care that (21:38 - 21:42)
it's made by this group but with their (21:40 - 21:43)
giant thing and The Blaze on the back I (21:42 - 21:45)
feel like I'm supporting this Lifestyle (21:43 - 21:48)
brand company that I know nothing about (21:45 - 21:50)
that I'm only buying for Pokemon all (21:48 - 21:52)
these are pretty much a hard know for me (21:50 - 21:53)
because of that except for maybe the (21:52 - 21:55)
Corduroy plants if they weren't corduroy (21:53 - 21:59)
oh but thousand jacket are (21:55 - 22:03)
you what is happening that's the luxury (21:59 - 22:05)
part the luxury of having $1,000 to (22:03 - 22:09)
spend on a jacket the Pikachu Shera (22:05 - 22:12)
fleece jacket has no 100 themes branding (22:09 - 22:15)
on it yes and while it is just the (22:12 - 22:18)
Pikachu silhouette they put like little (22:15 - 22:20)
Pikachu Footprints all over it and it's (22:18 - 22:23)
really cute I think maybe that's why one (22:20 - 22:25)
of the that maybe that's why it's one of (22:23 - 22:28)
the things that's sold out yeah yeah (22:25 - 22:30)
it's it's super super cute I'm looking (22:28 - 22:32)
at the pictures I don't see it say 100 (22:30 - 22:33)
thieves anywhere no don't either oh it (22:32 - 22:35)
says it on like the little zipper pull (22:33 - 22:38)
tag but like oh that's fine that you (22:35 - 22:39)
that's impossible to see unless oh it (22:38 - 22:42)
says it on the it says it on the uh (22:39 - 22:45)
sleeve cuff but that's also impossible (22:42 - 22:47)
to see because it's black yeah that's (22:45 - 22:49)
that's my that's my jam right there (22:47 - 22:50)
impossible to (22:49 - 22:53)
see um oh wait no it doesn't it say it (22:50 - 22:56)
right up by the collar bone too does it (22:53 - 22:59)
oh it does but it's so so hard to (22:56 - 23:02)
see but yeah I see I see it now I see it (22:59 - 23:04)
I thought that was another foot oh no (23:02 - 23:08)
I'm out I'm out again I'm out no but I (23:04 - 23:09)
think I think that's I think that's like (23:08 - 23:12)
the subtle look maybe some people (23:09 - 23:15)
want look like I'm I I don't I don't (23:12 - 23:17)
want to say who is this (23:15 - 23:20)
for because like uh clearly there's a (23:17 - 23:22)
lot of like very popular content (23:20 - 23:25)
creators that are with 100 thieves like (23:22 - 23:27)
Nate shot is very popular uh I think V (23:25 - 23:29)
valky (23:27 - 23:31)
um I think she's a co-owner of 100 (23:29 - 23:34)
thieves like they have big communities (23:31 - 23:36)
and when they do drop stuff it does (23:34 - 23:37)
normally sell (23:36 - 23:42)
out so I'm curious of how many like I I (23:37 - 23:44)
guess I am one I like one person that (23:42 - 23:46)
bought something that I'm not a 100 (23:44 - 23:47)
thieves fan but I thought the (23:46 - 23:50)
collaboration was kind of cool and I was (23:47 - 23:52)
like let me get these pants (23:50 - 23:56)
um but I am curious what that crossover (23:52 - 23:58)
is I mean I guess I guess it's doing the (23:56 - 23:59)
thing that they want to achieve which is (23:58 - 24:02)
like bring those two markets together (23:59 - 24:04)
which is like everything they're doing (24:02 - 24:06)
with with cross Brands um yeah that's (24:04 - 24:08)
why they keep doing it yeah that's why (24:06 - 24:09)
they keep doing it and then they got (24:08 - 24:12)
then like as Greg Greg said there's a A1 (24:09 - 24:14)
thousand well not $1 thousand it's (24:12 - 24:17)
actually only (24:14 - 24:17)
$998 it's not in the four digits um it's (24:17 - 24:23)
a Varity like saying something's $9.99 (24:21 - 24:25)
it's not (24:23 - 24:29)
$10 varsity jacket uh you will be paying (24:25 - 24:32)
over $1,000 to in either (24:29 - 24:36)
tax and shipping Either Ore that is over (24:32 - 24:39)
$1,000 when all is said and done so it (24:36 - 24:41)
looks like uh small and extra large sold (24:39 - 24:43)
out but the jacket is still in stock if (24:41 - 24:45)
you're listening to this uh it looks (24:43 - 24:48)
like it's handmade in San Francisco by (24:45 - 24:52)
Golden Bear sportsware black meltin wool (24:48 - 24:55)
black premium (24:52 - 24:55)
leather I don't know know that much (24:56 - 25:00)
about clothes I know when something's (24:59 - 25:03)
real leather it's usually more expensive (25:00 - 25:05)
yeah and varsity jackets are are (25:03 - 25:08)
expensive just at a base level when (25:05 - 25:11)
they're not fancy with logos on them (25:08 - 25:13)
this isn't this doesn't have a lot of (25:11 - 25:15)
leather on it right it's just the (25:13 - 25:17)
sleeves yeah it's not a full leather (25:15 - 25:21)
jacket it is a varsity jacket so (25:17 - 25:23)
like it's in (25:21 - 25:26)
line with what you would pay for some (25:23 - 25:29)
varsity jackets but also (25:26 - 25:33)
yeah I feel like 200 to 500 is a (25:29 - 25:35)
standard High School varsity jacket (25:33 - 25:36)
that's why I had like three letters and (25:35 - 25:39)
no jacket (25:36 - 25:41)
yeah would you guys remember the like (25:39 - 25:43)
the Rings they would sell you in high (25:41 - 25:46)
school yes Craig did you get one of (25:43 - 25:50)
those Rings were you no why no there was (25:46 - 25:52)
nothing about (25:50 - 25:55)
paying the only thing I paid for bucks (25:52 - 25:57)
wasn't it oh yeah the only thing I paid (25:55 - 25:59)
for (25:57 - 26:03)
for high school was my (25:59 - 26:06)
yearbook there was the only thing I was (26:03 - 26:08)
willing to pay I'm not buying your (26:06 - 26:11)
jacket if you want me to advertise my (26:08 - 26:14)
school give it to me for free I don't (26:11 - 26:17)
think and I I also looked at those all (26:14 - 26:18)
that stuff I said (26:17 - 26:22)
so if I buy this and wear this out I am (26:18 - 26:24)
literally telling the world I peaked in (26:22 - 26:26)
high school and that is the saddest most (26:24 - 26:28)
pathetic thing that I could do (26:26 - 26:33)
as as a life goal as a fashion choice (26:28 - 26:36)
because if I paid that much money I'm (26:33 - 26:40)
wearing it which is just sad all the way (26:36 - 26:45)
down so no hard no hard (26:40 - 26:45)
pass Hannah's going to roll over the (26:46 - 26:54)
three that she got the what on I did not (26:48 - 26:56)
get those rings I thought they were fun (26:54 - 26:58)
to design oh yeah they're design I'd (26:56 - 27:00)
spend time with the create this just (26:58 - 27:02)
like character creators yeah this is a (27:00 - 27:04)
cool design I'm not paying for this uh (27:02 - 27:06)
on average on (27:04 - 27:11)
Amazon uh varsity jacket is about 100 (27:06 - 27:16)
bucks really yeah now now I don't know (27:11 - 27:18)
how real leathery some of these things (27:16 - 27:21)
are but they're not that (27:18 - 27:24)
expensive we we should take the we we (27:21 - 27:26)
should pull in some money get the (27:24 - 27:28)
varsity jacket and then make it to the (27:26 - 27:30)
leather guy on Tik Tok and then have him (27:28 - 27:34)
cut it up and tell us if the leather was (27:30 - 27:38)
worth the $1,000 the leather guy on Tik (27:34 - 27:39)
Tok yeah yeah yeah he takes like he (27:38 - 27:41)
takes like luxury like he does take (27:39 - 27:44)
luxury Brands like coach or or GUI or (27:41 - 27:46)
like whatever and then oh I think I know (27:44 - 27:49)
who you're talking about the leather guy (27:46 - 27:52)
threw me off yeah yeah yeah like have I (27:49 - 27:54)
have different leather people that I (27:52 - 27:57)
follow on oh I see yeah yeah not that (27:54 - 27:59)
one (27:57 - 28:02)
no like he cut up like the leather like (27:59 - 28:03)
apple case before Apple got rid of (28:02 - 28:05)
leather and he was like oh like this is (28:03 - 28:07)
actually like the like they use a really (28:05 - 28:09)
nice leather it's really worth it is (28:07 - 28:11)
worth it like if you spend how much was (28:09 - 28:13)
like a apple leather case was like 50 (28:11 - 28:14)
bucks for your phone it was like 50 (28:13 - 28:16)
bucks yeah but he was like yeah no this (28:14 - 28:18)
is worth 50 bucks based on like the (28:16 - 28:20)
quality of leather they use it's really (28:18 - 28:21)
interesting because they're like I would (28:20 - 28:23)
like I wouldn't know like what's good (28:21 - 28:25)
leather what's (28:23 - 28:28)
not cut it up (28:25 - 28:31)
uh yeah (28:28 - 28:35)
content so most of this stock is is sold (28:31 - 28:37)
out and like there it does look if you (28:35 - 28:40)
click on things it it like a lot of the (28:37 - 28:43)
sizes are sold out but like the Pikachu (28:40 - 28:45)
hoodie they only got medium and large in (28:43 - 28:49)
stock um but all the shirts are gone (28:45 - 28:50)
Gengar hoodie is (28:49 - 28:54)
gone cardigan only has oh cardigan all (28:50 - 28:56)
cardigan all (28:54 - 28:58)
there um but but like you know what's (28:56 - 29:00)
interesting about like drops like this (28:58 - 29:02)
this is like the last thing we'll say (29:00 - 29:04)
before we take a break I feel like if (29:02 - 29:07)
it if it doesn't sell out within the (29:04 - 29:12)
first hour it kind of sits there oh (29:07 - 29:12)
yeah for sure I I purposely I knew it (29:13 - 29:19)
was going to drop at two and I was like (29:17 - 29:22)
you know what I don't want to spend the (29:19 - 29:24)
money like I would like something of (29:22 - 29:26)
course because I would like to see the (29:24 - 29:29)
quality show it off talk about it um tax (29:26 - 29:32)
right off so I went on two hours later (29:29 - 29:34)
and the thing I wanted which was the (29:32 - 29:35)
pants were still in stock and I was like (29:34 - 29:36)
okay I guess I'll order a pair of pants (29:35 - 29:38)
like $100 for a pair of pants it's like (29:36 - 29:39)
whatever (29:38 - 29:43)
like um I can literally wear them so (29:39 - 29:44)
it's not like they're going to sit in a (29:43 - 29:46)
closet unless they're uncomfortable then (29:44 - 29:47)
I'm not going to wear them and going to (29:46 - 29:48)
come on the show and I'm say Greg was (29:47 - 29:51)
100% right (29:48 - 29:55)
I'm you're GNA you're going to bring on (29:51 - 29:57)
the madness to yourself by whipping (29:55 - 29:59)
around as you walk but I ordered the (29:57 - 30:02)
pants and the pants are still in stock (29:59 - 30:03)
as of this (30:02 - 30:05)
recording (30:03 - 30:08)
so I feel like that's a I I prefer being (30:05 - 30:11)
in that situation to what it was with (30:08 - 30:13)
the skateboards and all that where it's (30:11 - 30:15)
all getting bought out by scalpers and (30:13 - 30:18)
nobody can actually get a hold of the (30:15 - 30:21)
items so I'm sure there's a balance I'm (30:18 - 30:24)
sure part of the reason this one isn't (30:21 - 30:27)
selling out that way is because it's not (30:24 - 30:29)
limited in the same way and it's mostly (30:27 - 30:31)
just Pokemon slapped on pieces of (30:29 - 30:35)
clothing yep but it's still nice that (30:31 - 30:38)
they're still available honestly I mean (30:35 - 30:40)
are they do is this like the only run (30:38 - 30:43)
they're doing I think so I know on (30:40 - 30:45)
Friday night they had a big event at (30:43 - 30:48)
their office building Warehouse (30:45 - 30:51)
something like that uh where there were (30:48 - 30:52)
some there were some people there (30:51 - 30:54)
posting pictures of the launch but I (30:52 - 30:56)
don't think that was unique to Pokemon I (30:54 - 30:57)
think they just do that anytime they (30:56 - 30:59)

checking because new pins will arrive (34:39 - 34:44)
every month and for (34:41 - 34:44)
2024 there's one bit of advice I got in (34:45 - 34:51)
my (34:49 - 34:54)
20s that I think is actually (34:51 - 34:58)
true and that is if you wore the Trend (34:54 - 35:00)
the first time it came around you are (34:58 - 35:03)
too old to wear it again the second time (35:00 - 35:05)
it came around (35:03 - 35:08)
I was littered with pins in high school (35:05 - 35:11)
your jacket that was a thing not on my (35:08 - 35:13)
varsity jacket on my jeans jacket my (35:11 - 35:15)
acid watch jeans jacket thank you very (35:13 - 35:19)
much it was very stylish the thought of (35:15 - 35:22)
putting pins on my clothing or anything (35:19 - 35:23)
I (35:22 - 35:26)
own is abhorent to me at this point (35:23 - 35:28)
first of all I don't have the back (35:26 - 35:32)
strength anymore to carry that much (35:28 - 35:32)
metal second I lost a pin in a theater (35:32 - 35:38)
in New York and it was like devastating (35:36 - 35:41)
to teenage me because that pin had so (35:38 - 35:44)
much meaning can I name the pen on that (35:41 - 35:47)
I cannot I cannot tell you what I lost (35:44 - 35:49)
what it was I do remember scouring most (35:47 - 35:52)
of New York trying to find it because I (35:49 - 35:54)
was 16 and my life was over at that (35:52 - 35:56)
point because I lost this (35:54 - 35:57)
pen (35:56 - 35:59)
I (35:57 - 36:02)
just welcome back it's back for all you (35:59 - 36:04)
people who love it this time around have (36:02 - 36:09)
fun with it I'm not sure it ever fully (36:04 - 36:13)
left H I feel like it's been like what I (36:09 - 36:15)
don't follow Disney I'm not a Disney (36:13 - 36:16)
person at all but it's been pretty (36:15 - 36:18)
popular at like Disney parks for quite a (36:16 - 36:20)
while right yeah I mean so the pin (36:18 - 36:22)
exchange at Disney Parks is a collecting (36:20 - 36:25)
thing not a sort of a wearing thing the (36:22 - 36:28)
pins on clothing (36:25 - 36:30)
them though for sure oh yeah I mean we (36:28 - 36:32)
you can't talk about how Wild Disney (36:30 - 36:35)
adults are and the whole pin (36:32 - 36:37)
exchange that's like a that's like a (36:35 - 36:41)
whole Disney podcast worth of talking (36:37 - 36:44)
when we went to Disney I saw all of the (36:41 - 36:46)
pin people going to the pin boards at (36:44 - 36:48)
everything being like hey what do you (36:46 - 36:50)
have wait are there like are there like (36:48 - 36:54)
designated spots that you must go yes in (36:50 - 36:56)
our hotel in the lobby you could go to (36:54 - 36:57)
one spot and the guy was there and they' (36:56 - 36:59)
be like okay can I see what you have in (36:57 - 37:00)
the pin exchange and you'd roll this (36:59 - 37:03)
thing out and turn it around to the all (37:00 - 37:05)
these pins and they would put one on and (37:03 - 37:06)
take the one that they needed it's like (37:05 - 37:10)
a it is the wildest thing is it like do (37:06 - 37:12)
do you have to exchange or are people (37:10 - 37:14)
just saying like I'll give you like $10 (37:12 - 37:15)
for this it's an exchange I think (37:14 - 37:18)
there's some that let you just just take (37:15 - 37:20)
one if there's a lot of them but mostly (37:18 - 37:22)
it's exchange you have to give something (37:20 - 37:25)
to get (37:22 - 37:27)
something so this isn't like the (37:25 - 37:28)
Japanese Pokémon worlds where like (37:27 - 37:30)
everyone's just laying out cards in the (37:28 - 37:33)
hallway and no I mean no one's actually (37:30 - 37:35)
trading they're just literally (37:33 - 37:38)
exchanging money yeah and I mean there's (37:35 - 37:40)
so in the stores there are this the (37:38 - 37:42)
giant like all the new pins are just out (37:40 - 37:45)
like just rows and rows and rows and (37:42 - 37:46)
rows of all the new pins but if you want (37:45 - 37:50)
older stuff that's where like the pin (37:46 - 37:53)
exchange comes in or the eBay where (37:50 - 37:56)
people go buy things off of eBay it's a (37:53 - 37:58)
whole it's a whole thing it's just a (37:56 - 38:01)
whole (37:58 - 38:01)
thing and Pokemon seems to have realized (38:03 - 38:07)
that they have over a thousand creatures (38:05 - 38:10)
that they can make multiple pins of each (38:07 - 38:13)
a money maker for sure am I tempted by (38:10 - 38:16)
the max Calibur pin absolutely will I (38:13 - 38:19)
ever buy it no because I liveed through (38:16 - 38:21)
it the first time and I can't go back (38:19 - 38:22)
there's nothing wrong with buying one (38:21 - 38:25)
pin Greg you can put on your backpack (38:22 - 38:28)
what backpack do I carry around (38:25 - 38:31)
H one that you'll need to backpack (38:28 - 38:34)
with I mean you don't want to take a pin (38:31 - 38:36)
backpacking yeah no that's gonna get (38:34 - 38:39)
lost EAS the back you got to get the (38:36 - 38:42)
safety locks they're like it's like $5 (38:39 - 38:44)
for like 20 of them that was like $20 (38:42 - 38:47)
for one no no no no no no you can get (38:44 - 38:48)
like a whole little box thingy off (38:47 - 38:52)
Amazon the little the Safety Lock in (38:48 - 38:55)
pins I can't remember they're called (38:52 - 38:56)
just I think if you just search for pin (38:55 - 38:59)
lock or something on Amazon HL covers a (38:56 - 39:02)
lot so a stronger pin back I know I've (38:59 - 39:03)
heard that they exist I feel like I (39:02 - 39:05)
looked them up because I've definitely (39:03 - 39:08)
lost a pin before yeah yeah yeah yeah (39:05 - 39:10)
yeah I I always got the pin locks (39:08 - 39:11)
because I I felt like I got like a (39:10 - 39:13)
hundred for like 20 bucks or something (39:11 - 39:15)
at one point and then I'm assuming (39:13 - 39:18)
locking pin backs right locking pin (39:15 - 39:20)
backs yeah that sounds right what what (39:18 - 39:23)
are our prices here oh boy there's a lot (39:20 - 39:25)
to choose from uh we're not spending (39:23 - 39:27)
$1,000 on a varsity Jack so we got money (39:25 - 39:29)
to burn all right we got money to burn (39:27 - 39:31)

Garchomp Pokemon monthly pin dragon type (40:24 - 40:30)
pin is one of 12 it's (40:27 - 40:34)
$12.99 guard shom pin is about 2 in I'm (40:30 - 40:35)
assuming there's going to be a back (40:34 - 40:37)
scalibur one Greg because there is a (40:35 - 40:39)
back scalibur one in there now but there (40:37 - 40:41)
is going to pay another one here I've (40:39 - 40:43)
now changed my opinion on pins because (40:41 - 40:47)
of one item that I found on (40:43 - 40:50)
Amazon a magnetic pin backs to convert (40:47 - 40:54)
your pins into fridge magnets now I'm (40:50 - 40:58)
back in but you have to break the (40:54 - 41:00)
don't you or do you just stick the pin (40:58 - 41:02)
in the maget stick it in okay you stick (41:00 - 41:04)
it in the magnet Greg are you a magnet (41:02 - 41:06)
person yeah I've been a magnet person (41:04 - 41:08)
for a while I was more of a magnet (41:06 - 41:12)
person when I had a cube you've always (41:08 - 41:14)
been a pin person Greg you just moved (41:12 - 41:17)
from pins to magnets yeah it's the same (41:14 - 41:19)
thing it is not the same thing magnets (41:17 - 41:21)
are vastly (41:19 - 41:24)
different um I'm not wearing magnets on (41:21 - 41:28)
my person I'm putting magnets as decor (41:24 - 41:30)
decor is different than (41:28 - 41:35)
wearable okay I follow but I would get (41:30 - 41:38)
these if I still had an office with a (41:35 - 41:40)
cube that was my own that had the (41:38 - 41:42)
metallic cabinets cuz I would put them (41:40 - 41:45)
on that yeah yeah yeah I don't have that (41:42 - 41:48)
I don't have get that you can you can (41:45 - 41:52)
get a cubicle in your office if you (41:48 - 41:55)
want in my little office I'm going to (41:52 - 41:57)
put a whole cube in there (41:55 - 42:01)
are you mad so I so I have a room that (41:57 - 42:03)
I've decorated myself free from the (42:01 - 42:05)
constraints of corporate Bland and (42:03 - 42:08)
you're like get ugly gray walls and lock (42:05 - 42:09)
yourself back in the prison that you (42:08 - 42:11)
worked in for 20 years you can get you (42:09 - 42:13)
can get one gray wall and put it behind (42:11 - 42:15)
your desk and you can feel that cubicle (42:13 - 42:19)
experience no I'm not going back if I (42:15 - 42:22)
want I will go into my actual office (42:19 - 42:25)
instead of the actual cubes which go you (42:22 - 42:27)
can get the pins and then when you go to (42:25 - 42:29)
your actual office you can push the pins (42:27 - 42:30)
into the (42:29 - 42:33)
felt and or just use the magnets and (42:30 - 42:34)
bring them with you every time yeah (42:33 - 42:36)
that's that's that's the that's the life (42:34 - 42:38)
right there they have a lot of these (42:36 - 42:41)
magnet backers I wonder do which is the (42:38 - 42:45)
best they don't have great (42:41 - 42:45)
ratings so yeah uh if if you want to (42:45 - 42:51)
collect something $12.99 for one pin I (42:48 - 42:53)
think that's a little expensive but it (42:51 - 42:57)
would be glorious if this collection of (42:53 - 42:58)
pins they're doing for the year of the (42:57 - 43:01)
dragon was all pseudo legendaries and (42:58 - 43:02)
Archer (43:01 - 43:06)
Luton oh be so (43:02 - 43:06)
funny they are they are like stained (43:07 - 43:11)
glass though there's a picture of them (43:09 - 43:13)
holding this pin up to the light and it (43:11 - 43:14)
does go through it shines through it (43:13 - 43:18)
it's kind of cool oh um these pins are (43:14 - 43:20)
not that (43:18 - 43:23)
expensive Disney I am on a Disney (43:20 - 43:27)
website right now the D2 3 exclusive (43:23 - 43:29)
Sleeping Beauty 65th anniversary pin (43:27 - 43:31)
limited edition is (43:29 - 43:34)
$299 for a (43:31 - 43:37)
pin the Tiana princess and the frog pin (43:34 - 43:39)
is (43:37 - 43:43)
$4.99 I do know that I should be going (43:39 - 43:46)
to pack in March granted I book The (43:43 - 43:50)
Right Flight and the right date um but (43:46 - 43:52)
uh they do their pin collection they (43:50 - 43:55)
have the packs pins and they they (43:52 - 43:56)
literally said when they started started (43:55 - 43:58)
this like five or six years ago that (43:56 - 43:59)
they were like oh yeah we just we just (43:58 - 44:04)
copied it from Disney um and yeah so but (43:59 - 44:06)
the reason I bring that up is because (44:04 - 44:08)
Pokemon has been going to pretty much (44:06 - 44:10)
every packs and they do the Pokemon lab (44:08 - 44:14)
ex yeah the there it is the penny arcade (44:10 - 44:17)
oh you got an Eevee one for the audio (44:14 - 44:19)
listeners I have the I have the Foy Coco (44:17 - 44:23)
one that I got in Seattle and at one (44:19 - 44:27)
event they did the qule one so I that (44:23 - 44:28)
like that is like the one thing I've (44:27 - 44:31)
legitimately wanted to trade for is like (44:28 - 44:33)
find somebody with a quackle pin and (44:31 - 44:35)
then trade the myoy Coco (44:33 - 44:39)
one but anyways the penny arcade which (44:35 - 44:43)
is the pack stuff is official packs pins (44:39 - 44:45)
or whatever but like companies and (44:43 - 44:47)
Brands will work with packs to get like (44:45 - 44:48)
their official pins so it's really cool (44:47 - 44:50)
that the Pokemon company works with (44:48 - 44:53)
packs to have official Penny arcades (44:50 - 44:55)
because Greg just held up an ev1 I have (44:53 - 44:57)
a Foy Coco one I think they did one (44:55 - 44:59)
before that I know there's a spatio and (44:57 - 45:01)
a quackley one out there but anyways (44:59 - 45:04)
those are free uh if you go to the (45:01 - 45:08)
playlab at Pacs and you just wait in (45:04 - 45:09)
line they teach you how to play the (45:08 - 45:12)
trading card game you get a free 30 card (45:09 - 45:16)
booster like a three a free 30 card deck (45:12 - 45:18)
and then I think you normally get a (45:16 - 45:19)
booster pack I could be wrong in the (45:18 - 45:21)
booster pack and then you get the penny (45:19 - 45:23)
arcade pin you don't get to pick usually (45:21 - 45:25)
each show has one pin they're featuring (45:23 - 45:29)
in Seattle was f f Coco but all you have (45:25 - 45:31)
to do is wait in line I waited in line (45:29 - 45:33)
in Seattle I waited in line for like 10 (45:31 - 45:35)
minutes and then I was against a dude (45:33 - 45:37)
who like never played the TCG and I (45:35 - 45:38)
completely schooled him and then we both (45:37 - 45:40)
got our pins and left and I never talked (45:38 - 45:43)
to him again um but uh they will be at (45:40 - 45:46)
PAX East Pokemon will be at PAX East so (45:43 - 45:49)
if you're going to PAX East I should be (45:46 - 45:51)
going and you should get your free (45:49 - 45:54)
Pokemon pin it's like 15 minutes of your (45:51 - 45:58)
day for a free pin which pretty good (45:54 - 45:58)
do (45:58 - 46:02)
they I they've never run out from my (45:59 - 46:03)
understanding no I've never seen them (46:02 - 46:06)
run out yeah there are some pins that do (46:03 - 46:10)
like run out and and sell out but um I (46:06 - 46:12)
think I think Pokemon probably has the (46:10 - 46:14)
money to just overproduce compared to (46:12 - 46:15)
like the smaller Indie companies that (46:14 - 46:17)
are like ah we could only order a (46:15 - 46:20)
hundred of (46:17 - 46:20)
them but that reminds me of the Disney (46:20 - 46:23)
adults because they do the trading as (46:22 - 46:25)
well the one thing they have over they (46:23 - 46:27)
just doing the trading thing where they (46:25 - 46:28)
hunt people down and have them like (46:27 - 46:30)
that's a whole trading they do it at Gen (46:28 - 46:32)
Con too it's it's the pin thing's a (46:30 - 46:35)
whole lifestyle I think Pokemon goes to (46:32 - 46:37)
Gen Con as well for the same thing the (46:35 - 46:39)
play lab yeah they do I'll probably be (46:37 - 46:41)
there again this year and I will (46:39 - 46:42)
probably go visit (46:41 - 46:44)
them the play (46:42 - 46:47)
lab they did have play Lab at (46:44 - 46:51)
uh go Fest as well which is kind of cool (46:47 - 46:53)
at the Seattle go Fest they had just in (46:51 - 46:57)
the giant cafeteria a convention hall (46:53 - 46:59)
thing they just had the giant play lab (46:57 - 47:01)
where you could I don't think they had (46:59 - 47:04)
pins though I think I think they were (47:01 - 47:05)
giving away like two or three booster (47:04 - 47:09)
packs if you played which is (47:05 - 47:09)
cool (47:09 - 47:16)
um Pokemon Masters (47:12 - 47:16)
ex it's it's it's palentine's day gr it (47:16 - 47:25)
is it's palentine's day (47:22 - 47:28)
everywhere uh they've done two new snc (47:25 - 47:30)
pairs for Valentine's Day one just (47:28 - 47:32)
announced last night so pokemon.com (47:30 - 47:34)
isn't updated with it but the first one (47:32 - 47:37)
here is Victor and (47:34 - 47:41)
greedent Victor who is the protagonist (47:37 - 47:43)
of sword and (47:41 - 47:45)
shield for those that don't know that (47:43 - 47:46)
those characters have name what is it (47:45 - 47:49)
Victor and Gloria I think yeah Victor (47:46 - 47:50)
and (47:49 - 47:54)
Gloria uh normal type sing pair uh with (47:50 - 47:57)
a uh (47:54 - 47:59)
the the the Pekka (47:57 - 48:03)
Berry uh most support sink (47:59 - 48:03)
pairs most support syn pairs in Master's (48:04 - 48:10)
ex use potions to keep their teammates (48:07 - 48:13)
healthy but Victor in greent Forge for (48:10 - 48:15)
an organic approach with a new trainer (48:13 - 48:19)
Type move Citrus Berry this restores an (48:15 - 48:22)
allies HP by approximately 20% and but (48:19 - 48:26)
also has a deep Synergy with Victor (48:22 - 48:30)
Victor's palentine's buddy move and (48:26 - 48:32)
passive skill I don't I don't know what (48:30 - 48:34)
that is well I know what a passive skill (48:32 - 48:37)
is but I oh here it is I found it uh (48:34 - 48:39)
little nibble is what it's (48:37 - 48:44)
called yeah what a good name passive (48:39 - 48:46)
skill helps make their buddy powerful (48:44 - 48:50)
and move available sooner oh so then you (48:46 - 48:52)
can then use the Citrus Berry move again (48:50 - 48:54)
got (48:52 - 48:59)
it got it and then uh they announced (48:54 - 49:00)
last (48:59 - 49:05)
night that Candice and garan darmanitan (49:00 - 49:09)
is the other palen palentine's day (49:05 - 49:11)
pair (49:09 - 49:13)
which I just have the Twitter post I (49:11 - 49:15)
don't is she an attack I'm assuming (49:13 - 49:16)
she's an attacker because darmanitan (49:15 - 49:18)
feels like an (49:16 - 49:21)
attacker um I don't think I think she's (49:18 - 49:23)
Tech actually oh (49:21 - 49:27)
look real quick I can look it up cuz (49:23 - 49:29)
it's in the game right now also that (49:27 - 49:31)
wasn't much of a surprise when they (49:29 - 49:32)
announced Victor and started the (49:31 - 49:34)
storyline suddenly Candace was there (49:32 - 49:35)
with a d manat 10 and you're like huh I (49:34 - 49:38)
wonder who the other one's going to (49:35 - 49:38)
be like come you should just announce (49:39 - 49:43)
him at the same time it's not that big (49:41 - 49:46)
of a secret yeah I will as Greg is (49:43 - 49:49)
looking that up I will say that I love (49:46 - 49:52)
both of their outfits so much outfit are (49:49 - 49:56)
so good Candace is dressed like uh (49:52 - 49:58)
somebody who's like selling you snow (49:56 - 50:01)
cones at like an amusement park it's (49:58 - 50:03)
it's very retro she also has like the (50:01 - 50:06)
high socks with her boots which is like (50:03 - 50:09)
a good touch and then uh (50:06 - 50:14)
Victor his outfit is so good like like (50:09 - 50:15)
he he's legitimately wearing a hoodie (50:14 - 50:18)
that they should be selling the the like (50:15 - 50:20)
little greedent Berry hoodie should be a (50:18 - 50:24)
real product and then his apron is just (50:20 - 50:26)
they're actually giving away his apron (50:24 - 50:28)
social media I think on they're actually (50:26 - 50:30)
making the apron into a real product (50:28 - 50:33)
aren't they yeah the the apron is just a (50:30 - 50:35)
brown apron but then it turns into like (50:33 - 50:39)
a chocolate bar as it goes down the (50:35 - 50:42)
it's it's like such a both outfits are (50:39 - 50:46)
so simple but like fit so well in like (50:42 - 50:48)
the Pokemon world like they just seem (50:46 - 50:50)
like actually genuine clothes that would (50:48 - 50:54)
be Candace is a striker I was thinking (50:50 - 50:58)
Victor the outfits are much more daily (50:54 - 51:02)
wear than they are fancy yeah event (50:58 - 51:05)
outfit but they are event outfits and (51:02 - 51:07)
they're (51:05 - 51:09)
neat I (51:07 - 51:13)
like Victors more than I like (51:09 - 51:13)
Candace's yeah they're both good they're (51:15 - 51:19)
both both they are both (51:17 - 51:23)
good they're just completely different (51:19 - 51:25)
Vibes the the I I don't know if they've (51:23 - 51:27)
done art like this before but the art I (51:25 - 51:29)
posted in the show notes of Candice like (51:27 - 51:32)
I just like this retro background art of (51:29 - 51:33)
like them pointing out (51:32 - 51:36)
her um like here's her hat here's her (51:33 - 51:39)
watch here's like what makes up her (51:36 - 51:40)
outfit yeah they did one of those for (51:39 - 51:43)
Victor too yeah they did oh did they I (51:40 - 51:44)
didn't see that one yeah that must have (51:43 - 51:45)
been a couple days ago when they (51:44 - 51:47)
announced (51:45 - 51:49)
it they're both really they're both (51:47 - 51:51)
really good I don't know if they're I (51:49 - 51:53)
don't know if they're (51:51 - 51:55)
necessarily oh I see it I found the (51:53 - 51:58)
victor one yeah super powerful sink (51:55 - 52:01)
pairs (51:58 - 52:01)
but I think they're both they both look (52:02 - 52:08)
great I don't know that they have a lot (52:06 - 52:13)
of like super great use in game but uh (52:08 - 52:15)
for this event they're good they're (52:13 - 52:17)
they're (52:15 - 52:19)
good yeah who cares about how good they (52:17 - 52:22)
are I just need them to look good yeah I (52:19 - 52:25)
all we do is log in and get the free (52:22 - 52:27)
thing (52:25 - 52:30)
and and try to get the characters we (52:27 - 52:31)
actually want yeah I mean that is that (52:30 - 52:33)
is the most important part for you (52:31 - 52:36)
hardcore people you can you can come in (52:33 - 52:39)
and say they're worth (52:36 - 52:39)
getting they're both great designs I (52:39 - 52:44)
think all of their palentine's designs (52:42 - 52:46)
over the last few years have been really (52:44 - 52:49)
good uh I don't remember what last (52:46 - 52:51)
year's was but I think I I don't think I (52:49 - 52:54)
pulled on them have they done pal (52:51 - 52:56)
palentine's day like here's the previous (52:54 - 52:59)
year's Banner uh that usually comes (52:56 - 53:02)
about a week (52:59 - 53:04)
after (53:02 - 53:07)
uh about we Valentine's Day and before (53:04 - 53:12)
Pokemon day yeah usually after the two (53:07 - 53:14)
new ones come out about a week later (53:12 - 53:16)
they say they run a banner of all the (53:14 - 53:19)
other ones from all the previous years (53:16 - 53:22)
um cuz Lisa was last year with (53:19 - 53:27)
toga oh yeah the other (53:22 - 53:31)
one uh Greg the big question here (53:27 - 53:34)
is for Pokemon day they mow and Appleton (53:31 - 53:35)
that's the one that I have from last (53:34 - 53:38)
year oh the mow uh okay so the question (53:35 - 53:40)
here Greg is they announc a SN pair on (53:38 - 53:42)
Pokemon day every every year last year (53:40 - 53:46)
was May and lattos the year before was (53:42 - 53:48)
Leon and Charizard and year before that (53:46 - 53:51)
was Leon and red sorry not Le red well (53:48 - 53:54)
crazy red and (53:51 - 53:56)
Charizard uh what do you what are they (53:54 - 53:57)
announcing this (53:56 - 54:00)
year so I mean they're leaning heavy (53:57 - 54:02)
into scarlet and (54:00 - 54:07)
violet so I feel like we could get um a (54:02 - 54:09)
grea (54:07 - 54:11)
with what's the (54:09 - 54:14)
flower glamora glamora I feel like (54:11 - 54:16)
that's a strong Contender um because we (54:14 - 54:19)
already have pona right like she's (54:16 - 54:23)
already in the game and so is Penny the (54:19 - 54:24)
other way they could do is round out (54:23 - 54:26)
your friends and go (54:24 - 54:30)
Arvin uh but generally they go with like (54:26 - 54:33)
the champion or a (54:30 - 54:36)
big final person of the (54:33 - 54:39)
series um so I'm I'm I think they could (54:36 - 54:42)
do that they could also just go back and (54:39 - 54:44)
be like it's another it's another red (54:42 - 54:48)
and this time he has I wonder if they do (54:44 - 54:52)
final person of the series it'll be (54:48 - 54:54)
Kieran I wonder if something Dragon (54:52 - 54:58)
related oh but k uran and uh uh the (54:54 - 54:59)
Hydra Hydra (54:58 - 55:02)
Hydra really (54:59 - 55:04)
cool oh also hydrael would probably be (55:02 - 55:07)
one of the monthly Dragon pins yeah (55:04 - 55:08)
hydrael probably be one of the monthly (55:07 - 55:11)
Dragon pins which I actually would kind (55:08 - 55:13)
of want to get that one because I like (55:11 - 55:14)
hydrael a (55:13 - 55:17)
lot Hannah and I had like the same look (55:14 - 55:19)
as we both realized that hydrael is (55:17 - 55:20)
probably going to end up being one of (55:19 - 55:21)
the Dragon (55:20 - 55:23)
pins I'm not convinced there are a lot (55:21 - 55:25)
of appan Evolutions at this Point (55:23 - 55:29)
actually so yeah that's true they just (55:25 - 55:31)
do all of (55:29 - 55:35)
them three of the 12 (55:31 - 55:39)
um yeah what uh they did Latios though (55:35 - 55:42)
it just wasn't Pokemon day Latios came (55:39 - 55:45)
after Latias right yeah it was just may (55:42 - 55:47)
may was first it was Brendan Brendan and (55:45 - 55:52)
L yeah so I we have Chase so I mean (55:47 - 55:54)
they're going all over the place right (55:52 - 55:57)
now (55:54 - 55:57)
um they could also I mean who knows what (55:58 - 56:05)
they're going to do and they they also (56:02 - 56:09)
just pull out weird things like oh hey (56:05 - 56:10)
this is so and so and we're going to (56:09 - 56:14)
give them a mythical so like I'm trying (56:10 - 56:14)
to think of (56:14 - 56:16)
[Music] (56:14 - 56:21)
who is T back (56:16 - 56:23)
Calibur no usually (56:21 - 56:26)
like like we don't have (56:23 - 56:27)
I'm trying to think what mythicals we (56:26 - 56:32)
don't have we don't have a m yet meoa we (56:27 - 56:35)
have meoa came out already oh okay so (56:32 - 56:38)
Meloetta is there we have a Volcanion we (56:35 - 56:42)
don't have who has (56:38 - 56:43)
Volcanion (56:42 - 56:49)
uh Lysander has banon oh okay that makes (56:43 - 56:52)
sense mcar is a mythical right yeah we (56:49 - 56:54)
don't have that because we have Mar (56:52 - 56:56)
Shadow we we don't have (56:54 - 56:59)
MCA do we have (56:56 - 57:01)
zoraa we don't have (56:59 - 57:03)
zeraora but I don't know who that would (57:01 - 57:04)
go with of course I don't know how (57:03 - 57:07)
mcgara would go with either zero would (57:04 - 57:08)
go with (57:07 - 57:13)
vulner sad boy sad boy sad boy to sad (57:08 - 57:16)
sad boy sad cat sad boy sad cat (57:13 - 57:19)
[Music] (57:16 - 57:19)
um (57:20 - 57:23)
they the other thing is we're also (57:23 - 57:28)
getting it's also their anniversary (57:26 - 57:31)
coming up like so I don't know they have (57:28 - 57:34)
a lot to choose from I would I would say (57:31 - 57:36)
they either go one of the mythicals we (57:34 - 57:38)
don't have and is somebody who's already (57:36 - 57:39)
in the (57:38 - 57:44)
game um what generation was Mna (57:39 - 57:49)
from that was sun and moon right yeah so (57:44 - 57:51)
Lily (57:49 - 57:53)
or (57:51 - 57:57)
gladon won't be Lo (57:53 - 57:57)
line one one of those three I don't (57:57 - 58:02)
think it' be (58:00 - 58:02)
Lucine I think Lily makes the more sense (58:03 - 58:08)
for MCA because probably owns one in the (58:06 - 58:11)
anime yeah she has one in the anime (58:08 - 58:14)
fa (58:11 - 58:18)
um yeah that I I feel like either they (58:14 - 58:21)
go champion of scarlet and violet and (58:18 - 58:22)
kind of continue the Scarlet Violet (58:21 - 58:25)
thing they could also be doing a weird (58:22 - 58:28)
thing with Hui since the mystery stones (58:25 - 58:30)
have been leading towards that I don't (58:28 - 58:32)
know when that's going to pay off uh but (58:30 - 58:34)
they've been talking about it so it (58:32 - 58:38)
could be somebody in gutina they put AR (58:34 - 58:41)
arus is in the game yet right not yet no (58:38 - 58:42)
they've hinted towards it but it's not (58:41 - 58:43)
in the game so it could be it could be (58:42 - 58:44)
archus (58:43 - 58:48)
and is it Ry is Ry is Ry the name of the (58:44 - 58:52)
guy in the Hui Ray and what's her name (58:48 - 58:55)
Ray Oh you mean the main character the (58:52 - 58:58)
main characters it's Ray and something (58:55 - 59:01)
old older of time Distortion Brendan and (58:58 - 59:02)
time (59:01 - 59:05)
Distortion not Bron what are their names (59:02 - 59:09)
Ray and aari Ray and aari wait what are (59:05 - 59:12)
the Gen 4 protagonist (59:09 - 59:12)
names Dawn da and Lucas Lucas Lucas (59:12 - 59:19)
Lucas that's that's what it was it's (59:17 - 59:22)
very funny when they meet the when they (59:19 - 59:23)
meet in Pokemon Masters because they're (59:22 - 59:26)
both like what's going on why do you (59:23 - 59:28)
look like me we look alike uh is there (59:26 - 59:30)
any chance they could bring in the (59:28 - 59:33)
characters from the new (59:30 - 59:33)
anime Oh you mean like Leo yeah they the (59:33 - 59:42)
only anime characters they've added are (59:38 - 59:46)
Jesse James and Ash and they've (59:42 - 59:50)
avoided every other one so far they (59:46 - 59:52)
might um I don't think that's very (59:50 - 59:55)
likely uh until that has been more Rel (59:52 - 59:57)
established (59:55 - 60:00)
um plus I don't think they like (59:57 - 60:02)
introducing new voice actors they tend (60:00 - 60:04)
to like if the person's already in the (60:02 - 60:06)
game they don't want to record new voice (60:04 - 60:08)
stuff so generally they'll release (60:06 - 60:12)
somebody who's already in the game um (60:08 - 60:14)
unless they're gon to make a big deal (60:12 - 60:16)
out of (60:14 - 60:16)
it uh speaking of games uh this is our (60:16 - 60:22)
last segment which is the Pokemon sales (60:20 - 60:25)
figures got released which (60:22 - 60:28)
Nintendo releases these numbers because (60:25 - 60:30)
they publish these games and so they (60:28 - 60:32)
also release their Animal Crossing (60:30 - 60:33)
numbers they're Zelda numbers their (60:32 - 60:36)
Mario numbers they do this twice a year (60:33 - 60:39)
uh usually February and then August I (60:36 - 60:42)
think to make their stockholders happy (60:39 - 60:49)
or nervous or whatever not nervous so um (60:42 - 60:50)
there's really no surprises here but (60:49 - 60:53)
we'll just go through it uh still the (60:50 - 60:57)
number one most copies sold of a Pokemon (60:53 - 61:00)
game is red blue and green at 31 million (60:57 - 61:04)
I'm just gonna say I'm not going to read (61:00 - 61:06)
every single number I post the graphic (61:04 - 61:09)
but number one is red blue green all (61:06 - 61:12)
that now I know some people are saying (61:09 - 61:13)
that's unfair because it's three games (61:12 - 61:15)
and everything else is going to be two (61:13 - 61:18)
games uh but blue was never technically (61:15 - 61:21)
released in Japan at a retail level in (61:18 - 61:24)
order to get Pokemon Blue in Japan you (61:21 - 61:26)
had to buy a magazine and then do a mail (61:24 - 61:29)
order for it like you couldn't just walk (61:26 - 61:33)
into a store and buy Pokemon Blue so so (61:29 - 61:36)
they got red and green we got red and (61:33 - 61:38)
blue and then maybe like six people in (61:36 - 61:41)
Japan got Pokemon Blue (61:38 - 61:41)
from (61:42 - 61:45)
Surprise uh the second bestselling (61:45 - 61:49)
Pokemon game of all time is Pokemon (61:47 - 61:52)
sword and shield with 26 million copies (61:49 - 61:54)
and then the number three is Scarlet and (61:52 - 61:57)
violet with 24 million copies so Scarlet (61:54 - 62:00)
Violet is only a little over a year and (61:57 - 62:02)
it is 2 million copies away from sworden (62:00 - 62:04)
Shield which took three years to get (62:02 - 62:06)
there it's two million copies away from (62:04 - 62:08)
being the second best selling Pokemon (62:06 - 62:12)
games which is wild uh it's (62:08 - 62:15)
incredible possible (62:12 - 62:21)
that it beats it um if they do decide to (62:15 - 62:23)
update it anymore whether that's bug (62:21 - 62:26)
fixes or extra (62:23 - 62:29)
content that would alone probably push (62:26 - 62:32)
it over if they decide to do (62:29 - 62:34)
nothing from here on out I still think (62:32 - 62:37)
it probably ends up trickling past sword (62:34 - 62:40)
and shield before the end of its (62:37 - 62:44)
life uh gold and silver is number four (62:40 - 62:47)
at 23 million Diamond and Pearl number (62:44 - 62:51)
five at 17 million x and y number six at (62:47 - 62:53)
16 million then we have sun and moon (62:51 - 62:56)
also 16 million Ruby and Sapphire 16 (62:53 - 63:00)
million and then the out of the nine (62:56 - 63:03)
Generations black and white is the (63:00 - 63:06)
you're the last one there at 15 million (63:03 - 63:09)
I will die on this hill I was alive when (63:06 - 63:10)
it (63:09 - 63:13)
happened black and white got so much (63:10 - 63:16)
more hate than sword and shield did (63:13 - 63:19)
hands down yeah it (63:16 - 63:22)
did and that is one of the reasons why (63:19 - 63:24)
is bottom on this list I know I know (63:22 - 63:25)
Greg and (63:24 - 63:27)
Hannah was also alive I believe I was (63:25 - 63:29)
alive but apparently I wasn't on that (63:27 - 63:31)
part of the internet because everybody I (63:29 - 63:34)
mean I was excited for (63:31 - 63:34)
it for everyone that was so mad at the (63:34 - 63:40)
tree texture of sword and shield there's (63:37 - 63:42)
an equal person that was so mad that (63:40 - 63:45)
they couldn't use Garchomp in black and (63:42 - 63:48)
white also black and white (63:45 - 63:51)
if chugged along (63:48 - 63:55)
too it it was a it was a slow moving (63:51 - 63:59)
game it it was pushing it was pushing (63:55 - 64:01)
things to its limit not as much they (63:59 - 64:02)
fixed it somewhat in black and white too (64:01 - 64:04)
it ran a little bit better but black and (64:02 - 64:06)
white I remember sort of being (64:04 - 64:10)
like okay come on let's go do I have to (64:06 - 64:12)
crank what do what I need to do to make (64:10 - 64:14)
this chug a little bit (64:12 - 64:18)
better uh okay so we'll jump over (64:14 - 64:22)
to the like third versions slash (64:18 - 64:25)
alternate versions SL Ultra whatever you (64:22 - 64:27)
want to call whatever this thing is I (64:25 - 64:29)
will say that black and white even (64:27 - 64:31)
though it is the worst (64:29 - 64:34)
selling look 15 million copies is still (64:31 - 64:38)
incredible it's a lot it's a lot it's (64:34 - 64:41)
still very good for a video game so even (64:38 - 64:42)
though black and white is the worst (64:41 - 64:44)
selling it is still (64:42 - 64:48)
outsold any of these remakes alternate (64:44 - 64:51)
versions enhanced versions so your (64:48 - 64:54)
best-selling remake enhanced version (64:51 - 64:55)
alternative version whatever you want to (64:54 - 64:57)
call it is let's go Pikachu let's go (64:55 - 64:59)
Eevee at 15 (64:57 - 65:03)
million which I love that game uh going (64:59 - 65:05)
to a game I absolutely hate which is (65:03 - 65:07)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl also at (65:05 - 65:11)
15 million and then after that we have (65:07 - 65:14)
Legends archus at 14 million 14.8 (65:11 - 65:17)
million I'm so curious what that number (65:14 - 65:19)
would be if there were two versions of (65:17 - 65:22)
Legends RS me too also it literally if (65:19 - 65:26)
you move that right before Christmas (65:22 - 65:28)
yeah I guarantee you sell like another (65:26 - 65:32)
two to three more million right CU if (65:28 - 65:35)
like if that would have jumped it up (65:32 - 65:37)
into the like if there are two versions (65:35 - 65:42)
of it I feel like it would easily be in (65:37 - 65:42)
the (65:42 - 65:46)
18 at least you think that much oh yeah (65:42 - 65:49)
it was a super popular game yeah I think (65:46 - 65:53)
Christmas matters more than two versions (65:49 - 65:53)
here but I think if it came before (65:53 - 65:58)
Christmas and had two versions then I (65:56 - 66:01)
think it would be up in the (65:58 - 66:01)
20s it's a good game a little short it's (66:01 - 66:07)
very good game uh then you got Pokemon (66:04 - 66:11)
Yellow 14 million uh Omega Ruby Alpha (66:07 - 66:13)
Sapphire also 14 million heart gold soul (66:11 - 66:15)
silver 12 million Fire Red Leaf Green 12 (66:13 - 66:19)
million Ultra Sun Ultra Moon 9 million (66:15 - 66:22)
Black 2 White 2 8 million Platinum 7 (66:19 - 66:25)
million Emerald 7 million Crystal 6 (66:22 - 66:27)
million you could look at this chart and (66:25 - 66:29)
very easily (66:27 - 66:31)
go it makes sense why they don't do (66:29 - 66:34)
third versions (66:31 - 66:34)
anymore like at least Ultra got them an (66:34 - 66:41)
extra two million copies (66:38 - 66:45)
yeah the thing is like what I'm curious (66:41 - 66:47)
about is because I don't know that they (66:45 - 66:49)
say anywhere but (66:47 - 66:53)
do the Virtual Console sales of these (66:49 - 66:58)
count into I glad you asked uh (66:53 - 67:00)
they I did put in the notes to answer (66:58 - 67:04)
question no they don't count okay um but (67:00 - 67:06)
there are there are seven versions of (67:04 - 67:08)
Virtual Console there's red blue green (67:06 - 67:11)
yellow and then there's Gold Silver and (67:08 - 67:13)
Crystal all seven of those games only (67:11 - 67:19)
sold 1.5 million combined oh so even if (67:13 - 67:21)
they did (67:19 - 67:24)
Count none of these numbers shift yeah (67:21 - 67:27)
like no no one like overtakes each other (67:24 - 67:29)
right combined that (67:27 - 67:32)
is such a small fraction of any of the (67:29 - 67:34)
others yeah and this is this is (67:32 - 67:37)
something (67:34 - 67:37)
that has been talked about with like (67:37 - 67:41)
Xbox Live or like (67:39 - 67:44)
PlayStation of like why don't why don't (67:41 - 67:46)
people just throw your old catalog up (67:44 - 67:47)
there why don't why why don't you just (67:46 - 67:49)
put Crash Bandicoot on the PlayStation I (67:47 - 67:50)
actually think crash band that's a bad (67:49 - 67:52)
example I think Crash Bandicoot is up (67:50 - 67:53)
there but you know what I mean just like (67:52 - 67:55)
put all your old games up there it's (67:53 - 67:58)
easy money like people are dying to get (67:55 - 68:01)
them but we know this with like (67:58 - 68:03)
Microsoft talking about it or Sony (68:01 - 68:05)
talking about it it's a lot of people (68:03 - 68:09)
don't go out and seek that old stuff the (68:05 - 68:11)
people online on like Twitter who are (68:09 - 68:14)
very vocal about it they go out and seek (68:11 - 68:16)
it but they're they're not in the (68:14 - 68:18)
minority so it's it's funny when you (68:16 - 68:21)
look at these sales of like seven old (68:18 - 68:25)
games it must just print money like 1.5 (68:21 - 68:28)
million between seven games of like (68:25 - 68:30)
games that you're like oh they just (68:28 - 68:31)
throw them up there they'll just print (68:30 - 68:33)
money that's such a small fra that (68:31 - 68:36)
that's such a small fraction compared to (68:33 - 68:38)
like the work they probably had to put (68:36 - 68:40)
in to like make Pokemon homework and (68:38 - 68:42)
like get the licensing and like they (68:40 - 68:44)
don't get all that money right like (68:42 - 68:46)
Nintendo gets some money game freak gets (68:44 - 68:49)
the other money Pokemon company (68:46 - 68:51)
get one thing I find interesting about (68:49 - 68:54)
the numbers is like so if you take if (68:51 - 68:55)
you you look at because everybody says (68:54 - 68:57)
like oh third third editions don't sell (68:55 - 69:02)
as well if you were to say let's take (68:57 - 69:04)
Ruby and Sapphire which is 16 million (69:02 - 69:07)
copies and you divide those in half for (69:04 - 69:09)
two that's eight million each Emerald (69:07 - 69:12)
comes in at 7 million Emerald comes in (69:09 - 69:14)
as a solid number compared to a single (69:12 - 69:17)
title if you divide that in half like (69:14 - 69:20)
they didn't they sell a little bit worse (69:17 - 69:23)
but comparatively they are doing the (69:20 - 69:26)
same amount of numbers that one version (69:23 - 69:28)
does if you divide it in half roughly (69:26 - 69:30)
when you look at (69:28 - 69:32)
these figures like Crystal sold six (69:30 - 69:34)
million (69:32 - 69:37)
and uh gold and silver sold 23 that's (69:34 - 69:40)
the biggest Gap Platinum sold about 8 (69:37 - 69:43)
million and diamond and pearl sold 17 so (69:40 - 69:46)
they are they are very close as a third (69:43 - 69:49)
tier product if you divided those in (69:46 - 69:51)
half I don't think they sell as terrible (69:49 - 69:52)
as (69:51 - 69:53)
everybody makes them up because you're (69:52 - 69:57)
comparing ing one title to (69:53 - 69:59)
two but when you're thinking about that (69:57 - 70:01)
actually in practice not everybody buys (69:59 - 70:04)
both games (70:01 - 70:06)
right so like it's interesting to look (70:04 - 70:10)
at so what if you so the weird thing is (70:06 - 70:12)
after the pattern had been established (70:10 - 70:15)
with yellow and then it was redone in (70:12 - 70:16)
Crystal the thing that I'm always (70:15 - 70:18)
curious about as they break down the (70:16 - 70:20)
consumers how many people were waiting (70:18 - 70:23)
for the third version to buy it is there (70:20 - 70:25)
how many people bought all three how (70:23 - 70:27)
many people just bought one and then (70:25 - 70:29)
bought the other like there's a lot (70:27 - 70:32)
that's not in just pure sales numbers to (70:29 - 70:33)
say like this is why they don't make (70:32 - 70:35)
those anymore because if you divide them (70:33 - 70:38)
up they're like they sell and obviously (70:35 - 70:39)
they sell well enough that they (70:38 - 70:41)
continued making the pattern like there (70:39 - 70:43)
was a big investment that they were (70:41 - 70:44)
getting back on these but I don't think (70:43 - 70:47)
the numbers are as wildly variable for a (70:44 - 70:51)
third version as as people necessarily (70:47 - 70:53)
point out and say this is 100% why they (70:51 - 70:55)
don't make these anymore I think it's (70:53 - 70:59)
easier to do DLC now uh than to go back (70:55 - 71:03)
and fix it split black and white and sun (70:59 - 71:06)
and moon in half black two white two and (71:03 - 71:09)
Ultra Sun Ultra Moon out sells that yeah (71:06 - 71:11)
100% so I I I think them doing two (71:09 - 71:14)
versions is still beneficial that's why (71:11 - 71:16)
still to this day it is crazy to me that (71:14 - 71:18)
there's only one version of (71:16 - 71:22)
Legends that it is it is it is the one (71:18 - 71:24)
thing it's like you I don't know the (71:22 - 71:26)
thought process was there but other than (71:24 - 71:28)
I think you literally have two clans in (71:26 - 71:30)
the game you just have a pearl version (71:28 - 71:33)
and a diamond version I mean they really (71:30 - 71:35)
leaned away from having to trade in that (71:33 - 71:38)
one too like you could get everything (71:35 - 71:39)
and so having two versions would be (71:38 - 71:41)
leaning back into the trade and I don't (71:39 - 71:43)
know that they want I I get but that's (71:41 - 71:45)
the one multiplayer aspect of that game (71:43 - 71:48)
is trading yeah I mean I get somewhat (71:45 - 71:50)
the thought process I don't think it was (71:48 - 71:53)
a good thought process coest training (71:50 - 71:56)
animation of the whole series have you (71:53 - 71:59)
traded a Pokemon in that game it's so (71:56 - 72:01)
cool it's so cool it is very cool like (71:59 - 72:03)
literally no one has done it because (72:01 - 72:05)
they're just like I'm just going to use (72:03 - 72:07)
the Link cable item which is great like (72:05 - 72:09)
I'm not complaining they should get rid (72:07 - 72:11)
of that it's a good item (72:09 - 72:14)
uh I think you know you you there is (72:11 - 72:18)
such a huge drop between yellow and (72:14 - 72:22)
Crystal yellow yellow was different (72:18 - 72:25)
enough to be like this is more like the (72:22 - 72:28)
Anime Pikachu is following you he has (72:25 - 72:30)
little emotions and then so I think I (72:28 - 72:32)
think it had to do with how they (72:30 - 72:34)
marketed it and plus obviously it was at (72:32 - 72:36)
the peak of Pokemon (72:34 - 72:38)
fever (72:36 - 72:41)
Crystal I remember the crystal launch (72:38 - 72:43)
because Crystal was (72:41 - 72:45)
like I felt like no one was playing (72:43 - 72:47)
Pokemon anymore like that's where the (72:45 - 72:50)
drop off started happening leading into (72:47 - 72:53)
Generation 3 uh where like that audience (72:50 - 72:55)
was getting getting older cuz I was that (72:53 - 72:56)
audience right I was like 10 years old (72:55 - 72:58)
when red and blue came out and so when (72:56 - 73:00)
Crystal was coming out it was like what (72:58 - 73:02)
eth or nth grade and like Pokemon wasn't (73:00 - 73:07)
cool and people have moved on um obv (73:02 - 73:08)
like (73:07 - 73:09)
[Music] (73:08 - 73:15)
90 2000 2001 for Crystal 2001 in in (73:09 - 73:18)
North America yeah yeah Crystal was one (73:15 - 73:20)
of my first games but I don't think it (73:18 - 73:23)
was my first game I think that I got it (73:20 - 73:24)
as a hand me- down (73:23 - 73:26)
from someone so I wasn't (73:24 - 73:31)
really around for the launch I was very (73:26 - 73:34)
small I mean they (73:31 - 73:34)
they when you look at just remakes you (73:34 - 73:42)
got you got Fire Red heartold Omega Ruby (73:38 - 73:45)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl and then (73:42 - 73:46)
P (73:45 - 73:49)
um and the one that stands out like just (73:46 - 73:52)
like yellow is like they did something (73:49 - 73:55)
super like way different with let's go (73:52 - 73:56)
Pikachu let's go (73:55 - 74:00)
Eevee so and again I think that has the (73:56 - 74:02)
height yeah that was at the height of (74:00 - 74:04)
Pokemon go of Pokemon go it's also all (74:02 - 74:07)
gen one again we know gen one (74:04 - 74:10)
sells it was based off of yellow they (74:07 - 74:12)
gave it a special Pokeball like I think (74:10 - 74:14)
I think they marketed that super well (74:12 - 74:17)
they did they did I mean it's also it (74:14 - 74:19)
helps that let's go Pikachu let's go (74:17 - 74:23)
Eevee was based off of yellow like it it (74:19 - 74:25)
there other bestselling one like it (74:23 - 74:29)
wasn't a pure it wasn't a pure remake of (74:25 - 74:32)
of red and blue it was you know a good (74:29 - 74:33)
remake of (74:32 - 74:35)
yellow they marketed it well they tied (74:33 - 74:37)
it in to go well they cap they hit it at (74:35 - 74:40)
the right time at the height of you know (74:37 - 74:42)
at the height or beginning decline of (74:40 - 74:44)
Go's (74:42 - 74:46)
popularity it was one of the first ones (74:44 - 74:47)
on the switch wasn't (74:46 - 74:51)
it yeah it was the first switch po so (74:47 - 74:52)
like they hit it when the switch was new (74:51 - 74:55)
it was the first you know new Switch (74:52 - 74:57)
like it it all came together at the (74:55 - 74:59)
right time it's like when all the (74:57 - 75:02)
engines hit at the right moment and you (74:59 - 75:04)
can tell in the sales (75:02 - 75:08)
yeah um going back to the like 1.5 (75:04 - 75:11)
million copies that the seven virtual (75:08 - 75:14)
consoles sold if you looked at the 3DS (75:11 - 75:17)
eShop Pokemon games were like top of the (75:14 - 75:22)
leaderboard mhm so imagine the other (75:17 - 75:25)
games in the shop like if Pokemon was (75:22 - 75:28)
struggling to sell this much as a (75:25 - 75:29)
virtual (75:28 - 75:33)
game imagine the imagine the other games (75:29 - 75:34)
because the thing that Pokemon has going (75:33 - 75:37)
on is it's constantly being talked about (75:34 - 75:39)
there's always Pokemon news every week (75:37 - 75:41)
it's why I'm able to do (75:39 - 75:44)
this one the biggest franch in the world (75:41 - 75:48)
yeah yeah so like if that's your (75:44 - 75:50)
best-selling eShop game and it took (75:48 - 75:52)
seven copies just to break a (75:50 - 75:55)
million digital sales that doesn't look (75:52 - 75:59)
very good for other things in the eShop (75:55 - 76:01)
again they had to do a lot they had to (75:59 - 76:03)
do a lot of work to make that bank (76:01 - 76:05)
compatible too didn't they oh I'm I'm (76:03 - 76:08)
sure like I'm I'm sure making bank work (76:05 - 76:10)
was a million dooll investment oh AB (76:08 - 76:11)
yeah I'm (76:10 - 76:13)
sure and somebody's gonna know (76:11 - 76:14)
somebody's I know right now comment on (76:13 - 76:17)
YouTube whether you bought comment on (76:14 - 76:19)
YouTube your favorite game I know (76:17 - 76:21)
somebody's going to comment (76:19 - 76:25)
like no I could program that a day but (76:21 - 76:28)
like the sure I'm sure you could but (76:25 - 76:30)
like if you work if you work at a (76:28 - 76:31)
corporate job 9 to-5 your biggest (76:30 - 76:34)
expense is the salary you are (76:31 - 76:38)
paying your your workers and if you if (76:34 - 76:41)
you put a team of what like five people (76:38 - 76:44)
on that and each person is getting (76:41 - 76:47)
paid what what a program are getting (76:44 - 76:51)
paid like 120,000 in Japan (76:47 - 76:54)
um programmers in America are like 120 (76:51 - 76:57)
yeah (76:54 - 76:57)
a let's look it up video game programmer (77:01 - 77:05)
salary uh well I mean there there are a (77:06 - 77:13)
lot of lay this year (77:09 - 77:15)
woof this is a (77:13 - 77:19)
range uh the midpoint is (77:15 - 77:21)
100k (77:19 - 77:24)
okay well it has to be hire at game (77:21 - 77:27)
freak because no one leaves that job (77:24 - 77:30)
you're there forever but I mean this is (77:27 - 77:34)
America let's let let's be real America (77:30 - 77:37)
does stuff very (77:34 - 77:40)
different so this is America Japan has (77:37 - 77:42)
different different things they probably (77:40 - 77:44)
do pay a little bit more but they also (77:42 - 77:45)
treat their people perhaps a little bit (77:44 - 77:48)
better you're also require to go to the (77:45 - 77:51)
bar with your co-workers after you're (77:48 - 77:54)
done with your shift (77:51 - 77:56)
hit that karaoke when you're done even (77:54 - 77:58)
so even like 100,000 five people that's (77:56 - 78:01)
half a million on that project minus (77:58 - 78:02)
they're getting pulled from a different (78:01 - 78:04)
project so you have to you have to put (78:02 - 78:06)
people there minus the server costs and (78:04 - 78:08)
everything else maintenance (78:06 - 78:13)
security like there's no way they they (78:08 - 78:13)
made I like in my head there's no way (78:13 - 78:17)
that Pokemon Bank actually makes them (78:15 - 78:20)
money after everything's said and (78:17 - 78:20)
done (78:22 - 78:27)
Pokemon Bank just on its own yeah just (78:25 - 78:30)
as like a like like even though you (78:27 - 78:33)
could subscribe to it for $5 a (78:30 - 78:36)
year like I think after what almost 10 (78:33 - 78:37)
years of Pokemon Bank (78:36 - 78:41)
existing I bet that is a net negative (78:37 - 78:42)
for (78:41 - 78:46)
them depending on how much they count (78:42 - 78:47)
towards it so when you're when you're (78:46 - 78:50)
thinking of it like that probably yes (78:47 - 78:52)
but also I know that it's made a whole (78:50 - 78:54)
bunch of people stick with Pokemon and (78:52 - 78:56)
continue getting the newer games I think (78:54 - 78:57)
MoneyWise net (78:56 - 79:01)
negative customer (78:57 - 79:04)
intention positive oh the game (79:01 - 79:07)
programmer salary in Japan is terrible (79:04 - 79:11)
yeah that's what I expected oh it's (79:07 - 79:15)
terrible the midpoint is 7 million yen (79:11 - 79:17)
which is (79:15 - 79:22)
46,000 a year in American that is awful (79:17 - 79:25)
the highend says it's 19 what is 19 (79:22 - 79:28)
million so the high end is (79:25 - 79:33)
127 uh thousand but yeah it's it is (79:28 - 79:36)
worse (79:33 - 79:40)
o but you know since you're doing you (79:36 - 79:42)
are you're really working yes you are (79:40 - 79:44)
yes you (79:42 - 79:47)
are um I don't know I mean par parari (79:44 - 79:49)
sweat in Japan is only like 120 yen I (79:47 - 79:52)
went to the Asian mall and it was $3 (79:49 - 79:55)
that was like three times the price (79:52 - 79:58)
like that's because you're paying import (79:55 - 80:00)
fees yeah food and no I found parari (79:58 - 80:02)
sweat on Amazon I've I've made the (80:00 - 80:05)
switch now (80:02 - 80:05)
uh food in Japan is a lot cheaper than (80:06 - 80:11)
it is in the in the United States I was (80:08 - 80:15)
there for what three weeks and I I every (80:11 - 80:17)
time I ate out I was just blown away I (80:15 - 80:19)
was like there there must be a typo (80:17 - 80:22)
there like it's this cheap like the (80:19 - 80:24)
first place I ate when we got to (80:22 - 80:27)
Japan uh was the the like fast food (80:24 - 80:29)
curry place I can't remember what it's (80:27 - 80:32)
called something Curry um Coco Curry (80:29 - 80:35)
Coco Curry I think oh yeah that's it uh (80:32 - 80:38)
went to CoCo Curry and it w it ended up (80:35 - 80:41)
being $18 for two people that's like two (80:38 - 80:45)
full meals drinks I think one appetizer (80:41 - 80:47)
and I was like this this can't be right (80:45 - 80:50)
$18 and I don't have to T if I went to (80:47 - 80:54)
Panera it would be $18 for one person (80:50 - 80:55)
and I would have the world's smallest (80:54 - 80:58)
sandwich because Panera sandwiches get (80:55 - 81:01)
smaller every single year and their (80:58 - 81:03)
price (81:01 - 81:03)
go that meal slap though Coco Curry was (81:04 - 81:09)
awesome that was (81:09 - 81:17)
good um anyways with the Pokemon sales (81:13 - 81:20)
figures it it I would be curious to see (81:17 - 81:23)
because you know everyone speculates and (81:20 - 81:25)
I'll use the word speculate very hard (81:23 - 81:28)
that generation 10 would probably arrive (81:25 - 81:31)
around Pokemon's 30th Anniversary which (81:28 - 81:37)
would be um 2026 yep and I think it's (81:31 - 81:40)
safe to say between now and 20126 there (81:37 - 81:42)
should be a new version of a Nintendo (81:40 - 81:44)
switch I think within the next two years (81:42 - 81:47)
there should be a new version so the (81:44 - 81:52)
question is in order to out sell scarlet (81:47 - 81:54)
and violet and sword and shield (81:52 - 81:57)
if they make a switch to (81:54 - 81:59)
version I'll just say switch to I have (81:57 - 82:00)
no clue what it's going to be called (81:59 - 82:03)
right like whatever um switch 2 is a (82:00 - 82:05)
safe bet with their naming conventions (82:03 - 82:08)
yeah if they make a switch 2 only (82:05 - 82:11)
version of a generation 10 the problem (82:08 - 82:13)
they run into is the install base of (82:11 - 82:16)
owning that console they are limited by (82:13 - 82:18)
the amount of people who (82:16 - 82:22)
own a new Switch so do they (82:18 - 82:27)
do do they make a generation 10 for both (82:22 - 82:31)
switch 2 and switch to then hit as many (82:27 - 82:32)
of the wild there yeah like breath of (82:31 - 82:34)
the wild yeah exactly like breath of the (82:32 - 82:36)
wild or like um Twilight Princess was (82:34 - 82:40)
the same way it was on both GameCube and (82:36 - 82:42)
the Wii Wii (82:40 - 82:44)
U because I think that's the that's the (82:42 - 82:48)
problem right now is like yeah you like (82:44 - 82:50)
Nintendo's problem is they couldn't get (82:48 - 82:55)
enough switches out there fast enough (82:50 - 82:55)
and there's a lot of switches out there (82:56 - 83:00)
right now there's what like 130 million (82:57 - 83:02)
switches out (83:00 - 83:04)
there I mean I would imagine given their (83:02 - 83:06)
past history it is very likely they'll (83:04 - 83:08)
make a game for both (83:06 - 83:12)
right like that works on both well they (83:08 - 83:16)
Pokemon hasn't done that before no but I (83:12 - 83:19)
mean given Nintendo's history like they (83:16 - 83:22)
tend to ask that of their developers um (83:19 - 83:24)
I wouldn't be surprised if they wouldn't (83:22 - 83:26)
do it for this one it really depends on (83:24 - 83:29)
when the next generation of the switch (83:26 - 83:33)
hits uh if this year if it's this year (83:29 - 83:35)
then they may say no only do it for (83:33 - 83:37)
switch 2 if it's next year then I think (83:35 - 83:39)
they're like no you're gonna have to (83:37 - 83:41)
figure out a way to make it work in both (83:39 - 83:43)
right but the the worry is (83:41 - 83:45)
like if they have to make it work for (83:43 - 83:47)
both scarlet and violet ain't running (83:45 - 83:50)
too hot on are they going to be able to (83:47 - 83:51)
make those performance enhancements (83:50 - 83:54)
they've said mm H the other the other (83:51 - 83:57)
rumor which I'm always curious about is (83:54 - 84:00)
that they said (83:57 - 84:00)
that it would be backwards compatible (84:00 - 84:05)
who knows because there's a lot of (84:03 - 84:07)
Nintendo consoles that are not backwards (84:05 - 84:09)
compatible but if it is backwards and (84:07 - 84:12)
compatible would Pokemon release a (84:09 - 84:16)
patch like how Ultra Sun Ultra Moon runs (84:12 - 84:21)
better on a new 3DS I mean I we had that (84:16 - 84:23)
somewhat with the 3DS in the DS right (84:21 - 84:26)
like yeah yeah we did yes like they have (84:23 - 84:28)
sort of done that in the past like the (84:26 - 84:31)
3DS played all the DS games but not (84:28 - 84:34)
particularly well right yeah there was (84:31 - 84:36)
it was like there was some chunking (84:34 - 84:37)
there were some issues with how it fit (84:36 - 84:41)
in there yeah it worked yeah that's you (84:37 - 84:43)
could say that it definitely worked we (84:41 - 84:44)
can say that about scarlet and violet it (84:43 - 84:50)
works it works I fate prays but it works (84:44 - 84:55)
um I think it all it all comes down (84:50 - 84:59)
to a few things I if H if they have (84:55 - 85:02)
already given Game (84:59 - 85:05)
Freak the switch to right like even if (85:02 - 85:07)
it's coming out in 2025 it chances are (85:05 - 85:09)
that they already have prototypes done (85:07 - 85:11)
so they may say here it is make it work (85:09 - 85:14)
for this and we're going to sell more (85:11 - 85:18)
switch twos by making this an exclusive (85:14 - 85:19)
so people will want to switch over (85:18 - 85:21)
because scarlet and violet so well blah (85:19 - 85:23)
blah blah it's a flagship (85:21 - 85:26)
product y y y sure sure Pokemon does (85:23 - 85:28)
sell consoles for sure so chance I mean (85:26 - 85:30)
there's a number of ways they could go (85:28 - 85:32)
depending I think it all depends on (85:30 - 85:33)
where they are in development of the (85:32 - 85:36)
switch to or whatever it's going to be (85:33 - 85:40)
called um if it's already mostly done (85:36 - 85:42)
then I have I would strongly say that (85:40 - 85:45)
for the 10th anniversary it's a switch (85:42 - 85:46)
to exclusive and they're going to push (85:45 - 85:48)
it to sell (85:46 - 85:48)
consoles I say (85:51 - 85:56)
if it's not done like if it's not done (85:53 - 85:57)
until 2025 then they're not going to (85:56 - 86:01)
hold back the 10th anniversary anything (85:57 - 86:02)
and they're gonna figure out how to make (86:01 - 86:04)
it compatible on (86:02 - 86:06)
both yeah I mean I if there's any if (86:04 - 86:10)
there's any developer that probably (86:06 - 86:13)
knows or has access to new hardware from (86:10 - 86:16)
Nintendo it's probably game freak (86:13 - 86:18)
obviously it's like Nintendo themselves (86:16 - 86:19)
because they develop and publish their (86:18 - 86:23)
own games but like (86:19 - 86:24)
you when you think of like companies (86:23 - 86:28)
that hold Secrets pretty well like game (86:24 - 86:31)
freak's pretty up there yeah like no one (86:28 - 86:33)
saw Legends coming no one saw let's go (86:31 - 86:36)
Pikachu let's go Eevee coming right like (86:33 - 86:38)
how many people thought Pokemon stars (86:36 - 86:41)
including us on this podcast was coming (86:38 - 86:42)
and then it ended up being Ultra Sun (86:41 - 86:45)
Ultra moon (86:42 - 86:47)
like there they they're pretty good with (86:45 - 86:48)
that at (86:47 - 86:54)
least so if I think yeah I I think we (86:48 - 86:57)
got plenty of time to talk about gen 10 (86:54 - 87:00)
and possible new hardware and all that (86:57 - 87:05)
stuff um next week's episode is uh our (87:00 - 87:08)
wants our predictions are what is (87:05 - 87:11)
probably a given for Pokemon day um so (87:08 - 87:14)
no not a typical episode so if there is (87:11 - 87:17)
breaking news this week uh you'll have (87:14 - 87:18)
to wait we'll have one more episode (87:17 - 87:22)
before Pokemon day so we'll have last (87:18 - 87:23)
minut (87:22 - 87:25)

actually you gotta find me though I'm (87:43 - 87:50)
moving I should be in the park on (87:46 - 87:52)
Saturday although I think I have like (87:50 - 87:53)
some night antic ticket so I think I'm (87:52 - 87:55)
technically allowed in the park on (87:53 - 87:57)
Saturday and Sunday where most people (87:55 - 88:00)
only have one um Niantic did not pay for (87:57 - 88:02)
my hotel they did not pay for my flight (88:00 - 88:04)
they've only given me a ticket to the (88:02 - 88:06)
event so just there's your disclosure I (88:04 - 88:09)

in the slack though at least that I see (88:36 - 88:40)
there's always something going wrong (88:38 - 88:43)
there's always the slack a lot (88:40 - 88:45)
smaller yeah the slack is smaller it's (88:43 - 88:47)
like 800 people versus the Discord is I (88:45 - 88:50)
