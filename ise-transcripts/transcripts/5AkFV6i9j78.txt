[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 474 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello hello i am here uh i was going to play pokemon go with my pokeball plus while we were recording alas my pokeball plus is out of battery yeah i thought about too i was cuz i had it i'm like i got it here i got right here i'm gonna connect it and it's like no i don't light up anymore because you have to charge me so it's charging in the bathroom oh okay uh will's there well is got his pokeball plus going catching shinies as we go zip tie well that's how you like pokeball plus yes oh gosh sounds like tick tock everything on ticket talks a life hack life hacks you put the roll of toilet paper on the thing that's not a life hack that's how you do it why was the lady submerging after she put her foundation on she submerged her face in cold water and she's like look my makeup looks absolutely perfect 16 hours later and i'm like why would you want your makeup stop wearing makeup how about that did i ever tell you about the time that i saw this video that said you're tying your shoes wrong and so i went to it thinking oh i'm tying my shoes wrong except though they only showed the right way which is the way i tie my shoes and since then i have been confused that there is another way to tie shoes out there that i've never run into what do you make the two loops and then wrap the loops around each other no how do you do it do you do bunny ears yeah that's what i'm saying you make two loops and then wrap the loops around each other if that's bunny ears because i like to try to make the faster way yeah look i have to show you i'll have to show you something anyways it's hard to explain when i watched this video the video showed me the way that i tie my shoes which means there is another way out there that i have never run into and i know nobody who ties their shoes i know that there are two ways to tie your shoes one is the over under and then like kind of wrap it around your finger that way and then there's another way where you you make two loops and then you wrap the loops around each other and around each other and you're done and that's supposed to be there's a third way faster than that there are too many you know the fastest way is like what you millennials gen zers or whatever are doing where you don't ever untie your shoes and you just leave them loose velcro okay get the shoehorn shoehorn yeah then you don't have to worry about the heel being flat when you put your sometimes i feel like it this is the premium ise content we'll record videos of the three of us tying shoes hide behind a paywall it'll be great yeah everybody's in for shoe ties uh let's talk about the pokemon news is this they're always never not pokemon news and so we haven't yet pulled the article that you're saving in your back pocket from 1999. we don't need the backup articles yet we're going to start off with a tweet though it says attention trainers tune into our youtube channel on wednesday august 18th 2021 at 6 00 am p d t that's 8 am central time for people who live in the good area of the united states uh for a pokemon presents video presenting uh pokemon diamond brilliant diamond and there's a lot of the hashtag pokemon brilliant diet diamond pokemon shining pearl and pokemon legends arceus uh and it's supposed to be 23 minutes long which is the last 28 minutes long i thought it was 23. i have no clue i think it's 23. uh i could be wrong though it's 20 something it's regardless it's the longest pokemon presents not technically a pokemon direct i don't think they use the word pokemon direct anymore but i also don't think it matters uh so yeah they finally are gonna give us something to talk about finally well wait that's being presumptuous they may give us information they may give us that worth talking about they may give us absolutely nothing uh greg's right it's 28 minutes so ha ha so on june 17th 2020 which is what was that the day before the day no that was the day of isle of armor that was the 10 minute and 50 second presentation which i believe showed isle of armor and i think pokemon smile yes and i feel like there was one more thing and then the following week because they were like come back for new information for a new thing and everyone thought it was let's go johto because there was espeon plush behind the dude i don't know it was a bit of a stretch there's a there's an old nine tails plush behind me so that should be your first clue that something special is happening the old sun and moon remakes coming yeah and awesome special thing up here and uh knock off ducklit so june 24th which was the following week was 11 minutes long uh that was the first time we saw a pokemon unite and then february 26 which is earlier this year of course that was a 20 minute and 26 second presentation and that was the music announcement right and the trailers originally and then the remember our history kind of thing and i don't know how they wasted 20 minutes but they did i mean 20 minutes goes fast when you have nothing to talk about as proven it's very true you look at the show the show is proof how fast time flies um but yeah prior to that they were saying pokemon direct pokemon direct pokemon direct and then i guess june 17th they call it pokemon presents and they've been using that since so they just don't want crossover brand confusion with nintendo directs yeah that's probably the alliteration really the pokemon presents pokemon presents pokemon pokemon so that's exciting uh i don't i mean we could sit here and speculate and waste time but literally there has been nothing shown been nothing so it's gonna show us something nothing we could say today would be any different than what we've been saying so we'll just expect a long episode next week or not i mean it depends on how much they waste in these 28 minutes uh well i'm sure they'll show the games finally and two 10-minute trailers and eight minutes of interstitial chatting the one thing i will say is i'm very curious if they will use the words open world for arceus because they have not used those words at all ooh make a bingo card and put it on instagram yeah because even though i and probably obviously the rest of the world can look at that game and go oh that looks open world they did not ever say that in any press release or any uh information dump or any linkedin post linkedin post do you think they're hiding details on linkedin is that the secret to the 25th anniversary it's all been on linkedin they actually called me up and they're like will how do you make your pokemons of the weeks so like intriguing and and and deep and like so mysterious and i was like well you can sometimes you gotta sprinkle it where people don't expect it right linkedin try one on linkedin and see what you get go back go back to live journal there's a whole thing on live journal i'm sure you know i'm sure there is uh you know we haven't talked about community day on the show in probably over a year because comedian day is the same yep but my community was interesting i'd be curious if your guys's day was interesting and the reason that we're going to spend the next couple minutes here talking about community is because one it was a repeat and two this was the first community day where uh well i shouldn't say the first community where there's been pokemon go drama but we talked about it last week people were very upset about the distance uh and boy did i feel it on community day yeah i feel like it wasn't that big of a deal going out and playing for like 10 minutes the day they changed it but when you're outside for like five six hours you're like man this this is terrible this is this is not fun it reminds me of only only destiny players will know this it reminds me of like i was a huge i put 1 200 hours into like the hunter class in destiny well well maybe knows what i'm talking about and then in destiny 2 they changed just a couple things about it and i hated it and it was just like two or three very minor changes and i was like these are all awful yeah i don't know anymore they did that to classes in mmos a lot where they're like we're doing this and then you play you're like no i don't this is bad i don't like this um but the thing that like shocked me is for a community is i went to uh elm grove village park one of the best places to play in in milwaukee and i have gone there probably 20 plus times how many communities have there been like 40 at this point well it's per month so there's something but it started late four years one per month 12 yeah like four or three years uh well okay we'll say between 36 and 48 sure yeah somewhere in there um and i arrived at noon i was an hour late same i parked it was a gorgeous day out it was about 75. it was really nice park wasn't didn't look too busy i parked i got out of the car loaded up go evolve my mega pidgeot to get that normal boost oh why didn't you give me that sick tip i should i don't think i have one i mean i have one i didn't do it and there are probably 30 to 40 pokestops at this park and only two of them were lured up and we're an hour into the event now i know what you're saying steve it was a repeat community we've had repeat communities before but the thing that i was always stuck stood out in my mind i can't remember which community it was but i went to it was it was in the middle of winter it was like 28 degrees fahrenheit snow everywhere the walkways were icy there were people out there with shorts cheese hats whatever else people do in wisconsin every stop was lured up like wisconsin people the the cold is not going to stop yeah the cold doesn't stop much if it's a good community the snow it could be raining all these stuff it was the first time ever i was like oh no one's doing this community now ever since they've done six hour commute days i've seen it where you know the first three hours are pretty bustling the last three hours or not which is understandable you can only do so much and it's the same thing for six hours i get it you know you get your three shinies you baby play for two three maybe four hours you go home you get a sandwich but no one was playing so i'm curious it was it it felt weird but also like oh maybe the people are putting their money where their mouth is and they're like i don't want to buy lures i don't want to buy incubators i don't want to buy lure incense i'm not going to play the game because i'm mad about this change or maybe i don't know wisconsin just doesn't like evie uh but i don't know how you're as a comedian it was uh you went to the art party yeah we went to we went to the air park like we always do uh it was quieter than normal yes agreed uh there were because normally like you were there for you were there for a go fest so that's when it was his busiest and usually it's about half that many people in a regular community today and i would say there was maybe a fourth of that when we were there yesterday like our group of six was the biggest group i saw other than a family that had way too many kids yeah uh but usually right now some of those kids look adopted so yeah well who knows they still had way too many kids they're like 400 kids and usually every other stop i would say is has some sort of lure on it and there were only three up near this community center and one down at the bottom of the path and the rest was empty other than the few that i put up we didn't run into anybody who was really playing like we'd usually walk past people who were on their phone playing and that really didn't happen it was a very quiet day um so i i would say that attendance was down because we got there at noon but i i would just also say overall the park was emptier than usual yeah the park was really like over by the i want to call it the flaming canoe but that doesn't sound right i mean it's a canoe fire pit so normally like there's families having picnics there and there was nobody there was nobody there but also they were setting up for a wedding and i wonder because you could see that when you were driving in i wonder if people saw the setup for the wedding and was like and we're like oh i don't want to be around here when the wedding's happening so left but i've been there when they've been sending it for weddings before and that hasn't happened it could have driven some people away but i mean it was on a saturday which is usually more busy than sunday yeah so the other thing i might say is there there weren't any good raids no it's like one of the draws of coming out to a community [Laughter] no no i mean when we did a raid it was a shellows and i had just hatched one in the morning and i was like why am i wasting my raid pass on this slimy slug because we got it right back afterwards we had to complete a raid for a quest also greg didn't buy the community day special research i don't know why 99 cents shouting that out calling him out on that okay both of you and alex were like i'll give you the 99 cents and i'm like i just don't want to deal with the special research today i don't want to do it i don't care i don't want more evs i'm a happy way i am is that a money thing i have the money i just didn't want to do it and that's also a big criteria too because like i was looking at it i was like the last time we had the two-day eb day i got like 17 shiny eevees how many more shiny evs do i need but what everybody who didn't show up did miss were some really good hamburgers oh yeah good hamburger yeah we did i like that place it's very yummy we had a very good lunch i full disclosure niantic did pay for my 99 ticket so give that to me i do i you you i i used it i did it you're more likely to pay money yeah research work blah blah uh you know i don't i would do it for free if somebody forced it if somebody forced it upon me and said oh we bought you this ticket and here it is i would do it but i was gonna make a point of it i don't know if i would have bought it i kind of forgot and then like i was like oh i have this ticket in my inventory thanks niantic um i didn't expect to play as long as i played i ended up playing for four hours which is way too long for a repeat community but i was my community is when it because i i don't play with anyone here in wisconsin is pretty much calling my dad or somebody else and then like being on the phone and then not paying attention to the game and then just like walking and talking i like to walk and talk or listen to like an audiobook i got some audiobook done so when i when i ended community and i was like wow cool i walked like 10 miles oh and i caught like 20 shinies like why what am i gonna do with this but the weather was super nice like it was it was a gorgeous day that's why i was so shocked that the park was like empty but again i mean if this has to do with people i look i'm guilty of it i love this game it's very hard for me to stop playing i get it people are mad people don't want to play people don't want to give money i totally understand i'm on your side i have a problem i like this video game uh and so for me like walking 10 miles was like it felt good physically and mentally to you know get out there i i will say of some value to both greg and i are that we both me sooner than greg uh got the research tasks to get to level 42 which means you have to evolve every form of eevee again yes folks again again it doesn't count whatever the uh sylveon bonus made that much much easier because starting the day on saturday i had uh i think it was like i had uh leafeon umbreon and sylveon left that i had to do this evolve the second time and so since i was able to use the it takes less time to evolve into a sylveon i could get that done quickly and then i did umbreon that night and now i'm level 42. did you need nice did they add sylvia to the 42 i said all eight evolutions because when i did 42 sylveon wasn't even the game yet well then i mean counts because it counts it counted for me because i just did it today okay um i will say i was in the game when i was 42 so obviously that was skipped yeah we i mean we didn't play for very long uh we were there for an hour and a half and then we were all like we're hungry and i have 13 chinese let's go we walked three miles and then it was like burger time yep and we went and got burgers i mean there's only so long we can talk about trashing steve yeah you know as a group well not sitting down sitting down exactly we brought up all of the energy to continue the conversation [Laughter] [Music] uh this was sent in by casey f in our slack community uh several johto pokemon are added to the chinese version of pokemon quest starting next month i don't know why this is i i know why this is going around i shouldn't say i don't know why this is going around but i think it's it's not surprising to me because i've been following pokemon quests in china and they've added a lot of things there's like pvp in that game and there's some other stuff so the johto pokemon being added isn't shocking but to shock our audience that are like oh joe the game in china isn't even developed by game freaks i don't know the exact deal and i don't know if anyone knows the exact deal uh i went to the wikipedia page here and just says developer game freak i don't know who the chinese developer is but there was a deal between the pokemon company and a developer in china to make pokemon quest a thing there and to reach that audience which is very big and there there has been a ton of updates like i said pvp some other stuff um added like some downloadable content that has been exclusive to china for however long the game has been out so that came out like right before let's go pikachu let's go eevee but i think the chinese version started like six months after that uh i don't know too long didn't read the stuff is probably never coming to america because obviously nothing prior to it has come and i don't think this developer is making this developer's not making a worldwide game they're making a game specifically for china to fit their audience and there's a bunch of games outside of pokemon that have been always exclusive to china i think there's like a exclusive call of duty mobile game that's china only and there's probably i can think of two mobas off the top of my head that are exclusive to china but i am sure there are way more than that yeah there's a lot more i'm sure so it's it's cool i had i don't know i feel like it would've been the same point i made for pokemon snap is you know all these people asked for dlc the dlc came where were these people when it arrived greg didn't even play it okay once people get a thing they generally don't go on uh social media to say hey i got this thing they generally just go and play it i was very at the top of the world anytime waluigi is added to the game yeah when it's added do you hear it when why luigi hits the actual game do you see a bunch of people posting all the things about waluigi no they're satisfied and they go sit in the room and play the game maybe i follow too many smash people you follow too many special others i also told you up front that i was just going to watch you play the game and not play it because rosalia was not added that i was going to sit down and get as much enjoyment of watching you stress out about the things as me stressing out about the things so very much he's playing final fantasy 14 is what's happening well that is y'all the grind is killing me i don't know maybe on wednesday they say hey we're bringing we're bringing back quest we're bringing back quest we got we we're working on a brand new arceus game but hey we put five people on what you should probably find out is that they set a financial target for quest and it was like it has to make this much money for us to do expansions and it made that much money in china but it didn't make that much money anywhere else so you're like you know what china you win the sweepstakes everybody else everybody else go scratch too bad you lose because you snoozed yeah i mean also like making good stuff takes time they're making a diff they're making a they're making arceus i don't know uh i'm pretty sure control c control v takes note oh right right control c very very well command on the apple computer oh come on i don't know i forget it's apple they're probably using graphic designs on macs so somebody has to sit and make all these cubed johto pokemon look just pull it out of the minecraft servers that were illegally created that's all they had to do yank them out of there they're already cubed yeah just steal the fan-made cubes and then sue them for when they yell yeah it all makes sense it all works out you know i like pokemon quest a lot i don't know if i feel like i would say i would i would go back to pokemon quest when if it had dlc and and i'm just speaking for myself but the pokemon snap thing came out and i played it for four hours and i enjoyed it and i didn't finish it again i'm missing like six of the 20 pokemon but i i there's i don't know if there's a word for it but i felt like that ship sailed like so much time passed it was very hard to get back into it that's how i feel with final fantasy right now that's why i'm like on the fence of re-subscribing and then and snap has a low barrier of entry final fantasy is like oh boy this is not this is the problem with with getting older there's there's two factors that as we get older impact our ability to play games number one when we were younger games were way too expensive and not coming out that frequently so when you got a game you played the heck out of it at top bottom left right all the way through now it's like we get a a good game every two to three weeks something that's really worth playing except those games also still kind of pricey except we now we have more money so we can throw that money away well i don't like it i'll spend 60 in overwatch play for five minutes realize i hate it never play it again sure sure well it is like a psychology thing right like unite does this with bot matches uh i don't even don't we we'll talk yeah we'll have a conversation here but there there is in i don't i don't know if people notice this right away but if you are in not great expert if you're an expert rank and you lose three times in a row you are guaranteed a bot match which means that if you go into a match you're gonna see what you normally see whether you're solo or with a group and then there's two ways to tell before the match starts when all ten pokemon are queued up if you tap on the opponents they'll have this blurry zoomed in face and they'll all have that face and it's impossible to recreate on your trainer card um and then once the match starts you'll probably just destroy them because they're bots well have you gotten have you gotten the thing where you are the only player and everything else yes spot because you don't destroy them at that point if you did not realize it was a bot match and pick something that could actually do really good scoring so in the choice picture so if you well i always tell like i should be in a bot match when i'm picking my pokemon i'll pick aldegast like i always do and then suddenly everybody picks picks theirs and then i'll go switch to gardevoir and then they'll all rearrange yeah like this is 100 an all bot match and i'm going gardevoir because i need something that can do a lot of damage and score so that i could at least win this game with a bunch of bots who are programmed to do the exact same thing so all they do is run away from each other and it's just me running around trying to take care of everything and then uh when the match is over you can good job your team but you can always good job the enemy team if you want and in a bot match you cannot good job bots now they like i said they do look like humans so my my assumption is they take two human teams and then they grab the names and then they split them off or they're fighting a bot version of you and you're fighting a bot version of them how dare they but i do not approve the use of my likeness for these robot wars but i think going back to like snap and quest and how i feel like it's been so long where they add dlc and it's just like you you like that ship has sailed like it's so hard to get back i'm sure for some people listening they'll be like oh i've eat up pokemon quest dlc like i'm sure you you will but but i there has i don't know what the psychology is but in unite it feels like and i don't know if other mobas do this but like oh if our player keeps losing they're going to walk away from the game unhappy and then they're less likely to come back versus if we serve them a match where they're almost guaranteed to win and they win they may continue playing or they end on a win whereas the next day they're going to come back and be like well i stomped that last team so maybe today will be a good day so it's the old white men can't jump that's what it is so easy to tell that it's a bot match i i i feel like once it's pointing out to you yes but i'm i have to like point this out to people every single day and it's funny because you never would have realized that much attention week of the game i remember people posting on twitter these like landslide victories and it's like i guarantee you that was a bot match i mean no i know what i've had there are no bots but in in veteran which is after there are if you lose five matches in a row you are forced to bot match and to be fair like it does prevent you from ranking down so it's kind of nice i personally don't think it feels it feels depends on where it hits because i have ranked down and gotten a bot match after i've ranked down it's like too late i've i've already ranked down so uh this is getting me nothing uh also i will say that not all of those screen shots are bot matches because i have been stuck with an all human team and have just watched them get steamrolled and watch them do nothing but sit well some of them just sit and they're throwing the game and i'm like you are you are throwing this game i know you're throwing this game yeah it's easy to get a landslide it's gonna be a landslide because you because you've just thrown the game and i am immediately reporting you the minute we get done and i do uh i also i will i will tell this secret i've run out of black spots i have reached the max amount of people i can block what um i don't know you could block people yeah yeah it's like right i don't know the good job yep and like above the right i don't know and i can't see everybody who i blocked so i don't know how many that was but i was on a blocking spree for a while where i'm like no you literally sat there i never want to play with you again you threw this match yeah i don't want to deal with you ever again i don't want to play put in the situation i don't know why okay so now number two rule of what will make will anderson not like a game number one was if i have to do homework no number two if i have to prune my own garden for a good play experience i'm out no thank you i mean like i i have probably blocked like 10 or 12 people but they were people it wasn't like oh like everyone has a bad match you know there's there's been matches where it's like i was the worst i'm sorry i i was i didn't mean to throw i didn't mean to like keep walking in and dying um [Music] but if there's a person who is just sitting in base after two minutes and just giving up i never want to play with that person again like there's just too many times in unite where you are losing for eight minutes yeah and your team finally clicks and you get it together and you get zapdos and you start defending and you win there's just way too many times for that so if somebody two minutes in thinks the match is completely over i i don't even know if they know zapdos is in the game like have you gotten that far in the match like well what's also frustrating is if they had just disconnected the game will take over for that they'll realize they're disconnected and will run that one that was chosen as a bot these are people who are deliberately not disconnecting they are just staying in the game moving around every so often so that the game thinks oh they're still connected and throwing the game and it is so aggravating and i've run into them so many times which is why i met my max block yeah i haven't had i i probably almost all my blocks are probably the first week or two of the game this last week i haven't blocked anyone i think i've only reported one idol um i um anyways is just like a psychology thing i think with i also think like investment in a game will state how quickly you come back if there's a dlc right like people who are very invested into quest who really really like quests like they are people in slack who are buried at the game the dlc they really really love that game they were invested in the game and they're just waiting for a reason to go back your investment and how much it clicked with you like i barely played any quest i didn't find it all that enjoyable um and there's there's literally nothing that's gonna probably ever bring me back to that game because i just didn't enjoy it um and there's other games that you can be heavily invested in that once once you're done and you sort of reflect on it and you think actually i wasn't really having that much fun i was just i was just excited that it was new i wasn't enjoying myself that much also will stop you from going back like there are a lot of people who are very excited about quest coming out and played a lot of it but ultimately looking back at it like well did i enjoy the gameplay that much would new characters make me want to play that game again and honestly sometimes the answer is no um you know there's a million reasons as to why you stick with and why you leave a game a lot of them are just there are other things and if something catches your interests more and gives you a similar experience i'd rather play that than go back to this yeah well let's take a break uh when we come back we got some masters news that's actually it's actually kind of exciting masters news but uh we got some afternoons and we got some other stuff so we will be right back [Music] hey uh what do you guys think about pumpkin spice skin spice pumpkin spices pumpkin spice frosting flakes pumpkin spices pumpkin spice mini wheat pumpkin spice [Music] dr pepper [Music] we got the peppermint mocha [Music] and we are back from our break it's almost here greg the two-year anniversary of pokemon masters yeah and they released the best pair beforehand and i got the best pair and i never need to play that game again uh you can go to my instagram to see the butt cape it is truly i thought you were talking about sydney and absal the best no no suit leon in his side cut cutie outfit and his butt cape and his pulled back ponytail hair i had the best commentary on that of course cannot be repeated you cannot say these things because this is a good show and you are a bad person correct full disclosure i have a partnership with dna uh this is on pokemon.com hop and zamazenta and signa suit leon and eternitus are in pokemon masters ex from august 11th through september 15th the new pokemon masters ex legendary event howling shield of eternity brings reports of a mysterious meteor landing on the island along with the potential of the sighting of eternitis playing through this event will award you gems three star move support move candy 4 star strike move candy and a new sink pair of hop and zamasunta their hop is free you just have to yeah you just have to play the game as you play through the story of howling shield of eternity you will see hop gloria and leon team up with new friends to aid eternitis solving the mystery of the legendary pokemon's arrival may uncover the secrets of the dynamaxx phenomenon on pot on passio the event also debuts cigna suit leon and eternitus in sink pair scouts i think it's a fair scout right 10 yep they are currently the only sink pair capable of dynamaxing which they can do once per battle did they talk about the other leon being able to dynamics is that no press release because like that's gonna happen right like there's no way historizer doesn't dynamics yeah it i'm not overly thrilled at how dynamic saying has been put in the game um it's just weird it is it just not a sync i haven't well i don't have i thought eternities couldn't dynamics it oh so the story explains the change oh um but it doesn't actually change forms at least eternity doesn't and it is it is a dynamics move that you can click once whenever you want you can use it whenever you are it's not a sync move it's not a it's not a timed thing it's there from the beginning so if you want a dynamax at the opener you can do it but you can only ever do it once it is no it is fundamentally no different than a sink pair move except it's not on a timer and once you've used it it won't come back up again screenshot here it shows the hand version of eternitis yes so which is the dynomax form so it that's the animation for the move okay when you go back to the screen it turns out i see what you're saying it does not like so if you haven't played masters when you you can beg of all the masters in case anyone didn't like they still support megas in other games it's like it didn't disappear when i i feel like there's this there's this audience of pokemon players that once sword and shield came out they thought like megas completely got vanished no they exist in other games in other games they're in pokemon go they're masters so when you use a sync move in masters on stephen's metagross it will mega evolve into mega metagross yep and it will look like mega metagross and it will have different moves once not like not it might change like two moves but it will have different moves as a mega but what you're saying is eternitis dynamaxes for the turn and then after the animation is over it goes back to normal it's back to normal i'm going to verify it again in case i've missed something but i i i don't ever remember it staying the hand for the rest of the battle let me go into something quick we'll go there uh we'll go there we'll hit ready and i will because i usually just finish the game with it but i will start the game by by doing the dynamax uh dynamics dynamics oh come on uh i'm trying to see if they mention anything about charizard or dreadna in this press release i i would just assume that that's i mean they say other ones will but they don't say well i mean like come on it's kind of obvious which ones are going to and which ones are not going to yeah so i get the hand animation see there's the hand oh i see the hand it does its big beam it blows everything up and then when i go back to the screen you can see it it is oh it's regular i see it regular plain old regular which uh it's kind of a bummer like megas are more exciting uh and i don't know i expected it to at least like change form for for three countdowns or something but it is literally just a off clock one-time sync move and that's very powerful but so are all the sync moves it it feels it feels implemented a little a little disappointing just to turn a test maybe charizard will be like three it could be i mean this is the only example that we have and it turned and i mean even though it does do the hand form that would be it doesn't stay big and cloudy it just goes right back to normal and i don't know how they're going to implement it for the other ones and maybe they will take on their other form for three countdowns who knows but right now i'm not apart from the fact that leon looks amazing i have not been too impressed by the addition of dynamics his outfit's real good it's so good i'm trying to get a number of cosplayers i know to create the outfit do it do it dude there is a five star select special scout coming soon which features b and nessa and then up for the run-up to the two-year rally um you can get up to 2600 gems just by logging in i'm so curious who's gonna be in the two-year anniversary what champion have they are they gonna change the name of the game again maybe for the two-year anniversary okay let's never forget that their hashtag pokemon masters uh triple x this is going into the third year didn't work for i mean maybe it did work honestly because that was the talk of the town that day when they started using that new hashtag for pokemon masters ex drew a lot of attention to the game true i'd like there's nobody on this on the launch screen that isn't in the game now that i remember they've added everybody they've added sigma suits of all the kanto folk so we're tapped out the there are professors left we don't have birch we don't have elm we don't have okay juniper there's zero people in the world being like oh man i'm gonna pick this game up what professor birch gets at it because we have sycamore yeah okay he has xerneas which is literally get zernius and you beat the game every time xerneas is so crazy powerful yeah there's there's not very many champions that they haven't added either because i mean alder's in the game cynthia's in the game diane is in the game leon's in the game twice gary's in the game twice uh steven stone's in the game wallace isn't well they just added faulkner you know people were uh they added uh bugsy and scyther yeah i don't know who's li i don't i'm just people like oh wait for the two year wait for the two year and i'm like why i don't know who's coming in the two year and sigma suit leon looks real good and i got it first pull first but here's the thing of gotcha games is would they do this all the time they like something exciting happens and they put out something to like bait you into spending your gems before that like i don't think faulkner or sydney were good bait but they were obviously bait before leon but leon is bait for something leon to say leon is bait is to do a disservice of how incredible leon looks in that outfit oh he looks great he looks great he looks fantastic and it is a tournament and eternity is a great partner it is a good attacker like if where he loses the cape oh okay he's definitely yeah if if leon loses the cape i'm putting money into the game look their whole goal with this mobile game is to make money right their two-year anniversary like there's there has to be something better than leon which is hard to top what is better to beat than than super hot leon in his side maybe possibly like cigna suit ramos you know people are really i mean if they do if they do a good rama i i'm i could be there you never know if this is bait this feels like the best bait they've ever done because it is 100 worth it to have this guy wandering around your pokemon center saying hi to you and you're like yeah hi leon let's go well i mean leona's best champion correct they could do a signa suit deantha there you go oh yeah i mean i'm into that too see that's bait or that's not bait that's like but no i shouldn't think that that's better than signa suit leon and how amazing that outfit is i mean the weird thing is they've been adding weird pairs to the bp system like we got the rose champion and entei in there and i'm like what why is she in here where did this come from although the vp system is really good yeah i don't i don't know what they will do for two years besides like the thing i feel like i do know is they're like okay dreadnough charizard um what's the other one that was added like the these could not dynamics i'm sure that they're doing that i mean i would imagine that the only thing i can think of is there might be some sort of g-max pikachu uh but would they le would it be i feel like that's an event to get that to be your pair like they did with solgaleo and what other one they did that with where you fight through the thing and then at the end you can partner with this special pikachu that can yeah gigantomax even if they i don't know even if they release like opal or milo like that's i know you like milo but that's not nearly as exciting as leon like champions are always more exciting than the gym leaders for them for most people i mean for most people i mean i would spend my i i won't spend money on my life i will spend all my coins on milo and then when i don't get it i'll be mad and stop playing the game for three weeks but i'm i'm literally just like people are like oh the two years should be super super great and i'm still struggling to figure out how they top the two year was pretty good we got we got leaf and red that was the one year i'm saying what what oh sorry what tops this leon nothing nothing if they were so confident to put out this leon and for like if you if you have not played masters if you've made it through this segment you need to go go look at pictures of this layout go to my go to my twitter you'll see the front and the back of this amazing super great leon here or go to my instagram you'll see the top the front and back of this super great leon here it is leon is the bait fours mere bee and luna cola come into the game mirror b and ludicolo i was off to spend money on that yeah mirror b i'm in i would also waste all my coins on on mirror b oh man mirror b had better come soon or this game is a ripoff yeah guzman's in it cyrus lucamine's in it cyrus is in it giovanna's in it uh martial is that the female leader of giovanna uh archie and maxie are in it yeah uh they could probably have scissors in it they haven't added a courtney technically okay they could do sigma suit n yeah yeah yeah i think cigna suit de antha would go more than and would i don't know people like n a lot of people like really like people like the anthem though i love diantha so i use the answer whenever i can uh like kakui is in there olivia's in there like there's porous they haven't done cholera yet then call risk but nobody's nobody's pulling for coal rest let's be real wow i mean that's already has paracorous faulkner or cindy cindy was an ad that i was not expecting at all because i had forgotten that sydney existed uh yeah like what is sydney even from which ca if you even forget what game cindy's from is he not from owen is he not e4 holland oh he is e4 owen god i forget he exists every time the whole elite four is not great they're a lot of forgettable until you get up to stephen stone and wallace wow well okay i'll take that back phoebe is amazing uh drake is forgettable uh is it who's the ice person glacia oh glacia she's already in the game and forgettable yeah i forget her all the time she's no canned to ice she's no canned ice who is missing wand is missing uh okay you know again i think what is missing falls into the faulkner department [Laughter] uh is there any champion no i think that's no they've done all the champions i i could i literally could not figure out who who this incredible this incredible leon would possibly be bait for like how are you going to exceed what you just did for the two year and i don't think they can i mean they could do another red with a gigantic max pikachu yeah but you i feel like that is weird since you have your own pikachu and that's how you start the game i think it's weird to give a giganta max pikachu not to your character who's had pikachu the entire time they could do and i'd like a jesse and james with gigantomax meowth they couldn't do that in the anime technically yeah i mean jesse and james were thinking but who would they give it to jesse or james or would they do it both they could do both i mean what does matter weird but sure yeah do we i i don't unite a stall in the mind before we move to like question the week pokemon of the week do we have anything on unite i mean i'm super frustrated by the by the play to win aspect of it uh i haven't paid to win or play to win because playing to win seems appropriate pay to win pay to win the pay-to-win so uh it is it is a hard wall that if you do not want to level your stuff past 20. you have a rough road 20 yeah i'll tell you the secret stop playing ranked and just play unranked free-for-alls yeah and have some this is the clash royale problem i i mean i did do i i tried to go into unranked free-for-all and the amount of people that just had no idea what they were doing was more frustrating than playing ranked where i was where i lose all the time because i can't move out of my bracket because i think the way it pulls the way it pulls people to play is tough because you are at a point where people if it's pulling from expert or lower they can't move past 20 in their items until they hit veteran and when it opens up to level at the 30. and if you're playing above that everybody has leveled way beyond in their stats or something i think you need to be a veteran i think you just need to be an expert to go past 30. or whenever it happens yeah but like it is a hard wall to hit and it is a frustrating wall especially since if you leveled up a number of items and the most recent patch made a bunch of those items no longer worth the level you can't undo those upgrades so like shell bell was great because it did cool down and it made elder goss's heels really strong because the cooldown was a lot less well now that the the cooldown was extended so much the three percent that you got doesn't make enough of a difference to keep using that item so i had shell ball up to 20 and now i had to level a different item to replace it up to 20 and that is in that process if i didn't want to spend money i had to earn gems playing with a subpar item either way it's just it is it is an aspect of the game that i i really hope leaves very quickly i didn't like it when it started i really hate it now and i think it is already becoming a problem in the game i i think it is a problem i don't wanna i'm not going to defend that it's not but when the season is over you're going to get so many tickets depending on where you rank um so you if you're ranking veteran i think you're getting fifteen thousand tickets or something yeah the season ends in forty eight days yeah which is enough time it's enough to max one item completely to 30 and i think if anyone's listing the show the item you max is buddy barrier because it is probably the most versatile item like even if you're like ah buddy barrier doesn't really work on i don't know it works on every pokemon but even if you were like i don't think it works on mr mime it's like well it's not bad on mr mime it's not like it's literally not a bad item for any pokemon it's not the best item for every pokemon but it's it's one of the like that's how i think about it is like okay if i'm going to upgrade items because i i have i think i only have four items at level 20. um and then i have a bunch of tickets i just refuse to spend them because i don't want to get into the situation where you know i put everything into shell bell and shaw bell is broken or shelble's not good anymore or um so 20 has been good i mean i've talked to a lot of people that have made it to master rank they've all made it to items with it being at 20. there's like this new i don't know game on twitch where a bunch of streamers made new accounts so they can be like i'm free to play to masters and you know they're good players so they end up getting the masters anyways i don't i had somebody come to my chat and be like oh is this your alternative account oh buddy i got no alt account i got time to play this game twice no i'm one account it's fine i have no desire i i i get it it's like content it's like a fun challenge to be like i'm going to play this game again and i'm going to do free to play and it's like it's the nuzlocke of unite is what it is yeah and it's like i don't want to make a new account i don't also the the sort of thing behind that is you made an account after you know how to play the game right like you have already on your main account know which items to upgrade so yeah you're free to play but you're free to play with a ton of knowledge that you gained from your other account so you are using what you did to target exactly the characters that you want to level that you're good at and you know exactly which items to level it is it is not an even playing field at that point either because you have three weeks of experience you're not starting over again you know exactly how to target your games yeah and it's also difficult to like level items to level the four or five items that are good across multiple characters like you sort of have to say i'm gonna do a subpar build on a couple of things that if i can't play the main i'm gonna do with these um it is just it is a it is a frustrating solo experience um i'm getting to the point where i'm like do i really want to continue doing ranked if i'm not in a group that i can talk to or at least i have a level of confidence that they are not gonna stand in the end zone they're not gonna do xyz you know they're not gonna throw a match like what like what is my path forward of unite um and what does that look like given given the sort of uh as more people get to the same skill level of the game the pay aspect becomes way more prevalent see i i have not hit that paywall um i'm not saying it doesn't exist uh like i'm i'm as of this recording i'm veteran three and the last time i play i haven't played in like two days because i've just had time off um the last time i played uh we i did a three a group of three it's me two other people and then two randoms and we won we won one we lost one then we won seven in a row and then we lost one so we ended up going like eight and two for the night or something yeah i mean it's a very different experience when you can get at least two other people who who kind of know what's going on and you have you have all those slightly delayed communication yeah well in that situation of these eight matches two uh yeah we won eight one eight lost two so in these ten matches we were completely stomped by another team it was like we we ended up ending the match at like level 11 or 12 and they were all level 15. and like that's a huge disadvantage in that game like if somebody like if you're zero or over zero aura and you're 10 and they're 12 they're just gonna win yep like the level advantage in that game is is very it's not bad it's just that's how the game is um and being self-aware of like oh gosh you know that this this person's two to three levels higher than me i just can't beat them without support it's just part of the game and it's fine like i'm not complaining about it it's just you just got to be aware of that and they just completely stomped us and i wanna and like it's like well they were better like they were probably all outcomes they were probably a team but i i like you look back at that situation i was like i have no clue how they did it like even even in our games when we get dreadnought both times maybe even three times i don't even like i i don't think i've ever been a game where i'm 15. maybe 13 maybe like i'm always 12 when zapdos appears and if i'm not 12 when zap disappears i'm playing poorly something happened where like dreadnought or not i can be level 12 by zapdos um and i can't help but think that was like oh you've you've paid your money and you're a team and that's like we got completely stopped like so whatever if whether or not they paid money they were they were the better team and i wasn't super salty about it and it's like we won seven in a row we got completely destroyed by this team like it's really hard to be upset like seven in a row is really good at um veteran so i haven't hit that like oh every team is stomping us but i do think three up is better than five up as at least right now yeah because i mean is good if you have communications five but the problem with five up is you're gonna you're gonna get against another five up that has communication so here's the question do you like hard to introduce inability to re-watch a match i think they're adding that they did like a three-day yeah testing i don't think that they can do like a full esports competitive without that because that would give you the ability to sit and watch oh yeah right yeah i would love to be able to see what they were doing but yeah how did you get to 15 so fast like let me let me see your path i mean while i hit was that veteran four and i have since dropped down to veteran one from four like i have just had a solo queue has been real real real rough uh which i'm like i think i need to play with people but the the hard wall i hit was in veteran i hit it at four and nothing i could do could get past it yeah i mean going back to like the the twitch meta game of you know free to play solo only to master rank and like lots of people have done that i mean these people the thing that i like i kind of i was i was kind of like jaded slash bummed that you know i'm a very competitive person i play a lot of competitive games outside of stream um you know i i always did like trials of osiris and destiny uh you know i've done vgc stuff i've done tcg stuff and so i was like a little bummed i was telling greg this it's like oh man i'm seeing all these people get to master rank and i'm not master rank yet and of like a lot of these people have like 700 games under their belt and i'm only at like 220 or something but the thing i forgot is all of these people were secret league of legends players for like seven years and then when i thought about it i was like i'm thinking about streamer friends that are all master rank and it's like i didn't realize that you've been playing league of legends since like 2012 like 100 absolutely true it's insane how you don't think about it well like people like some people like they live and breathe league of legends right they're consistently talking about it and then some people are like i would i don't this is my guilty pleasure i play at like 4 a.m when no one's online and it's a big like it's a reason why league of legends is like top three game on twitch all the time like people love that game and hate that game well i think people also just like one thing in what you just said people don't realize how long league has been around yeah right i forget that it's been around for such a long time i was playing in 2012 2013. i was playing eight years ago and there are people who have just consistently played throughout that entire time and this is my first moba so like it's been baby's first moba yeah i mean it's also sort of a thing where i watch like i watch master people playing the characters that i play and i'm like i do all these things and like without without the ability to sort of look back and see exactly what the other people were doing with what i was doing it's hard to grow doing it by myself which i think i sort of needed to get like three people and like let's just knock it let's just play some so i can you know it's also hard being support when people don't people just leave you i'm like well i guess i'm going with everybody else because i literally could do nothing by my own down here you've all left and you didn't signal you were leaving i just looked and oh you're all up there all right it i mean it also doesn't it also doesn't help that like the meta is still changing like yes i think we said last week you know no one cared about dreadnought when the game first came out and everyone cared about rotom and now like dreadnought it like no one cares about rotom and everyone cares about dreadnaught and there's like this weird meta game with zapdos and it's some people still don't like zapdos um i like zapdos i'm fine with it it is a ketchup mechanic and it is when you sort of realize that the dreadnought fights are the first previews of what your team fights should be zapdos doesn't feel that weird yeah yeah i feel like because teams are rotating down to dreadnaught twice a match and it doesn't feel like zapdos is that weird versus the first two weeks where no one was going to dreadnough and no one was like leaving and then you because you know we we joked about how you know greg and i would play together and i wouldn't see greg until the last minutes of the match so like they open up lane i don't know how what i don't know what greg's doing i don't know what's happening down there i have no clue but now that the the game is like okay at seven minutes everyone is moving to dreadnought maybe one person stays behind um like i get to see greg more often right i'm like oh you're down here you're doing things cool um and you can evaluate the situation when you get down there like did their team move down yeah how like how is it a disaster down here what what why are there orbs everywhere it's interesting because player i think players have become more aggressive because of that and like i had to stop using pollen puff because leaf tornado with it's speeding up your uh your allies attacks while they're in that stream is a better support option for me than the passive healing i would get from pollen puff that's on a longer cooldown or it's a slightly slower kill down but like the healing takes a while before it goes off so in this in the as the game has progressed it players have gotten more aggressive for those team fights and things like pollen puff that are more passive just aren't worth it and i've had to switch my playstyle to say okay playing goss i need leaf turning to way more often because i need to be doing that damage and giving that speed advantage and attacks to my team because it is so aggressive right now yeah and the thing the thing about zapdos is it felt like the first week or two everyone was trying to take zapdos right and then the the meta change where if the game goes you're in the lee or a huge lead then if you're the huge lead you go oh we we don't attack them we don't attack zapdos we keep them from getting disaster and now now the what i feel the like meta is is if you're a huge lead and you're like cool let's all go to zapdos and defend the team goes oh we're just going to go to your bases because we know you're going to zapdos yeah we're going to dunk but like there is so many things happening at zapdos that doesn't even include zapdos at this point right the game and so i still stand by i don't think zapdos is a bad mechanic i think that people just didn't understand or were like super salty it's like well we were winning the entire game and then uh we lost zapdos so it sucks that we were winning for eight minutes and we lost and it's like okay you can defend you can take you can split your team to go to their bases and ignore zapdos and force them to like retreat like there there are so many options you have and and the dreadnaught battles i think really lay out what your final game plan should be which i think makes zapdos a stronger mechanic of like how are like dreadnought is mini zapdos yeah and how how are those battles going how you can see how your team functions at that point you can see how their team functions at that point and then you could just have a match where we we literally spent eight minutes fighting dreadnaught fred not showed up and we sat down there the entire time and literally until dreadnought despawned and zapdos popped up and was like oh nothing got like what is this match right now yeah that gets them wild there's some wild matches yeah yeah yeah uh i all in all i i it's good i like it a lot it's first it's frustrating because yeah it's teamwork but i i i just i just need to find a team to to just like re-level set my enjoyment of the game uh and sort of like help me deal with the sort of internal frustrations of dealing with with random players question of the week uh oh yeah hold on question of the week what is the question of the week that's mario [Laughter] what you need one of those little pitch pipes to like oh yeah i do but that's me like a lot i mean i have to dig up my old one oh this is good this is from miles from our uh patreon slack what fantasy creature that currently does not have a pokemon counterpart would you like to see added in the next gen well where is the next gen yeah um as i say unicorn we got rapidash uh i'm trying to think of fantasy creatures that aren't in the game i know it's kind of like we really got to stretch do we don't really have like a mermaid that's the first thing that came to my mind oh yeah that's true that's true i was thinking of more of a humanoid mermaid like a mr mime slash jinx situation but yeah maybe that's for the better obviously we don't have it we got impedimp we don't have pegasus but we have tropius uh we don't have a pegasus that would be pretty cool did you say tropius was close to a pegasus it is a large winged flying forklift creature yes i don't know prophets doesn't have hoofs dinosaurs didn't have hoofs they had toes uh manticore i can see a manticore working i don't think we have a manticore so a manticore has a line for the lion for the for a head has wings and then it has a scorpion tail stinger yeah eagle it's like a lion eagle scorpion yeah what about the the harry potter dog cerebrus yeah a three-headed dog yeah we have like a three-headed dog we have dodrio we have well we have a hydragen oh yeah we do have a high dragon yeah that's like uh that was like in hercules though right you know cut off a hydra it was like a hydraulic but they didn't do nine heads they only did three uh what else we have imps we have a kelpie kind of minotaur do we have a minotaur i mean tapu bulu they've all been taken there's nothing my head keeps going back to like harry potter stuff because i'm trying to like uh i mean that's very western there's other cultures and mythologies out there yeah i'm uneducated and we don't have a chimera really lion lion basilisk do we have a basilisk we have an arbok [Laughter] do we have like a pixie i mean we have we're bombi we have celia and we have uh floor just yeah those all fall if anything fairy falls into the pixie realm we have enough dragons so that's out do we have an oni uh uh yes uh glace glailey oh yeah we have glailey dad we we just like we know too much that we can't even like trick ourselves trying to think of things in hercules i mean there's that there's like that pig man thing like pig man bear pig that's not elise he's like writing stuff he has like hooves he's a little shorter rounder i don't know sound like danny devito oh a seder oh is that what it's kind of like yes that's a creature right yes it means he a pig i don't know what he is not a pig oh he's a goat that hurts i like how you knew it we got there together though we eventually got when i realized you were referencing hercules the disney movie yeah yeah yeah because you're like a man in hercus i was first thinking hercules the tv series i'm like i'm pretty sure you've never seen that and also you don't like disney so i was like which hercules are you pulling from we gotta we got what about xena warrior princess yeah she should just be in the man i spent so much of the 90s saying exactly that sentence because i was a huge xena fan i was a huge fan uh there isn't really a two-legged goat man in the game pokemon i mean the humanoid ones we kind of want to avoid i mean grumpy ain't doing anyone favors no what's the horse with the eagle head uh oh oh oh griffin griffin could do a griffin yeah we could do a griffin i could do it for a griffin we did quetzalcoatl we got that already um that's it i'm sticking with manticore okay i'm sticking with pig man goat air man pig bear meant pig ah this is from our youtube if you would like to ask a question uh you can leave a comment in our youtube on the newest episode and we'll try to get to it this is from void of sin also i don't know hit the like button and the subscribe hit the like and subscribe subscribe and like uh i don't know if we're doing it but what is your ideal for gen 9 i would love a new pokedex like gen 5 had it was super exciting to play for the first time you never know what you're going to find next well people certainly hate that yeah so i mean so what do it what do i want i feel like that would be a good gen 10 thing like every five years you do a fresh pokedex and force people to i i mean i would like gen 9 to be set in either brazil or australia yay i was gonna say egypt no egypt i feel like egypt is a is a good ten because it's got a lot of mediterranean and you can pull on kalos and you can pull on other things and like there's a lot around that area so that feels like a ten thing to me yeah i feel like an isolated island like australia where nobody knows what's happening there it's like a giant mystery and most of that land is trying to kill you makes a great very dangerous pokemon very dangerous pokemon like you cannot there were sharks in the flooded streets at one point every spider is deadly every person is potentially deadly it is a wild frontier and is a good for gennady so when i was at the grocery store today i obviously was trying to catch shiny eevees so i had my pokeball plus attached to my belt and i literally had this thought i was like they should make a pokemon game where the pokemon trainers are more like pokemon players in today's day and age in the real world where it's like they're not the most popular people right maybe they're slightly looked down on by society and you have to prove your worth um and like you know prove how cool you are because you're a pokemon trainer it's not just like oh you train pokemon you're a great cool dude we live in a society where being a pokemon trainer is not so cool and then you have to like work around that as part of the story i mean i could also see them going back to japan i mean like actually with a given market they need to go to china yeah uh yeah there's more money there than anywhere else uh but also like you know unova was just new york and the surrounding areas like it wasn't all the united states alola was just hawaii a huge desert in the middle of new york it's amazing yeah um like kalos was just technically france like it wasn't so sorry paris it wasn't like all of france well i guess maybe so i mean there are a bunch of things like the the palace is clearly a nod to versailles like there's a bunch around paris and the surrounding regions yeah so like as much as i would like australia would they do all of australia or would they do like one coast oh cut off perth dude like nobody else is just the stretch between sydney and melbourne the only two areas that people actually live in oh now all of our brisbane listeners have just dropped because nobody lives in perth i everybody who has sent emails saying i'm from perth has spoofed they're spoofers they really live no i mean i believe in perth it's just it's kind of like [Laughter] it's kind of like newark new jersey it's oh yeah it's there it's there but why it's like does does not where mexico mexico would be cool yes uh but yeah i just like it's it's it's not be in a video game level of cool show me one like huge perthian monument where it's like oh worldwide record like you know you've got the sydney opera house you've got zach perna in melbourne [Laughter] i'm typing in what's famous who's closest to the rock in perth i know you're not supposed to call it ears rock anymore but it's uh is that close to perth or where is that apparently there's a zoo in perth i mean there's a zoo it's outside my window most days frogs man well pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon uh the key references were that you had you couldn't encounter it in the old days until you had passed through route 102 it has a split evolution in pokemon unite it only involves into one of those because there's no dawn zone uh and for one of its evolutions it can be either male or female but the other evolution is male only but they both have the final evolutions have megas uh i thought that that was enough but i also said mentioned that it has a pre-evolution so if you were thinking of the first one that's not it it's the one in the middle it's munchlax a pre-evolution there's nothing before a munchlax it's girlia pearlia how do you say that one get out the 3ds yeah what's the correct pronunciation for curlia uh it's dead it has been powerful [Laughter] i think it's corelia though i think it's girlia do you guys know what curly in photography is no okay so that's where you take a piece of living material and you put it on a photo plate and you do an electrical charge through the photo plate and it oh it makes like an aura around the pieces oh yeah no no that's familiar uh shuffle shuffle icon is awesome but the shiny i am such a fan of this line anyways and the shiny line is so good it's very good so good there was uh back in the day our listeners probably remember travis they were on way too many episodes love them to death they're very happy to be on too many i've been on more than them well at one point they were on longer than anyone else besides me that's true and i the the gardevoir line has always stood out to me because they always made a big deal with the fairy split at the time uh because they were upset that you know their favorite psychic i think i think it was just pure psychics correct yes and then it was like well they were not big on fairy and then they added fairy to their pokemon and i i get in retrospect like i get it you know you're changing a pokemon that somebody really likes but uh travis ended up really liking the fairy after the fact but it was a lot of commotion back in the day before gen 6 where we were arguing whether fairy was good or if it was the right thing um so that this line has always reminded me of them which is i'm i'm very team fairy fyi just so oh yeah i love uh there's a fairy travis throw back for our listeners that remember i mean like they didn't die i mean they moved to canada they may have died that's true you can still hear wheels a lot on my show so um corelia shares the category with mess spirit and indeedy they are all known as the emotion pokemon i think i also mentioned that curlia's number in the cinno pokedex platinum only and uh el mia bowser are the same what is this browser that's the that's oh the the yeah okay yeah can we please get a pokemon ranger game please please maybe they'll announce it on on wednesday curlya and it's evil stop evolutionary relatives are the only pokemon that are in both the amorphous and the human-like egg groups amorphous there's no i oh i was thinking matrix you know irene has never seen the matrix well good she's better off for that good good for her good life choices irene well done we were watching a documentary about woodstock 99 and they brought up them wow that was a very documentary about i had to live through that yeah why it was a very good documentary it was on hbo max uh it just came out like a month ago so it's like no fire festival it made fire festivals seem like a real palace i didn't sometimes you don't realize how much of a mess something is until somebody lays it all out for yeah that it also that documentary also just reminded me of how lousy the late 90s early 2000s were it was awful look when you look back on any decade and you're like yeah there was a lot that was real messed up we were just getting through it at the time i'm surprised we did i think the thing that stood out to me that they said is everyone in 1999 wanted to be mad at something but there wasn't really a reason to be mad and i was like you're right there wasn't really a reason to be there was a reason to be mad all these computer programmers had used shortcuts and now we were going to have the millennium bug and we were all going to die because of lazy computer programmers wait till i tell you about the energy crisis of the 70s it'll blow your mind do you think people listening to the show i would hope most of our listeners know what y2k was right uh no no no no no i mean what a given so the average age of your listeners is what like 25 so they were children i was a child i was 12 years old i remember difference between 4 and 12. you were almost a teenager they were children like young children who didn't have to deal with it at all if it was very uneventful it was also incredibly uneventful it was a thing that that we were all panicking about in every business in the world had to go through because i was there a scramble to check every line of code to make sure that when it flipped over it didn't break like for people who were adults that that entire time period was awful because if you worked with anything with a computer if you had anything that had a computer chip in it you had to deal with everybody coming at you to check it is it going to work what are you going to do and then you had people who are like my toaster has a computer chip in it and it's not going to give me toast tomorrow and like the com the conspiracy theories all you kids were spared from that a lot of you teens were spared from it those of us in the working corporations 1999 was a terrible territory also of being of the age of understanding where it's like people were honestly like not only was my toaster not going to make toast it's going to explode in my house my refrigerator is going to explode because it can't handle the change in the year planes are going to drop out of the sky because they can't handle this also there was uh is gonna lock up all my bank accounts and i'll have no money i have no money i'll have no money all my bank accounts will lock up and it and since everything's on computers it will drain them all like there was a lot of fear-mongering around it and some of it was true like these things could have happened but the amount of work that we had to do that year of trying to check literally every line of code that ever existed was awful and then they decided to have another woodstock for reasons well but the thing about that getting back to the source here which we haven't even gotten to the real pokemon of the week is that the previous woodstock the 25th anniversary one was really good oh 94. yeah yeah it was a really good one it was like five years later let's destroy the concept this makes like the worst experience possible all right here we go this week's pokemon i may have gotten this wrong so good luck if we get this correct or not the clue was actually the us talking about woodstock the pokemon of the week is snoopy's [Laughter] did you know woodstock actually didn't even happen in woodstock new york i've been to woodstock new york either way in the pokemon games that brought us such standout pokemon like xionatic and steeny there are also some pokemon that are quickly and easily forgotten this can get a bit tricky so pay close attention this week's pokemon shares the first part of its name with the dubious celebrity that some have said was the inspiration for what comes third after it in the national pokedex you would remove the last letter from that celebrity's last name the back half of its name is derived from one of its physical features a feature that it shares with only one other pokemon evolutionary line that was first introduced in this region that is unless you count sea creatures as potentially having the same it's so easy greg yes that facial expression says it all you are going to need to write all that stuff in that channel copy and paste copy and paste monday and i'm going to
