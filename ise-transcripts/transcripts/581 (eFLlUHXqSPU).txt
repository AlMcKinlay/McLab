what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:28)
581st episode I think that's right uh (0:26 - 0:31)
81st episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:28 - 0:33)
super effective uh with me today is (0:31 - 0:35)
Hannah (0:33 - 0:38)
I am here I've been playing a bunch of (0:35 - 0:40)
go with the new season started (0:38 - 0:44)
oh there's a bunch of tasks to do called (0:40 - 0:47)
ah don't ask me names of things season (0:44 - 0:52)
of Adventure sink I don't know (0:47 - 0:52)
stand to improve that (0:52 - 0:57)
that's a thing speaking of improving (0:55 - 0:59)
we're improving our show by bringing (0:57 - 1:01)
will back this episode all right and (0:59 - 1:02)
I've been playing a lot of armored (1:01 - 1:05)
course six lately except not a lot (1:02 - 1:07)
because that game is really hard (1:05 - 1:09)
we gotta get the two machine guns that's (1:07 - 1:12)
what everyone's using okay (1:09 - 1:13)
okay listen (1:12 - 1:16)
did either of you guys look okay number (1:13 - 1:19)
one folks I ain't changed one bit so (1:16 - 1:22)
here we go listen did either of you ever (1:19 - 1:25)
play Earthworm Jim no no I mean yes but (1:22 - 1:28)
like okay so there was an issue with (1:25 - 1:32)
Earthworm Jim that the first mini boss (1:28 - 1:35)
in the game not even the first boss of (1:32 - 1:36)
the first level but the first sub boss (1:35 - 1:38)
that you had to get through before you (1:36 - 1:39)
could even get to the boss of the first (1:38 - 1:40)
level (1:39 - 1:45)
was so hard and you had to have like (1:40 - 1:47)
special skills and things in order to (1:45 - 1:51)
get past it and then after that the next (1:47 - 1:54)
10 levels of the game super easy but for (1:51 - 1:55)
some reason they made the first mini (1:54 - 1:58)
boss really really hard you got that (1:55 - 1:59)
steep learning curve in there okay (1:58 - 2:02)
that's armored Core six they literally (1:59 - 2:05)
like this this is ridiculous they throw (2:02 - 2:07)
you in they're like oh you landed on the (2:05 - 2:09)
planet here go do this kill these people (2:07 - 2:11)
blah blah blah attack this police (2:09 - 2:14)
helicopter I'm on the ground I'm not a (2:11 - 2:17)
helicopter so it took me like literally (2:14 - 2:19)
three days to figure out how to defeat (2:17 - 2:21)
the police helicopter guess what happens (2:19 - 2:25)
after you defeat the police helicopter (2:21 - 2:28)
you get a room where it's like okay now (2:25 - 2:31)
you can practice all of the skills that (2:28 - 2:32)
you need to play this game with any (2:31 - 2:34)
capability (2:32 - 2:36)
all right a little too late friends but (2:34 - 2:38)
anyways it's fun it's a good game I like (2:36 - 2:41)
the sword I like having my sword so now (2:38 - 2:42)
that you've defeated police helicopter (2:41 - 2:44)
are you ready to defeat Mewtwo in (2:42 - 2:47)
Pokemon scarlet and violet I don't (2:44 - 2:50)
imagine that I have anything that is of (2:47 - 2:52)
sufficient skill to (2:50 - 2:54)
I have never done a single rate I (2:52 - 2:57)
haven't done raids (2:54 - 3:00)
in the crown Tundra Ah that's not true (2:57 - 3:02)
that's probably the last place that I (3:00 - 3:05)
did yeah Dynamics Adventure didn't you (3:02 - 3:07)
yes that's that's what I did do yeah (3:05 - 3:09)
well I was trying to get that Shiny (3:07 - 3:11)
Rayquaza and then we gave up (3:09 - 3:14)
got it all right well okay so I have a (3:11 - 3:17)
Shiny Rayquaza now yeah that's true you (3:14 - 3:21)
did uh you did what 10 hours of go Fest (3:17 - 3:25)
probably uh yes because you took a nap (3:21 - 3:28)
but no no I but the two days combined (3:25 - 3:30)
was like (3:28 - 3:34)
more than 10 hours yes (3:30 - 3:34)
um well Will's back for the episode Greg (3:36 - 3:41)
is at DragonCon Bobby is sick Cody is (3:37 - 3:44)
collecting bees uh and Bob is in another (3:41 - 3:48)
state so this is our lineup for today (3:44 - 3:48)
and we're recording at seven o'clock at (3:49 - 3:53)
night so I couldn't ask anyone in the UK (3:50 - 3:54)
but Will's back so that's exciting I'm (3:53 - 3:57)
excited (3:54 - 3:57)
we have some Pokemon dudes this is a (3:58 - 4:03)
Pokemon show uh we've been starting off (4:01 - 4:04)
with Pokemon sleep every episode so (4:03 - 4:07)
let's start off there it was the first (4:04 - 4:10)
good sleep day which was technically (4:07 - 4:13)
like a three-day event I would say (4:10 - 4:15)
um Hannah you want to explain what (4:13 - 4:17)
happened with good sleep day you're the (4:15 - 4:22)
it was you're the Sleep expert I am (4:17 - 4:22)
it was a three-day event where there (4:23 - 4:28)
were two days before and after the full (4:26 - 4:30)
moon where your sleep score was (4:28 - 4:33)
multiplied by 1.5 times what it would (4:30 - 4:35)
normally be and the one day in the (4:33 - 4:36)
middle the day of the full moon it would (4:35 - 4:39)
be multiplied by two times I believe and (4:36 - 4:41)
so that just means that throughout that (4:39 - 4:43)
entire event you're sleep your sleep (4:41 - 4:45)
score would be higher you would find (4:43 - 4:47)
more Pokemon each morning (4:45 - 4:49)
it was pretty great you also got a whole (4:47 - 4:51)
bunch of free sleep points throughout (4:49 - 4:53)
the whole three-day event which I have (4:51 - 4:55)
so many sleep points now I can buy a (4:53 - 4:58)
master ball easy (4:55 - 4:58)
will have you played Pokemon sleep zero (4:58 - 5:04)
percent I feel like this is a game for (5:01 - 5:06)
you though you are so consistent with (5:04 - 5:09)
your day I know you care about sleep and (5:06 - 5:14)
this is the issue because I have my aura (5:09 - 5:16)
ring I've had my aura ring for quite (5:14 - 5:19)
some time now and I actually didn't know (5:16 - 5:21)
you had one oh yeah (5:19 - 5:23)
um I asked will about it before I got (5:21 - 5:27)
one I've had it long enough that my (5:23 - 5:30)
first one died and they gave me a free (5:27 - 5:32)
replacement because they were like you (5:30 - 5:35)
are too skilled with this thing but the (5:32 - 5:36)
problem is (5:35 - 5:40)
I check it every morning I'm like so (5:36 - 5:42)
obsessed with checking how well I slept (5:40 - 5:45)
and that I literally get upset when it (5:42 - 5:47)
says when I think I did a good job (5:45 - 5:49)
sleeping and it's like no you were (5:47 - 5:51)
actually awake 15 times during the night (5:49 - 5:52)
and you only got four hours of sleep (5:51 - 5:54)
when you thought you got eight and like (5:52 - 5:56)
I don't need more (5:54 - 5:58)
more things telling me I'm too (5:56 - 6:00)
rambunctious well the good thing is (5:58 - 6:02)
Pokemon sleep is an awful sleep tracker (6:00 - 6:03)
yes (6:02 - 6:07)
it's really just good more upset no no (6:03 - 6:09)
no no no no see this is why I think you (6:07 - 6:11)
would like to disregard that part you (6:09 - 6:13)
rely on the aura ring for the actual (6:11 - 6:14)
sleep tracking and then you play Pokemon (6:13 - 6:17)
sleep as a game that revolves around (6:14 - 6:19)
sleep but it's still Pokemon but then it (6:17 - 6:22)
just gives you another thing to check in (6:19 - 6:23)
the morning and I know you love doing (6:22 - 6:26)
that kind of stuff I certainly do but I (6:23 - 6:29)
also charge my phone on the the (6:26 - 6:32)
the osmosis charger (6:29 - 6:34)
so I can't put it on my bed (6:32 - 6:39)
you're not buying the go plus plus (6:34 - 6:42)
it's gonna happen well if I gave you a (6:39 - 6:45)
free go plus plus would you play it (6:42 - 6:47)
you'd be wasting your money no no it's (6:45 - 6:49)
not wasting my money the Pokemon company (6:47 - 6:51)
sent me a free one yeah well then I'd (6:49 - 6:54)
probably just take it short okay (6:51 - 6:57)
the deal is done Papa Pokemon is playing (6:54 - 7:00)
for Will's sleep now no I think I think (6:57 - 7:01)
you would like it because you check it (7:00 - 7:03)
in the morning and then I usually check (7:01 - 7:05)
it around lunch time and then I'd check (7:03 - 7:06)
it before bed and that's kind of the (7:05 - 7:08)
gist of it (7:06 - 7:10)
it just sounds like it's gonna be (7:08 - 7:12)
another I'm gonna be sitting there doing (7:10 - 7:15)
20 gifts every morning and getting upset (7:12 - 7:17)
because my buddy doesn't like me enough (7:15 - 7:19)
and I have to have him like me 30 times (7:17 - 7:21)
in a row and then I'm late for work and (7:19 - 7:24)
I'm fired but I have a free go plus plus (7:21 - 7:27)
hooray yeah okay yeah but I can catch (7:24 - 7:31)
Pokemon yeah yeah yeah uh yeah I I got (7:27 - 7:34)
my first shiny in sleep after five weeks (7:31 - 7:36)
now or whatever I think you and Greg (7:34 - 7:39)
both did after I asked last week oh wait (7:36 - 7:41)
what did Greg get I don't remember but I (7:39 - 7:43)
saw a slightly different colored Pokemon (7:41 - 7:45)
okay yeah that's you know that's the (7:43 - 7:47)
gist of of shiny Pokemon (7:45 - 7:49)
um yeah I think uh the good sleep day (7:47 - 7:51)
gave 500 points the first day and then a (7:49 - 7:53)
thousand on good sleep day and then of (7:51 - 7:55)
500 points the day after or something (7:53 - 7:59)
like that uh and then they released a 25 (7:55 - 8:03)
limited edition bundle that you that you (7:59 - 8:06)
could get because the game is very good (8:03 - 8:09)
at asking for money so now I'm paying to (8:06 - 8:11)
sleep no no no no this was just (8:09 - 8:12)
completely optional it was the good (8:11 - 8:16)
sleep day bundle volume one that you (8:12 - 8:17)
could get from Monday so it was (8:16 - 8:20)
available for a full week it gave you (8:17 - 8:23)
nine great biscuits two Focus incense (8:20 - 8:27)
two luck incense and two growth incense (8:23 - 8:29)
um just like Pokemon Masters ex (8:27 - 8:35)
uh or Pokemon cafe mix for some reason (8:29 - 8:38)
Pokemon games are very money grabby (8:35 - 8:40)
maybe that's maybe maybe I don't play (8:38 - 8:41)
enough other mobile games well what (8:40 - 8:43)
other mobile games are you playing and (8:41 - 8:44)
how much money are they asking for you (8:43 - 8:47)
uh I play one other mobile game it's (8:44 - 8:49)
called Angry Birds and they ask me for (8:47 - 8:51)
no money because I get it with my Apple (8:49 - 8:54)
arcade subscription oh it's one of those (8:51 - 8:57)
games (8:54 - 8:57)
see I've beat the system you gotta play (8:57 - 9:02)
the Hello Kitty game I also pay for the (8:59 - 9:05)
Apple family plan and have like not my (9:02 - 9:09)
family all benefiting (9:05 - 9:09)
wait did you not play the Hello Kitty (9:09 - 9:13)
game enough (9:11 - 9:13)
it's like Animal Crossing I well you're (9:14 - 9:20)
not you're not making a sale right there (9:17 - 9:21)
there's like (9:20 - 9:24)
andrio characters that I care about and (9:21 - 9:25)
the rest of them I don't ever want to (9:24 - 9:28)
see or acknowledge so all right that's (9:25 - 9:30)
fair (9:28 - 9:34)
Pokemon sleep is a still a game (9:30 - 9:37)
um okay let's uh shift gears over to the (9:34 - 9:38)
Mewtwo raids (9:37 - 9:40)
um YouTube made its debut on Thursday (9:38 - 9:42)
August 31st it will be around until (9:40 - 9:46)
Sunday September 17th realistically (9:42 - 9:47)
Mewtwo is probably going to last until (9:46 - 9:49)
uh (9:47 - 9:51)
like the 12th because who's possibly (9:49 - 9:53)
going to be doing me too after the DLC (9:51 - 9:56)
came comes on the 13th but (9:53 - 9:59)
uh I mean it makes sense that they run (9:56 - 10:00)
it over just in case because people are (9:59 - 10:04)
going to come back for the DLC so (10:00 - 10:04)
um it says on pokemon.com here that (10:05 - 10:10)
Mewtwo cannot normally be encountered in (10:08 - 10:12)
paldea what that actually means is (10:10 - 10:14)
there's no pokedex entry for me too just (10:12 - 10:16)
like there isn't for chart Charizard or (10:14 - 10:19)
Greninja uh Mishi will be a psychic type (10:16 - 10:21)
Tara that means bug ghost and dark type (10:19 - 10:24)
will deal super effective damage (10:21 - 10:26)
um don't forget you can still add the (10:24 - 10:28)
mythical Pokemon Mew to help you topple (10:26 - 10:30)
Mewtwo during the event and something (10:28 - 10:32)
very special will happen when you send (10:30 - 10:34)
Mew into a terror raid battle against (10:32 - 10:38)
Mewtwo they don't ever actually say what (10:34 - 10:39)
happens I will tell you what happens (10:38 - 10:43)
number one is Mew gets a 20 stat boost (10:39 - 10:46)
for all of its stats except it's HP stat (10:43 - 10:50)
where it will get a 50 HP boost (10:46 - 10:53)
um so mu if you if you did Max HP from (10:50 - 10:56)
you it would be 404 and then because of (10:53 - 10:59)
the boost your Muse HP should be 606 (10:56 - 11:02)
which is uh hot very high that's a lot (10:59 - 11:04)
of HP (11:02 - 11:06)
um also if you defeat Mewtwo with a mu (11:04 - 11:09)
your mu will get the mightiest Mark (11:06 - 11:11)
which is the first time your own Pokemon (11:09 - 11:15)
can earn it versus catching (11:11 - 11:17)
um said mu (11:15 - 11:19)
and then me too I again I don't know why (11:17 - 11:22)
they just don't say these kind of things (11:19 - 11:24)
uh but that's fine Pokemon (11:22 - 11:28)
um Mewtwo has uh size strike which I've (11:24 - 11:29)
learned this past week a lot of people (11:28 - 11:31)
don't understand what that move does but (11:29 - 11:35)
that's fine it's like a physical psychic (11:31 - 11:37)
move it's a special psychic move (11:35 - 11:42)
do damage based on your physical attack (11:37 - 11:45)
physical defense stat (11:42 - 11:47)
um which (11:45 - 11:49)
is unique I guess in its own way it has (11:47 - 11:53)
Ice Beam it has Aura Sphere (11:49 - 11:56)
and then it has call mind and rest (11:53 - 11:59)
and like the Seven Star Pikachu Mewtwo (11:56 - 12:02)
will start off with a raid shield and (11:59 - 12:05)
like the Seven Star Pikachu Mewtwo is (12:02 - 12:06)
also holding a held item it's holding (12:05 - 12:08)
the chesto berry which means that it (12:06 - 12:10)
will wake up from sleep although I don't (12:08 - 12:12)
like I don't think that held item (12:10 - 12:14)
matters too much because if you've done (12:12 - 12:16)
six star raids before like it's very (12:14 - 12:18)
hard to keep a six star or seven star (12:16 - 12:20)
raid boss asleep they wake up (12:18 - 12:23)
so fast anyways (12:20 - 12:23)
so just so they can use rest without (12:23 - 12:28)
taking a penalty yeah yeah (12:25 - 12:32)
so even if you whatever knock the berry (12:28 - 12:33)
off which I actually don't think it (12:32 - 12:36)
works um I don't think knockoff Works uh (12:33 - 12:37)
on the berry but if you could knock the (12:36 - 12:39)
berry off I don't think that would have (12:37 - 12:41)
mattered too much because I don't ever (12:39 - 12:43)
remember a six star raid boss being (12:41 - 12:45)
asleep for more than one turn they wake (12:43 - 12:48)
up so fast uh there's a lot of thoughts (12:45 - 12:49)
on this raid (12:48 - 12:51)
um Hannah did you have a chance to do it (12:49 - 12:54)
yet I did I played maybe six times on (12:51 - 12:56)
the first day that it was out and lost (12:54 - 12:59)
every single one and then after you're (12:56 - 13:01)
updated builds came out I went and won (12:59 - 13:03)
the next two the next day it was great (13:01 - 13:07)
okay well there you go easy (13:03 - 13:09)
once once y'all had figured out the (13:07 - 13:12)
actual way to do it it's not as hard as (13:09 - 13:16)
it seemed at first yeah uh the The Raid (13:12 - 13:18)
builds I put out first (13:16 - 13:20)
um obviously (13:18 - 13:22)
I I feel like when I do rate builds I'm (13:20 - 13:23)
I feel like I'm like a sports (13:22 - 13:25)
commentator of like well I think it's (13:23 - 13:28)
like a 92 chance the Detroit Lions are (13:25 - 13:29)
gonna win but there's like eight percent (13:28 - 13:32)
chance that Brett Favre will interfere (13:29 - 13:36)
and somebody will hit a hole in one like (13:32 - 13:38)
you could (13:36 - 13:41)
you just like take all the knowledge you (13:38 - 13:42)
know of Pokemon and you make like the (13:41 - 13:45)
best Edge for the audio podcast (13:42 - 13:47)
listeners will is looking very (13:45 - 13:48)
distraught right now (13:47 - 13:51)
um I'm just like I'm pretty sure bet (13:48 - 13:55)
Brett Favre retired but whatever go on (13:51 - 13:55)
like making the most educated uh uh (13:56 - 14:00)
choices that you can based off the (13:58 - 14:02)
knowledge of the game you know how so (14:00 - 14:05)
like the first set of raid Pokemon I (14:02 - 14:07)
built for the most part they do work (14:05 - 14:12)
it's just like such a slog that way and (14:07 - 14:15)
you really this is not unique to me too (14:12 - 14:16)
well maybe it is but like obviously (14:15 - 14:18)
having people all on the same page and (14:16 - 14:20)
understanding what they're doing and (14:18 - 14:23)
paying attention to the stat boost is (14:20 - 14:24)
the biggest thing (14:23 - 14:25)
um (14:24 - 14:27)
I think the the tricky part about this (14:25 - 14:29)
right I said this in my updated video is (14:27 - 14:31)
that when YouTube com uses call mind (14:29 - 14:35)
sometimes it gives a plus one call mind (14:31 - 14:38)
boost like it works normally and then (14:35 - 14:40)
sometimes it's just like a plus three or (14:38 - 14:42)
a plus four (14:40 - 14:44)
um which is you know if if Mewtwo's (14:42 - 14:46)
neutral and then all of a sudden it has (14:44 - 14:48)
plus four special defense and plus four (14:46 - 14:51)
special attack uh that's very (14:48 - 14:54)
overwhelming or can be it's bad (14:51 - 14:56)
um now (14:54 - 14:59)
when this raid came out people were (14:56 - 15:01)
saying oh this is broken and it's (14:59 - 15:04)
impossible to beat but this mechanic has (15:01 - 15:05)
existed in the game before there's (15:04 - 15:07)
actually a six star dragon knight that (15:05 - 15:09)
does this with Dragon Dance (15:07 - 15:12)
um and I was very confused when I first (15:09 - 15:13)
experienced that (15:12 - 15:15)
so (15:13 - 15:17)
I don't have a problem with this and I (15:15 - 15:19)
think like this is like the there's like (15:17 - 15:21)
two different conversations here number (15:19 - 15:22)
one is I don't have a problem with (15:21 - 15:24)
Mewtwo boosting at Stats four times in a (15:22 - 15:27)
row that's fine like whatever he's like (15:24 - 15:29)
a seven star legendary raid if he wants (15:27 - 15:31)
to power himself up more than the rest (15:29 - 15:33)
of the game allows cool (15:31 - 15:35)
I do have a problem with and this is a (15:33 - 15:38)
different conversation is the game doing (15:35 - 15:41)
a very poor job at communicating that (15:38 - 15:43)
um because (15:41 - 15:45)
if (15:43 - 15:47)
if you're so used to like paying (15:45 - 15:48)
attention to what they're doing and (15:47 - 15:49)
you're actually paying attention I'm (15:48 - 15:51)
like okay I saw him sword stance okay I (15:49 - 15:54)
saw this nasty plot okay he's he's using (15:51 - 15:56)
iron defense twice like you're thinking (15:54 - 15:58)
of that and and if you're paying (15:56 - 16:00)
attention to your raid buddies you're (15:58 - 16:02)
like okay so and so struggle bugging (16:00 - 16:04)
this person just light screened uh I'm (16:02 - 16:05)
not going to light screen they just (16:04 - 16:07)
lights green right like you're paying (16:05 - 16:08)
attention to everything in the match but (16:07 - 16:10)
when Mewtwo just decides to call mine (16:08 - 16:12)
four times in a row there's nothing on (16:10 - 16:13)
the screen (16:12 - 16:16)
that signifies that is happening and (16:13 - 16:18)
there are instances where sometimes it's (16:16 - 16:19)
just one (16:18 - 16:21)
um where you know people were explaining (16:19 - 16:23)
well some some of these are scripted and (16:21 - 16:25)
some of these are not scripted that's (16:23 - 16:29)
great that is not helpful like (16:25 - 16:31)
a basic player should not understand (16:29 - 16:33)
like well these moves are specifically (16:31 - 16:36)
scripted and then these are not because (16:33 - 16:38)
like I I don't you don't need to know (16:36 - 16:39)
that as a player right but like if (16:38 - 16:42)
you're seeing the boss side strike if (16:39 - 16:43)
you're seeing the boss nasty plot if (16:42 - 16:45)
you're seeing the boss call mind (16:43 - 16:48)
and it's doing more than what it's (16:45 - 16:51)
communicating to you on the screen I do (16:48 - 16:52)
think that's like (16:51 - 16:55)
annoying because especially when you (16:52 - 16:57)
have to go into the menu that may or may (16:55 - 17:00)
not freeze your entire raid as you're (16:57 - 17:03)
trying to finish this timed experience (17:00 - 17:05)
just to check (17:03 - 17:10)
don't do it just just keep hitting them (17:05 - 17:13)
hot tip bring Darkrai he's a dark type (17:10 - 17:16)
yeah use your game psychic type types (17:13 - 17:19)
use your game sharp bring a Darkrai (17:16 - 17:19)
um (17:19 - 17:22)
I saw so that you know there's always (17:19 - 17:24)
the conversation of people think Pokemon (17:22 - 17:26)
games are too easy or people think (17:24 - 17:28)
Pokemon games are not hard enough (17:26 - 17:29)
and then (17:28 - 17:32)
I thought Mewtwo was fun like obviously (17:29 - 17:34)
once you figure out the puzzle it's (17:32 - 17:37)
pretty straightforward uh it's a little (17:34 - 17:39)
long it will say that even when you are (17:37 - 17:41)
completing the raid it's a little long (17:39 - 17:44)
that's what we call getting your money's (17:41 - 17:46)
worth (17:44 - 17:46)
that's the Pokemon Community is so vast (17:47 - 17:51)
right there's so many different players (17:50 - 17:53)
at so many different ages and skill (17:51 - 17:55)
levels and stuff that you're not you're (17:53 - 17:57)
not going to please everyone (17:55 - 18:00)
um with that kind of stuff but (17:57 - 18:03)
for a rate of group content and for (18:00 - 18:05)
Mewtwo being the first legendary Seven (18:03 - 18:07)
Star raid I think they did a good job I (18:05 - 18:08)
think it's really great (18:07 - 18:11)
I think that over the next couple days (18:08 - 18:13)
people will develop new strategies that (18:11 - 18:15)
don't rely on mu but I I don't think (18:13 - 18:16)
there's anything wrong with bringing you (18:15 - 18:18)
like you're getting the Boost if it's (18:16 - 18:21)
your Mew from Pokemon go that you've got (18:18 - 18:22)
from the Masterwork research which would (18:21 - 18:24)
be shiny it why would you not want to (18:22 - 18:25)
bring that you want to get you have a (18:24 - 18:27)
very limited time to get the mark on it (18:25 - 18:29)
that's like a really cool moment in time (18:27 - 18:32)
that you can capture so (18:29 - 18:33)
um I I saw some people were like bum (18:32 - 18:36)
like oh I I wish I could bring some (18:33 - 18:39)
variety here like you can it just might (18:36 - 18:42)
be harder or (18:39 - 18:45)
not as smooth right like uh (18:42 - 18:48)
I saw somebody bring an orangaroo and (18:45 - 18:50)
they were using light screen and they (18:48 - 18:53)
were instructing Muse and they were (18:50 - 18:55)
using whatever other moves and reguru (18:53 - 18:56)
had so I don't know look at this move (18:55 - 18:57)
set (18:56 - 18:59)
um and then I saw some people frustrated (18:57 - 19:01)
that like oh only bug type works that's (18:59 - 19:03)
not true like you can use a dark you can (19:01 - 19:06)
use a ghost like instead of using leech (19:03 - 19:07)
life (19:06 - 19:10)
um use crunch instead of using (19:07 - 19:13)
um leech life use uh Shadow claw I think (19:10 - 19:15)
is the strongest physical type move (19:13 - 19:18)
instead of using silver powder or (19:15 - 19:20)
metronome or you can use shovel instead (19:18 - 19:23)
for dark or ghost like you can have (19:20 - 19:26)
things work and I always bring this up (19:23 - 19:28)
but because it's the two games I played (19:26 - 19:30)
and will has played a lot of Destiny (19:28 - 19:31)
Greg's played a lot of Final Fantasy 14 (19:30 - 19:33)
but (19:31 - 19:36)
in raids in those games which are (19:33 - 19:39)
different Destiny and Final Fantasy also (19:36 - 19:40)
have very different raids from each (19:39 - 19:42)
other people have different strategies (19:40 - 19:44)
of doing things and maybe one strategy (19:42 - 19:46)
is more optimal or more efficient or the (19:44 - 19:50)
one that everyone knows right but that (19:46 - 19:52)
doesn't mean there's not other ways to (19:50 - 19:55)
do those things and some people like (19:52 - 19:57)
that like development of you know what (19:55 - 19:59)
everyone's using Mew I want to see if (19:57 - 20:00)
there's another Pokemon that could (19:59 - 20:02)
actually help out and do this faster and (20:00 - 20:05)
I'm sure that will happen this week (20:02 - 20:07)
that said I was pretty happy with how (20:05 - 20:11)
much everyone got on the same page of (20:07 - 20:13)
using Mew is kind of the thing you do (20:11 - 20:14)
for this raid (20:13 - 20:16)
just when I was playing with randoms (20:14 - 20:18)
pretty much every team was a full team (20:16 - 20:21)
of muse and I was kind of impressed word (20:18 - 20:23)
got out and people stopped thinking for (20:21 - 20:26)
themselves (20:23 - 20:26)
well if the thinking for themselves (20:26 - 20:30)
means you you the Pokemon that we have (20:28 - 20:31)
continued (20:30 - 20:34)
Dale over and over and over again (20:31 - 20:37)
is the one to go with (20:34 - 20:41)
gin is great maybe not for this (20:37 - 20:41)
does any of uh did did any of the raids (20:41 - 20:48)
will make you want to come back nope I (20:44 - 20:50)
don't like raids it was it was like (20:48 - 20:52)
Pokemon experience I'm looking for it (20:50 - 20:53)
was like pulling teeth to get you to do (20:52 - 20:55)
a destiny raid (20:53 - 20:57)
no I love Destiny I didn't like doing (20:55 - 21:00)
Destiny raids with you but I love doing (20:57 - 21:04)
Destiny raids with other people (21:00 - 21:04)
I also I also said this in my video (21:05 - 21:11)
uh that I put out (21:08 - 21:14)
which is like I I really encourage (21:11 - 21:18)
Pokemon fans to play other video games (21:14 - 21:21)
there's so many games out there and I (21:18 - 21:23)
feel like sometimes they don't because (21:21 - 21:26)
I've never seen whether it's World of (21:23 - 21:28)
Warcraft or Destiny or Final Fantasy or (21:26 - 21:30)
literally name a game that has raid (21:28 - 21:33)
content where people complain that they (21:30 - 21:36)
can't solo it that is just not a thing (21:33 - 21:38)
that's just not dead (21:36 - 21:41)
the word raid is (21:38 - 21:44)
doing something as a group right like I (21:41 - 21:47)
use this example on Twitter like for (21:44 - 21:50)
crota you could do crota by yourself it (21:47 - 21:51)
was incredibly hard (21:50 - 21:54)
mm-hmm but that whole experience was (21:51 - 21:57)
meant for six people a Nightfall strike (21:54 - 21:59)
in Destiny is meant for three people (21:57 - 22:01)
could you sit there and do it yourself (21:59 - 22:04)
yes I did it one time it took me four (22:01 - 22:05)
hours and then as soon as two other (22:04 - 22:07)
people joined because I needed to run it (22:05 - 22:08)
twice in a week I got it done in 30 (22:07 - 22:11)
minutes like is it was it possible sure (22:08 - 22:14)
but like that doesn't just because you (22:11 - 22:16)
were able to do something Solo in the (22:14 - 22:19)
past doesn't mean that that's not what (22:16 - 22:21)
the content was originally designed for (22:19 - 22:24)
it this stuff is designed for group (22:21 - 22:26)
situations (22:24 - 22:27)
um and that to all the people that are (22:26 - 22:29)
like well then why does it let you join (22:27 - 22:32)
as a group Again Play other video games (22:29 - 22:35)
I can go into the Vault of Glass by (22:32 - 22:37)
myself and walk around and be like I (22:35 - 22:39)
can't I need three other people to stand (22:37 - 22:40)
on these platforms to open the next door (22:39 - 22:44)
like I can I can go into (22:40 - 22:47)
multiple situations by myself and be (22:44 - 22:48)
like Oh I'm not supposed to be here or (22:47 - 22:51)
like like well but also Destiny was very (22:48 - 22:54)
much like it was clearly designed that (22:51 - 22:56)
you needed people doing different things (22:54 - 22:59)
all simultaneously or you the like you (22:56 - 23:01)
couldn't unlock the door (22:59 - 23:03)
like in all of their raids that's how (23:01 - 23:06)
they were designed so Pokemon just needs (23:03 - 23:08)
to start designing raids where it's like (23:06 - 23:10)
four people have to go into four (23:08 - 23:12)
separate rooms (23:10 - 23:14)
so that you know if you're just one (23:12 - 23:16)
person going in one room and you don't (23:14 - 23:18)
see three other people it's not gonna (23:16 - 23:21)
work I think though that Mewtwo (23:18 - 23:23)
and with the okay so like I think I (23:21 - 23:25)
think Seven Star raids do have that (23:23 - 23:27)
mindset so I (23:25 - 23:29)
really good example is I I do think a (23:27 - 23:31)
lot of the physical raids would be a lot (23:29 - 23:35)
harder to solo if you didn't roll the (23:31 - 23:37)
like Arcanine or the star Raptor RNG (23:35 - 23:39)
because there's no penalty for that star (23:37 - 23:41)
Raptor or the Arcanine dying and every (23:39 - 23:42)
time it comes in it just intimidates you (23:41 - 23:46)
which is UN argue like no one's arguing (23:42 - 23:47)
that intimidate is like one of the best (23:46 - 23:49)
abilities of all time right like it's (23:47 - 23:50)
why it's so popular and competitive it's (23:49 - 23:53)
such a solid such a strong ability and I (23:50 - 23:55)
think a lot of those physical raids (23:53 - 23:59)
would be a lot harder to solo if the (23:55 - 24:02)
Intimidator wasn't sitting there right (23:59 - 24:04)
um and dying over and over and then (24:02 - 24:06)
coming back in and I do think the metoo (24:04 - 24:09)
ray does do a good job of making people (24:06 - 24:13)
have roles like I think if you have one (24:09 - 24:15)
person that's just on healing Duty and (24:13 - 24:16)
when they're healing they're set (24:15 - 24:18)
resetting up light screen maybe they're (24:16 - 24:19)
they're doing like one or two moves in (24:18 - 24:21)
between it's like night and day (24:19 - 24:23)
difference to make that raid go smoother (24:21 - 24:26)
like the first I think two times (24:23 - 24:29)
I went through it (24:26 - 24:31)
um we didn't fail because people died (24:29 - 24:34)
with the Healer was very much on duty (24:31 - 24:35)
and doing their job it was like oh we're (24:34 - 24:37)
just not doing enough damage okay we'll (24:35 - 24:39)
just have to like change a couple moves (24:37 - 24:40)
to just do a little bit more damage like (24:39 - 24:43)
he's it Hannah's right it's just kind of (24:40 - 24:44)
a slog at the beginning to break through (24:43 - 24:46)
that first shield and then once you do (24:44 - 24:47)
it's (24:46 - 24:50)
a lot more manageable but (24:47 - 24:50)
um last thing I will say is (24:50 - 24:54)
again (24:53 - 24:57)
going back to the destiny thing like I (24:54 - 24:58)
don't know how many times will and I sat (24:57 - 25:00)
in a raid and we failed and we failed (24:58 - 25:02)
and we failed and we failed and then but (25:00 - 25:03)
every time we'd get like a little bit (25:02 - 25:04)
closer (25:03 - 25:07)
and then we did it and I feel like with (25:04 - 25:09)
Pokemon fans it's like they failed me (25:07 - 25:10)
too once and they're like up it's too (25:09 - 25:13)
hard must be broken can't do it like (25:10 - 25:16)
like it's it's not that big of a deal (25:13 - 25:18)
like but there's also like with the with (25:16 - 25:20)
the Pokemon reads you can't talk to each (25:18 - 25:23)
other yeah and a lot of the time you're (25:20 - 25:24)
not doing it consistently with the same (25:23 - 25:27)
team yeah with Destiny it's like I could (25:24 - 25:30)
tell you how much you were ruining it in (25:27 - 25:32)
my experience like to your face (25:30 - 25:33)
[Laughter] (25:32 - 25:35)
so that just made it that much more (25:33 - 25:39)
bearable yeah but like even when when we (25:35 - 25:41)
were playing Destiny 1 they didn't have (25:39 - 25:43)
like voice built in so we would always (25:41 - 25:45)
like go to PlayStation chat we would (25:43 - 25:47)
always like go to like (25:45 - 25:49)
you know you make a room yeah yeah we'd (25:47 - 25:51)
make a room right like um but it's still (25:49 - 25:54)
it's still on the console right still a (25:51 - 25:56)
built-in feature of the console oh yeah (25:54 - 25:58)
you're right (25:56 - 26:00)
yeah you're right the switch doesn't (25:58 - 26:03)
have that I mean to be fair like also (26:00 - 26:05)
with Destiny there were web pages you (26:03 - 26:08)
could go to that were lfg web pages and (26:05 - 26:10)
you could like say I need to do this (26:08 - 26:13)
raid This Is My Level blah blah blah (26:10 - 26:17)
blah blah must have gallerhorn of course (26:13 - 26:19)
yeah but those were those were all third (26:17 - 26:21)
party and I know Greg's talked about how (26:19 - 26:23)
like one of the downfalls to raids is (26:21 - 26:26)
like Pokemon needs to do more but (26:23 - 26:28)
with like World of Warcraft or or (26:26 - 26:30)
destiny that like a lot of that raid (26:28 - 26:33)
content was on players of making I mean (26:30 - 26:34)
I think right now besides going to like (26:33 - 26:36)
a subreddit I think most people are (26:34 - 26:39)
using Discord for that kind of stuff (26:36 - 26:42)
um which is like a fine replacement but (26:39 - 26:44)
like we can ask all we want for voice (26:42 - 26:47)
chat or some sort of group communication (26:44 - 26:48)
but like (26:47 - 26:50)
it's a Nintendo platform it's never (26:48 - 26:53)
going to happen well I mean what it all (26:50 - 26:56)
really boils down to is exactly what it (26:53 - 26:59)
says on my t-shirt people one star (26:56 - 27:03)
rating would not recommend (26:59 - 27:03)
I think the me too raids are fun (27:04 - 27:08)
um (27:07 - 27:10)
I think I think there are a challenge (27:08 - 27:11)
that (27:10 - 27:15)
some people want not everyone wants so (27:11 - 27:17)
if you're struggling to do it I will be (27:15 - 27:20)
helping people do Mewtwo um pretty much (27:17 - 27:23)
all week before the DLC comes (27:20 - 27:25)
um so you can come over to Twitch there (27:23 - 27:26)
might be a line there might not be a (27:25 - 27:28)
line I didn't stream a lot this weekend (27:26 - 27:30)
so I don't know how many people (27:28 - 27:32)
shout out to like the Discord and the (27:30 - 27:34)
slack because they were helping people (27:32 - 27:37)
get through Mewtwo's um so that's cool (27:34 - 27:39)
it's like the whole like (27:37 - 27:42)
I taught you all how to fish with my (27:39 - 27:43)
YouTube video so now now you guys can go (27:42 - 27:45)
fish the mewtwos for yourself I don't (27:44 - 27:48)
have to but I will be helping people so (27:45 - 27:50)
if you're listening to this podcast and (27:48 - 27:52)
you want Mewtwo or more importantly you (27:50 - 27:55)
want the mighty mark on your Mew (27:52 - 27:57)
especially if it's your Shiny Mew that's (27:55 - 27:59)
limited like you can get Mewtwo in a lot (27:57 - 28:01)
of games you can get Mewtwo and sword (27:59 - 28:03)
and shield you get me too and the heart (28:01 - 28:04)
gold soul silver being a Mewtwo in (28:03 - 28:06)
Pokemon go but if you specifically want (28:04 - 28:09)
that Mark on you know your the heart (28:06 - 28:11)

all the way up or you're Shiny Mew from (28:11 - 28:14)
Pokemon go (28:13 - 28:18)
you're on a time limit for that so (28:14 - 28:18)
um (28:19 - 28:23)
and uh yeah so (28:20 - 28:25)
speaking of time limit we're going to (28:23 - 28:27)
take a quick break and when we come back (28:25 - 28:31)
we have some more Pokemon news and some (28:27 - 28:33)
free Pokemon coming so we will be right (28:31 - 28:34)
back (28:33 - 28:37)
and we are back from our break (28:34 - 28:40)
uh we got one more podcast before the (28:37 - 28:42)
DLC drops (28:40 - 28:46)
we have no clue what time the DLC is (28:42 - 28:49)
dropping uh could be at midnight could (28:46 - 28:50)
be at (28:49 - 28:53)
1pm like the Isle of armor was well that (28:50 - 28:57)
was central time uh could be at like 7 (28:53 - 29:01)
P.M which I think was the ground Tundra (28:57 - 29:03)
no clue (29:01 - 29:04)
um (29:03 - 29:06)
uh what we do know is for the past six (29:04 - 29:08)
years uh it all comes out at the same (29:06 - 29:09)
time so (29:08 - 29:12)
whatever time it is for Japan will be (29:09 - 29:15)
the same time for everyone else when it (29:12 - 29:18)
comes to DLC uh I know obviously some (29:15 - 29:20)
people switch their Pokemon games to all (29:18 - 29:22)
straight switch their switches to (29:20 - 29:24)
Australia to get the the game slightly (29:22 - 29:28)
early but DLC Mario Kart Zelda Pokemon (29:24 - 29:32)
all seems to drop at the same exact time (29:28 - 29:34)
uh but what we do know speaking of (29:32 - 29:39)
things dropping is that uh a mimikyu is (29:34 - 29:43)
coming to Pokemon scarlet and violet uh (29:39 - 29:47)
good old games yeah (29:43 - 29:47)
this will be a U.S and Canada event uh (29:48 - 29:53)
they don't have an exact date they just (29:51 - 29:55)
said uh October it will be an electric (29:53 - 29:59)
Tara type mimikyu obviously (29:55 - 30:01)
because mimiky was trying to be Pikachu (29:59 - 30:03)
that's the the joke there with the (30:01 - 30:05)
electric I think I mean maybe (30:03 - 30:08)
I think that's an obvious joke so I (30:05 - 30:10)
don't know I feel like that's that one's (30:08 - 30:12)
about right that was a good day for (30:10 - 30:14)
mimikyu that was the day that they also (30:12 - 30:16)
announced the unite (30:14 - 30:18)
oh yeah that is coming to unite as well (30:16 - 30:20)
that means it's a good Halloween Pokemon (30:18 - 30:23)
so yeah that works and I happened over (30:20 - 30:25)
from August to September and all the (30:23 - 30:28)
mimikyu news came out there you go I uh (30:25 - 30:30)
I have been going to GameStop more (30:28 - 30:32)
frequently lately because there's a game (30:30 - 30:34)
that you can only get at GameStop and (30:32 - 30:35)
someday (30:34 - 30:39)
I will find it and I will have it (30:35 - 30:42)
don't matter face no (30:39 - 30:45)
uh what is it it's like (30:42 - 30:47)
of course the name I can't think of is (30:45 - 30:50)
Super Mario 3D (30:47 - 30:53)
All-Stars no it's the yeah yeah it has (30:50 - 30:56)
the Super Mario Galaxy and sunshine for (30:53 - 30:57)
the switch that's where they sold it for (30:56 - 30:59)
a limited time and then they pulled it (30:57 - 31:01)
check eBay (30:59 - 31:03)
okay (31:01 - 31:05)
will Anderson (31:03 - 31:10)
does not eBay (31:05 - 31:13)
ever my mistake (31:10 - 31:16)
no because then you get like you get the (31:13 - 31:17)
the case for the game and there's no (31:16 - 31:20)
card there's nothing inside please you (31:17 - 31:22)
gotta read the auction make sure you're (31:20 - 31:24)
not buying case only (31:22 - 31:26)
nasty um (31:24 - 31:29)
I I think also around (31:26 - 31:31)
I think the mimikyu is also to help (31:29 - 31:33)
promote the uh (31:31 - 31:35)
the booster packs they're doing like (31:33 - 31:37)
season two of The the booster packs (31:35 - 31:39)
which (31:37 - 31:41)
when the original booster packs came out (31:39 - 31:43)
like scalpers were like I'm gonna buy (31:41 - 31:46)
them there's nothing valuable in any of (31:43 - 31:47)
these they're yeah they're not valuable (31:46 - 31:49)
they're just fun the only value is the (31:47 - 31:51)
Joy on children's faces when they crack (31:49 - 31:54)
those packs and see my favorite Pokemon (31:51 - 31:56)
I gave them out for Halloween last year (31:54 - 31:59)
I didn't have a lot of kids in my I had (31:56 - 32:00)
like four kids in my neighborhood or (31:59 - 32:02)
something I sat on the porch for like (32:00 - 32:03)
two hours for four kids (32:02 - 32:07)
they all seem very confused did you give (32:03 - 32:09)
handy and Pokemon cards no I just gave (32:07 - 32:11)
the (32:09 - 32:11)
of them well Halloween is a candy first (32:11 - 32:18)
holiday anything else is supplemental (32:13 - 32:18)
I like the old ladies that would like (32:18 - 32:23)
give pennies when you were I was just (32:20 - 32:25)
going to say can I make a note to UNICEF (32:23 - 32:26)
because this is what they used to tell (32:25 - 32:27)
us when we were kids they were like (32:26 - 32:29)
don't trick or treat for candy trick or (32:27 - 32:31)
treat for Unicef and ask for money and I (32:29 - 32:33)
was like how's about we do this you (32:31 - 32:37)
trick or treat for candy and UNICEF you (32:33 - 32:40)
can do both (32:37 - 32:40)
write that down (32:42 - 32:46)
I don't think I want to do Halloween the (32:44 - 32:49)
this year the uh the kid turnout was not (32:46 - 32:52)
worth the ratio of sitting on the porch (32:49 - 32:54)
I don't think there's just a lot of kids (32:52 - 32:56)
in my I mean there's certainly no kids (32:54 - 33:00)
in my building yeah I'm in that boat too (32:56 - 33:02)
but I think my family got the booster (33:00 - 33:04)
bundles and so they're gonna be handing (33:02 - 33:06)
out the Pokemon cards oh that's cool (33:04 - 33:08)
that's cool yeah they're fun it's this (33:06 - 33:13)
giant bag of really tiny packs of (33:08 - 33:16)
repetitive Pokemon cards they're funny (33:13 - 33:20)
yeah there's like 40 reprinted Ghost (33:16 - 33:22)
Pokemon (33:20 - 33:24)
and I think it's a good price look with (33:22 - 33:26)
the the rising cost of food at the (33:24 - 33:28)
grocery store specifically soda and (33:26 - 33:31)
candy you would be do you would be (33:28 - 33:34)
saving money by giving out Pokemon cards (33:31 - 33:36)
for Halloween you are so you used to be (33:34 - 33:38)
able to get a 12 pack of cans of sodas (33:36 - 33:40)
for like four dollars and it's like (33:38 - 33:43)
eight or nine dollars now preach you (33:40 - 33:45)
almost put me away (33:43 - 33:48)
just that because it costs money and (33:45 - 33:51)
then candy is too expensive as well (33:48 - 33:51)
makes the airport look like a good deal (33:51 - 33:59)
uh okay okay so we are a week out from (33:55 - 34:01)
DLC (33:59 - 34:04)
uh we didn't talk too much about (34:01 - 34:06)
everything before just because I've been (34:04 - 34:08)
traveling there's been a lot of stuff (34:06 - 34:10)
wanted to spend some time especially (34:08 - 34:13)
with Will on the show with DLC around (34:10 - 34:14)
the corner (34:13 - 34:15)
um (34:14 - 34:18)
where where where do we even start well (34:15 - 34:20)
what are your thoughts about long neck (34:18 - 34:21)
ryko (34:20 - 34:24)
oh it looks awful (34:21 - 34:27)
I mean that's (34:24 - 34:31)
like an actual qualified designer in to (34:27 - 34:33)
start redesigning some of these Pokemon (34:31 - 34:35)
like the best thing that people have (34:33 - 34:37)
been able to say about it is I really (34:35 - 34:39)
like they make the clouds around it kind (34:37 - 34:41)
of like a scarf (34:39 - 34:44)
that's the best you can say (34:41 - 34:45)
I know the best thing is that when it's (34:44 - 34:48)
in your battle you can't see its head we (34:45 - 34:50)
already did Too Tall we did that it's (34:48 - 34:54)
still great it's still great it's (34:50 - 34:59)
don't don't steal my thing (34:54 - 34:59)
um okay wait I don't even know can I get (35:01 - 35:05)
that one because I I have the future one (35:03 - 35:09)
I have I have violet (35:05 - 35:12)
ones (35:09 - 35:12)
I would assume that they're gonna put (35:12 - 35:17)
these in raids like they did for (35:14 - 35:19)
um walking wake and well then my answer (35:17 - 35:20)
there is I can't get it (35:19 - 35:24)
oh also speaking of iron Legion yeah (35:20 - 35:27)
no you can't I'm not doing it oh yeah (35:24 - 35:30)
yeah oh yeah you don't do raids (35:27 - 35:32)
so you never got ones aren't as hard as (35:30 - 35:34)
the Mewtwo raids oh I certainly got no (35:32 - 35:37)
walking wake no (35:34 - 35:37)
hahaha (35:38 - 35:40)
good (35:40 - 35:44)
all right I have given up I I gave up on (35:41 - 35:46)
the concept of a living Dex when they (35:44 - 35:49)
did the whole uh Cub Food (35:46 - 35:53)
thing oh because you had to play twice (35:49 - 35:53)
typically you had to play three times (35:55 - 35:59)
yeah you needed Hershey food (35:57 - 36:01)
the other issue (35:59 - 36:04)
come food (36:01 - 36:06)
calorics (36:04 - 36:08)
calorics in the horse oh no that told (36:06 - 36:10)
the Articuno is what killed that for me (36:08 - 36:12)
so (36:10 - 36:12)
um (36:13 - 36:17)
okay so serious question will the the (36:14 - 36:20)
what you saw of the DLC (36:17 - 36:24)
does any of that excite you (36:20 - 36:27)
not Pokemon wise although I like the um (36:24 - 36:31)
I like the we're taking a trip to Asia (36:27 - 36:34)
one more than the we're taking a trip to (36:31 - 36:37)
another alola copy (36:34 - 36:39)
artificial Island one (36:37 - 36:41)
yeah (36:39 - 36:41)
so you're saying you didn't get the DLC (36:41 - 36:44)
yet (36:43 - 36:47)
what like pay for it yeah heck no I'm (36:44 - 36:49)
waiting for that to come with my free uh (36:47 - 36:52)
Pokemon go plus plus oh yeah yeah that (36:49 - 36:56)
special bundle pack exactly (36:52 - 36:56)
um what about uh we we barely touched on (36:57 - 37:04)
poltergeist Poltergeist (37:00 - 37:07)
yes uh last week will you have to like (37:04 - 37:09)
this Pokemon right oh no yeah definitely (37:07 - 37:11)
okay okay I think it's a little stick (37:09 - 37:15)
and it's like you're bad smack smack (37:11 - 37:17)
hahaha (37:15 - 37:17)
um Hannah do you remember what exactly (37:18 - 37:22)
we talked about last week with that I (37:20 - 37:25)
don't think uh yeah I think we covered (37:22 - 37:27)
most of it but yeah (37:25 - 37:29)
what's the pre-evolution (37:27 - 37:31)
did you guys get an answer because it (37:29 - 37:33)
can't be Cindy's job that makes no day (37:31 - 37:36)
no sense it could also have an evolution (37:33 - 37:38)
and not a pre-evolution they are (37:36 - 37:41)
likening it to sinisty specifically (37:38 - 37:43)
despite its name (37:41 - 37:45)
I don't like that (37:43 - 37:48)
so I (37:45 - 37:48)
uh so for the record uh a mini pause in (37:49 - 37:54)
the episode I know there are leaks out (37:52 - 37:55)
there (37:54 - 37:57)
uh for the DLC I have not looked at them (37:55 - 38:01)
well I accidentally looked at one but uh (37:57 - 38:04)
just a heads up there are leaks out (38:01 - 38:06)
there uh why I didn't want to talk about (38:04 - 38:08)
last week is because with the the (38:06 - 38:10)
Poltergeist thing I actually had like a (38:08 - 38:13)
story to go along with it (38:10 - 38:16)
so when I was in Japan and papa pikachu (38:13 - 38:18)
was making me work every day one of the (38:16 - 38:20)
one of the work trips because they would (38:18 - 38:23)
load us on this bus every morning (38:20 - 38:24)
um it was like me and like a couple (38:23 - 38:27)
other content creators and then media so (38:24 - 38:29)
that'd be like comicbook.com like IGN (38:27 - 38:31)
that kind of stuff (38:29 - 38:34)
uh they they took us out to the middle (38:31 - 38:37)
of nowhere Japan it was like a 90 minute (38:34 - 38:39)
drive on this bus and then we were in (38:37 - 38:42)
this uh Tea Garden (38:39 - 38:44)
and they said that they were gonna we're (38:42 - 38:47)
gonna do a ceremonial tea (38:44 - 38:50)
traditional tea ceremony ceremony yes (38:47 - 38:53)
yes uh and it was by a t-master (38:50 - 38:56)
and they were very strict of like okay (38:53 - 38:58)
you know no pictures during the ceremony (38:56 - 39:00)
everyone be quiet and you know you'll (38:58 - 39:02)
have pictures after the ceremony (39:00 - 39:04)
so they brought out (39:02 - 39:07)
um like a red bean dessert thingy (39:04 - 39:10)
uh with like a stick that had a very (39:07 - 39:12)
specific name that was like 700 year old (39:10 - 39:15)
wood the stick was made out of it was (39:12 - 39:17)
all very fancy and so we had our little (39:15 - 39:20)
red bean pastry and then we watched the (39:17 - 39:22)
tea Master make their tea (39:20 - 39:25)
and then they explained how uh you have (39:22 - 39:27)
to like turn the cup (39:25 - 39:29)
because like the cup is like one side of (39:27 - 39:30)
the cup is like beautiful and the other (39:29 - 39:32)
side of the cup is (39:30 - 39:34)
ugly and then you you're supposed to (39:32 - 39:36)
drink the tea and not that's one way to (39:34 - 39:37)
put it (39:36 - 39:41)
um you are respecting the artist (39:37 - 39:43)
that is that's what you're doing (39:41 - 39:45)
and then you're only supposed to take (39:43 - 39:46)
like you're supposed to finish it in (39:45 - 39:48)
like three drinks (39:46 - 39:50)
it was like a green tea (39:48 - 39:52)
or do they explain that they use (39:50 - 39:55)
different uh Bulls to serve you the tea (39:52 - 39:57)
based on what time of year it is (39:55 - 40:00)
ah I don't think they said that but they (39:57 - 40:02)
did talk about (40:00 - 40:04)
you're just supposed to get a thinner (40:02 - 40:07)
shower shallower tea Bowl during the (40:04 - 40:09)
summer so the tea cools off more quickly (40:07 - 40:11)
and a thicker taller one in the winter (40:09 - 40:13)
so it stays warmer (40:11 - 40:15)
yeah then you were supposed to like turn (40:13 - 40:17)
it and then drink three times and then (40:15 - 40:19)
you were supposed to turn it back to the (40:17 - 40:23)
master so the master saw the pretty side (40:19 - 40:25)
so they they'd like explained all that (40:23 - 40:28)
taught us all that obviously was like (40:25 - 40:29)
translated so it was Japanese and (40:28 - 40:31)
English and then we did that whole thing (40:29 - 40:33)
and then they were like we have a (40:31 - 40:36)
special gift for the you know all of you (40:33 - 40:38)
and then they said but the gift was (40:36 - 40:40)
stuck in customs so we don't have it (40:38 - 40:41)
right now (40:40 - 40:42)
oops (40:41 - 40:44)
so the a gift ended up being I actually (40:42 - 40:47)
haven't opened mine yet (40:44 - 40:51)
um a tea like one of those cups (40:47 - 40:53)
that they poured it into I don't know if (40:51 - 40:55)
that cup has I want to say teacup but (40:53 - 40:56)
there's no handle on it it's more like a (40:55 - 40:58)
tea Bowl yeah (40:56 - 41:01)
and then it had um the little like uh (40:58 - 41:03)
whisk thingy which I know has this very (41:01 - 41:04)
specific name but that I remember them (41:03 - 41:08)
saying that like the wood is aged so (41:04 - 41:11)
long that it's so soft that if a bristle (41:08 - 41:13)
broke off and you drank it it wouldn't (41:11 - 41:17)
like hurt you because of how soft the (41:13 - 41:20)
wood became after X amount of years or (41:17 - 41:22)
whatever and then the last thing was the (41:20 - 41:27)
little stick that Poltergeist is holding (41:22 - 41:29)
which has a very specific name as well I (41:27 - 41:31)
don't remember that either (41:29 - 41:33)
the name for the stick is the cha chaku (41:31 - 41:35)
I don't remember the name for the Whisk (41:33 - 41:36)
yes (41:35 - 41:38)
um so that's like the little set that (41:36 - 41:40)
they gifted us (41:38 - 41:42)
um and I have not opened mine yet (41:40 - 41:44)
but (41:42 - 41:44)
based on the trailer and based off the T (41:45 - 41:50)
ceremony I would (41:48 - 41:55)
guess that it evolves into like a final (41:50 - 41:59)
tea product so not a teacup but like the (41:55 - 42:01)
bowl thingy (41:59 - 42:02)
that was what I thought it was going to (42:01 - 42:04)
be originally when I saw everybody (42:02 - 42:06)
showing off the photos of this set (42:04 - 42:09)
that y'all got oh right right right so I (42:06 - 42:12)
I do think it is a reverse synasty (42:09 - 42:15)
because they're saying like if I'm going (42:12 - 42:17)
through the Tea Ceremony only they they (42:15 - 42:21)
made such a big deal about the pot (42:17 - 42:23)
but then the final product (42:21 - 42:28)
is the bowl of tea when you're done hmm (42:23 - 42:28)
and this one is holding the like the Cha (42:29 - 42:32)
Cha what was it (42:31 - 42:36)
yeah okay yeah yeah (42:32 - 42:36)
but I I don't know I it does go around (42:38 - 42:42)
mending (42:41 - 42:47)
the little tea cup bowls things yeah so (42:42 - 42:50)
I mean they're incorporating kinsugi I (42:47 - 42:52)
don't know if that's going to be part of (42:50 - 42:56)
the next thing that is where uh broken (42:52 - 42:59)
cups Bulls plates are mended with gold (42:56 - 43:01)
but (42:59 - 43:03)
uh I'm excited about this Pokemon (43:01 - 43:05)
regardless I think I mentioned last year (43:03 - 43:08)
I took a Japanese teaser last week (43:05 - 43:11)
words I took a Japanese tea ceremony (43:08 - 43:13)
class in college and so I very much (43:11 - 43:17)
enjoyed the methodology of it the (43:13 - 43:19)
um kind of (43:17 - 43:21)
ceremonial aspects of it it's a very (43:19 - 43:24)
cool and intricate thing and I'm excited (43:21 - 43:26)
to see them incorporating it in this (43:24 - 43:29)
Pokemon wait did Greg may have brought (43:26 - 43:30)
this up did he bring up the fact that (43:29 - 43:32)
you can now have an all ghost grass team (43:30 - 43:34)
grass ghost team (43:32 - 43:36)
uh I think I complained about the amount (43:34 - 43:39)
of ghost grass (43:36 - 43:41)
ghost grass Pokemon and then Greg said (43:39 - 43:42)
it wasn't that bad but I actually think (43:41 - 43:45)
it is the most common (43:42 - 43:48)
secondary typing I was so excited and (43:45 - 43:50)
happy about (43:48 - 43:52)
the number of ghost grass Pokemon (43:50 - 43:55)
because that's wonderful (43:52 - 43:57)
there's a lot now yeah (43:55 - 43:58)
there's like (43:57 - 44:00)
seven (43:58 - 44:02)
I think there's eight but sure there's (44:00 - 44:05)
still not that many yeah (44:02 - 44:08)
there are more grass Ghost Pokemon than (44:05 - 44:11)
there are fire fighting Pokemon I (44:08 - 44:12)
thought you were just gonna say there's (44:11 - 44:14)
more grass Ghost Pokemon than there are (44:12 - 44:17)
the flying normal (44:14 - 44:20)
that might still be the the that still (44:17 - 44:22)
might take the cake the other thing they (44:20 - 44:23)
did I don't know if I said this on the (44:22 - 44:25)
podcast is (44:23 - 44:26)
um (44:25 - 44:30)
I here's a personal uh thing about me I (44:26 - 44:32)
don't like super fancy things (44:30 - 44:33)
especially when those fancy things (44:32 - 44:37)
revolve around food I don't think that's (44:33 - 44:39)
true (44:37 - 44:42)
well mostly around food because I I feel (44:39 - 44:44)
like I just don't have good taste buds (44:42 - 44:47)
right like I I I grew up eating butter (44:44 - 44:52)
noodles and uh Jack's Pizza like well I (44:47 - 44:53)
mean it's correct you you not only do (44:52 - 44:55)
you not have good taste buds there's (44:53 - 44:57)
also something just very wrong with your (44:55 - 44:58)
mouth (44:57 - 45:02)
that you feel Foods in some so like okay (44:58 - 45:05)
no other human does so like with the Tea (45:02 - 45:08)
Ceremony which I think like for me like (45:05 - 45:10)
if somebody was asking me experiences (45:08 - 45:11)
Japan I would be like yeah you should go (45:10 - 45:13)
to a tea ceremony but I don't think I (45:11 - 45:15)
would go twice because (45:13 - 45:17)
I don't like tea that much and also like (45:15 - 45:20)
I didn't enjoy the flavor it's not about (45:17 - 45:22)
the Tea (45:20 - 45:23)
the whole thing the ceremony is not (45:22 - 45:25)
about the Tea (45:23 - 45:28)
yes but if you don't like the experience (45:25 - 45:30)
I'm not gonna say (45:28 - 45:34)
it's not about the D okay okay the the (45:30 - 45:37)
the side note when I was in London I (45:34 - 45:39)
went to a t what they call it like a (45:37 - 45:42)
high tea high tea I went to high tea and (45:39 - 45:44)
I loved it (45:42 - 45:47)
I I there was you got like a little tray (45:44 - 45:48)
of different things work out the snacks (45:47 - 45:51)
that's not about the Tea yeah no high (45:48 - 45:54)
tea was tight it was so great ceremonial (45:51 - 45:58)
traditional Japan tea cool but I (45:54 - 46:00)
wouldn't be like excited to go back like (45:58 - 46:02)
I want to go back to high tea again like (46:00 - 46:04)
hit me up with the high tea again (46:02 - 46:04)
um (46:04 - 46:06)
but after okay so after they did the (46:04 - 46:09)
ceremonial tea they were like we're (46:06 - 46:11)
gonna bring out a Bento Box for everyone (46:09 - 46:13)
so you guys can have lunch here and I (46:11 - 46:16)
was like oh I don't like when they do (46:13 - 46:17)
this because if I don't get to pick (46:16 - 46:20)
what's coming out I'm oh boy this is (46:17 - 46:23)
this is not good hamburger bento box and (46:20 - 46:26)
then they they did the unthinkable (46:23 - 46:28)
one of the guys at the Pokemon company (46:26 - 46:31)
uh who was like uh also like the (46:28 - 46:34)
translator so he flew in Japanese he he (46:31 - 46:36)
was the one that set up the ceremonial (46:34 - 46:40)
tea thing and he was like the the Bento (46:36 - 46:42)
boxes that are coming out are from the (46:40 - 46:45)
oldest restaurant in Yokohama they've (46:42 - 46:48)
been around for like 400 years and then (46:45 - 46:49)
he goes on and says (46:48 - 46:52)
it is so hard to get food there I have (46:49 - 46:55)
never eaten this food before so you guys (46:52 - 46:57)
are having this before me and I'm like (46:55 - 46:59)
no don't do this don't like set these (46:57 - 47:02)
expectations and then they bring out (46:59 - 47:05)
this bento box and I they oh I open it (47:02 - 47:06)
and there's just like a whole fish (47:05 - 47:09)
looking at me and there's like all of (47:06 - 47:13)
this very pretty but very fish related (47:09 - 47:16)
food and I was like I can't there's not (47:13 - 47:18)
even like a little piece of steak or (47:16 - 47:21)
like chicken like it's just and I like (47:18 - 47:23)
you hyped it up so much of like people (47:21 - 47:26)
would fall over each other to get food (47:23 - 47:30)
from this restaurant and it's this (47:26 - 47:32)
famous restaurant and I I can't eat any (47:30 - 47:34)
of this now before any listeners like (47:32 - 47:36)
Steve you're just picky no five years (47:34 - 47:39)
ago I went to a seven course Japanese (47:36 - 47:46)
dinner in hakone uh and I knew it was (47:39 - 47:47)
going to be a lot of this stuff like a (47:46 - 47:49)
lot of very fancy food that you don't (47:47 - 47:50)
get to pick right you just again pick (47:49 - 47:51)
your seven course meal that comes out (47:50 - 47:53)
you just what the Chef makes that's and (47:51 - 47:56)
I tried everything even when they (47:53 - 47:57)
brought out a bowl with a fish looking (47:56 - 47:59)
at me I was like you know what I'll try (47:57 - 48:00)
the broth even though that fish is (47:59 - 48:03)
looking at me I'll try the broth I just (48:00 - 48:05)
I tried it all I'm with you on this (48:03 - 48:09)
because I with all the everything I eat (48:05 - 48:13)
so I've eaten escargot I I have a very (48:09 - 48:16)
hard time with fish even the best fish I (48:13 - 48:19)
just have a very hard time with it (48:16 - 48:21)
food is not for everyone (48:19 - 48:24)
all food is not forever yeah all foods (48:21 - 48:25)
are not for everyone that's kind of the (48:24 - 48:27)
main thing here (48:25 - 48:30)
um yeah I mean what if you were vegan (48:27 - 48:33)
they had like (48:30 - 48:35)
a a handful of (48:33 - 48:38)
Bento boxes that were vegan not that you (48:35 - 48:39)
would eat that because you hate (48:38 - 48:43)
vegetables yeah I so they I I did try I (48:39 - 48:45)
try to plumb for the first time I've (48:43 - 48:48)
never had Plum before so the salty ones (48:45 - 48:50)
uh no this one had like a sugar crystal (48:48 - 48:52)
glaze around it it was supposed to be (48:50 - 48:54)
like a dessert plum (48:52 - 48:56)
um that was good and they the people (48:54 - 48:58)
around me warned me that the pit was (48:56 - 49:00)
still in it so don't bite directly into (48:58 - 49:02)
it Plum being one of my favorite fruits (49:00 - 49:06)
I think I eat for dried plums a day when (49:02 - 49:09)
I get the opportunity to (49:06 - 49:11)
but then I I tried a couple other things (49:09 - 49:13)
and I was just like nope this is this is (49:11 - 49:16)
not for me and I I but again I just like (49:13 - 49:19)
feel super bad and of like I feel like (49:16 - 49:22)
you just food waste slash money waste (49:19 - 49:23)
slash (49:22 - 49:25)
yes it was all designed to make you feel (49:23 - 49:29)
guilty they succeeded yes yeah for (49:25 - 49:30)
everyone Japan in a nutshell try to make (49:29 - 49:32)
people feel guilty (49:30 - 49:34)
um but yeah I think uh you know (49:32 - 49:36)
regardless of going to a ceremonial Tea (49:34 - 49:39)
Ceremony ceremonial teaser uh that was (49:36 - 49:42)
backwards uh regardless I think the (49:39 - 49:44)
trailer to (49:42 - 49:49)
show off Poltergeist was really cool (49:44 - 49:52)
absolutely (49:49 - 49:52)
um (49:57 - 50:00)
was there anything else we didn't talk (49:58 - 50:02)
about uh you know all the all the (50:00 - 50:05)
starters are coming back (50:02 - 50:06)
um that they made a big deal about that (50:05 - 50:08)
we didn't really mention that they're (50:06 - 50:10)
not coming back until the second DLC (50:08 - 50:13)
though I'm pretty sure yes I have it (50:10 - 50:15)
right here his first poke first partner (50:13 - 50:17)
Pokemon which I guess is now the (50:15 - 50:20)
official I I guess it's always been the (50:17 - 50:23)
what they've called it but I feel like (50:20 - 50:24)
the first time I heard it was let's go (50:23 - 50:26)
Pikachu let's go Eevee (50:24 - 50:29)
Sarah B said they were using it before (50:26 - 50:32)
that which sure I believe Joe I just (50:29 - 50:33)
don't remember (50:32 - 50:35)
um but I guess the Pokemon company (50:33 - 50:36)
doesn't like the term starter Pokemon (50:35 - 50:39)
they like first partner Pokemon they've (50:36 - 50:42)
got to have their own specific term (50:39 - 50:44)
for anything (50:42 - 50:46)
um they seem to be using a lot in this (50:44 - 50:48)
last like six months (50:46 - 50:50)
um they're saying that first partner (50:48 - 50:51)
Pokemon from past titles and the core (50:50 - 50:53)
Pokemon series I also like using the (50:51 - 50:55)
word core that only using the word main (50:53 - 50:58)
uh core Pokemon series are appearing in (50:55 - 51:00)
Spades in the terrarium house in the (50:58 - 51:03)
blueberry Academy in the second part the (51:00 - 51:06)
Indigo disc the terrarium is a facility (51:03 - 51:09)
that recreates a variety of biomes of (51:06 - 51:11)
course you can battle these Pokemon to (51:09 - 51:13)
add them to your team you'll also be (51:11 - 51:15)
able to thrust lies with them (51:13 - 51:18)
and that's all it says (51:15 - 51:21)
I think a lot of people think that once (51:18 - 51:23)
next week comes you'll be able to add (51:21 - 51:27)
them but I don't think that's the case (51:23 - 51:30)
like there were 100 Pokemon for the (51:27 - 51:31)
first DLC of Isle of armor and there was (51:30 - 51:33)
a hundred Pokemon for the second DLC and (51:31 - 51:36)
even though we knew (51:33 - 51:38)
uh Neato King was coming back in the (51:36 - 51:41)
second DLC we couldn't add him in the (51:38 - 51:43)
first one yeah you're probably gonna (51:41 - 51:45)
have to keep waiting till winter to get (51:43 - 51:47)
your starters back (51:45 - 51:50)
or your first partner Pokemon (51:47 - 51:52)
um I still think they're gonna do seven (51:50 - 51:53)
star raids with them though (51:52 - 51:55)
like we might be able to get like (51:53 - 51:58)
Chikorita early or Mudkip early if they (51:55 - 52:01)
decide to do seven star (51:58 - 52:03)
I don't know what is a seven star (52:01 - 52:06)
Meganium look like I don't know what (52:03 - 52:08)
yeah I mean we don't know where they're (52:06 - 52:10)
going with Reds from here (52:08 - 52:13)
uh yeah yeah I also (52:10 - 52:16)
I also think that Shiny Rayquaza has to (52:13 - 52:19)
be like a future raid more so around the (52:16 - 52:21)
time that (52:19 - 52:24)
uh Horizons comes (52:21 - 52:27)
out which (52:24 - 52:29)
I don't think they announced a date for (52:27 - 52:31)
that yet (52:29 - 52:31)
so uh yeah that's a thing (52:31 - 52:36)
um (52:37 - 52:39)
and then was there anything else from (52:39 - 52:43)
the trailers that we missed there was (52:41 - 52:44)
just so much information that came out I (52:43 - 52:46)
think we're (52:44 - 52:47)
caught up (52:46 - 52:50)
will how do you feel about ogrepon how (52:47 - 52:51)
do you feel about uh uh pheasant Dippity (52:50 - 52:57)
and uh okey-dogy and monkey Dory so I (52:51 - 52:58)
mean (52:57 - 53:03)
once again can we get a new designer (52:58 - 53:03)
what which one is cute I mean sigilif (53:09 - 53:18)
looking one the angry monkey or the big (53:13 - 53:20)
cat that wants to hit me (53:18 - 53:23)
I think they're all great I love all of (53:20 - 53:25)
them a lot (53:23 - 53:27)
that's just not I'm not a huge fan but I (53:25 - 53:29)
think they're gonna have other forms (53:27 - 53:30)
I'll probably like more (53:29 - 53:32)
I also haven't looked at any of the (53:30 - 53:35)
leaks so I have no idea yeah I mean like (53:32 - 53:38)
are they gonna evolve or (53:35 - 53:40)
I mean there's definitely a story there (53:38 - 53:42)
I don't think it's related to the main (53:40 - 53:44)
story that I'm excited about from the (53:42 - 53:46)
rest of the game but there's definitely (53:44 - 53:48)
a story they've got going with ogrepon (53:46 - 53:50)
and all of that I mean I like anything (53:48 - 53:54)
Unova related so iron Crown is is a yes (53:50 - 53:57)
and definitely into it (53:54 - 53:57)
got it so we we just need to wait for (53:57 - 54:01)
the Gen 5 remake and you'll be (53:59 - 54:05)
full steam ahead absolutely (54:01 - 54:05)
for uh if you're watching on YouTube (54:08 - 54:12)
feel free to like comment subscribe (54:10 - 54:14)
here's your call out but also don't (54:12 - 54:15)
spoil (54:14 - 54:17)
leaks in the YouTube comments because I (54:15 - 54:20)
read those and other people read those (54:17 - 54:21)
and (54:20 - 54:24)
I don't wanna like I looked at some of (54:21 - 54:27)
the like I un intentionally just because (54:24 - 54:29)
Twitter likes to give you whatever (54:27 - 54:32)
um I have seen some of them but I'm good (54:29 - 54:34)
I don't need to see the rest I do like (54:32 - 54:36)
to be surprised like the rest of the (54:34 - 54:38)
people out there and (54:36 - 54:41)
so when Hannah says I don't know if they (54:38 - 54:43)
evolve I actually don't know that either (54:41 - 54:46)
so please don't tell us so don't tell us (54:43 - 54:48)
yes is what I'm saying (54:46 - 54:53)
I would still like to be surprised (54:48 - 54:56)
something has to surprise me I mean (54:53 - 54:57)
that's like honestly for me like that's (54:56 - 54:59)
one of the things that most ruins (54:57 - 55:01)
Pokemon games for me is when people are (54:59 - 55:03)
so excited to tell you something that (55:01 - 55:05)
you haven't discovered yet and I'm like (55:03 - 55:06)
well now (55:05 - 55:09)
when I discover it it's not me (55:06 - 55:11)
discovering it because you already did (55:09 - 55:14)
and I'm just too late to the game a lot (55:11 - 55:15)
of people are really good about waiting (55:14 - 55:17)
for everybody to get through the (55:15 - 55:21)
surprise the problem is I know (55:17 - 55:21)
don't look at me you ruined two things (55:22 - 55:28)
in scarlet and violet for me but in like (55:25 - 55:29)
what like 10 years they were probably (55:28 - 55:32)
accidental things (55:29 - 55:35)
and ruined is ruined dude wait what did (55:32 - 55:37)
I ruin I don't remember uh number one (55:35 - 55:39)
you said what's your favorite Pokemon in (55:37 - 55:41)
the game right now and I was like oh (55:39 - 55:43)
brambling I really like bramblin it's (55:41 - 55:45)
really cute and then you're like oh that (55:43 - 55:47)
Mouse Pokemon is really cute too I (55:45 - 55:50)
hadn't come across a mouse Pokemon yet (55:47 - 55:54)
so when I did it talking about Pikachu (55:50 - 55:56)
exactly when you came across it finally (55:54 - 55:59)
and I was like well Steve's already got (55:56 - 56:00)
this one I'm not even gonna catch it (55:59 - 56:02)
because it's it's used and then the (56:00 - 56:05)
worst was also when I was like we were (56:02 - 56:06)
talking and I was like oh I just (56:05 - 56:08)
defeated iron Treads and I was like uh (56:06 - 56:10)
you know I was able to figure it out (56:08 - 56:13)
because it's uh steel rock or steel (56:10 - 56:15)
ground or whatever it is and then you're (56:13 - 56:18)
like oh yeah but you know all the iron (56:15 - 56:21)
Pokemon aren't uh Steel type (56:18 - 56:25)
you don't get those until the very end (56:21 - 56:27)
of the game (56:25 - 56:29)
and so when I finally got there I was (56:27 - 56:30)
like oh well I'm not going to make the (56:29 - 56:32)
mistake of thinking these are Steel type (56:30 - 56:34)
because Steve already ruined that for me (56:32 - 56:36)
at least you made it to the end of the (56:34 - 56:37)
game (56:36 - 56:39)
I always make it to the end of the game (56:37 - 56:42)
at my own pace (56:39 - 56:45)
no no those are story story spoilers (56:42 - 56:49)
that ruined yeah I'm so like I'm pretty (56:45 - 56:50)
sure (56:49 - 56:54)
I was like doesn't matter (56:50 - 56:54)
uh the new Pokemon Go season is called (56:54 - 57:00)
Adventures abound yes uh and it will run (56:57 - 57:05)
from September 1st to December 1st (57:00 - 57:07)
um and uh (57:05 - 57:11)
just like the internet Niantic 2 would (57:07 - 57:13)
like to forget Gallery exists (57:11 - 57:15)
for whatever reason I like Galler I (57:13 - 57:17)
think sword and shield are great (57:15 - 57:20)
we're just skipping them on we're just (57:17 - 57:22)
skipping through and (57:20 - 57:26)
quaxley sprigatito and Fuego will make (57:22 - 57:28)
their debut (57:26 - 57:31)
we always do this Niantic always does (57:28 - 57:33)
this and it's like the same every time (57:31 - 57:35)
they just rush through them (57:33 - 57:38)
except they'll hold out like two (57:35 - 57:41)
like yeah like how long did they held up (57:38 - 57:42)
for Larvesta and then they were like (57:41 - 57:45)
we'll make it a one percent mm-hmm (57:42 - 57:47)
and I'm not sure I would say they're (57:45 - 57:48)
rushing through it they are releasing (57:47 - 57:51)
more Pokemon from this generation than (57:48 - 57:53)
they usually do at the start I actually (57:51 - 57:58)
feels good was getting Galler Pokemon (57:53 - 58:03)
I'm pretty sure two houses ago (57:58 - 58:06)
and yes I've moved twice since I've (58:03 - 58:08)
lived in Minneapolis (58:06 - 58:11)
but it's been about two years per house (58:08 - 58:14)
yeah they released a couple (58:11 - 58:15)
but they haven't released very many (58:14 - 58:18)
since then yeah I mean with Gallery 2 (58:15 - 58:22)
they released a couple and then (58:18 - 58:24)
but they weren't done with alola when (58:22 - 58:26)
they were releasing yeah yeah no they (58:24 - 58:28)
yeah they weren't done with alola but (58:26 - 58:29)
they when they released the Galler (58:28 - 58:32)
Pokemon they did it like so quick (58:29 - 58:35)
and that (58:32 - 58:38)
when like GBL took off and like dub will (58:35 - 58:40)
was like really good people just (58:38 - 58:43)
realized how long it's been since wulu (58:40 - 58:45)
was there so they did (58:43 - 58:47)
again I don't know if this is good or (58:45 - 58:50)
bad they did release them for a while (58:47 - 58:52)
and then just pulled them all from the (58:50 - 58:53)
game and then all of a sudden they like (58:52 - 58:55)
artificially made (58:53 - 58:59)
wulu like super rare and sought after (58:55 - 59:00)
but I think that was because like they (58:59 - 59:02)
updated like doubles move yeah exactly (59:00 - 59:05)
it wasn't a very good PVP Pokemon at (59:02 - 59:06)
first and then one of the moves got (59:05 - 59:08)
better which is the thing if you're (59:06 - 59:11)
trying to maybe hold on to good PVP (59:08 - 59:13)
Pokemon any Pokemon may be good in the (59:11 - 59:16)
future yeah but um (59:13 - 59:19)
they're also doing a new master ball (59:16 - 59:22)
uh uh which is (59:19 - 59:25)
I don't know good but I it's just very (59:22 - 59:27)
you know you played your Pokemon game I (59:25 - 59:29)
mean you can hold more than one people (59:27 - 59:30)
have proved that at this point and that (59:29 - 59:32)
was something we weren't sure about (59:30 - 59:36)
however it's a little tricky to get and (59:32 - 59:40)
there is one particular task that's a (59:36 - 59:41)
little controversial I was just going to (59:40 - 59:43)
say which special research that I'm (59:41 - 59:45)
never going to complete is going to be I (59:43 - 59:48)
let's have timed research for one so (59:45 - 59:50)
yeah you have you have nine you have 90 (59:48 - 59:52)
days well as of this recording you have (59:50 - 59:56)
what 86 days 79 days and two hours okay (59:52 - 59:59)
so 79 days I think I know which one (59:56 - 60:00)
you're talking about Hannah I'm gonna (59:59 - 60:04)
take a guess here it is complete 60 (60:00 - 60:09)
raids yes yep it was that one which is (60:04 - 60:12)
uh if you're listening to this uh you (60:09 - 60:15)
have 79 days left and if you're only a (60:12 - 60:17)
free to play player that is making sure (60:15 - 60:20)
you do one raid a day but you know how (60:17 - 60:24)
convenient for them to do this the week (60:20 - 60:27)
after I just burned every single rage (60:24 - 60:30)
pass that I had saved because some (60:27 - 60:32)
person that I was hanging out with was (60:30 - 60:34)
like I'm obsessively going after (60:32 - 60:36)
rayquazes (60:34 - 60:39)
and goodies I heard that not me (60:36 - 60:42)
you're not talking about me uh you were (60:39 - 60:46)
in the Gumi raid rooms I was in one Gumi (60:42 - 60:50)
raid room let's calm down okay so I (60:46 - 60:52)
think I think asking a player to do 60 (60:50 - 60:54)
raids even though (60:52 - 60:59)
technically it's free in 80 Days is a (60:54 - 61:02)
pretty big ask at the same time a master (60:59 - 61:04)
ball is a pretty (61:02 - 61:08)
unique and rare item (61:04 - 61:10)
so I don't know how I don't know how to (61:08 - 61:11)
feel about it I can see why people are (61:10 - 61:14)
upset but I can also like you don't want (61:11 - 61:17)
to like devalue the master ball I mean (61:14 - 61:19)
yeah you want to make it hard to get but (61:17 - 61:22)
this is a little much I don't know I (61:19 - 61:24)
don't think I'm gonna have trouble with (61:22 - 61:26)
it because even after go Fest I still (61:24 - 61:29)
have 50 Something Free raid passes (61:26 - 61:32)
so I'm not too worried but going out and (61:29 - 61:34)
doing a raid almost every day is a lot (61:32 - 61:36)
especially if you live in a place where (61:34 - 61:39)
you can't do that easily and this is a (61:36 - 61:42)
timed research unless you buy it at the (61:39 - 61:43)
end of the season which they're gonna (61:42 - 61:45)
give you the option to do (61:43 - 61:46)
since if I buy it do I get a third (61:45 - 61:49)
master ball I don't know the answer to (61:46 - 61:50)
that (61:49 - 61:52)
I don't think you can buy it yet I think (61:50 - 61:54)
it's going to be available at the end of (61:52 - 61:56)
the season (61:54 - 61:56)
um another another I think hard task for (61:57 - 62:01)
people would be I think it's hatch 30 (61:59 - 62:04)
eggs yep that's the other one that's not (62:01 - 62:06)
so hard you can hatch net pack a day (62:04 - 62:09)
uh yeah I mean like if you're if you're (62:06 - 62:11)
a mobile person you can definitely hatch (62:09 - 62:13)
an egg a day the the small I guess the (62:11 - 62:15)
small personal problem I would have with (62:13 - 62:17)
it I think other people would agree is (62:15 - 62:19)
like if you're just never buying (62:17 - 62:21)
incubators which I hate buying (62:19 - 62:22)
incubators (62:21 - 62:26)
um and I want to hatch a egg I would (62:22 - 62:28)
prefer to hatch 2ks but sometimes you (62:26 - 62:30)
only have like (62:28 - 62:32)
five and ten and you can't throw eggs (62:30 - 62:34)
away and so (62:32 - 62:36)
like you'll have to like switch to a (62:34 - 62:38)
five and then hope the next stop you (62:36 - 62:40)
spin gives you a two and (62:38 - 62:42)
it helps that that one is only hatch 30 (62:40 - 62:45)
though the win 60 raids just feels like (62:42 - 62:47)
a little bit much (62:45 - 62:50)
I don't think I hatch an egg a day (62:47 - 62:53)
actually like an egg a week (62:50 - 62:55)
fair I work at home (62:53 - 62:57)
yeah yeah (62:55 - 63:00)
those two those are the two that are (62:57 - 63:02)
tricky I've already completed four of (63:00 - 63:05)
the ten almost five of the ten so I (63:02 - 63:06)
think a lot of this is gonna go pretty (63:05 - 63:09)
quickly if you're actively trying to do (63:06 - 63:11)
it but the win 60 raids (63:09 - 63:13)
could cost a lot of money if you get (63:11 - 63:14)
behind (63:13 - 63:16)
not looking forward to that yeah yeah (63:14 - 63:17)
that's another thing is if you don't (63:16 - 63:19)
keep up with it and there's like a week (63:17 - 63:21)
left and it's like 30 raids like you are (63:19 - 63:23)
now in a position where you either just (63:21 - 63:25)
stop caring (63:23 - 63:28)
or you spend money (63:25 - 63:32)
so to also you know I I I've I've said (63:28 - 63:35)
like why does it Niantic line up Pokemon (63:32 - 63:38)
with new video games they are (63:35 - 63:40)
technically lining this up with the DLC (63:38 - 63:43)
so there is like some (63:40 - 63:43)
should count towards this yeah yeah (63:45 - 63:50)
every time you do Mewtwo it sinks back (63:48 - 63:53)
to Pokemon go there we go amazing I (63:50 - 63:55)
actually I will say I do like that this (63:53 - 63:57)
timed research I'm enjoying having (63:55 - 63:59)
something relatively (63:57 - 64:02)
mid-sized to work towards it's not as (63:59 - 64:04)
big as reaching the next level but it's (64:02 - 64:06)
not as small as a field research task so (64:04 - 64:08)
I'm actually enjoying that it's there (64:06 - 64:11)
it's just the win 60 raids is a bit much (64:08 - 64:14)
yeah yeah yeah (64:11 - 64:14)
um I think that's all the Pokemon news (64:15 - 64:20)
for the week (64:17 - 64:20)
um kind of holding our breath till the (64:21 - 64:24)
DLC comes out (64:22 - 64:28)
yeah uh I think we there there if if we (64:24 - 64:30)
want to just Sidetrack real quick (64:28 - 64:32)
there's a bunch of new items on Pokemon (64:30 - 64:34)
Center uh (64:32 - 64:36)
so are there a bunch of new good items (64:34 - 64:38)
or (64:36 - 64:41)
uh you know how they (64:38 - 64:45)
uh went with that craft activewear brand (64:41 - 64:47)
are there more (64:45 - 64:50)
there is more active wear but it's not (64:47 - 64:56)
craft is it less expensive no oh I'm not (64:50 - 64:57)
too happy with the activewear that I (64:56 - 65:00)
have gotten from yeah I got some of the (64:57 - 65:05)
craft stuff too and I didn't love it (65:00 - 65:08)
it was fine (65:05 - 65:11)
it was okay yeah (65:08 - 65:13)
definitely not for the price (65:11 - 65:15)
to be fair I got the um I got Minecraft (65:13 - 65:19)
after afterware for free for (65:15 - 65:24)
something I did with the Pokemon company (65:19 - 65:26)
at one point (65:24 - 65:29)
oh the etbs are back in stock (65:26 - 65:29)
going for now (65:29 - 65:34)
the Pokemon Center ones are 60 because (65:32 - 65:37)
they come with more stuff the the target (65:34 - 65:41)
the ones you get Target should be 50. (65:37 - 65:41)
that's a lot of money (65:42 - 65:47)
yeah this new activewear is barely even (65:44 - 65:50)
activewear I just want to say that it's (65:47 - 65:52)
t-shirts and sweatpants (65:50 - 65:55)
they release some puzzles (65:52 - 65:57)
uh those are the puzzles we saw at NAIC (65:55 - 65:59)
in the case (65:57 - 66:03)
uh those those are out now there's a TCG (65:59 - 66:05)
puzzles (66:03 - 66:07)
yeah like a puzzle you put together yeah (66:05 - 66:10)
traditional puzzle no thank you (66:07 - 66:12)
you're not puzzle you're not puzzle boy (66:10 - 66:15)
nope (66:12 - 66:15)
there's a new glow-in-the-dark Jirachi (66:16 - 66:19)
uh (66:18 - 66:23)
there's the TCG holiday calendar (66:19 - 66:25)
yeah uh I thought there was a Christmas (66:23 - 66:28)
one and a Halloween one but (66:25 - 66:30)
I don't think so the the Christmas one (66:28 - 66:32)
is nice though I got that last year and (66:30 - 66:34)
it's a ton of fun to open up a TCG thing (66:32 - 66:35)
every day (66:34 - 66:37)
I think the Halloween one is just not on (66:35 - 66:38)
Pokemon Center I think it was like (66:37 - 66:41)
GameStop exclusive (66:38 - 66:43)
I mean I'd be into our Halloween Advent (66:41 - 66:46)
calendar well if I if I see it yes I (66:43 - 66:47)
will send it your way (66:46 - 66:50)
how would that work just like 31 little (66:47 - 66:52)
Windows yeah maybe (66:50 - 66:55)
yeah you know getting like Smarties or (66:52 - 66:58)
tootsie rolls or what's the hot can (66:55 - 67:00)
Swedish Fish (66:58 - 67:00)
whatever the hot whatever the hot candy (67:02 - 67:06)
is beyond sour Gummer gummy worms man (67:04 - 67:09)
that's hard to say (67:06 - 67:09)
uh oh uh and also uh we talked about (67:10 - 67:17)
this last week but um the three (67:13 - 67:20)
anniversary characters are now in (67:17 - 67:22)
Pokemon Masters you can pull on them uh (67:20 - 67:25)
there's bonus rewards for logging in all (67:22 - 67:27)
that stuff in Masters (67:25 - 67:29)
oh geez we went the whole episode I (67:27 - 67:31)
completely forgot hey I uh played (67:29 - 67:35)
Detective Pikachu Returns what the new (67:31 - 67:38)
one the new one the Swatch on the switch (67:35 - 67:41)
so I was in Seattle part of the reason I (67:38 - 67:43)
was in Seattle (67:41 - 67:45)
um I can fully talk about it (67:43 - 67:49)
later this week I don't know the Embargo (67:45 - 67:50)
off the top of my head I think it's (67:49 - 67:52)
Thursday (67:50 - 67:53)
um so I cannot tell you if it was good (67:52 - 67:55)
or bad or what I liked or didn't like (67:53 - 67:58)
but once the Embargo lifts I can tell (67:55 - 68:00)
you my thoughts (67:58 - 68:05)
um so stay tuned to that later this week (68:00 - 68:06)
um so if you have something to look (68:05 - 68:09)
forward to and then uh next week is DLC (68:06 - 68:11)
so uh I'll be streaming a lot (68:09 - 68:13)
if you need help with Mewtwo I'll be (68:11 - 68:16)
streaming this week for Mewtwo (68:13 - 68:19)
um so yeah a lot a lot of content for (68:16 - 68:24)
as we lead up to DLC time I don't know (68:19 - 68:26)
if we're doing like a mini series or (68:24 - 68:28)
anything for DLC because that story is (68:26 - 68:30)
usually short and (68:28 - 68:32)
who even knows how it's going to be (68:30 - 68:35)
structured this time around or there's (68:32 - 68:36)
still the question of like (68:35 - 68:39)
if there's trainer battles are they just (68:36 - 68:41)
gonna be like level 60 when we have all (68:39 - 68:44)
level 100 this DLC should be available (68:41 - 68:47)
even if you haven't finished the game so (68:44 - 68:51)
they might scale like Isle of armor dead (68:47 - 68:54)
well yeah which is like (68:51 - 68:56)
if you didn't beat Leon everything was (68:54 - 68:58)
20 if you did beat Leon everything was (68:56 - 69:02)
like 65 I think that's I think yeah (68:58 - 69:07)
yeah I uh I have zero level 100 Pokemon (69:02 - 69:10)
in this game so and you haven't done any (69:07 - 69:12)
raids so you don't have candy either (69:10 - 69:14)
mm-hmm (69:12 - 69:16)
all right I only raise my Pokemon the (69:14 - 69:18)
natural way I've never used a candy (69:16 - 69:22)
while playing the game on hard mode over (69:18 - 69:24)
here (69:22 - 69:27)
