[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 260 first episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host SBJ and with me on this day of lopunny i give you will yay I don't celebrate this particular holiday but for all the folks who do i hope i hope you got lots of chocolate that's what people do right chocolate that's yeah that's what today is just chocolate the day of chocolate and jelly beans and that fake plastic grass and then you like try to grab a handful of jelly beans but then you get like all that grass in your hand and then you still shove it in your mouth and then you have to like pick out the grass with your tongue and stuff yeah right what what are you doing yes go go ahead I can't explain it's not my holiday all right I have like a semi semi good Easter story we also have my co with us today hello that's it that's that's all you guys get all right c is one next to me did you know sighs don't break your basket I celebrate Easter like a true American which is to say I celebrate superficially mmm and I just do the like fun things and that's it if so did you have an easter egg hunt nope did you get an Easter basket kind of i got like a like a bag that's like a basket no it's not so a bag put it had some candy at it my dad we'd had our family of fun things oh those are the fun things of Easter pretty much just food and that's that's like every day every day Micah believe it or not I eat food no but you know you get together with people and you eat food that's it that's like most holidays I think you have special Easter food yeah we usually get ham you're saying like middle school lunches are like Easter cuz people get together at twelve-thirty p.m. and they eat no wonder you know what I mean oh okay the old get together yo gather round because you have to because it's a holiday okay and you just deal with it sure let's deal with today's show oh we got some Pokemon go new some new Pokemon a new Pokemon has been revealed news and then some some sales numbers for Pokemon 4 2016 so that's our news portion then we have our email segment and then we are going to a trap wrap up with our pokemon of the week so that's our show for you guys today Travis is dead no longer here resumes actually I think they have company for the next two or three weeks so they won't be on the show so you're gonna get Micah or possibly maybe even Logan if if we let them out of wherever he where tivity haven't forgot what state Logan lives in South Carolina oh wow arguably not the best Carolina no I there's particularly that great i spent much time in both of them nothing to be too excited shout out to all the listeners in the Carolinas is there a difference between the both of them uh yeah yeah North Carolina's got Duke South Carolina has of each North Carolina has Raleigh which I from what I understand is all that really matters Raleigh rowlett in North Carolina oh no no Mike I know you gotta go to uh dagnabbit there's this let me stop you right there it's unlikely that i'm gonna go to North Carolina anytime soon but I realize I'll take it into consideration so continue there's this one town and I can't remember the name of it starts with an A and it's like got all kinds of microbreweries and it's like that you can have wonderful beer samples all that late I live in Milwaukee yeah isn't a lot you know their beer no I hear ya at the ice PBR man is that a Milwaukee thing I don't even know I it was and that it wasn't and now it is again I think I saw that they just reopened they opened something that looks like maybe a bar / museum to patched inside of an old church and it looks really cool from like a historical point of view but otherwise not real interested in it but if you're in Milwaukee or you're coming to milwaukee and you like paps there you go go check it out you're really sold sold them on coming I got a Easter story that's probably not that good so my parents definitely really enjoyed hiding Easter baskets I don't know if that was a thing in your guys's households of Easter eggs or Easter basket basket so you wake up on Sunday morning then you look for your basket oh heck no no never do that you never okay maybe no no no you got a basket but the eggs were hidden and then you had to go and find the eggs because you colored the eggs a couple days ahead of time no see we we did the color of the eggs and then usually the Saturday the the day before on Saturday you'd go to a park for like an Easter egg hunt and then on Sunday when we wake up it would be the whole like got to go to church but before you go to church you got to find your basket and then you can have the candy after church which was the only thing that made church I ok let me back up here I've only gone to church like maybe 12 times my entire life that I can remember a lot to process here the only Easter that I really remember no I remember two easters one Easter I got space jam on VHS that wow that's a good easter the unforgettable Easter right there space gym on VHS the bed the better easter was the Easter we didn't go to church which was awesome in itself but I couldn't find my basket and everyone else found their basket and my parents depending on like how good they felt that week of the week of easter they would sometimes put something more than candy and eggs in the basket like space jam or other VHS azure toys I think one year we all got Tamagotchis because that was the big thing but I couldn't find my whistle good easter yeah tell me it's just really great memories so I couldn't find my basket couldn't find my basket I'm hiding a how old I'm I am like 10 or 11 between 10 to 12 years old so I'm at the point of crying because I cannot find my basket and everyone else who already found their baskets hours and hours ago finally my dad was like all right you need this is my Steve senior voice or you need a the dogs so we had two big Rottweilers growing up so we had the biggest bag of dog food in the world for these Rottweilers and so I went to go feed the dogs and my Easter basket was in a garbage bag in the bag of dog food which was probably like four to five feet tall that's how big these bags of dog food are and I found it and I was super excited and so I was for the next I don't know we were watching some VHS and I didn't realize that I didn't even care that i didn't get a gift at that point which is the first thing I kind of noticed but my parents hid a copy of the Pokemon Trading Card Game underneath all that grass like the game boy game the game boy game yeah oh the best so I was so devastating I used to smoke eaters I was devastated I couldn't find my basket to being completely satisfied with not getting a gift because now I had the candy to like an hour later after having candy finding out that I had the Pokemon Trading Card Game which is easily one of my favorite game boy games ever that game is Fanta incredible I like the concept of them putting your Easter basket inside of a garbage bag that just seems mean well you don't want the you don't want the candy just like smell like dog food yeah that's true that's true but why would they hide it inside the bag of dog food that's like where nobody's gonna find it then that's why the unit that's such a good hiding spot one year my parents hid somebody's basket in the oven they took out all the racks in the oven and then just put the basket in there which was actually all that was pretty clever yeah I'm very impressed with your only having gone to church 12 times in your entire life do you wanna know for me from when I was about 10 years old since I was in the church choir Easter week for me was singing in church on thursday singing in church on friday singing in church on Saturday night and singing in church on Sunday morning I'm so sorry this is why I reject this holiday completely at this point because it was pretty much just work for me I probably went to church way more but when at the point where my parents had five kids I think the whole like hassle of getting five kids to church and having them quietly for how long is church what 60 minutes to hours that depends depends on who's who's doing it I don't think my parents just wanted to deal with that anymore we ran the gamut of like the best Easter's to like easily the worst easter frog layers that here's to me and Pokemon TCG too I was singing in choir like 40 in a row and on Saturday night here's the real worst Easter and hopefully Micah you can help me I have a hole in my life now because I watched the last time actually tearing up I watched the last episode of one punch man last night and it's like I need I need something to fill that space I'm pretty sure there's more on the way I can't confirm by the way his number here right now I got something that'll fill that void will okay bass jam no just put space jam on repeat yeah we're what I'm making a sequel or did I make a sequel what other movie do you need though besides space jam that's true there's only one thing I hate more than looney tunes and that's Disney so no this Disney didn't make space to him my sweet Jordan was based any more than Looney Tunes is Disney Looney Tunes made space jam yeah and it was good no no space jam was like the birth of furries when Jim was yeah cuz remember Lola bunny they made her look all sexy no that was Roger Rabbit dude all right know that Walt know there was that we need to move away from this conversation I don't remember the name but there was a lady bunny in space jam that was like blow love interest yeah Lola bunny was it yeah I know what I'm talking about this is going great welcome to the slam dive into some pokemon news here first bit of news is there's a new update for Pokemon go the update and added support for traditional Chinese language which is pretty huge and an update to the Pokemon collection screen scroll bar it also includes various bug fixes and minor text fixes that seems strange if they did a whole like chinese language infusion that seems like a major text fix you know what i do i would i would assumed it was already out in china prior to this update I think it was so I'm not sure what that update actually like did it fix didn't make Chinese language better did add the other Chinese isn't there to chinese languages mandarin and yet well not lang hmm yes dialect there's Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Cantonese correct but it's it's more of the the figures that they use for the letters there's like a simplified and then there's the traditional if style it's a dialect too though isn't it well but nope I had a buddy in school I was very close with in college who spoke Mandarin and he said he had a very hard time understanding Cantonese yeah but it's since it's written it's like they use the same ideograms I believe is the word for the words but they just pronounce them differently oh I see they just stink different vocal words onto the same written words it's like how you people up up where you are say like pop and the rest of us say soda listen well we can finally say so go aki death if there's one thing good about Milwaukee but they say soda I think all of Wisconsin yeah but that's why you're gonna go to war with Chicago but like more middle Midwest says pop all of my family in South Dakota says pop if it's not a big city it's usually pop but a new promotional event in Pokemon go the Eggstravaganza is live until april twentieth during this promotion 2k eggs can be obtained that will hatch into a greater variety of Pokemon additionally hatching eggs will earn players more candy than usual for the duration of the event all players will earn twice as much at XP which stacks with lucky eggs such that using one would award four times the regular amount of XP additionally lucky eggs are fifty percent off in the in-game shop even if you missed most of this promotion and you're down with the piggy grinding you might want to pick up some lucky eggs I don't know how like I feel like I don't get lucky eggs anymore or I only got lucky eggs on i leveled up they still appear it stops like they're rare but I think you can still get them from stops hmm yeah I don't know i have a million lucky eggs from the holiday event when i was pumping money into this game yeah I have like I've 0 so but I played up played a little bit I'm supplying Pokemon go pretty much every day what about you Mike I know will doesn't play so not even gonna ask I played yesterday when we went for our walk to the park and I hatched it to keg and I got an abra I don't notice it I'm terrible at this because I I don't notice a lot of the things that I probably should be noticing but what is the the standard candy that you get from an egg like candy and i'm good i think it's three but i don't know either i just had tags and then that makes it I got six candies from it and I wasn't sure if maybe it was because it was a 2k egg from prior to the event it wouldn't it wasn't affected but I don't know I don't know how any of this works is it specifically like eggs that you pick up after the event starts or is it any to kick I think that point and I would assume that as any to k cuz it doesn't say differently because before it would it would stay at that like when they did cleffa and egli buff and stuff they said like old eggs don't do this only new eggs do and here it doesn't say anything that's why I thought maybe but if it's good if if three was the standard prior to the event and six Candis is that's what you're getting because you're getting more candies then I guess it was I don't know I got an abra and I wasn't super excited and that was the only egg i hatched pattern in many 2k eggs I don't know what happened I have a lot of 5k and 10k eggs but nothing NK or the good ones though I know but nothing yet as a hat teams go shiny top of cocoa 3d asses 3ds themes are now available in europe to brand new pokemon base nintendo 3ds themes will be released in europe on april 14th one featuring team skull one features shiny taboo cocoa they will be available for 199 each these themes were previously released in japan and north america so if you missed that announcement last time and you want a team skull or a shiny type of cocoa theme they're already available in America already available in Japan I'm to the point where I I just don't care anymore about these things yeah you just hate the 3ds I do I know you're like I onus which I don't need to look at my 3ds anymore I've mostly written it off too unfortunately there was nothing that they showed at the Nintendo Direct they showed a bunch of 3ds games they showed you know some switch games there's nothing that they showed for the 3ds where I was like well I need to keep my 3ds around the only thing that I was interested in was the Pikmin game which honestly I feel like at this point is a little too late a lot of people really wanted a 3ds Pikmin game for a long time and now it's it's it feels like an afterthought and it feels like they maybe should have just put those resources towards a switch game for me it's it's the whole like I love the Pikmin series a ton one of my favorite but then I think about I don't know why maybe cuz like there was a couple post about this recently but do you do you remember luigi's mansion dark moon on 3ds and how terrible it was compared to the gamecube version yeah and I feel like the Pikmin is going to fall because they were both really good GameCube games and now they moved it to 3ds and I feel like it's not going to be good the only thing I was actually like semi excited for was bye-bye box boy which is the third version of box boy knowing Nintendo that will they'll release Hillary release all those games cuz they release everything cuz it's an attempt that true you want every zelda game we released well we're gonna make a ball wind waker HD Twilight Princess HD Majora's Mask 3ds ocarina of time 3ds they just pokemon heartgold soulsilver ah there's every makeup here's an an insider secret people keep buying them no that's fine hey and they and they will keep buying them have no pride as long as people that buying them nintendo's gonna keep making remakes I just don't care about the 3ds anymore I agree made that abundantly clear give me themes for the switch well we'll you're still just playing monster in her right you're not are you playing anything else on the 3ds Pokemon I'm still working on my pokédex so yeah I play monster hunter and Pokemon what kind of pokédex you working on right now oh my still working on my Lola I am stuck on gabite its list it's killing me its just oh you just can't find a lot of time and they haven't had a lot of free time say that again we just can't find one is that it yeah it's an SOS battle in the desert so it was easily one of the worst experiences in the game I'm working on it just that's that's what I'm sorry I think I literally have maybe like 30 pokemon left to complete my little imp pokedex nice but that's where I'm stuck this is available for all regions mall I'm just gonna I'm not even just take the Pokemon names I'm saying and then add an aight to it Mawile Beedrill adeno medicham are all available in sudden mood with a universal code the i'ts the little mega stones the universal code is intimidate these mega stones will allow mar while Beedrill idina and medicham to mega evolve while mall white and be drawlight were previously available to participants of the 2017 international challenge in February this is currently the only way to obtain auto night and medicham night in Pokemon Sun and Moon no end date for the code has been announced get your for mega stones with intimidate I n t I mid-80s excited sounds like intimidate yeah ah let's talk about the big Moses about abundance I'll talk about the big news here is Marsh shadow officially revealed mar shadow will appear in the 20th movie the the mythical pokemon marsh shadow has officially been revealed immediately after the release of new Japanese trailer for the Pokemon the 20th Pokemon movie that briefly showed Marsh shadow mar shadow was then announced while fans have known about Mars shadow since the launch of Sun and Moon due to data mining this is off Bubba news by the way this is the first time its existence has officially been acknowledged Marsh shadow was the only pokemon in the game data of Pokemon Sun and Moon that has not yet been officially revealed mar shadow is shown you know black cast form as i like to call it but what do you guys think of this adorable well i think you should be calling it a marcia dough because it's obviously a extra crispy burnt marshmallow so pronounced it like marshmallow i feel like this is the one poke my name i've gotten right oh it's marcia dough I don't know that is is okay so it's definitely shadow but is it mar cuz it's referencing like Mars is this battle is that the third it's definitely referencing marshmallow you know what I used to call it Marsha dough why you you'll do it in in six months from now what happened he also sing a marshmallow cuz it's squishy it's a human it's clearly a shadow look at its feet tail backwards it's a it's a marshmallow Pokemon well say the word play it's a marshmallow and it's a shadow marshmallow yes that's our current marshmallow but it's the shadow of burnt marshmallow because you're saying the third version of pokemon sunny mood is pokemon marshmallow I'd be okay with that yeah exactly why does it kind of look like jabon Yin from yokai watch because jabon Yin was a huge success oh maybe not here but was there any references to marshmallows in sun and moon no I wit except for the character that was named him but like mallow right wasn't that oh yeah yeah one of them that's wait who is named mellow mellow oh wait a shallow girl the girl oh yeah the chef we went through a range of emotions just now forget it like his old man what I when I think of mallow I think of the the marshmallow thing from Super Mario RPG I don't know anything about super mario RPG oh yeah the little companion I think he's a cloud maybe the other clubs but I definitely think this is supposed to be a marshmallow I just I get has little flame eyes that's why it's all burned but this is this is like the the Celebi or the Victini of this game right it is the mythical distribution yes if you need to have it that way so what does it do like what loomed Wells it's the gloom dweller Pokemon what does that even mean the wells and that's what I'm saying yes so do i but I don't come hello before I forget by the way this is same this is slightly off topic but I don't want to forget because this is our last bit of news the the Pikachu with the hats that they announced in Japan they actually do go into pokemon bank successfully and keep their hats oh cool nice I didn't want to forget that but back to Marv shadow so the first the first reveal of marsh shadow was in the for the new movie right yeah but I didn't watch that trailer oh you should watch it cuz it's super freaky because like it's like you're like oh it's like the first story of the cartoon with ash it's all like how he meets Pikachu and then all of a sudden these a lowland dude show up and they're like you're like there was no a lola when Ash was just a ten-year-old boy 17 years ago what is all this madness and then marsh shadow shows up or Marsha dough and and you're just it's like an LSD trip more like Marsha don't hey hey I like that one got him I saw this initially during the data mining stuff like pre the game launch and I remember distinctly thinking along with other people that's a marshmallow Pokemon because of its name but now there's no like evidence that it's a marshmallow polka dot Pokemon so I'm kind of second guessing that trust your gut dude I go ahead amar has to do with like Mars your space that's my guess but I'm probably wrong Mars had oh what's a Hado Mart what is it it's well but you're probably right because when you mash two words together I don't know the term for that uh since it's fighting ghosts and Mars is the God of War you're probably right but that just takes all the fun out of it I agree it'll always be a marshmallow Pokemon to us I don't know if your games are called Sun and Moon those are very space heavy and Mars Sun Moon and Pokemon Mars I'm not saying it's poking about Mars but I'm just saying that you already got two things that involve space this Pokemon being from Mars or just a reference to that space wise kind of makes sense disney XD there to the air Pokemon Sun and Moon episodes in the u.s. beginning May thirteenth at nine am-8 p.m. eastern that seems like a typo with sun and moon episode 3 called loading the decks we're finally getting the rest of these semanek sodes on May thirteenth well first one at least well yeah I won't be getting them cuz I don't have cable anymore and my TV is just an empty black I gotta get that PlayStation view do we need to do another commercial for PlayStation view no no that though we need the price for that to go down that's at least 30 books yeah I'm trying to save money that's why I cancelled my cable I mean I'm sure your cable is way more than third dollars to tell you that he got that right speaking of money last bit of news here this 2016 marked the 20th anniversary of Pokemon and what a celebration it was this article's from Nintendo life from two main series Pokemon games on Nintendo 3ds Pokemon Sun and Moon as well as the augmented reality game pokemon go the Pokemon franchise had a good year the pokemon company a joint company of Nintendo Game Freak and creatures created to have a Pokemon licensing has revealed the license it's 2016 retail revenue the pokemon company reportedly brought in 3.3 billion in retail revenue placing 19th in the world this is an increase from 2015 during which the pokemon company only had 2.1 billion in retail and placed 29th in the world Pokemon enjoyed an incredibly strong year at retail 2016 which marked the brand's 20th anniversary the milestone which was recognized by the first introduction of the Pokemon video game 20 years ago catapulted the popularity of the brand into global spotlight and kicked off with the first ever pokemon Super Bowl commercial the company also introduced the poke the mobile game pokemon go which began a global phenomenon and was downloaded more than 650 million times pokemon followed the success with Pokemon Sun and Pokemon moon for the Nintendo 3ds bush became the third best-selling Nintendo 3ds title of all time adding to the 280 million Pokemon video games already sold there's a lot of money 19th in the world it's a lot of money that's a an amazing accomplishment and now look at where we are we're in this Pokemon drought yeah I'm surprised Sun and Moon is the third best-selling title Wow yes the only snuck that little birdie and pronoun get in there six months and the 3ds has been up for what seven years now six years 3ds has been out six yeah I can't tell six or seven something like that yikes still mind-blowing to me after how successful we've talked about this before how successful 2016 was for Pokemon how they have done nothing this year they're gonna shock and amaze us in May ah maybe you think they would maybe be like holding out for a like an e3 announcement that's typically not their thing I'm pretty sure they've never had like Pokemon has never had an e3 announcement right the most is that right maybe they're switching it up switch switch and got enough do you get it I can get it could you explain that to me so there's a season and a switch I mean pokeman go died off like it like all games do it initiate hit it that's not to say Pokemon goes a failure I'm just saying like Pokemon go hit its peak and now it's it's settled down to the current player base I would argue it's far from a failure pub wondering how well it did but when Sun and Moon no one's really talking about anymore people are still playing I mean there are people who are competitive at training for competitive battles but they're not using Sun and Moon right there using home on showdown or something like that but well except for the people who are going to regionals and stuff they're using Sun and Moon yeah for two hours and then you know they're either eliminated or they're they're not my point is I have no hard data on this but I would wager that when another pokemon game is on the horizon it encourages and adds a sense of urgency to people to people to finish the game they're currently playing so for example if they show Pokemon Jupiter and Mars if they show a new pokemon game that would tell people that may be dropped off Oh a new Pokemon games coming out I should probably finish XYZ not Pokemon X Y Z just X Y Z in the game before that game came out there's been countless times where I hear Pokemon fans or I see Pokemon fans talk about how they're currently completing their pokedex or currently doing this or that before a new game comes out and now that we don't have that announcement of new a new game people just kind of fell off I agree i think a big discourage ER for me that word discourage ER why not i think a big discouragement for me was the strange decision to exclude the national dex from the game and just leave it in pokemon bank because I that was something that i would do otherwise like I probably would still be playing and doing national dex stuff in sun and moon if that were a thing but because it's not i finished the lowland dexon that's it there's I don't really need to do anything else I mean besides get pokemon up to level 100 there's yeah but what else what else is there to do yeah it's fine it's like not a complaint I'm just curious of what's going on now we don't even have we don't even have like a spin-off game to look forward to I would guess I would wager that they have something big coming soonish because everything that we're talking about i'm sure they have they have talked about behind the scenes already i am a hundred percent sure that they are aware that nobody is talking about anything really pokemon related right now or doing anything pokemon related and i would guess that's probably because they have something coming I mean I I don't need another Pokemon game this year but I would like to know when one is coming so if they were to say hey we're making Pokemon Saturn and it's coming out in March of next year I'd like okay cool now I have something to look forward to I can expect you know monthly to weekly updates of like what this game is about what's coming even if it's a third version of a game or a sequel like black and white or is there still going to be enough stuff for them to talk about in show in the ten months leading up to that what if they reveal pokey puyo tetris Oh pokemon puzzle league too well I don't know what's puzzling like Tetris I never played that no puzzle league was like I don't I can't remember what the game that's based off of is but puyo puyo is what it is what it is but it's also like dr. robotnik's mean bean machine or kirby's avalanche those are versions of puyo puyo tetris tetris pokemon shuffle is puzzles and dragons which I don't know if there's another name for that but based off the puzzles & Dragons engine just association was the best way to describe it I will say that I I chatted with somebody who may or may not work for Nintendo I pretty much was like hey what's up with Pokemon why haven't we gotten anything like what's going on they told me that Nintendo and tpc I had a ton of promotional material and they were going to push sun and moon really hard after the release and they actually through all of that away because Nintendo 3ds weren't in stock and they had no plans of restocking them and so because you couldn't actually go out and buy a 3ds which is still a problem today by the way they just throw away all the promotional material and stop promoting Sun and Moon that just seems so weird don't do that well I mean what was like five months ago now 3 s's are still not in stock I went to in check accomplishes 3d s isn't the only thing in the world can you find one in the store like if you go on Amazon it's nothing but third-party sellers when I was at target last night that target that I I go to maybe you know once a week because it's on the way home from work they had 2 3 s's in stock they had a just a generic black 3dsxl and they had an animal crossing happy home designer 3d s they've had those what about to ds's know they have never had 22 ds's at that target that I've gone too they've had those 23 ds's at that target it's the target while toasted by the way since probably Christmas I don't I can't remember ever seeing more than 23 ds's I just went to that target last night they sold the happy home designer animal crossing they still have one black 3ds that's it that's all they've ever had in their display case was two and now reach me is that they still had a happy home designer 3ds I'm pretty sure the meijer that we go to like once a week has some mario kart to ds's does it not I don't know let's uh we got that it did but I've also seen some galaxy 3 ds's restock recently but it's not many it's like two or three it's very strange it's like really questionable business practice I don't really get it I think it all makes sense I mean you don't restock 3d asses you take away the nes classic only thing you have left now is the sewage but those are out of stock too yeah well it's like they've made their photos of dollars and they just don't care anymore I don't think it's not we're here we're gonna hear from Nintendo again I don't think it's not caring i think its resources you have people making 3d esas then you don't have those people making switches yeah we had this conversation through text about the NES classic mini that it's you said that you seemed it seemed like it was probably because they were putting that those resources towards switch production which I think makes perfect sense and that would probably be the case with the 3ds too but it's just it just seems odd to like and now after this Nintendo Direct they're promoting new 3ds games but they're not restocking anywhere but those 3s games are either already out in Japan like Monster Hunter stories or they've they've just been in development for several years like I can't imagine Pikmin has hasn't been a year plus at this point yeah but even so I mean if you know that a game is launching here you would think you'd have some sort of restock on the system that requires it do you think anyone who is interested in Pikmin or by x box boy yeah you're right sir hunter story don't ever say three yeah that's a good point but it's still odd it's still an odd thing like it's it's not it's it doesn't make like complete sense to me that they wouldn't restock the system and they're still pushing her software for it it only makes sense to me because they've done it before they did it from the game boy advance to the d/s the Game Boy Advance was still selling pretty well when the original DS came out and they just killed the game boy advance they just stopped sending them to stores hmm you have an incredible memory I don't remember that at all I mean if that's their m.o then that's their m.o but I also feel like they did it with the wii as well where they just stopped sending wees the store so people would just buy we use but that didn't pan out too well for the week the we you at the end of its life time though wasn't it like pretty easy to get like it was pretty well stocked everywhere the week I thought yeah oh yeah they sold like 112 million of them yeah and they just hung out on the shelves that wraps up our news what we'll do is we'll take a quick break and when we

2017 your canines in good condition in 2017 and we are back from our break we've got a couple emails but before we do that we didn't mention we didn't talk about Midwest gaming classic at all that's mostly Micah but I guess we'll if you have any questions for us you know let us know but Mike and I spent some time and Irene and Irene spent some time at the Midwest same classic before I don't know if there's much to say but I do want to thank everyone who came out said hi said they listened to the podcast totally means a lot like the reason i do that convention or do anything is like meet you guys so for everyone who came up said hi said they liked it super fective or mythical or or whatnot like thank you so much means a lot but yeah it was a it was a alright show I mean it is what it is right at this point I think we talked about this a little bit last year but it's a lot of the same Midwest schema classic it's a classic you you get exactly what you expect every year why I don't know didn't you see your room was a little suboptimal this year location I was in the same hallway it was last year and I would argue that the room was the same size as it was last year because literally we were next door to the the room I would say that the the downfall if there was a downfall this year was just the hotel itself and them keeping it clean or like remembering that out to me that hallway got the hallway to our room was not only like full of tables that people moved out of their rooms for more space which I totally get like we did the same thing except mike and i put our tables in like an emergency hallway which probably not that great if there was a fire but it was out of the way and also that more emergency hallway was like 13 feet wide huge but there was a table there last year so i don't feel bad you're already decreasing a 10-foot hallway by putting a two-foot table in it and just leaving it there but it also encouraged people just to leave their trash on the table which is like fine because when you're getting to like seven or eight o'clock and the con is over you would assume or expect the hotel to come through and clean that up but when we got there anymore I'm a little confused because where I come from we put our trash in cans we don't just put it on place it on top of a table you're right keep walking I even bring my own vacuum every year because I vacuum at the end of the night so when people come into my room the next morning it's a clean good feeling room yeah I mean it's a lot of just like common courtesy and being a clean person but I don't know that it was necessarily garbage more as it was like handouts that they got from people that they just were like I'll put it on this table which I guess at that point it's garbage but it's not like it's like a garbage nor there were definitely hit soda oh you're hearing rappers that they were like oh no I dro these candy wrappers on the table instead of in the trash I don't know that like that that part probably annoyed me the most of just like I don't understand how you you know that this con is busy you know that I pretty sure they sold 5,000 tickets alone on Saturday you know you haven't 5,000 people come through the con ends at eight like why why are you not sending hotel staff to go through and like quickly clean up all the hallways nuts that's make it spotless but I have some extra staff there to clean for the next day yeah and just like set up wise I think our room went went fine we didn't I didn't focus on games this year I focused more on artwork Michael made some amazing artwork for the show when we got to our room on Thursday night because we were gonna set up thursday night finish setting up friday and the con is saturday sunday like our room was a complete disaster on thursday night which is okay cool i get you got a lot of rooms to clean con doesn't even start until friday night for VIP members I don't participate in the VIP stuff so the next day at work at 1pm I call and I go hey i'm in room 1 70 can you just send somebody there and like finish cleaning it just needs to be vacuumed and picked up in blah blah and they're like yeah sure mike and i get there at six on friday and the room is still not cleaned so it's just another know it's just like little things like that of I am sure this hotel it's the sheraton Brookfield by the way which is a pretty ok hotel I wouldn't mind staying there just it's fine it's like a standard chariton you would find across the country I'm sure the sheraton wants to keep Midwest game in classic there because of the amount like they sell out all the rooms and I'm sure their bar downstairs does great business and I'm sure that Midwest came in classic you know pays or what does whatever they do their business deals but to like it just seems like this year they weren't prepared for it or or something I don't know yeah I don't know I I mean and we weren't the only room that complained about the room not being cleaned women when they got there there were other people in the surrounding immediate area that said the same exact thing and they had people come and clean the rooms there was also when we went to the desk and ask them to send someone to clean the room there was another guy that came up and was trying really really hard to be polite and say pretty much exactly what we were saying not that we were impolite he just was trying really hard to be polite I just feel like it's outgrowing wish that Sheridan like it's they're really packing it in at this point yeah I'm really trying hard to pack it in and I think that's becoming it laughs but I felt like we've said that for five years now yeah one this year it seems like it's even worse like it's I mean they could do another tent but if you're doing another tent which like that tent is huge it took them it took them two years to get the tent right they finally got the tent right last year they got the tent right and this year was also right they could add another tent but if you're adding another tent you're losing probably you know 300 parking spaces which is why wasn't pouring rain this year right no it was a beautiful weekend so no flooding nothing like that no four heading yeah that was flooding i think was year two of the tenth year one is one like half the tent fell down I don't know if you were there Michael and that happened that was whoo that was something I've been there every year but I don't remember that yeah it was like right when show started on Friday look it was one of it wasn't like a corner of the tent it was but it was a near corner just collapsed and it was like people panicking too because it fell on some vendors so it was people panicking to get the tent back up nagyova second year was when they didn't like sandbag around it and it was pouring rain so like you were walking in like three inches of water uh to explore the vendor hall Britt and then the year after that it was it was fine for the most part except it was really cold in there because it was Wisconsin March blizzard it took them a couple hours to get the heat to work and then once they did it was fine just like it took them a couple hours to get sandbags up and once they did they got the water out and it was fine for the rest of the weekend but boy that 10 problems well this year they had they'd put the tent around uh they must have moved it or something but they put it around uh like a parking sign like a handicapped parking sign it was like right in the middle of the walkway for the vendor hall and they just decided to protect people from bumping into it they would just wrap a bunch of rugs around it and then tape it and it looked terrible oh it was effective I'm sure somebody ran into it prior to that it was super effective there were new vendors in the vendor hall which was it was great to see that the thing I noticed is there was way more pokemon stuff in the vendor hall than past years and I I'd be it has to be because of Pokemon go and Pokemon Sun and Moon there was just like a lot of imported pokemon stuff a lot of people making I don't know what that's called with the beads when you glue the beads together perler beads there was to leave they're actually heated I like melt melt together okay there was to boost dedicated to that and both those those vendors had a bunch of pokemon stuff yeah I mean like it's a cool show a little a little expensive personally I think I think it was what forty dollars on Saturday 20 on Sunday yeah it was like 60 bucks for weekend pass or just 41st and 24 Sunday that's just it still it's a lot I feel like compared to other events that like we compared it to gencon which we go to every year in like a weekend pass for gencon isn't too much more and there's so much more to do and it's for two extra days it's like such a significant price difference it just feels like because it's it's always fine like it's always you get exactly what you're expecting it just feels because it's getting so condensed and nothing is really like nothing too much is really changing it's getting harder I think to justify that price point yeah it's still a if you're into that it's still cool to to check out why I try to do something different every year in the room yeah but I was I was telling you I was like if like you get out of it what you put in like I think the first year we had the pinball machine that I built like that attracted a lot of people because you play the the machine for the first time and then you go tell somebody like oh you got check out this Pokemon room they have this actual working pokemon pinball machine and I was telling mica I was like you know if we put up like a a hundred inch TV and you put you know pokemon red on there that would get people talking like all you need to check out this room look what they have it at blah blah blah and like that the word of mouth itself would bring people to your room but I don't think we had anything that that was that great word of mouth to bring people to but you see that all time at conventions like I remember playing happy salmon for the first time at gencon like I played happy salmon and then I went over to a group like the group that we were with which is what like 15 people and I was like you guys need to play this game and I brought everyone over to happy salmon and I think every single person bought happy salmon at the end of that game not me but you know a mistake now that game is so good that's what I mean you should you should have purchased it because it's incredible it was a mistake not purchasing that game yeah okay but yes you're totally right I think there's still some of that with the pinball machine though that pinball machine is definitely still a draw people still come in and play it for a long period of time or they'll come in with a group and they'll notice it before the rest of their group does and they'll say oh my God look at this pinball machine and the and then they'll spend you know 15 20 minutes playing it yeah I mean it's definitely retained some of its popularity over the years I I will be curious what Midwest gaming's plans are for next year whether that's the same hotel there's something different or I don't know I just feel like they have to do something different and so it's all these vendors and and people who make the show what it is like kind of waiting to see what they decide on yeah I I kind of hope that they move it to someplace bigger ah let's dive into some emails if you have any emails wait that doesn't make any sense if you have any questions comments or concerns you can email me at SB j at pkmn cast calm or you can go over to Pokemon podcast calm and hit that that contact button they'll go to the same place so this is from Nicole from New York City they write in and say hi there i'm a new fan to the podcast and I might must say that you guys do an awesome job very professional high quality and have interesting discussions I love listening on my very long commutes to work so thank you for the quality entertainment have a question do you have a custom website that was built for you or do you host the site ie wicks podbean etc i ask because i have a small podcast myself and I was exploring different options when I found your page and fell in love your site is amazing i would like to see similar templates to this thanks again for hot working hard and bringing us listeners quality podcasting smiley face will and i use the same hosting sites so will can answer well we use Squarespace not a sponsor um not with that i did why not we Squarespace was a sponsor for a while build build a beautiful yeah yeah we Squarespace gave me like a year free or something at one point wow I haven't got nothing free but that was such a long time ago yeah very lot of them my podcast website is not that feel that we were really trying to get it together for season two and it's not there yet but we also had that foray into wordpress for like six months how long do we try that where you gave up by wordpress career space so my ways we had tips here tips from chips from the internet just build an angel fire website put a lot of animated gifts on it now geo cities don't do angel fire come on okay either or really I mean but if you want to be a true business business person about it get an angel fire site just put your images on it bells it beautiful will do you like Squarespace I like Squarespace just because it's really easy for anybody you know to use and yet you can still put in your own customizations everything and it never goes down right it's like impossible to bring a square space site down so when I put my mission critical cardfight vanguard card postings up that the Internet can never be it it'll they'll always be there no matter what happens I don't know I feel like swears bezels gun down before but not that I reckon that not that I can recall but yeah poke my podcast uses Squarespace it's fine I mean if it holds the podcast episodes they're not hosted on Squarespace their hosted elsewhere but at me the site and i think the for the podcast existing yeah the three expenses that i have our square space hosting a sound cloud right soundcloud that's I don't ever look at the name of it yes I'm fight soundcloud for the audio files and then i do google domain registration yeah and then you can buy a chili and other things that may or may not help your podcast and get an angel fire suit and build a beautiful all right Matthew writes in they say so high i've been listening for a while now i am 32 year i am a 32 year old army veteran with PTSD when i got out of service i tried working again in the hospital but realize suicidal ideations were haunting me every day I picked up listening to your podcast which was the only thing at work that distracted me from the terrible thoughts creeping in the back of my mind every single day thank you for the great content funny and engaging conversations and your liberal attitude towards all walks of life you continue to help me through my very dark places one thing I've never heard from you guys discuss granted I've missed a few episodes here and there is Pokemon Conquest the game I considered to be the best spin-off there is the first time i played it I hated it it wasn't long before I was completely hooked I feel the Pokemon spin-off games popularity is inversely proportional to their quality super mystery dungeon is the most popular but also terrible pokemon ranger is pretty solid especially shadows of Almia but pokemon conquest needs a gen 7 sequel but it's not like no one has ever played the game i was wondering if you had any thoughts on conquest at all if you've played it if you liked it why or why not love the show thank you for everything Viva Grand Rapids Matt wow that's a lot to fit in there yeah well first off glad that we were able to help with the with the first part of the email I'm not sure exactly what to say but I know I'm only be squad but keep keep on keeping on yeah I have a a PTSD diagnosis and I'm glad that I'm able to help somebody out hopefully by just making some jokes and laughs to get them through those difficult times yeah that's awesome what Micah said keep on keeping on and if you if you or anyone wants to reach out feel free to shoot shoot an email let's talk about the conquest stuff though I've only played two to three hours of it and it was it was fine I liked it but I like most games I don't get around to it was just a bad timing when it came out but I curious if you guys played it oh I never touched it no it was not my kind of game mm-hmm I touched it let me rephrase that i played it when it came out and i really really wanted to like it because it was pokemon but i'm really not that's not my genre it's it's never been my genre and i can't like get myself to really truly enjoy it it's just I don't know what it is it's it's just lost on me it's the same thing with like fire emblem I really really want to love it because everybody raves about how great it is and how great the characters are and everything and I spend maybe like five hours in it and then I just can't I can't do it I lose interest so fast but if I had to play one of those types of games those real time strategy whatever's it would probably be that one because of Pokemon yeah I don't think Travis played it either if they did they weren't very vocal about it I really liked the the concept of like pairing different I don't know what the term was for that for that specific game I don't know factions or dynasties or something i like the idea that they were pairing like figureheads from those factions with pokemon that were very similar in appearance and like color scheme and all that like it fit really well um and from what I understand they're all characters like actual characters from what was the the crossover game notin Nobunaga's ambition I think yeah I believe that's that's the title correct it was somebody's ambition I knew that much somebody's ambitious Webber's ambition it was they did a good job pairing pokemon with the figureheads because they they feel like they fit yeah but other than that it it was I couldn't do it for too long I feel like it's also not my type of game like I kind of got into fire emblem II heroes is that what the mobile game is called and I liked it for what it was but that was such a shorter / more puzzle eversion of the long form fire emblem I don't know if they made another conquest game where they re-released conquest or something of the sort I would absolutely go back to it or give it another try but I feel like it just doesn't fit what kind of games I like I mean I don't like anything so that makes sense but uh but why it writes in from yamhill Oregon what what a location are there lots of yams up there yeah up on the hill a hail dedicated to the yams hey guys it's my first time riding in and i have to say steve is my favorite person to listen to every week i do you have three questions for all of you guys is anyone going to pax west this year question number two is how's everyone's day going and final question if you could only pick one jenn for pokemon game to play for the rest of your life what would it be mine would be Jen for because it was the first game I actually understood out while playing and wasn't always hitting a to keep battling so let's start with question 1 I will probably be going to pax west this year I have not I don't think they've opened up panel registration yet based off of filling the room for pax east I would assume that they would be okay with me coming back uh I guess the question is is will going to pax west this year I haven't been invited Wow got him all right over the question too ah whoa seriously though would you go to Seattle oh yeah hi I've never been i'd i would love to see the birthplace and dying point of grunge wow this and the Space Needle Space Needle school are you about to argue that grunge is still alive in our hearts with still alive okay because you know i was in college when that was happening so that's a had meaning for me Wow yeesh I I invited Michael ester and he turned it down so no invite this year for you wow thanks lots of wows going around on this then now mike wants I mean that's cool can I say maybe like live is it I'm like on the podcast yeah maybe yeah there's so many trips this year yeah there's a lot of trips this year Becky and I are supposed to go to Toronto and there's Gen Con and there's other stuff that I don't know I don't know there's other things there's a lot of trips this year Black Caps is here ah I would love to at some point go to pax West it has been a goal for a while so maybe ah question two is how's everyone's day I feel like we talked about that earlier but so you know so far so good I cooked a lot today I cooked a lot of food a cleaned my basement today and it's not even close to being dug I still need to find a replacement for one punch man space jam we already talked about that just another season of attack on titan coming out I guess okay these things are in the future I need the now just play persona 5 that's an anime thing just follow sailor be on Twitter and look at her recommendations because they're all pretty good you can put persona 5 in like super easy mode and then you're getting nothing but story and very little challenged to a game yeah I her Sona for was in my PS Vita that I lost in Boston shout out to anybody in Boston who finds my PS Vita please let me know if you have it so since I can have never never be able to finish my playthrough a persona 4 i'm not going to touch personify but they're like different characters does it's a whole different game now nevermind up dub dub all right cursed it's a cursed game is what it is I see well I mean duh there's like wow things in it what they're called personas I was like what are the call things in it persona final question which literally would title which generation would you pick to play for the rest of your life in jan 5 of course oh boy yeah welcome to boring ville the only having a hundred and fifty Pokemon roasted except that gen 5 also includes black and white too so I don't know about that I support like I guess that's fair like if I would if I would have said if I was to say Harkle if I was to say gold and silver does that automatically include crystal that I would not a gen that's titles crystals gold or silver or heartgold or soulsilver I don't care if I get only one of them it's gonna be heart gold or soul silver yeah that's that would be my pick too there's just so much a content I was gonna say replay value but that's not totally sure there's a lot of content there and a good content I would pick Jets map it's not boring content I will do will do one more email this one is from Simon location is 28 canoe I don't know what that means oh they say hi spj and other people on I just want to tell you how much I enjoy the show and it is the best that I've seen best out of 10 others that I've seen I'm assuming they have listened to 10 other Pokemon podcast one question what is your preferred pokeball choice keep up the great work Simon mmm dusk ball for me the dusk ball it that's a really nice shredder that's not a serially good choice I used to be all about the premier ball but I've moved on you've moved on hold on this news because as of mid west gaming classic you were giving someone a lecture on how you always go with premier balls yes but I never elaborated that I've since switched from premier balls I switched like halfway through sudden moon to what the luxury bow oh wow all right someone's too fancy for premier balls now huh the legs your balls are really great the golden black look real good together I do like the look but it's not gonna be catching that many pokemons it's true I'm with will on this one I really like dusk ball and I really like the feeling of quick balling something right out of the gate I hate the quick lock it works I caught my soul gilio with a quick ball liquid such a cop-out set that's fine now cuz it smells like it's a real victory the quick balls like blue and like a yellow like oh it's ugly it looks like the x-men the original uniform yeah it's definitely ugly so for me I feel like Pikachu or electro fire or I'm just naming electric pokemon fossils noticeable yeah what's gonna look best in the luxury balls that way no they look best in like they look best in a quick ball oh cuz its got like a lightning bolt on it right I would never attach a geodude in a quick ball because that doesn't look good but would you catch like a really colorful pokemon with a luxury ball because the luxury ball is like really pretty bland looking well that's why it works for pretty much every Pokemon it has all that's why premier ball where every Pokemon cuz it's white and red and the lottery balls black and gold see that is a little bit more I I group cuz it's like it's blank it's like as a blank ball but the luxury ball is like it's got a color scheme I wouldn't catch a machamp in a net ball that just doesn't look right it doesn't look good you're right now you got to catch him a champ in a master ball because it has an M on the outside like Machamp that's yeah you're not wrong that I can buy that I also don't like using great balls or alter balls because I feel like I don't know why they just bothered me it's just it's it's that mindset of like it's that mindset of oh you only had a great bowler you only had an ultra ball so you just used it and got it and now if I breed that pokémon all its babies are going to be in great balls and then somebody's going to question why is it why is it not in an Ultra Ball why is it why is it in a great ball and then you catch something in an ultra ball and then people question of why it's not as asking these questions as the the personas in my mind the the ultra ball the the great ball or two bush league for luxury ball Steve over here I mean ever gonna go all out call out don't don't you go honey really with a great ball not even the premier ball is good enough these days now the real I got a three ball Steve I'll still use the premier ball I'm just I'm just not a fan of great balls or ultra balls I guess that that's what I'm saying who's saying that the great ball is their favorite ball no one's gonna say that it's not like poke balls actually sound like your catch rates actually matter none of it matters none of this man you know many ultra balls I threw at a taboo Finney and it didn't matter 1hp well that's sleep that's for legendary 20 ultra balls later still not caught I hate I hate everything about pokeballs they just don't work we're talking to the guy who uses master ball in a cold ugh yeah I did it right I did it right was no regrets no regrets have you have any emails why why do I keep doing this we have any questions comments concerns in email form you can send those the SBJ at peak am and cast calm tell me biomol your favorite balls pokey or basket yet you could also send snail mail a jim was that a space jam joke i tie everything together welcome to the slam I have a peel back so I haven't checked in a while I'll check it this week but yeah you can send me snail mail if you want it's on Pokemon podcast comments on the patreon page there's a p.o box there somewhere wrap things up here with Pokemon of the week no Travis with us but we don't need Travis because we have our slack community poem out of the week this week is muck lowland muck to be exact best muck want to give a shout out to our slack community they pretty much came to an agreement here with muck I'm just going to read what we have so for muck a lowland you want to put you want to give it a figgy Barry you want the ability gluttony and you want to put your Eevee's into they spelled it out right here for a little 50 188 HP 244 attack 44 defense 20 special defense 12-speed add nature with the moves poison jab knock off curse and protect gluttony makes it eat the fig Barry earlier we're using this in double battles as all our poke one of the weeks are that EV spread will allow it to KO top of cocoa with poison jab knock off is ridiculously strong against item dependent Pokemon mainly porygon to slack community agrees that a lowland muck destroys porygon to with that EV spread it will also survived a hydro vortex from gyarados and eruption from full health special torkoal ninety-three percent of the time is very exact it will also survive in a lowland marowak bonemerang all the time if you want to pair it like a fine wine you want to pay or a lowland muck with taboo fini it will not get burned under tapu Finney's terrain and cart ana is also a good team member because it threatens all hard counters for muck like Garchomp there you go a little bit shorter than Travis's version but extra has get yourself a get yourself in a low in muck with poison jab knock off curse and protect and pair it with the top of any and a katana is zach's a car Tama katama car Tana like the sword lick from halo oh boy that's Cortana like the lady like a katana is a samurai sword so I guess but if you had a cart full of katanas it's a it's a car Tana some trivia let me get this shiny out of the way here I actually don't know what shiny LOL and muck looks like a shiny muck is green and stuff purple more like not darker than Nickelodeon slime but no one that's not hard to do I don't know what the the the rainbow turns into when it's shiny but I got some trivia for you although mux body is very poisonous it doesn't seem to harm ash when other mux are hugging them this is probably because it's able to control whether it gives off poison or not similar to how ponyta can choose whether or not to burn a person that it touches croagunk is another pokemon which is able to control the amount of poison it uses via its fingertips when using poison jab or Sharpedo activating its ability rough skin what a what a trivia muck shares similar traits to wheezing and gar boater all three pokemon are pure poison types with a single pre-revolution roughly have the same base that totals and evolution levels and appear to be based on different kinds of pollution muck being water pollution muck has the highest average performance of every of any fully evolved pokémon alone muck and it's priya Lola and it's a lowland pre evolution were designed by hitoshi Auriga I'll get to that in a second muck is one of two pokemon that have these shortest english names mew being the other 80 she igreja my apologies for butchering that name they designed mega Beedrill a lowland Geodude graveler golem a lowland Grimer and muck pangoro inkay malabar honedge dual blade aegislash tyrant Turan trum Imura auroras grubbin charger bug vika volt minor and dram paw so they started in Gen 6 it seems like shiny little ol and muck is just kind of like rearranging of the colors of the non shiny oh okay that's not that thrilling I think I mean that's what I'm looking at here I have it's in Game two side by side mux 1 well one shiny one not I'm assuming so I have green on the top yellow on the bottom what do you got yeah that's what I'm looking at that's not shiny I got green yellow pink green yellow then the other one is the shiny okay what's the color start the semester like purple yellow blue yellow oh yeah blue the top to the bottom all right there's no blue in the regular one well the tongue is blue but not the not the skin oh you know what it is that I'm looking at I've forgot the animation for muck is it like rotates those colors through it yeah yeah so it's purple pink blue and yellow okay so this is green yellow pink green I mean there's a little bit of blue but it's really tiny my mistake and I forgot that it has that animation this makes heard terrible podcast make sure this is not good trying to describe a boat mod with a rotating color rainbow thank you everyone to slack that contribute
