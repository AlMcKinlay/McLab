them out of wherever he where tivity (3:14 - 3:18)
haven't forgot what state Logan lives in (3:16 - 3:23)
South Carolina oh wow arguably not the (3:18 - 3:25)
best Carolina no I there's particularly (3:23 - 3:29)
that great i spent much time in both of (3:25 - 3:31)
them nothing to be too excited shout out (3:29 - 3:33)
to all the listeners in the Carolinas is (3:31 - 3:35)
there a difference between the both of (3:33 - 3:39)
them uh yeah yeah North Carolina's got (3:35 - 3:44)
Duke South Carolina has of each North (3:39 - 3:46)
Carolina has Raleigh which I from what I (3:44 - 3:48)
understand is all that really matters (3:46 - 3:51)
Raleigh rowlett in North Carolina oh no (3:48 - 3:54)
no Mike I know you gotta go to uh (3:51 - 3:56)
dagnabbit there's this let me stop you (3:54 - 3:58)
right there it's unlikely that i'm gonna (3:56 - 4:01)
go to North Carolina anytime soon but I (3:58 - 4:02)
realize I'll take it into consideration (4:01 - 4:06)
so continue there's this one town and I (4:02 - 4:07)
can't remember the name of it starts (4:06 - 4:10)
with an A and it's like got all kinds of (4:07 - 4:13)
microbreweries and it's like that you (4:10 - 4:17)
can have wonderful beer samples all that (4:13 - 4:19)
late I live in Milwaukee yeah isn't a (4:17 - 4:22)
lot you know their beer no I hear ya at (4:19 - 4:26)
the ice PBR man is that a Milwaukee (4:22 - 4:28)
thing I don't even know I it was and (4:26 - 4:30)
that it wasn't and now it is again I (4:28 - 4:33)
think I saw that they just reopened they (4:30 - 4:35)
opened something that looks like maybe a (4:33 - 4:39)
bar / museum to patched inside of an old (4:35 - 4:41)
church and it looks really cool from (4:39 - 4:43)
like a historical point of view but (4:41 - 4:45)
otherwise not real interested in it but (4:43 - 4:47)
if you're in Milwaukee or you're coming (4:45 - 4:48)
to milwaukee and you (4:47 - 4:51)
like paps there you go go check it out (4:48 - 4:54)
you're really sold sold them on coming I (4:51 - 4:56)
got a Easter story that's probably not (4:54 - 4:59)
that good so my parents definitely (4:56 - 5:02)
really enjoyed hiding Easter baskets I (4:59 - 5:03)
don't know if that was a thing in your (5:02 - 5:06)
guys's households of Easter eggs or (5:03 - 5:08)
Easter basket basket so you wake up on (5:06 - 5:10)
Sunday morning then you look for your (5:08 - 5:14)
basket oh heck no no never do that you (5:10 - 5:16)
never okay maybe no no no you got a (5:14 - 5:19)
basket but the eggs were hidden and then (5:16 - 5:20)
you had to go and find the eggs because (5:19 - 5:22)
you colored the eggs a couple days ahead (5:20 - 5:25)
of time no see we we did the color of (5:22 - 5:28)
the eggs and then usually the Saturday (5:25 - 5:31)
the the day before on Saturday you'd go (5:28 - 5:32)
to a park for like an Easter egg hunt (5:31 - 5:35)
and then on Sunday when we wake up it (5:32 - 5:37)
would be the whole like got to go to (5:35 - 5:38)
church but before you go to church you (5:37 - 5:40)
got to find your basket and then you can (5:38 - 5:43)
have the candy after church which was (5:40 - 5:45)
the only thing that made church I ok let (5:43 - 5:47)
me back up here I've only gone to church (5:45 - 5:50)
like maybe 12 times my entire life that (5:47 - 5:53)
I can remember a lot to process here the (5:50 - 5:55)
only Easter that I really remember no I (5:53 - 5:57)
remember two easters one Easter I got (5:55 - 6:00)
space jam on VHS that wow that's a good (5:57 - 6:02)
easter the unforgettable Easter right (6:00 - 6:06)
there space gym on VHS the bed the (6:02 - 6:09)
better easter was the Easter we didn't (6:06 - 6:11)
go to church which was awesome in itself (6:09 - 6:13)
but I couldn't find my basket and (6:11 - 6:16)
everyone else found their basket and my (6:13 - 6:19)
parents depending on like how good they (6:16 - 6:21)
felt that week of the week of easter (6:19 - 6:23)
they would sometimes put something more (6:21 - 6:26)
than candy and eggs in the basket like (6:23 - 6:30)
space jam or other VHS azure toys I (6:26 - 6:32)
think one year we all got Tamagotchis (6:30 - 6:34)
because that was the big thing but I (6:32 - 6:35)
couldn't find my whistle good easter (6:34 - 6:37)
yeah tell me it's just really great (6:35 - 6:39)
memories so I couldn't find my basket (6:37 - 6:42)
couldn't find my basket I'm hiding a how (6:39 - 6:45)
old I'm I am like 10 or 11 between 10 to (6:42 - 6:47)
12 years old so I'm at the point of (6:45 - 6:50)
crying because I cannot find my basket (6:47 - 6:52)
and everyone else who already found (6:50 - 6:54)
their baskets hours and hours ago (6:52 - 6:57)
finally my dad was like all right you (6:54 - 7:00)
need this is my Steve senior voice or (6:57 - 7:01)
you need a (7:00 - 7:04)
the dogs so we had two big Rottweilers (7:01 - 7:07)
growing up so we had the biggest bag of (7:04 - 7:09)
dog food in the world for these (7:07 - 7:11)
Rottweilers and so I went to go feed the (7:09 - 7:13)
dogs and my Easter basket was in a (7:11 - 7:18)
garbage bag in the bag of dog food which (7:13 - 7:20)
was probably like four to five feet tall (7:18 - 7:21)
that's how big these bags of dog food (7:20 - 7:23)
are and I found it and I was super (7:21 - 7:26)
excited and so I was for the next I (7:23 - 7:27)
don't know we were watching some VHS and (7:26 - 7:31)
I didn't realize that I didn't even care (7:27 - 7:32)
that i didn't get a gift at that point (7:31 - 7:34)
which is the first thing I kind of (7:32 - 7:38)
noticed but my parents hid a copy of the (7:34 - 7:40)
Pokemon Trading Card Game underneath all (7:38 - 7:43)
that grass like the game boy game the (7:40 - 7:47)
game boy game yeah oh the best so I was (7:43 - 7:50)
so devastating I used to smoke eaters I (7:47 - 7:52)
was devastated I couldn't find my basket (7:50 - 7:54)
to being completely satisfied with not (7:52 - 7:55)
getting a gift because now I had the (7:54 - 7:58)
candy to like an hour later after having (7:55 - 8:01)
candy finding out that I had the Pokemon (7:58 - 8:04)
Trading Card Game which is easily one of (8:01 - 8:06)
my favorite game boy games ever that (8:04 - 8:08)
game is Fanta incredible I like the (8:06 - 8:10)
concept of them putting your Easter (8:08 - 8:12)
basket inside of a garbage bag that just (8:10 - 8:14)
seems mean well you don't want the you (8:12 - 8:16)
don't want the candy just like smell (8:14 - 8:17)
like dog food yeah that's true that's (8:16 - 8:19)
true but why would they hide it inside (8:17 - 8:21)
the bag of dog food that's like where (8:19 - 8:23)
nobody's gonna find it then that's why (8:21 - 8:25)
the unit that's such a good hiding spot (8:23 - 8:28)
one year my parents hid somebody's (8:25 - 8:31)
basket in the oven they took out all the (8:28 - 8:33)
racks in the oven and then just put the (8:31 - 8:34)
basket in there which was actually all (8:33 - 8:36)
that was pretty clever yeah I'm very (8:34 - 8:38)
impressed with your only having gone to (8:37 - 8:40)
church 12 times in your entire life do (8:38 - 8:42)
you wanna know for me from when I was (8:40 - 8:44)
about 10 years old since I was in the (8:42 - 8:46)
church choir Easter week for me was (8:44 - 8:50)
singing in church on thursday singing in (8:46 - 8:53)
church on friday singing in church on (8:50 - 8:56)
Saturday night and singing in church on (8:53 - 8:58)
Sunday morning I'm so sorry this is why (8:56 - 9:00)
I reject this holiday completely at this (8:58 - 9:02)
point because it was pretty much just (9:00 - 9:05)
work for me I probably went to church (9:02 - 9:08)
way more but when at the point where my (9:05 - 9:11)
parents had five kids I think the whole (9:08 - 9:14)
like hassle of getting five kids to (9:11 - 9:15)
church and having them (9:14 - 9:18)
quietly for how long is church what 60 (9:15 - 9:21)
minutes to hours that depends depends on (9:18 - 9:22)
who's who's doing it I don't think my (9:21 - 9:24)
parents just wanted to deal with that (9:22 - 9:26)
anymore we ran the gamut of like the (9:24 - 9:28)
best Easter's to like easily the worst (9:26 - 9:31)
easter frog layers that here's to me and (9:28 - 9:34)
Pokemon TCG too I was singing in choir (9:31 - 9:37)
like 40 in a row and on Saturday night (9:34 - 9:39)
here's the real worst Easter and (9:37 - 9:41)
hopefully Micah you can help me I have a (9:39 - 9:44)
hole in my life now because I watched (9:41 - 9:46)
the last time actually tearing up I (9:44 - 9:48)
watched the last episode of one punch (9:46 - 9:51)
man last night and it's like I need I (9:48 - 9:54)
need something to fill that space I'm (9:51 - 9:56)
pretty sure there's more on the way I (9:54 - 9:58)
can't confirm by the way his number here (9:56 - 9:59)
right now I got something that'll fill (9:58 - 10:04)
that void will okay bass jam no just put (9:59 - 10:06)
space jam on repeat yeah we're what I'm (10:04 - 10:09)
making a sequel or did I make a sequel (10:06 - 10:11)
what other movie do you need though (10:09 - 10:12)
besides space jam that's true there's (10:11 - 10:14)
only one thing I hate more than looney (10:12 - 10:18)
tunes and that's Disney so no this (10:14 - 10:20)
Disney didn't make space to him my sweet (10:18 - 10:23)
Jordan was based any more than Looney (10:20 - 10:26)
Tunes is Disney Looney Tunes made space (10:23 - 10:30)
jam yeah and it was good no no space jam (10:26 - 10:32)
was like the birth of furries when Jim (10:30 - 10:36)
was yeah cuz remember Lola bunny they (10:32 - 10:38)
made her look all sexy no that was Roger (10:36 - 10:41)
Rabbit dude all right know that Walt (10:38 - 10:43)

space jam that was like blow love (10:48 - 10:53)
interest yeah Lola bunny was it yeah I (10:50 - 10:55)

going great welcome to the slam dive (10:55 - 11:02)
into some pokemon news here first bit of (10:59 - 11:04)
news is there's a new update for Pokemon (11:02 - 11:07)
go the update and added support for (11:04 - 11:09)
traditional Chinese language which is (11:07 - 11:12)
pretty huge and an update to the Pokemon (11:09 - 11:14)
collection screen scroll bar it also (11:12 - 11:17)
includes various bug fixes and minor (11:14 - 11:20)
text fixes that seems strange if they (11:17 - 11:22)
did a whole like chinese language (11:20 - 11:24)
infusion that seems like a major text (11:22 - 11:27)
fix (11:24 - 11:27)
you know what i do i would i would (11:27 - 11:32)
assumed it was already out in china (11:30 - 11:36)
prior to this update I think it was so (11:32 - 11:38)
I'm not sure what that update actually (11:36 - 11:40)
like did it fix didn't make Chinese (11:38 - 11:42)
language better did add the other (11:40 - 11:44)
Chinese isn't there to chinese languages (11:42 - 11:48)
mandarin and yet well not lang hmm yes (11:44 - 11:51)
dialect there's Mandarin Chinese and (11:48 - 11:54)
Cantonese Cantonese correct but it's (11:51 - 11:57)
it's more of the the figures that they (11:54 - 11:59)
use for the letters there's like a (11:57 - 12:01)
simplified and then there's the (11:59 - 12:04)
traditional if style it's a dialect too (12:01 - 12:06)
though isn't it well but nope I had a (12:04 - 12:09)
buddy in school I was very close with in (12:06 - 12:12)
college who spoke Mandarin and he said (12:09 - 12:13)
he had a very hard time understanding (12:12 - 12:16)
Cantonese yeah but it's since it's (12:13 - 12:19)
written it's like they use the same (12:16 - 12:22)
ideograms I believe is the word for the (12:19 - 12:25)
words but they just pronounce them (12:22 - 12:27)
differently oh I see they just stink (12:25 - 12:29)
different vocal words onto the same (12:27 - 12:32)
written words it's like how you people (12:29 - 12:35)
up up where you are say like pop and the (12:32 - 12:38)
rest of us say soda listen well we can (12:35 - 12:40)
finally say so go aki death if there's (12:38 - 12:43)
one thing good about Milwaukee but they (12:40 - 12:45)
say soda I think all of Wisconsin yeah (12:43 - 12:47)
but that's why you're gonna go to war (12:45 - 12:50)
with Chicago but like more middle (12:47 - 12:54)
Midwest says pop all of my family in (12:50 - 12:56)
South Dakota says pop if it's not a big (12:54 - 12:59)
city it's usually pop but a new (12:56 - 13:02)

greater variety of Pokemon additionally (13:12 - 13:16)

much at XP which stacks with lucky eggs (13:21 - 13:28)

times the regular amount of XP (13:28 - 13:31)
additionally lucky eggs are fifty (13:29 - 13:35)
percent off in the in-game shop even if (13:31 - 13:37)
you missed most of this promotion and (13:35 - 13:39)
you're down with the piggy (13:37 - 13:41)
grinding you might want to pick up some (13:39 - 13:44)
lucky eggs I don't know how like I feel (13:41 - 13:46)
like I don't get lucky eggs anymore or I (13:44 - 13:49)
only got lucky eggs on i leveled up they (13:46 - 13:51)
still appear it stops like they're rare (13:49 - 13:52)
but I think you can still get them from (13:51 - 13:55)
stops hmm yeah I don't know i have a (13:52 - 13:57)
million lucky eggs from the holiday (13:55 - 14:00)
event when i was pumping money into this (13:57 - 14:03)
game yeah I have like I've 0 so but I (14:00 - 14:04)
played up played a little bit I'm (14:03 - 14:06)
supplying Pokemon go pretty much every (14:04 - 14:08)
day what about you Mike I know will (14:06 - 14:11)
doesn't play so not even gonna ask I (14:08 - 14:14)
played yesterday when we went for our (14:11 - 14:17)
walk to the park and I hatched it to keg (14:14 - 14:21)
and I got an abra I don't notice it I'm (14:17 - 14:23)
terrible at this because I I don't (14:21 - 14:24)
notice a lot of the things that I (14:23 - 14:26)
probably should be noticing but what is (14:24 - 14:29)
the the standard candy that you get from (14:26 - 14:32)
an egg like candy and i'm good i think (14:29 - 14:34)
it's three but i don't know either i (14:32 - 14:36)
just had tags and then that makes it I (14:34 - 14:38)
got six candies from it and I wasn't (14:36 - 14:41)
sure if maybe it was because it was a 2k (14:38 - 14:44)
egg from prior to the event it wouldn't (14:41 - 14:46)
it wasn't affected but I don't know I (14:44 - 14:48)
don't know how any of this works is it (14:46 - 14:51)
specifically like eggs that you pick up (14:48 - 14:54)
after the event starts or is it any to (14:51 - 14:56)
kick I think that point and I would (14:54 - 14:58)
assume that as any to k cuz it doesn't (14:56 - 15:00)
say differently because before it would (14:58 - 15:03)
it would stay at that like when they did (15:00 - 15:05)
cleffa and egli buff and stuff they said (15:03 - 15:08)
like old eggs don't do this only new (15:05 - 15:11)
eggs do and here it doesn't say anything (15:08 - 15:13)

good if if three was the standard prior (15:13 - 15:18)
to the event and six Candis is that's (15:16 - 15:19)

theme they're already available in (16:06 - 16:11)
America already available in Japan I'm (16:08 - 16:14)
to the point where I I just don't care (16:11 - 16:17)
anymore about these things yeah you just (16:14 - 16:20)
hate the 3ds I do I know you're like I (16:17 - 16:22)
onus which I don't need to look at my (16:20 - 16:25)
3ds anymore I've mostly written it off (16:22 - 16:28)
too unfortunately there was nothing that (16:25 - 16:32)
they showed at the Nintendo Direct they (16:28 - 16:34)
showed a bunch of 3ds games they showed (16:32 - 16:36)
you know some switch games there's (16:34 - 16:38)
nothing that they showed for the 3ds (16:36 - 16:40)
where I was like well I need to keep my (16:38 - 16:42)
3ds around the only thing that I was (16:40 - 16:45)
interested in was the Pikmin game which (16:42 - 16:48)
honestly I feel like at this point is a (16:45 - 16:49)
little too late a lot of people really (16:48 - 16:52)
wanted a 3ds Pikmin game for a long time (16:49 - 16:55)
and now it's it's it feels like an (16:52 - 16:57)
afterthought and it feels like they (16:55 - 16:59)
maybe should have just put those (16:57 - 17:01)
resources towards a switch game for me (16:59 - 17:04)
it's it's the whole like I love the (17:01 - 17:07)
Pikmin series a ton one of my favorite (17:04 - 17:10)
but then I think about I don't know why (17:07 - 17:11)
maybe cuz like there was a couple post (17:10 - 17:13)
about this recently but do you do you (17:11 - 17:16)
remember luigi's mansion dark moon on (17:13 - 17:19)
3ds and how terrible it was compared to (17:16 - 17:21)
the gamecube version yeah and I feel (17:19 - 17:23)
like the Pikmin is going to fall because (17:21 - 17:25)
they were both really good GameCube (17:23 - 17:28)
games and now they moved it to 3ds and I (17:25 - 17:30)
feel like it's not going to be good the (17:28 - 17:33)
only thing I was actually like semi (17:30 - 17:36)
excited for was bye-bye box boy which is (17:33 - 17:39)

officially been revealed immediately (20:16 - 20:20)
after the release of (20:18 - 20:22)
new Japanese trailer for the Pokemon the (20:20 - 20:24)
20th Pokemon movie that briefly showed (20:22 - 20:26)
Marsh shadow mar shadow was then (20:24 - 20:29)
announced while fans have known about (20:26 - 20:31)
Mars shadow since the launch of Sun and (20:29 - 20:33)
Moon due to data mining this is off (20:31 - 20:35)
Bubba news by the way this is the first (20:33 - 20:37)
time its existence has officially been (20:35 - 20:39)
acknowledged Marsh shadow was the only (20:37 - 20:42)
pokemon in the game data of Pokemon Sun (20:39 - 20:44)
and Moon that has not yet been (20:42 - 20:47)
officially revealed mar shadow is shown (20:44 - 20:49)
you know black cast form as i like to (20:47 - 20:52)
call it but what do you guys think of (20:49 - 20:55)
this adorable well i think you should be (20:52 - 20:57)
calling it a marcia dough because it's (20:55 - 21:00)
obviously a extra crispy burnt (20:57 - 21:02)
marshmallow so pronounced it like (21:00 - 21:05)
marshmallow i feel like this is the one (21:02 - 21:10)
poke my name i've gotten right oh it's (21:05 - 21:13)
marcia dough I don't know that is is (21:10 - 21:15)
okay so it's definitely shadow but is it (21:13 - 21:18)
mar cuz it's referencing like Mars is (21:15 - 21:21)
this battle is that the third it's (21:18 - 21:24)
definitely referencing marshmallow you (21:21 - 21:27)
know what I used to call it Marsha dough (21:24 - 21:29)
why you you'll do it in in six months (21:27 - 21:31)
from now what happened he also sing a (21:29 - 21:34)
marshmallow cuz it's squishy it's a (21:31 - 21:37)
human it's clearly a shadow look at its (21:34 - 21:40)
feet tail backwards it's a it's a (21:37 - 21:41)
marshmallow Pokemon well say the word (21:40 - 21:44)
play it's a marshmallow and it's a (21:41 - 21:47)
shadow marshmallow yes that's our (21:44 - 21:50)
current marshmallow but it's the shadow (21:47 - 21:52)
of burnt marshmallow because you're (21:50 - 21:54)
saying the third version of pokemon (21:52 - 21:57)
sunny mood is pokemon marshmallow I'd be (21:54 - 21:59)
okay with that yeah exactly why does it (21:57 - 22:03)
kind of look like jabon Yin from yokai (21:59 - 22:05)
watch because jabon Yin was a huge (22:03 - 22:10)
success oh maybe not here but was there (22:05 - 22:12)
any references to marshmallows in sun (22:10 - 22:14)
and moon no I wit except for the (22:12 - 22:15)
character that was named him but like (22:14 - 22:18)
mallow right wasn't that oh yeah yeah (22:15 - 22:20)
one of them that's wait who is named (22:18 - 22:24)
mellow mellow oh wait a shallow girl the (22:20 - 22:27)
girl oh yeah the chef we went through a (22:24 - 22:30)
range of emotions just now forget it (22:27 - 22:33)
like his old man what I when I think of (22:30 - 22:34)
mallow (22:33 - 22:36)
I think of the the marshmallow thing (22:34 - 22:39)
from Super Mario RPG I don't know (22:36 - 22:41)
anything about super mario RPG oh yeah (22:39 - 22:44)
the little companion I think he's a (22:41 - 22:47)
cloud maybe the other clubs but I (22:44 - 22:49)
definitely think this is supposed to be (22:47 - 22:51)
a marshmallow I just I get has little (22:49 - 22:52)
flame eyes that's why it's all burned (22:51 - 22:55)
but this is this is like the the Celebi (22:52 - 23:00)
or the Victini of this game right it is (22:55 - 23:03)
the mythical distribution yes if you (23:00 - 23:06)
need to have it that way so what does it (23:03 - 23:09)
do like what loomed Wells it's the gloom (23:06 - 23:11)
dweller Pokemon what does that even mean (23:09 - 23:14)
the wells and that's what I'm saying yes (23:11 - 23:17)
so do i but I don't come hello before I (23:14 - 23:19)
forget by the way this is same this is (23:17 - 23:20)
slightly off topic but I don't want to (23:19 - 23:22)
forget because this is our last bit of (23:20 - 23:26)
news the the Pikachu with the hats that (23:22 - 23:29)
they announced in Japan they actually do (23:26 - 23:31)
go into pokemon bank successfully and (23:29 - 23:36)
keep their hats oh cool nice I didn't (23:31 - 23:37)
want to forget that but back to Marv (23:36 - 23:40)
shadow so the first the first reveal of (23:37 - 23:41)
marsh shadow was in the for the new (23:40 - 23:44)
movie right yeah but I didn't watch that (23:41 - 23:46)
trailer oh you should watch it cuz it's (23:44 - 23:48)
super freaky because like it's like (23:46 - 23:51)
you're like oh it's like the first story (23:48 - 23:54)
of the cartoon with ash it's all like (23:51 - 23:56)
how he meets Pikachu and then all of a (23:54 - 23:58)
sudden these a lowland dude show up and (23:56 - 24:00)
they're like you're like there was no a (23:58 - 24:02)
lola when Ash was just a ten-year-old (24:00 - 24:06)
boy 17 years ago what is all this (24:02 - 24:08)
madness and then marsh shadow shows up (24:06 - 24:11)
or Marsha dough and and you're just it's (24:08 - 24:14)
like an LSD trip more like Marsha don't (24:11 - 24:18)
hey hey I like that one got him I saw (24:14 - 24:20)
this initially during the data mining (24:18 - 24:24)
stuff like pre the game launch and I (24:20 - 24:27)
remember distinctly thinking along with (24:24 - 24:28)
other people that's a marshmallow (24:27 - 24:31)
Pokemon because of its name but now (24:28 - 24:34)
there's no like evidence that it's a (24:31 - 24:36)
marshmallow polka dot Pokemon so I'm (24:34 - 24:38)
kind of second guessing that trust your (24:36 - 24:40)
gut dude I go ahead amar has to do with (24:38 - 24:42)
like Mars your space that's my guess but (24:40 - 24:46)
I'm probably wrong Mars had oh what's a (24:42 - 24:49)
Hado Mart what is it it's well but (24:46 - 24:50)
you're probably right because when you (24:49 - 24:52)
mash two words together I don't know the (24:50 - 24:54)
term for that uh since it's fighting (24:52 - 24:57)
ghosts and Mars is the God of War you're (24:54 - 24:59)
probably right but that just takes all (24:57 - 25:01)
the fun out of it I agree it'll always (24:59 - 25:04)
be a marshmallow Pokemon to us I don't (25:01 - 25:06)
know if your games are called Sun and (25:04 - 25:09)
Moon those are very space heavy and Mars (25:06 - 25:12)
Sun Moon and Pokemon Mars I'm not saying (25:09 - 25:14)
it's poking about Mars but I'm just (25:12 - 25:16)
saying that you already got two things (25:14 - 25:19)
that involve space this Pokemon being (25:16 - 25:21)
from Mars or just a reference to that (25:19 - 25:24)
space wise kind of makes sense disney XD (25:21 - 25:27)
there to the air Pokemon Sun and Moon (25:24 - 25:29)
episodes in the u.s. beginning May (25:27 - 25:34)
thirteenth at nine am-8 p.m. eastern (25:29 - 25:38)

finally getting the rest of these (25:41 - 25:44)

need to do another commercial for (25:53 - 25:58)
PlayStation view no no that though we (25:56 - 26:00)
need the price for that to go down (25:58 - 26:03)
that's at least 30 books yeah I'm trying (26:00 - 26:05)
to save money that's why I cancelled my (26:03 - 26:07)
cable I mean I'm sure your cable is way (26:05 - 26:08)
more than third dollars to tell you that (26:07 - 26:12)

bit of news here this 2016 marked the (26:12 - 26:18)
20th anniversary of Pokemon and what a (26:15 - 26:20)

company only had 2.1 billion in retail (26:52 - 26:58)

introduction of the Pokemon video game (27:05 - 27:09)
20 years ago catapulted the popularity (27:07 - 27:12)
of the brand into global spotlight and (27:09 - 27:14)
kicked off with the first ever pokemon (27:12 - 27:16)
Super Bowl commercial the company also (27:14 - 27:18)
introduced the poke the mobile game (27:16 - 27:20)
pokemon go which began a global (27:18 - 27:22)
phenomenon and was downloaded more than (27:20 - 27:26)
650 million times pokemon followed the (27:22 - 27:28)
success with Pokemon Sun and Pokemon (27:26 - 27:30)
moon for the Nintendo 3ds bush became (27:28 - 27:32)
the third best-selling Nintendo 3ds (27:30 - 27:35)
title of all time adding to the 280 (27:32 - 27:38)
million Pokemon video games already sold (27:35 - 27:42)
there's a lot of money 19th in the world (27:38 - 27:46)
it's a lot of money that's a an amazing (27:42 - 27:48)
accomplishment and now look at where we (27:46 - 27:51)
are we're in this Pokemon drought yeah (27:48 - 27:53)
I'm surprised Sun and Moon is the third (27:51 - 27:56)
best-selling title Wow yes the only (27:53 - 27:58)
snuck that little birdie and pronoun get (27:56 - 28:00)
in there six months and the 3ds has been (27:58 - 28:03)
up for what seven years now six years (28:00 - 28:09)
3ds has been out six yeah I can't tell (28:03 - 28:11)
six or seven something like that yikes (28:09 - 28:15)
still mind-blowing to me after how (28:11 - 28:17)
successful we've talked about this (28:15 - 28:20)
before how successful 2016 was for (28:17 - 28:23)
Pokemon how they have done nothing this (28:20 - 28:26)
year they're gonna shock and amaze us in (28:23 - 28:31)
May ah maybe you think they would maybe (28:26 - 28:35)
be like holding out for a like an e3 (28:31 - 28:38)
announcement that's typically not their (28:35 - 28:41)
thing I'm pretty sure they've never had (28:38 - 28:44)
like Pokemon has never had an e3 (28:41 - 28:47)
announcement right the most is that (28:44 - 28:49)
right maybe they're switching it up (28:47 - 28:53)
switch switch and got enough do you get (28:49 - 28:55)
it I can get it could you explain that (28:53 - 29:00)
to me so there's a season and a switch I (28:55 - 29:04)
mean pokeman go died off like it like (29:00 - 29:08)
all games do it initiate hit it that's (29:04 - 29:10)
not to say Pokemon goes a failure I'm (29:08 - 29:12)
just saying like Pokemon go hit its peak (29:10 - 29:16)
and now it's it's settled down to the (29:12 - 29:18)
current player base I would argue it's (29:16 - 29:20)
far from a failure pub wondering how (29:18 - 29:24)
well it did but when Sun and Moon no (29:20 - 29:26)
one's really talking about anymore (29:24 - 29:29)
people are still playing I mean there (29:26 - 29:30)
are people who are competitive at (29:29 - 29:33)
training for competitive battles but (29:30 - 29:34)
they're not using Sun and Moon right (29:33 - 29:36)
there using home on showdown or (29:34 - 29:37)
something like that but well except for (29:36 - 29:39)
the people who are going to regionals (29:37 - 29:40)
and stuff they're using Sun and Moon (29:39 - 29:43)
yeah for two hours and then you know (29:40 - 29:45)
they're either eliminated or they're (29:43 - 29:48)
they're not my point is I have no hard (29:45 - 29:51)
data on this but I would wager that when (29:48 - 29:53)
another pokemon game is on the horizon (29:51 - 29:57)
it encourages and adds a sense of (29:53 - 30:00)
urgency to people to people to finish (29:57 - 30:03)
the game they're currently playing so (30:00 - 30:06)
for example if they show Pokemon Jupiter (30:03 - 30:11)
and Mars if they show a new pokemon game (30:06 - 30:14)
that would tell people that may be (30:11 - 30:17)
dropped off Oh a new Pokemon games (30:14 - 30:20)
coming out I should probably finish XYZ (30:17 - 30:23)
not Pokemon X Y Z just X Y Z in the game (30:20 - 30:26)
before that game came out there's been (30:23 - 30:29)
countless times where I hear Pokemon (30:26 - 30:31)
fans or I see Pokemon fans talk about (30:29 - 30:34)
how they're currently completing their (30:31 - 30:37)
pokedex or currently doing this or that (30:34 - 30:40)
before a new game comes out and now that (30:37 - 30:42)
we don't have that announcement of new a (30:40 - 30:44)
new game people just kind of fell off I (30:42 - 30:48)
agree i think a big discourage ER for me (30:44 - 30:51)
that word discourage ER why not i think (30:48 - 30:54)
a big discouragement for me was the (30:51 - 30:57)
strange decision to exclude the national (30:54 - 30:59)
dex from the game and just leave it in (30:57 - 31:02)
pokemon bank because I that was (30:59 - 31:04)
something that i would do otherwise like (31:02 - 31:06)
I probably would still be playing and (31:04 - 31:08)
doing national dex stuff in sun and moon (31:06 - 31:11)
if that were a thing but because it's (31:08 - 31:13)
not i finished the lowland dexon that's (31:11 - 31:15)
it there's I don't really need to do (31:13 - 31:18)
anything else I mean besides get pokemon (31:15 - 31:19)
up to level 100 (31:18 - 31:21)
there's yeah but what else what else is (31:19 - 31:24)
there to do yeah it's fine it's like not (31:21 - 31:27)
a complaint I'm just curious of what's (31:24 - 31:30)
going on now we don't even have we don't (31:27 - 31:32)
even have like a spin-off game to look (31:30 - 31:35)
forward to I would guess I would wager (31:32 - 31:39)
that they have something big coming (31:35 - 31:42)
soonish because everything that we're (31:39 - 31:44)
talking about i'm sure they have they (31:42 - 31:46)
have talked about behind the scenes (31:44 - 31:50)
already i am a hundred percent sure that (31:46 - 31:52)
they are aware that nobody is talking (31:50 - 31:53)
about anything really pokemon related (31:52 - 31:55)
right now or doing anything pokemon (31:53 - 31:57)
related and i would guess that's (31:55 - 31:58)
probably because they have something (31:57 - 32:01)
coming I mean I I don't need another (31:58 - 32:04)
Pokemon game this year but I would like (32:01 - 32:06)
to know when one is coming so if they (32:04 - 32:09)
were to say hey we're making Pokemon (32:06 - 32:12)
Saturn and it's coming out in March of (32:09 - 32:14)
next year I'd like okay cool now I have (32:12 - 32:16)
something to look forward to I can (32:14 - 32:18)
expect you know monthly to weekly (32:16 - 32:20)
updates of like what this game is about (32:18 - 32:22)
what's coming even if it's a third (32:20 - 32:25)
version of a game or a sequel like black (32:22 - 32:27)
and white or is there still going to be (32:25 - 32:29)
enough stuff for them to talk about in (32:27 - 32:32)
show in the ten months leading up to (32:29 - 32:34)
that what if they reveal pokey puyo (32:32 - 32:39)
tetris Oh pokemon puzzle league too well (32:34 - 32:40)
I don't know what's puzzling like Tetris (32:39 - 32:42)
I never played that no puzzle league was (32:40 - 32:45)
like I don't I can't remember what the (32:42 - 32:48)
game that's based off of is but puyo (32:45 - 32:52)
puyo is what it is what it is but it's (32:48 - 32:54)
also like dr. robotnik's mean bean (32:52 - 32:56)
machine or kirby's avalanche those are (32:54 - 32:58)
versions of puyo puyo tetris tetris (32:56 - 33:03)
pokemon shuffle is puzzles and dragons (32:58 - 33:04)
which I don't know if there's another (33:03 - 33:07)
name for that but based off the puzzles (33:04 - 33:11)
& Dragons engine just association was (33:07 - 33:13)
the best way to describe it I will say (33:11 - 33:18)
that I I chatted with somebody who may (33:13 - 33:21)
or may not work for Nintendo I pretty (33:18 - 33:23)
much was like hey (33:21 - 33:24)
what's up with Pokemon why haven't we (33:23 - 33:26)
gotten anything like what's going on (33:24 - 33:31)
they told me that Nintendo and tpc I had (33:26 - 33:34)
a ton of promotional material and they (33:31 - 33:36)
were going to push sun and moon really (33:34 - 33:39)
hard after the release and they actually (33:36 - 33:41)
through all of that away because (33:39 - 33:44)
Nintendo 3ds weren't in stock and they (33:41 - 33:47)
had no plans of restocking them and so (33:44 - 33:49)
because you couldn't actually go out and (33:47 - 33:51)
buy a 3ds which is still a problem today (33:49 - 33:53)
by the way they just throw away all the (33:51 - 33:55)
promotional material and stop promoting (33:53 - 33:57)
Sun and Moon that just seems so weird (33:55 - 34:02)
don't do that well I mean what was like (33:57 - 34:05)
five months ago now 3 s's are still not (34:02 - 34:08)
in stock I went to in check accomplishes (34:05 - 34:10)
3d s isn't the only thing in the world (34:08 - 34:12)
can you find one in the store like if (34:10 - 34:14)
you go on Amazon it's nothing but (34:12 - 34:16)
third-party sellers when I was at target (34:14 - 34:19)
last night that target that I I go to (34:16 - 34:22)
maybe you know once a week because it's (34:19 - 34:24)
on the way home from work they had 2 3 (34:22 - 34:27)
s's in stock they had a just a generic (34:24 - 34:30)
black 3dsxl and they had an animal (34:27 - 34:32)
crossing happy home designer 3d s (34:30 - 34:35)
they've had those what about to ds's (34:32 - 34:37)
know they have never had 22 ds's at that (34:35 - 34:40)
target that I've gone too they've had (34:37 - 34:43)
those 23 ds's at that target it's the (34:40 - 34:45)
target while toasted by the way since (34:43 - 34:48)
probably Christmas I don't I can't (34:45 - 34:50)
remember ever seeing more than 23 ds's I (34:48 - 34:52)
just went to that target last night they (34:50 - 34:54)
sold the happy home designer animal (34:52 - 34:57)
crossing they still have one black 3ds (34:54 - 34:58)
that's it that's all they've ever had in (34:57 - 35:00)
their display case was two and now reach (34:58 - 35:03)
me is that they still had a happy home (35:00 - 35:06)
designer 3ds I'm pretty sure the meijer (35:03 - 35:09)
that we go to like once a week has some (35:06 - 35:13)
mario kart to ds's does it not I don't (35:09 - 35:16)
know let's uh we got that it did but (35:13 - 35:18)
I've also seen some galaxy 3 ds's (35:16 - 35:21)
restock recently but it's not many it's (35:18 - 35:24)
like two or three it's very strange it's (35:21 - 35:28)
like really questionable business (35:24 - 35:30)
practice I don't really get it I think (35:28 - 35:32)
it all makes sense I mean you don't (35:30 - 35:35)
restock 3d asses you take away the nes (35:32 - 35:36)
classic (35:35 - 35:38)
only thing you have left now is the (35:36 - 35:40)
sewage but those are out of stock too (35:38 - 35:45)
yeah well it's like they've made their (35:40 - 35:47)
photos of dollars and they just don't (35:45 - 35:49)
care anymore I don't think it's not (35:47 - 35:50)
we're here we're gonna hear from (35:49 - 35:52)
Nintendo again I don't think it's not (35:50 - 35:54)
caring i think its resources you have (35:52 - 35:56)
people making 3d esas then you don't (35:54 - 35:59)
have those people making switches yeah (35:56 - 36:01)
we had this conversation through text (35:59 - 36:06)
about the NES classic mini that it's you (36:01 - 36:08)
said that you seemed it seemed like it (36:06 - 36:09)
was probably because they were putting (36:08 - 36:12)
that those resources towards switch (36:09 - 36:14)
production which I think makes perfect (36:12 - 36:17)
sense and that would probably be the (36:14 - 36:20)
case with the 3ds too but it's just it (36:17 - 36:23)
just seems odd to like and now after (36:20 - 36:26)
this Nintendo Direct they're promoting (36:23 - 36:29)
new 3ds games but they're not restocking (36:26 - 36:32)
anywhere but those 3s games are either (36:29 - 36:34)
already out in Japan like Monster Hunter (36:32 - 36:36)
stories or they've they've just been in (36:34 - 36:39)
development for several years like I (36:36 - 36:42)
can't imagine Pikmin has hasn't been a (36:39 - 36:45)
year plus at this point yeah but even so (36:42 - 36:46)
I mean if you know that a game is (36:45 - 36:48)
launching here you would think you'd (36:46 - 36:52)
have some sort of restock on the system (36:48 - 36:55)
that requires it do you think anyone who (36:52 - 36:58)
is interested in Pikmin or by x box boy (36:55 - 37:00)
yeah you're right sir hunter story don't (36:58 - 37:05)
ever say three yeah that's a good point (37:00 - 37:07)
but it's still odd it's still an odd (37:05 - 37:10)
thing like it's it's not it's it doesn't (37:07 - 37:13)
make like complete sense to me that they (37:10 - 37:14)
wouldn't restock the system and they're (37:13 - 37:17)
still pushing her software for it it (37:14 - 37:19)
only makes sense to me because they've (37:17 - 37:21)
done it before they did it from the game (37:19 - 37:24)
boy advance to the d/s the Game Boy (37:21 - 37:26)
Advance was still selling pretty well (37:24 - 37:29)
when the original DS came out and they (37:26 - 37:31)
just killed the game boy advance they (37:29 - 37:33)
just stopped sending them to stores hmm (37:31 - 37:36)
you have an incredible memory I don't (37:33 - 37:39)
remember that at all I mean if that's (37:36 - 37:41)
their m.o then that's their m.o but I (37:39 - 37:43)
also feel like they did it with the wii (37:41 - 37:45)
as well where they just stopped sending (37:43 - 37:47)
wees the store so people would just buy (37:45 - 37:49)
we use but that didn't pan out too well (37:47 - 37:50)
for the week the (37:49 - 37:53)
we you at the end of its life time (37:50 - 37:55)
though wasn't it like pretty easy to get (37:53 - 37:56)
like it was pretty well stocked (37:55 - 37:59)
everywhere the week I thought yeah oh (37:56 - 38:01)
yeah they sold like 112 million of them (37:59 - 38:04)
yeah and they just hung out on the (38:01 - 38:08)
shelves that wraps up our news what (38:04 - 38:10)
we'll do is we'll take a quick break and (38:08 - 38:13)
when we come back we'll tackle a couple (38:10 - 38:16)
emails and then tackle our pokemon of (38:13 - 38:24)
the week so we will be right back keep (38:16 - 38:33)
that dog Queen keep that dog clean keep (38:24 - 38:37)

keep that's about cleaning 17 I keep (38:47 - 38:56)
that dog plane in 2017 your canines (38:50 - 39:00)
in good condition in 2017 and we are (38:56 - 39:03)
back from our break we've got a couple (39:00 - 39:05)
emails but before we do that we didn't (39:03 - 39:07)
mention we didn't talk about Midwest (39:05 - 39:09)
gaming classic at all that's mostly (39:07 - 39:11)
Micah but I guess we'll if you have any (39:09 - 39:14)
questions for us you know let us know (39:11 - 39:17)
but Mike and I spent some time and Irene (39:14 - 39:19)
and Irene spent some time at the Midwest (39:17 - 39:21)
same classic before I don't know if (39:19 - 39:22)
there's much to say but I do want to (39:21 - 39:25)
thank everyone who came out said hi said (39:22 - 39:27)
they listened to the podcast totally (39:25 - 39:30)
means a lot like the reason i do that (39:27 - 39:32)
convention or do anything is like meet (39:30 - 39:35)
you guys so for everyone who came up (39:32 - 39:37)
said hi said they liked it super fective (39:35 - 39:40)
or mythical or or whatnot like thank you (39:37 - 39:43)
so much means a lot but yeah it was a it (39:40 - 39:46)
was a alright show I mean it is what it (39:43 - 39:48)
is right at this point I think we talked (39:46 - 39:49)
about this a little bit last year but (39:48 - 39:53)
it's a lot of the same Midwest schema (39:49 - 39:55)
classic it's a classic you you get (39:53 - 39:59)
exactly what you expect every year why I (39:55 - 40:00)
don't know didn't you see your room was (39:59 - 40:03)
a little suboptimal this year location I (40:00 - 40:06)
was in the same hallway it was last year (40:03 - 40:09)
and I would argue that the room was the (40:06 - 40:11)
same size as it was last year because (40:09 - 40:13)
literally we were next door to the the (40:11 - 40:17)
room I would say that the the downfall (40:13 - 40:19)
if there was a downfall this year was (40:17 - 40:24)
just the hotel itself and them keeping (40:19 - 40:28)
it clean or like remembering that out to (40:24 - 40:31)
me that hallway got the hallway to our (40:28 - 40:34)
room was not only like full of tables (40:31 - 40:37)
that people moved out of their rooms for (40:34 - 40:38)
more space which I totally get like we (40:37 - 40:41)
did the same thing except mike and i put (40:38 - 40:43)
our tables in like an emergency hallway (40:41 - 40:45)
which probably not that great if there (40:43 - 40:48)
was a fire but it was out of the way and (40:45 - 40:50)
also that more emergency hallway was (40:48 - 40:54)
like 13 feet wide huge but there was a (40:50 - 40:56)
table there last year so i don't feel (40:54 - 41:00)
bad you're already decreasing a 10-foot (40:56 - 41:03)
hallway by putting a two-foot table in (41:00 - 41:04)
it and just leaving it there but it also (41:03 - 41:06)
encouraged people just to leave their (41:04 - 41:09)
trash on the table which is like fine (41:06 - 41:10)
because when you're getting to like (41:09 - 41:12)
seven or eight o'clock and the con is (41:10 - 41:16)
over you would assume or expect the (41:12 - 41:17)
hotel to come through and clean that up (41:16 - 41:20)
but when we got there anymore I'm a (41:17 - 41:22)
little confused because where I come (41:20 - 41:24)
from we put our trash in cans we don't (41:22 - 41:25)
just put it on place it on top of a (41:24 - 41:28)
table you're right keep walking I even (41:25 - 41:30)
bring my own vacuum every year because I (41:28 - 41:32)
vacuum at the end of the night so when (41:30 - 41:33)
people come into my room the next (41:32 - 41:36)
morning it's a clean good feeling room (41:33 - 41:38)
yeah I mean it's a lot of just like (41:36 - 41:41)
common courtesy and being a clean person (41:38 - 41:44)
but I don't know that it was necessarily (41:41 - 41:47)
garbage more as it was like handouts (41:44 - 41:49)
that they got from people that they just (41:47 - 41:50)
were like I'll put it on this table (41:49 - 41:53)
which I guess at that point it's garbage (41:50 - 41:55)
but it's not like it's like a garbage (41:53 - 41:57)
nor there were definitely hit soda oh (41:55 - 41:59)
you're hearing rappers that they were (41:57 - 42:02)
like oh no I dro these candy wrappers on (41:59 - 42:04)
the table instead of in the trash I (42:02 - 42:07)
don't know that like that that part (42:04 - 42:08)
probably annoyed me the most of just (42:07 - 42:11)
like I don't understand how you you know (42:08 - 42:14)
that this con is busy you know that I (42:11 - 42:16)
pretty sure they sold 5,000 tickets (42:14 - 42:19)
alone on Saturday you know you haven't (42:16 - 42:21)
5,000 people come through the con ends (42:19 - 42:25)
at eight like why why are you not (42:21 - 42:27)
sending hotel staff to go through and (42:25 - 42:28)
like quickly clean up all the hallways (42:27 - 42:32)
nuts that's make it spotless but I have (42:28 - 42:34)
some extra staff there to clean for the (42:32 - 42:38)
next day yeah and just like set up wise (42:34 - 42:41)
I think our room went went fine we (42:38 - 42:43)
didn't I didn't focus on games this year (42:41 - 42:45)
I focused more on artwork Michael made (42:43 - 42:47)
some amazing artwork for the show when (42:45 - 42:49)
we got to our room on Thursday night (42:47 - 42:51)
because we were gonna set up thursday (42:49 - 42:52)
night finish setting up friday and the (42:51 - 42:55)
con is saturday sunday like our room was (42:52 - 42:57)
a complete disaster on thursday night (42:55 - 42:59)
which is okay cool i get you got a lot (42:57 - 43:02)
of rooms to clean con doesn't even start (42:59 - 43:04)
until friday night for VIP members I (43:02 - 43:06)
don't participate in the VIP stuff so (43:04 - 43:08)
the next day at work at 1pm I call and I (43:06 - 43:11)
go hey i'm in room 1 70 can you just (43:08 - 43:12)
send somebody there and like finish (43:11 - 43:14)
cleaning it just needs to be vacuumed (43:12 - 43:17)
and picked up in blah blah and they're (43:14 - 43:19)
like yeah sure mike and i get there at (43:17 - 43:21)
six on friday and the room is still not (43:19 - 43:23)
cleaned so it's just another know (43:21 - 43:25)
it's just like little things like that (43:23 - 43:29)
of I am sure this hotel it's the (43:25 - 43:30)
sheraton Brookfield by the way which is (43:29 - 43:32)
a pretty ok hotel I wouldn't mind (43:30 - 43:34)
staying there just it's fine it's like a (43:32 - 43:36)
standard chariton you would find across (43:34 - 43:39)
the country I'm sure the sheraton wants (43:36 - 43:41)
to keep Midwest game in classic there (43:39 - 43:42)
because of the amount like they sell out (43:41 - 43:45)
all the rooms and I'm sure their bar (43:42 - 43:47)
downstairs does great business and I'm (43:45 - 43:49)
sure that Midwest came in classic you (43:47 - 43:51)
know pays or what does whatever they do (43:49 - 43:55)
their business deals but to like it just (43:51 - 43:57)
seems like this year they weren't (43:55 - 44:00)
prepared for it or or something I don't (43:57 - 44:03)
know yeah I don't know I I mean and we (44:00 - 44:04)
weren't the only room that complained (44:03 - 44:07)
about the room not being cleaned women (44:04 - 44:08)
when they got there there were other (44:07 - 44:11)
people in the surrounding immediate area (44:08 - 44:14)
that said the same exact thing and they (44:11 - 44:16)
had people come and clean the rooms (44:14 - 44:19)
there was also when we went to the desk (44:16 - 44:20)
and ask them to send someone to clean (44:19 - 44:22)
the room there was another guy that came (44:20 - 44:24)
up and was trying really really hard to (44:22 - 44:27)
be polite and say pretty much exactly (44:24 - 44:28)
what we were saying not that we were (44:27 - 44:32)
impolite he just was trying really hard (44:28 - 44:35)
to be polite I just feel like it's (44:32 - 44:38)
outgrowing wish that Sheridan like it's (44:35 - 44:41)
they're really packing it in at this (44:38 - 44:43)
point yeah I'm really trying hard to (44:41 - 44:46)
pack it in and I think that's becoming (44:43 - 44:48)
it laughs but I felt like we've said (44:46 - 44:51)
that for five years now yeah one this (44:48 - 44:54)
year it seems like it's even worse like (44:51 - 44:57)
it's I mean they could do another tent (44:54 - 45:00)
but if you're doing another tent which (44:57 - 45:02)
like that tent is huge it took them it (45:00 - 45:04)
took them two years to get the tent (45:02 - 45:05)
right they finally got the tent right (45:04 - 45:07)
last year they got the tent right and (45:05 - 45:09)
this year was also right they could add (45:07 - 45:10)
another tent but if you're adding (45:09 - 45:13)
another tent you're losing probably you (45:10 - 45:14)
know (45:13 - 45:17)
300 parking spaces which is why wasn't (45:14 - 45:19)
pouring rain this year right no it was a (45:17 - 45:22)
beautiful weekend so no flooding nothing (45:19 - 45:23)
like that no four heading yeah that was (45:22 - 45:25)
flooding i think was year two of the (45:23 - 45:28)
tenth year one is one like half the tent (45:25 - 45:31)
fell down I don't know if you were there (45:28 - 45:33)
Michael and that happened that was whoo (45:31 - 45:35)
that was something I've been there every (45:33 - 45:37)
year but I don't remember that yeah it (45:35 - 45:39)
was like right when show started on (45:37 - 45:43)
Friday look it was one of it wasn't like (45:39 - 45:45)
a corner of the tent it was but it was a (45:43 - 45:47)
near corner just collapsed and it was (45:45 - 45:49)
like people panicking too because it (45:47 - 45:51)
fell on some vendors so it was people (45:49 - 45:53)
panicking to get the tent back up (45:51 - 45:57)
nagyova second year was when they didn't (45:53 - 45:59)
like sandbag around it and it was (45:57 - 46:02)
pouring rain so like you were walking in (45:59 - 46:06)
like three inches of water uh to explore (46:02 - 46:08)
the vendor hall Britt and then the year (46:06 - 46:11)
after that it was it was fine for the (46:08 - 46:12)
most part except it was really cold in (46:11 - 46:15)
there because it was Wisconsin March (46:12 - 46:18)
blizzard it took them a couple hours to (46:15 - 46:19)
get the heat to work and then once they (46:18 - 46:21)
did it was fine just like it took them a (46:19 - 46:23)
couple hours to get sandbags up and once (46:21 - 46:24)
they did they got the water out and it (46:23 - 46:26)
was fine for the rest of the weekend but (46:24 - 46:30)
boy that 10 problems well this year they (46:26 - 46:33)
had they'd put the tent around uh they (46:30 - 46:34)
must have moved it or something but they (46:33 - 46:38)
put it around uh like a parking sign (46:34 - 46:40)
like a handicapped parking sign it was (46:38 - 46:42)
like right in the middle of the walkway (46:40 - 46:44)
for the vendor hall and they just (46:42 - 46:46)
decided to protect people from bumping (46:44 - 46:48)
into it they would just wrap a bunch of (46:46 - 46:52)
rugs around it and then tape it and it (46:48 - 46:54)
looked terrible (46:52 - 46:56)
oh it was effective I'm sure somebody (46:54 - 46:59)
ran into it prior to that it was super (46:56 - 47:01)
effective there were new vendors in the (46:59 - 47:03)
vendor hall which was it was great to (47:01 - 47:05)
see that the thing I noticed is there (47:03 - 47:07)
was way more pokemon stuff in the vendor (47:05 - 47:12)
hall than past years and I I'd be it has (47:07 - 47:14)
to be because of Pokemon go and Pokemon (47:12 - 47:16)
Sun and Moon there was just like a lot (47:14 - 47:18)
of imported pokemon stuff a lot of (47:16 - 47:19)
people making I don't know what that's (47:18 - 47:21)
called with the beads when you glue the (47:19 - 47:24)
beads together perler beads there was to (47:21 - 47:27)
leave they're actually heated I like (47:24 - 47:30)
melt melt together okay there was to (47:27 - 47:32)
boost dedicated to that and both those (47:30 - 47:34)
those vendors had a bunch of pokemon (47:32 - 47:37)
stuff yeah I mean like it's a cool show (47:34 - 47:40)
a little a little expensive personally I (47:37 - 47:42)
think I think it was what forty dollars (47:40 - 47:45)
on Saturday 20 on Sunday yeah it was (47:42 - 47:48)
like 60 bucks for weekend pass or just (47:45 - 47:51)
41st and 24 Sunday that's just it still (47:48 - 47:54)
it's a lot I feel like compared to other (47:51 - 47:57)
events that like we compared it to (47:54 - 47:59)
gencon which we go to every year in like (47:57 - 48:02)
a weekend pass for gencon isn't too much (47:59 - 48:05)
more and there's so much more to do and (48:02 - 48:08)
it's for two extra days it's like such a (48:05 - 48:11)
significant price difference it just (48:08 - 48:13)
feels like because it's it's always fine (48:11 - 48:16)
like it's always you get exactly what (48:13 - 48:20)
you're expecting it just feels because (48:16 - 48:24)
it's getting so condensed and nothing is (48:20 - 48:27)
really like nothing too much is really (48:24 - 48:29)
changing it's getting harder I think to (48:27 - 48:32)
justify that price point yeah it's still (48:29 - 48:35)
a if you're into that it's still cool to (48:32 - 48:39)
to check out why I try to do something (48:35 - 48:42)
different every year in the room yeah (48:39 - 48:44)
but I was I was telling you I was like (48:42 - 48:47)
if like you get out of it what you put (48:44 - 48:50)
in like I think the first year we had (48:47 - 48:53)
the pinball machine that I built like (48:50 - 48:55)
that attracted a lot of people because (48:53 - 48:56)
you play the the machine for the first (48:55 - 48:58)
time and then you go tell somebody like (48:56 - 49:00)
oh you got check out this Pokemon room (48:58 - 49:02)
they have this actual working pokemon (49:00 - 49:05)
pinball machine and I was telling mica I (49:02 - 49:08)
was like you know if we put up like a (49:05 - 49:11)
a hundred inch TV and you put you know (49:08 - 49:13)
pokemon red on there that would get (49:11 - 49:15)
people talking like all you need to (49:13 - 49:16)
check out this room look what they have (49:15 - 49:19)
it at blah blah blah and like that the (49:16 - 49:22)
word of mouth itself would bring people (49:19 - 49:24)
to your room but I don't think we had (49:22 - 49:26)
anything that that was that great word (49:24 - 49:28)
of mouth to bring people to but you see (49:26 - 49:31)
that all time at conventions like I (49:28 - 49:33)
remember playing happy salmon for the (49:31 - 49:36)
first time at gencon like I played happy (49:33 - 49:38)
salmon and then I went over to a group (49:36 - 49:39)
like the group that we were with which (49:38 - 49:41)
is what like 15 people and I was like (49:39 - 49:43)
you guys need to play this game and I (49:41 - 49:44)
brought everyone over to happy salmon (49:43 - 49:46)
and I think every single person bought (49:44 - 49:48)
happy salmon at the end of that game not (49:46 - 49:51)
me but you know a mistake now that game (49:48 - 49:53)
is so good that's what I mean you should (49:51 - 49:55)
you should have purchased it because (49:53 - 49:57)
it's incredible it was a mistake not (49:55 - 50:01)
purchasing that game yeah okay but yes (49:57 - 50:03)
you're totally right I think there's (50:01 - 50:05)
still some of that with the pinball (50:03 - 50:07)
machine though that pinball machine is (50:05 - 50:09)
definitely still a draw people still (50:07 - 50:11)
come in and play it for a long period of (50:09 - 50:14)
time or they'll come in with a group and (50:11 - 50:16)
they'll notice it before the rest of (50:14 - 50:18)
their group does and they'll say oh my (50:16 - 50:20)
God look at this pinball machine and the (50:18 - 50:22)
and then they'll spend you know 15 20 (50:20 - 50:24)
minutes playing it yeah I mean it's (50:22 - 50:27)
definitely retained some of its (50:24 - 50:30)
popularity over the years I I will be (50:27 - 50:33)
curious what Midwest gaming's plans are (50:30 - 50:34)
for next year whether that's the same (50:33 - 50:36)
hotel there's something different or I (50:34 - 50:38)
don't know I just feel like they have to (50:36 - 50:39)
do something different and so it's all (50:38 - 50:42)
these vendors and and people who make (50:39 - 50:44)
the show what it is like kind of waiting (50:42 - 50:48)
to see what they decide on yeah I I kind (50:44 - 50:51)
of hope that they move it to someplace (50:48 - 50:57)
bigger ah let's dive into some emails if (50:51 - 50:59)

i've been listening for a while now i am (54:23 - 54:28)
32 year i am a 32 year old army veteran (54:25 - 54:31)
with PTSD when i got out of service i (54:28 - 54:33)
tried working again in the hospital but (54:31 - 54:36)
realize suicidal ideations were haunting (54:33 - 54:38)
me every day I picked up listening to (54:36 - 54:40)
your podcast which was the only thing at (54:38 - 54:41)
work that distracted me from the (54:40 - 54:43)
terrible thoughts creeping in the back (54:41 - 54:45)
of my mind every single day thank you (54:43 - 54:47)

to help me through my very dark places (54:52 - 54:56)
one thing I've never heard from you guys (54:54 - 54:58)
discuss granted I've missed a few (54:56 - 54:59)
episodes here and there is Pokemon (54:58 - 55:02)
Conquest the game I considered to be the (54:59 - 55:04)
best spin-off there is the first time i (55:02 - 55:07)
played it I hated it it wasn't long (55:04 - 55:09)
before I was completely hooked I feel (55:07 - 55:12)
the Pokemon spin-off games popularity is (55:09 - 55:14)
inversely proportional to their quality (55:12 - 55:16)
super mystery dungeon is the most (55:14 - 55:19)
popular but also terrible pokemon ranger (55:16 - 55:21)
is pretty solid especially shadows of (55:19 - 55:25)
Almia but pokemon conquest needs a gen 7 (55:21 - 55:28)
sequel but it's not like no one has ever (55:25 - 55:29)
played the game i was wondering if you (55:28 - 55:32)
had any thoughts on conquest at all if (55:29 - 55:34)
you've played it if you liked it why or (55:32 - 55:36)
why not love the show thank you for (55:34 - 55:39)
everything Viva Grand Rapids Matt wow (55:36 - 55:43)

diagnosis and I'm glad that I'm able to (55:59 - 56:03)

conquest stuff though I've only played (56:21 - 56:26)
two to three hours of it and it was it (56:23 - 56:29)
was fine I liked it but I like most (56:26 - 56:31)
games I don't get around to it was just (56:29 - 56:33)
a bad timing when it came out but I (56:31 - 56:36)
curious if you guys played it oh I never (56:33 - 56:38)
touched it no it was not my kind of game (56:36 - 56:42)
mm-hmm I touched it (56:38 - 56:48)
let me rephrase that i played it when it (56:42 - 56:50)
came out and i really really wanted to (56:48 - 56:53)
like it because it was pokemon but i'm (56:50 - 56:56)
really not that's not my genre it's it's (56:53 - 56:59)
never been my genre and i can't like get (56:56 - 57:03)
myself to really truly enjoy it it's (56:59 - 57:05)
just I don't know what it is it's it's (57:03 - 57:07)
just lost on me it's the same thing with (57:05 - 57:10)
like fire emblem I really really want to (57:07 - 57:14)
love it because everybody raves about (57:10 - 57:15)
how great it is and how great the (57:14 - 57:16)
characters are and everything and I (57:15 - 57:21)
spend maybe like five hours in it and (57:16 - 57:24)
then I just can't I can't do it I lose (57:21 - 57:28)
interest so fast but if I had to play (57:24 - 57:33)
one of those types of games those real (57:28 - 57:36)
time strategy whatever's it would (57:33 - 57:38)
probably be that one because of Pokemon (57:36 - 57:42)
yeah I don't think Travis played it (57:38 - 57:45)
either if they did they weren't very (57:42 - 57:50)
vocal about it I really liked the the (57:45 - 57:52)
concept of like pairing (57:50 - 57:55)
different I don't know what the term was (57:52 - 57:58)
for that for that specific game I don't (57:55 - 58:00)
know factions or dynasties or something (57:58 - 58:02)
i like the idea that they were pairing (58:00 - 58:04)
like figureheads from those factions (58:02 - 58:09)
with pokemon that were very similar in (58:04 - 58:12)
appearance and like color scheme and all (58:09 - 58:15)
that like it fit really well um and from (58:12 - 58:17)
what I understand they're all characters (58:15 - 58:20)
like actual characters from what was the (58:17 - 58:23)
the crossover game notin Nobunaga's (58:20 - 58:26)
ambition I think yeah I believe that's (58:23 - 58:27)
that's the title correct it was (58:26 - 58:29)
somebody's ambition I knew that much (58:27 - 58:31)
somebody's ambitious Webber's ambition (58:29 - 58:33)
it was they did a good job pairing (58:31 - 58:35)
pokemon with the figureheads because (58:33 - 58:38)
they they feel like they fit yeah but (58:35 - 58:41)
other than that it it was I couldn't do (58:38 - 58:43)
it for too long I feel like it's also (58:41 - 58:46)
not my type of game like I kind of got (58:43 - 58:48)
into fire emblem II heroes is that what (58:46 - 58:50)
the mobile game is called and I liked it (58:48 - 58:53)
for what it was but that was such a (58:50 - 58:57)
shorter / more puzzle eversion of the (58:53 - 59:00)
long form fire emblem (58:57 - 59:01)
I don't know if they made another (59:00 - 59:04)
conquest game where they re-released (59:01 - 59:05)
conquest or something of the sort I (59:04 - 59:07)
would absolutely go back to it or give (59:05 - 59:10)
it another try but I feel like it just (59:07 - 59:12)
doesn't fit what kind of games I like I (59:10 - 59:14)
mean I don't like anything so that makes (59:12 - 59:19)
sense but uh but why it writes in from (59:14 - 59:24)
yamhill Oregon what what a location are (59:19 - 59:26)
there lots of yams up there yeah up on (59:24 - 59:29)

I have not I don't think they've opened (60:03 - 60:09)
up panel registration yet based off of (60:06 - 60:12)
filling the room for pax east I would (60:09 - 60:15)

more email this one is from Simon (64:03 - 64:09)
location is 28 canoe I don't know what (64:06 - 64:13)
that means oh they say hi spj and other (64:09 - 64:15)
people on I just want to tell you how (64:13 - 64:17)
much I enjoy the show and it is the best (64:15 - 64:20)
that I've seen best out of 10 others (64:17 - 64:21)
that I've seen I'm assuming they have (64:20 - 64:24)
listened to 10 other Pokemon podcast one (64:21 - 64:26)
question what is your preferred pokeball (64:24 - 64:29)
choice keep up the great work Simon mmm (64:26 - 64:34)
dusk ball for me the dusk ball it that's (64:29 - 64:37)
a really nice shredder that's not a (64:34 - 64:40)
serially good choice I used to be all (64:37 - 64:43)
about the premier ball but I've moved on (64:40 - 64:46)
you've moved on hold on this news (64:43 - 64:49)
because as of mid west gaming classic (64:46 - 64:52)
you were giving someone a lecture on how (64:49 - 64:57)
you always go with premier balls yes but (64:52 - 64:59)
I never elaborated that I've since (64:57 - 65:01)
switched from premier balls I switched (64:59 - 65:04)
like halfway through sudden moon to what (65:01 - 65:09)
the luxury bow oh wow all right (65:04 - 65:12)
someone's too fancy for premier balls (65:09 - 65:15)
now huh the legs your balls are really (65:12 - 65:17)
great the golden black look real good (65:15 - 65:20)
together I do like the look but it's not (65:17 - 65:21)
gonna be catching that many pokemons (65:20 - 65:25)
it's true I'm with will on this one I (65:21 - 65:27)
really like dusk ball and I really like (65:25 - 65:30)
the feeling of quick balling something (65:27 - 65:32)
right out of the gate I hate the quick (65:30 - 65:35)
lock it works I caught my soul gilio (65:32 - 65:38)
with a quick ball liquid such a cop-out (65:35 - 65:41)
set that's fine now cuz it smells like (65:38 - 65:44)
it's a real victory the quick balls like (65:41 - 65:47)
blue and like a yellow like oh it's ugly (65:44 - 65:49)
it looks like the x-men the original (65:47 - 65:53)
uniform yeah it's definitely ugly so for (65:49 - 65:57)
me I feel like Pikachu or electro fire (65:53 - 66:01)
or I'm just naming electric pokemon (65:57 - 66:04)
fossils noticeable yeah what's gonna (66:01 - 66:06)
look best in the luxury balls that way (66:04 - 66:08)
no they look best in like they look best (66:06 - 66:10)
in a quick ball oh cuz its got like a (66:08 - 66:12)
lightning bolt on it right I would never (66:10 - 66:15)
attach a geodude in a quick ball because (66:12 - 66:17)
that doesn't look good but would you (66:15 - 66:19)
catch like a really colorful pokemon (66:17 - 66:21)
with a luxury ball because the luxury (66:19 - 66:24)
ball is like really pretty bland looking (66:21 - 66:25)
well that's why it works for pretty much (66:24 - 66:28)
every Pokemon it has all that's why (66:25 - 66:30)
premier ball where every Pokemon cuz (66:28 - 66:33)
it's white and red and the lottery balls (66:30 - 66:35)
black and gold see that is a little bit (66:33 - 66:37)
more I I group cuz it's like it's blank (66:35 - 66:40)
it's like as a blank ball but the luxury (66:37 - 66:42)
ball is like it's got a color scheme I (66:40 - 66:48)
wouldn't catch a machamp in a net ball (66:42 - 66:50)
that just doesn't look right it doesn't (66:48 - 66:52)
look good you're right now you got to (66:50 - 66:53)
catch him a champ in a master ball (66:52 - 66:55)
because it has an M on the outside like (66:53 - 66:57)
Machamp that's yeah you're not wrong (66:55 - 67:01)
that I can buy that I also don't like (66:57 - 67:04)
using great balls or alter balls because (67:01 - 67:07)
I feel like I don't know why they just (67:04 - 67:09)
bothered me it's just it's it's that (67:07 - 67:11)
mindset of like it's that mindset of oh (67:09 - 67:13)
you only had a great bowler you only had (67:11 - 67:15)
an ultra ball so you just used it and (67:13 - 67:18)
got it and now if I breed that pokémon (67:15 - 67:20)
all its babies are going to be in great (67:18 - 67:22)
balls and then somebody's going to (67:20 - 67:24)
question why is it why is it not in an (67:22 - 67:25)
Ultra Ball why is it why is it in a (67:24 - 67:27)
great ball and then you catch something (67:25 - 67:29)
in an ultra ball and then people (67:27 - 67:31)
question of why it's not as asking these (67:29 - 67:35)
questions as the the personas in my mind (67:31 - 67:36)
the (67:35 - 67:40)
the ultra ball the the great ball or two (67:36 - 67:42)
bush league for luxury ball Steve over (67:40 - 67:45)
here I mean ever gonna go all out call (67:42 - 67:48)
out don't don't you go honey really with (67:45 - 67:50)
a great ball not even the premier ball (67:48 - 67:54)
is good enough these days now the real I (67:50 - 67:56)
got a three ball Steve I'll still use (67:54 - 67:58)
the premier ball I'm just I'm just not a (67:56 - 68:00)
fan of great balls or ultra balls I (67:58 - 68:02)
guess that that's what I'm saying who's (68:00 - 68:04)
saying that the great ball is their (68:02 - 68:06)
favorite ball no one's gonna say that (68:04 - 68:08)
it's not like poke balls actually sound (68:06 - 68:09)
like your catch rates actually matter (68:08 - 68:13)
none of it matters none of this man you (68:09 - 68:15)
know many ultra balls I threw at a taboo (68:13 - 68:18)
Finney and it didn't matter 1hp well (68:15 - 68:20)
that's sleep that's for legendary 20 (68:18 - 68:22)
ultra balls later still not caught I (68:20 - 68:24)
hate I hate everything about pokeballs (68:22 - 68:27)
they just don't work we're talking to (68:24 - 68:29)
the guy who uses master ball in a cold (68:27 - 68:32)

not hard to do I don't know what the the (71:39 - 71:43)
the rainbow turns into when it's shiny (71:41 - 71:45)
but I got some trivia for you although (71:43 - 71:48)
mux body is very poisonous it doesn't (71:45 - 71:51)
seem to harm ash when other mux are (71:48 - 71:53)
hugging them this is probably because (71:51 - 71:55)
it's able to control whether it gives (71:53 - 71:57)
off poison or not similar to how ponyta (71:55 - 71:59)
can choose whether or not to burn a (71:57 - 72:01)
person that it touches croagunk is (71:59 - 72:03)
another pokemon which is able to (72:01 - 72:05)
control the amount of poison it uses via (72:03 - 72:08)
its fingertips when using poison jab or (72:05 - 72:10)
Sharpedo activating its ability rough (72:08 - 72:14)
skin what a what a trivia muck shares (72:10 - 72:16)

types with a single pre-revolution (72:18 - 72:23)
roughly have the same base that totals (72:20 - 72:27)
and evolution levels and appear to be (72:23 - 72:29)
based on different kinds of pollution (72:27 - 72:32)
muck being water pollution muck has the (72:29 - 72:35)
highest average performance of every of (72:32 - 72:38)
any fully evolved pokémon alone muck and (72:35 - 72:40)
