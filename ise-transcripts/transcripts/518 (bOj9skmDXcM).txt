anymore but make a run for the border is (1:57 - 2:03)
it aviva (2:00 - 2:03)
how would i even know what anybody (2:03 - 2:07)

paramount plus because i'm not paying (2:07 - 2:11)
the extra five dollars to not watch the (2:09 - 2:13)
ads but all of my ads are (2:11 - 2:16)
still for adult retirement communities (2:13 - 2:19)

[Music] (2:41 - 2:46)
it's pizza and it's mexican what's (2:44 - 2:48)
amazing about (2:46 - 2:50)
look i've had my fill of taco pizzas (2:48 - 2:52)
from the 80s no no it was a fad and it (2:50 - 2:54)
was bad this is this is this it's even (2:52 - 2:56)
worse it's like the amazing thing about (2:54 - 2:59)
the mexican pizza at taco bell is it's (2:56 - 3:01)
literally something you could have made (2:59 - 3:02)
in your dorm room (3:01 - 3:04)
at one point out of desperation it's (3:02 - 3:07)
like oh i've got flour tortillas i've (3:04 - 3:09)
got grated cheese and i've got dinty (3:07 - 3:12)
more beef stew i'll stack them on top of (3:09 - 3:14)
that (3:12 - 3:18)
[Laughter] (3:14 - 3:18)
uh we don't have a terrible amount of (3:19 - 3:23)
news uh (3:22 - 3:26)
happening this week although it is (3:23 - 3:27)
halfway through the week so who knows (3:26 - 3:29)
maybe they'll do a right event on (3:27 - 3:32)
thursday night like they always do and (3:29 - 3:33)
reason we're recording early is because (3:32 - 3:35)
it is milwaukee regionals so i will be (3:33 - 3:37)
going back to milwaukee for the first (3:35 - 3:40)
time since i left milwaukee um and it's (3:37 - 3:42)
gonna be so different you are not gonna (3:40 - 3:45)
recognize be amazed they have moved all (3:42 - 3:46)
the districts around all the bricks are (3:45 - 3:49)
different colors now all the uh third (3:46 - 3:51)
ward is now called the seventh ward all (3:49 - 3:55)
the altarias have closed yep (3:51 - 3:57)
no they're called collectivos (3:55 - 3:59)
i thought they were called alteria in (3:57 - 4:02)
milwaukee and colectivo outside of (3:59 - 4:06)
milwaukee no it's uh the company that (4:02 - 4:09)
bought it bought the name altera (4:06 - 4:11)
and then they they well that doesn't (4:09 - 4:13)
sound like a pokemon at all (4:11 - 4:15)
they changed their name to colectivo (4:13 - 4:17)
which i believe they are unionized now i (4:15 - 4:19)
believe they are the biggest (4:17 - 4:21)
coffee union (4:19 - 4:24)
in the world (4:21 - 4:27)
they have shops in milwaukee (4:24 - 4:29)
um yeah probably not that i there's like (4:27 - 4:31)
12 collectives in milwaukee they're (4:29 - 4:32)
they're good i like colectivo some (4:31 - 4:36)
people don't well collect kiva them all (4:32 - 4:36)
that's a really good transition actually (4:38 - 4:44)
hey i'm good at this job (4:40 - 4:44)
um (4:45 - 4:48)
boy where do we start we've been (4:46 - 4:50)

upcoming for pogo which i don't know if (4:55 - 4:59)
we talked about um (4:56 - 5:00)
we'll save that for after the break i (4:59 - 5:04)
guess uh this is off essentially sports (5:00 - 5:06)
the pokemon company (5:04 - 5:08)
immediately suss (5:06 - 5:09)
immediately.com (5:08 - 5:12)
what does this essentially sports have (5:09 - 5:15)
to do with pokemon the i will read the (5:12 - 5:18)
headline the pokemon company shows off (5:15 - 5:21)
franchise's insanely popular popularity (5:18 - 5:23)
with a statistic in the billions (5:21 - 5:26)
the pokemon video game franchise needs (5:23 - 5:28)
no introduction in recent updates the (5:26 - 5:30)
pokemon company took to their official (5:28 - 5:32)
website uh to share a blog post with (5:30 - 5:34)
their success the popular publisher has (5:32 - 5:37)
shared is that its titles have sold more (5:34 - 5:39)
than a staggering (5:37 - 5:43)
444 million times (5:39 - 5:43)
that was that was that was the news wait (5:46 - 5:49)
there (5:48 - 5:51)
that there's (5:49 - 5:53)
things missing there (5:51 - 5:57)
units what what is sold (5:53 - 5:57)
link (5:57 - 6:00)
this article is there even a blog what (5:58 - 6:02)
is this made-up blog this is like that (6:00 - 6:05)
one website that says that kabutops is (6:02 - 6:08)
the second hardest pokemon to get in red (6:05 - 6:13)
and blue after you two and i'm like what (6:08 - 6:13)
if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes i (6:14 - 6:17)
wouldn't believe that somebody would (6:16 - 6:19)
literally post that as (6:17 - 6:22)
a blog (6:19 - 6:22)
i i knew that this was going to happen i (6:23 - 6:28)
i i knew that this would come up (6:26 - 6:29)
uh (6:28 - 6:31)
i don't (6:29 - 6:34)
so i i pulled a different article (6:31 - 6:38)
off visual capitalist oh my gosh (6:34 - 6:41)
what are these things what dark deep web (6:38 - 6:44)
are you going to what sort of back pass (6:41 - 6:46)
do you have into the worst sites in the (6:44 - 6:47)
world (6:46 - 6:51)
shipments over 440 million shipments as (6:47 - 6:53)
of march 2022 (6:51 - 6:54)
yes (6:53 - 6:58)
series is in nine languages uh 43 (6:54 - 7:02)
billion cards 13 languages for the cards (6:58 - 7:02)
um (7:02 - 7:05)
so i i think we've talked we've talked (7:02 - 7:07)
about this before for sure (7:05 - 7:09)
um (7:07 - 7:11)
and i think this conversation is going (7:09 - 7:14)
to come up anyways because of scarlet (7:11 - 7:18)
and violet and the the consensus the (7:14 - 7:21)
negative consensus is (7:18 - 7:23)
the pokemon company makes so much money (7:21 - 7:26)
why does their trees look bad right (7:23 - 7:29)
that's like the general gist of whatever (7:26 - 7:31)
or the pokemon company makes so much (7:29 - 7:33)
money why (7:31 - 7:36)
does the animations tail whip is bad (7:33 - 7:38)
whatever you insert whatever bad thing (7:36 - 7:39)
you want (7:38 - 7:41)
and then also make a lot of money but i (7:39 - 7:43)
don't want that dude doing my portrait (7:41 - 7:46)
but also then insert that like they make (7:43 - 7:48)
a lot of money those are your two things (7:46 - 7:50)
i don't i'm not happy with this the (7:48 - 7:52)
company makes a lot of money so this is (7:50 - 7:53)
from three years ago this is from (7:52 - 7:56)
november 22 2019 (7:53 - 7:59)
uh off a visual capitalist oh it's a (7:56 - 8:03)
much better website it is the world's 25 (7:59 - 8:06)
most successful media franchises (8:03 - 8:08)
and it has a breakdown here pokemon is (8:06 - 8:09)
number one (8:08 - 8:12)
um so get a little old but that's why i (8:09 - 8:14)
put both articles together there was a (8:12 - 8:16)
thought process there um and if you're (8:14 - 8:18)
if you just recently started listening (8:16 - 8:19)
to the show (8:18 - 8:21)
i think the last time we talked about (8:19 - 8:22)
this was probably closer to sword and (8:21 - 8:24)
shield release date so i think it's i (8:22 - 8:26)
think it's due (8:24 - 8:28)
uh of of what's happening here (8:26 - 8:30)
so um (8:28 - 8:32)
again end of 2019 i'll go through the (8:30 - 8:33)
the general (8:32 - 8:37)
mun numbers here the pokemon company 92 (8:33 - 8:39)
billion dollars (8:37 - 8:41)
uh in in (8:39 - 8:43)
grossing media friend top 25 grossing (8:41 - 8:46)
media franchises of all time hello kitty (8:43 - 8:49)
80 billion dollars (8:46 - 8:51)
it it's funny because i've seen tick (8:49 - 8:52)
tocks of this too or like they'll be (8:51 - 8:54)
like these are the (8:52 - 8:55)
biggest money bank and then they always (8:54 - 8:57)
get to hello kitty and they're like i (8:55 - 8:58)
don't know why it's like because you're (8:57 - 9:00)
american (8:58 - 9:02)
you never left the united states do they (9:00 - 9:05)
listen as hello kitty or sanrio hello (9:02 - 9:06)
kitty (9:05 - 9:08)
that's weird because i always like i (9:06 - 9:10)
mean hello kitty is not my favorite of (9:08 - 9:12)
them nah it's not my favorite either but (9:10 - 9:15)
i don't i (9:12 - 9:15)
hello kitty is popular literally (9:16 - 9:19)
everywhere it is yeah yeah yeah yeah (9:18 - 9:22)
literally everything you can go i can go (9:19 - 9:25)
to the target in richfield minnesota and (9:22 - 9:27)
find a gudetama toy like i don't (9:25 - 9:30)
understand like how you can say like (9:27 - 9:33)
hello kitty what like literally go to (9:30 - 9:35)
anywhere (9:33 - 9:37)
tourist stops have a hello kitty (9:35 - 9:38)
something in the back (9:37 - 9:40)
you can go to like your local grocery (9:38 - 9:42)
store i am sure there's hello kitty (9:40 - 9:45)
something in there i i guarantee in this (9:42 - 9:47)
very room i have hello kitty stuff i (9:45 - 9:48)
bought (9:47 - 9:50)
i don't i don't drink alcohol at all but (9:48 - 9:53)
i bought hello kitty sake uh when i was (9:50 - 9:56)
at they had um it was like sake wine and (9:53 - 9:58)
then something else i think the last one (9:56 - 10:01)
was vodka (9:58 - 10:02)
but i was at a japanese marketplace in (10:01 - 10:05)
chicago and (10:02 - 10:06)
it was (10:05 - 10:08)
it's funny because (10:06 - 10:10)
for whatever reason the alcohol industry (10:08 - 10:11)
can (10:10 - 10:13)
get away with advertising to children in (10:11 - 10:15)
whatever way they want but they had like (10:13 - 10:17)
through the three hello kitty alcohols (10:15 - 10:19)
and then they they had like little like (10:17 - 10:22)
you know the the tags that people put on (10:19 - 10:24)
your doorknob of like (10:22 - 10:26)
buy pizza oh yeah yeah they had like (10:24 - 10:28)
those tags on each one being like this (10:26 - 10:31)
is not for children (10:28 - 10:33)
well (10:31 - 10:35)
there are many adult fans of hello kitty (10:33 - 10:37)
there are adult (10:35 - 10:40)
products of the hello kitty a variety (10:37 - 10:42)
hello clearly because if pokemon was not (10:40 - 10:46)
here hello kitty would be number one (10:42 - 10:48)
uh number three (10:46 - 10:50)
winnie the pooh (10:48 - 10:50)
okay (10:51 - 10:55)
i think winnie the pooh got really (10:53 - 10:56)
carried away with licensing at one point (10:55 - 10:58)
and they just (10:56 - 11:00)
oh and it was definitely much more (10:58 - 11:02)
popular when i was younger oh way more (11:00 - 11:05)
popular when i was younger than today (11:02 - 11:08)
uh number four uh mickey mouse (11:05 - 11:09)
yeah see this is weird great because (11:08 - 11:12)
they say pokemon as (11:09 - 11:13)
like the (11:12 - 11:15)
universal but then they're doing like (11:13 - 11:18)
these individual characters because like (11:15 - 11:20)
for me like saying hello kitty is like (11:18 - 11:23)
saying pikachu for pokemon yeah but then (11:20 - 11:25)
to say winnie the pooh (11:23 - 11:26)
because winnie the pooh is owned by (11:25 - 11:28)
disney mickey mouse's own well winnie (11:26 - 11:30)
the pooh red shirt is owned by disney (11:28 - 11:33)
winnie the pooh no shirt is in public (11:30 - 11:35)
domain right now oh geez (11:33 - 11:38)
is it very like if you're doing fan art (11:35 - 11:40)
it's a very important thing if you put a (11:38 - 11:42)
red shirt on that bear you are going to (11:40 - 11:44)
get sued okay (11:42 - 11:47)
who's after mickey (11:44 - 11:50)
factor after mickey is star wars yeah (11:47 - 11:52)
also at disney (11:50 - 11:54)
uh after star after star wars is on pond (11:52 - 11:57)

for actual children man is like for like (12:02 - 12:09)
it's i would say maybe like japan's (12:06 - 12:11)
barney i guess it's like that same age (12:09 - 12:13)
range (12:11 - 12:16)
i have to look it up because when i met (12:13 - 12:17)
uh when i met yeah (12:16 - 12:20)
andrew and his wife in japan and i met (12:17 - 12:22)
their twins um (12:20 - 12:24)

we're not five because they're going to (12:29 - 12:34)

a half to three okay but we we we met (12:41 - 12:46)

had a giant statue of anpanman like well (12:53 - 12:57)
they had anpanman pretty much everywhere (12:55 - 12:59)
also if you're in japan it's like once (12:57 - 13:01)
you figure out who anpanman is and (12:59 - 13:02)
you're in japan it's it's like the hello (13:01 - 13:05)

man on pawn man like non-stop they were (13:14 - 13:18)
very into (13:16 - 13:20)
on pawn man and i think the thing about (13:18 - 13:22)
on pond man (13:20 - 13:23)
and why it's like really good for little (13:22 - 13:24)
kids is it's (13:23 - 13:28)
it's very easy for a in like a small (13:24 - 13:30)
child to say on pawn man like it's (13:28 - 13:32)
designed to be able to be said very (13:30 - 13:35)
easily for kids (13:32 - 13:39)
um after onpodman is disney princesses (13:35 - 13:41)

star wars was 65 billion dollars just to (14:18 - 14:23)
remind you pokemon we were at 92 billion (14:20 - 14:26)
dollars um okay so then we have harry (14:23 - 14:28)
potter (14:26 - 14:31)
at 30 billion dollars we have the marvel (14:28 - 14:34)
cinematic universe at 29 billion (14:31 - 14:37)
spider-man at 27 billion (14:34 - 14:39)
which is a marvel (14:37 - 14:42)
yeah but no spider-man is half sony or (14:39 - 14:45)
yeah (14:42 - 14:45)
the rights to make the movies belong to (14:48 - 14:54)
sony possibly (14:50 - 14:57)
but that doesn't make spider-man not a (14:54 - 14:59)
marvel character but it's not from here (14:57 - 15:02)
terrible cinematic universe (14:59 - 15:04)
who don't own spider-man cinematic (15:02 - 15:05)
spider-man (15:04 - 15:07)
in three years ninety percent of this (15:05 - 15:10)
list will be owned by disney yeah (15:07 - 15:12)
because marvel is owned by disney (15:10 - 15:14)
marvel's owned by disney well marvel (15:12 - 15:15)
says thematic universe is definitely (15:14 - 15:17)

mean i i get it but i'm surprised that (15:26 - 15:30)
that's still that big i thought they (15:29 - 15:32)
would dip (15:30 - 15:34)
below the billion mark (15:32 - 15:37)
um and then we have batman uh at 26 (15:34 - 15:40)
billion dollars dragon ball z at 24 (15:37 - 15:41)
billion (15:40 - 15:45)
barbie at 24 billion fist of the north (15:41 - 15:47)
star at 21 billion (15:45 - 15:48)
cars (15:47 - 15:52)
the pixar movie at 21 billion oddly (15:48 - 15:54)
enough toy story after that at 20 (15:52 - 15:57)
billion both of those movies are (15:54 - 16:01)
doused in in merchandise in stores (15:57 - 16:05)
uh after that is one piece at 20 billion (16:01 - 16:08)
lord of the rings at 19 billion james (16:05 - 16:11)
bond at 19 billion (16:08 - 16:15)
yugioh at 19 billion peanuts the with (16:11 - 16:16)
snoopy (16:15 - 16:17)
if you're (16:16 - 16:19)
young and you don't know what peanuts is (16:17 - 16:22)
at 17 billion (16:19 - 16:26)
transformers at 17 billion more than (16:22 - 16:28)
meets the eye (16:26 - 16:28)
so i am shocked (16:29 - 16:34)
where's the minions (16:32 - 16:37)
out of the minions not made this list (16:34 - 16:38)
look they're too young (16:37 - 16:40)
true i guess (16:38 - 16:43)
so now now we can go through i know this (16:40 - 16:46)
is an audio podcast uh but (16:43 - 16:49)
the (16:46 - 16:49)
the we go back to the initial (16:49 - 16:53)
conversation is i'm not happy with these (16:50 - 16:55)
video games because of x (16:53 - 16:57)
they have they are the they make the (16:55 - 17:00)
most money in the world (16:57 - 17:02)
media wise (17:00 - 17:06)
92 billion dollars uh of the video game (17:02 - 17:07)
part (17:06 - 17:10)
of the 92 billion (17:07 - 17:13)
uh the video games bring in (17:10 - 17:15)
17 billion (17:13 - 17:21)
of the 92 billion not even half (17:15 - 17:22)
and (17:21 - 17:24)
well more than half the merchandise (17:22 - 17:27)
alone that is t-shirts (17:24 - 17:31)
uh plushes more plushes uh the (17:27 - 17:34)
dollar metal pokeballs (17:31 - 17:36)
that's such a rule (17:34 - 17:39)
you name it that is that is sickness (17:36 - 17:40)
clothing that deceives steve into (17:39 - 17:42)
thinking it's biking clothing sure (17:40 - 17:44)
that's true they did take pictures on a (17:42 - 17:46)
bike that is 61 (17:44 - 17:51)
billion of the night it is two thirds (17:46 - 17:52)
two (17:51 - 17:56)
thirds of all of their money is plushes (17:52 - 17:58)
is action figures (17:56 - 17:59)
is (17:58 - 18:01)
uh (17:59 - 18:03)
color coloring books (18:01 - 18:05)
it is it is (18:03 - 18:08)
a lot and i (18:05 - 18:08)
i just want to remind people (18:08 - 18:13)
that yes the pokemon company makes a lot (18:11 - 18:14)
of money (18:13 - 18:17)
when they sell a pikachu plush you're (18:14 - 18:19)
that is not a dollar going into game (18:17 - 18:22)
freak to be like ah yes we can enhance (18:19 - 18:24)
our bush engine to make sure that it's (18:22 - 18:27)
the the finest bush in the like when a (18:24 - 18:29)
plush is sold game freak isn't suddenly (18:27 - 18:31)
like doused like i don't know what the (18:29 - 18:32)
pokemon company is doing with their (18:31 - 18:34)
money (18:32 - 18:36)
but i i don't think it's like (18:34 - 18:39)
okay to be fair (18:36 - 18:41)
they can't decide to invest the money (18:39 - 18:43)
from other products (18:41 - 18:46)
into other things they could yes (18:43 - 18:49)
they're going to invest like every (18:46 - 18:51)
company does where they make the most (18:49 - 18:52)
money (18:51 - 18:55)
so if merchandise (18:52 - 18:58)
makes them the most money and (18:55 - 19:00)
profit of their money they are going to (18:58 - 19:01)
push the money there (19:00 - 19:03)
because that's where they make the big (19:01 - 19:05)
bucks (19:03 - 19:07)
um the the trading cards is different (19:05 - 19:09)
than merchandise (19:07 - 19:13)
uh the trading cards is uh 10 (19:09 - 19:14)
billion (19:13 - 19:17)
of the 92 billion so again the (19:14 - 19:20)
merchandise is 61 billion which is (19:17 - 19:21)
two-thirds (19:20 - 19:24)
uh video games is 17 billion the card (19:21 - 19:26)
games this pieces of paper (19:24 - 19:28)
10 billion (19:26 - 19:30)
like literally half (19:28 - 19:32)
half of the video games is just them and (19:30 - 19:35)
still don't have a good live client to (19:32 - 19:38)
play online (19:35 - 19:38)
into a good tcgo online player (19:39 - 19:46)
uh the comic books in manga 1.5 billion (19:43 - 19:48)
for pokemon um (19:46 - 19:49)
movies (19:48 - 19:51)
why are they still making a movie every (19:49 - 19:53)
year well it brings them 1.31 billion (19:51 - 19:55)
dollars (19:53 - 19:57)
uh and then (19:55 - 20:00)
the home entertainment (19:57 - 20:04)
that would be like dvd sales and (20:00 - 20:06)
that's uh almost a billion it's 860 (20:04 - 20:09)
million for that so that's where pokemon (20:06 - 20:12)
sleep slides in right there and then if (20:09 - 20:13)
we were to compare this to hello kitty (20:12 - 20:16)
of the 80 billion um hello kitty's (20:13 - 20:19)
merchandise is about 80 billion of the (20:16 - 20:22)
80 billion what else do they make (20:19 - 20:25)
uh they have um some comics and manga (20:22 - 20:27)
yeah i mean they have some comics about (20:25 - 20:29)
some movies they have um about three (20:27 - 20:31)
million dollar sales and music i'm not (20:29 - 20:34)
sure exactly what that music is but (20:31 - 20:36)
of winnie the pooh (20:34 - 20:41)
of the 75 billion dollars 74 billion is (20:36 - 20:43)
merchandise (20:41 - 20:44)
um (20:43 - 20:46)
mickey mouse is pretty much the same (20:44 - 20:48)
thing going to harry potter 65 billion (20:46 - 20:50)
dollars of (20:48 - 20:52)
sorry not harry potter star wars 65 (20:50 - 20:54)
billion dollars of star wars (20:52 - 20:58)
40 million 40 billion of that is (20:54 - 21:00)
merchandise (20:58 - 21:03)
star wars was the originator oh it was (21:00 - 21:04)
the weather (21:03 - 21:06)
hold on (21:04 - 21:09)
um to to jump over to within reach (21:06 - 21:11)
to jump over to the original packaging (21:09 - 21:14)
video game stuff mario (21:11 - 21:15)
mario (21:14 - 21:18)
36 billion dollars here 30 (21:15 - 21:22)
billion of the 36 billion is their video (21:18 - 21:25)
game sales which is almost (21:22 - 21:28)
double pokemon's video game sales (21:25 - 21:29)
so (21:28 - 21:31)
mario games look really great i don't (21:29 - 21:33)
think anyone's debating how great mario (21:31 - 21:36)
mario odyssey looks or mario striker or (21:33 - 21:37)
what whatever the new strikers game (21:36 - 21:39)
comes out or tennis uh i play mario (21:37 - 21:41)
party way too often unfortunately my (21:39 - 21:45)
wife loves mario parties (21:41 - 21:45)
we can make it happen just like lunch (21:46 - 21:50)
we'll get lunch (21:48 - 21:51)
the stars will align the three of us (21:50 - 21:52)
will get lunch and then the three you (21:51 - 21:55)
know the person that (21:52 - 21:59)
is worth that wakes up at like 4 p.m (21:55 - 22:02)
i got up at 10 for to record this (21:59 - 22:05)
uh so again mario is 30 billion dollars (22:02 - 22:08)
pokemon is 17 billion dollars it's just (22:05 - 22:10)
a very interesting statistic uh even (22:08 - 22:13)
though pokemon games sell really well (22:10 - 22:15)
i think there's a lot more mario titles (22:13 - 22:17)
there are yeah (22:15 - 22:19)
a lot mario's on everything in (22:17 - 22:21)
everything does everything (22:19 - 22:22)
mario gets around mario's merchandise (22:21 - 22:25)
though only four point three billion oh (22:22 - 22:27)
they're very buy the hat what else do (22:25 - 22:28)
you need well but yeah and a lot of the (22:27 - 22:30)
mario merchandise just looks dumb i was (22:28 - 22:34)
like i don't want to have it in my house (22:30 - 22:34)
um so i we can go through the list uh so (22:35 - 22:40)
but the rest of the list but i think (22:38 - 22:42)
that's just a interesting thing that yes (22:40 - 22:46)
the pokemon company makes a lot of money (22:42 - 22:48)
yes (22:46 - 22:49)
all of that money that they're making (22:48 - 22:52)
are just not going back into (22:49 - 22:54)
pokemon shuffle uh you would want it to (22:52 - 22:56)
go into pokemon shuffle maybe a little (22:54 - 22:58)
bit in the cafe mix but (22:56 - 23:00)
i think a lot of it is going back into (22:58 - 23:04)
how many more ways can we stuff pikachu (23:00 - 23:06)
pokemon shuffle anymore (23:04 - 23:07)
you know they don't that that's the (23:06 - 23:11)
problem they're not making enough money (23:07 - 23:13)
the 92 billion dollars they could spare (23:11 - 23:16)
a billion for shuffle no ah no that game (23:13 - 23:18)
is garbage (23:16 - 23:20)
match match threes are done the day they (23:18 - 23:22)
just freezes (23:20 - 23:24)
they just need to build a story around (23:22 - 23:28)
it that's better than the story they had (23:24 - 23:28)
got it (23:28 - 23:31)
um (23:30 - 23:34)
speaking of merchandise (23:31 - 23:39)
pokemon center and craft sportswear (23:34 - 23:41)
are teaming up together i've never heard (23:39 - 23:44)
of this company i had to look it up the (23:41 - 23:45)
other day (23:44 - 23:47)
it is a craft sportswear is it is a (23:45 - 23:50)
company and they they're like (23:47 - 23:51)
they're in the they're in the same price (23:50 - 23:54)
range as like lululemon (23:51 - 23:56)
oh that's too expensive (23:54 - 23:58)
you're you got that right being a (23:56 - 24:00)
pokemon requires strength and commitment (23:58 - 24:03)
this is off pokemon.com i wanna i'm (24:00 - 24:05)
going to add my own words to this (24:03 - 24:06)
sentence (24:05 - 24:08)
being a pokemon (24:06 - 24:10)
trainer requires money (24:08 - 24:12)
and more money (24:10 - 24:14)
because these clothes are insanely (24:12 - 24:18)
expensive they're not that bad (24:14 - 24:20)
if i wanted the if i wanted the hoodie (24:18 - 24:24)
and jogger combo it was like 150 dollars (24:20 - 24:26)
that's called quality baby (24:24 - 24:28)
i don't know well i don't know because (24:26 - 24:29)
i've never heard of craft the pokemon (24:28 - 24:31)
company and craft sportswear (24:29 - 24:34)

part that i'm annoyed by the good (25:24 - 25:28)
designs (25:26 - 25:32)
are only in women's styles (25:28 - 25:32)
it's 2022 don't let the yeah don't let (25:32 - 25:36)
the (25:35 - 25:37)
the (25:36 - 25:42)
gender those cuts do not work on my body (25:37 - 25:42)
like the gardevoir essence jacket is (25:46 - 25:50)
amazing and i'm already looking at the (25:48 - 25:53)
cut and i'm like there is not a chance (25:50 - 25:57)
that that cut will fit my body (25:53 - 25:59)
not a chance the only thing i don't (25:57 - 26:01)
understand is (25:59 - 26:02)
the pictures (26:01 - 26:05)
on the landing page (26:02 - 26:07)
one of the bike pictures which just (26:05 - 26:09)
deceived steve shows a blue pair of (26:07 - 26:11)
shorts with a yellow pikachu on it (26:09 - 26:13)
but when i go (26:11 - 26:14)
into (26:13 - 26:16)
the section there's no (26:14 - 26:19)
blue pair of shorts with a pikachu no (26:16 - 26:20)
there isn't (26:19 - 26:23)
they've already sold out (26:20 - 26:26)
yeah (26:23 - 26:28)
i i did go to crafts website they have (26:26 - 26:29)
their own website they sell their own (26:28 - 26:31)
stuff um (26:29 - 26:33)
i've the the hoodie that i was looking (26:31 - 26:35)
at which is the pokemon center gengar (26:33 - 26:37)
unified burgundy hoodie which is ninety (26:35 - 26:39)
dollars (26:37 - 26:40)
um (26:39 - 26:42)
the the same hoodie i found on their (26:40 - 26:44)
website that was in all black (26:42 - 26:48)
no no gengar nope no words just craft (26:44 - 26:50)
uh was (26:48 - 26:51)
seventy dollars (26:50 - 26:55)
so the pokemon tax on this is about 20 (26:51 - 26:56)
if you want a (26:55 - 26:57)
gang are slapped in the back of this (26:56 - 27:00)
hoodie (26:57 - 27:00)
ah (27:00 - 27:02)
i know like (27:02 - 27:07)
i know lulu lemon is expensive (27:04 - 27:09)
and i have zero damn (27:07 - 27:11)
i have zero lululemon stuff i also hear (27:09 - 27:14)
that company is bad at the highest (27:11 - 27:15)
um (27:14 - 27:17)
and so (27:15 - 27:19)
nike i guess would be the like the (27:17 - 27:21)
second sports stuff i like i do have (27:19 - 27:24)
some nike stuff uh when i worked at (27:21 - 27:25)
apple (27:24 - 27:27)
because nike is on the board of (27:25 - 27:29)
directors at apple or whatever like (27:27 - 27:30)
apple employees would get discounts for (27:29 - 27:32)
nike stuff so i have like a little bit (27:30 - 27:33)
of nike stuff (27:32 - 27:35)
but i don't think nike is known as like (27:33 - 27:38)
this amazing quality anymore (27:35 - 27:40)
uh it depends on which line you buy (27:38 - 27:42)
they have a range (27:40 - 27:45)
but like a moisture wicking t-shirt from (27:42 - 27:48)
nike is like what like 35 maybe 30. (27:45 - 27:50)
30 to 50. (27:48 - 27:51)
yeah (27:50 - 27:53)
so i don't i've never owned a moisture (27:51 - 27:56)
wicking hoodie uh i also don't work out (27:53 - 27:57)
so i (27:56 - 28:01)
don't know if i see the value at 90 (27:57 - 28:04)
dollars i don't sweat so it doesn't do (28:01 - 28:06)
anything for me oh my god (28:04 - 28:07)
did you go outside yesterday i went (28:06 - 28:09)

it's a this is a known issue it it (28:15 - 28:20)
annoys my husband to no end (28:17 - 28:21)
i don't (28:20 - 28:24)
i just don't sweat (28:21 - 28:25)
like it (28:24 - 28:28)
because i'm always cold right like my (28:25 - 28:30)
body is just always cold so standing (28:28 - 28:32)
outside in the humidity when i went for (28:30 - 28:36)

i'm i'm at the gym six days a week thank (28:59 - 29:04)

this issue falls in the same line of (29:04 - 29:11)
i would not make my first trip to the uk (29:08 - 29:13)
pokemon related (29:11 - 29:15)
um if i'm spending (29:13 - 29:17)
that much money for a piece of fitness (29:15 - 29:19)
gear (29:17 - 29:22)
i'm not buying pokemon fitness gear i'm (29:19 - 29:24)
gonna buy (29:22 - 29:26)
something a little more (29:24 - 29:28)
tuned towards what i'm trying to (29:26 - 29:31)
accomplish my bigger question for steve (29:28 - 29:32)
is (29:31 - 29:35)
have you bought the far-fetched (29:32 - 29:36)
hoodie yet (29:35 - 29:38)

design ever the like orange and black (29:38 - 29:43)
one it's so bad (29:41 - 29:47)
the gray one is okay but the orange and (29:43 - 29:48)
black one is (29:47 - 29:50)
awful (29:48 - 29:52)
the gray one (29:50 - 29:55)
i used to be so into zip ups (29:52 - 29:56)
and (29:55 - 29:59)
very against pullovers and there was (29:56 - 30:01)
there was something that happened in my (29:59 - 30:04)
life traumatic i'm not sure probably (30:01 - 30:06)
but now i am very into the the the (30:04 - 30:08)
pullover phase i i don't think i want (30:06 - 30:11)
zip ups anymore (30:08 - 30:11)
uh what's wrong with the orange and (30:13 - 30:16)
black one (30:15 - 30:17)
i (30:16 - 30:19)
because the problem okay so the i think (30:17 - 30:22)
the farfetch'd design is great and it (30:19 - 30:24)
uses a lot of like the tr uh the trans (30:22 - 30:26)
pride flag colors which i i just like (30:24 - 30:28)
love that blue and the pink they look (30:26 - 30:31)
really good together they very like but (30:28 - 30:33)
you have this (30:31 - 30:35)
blue pink very cute farfetch on this (30:33 - 30:39)
harsh bad orange black camo (30:35 - 30:41)
and if you look at just like the shirts (30:39 - 30:44)
above where it's like watercolor of like (30:41 - 30:46)
blue and pink and white like why didn't (30:44 - 30:48)
they just slap the farfetch onto that it (30:46 - 30:50)
would have looked significantly better (30:48 - 30:53)
wait that isn't camo (30:50 - 30:56)
what type is farfetch (30:53 - 30:56)
okay so i'm in the hoodies section i (30:57 - 31:02)

i click flying there's no farfetch (31:11 - 31:15)

it says it says it in the name it says (31:27 - 31:31)
it's tie-dye sure they can put a tie-dye (31:29 - 31:34)
in the name but it's it's like it's (31:31 - 31:35)

um (41:43 - 41:49)
that's the event uh (41:45 - 41:49)
i think it's kind of a weak event but (41:50 - 41:55)
also i feel like people are probably (41:53 - 41:56)
burnt out from go fest so maybe it's (41:55 - 42:00)
okay that this is a weaker event (41:56 - 42:02)
unclear why do you say it's weak it (42:00 - 42:04)
seems to be the same as every other (42:02 - 42:06)
event that they ever (42:04 - 42:08)
um weak as in like (42:06 - 42:12)
it is very gen 1 heavy and (42:08 - 42:13)
i (42:12 - 42:14)
if you've been playing since day one a (42:13 - 42:16)
lot of these pokemon you probably don't (42:14 - 42:18)

wimpod favorite (42:24 - 42:27)
i wonder if wimpod runs super easy (42:27 - 42:33)
that would be the style but it's also (42:31 - 42:36)
pokemon go so probably not (42:33 - 42:38)

in pogo so i don't know (43:27 - 43:32)
why i would want to remote raid in (43:30 - 43:33)
like i already have like two mewtwos at (43:32 - 43:36)
max cp as well i guess somebody out (43:33 - 43:39)
there is grinding for (43:36 - 43:41)
mewtwo candy i guess i don't know you (43:39 - 43:43)
don't have to (43:41 - 43:44)
yeah yeah that's the thing is like (43:43 - 43:48)
sometimes things are not for you (43:44 - 43:48)
mewtwo is such an interesting pokemon (43:48 - 43:53)
when it comes to um (43:50 - 43:56)
my experience with casual players (43:53 - 43:58)
like (43:56 - 43:58)
casual people just love mewtwo there's (43:59 - 44:03)
something about mewtwo where they just (44:01 - 44:05)
gravitate because probably it's like the (44:03 - 44:07)
was the (44:05 - 44:08)
first legendary that (44:07 - 44:10)
really stood out to be super powerful (44:08 - 44:12)
and end game stuff (44:10 - 44:16)
and i made you cry when you were a kid (44:12 - 44:16)
i remember playing pogo with my mom and (44:17 - 44:21)
she she did have a bunch of legendaries (44:20 - 44:23)
but she didn't care about she like she (44:21 - 44:25)
wanted mewtwo so badly (44:23 - 44:27)
and i finally did a mewtwo ride with her (44:25 - 44:28)
we were i was some community i think it (44:27 - 44:30)
was chicorita commune day because that's (44:28 - 44:33)
when meltan appeared (44:30 - 44:34)
and i think i think me too was still in (44:33 - 44:36)
raids around then (44:34 - 44:37)
and i was like oh yeah like (44:36 - 44:39)
i think we went to the third ward (44:37 - 44:40)
milwaukee (44:39 - 44:42)
there was mewtwo raids we jumped in (44:40 - 44:45)
and she was like over the moon excited (44:42 - 44:47)
that she like finally got mewtwo and i (44:45 - 44:49)
was like it's just (44:47 - 44:52)
just me too don't yuck somebody else's (44:49 - 44:54)
yum yeah she just really wanted that (44:52 - 44:56)
mewtwo she was very very excited to (44:54 - 44:58)
finally get him (44:56 - 45:00)
um (44:58 - 45:02)
yeah this uh this event exists it's here (45:00 - 45:05)
uh the the details that mewtwo will know (45:02 - 45:09)
um shadowball or sidestrike depending on (45:05 - 45:10)
i think it will know shadowball for a (45:09 - 45:11)
week and then it switches to the (45:10 - 45:13)
sidestrike for a week because me too (45:11 - 45:16)
should be around for two weeks (45:13 - 45:17)
um in (45:16 - 45:18)
general (45:17 - 45:21)
so (45:18 - 45:21)
other bit of news here is there's a (45:24 - 45:27)
single battle cup uh registration is (45:25 - 45:29)
happening right now (45:27 - 45:33)
uh that's in sword and shield (45:29 - 45:35)
uh it is (45:33 - 45:38)
going to use a rank battle series 9 (45:35 - 45:41)
regulations which means mythical pokemon (45:38 - 45:42)
and uh (45:41 - 45:45)
the more powerful legendary and which is (45:42 - 45:46)
funny that they say more powerful (45:45 - 45:47)
legendary that's so vague unless you (45:46 - 45:49)
know what they're talking about (45:47 - 45:52)
um that means like (45:49 - 45:54)
mewtwo and uh (45:52 - 45:56)
kyogre or garden and (45:54 - 46:00)
shadowrider calorics those are banned (45:56 - 46:02)
you can put together a team without (46:00 - 46:03)
using any of these restricted pokemon to (46:02 - 46:06)
show off your skills uh the the reward (46:03 - 46:08)
is 50 battle points whether you win or (46:06 - 46:12)
lose you can register until june 23rd (46:08 - 46:14)
um through the battle stadium the (46:12 - 46:16)
competition will take place june 23rd to (46:14 - 46:18)
june 26th (46:16 - 46:20)
it's just (46:18 - 46:22)
single battles (46:20 - 46:24)
uh (46:22 - 46:25)
no (46:24 - 46:28)
box legends good like (46:25 - 46:29)
i don't know (46:28 - 46:32)
that's the thing (46:29 - 46:36)
50 battle points does that seem (46:32 - 46:36)
it's cool that you get 50 battle points (46:37 - 46:41)
whether you win or lose (46:39 - 46:44)
but who's like scraping for 50 battle (46:41 - 46:45)
points at this point three years into (46:44 - 46:47)
sword and shield (46:45 - 46:50)
especially when i feel like they (46:47 - 46:52)
you you you don't need the battle points (46:50 - 46:56)
if you're still playing it's (46:52 - 46:56)
what do you need them for (46:56 - 46:59)
fun (46:58 - 47:00)
i mean yeah (46:59 - 47:02)
this is something you enjoy (47:00 - 47:04)
there are people who enjoy this just (47:02 - 47:08)
regardless of what the reward is (47:04 - 47:08)
yeah there are people that like single (47:08 - 47:12)
battles and they want to see where they (47:10 - 47:16)
fall on a tournament situation (47:12 - 47:16)
that that is a thing good good luck to (47:19 - 47:24)
those people that like to sit in stealth (47:22 - 47:27)
rock (47:24 - 47:30)
yeah i know my life (47:27 - 47:30)
craig's secret lover of stealth rock he (47:30 - 47:35)
sets it up for everything you battle i (47:33 - 47:37)
have stealth rocks all over this house (47:35 - 47:39)
you never know when you get hit when you (47:37 - 47:41)
walk through my house (47:39 - 47:43)
uh question of the week (47:41 - 47:46)
i wanna hear the question (47:43 - 47:49)
of the week (47:46 - 47:49)
this is from stephen (47:58 - 48:02)
how has your relationship with pokemon (48:00 - 48:05)
franchise changed since becoming a (48:02 - 48:07)
sometimes sponsored content creator of (48:05 - 48:10)
pokemon (48:07 - 48:10)
uh there's only one person here that can (48:10 - 48:14)
answer that question (48:12 - 48:16)
i've never been sponsored i've never had (48:14 - 48:18)
a sponsored content creator you guys (48:16 - 48:22)
have gotten plenty of niantic tickets (48:18 - 48:22)
from you yes you're the sponsor (48:22 - 48:29)
[Laughter] (48:24 - 48:29)
isaac has offered to annoy to give uh me (48:30 - 48:35)
and will press passes back in the day (48:33 - 48:38)
well that's true so uh of course i only (48:35 - 48:40)
have very positive things to say about (48:38 - 48:42)
the franchise ever since i've become a (48:40 - 48:44)
sometimes sponsored pokemon content (48:42 - 48:47)
creator (48:44 - 48:47)
i don't know what this question means i (48:52 - 48:58)
like pokemon i've always liked pokemon (48:54 - 48:59)
whatever (48:58 - 49:02)
small perks i may have gotten have not (48:59 - 49:05)
impacted my joy of pokemon in one way or (49:02 - 49:07)
the other i feel like this is one of (49:05 - 49:10)
those things where (49:07 - 49:10)
the order order that people think (49:11 - 49:17)
happens is not the order that most (49:13 - 49:18)
people do like (49:17 - 49:20)
you seek out sponsorships for things (49:18 - 49:21)
that you love (49:20 - 49:22)
already (49:21 - 49:25)
so like you're gonna go for a pokemon (49:22 - 49:28)
sponsorship because you love pokemon so (49:25 - 49:29)
unless (49:28 - 49:32)
the company you're working with is hot (49:29 - 49:34)
hot garbage and treats you poorly (49:32 - 49:36)
in general you're you're (49:34 - 49:38)
it's not like they're buying something (49:36 - 49:40)
that doesn't already exist like (49:38 - 49:43)
i i really enjoy pokemon which is why i (49:40 - 49:46)
do this podcast and so we seek out (49:43 - 49:49)
things to help support our love of the (49:46 - 49:51)
field it's not like (49:49 - 49:53)
niantic came to us and said you've never (49:51 - 49:54)
played this game before but we'll give (49:53 - 49:56)
you five thousand dollars to play it and (49:54 - 49:58)
start loving it like it's not that's not (49:56 - 50:00)
the order (49:58 - 50:01)
i mean we've literally been playing (50:00 - 50:06)
pokemon since before youtube twitch etc (50:01 - 50:10)
justin tv or whatever it was existed (50:06 - 50:10)
yeah i think there's like uh (50:10 - 50:14)
some of the perks are nice um (50:14 - 50:21)
and i think it's different than like (50:18 - 50:22)
seeing (50:21 - 50:24)
like big streamers like stream pokemon (50:22 - 50:26)
unite for a day just because they were (50:24 - 50:28)
paid by (50:26 - 50:29)
uh (50:28 - 50:32)
tencent or whoever timmy or the pokemon (50:29 - 50:34)
company to be like hey pokemon unite (50:32 - 50:35)
needs (50:34 - 50:38)
more attraction so you normally pull (50:35 - 50:41)
20 000 people here's money play unite (50:38 - 50:43)
for today that happened that was like a (50:41 - 50:45)
real thing that happened on twitch (50:43 - 50:48)
and they did they played unite for a day (50:45 - 50:49)
and then never played and talked about (50:48 - 50:51)
it again because they collected their (50:49 - 50:52)
paycheck and did what they needed to do (50:51 - 50:54)
and moved on and that's fine i get it (50:52 - 50:56)
collect your paycheck (50:54 - 50:58)
uh play play that video game for that (50:56 - 51:02)
paycheck i would um (50:58 - 51:02)
but uh (51:03 - 51:07)
yeah like i i never got into podcasting (51:04 - 51:10)
with the the goal to like make money or (51:07 - 51:13)
to like get free stuff and like the free (51:10 - 51:14)
stuff (51:13 - 51:16)
it's it's it's that saying of what like (51:14 - 51:18)
the grass is greener always greener on (51:16 - 51:20)
the other side like (51:18 - 51:21)
it (51:20 - 51:23)
i don't even know if that saying applies (51:21 - 51:25)
here but i when i (51:23 - 51:27)
was (51:25 - 51:27)
not doing this full time and i was (51:28 - 51:32)
seeing other people get like free games (51:30 - 51:34)
or controllers or whatnot and now i'm in (51:32 - 51:36)
the position where they send me free (51:34 - 51:39)
games and controllers (51:36 - 51:41)
i can't pay my rent and controllers i (51:39 - 51:44)
just can't like i have so many (51:41 - 51:47)
power a or mad cats or i don't know (51:44 - 51:50)
whoever else makes control mad castles (51:47 - 51:53)
i have so many controllers (51:50 - 51:56)
i get i can't do anything with them like (51:53 - 51:57)
i just have a bunch and it's like it was (51:56 - 51:59)
like very cool at first but now it's (51:57 - 52:02)
like yeah it's (51:59 - 52:02)
there's another controller for the (52:02 - 52:06)
closet i guess uh busted out eventually (52:03 - 52:07)
i mean if will greg comes over i'll try (52:06 - 52:09)
to sneak controllers in there in their (52:07 - 52:11)
bag before they leave because (52:09 - 52:13)
i don't need them anymore (52:11 - 52:16)
um so yeah it's fine i think there there (52:13 - 52:18)
there was stuff that was like (52:16 - 52:22)
flattering like when um pokemon company (52:18 - 52:24)
did those like celebration stuff and (52:22 - 52:26)
they sent me a bunch of celebration (52:24 - 52:28)
things like that was really flattering (52:26 - 52:30)
niantic reaching out being like hey we (52:28 - 52:33)
want to help pay for you to go to (52:30 - 52:36)
um seattle was like jeez i (52:33 - 52:39)
i think of anything it's not even about (52:36 - 52:41)
the money it's it's that like you're (52:39 - 52:43)
doing something right (52:41 - 52:46)
like i'm not sure how i got here but (52:43 - 52:48)
these people at these companies like (52:46 - 52:51)
what i am doing and it's like validation (52:48 - 52:52)
that (52:51 - 52:55)
like the products we are making (52:52 - 52:57)
uh (52:55 - 53:00)
they they like as well as the audience (52:57 - 53:02)
likes oh i should probably also say (53:00 - 53:04)
um (53:02 - 53:06)
oddly enough the pokemon company reached (53:04 - 53:08)
out to me and they are (53:06 - 53:11)
offering to pay my hotel room (53:08 - 53:13)
uh for pokemon worlds (53:11 - 53:16)
in london so that's super exciting that (53:13 - 53:19)
they did that and i'm allowed to say (53:16 - 53:20)
that now (53:19 - 53:22)
um they also were like we're we we can (53:20 - 53:24)
pay for your flight and i was like oh i (53:22 - 53:25)
already booked that (53:24 - 53:26)
and they're like yeah but if you use (53:25 - 53:29)
their website yeah well if you use our (53:26 - 53:31)
website and i was like i already booked (53:29 - 53:34)
that um me and my wife are are coming (53:31 - 53:35)
and they're like well we can't pay for (53:34 - 53:37)
your wife (53:35 - 53:39)
and i was like yeah no that makes that (53:37 - 53:40)
makes sense (53:39 - 53:42)
um (53:40 - 53:44)
and i was like no that's that's fine (53:42 - 53:46)
i'll just i'll keep my flights are (53:44 - 53:47)
direct (53:46 - 53:50)
they're they're i'll just keep that (53:47 - 53:52)
um because like i don't want to be like (53:50 - 53:54)
well i'll save x amount of money and (53:52 - 53:55)
then my wife's on a whole different (53:54 - 53:57)
flight and i'm on a different flight (53:55 - 53:59)
we're going to a different i was like no (53:57 - 54:00)
i think the comfort of sitting next to (53:59 - 54:03)
my wife on an eight-hour flight is is (54:00 - 54:06)
pretty priceless (54:03 - 54:11)
see how we are left out in the cold (54:06 - 54:14)
you don't even have a passport i will by (54:11 - 54:16)
the time worlds comes out i even told (54:14 - 54:19)
you that did you expedite it no (54:16 - 54:22)
i thought i thought they said two months (54:19 - 54:25)
when is worlds (54:22 - 54:26)
two months (54:25 - 54:30)
yeah i will have it the start of august (54:26 - 54:32)
the whole book and book of flight in the (54:30 - 54:33)
hotel yeah (54:32 - 54:35)
i'll tell you flights to uk are way (54:33 - 54:37)
cheaper than flights to ohio i know that (54:35 - 54:39)
for sure are they cheaper than flights (54:37 - 54:41)
to indianapolis because i had to book (54:39 - 54:43)
that (54:41 - 54:45)
yeah i'm sure they are last time i (54:43 - 54:46)
checked the flight for the indy it was (54:45 - 54:49)
700. (54:46 - 54:49)
um so yeah i (54:50 - 54:54)
i would also like to say that even (54:56 - 55:00)
though the pokemon company (54:57 - 55:03)
has sent me cards or niantic has sent me (55:00 - 55:06)
tickets or dna has provided me gems (55:03 - 55:08)
i don't think that has changed my (55:06 - 55:10)
opinion about certain things (55:08 - 55:12)
um (55:10 - 55:14)
you can you can read our youtube (55:12 - 55:15)
comments or or whatnot and people are (55:14 - 55:17)
like wow you guys are so negative on (55:15 - 55:19)
pokemon and it's like (55:17 - 55:21)
we could literally spend (55:19 - 55:24)
45 minutes talking about how great (55:21 - 55:25)
scarlett and violet look and then be (55:24 - 55:28)
like oh that tree that tree looked bad (55:25 - 55:30)
and that that one sentence which is like (55:28 - 55:32)
just a throwaway joke just (55:30 - 55:36)
ruins the 45 minutes of positivity um (55:32 - 55:38)
but yeah you know like even with with (55:36 - 55:40)
pokemon masters and dna providing me (55:38 - 55:43)
gems like there's been plenty of (55:40 - 55:44)
conversations on the show where it's (55:43 - 55:45)
like (55:44 - 55:47)
pokemon masters is not great right now (55:45 - 55:49)
and pokemon master is pretty good (55:47 - 55:51)
uh but there was times where pokemon (55:49 - 55:53)
masters was bad there's time i remember (55:51 - 55:55)
those times good spot right now we're (55:53 - 55:59)
getting a new pair soon i'm excited (55:55 - 56:00)
um (55:59 - 56:03)
so yeah uh (56:00 - 56:04)
i think the other thing (56:03 - 56:08)
the last thing i would say is (56:04 - 56:11)
i i feel like there is that (56:08 - 56:13)
i i think there's a lot of truth to it (56:11 - 56:14)
where (56:13 - 56:15)
you (56:14 - 56:18)
turn your hobby into like a job and then (56:15 - 56:20)
all of a sudden it's like (56:18 - 56:22)
it wears off and the novelty's gone and (56:20 - 56:25)
it's like not fun anymore (56:22 - 56:26)
um (56:25 - 56:27)
do you want to love and you'll never (56:26 - 56:31)
work a day in your life is (56:27 - 56:31)
uh and i've never (56:32 - 56:38)
i've never felt that with pokemon (56:35 - 56:38)
so (56:41 - 56:43)
yeah i've never i've never felt felt (56:43 - 56:48)
that with uh (56:45 - 56:48)
the last like 11 years of doing this (56:48 - 56:52)
question of the week uh pokemon of the (56:55 - 56:57)
week (56:56 - 57:01)
oh gee uh okay so last week's pokemon i (56:57 - 57:04)
had planned on doing one pokemon but (57:01 - 57:06)
then i couldn't do it and then i (57:04 - 57:08)
referenced a fossil pokemon that (57:06 - 57:11)
recently became available (57:08 - 57:12)
and this weird thing about being the (57:11 - 57:14)
only one of its type that a pokemon (57:12 - 57:16)
introduced in the same generation it was (57:14 - 57:18)
it was introduced got an alternate form (57:16 - 57:19)
recently it had had the same type but (57:18 - 57:22)
switched (57:19 - 57:22)
they that's all you needed (57:23 - 57:28)

what fossil pokemon have recently been (57:38 - 57:43)

tyrant is correct (57:43 - 57:47)

uh i did i did the thing that i (58:35 - 58:39)
that that i hate (58:40 - 58:46)
is i i i purposely got myself 7k eggs (58:42 - 58:47)
because that's where archan and tortuga (58:46 - 58:48)
was (58:47 - 58:51)
and then i used a (58:48 - 58:53)
a bunch of incubators (58:51 - 58:55)
because i was hoarding incubators you (58:53 - 58:58)
bought okay and i hatched (58:55 - 59:01)
nothing but shield ons and cranny dose (58:58 - 59:04)
which are they were just around my feet (59:01 - 59:06)
i could i could see them and catch them (59:04 - 59:09)
and then i i walked i put the effort in (59:06 - 59:12)
i did what niantic wanted i walked and (59:09 - 59:14)
then i just hatched more of them (59:12 - 59:16)
and it didn't feel good it was not a (59:14 - 59:19)
good experience it was actually very bad (59:16 - 59:21)
it made me feel bad (59:19 - 59:23)
that i (59:21 - 59:25)
made room for these eggs and then i put (59:23 - 59:27)
them in incubators and then they were (59:25 - 59:29)
just the same things that i was catching (59:27 - 59:32)
welcome to pokemon go it was not fun i (59:29 - 59:34)
did i did get shiny shield on the (59:32 - 59:37)
channel visited a new area of the city (59:34 - 59:40)
i saw the giant spoon yeah i still have (59:37 - 59:42)
not seen the giant spoon i've been here (59:40 - 59:44)
almost three years (59:42 - 59:46)
let's go yeah let's go we can get lunch (59:44 - 59:48)
we can see the spoon we come back play (59:46 - 59:50)
mario party (59:48 - 59:54)
that's a lot to ask for one afternoon (59:50 - 59:54)
afternoon that's a whole thing are you (59:54 - 59:57)
ready for this (59:56 - 60:01)
do you have opinions tyrant trivia (59:57 - 60:01)
i love the shiny i know that does it (60:03 - 60:07)
have a shovel (60:05 - 60:09)
yeah it has a shirt gen 6. (60:07 - 60:11)
tyront has some similarities with amora (60:09 - 60:13)
they're both rock type introducing gen (60:11 - 60:15)
6. they share the same best base stat (60:13 - 60:19)
total of 362. they both evolve at level (60:15 - 60:20)
39. (60:19 - 60:23)
although tyrant involves during the uh (60:20 - 60:26)
during the day uh tyrant evolves at day (60:23 - 60:29)
instead of during night um tyrant is the (60:26 - 60:31)
only pokemon that is type combination (60:29 - 60:33)
rock dragon (60:31 - 60:36)
uh it is the only rock type pokemon in (60:33 - 60:38)
the dragon egg group and it was (60:36 - 60:40)
designed by hitoshi (60:38 - 60:41)
uh (60:40 - 60:43)
arig ariga (60:41 - 60:45)
i think yeah that's close (60:43 - 60:47)
also note that in pokemon go you can (60:45 - 60:50)
only evolve tyron during the day (60:47 - 60:51)
that (60:50 - 60:53)
remains (60:51 - 60:55)
the shiny for this (60:53 - 60:57)
it's so good (60:55 - 60:59)
the shuffle is very good but the shiny (60:57 - 61:00)
is excellent (60:59 - 61:04)
all right this week's pokemon pay (61:00 - 61:07)
very close attention (61:04 - 61:09)
because (61:07 - 61:12)
some people have recently been asking (61:09 - 61:14)

and then somebody will say there's one (61:14 - 61:20)
here we go (61:17 - 61:22)

fish effect type and is a level 4 (61:30 - 61:35)
monster its effect text feeds once per (61:32 - 61:38)
turn if this card would be destroyed by (61:35 - 61:40)
