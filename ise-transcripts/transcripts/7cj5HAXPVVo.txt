little bit of but before we get to all (2:06 - 2:11)
of that we're gonna do a mini pokemon of (2:08 - 2:15)
the week right here very unorthodox that (2:11 - 2:17)
is very strange I was gonna say I don't (2:15 - 2:19)
want to read the the pokemons name but (2:17 - 2:21)

it feeds on the blood of both Pokemon (2:35 - 2:42)
and humans it is capable of it's capable (2:39 - 2:46)
of drinking over ten ounces that's 300 (2:42 - 2:49)
milliliters in Canada of blood in one (2:46 - 2:50)
sitting (2:49 - 2:55)
look golbat drinks so much blood that (2:50 - 2:57)
it's blood type will change to that of (2:55 - 3:02)
the victim following a feed no (2:57 - 3:05)
occasionally gorging itself to the (3:02 - 3:07)
extent that it might become too heavy to (3:05 - 3:10)
fly leaving it vulnerable in turn gold (3:07 - 3:14)
that is nocturnal and confound be can be (3:10 - 3:17)
found quite easily in caves you can't (3:14 - 3:19)
just use the word gorging in reference (3:17 - 3:23)
to blood just so casually I I didn't (3:19 - 3:25)
think it was possible to find yet (3:23 - 3:28)
another reason to hate the Zubat line (3:25 - 3:32)
but congratulations folks we found it (3:28 - 3:36)
500 tragedy a couple of listeners both (3:32 - 3:39)

this is from comicbook.com Magikarp Jump (5:53 - 5:59)
rolled out a new update last night (5:58 - 6:03)
adding two new Pokemon various other (5:59 - 6:04)
improvements to the game the update also (6:03 - 6:07)
adds four new types of Magikarp a new (6:04 - 6:09)
league for players to conquer possibly (6:07 - 6:11)
the most important update in addition to (6:09 - 6:14)
the new ultra League and a raised in (6:11 - 6:15)
maximum level cap for both player and (6:14 - 6:17)
their Magikarp if you grinded all the (6:15 - 6:19)
way through the previous leagues the new (6:17 - 6:21)
ultra League should provide something to (6:19 - 6:23)
do instead of beating the same expertly (6:21 - 6:26)
over and over the new update also (6:23 - 6:28)
improves the speed of the game removing (6:26 - 6:30)
some of the downtime between League (6:28 - 6:32)
battles you can also now skip every (6:30 - 6:34)
cutscene to go back to feeding and (6:32 - 6:35)
training your Magikarp in a hurry (6:34 - 6:38)
beating Ultra League will unlock the new (6:35 - 6:41)
pro old rod that will allow players to (6:38 - 6:43)
catch more Magikarp patterns the new (6:41 - 6:46)
Magikarp all have distinctive forehead (6:43 - 6:47)
pattern (6:46 - 6:49)
that come in white and gray variants (6:47 - 6:52)
mudkip and Evy were both brought to the (6:49 - 6:55)
game as support Pokemon this means that (6:52 - 6:57)
they will use their special abilities to (6:55 - 6:59)
help push magic up to greater heights (6:57 - 7:01)
Mudkip will give out an item every three (6:59 - 7:05)
hours while Evie's special ability will (7:01 - 7:06)
guarantee that magikarps a next training (7:05 - 7:09)
session will earn an amazing effort (7:06 - 7:13)
result in boosted JP gained Mudkip can (7:09 - 7:14)
be earned by beating the new ultra (7:13 - 7:16)
League and Eevee is available for (7:14 - 7:17)
purchase for four hundred diamonds in (7:16 - 7:20)
the game store a new Clefairy dalvik 500 (7:17 - 7:22)
according to unless there's a new update (7:20 - 7:25)
that reduced its price I'm looking at (7:22 - 7:26)
right now that it is 500 for Eevee (7:25 - 7:29)
breaking-news comicbook.com (7:26 - 7:33)
wrong on diamond count a nucleus a new (7:29 - 7:35)
collaborative decoration item can also (7:33 - 7:37)
be purchased from the store Travis will (7:35 - 7:39)
check the price here but we got 350 (7:37 - 7:42)
diamonds which will give Magikarp a 20% (7:39 - 7:44)
boost and JP from all other Pokemon (7:42 - 7:45)
skills that is correct (7:44 - 7:47)
finally two new food types added a (7:45 - 7:50)
castelia stone and a magic art biscuit (7:47 - 7:53)
are now available for purchase oh and (7:50 - 7:55)
also two new training exercise one one (7:53 - 7:58)
that features Magikarp flopping against (7:55 - 8:00)
a golem they don't say what the other (7:58 - 8:03)
training exercise is one is golem push (8:00 - 8:06)
and the other is soccer ball slam or (8:03 - 8:08)
soccer ball crush or whatever so the (8:06 - 8:11)
golem one is the same as the well I mean (8:08 - 8:14)
they're all the same that's all and then (8:11 - 8:17)
you get JP but the golem one takes the (8:14 - 8:22)
form of the dwell bull door and whatever (8:17 - 8:25)
the third one is push one or forretress (8:22 - 8:28)
yeah well is it as a heavy Pokemon (8:25 - 8:29)
sitting in front of you and your magic (8:28 - 8:31)
are plops against it to push it as far (8:29 - 8:33)
as it can the golem wants the same as (8:31 - 8:34)
those and then the soccer (8:33 - 8:37)
I think it's soccer ball slam let me see (8:34 - 8:38)
it is called (8:37 - 8:43)
soccer ball smash soccer ball smash that (8:38 - 8:47)
one is just like pokeball smash and the (8:43 - 8:51)
unfortunately named ball smash yeah (8:47 - 8:53)
yikes (8:51 - 8:53)
it's just like those where there's a (8:54 - 9:00)
ball of some variety sitting in one of (8:57 - 9:01)
those like (9:00 - 9:03)
it's a device that sort of mimics like (9:01 - 9:06)
like a tennis court tennis ball launcher (9:03 - 9:11)
yeah yeah cauldre turns against them to (9:06 - 9:15)
knock them away so I got pretty burned (9:11 - 9:17)
out a Magikarp jump I went down to (9:15 - 9:19)
playing once or twice a week I've been (9:17 - 9:22)
playing once a day now ever since the (9:19 - 9:24)
update I I'm really satisfied with (9:22 - 9:27)
especially more than anything else the (9:24 - 9:30)
speed changes but yes Travis tell me (9:27 - 9:31)
tell me how you feel about this update (9:30 - 9:33)
I'm curious about that to you because I (9:31 - 9:36)
completely stopped playing and I haven't (9:33 - 9:39)
touched it in weeks because of how slow (9:36 - 9:42)
it was the speed-up updates are pretty (9:39 - 9:44)
great I mean I would argue we're not (9:42 - 9:47)
there yet and what it needs to be for (9:44 - 9:49)
example the best it could be faster yeah (9:47 - 9:53)
the best part of the speed updates is (9:49 - 9:56)
that before when you went back to a (9:53 - 10:00)
league so the way it works is even if (9:56 - 10:03)
your previous Magikarp went all the way (10:00 - 10:06)
up to say the and beat the second to (10:03 - 10:09)
last Magikarp in that you know challenge (10:06 - 10:12)
run of that league and then lost to the (10:09 - 10:15)
final boss of that league your next (10:12 - 10:18)
Magikarp can't just start on the final (10:15 - 10:20)
boss has to be every single Magikarp (10:18 - 10:22)
along the way the game has always had (10:20 - 10:24)
the ability to hit a skip button that (10:22 - 10:27)
makes it so that you skip the majority (10:24 - 10:29)
of the won't when you skip all of the (10:27 - 10:31)
cutscene that shows the jumping happen (10:29 - 10:34)
and it skips right to the result but but (10:31 - 10:35)
two things are changed now one the (10:34 - 10:37)
animation of the screen that comes up (10:35 - 10:39)
that saying how many coins and (10:37 - 10:41)
experience you won I think that's a (10:39 - 10:44)
little faster and two importantly the (10:41 - 10:48)
sort of congratulations animation is (10:44 - 10:51)
like two or three times faster before it (10:48 - 10:54)
would be like congratulations you won (10:51 - 10:57)
then there's confetti then the next (10:54 - 10:59)
pokeball opens signifying that you are (10:57 - 11:01)
able to challenge the next person and (10:59 - 11:03)
then your character slowly walks to it (11:01 - 11:07)
now if that walk is brutal the walk is (11:03 - 11:09)
very brutal now if you hit skip the (11:07 - 11:12)
confetti happens as it skips to your (11:09 - 11:14)
character is already like halfway there (11:12 - 11:14)
your (11:14 - 11:16)
character walks a little faster than (11:14 - 11:18)
usual and the confetti in the pokeball (11:16 - 11:21)
open at the same time so it's much much (11:18 - 11:23)
quicker and much more tolerable same (11:21 - 11:26)
thing goes for events so in a previous (11:23 - 11:28)
episode of the show Steve and I (11:26 - 11:30)
complained about the many wise words (11:28 - 11:34)
event which man is a joke event where (11:30 - 11:36)
doesn't do anything it's a funny joke (11:34 - 11:38)
the first time that the you know the is (11:36 - 11:40)
he a professor I guess he's just the old (11:38 - 11:43)
man yes the mayor I think of the mayor (11:40 - 11:45)
that's yeah mayor comes (11:43 - 11:47)
yeah that's you're right he comes along (11:45 - 11:49)
and says like oh you know when I was (11:47 - 11:51)
your age and he gives you advice that is (11:49 - 11:53)
meaningless and it's funny the first (11:51 - 11:55)
time when you see nothing happened but (11:53 - 11:57)
then it doesn't only happen once it (11:55 - 11:59)
happens multiple times now you can skip (11:57 - 12:01)
events so many wise words still happens (11:59 - 12:03)
but if you've gotten that event before (12:01 - 12:05)
you can just hit the skip button and (12:03 - 12:09)
let's get past it thank God it's not (12:05 - 12:12)
perfect because battling a league is (12:09 - 12:14)
still incredibly slow if it's your first (12:12 - 12:17)
time through that league I don't know (12:14 - 12:21)
why they don't just have the increased (12:17 - 12:23)
and animation walking from one place to (12:21 - 12:27)
another all of the time and and not just (12:23 - 12:30)
when you happen to want to skip the the (12:27 - 12:32)
sort of challenge animation you can't (12:30 - 12:34)
skip the the main animation of the (12:32 - 12:36)
challenge if it's your first time (12:34 - 12:39)
battling that magikarp so you can't make (12:36 - 12:42)
the walking animation faster if it's (12:39 - 12:44)
your first time through that league so (12:42 - 12:47)
that's infuriating but like baby stops (12:44 - 12:49)
folks I do have a question for you so (12:47 - 12:52)
like when I was going through whatever (12:49 - 12:55)
was before the heel league I can't (12:52 - 12:57)
remember was it like great League or (12:55 - 12:58)
what at watch one are you talking about (12:57 - 13:00)
wellness league yeah the one that (12:58 - 13:02)
whatever what what league was before he (13:00 - 13:05)
league there's healing like quick league (13:02 - 13:07)
or fastly yeah yeah yeah it's fast (13:05 - 13:09)
league so I know (13:07 - 13:11)
so before Healey got released which was (13:09 - 13:14)
the the first major update to the game I (13:11 - 13:20)
was two gyms away from beating the game (13:14 - 13:22)
and not having quote-unquote beating the (13:20 - 13:24)
game and not having anything to do I (13:22 - 13:27)
think they call that expert league when (13:24 - 13:28)
I did finally beat (13:27 - 13:31)
fast League or whatever that league was (13:28 - 13:32)
called then he league was already there (13:31 - 13:34)
and I went into he league and now I'm (13:32 - 13:36)
almost done with he league and of course (13:34 - 13:39)
I'm like two gyms away two battles away (13:36 - 13:41)
from being done with he league they (13:39 - 13:43)
released this update for this new league (13:41 - 13:46)
so again I don't experience expert (13:43 - 13:48)
league but everything I heard is expert (13:46 - 13:50)
league is just nothing it's just (13:48 - 13:53)
pointless battles is is that well I mean (13:50 - 13:56)
you get experience and gold okay but (13:53 - 14:00)
like you know diamonds diamonds yeah but (13:56 - 14:02)
do you get that every time you go (14:00 - 14:05)
through the league no but you there are (14:02 - 14:07)
like three stages of the expert league (14:05 - 14:09)
you get it the first time you go through (14:07 - 14:12)
each stage of the expert league but then (14:09 - 14:15)
once you've beaten the third well I (14:12 - 14:18)
don't know anymore cuz I've I'm back at (14:15 - 14:19)
the first stage of the expert lead now (14:18 - 14:21)
that the update has happened so it might (14:19 - 14:23)
be more than three now but at least in (14:21 - 14:24)
the last update there are three stages (14:23 - 14:26)
to the expert league essentially like (14:24 - 14:28)
expert league one expert liek to an (14:26 - 14:31)
expert league three and the first time (14:28 - 14:35)
you go through one of those stages you (14:31 - 14:38)
get diamonds but then once you're at (14:35 - 14:40)
once you've beaten expert league three (14:38 - 14:43)
you just do expert league 3 through (14:40 - 14:45)
again you don't get diamonds but you get (14:43 - 14:48)
gold and you get experience ok and (14:45 - 14:51)
there's no badge correct interesting but (14:48 - 14:53)
now you have a whole new league to go (14:51 - 14:55)
through Travis oh I already did (14:53 - 14:57)
oh you went through it all ultra League (14:55 - 15:01)
yeah oh I'm on expert League one so now (14:57 - 15:03)
that you're back in expert league again (15:01 - 15:05)
after doing a whole nother week do you (15:03 - 15:09)
get diamonds or no yes but it's not the (15:05 - 15:12)
same expert League before when I did at (15:09 - 15:15)
expert league the all of the challengers (15:12 - 15:19)
were not as buff like know now that the (15:15 - 15:22)
level cap has increased the the Jaypee (15:19 - 15:25)
of all of the fish in the of the (15:22 - 15:27)
Magikarp and the expert League have (15:25 - 15:30)
increased and so accordingly you do get (15:27 - 15:33)
diamonds when you hit those levels those (15:30 - 15:35)
challengers whose number is divisible by (15:33 - 15:39)
5 so I lost out on easy diamonds because (15:35 - 15:40)
I didn't make you to the expert League (15:39 - 15:42)
before (15:40 - 15:45)
this new league arrived that's correct (15:42 - 15:47)
unless I don't know how it works maybe (15:45 - 15:48)
when you go it won't (15:47 - 15:51)
I don't know who knows the the in-depth (15:48 - 15:54)
strategy of magic are chunk huh so now (15:51 - 15:56)
that you have so many questions so now (15:54 - 15:58)
that you've beaten ultra League and (15:56 - 16:01)
you're back to expert league are you (15:58 - 16:02)
going to continue playing because it (16:01 - 16:04)
sounded like before the update you are (16:02 - 16:09)
about to retire your cells are more (16:04 - 16:12)
tolerable now that the speed is (16:09 - 16:15)
increased it's so much more tolerable I (16:12 - 16:16)
don't know if this was answered in a (16:15 - 16:18)
previous episode but the burning (16:16 - 16:21)
question I have is have you spent any (16:18 - 16:22)
money (16:21 - 16:26)
no all right I spent probably 5 bucks or (16:22 - 16:29)
I think this you bet you did the special (16:26 - 16:32)
when they first watched yeah but it's (16:29 - 16:34)
good to hear that you can like not (16:32 - 16:36)
easily I guess but get through (16:34 - 16:38)
everything without having to spend (16:36 - 16:41)
anything yeah I never even really felt (16:38 - 16:44)
the temptation to spend it's not like (16:41 - 16:45)
one of those free-to-play games where (16:44 - 16:47)
it's like I don't know I I didn't feel (16:45 - 16:49)
like spending money would make me have (16:47 - 16:52)
any more fun so I didn't alright fair (16:49 - 16:54)
enough I also think there's a hard cap (16:52 - 16:55)
in what you can spend I don't think you (16:54 - 16:57)
can spend more than $100 in the game (16:55 - 17:00)
listen if I spend $100 on Magikarp jump (16:57 - 17:03)
but you can get that I give you the (17:00 - 17:05)
ability to take my phone away from me (17:03 - 17:07)
permanently you get the diamond miner if (17:05 - 17:10)
you spend I think you have to spend $60 (17:07 - 17:13)
and you can get the diamond miner $60 (17:10 - 17:16)
it's like it's it yeah magic rope jump (17:13 - 17:18)
so don't play video here you can't you (17:16 - 17:20)
get that without paying out money though (17:18 - 17:23)
you can't just diamonds you have to so (17:20 - 17:25)
the only way you can buy the diamond (17:23 - 17:29)
miner is by using the the pokey bucks (17:25 - 17:32)
and the only way to get pokey bucks is (17:29 - 17:35)
yeah the tickets is by spending money (17:32 - 17:39)
maybe it's well it's whatever maybe it's (17:35 - 17:42)
not maybe it's $40 I think you have to (17:39 - 17:43)
get the diamond miner it's whatever the (17:42 - 17:45)
the final purchases which I think might (17:43 - 17:48)
be Magikarp research right here menu (17:45 - 17:52)
purchase after five trade ends of 2,500 (17:48 - 17:53)
tickets you can get the diamond miner (17:52 - 17:55)
which is a hundred diamonds per day (17:53 - 17:57)
so you would have to spell out of (17:55 - 17:59)
diamonds that's a lot of diamonds you'd (17:57 - 18:02)
have to spend $40 you would have to buy (17:59 - 18:08)
the $35 option which gives you 2150 (18:02 - 18:10)
tickets and then you would have to spend (18:08 - 18:13)
the $5 option which gives you 250 (18:10 - 18:17)
tickets which then equals 2,500 tickets (18:13 - 18:19)
and then you can get the diamond miner (18:17 - 18:22)
and then you also get you get five (18:19 - 18:26)
trading so does three 3lp restores one (18:22 - 18:28)
powerup and then one sec of coins and (18:26 - 18:31)
then you get the diamond miner so $40 (18:28 - 18:34)
per that's that's $20 cheaper than other (18:31 - 18:37)
Triple A games that you can buy that's I (18:34 - 18:40)
mean this isn't a Triple A game still (18:37 - 18:45)
feel weird about a and B I still feel (18:40 - 18:47)
weird about spending $40 on a mobile (18:45 - 18:51)
game then you don't there's a there's no (18:47 - 18:54)
real like I the only reason you would (18:51 - 18:56)
really spend money on this is if you (18:54 - 18:58)
felt like you really needed all of the (18:56 - 19:01)
decorations and all of the support (18:58 - 19:04)
Pokemon I feel like that that's that's (19:01 - 19:07)
why you would spend the money is because (19:04 - 19:08)
I know that's what I'm saying I don't (19:07 - 19:11)
feel like that it's possible to get all (19:08 - 19:14)
the decorations without constant playing (19:11 - 19:17)
of the game yeah yeah I definitely agree (19:14 - 19:19)
like if you're trying to get all of the (19:17 - 19:21)
decorations and all the support Pokemon (19:19 - 19:23)
I can see why you would spend money I (19:21 - 19:25)
don't really care I'm just gonna get the (19:23 - 19:27)
ones that by you know just reading their (19:25 - 19:29)
descriptions think are the best like the (19:27 - 19:32)
next one I'm gonna get is Ganga like I (19:29 - 19:35)
already have the ones that I bought with (19:32 - 19:37)
diamonds that I earned in the game are (19:35 - 19:41)
meows which I pro or note me off you get (19:37 - 19:44)
from being a league so I have I bought (19:41 - 19:49)
like Lytton slowpoke and greninja and (19:44 - 19:51)
then the next one I'm gonna get is (19:49 - 19:53)
Gengar because I'm trying to make it (19:51 - 19:56)
such that I I'm sort of this sort of (19:53 - 19:58)
different ways you could go about (19:56 - 20:00)
playing the game I suppose one way is to (19:58 - 20:03)
try to maximize just things that give (20:00 - 20:06)
you coins so you would like max out like (20:03 - 20:08)
a Rowlett but what I want to do is just (20:06 - 20:09)
like (20:08 - 20:12)
blazed through generations of magic (20:09 - 20:13)
harps as quickly as possible and just (20:12 - 20:15)
earned coins that way by having them (20:13 - 20:18)
fight the league so once I get Gengar (20:15 - 20:22)
strat is gonna be all of my pokemon will (20:18 - 20:23)
have their support pokemon will have (20:22 - 20:26)
their abilities ready click greninja I (20:23 - 20:29)
get however many hundred million JP from (20:26 - 20:35)
that then I use slowpoke which returns (20:29 - 20:39)
one random support pokemons ability to (20:35 - 20:41)
being activated and since the only one (20:39 - 20:43)
whose ability isn't activated would be (20:41 - 20:45)
greninja at that point it's going to be (20:43 - 20:46)
greninja (20:45 - 20:49)
it can I hit games are it can't do (20:46 - 20:51)
itself now that would be a hilarious (20:49 - 20:55)
loop yeah and that's such a good (20:51 - 20:57)
strategy already I'm really excited and (20:55 - 20:59)
then he hit Gengar which increases the (20:57 - 21:02)
Jaypee you get for a brief period of (20:59 - 21:04)
time I think it's like by 50% over the (21:02 - 21:06)
next hour or something or maybe it's (21:04 - 21:08)
less than an hour and then I hit cringe (21:06 - 21:10)
again and I get however many million (21:08 - 21:13)
times 1.5 because of Gengar then I hit (21:10 - 21:15)
Litton and I get however many million (21:13 - 21:17)
times 1.5 because a gengar (21:15 - 21:19)
and then I hit Pikachu and I get however (21:17 - 21:22)
many million times 1.5 and I do all my (21:19 - 21:25)
trainings and then I hit Piplup get a (21:22 - 21:28)
training back and maybe hit Mudkip and (21:25 - 21:29)
maybe get a training so doesn't do (21:28 - 21:31)
another trading training and then (21:29 - 21:33)
they're in one sitting I've completely (21:31 - 21:36)
gotten a magic carpet - it's full - it's (21:33 - 21:39)
another level can you write that down (21:36 - 21:45)
somewhere I don't know if it's even the (21:39 - 21:48)
best rap but I can certainly get (21:45 - 21:50)
something I'll tell you it's the best (21:48 - 21:52)
strat I've heard because it's the only (21:50 - 21:56)
strata it has to be golden speaking of (21:52 - 21:59)
spending money in mobile games Pokemon (21:56 - 22:02)
go has now earned a total of 1.2 billion (21:59 - 22:06)
dollars in revenue across 750 2 million (22:02 - 22:06)
downloads (22:06 - 22:09)
according to app topia this article is (22:06 - 22:13)
off VentureBeat comm f topia is a NAPA (22:09 - 22:15)
telogen startup based in boston its (22:13 - 22:18)
total revenues for 2016 pokemon goes (22:15 - 22:21)
were 950 million (22:18 - 22:23)
so while 2017 made (22:21 - 22:25)
TV app making as many headlines in (22:23 - 22:27)
mainstream news the pocket monster (22:25 - 22:30)
catcher is still still has plenty of (22:27 - 22:31)
traction (22:30 - 22:35)
according to app topia 57.4% of the (22:31 - 22:38)
games players are male while 38 percent (22:35 - 22:41)
are Millennials ages 19 through 34 (22:38 - 22:44)
Pokemon go still attracts plenty of (22:41 - 22:47)
younger players with thirty two point (22:44 - 22:50)
five percent of its users being 18 years (22:47 - 22:53)
or younger Millennials can't buy houses (22:50 - 22:55)
because they're playing Pokemon go oh my (22:53 - 22:59)
god how much money have you sent in the (22:55 - 23:05)
Pokemon go uh I don't know you remember (22:59 - 23:06)
when I said I can't see spending forty (23:05 - 23:08)
dollars a mobile game oh I know that's (23:06 - 23:11)
why this transition was beautiful (23:08 - 23:13)
possibly the best transition I think (23:11 - 23:21)
I've done listen it it's it's very (23:13 - 23:23)
regrettable how many houses do you own (23:21 - 23:27)
out of made out of avocado toasted and (23:23 - 23:29)
one other one of the things are (23:27 - 23:32)
Millennials killing uh they're killing (23:29 - 23:35)
computers well I I saw this this morning (23:32 - 23:37)
Millennials are killing sit down eat (23:35 - 23:40)
restaurants like Applebee's or Buffalo (23:37 - 23:42)
Wild Wings good riddance (23:40 - 23:46)
prior to Pokemon go fest (23:42 - 23:50)
I spent seventy dollars in Pokemon go I (23:46 - 23:54)
believe I spent $20 on the very first (23:50 - 23:57)
day which I felt was needed for me to (23:54 - 24:01)
properly report on the game and seeing (23:57 - 24:04)
what money could get you I think since (24:01 - 24:08)
then I spent $10 $20 and then another (24:04 - 24:11)
and maybe two more sets of ten or one (24:08 - 24:14)
more set of 20 I looked through my app a (24:11 - 24:17)
purchase history and then because I (24:14 - 24:21)
secured a Pokemon go fest ticket and (24:17 - 24:24)
because I plan on going I spent $40 (24:21 - 24:28)
recently mostly because I knew 20 of (24:24 - 24:30)
those dollars would go to increasing my (24:28 - 24:36)
bag size from 1000 to 1500 and for me I (24:30 - 24:38)
I mean I don't need to defend my (24:36 - 24:40)
purchase I feel good about it just not (24:38 - 24:41)
throwing away stuff and being able to (24:40 - 24:43)
hold more stuff makes me feel way better (24:41 - 24:46)
than being like stressed out of like I (24:43 - 24:50)
have 200 pokeballs but I don't want to (24:46 - 24:51)
throw those pokeballs away because of (24:50 - 24:53)
the Pokemon go Plus burns through (24:51 - 24:54)
pokeballs and I don't want to throw my (24:53 - 24:55)
potions away because though I'm doing (24:54 - 24:58)
gyms a lot more I don't throw my revise (24:55 - 25:00)
away because I'm battling at gyms a lot (24:58 - 25:02)
more so just having more bank space (25:00 - 25:04)
makes me feel really good and then their (25:02 - 25:07)
leftover money I will be using for when (25:04 - 25:11)
I go to Pokemon go fest so I have like (25:07 - 25:14)
2500 coins still left I don't know that (25:11 - 25:16)
I want to know this but wait where can (25:14 - 25:18)
you look at your at Purchase History (25:16 - 25:21)
it might be easiest on a computer that's (25:18 - 25:22)
how I always do it (25:21 - 25:25)
you just go to iTunes and then you go to (25:22 - 25:28)
you account info and then you hit (25:25 - 25:30)
purchases and since Pokemon go is only a (25:28 - 25:32)
year old you just have to look for the (25:30 - 25:35)
last year of purchases in iTunes I don't (25:32 - 25:37)
know that I actually want to do that (25:35 - 25:39)
maybe I don't know that I need to (25:37 - 25:42)
subject myself to that Travis has been a (25:39 - 25:45)
full week since the update I know you (25:42 - 25:47)
were dabbling with Pokemon go a little (25:45 - 25:49)
bit are you still into it as this update (25:47 - 25:50)
changed your mind are you playing more (25:49 - 25:53)
Magikarp jumped is taking everyone I (25:50 - 25:56)
just been jumping for joy I haven't (25:53 - 25:58)
really been playing Pokemon go don't (25:56 - 26:01)
play Magic a drum so much now that it's (25:58 - 26:05)
a slightly better game I I've been (26:01 - 26:07)
playing it almost exclusively over (26:05 - 26:09)
pokemon go you heard it here first magic (26:07 - 26:12)
harbour jump better than Pokemon go take (26:09 - 26:16)
them actually pretty much actually maybe (26:12 - 26:19)
I've been playing a lot of Pokemon go I (26:16 - 26:23)
try I have gone three or four weeks (26:19 - 26:26)
hitting my hitting both my pokey stop am (26:23 - 26:30)
i catching streaks my pokedex is over (26:26 - 26:32)
200 now I just told you the amount of (26:30 - 26:36)
money I've spent Myka and I did some (26:32 - 26:40)
raiding yesterday we did six or seven (26:36 - 26:41)
raids in a row Myka do you ought to talk (26:40 - 26:42)
about that experience (26:41 - 26:46)
I lost a Terry editar that's the (26:42 - 26:49)
experience I was very salty but I got a (26:46 - 26:52)
muck so that's cool it's it's been fun (26:49 - 26:57)
like I I also have hit my catch and stop (26:52 - 27:00)
goal like streak for I don't know three (26:57 - 27:02)
three weeks or whatever in a row for (27:00 - 27:04)
three or four weeks and I don't think I (27:02 - 27:07)
ever did that when I was originally like (27:04 - 27:10)
when I was first playing this is (27:07 - 27:13)
definitely the most I've played since I (27:10 - 27:15)
stopped playing last year I've had like (27:13 - 27:18)
a huge increase in the Pokemon I have in (27:15 - 27:21)
my pokedex and that's been really fun (27:18 - 27:23)
it's like every day is like three or (27:21 - 27:25)
four new entries I don't know it's just (27:23 - 27:26)
it's been good (27:25 - 27:28)
i I've enjoyed it a lot and it's gotten (27:26 - 27:29)
me out of the house a lot which is (27:28 - 27:32)
really like to me has been in (27:29 - 27:34)
because by I work from home so I don't (27:32 - 27:39)
ever leave the house I like it's rare (27:34 - 27:42)
that I put pants on so it's getting me (27:39 - 27:45)
out every day into the sunlight I was (27:42 - 27:47)
like Micah tell me about the raids in (27:45 - 27:49)
Pokemon go and you missed the whole (27:47 - 27:51)
interaction we had with like three (27:49 - 27:53)
strangers oh yeah that's right I forgot (27:51 - 27:57)
about those guys yeah I could I could (27:53 - 27:59)
say that all right that's like kind of (27:57 - 28:02)
frequent though right like we tend to (27:59 - 28:05)
see people a lot more frequently like (28:02 - 28:07)
out rating like even yesterday we went (28:05 - 28:11)
to a mall here Mayfair and there was a (28:07 - 28:12)
we were just looking for Ray it's (28:11 - 28:14)
driving around looking for raids and we (28:12 - 28:16)
found one at the mall so we stopped at (28:14 - 28:17)
the mall and we walked to like where it (28:16 - 28:20)
was and there's a mom and her son (28:17 - 28:23)
outside where the raid was happening (28:20 - 28:25)
just just playing and we at first we (28:23 - 28:28)
like all that moms just on her phone and (28:25 - 28:31)
then we heard them discussing Pokemon (28:28 - 28:33)
ghosts rats together but the best part (28:31 - 28:36)
was the mom was playing Pokemon go the (28:33 - 28:40)
little kid wasn't correct and seemed (28:36 - 28:42)
very impatient with like mom taking so (28:40 - 28:45)
long at the raid what was really cool (28:42 - 28:47)
was yesterday when we were done at (28:45 - 28:48)
Mayfair and we were out looking for (28:47 - 28:51)
raids we pulled over to a church and (28:48 - 28:53)
there was a mock raid that was the muck (28:51 - 28:57)
that Micah needed it's it's me Irene and (28:53 - 29:00)
Micah in a car or you know we're in a (28:57 - 29:01)
parking spot in front of this church (29:00 - 29:05)
doing this raid and we see that two (29:01 - 29:06)
other people are in the raid so (29:05 - 29:10)
naturally you look around and we see two (29:06 - 29:14)
dudes vaping in a truck in the in the (29:10 - 29:16)
church parking lot we were like that (29:14 - 29:20)
that has to be them and so we finished (29:16 - 29:22)
the raid and they they as soon as the (29:20 - 29:25)
raids done and the Pokemon is caught I (29:22 - 29:27)
think I think everyone caught the muck (29:25 - 29:30)
you see the car slowly back out and like (29:27 - 29:32)
kind of pull in front of us because we (29:30 - 29:33)
were near the entrance of the church and (29:32 - 29:36)
they do a little wave and then I do a (29:33 - 29:38)
little wave and then I was like ah screw (29:36 - 29:41)
it and I pulled out my window and I was (29:38 - 29:43)
like hey did you guys catch that muck (29:41 - 29:45)
and they're like yeah I was like are you (29:43 - 29:47)
gonna do more raids and they were like (29:45 - 29:49)
yeah yeah we are and I was like well (29:47 - 29:51)
there's like five of us if we can (29:49 - 29:53)
probably do level 3 or level four raids (29:51 - 29:56)
cuz luck is a level 2 raid so it it's (29:53 - 29:59)
pretty easy to do a level 2 solo if (29:56 - 30:01)
you're if you're high enough level so (29:59 - 30:04)
they were like hey we'll just follow you (30:01 - 30:05)
in your car just drive wherever you want (30:04 - 30:08)
and we'll follow you and they legit did (30:05 - 30:11)
and we we like drove around and looked (30:08 - 30:12)
for some raids and then we couldn't find (30:11 - 30:14)
any so I pulled over into a grocery (30:12 - 30:16)
store parking lot and they pulled up (30:14 - 30:17)
next to me and they were like hey we got (30:16 - 30:19)
this app that helps us do some more (30:17 - 30:21)
raids there's like a raid 10 minutes (30:19 - 30:23)
away if you wanted to do that and I was (30:21 - 30:24)
like yeah sure I'll follow you so we (30:23 - 30:27)
drive over to that and that's when we (30:24 - 30:31)
there was magic our break into an alley (30:27 - 30:37)
and they stole they took our avocado (30:31 - 30:41)
toast they took all my points so we did (30:37 - 30:42)
like a magic art braid and a Vaporeon (30:41 - 30:46)
raid and another non muck another muck (30:42 - 30:47)
because we were waiting for this level (30:46 - 30:49)
for when we got there it was 30 minutes (30:47 - 30:51)
to the level 4 raid so we didn't know (30:49 - 30:53)
what it was going to be so alone for (30:51 - 30:56)
could be a Charizard a Blastoise Venus (30:53 - 31:00)
or a Tran ATAR and I think a Dragon (30:56 - 31:03)
Knight anyway it's just like stage 3 (31:00 - 31:06)
Pokemon so we're like giving each other (31:03 - 31:08)
thumbs up because like we're parked (31:06 - 31:09)
either in front of each other behind (31:08 - 31:11)
each other and so we're driving it to (31:09 - 31:13)
all these raids and then finally the (31:11 - 31:16)
Tyranitar raid pops and it's it's like (31:13 - 31:19)
34,000 CP so it's one of the top tier (31:16 - 31:21)
terrain Attar's and at that point (31:19 - 31:23)
there's only five of us and the guys in (31:21 - 31:25)
the car they were like I don't know if (31:23 - 31:27)
we can do this we did a trance heart (31:25 - 31:29)
earlier and there was 11 people and we (31:27 - 31:31)
got through it ok but I don't know if we (31:29 - 31:33)
can do it with 5 and Micah was very (31:31 - 31:35)
adamant in trying I was very adamant and (31:33 - 31:38)
just like if we're gonna fail we're (31:35 - 31:39)
gonna fail I don't care (31:38 - 31:41)
yeah and I'm I'm to the point where like (31:39 - 31:43)
I don't want to fail because that's a (31:41 - 31:45)
dollar because you can only do one rate (31:43 - 31:48)
for free and if you if you planned out (31:45 - 31:49)
you can technically do two rates for (31:48 - 31:50)
free in a day but that's only if you (31:49 - 31:52)
didn't do your raid before the day (31:50 - 31:54)
before so I've already I'm already like (31:52 - 31:57)
five dollars in for the day for raids so (31:54 - 31:58)
I was like ok well let's just do the (31:57 - 31:59)
Tranter I've never done well (31:58 - 32:01)
for I don't know how hard it is the (31:59 - 32:04)
weirdest part is all these raids were in (32:01 - 32:07)
like a Veterans Park (32:04 - 32:09)
so not only are there and it's a (32:07 - 32:12)
Veterans Park that is under construction (32:09 - 32:15)
so there are all these historical (32:12 - 32:18)
buildings everywhere that are surrounded (32:15 - 32:21)
by 10-foot high fences with barbed wire (32:18 - 32:22)
above it that says no trespassing (32:21 - 32:25)
because everything there is being (32:22 - 32:28)
remodeled and there's a bunch of (32:25 - 32:30)
memorial tombstones everywhere so it's (32:28 - 32:34)
like ah it's yeah when you say Park it's (32:30 - 32:36)
not like it's not like a park that (32:34 - 32:38)
families go to like this is definitely (32:36 - 32:43)
like a memorial park right and to be (32:38 - 32:45)
clear we weren't trespassing where we (32:43 - 32:47)
were we you could be yes yeah (32:45 - 32:49)
totally it's it was almost like though (32:47 - 32:53)
it to me it felt like we were in where (32:49 - 32:55)
they would film ghost hunting stories (32:53 - 32:57)
just because of all the fences and (32:55 - 32:59)
barbed wire and these buildings that and (32:57 - 33:01)
there was no one there we were the only (32:59 - 33:02)
people there these buildings are just (33:01 - 33:06)
ancient buildings and they're they're (33:02 - 33:08)
under a remodel like they're fixing them (33:06 - 33:09)
up but that's why the fences are there (33:08 - 33:11)
so when the terrain ATAR raid was about (33:09 - 33:14)
to pop we had to drive down this really (33:11 - 33:18)
like narrow road to get to it and it was (33:14 - 33:20)
at one of the historical buildings and (33:18 - 33:22)
so when we got to the end of the road it (33:20 - 33:25)
was just a huge fence blocking the (33:22 - 33:27)
building with like no way to turn around (33:25 - 33:29)
without backing straight up I like a (33:27 - 33:33)
half-mile so we're like awkwardly parked (33:29 - 33:35)
at the end of this dead-end street in (33:33 - 33:38)
front of this what seems to be a haunted (33:35 - 33:40)
house waiting for Tyranitar to pop and (33:38 - 33:42)
it popped so five of us joined and then (33:40 - 33:45)
all of a sudden a six person joined so (33:42 - 33:47)
we're like talking between cars and (33:45 - 33:49)
looking around and I'm like guys you got (33:47 - 33:50)
a third person in the back of your car (33:49 - 33:53)
cuz I'm not seeing a sixth person here (33:50 - 33:57)
and they were like no no no so I'm (33:53 - 33:58)
assuming the person was on the other (33:57 - 34:01)
side of the building but anyways we're (33:58 - 34:04)
the most reasonable story is that it was (34:01 - 34:06)
a ghost train er yeah yeah or they were (34:04 - 34:09)
in the building yes a ghost trainer on a (34:06 - 34:12)
ghost train yes okay well let's just do (34:09 - 34:13)
the raid this (34:12 - 34:15)
the six guys willing to commit we can't (34:13 - 34:17)
see where he is but the countdown timer (34:15 - 34:20)
started so we start the raid we go (34:17 - 34:23)
through Tyranitar has like maybe 10% (34:20 - 34:27)
health left but we have about 15 seconds (34:23 - 34:29)
on the clock so we're all like screaming (34:27 - 34:32)
and excitement really happy and then (34:29 - 34:34)
with five seconds left it goes you have (34:32 - 34:37)
failed the raid and we're all like what (34:34 - 34:39)
we have yet just booted everybody we (34:37 - 34:42)
have five seconds range so I was like we (34:39 - 34:44)
we we were going to we were going to do (34:42 - 34:47)
this this is possible a fun fact for (34:44 - 34:50)
people who haven't done harder raids (34:47 - 34:53)
when you use a raid pass you're good for (34:50 - 34:56)
the entire duration of the raid so you (34:53 - 34:58)
can actually do the raid as many times (34:56 - 35:02)
as you want until the rate is over um as (34:58 - 35:05)
many times as you want how do I say this (35:02 - 35:07)
if you succeed you're good but if you (35:05 - 35:10)
keep failing you can still do it if that (35:07 - 35:12)
makes an hour you can yeah you can go (35:10 - 35:15)
back in you can even leave and then come (35:12 - 35:17)
back yeah you just you'll if you leave (35:15 - 35:20)
you lose the party that you're with when (35:17 - 35:22)
when we failed we were like we don't (35:20 - 35:24)
understand why it ended five seconds (35:22 - 35:25)
early but we can definitely do this so I (35:24 - 35:28)
I switched one or two Pokemon around and (35:25 - 35:30)
they started they got back into the red (35:28 - 35:32)
because it's it's free for the hour once (35:30 - 35:34)
you initiate the right pass and we saw (35:32 - 35:36)
that's the sixth invisible guy the ghost (35:34 - 35:38)
we saw that the ghost joined back up (35:36 - 35:40)
against we're like okay good there's (35:38 - 35:44)
still six of us ghost guy is in two guys (35:40 - 35:46)
in the car in all that my car is in so (35:44 - 35:48)
we I think we can do it this time and we (35:46 - 35:50)
did it we finished probably with two (35:48 - 35:53)
seconds left I want to say Micah it was (35:50 - 35:56)
very very close it was very close and so (35:53 - 35:59)
I think I only got five pokeballs or (35:56 - 36:00)
five premier balls I think (35:59 - 36:03)
Eirene Micah did you also get five it (36:00 - 36:05)
was a Valor Jim so I know valor people (36:03 - 36:08)
got more they get like a three if if a (36:05 - 36:11)
raid is on a gym that you own you get a (36:08 - 36:14)
bonus three balls so I think the lowest (36:11 - 36:17)
count of balls you can get is five and (36:14 - 36:18)
the highest count of balls you can get (36:17 - 36:21)
is 13 so I was able to catch the Tranter (36:18 - 36:26)
I have never felt so stressed (36:21 - 36:31)
- so excited in a matter of like two (36:26 - 36:34)
minutes of being like I have only five (36:31 - 36:36)
balls to catch this trance heart I want (36:34 - 36:38)
to train her so bad and being able to (36:36 - 36:39)
catch it (36:38 - 36:41)
Irene caught it Micah you didn't have I (36:39 - 36:44)
alternate of Li went from being the most (36:41 - 36:46)
stressed to the most disappointed in the (36:44 - 36:49)
shortest amount of time I did not catch (36:46 - 36:52)
Terry outs are as vit I was very (36:49 - 36:54)
disappointed I mean I was disappointed (36:52 - 36:57)
in that like I was disappointed that I (36:54 - 36:58)
didn't catch it but I still had a really (36:57 - 37:00)
good time doing it and that seems to be (36:58 - 37:04)
like generally how raids are for me cuz (37:00 - 37:06)
I think the first one I would like I was (37:04 - 37:09)
salty the first time we did a raid and (37:06 - 37:11)
it was I don't remember what it was bay (37:09 - 37:14)
leaf or something and I did I didn't (37:11 - 37:16)
catch it and that was more of (37:14 - 37:18)
frustration in the moment that I didn't (37:16 - 37:20)
understand like I don't understand how (37:18 - 37:22)
the rules work so I was like I just used (37:20 - 37:24)
my rate pass and I'm leaving with (37:22 - 37:27)
nothing and that's really dumb but once (37:24 - 37:30)
you explain like oh you get XP you get (37:27 - 37:33)
items which I skipped past all of that (37:30 - 37:34)
because I was more excited about (37:33 - 37:35)
catching the Pokemon than anything else (37:34 - 37:37)
then it made more sense and now it's (37:35 - 37:39)
more like it's cool to get the (37:37 - 37:41)
experience whatever and it's even better (37:39 - 37:43)
when you catch the Pokemon but just (37:41 - 37:45)
doing the raid in general especially (37:43 - 37:46)
when it's something really challenging (37:45 - 37:49)
like that which is why I like doing even (37:46 - 37:51)
if there's like potential for failure I (37:49 - 37:54)
that's why I like doing the raids like (37:51 - 37:56)
that because the challenge and the (37:54 - 37:59)
excitement of doing it is I feel still (37:56 - 38:01)
rewarding even if you don't catch the (37:59 - 38:05)
Pokemon all I said is and and done I (38:01 - 38:08)
exchanged numbers with the with the two (38:05 - 38:10)
guys in the car and we went on our way (38:08 - 38:12)
but yeah it was it was a really cool (38:10 - 38:15)
experience raid huntin got to Martin (38:12 - 38:16)
news articles here and then we'll take a (38:15 - 38:20)
break first bit is off Kotaku titled (38:16 - 38:22)
nobody thought a competitive pokemon (38:20 - 38:25)
player would win a four verse one but he (38:22 - 38:28)
did this is what happened this happened (38:25 - 38:30)
yesterday here competitive pokemon (38:28 - 38:32)
players usually forfeit a match with (38:30 - 38:34)
seemingly unbeatable odds but the first (38:32 - 38:35)
day of the North American Pokemon (38:34 - 38:37)
international championship is a perfect (38:35 - 38:40)
lesson in why never giving (38:37 - 38:44)
I can pay off must be a John Cena fan (38:40 - 38:46)
giovanni casa (38:44 - 38:49)
this season's quote-unquote evey player (38:46 - 38:52)
found himself facing down one of the (38:49 - 38:54)
most talented players from germany (38:52 - 38:58)
tobias kisaki in the third round of the (38:54 - 39:00)
tournament kosowski (38:58 - 39:04)
was using a team of smeargle porygon z (39:00 - 39:07)
Arcanine tapu bulu hari Mara and nollie (39:04 - 39:10)
go which recently finished Hariyama and (39:07 - 39:14)
he'll ago yeah whatever the the squid (39:10 - 39:18)
thing yeah he'll ago or nil he go I (39:14 - 39:20)
don't the splatoon Pope I heard him (39:18 - 39:22)
yesterday calling it nightly go which I (39:20 - 39:24)
feel like is just a really literal like (39:22 - 39:27)
yeah I mean that was he recently (39:24 - 39:29)
finished in the top four of the Japan (39:27 - 39:31)
national championships Kosta made some (39:29 - 39:33)
major updates to his previous evie team (39:31 - 39:36)
within sinner or taboo Coco whimsicott (39:33 - 39:39)
taboo fini Dragonite and accompanying (39:36 - 39:42)
evolution Pokemon and accompanying the (39:39 - 39:44)
evolution Pokemon they have helped him (39:42 - 39:47)
throughout the secured set to win so is (39:44 - 39:48)
this guy just using a pure Eevee (39:47 - 39:52)
probably extreme Evo boost or whatever (39:48 - 39:56)
the Eevee's yes so Evie has a very good (39:52 - 39:59)
z move where all of its stats are (39:56 - 40:02)
boosted by two stages when you use it (39:59 - 40:04)
however things start looking grim for (40:02 - 40:06)
the Eevee player he eventually lost Game (40:04 - 40:08)
two and was forced into a final match to (40:06 - 40:10)
determine the rounds overall winner (40:08 - 40:12)
Kosta went for his typical Eevee (40:10 - 40:14)
strategy trying to boost its stats (40:12 - 40:16)
before giving them to another Pokemon (40:14 - 40:19)
with baton pass but on the second turn (40:16 - 40:22)
Nellie go and Hariyama made it (40:19 - 40:24)
impossible for that plan to work costa's (40:22 - 40:26)
entirely strat entire strategy was (40:24 - 40:30)
shaken despite costa's effort Kizashi (40:26 - 40:32)
dismantled the rest of the team except (40:30 - 40:34)
for one Dragon Knight at the time dragon (40:32 - 40:36)
dragon Knights demise seemed like a done (40:34 - 40:39)
deal after all it was four against one (40:36 - 40:41)
even the commentators who generally try (40:39 - 40:43)
to never give up on a player's chance of (40:41 - 40:46)
winnings seem to call it you can hear (40:43 - 40:47)
around the twenty five minute mark in (40:46 - 40:50)
the video above I was right the first (40:47 - 40:52)
place at extremely low boost increases (40:50 - 40:54)
your all of you (40:52 - 40:56)
user stats which is gonna be Eevee cuz (40:54 - 41:00)
an Eevee exclusive Ziva move increases (40:56 - 41:03)
all of the stats by two stages so that's (41:00 - 41:05)
a lot and then you use baton pass (41:03 - 41:07)
theoretically to pass it to something (41:05 - 41:08)
that has higher base stats than Eevee (41:07 - 41:09)
got it (41:08 - 41:11)
huzzah she made a mistake after putting (41:09 - 41:14)
Dragonite to sleep the turn before he (41:11 - 41:15)
switched out to his smeargle for a hit (41:14 - 41:18)
for a heavily damaged Hariyama and (41:15 - 41:20)
instead of going for the safe protect to (41:18 - 41:22)
ensure the win he went for hidden power (41:20 - 41:25)
ice with his Niall ego the move was four (41:22 - 41:26)
times super effective and left Dragonite (41:25 - 41:30)
with only 13 HP then despite it being a (41:26 - 41:34)
33% chance Dragonite woke up what's more (41:30 - 41:36)
his kostas Dragonite was packed with (41:34 - 41:38)
earthquake which could finish off both (41:36 - 41:42)
Hariyama and nile ego the crowd exploded (41:38 - 41:44)
with excitement which is even audible on (41:42 - 41:46)
stream when you can see first hand at (41:44 - 41:48)
the 27 minute mark in the video Kosta (41:46 - 41:50)
was still in it after that the whole the (41:48 - 41:52)
whole game came down to whether smeargle (41:50 - 41:55)
could deal 13 damage with a single with (41:52 - 41:57)
its single only attack fake out which (41:55 - 42:00)
works only on the first turn the users (41:57 - 42:02)
on the field it was either that or stall (42:00 - 42:04)
out the rest of the team by putting (42:02 - 42:06)
Dragonite back to sleep with Spore (42:04 - 42:08)
because the timer had run out and the (42:06 - 42:09)
players only had three turns left to (42:08 - 42:13)
decide their to decide a victor Koski (42:09 - 42:15)
could have went for a tiebreaker if it's (42:13 - 42:19)
smeargle kept its own HP above 13 hit (42:15 - 42:21)
points Koshka went for the first option (42:19 - 42:24)
and did only nine points of damage (42:21 - 42:26)
surviving with for surviving with only (42:24 - 42:29)
four HP Dragonite finished the game off (42:26 - 42:31)
and granted Kosta a win that seemed (42:29 - 42:33)
almost impossible (42:31 - 42:35)
it was a match that proved preserving (42:33 - 42:37)
its Pokemon is possible even when all (42:35 - 42:42)
seems lost incredible but there is a (42:37 - 42:44)
video on Kotaku that highlights the (42:42 - 42:47)
entire match I have never heard of this (42:44 - 42:48)
Eevee strategy until now sounds very (42:47 - 42:52)
cool yeah it's not like top tier or (42:48 - 42:56)
anything because it's as if we've (42:52 - 42:57)
mentioned before on the show it's always (42:56 - 43:01)
risky to run a strat that's very much (42:57 - 43:05)
based on pulling off a a setup early on (43:01 - 43:06)
in the match the (43:05 - 43:09)
because as is the case here there are (43:06 - 43:11)
times when your setup gets interrupted (43:09 - 43:14)
and then you end up in really bad (43:11 - 43:17)
circumstances fortunately in this case (43:14 - 43:21)
for the evie player sounds like he was (43:17 - 43:23)
able to end up in that terrible (43:21 - 43:26)
circumstance but still claw a victory (43:23 - 43:28)
which but I mean just by the very nature (43:26 - 43:30)
of the fact that that's newsworthy shows (43:28 - 43:33)
that like it is a very hard circumstance (43:30 - 43:35)
to call yourself out of when you fail to (43:33 - 43:39)
set up the sweep so they can be a fun (43:35 - 43:40)
strat and it's it can be really (43:39 - 43:43)
punishing when it when you aren't able (43:40 - 43:46)
to prevent your opponent from setting it (43:43 - 43:48)
up it can feel like incredibly one-sided (43:46 - 43:51)
but right now I just wanted to highlight (43:48 - 43:53)
some of the Pokemon being used here (43:51 - 43:55)
before we take a break in the north (43:53 - 43:57)
american international championships I'm (43:55 - 43:59)
just gonna run through some Pokemon let (43:57 - 44:01)

got it we have pelipper gold duck cart (44:29 - 44:35)
Anna tapu Layla Metagross and tapu cocoa (44:32 - 44:39)
the so far a lowland Persian I think is (44:35 - 44:41)
probably the one with the lowest with (44:39 - 44:44)
the least usage generally like that one (44:41 - 44:46)
is the one that surprises me so far okay (44:44 - 44:50)
net the pelipper no because pelipper has (44:46 - 44:55)
drizzle okay we have muds dale muck a (44:50 - 44:57)
lowland muck top of cocoa porygon to our (44:55 - 45:00)
canine nine eleven nine tails (44:57 - 45:03)
porygon a twofer that's a strange team (45:00 - 45:06)
there but yeah porygon to formosa nile (45:03 - 45:11)
ego sally ste leah our canine gastro don (45:06 - 45:14)
is a running theme here our canine (45:11 - 45:18)
Garchomp Sela Stila tapu cocoa Snorlax (45:14 - 45:20)
mimic you (45:18 - 45:23)
this is the team where well this is one (45:20 - 45:23)
of the pokemon on the team we're (45:23 - 45:25)
highlighting for Pokemon of the week but (45:23 - 45:28)
we have our k9 buzz wall Chauncey (45:25 - 45:33)
Gyarados Metagross and tapu Coco and I (45:28 - 45:35)
think we're getting into repeat repeats (45:33 - 45:38)
now yeah we have a top abbulu (45:35 - 45:40)
bulu smeargle mimic you another lowland (45:38 - 45:43)
persian for the first a little in (45:40 - 45:45)
persian travis since you said that stood (45:43 - 45:47)
out to you it's moves were parting shot (45:45 - 45:51)
foul play feint and fake out holding a (45:47 - 45:55)
leper pas berry ability fur coat nature (45:51 - 45:58)
Jolly oh yeah I don't know what yeah (45:55 - 46:01)
Papa berry does mmm not sure what that (45:58 - 46:03)
item does but parting shot is a cool (46:01 - 46:07)
move it's like it's a move sort of like (46:03 - 46:10)
volt switch or u-turn in that it has its (46:07 - 46:12)
effect and then the Pokemon switches out (46:10 - 46:17)
but instead of dealing damage lowers the (46:12 - 46:19)
attack and special effect special attack (46:17 - 46:25)
of the target so iqu you can lower their (46:19 - 46:28)
the opponent's offenses and then swap (46:25 - 46:30)
your Pokemon out so it's a cool move not (46:28 - 46:32)
a lot of Pokemon have it it used to be (46:30 - 46:35)
exclusive to Pancham and pangoro that (46:32 - 46:39)
line but in the in Sun and Moon SIL (46:35 - 46:43)
Valley has access to it and then you can (46:39 - 46:45)
breed it into a lowland meows okay so (46:43 - 46:48)
it's breathable mm-hmm gotta work for it (46:45 - 46:50)
you're saying that's correct (46:48 - 46:53)
let me look up what yeah Papa berry does (46:50 - 46:57)
okay oh yeah no wonder I didn't I didn't (46:53 - 46:59)
know exactly what berry this was it's (46:57 - 47:02)
one of the many where pokémon's health (46:59 - 47:06)
is restored by half when its HP drops to (47:02 - 47:09)
1/4 or below there's a whole bunch of (47:06 - 47:12)
them because like depending on the (47:09 - 47:15)
nature of the Pokemon it might have the (47:12 - 47:18)
effect of confusing them so for instance (47:15 - 47:20)
with yup a blueberry you don't want to (47:18 - 47:22)
put it on a Pokemon with a lonely mild (47:20 - 47:25)
gentle or hasty nature because it will (47:22 - 47:27)
confuse them and there's just a whole (47:25 - 47:29)
bunch of berries that have the same (47:27 - 47:32)
effect but confuse different natures and (47:29 - 47:33)
I I don't have all of them memorized (47:32 - 47:36)
got it interesting they're interesting (47:33 - 47:38)
traces of Wendy's and one not to use it (47:36 - 47:41)
because like citrus Barry restores less (47:38 - 47:45)
HP but it does trigger at a higher HP (47:41 - 47:47)
threshold just real quick we'll run on (47:45 - 47:50)
the what TCG decks are made made it into (47:47 - 47:54)
masters we have a Zoroark break as one (47:50 - 47:57)
deck next deck is volcanion tirta Nader (47:54 - 48:00)
following deck is allall the ninetails (47:57 - 48:03)
then we have a deck consisting of DRAM (48:00 - 48:06)
Pagar border we have a greninja break (48:03 - 48:10)
deck we also have a decidua ll the (48:06 - 48:12)
ninetails deck and ade this is you i (48:10 - 48:15)
vileplume deck and then finally sensing (48:12 - 48:20)
a theme fine finally another trampa (48:15 - 48:24)
garbodor deck so TCG focused seems like (48:20 - 48:26)
we have a little bit of a variety at cdc (48:24 - 48:28)
gy being used in two different decks (48:26 - 48:30)
trampa garbodor e being used in two (48:28 - 48:32)
different decks but some different decks (48:30 - 48:34)
being used if we get some results here (48:32 - 48:36)
we'll probably report on this a little (48:34 - 48:38)
more in depth next week Mike and I (48:36 - 48:40)
watched about two hours but I mean (48:38 - 48:41)
besides watching people battle and some (48:40 - 48:44)
commentators I don't think anything to (48:41 - 48:46)
notable to report so that's sweet chancy (48:44 - 48:48)
though but we'll get to that after our (48:46 - 48:52)
break chancy yeah the time we saw the (48:48 - 48:54)
back side of buzz wall which I don't (48:52 - 48:56)
think either of us have ever seen before (48:54 - 48:59)
she's really terrifying yeah normally (48:56 - 49:01)
when I catch pokemon I box them right (48:59 - 49:04)
away I don't actually use yeah we'll (49:01 - 49:06)
take a break here we'll be back with our (49:04 - 49:08)
emails and our Pokemon of the week so (49:06 - 49:11)
sit tight we will be right back (49:08 - 49:13)
you're gonna think outside of the box (49:11 - 49:18)
yeah and outside of the bun (49:13 - 49:18)
I mean that's a pretty good saying and (49:20 - 49:46)
we are back from our break and we are (49:42 - 49:49)
gonna do some emails so if you have any (49:46 - 49:51)

think there was there are Yakima last (50:26 - 50:30)
week too yummy what this person is (50:27 - 50:32)
responding to yeah connecting yeah (50:30 - 50:36)
commence all over actually just in (50:32 - 50:38)
Yakima (50:36 - 50:38)
I wanted to know with pokemon ultra Sun (50:39 - 50:45)
and ultra moon coming out which pokemon (50:43 - 50:47)
do you want to get a lowland form and (50:45 - 50:50)
why design ideals for said pokemon uh (50:47 - 50:53)
Sophia I don't think we have any aloe (50:50 - 50:55)
and Pokemon that were originally (50:53 - 50:57)
ghost-type so that would be interesting (50:55 - 50:59)
to see like in a lowland gastly that's (50:57 - 51:01)
what I was gonna say hello and ghastly (50:59 - 51:03)
but only because I want to see if a (51:01 - 51:06)
lowland Gengar cuz it's you know there's (51:03 - 51:08)
like no practicalities and other than I (51:06 - 51:10)
just want that it is possible though to (51:08 - 51:12)
just have a lowland Gengar because we (51:10 - 51:15)
don't have a low and execute that's not (51:12 - 51:17)
a thing that's true right (51:15 - 51:21)
I just want moral olan Pokemon that just (51:17 - 51:23)
are the same Pokemon but with cool hair (51:21 - 51:27)
like piglet and Doug Dan actually do you (51:23 - 51:29)
have an example yes you do there's that (51:27 - 51:30)
yeah that is that is a thing that (51:29 - 51:33)
happened to you it does (51:30 - 51:35)
I just want that do you guys think that (51:33 - 51:39)
will get generation 200 and Pokemon or (51:35 - 51:43)
are they really going to again tackle (51:39 - 51:45)
well they could do no a lowland Pokemon (51:43 - 51:47)
that's that's the thing but I don't know (51:45 - 51:50)
if I would want them to touch more (51:47 - 51:52)
generation 1 Pokemon and I feel like (51:50 - 51:53)
what's theirs (51:52 - 51:56)
great yeah I had kind of assumed that (51:53 - 51:59)
they weren't I don't know why I just (51:56 - 52:01)
assumed that the new stuff that we would (51:59 - 52:03)
see it would be like like there wasn't (52:01 - 52:05)
anything really new aside from like the (52:03 - 52:08)
kyurem forms in black 2 and white 2 (52:05 - 52:10)
right they didn't introduce anything (52:08 - 52:13)
essentially yeah like no new Pokemon (52:10 - 52:15)
except maybe some of the event (52:13 - 52:17)
Legendary's were released after the (52:15 - 52:19)
release of that I can't quite remember (52:17 - 52:21)
and the same thing with like omega ruby (52:19 - 52:23)
and alpha sapphire i don't know i just (52:21 - 52:24)
assumed that there they weren't going to (52:23 - 52:26)
introduce anything new aside from like (52:24 - 52:29)
all 4 new mega is in alpha and omega (52:26 - 52:31)
ruby alpha oh yeah that's true that's (52:29 - 52:33)
true was I was thinking of like was (52:31 - 52:35)
there a legendary Pokemon that got (52:33 - 52:37)
released during black and white and (52:35 - 52:38)
black and white - that was only (52:37 - 52:41)
obtainable in black and white - I think (52:38 - 52:43)
it was just curious (52:41 - 52:47)
karyam forms yeah like you couldn't get (52:43 - 52:51)
black curium or white curium in black (52:47 - 52:54)
and white one that was specific her (52:51 - 52:56)
black and white - you needed DNA (52:54 - 52:59)
splicers but you could get cure cure him (52:56 - 53:02)
yeah yeah yeah I mean if they do that's (52:59 - 53:05)
cool I'm I'm really into the lowland (53:02 - 53:07)
forms I think they're cool and unique (53:05 - 53:09)
and everything and it would be cool to (53:07 - 53:12)
see more of it both of you give me one a (53:09 - 53:13)
lowland form you'd want to see from (53:12 - 53:17)
generation to mmm (53:13 - 53:22)
Dunsparce alright I don't know how (53:17 - 53:22)
that's worse this like so particularly (53:23 - 53:28)
what it is I don't even know how you I (53:25 - 53:32)
think I think Anna loli loli and I think (53:28 - 53:35)
in a low and mareep laughs II and (53:32 - 53:38)
Ampharos very interesting and they (53:35 - 53:40)
already got Megas that's true that like (53:38 - 53:42)
a thing though the kid don't there's (53:40 - 53:44)
there's no there's no a lowland form (53:42 - 53:46)
that also has a mega form right (53:44 - 53:53)
until now oh maybe maybe I'd really like (53:46 - 53:55)
to see in a low and politoed actually I (53:53 - 53:58)
feel like Polly toads already alone no (53:55 - 54:01)
I'd like to see a polytope that's an (53:58 - 54:03)
alone and politoed that looks more like (54:01 - 54:08)
Poliwhirl I feel like Slowking blossom (54:03 - 54:11)
and politoed all already fit like some (54:08 - 54:13)
aloe in tropical theme (54:11 - 54:16)
I may be mellow I'm this is going back a (54:13 - 54:18)
little bit but maybe meloetta wasn't (54:16 - 54:20)
released until after the release of (54:18 - 54:24)
black 2 and white 2 oh yeah oh I think (54:20 - 54:26)
you could get it on any of the games but (54:24 - 54:28)
steering logic here we go the case a (54:26 - 54:32)
lowland [ __ ] wrath what Oh under a (54:28 - 54:39)
furry yeah would it just be like a (54:32 - 54:41)
long-drawn the only thing they should do (54:39 - 54:45)
to it is just reverse its colors there's (54:41 - 54:47)
like instead of the front being yellow (54:45 - 54:49)
the front is brown and instead of its (54:47 - 54:51)
butt being brown its butt is yellow (54:49 - 54:52)
perfect (54:51 - 54:55)
what a cool poke when I heard what when (54:52 - 54:57)
I know you didn't I know well it's (54:55 - 55:01)
obviously it's obvious already that the (54:57 - 55:02)
pronunciation was off but I thought you (55:01 - 55:06)
said hello and jyggalag which is the (55:02 - 55:10)
main villain from the Elder Scrolls for (55:06 - 55:12)
oblivion Shivering Isles expansion and (55:10 - 55:17)
the idea of a beach vibes version of the (55:12 - 55:20)
terrifying giant suit of armor that's (55:17 - 55:22)
the Daedric prince of order is something (55:20 - 55:24)
I am very interested to him I've never (55:22 - 55:27)
been so happy to hear anybody talk about (55:24 - 55:33)
elder scrolls for oblivion before all (55:27 - 55:37)
right what if we have a lowland dawn fan (55:33 - 55:41)
and instead of being what is donphan (55:37 - 55:44)
just ground yep oh it should be ground (55:41 - 55:48)
electric and when it rolls it builds up (55:44 - 55:52)
electricity I'm sold (55:48 - 55:53)
and that's that's farther than anything (55:52 - 55:58)
I've been able to come up with I was (55:53 - 56:00)
thinking like ground fire but I think we (55:58 - 56:03)
already had like Mara cargo and slugma (56:00 - 56:06)
that generation which i think is ground (56:03 - 56:08)
fire yeah rock fight rock phone plug (56:06 - 56:12)
Mysterio and magcargo is rock sapphire (56:08 - 56:13)
rock (56:12 - 56:15)
I'm just pandering at this point but (56:13 - 56:18)
what about on a lowland piloswine I mean (56:15 - 56:20)
I wasn't gonna say it because that would (56:18 - 56:21)
just be a little too obvious (56:20 - 56:23)
coming from you cliche but I mean like (56:21 - 56:28)
I'm not gonna say no let me ask you if (56:23 - 56:31)
you could if you could have an aloe and (56:28 - 56:32)
pilot pilot wine what would be the (56:31 - 56:35)
difference from original piloswine so (56:32 - 56:37)
that's ice ice ground right yeah it is (56:35 - 56:39)
originally ice cream I mean give me the (56:37 - 56:41)
type you me the type change (56:39 - 56:46)
let's do ground flying it just gets so (56:41 - 56:49)
it just puffs up so much and get so (56:46 - 56:53)
fluffy that it just like is so not dense (56:49 - 56:56)
that it is less dense than the air and (56:53 - 56:58)
just floats up to the sky into the (56:56 - 57:00)
heavens where it belongs (56:58 - 57:05)
from what the humidity it's like you (57:00 - 57:08)
know yeah all right no actually even (57:05 - 57:13)
better it it it's a little I flap suffer (57:08 - 57:16)
they form giant like hot-air balloons (57:13 - 57:20)
but make it like a lighter than air (57:16 - 57:23)
durable and it just carries it so (57:20 - 57:26)
drifter if flume has some competition (57:23 - 57:30)
yep what would it ruin piloswine for you (57:26 - 57:33)
if a lowland pile of swamp because the (57:30 - 57:35)
red head is still there if a lowland (57:33 - 57:40)
piloswine had visible eyes we've seen (57:35 - 57:42)
pylos wines eyes in the on ma are they (57:40 - 57:44)
terrifying and they're great I've never (57:42 - 57:47)
seen this yeah I think so I can't quite (57:44 - 57:49)
remember I think they're just eyes The (57:47 - 57:53)
Fixer just I yeah I mean just like (57:49 - 57:55)
you're normal you're like average (57:53 - 57:58)
ordinary oh yeah oh yeah there's just a (57:55 - 58:00)
little little button eyes they're pretty (57:58 - 58:03)
cute yeah yeah Jonathan (58:00 - 58:06)
Wrightson says I need to know if anyone (58:03 - 58:08)
else thinks this is insane see attached (58:06 - 58:11)
image I'm a huge Gen 2 fan I'll get to (58:08 - 58:12)
the image I am a huge dent to fan (58:11 - 58:14)
probably my favorite generation that (58:12 - 58:15)
being said I would have a hard time (58:14 - 58:19)
paying more than $100 for this nice (58:15 - 58:22)
looking set of badges attached is an (58:19 - 58:25)
image of the framed gym badges of Johto (58:22 - 58:29)
on Pokemon Center calm but for a hundred (58:25 - 58:30)
and eighty dollars for eight badges that (58:29 - 58:32)
aren't even made with silver or any type (58:30 - 58:36)
of interesting stone that's absurd is it (58:32 - 58:36)
not (58:36 - 58:39)
they look nice but I'm fairly certain I (58:36 - 58:41)
remember TCG events where they gave gym (58:39 - 58:43)
badges away for free I apologized for (58:41 - 58:46)
the Pokemon Center rant but can you (58:43 - 58:48)
reason out the paying for this Steve (58:46 - 58:50)
you're a good dude well as a total (58:48 - 58:52)
sweetheart Travis seems like a pretty (58:50 - 58:56)
good dude that the metal what he's that (58:52 - 58:58)
metal what screams they did in the (58:56 - 59:02)
Burgess song was dope thanks for your (58:58 - 59:06)
time at oh it's just Johnny have you (59:02 - 59:08)

didn't they yeah it was I saw that uh (59:10 - 59:14)
$180 (59:13 - 59:17)
I could probably justify the price here (59:14 - 59:21)
please do cuz I'm I'm in what was their (59:17 - 59:24)
name Johnny I'm in Johnny's court right (59:21 - 59:28)

quality of badges because they're behind (59:28 - 59:37)
glass here and I dunno I I do have some (59:32 - 59:41)
of the original toys-r-us League badges (59:37 - 59:42)

channel youtube.com slash pkmn cast and (60:00 - 60:05)
one of those reviews are I don't know if (60:02 - 60:06)
it'll be this week or next week because (60:05 - 60:10)
I recorded 10 different reviews one of (60:06 - 60:11)
those reviews were the Pokemon Center (60:10 - 60:14)
Hoopa confined in Hoopa unbound Pokemon (60:11 - 60:16)
pins so those pins are $12.99 (60:14 - 60:21)
which comes down to about 650 a pin and (60:16 - 60:23)
I would say the quality of those pins (60:21 - 60:29)
are years better than the toys-r-us (60:23 - 60:31)
Jim League badges that you got back in (60:29 - 60:35)
like 2000 is it possible that's because (60:31 - 60:39)
it's been years since no no just like (60:35 - 60:42)
the the back plunger and the thickness (60:39 - 60:45)
and the enamel they use well on their (60:42 - 60:47)
die cut too like the Pokemon toys-r-us (60:45 - 60:50)
badges were just like rectangles that (60:47 - 60:53)
they had like a I don't know like a (60:50 - 60:57)
print it wasn't like they had any kind (60:53 - 61:00)
of bevel or embossing or like filled (60:57 - 61:02)
enamel or anything like that it was (61:00 - 61:05)
really really basic you do $12.99 which (61:02 - 61:07)
is two pins and you times that by four (61:05 - 61:09)
to equal eight you're looking at about (61:07 - 61:14)
$52 for pins so that leaves a hundred (61:09 - 61:17)
and twenty dollars of what am I paying (61:14 - 61:21)
for there at that point as somebody who (61:17 - 61:23)
has hosted two art shows and have has (61:21 - 61:29)
done framing and cutting and sealing I (61:23 - 61:32)
think a lot of people don't realize how (61:29 - 61:34)
expensive it is to frame something (61:32 - 61:37)
professionally and that's what you're (61:34 - 61:40)
getting with the gym badges of Johto and (61:37 - 61:43)
the gym badges of Kanto not to mention (61:40 - 61:45)
that you get free shipping over fifty (61:43 - 61:47)
dollars so I'm assuming that yeah (61:45 - 61:49)
shipping is probably just built into the (61:47 - 61:49)
cost (61:49 - 61:52)
yeah I'm assuming that twenty to thirty (61:49 - 61:54)
dollars of this one hundred eight eighty (61:52 - 61:58)
dollars is dedicated directly to the (61:54 - 62:01)
shipping and making sure that the glass (61:58 - 62:03)
here doesn't break and the frame here (62:01 - 62:06)
doesn't get dented any other insurance (62:03 - 62:07)
costs because you are gonna get free (62:06 - 62:10)
shipping on this that leaves about $90 (62:07 - 62:13)
for the actual frame itself which is (62:10 - 62:17)
actually it should be more expensive (62:13 - 62:22)
yeah I just framed Irene's diploma and (62:17 - 62:26)
if I didn't with with a coupon it was a (62:22 - 62:28)
hundred dollars to professionally frame (62:26 - 62:30)
that diploma here's the deal though (62:28 - 62:31)
you're going (62:30 - 62:32)
to a place where there they're doing (62:31 - 62:35)
that one time for you this is a this is (62:32 - 62:38)
a difference between like a situational (62:35 - 62:40)
framing like I did a lot of framing to (62:38 - 62:42)
because I went to art school and we had (62:40 - 62:43)
a lot of galleries and we had to frame (62:42 - 62:45)
professionally to make it look nice and (62:43 - 62:47)
it was expensive and it sucked but (62:45 - 62:50)
that's you know student loans we did it (62:47 - 62:55)
uh and a big part of it was always that (62:50 - 62:59)
it was you were doing it it like as a (62:55 - 63:01)
single person in a shop where there's (62:59 - 63:03)
like two or three people working that (63:01 - 63:07)
are doing it for you and this is (63:03 - 63:09)
obviously a product that's like being (63:07 - 63:15)
mass-produced products being (63:09 - 63:18)
mass-produced there are so many 400 to (63:15 - 63:20)
500 items on Pokemon Center comm I don't (63:18 - 63:22)
think this is getting mass-produced they (63:20 - 63:25)
probably made 100 or 200 of these I mean (63:22 - 63:29)
it's not it's hard in its not to say (63:25 - 63:32)
that it's not hard to frame that framing (63:29 - 63:35)
sucks no it does suck it totally sucks (63:32 - 63:38)
but it's not hard to produce a hundred (63:35 - 63:42)
to two hundred of one like like pieces (63:38 - 63:44)
of frames that you're then assembling (63:42 - 63:47)
for way cheaper than what it would cost (63:44 - 63:50)
to do that for one piece like it's a (63:47 - 63:53)
really significant difference I would I (63:50 - 63:56)
would be okay with like maybe it it's (63:53 - 64:02)
like 40 to $50 $100 of the cost no way (63:56 - 64:04)
that product frame itself is probably (64:02 - 64:07)
$30 the actual border canvas and there's (64:04 - 64:11)
probably ten so you're at $50 there and (64:07 - 64:15)
then somebody's work to like cut that (64:11 - 64:17)
frame and they could be buying it but I (64:15 - 64:19)
doubt it because of I have the actual (64:17 - 64:21)
size of the frame here it's it's ten by (64:19 - 64:23)
five not to mention the fact that three (64:21 - 64:26)
that's not this financial breakdown (64:23 - 64:28)
assumes then that they're making zero (64:26 - 64:31)
profit on this which i extremely doubt (64:28 - 64:33)
no they're probably making profit but I (64:31 - 64:36)
I don't think that this is overpriced I (64:33 - 64:38)
don't think a hundred and eighty dollars (64:36 - 64:40)
for this Pokemon Center item is (64:38 - 64:42)
overpriced Pokemon Center comm there are (64:40 - 64:44)
one two three four five six (64:42 - 64:47)
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve (64:44 - 64:50)
different pieces of artwork framed by (64:47 - 64:53)
Ken's Sugimori probably not framed by (64:50 - 64:56)
Ken Sugimori but the artworks by him for (64:53 - 65:00)
$250 each so I am assuming that they are (64:56 - 65:04)
using the same exact frame company that (65:00 - 65:06)
they are using for the kantou premium (65:04 - 65:09)
gym set and a Kanto or that the johto (65:06 - 65:12)
premium gym set I mean it still says (65:09 - 65:14)
it's made in China so I mean we can (65:12 - 65:16)
assume all day that it's like framed (65:14 - 65:20)
here and it's really nice and high (65:16 - 65:21)
quality and everything and it may be (65:20 - 65:22)
nice and high quality and everything but (65:21 - 65:24)
it still could at the end of the day be (65:22 - 65:26)
made in China where it's incredibly (65:24 - 65:28)
cheap to produce and it's true we don't (65:26 - 65:29)
so we don't know the paper quality we (65:28 - 65:32)
don't quality I don't think I'll tell (65:29 - 65:34)
you I'll be the first to tell you as an (65:32 - 65:36)
artist when when you buy something (65:34 - 65:38)
that's framed you're paying for the (65:36 - 65:42)
frame but you're paying way way more for (65:38 - 65:44)
the art if you're paying for the art (65:42 - 65:46)
you're not paying for the printing and (65:44 - 65:49)
the framing and all that like especially (65:46 - 65:51)
in situations like this words it's very (65:49 - 65:53)
likely man what do you even if you're (65:51 - 65:55)
well there's only 50 there all these are (65:53 - 65:58)
limited 50 runs so yeah it's still being (65:55 - 66:00)
mass-produced they made one thing (65:58 - 66:01)
they've made it 50 times and now they're (66:00 - 66:03)
selling it that's fine when no one's (66:01 - 66:06)
questioning that if you're going to (66:03 - 66:08)
let's say they get rid of the frame and (66:06 - 66:10)
you don't want to buy the frame and they (66:08 - 66:13)
sell the piece for a hundred and twenty (66:10 - 66:15)
dollars so you're just getting the print (66:13 - 66:20)
itself mm-hmm I don't know you tasty (66:15 - 66:24)
profit margin yes no it's not I don't (66:20 - 66:26)
know anyone who would buy a hundred and (66:24 - 66:28)
twenty dollar piece of art and then just (66:26 - 66:32)
put it in like a $10 frame you could you (66:28 - 66:35)
absolutely could and it would work and (66:32 - 66:36)
you could hang it on your wall (66:35 - 66:39)
but the whole point of professionally (66:36 - 66:43)
framed art is not only is it sealed so (66:39 - 66:45)
dust and debris doesn't get inside (66:43 - 66:48)
usually the glass is UV protected so (66:45 - 66:49)
then when it's sitting on your wall and (66:48 - 66:52)
the Sun shines on it the actual artwork (66:49 - 66:55)
doesn't fade I think that you are giving (66:52 - 66:58)
I think you are not even enough (66:55 - 67:01)
credit for how oh absolutely I am it is (66:58 - 67:04)
truly a piece of art work but what I'm (67:01 - 67:06)
saying is they don't have like a shop (67:04 - 67:07)
that they're mailing these to in the (67:06 - 67:09)
United States that's framing these and (67:07 - 67:12)
it's it's like what you would pay or I (67:09 - 67:14)
would pay to go and have something (67:12 - 67:16)
framed they're doing this through (67:14 - 67:18)
probably a manufacturer in China I mean (67:16 - 67:21)
it's a description it literally says in (67:18 - 67:23)
the product description country of (67:21 - 67:25)
origin printed in Japan frame made in (67:23 - 67:26)
the USA (67:25 - 67:29)
I don't litter makes it badges which (67:26 - 67:30)
just says country of origin made in (67:29 - 67:32)
China I guarantee I guarantee you those (67:30 - 67:35)
badges are made in China but the frame (67:32 - 67:38)
and the canvas are exactly the same on (67:35 - 67:40)
this and the other one so I'm assuming (67:38 - 67:42)
they're getting framed in the USA near (67:40 - 67:43)
the Amazon ship center that they're (67:42 - 67:45)
shipping to I think the only solution (67:43 - 67:47)
here is that you need to buy these and (67:45 - 67:50)
then get them for YouTube channel one I (67:47 - 67:52)
have a theory (67:50 - 67:56)
what if stay with me here what if the (67:52 - 68:01)
person in charge of curating the Pokemon (67:56 - 68:05)
Center online shop was told that the new (68:01 - 68:09)
games feature a lowland forms and (68:05 - 68:11)
misheard and thought the person said a (68:09 - 68:14)
lowland frames and was like gosh I guess (68:11 - 68:20)
we need a lot of rain a ton of rain now (68:14 - 68:24)
I will gladly admit I'm wrong if if I (68:20 - 68:26)
was to get my hands on one of these and (68:24 - 68:30)
it was like cheap Plexiglas and the the (68:26 - 68:34)
mat was just poorly cut or hand cut (68:30 - 68:38)
badly or just a really thin like those (68:34 - 68:40)
thin mats you get when you buy a frame (68:38 - 68:42)
at michaels that are just like (68:40 - 68:44)
see-through when you hold up the light (68:42 - 68:46)
like what I'm seeing at the pictures is (68:44 - 68:48)
I'm seeing double matted prints which is (68:46 - 68:50)
usually a little bit more expensive than (68:48 - 68:52)
just a single mat and it also looks way (68:50 - 68:54)
better but I will definitely eat my (68:52 - 68:58)
lunch if if there's I guarantee you it's (68:54 - 69:01)
probably glass and it's probably like (68:58 - 69:05)
it's it's probably what's the term (69:01 - 69:08)
compressed wood what's the the the (69:05 - 69:10)
quality of the frame yeah (69:08 - 69:12)
whatever the the material is compressed (69:10 - 69:13)
wood I can't remember them yeah is it (69:12 - 69:15)
doesn't doesn't say in any of the (69:13 - 69:17)
descriptions what I guarantee you it's (69:15 - 69:19)
still gonna be like it's gonna look and (69:17 - 69:20)
feel quality because it's still the (69:19 - 69:22)
Pokemon company like they're not gonna (69:20 - 69:24)
go through a Chinese manufacturer that's (69:22 - 69:25)
gonna make it look and if the frame is (69:24 - 69:27)
made in the US that's fine that's not (69:25 - 69:28)
necessarily saying that it's (69:27 - 69:30)
manufactured in the US or that it's put (69:28 - 69:35)
together in the u.s. I mean frame in the (69:30 - 69:37)
US send it to China and then send it (69:35 - 69:40)
back I feel like maybe but I mean the (69:37 - 69:43)
cost it's significantly different than (69:40 - 69:46)
if you or I were like oh we should sell (69:43 - 69:48)
some Ken Sugimori art and have it framed (69:46 - 69:50)
and then mail it to people like this is (69:48 - 69:52)
a company that knows what they're doing (69:50 - 69:54)
and knows profit margins yeah but that (69:52 - 69:56)
doesn't what I'm saying is that doesn't (69:54 - 69:59)
mean the framing is not like people (69:56 - 70:02)
don't understand how much it is to frame (69:59 - 70:04)
something I agree with you that it's (70:02 - 70:06)
underestimated how much it costs to (70:04 - 70:10)
frame stuff but that's when it's URI and (70:06 - 70:11)
we're going to Michaels or we're going (70:10 - 70:13)
to not Michaels we're going to the Great (70:11 - 70:16)
Frame up or whatever like also by the (70:13 - 70:18)
way framing stores have the worst pawn (70:16 - 70:20)
names of all time but that's beside the (70:18 - 70:23)
point uh but you're right it is it is (70:20 - 70:26)
typically it is taken for granted how (70:23 - 70:27)
much it costs to to print and frame (70:26 - 70:29)
stuff all right (70:27 - 70:31)
this is emails from Gabriel from (70:29 - 70:34)
somewhere in Canada at all Ottawa how do (70:31 - 70:38)
you say it Travis Ottawa ah de Ottawa (70:34 - 70:40)
ash awhat (70:38 - 70:43)
hi my name is Joshua my name is Gabriel (70:40 - 70:44)
I'm a new listener I've been catching up (70:43 - 70:47)
on episodes I just listen to episode 264 (70:44 - 70:48)
where you guys talk about sound tight (70:47 - 70:52)
Pokemon this might be late to the (70:48 - 70:53)
discussion but here are my thoughts (70:52 - 70:55)
flying would definitely be strong (70:53 - 70:58)
against sound as wind can easily drowned (70:55 - 71:01)
out sound also sound types should be (70:58 - 71:03)
strong against psychic as noise can (71:01 - 71:06)
destroy disrupt the concentration of (71:03 - 71:09)
psychic users my love of Skyrim is also (71:06 - 71:11)
inclined me to suggest that sound would (71:09 - 71:15)
be strong against dragon but I don't (71:11 - 71:16)
know how much sense this would make in (71:15 - 71:18)
the Pokemon universe I have a question (71:16 - 71:19)
for everyone if you could be a trial (71:18 - 71:21)
captain or a gym leader what would your (71:19 - 71:24)
type be and or what would your trial / (71:21 - 71:26)
Jim puzzle consist of thank you for all (71:24 - 71:28)
your hard work in making the podcast (71:26 - 71:31)
makes my days go by so much faster I (71:28 - 71:33)
love everyone on the show but will is (71:31 - 71:36)
definitely my favorite Gabriel I feel (71:33 - 71:37)
like we get to ask this gym leader (71:36 - 71:40)
question a lot but but this one is (71:37 - 71:41)
different because it's also asking us to (71:40 - 71:44)
make some sort of trial challenge yeah I (71:41 - 71:47)
just wanna props to Gabriel here for (71:44 - 71:49)
really thinking about sound type I think (71:47 - 71:51)
all the suggestions were really good I (71:49 - 71:54)
disagree philosophically with the second (71:51 - 71:56)
one because all of psychics weaknesses (71:54 - 72:03)
as they stand are common fears so right (71:56 - 72:06)
so the fear of ghosts like the fear of (72:03 - 72:09)
the supernatural the fear of insects (72:06 - 72:11)
that's why it's weak to bug dark is a (72:09 - 72:15)
little different but it's still uh it's (72:11 - 72:19)
still like you know the fear of (72:15 - 72:21)
it's like evil I don't think anybody's (72:19 - 72:23)
really afraid of well I guess you could (72:21 - 72:25)
be afraid of sound but it's not like a (72:23 - 72:30)
typically recognised fear so I I like (72:25 - 72:32)
that psychic has that sort of theme with (72:30 - 72:34)
all of its weaknesses but I like the (72:32 - 72:38)
sound I can one never made that (72:34 - 72:40)
connection before so that's really (72:38 - 72:41)
interesting one school sometimes (72:40 - 72:43)
sometimes that's pretty pretty sweet (72:41 - 72:46)
that's pretty neat but what if there was (72:43 - 72:51)
framed Pokemon artwork what if we got (72:46 - 72:55)
frame types the most expensive pokemon (72:51 - 72:56)
in the universe (72:55 - 72:59)
what if Conkeldurr used the materials (72:56 - 73:03)
that carry to build giant frames I (72:59 - 73:06)
mentioned before oh you're going later (73:03 - 73:12)
and I think if I were a trial captain (73:06 - 73:14)
here's the thing I actually kind of like (73:12 - 73:18)
the ice slide II puzzles (73:14 - 73:20)
sometimes if they're done well not bad (73:18 - 73:23)
um so maybe I would do one of those or (73:20 - 73:25)
maybe it would just be I don't know (73:23 - 73:26)
actually if it were to fit my (73:25 - 73:28)
personality would probably be a sillier (73:26 - 73:31)
one a lava like the fire trial in Sun (73:28 - 73:33)
and Moon where it's like you think it's (73:31 - 73:35)
gonna be like this intense spot the (73:33 - 73:37)
difference game and then it's a like (73:35 - 73:39)
just a nice silly joke mine would (73:37 - 73:43)
probably be a similar thing I'm not that (73:39 - 73:45)
I'm not like a puzzle II person it (73:43 - 73:46)
probably wouldn't fit my personality (73:45 - 73:50)
that well I would be a water gym leader (73:46 - 73:53)
I've said this before but my gym would (73:50 - 73:56)
be exactly like the Cerulean City Gym in (73:53 - 74:00)
the anime whereas except the water is (73:56 - 74:04)
all dr. pepper except like what I guess (74:00 - 74:07)
my my like complaint of the game is if (74:04 - 74:09)
you have an all water gym and just like (74:07 - 74:13)
cerulean city in the anime they really (74:09 - 74:15)
require - to pick Pokemon that could (74:13 - 74:17)
either one stand on a platform and (74:15 - 74:20)
battle up there or to just swim like why (74:17 - 74:24)
isn't that mechanic or rules set up more (74:20 - 74:27)
in in the anime like if I was at the (74:24 - 74:29)
Cerulean City Gym and I was battling a (74:27 - 74:31)
gym leader I couldn't use a Snorlax (74:29 - 74:32)
because Snorlax would make the platform (74:31 - 74:36)
sink and Snorlax would then drowned it (74:32 - 74:39)
would force you to change to use (74:36 - 74:41)
different Pokemon like gyms should have (74:39 - 74:45)
it so you would be forced in a way to (74:41 - 74:47)
change your team up more than just (74:45 - 74:49)
picking six Pokemon or just picking your (74:47 - 74:51)
starter and over leveling it and just (74:49 - 74:54)
burning through the actual game that (74:51 - 74:56)
would be my mechanic of like hey only (74:54 - 74:58)
certain Pokemon can work here all water (74:56 - 75:00)
pokemon could work here but only a (74:58 - 75:01)
certain Pokemon under a certain weight (75:00 - 75:03)
could stand on these platforms and (75:01 - 75:06)
actually battle hmm don'ts in the (75:03 - 75:08)
mechanic can I ask a question real quick (75:06 - 75:10)
this is a question I think about (75:08 - 75:12)
probably every single day (75:10 - 75:15)
in lieutenant surges gym with the (75:12 - 75:18)
garbage cans was there actually (75:15 - 75:20)
instructions and how to properly do that (75:18 - 75:24)
gym or were they solely relying on you (75:20 - 75:26)
to just keep guessing (75:24 - 75:28)
did they any point in the game prior to (75:26 - 75:32)
that like to tell you that you could (75:28 - 75:35)
look in garbage cans because I feel like (75:32 - 75:37)
once I walked in there when I played it (75:35 - 75:41)
the first time I was like oh I can look (75:37 - 75:44)
at the it's it's the garbage cans and I (75:41 - 75:46)
can look at him and I just feel like (75:44 - 75:48)
that was just like (75:46 - 75:51)
known I mean certainly items in garbage (75:48 - 75:53)
cans before that yeah right check but I (75:51 - 75:54)
man like everyday ever (75:53 - 75:56)
inform you in the game prior to that (75:54 - 75:58)
like hey you can look in garbage we some (75:56 - 76:04)
animals like I wouldn't yes yeah I like (75:58 - 76:09)
throwing away full potions it's either (76:04 - 76:12)
in Vilonia in my house is because (76:09 - 76:14)
there's throwing potions in the trash (76:12 - 76:16)
it's either yeah Travis Travis is right (76:14 - 76:18)
it's either in Viridian City or pute (76:16 - 76:21)
City where an npc says they threw away a (76:18 - 76:23)
potion and then you go over to the (76:21 - 76:25)
garbage can and you check and you get (76:23 - 76:27)
the potion that's that's not anything (76:25 - 76:31)
that maybe that like is the is what led (76:27 - 76:33)
to when you walk in there and it's a (76:31 - 76:36)
room full of garbage can so yeah yeah I (76:33 - 76:38)
don't think anyone got stuck on the (76:36 - 76:40)
whole point part of like checking (76:38 - 76:44)
garbage cans I'm asking though is is (76:40 - 76:48)
there a rhyme or like does any it ever (76:44 - 76:51)
state that like you need to find two (76:48 - 76:54)
switches to open the final door and how (76:51 - 76:56)
they would relate to each other or is it (76:54 - 76:58)
really just a guessing game because if (76:56 - 77:01)
you guess the first switch and then you (76:58 - 77:03)
guess another switch it resets and so (77:01 - 77:05)
then you go back to the first switch to (77:03 - 77:08)
find the second switch and usually with (77:05 - 77:10)
any type of puzzle there's like a (77:08 - 77:12)
there's like a reason for the puzzle or (77:10 - 77:16)
like a hint or like some instruction I (77:12 - 77:18)
don't think there was any instruction (77:16 - 77:21)
I'm fairly certain when you get the (77:18 - 77:24)
first switch it says you need to get one (77:21 - 77:27)
more and when you get the when you pick (77:24 - 77:29)
the wrong garbage can after that then it (77:27 - 77:31)
says something like oh no those switches (77:29 - 77:35)
reset I believe it's been a long time (77:31 - 77:37)
but I'm like ninety I don't have certain (77:35 - 77:40)
long it's a collection of the puzzle to (77:37 - 77:43)
like even contribute much hmm maybe a (77:40 - 77:46)
listener will know I'm just I just as a (77:43 - 77:49)
10 year old playing that game I don't (77:46 - 77:51)
know how I got through that gym without (77:49 - 77:53)
just like without just trial and error (77:51 - 77:56)
but I yeah I feel like a Pokemon game is (77:53 - 77:58)
way more than trial and error I feel (77:56 - 78:00)
like there had been some instruction or (77:58 - 78:01)
some hints that I'd (78:00 - 78:04)
wasn't reading as a kid I feel like I (78:01 - 78:08)
mean I think it also may be over (78:04 - 78:11)
counting the ability of children to like (78:08 - 78:14)
just get something pretty quickly there (78:11 - 78:16)
are lots of things that I feel like I as (78:14 - 78:19)
an adult I would be like pretty (78:16 - 78:21)
mystified by but as a kid it was like no (78:19 - 78:21)
big deal (78:21 - 78:23)
I mean I'm not spending I'm not saying I (78:21 - 78:25)
spent hours on it as a kid I probably (78:23 - 78:27)
just activated every single garbage can (78:25 - 78:29)
until it opened and didn't really think (78:27 - 78:32)
anything more of that yeah I don't know (78:29 - 78:34)
as a kid how I got through these but I (78:32 - 78:36)
definitely did let's let's do one more (78:34 - 78:40)
question this is from Nick from Chora (78:36 - 78:43)
Nora can't California I don't know hey (78:40 - 78:48)
what's up Canada cornea Cora nach Corona (78:43 - 78:49)
Corona (78:48 - 78:52)
yeah probably Corona longtime listener (78:49 - 78:54)
current patreon backer SBJ you're the (78:52 - 78:57)
best Myka you're just as good now that (78:54 - 78:59)
that's out of the way sorry Travis oh (78:57 - 79:02)
that's alright I've been getting I I (78:59 - 79:04)
have not been getting a lot of favorites (79:02 - 79:06)
this week but I don't think there was a (79:04 - 79:08)
week of like a week or two ago when I (79:06 - 79:09)
was like three in a row so I'm yeah and (79:08 - 79:12)
I come up it's now maybe the first time (79:09 - 79:14)
anybody has mentioned me specifically in (79:12 - 79:20)
in mail no you get I know that we got (79:14 - 79:21)
that out of the way I have one question (79:20 - 79:24)
how should one start watching wrestling (79:21 - 79:27)
the topic is murmillo brought up on (79:24 - 79:30)
podcasters intrigued me and I saw in (79:27 - 79:31)
Houla there are some seasons of Raw and (79:30 - 79:33)
SmackDown but the problem is where do I (79:31 - 79:34)
start (79:33 - 79:37)
I don't need there's already too many (79:34 - 79:40)
people like peripherally involved in (79:37 - 79:42)
this I don't need the listeners of this (79:40 - 79:45)
show to also all watch wrestling because (79:42 - 79:48)
then then I'm just alone then it's like (79:45 - 79:50)
it's like now it's at least like (79:48 - 79:51)
theoretically there are some listeners (79:50 - 79:54)
who are in my boat who are like holy cow (79:51 - 79:57)
this wrestling thing is just sounds like (79:54 - 79:59)
a bunch of hot garbage at least I have (79:57 - 80:01)
camaraderie with a theoretical listener (79:59 - 80:03)
if all of the listeners all of a sudden (80:01 - 80:06)
start watching wrestling (80:03 - 80:08)
I'm just on my own and I can't handle (80:06 - 80:14)
that you could also just start watching (80:08 - 80:17)
wrestling no I'm a Contrave like (80:14 - 80:22)
everything I believe it's a really good (80:17 - 80:24)
time to be a wrestling fan if you're not (80:22 - 80:27)
watching American wrestling I want to (80:24 - 80:31)
give like a 30-second answer to this all (80:27 - 80:33)
right (80:31 - 80:36)
I don't even know where to start (80:33 - 80:36)
I would I mean lately what I've been (80:37 - 80:43)
telling people that have been that have (80:41 - 80:46)
said anything to me about like being (80:43 - 80:47)
interested in wrestling this is gonna (80:46 - 80:52)
sound really like I don't know it's it's (80:47 - 80:54)
gonna sound like really hip and I don't (80:52 - 80:56)
mean it to come off I know what you're (80:54 - 80:58)
gonna say and I disagree with you but go (80:56 - 81:02)
ahead I think the best thing for someone (80:58 - 81:04)
to do when they're interested in (81:02 - 81:07)
professional wrestling is to either (81:04 - 81:10)
watch one of two things to either watch (81:07 - 81:14)
a match that's ridiculous similar to (81:10 - 81:18)
like a young bucks match or make like (81:14 - 81:21)
maybe one of the like fashion Files (81:18 - 81:24)
matches where it's the Fashion Police (81:21 - 81:26)
like something ridiculous to get you in (81:24 - 81:28)
the mindset that like it's really (81:26 - 81:32)
self-aware these days or alternatively (81:28 - 81:34)
if you want something that's just really (81:32 - 81:39)
good athleticism to watch kenny omega (81:34 - 81:40)
versus okata (81:39 - 81:43)
which is like the highlight of (81:40 - 81:46)
professional wrestling right now see I (81:43 - 81:49)
yeah I disagree with you let's hear it I (81:46 - 81:52)
don't think somebody who does nothing (81:49 - 81:54)
about wrestling or where to start should (81:52 - 81:57)
watch one of the best matches of all (81:54 - 82:01)
times because I don't think they would (81:57 - 82:05)
understand the level of performance (82:01 - 82:08)
there it's like the way I think of an (82:05 - 82:10)
idiot the way I think of it is like this (82:08 - 82:15)
if I I watched like this is a weird (82:10 - 82:17)
analogy but to stay with me I watched (82:15 - 82:19)
Pulp Fiction (82:17 - 82:24)
when I was like 19 and I felt like if I (82:19 - 82:27)
would have watched it earlier like when (82:24 - 82:29)
I was like 14 or 13 I don't think I (82:27 - 82:32)
would appreciate it and I feel like (82:29 - 82:35)
wrestling is the same way of like there (82:32 - 82:38)
is so much going on that Minds tastes to (82:35 - 82:42)
enjoy a film about putting a watch up in (82:38 - 82:48)
one's nether regions I mean I watched I (82:42 - 82:50)
watched Pulp Fiction when I was like I (82:48 - 82:54)
don't know about that age like really (82:50 - 82:57)
early high school and I really enjoyed (82:54 - 82:58)
it (82:57 - 83:00)
you were probably way more mature than I (82:58 - 83:03)
was at that time well that's what I'm (83:00 - 83:05)
saying that about myself (83:03 - 83:07)
so what I would do this is what I would (83:05 - 83:09)
say this is my thirty second answer I (83:07 - 83:13)
would watch WrestleMania 33 which (83:09 - 83:16)
happened three months ago (83:13 - 83:20)
the most recent WrestleMania hmm there (83:16 - 83:22)
are only two bad matches on that card (83:20 - 83:25)
there's the Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton (83:22 - 83:28)
match that was bad but very interesting (83:25 - 83:30)
and then there was the Roman reigns an (83:28 - 83:31)
undertaker match that was kind of bad (83:30 - 83:32)
but that was mostly because the (83:31 - 83:37)
Undertaker being way too old otherwise I (83:32 - 83:41)
think that that pay-per-view gives you a (83:37 - 83:45)
good insight of what wrestling actually (83:41 - 83:49)
is and it's more of a performance and an (83:45 - 83:52)
actual show than it is about athleticism (83:49 - 83:55)
not discrediting that these people are (83:52 - 83:57)
extremely athletic and extremely (83:55 - 84:00)
talented they wrestle with the intent of (83:57 - 84:02)
not actually hurting the other person (84:00 - 84:05)
but in order to tell a story that's what (84:02 - 84:07)
I would do I would also say that (84:05 - 84:09)
WrestleMania xxx is a better (84:07 - 84:11)
WrestleMania but I think at that point (84:09 - 84:14)
it's so far removed from the current (84:11 - 84:17)
state of wrestling and I'm to a point (84:14 - 84:19)
now where I watch wrestling really (84:17 - 84:21)
pay-per-view buy pay-per-view yeah there (84:19 - 84:23)
is your your weekly Raw and your weekly (84:21 - 84:27)
Smackdown but I don't feel compelled to (84:23 - 84:29)
watch them regularly if I hear that (84:27 - 84:30)
there's something good or something (84:29 - 84:33)
interesting I will go seek that out (84:30 - 84:35)
but I think that every single (84:33 - 84:38)
pay-per-view that at least WWE does is (84:35 - 84:40)
really good at telling you why you (84:38 - 84:42)
should care about the match that's about (84:40 - 84:44)
to happen there's like a usually a two (84:42 - 84:47)
to three-minute like story of like why (84:44 - 84:49)
you should care about this and then the (84:47 - 84:52)
match actually happens that would that (84:49 - 84:55)
would be my suggestion yeah I mean I I (84:52 - 84:58)
think that at least I'm just going off (84:55 - 85:00)
of my personal experience like I found (84:58 - 85:03)
it way easier lately for people to watch (85:00 - 85:05)
a match and decide if they're into it (85:03 - 85:09)
way less likely that people will (85:05 - 85:11)
subscribe to like four hours of (85:09 - 85:14)
wrestling if they've never watched it I (85:11 - 85:18)
mean yeah but for that WrestleMania with (85:14 - 85:19)
a match I would recommend which was (85:18 - 85:23)
shane mcmahon vs AJ Styles did it really (85:19 - 85:25)
open with that yeah and that mat I mean (85:23 - 85:28)
it was a good match but it's again it's (85:25 - 85:31)
like that match was the best that's on (85:28 - 85:34)
the card oh I agree but of those of the (85:31 - 85:35)
stories for that night I think that was (85:34 - 85:38)
probably the weakest story so figure if (85:35 - 85:39)
it's like strictly from a story (85:38 - 85:42)
perspective like or you should be (85:39 - 85:44)
invested it's it's kind of weak it was (85:42 - 85:46)
and I was a good story it was it was a (85:44 - 85:49)
character who thought their general (85:46 - 85:51)
manager was screwing them over when in (85:49 - 85:53)
reality the general manager wasn't (85:51 - 85:54)
screwing them over but then they went (85:53 - 85:56)
too far and that what that's what led to (85:54 - 86:00)
the match yeah I mean I I'm still of the (85:56 - 86:04)
mind that like the the best introduction (86:00 - 86:08)
is something that shows you that it's (86:04 - 86:10)
not taking itself as seriously as (86:08 - 86:13)
everybody expects it to be taking itself (86:10 - 86:16)
so have you so if you were to do if you (86:13 - 86:17)
were to go to that route I think that's (86:16 - 86:20)
a good route I would do the Usos verse (86:17 - 86:24)
the fashion files at yeah what was the (86:20 - 86:28)
last pay-per-view called huh actly I'm (86:24 - 86:30)
the bank no it was that backlash it (86:28 - 86:31)
wasn't absolutely sure (86:30 - 86:34)
Oh money in the bank was new day versu (86:31 - 86:37)
soz i just want to add that quentin (86:34 - 86:40)
tarantino's an overrated director okay (86:37 - 86:42)
agreed Travis what's quite actually in (86:40 - 86:45)
his best movie his best movie is one (86:42 - 86:46)
that I'm not allowed to say on the show (86:45 - 86:48)
because it has a naughty word in it um (86:46 - 86:50)
but it's the one that has a naughty word (86:48 - 86:52)
in it not c1i (86:50 - 86:57)
yeah yeah I also really like Death Proof (86:52 - 86:59)
and I really like the kill bills but I (86:57 - 87:02)
think he's overrated generally I agree (86:59 - 87:04)
with you Travis give me the book amount (87:02 - 87:12)
of the week our Pokemon of the week our (87:04 - 87:14)
Pokemon of the week this week is (87:12 - 87:16)
Chauncey (87:14 - 87:20)
as Steve mentioned Chauncey was a bit of (87:16 - 87:23)
an interesting choice in the VGC (87:20 - 87:27)
tournaments going on right now so um (87:23 - 87:29)
Steve I'm gonna guess probably you'll (87:27 - 87:31)
talk about what you saw in the (87:29 - 87:32)
tournament because like I mentioned (87:31 - 87:34)
earlier in the show I was pretty busy (87:32 - 87:36)
this weekend so I haven't seen much but (87:34 - 87:38)
I can read out a set from our Pokemon of (87:36 - 87:40)
the week slack channel this one comes to (87:38 - 87:43)
us from slack user Gayle pretty much (87:40 - 87:45)
every Chauncey set is going to be using (87:43 - 87:47)
Evo light if it weren't it would have (87:45 - 87:49)
been a Blissey instead Evo late is an (87:47 - 87:51)
item that increases the defense and (87:49 - 87:53)
special defense of Pokemon that have the (87:51 - 87:55)
capability to evolve and so Chauncey is (87:53 - 87:57)
a perfect candidate because Chauncey is (87:55 - 87:59)
one of those Pokemon that has incredibly (87:57 - 88:03)
high HP so it already has a lot of bulk (87:59 - 88:07)
and when it evolves it mostly gains just (88:03 - 88:10)
a bit more bulk so Evo light tends to it (88:07 - 88:13)
ends up giving it more stats there's an (88:10 - 88:16)
argument to be had for maybe in some (88:13 - 88:18)
cases you would want Blissey with (88:16 - 88:20)
leftovers depending on the set (88:18 - 88:23)
especially in singles it's as I (88:20 - 88:24)
understand it it's more of a toss up (88:23 - 88:26)
actually I don't know now and gen7 that (88:24 - 88:29)
was the case in Gen 6 but so here's our (88:26 - 88:31)
double set for Chauncey with Evo light (88:29 - 88:35)
the ability is natural key or the EVs (88:31 - 88:38)
are 252 and HP 252 in defence and (88:35 - 88:40)
foreign special defense with a bold (88:38 - 88:46)
nature the moves are wish seismic toss (88:40 - 88:50)
toxic and protect so this is a set that (88:46 - 88:54)
it mainly attempts to stall out the end (88:50 - 88:56)
of the game so toxic is your main source (88:54 - 89:01)
of damage so put toxic poison on your (88:56 - 89:04)
opponents and then you alternate using (89:01 - 89:07)
wish and protect so that you are able to (89:04 - 89:08)
he (89:07 - 89:11)
recovering HP or and this is the reason (89:08 - 89:13)
you would want run wish as opposed to (89:11 - 89:16)
soft-boiled you can run wish and then (89:13 - 89:18)
swap out to another Pokemon that's (89:16 - 89:20)
damaged to have the wish land on that (89:18 - 89:22)
Pokemon you swap out wishes a move that (89:20 - 89:25)
increases your HP the turn after you use (89:22 - 89:29)
it so you can use wish and then swap out (89:25 - 89:31)
to a new Pokemon that new Pokemon gets (89:29 - 89:33)
the healing benefit of wish so that's (89:31 - 89:35)
why you would use it in some instances (89:33 - 89:37)
over soft-boiled which would heal you (89:35 - 89:39)
immediately because sometimes it's not (89:37 - 89:41)
chancy that you necessarily want to heal (89:39 - 89:43)
but near the end of the game your chance (89:41 - 89:45)
he's probably still alive because it's (89:43 - 89:47)
very tough to take down and then you (89:45 - 89:49)
hope that toxic is enough to just sort (89:47 - 89:51)
of Whittle the opponent's down as you (89:49 - 89:53)
stall out the game with wish and protect (89:51 - 89:55)
and then seismic toss is in there (89:53 - 89:57)
because chancy's offensive capabilities (89:55 - 90:00)
are very very limited so seismic toss is (89:57 - 90:03)
a move that deals damage equal to the (90:00 - 90:05)
pokemons level in this case that would (90:03 - 90:09)
be 50 damage because in VGC you play at (90:05 - 90:12)
level 50 so you at least get that much (90:09 - 90:14)
damage it's not a lot but sometimes you (90:12 - 90:16)
just need to do a tiny bit of damage to (90:14 - 90:19)
knock a Pokemon out as I understand it (90:16 - 90:25)
though the set that you saw in VGC was (90:19 - 90:29)
was a more healer oriented one with like (90:25 - 90:32)
heal pulse and the ability is the (90:29 - 90:34)
ability just called healer oh yes it is (90:32 - 90:38)
yeah so the the set that made top 10 and (90:34 - 90:42)
I believe they won their round so they (90:38 - 90:45)
moved on to I don't know how the bracket (90:42 - 90:47)
works I know I don't think it's a (90:45 - 90:49)
bracket I think it's by point system (90:47 - 90:52)
anyways they won their match with chancy (90:49 - 90:54)
the moves were soft-boiled seismic (90:52 - 90:56)
tossed heal pulse toxic nature was bold (90:54 - 90:59)
item was evil light ability healer so (90:56 - 91:02)
Michael was actually over when we saw we (90:59 - 91:04)
were we watched about two hours of the (91:02 - 91:06)
video game competent well we watched (91:04 - 91:08)
like a half hour video game competition (91:06 - 91:10)
because they they sat on commentators (91:08 - 91:15)
for an hour and a half but this chance (91:10 - 91:17)
he really stood out to me just because (91:15 - 91:22)
because I think it's it's very easy (91:17 - 91:26)
to look at a move set on paper and go (91:22 - 91:28)
okay I'm gonna do that but it's totally (91:26 - 91:31)
different seeing that in action (91:28 - 91:34)
so no discredit to Gabe's set that you (91:31 - 91:37)
read earlier when I looked at this set (91:34 - 91:39)
and I didn't see protect and Gabe (91:37 - 91:40)
recommended protect and I think (91:39 - 91:42)
protected this great move I'm not gonna (91:40 - 91:45)
discredit that I see why the the person (91:42 - 91:47)
who made top ten didn't run protect (91:45 - 91:50)
because you don't need it there was (91:47 - 91:53)
nothing that could that could one-hit ko (91:50 - 91:58)
Chauncey so instead of protecting just (91:53 - 91:59)
soft boil yourself and you're back to (91:58 - 92:02)
normal all the Pokemon I read off (91:59 - 92:05)
earlier not us there's there was like (92:02 - 92:07)
not a single fighting Pokemon in that (92:05 - 92:10)
mix there's just no active fighting (92:07 - 92:13)
pokémon that could actually one-hit ko (92:10 - 92:15)
chancy and I'm not saying that be (92:13 - 92:17)
mentioned Hariyama though right so there (92:15 - 92:18)
was I don't know it (92:17 - 92:19)
there was one Hariyama yeah you're (92:18 - 92:21)
correct there yeah so there was one (92:19 - 92:23)
fighting Pokemon out of you know the (92:21 - 92:25)
hundreds of our canines and top right (92:23 - 92:29)
goes that existed there was no move that (92:25 - 92:31)
I saw during all the games I saw this (92:29 - 92:33)
chance to compete and that even could (92:31 - 92:35)
get chancy down to half I think the only (92:33 - 92:36)
thing that could have came close was a (92:35 - 92:38)
Gyarados that was powering itself up (92:36 - 92:42)
over and over because chancy toxin did (92:38 - 92:45)
toxic it was almost it was pretty much a (92:42 - 92:47)
waste for that Gyarados to power itself (92:45 - 92:50)
up because it was wasting so much time (92:47 - 92:53)
powering it up and that time that I I (92:50 - 92:55)
totally forgot how much damage toxic (92:53 - 92:58)
does over time like it's so celebrating (92:55 - 93:01)
the first turn and then it just gets so (92:58 - 93:04)
wild as like it just dramatically (93:01 - 93:07)
increases there was with electric (93:04 - 93:10)
terrain out and with tapu coco doing it (93:07 - 93:14)
z move which is gigavolt havoc it it did (93:10 - 93:17)
like 25% damage to Chauncey and chance (93:14 - 93:19)
you just he'll pull a soft-boiled the (93:17 - 93:20)
next turn and it was back to full health (93:19 - 93:23)
it was just unbelievable (93:20 - 93:25)
was there a specific Pokemon that (93:23 - 93:28)
Chauncey was out there to use heal pulse (93:25 - 93:30)
on like there was there like a setup (93:28 - 93:32)
Pokemon that it was aiming to try to (93:30 - 93:35)
keep alive Chauncey never did heal pulse (93:32 - 93:38)
interesting that I saw it also never (93:35 - 93:40)
used seismic toss it would just continue (93:38 - 93:43)
to toxic every uh new Pokemon on the (93:40 - 93:45)
field so there was at one point all four (93:43 - 93:47)
of the opponent's Pokemon were poisoned (93:45 - 93:49)
if they weren't already knocked out and (93:47 - 93:51)
then it just continued to soft-boiled (93:49 - 93:55)
and it it never went below yellow health (93:51 - 94:00)
it just was incredible how considerate (93:55 - 94:03)
yeah like broken in competitive then (94:00 - 94:06)
because of that how it sounds to know I (94:03 - 94:07)
wouldn't consider it broken because if (94:06 - 94:09)
you had one fighting-type pokémon and (94:07 - 94:11)
uses dynamic punch there's no way (94:09 - 94:11)
Chauncey (94:11 - 94:15)
to survived it or just use taunt okay (94:11 - 94:17)
it's done (94:15 - 94:22)
like goodbye cuz then I can use the (94:17 - 94:25)
seismic toss and and that ain't great (94:22 - 94:28)
also my weights like that it's just a it (94:25 - 94:30)
just is it seems like a it seems like (94:28 - 94:33)
the person who ran it did a good job in (94:30 - 94:35)
reading the format and reading as you (94:33 - 94:37)
mentioned Steve hmm seems like there's (94:35 - 94:39)
not a lot of very strong fighting moves (94:37 - 94:43)
in them in the meta right now and also I (94:39 - 94:45)
don't know that a lot of people are (94:43 - 94:47)
running taunt this year cuz I don't I (94:45 - 94:49)
didn't see a single Tom from any of the (94:47 - 94:52)
movies I looked at I just know matter is (94:49 - 94:54)
leading the meta and realizing there's (94:52 - 94:56)
not a lot (94:54 - 94:58)
that people are running that happens to (94:56 - 94:59)
be able to counter it so that's just a (94:58 - 95:02)
good like not a choice I know the (94:59 - 95:05)
commentators said that if Gyarados could (95:02 - 95:08)
have gotten to I don't know what move it (95:05 - 95:10)
was using it wasn't Swords Dance but it (95:08 - 95:12)
was just a move to buff up your Gyarados (95:10 - 95:14)
dragon dance likely yeah dragon dance I (95:12 - 95:16)
know the commentator said if you're if (95:14 - 95:18)
Gyarados could get to dragon dances off (95:16 - 95:22)
and then do its move it would probably (95:18 - 95:26)
be enough to take out chancy and I (95:22 - 95:27)
believe them because they were they were (95:26 - 95:29)
pretty spot-on with with most of their (95:27 - 95:33)
calls but by the time Gyarados got its (95:29 - 95:36)
second dragon dance-off it was below (95:33 - 95:40)
half HP because of the toxic yeah and (95:36 - 95:44)
then its other Pokemon just used a move (95:40 - 95:48)
and finished Gyarados off and the person (95:44 - 95:50)
they were facing kept focusing on the (95:48 - 95:53)
Chansey which I'm not saying I'm good at (95:50 - 95:56)
competitive but after you realize that (95:53 - 95:59)
gigavolt havoc with electric terrain (95:56 - 96:02)
doesn't even come close to doing 30% (95:59 - 96:04)
damage to chancy I would have just (96:02 - 96:07)
continued focusing on the other Pokemon (96:04 - 96:08)
that were coming in and out and just (96:07 - 96:11)
leave chancy blast I don't know if that (96:08 - 96:12)
was a viable strategy but I guess that's (96:11 - 96:14)
what I would have done in retrospect (96:12 - 96:16)
because even both their Pokemon (96:14 - 96:18)
attacking Chauncey couldn't really they (96:16 - 96:20)
didn't have the right type matchup (96:18 - 96:22)
against Chauncey but there you go (96:20 - 96:25)
in Pokemon Red and Blue beta Chauncey (96:22 - 96:28)
was originally known as lucky Chauncey (96:25 - 96:30)
shares the same category with execute (96:28 - 96:32)
they are both known as the egg Pokemon (96:30 - 96:35)
Chauncey has the highest HP of all (96:32 - 96:38)
Pokemon that can involve excluding (96:35 - 96:40)
Arceus and so valley Chauncey and its (96:38 - 96:42)
evolutionary family has the most in-game (96:40 - 96:46)
items associated with them for example (96:42 - 96:48)
lucky punch lucky egg luck incense and (96:46 - 96:52)
oval stone Chauncey ties with the with (96:48 - 96:54)
Happiny for having the lowest base stat (96:52 - 96:57)
attack and defense of all Pokemon both (96:54 - 97:00)
at five and a shiny Chauncey is kind of (96:57 - 97:04)
this ugly egg color with green (97:00 - 97:07)
highlights (97:04 - 97:10)
it's really the color of an egg instead (97:07 - 97:13)
of being pink ah so yeah there you go (97:10 - 97:17)
and chances 100% female for breeding (97:13 - 97:18)
purposes I suppose in case you didn't (97:17 - 97:22)
know well that wraps up our episode for (97:18 - 97:23)

in the business but I think they're (98:47 - 98:50)
really fun videos I think they give you (98:48 - 98:51)
a good concept of what these gallery (98:50 - 98:53)
figures are I do think some of them are (98:51 - 98:54)
worth buying I think others are not (98:53 - 98:58)
worth buying I reviewed a cup from (98:54 - 99:00)
Pokemon Center I reviewed some pins from (98:58 - 99:03)
Pokemon Center I reviewed the Tommy Z (99:00 - 99:05)
ring that you can't get from Pokemon (99:03 - 99:07)
Center but you can get from like Toys R (99:05 - 99:09)
Us or Target or Walmart or whatever so (99:07 - 99:10)
lots of cool stuff I think they're funny (99:09 - 99:12)
I think they're better than the first (99:10 - 99:14)
four people seem to like the first four (99:12 - 99:15)
a lot those kind of a test run to see (99:14 - 99:18)

and said came to me with a great idea (99:55 - 100:00)
for a podcast and I wouldn't have to (99:57 - 100:02)
edit it or produce it or like do any of (100:00 - 100:05)
the work so essentially a friend came to (100:02 - 100:06)
me and said hey do you want to talk (100:05 - 100:08)
about a thing you like anyway every week (100:06 - 100:12)

I started a podcast called got it (100:15 - 100:20)
memorized where it's a Kingdom Hearts (100:17 - 100:24)
recap podcast because that series is (100:20 - 100:26)
block while the in terms of its cannon (100:24 - 100:29)
