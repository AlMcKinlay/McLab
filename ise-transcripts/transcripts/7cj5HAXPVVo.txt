[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 second episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and with me today I have Travis the best thing about Magikarp Trump is that every time I think I am finally done with the game and I hit the max trainer rank and I feel like I am finally freed from this skinner box prison I they release a new update and there's just like 20 more trainer ranks yes I'll talk about that speaking of talking we have Micah here I'm on the ludica Ludicolo episode of the podcast and I feel feel good about it who is this hello I think 272 ooh yeah oh yeah still in ludica Ludicolo episode selling Gen 3 I may have Gen threes don't anything right it was lotad and Luther Cola this Pokemon are stellar we got a show for you guys today we have some Pokemon news a little bit of Pokemon go Magikarp jump like Travis mentioned as we are recording this the finals to the Pokemon international US Champion it used to be called Nationals but now they called it the international US Championships are going on right now so we'll talk a little bit about that but like I said they're they're ongoing so we might not have final results as we are recording this but those will be up on Pokemon Championships calm we also have your emails and we have our Pokemon of the week this week which is chancy which was uses pretty well in the championship matches that I watched a little bit of but before we get to all of that we're gonna do a mini pokemon of the week right here very unorthodox that is very strange I was gonna say I don't want to read the the pokemons name but it's like the first thing in the biology but anyways I'll just read the biology we'll go from there I'll make it sound good it's definitely Ludicolo right no no no some of our listeners might recognize this from a couple episodes back all right here we go it feeds on the blood of both Pokemon and humans it is capable of it's capable of drinking over ten ounces that's 300 milliliters in Canada of blood in one sitting look golbat drinks so much blood that it's blood type will change to that of the victim following a feed no occasionally gorging itself to the extent that it might become too heavy to fly leaving it vulnerable in turn gold that is nocturnal and confound be can be found quite easily in caves you can't just use the word gorging in reference to blood just so casually I I didn't think it was possible to find yet another reason to hate the Zubat line but congratulations folks we found it 500 tragedy a couple of listeners both it on Twitter and slack after we talked about if put whether or not Eagle man had blood yeah they sent gold bat our way I think they also I think there was also again I this was like two weeks ago so I'm sorry I totally forgot to talk about it last week when I did have all the references in my mind but there was also like four specific episodes with Pokemon bleeding one of them being a baby Lucario so yeah gold but gold gold but no bug go bat pokedex entry mentions blood and there you go blood does exist in the Pokemon universe the horror show pokemon gold spot is my favorite Pokemon let's just get in the bulk of my news the first event of news here is softball bubbling news here look upon the Stars 3ds theme now available in Japan two brand new Pokemon based Nintendo 3ds themes have been released in Japan based on the Japanese merchandise lions Pokemon pop and look upon the Stars the theme Pokemon pop features a variety of Pokemon and artwork in the style of Japanese Pokemon merchandise line of the same name the background music is a mission at Festival Plaza from Pokemon Sun and Moon the theme Pokemon look upon the Stars features a Pikachu looking through a telescope alongside Cosmo and Lily's bag the background music is he ha he ha City Knight from Pokemon Sun and Moon the R or contains the artwork comes from the Japanese Pokemon merchandise line of the same name each theme costs 200 yen no details about a release outside of Japan but I want to say we got pretty much almost every if not all Pokemon 3ds themes here in America I just stopped buying them because I can't do it anymore you gotta save up for those switch themes yeah right yeah and evitable launched them Travis can talk all about all about this but let me let me read the article here this is from comicbook.com Magikarp Jump rolled out a new update last night adding two new Pokemon various other improvements to the game the update also adds four new types of Magikarp a new league for players to conquer possibly the most important update in addition to the new ultra League and a raised in maximum level cap for both player and their Magikarp if you grinded all the way through the previous leagues the new ultra League should provide something to do instead of beating the same expertly over and over the new update also improves the speed of the game removing some of the downtime between League battles you can also now skip every cutscene to go back to feeding and training your Magikarp in a hurry beating Ultra League will unlock the new pro old rod that will allow players to catch more Magikarp patterns the new Magikarp all have distinctive forehead pattern that come in white and gray variants mudkip and Evy were both brought to the game as support Pokemon this means that they will use their special abilities to help push magic up to greater heights Mudkip will give out an item every three hours while Evie's special ability will guarantee that magikarps a next training session will earn an amazing effort result in boosted JP gained Mudkip can be earned by beating the new ultra League and Eevee is available for purchase for four hundred diamonds in the game store a new Clefairy dalvik 500 according to unless there's a new update that reduced its price I'm looking at right now that it is 500 for Eevee breaking-news comicbook.com wrong on diamond count a nucleus a new collaborative decoration item can also be purchased from the store Travis will check the price here but we got 350 diamonds which will give Magikarp a 20% boost and JP from all other Pokemon skills that is correct finally two new food types added a castelia stone and a magic art biscuit are now available for purchase oh and also two new training exercise one one that features Magikarp flopping against a golem they don't say what the other training exercise is one is golem push and the other is soccer ball slam or soccer ball crush or whatever so the golem one is the same as the well I mean they're all the same that's all and then you get JP but the golem one takes the form of the dwell bull door and whatever the third one is push one or forretress yeah well is it as a heavy Pokemon sitting in front of you and your magic are plops against it to push it as far as it can the golem wants the same as those and then the soccer I think it's soccer ball slam let me see it is called soccer ball smash soccer ball smash that one is just like pokeball smash and the unfortunately named ball smash yeah yikes it's just like those where there's a ball of some variety sitting in one of those like it's a device that sort of mimics like like a tennis court tennis ball launcher yeah yeah cauldre turns against them to knock them away so I got pretty burned out a Magikarp jump I went down to playing once or twice a week I've been playing once a day now ever since the update I I'm really satisfied with especially more than anything else the speed changes but yes Travis tell me tell me how you feel about this update I'm curious about that to you because I completely stopped playing and I haven't touched it in weeks because of how slow it was the speed-up updates are pretty great I mean I would argue we're not there yet and what it needs to be for example the best it could be faster yeah the best part of the speed updates is that before when you went back to a league so the way it works is even if your previous Magikarp went all the way up to say the and beat the second to last Magikarp in that you know challenge run of that league and then lost to the final boss of that league your next Magikarp can't just start on the final boss has to be every single Magikarp along the way the game has always had the ability to hit a skip button that makes it so that you skip the majority of the won't when you skip all of the cutscene that shows the jumping happen and it skips right to the result but but two things are changed now one the animation of the screen that comes up that saying how many coins and experience you won I think that's a little faster and two importantly the sort of congratulations animation is like two or three times faster before it would be like congratulations you won then there's confetti then the next pokeball opens signifying that you are able to challenge the next person and then your character slowly walks to it now if that walk is brutal the walk is very brutal now if you hit skip the confetti happens as it skips to your character is already like halfway there your character walks a little faster than usual and the confetti in the pokeball open at the same time so it's much much quicker and much more tolerable same thing goes for events so in a previous episode of the show Steve and I complained about the many wise words event which man is a joke event where doesn't do anything it's a funny joke the first time that the you know the is he a professor I guess he's just the old man yes the mayor I think of the mayor that's yeah mayor comes yeah that's you're right he comes along and says like oh you know when I was your age and he gives you advice that is meaningless and it's funny the first time when you see nothing happened but then it doesn't only happen once it happens multiple times now you can skip events so many wise words still happens but if you've gotten that event before you can just hit the skip button and let's get past it thank God it's not perfect because battling a league is still incredibly slow if it's your first time through that league I don't know why they don't just have the increased and animation walking from one place to another all of the time and and not just when you happen to want to skip the the sort of challenge animation you can't skip the the main animation of the challenge if it's your first time battling that magikarp so you can't make the walking animation faster if it's your first time through that league so that's infuriating but like baby stops folks I do have a question for you so like when I was going through whatever was before the heel league I can't remember was it like great League or what at watch one are you talking about wellness league yeah the one that whatever what what league was before he league there's healing like quick league or fastly yeah yeah yeah it's fast league so I know so before Healey got released which was the the first major update to the game I was two gyms away from beating the game and not having quote-unquote beating the game and not having anything to do I think they call that expert league when I did finally beat fast League or whatever that league was called then he league was already there and I went into he league and now I'm almost done with he league and of course I'm like two gyms away two battles away from being done with he league they released this update for this new league so again I don't experience expert league but everything I heard is expert league is just nothing it's just pointless battles is is that well I mean you get experience and gold okay but like you know diamonds diamonds yeah but do you get that every time you go through the league no but you there are like three stages of the expert league you get it the first time you go through each stage of the expert league but then once you've beaten the third well I don't know anymore cuz I've I'm back at the first stage of the expert lead now that the update has happened so it might be more than three now but at least in the last update there are three stages to the expert league essentially like expert league one expert liek to an expert league three and the first time you go through one of those stages you get diamonds but then once you're at once you've beaten expert league three you just do expert league 3 through again you don't get diamonds but you get gold and you get experience ok and there's no badge correct interesting but now you have a whole new league to go through Travis oh I already did oh you went through it all ultra League yeah oh I'm on expert League one so now that you're back in expert league again after doing a whole nother week do you get diamonds or no yes but it's not the same expert League before when I did at expert league the all of the challengers were not as buff like know now that the level cap has increased the the Jaypee of all of the fish in the of the Magikarp and the expert League have increased and so accordingly you do get diamonds when you hit those levels those challengers whose number is divisible by 5 so I lost out on easy diamonds because I didn't make you to the expert League before this new league arrived that's correct unless I don't know how it works maybe when you go it won't I don't know who knows the the in-depth strategy of magic are chunk huh so now that you have so many questions so now that you've beaten ultra League and you're back to expert league are you going to continue playing because it sounded like before the update you are about to retire your cells are more tolerable now that the speed is increased it's so much more tolerable I don't know if this was answered in a previous episode but the burning question I have is have you spent any money no all right I spent probably 5 bucks or I think this you bet you did the special when they first watched yeah but it's good to hear that you can like not easily I guess but get through everything without having to spend anything yeah I never even really felt the temptation to spend it's not like one of those free-to-play games where it's like I don't know I I didn't feel like spending money would make me have any more fun so I didn't alright fair enough I also think there's a hard cap in what you can spend I don't think you can spend more than $100 in the game listen if I spend $100 on Magikarp jump but you can get that I give you the ability to take my phone away from me permanently you get the diamond miner if you spend I think you have to spend $60 and you can get the diamond miner $60 it's like it's it yeah magic rope jump so don't play video here you can't you get that without paying out money though you can't just diamonds you have to so the only way you can buy the diamond miner is by using the the pokey bucks and the only way to get pokey bucks is yeah the tickets is by spending money maybe it's well it's whatever maybe it's not maybe it's $40 I think you have to get the diamond miner it's whatever the the final purchases which I think might be Magikarp research right here menu purchase after five trade ends of 2,500 tickets you can get the diamond miner which is a hundred diamonds per day so you would have to spell out of diamonds that's a lot of diamonds you'd have to spend $40 you would have to buy the $35 option which gives you 2150 tickets and then you would have to spend the $5 option which gives you 250 tickets which then equals 2,500 tickets and then you can get the diamond miner and then you also get you get five trading so does three 3lp restores one powerup and then one sec of coins and then you get the diamond miner so $40 per that's that's $20 cheaper than other Triple A games that you can buy that's I mean this isn't a Triple A game still feel weird about a and B I still feel weird about spending $40 on a mobile game then you don't there's a there's no real like I the only reason you would really spend money on this is if you felt like you really needed all of the decorations and all of the support Pokemon I feel like that that's that's why you would spend the money is because I know that's what I'm saying I don't feel like that it's possible to get all the decorations without constant playing of the game yeah yeah I definitely agree like if you're trying to get all of the decorations and all the support Pokemon I can see why you would spend money I don't really care I'm just gonna get the ones that by you know just reading their descriptions think are the best like the next one I'm gonna get is Ganga like I already have the ones that I bought with diamonds that I earned in the game are meows which I pro or note me off you get from being a league so I have I bought like Lytton slowpoke and greninja and then the next one I'm gonna get is Gengar because I'm trying to make it such that I I'm sort of this sort of different ways you could go about playing the game I suppose one way is to try to maximize just things that give you coins so you would like max out like a Rowlett but what I want to do is just like blazed through generations of magic harps as quickly as possible and just earned coins that way by having them fight the league so once I get Gengar strat is gonna be all of my pokemon will have their support pokemon will have their abilities ready click greninja I get however many hundred million JP from that then I use slowpoke which returns one random support pokemons ability to being activated and since the only one whose ability isn't activated would be greninja at that point it's going to be greninja it can I hit games are it can't do itself now that would be a hilarious loop yeah and that's such a good strategy already I'm really excited and then he hit Gengar which increases the Jaypee you get for a brief period of time I think it's like by 50% over the next hour or something or maybe it's less than an hour and then I hit cringe again and I get however many million times 1.5 because of Gengar then I hit Litton and I get however many million times 1.5 because a gengar and then I hit Pikachu and I get however many million times 1.5 and I do all my trainings and then I hit Piplup get a training back and maybe hit Mudkip and maybe get a training so doesn't do another trading training and then they're in one sitting I've completely gotten a magic carpet - it's full - it's another level can you write that down somewhere I don't know if it's even the best rap but I can certainly get something I'll tell you it's the best strat I've heard because it's the only strata it has to be golden speaking of spending money in mobile games Pokemon go has now earned a total of 1.2 billion dollars in revenue across 750 2 million downloads according to app topia this article is off VentureBeat comm f topia is a NAPA telogen startup based in boston its total revenues for 2016 pokemon goes were 950 million so while 2017 made TV app making as many headlines in mainstream news the pocket monster catcher is still still has plenty of traction according to app topia 57.4% of the games players are male while 38 percent are Millennials ages 19 through 34 Pokemon go still attracts plenty of younger players with thirty two point five percent of its users being 18 years or younger Millennials can't buy houses because they're playing Pokemon go oh my god how much money have you sent in the Pokemon go uh I don't know you remember when I said I can't see spending forty dollars a mobile game oh I know that's why this transition was beautiful possibly the best transition I think I've done listen it it's it's very regrettable how many houses do you own out of made out of avocado toasted and one other one of the things are Millennials killing uh they're killing computers well I I saw this this morning Millennials are killing sit down eat restaurants like Applebee's or Buffalo Wild Wings good riddance prior to Pokemon go fest I spent seventy dollars in Pokemon go I believe I spent $20 on the very first day which I felt was needed for me to properly report on the game and seeing what money could get you I think since then I spent $10 $20 and then another and maybe two more sets of ten or one more set of 20 I looked through my app a purchase history and then because I secured a Pokemon go fest ticket and because I plan on going I spent $40 recently mostly because I knew 20 of those dollars would go to increasing my bag size from 1000 to 1500 and for me I I mean I don't need to defend my purchase I feel good about it just not throwing away stuff and being able to hold more stuff makes me feel way better than being like stressed out of like I have 200 pokeballs but I don't want to throw those pokeballs away because of the Pokemon go Plus burns through pokeballs and I don't want to throw my potions away because though I'm doing gyms a lot more I don't throw my revise away because I'm battling at gyms a lot more so just having more bank space makes me feel really good and then their leftover money I will be using for when I go to Pokemon go fest so I have like 2500 coins still left I don't know that I want to know this but wait where can you look at your at Purchase History it might be easiest on a computer that's how I always do it you just go to iTunes and then you go to you account info and then you hit purchases and since Pokemon go is only a year old you just have to look for the last year of purchases in iTunes I don't know that I actually want to do that maybe I don't know that I need to subject myself to that Travis has been a full week since the update I know you were dabbling with Pokemon go a little bit are you still into it as this update changed your mind are you playing more Magikarp jumped is taking everyone I just been jumping for joy I haven't really been playing Pokemon go don't play Magic a drum so much now that it's a slightly better game I I've been playing it almost exclusively over pokemon go you heard it here first magic harbour jump better than Pokemon go take them actually pretty much actually maybe I've been playing a lot of Pokemon go I try I have gone three or four weeks hitting my hitting both my pokey stop am i catching streaks my pokedex is over 200 now I just told you the amount of money I've spent Myka and I did some raiding yesterday we did six or seven raids in a row Myka do you ought to talk about that experience I lost a Terry editar that's the experience I was very salty but I got a muck so that's cool it's it's been fun like I I also have hit my catch and stop goal like streak for I don't know three three weeks or whatever in a row for three or four weeks and I don't think I ever did that when I was originally like when I was first playing this is definitely the most I've played since I stopped playing last year I've had like a huge increase in the Pokemon I have in my pokedex and that's been really fun it's like every day is like three or four new entries I don't know it's just it's been good i I've enjoyed it a lot and it's gotten me out of the house a lot which is really like to me has been in because by I work from home so I don't ever leave the house I like it's rare that I put pants on so it's getting me out every day into the sunlight I was like Micah tell me about the raids in Pokemon go and you missed the whole interaction we had with like three strangers oh yeah that's right I forgot about those guys yeah I could I could say that all right that's like kind of frequent though right like we tend to see people a lot more frequently like out rating like even yesterday we went to a mall here Mayfair and there was a we were just looking for Ray it's driving around looking for raids and we found one at the mall so we stopped at the mall and we walked to like where it was and there's a mom and her son outside where the raid was happening just just playing and we at first we like all that moms just on her phone and then we heard them discussing Pokemon ghosts rats together but the best part was the mom was playing Pokemon go the little kid wasn't correct and seemed very impatient with like mom taking so long at the raid what was really cool was yesterday when we were done at Mayfair and we were out looking for raids we pulled over to a church and there was a mock raid that was the muck that Micah needed it's it's me Irene and Micah in a car or you know we're in a parking spot in front of this church doing this raid and we see that two other people are in the raid so naturally you look around and we see two dudes vaping in a truck in the in the church parking lot we were like that that has to be them and so we finished the raid and they they as soon as the raids done and the Pokemon is caught I think I think everyone caught the muck you see the car slowly back out and like kind of pull in front of us because we were near the entrance of the church and they do a little wave and then I do a little wave and then I was like ah screw it and I pulled out my window and I was like hey did you guys catch that muck and they're like yeah I was like are you gonna do more raids and they were like yeah yeah we are and I was like well there's like five of us if we can probably do level 3 or level four raids cuz luck is a level 2 raid so it it's pretty easy to do a level 2 solo if you're if you're high enough level so they were like hey we'll just follow you in your car just drive wherever you want and we'll follow you and they legit did and we we like drove around and looked for some raids and then we couldn't find any so I pulled over into a grocery store parking lot and they pulled up next to me and they were like hey we got this app that helps us do some more raids there's like a raid 10 minutes away if you wanted to do that and I was like yeah sure I'll follow you so we drive over to that and that's when we there was magic our break into an alley and they stole they took our avocado toast they took all my points so we did like a magic art braid and a Vaporeon raid and another non muck another muck because we were waiting for this level for when we got there it was 30 minutes to the level 4 raid so we didn't know what it was going to be so alone for could be a Charizard a Blastoise Venus or a Tran ATAR and I think a Dragon Knight anyway it's just like stage 3 Pokemon so we're like giving each other thumbs up because like we're parked either in front of each other behind each other and so we're driving it to all these raids and then finally the Tyranitar raid pops and it's it's like 34,000 CP so it's one of the top tier terrain Attar's and at that point there's only five of us and the guys in the car they were like I don't know if we can do this we did a trance heart earlier and there was 11 people and we got through it ok but I don't know if we can do it with 5 and Micah was very adamant in trying I was very adamant and just like if we're gonna fail we're gonna fail I don't care yeah and I'm I'm to the point where like I don't want to fail because that's a dollar because you can only do one rate for free and if you if you planned out you can technically do two rates for free in a day but that's only if you didn't do your raid before the day before so I've already I'm already like five dollars in for the day for raids so I was like ok well let's just do the Tranter I've never done well for I don't know how hard it is the weirdest part is all these raids were in like a Veterans Park so not only are there and it's a Veterans Park that is under construction so there are all these historical buildings everywhere that are surrounded by 10-foot high fences with barbed wire above it that says no trespassing because everything there is being remodeled and there's a bunch of memorial tombstones everywhere so it's like ah it's yeah when you say Park it's not like it's not like a park that families go to like this is definitely like a memorial park right and to be clear we weren't trespassing where we were we you could be yes yeah totally it's it was almost like though it to me it felt like we were in where they would film ghost hunting stories just because of all the fences and barbed wire and these buildings that and there was no one there we were the only people there these buildings are just ancient buildings and they're they're under a remodel like they're fixing them up but that's why the fences are there so when the terrain ATAR raid was about to pop we had to drive down this really like narrow road to get to it and it was at one of the historical buildings and so when we got to the end of the road it was just a huge fence blocking the building with like no way to turn around without backing straight up I like a half-mile so we're like awkwardly parked at the end of this dead-end street in front of this what seems to be a haunted house waiting for Tyranitar to pop and it popped so five of us joined and then all of a sudden a six person joined so we're like talking between cars and looking around and I'm like guys you got a third person in the back of your car cuz I'm not seeing a sixth person here and they were like no no no so I'm assuming the person was on the other side of the building but anyways we're the most reasonable story is that it was a ghost train er yeah yeah or they were in the building yes a ghost trainer on a ghost train yes okay well let's just do the raid this the six guys willing to commit we can't see where he is but the countdown timer started so we start the raid we go through Tyranitar has like maybe 10% health left but we have about 15 seconds on the clock so we're all like screaming and excitement really happy and then with five seconds left it goes you have failed the raid and we're all like what we have yet just booted everybody we have five seconds range so I was like we we we were going to we were going to do this this is possible a fun fact for people who haven't done harder raids when you use a raid pass you're good for the entire duration of the raid so you can actually do the raid as many times as you want until the rate is over um as many times as you want how do I say this if you succeed you're good but if you keep failing you can still do it if that makes an hour you can yeah you can go back in you can even leave and then come back yeah you just you'll if you leave you lose the party that you're with when when we failed we were like we don't understand why it ended five seconds early but we can definitely do this so I I switched one or two Pokemon around and they started they got back into the red because it's it's free for the hour once you initiate the right pass and we saw that's the sixth invisible guy the ghost we saw that the ghost joined back up against we're like okay good there's still six of us ghost guy is in two guys in the car in all that my car is in so we I think we can do it this time and we did it we finished probably with two seconds left I want to say Micah it was very very close it was very close and so I think I only got five pokeballs or five premier balls I think Eirene Micah did you also get five it was a Valor Jim so I know valor people got more they get like a three if if a raid is on a gym that you own you get a bonus three balls so I think the lowest count of balls you can get is five and the highest count of balls you can get is 13 so I was able to catch the Tranter I have never felt so stressed - so excited in a matter of like two minutes of being like I have only five balls to catch this trance heart I want to train her so bad and being able to catch it Irene caught it Micah you didn't have I alternate of Li went from being the most stressed to the most disappointed in the shortest amount of time I did not catch Terry outs are as vit I was very disappointed I mean I was disappointed in that like I was disappointed that I didn't catch it but I still had a really good time doing it and that seems to be like generally how raids are for me cuz I think the first one I would like I was salty the first time we did a raid and it was I don't remember what it was bay leaf or something and I did I didn't catch it and that was more of frustration in the moment that I didn't understand like I don't understand how the rules work so I was like I just used my rate pass and I'm leaving with nothing and that's really dumb but once you explain like oh you get XP you get items which I skipped past all of that because I was more excited about catching the Pokemon than anything else then it made more sense and now it's more like it's cool to get the experience whatever and it's even better when you catch the Pokemon but just doing the raid in general especially when it's something really challenging like that which is why I like doing even if there's like potential for failure I that's why I like doing the raids like that because the challenge and the excitement of doing it is I feel still rewarding even if you don't catch the Pokemon all I said is and and done I exchanged numbers with the with the two guys in the car and we went on our way but yeah it was it was a really cool experience raid huntin got to Martin news articles here and then we'll take a break first bit is off Kotaku titled nobody thought a competitive pokemon player would win a four verse one but he did this is what happened this happened yesterday here competitive pokemon players usually forfeit a match with seemingly unbeatable odds but the first day of the North American Pokemon international championship is a perfect lesson in why never giving I can pay off must be a John Cena fan giovanni casa this season's quote-unquote evey player found himself facing down one of the most talented players from germany tobias kisaki in the third round of the tournament kosowski was using a team of smeargle porygon z Arcanine tapu bulu hari Mara and nollie go which recently finished Hariyama and he'll ago yeah whatever the the squid thing yeah he'll ago or nil he go I don't the splatoon Pope I heard him yesterday calling it nightly go which I feel like is just a really literal like yeah I mean that was he recently finished in the top four of the Japan national championships Kosta made some major updates to his previous evie team within sinner or taboo Coco whimsicott taboo fini Dragonite and accompanying evolution Pokemon and accompanying the evolution Pokemon they have helped him throughout the secured set to win so is this guy just using a pure Eevee probably extreme Evo boost or whatever the Eevee's yes so Evie has a very good z move where all of its stats are boosted by two stages when you use it however things start looking grim for the Eevee player he eventually lost Game two and was forced into a final match to determine the rounds overall winner Kosta went for his typical Eevee strategy trying to boost its stats before giving them to another Pokemon with baton pass but on the second turn Nellie go and Hariyama made it impossible for that plan to work costa's entirely strat entire strategy was shaken despite costa's effort Kizashi dismantled the rest of the team except for one Dragon Knight at the time dragon dragon Knights demise seemed like a done deal after all it was four against one even the commentators who generally try to never give up on a player's chance of winnings seem to call it you can hear around the twenty five minute mark in the video above I was right the first place at extremely low boost increases your all of you user stats which is gonna be Eevee cuz an Eevee exclusive Ziva move increases all of the stats by two stages so that's a lot and then you use baton pass theoretically to pass it to something that has higher base stats than Eevee got it huzzah she made a mistake after putting Dragonite to sleep the turn before he switched out to his smeargle for a hit for a heavily damaged Hariyama and instead of going for the safe protect to ensure the win he went for hidden power ice with his Niall ego the move was four times super effective and left Dragonite with only 13 HP then despite it being a 33% chance Dragonite woke up what's more his kostas Dragonite was packed with earthquake which could finish off both Hariyama and nile ego the crowd exploded with excitement which is even audible on stream when you can see first hand at the 27 minute mark in the video Kosta was still in it after that the whole the whole game came down to whether smeargle could deal 13 damage with a single with its single only attack fake out which works only on the first turn the users on the field it was either that or stall out the rest of the team by putting Dragonite back to sleep with Spore because the timer had run out and the players only had three turns left to decide their to decide a victor Koski could have went for a tiebreaker if it's smeargle kept its own HP above 13 hit points Koshka went for the first option and did only nine points of damage surviving with for surviving with only four HP Dragonite finished the game off and granted Kosta a win that seemed almost impossible it was a match that proved preserving its Pokemon is possible even when all seems lost incredible but there is a video on Kotaku that highlights the entire match I have never heard of this Eevee strategy until now sounds very cool yeah it's not like top tier or anything because it's as if we've mentioned before on the show it's always risky to run a strat that's very much based on pulling off a a setup early on in the match the because as is the case here there are times when your setup gets interrupted and then you end up in really bad circumstances fortunately in this case for the evie player sounds like he was able to end up in that terrible circumstance but still claw a victory which but I mean just by the very nature of the fact that that's newsworthy shows that like it is a very hard circumstance to call yourself out of when you fail to set up the sweep so they can be a fun strat and it's it can be really punishing when it when you aren't able to prevent your opponent from setting it up it can feel like incredibly one-sided but right now I just wanted to highlight some of the Pokemon being used here before we take a break in the north american international championships I'm just gonna run through some Pokemon let me know if anything stands out to you as being unique we have a lowland Persian Snorlax top of cocoa our canine taboo Finney and cart Anna that's one team we got a Lola nine tails Garchomp our canine tapu cocoa Castelli ax and Snorlax well what was the what was the one before Snorlax castelia osela Stila Sela Stila yeah sorry got it we have pelipper gold duck cart Anna tapu Layla Metagross and tapu cocoa the so far a lowland Persian I think is probably the one with the lowest with the least usage generally like that one is the one that surprises me so far okay net the pelipper no because pelipper has drizzle okay we have muds dale muck a lowland muck top of cocoa porygon to our canine nine eleven nine tails porygon a twofer that's a strange team there but yeah porygon to formosa nile ego sally ste leah our canine gastro don is a running theme here our canine Garchomp Sela Stila tapu cocoa Snorlax mimic you this is the team where well this is one of the pokemon on the team we're highlighting for Pokemon of the week but we have our k9 buzz wall Chauncey Gyarados Metagross and tapu Coco and I think we're getting into repeat repeats now yeah we have a top abbulu bulu smeargle mimic you another lowland persian for the first a little in persian travis since you said that stood out to you it's moves were parting shot foul play feint and fake out holding a leper pas berry ability fur coat nature Jolly oh yeah I don't know what yeah Papa berry does mmm not sure what that item does but parting shot is a cool move it's like it's a move sort of like volt switch or u-turn in that it has its effect and then the Pokemon switches out but instead of dealing damage lowers the attack and special effect special attack of the target so iqu you can lower their the opponent's offenses and then swap your Pokemon out so it's a cool move not a lot of Pokemon have it it used to be exclusive to Pancham and pangoro that line but in the in Sun and Moon SIL Valley has access to it and then you can breed it into a lowland meows okay so it's breathable mm-hmm gotta work for it you're saying that's correct let me look up what yeah Papa berry does okay oh yeah no wonder I didn't I didn't know exactly what berry this was it's one of the many where pokémon's health is restored by half when its HP drops to 1/4 or below there's a whole bunch of them because like depending on the nature of the Pokemon it might have the effect of confusing them so for instance with yup a blueberry you don't want to put it on a Pokemon with a lonely mild gentle or hasty nature because it will confuse them and there's just a whole bunch of berries that have the same effect but confuse different natures and I I don't have all of them memorized got it interesting they're interesting traces of Wendy's and one not to use it because like citrus Barry restores less HP but it does trigger at a higher HP threshold just real quick we'll run on the what TCG decks are made made it into masters we have a Zoroark break as one deck next deck is volcanion tirta Nader following deck is allall the ninetails then we have a deck consisting of DRAM Pagar border we have a greninja break deck we also have a decidua ll the ninetails deck and ade this is you i vileplume deck and then finally sensing a theme fine finally another trampa garbodor deck so TCG focused seems like we have a little bit of a variety at cdc gy being used in two different decks trampa garbodor e being used in two different decks but some different decks being used if we get some results here we'll probably report on this a little more in depth next week Mike and I watched about two hours but I mean besides watching people battle and some commentators I don't think anything to notable to report so that's sweet chancy though but we'll get to that after our break chancy yeah the time we saw the back side of buzz wall which I don't think either of us have ever seen before she's really terrifying yeah normally when I catch pokemon I box them right away I don't actually use yeah we'll take a break here we'll be back with our emails and our Pokemon of the week so sit tight we will be right back you're gonna think outside of the box yeah and outside of the bun I mean that's a pretty good saying and we are back from our break and we are gonna do some emails so if you have any questions comments or concerns you can send those emails over to SB j at pkmn cast comm or you can go to pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button both will get to me alright this email is from Sophia from the in the PS they said how their town is spelled here yak yeah ma Yakima Washington is PJ and crew it's nice to know that someone from Yakima listens to this podcast oh I think there was there are Yakima last week too yummy what this person is responding to yeah connecting yeah commence all over actually just in Yakima I wanted to know with pokemon ultra Sun and ultra moon coming out which pokemon do you want to get a lowland form and why design ideals for said pokemon uh Sophia I don't think we have any aloe and Pokemon that were originally ghost-type so that would be interesting to see like in a lowland gastly that's what I was gonna say hello and ghastly but only because I want to see if a lowland Gengar cuz it's you know there's like no practicalities and other than I just want that it is possible though to just have a lowland Gengar because we don't have a low and execute that's not a thing that's true right I just want moral olan Pokemon that just are the same Pokemon but with cool hair like piglet and Doug Dan actually do you have an example yes you do there's that yeah that is that is a thing that happened to you it does I just want that do you guys think that will get generation 200 and Pokemon or are they really going to again tackle well they could do no a lowland Pokemon that's that's the thing but I don't know if I would want them to touch more generation 1 Pokemon and I feel like what's theirs great yeah I had kind of assumed that they weren't I don't know why I just assumed that the new stuff that we would see it would be like like there wasn't anything really new aside from like the kyurem forms in black 2 and white 2 right they didn't introduce anything essentially yeah like no new Pokemon except maybe some of the event Legendary's were released after the release of that I can't quite remember and the same thing with like omega ruby and alpha sapphire i don't know i just assumed that there they weren't going to introduce anything new aside from like all 4 new mega is in alpha and omega ruby alpha oh yeah that's true that's true was I was thinking of like was there a legendary Pokemon that got released during black and white and black and white - that was only obtainable in black and white - I think it was just curious karyam forms yeah like you couldn't get black curium or white curium in black and white one that was specific her black and white - you needed DNA splicers but you could get cure cure him yeah yeah yeah I mean if they do that's cool I'm I'm really into the lowland forms I think they're cool and unique and everything and it would be cool to see more of it both of you give me one a lowland form you'd want to see from generation to mmm Dunsparce alright I don't know how that's worse this like so particularly what it is I don't even know how you I think I think Anna loli loli and I think in a low and mareep laughs II and Ampharos very interesting and they already got Megas that's true that like a thing though the kid don't there's there's no there's no a lowland form that also has a mega form right until now oh maybe maybe I'd really like to see in a low and politoed actually I feel like Polly toads already alone no I'd like to see a polytope that's an alone and politoed that looks more like Poliwhirl I feel like Slowking blossom and politoed all already fit like some aloe in tropical theme I may be mellow I'm this is going back a little bit but maybe meloetta wasn't released until after the release of black 2 and white 2 oh yeah oh I think you could get it on any of the games but steering logic here we go the case a lowland [ __ ] wrath what Oh under a furry yeah would it just be like a long-drawn the only thing they should do to it is just reverse its colors there's like instead of the front being yellow the front is brown and instead of its butt being brown its butt is yellow perfect what a cool poke when I heard what when I know you didn't I know well it's obviously it's obvious already that the pronunciation was off but I thought you said hello and jyggalag which is the main villain from the Elder Scrolls for oblivion Shivering Isles expansion and the idea of a beach vibes version of the terrifying giant suit of armor that's the Daedric prince of order is something I am very interested to him I've never been so happy to hear anybody talk about elder scrolls for oblivion before all right what if we have a lowland dawn fan and instead of being what is donphan just ground yep oh it should be ground electric and when it rolls it builds up electricity I'm sold and that's that's farther than anything I've been able to come up with I was thinking like ground fire but I think we already had like Mara cargo and slugma that generation which i think is ground fire yeah rock fight rock phone plug Mysterio and magcargo is rock sapphire rock I'm just pandering at this point but what about on a lowland piloswine I mean I wasn't gonna say it because that would just be a little too obvious coming from you cliche but I mean like I'm not gonna say no let me ask you if you could if you could have an aloe and pilot pilot wine what would be the difference from original piloswine so that's ice ice ground right yeah it is originally ice cream I mean give me the type you me the type change let's do ground flying it just gets so it just puffs up so much and get so fluffy that it just like is so not dense that it is less dense than the air and just floats up to the sky into the heavens where it belongs from what the humidity it's like you know yeah all right no actually even better it it it's a little I flap suffer they form giant like hot-air balloons but make it like a lighter than air durable and it just carries it so drifter if flume has some competition yep what would it ruin piloswine for you if a lowland pile of swamp because the red head is still there if a lowland piloswine had visible eyes we've seen pylos wines eyes in the on ma are they terrifying and they're great I've never seen this yeah I think so I can't quite remember I think they're just eyes The Fixer just I yeah I mean just like you're normal you're like average ordinary oh yeah oh yeah there's just a little little button eyes they're pretty cute yeah yeah Jonathan Wrightson says I need to know if anyone else thinks this is insane see attached image I'm a huge Gen 2 fan I'll get to the image I am a huge dent to fan probably my favorite generation that being said I would have a hard time paying more than $100 for this nice looking set of badges attached is an image of the framed gym badges of Johto on Pokemon Center calm but for a hundred and eighty dollars for eight badges that aren't even made with silver or any type of interesting stone that's absurd is it not they look nice but I'm fairly certain I remember TCG events where they gave gym badges away for free I apologized for the Pokemon Center rant but can you reason out the paying for this Steve you're a good dude well as a total sweetheart Travis seems like a pretty good dude that the metal what he's that metal what screams they did in the Burgess song was dope thanks for your time at oh it's just Johnny have you guys seen the premium Johto gym batch that I saw the they do the canto said didn't they yeah it was I saw that uh $180 I could probably justify the price here please do cuz I'm I'm in what was their name Johnny I'm in Johnny's court right now so please justify I'm not sure the quality of badges because they're behind glass here and I dunno I I do have some of the original toys-r-us League badges I do as well those are like your simple pins whereas speaking speaking of reviews and bad quality I this week the week of this episode there will be a bunch of my Pokemon Center reviews on the YouTube channel youtube.com slash pkmn cast and one of those reviews are I don't know if it'll be this week or next week because I recorded 10 different reviews one of those reviews were the Pokemon Center Hoopa confined in Hoopa unbound Pokemon pins so those pins are $12.99 which comes down to about 650 a pin and I would say the quality of those pins are years better than the toys-r-us Jim League badges that you got back in like 2000 is it possible that's because it's been years since no no just like the the back plunger and the thickness and the enamel they use well on their die cut too like the Pokemon toys-r-us badges were just like rectangles that they had like a I don't know like a print it wasn't like they had any kind of bevel or embossing or like filled enamel or anything like that it was really really basic you do $12.99 which is two pins and you times that by four to equal eight you're looking at about $52 for pins so that leaves a hundred and twenty dollars of what am I paying for there at that point as somebody who has hosted two art shows and have has done framing and cutting and sealing I think a lot of people don't realize how expensive it is to frame something professionally and that's what you're getting with the gym badges of Johto and the gym badges of Kanto not to mention that you get free shipping over fifty dollars so I'm assuming that yeah shipping is probably just built into the cost yeah I'm assuming that twenty to thirty dollars of this one hundred eight eighty dollars is dedicated directly to the shipping and making sure that the glass here doesn't break and the frame here doesn't get dented any other insurance costs because you are gonna get free shipping on this that leaves about $90 for the actual frame itself which is actually it should be more expensive yeah I just framed Irene's diploma and if I didn't with with a coupon it was a hundred dollars to professionally frame that diploma here's the deal though you're going to a place where there they're doing that one time for you this is a this is a difference between like a situational framing like I did a lot of framing to because I went to art school and we had a lot of galleries and we had to frame professionally to make it look nice and it was expensive and it sucked but that's you know student loans we did it uh and a big part of it was always that it was you were doing it it like as a single person in a shop where there's like two or three people working that are doing it for you and this is obviously a product that's like being mass-produced products being mass-produced there are so many 400 to 500 items on Pokemon Center comm I don't think this is getting mass-produced they probably made 100 or 200 of these I mean it's not it's hard in its not to say that it's not hard to frame that framing sucks no it does suck it totally sucks but it's not hard to produce a hundred to two hundred of one like like pieces of frames that you're then assembling for way cheaper than what it would cost to do that for one piece like it's a really significant difference I would I would be okay with like maybe it it's like 40 to $50 $100 of the cost no way that product frame itself is probably $30 the actual border canvas and there's probably ten so you're at $50 there and then somebody's work to like cut that frame and they could be buying it but I doubt it because of I have the actual size of the frame here it's it's ten by five not to mention the fact that three that's not this financial breakdown assumes then that they're making zero profit on this which i extremely doubt no they're probably making profit but I I don't think that this is overpriced I don't think a hundred and eighty dollars for this Pokemon Center item is overpriced Pokemon Center comm there are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve different pieces of artwork framed by Ken's Sugimori probably not framed by Ken Sugimori but the artworks by him for $250 each so I am assuming that they are using the same exact frame company that they are using for the kantou premium gym set and a Kanto or that the johto premium gym set I mean it still says it's made in China so I mean we can assume all day that it's like framed here and it's really nice and high quality and everything and it may be nice and high quality and everything but it still could at the end of the day be made in China where it's incredibly cheap to produce and it's true we don't so we don't know the paper quality we don't quality I don't think I'll tell you I'll be the first to tell you as an artist when when you buy something that's framed you're paying for the frame but you're paying way way more for the art if you're paying for the art you're not paying for the printing and the framing and all that like especially in situations like this words it's very likely man what do you even if you're well there's only 50 there all these are limited 50 runs so yeah it's still being mass-produced they made one thing they've made it 50 times and now they're selling it that's fine when no one's questioning that if you're going to let's say they get rid of the frame and you don't want to buy the frame and they sell the piece for a hundred and twenty dollars so you're just getting the print itself mm-hmm I don't know you tasty profit margin yes no it's not I don't know anyone who would buy a hundred and twenty dollar piece of art and then just put it in like a $10 frame you could you absolutely could and it would work and you could hang it on your wall but the whole point of professionally framed art is not only is it sealed so dust and debris doesn't get inside usually the glass is UV protected so then when it's sitting on your wall and the Sun shines on it the actual artwork doesn't fade I think that you are giving I think you are not even enough credit for how oh absolutely I am it is truly a piece of art work but what I'm saying is they don't have like a shop that they're mailing these to in the United States that's framing these and it's it's like what you would pay or I would pay to go and have something framed they're doing this through probably a manufacturer in China I mean it's a description it literally says in the product description country of origin printed in Japan frame made in the USA I don't litter makes it badges which just says country of origin made in China I guarantee I guarantee you those badges are made in China but the frame and the canvas are exactly the same on this and the other one so I'm assuming they're getting framed in the USA near the Amazon ship center that they're shipping to I think the only solution here is that you need to buy these and then get them for YouTube channel one I have a theory what if stay with me here what if the person in charge of curating the Pokemon Center online shop was told that the new games feature a lowland forms and misheard and thought the person said a lowland frames and was like gosh I guess we need a lot of rain a ton of rain now I will gladly admit I'm wrong if if I was to get my hands on one of these and it was like cheap Plexiglas and the the mat was just poorly cut or hand cut badly or just a really thin like those thin mats you get when you buy a frame at michaels that are just like see-through when you hold up the light like what I'm seeing at the pictures is I'm seeing double matted prints which is usually a little bit more expensive than just a single mat and it also looks way better but I will definitely eat my lunch if if there's I guarantee you it's probably glass and it's probably like it's it's probably what's the term compressed wood what's the the the quality of the frame yeah whatever the the material is compressed wood I can't remember them yeah is it doesn't doesn't say in any of the descriptions what I guarantee you it's still gonna be like it's gonna look and feel quality because it's still the Pokemon company like they're not gonna go through a Chinese manufacturer that's gonna make it look and if the frame is made in the US that's fine that's not necessarily saying that it's manufactured in the US or that it's put together in the u.s. I mean frame in the US send it to China and then send it back I feel like maybe but I mean the cost it's significantly different than if you or I were like oh we should sell some Ken Sugimori art and have it framed and then mail it to people like this is a company that knows what they're doing and knows profit margins yeah but that doesn't what I'm saying is that doesn't mean the framing is not like people don't understand how much it is to frame something I agree with you that it's underestimated how much it costs to frame stuff but that's when it's URI and we're going to Michaels or we're going to not Michaels we're going to the Great Frame up or whatever like also by the way framing stores have the worst pawn names of all time but that's beside the point uh but you're right it is it is typically it is taken for granted how much it costs to to print and frame stuff all right this is emails from Gabriel from somewhere in Canada at all Ottawa how do you say it Travis Ottawa ah de Ottawa ash awhat hi my name is Joshua my name is Gabriel I'm a new listener I've been catching up on episodes I just listen to episode 264 where you guys talk about sound tight Pokemon this might be late to the discussion but here are my thoughts flying would definitely be strong against sound as wind can easily drowned out sound also sound types should be strong against psychic as noise can destroy disrupt the concentration of psychic users my love of Skyrim is also inclined me to suggest that sound would be strong against dragon but I don't know how much sense this would make in the Pokemon universe I have a question for everyone if you could be a trial captain or a gym leader what would your type be and or what would your trial / Jim puzzle consist of thank you for all your hard work in making the podcast makes my days go by so much faster I love everyone on the show but will is definitely my favorite Gabriel I feel like we get to ask this gym leader question a lot but but this one is different because it's also asking us to make some sort of trial challenge yeah I just wanna props to Gabriel here for really thinking about sound type I think all the suggestions were really good I disagree philosophically with the second one because all of psychics weaknesses as they stand are common fears so right so the fear of ghosts like the fear of the supernatural the fear of insects that's why it's weak to bug dark is a little different but it's still uh it's still like you know the fear of it's like evil I don't think anybody's really afraid of well I guess you could be afraid of sound but it's not like a typically recognised fear so I I like that psychic has that sort of theme with all of its weaknesses but I like the sound I can one never made that connection before so that's really interesting one school sometimes sometimes that's pretty pretty sweet that's pretty neat but what if there was framed Pokemon artwork what if we got frame types the most expensive pokemon in the universe what if Conkeldurr used the materials that carry to build giant frames I mentioned before oh you're going later and I think if I were a trial captain here's the thing I actually kind of like the ice slide II puzzles sometimes if they're done well not bad um so maybe I would do one of those or maybe it would just be I don't know actually if it were to fit my personality would probably be a sillier one a lava like the fire trial in Sun and Moon where it's like you think it's gonna be like this intense spot the difference game and then it's a like just a nice silly joke mine would probably be a similar thing I'm not that I'm not like a puzzle II person it probably wouldn't fit my personality that well I would be a water gym leader I've said this before but my gym would be exactly like the Cerulean City Gym in the anime whereas except the water is all dr. pepper except like what I guess my my like complaint of the game is if you have an all water gym and just like cerulean city in the anime they really require - to pick Pokemon that could either one stand on a platform and battle up there or to just swim like why isn't that mechanic or rules set up more in in the anime like if I was at the Cerulean City Gym and I was battling a gym leader I couldn't use a Snorlax because Snorlax would make the platform sink and Snorlax would then drowned it would force you to change to use different Pokemon like gyms should have it so you would be forced in a way to change your team up more than just picking six Pokemon or just picking your starter and over leveling it and just burning through the actual game that would be my mechanic of like hey only certain Pokemon can work here all water pokemon could work here but only a certain Pokemon under a certain weight could stand on these platforms and actually battle hmm don'ts in the mechanic can I ask a question real quick this is a question I think about probably every single day in lieutenant surges gym with the garbage cans was there actually instructions and how to properly do that gym or were they solely relying on you to just keep guessing did they any point in the game prior to that like to tell you that you could look in garbage cans because I feel like once I walked in there when I played it the first time I was like oh I can look at the it's it's the garbage cans and I can look at him and I just feel like that was just like known I mean certainly items in garbage cans before that yeah right check but I man like everyday ever inform you in the game prior to that like hey you can look in garbage we some animals like I wouldn't yes yeah I like throwing away full potions it's either in Vilonia in my house is because there's throwing potions in the trash it's either yeah Travis Travis is right it's either in Viridian City or pute City where an npc says they threw away a potion and then you go over to the garbage can and you check and you get the potion that's that's not anything that maybe that like is the is what led to when you walk in there and it's a room full of garbage can so yeah yeah I don't think anyone got stuck on the whole point part of like checking garbage cans I'm asking though is is there a rhyme or like does any it ever state that like you need to find two switches to open the final door and how they would relate to each other or is it really just a guessing game because if you guess the first switch and then you guess another switch it resets and so then you go back to the first switch to find the second switch and usually with any type of puzzle there's like a there's like a reason for the puzzle or like a hint or like some instruction I don't think there was any instruction I'm fairly certain when you get the first switch it says you need to get one more and when you get the when you pick the wrong garbage can after that then it says something like oh no those switches reset I believe it's been a long time but I'm like ninety I don't have certain long it's a collection of the puzzle to like even contribute much hmm maybe a listener will know I'm just I just as a 10 year old playing that game I don't know how I got through that gym without just like without just trial and error but I yeah I feel like a Pokemon game is way more than trial and error I feel like there had been some instruction or some hints that I'd wasn't reading as a kid I feel like I mean I think it also may be over counting the ability of children to like just get something pretty quickly there are lots of things that I feel like I as an adult I would be like pretty mystified by but as a kid it was like no big deal I mean I'm not spending I'm not saying I spent hours on it as a kid I probably just activated every single garbage can until it opened and didn't really think anything more of that yeah I don't know as a kid how I got through these but I definitely did let's let's do one more question this is from Nick from Chora Nora can't California I don't know hey what's up Canada cornea Cora nach Corona Corona yeah probably Corona longtime listener current patreon backer SBJ you're the best Myka you're just as good now that that's out of the way sorry Travis oh that's alright I've been getting I I have not been getting a lot of favorites this week but I don't think there was a week of like a week or two ago when I was like three in a row so I'm yeah and I come up it's now maybe the first time anybody has mentioned me specifically in in mail no you get I know that we got that out of the way I have one question how should one start watching wrestling the topic is murmillo brought up on podcasters intrigued me and I saw in Houla there are some seasons of Raw and SmackDown but the problem is where do I start I don't need there's already too many people like peripherally involved in this I don't need the listeners of this show to also all watch wrestling because then then I'm just alone then it's like it's like now it's at least like theoretically there are some listeners who are in my boat who are like holy cow this wrestling thing is just sounds like a bunch of hot garbage at least I have camaraderie with a theoretical listener if all of the listeners all of a sudden start watching wrestling I'm just on my own and I can't handle that you could also just start watching wrestling no I'm a Contrave like everything I believe it's a really good time to be a wrestling fan if you're not watching American wrestling I want to give like a 30-second answer to this all right I don't even know where to start I would I mean lately what I've been telling people that have been that have said anything to me about like being interested in wrestling this is gonna sound really like I don't know it's it's gonna sound like really hip and I don't mean it to come off I know what you're gonna say and I disagree with you but go ahead I think the best thing for someone to do when they're interested in professional wrestling is to either watch one of two things to either watch a match that's ridiculous similar to like a young bucks match or make like maybe one of the like fashion Files matches where it's the Fashion Police like something ridiculous to get you in the mindset that like it's really self-aware these days or alternatively if you want something that's just really good athleticism to watch kenny omega versus okata which is like the highlight of professional wrestling right now see I yeah I disagree with you let's hear it I don't think somebody who does nothing about wrestling or where to start should watch one of the best matches of all times because I don't think they would understand the level of performance there it's like the way I think of an idiot the way I think of it is like this if I I watched like this is a weird analogy but to stay with me I watched Pulp Fiction when I was like 19 and I felt like if I would have watched it earlier like when I was like 14 or 13 I don't think I would appreciate it and I feel like wrestling is the same way of like there is so much going on that Minds tastes to enjoy a film about putting a watch up in one's nether regions I mean I watched I watched Pulp Fiction when I was like I don't know about that age like really early high school and I really enjoyed it you were probably way more mature than I was at that time well that's what I'm saying that about myself so what I would do this is what I would say this is my thirty second answer I would watch WrestleMania 33 which happened three months ago the most recent WrestleMania hmm there are only two bad matches on that card there's the Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton match that was bad but very interesting and then there was the Roman reigns an undertaker match that was kind of bad but that was mostly because the Undertaker being way too old otherwise I think that that pay-per-view gives you a good insight of what wrestling actually is and it's more of a performance and an actual show than it is about athleticism not discrediting that these people are extremely athletic and extremely talented they wrestle with the intent of not actually hurting the other person but in order to tell a story that's what I would do I would also say that WrestleMania xxx is a better WrestleMania but I think at that point it's so far removed from the current state of wrestling and I'm to a point now where I watch wrestling really pay-per-view buy pay-per-view yeah there is your your weekly Raw and your weekly Smackdown but I don't feel compelled to watch them regularly if I hear that there's something good or something interesting I will go seek that out but I think that every single pay-per-view that at least WWE does is really good at telling you why you should care about the match that's about to happen there's like a usually a two to three-minute like story of like why you should care about this and then the match actually happens that would that would be my suggestion yeah I mean I I think that at least I'm just going off of my personal experience like I found it way easier lately for people to watch a match and decide if they're into it way less likely that people will subscribe to like four hours of wrestling if they've never watched it I mean yeah but for that WrestleMania with a match I would recommend which was shane mcmahon vs AJ Styles did it really open with that yeah and that mat I mean it was a good match but it's again it's like that match was the best that's on the card oh I agree but of those of the stories for that night I think that was probably the weakest story so figure if it's like strictly from a story perspective like or you should be invested it's it's kind of weak it was and I was a good story it was it was a character who thought their general manager was screwing them over when in reality the general manager wasn't screwing them over but then they went too far and that what that's what led to the match yeah I mean I I'm still of the mind that like the the best introduction is something that shows you that it's not taking itself as seriously as everybody expects it to be taking itself so have you so if you were to do if you were to go to that route I think that's a good route I would do the Usos verse the fashion files at yeah what was the last pay-per-view called huh actly I'm the bank no it was that backlash it wasn't absolutely sure Oh money in the bank was new day versu soz i just want to add that quentin tarantino's an overrated director okay agreed Travis what's quite actually in his best movie his best movie is one that I'm not allowed to say on the show because it has a naughty word in it um but it's the one that has a naughty word in it not c1i yeah yeah I also really like Death Proof and I really like the kill bills but I think he's overrated generally I agree with you Travis give me the book amount of the week our Pokemon of the week our Pokemon of the week this week is Chauncey as Steve mentioned Chauncey was a bit of an interesting choice in the VGC tournaments going on right now so um Steve I'm gonna guess probably you'll talk about what you saw in the tournament because like I mentioned earlier in the show I was pretty busy this weekend so I haven't seen much but I can read out a set from our Pokemon of the week slack channel this one comes to us from slack user Gayle pretty much every Chauncey set is going to be using Evo light if it weren't it would have been a Blissey instead Evo late is an item that increases the defense and special defense of Pokemon that have the capability to evolve and so Chauncey is a perfect candidate because Chauncey is one of those Pokemon that has incredibly high HP so it already has a lot of bulk and when it evolves it mostly gains just a bit more bulk so Evo light tends to it ends up giving it more stats there's an argument to be had for maybe in some cases you would want Blissey with leftovers depending on the set especially in singles it's as I understand it it's more of a toss up actually I don't know now and gen7 that was the case in Gen 6 but so here's our double set for Chauncey with Evo light the ability is natural key or the EVs are 252 and HP 252 in defence and foreign special defense with a bold nature the moves are wish seismic toss toxic and protect so this is a set that it mainly attempts to stall out the end of the game so toxic is your main source of damage so put toxic poison on your opponents and then you alternate using wish and protect so that you are able to he recovering HP or and this is the reason you would want run wish as opposed to soft-boiled you can run wish and then swap out to another Pokemon that's damaged to have the wish land on that Pokemon you swap out wishes a move that increases your HP the turn after you use it so you can use wish and then swap out to a new Pokemon that new Pokemon gets the healing benefit of wish so that's why you would use it in some instances over soft-boiled which would heal you immediately because sometimes it's not chancy that you necessarily want to heal but near the end of the game your chance he's probably still alive because it's very tough to take down and then you hope that toxic is enough to just sort of Whittle the opponent's down as you stall out the game with wish and protect and then seismic toss is in there because chancy's offensive capabilities are very very limited so seismic toss is a move that deals damage equal to the pokemons level in this case that would be 50 damage because in VGC you play at level 50 so you at least get that much damage it's not a lot but sometimes you just need to do a tiny bit of damage to knock a Pokemon out as I understand it though the set that you saw in VGC was was a more healer oriented one with like heal pulse and the ability is the ability just called healer oh yes it is yeah so the the set that made top 10 and I believe they won their round so they moved on to I don't know how the bracket works I know I don't think it's a bracket I think it's by point system anyways they won their match with chancy the moves were soft-boiled seismic tossed heal pulse toxic nature was bold item was evil light ability healer so Michael was actually over when we saw we were we watched about two hours of the video game competent well we watched like a half hour video game competition because they they sat on commentators for an hour and a half but this chance he really stood out to me just because because I think it's it's very easy to look at a move set on paper and go okay I'm gonna do that but it's totally different seeing that in action so no discredit to Gabe's set that you read earlier when I looked at this set and I didn't see protect and Gabe recommended protect and I think protected this great move I'm not gonna discredit that I see why the the person who made top ten didn't run protect because you don't need it there was nothing that could that could one-hit ko Chauncey so instead of protecting just soft boil yourself and you're back to normal all the Pokemon I read off earlier not us there's there was like not a single fighting Pokemon in that mix there's just no active fighting pokémon that could actually one-hit ko chancy and I'm not saying that be mentioned Hariyama though right so there was I don't know it there was one Hariyama yeah you're correct there yeah so there was one fighting Pokemon out of you know the hundreds of our canines and top right goes that existed there was no move that I saw during all the games I saw this chance to compete and that even could get chancy down to half I think the only thing that could have came close was a Gyarados that was powering itself up over and over because chancy toxin did toxic it was almost it was pretty much a waste for that Gyarados to power itself up because it was wasting so much time powering it up and that time that I I totally forgot how much damage toxic does over time like it's so celebrating the first turn and then it just gets so wild as like it just dramatically increases there was with electric terrain out and with tapu coco doing it z move which is gigavolt havoc it it did like 25% damage to Chauncey and chance you just he'll pull a soft-boiled the next turn and it was back to full health it was just unbelievable was there a specific Pokemon that Chauncey was out there to use heal pulse on like there was there like a setup Pokemon that it was aiming to try to keep alive Chauncey never did heal pulse interesting that I saw it also never used seismic toss it would just continue to toxic every uh new Pokemon on the field so there was at one point all four of the opponent's Pokemon were poisoned if they weren't already knocked out and then it just continued to soft-boiled and it it never went below yellow health it just was incredible how considerate yeah like broken in competitive then because of that how it sounds to know I wouldn't consider it broken because if you had one fighting-type pokémon and uses dynamic punch there's no way Chauncey to survived it or just use taunt okay it's done like goodbye cuz then I can use the seismic toss and and that ain't great also my weights like that it's just a it just is it seems like a it seems like the person who ran it did a good job in reading the format and reading as you mentioned Steve hmm seems like there's not a lot of very strong fighting moves in them in the meta right now and also I don't know that a lot of people are running taunt this year cuz I don't I didn't see a single Tom from any of the movies I looked at I just know matter is leading the meta and realizing there's not a lot that people are running that happens to be able to counter it so that's just a good like not a choice I know the commentators said that if Gyarados could have gotten to I don't know what move it was using it wasn't Swords Dance but it was just a move to buff up your Gyarados dragon dance likely yeah dragon dance I know the commentator said if you're if Gyarados could get to dragon dances off and then do its move it would probably be enough to take out chancy and I believe them because they were they were pretty spot-on with with most of their calls but by the time Gyarados got its second dragon dance-off it was below half HP because of the toxic yeah and then its other Pokemon just used a move and finished Gyarados off and the person they were facing kept focusing on the Chansey which I'm not saying I'm good at competitive but after you realize that gigavolt havoc with electric terrain doesn't even come close to doing 30% damage to chancy I would have just continued focusing on the other Pokemon that were coming in and out and just leave chancy blast I don't know if that was a viable strategy but I guess that's what I would have done in retrospect because even both their Pokemon attacking Chauncey couldn't really they didn't have the right type matchup against Chauncey but there you go in Pokemon Red and Blue beta Chauncey was originally known as lucky Chauncey shares the same category with execute they are both known as the egg Pokemon Chauncey has the highest HP of all Pokemon that can involve excluding Arceus and so valley Chauncey and its evolutionary family has the most in-game items associated with them for example lucky punch lucky egg luck incense and oval stone Chauncey ties with the with Happiny for having the lowest base stat attack and defense of all Pokemon both at five and a shiny Chauncey is kind of this ugly egg color with green highlights it's really the color of an egg instead of being pink ah so yeah there you go and chances 100% female for breeding purposes I suppose in case you didn't know well that wraps up our episode for you guys let's move on to some housecleaning I recorded a bunch of Pokemon Center reviews with the old head cam this weekend ten reviews specifically
