said I have Micah here hello speaking of arguing with mothers uh I love my mother and that's all I'm gonna say have you argued with your mother yet today no I actually sent her a very kind message right away at 5:00 a.m. and I'm assuming she was sleeping I was sleeping did I just say off sleeping yeah that's a word it's okay I'm assuming she was sleeping and she woke up when she heard it and responded it sounded a little delirious I believe I texted my mother at the same moment that she texted yours yeah and we clogged up the internet with happy Mother's Day text Skindred mother Mother's Day Souls well if you if you are a mother listening to this happy Mother's Day this obviously comes out of Monday the day after Mother's Day so your day is over hey shout out to all the moms if you if

that is and yes isn't it I don't need TV or is it a TV show is a movie I don't need I don't need that to spark my creative podcasting more words and then we have an interview with Joe from Sarah be a very tiny fan-made site they don't get a lot of traffic not not a lot of people have heard of Sarah B so we really want to we really want to you know give them the push you what site is this and boost their their clicks yeah booth they give him some attention no Joe Joe runs Y easily one of the most III think it's its neck and neck between bubble PD and Sarah be of the the top two Pokemon sites out there so we've had him on the show before he's he's a great guy so we'll have an interview with Joe his thoughts with future Pokemon games as current thoughts on Sun and Moon and you know just your general Pokemon related questions after that we will do a couple emails and then we will do our pokemon of the week so that is the show for you guys today I have been using therapy for an extremely long time and I use it almost exclusively because I've been using it so long I have it loaded on my computer right now but only because they he listed out where the zygarde cells are in such a nice format it's really easy tomorrow oh yeah that's still a thing to do in Sun and Moon I've been playing Pokemon pretty much this entire weekend none I forgot about I forgot about zygarde cells too I forget that Southern Isles a game oh I have nine zygarde cells left to find and boy oh boy thank goodness for Netflix what have you off topic real quick what are you watching on Netflix well I just finished watching the program that should not be spoken of boo shibushi Road no one the blue ocean the one about the teenagers it's so controversial but I also watched dear white people which was a really great series I recommend everybody watch that that pops up every time I turn on Netflix and I I'm looking forward to watching it but City so far I'm just coming to Netflix to rewatch Twin Peaks hmm Vaughn Twin Peaks I mean is net fleet is on Twin Peaks they got they can service up there Twin Peaks is definitely on Netflix and if you haven't watched Twin Peaks you should watch it because it's very strange and it's very good at its iconic and now yeah is the only person in this conversation he used to watch it you know on Wednesday nights every week when is it now isn't it like their exception I'm not interested in that the third season is starting next Sunday I feel like 25 years later I feel like I can't live up to the hype I feel like you can and I feel like Travis were here we would be sharing this excitement together well they're not leaves so Travis also you have to understand Steve Twin Peaks is not like the x-files Twin Peaks is like Days of Our Lives except with it's worse that it's it's incredible that because they arrabal played they played everybody to think that it was a soap opera and then they turned it into sci-fi and sanity and I'm out of it I'm not interested in this yeah I guarantee you would hate it Oh Steve definitely would but Steve's mostly wrong about most everything how could it be wrong about hating something I either later Mother's Day here's the thing I don't watch a lot of TV everything I do watch on TV is so watered down and pointless to watch anyways that it is just background noise for me is this your way of segwaying into Eurovision yeah that well that was disappointing ha ha ha how did you even watch that I don't know how people watch that AHS entry there's a there's a reddit there's a subreddit for your vision and then it had like links for people and it's like if you're America click here if you're Lithuania click here if you're Australia click here somebody did the work I just click the link anyways anyway let's get to spokeman news first bit of news here is Pidgeot I steal excites heracross site the I hate these words houndoom Hittite are now available in Sun and Moon with the universal code that universal code is Azul AZ ul these mega stones will allow Pidgeot steelix heracross and houndoom to mega evolve while the Pidgeot and steelix were previously available to participants of the canto vers illallah regional rumble Wi-Fi tournament this is the currently the only way to obtain heracross site and how new might in Pokemon Sun and Moon no end date for the code has been announced so isn't well first off I was going to text you when I saw that came out and then I realized I probably get a mean reply because you probably already knew that Pidgeot it--was was out oh I need to tell you I'm on ty yeah I'm on top of the Pokemon news yeah wasn't azul like the bad guy from ghostbusters 2 azul means blue and spanish I thought Azul was that mean that'd be also at the swimming game it's also a location in Brazil hmm it's also probably a Crayola crayon probably so you're telling me it wasn't the bad guy from ghostbusters 2 you know it could have been I mean it just sounds like something that the 80s would have thought was a bad thing nope you know what's move that a get that a out of there it's Zul mmm ah it's to use Z will o zu as you ill so once again Pokemon trying to trick our children into worshipping demon I don't know I don't know what why is it a zoo oh why is it not like psh H yes me like am I missing something so like a hidden reference here Maggie's Pokemon her blue belly yeah that was my gosh water pokemon what's the significance of the word maybe it's a clue to Pokemon stars maybe Pokemon stars only Zuul if it's just an all water continent it's just water world that's it speaking of likes it does that an 80s movie why is everything 10 now enough water movie but they're like they heard Will Anderson say too much water one too many times will give them too much water all water only water man your shoes are jet skis next bit of news here is the Pokemon company international names wicked cool toys as master toys license II so the company is called wicked cool toys as the master toys licensee for the Pokemon brand starting July 2018 in addition to the announcement the Pokemon company has announced it has become a strategic investor but what does that mean this buzz words in wicked cool toys and will have a seat on the and the toy company's board of directors the full announcement details can be found in this press release can use that name one more time wicked cool toys it's great yeah I'm not familiar with that brand but I think strategic investor means that they have bought a sufficient portion of voting shares that they have a controlling interest in the company without having an ownership interest in the company right so ownership is when you have like over 50% of the shares and then basically you can make any decision you want because nobody can vote more than you but a controlling interest might be like you have 30% of the shares and somebody else has 30% of the shares so you guys have to like agree on things but you can't necessarily just make those decisions on your own that makes enormous strategic I feel like you could drop the word strategic though and just be investor that's curious to me though what they what they'll be doing what their plan is with that a little bit more of the press release just because this is kind of interesting I don't know if it states what what toys wicked-cool has actually made I actually just pulled it up and I can eat to you some of the brand's all Ruxpin is one of them hold on oh wait are you all out of those brands I got really excited I apologize continue we got a quote here quote toys are a major part of pokemons mission to bring fun and joy of the brand to kids and fans around the world we're excited to welcome Wicky cool toys the Pokemon family as its master toys licensee said Colin Palmer vice president of marketing and license at the Pokemon company international quote wicked cool toys is a growing company and we are thrilled to build a strategic partnership with them through both collaboration and financial investment end quote and then it went on to say Tommy T oh my will continue to be a key licensing partner for the Pokemon brand and will produce select items as well as products inspired by the Pokemon video game such as the popular Pokemon Z ring which interacts with the mega hit the mega hit Pokemon Sun and Moon currently available for the Nintendo 3ds family interesting it sounds like Tommy's getting the door though ah I mean it sounds like it's reminiscent of like hey uh we're pulling in this other person and you guys both do a good job together and whichever one of you doesn't you're out you're out good man oh wow I would bet that Pokemon has no strategic investment in Tommy probably not did now ty did the bee made it be bina Bobby baby blues but ah the old baby blues is a country we call those the baby azules yeah the old bina boobies that was high okay it wasn't tell me I had the wrong company so it could also be that it's just that wicked cool toys does different things then Tomy does or Tommy I've always said Tomy I don't know how'd you get at me - can we get a voice actor on here to confirm we get a Pokemon voice actor to confer uh whatwhat's the list give me the list of toys alright so they did Teddy Ruxpin which I don't know if you're familiar with Teddy wrote what yeah yeah I was I was born in the nine the eighties alright alright alright they did uh they do Cabbage Patch Kids which is which I think it fests that's a license that they purchased I don't think that they originally made the Cabbage Patch Kids because I don't know make him out about if there was a company named wicked cool in the 80s they would not have been able to sell anything because somebody would have found that very evil well maybe in your company name wicked cool toys sounds like somebody like a kid from the 80s made it up hey we got extreme cycle which I've never heard of but they have a whole line of MasterChef junior cooking gear they make a bunch of WWE like rings and like accessories stuff they do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles they do my girls dollhouse which I'm not familiar with but maybe is a big thing that's I there's others but I can guarantee we've never heard of them because they look like somebody made them up you don't know my toy now on the fly all right you know the wild kratts yeah yeah I'm down with the crap okay well I just want to date the crap brothers so bad look of the original cat paw yeah yeah friendly yet feisty that's a real thing that I'm reading yeah that was actually my nickname in high school friendly friendly but feisty what about extreme cycle that's that's cool it's the exes is like paint so you know it's extreme clearly that 2017 Tech Dex yes there's also the there is they have a Girl Scout cookies product where they it's like ovens and then you buy ingredients to make the specific Girl Scout cookies in the ovens it's like Easy Bake but Girl Scout branded I guess all right I'm glad to there's also from which I am it's spelled VR um I'm assuming it's room but it reads as rum hmm well the use got an M lot over it yeah oh you're right it does because the umlaut is the wheels of the the car that the little kid is driving and actually that's going to be next month's pokemon code so enter VR um anima not get your get your mute tonight you're fair take it-- excuse me yeah you know and better take mega evolves that's yeah that's right next bit of news here is the Pokemon north american international championships poke North America international championships are the fourth and final international championship event of the 2017 championship series season this event will also be the last opportunity to earn championship points in 2017 this event is one of the largest will take place at the Indiana Convention Center from June 30th to July 2nd it will feature high championship point payout any prize pool value of $200,000 $200,000 based on attendance anyone in good standing with play Pokemon can participate this event takes place in the Indiana Convention Center it's been there for a million years - the one year when they went to Ohio for some odd reason badges entry will entry to this event will require a badge for all attendees including competitors in the main event and spectators children under the age of five will be given a wristband free of charge to allow entry into the event space there will be side events throughout the weekend Friday through Sunday see the full schedule here follow Pokemon comm live all weekend long there will be three streams for the event a pokemon TCG stream a VGC stream and a mage main stage stream live streams will include final matches on Sunday all right let's get to the bread and butter of this of this press release here I do like bread and I do like butter you telling me registration for this event will take place entirely on line competitors registration will be open for all age divisions until player caps are met or until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday June 20th whichever comes first all entry fees are non-refundable badges can only be purchased online using a credit or debit card and can only be picked up on-site at the event cash or payment for badges will not be accepted you're probably saying Steve what do you mean cash payments I just I just want to go in and trade with with fellow Pokemon trainers I just want to watch some really stale video game competition because everyone will be using the same all for beasts I just want to have a go it's not stale it's just dull but it's the bread and butter so yeah yeah I I've been told the VGC game is good this year but I have not in that I've not watched many competitive players play but why that why there is such this this description of credit cards and money exchanging hands is because if you are competing in the master division so these are for like you 15 years old and up 16 years old them up both the pokemon TCG and VGC Master Division players have to pay $60 in order to play if you're younger than that if you're in the junior and/or senior division for both the TCG and VGC you are paying $45 all competitors who register will receive a badge lanyard player pain deck box set of sleeves and either a play mat or a hat for 4 TCG players or a hat for VGC competitors this was never done in the past for my understanding and will you can correct me if I'm wrong but when I went to both VDC a and TCG competitions you don't get anything when I was when I wrecked when I incorrect when I first started going and you can correct me in a second it was free to play you just went in you played and then while you were playing they would hand out free prizes so just by playing it would be like Oh seat number 34 you get a play mat and it's like oh look I was sitting in seat 35 that sucks but okay cool that person just got a play mat then when they changed it to like $10 to play you still didn't get anything or at least I didn't and they still did the giveaway thing of like hey if table two seat one you get a free hat but maybe that was just the the how they coordinated those prizes slash gifts because clearly tcpi was sending them stuff to to do two giveaways slash do stuff with I mean yeah at local stuff but I was thinking about the old US Nationals we had a shirt you got a free t-shirt dude those things are sweet man you guys got t-shirts yeah the dot very well I got mediums instead of arches oops that was a thing with teetering is yeah they're cool but you almost never get your size because they only made 20 small for medium and then 702 XL well know your market but I mean I could have asked for a large I just didn't there's a reminder of the citizens of the suburb Skinner goes all right all we got is extra small and extra large well we're out of extra small well no and we used to get the promo cards too yeah yeah I'm sure they're still doing promo cards that that is that's not discussed here like I feel like that's a given but you're getting a deck box which is great a set of sleeves which is great a play mat play mats are on what pokemon center comm they're like $35 yes sir and if you got like a Worlds play mat remember when so every worlds they would have a store at Worlds and it would be like an eight-hour line to get you would have to wait at like 2 a.m. to wait for it to open at 9:00 a.m. and then when you get in everything sold out anyways but they would help play mats for like $40 at Worlds and then they would appear on eBay moments later for like $300 this is not a lie so you would either wait 8 hours and still not get a play mat at Worlds or if you were like top 16 maybe top 32 you would get a play mat just for competing now it seems like everyone's getting a play mat for your $60 which i think is if you're competing at that high of a level $60 I feel like is nothing but you're also getting stuff too so even if you lose all your matches you're still walking away with what would Pokemon Center sell a $35 play mat they would sell you a deck box probably for $5.99 and they would sell you a set of card sleeves for you know $9.99 let me finish this real quick competitors will be will be required to provide their name player ID some form of ID to pick up the badge juniors and seniors must also have a guard in present to pick up their badge all registered competitors under the age of 18 will also receive a spectator badge and a lanyard at no additional charge for a parent and guardian only one so since it's Mother's Day just take your mom and leave your dad out in the cold the spectator badge will not include any other items there is a registration fee for spectators as well if you are over the age of 16 you must pay $15 to even attend Nationals if you are under the age if you're 15 and under you must pay $10 spectator registration will also be online and is limited spectator registration will be open until badges sellout until that time they will continue to be available for online purchase throughout the entire weekend spectators over the age of 16 will receive three Pokemon TCG booster packs when they pick up their badge spectators aged 15 and under will receive two booster packs getrekt a registration confirmation email sent and it will require for pickup for the badges a maximum of six badges can be purchased at one time children under the age of five do not need to register they will be given six booster packs upon entry now I'm just kidding they don't get any booster packs oh wow that escalated so fast and I mean booster packs cost like four dollars each so I mean that's what I was in three 3:79 I think at your local target there's maybe at your local target at your local Wisconsin Target they might be 399 now if you're a $10 spectator or whatever and you get to booster packs it's not I mean like my dollars suspected at that point yeah and my question is if I'm a spectator do I can i play in the side events yeah cuz those are a thing I'm pretty sure yes that's how it's always been I know but is it still because they're making all these changes I mean $60 to go and play at us I even though it's called the North American International video game championship it is US Nationals uh that's a lot of money I mean yeah you're getting some goodies but you are it used to be free folks you are and so we were talking about this before the show and I brought up dota because the dota I don't I don't watch dota I don't play dota so please forgive me I just know dota from consuming enough giantbomb content that it's a big thing so for the 2016 dota International a midweek ticket cost $75 will grant entrance to the first four days of the event the finals tickets will be $100 and will grant access to the last two days of the main event both ticket options can be purchased single or together like that is that that is just to go to the International that is for spectators right there well they well here's the thing like the teams that go to the International I'm pretty sure they get in for free just like if you get enough championship points for worlds you go to worms for free but I'm I'm sure the the tournaments leading up to the International cost money or something to participate in right you're not I'm sure they - but I I was saying earlier - that it's a little bit of a different situation I think yeah they're both competitive games and and they're both big franchises but dota 2 is like one of the largest competitive platforms in the world for competitive gaming dota 2 for 2017 it's prize pool is 8.5 million holy smokes get out there and play your video games kids alright so we're gonna start - dota 2 podcast um it's also I mean I guess to me the most significant difference is that the Pokemon the VGC stuff is geared more towards kids where dota isn't and I would think that it would be a little bit more like family-friendly as pricing goes I think like but 10 to 15 dollars to see an event is pretty family-friendly not to mention that you're also getting booster packs yeah that's okay I have they had to pay for to spectate previously I don't know enough about vino this is the this is the first year you're paying de spectate that seems odd to me I mean it just in general because it's it seems odd that they're charging to spectate but then it seems odd that they're offering booster packs for people who pay to spectate because it well okay so hang at that point I think I think I and will feel free to chime in but I feel like you're paying for responsibility at that point if I lived in Indiana and I had nothing to do and I had a slight interest in Pokemon let's go to this place where there's a bunch of Pokemon people and let's walk around an open convention center I I didn't pay anything so if I if I try to steal from this vendor or I try to steal somebody's backpack or I decide to trash the bathroom and I get kicked out that was my afternoon right I um yeah whereas oh this event cost $10 now rather just stay at home and watch dota 2 on Twitch so I mean I mean there have been problems of people stealing things at Pokemon US Nationals I mean I had a friend of mine who like their backpack got stolen and they had won a couple of boxes and the boxes got stolen and I'm sure like yeah and pokemon cards are not cheap like Mewtwo e^x at one point was $80 and you needed four in a deck I find it hard to believe though that's ten dollars is gonna stop somebody from showing up in stealing stuff it now it provides enough crowd control it really does just putting that little bit of financial in what do you want to MSA not incentive but weird I mean it just stops the off the street people it also probably pays for more security guards you're getting your money back in boosters which i think is so if you don't play the TCG you're still it one it's free advertising two hopefully maybe make you play the TCG also it doesn't cost Pokemon any money to print paper cards right oh yeah though their profit on TCG cards like they're spending fifty cents to print a pack of cards including the foil wrapper and everything and making three dollars and fifty cents off of it so while uh here is my point so while you're paying fifteen dollars and you're getting three packs which no more or less comes to fifteen dollars you go oh it doesn't seem like pokemons making any money but obviously their profit profit margins are incredible on that stuff and that probably helps pay for more security guards I could see that you prevent you know bathrooms getting crashed it just seems odd to me to go from not charging spectators for years and then suddenly charging spectators and then saying I don't know here's free packs but like but maybe it's also just as simple as its it's a it's like like number collecting it forces people to register so they see how many people they're getting to come mmm that does help too but it has actually been a graduate hasn't gone from zero to sixty right right yeah they did that's my graduate solution asou you did thank you yeah there's the the prize pool has also gotten bigger every year which it just seems like they want people to take this more seriously and they can't do that at the point of just letting you know 800 people come in for free and watch and then walk out whereas those 800 people could probably all be fine with paying $10 and hey that lets us now stream that helps pay for streaming which then it gets more people to watch which then gets more people interested in playing it's the whole you gotta you gotta spend money to make money and they've been they've been spending money and now they need now they need money you're right that makes sense and and I think it also for a lot of the parents that are going and taking their kids they're getting boosters for their kids because they're probably not going to use them unless they play with them and there's a lot of ants that do that money is going to something that's also going to the kid and it's I mean it's not like the parents aren't going to pay ten or fifteen dollars if they're bringing their kid there so you're right yeah I I think I think it's fine like I can't think of any other you know eSport related things whether that's dota or Street Fighter or whatever fight whatever the fighting game invitational is called like that all cost money to Evo Evo yep I have to pick it back up to talk about the side event stuff real quick it looks like anyone can participate in that but that side of that side stuff does cost money if you want to participate in a battle royale that's ten dollars a person on demand pickups $5 j jr round-robin is free standard video game format $10 battle royale $10 VGC multi cup $10 per player $8 on demand pickups $5 if you want a TCG sealed tournament which i believe is when you get like four or five booster packs and you open them when you make a deck that's 20 dollars you get to keep those cards when you're done standard mastered TCG side tournament $10 so they have this throughout the entire weekend I don't know if you're getting something from the video game stuff like I I know what a battle royale is it's for people fighting and it's $10 I don't know get anything I'm sure there are prizes there's always been prizes for that stuff that 10 bucks may go to a prize pool for the winner yeah I think so cuz if you did like what was it well was it like a 24 man or like a 36 man like TCG tournament we we did it it was free at the time when we were at night yes but the winner got like a like a full box yep yeah the side defense were free and they had real prizes so yeah I don't know maybe they just found out that they were losing a lot of money from doing too many free prize or or maybe they found out that that these side events weren't doing well because they were free and no one wanted to waste time on free stuff where people wanted to pay $5.00 and hopefully like $5 for a chance to win a $120 box like those are good odds yeah but also we haven't gone in years and maybe like when X&Y came out Pokemon just became so much more popular that that many more people were coming like when we went and it was free it was it was a manageable size de vent but I haven't seen it right so it just may have become this huge event that they need to have a little more control over it could also be as simple as they determined that they could put a price tag on whatever and people are gonna pay it you can't put a price tag on my heart Micah we'll see if you volunteer like run events or whatnot because they do have a lot of volunteers they pay you in TCG cards correct get that and I'll tell you something sweet teeth I guess I have recently been looking into selling off my old TCG cards that might like old full arts and stuff that I've held on to and boy oh boy have those retained their value those things are still worth money yep yeah are those for like volunteering no no these are just like we're from when I used to play well to volunteer I don't know the Segway I thought maybe it was from volunteering if you want Willie Anderson you're gonna pay and you're gonna pay cash money not Pokemon Trading Cards I don't know if you got if you got $100 box of TCG cards you can make $100 probably with two of those cards in that box that depends on your polls right get a secret rare rayquaza something like that yeah but it's a full bar friend it's not like open packs were like somebody individually weighed them prior to giving him - you know you just mapped it and then sold the non ultra rare back yeah eBay oh man that's let's just let's spill all the tea on the the TCG problem so late last bit of news here is the magic harp song oh boy the magic harp song titled I love magic harp is a song made for or I love Culkin sand a site made in commemoration of a cross between Hiroshima Toyo carp and the Pokemon Center in Hiroshima music is credited to following Japanese name it was released on the official Japanese YouTube channel on July 28 2016 a dance version was uploaded February 23rd 2017 to promote the upcoming mobile game splash Magikarp the song later debuted in English on May 12th and was shown on the official English YouTube channel on the French German Italian Spanish YouTube channels the song was released with Japanese vocals and subtitles in their respective languages now we don't know much about splash Magikarp we just know that it's an upcoming spin-off game for iOS and Android scheduled to be released Japan the spring no word on any other date there that's why we haven't really talked about it have all hey I mean I've seen the Magikarp song a hundred times now will and Myka have you seen slash listened to set song I watched at your house and then I watched it twice since then I watched it once on my own and then I saw you saying very ignorant things about it on the internet and I decided not to watch it again well I have said nothing but good things about this ah incorrect you went on our giving where somebody said oh I like the Japanese vocals better and then you said oh no I hate the Japanese version because I don't understand what they're saying and I need it to be in English and I don't want to hear the Japanese classically and understand the words I don't like the song classic will always being wrong first uh I didn't say I hated the Japanese version I said I don't understand why people that speak English like Japanese versions better because you can't understand the words and my point was the words are what make the song good it's not like the music or the animation is selling you on the song oh it certainly is yeah it is more or less lovely music the why the why the magikarp song is so incredible is because of how Shady it is to magic art it is not it is so shady very loving of magikarp I'm gonna give a tattoo on my bicep of magic harp that says number one the weakest because I love magic harp so much now yeah thank you Pokemon company it's on my body forever while some people might think the song you know sounds better in Japanese because for whatever reason they think the lyrics are more magical to their ears in a different language we just have this conversation you don't get the the shady they like that shadiness doesn't come through like if you if you if you think it sounds better fine like I'm not going to say you're right or wrong but you're still not getting the the underlying message of how poorly they treat Magikarp at the beginning of the song and then how like it turns into like this is a love song yeah so see that's your misinterpretation of the word shade if you're throwing shade there's never any love behind it so that's the twist so it's not Shady it's a loving snow it's super shady and then the twist comes in the last two verses because the third verse says the pity Pokemon that's you although they think you're worthless you've won my heart that's when the twist begins because she stops putting him down at that point I didn't get I didn't look at it that deeply I got the message that I got all the way throughout was Magikarp is garbage but I still love it cuz it's cute and it's it it's like it's like when you love something because it's ugly like it's ugly but it's cute because it's ugly you know I agree I agree that's like the whole tone of the entire song like start to finish I don't know where all these twists and turns are coming from where all this these dramatics oh I but I will say this we had a conversation while we were watching New Japan Pro Wrestling about how there is there's a specific group of New Japan fans that don't speak Japanese but prefer the Japanese commentary and I think it's the same situation here where we don't really understand why because you can't tell what anyone's saying if you don't understand the language is this like ASMR at that point i okay I I can't I don't know how like deeply to get into this debate but you know I listen to a lot of Vocaloid I listen to a lot of j-pop I listen to a lot of kpop I do not speak Japanese I do not speak Korean I just like the way the music sounds I can agree with it up I don't need to understand the lyrics but maybe people just enjoy the excitement of the New Japan Pro Wrestling a Buescher Road product like the excitement of the announcers I just watch it do they get excited oh they get very excited yeah yeah they get excited here's the difference for me though I agree with you I also like some Vocaloid music and I like some j-pop and I like some kpop and so on what's your favorite Vocaloid album however they're actually I do a lot of hip-hop and there's a big boy track that came out recently from Outkast and he has Vocaloid on the hook for that song which is amazing but here's my point regardless of whether or not you can understand it or not if you enjoy it you enjoy it that's fine but if you are specifically picking the if there if there is an alternative where you can understand it and you're specifically picking the one that you can't understand why is that happening because I want to learn Japanese through osmosis I don't know that that's guy I assume they're picking the one they can't understand because they think that it sounds better and to them they don't care about the words because like there are definitely people who listen to music and they prefer the the beat and the music to the lyrics which I always thought was like that's just my not not my thing like I feel like to me what makes a song good is both music and lyrics I mean I guess it's the same argument as why people are in our argument but the same reason as why people will put on uh like Japanese voiceover and like JRPGs and stuff like that but the difference there is that you have subtitles so that you're understanding the game as you're playing it yeah I mean like I'm sure there was subtitles for the the Japanese version so it was like the Japanese magic harp you know singing it song and then there was subtitles underneath okay well let's change it I'm sure that you still get the message but I think I personally think the the girl singing has a great voice and it fits the song really well and I like the lyrics to me make the song I can I assumed it was a way singing what maybe it is I don't know who knows I certainly see wanting to seek out and listen to things like that like the Japanese version of something if it's the like original version of it because you want to experience the original version or the you know the source material and then experience the cover you know whatever the translation but if you had if if they're there and they're side-by-side and I can't understand one but I can't understand the other I'm probably gonna listen to the one I can understand otherwise I won't understand it this is basically the dub verse sub conversation isn't it pretty much yeah but the difference is that you get you get subtitles with a with a sub so you can still understand it look I've watched like Pan's Labyrinth which that entire movie is in Spanish and so of course me not know it look I can't even speak English more or less another language so you have to subtitle that entire movie and watching that movie is fantastic but if they were to be if they were just like remake that movie in English I would probably just watch the but I actually probably wouldn't watch it again I'm like a one-and-done kind of movie but okay so a good example is like Digimon cuz I've been watching a lot of Digimon and I've seen Adventure one and Adventure 2 probably three or four times at this point all the way through and so when I'm watching Digimon now I have it in the background so I'm mostly listening and I could never imagine watching that subbed because that would require me to look at the screen the entire time to like read it I feel the same way I mean it and watch a watch subbed anime if it's something if it's something that I'm really into I will sometimes watch the sub over the dub depending like I watched the entirety of Naruto with subs because I found the American voice actors for Naruto to be so excruciating but that's just personal preference at that point like I'm still understanding what I'm watching because I'm reading it on the screen you know and and for those that haven't seen the lyrics Japanese lyrics have been translated right to English but the English that we got on May 12th does not match the direct English from the original translation so for example just the the the first verse if you were to translate just the original Japanese it says unreliable and pathetic it's infamously feeble what we got was totally pathetic unreliable known throughout the world for being super weak and then the second verse directly translated was was it very strong long ago there was a rumor about but now it's very weak so tragic what we got is maybe in ancient times it was really strong but that's what the rumors say but they're probably wrong but now it's so weak the weakest in the land so weak it's sad really really sad so you can see that it's dramatically different than the what the Japanese English translates to so what was it dramatically different yeah I don't see it it was I didn't work as a translator in the Brazilian Embassy and even from Brazilian Emmy from Portuguese into English it's it's never easy dude did you ever talk to anybody from Azul what I'm saying now what I'm saying is they could have just put was it there it was it very strong long ago but now there's a rumor about that but now it's very weak so weak it's tragic they could have just put that up they could have just translated like that but instead they rewrote the song that didn't meet the tambour of the of the music I'm sure that's part of it to you right I don't like match the look I'm not gonna read the entire four minutes on we do it really different then as those translations are met all I'm saying is that speaks to the fact that they put work into this they could have just straight-up translated it but instead they they rewrote the song and then they cast somebody to sing it and I think it's fantastic I think it's all great and I hope that we see more of this stuff because I love it who would have thought they would have made a four-minute song about magic oh what a time to be alive what a time to be alive all right so what we'll do here is we'll take a quick break and then when we come back we got our interview with Joe from Sarah B so we will be right back I don't hate how that sub is good areum's like boring and bad selves get I'm interesting Zelda's gift there's probably a horse at some point and we are back from our break I'm here with with Joe who runs Sarah be Donna is it Sarah be calm or serviette have you updates don't NAT dotnet still don't that you don't do you have the right into questions do you not have the dock half I'd know some advertising company has it and I'm sure they're wanting like they're sitting on it for a couple thousand dollars probably probably something that but I'm fine no sorry we don't know it sounds cool isn't Sarah be calm so Joe welcome back the last time you were on was I think episode 150 so we're 265 so like three years ago now crazy long time yeah you run this you run this very tiny Pokemon website not a lot of people know about it but the for our listeners though maybe maybe two of them have not been to your website I don't know uh thinner that's a big place who are you and what do you do okay well I am Joe Merrick and I run Wow owned and run Sarah beat net which is the biggest Pokemon fan site arguably on the internet I think I can agree with that right like it's like you and bobble pedia or like one and two and sometimes you guys flips out every now and then yeah we like Neptune and Pluto in our orbits once I flip once a head the next time the others ahead I and so I think a quite at probably probably some questions we've asked before but you know things change uh I think a lot of a lot of people want to know is Sarah be your full-time job is how what you do for a living I consider it a full-time hobby mean I do do some freelance stuff on the sides but yeah you could say it's full-time and I do do it all hours right I'm a Annette I would assume that when Sun and Moon came out it was more than full time but probably we have probably now a 2007 it's a little more chill yeah it's for quiet time speaking of Sun and Moon what this is such a load to question what are your thoughts like from both you know the workload effective of you putting everything on the site and just the a personal and fan perspective of you being a pokemon trainer again oh well workload was crazy it always is with the main series game I'm constantly playing it I'm constantly updating and making sure everything's up there and as accurate as possible as fast ball and as I am just one person that so that is a lot of work so I could go sleep I didn't go out for a couple of weeks I just was working on it non-stop but it's still fun today I wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't fun yeah yeah is there when do you when you're playing it and I do what I do want to know your thoughts on how you enjoyed the game and everything but when you're playing it when do you decide do you have like a system in place or do you like come across something and then go okay I need to stop now and upload the site or does the excitement of playing go like okay maybe I'll update the set in like five more minutes I kind of want to see where this is going I might typically just it's what women main series game comes out I do a discovery thread on the forums and so everything is per ton there and on the main site a spoiler tag typically so basically everything that is personal basically anything relevant to you anything will go up on the discovery Fred and major stuff will go up in the spoiler tag and then once I'm done with the playthrough then that's when I start making pages okay so you do have somewhat of a system yeah what were your thoughts though on the gamers as just as just a fan and not and not somebody working you know 700 hours a week to update the site uh well I really enjoyed them it was a nice fresh take on Pokemon I mean it was nice to have the story as full-on as it was even though but I would have liked a bit more freedom and it was good to have changes from how it always has been because having 20 years and going Jim - Jim - Jim - Jim it's a bit it can be wearing and so having the trials and the grand trials and everything it was it was a nice change not saying that's how I want the series to be constantly now but it was a nice change and it was it felt to me like a great celebration of 20 years of Pokemon yeah so I really enjoyed it so you know you have you have the trials the game so it ends with the Elite Four you have a bunch of old Pokemon and of course the mix of new Pokemon was there anything that kind of stood out that you did really like that you possibly wanted to see in a future game and then follow-up question were there any Pokemon that stood out where you were like heck yes this two cannon is the best um well I'm trying to think of stuff which didn't sit right with me I mean I don't anything where is man I guess a postgame would always be nice to have a bit more to the postgame just like the battle frontier or something like that just to Silla teas which you can just keep playing other than like the battle tree which is just a nature version of the battle tower yeah and Pokemon well I really liked all the new so many of a new pokemon I mean you've got to Sid UI that's basically the green arrow yeah hunger wrong with that wishy-washys a fantastic one Iraq who needs a fantastic one I mean I could just list for the entire pokedex and say well that's a fantastic one speaking of the postgame stuff I I asked this question on Twitter and I was going to put it in our new segment but I figured I'd save it for you just because I feel like you'd have more insight on this but I pretty much asked if people were still playing Pokemon Sun and Moon at all now I mean we've we're six months removed from when the game originally lost but fifty eight percent of people said they're not playing it at all anymore a 31 percent of people say they played at least once weekly and 11 percent of people are said they play it daily so dear what are your thoughts on that does that seem to line up with you know your history with the series of people dropping off six months after or do you think because of the lack of a postgame it's more of a drop-off I think it's Todd's Prima part of the course for every Pokemon game aim game free curve / out saying that based on their research a very very small percentage of people actually bother with the battle frontier when it's in their game and so the post games really for the more hardcore fair and a lot of the people who are still playing and more of the competitive kinds people who go to like BGC events and things like that so it sounds that sounds about right I mean a lot of people just played to the end they get all the Pokemon and then they're done yeah it just seems standard to me okay get it I'm assuming Sarah B has seen a minor decrease in traffic because of what the numbers we just talked about 58 percent of people not playing at all anymore uh yeah I was actually looking about yesterday I try not to look at stats too often because I get obsessed with numbers and think oh no that's down oh no that's up only that's down oh god oh god defender hanok but it's back down to around where it was when Pokemon go came out okay did you see do you get you know I'm sure you do but like did Sarah B get a huge increase when Pokemon girl came out or was that or did other decent increase I mean Pokemon go to sort of game where people won't hunt out stuff around the internet other than like trackers and things like that it's not really a game based on needing information so people don't necessarily go hunting for it because it's not like you can go oh I really need to hand out where where do I get that I know I'll go on to Sarah be like you could with gold and silver and X&Y right so it's not really back information focus there's always a small spike whenever there's an event and I tweet that out because that gets a lot of traction sure sure again this is more website question just me being curious but like so obviously made serious games bringing the most to Serbia and obviously you you index everything you have the Pokedex you have the moves and stuff but you report on everything whether that's you know anime news or spin-off games like splash Magikarp or even like you report on like not weekly but bi-weekly however often they update Pokemon shuffle so people come to the site - for that is there is there a point where you go like I don't know why I'm updating Pokemon shuffle like no one's reading this or or does you know everything you post do well at some extent in various interesting pretty much everything I do I mean the shuffle tweets and news that gets some traction and same with Pokemon duel I mean sometimes it does feel like on all I'm doing is posting about apps and that's a bit you know disheartening but I mean don't get me wrong but I get that's where gaming is right now but it's a bit sad yeah I mean I like the full full-on spin-off games and having games which just services with stuff coming every week or every two weeks I I get it and it's actually great for me because it means I've always got something to do but I really it's just a bit disheartening I I mean we haven't had a proper spin-off game since pokken in March really have we yeah cuz mystery dungeon was before that super um that was infamous remember 2015 yeah that's when I covered it so we have are you into these mobile games though we have Pokemon duel Pokemon shuffle I guess Pokemon Rumble world was kind of like a mobile game on 3ds do you play those do they grab your interest I mean I I know the answer I know you play them because you're a Pokemon fan but like do you stick with them I guess for the most part eyes I enjoy them Iong shuffles a fun game even though they're later levels have really become ridiculously bloated in terms of the hit points you have to take off of the Pokemon and it's like oh they're asking for more and more money all you need to spend so many hours grinding for it and runs a bit there but really I do enjoy the spin-off games I mean I don't really enjoy the mystery dungeon games that much I mean sorry to voting like it I mean I love the presentation to them I love this I love music I love the story I just cannot stand that gameplay but yeah I still play most of the games I mean do and shuff I play weekly I mean do I tried to play more often but like other games like mobile games it's too random based so it's like that skill but there's also not skill and that sucks so I enjoy them I still play them and I look forward to splash Magikarp because that seems like it could be really interesting yeah we're still talking about mobile games it seems like at least that you know following you on Twitter you you're a go player and it seems like you're still into that yes what are your thoughts on go overall um I was really really against at first before it came out I was like this is terrible idea I mean it's gonna be terrible but when it came out I was surprised it was really lots and lots of fun I enjoyed going out with my girlfriend and with my friends just hunting for Pokemon then they remove the tracker oh hell he did okay that made it a bit less fun and now they've put a tracker of sorts back with the Pope whenever post-op but it's still not as good as it was mm-hmm but I still enjoy it I still play it whenever I go out I have my Pokemon go Plus on I mean I'm more of a passive player than an active let's go Pokemon hunting player sure but when there's an event out then I go Pokemon hunting again okay yeah that's kind of like how I've been playing it there were rumors and I don't know if Yantic said this directly but that at one point Pokemon go would connect a Sun in moon is that something you've heard of is that something you're interested in and if they can connect how do you feel about transferring the pokémon you catch and go to a Pokemon bank or to you know a main series game alright well Masuda he did say that that was the goal originally and varrick the my friends who'd do data miner games they have showed me that there is stuff in the games text for sending pokemon or items or something from go to son of me there's a special flag saying this is from Pokemon go there's even you know how there's like four two gone for kalos native pokemon beds but clover for a lola native poke wanna make a gameboy for um reading below the Virtual Console ones yeah yeah there's also a another symbol which we believe is for Pokemon go it's kind of like a G and an O quorum remember exactly what it looks like but so I'm pretty sure something's gonna come from Pokemon go whoever it's like just say if you participate in a raid and you get mutant then you can send them you two to the main games whether it's something like that and it's really hard to tell because the mechanics of go and the mechanics of a main series games they're not really compatible and when you've got a spin-off game which connects to the main games typically it's been just give latane this Pokemon in the game send it over rather than having a Pokemon you've been training in the game and send it over so I'm not entirely sure how they're gonna do it if that's what we're gonna do and allow you to send the game Pokemon over but I know I'm not again the step it could be funny make it worth playing more yeah hunting for Pokemon we have great - there Ivy's yeah I feel like it's harder to get Pokemon Pokemon go than it would be in the main series game like as somebody who still doesn't have a Charizard and has only caught like six Charmander so I'm nowhere near getting a card Pokemon go makes Pokemon a little bit more rare even though like you can catch a million pidgeys yeah but you connected you could do that wow yeah I do wish Fred saw out there like distribution of Pokemon in the world like I know I'm not seen an unknown yet I doubt many people have seen an unknown yeah so they need to like spread it out a lot more like around here well I'm getting right now is neeti okay it's like hey I play it a lot more if there is a lot more variety now I can see why there's not variety cuz it's only up to Gen 2 once it's up to Gen 7 and I can imagine there's gonna be so much variety instead of just Pidgey everywhere we're gonna have Pidgey and Starly and fletchling yeah hickey Peck I mean that's slightly better speaking of like travelling getting out of your house Pokemon go or now Pokemon go I'm pretty sure I have my information right here you traveled to the 2016 World Championships if I'm not mistaken yeah I went on holiday last year to go to that a lot of fun you participated in in pokken yeah I participated in the last-chance qualifier for pokken and I got on stream for it and then I got completely destroyed history what wha who are you who are using as using Pikachu okay okay app and I'd come up from the losers bracket and I ended up facing against the person who was the one who put me in the loser's bracket well perfect like oh yeah I've got a good shot here yeah yeah I want to talk a little bit about you actually being at Worlds but whatever what was your thoughts on pokken I like like you said earlier this was one of the last spin-off games we got uh if it's a fun game it's really fun game I mean it might not be the most competitive fighting game around but I had a lot of fun with it I just want more of it so I want the characters which from the arcade one to be in Vee one or hopefully a switch version down the line yeah we've said on the show that we we feel like the Wii U one is is done at this point and those characters aren't coming over yeah chances are there's gonna be a switch version I mean nah there's nothing being said other than the producers of it saying that they've worked on the switch and it's like oh you [ __ ] him a switch have you before game the worlds you probably it was it was that your first time in America or have you been here before it was my first time out the UK oh wow okay so so what are your thoughts on that and then it would the world is always besides it being in Canada it's always been in the you the US so no Advan in Japan one nut and I'm not buzzing Hawaii for a few yes yeah so first time at worlds first time at us man so many questions but were what were your thoughts was it was the u.s. as TV may seem to be a little bit that I had a lot of fun I mean Wells was a lot of fun even though they had for how spectator is she which kind of dampened it for everyone you remember that Danny yeah Kier can you elaborate on that well I mean we I got like the pro I got I got I saw via Twitter and Facebook and you know hearing about that but you were there so what exactly happened with that well basically because of how the Pokemon circuit was last year they had so many people invited to Worlds and so many people turned up but they had to not allow spectators into the venue because there wasn't enough room which is very unfortunate for people who who booked is in advance thinking oh we can go to this because it's always been free and everyone's been allowed in and then that happened it was the best thing to happen but I managed get in because well you know house for [ __ ] and stuff yeah but I feel like even even if if like somebody traveled X amount I mean what was your flight like 1415 hours I was only 11 thankfully okay so still 11 hours to fly 11 hours spend all that money and then to get to the door and them GAD nah don't come like they did let a handful of spectators in yeah each day they let a few in and it's just the way they handled it which was a bit iffy because they only told people like two weeks before yeah and that's like not really fair to people like if they're going to do similar this year they need to let people know soon but since it's in the Anaheim Convention Center this year then it should be fine I hope but maybe they'll have registration fees for spectators like they are having for the International Championship so it might not be free yes we talked about that earlier how it was if you're over 16 it's $15 just to spectate you have to register online so at least it with that system they're getting a head count before people are even showing up yeah that's a good thing at least and you get booster packs for it in internationals hopefully they'd do the statement they do it for Wells is that could make it worth it yeah you could pull a card which is worth $80 and it's like oh sweet I'm on so besides you know the The Spectator issue besides you know getting knocked out at the Last Chance Qualifier how was worlds we have a lot of listeners and I'm sure you have a lot of people that come to the website your website that have never been to worlds or even maybe a Nationals or a regionals like what was your thoughts on Worlds and is is that like a destination that Pokemon fans should go to oh wow well C is really still a massive tournament so there's not that much to do if you're not competing in it and obviously you need to earn your position in it so I do wish with worlds but there was more to do for the spectators I mean you can enter inside events and whatnot right that's good that's good and I would have done that but I wanted to watch all the matches so it was a lot of fun I enjoyed it and met a load of cool people and I was jet-lagged I was so jet-lagged so on the Saturday I think it was a Saturday we were just sitting in watching matches and I I mean I'm not saying it was boring it wasn't boring but I was just falling asleep because I had still not acclimatized to the time change it's just because it was like 7 p.m. in San Francisco and that's what free a.m. in the UK time I was just dead to the world how n booked lures you're Sam for the San Francisco experience like was like American food to you just extremely fatty and unhealthy compared to European food for lunch on one day I got a sandwich from one of the places at the venue and it was the thickest sandwich I have ever seen in my life it has so much meat in it I thought I was just eating a giant pig that's like that's not how you do a sandwich it was just so bizarre but I ended up eating it all but still we're so bizarre sure that when I had a scoops here joenie sandwiches and I went to a American diner which was just down the street from your venue as well that was really nice so yeah I mean I enjoyed it is are you are you planning on going to 2017 worlds or or one was enough for now now I'm hoping to go I mean I've got a few obstacles to deal with first but I'm hoping that I will be there so if all goes well I will be there okay have you been doing any local or regional tournaments in your area when it comes to like Sun and Moon video Sun and Moon competition or anything else in that regards um I did go to the European international championships which were held in London in December I did compete in those but that kind of soured me on competitive for a little bit because it was held just two weeks after Sun and Moon came out I had already rushed through a game twice I needed to rush for it for a third time in order to get my for my for fun game because I always have courage game coverage game and a for fun game sure so I had to get my coverage I'm mindful fun game up to the final bits where I've got all the Zed crystals and everything just so I can probably compete and it just kind of got the fun out of it for me and it kind of soured me on this year of the video game Championships haven't really been following it as much which really sucks because I was really wanting to get into it however it changed the rule set it wasn't like nothing but legendaries like it was last year yeah I really wanted to get into it but because of how soon it was after the games it just really killed it for me but I'm starting to get back into competitive I'm actually part of them multi battle II with my girlfriends and basically we're battling a load of the prominent people in the community he'd like Google um's crafty Gameboy Luke Dunkin me deep wolfy Glick people like that a real part of it and that should bring my competitive love back I hope and you you know you're not a TCG player are you uh no not really but I've started collecting it more and more my girlfriend's a really big TCG player well she she's gotten into the TCG late be she was a VGC player she like top hate in the UK a few years back but she's moved to TCG and it's been getting me into it me I I wouldn't play it competitively because that would cost a lot of money yeah it's an expensive hobby even just collecting it here in bears like I've just spent a hundred and fifty credit what am i doing switch gears a little bit we had we had this conversation last week what I know you watched the anime yes I had some of the old anime on and I was always under the impression you can correct me if I'm wrong here that the anime is pretty accurate when it comes to Pokemon pronunciations ah we've had like we've had professor Sycamore on Jake cake I believe his name is we've had Corey from what was he from Hoenn we've had him on and both of them went on record saying that because I've asked right you have voice actors on you gotta ask like how do you say Pokemon names does like somebody standing there have like an ultimate list and they tell you you know like how are the pronunciations and both have gone on record saying like they're very particular and how you say the name when your voice acting so like okay so anyways so I had an episode on in the background and I have always known the beaver Pokemon to be Bidoof because it's B I do Oh F but the anime said B do and I was like oh I've never heard it's a Bidoof but I suppose it's Bidoof that's what the anime says and there's a not to you know bring up bubble PDF there's a article on Bubba pedia that has you know the phonetic way of saying Pokemon names and it also said Bidoof what what what is your stance on how Pokemon names are said oh well that's never really been that much of a like a reference point until 2013 when we got pokedex 3d Pro and that gave us a proper reference point for pronunciations and I'm not entirely I haven't heard it as beep do fix it yeah makers everyone says Bidoof but let me just double-check what what back game says but where is it there is yeah Bidoof huh don't know if you heard that I did I did I didn't think that I know there's a there's a there's like a handbook out there that you can like buy a Barnes & Noble that does have like the phonetic spelling in it says official handbook who knows what if it's official or not I guess my question though is if you're talking with somebody and they say Rayquaza or they say rayquaza or they say sighs or or they say scizor or Bidoof or Bidoof where's your stance look do you correct the person or do you just like hey it's a Pokemon II I know what you're saying like where where's your stance on that for my spot I'm like I know what you're saying but whenever someone doesn't pronounce one particular Pokemon correctly because nobody really does look just a specific Pokemon I always bring it up because it's hilarious because it's the most convoluted way of saying it it's the Pokemon illumi they can't even as most people make would pronounce it illumise yeah illumise or illumise but it's you me say that's just the most ridiculous one I have ever heard and I always bring it up whenever someone mispronounce edge to say actually that's called Illume easy for everything else I just let slide because even though there's strict on it now there have been so many pronunciations as specific of various Pokemon like Arceus has been Arceus yes officially as well and like there's Tropius and Tropius have both been used right yeah and I've heard the anime hasn't always been the most accurate but again I get again I'd have to ask some more voice actors like where are you getting your source material here there is another one which I am kind of set on and it's porygon Zed not porygon Z all right I did hear you earlier say Zed crystals yep I am very British this is what has to be done plus technically in Japan it's like zet or so debt so is that okay okay so yeah the British may be more British um you do all the Pokemon news shuffle anime main series Game pot hacking as somebody who runs arguably the biggest Pokemon site out there do you also keep tabs on other Pokemon fan sites youtubers podcasters you know twitch streamers are you watching all those two on top of the news or for the most part you just you know you just do what you do and kind of ignore the rest so the most part I do keep to myself I mean I try to stay away from other websites but has been drama in the past although I'm good friends with a lot of website owners now when let's do a couple who I'm not friends with and you can probably guess who they are but for the most part on good terms and I'm friends with a lot of the Pokemon youtubers I mean I tried to watch as much as I can but my times limited but and I tried to stay on top of it as much as possible in the fandom I mean I used to not really do that [ __ ] I used to just be me and I used to not pay attention to anything but recently over the last few years basically since we lost both I've been getting out there I've been going to events more I've been putting myself out there more I've been meeting people I've been getting to know a lot of the other prominent people in the community and I think it's a lot better that way because we're a community army yeah yeah and so I shut myself out I kind of segmented for community and I didn't like that nice like being friends with people and so so I keep trying to keep on top of everything but possible yeah I think the Pokemon community was so different you know five six years ago and I've tried to reach out to you know every Pokemon site whether that's set you or Bob pedia or pokey Beach or you know poke a jungle there's so many out there and for the most part everyone has been really nice there's still a couple sites that you know why would I want to be at a Pokemon podcast uh okay you know that's cool you don't have to just Wow what's I mean who would say that I would say only shame from name and shame them I will say that conversation might have been with pokey Beach I was like hey you want to be out and it was like why would I want to wow I don't know man to talk about Pokemon you do good work I'm not gonna like say your site's not great it's great for TCG stuff no I've only had a lot I've only had good conversations with people in the community that got a nice community yeah that conversation with pokey Beach was like was like four or five years ago so uh maybe I'll ask him again but everyone seems nice everyone seems great for like you the youtubers and like the twitch streamers and stuff like there are there a lot of big ones out there shiny streamers competitive streamers Wolfie Glee coz is obviously really big when it comes to the video game I've actually talked in and battled with him at Nationals before he was incredibly nice I've interviewed Aaron Zhang also a great competitive battler for what you do obviously as somebody who runs the biggest Pokemon website have you thought about doing YouTube or twitch or anything like that or do you just not have the time or you are you just not interested in being on camera and it's really more of a time thing I have done a few twitch streams whenever there's been a demo or for a Pokemon game like this Pokemon Sun and Moon demo back in October when it came out I did a stream for that and like other said daily I'm doing that multi battle league with other youtubers and prominent people when Matt's on YouTube but I don't really have the time to be like the other youtubers and do like massive Let's Plays and research loads of videos like theories and stuff like that I really don't have the time for that because the site takes up so much time I mean so many people think Oh Jerry he doesn't do much he just rolls out of bed and updates his side's and hates games it's like I do so much have to always be alert I have to always have my laptop with me just in case something drops when I'm out right so it's such hard work it takes a lot of time I mean I don't really remember last time actually had a day off now I know I know with no I don't think anyone that would debate that Serbia's is easily one of the first if not always the first when it comes to Pokemon news and that just speaks to the amount of work you do and how dedicated you are but and I don't I don't have any specific examples but let's say for example you know this site site XYZ is doing something better than you is that something you consider of like oh how they I don't know like lay out their Pokemon like looks better or hey how they address this shuffle information is better maybe I should adopt that maybe I should change that is it is there anything like that that seems to cross your mind of like I'm gonna take inspiration from this because they are doing it right and I want I want Sarah B to be the best it can be the only thing which is kind of like that is for mobile layout which I've been working on for the last two years I was so close to getting it right but CSS is just a horrible monster to work with anyone who's run a web site would know this yes it's just getting it so it looks great on a desktop and it looks great on mobile is always a tricky tricky thing because so many sites nowadays they go for a mobile layout and it looks like complete on desktop mm-hmm it looks really good on desktop but it's unusable on mobile yeah and so I'm trying to forget the right balance I think I've got it but there's just massive it issue good to stopping me from doing but once that's done then the site will load better on mobile and you won't have to swipe it swipe to zoom it which I know is a bit annoying for people yeah that's the only root thing I mean in the past I had been complacent with how I did things on the site and that's when Baba pedia started showing up ad side getting popular and that really caused me to just think okay I actually have to put more effort in really and that's when I started doing things like the pokeo section and the item database which I have and so many people say what amazing resources they are so I definitely did a good thing so it was good to get a nice kick up the butt right a little competition made Guerra be better yeah you know 100 100 some episodes ago we talked about a new snus Arabi and you said you were working at it you kind of mentioned that you know you're working on a mobile view but is there is there still a more updated modern Sarah be in the works and I don't I don't mean to throw rocks but some would argue that Sarah B looks like a website from 1989 oh come on it's because I'm from 2004 okay alright alright well basically the way I see it is website design is cyclical so in a year or two my layout will be cool again and people won't care there you go it's like when you're in it's like when you play pokemon red/blue as a there's a ten year old and then when you get to college it's good again yet but seriously both like design at the moment the standards for website design is not really applicable to websites with a lot of content because it's so hard to get navigation right when you've got a lot of content yes yes so sites would either just go with a search or they would just have like 12 pages and for a site besides therapy which has got like seven hundred thousand pages to have specific navigation and like the free column layout I know it's not ideal because you have to search things I mean there is a search on the site if you want to use it yeah I know it's pretty well I mean it's Google you can't go wrong with Google but having things on the left and then things on the right is the only really only way to really have so much content on the site and I try to make sure everything is findable within free clicks on another page and that is one of the ten poles of website design everything has to be findable with preferably without a search within free clicks mm hmm and that's why I've got on so a bead on net and the new layout currently looks exactly the same on desktop I'm not going to lie but I needed to get the functionality right before I started fiddling with looks right yeah you wouldn't want to like make it look good and then all of a sudden all your work and mobile has to be redone yeah and the plan is basically for it to look similar to where it does now bit of a big a fun bit more padding and that should make everything look fine although I did do some tests and bigger font makes it look cluttered so I have to kind of get the balance right and that's the hardest thing and whenever I start making headway on something they say and a new pokemon game is announced I'm like oh yeah where where goes back projects right I guess I'll see it in another six months yeah because Sarah B dotnet is pretty much just me I mean other sites they have huge team and I know Bubba pedia because it's so used to but edited thing like there's a huge team of staff and it has just fans editing this the Derby dotnet is pretty much me have my friends who data mine which really helps with pokedex and I've got translators and the Pokemon of a weak writer but everything else it's me when you go to a section like the Sun immune section I have written every single page which is on that myself okay that's why things might not be updated so fast that's why if there's an error it's probably not been caught and people need to email me this is a one-man show sure so we are we brought our pokey Beach earlier and again I'm sure he's a nice guy I do know that he hired some help and they they had a site kinda that was similar to you that kind of like 2004 look and then I know you hired some people and they updated their site and it looks the way it does now I think it looks slightly different than originally what he launched it but have you ever considered like hiring another coder a backing code or even maybe a front-end coder just to like help accelerate that project um a couple of times yeah but I'm very stubborn I'm an old man set in my ways I'm like if I can't do it no one will do it sure sometimes that you kind of just want it off your plate yeah I mean I have spoken to a few people about trying to work out the issue the issue I've got with the current River meal out but it's basically looking like it's impossible we'll CSS it's impossible to do what I wanted to do so I need to you know recode CSS to do what I wanted to do yes yes the site CSS I'm talking about the language yeah it's it's quite a language is uh just just a couple more questions here uh we now have the switch uh okay the 3ds is you know 200 years old at this point what are your thoughts of this this rumor going around that Pokemon stars exist on the switch it was reported by Eurogamer that's you know that's people from your country I think it's definitely possible but I don't see them jumping straight I mean I can see them going on to switch soon but I can't see even going exclusively to switch if they are going to make the jump inside generation seven then I can't see even doing anything but having it be a cross generation game and having a free ds3 and a switch release oh okay I don't like I've ever heard anyone like pitch that concept I think that's the only way they can do it because otherwise they're segmenting their user base or they're annoying 66 million people who are free Diaz's that compared to the three billion people who have switches right now yeah basically they have to do this right I mean I'm expecting a free Deus game next no matter what regardless of if stars is real do you think we're getting like a third version though I mean we didn't we didn't get Z even though you know people say that Z was being worked on I don't know if if you had any sources that said differently I mean we got a weed in getting a car outside mom we didn't get anything for x and y we got a sequel to black and white like we haven't had a third version since 2008 yeah um I think it's possible they wouldn't be like a generic fair version like platinum was like emerald was because gang freak 1 to surprise us and so doing what's expected next would be not surprising us so whether we've got a third version every got diamond depower remakes whether we've got a nice equal second canto whether we've just got something bizarrely new in an in a new region without new Pokemon I think they're going to surprise us it's hard to say right now I mean I'd like that Nepal remakes because alright now I'm starting to feel nostalgic about it yeah which makes me sad because I was in my final year of university when Rhodes came out and I was covering them and that's like oh god I'm nostalgic that when I was at university oh my god would you would you want a sweater ocean though like is that something you'd look for like if if they if they did what you said if they'd in a 3ds and a switch version I feel like you'd buy both just because you'd have to but would you want it on switch would you want to play it on switch uh sure why not I mean it's a it's a portable device and that's the key thing about Pokemon that's why Pokemon hasn't been on a home console yet because it would lose for portal aspect we have no benefits so it would do everything it can do on the 3ds and cept it can also be played on the TV so I'll be fine with a switch version and the images people think you know have done stuff which they probably shouldn't have who has made the game's render at 1080p it makes for games with gorgeous just thrown some new textures in yeah and it would be amazing I mean that's another thing which makes me think about it not moving to switch yet though because people would be expecting like this massive overhaul they'd be expecting always can be like Zelda it can be like xenoblade chronicles it's like no it wouldn't it would be Sun and Moon in high def assembly in terms of the engine and that would probably dishearten people a bit see I'm uh I I would love that yeah I'd personally be absolutely fine with it but I know a lot of people would be saying oh god this hasn't evolved at all yes yes they wouldn't do until generation 8 that's why before you're a gamer a rumor happened does like are thinking okay I'll probably move to switch but not until generation a in 2019 and so I know basically whatever they are doing next if I'm moving to switch we have to be careful with how we do it they have to make sure they don't cut off their user base they have to make sure everything works fine they have to make sure it looks nice but the models look nice now anyway funding that's why the games don't run so well on the 3ds the models are too good yeah yeah that was and that was what kind of one of my complaints about Sun and Moon is how can Game Freak which you know they're not they're not a first-party developer but come on they make they make the Pokemon games but how can how can Game Freak make a game that runs so poorly on the new 3ds like it just kind of boggles my mind that that they you could have either you know made some changes to make it run smoothly what whatever the changes those had to be or they had something bigger in mind which kind of that kind of always stuck out to me why I like that Eurogamer kind of seemed like okay I can believe that and and like you said it's very easy to turn those model even though you shouldn't it's very easy to turn those models into 1080p and make them look great yeah and another thing which which makes me think maybe you're a gamer right about it is the waiver Sun and Moon kind of ditches the hole to screen thing I mean it never uses both screens vitally at the same time it's always one or the other yeah and then there's the whole removal for PSS and replacement with festival Plaza and its own weird friendless I mean but if that's not set preparing for like a switch compatibility I don't know what is yeah because it's so separate from how the 3ds would work and it's so and it feels like a step back from the PSS because the PSS was perfect for a dual screen device so that made me think maybe the gyro game arena is correct maybe it will be on switch next maybe yeah yeah I mean I feel like I trust your word more than anyone's if anyone knows place is not a confirmation this is not a confirmation you heard it here first don't be so mean mass confer so I got like two more questions one is very important why do people take such bad screenshots of magazines and send them to you well they don't really send them to me I find them people who leak coracoid we tend to do it anonymously around the internet in Japan and scanning it is legally iffy and so dodgy pictures really the only way to do it and even then it's like questionable it's like 2017 we all have cell phones we are cameras on her cell phone take a good picture guys come on but it's part of what makes the hype season exciting isn't it that's true something about like a badly taken photo where like half the jet and his copy is unreadable and yeah let me come on guys I just want to know what this is uh well Joe I think that's kind of all I have for you unless you want it you know tell me your secrets about you know future Pokemon games that I know you know uh I don't have anything else he says like man I feel like you have the resources I might but I am pretty much in the dark at the moment all right well Joe you run a fantastic website you you are you've always been super nice on Twitter and every time we

writer from Canada and you need to know will has stolen my number one spot on my list of favorites I know I'm like 2 episodes behind but I recently listened to episode 261 and I have never related with anyone more than I did with will on that episode will you are a champ first off I feel your pain one punch man has left a giant empty void in my soul now that I finished it and I have already watched it all three times and I want more I've been told to watch mob psycho which is by the same person but I haven't gotten to it yet maybe you'll like it though if you do watch it make sure you mention how you like it or not like it I suppose also you guys asked what your favorite pokeballs are and I'm also with dusk ball for the win so yeah there it is thanks so much for making an amazing podcast also thanks for will for being a stand-up guy Joe that's nice to have things in common with other people so I appreciate that and the actual name of the other anime I believe is mob psycho 100 I have not watched it yet but it is on the list there's a few other anime pronounced correctly that I need to get through hata Megara know ah before I get to you mob psycho 100 please move next I say Hana me now I also look forward to watching that thank you for the suggestion I loved one punch man so I won Hana May in my life right now it's a digi mama Anthony writes in from Long Island New York hello is e crew so first things first I want to thank Wilfred Vance on which supplements to use a couple episodes when I wrote in I cannot take the case Ian before bed though because it keeps me awake so if he has any other suggestions please let me know he's Jason Jason Jason isn't Kayson throughout the day isn't the intended use of casein it is the slow digesting protein so you take it before you go to bed so it digests all night while you're asleep and then you take it when you first wake up in the morning so it suggests all day gotcha also Micah we do hate when people say oh you live in Long Island it is an actual Island so we live on it Rhode Island is just the state so you live in it mimei to it my main reason for writing in today was to address closed pocus tops on Easter Sunday my girlfriend and I went to the grandparents house on in sorry in Rye New York like the brown talked about Will Anderson hometown dude I grew up in Port Chester shout out we went on I want you guys go on yeah yeah we went on a walk on the boardwalk a couple blocks away and of course I opened Pokemon go to see if there was any stops gyms or Pokemon I wouldn't commonly see on Long Island every stop that was a store or monument on the boardwalk was closed and I was confused because it seemed because it wasn't the season to technically be at the beach but the to poke stops at the main gate were not closed which kind of confused me why every poke is stopped behind the main gate why close every poka stop behind the main gate just wanted to inform you guys that it is happening in other areas of the country sorry for the longest email my daughter and I really enjoy the podcast shout-out to Anthony's daughter thanks for all your hard work on the podcast and mythical you are all my favorite by the way SBG a little bit more since the podcast wouldn't exist without him Anthony so I'm surprised because the boardwalk at ripe Leyland which is what he's talking about you that never closes I when I was in high school we used to go there like during lunch in the middle of the winter and hang out so like it's not I mean it is in a park and technically it's a public park but it doesn't close I mean closes at night but not during the daytime so that's really weird that the pokey stops would have been closed during that time like Playland Park is closed which is a amusement park but the boardwalk part is always open it's where they filmed big I'm throwing out all my facts all at once I appreciate it all effect yeah I don't know I was there I was there the night they filmed that part of big really that's a story for another time oh man I need to hear that story another time I don't know why why it would be closed but it is good to hear that you know Milwaukee is not the only one city in the world where things are Oh closing we're there things are closing I listen to 60 DB and they actually had an article on about the Milwaukee parks shutting down and closing the stops and everything in the lawsuit that's going on so it's becoming more national you're gonna make national news dude is it not cut local man local man hey this is Pokemon go and has a podcast is it not common everywhere else outside of Wisconsin that parks close at a certain time of night no no they do they do okay the whole the whole thing about the the lawsuit in the city and everything made trying to tell the Niantic to close down the stops that part is making national news yeah yeah yeah Centennial Park in Atlanta when I went that closed at 10:00 but there are that was that was like the first two weeks of Pokemon go and there was still hundreds of people in the park after 10:00 and didn't didn't care breaking the law we didn't talk about this in news but with the last Pokemon go update there was some recent changes to the API to make it I don't know how to word this without being like wrong in some extent pretty much it made it seem that knee antic is setting up the platform that Pokemon go is based on to license that platform out so that other games could do what Pokemon go does like a couple months ago we heard about like a Harry Potter go ah with recent changes to the API it's like more obvious that that is what they're getting ready to do so to go back to will story about how Milwaukee will continue to be in the news about this is because if Niantic license out the platform to other companies there will be more AR games which would then go back to them continuing to fight with Milwaukee and probably other cities and states right it's only a matter of time when something does as well as Pokemon did Pokemon go did before there's a million versions of it I'm sure knee antic would love to make money off a Harry Potter ago and just absolutely license that to somebody and just take twenty percent or however much they take and continue doing what they're doing this message is from Henry from Irvine California hey SP J's and others just wanted to say how much I like your podcast and I have a couple questions one what are the origins of the podcast and two what pokemon remake would you like to see and three what is your favorite game on Nintendo switch Travis is my favorite SBJ is close behind hashtag Travis for good Henry will doesn't have a switch correct Michael what's your favorite game on switch I real quick just want to point out that that was a call out to a hashtag that we that we made on Twitter where what was trending was hashtag travel for good and I misread it as Travis for good and I'm really happy that somebody remembers that uh uh what was the question favorite favorite game on switch Mario Kart right now Elda is my favorite zelda of all time so I feel like that's probably going to be my favorite switch game for a very long time uh as a switch owner I also enjoyed Zelda I am currently playing cuida Priya Tetris which is a superior game compared to most games on switch especially a game called mario kart 8 let me rant real quick about this these games came out the same week one being brand new unless you imported it from Japan the other one being a three year old game one being $60 and also three years old one being brand new and $30 why did people make the wrong decision in life and not hit aruhya piya Tetris I had a really hard time justifying buying Mario Kart after I went on a Twitter rant saying pretty much everything you just said and more about how terrible of an idea it is to buy the game and then I got about a week into launch and I bought it look if you talk about week if let me tell you how uncomfortable it is that it displays me playing that game to all of all of my switch friends that I'm also friends with on Twitter that probably saw that Mario Kart rant if Mario Kart 8 fixed the online mode and like made it easier to make groups and a drop-in with friends and like to set up parties that might be worth another purchase which is what I'm assuming is going to happen with their paid online service in the future I am I'm not assuming I am assuming that service will be a complete disaster yeah you're probably right my my justification for buying it was that Mario Kart 8 is such an incredible game it's really good this is the same game but with the community reinvigorated because the community on the Wii U is dead and it's not coming back but I've played all those races a hundred thousand times you're right doesn't make it less fun though I mean it's if they were Oh one of the big the biggest turn-off for me was like the not fixed on line play if they were at e3 to say hey we're releasing 16 more tracks for Mario Kart 8 I would consider purchasing it for those tracks because I loved that engine so much yeah but to pay $60 for a game that I played probably easily my most played Wii U game was now maybe Monster Hunter was my most played Wii U game but don't get me wrong I love Mario Kart 8 I just don't see the I don't understand the disconnect between people wanting more things to play on switch and wanting more games and then completely not buying Puyo Puyo Tetris which is $30 you've never played it unless you've imported it from Japan and if you imported from Japan you clearly really liked Puyo Puyo Tetris that you'd probably buy it again booyah booyah Tetris has a complete story mode hey in my defense story campaign it has Tetris it has Puyo Puyo it has a combination of Tetris and Puyo Puyo it has online play what in my defense I also bought booyah Tetris because it's a good game it's an incredible hood that's very good I am so frustrated at the the switch community if you bought Mario Kart 8 deluxe spend the $30 get booyah Tetris 2 it's worth it you already spent 60 bucks on a game that already exists it's gonna be fun I'm just switching my showerhead and I'm loaded I'm sure all those fish I'm really sorry I'm sure all those people who bought Mario Cart to begin with but the $20 worth of extra tracks that's $80 I paid $80 for that game heck if I'm gonna play pay another $60 for that game and don't dare don't tell me of battle modes worth it no battle mode is not worth $60 no I don't think so either I also know that the online is fixed so I could enjoy battle mode without 2006 internet that Mario Kart 8 deluxe is based off of um maybe but the toilet hurry up easily so angry uh and I'm gonna bet that they're not gonna release any DLC for it because if they were gonna do that they would probably just release a new Mario Kart because they know people are gonna pay for it they paid $60 for a game I paid $60 for game that already exists what I mean they they ported the engine like it's it's completely up and running on switch I can't imagine after that it's it's hard to make more tracks yeah but they would just put it in a New Guinea Mario Kart 9 why wouldn't they you know because just if it's Mario Canin it would be a completely new engine no why would they do that because every single Mario Kart has a completely new engine the Rainbows want to selection for a million years to where they add one new gun and they go it's a sequel Mario Kart has always had a new engine everybody's doing that was splatoon why would they do with Mario come he does they haven't done it for the last eight games sevens was genetically different than eight yes DSP knows a 3ds game d/s was completely different than what any right they're all different and I like that about Mario Kart except seven I didn't like seven that much but I'm saying dr is good Mario Kart 8 always feels like a sequel because it's it's different enough whether that's the drifting or the items or the tracks or it's different enough whereas like splatoon 2 is literally splatoon with dual pistols that's all you get all right got a sequel I think you and I might be the only two people in the world that are not excited for splatoon too so bitter how do you feel about the dog engine line oh that's okay nice wasn't it Knox late to join you together I wanted to like splatoon one I've invested a lot of time into wanting to like it and I just couldn't I my biggest gripe was that it took four hours to play a new map I've heard that they've reduced it to two why that exists at all still boggles my mind I mean that part didn't really bother me that really bothered me anyways we don't need to go on a platoon splatoon off-topic will complain about splatoon when it comes out all right let's do a couple more emails here this email is from Jordan location on holiday in Kefalonia from the UK I don't know I don't know if I said that right or where that is hi Steve hey whoever he has with him I've been listening to the podcast for two years thank you a massive fan of the show and became a patreon backer at the beginning of the year thank you again I wanted to keep my email short and sweet I think you guys do a fantastic job the podcast brighten up brightens up my somewhat dull Monday mornings let's get this out of the way you are all fantastic but will is my favorite he has helped me out with a few questions I post on slack plus his constant need to correct Steve is very amusing I don't know if that's true one so what my one question I have no shame in admitting Charizard is my favorite Pokemon I got into the games at generation one so I have a special place my heart for this dragon that isn't a dragon unless it's mega but as we are an generation 7 should I take a step back and leave my generation 1 feelings behind and pick a new Pokemon anyways keep doing what you're doing Jordan uh so let me get one thing out of the way here will is almost always wrong that is so not true well so not true this is what I love about will though I'm gonna call out Logan here I was very mad at Logan last week and the reason being is because we had that debate about the contest and and Mike is here now maybe Michael wanna chime in and locate everyone from logan for the most part agreed with me and had every opportunity to express those opinions and he didn't instead he was like I don't like debate guys let's move on no your Logan man I love hot ok she doesn't like it when mom and dad are fighting yeah and and will and I are mom and dad and we fight all the time and I think that is one of the reasons why I love will because I don't think I've ever actually been mad at will hmm I don't think you're right there either mine I don't think I've ever liked like I I would say the same thing about Micah like Mike and I get into the dumbest arguments but I don't man I don't think it'd only I'm ever actually mad it's just like this was dumb and then five minutes later I'm like hey you wanna watch wrestling and you sent me a very stern email in January of 2013 I said she that Stern email because you were not talking to me that was the reason oh please you believe that I remember I remember everything uh Mike aha take on contest should people do it or should they be paid I'm a what for what you can't just can't just throw me into this alright last week contests the last week somebody wrote in maybe it was two weeks ago I can't even remember mr. goes whole podcast is so hotly debated somebody wrote in and said Pokemon should do a contest where people draw a Pokemon a new Pokemon and then Pokemon picks a winner oh and will said they should and I said no and Logan also said no so thank you slack for not acknowledging that Logan also said no because he did and that's why I'm mad at Logan because he he could have he could have expressed himself more but he chose not to get into mom and dad's argument and my know was because Pokemon is a billion dollar company and I don't think it's fair and while it's by choice for a person to enter a contest no one's forcing them to I still don't think it's fair to take four have those to have those artists spend the time to make a Pokemon and then to only pick one and then they don't get anything for it and you can say and there is no cash value to this contest but let's just say they get like $10,000 that that still doesn't reward anyone else for their time and I don't think it's even if there if there was no money or if there was money it's still a fact of a billion dollar corporation taking something you made and will continue to make money on it for the rest of pokemons lifetime because as we know Pokemon will outlive earth but so any plushies any t-shirts any movies uh poke mining games anything in spin-offs like it's just weird to me it's weird to have something a person would create as seeing a company that's already worth billions of dollars continue to make Billy not Billy they probably won't make billions off one pokemon but maybe millions off plush sales and action figures in movies if you made you know kora kora Mon and you know it's on the cover of a movie you're not seeing any of that money after the contest you're not singing royalties from that I got a couple feelings about the summer make them as brief as possible the the artist in me immediately hates that the freelance artist in me immediately hates the idea because I hate when companies that aren't billion-dollar companies do that I hate that when a shop down the street says we're gonna have a contest and whoever makes the coolest logo that's gonna be our new logo that's a cop-out what you're trying to do is get art for free and get a logo for free without having to pay your artists don't do that that's a really bad way to do anything the illogical person in me loves that idea though because there's something that I have I have art friends who have participated in something called the monster project which is it's a basically an art gallery that we're or a collection of art where kids will draw monsters not pocket monsters not Pokemon they'll just draw like digital monsters a monster they make up in their head they'll you know how kids will destroy like the craziest weird monsters they can think of that have twenty seven horns and 18 eyes and a million arms and whatever and there are all kinds of colors and it's great they'll take those kids drawings and they'll distribute them amongst professional artists professional illustrators and then they'll make those into actual professional illustrations and then they bring them back to the kids and show them to them and the kids absolutely love it I think from the perspective of kids seeing their Pokemon that they made up in their head turned into a real thing and being able to play that in the game they would absolutely love it but that would only be like one kid but I also think that it sets a really bad precedent by saying uh hey do our art for us and don't we that way we don't have to pay for the art thanks guys you saved us some money there was a person on Twitter a law for a Milwaukee law firm will say and they posted hey we're looking for a new logo and the winner will get twenty five thousand dollars and the only thing I could think of was why don't you just hire an artist and pay them yeah I'll pay them an hourly wage for a logo like there are so many talented people out there why do you need a contest for I've done logo design I know mica does design I know what I charge for design I know roughly what mica charges for design I've hired people for like the illustrations that we did the the profile illustrations like I paid an artist for that and I paid them an hourly wage so I know what that costs even if you were to double triple that cost per hour heck quadruple that cost per hour quadruple that hourly rate it still does not come anywhere near $25,000 correct so why are you hosting a contest to give somebody $25,000 for a logo when in reality you could pay somebody four times the amount they charge and it doesn't even come close to that what you're doing is you're getting a whole bunch of logos put in front of you for free and then what you're going to do is you're going to have somebody that you know slightly copy somebody's logo and you're gonna pay them a hundred bucks and you're gonna say what the winner was so-and-so but you know there's no proof we can't prove that was the winner but they're gonna say there was a winner that's right I mean even if they don't like even if they'd if they're not that shady about it they're still going about it in the worst way possible when they could just hire a designer full-time or have a designer on on call for any design work that they might need and it would cost them a lot less than just throwing twenty-five G's at somebody - to make them a logo because they're too lazy to - but you know hire somebody it's it's a mess I've seen that handful of times nowhere like even small businesses will be like hey design us a logo and the winner gets that's our logo now if you're a business you should factor your branding into the cost of your business and if you don't you're a bad business will you had an e you were on the side of doing the contest you had me followed I mean it's it's it's a different it's a different perspective I mean I completely agree with with Micah and you know what it may be actually becoming a like a TOMS shoes kind of issue right because you've seen the the whole was Adam ruins everything yeah yeah I'm shoes you want to do the too long didn't read for Toms so basically the people in the countries that are receiving the shoes for donations don't really need shoes and you're just putting the cobblers in those countries out of work yes so you think you're doing a good thing and yeah shoes are getting donated but you're actually hurting people yes so so I don't know but I mean just overall the idea the idea of a contest is fun but the meta you know philosophical behind it of whether it's morally good or I mean I I don't believe in rally but general for other people who do if it's morally good in the whole length of the universe do you have such a contest well maybe not this still I think it's fun to draw pictures and have fun this would be my compromise my compromise would be that you enter so you have a contest this is like I said this my compromise you have a contest of we want a fan to make a Pokemon you submit your portfolio to the Pokemon company and whether or not you need to you know design some Pokemon or do some art to fill out your portfolio you know that's on you but you submit your portfolio and then they look at everyone's portfolio before people are doing hours and hours of work and you go I like that person's portfolio let's fly that person out and let's have them design a pokemon that way you're not making thousands of people make Pokemon and then all of a sudden you're looking at a thousand different hodgepodge Pokemon and trying to pick one instead it even better I instead you're looking at somebody's talent and their range and scope of ability of like oh like look at these six pieces you did like oh you made it you did a building you did a person you did a monster you did a fan art of Bill Nye the Science Guy um you have this range uh instead of just like one pokemon that might not have fully fleshed ideals and so when you pick that winner they can work with that winner to actually fully flesh out something that's just more than an image so so here's an even better idea I think the Pokemon company should identify all the different kinds of work that they need done and then put like on a website like little mini contests of all the different kinds of work than you've done and then people submit like a little one-page description of their life history of the kind of work that they can do and then the Pokemon company will look at those and say well this person has done this kind of work in the past so that means that they can do this kind of work and then they like fly them out there or they make them pay for themselves to fly out there and then they just pay them like every two weeks to come and do the kind of work that they need to get done because it's called a job call it you can call it Pocket monster.com now they use it a different hiring light but whatever I also I also like the the concept of hey this artist did these six Pokemon instead of like hey this artist just did one Pokemon I would love to see an entire generation an ass pin off game that is just children's submitted art for created monsters that they then took and turned into actual Pokemon now because I'm the spoke matter forever yeah that's fine this is what I would want now this would be better this is that you saw 100 Pokemon drawings from children you have professional one no new poke now not a new Pokemon now that kids made up that they drew they drew with crayons on paper and they look terrible and they look ridiculous and they look hilarious and they send them to the Pokemon company and the Pokemon company has their professional artists illustrate monsters that look exactly like those but good professional art and then you put them in their own game called Pokemon kids version and its own generation now spit Anka Myka Myka they already did that it's called yokai watch Jesus as a big fan of yokai watch I'm very offended right now the burn meter is just out of control I would rather just have kids draw a really terrible current pokemon and just see like a really deform Pikachu in a game of like - like how they did how they did Kirby's the cran Kirby whatever or maybe it was a Yoshi yarn Kirby excuse me grand Kirby grand Kirby wasn't there a Kirby or a Yoshi game that was like in cran and sub y r n-- I'm pretty sure there was but I would like to see that but with badly drawn real Pokemon not no made-up Pokemon we should read this email before we got into this debate but Jackson wrote in and said Aloha SBJ and crew it's Jackson Jackson back with another email I was pushed to write this after the last episode where you guys got a heated debate about Pokemon design competition idea I myself strongly agree with will and think that these artists love taking time to make these Pokemon designs and would love it even more if they could actually get some benefit from them I know what the benefit would be besides it being just existing no no no have some self-respect as an artist a mad anyways I don't want I don't want to get into this too much I want to know I want to know the top five Pokemon you guys would like to see a mega evolution slash new form slash evolution love the show can't wait for the next episode Jackson I don't think we had need to debate about the contest anymore like I said that probably should read that prior mm-hm all I'm asking is if you're an artist have some self respect for yourself that's it if you value yourself self respect Micah you'd get a reasonable job like a good banker hey mom I concur get a real job exactly I wanted to be a banker uh Micah is a freelance artist so you know he struggles every day to put beautiful sound not a real job no self-respect not a real job not a real job top five Pokemon you would like to see mega evolution slash new forms uh my default Farfetch'd I would also go with bear tick to piggyback off that Ursaring pretty much if it's a bear Pokemon I want to see a mega form I don't know I was going to say Aerodactyl but he already has one yeah and that's it's okay [Applause] vespiquen I'd like to see it's it is vespiquen by the way we debated about this I looked it up all right it's only vespiquen because they couldn't fit more letters in there I come for alligators missing Annie they just keep asking this question over and over again and it's like eventually we'll just go through all the pokemons yeah it's it's hard to say Rabanne be can I get a Megara bombie why not yeah yeah you uh mega florges I think sure pretty much just flowers for you yeah mega sylveon mega vileplume make a grand bull nano like scramble mega set megagram mega delcatty how about that that's a whole fairy type that's that's a Pokemon people don't think about delcatty make a klefki there you go got my five wait it's klefki a fairy type yeah it's very stiff thank goodness okay I got my mega anger give me a mega mimic you cuz you know it's it's Micha it's your boy uh mega ride shoo shut up - uh pkmn cast April Fool's circa what was that will Brendel did that there we go did that fantastic bout ya notice how he did that art for free mmm yeah yeah Oh heated debates heated debates you don't know if I paid well or not I don't make an assumption uh I don't know I I'm bad at I'm bad at Megas I'm bad at like picking Megas just bliss II have a mega like oh you're asking us if we have Megas ah no mega Blissey there you go it for Mother's Day shout-out to Mother's Day oh yeah it's the Mother's Day man I feel like we've been recording for hours ah if you have any that'll wrap it up for emails if you have if you want to you know make us argue as we do week after week you can send your emails SBJ at pkmn cast calm or just go to pokemon podcast calm hit that contact button we'll get you there - or send a message and ask for the PIO box and send snail mail send the snail mail I'll never not promote snail mail here I got I got I got the snail mail address up p.o box two six one eight one Milwaukee Wisconsin five three two two six there you go it's also on the patreon page it's also on Pokemon podcast comm somewhere I messed up Pokemon of the week this week I originally was like hey we should do porygon too and then slack was like you guys already did porygon - we're gonna go with gala spot even though I am NOT a fan of doing generation 7 Pokemon mostly because there's not there's not like trivia about it and that's kind of my favorite part of Pokemon of the week in my opinion is the trivia but since we messed up and didn't have didn't have enough time to get a flush at moveset because people made for porygon - and we already did that go with gala spot here with an assault vest adamant nature 252 HP 252 attack for defense emergency exit ability with the moves first impression leech life liquidation and then your last option being Sucker Punch poison jab or aqua jet Kevin rights gala spot is a slow heavy hitter but has an amazing type and great moves first impression does a 90 power base damage and it goes first but it can only be used once until gala spot switches which can work with its ability liquidation is a straw as a solid stab type water move bleach life is also stab and heals him last move is for flexibility and coverage depending on your team he works well with people with Pokemon such as orange aru because they are slow alternatively somebody who hits hard and fast like Salim ants can lead and lead the charge with callous pod and clean up so Salamence orang guru two good choices to use with godless pod there you go sorry I'm not Travis and giving you a little more in depth but I think that's alright feel like I feel like that covers covers the bases there you did great thanks gals spot if you didn't know is a bug slash water type Pokemon only ability as emergency exit at least listed here I believe you're correct as far as I'm aware gala spot is like this like light green and a shiny one it's more white with blue highlights instead of green highlights and a little no trivia but gala spot may be based on a giant isopod and its armor of a samurai gala spot may be a combination of Goliath Goliath and isopod and that's all I got let's illustrate its pokedex entry that might give us something from Sun while flashing slash with a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws it Cleaves sweet water or even air right in - then for moon it battles skillfully with its six arms but spends most of its time peacefully meditating in caves deep beneath the sea interesting yeah I thought I think those kind of flesh out got a spot a little bit better I wouldn't have taken galas a pod for a meditator you know headspace yeah headspace er calm I would assume that's our way to get a headspace advertisement for $9.99 a month you can also be like gasp ah I think that's all we got for you guys it's uh jump over to some house cleaning clean the house here start with patreon so I updated the patreon rewards last night we do have a patreon patreon comm slash it's super effective there was a 20 and 25 dollar reward that are that are now gone and said there's now a 16 dollar reward in a new 25 dollar reward and they involved at dry shipping addresses so if you are an old you currently were backing at 20 or $25 I would suggest switching to the new 25 or like you're backing at 20 probably go down to 16 and like you're already being generous enough I don't know Matt I didn't change him to like try to pry more money out of people but the $60 a month I mm-hmm so we're gonna do a contest and so that the $60 a month uh will include uh some snail mail since that's been a recent talk so uh you'll get like what you get a monthly letter from me handwritten and my goal is most months those will include stickers and buttons inside because I have a lot of variations of stickers and buttons and I usually try to order some before a con or when I'm going to a Pokemon event so I always have different kind of stickers laying around that I wanted to start giving to patreon backers so besides a handwritten letter you'll get some stickers and buttons each month and then for $25 I wanted to do like a Google's Google hangout slash you know group video chat whatever seems to work with a set amount of people with obviously backers at that level so and I'll probably do two or three of those at the end of the month because I would assume that not everyone can make the same time so just to make sure that people at those backing at those levels you know get the actually get the rewards that's the goal also the 25 gets everything below it so you'd also get the stickers and buttons every single month too so just some new patreon rewards and just a just a big shout-out to everyone that does support us on patreon you don't have to like it just listening to the show is is just awesome enough just means a lot for people who listen and the people who write in and and if you do have like a dollar a month to throw our way it's just really really appreciated and not necessary so that's what I got there we have a sub reddit reddit comm slash are slash super effective uh what else what else we got will um I did the PKM and cast at Twitter he's not talking we've got broke my podcasts on Twitter you did o PK event cast on Facebook put me on the spot ah Micha is at Micha the brave will it'll at what at Mike of the brief yeah it is yeah I know what I'm talking about will is at wash in the sink I am at traking Lake I didn't tell and tell the Dreamsicle story should I tell her - tell the Dreamsicle story what is it Dreamsicle battle really the this this this was I will I'll tell the story now to see if people make it through housecleaning and it is housecleaning related because it made my bed dirty so I I have told this story a couple times and and Mike has been around mike has been around one or two times when I've told it and he's laughed every time so hopefully he laughs yeah every single time I don't know one of my favorite stories well I know I hope wheels heard it but I told I slightly told it in slack that's why there's now a Dreamsicle emoji and slack so Irene she has an addictive personality when it comes to you it also will has this - will used to eat an ice cream sandwich before bed every single light why do you remember everything wait a second why though is there like some is there some light back button that's ago guys litter not before bed by used to have an Ice Cream Sandwich everyday yes is it just to like treat yourself or was it like there was a light tag that you my one little treat for myself every day bit that's beautiful this because beautiful yeah so I feel like because of that instance Irene started having like an ice cream sandwich ever day before bed and then it moved and then it like switched to like those frizzy pops she would always have a frizzy pop before bed and then it's it switched over to a Dreamsicle and if you don't know what a Dreamsicle is it's like a popsicle except popsicles are ice and a dreamsicles ice cream and it's it's orange and vanilla ice cream but that yeah that's how you use like an orange dream an orange drink the drink it's that in ice cream form so Irene would have a dream school every night before bed she doesn't do that anymore I think she's onto a new a new favorite food before bed and so Irene also has insomnia so she has trouble sleeping so she takes sleep medication and her sleep medication takes anywhere between five minutes to like an hour to work but for the most part at work it it does this job does what it needs to do so III don't normally don't go to bed with Irene I usually am up to like 2:00 3:00 in the morning every single night she has to get up wait earlier for work that I do so she usually tries to go to bed around midnight I also do a lot of house closed house cleaning at night ah I also clean my house at night usually before I go to bed so it's like 12:30 in the morning I just finished probably playing some kind of game probably destiny or Final Fantasy 14 or something so I was like I'm gonna go upstairs get some laundry I'm gonna do like a load of laundry before bed and I walk upstairs and again Irene take sleep medication so all the lights are on in the bedroom and she is laying in bed with a Dreamsicle with only one bite taken out of it on her chest and she is fast asleep and I'm surely melting on her chest yeah oh absolutely I don't know how long she's been sleeping but she only got one bite of this Dreamsicle so it could've been very long so I wake her up so I shake her and she's like what what what and I was like you're sleeping with the dreams tickle on your chest and she's like oh I'm sorry I'm sorry and I was like I love this she apologized it's like you need to throw this away or eat it or something luckily it didn't get on the sheets or anything and she's like sorry sorry so I I fill up my basket with laundry and I go downstairs and I I start the washing machine then I come back upstairs to get like another load of clothes so this is like five minutes have passed right like you know I have to go the basement load the washer I probably got something to drink I probably went to the bathroom it's been a couple minutes I come back up and she again has fallen asleep with a second bite of the Dreamsicle still on her chest as I wake her up again and I like you still have the Dreamsicle it's just like oh sorry sorry [Laughter] so that boy and Irene at that point she went downstairs and and disposed of said Dreamsicle um you know I'm not one to talk i sat on a pizza before this is very true very true but that's that's one of my favorite Irene stories I have another good I have another Irene story but we'll save that for next time so if you've made it through housecleaning you have now heard the Dreamsicle story and you'll you know now will understand why there is a dream skull in in slack as Dreamsicle emoji ah shadow Tyron shout out shout out Irene that ramshackle in all of our hearts that'll end our show for you guys today I if you haven't done so already please tell a friend about our
