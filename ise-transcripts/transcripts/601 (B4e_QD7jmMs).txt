Celsius which what is that like zero (1:10 - 1:17)
fahrenheit something like that no okay (1:14 - 1:19)

low I was like yeah talking Freedom unit (1:20 - 1:26)
here 14 14 okay okay um and that's (1:23 - 1:28)
that's kind of that's yeah yeah so (1:26 - 1:29)
that's normally like the coldest it (1:28 - 1:30)
would get here in the winter we don't (1:29 - 1:34)
get colder than that really that's crazy (1:30 - 1:35)
we don't get cold we don't get hot we (1:34 - 1:37)
just kind of sit in the middle doing (1:35 - 1:39)
nothing we get wins we've got a lot of (1:37 - 1:42)
win tonight (1:39 - 1:45)
so we were like negative4 last week or (1:42 - 1:49)
something crazy like that (1:45 - 1:51)
F uh (1:49 - 1:54)
so we we have our normal news that we're (1:51 - 1:56)
going to talk about we got the Pok√©mon (1:54 - 1:59)
go Pokemon sleep uh there's still no (1:56 - 2:01)
update for scarlet and violet even (1:59 - 2:04)
though they said sometime in January so (2:01 - 2:05)
I don't know maybe by the time this (2:04 - 2:08)
podcast goes up the (2:05 - 2:12)
3.0.1 update that they said to fix I (2:08 - 2:15)
know that TM issue I don't remember what (2:12 - 2:16)
else they were supposed to fix was the (2:15 - 2:21)
in oh the in yes um that's supposed to (2:16 - 2:23)
come out by (2:21 - 2:26)
January end of January yeah yeah they (2:23 - 2:29)
got they got time there there was also (2:26 - 2:32)
maybe or maybe not a complete (2:29 - 2:34)
duplication issue (2:32 - 2:39)
again uh in the game uh so maybe that's (2:34 - 2:41)
why it's not out maybe they were like (2:39 - 2:42)
we're going to fix that (2:41 - 2:45)
too I'm not sure I'm not sure that (2:42 - 2:47)
they're like the fact that they can say (2:45 - 2:48)
that we've got a release coming out (2:47 - 2:49)
because this was like the middle of (2:48 - 2:50)
December they were like we've got a (2:49 - 2:52)
releas no it was the beginning of (2:50 - 2:53)
December they've got a release coming (2:52 - 2:57)
out at the end of January that tells me (2:53 - 3:00)
that their whole life cycle is very long (2:57 - 3:02)
and they can't they're not just going to (3:00 - 3:04)
go I will delay it by a week no if it's (3:02 - 3:06)
delayed it's delayed by like two (3:04 - 3:09)
months there was an update where they (3:06 - 3:11)
they did it very quickly I don't (3:09 - 3:13)
remember what it was though it was like (3:11 - 3:14)
a VGC (3:13 - 3:17)
thing a but it was one thing they (3:14 - 3:19)
changed but they did they fixed a couple (3:17 - 3:22)
of things really quickly usually either (3:19 - 3:24)
having to do with VGC or having to do (3:22 - 3:26)
with duplication and it seems like there (3:24 - 3:31)
are issues with both right now so (3:26 - 3:33)
well I haven't gosh I haven't followed (3:31 - 3:36)
or paid attention to Zelda (3:33 - 3:39)
news but that that was like every other (3:36 - 3:42)
week was like we found a new way to (3:39 - 3:44)
duplicate and I don't know and they and (3:42 - 3:46)
then Nintendo kept patching it so they (3:44 - 3:50)
like clearly cared this is the second or (3:46 - 3:52)
third way to duplicate (3:50 - 3:55)
in Scarlet V and I I've heard it's very (3:52 - 3:58)
complicated and whatever I don't need I (3:55 - 4:00)
wouldn't do it I don't need to do it I (3:58 - 4:02)
have n 999 of like everything because I (4:00 - 4:06)
play the game so much um but the point (4:02 - 4:09)
being is they clearly care about this (4:06 - 4:11)
both Pokemon and Nintendo since they (4:09 - 4:16)
seem to want to fix those usually so I (4:11 - 4:17)
don't know if that'll be fixed I'm sure (4:16 - 4:21)
it will be fixed um but your reminder (4:17 - 4:23)
that there's supposed to be an (4:21 - 4:26)
update this month yeah I think it will (4:23 - 4:28)
be a very difficult bug to fix if they (4:26 - 4:29)
don't just decide they're going to just (4:28 - 4:32)
remove Maro which is my my current (4:29 - 4:33)
assumption is they're just going to go (4:32 - 4:36)
oh no you don't get that Pokemon (4:33 - 4:38)
anymore cuz it's a lot of little things (4:36 - 4:40)
that have to go together for it to (4:38 - 4:43)
actually work yeah or maybe they'll just (4:40 - 4:44)
turn off sketch on transform that's the (4:43 - 4:46)
other option because they you used to (4:44 - 4:47)
not be able to sketch (4:46 - 4:51)
transform oh really yeah I was delving (4:47 - 4:53)
into the into the wiki history of sketch (4:51 - 4:56)
and yes apparently there was originally (4:53 - 4:57)
you couldn't sketch transform and they (4:56 - 5:00)
added it in like I can't remember what (4:57 - 5:02)
gen but five or six or something like (5:00 - 5:04)
that you're telling me that the Pokemon (5:02 - 5:06)
that has broke previous Pokemon games is (5:04 - 5:09)
currently breaking the the newest game (5:06 - 5:10)
colored me (5:09 - 5:14)
[Laughter] (5:10 - 5:17)
shocked um oh but why I brought up (5:14 - 5:19)
scarlet and violet first is because we (5:17 - 5:20)
are going to be talking about the (5:19 - 5:25)
epilogue today so it's been well over 10 (5:20 - 5:28)
12 days since the epilog has come out so (5:25 - 5:30)
if you haven't done it yet and you're (5:28 - 5:32)
worried about spoilers uh look at the (5:30 - 5:35)
timestamps of this video and skip that (5:32 - 5:38)
part I'm assuming if you're listening to (5:35 - 5:41)
a weekly Pokemon podcast you are (5:38 - 5:44)
probably you probably did it you're (5:41 - 5:47)
probably there if you're not I maybe (5:44 - 5:49)
life is busy I get it come (5:47 - 5:52)
back uh before we get to the epilog uh (5:49 - 5:54)
Pokemon sleep I can't remember have we (5:52 - 5:56)
done a sleep check-in with Al (5:54 - 5:59)
before at some point I think I think I (5:56 - 6:01)
have been on since (5:59 - 6:02)
I I don't play the game (6:01 - 6:04)
anymore oh you you gave what was what (6:02 - 6:05)
was (6:04 - 6:08)
the was it was it just the the weekly (6:05 - 6:10)
check-in was it the you missed a day now (6:08 - 6:12)
you missed two days now you missed three (6:10 - 6:13)
days I think that was that was part of (6:12 - 6:15)
it I I missed a few and then I was like (6:13 - 6:17)
oh well this is my excuse to uninstall (6:15 - 6:19)
it right but I wasn't really enjoying it (6:17 - 6:22)
before like it was it was both not (6:19 - 6:24)
enough gameplay and too much gaml at the (6:22 - 6:28)
same time um I'm also famously not a fan (6:24 - 6:30)
of Rog lights um which essentially this (6:28 - 6:35)
game is um so yeah I just I think it's a (6:30 - 6:37)
cool idea and I'm glad that people (6:35 - 6:39)
really like it but yeah I just I just (6:37 - 6:42)
found that like the the Pokemon that you (6:39 - 6:44)
would get would end up being like the (6:42 - 6:46)
same ones as you've talked about (6:44 - 6:47)
previously about like the different (6:46 - 6:49)
sleep Styles and stuff like that they're (6:47 - 6:51)
unless you're cheating some of them are (6:49 - 6:53)
difficult to get in some cases and it's (6:51 - 6:55)
just I didn't find it fun and I was like (6:53 - 6:57)
I don't need to catch these Pokemon (6:55 - 6:59)
again in another different type of game (6:57 - 7:01)
you know (6:59 - 7:01)
uh well there is the the news is there (7:03 - 7:10)
is a two weekl long event for lapis (7:05 - 7:14)
Lakeside opening on January 29th so not (7:10 - 7:16)
this week next week I actually thought (7:14 - 7:19)
it was this week um that'll last until (7:16 - 7:21)
February 12th I'm sure they'll do a (7:19 - 7:24)
Valentine's Day event uh Dratini Ro (7:21 - 7:26)
Dratini rals Stuffle will appear on (7:24 - 7:28)
Green (7:26 - 7:32)
Grass and then uh there will be limited (7:28 - 7:33)
Mission rewards you can get a Dratini (7:32 - 7:36)
incense a Ral incense a Stuffle (7:33 - 7:39)
incense there will be rewards for week (7:36 - 7:43)
one and week two uh these are Tim (7:39 - 7:45)
limited (7:43 - 7:48)
missions so once the once the week has (7:45 - 7:50)
passed you will no longer be able to use (7:48 - 7:54)
those incense on green grass which is I (7:50 - 7:55)
guess makes sense because those Pokemon (7:54 - 7:57)
aren't native there and they're (7:55 - 8:01)
moving um but that's a little weird that (7:57 - 8:04)
why wouldn't you just not be able to use (8:01 - 8:06)
them oh it says you can't use them on (8:04 - 8:08)
green grass I suppose you could save (8:06 - 8:09)
those incense and probably use them on (8:08 - 8:12)
lapis yes that would probably be it that (8:09 - 8:14)
they'll just keep working only if you (8:12 - 8:16)
have access to lapis or once you have (8:14 - 8:19)
access to lapis however long it (8:16 - 8:22)
takes I think last week I said it was (8:19 - 8:24)
240 because I was reading from s and (8:22 - 8:26)
then Greg says it was 230 from what I've (8:24 - 8:28)
seen the app is saying (8:26 - 8:32)
240 in the news section of the app (8:28 - 8:35)
so maybe it's (8:32 - 8:38)
240 yeah a good almost hundred sleep (8:35 - 8:41)
styles from the last Island before that (8:38 - 8:42)
I (8:41 - 8:45)
think (8:42 - 8:48)
yeah I think it's interesting that this (8:45 - 8:49)
is I guess this is the way they're doing (8:48 - 8:52)
adding new Pokemon in right they're not (8:49 - 8:54)
changing the previous places they're (8:52 - 8:57)
adding the new ones on at higher levels (8:54 - 8:58)
which means that you're you're not then (8:57 - 9:00)
I guess having to I mean I mean there's (8:58 - 9:01)
been some cases where they've added them (9:00 - 9:04)
in Via events um but in most it seems to (9:01 - 9:06)
be like mostly they're adding them in (9:04 - 9:08)
through the new location which is an (9:06 - 9:09)
interesting way of doing things unless (9:08 - 9:11)
I've got that completely wrong I think (9:09 - 9:13)
it's com a combination I think they've (9:11 - 9:15)
added far more Pokemon through events (9:13 - 9:17)
just to the islands that have already (9:15 - 9:20)
existed um I'm not sure how many islands (9:17 - 9:22)
they're going to end up (9:20 - 9:25)
releasing I people seem very excited (9:22 - 9:28)
about lapis like it is the first New (9:25 - 9:30)
Island (9:28 - 9:34)
being added so I think you know you have (9:30 - 9:36)
the hardcore the hardcore sleep players (9:34 - 9:39)
that want that level cap to be raised (9:36 - 9:44)
from 50 to whatever I would imagine a (9:39 - 9:46)
lot of players are not even there yet I (9:44 - 9:51)
feel like my strongest Pokemon is (9:46 - 9:55)
33 maybe something like that mine is (9:51 - 9:57)
definitely weaker than that because I am (9:55 - 10:00)
I am in the process of of falling off (9:57 - 10:04)
the game kind of like Al did um I woke (10:00 - 10:05)
up this morning rolled over to press the (10:04 - 10:07)
button and then realized I forgot to (10:05 - 10:09)
press it when I went to sleep last night (10:07 - 10:11)
and that is not the first time that's (10:09 - 10:14)
happened in the last week I don't know I (10:11 - 10:16)
like the (10:14 - 10:19)
game but maybe not (10:16 - 10:21)
enough what what I tried to do Hannah (10:19 - 10:23)
maybe you should try this what I tried (10:21 - 10:26)
to do before I quit it completely was I (10:23 - 10:28)
bundled together all of the like (10:26 - 10:30)
actually doing the catching and stuff (10:28 - 10:34)
like that onto the Sunday um so that I (10:30 - 10:35)
all through most of the week all I was (10:34 - 10:37)
doing was pressing the button and then (10:35 - 10:39)
pressing the button and then on Sunday I (10:37 - 10:40)
connected it and you can even I think (10:39 - 10:42)
you can go through them individually or (10:40 - 10:44)
you can just say to the game just catch (10:42 - 10:46)
one right do whatever you want and it's (10:44 - 10:48)
quite an interesting different way of (10:46 - 10:50)
playing it the only problem with that is (10:48 - 10:52)
you only get the Pokemon at the level (10:50 - 10:54)
you were (10:52 - 10:57)
at on your first on your last time (10:54 - 10:58)
playing the game so you're not even (10:57 - 11:01)
looking at it you're just cashing you're (10:58 - 11:04)
just cashing in on Sunday yeah that's (11:01 - 11:06)
exactly what I did I didn't find (11:04 - 11:08)
crazy it was I think the way I would (11:06 - 11:11)
describe it was it was less feeling like (11:08 - 11:14)
a chore but still like it was something (11:11 - 11:16)
I was doing because I felt like I should (11:14 - 11:18)
do it rather than because I was actually (11:16 - 11:20)
enjoying it yeah I've been doing that a (11:18 - 11:22)
little bit this week and so I've I've (11:20 - 11:23)
had a couple of those days where I've (11:22 - 11:25)
built up some of the Sleep research and (11:23 - 11:28)
do multiple of them in one day but I (11:25 - 11:31)
don't en that I actually find that less (11:28 - 11:32)
fun than being more involved with the (11:31 - 11:35)
game so I think I just need to reverse (11:32 - 11:37)
course and get more involved with the (11:35 - 11:40)
game a little bit again start using the (11:37 - 11:43)
not not not Steve's calculator but the (11:40 - 11:45)
other calculator that helps you figure (11:43 - 11:47)
out what the best team is my calculator (11:45 - 11:49)
is still doing (11:47 - 11:52)
strong no I haven't used my calculator (11:49 - 11:53)
in a while because I because like at at (11:52 - 11:57)
a certain point you just you start (11:53 - 12:01)
realizing that like oh this is bad this (11:57 - 12:03)
is bad this is bad like you don't need (12:01 - 12:05)
the calculator I think the calculator's (12:03 - 12:07)
ni was super nice for like Eevee week (12:05 - 12:09)
like oh I have like three (12:07 - 12:12)
EVs and I'm G to like pull up what they (12:09 - 12:14)
evolve into and I'm just going to like C (12:12 - 12:17)
real quick to see like okay this one is (12:14 - 12:20)
slightly better um because what what (12:17 - 12:22)
when it was Eevee week I think I walked (12:20 - 12:24)
away with 14 Eevees and I think away I (12:22 - 12:26)
threw away 11 of them because I was like (12:24 - 12:29)
oh these are not good at all I'm not (12:26 - 12:30)
going to put the candy (12:29 - 12:32)
in (12:30 - 12:36)
um yeah I I I think my my problem with (12:32 - 12:41)
Pokemon sleep isn't the game it's well (12:36 - 12:44)
it's it's like the stigma around (12:41 - 12:48)
sleeping like I always miss breakfast I (12:44 - 12:52)
just I'm sleeping between 6:00 a to 12: (12:48 - 12:55)
P like like the the the three time (12:52 - 12:58)
stamps the three time separations aren't (12:55 - 13:01)
even the same length because like dinner (12:58 - 13:03)
is like 12 hours (13:01 - 13:07)
right yep because it's 6 to 12 12 to 6 (13:03 - 13:10)
and then dinner is there and so like I (13:07 - 13:12)
knew before even sleep coming out or (13:10 - 13:15)
playing sleep that like every single (13:12 - 13:18)
sleep app puts my category of sleeping (13:15 - 13:19)
at a (13:18 - 13:22)
disadvantage so like I would probably (13:19 - 13:25)
have found an anx this is the news I (13:22 - 13:28)
have another week on topalo another no (13:25 - 13:30)
onx I guess I have tomorrow to still (13:28 - 13:33)
figure that out (13:30 - 13:38)
um but every sleep app is like oh the (13:33 - 13:40)
you should be going to bed by 10:00 you (13:38 - 13:42)
should be waking up by 6 and (13:40 - 13:46)
like there are people also like me who (13:42 - 13:48)
sleep mostly during the morning and then (13:46 - 13:50)
wake up in the afternoon like there's (13:48 - 13:52)
lots of construction workers third shift (13:50 - 13:55)
workers security guards overnight people (13:52 - 13:57)
at like Walmart like this is it's not (13:55 - 13:59)
uncommon for people to have my sleep (13:57 - 14:01)
schedule but we're treated like these (13:59 - 14:04)
second class citizens so all these sleep (14:01 - 14:07)
apps no one wants to appreciate us but (14:04 - 14:10)
like I never get breakfast I just I I'm (14:07 - 14:13)
like I I'll wake up at like 12:05 and (14:10 - 14:15)
then be like should have woke up 10 (14:13 - 14:17)
minutes earlier I guess well what you (14:15 - 14:18)
need to do Steve is you need to get a (14:17 - 14:20)
second phone and set that to a different (14:18 - 14:22)
time zone and that's your Pokemon sleep (14:20 - 14:24)
phone and the only thing is for is (14:22 - 14:26)
Pokemon sleep and you set it to whatever (14:24 - 14:28)
time zone it would be that would mean (14:26 - 14:30)
that you're sleeping at at whatever time (14:28 - 14:31)
the game wants you (14:30 - 14:34)
to that would work yeah I'm not saying (14:31 - 14:37)
it's a good idea but it would it would (14:34 - 14:38)
do (14:37 - 14:40)
something I do I do think it's a little (14:38 - 14:42)
weird that like breakf breakfast starts (14:40 - 14:43)
at (14:42 - 14:48)
6 um and not 4 because the day resets at (14:43 - 14:50)
4 and you you again you have like dinner (14:48 - 14:52)
that is 12 hours long you have lunch and (14:50 - 14:54)
breakfast that are 6 hours long and (14:52 - 14:56)
anytime I'm like getting ready for bed (14:54 - 14:58)
and I'm like walking downstairs I have (14:56 - 15:00)
like one of those Google home in my (14:58 - 15:02)
kitchens my my kitchen I don't have (15:00 - 15:04)
multiple kitchens I have a Google home (15:02 - 15:07)
in my kitchen and it'll say like once it (15:04 - 15:09)
hits 4:00 it'll say like good morning (15:07 - 15:12)
Steve and I'm like I mean yeah you're (15:09 - 15:13)
you're not wrong like a lot of people (15:12 - 15:15)
get up at 400 a.m. because they like (15:13 - 15:17)
need to be at work at like five or (15:15 - 15:22)
six 4 AM is the worst time always sorry (15:17 - 15:24)
that's but it's the it's the worst hour (15:22 - 15:26)
as as someone who was woken up by my kid (15:24 - 15:28)
at 4:00 a.m. this morning I can agree (15:26 - 15:32)
with you on that one it is not a great (15:28 - 15:32)
time sometimes if I'm working late (15:32 - 15:38)
enough I go to bed at like yes 6: a.m. (15:34 - 15:39)
and then I can squeeze in breakfast (15:38 - 15:42)
before I there are a few times where (15:39 - 15:44)
where where I catch a Steve stream not (15:42 - 15:46)
in my evening but in my morning because (15:44 - 15:47)
he's still streaming when I get (15:46 - 15:50)
[Laughter] (15:47 - 15:55)
up yeah there like I I feel like I would (15:50 - 15:57)
have less frustration with sleep if I (15:55 - 16:00)
could hit breakfast every day cuz I'm (15:57 - 16:04)
I'm literally missing probably like five (16:00 - 16:06)
to six me like sometimes I hit breakfast (16:04 - 16:08)
but for the most time I'm missing it and (16:06 - 16:11)
therefore like I'm I should be master (16:08 - 16:13)
rank eight but I'm master rank four (16:11 - 16:16)
because yeah I just didn't get that so (16:13 - 16:19)
and if it give you an F just because you (16:16 - 16:21)
don't sleep on a normal sleep schedule (16:19 - 16:23)
so like I'm still having fun with it I (16:21 - 16:24)
still like it like this morning was (16:23 - 16:27)
frustrating waking up to like I you know (16:24 - 16:30)
I'm master rank whatever and it's like I (16:27 - 16:33)
had great slumbering sleep or whatever (16:30 - 16:35)
and it's like oh you know day six and (16:33 - 16:38)
we're still getting Diglett rat a Gulpin (16:35 - 16:40)
geod dude that was literally my morning (16:38 - 16:41)
and it's like (16:40 - 16:45)
ah I'm literally master rank why am I (16:41 - 16:48)
getting Pokeball rank Pokemon at Sunday (16:45 - 16:50)
morning so like that's frustrating but (16:48 - 16:53)
that's just like RNG in most in all (16:50 - 16:56)
Pokemon (16:53 - 16:56)
games uh all right well well let's (16:57 - 17:04)
actually let's let's get the non epilog (17:00 - 17:06)
stuff out of the way and then after the (17:04 - 17:07)
break we can talk about the epilog (17:06 - 17:09)
that'll make it real easy uh so we (17:07 - 17:13)
didn't cover this like two weeks ago the (17:09 - 17:16)
Pokemon TV app will be removed from (17:13 - 17:18)
digital stores and will end permanently (17:16 - 17:21)
in (17:18 - 17:24)
March uh I don't think they have an (17:21 - 17:25)
exact (17:24 - 17:28)
date but uh Pokemon company announced on (17:25 - 17:32)
the website today today was when was (17:28 - 17:35)
that that was January (17:32 - 17:41)
8th that the sof IGN uh that the Pokemon (17:35 - 17:44)
TV app will sunset sunset is the buzz (17:41 - 17:46)
Tech word for closing the they could (17:44 - 17:48)
just say we're closing the (17:46 - 17:51)
app I don't know why Sunset got so (17:48 - 17:52)
popular it has less negative (17:51 - 17:55)
connotations everybody loves a sunset (17:52 - 17:57)
right so (17:55 - 18:00)
pretty (17:57 - 18:04)
uh ending the free TV service app um it (18:00 - 18:06)
will be removed from digital storefronts (18:04 - 18:08)
from the Nintendo eShop from Google Play (18:06 - 18:09)
from the App (18:08 - 18:12)
Store uh they say thank you for all the (18:09 - 18:14)
fans that have enjoyed the Pokemon TV (18:12 - 18:16)

on eBay next to Flappy Bird no it (18:38 - 18:43)
doesn't say that uh you can you can (18:40 - 18:46)
continue using it until March where (18:43 - 18:49)
it'll be shut down completely it this (18:46 - 18:52)
app came out in (18:49 - 18:55)
2013 for the (18:52 - 18:57)
record that's a good long (18:55 - 18:59)
run yeah (18:57 - 19:01)
can I can I be positive for a minute (18:59 - 19:02)
before we because obviously it's very (19:01 - 19:04)
sad but I want to be positive this right (19:02 - 19:07)
is that sad it's a sunset (19:04 - 19:09)
not not that I think that it's it's good (19:07 - 19:10)
that this is going away I'm not trying (19:09 - 19:12)
to make it a positive thing this is (19:10 - 19:14)
going away but can I just talk about the (19:12 - 19:16)
fact that for 11 years there was an app (19:14 - 19:18)
where you could go and watch so many (19:16 - 19:21)
free seasons of Pokemon like I think (19:18 - 19:23)
that is wild that they actually did that (19:21 - 19:26)
and if you were watching stuff regularly (19:23 - 19:28)
on there like they kept changing it so (19:26 - 19:29)
don't know whether you could have (19:28 - 19:31)
watched everything eventually free I (19:29 - 19:33)
don't know but I wouldn't be surprised (19:31 - 19:34)
if that was the case cuz they kept (19:33 - 19:36)
rolling through all the different (19:34 - 19:38)
seasons and I just think that that is a (19:36 - 19:40)
great thing just just overall and (19:38 - 19:42)
obviously it's sad that it's going away (19:40 - 19:43)
but the fact that they ever did it I (19:42 - 19:46)
think is really (19:43 - 19:46)
good yeah I'm sure that they're like it (19:46 - 19:52)
wasn't making any (19:50 - 19:53)
money yeah because there's no ads or (19:52 - 19:57)
anything there's nothing on there ads (19:53 - 20:02)
and there's obviously an operation cost (19:57 - 20:06)
to like hold these videos have people (20:02 - 20:09)
access them like the streaming like the (20:06 - 20:10)
reason like something like Amazon or (20:09 - 20:12)
twitch or is so expensive is because (20:10 - 20:15)
like delivering video is on the Internet (20:12 - 20:18)
is expensive how long was (20:15 - 20:21)
it until YouTube became (20:18 - 20:23)
profitable that's like the second (20:21 - 20:25)
biggest website in the World Behind (20:23 - 20:27)
Google (20:25 - 20:32)
um it is like I I'm I'm positive that (20:27 - 20:34)
four or five even maybe like two years (20:32 - 20:36)
ago I probably came on the show and was (20:34 - 20:38)
like why don't they just put all the (20:36 - 20:41)
episodes on and charge like five six (20:38 - 20:43)
seven dollar a month and compete with (20:41 - 20:45)
like Netflix (20:43 - 20:48)
or Prime (20:45 - 20:50)
video I I don't know if they could like (20:48 - 20:52)
in retrospect I don't know if they could (20:50 - 20:54)
have like I don't know if enough people (20:52 - 20:56)
just cared like I want a thousand (20:54 - 20:58)
episodes of the Pokemon anime and I will (20:56 - 21:01)
pay $5 a month for that like I I some (20:58 - 21:03)
people out there I'm sure would do that (21:01 - 21:06)
as a I don't even think I would do that (21:03 - 21:08)
I I would do it for one if if we got (21:06 - 21:11)
them the subed versions of the Japanese (21:08 - 21:12)
ones the day after I would pay it for (21:11 - 21:15)
that oh yeah um if if they but yeah if (21:12 - 21:17)
it's just like here's everything past (21:15 - 21:19)
the stuff you care about now like yeah (21:17 - 21:21)
no I'm not I'm not doing that if they (21:19 - 21:23)
put everything on there including s (21:21 - 21:26)
casts of the new anime yes I think that (21:23 - 21:27)
would draw more people but still maybe (21:26 - 21:30)
not enough (21:27 - 21:30)
I wonder if their deal with Netflix (21:31 - 21:35)
changed their thought process of the app (21:33 - 21:40)
of like we we can be on whatever service (21:35 - 21:43)
in the UK we can be on this service in (21:40 - 21:47)
Canada we can be on normal TV in Japan (21:43 - 21:49)
and we get paid for all of that stuff (21:47 - 21:51)
and the ads get introduced and all that (21:49 - 21:53)
stuff and then Netflix just gives us a (21:51 - 21:56)
big chunk of money in America and we (21:53 - 21:59)
sign an x amount of agreements (21:56 - 22:02)
and then after that we can Relic that (21:59 - 22:05)
stuff back out it's not even just (22:02 - 22:07)
America because it is here as well it's (22:05 - 22:08)
just we don't get like the brand new (22:07 - 22:11)
stuff straight away like all of all of (22:08 - 22:14)
uh Journeys and to be a master is now on (22:11 - 22:16)
on UK Netflix so we have everything (22:14 - 22:19)
except Horizons on there (22:16 - 22:22)
now well I say everything I don't mean (22:19 - 22:24)
everything obviously I mean everything (22:22 - 22:26)
from the last like six years right (22:24 - 22:28)
obviously I don't know there was a (22:26 - 22:30)
fantas video by Dunkey talking about um (22:28 - 22:32)
streaming services and he does a bit (22:30 - 22:33)
where he talks about where you can watch (22:32 - 22:35)
all of the because on the website on the (22:33 - 22:37)
Pokemon website it's got a list of where (22:35 - 22:39)
you can watch all the series and you (22:37 - 22:41)
have it's like seven different streaming (22:39 - 22:43)
services you have to go through and the (22:41 - 22:45)
way he delivers it is just fantastic but (22:43 - 22:47)
yeah is it yeah it's the same here there (22:45 - 22:49)
are like seven different Services you (22:47 - 22:50)
have to go through if you want to watch (22:49 - 22:54)
them all yeah (22:50 - 22:58)
um but it I'm assuming uming this is (22:54 - 23:00)
just money right like this is just we (22:58 - 23:02)
don't want to continue paying this it it (23:00 - 23:05)
could also be that they maybe they had a (23:02 - 23:08)
10-year contract with whoever made this (23:05 - 23:09)
TV app just like they had a contract (23:08 - 23:12)
with direwolf digital (23:09 - 23:15)
for rest rest in peace Pokemon Trading (23:12 - 23:18)
Card Game Online um but you know like (23:15 - 23:20)
they like they never talked about (23:18 - 23:21)
direwolf digital even when they refer to (23:20 - 23:24)
Pokemon home they they rarely mention (23:21 - 23:29)
ilka so I I don't think I I maybe maybe (23:24 - 23:31)
somebody at the Pokemon company out in (23:29 - 23:33)
bellw is like actually the we we have (23:31 - 23:36)
one computer running all of these (23:33 - 23:39)
episodes on like I don't I I'm sure (23:36 - 23:41)
there was just some delivery service (23:39 - 23:45)
that they paid for to like manage this (23:41 - 23:47)
app because it was pretty simple it was (23:45 - 23:50)
like the most (23:47 - 23:52)
barebones I don't think we want to get (23:50 - 23:54)
into delivery of of video on like that (23:52 - 23:57)
is a whole a whole other thing I do (23:54 - 23:59)
think it is just it's also just in line (23:57 - 24:01)
with the industry as a whole like you're (23:59 - 24:04)
seeing the Contracting of all like we (24:01 - 24:07)
went from like Netflix being most of the (24:04 - 24:09)
streaming to everybody has a streaming (24:07 - 24:12)
service and now we're we're seeing that (24:09 - 24:16)
Mo you know contract again um and I (24:12 - 24:18)
think it's just just part of that and (24:16 - 24:19)
yeah then you're right the Netflix model (24:18 - 24:22)
is very good for them they go give us (24:19 - 24:24)
your content here's some money and they (24:22 - 24:26)
don't have to think about it again right (24:24 - 24:30)
that's a great deal yeah that's a that's (24:26 - 24:33)
a super good deal um we love money give (24:30 - 24:36)
me (24:33 - 24:36)
money yeah so uh that app's going away (24:39 - 24:44)
uh I I I'm sure there's probably parents (24:42 - 24:46)
listening to the show that I wouldn't be (24:44 - 24:47)
surprised if their kids like use that (24:46 - 24:49)
app I think kids like also love the (24:47 - 24:52)
YouTube app and what Disney I feel like (24:49 - 24:55)
every parent needs to own Disney plus (24:52 - 24:56)
that's what it's called right Disney (24:55 - 24:59)
plus yeah um (24:56 - 25:03)
so yeah it's just the maybe in like 10 (24:59 - 25:04)
more years they'll bring the app back (25:03 - 25:07)
and be like nope the Netflix service is (25:04 - 25:09)
no longer working we're going back to (25:07 - 25:10)
the cable (25:09 - 25:13)
service they just got to keep it in (25:10 - 25:16)
store it's it's been a good app they (25:13 - 25:19)
were able to put it in a good number of (25:16 - 25:21)
places like on a good number of devices (25:19 - 25:23)
and different ways you could access it (25:21 - 25:26)
and being able to watch any of the (25:23 - 25:28)
episodes that were on there just for (25:26 - 25:32)
free with no ads for a decade was (25:28 - 25:35)
amazing (25:32 - 25:37)
yeah it's all right when Apple buy both (25:35 - 25:41)
Nintendo and uh Disney then we'll get (25:37 - 25:43)
all Pokemon on Disney plus obviously (25:41 - 25:46)
that's yeah somebody call up Tim Tim (25:43 - 25:50)
Apple like why why why is Apple TV needs (25:46 - 25:52)
more content they could have had Pokemon (25:50 - 25:55)
I don't think Apple TV has a lot of kids (25:52 - 25:57)
content I I think you mean Apple TV plus (25:55 - 26:00)
Apple TV (25:57 - 26:00)
brings together all your stre services (26:00 - 26:05)
on your device Apple TV plus is the (26:02 - 26:07)
actual content from (26:05 - 26:10)
Apple Pokemon TV could have had an apple (26:07 - 26:14)
Vision Pro app Netflix is not making (26:10 - 26:17)
one they could have they they could have (26:14 - 26:20)
been the market for the $3,500 headset (26:17 - 26:22)
somebody over at Pokemon really dropped (26:20 - 26:25)
the ball on that Pokemon fans love to (26:22 - 26:26)
spend ridiculous amounts of money you (26:25 - 26:28)
know yeah they could be sitting with (26:26 - 26:31)
their Wailord plush and be (26:28 - 26:33)
watching Ash in virtual reality right (26:31 - 26:35)
now somebody to be fair they probably (26:33 - 26:37)
they probably don't need the Pokemon TV (26:35 - 26:39)
app they just need some other random (26:37 - 26:41)
thing where you can like see Pokemon in (26:39 - 26:43)
the world and you know that some people (26:41 - 26:46)
will buy it just for that that's true (26:43 - 26:49)
yeah that's very very true um all right (26:46 - 26:53)
let's do uh last bit of not epilog stuff (26:49 - 26:58)

Shadow Scyther Skarmory and golette will (29:09 - 29:13)
be in three star the only one that can (29:11 - 29:15)
be shiny is (29:13 - 29:20)
Scyther so skip skip that I guess as (29:15 - 29:22)
well you really want (29:20 - 29:24)
Scyther and there will be another new (29:22 - 29:26)
paid (29:24 - 29:28)
research which for (29:26 - 29:32)
$5 uh you will get stard Stardust XP one (29:28 - 29:34)
incense one incubator three silver pin (29:32 - 29:36)
apps it counters with a vent themed (29:34 - 29:39)
Pokemon an event theme Avatar (29:36 - 29:42)
pose uh it is timed research that means (29:39 - 29:45)
if you buy it and you do not complete it (29:42 - 29:48)
before February 1st you lose what the (29:45 - 29:49)
rewards (29:48 - 29:52)
are uh you and then the to be fair the (29:49 - 29:54)
pose is pretty (29:52 - 29:59)
cool I don't know $5 cool but (29:54 - 30:01)
well most of the poses if you're going (29:59 - 30:04)
to get them from the shop are 500 coins (30:01 - 30:08)
I believe so this is kind of like that (30:04 - 30:10)
but also who's buying a pose from the (30:08 - 30:12)
shop come on I've bought at least one (30:10 - 30:15)
with coins but not with dollars this is (30:12 - 30:18)
with dollars you can't earn those the (30:15 - 30:22)
same way I I think all of my poses have (30:18 - 30:24)
come from research I don't think (30:22 - 30:26)
I've yeah (30:24 - 30:28)
same (30:26 - 30:29)
I don't think I've bought a single thing (30:28 - 30:32)
in the store at all I think all all the (30:29 - 30:36)
customization of my avatar I've got from (30:32 - 30:38)
research or whatever free stuff they (30:36 - 30:40)
gave you at some (30:38 - 30:43)
point I don't know how how how have you (30:40 - 30:48)
felt about the uh the amount of small re (30:43 - 30:51)
paid research that yeah I'm I'm on to (30:48 - 30:53)
two minds about this stuff like I've (30:51 - 30:56)
done both of the the ones that give you (30:53 - 30:59)
the incubator every day um and I think (30:56 - 31:00)
those are great and I think they should (30:59 - 31:03)
keep doing them forever um and I will (31:00 - 31:04)
keep buying them forever if they keep (31:03 - 31:06)
doing them I'm mainly doing it right now (31:04 - 31:08)
because obviously I've got to have a lot (31:06 - 31:11)
of incubators for c tour you know um I'm (31:08 - 31:12)
going to be doing a lot of walking that (31:11 - 31:16)
weekend um but I I do I do think it's at (31:12 - 31:18)
that point where I feel like they would (31:16 - 31:20)
have some of these things would be less (31:18 - 31:23)
annoying if it was just a subscription I (31:20 - 31:25)
know we've talked about subscriptions (31:23 - 31:27)
before in this but I would be less (31:25 - 31:31)
annoyed about the paid timed research if (31:27 - 31:33)
it was subscription based right because (31:31 - 31:36)
then you're not specifically paying for (31:33 - 31:37)
that research it just comes with the (31:36 - 31:39)
subscription and then if you do it you (31:37 - 31:40)
do it and if you don't you don't it kind (31:39 - 31:43)
of feels different than I'm going to pay (31:40 - 31:45)
for this time research or a ran out of (31:43 - 31:49)
time to do it that feels really rubbish (31:45 - 31:53)
you know I don't like the paid timed (31:49 - 31:55)
research (31:53 - 31:58)
yeah Hannah I think you had thoughts (31:55 - 32:01)
I think I am mostly in agreement I do (31:58 - 32:02)
wish that they were just doing (32:01 - 32:04)
subscriptions instead of having a new (32:02 - 32:06)
paid ticket with every single thing they (32:04 - 32:10)
announce but also paid timed research so (32:06 - 32:12)
where you actually pay for something and (32:10 - 32:15)
then it it goes away if you don't finish (32:12 - 32:18)
it does not feel good (32:15 - 32:22)
either so (32:18 - 32:25)
yeah it's not like (32:22 - 32:27)
uh we're running this event this week (32:25 - 32:28)
and if you miss it you miss it it's (32:27 - 32:30)
we're running this event this week and (32:28 - 32:33)
you paid money and you missed it thanks (32:30 - 32:34)
for the (32:33 - 32:36)
money yeah and you could argue that oh (32:34 - 32:37)
well don't pay for it if you're not (32:36 - 32:39)
going to do it but life happens things (32:37 - 32:42)
happen you know like sometimes you just (32:39 - 32:44)
can't play Pokemon even though you (32:42 - 32:45)
thought you were going to be able to (32:44 - 32:47)
like especially especially if you have (32:45 - 32:49)
kids you know and does that mean I (32:47 - 32:51)
should never buy these research like I (32:49 - 32:53)
like them but there's been a I mean (32:51 - 32:55)
mostly there is one advantage to the (32:53 - 32:57)
paid timed research rather than special (32:55 - 32:58)
research and that's if you don't if you (32:57 - 33:00)
don't manage to do it in time it's not (32:58 - 33:02)
cluttering up your research (33:00 - 33:05)
forever which is what happened with froy (33:02 - 33:08)
Community Day for me I had six months of (33:05 - 33:10)
that thing in my special (33:08 - 33:13)
research oh don't don't mind me I'm (33:10 - 33:16)
still looking for 15 poliwags to finish (33:13 - 33:18)
yeah try a full year for a December (33:16 - 33:20)
Community Day research not being able to (33:18 - 33:22)
get any of (33:20 - 33:24)
them hey they're still spawning grubbin (33:22 - 33:26)
I'm still ticking away at that (33:24 - 33:28)
one I don't have anything just now (33:26 - 33:31)
except the the party play one and the (33:28 - 33:32)
one that's currently ongoing that (33:31 - 33:35)
they've not decided to finish yet oh we (33:32 - 33:37)
can party play when you come to La that (33:35 - 33:39)
is my plan that's my plan C tour I am (33:37 - 33:41)
doing all of the Party play right that's (33:39 - 33:43)
all that's all we're doing that weekend (33:41 - 33:44)
Party play all the (33:43 - 33:46)
time yeah I know there's there's (33:44 - 33:49)
conversations around like oh Niantic (33:46 - 33:51)
must have cranked up the tickets because (33:49 - 33:53)
they're not making as much money on (33:51 - 33:56)
remote raid passes (33:53 - 33:59)
which I think I think you're giving (33:56 - 34:00)
Niantic too much credit I think that's (33:59 - 34:03)
such a simp like I think even if there (34:00 - 34:06)
was unlimited remote raid passes and (34:03 - 34:09)
they were still a dollar I don't see why (34:06 - 34:11)
they still wouldn't have done this this (34:09 - 34:12)
is just (34:11 - 34:16)
like they like money road yeah like like (34:12 - 34:19)
we're making money over here but like (34:16 - 34:22)
even even logically they're different (34:19 - 34:26)
customers like why like like you have a (34:22 - 34:27)
set of people that are like I'm going to (34:26 - 34:29)
stay at home I'm going to do 20 raids a (34:27 - 34:32)
day I'm just going to keep cranking that (34:29 - 34:34)
lever which is remote raid passes and (34:32 - 34:35)
I'm going to keep doing these raids (34:34 - 34:37)
until the thing is shiny or the thing is (34:35 - 34:39)
100 or the thing is a hund shiny right (34:37 - 34:42)
like and then you have people that oh (34:39 - 34:43)
I'm going to go out for commun day and (34:42 - 34:46)
I'm going to buy this $1 thing oh that (34:43 - 34:48)
that Halloween pose does look really (34:46 - 34:49)
cool and I am going to go out this (34:48 - 34:51)
weekend and play so I will buy the $5 (34:49 - 34:53)
thing and do the Halloween Quest like (34:51 - 34:55)
they are pretty opposite like I there (34:53 - 34:58)
are players that probably would buy both (34:55 - 35:00)
um and I'm sure there are some players (34:58 - 35:03)
that are like I do leave my house a lot (35:00 - 35:05)
I want to do the egg incubator thing so (35:03 - 35:07)
I'm going to buy that and there are some (35:05 - 35:08)
people that are like I don't do eggs at (35:07 - 35:10)
all because all I do is remote raids I (35:08 - 35:14)
don't actually walk like I don't think (35:10 - 35:16)
that these tickets (35:14 - 35:19)
are because they're not making money in (35:16 - 35:20)
remote raid passes I just think these (35:19 - 35:23)
tickets are here because they like money (35:20 - 35:29)
like I and I do know that 2023 was not (35:23 - 35:33)
as profitable as 2022 or 2021 but (35:29 - 35:38)
Niantic still made over $600 (35:33 - 35:40)
million I just like to anyone that's (35:38 - 35:43)
like ah Pokemon go is (35:40 - 35:47)
dead oh $600 million is a dead game they (35:43 - 35:50)
made like 7 I think it was like $680 (35:47 - 35:53)
million I think the year before like (35:50 - 35:58)
still a lot of money still a lot of m (35:53 - 36:03)
still like top 15 top apps all time in (35:58 - 36:06)
the Apple App Store and they laid off (36:03 - 36:07)
plenty of people so they could keep even (36:06 - 36:08)
more of (36:07 - 36:13)
it yeah yeah well a lot of a lot of tech (36:08 - 36:15)
has laid off a lot of people yes that (36:13 - 36:18)
hasn't stopped yeah Microsoft has well (36:15 - 36:20)
like on their third rounds of (36:18 - 36:23)
layoffs twitch just had big (36:20 - 36:26)
layoffs (36:23 - 36:29)
um not not I (36:26 - 36:31)
don't Al you still got you're in Tech (36:29 - 36:34)
you still got a job oh yeah I'm fine I'm (36:31 - 36:37)
fine we we we had we had we had layoffs (36:34 - 36:39)
but we had five people laid off a year (36:37 - 36:42)
ago and it's a country of 500 a company (36:39 - 36:45)
of 500 people so it it was fine we're (36:42 - 36:48)
fine and I think our our our income well (36:45 - 36:50)
like we're con Consultants so there's (36:48 - 36:53)
always people who will spend unnecessary (36:50 - 36:56)
amounts of money on (36:53 - 36:58)
Consultants the the the the big ticket (36:56 - 37:01)
item I know this for sure for Niantic to (36:58 - 37:04)
do is to to pull that uh Mega Mewtwo (37:01 - 37:06)
button oh (37:04 - 37:08)
yeah but that's that's for sure coming (37:06 - 37:11)
with go Fest right that's gonna be a go (37:08 - 37:16)
Fest thing uh yeah because what Rayquaza (37:11 - 37:20)
was this past year right Mega yeah so I (37:16 - 37:23)
do I agree it will be a go go Fest I (37:20 - 37:24)
don't think it will be this this year's (37:23 - 37:26)
go Fest I think they have too many megas (37:24 - 37:29)
left cuz they've got like nine nine left (37:26 - 37:31)
do they really have nine I think it I (37:29 - 37:34)
thought it was more like five well like (37:31 - 37:37)
they haven't said it but Lucario has to (37:34 - 37:40)
make its debut next month (37:37 - 37:42)
right possibly I mean they've already (37:40 - 37:44)
got a lot of things happening for c tour (37:42 - 37:46)
like I could see them going let's leave (37:44 - 37:48)
that to go Fest and then Mega meww for (37:46 - 37:51)
next year but they could also they could (37:48 - 37:53)
pull that Mega meww lever twice because (37:51 - 37:54)
there's two of them why would they do (37:53 - 37:56)
them both at the same time when they can (37:54 - 37:59)
do them yeah I mean that's that's true (37:56 - 38:02)
as well sorry I shouldn't be giving them (37:59 - 38:03)
ideas like like they've not thought (38:02 - 38:04)
about (38:03 - 38:08)
this uh I mean like we we like Lucario (38:04 - 38:09)
is a probably Lucario is a big one I (38:08 - 38:11)
don't care about Lucario but Lucario is (38:09 - 38:14)
undoubtedly powerful uh or popular and (38:11 - 38:17)
Powerful um metag Metagross is another (38:14 - 38:19)
big one that people really like that (38:17 - 38:20)
they haven't pulled the trigger on in (38:19 - 38:22)
them Mew to I mean I guess you have like (38:20 - 38:25)
aino to those like six people out there (38:22 - 38:26)
that love aino I don't think AO is like (38:25 - 38:30)
mov the needle um well it was it's (38:26 - 38:32)
enough to get the candy and then you're (38:30 - 38:36)
done yeah I didn't even think (38:32 - 38:41)
like AO would replace L honey as like I (38:36 - 38:43)
just don't think it would be it's just (38:41 - 38:45)
normal isn't (38:43 - 38:49)
it is did is it normal fairy does it add (38:45 - 38:50)
fairy I don't actually (38:49 - 38:52)
know it's one of the ones that you (38:50 - 38:54)
always forget cuz I always forget how (38:52 - 38:57)
just how many megas there are and when I (38:54 - 38:58)
look at the list oh yeah I forgot that (38:57 - 39:02)
one had one uh it is Mega fairy or Mega (38:58 - 39:03)
fairy normal (39:02 - 39:06)
fairy yeah it goes from normal to normal (39:03 - 39:09)
fairy (39:06 - 39:09)
yeah there you go yeah I know they (39:09 - 39:14)
haven't released Heracross I'm pretty (39:12 - 39:16)
sure that's because the typing is going (39:14 - 39:19)
to mess up some metas in the PVP or (39:16 - 39:21)
something like (39:19 - 39:25)
that in the well in the weird uncapped (39:21 - 39:27)
Mega yeah (39:25 - 39:30)
pvps that they do like once a year I (39:27 - 39:33)
think that's what I heard as a reason (39:30 - 39:39)
they're speculating Mega Heracross and (39:33 - 39:39)
uh nope just Mega Heracross for the (39:40 - 39:46)
[Laughter] (39:43 - 39:49)
megas okay uh I (39:46 - 39:52)
think I think that's everything all (39:49 - 39:54)
right so we we're going to take a break (39:52 - 39:56)
when we come back uh last segment is (39:54 - 39:59)
going to be about the epilog of scarlet (39:56 - 40:01)
and violet so we will be right (39:59 - 40:05)
back and we are back from our (40:01 - 40:06)
break all right we're going to talk (40:05 - 40:10)
about the epilog spoilers for the hour (40:06 - 40:13)
and half that it probably took most (40:10 - 40:16)
people uh Hannah was this everything (40:13 - 40:19)
that you wanted to wrap up your scarlet (40:16 - 40:22)
and violet experience they answered all (40:19 - 40:24)
your (40:22 - 40:28)
questions no not not a single question (40:24 - 40:32)
was answered I think uh but it was still (40:28 - 40:35)
fun (40:32 - 40:35)
yeah it was a fun time it was kind of (40:36 - 40:42)
the perfect (40:39 - 40:42)
length yeah I (40:43 - 40:49)
think go ahead I played it through twice (40:45 - 40:51)
and the fun the second time I managed to (40:49 - 40:53)
do it in about 45 minutes and I know (40:51 - 40:55)
that because I was watching your (40:53 - 40:56)
playthrough of it Steve while doing it (40:55 - 40:59)
the second time just to compare how long (40:56 - 41:01)
it takes and it was about 45 minutes and (40:59 - 41:03)
about half of that was the battles when (41:01 - 41:06)
you're absolutely spamming through the (41:03 - 41:09)
dialogue if you don't like to (41:06 - 41:12)
read four battles I (41:09 - 41:16)
think I think five I think five oh five (41:12 - 41:19)
yeah I think you're right because yeah (41:16 - 41:22)
NE neona is the fourth one and then you (41:19 - 41:26)
battle pet petun yeah yeah um and then (41:22 - 41:28)
the battle (41:26 - 41:30)
you I think I think Hannah and I are in (41:28 - 41:32)
the same boat where we thought they were (41:30 - 41:35)
going to like maybe answer a couple more (41:32 - 41:38)
questions and they they didn't but what (41:35 - 41:40)
they they gave isn't like necessarily (41:38 - 41:42)
bad it was (41:40 - 41:44)
just like like it was I I think the word (41:42 - 41:47)
I would use to describe the epilogue was (41:44 - 41:51)
Charming although if you don't care (41:47 - 41:54)
about the characters or if you didn't (41:51 - 41:58)
like Arvin or Penny or kir in I could (41:54 - 42:00)
easily be see you be very annoyed that (41:58 - 42:02)
you have to go through all of this (42:00 - 42:05)
dialogue um to then (42:02 - 42:08)
do a couple battles to then catch your (42:05 - 42:10)
mythical Pokemon at the (42:08 - 42:13)
end yeah that's fair I could I could (42:10 - 42:14)
definitely see why somebody be like oh (42:13 - 42:16)
my God I well I mean I've heard people (42:14 - 42:17)
be like oh there was so much dialogue (42:16 - 42:20)
and you're you're correct there was a (42:17 - 42:21)
lot of (42:20 - 42:24)
dialog it was much more of a story I (42:21 - 42:27)
mean it was it was very uh (42:24 - 42:29)
yeah much more dialogue based than the (42:27 - 42:32)
rest of the games it was dialogue battle (42:29 - 42:35)
dialogue battle dialogue battle but it (42:32 - 42:37)
also just felt fun to go through the (42:35 - 42:39)
story and I don't know I saw a lot more (42:37 - 42:41)
people talking about how much they like (42:39 - 42:44)
the characters after all of this how (42:41 - 42:46)
everybody's going to be so sad to leave (42:44 - 42:49)
these characters behind I saw so much (42:46 - 42:52)
positivity around the (42:49 - 42:56)
epilogue um so that was nice yeah I so (42:52 - 42:58)
I'm not I mean everyone knows I don't (42:56 - 43:01)
like to read in video games but um I (42:58 - 43:04)
think it felt like a good amount even (43:01 - 43:06)
though there was a lot of it because it (43:04 - 43:10)
was so short I think if the entirety of (43:06 - 43:13)
a 40-hour game was that I would not (43:10 - 43:17)
enjoy that but having like less than two (43:13 - 43:21)
hours of that I think it yeah it was fun (43:17 - 43:22)
because it was a fun story as well like (43:21 - 43:25)
I I I really enjoyed what it was doing (43:22 - 43:29)
um it was you know silliness and I love (43:25 - 43:33)
silliness yes it was way sillier than I (43:29 - 43:34)
was expecting it to be I was expecting (43:33 - 43:37)
to go in there and have it just be (43:34 - 43:40)
serious and and be about uh possession (43:37 - 43:44)
and influence and evil and and it was (43:40 - 43:48)
about some of that but it was not when (43:44 - 43:51)
Kieran gets donked in the head holy cow (43:48 - 43:53)
that was probably the best part of the (43:51 - 43:57)
whole thing I don't think anybody (43:53 - 43:59)
what who hadn't seen what was coming was (43:57 - 44:01)
expecting what it was I watched so many (43:59 - 44:04)
people just because it was so short you (44:01 - 44:05)
were able to go and watch so many people (44:04 - 44:07)
go and play through it and I watched so (44:05 - 44:11)
many people get to the part with um (44:07 - 44:14)
Carmine and either start dancing along (44:11 - 44:17)
with her or just go what what is (44:14 - 44:21)
happening what is happening right (44:17 - 44:24)
now yeah I think I think uh the one (44:21 - 44:28)
thing it does answer is that Kieran was (44:24 - 44:32)
never under an like influence I disagree (44:28 - 44:35)
oh okay okay okay go on I'm stru and I'm (44:32 - 44:37)
ready for this I am not convinced I (44:35 - 44:39)
don't think I don't think there is (44:37 - 44:42)
enough evidence (44:39 - 44:44)
uh what I really want to do is go (44:42 - 44:46)
through and play and listen for musical (44:44 - 44:47)
cues because that's the one thing that I (44:46 - 44:49)
think is going to convince me one way or (44:47 - 44:51)
the other but the reason I am not fully (44:49 - 44:54)
convinced that the theory that I have (44:51 - 44:57)
been following is wrong (44:54 - 45:00)
is because once again Scarlet has the (44:57 - 45:03)
better Dex entry for (45:00 - 45:07)
pedant and Scarlet's Dex entry for pant (45:03 - 45:10)
says that it draws that its toxic (45:07 - 45:13)
capabilities draw out desires and (45:10 - 45:16)
capabilities and that is exactly what (45:13 - 45:17)
happened to (45:16 - 45:21)
Kieran those words that is exactly what (45:17 - 45:25)
happened to Kieran I think the thing is (45:21 - 45:27)
we we (45:25 - 45:28)
every single person that we saw under (45:27 - 45:31)
the influence of pant was not acting (45:28 - 45:34)
like themselves at all though like we (45:31 - 45:35)
didn't see that happen they were they (45:34 - 45:39)
were all acting very similarly and in a (45:35 - 45:43)
non in inhuman kind of way loyal three (45:39 - 45:44)
don't (45:43 - 45:46)
though the loyal 3 don't do that their (45:44 - 45:48)
eyes don't glow they don't go saying (45:46 - 45:51)
mochi mochi all the time and even in the (45:48 - 45:57)
video that uh was released post epilog (45:51 - 46:00)
even though the old couple's eyes do (45:57 - 46:04)
glow they don't just act the same way as (46:00 - 46:06)
everyone did in the epilog dancing (46:04 - 46:09)
around and saying mochi mochi clearly (46:06 - 46:13)
petron's abilities affect individuals (46:09 - 46:16)
differently to different extents I mean (46:13 - 46:18)
it is it is a mythical Pokemon and when (46:16 - 46:20)
you have a mythical Pokemon like Hoopa (46:18 - 46:22)
being able to like open rings and then (46:20 - 46:24)
you have like celby that can time travel (46:22 - 46:26)
I can't imagine pet around his like I (46:24 - 46:29)
just throw Donuts at people which like (46:26 - 46:31)
is a great thing like when you hit (46:29 - 46:32)
Kieran in the head with a donut like (46:31 - 46:34)
that's awesome (46:32 - 46:36)
but I I totally see where Hannah is (46:34 - 46:38)
coming from is like there there must be (46:36 - 46:40)
more that it does like besides just (46:38 - 46:44)
being like toxic chain here some donuts (46:40 - 46:48)
now you dance like a chicken um the one (46:44 - 46:50)
other thing that convinced me because I (46:48 - 46:53)
was going and looking for looking for (46:50 - 46:55)
people breaking this down because I'm I (46:53 - 46:57)
I still really think that Kieran had at (46:55 - 46:59)
least a little bit of influence from (46:57 - 47:02)
petun maybe it wasn't the same degree (46:59 - 47:04)
but the piece of (47:02 - 47:06)
artwork from when they were announcing (47:04 - 47:10)
blueberry Academy that has all of the (47:06 - 47:13)
Elite 4 Club on one side and the player (47:10 - 47:15)
characters on the other side and Kieran (47:13 - 47:17)
and Carmine standing in the middle (47:15 - 47:19)
kieran's hand the one that he used to (47:17 - 47:23)
punch the Shrine of the loyal 3 is (47:19 - 47:25)
glowing purple just a little bit the (47:23 - 47:26)
same little purple glow (47:25 - 47:28)
that you get around all of the (47:26 - 47:31)
characters in The (47:28 - 47:31)
epilog so I'm still not convinced I (47:33 - 47:38)
think they just deliberately didn't (47:36 - 47:39)
answer (47:38 - 47:43)
it that that that's like not surprising (47:39 - 47:45)
in any way they also made a character (47:43 - 47:48)
that was 3,000 years old and 20 feet (47:45 - 47:49)
tall and they didn't answer anything (47:48 - 47:54)
about that man uh not not a lick they (47:49 - 47:55)
yeah it definitely answered as many (47:54 - 47:59)
questions as I I was expecting them to (47:55 - 48:03)
so yeah I mean like I (47:59 - 48:03)
think like I I think Pokemon games have (48:04 - 48:10)
always (48:07 - 48:12)
been like open to (48:10 - 48:15)
interpretation with some (48:12 - 48:18)
stuff for Better or For Worse like some (48:15 - 48:23)
people really like that some people (48:18 - 48:23)
don't but (48:25 - 48:32)
um I I think the the thing about the the (48:28 - 48:35)
epilog that stood out to me and I don't (48:32 - 48:37)
know why I don't know why I have this (48:35 - 48:40)
feeling but you you battle like two no (48:37 - 48:43)
buies right away they're just like (48:40 - 48:45)
random and I can't even remember what (48:43 - 48:48)
Pokemon they use and it's like it it's (48:45 - 48:50)
it's not a double it is a double battle (48:48 - 48:52)
but it's technically a multi battle (48:50 - 48:54)
because you can't control what your the (48:52 - 48:57)
opponent's your what whatever's doing I (48:54 - 48:58)
kind I should have in retrospect I (48:57 - 49:00)
should have knocked out kieran's Pokemon (48:58 - 49:03)
cuz I after his poly he I want to see (49:00 - 49:05)
his whole team he brings out hydrael and (49:03 - 49:07)
I never saw what came after hydrael so (49:05 - 49:09)
the first interesting thing there is he (49:07 - 49:12)
has Poliwrath again and I think I talked (49:09 - 49:14)
about this with the battle with Kieran (49:12 - 49:17)
where he has a poly toad which the (49:14 - 49:19)
interesting thing is like yeah it's (49:17 - 49:21)
still the poly line but you you have to (49:19 - 49:23)
like start over so he started over and (49:21 - 49:26)
got a poly toad which like people change (49:23 - 49:27)
their (49:26 - 49:30)
teams you know like hop Chang his team (49:27 - 49:32)
like all that stuff so the fact that he (49:30 - 49:34)
like stuck with the polyline but went (49:32 - 49:36)
towed instead of Wrath I was like oh (49:34 - 49:37)
like that's a noticeable change in your (49:36 - 49:39)
team composition and then in this (49:37 - 49:42)
instance he went back to wrath which I (49:39 - 49:44)
think is even more (49:42 - 49:48)
interesting because like wrath fit his (49:44 - 49:53)
old personality or his like stuck up um (49:48 - 49:55)
going to be vengeful personality and (49:53 - 49:57)
like (49:55 - 50:01)
switching to toad was more of (49:57 - 50:04)
like like he was still that angry edgy (50:01 - 50:07)
boy but like toad made more sense (50:04 - 50:11)
competitively to like fit his whole (50:07 - 50:14)
team and so like he went going back (50:11 - 50:16)
maybe I'm overthinking but going back to (50:14 - 50:18)
wrath was (50:16 - 50:18)
like what why is this your lead Pokemon (50:18 - 50:23)
for all of these (50:22 - 50:26)
battles I guess the way I saw was that (50:23 - 50:28)
he was going back to the Pokemon he (50:26 - 50:30)
wanted to use instead of the Pokemon (50:28 - 50:33)
that were the best for his team (50:30 - 50:33)
composition I mean wrath you have (50:36 - 50:41)
incinerar right there man like that's (50:38 - 50:44)
use that that's a cool (50:41 - 50:46)
Pokemon I couldn't find any place and (50:44 - 50:48)
maybe I just didn't look hard enough I (50:46 - 50:50)
wanted to try and find what his entire (50:48 - 50:52)
team had been because I also wanted to (50:50 - 50:55)
check but yeah it's up it's up on bedia (50:52 - 50:57)
now um interestingly he does have for (50:55 - 51:01)
the first (50:57 - 51:01)
uh he has he has all six he can choose (51:02 - 51:07)
from all six Pokemon he doesn't just (51:05 - 51:08)
have three which is interesting so I (51:07 - 51:11)
guess he there's probably some AI logic (51:08 - 51:13)
behind you know how he chooses which (51:11 - 51:15)
Pokemon based on what's out there and (51:13 - 51:18)
what you have (51:15 - 51:22)
um but it's poth Dragonite Porygon Z (51:18 - 51:24)
Grim snarl incur and (51:22 - 51:28)
hydrael heally just the same team with (51:24 - 51:28)
different (51:28 - 51:31)
Polly (51:28 - 51:31)
yeah me and Hanah are just like Steve (51:38 - 51:42)
you're the one that reads into the (51:41 - 51:45)
battles yeah no I I haven't had time to (51:42 - 51:48)
like go through uh his his team like I (51:45 - 51:51)
did the the first time um but like that (51:48 - 51:53)
first battle I was just (51:51 - 51:55)
like the most interesting thing here is (51:53 - 51:57)
the PO wrath I don't why am I battling (51:55 - 51:59)
these NPC people how many of these like (51:57 - 52:01)
battles do I have to do to get back up (51:59 - 52:04)
to the shrine and then the second battle (52:01 - 52:08)
was against kieran's grandparents right (52:04 - 52:11)
like I think they're his grandparents y (52:08 - 52:15)
um and that was significantly more (52:11 - 52:19)
interesting and fun to like run like to (52:15 - 52:21)
me at least and that's why (52:19 - 52:24)
like I I I'm thinking about this in a (52:21 - 52:26)
way of like I get to that first battle (52:24 - 52:28)
I'm like oh my gosh okay here we go let (52:26 - 52:29)
me (52:28 - 52:32)
like I'm just going to use level 100s (52:29 - 52:34)
because like even if I brought what like (52:32 - 52:36)
they were like what level 82 or (52:34 - 52:37)
something I was like even if I brought (52:36 - 52:39)
like a level 82 Pokemon there's like (52:37 - 52:41)
zero challenge here like they're not (52:39 - 52:43)
going to be that difficult and then I (52:41 - 52:45)
get to the grandparents and I'm like oh (52:43 - 52:46)
am I going to battle kieran's (52:45 - 52:48)
grandparents that's kind of crazy and (52:46 - 52:49)
then like the battle was like starting I (52:48 - 52:51)
was like oh Grandma and Grandpa are (52:49 - 52:53)
battling that that's cool and (52:51 - 52:56)
then I think the interesting thing was (52:53 - 52:59)
like the grandpa has Arbok (52:56 - 53:02)
and and wheezing and you're like okay (52:59 - 53:03)
like that that's that's not a (53:02 - 53:05)
coincidence that like you have arbach (53:03 - 53:06)
and wheezing right like that's just like (53:05 - 53:09)
a very like like it doesn't like mean (53:06 - 53:12)
anything but at the same time it's like (53:09 - 53:15)
we all know that arbach and weezing come (53:12 - 53:18)
together and then the grandma has like (53:15 - 53:20)
Chandelier and something else and I was (53:18 - 53:23)
like oh man I wish this made more sense (53:20 - 53:25)
maybe it's just a chandelier and I don't (53:23 - 53:28)
remember her other Pok√©mon but even (53:25 - 53:33)
though it was like as easy as the first (53:28 - 53:36)
battle I think it was just more fun to (53:33 - 53:38)
do because they were characters that we (53:36 - 53:41)
were familiarized ourselves with and to (53:38 - 53:44)
see them have Pokemon (53:41 - 53:46)
like I feel like this is not talked (53:44 - 53:49)
about enough but like (53:46 - 53:53)
when you apply Pokemon to a trainer (53:49 - 53:54)
you're (53:53 - 53:58)
applying more characteristics to (53:54 - 54:01)
them like you you like it you just know (53:58 - 54:02)
more about them like when when I tell (54:01 - 54:04)
people like my favorite Pokemon are like (54:02 - 54:07)
oh I really like karant and I like (54:04 - 54:10)
golden go and I like uh Swadloon they're (54:07 - 54:12)
like oh you like a bunch of derpy po (54:10 - 54:14)
yeah I (54:12 - 54:17)
do I feel like you you just you learn so (54:14 - 54:19)
much about a (54:17 - 54:22)
character when you see like the Pokemon (54:19 - 54:24)
they use in a Pokemon game but yeah (54:22 - 54:25)
obviously you can also apply that to (54:24 - 54:26)
like (54:25 - 54:28)
IA real life people and like the Pokemon (54:26 - 54:31)
they pick oh yeah a person's choice in (54:28 - 54:33)
Pokemon definitely tells you a bunch (54:31 - 54:35)
about them but I think I think with each (54:33 - 54:38)
of the battles they kind of stepped up (54:35 - 54:41)
the situation and it was all part of the (54:38 - 54:45)
story it was uh oh no the town is (54:41 - 54:47)
possessed oh no kieran's grandparents (54:45 - 54:51)
are possessed oh no Arvin and and Penny (54:47 - 54:53)
are possessed and just with each level (54:51 - 54:55)
this just keeps getting into more and (54:53 - 54:57)
more more of a (54:55 - 55:00)
situation and it was fun and I'm I'm (54:57 - 55:04)
someone who hates zombie stories this (55:00 - 55:05)
was kind of like that but it wasn't (55:04 - 55:09)
enough like that that it put me off of (55:05 - 55:12)
it the thing that I really (55:09 - 55:15)
liked was how even though they're all (55:12 - 55:16)
doing the same thing right they're all (55:15 - 55:20)
doing the you know your chicken actions (55:16 - 55:24)
they're all subtly different animations (55:20 - 55:26)
that have something I just in in in (55:24 - 55:27)
terms of like we're talking about (55:26 - 55:29)
personality here right they're they're (55:27 - 55:31)
all like if you so when you're when (55:29 - 55:33)
you're about to battle Arvin and Penny (55:31 - 55:35)
you get the option of talking about one (55:33 - 55:38)
of them um and I can't remember what it (55:35 - 55:40)
was when with Penny but something about (55:38 - 55:42)
her being over enthusiastic or something (55:40 - 55:44)
like that I think um but if you talk (55:42 - 55:47)
about Arvin Kieran says oh does he look (55:44 - 55:50)
a little embarrassed to you I think (55:47 - 55:51)
that's a I think that's a default line (55:50 - 55:53)
it's one of my favorite lines in the (55:51 - 55:57)
entire epilog it's it's very funny to me (55:53 - 56:01)
um AR's dancing is the most different (55:57 - 56:02)
but the main characters are the ones who (56:01 - 56:04)
have the slightly different dancers I (56:02 - 56:05)
think all of the background characters (56:04 - 56:07)
are all kind of the same oh well I (56:05 - 56:08)
wasn't really paying attention to them (56:07 - 56:11)
Arvin Arvin is hesitant and embarrassed (56:08 - 56:13)
and and stuttering over the whole thing (56:11 - 56:15)
the way I was telling people was that if (56:13 - 56:16)
I tried to do that I would look like (56:15 - 56:20)
Arvin Penny was really into it so much (56:16 - 56:22)
so (56:20 - 56:22)
yeah before you even get to like the (56:24 - 56:29)
dancing stuff you have the like all of (56:26 - 56:32)
them coming together and you have the (56:29 - 56:35)
like I remember the call of like come (56:32 - 56:37)
come back home and I'm like oh I have a (56:35 - 56:39)
house I forgot I haven't been there in (56:37 - 56:41)
like 900 (56:39 - 56:43)
hours yeah they showed it at different (56:41 - 56:46)
angles than you can ever play it in (56:43 - 56:48)
actual in game because you can't move (56:46 - 56:49)
your camera around in that house but (56:48 - 56:51)
when you're in the cut scenes you can (56:49 - 56:52)
actually see different angles of the (56:51 - 56:54)
house so they (56:52 - 56:56)
exist (56:54 - 57:01)
um and I thought like I thought overall (56:56 - 57:04)
like the dialogue was was good like it (57:01 - 57:06)
it (57:04 - 57:06)
made like I don't expect like (57:06 - 57:12)
award-winning dialogue for most games (57:10 - 57:14)
let alone a Pokemon game but like I felt (57:12 - 57:19)
like How It Was Written didn't feel out (57:14 - 57:21)
of place (57:19 - 57:25)
or like it like it wasn't it wasn't like (57:21 - 57:26)
again super interesting or it wasn't (57:25 - 57:29)
even like super memorable some of the (57:26 - 57:31)
stuff they said but like when you were (57:29 - 57:33)
reading it it was just like oh yeah that (57:31 - 57:35)
like this makes sense coming from Arvin (57:33 - 57:39)
this makes sense coming from Penny um it (57:35 - 57:41)
like it did it it also felt (57:39 - 57:46)
like a game written in 2023 and I don't (57:41 - 57:48)
know if I'm explaining that right versus (57:46 - 57:51)
like yeah this dialogue makes sense like (57:48 - 57:54)
if we lived in like (57:51 - 57:59)
2006 like it like it did feel I see like (57:54 - 58:02)
modern dialogue which again is something (57:59 - 58:04)
I really don't expect from a Pokemon (58:02 - 58:08)
like game like I always feel like that's (58:04 - 58:12)
like two three four years behind in like (58:08 - 58:15)
current trends but it did (58:12 - 58:18)
feel up to dat if again if that makes (58:15 - 58:20)
any sense yeah the the language that (58:18 - 58:24)
they used was definitely uh modern and (58:20 - 58:25)
kind of filled with a little bit of (58:24 - 58:27)
modern slang but that was in The Scarlet (58:25 - 58:31)
and violet main game too I'm pretty sure (58:27 - 58:34)
uh director Cel asks you what Choi means (58:31 - 58:37)
that was a little outdated (58:34 - 58:40)
but they've they've tried to keep it up (58:37 - 58:42)
a little bit a little bit outdated but (58:40 - 58:44)
it makes sense for somebody who's only (58:42 - 58:46)
just realizing that this word is a thing (58:44 - 58:48)
and yeah the kids have already moved (58:46 - 58:51)
away from it but he doesn't realize that (58:48 - 58:55)
I think it was a sorry a lot of the (58:51 - 58:58)
dialogue felt I cringed at a lot of it (58:55 - 59:00)
but not because it didn't feel realistic (58:58 - 59:03)
but just because that is exactly how I (59:00 - 59:05)
feel this conversation with these (59:03 - 59:08)
awkward people would end up going when (59:05 - 59:09)
they're meeting each other for the first (59:08 - 59:12)
time and (59:09 - 59:17)
yeah yeah I mean I enjoyed so much of it (59:12 - 59:19)
I was a little bit weirded out a little (59:17 - 59:23)
bit put off by how protective Arvin was (59:19 - 59:26)
and like almost jealous of Kieran that (59:23 - 59:28)
was a little bit surprising but not too (59:26 - 59:31)
surprising once you think about how few (59:28 - 59:33)
friends he seems to have had in his (59:31 - 59:36)
lifetime and that kind of thing uh I (59:33 - 59:37)
don't know I felt like all of the (59:36 - 59:40)
dialogue was so good I read all of it (59:37 - 59:44)
out loud so every line felt like there (59:40 - 59:46)
was there was even that I mean yeah (59:44 - 59:47)
there was the little mini story of Arvin (59:46 - 59:49)
being jealous of Kieran and then kind of (59:47 - 59:51)
getting over that and realizing that (59:49 - 59:54)
okay we're all now friends and there was (59:51 - 59:57)
the meeting scene between Kieran and (59:54 - 60:01)
neona which everybody I lots of people (59:57 - 60:03)
had been looking forward to because (60:01 - 60:05)
neona is way too much for (60:03 - 60:07)
Kieran oh that's the worst part about (60:05 - 60:10)
the epilogue I wanted to see that battle (60:07 - 60:12)
I am so mad that they were like we're (60:10 - 60:14)
going to have Kieran and neona b battle (60:12 - 60:17)
and we're not going to show it like what (60:14 - 60:18)
like did they single battle did they (60:17 - 60:21)
double battle why did Kieran lose what (60:18 - 60:22)
Pokemon did she use what Pokemon did he (60:21 - 60:26)
use like I that's the whole epilog's bad (60:22 - 60:27)
I want to just see the battle just give (60:26 - 60:29)
me the battle that's all that's all I (60:27 - 60:32)
wanted like that that is like the (60:29 - 60:35)
most frustrating thing as a Pokemon fan (60:32 - 60:38)
whether that's like ingame lore of like (60:35 - 60:40)
these two car they do this in Masters (60:38 - 60:42)
all the time where they're like we're (60:40 - 60:43)
gonna have these two characters are (60:42 - 60:44)
finally going to meet they're going to (60:43 - 60:46)
like dish out their things and then (60:44 - 60:47)
something happens and then like you (60:46 - 60:49)
never see that in Masters which like I (60:47 - 60:52)
Mak sense I guess uh also different type (60:49 - 60:54)
of battling technically in Masters but (60:52 - 60:57)
like even in the anime where you're like (60:54 - 61:00)
watching a genuinely good battle between (60:57 - 61:02)
like Ash and a gym leader and then Team (61:00 - 61:05)
Rocket comes in and then it's like the (61:02 - 61:07)
battle's on hold and you're like no I (61:05 - 61:11)
don't care about this I want to see the (61:07 - 61:14)
battle like it's so frustrating yeah (61:11 - 61:16)
they even did that with with the like (61:14 - 61:20)
the world championship final two years (61:16 - 61:21)
ago whenever it was actually ended up (61:20 - 61:23)
happening it's like that gets (61:21 - 61:25)
interrupted as well it's like they they (61:23 - 61:28)
can't stop interrupting battles in the (61:25 - 61:31)
anime this is we care about this we want (61:28 - 61:33)
to see this through yeah I I also think (61:31 - 61:35)
we're unlikely to see this battle in the (61:33 - 61:39)
anime because I think with the last (61:35 - 61:41)
couple of series they've been less (61:39 - 61:45)
focusing on the game characters in the (61:41 - 61:48)
anime like with Journeys it was you know (61:45 - 61:50)
the game characters they exist in the (61:48 - 61:54)
world and in kind of like earlier games (61:50 - 61:56)
H she was quite often and you know (61:54 - 61:58)
friends with them and I feel like with (61:56 - 61:59)
kind of sun and moon is when they (61:58 - 62:02)
started like those friends the the group (61:59 - 62:04)
of five or whatever they were they (62:02 - 62:06)
existed but we only saw them a few times (62:04 - 62:08)
and then it's got to this point where I (62:06 - 62:11)
think we like 18 episodes in or no 20 20 (62:08 - 62:13)
something episodes in and we've seen (62:11 - 62:19)
neona once um so it's yeah sorry (62:13 - 62:21)
spoiler it would be nice to watch if (62:19 - 62:23)
only it wasn't delayed until March 7th (62:21 - 62:25)
or whatever um (62:23 - 62:27)
so yeah I it just feels like they're and (62:25 - 62:29)
and that's that's fine you know but it (62:27 - 62:30)
does mean that I think we're very (62:29 - 62:32)
unlikely to get see a battle between (62:30 - 62:34)
these two and the enemy that confuses me (62:32 - 62:36)
a bit I've been kind of hoping that some (62:34 - 62:37)
of the questions that weren't answered (62:36 - 62:39)
in in scarlet and violet the games would (62:37 - 62:42)
maybe be answered in the anime because (62:39 - 62:45)
I'd seen tragos is in there and neona in (62:42 - 62:48)
there but sounds like May the second (62:45 - 62:50)
year like usually the first year is (62:48 - 62:53)
still building that World um they had to (62:50 - 62:55)
have single battle right like there's no (62:53 - 62:58)
way kieran's B I'm I'm still thinking (62:55 - 63:00)
about this kieran's team is so double (62:58 - 63:02)
battled focused and he has such a hard (63:00 - 63:06)
strategy and nimona is not she she does (63:02 - 63:10)
she has a very single focused team well (63:06 - 63:11)
you know the conversation would go (63:10 - 63:13)
Kieran says oh should we do double (63:11 - 63:14)
battles and neona says no single battles (63:13 - 63:17)
and he goes okay and just lets it happen (63:14 - 63:18)
I (63:17 - 63:21)
mean that's probably actually how it (63:18 - 63:24)
went it did Bo it bothered me a lot that (63:21 - 63:26)
he lost (63:24 - 63:26)
like like he like he you were the only (63:26 - 63:33)
one to defeat him and nimona I I mean (63:29 - 63:36)
like you defeated neona too but neona (63:33 - 63:39)
has lost in other situations as well (63:36 - 63:41)
yeah and I I get the disappointment (63:39 - 63:42)
there but I think that the interaction (63:41 - 63:44)
that came out of it between Kieran and (63:42 - 63:47)
neona where Kieran goes yeah it was good (63:44 - 63:50)
but I lost and neona says that's okay (63:47 - 63:54)
it's okay to lose we're having fun was (63:50 - 63:56)
something that Kier needed yeah yeah I (63:54 - 64:00)
mean like yes story and development like (63:56 - 64:03)
I I get it also it had to be it had to (64:00 - 64:05)
be single battle there's no way he would (64:03 - 64:07)
have lost (64:05 - 64:11)
double um man has he could just be bad (64:07 - 64:14)
now that he's not you know possessed by (64:11 - 64:17)
pant anymore maybe pant had I still (64:14 - 64:18)
don't think possessed was the right word (64:17 - 64:21)
but (64:18 - 64:21)
influenced you know semantics (64:22 - 64:26)
[Laughter] (64:24 - 64:29)
I have semantics for later uh uh for for (64:26 - 64:32)
the record uh the the thing (64:29 - 64:35)
that with when the teal mask came out (64:32 - 64:36)
and I do not want to spend a lot of time (64:35 - 64:38)
on this but there there were people that (64:36 - 64:41)
were upset that like you as a player (64:38 - 64:44)
character lies to Kieran right like that (64:41 - 64:46)
that was a point of contention for a lot (64:44 - 64:49)
of people I get it um but I also get (64:46 - 64:51)
that that's the story they're telling of (64:49 - 64:54)
like we want this boy to be lied to so (64:51 - 64:57)
he feels like he was (64:54 - 64:59)
upset I have that feeling with like (64:57 - 65:02)
Arvin in general which is like totally (64:59 - 65:06)
like not as serious as that but like the (65:02 - 65:09)
constant like Arvin being like Oh man (65:06 - 65:11)
we're best friends we've been friends (65:09 - 65:13)
where you can't be his friend because (65:11 - 65:14)
I'm his (65:13 - 65:18)
friend I I never felt that way with (65:14 - 65:21)
Arvin I just like and they just put it (65:18 - 65:25)
on you so heavy throughout that epil (65:21 - 65:26)
and like I get it cuz that's the story (65:25 - 65:30)
they're trying to tell but (65:26 - 65:32)
like nowhere did I feel that connection (65:30 - 65:34)
with Arvin like I felt bad for his dog I (65:32 - 65:36)
totally got the story you're telling of (65:34 - 65:39)
like save his dog I 100% kind of sucks (65:36 - 65:42)
that you're parent is missing and (65:39 - 65:44)
teleported back and talked to you but (65:42 - 65:48)
not him like I understand all of that (65:44 - 65:50)
but like I never had a connection with (65:48 - 65:53)
Arvin so all of that stuff of like (65:50 - 65:56)
jealousy and oh my gosh your mom is the (65:53 - 65:59)
best and we're friends forever just like (65:56 - 66:02)
bounced right off me and I was just I (65:59 - 66:06)
I and I say like the like people didn't (66:02 - 66:08)
like lying to (66:06 - 66:10)
Kieran because I and I think a lot of (66:08 - 66:14)
that is like you don't have control and (66:10 - 66:16)
I don't have control over that part of (66:14 - 66:19)
the story of like Arvin being buddy (66:16 - 66:23)
buddy and I wish there was again I wish (66:19 - 66:26)
the questions you answer in that game of (66:23 - 66:28)
like do you want to be a strong trainer (66:26 - 66:30)
do you want to be a collector do you (66:28 - 66:31)
want this do you want that do you want (66:30 - 66:33)
ham do you want sashes none of that (66:31 - 66:35)
stuff (66:33 - 66:40)
matters and yeah I wish it did because (66:35 - 66:43)
like when you got to like these parts of (66:40 - 66:44)
the game whether it's lying or whether (66:43 - 66:45)
it's buddy buddy or whether you had to (66:44 - 66:49)
do this you have to do it because that's (66:45 - 66:51)
the story they're telling at the end of (66:49 - 66:55)
the day and that's unfortunate like (66:51 - 66:56)
like I mean that's that's the difference (66:55 - 66:58)
between games and and other media right (66:56 - 67:00)
other media you expect to be told this (66:58 - 67:02)
story games you expect to have some kind (67:00 - 67:05)
of influence on that um I will say I (67:02 - 67:08)
kind of I do agree with you however I (67:05 - 67:10)
think if I was in that situation that my (67:08 - 67:11)
player character was in where Arvin was (67:10 - 67:14)
being like that my player character did (67:11 - 67:17)
exactly what I would do which is nothing (67:14 - 67:19)
don't mention it don't refer to it right (67:17 - 67:22)
this is an incredibly awkward situation (67:19 - 67:24)
I hate this but I am not going to tell (67:22 - 67:28)
you that we're not friends right (67:24 - 67:28)
like I think goodness gracious y'all (67:28 - 67:33)
don't read (67:31 - 67:35)
enough you don't read enough of the (67:33 - 67:39)
dialogue um so most of arvin's (67:35 - 67:42)
friendship comes after the way out it (67:39 - 67:44)
comes as you all are coming back up from (67:42 - 67:47)
Aro zero it comes in the (67:44 - 67:50)
dialogue that you are talking to Arvin (67:47 - 67:52)
in the library and in his dorm room (67:50 - 67:54)
after all of this and so that's where (67:52 - 67:57)
most of the the feelings of Friendship (67:54 - 67:59)
with Arvin come from along with having (67:57 - 68:03)
helped him and his and his dog uh but (67:59 - 68:05)
also I know that other people have felt (68:03 - 68:08)
the same way you feel Steve about pona (68:05 - 68:10)
which is wild to me because I love pona (68:08 - 68:12)
but I have absolutely seen people hate (68:10 - 68:15)
her still and they hate having to (68:12 - 68:16)
interact with her like that in this game (68:15 - 68:18)
and so yeah (68:16 - 68:21)
it's I don't know it's it really is just (68:18 - 68:23)
the story that they they have decided to (68:21 - 68:25)
tell (68:23 - 68:27)
I I will say there is a bit of a problem (68:25 - 68:29)
I feel in having so much character (68:27 - 68:32)
development in the little bits and (68:29 - 68:36)
pieces after the main story only in the (68:32 - 68:38)
sense that we then continue that story I (68:36 - 68:42)
think if it were there was no DLC there (68:38 - 68:45)
was no extra thing and you just had the (68:42 - 68:48)
bits with Arvin in and amongst the (68:45 - 68:51)
school and that kind of gave you more of (68:48 - 68:54)
that relationship and of his personality (68:51 - 68:55)
the problem then is that you don't need (68:54 - 68:58)
to do any of that you can easily ignore (68:55 - 69:00)
all of that and then you just jump (68:58 - 69:02)
straight in with two feet into this (69:00 - 69:05)
point here I think the strongest bit is (69:02 - 69:07)
as you're coming out of area zero the (69:05 - 69:09)
little part before the credits start (69:07 - 69:11)
that's really the strongest thing tying (69:09 - 69:14)
you to Irvin and you can't skip that no (69:11 - 69:16)
I know and that that felt awkward to me (69:14 - 69:18)
I I didn't like I wasn't a huge fan of (69:16 - 69:20)
that because that felt just like oh (69:18 - 69:21)
we've just like because we did we not we (69:20 - 69:23)
I think we I feel like we talked about (69:21 - 69:24)
that where it was like (69:23 - 69:26)
he's just found out that his parents (69:24 - 69:28)
died and then we get out and we've not (69:26 - 69:30)
talked about that and then suddenly he's (69:28 - 69:33)
like we're best friends that felt weird (69:30 - 69:35)
as well like I can't remember exactly (69:33 - 69:37)
what it was he said it's been too long (69:35 - 69:38)
and I'm not playing through the game a (69:37 - 69:41)
fifth time um to remind myself yeah I (69:38 - 69:44)
gosh I I remember that part too being (69:41 - 69:46)
like man you just found out your parents (69:44 - 69:48)
died and we've kind of moved on but then (69:46 - 69:51)
I think they do come back to it at a (69:48 - 69:53)
certain point for a second or so they (69:51 - 69:55)
come back back to it a couple of times (69:53 - 69:57)
and they definitely hint to it in the in (69:55 - 69:59)
the dialogue in this epilog but as the (69:57 - 70:01)
credits are starting to roll I think (69:59 - 70:03)
Arvin just wants to fly home or go home (70:01 - 70:05)
real quick or something like that and (70:03 - 70:08)
Penny and Noona and your character all (70:05 - 70:12)
go over to support him (70:08 - 70:12)
yeah it's yeah I'm not saying this stuff (70:12 - 70:18)
St trying to tell it just feels awkward (70:15 - 70:19)
when you've got that bit that is (70:18 - 70:21)
completely that stuff that's completely (70:19 - 70:24)
optional that one point one tiny bit at (70:21 - 70:26)
the end of the main story aside right (70:24 - 70:27)
you've got all this optional stuff that (70:26 - 70:29)
then rely on to make you feel stuff in (70:27 - 70:32)
the DLC just feels a little bit weird (70:29 - 70:33)
yeah and we're not talking about any of (70:32 - 70:35)
the interactions in the club room which (70:33 - 70:37)
adds more to all of these character (70:35 - 70:39)
stories I haven't even started any of (70:37 - 70:41)
them yet I've been so distracted with (70:39 - 70:42)
other things in the (70:41 - 70:45)
game um so the other thing I wanted to (70:42 - 70:49)
bring up uh is comparing this to like (70:45 - 70:52)
other events uh I think the biggest one (70:49 - 70:54)
is probably the Victini event uh in (70:52 - 70:57)
black and white any ever since then ever (70:54 - 71:00)
since black and white (70:57 - 71:02)
people are like they they just give us (71:00 - 71:04)
mythical through GameStop which is true (71:02 - 71:07)
that is the like there's technically (71:04 - 71:09)
you're right you you want uh you want (71:07 - 71:12)
this mythical go to GameStop I they did (71:09 - 71:15)
you know do the the shiny zeraora (71:12 - 71:17)
through doing raid battles in Isle of (71:15 - 71:19)
armor and I thought that was a really (71:17 - 71:23)
cool way to give out a mythical in my (71:19 - 71:25)
opinion (71:23 - 71:27)
I remember my entire experience of the (71:25 - 71:31)
black and white I remember going to Mall (71:27 - 71:34)
of America when 15 years ago or however (71:31 - 71:38)
13 years ago and getting my game and (71:34 - 71:42)
sitting in the mall and playing the game (71:38 - 71:44)
and then going back to the mall the next (71:42 - 71:46)
day to because that was like my first (71:44 - 71:48)
time ever at Mall of America if you've (71:46 - 71:50)
never been to mall America it's very big (71:48 - 71:52)
for somebody who is your first time (71:50 - 71:55)
there and also I was like 20 years old (71:52 - 71:57)
and then I remember sitting in like the (71:55 - 71:59)
noodles in company which I think is (71:57 - 72:00)
still there (71:59 - 72:03)
today um and Redeeming the Victini thing (72:00 - 72:05)
and then doing it because you you you (72:03 - 72:06)
only had to get like what two three (72:05 - 72:09)
hours into the game to get the (72:06 - 72:12)
Victini and it didn't like it was cool (72:09 - 72:15)
to get Victini but I I don't remember (72:12 - 72:16)
that event being that like special right (72:15 - 72:18)
like you get to castelia you take the (72:16 - 72:21)
little boat over it's on Victory Island (72:18 - 72:22)
I think it's called Victory Island I (72:21 - 72:24)
think there's a couple (72:22 - 72:26)
uh Team Plasma grunts you fight and then (72:24 - 72:30)
you catch Victini and that's it but that (72:26 - 72:32)
fluff or whatever you want to call it is (72:30 - 72:34)
very memorable to a lot of people more (72:32 - 72:37)
so than just going to GameStop and doing (72:34 - 72:40)
it (72:37 - 72:42)
um (72:40 - 72:44)
I don't know if I want like every (72:42 - 72:46)
mythical Pokemon given to me like (72:44 - 72:48)
Victini or (72:46 - 72:51)
petun uh Petra run is obviously a lot (72:48 - 72:54)
more dialogue and I te I think (72:51 - 72:57)
technically more things to do although I (72:54 - 72:58)
get the complaint of like I don't want (72:57 - 73:00)
to just give like I don't want to walk (72:58 - 73:02)
into GameStop for my mythical experience (73:00 - 73:04)
I get that as well I think the thing (73:02 - 73:08)
that I really liked was CIO in aisle of (73:04 - 73:12)
armor I liked that it wasn't really (73:08 - 73:14)
battles it was just catch Pokemon so it (73:12 - 73:16)
was like find these tracks okay you (73:14 - 73:18)
found the tracks Now Catch these Pokemon (73:16 - 73:20)
okay now take these Pokemon here and now (73:18 - 73:23)
you get CIO I think that was way more (73:20 - 73:26)
interesting and fit how I would want to (73:23 - 73:29)
experience that um but I don't know (73:26 - 73:31)
maybe I'm in the minority with that I (73:29 - 73:33)
think there's going to be people on all (73:31 - 73:35)
sides of this right so like it's going (73:33 - 73:36)
to be the classic thing where people are (73:35 - 73:38)
like oh you complain when there's no (73:36 - 73:40)
story you complain when there's story (73:38 - 73:42)
and just just to remind people listening (73:40 - 73:43)
those are two groups of people two (73:42 - 73:45)
different groups of people right those (73:43 - 73:49)
people both exist um I think I would (73:45 - 73:50)
agree with you that I wouldn't want this (73:49 - 73:53)
for every mythical if we were back at (73:50 - 73:57)
gen four with six different mythical (73:53 - 74:00)
Pok√©mon but we've had one this (73:57 - 74:02)
generation and I suspect we're not (74:00 - 74:03)
getting another one I think that that's (74:02 - 74:06)
it done right and we're and we only got (74:03 - 74:09)
one last generation we only got the one (74:06 - 74:11)
in gen 8 I think (74:09 - 74:14)
zerude yes zerude that was the one that (74:11 - 74:18)
was the name um so I think if it's one a (74:14 - 74:20)
generation I'm totally fine with this (74:18 - 74:22)
amount of work to get it I think it's (74:20 - 74:25)
it's a bit more fun than just getting (74:22 - 74:29)
that um I will say if you want to farm (74:25 - 74:31)
these that's going to be absolutely (74:29 - 74:33)
Dreadful to try and farm them which is (74:31 - 74:34)
probably one of the reasons why they've (74:33 - 74:37)
done it uh because because you have to (74:34 - 74:39)
play through the entire game and the (74:37 - 74:42)
entire DLC and then dialogue simulator (74:39 - 74:45)
to get it um I mean you could Farm Kio (74:42 - 74:48)
too it's just a night the same nightmare (74:45 - 74:53)
really yeah yeah yeah um and I do like (74:48 - 74:57)
how you can catch it in your own ball um (74:53 - 75:00)
as you do with Kio and with some ones (74:57 - 75:02)
but those have only been on release I (75:00 - 75:05)
don't know if we've have we had ones (75:02 - 75:07)
where you could catch the first time (75:05 - 75:09)
it's out in your own Pokeball I don't (75:07 - 75:15)
remember maybe I guess Crystal c c and (75:09 - 75:18)
Crystal yeah Mr you can catch Mr sarabe (75:15 - 75:21)
[Laughter] (75:18 - 75:25)
yes um so I I like that um I especially (75:21 - 75:28)
like that it was a raid style so you you (75:25 - 75:31)
defeat it and then you guaranteed catch (75:28 - 75:34)
yeah I do I I do like that really when (75:31 - 75:36)
when we come down to like catching (75:34 - 75:39)
Pokemon and I've said this since let's (75:36 - 75:42)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee catching (75:39 - 75:47)
Pokemon is so outdated and so unfun and (75:42 - 75:49)
that's why I liked let's go Pikachu (75:47 - 75:52)
let's go Eevee because like when you (75:49 - 75:54)
battled the legendary which are only (75:52 - 75:59)
four just zap M Articuno meww it made (75:54 - 76:02)
sense it made sense to defeat these (75:59 - 76:07)
Pokemon and then catch them like versus (76:02 - 76:11)
just throw Pokeballs and like people and (76:07 - 76:12)
I know the complaint of let's go Pikachu (76:11 - 76:14)
let's go Eevee was like I missed the old (76:12 - 76:17)
way of catching the old way of catching (76:14 - 76:19)
was just false swipe and sleep and throw (76:17 - 76:22)
a Pokeball there was maybe an exception (76:19 - 76:23)
where it was like a Geodude and you (76:22 - 76:25)
would have been like okay I'm going to (76:23 - 76:27)
soak it first then false swipe it then (76:25 - 76:29)
put it to sleep and throw a Pokeball and (76:27 - 76:32)
then at that point you're just chucking (76:29 - 76:36)
pokeballs until RNG says you got it and (76:32 - 76:37)
it's (76:36 - 76:40)
not like it's not great it's not fun (76:37 - 76:43)
like if you have very thick Nostalgia (76:40 - 76:45)
glasses if like well back well I grew up (76:43 - 76:47)
with this way yet we also grew up with (76:45 - 76:49)
newspapers we don't use those anymore (76:47 - 76:51)
like let's move on like we we've we've (76:49 - 76:55)
that ship has sailed games have changed (76:51 - 76:59)
like respect my time a little bit more (76:55 - 77:02)
and so like I liked let's go Pikachu (76:59 - 77:04)
let's go Eevee because it there was (77:02 - 77:05)
multiple ways to make it easier to catch (77:04 - 77:07)
heck you could just grab two pokeballs (77:05 - 77:09)
if you wanted to to catch I think (77:07 - 77:14)
defeating like Mewtwo first and then (77:09 - 77:17)
catching it felt more memorable of like (77:14 - 77:18)
oh I have this battle first and then (77:17 - 77:20)
once I defeat him I'm like worthy enough (77:18 - 77:23)
to catch it and I also think that's why (77:20 - 77:25)
people like Legends archus because I (77:23 - 77:27)
think it had a good mix of this new (77:25 - 77:29)
style of catching catching felt very (77:27 - 77:32)
fluid very fast um you could be (77:29 - 77:34)
strategic and how you like land and get (77:32 - 77:37)
behind it or you could just walk up to (77:34 - 77:39)
it and catch it the old fashioned way (77:37 - 77:40)
which was great it was great that they (77:39 - 77:42)
had both to all the people that are so (77:40 - 77:45)
like my Pokemon's changing you got the (77:42 - 77:48)
old way too uh so great (77:45 - 77:52)
perfect in in this (77:48 - 77:56)
instance I have zero desire to catch the (77:52 - 77:58)
25 legendary Pokemon they brought back (77:56 - 78:01)
not because they're shiny locked that (77:58 - 78:03)
doesn't really bother me because I (78:01 - 78:06)
already have all of them shiny anyways I (78:03 - 78:07)
I just don't want to sit there and throw (78:06 - 78:10)
pokeballs over and over it's just not (78:07 - 78:13)
interesting to me at all and there's (78:10 - 78:16)
there's nothing fun about that if all of (78:13 - 78:19)
those legendaries were set up like petun (78:16 - 78:22)
or like oky doggy or like feend diip (78:19 - 78:24)
well I guess technically you battle them (78:22 - 78:25)
the first time and then you catch them (78:24 - 78:28)
the second time but the the raid style (78:25 - 78:32)
battle that to me is like the solution (78:28 - 78:34)
to this I'm not saying like when you do (78:32 - 78:36)
a Pidgey it should be in a raid style (78:34 - 78:38)
battle to like catch the Pidgey but I (78:36 - 78:40)
think these legendary Pokemon should (78:38 - 78:43)
have like you shouldn't experience (78:40 - 78:46)
chenow for the first time and be like (78:43 - 78:48)
man chenow looks cool let me just keep (78:46 - 78:51)
chucking pokeballs till I catch it like (78:48 - 78:53)
don't you think like the first time you (78:51 - 78:55)
experience chenow you should maybe (78:53 - 78:58)
experience the power that is chenow and (78:55 - 79:01)
be like ah I defeated this legendary (78:58 - 79:04)
sword scoliosis cat who I absolutely (79:01 - 79:07)
love and now I get to catch it instead (79:04 - 79:09)
of like I'm just G to put it to sleep (79:07 - 79:10)
and cheuck (79:09 - 79:13)
Pok√©balls yeah I'm glad you brought up (79:10 - 79:15)
the let's go example because I I was the (79:13 - 79:18)
same I I loved how that worked I do (79:15 - 79:20)
actually think that it would be fine to (79:18 - 79:21)
have it for all Pok√©mon like it doesn't (79:20 - 79:24)
need to be in the the the same way like (79:21 - 79:25)
oh you've got the health bar bar at the (79:24 - 79:27)
top and it's like all dramatic like (79:25 - 79:29)
obviously you don't need that for the (79:27 - 79:31)
the lower level Pokemon but the idea of (79:29 - 79:32)
knock out the Pokemon and then get the (79:31 - 79:34)
chance to catch it I think could (79:32 - 79:36)
absolutely work for everything and I (79:34 - 79:39)
think that if you did that in let's go (79:36 - 79:42)
Pikachu and Eevee people would much less (79:39 - 79:44)
hate the catching they would have been (79:42 - 79:45)
much there still would have been an (79:44 - 79:47)
aspect of it because obviously you've (79:45 - 79:49)
got the motion controls but I think (79:47 - 79:50)
there would have been less complaints (79:49 - 79:52)
because they if you want to battle the (79:50 - 79:54)
Pokemon to get to grind your XP you can (79:52 - 79:57)
still do that I do find it really funny (79:54 - 80:02)
I this shows you how I played Legends I (79:57 - 80:04)
could I I honestly this conversation is (80:02 - 80:06)
the first time I knew you could catch (80:04 - 80:08)
normally Pokemon in that game I I (80:06 - 80:10)
legitimately didn't know that was a (80:08 - 80:13)
thing in Legends um I thought you had it (80:10 - 80:15)
was all throwing the pokeballs I didn't (80:13 - 80:17)
realize you could battle and then catch (80:15 - 80:20)
them like a TR Pokemon game I honestly (80:17 - 80:21)
did like cuz I wasn't getting into (80:20 - 80:23)
battle with any wild Pokemon I was (80:21 - 80:26)
avoiding every like I was just and I (80:23 - 80:27)
wasn't even like there was a few cases (80:26 - 80:28)
where I was like oh this is a rare (80:27 - 80:30)
Pokemon I need to go behind it and do (80:28 - 80:31)
blah blah blah but most of the time I (80:30 - 80:33)
was just like throwball throwball at (80:31 - 80:34)
everything I can see all the time I (80:33 - 80:37)
loved it it was fantastic yeah I think (80:34 - 80:39)
that a mix of the Legends style catching (80:37 - 80:42)
like that and the raid style catching (80:39 - 80:44)
just a little bit downgraded would be (80:42 - 80:47)
perfect just for every single Pokemon if (80:44 - 80:49)
you want to go into a battle and defeat (80:47 - 80:51)
the Pokemon and then have a choice of (80:49 - 80:53)
which Pokeball you get to use that's (80:51 - 80:54)
great if you want to just Chuck a (80:53 - 80:57)
Pokeball at it that's also great I think (80:54 - 80:59)
they probably need to to not allow you (80:57 - 81:01)
just to throw poke pokeballs at random (80:59 - 81:04)
mythicals though uh for the mythicals (81:01 - 81:06)
maybe just do the raids raid style but (81:04 - 81:08)
yeah I love the idea of just just coming (81:06 - 81:11)
in and just like I see a Mewtwo I'm (81:08 - 81:13)
throwing balls at (81:11 - 81:17)
it I remember previewing scarlet and (81:13 - 81:19)
violet early uh when like Nintendo (81:17 - 81:22)
brought me out no actually they did not (81:19 - 81:24)
I will full closure they did not pay for (81:22 - 81:26)
that first trip that I did to New York I (81:24 - 81:28)
paid for it they asked me if I wanted to (81:26 - 81:30)
come out but they couldn't compensate me (81:28 - 81:31)
and I was like I feel like playing a (81:30 - 81:33)
brand new generation early is a good use (81:31 - 81:37)
of my money um so I I paid my own way (81:33 - 81:40)
out there pop of Nintendo um but I (81:37 - 81:42)
remember playing it early right and then (81:40 - 81:46)
I remember talking about how like the um (81:42 - 81:49)
tralized wild Pokemon like you couldn't (81:46 - 81:51)
just catch them you had to like break (81:49 - 81:54)
their Shield first and then you could (81:51 - 81:58)
catch them which I think is like getting (81:54 - 82:01)
to what I I would prefer in a like (81:58 - 82:03)
similar to the Articuno Mewtwo and like (82:01 - 82:05)
let's go like you can't just the problem (82:03 - 82:08)
with that is they're just so useless to (82:05 - 82:10)
catch and that was my worry and I'm I'm (82:08 - 82:11)
almost positive I said this on the (82:10 - 82:14)
podcast of like I bet these Pokemon are (82:11 - 82:17)
not going to rotate or change or do and (82:14 - 82:19)
they don't and that's such a huge Miss (82:17 - 82:23)
in that game that like that ice floats (82:19 - 82:24)
that you probably find for the first (82:23 - 82:27)
time right outside of um oh gosh I can't (82:24 - 82:29)
remember any of the cities in scarland (82:27 - 82:33)
Violet uh the bug City where Katie is (82:29 - 82:35)
there's like a ice floatzel that you (82:33 - 82:37)
might find for the first time 14 months (82:35 - 82:41)
later still an ice floatzel there like (82:37 - 82:42)
no one is encountering that because (82:41 - 82:44)
there's no need to encounter it because (82:42 - 82:46)
like in what Universe do you need an ice (82:44 - 82:48)
floatzel after playing this game for 900 (82:46 - 82:50)
hours you just don't and so that was (82:48 - 82:52)
like I think a huge Miss of like you (82:50 - 82:53)
have these (82:52 - 82:56)
terized Pokemon around the map and you (82:53 - 82:58)
have to like actually battle them and (82:56 - 83:00)
break their Shield to in order to catch (82:58 - 83:02)
them but they don't rotate they don't (83:00 - 83:05)
change they don't and it just felt like (83:02 - 83:06)
that was like one of the things you (83:05 - 83:08)
could have done with outbreaks changing (83:06 - 83:09)
every day is these Pokemon could have (83:08 - 83:13)
changed and yeah I don't know it it's (83:09 - 83:15)
bum I I agree because I I I remember you (83:13 - 83:17)
saying that and I was like there's no (83:15 - 83:19)
way that they'll be the same there's no (83:17 - 83:21)
way that it will just be the exact same (83:19 - 83:24)
Pokemon in the same spot time um I I (83:21 - 83:26)
think the interesting thing is they (83:24 - 83:29)
didn't I was expecting it to be any (83:26 - 83:31)
Pokemon can spawn at these locations (83:29 - 83:33)
with a random terot type and you're just (83:31 - 83:35)
you just have you know and it and it (83:33 - 83:36)
wasn't that I think the other (83:35 - 83:37)
interesting thing is that it wasn't they (83:36 - 83:39)
didn't even tie into events right (83:37 - 83:41)
because you've got event outbreaks and (83:39 - 83:43)
event raids they didn't even do that (83:41 - 83:46)
where they could go oh we're going to (83:43 - 83:49)
have every Pokemon every Terror Pokemon (83:46 - 83:51)
on the map's going to be a fairy type or (83:49 - 83:53)
something like that they didn't even (83:51 - 83:55)
have something like that that could have (83:53 - 83:56)
didn't need to be something that was (83:55 - 83:57)
changing every day necessarily but would (83:56 - 83:59)
give you something different I I think (83:57 - 84:01)
they they leaned completely into raids (83:59 - 84:04)
for that sort of thing and then and then (84:01 - 84:06)
eventually outbreaks have either of you (84:04 - 84:08)
been paying close enough attention to (84:06 - 84:10)
the random Terra Pokemon in blueberry (84:08 - 84:13)
Academy to know if they stay the same (84:10 - 84:15)
every day or not because I don't think I (84:13 - 84:17)
mean I know they're different Pokemon (84:15 - 84:18)
every day and I think the locations are (84:17 - 84:21)
different too yeah I think that in (84:18 - 84:23)
blueberry they've they've improved on a (84:21 - 84:26)
lot of the criticisms that people have (84:23 - 84:30)
had on the Pala map for the first time (84:26 - 84:34)
last night I saw a stellar Tera drill (84:30 - 84:37)
bur not an Excadrill a drill bur which I (84:34 - 84:40)
was like (84:37 - 84:40)
what yeah and on the Slowpoke Beach (84:40 - 84:46)
there's a stellar Terra Pokemon there (84:43 - 84:47)
every single day but I think it's a (84:46 - 84:50)
different Pokemon every day yes I think (84:47 - 84:54)
so too um (84:50 - 84:54)
the only other thing I have regarding (84:55 - 85:01)
the epilogue which is more so the (84:58 - 85:03)
overall theme of the game which is uh (85:01 - 85:05)
the word (85:03 - 85:09)
paradox which we've they're called (85:05 - 85:13)
Paradox Pokemon I think now that the (85:09 - 85:15)
epilogue and the DLC is done and we met (85:13 - 85:18)
the professor who is (85:15 - 85:25)
alive at the lake was alive or is is (85:18 - 85:28)
a existed at some point in time (85:25 - 85:30)
somewhere and for some reason (85:28 - 85:35)
transported into your world yes (85:30 - 85:39)
yes um I have the definition of paradox (85:35 - 85:42)
a temporal (85:39 - 85:45)
Paradox a temporal Paradox time Paradox (85:42 - 85:50)
or time travel Paradox is a paradox an (85:45 - 85:53)
apparent contradiction or a logical iCal (85:50 - 85:55)
contradiction associated with the idea (85:53 - 85:57)
of time travel or other (85:55 - 86:00)
forn other forn knowledge of the future (85:57 - 86:03)
while the notion of time travel to the (86:00 - 86:04)
future complies with the current (86:03 - 86:06)
understanding of physics via relative (86:04 - 86:10)
time dilation temporal paradoxes arise (86:06 - 86:11)
from the circulation involving a (86:10 - 86:14)
hypothetical time travel to the past and (86:11 - 86:17)
often used to demonstrate the (86:14 - 86:17)
impossibility which I think is what they (86:20 - 86:26)
were going for in this entire game (86:23 - 86:28)
except that's the that's the problem I (86:26 - 86:30)
had with that because that's only time (86:28 - 86:32)
they needed to add the space in there (86:30 - 86:36)
which they did after the second DLC (86:32 - 86:38)
because all of the Paradox most of the (86:36 - 86:42)
Paradox Pokemon don't make sense just (86:38 - 86:45)
messing time up the ancient Paradox (86:42 - 86:47)
Pokemon is based off of a Pokeball (86:45 - 86:49)
design a modern Pokeball design the (86:47 - 86:51)
future Paradox (86:49 - 86:53)
Pokemon (86:51 - 86:56)
they're all mixed up well well I I I (86:53 - 86:59)
mean is there is there are you are you (86:56 - 87:01)
sure that's that's that's don't dig too (86:59 - 87:03)
deep into that there are other examples (87:01 - 87:05)
of the ancient Paradox Pokemon too I (87:03 - 87:06)
promise all right okay well I just I was (87:05 - 87:08)
gonna I was just going to argue because (87:06 - 87:09)
like I feel like the Pok√© Ball's based (87:08 - 87:10)
on it rather than the other way around (87:09 - 87:14)
but yeah don't take dig too deep in on (87:10 - 87:16)
that one but the Paradox Pokemon don't (87:14 - 87:19)
make sense if only time is slightly (87:16 - 87:21)
messed up being space slightly messed up (87:19 - 87:24)
as well was a necessary component I feel (87:21 - 87:26)
but yeah I mean that's that's that's (87:24 - 87:28)
what a paradox (87:26 - 87:32)
is yeah I (87:28 - 87:32)
I well the the the TCG uses doesn't use (87:32 - 87:39)
the word paradox they use the word um (87:36 - 87:41)
future and ancient which is not (87:39 - 87:43)
surprising like the TCG has to use (87:41 - 87:45)
specific words because of how mechanics (87:43 - 87:47)
work and and everything U but I mean (87:45 - 87:50)
it's still the general theme of like (87:47 - 87:53)
these Pokemon are old these Pokemon are (87:50 - 87:55)
new (87:53 - 87:57)
um the (87:55 - 88:00)
professor like your interaction with the (87:57 - 88:02)
professor like confirms that everything (88:00 - 88:05)
was like a paradox technically because (88:02 - 88:07)
you g gives you the book and then you (88:05 - 88:10)
start it and then it's like a loop (88:07 - 88:13)
technically so like I guess they (88:10 - 88:16)
accomplished that in a sense but of (88:13 - 88:17)
course they (88:16 - 88:20)
didn't there's so many unanswered (88:17 - 88:22)
questions in this game yeah yeah there (88:20 - 88:26)
are which which is like still like but (88:22 - 88:28)
at least they're a little bit more (88:26 - 88:30)
specific unanswered questions than we (88:28 - 88:32)
have had in previous games in previous (88:30 - 88:36)
games we've just had how does this make (88:32 - 88:39)
sense at all and this is how does this (88:36 - 88:40)
and this (88:39 - 88:44)
connect yeah why couldn't Rose wait 24 (88:40 - 88:47)
hours (88:44 - 88:47)
why well because he thought about it now (88:47 - 88:51)
therefore it has to happen now um I (88:49 - 88:54)
think they've all they have played with (88:51 - 88:56)
parallel timelines as well before right (88:54 - 88:59)
if you remember the Delta episode um so (88:56 - 89:00)
it's not like this is the first time (88:59 - 89:02)
they've done that sort of thing and that (89:00 - 89:05)
was more explicit that was we are (89:02 - 89:07)
sending this to a different Universe (89:05 - 89:09)
like that's not a it might go to a (89:07 - 89:10)
different universe that's how we are (89:09 - 89:12)
sending this the worry was oh it might (89:10 - 89:15)
hit a universe that has people still yes (89:12 - 89:17)
we've had the Delta episode we've had (89:15 - 89:19)
Ultra beasts and all of their worlds we (89:17 - 89:25)
have had Legends archus which in goes (89:19 - 89:25)
in we've had a Multiverse in Pokemon (89:25 - 89:30)
going for so long it's just kind of a (89:28 - 89:33)
squishy one and then the about megas as (89:30 - 89:34)
to whether they are a separate universe (89:33 - 89:37)
as well you know yeah Yep they're (89:34 - 89:40)
everywhere I I like what they did here (89:37 - 89:41)
where they didn't try and explain it (89:40 - 89:45)
they just went it's weird and we know (89:41 - 89:47)
that whatever we're going to say you're (89:45 - 89:49)
going to have you're going to pick holes (89:47 - 89:50)
in it so we're not going to say what (89:49 - 89:53)
we're just going to say yeah yes (89:50 - 89:56)
whatever you want it is (89:53 - 89:59)
that yeah I think that's (89:56 - 90:02)
fine I I I I I always think of like the (89:59 - 90:06)
Zelda timeline and how oh they like put (90:02 - 90:09)
out that book but like they knew that (90:06 - 90:11)
that book wouldn't satisfy anyone like (90:09 - 90:13)
that book was just a marketing gimmick (90:11 - 90:15)
to be like what was the Skyward Sword (90:13 - 90:19)
was like the first Zelda right yeah like (90:15 - 90:21)
you you're you're just using this as a (90:19 - 90:22)
marketing gimmick to be like (90:21 - 90:24)
well we're putting Skyward Sword at the (90:22 - 90:26)
beginning it's coming out soon here's (90:24 - 90:28)
the book of the timeline that still (90:26 - 90:30)
doesn't really make sense like I don't (90:28 - 90:33)
need all the Pokemon games to like line (90:30 - 90:36)
up and make sense completely and be (90:33 - 90:39)
like uh I guess also we didn't talk (90:36 - 90:42)
about how Penny's dad is the weird (90:39 - 90:48)
mining guy from I can't remember guy (90:42 - 90:48)
P yes I a bunch of people were very (90:48 - 90:53)
excited about that sword and shield were (90:51 - 90:55)
not my favorite games so I never would (90:53 - 90:56)
have noticed if someone had not pointed (90:55 - 91:00)
it out to me but yeah Penny and PN and (90:56 - 91:03)
ponia and apparently Penny's name in (91:00 - 91:05)
Japanese is another kind of Pi and yes (91:03 - 91:07)
there's a connection there yeah I mean (91:05 - 91:10)
it's not it's not explicit it's implied (91:07 - 91:12)
based on it's heavily implied yeah it's (91:10 - 91:14)
heavily implied based on a word that no (91:12 - 91:18)
one else has used in the two words yes (91:14 - 91:22)
Adventure something and then ad ad then (91:18 - 91:26)
I can't Adventure yeah tour that's what (91:22 - 91:28)
it is yeah um but it's still not (91:26 - 91:29)
explicitly stated which I'm not saying (91:28 - 91:31)
everything has to be but I'm I'm just (91:29 - 91:32)
saying if you want to pretend that it's (91:31 - 91:34)
something else you (91:32 - 91:36)
can but if it is that if you want to (91:34 - 91:38)
pretend they are slightly more distant (91:36 - 91:40)
relatives yeah that family need to be (91:38 - 91:42)
better at naming their children that's (91:40 - 91:45)
all I'm saying right you just slightly (91:42 - 91:47)
change one of their names and that's all (91:45 - 91:49)
the children's (91:47 - 91:51)
names does does Penny ever say that she (91:49 - 91:54)
has a sister (91:51 - 91:54)
you know I was talking to Greg and Greg (91:54 - 91:59)
said that Penny said yes but I don't (91:56 - 92:01)
remember ever hearing Penny talk about a (91:59 - 92:04)
sister yeah I don't remember (92:01 - 92:06)
either (92:04 - 92:07)
um (92:06 - 92:09)
anyways if Hannah doesn't know I'm (92:07 - 92:11)
certainly not gonna (92:09 - 92:14)
know that's yeah let's ask the guy who (92:11 - 92:16)
doesn't read (92:14 - 92:18)
uh that's all I have for the epilog (92:16 - 92:21)
unless I missed anything Hannah that I I (92:18 - 92:23)
you wanted to cover that I didn't bring (92:21 - 92:25)
up initially are we going to talk about (92:23 - 92:28)
petron's story that's only on (92:25 - 92:31)
YouTube uh we could if I watched it I (92:28 - 92:33)
have not watched it Steve what is it you (92:31 - 92:36)
and not watching YouTube stuff it's (92:33 - 92:39)
because first I saw it on Twitter and I (92:36 - 92:41)
hit play and then after 30 seconds I was (92:39 - 92:44)
like this is five minutes long I'll come (92:41 - 92:46)
back to it later I thought it was fun I (92:44 - 92:48)
I I know that people disagree with me I (92:46 - 92:49)
think it would be fun to have some of (92:48 - 92:52)
that story somewhere in the game um but (92:49 - 92:55)
I I thought it was it was fun um we also (92:52 - 92:56)
haven't talked about petun (92:55 - 93:00)
itself I like I like it I think it's a (92:56 - 93:02)
fun I when it's closed I don't like when (93:00 - 93:04)
it (93:02 - 93:04)
opens um I also think that the story (93:05 - 93:12)
about how in the no of course yeah (93:09 - 93:14)
you've not read That's all in the video (93:12 - 93:15)
no I mean you can talk about the video (93:14 - 93:17)
it's not that big it kind of it reframes (93:15 - 93:20)
things again in a third way right cuz (93:17 - 93:22)
you start off framing (93:20 - 93:26)
the um the loyal three as as the goodies (93:22 - 93:29)
and then they're reframed as the baddies (93:26 - 93:31)
and then they're reframed (93:29 - 93:35)
as kind of complicated and peterin is (93:31 - 93:38)
kind of complicated and it's all a bit (93:35 - 93:41)
like they're not good or bad (93:38 - 93:43)
they're Pokemon I guess doing what (93:41 - 93:47)
they're meant to be doing which maybe is (93:43 - 93:49)
point that probably is the point I (93:47 - 93:51)
really like this thing that Pokemon has (93:49 - 93:54)
honestly done for longer than uh people (93:51 - 93:56)
usually think about it where they do (93:54 - 93:58)
reframe these stories from multiple (93:56 - 94:00)
points of view they they point out how (93:58 - 94:02)
one story can be viewed completely (94:00 - 94:05)
differently or or how a myth can be (94:02 - 94:07)
mashed up into multiple different things (94:05 - 94:09)
Al together and you don't know the (94:07 - 94:11)
actual truth but they're absolutely (94:09 - 94:12)
doing this (94:11 - 94:15)
here I have kind of mixed feelings about (94:12 - 94:17)
it partially because it makes the whole (94:15 - 94:20)
Kieran Theory more complicated (94:17 - 94:23)
but um (94:20 - 94:24)
yeah I think some people came away from (94:23 - 94:27)
that video seeing petrun as good and (94:24 - 94:30)
maybe ogron as bad because that that (94:27 - 94:32)
video is more from ogre Pond's point of (94:30 - 94:34)
view but I rewatched it again this (94:32 - 94:35)
morning and it it really is kind of (94:34 - 94:37)
closer to (94:35 - 94:40)
neutral it's just very much that's like (94:37 - 94:43)
Pokemon in general they want like that's (94:40 - 94:44)
what I was going to say I think it (94:43 - 94:46)
frames them in the same way that many (94:44 - 94:47)
Pokemon things have done which is they (94:46 - 94:49)
do what they're told by humans and so if (94:47 - 94:51)
they're raised by bad humans they're (94:49 - 94:53)
going to do bad things not that I'm (94:51 - 94:54)
necessarily saying that they because (94:53 - 94:56)
there's a complication in that the old (94:54 - 94:58)
couple are kind of kind of controlled by (94:56 - 95:01)
influenced by pant and it's a bit that's (94:58 - 95:04)
a bit complicated but I'm not saying (95:01 - 95:06)
they're inherently bad either it's it's (95:04 - 95:08)
more a case of (95:06 - 95:11)
like taking things too literally I guess (95:08 - 95:15)
in terms of wanting to get things I mean (95:11 - 95:18)
peton Mochi draws out desires and so (95:15 - 95:20)
pant is trying to accomplish what the (95:18 - 95:23)
people that cares about desire (95:20 - 95:28)
fire I don't remember a lot of (95:23 - 95:30)
the speculation that was sword and (95:28 - 95:33)
shield I remember two things I remember (95:30 - 95:35)
everyone thinking that there was going (95:33 - 95:38)
to be armored Pokemon as the gimmick and (95:35 - 95:40)
that that didn't happen and then I (95:38 - 95:42)
remember people saying we're going to (95:40 - 95:46)
have our first truly evil Pokemon which (95:42 - 95:48)
was supposed to be (95:46 - 95:51)
eternus and I remember thinking that of (95:48 - 95:53)
like because because again Pokemon (95:51 - 95:55)
always frames every Pokemon like what Al (95:53 - 95:56)
said is like they're only bad because (95:55 - 95:59)
they got bad people but like every (95:56 - 96:01)
Pokemon is like even Mewtwo is like soft (95:59 - 96:03)
and cuddly and cute you know Giovani (96:01 - 96:07)
just strapped him into a computer uh (96:03 - 96:11)
which is like fine whatever I get that (96:07 - 96:11)
um I I don't think the Pokemon company (96:12 - 96:19)
ever portrayed eternus as like evil it (96:16 - 96:22)
was just being controlled yeah it was (96:19 - 96:24)
another Pokemon that was being (96:22 - 96:27)
captivated and that was yeah being (96:24 - 96:29)
captured and trying to be controlled I (96:27 - 96:30)
think the one Pokemon that I've had (96:29 - 96:33)
people point out to me as maybe the (96:30 - 96:35)
closest we have gotten to an evil (96:33 - 96:39)
Pokemon is gutina in (96:35 - 96:39)
Legends but even that like was being (96:39 - 96:45)
controlled by (96:42 - 96:45)
Volo was I to a certain extent or was it (96:46 - 96:52)
the other way around (96:50 - 96:55)
I mean he threw the Pok ball did he (96:52 - 96:58)
not I think it came out of a (96:55 - 97:01)
Pokeball no I think it came out of a (96:58 - 97:04)
breach in the universe (97:01 - 97:04)
um but even gutina you can like pet and (97:06 - 97:11)
cuddle with with the Pokemon a me (97:09 - 97:13)
feature in and (97:11 - 97:16)
moon the eternus one is is also (97:13 - 97:17)
interesting because they go even harder (97:16 - 97:19)
into actually eternus is good in the (97:17 - 97:22)
anime cuz I don't know if you remember (97:19 - 97:24)
um oh see I did not see that part of the (97:22 - 97:26)
anime so they they do they do address (97:24 - 97:30)
eternus in the anime being like good (97:26 - 97:32)
yeah so so the so Ash's final battle (97:30 - 97:34)
spoilers for a year and a half old (97:32 - 97:38)
episode um Ash's final battle with Leon (97:34 - 97:40)
is interrupted by eternus and it seems (97:38 - 97:42)
like oh no bad things are happening but (97:40 - 97:44)
at the end of it they're just like oh no (97:42 - 97:47)
eternus was just protecting us from (97:44 - 97:50)
something it was like some gigantamax (97:47 - 97:51)
power or something anyway doesn't really (97:50 - 97:52)
matter (97:51 - 97:53)
that that's that that was the conclusion (97:52 - 97:55)
it was like no no no we thought we (97:53 - 97:57)
thought eternus was being bad but no it (97:55 - 98:00)
was just protecting us that's it yeah (97:57 - 98:03)
which is even more explicit than in the (98:00 - 98:06)
games yeah I remember like the first (98:03 - 98:08)
like episode of Journeys I think like (98:06 - 98:11)
eternus is like flying near the plane (98:08 - 98:13)
and they're like oh we felt (98:11 - 98:15)
something (98:13 - 98:19)
okay we'll get back to this in 300 (98:15 - 98:23)
episodes yeah (98:19 - 98:23)
um yeah it's it's interesting that they (98:25 - 98:29)
did that in a YouTube (98:27 - 98:33)
video and not put it anywhere in the (98:29 - 98:36)
game yeah I was thinking this morning (98:33 - 98:38)
maybe they did that just so that could (98:36 - 98:41)
be one thing data miners couldn't (98:38 - 98:43)
find (98:41 - 98:46)
but yeah maybe they just made it too (98:43 - 98:47)
late and it was too behind schedule I (98:46 - 98:48)
don't (98:47 - 98:51)
know yeah I mean regardless of it was in (98:48 - 98:53)
the game or not it's should be on (98:51 - 98:55)
YouTube anyways (98:53 - 98:58)
for like it doesn't hurt anything being (98:55 - 99:00)
on (98:58 - 99:02)
YouTube so yeah the the video they (99:00 - 99:04)
released right before the epilog came (99:02 - 99:06)
out with the magical petchup Barry or (99:04 - 99:10)
whatever that was was also very good and (99:06 - 99:13)
yeah that was also should be in the game (99:10 - 99:15)
it was amazing I had just been wondering (99:13 - 99:17)
if I had been pronouncing Petra the (99:15 - 99:19)
right way before I started it and had (99:17 - 99:20)
been thinking about that for five (99:19 - 99:23)
minutes and then the video just goes and (99:20 - 99:27)
says petol like 15 20 times the I guess (99:23 - 99:29)
the other the last thing that I've (99:27 - 99:30)
thought about this (99:29 - 99:34)
is we don't have an end date for this (99:30 - 99:37)
Mystery Gift do we Steve we don't so I (99:34 - 99:39)
feel like that's very unusual for them (99:37 - 99:42)
to do and I suspect it's like it will (99:39 - 99:44)
just be available for as long as you can (99:42 - 99:47)
really connect to online in these games (99:44 - 99:51)
which is probably the best they can do (99:47 - 99:54)
with with regards to making this event a (99:51 - 99:58)
thing you have to experience and get (99:54 - 99:59)
through the internet and still also make (99:58 - 100:02)
it as accessible as possible um well I (99:59 - 100:05)
mean (100:02 - 100:05)
like it should just be in the game like (100:05 - 100:11)
if I if I go out and I buy sword and (100:08 - 100:14)
shield right now the DLC pack I can get (100:11 - 100:18)
cellio no matter what if at some point (100:14 - 100:20)
in 10 years I can't enter a mystery gift (100:18 - 100:23)
code I'm out of this yeah they have been (100:20 - 100:25)
they have been making them more (100:23 - 100:27)
accessible as I I actually I I checked (100:25 - 100:29)
this today because I wanted to find out (100:27 - 100:31)
all of one gen one to gen four mythical (100:29 - 100:34)
Pokemon you can now get from a game (100:31 - 100:37)
without an event all all of them and two (100:34 - 100:40)
of the Gen five ones um which I don't (100:37 - 100:42)
know we have we actually talked about (100:40 - 100:44)
the other mythical in this game since (100:42 - 100:46)
the (100:44 - 100:46)
DLC uh blanking on what that other (100:48 - 100:52)
mythical is (100:50 - 100:56)
Meloetta I don't know yeah mea have we (100:52 - 100:57)
we talked about that I don't think we (100:56 - 100:59)
talked we I mean that is wild because (100:57 - 101:00)
it's (100:59 - 101:04)
like ABS it took days for people to (101:00 - 101:06)
actually figure out how to encounter the (101:04 - 101:08)
Pokemon and I was so convinced that it (101:06 - 101:10)
was going to be because Victini is (101:08 - 101:12)
technically in sword and shield but you (101:10 - 101:14)
cannot encounter itz there is like an (101:12 - 101:16)
encounter but it doesn't it never you (101:14 - 101:19)
can't have that encounter and I was (101:16 - 101:20)
fully expecting this to be the exact (101:19 - 101:22)
same thing because you have to be in (101:20 - 101:24)
this very specific Place doing this very (101:22 - 101:26)
specific thing with the camera and a (101:24 - 101:28)
specific filter it's I mean I love it (101:26 - 101:30)
but it's (101:28 - 101:32)
weird well the the victi thing makes (101:30 - 101:34)
sense in retrospect because it was given (101:32 - 101:36)
away at Worlds I don't think that was (101:34 - 101:39)
like like a panic button they hit I I I (101:36 - 101:41)
would it's not the same it's not the (101:39 - 101:43)
same one though the encounter's (101:41 - 101:46)
different like this is this is more (101:43 - 101:50)
like my my guess would have been that (101:46 - 101:53)
there would have been more more to the (101:50 - 101:56)
Victini like you get an item to like (101:53 - 101:58)
trigger an encounter and they never (101:56 - 102:00)
finish that encounter they never did (101:58 - 102:01)
that they just like left the assets (102:00 - 102:03)
there and then instead they were just (102:01 - 102:04)
like we're just going to give people (102:03 - 102:05)
we're just going to give it because they (102:04 - 102:06)
gave everyone bigi you didn't have to go (102:05 - 102:10)
to Worlds to get vitini but if if the if (102:06 - 102:12)
the thought process (102:10 - 102:15)
was fans are complaining that they want (102:12 - 102:17)
mythicals to feel special we did the Zer (102:15 - 102:20)
Ora thing we did the Celio thing we're (102:17 - 102:22)
doing the mow a thing it would only make (102:20 - 102:25)
sense for Victini to have its own thing (102:22 - 102:27)
and like classic Pokemon we don't have (102:25 - 102:29)
enough time because we're work to the (102:27 - 102:32)
Bone so here's just a distribution of (102:29 - 102:34)
vitini yeah I mean then then you get (102:32 - 102:35)
into the question of why is the (102:34 - 102:37)
encounter still in the game it just was (102:35 - 102:38)
never coded to work and I guess that's (102:37 - 102:40)
just because they never they leave (102:38 - 102:42)
things in the game all the time I know I (102:40 - 102:45)
know I know I know (102:42 - 102:49)
but a nice surprise the Paradox Pokemon (102:45 - 102:50)
were supposed to drop something and it (102:49 - 102:52)
didn't crash raids and it took him like (102:50 - 102:56)
three months to fix (102:52 - 102:56)
it yeah yeah yeah did we ever get those (102:57 - 103:02)
that Raid event ever again I can't (103:00 - 103:05)
remember it came back it did come back (103:02 - 103:06)
it came back there's been so many events (103:05 - 103:09)
since then that I've forgotten but also (103:06 - 103:12)
bringing this back to the mythical (103:09 - 103:15)
magical Petra Berry and the epilog I (103:12 - 103:18)
think this is the distribution is (103:15 - 103:19)
probably the best way they could have (103:18 - 103:21)
done it they're also (103:19 - 103:24)
aren't any physical cartridges out at (103:21 - 103:26)
this point in time with both of the DLCs (103:24 - 103:28)
on them so you're going to run into the (103:26 - 103:31)
issue anyways unless they update those (103:28 - 103:33)
don't worry when the next DLC for (103:31 - 103:34)
scarlet and violet comes out then (103:33 - 103:38)
they'll put out the Third Edition of (103:34 - 103:41)
this on shelves and that'll be$ 1220 (103:38 - 103:44)
some dollars right this is just what (103:41 - 103:47)
they were able to do to conclude the (103:44 - 103:50)
story without having it be another (103:47 - 103:52)
payment for another deal (103:50 - 103:54)
DLC I do think because I mean we (103:52 - 103:57)
essentially did get the third DLC right (103:54 - 103:59)
because people yeah it's not a paid (103:57 - 104:01)
thing right but this is a third a third (103:59 - 104:05)
thing in like got it is downloadable (104:01 - 104:06)
content yes I just think I just think (104:05 - 104:09)
it's like well because it's the argument (104:06 - 104:11)
was oh we're going to have a third you (104:09 - 104:12)
know you've got your te mask you got the (104:11 - 104:13)
endigo disc and we're going to have a (104:12 - 104:15)
third thing and we did have a third (104:13 - 104:17)
thing it wasn't the teal mask or the (104:15 - 104:19)
Indigo disc it was a third thing I think (104:17 - 104:20)
that's interesting it's it's different (104:19 - 104:22)
to how they did sword and shield where (104:20 - 104:23)
they had the two and they were (104:22 - 104:24)
completely (104:23 - 104:27)
separate yeah I mean like go ahead the (104:24 - 104:30)
story in these games has been some of my (104:27 - 104:32)
favorites they have tied together the (104:30 - 104:35)
story from the first main story line to (104:32 - 104:37)
the story from the DLC bringing it all (104:35 - 104:41)
together in the epilog and I think the (104:37 - 104:43)
epilogue was kind of necessary for that (104:41 - 104:44)
so all of that is very different from (104:43 - 104:47)
what they did in sword and shield as (104:44 - 104:49)
well I (104:47 - 104:53)
mean Pokemon day is a month (104:49 - 104:55)
away (104:53 - 104:59)
um gen 10 would be next right like seven (104:55 - 105:02)
eight nine 10 right so there's there's (104:59 - 105:04)
no there's no there's no surprises that (105:02 - 105:05)
there would be another generation of (105:04 - 105:08)
Pokemon and if you're looking at purely (105:05 - 105:13)
remakes gen five is next right they like (105:08 - 105:17)
just the the the numbers go higher right (105:13 - 105:19)
like I it' be very weird if they skipped (105:17 - 105:21)
gen five to go to gen right that would (105:19 - 105:24)
just be weird they could do it um they (105:21 - 105:27)
could also go back to gen two they could (105:24 - 105:29)
go back to gen two right because they (105:27 - 105:32)
did gen one three times now so they (105:29 - 105:34)
could do gen two three times now there's (105:32 - 105:35)
like a lot of things they could do like (105:34 - 105:38)
no one predicted archus you know when (105:35 - 105:40)
when sword and shield came out that was (105:38 - 105:41)
three years of people being like they're (105:40 - 105:44)
going to add the complete (105:41 - 105:46)
Pokedex and they never did and it was (105:44 - 105:48)
even after the two DLCs they were like (105:46 - 105:50)
they're going to add a third DLC and (105:48 - 105:51)
they're they're going to finish the (105:50 - 105:55)
Pokedex and they they they never did (105:51 - 105:58)
um and when Legends archus came out (105:55 - 106:00)
people were like can't wait for the (105:58 - 106:03)
DLC and this is the weird definition of (106:00 - 106:06)
DLC but like it wasn't a paid DLC right (106:03 - 106:08)
it was like a forced update that you had (106:06 - 106:11)
to take that didn't add any new areas (106:08 - 106:13)
changed outbreaks a little bit didn't (106:11 - 106:15)
add any new (106:13 - 106:18)
Pokemon yeah like so that game didn't (106:15 - 106:21)
get DLC and then you looked at uh (106:18 - 106:23)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl do we (106:21 - 106:26)
have to didn't have any DLC should have (106:23 - 106:28)
had DLC honestly if any of these Games (106:26 - 106:31)
should had DLC they should have put we (106:28 - 106:33)
we added the Platinum part of the game (106:31 - 106:36)
into this and it it's now better it's (106:33 - 106:39)
now good we've added two buttons to your (106:36 - 106:43)
poke ET like in Pokemon Platinum so like (106:39 - 106:44)
could there (106:43 - 106:47)
be I feel like I'm a broken record could (106:44 - 106:49)
there be another set of DLC for scarlet (106:47 - 106:52)
Violet sure yes Pokemon is very (106:49 - 106:54)
unpredictable like Pokemon Z never (106:52 - 106:57)
happened Pokemon Gray never happened (106:54 - 107:01)
like sure we could get another but the (106:57 - 107:03)
the actual thing you should be asking is (107:01 - 107:06)
like do you want a third DLC because or (107:03 - 107:08)
fourth I don't whatever you want to (107:06 - 107:09)
consider it because my (107:08 - 107:12)
answer yeah do you want another DLC for (107:09 - 107:14)
scarlet and violet because my answer is (107:12 - 107:18)
no I I think those games are too broken (107:14 - 107:20)
and too frame rate and tooo many bugs (107:18 - 107:24)
and glitch is and I do sincerely believe (107:20 - 107:26)
that scarlet and violet would be a top (107:24 - 107:28)
three Pokemon game for almost (107:26 - 107:32)
anyone if it ran properly if it didn't (107:28 - 107:35)
have all these issues if when you're (107:32 - 107:37)
battling Petra run and Kieran goes catch (107:35 - 107:40)
it that everything behind it wasn't (107:37 - 107:42)
running at one frame a second and you're (107:40 - 107:46)
like why is this so slow right now and I (107:42 - 107:47)
know that some people don't care about (107:46 - 107:49)
frame rate or it doesn't bother them or (107:47 - 107:51)
they can't see it but the general (107:49 - 107:54)
consensus is that these games are are (107:51 - 107:58)
badly optimized and not great um now (107:54 - 107:59)
that's the that's not to say that old (107:58 - 108:01)
Pokemon games were better optimized I'm (107:59 - 108:04)
looking at you Gen 4 with the slowest HP (108:01 - 108:08)
bars in the entire world like this isn't (108:04 - 108:10)
a new thing for game freak but for all (108:08 - 108:12)
the speculation of like there's going to (108:10 - 108:15)
be another DLC for scarlet and violet (108:12 - 108:18)
like that's like for me it's like just (108:15 - 108:21)
start over if even if you can't get it (108:18 - 108:25)
done this year just like take what (108:21 - 108:26)
you've done here take what you've (108:25 - 108:30)
learned and reoptimize for another game (108:26 - 108:32)
and they did that they did that from (108:30 - 108:34)
diamond and pro to Platinum Platinum is (108:32 - 108:37)
so much better than diamond and PE when (108:34 - 108:38)
it comes to optimization when it comes (108:37 - 108:41)
to flow when it comes to features and (108:38 - 108:44)
accessibility it's just a better game so (108:41 - 108:46)
when I say like game freaks bad at (108:44 - 108:48)
making games (108:46 - 108:53)
yes like they are and but they also are (108:48 - 108:55)
good at fixing their mistakes for the (108:53 - 108:57)
next game and they're good at fixing (108:55 - 109:00)
their mistakes as they move forward (108:57 - 109:01)
regardless of whether it's a next game (109:00 - 109:03)
or not I I do want to kind of emphasize (109:01 - 109:05)
that blueberry Academy is a (109:03 - 109:08)
significantly better and more fun place (109:05 - 109:12)
to play than Pala is they are improving (109:08 - 109:16)
on this gradually even in these DLCs but (109:12 - 109:19)
also the story there feels done we (109:16 - 109:20)
didn't get all the answers but the story (109:19 - 109:21)
feels (109:20 - 109:23)
done I'm sure the next games will be (109:21 - 109:26)
just as disappointing in some ways um (109:23 - 109:28)
but yeah like they they'll I mean I like (109:26 - 109:30)
I mean I love these games right I I I (109:28 - 109:32)
agree with you this would be one of my I (109:30 - 109:34)
think probably one of my top two if it (109:32 - 109:36)
weren't for the issues and I'm someone (109:34 - 109:38)
who goes oh I don't notice framewor (109:36 - 109:40)
issues I don't care about Graphics but (109:38 - 109:43)
no I noticed it in this game like feel (109:40 - 109:45)
the difference even if you you don't (109:43 - 109:47)
necessarily see it even if you don't (109:45 - 109:49)
necessarily (109:47 - 109:52)
care in in those terms you notice it I (109:49 - 109:54)
think in most games I would disagree (109:52 - 109:55)
with you but I think it's impossible not (109:54 - 109:58)
to see it in this game like it's not (109:55 - 110:00)
even just a feeling in this one like I I (109:58 - 110:01)
don't I've never really understood that (110:00 - 110:03)
like 60 versus 120 frames per second (110:01 - 110:06)
except in Pokemon go weirdly that one (110:03 - 110:08)
that one really got me um (110:06 - 110:12)
but you you can't not see it like you (110:08 - 110:14)
you have to be blind to not see the (110:12 - 110:16)
frame weight rate issues in this game (110:14 - 110:18)
it's I think I'm going blind but I can (110:16 - 110:19)
still see it I think my eyesight is (110:18 - 110:21)
getting worse and worse every (110:19 - 110:23)
but we will also see quality of life (110:21 - 110:25)
improvements that we got in Legends for (110:23 - 110:27)
example some of them will go over to to (110:25 - 110:30)
to the next games um because we we see (110:27 - 110:31)
that all the time right like you keep (110:30 - 110:33)
they Leap Frog them their the quality of (110:31 - 110:36)
life improvements they have some in one (110:33 - 110:37)
game and then we don't get them in the (110:36 - 110:39)
next game and it's frustrating that we (110:37 - 110:40)
didn't get that in that game but then (110:39 - 110:42)
you get it in the next one because of (110:40 - 110:44)
the way that they do their development (110:42 - 110:47)
cycle yeah I just I just feel that these (110:44 - 110:51)
games are like complete now mhm um it (110:47 - 110:52)
would be weird if they tried to add (110:51 - 110:54)
another story to this I think because it (110:52 - 110:56)
definitely not that they couldn't do it (110:54 - 110:59)
they could do a good story and it a (110:56 - 111:01)
different thing but it would feel weird (110:59 - 111:02)
in terms of like this feels like they're (111:01 - 111:05)
saying we're done like it's called an (111:02 - 111:08)
epilogue that's literally what that is (111:05 - 111:10)
it's saying a little bit of story after (111:08 - 111:13)
the end that's what an epilogue is it's (111:10 - 111:16)
not then but we're going to have more (111:13 - 111:22)
Story the next DLC is the Pro (111:16 - 111:22)
l i mean they could they have they could (111:22 - 111:28)
yeah you go back in time why not they've (111:25 - 111:30)
already done weird things with time (111:28 - 111:33)
maybe yeah I I mean I I I don't know (111:30 - 111:35)
what's next (111:33 - 111:38)
I I would completely be okay with them (111:35 - 111:39)
being like you know what we don't got (111:38 - 111:42)
anything this year we got we here's (111:39 - 111:44)
here's a spin-off well as long as they (111:42 - 111:45)
give us a spin-off cuz we didn't get a (111:44 - 111:48)
spin we only got one spin-off last year (111:45 - 111:49)
right and we only got and it was (111:48 - 111:51)
detective Pikachu (111:49 - 111:53)
hardens when when I say we don't have (111:51 - 111:55)
anything this year I just mean like main (111:53 - 111:57)
series cuz the last the last time they (111:55 - 111:58)
skipped (111:57 - 112:00)
was (111:58 - 112:04)
2016 I think it was (112:00 - 112:07)
between oh was it between X and Y and (112:04 - 112:09)
Omega Ruby or Omega Ruby and sun and (112:07 - 112:10)
moon Omega Ruby and sun and moon I'm (112:09 - 112:12)
pretty sure and I'm pretty sure it was (112:10 - 112:15)
2015 15 yeah yes yes yeah you're correct (112:12 - 112:19)
cuz 2016 was Pok√©mon go sun and moon (112:15 - 112:21)
yeah so (112:19 - 112:22)
I wouldn't be upset if they skipped a (112:21 - 112:26)
year I think that this game still has a (112:22 - 112:28)
solid year of Life uh we just got the (112:26 - 112:31)
sevenstar Blazin which means we'll (112:28 - 112:33)
probably get a seven star Swamper and a (112:31 - 112:36)
sevenstar incinerar and sevenstar Prem (112:33 - 112:38)
Marina like they can just do Seven Stars (112:36 - 112:42)
for every single starter and that will (112:38 - 112:44)
keep people engaged they can continue (112:42 - 112:47)
doing mass outbreaks for shinies or for (112:44 - 112:49)
Marks they can do a sevenstar shiny Ray (112:47 - 112:51)
quazo which I still think is coming I (112:49 - 112:53)
still think that's a thing that they're (112:51 - 112:54)
going to (112:53 - 112:57)
do um and shiny breakway will bring (112:54 - 112:59)
plenty of people back but also at the (112:57 - 113:00)
same time they don't need to bring (112:59 - 113:02)
people back they're it's not a games to (113:00 - 113:06)
service they they they they have (113:02 - 113:11)
sold they have sold their DLC like yeah (113:06 - 113:13)
they're they're fine the interesting (113:11 - 113:15)
thing about the year off is they they (113:13 - 113:18)
regularly took years off until 2015 that (113:15 - 113:20)
was the last year they didn't if you (113:18 - 113:22)
include dlc's it was the last year (113:20 - 113:24)
without main series Pok√©mon but they did (113:22 - 113:28)
it many times 97 2001 2003 2005 2007 (113:24 - 113:32)
2011 and 2015 they were all years where (113:28 - 113:34)
they didn't have a main Series game so (113:32 - 113:36)
it's not like it would be an odd thing (113:34 - 113:38)
we can maybe ignore the the 97 because (113:36 - 113:42)
obviously they that was we're not making (113:38 - 113:44)
patterns based on gen (113:42 - 113:47)
one I mean honestly when scarlet and (113:44 - 113:49)
violet came out and there was all of the (113:47 - 113:51)
push back with people going these (113:49 - 113:55)
games are kind of are kind of buggy (113:51 - 113:58)
they're kind of bad um and they actually (113:55 - 114:02)
did react and say we hear you they did (113:58 - 114:03)
have to put out a press message saying (114:02 - 114:05)
we're hearing the feedback and we will (114:03 - 114:07)
take it into account as we're making the (114:05 - 114:10)
next games I just hope they do that's (114:07 - 114:12)
that's why I would be okay with not (114:10 - 114:17)
getting a new game this year yeah and I (114:12 - 114:18)
don't Ila could still release something (114:17 - 114:20)
I don't know if we want to see another (114:18 - 114:22)
game from ilka but (114:20 - 114:25)
they I'm still not convinced that ilka's (114:22 - 114:26)
the problem with that game I think the (114:25 - 114:28)
problem was the decisions made by (114:26 - 114:31)
Management in that game and and I I (114:28 - 114:34)
don't we can't make assumptions on a (114:31 - 114:37)
development team um like with one game (114:34 - 114:39)
yeah well we can't make it I don't think (114:37 - 114:41)
we can make a decision like I'm I'm very (114:39 - 114:43)
strong that like I (114:41 - 114:46)
think that you could absolutely be it (114:43 - 114:47)
could be one person making the bad (114:46 - 114:50)
decisions that make the game bad um yeah (114:47 - 114:53)
but that's always the case but you but (114:50 - 114:55)
scarlet and violet could also be (114:53 - 114:57)
primarily down to the management just (114:55 - 115:00)
saying get this game out now yes I agree (114:57 - 115:03)
but the the remakes in particular if we (115:00 - 115:05)
assume that Ela would only make remakes (115:03 - 115:06)
right we assume they're not going to (115:05 - 115:08)
make a main a new main Series game (115:06 - 115:10)
they're going to make remakes or you (115:08 - 115:13)
know other spin-offs they're not as tied (115:10 - 115:18)
to the merch line that the main the new (115:13 - 115:20)
main Series games are (115:18 - 115:22)
um which is (115:20 - 115:25)
typically quoted as the reason as to why (115:22 - 115:26)
they're constantly doing things right (115:25 - 115:28)
because they have many years UPF front (115:26 - 115:30)
of these are the what we're going to be (115:28 - 115:32)
doing with merch and with the anime and (115:30 - 115:33)
the trading card game and they all need (115:32 - 115:36)
to line up remakes don't require that (115:33 - 115:38)
maybe with trading card game they tend (115:36 - 115:41)
to do like sets of the trading card game (115:38 - 115:43)
but yeah I mean like you just look at a (115:41 - 115:46)
like a Pokemon you look at like a (115:43 - 115:48)
Pokemon developer like umbrella which no (115:46 - 115:50)
longer exists and there they they didn't (115:48 - 115:51)
release a single they released what like (115:50 - 115:55)
eight Pokemon games Hey You (115:51 - 115:57)
Pikachu is the one they're probably (115:55 - 115:59)
known the most for but there wasn't a (115:57 - 116:02)
single there wasn't a single game that (115:59 - 116:06)
umbrella released that was good and so (116:02 - 116:08)
like My worry (116:06 - 116:11)
is I don't want that like ilka to be the (116:08 - 116:12)
next (116:11 - 116:15)
umbrella um because Pokemon home ain't (116:12 - 116:18)
that good either we know it on that yeah (116:15 - 116:21)
I get I guess maybe my my point I guess (116:18 - 116:24)
is like Ila weren't in charge of that (116:21 - 116:27)
game they were developing it but massuda (116:24 - 116:29)
was essentially in charge of they were (116:27 - 116:32)
two two producers and mudo was one of (116:29 - 116:33)
them and I'm not trying to point out an (116:32 - 116:35)
individual I'm saying mudo is the (116:33 - 116:37)
problem that's not my point my point is (116:35 - 116:39)
Game Freak were still very much involved (116:37 - 116:42)
in that game and making decisions for (116:39 - 116:45)
that game Ila 100% didn't make any of (116:42 - 116:47)
those decisions about we're going to put (116:45 - 116:49)
this feature in but not that feature you (116:47 - 116:51)
can you can blame them for the bugs of (116:49 - 116:53)
course still pretty buy games and the (116:51 - 116:55)
movement of the game was still pretty (116:53 - 117:02)
abely so yeah I agree I I suspect a that (116:55 - 117:02)
shiny I think I still love I still love (117:04 - 117:09)
the look of those games even though they (117:07 - 117:11)
were terrible to play I love how they (117:09 - 117:13)
looked and I know we're probably never (117:11 - 117:14)
going to get another game that looked (117:13 - 117:16)
like that but I just think it was so (117:14 - 117:20)
ridiculous and the this especially with (117:16 - 117:22)
certain story beats and you've got this (117:20 - 117:25)
really angry face on this deeny Dy but I (117:22 - 117:27)
just loved it so (117:25 - 117:30)
much all right uh well that's our (117:27 - 117:32)
episode for the day uh we will be back (117:30 - 117:36)
next week I think we're going to I don't (117:32 - 117:39)
know if the new TCG set the new TCG set (117:36 - 117:42)
should be out by next week (117:39 - 117:46)
so uh we might have Bobby on to talk TCG (117:42 - 117:48)
because (117:46 - 117:51)
um he's the T he's he's the one spending (117:48 - 117:53)
the money not me actually I did order (117:51 - 117:55)
the new set but not as much as I (117:53 - 117:58)
normally order but uh thanks for making (117:55 - 118:00)
to the end thanks for listening thanks (117:58 - 118:04)
Hannah thanks Al um yeah we'll be back (118:00 - 118:07)
next week and we are yeah about a month (118:04 - 118:09)
out from Pokemon day so that's that's (118:07 - 118:11)
exciting so we'll we'll see what they (118:09 - 118:14)
what they offer us if (118:11 - 118:16)
anything I'm under this impression that (118:14 - 118:18)
not every Pokemon day can top the (118:16 - 118:21)
previous year Pokemon (118:18 - 118:25)
day So eventually last (118:21 - 118:28)
year's perfect then then you can't (118:25 - 118:29)
actually you could still be disappointed (118:28 - 118:32)
even if you don't remember (118:29 - 118:34)
um uh all right well that's that's our (118:32 - 118:36)
episode uh we'll see you guys next week (118:34 - 118:37)
