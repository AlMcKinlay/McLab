entered the curve did you get (4:04 - 4:07)
did you get the other two (4:06 - 4:09)
heck yeah because yeah here's the (4:07 - 4:10)
problem (4:09 - 4:13)
which i think i've said before (4:10 - 4:16)
i can't find galerion articuno i go up (4:13 - 4:17)
on that hill (4:16 - 4:20)
i look i look i hear it scream at me (4:17 - 4:22)
every time i get up there (4:20 - 4:24)
and i can't find it and then you know i (4:22 - 4:25)
go to the isle of (4:24 - 4:27)
armor every day (4:25 - 4:29)
i'll land (4:27 - 4:32)
that one scream at me when you land (4:29 - 4:34)
i can't find that thing and then i go (4:32 - 4:37)
over to the nursery in the wild area and (4:34 - 4:38)
i'm pretty sure somebody's screaming at (4:37 - 4:40)
me over there too (4:38 - 4:41)
that's true (4:40 - 4:44)
and i can't find it so i do this because (4:41 - 4:45)
you purchased the carol tundra (4:44 - 4:48)
yes so i i play these competitions so i (4:45 - 4:51)
can get those birds without having to (4:48 - 4:53)
which i can't find them because i'm not (4:51 - 4:55)
going to go on the internet and ruin the (4:53 - 4:58)
fun of this game (4:55 - 4:58)
i i i will say i also got (4:59 - 5:08)
my dark right ticket in in bdsp (5:03 - 5:11)
i got my arceus flute in bdsp i did (5:08 - 5:13)
those and i have those babies in my (5:11 - 5:15)
luxury ball for my luxury ball (5:13 - 5:18)
collection (5:15 - 5:18)
boy that game (5:18 - 5:22)
is a certainly a thing fantastic (5:20 - 5:26)
nostalgic throwback experience to the (5:22 - 5:29)
original days of two-dimensional pokemon (5:26 - 5:31)
yes no it's not the original experience (5:29 - 5:34)
the old games were actually better (5:31 - 5:34)
jump in a lake you (5:35 - 5:40)
i couldn't they blew up the lake there (5:38 - 5:41)
were magikarp everywhere there were (5:40 - 5:44)
three there's three lakes pick one of (5:41 - 5:45)
the other two go to the one that's up (5:44 - 5:47)
north that's not frozen even though it's (5:45 - 5:49)
in the snow (5:47 - 5:53)
speaking of bdsp uh there was um (5:49 - 5:54)
some discussion (5:53 - 5:58)
from one of the main data miners of the (5:54 - 6:00)
pokemon games (5:58 - 6:03)
uh in regards to possibly why bdsp and (6:00 - 6:04)
pokemon home (6:03 - 6:07)
uh have not happened yet it's been six (6:04 - 6:09)
months i believe (6:07 - 6:12)
since bdsp has come out (6:09 - 6:12)
i did a whole youtube video about that (6:13 - 6:17)
uh well i talked about it on twitch (6:15 - 6:18)
it'll be turned into youtube video i (6:17 - 6:20)
don't have the mental energy to go (6:18 - 6:22)
through that all again plus uh it (6:20 - 6:24)
references a lot of tweets (6:22 - 6:27)
um the too long didn't read (6:24 - 6:28)
is that (6:27 - 6:30)
bdsp and home (6:28 - 6:32)
will probably work i don't see why they (6:30 - 6:33)
would go back on that (6:32 - 6:34)
but it doesn't (6:33 - 6:37)
but the uh (6:34 - 6:40)
it seems that the the way that bdsp is (6:37 - 6:42)
programmed has made it very complicated (6:40 - 6:46)
compared even though other pokemon games (6:42 - 6:49)
so ilka only made the mobile version (6:46 - 6:50)
of pokemon home (6:49 - 6:52)
game freak made the switch version that (6:50 - 6:54)
is also why they are (6:52 - 6:58)
very different in mini systems (6:54 - 7:00)
because the switch version of pokemon (6:58 - 7:03)
home is using a stripped-down version of (7:00 - 7:05)
pokemon sword and shield (7:03 - 7:06)
which is game freak's programming (7:05 - 7:07)
language (7:06 - 7:09)
and arceus and literally every other (7:07 - 7:11)
pokemon game is also main series pokemon (7:09 - 7:13)
game is using gamefreak's programming (7:11 - 7:14)
language (7:13 - 7:18)
and pdsp is using unity (7:14 - 7:18)
now they figured it out (7:21 - 7:26)
niantic can figure it out (7:24 - 7:29)
a real programming company just give me (7:26 - 7:31)
an api what do you mean by real (7:29 - 7:33)
programming company because (7:31 - 7:37)
bdsp is elka's first game and uh (7:33 - 7:40)
they made home (7:37 - 7:40)
what else has niantic made that survived (7:41 - 7:46)
i think has made quite a few games uh (7:46 - 7:52)
pikmin bloom i'm still playing it every (7:50 - 7:53)
day (7:52 - 7:54)
ingress (7:53 - 7:56)
nobody plays that game it died (7:54 - 8:00)
that's not true um (7:56 - 8:00)
if we're gonna say that pokemon home is (8:00 - 8:06)
a more or a better made product than (8:03 - 8:11)
pokemon go or ingress i got news for you (8:06 - 8:11)
what's this because they're charging (8:13 - 8:16)
they're charging 16.99 for pokemon home (8:14 - 8:18)
and that is uh (8:16 - 8:20)
asking a lot (8:18 - 8:22)
once a year (8:20 - 8:22)
yeah niantic is like hey (8:23 - 8:27)
do you want to look at the screen 50 (8:26 - 8:30)
cents (8:27 - 8:30)
90 minutes or 50 cents (8:34 - 8:37)
switching gears here a zoomer is coming (8:37 - 8:43)
to po or it is now here pokemon midnight (8:40 - 8:46)
as of yesterday (8:43 - 8:47)
and people (8:46 - 8:48)
are (8:47 - 8:50)
mixed (8:48 - 8:50)
i felt like every pokemon added to unite (8:51 - 8:56)
came across overpowered except for (8:53 - 8:58)
trevident well (8:56 - 9:03)
and apparently azumarill because (8:58 - 9:03)
uh it says right here at level one and (9:05 - 9:08)
three merrell can learn tackle and (9:06 - 9:09)
bubble (9:08 - 9:11)
when using tackle the aqua mouse pokemon (9:09 - 9:14)
charges forward damages any pokemon (9:11 - 9:16)
along the way (9:14 - 9:19)
um and then when attacking with bubble (9:16 - 9:22)
meryl sprays the bubble cone damaging (9:19 - 9:24)
opposing pokemon in the area and (9:22 - 9:25)
decreasing their movement for a short (9:24 - 9:27)
time (9:25 - 9:30)
uh merrell evolves into azumarel at (9:27 - 9:32)
level five (9:30 - 9:34)
bubble will be upgraded either into (9:32 - 9:37)
whirlpool or aqua tail whirlpool (9:34 - 9:39)
generates four small whirlpools around a (9:37 - 9:40)
zoom roll as it moves one of these (9:39 - 9:42)
whirlpools hits an opposing pokemon the (9:40 - 9:44)
whirlpool deals damage and restores some (9:42 - 9:46)
of azumarill's hp (9:44 - 9:47)
if the whirlpool hits a pokemon on (9:46 - 9:51)
opposing team however even more hp is (9:47 - 9:53)
restored whirlpool can be re upgraded to (9:51 - 9:55)
reduce its cool town (9:53 - 9:57)
and to increase the hp restored (9:55 - 10:00)
bubble can also be uh upgraded to aqua (9:57 - 10:02)
tail this move increases the speed and (10:00 - 10:05)
effect area of azumarill for the next (10:02 - 10:07)
three basic attacks these attacks hit (10:05 - 10:10)
from a distance they deal increased (10:07 - 10:13)
damage restoring azumarill's hp and can (10:10 - 10:15)
ignore the defense stat and shield (10:13 - 10:17)
effects of opposing pokemon when hit (10:15 - 10:20)
when aqua tail is upgraded the zoom (10:17 - 10:21)
rolls next three basic attacks (10:20 - 10:23)
afterwards will also reduce the cooldown (10:21 - 10:25)
of azumarill's moves when those attacks (10:23 - 10:27)
hit an opposing pokemon from a distance (10:25 - 10:30)
at level seven tackle can either upgrade (10:27 - 10:33)
into play rough or water pulse water (10:30 - 10:34)
pulse increases a zoom rolls movement (10:33 - 10:36)
geez like this whole pokemon is like (10:34 - 10:39)
increased speed and like heal (10:36 - 10:40)
uh (10:39 - 10:41)
movement speed for a brief time changes (10:40 - 10:43)
azumarill's next basic attack into a (10:41 - 10:44)
lunge (10:43 - 10:46)
that targets one opposing pokemon from a (10:44 - 10:47)
range (10:46 - 10:50)
um (10:47 - 10:51)
play rough can be upgraded to reduce the (10:50 - 10:53)
cool town and to increase azumarill's (10:51 - 10:55)
movement speed (10:53 - 10:57)
tackle can also be upgraded to water (10:55 - 10:59)
pulse which is when a zoom roll shoots a (10:57 - 11:01)
blasting pulse of water forward and (10:59 - 11:03)
direction when the blast hits it (11:01 - 11:05)
decreases the pokemon's movement speed (11:03 - 11:07)
and deals damage to pokemon in an area (11:05 - 11:10)
around the pokemon that was just hit (11:07 - 11:12)
the blast of water will automatically (11:10 - 11:14)
bounce to another target if one is (11:12 - 11:15)
available including the first pokemon (11:14 - 11:18)
hit blast of water can bounce in (11:15 - 11:21)
between up to three opponents opposing (11:18 - 11:24)
pokemon consecutively (11:21 - 11:27)
and it does not say that restores hp (11:24 - 11:29)
and finally its unite move is called (11:27 - 11:32)
belly bash (11:29 - 11:34)
um why didn't they just call it belly (11:32 - 11:35)
drum (11:34 - 11:37)
or whatever because it acts different (11:35 - 11:39)
i mean if it does damage it can't be (11:37 - 11:41)
belly drum right (11:39 - 11:44)
i guess when azumura unleashes belly (11:41 - 11:45)
bash on an opposing pokemon it pounds (11:44 - 11:47)
the belly three times that's like belly (11:45 - 11:48)
drum (11:47 - 11:50)
creates a shield for itself (11:48 - 11:53)
uh with each pound a zuma loses hp oh (11:50 - 11:55)
that is like billy drum uh in exchange (11:53 - 11:57)
for increased attack azumaril can still (11:55 - 11:59)
move while it's pounding its belly (11:57 - 12:00)
afterwards a zoom roll charges its (11:59 - 12:01)
opponent (12:00 - 12:03)
charges at the opposing pokemon dealing (12:01 - 12:06)
damage and throwing all opposing pokemon (12:03 - 12:08)
it hits while charging (12:06 - 12:11)
so it's kind of like snorlax's thing (12:08 - 12:15)
kind of kind of (12:11 - 12:15)
i have played against and with a lot of (12:17 - 12:22)
the zumeril and (12:20 - 12:25)
has made zero impact really other than (12:22 - 12:27)
like oh there's an azumarill and (12:25 - 12:29)
everybody pretty much ignores it because (12:27 - 12:32)
it doesn't do much (12:29 - 12:32)
you're still lucky to unite though (12:35 - 12:39)
why are you putting time into it if (12:41 - 12:45)
you're not enjoying it greg uh (12:43 - 12:47)
here's the thing (12:45 - 12:49)
when i can i get like a lot of the night (12:47 - 12:51)
if i can play with (12:49 - 12:53)
people i have a great time even when (12:51 - 12:55)
it's a frustrating game if i'm playing (12:53 - 12:57)
solo (12:55 - 13:01)
that game is abysmal i see that uh also (12:57 - 13:05)
if you play at night solo like any time (13:01 - 13:09)
america time 7 p.m on that game is (13:05 - 13:10)
hot (13:09 - 13:11)
garbage (13:10 - 13:14)
if you play around noon the game is (13:11 - 13:17)
brilliant i don't know what it is about (13:14 - 13:18)
day players like all like competitive (13:17 - 13:20)
games versus night players (13:18 - 13:22)
but day players (13:20 - 13:25)
great people i still don't know (13:22 - 13:28)
how this game has been out this long and (13:25 - 13:30)
people still don't go down to (13:28 - 13:32)
dreadnaught i don't (13:30 - 13:34)
understand (13:32 - 13:36)
i made a tick tock about it (13:34 - 13:39)
like two or three months ago right when (13:36 - 13:41)
it was when you know unite was hot (13:39 - 13:43)
i made a tick talk about it was like you (13:41 - 13:45)
know it was one of those it was one of (13:43 - 13:47)
the shower trends and then it said like (13:45 - 13:49)
when your opponent your your your team (13:47 - 13:51)
doesn't rotate to dreadnaught and people (13:49 - 13:53)
in the comments were like i'm never (13:51 - 13:55)
going down to dreadnough rotom is better (13:53 - 13:57)
roto is not bad (13:55 - 14:01)
no no it's true it's not rotating (13:57 - 14:04)
it's not better but it's so frustrating (14:01 - 14:08)
um i will say this though i am masters (14:04 - 14:10)
over 1400 so i'm at the second level of (14:08 - 14:12)
masters now (14:10 - 14:13)
uh (14:12 - 14:15)
levels huh (14:13 - 14:17)
i didn't know there was levels yeah so (14:15 - 14:19)
there's 12 you start at 1200 then you go (14:17 - 14:22)
to 1400 and then you go to 1600 points (14:19 - 14:24)
oh okay okay okay so i'm over 1400 at (14:22 - 14:27)
this point um (14:24 - 14:27)
it (14:29 - 14:32)
it (14:32 - 14:36)
it's interesting because as they've (14:34 - 14:39)
asked they've added more characters (14:36 - 14:42)
they aren't necessarily adding (14:39 - 14:44)
new mechanics like i look at a zoom roll (14:42 - 14:47)
i'm like oh that's that's this pokemon's (14:44 - 14:48)
this that's (14:47 - 14:51)
like they're just rescaled moves that (14:48 - 14:53)
other ones have (14:51 - 14:55)
and i i think that's (14:53 - 14:56)
i think that (14:55 - 14:58)
they add new players to football but (14:56 - 15:02)
they don't change the game of football (14:58 - 15:02)
yeah but the individual players don't (15:03 - 15:08)
have special moves yeah that's that's i (15:05 - 15:10)
mean some do (15:08 - 15:12)
that's not like tell me you don't know (15:10 - 15:14)
sports (15:12 - 15:16)
that's one of the ways what you just (15:14 - 15:18)
said but it's it's (15:16 - 15:19)
i think (15:18 - 15:23)
very they're adding very few (15:19 - 15:23)
new ways that pokemon interact with the (15:25 - 15:30)
world and they're just shuffling around (15:27 - 15:32)
the basic moves they've had and putting (15:30 - 15:34)
them in different configurations like (15:32 - 15:36)
azumarill is very much i'm like oh (15:34 - 15:37)
that's (15:36 - 15:40)
that's like snorlax move and that's (15:37 - 15:41)
that's like (15:40 - 15:44)
zarina's move and that's you know (15:41 - 15:46)
um (15:44 - 15:48)
and that kind of seeing ha because i i (15:46 - 15:52)
felt that way with the last few like (15:48 - 15:52)
i'm i'm curious at what their (15:53 - 16:00)
sort of design scale is as they keep (15:56 - 16:02)
introducing things like when are we (16:00 - 16:03)
actually going to get something that's (16:02 - 16:05)
really super new and somewhat game (16:03 - 16:08)
changing like hoopa is that not hoopa (16:05 - 16:10)
like (16:08 - 16:12)
is the wildest thing they've added and i (16:10 - 16:13)
think they said okay well there's hoopa (16:12 - 16:15)
so we don't have to really do anything (16:13 - 16:18)
strange again for another year until (16:15 - 16:20)
this hoopa stuff is you get one per year (16:18 - 16:23)
once every year because hoopa is (16:20 - 16:25)
mind-boggling just wait till victory is (16:23 - 16:28)
up in there (16:25 - 16:28)
i didn't really hear people to talk (16:29 - 16:34)
about aegis slash that much (16:30 - 16:34)
i mean it's very fun to play but none of (16:34 - 16:41)
its moves are particularly (16:37 - 16:44)
it's an all-arounder uh (16:41 - 16:46)
it's it's a it's actually one of the few (16:44 - 16:47)
all-rounders i think that's really good (16:46 - 16:49)
in jungle (16:47 - 16:50)
uh i mean a lot of all runners like i (16:49 - 16:52)
gotta go to jungle like no you shouldn't (16:50 - 16:54)
uh because agent slash actually has ways (16:52 - 16:56)
of jumping (16:54 - 17:00)
to things so it can act like a speedster (16:56 - 17:03)
is doraledone still broken (17:00 - 17:03)
no (17:03 - 17:06)
no i mean (17:04 - 17:08)
i think everybody now knows what to do (17:06 - 17:11)
with sterling done like the minute you (17:08 - 17:12)
see it stop you're just like i gotta (17:11 - 17:14)
move out of the circle because it has (17:12 - 17:16)
one shot to hit me and i'm out of the (17:14 - 17:17)
circle (17:16 - 17:19)
no not gonna happen (17:17 - 17:21)
um i think i know about circles i play (17:19 - 17:23)
crime rant yeah (17:21 - 17:24)
i think (17:23 - 17:27)
over i think overall the game is mostly (17:24 - 17:28)
balanced there are some things where (17:27 - 17:30)
you're like this pokemon definitely (17:28 - 17:33)
needs to be buffed in a little bit (17:30 - 17:36)
um treven did get a good buff like i i (17:33 - 17:38)
am now able to play trevident pretty (17:36 - 17:40)
well (17:38 - 17:41)
um (17:40 - 17:43)
but i still think there are certain ones (17:41 - 17:47)
that like lucario is still (17:43 - 17:47)
like if you have a lucario lucario alone (17:47 - 17:52)
can still hold an entire lane (17:50 - 17:54)
that's still how somewhat broken that (17:52 - 17:55)
book (17:54 - 17:58)
i would probably wager to guess somebody (17:55 - 17:59)
who's never played league of legends but (17:58 - 18:00)
i would wager i guess there's probably a (17:59 - 18:03)
couple legends that are just (18:00 - 18:05)
very good in league (18:03 - 18:06)
and they're just always good i'm (18:05 - 18:08)
assuming but also i think greedy has (18:06 - 18:10)
like 200. greedon is still very good i (18:08 - 18:14)
mean they did fix the squivet problem of (18:10 - 18:15)
everybody put school of it on your team (18:14 - 18:17)
and school but could move so fast it (18:15 - 18:20)
would run across to the other jungle and (18:17 - 18:22)
clear out their jungle because (18:20 - 18:24)
it had such it has such a speed (18:22 - 18:26)
advantage because it can throw those (18:24 - 18:28)
stupid berries so it would move fast and (18:26 - 18:30)
heal itself and they finally fix that so (18:28 - 18:32)
the problem of like (18:30 - 18:34)
everybody's swarming jungle when you see (18:32 - 18:35)
a greed on the other side because you're (18:34 - 18:37)
like well murder that thing because it's (18:35 - 18:39)
coming over to eat everything (18:37 - 18:40)
uh but (18:39 - 18:42)
uh surprisingly great reading is still (18:40 - 18:45)
an incredibly strong tank i think the (18:42 - 18:47)
biggest (18:45 - 18:49)
question mark like when you get into a (18:47 - 18:51)
match is still if if they have a hoopa (18:49 - 18:53)
and if you have a hoopa there's no (18:51 - 18:56)
predicting (18:53 - 18:58)
going to happen i also still stand by my (18:56 - 19:00)
statement that when you have a lucario (18:58 - 19:02)
play i still say lucario players are (19:00 - 19:05)
playing a different game of unite than (19:02 - 19:07)
everybody else is because i can never (19:05 - 19:09)
predict where they're going to go i'm (19:07 - 19:11)
going bottom lane and two seconds in (19:09 - 19:13)
they are (19:11 - 19:15)
i don't even know where i'm like how did (19:13 - 19:17)
where did you go (19:15 - 19:19)
i was your healer (19:17 - 19:20)
and you are nowhere (19:19 - 19:23)
and i'm alone (19:20 - 19:25)
i think that like the problem of uh (19:23 - 19:27)
unite feeling like a different game in (19:25 - 19:30)
the evening is just a general video game (19:27 - 19:32)
thing because when will and i played (19:30 - 19:33)
destiny and when iron banner would come (19:32 - 19:35)
around (19:33 - 19:37)
iron banner would be a nightmare in the (19:35 - 19:39)
evening but if we played during the (19:37 - 19:41)
afternoon (19:39 - 19:44)
it was like a very enjoyable experience (19:41 - 19:45)
well i think i think there's different (19:44 - 19:48)
reasons for why that can happen like (19:45 - 19:51)
so i mean i'll put in the context right (19:48 - 19:53)
with monster hunter when i play early in (19:51 - 19:54)
the morning and i play early in the (19:53 - 19:55)
morning (19:54 - 19:57)
i get to play with people (19:55 - 19:59)
yes i get to play with people in asia (19:57 - 20:01)
and guess what (19:59 - 20:02)
our colleagues in asia are taking (20:01 - 20:04)
monster hunter seriously they don't mess (20:02 - 20:07)
around if i play in the evening (20:04 - 20:08)
i'm playing with a bunch of american (20:07 - 20:10)
jokers (20:08 - 20:13)
who are out there for the memes and i (20:10 - 20:15)
think with destiny it was more that that (20:13 - 20:18)
game was like super popular everywhere (20:15 - 20:19)
and in the evenings that's when you (20:18 - 20:22)
could get like what everybody could play (20:19 - 20:24)
and iron banner was just like we're just (20:22 - 20:26)
gonna randomly mash people together if (20:24 - 20:28)
they're not on a team and then you're (20:26 - 20:30)
like oh am i gonna end up with whoever (20:28 - 20:32)
who just got off work or but in the (20:30 - 20:34)
afternoon it's more of a select like i (20:32 - 20:36)
want to play destiny (20:34 - 20:39)
when i could be i should be at work or i (20:36 - 20:41)
could be doing something else (20:39 - 20:43)
so probably unite is more like that (20:41 - 20:46)
second yeah i mean circumstances never (20:43 - 20:48)
never do random raids in final fantasy (20:46 - 20:51)
14 on the weekend that is (20:48 - 20:54)
a lesson in madness you do you do all (20:51 - 20:56)
your rating on tuesdays when they reset (20:54 - 20:58)
and although all the good players are (20:56 - 20:59)
like i'm gonna get them done for the (20:58 - 21:03)
week if you wait until a saturday (20:59 - 21:06)
you are going to be in that raid (21:03 - 21:09)
for a couple of hours let's see so that (21:06 - 21:10)
is just the same as destiny because with (21:09 - 21:12)
destiny i think it was like tuesday when (21:10 - 21:13)
the um (21:12 - 21:15)
tuesday was very set yeah but it was (21:13 - 21:18)
also the ultra hard (21:15 - 21:20)
the nightfall stuff nightfall would come (21:18 - 21:21)
out and just like let's get the (21:20 - 21:23)
nightfall done so we don't have to worry (21:21 - 21:25)
about it for the rest of the week oh (21:23 - 21:27)
yeah yeah if you if you waited until (21:25 - 21:29)
like sunday or monday to do night fall (21:27 - 21:30)
you were getting you were getting (21:29 - 21:33)
the stragglers it was almost like like (21:30 - 21:35)
every tuesday steve will and drew just (21:33 - 21:37)
like getting in there getting it done (21:35 - 21:38)
i mean (21:37 - 21:40)
you when you jump in on a weekend to a (21:38 - 21:43)
raid and four people are viewing (21:40 - 21:46)
cutscene you are you are (21:43 - 21:49)
you are in for a sad sad time (21:46 - 21:52)
you're like oh no (21:49 - 21:55)
no no no no no no (21:52 - 21:58)
uh speaking of lucario there is a (21:55 - 22:00)
pokemon tcg lucario v star premium (21:58 - 22:03)
collection that just launched yesterday (22:00 - 22:05)
um (22:03 - 22:06)
which is actually kind of crazy because (22:05 - 22:10)
i uh my target stocked it (22:06 - 22:12)
uh actually will's target stocked it on (22:10 - 22:14)
thursday thank you yes thank you (22:12 - 22:18)
bridgefield target exceptional target (22:14 - 22:21)
do we have to dock (22:18 - 22:21)
you know how big richfield is true (22:23 - 22:28)
um (22:26 - 22:31)
you claim the dino target is your target (22:28 - 22:33)
i know the edina target's very nice that (22:31 - 22:36)
belongs to everyone that is just a gift (22:33 - 22:37)
you know there's no liquor section not (22:36 - 22:39)
that not that i drink you know there's (22:37 - 22:41)
no liquor section in the edina target (22:39 - 22:43)
yeah because edina is a dry city (22:41 - 22:45)
but i've tried i didn't know about this (22:43 - 22:46)
there's nothing (22:45 - 22:48)
either yeah (22:46 - 22:50)
all right so yeah i never have to look (22:48 - 22:52)
for liquor but like irene will like (22:50 - 22:53)
message me she'll be like hey can you (22:52 - 22:54)
bring home a bottle of wine for dinner (22:53 - 22:56)
i'll be like yeah whatever i'll just get (22:54 - 22:57)
you know like a seven dollar bottle of (22:56 - 22:59)
wine but then when i she texted me when (22:57 - 23:01)
i was in edina i was like (22:59 - 23:04)
i don't know where it is and then irene (23:01 - 23:06)
was like why can't you can't find it i (23:04 - 23:08)
was like i don't think they have one (23:06 - 23:09)
here and then i asked somebody and (23:08 - 23:11)
they're like oh the city of edina (23:09 - 23:14)
doesn't let us have a liquor section so (23:11 - 23:16)
this is a this is a wild thing and the (23:14 - 23:18)
reason why like bloomington and (23:16 - 23:21)
bloomington west now exist is because (23:18 - 23:23)
edina passed the no liquor law (23:21 - 23:26)
and then all these hotels (23:23 - 23:28)
that were in edina were like (23:26 - 23:30)
we need to redraw all the city lines (23:28 - 23:31)
because we need to be able to serve (23:30 - 23:34)
liquor in our bar and so the map got (23:31 - 23:37)
real wild as all these people annexed (23:34 - 23:38)
themselves from freedom in edinburgh (23:37 - 23:41)
shrunk to the size that it is now (23:38 - 23:43)
because they passed the no liquor law (23:41 - 23:46)
they became a dry city which is sad for (23:43 - 23:48)
all the uh white so the liquor store (23:46 - 23:51)
drinks street because there's a liquor (23:48 - 23:52)
store down the street that i went to to (23:51 - 23:55)
get a bottle of wine for irene that is (23:52 - 23:59)
officially in bloomington now and not (23:55 - 24:01)
it's like two blocks away yep they (23:59 - 24:03)
redrew all the lines because the hotels (24:01 - 24:06)
were furious (24:03 - 24:09)
yeah weird the the city mapping is wild (24:06 - 24:10)
now because of all these people who are (24:09 - 24:13)
like we're out we're out redraw (24:10 - 24:14)

i think the zashian one is really good (26:01 - 26:05)
uh but i i don't know what current (26:03 - 26:06)
decklists are looking like for the the (26:05 - 26:11)

um (26:33 - 26:36)
and i know the (26:34 - 26:38)
european international (26:36 - 26:41)
challenge or whatever is (26:38 - 26:44)
the happening (26:41 - 26:44)
but or going to happen soon (26:44 - 26:49)
which i think is in germany (26:47 - 26:50)
uh (26:49 - 26:52)
but yeah uh (26:50 - 26:56)
it was it was very weird to see such a (26:52 - 26:58)
full shelf of pokemon cards for the (26:56 - 27:00)
first i mean like i've seen full shelves (26:58 - 27:03)
in the last couple months before but (27:00 - 27:05)
i think it was weird seeing a full shelf (27:03 - 27:08)
being stocked and not have like eight (27:05 - 27:10)
dudes waiting (27:08 - 27:13)
to grab said things (27:10 - 27:15)
um they still had limit five at the (27:13 - 27:17)
target i'm not sure i'd be curious what (27:15 - 27:19)
listeners like how many (27:17 - 27:21)
is their target unlimited is their (27:19 - 27:22)
target limit three is their target limit (27:21 - 27:24)
two (27:22 - 27:26)
uh (27:24 - 27:27)
because last time i was at the edina (27:26 - 27:30)
target it was it was limit two (27:27 - 27:35)
but the the richfield was limit five (27:30 - 27:35)

be available from april 6 to may 3rd (28:28 - 28:32)
sonia will be wearing a special costume (28:30 - 28:35)
and starting in the sub story sonia's (28:32 - 28:37)
party prep the finest tea (28:35 - 28:40)
as part of the broader curious tea party (28:37 - 28:42)
event sonya's party (28:40 - 28:44)
prep the finest tea offers players to (28:42 - 28:45)
earn more gems (28:44 - 28:48)
um zarina is a grass type physical (28:45 - 28:50)
striker sing pair that can dish out a (28:48 - 28:52)
huge amount of damage when the move gage (28:50 - 28:55)
is full see below for the list (28:52 - 28:55)
what does sonia have to do with tea (28:56 - 29:00)
so masters will pick it's (29:01 - 29:05)
wild (29:03 - 29:07)
it's a wild event that's happening right (29:05 - 29:08)
now (29:07 - 29:10)
characters are just really there to tell (29:08 - 29:12)
a story so (29:10 - 29:15)
lily wanted a tea party with polti geist (29:12 - 29:17)
oh boy that's reasonable that is (29:15 - 29:20)
reasonable and so (29:17 - 29:23)
enlisted ingo and emmett and sonia to (29:20 - 29:26)
help throw the big tea party (29:23 - 29:28)
and so england emmett got new butler (29:26 - 29:31)
outfits which are super classy and for (29:28 - 29:33)
some reason (29:31 - 29:36)
sony decided that she wanted uh (29:33 - 29:37)
zarina (29:36 - 29:39)
and then there's a whole another subplot (29:37 - 29:42)
of wallace trying to convince (29:39 - 29:44)
uh (29:42 - 29:46)
lily that the outfit she chose is okay (29:44 - 29:48)
and doesn't need any extra accessories (29:46 - 29:50)
because one thing that one thing that (29:48 - 29:51)
masters does is great is get the (29:50 - 29:53)
characteristics right so every so often (29:51 - 29:55)
lily really worries about what she looks (29:53 - 29:56)
like and what she's wearing (29:55 - 30:00)
and so that happened i pulled (29:56 - 30:03)
this pair i have sonya's arena (30:00 - 30:05)
i mean lily just needs to follow that (30:03 - 30:07)
one piece of classic advice (30:05 - 30:10)
put on what you want to wear and as you (30:07 - 30:13)
head out the door take one thing off yep (30:10 - 30:14)
and if you're wearing a onesie that's a (30:13 - 30:16)
little difficult no (30:14 - 30:18)
it's jewelry and (30:16 - 30:21)
accessories that it applies to (30:18 - 30:23)
accessories not to the clothing what (30:21 - 30:25)
they are also interesting is happening (30:23 - 30:27)
in the game which is very i think very (30:25 - 30:28)
confusing (30:27 - 30:32)
is they're doing a riddle event in (30:28 - 30:32)
conjunction with this tea event (30:33 - 30:38)
and so every day they introduce a new (30:36 - 30:39)
riddle (30:38 - 30:42)
and a you only find out what the riddle (30:39 - 30:47)
is by going into the events tab (30:42 - 30:49)
and then it will say (30:47 - 30:50)
like (30:49 - 30:52)
a sea of sparkling (30:50 - 30:53)
gems and then you have to figure out (30:52 - 30:56)
what you have to do in the game (30:53 - 30:59)
to complete that riddle (30:56 - 31:01)
and (30:59 - 31:01)
it some of them make sense but other (31:02 - 31:05)
ones are like (31:04 - 31:07)
like the blue glittering gem one i think (31:05 - 31:09)
it was the first one everybody gets and (31:07 - 31:11)
it's not clear what they mean or what (31:09 - 31:13)
you're supposed to do (31:11 - 31:14)
um (31:13 - 31:16)
so spoiler turn it off if you don't want (31:14 - 31:17)
to hear (31:16 - 31:18)
but (31:17 - 31:20)
what it's asking you to do is to go into (31:18 - 31:24)
the training area to the evolution gems (31:20 - 31:26)
and (31:24 - 31:28)
do them do the one that gives you the (31:26 - 31:30)
large star cluster one and you should be (31:28 - 31:33)
able to get if you do all three ten (31:30 - 31:36)
stones and that completes the event (31:33 - 31:38)
that one's not clear the other two are (31:36 - 31:39)
pretty clear but that one i know a lot (31:38 - 31:40)
of people are like (31:39 - 31:42)
what (31:40 - 31:44)
i don't understand because most of them (31:42 - 31:46)
are battle oriented and this is (31:44 - 31:49)
collection oriented so (31:46 - 31:51)
go in there go to the event battle the (31:49 - 31:53)
little event thing will light up hit it (31:51 - 31:55)
it will say this is what today's riddle (31:53 - 31:58)
is you have 23 days to solve although (31:55 - 32:00)
all the riddles the rewards are good you (31:58 - 32:02)
get like 200 gems and tickets (32:00 - 32:04)
for each one you solve because i think (32:02 - 32:06)
at the end (32:04 - 32:08)
if you do them all you'll get 6 000 gems (32:06 - 32:10)
which is very nice (32:08 - 32:13)
but (32:10 - 32:13)
it started now (32:13 - 32:17)
just you can go in there (32:15 - 32:18)
collect the gems (32:17 - 32:20)
they're not particularly hard puzzles (32:18 - 32:21)
but (32:20 - 32:24)
some of them just not all of them are (32:21 - 32:26)
battle related so you do have to do (32:24 - 32:30)
other things in the game to complete it (32:26 - 32:30)
i just opened up masters for the first (32:31 - 32:34)
time in like a week (32:32 - 32:37)
i've been slacking (32:34 - 32:37)

likes arena i mean i like zarina too but (32:49 - 32:54)
somebody over there really uh they put (32:52 - 32:57)
zarin on a lot of stuff (32:54 - 32:59)
it's a good pokemon i like it i think a (32:57 - 33:00)
pokemon i can think of another (32:59 - 33:02)
two-legged flower one that deserves a (33:00 - 33:04)
lot of love but who am i that also gets (33:02 - 33:07)
a lot of love (33:04 - 33:10)
yeah as much as serena knows that is not (33:07 - 33:12)
true (33:10 - 33:12)
all right we have um some pokemon go (33:13 - 33:16)

incubators um (38:36 - 38:40)
still against buying incubators but hey (38:38 - 38:42)

america is on the list for (42:09 - 42:14)
minneapolis bloomington (42:11 - 42:15)
so (42:14 - 42:17)
we had that before where we were getting (42:15 - 42:20)
like nine pokeballs from a stop (42:17 - 42:22)
i would be curious of what one of these (42:20 - 42:24)
like meetups actually look like the (42:22 - 42:27)
closest one to us would be (42:24 - 42:32)
chicago at maggie daley park which i'm (42:27 - 42:34)
not sure where that is (42:32 - 42:36)
um (42:34 - 42:36)
i don't know i don't know like maybe so (42:37 - 42:41)
obvious (42:40 - 42:44)
we're still getting bonus items (42:41 - 42:46)
according to the thing on their list yes (42:44 - 42:48)
we have all americans (42:46 - 42:49)
yeah but yeah mall america is still (42:48 - 42:51)
getting bonus items i just don't know (42:49 - 42:52)
what like (42:51 - 42:54)
the official in-person community (42:52 - 42:56)
made-ups look like i think there will be (42:54 - 42:59)
i think from what niantic said (42:56 - 43:01)
there will be a niantic person there (42:59 - 43:03)
handing out masks (43:01 - 43:04)
yeah (43:03 - 43:06)
maybe handing out those uh those (43:04 - 43:07)
professor willow cards because they (43:06 - 43:08)
printed too many of them here's a (43:07 - 43:10)
professor willow card and a mask i'm (43:08 - 43:13)
just curious what (43:10 - 43:15)
that looks like (43:13 - 43:17)
and (43:15 - 43:20)
i mean it's gonna be the same community (43:17 - 43:21)
yeah but did they make a deal with the (43:20 - 43:24)
park to put up some (43:21 - 43:28)
signs uh (43:24 - 43:28)
there's going to be a standy yeah one of (43:28 - 43:34)
the team leaders you won't know which (43:31 - 43:36)
till you get there (43:34 - 43:38)
and you can take a picture with it (43:36 - 43:39)
the only you know what was actually kind (43:38 - 43:42)
of cool is when we first went to (43:39 - 43:45)
that one park greg (43:42 - 43:48)
not the air park the the the long road (43:45 - 43:50)
it's not a victory memorial victory (43:48 - 43:52)
memorial it was actually kind of cool (43:50 - 43:54)
and i hate to say this that there was (43:52 - 43:57)
some pokemon go fans that brought like a (43:54 - 43:58)
whole (43:57 - 44:01)
tent standee thing that you see it like (43:58 - 44:02)
a swamp meet i don't know what those are (44:01 - 44:06)
called a swap meet swap meet (44:02 - 44:07)
or something (44:06 - 44:09)
there is no such thing as a swamp meme i (44:07 - 44:12)
mean unless you're an alligator isn't (44:09 - 44:14)
that where like the people with the like (44:12 - 44:16)
cars go and they park their cars in the (44:14 - 44:17)
mud and then they open the hood no (44:16 - 44:20)
that's a mud jam that's a mud jam that's (44:17 - 44:22)
not a swamp meat a swap meat is when you (44:20 - 44:23)
take your (44:22 - 44:27)
swamp boat and you go out into the bayou (44:23 - 44:29)
and get some moonshine and some crawfish (44:27 - 44:33)
i say swamp meat is crocodile oh yeah (44:29 - 44:34)
delicious (44:33 - 44:36)
when you're playing in all black magic (44:34 - 44:38)
the gathering (44:36 - 44:40)
true (44:38 - 44:40)
but they they had their little tent set (44:40 - 44:45)
up they had uh like a battery station (44:42 - 44:46)
where you could charge your phone they (44:45 - 44:48)
had like free water (44:46 - 44:50)
you know who they were (44:48 - 44:53)
they were it was it was like a very nice (44:50 - 44:55)
community thing to do it reminded me of (44:53 - 44:57)
when the meltdan stuff came out (44:55 - 44:59)
but you know those people (44:57 - 45:00)
yeah (44:59 - 45:02)
but i i'm just saying that the the (45:00 - 45:03)
effort that (45:02 - 45:05)
community members would put in to help (45:03 - 45:07)
other community members (45:05 - 45:10)
that's like a nice gesture (45:07 - 45:12)
so i i would i would like what would be (45:10 - 45:14)
an in-person meetup i guess to me an (45:12 - 45:16)
in-person meetup would be like something (45:14 - 45:18)
like that like have a station (45:16 - 45:22)
where you could get water you could like (45:18 - 45:24)
mingle (45:22 - 45:26)
nobody's like 99 (45:24 - 45:28)
99 of pokemon go players are just gonna (45:26 - 45:29)
look straight down their phone and walk (45:28 - 45:31)
in a circle correct (45:29 - 45:33)
and then you're going to say hey water (45:31 - 45:34)
and they're like i don't need water (45:33 - 45:36)
water will make me use the restroom and (45:34 - 45:37)
i cannot (45:36 - 45:38)
stop (45:37 - 45:39)
this (45:38 - 45:41)
is why mall of america is a great place (45:39 - 45:44)
to play you have multiple bathrooms (45:41 - 45:46)
you have uh (45:44 - 45:48)
most of those bathrooms are trashed (45:46 - 45:52)
what no i actually think you know (45:48 - 45:53)
the last time you're at the mall of (45:52 - 45:55)
america that kid was walking around (45:53 - 45:58)
unattended spitting on the floor you (45:55 - 46:01)
know that was happening you don't you (45:58 - 46:02)
don't go to the bathrooms off the food (46:01 - 46:05)
court those are the worst ones no no no (46:02 - 46:07)
floor two is where the good bathrooms (46:05 - 46:09)
are don't tell anyone this (46:07 - 46:13)
but you just did also floor two (46:09 - 46:16)
look floor q is hot garbage uh uh (46:13 - 46:17)
throughout the thing the only thing good (46:16 - 46:20)
on floor 2 is the bathrooms is the dairy (46:17 - 46:22)
queen (46:20 - 46:22)
there's a dairy queen in the floor too (46:24 - 46:27)
you we were there last time we were (46:25 - 46:30)
there it's the dairy queen orange julius (46:27 - 46:32)
it's right in the corner oh yeah yeah (46:30 - 46:34)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the m m store (46:32 - 46:36)
it's like you don't pay attention to the (46:34 - 46:38)
world around you they're correct (46:36 - 46:41)
correctly mmo's dead that's true you got (46:38 - 46:44)
dairy queen there (46:41 - 46:44)
so (46:45 - 46:50)
was that the last bit of uh pokemon go (46:47 - 46:52)
news (46:50 - 46:53)
i think so i mean (46:52 - 46:55)
and then they announced stuff for civvie (46:53 - 46:57)
uh if you're going to be cool i would (46:55 - 46:59)
love to go to seville i just don't have (46:57 - 47:01)
a thousand dollars to fly to spain (46:59 - 47:02)
now that dude (47:01 - 47:05)
not with that too nor a passport (47:02 - 47:06)
no i have a passport my passport works (47:05 - 47:10)
when are we getting passports will (47:06 - 47:10)
the next time we're at the mall of (47:11 - 47:14)
america and we can go to the old timey (47:12 - 47:17)
picture oh cool (47:14 - 47:19)
there you go (47:17 - 47:19)
all right i talked about this on my (47:21 - 47:23)
twitch stream (47:22 - 47:25)
uh we can talk about it here real quick (47:23 - 47:25)
uh (47:25 - 47:28)
for whatever reason (47:25 - 47:28)
what niantic said to me was they didn't (47:29 - 47:33)
think this was that big of a deal so (47:31 - 47:35)
there they put it on their at niantic (47:33 - 47:38)
help twitter not the niantic twitter not (47:35 - 47:39)
the pokemon go twitter this is what the (47:38 - 47:41)
tweet says (47:39 - 47:42)
it says trainers (47:41 - 47:45)
where we are tuning the opportunity to (47:42 - 47:48)
obtain rare candy in the game rare candy (47:45 - 47:51)
chances will slightly decrease in rating (47:48 - 47:53)
and slightly increase in go battle (47:51 - 47:54)
league (47:53 - 47:56)
you can also now (47:54 - 47:58)
obtain rare candy in gifts hashtag (47:56 - 48:01)
pokemon go (47:58 - 48:01)
uh and hold on what comes after tepig (48:03 - 48:10)
but before emboar (48:07 - 48:10)
after ted peg before emboar yeah uh that (48:11 - 48:17)
is uh pig night (48:15 - 48:19)
one of them just showed up outside my (48:17 - 48:21)
front door can i take three pictures of (48:19 - 48:23)
him take three pictures yes that would (48:21 - 48:26)
work am i getting lucky (48:23 - 48:26)
pig knight you were right (48:28 - 48:32)
nope i got an execute (48:35 - 48:39)
womp (48:39 - 48:42)
um so (48:40 - 48:44)
uh like everything in the pokemon go (48:42 - 48:47)
community people are upset (48:44 - 48:47)
and and i feel like (48:47 - 48:51)
i feel like that like uh over the years (48:52 - 48:58)
the (48:57 - 49:00)
it was it was a slow burn for a lot of i (48:58 - 49:02)
think main series pokemon fans i think (49:00 - 49:06)
there's there's a there's an obvious (49:02 - 49:08)
divide (49:06 - 49:10)
between (49:08 - 49:13)
gen 5 and gen 6 fans there's like this (49:10 - 49:14)
bitterness that happened when pokemon (49:13 - 49:17)
went from 2d to 3d (49:14 - 49:19)
oh and yeah and (49:17 - 49:21)
for whatever reason there's this there's (49:19 - 49:23)
this part of the (49:21 - 49:25)
hardcore fans (49:23 - 49:27)
of main series pokemon games that just (49:25 - 49:30)
like everything after gen 5 is is (49:27 - 49:32)
garbage (49:30 - 49:34)
and it's it's because because of the 3d (49:32 - 49:35)
because they're not sprites because of (49:34 - 49:37)
the experience share because every time (49:35 - 49:40)
i everything after me no longer being a (49:37 - 49:42)
child is hot garbage now that i have (49:40 - 49:44)
things to compare it to this isn't as (49:42 - 49:46)
good as when i was an innocent child (49:44 - 49:48)
that didn't know up from down (49:46 - 49:51)
and and you (49:48 - 49:51)
and you get to something like sword and (49:52 - 49:55)
shield and then every everything they do (49:53 - 49:58)
is like nitpicked right like oh my god (49:55 - 50:00)
like dynamaxx is done oh those trees are (49:58 - 50:02)
so bad (50:00 - 50:05)
look at that water it's garbage (50:02 - 50:09)
water anymore shiny hunting is whatever (50:05 - 50:11)
and i feel like we're we've been at that (50:09 - 50:13)
point in pogo for a while (50:11 - 50:15)
because i read this (50:13 - 50:16)
and i actually think this is a great (50:15 - 50:20)
change and it's i'm actually like (50:16 - 50:22)
like the incense thing was dumb the (50:20 - 50:24)
changing from (50:22 - 50:26)
six hours to three hours for community (50:24 - 50:29)
day dumb you could be like well i can (50:26 - 50:31)
see the reasons why niantic wants to do (50:29 - 50:32)
it diantic wants to do this to force you (50:31 - 50:34)
to go outside niantic wants to do you to (50:32 - 50:37)
do this to play together (50:34 - 50:37)
this seems great like i it's weird that (50:38 - 50:43)
people are complaining so i'm going to (50:41 - 50:45)
reread the tweet again it says we're (50:43 - 50:47)
we're tuning the opportunity to obtain (50:45 - 50:49)
rare candy in the game rare candy (50:47 - 50:51)
chances will be slightly decreased in (50:49 - 50:53)
rating and slightly increased in go (50:51 - 50:55)
battle league you can now obtain rare (50:53 - 50:57)
candy in gifts so let's just ignore that (50:55 - 50:59)
last sentence you can obtain rare candy (50:57 - 51:00)
and gifts (50:59 - 51:02)
so they're slightly decreasing and (51:00 - 51:03)
rating we don't know exactly what that (51:02 - 51:04)
is (51:03 - 51:05)
and they're going to slightly increase (51:04 - 51:08)
it and go battle league (51:05 - 51:11)
rating costs money (51:08 - 51:13)
like yeah you can rate once a day for (51:11 - 51:14)
free (51:13 - 51:16)
but if it but (51:14 - 51:21)
rating is the main way to get rare candy (51:16 - 51:25)
and there is no other way i mean like (51:21 - 51:26)
yeah go battle league will give you like (51:25 - 51:28)
one every five battles or whatever but (51:26 - 51:31)
like five battles is incredibly time (51:28 - 51:35)
consuming compared to one raid (51:31 - 51:38)
and the raid usually gave (51:35 - 51:40)
i would say a raid gives what like four (51:38 - 51:42)
to five rare candy (51:40 - 51:44)
and i'm i don't know what the new rate (51:42 - 51:46)
is they say slightly decrease so let's (51:44 - 51:48)
just pretend (51:46 - 51:49)
that (51:48 - 51:50)
um (51:49 - 51:52)
a raid gives five and now it's only (51:50 - 51:53)
gonna give four (51:52 - 51:54)
and (51:53 - 51:57)
a go battle league gives one every five (51:54 - 51:58)
battles but now they're going to give (51:57 - 52:01)
two every five battles (51:58 - 52:04)
i don't see how (52:01 - 52:06)
giving (52:04 - 52:09)
free to play players like because go (52:06 - 52:10)
battle league is completely free i'm (52:09 - 52:12)
going to say completely free with air (52:10 - 52:14)
quotes because you do need like (52:12 - 52:16)
you do need to play a lot you do you (52:14 - 52:17)
need to have like (52:16 - 52:18)
decent pokemon (52:17 - 52:20)
to like fit those things you do have to (52:18 - 52:23)
probably google to be like what teams (52:20 - 52:24)
are met like you do have to put a little (52:23 - 52:27)
bit of work into it but for all (52:24 - 52:29)
intents and purposes go battle league is (52:27 - 52:32)
free there is no way around raiding for (52:29 - 52:34)
free unless you're doing seven raids a (52:32 - 52:36)
week one a day yeah you can do one a day (52:34 - 52:38)
you get one free one a day but you can (52:36 - 52:41)
do 20 battles of go battle league at no (52:38 - 52:42)
cost (52:41 - 52:45)
i think it's 20 battles a day (52:42 - 52:47)
i mean an opportunity cost building (52:45 - 52:49)
costs because do you get the rewards if (52:47 - 52:52)
you lose (52:49 - 52:52)
um no (52:53 - 52:56)
well (52:55 - 52:58)
i'm never gonna win a go badly but the (52:56 - 53:01)
real question is (52:58 - 53:03)
who cares about rare candy you don't get (53:01 - 53:04)
rewards if you lose the raid your (53:03 - 53:07)
friends won't let you use them (53:04 - 53:09)
anyways when you want to yeah right you (53:07 - 53:11)
don't use your candy even though you're (53:09 - 53:14)
sitting on 267 rare candies in your bag (53:11 - 53:16)
your friend's like no you can't use (53:14 - 53:17)
those and then you're like well why do i (53:16 - 53:18)
have them (53:17 - 53:21)
i think um (53:18 - 53:21)
they're (53:24 - 53:27)
like i said you you can't you can do 20 (53:25 - 53:29)
battles a day and go battle league at no (53:27 - 53:30)
cost (53:29 - 53:33)
maybe 25. you can only do one rate a day (53:30 - 53:36)
for free you have to spend money to raid (53:33 - 53:38)
and that is really the only way you (53:36 - 53:42)
could have gotten mass rare candies (53:38 - 53:44)
over the last what (53:42 - 53:48)
five years four four and a half years (53:44 - 53:49)
um (53:48 - 53:53)
it rare candy was a very (53:49 - 53:55)
pay to get (53:53 - 53:57)
item in the game (53:55 - 53:58)
i think you're you're looking at it from (53:57 - 54:01)
a perspective of somebody who plays a (53:58 - 54:02)
lot because obviously i have a ton of (54:01 - 54:05)
rare candies and i don't pay for raids (54:02 - 54:06)
ever (54:05 - 54:08)
um and the thing is it's like i could (54:06 - 54:12)
use my one free raid every day to do a (54:08 - 54:13)
one star (54:12 - 54:15)
raid it's like an easy one that i can do (54:13 - 54:17)
myself get a rare candy you would (54:15 - 54:19)
probably get like one rare candy if (54:17 - 54:20)
you're lucky because the the five star (54:19 - 54:23)
rates give you like four to five well (54:20 - 54:24)
are they going to make it so that one (54:23 - 54:26)
stars give none (54:24 - 54:28)
i don't know it doesn't say that (54:26 - 54:30)
but i mean it's like i can you know get (54:28 - 54:31)
get the dribble of rare candies without (54:30 - 54:34)
having to do go battle league which is (54:31 - 54:35)
up in the air because i can't really (54:34 - 54:39)
determine whether i'm gonna win or not (54:35 - 54:42)
yeah but go go battle league is (54:39 - 54:42)
like once once you have a team for go (54:44 - 54:47)
battle league like i have the same team (54:46 - 54:49)
for go battle league since the start of (54:47 - 54:51)
go battle league it's a it's a (54:49 - 54:54)
wigglytuff a skarmory and a vigoroth (54:51 - 54:57)
and it's for great you had to use meltan (54:54 - 54:59)
no you don't use it (54:57 - 55:01)
mel metal for team rocket male metal is (54:59 - 55:04)
a good hard counter against teamwork (55:01 - 55:04)
and any it's not like yes i do (55:05 - 55:10)
there's i'm not going to sugarcoat that (55:08 - 55:12)
you do have to spend stardust and you do (55:10 - 55:14)
have to (55:12 - 55:16)
power up pokemon to get a gbl thing (55:14 - 55:19)
ready (55:16 - 55:19)
i feel like almost all these complaints (55:19 - 55:24)
are i don't play go battle league so (55:21 - 55:26)
this is bad yes i agree that is my (55:24 - 55:28)
complaint and i don't want to play go (55:26 - 55:31)
battle league (55:28 - 55:31)
but even in that case it's like (55:33 - 55:38)
okay those are those are still players (55:37 - 55:40)
too they're still trying to enjoy the (55:38 - 55:43)
game it's still a mechanic of the game (55:40 - 55:43)
like the whole the whole the the game (55:44 - 55:48)
world as a whole is still the game world (55:46 - 55:49)
as a whole (55:48 - 55:52)
whether you do everything or not (55:49 - 55:55)
like in destiny you can be like (55:52 - 55:56)
i don't play (55:55 - 55:59)
iron banner i don't play (55:56 - 56:01)
trials of osiris (55:59 - 56:04)
but all the guns in destiny have to be (56:01 - 56:05)
balanced (56:04 - 56:07)
for every type of play whether that's a (56:05 - 56:09)
raid a strike (56:07 - 56:10)
a crucible (56:09 - 56:13)
trials of osiris (56:10 - 56:13)
so let's say like you absolutely hate go (56:14 - 56:18)
battle league (56:16 - 56:20)
that that's your complaint i feel like (56:18 - 56:22)
then you're missing the last sentence of (56:20 - 56:25)
you can now obtain rare candy in gifts (56:22 - 56:28)
how is it oh i didn't hear that credible (56:25 - 56:30)
change i like that one i do lots of (56:28 - 56:32)
gifts (56:30 - 56:35)
so again yes (56:32 - 56:37)
slight rare candy decrease in rating (56:35 - 56:40)
something that costs money (56:37 - 56:41)
to do (56:40 - 56:43)
opening 20 gifts and sending a hundred (56:41 - 56:45)
gifts a day (56:43 - 56:47)
costs you no money (56:45 - 56:48)
wait if you're sending 100 gifts a day (56:47 - 56:50)
how come i don't get a gift from you (56:48 - 56:51)
every day (56:50 - 56:52)
excuse me (56:51 - 56:54)
100 gifts a day hey i sent you a gift (56:52 - 56:56)
yesterday (56:54 - 56:57)
dubious (56:56 - 56:59)
i think i put uh (56:57 - 57:01)
don't put stickers on gifts you send to (56:59 - 57:03)
me i don't look at them stop wasting (57:01 - 57:06)
your time and your stickers sorry (57:03 - 57:08)
except my sticker i am i accept it and (57:06 - 57:10)
with the ignorance of my eyes being (57:08 - 57:13)
blind to whatever you stuck on there (57:10 - 57:15)
i think and maybe maybe greg can speak (57:13 - 57:17)
to this but like there's this there's (57:15 - 57:19)
there is something called a (57:17 - 57:21)
there is a game economy and i feel like (57:19 - 57:23)
it's not talked about but game economies (57:21 - 57:25)
exist in every game i think sword and (57:23 - 57:27)
shield has a great game economy i think (57:25 - 57:29)
brilliant diamond shining pearl has a (57:27 - 57:31)
terrible game economy and the game (57:29 - 57:34)
economy ranges from (57:31 - 57:36)
the currencies that are in the game (57:34 - 57:40)
whether that's money or watts or uh (57:36 - 57:44)
battle points or these dyna crystals (57:40 - 57:44)
so how much time am i putting in for (57:45 - 57:49)
said reward and can said reward be (57:47 - 57:51)
cashed in for these other things and (57:49 - 57:53)
these other things (57:51 - 57:55)
and (57:53 - 57:56)
and there's always the conversation of (57:55 - 57:58)
nerfs and buffs (57:56 - 58:00)
and if we look at a game like i'm going (57:58 - 58:02)
to use apex legends characters get (58:00 - 58:03)
nerfed (58:02 - 58:04)
and then characters get people say (58:03 - 58:07)
pokemon unite everybody it's a pokemon (58:04 - 58:09)
game okay we'll do we'll do pokemon (58:07 - 58:10)
unite same thing literally any (58:09 - 58:12)
competitive game (58:10 - 58:13)
they'll nerf a character and then (58:12 - 58:14)
they'll buff another character and then (58:13 - 58:16)
people will will complain that their (58:14 - 58:18)
character got nerfed (58:16 - 58:20)
and the the standard complaint is (58:18 - 58:22)
instead of nerfing characters just make (58:20 - 58:24)
other characters better (58:22 - 58:26)
but at that point you start to introduce (58:24 - 58:29)
a power creep (58:26 - 58:32)
and even characters that get nerfed (58:29 - 58:35)
good example would be lucario are still (58:32 - 58:36)
very good (58:35 - 58:38)
because they're doing specific things (58:36 - 58:40)
now they are clearly playing a different (58:38 - 58:42)
game too (58:40 - 58:44)
those little card players are carrying (58:42 - 58:45)
their whole different they have a (58:44 - 58:47)
different ui they have to have a (58:45 - 58:49)
different map (58:47 - 58:50)
because i don't know what map they are (58:49 - 58:52)
using because you know that would be an (58:50 - 58:54)
awesome game if there was like some game (58:52 - 58:56)
where like everybody's playing a (58:54 - 58:58)
different game and yet you still see (58:56 - 59:01)
what the other people are doing (58:58 - 59:01)
now (59:02 - 59:05)
the nerf and buff doesn't really make (59:03 - 59:06)
sense in the sen like nerfing and (59:05 - 59:08)
buffing for power creep does make sense (59:06 - 59:10)
in that instance (59:08 - 59:13)
and if you want to look at a game (59:10 - 59:16)
that had uh in my opinion a really bad (59:13 - 59:18)
power creep (59:16 - 59:20)
i just googled the words pokemon trading (59:18 - 59:22)
card game (59:20 - 59:23)
and go back about 25 years when the (59:22 - 59:26)
highest hp was 120 (59:23 - 59:28)
and look at the hp of pokemon now this (59:26 - 59:31)
is protected 9 000. this morning (59:28 - 59:34)
morphe union i held up is like 330 or (59:31 - 59:37)
something in the same like that (59:34 - 59:39)
but also but (59:37 - 59:41)
attacks due like 5 billion so i don't (59:39 - 59:42)
know what you're complaining about (59:41 - 59:44)
yeah yeah yeah so (59:42 - 59:48)
power creep is a real thing and (59:44 - 59:49)
there (59:48 - 59:51)
obviously there's no like power creep in (59:49 - 59:53)
like the rare candy situation but there (59:51 - 59:55)
is an economy in a rare candy situation (59:53 - 59:57)
and the only other example i can i can (59:55 - 59:59)
maybe bring up that maybe players don't (59:57 - 60:00)
think about (59:59 - 60:03)
is in in final fantasy 14 you can get (60:00 - 60:05)
greg's attention here (60:03 - 60:08)
or in a game like world of warcraft (60:05 - 60:11)
there is uh in final fantasy 14 you have (60:08 - 60:13)
armor and weapons and your weapons and (60:11 - 60:14)
armor can degrade (60:13 - 60:16)
and if you do like maybe two to three (60:14 - 60:19)
hours of playing and not not like (60:16 - 60:20)
standing there dancing which you could (60:19 - 60:22)
easily spend two to three hours but like (60:20 - 60:23)
going through the dungeons and doing the (60:22 - 60:25)
raids and out in the world if you do (60:23 - 60:27)
like two to three hours of that your (60:25 - 60:29)
armor will be degraded and you have to (60:27 - 60:31)
go to a store person and hit the button (60:29 - 60:32)
that says repair all armor and it's (60:31 - 60:34)
usually like a thousand gil gil is the (60:32 - 60:35)
money in the game (60:34 - 60:36)
and (60:35 - 60:39)
that mechanic in itself is not fun it's (60:36 - 60:41)
a bad mechanic like every two to three (60:39 - 60:43)
hours i have to walk it's it's not it's (60:41 - 60:45)
just tedious like i gotta remember to go (60:43 - 60:46)
to a person i gotta talk to them they (60:45 - 60:48)
gotta repair my armor and if you forget (60:46 - 60:50)
to repair your armor and you're in a (60:48 - 60:52)
dungeon or something you'll do like less (60:50 - 60:54)
damage you'll take more damage it's it's (60:52 - 60:56)
not a fun mechanic (60:54 - 60:58)
but the reason that exists is to (60:56 - 61:01)
actually balance the game economy so (60:58 - 61:02)
um (61:01 - 61:05)
if they have no if the game has no way (61:02 - 61:06)
to (61:05 - 61:10)
get rid of gill (61:06 - 61:13)
then the gill gets out of control and (61:10 - 61:15)
then breaks that game economy now you (61:13 - 61:17)
might be saying well what's a thousand (61:15 - 61:19)
gill from me that's like i have six (61:17 - 61:20)
million gil what's a thousand gil this (61:19 - 61:22)
is just tedious i have to go there (61:20 - 61:25)
if final fantasy 14 has 10 million (61:22 - 61:29)
active players i think it has more 25 (61:25 - 61:31)
let's just say that (61:29 - 61:33)
10 million people log in and 10 million (61:31 - 61:35)
people log in a day and they play five (61:33 - 61:36)
hours the means are probably repairing (61:35 - 61:39)
their armor twice which is 2 000 gil (61:36 - 61:41)
times 10 million players (61:39 - 61:43)
that's a lot of guild that's getting (61:41 - 61:45)
removed from the game (61:43 - 61:47)
and so literally the only reason that (61:45 - 61:48)
exists (61:47 - 61:49)
is to (61:48 - 61:53)
balance that game economy (61:49 - 61:56)
so coming back to pokemon go (61:53 - 61:58)
rare candy is one of the best items in (61:56 - 61:59)
the game (61:58 - 62:01)
and they're trying to balance the game (61:59 - 62:03)
economy i'm not saying that niantic is (62:01 - 62:06)
balancing the game economy well here (62:03 - 62:09)
because we don't have exact numbers (62:06 - 62:11)
but for them to be like hey (62:09 - 62:13)
we're giving you rare candy and gifts a (62:11 - 62:16)
completely free way to get rare candy (62:13 - 62:18)
and we're slightly decreasing it from a (62:16 - 62:21)
very paid way to get rare candy (62:18 - 62:22)
we're also putting some more rare candy (62:21 - 62:25)
over here for these players to reward (62:22 - 62:27)
them (62:25 - 62:28)
you might be mad that you don't play go (62:27 - 62:30)
battle again the only thing you do is (62:28 - 62:33)
spend money in raid but overall when i (62:30 - 62:36)
read this this is an incredibly healthy (62:33 - 62:38)
change to a game economy (62:36 - 62:41)
that benefits more players than it hurts (62:38 - 62:43)
the the people it's quote unquote (62:41 - 62:44)
hurting (62:43 - 62:47)
are the people spending all the money (62:44 - 62:48)
and if anything if we learn from the (62:47 - 62:50)
last two weeks of conversation with (62:48 - 62:54)
niantic stop giving the money (62:50 - 62:54)
i mean you're not you're not wrong i i (62:54 - 62:58)
will say that (62:57 - 63:01)
the armored degradation has a different (62:58 - 63:02)
purpose like (63:01 - 63:04)
getting rid of balancing out the game (63:02 - 63:07)
economy is not its main function but it (63:04 - 63:09)
is a function of (63:07 - 63:11)
armor degrading (63:09 - 63:12)
um (63:11 - 63:13)
but yeah i mean (63:12 - 63:15)
overall (63:13 - 63:17)
i don't (63:15 - 63:19)
i think the way they word these things (63:17 - 63:22)
makes people think i have to do a thing (63:19 - 63:25)
that i don't want to do (63:22 - 63:28)
to to still get what i was getting (63:25 - 63:30)
before and they buried the lead they (63:28 - 63:31)
should have put the gifts up front right (63:30 - 63:33)
gifts should be first (63:31 - 63:35)
rare candy now available in gifts (63:33 - 63:38)
and reducing it in raids increasing it (63:35 - 63:39)
and i don't want to get too mad at them (63:38 - 63:42)
for like they could have left off that (63:39 - 63:44)
they are dropping it in rates and it (63:42 - 63:46)
would have taken a bunch of people a (63:44 - 63:48)
long time to notice that the average (63:46 - 63:50)
data miners that would have gotten the (63:48 - 63:52)
yelled out for not communicating but (63:50 - 63:54)
that's like a double expectation so (63:52 - 63:55)
i won't say like it would have been (63:54 - 63:57)
better to leave that off but (63:55 - 63:59)
um (63:57 - 64:01)
as the person that's sitting on 300 rare (63:59 - 64:03)
candies (64:01 - 64:05)
uh (64:03 - 64:07)
in the pve and even in raids you don't (64:05 - 64:10)
really need rare candies as much as you (64:07 - 64:12)
don't need it in the battle league where (64:10 - 64:15)
correct those levels and cps (64:12 - 64:17)
matter yeah i mean to be completely fair (64:15 - 64:20)
like if you're just raiding hardcore (64:17 - 64:22)
you don't ever need rare candy right so (64:20 - 64:23)
they're shifting it (64:22 - 64:25)
they're shifting it (64:23 - 64:27)
but think of it this way if it if you're (64:25 - 64:29)
upset that they're shifting it to the (64:27 - 64:31)
people who actually (64:29 - 64:33)
have a lot of use for them they're (64:31 - 64:36)
shifting it to the players (64:33 - 64:37)
that (64:36 - 64:40)
see more benefit from getting rare candy (64:37 - 64:42)
and shifting it away from players who (64:40 - 64:44)
also don't get a lot of benefit from (64:42 - 64:46)
having a lot of our candy which is (64:44 - 64:49)
raiders you just don't need it (64:46 - 64:50)
and and that is very true because right (64:49 - 64:52)
hardcore raiders will (64:50 - 64:56)
do a hundred raids for a single pokemon (64:52 - 64:58)
and then be like okay i got the perfect (64:56 - 65:00)
i got the perfect the perfect version of (64:58 - 65:02)
it put it in a box done right (65:00 - 65:04)
and (65:02 - 65:06)
they've shifted also to compensate for (65:04 - 65:10)
raiders they shifted to (65:06 - 65:11)
gifts (65:10 - 65:13)
that you get from pending spinning the (65:11 - 65:14)
bokeh shops that you would do when (65:13 - 65:16)
you're doing the raids like they are (65:14 - 65:18)
just shifting it to the people that (65:16 - 65:19)
would use it (65:18 - 65:22)
more that get a benefit from actively (65:19 - 65:24)
using it and (65:22 - 65:26)
if you are a hardcore raider and you (65:24 - 65:28)
never go battle league you don't have a (65:26 - 65:31)
lot to stand on because i guarantee (65:28 - 65:32)
you are just sitting on rare candies (65:31 - 65:34)
you're just sitting on them they are (65:32 - 65:37)
eating up space in your bag because you (65:34 - 65:40)
just don't need it that often and your (65:37 - 65:41)
friend won't let you use them and your (65:40 - 65:43)
friend won't let you use it or will (65:41 - 65:45)
judge you so heavily that you are afraid (65:43 - 65:47)
to use them in their presence well (65:45 - 65:48)
rating (65:47 - 65:50)
like look if you if if the thing about (65:48 - 65:53)
pogo you like is (65:50 - 65:55)
rating and for whatever reason you like (65:53 - 65:57)
powering pokemon up to 40 and then you (65:55 - 65:59)
like to grind out the xl candy and grind (65:57 - 66:01)
them up to 50 (65:59 - 66:04)
which i'm on the level 46 to 47 tasks (66:01 - 66:06)
and getting a pokemon to getting a (66:04 - 66:08)
pokemon to 50 is not difficult it's just (66:06 - 66:10)
tedious like (66:08 - 66:12)
i want pikachu at level 50. why is i'm (66:10 - 66:14)
not going to use them in raids it's just (66:12 - 66:16)
i have so much pikachu candy that this (66:14 - 66:17)
is the easiest one i can get to 50. how (66:16 - 66:20)
do i get more xl candy i just make (66:17 - 66:22)
pikachu my buddy and i just walk that's (66:20 - 66:23)
it (66:22 - 66:24)
and then if i see pikachu in the wild i (66:23 - 66:26)
get excited because i like i get six (66:24 - 66:28)
extra candy and i pin up it and like (66:26 - 66:31)
that's it like if you want to walk with (66:28 - 66:33)
the dialga (66:31 - 66:35)
it's more tedious because pikachu i (66:33 - 66:36)
think is 1k (66:35 - 66:38)
to get a candy i think diago's 10k and (66:36 - 66:41)
like ev is like 5k or whatever (66:38 - 66:43)
um (66:41 - 66:45)
but as somebody who (66:43 - 66:48)
has done over a thousand legendary raids (66:45 - 66:52)
and over a thousand non-legendary raids (66:48 - 66:54)
i've done a lot of raids maybe not as (66:52 - 66:56)
much as some of the whales out there who (66:54 - 66:57)
raid (66:56 - 67:01)
you know seven eight times a day (66:57 - 67:02)
i (67:01 - 67:04)
i don't even look at my t i just (67:02 - 67:07)
whatever six you pick that's fine (67:04 - 67:08)
whatever six you pick i'm not even gonna (67:07 - 67:10)
look at the screen (67:08 - 67:11)
the rewards are gonna come through i'm (67:10 - 67:14)
gonna i'm gonna move on i don't need (67:11 - 67:16)
to (67:14 - 67:18)
like maybe if you lived in a in the (67:16 - 67:19)
middle of nowhere and there's only two (67:18 - 67:21)
of you and you need like max pokemon to (67:19 - 67:25)
do a top of boolu i get it (67:21 - 67:26)
sure (67:25 - 67:27)
like (67:26 - 67:28)
you're already we've talked about this (67:27 - 67:30)
before you're already in disadvantage (67:28 - 67:31)
disadvantage (67:30 - 67:32)
like if you live on a if you live on a (67:31 - 67:34)
pokestop you're at a huge discipline (67:32 - 67:35)
you'll never you'll never have to buy (67:34 - 67:37)
pokeballs in the entire world because (67:35 - 67:39)
you literally live in a pokestop um (67:37 - 67:40)
but (67:39 - 67:42)
again (67:40 - 67:44)
slightly like (67:42 - 67:46)
but even in that situation (67:44 - 67:49)
even in the situation of you need to max (67:46 - 67:51)
out because you're in (67:49 - 67:54)
a rural area the change to gifts helps (67:51 - 67:57)
you immensely because you can get 20 (67:54 - 68:00)
gifts from me (67:57 - 68:00)
well yeah you can get well yes you're (68:00 - 68:05)
sending gifts you use gifts and (68:02 - 68:08)
you receiving gifts (68:05 - 68:10)
benefits you because you can make (68:08 - 68:12)
friends anywhere in the world and they (68:10 - 68:13)
can send you gifts (68:12 - 68:15)
uh and that is actually one of the few (68:13 - 68:16)
things that's like (68:15 - 68:18)
niantic actually does to build a (68:16 - 68:20)
community and make you have friends in (68:18 - 68:22)
game or you can do the mistake that i do (68:20 - 68:24)
sometimes and say hey i need one friend (68:22 - 68:26)
and i post my code to twitter and then i (68:24 - 68:29)
give one simple instruction (68:26 - 68:31)
tell me what your name is in game and (68:29 - 68:34)
reply to this and then i get like 50 (68:31 - 68:36)
unknown people none of you are getting (68:34 - 68:38)
accepted because you didn't follow my (68:36 - 68:40)
instructions but it's (68:38 - 68:42)
it it actually helps you if you're in an (68:40 - 68:44)
outer area that you can get it from (68:42 - 68:46)
gifts that you don't have to try to (68:44 - 68:48)
spend money in remote raids and you (68:46 - 68:50)
don't have to like wait the one day for (68:48 - 68:53)
the one raid in the one water tower (68:50 - 68:55)
that's in the middle of the city that's (68:53 - 68:57)
close by like (68:55 - 68:59)
even for those people this is a benefit (68:57 - 69:03)
by switching that out it is (68:59 - 69:03)
it is in the nature of everybody to (69:03 - 69:07)
complain it is the nature to look at (69:05 - 69:08)
something when they're saying they're (69:07 - 69:10)
decreasing something to feel like you're (69:08 - 69:13)
taking something away from me (69:10 - 69:15)
and it's really easy to get locked in (69:13 - 69:18)
that mindset but i think if you look at (69:15 - 69:20)
it overall (69:18 - 69:22)
they are actually spreading it out in a (69:20 - 69:26)
more balanced way that will benefit (69:22 - 69:27)
everybody (69:26 - 69:30)
more (69:27 - 69:30)
yeah i there that was a thing in destiny (69:30 - 69:35)
2 where um well destiny destiny as well (69:32 - 69:38)
where when they re when they release the (69:35 - 69:41)
trials of osiris which is an incredible (69:38 - 69:44)
way super competitive 3v3 and they put (69:41 - 69:47)
specific emblems and specific weapons (69:44 - 69:49)
behind trials of osiris (69:47 - 69:51)
and there was a bunch of destiny players (69:49 - 69:54)
that were like i hate pvp (69:51 - 69:56)
and i've collected every emblem and (69:54 - 69:58)
every gun in this game and now you're (69:56 - 69:59)
telling me bungie (69:58 - 70:02)
i can't do that anymore (69:59 - 70:04)
and bungie was like (70:02 - 70:06)
this is something we were really (70:04 - 70:07)
passionate about this is a part of a (70:06 - 70:10)
game that that a lot of our players like (70:07 - 70:12)
we encourage you to meet up with other (70:10 - 70:13)
players (70:12 - 70:16)
get good like get good at people like (70:13 - 70:18)
and try to enjoy this experience we're (70:16 - 70:20)
creating (70:18 - 70:22)
for for better or for worse niantic (70:20 - 70:24)
wants you (70:22 - 70:26)
to play go battle league (70:24 - 70:29)
battling is a part of the pokemon (70:26 - 70:31)
universe that is what you do in the main (70:29 - 70:34)
series game we can only hope that go (70:31 - 70:37)
battle league gets better (70:34 - 70:38)
um (70:37 - 70:41)
i have experienced joy from the fun (70:38 - 70:43)
little cups they do like the love cup or (70:41 - 70:46)
the jungle cup like these these are very (70:43 - 70:48)
like the jungle cup you only needed 500 (70:46 - 70:50)
cp (70:48 - 70:51)
like very you didn't need 1500 you (70:50 - 70:54)
didn't do 2500 you did any max (70:51 - 70:55)
um (70:54 - 70:57)
but but even if you don't like the go (70:55 - 70:59)
battling stuff if you'll never do the go (70:57 - 71:02)
battling stuff if you hate pvp i get it (70:59 - 71:04)
but (71:02 - 71:05)
adding (71:04 - 71:07)
rare candy to gifts (71:05 - 71:11)
is a great change for a lot of players (71:07 - 71:13)
a lot of players yeah i consider myself (71:11 - 71:16)
a hardcore pokemon go player i'm level (71:13 - 71:17)
46 (71:16 - 71:20)
i got 1500 rare candy i've i spend (71:17 - 71:23)
probably 15 to 20 a month on pogo i mean (71:20 - 71:25)
i'm not a whale whales are like probably (71:23 - 71:27)
like 15 to 20 a week (71:25 - 71:30)
i i've done 2 000 plus raids (71:27 - 71:33)
i play pogo every day (71:30 - 71:35)
i may know (71:33 - 71:36)
a leech because that's what i am i'm (71:35 - 71:39)
bleaching off of everybody (71:36 - 71:42)
but the the (71:39 - 71:43)
the (71:42 - 71:46)
voices you hear on twitter or the the (71:43 - 71:48)
the reddit threads those well sometimes (71:46 - 71:51)
those blate factory aka reddit (71:48 - 71:53)
those (71:51 - 71:57)
people don't represent the majority of (71:53 - 72:00)
players like even the whales are (71:57 - 72:03)
such a small small small portion (72:00 - 72:06)
of the player base (72:03 - 72:06)
i would i would imagine that almost (72:08 - 72:12)
all pokemon players won't even notice (72:12 - 72:15)
there's a difference (72:13 - 72:18)
i certainly won't i (72:15 - 72:18)
i (72:18 - 72:21)
until you told me this was happening i (72:18 - 72:23)
barely pay attention what i get from (72:21 - 72:24)
gifts as it is (72:23 - 72:26)
oh i i i don't even look at what my raid (72:24 - 72:28)
rewards are i just tap through it as (72:26 - 72:30)
possible clear through let's get let's (72:28 - 72:31)
get moving what am i what are like what (72:30 - 72:33)
am i going to do be like wow four rare (72:31 - 72:36)
candies only five this time for the like (72:33 - 72:38)
quick here i'll just move on yeah it's (72:36 - 72:41)
it's it's the weird loot box um hiding (72:38 - 72:44)
things behind pvp is a tried and true (72:41 - 72:46)
game (72:44 - 72:48)
yeah yeah yeah i mean they do it in it (72:46 - 72:50)
the final fantasy there's only certain (72:48 - 72:52)
amounts and armor you can get from pvp (72:50 - 72:53)
there are certain things is to encourage (72:52 - 72:55)
you to try that area if you really want (72:53 - 72:58)
to i will never do it i don't like pvp i (72:55 - 73:00)
don't enjoy it yeah for greg it's not (72:58 - 73:02)
like a pogo thing it's like (73:00 - 73:04)
an all game it's an all game thing but (73:02 - 73:06)
also (73:04 - 73:08)
y'all need to deal with your fomo (73:06 - 73:10)
hardcore (73:08 - 73:13)
like (73:10 - 73:13)
feeling like you're missing out because (73:13 - 73:17)
you're not getting too extra rare (73:15 - 73:19)
candies that you can now only get (73:17 - 73:23)
through great battle league (73:19 - 73:23)
sit down and think does this really (73:23 - 73:28)
change (73:26 - 73:32)
how i play the game (73:28 - 73:32)
again we don't know how many uh they're (73:33 - 73:38)
decreasing they say again the tweet says (73:35 - 73:40)
slightly (73:38 - 73:42)
really just sit down and think (73:40 - 73:45)
how like like if i don't get those pvp (73:42 - 73:47)
emblems (73:45 - 73:50)
what does that do what does that really (73:47 - 73:52)
do for me (73:50 - 73:56)
like there's a lot of (73:52 - 73:56)
a lot of games have killed my (73:56 - 74:01)
fomo for for like oh i want to get all (73:58 - 74:03)
the achievements because (74:01 - 74:06)
ultimately when that game shuts down all (74:03 - 74:08)
those achievements go away anyways like (74:06 - 74:10)
destiny won losing all of your whatever (74:08 - 74:12)
as it was that you spent (74:10 - 74:15)
yeah i know but like these are digital (74:12 - 74:17)
goods that you're renting anyways so (74:15 - 74:20)
like (74:17 - 74:20)
maybe like (74:21 - 74:26)
sit down and really think (74:23 - 74:29)
am i losing a lot before you like go on (74:26 - 74:31)
on a screed about (74:29 - 74:32)
the fact that they're slightly (74:31 - 74:34)
decreasing in one area and increasing it (74:32 - 74:36)
because it does sound like overall (74:34 - 74:38)
they're either keeping it at the same (74:36 - 74:41)
levels or you'll get slightly more (74:38 - 74:43)
because of gifts (74:41 - 74:45)
well even well (74:43 - 74:48)
also this part of the conversation like (74:45 - 74:50)
if you do a one-star raid (74:48 - 74:52)
you get significantly less for a candy (74:50 - 74:53)
versus a five-star rate (74:52 - 74:56)
so if you really care about rare candy (74:53 - 74:57)
are you just grinding out five star (74:56 - 74:59)
rates (74:57 - 75:01)
because are you (74:59 - 75:02)
you're probably not doing rock rough (75:01 - 75:04)
raids because you want rare candy you're (75:02 - 75:06)
probably spending the dollar on rock (75:04 - 75:08)
ruff because you want the one in 500 (75:06 - 75:11)
chance for shiny rock ruff (75:08 - 75:13)
like let's not pretend that this company (75:11 - 75:15)
is incredibly money grabby (75:13 - 75:16)
i mean they are (75:15 - 75:19)
heavy heavy money like like it's still (75:16 - 75:21)
it's still (75:19 - 75:23)
i'm a big pokemon go fan it is still (75:21 - 75:26)
incredibly frustrating and mind-blowing (75:23 - 75:28)
to think about (75:26 - 75:29)
hey do you want to spend a dollar on (75:28 - 75:32)
rockruff like that is such a weird (75:29 - 75:34)
sentence to come out of your mouth and (75:32 - 75:37)
think i agree do you want to spend a (75:34 - 75:39)
dollar on a (75:37 - 75:41)
well let's get rid of rockruff for a (75:39 - 75:43)
second do you want to spell it spend a (75:41 - 75:46)
dollar on bellsprout (75:43 - 75:47)
like (75:46 - 75:50)
alice brown (75:47 - 75:50)
i uh (75:51 - 75:55)
i see this change is good i think adding (75:53 - 75:57)
rare candy to gifts encouraging people (75:55 - 76:00)
to open gifts to send gifts to go out (75:57 - 76:02)
and spend stops to get gifts (76:00 - 76:04)
it fits with niantic's (76:02 - 76:06)
thing of hey go out and explore go out (76:04 - 76:07)
and spend some pokestops get some gifts (76:06 - 76:10)
send those gifts do it again (76:07 - 76:10)
here's where candy one of the best items (76:11 - 76:14)
in pogo now you can get for free without (76:12 - 76:16)
spending a dollar (76:14 - 76:18)
i i just see it as a good change (76:16 - 76:21)
yeah i i i see it as for me it's a (76:18 - 76:24)
neutral change like (76:21 - 76:24)
fine (76:24 - 76:27)
like i'm sitting on so many rare candies (76:24 - 76:28)
and i don't know what to spend them on (76:27 - 76:30)
anyways because really rare candies and (76:28 - 76:32)
leveling my pokemon (76:30 - 76:34)
are things i only do when it tells me (76:32 - 76:36)
that i have to oh well don't get me (76:34 - 76:37)
started on like the (76:36 - 76:39)
don't spend any of your candies until (76:37 - 76:41)
you do enough raids until you get a (76:39 - 76:44)
perfect 15 15. like how dare you spend (76:41 - 76:45)
your work i don't know (76:44 - 76:47)
yeah don't spend your rare (76:45 - 76:49)
candy don't spend your rare candies on (76:47 - 76:51)
mailman (76:49 - 76:53)
you can open it once a week and just you (76:51 - 76:56)
know you can open it every three days (76:53 - 76:58)
every three days you can try to set a (76:56 - 77:00)
reminder to go into mail metal or you (76:58 - 77:03)
could just one thing (77:00 - 77:05)
because you have unlimited access to mel (77:03 - 77:07)
metal forever you don't have unlimited (77:05 - 77:09)
access to mewtwo (77:07 - 77:12)
i've got eight mewtwo's (77:09 - 77:14)
well use our candy on youtube power one (77:12 - 77:14)
up (77:14 - 77:17)
better have shadow (77:14 - 77:17)
so you should hey will (77:22 - 77:26)
i give you permission to spend those (77:24 - 77:31)
candies oh do not use kids (77:26 - 77:31)
i give you free permission to play the (77:32 - 77:38)
game how you want to play how dare you (77:35 - 77:40)

niantic which i literally only used to (79:58 - 80:04)
buy pokemon storage i mean i during (80:01 - 80:07)
during the during the pandemi (80:04 - 80:09)
it was really easy to just leave (80:07 - 80:10)
to drive around the neighborhood and (80:09 - 80:13)
leave things in gyms and then get 50 (80:10 - 80:16)

you you have just proved proved (81:27 - 81:32)
to the listening audience that you just (81:30 - 81:34)
fill it up with garbage you don't need (81:32 - 81:38)
i need everywhere i can i have something (81:34 - 81:40)
for what for what you don't allow (81:38 - 81:43)
anybody to use it yes known order i have (81:40 - 81:46)
1518 (81:43 - 81:50)
items taking up my space and i have 321 (81:46 - 81:52)
rare candies which i think is my top (81:50 - 81:54)
thing (81:52 - 81:54)
um that's a good question you don't need (81:56 - 82:00)
it you don't need it you don't need the (81:58 - 82:02)
space why am i giving them money i'm (82:00 - 82:04)
giving the money so i can hoard (82:02 - 82:08)
garbage in my virtual space or i can (82:04 - 82:10)
just check it like do you know how many (82:08 - 82:12)
berries i threw out every day to make (82:10 - 82:14)
space because i'm just they're just (82:12 - 82:16)
gonna give me more berries the night i (82:14 - 82:18)
never use them the nice thing about (82:16 - 82:20)
space in pokemon go that makes it (82:18 - 82:22)
somewhat unique is that it is permanent (82:20 - 82:25)
it is not a consumable and every once in (82:22 - 82:27)
a while when i'm feeling really really (82:25 - 82:28)
tired and i just don't want to deal with (82:27 - 82:31)
it i will buy more storage space for it (82:28 - 82:33)
it's the only time it goes up and i will (82:31 - 82:39)
use the coins i got from sitting on gyms (82:33 - 82:39)
uh one more question from youtube here (82:39 - 82:43)
this is from uh frank uh (82:40 - 82:44)
where do you see the show in five years (82:43 - 82:46)
do you want to grow it maintain what (82:44 - 82:47)
you've created move on to other things (82:46 - 82:49)
love the show keep up the great work are (82:47 - 82:52)
those is it multiple choice (82:49 - 82:54)
yeah you can pick one (82:52 - 82:57)
move on to other things all right (82:54 - 82:59)
what are you gonna move on to (82:57 - 83:01)
uh have i talked to you have i (82:59 - 83:04)
proselytized about my love for bike (83:01 - 83:05)
packing (83:04 - 83:07)
oh yeah yeah okay here we go all right (83:05 - 83:08)
yeah it's going to be here (83:07 - 83:10)
you watch a youtube about bike packing (83:08 - 83:13)
at your own house you're going to be out (83:10 - 83:14)
bike packing look i (83:13 - 83:18)
don't look as i get older the desire to (83:14 - 83:20)
change things in my life decreases (83:18 - 83:22)
drastically (83:20 - 83:25)
i like my routine (83:22 - 83:25)
uh (83:25 - 83:29)
so i look i i can't answer this for my (83:25 - 83:31)
career that matters (83:29 - 83:34)
much less a podcast that i do for fun (83:31 - 83:35)
yeah (83:34 - 83:37)
i mean do i what do i want the show to (83:35 - 83:40)
still exist in five years yeah (83:37 - 83:42)
do i want pokemon to exist in five years (83:40 - 83:45)
yeah do i want to be a part of it in (83:42 - 83:46)
five years in some port (83:45 - 83:49)
absolutely (83:46 - 83:49)
uh for me like obviously i want the the (83:50 - 83:53)
show to grow (83:52 - 83:54)
um (83:53 - 83:56)
i think there was like one point in my (83:54 - 83:59)
life for this so yeah it's your job (83:56 - 84:01)
i think at one point in my life i i did (83:59 - 84:03)
have i did think to myself like oh i (84:01 - 84:05)
don't want to be known as like the (84:03 - 84:07)
pokemon guy forever (84:05 - 84:10)
well get wrecked (84:07 - 84:11)
and (84:10 - 84:12)
start working on a different personality (84:11 - 84:14)
trait because this is the only one you (84:12 - 84:16)
got so far oh my gosh (84:14 - 84:19)
that doesn't like bother me anymore um (84:16 - 84:22)
and i think maybe it's just by being in (84:19 - 84:25)
the content creation space for so long (84:22 - 84:29)
and liking pokemon so much that i (84:25 - 84:32)
i got over that that (84:29 - 84:35)
identity crisis i guess um (84:32 - 84:37)
like like i was i was saying on twitch (84:35 - 84:39)
i've been playing eldon ring on twitch (84:37 - 84:42)
uh which i i really really enjoy it's (84:39 - 84:45)
really great um and i know my viewership (84:42 - 84:48)
on twitch is is significantly lower (84:45 - 84:50)
because it's not a pokemon game (84:48 - 84:52)
and i think somebody said like oh are (84:50 - 84:55)
you just burnt out or sick of pokemon (84:52 - 84:56)
and the genuine answer that question is (84:55 - 84:59)
like no like i have so much to do in (84:56 - 85:01)
pokemon like i want to i want to get to (84:59 - 85:04)
master rank and unite because i (85:01 - 85:07)
i like it at a high level i want to (85:04 - 85:08)
build a new competitive team and sword (85:07 - 85:10)
and shield i want to practice for the ic (85:08 - 85:12)
i want to play the tea i want to (85:10 - 85:14)
i still have like four shiny hunts in (85:12 - 85:16)
sword and shield i want to shiny hunt (85:14 - 85:19)
shaymin and bdsp i still play pokemon go (85:16 - 85:21)
every day i still play pokemon masters (85:19 - 85:23)
every week not every day to be fair (85:21 - 85:25)
every week (85:23 - 85:27)
i uh (85:25 - 85:30)
i i'm almost done with my black 2 white (85:27 - 85:32)
2 pokedex i almost have the shiny charm (85:30 - 85:34)
in black 2 white 2 i'm missing like 80 (85:32 - 85:36)
pokemon out of like the 500 or whatever (85:34 - 85:38)
pokemon are in that game i (85:36 - 85:39)
have a bunch of things i need to do in x (85:38 - 85:41)
and y before pokemon bank eventually (85:39 - 85:43)
closes one day i have a bunch of things (85:41 - 85:45)
to do in omega ruby alpha sapphire like (85:43 - 85:47)
i have so many things i literally have a (85:45 - 85:50)
to-do list of things to do in pokemon (85:47 - 85:50)
games (85:50 - 85:53)
and not bored like i have so many things (85:50 - 85:55)
i want to do and i'm excited to do and (85:53 - 85:58)
that i'm like i really want to do and (85:55 - 86:00)
right now i right now i just want to (85:58 - 86:02)
spend a week or two playing elden ring (86:00 - 86:03)
but that doesn't mean i'm burnt out of (86:02 - 86:05)
pokemon i'm just like this is a cool new (86:03 - 86:08)
game the question in the thought process (86:05 - 86:10)
of when you switch to something else are (86:08 - 86:11)
you burned out (86:10 - 86:13)
taking breaks from things is how you (86:11 - 86:16)
don't get burnt out correct (86:13 - 86:18)
taking a break (86:16 - 86:21)
instead of having it be your 24 7 (86:18 - 86:24)
is how you don't burn yourself out like (86:21 - 86:26)
that is a sign of a healthy (86:24 - 86:29)
relationship it's why you have to take (86:26 - 86:31)
vacation days at work (86:29 - 86:33)
you know what's funny is as i feel like (86:31 - 86:35)
pokemon fans specifically on twitch they (86:33 - 86:38)
actually don't play any other games and (86:35 - 86:40)
it's like it's kind of weird to be like (86:38 - 86:41)
like it's kind of the experience share (86:40 - 86:43)
thing i think of where people are like (86:41 - 86:45)
ah i hate that pokemon has like (86:43 - 86:47)
experience chair always on and it's like (86:45 - 86:49)
have you never played anything yeah (86:47 - 86:53)
jrpg this is like a very very common (86:49 - 86:54)
thing (86:53 - 86:57)
well i mean i think (86:54 - 86:57)
they do do other things right like but (86:57 - 87:02)
they just don't contextualize it in the (87:00 - 87:04)
same way (87:02 - 87:06)
i'm sure they play other games i'm sure (87:04 - 87:08)
they do other aspects of their life (87:06 - 87:12)
their life is not 24 7. i wake up (87:08 - 87:15)
i switch on pokemon i play it for an (87:12 - 87:17)
eight-hour job and then come like well (87:15 - 87:19)
those are pokemon go players those are (87:17 - 87:20)
probably gonna go players and even they (87:19 - 87:22)
do other things um (87:20 - 87:26)
i i do think like (87:22 - 87:26)
people can be mystified when you do (87:27 - 87:34)
something else for your job it's like (87:30 - 87:36)
i don't work on the same courses when (87:34 - 87:39)
i'm making courses for work i do switch (87:36 - 87:41)
around and i do work for different (87:39 - 87:44)
departments because (87:41 - 87:44)
my the the department and the teams that (87:44 - 87:48)
i work for i have the most i've been (87:46 - 87:51)
working there for 25 years i know their (87:48 - 87:54)
stuff inside and out and quite frankly (87:51 - 87:57)
i'm tired of dealing with them sometimes (87:54 - 87:59)
and to continue working with them i need (87:57 - 88:01)
to go elsewhere to be like i just need (87:59 - 88:02)
to see (88:01 - 88:04)
what else is happening because i also (88:02 - 88:06)
need to be aware of (88:04 - 88:09)
what else is happening in other aspects (88:06 - 88:11)
it's the same with games if you only (88:09 - 88:13)
play pokemon and that's your only (88:11 - 88:15)
reference for jrpgs you are missing out (88:13 - 88:19)
where the rest of the community is going (88:15 - 88:20)
because (88:19 - 88:22)
pokemon is (88:20 - 88:24)
very conservative in the most in the (88:22 - 88:26)
things that they change but you can (88:24 - 88:28)
learn a lot from more (88:26 - 88:30)
for lesser-known titles or titles that (88:28 - 88:32)
change more often you can look at like (88:30 - 88:34)
final fantasy which no two games are (88:32 - 88:36)
ever the same really (88:34 - 88:39)
um but they follow certain formulas like (88:36 - 88:40)
there is a (88:39 - 88:43)
huge health benefit and an insight (88:40 - 88:44)
benefit (88:43 - 88:47)
by switching to other things it's a (88:44 - 88:49)
we used to call it media literacy back (88:47 - 88:51)
in the day they still still think they (88:49 - 88:54)
do but it's why you watch other genres (88:51 - 88:56)
of tv it's why you (88:54 - 88:59)
look at other pieces of art it's why you (88:56 - 89:01)
look at other things as you can develop (88:59 - 89:03)
a stronger literacy (89:01 - 89:06)
and so when you come back to those (89:03 - 89:08)
things that you love you can both (89:06 - 89:11)
appreciate them more and understand why (89:08 - 89:14)
the flaws exist and better conceptualize (89:11 - 89:16)
your arguments for the changes that you (89:14 - 89:19)
want or the things you like to see or (89:16 - 89:21)
have a better understanding of why (89:19 - 89:23)
things work and so (89:21 - 89:25)
taking breaks (89:23 - 89:28)
turning off a game switching to elden (89:25 - 89:29)
ring which is like the hot new thing hey (89:28 - 89:32)
let's see what everybody's excited about (89:29 - 89:33)
because those are things that you can (89:32 - 89:36)
say i like this and i want this in the (89:33 - 89:37)
thing that i love (89:36 - 89:39)
all of those things are great ways to (89:37 - 89:42)
improve how you love the things that you (89:39 - 89:43)
love (89:42 - 89:45)
stop you from getting burnt out and stop (89:43 - 89:48)
you from living in sort of a myopic one (89:45 - 89:50)
view of (89:48 - 89:53)
it can only be this way and it should (89:50 - 89:56)
only ever be this way and i think a lot (89:53 - 89:58)
of people who really hyper focus on (89:56 - 90:02)
fandoms and how fandoms turn toxic is (89:58 - 90:04)
because they don't branch out to see (90:02 - 90:06)
what's happening elsewhere and so they (90:04 - 90:08)
get very (90:06 - 90:10)
closely identified with that one thing (90:08 - 90:12)
and then change (90:10 - 90:14)
bothers them because they feel like (90:12 - 90:16)
they're changing (90:14 - 90:18)
their (90:16 - 90:19)
they're having to change when the world (90:18 - 90:21)
if they had been paying attention had (90:19 - 90:23)
already changed around them they just (90:21 - 90:26)
weren't paying attention (90:23 - 90:28)
yeah i think one of my favorite things (90:26 - 90:31)
also about like i like i i'm very (90:28 - 90:33)
confident that the podcast will exist in (90:31 - 90:35)
five years and i hope the podcast is (90:33 - 90:36)
bigger in five years and i hope it (90:35 - 90:40)
reaches more people um but the thing (90:36 - 90:41)
that oz always stuck with me is when (90:40 - 90:43)
people reach out to me whether that's (90:41 - 90:46)
like twitter or discord or slack or or (90:43 - 90:48)
wherever and they're like (90:46 - 90:50)
i found your show and your show made me (90:48 - 90:52)
love pokemon again (90:50 - 90:56)
and like i was or and or i was a casual (90:52 - 90:58)
pokemon fan but now i started playing (90:56 - 91:00)
pokemon go or now i i did download (90:58 - 91:02)
pokemon masters or i did take your (91:00 - 91:04)
advice and i did try bravely default (91:02 - 91:05)
because i heard you compare bravely (91:04 - 91:07)
default to pokemon legends or whatever (91:05 - 91:09)
and i really like that game i have i had (91:07 - 91:12)
tons of people in the last week though (91:09 - 91:14)
i've never played a dark souls game and (91:12 - 91:16)
i i had no interest in eldon ring and i (91:14 - 91:18)
watched you play elden ring and i saw (91:16 - 91:20)
how much fun you were having with it (91:18 - 91:22)
and i went out and picked it up (91:20 - 91:23)
and (91:22 - 91:27)
that's like great like i think yeah that (91:23 - 91:29)
if if like pokemon is my number one (91:27 - 91:30)
always will be my number one but i love (91:29 - 91:33)
branching out and playing other stuff (91:30 - 91:34)
because it makes me think about pokemon (91:33 - 91:36)
in a different way (91:34 - 91:38)
like all through eldon ring i was like (91:36 - 91:40)
the auto save is on (91:38 - 91:42)
i can't i can't like save scum like i (91:40 - 91:45)
can in pokemon like i can't like (91:42 - 91:47)
i mean maybe maybe there's a setting to (91:45 - 91:49)
turn it off and like el and in elden (91:47 - 91:51)
ring there's um (91:49 - 91:53)
you died you mentioned that game for an (91:51 - 91:55)
auto save not to be permanently on (91:53 - 91:57)
that's all i'm gonna say yeah (91:55 - 92:01)
you are already losing so much progress (91:57 - 92:04)
uh and then like also in in elder ring (92:01 - 92:07)
it's like i am fighting things that i am (92:04 - 92:11)
under leveled severely under leveled for (92:07 - 92:13)
and i think about that in the sense of (92:11 - 92:15)
pokemon like (92:13 - 92:17)
what if i went into this gym severely (92:15 - 92:20)
under leveled would i have as fun of (92:17 - 92:22)
time being under leveled in pokemon that (92:20 - 92:24)
i have in elden ring and i don't know (92:22 - 92:26)
what that loop is yet i don't i mean i (92:24 - 92:27)
think about it i don't know is it is it (92:26 - 92:30)
because i get to the battle so fast is (92:27 - 92:31)
it because like there's different (92:30 - 92:34)
opportunities just like still win (92:31 - 92:35)
is it because (92:34 - 92:37)
they got lucky is it because i got lucky (92:35 - 92:39)
how does that apply back to pokemon if i (92:37 - 92:41)
was under leveled (92:39 - 92:43)
um (92:41 - 92:44)
if i'm overlapping (92:43 - 92:46)
is there a big punishment in eldering (92:44 - 92:48)
when you die do you lose a lot of stuff (92:46 - 92:50)
you so every time you kill something in (92:48 - 92:54)
elgin ring you get um like (92:50 - 92:56)
and that currency and that you use that (92:54 - 92:57)
currency to buy everything it's the (92:56 - 92:58)
economy in the game so you can use it to (92:57 - 93:01)
buy new items if you if you die if the (92:58 - 93:03)
boss defeats you what do you lose when (93:01 - 93:05)
you die you lose all the currency you (93:03 - 93:07)
are currently holding (93:05 - 93:10)
so if you're going through a dungeon (93:07 - 93:12)
and you there's not a good way back and (93:10 - 93:14)
there's not a good way forward and you (93:12 - 93:17)
die all your currency drops there and (93:14 - 93:19)
you have to go back and pick it up if (93:17 - 93:21)
you die on your way to go back and pick (93:19 - 93:24)
it up it is permanently gone (93:21 - 93:26)
now you could backtrack to drop off your (93:24 - 93:29)
currency and spend it but every time you (93:26 - 93:31)
drop it off (93:29 - 93:33)
all the enemies reset (93:31 - 93:35)
so if you're like 90 through the dungeon (93:33 - 93:37)
and you're like i'm about to fight the (93:35 - 93:38)
boss but i don't want to lose all this (93:37 - 93:40)
currency i'm holding and you go back to (93:38 - 93:42)
spend it so you because you can go in (93:40 - 93:43)
the boss with no currency and you're (93:42 - 93:45)
like there's no punishment i got nothing (93:43 - 93:46)
to lose except (93:45 - 93:48)
you know time time but if you go back to (93:46 - 93:50)
drop it off before the boss you now have (93:48 - 93:52)
to defeat all the enemies you defeated (93:50 - 93:53)
to get back to the boss so there's a (93:52 - 93:55)
there's a certain point in the game (93:53 - 93:56)
you run around them (93:55 - 93:58)
and just ignore them (93:56 - 93:59)
i've seen you (93:58 - 94:01)
jump off (93:59 - 94:04)
you could have like 20 000 souls and (94:01 - 94:06)
you're like i can i can level twice with (94:04 - 94:08)
20 000 souls and then you accidentally (94:06 - 94:10)
die and you go oh no big deal it's right (94:08 - 94:12)
up the elevator and then you run (94:10 - 94:13)
straight to the elevator and then you (94:12 - 94:14)
realize the elevator has not been (94:13 - 94:16)
lowered and then you fall down the hole (94:14 - 94:17)
of the elevator because you're not (94:16 - 94:19)
paying attention and then you're like (94:17 - 94:20)
well (94:19 - 94:21)
i guess i really didn't need those 20 (94:20 - 94:23)
000 souls (94:21 - 94:26)
i i watched you (94:23 - 94:29)
get crushed by a spike ceiling (94:26 - 94:33)
multiple times and i was (94:29 - 94:35)
so frustrated watching you deal with (94:33 - 94:38)
that that i literally left i'm like i (94:35 - 94:40)
can't with this right now did you watch (94:38 - 94:41)
me spend two hours on a dragon last (94:40 - 94:44)
night and then get the dragon to one hp (94:41 - 94:45)
and i (94:44 - 94:47)
die i saw (94:45 - 94:50)
you ride a horse in front of fire twice (94:47 - 94:52)
and i'm like nope we're out because i (94:50 - 94:54)
know what this is my dog this loop is (94:52 - 94:56)
going to go and i'm done (94:54 - 94:58)
there's something very (94:56 - 94:59)
it's it's a twitch thing but there's (94:58 - 95:02)
something very um (94:59 - 95:06)
nice i guess about like being very close (95:02 - 95:07)
to beating a boss and like seeing your (95:06 - 95:09)
twitch chat like freak out of like oh (95:07 - 95:11)
it's gonna happen and then like you die (95:09 - 95:14)
and they're like (95:11 - 95:16)
dragon (95:14 - 95:17)
i mean everything's different when you (95:16 - 95:19)
have an audience (95:17 - 95:21)
yeah that's very true um (95:19 - 95:23)
sitting at home watching you (95:21 - 95:25)
watching myself die i'd be like we're (95:23 - 95:27)
out of this game all right (95:25 - 95:30)
last week's pokemon uh the (95:27 - 95:34)
gender ratio for the baby pokemon is (95:30 - 95:36)
different from the gender ratio for i (95:34 - 95:37)
guess what you would call the middle (95:36 - 95:40)
evolution even though it came before (95:37 - 95:44)
the baby in the final evolution um so (95:40 - 95:46)
that there was a certain percentage of (95:44 - 95:50)
the babies whose gender would switch (95:46 - 95:52)
as it evolved (95:50 - 95:55)
but that um mechanic (95:52 - 95:57)
was taken out of the games uh beginning (95:55 - 96:00)
with pokemon x and y and any future (95:57 - 96:01)
games (96:00 - 96:03)
where you could get this baby pokemon (96:01 - 96:05)
and evolve it who's that i should i (96:03 - 96:08)
actually know this it's (96:05 - 96:11)
man tyke (96:08 - 96:11)
it's a zero azure (96:12 - 96:17)
wait what it is oh yeah you're right it (96:15 - 96:20)
is a zoo i was still wrong (96:17 - 96:21)
wait you actually thought it was man (96:20 - 96:23)
tyke yeah because i know there's a bait (96:21 - 96:25)
i i did think it was man tyke no you're (96:23 - 96:27)
right it is a zero (96:25 - 96:28)
you know i know i know it's i was (96:27 - 96:30)
surprised how confident you were about (96:28 - 96:31)
man (96:30 - 96:33)
look i didn't think much of it last week (96:31 - 96:35)
i just when will said it last week i was (96:33 - 96:36)
like oh man like and then i never (96:35 - 96:40)
thought about it again (96:36 - 96:40)
oh (96:40 - 96:43)
boy (96:42 - 96:47)
uh the polka dot pokemon (96:43 - 96:48)
does (96:47 - 96:50)
earl have polka dots on it hey that's (96:48 - 96:53)
what it's called i mean it's got a dot (96:50 - 96:56)
doesn't it that sits on his cheeks (96:53 - 96:58)
okay (96:56 - 96:58)
polka dots are known in japan as (96:58 - 97:03)
misutama (97:01 - 97:05)
literally meaning water balls this may (97:03 - 97:07)
explain why azural is known as the polka (97:05 - 97:09)
dot pokemon no (97:07 - 97:12)
because it's a little water bowl (97:09 - 97:14)
prior to generation six because azuro's (97:12 - 97:16)
gender ratio does not match (97:14 - 97:18)
that of its evolved form and its (97:16 - 97:19)
evolutions (97:18 - 97:22)
is not dependent on gender being 75 (97:19 - 97:23)
percent of (97:22 - 97:25)
um (97:23 - 97:29)
being 75 wait what is this 17 female 75 (97:25 - 97:31)
of zeros is the only pokemon to do this (97:29 - 97:33)
from generation six and onwards azuro (97:31 - 97:35)
retains its gender upon evolving despite (97:33 - 97:37)
the gender ratios being different that (97:35 - 97:39)
is the trivia that the whole thing was (97:37 - 97:40)
based off of (97:39 - 97:42)
so garbage they should have kept it that (97:40 - 97:45)
was the best part (97:42 - 97:46)
oh i didn't know it was normal fairy (97:45 - 97:49)
yeah was that water at all wait what no (97:46 - 97:52)
it's not water until it evolves i didn't (97:49 - 97:54)
know that actually i had no clue (97:52 - 97:56)
like if if if there was a daily squirtle (97:54 - 97:59)
you would have lost i would have lost (97:56 - 98:01)
oh man when those things come up with my (97:59 - 98:04)
tick tock i'm like not interested (98:01 - 98:04)
uh (98:05 - 98:08)
