[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 469th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello welcome to such a nice number 469 it's it's very nice to be here and will is here i the opposite of everything greg just said why are you so confrontational because positive energy towards 469 dude i only got like 11 hours of sleep and that's a lot of sleep not enough not enough how many how many hours of sleep do you need 20 20. that's most of them i'm just like a cat i'm awake for four hours i'm alert for four hours and the other 20 i need to be in full rest that sounds like a good life it is it's a good life if you can get it uh this is the week before go fest so with that being said there's a lot of gofest news and so we're going to cover that and i'm out of town next week and my thought process was let's just record two episodes today but i know the second we do that there's going to be a bunch of news this week so we'll play next week's episode i mean there will be an episode next week split this episode into two i thought about that too we'll go five hours and you get two no no no no no no we go the standard 90 minutes and they get two 45-minute episodes i've got sleep if we went for five hours i definitely wouldn't get enough sleep the question is are they way too early for question of the week yeah but like we knowing unite is coming this month yep we don't we don't have a date yet nope it better not be next weekend because it is cinno month based on their plushies slash tcg card slash twitter slash badoof you would think that this would be the month they announced more details for the remakes but you know they've done weirder things like like nothing at all nothing they've done weirder things like ignoring that this is the 25th anniversary hey we have an audio collaboration coming eventually have you reached out the oreos are in my mouth that does not exist that's also not gonna happen in this house uh have you reached out to your contacts at the pokemon company international just to make sure like they're still alive that there wasn't some sort of catastrophic black mesa event have you called your uncle recently uh you know my uncle at nintendo not answering their phone that could be bad could be exactly you know what you know what like and it's like that heat wave in the pacific northwest and everything this all sounds like a pokemon game yeah right some groudon escaped and like has destroyed trained pokemon headquarters pacific northwest we need you the pokemon trainer to come save them yeah speaking of heating up [Music] the first bit of news was gigantomax charizard copper raja and more in max raid battles that's happening this that happened this weekend you missed it if you're listening on monday it's gone that's true uh so they they for anyone who don't doesn't know why these pokemon were picked or maybe they just didn't know there was an event this weekend uh there's a reason why we're bringing this up number one is because they're doing an event because they did an event this past weekend you would think that they're not going to announce you an event over go festive weekend but they've done two events in a row before you would be wrong but uh the reason that it's coughing lava fat military copper raja and charizard is because that's the cooking metals that you get coughing being the worst charizard being the best um but they promoted a shiny copper raja this event uh and it was the first time ever that you could get the opposite food 10 in your game which was a version exclusive and you would have to like attach the food tin to a pokemon and then trade the pokemon over that's how you would get it and you need all 151 different tins or not tins but meals uh in order to get the golden ladle and the golden fan so when you're cooking you can really show off to you look none other than the other people you're cooking with yeah nobody can find my camp much like the uh sit there and scream at steve i'm next to the tree and will steve ever find me no it's the same people buying the pokemon grill set valid yeah you always got to just set up camp in the best places like directly in front of the daycare or do you know how many people are in front of the daycare in that campsite there's like 50. i know that's that's the go-to place i think it's cool that i i would i would bet maybe that there was some sort of a game plan with these rollouts of raids like i don't think that like somebody i can't imagine there's somebody at game freak being like what do you want to do for a raid event this month and being like you know no one has that bach foot in yet let's put what like i feel like this is eventually part of like the things we can do i mean i think you're giving them a lot of credit but sure there has to be like one person i'm sure there is one person saying there's one person that's trying to manage the google calendar where they come up and say okay susan what's this what's what's happening this week and she's like i don't i don't i don't just do a food thing i don't know you pay me a dollar 75 an hour i'm an intern that's that's really what it is right there wait oh real question does japan have interns or is that an america thing everywhere has your turn every corporation that can get you to work for free and college experience has it it's a bad practice and it should end hey have you been around since the middle ages or medieval times it's called an apprenticeship your family sold you to the blacksmith as his apprentice apprentice and then you maybe started your own business if you didn't die of fever shiny chances aside yes i would say that sword and shield has been one of the easily the best pokemon game when it comes to a person who has no friends oh yeah yeah because in order to get all the pokemon in order to complete your curry decks in order to get whatever xyz not those games you always needed to trade and this has been a thing since red and blue and because of these raid events of mixing and matching because of the rotation of raids they have pretty much made it where like the only thing i think that you would actually need to trade for would be a legend at this point yeah but like yeah the thing ponyta farfetch all of these version exclusives have i think all been in raids up to this point yes i think so yeah it's been very loner friendly it's a very loner-friendly game it takes the the isolationist uh heart of the united kingdom and has embraced it fully was a reference to last week yes also did you get your shiny elephant no i i i was playing go all weekend so i'll have some time today hopefully i did i got it i found one damn i caught it in a repeat ball and i'm like and i'm done you know i think copperaja looks good in a safari ball uh if i found my own den i would have done that but since i was in somebody else's repeat ball away this is also off pokemon.com the 25th anniversary invitational we're all invited i'm sure um features celebrated tcg and video game players continuing the celebration of 25 years an exciting event is on its way spotlighting some of the best competitive players the pokemon players cup 25 anniversary invitational will feature eight top tcg players and eight top video game players from around the world in exciting head-to-head matches they will face off in double elimination bracket as they seek to prove who's the true champion you admit this is the thing where they said that i still think at the end of the day this is a little weird because all they're doing is they're taking the top eight from players cup four which they didn't say until after players cup four was on its way so like if you were like i'll just wait for players cup five or you know i'm not into player skip four and then they're like we're doing this invitational and you're like what why didn't you tell us that now you've learned you've always gotta be in yeah always no slacking allowed but what did you wanna take there's been four player cups wouldn't you want to take the like top four players from each of them i mean right yeah strangely it doesn't matter what i would want to do it's the person who made the decision who actually matters yep i mean i'm excited that my alt channel uh wolf glick it's i will be participating under my alias uh so look forward to seeing me wreck house uh steve claims that he beat me once and that is vastly incorrect i thought wolf skip players got before you think that but i'm here dude no i i thought i thought they actually did because they won players cup two three they won one of them with colossal spoiler the first three players cups were all one with colossal i don't know if we got the finals to four yet i haven't been following that closely uh some other news off pokemon.com pokemon master journeys the series ash and go travels through the world of pokemon uh to

a cool dude go with cinderacci um yeah it's it's a it's a wild uh wild screenshot right there they have taken artistic liberties i wanna i wanna get sidetracked real quick oh no uh because i forgot i was like there was something i wanted to talk about this week uh okay so um we've had the jaywits on the show before i think yes most people know the jaywits they're a very popular youtuber got like 2 million subs whatever we've had him on the show like five years ago his name is josh um and he did a tweet although keep in mind this is like an unofficial tweet but i think it's i think it's a good talking point uh he said if you played the new pokemon snap i'm curious how far did you get in and i would say so 5151 people participated that's uh 5 000 people a lot i think in a survey sure what's scientific research what do you need like 1 000 people are saying that depends it depends there's a lot of variables yeah well this is scientific twitter research this i mean okay this is not scientific this is twitter research can we leave the scientific off of this thank you uh so 6.8 percent we'll just say seven percent said they basically one hundred percent um what how what do you define 100 percent like every every photo i don't know all all stars all photos all all stars all photos but not all four star not all four star stars just all photos no 100 is all stars all photos yeah oh yeah yeah but not like four star on all but you can get a four star diamond rank diamond rank all photos diamond rank everything yes not diamond rank no yeah you have to get a one star two star three star and a four star for every pokemon yes yes that's what i would say 100 is well then you're weak and that's not 100 uh beat story plus extra stuff so that's 16.2 um beat the main story uh 19 and then didn't finish it 58 cheers good job we're that's where will is so i would say finish it would be i'm still on meganium i would say finish it would just be getting credits right because that's the next option like beat the main story would be getting credits oh yeah that's the main story so if you're looking at that that means you did not get you did not get the credits you did not complete the story one out of five people got credits when they bought the game according to twitter according like i said i think 5 000 people is a pretty pretty good sample size um it is i think i mean it is yeah twitter who also fought like it is a very specific audience so you cannot say that it is representative of the larger pokemon snap community because you are only getting 20 of those people who actually use twitter and then a subset of them who actually follow jaywits and then a subset of them who actually bothered to take the survey true it is not representative it is indicative of what possible trends don't use big words we can't say that it is representative of the larger community we can attempt to draw conclusions from the data provided understanding that the data is not a pure controlled representative sample of people who bought pokemon snap but you're never going to get that with any survey well you are from a company was this approved by the irb even even okay so what i don't ever get about these like polls is they'll be like we went out and we we found out that like seven out of eight people like their iphone and it's like who did you i hate my iphone i mean so we can turn this into statistics this is where margin of error comes in so like you you'll always have to look at what the margin of error is which is what they were trying to control for saying uh we took random samples so they took phone book or however they picked their samples or they went out on the street into a specific location so that you aren't focusing your audience you're trying to keep it as random as possible but then you still have to build in a margin of error saying we could not control for these factors so the data may be skewed because it's more likely that iphone users will answer an iphone poll and iphone users are more likely to say yes depending on how you pull those people yeah no i understand that i feel like the best range of did like did you finish it or whatever is like the playstation trophies because those are actual people who bought the game yes because that's how they got the truth but there's no other filter right it's reportable based on solely what is reported to playstation right like nintendo knows for sure because it's connected to the internet and they can see i don't know because monster hunter stories too had a legit thing that you had to agree to that says is it okay if we monitor your gameplay experience and take reports let us know if that's not okay and it had a little checkbox that you had to sign off and say yes i agree for capcom to get my information i never seen that for anything in pokemon and if one company is doing it all companies need to be doing it need to be aren't but need to be i can tell you that much [Laughter] yeah i mean every time you connect to the internet in pogo or in pokemon certain shield they they have to know like okay this player has caught you know 70 000 pokemon yeah and on average a player catches five pokemon this guy's the exception i mean the thing is is most of most companies are not tying your you to your data usually they will only say hey can we collect it is they're going to tie it to your data so nintendo can collect averages from user data where your specific name and id have been stripped from it to get signed posts of how their game is doing all right draw your conclusions off this clearly uh biased poll i don't think it's bias it's not like it's not like the it's not like j wits is like a pokemon dude i would say he's like a nintendo dude i wouldn't say he's a pokemon dude i would think if anyone put up a poll that i think his is more his is less bias i guess maybe there should have been an option of like i didn't play it yeah uh but i think 20 of people beating the game i think that's higher than i would expect again going back to those playstation polls you'll see like destiny or something and they'll be like oh fifty percent of you didn't even get the first like boss done like what why did you even spend sixty dollars on those games i mean overwatch i think it's i think it's pretty easy to get through the game like you could get to credits in 12 hours if you didn't yeah you do a bunch of stuff so there's a lot to hold somebody's attention though i mean like if if if you're really pretty like oh the game is fun but it's not amazing like man 12 you're asking a lot for 12 hours okay i think so right it's like it's like a weekend yeah but that's dedicated right if you're just gonna sit there for 12 who has 12 hours to sit there straight that's like four aw wait three awake periods for me think of it this way though like i want to get back into final fantasy and they have the free 14-day login right now which is like perfect timing i also have a code but like like i this is how i feel like people feel when they they play games like it almost feels like a chore where you're like i gotta log in i gotta figure out where i was what am i doing next where instead and this is what i always tell people or at least how i think like when when i was a kid or even when i was late early 20s like i felt like we didn't have that many options for video games so when somebody was like oh this video game's like 40 hours long you're like heck yeah because either one one i can't afford a new game so i'm gonna get the most value out of this game or two games aren't coming out fast enough whereas in this day and age with so many free to play games so many discounted games on steam um so okay i feel like if your game doesn't ha if your game isn't solid 12 hours is asking a lot where you just go i can go back to pokemon snap or i can go back to apex because it's easy to jump in or i disagree with the fact that there were fewer games back then because you were talking for you what 2000's okay when i was like 20 the only like game on iphone was like doodle jump and cut the rope the episode didn't exist until 2007. but there were a lot of other there were a lot of games there were i mean there were they we need a survey how many games are there now compared to that i mean there were three there were the three game systems were all running full for plus pc yeah that i think landscape hasn't changed that has is there are a lot more free to play games yes smartphones have radically altered the game landscape so you have a fifth contender now but i don't think that that made the decisions to put time into a game any less 20 years ago you just the barrier of entry was you had to pay for a game and decided it was worth it given that there were still free-to-play games on pcs such as the ones that are people who played minecraft for thousands of hours there are people who played solitaire that came on their computer for thousands of hours pc pinball game that game was rad too mine sweeper wasn't that one that everybody played uh there was snake on your old phones i mean there were things always to distract you i i think it's got more competitive now because there are way many more cheaper options and we have a lot of living games now compared to 2007 [Laughter] i mean mmos took off right like that these games keep updating um when they sort of realize that they can make more money through a subscription model than making you make a one-time purchase games with season passes that became the new norm uh and that i think that was a result of phones because a phone will always keep you interested and updated there's always something new you can download so they just met that model yeah um in by no means do i think pokemon snap is bad i think it is yeah absolutely phenomenal incredible worth 60 dollars so glad i was wrong on it um the fact that i ended up putting 80 hours into that game still 200 pictures short of having like all the pictures because it's what like 140 times 4 or something like that 140. how many pokemon in that game 214. oh yeah so it's 214 times 4. yeah so that's what like 800 photos total yeah i'm about 200 shy so i think it's absolutely incredible i'm not surprised that at least according to the 56 856 at least according to this twitter poll that like 20 of people seeing credits that makes sense to me um a bunch of people finishing it yeah i guess i want to go back to your final fantasy don't know where to get in they have fixed that issue there's a thing up in the corner that tells you your main story line where you are in the middle yeah yeah yeah yeah no i was playing the game when it did that it's easy to jump back in it tells you it says hey this is where you were what was your 14 free days till till like august or something well i mean so if you get if you download the game you can play up to level 60 for free yeah i'm already whatever i'm like 65 or whatever right because i remember when the level cap was 70 and i was like just shy of that there's a lot of learning fun the the barrier of final fantasy so high it's not it is really low for a mmo it's really streamlined look i got place i gotta play stories this week at least a little bit okay some sometime unite is coming right we'll we'll try to make it all work are you still on the bad server yeah i never when i read and activated and she moved i i still have not activated i have a 60 day game card that i bought on like clearance one day so i still have that but i can can i move servers on a free trial no we're not a free trial but like the free login period uh i think as long as you pay for it yeah because i think you have to pay to move yeah it's like 10 bucks to move yeah but i think again yeah yeah that's that's fine uh yeah i mean like pokemon snap school uh very good what was your point with this just that you were surprised at how many people finished it and went beyond yeah i i just think how many people claim to have finished it look i'm trying to keep the pokemon snap alive it's like it died it's still right there you know it would bring it back to life a dlc yeah but i don't think the 60 percent of people are to suddenly finish it to get to that dlc maybe like ten percent we'll have to have another poll i'll i'll message jay like hey which would a dlc help you finish the game we need to use your audience again to get these numbers accurate and also please provide your margin of error uh and uh your control for people who didn't make multiple accounts to vote twice no one's making two accounts to vote on a twitter poll about everybody everybody on twitter has their main account their secret account and then their secret secret account so everybody has three this is the rule of twitter secret account i got my personal account and i got my podcast account if anybody wants steve's secret account just message my secret account yeah if you can find my secret account good on you look if you if 60 of people didn't finish the game you're missing the secret path in that snow level holy cow that thing was awesome when you first discover that you're missing the secret secret path in the snow level which is a real thing by the way i'm not making it up you are you're just making things up because there's no nobody can fact check your path in the snow level that's how you get to the suicune uh-huh the sweet coons in the game also i'm 80 hours in the game and the pokemon twitter japanese twitter keeps tweeting all these interactions i've never seen before like what what's happening here like how did you get the crawler to fight the exeggutor how'd you get the brawler to throw sand in the sandy gas and now the sandy gas is bigger like i haven't seen any of these it's because you aren't dedicated to snap like i came in everybody else is all right let's take a break we got all this pokemon go news to talk about for go fest so we will be right back [Music] did you see the things [Music] that is [Music] dynamics [Music] a dynamax band [Music] and we are back from our break uh did we cover this last week i don't think we did i don't know how dates work pokemon go's fifth anniversary event features shawnee daramaka and more celebrate five years no we did not cover this because i think it was on monday yeah it was on monday celebrate five years of fun with flying pikachu and a five shaped balloon first partner pokemon lots more bonuses from tuesday july 6 to thursday july 15th local time you can celebrate um first partner fun means all the starters are back some starters only appear in field research um some but if you don't want to do the field research you could do the lore modules those also help attract you're you're better off using the field research though all right especially because i spent all my lure modules on the last community day wrecking that park yep root in the park for everybody involved you're welcome uh the jumpstart research is back so if you haven't played i have what what is it you haven't played by x amount of time you've got 96 days jump start is it 90 said six months i don't know it's got to say right nah it doesn't say on pokemon.com uh they also increased the item storage limit this week by 500. so if you want to spend what is what is the math on that it's like 50 for two dollars 100 for four dollars you can do that five so 20 bucks to max out your store to increase your storage some more that's how they've been really get you that's the yes dump your great balls they're ugly and yes useless agreed no the great balls are what you use when you you run the pokeball plus and great balls are what you use when you are low on ultra balls like me i'm never low on ultra balls never low and ultra balls i had 400 some altar balls at one point in my life in my goat career and then i used them all on gibbel day i caught a lot of gibbles 400 look i had 600 some pokeballs yesterday and my pokeball plus burned through all 600. well that's your problem you are letting a robot make your decisions that's true that's true but i own decisions turned off the catching on the pokeball plus turned on just the spin and within 30 minutes i was back up to 200 pokeballs that's how you reached life yeah i'm sick of these rural players just burn down your house move to the city you'll never have a pokeball problem again true solution just move just move just spend the new pokemon go amount of five hundred thousand dollars to move into a city and find a place to live and get a new job for pokemon go league the true games the true game starts when you move to the city get with the times city life city pokeballs in 30 minutes find your vacations and your life or on pokemon go to be a true player niantic you're not living on top of a pokestop do you even what are you doing are you even a fan true fans live on a pokestop uh it's it's you can you can't win with people right well you can no you can't you can ask dale carnegie i'm sure he's got something to say on it there's a lot of ways to win so uh for for the for the what do they call that the quest line for the starter quest line where it's like catch all the starters and then you get what like 80 pokeballs and then you get a isn't it the collection challenge collection challenge yeah so it it you you can never win it's either people say the collection challenges are too easy or then they complain they have to leave their house my problem is part of the collection channel challenge is the balloon pikachu right yeah except the only shadow balloon pikachu that shows up on my radar is a three balloons floating the pikachu pikachu it's never a number five pikachu they're all number five well then why is the shadow a three balloon you want nine to make a new shadow for their costume pokemon well obviously i was completely confused and i was like i'm not leaving my house for the three balloon pikachu i'm gonna wait until the five pikachu shows up first off i have five balloons i get foreign because that's the balloon that he's doing no no it's three regular balloons but the five is in front of the regular balloon it's not a good design oh that's fine it's like whatever i'm not trying anyone so i was pretty excited yeah that was the first balloon pikachu the the balloon peach the balloons are fine it's that weird like brace they have around pikachu's waistline that's really weird yeah the five in the in the in the hollow torture device that they have wrapped around his middle it's not great it's like i am surrounded by these balloon pikachus right now so for like uh i think it's the i think it's the johto starters and then i think it's the sinnoh starters are limited to field research and why or you could use lures and and for the most part the field research i i guess i would see the complaints if the field research wasn't easy to get but they're the it's like one of them is get five great throws and the other one is take five snapshots of wild pokemon that's how do i trash no the snapshots is that'll get you like kanto i think canto starters i think the other one is um use five berries i think when catching they're pretty easy but i guess again i live in the city so i i have stops everywhere so if it's one i don't need i just delete it and move on but i mean they're giving you almost two weeks to do it yeah i mean there's plenty of time to find a place to live in the city and move yeah yeah absolutely i believe just like your employment you just give your house two weeks let them know you're out i'm out i've got a new house that i'm moving to so this is my two week notice house um uh hope you live and survive and are happy uh they also rolled out the sunset feature i don't know if you guys have seen that yep it looks good it means when it's sun setting irl it's sun setting in your game and they did the sky weather

again okay oh what is the name of the show it's sidetracked effective it's super sidetracking there okay so i've lived in milwaukee 30 some years right and you know milwaukee has its ups and downs you know at least we're not like michigan uh so we got that going for us yeah and there there is a guy who walks around like the east side of milwaukee and he never has a shirt on he's always wearing jeans wait even in the winter because it gets real cold in the winter look the hibernation exists he's walking this little hibernation exists he has like these sideburns and this wild dark hair wait i think i know that guy and he looks like wolverine yeah and he's seen that guy he's walking a little the best part is not only is he like a ver he's pretty intimidating looking he like he looks like

things you're right especially if you want to book a hotel or a plane ticket pokemon go fest is fastly approaching uh okay so here we go in addition to the details trainers can look forward to the following every trainer will be able to make six special trades each day from friday june 16th starting at 1 p.m to sunday to 11 p.m so that's awesome because i'm getting in minnesota on friday so if we got special trades to do we got to do them pikachu wearing a melowetta inspired hat will be appearing in the wild during event hours on saturday and sunday it will be shiny if you're lucky trainers you're lucky uh during event hours from saturday jul july 17th the following pokemon will be appearing in rates gallerian ponyta anglerian zigzagoon wearing the millet melowetta inspired hats will appear in one star raids as will dino i'm not doing this again no no no i've learned once my antics you got me so look i knew it was going to happen and i still fell for your trick i'm not going to lie this was my fault you put gibbel in raids last year for go fest and i probably spent like 25 dollars which is probably very cheap compared to some of y'all out there bobby and then you see which we all knew google community would eventually come true it was go fest people were inviting me i spent the money i'm not doing it this year greg no i'm not doing a single dinosaur raid i am not doing any dino raids i will wait for the dino go community day and that will be fine they're not niantic you are not getting a dollar for look i might do some ponytails i like hats i'm into the hats i like zigzagoon i like ponyta that's where i'm putting my money okay but no dino uh those will be appearing in one star raids glaring wheezing hitmontop kranidos and three star raids thank you niantic for letting me know i can skip all three star rates cr involve corellia during event hours on saturday and sunday to get a gardevoir that knows synchronize evolving during event hours for a fly gun that knows earth power ticket holders can look forward to the following oh so sorry everything we just read doesn't does it matter if you have a ticket or not you can find your ponytas your zigzagoons your pikachus don't need a ticket for the special trades or what we just read um speaking of tickets if you're listening to this on monday niantic did give me 10 tickets to give away to you guys so if you're into the slack or the discord are on twitter there'll be there'll be a way to try to earn those tickets i know not i know it's only five dollars this year i know some five dollars can be tight for some people or they could be on the fence so we got 10 tickets to give away so if you're listening to the podcast check socials at some point i'm sure i'm sure they'll be up for a way to win those tickets i want to give them to people who listen to the show so alright so if you're a ticket holder certain pokemon during the event will no special attacks please note that only ticket holders will encounter these pokemon you'll have pop star pikachu no name with draining kiss rockstar pikachu with meteor mash pick one you would like as you encounter your special research i think i don't have confirmation here i thought i was told that you will get more of one of these so you could trade to the other person that makes sense um because like yeah if you lock into rockstar i mean you'll have to trade for the other one uh gardevoir will no synchronize flygon will know earth power both will potentially be wearing mellowetta inspired hats as you complete your research you'll be prompted to select which costume pokemon you would like to encounter this decision will determine if you encounter gardevoir wearing a mellowetta inspired hat or a fly gun wearing a mellow hat both pokemon will appear with special research and rewards and if you're lucky you'll be able to attract them with incense the pokemon you don't select will be attracted to incense during the event hours but it won't be wearing a hat okay make sure you snapshot during the event hours by completing your special research in doing so you'll encounter uh either oh so this is what this is how you get more okay i was like i'm pretty sure niantic mentioned that you'll get more so the snapshot will give you more either pop star pikachu and rockstar pikachu depending on your choice so niantic did confirm that they are tradable um uh make sure to encounter during the event i don't know if i guess a costume pikachu would be a special trade because the other person wouldn't have yeah yeah um make sure during your snapshot uh of hours on sunday by doing so you'll get gargoyle flygon with a hat so if you missed some some reason you're playing eight hours on saturday and you miss these hats sunday snapshot they'll be there uh if you're still not sure which pikachu to pick in addition to determining the music for your gofest experience your choice will also give you an avatar trainers who select pop star will get an iconic pose trainers who select rockstar pikachu will get a rockin pose speaking of avatar items uh some exciting music themed items will make their debut in the in-game shop on friday including t-shirts with whismur loudred and explode inspired patterns we've already seen this that's like the original stitch shirts that they're putting in face stickers and guitar case backpack trainers with tickets will also get an exclusive mellowetta shirt once they complete the ex the event special research don't forget the pogo shirt the pokemon go fest avatar shirt is free to everyone whether you have a ticket or not that will be available on friday trainers in the uh united states canada japan can also purchase the real life shirt from pokemon center or wherever japan pokemon center the pokemon centers in japan did we i feel like the pose changes everything because i don't like the rock star pose but i was going to do rock star pikachu because i figured irene wanted pop star pikachu oh i think whether you get flygon or or what was gardevoir was the other option yeah obviously i'm picking whatever's gonna get me a flygon that's rockstar what what what is a melody hat i i i look at it i don't see hat okay it's it's melowetta's face no it's like a little bowler hat what where is the picture of this hat i don't think that i saw the and it's not a bowler it's um it's there's a word for it um yeah i don't know i'm not a hat like the one it's the ones like the cigarette girls used to wear excuse me that's a job on a train for all time yeah you if you go if you go to a pokemon go app on on it kind of looks like a train hat yeah it's like like a train conductor's hat yeah right but not doesn't fit the whole head hill box it's a pillbox hat it's a pillbox got it it's not a great hat it's a cute hat it's okay it's fine pretty cute but what do we what's the other one is it is the same hat for both everything yeah everyone has the hat okay the zigzag and the pony they all have the same hat okay it's cute look you're asking a lot for the 25th anniversary one hat and one had only i mean it's only been 25 years and five years of pokemon go who would have guessed that they would only make one hat with their 5.8 billion dollars they make one hat uh rotating habitat similar to last year uh the themed habitats will rotate in the following order jungle desert mountain not to be confused with desert and mountain desert mountain is one word hey we play magic the gathering we understand how this works ocean beach not to be confused with an ocean and a beach ocean beach is one location and then cave this rotation will begin with the jungle habitat starting in the earliest rotate every hour um so you get every habitat twice uh there will be go fest ultra unlocked trainers who work together in the global arena challenge arena this exclusive feature is only available to ticket holders in the global challenge arena traders will have a chance to join forces in order to compete a collaborative challenge each hour if a trainer completes the challenge they will earn bonuses for the remainder of the hour they did this last year um complete a total of 24 challenges in order to unlock all three so these lead to an ultra unlock so ultra unlock part 1 is time if trainers complete a total of eight global challenges they will gain access to the ultra unlocked part one time the flow of time will be disrupted disrupted pokemon from various eras will appear more often part one will run from july 23rd through august 3rd local time ultra unlock 2 is space okay diablo palkia come on just say it at this point if trainers complete 16 challenges they will unlock ultra unlock part two space as part time one time wraps up we will set our eyes on another dimension counterpart space space itself will be distorted and pokemon from various places will appear space will run from friday august 6 to august 17th and then ultra unlock part 3 question mark question mark question mark so i believe your rival from gold and silver shows up uh yes if you complete 24 global challenges you will unlock part three what will happen when part one and part two is over will these anon abnormal events continue to happen what awaits us during part three stay tuned trainers they don't say uh well because they don't know yeah we don't know we have to yeah we don't know until time and space happen and will we get our ks or will we get giratina or will we get more dioxin or will it be deoxys or will it be uh the combined form of kirim could be anything no it can't be or will it be ho oh and lugia we went through time and space to bring you back ho oh and luna reigns you did it trainers it's mewtwo in the melody hat it's always nice it's always fun luke yeah never not those two you heard it here first the inside scoop all right that's all saturday looks to be a lovely day here at 80 degrees is that sarcasm no it will 88 degrees and partly cloudy that's perfect yeah that's actually real nice and it's like perfect weather um so yeah i i spent a lot of money getting like an unlimited data plan multiple modems to do this like pokemon go backpack and i've been streaming the last week and this upcoming week so the plan is to stream on saturday with greg and will um and just walk around the park and have a good time and i know other people will be playing go as well uh but obviously you could put twitch in audio only mode um and you can listen along or you know if you're playing at home it's kind of it kind of sucks to play at home but i know like not all the world is in a super great place uh some have it better than others for sure so you can have the twitch stream up if no one watches no big deal you know if five people watch and i make those the day for those five people i feel like that's worth it but uh the goal the plan is to stream go fest outside with greg and will on saturday and then sunday we'll probably be at mall of america yep because that's the best place for raids so we won't be streaming that one because that's private property uh so while i don't think mall of america would probably care the music they play in the mall would definitely make twitch care and i don't want to be dmcad for i'm pretty sure mall of america will care so i could probably get by two hours without them noticing i mean i i am obligated to report you as a as you would be that person as a citizen of minnesota all of america ambassador is my legal ambassador to the mall of america in my home estate as much as y'all y'all minnesotans always complain about mall of america but you'll be the first people to be like to be like arrest arrest this outsider get this get this get this filthy interloper out of my mall with his backpack get him out of here yeah get him out but i'll still be in minnesota on monday uh so we'll probably do a like a downtown minnesota stream for pogo on monday downtown minnesota downtown i don't know i'll pick a place downtown minnesota down yeah down all of them crazy stuff happening there there's a question there's some wolverine clone running around straight from canada question of the week all right it's the question of the week question of the week [Music] also uh bobby tone who else is sending in stuff uh andrew you all send in a bunch of like merchandise let's talk about merchandise next week or the week after i don't know well we're gonna have to do it be some time this week when we have nothing to talk about because nothing's coming out who knows i feel like either they're gonna do united or not it's it's just a toss up in the air at this point true uh this is from brandon from our slack what is your favorite and least favorite town in all mainline pokemon games uh my favorite town is pseudopolis always the big crater city that's because you like wallace yeah what is what is your driving factor for your favorite town wait is pseudopolis the one where they have all the hot pea people yes they have all the hot people in where they have all the elderly folks marinating in hot tubs i know there's one town where there's a bunch of people that's like honestly okay the problem with the problem with sudop stupopolis is they have the drought music and there's the worst song in all of pokemon history and when you're in that town when that drought music is playing it is it is soul crushing uh worst is um probably cherry grove city it's boring oh boy yeah there's a lot of bad towns uh there are a lot of bad things it's hard to pick the worst uh but you know as as much as i don't like the gen 2 games i uh there's a gas off spot for goldenrod i like that city a lot yeah is that your favorite city yeah i'm gonna put right now i'm gonna put goldenrod as my number one but there are better large cities bad cities bad city the one in x and y with the first gym leader i can't even remember the city name it's just so blah yeah it's it's it's the it's not really a city it's just like a little town yeah i can't remember the city name [Music] black and white has a well the problem with the x and y town names is that they just they just got too complicated with their aromas and scents and yeah well uh the town that valerie is in uh with the pokeball center that sounds pretty cool santalune city is the first one pokeball factory factory factory santalune city is where viola is but i would argue that aquacord town which is the one before that where nothing happens and you're just by oh is that where you you get the nickname of like little p or big d yes you have to leave your house and you go up to the first town yeah well the very very very very first town that you're in is vandeville town yeah because that's where you live and then you go to [Music] that sort of middle area and then aquacord town and then santalune city and then lumio city which is crash central was lumio city is the worst town why because that map is all like the angles that it points you at it gives you so many options yeah the only option is where's the taxi hop on they give you taxis yeah because you need them what's okay so your favorite town is goldenrod for why why what the golden rod has the radio tower it has the bullet train it has a mall it has a guy telling you the deal like he is nimbasta city has all those and ferris wheels is my favorite nambasa has it all it has a musical theater it has the gear station you want to battle ingo and all his comrades go right on it's got the ferris wheel where you can go on ambiguous dates with people i feel like the ferris wheel brings it down it has the what here's what you forgot it has the weird person where you have to find the exact spot to stand on that they call you up and they're like i'm not going to tell you who i am but keep getting my phone calls and eventually i'll change your special pokemon yeah why don't they do fun stuff like that in pokemon games a city of anymore and love yup oh it has everything and the worst city is uh i think it's for a tree is that the one where you have to like everybody lives up in the trees uh four trees are great you have to keep climbing up and then it's just it's got the castle yeah that blocked the paths the on the blocks nah not past people are too weird change city to location worst location mount cornet all right moving on i'm trying to argue with that and i'm not successful it's hard it is yeah it's certainly so bad okay what's the one in johto though what's the mountain but you don't have to go into it yeah coordinates still worse i will say the tape well i have to agree with you it's the worst it's so it's like oh zuma and psyduck this sucks wait what is the what is the kanto ship is that the ssan ssa yeah yes okay so the implementation of the ssn in let's go pikachu let's go eevee was the worst implementation of any location because if you accidentally spoke to the captain you didn't get to meet and battle any of the trainers i think that's how it worked in um fine yellow worst location because they messed it up i say yeah yeah because that was that weird thing where you could like skip everyone and then the ship leaves and you're like all that money and experience i need to fleece all these people with my high powered pokemon how am i suppected to live what's our youtube ah let's do hannah this week okay which pokemon if turned into a building would be at least structurally integra integral as an example because it's an odd question doraldon and charger bug will be very integral given their overall body shapes well they have the best integrity not integral those words mean different things uh carnivore carnivine it is a bit wiggly at the bottom isn't it it's very top-heavy and has very very very bad structure would it not be spoink see no because spoink has flow you can attach you can attach the spring also spoink is about the same shape as its uh spring it's it's balanced and the real answer is uh grimer you can't you just can't you can't you can you can't turn that into a building uh spritzy spritzy's only on two tiny tiny little legs with a really really big yeah but see like architects like to be all fancy and be like look at how big i can put this thing on top of something so spindly and small that's true what about spinda very wobbly i think that's like yeah intentionally designed to collapse at some point yeah because like at least would be good in an earthquake because don't they put springs in the bottom of like japanese buildings uh they put springs in the bottoms of lots of buildings where they places are prone to earthquakes yes although springs i don't think is the word for it i think something more like a cantilever is probably what you're thinking of uh oh god somebody call up the salesforce tower in san francisco see how they built that not a lot of balance i feel like when you think of not a lot of balance you think spinda i mean agreed but also cure them because kieran's always like half one thing never the other half yeah what about drake algae uh well see the thing is that's like a floating water platform that could actually work yeah it's got the pods it's got yeah it's got them got a lot of pods uh i'm trying to think if there's anything porygon z a porganzi would be terrible nothing in that building would work nothing no you know what uh spirit tomb because it'd be like it looks like it's a solid rock building you go in there and you never come out you're dead uh i feel like gia ju would be solid because it just has to say yeah yeah i do do probably pretty solid i feel like most rock pokemon yeah you'd be pretty all right with yeah chandelier how about lampant palace and that's a good one yeah that's a solid that's not in the anime they said they were inside the palace and it was pretty solid that's what i'm saying that would be a good one not a bad yeah yeah yeah sand is a strong yeah i think so baby would be fine because it's got that whole stem that would be fun yeah and that's another like the architect wants to prove that they can balance a top-heavy building it's kind of mine yeah probably carnivale carnivate's the worst chat top maybe nah chad chad is a rock museum rock hall of fame yeah uh well pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon uh this was i i couldn't have made it easier for you uh i referenced it it comes it's one of the pokemon that's available as a playable character in super smash brothers ultimate so not one of the side pokemon that you can't play as um two of those characters could be say it could be said to have uh the same career possibly which i know that confused some people but whatever um but it's one of those ones and it's the one whose up special move could accidentally cause you to fall off a platform if you don't aim it properly or let me put it this way because that was all the distracting stuff that i put in to make it harder for people who don't listen to every word um the appropriate sentence was in the popular home video game series uh two of the playable characters derived from sibling nintendo based home video game series pokemon sun and pokemon moon can be said to potentially share a career you guys don't know any of the playable characters from super smash i i think i know who it is maybe incineroar yeah is it incineroar it's incineroar yes because there is a luchador pikachu in smash brothers and incineroar is a wrestler but all you had to do i think incineroar is the only sun and moon pokemon in super smash brothers uh i think so because i know greninja is in there as a playable you got the pikachu you got the jigglypuff kirby got the mewtwo yeah i love kirby my favorite pokemon [Laughter] uh i like incineroar real good real good shiny i think i have to look it up i have to see it does it even have a shuffle icon yeah sure yeah it does it's pretty good senora's all right well how do you feel about incineroar uh not my first choice for a pokemon but i mean it's not the worst of all the pokemon oh the shuffle icons are real good it's got that it's got that look on his face well because it's the heel pokemon it is the heel also the shiny is one of the better shinies that exist it's a good shiny the white tiger is outstanding i did a whole video on why instant aurora is the way incineroar is on youtube don't roll your eyes are you a trying guy to be a heel they only do it because that's where the money is for the money is insider are still the number one pokemon competitive as well it's real good got a good moveset good typing got good ability just lines up is the only evolved form of a starter pokemon we have a lower base debt than its pre-evolved forms interesting its speed set is 30 points lower than torah cats and 10 points lower than litten it's a slow slow slow tiger what about use it with trick room no you don't use the center ticker don't even sit down considering it's a combination of incinerate and roar who would have guessed uh what's next week all right here we go just plowing forward as part of the celebration of pokemon go's fifth anniversary rather than making the 555th pokemon appear in the wild they have made one of its pre-evolutions the 554th pokemon appear and is now potentially catchable as a shiny if this trend continues next year the promoted pokemon may make you feel a little sick to your stomach that's what you get that's it i think i know what it is [Laughter] uh thank you for listening uh the podcast awards are back nominations are now
