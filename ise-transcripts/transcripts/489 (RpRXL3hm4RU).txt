for the (1:12 - 1:15)
pokemon brilliant diamond and shining (1:13 - 1:18)
pearl uh those episodes are now out on (1:15 - 1:20)
whatever (1:18 - 1:21)
platform you're using to listen to this (1:20 - 1:23)

you're listening to youtube (1:24 - 1:28)
um they're not on youtube no there was (1:25 - 1:30)
no video to them there's video to this (1:28 - 1:34)
uh and so each episode was the gym so (1:30 - 1:36)
that's eight gyms spoiler that there's (1:34 - 1:37)
eight gyms in the game and then the last (1:36 - 1:39)
episode was the elite four and final (1:37 - 1:42)
thoughts uh which came out sunday aka (1:39 - 1:43)
yesterday if you're listening to this on (1:42 - 1:46)
monday with that being said those are (1:43 - 1:48)
all spoilery they talk about the gym the (1:46 - 1:50)
gym leaders the spoilery for a 15 year (1:48 - 1:52)
old game (1:50 - 1:54)
and then like our thoughts on that so (1:52 - 1:56)
we're not gonna spend today's episode (1:54 - 1:58)
talking about that stuff so if you're (1:56 - 2:00)
still working through (1:58 - 2:01)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl you (2:00 - 2:02)
don't have to worry about that kind of (2:01 - 2:04)
stuff uh we may talk about the (2:02 - 2:05)
underground because we have a news (2:04 - 2:08)
article related to the underground um (2:05 - 2:09)
but i don't think that's (2:08 - 2:11)
too spoilery because you get the (2:09 - 2:13)
internet there's an underground you get (2:11 - 2:15)
it real real early yeah yeah like the (2:13 - 2:17)
second gym so that was in the previews (2:15 - 2:18)
also (2:17 - 2:19)
yeah (2:18 - 2:21)
um so that's kind of the the game plan (2:19 - 2:22)
for today we're just going to focus on (2:21 - 2:24)
pokemon news and then probably next week (2:22 - 2:25)
maybe we'll go a little bit more in (2:24 - 2:26)
depth with (2:25 - 2:29)
more diamond and pearl stuff since (2:26 - 2:31)
er game's been out for over a week now (2:29 - 2:33)
so (2:31 - 2:34)
how time works is it'll be two weeks (2:33 - 2:36)
next week (2:34 - 2:38)
let's start off with the real exciting (2:36 - 2:40)
news that no one (2:38 - 2:41)
really (2:40 - 2:44)
is excited for or if they were they (2:41 - 2:46)
planned it on the same day a new game (2:44 - 2:48)
came out decidueye (2:46 - 2:51)
is now in pokemon unite (2:48 - 2:52)
yup (2:51 - 2:54)
and that's about (2:52 - 2:57)
all that people okay yep that's that is (2:54 - 3:01)
it broken is it overpowered is it (2:57 - 3:03)
do you get to start as a rowlet unite (3:01 - 3:04)
you start as a rowlet and go up but (3:03 - 3:07)
united unite is broken for a lot of (3:04 - 3:10)
people and no longer fun to play (3:07 - 3:12)
i don't know if it's broken for a lot of (3:10 - 3:16)
people i think they did fix greedon (3:12 - 3:16)
maybe (3:18 - 3:21)
i mean even anybody i know who's a (3:19 - 3:25)
hardcore unite player is like nah (3:21 - 3:27)
i'm not playing right now (3:25 - 3:28)
yeah (3:27 - 3:30)
i mean part of the problem is diamond (3:28 - 3:33)
pearl just came out (3:30 - 3:34)
uh (3:33 - 3:37)
other part of the problem is (3:34 - 3:39)
greed it ruined the game for a lot of (3:37 - 3:40)
people (3:39 - 3:42)
yep (3:40 - 3:42)
and for whatever reason the wanting to (3:43 - 3:50)
release decidueye the same day as these (3:46 - 3:52)
brand new games just seemed (3:50 - 3:55)
like i understand we've said this before (3:52 - 3:57)
not everyone plays (3:55 - 3:59)
unite not everyone plays the tcg not (3:57 - 4:01)
everyone plays pokemon go not everyone (3:59 - 4:04)
plays diamond and pearl main series (4:01 - 4:06)
games whatever you want to call them (4:04 - 4:08)
still think putting that all in the same (4:06 - 4:11)
weekend is not a good choice (4:08 - 4:11)
i mean it's just a lot on one weekend (4:14 - 4:19)
and (4:17 - 4:19)
leading into how broken unite was (4:20 - 4:24)
leading into this release i was like i (4:22 - 4:26)
really like decidueye but there's no way (4:24 - 4:28)
i'm going back to that game (4:26 - 4:30)
right now like i may (4:28 - 4:32)
later when (4:30 - 4:34)
when things have maybe calmed down and (4:32 - 4:36)
things aren't (4:34 - 4:39)
so horribly broken and everybody that i (4:36 - 4:40)
enjoyed playing with is like i don't (4:39 - 4:42)
want to play that game right now we had (4:40 - 4:44)
community day this weekend too that's (4:42 - 4:47)
right yeah (4:44 - 4:47)
yeah we did yeah we had community day (4:47 - 4:53)
that that what was the 21st (4:50 - 4:54)
yep (4:53 - 4:54)
yeah (4:54 - 4:56)
the sunday i got a bunch of things at (4:54 - 4:57)
the mall (4:56 - 5:00)
i was out getting waffles (4:57 - 5:00)
yeah you feel like there has been shield (5:03 - 5:08)
i don't i don't know what unite has to (5:06 - 5:11)
do to get people excited (5:08 - 5:13)
or to bring people back i don't know if (5:11 - 5:15)
that's like (5:13 - 5:18)
a big update or a new map or to just (5:15 - 5:22)
flip out zapdos for articuno or (5:18 - 5:25)
give a bunch of login gems i don't know (5:22 - 5:26)
what the (5:25 - 5:28)
i mean i think they're fighting an (5:26 - 5:31)
uphill battle of (5:28 - 5:31)
a lot of people who really like playing (5:32 - 5:36)
the game got so turned off of it that (5:33 - 5:38)
they aren't even talking about it (5:36 - 5:38)
anymore (5:38 - 5:41)
and so if you know people (5:38 - 5:43)
aren't enjoying it or when you talk to (5:41 - 5:45)
these people who were excited about it (5:43 - 5:46)
and their first words are oh it's so (5:45 - 5:49)
broken i (5:46 - 5:51)
like they have to do something to change (5:49 - 5:54)
the perception that the game is bad (5:51 - 5:56)
yeah it may be too late right because (5:54 - 5:58)
part of the problem is it's not a unique (5:56 - 6:00)
game style so if you're playing because (5:58 - 6:02)
you like that game style you're going to (6:00 - 6:04)
play one of the more mature (6:02 - 6:07)
yeah types of that and if you're playing (6:04 - 6:11)
because it was like hey it's pokemon (6:07 - 6:13)
and then you find out it's broken which (6:11 - 6:15)
like right that's what turns off a lot (6:13 - 6:19)
of turns people off of vgc is hey you (6:15 - 6:21)
have to use the same everybody's using (6:19 - 6:23)
the same six pokemon it's not i get to (6:21 - 6:25)
use the fun pokemon i want so if unites (6:23 - 6:26)
the same way (6:25 - 6:29)
where it's you've got to use greedent (6:26 - 6:30)
then i'm not that's not the game i'm (6:29 - 6:32)
going to play (6:30 - 6:35)
like yeah you had to use greedon (6:32 - 6:37)
yeah i had to play in a very specific (6:35 - 6:38)
way (6:37 - 6:41)
i i was invited to twitch rivals we (6:38 - 6:43)
talked about twitch rivals before for (6:41 - 6:45)
pogo twitch rivals reached out to me for (6:43 - 6:47)
unite (6:45 - 6:48)
and so they picked (6:47 - 6:51)
i think there's 20 streamers (6:48 - 6:53)
i'm one of the 20 (6:51 - 6:54)
and (6:53 - 6:56)
uh (6:54 - 6:59)
and the they picked some really really (6:56 - 7:01)
great players and then they picked some (6:59 - 7:02)
popular streamers and then they picked (7:01 - 7:04)
some then they picked me so i'm not (7:02 - 7:06)
really good or i'm not popular so i (7:04 - 7:08)
don't know how i got picked but uh they (7:06 - 7:11)
picked me and then they delayed it so it (7:08 - 7:12)
was actually supposed to happen last (7:11 - 7:15)
week now i think it happens on december (7:12 - 7:17)
2nd and there's like twenty thousand (7:15 - 7:19)
dollars in prize money you know if you (7:17 - 7:21)
if if you win (7:19 - 7:23)
that twenty thousand dollars gets split (7:21 - 7:25)
up you know second place gets less money (7:23 - 7:27)
that's how tournaments work (7:25 - 7:28)
and one of the other people in the (7:27 - 7:32)
tournament they came into my twitch chat (7:28 - 7:35)
and they were like (7:32 - 7:35)
do you (7:35 - 7:38)
they they were asking me questions about (7:36 - 7:38)
like (7:38 - 7:40)
like unite they were because they were (7:38 - 7:42)
also a united player they were like hey (7:40 - 7:44)
did you like have you recently played (7:42 - 7:45)
since (7:44 - 7:47)
decidueye and i was like oh i haven't (7:45 - 7:49)
played since greeden (7:47 - 7:51)
and they were like oh you're not going (7:49 - 7:53)
to practice for the tournament (7:51 - 7:55)
and i was like well first off the (7:53 - 7:57)
tournament is on mobile i've never (7:55 - 7:59)
played on mobile (7:57 - 8:00)
secondly (7:59 - 8:02)
they picked the five best players in the (8:00 - 8:05)
world on the leaderboard for season one (8:02 - 8:08)
um i know i can't beat them i'm hoping (8:05 - 8:10)
one or two are on my team of course (8:08 - 8:12)
because if they put all five on his team (8:10 - 8:14)
we'll kawaii even bother playing at that (8:12 - 8:15)
point (8:14 - 8:16)
and (8:15 - 8:18)
i was like i'm just going to go in with (8:16 - 8:20)
cramer ant (8:18 - 8:22)
and i'm going to have fun because that's (8:20 - 8:24)
why that's why this whole thing exists (8:22 - 8:27)
like they're taking good players they're (8:24 - 8:28)
taking really good players and they're (8:27 - 8:31)
taking other players and they're mixing (8:28 - 8:32)
them together and it's supposed to be (8:31 - 8:33)
like a four-hour thing on the front page (8:32 - 8:36)
of twitch and it's supposed to be fun (8:33 - 8:37)
and the the thing they said was well (8:36 - 8:41)
cram memorands not meta (8:37 - 8:44)
i don't care like exactly that's what (8:41 - 8:47)
they're not getting i have 600 games in (8:44 - 8:50)
cramer ant no like maybe four games in (8:47 - 8:52)
zero aura like (8:50 - 8:54)
like i (8:52 - 8:57)
even what am i supposed to do suddenly (8:54 - 8:58)
learn how to play this game on mobile (8:57 - 9:00)
with a character that i don't really (8:58 - 9:02)
care to play to like try to even come (9:00 - 9:05)
close to these people playing at such a (9:02 - 9:07)
high level if i've learned anything from (9:05 - 9:09)
twitch rivals (9:07 - 9:11)
like i won almost every single i lost (9:09 - 9:13)
one of my matches i won every single one (9:11 - 9:15)
of my matches in twitch rivals for (9:13 - 9:18)
pokemon go and my team came in last why (9:15 - 9:20)
because it's a team-based game i can't (9:18 - 9:21)
control (9:20 - 9:24)
their rng i can control (9:21 - 9:26)
how they performed or played i did my (9:24 - 9:28)
part (9:26 - 9:30)
and our team still came in last like i i (9:28 - 9:32)
was like one of two people that only (9:30 - 9:35)
lost one match that entire time so (9:32 - 9:36)
um (9:35 - 9:38)
i don't know (9:36 - 9:40)
i i don't think that twitch rivals is (9:38 - 9:43)
gonna suddenly increase the excitement (9:40 - 9:44)
for pokemon unite (9:43 - 9:47)
but you don't know (9:44 - 9:48)
um (9:47 - 9:50)
i just i just want to go in have fun (9:48 - 9:52)
with crime rat (9:50 - 9:55)
hopefully win some money and then you (9:52 - 9:58)
know wait patiently for (9:55 - 9:59)
people to get a little bit bored with (9:58 - 10:01)
diamond and pearl and then for unite to (9:59 - 10:03)
do something exciting i (10:01 - 10:04)
don't (10:03 - 10:06)
know if that second part is going to (10:04 - 10:09)
happen i think it's i think it's very (10:06 - 10:10)
common for people to be like all right (10:09 - 10:11)
played this game for two weeks what's (10:10 - 10:14)
new somewhere else i don't know if it's (10:11 - 10:15)
i don't know if unites gonna be like hey (10:14 - 10:18)
we got something big come on back to the (10:15 - 10:21)
game i don't know what that looks like (10:18 - 10:23)
but i think they need to do something (10:21 - 10:25)
you better win because i'm really (10:23 - 10:26)
counting on that christmas bonus this (10:25 - 10:29)

for walking or running because it will (12:26 - 12:31)
push your body forward so you put a lot (12:28 - 12:32)
of stress on the front of your foot so (12:31 - 12:34)
chuck taylor is a popular bodybuilding (12:32 - 12:37)

so terrified (12:44 - 12:48)
of dropping something on my foot oh dude (12:46 - 12:49)

pokemon everybody else is like this is a (14:25 - 14:29)
track that's not good enough to go on (14:27 - 14:30)
any of my main albums we're going to (14:29 - 14:33)
toss it to this one if one song on an (14:30 - 14:35)

correct (14:37 - 14:39)

that i was going to do the spotlight (27:54 - 27:59)
hour at noon yesterday (27:56 - 28:01)
and there was a car crash in front of my (27:59 - 28:04)
house oh that was like the weirdest and (28:01 - 28:07)
yet also most disastrous car crash and (28:04 - 28:10)
it made me completely forget (28:07 - 28:10)
that i could have been getting them (28:10 - 28:13)
stabilized which are dark and ghosts (28:10 - 28:15)
covered both i completed that yesterday (28:13 - 28:17)
during the disability event now i have (28:15 - 28:19)
to do all this team rocket stuff and i'm (28:17 - 28:20)
like oh this is never gonna happen (28:19 - 28:22)
petition (28:20 - 28:25)
niantic to to have a redo (28:22 - 28:28)
on the stabilized spotlight hour because (28:25 - 28:32)
that car crash got me real (28:28 - 28:32)
bad car crash (28:32 - 28:35)
[Applause] (28:36 - 28:40)
i did complete it yesterday with (28:38 - 28:42)
stabilized spotlight hour yesterday at (28:40 - 28:44)
noon but now the new thing is hey guess (28:42 - 28:46)
what you have to do team rocket stuff (28:44 - 28:47)
and i'm like well (28:46 - 28:49)
well that's out the window i would (28:47 - 28:51)
rather pay five dollars to never do team (28:49 - 28:54)
rocket again i'll tell you that much (28:51 - 28:57)
and here's the thing i don't care about (28:54 - 29:01)
hoopa unbound who i i am level 47 or (28:57 - 29:04)
something in pogo there's a one point (29:01 - 29:06)
maybe 44 you have to do like (29:04 - 29:09)
100 rocket battles and 50 liters which (29:06 - 29:11)
is more than 100 rocket (29:09 - 29:13)
battles uh (29:11 - 29:14)
and then you have to do something else (29:13 - 29:15)
with rocket (29:14 - 29:17)
i never (29:15 - 29:20)
want to do rocket stuff again (29:17 - 29:21)
i just (29:20 - 29:22)
no (29:21 - 29:25)
i would rather do go battle league for (29:22 - 29:28)
the rest of my life than to do (29:25 - 29:30)
another 20 rocket battles (29:28 - 29:33)
they're not fun (29:30 - 29:33)
they're they're not (29:33 - 29:38)
i forgot all about stabilize spotlight (29:36 - 29:42)
hour but like why save say they (29:38 - 29:43)
i am (29:42 - 29:45)
stabilized the stabilized spotlight hour (29:43 - 29:47)
exists because they knew people were (29:45 - 29:49)
going to get stuck um to catch the 30 (29:47 - 29:50)
and catch (29:49 - 29:53)
the the 30 dark and the 30 ghost if they (29:50 - 29:54)
didn't get to that step until after (29:53 - 29:57)
halloween so why wait three days before (29:54 - 30:00)
the reset because now you're i don't (29:57 - 30:01)
know what comes after the rocket stuff (30:00 - 30:03)
but rocket stuff is also time consuming (30:01 - 30:05)
you have to leave and find them and do (30:03 - 30:06)
it (30:05 - 30:08)
it's not like (30:06 - 30:11)
why why save it to last minute i think i (30:08 - 30:13)
was understood pokemon go players why (30:11 - 30:15)
would they why would why was this not a (30:13 - 30:17)
week before diamond on pearl (30:15 - 30:19)
because again now diamond pearl is out (30:17 - 30:20)
people want to play that (30:19 - 30:22)
yeah (30:20 - 30:23)
i'm surprised because i actually was (30:22 - 30:25)
kind of expecting you to do the sableye (30:23 - 30:26)
spotlight hour as part of your stream (30:25 - 30:28)
like just like at noon (30:26 - 30:30)
yeah i should have pulled it up for a (30:28 - 30:30)
little bit because i did that with (30:30 - 30:32)
shanks and it was pretty (30:30 - 30:34)
easy to do both but (30:32 - 30:36)
like that's like again then we would (30:34 - 30:37)
have gotten to like (30:36 - 30:39)
rock it (30:37 - 30:41)
and it's like (30:39 - 30:41)
it's bad timing on my part i just moved (30:42 - 30:45)
here i haven't even lived in this house (30:44 - 30:47)
for a month and i'm just like this is my (30:45 - 30:51)
first weekend i feel like i'm (30:47 - 30:51)
able to like maybe take a little bit of (30:51 - 30:55)
time and just relax (30:54 - 30:58)
and it's like do i want to go outside in (30:55 - 31:00)
21 degrees weather to find a rocket or (30:58 - 31:01)
do i want to like (31:00 - 31:02)
oh my god (31:01 - 31:04)
i know where all the the team rocket (31:02 - 31:06)
folks hang out in their downtime so you (31:04 - 31:08)
just take you to one place and you just (31:06 - 31:10)
get them all (31:08 - 31:10)
but it's it's a it's a it's (31:11 - 31:15)
it's a spooky part of town so be (31:13 - 31:17)
prepared to rumble (31:15 - 31:19)
how rude to call north minneapolis a (31:17 - 31:21)
spooky part of town wow i wasn't (31:19 - 31:24)
referring to north minneapolis oh (31:21 - 31:26)
uh this area around this house in (31:24 - 31:28)
richfield that's real (31:26 - 31:30)
you got that right it just spontaneously (31:28 - 31:34)
generates car accidents (31:30 - 31:34)
is there a listing of what all the (31:35 - 31:40)
special research are somewhere (31:37 - 31:41)
there's gotta be right yeah there's (31:40 - 31:42)
websites that post it all i'm sure (31:41 - 31:45)
silvroate has everything yeah are you (31:42 - 31:47)
going to try to finish it no i'm just (31:45 - 31:49)
curious what comes after the team rocket (31:47 - 31:50)
there's no way (31:49 - 31:53)
i am going out (31:50 - 31:55)
to search (31:53 - 31:58)
for team rocket there's no (31:55 - 32:01)
there's no part of my brain (31:58 - 32:03)
that says do this i mean i realize i'm (32:01 - 32:05)
on step 15 of 16 (32:03 - 32:08)
but it's five go rocket (32:05 - 32:10)
grunts (32:08 - 32:11)
then a (32:10 - 32:15)
team leader and then the boss (32:11 - 32:17)
which is like six too many (32:15 - 32:19)
and technically because then i think (32:17 - 32:21)
that's 15 out of 16 and then i would be (32:19 - 32:22)
done and i would be able to get the (32:21 - 32:25)
thing but the thought (32:22 - 32:28)
of going out into the world today (32:25 - 32:30)
to try to find (32:28 - 32:33)
team rocket people (32:30 - 32:37)
enough that i can complete this (32:33 - 32:37)
makes me internally sad (32:37 - 32:44)
yeah the problem is that you know (32:40 - 32:45)
with the timing you were supposed to hit (32:44 - 32:46)
that (32:45 - 32:48)
around uh when they were having the (32:46 - 32:51)
diwali celebrations and they were having (32:48 - 32:53)
that like the team rocket take over (32:51 - 32:55)
a couple of weeks ago (32:53 - 32:57)
yeah it didn't happen it's not going to (32:55 - 33:00)
happen now (32:57 - 33:01)
and here's the thing i look at it like (33:00 - 33:03)
well it's only five (33:01 - 33:04)
and then i mean like well the one that i (33:03 - 33:07)
do will be so bad that i'm like there's (33:04 - 33:08)
no (33:07 - 33:09)
there's no possible way i want to (33:08 - 33:11)
continue doing so the the hoopa quest (33:09 - 33:14)
though is in the (33:11 - 33:16)
i think what throws me off is they they (33:14 - 33:18)
put the hoopa quest (33:16 - 33:20)
in the special research (33:18 - 33:22)
and those are permanent (33:20 - 33:23)
yeah (33:22 - 33:26)
so at some point (33:23 - 33:28)
like like the mish understood mischief (33:26 - 33:30)
isn't going to disappear i'll still be (33:28 - 33:32)
able to finish it what if they didn't (33:30 - 33:33)
eat it (33:32 - 33:35)
what did they reach into your case that (33:33 - 33:36)
would be the first time they would (33:35 - 33:38)
delete something in special i'm all (33:36 - 33:39)
right i'm well aware (33:38 - 33:42)
rocket balloon just appeared above my (33:39 - 33:44)
you battle that team rocket grunt right (33:42 - 33:45)
now i'm gonna do it right now let's see (33:44 - 33:48)
so eventually i will finish it but what (33:45 - 33:49)
they're saying is if it's not done (33:48 - 33:51)
before the first (33:49 - 33:53)
then you don't get the hoopa yeah you do (33:51 - 33:55)
you have to pay to unlock the other one (33:53 - 33:57)
yeah which i think is kind of (33:55 - 33:59)
bad bogus (33:57 - 34:02)
it's a bogus way to have run when all (33:59 - 34:04)
the other ones were like hey complete (34:02 - 34:05)
this when you can and you'd still unlock (34:04 - 34:09)
it this one like nope like why mischief (34:05 - 34:11)
means money it's still it's along the (34:09 - 34:15)
same way as uh pokemon go day for 2020 (34:11 - 34:18)
where i like didn't log in so i don't i (34:15 - 34:19)
didn't get that (34:18 - 34:20)
adventure (34:19 - 34:23)
yeah i mean that was also bogus (34:20 - 34:26)
word of the show bogus (34:23 - 34:26)
i'm still tapping i'm taking them down (34:27 - 34:32)
yeah take them down i'm still on search (34:30 - 34:33)
for zarud what i gotta do (34:32 - 34:36)
take three snapshots of flying pokemon (34:33 - 34:39)
well i'll do that eventually (34:36 - 34:39)
oh yeah i'm supposed to have been taking (34:41 - 34:44)
pictures of ground type wild ground type (34:42 - 34:46)
pokemon can i get a wild ground type (34:44 - 34:48)
pokemon to show up at my house all i got (34:46 - 34:51)
is benearies and uh i got a tangle up (34:48 - 34:53)
popping up right now that's not a ground (34:51 - 34:54)
type (34:53 - 34:57)
it's on the ground what's that nosy dude (34:54 - 34:58)
uh (34:57 - 35:00)
no (34:58 - 35:00)
one that smells a lot (35:01 - 35:08)
rubbish no like perfume (35:04 - 35:09)
aroma (35:08 - 35:12)
spritzy (35:09 - 35:14)
got a lot of them hanging out (35:12 - 35:15)
let's take a (35:14 - 35:17)
break when we come back we got some more (35:15 - 35:20)
pokemon news and uh we'll see you on the (35:17 - 35:22)
other side (35:20 - 35:24)
like that and then if it was four away (35:22 - 35:27)
it would be like 95 (35:24 - 35:30)
so you (35:27 - 35:30)
[Music] (35:41 - 35:47)
just do it chat just keep doing it as (35:43 - 35:50)
fast as possible don't think about it (35:47 - 35:52)
just go go go go go this is how you do (35:50 - 35:54)
radar you just go (35:52 - 35:57)
hard as fast as possible don't even (35:54 - 36:01)
think about the chain just move (35:57 - 36:01)
it's a girl (36:02 - 36:05)
and we are back from our break (36:07 - 36:11)
there is uh (36:11 - 36:15)
i'm gonna talk about a little bit of (36:14 - 36:17)
diamond and pearl stuff here uh (36:15 - 36:18)
specifically the grand underground if (36:17 - 36:21)
you go to diamondpearl.pokemon.com (36:18 - 36:23)
uh there's a like trainer guide that (36:21 - 36:25)
they have up here (36:23 - 36:26)
um and so we're going to go through the (36:25 - 36:27)
first part of the trainer guide the (36:26 - 36:29)
second part which is super contest comes (36:27 - 36:32)
out on november 29th and then completing (36:29 - 36:36)
the pokedex comes out on december 3rd (36:32 - 36:38)
why i think these trainer guides are (36:36 - 36:40)
important is because this is when they (36:38 - 36:43)
started talking about um (36:40 - 36:44)
like shiny hunting and things that are (36:43 - 36:48)
exclusive to the games (36:44 - 36:49)
so at least the pokemon company (36:48 - 36:52)
international (36:49 - 36:54)
which would be what we read from on a (36:52 - 36:56)
weekly basis pokemon.com not to be (36:54 - 36:58)
confused with the pokemon company which (36:56 - 36:59)
is in japan (36:58 - 37:00)
uh (36:59 - 37:02)
the first time they really mentioned (37:00 - 37:04)
shinyhunting (37:02 - 37:06)
on pokemon.com (37:04 - 37:07)
from (37:06 - 37:08)
from a game from a main series game (37:07 - 37:11)
perspective was back in (37:08 - 37:13)
ultrasound ultraman (37:11 - 37:16)
where they they explained (37:13 - 37:19)
sos and how you can get good ivs in sos (37:16 - 37:20)
and how that can lead to finding shiny (37:19 - 37:22)
pokemon (37:20 - 37:23)
and then (37:22 - 37:24)
they did this again with let's go (37:23 - 37:26)
pikachu let's go eevee i'm pretty sure (37:24 - 37:28)
the title of that article was keep that (37:26 - 37:30)
catch combo going (37:28 - 37:31)
talked about how to get candy how to (37:30 - 37:33)
make it easier to catch pokemon how (37:31 - 37:35)
shiny pokemon would appear (37:33 - 37:37)
and then they did it again for sword and (37:35 - 37:38)
shield (37:37 - 37:39)
this is what we've been talking about (37:38 - 37:41)
prior to diamond and pearl where i (37:39 - 37:43)
believe the title of that article was (37:41 - 37:46)
finding brilliant pokemon (37:43 - 37:49)
leads to something or something about (37:46 - 37:52)
brilliant pokemon in the wild area (37:49 - 37:53)
and that article also talked about shiny (37:52 - 37:56)
hunting um and then that article was the (37:53 - 37:59)
big point of debate of well this doesn't (37:56 - 38:00)
line up with serebii (37:59 - 38:02)
and then we found out that serbia was (38:00 - 38:03)
wrong for two years and that that (38:02 - 38:06)
article was actually correct it just was (38:03 - 38:09)
very vague in a specific spot which was (38:06 - 38:12)
specifically this applies to brilliant (38:09 - 38:14)
pokemon not all pokemon (38:12 - 38:17)
um but now in retrospect when you read (38:14 - 38:19)
it you're like (38:17 - 38:21)
yeah that that makes sense (38:19 - 38:23)
yeah (38:21 - 38:23)
so i would assume that there's gonna be (38:25 - 38:29)
something coming out for brilliant (38:27 - 38:32)
diamond shining pearl (38:29 - 38:33)
but (38:32 - 38:34)
we'll wait (38:33 - 38:36)
on that (38:34 - 38:39)
they did release a trainer guide for the (38:36 - 38:42)
underground (38:39 - 38:42)
uh you can explore you can start (38:42 - 38:46)
exploring the grand underground when you (38:44 - 38:48)
reach eterna city simply speak to the (38:46 - 38:51)
underground man wow what a name (38:48 - 38:53)
at his home next door he didn't give (38:51 - 38:55)
himself that name people started calling (38:53 - 38:57)
him that because he was the first person (38:55 - 38:59)
to dig out the (38:57 - 39:01)
underground uh (38:59 - 39:03)
eterna it's so the the the building is (39:01 - 39:06)
the one next to eterna's pokemon center (39:03 - 39:09)
you will get the explorer kit (39:06 - 39:10)
um (39:09 - 39:13)
he will offer you four short missions (39:10 - 39:14)
after you complete each task you can (39:13 - 39:17)
revisit the underground man to receive (39:14 - 39:19)
your next (39:17 - 39:21)
request plus your reward for a job well (39:19 - 39:22)
done (39:21 - 39:26)
so the missions are use the explorer kit (39:22 - 39:27)
dig up an object (39:26 - 39:29)
make a secret base (39:27 - 39:32)
and decorate your secret base (39:29 - 39:32)
and we're 25 years into the series and (39:33 - 39:37)
they're still not like a (39:35 - 39:39)
actual checklist for these like side (39:37 - 39:41)
quests they have you do (39:39 - 39:43)
nope (39:41 - 39:45)
just remember (39:43 - 39:48)
there are zones of the underground (39:45 - 39:50)
um there's many tunnels caves and (39:48 - 39:52)
caverns they're (39:50 - 39:55)
divided into seven zones when you first (39:52 - 39:57)
use the explorer kit in alternate city (39:55 - 39:58)
you will (39:57 - 39:59)
you will arrive in the sprawling section (39:58 - 40:01)
of the ground (39:59 - 40:03)
the grand underground comprised of two (40:01 - 40:04)
connecting parts the eastern zone and (40:03 - 40:06)
the western zone (40:04 - 40:08)
stretching both sides of cinno these (40:06 - 40:12)
zones contain no fewer than 26 hideaways (40:08 - 40:14)
spanning nine terrains (40:12 - 40:16)
along with three vendors who will (40:14 - 40:19)
happily exchange spheres for useful (40:16 - 40:22)
items you've collected (40:19 - 40:22)
uh while varied the eastern and western (40:23 - 40:29)
zones caverns do not include every type (40:26 - 40:31)
of terrain so there is limits to what (40:29 - 40:32)
you can find (40:31 - 40:34)
to see everything in the ground (40:32 - 40:36)
underground you have to find a way into (40:34 - 40:37)
the central zone (40:36 - 40:39)
the northwest stern zone the (40:37 - 40:42)
northeastern zone the south western zone (40:39 - 40:44)
they named these very well the (40:42 - 40:46)
southeastern zone to reach a specific (40:44 - 40:48)
zone you'll have to use the explorer kit (40:46 - 40:50)
from different areas of the re cinna (40:48 - 40:52)
region surface many of these zones are (40:50 - 40:56)
only accessible from a specific location (40:52 - 40:57)
and there's actually a little guide (40:56 - 40:58)
right here so (40:57 - 41:00)
if you want eastern or western zones you (40:58 - 41:02)
can do eterna city heart home city veil (41:00 - 41:04)
stone if you want the central zone that (41:02 - 41:06)
is specifically celeste town (41:04 - 41:09)
if you want the north western zone that (41:06 - 41:12)

pokemon that aren't on the surface (45:38 - 45:41)
necessarily or (45:40 - 45:43)
are they're easier to see (45:41 - 45:46)
uh it i like the underground because it (45:43 - 45:49)
does feel a bit like the wild area and i (45:46 - 45:50)
can see things (45:49 - 45:52)
and i can choose if i'm going to run (45:50 - 45:54)
into them although (45:52 - 45:55)
sometimes they choose for you because (45:54 - 45:57)
they'll just turn and (45:55 - 46:00)
come in running at you yeah right (45:57 - 46:01)
because they're gonna wreck your house (46:00 - 46:03)
they do say the hideaways are home to (46:01 - 46:06)

and then finally (51:08 - 51:12)
you can explore the grand underground (51:11 - 51:15)
with seven other players (51:12 - 51:17)

use your nintendo switch local or you're (51:19 - 51:23)
connected to the internet (51:21 - 51:24)
if you want to play in a private session (51:23 - 51:26)
you can uh set up and share an (51:24 - 51:28)
eight-digit link code (51:26 - 51:30)
once you're in a multi-player together (51:28 - 51:31)
your friends can help you dig each (51:30 - 51:33)
other's treasure treasures lend a hand (51:31 - 51:35)
to approach somebody who's currently (51:33 - 51:36)
digging (51:35 - 51:37)

twinkling spot to the wall to help that (51:37 - 51:40)
player (51:39 - 51:43)
when you're helping somebody else dig (51:40 - 51:45)
you can advance their wall without (51:43 - 51:46)
cracking the top of their screen (51:45 - 51:49)
increasing the chance of safely (51:46 - 51:52)
digging up the treasure (51:49 - 51:53)
you will also have a higher chance of (51:52 - 51:55)
digging up rare items during a (51:53 - 51:57)
multiplayer session (51:55 - 51:58)
which i don't think i've heard from (51:57 - 52:00)
anyone before (51:58 - 52:02)
you can also collect glossy stones while (52:00 - 52:05)
exploring the grand underground with (52:02 - 52:06)
other players if you see a diglett or (52:05 - 52:08)
duke trio in the tunnel approach it to (52:06 - 52:11)
find a glossy stone on the ground (52:08 - 52:13)
if you collect enough glossy stones (52:11 - 52:15)
you'll trigger a period period of bonus (52:13 - 52:16)
time (52:15 - 52:18)
not only does bonus not only does the (52:16 - 52:20)
bonus boost your odds of finding rare (52:18 - 52:23)
items from fossil digging it also raises (52:20 - 52:26)
the appearance rate of (52:23 - 52:28)
rare or shiny pokemon inside of (52:26 - 52:31)
hideaways (52:28 - 52:31)
so this is our first official article (52:31 - 52:34)
where they have been (52:33 - 52:37)
mentioned (52:34 - 52:37)
the increase of shiny pokemon (52:37 - 52:44)
and from what i understand it doesn't (52:41 - 52:46)
they aren't shiny in the overworld you (52:44 - 52:48)
do have to run into them right yes (52:46 - 52:51)
correct okay (52:48 - 52:51)
it sounds like it is a plus one to your (52:51 - 52:57)
role according to data miners so (52:54 - 52:59)
as all i've said this multiple times (52:57 - 53:01)
this week (52:59 - 53:02)
say it again (53:01 - 53:04)
for the podcast listeners (53:02 - 53:06)
there has not been a single instance in (53:04 - 53:09)
the last 10 years of the data miners (53:06 - 53:11)
being right the very first week the game (53:09 - 53:13)
came out hey yeah (53:11 - 53:16)
uh case in point with sword and shield (53:13 - 53:18)
it was two full years before we figured (53:16 - 53:20)
out how brilliant pokemon actually (53:18 - 53:21)
worked (53:20 - 53:24)
let's go was like two weeks (53:21 - 53:26)
ultrasound ultramoon was like a month (53:24 - 53:28)
it was like almost a year for dexnav (53:26 - 53:30)
because for whatever reason people (53:28 - 53:33)
didn't believe dexnav and auras (53:30 - 53:35)
so even though they said that they said (53:33 - 53:37)
what they said this week and they're (53:35 - 53:39)
saying that instead of one in four (53:37 - 53:41)
thousand during your bonus time in the (53:39 - 53:44)
underground it is two in four thousand (53:41 - 53:46)
which isn't that great (53:44 - 53:48)
this bonus time only lasts five minutes (53:46 - 53:50)
when you're playing with friends (53:48 - 53:52)
i would still (53:50 - 53:55)
be cautiously optimistic (53:52 - 53:57)
or just be open to that number probably (53:55 - 53:58)
changing (53:57 - 54:00)
if more information is found but maybe (53:58 - 54:02)
not maybe this is the game they were (54:00 - 54:04)
right the first time (54:02 - 54:07)
completely possible possible (54:04 - 54:11)
their track record has said differently (54:07 - 54:12)
but who knows (54:11 - 54:13)
um (54:12 - 54:14)
you would think with pokemon a game (54:13 - 54:16)
after pokemon game they would have (54:14 - 54:18)
gotten better at this and boy sword and (54:16 - 54:20)
shield was a hot mess of getting that (54:18 - 54:24)
information wrong (54:20 - 54:24)
um (54:26 - 54:29)
yeah i think the underground is a good (54:27 - 54:31)
substitute to the wild area that isn't (54:29 - 54:34)
just the wild area (54:31 - 54:34)
i think my biggest problem with the (54:35 - 54:40)
underground is (54:36 - 54:40)
the movement (54:41 - 54:44)
like walking through one of these (54:43 - 54:47)
caverns or caves and just feeling like (54:44 - 54:50)
i'm getting stuck on everything (54:47 - 54:52)
are using d-pad or (54:50 - 54:53)
no (54:52 - 54:57)
i only play with the d-pad what yeah (54:53 - 54:59)
it's a grid-based game (54:57 - 55:01)
d-pad works (54:59 - 55:03)
d-pad hold down b run (55:01 - 55:05)
easy enough (55:03 - 55:07)
well we didn't get your what what is (55:05 - 55:09)
your i don't know how much of sincerely (55:07 - 55:11)
cinnamon you listen to (55:09 - 55:12)
very none (55:11 - 55:13)
very none okay (55:12 - 55:15)
greg and i did complain about the (55:13 - 55:16)
movement in this game (55:15 - 55:18)
but and specifically the d-pad feeling (55:16 - 55:22)
sluggish but you're only d-pad eh i yeah (55:18 - 55:25)
no d-pad b is makes you run yeah yeah i (55:22 - 55:26)
know it is right (55:25 - 55:29)

look canadian um (55:30 - 55:33)
yeah i (55:32 - 55:34)
i i've (55:33 - 55:37)
had zero problems using the d-pad i (55:34 - 55:39)
just gets me where i need to be (55:37 - 55:41)
and stops me from accidentally walking (55:39 - 55:43)
through doors that i did not intend on (55:41 - 55:45)
walking through (55:43 - 55:46)
which is a problem i was having with the (55:45 - 55:47)
joy (55:46 - 55:49)
joystick (55:47 - 55:51)
how are you feeling overall about (55:49 - 55:54)
diamond pro where are you at right now i (55:51 - 55:58)
got to heart home i did a super contest (55:54 - 56:01)
and now i've gone (55:58 - 56:03)
out of heart home on my voyage ever (56:01 - 56:06)
eastward because fantina didn't show up (56:03 - 56:07)
for work that day (56:06 - 56:11)
so yeah surprise (56:07 - 56:13)
it's like you were just there you were (56:11 - 56:15)
just there in front of the contest hall (56:13 - 56:18)
give me my battle gotta start raptor and (56:15 - 56:21)
was like by e (56:18 - 56:21)
uh (56:21 - 56:24)
overall i'm in love i i these i love (56:22 - 56:29)
this game i'm i'm so happy with it (56:24 - 56:29)
yes i'm thrilled (56:29 - 56:34)
craig's trying to process this (56:32 - 56:35)
no i i mean i don't know what your (56:34 - 56:37)
predictions were i don't have (56:35 - 56:41)
predictions my my overall is if (56:37 - 56:43)
if i had asked for a translation of a (56:41 - 56:45)
classic pokemon experience onto the (56:43 - 56:48)
switch that is what i got (56:45 - 56:50)
and that makes me very happy did you (56:48 - 56:52)
like auras i couldn't remember (56:50 - 56:53)
i played the heck out of auras (56:52 - 56:56)
absolutely (56:53 - 56:56)
i did a ton of competitive and and i i (56:57 - 57:01)
would say probably the competitive (56:59 - 57:03)
breeding mechanic in aurora's was the (57:01 - 57:06)
best of anything we ever had (57:03 - 57:08)
so yes yes (57:06 - 57:10)
i did a ton of so frustrated currently (57:08 - 57:12)
in my current (57:10 - 57:15)
attempts (57:12 - 57:15)
i i will say it's kind of funny to me (57:19 - 57:22)
because (57:21 - 57:25)
the first time i had platinum (57:22 - 57:27)
and i got to (57:25 - 57:29)
oarberg city and it took me so long and (57:27 - 57:31)
i was like i actually gave up the first (57:29 - 57:34)
time the second time i played platinum i (57:31 - 57:36)
was only trying to complete my living (57:34 - 57:38)
decks so i rushed through it and didn't (57:36 - 57:39)
really pay attention to what was going (57:38 - 57:42)
on so this time i'm actually paying (57:39 - 57:44)
attention to the story (57:42 - 57:46)
and i really like it (57:44 - 57:48)
the story is pretty good i'm having so (57:46 - 57:51)
much it's oh it's like the routes have (57:48 - 57:53)
people on them and distance and you (57:51 - 57:56)
actually are on an adventure traveling (57:53 - 57:58)
to places i love it (57:56 - 57:59)
absolutely what i want you to have (57:58 - 58:02)
people on them yes i love it i love it (57:59 - 58:05)
love it love it and i finally (58:02 - 58:06)
remember (58:05 - 58:07)
cheryl (58:06 - 58:09)
and they had that whole cartoon with (58:07 - 58:10)
cheryl and everybody was like who's (58:09 - 58:12)
cheryl and it's like oh no ah this is (58:10 - 58:14)
cheryl (58:12 - 58:15)
the (58:14 - 58:18)
popular pokemon master cheryl yeah is (58:15 - 58:20)
she in there oh yeah oh she's she's in (58:18 - 58:24)
there all right she's very helpful (58:20 - 58:26)
not in masters unless you're trying to (58:24 - 58:28)
catch a pokemon and she kills it before (58:26 - 58:30)
you get a chance to catch it (58:28 - 58:32)
uh last bit of news here is off nintendo (58:30 - 58:34)
life pokemon brilliant diamond and (58:32 - 58:36)
shining pearl has three mystery codes (58:34 - 58:38)
not really off nintendo life but they (58:36 - 58:40)
look they put in a chart it was easy um (58:38 - 58:42)
so there's the tertwig chimchar piplup (58:40 - 58:45)
statues that will end on may 31st so you (58:42 - 58:47)
have plenty of time (58:45 - 58:51)
uh that code is bdsp underground um i (58:47 - 58:52)
posted that on instagram and twitter as (58:51 - 58:53)
well (58:52 - 58:54)
so if you forget this after the (58:53 - 58:56)
recording just go to my instagram or (58:54 - 58:58)
twitter and you'll see it (58:56 - 59:00)
um there's also the manafee egg you do (58:58 - 59:03)
not need a code you go to choose get via (59:00 - 59:05)
internet (59:03 - 59:07)
and then there's the platinum style (59:05 - 59:09)
clothing which again you go to choose (59:07 - 59:12)
get via internet both of those end on (59:09 - 59:14)
february 21st (59:12 - 59:15)
so (59:14 - 59:18)
you want that mana fee (59:15 - 59:20)
you got like three months to get it (59:18 - 59:23)
and you want the three statues which (59:20 - 59:24)
probably aren't that big of a deal you (59:23 - 59:26)
got till may so (59:24 - 59:28)
you got plenty of time i guess if you (59:26 - 59:31)
want fiona too you need to (59:28 - 59:33)
get the mana fee (59:31 - 59:34)
yeah fiona is easy to get though because (59:33 - 59:36)
fiona can make fiona as well (59:34 - 59:38)
correct (59:36 - 59:40)
oh i should do that i forgot all about (59:38 - 59:43)
that the gotta i gotta have a mana fee (59:40 - 59:45)
yeah the statue stuff is cool because it (59:43 - 59:46)
makes it seem like they can give more (59:45 - 59:48)
statues or maybe even other stuff in the (59:46 - 59:49)
future (59:48 - 59:50)
so (59:49 - 59:54)
uh what i'm curious about though is (59:50 - 59:54)
well i don't know this game is (59:55 - 59:59)
incredibly broken that's for sure (59:56 - 60:02)
uh but i wonder if the underground will (59:59 - 60:03)
have some sort of like (60:02 - 60:06)
events that the wild area has like this (60:03 - 60:07)
weekend (60:06 - 60:09)
um (60:07 - 60:12)
there'll be more licket tongues in the (60:09 - 60:13)
caverns (60:12 - 60:15)
versus (60:13 - 60:17)
you know the well mostly it's mostly (60:15 - 60:21)
geodudes and gravelers i feel like but (60:17 - 60:22)
it's always geodude weekend and diamond (60:21 - 60:25)
and pearl (60:22 - 60:25)
i mean i imagine that since statues can (60:26 - 60:31)
control it (60:29 - 60:34)
they have ways of of bumping (60:31 - 60:35)
appearances (60:34 - 60:37)
yeah in their own game so i wouldn't be (60:35 - 60:40)
surprised if they do (60:37 - 60:42)
underground (60:40 - 60:43)
event weekends i just don't know what (60:42 - 60:44)
they would do (60:43 - 60:47)
like i don't know (60:44 - 60:49)
because i don't know a weekend where (60:47 - 60:52)
more digletts are spawning (60:49 - 60:53)
because i actually feel like the (60:52 - 60:55)
digletts are (60:53 - 60:57)
like i don't know how they decide how (60:55 - 60:58)
they do max raid battle weekend so i (60:57 - 61:00)
have no clue what they're gonna do for (60:58 - 61:01)
underground (61:00 - 61:03)
weekends like it's national whale (61:01 - 61:06)
weekend greg let's increase the whale (61:03 - 61:08)
lords the only question i would have on (61:06 - 61:10)
that is that works in sword and shield (61:08 - 61:12)
because they have that section where (61:10 - 61:14)
it's like update the wild area weather (61:12 - 61:16)
report and that's what kind of updates (61:14 - 61:17)
your (61:16 - 61:19)
max raids and everything if there's (61:17 - 61:21)
nothing like that for diamond and pearl (61:19 - 61:23)
that you would go to as part of the menu (61:21 - 61:24)
then you're not going to be downloading (61:23 - 61:25)
updated (61:24 - 61:27)
it does ask you every time before you go (61:25 - 61:30)
in though like how you want to connect (61:27 - 61:31)
true (61:30 - 61:32)
yeah so if you're if you're saying i (61:31 - 61:35)
want to connect via local or online and (61:32 - 61:37)
then when you say online you say random (61:35 - 61:40)
link code or (61:37 - 61:42)
it's the third one like (61:40 - 61:45)
it's with a link code open with internet (61:42 - 61:47)
something else i think it's with a group (61:45 - 61:49)
with a group which the group thing is (61:47 - 61:50)
really weird because you can only add (61:49 - 61:55)
people to your group locally (61:50 - 61:55)
so like you can go to you can talk to (61:57 - 62:00)
the guy in juba life and he'll be like (61:58 - 62:02)
hey do you want to make a squad or a (62:00 - 62:04)
group or a client (62:02 - 62:05)
yeah yeah (62:04 - 62:07)
and then you'll be like yeah (62:05 - 62:09)
and then he'll specifically say you can (62:07 - 62:12)
only add these people locally (62:09 - 62:14)
but when you go online and you say i (62:12 - 62:16)
don't want to do local i want to do (62:14 - 62:17)
online one of the options is to play (62:16 - 62:19)
with your group (62:17 - 62:22)
but you have needed to meet that (62:19 - 62:25)
person locally in order for that to work (62:22 - 62:27)
sounds like a safety measure (62:25 - 62:30)
yeah (62:27 - 62:30)
my parents aren't going to let me meet (62:30 - 62:34)
up with strangers (62:32 - 62:35)
but there's not even uh there's not even (62:34 - 62:37)
a list of people you're playing with in (62:35 - 62:39)
the underground (62:37 - 62:41)
i mean their name comes and goes (62:39 - 62:43)
yeah (62:41 - 62:43)
but like if they come in and it's been (62:43 - 62:47)
an hour and you miss them leaving and (62:45 - 62:48)
you look and you're like well there's (62:47 - 62:50)
seven other people here like i don't (62:48 - 62:51)
actually know who these seven other (62:50 - 62:54)
people are (62:51 - 62:55)
i don't know if there's a timeout (62:54 - 62:56)
feature either i don't know if somebody (62:55 - 62:58)
comes into the underground and they just (62:56 - 63:00)
sit there forever (62:58 - 63:02)
there's gotta be a timeout feature do (63:00 - 63:04)
they get kicked because you can't kick (63:02 - 63:06)
them you can't see who's on the list (63:04 - 63:07)
yeah your switch is going to fall asleep (63:06 - 63:09)
is what's going to happen (63:07 - 63:13)
then you're going to get kicked yeah (63:09 - 63:13)
um all right well let's let's wrap up (63:14 - 63:18)
here we don't need a terribly long show (63:16 - 63:20)
this week we just put out nine podcasts (63:18 - 63:21)
in a row so (63:20 - 63:23)
um (63:21 - 63:26)
greg give us question of the week (63:23 - 63:29)
query me a little what's the question of (63:26 - 63:31)
the week (63:29 - 63:33)
stuart was the one that sent in the (63:31 - 63:36)
converse stuff tone sent in the lucario (63:33 - 63:37)
stuff (63:36 - 63:40)
so thank you for that (63:37 - 63:40)
are those both the irish dudes (63:42 - 63:48)
i believe so (63:45 - 63:48)
ireland representing this week (63:49 - 63:53)
before al complains northern ireland and (63:54 - 64:02)
regular ireland representing this week (63:58 - 64:04)
northern ireland and (64:02 - 64:06)
medium ireland (64:04 - 64:08)
with adjectives that (64:06 - 64:10)
what adjectives should be added to the (64:08 - 64:12)
names of the eventual black and white (64:10 - 64:13)
remakes like brilliant diamond shining (64:12 - 64:16)
pearl omega ruby and alpha sapphire (64:13 - 64:18)
pitch black (64:16 - 64:20)
stark white (64:18 - 64:22)
i i mean (64:20 - 64:24)
something like like darkest black (64:22 - 64:27)
brightest white probably (64:24 - 64:29)
something like that the darkest day the (64:27 - 64:32)
darkest day (64:29 - 64:32)
midnight black (64:34 - 64:38)
noon (64:37 - 64:40)
noon night noonday (64:38 - 64:42)
white yeah there you go (64:40 - 64:47)
midnight rainbow daylight prideful white (64:42 - 64:47)
that get it because they're like a bunch (64:48 - 64:52)
of colors and then i (64:50 - 64:53)
then black and white (64:52 - 64:55)
it's not always black (64:53 - 64:57)
it's not always it's not always black (64:55 - 65:01)
sometimes it's white the remakes (64:57 - 65:01)
um (65:04 - 65:08)
i don't want black and white remakes i (65:06 - 65:10)
want to get give me a third version just (65:08 - 65:12)
do it (65:10 - 65:14)
but if the remake is a third version i (65:12 - 65:17)
i'm curious given that there's black and (65:14 - 65:19)
white in black and white too (65:17 - 65:22)
why would they not do black and white (65:19 - 65:24)
and white three is because people would (65:22 - 65:26)
look at it and be like i didn't play one (65:24 - 65:28)
and two (65:26 - 65:28)
although you didn't need to play (65:29 - 65:31)
original black and white to play we say (65:30 - 65:34)
that and people jump into final fantasy (65:31 - 65:36)
eight eight million and don't care about (65:34 - 65:38)
the others that's true but even with (65:36 - 65:40)
final fantasy 15 a very common question (65:38 - 65:42)
was do i have to play the ones before it (65:40 - 65:44)
yeah and the easy answer was you type (65:42 - 65:46)
that to google and it says no (65:44 - 65:48)
and everybody who's played the game says (65:46 - 65:50)
no it's not like it's a hard thing they (65:48 - 65:53)
could put they could put a sticker on (65:50 - 65:54)
everything you do not need to play the (65:53 - 65:58)
other ones to understand this story (65:54 - 66:01)
it could just be black and white again (65:58 - 66:01)
super black super white or blackest (66:03 - 66:07)
white yeah or it could be (66:05 - 66:08)
like (66:07 - 66:12)
pokemon gray chronicles and then it's (66:08 - 66:15)
a third version that's both the (66:12 - 66:18)
first two to come can you do that though (66:15 - 66:20)
black and white three colors revenge (66:18 - 66:22)
there you go don't need to play the (66:20 - 66:24)
other games to understand anything (66:22 - 66:25)
that's happening in this game polaris (66:24 - 66:28)
black gets us white (66:25 - 66:29)
yeah (66:28 - 66:32)
i mean the chorus is of ambiguous evil (66:29 - 66:34)
we're not certain whether (66:32 - 66:36)
they're actually evil or not but yeah (66:34 - 66:38)
you can't just do like it would be hard (66:36 - 66:40)
to do a black and white chronicles (66:38 - 66:41)
because (66:40 - 66:43)
in the first one you start in the (66:41 - 66:46)
southeast of the region and the second (66:43 - 66:47)
one you start in the southwest of the (66:46 - 66:50)
region so in the (66:47 - 66:51)
the new version you started in the (66:50 - 66:54)
northwest part the edwards you started (66:51 - 66:58)
that terrible desert area (66:54 - 66:58)
that desert area was probably the worst (66:58 - 67:02)
part of that game (67:00 - 67:04)
which part which there were two desert (67:02 - 67:05)
areas (67:04 - 67:06)
that's the problem (67:05 - 67:08)
there was two (67:06 - 67:09)
no (67:08 - 67:11)
no what do you mean by two i mean you (67:09 - 67:13)
walk through the door to the to where (67:11 - 67:14)
the ruins were are you talking about the (67:13 - 67:15)
construction no there's like the (67:14 - 67:18)
construction area with like mandibles (67:15 - 67:20)
oh yeah yeah (67:18 - 67:21)
that's like that one's like pretty small (67:20 - 67:23)
though (67:21 - 67:23)
those are real good games though (67:24 - 67:26)
yeah (67:26 - 67:29)
correct (67:26 - 67:29)
uh james says if you could try a food or (67:32 - 67:36)
drink from the pokemon universe what (67:34 - 67:38)
would you pick rosary tea (67:36 - 67:40)
stelia cone (67:38 - 67:43)
what do you mean is that a thing yes (67:40 - 67:45)
it's it was it was in galler (67:43 - 67:49)
was it or was it in sun and moon (67:45 - 67:49)
i think it started in sun and moon it's (67:52 - 67:58)
appeared in other places since then yep (67:53 - 67:58)
i mean because sun and moon did have (67:59 - 68:04)
that big drinking focus (68:00 - 68:04)
but yeah for me castella cone definitely (68:06 - 68:10)
i love ice cream so that's easy (68:08 - 68:13)
yeah i also like ice cream a lot (68:10 - 68:16)

i was there when you saw will (69:25 - 69:30)
pokemon black promises kept pokemon (69:27 - 69:32)
white (69:30 - 69:35)
prominently uh (69:32 - 69:36)

board supposed to be good for bones (69:39 - 69:43)
um pokemon of the week (69:41 - 69:45)
all right (69:43 - 69:47)
i mean not last week's because you guys (69:45 - 69:48)
were (69:47 - 69:50)
doing your whole (69:48 - 69:53)
shout out thing i was hunting chat ah (69:50 - 69:57)
so what was uh is about flying types we (69:53 - 69:59)
had an error because we said ternatus is (69:57 - 70:01)
the only mono flying type but it's not (69:59 - 70:03)
because the two (70:01 - 70:05)
uh there's some birds that were (70:03 - 70:07)
introduced that are also mono flying (70:05 - 70:09)
type (70:07 - 70:11)
but of the flying types there's only two (70:09 - 70:14)
evolution lines and one pokemon with two (70:11 - 70:15)
alternate forms that have flying as (70:14 - 70:18)
their primary type (70:15 - 70:19)
and either dragon steel or water as (70:18 - 70:21)
their secondary type (70:19 - 70:24)
and only of these only one maintains the (70:21 - 70:26)
same first and second type before and (70:24 - 70:29)
after evolving and if you wish to guess (70:26 - 70:30)
this week's pokemon of the week you must (70:29 - 70:32)
identify the very first dual type (70:30 - 70:35)
pokemon to have flying as its primary (70:32 - 70:37)
type (70:35 - 70:40)
and it's not kramer ant (70:37 - 70:40)
it's (70:40 - 70:43)
i wrote down noibat it was a long time (70:44 - 70:48)
ago it is my bat you are (70:46 - 70:50)
correct (70:48 - 70:53)
uh before in in under the wire shuffle (70:50 - 70:55)
icon is incredible (70:53 - 70:57)
and so is the shiny (70:55 - 71:02)
yeah so the um it's it's the noibat (70:57 - 71:04)
noyvern line uh (71:02 - 71:05)
corvinite (71:04 - 71:07)
and cameron (71:05 - 71:08)
are the three that have flying as (71:07 - 71:10)
primary (71:08 - 71:12)
i didn't know that about kramer (71:10 - 71:14)
oh who's a cramer ant fan now (71:12 - 71:16)
noibat good shiny (71:14 - 71:18)
great shiny (71:16 - 71:22)
noibat's german name (71:18 - 71:22)
eef m (71:22 - 71:27)
is the only perfect use fm fm oh you (71:23 - 71:29)
don't say the ease no is the only (71:27 - 71:31)
pokemon name that uses the latin (71:29 - 71:32)
alphabet (71:31 - 71:35)
and does not start with a capital letter (71:32 - 71:38)
originally noibat's pokedex entry of on (71:35 - 71:40)
the official website was incorrect (71:38 - 71:43)
showing that it was pure flying type it (71:40 - 71:45)
is it has since been fixed (71:43 - 71:48)
nobody can seem to be seen parallel to (71:45 - 71:50)
zubat both are flying type pokemon both (71:48 - 71:53)
have infiltrator as an ability they also (71:50 - 71:55)
share the same base stats and (71:53 - 71:57)
uh with their attack and special attack (71:55 - 71:59)
switched around (71:57 - 72:01)
maybe that's gen 6 though right (71:59 - 72:04)
yes yeah (72:01 - 72:04)
everybody every generation has got to (72:05 - 72:09)
have its bat (72:07 - 72:11)
there has to be an electric mouse and (72:09 - 72:13)
there it has to be a bat most of them (72:11 - 72:17)
have zubat as their bat (72:13 - 72:17)
every generation (72:17 - 72:24)
needs a geodude specifically gen 4. (72:18 - 72:26)
look i can't complain i love my geodude (72:24 - 72:28)
well he's not a geodude anymore is he a (72:26 - 72:30)
golem (72:28 - 72:32)
