actually relevant (0:42 - 0:46)
unlike the 25th anniversary of pokemon (0:43 - 0:50)
no relevance no relevance (0:46 - 0:53)

you new (0:53 - 0:57)
midwestern cuisine i sampled this (0:54 - 0:58)

the uh at the hyvee (1:13 - 1:17)
um so for the uninitiated the crispy (1:15 - 1:20)
puff is very similar to (1:17 - 1:23)
what we in new york used to call uh (1:20 - 1:24)
funnel cake (1:23 - 1:25)
um other places i've seen it like an (1:24 - 1:27)
elephant ear i think (1:25 - 1:30)
excited no no no no no no no crispy puff (1:27 - 1:33)
crispy okay it is the the big difference (1:30 - 1:35)
is it's not fresh (1:33 - 1:39)
nah never fresh never fresh (1:35 - 1:42)
and it is covered in that very (1:39 - 1:46)
like thick like coarse (1:42 - 1:49)
granule sugar um and then this one has (1:46 - 1:50)
cinnamon (1:49 - 1:52)

crunchy (1:52 - 1:55)

i have to actually set up an actual (4:21 - 4:26)
i'm just saying my room is now in (4:24 - 4:28)

swablu community (6:38 - 6:42)
exclusive research called cotton winged (6:39 - 6:44)

collect mega altaria energy to evolve (7:03 - 7:09)
any of the altaria you've collected (7:06 - 7:09)
during (7:09 - 7:13)
the event and then a 1 4 (7:09 - 7:15)
hatch egg distance will be available (7:13 - 7:17)
which is kind of a bummer (7:15 - 7:19)
uh because i'm pretty sure it still (7:17 - 7:20)
costs 400 (7:19 - 7:23)
candy to evolve saw blue yeah (7:20 - 7:26)
so i think it should have been double (7:23 - 7:27)
candy (7:26 - 7:30)
incense will last for three hours and we (7:27 - 7:30)
are still (7:30 - 7:34)
in the pandemic version of community (7:30 - 7:36)
which i guess we're technically still in (7:34 - 7:39)
a pandemic but it is (7:36 - 7:41)
why just turn on the make why why can't (7:39 - 7:42)
we have three hours (7:41 - 7:44)
why are they 30 minutes just turn on the (7:42 - 7:45)
three hours (7:44 - 7:50)
i have a question what if (7:45 - 7:54)
altaria is real but we just can't see (7:50 - 7:56)
them because they just look like clouds (7:54 - 7:58)
in blue sky (7:56 - 8:00)
so they're camouflaged i mean that's how (7:58 - 8:03)
they survived all these years (8:00 - 8:05)
who's hunting the altarias i like (8:03 - 8:08)
altaria (8:05 - 8:08)
apparently steve that's why i think i'll (8:08 - 8:11)
tear (8:11 - 8:14)
hunted to extinction that's a gen 3 (8:11 - 8:15)
pokemon greg (8:14 - 8:19)
yeah i like that a fan i'm a fan of (8:15 - 8:21)
altaria i'm saying (8:19 - 8:23)
that they are camouflaged because (8:21 - 8:25)
they've been over hunted (8:23 - 8:27)
they got a good shiny too they do have a (8:25 - 8:29)
good shiny (8:27 - 8:31)
maybe the shinies wait hold on what (8:29 - 8:32)
color is that shiny (8:31 - 8:35)
it's gold yeah they're getting picked (8:32 - 8:35)
off (8:35 - 8:38)
yeah the golden ones are like they're (8:35 - 8:39)
floating around in the sky like wait (8:38 - 8:40)
there's a gold (8:39 - 8:42)
thing now i'm going to figure out if i (8:40 - 8:45)
can do community day on saturday (8:42 - 8:47)
why where are you going on saturday oh (8:45 - 8:48)
couch being delivered (8:47 - 8:50)

die taking this couch down that hill i'm (9:29 - 9:33)
going to hire professionals (9:32 - 9:36)
potentially as was suggested to be by my (9:33 - 9:37)
mother-in-law (9:36 - 9:40)
we should use the junk calling company (9:37 - 9:44)
and i quote college hunks (9:40 - 9:46)
to come get our junk uh hello this is (9:44 - 9:47)

desiccated decimated destroyed couch (10:10 - 10:16)
like we're getting a new couch (10:14 - 10:18)
for a reason the old couch has (10:16 - 10:20)
completely fallen apart you messed up (10:18 - 10:21)
you should have bought the couch (10:20 - 10:26)
like a week before school started (10:21 - 10:27)
and then the college people are (10:26 - 10:29)
desperate for anything (10:27 - 10:33)
i'm not waiting until september to get a (10:29 - 10:34)
new couch (10:33 - 10:36)
it's been a year and a half it's just a (10:34 - 10:38)
garage (10:36 - 10:40)
you need me to be in minnesota there's a (10:38 - 10:41)
lot of things you're asking for right (10:40 - 10:42)
now i'm asking for (10:41 - 10:45)
my roof to be replaced which it is i (10:42 - 10:46)
need to get my (10:45 - 10:50)
entire garage fixed i need a new couch (10:46 - 10:52)
i need a new office which i've done i've (10:50 - 10:54)
set up my office for work look (10:52 - 10:56)
my life is complicated i have a lot of (10:54 - 10:57)
things going on unlike you (10:56 - 11:01)
mr streamer who has one thing going on (10:57 - 11:04)
sitting where you are 24 7 trying to get (11:01 - 11:07)
people to look at you (11:04 - 11:07)
what a way to put it there's not a lot (11:07 - 11:11)
of lies in that sentence (11:10 - 11:13)
[Laughter] (11:11 - 11:17)
there's no lies but suave luke me today (11:13 - 11:18)
this saturday (11:17 - 11:21)
yes uh i would say the temperature (11:18 - 11:21)
reading (11:21 - 11:23)
on this announcement was a little (11:21 - 11:24)
lukewarm (11:23 - 11:28)
tepid i i was almost of the opinion that (11:24 - 11:30)
we've already had a sua blue community (11:28 - 11:33)
today no we have not i think what you're (11:30 - 11:35)
thinking of is when we went to the go (11:33 - 11:36)
fest (11:35 - 11:39)
um two years ago swablu was one of the (11:36 - 11:40)
boosted pokemon (11:39 - 11:42)
i actually think that i'm just confusing (11:40 - 11:44)
swablu and dratini (11:42 - 11:46)
it was this one yeah yeah yeah but those (11:44 - 11:48)
the go fest where they had like the (11:46 - 11:49)
spooky area (11:48 - 11:51)
and then they had the muddy area and it (11:49 - 11:53)
was actually muddy not because they (11:51 - 11:55)
designed it to be muddy but because it (11:53 - 11:55)
rained (11:55 - 12:00)
yes um we had to have clear backpacks (11:55 - 12:02)
that was the third go fest because it (12:00 - 12:04)
was back at (12:02 - 12:07)
millennial park grant park (12:04 - 12:08)
because the first one was the failure (12:07 - 12:10)
second one was lincoln park (12:08 - 12:14)
yes third one was yeah (12:10 - 12:14)
so the the exciting news i guess and we (12:16 - 12:22)
need to talk about this because (12:19 - 12:25)
it's dumb is that they (12:22 - 12:28)
announced that the june community (12:25 - 12:32)
will be gibbel yes which is a pokemon (12:28 - 12:35)
that has that people have been asking (12:32 - 12:36)
for for community for a very very long (12:35 - 12:38)
time it's a pretty rare pokemon (12:36 - 12:42)
in the scheme of things (12:38 - 12:42)
so they didn't give any details about (12:42 - 12:46)
that they just announced that june i (12:44 - 12:48)
think it's june 6 we'll be gibbel (12:46 - 12:51)
uh for the most part it seemed that (12:48 - 12:52)
people were very positive on it but some (12:51 - 12:54)
were pretty negative (12:52 - 12:55)
so i just kind of want to talk about (12:54 - 12:57)
that (12:55 - 12:57)
baseball and the pokemon community were (12:57 - 13:00)
negative about a community today (12:59 - 13:03)
yeah so it seems that there's like this (13:00 - 13:05)
lose-lose situation that niantic is (13:03 - 13:07)
doing at this point (13:05 - 13:10)
because they took a pokemon that has uh (13:07 - 13:11)
been (13:10 - 13:12)
they took a pokemon that's pretty hard (13:11 - 13:15)
to evolve uh that's been shiny for a (13:12 - 13:16)
pretty long time (13:15 - 13:18)
you know overall not that exciting of a (13:16 - 13:19)
pokemon (13:18 - 13:22)
swablu is not a starter or blue yeah i (13:19 - 13:23)
like bluetooth but it's (13:22 - 13:24)
you know it's not a charmander it's not (13:23 - 13:26)
a squirtle and (13:24 - 13:30)
no that's it and then you take a pokemon (13:26 - 13:30)
that (13:30 - 13:33)
you know people j like people love (13:30 - 13:35)
garchomp uh people love the (13:33 - 13:36)
you know cynthia's associated with (13:35 - 13:38)
garchomp uh it's a (13:36 - 13:41)
incredibly rare shiny uh niantic (13:38 - 13:44)
whether they did it purposely or not (13:41 - 13:45)
made probably a lot of money off gibbel (13:44 - 13:49)
raid's last go fest because (13:45 - 13:51)
uh myself and a bunch of other people (13:49 - 13:53)
were joining one dollar giveaway raids (13:51 - 13:54)
to try to get a shining gimbal (13:53 - 13:56)
so like there there's definitely value (13:54 - 13:58)
in gimbal (13:56 - 14:02)
for sure uh and there then there's this (13:58 - 14:04)
there's this like weird mindset that i (14:02 - 14:06)
feel like we talk about once every three (14:04 - 14:08)
months where people (14:06 - 14:11)
feel like once a pokemon is more (14:08 - 14:12)
accessible (14:11 - 14:15)
their quote-unquote work that they've (14:12 - 14:16)
done to (14:15 - 14:20)
get that pokemon is devalued in some way (14:16 - 14:22)
um and this this is not exclusive to (14:20 - 14:23)
pokemon games uh i saw this a lot in (14:22 - 14:25)
destiny and i think (14:23 - 14:26)
will knows where i'm going with this (14:25 - 14:29)
there was a weapon in destiny called (14:26 - 14:32)
gallerhorn uh horn it was a (14:29 - 14:35)
very it was it was the best weapon (14:32 - 14:37)
in destiny for a while and there was no (14:35 - 14:39)
way to don't join this raid unless (14:37 - 14:41)
you've got gal horn (14:39 - 14:44)
no non galahorn's not welcome when (14:41 - 14:47)
when destiny first launched the second (14:44 - 14:48)
week of destiny (14:47 - 14:52)
they had a uh a seller cell gala horn (14:48 - 14:54)
and this was before a meadow was (14:52 - 14:55)
established in destiny (14:54 - 14:58)
and no one bought gallihorn because why (14:55 - 14:58)
would you (14:58 - 15:01)
buy a rocket launcher when you could get (14:58 - 15:02)
there was other weapons (15:01 - 15:03)
and why would you waste because you (15:02 - 15:05)
could only have one rare weapon equipped (15:03 - 15:07)
they were called exotics (15:05 - 15:08)
so no one wanted to waste their exotic (15:07 - 15:10)
slot on a rocket launcher (15:08 - 15:13)
and then ever since the raid came out (15:10 - 15:14)
people figured out oh (15:13 - 15:17)
this is the best weapon and there was (15:14 - 15:19)
nothing you could do (15:17 - 15:22)
to get gallahorn besides play (15:19 - 15:25)
as much as possible and hope (15:22 - 15:27)
that you got an exotic drop which was (15:25 - 15:28)
already rare and then (15:27 - 15:31)
hope out of that exotic drop that it was (15:28 - 15:33)
out of like the 50 exotics they had that (15:31 - 15:35)
that one was gallahorn and not a weapon (15:33 - 15:36)
you already had (15:35 - 15:38)
and so i i definitely remember the day (15:36 - 15:40)
that i randomly got gallerhorn to drop (15:38 - 15:43)
and i played a lot of destiny (15:40 - 15:45)
um and it happened and then what (15:43 - 15:47)
happened in the community (15:45 - 15:50)
was when you went to try to join a raid (15:47 - 15:51)
people (15:50 - 15:55)
were like you need to have to join (15:51 - 15:59)
it was specifically crota's end yes (15:55 - 15:59)
so they were set they were they were (15:59 - 16:04)
setting a requirement that you needed to (16:01 - 16:06)
either have been lucky enough to get (16:04 - 16:08)
this gun to drop (16:06 - 16:11)
or you have played so much that you are (16:08 - 16:12)
again (16:11 - 16:14)
at the end of the day still lucky enough (16:12 - 16:15)
to have this weapon to drop (16:14 - 16:17)
and they didn't care about your skill (16:15 - 16:19)
level they were just like (16:17 - 16:22)
you need to have this gun because you (16:19 - 16:24)
didn't need skill to use gal horn (16:22 - 16:27)
you just point and click point and click (16:24 - 16:29)
some people still struggled with that (16:27 - 16:30)
part of the game (16:29 - 16:33)
there was a timing issue and then to (16:30 - 16:35)
make things worse greg (16:33 - 16:38)
there was like this there was you'll (16:35 - 16:39)
appreciate this (16:38 - 16:42)
there was a point where the seller came (16:39 - 16:44)
back it was like a year later (16:42 - 16:47)
and he came back to sell gallihorn (16:44 - 16:50)
and the community took a darker turn and (16:47 - 16:52)
they said (16:50 - 16:55)
if you bought the gala horn you're not (16:52 - 16:57)
allowed to join the raid you needed to (16:55 - 17:01)
earn your gala horn to be an raid (16:57 - 17:06)
people who bought it (17:01 - 17:06)
this is online community stuff where the (17:09 - 17:16)
the user is apply always you could also (17:13 - 17:18)
you could also when you're like filling (17:16 - 17:20)
out the form on reddit or (17:18 - 17:22)
uh the destiny like group website that (17:20 - 17:23)
people made you could just be like i (17:22 - 17:24)
have it and then when you get there you (17:23 - 17:25)
like (17:24 - 17:27)
don't bring it out right like it was (17:25 - 17:28)
really dumb (17:27 - 17:31)
i earned it with money so i think this (17:28 - 17:32)
is (17:31 - 17:33)
this is the problem so not a break it (17:32 - 17:36)
was it was (17:33 - 17:38)
it was silly and this comes to the (17:36 - 17:40)
problem of pokemon (17:38 - 17:42)
where i think uh the people that are (17:40 - 17:43)
like uh (17:42 - 17:45)
suave community today why do a better (17:43 - 17:47)
pokemon (17:45 - 17:48)
there are plenty of people that don't (17:47 - 17:50)
have shiny swabless there are plenty of (17:48 - 17:52)
people who have never evolved in altaria (17:50 - 17:54)
because they're not hardcore players and (17:52 - 17:56)
400 candy is a lot (17:54 - 17:58)
so you have these people being upset (17:56 - 18:02)
that now they're doing a community day (17:58 - 18:04)
for something to them (18:02 - 18:06)
feels like i already have this i don't (18:04 - 18:08)
want to do this why isn't it something (18:06 - 18:09)
new (18:08 - 18:13)
and then on the flip side you have (18:09 - 18:16)
gibbel and there are probably (18:13 - 18:18)
thousands of people with shiny gibble (18:16 - 18:20)
out there and they're upset (18:18 - 18:22)
because they feel like oh i spent all (18:20 - 18:25)
these money on raids or i played a lot (18:22 - 18:27)
more than you did and i have the shiny (18:25 - 18:30)
and now everyone is getting the shiny (18:27 - 18:31)
and there's this there's this (18:30 - 18:34)
conversation of like well my shiny is (18:31 - 18:37)
worthless now your daddy was always (18:34 - 18:39)
worthless but my question to these (18:37 - 18:41)
people is what was it worth (18:39 - 18:45)
yeah like like if if you had a (18:41 - 18:48)
98 shiny gimbal that you you know spent (18:45 - 18:50)
a week in grinding (18:48 - 18:51)
you wouldn't have traded it anyways (18:50 - 18:53)
because the ivs would have rerolled (18:51 - 18:56)
so like you wouldn't have tr if i have (18:53 - 18:58)
something in my house (18:56 - 19:02)
that i never plan on trading or selling (18:58 - 19:04)
there's no price on that because i don't (19:02 - 19:05)
plan like no (19:04 - 19:07)
no one can make me an offer to get rid (19:05 - 19:10)
of it like it just it's not worth (19:07 - 19:11)
anything because (19:10 - 19:13)
no matter what you give me i'm not going (19:11 - 19:15)
to give it to you (19:13 - 19:17)
i could find a price i just checked i (19:15 - 19:19)
already have a shiny uh swablu so i'll (19:17 - 19:22)
be taking saturday off thanks (19:19 - 19:24)
do you have two because you need two oh (19:22 - 19:26)
so you got me (19:24 - 19:29)
so it's like this venn diagram and i (19:26 - 19:31)
think there's overlap of people being (19:29 - 19:33)
like i already have the (19:31 - 19:35)
sua blue and i already have the gibbel (19:33 - 19:36)
and (19:35 - 19:38)
they're in like this like weird position (19:36 - 19:39)
of they (19:38 - 19:41)
they just come off being extremely (19:39 - 19:43)
selfish of like well i don't want swat (19:41 - 19:44)
blue because i have it (19:43 - 19:46)
and i don't want gibble because i don't (19:44 - 19:48)
want you to have it (19:46 - 19:51)
and i just want something brand new and (19:48 - 19:52)
it's it's such a (19:51 - 19:55)
weird wait let me add a third circle (19:52 - 19:58)
that's my level of aggravation because (19:55 - 20:00)
in the first like (19:58 - 20:03)
two years of this game every other (20:00 - 20:04)
community day (20:03 - 20:07)
was a starter yeah and (20:04 - 20:11)
then we had a long break where like (20:07 - 20:14)
2020 we we didn't do starters at all (20:11 - 20:16)
i don't think throughout any of 20 2021 (20:14 - 20:19)
finally april 2021 we're snivy (20:16 - 20:21)
i'm like i'm going to get my little (20:19 - 20:24)
tepig my cutie tepig (20:21 - 20:28)
that should be june it's not (20:24 - 20:31)
i mean typing in oshawa would probably (20:28 - 20:32)
eventually come (20:31 - 20:36)
i don't want eventually i want patterns (20:32 - 20:36)
patterns are important there there there (20:37 - 20:40)
is (20:39 - 20:41)
so the reason i think this is important (20:40 - 20:43)
to talk about is because (20:41 - 20:47)
like if if you are upset that (20:43 - 20:50)
gibbel is a community i (20:47 - 20:52)
don't know what video game you've been (20:50 - 20:53)
playing for the last (20:52 - 20:57)
five years but it is (20:53 - 21:00)
i i'm impressed that you are upset about (20:57 - 21:01)
this (21:00 - 21:04)
because like i (21:01 - 21:07)
am i'm shocked because (21:04 - 21:10)
if we look at if they did tratini right (21:07 - 21:11)
dirtini (21:10 - 21:15)
is the gibble of gen 1 they did (21:11 - 21:18)
um that hurts to say they did uh (21:15 - 21:21)
larvatar which i would probably say is (21:18 - 21:22)
the gibble of gen (21:21 - 21:25)
2. uh they did (21:22 - 21:29)
shell gun bagon and shogun (21:25 - 21:32)
they did uh beldum (21:29 - 21:35)
like these are all pseudo legendaries (21:32 - 21:38)
that they have all done so why (21:35 - 21:41)
would they not do gimbal (21:38 - 21:41)
spoiler spoiler spoiler they're going to (21:42 - 21:45)
do dino (21:44 - 21:48)
eventually yeah and they're going to do (21:45 - 21:48)
gooby (21:48 - 21:50)
eventually and they're going to do (21:48 - 21:52)
dreepy avenge like (21:50 - 21:55)
like it is impressive that that that (21:52 - 21:56)
that people couldn't (21:55 - 21:58)
think that that was event like they were (21:56 - 22:00)
going to suddenly skip gimbal community (21:58 - 22:01)
one like they were (22:00 - 22:03)
like like you really genuinely thought (22:01 - 22:04)
they weren't going to do it (22:03 - 22:07)
i am taking issue with the fact that (22:04 - 22:08)
you're calling it impressive (22:07 - 22:12)
that people can get upset over a very (22:08 - 22:13)
predictable thing that they're going to (22:12 - 22:14)
get upset over (22:13 - 22:18)
there is like the venn diagram of (22:14 - 22:21)
fandoms is the middle where everybody's (22:18 - 22:23)
always mad about something (22:21 - 22:26)
mad about something yes because (22:23 - 22:29)
there is some level of bizarro (22:26 - 22:30)
gatekeeping (22:29 - 22:33)
that they are involved in that's now (22:30 - 22:36)
having these other people in that's (22:33 - 22:37)
ruining their (22:36 - 22:40)
special feelings or hurting their (22:37 - 22:41)
feelings (22:40 - 22:44)
like you're if you're if (22:41 - 22:47)
if if all you have in life is a shining (22:44 - 22:48)
gift (22:47 - 22:50)
and other people getting shot at gimbal (22:48 - 22:52)
is like crushing your happiness (22:50 - 22:54)
i would maybe advise trying to find (22:52 - 22:56)
other things in life that make you happy (22:54 - 23:00)
yes i mean i'm still here collecting all (22:56 - 23:02)
the shiny rosalia from my friends (23:00 - 23:04)
again i've been i've been lacking i'm (23:02 - 23:06)
going into home and collecting there are (23:04 - 23:08)
people who have been sending to me (23:06 - 23:11)
but look (23:08 - 23:14)
chinese are worthless they don't (23:11 - 23:16)
they don't mean i i mean theoretically (23:14 - 23:18)
they're not worthless if you're (23:16 - 23:19)
if you're selling them to other people (23:18 - 23:21)
but who yeah (23:19 - 23:23)
but don't sell pokemon team rocket (23:21 - 23:24)
that's just rude (23:23 - 23:28)
yeah pokemon puzzle it's against cos (23:24 - 23:33)
uh set up by team rocket uh but (23:28 - 23:33)
every pokemon is going to have a shiny (23:33 - 23:39)
release because every pokemon has a (23:36 - 23:41)
shiny (23:39 - 23:41)
you should be doing this not for the (23:41 - 23:46)
pokemon but for your own internal (23:43 - 23:47)
experience and reward (23:46 - 23:51)
and life lesson others people's (23:47 - 23:52)
happiness (23:51 - 23:56)
does not ever need to infringe on yours (23:52 - 23:59)
you can be happy on your own thing when (23:56 - 24:01)
you got it when you did (23:59 - 24:03)
and i guarantee you when you showed a (24:01 - 24:04)
person two years ago (24:03 - 24:07)
hey i got a shiny gibble they probably (24:04 - 24:08)
said (24:07 - 24:11)
oh cool i want one too (24:08 - 24:13)
i wish i had one and after this (24:11 - 24:14)
community today there'll be people (24:13 - 24:16)
who'll be like hey look at my shiny (24:14 - 24:16)
kibble (24:16 - 24:19)
like oh cool i have one too look (24:16 - 24:21)
let's share i like this pokemon the (24:19 - 24:22)
conversation (24:21 - 24:25)
changed the slightest bit (24:22 - 24:29)
nobody ultimately cares about your 98 or (24:25 - 24:30)
100 (24:29 - 24:33)
shiny electronic code yes (24:30 - 24:37)
i i need a a psychologist a sociologist (24:33 - 24:39)
we have a wide range of listeners i'm (24:37 - 24:40)
sure there's someone in one of these (24:39 - 24:42)
fields i don't know which is the (24:40 - 24:43)
appropriate field (24:42 - 24:46)
to do an investigation of why in the (24:43 - 24:48)
21st century (24:46 - 24:52)
we have come to a place where (24:48 - 24:56)
other other people being happy (24:52 - 24:59)
takes away from me (24:56 - 25:02)
i think that's always been a thing we (24:59 - 25:04)
just have the internet to share it now (25:02 - 25:07)
it's not pervading more pervasive okay (25:04 - 25:11)
okay yeah i mean (25:07 - 25:11)
again it's just that pokemon go (25:12 - 25:20)
will always have an artificial rarity (25:16 - 25:21)
they will always introduce things that (25:20 - 25:23)
will be rare like right now (25:21 - 25:25)
it like when gibbel first came out (25:23 - 25:28)
gibbel was impossible to find (25:25 - 25:31)
and the that go fest last year made him (25:28 - 25:32)
a little bit more accessible (25:31 - 25:35)
um and then he went back to being rare (25:32 - 25:37)
and he's in like 10k eggs (25:35 - 25:40)
and you know if you're if you i it's (25:37 - 25:41)
also hard for me to (25:40 - 25:44)
feel bad for so the other argument maybe (25:41 - 25:45)
would be like (25:44 - 25:48)
well i spent this much money on (25:45 - 25:50)
incubators or i did this many raids to (25:48 - 25:51)
get a shiny gimbal and now they're just (25:50 - 25:53)
handing it out for free which i (25:51 - 25:55)
also disagree with the like handing it (25:53 - 25:57)
out for free having somebody (25:55 - 25:59)
give an hour of their time or two hours (25:57 - 26:01)
or six hours of their time is not free (25:59 - 26:04)
um they they have a set window to go and (26:01 - 26:04)
do (26:04 - 26:06)
something and time is the only real (26:04 - 26:07)
currency this is (26:06 - 26:12)
true yes but again (26:07 - 26:12)
if you're to the point where you're (26:12 - 26:15)
spending 50 60 (26:14 - 26:19)
70 on raid passes or incubators (26:15 - 26:22)
where have you been for five years this (26:19 - 26:24)
game has not changed (26:22 - 26:26)
when it first came out it was impossible (26:24 - 26:28)
to find a dratini (26:26 - 26:30)
dirtini was very hard to find do we (26:28 - 26:32)
remember when they made marip (26:30 - 26:34)
the rarest pokemon in the world it is a (26:32 - 26:37)
sheep that you found on route like (26:34 - 26:40)
207 or something and like they (26:37 - 26:42)
have artificially made pokemon rare and (26:40 - 26:43)
now (26:42 - 26:45)
when they did spawn marip like six (26:43 - 26:47)
months ago people were like oh look at (26:45 - 26:50)
all these marie blah blah blah (26:47 - 26:50)
like there will be a point where you (26:50 - 26:54)
will be sick of seeing dino (26:52 - 26:56)
well like right now dino is impossible (26:54 - 26:59)
to find in two years you'll be like i'm (26:56 - 27:02)
swimming in dino (26:59 - 27:04)
like it's just shocking that people are (27:02 - 27:06)
willing to spend so much money (27:04 - 27:10)
and then like bobby not (27:06 - 27:12)
pay attention to how like like it's not (27:10 - 27:14)
my niantic's not hiding what they're (27:12 - 27:15)
doing (27:14 - 27:17)
it's been very obvious what they're (27:15 - 27:19)
doing they pick (27:17 - 27:21)
why is a mogul rare no one cares about a (27:19 - 27:24)
moga they made him spawn for like (27:21 - 27:26)
a one in a hundred chance and then they (27:24 - 27:28)
took him away (27:26 - 27:30)
and he'll be back i'm sure oh i can't (27:28 - 27:32)
wait for a mocha community wait imoga (27:30 - 27:34)
doesn't evolve it can't be a community (27:32 - 27:35)
day (27:34 - 27:37)
dagger maybe they'll do a community day (27:35 - 27:38)
where it's all the pikachu knockouts (27:37 - 27:39)
they'll do (27:38 - 27:42)
a what generation did is (27:39 - 27:46)
is sinnoh is a molecule no uh how dare (27:42 - 27:48)
you (27:46 - 27:51)
they will have a unova ticket and it'll (27:48 - 27:52)
be shiny (27:51 - 27:55)
in the unova ticket now we're gonna get (27:52 - 27:56)
to november (27:55 - 27:59)
and it's gonna be pokemon's shocking (27:56 - 28:01)
25th anniversary and it's gonna be all (27:59 - 28:03)
the electric mice (28:01 - 28:04)
variants oh yeah it would be the (28:03 - 28:08)
electric mouse ticket all the knockoffs (28:04 - 28:10)
uh okay we did talk about this last week (28:08 - 28:11)
obviously (28:10 - 28:12)
the last bit of pokemon go news here (28:11 - 28:14)
which i think is part of the exciting so (28:12 - 28:16)
i thought the out of the three pokemon (28:14 - 28:17)
the gimbal was exciting (28:16 - 28:20)
well you had three this is the third one (28:17 - 28:21)
the bad one was the slaw blue (28:20 - 28:24)
this is bad no i don't think so either i (28:21 - 28:26)
mean none of these are good (28:24 - 28:28)
all right this is exciting though mark (28:26 - 28:30)
your calendars pokemon go fest returns (28:28 - 28:31)

worldwide format that saw trainers from (28:36 - 28:40)
around the globe working together to (28:38 - 28:41)
complete challenges unlock rewards (28:40 - 28:43)
defeat team rocket (28:41 - 28:44)
from the launch of the global challenge (28:43 - 28:47)
arena to the thrilling research that led (28:44 - 28:50)
us to victini pokemon go fest 2020 (28:47 - 28:52)

summer stay tuned for details (29:08 - 29:16)
um and then it just says the for more (29:12 - 29:18)
information about help and blah blah (29:16 - 29:20)
i remember not getting victini at the (29:18 - 29:21)
end of last year's go fest (29:20 - 29:26)
because you didn't log in that day yeah (29:21 - 29:28)
so we don't know price (29:26 - 29:30)
we know the dates july 17th and july (29:28 - 29:31)
18th (29:30 - 29:34)
probably 12.99 something around there (29:31 - 29:36)
yeah the first one was 1299 right (29:34 - 29:39)
yeah or was it 14.99 no i think it was (29:36 - 29:42)
12. i think it was 12. (29:39 - 29:42)
uh the mythical here is obviously (29:43 - 29:47)
mellowetta (29:45 - 29:49)
i know this is an audio podcast but uh (29:47 - 29:50)
when it says (29:49 - 29:53)
fest it is the green and the turquoise (29:50 - 29:54)
and then the like (29:53 - 29:56)
light the off-white and then there's (29:54 - 29:58)
little music notes it is literally (29:56 - 30:01)
melowetta's colors okay um (29:58 - 30:02)
plus the music notes kind of give it (30:01 - 30:05)
away yes (30:02 - 30:09)
uh so the mythical will be melowetta um (30:05 - 30:12)
i don't uh the don orange one the (30:09 - 30:13)
regular one (30:12 - 30:14)
i don't know what the regular mellow (30:13 - 30:16)
wedding form is called i think the (30:14 - 30:19)
orange one is called dance form though (30:16 - 30:21)
uh what's pirouette four and one (30:19 - 30:22)
something (30:21 - 30:24)
uh they show a scyther a merrell chess (30:22 - 30:25)
bin and a (30:24 - 30:27)
swoo bat in the picture and a pikachu i (30:25 - 30:29)
don't think there's any like (30:27 - 30:34)
hidden message here and pirouette for (30:29 - 30:37)
scythers s merrell's m p (30:34 - 30:41)
s m p c w (30:37 - 30:43)
s and p c w that's that's your hint no i (30:41 - 30:44)
don't know there's no (30:43 - 30:46)
i'm sure people have tried to figure out (30:44 - 30:48)
if picking scyther and meryl for this (30:46 - 30:50)
picture means anything i don't (30:48 - 30:54)
think so hogwater electric grass (30:50 - 30:57)
psychic oh wait pokemon has more than (30:54 - 30:59)
one type (30:57 - 31:02)
since when (30:59 - 31:02)
they didn't (31:02 - 31:08)
i i think it's probably safe to say (31:05 - 31:10)
or safe to speculate that it's going to (31:08 - 31:13)
be bare minimum exactly like last year (31:10 - 31:14)
in the sense (31:13 - 31:16)
where everyone buys a ticket and (31:14 - 31:17)
competes the question is (31:16 - 31:20)
are they going to have a physical (31:17 - 31:22)
location for some people (31:20 - 31:25)
and if they do opt to do that i don't (31:22 - 31:27)
what is the travel situation i don't (31:25 - 31:29)
think other countries can come (31:27 - 31:32)
here or because i know we like we as (31:29 - 31:34)
americans can't go to like japan (31:32 - 31:37)
so japan's not letting travis still off (31:34 - 31:38)
the books (31:37 - 31:41)
for pretty much everywhere uh you (31:38 - 31:44)
if uh so currently the cdc is saying if (31:41 - 31:44)
you are (31:44 - 31:48)
vaccinated you can travel domestically (31:44 - 31:51)
only so that means you could fly within (31:48 - 31:52)
the united states (31:51 - 31:54)
on a domestic flight as long as you're (31:52 - 31:56)
vaccinated (31:54 - 31:59)
the thing is is that most places still (31:56 - 32:00)
haven't (31:59 - 32:03)
opened a bunch of (32:00 - 32:06)
event spaces uh so you would have they (32:03 - 32:09)
would have to find a domestic location (32:06 - 32:11)
that is completely outdoors that has (32:09 - 32:13)
enough (32:11 - 32:16)
space space or not or just do what they (32:13 - 32:17)
did last year and just say it's global (32:16 - 32:19)
and i have a feeling they aren't going (32:17 - 32:21)
to try to do a central locale (32:19 - 32:25)
this close to things sort of being done (32:21 - 32:28)
so i will say the key here if you read (32:25 - 32:30)
the actual phrase on this very brief (32:28 - 32:33)
web page trainers from around the world (32:30 - 32:35)
are invited to participate in a special (32:33 - 32:39)
two-day pokemon go fest experience (32:35 - 32:42)
on july 17th and 18th if it was going to (32:39 - 32:42)
be (32:42 - 32:46)
at a location they would have said event (32:42 - 32:49)
so the one on pokemon go live (32:46 - 32:51)
it has different word words yeah what (32:49 - 32:52)
does it say there (32:51 - 32:55)
global event from july 7th wait no i'm (32:52 - 32:58)
looking at pokemongolive.com (32:55 - 33:02)
yeah mark first first line says event (32:58 - 33:05)
i that mine does not say event (33:02 - 33:08)
i would i would wait i would wager to (33:05 - 33:10)
bet they would want to try an event if (33:08 - 33:10)
they (33:10 - 33:13)
can um so (33:10 - 33:17)
and they would probably make it (33:13 - 33:19)
limited so i would say that that would (33:17 - 33:22)
have been possible (33:19 - 33:25)
if we had if things didn't look so dire (33:22 - 33:27)
six months ago because there's no way (33:25 - 33:30)
they could plan it within (33:27 - 33:32)
you know you know at the beginning of (33:30 - 33:34)
april for july and have that much (33:32 - 33:37)
time like that's a short window for (33:34 - 33:38)
things to have been released up (33:37 - 33:41)
they would have had to have started uh (33:38 - 33:44)
opening things up and started planning (33:41 - 33:45)
this (33:44 - 33:49)
well before uh (33:45 - 33:49)
well before things looked better (33:50 - 33:55)
for people being located in one central (33:53 - 33:56)
location (33:55 - 33:58)
i think yeah i mean i'm sure they have (33:56 - 33:59)
venues (33:58 - 34:02)
booked like like think of how many (33:59 - 34:05)
venues they they probably still have (34:02 - 34:07)
um uh yeah i don't know what the word is (34:05 - 34:08)
extensions on (34:07 - 34:12)
like like that they have that that they (34:08 - 34:13)
that we were supposed to go to they had (34:12 - 34:15)
that one in pittsburgh (34:13 - 34:17)
um i am sure there are still you know (34:15 - 34:19)
they have to eventually do that st (34:17 - 34:22)
louis event and that park probably has (34:19 - 34:23)
like okay we have (34:22 - 34:26)
uh august maybe if the august doesn't (34:23 - 34:27)
work out we have (34:26 - 34:29)
october if october doesn't work out we (34:27 - 34:30)
have you booked for (34:29 - 34:32)
i i'm sure something like that maybe (34:30 - 34:34)
exists because those parks (34:32 - 34:38)
slash cities want the tourists (34:34 - 34:40)
i think the bigger problem is not the (34:38 - 34:41)
space (34:40 - 34:43)
i think it's very easy to say like okay (34:41 - 34:45)
we got this huge park (34:43 - 34:47)
we're bringing in only 50 of the people (34:45 - 34:49)
we did last time so everyone's spacious (34:47 - 34:52)
wear a mask even if you're vaccinated i (34:49 - 34:54)
i think that's the easy part (34:52 - 34:55)
i think the hard part is you're bringing (34:54 - 34:57)
all people to a city (34:55 - 34:59)
and those people are going to go into (34:57 - 35:01)
restaurants and go into hotels and that (34:59 - 35:01)
is (35:01 - 35:05)
harder to control and niantic would feel (35:01 - 35:06)
responsible for that (35:05 - 35:08)
because they were there they're the (35:06 - 35:10)
people bringing everyone to the city (35:08 - 35:13)
uh even if it's like at you know half (35:10 - 35:13)
like when we (35:13 - 35:17)
when we went to mall of america i mean (35:13 - 35:18)
obviously you guys were just down the (35:17 - 35:19)
street (35:18 - 35:22)
i came out of town (35:19 - 35:25)
and even though and i got a hotel that (35:22 - 35:27)
was connected to mall of america (35:25 - 35:30)
and the mall was no i would say normally (35:27 - 35:31)
busy (35:30 - 35:34)
like uh i wouldn't say the mall that day (35:31 - 35:35)
was like oh (35:34 - 35:37)
like incredibly busy it was a little (35:35 - 35:38)
lighter than normal (35:37 - 35:41)
yeah yeah but the when we went into the (35:38 - 35:43)
hotel (35:41 - 35:47)
it it felt like i was at a convention (35:43 - 35:49)
like ever like i waited in line for 30 (35:47 - 35:50)
minutes (35:49 - 35:53)
um it like every like you had to wait in (35:50 - 35:55)
line to get up to your room because they (35:53 - 35:56)
were only allowing one person in (35:55 - 35:58)
um the elevator at a time and they had (35:56 - 36:00)
somebody managing the elevator if there (35:58 - 36:02)
it very much felt like i was at like a (36:00 - 36:03)
gen con where like (36:02 - 36:06)
there's too many people here and i just (36:03 - 36:08)
i can't even get to my room fast enough (36:06 - 36:09)
because i gotta wait in a line to get (36:08 - 36:11)
into an elevator like (36:09 - 36:13)
and that's what i would imag that's that (36:11 - 36:14)
i feel like is the problem with the (36:13 - 36:15)
physical go fest that (36:14 - 36:18)
the the fest itself the things around it (36:15 - 36:19)
of like waiting in line at a restaurant (36:18 - 36:21)
or the restaurant being too crowded or (36:19 - 36:21)
the (36:21 - 36:24)
hotel having a full lobby because people (36:21 - 36:25)
don't know where they're going or (36:24 - 36:25)
they're planning (36:25 - 36:28)
it's like (36:25 - 36:28)
but i would assume niantic would love to (36:30 - 36:34)
do the event for this (36:32 - 36:37)
because they love live events i just (36:34 - 36:39)
don't think (36:37 - 36:41)
i still feel they feel they have (36:39 - 36:42)
something to prove (36:41 - 36:46)
after year one right like week we can do (36:42 - 36:49)
live in person events and people love (36:46 - 36:51)
them (36:49 - 36:51)
so we're just gonna do it here it's july (36:52 - 36:57)
it'll be nice (36:55 - 36:59)
oh i'm still going to chicago i'm just (36:57 - 36:59)
going to pretend (36:59 - 37:01)
[Laughter] (36:59 - 37:03)
why would you willingly go to chicago (37:01 - 37:04)
you got to go (37:03 - 37:07)
once a year to remind yourself what (37:04 - 37:08)
awful place (37:07 - 37:11)
it is no you don't love the no service (37:08 - 37:15)
down this street i love it (37:11 - 37:15)
all right uh that's all the pokemon go (37:15 - 37:20)
news it was a lot this week but i think (37:18 - 37:21)

uh i won't say what the mysterious (43:17 - 43:21)
pokemon was i'll leave that to you guys (43:19 - 43:22)
i mean you can just read the press (43:21 - 43:23)
release if you want to (43:22 - 43:25)
uh new friends returning rivals an (43:23 - 43:28)
exciting adventure as the journey (43:25 - 43:29)
continues (43:28 - 43:31)
um but they do not have a date for when (43:29 - 43:33)
this series will continue but i believe (43:31 - 43:36)
it's done on netflix i believe the (43:33 - 43:38)
part four was the last part and that is (43:36 - 43:39)
good so if you've watched that you're (43:38 - 43:41)
all caught up (43:39 - 43:42)
um if you haven't watched it you have (43:41 - 43:44)
plenty of time you got pretty much (43:42 - 43:46)
probably all summer to catch up (43:44 - 43:49)
and then they (43:46 - 43:52)
didn't say that it'll be on netflix here (43:49 - 43:55)
i'm assuming i mean i thought somewhere (43:52 - 43:56)
else it said it's continuing on netflix (43:55 - 43:58)
but it doesn't say on pokemon.com (43:56 - 44:00)
it was poking around on hulu last night (43:58 - 44:02)
and there was some some pokemon anime on (44:00 - 44:04)
there (44:02 - 44:07)
yeah they have like seasons of something (44:04 - 44:10)
that's all i can't imagine that it's (44:07 - 44:13)
not on netflix (44:10 - 44:13)
why would they move it now like there (44:13 - 44:17)
would be an announcement that somebody (44:15 - 44:17)
got it (44:17 - 44:21)
if netflix wasn't it's like a free win (44:17 - 44:22)
for netflix they don't have to spend (44:21 - 44:25)
money making it yeah netflix has deep (44:22 - 44:28)
deep pockets and for scientific (44:25 - 44:29)
reference (44:28 - 44:32)
uh i believe although my (44:29 - 44:36)
research may be lacking uh there are 23 (44:32 - 44:39)
seasons of one piece (44:36 - 44:43)
so pokemon is is one more season (44:39 - 44:46)
running anime of all time (44:43 - 44:48)
how many episodes in a season of one (44:46 - 44:50)
piece though uh it varies (44:48 - 44:54)
oh mike oh my (44:50 - 44:58)
that is like too many season 19 had 107 (44:54 - 44:59)
episodes (44:58 - 45:03)
season one had 61. it's it varies (44:59 - 45:05)
pokemon (45:03 - 45:05)
and i keep restarting it and i get (45:11 - 45:14)
there's (45:14 - 45:17)
i get to one part where i'm like i can't (45:14 - 45:18)
with the yelling (45:17 - 45:20)
right now and then i forget where i left (45:18 - 45:22)
off so that i'm like skipping through (45:20 - 45:24)

be the most (45:24 - 45:28)
weebest thing that will be said all of (45:26 - 45:32)

the booster packs here i know one is one (46:43 - 46:46)
is battle styles (46:45 - 46:49)
it looks like one is darkness ablaze i (46:46 - 46:51)
can't see the other two (46:49 - 46:53)
uh they look okay though they don't look (46:51 - 46:55)
i don't see any steam siege or crimson (46:53 - 46:56)
invasion back there (46:55 - 47:00)
thank goodness who (46:56 - 47:00)
i don't know the card situation anymore (47:01 - 47:08)
at my targets they are you have to show (47:05 - 47:10)
up at a friday at 8 a.m (47:08 - 47:14)
i saw on twitter people (47:10 - 47:16)
taking pictures of their targets and it (47:14 - 47:17)
being like fully (47:16 - 47:20)
stocked like the old days (47:17 - 47:23)
like oh not 20. not my target not the (47:20 - 47:24)
one by my house (47:23 - 47:29)
20 etbs and um (47:24 - 47:29)
30 of these boxes and booster that's not (47:29 - 47:33)
my target (47:32 - 47:35)
uh so i don't i don't know what magical (47:33 - 47:37)
target they went to where it's like (47:35 - 47:38)
completely stocked but (47:37 - 47:42)
uh no not not me (47:38 - 47:42)
if yeah all my target has are well first (47:44 - 47:49)
okay right there's a left and right (47:47 - 47:51)
situation and i think (47:49 - 47:54)
most targets are divided in the same (47:51 - 47:56)
most targets i've been to are divided in (47:54 - 47:57)
the same way (47:56 - 47:59)
there's four there are four target (47:57 - 48:01)
layouts seeking as a person who (47:59 - 48:03)
lives in the target town there are four (48:01 - 48:04)
very distinct target layouts and yours (48:03 - 48:06)
will be in one of four (48:04 - 48:09)
well what i've always noticed is there's (48:06 - 48:09)
one half (48:09 - 48:13)
that is card games and such that people (48:09 - 48:16)
actually want so that'll be your mtv (48:13 - 48:17)
mtgs pokemon (48:16 - 48:20)
and yu-gi-ohs that'll be one side and (48:17 - 48:21)
then there's the other side which is (48:20 - 48:22)
like (48:21 - 48:26)
baseball cards weird like loot box type (48:22 - 48:29)
blind box things tiny things that nobody (48:26 - 48:30)
actually ever (48:29 - 48:33)
buys so that side is always full and (48:30 - 48:33)
then (48:33 - 48:37)
now at the target by my house uh still (48:33 - 48:38)
no pokemon (48:37 - 48:42)
no yugioh i think that might be (48:38 - 48:44)
someplace else in the store and then (48:42 - 48:48)
only mtg sets that nobody wants (48:44 - 48:52)
anyways my target (48:48 - 48:53)
closest to me the busiest target in (48:52 - 48:55)
minnesota is (48:53 - 48:58)
card bear there is nothing there are a (48:55 - 48:58)
couple (48:58 - 49:03)
of calheim super booster packs of (48:58 - 49:06)
magic the ones that nobody wants nothing (49:03 - 49:06)
else there's (49:06 - 49:10)
nothing left they are just bare shelves (49:06 - 49:14)
the next set chilling rains (49:10 - 49:17)
i didn't even see the standard online (49:14 - 49:19)
sites like troll and toad or cool stuff (49:17 - 49:21)
inc or (49:19 - 49:23)
what was the other one uh anyways i (49:21 - 49:24)
haven't even seen them put up pre-orders (49:23 - 49:25)
for chilling grains and now we're like (49:24 - 49:29)
a month away from it and normally (49:25 - 49:32)
uh like i pre-ordered battle styles (49:29 - 49:33)
which came out in march (49:32 - 49:36)
i pre-ordered that in no well that was (49:33 - 49:39)
amazon but i ordered battle styles off (49:36 - 49:40)
cool stuff inc (49:39 - 49:44)
for 120 which i normally (49:40 - 49:45)
have always paid 99 for we've talked (49:44 - 49:48)
about this um (49:45 - 49:53)
i ordered that in january and then (49:48 - 49:55)
but i ordered late like i think they put (49:53 - 49:57)
them up in december because they were (49:55 - 49:58)
already (49:57 - 50:00)
they were already sold out of etbs when (49:58 - 50:01)
i went to go order (50:00 - 50:03)
[Music] (50:01 - 50:06)
a booster box but they haven't put (50:03 - 50:07)
anything up yet and i (50:06 - 50:11)
i have a friend who (50:07 - 50:13)
works with a distributor because he (50:11 - 50:15)
sells cards (50:13 - 50:20)
and he said that like the allocation for (50:15 - 50:20)
chilling reigns was smaller than battle (50:20 - 50:24)
styles (50:23 - 50:25)
and battle styles was already smaller (50:24 - 50:27)
than (50:25 - 50:30)
like vivid voltage and darkness ablaze (50:27 - 50:31)
even though (50:30 - 50:34)
like three months ago they said (50:31 - 50:36)
we're ramping up production we're making (50:34 - 50:38)
more we understand people can't find (50:36 - 50:42)
cards i (50:38 - 50:42)
i don't know it's not it's still not fun (50:43 - 50:47)
still not fun to just collect pokemon (50:45 - 50:49)
cards at this point (50:47 - 50:52)
it's real rough it's dark days (50:49 - 50:54)
it'll pass soon money started going to (50:52 - 50:56)
start going into them nfts (50:54 - 50:58)
people won't want physical stuff anymore (50:56 - 51:02)
actually should we start a pokemon (50:58 - 51:02)
no i guess you could own (51:02 - 51:06)
you could own this for a second (51:05 - 51:09)
everybody if you want if you want some (51:06 - 51:11)
something let me just say get your (51:09 - 51:13)
ethereum wallet (51:11 - 51:16)
set up it's coming (51:13 - 51:18)
well tell me about your five hours of (51:16 - 51:20)
pokemon snap (51:18 - 51:23)
okay so here's the issue because (51:20 - 51:26)
even though yes number one love pokemon (51:23 - 51:27)
snap (51:26 - 51:29)
love playing it i have added it into my (51:27 - 51:31)
rotation of something that i play (51:29 - 51:34)
every single day but my love has taken a (51:31 - 51:35)
dark turn (51:34 - 51:39)
uh-oh because kim's only been out for (51:35 - 51:41)
nine days (51:39 - 51:45)
look things happen fast even though (51:41 - 51:48)
i love playing it a lot and like i will (51:45 - 51:50)
literally sit down and it's like because (51:48 - 51:51)
i have like my three games that i'm (51:50 - 51:53)
gonna do and like every time i sit down (51:51 - 51:54)
i play games i do a little bit of this (51:53 - 51:55)
one a little bit of that one a little (51:54 - 51:56)
bit of that one (51:55 - 52:00)
so pokemon snap is in there (51:56 - 52:00)
i really like chasing that meganium (52:00 - 52:09)
and i think i've chased the meganium (52:05 - 52:13)
probably 30 times now (52:09 - 52:13)
so of my five hours of play (52:13 - 52:20)
three hours is me chasing meganium two (52:17 - 52:21)
hours (52:20 - 52:23)
is daytime in the first park night time (52:21 - 52:24)
in the first park (52:23 - 52:27)
and probably 15 minutes of the jungle (52:24 - 52:28)
because i've gotten it finally gotten (52:27 - 52:29)
into the jungle (52:28 - 52:32)
i mean that's fine that's good i i (52:29 - 52:34)
repeated the park a lot (52:32 - 52:36)
after yeah that was like the first (52:34 - 52:38)
course i repeated over and over again (52:36 - 52:41)
to try to to try to like figure out the (52:38 - 52:42)
secrets (52:41 - 52:45)
i find the game to be so difficult and (52:42 - 52:45)
i'm like (52:45 - 52:47)
i'm gonna get it i'm gonna get it i'm (52:45 - 52:49)
gonna do it again and i'm gonna get it (52:47 - 52:50)
this time (52:49 - 52:52)
and then i don't get it all right i'm (52:50 - 52:54)
gonna get it (52:52 - 52:57)
uh i have an update about my controls it (52:54 - 52:59)
turns out because i've got a pro (52:57 - 53:00)
controller (52:59 - 53:02)
it's helped slightly but apparently my (53:00 - 53:05)
joy cons have developed the drift (53:02 - 53:07)
why i think i'm fighting i was fighting (53:05 - 53:08)
against them more than probably (53:07 - 53:10)
everybody else was (53:08 - 53:13)
um also i worked very hard to get (53:10 - 53:18)
my pride picture up completed and done (53:13 - 53:21)
so all of you listeners go to my snap (53:18 - 53:22)
page (53:21 - 53:24)
for june i have a pride picture up it is (53:22 - 53:27)
very important (53:24 - 53:30)
go support my happy pride photo on (53:27 - 53:31)
pokemon snap thank you (53:30 - 53:34)
one thing i keep having an issue with (53:31 - 53:38)
mentally is keeping in mind (53:34 - 53:41)
that the the circle selector (53:38 - 53:45)
is more important than the camera (53:41 - 53:48)
like so the left stick is more important (53:45 - 53:50)
than the right stick and the left stick (53:48 - 53:52)
should be on the pokemon that you're (53:50 - 53:54)
trying to take a picture of (53:52 - 53:57)
because i've had situations (53:54 - 54:01)
where i have like a ductless that is (53:57 - 54:01)
like (54:01 - 54:03)
smiling and its wings are up and it's (54:01 - 54:05)
just the happiest little ducklet (54:03 - 54:09)
but my circle was pointing at a swanna (54:05 - 54:12)
um (54:09 - 54:12)
professor mirror you need to get better (54:19 - 54:24)
glasses because your prescription's bad (54:22 - 54:26)
because you are clearly missing the (54:24 - 54:28)
thing first of all (54:26 - 54:30)
i can't get it more in the center second (54:28 - 54:32)
of all this thing is gorgeous (54:30 - 54:35)
i took a snap i took a screenshot of (54:32 - 54:36)
when i beat the game (54:35 - 54:40)
uh so there is no winning at this game (54:36 - 54:41)
it is a (54:40 - 54:44)
constant life devotion yeah so getting (54:41 - 54:46)
credits uh so for me it was uh (54:44 - 54:48)
five thousand seven hundred photos taken (54:46 - 54:51)
uh 27 hours and nine minutes (54:48 - 54:54)
and then the total pokedex score was 1.4 (54:51 - 54:55)
million (54:54 - 54:58)
um and since then i am up to 40 hours (54:55 - 55:01)
of playing and my pokedex score is at (54:58 - 55:05)
2 million um and i think i'm at like 7 (55:01 - 55:06)
000 photos because i think you get like (55:05 - 55:07)
a little (55:06 - 55:10)
uh achievement unlock at 7 000. (55:07 - 55:13)
so yeah 40 hours in about 10 days (55:10 - 55:17)
uh i said this last week i'll say it (55:13 - 55:18)
again i'm glad i was wrong (55:17 - 55:20)
i didn't think this game would be longer (55:18 - 55:22)
than 10 hours (55:20 - 55:25)
and i am still like (55:22 - 55:27)
19 pokemon away from finding every (55:25 - 55:28)
pokemon (55:27 - 55:31)
because i think there's like 214 (55:28 - 55:34)
and that doesn't even count getting one (55:31 - 55:35)
two three (55:34 - 55:37)
four stars of every pokemon that (55:35 - 55:38)
obviously doesn't count the (55:37 - 55:42)
4k of everything there are some (55:38 - 55:45)
things that don't specifically matter (55:42 - 55:45)
but (55:45 - 55:47)
could matter to you in the sense of (55:45 - 55:49)
wanting to be a completionist (55:47 - 55:51)
so for example like there is every form (55:49 - 55:53)
of vivian in this game (55:51 - 55:56)
uh but you could just just say like well (55:53 - 55:56)
i just took (55:56 - 55:59)
four one two one two three four vivian (55:56 - 56:02)
and they're all 4k so i'm done there but (55:59 - 56:04)
there's like an achievement (56:02 - 56:06)
a title i think they're called or if you (56:04 - 56:08)
get all the vivian interlocks that (56:06 - 56:11)
so um even though that your album (56:08 - 56:11)
doesn't (56:11 - 56:15)
necessarily remember all (56:11 - 56:18)
16 forms of 17 forms of vivian something (56:15 - 56:18)
like that (56:18 - 56:21)
does it also have pokeball form the (56:18 - 56:24)
pokeball form is in the game yes (56:21 - 56:27)
yeah every every form is even the (56:24 - 56:29)
fancy form all of them are they're like (56:27 - 56:31)
really hard to get (56:29 - 56:33)
uh i think we talked about this a little (56:31 - 56:36)
last week that (56:33 - 56:36)
snap is also a puzzle game (56:37 - 56:45)
and i have still at this point 40 hours (56:40 - 56:47)
in i haven't looked anything up (56:45 - 56:50)
um sometimes i i i guess i (56:47 - 56:52)
i spoil myself when i'm looking at other (56:50 - 56:53)
people's pictures like for example (56:52 - 56:55)
there's a picture of (56:53 - 56:58)
kangaskhan holding its her child up (56:55 - 57:00)
and then there's like a minior in the (56:58 - 57:03)
sky and it's like oh (57:00 - 57:06)
i've never got kangaskhan to do that (57:03 - 57:08)
and i bet that's the four star because (57:06 - 57:10)
that's what i'm missing (57:08 - 57:13)
so how did you so now that i like that (57:10 - 57:14)
spoiled for me but like there's still (57:13 - 57:16)
the puzzle of like how did you get (57:14 - 57:17)
minier here (57:16 - 57:20)
to get kangaskhan to lift up so like (57:17 - 57:22)
it's a spoiler but also (57:20 - 57:24)
it was like oh cool now i know how to do (57:22 - 57:26)
that um but i haven't gone out of my way (57:24 - 57:27)
to look (57:26 - 57:30)
up anything i i will say that the game (57:27 - 57:32)
[Music] (57:30 - 57:34)
the research tax i said it yesterday the (57:32 - 57:36)
last time and it confirmed it (57:34 - 57:38)
the research tasks some of the things (57:36 - 57:39)
that they asked (57:38 - 57:43)
for are the four star picture (57:39 - 57:45)
so that it will ask for a specific oh (57:43 - 57:47)
i've seen it do this (57:45 - 57:49)
see if you can get a picture of it it (57:47 - 57:51)
doesn't tell you (57:49 - 57:51)
that's the the len talk (57:52 - 57:55)
that picture that you're mentioning i (57:57 - 58:00)
know that that's a task (57:59 - 58:03)
because i saw it and i went oh i have no (58:00 - 58:05)
idea how you do that or where that what (58:03 - 58:06)
happened (58:05 - 58:07)
those are the things that keep me going (58:06 - 58:09)
back and back and back and it's like (58:07 - 58:10)
like the one of them was (58:09 - 58:14)
uh catch a photo of (58:10 - 58:18)
uh is it quagsire like quagsire (58:14 - 58:21)
jumping and it's like i i just got it i (58:18 - 58:22)
got it right down (58:21 - 58:25)
and there was a uh a beautiful eye (58:22 - 58:27)
like flying in from the side and (58:25 - 58:29)
quagsire is jumping (58:27 - 58:33)
and i was like yes i got it (58:29 - 58:36)
i got it but i'm on guard (58:33 - 58:40)
oh now that i'm like close to (58:36 - 58:41)
finishing the pokedex and i've seen (58:40 - 58:43)
credits and now i'm just trying to beat (58:41 - 58:45)
scores and stuff (58:43 - 58:48)
i am feeling that like grind (58:45 - 58:50)
in the sense of i kind of just want to (58:48 - 58:51)
look stuff up now (58:50 - 58:54)
like there are things in the game (58:51 - 58:58)
where ah (58:54 - 59:01)
i guess i guess the word is hard (58:58 - 59:03)
where like i don't i don't this game's (59:01 - 59:05)
not hard right like they're myself (59:03 - 59:08)
lies this game is real hard for me (59:05 - 59:12)
the game itself is not hard you could go (59:08 - 59:13)
through the entire game (59:12 - 59:16)
get nothing but like bronze star photos (59:13 - 59:17)
and (59:16 - 59:19)
you will see credits right like the if (59:17 - 59:21)
you want to experience the story (59:19 - 59:23)
which uh in the audio version i'm doing (59:21 - 59:25)
air quotes story because it like (59:23 - 59:28)
boy does that i'm learning about the (59:25 - 59:29)
illumina (59:28 - 59:33)
phenomenon and the mystery around (59:29 - 59:33)
maybe we'll talk about the story next (59:36 - 59:40)
week just to give people time to finish (59:38 - 59:41)
it but (59:40 - 59:46)
i got things 12 hours yeah (59:41 - 59:49)
or will anderson time 100 hours like if (59:46 - 59:50)
you just if you just want to see credits (59:49 - 59:52)
the game is easy (59:50 - 59:55)
there are things where you (59:52 - 59:58)
you have to be very precise and you have (59:55 - 59:59)
to (59:58 - 60:01)
do a lot of trial and error but the (59:59 - 60:03)
problem and i think this is what makes (60:01 - 60:05)
this is why some people might say like (60:03 - 60:07)
the game is hard (60:05 - 60:09)
the game doesn't give you feedback you (60:07 - 60:11)
don't know (60:09 - 60:13)
what is working or not working without (60:11 - 60:16)
just trial and error and sinking time in (60:13 - 60:18)
100 i don't think i don't think that's (60:16 - 60:19)
like (60:18 - 60:22)
i don't think it's i don't know if fair (60:19 - 60:23)
is the right word (60:22 - 60:25)
uh but i remember when travis was on the (60:23 - 60:27)
program he was talking about (60:25 - 60:30)
uh they were talking about a specific (60:27 - 60:31)
kind of (60:30 - 60:34)
tv show oh gosh what was it (60:31 - 60:38)
uh but their their example was like (60:34 - 60:41)
no it was a podcast it was um it was one (60:38 - 60:43)
of those audio dramas kind of like (60:41 - 60:46)
welcome to night vale and and he and (60:43 - 60:47)
they said specifically (60:46 - 60:50)
the show is only mysterious because (60:47 - 60:52)
they're purposely holding out so much (60:50 - 60:53)
information (60:52 - 60:55)
yeah yeah and that is the thing they're (60:53 - 60:56)
using against you (60:55 - 60:59)
where is if they said one or two things (60:56 - 61:01)
it would make sense but the only reason (60:59 - 61:03)
the mystery is there is because they're (61:01 - 61:05)
withholding a lot of information (61:03 - 61:07)
and they give it to you later to be like (61:05 - 61:09)
oh my gosh didn't you never would have (61:07 - 61:10)
thought of this (61:09 - 61:12)
and it's it's this weird trope and ever (61:10 - 61:13)
since they said that (61:12 - 61:16)
i always thought about it of like you (61:13 - 61:17)
kind of see through the facade that (61:16 - 61:18)
they're putting up (61:17 - 61:19)
yes this is called uh death note (61:18 - 61:22)
plotting right here (61:19 - 61:25)
so we're i'm watching an anime that is (61:22 - 61:27)
doing this exact thing and luckily the (61:25 - 61:28)
anime is still (61:27 - 61:31)
really good but i'm getting to the point (61:28 - 61:32)
in the anime (61:31 - 61:34)
which is so what i was reincarnated oh i (61:32 - 61:36)
was reincarnated as a spider so what (61:34 - 61:40)
it's fun but (61:36 - 61:40)
they withhold a major point of (61:40 - 61:44)
information (61:43 - 61:47)
for 12 episodes (61:44 - 61:49)
and then when they finally reveal it (61:47 - 61:51)
you're like (61:49 - 61:54)
well no wonder nothing was making sense (61:51 - 61:57)
like you you needed to tell us this up (61:54 - 61:59)
front (61:57 - 62:01)
because i we've been literally sitting (61:59 - 62:03)
here going (62:01 - 62:06)
what is even happening in this show it (62:03 - 62:07)
just doesn't make sense (62:06 - 62:11)
i actually appreciate it in in (62:07 - 62:13)
pokemon snap though because when i have (62:11 - 62:14)
those moments (62:13 - 62:17)
of oh let me just like fidget with the (62:14 - 62:19)
buttons and wait i'll do a scan i'll (62:17 - 62:21)
throw a fluff through oh wait something (62:19 - 62:22)
happened and i'm like oh something (62:21 - 62:23)
happened (62:22 - 62:25)
okay okay i'm gonna go through it again (62:23 - 62:26)
and remember (62:25 - 62:29)
to do it on purpose next time well i (62:26 - 62:31)
always forget that certain ones (62:29 - 62:34)
react only to the scan sound (62:31 - 62:37)
yeah you got you got to hit that scan (62:34 - 62:37)
yeah but (62:37 - 62:39)
you you start to get a spider web in the (62:37 - 62:42)
jungle i keep going too far and i don't (62:39 - 62:44)
turn around to get back to it (62:42 - 62:46)
but you you start i i feel like at least (62:44 - 62:47)
for me (62:46 - 62:51)
it it doesn't become a fun mechanic (62:47 - 62:52)
and i think at the end of the day games (62:51 - 62:54)
need to be fun for you to want to go (62:52 - 62:56)
back like the loop has to be fun and (62:54 - 62:56)
good (62:56 - 62:58)
and it is but then there's like a point (62:56 - 63:00)
of frustration (62:58 - 63:02)
for example in the snow level there's (63:00 - 63:04)
two stoms (63:02 - 63:06)
and i can't get good pictures of them (63:04 - 63:08)
and i know (63:06 - 63:10)
you can get good pictures of them i can (63:08 - 63:12)
only get like bronze (63:10 - 63:14)
one star pictures of them and i see them (63:12 - 63:16)
and it's a very short window and i know (63:14 - 63:17)
that something needs to happen (63:16 - 63:19)
and i've gone through the snow level a (63:17 - 63:20)
dozen times and i (63:19 - 63:23)
cannot figure it out okay and the game (63:20 - 63:24)
doesn't give you (63:23 - 63:26)
any feedback which is this is the (63:24 - 63:27)
problem (63:26 - 63:30)
like there is nothing you can do (63:27 - 63:32)
well i i guess there are things you've (63:30 - 63:33)
got to solve that mystery (63:32 - 63:36)
so this is the thing that that i sort of (63:33 - 63:38)
discovered because spoiler spoiler (63:36 - 63:39)
spoiler (63:38 - 63:40)
i know the two numb that you're talking (63:39 - 63:43)
about it's at the bottom of (63:40 - 63:44)
you go down the hill and then there's a (63:43 - 63:47)
there's a hill there there (63:44 - 63:49)
is as i was flying down the hill and hit (63:47 - 63:51)
the scan button there are (63:49 - 63:53)
a number of them hidden in the tree (63:51 - 63:55)
there's a thousand (63:53 - 63:59)
that you fly past and i'm like well (63:55 - 64:03)
stop i need them i need to i did you (63:59 - 64:05)
never told me (64:03 - 64:07)
at all that there's a one there's a tree (64:05 - 64:08)
that i'm flying past and two that (64:07 - 64:09)
there's things (64:08 - 64:11)
in the tree because i had to use but of (64:09 - 64:12)
course there are (64:11 - 64:14)
of course there are but there's a lot of (64:12 - 64:16)
things that there's a lot of trees in (64:14 - 64:17)
this game that don't have anything in (64:16 - 64:18)
them (64:17 - 64:20)
i think that until you've gone and (64:18 - 64:21)
raised your research level and the (64:20 - 64:23)
pokemon like you more and then they (64:21 - 64:25)
start to show up (64:23 - 64:26)
i mean there weren't any bouffalont in (64:25 - 64:28)
the daytime of the (64:26 - 64:30)
park at the beginning until you were (64:28 - 64:31)
away across (64:30 - 64:32)
the metal they were way in the (64:31 - 64:34)
background (64:32 - 64:37)
i'm assuming that the developer (64:34 - 64:41)
probably made some obscure (64:37 - 64:44)
or or what not is because they want they (64:41 - 64:45)
wanted their customer (64:44 - 64:47)
they wanted the players to have these (64:45 - 64:49)
conversations and i (64:47 - 64:52)
appreciate that a ton i just wish that (64:49 - 64:53)
the game (64:52 - 64:54)
gave a little bit more feedback or the (64:53 - 64:56)
game realized that you went through this (64:54 - 64:58)
level 20 times (64:56 - 65:01)
and that it maybe (64:58 - 65:04)
suggests things for you to do or try (65:01 - 65:05)
they kind of do that up front (65:04 - 65:08)
like um what with will what will was (65:05 - 65:09)
saying (65:08 - 65:11)
uh but if you miss those like i don't is (65:09 - 65:12)
there a summary can i (65:11 - 65:14)
go back and see all the things oh no no (65:12 - 65:15)
no you actually have to pay attention (65:14 - 65:17)
and read when people are talking to you (65:15 - 65:20)
but like if i if i accidentally did (65:17 - 65:20)
something (65:20 - 65:25)
like um i don't know made clawlets or (65:20 - 65:28)
shoot a very powerful hydro pump (65:25 - 65:30)
if i accidentally did that and that was (65:28 - 65:32)
one of the tasks (65:30 - 65:34)
there is no again there's no feedback to (65:32 - 65:35)
be like (65:34 - 65:38)
oh you did this and this and clawlitzer (65:35 - 65:39)
did this (65:38 - 65:41)
like there's no summary i can go back to (65:39 - 65:42)
see like how did i do this activation (65:41 - 65:45)
how did i make this pokemon do that (65:42 - 65:47)
and i don't think like this is not a (65:45 - 65:48)
this (65:47 - 65:50)
this is like a down this is like a (65:48 - 65:51)
complaint for (65:50 - 65:54)
like if you are in the hardcore pokemon (65:51 - 65:56)
snap situation (65:54 - 65:59)
like it everything before this is still (65:56 - 66:00)
a hundred percent worth it (65:59 - 66:02)
but there is again going back to the (66:00 - 66:03)
snow level there (66:02 - 66:06)
there is a point near the end where (66:03 - 66:08)
there's like a sphere (66:06 - 66:11)
that is like floating on a lazy river (66:08 - 66:11)
and (66:11 - 66:13)
if you just happen to hit him at the (66:11 - 66:15)
certain point with an apple he stops (66:13 - 66:18)
and then a swine nub will cross over him (66:15 - 66:19)
he'll cross he'll use this field to (66:18 - 66:21)
cross over the river but then the swine (66:19 - 66:23)
nub doesn't do anything (66:21 - 66:25)
but then like why is that swine up (66:23 - 66:28)
crossing the river (66:25 - 66:30)
to get to the other side right obviously (66:28 - 66:32)
and then there's like a little um (66:30 - 66:34)
like air burst coming out of the ground (66:32 - 66:36)
so you're like okay i gotta get the (66:34 - 66:36)
swine up to do (66:36 - 66:38)
that i'm assuming i gotta get the swine (66:36 - 66:40)
up to do the air burst (66:38 - 66:41)
but when you're doing when you're doing (66:40 - 66:43)
that level like 12 times (66:41 - 66:45)
at a certain point you're just like what (66:43 - 66:46)
is the solution (66:45 - 66:50)
you know yeah this is just like to me (66:46 - 66:53)
it's very almost like a throwback to 80s (66:50 - 66:55)
video games (66:53 - 66:57)
where it's like the difficulty was just (66:55 - 66:58)
in discovery (66:57 - 67:01)
when discovering them (66:58 - 67:01)
that's at the end of the level yeah so (67:05 - 67:11)
you have to go through that like that is (67:08 - 67:14)
the challenge (67:11 - 67:16)
like each level that level in particular (67:14 - 67:18)
is a little bit longer which is cool (67:16 - 67:19)
some levels are shorter some are longer (67:18 - 67:20)
that one's a little bit longer it's like (67:19 - 67:22)
three minutes even if you decide to (67:20 - 67:24)
skip everything and hold the r button to (67:22 - 67:26)
zoom past (67:24 - 67:27)
you're not going that much faster so (67:26 - 67:29)
you're like instead of waiting three (67:27 - 67:31)
minutes you're waiting like (67:29 - 67:33)
a minute 40. and then you have to be (67:31 - 67:35)
precise and if you mess it up (67:33 - 67:37)
there's the ending and guess what you (67:35 - 67:38)
got to do it again that's what you gotta (67:37 - 67:38)
do and (67:38 - 67:40)
this sounds like a complaint and i guess (67:38 - 67:42)
it is a weaker part of the game (67:40 - 67:45)
but your your only other solution at (67:42 - 67:46)
that point is (67:45 - 67:49)
okay just go to serbia and look it up (67:46 - 67:49)
uh i will say that in i (67:49 - 67:55)
got that level of frustration in getting (67:52 - 67:56)
my pride picture (67:55 - 68:01)
because the solution (67:56 - 68:01)
isn't obvious like there isn't an (68:03 - 68:08)
obvious solution to how to make that (68:06 - 68:10)
event happen and i ended up looking it (68:08 - 68:11)
up because i'm like i am (68:10 - 68:14)
i have done this course (68:11 - 68:14)
10 times now and i have checked (68:15 - 68:22)
everything that i can possibly look at i (68:19 - 68:24)
have scanned (68:22 - 68:27)
every section that i can possibly scan (68:24 - 68:31)
and i am not finding it i just cannot (68:27 - 68:33)
find the solution and i looked it up and (68:31 - 68:35)
it is so (68:33 - 68:37)
it is so precise that has to happen at (68:35 - 68:38)
such a precise (68:37 - 68:41)
moment that if you (68:38 - 68:44)
miss it it you just have missed it you (68:41 - 68:48)
you have to know that it's there and (68:44 - 68:51)
stuff i i don't know how you stumble (68:48 - 68:51)
upon (68:51 - 68:55)
that uh (68:51 - 68:56)
i think it's okay to look things up i (68:55 - 68:58)
think yeah i think (68:56 - 68:59)
yeah i think it totally is it's a (68:58 - 69:01)
throwback to like (68:59 - 69:03)
being on the playground with your (69:01 - 69:05)
friends and being like (69:03 - 69:07)
hey did you get this thing in in pokemon (69:05 - 69:09)
snap and you're like no i didn't figure (69:07 - 69:10)
that and they're like okay so this is (69:09 - 69:11)
what you got to do and then you're like (69:10 - 69:13)
get so excited because your friend (69:11 - 69:14)
finally told you like (69:13 - 69:16)
that thing that they figured out well my (69:14 - 69:17)
friend of the internet tells me a lot of (69:16 - 69:18)
things that's (69:17 - 69:21)
that's where we are right 2021 yeah (69:18 - 69:22)
right it's not i mean it doesn't look (69:21 - 69:22)
like (69:22 - 69:26)
avenue school in 1984. anyway once you (69:22 - 69:27)
know the solution (69:26 - 69:29)
it's it's like knowing a puzzle like (69:27 - 69:31)
once you know the solution you have it (69:29 - 69:33)
um and it's it's why it's kind of hard (69:31 - 69:34)
to (69:33 - 69:36)
yeah you have to execute it but it's (69:34 - 69:37)
kind of like playing portal (69:36 - 69:39)
twice like the first time you play (69:37 - 69:41)
portal you're like oh my gosh this is (69:39 - 69:42)
amazing and then the second time you (69:41 - 69:43)
play it you're like (69:42 - 69:45)
well i know the solution right like yeah (69:43 - 69:46)
but i still played it six times because (69:45 - 69:48)
i really yeah (69:46 - 69:51)
yeah um yeah i mean part of it (69:48 - 69:54)
is also that like even if you know the (69:51 - 69:55)
solution (69:54 - 69:58)
sometimes getting the game to do what (69:55 - 70:00)
you want because the aim (69:58 - 70:04)
the aim system and the physics system is (70:00 - 70:07)
weird those those the illuminati balls i (70:04 - 70:08)
feel like are perfect (70:07 - 70:12)
the i feel like are are they don't (70:08 - 70:16)
they they are locked too early (70:12 - 70:16)
they fall off quick quick for me you've (70:17 - 70:21)
got to like (70:20 - 70:23)
you've got to like have the pokemon out (70:21 - 70:25)
of the frame to aim it so it goes far (70:23 - 70:27)
enough and then it's like that whole (70:25 - 70:28)
mechanic of (70:27 - 70:31)
i think they're both they both react (70:28 - 70:33)
slightly weird and they both are (70:31 - 70:34)
different from each other like they did (70:33 - 70:36)
add weight to the fruit because it does (70:34 - 70:37)
have fruit (70:36 - 70:38)
it would have weight as a physical (70:37 - 70:40)
object um (70:38 - 70:43)
but having to do things where you (70:40 - 70:46)
are using the exact same targeting (70:43 - 70:47)
system for two things that have (70:46 - 70:50)
two different physics gets a little (70:47 - 70:51)
frustrating sometimes because it's like (70:50 - 70:52)
i have to (70:51 - 70:55)
not only try to get this apple exactly (70:52 - 70:56)
where you want me to do it but then i (70:55 - 70:57)
have to (70:56 - 71:00)
switch over to get the orb and it's run (70:57 - 71:02)
off of a different physics and i have to (71:00 - 71:03)
try it (71:02 - 71:05)
it can be i like that they have two (71:03 - 71:06)
different things like i don't think (71:05 - 71:07)
that's (71:06 - 71:09)
yeah i don't think it's a problem i (71:07 - 71:11)
think it's it is (71:09 - 71:14)
it is one of those things where it is (71:11 - 71:15)
much like older games (71:14 - 71:18)
you have to learn how to control the (71:15 - 71:20)
game (71:18 - 71:22)
by playing it over and over and over (71:20 - 71:24)
again and i do get (71:22 - 71:26)
i do not games where it's like you're (71:24 - 71:27)
teaching me (71:26 - 71:30)
how to interact with your game in a way (71:27 - 71:32)
that only applies to your game (71:30 - 71:34)
and hey we haven't looking for life (71:32 - 71:36)
lessons from pokemon snap they don't (71:34 - 71:39)
even teach us how to do already (71:36 - 71:40)
photographs (71:39 - 71:42)
in the uh on the other side of the coin (71:40 - 71:44)
there i there's a mythical pokemon i (71:42 - 71:46)
don't want to spoil what the mythical is (71:44 - 71:47)
there's a mythical pokemon in one of the (71:46 - 71:49)
end levels and they appear right at the (71:47 - 71:51)
beginning (71:49 - 71:53)
and the first time i saw them i took a (71:51 - 71:54)
picture of them (71:53 - 71:55)
and then i didn't see them for the whole (71:54 - 71:57)
level but i was like cool i didn't know (71:55 - 71:58)
they were in this level (71:57 - 71:59)
they just showed up i don't think i did (71:58 - 72:01)
anything particular for them to show up (71:59 - 72:05)
and then the second time i went through (72:01 - 72:07)
and i threw an apple at them and they (72:05 - 72:08)
didn't do anything and i got a better (72:07 - 72:09)
picture that time (72:08 - 72:11)
and then the third time i went through (72:09 - 72:12)
the level i was like i'm going to throw (72:11 - 72:14)
the illuminati ball at them (72:12 - 72:15)
and i did and they did something (72:14 - 72:17)
different and i was like cool and that (72:15 - 72:19)
is the sense of discovery the game is (72:17 - 72:20)
like trying to do and i appreciate that (72:19 - 72:21)
yeah (72:20 - 72:23)
and when it happens it happens in (72:21 - 72:24)
multiple levels (72:23 - 72:26)
that's right the sense of discovery i (72:24 - 72:28)
think is such an accurate way to (72:26 - 72:29)
describe it right because the first time (72:28 - 72:31)
you do the meganium (72:29 - 72:35)
level meganium's alone the second time (72:31 - 72:35)
you do it (72:35 - 72:37)
there's somebody with meganium and it's (72:35 - 72:40)
like it's a pokemon i absolutely do not (72:37 - 72:40)
care about (72:40 - 72:44)
one wit but the minute the (72:40 - 72:47)
level started and i was like wait (72:44 - 72:49)
there's another dude here that's having (72:47 - 72:51)
fun and doing other stuff i'm like (72:49 - 72:55)
oh this is amazing they do sense of (72:51 - 72:56)
discovery (72:55 - 72:59)
very well and then um so when i (72:56 - 73:00)
when i hit that mythical with a pester (72:59 - 73:03)
ball then they appeared later on the (73:00 - 73:04)
level (73:03 - 73:07)
oh alumni ball they appeared later on (73:04 - 73:08)
the level (73:07 - 73:11)
and kinder gentler future please and so (73:08 - 73:12)
i hit them (73:11 - 73:15)
with a pester ball again and they did (73:12 - 73:16)
something (73:15 - 73:21)
and then my thought process is (73:16 - 73:21)
i'm missing something and my thought (73:22 - 73:24)
process is i'm missing something here (73:23 - 73:25)
because i (73:24 - 73:27)
they're not close enough to me i'm (73:25 - 73:28)
missing the four star picture i got the (73:27 - 73:30)
one the two and the three (73:28 - 73:32)
they're has to they have to do one last (73:30 - 73:33)
thing (73:32 - 73:35)
i know where they are in the first area (73:33 - 73:36)
i know now how to move into the second (73:35 - 73:38)
area there must be a third area before (73:36 - 73:40)
the level is over for them to move (73:38 - 73:43)
and so fast forward to my seventh time (73:40 - 73:44)
playing the level (73:43 - 73:48)
for this pokemon i figured it out (73:44 - 73:50)
um oh i figured it out earlier it was (73:48 - 73:52)
just execution of like i bet i have to (73:50 - 73:53)
light up these crystals and now if i (73:52 - 73:55)
light up these crystals (73:53 - 73:57)
that mythical is going to go from the (73:55 - 73:58)
second area to that final area where i'm (73:57 - 73:59)
gonna get the (73:58 - 74:03)
four star shot and i did that (73:59 - 74:06)
but they appeared way (74:03 - 74:10)
later than i expected them to appear so (74:06 - 74:12)
i wasn't ready and my back was turned to (74:10 - 74:14)
them so i i turned (74:12 - 74:16)
around i was there well i didn't know (74:14 - 74:17)
where they were going to appear (74:16 - 74:20)
right so now i have to go through an (74:17 - 74:22)
eighth level to do that and again i (74:20 - 74:23)
don't think it's (74:22 - 74:27)
hard it is time consuming (74:23 - 74:30)
and that that journey (74:27 - 74:35)
was fun um (74:30 - 74:35)
this is what we used to love about games (74:35 - 74:38)
yeah yeah (74:37 - 74:40)
nobody better turn over them to perfect (74:38 - 74:42)
them we didn't know there was a better (74:40 - 74:45)
life for us in the future we were dumb (74:42 - 74:48)
kids but i i think that i i think (74:45 - 74:50)
again this sounds like i'm complaining (74:48 - 74:51)
and it's not i think it's just talking (74:50 - 74:53)
about like this is the (74:51 - 74:55)
this is the end game like the end game (74:53 - 74:57)
is you're either you're either two types (74:55 - 74:58)
of player you're (74:57 - 75:00)
you're either one or or two or maybe (74:58 - 75:01)
you're a mix but you're either (75:00 - 75:03)
i'm going to just go to cerebe and i'm (75:01 - 75:05)
going to look up every interaction (75:03 - 75:07)
and then i'm going to execute or i'm (75:05 - 75:09)
going to be this player where i am going (75:07 - 75:10)
to do discovery (75:09 - 75:12)
and i'm going to just try to discover (75:10 - 75:13)
everything but i think a problem with (75:12 - 75:15)
that second player which i (75:13 - 75:17)
am right now the problem with that (75:15 - 75:19)
second player is (75:17 - 75:21)
there i don't think there is enough time (75:19 - 75:22)
in the in the (75:21 - 75:24)
in the week i don't think there's enough (75:22 - 75:27)
time in the month where you can (75:24 - 75:28)
do this and still have your sanity (75:27 - 75:30)
because if (75:28 - 75:31)
because i don't know if there is a (75:30 - 75:33)
single player out there (75:31 - 75:35)
in pokemon sword and shield that figured (75:33 - 75:37)
out yeah mask without somebody telling (75:35 - 75:38)
them (75:37 - 75:40)
or without going to serbia who figured (75:38 - 75:41)
out yeah mask (75:40 - 75:44)
how to evolve yeah mask into um not (75:41 - 75:45)
coffee regis (75:44 - 75:49)
uh into roone right without looking it (75:45 - 75:49)
up (75:49 - 75:51)
like there there has to be a certain (75:49 - 75:52)
point where you're going to start (75:51 - 75:53)
looking stuff up and i think that's okay (75:52 - 75:55)
i think that's totally fine (75:53 - 75:58)
um but i think that the (75:55 - 76:00)
if as long as you like that sense of as (75:58 - 76:02)
long as you're still having fun with the (76:00 - 76:04)
sense of discovery and as long as you're (76:02 - 76:06)
dedicated to trying to complete the (76:04 - 76:08)
pokedex (76:06 - 76:10)
i think you will really enjoy the post (76:08 - 76:13)
game i think most players and i think (76:10 - 76:15)
i think most players will probably get (76:13 - 76:16)
to credits (76:15 - 76:18)
they will probably try to beat some high (76:16 - 76:20)
scores they will probably try to finish (76:18 - 76:22)
their pokedex and they will move on (76:20 - 76:25)
and the reason i've i have established (76:22 - 76:26)
everything up to this point (76:25 - 76:29)
is because like every video game that (76:26 - 76:31)
comes out the conversation is always (76:29 - 76:34)
do you think there will be dlc uh and (76:31 - 76:37)
i just don't know if (76:34 - 76:40)
that is what one i don't think dlc is (76:37 - 76:41)
needed for every game (76:40 - 76:43)
two i'm not a hundred percent sure what (76:41 - 76:44)
dlc (76:43 - 76:49)
would be adding more violence (76:44 - 76:49)
uh because the thing about the more (76:49 - 76:53)
islands is they do (76:51 - 76:56)
such a good job in this game of making (76:53 - 76:58)
you go to an island and then making you (76:56 - 76:59)
come back to a different (76:58 - 77:01)
island where they added something new (76:59 - 77:03)
and then making you go back to that new (77:01 - 77:03)
aisle (77:03 - 77:05)
of that island you were just at again (77:03 - 77:06)
like at a certain point (77:05 - 77:09)
the game's like oh we opened up three (77:06 - 77:09)
spots (77:09 - 77:11)
pick which one you want to go to and (77:09 - 77:13)
you're kind of like it's it's like a (77:11 - 77:15)
good overwhelming feeling of like oh i (77:13 - 77:17)
got three spots to go to while i want to (77:15 - 77:17)
go (77:17 - 77:19)
i want to do this one once and now i (77:17 - 77:20)
want to go to this one but i'm going to (77:19 - 77:21)
do this one twice because it was so fun (77:20 - 77:24)
and then like when you get the credits (77:21 - 77:25)
they open up another (77:24 - 77:27)
area like the the amount of areas in (77:25 - 77:28)
this game is incredible this game is (77:27 - 77:30)
going to take me forever (77:28 - 77:33)
yeah like the first pokemon snap had six (77:30 - 77:34)
levels (77:33 - 77:36)
one version of each level i'm sorry (77:34 - 77:38)
maybe seven because the mew level (77:36 - 77:40)
um no alternate paths and you just did (77:38 - 77:43)
it this is like (77:40 - 77:46)
11 areas and every area has a day (77:43 - 77:50)
and a night or an evening and um there's (77:46 - 77:52)
like there's different routes like the (77:50 - 77:53)
game (77:52 - 77:57)
is a million percent to me worth the 60 (77:53 - 77:58)
dollars (77:57 - 78:01)
but as for the as for people being like (77:58 - 78:02)
is there going to be dlc (78:01 - 78:05)
i think the the thing that holds me up (78:02 - 78:05)
on this (78:05 - 78:07)
is it sure any game can have dlc but the (78:05 - 78:10)
thing i think holds me up is (78:07 - 78:14)
there is so much content here how can (78:10 - 78:16)
you even think about dlc (78:14 - 78:19)
yeah i mean that's not a difficult thing (78:16 - 78:21)
like there is so much content here and (78:19 - 78:22)
i'm enjoying it (78:21 - 78:24)
i can't wait to see if they have more i (78:22 - 78:25)
but i don't think most people are going (78:24 - 78:27)
to even come close to finishing it like (78:25 - 78:28)
think about you need (78:27 - 78:32)
you need 800 photos to complete this (78:28 - 78:35)
and well that's not even considering (78:32 - 78:38)
you need 4k (78:35 - 78:38)
i wouldn't people have gotten the (78:39 - 78:43)
credits and they have finished the game (78:41 - 78:47)
no all stars for all pokemon (78:43 - 78:50)
minimum because you don't need to fill (78:47 - 78:50)
out (78:50 - 78:54)
all four if you if you play 12 hours got (78:50 - 78:55)
two credits (78:54 - 78:57)
and then stop playing and go i wonder if (78:55 - 79:00)
there's going to be a dlc (78:57 - 79:02)
like what where where i i guess i i (79:00 - 79:04)
can't where's the disconnect like why (79:02 - 79:05)
are you not (79:04 - 79:07)
playing levels like or do you just want (79:05 - 79:08)
are you just looking for new maps and (79:07 - 79:10)
new pokemon like there's (79:08 - 79:13)
who knows ask them no i mean i do but (79:10 - 79:14)
like when you (79:13 - 79:16)
when you beat the game you're only at (79:14 - 79:18)
like (79:16 - 79:20)
140 pokemon like they're (79:18 - 79:23)
like i'm 40 hours in i'm still missing (79:20 - 79:25)
20 pokemon (79:23 - 79:27)
so if the if the drive is like i don't (79:25 - 79:28)
care about getting perfect score i just (79:27 - 79:30)
care about new pokemon (79:28 - 79:32)
like that there's no one is beating the (79:30 - 79:37)
game at 214 pokemon no one is doing that (79:32 - 79:40)
i mean people have (79:37 - 79:40)
no no you have to beat the game to get (79:40 - 79:44)
the mythicals to appear (79:42 - 79:48)
yeah so no one is getting credits (79:44 - 79:51)
and having a complete policy you have to (79:48 - 79:52)
get credits and then you have to go back (79:51 - 79:54)
and find another 40-some (79:52 - 79:58)
pokemon and i i we (79:54 - 79:59)
we know this we know that when people (79:58 - 80:01)
play video games not all people but the (79:59 - 80:03)
majority of people (80:01 - 80:05)
when they see credits they feel (80:03 - 80:06)
accomplished they feel done (80:05 - 80:09)
they move to a different game and that's (80:06 - 80:10)
fine that's normal (80:09 - 80:13)
like not every pokemon player in the (80:10 - 80:14)
world is a shiny hunter not every (80:13 - 80:16)
pokemon player in the world (80:14 - 80:17)
is going to grind the battle tower when (80:16 - 80:19)
they beat sword and shield (80:17 - 80:20)
they go through their journey they get (80:19 - 80:23)
their eight badges they see the credits (80:20 - 80:25)
and then they they hop back on fortnight (80:23 - 80:26)
um (80:25 - 80:28)
and they feel like that game is a valid (80:26 - 80:29)
60 (80:28 - 80:33)
of their time speaking of uh yeah my (80:29 - 80:34)
watch has now confirmed that we have (80:33 - 80:37)
discussed pokemon's news pokemon snap (80:34 - 80:38)
more than we talked about omega ruby and (80:37 - 80:41)
alpha sapphire (80:38 - 80:41)
i mean it's because i wasn't on the show (80:41 - 80:46)
i would talk about those two games (80:44 - 80:48)
forever (80:46 - 80:48)
in the sense of like (80:53 - 80:56)
i i just think that the game has so much (80:56 - 81:00)
content (80:58 - 81:03)
that most people and maybe i'm wrong (81:00 - 81:06)
most people will not seek out because (81:03 - 81:08)
they're just done with the game (81:06 - 81:11)
but for the people who want to try to (81:08 - 81:15)
get all 800 pictures or even (81:11 - 81:18)
take that further get all 800 pictures (81:15 - 81:21)
at 4k (81:18 - 81:21)
that is a long game and i think a (81:21 - 81:27)
very very small percentage of people are (81:24 - 81:28)
going to do (81:27 - 81:32)
that so i'm not seeing where the dlc (81:28 - 81:34)
fits in (81:32 - 81:36)
i just it's just i people who don't care (81:34 - 81:37)
about the getting (81:36 - 81:39)
all the diamonds but they just want more (81:37 - 81:41)
courses i mean i'm (81:39 - 81:43)
i'm still playing the game i'm st (81:41 - 81:45)
haven't gotten the completionist and i'm (81:43 - 81:47)
thinking oh if they could do dlc for (81:45 - 81:48)
this that would be fun (81:47 - 81:51)
it's having other other areas that i (81:48 - 81:52)
don't have to go through (81:51 - 81:55)
we need fourth or fifth or eighth time (81:52 - 81:58)
but do rosalia roserade level even if (81:55 - 82:00)
those are the only three pokemon (81:58 - 82:03)
in the entire level i'm there for it i'm (82:00 - 82:04)
paying a high (82:03 - 82:07)
medium yes like i don't (82:04 - 82:10)
i think you i think you think the desire (82:07 - 82:14)
for dlc is based out of boredom from the (82:10 - 82:15)
game and that is not (82:14 - 82:19)
often where dlc people's dlc wishes come (82:15 - 82:20)
from (82:19 - 82:22)
a lot of people's dlc wishes come from i (82:20 - 82:25)
really like this game i want more of it (82:22 - 82:27)
i have this package it would be great if (82:25 - 82:29)
there were also (82:27 - 82:31)
more islands that came later or more but (82:29 - 82:32)
i'm saying if (82:31 - 82:34)
if you're if your desire is i want more (82:32 - 82:35)
stuff i'm saying there is more stuff (82:34 - 82:38)
after the credits there's (82:35 - 82:40)
it's a different kind of stuff right (82:38 - 82:42)
because like with breath of the wild (82:40 - 82:45)
you could whatever defeat ganondorf or (82:42 - 82:45)
whatever (82:45 - 82:48)
and like not want to go and find all the (82:45 - 82:50)
cracker rocks (82:48 - 82:51)
but you'd still want dlc because you're (82:50 - 82:53)
just like i want more adventure (82:51 - 82:56)
right people want dlc for different (82:53 - 82:57)
reasons like yeah (82:56 - 82:58)
i still haven't gotten all of them i'm (82:57 - 83:00)
still going back to these courses and (82:58 - 83:01)
saying (83:00 - 83:03)
i want to see what's new here but i (83:01 - 83:05)
would also like a new course (83:03 - 83:08)
a new area a new library courses (83:05 - 83:10)
are being given to you after credits (83:08 - 83:12)
which i've been to (83:10 - 83:14)
i still want the dlc yeah even though (83:12 - 83:16)
they do those you still want more (83:14 - 83:16)
pokemon (83:16 - 83:19)
that the x version of this one place (83:16 - 83:21)
that i've been to is a new course (83:19 - 83:25)
it technically is but i it's not a new (83:21 - 83:26)
necessarily new biome (83:25 - 83:28)
completely new biomes don't open up (83:26 - 83:29)
there's not (83:28 - 83:32)
like a swamp area that has suddenly (83:29 - 83:34)
appeared in the middle of every (83:32 - 83:36)
everywhere they could do a swamp they (83:34 - 83:37)
could do a (83:36 - 83:40)
a perfect garden there are things in a (83:37 - 83:43)
dlc that i would want (83:40 - 83:45)
in addition to the already enjoyable (83:43 - 83:47)
experience i'm having with (83:45 - 83:49)
they could insert new pokemon into the (83:47 - 83:50)
existing (83:49 - 83:52)
pathways and that would i mean they (83:50 - 83:55)
could i i guess i'm just on the side (83:52 - 83:57)
that they made a complete game (83:55 - 84:00)
they did it is yes and that that (83:57 - 84:03)
more more of a good thing if you want (84:00 - 84:04)
more after the credits (84:03 - 84:06)
i am assuring people who maybe are on (84:04 - 84:07)
the fence that there is (84:06 - 84:11)
plenty to do after the credits (84:07 - 84:12)
that having more to do after the credit (84:11 - 84:14)
still doesn't negate (84:12 - 84:16)
a desire to have a dlc remember a new (84:14 - 84:17)
home (84:16 - 84:19)
that was a desire to have it did not (84:17 - 84:20)
need 18 sequels (84:19 - 84:24)
okay desire to have still money is for (84:20 - 84:26)
people that are like i want more (84:24 - 84:28)
yeah i want and there is more after the (84:26 - 84:29)
credits i (84:28 - 84:31)
still want more than i i know that (84:29 - 84:34)
there's a i know there's a cap of 214 (84:31 - 84:38)
i want 300. i want 500 (84:34 - 84:41)
i would like more added these two things (84:38 - 84:44)
aren't as polar opposite as you'd like (84:41 - 84:45)
to make them (84:44 - 84:48)
out i am enjoying it i feel like i feel (84:45 - 84:49)
like it's like these (84:48 - 84:50)
rounds it's like a green camera like (84:49 - 84:52)
it's like it's like the people that are (84:50 - 84:54)
like i want chinese in the game (84:52 - 84:55)
because and then the the only (84:54 - 84:57)
justification they could be like is (84:55 - 84:59)
i want chinese in the game and the only (84:57 - 85:00)
reason when you say why is because they (84:59 - 85:01)
go (85:00 - 85:03)
well i want more replayability like you (85:01 - 85:04)
what (85:03 - 85:06)
the only people that you're talking to (85:04 - 85:08)
let's talk about confirmation bias of (85:06 - 85:10)
the conversations you have (85:08 - 85:12)
there are a wide variety of people have (85:10 - 85:14)
them yes some people are like i want (85:12 - 85:16)
more replayability because (85:14 - 85:19)
they have done what they consider enough (85:16 - 85:20)
for the game they got (85:19 - 85:22)
four pictures of the quality that they (85:20 - 85:24)
care about and they would like to see (85:22 - 85:26)
something different that doesn't match (85:24 - 85:28)
up with what you think you want to get (85:26 - 85:29)
the 4ks (85:28 - 85:31)
it's important for you to have 4k (85:29 - 85:32)
pictures all four (85:31 - 85:34)
all perfectly done that's important to (85:32 - 85:36)
you that doesn't mean it's important to (85:34 - 85:37)
this other person (85:36 - 85:39)
it's definitely not as important to me i (85:37 - 85:41)
am not on a 4k hunt (85:39 - 85:44)
i would like to get four four pictures (85:41 - 85:44)
in each (85:44 - 85:46)
i don't care about the quality because (85:44 - 85:48)
the quality is already (85:46 - 85:51)
weirdly sp i don't agree with professor (85:48 - 85:52)
beer as it is (85:51 - 85:55)
he can he can just take his opinion and (85:52 - 85:56)
go elsewhere (85:55 - 86:01)
i i want to do these interactions (85:56 - 86:01)
i can still want more i can still say i (86:02 - 86:06)
really like this game and (86:05 - 86:09)
i would like more of it i would i would (86:06 - 86:11)
it's saying i would pay for a dlc (86:09 - 86:14)
because yes it's a complete game and if (86:11 - 86:16)
i never got a dlc i would be happy (86:14 - 86:20)
but i also wouldn't turn away from (86:16 - 86:23)
a dlc coming yeah i'm not saying i would (86:20 - 86:25)
put away from a dlc coming (86:23 - 86:27)
the thing that makes me happy in this (86:25 - 86:30)
game isn't even the taking the pictures (86:27 - 86:33)
it's seeing pokemon running around (86:30 - 86:35)
and making noises in a natural (86:33 - 86:36)
environment and (86:35 - 86:39)
you're like this is what the pokemon (86:36 - 86:41)
that's why i ride down these paths and (86:39 - 86:43)
try to unlock new pokemon and new things (86:41 - 86:46)
so i can see them running around and (86:43 - 86:47)
doing stuff (86:46 - 86:49)
the pictures are like yeah of course you (86:47 - 86:50)
have to do it or else you don't get to (86:49 - 86:52)
unlock the stuff yeah (86:50 - 86:54)
i would like to see more biomes i want (86:52 - 86:56)
to see more pokemon i would like to see (86:54 - 86:59)
more pokemon in their natural habitat (86:56 - 87:02)
sue me they gave me 214. i would like to (86:59 - 87:05)
see the natural biomes and activities (87:02 - 87:08)
of all nine hundred yes i think i am (87:05 - 87:10)
coming from a situ (87:08 - 87:13)
like you're saying (87:10 - 87:16)
that's what it is i think people want (87:13 - 87:16)
things (87:16 - 87:19)
i think people are greedy and they and (87:16 - 87:21)
they don't look for what's already there (87:19 - 87:22)
because maybe they can maybe they come (87:21 - 87:24)
off as lazy but (87:22 - 87:27)
uh or or or they just they they want a (87:24 - 87:29)
specific thing but in this sense (87:27 - 87:31)
you beat the game right you get credits (87:29 - 87:32)
however long that takes you eight hours (87:31 - 87:34)
12 hours 20 hours (87:32 - 87:36)
and there are still probably for most (87:34 - 87:37)
people (87:36 - 87:40)
50 plus pokemon to find um (87:37 - 87:42)
and some of those pokemon are locked (87:40 - 87:44)
behind beating the credits like the (87:42 - 87:45)
mythicals (87:44 - 87:48)
and let's say you don't care about (87:45 - 87:49)
getting all the pokemon (87:48 - 87:52)
well but you're asking for dlc well the (87:49 - 87:54)
dlc is adding more pokemon and (87:52 - 87:55)
for some reason you don't want to get (87:54 - 87:57)
the 50 that you're missing (87:55 - 87:59)
so that that that's the disconnect for (87:57 - 88:01)
me and i think that's a fair disconnect (87:59 - 88:03)
right like if if you're asking for dlc (88:01 - 88:04)
because you want more pokemon there (88:03 - 88:05)
definitely is more pokemon after the (88:04 - 88:05)
credits (88:05 - 88:07)
there is but not necessarily pokemon you (88:05 - 88:08)
care about yeah where's my (88:07 - 88:12)
term wait is it um that completes some (88:08 - 88:14)
of your disconnect there are pokemon (88:12 - 88:14)
that (88:14 - 88:16)
aren't in this game that i would like to (88:14 - 88:17)
see in this game (88:16 - 88:19)
i would like to see them in their (88:17 - 88:21)
natural habitat they aren't in the 50 (88:19 - 88:22)
that come after (88:21 - 88:24)
i don't care about the 50 that come (88:22 - 88:29)
after i care about the ones that i want (88:24 - 88:30)
the other thing is like if somebody's (88:29 - 88:32)
like well i'm looking for replayability (88:30 - 88:35)
and i want to play like in the case of (88:32 - 88:36)
like well i want chinese because i think (88:35 - 88:37)
chinese will add replayability (88:36 - 88:42)
um i i like the replayability is there (88:37 - 88:45)
you're just ignoring it like getting 800 (88:42 - 88:46)
photos (88:45 - 88:49)
of pokemon doing different things is a (88:46 - 88:50)
huge (88:49 - 88:52)
amount of replayability and i am (88:50 - 88:54)
confident that (88:52 - 88:57)
most people will not seek to get 800 (88:54 - 88:59)
photos it's a lot of work (88:57 - 89:03)
your version of replayability is (88:59 - 89:05)
completing this task no way there's (89:03 - 89:06)
other things no (89:05 - 89:07)
because you're not you're not listening (89:06 - 89:09)
i am making different things i am naming (89:07 - 89:10)
different things you can do after the (89:09 - 89:11)
credits (89:10 - 89:12)
you can complete your pokedex that's (89:11 - 89:14)
huge you can get 800 photos that's huge (89:12 - 89:16)
you can get 4k on a bunch of things (89:14 - 89:18)
that's huge you can get (89:16 - 89:20)
top course courages scores that's huge (89:18 - 89:22)
you can have the leaderboard that's huge (89:20 - 89:26)
that is so much from the game (89:22 - 89:28)
and my problem that my problem is (89:26 - 89:29)
there's so many things you can do (89:28 - 89:32)
and people jump to dlc right away and (89:29 - 89:33)
it's frustrating because they're (89:32 - 89:35)
ignoring all of that that exists (89:33 - 89:37)
right it's it's like when let's go (89:35 - 89:39)
pikachu let's go eevee came out (89:37 - 89:42)
and that day in my chat or the day on (89:39 - 89:44)
twitter or the day in slack people are (89:42 - 89:45)
like what's the next pokemon game (89:44 - 89:48)
yo this game just came out six hours ago (89:45 - 89:49)
and we're already looking at the next (89:48 - 89:50)
pokemon game (89:49 - 89:52)
i think sometimes the dlc conversation (89:50 - 89:54)
is frustrating because they're ignoring (89:52 - 89:55)
everything that is there and they're all (89:54 - 89:58)
they're already looking for the (89:55 - 90:00)
towards something for a nine-day old (89:58 - 90:01)
game (90:00 - 90:04)
like there is so much to do and i named (90:01 - 90:05)
five different things you can do after (90:04 - 90:06)
the credits so no (90:05 - 90:08)
it is not me hanging on the fact that i (90:06 - 90:10)
only care about 4k or i only care about (90:08 - 90:12)
the 800. i named a bunch of things that (90:10 - 90:12)
you can do (90:12 - 90:15)
this game i didn't say that that's what (90:12 - 90:16)
you're hanging on (90:15 - 90:19)
there is replayability your you what you (90:16 - 90:20)
say is repealability (90:19 - 90:22)
somebody may somebody else might not see (90:20 - 90:24)
it (90:22 - 90:26)
what you keep saying is the amount of (90:24 - 90:28)
time or they're looking ahead or people (90:26 - 90:29)
want the next thing people have always (90:28 - 90:31)
wanted the next thing because they get (90:29 - 90:32)
very excited about (90:31 - 90:36)
a product and they go out and are super (90:32 - 90:37)
excited about (90:36 - 90:40)
this was so great and wanting something (90:37 - 90:41)
to come (90:40 - 90:42)
what the next thing is wondering what (90:41 - 90:44)
the next thing is isn't (90:42 - 90:49)
a way of saying i'm done with this thing (90:44 - 90:52)
is that this thing excited me so much (90:49 - 90:54)
i'm excited for what else they can do (90:52 - 90:56)
and i'm expressing my desire to have (90:54 - 90:58)
more of it (90:56 - 91:00)
what i get frustrated you're saying is (90:58 - 91:02)
oh they're greedy or they're not (91:00 - 91:04)
appreciating what they want because what (91:02 - 91:04)
you're saying is (91:04 - 91:06)
by wanting something the next thing or (91:04 - 91:08)
being excited about the next thing or (91:06 - 91:10)
asking do you think they'll be just (91:08 - 91:12)
uh there'll be dlc and what you keep (91:10 - 91:14)
expressing is that is them (91:12 - 91:17)
saying this wasn't enough and i don't (91:14 - 91:19)
agree with that argument i think in a (91:17 - 91:21)
lot of for a lot of people it's saying (91:19 - 91:23)
this was so great and i'm very excited (91:21 - 91:25)
as to other things that can come and be (91:23 - 91:26)
added to this game (91:25 - 91:29)
i was so happy with sword and shield i (91:26 - 91:30)
am excited for what the next (91:29 - 91:33)
generation is i want to know what it is (91:30 - 91:34)
because (91:33 - 91:37)
this was such a fun experience i'm still (91:34 - 91:39)
playing this game i am still playing (91:37 - 91:41)
a lot of sword and shield i'm still (91:39 - 91:44)
doing a lot in there that doesn't stop (91:41 - 91:45)
me from thinking (91:44 - 91:47)
and wanting and being excited about what (91:45 - 91:49)
will they do next (91:47 - 91:52)
i think the death of a fandom the death (91:49 - 91:54)
of a game series is when people stop (91:52 - 91:57)
being excited about what will become (91:54 - 91:58)
next because the current thing (91:57 - 92:01)
failed so bad when people aren't saying (91:58 - 92:03)
what else are they going to do because (92:01 - 92:04)
this was so much fun (92:03 - 92:07)
and gave me so much joy when they stop (92:04 - 92:08)
thinking (92:07 - 92:11)
i don't care about what comes next your (92:08 - 92:11)
game (92:11 - 92:14)
and your franchise is dying because you (92:11 - 92:16)
no longer have excited people (92:14 - 92:19)
and i think where you come from is you (92:16 - 92:20)
have the same conversation (92:19 - 92:23)
a lot and it's frustrating because you (92:20 - 92:23)
are still (92:23 - 92:26)
enjoying this one thing and i would (92:23 - 92:28)
argue that people's excitement for the (92:26 - 92:29)
next thing (92:28 - 92:31)
is based from the excitement of the (92:29 - 92:32)
thing that they are playing (92:31 - 92:35)
and loving and are very into right now (92:32 - 92:38)
they aren't such desperate thoughts they (92:35 - 92:39)
aren't so (92:38 - 92:42)
away from each other because this thing (92:39 - 92:43)
enthused me (92:42 - 92:46)
about playing this game i want more (92:43 - 92:50)
i really love this and i want more (92:46 - 92:54)
i know that it takes seven months to get (92:50 - 92:57)
a dlc and i will tell you right now (92:54 - 92:59)
seven months from now i will be tired of (92:57 - 93:01)
running these courses (92:59 - 93:04)
i will be over doing all these things (93:01 - 93:07)
and i know that in seven months if a dlc (93:04 - 93:09)
came out and gave me new things it would (93:07 - 93:10)
pull me right back (93:09 - 93:12)
it's the same thing with animal crossing (93:10 - 93:13)
people knew the (93:12 - 93:15)
holidays were coming that didn't mean (93:13 - 93:17)
they hated what they were currently (93:15 - 93:17)
doing (93:17 - 93:19)
but they were excited to see what they (93:17 - 93:21)
were going to do with the upcoming (93:19 - 93:21)
holiday (93:21 - 93:24)
they were excited for that thing coming (93:21 - 93:26)
because they were excited by the product (93:24 - 93:29)
now this excites me i want (93:26 - 93:32)
more i can't wait to see what they do in (93:29 - 93:32)
the future (93:32 - 93:35)
this is not such a strange path and i (93:32 - 93:36)
don't think (93:35 - 93:39)
what often i think your argument is or (93:36 - 93:40)
what your feelings are (93:39 - 93:43)
is that they are somehow dissing or (93:40 - 93:44)
disliking (93:43 - 93:47)
or ragging on the current thing or (93:44 - 93:48)
saying it wasn't enough (93:47 - 93:50)
i don't think a lot of people are saying (93:48 - 93:53)
that it wasn't enough i'm saying that (93:50 - 93:54)
that a lot of people are very excited by (93:53 - 93:56)
what they got and (93:54 - 93:59)
are excited for more i would say yes to (93:56 - 94:00)
abbreviate what greg just said (93:59 - 94:03)
hope for the future is not reprobation (94:00 - 94:07)
of today i think what i don't express (94:03 - 94:11)
enough is that how wrong you are and how (94:07 - 94:14)
right me and greg are yes that's true (94:11 - 94:15)
that's why i bring up these harder (94:14 - 94:18)
conversations because you you guys (94:15 - 94:20)
never well that's not true never not (94:18 - 94:22)
agree you sometimes you guys agree with (94:20 - 94:23)
me sometimes you don't (94:22 - 94:25)
usually usually one of you two agree (94:23 - 94:27)
with me and then the other disagrees (94:25 - 94:28)
it's always like a two verse one on this (94:27 - 94:30)
show yeah um that's the way it goes but (94:28 - 94:31)
i (94:30 - 94:34)
i do admit that i always think logically (94:31 - 94:37)
so when when somebody says like oh i (94:34 - 94:39)
would like dlc for this game (94:37 - 94:42)
i'm not thinking of like so in that past (94:39 - 94:44)
argument i just had (94:42 - 94:46)
i'm thinking there is enough in this (94:44 - 94:47)
game (94:46 - 94:50)
already and most people won't experience (94:47 - 94:51)
that (94:50 - 94:55)
i want bandai namco to not work on dlc (94:51 - 94:57)
because i want them to work on another (94:55 - 95:00)
pokemon game that is (94:57 - 95:03)
yeah that is that is theoretically what (95:00 - 95:04)
i am thinking that next (95:03 - 95:07)
game is your dlc (95:04 - 95:10)
no it's what you wanting to know (95:07 - 95:13)
he wants them to work on a not snap yeah (95:10 - 95:15)
but you know i i think you can work in (95:13 - 95:15)
another game (95:15 - 95:18)
i know that game so so no it's more of (95:15 - 95:19)
like (95:18 - 95:23)
if they work on dlc i (95:19 - 95:25)
i i don't think it will sell as well as (95:23 - 95:26)
people give it credit for (95:25 - 95:29)
because uh because there's there's more (95:26 - 95:30)
than enough there (95:29 - 95:32)
and if if those people are not willing (95:30 - 95:34)
to do the more than enough there and i (95:32 - 95:35)
named the (95:34 - 95:36)
multiple things you can do after post (95:35 - 95:38)
game they're probably maybe not willing (95:36 - 95:40)
to get that dlc (95:38 - 95:42)
and so if they're going to spend seven (95:40 - 95:43)
months (95:42 - 95:46)
to sell a 10 dlc which is relatively (95:43 - 95:47)
short (95:46 - 95:49)
and not a lot of people will buy i'm (95:47 - 95:50)
just thinking like what if they spend (95:49 - 95:51)
that seven months on (95:50 - 95:58)
a pokemon ranger or a galaxy (95:51 - 95:58)
and i feel like sometimes that gets lost (95:58 - 96:01)
where like when people are like i want (96:00 - 96:03)
dlc i'm more i'm more thinking like (96:01 - 96:05)
we have a complete game right here i've (96:03 - 96:06)
got it and what if what if bandai and (96:05 - 96:08)
namco worked on just a different game (96:06 - 96:09)
that we could get but you're you're (96:08 - 96:10)
talking about (96:09 - 96:12)
bandai namco can only do one thing at a (96:10 - 96:14)
time and you're also ignoring from a (96:12 - 96:15)
company (96:14 - 96:17)
what return on investment is a company (96:15 - 96:19)
who can put out (96:17 - 96:21)
an additional to a project that of an (96:19 - 96:22)
already established (96:21 - 96:25)
built game they don't have to build it (96:22 - 96:25)
from scratch (96:25 - 96:27)
the turnaround time of building more (96:25 - 96:29)
levels on an already existing channel (96:27 - 96:33)
a game and set of rules and guidance and (96:29 - 96:37)
art that takes way less time so there's (96:33 - 96:39)
an investment of a team working on (96:37 - 96:41)
something for four months (96:39 - 96:43)
they may sell it for ten dollars and get (96:41 - 96:44)
half the sales (96:43 - 96:46)
but the amount of time that they spent (96:44 - 96:47)
making on it plus the amount of profit (96:46 - 96:48)
they get (96:47 - 96:50)
is well worth making that dlc that's not (96:48 - 96:52)
necessarily true otherwise every game (96:50 - 96:53)
won't have dlc (96:52 - 96:55)
i'm not saying it's necessarily true for (96:53 - 96:57)
every game that is a that is a decision (96:55 - 96:58)
that companies make (96:57 - 97:01)
where but to say that it to say that (96:58 - 97:02)
they're going to take resources from (97:01 - 97:04)
making a brand new game away (97:02 - 97:06)
from if they can determine that the (97:04 - 97:09)
return of event is great for a dlc (97:06 - 97:10)
they're gonna make the return on (97:09 - 97:12)
investment thing that makes them the (97:10 - 97:12)
most money (97:12 - 97:14)
and if that's a dlc they'll do it (97:12 - 97:16)
because it makes sense (97:14 - 97:18)
it is easy to add on to an existing (97:16 - 97:20)
property for some things especially (97:18 - 97:23)
if in this new world most (97:20 - 97:26)
companies are aware that dlc sells and (97:23 - 97:26)
they will (97:26 - 97:29)
build things into their game to be able (97:26 - 97:30)
to add onto the game later (97:29 - 97:32)
like that is part of a new development (97:30 - 97:35)
cycle for video games so (97:32 - 97:38)
i don't agree with the idea that working (97:35 - 97:39)
on a dlc (97:38 - 97:42)
means something else is pushed down the (97:39 - 97:43)
line that is a (97:42 - 97:45)
internal company decision and they would (97:43 - 97:47)
have already made those plans (97:45 - 97:50)
basically but i don't agree that like (97:47 - 97:52)
working on a dlc is going to get their (97:50 - 97:54)
money back or is worth the seven months (97:52 - 97:55)
or is worth like (97:54 - 97:57)
the investment but we don't see their (97:55 - 97:59)
profits right we don't know what their (97:57 - 98:00)
return on investment is (97:59 - 98:02)
but there are plenty of popular games (98:00 - 98:05)
like final fantasy series (98:02 - 98:08)
and final fantasy 15 had plenty of dlc (98:05 - 98:09)
we know that game sold incredibly well (98:08 - 98:11)
and they canceled the deal they (98:09 - 98:12)
cancelled after two dlcs like they were (98:11 - 98:14)
supposed to have four and they only did (98:12 - 98:14)
two (98:14 - 98:17)
and so like in that situation we know (98:14 - 98:18)
that square enix is incredibly (98:17 - 98:21)
successful we knew that final fantasy 15 (98:18 - 98:24)
sold incredibly well um and like (98:21 - 98:27)
and the dlc maybe didn't sell that well (98:24 - 98:28)
so they canceled the other two dlc (98:27 - 98:30)
right they did that was a return to (98:28 - 98:32)
investment but the projection for return (98:30 - 98:32)
on investment (98:32 - 98:34)
based off of sales was these were going (98:32 - 98:36)
to be great and (98:34 - 98:38)
they started on that path and when the (98:36 - 98:39)
return on investment (98:38 - 98:41)
when they realized that they were (98:39 - 98:43)
putting more resources towards something (98:41 - 98:45)
that wasn't returning the profit that (98:43 - 98:46)
they had expected (98:45 - 98:49)
but again they built final fantasy 15 to (98:46 - 98:49)
be (98:49 - 98:53)
able to have dlc and they (98:49 - 98:56)
that didn't stop them from from making (98:53 - 98:58)
two more expansions and patches to final (98:56 - 98:59)
fantasy xiv (98:58 - 99:01)
it didn't stop them from making a ton of (98:59 - 99:02)
other games they had (99:01 - 99:05)
resources set aside saying hey if this (99:02 - 99:07)
sells this is our return on investment (99:05 - 99:09)
on something that is easier to make (99:07 - 99:10)
i don't know about final fantasy 15 that (99:09 - 99:12)
game was in development wait wait wait (99:10 - 99:14)
let me let me see if i can put this into (99:12 - 99:16)
terms that are (99:14 - 99:21)
less uh final fantasy oriented listeners (99:16 - 99:24)
so we're okay here it's an analogy (99:21 - 99:27)
right oh god so we're eating a delicious (99:24 - 99:28)
cupcake (99:27 - 99:32)
pokemon snap delicious vanilla cupcake (99:28 - 99:36)
with frosting and greg is saying (99:32 - 99:38)
i'm halfway done eating this delicious (99:36 - 99:39)
vanilla frost (99:38 - 99:42)
cupcake with frosting please baker make (99:39 - 99:43)
me (99:42 - 99:46)
another cupcake same vanilla cupcake it (99:43 - 99:47)
was delicious (99:46 - 99:50)
let's put some sprinkles on it all right (99:47 - 99:52)
and i will be happy (99:50 - 99:55)
if you do that for steve is saying (99:52 - 99:57)
i am going to eat this entire vanilla (99:55 - 99:58)
cupcake (99:57 - 100:00)
and in the time because greg's not going (99:58 - 100:01)
to finish the first one he's (100:00 - 100:03)
you know he'll get as much through it (100:01 - 100:04)
but he's going to once he sees the (100:03 - 100:06)
sprinkles he's going to jump on that (100:04 - 100:08)
steve is saying i'm going to take the (100:06 - 100:10)
time and i'm going to eat this entire (100:08 - 100:12)
vanilla cupcake and while i am doing (100:10 - 100:13)
that (100:12 - 100:16)
baker you are so good this vanilla (100:13 - 100:17)
cupcake was so great (100:16 - 100:20)
please make me a chocolate cupcake and i (100:17 - 100:21)
will (100:20 - 100:23)
attempt to enjoy i will take the risk (100:21 - 100:24)
now (100:23 - 100:27)
all of the risk is on the baker right (100:24 - 100:29)
because (100:27 - 100:32)
the baker can only make so many cupcakes (100:29 - 100:34)
at a time maybe they can make another (100:32 - 100:35)
vanilla cupcake because they've already (100:34 - 100:37)
got the recipe and toss some sprinkles (100:35 - 100:39)
on it (100:37 - 100:41)
right or maybe they can only do a (100:39 - 100:43)
chocolate cupcake (100:41 - 100:46)
maybe they can do both we'll see fi both (100:43 - 100:49)
we'll see in time but the thing to (100:46 - 100:50)
remember (100:49 - 100:52)
you both enjoyed the original vanilla (100:50 - 100:54)
cupcakes yeah that's never been in (100:52 - 100:54)
question (100:54 - 100:57)
what you want for the future it's your (100:54 - 100:59)
perspective of what you want for the (100:57 - 101:01)
future but it doesn't take away (100:59 - 101:04)
from what you originally were eating and (101:01 - 101:05)
enjoyed (101:04 - 101:07)
in your own way of eating it and (101:05 - 101:08)
enjoying some people don't even like (101:07 - 101:09)
frosting (101:08 - 101:10)
they only eat the cake and they toss the (101:09 - 101:12)
frosting aside and yet that cupcake was (101:10 - 101:14)
just as good for that (101:12 - 101:18)
i live with that person i will say i i (101:14 - 101:18)
have never (101:18 - 101:22)
cited on loving dlc and (101:18 - 101:23)
either there there's a lot of people (101:22 - 101:26)
that there are there are people that (101:23 - 101:28)
agree with me in the sense of like (101:26 - 101:30)
you you see the complaints of like oh (101:28 - 101:32)
this is probably cut from the game so (101:30 - 101:36)
they can sell it for dlc or or whatnot (101:32 - 101:39)
or this dlc wasn't nearly as good as the (101:36 - 101:40)
main game (101:39 - 101:43)
or um they do like and this is the (101:40 - 101:44)
industry they do this thing where they (101:43 - 101:45)
like (101:44 - 101:47)
sell you the game for 80 because you're (101:45 - 101:49)
going to get the dlc at a later date (101:47 - 101:51)
final fantasy 15 was a game that did (101:49 - 101:52)
this you could either buy the 60 (101:51 - 101:54)
game or the 80 game and get the four (101:52 - 101:55)
promised dlcs but there wasn't four (101:54 - 101:56)
there was only two (101:55 - 101:59)
um and i have never been that person (101:56 - 101:59)
right (101:59 - 102:02)
i have never been the person that says i (101:59 - 102:03)
want the collector's edition with all (102:02 - 102:05)
the dlc (102:03 - 102:08)
because even though i'm saving 10 bucks (102:05 - 102:08)
or whatever (102:08 - 102:11)
i don't know if i'm going to get there i (102:08 - 102:12)
don't know if i'm even going to (102:11 - 102:14)
finish the base game why would i buy (102:12 - 102:15)
content (102:14 - 102:17)
that one doesn't exist yet and two i (102:15 - 102:19)
don't even know if i'm gonna enjoy (102:17 - 102:22)
so in the sense of that (102:19 - 102:24)
i have always just bought the base game (102:22 - 102:26)
and if i liked it enough (102:24 - 102:30)
and i wanted more than the dlc is there (102:26 - 102:33)
but also i have felt that the dlc (102:30 - 102:36)
that i've gotten is really never as good (102:33 - 102:38)
as the main game and kind of mostly (102:36 - 102:40)
disappointing like i kind of thought (102:38 - 102:42)
that the dlc to fallout 3 was not great (102:40 - 102:44)
and the dlc to fall out (102:42 - 102:47)
new vegas also like and didn't look (102:44 - 102:48)
appealing to me (102:47 - 102:49)
and that's totally a choice right like (102:48 - 102:51)
there are some people who love fallout (102:49 - 102:51)
and (102:51 - 102:54)
love the dlc and stuff um (102:51 - 102:57)
how did you feel about crown tundra and (102:54 - 102:58)
isle of armor (102:57 - 103:01)
i thought that was i i that dlc blew my (102:58 - 103:03)
expectations away honestly (103:01 - 103:05)
um like they were they were definitely (103:03 - 103:07)
there were definitely expectations (103:05 - 103:10)
and the dlc that i've had i'm the person (103:07 - 103:11)
that will (103:10 - 103:14)
if it's a series that i absolutely adore (103:11 - 103:16)
and i know that i (103:14 - 103:19)
more often that 90 percent (103:16 - 103:21)
i will love the experience that they (103:19 - 103:23)
show me i will buy everything up front (103:21 - 103:26)
because i know that i will (103:23 - 103:29)
have it when i want to get to it and i i (103:26 - 103:30)
am (103:29 - 103:32)
banking on my past experiences with the (103:30 - 103:33)
series to say (103:32 - 103:36)
this is good enough to buy now at the (103:33 - 103:38)
very least you know you're going to want (103:36 - 103:39)
to touch it (103:38 - 103:40)
right i'm going to want to touch it now (103:39 - 103:42)
we can it's a separate conversation (103:40 - 103:45)
about businesses putting out half-baked (103:42 - 103:46)
games with dlc like (103:45 - 103:49)
there is there is a crappy level (103:46 - 103:52)
of of pressure and game design that (103:49 - 103:53)
exists (103:52 - 103:55)
about like and that's a completely (103:53 - 103:57)
separate conversation that i don't think (103:55 - 103:58)
applies to snap (103:57 - 104:01)
and i i do want to stress that like some (103:58 - 104:03)
games do feel half-baked and then (104:01 - 104:04)
like a lot of people thought that for (104:03 - 104:06)
sword and shield and they thought that (104:04 - 104:07)
the dlc maybe should have been included (104:06 - 104:08)
i just (104:07 - 104:10)
want to stress that i think pokemon snap (104:08 - 104:12)
is a full 60 (104:10 - 104:15)
a million things to do kind of game so (104:12 - 104:17)
i think it's a separate conversation to (104:15 - 104:19)
have about the state of the industry (104:17 - 104:22)
and dlc as a completion to a game or (104:19 - 104:23)
putting out half (104:22 - 104:25)
half done games knowing that dlc will (104:23 - 104:27)
come later like (104:25 - 104:30)
that whole conversation is is a very (104:27 - 104:32)
complicated situation that i don't think (104:30 - 104:35)
is we don't have the time or expertise (104:32 - 104:36)
to do right now (104:35 - 104:41)
but i don't think i think (104:36 - 104:43)
you need to learn how a company (104:41 - 104:45)
approaches dlc (104:43 - 104:48)
to know how they approach making games (104:45 - 104:48)
and i (104:48 - 104:51)
think when you see a company that starts (104:48 - 104:53)
to feel like they are short (104:51 - 104:56)
shorting their a game to go out to do (104:53 - 105:00)
dlc later that you should re-evaluate to (104:56 - 105:02)
that game (105:00 - 105:04)
i think that's a different conversation (105:02 - 105:07)
than what we're having here yeah (105:04 - 105:09)
i mean if we want to look at bandai (105:07 - 105:11)
namco's dlc for pokken tournament it (105:09 - 105:12)
wasn't (105:11 - 105:15)
great it was real bad honestly yeah but (105:12 - 105:16)
twenty dollars for two characters i (105:15 - 105:18)
would also argue that (105:16 - 105:20)
falcon tournament wasn't great when it (105:18 - 105:21)
came out like you either really really (105:20 - 105:23)
loved it or you got what you're gonna (105:21 - 105:24)
get out of it and you were never gonna (105:23 - 105:26)
go back for those additional characters (105:24 - 105:31)
and their dlc was aimed towards (105:26 - 105:32)
the people who absolutely allure that (105:31 - 105:34)
loved that game and they went in (105:32 - 105:38)
knowing what the over (105:34 - 105:41)
under of doing that like we can't see (105:38 - 105:42)
their internals (105:41 - 105:45)
but working in a massive company (105:42 - 105:47)
they have done the calculations about (105:45 - 105:49)
how much they're going to invest (105:47 - 105:50)
and that run the numbers about how much (105:49 - 105:52)
they expect to get back (105:50 - 105:53)
i should say that like balancing two (105:52 - 105:55)
characters in a fight a game is (105:53 - 105:57)
it's complicated very complicated to (105:55 - 105:58)
make sure that that feels good and they (105:57 - 106:00)
fit with the other roster that exists (105:58 - 106:01)
and they don't overlap into potential (106:00 - 106:03)
but stuff like there's a stuff (106:01 - 106:05)
but every there is not a single large (106:03 - 106:07)
corporation in the world that doesn't (106:05 - 106:09)
look at the resources they have (106:07 - 106:11)
do the forecasting of the return that (106:09 - 106:12)
they're supposed to get back (106:11 - 106:15)
and make that call to say yes pull the (106:12 - 106:16)
trigger (106:15 - 106:21)
no don't right and i i would be (106:16 - 106:24)
shocked if snap didn't sell incredibly (106:21 - 106:25)
well (106:24 - 106:27)
and i would be even more shocked if they (106:25 - 106:29)
didn't have a conversation about dlc (106:27 - 106:31)
absolutely did they absolutely did but (106:29 - 106:33)
again we can see that in cases of final (106:31 - 106:34)
fantasy 15 (106:33 - 106:39)
where most likely purchases of the dlc (106:34 - 106:43)
were underperforming and so they stopped (106:39 - 106:46)
like they had a forecast they had a a (106:43 - 106:47)
window that they said this (106:46 - 106:50)
is acceptable and when it fell below (106:47 - 106:53)
they stopped like that is how companies (106:50 - 106:54)
work (106:53 - 106:56)
and there have been situations in (106:54 - 106:58)
pokemon where it seemed like there (106:56 - 106:59)
should have been as (106:58 - 107:02)
maybe a pokemon z yeah and where did it (106:59 - 107:04)
go (107:02 - 107:06)
they didn't do it probably development (107:04 - 107:08)
who knows what happened (107:06 - 107:12)
and it's hard to say in the new new (107:08 - 107:14)
world that we're in (107:12 - 107:17)
because nothing is gotten back to normal (107:14 - 107:18)
business practices (107:17 - 107:22)
so we don't know if you know the team (107:18 - 107:23)
that made snap (107:22 - 107:24)
may be able to work in the office and (107:23 - 107:26)
they have all made arrangements to keep (107:24 - 107:27)
going (107:26 - 107:29)
and a team to do new things is still (107:27 - 107:30)
scattered to the winds (107:29 - 107:32)
and so they're like well let's get a (107:30 - 107:33)
quick good hit out (107:32 - 107:36)
because we have this team built we don't (107:33 - 107:37)
have to restructure and they can all (107:36 - 107:39)
work in one location (107:37 - 107:41)
like there are a lot of factors that go (107:39 - 107:43)
into it that we just can't see right now (107:41 - 107:44)
but we are in (107:43 - 107:51)
an unusual work situation (107:44 - 107:55)
anyway what's next one of the week (107:51 - 107:58)
all right boy so last week's pokemon (107:55 - 108:01)
i forgot to write down so once again i (107:58 - 108:02)
remember (108:01 - 108:04)
i just i get to say the bad one then (108:02 - 108:06)
because i didn't write it down (108:04 - 108:08)
i gotta i gotta hear it but i i think i (108:06 - 108:10)
knew what it was (108:08 - 108:12)
i'll just read it again because i (108:10 - 108:14)
literally (108:12 - 108:17)
gave it away in the fourth (108:14 - 108:21)
not word but whatever of the clue (108:17 - 108:24)
out of my 659 instagram followers one (108:21 - 108:26)
recently commissioned a digital piece (108:24 - 108:29)
art piece by calgarian corsola of (108:26 - 108:31)
themselves as a pokemon gym leader in (108:29 - 108:32)
snow point city (108:31 - 108:34)
even though the current snow point gym (108:32 - 108:36)
leader is ice type the picture depicts (108:34 - 108:37)
my follower as (108:36 - 108:39)
a normal type gym leader this week's (108:37 - 108:42)
pokemon is not featured in that drawing (108:39 - 108:44)
this week's pokemon is one of the first (108:42 - 108:46)
three pokemon to appear when you begin (108:44 - 108:48)
playing the new pokemon snap (108:46 - 108:50)
and the only one that has not been (108:48 - 108:53)
featured as a starter in any pokemon (108:50 - 108:53)
game (108:53 - 108:56)
it is possible that this week's pokemon (108:53 - 108:58)
was excluded from the new snowpoint city (108:56 - 109:00)
gym because its evolution is actually (108:58 - 109:03)
weak to ice type attacks (109:00 - 109:03)
who is it it's (109:04 - 109:11)
cathode i get the civilian what (109:08 - 109:15)
no i actually think i remember (109:11 - 109:16)
i want to say it's unpheasant but i (109:15 - 109:19)
don't remember if unfuzzy doesn't appear (109:16 - 109:23)
in the in the park literally the first (109:19 - 109:27)
second of pokemon snap (109:23 - 109:31)
no it is an eevee and a pikachu (109:27 - 109:33)
with a bunnelby standing watching the (109:31 - 109:36)
eevee and the pikachu running around (109:33 - 109:38)
oh you're not talking about park you're (109:36 - 109:40)
talking about like the (109:38 - 109:44)
i said pokemon (109:40 - 109:44)
one of the first three pokemon to appear (109:46 - 109:49)
when you begin (109:48 - 109:53)
playing the new photo you turn it on (109:49 - 109:55)
you're walking up to the lab i thought (109:53 - 109:56)
you were saying (109:55 - 109:58)
the first like level level but when (109:56 - 109:59)
you're part of the picture (109:58 - 110:01)
unpheasant flies over to be fair (109:59 - 110:03)
unpleasant flies (110:01 - 110:07)
is already weak to ice number two (110:03 - 110:12)
i do not have 659 instagram followers (110:07 - 110:15)
yeah you do no i don't i at the time of (110:12 - 110:18)
that writing i had 651 today i have 652 (110:15 - 110:22)
either way 659 is pokedex (110:18 - 110:25)
okay got it got it got it i always (110:22 - 110:27)
forget bundle b is ground (110:25 - 110:30)
that's what it's not gross bumblebee is (110:27 - 110:30)
normal (110:30 - 110:34)
that's what it's diggersb (110:30 - 110:34)
but you said weak to ice it's evolution (110:35 - 110:41)
is weak to ice i don't really listen on (110:38 - 110:43)
this podcast (110:41 - 110:45)
why do i do it here we don't know why (110:43 - 110:47)
you do it i gave you 8 (110:45 - 110:50)
000 different you could literally go on (110:47 - 110:52)
youtube and watch a video of like here's (110:50 - 110:54)
where pokemon snap starts and (110:52 - 110:58)
bunnelby's hanging out right there oh oh (110:54 - 110:59)
either way all right well then you're (110:58 - 111:02)
done you're over it (110:59 - 111:07)
this week's is going to be worse (111:02 - 111:09)
but we didn't get any trivia though hold (111:07 - 111:10)
on okay go for it go for it (111:09 - 111:13)
i don't have any there's nothing (111:10 - 111:16)
uh was it in shuffle it had to have been (111:13 - 111:18)
shuffled yeah yeah everything (111:16 - 111:22)
pre-gen 8 was in shuffle it's so cute (111:18 - 111:25)
but it's got real tiny ears it's very (111:22 - 111:26)
cute (111:25 - 111:28)
is the shiny at all different oh it's (111:26 - 111:29)
got white yeah it's (111:28 - 111:32)
it has white and red eyes which i think (111:29 - 111:34)
is like a different i think it's a (111:32 - 111:36)
reference to a different kind of (111:34 - 111:38)
out the most important piece of trivia (111:36 - 111:41)
written in bulbapedia (111:38 - 111:45)
bundle b seems to be based on a rabbit (111:41 - 111:45)
i have so many rabbits in my backyard i (111:46 - 111:49)
don't know if i should be worried (111:47 - 111:51)
we do we do do this time to time bundle (111:49 - 111:53)
b is designed by (111:51 - 111:56)
a korean (111:53 - 112:00)
designer which is huge for pokemon uh (111:56 - 112:00)
the (112:00 - 112:03)
the lee (112:00 - 112:03)
we'll go with lee for now uh (112:06 - 112:13)
they made ted pig pig knight embar (112:09 - 112:14)
and bundle bees so those are the four (112:13 - 112:16)
pokemon lee had made (112:14 - 112:20)
which is cool (112:16 - 112:20)
they didn't make diggers be though so (112:20 - 112:23)
i'm not sure who the the artist for that (112:21 - 112:24)
is but (112:23 - 112:26)
how weird does that have to be that you (112:24 - 112:28)
work on the evolution and somebody else (112:26 - 112:31)
works on the other yeah like i can't (112:28 - 112:33)
imagine what those meetings are like (112:31 - 112:36)
well james turner said that they when (112:33 - 112:37)
they make a pokemon they don't even get (112:36 - 112:38)
to make the lore of it (112:37 - 112:41)
somebody else does that this is gonna be (112:38 - 112:43)
the weird (112:41 - 112:46)
i would be so weird about i want control (112:43 - 112:48)
this is my precious baby line and don't (112:46 - 112:49)
you mess it up by telling (112:48 - 112:51)
telling people that it eats children or (112:49 - 112:55)
lures them into swamps (112:51 - 112:55)
yeah huh all right are you ready for (112:56 - 113:00)
this week's (112:59 - 113:04)
i'm ready this week is more of a riddle (113:00 - 113:06)
that may prove difficult for our (113:04 - 113:07)
international listeners (113:06 - 113:11)
but even so there may be a home for them (113:07 - 113:12)
whenever my friend chris and i get (113:11 - 113:15)
together we always eat at a particular (113:12 - 113:18)
24-hour breakfast themed restaurant (113:15 - 113:21)
we enjoy this restaurant so much in fact (113:18 - 113:22)
we have discussed getting matching (113:21 - 113:23)
tattoos (113:22 - 113:26)
featuring the restaurant's iconic font (113:23 - 113:27)
unfortunately (113:26 - 113:29)
this restaurant does not have branches (113:27 - 113:30)
in the dakotas (113:29 - 113:34)
minnesota iowa or wisconsin (113:30 - 113:37)
the closest i could find being down i-35 (113:34 - 113:39)
in kansas city missouri about a six-hour (113:37 - 113:41)
drive away (113:39 - 113:43)
it is not the restaurant referenced in (113:41 - 113:44)
the first sentence of this riddle which (113:43 - 113:46)
does have a branch located about three (113:44 - 113:48)
miles from my home (113:46 - 113:50)
if you wish to obtain the name of this (113:48 - 113:51)
week's fruit based pokemon (113:50 - 113:53)
you will focus on the first word in the (113:51 - 113:55)
name of the restaurant i frequent with (113:53 - 113:56)
chris (113:55 - 113:58)
there are two letters that repeat in (113:56 - 114:01)
that word you will need to substitute (113:58 - 114:01)
them (114:01 - 114:04)
for another letter the first letter of (114:01 - 114:04)
the word (114:04 - 114:07)
though a single letter is technically (114:04 - 114:08)
also a double letter (114:07 - 114:11)
so you will replace it with two letters (114:08 - 114:12)
the first one (114:11 - 114:14)
the first is one of the letters you have (114:12 - 114:15)
already replaced (114:14 - 114:18)
the second is the second to last letter (114:15 - 114:19)
of the word (114:18 - 114:21)
the second and second to last letters (114:19 - 114:23)
are now the same (114:21 - 114:25)
i do not believe the applicable fruit is (114:23 - 114:27)
available on this restaurant's menu (114:25 - 114:30)
i may be wrong (114:27 - 114:30)
this might be your hardest one i blanked (114:31 - 114:35)
out halfway through now it's so easy (114:33 - 114:36)
it's so (114:35 - 114:39)
easy (114:36 - 114:39)
all right well we will be back next week (114:40 - 114:45)
thank you for listening (114:43 - 114:48)
there there was a when i was one earlier (114:45 - 114:49)
in the episode when greg and i were (114:48 - 114:51)
disagreeing on things there was a (114:49 - 114:52)
comment that came (114:51 - 114:54)
of like was it a i think it was an (114:52 - 114:56)
itunes review (114:54 - 114:57)
that said i don't know if these guys (114:56 - 115:00)
like each other yeah people think (114:57 - 115:01)
let it be known that even though greg (115:00 - 115:03)
and i (115:01 - 115:06)
very much disagree uh on a lot of video (115:03 - 115:07)
game stuff (115:06 - 115:09)
i respect the heck out of greg's (115:07 - 115:10)
opinions (115:09 - 115:12)
and i think they're very insightful and (115:10 - 115:13)
very good (115:12 - 115:18)
i had a person dm me on twitter who is (115:13 - 115:19)
like (115:18 - 115:23)
how can you do a show every week when (115:19 - 115:24)
you hate steve (115:23 - 115:29)
so much and i'm like what (115:24 - 115:29)
i don't i (115:29 - 115:33)
i don't hate steve i just think (115:33 - 115:39)
he's wrong in every aspect of his life i (115:37 - 115:41)
still like the dude yeah (115:39 - 115:44)
guys like the dude a lot yeah there's a (115:41 - 115:46)
lot of people who think that (115:44 - 115:49)
we hate each other i i i think that the (115:46 - 115:50)
show (115:49 - 115:52)
the problem is there's been instances (115:50 - 115:54)
where we've all agreed on something (115:52 - 115:56)
yeah and then people yell at us yeah (115:54 - 115:57)
well they're like (115:56 - 115:59)
it's boring again nobody's happy with (115:57 - 116:00)
anything right (115:59 - 116:02)
anymore so i i definitely i definitely (116:00 - 116:03)
am very strongly (116:02 - 116:05)
opinionated on how i feel about games (116:03 - 116:07)
and game development and i (116:05 - 116:09)
talk pokemon a lot and i think i think (116:07 - 116:11)
greg and both will are very insightful (116:09 - 116:13)
in what they say and i'm glad that (116:11 - 116:16)
i'm very glad that they don't agree with (116:13 - 116:17)
me on (116:16 - 116:18)
ninety percent of the things i say (116:17 - 116:20)
otherwise this would be a very boring (116:18 - 116:21)
podcast as i said to many people (116:20 - 116:24)
steve would be a lot smarter if he just (116:21 - 116:26)
agreed with me (116:24 - 116:28)
but but right we obviously we come from (116:26 - 116:30)
very different backgrounds i (116:28 - 116:33)
have studied uh (116:30 - 116:36)
