[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 450 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host spj with me is greg hello happy discounted chocolate day it's the best day it's monday all the chocolate goes on discount i need to make a trip to target to get my discounted chocolate yeah strawberry uh jellybean straw straw star bursts not strawberries well star burst jelly beans those are good they're good i think the jolly rancher jelly beans are better no people have had those jelly belly jelly beans oh we have well we have a whole bunch of jelly belly jelly beans because we had a giant container at the costco because they didn't have a giant container of twizzlers so instead we got a giant container of uh jelly bellies choices we have to make in life true but there are so many flavors of jelly belly that i don't like that i just like my husband just grabs a handful and just eats whatever and i think that's madness well i'm i'm more in your husband's line but you are aware that if you shop at places other than costco you can actually buy single flavor bags of jelly belly jelly beans and then mix and match for whatever taste sensation you would like to create for your handful of jelly beans nobody does that that's madness will is there yeah i still don't have a house it is so weird to me i am like literally like running around the streets of minneapolis with money in my hands like take my money take my money please let me have a house and i have seen places with you i know that looked at places that was not that place was not not cutting the not making the grade there no i mean price was right price right if i wanted to have my bedroom in the living room because i can't fit an actual bed in the bedroom yes the bedrooms are a little odd my super large size love sack would take up the entirety of one of those rooms you're gonna lived in the basement the basement was nice i feel like greg in another life is like a real estate agent and you know greg's mom is a real estate agent so every house we see greg is like sees the positive in it okay so i i have never rented a house before right and this is literally my first time renting this part well whatever that whole concept of the house doesn't come with a washer and dryer you can bring your own or grab one from us i'm like no no that was bad a little bit we walked in i had a lot of i had a lot of okay this could be nice until we walked into the bedrooms of that place and i was like oh no yes no this is not this is not an actual house these are after well it was a house in like the 1850s when people were about two feet shorter than they currently are and they lived in smaller homes correct and it had a nice sized bathroom at the sake of everything bedroom yes what are you doing well speaking of afterthoughts uh this is the 25th anniversary of pokemon yeah and there's not right now a lot of pokemon news but we do have some we always have some luck when i say there's not a lot of pokemon news i mean we got a two-hour show instead of a five-hour show yes i mean if there's even on the least pokemon news week of the year we can dig up something even if we have to go out and make it ourselves remember uh sbj has gone to articles from the past i haven't brought them back forward so there is nothing there is nothing off the table i'm half expecting him to say well i expect this article to be written at some point so let's spend an hour talking about hypothetical future news i have an xy interview that i dug up that is very good but we have even though it's a slow new news week we have enough news where we don't have to dig up that x wire it's it's there it's we're saving it why are we saving it i play the long con it's like when travis was on the show and they gave me permission to read the email they wrote in and i saved it for like 17 weeks before we're saving the xy news article for the remakes yeah yeah yeah yeah um we do have some pokemon news uh not a lot but we do have some ranging from a variety of topics here we got some tcg we got some masters we got some go we got somebody breaking in and stealing pokemon cards you know the the plethora of things to to cover this this show but let's start off with um some tcg news which is uh from psa psa is a grading service psa i would say at this point psa is like the kleenex of grading services there are multiple grading services there's psa there's beckett there's like the other one i can't remember that no one uses and then there's another one that no one really uses but there's a bunch of them uh but everyone just defaults and says psa even though i feel like this is rep like good i think becca is fancier yeah when i was working in a card shop in my youth it was always about becca everyone's coming in to get the beckett book and everybody always talked about beckett and they would ask me questions about baseball cards and i'd looked at them like they had they were insane and then i would call over the sports card person and then he would talk to them about beckett this psa thing it's like a public service announcement yeah exactly i don't know i don't why is public service announcements raiding cards i mean it does not benefit the public to say that this charizard has bad edges whatever that means i think i think there's like two things here number one is psa is like easier to say than beckett kind of rolls off the tongue is it because it has more syllables yeah and psa is a bunch of letters well that's why i say it's like the kleenex because you could just call everything tissue but people just call everything kleenex at this point ah i see what you're saying and then the second thing is psa partnered with logan paul and so uh no i know i'm so caught by we talked about this before how logan paul bought like all these first edition original booster boxes and he then sent them in to psa and psa does their grading and they graded them but they also put logan paul on the grading so when when he resells them whether that's for personal gain or charity i think he's done some for charity look i'm trying to see the positive of some sort of light here um you could be like well this is a psa charizard this is a psa charizard but this is a psa charizard that was open from logan paul it's a logan paul psa charisma so it's tainted with racism all kinds of issues a lot of issues there i'm just saying i'm just giving you the reason why psa might be popular and which comes to the article psa customer update april 2021 which was published on march 30th hello psa customers since my wait wait wait can i just say it's a psa psa yep okay thank you go ahead let's skip skip something this uh i'll try to illustrate what has happened with the sheer volume of orders that psa received in early march has fundamentally changed our ability to service the hobby in reality is that we've recently received more cards in the last three days than we have in the last three months even after the surge submissions continue at a never before seen level given our growth i'm not a hundred percent what caused that specifically the three more cards in three days in the last three months um given our growing backlog it would be dangerous for disingenuous i think it's dangerous works disingenuous for us to continue and accept submissions for cards that we are unable to process for the foreseeable future it is an unpleasant conclusion especially after march 1st is price increase they increased how much they cost to grade i think it was like eight dollars before it might be like 14 or something um but it is necessarily to properly serve the customers who have already submitted to psa effective immediately psa is temporarily suspending our value regular and expressed service levels which will allow us to fully unbox and receive recent surge of orders to focus on our most impactive service lines we are taking a tiered approach to reintroducing these service levels back on july 1st um and then they are talking about how they have bought a 60 000 square foot california operation on top of adding another 62 000 square foot warehouse a couple months ago and that they have uh as of right now 783 people working for them and back in january of 2020 they only had 420 employees working for them and so yeah you can't uh i actually did a youtube video about this in february and in that youtube video i talked about how psa put out an article in december saying that they were falling dramatically behind and if you sent in cards in december or january you probably wouldn't get them back until june or july unless you paid for express and express you weren't even getting back quickly uh and now you can't send anything to psa so uh this is not even regular no everything is closed for people so hard is it to look at a card yeah oh yeah come on they're providing a quality service here they're not just [Music] it's just like how magnitude works in pokemon they just roll and i pick a number and send it back are you going to argue with them who's going to argue who are you going to go to you're going to go to beckett apparently not according to steve well you know well no i would go to becky i think it is because i'm pretty sure beckett has like beckett breaks down all four categories on the top part of it or psa doesn't psa just gives you a number beckett is like centering a 10. edge is a 9.5 hollow of 10. but also i've seen psa tens where the centering is way off and then somebody's always like ah well so-and-so is very generous on the centering and it's like what do you what do you mean isn't this supposed to be a standard no why would it be a standard it's literally people looking at it it's not like they have a computer program if they did this whole thing would be done that's what they need they need to put these 783 people on a computer program yes the artificial intelligences can be scanned you can rate these cards much faster than pitiful hitting cards is dumb it really is like yes but like because look i have i have where is it i have it buried on my desk i have this if you're if you're if you're losing the podcast i'm i'm showing your ego that's money right there shiny charizard yeah this whole article was an excuse for him to fight yeah what set is this from shining led shining face shining legendary fates shining legends leafy i pulled this look look look very very cool right and i can already tell you it's not a psa 10. why because i one i have eyes number two is there's like a small little white speckle here in the bottom corner you can barely see it you gotta bust out your detective pikachu magnifying glass to see it but i know if i send it to psa or beckett or whatever the other company are they're going to see that little dot that i see and they're going to be like it's a 9.5 it's a 9.2 it's a not like it's not a 10. so i even send it why would you send a card that you know is not going to be a 10. can you paint over that dot though nah and and look i i i open the pack very carefully like i do all my packs but buying pokemon cards is dumb yes because you can you can buy like a thousand packs of shining fates and they could all have bad edges there's nothing you can do to prevent it because no one knows until you open the pack and pokemon is has whatever quality control issues that they have and they're pumping them out the door as fast as possible so edges are always bad like centering is always mostly off sketch it's it's a dumb hobby so yes what are they going to do with all these people once the surge is over uh seasonal hiring yeah with a whole other factory target at christmas no you've you fire them and you say your time your usefulness has been yeah uh and then we're gonna close down this california operation because we aren't getting pokemon cards from logan paul anymore yeah but i mean the answer if you want an answer to your question it's once again not everybody is you and you you yes i don't send anything to psa exactly but but the thing is our average person who has just started buying up pokemon cards because they saw mr famous do it and they think it's a real thing is now also believes that for those pokemon cards to have any real value psa has to rate them yes so it's like they are literally going pack to hopefully top loader yeah without without even giving the card a a decent look just to get it graded yeah i i don't have anything i have one graded card and it was sent to me as a gift it's a first edition team rocket squirtle now the time it was sent to me as a gift because i was like i've never gotten a graded card before and the time it was sent for me as a gift i opened it on my twitch stream we they they said they like thank you for making content i really appreciate you here's a bunch of stuff and i was like wow like the first thought was like wow you sent me a psa card it must be worth something and i looked it up and it was like an eight dollar squirtle right but now that same squirtle card is worth five hundred dollars because prices have gone up so yeah i should sell it because no because when i got it was five dolla eight dollars but it was a gift and it feels very weird when you got it you got it for zero um and now you sell it like gamestop well my problem with psa cards is you can't put them in a binder there's like they just take up this extra space you've got to frame them yeah no they they are they're in the the no no you and then you buy a nice frame too so you can display it on your wall like the piece of art that it is yeah i guess i would only get something psa if i was to sell it because you're right it does increase like you can sell psa parts more for them yeah yes but i don't plan on selling my like i collect my carts to collect my carts like if i sold this charizard now i got a hole in my collection well but what's also even more bizarre to me is so you don't sell the extras well if i had two charizards yeah i would probably sell one of them but i only got one charizard it's a hard life only having one charizard oh here so here's the thing that's like even more bizarre to me is once you get a card psa rated you can't play with it anymore and i buy trading cards to play trading card games and it's like now it has zero value for me because i can't put it in a deck that's why i and they call me the oddball this is what we gotta do we gotta start collecting digimon cards get them graded now no no no that digimon game is that is like a disaster waiting to happen i heard it's good you you believe the hype go for it boy yeah enjoy i also look i'll i like some main i like some angemon padamon see i don't like the digimon characters that's really good start no i mean there's only one that throws poop that one's pretty cool no what is the one that throws poop i can't remember his name there's also a yokai watch that is like a butt face and yet still no not interested but i never got another yokai watch i tried i didn't either a copy of yo uh whisper is cool he's all right everyone else not not the the yom kim poor the little like red cat i can't remember his name it's something like yum yum come on greg get me back it up it's not final fantasy it's the lord to get the weapons and i do not remember any other ones kool-aid like toby kadachi toby kadachi it's the main red cat that's not whisper it's like yo whisper a ghost yeah whisper whisper is like the the ghost but they're all yo-kai they're all yo-kai may as well be ghosts like the red you need to watch to see him he's like the pikachu of yokai watch but that was jibanyan yeah yeah yeah no it's jib yaya isn't it i have no idea jib this is a bunch of adults trying to explain you you [ __ ] what what gamer yokai watch characters here i'm putting this in chat after i think the poop throwing digimon oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no no this one yeah yes jibanyan yeah yeah he's cool he's all right uh okay continuing with our tcg news battle styles still seems okay to find um so pokemon center we talked about last week how pokemon center put up battle styles on the website and then they said limit 72 and then it sold out in like 10 minutes well they did that again they put up cards the limit was still 72. it actually lasted on pokemon center for about 10 hours before they were completely sold out see they're getting there right now no battle styles on pokemon center i went to target yesterday they had battle styles on the shelf limit three i bought three i went to my secret place to get pokemon cards don't tell anyone listening to this podcast don't you dare tell anyone the secret place they get pokemon what is the secret place it's barnes noble you got it that's right but you gotta wait in line and ask for it yeah it's behind the counter yeah yeah so you go to bars and nobody should go all the time i should go to the target that time forgot and check out their stuff you look behind the counter they have it back there so they had blister packs at the barnes noble limit two so i got myself two blister packs look i'll wait in line for a blister i'm waiting online for a single pack i there is a target in houston texas that literally only sells pokemon cards you can only get three limit three at seven a.m on friday mornings i heard this yes that's how meyer is without the nobody meyer you can only get pokemon cards 3 p.m on fridays wow this is 3 p.m not 7 mean it's 00 like do they only put them out for an hour and then take them down i think you've got to line up and say i have my three packs please why this is madness it is extra madness oh okay it's not just pokemon cards it's pokemon mlb and mba i mean there is nothing left at my target i was there i don't know i i can guarantee you there's plenty of uh call time there wasn't there was nothing it was god like they're desperate i think they were moms and they're going i don't know this is the pokemon area i'll just buy this it says magic on it this must be a new type of pokemon well magic and yugi are still pretty easy to get at like all of my targets i i am pretty sure there's a baseball card phase right now that's happening like yeah because all the baseball cards stuff and nba cards because of nfts and people like well i can't buy an nft because i don't know what that means but i'll get an nba card because it's probably the same thing don't what is have we gotten to this point really where we're just buying things because we're so bored yes because we're this bored monster hunter came out and was very good i think it's one of the best monster hunters uh yes i agree advertisement will and i are doing a monster hunter podcast called the carve comes it came out on thursday i asked to be i will say i asked to be on the show to give my opinion about one thing and i was denied you didn't show up hey the zoom call was posted in the i was ring fitting when you did that you did that specifically during my reaction you either choose fitness or look i have to get a tetrahedron who is the opposite of fitness we know i have to get fit so i can go back to the gym i cannot go to the gym in my for my current condition this is a sad state of affairs so yeah you're right greg everything is sold out for the sake of being sold out so monster hunter came out you can't even get the the normal monster hunter yeah best buys don't have it everything is sold out yeah absolutely yes the base version the deluxe edition the big box with the big statue that you'll put on your shelf that will collect dust and then in like 10 years you'll throw up because you're like why did i ever buy this 10 years ago i but no but it's so weird because i've never wanted an amiibo in my life and now i want not going to use expletives amiibo it's like i want it and i can't find it anywhere i want the yeah i swore off amiibos i was wearing amiibos when amiibos were invented i i i have a diddy kong amiibo in my living room that i never will do i don't even know who diddy kong is what am i going to do it's one of the kongs dude watch godzilla first get your answers you get into slack and get your kong family education immediately unload amiibos i don't want them anymore i don't want the lynx or the zeldas or the captain falcons i don't want them the only things i want are my pokemon amiibos because they're pokemon i bought an incineroar amiibo yesterday because i'm worried now that maybe one day incineroar will be impossible to find i i now have an incineroar amiibo i'm missing pichu uh and i want animal crossing those are the only two amiibos i want my animal crossing amiibos i want my pokemon amiibos if you're diddy kong or anyone else you're you're going out the door i i'm i'll have to figure out how to get rid of them you like wheels i want these monster hunter amiibos they're impossible to find yeah you just can't find them although first clue uh buying them as individual amiibos i hate that these words are about to come out of my mouth gamestop exclusive yep so first off i'm not following amiibo news on twitter so when they tweet about amiibos being up i can click the link and then oh dang what what what are they even what what are the amiibos of the one's a dog one's the dog get one palamu one magnolo and one palico obviously and then once you have the the new monster and i think they give you exclusive outfits in the game when you scan them correct that are really cool okay that i was like and then you can use them in mario kart like yes the diddy kong amiibo and get me anything and try it i don't think it's ever got on there you could have got a diddy kong outfit you could have gotten a special diddy kong hunt where you hunt down the kong family kill them and carve them up for their pieces and then you wear funky kong's hat as a helmet you know i think monster hunter would sell even more if you could skin a funky kong and wear him as your outfit man if i could kill kongs get that good kong hunting okay can i i need to complain if that's the we don't there's not enough complaining on this show uh the whole support your local board game store i'm off this train why what shop local you jerk i there there's a there's a local board game store will has been to it many times yes called board game barrister yes that's where i pulled a full art mew from a pack of pokemon cards in 2013. i got a long history board game barrister i they you know they used to host pokemon leagues on sundays uh it's where i i met my friend kid uh his name is actually kid um two d's it's got two d's you've got two d's like nintendo met a lot of good people through board game barrister my friend vinnie through board game barrister and everything you know been going there for like eight years because of the pandemic they went from three locations to one location they like closed down two of their stores hard times i talked about like two weeks ago i walked in they had battle styles and they were charging 75 for an etb supply and demand so i went back into board game barrister this weekend i was like i need some more penny sleeves they didn't have any penny sleeves fine no big deal they had plenty of other sleeves i was only looking for penny um and then i saw they had uh uh uh an older sun and moon set on their shelf it was a three pack it was a necrozma special edition thing and from what i recall back in the sun and moon days which is like four years ago it was like a like a 1799 box of cards three booster packs of your your promo card and i was like how much is that in a charisma and they were like 35 and i was like that's double the price but also they don't print this anymore and i was like you know what supply and demand welcome to the world of magic the gathering yes well you know what support local game stores right i'll give me the necros mom here i'm spending five dollars on whatever i have in my hands give me the necrozma and i was like you know what hey do you guys have like those alolan so this is a thing they're doing with the tcg every month they're releasing jumbo size of starters so for march it was the galler starters it came in this big booster pack it's three jumbo cards and then it's two smaller booster packs and retail price for that is 9.99 and so i for for the youtube here's here's the here it is here's the the jumbo the jumbo booster pack this was the the gallery there you go so this is 9.99 and there's doing that every month so in april it's alola and then in uh may is whatever it is oh boy a rough conversation i yeah technically owen comes before our lola but yeah yeah we'll let that go so i was like hey do you guys did you guys get the uh you know it's april 3rd do you did you guys get the alolan things and they were like oh yeah and i was like oh cool they had like four of them i'd even see them on the shelf i was like let me get one of those this was my mistake hundred dollars 9.99 is msrp yes uh what's the s stand for steve in msu scam yes exactly uh the s is for suggested suggested not actual it's not mar or map they charged me 30 dollars triple the price wasn't even double it wasn't even 20. it wasn't 50 oh you know in my head when i was like give me one of those i was like i found it i don't have to worry about finding it online don't have to worry about shipping get the instant satisfaction like i know it's going to be more expensive maybe 15 maybe 20. 30 i'm taking it i'm returning it i haven't opened it i got the receipt i'm taking it back i can't but in the moment when they bring it to to get them where where no he doesn't really want them he was trying to be kind and generous and now he's going to get his money back and spend that money at mcdonald's where he'll get real value for his i want uh i want the alolans the the pack but when i but somebody was like oh my target had a bunch i i got a couple i'll send you one okay cool this is an issue though i agree because this is also an issue with the latest release for magic the gathering where the if you go to target you can get a pack for the pack price which i think for that one is six dollars and fifty cents if you go to your local game store you're not getting it if they even have any less for less than ten dollars and it's the same pack it's the same cards the barnes and noble which is like the same hallway as the barrister because again when will saw me in june we went to barnes noble it's in the same mall it's like less than 45 seconds they have tons of pokemon cards behind the counter msr actual msrp you you know limit two you know go back to your car put a wig on come back in get another two i mean it's fine um just wait till the employees rotate it doesn't matter but they got they have yeah i'm eager to see your collection of wigs so you can scan the bars noble i have all these wigs and glasses and noses that i put on so i can get more than my two packs of pokemon walking in two blister packs is more than enough for me i it is it is bold to charge three times the price of ultimately like there is nothing of value in this they just get value of any of them well you put it in there yeah in shining fates you can pull 500 charizard right no no no but still no no no in shining fates at least you have cards you can play these extra large cards you can't even play them unless you're playing a large card you're saying that i didn't want to pay extra for collector's items a thing that i can't even use a thing that is in high demand i think that larger chains get uh more access to apply to so barnes noble has a completely different distribution method than a local game store does so they have to eke out what's left after the giant corporations get it and you're waltzing in here saying i'm down with my local store that is fighting to survive against these giant corporations like dartmouth paris has darris has been overcharging people for years yeah but they had to close two locations you just said it was over here way in packs as well that's why i can't look if they want look what what am i looking at i'm looking at a scam artist with wigs in his car so you can rip off of barnes and noble is what i'm looking at i'm not ripping off bar i'm not buying poor mr yeah mr noble doesn't have food for his table when when oh me when i guess it's just how i would resell stuff like when when animal crossing was real hot don't you laugh at me when animal crossing was real hot remember this back a year ago a year ago exactly a year ago it was it was hot and sweaty people were all over animal crossing i was sitting on a gold mine of animal crossing tcg carts the amiibo cards i had i had all the good ones too i had the marshalls i had the the julians i had i had everything that people wanted and i had zero desire to use these cards like i i collected them i didn't have the full set i was like you know what and then and then people who like my content they were like can we buy these off you and i was like i don't even know how much they are and like the marshall card at the time was going for 80 on ebay and i couldn't in good faith sell these cards at what ebay was charging to people who support my content and i think i ended up selling marshall for like half the cost i was like i'm like i just felt awful and so like my mindset of going into a barrister i don't mind paying a little bit extra for something to get it right now but three times the price for ultimately just a silly collector's item that will not be worth anything oh it is that's all it is like i understand the the like it's hard to keep shining fates on shelves it is not hard right now to keep battle styles on shelves because this is what i said battle styles is not a particularly good set when when you open up this galler starter pack you get two booster packs you don't know what booster packs you are one of them is guaranteed sun and moon there's nothing in sun and moon that is worth more than like ten dollars there's like a full art lily that's maybe worth like 16 everything in this booster pack you're better off keeping this booster pack sealed and then putting it next to your hmu because if you open it you're gonna get 45 cents worth of value out of this and that comes in this so there the 30 for whatever the alolan i don't even know where it is it's my floor right now the the lowland starter i'm sure it comes with another sun and moon because they got to get rid of these it's all bad i can't like you're paying thirty dollars for ultimately two booster packs and three oversized jumbo cards that aren't worth anything and you paid it well he's going to return it because i hate it the problem is he didn't ask this is the problem that's real problem to learn is ask how much something costs before you make the purchase but you've like you've also just made me a salty customer of the audacity of charging that much you are only a salty customer because you have a group of people that are saying i have all of these others you have a group of people that said i got one at target for free if you had been spending all day searching your targets and you didn't find one and they finally had when you this is the last place you went and you really wanted this he'd be like yeah 30 bucks sounds reasonable for the amount of time i can go on cool stuff thinking get it right now for 20. the only difference is i gotta wait for like four four days for it to arrive yeah you're paying for instant now that's the thing they have it in stock taking up their space right now and that's the thing i think it's not the it's not like the base value it's it's the fact that it's three times the price so it was like a like i got news for you about clothing you know like if it was if it was even even something like uh the etb which is forty dollars and they're charging seventy five dollars for that's not technically double the price it's close but three times the price for this is is i don't know it's unbelievable well it's too far for you but it's not unbelievable for a lot of you yeah just you gotta you gotta believe it because that's where we are in the world right now we won't be here in a year from now yeah i mean they're they are in a tough spot hustling as best they can what if they're fighting against online vendors who are willing to cut things in half because online vendors have a vast network of people that they can get cards from that small shops generally don't have i don't think they're a small shop though i think they get i think they get plenty of how many locations are there in the in the united states right now they had three in the milwaukee look at that and how many are left one so what is your definition of a small shop if it's not a single shop in one city in america i mean as long as they're as long as they're treating their distributors like like this distribution is is more so like having a long relationship with somebody and then fulfilling the orders like you can yeah but the amount that you can order still even the same distribute distributor will give different prices to a much larger chain because they can they can order more so they get a better discount than a single shopkin like diamond comics can sell cheaper to a chain than the local mom and pop store no no i understand all of that right i understand that they may only get you know 200 etbs versus a target which gets you know 2 million etbs not all their stores i get that my complaint my core complaint is they're blatantly ripping off the customers that keep coming to that store instead of just being like put up a limit of like one pokemon per item and lower the price instead of trying to make a huge profit off the people who are trying to support you but they have that they have they have four they are counting on hopefully getting four people to come into their shop which may not happen to limit that product i mean they may only sell one a week because one person stops by their store and they have made an investment that they need to move at a price they need to price it at to to still make a profit because traffic is down and they don't have a thousand people going to a target who might buy it on impulse they have people who are specifically going out of their way to go to a board game store in a pandemic where there is one location they have to make the choices they have to make you don't have to buy it but i'm not going to knock them for the business price of their own price for charging and ripping off their core customers that's true that's that's kind of true that's kind of where my thoughts were going is like maybe they need to keep in mind that if they have better prices they would have more traffic through their store i mean their location is in a mall it's not out of the way good mall it's not a bad mall i mean i mean we're not talking brookfield square we're talking right yeah exactly we're talking mayfair here is okay brookfield squares down to two restaurants nobody goes to wauwatosa all right we're gonna take a break when we come back uh we will uh file the lawsuit for greg and being associated with brilliant small business big profits bring it bring it my lawyers will crush you we have a patreon we'll be back after the break [Music] that [Music] say is is a dynamax band and we are back from our break uh based on our past conversation this might be greg man breaks into card store with a rope stole pokemon cards they haven't caught me what does the rope have to do with anything listen to the isn't it uh come down from the ceiling type of thing mission impossible yeah they went through the air vents and then popped it open and then shimmy down the rope maybe maybe this is like tcg prices or so yeah just theft uh who sent this in uh haley sent this in uh in our slack community uh 28 year old japanese man in ikeburuko hey i was there ikibukaro yeah that's where i met the cult girl that's where oh yeah that's where uh do rah-rah-rah takes place as the pokemon center mega store is there which is probably the worst pokemon center i went to it was very it was like the brookfield square dang it was it was it was it was no me it was no my fair uh anyways 20 year old 28 year old japanese man has been arrested for the suspicion or of theft for stealing cash and trading cards worth thousands of dollars the man is suspected of stealing uh both pokemon cards and yu-gi-oh cards by breaking into a card shop he hung a rope from the roof into the top floor of a six-story building entering the building by breaking a window uh he s broke into a specialty card shop um i'm not card shop is all in japanese so i'm not sure what the name is he did that in uh at 5 00 a.m on march 23rd he stole a cash worth of um 300 000 yen which is a 2700 usd and 80 trading cards including pokemon and yu-gi-oh with an estimated value of 1 million yen which is about nine thousand dollars usd uh according to tokyo police in their investigation their the man's statement was quote i was in rock climbing club when i was a student and i thought these would sell well uh end quote this was also timing i don't think there is there's a skateboarding anime that's actually not bad and actually not good uh this was also paying off his debt that he admitted uh so he yeah stealing to pay off debt um there's some more stuff here but that's pretty much the gist of it i mean i learned a lot of what not to do so how do you get caught i don't know it doesn't say interesting look it's a slow news week this is what i got at least at least it is within the current time period that we're in and it has gone back to the past i mean it happened two weeks ago that's pretty news relevant pretty newsworthy uh just chose to go yeah crime doesn't pay correct unless you're the barrister and you're charging three times that's not crime that's not crying it's highway robbery i'm pretty sure that ball isn't on a highway uh learn to read on a lighter note this is on pokemon.com learn to read with pokemon primers abc book and pokemon primers one two three book these are already sold out by the way i know i tried to eat them for you steve but they were sold out i will never know the proper alphabet now you can put

it interesting that they left out the key uh sets of foundation for a future pokemon consumer starting at an early age dude kids start reading three two no no you gotta you gotta get kindergarten it's the real reading time people start kids early i don't know yeah that's true me my nieces and nephew all knew sign language before the age of one so but that's just language acquisition that's

so the striker pokemon is cinderache yes okay so they just did the liliganth event last week they hit us with another event this week and i am out of wishing pieces i was able to get shiny as a girl you out of wishing pieces yeah i haven't heard of look i spent 200 last week and i spent 200 this week it's a rough life kind of forgot about this whole event because we were watching the second season of the time it got reincarnated as a slime which has literally eaten up because we restarted the entire series from episode one and then discovered season two was out and that's all i've been doing this weekend so i did not play any of this and i'm not sure whether you recommended that atomy to me because it's actually good or you're trying to chicken into watching some real garbage it is my top three anime it is in the top three i love it very very very look they are trying to keep people home so you folks will stop running out like wild men and women grabbing up all the tcg cards yeah sorry like let's get some special stuff going on sword and shield to keep them at home so we can finally restock the shelves and bring prices down let's celebrate pagan holidays by throwing a bunch of bunnies up yes um the cinderella ice was cool it was uh i was hoping maybe it would be like hard mewtwo or zero aura or is it a little tricky but that's pretty easy those aren't bunnies i mean you're right you couldn't catch you couldn't catch the cinder race but it did give a lot of candy i think it gave 6xl and then 6l and the other rewards it normally gave so it was it was quick it like i would say the cinder race was easier than the azumarill zoomer was real thick it took a took a while to knock knock them out well i mean has always been a beefy boy yeah also azumarill had sap zipper so the amount of people that would bring in grass type pokemon and then use a grass type move and then i was like oh gosh yeah look who's talking buddy yeah yeah captain storm drain mr pot let's talk to the kettles yeah not only did i bring a venusaur because venus or resist water type moves i was hitting him with the old sludge bomb because you know fairy week to poison it's the best of both worlds you know who's better at that rose raid uh gigantomax venusaur no pokemon masters what's up pokemon.com scout to diantha and gardevoir and battle latias in pokemon masters ex and that well they don't even have it in here okay oh yeah and then the may and low bunny yeah and bird bird berg berg and togepi yeah it just says that look i'm not gonna read the press release it just says that these characters are added to masters did you get your diana i got two two dose man hill good pulse and i'm now out of gems that's what happens with gotcha games so you're not going to pull for may or i tried to pull i had a few left i tried to pull for me i again got all threes which i'm going to give them a whole bunch of feedback about how i think i think dna is listening greg i pulled a lot and i was getting non-stop four stars uh well that's how randomization works because just as many people didn't so i was swimming in the four stars and i thought of you the entire time yeah uh i mean i got i got iris and i have i got diantha twice which brings you know power oh you got iris nice uh and then who did i get just randomly oh i got bianca for i'm like oh i didn't have bianca okay this is literally one that nobody uses yeah but now you got it for your collection yeah well that's right digital collection i pulled a lot on may i ended up getting peers which is cool um but no may so i'll pull again like a week or two i gotta i gotta save some more uh the easter event is fine yeah it's i guess okay is diantha the easter event no she's the 1.5 anniversary event uh the i'm not a huge fan of the fact that like in previous events you could just go to the lower levels and get all the eggs all you needed and you know they use them in various combinations this time they added a high-end lucario rate that you can only get from the ultra hard battle or you can trade in lower ones at a really bad rate lower lucario's yeah so there's different eggs there's beniri eggs and torchic eggs and togepi eggs and you can combine them to make lucario eggs are we talking about masters yeah what where what what what do you mean where okay are you talking about the easter event they just added yeah oh i haven't done that yet i thought you were talking about the like iggly buff eggs that they added we talked about like last week is that where like everybody puts in one egg and then you like spin it and then it keeps hitting the spin and then everybody gets a random egg out of it i wish because you're talking about remember when pokemon was fun yeah yeah it was when things were reasonably repriced and not triple is it oh is this who we've become yeah they are old pokemon complainers bringing back mini games in pokemon games man are we talking about passions egg explorers yes okay i haven't done that yet and you said it's okay uh i mean the event is fine like the story is fine it's a it's it's a it's it's i think it's one of their weaker storylines but do me do me a favor and go into the exchange items um i see togepi egg banary egg oh yeah okay i see that exchange items is under store right yep gotta go to trisha real quick wait till they give her a pokemon yeah why doesn't she have a pokemon 50 lucario eggs gets you okay 300 lucario eggs gets you the tech move candy yeah or the support move candy or the strike move candy but if you go down you'll see that you can get lucario eggs by doing an exchange at a terrible terrible rate oh i see so you can do 40 togepi and 20 banary for 10 lucario yep doesn't seem uh did you see how much it costs to get the tech move it's 300 or karaoke to get a coin yeah but the coins are bad you want the candy the candy is good right the candies 200 yeah but 200 is not that bad how long does it take to get a lucario egg uh i've been doing this let me see let me try to do an exchange uh 18 days that's a lot of time right now i've been playing since this event was done doing just the bare minimum and i can get exactly 20 lucario eggs from my time put in so just do that ten more times yeah and then you got eight days left over don't give me that look that's logic greg logic we'll figure it out i'll do it i'll do it we'll come we'll circle back on it next week sometimes i feel like masters is by the way full disclosure uh partnered with dna i feel like some times masters is too generous with their exchange rates uh i have never seen that what the last event it was like super easy to do it it was the um it was like the gallery event the gallery event was like super easy to get everything yeah but why is that a bad thing i mean you still had to play it every day to be able to get everything on that list oh i did it well i don't want everything on the list i only want like the top four items because everything else on the list is like stuff i have a million of yeah but that's not everybody okay yeah but if you just want the top items it took me like three days to get everything okay i don't want to spend why is that a bad thing no that that because then you're then you're like i have nothing to do you don't have nothing to do you have a lot of other things to do in that game if you want like what you're saying is i don't want to i i want to spend all of my time playing this special event in this special event only and not doing any of the other things in that game um i would say that's what it feels like with this egg with the exploration event i would say like a lot of the masters events aren't compelling enough for two weeks of repetition i would say they're compelling enough for like a week of repetition but i don't mind them lasting two weeks because because i might miss the first like five days but i mean repetition is with an asterisk because once you complete it once you just skip ticket it and you have at this point i have five thousand skips i mean i'm literally not spending any of my time doing these events but saying skip ticket it ten times so that gets back to my fundamental question of are you actually playing this game or uh i mean i play the event the first time to complete it and then once i've completed it i don't need to prove to the game 500 more times that i know how to defeat their puzzle i don't get it look this isn't a garden scapes where they repeat puzzles and it doesn't like they don't there's only so many ways the jewels can fall you'd be surprised and it's not jewels what is it flowers i think i think the thing you might be missing about masters will is there's there's always like four levels of difficulty there's like the easy that you do once and then never again there's the normal that you do once and then never again and then there's the hard that you do once and then you then you pour your skip tickets into it and then there's like a very hard there's ultra hard or whatever it's called that i almost never do i never do it because it is super hard and it requires you to like plan because instead of like one battle of three v three which is mo like which is not 99 of masters it's a nine verse nine battle yeah so you will get knocked out with your three and then you're allowed six more and you have their remaining team so you go back in for a second time and then so you actually have to like strategize what nine pokemon you're gonna bring who is going to open yep and then if you get knocked out you need to like strategize okay i need to bring in a pokemon to clear these statuses because they'll remember all their boosts from last time and i'm going in fresh yeah so that whole battle takes a a lot of planning and it it's very grindy and there's there is trial and error you're probably going to fail the first three words must be tremendous they aren't that it's they're okay they're okay i mean they are they are hard to get rewards i mean the other thing that they do is that you have to have nine a lot of times you have to have them at the very top level so the 130 level cap so you need to find nine that you have dumped all your resources in that like if you picked your knife to do that too because that's a lot of resources they may not be worth anything when you're fighting this particular ultra hard one so the ultra hard stuff is very much a grind that i am not into i just i i don't want to have to sit down and like plan out half an hour of what night i mean i don't know what it sounds like playing in the game yeah that's 100 playing the game but it is like i mean it's not it it's like saying that savage difficulty raids in final fantasy 14 is playing the game it's not like you can still get that exact same experience from the normal encounter raids savage has improved difficulty but that's not playing the game any better or more so this is my issue playing the difficult is playing the ultra difficult for questionable rewards so this this is kind of my my approach to kind of looking at this kind of a thing for games like doom where i want to play them for the story then i do them on the lowest difficulty that's something of a joke because obviously doom has no story for games like pokemon masters which has no story it has a story everywhere has a story sorry it has a story mode really it does it does first story runs away during the egg event and it's mixed in with all the eggs i will i will never fault masters for having like actually the best silver and giovanni storyline that the main series game couldn't even bother telling the interact one of the best part of masters is the storyline and the interactions that they have between the trainers the rest is okay to get the story without really trying how yeah yeah you just look at screenshots well i mean so all of the the stories are always just getting through the low-level content and the low-level content is really easy to get through so you just do the normal difficulties to just get the storyline out of the way and then to collect the rewards it's the hard and ultra hard content if you want the rewards and the rewards part that's questionable like each each event may or may not give you things of worth that are that are easy or fun to get so yeah we'd know that diantha is our lgbtq queen she is if it wasn't for pokemon story she doubt and she is and she's amazing and also how do we know about wallace and steve on their honeymoon out in out looking for stones if it wasn't for the storyline how would we know about how capes and champions work if it wasn't for the storyline one of the best storyline moments in the game how will we know hilbert's secret hobby if it wasn't for the halloween event and pokemon secret hobby secret hobby you know he dressed up as a werewolf and oh that's right living the dream he's living the dream as a werewolf there's a lot of stream the stories the stories are the stories of masters are absurd and they're the greatest thing of that game it's the one thing that keeps me coming back because you just have no idea this most current the easter story line is not great there's no real great moments in there well i mean they're using berg and he's well they're using mate the story centers are on may and brandon being all dramatic with each other and wally shows up for not enough time man that cyrus story line was pretty awesome the cyrus storyline was great like okay you're still a person that wants to murder everybody in the world but why don't you work out with us i guess i'll destroy the world later shouldn't he be taken somewhere he literally states multiple times that he wants to blow up the entire universe he was taken somewhere passio yeah i didn't pass you i was like i'm still gonna blow everything up but i i guess i'll hang out for a while uh okay last bit of news here is pokemon go uh so the referral program is available now it's worldwide um you can refer a friend by going to your friend's stream a friend screen or stream maybe i don't know you tap the invite and then you share the code with somebody who has never played pogo or somebody who hasn't played in 90 days my only response to that is thanks irene i'm going to be letting her not in 90 days she hasn't opened it since the kanto event so set that timer uh once they import the code either during the sign up process or in the front screen later you will both receive rewards as your friends reach milestones on their journey you'll both receive more rewards make sure to help them all out out along the way what are the rewards um they're pretty good did they specify somewhere because i didn't look but not online in the news article yeah because it says the receive rewards like pokemon encounters rare candy and incubators and more incubators i could use i don't have a list of the rewards but there are youtubers and websites that have the list of all they are like one of them is gibbel i know gibbel will spawn for both people i hatched a gibble the other day there's like stardust there's like exclusive stickers stardust i do not need stickers oh here we go so if you referred somebody so you would be inviting somebody else uh one you would get a gallerian farfetch you would get a bag on a darmaka charizard dino gibble 50 mega energy raid pass three incense two super incubators 30 rare candy five super incubators uh 10 pikachu stickers 10 pidgey stickers and then if you were the person that was referred if you were the one new to pokemon go you would get a raid pass a super incubator charizard chansey mega energy fiverr candy lapras three raid passes three super incubators five raid passes a snorlax a lapras um 10 pikachu stickers 10 pidgey stickers so i think the rewards are pretty all right yeah it's pretty good i mean i don't think anyone's going to complain for getting a gimbal by recommending somebody seems pretty good and then uh the easter event is happening in pogo right now is it because i only saw a mana this morning yeah you're getting flower crown pikachu flower crown chansey execute merrell plussel mining banari bundle b which is now shiny wasn't shiny before no but nary was shiny shiny bunny now shiny that's speaking of events that's just another event they'll they'll all seem fine but that's your pokemon go minute i think that's all our news we're probably forgetting something but uh we need to save something for next week so that's fine that's true yeah we need to store it up oh did we call for question of the week yes oh yeah yeah yeah what's the question of the week won't you give us something to talk about i almost kind of maybe [Laughter] almost kind of maybe yeah i'm not quite sure what it was brandon says what are your favorite and least favorite puzzles in mainline series games i dislike most of the pushing rock puzzles oh those are bad i just they're either they're on multiple levels which just is just a pain to to remember where you are and then if you didn't do it right they reset or they don't reset i all the rock pushing puzzles are my least favorite puzzles period also they're always in caves so it's like zubat central it's just it's just annoying from beginning to end i do not like them uh favorite i liked the cannon i don't think it was a puzzle though remember when you got shout out to cannons in skyler's gym you had a point you had to go to the campus yes yeah cause you had to like get the right ones that was funny what is that black and white one because in black and white too skyla's gym is you have to hide behind the walls when the wind blows yeah this yeah yeah yeah and then there's that you step on the ice and it cracks and then if you step on it again you fall i like the slighty ice puzzles better than the cracky ice puzzles i like both i mean they're both better than rock puzzles oh 100 that's not a high bar uh yeah i like the sliding puzzles a lot i think i like the sliding puzzles more but i like the the steppy puzzles i wish the quiz puzzles were more interesting because it was blaine and clement both had neither one of them were all that interesting i was actually going to say that clements was my favorite puzzle because in order to register every pokemon in pokemon xy as seen with only one game you actually had to get clemont's puzzle wrong oh to be able to see the other pokemon otherwise you would come out with an incomplete scene pokedex what other puzzles are there i mean my least favorite puzzle i would have to say is uh the the rayquaza tower i've said it before just like the having to go use your bike to get over the cracked floor fast enough and like make the turns and everything is that a puzzle or is that like a skill challenge well because it was pretty basic yeah straight forward i mean also like the ultra worm holes right do you count them as a puzzle because i also find those to be quite terrible whatever wolf wolf is that's a puzzle i don't know what that's called the spinny ice gym the mechanics where you step out yeah you spin it line it up i guess that would be similar to like claire's also rotate like in hard cold soul silver you have to like rotate those platforms and then push them over the line oh yeah yeah yeah it's like very similar to wolf rick's just there's just nothing to do with complexity in pokemon game puzzles because it is an all ages game so it's like you don't want to have your kid handing the yes over and saying hey could you could you solve this for me it's duke confusing didn't fantina's gym have two puzzles between the two games yeah but i don't remember them different because when was he had to go through the doors in the dark oh you know what puzzles the worst sabrina slash valerie's puzzle the teleporting ones are just dumb they're just frustrating there's not like a strategy to them there's just you remember which ones take you where yeah and then you're good right there's not like uh no i think it's i mean this is like the team rocket gym based puzzle too the teleporters take you and then you use the elevator for certain things well team flare was the same thing yeah they're just not that interesting i find them very interesting i still find them better than rock puzzles the mystery house was always fun because you had to keep coming back yeah the trap house the mystery tap house yeah yeah i like the trap house omega ruby alpha sapphire rubies it was in ruby yeah ruby sapphire and emerald yeah it's just outside of slateport you go north and there's the guy that's like welcome to yeah well you go in and you don't see anybody and he's like i'm hiding can you find me and then you kind of just click around and then you eventually find him and he's like tomorrow and then he's like come into my trap come into my trap house and you walk in the back and then you have to go through the the ever-changing rooms cocos was pretty okay the like invisible walls that was pretty all right yeah i can't believe they've only done skyler's thing once like the the the air pushing you back like that that is actually a pretty cool puzzle yeah but there's not been another really good flying gym you know just copying like look we literally copy and paste in sabrina's to valerie's it is the only thing different is there's a reason for that though so there was yeah yeah you're in a house you had to teleport around the house because they're fairy tapes well but also if you notice the x and y had a lot of like copy and paste yeah yeah yeah i mean i thought there was like a lore reason not an original forest that you go through i think the layout was exactly the same it uh what what olympia's gym is that do we consider that a puzzle that's really no it's walking at a path yeah oh wait catching the fur fro in the in the gardens oh yeah oh that's like the like the farfetch'd thing too yeah those are okay there's they're way too they're way too short and simple to be like that engaging you like you look at that that's pokemon puzzles really apparently we all know the best pokemon puzzles were shuffle no pokemon shuffle yeah you gotta wait till saturday morning so you can do the meowth one yeah get all the coins yeah oh man i had strats that game is literally what got me into the practice of like when i first wake up in the morning playing a video game for like 15 minutes before doing anything else will pokemon of the week oh boy wait before pokemon of the week when does that pokemon snap thing come out when is that that's this month that's right 30th oh we got a whole month to get through for it huh damn probably have like one more trailer for it all right where's my last week's pokemon last week's pokemon was one that some people could guess but obviously not greg because he tried to cheat and ask me who was the pokemon look i couldn't i couldn't find my sheet i found it there was a lot of uh fluff in here because i was very distracted last week and uh the pokemon is not featured in pokemon generations um it looks basically like if you stare at the actual pokemon it looks like the ends of its upper arms look like fangs and then its knees kind of look like teeth and then it's kind of middle section looks like a open mouth tongue thing uh so it looks like it could be a pre-evolution to guzzlord um you can only find it in nature on victory road in sinnoh in a dragon friend safari if you count that as finding it in nature and in the haina desert through an sos battle and you can't find it in pokemon masters all right who is it [Music] hip hop no it's gabayt gabite yes correct that is correct yes it's funny that it looks like an open mouth kind of like if you i like pretty much all of that lines designs yes i think all the designs of the whole gibbel line are really cute well that also that it's like nibble bite chomp yup it's always fun when they do those kinds of things uh i mean gabae and garchomp both look like airplanes i mean and it doesn't really set off my shark fear so interesting interesting um but it's funny that they look like airplanes even though they're not flying in any way or shape or form one of the pokemon that looks like it could be a monster hunter monster true true uh shuffle icon good uh gabbite shares the same category with drudging they're both known as cave pokemon gabites scales were stated to cure sickness in the anime special pokemon in the in the anime special pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of time and darkness there was an anime for pokemon mystery dungeon yeah i remember that i certainly don't what is that i show up on pokemon i don't remember this at all due to the sensor that prevented pokemon with offensive nicknames being traded in the gts an english language gabbite cannot be traded on the gts without a nickname in black and white what is the bad word uh cowboy bite uh no idea yeah i remember i think it had something with the i think i had to do something with the bite part of it but i don't remember what that's weird huh is there any other pokemon with the word bite in their name i don't think so i guess it would have to be bite like bite my butt yeah bite me oh bite me yeah that could be it how offensive is that i mean that looks like a bart simpson simpson says that all the time he also says eat my shorts yeah well all right what about next week all right was really unprepared this week so i'm not even certain if this is gonna allow people to hone in on a pokemon we're not good luck kids uh a is for the ability thick fat p is for purple shiny r is for the region hohen i is for ice ball l is for lower brine cave would you like me to repeat
