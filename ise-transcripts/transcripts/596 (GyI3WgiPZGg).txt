B what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:28)
596 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:25 - 0:30)
super effective I am your host Steve (0:28 - 0:33)
with me is Hannah I am here I have done (0:30 - 0:35)
almost nothing but play Pokemon for the (0:33 - 0:38)
last however many days since the DLC (0:35 - 0:40)
came out and I am almost bursting with (0:38 - 0:42)
thoughts about the story but we're not (0:40 - 0:44)
talking about the story (0:42 - 0:47)
today we we are not we will talk about (0:44 - 0:51)
the story next week um but Al is also (0:47 - 0:53)
here yes and I'm here to do one thing (0:51 - 0:55)
only and that's talk about the new Larry (0:53 - 0:58)
lore that dropped from the paldan winds (0:55 - 1:00)
episode this week that's all (0:58 - 1:02)
that's the only important thing to talk (1:00 - 1:07)
about here for p uh we have Al back we (1:02 - 1:09)
uh kind of skipped over Al for the teal (1:07 - 1:10)
mask which I don't think was Fair since (1:09 - 1:13)
we had Al on (1:10 - 1:17)
for the uh Pala (1:13 - 1:19)
miniseries Al you like the teal mask (1:17 - 1:21)
give (1:19 - 1:21)
a yeah well okay right very quick review (1:22 - 1:26)
of the te M then apparently yes no I (1:25 - 1:27)
liked (1:26 - 1:31)
it I I I am not a fan of the (1:27 - 1:35)
uh um lying uh but uh you know other (1:31 - 1:38)
than that I think it was it was good um (1:35 - 1:41)
but I prefer this one this one's better (1:38 - 1:44)
yeah yeah yeah so H Hannah gave uh dead (1:41 - 1:45)
giveaway here we're not going to be (1:44 - 1:48)
talking about the story we will be (1:45 - 1:51)
talking about mechanics so like the (1:48 - 1:54)
elite four members all have somewhat of (1:51 - 1:57)
a story uh but I think it's important to (1:54 - 1:59)
talk about like maybe what they did with (1:57 - 2:01)
that and kind of push the story aside (1:59 - 2:03)
although there's a lot of other things (2:01 - 2:04)
we can talk about so that's not like a (2:03 - 2:06)
pressing issue of like we need to talk (2:04 - 2:09)
about what you need to do in the flying (2:06 - 2:11)
trial which I guess I technically (2:09 - 2:12)
already talked (2:11 - 2:15)
about yeah but you talked about it wrong (2:12 - 2:17)
it's not (2:15 - 2:19)
reversed and that's the (2:17 - 2:22)
problem well to be fair to be fair it (2:19 - 2:24)
might have been reversed on the build (2:22 - 2:27)
that he had but yeah the the first I I (2:24 - 2:28)
was really confused because I don't like (2:27 - 2:30)
inverted camera controls and apparently (2:28 - 2:34)
I do like inverted flying controls right (2:30 - 2:39)
exactly my reaction yeah I think okay (2:34 - 2:42)
the the I don't remember whether I (2:39 - 2:43)
pressed up or (2:42 - 2:46)
down because that was also two months (2:43 - 2:49)
ago and I one feels right and one feels (2:46 - 2:51)
wrong yeah right right right and I had (2:49 - 2:52)
to remember like 40 minutes of (2:51 - 2:55)
information CU I like I'm on a timer I (2:52 - 2:58)
can't like you're writing down the cor (2:55 - 2:59)
start like writing down right like (2:58 - 3:01)
Nintendo ref is sitting there being like (2:59 - 3:03)
you you need to hurry up you have 20 (3:01 - 3:06)
minutes so like she told me it was (3:03 - 3:09)
inverted and so I think if she didn't (3:06 - 3:11)
say anything I probably wouldn't have (3:09 - 3:15)
like like I don't know when I did it (3:11 - 3:17)
again we're talking about the flying of (3:15 - 3:20)
the the the what's her name the trial (3:17 - 3:22)
amoris amoris we're talking about the (3:20 - 3:26)
flying in amaris's trial um I remember (3:22 - 3:27)
going through all the Rings and only (3:26 - 3:30)
missing one in my Nintendo thing and she (3:27 - 3:32)
was like oh like you did way better than (3:30 - 3:33)
I did and I was like okay cool look (3:32 - 3:35)
whatever and then when I did it again (3:33 - 3:38)
for real I did all of them just fine (3:35 - 3:41)
like I I hit all of them and even at the (3:38 - 3:44)
end of that I was like I don't like this (3:41 - 3:45)
can you change it and last week we (3:44 - 3:48)
talked about boy I hope there's an (3:45 - 3:50)
option to change it they did that if in (3:48 - 3:52)
the settings you can go in and you can (3:50 - 3:56)
flip it and I think it's normal but you (3:52 - 3:58)
turn on the (3:56 - 4:01)
inverted I don't like (3:58 - 4:04)
either I can't tell which one I like or (4:01 - 4:08)
not like I absolutely had an instinctive (4:04 - 4:10)
no reaction to the normal I was not (4:08 - 4:12)
flying well but also I think part of (4:10 - 4:14)
that was because I had turned off the (4:12 - 4:16)
camera tracking with the setting we got (4:14 - 4:18)
from the teal mask and so I had turned (4:16 - 4:20)
off that setting which actually makes (4:18 - 4:24)
flying harder I found that when you are (4:20 - 4:26)
doing the trial if you're trying to redo (4:24 - 4:28)
the flying trial if you want to do (4:26 - 4:30)
really well make sure your camera track (4:28 - 4:33)
is on I think I have that off I think (4:30 - 4:34)
there is something with the camera that (4:33 - 4:36)
makes it (4:34 - 4:39)
weird maybe that's why I don't like it (4:36 - 4:40)
I'm going to apologize to all the (4:39 - 4:43)
inverted people I think inverted flying (4:40 - 4:46)
is better but inverted camera controls (4:43 - 4:48)
are (4:46 - 4:51)
bad yeah that's well I think good and (4:48 - 4:53)
bad depends on your personal preference (4:51 - 4:55)
right but yes I personally would would (4:53 - 4:57)
agree with that camera controls non (4:55 - 5:00)
inverted flying controls inverted I (4:57 - 5:02)
called everyone a monster for liking (5:00 - 5:05)
inverted controls but I think I like it (5:02 - 5:08)
but only for flying yeah yeah well (5:05 - 5:09)
because that's how that's how flight (5:08 - 5:11)
Sims have have always worked right (5:09 - 5:13)
because that's how planes work and so if (5:11 - 5:16)
you've ever done any flying in any game (5:13 - 5:18)
that is how it will will go it feels (5:16 - 5:20)
like a weird decision to make this (5:18 - 5:21)
especially I think the camera controls (5:20 - 5:24)
were inverted by default which is the (5:21 - 5:26)
opposite I can't remember it's been too (5:24 - 5:28)
long since I've started the game aresh (5:26 - 5:29)
but I feel like I had to change that (5:28 - 5:30)
setting (5:29 - 5:32)
no definitely not I restarted a month (5:30 - 5:37)
ago I'm just misremembering then I yeah (5:32 - 5:40)
there's I I there's something with the (5:37 - 5:43)
flight where maybe Hannah's right the (5:40 - 5:46)
what did you say camera following the (5:43 - 5:48)
camera tracking yeah camera tracking (5:46 - 5:50)
okay I'm GNA toggle that because like I (5:48 - 5:52)
just have okay the thing about the (5:50 - 5:54)
flight is I'm glad it's in the game it (5:52 - 5:56)
it (5:54 - 5:56)
works I I don't see a big use for it (5:56 - 6:02)
because I just walk everywhere or (5:59 - 6:04)
technically I don't know like drive (6:02 - 6:07)
everywhere and the reason I do that is (6:04 - 6:08)
because I'm picking up items off the (6:07 - 6:12)
ground and I'm like looking at Pokemon (6:08 - 6:14)
and I find a lot of shinies that way (6:12 - 6:17)
like I again I I don't really turn on (6:14 - 6:19)
urbom mystica unless I'm specifically (6:17 - 6:22)
hunting for something um so I I don't (6:19 - 6:24)
know it kind of feels like one flying is (6:22 - 6:27)
slower than just driving your (6:24 - 6:30)
bike it's hard to tell whether that's (6:27 - 6:33)
perspective thing or not yeah and then I (6:30 - 6:35)
think part you have to be pretty close (6:33 - 6:37)
to the ground to spawn stuff you do I (6:35 - 6:40)
think part of the issue is there is no (6:37 - 6:43)
like boost in flying um and there is a (6:40 - 6:45)
boost on the ground so you can go faster (6:43 - 6:48)
on the ground and in in Legends they had (6:45 - 6:49)
a boost when you were flying with the (6:48 - 6:51)
like on (6:49 - 6:55)
Braviary wowow like hit exactly exactly (6:51 - 6:58)
exactly and uh but and I think this the (6:55 - 7:00)
spawns is a good point because in (6:58 - 7:02)
Legends you were you didn't have to be (7:00 - 7:05)
very high up at all and you were always (7:02 - 7:06)
spawning things on the ground the number (7:05 - 7:08)
of times like I was flying and I would (7:06 - 7:11)
hear something Sparkle on the ground and (7:08 - 7:12)
go down to get it whereas obviously the (7:11 - 7:14)
noise doesn't exist in this game as well (7:12 - 7:15)
so yeah if you're really wanting to make (7:14 - 7:17)
sure you catch all the shinies you're (7:15 - 7:20)
never flying but I mean in this game I'm (7:17 - 7:21)
actually really enjoying kind of (7:20 - 7:23)
skimming right above the ground making (7:21 - 7:24)
sure I'm not running into any of the (7:23 - 7:26)
tiny Pokemon on accident but close (7:24 - 7:28)
enough that you can see any of the (7:26 - 7:30)
Pokemon that are spawning also was using (7:28 - 7:33)
it a ton when I was farming (7:30 - 7:38)
BBQ's uh quests blueberry quests because (7:33 - 7:40)
with all of the tasks that ask you to go (7:38 - 7:43)
from one (7:40 - 7:46)
uh uh what's the biome one biome to (7:43 - 7:49)
another with combined with the tasks (7:46 - 7:50)
that ask you to go however many (7:49 - 7:52)
kilometers or whatever the measurement (7:50 - 7:55)
is in game like 500 yeah it counts (7:52 - 7:58)
flying and so I would just fly from one (7:55 - 8:00)
biome to another to go get that photo (7:58 - 8:02)
over there but I would also complete the (8:00 - 8:05)
task in the traveling and so I was using (8:02 - 8:07)
it a ton then certainly faster if you're (8:05 - 8:10)
trying to get the dle blocks yes do you (8:07 - 8:12)
does again I can't I can't tell if (8:10 - 8:15)
flying is slow or if if the game is Just (8:12 - 8:18)
frame R like that's very blurry between (8:15 - 8:20)
those two but it almost feels like (8:18 - 8:22)
gliding is faster than flying well did (8:20 - 8:26)
you notice the gliding is fixed in (8:22 - 8:30)
now you notice that so the the issue (8:26 - 8:31)
with gliding is always like you go a (8:30 - 8:32)
really small amount and then you start (8:31 - 8:34)
basically plummeting to the ground which (8:32 - 8:37)
is not gliding that's just falling um (8:34 - 8:39)
but I I haven't figured out whether (8:37 - 8:40)
because I haven't opened up my other (8:39 - 8:42)
game where I haven't unlocked the flying (8:40 - 8:44)
to see whether it's the the update (8:42 - 8:46)
that's fixed or whether it's flying (8:44 - 8:47)
that's fixed it but that doesn't happen (8:46 - 8:49)
anymore you can you can infinitely Glide (8:47 - 8:52)
now oh what I went from I went from the (8:49 - 8:55)
middle of paa all the way to the bottom (8:52 - 8:59)
and did not didn't do the pting yeah (8:55 - 9:01)
just normal gliding it didn't suddenly (8:59 - 9:04)
do hug difference the plummet and I I (9:01 - 9:07)
suspect I suspect it's the flying that (9:04 - 9:08)
did that because my question was always (9:07 - 9:10)
like oh does this mean you could like (9:08 - 9:12)
Fly for a bit and then Glide for a bit (9:10 - 9:14)
and then fly for like so I tried you're (9:12 - 9:16)
saying not you're saying not the update (9:14 - 9:18)
DLC you're saying once you unlock flying (9:16 - 9:20)
from I think it's that I haven't tested (9:18 - 9:21)
I haven't tested that it could it could (9:20 - 9:24)
be the update I don't know I know there (9:21 - 9:27)
is momentum to Flying Like if you try to (9:24 - 9:29)
take off on the ground you're like stuck (9:27 - 9:33)
in this like slower mode versus like oh (9:29 - 9:34)
yeah you got to boost before you fly (9:33 - 9:37)
yeah you have to boost I did notice that (9:34 - 9:39)
but I again I think I think I maybe (9:37 - 9:41)
maybe I'm just bad at video (9:39 - 9:44)
games well we all know that yeah yeah (9:41 - 9:47)
that's true but like I struggle to take (9:44 - 9:49)
off of the ground not like a cliff or (9:47 - 9:51)
like a hill like for me it's it's very (9:49 - 9:53)
hard to like boost and then jump and (9:51 - 9:55)
then like activate flying and then get (9:53 - 9:57)
away from the ground before hit it's (9:55 - 9:58)
four things right you have you have to (9:57 - 10:00)
boost and then jump and then Glide and (9:58 - 10:03)
then fly right you have to do the Glide (10:00 - 10:05)
fly which is the difficult bit yeah and (10:03 - 10:07)
that's that's why I'm like there's there (10:05 - 10:09)
feels like there's something wrong with (10:07 - 10:11)
the camera or the inversion but now that (10:09 - 10:13)
Hannah mentioned that I think I have to (10:11 - 10:15)
toggle that to fix it yeah so you are (10:13 - 10:17)
you boting jumping gliding flying and (10:15 - 10:21)
then plummeting into the ground (10:17 - 10:21)
straight (10:21 - 10:26)
yep or there's like AIG that's like nah (10:23 - 10:28)
you're not flying you're going to bump (10:26 - 10:29)
into me and you're going to crash are (10:28 - 10:31)
surprisingly tall I never noticed that (10:29 - 10:35)
until until you can fly they are very (10:31 - 10:39)
tall um yeah like I said I think I think (10:35 - 10:40)
it's cool that the flying is there (10:39 - 10:43)
there's no surprise that it's like later (10:40 - 10:45)
in the game because that's how most (10:43 - 10:47)
games do flying is like we want you to (10:45 - 10:50)
walk forever before you get it um I (10:47 - 10:53)
think yes I I think I I'm fine with it (10:50 - 10:54)
being kind of late in the game like I (10:53 - 10:56)
think I'm fine with it being postgame it (10:54 - 11:00)
does feel to me a little bit iy to have (10:56 - 11:02)
it in the paid DLC like you cannot get (11:00 - 11:04)
this if you don't pay for the DLC cuz (11:02 - 11:06)
you have to go through that story and (11:04 - 11:08)
that that just feels a little bit icky (11:06 - 11:11)
to me you know like that's not (11:08 - 11:14)
great yeah it does feel it does feel (11:11 - 11:16)
like this would have been an ultra (11:14 - 11:17)
feature right like if you're just (11:16 - 11:19)
thinking like Ultra Sun Ultra moon this (11:17 - 11:21)
would be like well I guess they did (11:19 - 11:23)
actually do that in Ultra it was called (11:21 - 11:25)
Ultra warm holes you want to fly they (11:23 - 11:27)
did that yeah but that was only in one (11:25 - 11:31)
very specific place (11:27 - 11:35)
um yeah speaking of uh flying and (11:31 - 11:38)
running into fph can we talk about the (11:35 - 11:40)
the biomes real quick we're going to be (11:38 - 11:42)
all over the place for this DLC uh or (11:40 - 11:43)
for this this conversation because (11:42 - 11:45)
there's just like features we are (11:43 - 11:48)
talking about um and I don't know if any (11:45 - 11:49)
feature is more important than the other (11:48 - 11:53)
I guess you know debatable on like what (11:49 - 11:55)
you like in Pokemon but let's talk about (11:53 - 11:59)
the Dome the the Terra Dome uh Hannah (11:55 - 12:01)
what is your favorite biome of the ter I (11:59 - 12:03)
think that's aan asked to you I think (12:01 - 12:05)
the game will ask you what your favorite (12:03 - 12:07)
I think it does at some point (12:05 - 12:10)
askor Lacy I'll ask it for (12:07 - 12:14)
you maybe that would that would require (12:10 - 12:17)
actually reading the text but yeah I (12:14 - 12:20)
think in the terrarium I like the music (12:17 - 12:24)
in the coastal biome but I I like the (12:20 - 12:27)
actual biome of the um the cavernous (12:24 - 12:30)
Rocky one I'm forgetting the name of it (12:27 - 12:35)
oh uh oh it's at the tip of my (12:30 - 12:38)
tongue the the one with the amaris's one (12:35 - 12:40)
yeah (12:38 - 12:43)
yeah I immediately entered that and I (12:40 - 12:46)
mean and it's amaris's biome so it makes (12:43 - 12:48)
sense but when I first entered it when I (12:46 - 12:50)
was first playing through and getting to (12:48 - 12:52)
know the biomes my immediate reaction (12:50 - 12:56)
was I can't wait to fly around here just (12:52 - 12:57)
because that one there is so many kind (12:56 - 13:01)
of twists and turns and lifts to fly (12:57 - 13:05)
through so very fitting there okay so uh (13:01 - 13:08)
there's like a there's like a an Easter (13:05 - 13:10)
egg in that biome this is like not a (13:08 - 13:12)
spoiler this is just like understanding (13:10 - 13:14)
how a map (13:12 - 13:18)
Works um so south of amaris's trial (13:14 - 13:21)
there's uh like a a a cliff Plateau that (13:18 - 13:24)
you can like land on uh for the audio (13:21 - 13:26)
for people Hannah and Al both shook (13:24 - 13:27)
their head they know exactly what I'm (13:26 - 13:30)
about to say and in that in that biome (13:27 - 13:31)
that's where you find like the fossil (13:30 - 13:34)
Pokemon uh and there's also like Altaria (13:31 - 13:37)
there and some other stuff but there's (13:34 - 13:39)
uh there's (13:37 - 13:42)
a brilliant what they you (13:39 - 13:45)
brilliant uh not brilliant what are they (13:42 - 13:47)
call the ter the Tera the Tera there's a (13:45 - 13:51)
tera haxus and if you do get flying and (13:47 - 13:53)
you go up and you look down and then you (13:51 - 13:57)
go Google search the Nature Preserve in (13:53 - 14:00)
black two white two it's the (13:57 - 14:04)
same map or it's exactly the same it's (14:00 - 14:06)
exactly the same with the trees and like (14:04 - 14:08)
the the the ground area and the little (14:06 - 14:11)
water thing and the haxus and the haxus (14:08 - 14:13)
yeah that the haxus is the big dead (14:11 - 14:15)
giveaway and it feels like that it feels (14:13 - 14:18)
like the Nature Preserve in 3D and (14:15 - 14:21)
surprisingly the trees look pretty good (14:18 - 14:23)
there I know you know we're always on (14:21 - 14:25)
tree watch on this podcast ever since (14:23 - 14:28)
the those darn games of sword and shield (14:25 - 14:30)
we got to be on tree watch tree watch (14:28 - 14:33)
but that area genuinely looks good like (14:30 - 14:39)
I I'm afraid to say that this DLC is (14:33 - 14:42)
pretty because I know come for you Steve (14:39 - 14:43)
I know they're gonna come for me but (14:42 - 14:45)
like (14:43 - 14:49)
compared wait low standard compared to (14:45 - 14:54)
Pala it does and kakami yes like kakami (14:49 - 14:57)
I feel like is very very green and brown (14:54 - 15:00)
and Pala feels very very I don't know (14:57 - 15:01)
orangey to me just because of all the (15:00 - 15:04)
mountains and stuff but like this game (15:01 - 15:06)
like there was a point I was standing in (15:04 - 15:08)
the coastal region and I like there was (15:06 - 15:10)
like palm trees and then there was like (15:08 - 15:12)
a waterfall coming out of the mountain (15:10 - 15:13)
and then there was like these bushes and (15:12 - 15:15)
flowers and then behind that you could (15:13 - 15:17)
see like the polar ice Scapes and I was (15:15 - 15:20)
like there's just so much color here (15:17 - 15:22)
there's a lot of color because the (15:20 - 15:25)
biomes are all in one place and because (15:22 - 15:27)
there are a lot of different kinds of (15:25 - 15:30)
trees in the Terraria (15:27 - 15:33)
and so I also walked in and I can say (15:30 - 15:34)
that I think it's pretty because I have (15:33 - 15:36)
low standards for game (15:34 - 15:39)
visuals I only really play Pokemon games (15:36 - 15:41)
for the most part I think that this (15:39 - 15:45)
looks really uh good at least (15:41 - 15:46)
comparatively (15:45 - 15:49)
um look I like I like to Legends looked (15:46 - 15:52)
right okay so me too yes I also like to (15:49 - 15:55)
Legends I did not like how Legends work (15:52 - 15:56)
just because of the colors yeah and this (15:55 - 15:58)
isn't just like I I thought it looked (15:56 - 16:01)
good compared to things or or relative (15:58 - 16:03)
to other thing like I I thought it (16:01 - 16:06)
looked a really good game I I liked how (16:03 - 16:08)
everything looked in that game but we're (16:06 - 16:10)
not here to talk about (16:08 - 16:10)
Legends I like going along the the the (16:11 - 16:19)
the border between the biomes um ah I (16:15 - 16:21)
find that satisfying somehow I'm not (16:19 - 16:23)
sure why or what the point is cuz like (16:21 - 16:26)
not many Pokemon spawn near them you (16:23 - 16:27)
might know the answer one of you might (16:26 - 16:31)
know the answer d blocks spawn in that (16:27 - 16:34)
wall I have not found one in that wall (16:31 - 16:36)
I've never yeah I've done the ditto (16:34 - 16:39)
thing 12 times I've never found them (16:36 - 16:42)
against the walls that's a relief (16:39 - 16:44)
they've been on Bridges and on little (16:42 - 16:45)
structures and stuff like that but yeah (16:44 - 16:47)
I've not sent them there (16:45 - 16:50)
either um going back to like the Nature (16:47 - 16:52)
Preserve uh (16:50 - 16:57)
obviously the blueberry Academy is in (16:52 - 16:59)
Unova oh yes (16:57 - 17:03)
they make that very clear now I don't (16:59 - 17:04)
think anyone has to be a rocket (17:03 - 17:06)
scientist (17:04 - 17:09)
to like kind of figure out what's (17:06 - 17:12)
happening outside of this game let me (17:09 - 17:15)
lay this out for you if you need help uh (17:12 - 17:19)
they've remade generation one twice that (17:15 - 17:21)
would be fire red leaf green and let's (17:19 - 17:24)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee and they've (17:21 - 17:27)
remade uh Johto heartold Soul Silver and (17:24 - 17:29)
they've remade Ruby and Sapphire Omega (17:27 - 17:31)
Ruby Alpha SA or Omega Ruby Alpha (17:29 - 17:35)
Sapphire and then we got Gen 4 remakes (17:31 - 17:38)
two years ago the everyone loves them (17:35 - 17:39)
brilliant Diamond shining (17:38 - 17:42)
Pearl the the hit game (17:39 - 17:46)
right I don't think any and legends I (17:42 - 17:49)
guess technically I don't think anyone (17:46 - 17:51)
thinks well maybe maybe some people like (17:49 - 17:54)
gen five is just next it's always been (17:51 - 17:55)
next whether or not the blueberry (17:54 - 17:59)
Academy exists like I don't think (17:55 - 18:01)
they'll just ah let's skip the Gen five (17:59 - 18:04)
go right to gen six and seven like I (18:01 - 18:06)
don't know if they're going to skip it (18:04 - 18:08)
but I do feel like they're starting to (18:06 - 18:12)
do different things in the newer games (18:08 - 18:14)
and I kind of feel like especially with (18:12 - 18:16)
the way the anime was kind of going (18:14 - 18:18)
right there at the end before the new (18:16 - 18:21)
one maybe they'll just start to merge (18:18 - 18:23)
them and have more than one region in (18:21 - 18:25)
every game from now on since technically (18:23 - 18:28)
there are three regions in this game now (18:25 - 18:30)
yeah with (18:28 - 18:33)
kakami I don't think they like I don't (18:30 - 18:35)
know if ilka like I guess the the real (18:33 - 18:38)
question is like who's making a possible (18:35 - 18:40)
gen five remake is that Ila is that game (18:38 - 18:45)
freak is that like more Omega Ruby where (18:40 - 18:47)
it's like we're going to take artistic (18:45 - 18:50)
Liberties Liberty or is it going to be (18:47 - 18:52)
more like bdsp is we're going to make a (18:50 - 18:53)
faithful remake except all of these (18:52 - 18:55)
parts are not faithful but these parts (18:53 - 18:58)
are like I'd be curious like I guess (18:55 - 18:59)
we're not going to spend the episode (18:58 - 19:02)
talking about that but like I I I guess (18:59 - 19:03)
the point I'm making is just because (19:02 - 19:06)
there's a bunch of Unova references here (19:03 - 19:11)
doesn't separate that like Unova is next (19:06 - 19:13)
anyways also like Pokemon games just (19:11 - 19:16)
reference a lot of well there's there's (19:13 - 19:18)
a lion king reference in this game now (19:16 - 19:20)
so like I don't think they're making (19:18 - 19:22)
Lion King so I think yeah there are lots (19:20 - 19:24)
of references one in particular that I (19:22 - 19:28)
suspect we're not going to mention uh (19:24 - 19:29)
but there's lots of just because it's a (19:28 - 19:31)
spoiler around things but there's lots (19:29 - 19:33)
of different (19:31 - 19:36)
references yeah a lot of Gen 5 ones in (19:33 - 19:37)
particular but there are other ones as (19:36 - 19:41)
well yeah in the coastal biome uh it's (19:37 - 19:45)
uh the drift Veil music remixed in a (19:41 - 19:46)
coastal (19:45 - 19:49)
way yeah I mean there is there is Unova (19:46 - 19:52)
music all over this entire (19:49 - 19:56)
DLC yeah and even in like uh the club (19:52 - 20:00)
room you uh it's just like I I guess I (19:56 - 20:02)
have like the luxury of like playing in (20:00 - 20:04)
front of hundreds of people but when I (20:02 - 20:07)
changed the club room to the futuristic (20:04 - 20:10)
style I like instantly knew it was Poke (20:07 - 20:15)
star Studios ah and and on the there's (20:10 - 20:17)
like your instead of a TV you have like (20:15 - 20:19)
a command center because it's supposed (20:17 - 20:20)
to be Poké star Studios and on the (20:19 - 20:23)
command center is like a giant like UFO (20:20 - 20:27)
almost silon like creature and my twitch (20:23 - 20:29)
chat was like oh is that a new Paradox (20:27 - 20:31)
Pokemon I was like nope that's a giant (20:29 - 20:34)
UFO that you fight in Pok star Studios (20:31 - 20:37)
which like all of like 20 people in the (20:34 - 20:39)
entire world did because everyone else (20:37 - 20:42)
avoided poke star Studios I I certainly (20:39 - 20:46)
did yep I'm not getting the the Gen 5 (20:42 - 20:47)
references as much until I see them (20:46 - 20:50)
online because Gen 5 was like my first (20:47 - 20:53)
gen back after you know everyone (20:50 - 20:54)
certainly our ages had that period of (20:53 - 20:56)
time where you weren't playing Pokémon (20:54 - 20:58)
Gen 5 was my first one back so I wasn't (20:56 - 21:00)
really playing it as much as I then (20:58 - 21:03)
played five and sorry six and seven but (21:00 - 21:04)
yeah it's fun to see people post about (21:03 - 21:06)
them did either of you look at the map (21:04 - 21:08)
before you defeated the gym leaders and (21:06 - 21:10)
scroll through the descriptions of each (21:08 - 21:14)
of the gym leaders yeah because each of (21:10 - 21:17)
them had a city that they were from oh (21:14 - 21:20)
yeah well I guess from cities in yova I (21:17 - 21:23)
guess that makes sense because like the (21:20 - 21:25)
biome is a (21:23 - 21:27)
school yeah yeah so like they couldn't (21:25 - 21:30)
be born in the may maybe they you know I (21:27 - 21:32)
don't what Happ the teach room none of (21:30 - 21:36)
the adults so in blueberry Academy all (21:32 - 21:37)
of the students are young adults and (21:36 - 21:40)
children which is different from in Palo (21:37 - 21:41)
where they're actually adult students (21:40 - 21:43)
and I'm actually kind of sad about that (21:41 - 21:45)
difference oh like when you're like (21:43 - 21:47)
walking in Pala and you get like Grandpa (21:45 - 21:49)
and he's like I just passed my test here (21:47 - 21:50)
let's (21:49 - 21:53)
battle I like that in there I was sad (21:50 - 21:54)
that blueberry Academy didn't have any (21:53 - 21:57)
adult students so blueberry Academy is a (21:54 - 21:59)
standard School whereas the one in paa (21:57 - 22:01)
are more like a college where you've you (21:59 - 22:04)
can go back to it when you're older well (22:01 - 22:06)
I mean I think like it's you know really (22:04 - 22:08)
accurate you know you if you're not in (22:06 - 22:09)
school you're already joining the (22:08 - 22:12)
workforce in America so you know Fair (22:09 - 22:15)
Point capitalism starts as soon as (22:12 - 22:19)
education stops it does make me question (22:15 - 22:22)
because I need to know (22:19 - 22:24)
um that's probably close too close to (22:22 - 22:26)
story stuff although it's not something (22:24 - 22:28)
that was mentioned it's a lack of (22:26 - 22:29)
something but the lack of Something's (22:28 - 22:32)
probably still a spoiler right okay well (22:29 - 22:34)
then back to the map and back to the (22:32 - 22:36)
descriptions of the gym leaders did you (22:34 - 22:38)
to notice that there were numbers that (22:36 - 22:40)
they actually straight up numbered them (22:38 - 22:41)
this time to tell you which of the gym (22:40 - 22:43)
leaders sorry they're not Gym Leaders (22:41 - 22:46)
elite four members they feel like Gym (22:43 - 22:48)
Leaders which of them was hardest and (22:46 - 22:50)
which one of them was e easiest because (22:48 - 22:53)
they actually told us this time purely (22:50 - 22:56)
why I brought Al back because Al and I (22:53 - 22:59)
had a huge argument a year ago about a (22:56 - 23:03)
specific order and I said Al if if you (22:59 - 23:05)
or if you hovered over the gym leaders (23:03 - 23:07)
in Pala it would technically tell you (23:05 - 23:10)
the order well and then Al was like who (23:07 - 23:13)
needs to read which is a good point very (23:10 - 23:15)
good point um look of all the people in (23:13 - 23:17)
the world of all the people in the world (23:15 - 23:19)
to accuse me of not reading I don't (23:17 - 23:21)
think you're the one to do it Steve but (23:19 - 23:25)
I will say right I will say having known (23:21 - 23:27)
that this would be the case right (23:25 - 23:28)
because obviously you know we had that (23:27 - 23:30)
discussion and I then knew afterwards (23:28 - 23:32)
that there was this description I still (23:30 - 23:33)
did not click on them and look at the (23:32 - 23:35)
description cuz I forgot they had lital (23:33 - 23:38)
numbers in there this time it wasn't (23:35 - 23:41)
even just the text hinting at which one (23:38 - 23:43)
was easiest there were numbers there was (23:41 - 23:45)
a ranking there there is a big (23:43 - 23:46)
difference here though right because (23:45 - 23:48)
like what is difficulty when they're all (23:46 - 23:50)
roughly the same level right like we're (23:48 - 23:53)
coming post game and it's a lot of it is (23:50 - 23:56)
to do with how well you prepared for (23:53 - 23:58)
that like I only lost to one of them and (23:56 - 24:01)
it wasn't the hardest one I'm guessing (23:58 - 24:03)
hardest one however you want to describe (24:01 - 24:05)
that the one that was listed as the (24:03 - 24:07)
hardest one on there I (24:05 - 24:09)
suspect uh yeah so they're they're (24:07 - 24:11)
they're in order uh well not order (24:09 - 24:13)
they're in like ranking it makes sense (24:11 - 24:16)
and this this also makes sense in the (24:13 - 24:19)
sense like they actually talk about the (24:16 - 24:22)
ranking also at some point which is like (24:19 - 24:23)
actually really interesting and cool of (24:22 - 24:26)
like how the Elite 4 actually (24:23 - 24:29)
works which is like a a neat little (24:26 - 24:32)
tidbit but like they say like crisen is (24:29 - 24:34)
that's his name kisen he's number five (24:32 - 24:36)
and then amoris is number four and (24:34 - 24:38)
Lacy's number two and then Drayton is (24:36 - 24:41)
number one and then obviously Kieran is (24:38 - 24:42)
the champion there there's there there's (24:41 - 24:44)
no spoilers there that's like the (24:42 - 24:45)
literally the like five seconds of the (24:44 - 24:47)
game they're like by the way this dude's (24:45 - 24:52)
Champion so uh they they I I guess (24:47 - 24:54)
there's it would kind of be silly for (24:52 - 24:57)
them to like sugarcoat that or like like (24:54 - 24:59)
who's the champion then they like tell (24:57 - 25:01)
you right away um that's like the (24:59 - 25:04)
opening of the game uh they there there (25:01 - 25:05)
side note side note before I get (25:04 - 25:07)
completely distracted you have to beat (25:05 - 25:11)
the teal mask to do this game and (25:07 - 25:14)
obviously the Pala stuff but you can (25:11 - 25:17)
still access the blueberry Academy you (25:14 - 25:20)
just you won't I think what the what (25:17 - 25:25)
cuts it is uh when you when you meet (25:20 - 25:26)
Carmine for the first time you battle (25:25 - 25:29)
her and then then the story actually (25:26 - 25:31)
like kicks off so if you don't finish (25:29 - 25:34)
the teal mask you don't get that initial (25:31 - 25:36)
battle with Carmine because after that (25:34 - 25:38)
battle with Carmine the story will (25:36 - 25:42)
start so like lacy will be because I had (25:38 - 25:44)
expected that you just would never get (25:42 - 25:45)
the call to say that you're going to (25:44 - 25:47)
Blueberry Academy until after that that (25:45 - 25:49)
is how IID assumed they would do that (25:47 - 25:51)
from my understanding you can still go (25:49 - 25:55)
to the area but like the story and (25:51 - 25:57)
progression of the Elite 4 is completely (25:55 - 25:59)
halted because of that initial carine (25:57 - 26:02)
battle that starts the the thing I mean (25:59 - 26:04)
that's how they did crry Tundra as well (26:02 - 26:05)
you could go there and you could even do (26:04 - 26:07)
the legendary hunting then but you (26:05 - 26:08)
couldn't you couldn't do the actual (26:07 - 26:12)
story there's also if you when you first (26:08 - 26:14)
walk through the blueberry (26:12 - 26:17)
Academy um into the Dome I should say (26:14 - 26:21)
you might see perin there depending if (26:17 - 26:24)
you did the teal mask like parin is (26:21 - 26:27)
completely optional in the teal mask so (26:24 - 26:29)
either if you did her stuff she's going (26:27 - 26:30)
to be standing right there when you walk (26:29 - 26:33)
through the door and if you didn't do (26:30 - 26:35)
her Quest she's not standing there (26:33 - 26:37)
interesting that's because she's still (26:35 - 26:39)
back in kitami presumably yeah yeah she (26:37 - 26:42)
hasn't left yet interesting um so (26:39 - 26:43)
there's like a lot of little things like (26:42 - 26:45)
that (26:43 - 26:48)
of like these two DLCs are pretty (26:45 - 26:52)
closely intertwined whereas like I don't (26:48 - 26:55)
don't think the crown Tundra and the the (26:52 - 26:58)
aisle of armor were that no see that's (26:55 - 26:59)
this is an interesting one cuz like you (26:58 - 27:01)
know people I know that some people had (26:59 - 27:02)
an issue with the tail mask and they (27:01 - 27:04)
said that there wasn't it wasn't very (27:02 - 27:06)
long there wasn't a huge amount of story (27:04 - 27:08)
um and I find that interesting because (27:06 - 27:11)
like I don't really feel like the Isle (27:08 - 27:13)
of armor had much story either and the (27:11 - 27:15)
crown thundra didn't really it was more (27:13 - 27:17)
just like here's a small it was one of (27:15 - 27:18)
the like legendary hunting stories right (27:17 - 27:21)
it was here's a little bit to justify (27:18 - 27:22)
the fact that you're getting this (27:21 - 27:23)
legendary and I felt like that was all (27:22 - 27:25)
there was in those whereas these there (27:23 - 27:28)
actually is a story yeah this game is is (27:25 - 27:29)
much more story focused but we're not (27:28 - 27:31)
talking about that today and I was way (27:29 - 27:34)
too easily go you're stressing Hannah (27:31 - 27:37)
out cuz she wants to talk about it so (27:34 - 27:39)
bad (27:37 - 27:42)
um yeah let's let's like kind of just (27:39 - 27:44)
run (27:42 - 27:48)
through the the just before you do I did (27:44 - 27:50)
I I tested if you don't have flying (27:48 - 27:53)
unlocked the gliding is still bad so the (27:50 - 27:56)
glading is fixed by getting the flying (27:53 - 27:59)
oh oh in your other game (27:56 - 28:02)
yeah okay got it okay sorry just felt (27:59 - 28:03)
the need to say that before I forgot (28:02 - 28:05)
again I'm sure the listeners would be (28:03 - 28:06)
shouting at it if I didn't see it so (28:05 - 28:09)
there we go uh so just in I'll put a (28:06 - 28:11)
little spoiler warning here we're going (28:09 - 28:12)
to talk about the Elite 4 not (28:11 - 28:15)
specifically their um personalities or (28:12 - 28:19)
whatever or what or whatnot but I I just (28:15 - 28:20)
want to talk about the mechanics mostly (28:19 - 28:21)
before the Elite (28:20 - 28:24)
4 uh because I think those are (28:21 - 28:26)
interesting (28:24 - 28:30)
um in the past you know an Elite 4 was (28:26 - 28:33)
you know very red (28:30 - 28:36)
blue gold silver Ruby Sapphire you just (28:33 - 28:39)
walk into a room battle four people in a (28:36 - 28:42)
row no healing in between unless you (28:39 - 28:44)
brought a million potions and then you (28:42 - 28:46)
battle your (28:44 - 28:47)
Champion I don't know why I didn't (28:46 - 28:48)
include Diamond and Pearl that's the (28:47 - 28:51)
same there in gen five they decided to (28:48 - 28:55)
uh you can pick whichever one you want (28:51 - 28:57)
that's when they changed that um they (28:55 - 28:59)
were all roughly the same (28:57 - 29:02)
level uh I always went like left to (28:59 - 29:04)
right anyways because I I was like I (29:02 - 29:05)
don't know I got to battle them all (29:04 - 29:08)
anyways I think that the the ver the (29:05 - 29:11)
order might be nice in case you were (29:08 - 29:13)
struggling with a certain one you could (29:11 - 29:15)
like technically (29:13 - 29:18)
grind experience on another (29:15 - 29:21)
one like that's probably like battling (29:18 - 29:23)
Elite 4 over and over and just grinding (29:21 - 29:25)
money and experience so you could like I (29:23 - 29:27)
just remember in red and blue of like I (29:25 - 29:29)
would always get to like Lance and then (29:27 - 29:31)
lose like because I was like a dumb (29:29 - 29:32)
10-year-old right and so it was like (29:31 - 29:34)
well at least I'm leveling up because I (29:32 - 29:35)
can beat the first three just fine I (29:34 - 29:37)
always lose to Lance but like I'm (29:35 - 29:39)
getting at least one to two levels every (29:37 - 29:40)
time I go through and I remember the (29:39 - 29:42)
very first time beating Lance and then (29:40 - 29:43)
being like I did it I beat the game and (29:42 - 29:44)
then all of a sudden there's like (29:43 - 29:46)
another blue is there and you're like oh (29:44 - 29:47)
I didn't know there was like a fifth (29:46 - 29:49)
he's at Elite Four why is there another (29:47 - 29:53)
person um so like I I totally get the (29:49 - 29:55)
you know pick any order I don't know if (29:53 - 29:57)
that dramatically made that experience (29:55 - 29:59)
better cuz I was an adult when black and (29:57 - 30:01)
white came out and then X and Y did the (29:59 - 30:04)
same thing you can pick any order and (30:01 - 30:06)
then sun and moon you can pick any (30:04 - 30:10)
order Galler was the tournament so I (30:06 - 30:14)
guess it went back from not picking (30:10 - 30:17)
any caller doesn't have an Elite (30:14 - 30:21)
4 uh and then Pala kind of had the (30:17 - 30:23)
traditional battle I mean it does it has (30:21 - 30:26)
the traditional go through the rooms so (30:23 - 30:29)
this is any order (30:26 - 30:32)
except they tell you which you should (30:29 - 30:35)
technically do but also there's uh (30:32 - 30:38)
there's the alola you got to do a trial (30:35 - 30:40)
beforehand (30:38 - 30:45)
so I will say this is what I think I (30:40 - 30:47)
think (30:45 - 30:52)
mechanically crispin's trial is so (30:47 - 30:56)
cool yes I agree like I don't think it's (30:52 - 30:59)
perfect but it's it's Unique in the way (30:56 - 31:02)
of like oh I have to think about this (30:59 - 31:04)
for a (31:02 - 31:07)
second it's very it's it's kind of (31:04 - 31:09)
similar to like I guess blaines of like (31:07 - 31:12)
a little quiz show so I thought it was (31:09 - 31:13)
interesting to start with right when he (31:12 - 31:15)
was like oh you have to make me a spicy (31:13 - 31:16)
sandwich and I was like oh cool and then (31:15 - 31:18)
he says but you have to get it by (31:16 - 31:20)
bargaining with the other people and I (31:18 - 31:23)
saw them all and that's when I sighed (31:20 - 31:25)
and I rolled my eyes and I went oh for (31:23 - 31:27)
goodness sake and it's like do you have (31:25 - 31:30)
to think about it I guess technically (31:27 - 31:32)
but if you just do all of the things you (31:30 - 31:34)
will get the right stuff unless you (31:32 - 31:36)
accidentally ask for ketchup rather than (31:34 - 31:38)
chili sauce yeah unless you ask for the (31:36 - 31:40)
wrong one or unless you go in the wrong (31:38 - 31:42)
direction or unless you trade back on (31:40 - 31:44)
accident you have to figure it out but (31:42 - 31:46)
if you go the wrong direction you just (31:44 - 31:47)
then go the other direction and do the (31:46 - 31:49)
other things right it's not it's not a (31:47 - 31:51)
real puzzle right it's just like you've (31:49 - 31:53)
got a few things to do and it's like (31:51 - 31:55)
even if you do forget even if you do ask (31:53 - 31:57)
for ketchup rather than chili sauce (31:55 - 31:58)
there's another person that gives you (31:57 - 32:00)
chili CHS hidden behind a rock right (31:58 - 32:02)
like it's you're telling me that you (32:00 - 32:04)
know how to make mayo because at one (32:02 - 32:05)
point they're like what are the (32:04 - 32:07)
ingredients for mayo and I'm like I'm (32:05 - 32:09)
not actually it was the other thing it (32:07 - 32:11)
was what do these three ingredients make (32:09 - 32:13)
and I had no idea have you never made (32:11 - 32:16)
Meo before it was like it was like (32:13 - 32:18)
something about potato salad which I was (32:16 - 32:19)
like I don't know there's also an (32:18 - 32:21)
ingredient what was like bruda or (32:19 - 32:22)
something I was like I don't even know (32:21 - 32:25)
what that is I think it was the they it (32:22 - 32:28)
was cherito but they named it in (32:25 - 32:30)
uh Spanish rather than English in no (32:28 - 32:32)
they have tho and then they have Pudo (32:30 - 32:34)
those are two different things no no I (32:32 - 32:36)
no I know that that's not what I'm (32:34 - 32:38)
saying Han what I'm saying (32:36 - 32:41)
is the item was charito but when they (32:38 - 32:44)
said we've got this thing they used a (32:41 - 32:46)
slightly it was like charit on or some (32:44 - 32:48)
something slightly different and I'm (32:46 - 32:49)
pretty sure that was in Spanish rather (32:48 - 32:51)
than English I'm not trying to say the (32:49 - 32:54)
Bruto and were the same (32:51 - 32:57)
thing thank you there was also a dude (32:54 - 32:59)
behind behind a rock who is like if you (32:57 - 33:01)
just give me 50 BP you don't have to (32:59 - 33:03)
battle me and I thought that was so (33:01 - 33:07)
funny and I I think most people did that (33:03 - 33:09)
I would love to see like the statistics (33:07 - 33:11)
like if like there's no way game freak (33:09 - 33:13)
doesn't know like how many times you (33:11 - 33:14)
know somebody has done this trial right (33:13 - 33:16)
how many people have bought the DLC but (33:14 - 33:18)
how many people have beat the DLC there (33:16 - 33:20)
has to be like an indicator of like how (33:18 - 33:22)
many people actually took this guy up on (33:20 - 33:25)
the battle because everyone I talked to (33:22 - 33:28)
paid him 50 BP to skip that (33:25 - 33:31)
battle but I thought that but I was (33:28 - 33:33)
actually impressed with the battles like (33:31 - 33:37)
one of the people had uh what was it (33:33 - 33:41)
like a Flygon and uh like electros I (33:37 - 33:43)
think or something I can't remember (33:41 - 33:45)
exactly but it was like one was spamming (33:43 - 33:49)
earthquake and to hit both your Pokemon (33:45 - 33:50)
and then it couldn't hit the one that (33:49 - 33:52)
was levitating and then the the the (33:50 - 33:54)
electros was hitting discharge which (33:52 - 33:56)
didn't hit the ground Pokemon standing (33:54 - 33:57)
next to it and then it hit both your (33:56 - 33:58)
Pokemon (33:57 - 34:00)
like there was like every battle in (33:58 - 34:02)
crisen like minions or whatever they (34:00 - 34:06)
were was was like an a clever double (34:02 - 34:09)
battle gimmick like if anything you (34:06 - 34:10)
could be like oh I didn't know that (34:09 - 34:12)
these two Pokemon interact I think the (34:10 - 34:14)
only ones that were bad was like the two (34:12 - 34:16)
pyrs but I think there was I think both (34:14 - 34:18)
of them benefited technically from like (34:16 - 34:21)
hyper voice because no not is it hyper (34:18 - 34:22)
voice or is it there's like a move where (34:21 - 34:24)
like if you keep if two Pokemon use it (34:22 - 34:26)
they like both get stronger I can't (34:24 - 34:28)
remember p is just a bad Pokemon so (34:26 - 34:29)
there's no way that was going to work (34:28 - 34:32)
anyways (34:29 - 34:32)
wow yeah I know it wasn't just the Lite (34:32 - 34:38)
4S people who were in their gyms it was (34:35 - 34:40)
any trainer out there this was very much (34:38 - 34:42)
a battle focused school there were (34:40 - 34:45)
random NPCs around the map with battle (34:42 - 34:48)
focused items and strategies it was not (34:45 - 34:51)
necessarily that they were hard but they (34:48 - 34:53)
all had strategy built (34:51 - 34:57)
in yeah I have yet to battle an NPC in (34:53 - 35:01)
this game game that wasn't like a (34:57 - 35:01)
requirement I went and battled someone I (35:02 - 35:06)
was just stressed about moving forward (35:04 - 35:09)
with the story more because I was too (35:06 - 35:11)
excited (35:09 - 35:13)
but other than that I've only battled a (35:11 - 35:15)
few so (35:13 - 35:17)
yeah I do think having the double (35:15 - 35:20)
battles does allow for more interesting (35:17 - 35:22)
things you know as Hannah said I don't (35:20 - 35:24)
think any of them were particularly (35:22 - 35:26)
difficult but as has been mentioned many (35:24 - 35:28)
a time before (35:26 - 35:29)
right that's because we'd know how (35:28 - 35:32)
Pokemon works right like and you know if (35:29 - 35:33)
you go in with the right things you can (35:32 - 35:37)
still always always defeat it yeah yeah (35:33 - 35:41)
there like the whole Elite 4 was around (35:37 - 35:46)
like 77 to like 82 or something like (35:41 - 35:47)
that like there's like only like a five (35:46 - 35:51)
level difference in between all of them (35:47 - 35:53)
or whatnot I actually think like the (35:51 - 35:55)
minions you fought for crisen they were (35:53 - 35:57)
like like low 70s (35:55 - 36:00)
like they and I think the same for Dron (35:57 - 36:03)
were a little bit lower um but the elite (36:00 - 36:05)
for members were all the same so you go (36:03 - 36:08)
from like crispin's trial (36:05 - 36:12)
which pretty unique I think to like (36:08 - 36:14)
amaris's trial which I already like knew (36:12 - 36:15)
but I think well everyone knew Amor's (36:14 - 36:17)
trial but I was like I already did this (36:15 - 36:18)
I doubt it's going to be different it (36:17 - 36:20)
wasn't it was the (36:18 - 36:26)
same I I I feel like it's the the trial (36:20 - 36:27)
itself isn't hard it's like whether you (36:26 - 36:31)
like inverted controls or camera is like (36:27 - 36:34)
hard um with okay wait real quick going (36:31 - 36:36)
back to chrisen there is multiple ways (36:34 - 36:39)
to like win uh like some people so that (36:36 - 36:40)
would be my question like how much do (36:39 - 36:41)
you have to have to make it spicy does (36:40 - 36:43)
it just have to be a little bit spicy CU (36:41 - 36:45)
like I put I threw everything on there (36:43 - 36:47)
right and he his fire was coming out of (36:45 - 36:49)
his ears you know it was but like how (36:47 - 36:52)
spicy is spicy that's the question yeah (36:49 - 36:54)
I'm not sure I I still had Mayo as an (36:52 - 36:57)
ingredient and I don't right think Mayo (36:54 - 36:59)
is spicy but I was like I guess I'll put (36:57 - 37:02)
it on and I succeeded with like mayo and (36:59 - 37:04)
then some people told me they didn't use (37:02 - 37:06)
mayo and then some people were like oh I (37:04 - 37:08)
didn't have this ingredient or like I (37:06 - 37:10)
had ketchup and it still worked and then (37:08 - 37:12)
some people were like oh I got it wrong (37:10 - 37:14)
so if you get it wrong he tells you it's (37:12 - 37:18)
not spicy and you go back into the world (37:14 - 37:20)
you still have all your ingredients but (37:18 - 37:22)
you can then continue trading if you (37:20 - 37:24)
want right so like you don't have to (37:22 - 37:26)
start completely over but you do you (37:24 - 37:29)
have to make a spicy sandwich yeah cuz (37:26 - 37:30)
cuz I guess my question is like can you (37:29 - 37:31)
go to that guy who's behind the rock pay (37:30 - 37:34)
50 Battle Points get the one spicy (37:31 - 37:35)
ingredient he has just make the sandwich (37:34 - 37:38)
with that would that count my guess (37:35 - 37:40)
would be my guess would be yes from (37:38 - 37:42)
doing a bunch of the sandwich (37:40 - 37:46)
BBQ's it seems like it goes off of what (37:42 - 37:49)
the majority flavor is so if there is (37:46 - 37:50)
anything spicy there it seems like (37:49 - 37:52)
that's going to be a Spicy sandwich (37:50 - 37:55)
extra spicy that's true fair I wonder I (37:52 - 37:56)
guess in a programming it's probably (37:55 - 38:01)
like chizo plus two ketchup minus one (37:56 - 38:03)
like I'm assuming it's just like a a (38:01 - 38:05)
number threshold you're hitting probably (38:03 - 38:07)
yeah yeah yeah but there isn't there (38:05 - 38:08)
isn't a minimum number of ingredients (38:07 - 38:11)
you have to use but I'm sure (38:08 - 38:12)
speedrunners will be like you need (38:11 - 38:16)
exactly one toizo and one mustard (38:12 - 38:17)
because I think you put mustard on it (38:16 - 38:19)
too yeah I think mustard was one of them (38:17 - 38:22)
mustard was one of them yeah um yeah so (38:19 - 38:24)
there was like multiple ways to like win (38:22 - 38:27)
that to open the battle for (38:24 - 38:30)
there's it's so straightforward it's (38:27 - 38:31)
like I don't think the Rings ever change (38:30 - 38:33)
I don't know what happens if you fail if (38:31 - 38:36)
it like becomes like short or I don't (38:33 - 38:37)
think so because so I've done have you (38:36 - 38:40)
done the other flying tests after doing (38:37 - 38:42)
the the TR the trial no I haven't done (38:40 - 38:44)
like the hard mode flying test yeah so (38:42 - 38:46)
there's there's four there's easy medium (38:44 - 38:50)
hard and super hard um of which only one (38:46 - 38:54)
of them is actually hard the easy is the (38:50 - 38:56)
one that you do for the trial and it's (38:54 - 38:57)
exactly the same when when you do it the (38:56 - 38:59)
second time you have to do it a second (38:57 - 39:00)
time before you unlock (38:59 - 39:03)
the the what did I call it medium Medi I (39:00 - 39:06)
can't remember yeah um so I think it's (39:03 - 39:08)
just the exact same one but I think I'm (39:06 - 39:11)
pretty sure that with the the easy and (39:08 - 39:14)
the medium you can like Miss 90% of the (39:11 - 39:16)
the hoops and still make it in time (39:14 - 39:19)
because they're like so densely packed (39:16 - 39:23)
the Hoops only give you extra time so (39:19 - 39:24)
yeah they give you like plus three (39:23 - 39:27)
seconds yeah but I had like 45 seconds (39:24 - 39:29)
at the end of that trial cuz it just (39:27 - 39:32)
adds up exactly end the trial and I (39:29 - 39:34)
completely missed the goal and I went (39:32 - 39:37)
flying off around in a giant Loop before (39:34 - 39:38)
I was able to finally make it back into (39:37 - 39:39)
the (39:38 - 39:42)
goal whereas the super hard one is like (39:39 - 39:44)
actually difficult if you miss like six (39:42 - 39:45)
or seven of them then you're probably (39:44 - 39:48)
not going to make it in time um and they (39:45 - 39:50)
have they have hoops that give you five (39:48 - 39:53)
seconds instead of three seconds as well (39:50 - 39:55)
oh also uh calm down that you get a fun (39:53 - 39:57)
little fat you get like a fun little (39:55 - 39:59)
dialogue if you don't put the top bun on (39:57 - 40:00)
the sandwich (39:59 - 40:03)
for for (40:00 - 40:05)
Crispen he says something of like oh do (40:03 - 40:08)
they like make sandwiches like this in (40:05 - 40:08)
Pala more sandwich I put the top button (40:10 - 40:15)
on I wanted to make I wanted to impress (40:13 - 40:16)
crisen I wasn't sure if there was going (40:15 - 40:17)
to be like negative points if I didn't (40:16 - 40:18)
do (40:17 - 40:21)
that uh okay and then we get to so like (40:18 - 40:23)
Amor's trial is like just the flying (40:21 - 40:27)
stuff which whatever um and then get to (40:23 - 40:28)
Lacy's trial which I actually think is (40:27 - 40:30)
the worst (40:28 - 40:34)
one I it's just like I can't remember (40:30 - 40:36)
that one maybe that something it's like (40:34 - 40:41)
the quiz one oh yes yeah I I don't know (40:36 - 40:43)
I'm not against quiz stuff like they (40:41 - 40:46)
clemont and X and Y did the quiz stuff (40:43 - 40:50)
uh not Shantel I can't remember her name (40:46 - 40:53)
Fantasia I think is her name and and (40:50 - 40:54)
platinum does the quiz (40:53 - 40:58)
stuff uh or or maybe that's Diamond (40:54 - 40:59)
pearl I can't remember that gym does (40:58 - 41:02)
change at some point um Blaine everyone (40:59 - 41:04)
knows Blaine does the quiz (41:02 - 41:08)
stuff but Lac like lacy did not give me (41:04 - 41:12)
quiz game energy when I met her so her (41:08 - 41:15)
doing like a quiz was like (41:12 - 41:19)
oh yeah I I guess like she kind of gives (41:15 - 41:21)
off a little bit of quiz game energy a (41:19 - 41:23)
little bit of right and wrong get things (41:21 - 41:28)
right that kind of thing but the venonat (41:23 - 41:30)
yeah if you get we talk about the v in (41:28 - 41:32)
that question it was bad if you get it (41:30 - 41:33)
if you get it wrong she just says just (41:32 - 41:36)
try it again right like so it doesn't (41:33 - 41:37)
really fit in with that aspect of things (41:36 - 41:40)
but yeah I I too got the question for (41:37 - 41:42)
the Venom wrong first time I haven't (41:40 - 41:44)
seen anyone get it (41:42 - 41:47)
right well the the the question is like (41:44 - 41:48)
okay the first question is like the (41:47 - 41:51)
Pikachu one I think most people know (41:48 - 41:54)
that and you can like I guess like the (41:51 - 41:56)
the the cute thing about this quiz thing (41:54 - 41:59)
is like you can pick like feet or hands (41:56 - 42:01)
like it really lets you like like hover (41:59 - 42:04)
over like every option so you have to (42:01 - 42:07)
like Pikachu one and like I think most (42:04 - 42:08)
people know that and then skip the (42:07 - 42:10)
second question because that we'll come (42:08 - 42:13)
back to that the third question is the (42:10 - 42:15)
the siny one I (42:13 - 42:18)
think and I think that one is like (42:15 - 42:20)
interesting I think that question is so (42:18 - 42:22)
interesting for no for somebody who this (42:20 - 42:24)
might be their first game or for (42:22 - 42:28)
somebody who just skipped G Al together (42:24 - 42:30)
because nowhere in Pala I feel like they (42:28 - 42:33)
ever talk about siny and like siny being (42:30 - 42:36)
antiqu like that was such a talking (42:33 - 42:40)
point in Galler so like if you play (42:36 - 42:42)
sword and shield like that should be the (42:40 - 42:45)
easiest question in the world but I'm I (42:42 - 42:47)
think that question is like still in (42:45 - 42:49)
like good I think it's still good (42:47 - 42:51)
question (42:49 - 42:53)
for I (42:51 - 42:56)
think because if you don't know and (42:53 - 42:57)
you're just kind of sitting there going (42:56 - 42:58)
oh I don't know and you look at them (42:57 - 43:01)
they all spin around and you see there's (42:58 - 43:03)
a clear difference between the three of (43:01 - 43:04)
them which one is different than the (43:03 - 43:06)
others question exactly exactly so even (43:04 - 43:08)
if you don't know that that's what (43:06 - 43:10)
you're looking for it makes it pretty (43:08 - 43:13)
obvious if you're just looking at them (43:10 - 43:15)
yeah and also for the record you can (43:13 - 43:17)
play sword and shield without knowing (43:15 - 43:19)
the difference between an antique siny (43:17 - 43:21)
or not I didn't know the difference (43:19 - 43:22)
until I saw people really trying to (43:21 - 43:26)
shiny hunt for it um and then the what (43:22 - 43:28)
what is the fourth question the fifth (43:26 - 43:29)
question is the grandbull question which (43:28 - 43:31)
is like really generic of like where do (43:29 - 43:33)
I like to lay on my grand bll and like (43:31 - 43:36)
some random NPC out there like is like (43:33 - 43:37)
lazy likes to lay on the stomach of the (43:36 - 43:39)
gr like who's ever talking to that (43:37 - 43:41)
person I guess I mean it's a pretty (43:39 - 43:42)
obvious answer right you're not going to (43:41 - 43:45)
see the horns right like obviously she (43:42 - 43:48)
want to lie on the tummy like come on (43:45 - 43:52)
I'm going to lay on Gran's (43:48 - 43:55)
jawline it's a very sharp (43:52 - 43:57)
Pokemon what was what was the fourth (43:55 - 44:01)
question the minor oh the minor one yeah (43:57 - 44:04)
yeah that one I thought was a good (44:01 - 44:06)
question until I found out everyone's (44:04 - 44:08)
it's the it's the same answer it's all (44:06 - 44:12)
it's always in the same spot (44:08 - 44:15)
yeah so like it's not even like that (44:12 - 44:17)
like puzzle isn't (44:15 - 44:20)
even like randomized it's just the minor (44:17 - 44:23)
is always going to go to the same spot (44:20 - 44:27)
which is like I don't know it's fun it's (44:23 - 44:30)
fun one time it's fun one time if you (44:27 - 44:33)
have if you've seen it before I mean (44:30 - 44:36)
that's quizzes in general right like I (44:33 - 44:37)
don't think (44:36 - 44:39)
games quizzes and games don't tend to be (44:37 - 44:41)
very good like I found one half decent (44:39 - 44:43)
quiz that I finally found in coral (44:41 - 44:45)
island a game that I will talk about all (44:43 - 44:46)
the time like they have a quiz that's (44:45 - 44:48)
that has like hundreds of questions and (44:46 - 44:50)
they're randomized so you can play that (44:48 - 44:52)
many many times and have completely (44:50 - 44:55)
different ones um but yeah it's very (44:52 - 44:57)
hard to do that (44:55 - 45:00)
that yeah so going back okay so the (44:57 - 45:01)
question two is the venac (45:00 - 45:05)
question and she says which part of (45:01 - 45:10)
venin at's body gives off R (45:05 - 45:14)
sonar right she says the word (45:10 - 45:16)
sonar and you have like like you're (45:14 - 45:19)
you're I think it's radar not (45:16 - 45:21)
sonar but (45:19 - 45:25)
regardless sonar's underwater Oh yeah it (45:21 - 45:27)
might be radar (45:25 - 45:30)
uh yes yeah yeah I think it's radar (45:27 - 45:33)
anyways it's either antenna or (45:30 - 45:37)
eyes but both radar and sonar are not (45:33 - 45:39)
like (45:37 - 45:42)
visual Yep they're like that's the whole (45:39 - 45:46)
point they're like sound based so like (45:42 - 45:48)
eyes to me didn't seem I think everyone (45:46 - 45:52)
picked the antenna the answer was (45:48 - 45:55)
eyes yeah but like eyes to me pokedex (45:52 - 45:58)
entry but still it doesn't make sense (45:55 - 45:59)
yeah yeah I know I know it's like oh (45:58 - 46:02)
look at the Pokedex entry like let let's (45:59 - 46:06)
like the Pokedex entries are not like (46:02 - 46:08)
set in stone as being the most accurate (46:06 - 46:12)
isn't like rapid Dash like 700 degre (46:08 - 46:14)
farenheit and Ash just rides one in the (46:12 - 46:16)
anime you can just like touch rapid (46:14 - 46:18)
dases (46:16 - 46:22)
um but like like like that question (46:18 - 46:25)
sucks it's (46:22 - 46:30)
not yep it's just not a good (46:25 - 46:32)
question yeah everybody's got to get one (46:30 - 46:34)
wrong right like (46:32 - 46:37)
that's it's that if I was going to (46:34 - 46:39)
wonder about what they were looking at (46:37 - 46:41)
based off of their analytics based off (46:39 - 46:43)
of what everybody's doing and choosing (46:41 - 46:45)
and picking in these games I would be (46:43 - 46:47)
curious how many people actually got (46:45 - 46:48)
that one (46:47 - 46:51)
right yeah well I guess like we live in (46:48 - 46:53)
the world of the internet so if you were (46:51 - 46:55)
stumped on a quiz question you could (46:53 - 46:57)
have just Google it like there's nothing (46:55 - 46:59)
stopping you from pulling up venonat (46:57 - 47:03)
Pokédex entry on your iPhone as you're (46:59 - 47:05)
sitting there it's the (47:03 - 47:07)
principal yeah I mean I had no problem (47:05 - 47:09)
getting it wrong because I was like oh (47:07 - 47:10)
what happens when you get it wrong and (47:09 - 47:13)
it's like literally nothing yeah I (47:10 - 47:15)
wonder if you get it wrong a certain (47:13 - 47:18)
number of times does it fail like CU (47:15 - 47:20)
surely there's got to be a point where (47:18 - 47:22)
it gives up but I I didn't try anymore (47:20 - 47:24)
despite having gotten the venette (47:22 - 47:25)
question wrong there was still a point (47:24 - 47:27)
at which she said that I got all the (47:25 - 47:30)
questions right and that was (47:27 - 47:32)
disappointing honestly well I think this (47:30 - 47:34)
is why I don't like Lacy's trial because (47:32 - 47:37)
like amoris is you can actually fail (47:34 - 47:40)
yeah and CH crispens you can technically (47:37 - 47:42)
fail and you go back and you have to (47:40 - 47:44)
like figure it out it's like there's (47:42 - 47:46)
multiple ways to win that but there's (47:44 - 47:48)
still a fail state to that there's no (47:46 - 47:50)
fail state to Lacy's thing she's just (47:48 - 47:54)
like try again yeah yeah like I think (47:50 - 47:58)
lazyy I think with the quiz game stuff I (47:54 - 48:00)
think it would be so much (47:58 - 48:02)
cooler and I know this is a lot of work (48:00 - 48:04)
for Game Freak to literally just write (48:02 - 48:06)
like 10 more questions and then just (48:04 - 48:08)
have those questions randomized because (48:06 - 48:10)
I think in in a game like Pokemon which (48:08 - 48:12)
we're going to get to how Pokemon is a (48:10 - 48:14)
very social community- based game it (48:12 - 48:16)
always has been we're GNA get to that I (48:14 - 48:19)
promise you I think it's it would be so (48:16 - 48:22)
much more interesting to be like oh oh (48:19 - 48:25)
Al you didn't get the Grano question oh (48:22 - 48:27)
like Hannah didn't get the Cy like what (48:25 - 48:29)
question did you get oh you got a (48:27 - 48:31)
question about like turtonator oh dang (48:29 - 48:33)
that's like I didn't get that like I (48:31 - 48:35)
just think that's like dramatically more (48:33 - 48:37)
interesting to be like okay she's going (48:35 - 48:38)
to give you five questions but she's (48:37 - 48:40)
going to pull out of like 15 possible (48:38 - 48:43)
questions and if you get one (48:40 - 48:46)
wrong now there is a built-in fail state (48:43 - 48:47)
of like oh you need to get five (48:46 - 48:49)
questions right we're going to give you (48:47 - 48:51)
another question because we actually (48:49 - 48:53)
wrote more than five questions like (48:51 - 48:55)
that's how you fix that situation it's (48:53 - 48:57)
interesting CU like I'm comparing it to (48:55 - 49:01)
the the quiz that you get to defeat to (48:57 - 49:04)
to actually battle the Elite 4 in pal (49:01 - 49:06)
and that is an interesting one where (49:04 - 49:08)
it's like it's the same in the it's just (49:06 - 49:11)
like fixed questions but you can fail (49:08 - 49:14)
that one and there are a couple of not (49:11 - 49:16)
trick ones but it's not like they're (49:14 - 49:18)
kind of the answers obvious it's like (49:16 - 49:19)
you get to one near the end and it's (49:18 - 49:22)
like oh I'm just checking what did you (49:19 - 49:23)
say to this question I'm like I don't (49:22 - 49:27)
know what I said to that question (49:23 - 49:29)
I can't remember you know so it's like (49:27 - 49:31)
there is actually a little bit of (49:29 - 49:33)
challenge in that one yeah they have a (49:31 - 49:35)
question there of why are you here and (49:33 - 49:37)
one answer is to become champion and one (49:35 - 49:39)
answer is to have fun and if you say (49:37 - 49:42)
you're there to have fun they kick you (49:39 - 49:45)
out yeah just like real (49:42 - 49:48)
life all right there's one more Elite 4 (49:45 - 49:51)
member uh I think we did a good job of (49:48 - 49:52)
talking about the Elite 4 without (49:51 - 49:55)
actually talking about the Battle (49:52 - 49:56)
so (49:55 - 49:58)
so uh let's take a quick break we'll (49:56 - 49:59)
talk about the final Elite Four member (49:58 - 50:01)
we're not going to talk about Champion (49:59 - 50:02)
or Kieran so you don't have to worry (50:01 - 50:05)
about that like that there there spoiler (50:02 - 50:07)
there's no quiz for (50:05 - 50:09)
Kieran there's no like you got to make a (50:07 - 50:11)
sandwich to battle (50:09 - 50:14)
him there's no quiz there we'll talk (50:11 - 50:16)
about the uh the last Elite Four when we (50:14 - 50:18)
get back and then we're just going to (50:16 - 50:20)
talk about other like the leak club and (50:18 - 50:23)
the BP and the BBQs we're going to talk (50:20 - 50:24)
about all that when we get back so we (50:23 - 50:28)
will be right back and we are back from (50:24 - 50:32)
our break uh let's go talk about Drayton (50:28 - 50:35)
uh Dre Drayton that's how you say it man (50:32 - 50:37)
what what what a good character anyway (50:35 - 50:40)
we'll talk about that next week uh his (50:37 - 50:43)
trial is probably one of the most (50:40 - 50:45)
interesting thing one of the most (50:43 - 50:47)
interesting things in (50:45 - 50:52)
uh Pokemon trials which is uh you have (50:47 - 50:56)
to battle my three grunts but you must (50:52 - 51:00)
use only Pokemon caught in the the Dome (50:56 - 51:03)
the terod doome um so you can't catch (51:00 - 51:04)
them in raids you can't catch them in (51:03 - 51:06)
Pala you can't trade them over actually (51:04 - 51:08)
I don't I don't know if like Hannah (51:06 - 51:10)
caught a for a gra they have to be (51:08 - 51:13)
caught by you oh yeah yeah yeah he says (51:10 - 51:14)
there's two rules they have to be caught (51:13 - 51:16)
in the dome and they have to have your (51:14 - 51:19)
uh I think they say OT I think so (51:16 - 51:22)
yeah uh (51:19 - 51:26)
so you know when sword and shield were (51:22 - 51:28)
coming out or the DLC for sword and (51:26 - 51:30)
shield were coming out we all ask this (51:28 - 51:32)
question of like how are they going to (51:30 - 51:35)
do DLC because this game has existed for (51:32 - 51:37)
a year and if they want us to (51:35 - 51:40)
battle are they going to like take away (51:37 - 51:42)
our team like our team is probably like (51:40 - 51:43)
level 100 at this (51:42 - 51:46)
point like how are they going to how are (51:43 - 51:49)
they going to do that and this is such a (51:46 - 51:51)
simple solution to (51:49 - 51:54)
like like it's probably a solution not a (51:51 - 51:57)
lot of people love of like I want to go (51:54 - 52:00)
into kakami with my Meara because she's (51:57 - 52:02)
my favorite Pokemon and I've had her (52:00 - 52:03)
since day one and like I don't want to (52:02 - 52:05)
not use or I've been using like I get it (52:03 - 52:07)
right this is the whole problem with (52:05 - 52:10)
generation five is people were so mad (52:07 - 52:12)
that they had to use Unova Pokemon and (52:10 - 52:14)
they couldn't use their like Tyranitar (52:12 - 52:17)
from gener like like that was the that (52:14 - 52:19)
was the like dexit of Gen 5 is people (52:17 - 52:20)
were like I don't want to use new (52:19 - 52:24)
Pokemon I want to use salamance so (52:20 - 52:28)
like you know there's technically levels (52:24 - 52:31)
scaling in the DLC for sword and shield (52:28 - 52:34)
which was did you beat Leon no okay (52:31 - 52:36)
everyone's going to be like level 25 did (52:34 - 52:38)
you beat Leon yes okay everyone's going (52:36 - 52:41)
to be what it was like 72 or something (52:38 - 52:43)
in the crown Tundra n of armor something (52:41 - 52:46)
like that but then you're still faced (52:43 - 52:49)
with this well all my Pokemon are too (52:46 - 52:52)
high level so do I catch new ones I (52:49 - 52:55)
don't really want to like catch six more (52:52 - 52:57)
and like get them to like like there are (52:55 - 52:59)
options like you can do whatever I said (52:57 - 53:01)
it's whether or not you want to do that (52:59 - 53:03)
and this it was (53:01 - 53:05)
like you you have this is what you're (53:03 - 53:08)
doing like this is the trial like (53:05 - 53:11)
yep yes having said that like as with (53:08 - 53:13)
everything you can make it really easy (53:11 - 53:15)
if you want to right like you find four (53:13 - 53:17)
and then you pump them full of candy (53:15 - 53:20)
until they're level 100 and then none of (53:17 - 53:23)
them are difficult in that case right so (53:20 - 53:25)
like they still not easy though as some (53:23 - 53:29)
someone who did that I didn't train IVs (53:25 - 53:30)
or EVS on any of the Pokemon I caught (53:29 - 53:33)
but I did make all of them level 100 and (53:30 - 53:35)
they still weren't (53:33 - 53:39)
easy are you one hit koing his minions (53:35 - 53:42)
uh they were easier Drayton himself was (53:39 - 53:43)
not um you don't you don't have to use (53:42 - 53:45)
those Pokemon for you can use any (53:43 - 53:48)
Pokemon I know makes that clear but I (53:45 - 53:50)
still use that team just to see if I (53:48 - 53:52)
could that's a whole different thing (53:50 - 53:54)
then but that but that's that's the cool (53:52 - 53:56)
thing is like if if you're not paying (53:54 - 53:58)
attention to what drayton's saying he's (53:56 - 54:00)
saying that you need to build a you need (53:58 - 54:02)
to catch Pokemon in the dome with your (54:00 - 54:07)
OT for his minions for that the trial is (54:02 - 54:09)
the not (54:07 - 54:12)
him yeah so you have to build a team for (54:09 - 54:14)
his the three people that you battle and (54:12 - 54:16)
they I think they all have two Pokemon (54:14 - 54:18)
they all have a very clear strategy of (54:16 - 54:20)
you know just like crispens maybe this (54:18 - 54:22)
is why I like crispens and I like Dron (54:20 - 54:23)
the most because they're actually like (54:22 - 54:26)
battle focused before you battle four (54:23 - 54:30)
remember but um they're like 10 levels (54:26 - 54:33)
lower than Dron like I think they're (54:30 - 54:35)
like 72 or something like that and then (54:33 - 54:39)
Drayton is like 78 to 82 or whatever (54:35 - 54:42)
drayton's levels are (54:39 - 54:46)
um and I put so much thought into this I (54:42 - 54:50)
like I loved this so much like him being (54:46 - 54:52)
like your team uh-uh you got to use a (54:50 - 54:54)
new one and then so I'm like I'm like (54:52 - 54:56)
I'm like I like instantly I everything I (54:54 - 54:59)
was doing disappeared I was like now (54:56 - 55:01)
thinking about like what is the core of (54:59 - 55:04)
my team how what po what is my main (55:01 - 55:05)
attacker how am I going to support my (55:04 - 55:07)
main attacker what are my like what is (55:05 - 55:09)
my like sweeper that's going to be at (55:07 - 55:11)
the end with my main attacker I was so (55:09 - 55:14)
into this and my my twitch chat was like (55:11 - 55:17)
you only have to build it for the the (55:14 - 55:19)
the three people and I was like no I am (55:17 - 55:21)
building a brand new team and I am going (55:19 - 55:24)
to show Drayton that I am I'm bringing a (55:21 - 55:26)
brand new team and he is going to he's (55:24 - 55:29)
going to lose like yeah I think I think (55:26 - 55:30)
that's the thing is just as with (55:29 - 55:32)
everything in Pokemon it is as easy or (55:30 - 55:34)
as difficult as you make it right cuz (55:32 - 55:35)
like you were like oh yeah I'll do this (55:34 - 55:37)
and I was like I'm just going to assume (55:35 - 55:39)
that I can use my normal Pokemon against (55:37 - 55:41)
dayon I'm going to find like four (55:39 - 55:42)
Pokemon that have already caught that (55:41 - 55:44)
are different and I'm going to shove (55:42 - 55:46)
them fill of candy and I'm going to get (55:44 - 55:48)
rid of I didn't even know they only had (55:46 - 55:49)
two at that point I didn't realize it (55:48 - 55:51)
was going to be that yeah I didn't (55:49 - 55:52)
realize they were going to only have two (55:51 - 55:54)
I didn't realize they were going to be (55:52 - 55:58)
different types I assumed we would have (55:54 - 56:00)
to keep using that team for that whole (55:58 - 56:03)
past the trial yeah and so I went in (56:00 - 56:04)
there as someone who's not good at (56:03 - 56:06)
competitive hasn't really done it very (56:04 - 56:08)
much isn't great at team building and I (56:06 - 56:10)
did the very best I could and I still (56:08 - 56:14)
had some issues so there there can be a (56:10 - 56:16)
challenge there well it's crazy too (56:14 - 56:19)
because like like Al said and like you (56:16 - 56:21)
know what anyone on this podcast has (56:19 - 56:23)
been saying for years is Pokemon is as (56:21 - 56:26)
easy or as hard as you you may (56:23 - 56:27)
like if you just wanted to build (56:26 - 56:28)
something (56:27 - 56:30)
foron knowing that he's a dragon type (56:28 - 56:33)
gym leader you're in the ice biome so (56:30 - 56:36)
you you could build a whole ice team (56:33 - 56:37)
like that's the thing about like all (56:36 - 56:40)
that was the point yeah started building (56:37 - 56:41)
my team I thought that he was placed (56:40 - 56:44)
there specifically for that (56:41 - 56:46)
reason there were some people that were (56:44 - 56:48)
like oh I I thought I could only catch (56:46 - 56:50)
them in this specific biome I didn't (56:48 - 56:53)
think I could have the whole dome which (56:50 - 56:55)
is also like very interesting to be like (56:53 - 56:57)
oh but like even if you were for some (56:55 - 57:00)
reason struggling with Crispen you could (56:57 - 57:03)
just go out and get more water Pokemon (57:00 - 57:06)
right like he's fire he's weak to water (57:03 - 57:11)
um when I was battling Lacy so I saw or (57:06 - 57:13)
like heard that (57:11 - 57:16)
like drayton's Elite 4 is going to make (57:13 - 57:18)
you catch new Pokemon and I was like I (57:16 - 57:20)
don't know if that's true or (57:18 - 57:23)
not but like do I want to do Drayton (57:20 - 57:27)
first to (57:23 - 57:30)
like force myself to build a new team (57:27 - 57:32)
and then do the other three or do I just (57:30 - 57:38)
want to use my team that I've had like I (57:32 - 57:42)
it's it's so tough to make that decision (57:38 - 57:44)
of like I'm in this new area and I want (57:42 - 57:46)
to see this new content but do I want to (57:44 - 57:49)
stop what I'm doing to get a new team (57:46 - 57:51)
because there are new Pokemon here and (57:49 - 57:53)
then do I want to like level them up and (57:51 - 57:56)
E like when I prep for Drayton (57:53 - 58:01)
that was probably like two hours of like (57:56 - 58:04)
I spent at least an hour on that and the (58:01 - 58:06)
what and I made that I made that own (58:04 - 58:08)
work like I could have just caught a (58:06 - 58:11)
couple Pokemon pumped them full of candy (58:08 - 58:13)
pumped them full of vitamins and battled (58:11 - 58:14)
but I wanted to go I was like I want (58:13 - 58:17)
them all to be in the same Pokeball so (58:14 - 58:18)
and then because I'm catching I have to (58:17 - 58:20)
catch them myself so they I can put them (58:18 - 58:21)
on the same Pokéball and then I was like (58:20 - 58:24)
because of the new Mark feature with the (58:21 - 58:26)
camera which we'll get too I was like I (58:24 - 58:28)
want them all to at least have a mark (58:26 - 58:30)
and they've all going to be shiny and no (58:28 - 58:32)
I they could you could yeah they're all (58:30 - 58:33)
going to be (58:32 - 58:36)
shiny so that's what I did and it took (58:33 - 58:38)
and like like walking like it was (58:36 - 58:40)
literally for two hours I was like okay (58:38 - 58:42)
I for sure want this Pokemon I for sure (58:40 - 58:44)
want this Pokemon I want this Pokemon (58:42 - 58:45)
and then it was like as I'm catching (58:44 - 58:47)
them I'm like looking and I'm like oh (58:45 - 58:50)
maybe I want this instead or like oh I I (58:47 - 58:52)
want a fake out user for sure and then (58:50 - 58:55)
it was like well I know Kieran is after (58:52 - 58:57)
this this so instead of just building (58:55 - 58:59)
something that's super effective against (58:57 - 59:02)
trayon I'm going to build a rounded team (58:59 - 59:04)
because I want to take this team against (59:02 - 59:05)
Kieran as (59:04 - 59:08)
well so that's what I did so I actually (59:05 - 59:10)
like built a like a really rounded team (59:08 - 59:13)
that was like that could handle whatever (59:10 - 59:15)
Kieran had but also that you know could (59:13 - 59:16)
work against dragons so this whole (59:15 - 59:18)
process took me like two hours and I'm (59:16 - 59:22)
sitting there like like giving them (59:18 - 59:23)
ability capsules to change their (59:22 - 59:25)
abilities I'm like giving them like (59:23 - 59:27)
proper EV spreads with vitamins and I'm (59:25 - 59:30)
like this is so easy for me because I (59:27 - 59:33)
literally have 800 of every vitamin and (59:30 - 59:37)
I have like Max XL candy but like I (59:33 - 59:39)
don't think an average person is sitting (59:37 - 59:41)
there doing that I feel like an average (59:39 - 59:44)
person is just pumping them up to level (59:41 - 59:45)
100 and then brute forcing your way (59:44 - 59:47)
through which there's nothing wrong with (59:45 - 59:49)
that yeah Hannah's pointing to herself (59:47 - 59:53)
but like I I was like okay like I'm (59:49 - 59:55)
going to only Power them up to 80 I'm (59:53 - 59:57)
going to give them their vitamins I'm (59:55 - 60:00)
going to give them their mints and then (59:57 - 60:02)
I'm not going to power them up and we're (60:00 - 60:03)
going to be like I'm going to be on a (60:02 - 60:07)
fair term battle with with uh Drayton (60:03 - 60:08)
because all the all all the elite four (60:07 - 60:10)
members they're eeve trained they all (60:08 - 60:13)
have held items right like this Elite 4 (60:10 - 60:15)
is For Better or For Worse the most (60:13 - 60:17)
challenging Elite 4 there and I know (60:15 - 60:19)
people are like well it was really easy (60:17 - 60:22)
for me yeah I know it was easy for you (60:19 - 60:24)
Brendan you were using a Kyogre and a (60:22 - 60:26)
Tornadus and you you Tailwind water (60:24 - 60:27)
spout and you're all level 100 yeah of (60:26 - 60:29)
course it was easy you had six legendary (60:27 - 60:31)
Pokemon one of them being ogre Pon at (60:29 - 60:34)
level 100 cool you steam through it no (60:31 - 60:37)
one's saying you can't do that but like (60:34 - 60:40)
it was really easy yeah I we get it (60:37 - 60:41)
you're 20 levels (60:40 - 60:44)
above I do love how the three of us did (60:41 - 60:46)
like the full spectrum of things right (60:44 - 60:48)
Steve's there catching his team that's (60:46 - 60:50)
going to be the team for the entire DLC (60:48 - 60:53)
and he's EV training them and he's (60:50 - 60:55)
making sure marks and Hannah is like I'm (60:53 - 60:56)
going to make sure that I at least do (60:55 - 60:58)
Dayton as well right so I'm going to get (60:56 - 60:59)
a decent team and blah blah blah blah (60:58 - 61:02)
and I'm just like what have I got I've (60:59 - 61:04)
got these four (61:02 - 61:07)
Pokemon liter like literally I went into (61:04 - 61:09)
my box and I went I have four Pokemon (61:07 - 61:10)
let me put them in there put them up to (61:09 - 61:12)
level 100 and I killed the three of them (61:10 - 61:15)
and I went right back to my usual (61:12 - 61:17)
team I might have done something like (61:15 - 61:18)
that except that I hadn't been catching (61:17 - 61:20)
any Pokémon I was trying to do story (61:18 - 61:23)
story story story story and I'd caught (61:20 - 61:25)
maybe one Pokémon so far cuz it was (61:23 - 61:28)
shiny and so I needed to go find others (61:25 - 61:30)
I didn't have a huge number of them but (61:28 - 61:33)
I did have enough I was so dedicated to (61:30 - 61:36)
building my team that I was like walking (61:33 - 61:39)
past starter Pokemon and I was like I'll (61:36 - 61:41)
catch him later not knowing that like (61:39 - 61:43)
starter Pokemon are like weirdly spawned (61:41 - 61:45)
in this game so like going back to that (61:43 - 61:48)
area being like I I can't find Torchic (61:45 - 61:51)
anymore like anyways but like I was so (61:48 - 61:53)
into that and I think the takeaway here (61:51 - 61:55)
isn't whether like it was easy or hard (61:53 - 61:59)
but it's just like Pokemon can do this (61:55 - 62:03)
thing where it can be like we're asking (61:59 - 62:07)
you of something and the three of us had (62:03 - 62:10)
such drastic and different answers to (62:07 - 62:12)
that solution and I think that's why I (62:10 - 62:14)
was like so bummed about Lacy's trial (62:12 - 62:16)
because it wasn't that experience it was (62:14 - 62:20)
just like everyone knew exactly uh like (62:16 - 62:22)
yeah if you want any of these to be (62:20 - 62:26)
harder bring level 60 Pokemon instead of (62:22 - 62:28)
level 75 like (62:26 - 62:31)
there's like I challenge myself always (62:28 - 62:33)
with the like when I was battling Lacy I (62:31 - 62:36)
was using a level 100 golden go and uh (62:33 - 62:37)
like a Clefairy and I was like I know (62:36 - 62:39)
somebody in my chat's going to say (62:37 - 62:40)
something and somebody did they're like (62:39 - 62:41)
well Steve it's easy because you're (62:40 - 62:44)
using a level 100 golden go I like (62:41 - 62:46)
you're yes thank you for pointing out (62:44 - 62:47)
the obvious water is also wet but like (62:46 - 62:49)
it doesn't matter if my golden goes (62:47 - 62:52)
level 100 or level 80 here I'm still (62:49 - 62:54)
going to hit make it rain like I'm still (62:52 - 62:56)
going to n n y plot Make It Rain and (62:54 - 62:57)
she's still going to like make it rain (62:56 - 63:01)
is such a busted move like is like (62:57 - 63:02)
that's like saying like searching (63:01 - 63:05)
strikes is like a balance like searching (63:02 - 63:07)
strikes is so incredibly busted like (63:05 - 63:11)
three hit from U always critting Steve (63:07 - 63:12)
you're just constantly cheating in these (63:11 - 63:14)
games you know you brought normal fight (63:12 - 63:17)
totina fight you know come on I remember (63:14 - 63:19)
bringing a normal Pokemon to a gutina (63:17 - 63:21)
and I was definitely cheating how dare (63:19 - 63:23)
you use tight (63:21 - 63:26)
matchups how dare I understand super (63:23 - 63:28)
Effectiveness so yeah they teach you at (63:26 - 63:31)
the start of every single game so yeah (63:28 - 63:33)
when I was battling Drayton I was like (63:31 - 63:36)
okay no revives no held well no potions (63:33 - 63:39)
no anything like I want to be oneon-one (63:36 - 63:42)
with Ron and I had such a good time and (63:39 - 63:44)
I always think about the people that are (63:42 - 63:46)
like well it was so easy I just used (63:44 - 63:48)
level 100 Pokemon and it was like no one (63:46 - 63:50)
is forcing you to do that if that's what (63:48 - 63:53)
you want to do totally cool I to like (63:50 - 63:55)
when I was going into this DLC I was (63:53 - 63:56)
like do I really want to build a new (63:55 - 63:58)
team do I like even for amoris I was (63:56 - 64:00)
like I know exactly what amoris is going (63:58 - 64:03)
to do I already fought her in New York (64:00 - 64:04)
so (64:03 - 64:08)
like I like I can't unlearn what amoris (64:04 - 64:11)
does and that was like that was kind of (64:08 - 64:13)
the struggle I played with is like well (64:11 - 64:16)
I could build a new team to level 80 to (64:13 - 64:18)
battle all these but at least with (64:16 - 64:21)
amorus I I know what she I know her Ace (64:18 - 64:22)
I know what she's going to open with I (64:21 - 64:24)
know she's going to try to Ste set (64:22 - 64:25)
Stealth Rock (64:24 - 64:27)
um I know she's going to try to trick (64:25 - 64:34)
room like I the I don't think like as a (64:27 - 64:35)
I have so many thoughts about this I'm (64:34 - 64:37)
sorry as like a TW like like an (64:35 - 64:39)
eight-year-old (64:37 - 64:42)
right if I was losing in a video game if (64:39 - 64:45)
I I was like losing in like a racing (64:42 - 64:46)
game or at like Street Fighter or (64:45 - 64:47)
whatever I was playing as like an (64:46 - 64:49)
eight-year-old I would have been the kid (64:47 - 64:52)
to be like oh I accidentally unplugged (64:49 - 64:56)
the Sega Genesis or like oh I my finger (64:52 - 64:58)
slipped on the reset button and like I (64:56 - 65:01)
didn't actually lose as an 8-year-old (64:58 - 65:03)
because like oh there was no conclusion (65:01 - 65:06)
to this this match right and I feel like (65:03 - 65:08)
there are modern adult Pokemon players (65:06 - 65:13)
that can't fathom losing a Pokemon (65:08 - 65:15)
battle right they're like they they're (65:13 - 65:17)
like I'm going to bring all level 100s (65:15 - 65:18)
and then I'm going to complain it's to (65:17 - 65:22)
easy but there like like yeah there's (65:18 - 65:25)
nothing wrong with losing a like like no (65:22 - 65:27)
one's going to like shame you into be (65:25 - 65:29)
like oh like oh I lost to amoris okay (65:27 - 65:30)
the second time I beat her cool like you (65:29 - 65:33)
lost to her cuz like you didn't like oh (65:30 - 65:35)
she know she had know self Dr I know how (65:33 - 65:36)
to counter that now like it's not that (65:35 - 65:38)
big of a deal I think that's the thing (65:36 - 65:42)
right like I it's a lot about as we've (65:38 - 65:45)
disc what what you get out of it but (65:42 - 65:47)
also what you enjoy right like I have (65:45 - 65:50)
never really enjoyed battling um and (65:47 - 65:53)
like the raids the Seven Star raids have (65:50 - 65:54)
been a little bit more interesting for (65:53 - 65:56)
me but like battling in general has (65:54 - 65:58)
never been something that I've actually (65:56 - 65:59)
enjoyed I've always been a collector (65:58 - 66:01)
right the point the reason I love (65:59 - 66:03)
Pokemon the things I do is collecting (66:01 - 66:06)
which gets more and more dangerous as (66:03 - 66:09)
you get older and you get more less time (66:06 - 66:13)
um but more Pokemon games um and so I I (66:09 - 66:15)
did as much as possible to get through (66:13 - 66:18)
that the Elite 4 and have the battles (66:15 - 66:21)
done as quickly as possible so then I (66:18 - 66:22)
could focus on the things that I (66:21 - 66:25)
actually cared about but you don't see (66:22 - 66:27)
me complaining about it that's the point (66:25 - 66:29)
I you know I'm not going to go oh it's (66:27 - 66:31)
too easy because I don't it doesn't (66:29 - 66:33)
really I don't care it doesn't matter (66:31 - 66:36)
right like I did it it's done now now I (66:33 - 66:38)
can focus on the things I actually enjoy (66:36 - 66:40)
and games are like that in general you (66:38 - 66:42)
can do or not do what you want nobody's (66:40 - 66:44)
forcing you to play these games yeah you (66:42 - 66:46)
can definitely do things to make it (66:44 - 66:49)
easier yeah or do things to make it (66:46 - 66:51)
harder like yeah to the people that are (66:49 - 66:55)
like man I wish I I I wish that like (66:51 - 66:57)
the gym leaders were harder it was like (66:55 - 66:59)
well some gym leaders have like three (66:57 - 67:02)
Pokemon and you have six you don't have (66:59 - 67:06)
to have six like you don't have to spam (67:02 - 67:10)
Max potion in the battle you like you're (67:06 - 67:11)
you're making that choice like I wish (67:10 - 67:14)
like gyms would like restrict (67:11 - 67:18)
items okay just don't use just don't use (67:14 - 67:20)
items then you don't have to have the (67:18 - 67:23)
game tell you to do that right like like (67:20 - 67:25)
that's why drayton's trials so cool he (67:23 - 67:29)
tells you the rules and you can do so (67:25 - 67:31)
many different things with those like (67:29 - 67:33)
they're there are there are there are (67:31 - 67:36)
two hard rules like you can't like brute (67:33 - 67:38)
force it right like you can't I can't (67:36 - 67:40)
trade with Hannah and be like I'm get (67:38 - 67:42)
EAS like there they the game is smart (67:40 - 67:44)
enough to know like has to be OT has to (67:42 - 67:48)
be caught here but like you have so much (67:44 - 67:51)
freedom I I think that's why I think (67:48 - 67:52)
that's why I preferred this to the (67:51 - 67:54)
cooking one cuz it was like the cooking (67:52 - 67:56)
one was like how I feel most puzzle (67:54 - 67:59)
games are it's not really a puzzle it's (67:56 - 68:01)
just like you do the things and and then (67:59 - 68:03)
you it's done right there's a (68:01 - 68:06)
solution it's no it's not really though (68:03 - 68:08)
right like it's not (68:06 - 68:11)
that it's if you do all of the things (68:08 - 68:13)
you win right like that's not really a (68:11 - 68:15)
puzzle that's just doing the things you (68:13 - 68:16)
do all the things and Stu get the wrong (68:15 - 68:19)
ingredients it's it's like saying it's (68:16 - 68:21)
like saying that like collect finishing (68:19 - 68:22)
the Pokédex is a puzzle it's not really (68:21 - 68:24)
it's just collecting the things it's not (68:22 - 68:27)
a puzzle but anyway that aside from the (68:24 - 68:28)
point I know I get what point you're (68:27 - 68:30)
making with Dayton there are so many (68:28 - 68:33)
different ways you're not you're not (68:30 - 68:35)
restricted by the Pokemon you can do (68:33 - 68:38)
other than it's the 200 that are in this (68:35 - 68:39)
this building right and that gives you (68:38 - 68:41)
so many different possibilities I mean I (68:39 - 68:42)
still didn't care right I still didn't (68:41 - 68:44)
do I still didn't do anything about that (68:42 - 68:46)
I just use whatever I had but I find (68:44 - 68:50)
that more interesting on an intellectual (68:46 - 68:54)
level yeah so the other thing that like (68:50 - 68:56)
the other thing that's like I think (68:54 - 68:57)
separating from like double battles (68:56 - 68:59)
right because again you have you always (68:57 - 69:00)
have like Pokemon fans being like too (68:59 - 69:04)
easy too hard like the I soloed this (69:00 - 69:05)
with an anip right like there's this (69:04 - 69:07)
weird like I need to brag that I feel (69:05 - 69:11)
like exists in Pokemon that doesn't get (69:07 - 69:12)
come from other games I don't know like (69:11 - 69:15)
when I when I played like Destiny or (69:12 - 69:18)
Elden ring or something right in a game (69:15 - 69:20)
where you would fail over and over like (69:18 - 69:22)
in a destiny raid we would like lose to (69:20 - 69:24)
like croa like 60 some time in a row and (69:22 - 69:26)
then it was like okay finally the whole (69:24 - 69:28)
team clicked all right we defeated Cota (69:26 - 69:30)
right or in like Elden ring when you're (69:28 - 69:31)
sitting in front of a boss and you're (69:30 - 69:34)
like I lost to this boss like 13 times (69:31 - 69:35)
but then I finally did it and it felt so (69:34 - 69:37)
good it just feels like there are some (69:35 - 69:40)
Pokemon fans that are like they cannot (69:37 - 69:43)
grasps the concept of like losing a (69:40 - 69:45)
single Pokemon battle which isn't like (69:43 - 69:46)
that big of a (69:45 - 69:49)
deal it's okay if you don't necessarily (69:46 - 69:50)
want to lose them but don't complain (69:49 - 69:52)
when you're making it easier for (69:50 - 69:54)
yourself yeah like in Elden ring also (69:52 - 69:56)
you could like super overlevel and get (69:54 - 69:58)
like really great armor and be like okay (69:56 - 70:00)
now this specific fight was way easier (69:58 - 70:01)
because I I (70:00 - 70:05)
did work to do that right like um like (70:01 - 70:07)
you could make a destiny raid harder I (70:05 - 70:11)
guess by not bringing a rocket launcher (70:07 - 70:15)
to Athen or something uh anyways but (70:11 - 70:17)
like the other thing about double (70:15 - 70:20)
battles is like specifically with (70:17 - 70:25)
Drayton I intimidated (70:20 - 70:28)
his Dragonite like three times in a row (70:25 - 70:31)
and then I left it there I avoided it at (70:28 - 70:33)
that point because I understand the (70:31 - 70:36)
mechanics of a double battle and I (70:33 - 70:38)
knowing how that worked turned that into (70:36 - 70:42)
a 2v one so by pretty (70:38 - 70:44)
much paralyzing his Dragonite but (70:42 - 70:47)
without the move paralyzed just making (70:44 - 70:50)
his Dragonite useless I could then just (70:47 - 70:52)
focus on the new Pokemon that was coming (70:50 - 70:55)
out and that in inherently made the (70:52 - 70:57)
battle easier for me because I made his (70:55 - 70:58)
Dragonite dead weight now obviously if (70:57 - 71:01)
you're playing against a human player or (70:58 - 71:03)
maybe a computer with slightly better AI (71:01 - 71:05)
they would be like I need to switch my (71:03 - 71:07)
Dragonite out because it has intimidate (71:05 - 71:09)
but that also puts me in the advantage (71:07 - 71:11)
because instead of trying (71:09 - 71:14)
to uh attack he has to now waste the (71:11 - 71:17)
turn by switching out right like this is (71:14 - 71:20)
why I guess we can transition (71:17 - 71:23)
into this game has no battle tower this (71:20 - 71:25)
game has no B Battle Frontier this game (71:23 - 71:27)
has no battle Subway for a battle (71:25 - 71:30)
focused DLC which now that the DLC is (71:27 - 71:32)
out it kind of feels like it's not (71:30 - 71:35)
battle (71:32 - 71:38)
focused it's more battle focused is more (71:35 - 71:41)
battle focused um there is (71:38 - 71:44)
no battle tower there is no Battle (71:41 - 71:45)
Frontier there's no battle Subway (71:44 - 71:47)
there's no battle tree there is none of (71:45 - 71:49)
that um there are a lot of double (71:47 - 71:52)
battles around the map there is the (71:49 - 71:55)
Elite 4 which is again again whether or (71:52 - 71:57)
not you had an easy or hard time with it (71:55 - 72:00)
is on paper the hardest Elite Four that (71:57 - 72:02)
they've ever made (72:00 - 72:05)
um every single Elite 4 member was eveve (72:02 - 72:09)
trained every single Pokemon had a held (72:05 - 72:11)
item the levels are technically higher (72:09 - 72:12)
than (72:11 - 72:17)
Cynthia um Kieran is the highest level (72:12 - 72:19)
trainer in the entire (72:17 - 72:22)
series statistically his Pokemon are (72:19 - 72:24)
just higher level than that before that (72:22 - 72:26)
was Cynthia and Brilliant Diamond (72:24 - 72:29)
shining Pearl (72:26 - 72:29)
um there I (72:29 - 72:35)
I I don't want to come on the show and (72:32 - 72:36)
say (72:35 - 72:38)
like it's not a big deal that they don't (72:36 - 72:41)
have a battle tower I don't want because (72:38 - 72:43)
I because I think the battle tower adds (72:41 - 72:47)
value to some people 100% it's more (72:43 - 72:49)
content I'm never going to be (72:47 - 72:53)
like please game freak cut my content I (72:49 - 72:55)
would like less of (72:53 - 72:59)
it but I I don't understand why there (72:55 - 73:02)
isn't something but I guess I understand (72:59 - 73:05)
it from I I can understand it from two (73:02 - 73:06)
reasons and I'm not saying these are (73:05 - 73:07)
maybe the reasons you want to hear but (73:06 - 73:10)
here are the two reasons number one is (73:07 - 73:11)
they've they've literally said this (73:10 - 73:13)
before I'm pretty sure it was like the (73:11 - 73:16)
Battle Frontier or whatever in Gen 4 (73:13 - 73:19)
they were like no one did it so we (73:16 - 73:21)
stopped putting effort into it they (73:19 - 73:22)
they've said this in interviews where (73:21 - 73:25)
they're like or maybe it was gen 3 I (73:22 - 73:27)
don't remember but they were like no one (73:25 - 73:29)
did it so we stopped doing it there's (73:27 - 73:33)
your answer like (73:29 - 73:33)
which I I believe right like you can go (73:33 - 73:38)
on to your Playstation you can go to the (73:36 - 73:42)
little trophy section and like see how (73:38 - 73:44)
many people even do like the first (73:42 - 73:47)
mission of like blue Adventure or (73:44 - 73:51)
whatever on PS5 it'll be like 60% you're (73:47 - 73:53)
like how many people bought this game (73:51 - 73:56)
and only 60% of them got through the (73:53 - 73:59)
first mission like it's crazy like look (73:56 - 74:01)
at PlayStation trophies of like any game (73:59 - 74:04)
and see like oh no one is completing (74:01 - 74:06)
these games whether they're too hard too (74:04 - 74:09)
easy uh they got bored they're bad games (74:06 - 74:11)
they're glitchy who knows but like the (74:09 - 74:14)
coolest thing in Destiny was the The (74:11 - 74:17)
Raid and if you go at the time I don't (74:14 - 74:18)
know it's been like seven years since (74:17 - 74:21)
Destiny came out it said like 5% of (74:18 - 74:25)
people did this that's crazy crazy to (74:21 - 74:29)
like put so much effort into making a (74:25 - 74:32)
raid and then to see that only five% of (74:29 - 74:34)
all your players even experience that (74:32 - 74:38)
content so like I don't know how many (74:34 - 74:40)
people had di Battle Frontier Battle (74:38 - 74:43)
tree battle tower but I would suspect (74:40 - 74:47)
that has something to do with it um the (74:43 - 74:49)
other thing (74:47 - 74:51)
which could be related could not be (74:49 - 74:53)
related is they want you to do (74:51 - 74:55)
competitive they want you to do ranked (74:53 - 74:57)
the and the reason I say that isn't (74:55 - 74:58)
because like they've always pushed (74:57 - 75:01)
ranked because kind of have since like (74:58 - 75:06)
sun and moon but they really pump up the (75:01 - 75:08)
rewards and rank like you can get level (75:06 - 75:12)
balls you can get uh like five urb mysas (75:08 - 75:15)
like literally every season just by (75:12 - 75:16)
hitting like master rank like the (75:15 - 75:19)
rewards in rank are legitimately good (75:16 - 75:21)
and if you like battling you would be (75:19 - 75:23)
doing it and then you would be also (75:21 - 75:27)
rewarded with the stuff they give yeah (75:23 - 75:29)
uh so I don't know if it was like well (75:27 - 75:31)
we we want to put more effort into this (75:29 - 75:33)
instead of that and so the thing is (75:31 - 75:34)
getting the thing getting cut is the (75:33 - 75:37)
battle tower I guess again I don't I'm (75:34 - 75:39)
not saying that it shouldn't be there (75:37 - 75:41)
it's but those are possible reasons it's (75:39 - 75:42)
going to be the same as everything (75:41 - 75:45)
that's not in the games right like it's (75:42 - 75:47)
we can't know for certain the reasons (75:45 - 75:48)
there was a decision made or there (75:47 - 75:50)
wasn't a decision made because they just (75:48 - 75:52)
never thought about it or they never (75:50 - 75:54)
actually went like somebody went oh we (75:52 - 75:55)
were doing a battle tower and then (75:54 - 75:57)
nobody replied to that so it just didn't (75:55 - 75:59)
happen right like you know we just we'll (75:57 - 76:01)
we'll never truly know and there are (75:59 - 76:02)
some decisions that you look at and you (76:01 - 76:05)
go that is wild I cannot understand why (76:02 - 76:07)
they made that decision and then there (76:05 - 76:08)
are other ones where you're like yeah (76:07 - 76:11)
okay fine I get it and you know the the (76:08 - 76:14)
the amount of even even if it seems like (76:11 - 76:16)
it's not a huge amount of work for (76:14 - 76:20)
something and it also then affects other (76:16 - 76:22)
things like if you take for (76:20 - 76:25)
example what Pokémon you can catch right (76:22 - 76:27)
like they might have there are there are (76:25 - 76:30)
other reasons why you might only be able (76:27 - 76:31)
to catch certain Pokemon in certain (76:30 - 76:33)
games and that's because you know what (76:31 - 76:35)
funnily enough it incentivizes people to (76:33 - 76:37)
buy multiple games right there are there (76:35 - 76:39)
are competing things with these things (76:37 - 76:41)
like for example whether you can get (76:39 - 76:44)
specific shinies as leg legendaries as (76:41 - 76:46)
shinies in specific games might force (76:44 - 76:48)
people to do a different thing like (76:46 - 76:49)
Raiden Pokemon go for example it's just (76:48 - 76:52)
it's such a complicated thing which such (76:49 - 76:55)
a huge not even just company right it's (76:52 - 76:56)
multiple companies that's the other (76:55 - 76:58)
thing about Pokemon it's three companies (76:56 - 77:00)
own Pokemon right there's so many (76:58 - 77:03)
competing interests that it it's I mean (77:00 - 77:05)
it must be Dreadful to actually be part (77:03 - 77:09)
of those decision making process anyway (77:05 - 77:09)
but but I like I think of like I think (77:10 - 77:15)
of the battle tower in sword and shield (77:13 - 77:17)
right and I'm curious of how many people (77:15 - 77:19)
did it because it was the easier battle (77:17 - 77:22)
tower like when I and this is coming (77:19 - 77:24)
from somebody who like I do competitive (77:22 - 77:27)
right like I've qualified for (77:24 - 77:28)
tournaments I've done I've gone to (77:27 - 77:30)
tournaments I've made it to master rank (77:28 - 77:32)
every season in sword and shield I have (77:30 - 77:34)
I have literally not made it to master (77:32 - 77:38)
rank in scarland Violet because not well (77:34 - 77:40)
I did like Dynamax a little bit better (77:38 - 77:42)
than terara but I've just been so busy (77:40 - 77:43)
with other stuff (77:42 - 77:45)
like there's a million things I want to (77:43 - 77:47)
do in scarlet and violet that I just (77:45 - 77:50)
haven't gotten to uh (77:47 - 77:52)
but (77:50 - 77:56)
in in Sun and (77:52 - 77:56)
Moon I got into battling near the end of (77:56 - 78:01)
that and I had it like I built an (77:59 - 78:03)
incinerar and everything in that game I (78:01 - 78:05)
shiny hunted it built it and then I ran (78:03 - 78:07)
through the battle tree and I got the (78:05 - 78:10)
first ribbon you get from the battle (78:07 - 78:13)
tree and then I wanted to go through the (78:10 - 78:15)
the Second Battle tree the harder battle (78:13 - 78:16)
tree which I think is like the first one (78:15 - 78:18)
is like 25 battles and then the next one (78:16 - 78:20)
is like 50 battles without (78:18 - 78:24)
losing and I just I was like I I'm I'm (78:20 - 78:26)
done here like I got to like 48 and I (78:24 - 78:28)
lost which is like no big deal because (78:26 - 78:29)
it was like literally I lost because of (78:28 - 78:31)
RNG I like got like paralyzed three (78:29 - 78:33)
times in a row and it was like it (78:31 - 78:36)
literally I just needed one 30% to not (78:33 - 78:38)
activate and I would have won this (78:36 - 78:39)
battle which sucks but it was like at (78:38 - 78:40)
that (78:39 - 78:43)
point I was like I just don't want to do (78:40 - 78:45)
this again like I I like I I literally (78:43 - 78:48)
lost because of paralysis and which is (78:45 - 78:51)
like that happens like that that happens (78:48 - 78:54)
in just poke you're playing a very RNG (78:51 - 78:56)
based (78:54 - 78:59)
game um and then you go to you go to (78:56 - 79:00)
certain shield and like that battle (78:59 - 79:03)
tower is like much easier um but then I (79:00 - 79:05)
like I think about like black black and (79:03 - 79:09)
white like in in the in the Union uh the (79:05 - 79:11)
club room sorry in the club room one of (79:09 - 79:13)
the one of the thing one of the themes (79:11 - 79:15)
is I think it's like dark I think it's (79:13 - 79:17)
like monochromatic and when you switch (79:15 - 79:19)
that that theme you actually see there's (79:17 - 79:21)
like a portrait of like Black Tower and (79:19 - 79:23)
white forest on the wall it's really (79:21 - 79:24)
cool like there's a lot of black and (79:23 - 79:25)
white references we've already talked (79:24 - 79:26)
about that and I was like oh yeah I (79:25 - 79:28)
remember Black Tower I remember going (79:26 - 79:29)
through it at the very end you fight (79:28 - 79:31)
alder's nephew or whatever I can't (79:29 - 79:33)
remember his name banga I was like you (79:31 - 79:34)
fight banga he's like the champion of (79:33 - 79:36)
that and at the very end of Black Tower (79:34 - 79:37)
after you do all those battles you get (79:36 - 79:40)
like a freeze shiny Dratini right like (79:37 - 79:42)
both for the for the audio people both (79:40 - 79:44)
Hannah and Al are trying to think about (79:42 - 79:45)
what I'm talking about but this is the (79:44 - 79:47)
point I'm trying to make a lot of people (79:45 - 79:50)
just don't do that stuff like they give (79:47 - 79:52)
you a free shiny after doing 50 battles (79:50 - 79:54)
in Black Tower maybe it's not 50 maybe (79:52 - 79:55)
it's like 35 and then you get a free (79:54 - 79:58)
shiny Dratini which is cool and I did (79:55 - 79:59)
that and I had a good time with that but (79:58 - 80:01)
after I did that I thought to myself I (79:59 - 80:04)
never want to do this again (80:01 - 80:07)
because I I already know what it is uh (80:04 - 80:09)
my last example here is in in the aisle (80:07 - 80:12)
of armor so there is a battle tower in (80:09 - 80:15)
Galler right you fight Leon Leon gets (80:12 - 80:17)
sentenced to the battle tower and like (80:15 - 80:19)
you after you do like 15 battles Leon (80:17 - 80:21)
shows up you fight Leon you get a ribbon (80:19 - 80:24)
and it repeats now those those the the (80:21 - 80:26)
battles in the battle tower can be (80:24 - 80:28)
single or double and like they can be (80:26 - 80:30)
randomized a little bit like there are (80:28 - 80:31)
more trainers than what you actually (80:30 - 80:35)
fight but um in the aisle of Armor after (80:31 - 80:37)
you finish the story you can actually go (80:35 - 80:40)
into the dojo and there is uh like a (80:37 - 80:43)
quote unquote like Tower battle (80:40 - 80:44)
challenge there a gauntlet I think they (80:43 - 80:46)
call it and so you have to do three (80:44 - 80:49)
battles in a row with a specific type (80:46 - 80:52)
and there's 18 challenges so it's 18 (80:49 - 80:56)
times three and if you lose one of those (80:52 - 80:59)
three you get kicked back out and every (80:56 - 81:02)
time you go in so so really like the (80:59 - 81:04)
first three are like fire water grass so (81:02 - 81:06)
you have to bring three fire Pokemon so (81:04 - 81:07)
you bring three fire (81:06 - 81:10)
Pokemon and you have to fight three (81:07 - 81:13)
Pokemon and the the three that you're (81:10 - 81:14)
fighting are always randomized and you (81:13 - 81:15)
have to win three battles in a row and (81:14 - 81:19)
they potentially get harder and (81:15 - 81:21)
sometimes just because of RNG you're (81:19 - 81:22)
like I'm on my third battle here we go (81:21 - 81:24)
and then all of a sudden it's like oh (81:22 - 81:26)
they have like three Rock Pokemon this (81:24 - 81:27)
like and I have three fire I'm like at (81:26 - 81:29)
the disadvantage and you lose and then (81:27 - 81:31)
you have to do it again and it's just (81:29 - 81:35)
RNG it's just rolling they are like it (81:31 - 81:38)
it I talked about this on the podcast of (81:35 - 81:39)
like you kind of have to like Eevee (81:38 - 81:40)
train these Pokemon and go out and (81:39 - 81:42)
obviously some Pokemon fit for both like (81:40 - 81:43)
if you got like a Malamar you can bring (81:42 - 81:45)
Malamar to both like the psychic one and (81:43 - 81:47)
the dark one because it fits that but (81:45 - 81:49)
that whole process of doing that took me (81:47 - 81:52)
like a solid two hours and I had a great (81:49 - 81:54)
time it was like again whatever 18 time (81:52 - 81:57)
3 is uh that many battles I think I lost (81:54 - 81:59)
twice because of you know bad matchups (81:57 - 82:01)
and then at the very end of that you get (81:59 - 82:03)
a shirt and now I'm now that I've (82:01 - 82:05)
explained that whole thing I promise you (82:03 - 82:07)
like 90% of the people listening to this (82:05 - 82:09)
podcast have no clue what I just (82:07 - 82:12)
described because they all skipped it (82:09 - 82:15)
this is the point I'm making I'm like (82:12 - 82:17)
should there be a battle tower or some (82:15 - 82:18)
sort of thing (82:17 - 82:22)
in the Indigo disc yes probably but like (82:18 - 82:26)
how many people are actually doing that (82:22 - 82:28)
and I think that's like the point of it (82:26 - 82:31)
is like why would they put the effort in (82:28 - 82:32)
when (82:31 - 82:35)
like no one's doing it they literally (82:32 - 82:37)
gave you a free shiny Dratini for doing (82:35 - 82:38)
it in black and white and like still no (82:37 - 82:40)
one did it the sword and shield one you (82:38 - 82:41)
had to do a certain amount of it to (82:40 - 82:44)
unlock the judge function didn't you (82:41 - 82:45)
yeah I think you had to run through it (82:44 - 82:47)
once that's that's all I (82:45 - 82:49)
did that's I I did that cuz I wanted the (82:47 - 82:51)
judge function and I was like this is (82:49 - 82:53)
stupid why do we have to do this I can't (82:51 - 82:55)
believe they're making me do this but I (82:53 - 82:57)
did actually do some of the the dojo um (82:55 - 83:00)
the master Dojo stuff but I got (82:57 - 83:02)
bored I did you know if you're not into (83:00 - 83:03)
battling you're not into battling but I (83:02 - 83:05)
feel like if you're really into battling (83:03 - 83:07)
I really wanted that shirt that's all (83:05 - 83:09)
I'm saying the shirt is cool yeah I know (83:07 - 83:11)
some people who are really really really (83:09 - 83:13)
into these battle towers and these (83:11 - 83:15)
battle facilities and then when I talk (83:13 - 83:17)
to them they're the ones who remind me (83:15 - 83:18)
that they (83:17 - 83:22)
exist yeah I am not into them I never (83:18 - 83:26)
have been I just I I I I remember I did (83:22 - 83:29)
like a when when scarlet and violet was (83:26 - 83:30)
coming out (83:29 - 83:33)
and I did a cross podcast with the guys (83:30 - 83:35)
over at game explain they were like (83:33 - 83:37)
super super nice and I remember going to (83:35 - 83:39)
their YouTube video after like my (83:37 - 83:40)
interview with them and we were talking (83:39 - 83:43)
about like difficulty in Pokemon games (83:40 - 83:45)
and I I I said something like for all (83:43 - 83:47)
these people that just want like more (83:45 - 83:48)
battles or harder battles they should (83:47 - 83:51)
just do competitive and I scrolled in (83:48 - 83:52)
the comments and it's like ah this guy (83:51 - 83:54)
does doesn't get it I don't want to do (83:52 - 83:55)
competitive I want to I want a battle (83:54 - 83:58)
tower but like I really don't understand (83:55 - 84:01)
like the reason I brought up with drton (83:58 - 84:07)
is because like I put Drayton in such a (84:01 - 84:09)
disadvantage (84:07 - 84:12)
that I didn't cheat I didn't use I (84:09 - 84:15)
literally just used the I I was at the (84:12 - 84:16)
disadvantage I was like two levels (84:15 - 84:19)
underr and actually like we were both (84:16 - 84:20)
eeve trained we both had heal items like (84:19 - 84:22)
we both used Pokemon caught in this (84:20 - 84:25)
region like we were on the the easiest (84:22 - 84:28)
levels of playing field (84:25 - 84:31)
but I just understand the mechanics of (84:28 - 84:33)
the game and that's not to that's not to (84:31 - 84:35)
shame or to make anyone feel bad for not (84:33 - 84:38)
understanding the mechanics but like I (84:35 - 84:40)
would have been at the disadvantage if I (84:38 - 84:43)
knocked out his Dragonite his Dragonite (84:40 - 84:45)
was dead weight but like that's what you (84:43 - 84:49)
would do in a competitive match like you (84:45 - 84:53)
don't knock out the thing like you you (84:49 - 84:55)
are giving them the free like in a trick (84:53 - 84:57)
in a trick room situation I don't know (84:55 - 84:58)
if you guys know this if somebody sets (84:57 - 85:01)
up trick room in a competitive match you (84:58 - 85:03)
don't attack well you you do but like (85:01 - 85:07)
you stall it out you don't want them to (85:03 - 85:09)
take advantage of their trick room teams (85:07 - 85:12)
so you start slow playing them in order (85:09 - 85:14)
to get the speed back to your advantage (85:12 - 85:17)
what a trick room you user normally (85:14 - 85:19)
wants is they want to set up trick room (85:17 - 85:21)
and they want you to knock them out so (85:19 - 85:22)
they get a free switch in so they take (85:21 - 85:24)
full advantage of their trick room (85:22 - 85:27)
that's how they win in trick room (85:24 - 85:30)
if if Drayton has to switch the (85:27 - 85:32)
Dragonite I am now at an advantage of (85:30 - 85:35)
like you need to swap back in and I have (85:32 - 85:38)
more turns like I you just don't get (85:35 - 85:40)
that against (85:38 - 85:42)
NPCs and even like people are like well (85:40 - 85:45)
in my hardcore Nuzlocke programmed (85:42 - 85:47)
whatever (85:45 - 85:50)
like yeah you program the AI to always (85:47 - 85:51)
use super effective or always to switch (85:50 - 85:54)
out but like most of those situations of (85:51 - 85:57)
like the hardcore BL Blaze Black (85:54 - 85:59)
Nuzlocke most of those situations are (85:57 - 86:01)
single battles they're not double (85:59 - 86:03)
battles and double battles are (86:01 - 86:05)
significantly more interesting so like (86:03 - 86:07)
they're they're more (86:05 - 86:10)
complicated uh (86:07 - 86:12)
so (86:10 - 86:15)
I if you want something to be (86:12 - 86:18)
harder just do the compet like you get (86:15 - 86:21)
unlimited matchups and it's always (86:18 - 86:24)
different whereas like a battle tower it (86:21 - 86:25)
can't unless game freak's going to (86:24 - 86:28)
program like infinite combos they just (86:25 - 86:30)
can't program infinite Combos and (86:28 - 86:33)
matchups and the AI is very complicated (86:30 - 86:35)
to program as well it's not it's not (86:33 - 86:36)
like oh I just oh you just do this and (86:35 - 86:38)
you do that right like it's there are so (86:36 - 86:40)
many because there's like hundreds of (86:38 - 86:42)
moves and hundreds of Pokemon hundreds (86:40 - 86:45)
of different there are 900 abilities in (86:42 - 86:47)
this game and then add in teror into (86:45 - 86:50)
that especially some newer Terror right (86:47 - 86:52)
it just complicates things massively (86:50 - 86:53)
like it's not not an easy problem to (86:52 - 86:56)
solve um and in an Ideal World we would (86:53 - 86:57)
all get all the features we want in all (86:56 - 87:00)
the games but I think game freak did a (86:57 - 87:03)
good job at like all of those NPCs and (87:00 - 87:05)
all the NPCs in the area like they all (87:03 - 87:08)
have double battle gimmicks and I don't (87:05 - 87:10)
think like their end goal is to be like (87:08 - 87:13)
man you lost to like Barbara over here (87:10 - 87:16)
in the coastal biome because she she (87:13 - 87:17)
caught you off guard I think the whole (87:16 - 87:19)
point of the these battles is to (87:17 - 87:21)
literally just show you the gimmick so (87:19 - 87:24)
you know like oh these two Pokemon (87:21 - 87:27)
interacted each other like when I like (87:24 - 87:28)
uh in in New York when I fought one of (87:27 - 87:33)
the random NPCs it was it was a rabska (87:28 - 87:36)
which had telepathy and then it what I (87:33 - 87:37)
can't remember what was standing next to (87:36 - 87:39)
it but it was like something that used (87:37 - 87:41)
explosion I think and it was like oh the (87:39 - 87:44)
rapsa didn't get hit because of its (87:41 - 87:45)
ability (87:44 - 87:47)
telepathy like it just like oh yeah I (87:45 - 87:49)
forgot that was a thing I forgot I (87:47 - 87:51)
forgot telepathy was a thing like seven (87:49 - 87:53)
Pokemon get telepathy like like you just (87:51 - 87:54)
you just don't think of it cuz there's (87:53 - 87:56)
so many abilities like so I'm sure (87:54 - 87:58)
somebody could be watching my stream and (87:56 - 87:59)
be like well Steve you actually cheated (87:58 - 88:01)
against Dron because you have two (87:59 - 88:03)
intimidate users on your team like no (88:01 - 88:07)
double intimidate is a very like like (88:03 - 88:09)
very powerful combination in competitive (88:07 - 88:12)
Pokemon that's why people run the (88:09 - 88:16)
ability competitive to counter double (88:12 - 88:18)
intimidate I do find it interesting (88:16 - 88:20)
there are a lot of double battle (88:18 - 88:22)
strategies but I also feel like half the (88:20 - 88:23)
battle (88:22 - 88:26)
half the Pokemon just had Focus sash um (88:23 - 88:29)
like I was constantly not quite knocking (88:26 - 88:31)
them out in the first turn but that's (88:29 - 88:33)
that's another thing competitive when (88:31 - 88:36)
you when you look at a team of six we (88:33 - 88:38)
like which one out of the six has Focus (88:36 - 88:41)
sash cuz one of them has (88:38 - 88:44)
FOC yeah I get that I get that it's just (88:41 - 88:45)
it was when it got to like the 12th (88:44 - 88:49)
battle and I was like it's another Focus (88:45 - 88:49)
sash you've got to teach over and over (88:50 - 88:56)
again that's how some people (88:53 - 88:56)
learn Focus sash STS again um but again (88:56 - 89:04)
I do think like if you want harder (89:02 - 89:06)
challenging stuff you should get into (89:04 - 89:10)
competitive I I but that's not me like I (89:06 - 89:12)
can I can say you should get into (89:10 - 89:13)
competitive you want challenges stuff (89:12 - 89:16)
but I can also say that there should be (89:13 - 89:18)
some sort of battle tower but then I (89:16 - 89:21)
should also say you should have a cool (89:18 - 89:23)
reward at the end of attle Tower so (89:21 - 89:25)
people who are not into (89:23 - 89:28)
battling feel somewhat incentivized like (89:25 - 89:31)
I don't think the shirt for the dojo was (89:28 - 89:34)
good enough but I also don't think the 6 (89:31 - 89:37)
IV Diglett that you get for collecting (89:34 - 89:39)
all the Diglett in the the in the the (89:37 - 89:41)
aisle of armor was also good (89:39 - 89:45)
enough like I think rewards need to do I (89:41 - 89:48)
think rewards need to be better for (89:45 - 89:52)
things that people might not be into but (89:48 - 89:55)
I think think the value in the battle (89:52 - 89:58)
tower is to slowly start getting people (89:55 - 90:00)
into a (89:58 - 90:04)
competitive or comfortable with battling (90:00 - 90:05)
I suspect that's the real loss here (90:04 - 90:08)
right like because it's and and they've (90:05 - 90:10)
tried to replace that with the the the (90:08 - 90:12)
strategies that they've shown in but (90:10 - 90:15)
it's not really the same in that like (90:12 - 90:17)
you're not having like very rarely are (90:15 - 90:21)
they like a 6v6 right or 4v4 as I think (90:17 - 90:24)
competitive tense is 44 is you go with (90:21 - 90:26)
six and you choose four um very rarely (90:24 - 90:28)
is it actually kind of set out in the (90:26 - 90:31)
same way so it's kind of half replacing (90:28 - 90:33)
that in terms of like getting people (90:31 - 90:35)
into the idea of competitive because it (90:33 - 90:38)
certainly is I suspect having never (90:35 - 90:40)
truly done competitive I suspect if you (90:38 - 90:41)
just jump into it you're just going to (90:40 - 90:43)
lose everything right you know you've (90:41 - 90:45)
got to figure out what you're doing and (90:43 - 90:48)
and a battl tower is a way that people (90:45 - 90:49)
could have done that in previous games (90:48 - 90:52)
and it's a little bit sad but you know I (90:49 - 90:55)
you say it's not it's complicated yeah I (90:52 - 90:56)
wouldn't say you would lose everything (90:55 - 90:59)
like Pokemon isn't like chess like (90:56 - 91:00)
there's no way somebody who's been (90:59 - 91:02)
playing chess for day one can beat a (91:00 - 91:05)
grandmas but if I was playing Pokemon (91:02 - 91:07)
for day one there is a chance that I (91:05 - 91:10)
could beat wolf click because I did beat (91:07 - 91:13)
W Glick by a trash can in black and (91:10 - 91:15)
white and I beat him because I paralyzed (91:13 - 91:17)
him and he kept getting fully paralyzed (91:15 - 91:19)
and then after I paralyzed him I spammed (91:17 - 91:22)
rockslide so I paralyzed flinched him (91:19 - 91:24)
over and over and I beat wolf click like (91:22 - 91:27)
I was ultimately like a day one VGC (91:24 - 91:30)
player in that tournament situation so (91:27 - 91:33)
like fair enough there there is the RNG (91:30 - 91:35)
aspect of Pokemon that makes it (91:33 - 91:37)
different than like a like I would say (91:35 - 91:39)
Pokemon is like a strategy game very (91:37 - 91:42)
strategic obviously but like not like (91:39 - 91:43)
chess (91:42 - 91:47)
where like there's no RNG in (91:43 - 91:47)
chess it depends if you're playing (91:48 - 91:51)
against chat GPT or not which just (91:50 - 91:53)
changes the rules of the game halfway (91:51 - 91:56)
through (91:53 - 91:56)
um uh here's a question I I is this the (91:57 - 92:02)
first games now where we have two Elite (92:01 - 92:04)
Fours in one (92:02 - 92:08)
game yes because even Gen 2 didn't have (92:04 - 92:09)
that right because it was it was just (92:08 - 92:12)
one Elite shared Elite Four yeah just I (92:09 - 92:13)
feel like I feel like that's not really (92:12 - 92:16)
being discussed either it's like the're (92:13 - 92:17)
both called Elite 4 as well it's not (92:16 - 92:20)
even like the Pala 1 is called something (92:17 - 92:21)
different and so technically it's not an (92:20 - 92:23)
elite 4 right they're both actually (92:21 - 92:25)
called Elite 4 just find that (92:23 - 92:28)
interesting well it's the Elite 4 (92:25 - 92:31)
Club yeah well also when you when you (92:28 - 92:35)
beat the Elite 4 the original tournament (92:31 - 92:37)
in Pala does get (92:35 - 92:41)
stronger um so their levels up for that (92:37 - 92:43)
so if you go back to (92:41 - 92:46)
the I the ace the ace Academy tournament (92:43 - 92:48)
I think it's called MH um that gets (92:46 - 92:51)
upgraded there there is and then like (92:48 - 92:53)
you know what I think they actually kind (92:51 - 92:56)
of did to like replace the battle tower (92:53 - 92:58)
or not replace it but I think their (92:56 - 93:01)
justification is you can summon the gym (92:58 - 93:04)
leaders to your Club room and you can (93:01 - 93:05)
battle them that way and you can trade (93:04 - 93:08)
with them and I I think that's maybe the (93:05 - 93:10)
substitute but (93:08 - 93:16)
like I am very reward driven in games so (93:10 - 93:19)
if it's like what do I get if I battle (93:16 - 93:22)
all the trainers in Pala oh I get like (93:19 - 93:24)
one Ability capsule I'm not interested (93:22 - 93:26)
but if you were to tell me like oh you (93:24 - 93:27)
get like a hat that you'll probably (93:26 - 93:29)
never wear I want the hat that I will (93:27 - 93:33)
never wear like I I I want that but they (93:29 - 93:35)
which is like a really weird way of (93:33 - 93:38)
thinking like I wanted the mustard shirt (93:35 - 93:40)
in the dojo did I ever equip the mustard (93:38 - 93:43)
shirt no but I have (93:40 - 93:47)
it in Legends archus if you do the 50 (93:43 - 93:50)
battles to battle and defeat archus you (93:47 - 93:53)
get a little stamp on your trainer card (93:50 - 93:56)
it's literally a gold stamp and I wanted (93:53 - 94:00)
it so badly it doesn't do anything but I (93:56 - 94:01)
got the (94:00 - 94:05)
stamp yeah sometimes the idea of having (94:01 - 94:07)
it any having done it anyway right like (94:05 - 94:09)
that's why people do things like (94:07 - 94:11)
Professor Oak challenges and nuzlock and (94:09 - 94:13)
stuff it's the very aspect of having (94:11 - 94:16)
said hey I did this and sometimes it's (94:13 - 94:18)
the fact that you can only get that item (94:16 - 94:20)
by doing that one specific thing you can (94:18 - 94:22)
only get that stamp by doing one (94:20 - 94:23)
specific thing if it was an Ability (94:22 - 94:25)
capsule that's completely different (94:23 - 94:29)
right you can get that in so many places (94:25 - 94:31)
um okay speaking of places there's the (94:29 - 94:35)
club room uh this is where you can uh (94:31 - 94:37)
spend your BP this is where you can (94:35 - 94:41)
invite gym leaders from Pala over after (94:37 - 94:44)
you I think after you get credits um or (94:41 - 94:46)
at least after you beat Kieran I think (94:44 - 94:48)
it's after credits though uh you can (94:46 - 94:50)
change the room there's like eight (94:48 - 94:52)
different things you can change the (94:50 - 94:58)
music you can access the Roto loto thing (94:52 - 95:01)
not Roto loto that's Roto loto is H sun (94:58 - 95:02)
and moon if (95:01 - 95:04)
I the (95:02 - 95:07)
item printer I believe it's (95:04 - 95:10)
called Uh there's a lot in this room I (95:07 - 95:11)
think it's I think it's really cool I (95:10 - 95:14)
was I was surprised that the school was (95:11 - 95:17)
a school uh they hit the old command C (95:14 - 95:19)
command V and they did the same thing in (95:17 - 95:22)
the Pala school there's multiple floors (95:19 - 95:23)
I was curious if there was like a (95:22 - 95:25)
working elevator in the school there is (95:23 - 95:27)
I didn't see that in my Nintendo preview (95:25 - 95:29)
they only showed me the (95:27 - 95:32)
Dome itself but there are places to go (95:29 - 95:34)
none of those places are a battle tower (95:32 - 95:36)
or anything but there could have been (95:34 - 95:38)
there could have been the floor for the (95:36 - 95:41)
battle tower they opted not to do that (95:38 - 95:43)
yeah yeah it's interesting as well (95:41 - 95:44)
because when you first arrive you you (95:43 - 95:45)
you arrive at the top and then you go (95:44 - 95:47)
down to the terrarium and it's like at (95:45 - 95:49)
that point I was like oh this is all it (95:47 - 95:50)
is isn't it and then you do some more (95:49 - 95:51)
and then it's like no no there's more (95:50 - 95:52)
more and you're like oh wow there (95:51 - 95:54)
actually is more I was totally expecting (95:52 - 95:56)
it just to be this dome but when you go (95:54 - 95:58)
down to the terrarium you can see that (95:56 - 95:59)
there's more there's a map it doesn't (95:58 - 96:01)
really makes sense but there is a map (95:59 - 96:03)
there's a there's a there's a graphic I (96:01 - 96:05)
wouldn't really call it a map nothing is (96:03 - 96:07)
nothing is labeled on it to start with (96:05 - 96:10)
it's like hey (96:07 - 96:12)
things that doesn't mean there are (96:10 - 96:14)
things (96:12 - 96:17)
there there really is copy pasted though (96:14 - 96:18)
the classrooms are the same the dorm (96:17 - 96:20)
rooms are the same the dorm room is (96:18 - 96:23)
almost it's identical just blue I found (96:20 - 96:25)
that was really cuz like I only went in (96:23 - 96:27)
there there's a point where you get put (96:25 - 96:29)
in there and I'm like okay apparently (96:27 - 96:31)
I'm in here and I'm like are we sure (96:29 - 96:32)
this is blueberry Academy oh yes of (96:31 - 96:35)
course we are because it's blue that's (96:32 - 96:36)
how we know it's the blueberry Academy (96:35 - 96:38)
it's got the digital (96:36 - 96:41)
wall yeah yeah (96:38 - 96:44)
um there's there's a there's a cook in (96:41 - 96:47)
the cafeteria that has four items and (96:44 - 96:50)
they're really great they cost BP which (96:47 - 96:54)
we'll get to in a second of that but um (96:50 - 96:56)
the one that stands out is the one (96:54 - 96:58)
that's like 150 BP it's like the (96:56 - 97:00)
All-American meal except replace burger (96:58 - 97:03)
with bowl of ramen but it's like it's (97:00 - 97:07)
like Ramen french fries like a cup of (97:03 - 97:09)
soda there's like an all french fry meal (97:07 - 97:12)
a all Sunday meal I don't remember the (97:09 - 97:14)
first one deep dish pizza I think oh (97:12 - 97:16)
yeah the pizza and then the last one is (97:14 - 97:19)
like the non-american one but they still (97:16 - 97:20)
tried to like American like it makes (97:19 - 97:22)
sense that they're American cuz you're (97:20 - 97:27)
in ultimately the New York area um but (97:22 - 97:28)
that one has this is where the (97:27 - 97:30)
non-american says that Ramen is just as (97:28 - 97:33)
American as a burger right yeah (97:30 - 97:36)
yeah there was no jelly fil doughnut (97:33 - 97:39)
option that I'm so used (97:36 - 97:42)
to uh the that one's probably the most (97:39 - 97:44)
interesting CU it has shiny power one (97:42 - 97:47)
for everything which is just one extra (97:44 - 97:51)
roll this is very similar to the incense (97:47 - 97:53)
in in let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee (97:51 - 97:55)
like you should probably always have an (97:53 - 97:56)
incense on because it's just a plus one (97:55 - 97:59)
to the shiny roll that mean a big (97:56 - 98:00)
throwback big reference there they've (97:59 - 98:02)
done this (98:00 - 98:04)
before but the the more interesting (98:02 - 98:06)
thing about that one is not only is it (98:04 - 98:10)
plus one all shiny it's a plus two catch (98:06 - 98:13)
power so you if you are filling your (98:10 - 98:16)
Pokedex listener pull over in your car (98:13 - 98:18)
think about this for a second if you are (98:16 - 98:20)
actively catching Pokemon to fill your (98:18 - 98:22)
Pokedex you should always have this (98:20 - 98:23)
running because not only is it going to (98:22 - 98:24)
increase your shining chance but it's (98:23 - 98:26)
just going to make catching Pokemon (98:24 - 98:31)
easier cuz it's catch power too um so (98:26 - 98:32)
yeah I (98:31 - 98:35)
think that's all things considered it's (98:32 - 98:38)
not that expensive either yeah yeah um I (98:35 - 98:40)
think it's very easy to get more than (98:38 - 98:45)
150 even by yourself in a half hour um (98:40 - 98:46)
assuming you're looking way less than (98:45 - 98:47)
that way less than that cuz you want (98:46 - 98:49)
most of the like (98:47 - 98:53)
10 the the the special BBQs are 150 and (98:49 - 98:55)
you only need to do 10 to get to them (98:53 - 98:56)
which is very (98:55 - 99:00)
fast um this is the F it's interesting I (98:56 - 99:02)
think because the automatic thing I (99:00 - 99:03)
certainly thought when I saw it was oh (99:02 - 99:04)
it's only shiny level one oh I'm not (99:03 - 99:07)
going to bother then but like compared (99:04 - 99:11)
to making a sandwich with heram mystica (99:07 - 99:14)
right like yes it is fewer extra roles (99:11 - 99:17)
but it's also you can just infinitely do (99:14 - 99:19)
this right trying to get herb Mystic is (99:17 - 99:22)
quite hard and as you say it does stuff (99:19 - 99:24)
as well and also the the the the extra (99:22 - 99:27)
shiny chance being on all types is that (99:24 - 99:30)
unique to this item it is unique yeah I (99:27 - 99:33)
mean it makes sense for the whatever but (99:30 - 99:35)
um yeah I think that that's interest (99:33 - 99:36)
because just my initial thought and I (99:35 - 99:38)
suspect M multiple other people would do (99:36 - 99:39)
the same is just like I'm not going to (99:38 - 99:40)
bother with that but then when you (99:39 - 99:41)
actually think about the fact that (99:40 - 99:44)
there's all types and because of herb (99:41 - 99:46)
mystica being really difficult still to (99:44 - 99:48)
get you know it's actually a really good (99:46 - 99:50)
deal so I think it's interesting because (99:48 - 99:53)
at the start of this podcast Al you said (99:50 - 99:55)
I think it's kind of icky that the (99:53 - 99:58)
flying is behind a pay wall which I I (99:55 - 100:01)
totally am not disagreeing with you but (99:58 - 100:03)
you could also point to this and say (100:01 - 100:05)
this is such a (100:03 - 100:09)
good thing yeah it feels different to me (100:05 - 100:13)
because the flying feels like fixing a (100:09 - 100:15)
bad feature already right like the (100:13 - 100:17)
traversal and especially the gliding is (100:15 - 100:19)
just bad right even if you like these (100:17 - 100:21)
games I love these games I really do (100:19 - 100:24)
like I legitimately love these games but (100:21 - 100:27)
the traversal is just bad and the flying (100:24 - 100:30)
makes a lot of it bearable right whereas (100:27 - 100:31)
this is like I you know I don't think (100:30 - 100:33)
you should say no because because if you (100:31 - 100:35)
go oh well good things can't go behind (100:33 - 100:37)
DLC then you just end up well the (100:35 - 100:40)
nothing behinds the DLC then right I (100:37 - 100:43)
think I think the teal mask is that like (100:40 - 100:46)
what do the like I don't like (100:43 - 100:48)
unless this is why you get them in a (100:46 - 100:50)
package this is why you only pay once (100:48 - 100:52)
for the both of them yeah I mean I guess (100:50 - 100:55)
that's why like last week I was like it (100:52 - 100:57)
almost feels like the flying should have (100:55 - 101:01)
been in the teal mask and like sure like (100:57 - 101:03)
you know amoris has to give you flying (101:01 - 101:05)
again for the Dome when you finish it (101:03 - 101:08)
but there are so many little things in (101:05 - 101:11)
the Indigo disc the the item printer the (101:08 - 101:13)
the cafeteria the whole cafeteria like (101:11 - 101:14)
everything in the cafeteria is pretty (101:13 - 101:17)
great um the the flying there are so (101:14 - 101:20)
many things in the there's more stuff (101:17 - 101:22)
I'm just those are top three that that (101:20 - 101:25)
are in the Indigo disc specifically that (101:22 - 101:28)
does make it worth it if you like these (101:25 - 101:31)
games and you want more right I don't (101:28 - 101:34)
think the teal mask does any of that (101:31 - 101:36)
like the teal mask has like new Pokemon (101:34 - 101:39)
and a new area but like yeah it doesn't (101:36 - 101:43)
even like the PC getting fixed was not a (101:39 - 101:46)
teal Mass specific it was no it was (101:43 - 101:48)
upate the the thing that was said both (101:46 - 101:51)
on this podcast and many places was like (101:48 - 101:53)
oh if you like the games this is just (101:51 - 101:55)
more of the games with the te mask right (101:53 - 101:58)
and and I think that's a very fair (101:55 - 102:00)
assessment of that whereas this feels (101:58 - 102:03)
like it's more of it but also improves (102:00 - 102:08)
it in some ways that are DLC specific um (102:03 - 102:09)
the ultra the ultra versions the (102:08 - 102:13)
Platinum the the crystal yeah yeah sure (102:09 - 102:15)
um (102:13 - 102:18)
it's yeah I just I think it's you're (102:15 - 102:21)
right the the the teil mass didn't add (102:18 - 102:24)
features it added story and it added (102:21 - 102:27)
Pokemon whereas this adds story and (102:24 - 102:30)
Pokemon and features yeah the teal mask (102:27 - 102:33)
was a necessary story point to get to (102:30 - 102:34)
this but it didn't add that much else (102:33 - 102:36)
and when I was thinking about the kind (102:34 - 102:40)
of how I felt after playing each of them (102:36 - 102:42)
playing the base game and playing (102:40 - 102:44)
blueberry Academy playing the Indigo (102:42 - 102:46)
disc feels like reading a good book or (102:44 - 102:50)
binge watching a good show or just going (102:46 - 102:52)
on a vacation you feel like you've been (102:50 - 102:53)
somewhere you feel like you've been (102:52 - 102:55)
somewhere and then you when you finish (102:53 - 102:56)
it you're coming back to the present day (102:55 - 102:59)
and where you're at at least for me and (102:56 - 103:01)
the teal mask didn't feel like that it (102:59 - 103:03)
felt like oh this is this is what it is (103:01 - 103:06)
this is kind of short this is kind of (103:03 - 103:10)
small but the Indigo dis adds stuff to a (103:06 - 103:13)
completely new level it's almost a whole (103:10 - 103:14)
new it's it's not almost a whole new (103:13 - 103:18)
game but it's it's a lot more yeah I I I (103:14 - 103:20)
just I also can't think of a situation (103:18 - 103:22)
where somebody goes I like the teal mask (103:20 - 103:25)
more than the Indigo disc there's one (103:22 - 103:28)
reason and that's (103:25 - 103:28)
ogon (103:28 - 103:31)
yeah I thought you were going to say (103:30 - 103:34)
ogre Ting and I was like oh yeah I guess (103:31 - 103:36)
you could be really into ogre Ting no no (103:34 - 103:40)
no no just ogrean just ogrean on her own (103:36 - 103:42)
yeah I mean ogrean is she's a queen (103:40 - 103:44)
she's a fantastic Pokemon hands down I (103:42 - 103:46)
just think (103:44 - 103:49)
like the area is better in the Indigo (103:46 - 103:51)
disc I think all the features it ads are (103:49 - 103:56)
better I think the the Elite 4 is more (103:51 - 103:59)
fun and interesting than like the (103:56 - 104:04)
three uh the lousy 3 the lousy 3 yeah (103:59 - 104:07)
like those battles were fun but not as (104:04 - 104:09)
fun I think is the elite four um the a (104:07 - 104:12)
saluna one I think was oh yeah that's (104:09 - 104:15)
true the a saluna one was pretty (104:12 - 104:18)
solid uh I know Greg really liked the (104:15 - 104:19)
the the rich people story line which I (104:18 - 104:21)
didn't get a chance to to yeah but (104:19 - 104:23)
that's I mean that's only technically (104:21 - 104:25)
like it's like the first part is in (104:23 - 104:27)
kitami and then it's not goes back to (104:25 - 104:29)
pal (104:27 - 104:32)
yeah um you uh you did you both get a (104:29 - 104:35)
chance to use the item (104:32 - 104:35)
printer I used it quite a bit yep it's (104:35 - 104:42)
it's good I really like it my only real (104:39 - 104:44)
complaint about it is I don't know why (104:42 - 104:47)
they're so why they really don't want us (104:44 - 104:50)
to get Bank balls right like it's yeah (104:47 - 104:52)
this is probably one of the highest (104:50 - 104:54)
chances you can get in anything since (104:52 - 104:57)
they were properly introduced but it's (104:54 - 105:02)
still uh one in 1,000 chance to get a 2% (104:57 - 105:05)
chance at getting each of the balls (105:02 - 105:07)
right like it's an absolutely tiny (105:05 - 105:08)
chance of getting any of the specific (105:07 - 105:11)
balls and they're really and it's like (105:08 - 105:13)
again and again every game they seem to (105:11 - 105:15)
give us a way to get these balls but (105:13 - 105:17)
it's basically impossible to farm them (105:15 - 105:19)
and I'm I'm really fascinated as to why (105:17 - 105:21)
they're so protective of these balls may (105:19 - 105:24)
I introduce you to shiny locking we can (105:21 - 105:27)
talk about we can talk about that in a (105:24 - 105:29)
second um so yeah serby says that it's a (105:27 - 105:33)
0.1% chance to activate the chance of (105:29 - 105:36)
getting the RO the Pokeball loto and I (105:33 - 105:39)
think that's confusing to some people (105:36 - 105:40)
because I don't know anyone who's doing (105:39 - 105:44)
a single role everyone is probably doing (105:40 - 105:48)
the 10 roll you should be and that's why (105:44 - 105:50)
it feels like it's happening more often (105:48 - 105:53)
often because you look at like the 0.1% (105:50 - 105:54)
and you're like well that doesn't make (105:53 - 105:56)
sense it's like well yeah because you're (105:54 - 105:57)
probably not doing a single roll you're (105:56 - 106:01)
probably doing a 10 roll um but yeah (105:57 - 106:03)
once the and then I saw some people be (106:01 - 106:05)
like I don't want to upgrade my thing (106:03 - 106:08)
fully because I don't want to get less (106:05 - 106:10)
apricorn balls that's not how it (106:08 - 106:15)
works you like the Stellar shards that (106:10 - 106:17)
go into it from the master ball rank cuz (106:15 - 106:19)
so the the machine upgrades I posted a (106:17 - 106:21)
graphic on Instagram and Twitter and all (106:19 - 106:22)
that stuff of like what you need to do (106:21 - 106:24)
to upgrade it's not spoilery um it's (106:22 - 106:25)
just like you need to do these (106:24 - 106:27)
requirements to upgrade it when you get (106:25 - 106:28)
it to master ball rank the only thing (106:27 - 106:31)
adds is Stellar charts that's also not a (106:28 - 106:32)
spoiler because we know there's a 19 (106:31 - 106:34)
terot type they literally told us that (106:32 - 106:36)
like four months ago there it's called (106:34 - 106:40)
Stellar the name though Stellar type is (106:36 - 106:44)
the name um oddly enough still very (106:40 - 106:46)
confusing unless you actually look up (106:44 - 106:48)
what it's doing it's it's not very clear (106:46 - 106:50)
in battle of how it works um anyway (106:48 - 106:52)
anyways the the master ball gets you (106:50 - 106:53)
stellar and I saw some people be like I (106:52 - 106:54)
don't want to upgrade cuz I don't want (106:53 - 106:56)
Stellar type I don't want it to ruin my (106:54 - 106:58)
apricorn balls that that's not how it (106:56 - 107:01)
works yeah so when you do the rolls the (106:58 - 107:04)
machine will trigger into a different (107:01 - 107:07)
mode so that is so separate from the (107:04 - 107:10)
actual item drops if it triggers into (107:07 - 107:13)
Pokeball Lotto then you're only going to (107:10 - 107:16)
get pokeballs nothing else and then that (107:13 - 107:18)
has its own roles where like master ball (107:16 - 107:22)
is like a half a percent uh luxury ball (107:18 - 107:25)
is like 5% Poke Ball is like 5% um (107:22 - 107:29)
Safari Ball is like 1% right like there (107:25 - 107:32)
upgrade your upgrade it fully it's fine (107:29 - 107:34)
like don't it's so much it's so much (107:32 - 107:36)
cheaper to run it at full right and that (107:34 - 107:37)
was the first thing I did I was like I (107:36 - 107:39)
am upgrading this to Max and it's like (107:37 - 107:43)
it goes from was it 50 to like 20 Battle (107:39 - 107:47)
Points batt points points Five Points a (107:43 - 107:50)
roll but 10 rolls is like 50 and then it (107:47 - 107:52)
it gets down to like three points a roll (107:50 - 107:54)
I think at the master ball yeah um and (107:52 - 107:56)
and the the each of the items you put in (107:54 - 108:00)
to get the a th% if you're doing the 10 (107:56 - 108:02)
which you should always do the 10 um (108:00 - 108:04)
like increases as well like each of them (108:02 - 108:07)
is worth more of that as you upgrade (108:04 - 108:10)
it yeah I I just think the apricorn ball (108:07 - 108:12)
situation is they know that people love (108:10 - 108:16)
these and while it was this this is like (108:12 - 108:18)
the monster hunter thing all over again (108:16 - 108:20)
where like when Monster Hunter went from (108:18 - 108:21)
Monster h generations of Monster Hunter (108:20 - 108:24)
World they made some things really easy (108:21 - 108:25)
comparative and then they made some (108:24 - 108:27)
things really hard and the Monster (108:25 - 108:29)
Hunter fandom was like blah this used to (108:27 - 108:31)
be easier and now it's hard and this (108:29 - 108:32)
thing that used to be easy is now hard (108:31 - 108:34)
and this is used to be hard but now it's (108:32 - 108:35)
easy (108:34 - 108:37)
like it's their game they can change the (108:35 - 108:39)
balance at some point game freak (108:37 - 108:41)
realized like oh people really like (108:39 - 108:43)
these and we can get more gameplay out (108:41 - 108:46)
of them SL we can get them to do this (108:43 - 108:48)
slash we can add a (108:46 - 108:52)
mechanic that you come back to to do it (108:48 - 108:54)
like I I like the whole point of the (108:52 - 108:57)
loto machine is yes you can get apricorn (108:54 - 108:58)
balls and that's probably the coolest (108:57 - 109:02)
item you can get but it it is the (108:58 - 109:06)
economy that they created with like you (109:02 - 109:09)
need Pokemon parts you need like Pokemon (109:06 - 109:11)
liver and Pokemon feet and Pokemon like (109:09 - 109:14)
eyeballs and like you have to put those (109:11 - 109:16)
into the machine to grind it but then (109:14 - 109:18)
you have to go back out in the world do (109:16 - 109:19)
the let's go feature do the battle (109:18 - 109:22)
feature while you're doing BBQs to get (109:19 - 109:24)
points like they just built their own (109:22 - 109:28)
economy into the game yeah my point is (109:24 - 109:32)
like I guess the with how rare they are (109:28 - 109:34)
it makes me not want to do it right if (109:32 - 109:37)
it was like a higher percentage like (109:34 - 109:39)
that's the you know as I've mentioned (109:37 - 109:40)
before I'm a collector I like collecting (109:39 - 109:42)
things so I like getting Pokemon in (109:40 - 109:44)
different balls right and the thing is (109:42 - 109:47)
if I could go back and like spend an (109:44 - 109:49)
hour doing it and know I'm probably (109:47 - 109:51)
going to get 10 of each ball I would (109:49 - 109:53)
absolutely spend that hour doing it but (109:51 - 109:54)
I'm probably going to spend that hour (109:53 - 109:57)
doing it and maybe get two not two of (109:54 - 110:00)
each two two of the bank balls right (109:57 - 110:01)
like they're they're just they're still (110:00 - 110:03)
so incredibly rare that it just makes me (110:01 - 110:05)
go I I can't be bothered wasting the (110:03 - 110:08)
time to do this you (110:05 - 110:11)
know but I think like this leads into (110:08 - 110:12)
the second part about like keeping them (110:11 - 110:14)
rare is (110:12 - 110:18)
like I mean I I I I guess I like the (110:14 - 110:19)
three of us are lucky because we're in (110:18 - 110:21)
like a Discord and a slack community (110:19 - 110:23)
that loves Pokémon but like I just (110:21 - 110:26)
remember like every sevenstar raid like (110:23 - 110:27)
Greninja for example I caught Greninja (110:26 - 110:30)
in a love ball and then people in our (110:27 - 110:32)
communities like caught in like lur ball (110:30 - 110:34)
beastball friend ball and then all of a (110:32 - 110:36)
sudden like after that raid is gone (110:34 - 110:38)
people are like hey does anyone have a (110:36 - 110:40)
Froakie in a beast ball like yeah let me (110:38 - 110:42)
breed you one oh I caught mine in a a (110:40 - 110:43)
heavy ball let me trade you my heavy (110:42 - 110:45)
ball Froakie for your beastball Froakie (110:43 - 110:47)
and like it encourages like the trading (110:45 - 110:49)
I think there is like whether you love (110:47 - 110:51)
it or hate it I think I think there is (110:49 - 110:54)
somewhat of a responsibility to like I (110:51 - 110:56)
don't know if responsibility is (110:54 - 110:57)
definitely not the right word but (110:56 - 111:01)
like you want to make trade like it does (110:57 - 111:03)
add to the value of trading whatever the (111:01 - 111:07)
value is is subjective but like I I (111:03 - 111:08)
don't know you just sound like the (111:07 - 111:09)
people that say that shinies are too (111:08 - 111:11)
common now that's that's what it feels (111:09 - 111:12)
like to me right like oh we can't make (111:11 - 111:14)
them more common because then people (111:12 - 111:17)
will have them you know but I think like (111:14 - 111:19)
you want to encourage trading in some (111:17 - 111:21)
instances yeah but that doesn't mean (111:19 - 111:22)
they have to be as rare as they are (111:21 - 111:24)
right they can still like if if you if (111:22 - 111:26)
you spend an hour and get 10 of each of (111:24 - 111:27)
them I'm still probably not going to do (111:26 - 111:29)
that for all of them right like we have (111:27 - 111:31)
a a group of people who've been doing we (111:29 - 111:33)
did we started in sword and shield and (111:31 - 111:34)
we started getting as many of the (111:33 - 111:36)
Pokemon in the bank balls as (111:34 - 111:38)
possible but at some point you're like I (111:36 - 111:41)
just we just can't get anymore right you (111:38 - 111:43)
have it like takes so much time to get (111:41 - 111:46)
them that it becomes basically not (111:43 - 111:49)
impossible but it's not fun (111:46 - 111:52)
anymore it's better than the kar an the (111:49 - 111:56)
CR sure but that's like that's a huge (111:52 - 111:58)
that's not saying much yeah I you know I (111:56 - 112:00)
don't know because like I I think I (111:58 - 112:03)
think ever since we made the jump to (112:00 - 112:05)
Scarlet so sorry ever since we made the (112:03 - 112:07)
jump to switch I think they did change a (112:05 - 112:10)
lot to how their economy works and when (112:07 - 112:12)
I say economy I just don't think I don't (112:10 - 112:15)
I'm not saying Pokey dollars when I say (112:12 - 112:18)
economy I I do think of like the value (112:15 - 112:21)
of Pokemon the shiny (112:18 - 112:25)
uh um like items like ability patch like (112:21 - 112:29)
Star pieces like there's a lot of (112:25 - 112:32)
like unlike a game like GTA where like (112:29 - 112:35)
GTA the economy is actually the (112:32 - 112:37)
money that's why you're playing GTA (112:35 - 112:39)
online is like the money is actually the (112:37 - 112:41)
economy in this game you could argue (112:39 - 112:43)
that like like I could make a trade with (112:41 - 112:45)
Al and be like hey Al can I get a love (112:43 - 112:48)
ball I'll trade you a shiny Hound hour (112:45 - 112:50)
is like is and Al might be like yeah (112:48 - 112:51)
that's a fair trade like I would love (112:50 - 112:53)
the shiny Hound hour I don't care about (112:51 - 112:56)
the love ball so I do think in the sense (112:53 - 112:57)
if you think about like the apricorn (112:56 - 113:00)
balls in the sense of like would you (112:57 - 113:04)
trade your extra maridon (113:00 - 113:07)
for um uh a beast ball because you can (113:04 - 113:09)
only get one Beast ball well I think you (113:07 - 113:10)
get two Beast balls in this game now (113:09 - 113:12)
well before the Roto loto I think you (113:10 - 113:13)
can only get one like some people might (113:12 - 113:15)
do that trade because they would be like (113:13 - 113:18)
oh I have two maridon I don't need two I (113:15 - 113:19)
would definitely like another Beast Ball (113:18 - 113:21)
but then you could like logistically go (113:19 - 113:23)
well I can just go back to Sun and Moon (113:21 - 113:25)
and I could get unlimited Beast balls (113:23 - 113:29)
but I also can't catch uh Nimble in Sun (113:25 - 113:33)
and Moon MH so I think they are really (113:29 - 113:35)
playing with the the concept of like all (113:33 - 113:40)
of the these things are worth something (113:35 - 113:42)
I get that I get that it just it's I I (113:40 - 113:44)
it's it feels frustrating because it's (113:42 - 113:47)
like a g another another game where (113:44 - 113:48)
they're incredibly rare right like it's (113:47 - 113:50)
not so many things it's it's like oh (113:48 - 113:52)
yeah it's rare but then it's easier and (113:50 - 113:54)
then it's harder and you know whatever (113:52 - 113:56)
but like I don't think since heart gold (113:54 - 113:59)
soul silver have you been able to get (113:56 - 114:02)
them consistently and easily easily so (113:59 - 114:04)
yeah that's the thing if they do a a (114:02 - 114:05)
jotto (114:04 - 114:09)
remake let's go jto Legends (114:05 - 114:13)
celby 2 ultra Edition when that comes (114:09 - 114:15)
out which I'm sure it will it'll have (114:13 - 114:18)
all the regions too mark my words maybe (114:15 - 114:19)
that's what they're waiting for maybe (114:18 - 114:21)
that's why yeah who knows but it's just (114:19 - 114:23)
a bit frustrating I think is my thing (114:21 - 114:25)
like I I like I think it's actually it's (114:23 - 114:28)
way better than the camatic right the (114:25 - 114:32)
the the the item and printer and I've (114:28 - 114:33)
had a lot of fun doing it right like (114:32 - 114:35)
I've done a lot the (114:33 - 114:38)
flab uh outbreaks were particularly good (114:35 - 114:40)
because you can max out the FL baby (114:38 - 114:42)
stuff really easily shiny hunting them (114:40 - 114:43)
and then you go throw them in the item (114:42 - 114:46)
printer but yeah I think it's just that (114:43 - 114:48)
one thing that's really it's just like (114:46 - 114:51)
so incredibly rare but that's probably a (114:48 - 114:52)
specific thing to a specific kind of (114:51 - 114:54)
person again like I I don't think I (114:52 - 114:56)
don't I think you are speaking for the (114:54 - 114:59)
majority of at least vocal people like (114:56 - 115:02)
remember when oh no do I want to do that (114:59 - 115:05)
remember when the crown the aisle of (115:02 - 115:06)
armor was coming out and people were (115:05 - 115:07)
like oh my gosh they're going to make it (115:06 - 115:09)
so easy to get apricorn balls and like I (115:07 - 115:11)
I think I said this in like my preview (115:09 - 115:13)
video of like they never said that they (115:11 - 115:15)
literally never said that like I I have (115:13 - 115:17)
the screenshot of it flashing on screen (115:15 - 115:19)
just saying like apricorn like I think (115:17 - 115:20)
all it says is like apricorn balls it (115:19 - 115:23)
doesn't say like easy or more um and (115:20 - 115:24)
then people were mad because it was in (115:23 - 115:27)
the cromatic and it wasn't like you (115:24 - 115:28)
could still get them you could sit there (115:27 - 115:30)
like with a turbo controller and get (115:28 - 115:31)
them look like if you want unlimited (115:30 - 115:33)
master balls just wonder trade like you (115:31 - 115:35)
get them like it's fine like there is (115:33 - 115:37)
there is (115:35 - 115:40)
like there is like an economy in this (115:37 - 115:42)
game but not like people haven't like (115:40 - 115:44)
just hacked whatever they wanted into (115:42 - 115:45)
these games anyways but like however you (115:44 - 115:47)
play your game right like I'm not here (115:45 - 115:49)
to if you want to wonder trade from (115:47 - 115:51)
zashi and (115:49 - 115:56)
go go do that that's fine um I don't (115:51 - 115:58)
care all the (115:56 - 115:59)
choices (115:58 - 116:03)
dog mchs.org I don't know like go do (115:59 - 116:05)
that (116:03 - 116:08)
uh the government zachian is out here (116:05 - 116:10)
giving free master balls you won't (116:08 - 116:13)
believe but like I do think about that (116:10 - 116:16)
of like apricorn balls (116:13 - 116:19)
like people are very vocal about them (116:16 - 116:20)
it's very clear that like people like (116:19 - 116:22)
them for as much as people like go like (116:20 - 116:25)
G freak doesn't listen oh no they do (116:22 - 116:27)
they just trolled everyone with a gimme (116:25 - 116:31)
ghou like they definitely listen and pay (116:27 - 116:32)
attention like they they know they're (116:31 - 116:34)
not out of touch like I think the reason (116:32 - 116:36)
they upped the amount of sandwich (116:34 - 116:37)
ingredients through Mystery Gift is (116:36 - 116:39)
because you all were complaining about (116:37 - 116:40)
it and they were like you know what (116:39 - 116:43)
we're giving them next week more lettuce (116:40 - 116:46)
enjoy it trainers get your Lett out (116:43 - 116:48)
lettuce now right I don't need no more (116:46 - 116:51)
lettuce they definitely pay attention to (116:48 - 116:53)
this stuff like that is also that's why (116:51 - 116:54)
there's like certain Pokemon (116:53 - 116:56)
combinations or certain Pokemon standing (116:54 - 116:58)
next to each other or like the wh Lord (116:56 - 117:01)
and skiddy like they know like there's a (116:58 - 117:03)
giant wh Lord in the aisle of armor (117:01 - 117:04)
because people were complaining about (117:03 - 117:06)
Wailord size I don't think that was a (117:04 - 117:08)
coincidence I think game freak was like (117:06 - 117:09)
you want to complain about wh Lord (117:08 - 117:12)
here's a big wh Lord okay now shut up (117:09 - 117:14)
about wh Lord (117:12 - 117:17)
like like they're very in like I I know (117:14 - 117:18)
for sure they know that people want (117:17 - 117:20)
apricorn balls I am curious though is if (117:18 - 117:23)
we do ever get a Johto remake of (117:20 - 117:26)
whatever that is how are they going to (117:23 - 117:28)
handle that situation if they if they (117:26 - 117:30)
don't give us if it's not like it was (117:28 - 117:34)
I'm I will Riot right like that's my (117:30 - 117:36)
point there are many things I will just (117:34 - 117:38)
accept and I will just I will riot at (117:36 - 117:39)
that point I'm not saying I won't buy (117:38 - 117:41)
the games of course I will right I'm a (117:39 - 117:43)
sucker I will buy them I will play them (117:41 - 117:46)
but I will Riot about that (117:43 - 117:50)
yeah okay can I can I uh Al complaining (117:46 - 117:51)
about apricorn balls which is fine I (117:50 - 117:52)
want to complain about the Synchro (117:51 - 117:56)
machine I think it's (117:52 - 117:56)
bad God I feel (117:57 - 118:01)
like is this just so you don't have to (117:59 - 118:02)
admit that you were wrong last week this (118:01 - 118:06)
is the I 100% right last week I was 100% (118:02 - 118:10)
right last week and you guys had y all (118:06 - 118:12)
had high expectations I want to and they (118:10 - 118:15)
were met they were met is is the best (118:12 - 118:18)
feature that Pokemon has ever (118:15 - 118:21)
made more than I thought I (118:18 - 118:24)
would um so let me tell you about my (118:21 - 118:26)
experience with the indigo disc I spent (118:24 - 118:28)
the first two hours customizing my (118:26 - 118:30)
character with the new clothes because I (118:28 - 118:34)
was trying to match the Blues game freak (118:30 - 118:35)
maybe is slightly colorblind because (118:34 - 118:39)
their instance of teal and navy and blue (118:35 - 118:42)
are all different between stores it is (118:39 - 118:44)
so hard to match the very limited (118:42 - 118:46)
outfits you have in this game they added (118:44 - 118:48)
a cowboy hat by the way anyways I spent (118:46 - 118:50)
two hours going to every store looking (118:48 - 118:52)
at all the new items I'm not (118:50 - 118:54)
exaggerating that is my experience with (118:52 - 118:58)
the indigo disc I then after two hours (118:54 - 119:00)
of customizing my character I then spent (118:58 - 119:05)
90 minutes with the syn machine and (119:00 - 119:07)
every time I was like this is cool (119:05 - 119:09)
something would happen where I would be (119:07 - 119:11)
like this is no longer cool like or you (119:09 - 119:13)
can't jump and you fall into the water (119:11 - 119:15)
or you fall off a cliff and that that's (119:13 - 119:17)
probably like the biggest complaint is (119:15 - 119:20)
not being able to jump yeah yeah I love (119:17 - 119:23)
running around as my Meara my Meara is (119:20 - 119:26)
so fast and when I am doing BBQs I will (119:23 - 119:28)
absolutely just go and Synchro into my (119:26 - 119:31)
mcara to go and auto battle Pokemon (119:28 - 119:32)
pickup items because I can get those (119:31 - 119:36)
done in what feels like 20 seconds but I (119:32 - 119:40)
can't go up a ledge at all so I have to (119:36 - 119:43)
find a very flat piece of ground and if (119:40 - 119:46)
you're a flying Pokemon you cannot fly (119:43 - 119:51)
in a they they literally headed flying (119:46 - 119:55)
in this DLC and your Rayquaza just freef (119:51 - 119:58)
Falls that's it like those I feel like (119:55 - 120:01)
those two just I I feel like my (119:58 - 120:04)
complaint isn't the Synchro machine (120:01 - 120:06)
itself I think the concept and the (120:04 - 120:08)
novelty of the machine is (120:06 - 120:11)
cool but like the execution and for the (120:08 - 120:13)
somebody's going to be like typing on (120:11 - 120:15)
YouTube or in our Discord and be like (120:13 - 120:16)
well they said it was like a beta I (120:15 - 120:17)
don't know why I have a nerdy voice this (120:16 - 120:19)
episode well they they said it was a (120:17 - 120:21)
beta Pro like the girl tells you it's (120:19 - 120:24)
like beta or intesting but like your (120:21 - 120:28)
maridon can jump your maridon can fly it (120:24 - 120:31)
doesn't have your player character can't (120:28 - 120:33)
yeah sure but like you've not got the (120:31 - 120:34)
neurons to do that your player character (120:33 - 120:36)
can't get in three of the four doors to (120:34 - 120:39)
go into the Center Plaza in the (120:36 - 120:41)
terrarium because there's a ledge and (120:39 - 120:44)
you have to ride meon or kidon to get in (120:41 - 120:48)
there that's a great point that anyone (120:44 - 120:52)
walking in this game I bled (120:48 - 120:57)
some but like it does it does break that (120:52 - 120:59)
I don't know immersion they they want (120:57 - 121:01)
like the thing I get like the the (120:59 - 121:03)
question I got the most is like what's (121:01 - 121:05)
the point of the Synchro machine to have (121:03 - 121:07)
fun I mean like what's the what's the (121:05 - 121:09)
point of getting like 10 wins in (121:07 - 121:11)
fortnite like maybe you're updating your (121:09 - 121:13)
LinkedIn to be like I won fortnite 10 (121:11 - 121:16)
times but like there's like you're not (121:13 - 121:18)
getting anything in fortnite like (121:16 - 121:20)
everything in fortnite is like paid (121:18 - 121:21)
Cosmetics right like it doesn't matter (121:20 - 121:23)
whether you win or lose you're not (121:21 - 121:26)
like getting something for (121:23 - 121:28)
winning I somebody's going to maybe tell (121:26 - 121:29)
me I'm wrong maybe there's a new feature (121:28 - 121:31)
in fortnite where if you win you do get (121:29 - 121:32)
something but (121:31 - 121:34)
like I don't think you're getting like (121:32 - 121:35)
the rock skin for winning in fortnite (121:34 - 121:37)
you just got to buy the rock like that's (121:35 - 121:40)
all I maybe I'm I think the Rock is in (121:37 - 121:42)
fortnite I don't know is there anything (121:40 - 121:46)
not in fortnite I but like like one the (121:42 - 121:48)
well like the battling wild Pokemon and (121:46 - 121:51)
collecting things (121:48 - 121:53)
is faster there's no debate I mean it's (121:51 - 121:56)
faster for like 20 Pokemon because like (121:53 - 121:59)
in what Universe are you ever picking (121:56 - 122:01)
dondoo as the Pokemon you're going to (121:59 - 122:04)
walk with because you are slow there are (122:01 - 122:05)
also things about the syn machine that I (122:04 - 122:11)
just don't like um like why is amongus a (122:05 - 122:13)
Pokemon with a base speed 30 faster (122:11 - 122:16)
moving than dragapult like dragapults (122:13 - 122:18)
base speed is like (122:16 - 122:21)
142 Bas speed of the Pokemon has nothing (122:18 - 122:22)
to do with their Overworld (122:21 - 122:25)
speed for the most part it feels except (122:22 - 122:28)
if you're ver and then ver is just so (122:25 - 122:31)
fast which makes sense for ver like I (122:28 - 122:34)
need to do a race against miara and ver (122:31 - 122:36)
also if you are if you're H you say that (122:34 - 122:39)
flying Pokemon freef fall but ver and (122:36 - 122:40)
rev room don't if you go up to the (122:39 - 122:42)
highest point and you can you can just (122:40 - 122:46)
keep going you are hovering high high in (122:42 - 122:49)
the sky so like and then like I was (122:46 - 122:51)
using (122:49 - 122:54)
vua and then I was like oh man vua is so (122:51 - 122:55)
slow and then it was like well go in (122:54 - 122:59)
water I did it's Al slow in water and (122:55 - 123:01)
for anyone's like well it's based off (122:59 - 123:03)
the bare speed of their Pokemon and like (123:01 - 123:06)
blah BL we all played the original (123:03 - 123:09)
scarlet and violet don't Gaslight me (123:06 - 123:12)
vusa is everywhere and it's it's flying (123:09 - 123:15)
at you non-stop in the water like it's a (123:12 - 123:19)
fast Pokemon why is my valua moving (123:15 - 123:21)
slower than a charger buug like that's (123:19 - 123:23)
one of the Pokemon I would have expected (123:21 - 123:26)
to be fast yeah no valua is super slow (123:23 - 123:29)
like landeras is super slow and he's on (123:26 - 123:32)
a cloud he doesn't even have (123:29 - 123:36)
legs he's a force of nature like I think (123:32 - 123:38)
it's those things all added up with the (123:36 - 123:41)
fact that you can't jump you can't fly (123:38 - 123:44)
um you can't open your map which like (123:41 - 123:45)
the first time I was ver room and I was (123:44 - 123:47)
like zooming around I was like man this (123:45 - 123:48)
is awesome this is fun I'm having a (123:47 - 123:50)
great time I was like I don't know where (123:48 - 123:53)
I am let me open the map oh I I can't I (123:50 - 123:56)
I I I've like I want to again I spent (123:53 - 123:58)
two hours making clothes and then I (123:56 - 124:02)
spent 90 minutes in the the the Synchro (123:58 - 124:05)
machine I didn't know the map I didn't (124:02 - 124:07)
learn it I just zooming around I had no (124:05 - 124:09)
clue how to get back I mean you don't (124:07 - 124:10)
have the map cuz you're the Pokemon your (124:09 - 124:12)
player characters just standing there (124:10 - 124:13)
with their hands in front of their face (124:12 - 124:16)
with their eyes understand the (124:13 - 124:19)
logic get it it doesn't make it fun if (124:16 - 124:20)
you want the map I want to be able to (124:19 - 124:22)
see the BBQ's while I'm playing as a (124:20 - 124:24)
Pokémon because that was annoying having (124:22 - 124:27)
to memorize how many oh I didn't think (124:24 - 124:28)
about (124:27 - 124:31)
that well I mean you know obviously (124:28 - 124:35)
obviously I was making it for ComEd (124:31 - 124:37)
comedic effect obviously there are some (124:35 - 124:38)
issues with this my biggest issue with (124:37 - 124:39)
it is that you can accidentally knock (124:38 - 124:42)
out Shiny Pokemon which I I understand (124:39 - 124:44)
again like similar I understand the (124:42 - 124:46)
logic behind that right like the reason (124:44 - 124:47)
your Pokemon doesn't knock out a Shiny (124:46 - 124:49)
Pokemon is because it knows not to right (124:47 - 124:51)
and and you are the brains behind you've (124:49 - 124:53)
take which by the way there are some (124:51 - 124:55)
real ethical questions about taking over (124:53 - 124:58)
the body of a Pokemon right yep (124:55 - 125:00)
um but I feel like that's a whole other (124:58 - 125:04)
episode on its own um but it's not like (125:00 - 125:06)
the and especially if you're ver room or (125:04 - 125:08)
R room you are accidentally knocking (125:06 - 125:09)
Shiny Pokemon out before you've even (125:08 - 125:11)
realized it's shiny right because you (125:09 - 125:13)
don't have to attack as well if you so (125:11 - 125:16)
much as touchon you knock it out I have (125:13 - 125:17)
seen so many people accidentally knock (125:16 - 125:21)
out shiny Pokemon it's not yeah not fun (125:17 - 125:23)
okay but the counterargument to that is (125:21 - 125:27)
like oh just Synchro near A outbreak and (125:23 - 125:30)
then you can knock them out faster and (125:27 - 125:33)
I'm like yeah I guess but like when I (125:30 - 125:35)
was having the most (125:33 - 125:39)
fun with this feature it was when I was (125:35 - 125:42)
exploring the world and getting lost (125:39 - 125:44)
yeah like everyone who's like this is (125:42 - 125:46)
great it's probably because you're not (125:44 - 125:50)
using valua like no one is like man I (125:46 - 125:52)
can't wait to be Vala and move as fast (125:50 - 125:57)
as like sandpaper like that (125:52 - 125:57)
the your metaphors are on on on point (125:59 - 126:06)
today it felt like sandpaper in my brain (126:02 - 126:08)
of like what's happening um like it's (126:06 - 126:11)
like mascarada it's it's like uh eternus (126:08 - 126:14)
it's like ver it's like golden go these (126:11 - 126:16)
Pokemon that are just moving so fast so (126:14 - 126:18)
much faster than your character so they (126:16 - 126:21)
can do things faster but also like (126:18 - 126:25)
traversing the world at that speed is (126:21 - 126:28)
fun and also the frame rate is (126:25 - 126:29)
dramatically better but the reason is (126:28 - 126:31)
because Pokemon aren't spawning in so as (126:29 - 126:33)
long as Pokemon aren't spawning in your (126:31 - 126:35)
frame rate is good like if you go with (126:33 - 126:37)
ver room and go around the map you won't (126:35 - 126:39)
see Pokemon spawns because he's moving (126:37 - 126:42)
so fast but also your game runs like (126:39 - 126:44)
really smooth it's like a really (126:42 - 126:47)
interesting thing about (126:44 - 126:49)
how I don't know (126:47 - 126:52)
do spawn in just not if you're going as (126:49 - 126:54)
fast as you can in One Direction because (126:52 - 126:55)
you're going faster than the Pokemon can (126:54 - 126:58)
spawn right yes yes so if you're going (126:55 - 127:00)
full speed with Zer in a direction (126:58 - 127:02)
you're not like obviously if you're (127:00 - 127:03)
going normal speed with Z room things (127:02 - 127:05)
are going to spawn in but so what you're (127:03 - 127:07)
saying Steve is the best way to make (127:05 - 127:09)
these games run better is to have no (127:07 - 127:12)
Pokemon yeah yeah yeah get rid of all (127:09 - 127:16)
the Pokemon no Pokemon allowed uh so (127:12 - 127:19)
yeah like I I had an okay it was like (127:16 - 127:22)
the the fun I had was like how does this (127:19 - 127:23)
Pokemon move how does this one and a lot (127:22 - 127:26)
of them move the way you expect them to (127:23 - 127:29)
move and then there's like fun in like (127:26 - 127:31)
does this Pokemon swim does this Pokemon (127:29 - 127:34)
not swim and I can totally (127:31 - 127:36)
see like we had somebody in our chat and (127:34 - 127:38)
they were like oh my kids have only done (127:36 - 127:39)
the Synchro feature that's all they care (127:38 - 127:41)
about that's all they want to do and (127:39 - 127:41)
like right now they're playing (127:41 - 127:43)
hide-and-seek with their Pokemon and (127:41 - 127:45)
that's like that's awesome that's super (127:43 - 127:46)
cool you know what would make that (127:45 - 127:48)
hide-and-seek better if you could jump (127:46 - 127:51)
over a Ledge like like there's just like (127:48 - 127:53)
the little things of like I don't like (127:51 - 127:54)
it because of this but like there's so (127:53 - 127:57)
much potential there and then you go (127:54 - 128:01)
like did anyone at Game Freak Like play (127:57 - 128:03)
in this mode for an hour and be like hey (128:01 - 128:05)
maybe maybe our toad school should be (128:03 - 128:07)
able to like do a little (128:05 - 128:10)
hop it's one of those things that I hope (128:07 - 128:12)
they are saying is better off for game (128:10 - 128:14)
purposes but also is something they (128:12 - 128:16)
actually bring back (128:14 - 128:23)
again in GES a Pokemon you like is very (128:16 - 128:26)
novel yeah yeah it's one of the few (128:23 - 128:28)
things I've seen people asking who if (128:26 - 128:31)
they didn't buy the DLC they've been (128:28 - 128:32)
asking is this locked behind the DLC (128:31 - 128:34)
because this sounds (128:32 - 128:36)
interesting yeah no I it's crazy because (128:34 - 128:39)
I've only seen like we did our episode (128:36 - 128:40)
last week and I was like what is this (128:39 - 128:42)
feature for I did the did the standard (128:40 - 128:44)
question like who is this for and I was (128:42 - 128:46)
so surprised at the comments of being (128:44 - 128:47)
like people being like I'm so excited (128:46 - 128:48)
for this oh my gosh this looks so cool (128:47 - 128:50)
cool I can't believe like you're not (128:48 - 128:51)
excited for this I'm still not excited (128:50 - 128:55)
for it uh like like I I think I've spent (128:51 - 128:57)
more than enough time to be like 90 (128:55 - 128:59)
minutes straight in this mode is (128:57 - 129:01)
probably longer than most people will (128:59 - 129:04)
ever give it even if you're like even if (129:01 - 129:05)
you're like I'm just going to do it for (129:04 - 129:07)
outbreaks okay well then you're going to (129:05 - 129:09)
do it for about 60 seconds and then (129:07 - 129:11)
you're going to leave that mode because (129:09 - 129:13)
you can't be in that mode anymore to (129:11 - 129:16)
knock out a Pokemon like yeah you got (129:13 - 129:18)
the outbreak done twice as fast but it (129:16 - 129:20)
also only takes like five minutes to (129:18 - 129:21)
knock out 60 (129:20 - 129:24)
Pokemon and then once you do that you (129:21 - 129:27)
cannot be in that mode anymore (129:24 - 129:29)
because you're going to knock out your (129:27 - 129:33)
shiny and that's yeah not great like I (129:29 - 129:34)
was (129:33 - 129:37)
hoping that the mode would also (129:34 - 129:41)
include like Eevee training like that (129:37 - 129:43)
would be (129:41 - 129:46)
cool and it doesn't do that so the only (129:43 - 129:51)
thing that it really does is knock out M (129:46 - 129:54)
and get materials faster but then again (129:51 - 129:56)
you risk a shiny popping up and then (129:54 - 129:58)
your Pokemon just knocking it out right (129:56 - 129:59)
away because there's no way to control (129:58 - 130:03)
it and at that point it's like I don't (129:59 - 130:06)
think knocking out is that slow no and (130:03 - 130:08)
I'm also doing other things like taking (130:06 - 130:11)
photos (130:08 - 130:15)
or gliding or accessing my map so I (130:11 - 130:19)
would just rather not use it (130:15 - 130:21)
it definitely feels to me like there's a (130:19 - 130:23)
core of an idea here that could be (130:21 - 130:26)
really good if they put more stuff into (130:23 - 130:28)
it and whether that's you know we're (130:26 - 130:29)
going to get into that fun discussion (130:28 - 130:32)
again right is it the time is it the (130:29 - 130:34)
fact that people just made bad decisions (130:32 - 130:35)
you know these things we'll we'll never (130:34 - 130:38)
truly know but like I feel like there's (130:35 - 130:40)
we see this a lot in Pokemon where they (130:38 - 130:42)
do something and then in another game (130:40 - 130:43)
not probably not the next game but the (130:42 - 130:46)
one after that like the Remake if we get (130:43 - 130:47)
a remake next year it's not going to (130:46 - 130:49)
have this feature right but the game (130:47 - 130:51)
after that the Next Generation it will (130:49 - 130:53)
probably have something like it and it (130:51 - 130:55)
will see oh that's where they got this (130:53 - 130:58)
idea but they didn't they didn't go all (130:55 - 131:00)
the way with it right they went some of (130:58 - 131:03)
the way to try out an idea and see how (131:00 - 131:04)
people like it (131:03 - 131:07)
and the idea was to get this in the next (131:04 - 131:08)
game (131:07 - 131:11)
properly that's what I'm hoping I mean I (131:08 - 131:14)
can imagine I could imagine myself when (131:11 - 131:16)
I was this Pokemon loving little kid I (131:14 - 131:17)
would have spent so much time in this (131:16 - 131:20)
mode I pretended to be a Pokemon on the (131:17 - 131:21)
playground in elementary school I (131:20 - 131:23)
absolutely would have played as a (131:21 - 131:25)
Pokemon for as long as I possibly could (131:23 - 131:28)
in these games and I'm still enjoying it (131:25 - 131:31)
but I wish we could jump just a little (131:28 - 131:33)
bit I really wanted to use it for shiny (131:31 - 131:35)
hunting but as soon as I saw you knocked (131:33 - 131:38)
out a shiny I was like no no done I'm (131:35 - 131:40)
not risking that it's not even like what (131:38 - 131:42)
you said earlier where your Pokemon (131:40 - 131:44)
won't like you don't ever have to hit (131:42 - 131:48)
the attack yeah like and even if it was (131:44 - 131:50)
like the shiny pops up and you actually (131:48 - 131:52)
have to hit the attack I'd be like oh (131:50 - 131:53)
okay because that would give me time to (131:52 - 131:55)
be like depends on the Pokemon at that (131:53 - 131:58)
point right right but it's it's just (131:55 - 132:00)
like if you're close enough we're Auto (131:58 - 132:03)
attacking and if it spawns right next to (132:00 - 132:07)
you literally nothing you can do again I (132:03 - 132:10)
think like I think if you wanted to race (132:07 - 132:12)
your friends if you wanted to like play (132:10 - 132:15)
hide and seek I think that's there but (132:12 - 132:16)
like everything I'm complaining about (132:15 - 132:19)
isn't that like the concept is cool I'm (132:16 - 132:21)
complaining about like the jumping the (132:19 - 132:23)
flying the like the little things that (132:21 - 132:27)
would like you would think would just be (132:23 - 132:29)
there yeah (132:27 - 132:32)
um I don't know it (132:29 - 132:35)
just like maybe if I was in it for two (132:32 - 132:36)
hours they gave me a shirt I would (132:35 - 132:38)
definitely be more into it if they just (132:36 - 132:40)
gave me a free shirt at the end I plan (132:38 - 132:42)
to keep using it for (132:40 - 132:45)
BBQ's yeah speaking of BBQ's uh they're (132:42 - 132:48)
back uh I did a whole video about this (132:45 - 132:51)
of how or their their (132:48 - 132:54)
sorry the the everybody's favorite (132:51 - 132:57)
feature from another (132:54 - 133:00)
game speaking of BBQs they're back from (132:57 - 133:04)
America we have them every July it's (133:00 - 133:07)
great we could put hot dogs on the grill (133:04 - 133:09)
in this case you got to take a picture (133:07 - 133:13)
of a flying Pokemon uh a Pokemon in (133:09 - 133:15)
Flight not a Pokemon fighting which I (133:13 - 133:17)
thought it said for about two hours I (133:15 - 133:19)
was like how do you open your camera (133:17 - 133:21)
when they're fighting oh it say flight (133:19 - 133:22)
not (133:21 - 133:24)
fight (133:22 - 133:27)
um I think (133:24 - 133:29)
that this well look there's a lot of (133:27 - 133:31)
things in Pokemon where I go this should (133:29 - 133:32)
come back in a future game and then it (133:31 - 133:35)
never does like black and white had a (133:32 - 133:37)
metal system like black and white had (133:35 - 133:40)
its own Achievement System and it was (133:37 - 133:42)
fantastic and it's never come back sord (133:40 - 133:44)
Shield had it where your trainer card (133:42 - 133:45)
remembered how many Pokemon you caught (133:44 - 133:47)
how many shinies you caught what your (133:45 - 133:49)
score was that for whatever reason never (133:47 - 133:51)
came back (133:49 - 133:55)
um I think having little side quest in (133:51 - 133:57)
the sidebar to earn BP which is just (133:55 - 133:59)
another (133:57 - 134:01)
currency I think that's (133:59 - 134:04)
great I think it's great that you don't (134:01 - 134:05)
have to like walk somewhere to pick up (134:04 - 134:07)
new quests it's just you always have (134:05 - 134:09)
three you go through it I don't know (134:07 - 134:10)
what are your guys's thoughts about the (134:09 - 134:14)
BBQs I heard their (134:10 - 134:17)
back what the first b stands (134:14 - 134:19)
for (134:17 - 134:23)
I think I spent maybe four hours playing (134:19 - 134:25)
just just BBQ's last night just because (134:23 - 134:28)
it's a fun gameplay Loop for me I (134:25 - 134:30)
actually genuinely enjoy it yes they're (134:28 - 134:32)
repetitive but as I'm still exploring (134:30 - 134:35)
the map as I'm still getting to know the (134:32 - 134:38)
uh Dome I keep forgetting terrarium (134:35 - 134:40)
that's it as I'm still getting to know (134:38 - 134:44)
the terrarium which just a side point (134:40 - 134:47)
why is when was it named the terrarium (134:44 - 134:49)
because they only recently stable Terra (134:47 - 134:53)
in there just a thought (134:49 - 134:55)
but I think I played it for four hours (134:53 - 134:57)
last night and did not get tired of it (134:55 - 134:58)
the only reason I stopped was because I (134:57 - 135:00)
needed (134:58 - 135:00)
food yeah I I like them I think it's fun (135:00 - 135:05)
to have something that you're kind of (135:04 - 135:07)
almost accidentally doing as you're (135:05 - 135:10)
doing other things I I spent a good (135:07 - 135:12)
amount of time doing it myself and then (135:10 - 135:14)
as soon as I learned how many more you (135:12 - 135:16)
get doing it in a team I was like I am (135:14 - 135:18)
never going to focus on this on my own (135:16 - 135:20)
anymore right I will do some (135:18 - 135:21)
accidentally through just playing the (135:20 - 135:24)
game obviously but like if I'm focusing (135:21 - 135:27)
on these I am doing it in a team I I'm (135:24 - 135:30)
I'm maxing this out you know like it's (135:27 - 135:32)
it's wild the difference between that (135:30 - 135:35)
you know yeah and you don't even I mean (135:32 - 135:37)
some of them benefit from working (135:35 - 135:39)
together and from having communication (135:37 - 135:42)
but even just being in the same game and (135:39 - 135:44)
playing doing whatever you're working on (135:42 - 135:46)
in the same game means that you're going (135:44 - 135:50)
to be contributing to every be yeah the (135:46 - 135:51)
only thing that would like slow down a (135:50 - 135:53)
team stuff is like if people were (135:51 - 135:56)
focused on story stuff MH um but if (135:53 - 135:58)
everyone's even if everyone's like shiny (135:56 - 136:02)
hunting in their own way or um filling (135:58 - 136:04)
their Pokedex like you're filling your (136:02 - 136:07)
pokeddex I'm shiny hunting you're Mark (136:04 - 136:09)
hunting I don't know like you're still (136:07 - 136:13)
going to contribute because the group (136:09 - 136:16)
rewards are (136:13 - 136:19)
so uh overlapping (136:16 - 136:21)
like it's just so easy to be like like I (136:19 - 136:23)
like I had a BBQ for like two hours (136:21 - 136:25)
yesterday and it was like catch a (136:23 - 136:29)
fighting Pokemon but like I wasn't I was (136:25 - 136:31)
doing other things like I wasn't near (136:29 - 136:33)
any fighting Pokemon but if I was in a (136:31 - 136:34)
group setting that would have been done (136:33 - 136:36)
almost like instantly cuz somebody would (136:34 - 136:38)
have caught a fighting Pokemon at that (136:36 - 136:39)
point like somebody would have would (136:38 - 136:42)
have done it yeah so this is like the (136:39 - 136:45)
good and the bad the good is (136:42 - 136:49)
like they made Co-op or like the reason (136:45 - 136:52)
to join somebody else's world exciting (136:49 - 136:55)
and beneficial it like feels rewarding (136:52 - 136:57)
the bad (136:55 - 137:01)
is to get the better or get faster (136:57 - 137:02)
rewards you have to join somebody's (137:01 - 137:05)
reward like Al said there's not like (137:02 - 137:08)
there's just a day and night difference (137:05 - 137:11)
in being solo versus being with somebody (137:08 - 137:14)
else I mean yes (137:11 - 137:18)
but it doesn't really matter right like (137:14 - 137:21)
it's not like you have to do the BBQs to (137:18 - 137:23)
well I mean you have to have a certain (137:21 - 137:25)
amount of BP to finish the story but (137:23 - 137:26)
it's really small amount like you can (137:25 - 137:29)
spend yourself half an hour on your own (137:26 - 137:31)
and you can get all the BP you need for (137:29 - 137:33)
the rest of the story right like it's (137:31 - 137:35)
not if if you want to like get all of (137:33 - 137:37)
the Pokemon in all the biomes and you (137:35 - 137:40)
want to like get all of the upgrades in (137:37 - 137:42)
the room and you want to do all yeah you (137:40 - 137:44)
you you will need to to do that unless (137:42 - 137:46)
you're going to spend hours and hours (137:44 - 137:48)
and hours doing it yourself but this is (137:46 - 137:49)
like this is the thing is like people (137:48 - 137:52)
are like ah the teal mask was so (137:49 - 137:55)
short yeah I mean I I don't disagree (137:52 - 137:57)
with those people but also like if you (137:55 - 138:01)
grind out all the BP in like two hours (137:57 - 138:03)
which you you actually could with a (138:01 - 138:05)
group of people and you unlock all the (138:03 - 138:06)
biomes and you unlock all the rooms and (138:05 - 138:08)
you unlock all the throwing Styles and (138:06 - 138:09)
you unlock all the (138:08 - 138:12)
speakers you're you're you're done you (138:09 - 138:14)
did it like that's it like you've (138:12 - 138:18)
unlocked everything so like (138:14 - 138:21)
it's this weird like balance of like how (138:18 - 138:25)
do I minmax this but also (138:21 - 138:29)
like they like once you spend the 12,000 (138:25 - 138:31)
to unlock all the biomes which is (138:29 - 138:33)
probably the thing that people want the (138:31 - 138:35)
most and legitimately if you are playing (138:33 - 138:37)
with other people you can get 12,000 an (138:35 - 138:39)
hour if you're doing that solo it would (138:37 - 138:40)
probably take (138:39 - 138:43)
you maybe (138:40 - 138:46)
like like four times longer minus that (138:43 - 138:47)
it would probably take you like six or (138:46 - 138:49)
eight hours if you were doing that solo (138:47 - 138:52)
which is like really repetitive (138:49 - 138:55)
but I I think a person not listening to (138:52 - 138:57)
this podcast is probably like not that (138:55 - 138:59)
hardcore they're like oh cool I unlock (138:57 - 139:02)
this biome today I'll unlock another (138:59 - 139:04)
biome tomorrow I'll unlock another biome (139:02 - 139:07)
on Sunday right it's really not that big (139:04 - 139:08)
of a deal it's almost like the Animal (139:07 - 139:10)
Crossing problem of like well I want to (139:08 - 139:13)
build Three Bridges today it was like (139:10 - 139:14)
let's slow down there's not a lot to do (139:13 - 139:17)
in animal crossing here like the whole (139:14 - 139:18)
thing is kind of like milking a (139:17 - 139:21)
day-to-day kind of thing like it's it's (139:18 - 139:23)
easy to complain that like you don't (139:21 - 139:26)
have enough BP right now right in this (139:23 - 139:28)
instance but it's also easy in like four (139:26 - 139:31)
days to be like well I I did everything (139:28 - 139:33)
like yeah you you you hardcore grind (139:31 - 139:35)
like it's like this again I'm not saying (139:33 - 139:37)
one person is right or one person is (139:35 - 139:39)
wrong but there is like this balance of (139:37 - 139:41)
like it's not that big of a deal but (139:39 - 139:43)
also like if you want it to be easier (139:41 - 139:46)
this feature like Co-op is here that's (139:43 - 139:48)
what I like about it right is like it's (139:46 - 139:51)
it's not you don't need to do (139:48 - 139:54)
this but you can if you really care (139:51 - 139:57)
about it and so like I will do that (139:54 - 140:00)
because it's just wildly quicker and I (139:57 - 140:02)
can do that and it doesn't mean I'm then (140:00 - 140:03)
going to immediately go and unlock (140:02 - 140:05)
everything straight away but it does (140:03 - 140:07)
mean that I have that ability if I want (140:05 - 140:12)
to um yeah this is one of my sorry no no (140:07 - 140:14)
this is one of my favorite ways they can (140:12 - 140:17)
inter Implement there we go Implement (140:14 - 140:19)
some sort of coop something where (140:17 - 140:22)
someone can do what they're trying to do (140:19 - 140:24)
on their own just slower and with a (140:22 - 140:26)
whole lot more effort but when you're (140:24 - 140:28)
doing it in Co-op it goes a whole lot (140:26 - 140:30)
faster this is some of the complaints (140:28 - 140:32)
that people have with say raid battles (140:30 - 140:34)
in Pokemon go where there are raids you (140:32 - 140:36)
just can't solo that you absolutely need (140:34 - 140:38)
other people for but in this case you (140:36 - 140:40)
can do all of this on your own it just (140:38 - 140:41)
takes (140:40 - 140:45)
time yeah so like the main complaint is (140:41 - 140:46)
like I don't have friends I can't do (140:45 - 140:50)
this or why did they put this feature (140:46 - 140:52)
behind Co like Co-op I the feature is (140:50 - 140:55)
not behind Co-op you can do it yourself (140:52 - 140:58)
again like you could easily unlock the (140:55 - 141:01)
bi like one biome every day for four (140:58 - 141:03)
days and it would it realistically it (141:01 - 141:04)
would probably take you like an hour a (141:03 - 141:06)
day every day to do that imagine playing (141:04 - 141:09)
a video game that you purchased like (141:06 - 141:13)
crazy right um it does like there need (141:09 - 141:14)
there there always needs to be this is (141:13 - 141:16)
the problem I antic is struggling with (141:14 - 141:19)
there needs to be benefits playing with (141:16 - 141:22)
people versus like yes it might be a (141:19 - 141:24)
little bit harder or a little bit slower (141:22 - 141:26)
by yourself but like if you want us to (141:24 - 141:28)
go out and play with people Niantic you (141:26 - 141:30)
need to give us something to do it if (141:28 - 141:33)
that's your envisioning of this game (141:30 - 141:36)
like I did Co-op twice (141:33 - 141:39)
before the Indigo disc and the first (141:36 - 141:41)
time was like let's try to shiny hunt (141:39 - 141:42)
and it was like oh this is okay like (141:41 - 141:44)
we're not getting as many spawns it's (141:42 - 141:46)
like super laggy like and then when I (141:44 - 141:48)
did it again the second time I realized (141:46 - 141:51)
oh if you came over we made a sandwich (141:48 - 141:53)
together which is whatever fun fine we (141:51 - 141:55)
save ingredients and then you leave we (141:53 - 141:57)
actually just both have better (141:55 - 141:59)
experiences once you (141:57 - 142:02)
leave like shockingly enough the co-op (141:59 - 142:04)
does work like that's the surprising (142:02 - 142:06)
part about this that is like the frame (142:04 - 142:08)
rate aside like game freak made Co-op (142:06 - 142:10)
work which is pretty impressive uh I (142:08 - 142:12)
didn't think they would be able to do it (142:10 - 142:14)
um (142:12 - 142:17)
but when people join in the Indigo disc (142:14 - 142:19)
yes it's like more frame rate it's a (142:17 - 142:21)
little more chunky but it's not like (142:19 - 142:23)
it's that much better when people aren't (142:21 - 142:25)
there you do get like less spawns (142:23 - 142:26)
especially if the person's like standing (142:25 - 142:29)
next to you but if everyone joins and (142:26 - 142:31)
then just goes to a separate biome it's (142:29 - 142:34)
like actually a fun fantastic experience (142:31 - 142:37)
like it's really cool yeah um and it's (142:34 - 142:38)
like it does feel like I remember those (142:37 - 142:41)
like fa like those like fan-made (142:38 - 142:43)
MMOs where it was like we put all the (142:41 - 142:46)
regions in the my nerd voice again we (142:43 - 142:47)
put all the regions in the game and you (142:46 - 142:50)
can like shiny hunt together and like (142:47 - 142:51)
when you watch it it's just like five (142:50 - 142:53)
people in the grass running like back (142:51 - 142:55)
and forth and it's like yeah I mean I (142:53 - 142:56)
guess you're together but like you're (142:55 - 143:00)
not really doing anything together like (142:56 - 143:02)
this actually feels like we're in a (143:00 - 143:04)
world together and like I love the ditto (143:02 - 143:06)
thing I think the ditto thing is so fun (143:04 - 143:09)
to like find the Dittos I like the (143:06 - 143:11)
everyone get together to take a picture (143:09 - 143:13)
I think that's like really charming and (143:11 - 143:14)
fun even though it's like maybe one of (143:13 - 143:16)
the more annoying ones but it's like (143:14 - 143:18)
there's still like a charm to of like (143:16 - 143:20)
everyone get their glasses for this (143:18 - 143:22)
picture I think it's fun because it like (143:20 - 143:23)
what they're doing is they're (143:22 - 143:25)
incentivizing you to split up and then (143:23 - 143:27)
incentivizing you to come back together (143:25 - 143:29)
in a couple of different ways as well (143:27 - 143:30)
right because it it makes you know it's (143:29 - 143:32)
not just like oh yeah if you're together (143:30 - 143:34)
it's lagier right that is a thing to (143:32 - 143:35)
bear in mind but also if you're all (143:34 - 143:38)
together you know if someone needs to be (143:35 - 143:39)
in the polar region to take a picture (143:38 - 143:41)
because it said take a picture of a (143:39 - 143:43)
Pokemon in the polar region you're not (143:41 - 143:45)
there you need to be there right so it (143:43 - 143:47)
like it's it incentivizes you to do do (143:45 - 143:49)
different things and then it's like oh (143:47 - 143:51)
hey now's the time to meet up either (143:49 - 143:53)
through taking a picture or you all go (143:51 - 143:54)
to this one biome because you're looking (143:53 - 143:56)
for the ditto ones and then you're (143:54 - 143:59)
spread out but in a small a smaller area (143:56 - 144:01)
like I really like I think it's a good (143:59 - 144:02)
balance of different things they're (144:01 - 144:05)
doing there yeah and having the BBQ's (144:02 - 144:07)
all there and having the ability to sort (144:05 - 144:09)
of see when people are checking them off (144:07 - 144:11)
see when people are achieving them and (144:09 - 144:13)
have that constantly going on screen (144:11 - 144:14)
knowing that you're playing with other (144:13 - 144:17)
people is a whole lot more fun it's also (144:14 - 144:19)
amazing for ADHD people right because (144:17 - 144:20)
it's just the constantly doing stuff (144:19 - 144:23)
there's always noises and and colors and (144:20 - 144:26)
I love it it's (144:23 - 144:29)
fantastic I our Discord grew over a (144:26 - 144:31)
thousand people in 24 hours because of (144:29 - 144:33)
the little YouTube video I put out and I (144:31 - 144:34)
said hey if you need help like I (144:33 - 144:36)
literally made a F minute video of like (144:34 - 144:37)
hey I'm not going to draw this out I'm (144:36 - 144:38)
not going to draw this video out I'm not (144:37 - 144:40)
going to clickbait you if you want BP (144:38 - 144:42)
fast you got to join with people if (144:40 - 144:43)
you're looking to play with people our (144:42 - 144:45)
discord's really great like I don't (144:43 - 144:47)
really do a lot in my own Discord I have (144:45 - 144:49)
like a great moderation team over here (144:47 - 144:51)
there also like we don't have to (144:49 - 144:53)
moderate anything in slack because for (144:51 - 144:54)
whatever reason everyone's very well (144:53 - 144:56)
behaved and like my they never they (144:54 - 144:58)
never any drama in slack there's always (144:56 - 145:00)
some drama in Discord because you know I (144:58 - 145:02)
think I think Discord tends to cater to (145:00 - 145:04)
a younger audience versus it's also much (145:02 - 145:07)
much bigger yeah Discord yeah slack is (145:04 - 145:09)
more of like a corporate thing well when (145:07 - 145:12)
I made the slack initially Discord was (145:09 - 145:15)
not a thing it just didn't exist back (145:12 - 145:17)
then so um anyways have two different (145:15 - 145:19)
communities they're both great for (145:17 - 145:21)
different reasons but I woke up and I (145:19 - 145:23)
was like I didn't expect this video to (145:21 - 145:24)
blow up it was just like a f minute (145:23 - 145:28)
video of like here's a couple tricks do (145:24 - 145:29)
this (145:28 - 145:32)
and it's great like it's so like (145:29 - 145:33)
everyone's saying they're having a great (145:32 - 145:36)
time with it like universally I think (145:33 - 145:38)
the the complaint you see is like I (145:36 - 145:40)
don't have friends or I don't have (145:38 - 145:42)
Nintendo online or I don't want to do (145:40 - 145:44)
this but I think like those complaints (145:42 - 145:46)
aside like I understand those (145:44 - 145:48)
complaints people aren't complaining (145:46 - 145:50)
about like the co-op they're like it's (145:48 - 145:52)
so great to get in here these quests are (145:50 - 145:54)
fun I think Al hit it out the park like (145:52 - 145:55)
you all go off in your separate way but (145:54 - 145:57)
they give you quests to come back (145:55 - 146:00)
together um which is like really smart (145:57 - 146:04)
um and like one of the few things that (146:00 - 146:05)
game freak has done right this (146:04 - 146:08)
generation but like it's it's so good to (146:05 - 146:09)
like get a quest of like hatch an egg (146:08 - 146:11)
like I don't want to hatch an egg I (146:09 - 146:13)
don't like hatching eggs in this game so (146:11 - 146:14)
for somebody to be like I'll hatch the (146:13 - 146:16)
egg and then like I'll find a raid like (146:14 - 146:17)
I'll do a raid (146:16 - 146:20)
and then like you guys want to join cool (146:17 - 146:21)
if you guys don't want to join that's (146:20 - 146:24)
also cool keep doing your thing like I (146:21 - 146:26)
don't need all four of you here to knock (146:24 - 146:28)
out like a three star kemy like I can do (146:26 - 146:29)
it myself you'll still get the points (146:28 - 146:31)
like go keep doing but if you want to (146:29 - 146:34)
come in that's cool too like there's (146:31 - 146:36)
just so many things about this where (146:34 - 146:39)
like I when I think about raid battles (146:36 - 146:43)
in sword and shield I think to myself I (146:39 - 146:45)
cannot EV Envision a game without raid (146:43 - 146:47)
battles going forward I think four (146:45 - 146:49)
people four (146:47 - 146:52)
person PVE (146:49 - 146:57)
Co-op is a feature that needs to stay in (146:52 - 147:02)
Pokemon and with this this is like this (146:57 - 147:05)
Co-op feature of go off your own thing (147:02 - 147:07)
come back (147:05 - 147:10)
together is an like the first thing I (147:07 - 147:12)
think in generation 9 where I'm like (147:10 - 147:14)
this needs cuz like raids in generation (147:12 - 147:16)
9 are not new well they're a new style (147:14 - 147:18)
but still the concept is the same but I (147:16 - 147:20)
do think this is the thing that needs to (147:18 - 147:22)
stay like breeding needs to stay (147:20 - 147:24)
competitive needs to stay trading needs (147:22 - 147:27)
to stay raids now need to stay but I (147:24 - 147:30)
think this whatever this is needs to (147:27 - 147:32)
stay (147:30 - 147:36)
yeah yeah yeah I liked (147:32 - 147:38)
sorry I liked Co-op before and I like it (147:36 - 147:39)
even more (147:38 - 147:42)
now I didn't like Coop before now I do (147:39 - 147:43)
like (147:42 - 147:46)
it but I don't I don't think this is (147:43 - 147:49)
like new or unique to this series no um (147:46 - 147:51)
and I I did see some people say this (147:49 - 147:54)
like I I don't I don't consider Pokemon (147:51 - 147:57)
ever to be a multiplayer game I consider (147:54 - 147:59)
it to be a community game and maybe this (147:57 - 148:02)
is just me making up words but (147:59 - 148:05)
like I think there is even going back to (148:02 - 148:07)
red and blue like yes you can play that (148:05 - 148:09)
whole game solo but still the concept of (148:07 - 148:12)
that was to purchase a $15 Link cable or (148:09 - 148:13)
somebody to purchase that and then to (148:12 - 148:16)
trade those Pokemon like in red and blue (148:13 - 148:19)
you cannot get all the starter Pokemon (148:16 - 148:21)
like somebody like unfortunately in that (148:19 - 148:23)
game you would have to have friend who (148:21 - 148:25)
wanted to restart their game and then (148:23 - 148:26)
trade you a bubbl store and then restart (148:25 - 148:27)
their game again and trade you a (148:26 - 148:28)
squirrel and then restart their game (148:27 - 148:31)
again and trade you the a what was the (148:28 - 148:33)
last Charmander and then do it three (148:31 - 148:35)
more times because then they want you to (148:33 - 148:39)
trade those back to you right like in (148:35 - 148:43)
Ultra Sun Ultra Moon you could get two (148:39 - 148:45)
basilon and then the other version got (148:43 - 148:47)
two staka takas the whole whole point of (148:45 - 148:50)
that was to trade your extra for (148:47 - 148:52)
somebody else's extra like even going (148:50 - 148:56)
back to X and Y X and Y if you stayed (148:52 - 149:00)
online and you had the P PSS PPS (148:56 - 149:05)
PSS like you could ow power people and (149:00 - 149:07)
that was a better experience like yes (149:05 - 149:09)
you could have played all of X and Y (149:07 - 149:11)
offline but like if I was trying to (149:09 - 149:14)
catch xerus or or zygard I could be like (149:11 - 149:16)
hey Al can you I know you're online can (149:14 - 149:19)
you send me C power o power over here Mr (149:16 - 149:20)
Bond and send it right on over and Al (149:19 - 149:22)
could do that and my catching experience (149:20 - 149:25)
is better like they every Pokemon game (149:22 - 149:28)
has had some sort of Beyond you know (149:25 - 149:30)
trading and battling some sort of (149:28 - 149:33)
community come together kind of features (149:30 - 149:34)
and obviously like Indigo disc has like (149:33 - 149:37)
Vulpix and and alolan sandrew are like (149:34 - 149:42)
separate and um karant and morco are (149:37 - 149:44)
separate in the teal mask right like (149:42 - 149:45)
like version exclusives have always (149:44 - 149:47)
existed but (149:45 - 149:50)
they have always done (149:47 - 149:52)
like sitting on a couch next to each (149:50 - 149:53)
other (149:52 - 149:57)
or um now with connecting online and (149:53 - 149:59)
like playing together like this is this (149:57 - 150:02)
is not unique I think it's just like I (149:59 - 150:04)
want BP fast but I don't like playing (150:02 - 150:06)
online like I think those two are (150:04 - 150:09)
clashing and it's like I get it I I (150:06 - 150:10)
totally get it if you don't have (150:09 - 150:11)
Nintendo online or if you don't have (150:10 - 150:14)
anyone to play with but I mean just like (150:11 - 150:16)
with generation one you can always just (150:14 - 150:18)
buy another one and do it yourself with (150:16 - 150:20)
yourself right I love I would I would (150:18 - 150:22)
love to see the first person who has (150:20 - 150:27)
like four switches all laid out and yeah (150:22 - 150:30)
trying to do the pbq is on all of them (150:27 - 150:32)
all at the same time I want to see that (150:30 - 150:33)
please someone do it even if you had (150:32 - 150:35)
four switches it would still go faster (150:33 - 150:37)
for you if you're only playing one just (150:35 - 150:39)
because you're seeing 12 quests instead (150:37 - 150:40)
of three quests that's that's a good (150:39 - 150:43)
yeah that's very true so ultimately it (150:40 - 150:45)
is like red and blue in that instance of (150:43 - 150:46)
like having two game boys buying your (150:45 - 150:49)
link cable it's just exactly you know (150:46 - 150:51)
and the thing is right like if you don't (150:49 - 150:54)
have Nintendo online sure fine yeah okay (150:51 - 150:57)
for you you can go to my nintendo.com (150:54 - 150:59)
and then like use like 10 Platinum (150:57 - 151:02)
points to get like a free trial yeah (150:59 - 151:03)
there's not huge amount we can do for (151:02 - 151:06)
you that if you really care about it you (151:03 - 151:09)
might have to find some people in real (151:06 - 151:11)
life and I know that that's not a fun (151:09 - 151:13)
thing for some of us right I get that (151:11 - 151:16)
but there probably is something near you (151:13 - 151:20)
right there prob is a Pokémon tournament (151:16 - 151:22)
group or a trading group or they (151:20 - 151:24)
probably exist I know there's one near (151:22 - 151:26)
me I never go to it because I don't well (151:24 - 151:28)
one don't have the time and two I don't (151:26 - 151:30)
like people but there's probably (151:28 - 151:32)
something near you if you really care (151:30 - 151:35)
about it yeah and (151:32 - 151:39)
um if you are somebody who struggles (151:35 - 151:42)
with social anxiety or communicating (151:39 - 151:44)
with other people there's very little (151:42 - 151:46)
Communication in once you do connect to (151:44 - 151:48)
the co-op and also like I said in my (151:46 - 151:50)
like little five- minute video you (151:48 - 151:51)
really only have to do this for an hour (151:50 - 151:54)
if your if your like goal is just to get (151:51 - 151:56)
as many as much BP as possible just to (151:54 - 151:58)
unlock stuff like everything else in the (151:56 - 152:01)
game is relatively cheap like it's just (151:58 - 152:03)
like the biomes and (152:01 - 152:07)
like uh like the camera feature the (152:03 - 152:08)
camera features that like add like (152:07 - 152:10)
filters or marks or stuff the only one (152:08 - 152:11)
you really want as marks like the (152:10 - 152:14)
filters don't matter either but like you (152:11 - 152:17)
can get 10,000 BP in an hour playing (152:14 - 152:19)
with four people and then you literally (152:17 - 152:20)
literally never really have to do it (152:19 - 152:23)
again because the rest of the BP is that (152:20 - 152:25)
just that Loop of like knocking out (152:23 - 152:27)
Pokemon doing it coming back and then (152:25 - 152:30)
you can get 150 BP solo by yourself very (152:27 - 152:32)
easy if you want to keep running the (152:30 - 152:35)
American five star meal over and over (152:32 - 152:39)
again um yeah so but I get it like I (152:35 - 152:41)
totally get somebody it's it's like the (152:39 - 152:43)
raid thing we've talked about literally (152:41 - 152:45)
for the last year of like people don't (152:43 - 152:46)
want to join raids not because because (152:45 - 152:48)
they don't have Nintendo online or not (152:46 - 152:49)
because they don't like social features (152:48 - 152:50)
it's that people don't want to join (152:49 - 152:51)
raids because they've had a bad (152:50 - 152:53)
experience they don't want to be the (152:51 - 152:55)
person to join a raid and be like we (152:53 - 152:57)
lost this raid because of Hannah I can't (152:55 - 152:59)
believe Hannah brought this Meara to a (152:57 - 153:02)
tyan raid and Hannah it's not even level (152:59 - 153:04)
100 and then Hannah's like ah I'm the (153:02 - 153:05)
person that like lost the raid I don't (153:04 - 153:06)
want to do it again like pick somebody (153:05 - 153:08)
else like that is a real thing that (153:06 - 153:10)
exists and then you know it turns people (153:08 - 153:12)
off and it's it's probably the same here (153:10 - 153:14)
with Co-op like oh I went into like a (153:12 - 153:16)
streamer stream and I was like hey does (153:14 - 153:17)
anyone have it in the streamer like was (153:16 - 153:19)
like no we don't do it here or like no I (153:17 - 153:21)
only play with my friends like I totally (153:19 - 153:24)
get that and that's why like with you (153:21 - 153:25)
know when people come in and they're (153:24 - 153:27)
like can I post a code it's like like (153:25 - 153:29)
you've already passed the first test (153:27 - 153:31)
right like you've already passed the (153:29 - 153:33)
like can I like you're asking a question (153:31 - 153:35)
instead of just like posting a code like (153:33 - 153:36)
this is the weird thing about Pokemon my (153:35 - 153:38)
my side rant the weird thing is when I (153:36 - 153:40)
stream Pokemon go people come into my (153:38 - 153:42)
stream they don't say hi they don't say (153:40 - 153:44)
anything they just start spamming their (153:42 - 153:47)
friend code that's it no text here's (153:44 - 153:49)
just 12 digits it's so weird in the Poke (153:47 - 153:51)
maybe because Pokemon go is free I think (153:49 - 153:56)
that's why so you get like um but like (153:51 - 153:57)
if you came into my stream and you're (153:56 - 153:59)
like hey I'm looking for people for BBQs (153:57 - 154:00)
which has happened a lot in the last (153:59 - 154:02)
three days like you have already (154:00 - 154:05)
provided so much more social interaction (154:02 - 154:07)
than the go players that are just like I (154:05 - 154:08)
get why you're spamming your code (154:07 - 154:10)
because you don't have friends because (154:08 - 154:14)
you're not using words talk maybe say (154:10 - 154:18)
hello first I promise you it will go a (154:14 - 154:20)
longer I'm also I suspect somebody will (154:18 - 154:22)
be building an app for it as well right (154:20 - 154:24)
like we have the apps for Pokémon go (154:22 - 154:27)
that allow you to connect to people you (154:24 - 154:30)
get their friends codes you add them and (154:27 - 154:32)
then you get invited to a raid and you (154:30 - 154:33)
never have to talk to anyone and then (154:32 - 154:35)
you can delete them afterwards you never (154:33 - 154:38)
like there's literally zero effort into (154:35 - 154:40)
that I suspect we'll have the same for (154:38 - 154:42)
this as well like hey join this queue (154:40 - 154:43)
and you'll be given a code and you can (154:42 - 154:46)
go and do that but I think the the other (154:43 - 154:47)
like you were talking about like oh yeah (154:46 - 154:48)
there's the negatives in raids of you (154:47 - 154:52)
can Muck it up you can't muck this up (154:48 - 154:54)
you really can't as you say even if you (154:52 - 154:56)
even if you do nothing you are still (154:54 - 154:58)
advantaging every everyone because (154:56 - 155:00)
you're giving them more things to (154:58 - 155:02)
complete at the same time right (155:00 - 155:04)
literally there's no NE Like You could (155:02 - 155:06)
argue that oh well they took a spot the (155:04 - 155:07)
spot that someone else could have been (155:06 - 155:09)
in and doing more but then you're just (155:07 - 155:12)
like you're Min maxing at that point (155:09 - 155:15)
just spend more time doing it it's fine (155:12 - 155:17)
it's also not like animal CR Al can't (155:15 - 155:20)
come over and like stomp stomp on my (155:17 - 155:22)
like flowers like there there's nothing (155:20 - 155:24)
that Al can do in my world to like ruin (155:22 - 155:27)
my experience I suppose that like Al (155:24 - 155:30)
destroy your ecosystem like Crouch (155:27 - 155:32)
behind me and like hide in the bush and (155:30 - 155:34)
then when like a shiny milser comes up (155:32 - 155:36)
he's like the one that like Sprints to (155:34 - 155:40)
it for I maybe that could be it but but (155:36 - 155:42)
like I don't think that situation is (155:40 - 155:45)
happening that's so much effort as (155:42 - 155:47)
well (155:45 - 155:49)
anyways if you're if you're listening to (155:47 - 155:51)
this part you need people to play with (155:49 - 155:53)
uh our Discord is free our slack is (155:51 - 155:55)
behind the patreon stuff probably for (155:53 - 155:59)
the best uh but but our you can also (155:55 - 156:01)
come to stream when I'm live on Twitch (155:59 - 156:02)
uh I don't know Hannah are you also (156:01 - 156:06)
doing BBQs on your Twitch I haven't yet (156:02 - 156:09)
but I was very story focused until the (156:06 - 156:11)
very last stream I've done this week I (156:09 - 156:13)
plan to do a couple BBQ parties I think (156:11 - 156:14)
okay there you go so Dan Hannah's (156:13 - 156:18)
streaming I'm streaming um our Discord (156:14 - 156:20)
has really we have threaded messages for (156:18 - 156:22)
BBQ so it's not like in general where (156:20 - 156:24)
it's like clogging up everything or it's (156:22 - 156:26)
confusing you can talk you cannot talk (156:24 - 156:27)
we're I'm making it as easy as possible (156:26 - 156:30)
for BBQs because like again with the (156:27 - 156:35)
raid situation like I get it I I totally (156:30 - 156:36)
get having a bad raid experience and (156:35 - 156:38)
like being tainted of like I don't want (156:36 - 156:40)
to do this anymore so like between the (156:38 - 156:43)
communities here that I've attempted to (156:40 - 156:45)
build trying to make it as easy and (156:43 - 156:50)
friendly and the possible for that (156:45 - 156:54)
um uh yeah so I I think I think the BBQ (156:50 - 156:56)
stuff is good and I think the co-op (156:54 - 156:59)
stuff is good uh none of that just none (156:56 - 157:01)
of that has to do with the frame rate is (156:59 - 157:04)
still bad um but we we've run really (157:01 - 157:05)
long there's one more thing I want to (157:04 - 157:07)
talk about although there's probably a (157:05 - 157:11)
bunch on our list that we missed uh (157:07 - 157:13)
will'll end on a bad note legendary (157:11 - 157:15)
Pokemon there's 25 of them that have (157:13 - 157:18)
come back (157:15 - 157:18)
but are I cannot tell you the just this (157:18 - 157:27)
exhausted sigh that I made when I first (157:23 - 157:29)
saw that they were shiny locked and I (157:27 - 157:33)
went oh I just and the someone I (157:29 - 157:35)
actually laughed out loud I actually (157:33 - 157:37)
loled in real life when I found that out (157:35 - 157:40)
I don't I cackled that that was a thing (157:37 - 157:42)
that happened cuz it was funny cuz the (157:40 - 157:43)
the week before people were like Steve (157:42 - 157:44)
you think the things are going to be (157:43 - 157:46)
shiny locked and I was like why would (157:44 - 157:49)
they do that why do you think that (157:46 - 157:51)
there's literally a twitch stream clip (157:49 - 157:53)
of you doing it and it's like just amaz (157:51 - 157:56)
you're just so dismissive of the idea (157:53 - 157:57)
and I would be too it's like why would (157:56 - 157:58)
they suddenly decide they're going to (157:57 - 158:00)
shiny lock these Pokemon that you've (157:58 - 158:03)
been able to shine shiny hunt for 10 (158:00 - 158:08)
games now oh Rayquaza has been shiny (158:03 - 158:11)
like you can turn Rayquaza for like 20 (158:08 - 158:14)
some years why would they lock him they (158:11 - 158:15)
really want you to go back and do (158:14 - 158:19)
Dynamax Adventure that's what it (158:15 - 158:19)
is (158:19 - 158:25)
um sorry I I have thoughts Hannah when (158:21 - 158:27)
you heard the news hit me hit me with (158:25 - 158:30)
your I had the opposite kind of thing (158:27 - 158:32)
that you did I had been saying for the (158:30 - 158:35)
few days before the DLC came out that I (158:32 - 158:36)
I'm holding my breath I'm not going to (158:35 - 158:38)
be certain that they are not shiny (158:36 - 158:39)
locked until I see that they are not (158:38 - 158:43)
shiny locked and that they were they are (158:39 - 158:46)
shiny locked for me it is what is it is (158:43 - 158:49)
I'm not a huge shiny Hunter but I can (158:46 - 158:50)
see a lot of people being really (158:49 - 158:52)
disappointed in (158:50 - 158:55)
it yeah uh here here's my hot (158:52 - 158:57)
take shiny loocks have been around since (158:55 - 159:00)
Gen 5 the first Pokemon that they like (158:57 - 159:01)
ultimately shiny locked that people (159:00 - 159:04)
noticed were raram and zeram obviously (159:01 - 159:06)
you you have to catch them before the (159:04 - 159:09)
finals of you knowa spoiler you got to (159:06 - 159:11)
catch raram and zeram and black and (159:09 - 159:13)
white they're on the (159:11 - 159:17)
cover um and and I don't know if I (159:13 - 159:19)
misremembering or if I read an article (159:17 - 159:20)
or if I talked to like somebody from (159:19 - 159:22)
Buble pedia or sby I don't think it was (159:20 - 159:24)
Joe I I would remember my conversation (159:22 - 159:27)
with Joe um that there was like an (159:24 - 159:28)
interview saying that the reason they (159:27 - 159:30)
shiny locked those Pokemon is because (159:28 - 159:32)
they were so proud of the story and they (159:30 - 159:34)
didn't want people to get there and then (159:32 - 159:36)
reset over and over and then never (159:34 - 159:38)
finish the story I think that was the (159:36 - 159:39)
initial statement that they put out (159:38 - 159:41)
somewhere whether it was like translated (159:39 - 159:43)
in Japanese or maybe I just dreamed it (159:41 - 159:45)
up that sounds pretty accurate Alice (159:43 - 159:47)
shaking his head I so I think I'm not (159:45 - 159:49)
remembering no I was I was I was kind of (159:47 - 159:53)
like yeah I I agreeing with you I think (159:49 - 159:54)
I'm pretty sure it was like we're proud (159:53 - 159:55)
of the story we didn't want people to (159:54 - 159:57)
get like stuck here we wanted people to (159:55 - 159:59)
see the ending of the game now if you (159:57 - 160:01)
take that same logic and you apply that (159:59 - 160:03)
to like starters being shiny locked it (160:01 - 160:05)
makes sense like we want you like how (160:03 - 160:07)
many people do you know are still at (160:05 - 160:08)
briefcase simulator in Diamond and Pearl (160:07 - 160:10)
I actually know like five people who (160:08 - 160:11)
actually bought that game and never (160:10 - 160:12)
played it and they're still like shiny (160:11 - 160:15)
hunting Mudkip or whatever like I it (160:12 - 160:17)
makes sense in the sense of like hey we (160:15 - 160:19)
just want you to like play our video (160:17 - 160:20)
game we're proud of this we want you to (160:19 - 160:22)
see the ending (160:20 - 160:27)
like just finish our game plays um shiny (160:22 - 160:29)
locks have never here's my so my hot (160:27 - 160:31)
take is shiny locks have never bothered (160:29 - 160:33)
me ever I've never thought about it it's (160:31 - 160:36)
never stressed me out like if like when (160:33 - 160:38)
somebody was like Cub Fu shiny locked I (160:36 - 160:40)
was like don't care he will I will get (160:38 - 160:43)
his shiny one day I uh am very (160:40 - 160:45)
privileged I get to play Pokemon as a (160:43 - 160:47)
job I've been shiny hunting for six (160:45 - 160:51)
years I have probably 900 unique shinies (160:47 - 160:54)
throughout Pokemon go sun and moon (160:51 - 160:55)
Diamond and Pearl like like every (160:54 - 160:57)
Pokemon game mag I got shinies from (160:55 - 160:58)
Coliseum I got shinies from Gale of (160:57 - 160:59)
Darkness I got shinies from fire red (160:58 - 161:01)
leaf green I got them all I got shinies (160:59 - 161:03)
from Pokemon Crystal we I got shinies (161:01 - 161:06)
for days every game I'm swimming in them (161:03 - 161:08)
I have so many Shiny Pokemon that I (161:06 - 161:10)
don't even have them organized yet (161:08 - 161:12)
they're just in boxes and boxes I still (161:10 - 161:14)
have over a hundred shinies in X and Y (161:12 - 161:16)
that I have not moved into Pokemon home (161:14 - 161:17)
because I wanted to get ribbons on them (161:16 - 161:20)
before I moved them like I have 800 (161:17 - 161:22)
unique shinies you know what that means (161:20 - 161:26)
I have 500 Pokemon I don't have shiny (161:22 - 161:29)
and that was after six years so for me (161:26 - 161:31)
shiny locks have never bothered me (161:29 - 161:35)
because it's like I I got things to hunt (161:31 - 161:38)
I still don't have a shiny furu well no (161:35 - 161:39)
that's not true I did get a shiny furu (161:38 - 161:42)
recently in Pokémon go I have one now I (161:39 - 161:43)
I'm trying to think of a Pokemon in the (161:42 - 161:47)
Indigo disc that I don't have shiny this (161:43 - 161:48)
was my problem though with Legends is so (161:47 - 161:50)
many people were like oh man I love (161:48 - 161:51)
shiny hunting the Legends and I got to (161:50 - 161:53)
Legends and I was (161:51 - 161:56)
like I have all of this like like oh you (161:53 - 161:58)
know what I didn't have I literally said (161:56 - 162:00)
this this week I like because we were (161:58 - 162:02)
talking about shiny locks Al is right (162:00 - 162:03)
there's like a clip of me saying like (162:02 - 162:05)
why would you I was so dismiss I was (162:03 - 162:06)
like why did you think they were shiny (162:05 - 162:07)
locked and then I was and then I brought (162:06 - 162:09)
up Legends and I would say the only (162:07 - 162:12)
shiny I didn't get in Legends was huian (162:09 - 162:14)
quilf I have the Weir deers I have the (162:12 - 162:16)
ursul Lunas I have the cleavers I have (162:14 - 162:18)
everything else my first shiny in Indigo (162:16 - 162:21)
disc was Hui and Quil fish so now that's (162:18 - 162:23)
checked off the list but like for me (162:21 - 162:26)
it's never bothered me um because like I (162:23 - 162:29)
said I have 500 some Pokemon to shiny (162:26 - 162:35)
hunt and if K Fu or glri or Spectre were (162:29 - 162:38)
not shiny locked I would consider (162:35 - 162:40)
hunting them depending on what the (162:38 - 162:42)
method was if the method was like turn (162:40 - 162:44)
your console off and turn it back on I'd (162:42 - 162:46)
be like m (162:44 - 162:48)
nah maybe later like I have again I have (162:46 - 162:49)
other Pokemon I can shiny hunt way (162:48 - 162:51)
faster and I would rather do that than (162:49 - 162:54)
to come back this and then as a Pokemon (162:51 - 162:56)
fan you're almost rewarded for waiting (162:54 - 162:58)
it out right like sometimes they give (162:56 - 163:00)
away shinies as distributions sometimes (162:58 - 163:02)
like something like Dynamax Venture (163:00 - 163:03)
comes along and you're like oh cool I (163:02 - 163:07)
could get it this way so I don't know I (163:03 - 163:09)
I I totally get like my favorite Pokemon (163:07 - 163:11)
of all time is ersy Fu I just want shiny (163:09 - 163:13)
Ury Fu I get that I I understand that (163:11 - 163:15)
like if your favorite Pokemon is shiny (163:13 - 163:16)
locked if your favorite Pokemon is (163:15 - 163:19)
Victini you have probably had tears for (163:16 - 163:21)
the last like 13 years because Victini (163:19 - 163:25)
is still shiny locked that doesn't (163:21 - 163:27)
separate like even though I don't care (163:25 - 163:29)
about shiny locks it's never bothered me (163:27 - 163:32)
I am so dumbfounded that they shiny lock (163:29 - 163:35)
these I just I I don't get it like I I (163:32 - 163:39)
think I get it but I but also like (163:35 - 163:42)
why like I think this is the thing right (163:39 - 163:45)
like I I like you I'm fine with them (163:42 - 163:47)
especially in their first games being (163:45 - 163:50)
shiny locked right like I get that I I (163:47 - 163:51)
understand that like we don't want you (163:50 - 163:53)
to just be obsessed with shinies just (163:51 - 163:55)
play the game and you'll get it catch (163:53 - 163:58)
the just catch the horse please finish (163:55 - 164:00)
this DLC I get that I totally get that (163:58 - 164:03)
cuz here's the thing right I'm I'm going (164:00 - 164:05)
to catch it the first time anyway right (164:03 - 164:06)
maybe I'll have another game if I if it (164:05 - 164:09)
wasn't shiny lock to do that whatever (164:06 - 164:11)
fine what I find really weird is when it (164:09 - 164:14)
when it stops having shiny logs on it (164:11 - 164:16)
the idea of putting a shiny Lo back on (164:14 - 164:19)
that there's I don't you're not going (164:16 - 164:22)
this is now rarer than it was because (164:19 - 164:23)
you could still get it in all the (164:22 - 164:27)
existing places especially when almost (164:23 - 164:29)
all of these Pokemon you can shiny hunt (164:27 - 164:32)
in Pokémon go right you part funnel (164:29 - 164:34)
money into that game you can get them (164:32 - 164:36)
all in a day right what I mean obviously (164:34 - 164:38)
it's time limited depending on when you (164:36 - 164:42)
can do it but it it's not hard or timec (164:38 - 164:44)
consuming to get them in go it just (164:42 - 164:47)
costs money right like that is money is (164:44 - 164:49)
time now money is time well it is right (164:47 - 164:51)
but that's the thing like that's that's (164:49 - 164:53)
where you can get them and so it's not (164:51 - 164:55)
like any of these other than obviously (164:53 - 164:57)
the ones that are have never been shiny (164:55 - 165:00)
unlocked right the specifically the (164:57 - 165:03)
sword and shield ones that all of them (165:00 - 165:05)
you could there are so many of them if (165:03 - 165:07)
you really want them to be right like I (165:05 - 165:09)
can I can go and get one someone can get (165:07 - 165:11)
me one it's not hard I just I want to I (165:09 - 165:13)
want to hunt it myself and I didn't do (165:11 - 165:15)
them in Dynamax Adventure just because I (165:13 - 165:18)
wasn't huge fan of that process it's (165:15 - 165:20)
just it's such a bizarre I guess I'm (165:18 - 165:24)
going back to shiny hunting and go (165:20 - 165:27)
then um so I understand shiny lock in (165:24 - 165:28)
the sense (165:27 - 165:31)
of th this is something you need to (165:28 - 165:32)
catch to progress the story what what we (165:31 - 165:34)
just talked about right like you need to (165:32 - 165:35)
catch Cub Fu to finish aisle of armor (165:34 - 165:37)
you need to catch a horse to finish (165:35 - 165:41)
Crown Tundra you need to catch the three (165:37 - 165:43)
birds to finish Crown tunder as well (165:41 - 165:47)
right like I get that and I'm I'm also (165:43 - 165:48)
okay with waiting a generation for them (165:47 - 165:50)
to be shiny locked because that's how it (165:48 - 165:52)
was right like these were shiny locked (165:50 - 165:53)
here next game they're not shiny locked (165:52 - 165:56)
get that understand that I have two (165:53 - 166:00)
theories um the first theory is (165:56 - 166:03)
that they couldn't get it to work (166:00 - 166:06)
whatever they were programming they ran (166:03 - 166:08)
out of time right like you gota you the (166:06 - 166:10)
game had to ship this year whatever (166:08 - 166:13)
method they were supposed to do was was (166:10 - 166:15)
was not supposed to work uh who knows (166:13 - 166:17)
what the method was if there was a (166:15 - 166:19)
method who knows if that or if there (166:17 - 166:23)
wasn't a method uh my thought process is (166:19 - 166:25)
that they looked at Dynamax adventure (166:23 - 166:29)
and they were like no one is catching (166:25 - 166:31)
these now I think about my Dynamax (166:29 - 166:33)
Adventure again very privileged I get to (166:31 - 166:37)
play Pokemon every day I caught three (166:33 - 166:39)
Pokemon in Dynamax Adventure I can think (166:37 - 166:42)
of all of them I caught a shiny landeras (166:39 - 166:43)
which took me (166:42 - 166:45)
forever but I wanted a shiny landeras (166:43 - 166:47)
for competitive so I did Dynamax (166:45 - 166:49)
Adventure over and over and over again (166:47 - 166:51)
and I finally got a shiny landeras and (166:49 - 166:54)
then I got a shiny guzzlord and I just (166:51 - 166:56)
got really lucky I was like you know (166:54 - 166:57)
guzzlord is one of the one Ultra Beast I (166:56 - 166:59)
don't have shiny I have a guzzlord (166:57 - 167:01)
Dynamax Adventure I'll do it and I think (166:59 - 167:02)
I did it like three times and I got (167:01 - 167:05)
shiny Gord and then I caught a non shiny (167:02 - 167:07)
Cartana because I had a tournament and I (167:05 - 167:09)
was like I need a Cartana I'm just gonna (167:07 - 167:10)
go through Dynamax Adventure don't care (167:09 - 167:12)
if it's shiny need to catch it I have (167:10 - 167:14)
never caught another shiny in Dynamax (167:12 - 167:16)
Adventure even though I've done a (167:14 - 167:19)
million Dynamax Adventures because I (167:16 - 167:21)
would get to the end and I would be like (167:19 - 167:24)
ah Ram I catch it next time I don't need (167:21 - 167:26)
it right now like I why would you catch (167:24 - 167:29)
it just it's not shiny so just come back (167:26 - 167:31)
later so I wonder if they looked at that (167:29 - 167:33)
they were like no one is catching our (167:31 - 167:36)
legendary Pokemon because it's not a (167:33 - 167:38)
different color and they were like we're (167:36 - 167:39)
gonna we're going to stick it to you (167:38 - 167:41)
guys because you guys complained about (167:39 - 167:43)
our frame rate now you don't get (167:41 - 167:46)
shinies it's possible that that's logic (167:43 - 167:48)
but I I don't I don't think it makes (167:46 - 167:52)
sense so I think probably most people (167:48 - 167:53)
aren't catching those legendaries and I (167:52 - 167:55)
think a large chunk of those people is (167:53 - 167:56)
because they want they're shiny hunting (167:55 - 167:59)
them and you get bored after a while but (167:56 - 168:01)
I suspect it's also because it's just (167:59 - 168:02)
it's a lot of work to do Dynamax (168:01 - 168:04)
Adventures right so the people who (168:02 - 168:06)
aren't shiny hunting aren't going to do (168:04 - 168:09)
it anyway right these ones are much (168:06 - 168:12)
simpler I don't think there's a huge (168:09 - 168:15)
overlap between people who would shiny (168:12 - 168:17)
hun the legend legendaries and people (168:15 - 168:18)
who would catch them if they weren't (168:17 - 168:22)
shiny because I already have a hundred (168:18 - 168:23)
of (168:22 - 168:26)
them like I don't why do I care about (168:23 - 168:30)
this particular Rayquaza as you say like (168:26 - 168:32)
why why why would I yeah like I mean the (168:30 - 168:34)
only exciting ones here are are the the (168:32 - 168:37)
horses and the KUB fu yeah those are the (168:34 - 168:40)
actual exting ones but I just yeah it's (168:37 - 168:42)
bizarre I don't I don't think that (168:40 - 168:45)
that's going to make people CCH them (168:42 - 168:48)
yeah you know I would I mean like I was (168:45 - 168:49)
excited if they were marked I was (168:48 - 168:51)
excited if they could be big or small I (168:49 - 168:54)
don't think they can be um I would maybe (168:51 - 168:55)
understand if there was like some story (168:54 - 169:00)
to it but as far as I'm understanding (168:55 - 169:00)
are cool there's no debate like we've (169:15 - 169:18)
talked about this last week where like (169:17 - 169:21)
people came back for Mewtwo people would (169:18 - 169:24)
come back if they wanted like people (169:21 - 169:27)
were very like oh Diago Pia here like I (169:24 - 169:30)
I still cannot believe how many people (169:27 - 169:32)
was like came back for Diago Palkia like (169:30 - 169:34)
I like Al I have a million Diago and (169:32 - 169:35)
Palkia I just have so many of them (169:34 - 169:38)
they've been around for 15 plus years (169:35 - 169:40)
yeah yeah I mean they've figured out (169:38 - 169:41)
that people come back for legendary (169:40 - 169:43)
Pokemon and people come back for (169:41 - 169:44)
starters and they've finally implemented (169:43 - 169:48)
a game where they have largely done most (169:44 - 169:50)
of both of that but don't worry we'll (169:48 - 169:51)
get a third DLC they'll bring back (169:50 - 169:54)
Beedrill that'll really bring back the (169:51 - 169:56)
masses and this is the other thing is (169:54 - 169:58)
like I I wondered when I first saw it (169:56 - 170:00)
was oh is this because they want to put (169:58 - 170:02)
them in raids and they want you to get (170:00 - 170:03)
the shiny in the raids but they've not (170:02 - 170:05)
they've not really done that either (170:03 - 170:07)
we're we're over a year past this game (170:05 - 170:09)
and they haven't done it at all they (170:07 - 170:11)
didn't do it in sord and I think there (170:09 - 170:14)
was the there was the Mewtwo that could (170:11 - 170:16)
be shiny but you could catch it no that (170:14 - 170:18)
was zoraa oh it was zoraa was shiny (170:16 - 170:20)
catch it but they haven't done another (170:18 - 170:22)
shiny legendary in any of the raids in (170:20 - 170:23)
either of the games they've done raids (170:22 - 170:27)
in so just it's not even that I still (170:23 - 170:28)
think for Pokemon day they're going to (170:27 - 170:31)
do Shiny Rayquaza to line up with the (170:28 - 170:33)
anime and that you could catch that one (170:31 - 170:36)
shiny ricka in a sevenstar raid I I (170:33 - 170:38)
think that I still think (170:36 - 170:42)
that's coming you can look I you can (170:38 - 170:43)
clip that that's (170:42 - 170:46)
fine I I don't know how else you what (170:43 - 170:48)
else would be exciting to celebrate (170:46 - 170:50)
Pokemon day especially now that we know (170:48 - 170:52)
the anime is coming out two days (170:50 - 170:54)
beforehand and the second episode of the (170:52 - 170:56)
anime has shiny Ray quazo doesn't it I (170:54 - 170:57)
think it's the second episode where they (170:56 - 171:01)
see it um you're assuming a lot of uh (170:57 - 171:03)
coordination there between Japan and (171:01 - 171:05)
America though um which doesn't always (171:03 - 171:09)
happen with yeah that's true but like (171:05 - 171:12)
what how can they top Mewtwo like Shiny (171:09 - 171:14)
Rayquaza can definitely top Mewtwo and (171:12 - 171:16)
they they they had to have known that (171:14 - 171:20)
like Mewtwo made returning game things (171:16 - 171:23)
Spike yeah I just feel like if that was (171:20 - 171:24)
the case they wouldn't have put him in (171:23 - 171:27)
the game as a as an encounter right (171:24 - 171:28)
because it's like Diaga and palia they (171:27 - 171:29)
just did they're not they're not (171:28 - 171:32)
Encounters in the game so I feel like (171:29 - 171:34)
they they've kept out some of them so (171:32 - 171:37)
that they can do them as as raids I feel (171:34 - 171:38)
like they wouldn't then do that with (171:37 - 171:40)
reaza I don't know I mean I wouldn't be (171:38 - 171:44)
surprised if like xerus and z uh not (171:40 - 171:48)
zygard uh yeal show up in raids like one (171:44 - 171:51)
is for scarlet one is for Violet like (171:48 - 171:53)
that that none of that would surprise me (171:51 - 171:54)
I don't yeah I don't think they're (171:53 - 171:56)
saving shinies for raids specifically (171:54 - 171:59)
because they haven't really done that (171:56 - 172:02)
um I I don't know if this is like we can (171:59 - 172:04)
get away with this now of (172:02 - 172:07)
like like I I also don't think that (172:04 - 172:09)
there's a person out there that's like (172:07 - 172:12)
sitting on the fence for the DLC and (172:09 - 172:14)
they're like hm I would only buy the I (172:12 - 172:17)
would only spend $40 on this if I could (172:14 - 172:20)
shiny hunt Cub Fu there might be like (172:17 - 172:23)
one one person they're watching this (172:20 - 172:25)
video right now someone they're they're (172:23 - 172:28)
typing they're typing it's me it's me I (172:25 - 172:30)
would have spent $40 on shiny cup food (172:28 - 172:32)
but I like I look forward to seeing your (172:30 - 172:34)
comment (172:32 - 172:37)
commenter that was me like but like in (172:34 - 172:40)
reality like it whether you're making a (172:37 - 172:44)
Pokemon game or a Halo game or whatever (172:40 - 172:46)
you are making it to appeal to as many (172:44 - 172:49)
people as possible and like maybe game (172:46 - 172:51)
freak I again I'm not justifying the (172:49 - 172:53)
shiny lock I think it's I think it's I (172:51 - 172:55)
think it's silly I think it's really (172:53 - 172:59)
weird I cannot believe that they did it (172:55 - 173:02)
but and also Pro like shiny Hunters are (172:59 - 173:05)
in such a minority like while shiny (173:02 - 173:07)
hunting is very popular and while maybe (173:05 - 173:09)
on Pokemon circles that you're in (173:07 - 173:11)
whether that's Twitter or Instagram or (173:09 - 173:13)
Discord you'll see a lot those are (173:11 - 173:17)
hardcore pokem fans like the majority of (173:13 - 173:20)
people do not shiny hunt that's true but (173:17 - 173:23)
it has become more popular yeah no it (173:20 - 173:25)
has become more accepted I think Pokemon (173:23 - 173:28)
go plays a huge part in that um but (173:25 - 173:29)
there are still people who play Pokemon (173:28 - 173:31)
go that literally play once a month and (173:29 - 173:33)
the day they play is commun day and they (173:31 - 173:35)
play because their friends are playing (173:33 - 173:37)
The increased odds they're usually roped (173:35 - 173:39)
out like Greg doesn't play Pokemon go at (173:37 - 173:41)
all anymore he plays when I'm like hey (173:39 - 173:42)
CG you want to come to commun and then (173:41 - 173:43)
he shows up I don't think he opens the (173:42 - 173:45)
app any other time (173:43 - 173:48)
he is literally that person I think I (173:45 - 173:49)
mean you could yeah you could go back to (173:48 - 173:51)
like discussing about what we did at the (173:49 - 173:53)
beginning which is with the battle tower (173:51 - 173:55)
and but this is so different from that (173:53 - 173:57)
because this is like they didn't need to (173:55 - 173:58)
implement something different for this (173:57 - 174:00)
they've done all that work the Pokemon (173:58 - 174:03)
exist the encounters exist the shiny (174:00 - 174:05)
code in the game exists they've just (174:03 - 174:08)
said but this one can't be right like (174:05 - 174:10)
it's it's very it's like if they turn (174:08 - 174:12)
that off it's not like nothing would (174:10 - 174:14)
work it would work right you might have (174:12 - 174:15)
terrible odds (174:14 - 174:17)
but I don't think anybody's like oh I (174:15 - 174:18)
can't believe they didn't give us one in (174:17 - 174:21)
25 odds right like it's going to be hard (174:18 - 174:24)
I mean somebody would say that too oh (174:21 - 174:25)
okay right yeah okay sure fine someone's (174:24 - 174:27)
going to say it but most people would be (174:25 - 174:29)
like no you're silly right the reason (174:27 - 174:31)
the lower the the lower the odds the (174:29 - 174:34)
harder it is to do a thing generally but (174:31 - 174:36)
lower odds higher odds doesn't matter (174:34 - 174:37)
but it's not like they haven't (174:36 - 174:39)
implemented a feature it's they've (174:37 - 174:41)
explicitly said this is exempt from the (174:39 - 174:44)
feature that exists in the game that's (174:41 - 174:47)
the weird thing about this yeah (174:44 - 174:50)
um I don't know I haven't done any of (174:47 - 174:52)
snack worth Quest but I'm assuming you (174:50 - 174:53)
just give them the snacks and then go to (174:52 - 174:55)
the legend spot it's there and you just (174:53 - 174:56)
catch it I'm assuming that's all there (174:55 - 174:58)
is to it with some (174:56 - 175:00)
dialogue like (174:58 - 175:02)
I I I think maybe going back to my (175:00 - 175:04)
theory that they didn't know how to do (175:02 - 175:07)
it like when like like when does it (175:04 - 175:09)
spawn like can you can you have both (175:07 - 175:12)
like Rayquaza and Cub Fu and gler on the (175:09 - 175:15)
map at the same time I'm not sure (175:12 - 175:16)
actually I've not looked into that I do (175:15 - 175:18)
I do know that even though the locations (175:16 - 175:19)
are fixed you still have to go and talk (175:18 - 175:21)
to (175:19 - 175:21)
where it's like a free update yeah (175:45 - 175:49)
there's definitely not going to be a (175:48 - 175:52)
third third but I I don't I I don't know (175:49 - 175:55)
how they sell us a third DLC no like I (175:52 - 175:57)
don't know how they sell us for a third (175:55 - 176:00)
DLC because people will buy dlc's for (175:57 - 176:02)
starters and legends we know this for (176:00 - 176:05)
sure people are not going to buy a DLC (176:02 - 176:06)
for (176:05 - 176:09)
Beedrill or the other turn off the shiny (176:06 - 176:13)
lock or or the other 200 Pokemon usually (176:09 - 176:15)
Legend like usually Legends and that (176:13 - 176:18)
stuff are like the end of like we're (176:15 - 176:21)
done with this I also don't think (176:18 - 176:24)
like I'm just I just don't want I I just (176:21 - 176:25)
don't want to pay for more content in (176:24 - 176:29)
this engine like just move on to gen 10 (176:25 - 176:31)
like the frame rate is bad we're still (176:29 - 176:32)
falling through the floor the game is (176:31 - 176:35)
still glitchy like you've you've done (176:32 - 176:37)
what you could you've already gave us (176:35 - 176:40)
two DLCs things are not better it's fine (176:37 - 176:42)
the people who love it like myself like (176:40 - 176:44)
everyone probably may be listening to (176:42 - 176:45)
the show (176:44 - 176:46)
we we we have suffered through it (176:45 - 176:48)
because there is (176:46 - 176:51)
something Charming to these games it's (176:48 - 176:52)
just held back like these these could be (176:51 - 176:54)
the best Pokemon games of all times if (176:52 - 176:56)
it wasn't for all like 10 little (176:54 - 176:58)
technical issues and I wouldn't I guess (176:56 - 177:00)
I wouldn't say frame rate is little like (176:58 - 177:03)
that's a big issue but like these games (177:00 - 177:04)
are so close to being like generally (177:03 - 177:06)
some of the best games like graphically (177:04 - 177:08)
they could look better they could run (177:06 - 177:10)
better maybe have like more stuff in the (177:08 - 177:12)
towns but obviously they can't because (177:10 - 177:13)
that would make it run worse like a (177:12 - 177:15)
totally like uh We've we've talked about (177:13 - 177:18)
this to death um yeah I I don't see a (177:15 - 177:22)
third paid DLC nor do I (177:18 - 177:26)
see they they be they being the Nintendo (177:22 - 177:28)
being able to Market that like what are (177:26 - 177:31)
you getting this time that like they (177:28 - 177:33)
they starters and legends are the top (177:31 - 177:35)
that they can offer and they they did (177:33 - 177:39)
they offered it um (177:35 - 177:39)
but I guess that'll lead to the podcast (177:39 - 177:43)
next week there's a lot of things (177:42 - 177:45)
unanswered (177:43 - 177:46)
and (177:45 - 177:48)
there's I thought they were in the game (177:46 - 177:50)
