[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 250 fifth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host SB j and with me today i have wheel yeah and i had like a thousand goose all prepared and it just took us so long to get ready to set up i forgot all of them took us so once when you're old long yeah we have we don't have Travis here today they are working they are at their day job wink wink but we have we have Micah what is it what does that warrant winks at what what why does it not warrant winks and I mean anytime winking is involved I'm fine with it actually what's up guys anything like a wink when you make a joke about a vampire having a day job you go wink wink oh oh I see I understand yes words we are here today to bring you an episode of sort so where we get off topic which we normally do which actually we might not be off topic because I want to talk about pokemon snap the episode is going to be we got a little bit of pokemon news and then we're going to take a break and we have an interview with bredren who is an NXT superstar if you if you're unfamiliar and next NXT is wrestling it is a division that is part of WWE it's mostly for development purposes before those superstars move to the WWE roster we we rarely talk about wrestling I think out of the out of the 30 40 minute interview there's one or two wrestling related questions but he is a huge pokemon fan so we talked about that yeah and then after that interview we have listener emails and since Travis isn't here our slack community has provided us move set for our pokemon of the week and i will attempt to tackle that or maybe I'll maybe I'll make will tackle it hey I never played football and so yeah that that is our show for you guys today with that being said as anything new or relevant in your guys's life oh no nothing new or relevant for me mm-hmm no no not that endows when you're serious the switch not even I hate both of you right now I just had my birthday like three days ago you're like you're like 54 now right yes yes I'm like 54 lion vivid some weird metric time system I'm pretty sure you're 42 now can we scream sings the right that will no no no no don't know why not has that's because that's a trademark yeah we don't want to get oh that's right I get sued copyrighted what a world we live in we doing they say that alternate version of it it is your birthday the whole world you were living it's all this is what happens now is good man music in every episode this is what it comes to let me let me tell you what Mike and I did last night oh boy we we played some we watched an episode of Seinfeld as well as we do when we're always together correct ah this house for you at were you at your house or your house your house your house now you weren't at my hair Jesus where we're at my house with the goal of the night was to get together and play some switch games all the switch while the switch hammers were gonna get together in their super switch club and place which together and be like look I can take my switch from my house to your house and play switch at your house I'm so stuck on your joy cons with my joy comes the best part of last night as we watch the seinfeld episode called the switch that's true we did okay so people aren't the worst so yeah the seinfeld is is for the worst type of people so we played snipper clips snipper Clippers never credible snapper claps I came to the conclusion because I also stream that earlier in the day that Irene hates that game she definitely said more than once when we were playing it I hate this game which she didn't say at all during the stream she blamed a lot of it on the controller but I feel like it was just touching the wall which makes the controller inputs not work which casting you don't want to say while you're playing the game that you hate the game that's true otherwise what is the incentive for people to watch I mean if you go back and watch a stream and I'll put it on YouTube there's moments of frustration with both of us which i think that the game like i'm gerry Thank You Nagaina too that's what it's supposed to do right communication and stuff oh yeah I popped into a friend's stream who was it was a couple and they were streaming it to separate from you guys and they were struggling through many of the puzzles and it was very infuriating were they just screaming at each other did they get to that point no there were definitely points where the lake I could tell that if they weren't on camera in front of people they probably would have been fighting but I feel like they didn't let fly on Air I feel like that would have been my stream too I was just like uh there's a point where I'm trying to tell Irene to do something and she's she's not listening and then I'm trying to explain it and she's like will you just explain it and I was like I'm trying to but you keep it arresting me all right let me translate that for the listeners as I've played video games with Steve before the thing is if you're playing a game not in the way that Steve wants you to play the game then he thinks you're playing the game wrong that is so untrue will already one hundred percent current will always paint this bad picture of me because you're horrible I'm extremely helpful in video games and Micah can vouch for that as I spent countless nights in a single week staying up till 4am helping him gauges year to destiny garbage that isn't even worth anything anymore right it was it was a trooper and I appreciated it until they announce destiny 2 and then now I don't care anymore guess who's a happy one here hidden waste his time on all that destiny star all the time isn't even really what I care about is the money that I was it okay so somebody could conversations happening so we did snipper clips again then we moved on to one to switch I posted a pretty long thing in in slack of my feelings of one to switch pretty much I just don't think it's worth the fifty dollars and this is coming from somebody who bought we play wii sports resort nitendo and I all I I even though those games were kind of shallow like I felt like I didn't waste my fifty dollars like i felt like i got fifty dollars worth of fun out of those games but those games weren't fifty dollars were they nutella landlords came with it wii sports resort came with a wiimote plus or whatever and that was like 50 bucks that's true at the wiimote with it like they were all fairly discounted from whatever land was 50 unless you got it with the deluxe edition right and it came with a guy which is how i feel i would feel less scornful i guess about my purchase of one to switch if it had come with the system and had been like part of like bundled into it it should have been introductory software it shouldn't have been a fifty-dollar game a full price 50 other game so after Steve explains why he doesn't think one two switches worth fifty dollars i'm going to posit a question but but complete your thoughts sir no i'm not gonna explain that i explained it's like that's all I'm saying yeah I don't have to read that come on give me the I don't want to dwell on the one to switch okay so in the water switch all right hold on so after 12 switch we're getting back to the initial point of the conversation of what Mike and I ended up doing which is first we ended up looking at terrible ps4 themes that cost money dynamic themes that cost money that were clearly made by who who knows but they were awful and then that somehow went down a rabbit hole of oh I ok I remember what started it so when Micah and I and Irene originally watched the two first two episodes of the sun and moon anime see it all comes back to Pokemon we watched them on YouTube some pirated version which which had no English theme song so I was very definitely watch them lose legit we want legit versions of them nope nope then since disney XD has shown those and my playstation view records those episodes I was like Oh Myka I listened to the sun and moon theme song here it is and so I pulled that up we watched it because we were already on my playstation and i still think the sun and moon theme song not catchy not good I on the other hand felt that it was amazing I really liked it said I I said I like this better than I feel like I've liked any of the previous ones aside from like the couple early ones and so then then we watched a 15-minute YouTube video of all the pokemon songs back to back theme songs joto has some really good songs they're all good and then it's like this journey of there's one like kind of nickelback II kind of vocals and they like kind of let that guy go and then they brought in this female artist and she's got a really amazing voice it's like powerful whatever and then they brought the other guy back but they're like you got a match with her so then they were to do it it was like the history of pokemon theme song singers the first seven seasons which I think are no I think it's the first six that are canto in johto and then you get to Hoenn which is it's very apparent that one all the Hoenn music is terrible except maybe the last season of Hoenn and the animation quality is really terrible compared to the animation quality before and after diamond and pearl wasn't much better but then you go into diamond and pearl music and you're like this still isn't good but by the end of diamond pearl was like all right we're getting back to like Christian rock bands i was gonna say i didn't want to say anything cuz i don't want to offend anybody's faith although i don't know that that necessarily fens anybody's faith no I Christian Roddy's of those like that things sound to me yet like New Age Christian rock yeah I mean crate you can you can honestly say that that within the genre of Christian rock that there is a particular sound that is more prevalent than than other variations I mean you don't hear a lot of Christian rock that you would compare to like LCD soundsystem that there's a wide divergence fair enough I guess what I'm saying is I don't like it you don't like Christian rock I'm not a fan of Christian rock look I'm however I don't religious at all and there there's an animal theme like Christian quote-unquote rock bands that I have enjoyed throughout the years well okay I there I guess I could say that there are some but it it's not like man we're getting into some conversations here it's not like in your face I guess I think the thing about like Christian rock music is it's it it doesn't sound like that the Christian rock that I have liked does not sound like the Pokemon themes the poet the Christian rock music that sounds like the Pokemon themes is Christian mission rock music that I don't like so ultimately what you all agree on is it's a whole new world we live in is possibly the best pokemon theme song of all time that sounds really good give me that surrender moon theme on loop also high a lot of people keep asking me this on Twitter until sun and moon officially becomes available on disney XD i will not see it it isn't work together I when did they air I they aired februari eighth and tenth I think they've only have the two first episodes because my view recorded it off disney XD i keep doing a search on the like intelligent search by title on my DVR so i can add it to my recording and I comes at the only pokemon that's available is replays of pokemon XY yeah i have a lot of sexting is i don't know enough about this is disney XD named disney XD to like mimic the emoticon face of like wall-e kenji potentially so yes okay cuz that's all i hear any time anybody says it no that's what I thought too so black and white also I feel has good music will what are your opinions about this yet no I agree one hundred percent I I very thematically enjoyed black the black and white theme song and maybe the YouTube video didn't have everything but x and y was just a remix of the original theme song I was getting into that yeah that was good also I think there is a season in diamond and pearl that also remixes the original theme song like they do it a couple times throughout the 20-plus seasons of Pokemon but yeah we should we should have we should do one of those like long episodes where we where we listen to all the theme songs and then rank them and analyze them and analyze have to have a four hour episode for special guests only where we have a discussion of every pokemon theme song ever I will bring examples of Christian rock new-age Christian rock music for my understanding you are allowed to play copyrighted audio legally as long as you're doing it to critique and or evaluate it fair use I think it's like no I don't think I don't think it's unfair use I think it's be I don't think it's the fair use clause thing or whatever I think it's something to do with review purposes oh isn't it like an amount of it there's there's a lot of vagaries in this law but I have access to resources that can give us very good guidance on what is and is not possible they're like that's why because there was there's a big this is off topic not that we have been on topic there was a big threat of like hey can i play songs in my podcast and people were like no those are copyrighted unless you have a list you have permission or whatever you can't do that they're like well what if I just do 15 seconds like that's fair use right and they're like no that doesn't apply like that's still somebody song and they're like well how does this movie podcast do it and it's like they're not playing it for people's enjoyment they're playing it to then talk about and evaluate the thing at hand and that's why it's okay here okay yeah as all right it's whatever okay so Pokemon music can we get back to my question yes I mean we're digging deep back into the conversation again okay but friday night i was at a bar with and it wasn't like a crowded bar so not crowded bar with four of my friends pink for gin from the previous episode was there uh so he'll probably remember for me but anyways my friend John showed up and he brought his switch with the two joy cons can choose a bar to the bar it wasn't a crowded bar you it was not a crowded bar and it's actually a bar where they have a wii u hooked up for that people can rent to play games and stuff oh ok but like the four of us were or five of us when John showed up were at a table you know not a lot of people around or anything like that and it was getting kind of dull just sitting there drinking beer and talking about how nerdy we all are would that have been a decent opportunity to play one to switch I think that there yeah I was saying I think that they're good like as long as you're in a group that's willing to play some games I feel like it's pretty accessible to anybody I would say no only because if you're in a restaurant like if I'm in a restaurant or a bar I guess while bar serves drinks and food it could be classified as a public setting of food drink taking place any time somebody's like watching a YouTube video or something with audio on their phone at the table across from me I'm instantly annoyed I feel like that's different in a bar setting though yeah let me make this clear number one all all DC bars are required to serve food so we can't really hold that to any crazy there's like literally only one bar in DC that's allowed to not serve food but our table where we were sitting was like right behind the pool tables so it was pretty much just like us sitting in a corner and like three pool tables around us separating you from it I get what you're saying Steve if we were at dennys and somebody broke out a switch and certain point what to switch I probably would be pretty upset but I feel great Christopher then upset I in my head I would say are you kidding me right now and then I would and then I would probably just eat my food and that would be the end of it but in a bar setting I could definitely see that as long as you and your friends are okay with embarrassing yourself in public oh absolutely i mean we were like eat for three years in at that point in time so that's like prime you like you're ready at that point for someone to switch all right all right I'll keep that to do a lot of waving your arms around and I mean it may be dangerous for the for the bar but now it yeah it wasn't it wasn't crowded then we were sitting in the section where if somebody had rented the wii u umm that's where they would have been i see well i had a pokemon snap story but i'll save it for for later yeah as we should get to Pokemon news here just a little bit of pokemon news first bit of news is the canto X illallah regional Rumble Wi-Fi tournament has been announced I don't know why I pause so much for that the Kanto times can't over solola I don't know what the x's canta x canto X oh Lola yeah that's kind of a cross is it cross over

these competitions they are hiding mega stones behind these competitions this is the worst this is that I'm not a fan of it I hope that at some point in the future it gives you the ability to to to access them without having to do that but I oh yeah I think they've said that okay they will be distributed differently in the future but if people want to get them in advance that they have to do these competition it's still I'm not a fan yeah for a four-game about collecting everything don't make me who's to say I like battling who's to say I have internet who's to say who's to say this is the weekend that I have free to do the event all I want is a mega pidgeot and I don't want to jump through circles to get it circles yeah swit I don't want to jump through switches to get it next bit of news here is get BP at the Battle tree global mission is now live the fourth global mission for Pokemon Sun and Moon is now live in this global mission players have to earn battle points at the

single heavy ball uh it's is this I'm out of loop on this and I fill me and if you know how many of these have they actually completed because I remember early on like nobody was they weren't getting completed on this is the fourth one the first two failed okay so the the one before this they passed yes that was the that was the trading over the GTS okay one before that was the QR codes and the one before that was was it trading catching I think about a ching like the first one was yeah catching wild Pokemon yeah and I think the problem with the first one is people just didn't know they had to talk to the lady first before they started the catching oh well I didn't know that so yep yep yep good stuff there is a new trailer for the 20th Pokemon movie Pocket Monsters the movie i choose you the trailer shows two different logos for the movie and several scenes being remade from episode one with addition of hoo dropping a rainbow win wing down to ash after which he says Pikachu Pikachu someday let's go meet that Pokemon together the official Japanese pokémon youtube channel has made the official japanese pokemon youtube channel and the official movie website have since been updated with the trailer a second teaser trailer and new artwork is now available I don't know if you to watch this trailer i watched it it's pretty much all scenes from the very first episode of Pokemon just remade in widescreen and not 20 years old I have not watched yet but I will yeah the only thing new like they said was the the whole scene with it dropping a rainbow wing down to ash and yeah I eat that first episode was you know what 22 minutes this movie is probably going to be a hundred minutes or 70 or 80 minutes I think most pokemon movies are like 70 or 80 minutes so I don't have 90 minutes they're not 90 so it's either 70 80 or 100 it's a world of know 90s yeah world of know 90s okay I can't remember a Pokemon movie actually more than 80 minutes long but but I could be wrong I could be wrong I guess I'm everything they showed was from the first episode so I'm I guess I'm just curious of where where that where they take that I don't I don't think it's bad I'm actually excited that they're redoing that I'm just curious of what the whole what the other 40 to 50 minutes are supposed to be you can now get Mewtwo's mega stones in Pokemon Sun and Moon evolving the

tubes to like tubes like it to your leg tubes to warmers well then they just like to you to be this yes and we are back from our break we are here with Brennan I he is a WWE / NXT superstar but also a huge gamer and apparently a lover of Pokemon so welcome thank you thanks for having me how are you man what's what's going on I am fantastic um you know just relaxing on my day off ready to talk about some pokemons I can't imagine a better time yeah I have a couple questions for you and I have a one listener email that was specific to to you so we'll go through all of that but before we dive into things just for just for our listeners and maybe some fans of you that that don't know the whole story who are who are you well my name is brennan williams i'm currently a WWE NXT superstar and the WWE developmental system i used to play professional football for the Houston Texans the Jacksonville Jaguars in the new england patriots and basically a football player well how am I often described i am a very big athlete with a the heart of a little nerd so that's where I get my popularity from that's where my marketability lies sure pulled pull your Wikipedia article up you are only 26 I am only 26 I feel every bit of 40 but I am 26 yes so I ki actually came up during the Polka mania okay yeah prime age 26 you have a football career you're now with NXT you're a gamer how you're you're a dad of two kids double dead yeah how do you fit all that in in life how have you done so much it's such a young age I guess is the question oh I set this goal for myself that I just want to do you know every every cool job that I ever wanted to do as a kid so right now I'm two for two and are they like three for three dads a job so real you know it's just it's all about compartmentalizing your time you can't dedicate too much to one thing or the other thing but just really focus on the thing you want to do when you've got time to do it unfortunately yeah the whole gaming is taking a bit of a back seat but handheld games are actually great for me because I can play them on the road and I can play them without my kids aren't allowed to watch TV yet so I can't you know play TV games while they're awake but I can play you know a DS game when they're around and just act like I'm on my phone ok let's talk about just growing up I was gaming a big part of that it was the biggest I always from when I was a little kid I guess the story the story of my descent into just awfulness is my dad played professional football before me played for 11 years for the Patriots the Jets and the Seahawks and back then they would go to training camp and they just kind of leave home and they'd be gone for a couple months for the summer and when he left I remember one summer vividly that he came but he would always come back with a gift and at the time I was really big into like Godzilla movies and Power Rangers so he brought back a dragon ball z one of those I don't know if you remember those box sets that if you put them all together they make a picture yeah yeah like one of those and then it was all anime and video games and everything downhill for the rest of my life ok so that that's that's what sparked the interest that's what sparked it yeah with somebody who had a father in professional football was was he cool with the whole video game thing or was it hey no you need to go outside you need to play sports stopping in the house will was there any tension like that or well I mean that's kind of the whole compartmentalizing thing I kind of got it from that point because I'd I mean I've always played football since I actually went into withdrawal last year because it was the first year since I was eight that I didn't so um there was a football was always around and then whenever I had time between football and school I could always play video games and do stuff like that my dad is a big tech guy not necessarily video games or anything like that but he was all about getting the newest tech stuff yeah I always had pretty up-to-date video game consoles and stuff like that where does the love of Pokemon fit in as soon as I saw the first commercial on it must have been like cartoon network in the late 90s for red and blue I saw it and I was like wow that looks really cool and I got on it and safer maybe I don't think I played it in college so i think i missed black and white but um i think i've played just about everything else from there Wow and I'm not I'm not one of these you know oh yeah I used to play first generation I play competitive stuff with my EVs and my IVs and my breeding and all that so I'm the realest fake nerd ever before we go really heavy on the pokemon stuff just getting these questions of the way how did you get into football was it because uh the football career i should say was it because of your dad or was it just something that you were passionate about growing up and then to follow up that question how did that football career transition into pro wrestling uh well when I was a kid I always wanted to do exactly what my dad did so at some point my dad had retired and he's now and became a financial advisor so I always said when I was little I was like I'm going to be a pro football player and then I'm gonna retire and be a financial advisor so I kind of always just it was he came naturally and I was good at it so football was just always football for me and but towards I think I started watching wrestling when I was maybe in middle school so after after at some point I started noticing I was like oh I'm big enough to be like one of these guys I can I could probably do this maybe because I'm not good with numbers I'm pretty awful at math I shouldn't be a financial advisor maybe after I retire from football after however many years I'll become a professional wrestler because that would be really cool and then I never have to get a desk job right so um yeah i mean the plan the plan has literally always been to play football as long as possible and then move on to wrestling because football is kind of football is very safe in terms of a career path and I knew people that were in it so I was much more comfortable in that environment but when it became time to move on and do something else wrestling was you know it was a leap of faith that ended up working out for me and so while you're while you're doing all this the video game things kind of obviously stuck and stayed I saw I saw you dead you did some YouTube stuff with the the channel the third wheel and you've done some other stuff you have a twitch channel so is that something you're I don't want to like bring up Austin Xavier woods Austin Creed but he does so much you he does so much video game stuff whether that's on twitch or YouTube or up up down down but do you see yourself going down that same kind of path or is it just a passion you have that you don't feel too you don't need to you know put out there as much as maybe I'll totally I've always wanted to that like I have a youtube channel that I got a bunch of subscribers and I just feel bad because I just never had the time to actually put stuff on it and I have a twitch channel but I just never have time to sit down and you know stream for a certain amount of time like that actually the whole up up down down thing and I'm actually friends with Austin from when I played football so though that whole thing is actually the perfect excuse to make because that's work that's for the company so yeah I can make you know I can make my hobby work and we're in the process of doing some pretty cool stuff hopefully I'm going to be more and more are involved in up up down down at least around the WWE Performance Center in Orlando because it's almost like its main roster guys don't have a home base and in NXT we are all based in Orlando so everybody comes through orlando even if their main roster guys if they just want to work out or they need to get a little extra training in or whatever so it's actually a really if we could set up something down here it would be really cool if we could you know just use that as a hub for that channel so i'm going to hopefully be involved in that going forward backing up a little bit let's let's talk about games specifically favorite pokemon game and then following that favorite non pokemon game favorite pokemon game i'm definitely a gen 3 baby really yeah I was always I don't know what it was about it because I know like I know all the complaints about it but I don't know I just really maybe I think that gen 3 might have been the first Pokemon game that I actually read and understood the story okay it wasn't just like hitting x over and over and plowing through yeah and the red and blue I was a dumb kid and then actually silver and gold that goes back to my dad being the tech guy he actually got me those early but those were in Japanese so I didn't know what the story wasn't that because I couldn't read sure and there after that uh ruby sapphire emerald that was I guess that would have been lived that act now that I think about it that was the first time that I actually read and understood the story to a Pokemon game so I guess it has a little bit of a safe soft spot in my heart so were you one of the were you one of the fanboys that freaked out when they remade it for Omega Ruby alpha sapphire oh yeah of course just his you know it's the nostalgia factor and I try not to get caught up too much and nostalgia stuff but totally what about non pokemon game that's such a broad question there's so much out that Pokemon games just like yeah it's like asking her um I mean you could do it you could do a couple I think when we had Austin on he went with the he went with Sonic and I think final fantasy oh and I feel bad because I can't remember but well uh love and always I'm talking about the persona games and shin megami tensei series I love JRPGs I kind of just love the isn't it the JRPG thing where you're just a kid and then by the end of the game you're fighting some concept of God or something like yeah yeah yeah I'll save save a little of that kind of thing yeah Oh jade empire a bioware game kind of one of the lesser-known ones but it's actually what it's actually my favorite original xbox was that yes original xbox it was a it was still along the lines of a bioware like kind of good good choice bad choice neutral choice kind of thing yeah but it's based around like a kung fu movie almost and I always go back and play that um those are the big ones I mean there's I mean there's a million button let me jump to this email here sorry I'm jumping around all a bit just sure it'll sound good in post this is from Kevin he is big fan of yours and big fan of its super fective and so well thank you Kevin he was actually one of the one of the many people who were suggested they're like hey you should get Brendan on and so I reached out to him and I was like hey well you're I know you're such a big fan of both of us what would you ask so he wrote in and he said dear SBJ and Brennan I've been a fan of the Shogun ever since he popped up on the friends cast quite a long time ago so I'm excited to see worlds collide after he shows up on my other beloved podcast it's super effective I cannot wait to hear the thoughts and the interview you to have he goes on and says Brennan I salute you for what you have accomplished tackling the NFL WWE fatherhood all while following pokemon other interests is amazing and even we are so close in age so it blows me away hats off to you SBJ props for you to putting in the work and making cool interviews like this happen you the effort you put into it super fective is unmatched and i think it shows how awesome people like brendan to take notice and join in my question for the sake of the interview if you had a wrestling persona based off a Pokemon who would you pick obviously ha lucha and in sinner or do not count as they are already wrestlers thanks for taking the time to read my email hope to see you both if you're in Atlanta sincerely Kevin well thank you for all the nice things Kevin but uh that's actually that's actually an easier question than you think because you also you didn't you eliminated halacha because that's an obvious one eliminated in sin Aurora because that's also an obvious one but emboar is actually if you look it up emboar looks and is heavily based on a great wrestler from the late 80s Early 90s Bam Bam Bigelow really allow you to make me like em Bor because I've always not been the biggest fan of em Bor that's actually what did it for me and there's it's it's actually crazy i don't think i don't see it a lot in a lot of places but like there it's uncanny like he bambam has like this Harry had he's passed unfortunately but he had this um like full body suit that had these flames and this like big fire collar and stuff like that he look like an M bore he really did that would be that would be my answer for all right speaking of of wrestling Pokemon how how did you feel when I mean gen-6 and gen7 both both seemed like yesterday but how do you feel when you see pokemon like halloo chaa or in cinema or hanging out and and oh it's so it's so can lucha Pikachu and you can I think you could honestly put together of the set of six guys that are all wrestlers at this point if you throw in like Hariyama that's a sumo wrestler and the champ has the belt that is Machamp obviously is bodybuilder or a wrestler but you know it's close enough it's it's awesome actually I remember because I actually got the opportunity to do a video for the pokemon company this past year for the 20th anniversary for their YouTube channel you did I think I saw this you Eric yeah this is a story you got let's hear it um well basically they hit me up on Twitter and they're like hey you want to do a video for you know the 20th anniversary I'm like sure and they it was awesome they sent me a bunch of like plush toys for my daughter I only had one daughter at the time but she's she's like well often or Pokemon journey right she's got almost all of the Pikachu close at this point except for like the den a or something like that yeah anyways when I did that that was last year so I had just started wrestling or I was in my first couple of months of wrestling and when that went up I don't know if you remember the what were they the Chinese leaks for gen7 yeah yeah that ended up being true yes they're heavy debate on the internet that because they had Jordin Sparks do one who's a singer and then they had me do one that's a wrestler if they had somebody who was an archer do a testimonial then that would confirm that the Chinese were okay that's that's really funny actually yeah so they reached out to you that you they did the Pokemon thing was that was that like a dream come true of like whole like the pokemon company this this franchise that I've been following has recognized me and wants to collaborate absolutely it's like you I've gotten to this point where you know I can actually reach out to and I'm nothing and as a wrestler or even as a football player but I guess me being a huge losers you know gotten me far enough that I can reach out to you know people like the super best friends that I've been a fan of for a long time or the pokemon company even that and do stuff and work with them so it is kind of like I opening and you know I think I put up a tweet as soon as it happened I was like who would have thought that when that kid stole my gameboy and third grade that I'd be on the Pokemon chill for a little bit behind the curtain I when I when I heard so much about you and I followed you on twitter you followed me back instantly and i saw i don't i have to ask like was it because you saw that i hosted a pokemon podcast was it because you knew that it's super effective was the thing like where was the i saw that you hosted it's super effective and I actually do have a friend that if not currently still does but he definitely did follow the podcast so as soon as I saw that I was like oh cool it's always good to make these connections and I thought we got it worked out pretty quickly I think right yeah yeah totally that was like the same with with Austin I messaged him on Twitter and he like message back instantly and then like two weeks later I'm flying out to plan on sitting in his house and of his nervous is all yes that's me that's what happens when you're big time like Austin I'm just I'm sitting in my poverty studio in my car in my garage going back to Bachmann to have you are you caught up have you played Sun and Moon I have played yeah I played and beat Sun and Moon pretty quickly yeah pretty early on and I think I haven't been on terribly recently but i did i was on a lot when the pokemon bank opened up because i had a lot of guys that i need to transfer over and how did you feel about that whole game it's it's obviously moving in a different direction slightly different no gyms what whoa for somebody who's been with the franchise since generation one what are your what are your thoughts what are your likes you don't like i always think it's good especially you know Pokemon has basically been the same thing forever so any kind of innovation or anything for to me is completely welcome i think they did some really cool stuff i actually prefer the idea of z moves to mega evolutions at least like in a competitive standpoint just because I've all I've always at least competitively if I've always gone from like the mindset that you could use whoever the heck you want but you can't use girafarig if you know yet there is there's never going to be a girafarig mega evolution you know you know if you could put on you know cool move that's a anybody can have it I thought that really mix stuff up and it made you know teams less predictable and stuff like that so I I like the I like the direction that it's going and I hope they keep on in future games there in whatever may be the third game for generation seven might be they keep on innovating because I think that that's that's really honestly how you compete you can't rest on your laurels for that long you know anything that stood out that in gen seven that you didn't really care for um not particularly i mean like there's a lot of like little things like okay they've completely done away with like hm's and stuff like that but that's kind of needed to go for a while at this one yeah a lot of a lot of just like ease of life things that they've done well I really like what was the super training in x and y mm-hmm I thought that was really helpful and it was easier for me to keep track of stuff for that so maybe if I wish there was something more like that in gen 7 but aside from that I'm pretty yeah I'm pretty cool what are what are your thoughts on any of the spin-off games whether that's poking tournament pokemon snap pokemon pinball is that something you dabble in yeah I haven't I I should have played poker in tournament by now but I actually still haven't played poker tournament um pokemon snap was one of my favorite games when I was a kid I really loved in college i think it was called pokemon conquest which was pokemon basically crossed dynasty warriors mm-hmm which i was like what the what the heck when did they do this and I thought that game was a lot of fun so yeah I'm just a Pokemon fan so any kind of you know any other way I can consume it i'm completely willing to you mentioned competitive battling and whatnot and that's that's a huge time sink but is that where your time goes is the battling or are you more of a collector or you know breeder or how there's so many different avenues in pokemon that somebody can go down but we're what avenue to use seem to pick probably just competitive and breeding i think at least breeding to me is such a it's like a mindless task almost it's almost like playing like snake on your phone or something like that yeah so like I can really do other things while I'm doing it and I can always just be working towards something and feel like I'm accomplishing something especially we travel for shows on the weekends and we usually have about three shows every weekend and these these shows for us at least an NXT are usually around the florida orlando area so nothing is further than three hours but in those two or three-hour car rides i'm always if i'm not driving i'm always in the back setting up teams or just you know just messing around with stuff and doing things like that are there are there other guys in the car on the on the bus or however you travel playing pokemon I ours is it just is it just you not in my car specifically but lincei Dorado who's one of the cruiserweights on raw and 205 live is also a big competitive Pokemon player that's been ducking me since he found out that I was so so I guess I guess I'll take this opportunity to officially call him out and you put them on display for everybody to see because I haven't seen him since the game came out all right put them on the spot here yeah we do have a handful of guys Sawyer Fulton is a is a player to Amber moon plays so there's there's a good it's a good amount of people i don't i don't think anybody's as good as me but they do play they own the game I've been told that Sasha banks and Tyler breeze or big Pokemon fans too I didn't I actually haven't met either of them but I believe it they got moved up from NXT about a year ago they've been gone since I've been here so is there is their favorite pokemon or multiple pokemon that you that you love that you have passion for any standing out to you pokemon i love and it's always for like weird reasons i love Sableye I love dodrio podria what an interesting choice yeah I know it's a weird choice right the drills like dodrio i really like because i found out he was like he could be really good yeah yeah I always I'm always when I'm just trying to come up with guys that I want to use I'm like oh who's nobody really using is like odo dreams got pretty good stats and pretty good moves I could actually use him okay if I had to pick one I don't even know if I could um yeah I don't know but yeah I like those guys all right I'd have to look in my box and see what really jumped out at me but yeah I'm always under the the mindset that my favorite Pokemon changes like per day per absolutely yeah i'll be really feeling one guy one day and then the other day it's something else for select it's always arbitrary reasons to it's like I spoke at at c2e2 last year and I'm going to be speaking at c2e2 coming up the chicago comic and entertainment expo but one of my fondest memories was this little girl she must have been four or five years old in and she came up to me after the panel and she watched the whole thing and and she seemed really like shy and excited and her dad was with her and was like oh like my daughter has a question for you and I was like okay fully like it's like there's so many generic Pokemon questions that that I've been asked over the years like you know favorite pokemon right that's that's kind of the yeah the base first one basically yeah and and she was so cute and she it took her a while to say it but she eventually was like what what pokemon do you hate and I just thought that was so adorable and super funny of like they're 700 Pokemon and you want me like the question you want to ask me is what pokemon i hate when do I hate and I think I said baskul in but I want to pass that question to you is there of it is there a single pokemon that like you you just you just don't feel for I mean like the easy answer is like the whole you know of vanilluxe is an ice cream cone but it's not like we didn't have stupid pokemon like from the start ya like like Voltorb just being a ball yeah voltorb just a ball um you know I never really had a problem with those maybe I don't like um in its I think it's actually gonna change now but just because I saw Kangas guns in every team for the past four years now I don't think I think yeah I think I hate kangaskhan okay alright that's fair personally I would prefer a more kangaroo looking Pokemon than Kangas like a straight-up kangaroo yeah and and when I think of that i always think of the the zelda game i think it's like Oracle of Ages or something with the kangaroo with the boxing gloves I said why don't we have that Pokemon same with Roger from Tekken kangaroo with boxing gloves yeah I don't know why that just seems to work they can they can have boxing gloves and though what's the crap crap brawler as boxing gloves yeah yeah alright so change topic real quick what are your goals / plans for 2017 anything specific standing out there gold / plans for 2017 I guess you know I'm always just striving since I've started this whole wrestling journey right it's I've been so used to football that it's it's been it was easy to me at the end kind of almost you didn't take a whole lot of thought you didn't have to train a whole lot to get you know significantly better so i think this year i just want to keep on working and basically just keeping my head down and I want to math you know i'm not going to do it in a year but i'm gonna work towards mastering this new craft that i'm in awesome what uh we covered so much where can our listeners find you where where can they follow you where can they see you obviously they can see you down at NXT but on twitter facebook youtube where are you n the WWE Network someday for 999 a month that but otherwise the best way to keep up with me is on my Twitter at great black otaku if you search great black otaku you could probably find me on anything else I'm I've gotten the branding thing down pretty good yeah so I don't necessarily keep up with that yet scrape like a chuckle and Instagram great black of choco on facebook it's it's all over the place so if you search anywhere else it's probably that but Twitter is where I do most of especially with I you know get to talk to cool guys like you this is where you'll find out that I do that some awesome well thank you so much for taking the time being on and what we'll do now is we'll take a quick break and when we come back we're going to do our pokemon of the week thanks for having me [Music] [Music] and we are back from our brick let's tackle some emails here you have any emails for us you can send in your message to SB j SS and steve be is in black jay is in junior at pkmn cast calm or you can go over to pokemon podcast calm hit that contact button that'll that'll send the email at the same place that both ways viable and yeah feel free to send in your emails about pokemon or not pokemon stuff will answer every and everything and anything noah rights in says hi just writing him to say i'm just writing in today to say that spj is my favorite that's it really i love will of travis as well i don't think i would have had the podcasts to listen to for the past few years without spj so he takes the cake hope you all like cake also thanks for keeping the house nice and clean Noah clean that house and where is this noah from doesn't know where do i rank on your list pretty low i would imagine so this Noah didn't identify a location know the location is required on pokémon podcast calm we're not required but but asked for so if they are you gonna set up snail mail written mail submissions hey people can send letters I've got plenty of letters I want to send you people consider I have a p.o box on on the patreon page the p.o box is there I don't I think it's on Pokemon podcast to [ __ ] there's a p.o box for Pokemon podcast feel so people can send you rocks that their own mega stone on yeah they can send me mega stone rocks yep slap a usps sticker on it call it a day stuff listen from Michelle from Rhode Island my assumption is the only Michelle in Rhode Island that would be my guest that's a very small state yeah probably coastline about Rhode Island is probably 30 cats big would be my my big weight is that we heard the ocean or excluding block island because block island is part of Rhode Island what do you think block island is like another 10 cats no no it's got a cat and a half okay apparently people from Rhode Island really hate when you say that they live on Long Island rather than in Long Island what are you even talking about Rhode Island and Long Island are such different places where where are we right now rhode island Oh Rhode Island yeah yeah on Rhode Island roa rhode island in rhode island now with that attitude which is why they hate it when we say they live on road i'll yeah i would imagine so Michelle on Rhode Island retin-a hi Steve Travis and will thanks I'm really enjoying the show thank you for the time you put in to make it fun for everyone since finishing son and completing the Lola pokedex congratulations by the way I've decided that I want to get involved with the VG sees i'm not totally new to competitive battling but the last time i played online was jen for when i was actively on the sarah b forums we use smog on rules for single battles it was only and it was a great time but I fell off for it for a few years when I went away to college gen 7 has made competitive battling more accessible than ever so I'm totally ready to get back in again but I have some reservations there are a few things that are different about the VGC format than I'm used to the biggest change is the lack of tier system that smogon uses and the other big changes for me is double battles I'm confident I can learn double battles so i guess i am most uncomfortable with the whole free for all that the VGC seems to be with no ladders and a short ban list I'm looking at the top winning teams for national competitions in London and I was disappointed to see almost all to see that most of those teams were almost on all the same nearly all had a taboo one or two ultra beasts and either a Salamence or Garchomp got news for you it's been like that for several years I'll admit that I've been looking with looking at this with a basis bias when I when I battled online with smogon rules I focused on the extreme diversity of the UU and nu tears I have the most fun when I battle with my favorite Pokemon and a tier system that means there's a little time in place for all of them to have a fair shot in battle I think that makes things more fun because the sad reality is that some pokemon are better in battle some pokemon are better than others with math being the limitation there are hundreds of Pokemon the vast majority of them will never rarely be seen unless there's a place carved out for them these top VGC teams was a reminder of that if I want to make a balanced team of my favorite oh Lola Pokemon it likely won't stand a chance against a team of top ooze ultra beasts and powerful dragons even with a solid theoretical strategy it probably wouldn't be competitive I could just jump on the bandwagon to make a team like the rest but that wouldn't just be that just wouldn't be fun for me personally personally the taboos and ultra beasts are cool pokemon they're just not my style I'd like to know what will and Travis Travis's thoughts are do you ever struggle with choosing Pokemon you like first Pokemon you know will perform its role better should I just roll in with my wish cash and lose and with my head held high or I'm looking at this all wrong I know you're not you don't play competitive SBJ but that's okay because you are my favorite on the show ah thanks again for the great podcast and sorry for the long email I hope it makes for an interesting conversation Michelle well I can give a relatively simple response to that because it and i will say that when i started in competitive i was very much about the I want to use my favorite Pokemon I want to use wish cash named tickles that has Fisher and make people angry because when Fisher hits so Dom yeah that one hit knockout but I have changed a little bit and it's it's kind of like changing the framework of the way that you think about VGC so yes smug on tears are set so that they can sort of be more balanced right and that gives you more diversity in the pokemon that you can choose and that's what the smog on system is intended to be and what it achieves I would argue at this point in time that VGC has become more like chess wherein each person playing chess doesn't bring different pieces that have different abilities to the chess board each side has the same pieces and the same all the pieces do the same things it's then how they use those pieces strategically to win or lose and there's still a tremendous amount of strategy I mean obviously people are playing chess for hundreds and hundreds of years and it's about the strategy and the options that you that you take when you're playing chess that then becomes the game and it's not about the actual individual pieces you know nobody cares more for the Queen than they do for the bishop or the king it's just the Queen does a particular action the bishop does a particular action and the pawns do their particular actions it's how you put them into play and I think that's what VGC has become where everybody has a clear understanding of these are the top Pokemon that you can use it's how you use them the timing of your moves your ability to predict what your opponent is going to do the selection of moves that can be placed on those pokemon I mean obviously are there is a little bit of variety because there are a few different options that can be switched in and out but ultimately you're going to be selecting from those the top tier of Pokemon and then it becomes about the strategy and how you play how you select how you swap things in and out which to you pair up how you predict who your opponent is going to put out first so it's just it's a different kind of game so trying to think of them the same way it's you're not going to be able to be successful they don't really compare it's like comparing like risk to chess you know there are two different games both fun in their own way but still two completely different games so if you start thinking about VGC more like chess and about strategy and learning strategies and how to do prediction and all that kind of stuff you may grow to appreciate it more than you currently do and I think that's all I have on that hahaha like what you're gonna think just do your best and maintain integrity or if you can't do that then just cheese it then uh don't listen to the haters i would say that much less eloquent than with yeah i mean the whole seeing that everyone uses the same teams has been a pretty big issue / I I think personally in the last couple years of the video game and I would actually say from what I've seen what I've heard this format is the most diverse it has been which isn't saying much as you are still seeing very similar teams to pick you back off what will said I will there's nothing wrong with picking the Pokemon you like and what you want to use I think it's more important to understand why those six Pokemon being used are being used why is taboo lele or top boo boo loo why are they being used and how are they being used and what can you do to counter that and i think that's that's just as important to I think that's more important than your own team is just understanding how these high-level teams are functioning through that my advice would be pick whatever top of Layla Bert a boo boo loo or whatever one you want that people are using pick a you be that other people are using pick a couple pick a Salamence or a goodra and then kind of experiment off of that and see if you can get any synergy because then you have the advantage of okay I'm you I'm using the same chess pieces that they are going off wills analogy but now i'm also bringing in a couple of my other personal pieces that number wise might not be as good but their pokemon i enjoy using and you at least have one advantage with with pokemon that aren't commonly seen and that advantage is people don't know what to do against that I think that's why pachirisu did so well in the 2015 video game championships maybe 2014 I'm sorry if I got that wrong but I think it was 15 because I was there the the the advantage that hot cherry sue had and why it made it why it won is because when people saw pachirisu they didn't know what to do with it they didn't know if they should have it they should attack it first if they should ignore it uh they didn't know what moves it had they didn't know they couldn't remember its ability and that's why it did so well is no one knew what to do with it I had success with that with myrrh actus when I played the video game back when black and white people saumur actus they didn't know whether to attack it first whether to ignore it whether to focus on it they didn't know if it could survive a certain hit they couldn't remember what interact his ability was and my advantage was if they ignored it that would have been the best for me because it was a defensive set up Pokemon so I the fact that they did ignore it did put me edited at an advantage that's just something to think about i'm not saying that's like the best route to go but i don't i mean i like that that's happening or that has happened because i think especially in an Internet age with competitive anything it's really hard to do something that offends the meta because everybody has access to the the same information and what works the best and how to how to make that work and I think situations like that where people are just throwing things into the mix that people don't know how to react to because it's not a part of the meta that's I don't know it's that's hilarious to me and also an amazing strategy in a double battle you're only using four of the six so I think that you should pick a team and try to stick with that team and then make minor adjustments as you go but I don't think there's anything wrong with using the Pokemon that other people are using while while it's not video game related in the in the TCG there was always these are the top 4 most popular decks they're pretty much virtually the same I think any TCG that's always how it's been yeah once people had easy access to the internet again it's yep and the thing about TCG which will apply to the video game is you can look at the card list you can look at the Pokemon list the Pokemon moves and there's a difference between somebody just handing you a deck and saying okay this is the best deck in the format and there's a difference of understanding actually how that deck works right with Darkrai Sableye which was one of the more popular decks in the format when I was playing it was very important when to play you're crushing hammers and you're in enhanced hammers I can't remember crushing hammers was the the important card like crushing hammer what it did is you roll a dice if you roll if you roll a dice if it's evens or flip a coin if it's heads you get to discard an energy from a Pokemon from your opponent's pokemon which is a very powerful card and the reason you would do that darkrai Sableye is to prevent them from attacking now what when you get the deck and you get the cards they don't tell you when to use crushing hammer and that's the difference between an average player and a really exceptional player is because the exceptional player will use crushing hammer on Pokemon add cific time or a Pokemon that's a threat that's all I'm saying is I think your first thing as somebody who's new to the VG sees not playing since diamond and pearl is understand why those four moves are there understand why that ability is there understand what when you see those two Pokemon together because most of the time in a doubles battle pokemon come out in pairs like you all like in the black and white days they always start with a torn Addis and like track yeah so understanding what to what to pokemon or opening or what to pokemon are closing or the pairings is what i'm getting at competitive to it it's something but now when I did competitive TCG my favorite thing was was building unique decks and I think the satisfaction I got wasn't necessarily winning it was somebody commenting on the creativity of my deck yeah having fun with that but you know just to carry on the TCG part right you have those top decks but think about a player like Jason closed in ski it's with him it's it's not about the cards in the deck it's the fact that he knows like every other build that he's going to see in a competition and he's able to memorize every card he see that sees it comes out like in play he knows how many of what card you have and if you've used them up or not he probably knows more about your deck what anything against it you do right says a lot about the skill it's not about the cards that are in the deck there's a lot of that in magic the gathering to a lot of like card counting and I mean people just SAT around and in downtime would just constantly play like the top eight net decks and look at all the combinations and how to react with whatever it was that you were using and it's I mean that's part of strategy and it's also part of living in an age where everybody has access to pretty much the same information you just gotta get that competitive strategic edge over I guess everybody else because they all have the same info that you have or you have to assume that they have the same info that you have competitive is is weird it's a it's something but yeah have fun with it I mean that that's that's hopefully why you're doing it right like I didn't I stopped playing the TCG when I stopped having fun and really the the thing that stops being fun was the travel and the time commitment and how poorly the events were organized like that's really what did it for me not so much the game itself there were changes in the game that I didn't really care for but it was really everything else around that and it just wasn't worth my time anymore to the the ratio of fun I was actually having so that's that's where I come from that so as long as you're going in with the VGC like I said uh don't be afraid to pick some of those you know Pokemon you might not like just to help form a base or a starting point and yeah don't be afraid to use Pokemon that you do like Pachirisu did extremely well and that Pokemon is not good number wise it was just how it was used around the other combinations that existed Martin rights in says dear poked my podcast folks you know what really grinds my gears everything from fan art to official merchandise the it's like an emoji the like like straight face the like smiley face that's not a smile is just like a line as all straight lines yeah that represents the disguised ditto and it winds me up every time I don't know why that one episode in series one where the where did Oh couldn't do faces until the end of the episode when it figures out and no other ditto has ever had this problem in 20 years now I know that it's a cool nod to the occasional plush of ditto and it's been difficult to give that nudge to give a nudge to show that it's a ditto otherwise I get it but grrrrrr rant over has this ever bothered you guys are just me keep up the good work no matter how far I am behind an other podcast this one always jumps straight to my top priorities Martin from England doesn't matter where in England it's smaller than all of your state's well not smaller than road I now run i would say that England is probably like 60 cats and rhode island is closer to 30 oh no England's like 120 cats you are forget wait are you just saying England are you including like Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland I would probably say just like England England oh okay so yeah okay England's probably about 60 cats and then you have to the rest of the United Kingdom would increase the number of cats by about 30 yeah geography it's a good geography discussion as for the ditto face I get what he's talking about I don't know I i I'm I think it's cute I think it's cute and I makes me want to buy more plushies which I can't believe I use the word plush I never used that word but I want to buy them all I want to get those cute little databases I'm on the same page yeah I think it's fine marketing-wise you want you want a face to be instantly distinct like instantly like oh I know that's a ditto I think it's also hilarious to see you Pokemon and then that face is on it you don't expect it also it's such a simple face right it's not it's not like it has a specific i type or specific mouth it's it's two diagonals I got to the line it's so simple so since that faces iconic like that it's very easy to pop on a bulbasaur to plop on a chikorita to plop on a you know Torchic actually I don't know how would work in a torchic I guess it just wouldn't have a beak II it's a good question it's good that that that is the question that needs to be answered ed marketing-wise I think that's why why it exists but I don't know I guess I don't have a problem with it I'm trying to think of what does grind my gears and nothing is standing out right now but i'll probably i can complain about something just give me give me some time well ok so if we want to complain about pokemon stuffed animals I what I would wish that they would stop doing is making stuffed animals of the larger more complex pokemon like honestly there is no way to make a good stuff to Kyurem so just don't do it right don't I don't think a stuffed Zekrom it's just gonna look dumb it always looks like garbage I don't I don't need nobody really needs a stuff fresh rim and it doesn't look good I stuff is earnest which kind of like just falls over because the legs aren't sitting now only an agentless EV Pokemon not having actually held it just looking at it on the site it's not enticing to buy I got speaking of plushies I got the mimic you plush I'm very jealous it's I mean you are over I didn't show to you it's uh it's really nice it stands which a lot of plushies have an issue with like standing straight up and it's not fur I don't know what to call it like the plush eNOS of it is real soft it's it's soft like the goomy blanket and I'd say that that was extra soft extra soft and so like I like the pokey doll plushies a lot I like the plushies that look like they're plushes and not the realistic plushies like you guys we're talking about like the kiram plush they try to make that look realistic and it looks like garbage but I like the the pokey pushes a lot I don't know they feel like a normal stuffed animal but the mimic you just feels like the material they used for the goomy blanket and I don't know probably some kind of cotton / polyester but I'm like looking at my for plushies above my head right now on a shelf I have a jirachi uh from poky center Mudkip from toys r us so I think it's like a Tommy one the beanbag Pikachu from poky center and the pikachu pokey doll from pokemon center and none of them feel as soft they all feels those all four of those feel similar I guess the Mudkip feels a little cheaper but the mimic you is on a different level of softness a spooky level of softness spooky softness I'm getting very jealous listen to me talk about this spooks I got it it's also pretty big I compared to other plushies I got for n it I think with so many cats heads probably about a half cat big that's pretty big yeah and it's decent size Micah when you go over to Steve's house and see if you can feel free to take your headphones off reb innate you don't go through his stuff um should I like it is all we have to start doing now always do one hundred percent of the time I always go through stuff huh that too goes to bed I'm like in everything alright well no now I know what I need to step up to you yeah you up you find some real nice stuff here i guess uh you would have had a minute you because it looks like mimic you is no longer on the Pokemon centers oh snap and I'm gonna lose my mind if that is the case breaking news haha do they sell out I don't it's not even listed did you go to a lowland polkadot Pokemon there's like unless there's a section for a lonely lonely merch oh maybe that's what it is it's under collections I think okay as you look that up I'll read Christine's email all right Christine from Concord California just found your show and I love it I've been doing a lot of Pokemon breeding and sun and moon and i found your podcasts to listen to while I do the breeding stuff I don't know why I a done braiding stuff I just felt like that was a better way to end the sentence I know history discussion on sylveon and offer the position that it was not designed to look girly forgive me for not citing in name but I just started listening and I can't dis Curran whose voices who's yet I have to disagree with you yes it's pink but beyond that the route there are ribbons as you acknowledge impose I think the point is well-taken that this does not identify it as a female but it is what we in the LGBTQ community would consider hi femme is that femm e da ya took it um also I say LGBTQ really slow cuz you gotta make sure you hit home yeah otherwise I just wanna learn them all together or I forget a letter it's cuz you're Steve so yeah I've asked in enough trouble talking as it is well let me finish this and then we will go back to this it bears cultural signifiers marked associated with one's gender and I think that's awesome Pokemon sensex's were introduced have had kind of a subversive gender sensibility to it to me that's a huge part of the appeal I love that my mail pre marina with sparkling lashed eyes and feminine mannerisms can face off against a stone cold butch female mud choke whereas in children's popular media you can find such a broad range of gender expressions regardless of sex personally I think it's great and I'm sure that there are some children out there that love it too anywho I'm not sure where you were coming from with your response just thought I'd added my two cents thanks pristine so I think I was the one who said something about how sylveon doesn't have to be necessarily feminine because it's pink and bows and everything and I would just argue also as a member of the LGBTQ community right you got every letter as a homosexual dude i would say that even as homosexuals we don't necessarily look into gender concepts in the same way as people who are more directly impacted by concepts of gender and in actuality concepts of feminine versus masculine are actually becoming more and more outdated um that just because culturally something was assigned to be masculine or feminine doesn't make it so right it's not eternally so etched in the fabric of the universe that pink bows are feminine and I don't know hard hats and shovels very masculine right that we need to break free from these concepts in order to better ourselves and better understanding of all humans who may feel like a little of both is perfectly fine for the way that they identify for their own gender expression and it's also very dangerous to identify things as say femme and Butch because we also have a tendency to assign bad too things that are feminine when neither concept that it's not good or bad or it's actually particularly feminine which would be associated to women it matters right it's it's just the way that something looks and I think one of the things I said which might have kind of gotten cut down a little bit was the fact that pink was originally a boy's color right and it was it was because pink was actually associated with blood and therefore it was considered to be more of a masculine color and then over time it became associated with little girls and became more feminine so ultimately these concepts are purely human creation they're not tied to anything eternal in the universe and it doesn't make any sense to keep ourselves tied down to outdated concepts when we can just say you know something is something and there's actually nothing humorous about a boy wearing pink bows because it's just a person wearing pink bows because they enjoy it and that's all that matters yeah well said I very well said I've also said this before but I like when I catch certain pokemon I want them to be a certain gender and I don't think that that's because it comes from Orion's are only male because they look mail I don't think it comes from that I think it comes from the same concept of like picking a pet all three cats in my house or mail and if I was to ever get another cat it would always it would continue to be a male cat I just always want boy cats and I think that just comes from me coming home and being like where my boys and then all three come running up oh good lord it's because you're a sexist pig yeah exactly I kid got me and so I think that's okay for people to go like I want a fennekin but I wanted male I don't think that that means like fennekin must be male just people have a preference like my dad he's he he's always had dogs but all his dogs have always been female like he's never wanted the male dog I don't know if there's a name for that or anything or if that's just like a want aura or a personal preference but that's just how I Fiona nism is the exactly that's the name right there I mean that was kind of a joke but that really shook I would argue that in this in in the context of a video game that relies on breeding and requiring specific genders for breeding it's a little bit different than like I don't know a perception like a global perception issue I think it's less I don't know I mean I i I've never really considered Pokemon to be like a shining example of inclusivity as far as gender cuts because it's just here you go this is the suppo c'mon it's this one's male this is female make them made there were good [ __ ] yeah slow slow steps little steps right so I mean I think I think from what you're saying as far as how you play pokemon or what you look for in pokemon or what you require out of it it's that's more from a gaming standpoint than it is from a like an actual gender perception yeah yeah I wasn't saying when I was just bringing up the case that it's because that's like that before and I didn't explain it like that so I didn't want anyone to be confused of like why do you only want male Pikachu well it's the same reason I only want male cats I don't know like when you picked your cat out if you did when you went to get your cat where you like did you talk with your wife of like I want a male cat or I want a female cuz she didn't know oh it was a it was a Christmas gift but you still had to pay got male or female or yes well orange or brown or black or so my friend Carlos and I we went to the humane society and we looked at the cats and I said this one is the prettiest because he absolutely was and the nameplate said Dean Martin was his like Humane Society given name and Carlos and I looked at each other and said that's the cat that's it that's it and so that that was it and then and now his is a huge jerk I love him but he's a huge jerk there was no real like I don't know I I don't really have any Brett like preference when I'm pick an animal that's I think that there are some for some people there are things that they look for specifically for I don't really I don't really know enough about it because I don't really look at I don't consider this when i'm looking at pets but like how certain like male or female cats or dogs will interact with environments or depending on your home situation what that could potentially mean for I don't know I don't know enough about it I it was not a factor though when I when I was looking at my pets my cat were my dog well I mean going back to Christine's email I don't know who said it looked girly unless I brought up that other people thought it looked girly because it was the letter writer oh okay the whole the whole point of the letter was that the letter writer thought it was funny that they had a male Sylvia okay as it was yeah I mean looking pretty pre marina I know like there was there were voices out there that pre marina looks extremely feminine and that that's fine like I would say that my logic and board looks extremely mail and that's fine I I guess that stuff has never bothered me yeah it sort of bothered me there so the only thing I would say is as kind of my last word on this is ninety-nine percent of the time when you apply a label to something that's usually a bad idea with masculine and feminine being labels I would agree with that yeah there's no argument there but now people people like pokemon for certain reasons and sylveon is really cool though no one's disagreeing there I love sylviane love Sylvia myself if I could rename my cat out maybe rename it this email is from Anthony from Long Island New York on Long Island or in Long Island oh you live on the island man you live on it but in Rhode you live in it yeah okay just wanted to say thank you SBJ for starting this podcast it has become one of my favorite podcasts and one of the few i can listen to every episode two or three times before three or two or three times and pick up something I missed during my first listen so I have a question that I've been meaning to write in and ask for weeks but I haven't had the time first question is for will what brand of protein or other supplements do you use before during and after at the gym I heard you mentioned a couple episodes back that places like GNC sell a lot of products that are basically junk and I want to use the best products and could you explain when to take each product I'm not trying to bulk up or lose weight just trying to turn my fat into muscle and be healthier second question who is the guy that recorded the podcast about a bay leaf what happened to them all three of you are my favorite plus i really like Irene and mica and they should be on the show more often well I got news for you there you go Micah you have a shout out finally my favorite Pokemon at the moment is electrum he has been a heavy hitter in omega ruby and moon would love to hear a good move set for the would love to hear a good moveset and partner pokemon for electro from travis PS i'm one of the fans that love the really long episodes thank you again for the podcast and all your hard work spj I have left a review at itunes to show my appreciation well thanks Anthony Travis isn't here so i'll put that elective on i'll give that a raincheck uh welcome what what pokemon is that I can't figure it out Oh electric iron is learner electro fire yeah sorry I like provider t Eyre elected election vire wait a minute hold on is it active ire and not electro fire electorate electivire there's no are after unless unless it's spelled wrong in this email there's no are ever that the neverland kid right starts at his elekid electabuzz electivire yeah that sounds right the toe poke my name's elektra fire pokemon names are hard who knew pokemon names would be so hard ah will yes sir give me some GNC stuff uh well we don't have to go with the name brand store because vitamin shoppe also sells large variety products on Electra Sutton this by the way okay I mean I'm gonna pin laughing yeah clanging banging clanking and banging no I mean I've been doing a lot of cardio and I will while i'm at the gym i'll also do weight training stuff because what what else would I do I'm not just gonna do cardio while I'm there I'm not paying 40 bucks a month for to run cardio wow I wish my gym membership was 40 bucks a month whoo boy what is yours that's over 100 oh my god hahaha less than your white hat for training the White House yeah the the gym I can literally see my gym from where I am sitting right now in my house it's around the corner from my house thank God I guys can see membership to the light into the White House gym yeah and I also live around the corner from the White House hahaha oh the big city boys things are expensive I don't think it I don't think DC is that big that's bigger than when you live well I don't think it's bigger than milwaukee now definitely not in the physical size either hi pretty sure Milwaukee's like twenty eighth biggest city in the United States it's just a very expensive place to live can we leave it at that yeah I agree with that when I visited it was very expensive alright let's hear as you didn't you didn't call me but what I didn't know you at that point alright let's hear these mutters all right let's break it down let's make it easy for you um there are really three things that you should look at if you are going into a fitness nutrition store of whatever a variety two proteins and then one other option and then anything else you can pretty much consider to be bunk unless you really have it on a reliable source from somebody you've seen who's like ripped big gains huge muscle dude right number one you want to get that whey protein my preference is to get whey protein isolate so definitely look for that on the label just not just regular whey protein you want whey protein isolate it tends to digest a little easier so if you have any kind of milk problem you might have less of it if you're only doing the isolate you take a whey protein before and after working out because whey protein digests quickly so you have it before you workout so when you're lifting your muscles will have that available to use while you're working out and then right after you're working out so that your muscles can use that as part of their recovery process the other type of protein you want to invest in is and everybody always says I pronounce this wrong it's a casino or case in CA se I n that is a fun protein that when you shake it up it kind of foams and it's a little bit gelatinous Oh yikes no no no it's it's still drinkable it's it's like it just eat it tends to be more like bubbles then then you would expect from mocha from powder type thing um it does not turn into a jelly no but it's but it's important to understand that because case in protein is slow digesting so if you do a scoop of casein protein it's probably going to take about eight hours for that to digest through your system so what you typically do is you take case in at bedtime and when you wake up in the morning and then you've got 16 hours covered of protein in your system that your body can use for recovery and repair like just throughout that time so you take it or you go to bed you wake up huh straight to the gym no no no no no you take those cases over you go to bed okay now now has I don't learn in gym all right case cason you just like you have a nice big glass of that like I would say half an hour before you're planning on going to bed and then of course because rest is a very important part of muscle recovery you're going to get eight hours of sleep every night right okay so that case in is digesting during those eight hours of sleep you wake up in the morning and then you have another scoop of case in so typically what I do is I mix the case in with milk and then I pour my coffee into it so it's like chocolate coffee kind of protein deal I've never on instead of that but that sounds good yeah and then that gives you eight hours through the day while you're at your office job and then when you leave work you go and have a whey protein do your workout have another whey protein wagon they have your dinner clang in the writing I usually I've never I've never done case in powder and I have never tried Eric Aasen I've never tried it and I'm I'm not sure that I would necessarily oh I thought it's been transformative for me i really i would actually choose cason over whey protein after you we have a big big jug of UMP that we both dip into and we use that I don't know what that is it's just whey protein it's like on amazon i have not noticed anything transformative it also yeah i'm assuming it's not now first you got to get me out there and i will like whip you're at and you go into shape I will whip yourself into should good so the third thing I say we're getting things in this store that you want to look at is if you have a little bit of difficulty especially at the end of the workday going into the gym you want to look at a pre-workout which tends to be a high caffeine and then a few other things into kind of warm you up and get you moving so you would take a pre-workout about half an hour before you plan on working out and it just kind of energizes you to actually go and do your work out and I mean it depends on how much caffeine actually functions on you if you're a heavy coffee drinker a pre workouts not going to do that much for you in the long run but I don't do pre workout I don't have any problems getting motivated to go to the gym so but the other the key thing oh good lord hahaha the key thing about your protein intake uh is if you have not been doing protein powder step up to it gradually because if you go from like a daily intake of let's say 80 grams of protein every day and boost that up to a hundred and 80 grams of protein a day you are going to have stomach distress for about a week and a half while your body learns that oh I have to digest more protein every day I definitely when i first started at the beginning of this year going to the gym i took on the suggestion from my wife and my dad who we were all three of us were going to the gym together um that i should take some whey protein and i did and i felt terrible because i took way too much it was it was like probably one of the most uncomfortable stomach yep awkwardness that I've felt in a long time and it always like in the dog haha um and which you should target you don't just like gulp down protein like it doesn't matter how much protein what you should do is really and I mean it's just this is equally as important right the three pillars of getting your body into shape number one actually doing exercise number two getting actual rest number three nutrition so take the time and figure out what weight you want to get to and then do my preference is one gram of protein per pound of body weight that you want to get to some people say like if you're trying to if you're trying to get up to a higher weight do a gram and a half of protein for the weight you want to get to and if you want to get to a lower weight than maybe a little less than 1 gram of protein per the weight but I think a good target for people to hit one gram of protein per the weight that you want to get to so if you want to be a hundred eighty-five pounds if you think that's the right ideal body mass index for your height then you want to get 185 grams of protein every day and that's a mix of both the powders and everything and like the chicken that you eat the tuna that you eat look at your labels see how much protein is in those you have to add it all together to make sure that you're not overdoing it or under doing it I'll just need 12 steaks and then I go to the gym and I just rip sick weights all night I call right when I eat I eat 15 eggs and I have done a show back angle it back there yeah and I go back to the gym and I clanging bang for another 20 to 30 hours plugin yep I can make this relevant for him because I eat a lot of apples and I always think of that episode of The Simpsons where Homer like ate the apple bars oh yeah like super ripped I like three apples every day that's amazing all right good to know uh one more email here is from AJ from Utah wrightson says dear Pokemon podcast big fan of the show I love listening you guys go off on tangents clanging and banging please I am curious if mythical season three is going to be a thing thanks for all the laughs hey Jay makes something or however SBJ pronounces it is fine pse styles port or eyes almost at Port illa torterra is awesome Thank You AJ season three of mythical will be a thing but we are not talking about dates or anything right now getting a lot of mythical emails recently I think people are getting the secret to everyone the itch so I I don't want to say something wrong I noticed that there are starting to be like knockoff knockoffs out there uh-oh I don't know if you notice Li noticed there's no they're just the other I'm just kidding D&D Pokemon podcasts that are now popping up look at this pioneering I mean I don't think mythical was a pioneer show I think they've existed come on man let me just let me just have a bit like cracks car have his moment let me just give you a compliment for once all right all right let's move on to our poke amount of the week and we'll wrap up the show will you want to read the move setter I will read the move set and you have to explain what it does alright alright so the Pokemon of the week this week is a lowland sandslash which i believe is an ice type if if my memory serves properly which i don't know why they didn't I seen / I steal well there you go so this is a lowland sam / with a life orb and if you recall the life orb is the one that takes a little bit of your life every turn but in exchange it increases the amount of attack for your attacking moves the ability is slush rush which is really hard for me to say and slush rush doubles speed in hail conditions so I guess you have to be in hail Travis actually wrote in to give us oh wait I'm sorry this is this is contributed by Gabe Brown from the from the slack community who is known as cool Gabe and has my favorite username in the entire slack community of cool Gabe so the move set is a nature adamant nature do your Eevee's 32 HP 252 attack 224 in speed and then your moves are icicle crash ironhead rockslide and protect and they say like a fine wine it pairs well with a lowland nine tails because a lowland nine tails will have the snow warning ability that causes hail so then slush rush will kick in and it will double the speed and it appears that this build is intended to be a sweeper so that basically means after you've kind of lowered your opponents down a little bit it comes in and cleans up but I understand that's how things work should be called a faulty leader the kilometer the house cleaner and the house winner name your sand / the house cleaner Travis says that slush rush doubles the speed inhale and alone 19 tells ability snow warning causes immediate hail so that is the reason for the pairing which what will said life as long as the nine tails is the slower right because if your it's your nine tails vs my giggle if and my giggle at the slower you're getting a sandstorm dude yeah and Gabe also mentioned earthquake isn't great for doubles because of things like taboo bulu so that is why earthquake is not on this move set which I think somebody asked to follow up in slack of why there was no earthquake so some trivia no other Pokemon is the same type combination as a lowland sand / and its pre evolution is the only ice steel Pokemon uh in the pokemon red and blue beta San slashes original name was Sam storm sandslash and its pre evolution share their category with rent at Redick aid Picchu and raichu they're all known as the mouse Pokemon though ranta and Radek aid have been called the rat pokemon before which i think we had this whole conversation when we did a low and ride you yup so yeah there you go is shiny is and I don't know what the lowland shiny is but regulars hand / while it's tan with brown spikes shiny sand / is more grayish brown with blood red spikes that would be my description blood red it's real rich dark red hood red dark red fifty percent male fifty percent female it can also get snow cloak as another durability yeah so there you go some some a lowland sand / so there you go you can hopefully use that for future teams now let's do some housecleaning real quick since our last episode before we go to pax ah can I just real quick before you go you go there yeah can I just break the news and share my heartbreak that mimic you is no longer in the plush store on Pokemon come Wow oh yeah I double check that too it ain't there that's rough sad right now I'm super sad right so you're saying I should sell mine on eBay at a huge profit they are for sale on eBay right now for 1299 oh nice but are they legit hey that's a good question are you sure they're not like some Chinese knockoff with it just lay there were document Pokemon Center image they were definitely knock off from the Mickey plush is being sold before the official Pokemon Center yeah ok said housecleaning this
