New Hotel cast I'm your host Steve on (0:32 - 0:38)

Gen Con I'm here with my mandated press (0:38 - 0:45)
pass for Pokemon company uh report uh (0:40 - 0:46)
the prize (0:45 - 0:49)
table was small and I'm assuming that (0:46 - 0:51)
might be because of Worlds but there (0:49 - 0:52)
wasn't a lot there and I did play Max (0:51 - 0:54)
raid battles again and I was with a (0:52 - 0:57)
bunch of kids who were super super (0:54 - 1:00)
excited to just be alive and to do (0:57 - 1:02)
things and the best part about that is (1:00 - 1:03)
we'd go around the table and the guy (1:02 - 1:05)
would just look at me and goes oh you're (1:03 - 1:07)
you I Know What You Did you're fine he (1:05 - 1:10)
was so focused on dealing with the kids (1:07 - 1:12)
you just look at me and I'm like I'm (1:10 - 1:13)
just doing my turn over here I can't (1:12 - 1:15)
actually make them attack because I've (1:13 - 1:17)
got his sui and lilligan up and the only (1:15 - 1:18)
energy I have attached is one which (1:17 - 1:21)
means I just get to draw six cards so (1:18 - 1:25)

okay so here's Today's Show (2:28 - 2:32)
um we're gonna talk about the Pokemon (2:31 - 2:34)
presents that happened on August 8th and (2:32 - 2:36)
then worlds happened and there was some (2:34 - 2:39)
news there not as much news obviously so (2:36 - 2:41)
we're gonna be talking about that we're (2:39 - 2:45)
recording this on August (2:41 - 2:48)
13th for you to (2:45 - 2:50)
an August 14th for me because I'm in the (2:48 - 2:53)
future you're in the future (2:50 - 2:56)
I did a lot of things this past week uh (2:53 - 2:59)
full disclosure Pokemon company paid for (2:56 - 3:02)
my hotel the hotel that's here that I'm (2:59 - 3:04)
sitting in now (3:02 - 3:05)
um they did not pay for my flight I paid (3:04 - 3:07)
for that (3:05 - 3:09)
um they gave me a bunch of gifts from (3:07 - 3:11)
the Pokemon Center (3:09 - 3:13)
uh I don't even know how to separate (3:11 - 3:15)
what I bought versus what they bought (3:13 - 3:16)
the whole point of this disclosure is (3:15 - 3:18)
just because I have to disclose this per (3:16 - 3:21)
FTC guidelines I have to tell you that (3:18 - 3:23)
they paid for my flight they also (3:21 - 3:25)
invited me to a lot of things and gave (3:23 - 3:27)
me access to a lot of things that a (3:25 - 3:29)
normal person wouldn't (3:27 - 3:30)
we don't have enough time to talk about (3:29 - 3:32)
that I will tell you though this company (3:30 - 3:35)
has made me wake up at 6am every morning (3:32 - 3:41)
to get on a bus to like go to do things (3:35 - 3:41)
um (3:41 - 3:45)
they really made me work for this hotel (3:41 - 3:47)
um that being said it was great and (3:45 - 3:49)
we'll probably do like another bonus (3:47 - 3:52)
podcast talking about I went to some (3:49 - 3:55)
Japanese tea uh the I got a very fancy (3:52 - 3:58)
bento box from like the oldest most (3:55 - 4:00)
famous Japanese company and I didn't eat (3:58 - 4:02)
and I felt that was very disrespectful (4:00 - 4:04)
but also a fish was looking at me when I (4:02 - 4:06)
opened that bento box and that destroyed (4:04 - 4:08)
my appetite uh because he still had eyes (4:06 - 4:10)
and it was looking right at me (4:08 - 4:12)
um I went to a couple Pokemon Centers (4:10 - 4:15)
before they opened to like see how they (4:12 - 4:18)
set it up I went to creatures the people (4:15 - 4:20)
who make the Pokemon Trading Card Game (4:18 - 4:22)
and made detective Pikachu I was there (4:20 - 4:25)
and we interviewed a lot of people there (4:22 - 4:27)
that was cool uh and then I did a (4:25 - 4:28)
million other things we're going to talk (4:27 - 4:31)
about none of that today uh (4:28 - 4:33)
We're not gonna talk about any of the (4:31 - 4:35)
cool things uh we're gonna cover this (4:33 - 4:37)
Pokemon presents because there's a lot (4:35 - 4:39)
here (4:37 - 4:39)
um (4:39 - 4:42)
and I'm just gonna go in order of what (4:39 - 4:45)
is on pokemon.com (4:42 - 4:48)
uh which is (4:45 - 4:51)
uh on August 8th the cheap offer (4:48 - 4:53)
Operating Officer of the Pokemon company (4:51 - 4:55)
hosted the Pokemon presents (4:53 - 4:57)
uh this included a bunch of games but (4:55 - 4:59)
they're starting off with Pokemon (4:57 - 5:01)
scarlet and Pokemon Violet fan favorite (4:59 - 5:04)
Pokemon are the star of the show during (5:01 - 5:08)
the get Mew and Mewtwo event you can (5:04 - 5:10)
bring the mythical Pokemon Mew to your (5:08 - 5:12)
team right now by entering the password (5:10 - 5:15)
get your Mew and Mystery Gift meanwhile (5:12 - 5:17)
Mewtwo will appear in the upcoming tarot (5:15 - 5:19)
Raid event and you will be able to (5:17 - 5:20)
defeat this Mewtwo for the mightiest (5:19 - 5:23)
Mark there will also be a special Terra (5:20 - 5:24)
Raid Battle (5:23 - 5:25)
[Music] (5:24 - 5:26)
um (5:25 - 5:27)
there will also be special tarot Raid (5:26 - 5:28)
Battle events that will help you (5:27 - 5:30)
challenge this legendary Pokemon which (5:28 - 5:31)
are happening (5:30 - 5:33)
I think that ended (5:31 - 5:35)
of this podcast but they were dropping (5:33 - 5:37)
like vitamins and (5:35 - 5:39)
um I think there are three rounds of it (5:37 - 5:40)
yes (5:39 - 5:41)
I don't know if they're going to be (5:40 - 5:43)
exactly the same though (5:41 - 5:49)
Fair because it didn't say I got my Mew (5:43 - 5:49)
um I did not get mine yet did you get (5:50 - 5:56)
good tarot type uh I got I got a little (5:52 - 5:58)
goth Mew little dark little dark Terror (5:56 - 6:00)
type (5:58 - 6:02)
all sad sad in the corner with Dark (6:00 - 6:04)
Pulse listen to Fall Out Boy wishing it (6:02 - 6:06)
had a chain wallet (6:04 - 6:08)
me too (6:06 - 6:08)
did you get your 30th gastrodon that (6:09 - 6:15)
they've distributed during World I'm (6:12 - 6:17)
done shoot is that over need any more (6:15 - 6:20)
gastronaut I don't get it (6:17 - 6:24)
I don't want it go away (6:20 - 6:27)
don't worry I think a senior won worlds (6:24 - 6:28)
and I think the only Pokemon that (6:27 - 6:30)
qualified on their team (6:28 - 6:34)
to be distributed disgust (6:30 - 6:34)
don't worry every time this is a sad (6:35 - 6:41)
meta this is a sad like he's just really (6:37 - 6:46)
good just a good ability (6:41 - 6:46)
um so yeah they announced uh Seven Star (6:47 - 6:55)
mute two the given everyone a Mew that's (6:51 - 6:56)
cool (6:55 - 6:59)
um you will be a random Terror type you (6:56 - 7:03)
can obviously change Muse Terror type (6:59 - 7:03)
um (7:03 - 7:08)
apparently that they've said that if you (7:04 - 7:10)
bring Mew against me too it will get (7:08 - 7:12)
something special will happen I think we (7:10 - 7:16)
know what's happening just based off (7:12 - 7:18)
people being like we figured it out (7:16 - 7:20)
which I think is Mew gets like a 20 (7:18 - 7:23)
attack boost and like a 50 HP boost (7:20 - 7:25)
something like that take that with a (7:23 - 7:27)
grain of salt obviously numbers things (7:25 - 7:29)
can change I think the thing that I want (7:27 - 7:31)
to point out that maybe people are (7:29 - 7:33)
forgetting (7:31 - 7:37)
is Pikachu was really different than the (7:33 - 7:40)
other Seven Star raids it started with a (7:37 - 7:43)
full shield uh it was holding a held (7:40 - 7:45)
item (7:43 - 7:48)
um we know just based off you know (7:45 - 7:51)
cerebi.net I almost said.com (7:48 - 7:54)
um oh that's a different one (7:51 - 7:58)
some raid bosses had more HP than other (7:54 - 8:02)
Seven Star raid bosses so I think (7:58 - 8:05)
people are maybe just underestimating (8:02 - 8:08)
this raid already of like oh just give (8:05 - 8:09)
me you nasty plot and just use Dark (8:08 - 8:11)
Pulse and maybe set up a light screen (8:09 - 8:14)
and it should be fine like maybe (8:11 - 8:16)
sure I like raids with coordination are (8:14 - 8:18)
a lot easier than raids with randoms we (8:16 - 8:20)
figured this out but (8:18 - 8:23)
who's to say that Mewtwo doesn't start (8:20 - 8:24)
with a shield (8:23 - 8:26)
have two Shields (8:24 - 8:28)
have five times the amount of Health (8:26 - 8:34)
like reset the stats have 20 moves (8:28 - 8:35)
um (8:34 - 8:36)
there was also a thing in sword and (8:35 - 8:38)
shield where there were different (8:36 - 8:40)
mewtwos (8:38 - 8:43)
um so again just saying maybe it's (8:40 - 8:46)
possible for there to be two or three (8:43 - 8:48)
different mewtwos and this Mewtwo (8:46 - 8:50)
happens to have Thunderbolt but this (8:48 - 8:51)
Mewtwo has blizzard but this Mewtwo has (8:50 - 8:54)
flamethrower that would give you a (8:51 - 8:58)
reason to okay my bug type Mew is (8:54 - 8:59)
very bad against the one that has (8:58 - 9:02)
flamethrower but good against the one (8:59 - 9:04)
that has Thunderbolt right don't know (9:02 - 9:07)
I'm just speculating I just maybe their (9:04 - 9:09)
first legendary Seven Star raid isn't (9:07 - 9:10)
gonna be as (9:09 - 9:13)
simple as (9:10 - 9:15)
I don't know who knows maybe you're not (9:13 - 9:18)
going to be able to solo it as he's lose (9:15 - 9:20)
some people are expecting look I'm (9:18 - 9:22)
excited to jump into randoms of all Muse (9:20 - 9:26)
just Muse across the board me me Mew (9:22 - 9:28)
don't worry I'm sure the annihilate (9:26 - 9:31)
players oh it's going to be three music (9:28 - 9:34)
or two Muse and annihilate but an iron (9:31 - 9:37)
hands (9:34 - 9:37)
yeah I have no clue how it's gonna work (9:37 - 9:44)
but it's cool that's (9:40 - 9:45)
Maybe (9:44 - 9:48)
more will come after this (9:45 - 9:51)
maybe a Shiny Rayquaza because the anime (9:48 - 9:54)
I don't know (9:51 - 9:56)
who knows (9:54 - 9:59)
uh more details revealed about the (9:56 - 10:03)
hidden area of zero treasure game that I (9:59 - 10:06)
put the words (10:03 - 10:06)
is this the first time we learned the (10:07 - 10:14)
names of the new legendaries (10:10 - 10:16)
no we knew their names (10:14 - 10:18)
did we uh okey-dokey monkey Dory (10:16 - 10:21)
pheasantippity (10:18 - 10:21)
I don't remember them before why are (10:21 - 10:25)
they all (10:23 - 10:28)
why we knew them for sure why are they (10:25 - 10:31)
all happiness related (10:28 - 10:33)
because they're the heroes either the (10:31 - 10:34)
heroes I know I just heard of sitting (10:33 - 10:36)
there I'm like so we have okay we have (10:34 - 10:39)
okie dokie hunky dory and serendipity (10:36 - 10:42)
mm-hmm (10:39 - 10:44)
unfortunately no doggy woggy no well (10:42 - 10:46)
ducky bike is not really used in popular (10:44 - 10:49)
culture (10:46 - 10:49)
we got a release date we have September (10:49 - 10:55)
13th (10:53 - 10:57)
who could argue is still summer I guess (10:55 - 11:00)
so maybe they're a little bit by what (10:57 - 11:02)
standard (11:00 - 11:02)
by the calendar yeah by the (11:02 - 11:09)
yes by the calendar and it's also it's (11:06 - 11:11)
called a month from when we're recording (11:09 - 11:14)
this so it's soon (11:11 - 11:17)
yeah it's one month uh so they also (11:14 - 11:18)
showed some new Pokemon they showed (11:17 - 11:23)
diplin which is the evolution of Aplin (11:18 - 11:26)
um and then they showed the blueberry (11:23 - 11:30)
Academy for the Indigo disc and that (11:26 - 11:33)
will have the BB League which I think BB (11:30 - 11:35)
just stands for blueberry (11:33 - 11:37)
um and there will be an elite four there (11:35 - 11:40)
I think we kind of all saw that coming I (11:37 - 11:42)
think when they showed four people in a (11:40 - 11:44)
stadium (11:42 - 11:46)
um I don't know why it doesn't say here (11:44 - 11:46)
but (11:46 - 11:48)
um in their own press release on their (11:46 - 11:49)
own website but they showed the (11:48 - 11:51)
deralidon evolution (11:49 - 11:53)
yeah (11:51 - 11:56)
which is a thing (11:53 - 11:58)
makes drawled on so much better for me I (11:56 - 12:01)
never really liked to draw it on I (11:58 - 12:02)
didn't think it stood up as a single (12:01 - 12:06)
stage Pokemon just visually I like its (12:02 - 12:07)
evolution (12:06 - 12:09)
enough yeah (12:07 - 12:11)
why it's not at this press release on (12:09 - 12:12)
their own website but I can't remember (12:11 - 12:14)
its name (12:12 - 12:18)
because it's an arch bridge and the (12:14 - 12:21)
artwork is better than the in-game model (12:18 - 12:23)
oh (12:21 - 12:26)
um okay I'm sorry in game it looks like (12:23 - 12:29)
a stapler remover okay it looks like (12:26 - 12:31)
there's no lies detected (12:29 - 12:34)
also I'm into that too though I I am not (12:31 - 12:37)
I don't I don't I don't I don't like it (12:34 - 12:39)
I don't like it but the bigger question (12:37 - 12:43)
is is the is the evolution coming to (12:39 - 12:45)
unite (12:43 - 12:47)
because I was trying to think great (12:45 - 12:48)
question if this is the first one that's (12:47 - 12:50)
gotten an evolution that's already in (12:48 - 12:53)
unite that gets an evolution (12:50 - 12:56)
that has had an evolution ad after that (12:53 - 12:59)
game came out because like it is still (12:56 - 13:02)
weird that Pikachu doesn't evolve uh (12:59 - 13:03)
fine and now that they've added it (13:02 - 13:05)
doesn't make sense I know that they've (13:03 - 13:08)
added Mega's should lucaria Mega Evolve (13:05 - 13:09)
the same way like their questions but (13:08 - 13:11)
this is one that actually caught an (13:09 - 13:13)
evolution that's in the game it was like (13:11 - 13:16)
it's a good question do we get us do we (13:13 - 13:18)
get a stapler remover in unite gosh I (13:16 - 13:20)
hope not (13:18 - 13:23)
I would argue I hope so (13:20 - 13:26)
I hope so but I think not (13:23 - 13:30)
I don't know they gave like Scyther a (13:26 - 13:32)
split (13:30 - 13:35)
Clefairy doesn't need to evolve right no (13:32 - 13:37)
Clefairy does I think Larry is a forest (13:35 - 13:38)
evolved I think the other one that does (13:37 - 13:40)
the split evolve right now is Scyther (13:38 - 13:42)
there's probably one that I'm forgetting (13:40 - 13:44)
because I don't play it well splits (13:42 - 13:45)
Hershey food split (13:44 - 13:48)
Scyther is just straight up not evolve (13:45 - 13:50)
yeah well you can either ghost either or (13:48 - 13:53)
not evolve and say Scyther and it's a (13:50 - 13:54)
split evolution (13:53 - 13:56)
got it (13:54 - 14:01)
but what about clever yeah exactly (13:56 - 14:01)
that that's you gotta pay the 500 gems (14:01 - 14:05)
actually yeah (14:04 - 14:08)
look we're getting some top tier unite (14:05 - 14:11)
talent coming so we're fine the second (14:08 - 14:15)
half second can I do a side note yeah (14:11 - 14:17)
side note here (14:15 - 14:20)
there's there's a lot of people that (14:17 - 14:22)
they really need to go to the gym (14:20 - 14:25)
because their stretching is impressive (14:22 - 14:27)
but (14:25 - 14:29)
it's too much stretching (14:27 - 14:33)
just never too much stretching because a (14:29 - 14:36)
Pokemon is based on a bridge I'm (14:33 - 14:37)
whispering I'm in a hotel room right now (14:36 - 14:40)
I'm gonna get angry it doesn't (14:37 - 14:41)
okay (14:40 - 14:45)
the connection of like Unova confirmed (14:41 - 14:48)
because duraladon a gen 8 Pokemon (14:45 - 14:52)
evolves into a bridge is the most crazy (14:48 - 14:56)
mental gymnastics I've ever seen like (14:52 - 14:59)
okay there's a bridge in every Pokemon (14:56 - 15:02)
oh there's multiple Bridges list them (14:59 - 15:07)
list all the bridges right now (15:02 - 15:07)
I'm tired to spend an hour talking about (15:09 - 15:15)
bridges in Pokemon game but you better (15:13 - 15:17)
believe I can (15:15 - 15:20)
the only bridge that is at all (15:17 - 15:23)
meaningful is unova's Bridge because you (15:20 - 15:27)
have to walk over it for a cutscene (15:23 - 15:27)
there's definitely not lowering bridges (15:29 - 15:35)
in any other games ever and there's (15:32 - 15:37)
definitely not cutscenes on any of the (15:35 - 15:40)
other Bridges there are not if that is a (15:37 - 15:43)
Berenstain Bears thing right there (15:40 - 15:45)
there's just (15:43 - 15:47)
what I think you know but I've always (15:45 - 15:50)
thought Bridges (15:47 - 15:53)
ah the most famous bridges in the world (15:50 - 15:56)
are only in New York nobody else has a (15:53 - 15:58)
famous bridge (15:56 - 15:58)
any other country only New York has a (16:01 - 16:10)
famous bridge (16:07 - 16:10)
holy cow (16:12 - 16:17)
we're the only one okay only the (16:14 - 16:19)
Brooklyn Bridge that's it there's one (16:17 - 16:20)
Bridge built in the world that it was in (16:19 - 16:22)
Brooklyn (16:20 - 16:25)
just one Bridge (16:22 - 16:26)
um (16:25 - 16:30)
two other Pokemon they showed uh (16:26 - 16:33)
ryko he has a long neck I don't know (16:30 - 16:35)
what else there is to say boy dragon (16:33 - 16:39)
type I'm out I am out I love it I don't (16:35 - 16:41)
love it it's it's it's good I don't love (16:39 - 16:45)
it but it's good diplin is adorable I (16:41 - 16:46)
love diplin (16:45 - 16:52)
stapler remover nah uh uh long neck heck (16:46 - 16:54)
heck no because it's better in the (16:52 - 16:58)
official art than it does in game (16:54 - 16:58)
when it's in battle you can't see its (16:59 - 17:07)
head It's Too Tall I'm into this (17:04 - 17:09)
no (17:07 - 17:12)
I'm I'm still on the fence about iron (17:09 - 17:15)
crown (17:12 - 17:15)
that's the cobalian thing yeah it's a (17:15 - 17:19)
pretty good name honestly (17:17 - 17:22)
I mean it's it's kind of I (17:19 - 17:26)
yeah it's okay but no raging bolt be (17:22 - 17:27)
gone get get (17:26 - 17:29)
the (17:27 - 17:31)
so I'm assuming for (17:29 - 17:34)
go ahead I still don't like how they're (17:31 - 17:35)
doing this with the legendary beasts (17:34 - 17:38)
because they have their origin story (17:35 - 17:40)
already that seems very unrelated so I'm (17:38 - 17:43)
hoping they're not actually related but (17:40 - 17:46)
I'm satisfied with how goofy this one (17:43 - 17:48)
looks with how silly this one looks (17:46 - 17:51)
so I'm assuming teal mask will give us (17:48 - 17:54)
Entei and yeah (17:51 - 17:57)
turakian yeah yeah (17:54 - 18:00)
so cool like (17:57 - 18:03)
something to look forward to I guess (18:00 - 18:06)
aldeo (18:03 - 18:06)
um (18:08 - 18:14)
was it really a fourth surfing Pony (18:10 - 18:17)
yeah maybe they'll maybe chaldeo will be (18:14 - 18:20)
in both both future and past because (18:17 - 18:22)
that's how powerful oh yeah (18:20 - 18:25)
also tell the YouTube comments (18:22 - 18:28)
we forgot about Volcarona last week or (18:25 - 18:31)
the week before sorry to iron moth and (18:28 - 18:33)
Slither Wings how could we (18:31 - 18:35)
look it was Greg wasn't here was that (18:33 - 18:37)
was that the Greg episode we can blame (18:35 - 18:39)
Bobby yeah it's always Bobby's fault (18:37 - 18:42)
yeah okay (18:39 - 18:42)
um (18:43 - 18:46)
I think this is the better (18:48 - 18:53)
I think this was a decent trailer I know (18:51 - 18:56)
like I feel like overall the (18:53 - 18:59)
I don't know the like reception or the (18:56 - 19:00)
feeling of the presents where like (18:59 - 19:02)
people weren't super impressed with it (19:00 - 19:04)
and maybe that was so top loaded with (19:02 - 19:06)
non-main series stuff but like that's (19:04 - 19:08)
what every person is now is like we have (19:06 - 19:10)
to touch on unite we have to touch on (19:08 - 19:12)
Masters we have to touch on Pokemon go (19:10 - 19:14)
so it's like (19:12 - 19:17)
kind of whatever I I expect at least but (19:14 - 19:20)
DLC wise (19:17 - 19:23)
I feel like I am now a little more (19:20 - 19:26)
excited versus the other ones of like (19:23 - 19:29)
I don't know how this is gonna go I I (19:26 - 19:34)
feel I I was I feel more connected to (19:29 - 19:37)
the the story after these trailers that (19:34 - 19:41)
I felt in the other ones like I actually (19:37 - 19:43)
felt like oh they're they're doing (19:41 - 19:45)
something and then it is also helpful (19:43 - 19:47)
that they said you'll return to area (19:45 - 19:51)
zero after because I'm like are you ever (19:47 - 19:53)
gonna answer some of these questions so (19:51 - 19:55)
it was very helpful in the second DLC (19:53 - 19:57)
yeah the second DSA you will go back to (19:55 - 19:59)
here if we're gonna do something because (19:57 - 20:01)
you have to finish the main story before (19:59 - 20:03)
you can do the second DLC you don't have (20:01 - 20:04)
to finish the main story before you can (20:03 - 20:07)
do the first DLC the first DLC is going (20:04 - 20:08)
to be kind of a side story that is (20:07 - 20:10)
related (20:08 - 20:12)
as far as we can tell but I'm super (20:10 - 20:14)
excited for the second DLC and there is (20:12 - 20:17)
a character who has Tara Crystal (20:14 - 20:20)
earrings but also who has the symbols on (20:17 - 20:22)
her clothing are the same symbols that (20:20 - 20:24)
are around the scarlet and violet logos (20:22 - 20:25)
on the boxes and we don't know what they (20:24 - 20:27)
mean yet and they match all of the other (20:25 - 20:29)
random symbols throughout the game and I (20:27 - 20:30)
just want to learn more about what's (20:29 - 20:32)
going on yeah don't get your hopes up (20:30 - 20:35)
but yeah (20:32 - 20:35)
there's something I swear (20:35 - 20:41)
um I liked how the blueberry leagues (20:40 - 20:42)
looks (20:41 - 20:43)
like (20:42 - 20:48)
I I really enjoyed the designs (20:43 - 20:51)
um I thought that they I think his (20:48 - 20:53)
seeing characters the only thing that (20:51 - 20:55)
makes me mad I guess it could make me (20:53 - 20:57)
mad though they have all these great (20:55 - 20:59)
outfits and I'm still stuck in this (20:57 - 21:03)
hideous school uniform and I hate it (20:59 - 21:05)
don't worry I have a bridge Pokemon now (21:03 - 21:08)
I have a stapler remover can I remove my (21:05 - 21:09)
clothing (21:08 - 21:12)
no (21:09 - 21:12)
and there's gonna be photography we get (21:13 - 21:18)
a selfie stick that sold me right there (21:16 - 21:20)
selfie stick (21:18 - 21:24)
the problem okay when they were like you (21:20 - 21:27)
get a wide angle stick it's like that's (21:24 - 21:31)
not the problem the problems the angles (21:27 - 21:33)
are not the problem the problem is the (21:31 - 21:35)
Pokemon runs in a circle around you and (21:33 - 21:39)
it stops inside your body and you can't (21:35 - 21:41)
see it like I don't need a wider stick I (21:39 - 21:44)
need to be able to be like (21:41 - 21:44)
with the new photography thing you can (21:46 - 21:50)
force them to stop and see it (21:48 - 21:53)
I thought I heard that somewhere (21:50 - 21:56)
I heard that I didn't see that in the (21:53 - 21:58)
trailer but I didn't see the trailer but (21:56 - 22:00)
I read it somewhere and I want to say it (21:58 - 22:02)
was something more official because who (22:00 - 22:04)
the heck knows what I was doing (22:02 - 22:06)
I could be it could be wrong but (22:04 - 22:10)
hopefully yes that is a thing (22:06 - 22:10)
uh another really cool thing that they (22:11 - 22:14)
showed (22:13 - 22:18)
um were the I think they were Moshi or (22:14 - 22:21)
the Mochi yeah yeah so you can use that (22:18 - 22:23)
to reset stats and stuff that seems (22:21 - 22:25)
really cool that seems more permanent (22:23 - 22:28)
than (22:25 - 22:30)
lady clear I think that was actually her (22:28 - 22:32)
official name was like lady clear who (22:30 - 22:34)
was on the Isle of armor literally on a (22:32 - 22:36)
little island in the middle of nowhere (22:34 - 22:37)
you like swim out to her she'd charge (22:36 - 22:39)
you like 10 armor right ore or something (22:37 - 22:42)
to reset all the stats (22:39 - 22:44)
um which kind of sucks because sometimes (22:42 - 22:45)
you don't need to reset all the stats (22:44 - 22:48)
like it was better than like slime and (22:45 - 22:51)
berries in your Pokemon's mouth but like (22:48 - 22:53)
sometimes you want to keep all HP but (22:51 - 22:56)
only reset like speed and then move it (22:53 - 22:58)
into attack and it's like ah like (22:56 - 23:00)
I have to redo HP again and that's (22:58 - 23:04)
expensive so this was really exciting (23:00 - 23:05)
for me and I think it was really (23:04 - 23:07)
exciting for competitive people because (23:05 - 23:11)
it does seem like mints (23:07 - 23:15)
slash berries like a something that will (23:11 - 23:17)
possibly hopefully fingers crossed (23:15 - 23:21)
continue into future Pokemon games verse (23:17 - 23:23)
I don't know some random NPC that will (23:21 - 23:25)
just wipe your stats with some random (23:23 - 23:27)
currency that just happens as it exists (23:25 - 23:29)
in this game but I don't know who knows (23:27 - 23:32)
this company can't make a bag to save (23:29 - 23:35)
their life and they were eight million (23:32 - 23:38)
items scrolling and why certain items (23:35 - 23:40)
are not in certain pouches is (23:38 - 23:43)
Beyond me but yeah let's add another (23:40 - 23:45)
like six I don't know how many emotions (23:43 - 23:48)
there are six seven eight I don't know I (23:45 - 23:49)
would assume there's one for all stats (23:48 - 23:52)
and then one for individual stats yeah (23:49 - 23:55)
uh oh and Ms Breyer is the person you're (23:52 - 23:58)
referring to that has the earrings Nava (23:55 - 24:00)
symbols on (23:58 - 24:03)
she's wearing a purple top and a Scarlet (24:00 - 24:06)
bottom like yeah absolute Elegance this (24:03 - 24:10)
is an iconic person what she's doing in (24:06 - 24:11)
this school (24:10 - 24:14)
services are better used elsewhere I (24:11 - 24:16)
think you want the Violet top and a (24:14 - 24:18)
Scarlet bottom yeah (24:16 - 24:21)
is it a black and blue dress or a (24:18 - 24:26)
golden white dress it's golden White (24:21 - 24:28)
was it was that the two color I don't (24:26 - 24:31)
remember yeah it was it was yes (24:28 - 24:31)
that yeah we won't get too far into that (24:32 - 24:37)
because that ended sadly (24:35 - 24:40)
uh I told myself I would keep this show (24:37 - 24:43)
as short as possible because it's almost (24:40 - 24:46)
it's 1am for me uh crime rants back I'm (24:43 - 24:48)
very excited uh we need to move on your (24:46 - 24:52)
wishes I'm still left in the cold (24:48 - 24:52)
is the little one too that's the other (24:52 - 24:56)
thing (24:55 - 24:58)
tropicos has its two forms it's the same (24:56 - 25:00)
Pokemon it's not a different Pokemon (24:58 - 25:02)
it's not a Diancie and carbine situation (25:00 - 25:03)
it's (25:02 - 25:07)
possibly seemingly a terraform (25:03 - 25:09)
that it just looks different when it (25:07 - 25:11)
terrestalizes which ogrepon also (25:09 - 25:13)
apparently does (25:11 - 25:15)
but the inner tent told me that Cycles (25:13 - 25:18)
are was going to evolve into Corydon and (25:15 - 25:19)
ride on (25:18 - 25:24)
and technically they do no they don't (25:19 - 25:26)
they don't technically when's the future (25:24 - 25:28)
there's no Evolution go three thousand (25:26 - 25:30)
things (25:28 - 25:30)
and if you go way into the past it (25:31 - 25:36)
changed I got a bridge in Unova to sell (25:33 - 25:38)
you both right now (25:36 - 25:40)
I mean that is it look better than a (25:38 - 25:44)
staple remover because that I'm in (25:40 - 25:44)
No Deal take it or leave it nah nah (25:45 - 25:52)
uh detective Pikachu Returns the Great (25:50 - 25:53)
Adventures of detective Pikachu continue (25:52 - 25:56)
in this upcoming title detective Pikachu (25:53 - 25:58)
and his partner Tim joined forces to (25:56 - 26:00)
solve the mystery of Tim's missing (25:58 - 26:02)
father I've been told that the car crash (26:00 - 26:04)
does happen in the game it also happens (26:02 - 26:07)
in the movie the presentation introduces (26:04 - 26:09)
some of the people and Pokemon of our (26:07 - 26:11)
Valiant Heroes meet during their (26:09 - 26:12)
investigation (26:11 - 26:15)
they showed that you could like (26:12 - 26:16)
what was that looked older in this one (26:15 - 26:18)
is Tim's older in this one he looked the (26:16 - 26:21)
model looked older to me it just (26:18 - 26:25)
detected Pikachu so time has passed (26:21 - 26:30)
yes also I think the love interest has (26:25 - 26:31)
new hair (26:30 - 26:33)
yeah (26:31 - 26:37)
um and Pikachu can ride a grow with (26:33 - 26:40)
that's about all they show the dream (26:37 - 26:42)
that's the dream (26:40 - 26:44)
there's a failing so that was cool I (26:42 - 26:46)
guess (26:44 - 26:48)
foreign (26:46 - 26:48)
I'm excited for this game but I I I feel (26:49 - 26:54)
like I can read the room I feel like I (26:53 - 26:57)
got a pretty good temperature that the (26:54 - 27:00)
average Pokemon fan doesn't seem to care (26:57 - 27:02)
about this like you could easily look at (27:00 - 27:03)
another spin-off game like new Pokemon (27:02 - 27:06)
Snap and universally it seemed like (27:03 - 27:07)
everyone was pretty hot on that like (27:06 - 27:10)
everyone was pretty excited (27:08 - 27:12)
um obviously you have Pokemon fans that (27:10 - 27:14)
are very TCG focused or maybe very video (27:12 - 27:17)
game focused or main Series game focused (27:14 - 27:20)
um or very go focused and then you do (27:17 - 27:21)
have these spin-offs that kind of hit (27:20 - 27:23)
everyone where they're like (27:21 - 27:25)
Pokemon Stadium Pokemon Snap that kind (27:23 - 27:28)
of stuff ah you know the first detective (27:25 - 27:30)
Pikachu didn't do (27:28 - 27:33)
numbers you know again with like (27:30 - 27:37)
that and I I I think the only thing I (27:33 - 27:39)
could really say is like (27:37 - 27:41)
this game should have came out closer to (27:39 - 27:42)
the movie (27:41 - 27:45)
like yeah I I don't know what the (27:42 - 27:47)
technical issues were or or what (27:45 - 27:49)
happened but I mean I'm glad it's coming (27:47 - 27:52)
out but it just kind of feels (27:49 - 27:56)
real awkward right now it feels like it (27:52 - 27:59)
missed its moment and showing up to the (27:56 - 28:04)
party way too late but I mean (27:59 - 28:04)
is coming between (28:04 - 28:11)
the two DLCs which I think is probably (28:07 - 28:13)
the best time (28:11 - 28:15)
they could have released it because they (28:13 - 28:17)
will probably get (28:15 - 28:20)
some hype from people to who are excited (28:17 - 28:23)
by the DLCs who still want to do some (28:20 - 28:26)
Pokemon stuff are out of the first DLC (28:23 - 28:28)
and waiting for the second and then this (28:26 - 28:30)
one slots in and it doesn't take a lot (28:28 - 28:33)
from them I think (28:30 - 28:35)
it will probably still do well because (28:33 - 28:38)
they were pretty smart about when (28:35 - 28:41)
they're releasing it (28:38 - 28:41)
if (28:41 - 28:45)
they can get Niantic um well I mean I (28:43 - 28:47)
guess they just tell Niantic what to do (28:45 - 28:49)
right they're the Pokemon just tell them (28:47 - 28:52)
to do it (28:49 - 28:54)
until Niantic to do a (28:52 - 28:57)
you here's a Pikachu with a detective (28:54 - 29:00)
cap in the game for this weekend and I (28:57 - 29:02)
don't know maybe if it's like (29:00 - 29:04)
scarlet and violet read your save data (29:02 - 29:07)
for detective Pikachu you get (29:04 - 29:09)
a Growlithe that you can write I'm like (29:07 - 29:12)
you know you get a Pokemon right or you (29:09 - 29:15)
get an outfit uh that would be nice I (29:12 - 29:18)
think those things do slightly move the (29:15 - 29:19)
needle (29:18 - 29:21)
um that kind of stuff for people oh yeah (29:19 - 29:23)
if you're able to remind Pokemon go (29:21 - 29:25)
players who don't pay attention to most (29:23 - 29:27)
of the rest of Pokemon stuff that (29:25 - 29:29)
detective Pikachu exists and say oh hey (29:27 - 29:31)
there's this cool detective Pikachu game (29:29 - 29:32)
that just came out (29:31 - 29:34)
just by having a Pikachu with a (29:32 - 29:36)
detective hat in game (29:34 - 29:40)
I think that would be a plus yeah (29:36 - 29:40)
there's I did you guys know there's a (29:42 - 29:46)
brand new Pokemon anime coming called (29:44 - 29:50)
Pokemon Y since the series it will (29:46 - 29:52)
follow the adventures of liko a girl (29:50 - 29:54)
with a mysterious pendant and Roy a boy (29:52 - 29:57)
with an equally mysterious Pokeball (29:54 - 30:00)
where's Ash (29:57 - 30:04)
well I think Ash is liko's Dad oh we're (30:00 - 30:07)
jumping into the future okay I'm I'm in (30:04 - 30:10)
as long as nothing happens to Ash and (30:07 - 30:12)
Ash doesn't leave the series in any way (30:10 - 30:15)
shape or form then I think I'll be into (30:12 - 30:16)
this new series (30:15 - 30:23)
[Laughter] (30:16 - 30:23)
they said coming soon yeah (30:25 - 30:30)
I mean it's the new Netflix thing (30:29 - 30:33)
supposed to hit like September is that (30:30 - 30:35)
when the next thing hits did I read that (30:33 - 30:38)
somewhere they'll like ask goodbye yeah (30:35 - 30:39)
ask goodbye is like September 8th or (30:38 - 30:40)
something (30:39 - 30:42)
yeah yeah yeah (30:40 - 30:43)
I mean (30:42 - 30:47)
Ash isn't leaving but sure (30:43 - 30:47)
I'm good I'm gonna be a 90 year old man (30:48 - 30:53)
before the Pokemon Horizons comes to the (30:50 - 30:54)
U.S (30:53 - 30:56)
she like what (30:54 - 30:58)
like this is probably the worst part of (30:56 - 31:00)
the presents because like we knew about (30:58 - 31:02)
it you didn't really show anything new (31:00 - 31:05)
and you didn't give us a release date (31:02 - 31:07)
like why even bother bringing it up You (31:05 - 31:09)
released a clip on YouTube showing that (31:07 - 31:11)
the translation is (31:09 - 31:14)
at least mostly done enough that you can (31:11 - 31:17)
show a clip from the first episode (31:14 - 31:20)
enough for the first 10 minutes (31:17 - 31:20)
we got a different anime with a really (31:21 - 31:27)
State announcement yeah (31:24 - 31:29)
oh did you watch the new (31:27 - 31:31)
uh card game anime did you watch the (31:29 - 31:33)
first episode on YouTube (31:31 - 31:36)
I did not I they the okay so the Pokemon (31:33 - 31:38)
company invited me to a lot of events (31:36 - 31:41)
this weekend uh one was a screening of (31:38 - 31:44)
the TCG anime and it was four episodes (31:41 - 31:47)
uh I don't know I don't know how long (31:44 - 31:49)
each episode is I was just told it was (31:47 - 31:52)
four I'm saying I was told it was four (31:49 - 31:54)
because I skipped that event (31:52 - 31:57)
uh they invited me to a lot of different (31:54 - 31:59)
things that was the one thing I skipped (31:57 - 32:01)
was that (31:59 - 32:04)
uh because my logic was the same logic (32:01 - 32:05)
for London (32:04 - 32:08)
why would I sit in a room and watch an (32:05 - 32:09)
hour plus show (32:08 - 32:12)
when I'm in a different country and I (32:09 - 32:14)
can watch that show (32:12 - 32:17)
on a plane or on my couch (32:14 - 32:19)
when I'm not in a different country yeah (32:17 - 32:22)
I mean the first episode was 10 minutes (32:19 - 32:24)
so I think the first four would have (32:22 - 32:25)
been 40 minutes I think they're going to (32:24 - 32:28)
be about 10 minutes each it was super (32:25 - 32:32)
cute like it was really enjoyable really (32:28 - 32:35)
the animation style is cute like (32:32 - 32:37)
it (32:35 - 32:39)
it's fun like it's not groundbreaking (32:37 - 32:41)
but it's fun (32:39 - 32:44)
okay well Pokemon paldayin wins is not (32:41 - 32:45)
that anime (32:44 - 32:48)
this is an original animated (32:45 - 32:52)
series set in the paldaya region it will (32:48 - 32:54)
follow several Academy students as they (32:52 - 32:55)
come to their own growing and learning (32:54 - 32:56)
as they attend school be sure to check (32:55 - 32:58)
out the full trailer that will premiere (32:56 - 33:00)
on September 6th (32:58 - 33:02)
um (33:00 - 33:02)
so they're just (33:02 - 33:05)
what was the other one called path to (33:06 - 33:10)
the peak path to the peak (33:08 - 33:12)
paldayin wins (33:10 - 33:16)
Pokemon Horizons none of these have Ash (33:12 - 33:18)
no (33:16 - 33:21)
there's no movie still I guess we've (33:18 - 33:25)
given up on Pokemon movies well they (33:21 - 33:27)
should (33:25 - 33:30)
the the movies (33:27 - 33:33)
it's been long enough here's here's a (33:30 - 33:35)
spoiler of the zarude movie (33:33 - 33:38)
the bad guy in the zarude movie (33:35 - 33:40)
runs (33:38 - 33:44)
Coco's parents off the road and they die (33:40 - 33:48)
it's an actual like (33:44 - 33:52)
bad guy thing like people die from (33:48 - 33:54)
another like that's that's how you end (33:52 - 33:57)
your movie series like we just committed (33:54 - 34:00)
a crime like we should literally be in (33:57 - 34:03)
prison yeah it's not like I'm just (34:00 - 34:05)
trying to steal some Pokemon which is (34:03 - 34:08)
also bad but he he he he (34:05 - 34:12)
drove a person off the road into a fiery (34:08 - 34:16)
crash they perished they're gone (34:12 - 34:19)
like a very dark movie (34:16 - 34:19)
the (34:19 - 34:23)
Pokemon movie after that (34:20 - 34:26)
they definitely made the Arceus one was (34:23 - 34:28)
kind of a pseudo movie (34:26 - 34:33)
oh yeah he he he yeah yeah (34:28 - 34:38)
he was 90 minutes of something yeah (34:33 - 34:40)
they're like No One's Gonna watch this (34:38 - 34:43)
quick put Cynthia in it (34:40 - 34:47)
and Cynthia sells tickets for sure (34:43 - 34:48)
that's true (34:47 - 34:49)
that's true (34:48 - 34:51)
um (34:49 - 34:52)
they talked about the World (34:51 - 34:55)
Championships uh which they introduced a (34:52 - 34:56)
new card (34:55 - 34:58)
um so normally the World Championships (34:56 - 34:59)
would have well they've gone through (34:58 - 35:00)
some other cards the card that's (34:59 - 35:02)
probably the most well known is a card (35:00 - 35:04)
called tropical beach they've had (35:02 - 35:06)
different variations of tropical beach (35:04 - 35:07)
by that I mean the art is different (35:06 - 35:10)
usually the card does the same thing (35:07 - 35:12)
um this card (35:10 - 35:17)
is called Paradise Resort and it says (35:12 - 35:20)
not making this up I promise The Retreat (35:17 - 35:22)
cost of (35:20 - 35:25)
The Retreat cost of each Psyduck in play (35:22 - 35:29)
both yours or your opponents is one (35:25 - 35:33)
the energy less (35:29 - 35:38)
it's so specific it's super specific (35:33 - 35:41)
and unless there's like a Psyduck GX (35:38 - 35:44)
coming out anytime soon I don't (35:41 - 35:48)
No Ex sorry (35:44 - 35:48)
why (35:51 - 35:56)
a Psyduck like is the I (35:53 - 35:59)
like card game is this a (35:56 - 36:01)
thing (35:59 - 36:05)
is this like a Psyduck stress that I've (36:01 - 36:08)
just completely unaware of (36:05 - 36:10)
I I don't know I don't I don't (36:08 - 36:13)
understand this card (36:10 - 36:15)
just because Psyduck (36:13 - 36:18)
yeah I mean Psyduck isn't even on the (36:15 - 36:20)
card (36:18 - 36:20)
is the smallest Pokemon in the card okay (36:20 - 36:25)
where he's he's right under the rainbow (36:23 - 36:29)
yeah I see it okay I see it now (36:25 - 36:29)
I I don't know (36:31 - 36:34)
it's it's a card Mouse holds watching (36:35 - 36:39)
like we look we don't want any part of (36:37 - 36:41)
this just (36:39 - 36:44)
move on everybody me too (36:41 - 36:46)
um path to the peak we just kind of (36:44 - 36:48)
talked about that uh Andy Goose ghosts (36:46 - 36:50)
of the Pokemon company introduced a new (36:48 - 36:52)
short animated series (36:50 - 36:54)
um that will Premiere in 2023 uh Pokemon (36:52 - 36:56)
path to the peak tells the story of Ava (36:54 - 36:58)
who strives to enter the world of (36:56 - 37:01)
competitive Pokemon Trading Card Game (36:58 - 37:02)
[Music] (37:01 - 37:02)
um (37:02 - 37:04)
she works with her friends family (37:02 - 37:06)
partner Pokemon Oddish to rise at the (37:04 - 37:08)
top the first episode will be released (37:06 - 37:12)
on YouTube on August 11th (37:08 - 37:12)
I've only heard good things about it so (37:14 - 37:20)
it has a very (37:16 - 37:24)
Disney Pixar look to it (37:20 - 37:24)
um so that's cool (37:25 - 37:29)
I'm sure I'm I'm sure that style isn't (37:27 - 37:32)
right that Style's always been in I (37:29 - 37:35)
guess so yeah I mean it (37:32 - 37:37)
we're kind of moving away from the (37:35 - 37:41)
Gravity Falls a big that sort of art (37:37 - 37:44)
style and transitioning into sort of the (37:41 - 37:47)
pixari Style again (37:44 - 37:48)
um so it's kind of I watch it it's kind (37:47 - 37:50)
of a (37:48 - 37:54)
it's kind of a weird CGI feel blend but (37:50 - 37:56)
for the story that they're telling and (37:54 - 37:58)
how they're telling it like it works (37:56 - 38:01)
really well like I felt like oh this is (37:58 - 38:04)
actually really nice to watch it is (38:01 - 38:07)
enjoyable the art style and the world (38:04 - 38:08)
that they've built are really great (38:07 - 38:11)
everybody feels everybody feels cohesive (38:08 - 38:14)
and uniquely different so like I you (38:11 - 38:15)
know for a 10 minute sin I'm like this (38:14 - 38:18)
is super cute like it's a really basic (38:15 - 38:20)
story but like it is (38:18 - 38:24)
quick and fun and cute and they have (38:20 - 38:26)
plenty of room to sort of launch from (38:24 - 38:28)
where they started so like just give it (38:26 - 38:32)
a shot it's 10 minutes it's cute (38:28 - 38:32)
I'll wait till they're all on YouTube (38:32 - 38:35)
and then I'll promptly forget that yeah (38:34 - 38:37)
did you ever watch have you watched a (38:35 - 38:40)
sui in snow yeah (38:37 - 38:40)
it's really good yeah it's on my team (38:44 - 38:51)
it's on my to-do list (38:48 - 38:51)
uh Pokemon Trading Card Game and Pokemon (38:51 - 38:58)
Stadium two (38:55 - 39:03)
are now on Nintendo switch online yep (38:58 - 39:05)
uh (39:03 - 39:08)
Pokemon Stadium 2 does just like Pokemon (39:05 - 39:09)
Stadium one (39:08 - 39:12)
does not have a Game Boy Player so (39:09 - 39:14)
there's a giant Game Boy in that Stadium (39:12 - 39:16)
where you could play your game boy game (39:14 - 39:20)
and that doesn't work it's a lot of fun (39:16 - 39:21)
mini games though (39:20 - 39:23)
true (39:21 - 39:27)
uh if you have never played the Pokemon (39:23 - 39:29)
Trading Card Game (39:27 - 39:31)
it's pretty (39:29 - 39:35)
I wouldn't say easy uh but it is maybe (39:31 - 39:37)
this is nostalgia in me I think it still (39:35 - 39:41)
holds up honestly and it's it's good (39:37 - 39:44)
banging music probably some of the best (39:41 - 39:47)
music in any Pokemon game so I don't (39:44 - 39:49)
know I think it's kind of I think it's (39:47 - 39:50)
fun I think it was very ahead of its (39:49 - 39:52)
time when it came out (39:50 - 39:55)
yeah somebody asked on socials if (39:52 - 39:58)
you can play multiplayer on it like you (39:55 - 40:01)
could in the original game and I have no (39:58 - 40:03)
clue you should be able to I should be (40:01 - 40:05)
able to I can't find anything that (40:03 - 40:09)
confirms that yes you can play (40:05 - 40:12)
multiplayer on the TCG like you could (40:09 - 40:14)
back in the day I haven't found anybody (40:12 - 40:16)
that says yes (40:14 - 40:17)
it (40:16 - 40:20)
should work I I don't know I haven't (40:17 - 40:24)
played it to test it out (40:20 - 40:24)
I was thinking more about this this (40:24 - 40:27)
weekend mostly because every time (40:26 - 40:31)
there's a Pokemon presents people (40:27 - 40:31)
complain slash asks slash wonder when if (40:32 - 40:40)
ever red blue yellow gold silver Ruby (40:37 - 40:42)
Sapphire whatever name your Pokemon game (40:40 - 40:44)
when are they going to come to Virtual (40:42 - 40:46)
Console those words don't exist anymore (40:44 - 40:48)
because because Nintendo hasn't used (40:46 - 40:51)
Virtual Console in seven years or (40:48 - 40:54)
whatever but anyways when are these old (40:51 - 40:57)
Pokemon games going to come to the (40:54 - 41:01)
Future and the more I thought about it (40:57 - 41:03)
I don't think ever I don't think they're (41:01 - 41:06)
ever coming a couple reasons number one (41:03 - 41:08)
is on the 3DS (41:06 - 41:12)
when you bought them you were giving (41:08 - 41:15)
Game Freak the majority of the money (41:12 - 41:17)
right you were paying nine dollars for (41:15 - 41:18)
them (41:17 - 41:20)
when you subscribe to Nintendo switch (41:18 - 41:21)
online (41:20 - 41:24)
you were giving Nintendo the majority of (41:21 - 41:28)
the money and like probably like Spotify (41:24 - 41:31)
like iTunes you're getting pennies back (41:28 - 41:33)
because they got to split it between all (41:31 - 41:35)
the games on the services right and for (41:33 - 41:38)
Nintendo that's not a loss (41:35 - 41:40)
right because most of that stuff is (41:38 - 41:42)
their games (41:40 - 41:46)
the other thing we know this as a fact (41:42 - 41:48)
the Pokemon company slash game freak (41:46 - 41:51)
doesn't like any Cloud saves (41:48 - 41:53)
it's one of the few games that do not (41:51 - 41:57)
work with Nintendo switch online and how (41:53 - 41:58)
the Nintendo switch (41:57 - 42:00)
how is it was it called the Nintendo (41:58 - 42:02)
switch online (42:00 - 42:05)
um yeah how that works is every single (42:02 - 42:07)
game has that rewind feature (42:05 - 42:11)
you can rewind time there's no game that (42:07 - 42:12)
has that disabled somebody can correct (42:11 - 42:15)
me if I'm wrong so when you put the (42:12 - 42:17)
weight of (42:15 - 42:19)
gamefreak doesn't like rewind (42:17 - 42:22)
they they don't want you to do that (42:19 - 42:23)
they're very protective of you (42:22 - 42:25)
duplicating Pokemon or adding Pokemon to (42:23 - 42:27)
a cloud and then going backwards and (42:25 - 42:30)
then getting them back again and for (42:27 - 42:31)
whatever reason that's a whole other (42:30 - 42:33)
argument whether you care or think (42:31 - 42:34)
that's worth it right we just know that (42:33 - 42:37)
game freak doesn't like that and Game (42:34 - 42:41)
Freak slash Pokemon knows that their IP (42:37 - 42:44)
is incredibly valuable so why would they (42:41 - 42:48)
put that on a service just to get (42:44 - 42:51)
barely any Revenue when they can do what (42:48 - 42:53)
they have been doing release something (42:51 - 42:57)
as bad as bdsp and become one of the (42:53 - 42:59)
best-selling remakes of all time and (42:57 - 43:02)
just cash in why would they put red blue (42:59 - 43:04)
yellow up there when they could make a (43:02 - 43:06)
game like let's go when they can do (43:04 - 43:09)
their own thing avoid the rewind feature (43:06 - 43:11)
avoid Nintendo taking most of the (43:09 - 43:13)
profits and (43:11 - 43:15)
the more I think about it I just I don't (43:13 - 43:17)
think they're ever coming (43:15 - 43:19)
the 3DS was so different because you (43:17 - 43:21)
were buying them directly and giving (43:19 - 43:24)
game freak that money (43:21 - 43:26)
the most of the money (43:24 - 43:29)
the only (43:26 - 43:29)
pin I could put in that as I could see (43:30 - 43:37)
them doing a big push for the 30th (43:34 - 43:39)
anniversary (43:37 - 43:42)
to like re-explore Our Roots is about (43:39 - 43:44)
the only way I could see them being (43:42 - 43:47)
convinced to (43:44 - 43:50)
put them back out in a form (43:47 - 43:52)
in that form like that's the only (43:50 - 43:54)
scenario that I can think (43:52 - 43:57)
they would want to have a year of things (43:54 - 43:59)
coming out so we're going to do all (43:57 - 44:01)
these games coming to Nintendo online (43:59 - 44:04)
probably towards the end of life of the (44:01 - 44:06)
switch at that point because 30 years (44:04 - 44:07)
like what (44:06 - 44:09)
two to three years away (44:07 - 44:11)
so (44:09 - 44:12)
that's the only time like I don't I (44:11 - 44:14)
don't think they have (44:12 - 44:18)
much desire to put them back out like (44:14 - 44:21)
they in their time frame they just did (44:18 - 44:22)
it (44:21 - 44:25)
so (44:22 - 44:25)
I I I and I think you know same thing (44:26 - 44:30)
with Detective Pikachu it's coming out (44:29 - 44:32)
this weird time like they missed the (44:30 - 44:33)
Mark I feel like if you're gonna put out (44:32 - 44:37)
red blue yellow you put them out around (44:33 - 44:38)
Stadium (44:37 - 44:40)
um and you (44:38 - 44:43)
I mean they added Pokemon Bank to the (44:40 - 44:44)
original ones right if they put them out (44:43 - 44:46)
they would have to add (44:44 - 44:48)
Pokemon home (44:46 - 44:50)
so it's like (44:48 - 44:50)
you have the Game Boy Player and stay I (44:50 - 44:54)
don't know it just it just feels like (44:52 - 44:58)
that ship has sailed at this point (44:54 - 44:59)
yeah (44:58 - 45:01)
not good news for game preservation but (44:59 - 45:04)
yeah (45:01 - 45:08)
oh I I'm sure they'll come back around (45:04 - 45:08)
freak like their fans love nostalgia (45:12 - 45:19)
they know (45:16 - 45:21)
uh Pokemon go (45:19 - 45:24)
there was a Pokemon uh they just said (45:21 - 45:26)
you know Pokemon go Fest is coming to (45:24 - 45:27)
New York there will be the two-day (45:26 - 45:30)
digital Global Fest on August 26th and (45:27 - 45:32)
August 27th (45:30 - 45:33)
um (45:32 - 45:36)
and I had Niantic forgot that Galler (45:33 - 45:38)
Pokemon existed because we're skipping (45:36 - 45:41)
those and we're going right to pelvis I (45:38 - 45:43)
want core of a night I'm so sad that (45:41 - 45:45)
we're not getting rookity before we get (45:43 - 45:47)
into the paldea Pokemon (45:45 - 45:48)
I (45:47 - 45:51)
want my boltons (45:48 - 45:54)
ding dang it (45:51 - 45:54)
I know (45:54 - 45:58)
a lot of those choices come from like (45:56 - 46:00)
the Pokemon company of like here's the (45:58 - 46:01)
Pokemon the Pokemon company wants to (46:00 - 46:05)
feature like hey Niantic you didn't make (46:01 - 46:07)
Pokemon sleep but um you're gonna (46:05 - 46:10)
promote Snorlax because we're promoting (46:07 - 46:13)
Pokemon sleep right like I get it (46:10 - 46:13)
don't know why they just (46:14 - 46:19)
they had an opportunity to line up (46:17 - 46:23)
paldea with scarlet and violet and to be (46:19 - 46:24)
frank maybe they didn't need it (46:23 - 46:26)
obviously Scarlet Violet sold very well (46:24 - 46:29)
but it just (46:26 - 46:32)
I this like weird like oh eight months (46:29 - 46:33)
later we're getting Pokemon like (46:32 - 46:35)
wouldn't you want (46:33 - 46:36)
this is the business maybe this maybe (46:35 - 46:38)
this is why I'm not a businessman but (46:36 - 46:40)
wouldn't you want like the new Pokemon (46:38 - 46:42)
not all of them but some of them to (46:40 - 46:45)
appear and go so people who only play go (46:42 - 46:46)
go (46:45 - 46:50)
or say wow look at this (46:46 - 46:52)
um flamingo (46:50 - 46:54)
that's new oh it's in this new game that (46:52 - 46:55)
just came out (46:54 - 46:59)
like that's my logic but (46:55 - 47:01)
they may be working towards just the (46:59 - 47:03)
timeline I'm seeing they may be working (47:01 - 47:05)
towards doing that for the 10th (47:03 - 47:06)
Generation (47:05 - 47:08)
that once they do this once they've (47:06 - 47:11)
gotten paldea and gala are all figured (47:08 - 47:13)
out then it sounds like they're gonna be (47:11 - 47:17)
on top of it for the next gen (47:13 - 47:19)
that depends how many employees are left (47:17 - 47:22)
on Niantic though yeah that's true I'm (47:19 - 47:25)
being generous (47:22 - 47:25)
yeah I mean like (47:28 - 47:32)
that (47:30 - 47:35)
sure whatever they're just starters yeah (47:32 - 47:37)
the starters are coming and they skipped (47:35 - 47:39)
a generation my reasons shush go away (47:37 - 47:42)
don't think you might like the shoe (47:39 - 47:43)
trailer was pretty hyped though like (47:42 - 47:46)
that was a cool way to reveal start like (47:43 - 47:48)
the shoes were cool I thought it was (47:46 - 47:50)
like you like shoes it was hype I guess (47:48 - 47:52)
it was confusing otherwise (47:50 - 47:56)
I literally thought (47:52 - 47:58)
is this a partnership I haven't heard of (47:56 - 48:00)
I thought maybe more customization was (47:58 - 48:03)
coming I mean because one of the things (48:00 - 48:06)
you can customize are shoes uh and then (48:03 - 48:09)
they're like guess what and I'm like oh (48:06 - 48:13)
that's it I mean I want shoes I actually (48:09 - 48:16)
want some of those shoes (48:13 - 48:16)
um Pokemon sleep is getting their first (48:16 - 48:24)
event uh which is going to occur the on (48:19 - 48:27)
the night of a full moon on good sleep (48:24 - 48:30)
days isn't it like National sleep day (48:27 - 48:32)
like coming up too I think (48:30 - 48:34)
um drowsy power will be powered up you (48:32 - 48:37)
can encounter more rare Pokemon (48:34 - 48:40)
uh (48:37 - 48:40)
but this would be at the end of August (48:40 - 48:44)
if they're actually timing it for the (48:43 - 48:47)
next full moon oh okay okay yeah where (48:44 - 48:51)
else didn't announce a specific pitch (48:47 - 48:51)
oh I'd sleep days sleep week that (48:52 - 48:56)
already happened I tweeted at a Pokemon (48:55 - 48:58)
sleep Twitter account back when Twitter (48:56 - 49:00)
was a thing (48:58 - 49:00)
the next full moon yeah me too is gonna (49:02 - 49:07)
be at the end of end of August they just (49:05 - 49:09)
didn't announce a specific date for this (49:07 - 49:12)
for some reason yeah (49:09 - 49:12)
um they announced some United States (49:13 - 49:16)
full circle back to unite and the second (49:14 - 49:17)
half of the show (49:16 - 49:19)
um Pokemon Masters ex (49:17 - 49:23)
nimona and Palma are coming to master ZX (49:19 - 49:25)
they were like it's dropping today and (49:23 - 49:29)
it did I got it on my second pull I was (49:25 - 49:31)
very happy (49:29 - 49:33)
um you get 3 000 gems if you just log (49:31 - 49:35)
into the celebration August 16th Victor (49:33 - 49:38)
and Specter will be coming to the game (49:35 - 49:41)
uh and if you'd like to get scammed (49:38 - 49:45)
Pokemon cafe remix is still around and (49:41 - 49:47)
they are still remixing (49:45 - 49:50)
they they added uh (49:47 - 49:54)
summer fun Jigglypuff and five star Chef (49:50 - 49:57)
tropical vaporeana not to be confused (49:54 - 50:00)
with five star Chef Vaporeon this is the (49:57 - 50:02)
tropical version (50:00 - 50:04)
um Plus sprigatido for Coco quaxley have (50:02 - 50:06)
returned (50:04 - 50:08)
ah and I think they added Mewtwo (50:06 - 50:11)
recently which we Mewtwo's and unite (50:08 - 50:13)
meeches and detective Pikachu Mewtwo's (50:11 - 50:15)
and Cafe remix Mewtwo's coming to (50:13 - 50:17)
scarlet and violet like (50:15 - 50:20)
why was the Pokemon presents (50:17 - 50:24)
purple neon and flashed a weird M that (50:20 - 50:27)
was never answered we can just assume it (50:24 - 50:28)
was me too (50:27 - 50:31)
which is I think what we said last week (50:28 - 50:33)
yeah there was the Mewtwo event that did (50:31 - 50:35)
get announced so (50:33 - 50:37)
they just never tied it together (50:35 - 50:41)
there's no neon in that announcement (50:37 - 50:41)
that presents (50:42 - 50:46)
so sure (50:45 - 50:52)
I guess it was okay it's fine presents (50:46 - 50:55)
I think I have to check if I won the (50:52 - 50:57)
unite prediction I have to get in day (50:55 - 51:00)
and night (50:57 - 51:00)
before I go to Brick I think there's a (51:01 - 51:04)
longer conversation that we're (51:03 - 51:06)
definitely not going to have here of (51:04 - 51:08)
weather (51:06 - 51:11)
these presents are (51:08 - 51:16)
too many with a lot of fluff versus not (51:11 - 51:20)
having one like I was pretty satisfied (51:16 - 51:23)
but I feel like I'm easy to satisfy (51:20 - 51:24)
versus people being like there was (51:23 - 51:26)
nothing in that (51:24 - 51:28)
um but then it's like people complain (51:26 - 51:31)
that there hasn't been news (51:28 - 51:35)
I'm I will always fall on the side of (51:31 - 51:37)
more communication (51:35 - 51:39)
than not (51:37 - 51:41)
and even if you think oh there was (51:39 - 51:42)
nothing in there it was fluff they (51:41 - 51:44)
didn't do anything (51:42 - 51:47)
it is still better to know that they are (51:44 - 51:49)
working on things and presenting the (51:47 - 51:51)
ideas and underlying them than to just (51:49 - 51:54)
be radio silent for months on end like (51:51 - 51:56)
and it's good for the people who are (51:54 - 51:59)
playing those games yeah I'm sure three (51:56 - 52:02)
Cafe mix fans are very happy oh yeah but (51:59 - 52:04)
I think also people sort of ignore that (52:02 - 52:08)
in a vacuum all y'all will fill that (52:04 - 52:11)
vacuum with nonsense so I would rather (52:08 - 52:13)
not give you tons of space to fill that (52:11 - 52:16)
vacuum with nonsense thank you very much (52:13 - 52:21)
uh what about the bridge what about the (52:16 - 52:23)
staple Pokemon when are we getting a (52:21 - 52:27)
staple Pokemon that can be removed (52:23 - 52:27)
I thought it was okay oh that was an (52:29 - 52:33)
arcade presents you know the thing some (52:30 - 52:34)
things are great some things are bad (52:33 - 52:37)
whatever like they've got a lot going on (52:34 - 52:38)
right now it wasn't the most exciting (52:37 - 52:41)
but it they've got a lot going on yeah (52:38 - 52:43)
smaller things (52:41 - 52:43)
was a fun thing to watch for the brief (52:44 - 52:48)
amount that it was on and then I moved (52:46 - 52:49)
on with my life (52:48 - 52:52)
pretty much speaking of smaller things (52:49 - 52:54)
there was a small thing called Pokemon (52:52 - 52:57)
worlds in Yokohama and we're gonna talk (52:54 - 53:00)
about that did that happen (52:57 - 53:04)
uh yeah yeah yeah I did crazy go (53:00 - 53:06)
because I couldn't afford to Hannah did (53:04 - 53:10)
you go to um (53:06 - 53:12)
I just decided to (53:10 - 53:15)
record in a hotel room (53:12 - 53:19)
at 1am for fun well I mean 1am is not (53:15 - 53:21)
that unusual for a thing that Steve (53:19 - 53:23)
decides that's the only normal part (53:21 - 53:24)
about this that's the only normal part (53:23 - 53:27)
about any of this right now (53:24 - 53:29)
all right we'll be right back (53:27 - 53:32)
and we are back from break (53:29 - 53:34)
uh (53:32 - 53:36)
uh so (53:34 - 53:39)
the Pokemon world championships have (53:36 - 53:43)
finished in Yokohama I am still in (53:39 - 53:45)
Yokohama I'm leaving tomorrow I'm going (53:43 - 53:49)
to Tokyo uh and I'll be there so I guess (53:45 - 53:51)
side note I'll be streaming in Tokyo on (53:49 - 53:52)
Twitch this (53:51 - 53:54)
upcoming week so if you want to see (53:52 - 53:58)
Japan and Pokemon go and (53:54 - 54:01)
whatever else then we're done I guess (53:58 - 54:04)
come to the twitch streams (54:01 - 54:04)
uh I think you guys watched a little bit (54:05 - 54:10)
of it I was I was here (54:07 - 54:11)
um (54:10 - 54:14)
so you know I was at London I've been to (54:11 - 54:16)
Nashville I've been to DC I've been to (54:14 - 54:17)
San Diego I've been to quite a few (54:16 - 54:20)
worlds so I could safely say that this (54:17 - 54:23)
has was the biggest worlds they've done (54:20 - 54:26)
um (54:23 - 54:26)
uh I (54:26 - 54:34)
there was so much to do (54:30 - 54:36)
that (54:34 - 54:37)
I don't think you could do everything (54:36 - 54:40)
like they they succeeded this was the (54:37 - 54:43)
year where they were like (54:40 - 54:46)
you can even even if you didn't get into (54:43 - 54:49)
the 20 lotteries (54:46 - 54:49)
yeah even if you didn't get into the (54:51 - 54:57)
lotteries there was still so much to do (54:53 - 55:01)
um that they put on and (54:57 - 55:04)
uh I guess there's that that (55:01 - 55:07)
stigma or that stereotype maybe (55:04 - 55:09)
stereotype's a better word that like (55:07 - 55:12)
Japan just loves Pokemon more than (55:09 - 55:14)
everyone else and it's just built into (55:12 - 55:17)
the culture that is a hundred percent (55:14 - 55:18)
true (55:17 - 55:22)
kids parents 20 year olds 30 year olds (55:18 - 55:23)
businessmen (55:22 - 55:26)
cult leaders no there's no Cults that (55:23 - 55:28)
abducted me this time that was the last (55:26 - 55:32)
time yeah not yet still 10 more days to (55:28 - 55:33)
find one (55:32 - 55:37)
like just (55:33 - 55:39)
these people (55:37 - 55:40)
everywhere that I just described wanted (55:39 - 55:43)
to do everything they were okay with (55:40 - 55:45)
waiting in long lines to get pictures (55:43 - 55:49)
with the the wall art or lines for (55:45 - 55:50)
Pokemon Center or Alliance for pictures (55:49 - 55:53)
with statues or just taking pictures of (55:50 - 55:56)
like it's just (55:53 - 56:00)
something that you don't see at like a (55:56 - 56:02)
Nashville or a London like you see (56:00 - 56:03)
Pokemon fans right you see people who (56:02 - 56:05)
love Pokemon you see competitors you see (56:03 - 56:07)
people that travel for Pokemon but you (56:05 - 56:11)
don't see like this level of (56:07 - 56:14)
love for the brand it's almost probably (56:11 - 56:16)
like (56:14 - 56:19)
people who live Disney that's probably (56:16 - 56:21)
the closest America has I think is (56:19 - 56:24)
Disney fans but Disney's not everywhere (56:21 - 56:25)
it's (56:24 - 56:28)
Florida and California well it is (56:25 - 56:31)
everywhere but like (56:28 - 56:31)
if they weren't so litigious it would be (56:31 - 56:37)
in a lot more places (56:34 - 56:42)
[Laughter] (56:37 - 56:46)
but yeah imagine turning a city into (56:42 - 56:50)
Disney World but everyone in this city (56:46 - 56:54)
slash country loves the thing you just (56:50 - 56:56)
turned it into (56:54 - 56:56)
it was cool it was really cool (56:56 - 56:58)
[Music] (56:58 - 56:59)
um (56:58 - 57:01)
so (56:59 - 57:03)
uh I I don't even I don't even know (57:01 - 57:05)
where to start I think I think if you (57:03 - 57:07)
guys have questions I can I can answer (57:05 - 57:09)
and and we can go through before we (57:07 - 57:11)
tackle the end announcement with just (57:09 - 57:14)
the end announcements aren't that in (57:11 - 57:16)
depth they're pretty short announcements (57:14 - 57:18)
did you get did you get to see any of (57:16 - 57:20)
the raffle stuff like did you get to go (57:18 - 57:22)
in the ship or any of that or is that (57:20 - 57:24)
yeah (57:22 - 57:25)
um (57:24 - 57:27)
there was the ship was a raffle I got to (57:25 - 57:30)
go on the ship today (57:27 - 57:35)
um the there was a festival (57:30 - 57:37)
um with like Festival mini games it was (57:35 - 57:41)
a very Japanese Summer Festival (57:37 - 57:42)
um it was just Pokemon themed obviously (57:41 - 57:45)
I got to go into that that was a lottery (57:42 - 57:48)
um both the the festivals on YouTube if (57:45 - 57:51)
you want to see that the ship stuff will (57:48 - 57:52)
come to YouTube I think the ship was (57:51 - 57:53)
really really I think both were really (57:52 - 57:54)
cool (57:53 - 57:59)
the I went to a 3D dance show that was (57:54 - 58:00)
also a lottery thing (57:59 - 58:04)
where dancing Pikachu I saw Lucario do a (58:00 - 58:07)
backflip and then watched him Naruto run (58:04 - 58:08)
off the stage (58:07 - 58:11)
um I watched a cinder race kick a (58:08 - 58:14)
digital Fireball and then fire actually (58:11 - 58:18)
flared out of the stage that was cool uh (58:14 - 58:21)
there was a Pikachu Greninja Lucario (58:18 - 58:24)
cinderase (58:21 - 58:24)
Zara aura (58:24 - 58:31)
and Pokemon with legs you know that some (58:26 - 58:33)
could argue they were humanoid (58:31 - 58:35)
the leg Pokemon (58:33 - 58:39)
uh that was like a 25 minute show of (58:35 - 58:42)
Just Pokemon dancing with fire blazing (58:39 - 58:43)
in the background it was really cool (58:42 - 58:45)
that was a ticket of event all the for (58:43 - 58:47)
the record all these ticket events were (58:45 - 58:48)
free (58:47 - 58:53)
you just had to win the ticket (58:48 - 58:53)
um (58:53 - 58:55)
there's probably a couple other things I (58:53 - 58:58)
did I have to look at my notes but yes (58:55 - 59:00)
um again I even without the ticket of (58:58 - 59:01)
events there was still more than enough (59:00 - 59:04)
to do (59:01 - 59:04)
um the Pokemon sun or line was (59:04 - 59:12)
absolutely insane and people were very (59:08 - 59:14)
okay with waiting in it (59:12 - 59:17)
also it was the same thing as Pokemon (59:14 - 59:22)
centers in the US in the sense of (59:17 - 59:23)
when you win a lottery ticket for (59:22 - 59:25)
Pokemon Center (59:23 - 59:27)
or you're just waiting in line in the (59:25 - 59:29)
U.S for Nationals it was like a QR code (59:27 - 59:32)
and then you got your time slot you can (59:29 - 59:34)
bring up to four people (59:32 - 59:38)
so what would happen is people would see (59:34 - 59:39)
you walking in the direction of the (59:38 - 59:41)
Pokemon Center and if they saw there was (59:39 - 59:44)
like two of you they would go up and ask (59:41 - 59:46)
if you had a ticket and if you were full (59:44 - 59:49)
with four and if they could be your two (59:46 - 59:51)
extra friends people were very bold (59:49 - 59:53)
Japanese people English people they were (59:51 - 59:55)
like hey are you going to Pokemon Center (59:53 - 59:57)
well do you have spots for me like you (59:55 - 59:59)
can like no I know you can break up to (59:57 - 60:00)
four (59:59 - 60:01)
um (60:00 - 60:03)
I know you guys aren't going to ask this (60:01 - 60:04)
I'll get this out of the way right away (60:03 - 60:06)
uh there was a fist fight in the Pokemon (60:04 - 60:08)
Center people were actually punching (60:06 - 60:10)
each other for a bear Walker skateboard (60:08 - 60:14)
and the police were called and they were (60:10 - 60:16)
escorted out I heard my first question (60:14 - 60:17)
was (60:16 - 60:19)
were they American (60:17 - 60:22)
because that's what I thought they were (60:19 - 60:25)
Japanese uh but (60:22 - 60:28)
there was only 500 bear Walkers (60:25 - 60:31)
skateboards they were (60:28 - 60:35)
a lot I think they were 250 USD or (60:31 - 60:36)
whatever (60:35 - 60:38)
um the American dollar is really strong (60:36 - 60:40)
here so (60:38 - 60:41)
um (60:40 - 60:44)
the police were called twice for this (60:41 - 60:45)
event (60:44 - 60:47)
the first I shouldn't be laughing the (60:45 - 60:50)
first was a fist fight over a skateboard (60:47 - 60:53)
uh which resulted in both men getting (60:50 - 60:56)
arrested the second time the police were (60:53 - 60:57)
called which I don't know if it was (60:56 - 61:01)
before or after the fist fight was (60:57 - 61:05)
uh somebody's binder of thousands of (61:01 - 61:06)
dollars of Pokemon cards that they were (61:05 - 61:11)
selling got stolen which stealing is (61:06 - 61:14)
really not a thing in Japan (61:11 - 61:16)
um like it's pretty frond upon like I (61:14 - 61:19)
when I was at go Fest I left my backpack (61:16 - 61:22)
for like 20 minutes and it was fine when (61:19 - 61:23)
I came back to it (61:22 - 61:26)
um I mean stealing is frowned upon here (61:23 - 61:28)
too (61:26 - 61:32)
[Laughter] (61:28 - 61:37)
if it's left just take it I mean that's (61:32 - 61:40)
how good it is right (61:37 - 61:40)
you know what we're gonna say it's just (61:41 - 61:45)
it's something you hear about when you (61:43 - 61:48)
are going to Japan or travel of any sort (61:45 - 61:49)
when I lived there for three months that (61:48 - 61:50)
was something I heard when I was (61:49 - 61:52)
researching how to be there for three (61:50 - 61:54)
months because I was like 18 years old (61:52 - 61:56)
and I was gonna be there by myself so (61:54 - 61:59)
yeah I learned about how you just theft (61:56 - 62:01)
doesn't happen as much (61:59 - 62:02)
mm-hmm (62:01 - 62:03)
um (62:02 - 62:05)
I have no clue I don't think they ever (62:03 - 62:07)
found the person who stole so (62:05 - 62:09)
this is a thing that happens at a lot of (62:07 - 62:14)
Worlds or even NAIC or ocic where people (62:09 - 62:17)
will come with binders and they set up (62:14 - 62:19)
shop they will just find a coffee table (62:17 - 62:22)
or something and there'll be a whole row (62:19 - 62:24)
of them and there's (62:22 - 62:26)
they're selling cards right they're (62:24 - 62:28)
they're in the trading Booth maybe (62:26 - 62:30)
they're trading right I'm sure trades (62:28 - 62:32)
are happening but the majority of it is (62:30 - 62:36)
we're selling you cards like you're (62:32 - 62:38)
flipping through the binder and they got (62:36 - 62:41)
30 Charizards (62:38 - 62:43)
and they're selling them for a thousand (62:41 - 62:44)
dollars each right (62:43 - 62:47)
um so that was very prevalent day one (62:44 - 62:49)
and day two and then day three I woke up (62:47 - 62:51)
walked outside and there was signs (62:49 - 62:52)
literally every four feet of (62:51 - 62:55)
no selling or trading Pokemon cards (62:52 - 62:57)
in the (62:55 - 62:59)
sounds like my Elementary School (62:57 - 63:02)
playground yeah um I don't know where (62:59 - 63:04)
the sellers went I'm sure they moved (63:02 - 63:08)
somewhere okay they moved (63:04 - 63:08)
but uh they were left alone the first (63:08 - 63:15)
two days I don't know if the Pokemon (63:11 - 63:19)
company likes that I don't know if they (63:15 - 63:21)
like a bunch of people selling old play (63:19 - 63:23)
mats for hundreds of dollars or deck (63:21 - 63:28)
boxes or three I there was a Leafeon (63:23 - 63:29)
card (63:28 - 63:31)
uh they also had all the other EVS but (63:29 - 63:33)
they were somebody somebody in the (63:31 - 63:34)
comments I don't know the name of this (63:33 - 63:36)
card I couldn't look it up (63:34 - 63:37)
I don't even know what to Google search (63:36 - 63:40)
but it's it's they're cards that were (63:37 - 63:41)
only in Japan and they have like a white (63:40 - 63:44)
background and the Pokemon is just like (63:41 - 63:48)
a doodle It's like a very (63:44 - 63:50)
um not like a kids doodle but like a (63:48 - 63:54)
very sharp artistic doodle so that was (63:50 - 63:56)
like Leafeon jolte like all the EVS (63:54 - 63:59)
right and this guy had like nine of each (63:56 - 64:01)
he had like full pages of them and (63:59 - 64:03)
somebody was asking about the Umbreon (64:01 - 64:05)
and like obviously they had to get a (64:03 - 64:07)
translator and then he came back and he (64:05 - 64:09)
was like five thousand dollars USD and I (64:07 - 64:11)
was like that then the guy was like this (64:09 - 64:14)
is way too much like I paid 2008 to 800 (64:11 - 64:16)
for it and he was like well did you was (64:14 - 64:18)
it graded was it not graded and he was (64:16 - 64:20)
like it was graded like you're charging (64:18 - 64:22)
way too much and he was like this is (64:20 - 64:24)
what I'm offering and I was like well (64:22 - 64:26)
you know umbreon's always like super (64:24 - 64:28)
expensive and I was like I I want to see (64:26 - 64:30)
so like I flipped through and I was like (64:28 - 64:32)
no one likes Leafeon I was like how much (64:30 - 64:35)
is the how much is the Leafeon and he (64:32 - 64:37)
was like three thousand dollars I was (64:35 - 64:39)
like this this I I don't know if this is (64:37 - 64:41)
like the right price because (64:39 - 64:43)
I don't know the name of this card like (64:41 - 64:44)
I don't know what to look it up is it (64:43 - 64:47)
these hold on (64:44 - 64:50)
let me where the heck is the chat in (64:47 - 64:53)
this program (64:50 - 64:53)
yes yes those are it yep okay (64:58 - 65:07)
uh they are uh you nagaba Apple Eevee (65:01 - 65:11)
evolution cards uh the (65:07 - 65:12)
I don't know what you Google search to (65:11 - 65:15)
find that you want to know what I've got (65:12 - 65:19)
search to find it I put in uh doodle (65:15 - 65:21)
Pokemon cards white background and then (65:19 - 65:23)
just look for something that matched (65:21 - 65:27)
what you were saying and I found the car (65:23 - 65:29)
that's why I said to you to confirm (65:27 - 65:31)
yeah yeah yeah (65:29 - 65:34)
um so on (65:31 - 65:34)
on eBay the first one I see is 21 for (65:35 - 65:43)
this Leafeon (65:40 - 65:43)
they were only released in Japan I maybe (65:43 - 65:48)
this is a fake card this is a PSA graded (65:46 - 65:50)
10 one (65:48 - 65:55)
um and it's gem mint PSA 10. 43 dollars (65:50 - 65:58)
and he said I again (65:55 - 66:01)
maybe he doesn't know how to convert yen (65:58 - 66:04)
to USD yeah (66:01 - 66:07)
but but the other guy with the Umbreon (66:04 - 66:09)
was like no I paid like two thousand (66:07 - 66:11)
dollars for mine again maybe (66:09 - 66:16)
maybe Brianna's anyways it was I I there (66:11 - 66:18)
was part of me that was like (66:16 - 66:21)
are they throwing out huge prices no The (66:18 - 66:23)
Umbreon is like a hundred dollars and (66:21 - 66:25)
this one is like 239 dollars (66:23 - 66:28)
mint 10. maybe they were a whole lot (66:25 - 66:30)
more before the card crash (66:28 - 66:33)
yes or maybe like (66:30 - 66:36)
yeah I mean I'm looking Japanese and (66:33 - 66:39)
like these nothing's over a hundred (66:36 - 66:42)
yeah like the whole I found that's why I (66:39 - 66:45)
was shocked that these two dudes so uh (66:42 - 66:48)
I was maybe like (66:45 - 66:50)
they weren't aware maybe they were like (66:48 - 66:54)
oh Americans don't know that Jeff like (66:50 - 66:55)
it's very accessible to get Japanese (66:54 - 66:58)
cards in America yeah (66:55 - 66:59)
I don't know if you know this yeah (66:58 - 67:02)
there's a thing called the internet (66:59 - 67:05)
but also if you're like trying to sell (67:02 - 67:07)
cards why are you like highballing (67:05 - 67:10)
people don't you want to move product (67:07 - 67:11)
like are you just (67:10 - 67:14)
highballing people because (67:11 - 67:16)
you you you're betting they don't know (67:14 - 67:18)
the prices of things like that one dude (67:16 - 67:20)
he he seemed to know the price right (67:18 - 67:21)
away (67:20 - 67:23)
um also there was a Pikachu with a KFC (67:21 - 67:25)
logo on it which was like I think (67:23 - 67:29)
Thailand or India somewhere around you (67:25 - 67:31)
know that general area that is not the (67:29 - 67:32)
US (67:31 - 67:35)
but I (67:32 - 67:37)
I don't know like it's so weird for like (67:35 - 67:39)
I should have looked for these at Gen (67:37 - 67:41)
Con because a bunch of them a bunch of (67:39 - 67:44)
places had like Japanese exclusive (67:41 - 67:47)
Pokemon cards and I didn't think to look (67:44 - 67:49)
for these (67:47 - 67:51)
um I don't want to sound like gatekeepy (67:49 - 67:53)
or like (67:51 - 67:56)
dismissive of people selling Pokemon (67:53 - 67:59)
cards that's like a perfectly okay hobby (67:56 - 68:01)
business but I feel like there's just (67:59 - 68:04)
something scummy about (68:01 - 68:06)
and I hate using that word but like even (68:04 - 68:09)
if I wanted to buy something I felt (68:06 - 68:11)
weird like (68:09 - 68:13)
like all these people they're just (68:11 - 68:15)
sitting there all weekend they don't (68:13 - 68:16)
care about the tournament they're just (68:15 - 68:18)
sitting there with binders and they have (68:16 - 68:20)
a bunch of boxes behind them and they're (68:18 - 68:22)
just waiting for you to like thumb (68:20 - 68:24)
through their stuff to be like here's a (68:22 - 68:27)
price you yeah and this is not exclusive (68:24 - 68:28)
to Yokohama (68:27 - 68:31)
KFC Pikachu was an Indonesia exclusive (68:28 - 68:33)
Indonesia Indonesia I think I think the (68:31 - 68:36)
issue is (68:33 - 68:40)
from our standpoint whenever you see (68:36 - 68:43)
somebody on the street selling something (68:40 - 68:45)
chances are good it's counterfeit or (68:43 - 68:47)
fake (68:45 - 68:48)
like that is that was another thing I (68:47 - 68:50)
thought about is like are these KFC (68:48 - 68:51)
Pikachus real because I want other (68:50 - 68:53)
authentic yeah I mean that's a pretty (68:51 - 68:55)
standard (68:53 - 68:57)
thing in America and you know we always (68:55 - 69:00)
hear like all the Chinese knockoffs like (68:57 - 69:01)
you always want to ask is this a wish (69:00 - 69:03)
version of this Pokemon card or is this (69:01 - 69:04)
real (69:03 - 69:06)
and you don't know right like when it's (69:04 - 69:08)
a person that's not tied to something (69:06 - 69:11)
that you can do your research on (69:08 - 69:14)
I would always say it is best to be (69:11 - 69:17)
skeptical of what they are selling (69:14 - 69:18)
because you just don't you don't know (69:17 - 69:20)
who they are you don't know where they (69:18 - 69:21)
get it from you don't know (69:20 - 69:23)
when they say I had it graded you have (69:21 - 69:26)
no way like there's nothing behind that (69:23 - 69:29)
to give that any sort of verification to (69:26 - 69:31)
sort of eliminate all of your fears (69:29 - 69:33)
around it like well I trust I would (69:31 - 69:34)
trust they're graded because they would (69:33 - 69:36)
have to send it in (69:34 - 69:39)
it has like a number to follow I mean (69:36 - 69:41)
yeah I trust that more than (69:39 - 69:43)
provided they didn't make up the numbers (69:41 - 69:45)
right like we all know what those look (69:43 - 69:50)
like like I would hope I don't know I (69:45 - 69:53)
would hope PSA has a good way of making (69:50 - 69:56)
sure people aren't counterfeiting PSA (69:53 - 69:58)
I'm sure they do but you're not going to (69:56 - 69:59)
know that sitting on the side of the (69:58 - 70:01)
street looking at it if it looks like a (69:59 - 70:04)
PSA thing like how am I gonna what am I (70:01 - 70:06)
gonna do right then and there with the (70:04 - 70:08)
person pressuring me (70:06 - 70:12)
yeah I think like like at uh NAIC they (70:08 - 70:13)
had like Yeti gaming and a bunch of (70:12 - 70:16)
other like stores and that didn't feel (70:13 - 70:18)
weird because they're (70:16 - 70:20)
they're businesses like there is like (70:18 - 70:22)
they're (70:20 - 70:24)
they don't want to take in cards that (70:22 - 70:25)
are fake (70:24 - 70:28)
they want to make sure that they're but (70:25 - 70:30)
versus like you know just a Japanese (70:28 - 70:33)
dude or a British dude or a German dude (70:30 - 70:35)
sitting on the side (70:33 - 70:37)
with two binders all of Charizards being (70:35 - 70:39)
like how did you get so many Charizards (70:37 - 70:41)
and why are you charging 3 000 each like (70:39 - 70:44)
there's a lot of money like (70:41 - 70:45)
I'm not good like (70:44 - 70:47)
it makes sense something was stolen (70:45 - 70:50)
right there's just so much money (70:47 - 70:53)
sitting in a single area and there's so (70:50 - 70:56)
many people walking through (70:53 - 70:59)
um at a time like it's it's it's hard (70:56 - 71:00)
enough to (70:59 - 71:03)
like weave in and out of traffic and you (71:00 - 71:05)
just have people sitting at little (71:03 - 71:07)
coffee tables or or on the floor because (71:05 - 71:10)
there's not enough space so it's not (71:07 - 71:12)
surprising something got stolen the Gen (71:10 - 71:14)
Con theft has y'all beat two people (71:12 - 71:16)
walking up with an entire pallet of (71:14 - 71:17)
cards (71:16 - 71:20)
laughs (71:17 - 71:23)
that's nice though (71:20 - 71:23)
I was saying not okay let's change (71:25 - 71:29)
topics I was saying for weeks that I (71:27 - 71:33)
thought Yokohama would be a disaster (71:29 - 71:35)
um and there was a lot that went wrong I (71:33 - 71:37)
think Hannah has a list of some things (71:35 - 71:42)
just a couple just a few uh drama Seeker (71:37 - 71:45)
Hannah here uh always on top of all the (71:42 - 71:49)
latest Goss and drama no I've been (71:45 - 71:51)
stressed and busy I've just been keeping (71:49 - 71:54)
up with the slack uh there are a couple (71:51 - 71:57)
of things particularly with VGC that (71:54 - 72:00)
happened this past weekend (71:57 - 72:03)
um that are just kind of standouts so (72:00 - 72:05)
the the less (72:03 - 72:09)
a controversial one is the land (72:05 - 72:10)
disconnects that happened to some of the (72:09 - 72:13)
players in the top 16 which is they (72:10 - 72:15)
disconnected and they had to play sudden (72:13 - 72:17)
death matches for their matches then (72:15 - 72:19)
this happened multiple times in the top (72:17 - 72:21)
16. (72:19 - 72:24)
which yes is unfortunate and sucks and I (72:21 - 72:26)
don't know if this has happened to this (72:24 - 72:28)
extent before (72:26 - 72:32)
but I also am not super tuned into top (72:28 - 72:34)
16 all the time (72:32 - 72:35)
um (72:34 - 72:37)
you know I think it was a bold choice (72:35 - 72:40)
for the Pokemon company to roll out (72:37 - 72:43)
spectator mode finally at a World (72:40 - 72:44)
tournament (72:43 - 72:47)
uh with a new stadium which for the (72:44 - 72:50)
record the new stadium with the lanterns (72:47 - 72:53)
and the actual crowd not just like (72:50 - 72:55)
Grandma cheering behind you and like the (72:53 - 72:57)
fireworks in the sky the new stadium (72:55 - 72:59)
looked great (72:57 - 72:59)
when they rolled out spectator mode (73:00 - 73:05)
which was the evening of day two (73:02 - 73:07)
it broke (73:05 - 73:10)
during an official world championship (73:07 - 73:14)
tournament it didn't work (73:10 - 73:16)
like the first match they use spectator (73:14 - 73:17)
mode (73:16 - 73:20)
we the viewer on Twitch I was in my (73:17 - 73:22)
hotel room because I was too tired (73:20 - 73:24)
I was not in the stadium (73:22 - 73:26)
we were not seeing spectator mode we (73:24 - 73:29)
were seeing one side of the battle and (73:26 - 73:31)
on top of that we were seeing the wrong (73:29 - 73:33)
side of the battle so the commentators (73:31 - 73:37)
were commentating the wrong (73:33 - 73:39)
side of the battle because they were (73:37 - 73:41)
also seeing the same thing we were (73:39 - 73:45)
seeing so it only made sense like 10 (73:41 - 73:46)
minutes into the battle when the (73:45 - 73:49)
commentators were like oh he woke up but (73:46 - 73:53)
they were talking about the other (73:49 - 73:57)
team where it was like oh and they the (73:53 - 74:00)
the two people fighting (73:57 - 74:02)
for the rollout of the spectator mode (74:00 - 74:04)
happened to have the six same Pokemon (74:02 - 74:07)
which before anyone says like oh the (74:04 - 74:09)
same Pokemon the teams were very (74:07 - 74:11)
different this entire tournament it just (74:09 - 74:13)
this matchup happened to have six (74:11 - 74:15)
similar Pokemon (74:13 - 74:17)
um (74:15 - 74:17)
that was a choice that was a choice it (74:18 - 74:26)
was sure a choice (74:21 - 74:26)
and yeah (74:26 - 74:31)
I don't know the official rule I should (74:28 - 74:32)
ask my friend Joe (74:31 - 74:35)
because he made top 32 so (74:32 - 74:37)
um which is incredible to make top 32 at (74:35 - 74:39)
Worlds absolutely an incredible (74:37 - 74:41)
accomplishment (74:39 - 74:44)
when and this has happened at nasc and (74:41 - 74:45)
other events where like two people would (74:44 - 74:48)
queue up and then you'll see both (74:45 - 74:50)
Pokemon come out and then all of a (74:48 - 74:51)
sudden it says like system has (74:50 - 74:53)
disconnected (74:51 - 74:55)
and then it's like 20 minutes to like (74:53 - 74:57)
repair them (74:55 - 74:59)
like (74:57 - 75:03)
do they play the same leads (74:59 - 75:05)
and if they do play the same leads what (75:03 - 75:07)
is stopping them from changing the two (75:05 - 75:08)
Pokemon in the back that you didn't see (75:07 - 75:12)
like if I see you led Tornadus or Shifu (75:08 - 75:14)
and I had two Pokemon in the back and (75:12 - 75:16)
I'm like oh they're bringing urshifu I'm (75:14 - 75:18)
going to switch like (75:16 - 75:21)
do the judges know is it like the same (75:18 - 75:23)
I'd like (75:21 - 75:26)
seeing what they lead is is part of the (75:23 - 75:28)
game right like it's (75:26 - 75:31)
leading is a very important part of the (75:28 - 75:34)
match composition (75:31 - 75:35)
well this shouldn't be happening though (75:34 - 75:38)
no (75:35 - 75:41)
no I mean I (75:38 - 75:43)
it's one of those things it's like I (75:41 - 75:45)
don't know what the solution is and (75:43 - 75:48)
especially in the moment but you should (75:45 - 75:49)
not (75:48 - 75:52)
you should not have multiple land (75:49 - 75:56)
disconnects right like that is (75:52 - 76:00)
that is just a thing especially in a (75:56 - 76:05)
in a in a in an arena and a game system (76:00 - 76:07)
that requires those connections to be (76:05 - 76:10)
solids to play your game (76:07 - 76:14)
and stuff happens I get it but it I sort (76:10 - 76:17)
of read people things online and like (76:14 - 76:19)
it's always hard because you're getting (76:17 - 76:22)
their side of things and they're upset (76:19 - 76:25)
about it and they're upset in the moment (76:22 - 76:27)
and (76:25 - 76:29)
if I was in a judge and had a set of (76:27 - 76:33)
rules I don't know what to do I you know (76:29 - 76:35)
what what what is the right decision (76:33 - 76:36)
given the situation like I don't know (76:35 - 76:39)
what that looks like and like the (76:36 - 76:40)
problem that we're getting from a lot of (76:39 - 76:41)
these reports is people are admitting (76:40 - 76:42)
that it happened but you're seeing the (76:41 - 76:44)
people who lost who are upset who are (76:42 - 76:46)
saying like I was (76:44 - 76:48)
I was gonna win the whole thing were you (76:46 - 76:51)
we don't (76:48 - 76:51)
yeah yeah and that said we can probably (76:51 - 76:59)
move into the next uh more controversial (76:56 - 77:01)
thing that has happened which is that I (76:59 - 77:03)
think more players have been (77:01 - 77:07)
disqualified this year than any other (77:03 - 77:09)
years in the top 16. (77:07 - 77:12)
or yeah in the top 16. that a number of (77:09 - 77:15)
players especially in the topic 16 once (77:12 - 77:17)
it got up there and I think before that (77:15 - 77:20)
too we're disqualified because of (77:17 - 77:23)
Pokemon (77:20 - 77:23)
um (77:23 - 77:27)
and that is an entire conversation on (77:24 - 77:30)
its own yeah I mean yes (77:27 - 77:32)
um a bit of the drama around people (77:30 - 77:36)
being mad that in order to have like (77:32 - 77:39)
some of the best things you had to have (77:36 - 77:42)
purchased all of these games and the (77:39 - 77:44)
costs going into it I'm like okay yeah (77:42 - 77:47)
but also like have you seen how much it (77:44 - 77:50)
costs to do any professional sport like (77:47 - 77:52)
I had to have the best trainer and the (77:50 - 77:54)
best coach and I had to have the best (77:52 - 77:56)
and I had like you ever buy a tennis (77:54 - 77:59)
racket yeah I like have you paid for (77:56 - 78:02)
skis like I get (77:59 - 78:08)
I get that this is electronic data but (78:02 - 78:11)
in a situation where you are trying to (78:08 - 78:14)
make your esport legitimate (78:11 - 78:18)
you do have to do some things to make (78:14 - 78:22)
sure people are playing legitimately and (78:18 - 78:25)
like I'm reading one tweets like I (78:22 - 78:27)
thought I was trading with a reputable (78:25 - 78:29)
Trader (78:27 - 78:32)
that was the old uh Ray Rizzo thing back (78:29 - 78:34)
when he had got the tell in a dream ball (78:32 - 78:36)
where Gothic hell couldn't be in a dream (78:34 - 78:38)
ball and they did not disqualify him (78:36 - 78:41)
right at the time he did lose so he (78:38 - 78:43)
didn't continue but that was still a (78:41 - 78:46)
huge debate at the time of like well he (78:43 - 78:48)
said he traded somebody this is (78:46 - 78:51)
obviously a hacked illegal Pokemon (78:48 - 78:54)
um he lost but what if he won like how (78:51 - 78:56)
does that look going forward (78:54 - 78:58)
and are you giving him special treatment (78:56 - 79:02)
because he's a two-time world champion I (78:58 - 79:04)
think at the time maybe three (79:02 - 79:07)
um versus if this was somebody else (79:04 - 79:09)
would the judge just pull the trigger (79:07 - 79:12)
and just be like okay we're D King you (79:09 - 79:15)
I mean last World Championships the (79:12 - 79:18)
Pokemon go world champion when he showed (79:15 - 79:21)
off his profile did have a number of (79:18 - 79:23)
steps that was actually impossible to (79:21 - 79:26)
have taken as a human being since the (79:23 - 79:30)
game had come out so there are players (79:26 - 79:31)
winning (79:30 - 79:34)
who have who have used things yeah use (79:31 - 79:36)
tools (79:34 - 79:36)
I think (79:37 - 79:42)
so it is it is up to the head judge (79:39 - 79:44)
that's number one yeah and I'm not sure (79:42 - 79:47)
who the head judge here was I would (79:44 - 79:49)
assume there was a couple head judges (79:47 - 79:51)
and one of them was probably Japanese (79:49 - 79:53)
based because obviously Japan has a lot (79:51 - 79:56)
of tournaments to Japanese Nationals and (79:53 - 79:57)
stuff right I don't know all the head (79:56 - 80:00)
judges there's also this black box that (79:57 - 80:04)
has existed since black and white and (80:00 - 80:07)
you whatever this black box does it (80:04 - 80:09)
reads your game and it it checks for (80:07 - 80:10)
Pokemon (80:09 - 80:13)
no one knows what the parameters of the (80:10 - 80:15)
black box is you know you could (80:13 - 80:17)
speculate the back black box is only (80:15 - 80:19)
checking for you know to make sure that (80:17 - 80:20)
Pikachu can't learn flamethrower right (80:19 - 80:22)
Pikachu has flamethrower all of a sudden (80:20 - 80:23)
it says it's illegal and then that (80:22 - 80:25)
doesn't pass the head check we don't (80:23 - 80:29)
actually know what the box does if we (80:25 - 80:31)
did know what the box did you would just (80:29 - 80:33)
build around it so they're never going (80:31 - 80:35)
to tell you what the box does right so (80:33 - 80:39)
it's easy to speculate that the box has (80:35 - 80:43)
been changed recently to read that more (80:39 - 80:47)
accurately for hack checks (80:43 - 80:47)
it is true based on (80:48 - 80:52)
people looking into people with (80:52 - 80:56)
Champions teams because Champions will (80:54 - 80:57)
post their teams and it's you know (80:56 - 81:00)
people can look into it and they could (80:57 - 81:01)
be like well this trend pow has six (81:00 - 81:04)
perfect IVs (81:01 - 81:06)
statistically that's possible but also (81:04 - 81:08)
statistically that's impossible because (81:06 - 81:12)
you're rolling like 32 times 32 times 32 (81:08 - 81:14)
because Chen Pao is supposed to be base (81:12 - 81:16)
three perfect IVs so the chance of you (81:14 - 81:18)
getting that is (81:16 - 81:21)
like you you would probably find like (81:18 - 81:23)
400 Chinese before you got like this (81:21 - 81:25)
yeah (81:23 - 81:27)
so like you could without the Black Box (81:25 - 81:29)
you could manually look at somebody's (81:27 - 81:32)
game and be like you have a tingloo and (81:29 - 81:34)
a Chien pow and they both have all (81:32 - 81:37)
perfect IVs like this is just not a (81:34 - 81:39)
realistic situation at all (81:37 - 81:41)
um (81:39 - 81:42)
so (81:41 - 81:44)
I don't know what those hack checks were (81:42 - 81:47)
but yes there were a lot of people that (81:44 - 81:50)
got banned for that but also remember (81:47 - 81:52)
that they banned (81:50 - 81:56)
four of the top ever best playing people (81:52 - 82:00)
in Korea they are never getting unbanned (81:56 - 82:03)
those players could have easily built a (82:00 - 82:05)
look they were all running metronome I (82:03 - 82:06)
don't know why they felt the need to (82:05 - 82:08)
hack it unless that was also a statement (82:06 - 82:11)
to the Pokemon company to be like we're (82:08 - 82:13)
hacking it and we're doing metronome but (82:11 - 82:15)
obviously it was very easy to get six of (82:13 - 82:17)
those Pokemon with just metronome within (82:15 - 82:20)
probably like 20 minutes (82:17 - 82:22)
um (82:20 - 82:22)
I've never hacked any of my Pokemon I've (82:22 - 82:27)
I mean I know I've received them from (82:25 - 82:29)
one to trade but yeah (82:27 - 82:31)
I I heard that some people were saying (82:29 - 82:34)
that the the box was checking all of (82:31 - 82:36)
their boxes and that's why they were (82:34 - 82:38)
banned like their team was legit but (82:36 - 82:39)
they might have gotten a hacked wonder (82:38 - 82:41)
trade that's not from my understanding (82:39 - 82:43)
how the black box works it specifically (82:41 - 82:44)
looks at your team because it has to (82:43 - 82:47)
look at your team in the battle box so (82:44 - 82:49)
once it's locked into the battle box it (82:47 - 82:51)
reads that specifically it doesn't read (82:49 - 82:54)
your entire PC (82:51 - 82:55)
um but at the end of the day it's up to (82:54 - 82:59)
the judge and so if the judge decided to (82:55 - 83:02)
enforce that check more that's their (82:59 - 83:04)
right as the head judge (83:02 - 83:05)
um (83:04 - 83:08)
back when black and white came out there (83:05 - 83:09)
was kind of the same thing that you (83:08 - 83:10)
brought up Hannah people were (83:09 - 83:11)
complaining that a lot of people were (83:10 - 83:13)
getting disqualified for hacked Pokemon (83:11 - 83:15)
the head judge at the time was Maryland (83:13 - 83:18)
and Maryland (83:15 - 83:20)
that was that was what he he wanted to (83:18 - 83:22)
check more cartridges than normal like (83:20 - 83:25)
he wanted to check do more random checks (83:22 - 83:28)
than past head judges and it upset (83:25 - 83:29)
people because (83:28 - 83:32)
they couldn't squeeze through this is a (83:29 - 83:34)
like there's going to be like the (83:32 - 83:36)
conversation of like well your Pokemon (83:34 - 83:39)
doesn't matter it's the skill yeah your (83:36 - 83:42)
ski your skill does matter but also what (83:39 - 83:44)
Greg said if you want this to be (83:42 - 83:48)
a legitimate Sport and you they create (83:44 - 83:49)
rules (83:48 - 83:51)
whether you like them or not but the (83:49 - 83:53)
important thing here is (83:51 - 83:55)
if they're creating rules and they're (83:53 - 83:56)
not enforcing the rules what's the point (83:55 - 83:58)
of the rules yeah if this rule doesn't (83:56 - 84:00)
matter what about this rule you didn't (83:58 - 84:02)
enforce this rule what about this Rule (84:00 - 84:04)
and I think like to be fair they should (84:02 - 84:07)
be enforcing the plush rule per the (84:04 - 84:09)
document you're only allowed to have two (84:07 - 84:11)
plushes on stage and there are people up (84:09 - 84:12)
there with three or four plushes they're (84:11 - 84:15)
breaking the rules and uh I mean like (84:12 - 84:17)
I've seen the arguments like it should (84:15 - 84:19)
be you know that it's not feasible to (84:17 - 84:21)
spend hundreds of hours on team (84:19 - 84:22)
composition and then it should be the (84:21 - 84:25)
best strategist and like we can get into (84:22 - 84:27)
the topic of grinding and how grindy the (84:25 - 84:31)
game is blah blah blah blah and like (84:27 - 84:34)
the answer to that is would it be better (84:31 - 84:37)
for you to submit the team that you want (84:34 - 84:39)
and have Pokemon created and give it to (84:37 - 84:43)
you at the competition and be like (84:39 - 84:46)
okay here's what you have like here's (84:43 - 84:47)
your rental team based off of what (84:46 - 84:48)
you've submitted because we've seen this (84:47 - 84:51)
as possible like (84:48 - 84:55)
there is no competition that exists that (84:51 - 84:58)
doesn't involve hours and hours and (84:55 - 85:01)
hours and hours and hours and hours and (84:58 - 85:03)
hours of prep (85:01 - 85:07)
that isn't a thing like you can go get a (85:03 - 85:09)
chess board and they're going to bring (85:07 - 85:10)
out a pristine chessboard and they're (85:09 - 85:13)
going to bring out a clean deck of cards (85:10 - 85:15)
and crack it the first time like if this (85:13 - 85:18)
is what you want then they can certainly (85:15 - 85:22)
do that (85:18 - 85:22)
but you have to decide what side you're (85:22 - 85:27)
falling on if you wanted to just be (85:25 - 85:30)
about strategist and not about team (85:27 - 85:32)
building then you're going to require (85:30 - 85:35)
that company to take that part away from (85:32 - 85:36)
you and just give you stuff to walk up (85:35 - 85:39)
on stage with (85:36 - 85:42)
um this isn't (85:39 - 85:44)
foreign (85:42 - 85:44)
isn't Fun correct but also (85:45 - 85:53)
nobody can be certain (85:50 - 85:56)
if you have things that are hacked (85:53 - 85:58)
that you're that good person that only (85:56 - 86:02)
went so far and you didn't cross the (85:58 - 86:04)
line and the unfortunate thing is (86:02 - 86:06)
whenever there's a line to cross where (86:04 - 86:11)
that line is is different for everybody (86:06 - 86:13)
and it is up to the Pokemon company to (86:11 - 86:15)
actually draw it hardcore and enforce it (86:13 - 86:18)
and they are bad at enforcing this (86:15 - 86:20)
sometimes and I do think that is (86:18 - 86:21)
something to be said about the Pokemon (86:20 - 86:23)
company is like you aren't great at (86:21 - 86:25)
enforcing all of your rules you need to (86:23 - 86:26)
get better at it (86:25 - 86:28)
um but you also if you want a Fair (86:26 - 86:31)
competition can't be (86:28 - 86:35)
outrageously upset that you got caught (86:31 - 86:38)
this time (86:35 - 86:38)
yeah I mean like (86:42 - 86:46)
what I I think there's like this like (86:44 - 86:49)
ironic ironic thing of like when you see (86:46 - 86:51)
somebody win I will use wolfglick as an (86:49 - 86:53)
example because like I think wolf flick (86:51 - 86:55)
is one of the more famous players but (86:53 - 86:57)
when he's won matches (86:55 - 86:59)
he goes up there and he's like here's (86:57 - 87:01)
the 18 people I want to thank this is (86:59 - 87:03)
the person I play tested with this is (87:01 - 87:04)
the person who gave me the idea for the (87:03 - 87:08)
team like like this is a common thing (87:04 - 87:11)
for (87:08 - 87:11)
consistently good VGC players where they (87:11 - 87:19)
work with multiple people so I don't (87:16 - 87:21)
really buy the like this is really (87:19 - 87:23)
grindy how am I going to get hershifu (87:21 - 87:25)
because you work (87:23 - 87:28)
or you play test with people (87:25 - 87:31)
not everyone but I'm saying like these (87:28 - 87:33)
the the the the the people that you see (87:31 - 87:35)
consistently wouldn't go back and watch (87:33 - 87:40)
it uh uh uh euic or NAIC I guarantee you (87:35 - 87:41)
the person that stands up there and wins (87:40 - 87:43)
names off a bunch of people they played (87:41 - 87:46)
with so like (87:43 - 87:49)
one of the the best player in the world (87:46 - 87:53)
which was Joe ux9 he had the most points (87:49 - 87:54)
out of anyone in the entire world this (87:53 - 87:57)
season he messaged a Discord group that (87:54 - 87:59)
I was in and said hey does anyone have a (87:57 - 88:02)
thunderous I need a shiny thunderous (87:59 - 88:04)
this weekend and I said Joe I got a (88:02 - 88:07)
shiny thunderous with five ribbons on it (88:04 - 88:09)
the prankster ability you let me know if (88:07 - 88:11)
you need me to change it and I will I (88:09 - 88:14)
will I will change it and he was so (88:11 - 88:16)
excited that's all it took was like Joe (88:14 - 88:18)
pinging a Discord and being like does (88:16 - 88:19)
anyone have this Pokemon and I thought (88:18 - 88:22)
to myself holy cow Joe's going to win (88:19 - 88:23)
this tournament and he's going to win it (88:22 - 88:25)
with my thunderous that's gonna be (88:23 - 88:27)
awesome I'll never win a tournament but (88:25 - 88:29)
one of my Pokemon can win a tournament (88:27 - 88:31)
and I sent him the thunderous and you (88:29 - 88:34)
know he ended up not using it because (88:31 - 88:36)
um he needed a little bit lower of like (88:34 - 88:38)
an attack set by Thunder has had like a (88:36 - 88:40)
perfect attack (88:38 - 88:43)
um so he ended up not using it but he (88:40 - 88:44)
just asked somebody else for another (88:43 - 88:48)
thunderous and he got it like (88:44 - 88:51)
it it's doable I'm not saying it's like (88:48 - 88:54)
the best (88:51 - 88:56)
um but (88:54 - 88:59)
like there's more than one Avenue to get (88:56 - 89:00)
a Pokemon (88:59 - 89:02)
you do have to trust those people you do (89:00 - 89:04)
have to trust I mean that is sometimes (89:02 - 89:06)
it has to be last minute and that's a (89:04 - 89:09)
hard thing to have work like looking at (89:06 - 89:12)
this game rant article uh Brady Smith (89:09 - 89:16)
says I tried I tried trading the mons (89:12 - 89:18)
with a reputable Trader but they didn't (89:16 - 89:21)
pass so you know when you're getting (89:18 - 89:23)
trades you have to rely that this person (89:21 - 89:27)
is telling you the truth and again (89:23 - 89:31)
that is a again everybody's line is (89:27 - 89:35)
different everybody's going to take the (89:31 - 89:39)
is this modified gend thing (89:35 - 89:45)
in a like by a different definition so (89:39 - 89:45)
you know his thing is like I wish they (89:46 - 89:52)
didn't wait until World worlds to up (89:49 - 89:53)
their game and it's like well if they (89:52 - 89:55)
were ever gonna up their game (89:53 - 89:57)
they banned a bunch of Korean people (89:55 - 90:00)
right they I mean they had established (89:57 - 90:02)
that they were doing this (90:00 - 90:04)
um and I feel the top four Koreans yeah (90:02 - 90:09)
I feel bad for them but also like (90:04 - 90:11)
there you know I don't know what your (90:09 - 90:14)
great solution is to to fix it other (90:11 - 90:17)
than turning it all over to the Pokemon (90:14 - 90:19)
company submitting your team ahead of (90:17 - 90:22)
time and letting them make it approve it (90:19 - 90:24)
and give it to you when you walk into (90:22 - 90:26)
the door right like which is a near (90:24 - 90:29)
impossible thing for a company to do (90:26 - 90:32)
depending on how many people are showing (90:29 - 90:34)
up for competition (90:32 - 90:37)
um the mere fact is everybody's going to (90:34 - 90:40)
take that line in a different spot and (90:37 - 90:44)
they have to make a decision and it is (90:40 - 90:47)
going to affect people (90:44 - 90:47)
yeah I mean like I think maybe the only (90:50 - 90:55)
thing I would I would well not the only (90:53 - 90:56)
thing there's a lot of things I I mean I (90:55 - 90:58)
see I see both sides of the argument but (90:56 - 91:00)
like the one thing is probably like The (90:58 - 91:02)
Rusted bottle cap or a bottle cap that (91:00 - 91:05)
would zero IV a Pokemon and the reason (91:02 - 91:07)
you would only do that is specifically (91:05 - 91:09)
for trick room or specifically for your (91:07 - 91:12)
attack stat this was the thunderous (91:09 - 91:14)
problem with Joe is you know he was (91:12 - 91:17)
running a support thunderous so attack (91:14 - 91:20)
was not needed and if he was hit with (91:17 - 91:22)
confused Ray (91:20 - 91:23)
um which would probably come from a (91:22 - 91:25)
hurricane not a confused Ray hurricane (91:23 - 91:28)
pretty common move in VGC or if he was (91:25 - 91:29)
hit with Foul Play it would do more (91:28 - 91:31)
damage because his attack set was just (91:29 - 91:33)
higher so that's why you would want to (91:31 - 91:35)
lower it but since my thunderous is a (91:33 - 91:37)
perfect attack I caught it with perfect (91:35 - 91:39)
attack because it was guaranteed three (91:37 - 91:41)
perfect stats one of them happened to be (91:39 - 91:42)
attack (91:41 - 91:45)
I have no way of lowering that (91:42 - 91:48)
so (91:45 - 91:49)
I don't think there was a lot of (91:48 - 91:53)
enamorouses so anamorous is (91:49 - 91:56)
the hardest competitive Pokemon to get (91:53 - 91:59)
it's only in one game (91:56 - 92:01)
and it's at the end of that game (91:59 - 92:04)
and you can only catch it once (92:01 - 92:06)
and when you move it over (92:04 - 92:08)
that's it if it's not the one you want (92:06 - 92:11)
you have to redo the whole thing now (92:08 - 92:13)
with like something like last year (92:11 - 92:16)
technically it's at the end of the DLC (92:13 - 92:18)
but you can check it in that moment (92:16 - 92:20)
right like as soon as you check it catch (92:18 - 92:22)
it you can check it and then reset (92:20 - 92:24)
enamorous you can't do that (92:22 - 92:27)
and enamorous you want as low as speed (92:24 - 92:29)
as possible because it's a trick room (92:27 - 92:31)
person so that that does give you an (92:29 - 92:33)
advantage (92:31 - 92:35)
um now a really popular Pokemon like (92:33 - 92:37)
urshifu (92:35 - 92:39)
is pretty easy to get honestly like you (92:37 - 92:42)
can get it within two hours of playing (92:39 - 92:45)
the DLC like it's probably one of the (92:42 - 92:48)
easiest Legends to get also if (92:45 - 92:50)
you were wanting to use urshifu I'm (92:48 - 92:52)
assuming you were maybe playing sword (92:50 - 92:53)
and shields you probably have a Nerf (92:52 - 92:55)
Shifu and you can use your older Shifu (92:53 - 92:56)
but maybe you just started with scarlet (92:55 - 92:59)
and violet you didn't have an irishifu (92:56 - 93:01)
um so yeah it's it's a complicated thing (92:59 - 93:02)
but like that's why I was so excited (93:01 - 93:04)
about the Moshi thing (93:02 - 93:05)
um because they have made it easier (93:04 - 93:08)
bottle caps mints (93:05 - 93:09)
um (93:08 - 93:12)
the Moshi stuff like berries vitamins (93:09 - 93:15)
they they have definitely made it easier (93:12 - 93:17)
and (93:15 - 93:19)
it doesn't seem like that mattered it (93:17 - 93:21)
seemed like the people who were (93:19 - 93:24)
Jenning or still Jenning (93:21 - 93:28)
like even though it is is night and day (93:24 - 93:30)
different from black and white X and Y (93:28 - 93:33)
Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire like sword and (93:30 - 93:35)
shield and Beyond (93:33 - 93:39)
just so much easier to build the team (93:35 - 93:41)
but there are there are a lot of players (93:39 - 93:45)
that they don't care about the game part (93:41 - 93:46)
of the like they they don't care about (93:45 - 93:48)
the story they don't care about seeing (93:46 - 93:50)
the Elite Four they they don't care (93:48 - 93:51)
about customizing their trainer I get (93:50 - 93:53)
that there's like (93:51 - 93:55)
if Fiji sees their thing VGC is their (93:53 - 93:58)
thing but (93:55 - 93:58)
it is easier to build Pokemon but it's (94:00 - 94:04)
still not as easy (94:02 - 94:07)
yeah as it could be I guess I don't know (94:04 - 94:10)
everything is easier yeah and as long as (94:07 - 94:12)
yeah Pokemon literally 90 seconds (94:10 - 94:14)
probably less yeah you know (94:12 - 94:17)
especially with Terror types they still (94:14 - 94:18)
haven't announced a way to do that (94:17 - 94:21)
faster yet (94:18 - 94:21)
yeah I I don't know I feel like (94:25 - 94:32)
I don't know it would be nice if they (94:29 - 94:34)
had at us (94:32 - 94:38)
a way to do that customization in game (94:34 - 94:40)
like you catch it in game and then (94:38 - 94:42)
there's a way like through the bottle (94:40 - 94:45)
cap system but like into like an (94:42 - 94:47)
additional thing where you would spend (94:45 - 94:49)
like a platinum bottle cap and you could (94:47 - 94:51)
set where you wanted the ivies or (94:49 - 94:53)
whatever like (94:51 - 94:57)
to help eliminate it but again there's (94:53 - 94:57)
there's not there's never going to be a (94:57 - 95:01)
great answer right like it's just it is (94:58 - 95:03)
just doing what you can (95:01 - 95:05)
yep (95:03 - 95:09)
and there's the the other side of like (95:05 - 95:09)
If These people aren't banned (95:12 - 95:17)
or if the rules aren't enforced it's (95:14 - 95:19)
like well why would I bother even doing (95:17 - 95:20)
it they're not enforcing it I'll just (95:19 - 95:23)
continue jetting (95:20 - 95:23)
so it's like which has happened and (95:24 - 95:27)
that's why (95:26 - 95:29)
that's why this happened so much this (95:27 - 95:31)
year they have to put their foot down at (95:29 - 95:33)
some point right it's like peeling off a (95:31 - 95:36)
Band-Aid there's not a good way to (95:33 - 95:37)
it's not never going to be a perfect (95:36 - 95:39)
time to do it again I don't know the (95:37 - 95:41)
head judge situation a lot of Pokemon (95:39 - 95:43)
appealing off Band-Aids this year (95:41 - 95:46)
sure is I don't know the Black Box (95:43 - 95:48)
situation like don't know if the box is (95:46 - 95:50)
better don't know if (95:48 - 95:53)
the hack checks are better I don't know (95:50 - 95:54)
if that is something they're working on (95:53 - 95:57)
or they have been working on if you go (95:54 - 95:59)
into Pokemon home there's like a notice (95:57 - 96:01)
of like we'll remove Pokemon (95:59 - 96:03)
I I (96:01 - 96:05)
I know people are annoyed that they're (96:03 - 96:07)
getting (96:05 - 96:09)
zashian.net traded I don't even know (96:07 - 96:10)
what the website is anymore they keep (96:09 - 96:14)
changing it oh it changes.net (96:10 - 96:14)
like if you get a Wonder traded Pokemon (96:15 - 96:18)
as a website I guarantee you they're (96:16 - 96:22)
just they just want to sell you more (96:18 - 96:22)
uh yeah (96:24 - 96:29)
um hey there's a fist fight that (96:27 - 96:32)
happened over a skateboard that was that (96:29 - 96:35)
was something that was wild (96:32 - 96:35)
but it sounds like yeah (96:36 - 96:40)
uh (96:39 - 96:42)
just the other thing I was wondering is (96:40 - 96:44)
that in general it did seem like (96:42 - 96:45)
everything was kind of more put together (96:44 - 96:47)
than you expected it to be (96:45 - 96:50)
or no (96:47 - 96:51)
um (96:50 - 96:53)
just the non-comm excessive aspects (96:51 - 96:57)
I think the Excel sender for London was (96:53 - 97:00)
a better venue there is something about (96:57 - 97:03)
walking into that venue and (97:00 - 97:07)
having like stadium seating to watch (97:03 - 97:10)
on this huge stage like the battles like (97:07 - 97:13)
you were in like actual cloth Stadium (97:10 - 97:16)
like almost movie theater like seats and (97:13 - 97:17)
it held a lot of people there was none (97:16 - 97:19)
of that here it was just chairs on the (97:17 - 97:20)
ground because it was a flat Convention (97:19 - 97:22)
Center I mean they opened up with a drum (97:20 - 97:25)
the Japanese drum (97:22 - 97:28)
thing performance that's probably the (97:25 - 97:30)
word which was really cool the (97:28 - 97:33)
production was really good minus (97:30 - 97:34)
um (97:33 - 97:37)
some of the technical stuff (97:34 - 97:41)
uh but that it (97:37 - 97:46)
it felt slightly off (97:41 - 97:46)
but other things made up for it like the (97:46 - 97:51)
Pokemon Center was much better laid out (97:48 - 97:54)
it was a lot wider it was like kind of (97:51 - 97:56)
like an Ikea hallway where you kind of (97:54 - 97:57)
had to go through everything to get to (97:56 - 98:00)
the end versus like this weird maze that (97:57 - 98:02)
was London's and London's was kind of (98:00 - 98:04)
tighter they did have limits right off (98:02 - 98:06)
the bat (98:04 - 98:09)
of like this plushes too (98:06 - 98:13)
um the the deck boxes and the dice they (98:09 - 98:15)
were behind the counter and you had to (98:13 - 98:17)
pick up a card and they were only giving (98:15 - 98:19)
out so many cards in the morning (98:17 - 98:23)
so that wasn't like this people were not (98:19 - 98:24)
running for these items because they (98:23 - 98:26)
were very sought after you they went (98:24 - 98:27)
through the line and asked if people (98:26 - 98:30)
wanted them in the line and gave out (98:27 - 98:31)
cards (98:30 - 98:35)
so like Pokemon Center wise like top (98:31 - 98:36)
tier (98:35 - 98:38)
I mean the nightmare of the situation (98:36 - 98:40)
was just so many people wanted to get in (98:38 - 98:43)
but like the actual organization of it (98:40 - 98:47)
and from what I was told they had triple (98:43 - 98:49)
the amount of product that they had for (98:47 - 98:50)
London (98:49 - 98:51)
um an interesting thing about the (98:50 - 98:54)
Pokemon Center is they had all English (98:51 - 98:56)
cards (98:54 - 99:00)
and there was not a single oh my light (98:56 - 99:02)
died we were talking too long there's (99:00 - 99:05)
not a there was not a single (99:02 - 99:07)
for the for the (99:05 - 99:09)
for the audio listeners I had this light (99:07 - 99:12)
so it wasn't so dark in my room but it (99:09 - 99:14)
just it said two hours we've only well (99:12 - 99:17)
maybe it has been two hours (99:14 - 99:18)
um (99:17 - 99:21)
they only had English cards (99:18 - 99:25)
and so I asked the the (99:21 - 99:27)
Pokemon guy who (99:25 - 99:30)
his name is Stefan who who got me out (99:27 - 99:31)
here and gave me the hotel and (99:30 - 99:33)
everything I was like why is there only (99:31 - 99:35)
English cars were in Japan and he said (99:33 - 99:37)
there's a card drought in Japan right (99:35 - 99:41)
now and they only had English cards they (99:37 - 99:44)
don't have japanese cards and so if you (99:41 - 99:47)
go to a Pokemon Center in Japan (99:44 - 99:50)
there's no cards on the shelves either (99:47 - 99:52)
you can go up to the counter and they (99:50 - 99:55)
will let you buy five booster packs not (99:52 - 99:58)
a box just five individual individual (99:55 - 99:59)
packs but you have to go to the counter (99:58 - 100:03)
and ask and I only sell you five a day (99:59 - 100:05)
um and then I was also told by people (100:03 - 100:08)
who were very into TCG collection that (100:05 - 100:10)
if you went to Akihabara (100:08 - 100:13)
you could get booster boxes and more (100:10 - 100:16)
packs but (100:13 - 100:18)
they like (100:16 - 100:22)
haggle you because the Pokemon company (100:18 - 100:24)
told them they're not (100:22 - 100:26)
allowed to sell more than one box a (100:24 - 100:29)
person but if you have enough money (100:26 - 100:32)
they will sell you as many boxes as you (100:29 - 100:34)
want (100:32 - 100:34)
alrighty then (100:34 - 100:39)
capitalism and that was a real I talked (100:37 - 100:41)
to many people that were like I went in (100:39 - 100:43)
to buy a box and they offered me a (100:41 - 100:46)
second box because I was willing to pay (100:43 - 100:47)
the up (100:46 - 100:50)
cost of the first box so here for an (100:47 - 100:52)
example let's say a box is like 60 bucks (100:50 - 100:54)
because they're smaller boxes in the US (100:52 - 100:57)
they're charging a hundred so if you're (100:54 - 100:59)
willing to buy the boxes a hundred then (100:57 - 101:01)
they know you're serious and they'll put (100:59 - 101:03)
a second box on top and they'll be like (101:01 - 101:06)
we'll sell you both boxes for 200 and (101:03 - 101:08)
then the likes maybe low then if you're (101:06 - 101:10)
willing to buy both boxes they'll put a (101:08 - 101:11)
third box on top and they're like what (101:10 - 101:15)
about like 290 for all three because (101:11 - 101:17)
they want the most profit as possible (101:15 - 101:19)
but they don't want (101:17 - 101:21)
you to know they have multiple boxes (101:19 - 101:23)
without knowing you have (101:21 - 101:26)
the money it's crazy it's like the (101:23 - 101:30)
Pokemon Drought here is crazy (101:26 - 101:30)
what's happening here yep (101:33 - 101:36)
so only English cards I think they sold (101:37 - 101:40)
out for the record I think the English (101:39 - 101:44)
cards did sell (101:40 - 101:44)
although I don't know (101:44 - 101:48)
how into English cards Japanese people (101:48 - 101:52)
are obviously (101:50 - 101:55)
there's a lot of people from Germany in (101:52 - 101:57)
the United States and Canada here so I (101:55 - 102:00)
I I don't know what the I just know they (101:57 - 102:03)
sold out everything sold out (102:00 - 102:07)
that's not too surprising no (102:03 - 102:07)
it was uh (102:09 - 102:14)
I will say that the finals (102:11 - 102:15)
even though I thought the like Masters (102:14 - 102:17)
final was (102:15 - 102:19)
kind of lackluster not the both (102:17 - 102:21)
incredible players it just wasn't as (102:19 - 102:23)
exciting as the the Juniors or the (102:21 - 102:26)
seniors like those are (102:23 - 102:27)
maybe because they they think both went (102:26 - 102:30)
to game three or something (102:27 - 102:32)
um the crowd was out of control they (102:30 - 102:35)
were so hyped they were so excited they (102:32 - 102:37)
were so loud I've never seen a crowd (102:35 - 102:39)
cheer that a gastrodon used to protect (102:37 - 102:41)
before it was (102:39 - 102:46)
it was it was amazing gastroduction (102:41 - 102:50)
yeah around all the time (102:46 - 102:55)
um Pokemon gave me access to Masuda and (102:50 - 102:57)
ishihara signings (102:55 - 103:02)
um I felt gross because well I shouldn't (102:57 - 103:04)
say I felt like they let me cut the line (103:02 - 103:05)
and I was like (103:04 - 103:07)
ah this kind of sucks because these (103:05 - 103:09)
people are waiting and I'm cutting the (103:07 - 103:11)
line but at the same time (103:09 - 103:13)
I was like I don't want to wait this (103:11 - 103:14)
line so I guess at the same time you (103:13 - 103:16)
give them a ton of free advertising for (103:14 - 103:18)
no pay so (103:16 - 103:20)
yeah yeah at the same time immediately (103:18 - 103:21)
after I was done with the line I was (103:20 - 103:23)
like all right we're gonna bust out a (103:21 - 103:24)
YouTube video (103:23 - 103:27)
Okay so (103:24 - 103:27)
um (103:27 - 103:32)
so it was absolutely no phones (103:28 - 103:35)
there was no staged pictures so you can (103:32 - 103:38)
be like Masood a picture (103:35 - 103:39)
um (103:38 - 103:42)
you could not bring your backpack up (103:39 - 103:46)
it had to like stay off the stage they (103:42 - 103:47)
were like your phone cannot come out of (103:46 - 103:50)
your pocket if it does we're exiting you (103:47 - 103:52)
off immediately (103:50 - 103:55)
um you couldn't wear a hat no hats that (103:52 - 103:58)
was a rule uh they enforced that rule (103:55 - 103:59)
you thought you talking about people (103:58 - 104:01)
getting banned for a hat Pokemon you're (103:59 - 104:02)
getting thrown off the stage if you're (104:01 - 104:04)
wearing a hat no hats from a pseudo or a (104:02 - 104:08)
shihara don't know why that was (104:04 - 104:10)
that was a rule (104:08 - 104:13)
um Masuda they both had a translator (104:10 - 104:14)
but (104:13 - 104:17)
Masuda was like (104:14 - 104:18)
the translator was like where are you (104:17 - 104:20)
from is this your first time in Japan (104:18 - 104:22)
how are you enjoying it that was kind of (104:20 - 104:23)
like the gist that they were kind of (104:22 - 104:25)
asking everyone (104:23 - 104:26)
um (104:25 - 104:28)
I was like hey man like I didn't say hey (104:26 - 104:30)
man I was like hey we met in London we (104:28 - 104:33)
talked about cramerant and then he was (104:30 - 104:34)
like ooh ooh because that's crime Rance (104:33 - 104:36)
Japanese name and then we all like (104:34 - 104:39)
laughed because it's a dumb name for a (104:36 - 104:41)
Pokemon in Japanese but like it makes (104:39 - 104:42)
sense because it's supposed to be like (104:41 - 104:45)
the sound of choking uh and that was (104:42 - 104:46)
like kind of Our Moment is like we just (104:45 - 104:48)
laughed about Kramer and then he signed (104:46 - 104:50)
so you couldn't bring them anything to (104:48 - 104:52)
sign they were just signing some (104:50 - 104:53)
postcard (104:52 - 104:56)
which like so many people in line were (104:53 - 104:57)
like talking about like the items they (104:56 - 104:59)
had that they brought and then like as (104:57 - 105:01)
they got closer they still slowly (104:59 - 105:04)
realized that he wasn't signing those (105:01 - 105:06)
items (105:04 - 105:09)
um and then ishihara was like no talking (105:06 - 105:10)
uh (105:09 - 105:12)
the translator was like hey how's it (105:10 - 105:13)
going (105:12 - 105:17)
okay goodbye like (105:13 - 105:17)
Masuda did shake your hand though which (105:18 - 105:21)
was very American (105:20 - 105:24)
um it felt very weird to like (105:21 - 105:27)
shake a Japanese personally because they (105:24 - 105:28)
don't normally do that in their normal (105:27 - 105:31)
like bow but he was very different than (105:28 - 105:34)
last year last year when I met Masuda it (105:31 - 105:37)
was he had to have a mask absolutely no (105:34 - 105:40)
touching him keep it very short (105:37 - 105:43)
uh you did get a picture and video (105:40 - 105:46)
picture was okay to post (105:43 - 105:48)
no posting of your video your video was (105:46 - 105:51)
for personal use so no Instagram no (105:48 - 105:53)
YouTube do not post this video (105:51 - 105:56)
um it was like a very sterile (105:53 - 106:00)
meeting with him but it was like nice (105:56 - 106:02)
um but this he he felt very like yeah (106:00 - 106:04)
I'm shaking hands and I'm signing things (106:02 - 106:07)
and if you had somebody holding your (106:04 - 106:08)
phone like 30 feet away they could take (106:07 - 106:10)
a picture of you and hope it's good (106:08 - 106:12)
because (106:10 - 106:14)
hey (106:12 - 106:16)
I don't know how you do that better like (106:14 - 106:18)
Pokemon's so weird when it comes to (106:16 - 106:22)
their Executives and meeting people and (106:18 - 106:24)
neither of these people speak good (106:22 - 106:28)
English which is fine like that's (106:24 - 106:28)
like their English is not great (106:28 - 106:34)
so I don't I don't know it was an okay (106:30 - 106:36)
experience (106:34 - 106:38)
I'm not a big autographed person so it's (106:36 - 106:38)
like (106:38 - 106:40)
yeah (106:38 - 106:42)
I think meeting them is cool but I (106:40 - 106:44)
didn't like (106:42 - 106:45)
I don't know I've never been an (106:44 - 106:46)
autograph person I know some people are (106:45 - 106:48)
very into that and that's cool for them (106:46 - 106:50)
but it's it's never done anything for me (106:48 - 106:53)
like it's just never been like oh man (106:50 - 106:55)
cool I got (106:53 - 106:58)
Michael Jordan's autograph (106:55 - 106:58)
so I get why they were only signing (107:02 - 107:07)
postcards and not like oh can you please (107:05 - 107:09)
sign my TCG card there's a bunch of (107:07 - 107:11)
vendors out there that I can flip this (107:09 - 107:15)
yeah it gets out of hand real quick (107:11 - 107:19)
[ __ ] I understand (107:15 - 107:19)
um yeah it wasn't it wasn't a complete (107:19 - 107:25)
disaster uh at all uh for some reason (107:21 - 107:26)
actually the venue was laid out very (107:25 - 107:29)
poorly they they put the escalators in (107:26 - 107:32)
certain positions so like you would get (107:29 - 107:33)
to the end of a hallway on the second (107:32 - 107:35)
floor and then realize you couldn't go (107:33 - 107:37)
down because the escalators were only (107:35 - 107:41)
set to up and then they put these like (107:37 - 107:41)
um like plastic chains to like (107:41 - 107:47)
direct like the flow like you can only (107:44 - 107:49)
go like South and you can only go north (107:47 - 107:51)
because the chains are going but like it (107:49 - 107:53)
didn't make sense because if you were (107:51 - 107:54)
going north you'd get to the end of the (107:53 - 107:55)
hallway and be like I can't go down so (107:54 - 107:58)
now I have to go back around so and I (107:55 - 107:59)
was like maybe they're gonna change this (107:58 - 108:01)
the second or third day because this is (107:59 - 108:05)
the this sucks like it's so confusing to (108:01 - 108:07)
be like I'm walking to a dead end and I (108:05 - 108:09)
don't know it till I get there yeah nope (108:07 - 108:11)
they kept it all weekend so like I I (108:09 - 108:15)
guess people learned of like (108:11 - 108:15)
the learner gets stuck was there a map (108:15 - 108:23)
were there good maps no no I also don't (108:19 - 108:24)
know (108:23 - 108:27)
how you would know what was happening so (108:24 - 108:29)
there was one building that was the (108:27 - 108:31)
Pokemon Center (108:29 - 108:33)
and then above that was like the media (108:31 - 108:34)
room (108:33 - 108:38)
and also the line that they were (108:34 - 108:40)
filtering in the Pokemon Center because (108:38 - 108:41)
the Pokemon Center was on the first (108:40 - 108:42)
floor but the line was like technically (108:41 - 108:43)
on the second floor and they would (108:42 - 108:46)
filter you down into it which I guess (108:43 - 108:48)
makes sense it was it was nice in that (108:46 - 108:50)
instant it was nice because those people (108:48 - 108:53)
were in air conditioning so you had to (108:50 - 108:55)
suffer like two hours in the Heat and (108:53 - 108:56)
then you had then you had like an hour (108:55 - 108:59)
of air conditioning that you waited and (108:56 - 109:01)
then you got inside so that was like (108:59 - 109:02)
okay (109:01 - 109:05)
and then the second building was the the (109:02 - 109:07)
hall where the competition was the (109:05 - 109:09)
seating was (109:07 - 109:11)
um they had like a they had a lot of (109:09 - 109:14)
props they had a lot of photo areas they (109:11 - 109:17)
though they had plenty of huge huge (109:14 - 109:18)
monitors projectors they were really (109:17 - 109:20)
high quality projectors and stuff so (109:18 - 109:22)
like Crystal Clear if you weren't (109:20 - 109:23)
sitting close to the stage so that was (109:22 - 109:25)
all beautiful and great (109:23 - 109:28)
um and then they had another building (109:25 - 109:30)
which they didn't really talk about but (109:28 - 109:32)
that building was (109:30 - 109:34)
attached to a hotel was attached to the (109:32 - 109:36)
InterContinental (109:34 - 109:38)
and it was called the it was the (109:36 - 109:42)
conference Hall and in there was (109:38 - 109:47)
um TCG classic so they showed you the (109:42 - 109:50)
board and the deck boxes and then like (109:47 - 109:51)
the (109:50 - 109:53)
plastic magnetic things that were the (109:51 - 109:55)
markers that was really cool and they (109:53 - 109:57)
showed all that but there was no cards (109:55 - 109:59)
they had cards on the wall that you (109:57 - 110:01)
could like take pictures of but they (109:59 - 110:03)
explained the product to you (110:01 - 110:05)
this is gonna be like a 250 product like (110:03 - 110:07)
this is a big fancy one yeah super nice (110:05 - 110:10)
and then they did have people playing (110:07 - 110:12)
the card game like every 30 minutes it (110:10 - 110:13)
was like two Japanese people that would (110:12 - 110:15)
like play through because it comes with (110:13 - 110:17)
three pre-made decks but you weren't (110:15 - 110:20)
allowed to take pictures of those cards (110:17 - 110:22)
so it was like no photos here which I'm (110:20 - 110:24)
assuming maybe they were like they don't (110:22 - 110:26)
want people to take pictures to try to (110:24 - 110:27)
like fake that stuff (110:26 - 110:28)
um (110:27 - 110:31)
then there was like a master's Booth but (110:28 - 110:33)
it was like a AR photo thing so you'd (110:31 - 110:34)
get like a picture of you and it would (110:33 - 110:36)
like put you in the game as like a (110:34 - 110:37)
character it was kind of cool (110:36 - 110:38)
um I didn't do that though and then (110:37 - 110:41)
there was like a Tarot raid area for (110:38 - 110:43)
people (110:41 - 110:44)
um and then there was like a you learn (110:43 - 110:46)
how to play Unite (110:44 - 110:47)
and that was in this booth and then (110:46 - 110:49)
behind it was (110:47 - 110:51)
they had (110:49 - 110:54)
the mascots for the manhole covers they (110:51 - 110:55)
had like Chansey and Geodude and and (110:54 - 110:58)
Psyduck and stuff nice and then (110:55 - 111:00)
sometimes those mascots would show up (110:58 - 111:01)
like Chansey like you could get a (111:00 - 111:02)
picture with Chansey and I was like (111:01 - 111:05)
wobbling through the hallway to like but (111:02 - 111:09)
they also were selling (111:05 - 111:09)
like items that were per the region so (111:09 - 111:17)
like alolan nine tails and Ninetales are (111:14 - 111:20)
in like sapparo they're in the snowy (111:17 - 111:22)
part of Japan (111:20 - 111:24)
I don't remember that but that's where (111:22 - 111:26)
their manhole cover is too so they were (111:24 - 111:29)
like selling rice that was exclusive (111:26 - 111:31)
from that region of Japan so each (111:29 - 111:32)
manhole is representing a different (111:31 - 111:35)
region they had a store that store like (111:32 - 111:37)
sold out very quickly that sounds very (111:35 - 111:40)
Japanese and kind of lovely yeah yeah (111:37 - 111:42)
um but you would never know that place (111:40 - 111:44)
existed (111:42 - 111:45)
because there was no map (111:44 - 111:48)
and I just randomly stumbled upon it and (111:45 - 111:50)
then they had the whole park in the back (111:48 - 111:53)
the the mitsuzuri park or whatever the (111:50 - 111:55)
Japanese festival which was ticketed and (111:53 - 111:57)
then they had the giant boat SSN that (111:55 - 111:59)
you can go on that was ticketed and then (111:57 - 112:01)
they had the sorry I couldn't tell what (111:59 - 112:03)
word you were trying to say it means (112:01 - 112:06)
Festival yes and then they had the mall (112:03 - 112:08)
next to the convention hall and that had (112:06 - 112:12)
the card walk which had every single (112:08 - 112:15)
Pokemon in card form on like all eight (112:12 - 112:17)
floors and they had bigger cards and (112:15 - 112:19)
they had the giant Pikachu that was (112:17 - 112:20)
taking it up and then they had a pop-up (112:19 - 112:23)
Pokemon Center in there and then on the (112:20 - 112:24)
top floor again they didn't tell us this (112:23 - 112:26)
I didn't discover this until the end of (112:24 - 112:28)
the second day on the very top floor (112:26 - 112:30)
they had a Pokemon cafe that they opened (112:28 - 112:33)
and they were doing ice cube pops where (112:30 - 112:35)
it was like Ice Cube and you would lick (112:33 - 112:37)
it and then it would have like the the (112:35 - 112:40)
noise the tiny head and they closed (112:37 - 112:43)
early today on Sunday because they ran (112:40 - 112:46)
out of stuff (112:43 - 112:50)
um but nowhere is it like hey the cafe (112:46 - 112:52)
is on the eighth floor of this giant (112:50 - 112:54)
mall just keep going up up (112:52 - 112:56)
they had a pop-up Pokemon Center in the (112:54 - 112:58)
mall which also sold out and closed (112:56 - 113:00)
every day at six because it was so busy (112:58 - 113:02)
they had photo ops in the mall they had (113:00 - 113:06)
all the artwork like the the Onyx and (113:02 - 113:08)
the Eevee umbrella and the Psyduck (113:06 - 113:11)
umbrella and the tandemouse and a bunch (113:08 - 113:12)
of stuff like the Butterfree wings (113:11 - 113:15)
that's all over that mall (113:12 - 113:17)
they had a drone show every night that (113:15 - 113:18)
was free (113:17 - 113:20)
um (113:18 - 113:22)
I I could keep going they just had so (113:20 - 113:24)
much stuff like when I walked over to (113:22 - 113:26)
the boat today (113:24 - 113:30)
they had wooden Trevenant and like (113:26 - 113:32)
hiding in the bushes and they had all (113:30 - 113:35)
these Pokemon around the SSN and I was (113:32 - 113:37)
like it was a 20 minute walk to get here (113:35 - 113:40)
and you have more Pokemon stuff over (113:37 - 113:42)
like no one would know this because if (113:40 - 113:43)
you didn't have a ticket to the boat you (113:42 - 113:45)
wouldn't come over here and see all (113:43 - 113:47)
these restaurants and everything that (113:45 - 113:49)
was like decked out (113:47 - 113:50)
um so I (113:49 - 113:52)
it's like both a good the like the bad (113:50 - 113:55)
thing is they poorly communicated it but (113:52 - 113:57)
the good thing was like if you didn't (113:55 - 113:59)
know what to do and you just walked in a (113:57 - 114:01)
general direction you would find more (113:59 - 114:03)
things to do (114:01 - 114:05)
so (114:03 - 114:07)
it was cool like when you scanned your (114:05 - 114:09)
little like ticket to get on a train it (114:07 - 114:11)
said Pika that was cool they changed the (114:09 - 114:13)
train tickets (114:11 - 114:15)
um the train stations also had pop-up (114:13 - 114:17)
Pokemon centers and (114:15 - 114:19)
other things to do (114:17 - 114:21)
but I didn't go to the train station (114:19 - 114:24)
because I was like stuck in yoga I got I (114:21 - 114:26)
didn't have to leave Yokohama so I (114:24 - 114:29)
didn't have to go to the train station (114:26 - 114:31)
um but Japanese people like no surprise (114:29 - 114:33)
I guess it's maybe a surprise if you've (114:31 - 114:35)
never been to Japan they love lines (114:33 - 114:38)
they're really good at forming lines (114:35 - 114:40)
um so even like the manhole covers (114:38 - 114:43)
had a line people just got in line to be (114:40 - 114:44)
like okay we're all gonna take pictures (114:43 - 114:46)
of the manhole cover one by one they're (114:44 - 114:47)
very (114:46 - 114:49)
this country is very good at forming (114:47 - 114:50)
lines (114:49 - 114:53)
they're very good at standing in lines (114:50 - 114:56)
America not America does not know what (114:53 - 114:59)
single file is (114:56 - 114:59)
somebody who needed to get in multiple (115:00 - 115:05)
lines when the Pokemon company was (115:02 - 115:07)
busting us around this country (115:05 - 115:09)
Americans do not know what single file (115:07 - 115:11)
is (115:09 - 115:11)
able to just have Pokemon all over like (115:13 - 115:17)
that even if it was a little bit (115:15 - 115:19)
not well communicated (115:17 - 115:23)
a good map a good map would have helped (115:19 - 115:23)
maybe there was Maps but they maybe they (115:24 - 115:30)
ran out I don't know like I don't even (115:28 - 115:31)
know where to get maps there were some (115:30 - 115:33)
lines I didn't know what the line was (115:31 - 115:35)
for I had no clue like outside the (115:33 - 115:37)
convention center there was a tent where (115:35 - 115:39)
people were lining up I have no clue (115:37 - 115:41)
where they were going I don't know where (115:39 - 115:42)
they were going I don't know what they (115:41 - 115:44)
were doing there was nothing to signify (115:42 - 115:46)
what they were waiting in line for the (115:44 - 115:48)
line just came and went they disappeared (115:46 - 115:50)
into the The Ether I don't know (115:48 - 115:51)
they were just gone (115:50 - 115:55)
I have no clue (115:51 - 115:55)
um oh they did a go thing as well (115:55 - 115:59)
different this year so when you bought (115:57 - 116:02)
your spectator pass or you picked up (115:59 - 116:05)
your competitor bass you got a you got a (116:02 - 116:07)
code that you would have to redeem and (116:05 - 116:09)
Redeeming the code would make the spawns (116:07 - 116:11)
happen (116:09 - 116:13)
and they were geofenced as well so not (116:11 - 116:16)
only did you need a code you had to be (116:13 - 116:18)
within the fence (116:16 - 116:21)
so my hotel (116:18 - 116:23)
for the record I did not pay for was (116:21 - 116:25)
connected to the building of the Pokemon (116:23 - 116:28)
Center which was then one building away (116:25 - 116:30)
from the expo hall which was then one (116:28 - 116:33)
building away from the convention hall (116:30 - 116:36)
in my hotel I could not see any of the (116:33 - 116:38)
stops any of the gyms any of the Pokemon (116:36 - 116:40)
and I would literally walk out of my (116:38 - 116:41)
hotel and walk four feet and then they (116:40 - 116:44)
would all spawn in hmm (116:41 - 116:46)
so like I couldn't invite people to (116:44 - 116:47)
Pikachu raids (116:46 - 116:51)
because those raids didn't exist on the (116:47 - 116:54)
map for them so it would just error out (116:51 - 116:56)
so Niantic (116:54 - 116:59)
ticketed it well it was free you just (116:56 - 117:00)
had to have a spectator passing an enter (116:59 - 117:04)
code and then on top of the geofenced it (117:00 - 117:06)
so you couldn't like I couldn't just (117:04 - 117:07)
like give you the code hand and be like (117:06 - 117:10)
all right like yeah I mean it sounds (117:07 - 117:11)
like that's kind of what they do for go (117:10 - 117:14)
fests too (117:11 - 117:14)
you don't always have a code but you (117:16 - 117:20)
need to have bought the thing for (117:18 - 117:21)
Seattle (117:20 - 117:23)
go fast you could be pretty far away and (117:21 - 117:26)
still see all the spawns in the park but (117:23 - 117:27)
I guess they would turn off (117:26 - 117:30)
I've definitely seen some go Fest or at (117:27 - 117:32)
least some YouTubers who have walked (117:30 - 117:34)
outside of a geofence and had everything (117:32 - 117:37)
disappear yeah well I guess go Fest now (117:34 - 117:39)
or like four geofenced areas so things (117:37 - 117:41)
get weird when you're like Crossing that (117:39 - 117:44)
line from like volcanic sulfur to that (117:41 - 117:47)
electric sheep or whatever weird names (117:44 - 117:50)
they decide to take (117:47 - 117:50)
um so yeah the the go Fest thing was or (117:52 - 117:57)
the the go event was cool (117:54 - 117:59)
they had a lot of giveaways and (117:57 - 118:01)
distributions (117:59 - 118:01)
um (118:01 - 118:05)
yeah it's like weird to have such a big (118:01 - 118:09)
Pokemon event and then just be like (118:05 - 118:11)
I'm never in the convention hall to (118:09 - 118:13)
watch any of these matches because like (118:11 - 118:16)
I'm doing it also the community day was (118:13 - 118:18)
like during finals (118:16 - 118:21)
and did you guys get like a quest line (118:18 - 118:23)
that was like it hasn't happened here (118:21 - 118:26)
yet oh yeah so we got a quest line that (118:23 - 118:29)
was you know how it's under (118:26 - 118:31)
like The Limited one that's like timed (118:29 - 118:32)
and if you don't do it it's gone forever (118:31 - 118:33)
and then there's like the special like (118:32 - 118:35)
when you pay the dollar you get it (118:33 - 118:37)
forever right like catch five frokey (118:35 - 118:40)
then catch 10 more frokey (118:37 - 118:42)
we got one that was (118:40 - 118:46)
like six steps and every step just gave (118:42 - 118:47)
you it was like catch three Pokemon (118:46 - 118:49)
catch three Pokemon with berries (118:47 - 118:51)
um the spin three pokestops and it was (118:49 - 118:53)
like six steps of all those and it just (118:51 - 118:55)
gave you froakies so I don't know if (118:53 - 118:58)
they gave that to us because they knew (118:55 - 119:00)
we weren't gonna like leave the hall (118:58 - 119:03)
or if that was always planned (119:00 - 119:06)
but no other community has had this hmm (119:03 - 119:08)
but they were all just Froakie I didn't (119:06 - 119:09)
finish it because I was like I don't (119:08 - 119:11)
need any (119:09 - 119:11)
yeah the one dollar pass is often a lot (119:12 - 119:18)
like that but that sounds like something (119:15 - 119:21)
specifically yeah it's free and gave you (119:18 - 119:23)
way better rewards than the one dollar (119:21 - 119:25)
pass like it gave you a thousand (119:23 - 119:27)
Stardust and a bunch of other stuff (119:25 - 119:29)
every like set you completed and there (119:27 - 119:32)
were six sets (119:29 - 119:32)
um (119:32 - 119:38)
Community during finals was (119:34 - 119:40)
it was bad it was a bad decision (119:38 - 119:42)
yep especially I'm such a popular (119:40 - 119:44)
Pokemon (119:42 - 119:48)
it was also they were giving I don't (119:44 - 119:49)
have it I wish I had it they were giving (119:48 - 119:52)
out wristbands that had lights on them (119:49 - 119:55)
and they ran out (119:52 - 119:58)
and then randomly they got more and they (119:55 - 120:00)
gave me one and from my understanding (119:58 - 120:04)
they lit up depending on what match was (120:00 - 120:09)
happening so if like if if tcg's matches (120:04 - 120:10)
were on the screen it would like light (120:09 - 120:13)
up blue and it was VGC it would light up (120:10 - 120:14)
red and then if it was go it would light (120:13 - 120:17)
up green (120:14 - 120:17)
and I when I walked out of the (120:17 - 120:21)
convention it stopped working and then (120:19 - 120:23)
it never worked again but then I was at (120:21 - 120:25)
a restaurant after everything was over (120:23 - 120:27)
and like other peoples were still lit up (120:25 - 120:29)
and I was like I don't know what I did (120:27 - 120:32)
wrong yeah Brian's not lighting up (120:29 - 120:35)
anymore also somebody handed this to me (120:32 - 120:38)
and never explained what it did or why I (120:35 - 120:40)
should wear it that's the theme of the (120:38 - 120:42)
whole convention I guess theme of (120:40 - 120:44)
everything it's like no one knows what's (120:42 - 120:47)
happening and it's not because of a (120:44 - 120:49)
language barrier it's just legitimately (120:47 - 120:52)
no one knows what's happening (120:49 - 120:52)
Pokemon everywhere (120:53 - 120:56)
everywhere I traded with some old ladies (121:00 - 121:04)
they were very happy to get Buffalo (121:01 - 121:07)
you got to finish the clone Pokemon I'm (121:04 - 121:08)
envious of that (121:07 - 121:11)
yeah I also learned uh this weekend uh (121:08 - 121:13)
because I posted that on Instagram that (121:11 - 121:14)
people didn't know clone Pokemon were in (121:13 - 121:17)
the game that was like it was a busy (121:14 - 121:19)
five years ago no it was at the very (121:17 - 121:21)
beginning of the (121:19 - 121:21)
yeah it was Charizard Venusaur Blastoise (121:27 - 121:32)
and Pikachu (121:29 - 121:32)
did they have the Clone Pikachu yeah (121:33 - 121:37)
no clone Pikachu couldn't be shiny from (121:41 - 121:44)
my understanding (121:43 - 121:46)
I think they were I think all these were (121:44 - 121:47)
shiny elect (121:46 - 121:48)
but maybe I could be wrong somebody (121:47 - 121:50)
could correct me but I guess I would (121:48 - 121:52)
need a shiny clone Pikachu if that was a (121:50 - 121:54)
real thing (121:52 - 121:56)
I'm unsure on that (121:54 - 121:59)
it could be (121:56 - 122:01)
yeah this was (121:59 - 122:03)
there are too many too many costume (122:01 - 122:06)
Pikachu oh there are (122:03 - 122:08)
yep (122:06 - 122:10)
uh I don't know about the shiny but it's (122:08 - 122:13)
in there (122:10 - 122:13)
um okay so after worlds they announced (122:15 - 122:21)
that (122:18 - 122:24)
uh miascarata mimikyu and Blaziken are (122:21 - 122:27)
coming to Pokemon unite so Greg give me (122:24 - 122:30)
your thoughts I called me oscarata just (122:27 - 122:33)
for the record that's true uh (122:30 - 122:36)
they're interesting according to the (122:33 - 122:39)
backgrounds that they showed in the (122:36 - 122:41)
preview because all the backgrounds mean (122:39 - 122:45)
the role both Blaziken and mimikyu are (122:41 - 122:50)
all rounders and music is a Speedster (122:45 - 122:53)
um so (122:50 - 122:56)
we have a lot of all-rounders like (122:53 - 122:59)
Mewtwo is an all-rounder so I'm not (122:56 - 123:01)
really sure what's going to set these (122:59 - 123:03)
apart (123:01 - 123:04)
um because they didn't give a whole lot (123:03 - 123:06)
of information they kind of showed the (123:04 - 123:08)
cool things that they do (123:06 - 123:10)
um they're just three popular Pokemon (123:08 - 123:12)
yeah they're just pretty popular Pokemon (123:10 - 123:14)
and I'm sure I'm sure they'll be fine (123:12 - 123:16)
like it's exciting to see them in it's (123:14 - 123:17)
always fun when you get new ones (123:16 - 123:19)
hopefully they won't be broken like (123:17 - 123:21)
Mewtwo still is (123:19 - 123:23)
no new map (123:21 - 123:26)
not announced yet everybody is expecting (123:23 - 123:27)
it to come but they haven't announced a (123:26 - 123:32)
new map so maybe not this year (123:27 - 123:34)
huh they didn't announce it that I've (123:32 - 123:37)
seen (123:34 - 123:37)
yeah I mean like (123:38 - 123:42)
normally what they announce at Worlds is (123:39 - 123:45)
a bit competitive Focus so announcing (123:42 - 123:49)
three Pokemon for unite makes sense yeah (123:45 - 123:53)
for TCG they showed off uh ancient and (123:49 - 123:56)
future Pokemon uh around the Paradox (123:53 - 123:58)
Pokemon (123:56 - 124:00)
this to me seemed very similar to when (123:58 - 124:04)
they introduced rapid strike and was the (124:00 - 124:06)
other one like single strike yeah (124:04 - 124:09)
um which (124:06 - 124:11)
certain cards benefited rapid certain (124:09 - 124:15)
abilities benefited single uh so (124:11 - 124:19)
there's not a lot of paradox Pokemon so (124:15 - 124:19)
it's whatever it's like the next gimmick (124:19 - 124:23)
it's fine (124:21 - 124:25)
and then they announced and they made a (124:23 - 124:26)
big deal about this that they bring (124:25 - 124:30)
about Ace spec cards and uh you very (124:26 - 124:32)
quickly when that those those words are (124:30 - 124:33)
said (124:32 - 124:36)
figure out who has or has not played the (124:33 - 124:38)
TCG because if you have played the TCG (124:36 - 124:39)
for a while you know exactly what those (124:38 - 124:42)
are and if you haven't you're like why (124:39 - 124:43)
is this a big deal because they made it (124:42 - 124:44)
a big deal (124:43 - 124:48)
um and so a spec cards are (124:44 - 124:51)
very powerful cards that you're only (124:48 - 124:53)
allowed one in your deck (124:51 - 124:57)
and they are TR they are item based so (124:53 - 124:59)
there are (124:57 - 125:00)
um (124:59 - 125:04)
there are like radiant cards so like (125:00 - 125:06)
radiant Greninja you can only play one (125:04 - 125:08)
of those (125:06 - 125:11)
because it's a radiant card but that's a (125:08 - 125:14)
Pokemon so these are items so a good a a (125:11 - 125:16)
good um old aspect card would be master (125:14 - 125:18)
ball you can only have one Master Ball (125:16 - 125:20)
in your deck and obviously it got you (125:18 - 125:22)
any Pokemon you wanted (125:20 - 125:25)
like it's very powerful or (125:22 - 125:27)
um there was like computer search which (125:25 - 125:28)
was very popular in black and white (125:27 - 125:30)
almost aspects were around like the (125:28 - 125:32)
black and white time which was like (125:30 - 125:35)
discard two cards and get any card in (125:32 - 125:37)
your deck you want which was you know an (125:35 - 125:38)
equivalent to that would be like Ultra (125:37 - 125:40)
Ball Ultra Balls Like discard two cards (125:38 - 125:42)
but get any Pokemon you want this is (125:40 - 125:44)
discard two cards and get any any card (125:42 - 125:45)
you want (125:44 - 125:47)
um dowsing machine was like another one (125:45 - 125:50)
so again it's (125:47 - 125:52)
you can have one a spec not one of each (125:50 - 125:54)
aspect just one a spec in your deck (125:52 - 125:58)
period And so you have to pick between (125:54 - 126:00)
I think there was like eight or nine a (125:58 - 126:01)
spec Back in Black and White so you pick (126:00 - 126:03)
which of the nine there's no reason not (126:01 - 126:05)
to have one because they're so good so (126:03 - 126:08)
like every deck has one a spec (126:05 - 126:08)
um (126:08 - 126:09)
obviously you probably wouldn't have (126:08 - 126:12)
like a radiant Greninja if you were (126:09 - 126:13)
playing like a fire deck there would be (126:12 - 126:15)
like no benefits (126:13 - 126:17)
[Music] (126:15 - 126:19)
um so TCG that was like pretty exciting (126:17 - 126:21)
and really good (126:19 - 126:22)
um and I have more TCG stuff because (126:21 - 126:23)
I've met with creatures but we'll do (126:22 - 126:25)
that in a future episode (126:23 - 126:29)
and then for the video game (126:25 - 126:32)
they showed a lot of priority moves (126:29 - 126:34)
they're like everything's just going (126:32 - 126:37)
first yep (126:34 - 126:37)
but they also can't remember where the (126:40 - 126:43)
electric one was called (126:42 - 126:45)
oh (126:43 - 126:46)
but (126:45 - 126:49)
um it one shot a deliber or the iron (126:46 - 126:51)
bundle which is like kind of big because (126:49 - 126:53)
iron bundle right now is the fastest (126:51 - 126:56)
Pokemon in the meta although I don't (126:53 - 126:57)
know how many we saw this past weekend (126:56 - 126:59)
but like (126:57 - 127:01)
it's faster than reggiela key (126:59 - 127:03)
um so having a (127:01 - 127:06)
they purposely showed off (127:03 - 127:09)
hey look at this Pokemon one shot a (127:06 - 127:11)
deliber or iron bottle and it was faster (127:09 - 127:13)
because it was priority like that was (127:11 - 127:14)
very purposeful (127:13 - 127:15)
um (127:14 - 127:18)
and they gave (127:15 - 127:21)
the weird cobal of King kobalian the (127:18 - 127:23)
double kick steel move which obviously (127:21 - 127:25)
gets through mimikyu's disguise which (127:23 - 127:28)
again another intentional kind of thing (127:25 - 127:30)
um and then (127:28 - 127:33)
they showed all the starter Pokemon (127:30 - 127:34)
yes (127:33 - 127:36)
if you have a favorite starter that's (127:34 - 127:38)
not in the game yet it's gonna be in (127:36 - 127:41)
there with the DLC I'm finally gonna get (127:38 - 127:44)
to bring my Blaziken back in I'm happy I (127:41 - 127:49)
get to catch everything in a luxury ball (127:44 - 127:49)
I saw people saying like this is the (127:50 - 127:53)
first time you can catch wild starters (127:51 - 127:56)
that they not play Let's go or (127:53 - 127:59)
Legends or (127:56 - 128:01)
bdspace (127:59 - 128:06)
or like sun and moon where they were in (128:01 - 128:09)
that QR code thing I guess those are not (128:06 - 128:11)
in the wild but (128:09 - 128:14)
they appeared (128:11 - 128:14)
hey starters starters sell sell copies (128:15 - 128:21)
that was they (128:18 - 128:22)
have been working on getting all the (128:21 - 128:24)
ribbons on my Blaze can my Blaziken is (128:22 - 128:27)
my oldest Pokemon I have had her since (128:24 - 128:29)
Ruby and I'm like excited to bring her (128:27 - 128:33)
back up to the newest game it's awesome (128:29 - 128:33)
uh uh what else did they show in that (128:34 - 128:38)
trailer (128:36 - 128:40)
starters was the big thing and then the (128:38 - 128:42)
new Tara thing the Tara (128:40 - 128:45)
rainbow Tara we don't know what it is (128:42 - 128:47)
yet (128:45 - 128:51)
yeah the ninth the 19th Tara (128:47 - 128:51)
um (128:51 - 128:54)
I guess if I'm (128:52 - 128:57)
going to speculate (128:54 - 128:57)
I I I think it could be like two things (128:58 - 129:02)
but I think I think the second one is (129:01 - 129:04)
more likely I could be completely wrong (129:02 - 129:05)
which is totally cool too I don't (129:04 - 129:08)
whatever I'm okay with being wrong the (129:05 - 129:13)
first is I think it could work like (129:08 - 129:16)
protein which is greninja's Cinderella's (129:13 - 129:19)
ability where you hit it (129:16 - 129:21)
and then it will lock into like one of (129:19 - 129:23)
your so for example if you like throat (129:21 - 129:27)
chop a quick attack and flare Blitz if (129:23 - 129:28)
you hit flare boats first you're looking (129:27 - 129:30)
to lock into fire that doesn't make like (129:28 - 129:32)
a lot of sense because you would still (129:30 - 129:33)
have to hit the trash lies button it (129:32 - 129:38)
would make sense the turn afterwards (129:33 - 129:38)
I think the thing that might be more (129:38 - 129:42)
likely but again I'm probably wrong is (129:39 - 129:45)
that this Terra is only super effective (129:42 - 129:48)
against that same Terra (129:45 - 129:52)
so you lose all of your weaknesses (129:48 - 129:56)
all together and you're only weak to the (129:52 - 129:58)
rainbow Terra (129:56 - 129:58)
so if I'm like gastrodon (130:02 - 130:07)
and I'm weak to grass (130:05 - 130:09)
and if I go water I'm still weak to (130:07 - 130:10)
grass (130:09 - 130:12)
and if I go fire (130:10 - 130:14)
well I'm not fire is a bad example (130:12 - 130:16)
because now they would use a water type (130:14 - 130:18)
move but I would water absorb it but if (130:16 - 130:20)
I went electric I'm not weak to ground (130:18 - 130:23)
but if I go rainbow Terra I'm not weak (130:20 - 130:25)
to anything except other people going (130:23 - 130:28)
rainbow Terra (130:25 - 130:28)
Maybe (130:30 - 130:34)
yeah (130:31 - 130:34)
like yeah there was one (130:36 - 130:42)
screenshot that they showed of it that (130:39 - 130:43)
was a backs caliber (130:42 - 130:46)
yes (130:43 - 130:47)
but that didn't give (130:46 - 130:50)
too much but that did give I think (130:47 - 130:52)
information because a little Excalibur (130:50 - 130:55)
had a dragon type move so dragon is (130:52 - 130:56)
super effective against it was (130:55 - 130:58)
backscalibur versus Dragonite so back (130:56 - 131:00)
Excalibur had like Dragon Rush that (130:58 - 131:02)
would be super effective and it shows (131:00 - 131:03)
that it's super effective and then it (131:02 - 131:06)
has icicle crash which is also super (131:03 - 131:09)
effective but when the the rainbow Terra (131:06 - 131:12)
was not super effective it was just (131:09 - 131:13)
normal (131:12 - 131:15)
so (131:13 - 131:17)
if it was Dr if it was Dragon it would (131:15 - 131:18)
have been super effective it was ice it (131:17 - 131:19)
would have been super effective it was (131:18 - 131:20)
fairy it would have been super effective (131:19 - 131:22)
so if it's supposed to be every type why (131:20 - 131:24)
is it not super effective so is it only (131:22 - 131:27)
super effective against its own type (131:24 - 131:27)
so I think that does I don't know (131:28 - 131:33)
but also he didn't hit the button yet (131:31 - 131:37)
yeah so like yeah this is (131:33 - 131:40)
that Terror also supposed to be with the (131:37 - 131:42)
masks like do you have to have like (131:40 - 131:45)
holding a mask item in order to hit that (131:42 - 131:46)
button but then it's like you also have (131:45 - 131:48)
to have the Terra and then the hell item (131:46 - 131:49)
which (131:48 - 131:50)
doesn't make a lot of sense because they (131:49 - 131:52)
wanted to get away with that with like Z (131:50 - 131:55)
moves (131:52 - 131:55)
uh I don't know (131:57 - 132:02)
Tara is a little bit more involved than (132:00 - 132:04)
I expected it to be I don't I I didn't (132:02 - 132:07)
expect it to go much beyond the Tariff (132:04 - 132:08)
forms that we had kind of been (132:07 - 132:10)
speculating about (132:08 - 132:15)
this is new yeah uh the tarapagos and (132:10 - 132:17)
ogrepon have different forms when they (132:15 - 132:20)
trust oh yeah yeah yeah (132:17 - 132:20)
um so yeah I mean (132:22 - 132:26)
it was a pretty short trailer but like (132:25 - 132:29)
the the starter Pokemon and the second (132:26 - 132:31)
or the rainbow Terra isn't coming until (132:29 - 132:34)
the second DLC right (132:31 - 132:37)
so (132:34 - 132:39)
we have time to speculate get your (132:37 - 132:41)
answers in now none of the fun stuff is (132:39 - 132:45)
coming till the second DLC (132:41 - 132:48)
Get Wrecked first DLC sorry new Pokemon (132:45 - 132:52)
hey diplin you're garbage hey sample (132:48 - 132:55)
remover you're also garbage (132:52 - 132:55)
um we didn't say this but I think uh you (132:58 - 133:02)
know this is the first tournament where (133:01 - 133:04)
there was no practicing there was no (133:02 - 133:05)
tournaments before that it was like a (133:04 - 133:07)
brand new format I think it went (133:05 - 133:09)
actually better than I would have ever (133:07 - 133:12)
imagined there were so many unique teams (133:09 - 133:16)
um and there was so much variety and (133:12 - 133:18)
at least being there and hearing the (133:16 - 133:21)
crowd it was probably the most I I could (133:18 - 133:23)
have just been Japan who knows it just (133:21 - 133:26)
seemed like people were very into (133:23 - 133:28)
um like there was a sneezler team that (133:26 - 133:29)
did really well there was the Articuno (133:28 - 133:31)
team and Obama Snow that did really well (133:29 - 133:34)
there was a Breloom that people were (133:31 - 133:36)
like overly excited for usually like I (133:34 - 133:38)
feel like at past tournaments there was (133:36 - 133:39)
only like one of those teams that stand (133:38 - 133:42)
out but it felt like there's a bramble (133:39 - 133:43)
guess that was like killing it for a (133:42 - 133:45)
while that people were like very excited (133:43 - 133:48)
for the Bramble guess it just felt like (133:45 - 133:51)
like even if you look at the finals (133:48 - 133:53)
like the the guy who came in second (133:51 - 133:55)
which (133:53 - 133:56)
like (133:55 - 133:58)
I don't know I kind of wish there was a (133:56 - 133:59)
game three to that but the guy who came (133:58 - 134:00)
in second had a dragon pulp and a (133:59 - 134:04)
ferrigo RAF like it was like what you (134:00 - 134:06)
made it to finals of the photograph like (134:04 - 134:10)
that's so cool uh (134:06 - 134:10)
and now we're gonna get like a namunga's (134:10 - 134:13)
distribution because the guy who won had (134:12 - 134:14)
a new Mungus and I was like the only (134:13 - 134:15)
Pokemon (134:14 - 134:18)
it's like her 14th amongus among is a (134:15 - 134:21)
gastrodon just always winning (134:18 - 134:24)
um it was it was it was good I don't (134:21 - 134:24)
know (134:24 - 134:26)
worlds is good it was not the disaster I (134:24 - 134:28)
thought it was but there was a lot of (134:26 - 134:30)
like (134:28 - 134:31)
I feel like the points that would have (134:30 - 134:33)
been super weak were just (134:31 - 134:36)
countered with like here's more Pokemon (134:33 - 134:38)
things to distract you yeah and if this (134:36 - 134:40)
was like any other worlds (134:38 - 134:42)
like if I applied all of these problems (134:40 - 134:45)
to like a DC or an Asheville it would (134:42 - 134:47)
have been a disaster because they didn't (134:45 - 134:49)
have anything else to do (134:47 - 134:51)
uh yeah (134:49 - 134:53)
but then when they drowned you with a (134:51 - 134:55)
million activities in a million events (134:53 - 134:57)
and Everywhere You Look is Pokemon it's (134:55 - 134:59)
like that's not that big of a deal yeah (134:57 - 135:01)
I don't know if I expect to see this (134:59 - 135:03)
many Pokemon events at Future worlds but (135:01 - 135:05)
they have been ramping it up each year (135:03 - 135:08)
DC didn't have that much they had some (135:05 - 135:10)
cardboard cutouts and stuff to pose with (135:08 - 135:12)
that movie you could go see and then (135:10 - 135:14)
London last year (135:12 - 135:16)
London last year had a whole bunch had (135:14 - 135:19)
uh some decorations around the city had (135:16 - 135:22)
the lifts with the Pokemon on them and (135:19 - 135:23)
then this year there's just Pokemon (135:22 - 135:25)
everywhere (135:23 - 135:28)
yeah and so don't know how that's going (135:25 - 135:32)
to transition into Hawaii which is (135:28 - 135:34)
their (135:32 - 135:39)
their third time fourth time going back (135:34 - 135:41)
they like Hawaii they like Hawaii for a (135:39 - 135:44)
lot of reasons it's (135:41 - 135:46)
in between Japan and America their two (135:44 - 135:48)
most popular countries (135:46 - 135:50)
um (135:48 - 135:53)
if you watch my reaction I said I think (135:50 - 135:55)
it's going to be Hawaii and I don't want (135:53 - 135:57)
it to be Hawaii (135:55 - 136:02)
and then it was Hawaii mm-hmm (135:57 - 136:02)
so (136:02 - 136:07)
uh not to anyone's fault but there is a (136:03 - 136:10)
disaster happening in Hawaii right now (136:07 - 136:11)
well maybe it is somebody's fault I (136:10 - 136:12)
actually don't know that but I don't (136:11 - 136:14)
know like (136:12 - 136:17)
you know the Pokemon company didn't no (136:14 - 136:18)
one planned for this to happen right the (136:17 - 136:21)
announcement of Hawaii during a disaster (136:18 - 136:23)
that's happening in Hawaii right now (136:21 - 136:24)
um (136:23 - 136:29)
it sucks uh not great (136:24 - 136:29)
the cool thing is and I don't know (136:29 - 136:34)
you know the Pokemon company has been (136:32 - 136:35)
pretty generous the last couple years (136:34 - 136:37)
with like black lives matters and a (136:35 - 136:38)
couple other (136:37 - 136:41)
organizations in between (136:38 - 136:43)
uh they (136:41 - 136:45)
said they were donating (136:43 - 136:47)
250 000 (136:45 - 136:50)
to or is it two hundred thousand two (136:47 - 136:53)
hundred thousand it's a lot of zeros (136:50 - 136:56)
um to Hawaii for their causes and then (136:53 - 136:57)
they announced it was Hawaii they had (136:56 - 137:00)
Pikachu on a beach and that was kind of (136:57 - 137:01)
it (137:00 - 137:04)
I can tell you at least (137:01 - 137:06)
in the venue (137:04 - 137:09)
uh everyone was excited and I don't know (137:06 - 137:11)
if that was the energy of just coming (137:09 - 137:13)
off a world championship and then you (137:11 - 137:16)
look at social media and everyone was a (137:13 - 137:18)
you know upset (137:16 - 137:20)
there are a few different things to be (137:18 - 137:22)
upset about yeah I mean that's like (137:20 - 137:24)
saying everybody's always excited for (137:22 - 137:26)
the new phone iPhone at the Apple yeah (137:24 - 137:29)
event and then social media comes in (137:26 - 137:31)
people who aren't huge fans of it are (137:29 - 137:32)
like yeah (137:31 - 137:35)
[Music] (137:32 - 137:35)
Hawaii is a choice (137:37 - 137:40)
and (137:39 - 137:42)
uh (137:41 - 137:44)
there are (137:42 - 137:48)
better choices maybe to have been made (137:44 - 137:52)
yeah I think um go ahead the fires are a (137:48 - 137:54)
relatively (137:52 - 137:58)
uh no it's the fires are one thing the (137:54 - 138:00)
other thing is that native Hawaiians (137:58 - 138:03)
have been asking people for years to (138:00 - 138:05)
come to Hawaii less or stop the over (138:03 - 138:07)
tourism (138:05 - 138:10)
um next year 2024 was already expected (138:07 - 138:12)
to be the record-breaking year of (138:10 - 138:13)
Tourism with the largest amount of (138:12 - 138:16)
tourism in that country yet (138:13 - 138:19)
um and this I don't think that when they (138:16 - 138:20)
say that they were just talking to (138:19 - 138:21)
Americans (138:20 - 138:23)
um I get that it's a very popular (138:21 - 138:26)
destination for Japanese tourists as (138:23 - 138:28)
well but yeah (138:26 - 138:31)
this does factor in (138:28 - 138:33)
yeah I don't (138:31 - 138:36)
there there are some Hawaiians that (138:33 - 138:38)
don't mind the tourism and then there (138:36 - 138:41)
are a lot of Hawaiian it depends on who (138:38 - 138:44)
you ask right it is a very complicated (138:41 - 138:47)
thing uh I would I will say this there (138:44 - 138:50)
are more ethical ways to take in (138:47 - 138:54)
Hawaiian tourism if you are interested (138:50 - 138:56)
in being a much better Global Citizen (138:54 - 139:01)
and understanding Hawaii is a very (138:56 - 139:04)
limited resource uh the volcanoes make (139:01 - 139:07)
new islands they don't keep the old ones (139:04 - 139:11)
up so if you want to do this if you have (139:07 - 139:13)
any sense of wanting to do this (139:11 - 139:15)
ethically please research how to (139:13 - 139:19)
ethically visit Hawaii if you are going (139:15 - 139:22)
to go to this world (139:19 - 139:25)
and um yeah yeah (139:22 - 139:29)
there's a lot to be said about going or (139:25 - 139:33)
not going again if you are going to make (139:29 - 139:35)
the choice that feels right for you (139:33 - 139:37)
please attempt to do it in the most (139:35 - 139:40)
ethical way possible and there are a lot (139:37 - 139:43)
of resources online that can help you (139:40 - 139:45)
with that (139:43 - 139:45)
yeah I think uh for me Hawaii was not on (139:45 - 139:53)
my travel destination list at all (139:49 - 139:56)
um personally Hawaii is a very (139:53 - 139:59)
outdoorsy place there's a lot of things (139:56 - 140:01)
to do outside (139:59 - 140:03)
um also like I heard people comparing it (140:01 - 140:05)
to like Japan it's it's not it's it's (140:03 - 140:07)
not like Japan (140:05 - 140:08)
um (140:07 - 140:11)
like I know the US dollar is really (140:08 - 140:14)
strong right now so it's like I got a (140:11 - 140:18)
whole meal in Japan for 1700 Yen for two (140:14 - 140:22)
people that's like 13 USD that same meal (140:18 - 140:24)
two I don't know like a Panera would (140:22 - 140:27)
have been 35 like food in Japan is (140:24 - 140:30)
really cheap transportation in Japan is (140:27 - 140:31)
really cheap getting around is very easy (140:30 - 140:35)
there's also it's a bigger country well (140:31 - 140:37)
Hawaii's another country it's a bigger (140:35 - 140:39)
island there's yes like I want to go to (140:37 - 140:41)
a museum it's a two-hour train right (140:39 - 140:44)
away and that train ride is gonna cost (140:41 - 140:46)
like five dollars because trains are (140:44 - 140:48)
great uh everything in Hawaii is (140:46 - 140:50)
expensive you want a gallon of milk it's (140:48 - 140:52)
like twenty dollars yeah uh it's because (140:50 - 140:56)
they have to ship literally everything (140:52 - 140:57)
to that Island (140:56 - 141:00)
and (140:57 - 141:00)
tourism aside which that's their own (141:01 - 141:05)
issues (141:04 - 141:07)
I just don't know how the Pokemon (141:05 - 141:08)
company (141:07 - 141:11)
puts on (141:08 - 141:14)
Hawaii paid for this right like these (141:11 - 141:15)
States (141:14 - 141:17)
countries they bid for things right (141:15 - 141:19)
that's why you saw so many things in (141:17 - 141:21)
Vegas that's why you saw go Fest in (141:19 - 141:22)
Vegas that's why you're seeing twitchcon (141:21 - 141:23)
in Vegas that's why you're seeing so (141:22 - 141:25)
many because Vegas needs tourists that's (141:23 - 141:27)
how they make all their money they (141:25 - 141:31)
bought they paid a lot of money for a (141:27 - 141:33)
lot of events in 2023 it's very obvious (141:31 - 141:35)
they (141:33 - 141:38)
they want the tourism (141:35 - 141:42)
Hawaii as a state wants the tourism (141:38 - 141:45)
maybe the people don't so (141:42 - 141:46)
who knows when that deal was made it's (141:45 - 141:48)
not like they made it last week usually (141:46 - 141:51)
deals for these huge conventions to (141:48 - 141:54)
bring tourism are made months in advance (141:51 - 141:57)
happens to be a fire happening on top of (141:54 - 141:59)
already the pre-established issues in (141:57 - 142:02)
Hawaii (141:59 - 142:02)
to donate to the fire damage this is the (142:04 - 142:12)
most damaging Wildfire the deadliest (142:09 - 142:14)
wildfire in the U.S in modern history (142:12 - 142:16)
more people have died in this Wildfire (142:14 - 142:17)
than any other U.S wildfire in modern (142:16 - 142:20)
history so there are mutual aid funds (142:17 - 142:22)
there are Community funds that exist (142:20 - 142:24)
maybe do a little research into the (142:22 - 142:27)
funds first what wanted to mention that (142:24 - 142:29)
those exist yeah (142:27 - 142:31)
I just don't know how they (142:29 - 142:33)
they like top (142:31 - 142:39)
London or yeah Yokohama or anything (142:33 - 142:39)
I mean there's there there's a lot (142:40 - 142:47)
there's a lot right like (142:43 - 142:47)
it's not going to be a cold it's not (142:48 - 142:54)
cooling down anytime soon there's a (142:51 - 142:57)
wildfire happening now we hope that it (142:54 - 143:00)
is not a precedent but if we look at (142:57 - 143:02)
California (143:00 - 143:02)
I mean the Wildfire right now is on a (143:03 - 143:07)
different Island Honolulu is on Oahu and (143:05 - 143:11)
the wildfires are on Maui but right (143:07 - 143:14)
uh yeah when I was a kid wildfires (143:11 - 143:16)
didn't happen in Oregon to the extent (143:14 - 143:18)
that they do these days and these days (143:16 - 143:20)
you kind of expect the smoke every year (143:18 - 143:21)
yeah (143:20 - 143:24)
so it's a (143:21 - 143:26)
again (143:24 - 143:28)
I'm not going to judge your choice to go (143:26 - 143:31)
or not to go I would just ask that if (143:28 - 143:35)
you are going to go please research how (143:31 - 143:38)
to do it ethically please try to look at (143:35 - 143:42)
the options to better support native (143:38 - 143:44)
Hawaiians than (143:42 - 143:47)
the very large colleague operations that (143:44 - 143:49)
make a lot of money off of native (143:47 - 143:51)
Hawaiians so there are ways to do it (143:49 - 143:54)
more ethically just research them and (143:51 - 143:56)
proceed like we can't make the company (143:54 - 143:58)
undo the decision like we're not going (143:56 - 144:02)
to convince Pokemon to not do Hawaii the (143:58 - 144:05)
only thing you can do is cause the least (144:02 - 144:10)
amount of damage given the situation and (144:05 - 144:12)
you know (144:10 - 144:16)
decide if going to this is is fits (144:12 - 144:18)
within what you think is ethical and (144:16 - 144:21)
what you want to do (144:18 - 144:21)
I know there are a lot of people that (144:21 - 144:25)
were upset they couldn't go to London (144:23 - 144:27)
because it was expensive because (144:25 - 144:30)
you know travel international travel (144:27 - 144:32)
kind of opened up around there I know a (144:30 - 144:33)
lot of people were upset they could go (144:32 - 144:35)
to Japan because Japan (144:33 - 144:37)
just gin General expensive to travel to (144:35 - 144:41)
sometimes not recently it is (144:37 - 144:44)
Hawaii the most expensive state to (144:41 - 144:46)
travel to in the United States so I'm (144:44 - 144:48)
coming on here and saying (144:46 - 144:50)
I'm maybe this is just the third year (144:48 - 144:51)
you skip (144:50 - 144:55)
like you can travel to way cooler places (144:51 - 144:59)
and probably have a better time and save (144:55 - 145:01)
a lot of money than Hawaii if you're (144:59 - 145:04)
competing obviously that's (145:01 - 145:06)
what Greg said (145:04 - 145:08)
I I get it you're competing you want to (145:06 - 145:11)
win I totally understand (145:08 - 145:11)
I just don't think (145:12 - 145:17)
that this sounds like an amazing event (145:15 - 145:19)
compared to yokama or London and it's (145:17 - 145:23)
also very expensive and there's all the (145:19 - 145:26)
other issues around it so uh maybe it (145:23 - 145:27)
sucks because people are like well come (145:26 - 145:29)
back to the United States technically it (145:27 - 145:32)
is seriously it did (145:29 - 145:36)
maybe skip this one I it's it's yeah it (145:32 - 145:38)
sucks because I want to encourage people (145:36 - 145:40)
to come to worlds (145:38 - 145:42)
and that's what I said in DC (145:40 - 145:44)
and then the pandemic happened and I'm (145:42 - 145:46)
like they've done such a good job of (145:44 - 145:49)
making this a celebration of Pokemon (145:46 - 145:53)
and they even if there wasn't fires even (145:49 - 145:57)
if there wasn't the you know native (145:53 - 146:00)
Hawaiians not loving what is happening (145:57 - 146:02)
to their state (146:00 - 146:05)
Hawaii is just so expensive (146:02 - 146:09)
to to fly to to travel to to get lodging (146:05 - 146:14)
to buy lunch dinner breakfast is just an (146:09 - 146:16)
incredibly expensive State and if you (146:14 - 146:17)
thought Japan was expensive (146:16 - 146:20)
[Laughter] (146:17 - 146:22)
look into high prices (146:20 - 146:26)
yeah it's it's a choice (146:22 - 146:30)
um I I as as much (146:26 - 146:34)
as I want to go to a world I do not (146:30 - 146:37)
think this is the one for me (146:34 - 146:40)
yeah (146:37 - 146:40)
pretty uncomfortable with the decision (146:40 - 146:44)
for a number of reasons on stage they (146:41 - 146:45)
did say they're going to be looking into (146:44 - 146:47)
other ways to support the Wildfire stuff (146:45 - 146:49)
though so they did at least acknowledge (146:47 - 146:51)
it during the announcement yeah as well (146:49 - 146:52)
as the two hundred thousand dollar (146:51 - 146:54)
donation (146:52 - 146:56)
well this hour podcast is going really (146:54 - 146:59)
well uh the last thing I'm gonna say is (146:56 - 147:02)
I hope there's a silver lining here I (146:59 - 147:04)
hope the Silver Lining is um (147:02 - 147:07)
when it comes to gaming I felt like (147:04 - 147:08)
Pokemon was one of the first companies (147:07 - 147:11)
that made a huge donation to the black (147:08 - 147:13)
lives matters movement and then whether (147:11 - 147:15)
or not it was a coincidence but you did (147:13 - 147:17)
see a lot of other companies match that (147:15 - 147:20)
follow Pokemon in that (147:17 - 147:22)
um whether that was Bungie or (147:20 - 147:24)
um Logitech or (147:22 - 147:28)
um epic games right like I'm sure (147:24 - 147:30)
Pokemon wasn't the first big gaming (147:28 - 147:32)
company to do that but it it sounds it (147:30 - 147:33)
seemed like (147:32 - 147:35)
it got a lot of traction when it did and (147:33 - 147:37)
Pokemon it was donated to a lot of other (147:35 - 147:40)
good causes so I I guess the Silver (147:37 - 147:42)
Lining is I hope we see other gaming (147:40 - 147:44)
Industries and other Industries in (147:42 - 147:45)
general (147:44 - 147:49)
donate to Hawaii to help out (147:45 - 147:51)
that cause so (147:49 - 147:54)
the nice thing about Pokemon being one (147:51 - 147:57)
of the biggest brands in the world is (147:54 - 147:59)
companies like to follow what the (147:57 - 148:03)
biggest brands in the world are doing (147:59 - 148:03)
so (148:05 - 148:08)
again I hope that's like some silver (148:06 - 148:10)
lining from this (148:08 - 148:15)
poorly announced announcement (148:10 - 148:17)
the money not the money the money was (148:15 - 148:19)
great money is great any help they can (148:17 - 148:21)
provide is great (148:19 - 148:23)
so (148:21 - 148:25)
um that's our episode (148:23 - 148:27)
uh (148:25 - 148:29)
uh hopefully it is up on time it is 3 (148:27 - 148:32)
A.M here I have to move hotels today (148:29 - 148:34)
that's okay I knew there was gonna be a (148:32 - 148:36)
lot to talk about I went to creatures (148:34 - 148:39)

exciting thing I want to talk to (148:47 - 148:51)
everyone about was the creatures visit I (148:49 - 148:53)
have to reread what I there's like one (148:51 - 148:54)
thing they didn't want like don't talk (148:53 - 148:56)
