exactly yeah oh yeah (2:52 - 2:55)
well we got some pokemon news for you (2:56 - 2:59)
guys today (2:58 - 3:01)
uh (2:59 - 3:03)
nothing in regards (3:01 - 3:04)
to (3:03 - 3:06)
scarlet or violet (3:04 - 3:10)
although there was um (3:06 - 3:13)
for a hot second a a (3:10 - 3:16)
a tweet being like (3:13 - 3:19)
uh pokemon updated their scarlet and (3:16 - 3:22)
violet playlist on youtube (3:19 - 3:23)
possibly (3:22 - 3:25)
scarlet violet news no that didn't (3:23 - 3:27)
happen they also updated like nine other (3:25 - 3:28)
playlists that day i think they were (3:27 - 3:31)
just probably editing the like copy or (3:28 - 3:32)
whatever (3:31 - 3:34)
um so that that was like a thing that (3:32 - 3:38)
happened for a hot minute i guess we're (3:34 - 3:38)
if they'd make any changes to playlist (3:38 - 3:42)
that's breaking news but no nothing (3:40 - 3:43)
happened (3:42 - 3:44)
i think it's a little soon for scarlet (3:43 - 3:46)
and violet stuff (3:44 - 3:49)
anyways but it's like do you do people (3:46 - 3:51)
really have so little to do in their (3:49 - 3:53)
lives that they're like watching what (3:51 - 3:56)
uh what names pokemon company registers (3:53 - 3:59)
with like icon for the internet and like (3:56 - 4:02)
with their youtube playlists yeah maybe (3:59 - 4:04)
i think the answer (4:02 - 4:07)
now 25 years into this is yes i guess so (4:04 - 4:10)
yeah i i would say (4:07 - 4:15)
yes these big youtubers probably have (4:10 - 4:17)
super fans that when they notice (4:15 - 4:19)
something they report to said youtuber (4:17 - 4:20)
and yeah (4:19 - 4:22)
if you don't put out the bait you don't (4:20 - 4:23)
get the click (4:22 - 4:25)
that's true that's true that tweet did (4:23 - 4:26)
get uh (4:25 - 4:27)
like (4:26 - 4:29)
a lot of retweets and a lot of hearts (4:27 - 4:32)
and a lot of quoted tweets and (4:29 - 4:35)
i felt a change in the force yeah i was (4:32 - 4:38)
like this doesn't seem plausible but (4:35 - 4:40)
who am i (4:38 - 4:43)
well obviously they made a a wonderful (4:40 - 4:45)
change to their copy ad and we should (4:43 - 4:46)
look at it and praise them for doing (4:45 - 4:48)
such good work (4:46 - 4:50)
uh it feels like you're a little bitter (4:48 - 4:52)

twitch chat many of people have booked (10:13 - 10:18)
the wrong month of flying okay okay okay (10:15 - 10:20)

with 100 (10:40 - 10:43)
certainty (10:42 - 10:45)
i have (10:43 - 10:46)

money is (10:52 - 10:55)
i'm i'm cheap (10:54 - 10:57)

hundred dollars on something i'm going (10:57 - 11:01)
to make sure (10:58 - 11:03)
even even for pax (11:01 - 11:07)
while i had the dates next to me (11:03 - 11:10)
i went and checked and then checked and (11:07 - 11:12)
then checked and then checked and said (11:10 - 11:15)
yes these dates match (11:12 - 11:18)
i'm good before i even clicked to put in (11:15 - 11:20)
my name (11:18 - 11:22)
because i was not going to even go down (11:20 - 11:24)
the pathway if i didn't know those dates (11:22 - 11:25)
were correct (11:24 - 11:27)
all right continue you bought your (11:25 - 11:31)
i bought my flight to seattle (11:27 - 11:31)
the most cryptic message i had ever ever (11:32 - 11:36)
done was the worst (11:34 - 11:38)
i didn't even i wasn't even gonna (11:36 - 11:40)
complain about that one (11:38 - 11:42)
it's just like flight information (11:40 - 11:44)
purchase flight purchase to seattle in (11:42 - 11:46)
july (11:44 - 11:48)
not even fyi (11:46 - 11:51)
flight information (11:48 - 11:51)
just a (11:52 - 11:56)
little message your flight has been (11:53 - 11:59)
booked just up an image file sent and (11:56 - 12:01)
then a bunch of dates (11:59 - 12:02)
look (12:01 - 12:04)
niantic told us about pokemon go fest (12:02 - 12:06)
like a couple hours before they were (12:04 - 12:08)
announcing it (12:06 - 12:09)
and you (12:08 - 12:11)
managed to ask them during that (12:09 - 12:13)
which park (12:11 - 12:14)
oh they're not gonna tell us (12:13 - 12:16)
also (12:14 - 12:19)
a couple before they announced it (12:16 - 12:21)
what were we gonna do (12:19 - 12:24)
like you could have said hey fyi (12:21 - 12:26)
i'm booking a thing for pokemon go no (12:24 - 12:29)
i'm not gonna break my embargo oh yeah (12:26 - 12:31)
he's got that he's got that magical bond (12:29 - 12:33)
on him that even if he tells us it (12:31 - 12:36)
slices his head off immediately oh (12:33 - 12:38)
oh i this is what because i booked my (12:36 - 12:41)
flight at like 8 00 a.m or something (12:38 - 12:43)
like that and the news was at like 10 (12:41 - 12:45)
and i was going to bed so i booked my (12:43 - 12:47)
flight i sent you guys my flight and (12:45 - 12:48)
then i went to bed because i knew that (12:47 - 12:50)
you would see the announcement you would (12:48 - 12:51)
put two and two greg and will got to (12:50 - 12:54)
spend 12 hours saying what is and i (12:51 - 12:55)
loved greg's (12:54 - 12:57)
description of it this is the worst arj (12:55 - 13:00)
i've ever ever been a part of (12:57 - 13:02)
this is the worst (13:00 - 13:04)
i was like if i divide the dates by the (13:02 - 13:06)
flight numbers do i get a time and is (13:04 - 13:08)
that when we're actually going to go to (13:06 - 13:09)
lunch this week (13:08 - 13:12)
[Laughter] (13:09 - 13:14)
i thought well maybe we'd go we'd see (13:12 - 13:16)
we'd hear more about it at lunch that (13:14 - 13:18)
never happened well here's the thing (13:16 - 13:19)
after last week i didn't think greg (13:18 - 13:23)
would want to go to pokemon go fest (13:19 - 13:23)
i mean after the hotel you decided for (13:23 - 13:28)
me without asking my feelings on it or (13:26 - 13:30)
inform me we had to learn about it in a (13:28 - 13:33)
tweet steve in a tweet that's like (13:30 - 13:35)
breaking up over text (13:33 - 13:39)
oh no it's like breaking up over twitter (13:35 - 13:41)
twitter (13:39 - 13:41)
because i don't know (13:41 - 13:45)
anymore (13:43 - 13:48)
the hotel i got for pax is like a little (13:45 - 13:51)
far away but also like i legit could not (13:48 - 13:53)
afford any of the hotels closer (13:51 - 13:54)
like (13:53 - 13:57)
a little far away you said it's like 17 (13:54 - 14:00)
hours by flight we're somewhere in (13:57 - 14:02)
canada (14:00 - 14:05)
actually booked the hotel in new york (14:02 - 14:07)
i mean if you booked it new york i'd be (14:05 - 14:09)
seeing it i'd be like heck yeah i'm not (14:07 - 14:10)
going i'm not going to pack so i'm going (14:09 - 14:12)
to see some broadway shows (14:10 - 14:14)
this is this is like non-pokemon related (14:12 - 14:18)
flights and hotels have been so weird (14:14 - 14:21)
like i was like i wanted to go to the (14:18 - 14:22)
indianapolis (14:21 - 14:24)
regionals (14:22 - 14:25)

direct was seven hundred dollars yeah (14:33 - 14:39)
because nobody's going there and (14:36 - 14:42)
why wouldn't you drive (14:39 - 14:45)
i don't wanna drive it's like a two-hour (14:42 - 14:46)
flight (14:45 - 14:48)
last time we drove somewhere we broke (14:46 - 14:49)
down on the side of the road oh you're (14:48 - 14:52)
gonna bring that up every time i knew it (14:49 - 14:53)
i knew it i knew you would never let (14:52 - 14:54)
that go (14:53 - 14:56)
i don't want to spend 20 hours in the (14:54 - 14:57)
car (14:56 - 14:59)
i just i don't want to spend 20 hours in (14:57 - 15:02)
a car when like the the the time in (14:59 - 15:03)
between (15:02 - 15:06)
is is being in indiana so that's what i (15:03 - 15:08)
want to get there as quick as possible i (15:06 - 15:09)
want to come back as quick as possible (15:08 - 15:11)
so do an indirect flight (15:09 - 15:13)
no okay so flies issues here's the thing (15:11 - 15:17)
georgia and then up to indiana the e the (15:13 - 15:19)
the european international championships (15:17 - 15:23)
which is in germany is an 800 flight i (15:19 - 15:25)
already looked (15:23 - 15:27)
why would i spend seven hundred dollars (15:25 - 15:28)
to go to indiana (15:27 - 15:31)
i want to go to germany and nobody wants (15:28 - 15:33)
to go to indiana (15:31 - 15:34)
all you need to do is you need to (15:33 - 15:36)
actually put yourself in a box with (15:34 - 15:39)
holes on it and send yourself via (15:36 - 15:42)
dhl and then when i went to book the i'm (15:39 - 15:44)
going to a wedding at the end of seattle (15:42 - 15:47)
i went to go book that hotel (15:44 - 15:49)
it's it was 1 50 at night (15:47 - 15:51)
which is (15:49 - 15:53)
which is end of seattle (15:51 - 15:55)
at the end of sorry oh i'm going to a (15:53 - 15:56)
wedding (15:55 - 15:59)
at the end of april in seattle i went to (15:56 - 16:02)
book that hotel it's 1 50 a night go to (15:59 - 16:05)
book a hotel for pax (16:02 - 16:08)
and like everywhere is like 400 at night (16:05 - 16:10)
which is usually the flip usually (16:08 - 16:12)
seattle hotels are very expensive and (16:10 - 16:13)
boston (16:12 - 16:15)
is not too bad because i've been i've (16:13 - 16:17)
been to pax multiple times and usually (16:15 - 16:20)
the hotel is not that big like when i (16:17 - 16:23)
propose to irene in boston and i i was (16:20 - 16:25)
like let's book a fancy hotel downtown (16:23 - 16:28)
because i'm gonna propose to my wife (16:25 - 16:30)
uh like that hotel was like 170 tonight (16:28 - 16:31)
and that was like (16:30 - 16:33)
one of the nicest hotels down there (16:31 - 16:36)
um well i'll answer your question we're (16:33 - 16:38)
now going to travel back about 40 years (16:36 - 16:40)
in time and talk about the deregulation (16:38 - 16:42)
of the airline industry and how that (16:40 - 16:44)
destroyed air travel in america for the (16:42 - 16:45)
first time (16:44 - 16:47)
[Laughter] (16:45 - 16:49)
thank you reagan (16:47 - 16:51)
yay (16:49 - 16:55)
so i like the concept here of (16:51 - 16:57)
in my head before they announced this we (16:55 - 16:58)
kind of assumed that they were going to (16:57 - 17:00)
do irl locations (16:58 - 17:03)
and i i think that (17:00 - 17:05)
no one on the show or no one who plays (17:03 - 17:07)
pokemon go regularly would think that (17:05 - 17:09)
they would get rid of the global event (17:07 - 17:11)
because of probably one how much money (17:09 - 17:12)
they made and two (17:11 - 17:14)
they kind of figured it out (17:12 - 17:15)
uh (17:14 - 17:16)
it works (17:15 - 17:17)
uh (17:16 - 17:19)
except for new zealand but for everyone (17:17 - 17:21)
i was pretty flaw free (17:19 - 17:23)
thank you new zealand for continuing to (17:21 - 17:24)
test pokemon go for the rest of the (17:23 - 17:26)
world (17:24 - 17:27)
um (17:26 - 17:29)
i kind of expected them to be on the (17:27 - 17:31)
same day so the fact that like the (17:29 - 17:33)
global event is the beginning of june (17:31 - 17:38)
and then the irl events start in july (17:33 - 17:40)
um (17:38 - 17:40)
i think that's fine i think that's i (17:40 - 17:44)
think that's good spacing they probably (17:42 - 17:46)
want to make sure the people who do show (17:44 - 17:47)
up (17:46 - 17:49)
in seattle or germany or japan they (17:47 - 17:51)
don't have those (17:49 - 17:52)
issues because they're also trying to (17:51 - 17:54)
manage a worldwide event at the same (17:52 - 17:56)
time (17:54 - 17:56)
um (17:56 - 17:59)
if you're a hardcore pokemon go super (17:56 - 18:02)
fan which there's plenty out there (17:59 - 18:03)
um (18:02 - 18:04)
seems like you have a very busy summer (18:03 - 18:06)
and it seems like niantic planned your (18:04 - 18:08)
summer for you but like i definitely (18:06 - 18:10)
have met (18:08 - 18:13)
people that try to go to every pogo (18:10 - 18:14)
event out there (18:13 - 18:16)
this is a lot (18:14 - 18:19)
not that like they said three years ago (18:16 - 18:20)
you know they did dortmund chicago (18:19 - 18:22)
yokohama but (18:20 - 18:24)
another three events plus the live event (18:22 - 18:26)
plus whatever else they're planning on (18:24 - 18:27)
doing (18:26 - 18:30)
um (18:27 - 18:31)
and then (18:30 - 18:34)
you know the logo is is shaymin colored (18:31 - 18:37)
which was weird that the year that it (18:34 - 18:39)
should have been shaman they magically (18:37 - 18:41)
switched to (18:39 - 18:43)
was it victini or was it melowetta they (18:41 - 18:46)
like skipped (18:43 - 18:46)
i think it was victini (18:47 - 18:50)
i think so i think you're right and it (18:49 - 18:52)
was like oh why do we why do we skip (18:50 - 18:53)
shaymin (18:52 - 18:56)
my only thought is they skipped shaymin (18:53 - 18:58)
because they knew gen 4 remakes were (18:56 - 18:59)
coming and they wanted to line that up a (18:58 - 19:02)
little bit closer possibly but then it's (18:59 - 19:04)
like well we got shaman in brilliant (19:02 - 19:06)
diamond shining pearl and we got shaymin (19:04 - 19:10)
in legends for owning sword and shield (19:06 - 19:12)
and now we're getting [ __ ] like this a (19:10 - 19:13)
lot you got a lot of opportunities to (19:12 - 19:15)
get shaymin so i'm very excited for the (19:13 - 19:16)
end of the year where somebody goes i (19:15 - 19:18)
still don't have shame pokemon go (19:16 - 19:21)
players don't play the console games so (19:18 - 19:23)
clearly this is their only path to (19:21 - 19:26)
getting a shame in (19:23 - 19:26)
that's not a hundred percent true (19:26 - 19:30)
the heart anything that we say on this (19:28 - 19:33)
program 100 true yes no (19:30 - 19:35)
but i can tell you that i booked the (19:33 - 19:38)
proper weekend to see him until we find (19:35 - 19:40)
out that that's not right (19:38 - 19:43)
there's a kernel of truth a kernel of (19:40 - 19:46)
artistry (19:43 - 19:46)
would you guys are you guys considering (19:46 - 19:50)
going to seattle or berlin or germany or (19:48 - 19:52)
japan yes i'm planning on going to (19:50 - 19:55)
germany exactly without a passport hey (19:52 - 19:58)
the germany is cheaper (19:55 - 20:00)
indiana (19:58 - 20:02)
uh (20:00 - 20:05)
this 100 percent uh a trip to seattle (20:02 - 20:09)
depends on if i'm going to gen gun (20:05 - 20:09)
i think for you greg you would probably (20:13 - 20:16)
have more fun at gen count than pokemon (20:14 - 20:19)
go fest (20:16 - 20:19)
what what basis is that coming from (20:19 - 20:23)
because at gen county you get to meet (20:22 - 20:25)
all your publishers and stuff oh i mean (20:23 - 20:27)
yeah (20:25 - 20:28)
yeah i mean there's like a gen con (20:27 - 20:31)
craig's a celebrity i am yeah we're (20:28 - 20:33)
correct we're just like (20:31 - 20:35)
and (20:33 - 20:38)
we are just those guys with steve (20:35 - 20:40)
who are asked to leave the picture when (20:38 - 20:41)
somebody wants to take a picture with (20:40 - 20:42)
steve (20:41 - 20:44)
and they're like not those two (20:42 - 20:46)
never those two (20:44 - 20:49)
get out (20:46 - 20:51)
uh i mean (20:49 - 20:51)
yeah it really depends on what's (20:51 - 20:54)
happening with gen cotton like i haven't (20:53 - 20:56)
heard back on the press badge if i don't (20:54 - 20:58)
get a press badge i'm not going to gen (20:56 - 21:01)
gun because i'm not paying (20:58 - 21:01)
did she just (21:07 - 21:11)
criticize me earlier (21:09 - 21:14)
yeah but you wanted to go (21:11 - 21:17)
i wanted to go play some pokemon try to (21:14 - 21:19)
win you have a reason to go i if i don't (21:17 - 21:21)
have a reason to go to indiana i'm not (21:19 - 21:23)
going yeah this isn't the year you're (21:21 - 21:25)
published too right right i don't (21:23 - 21:27)
everything i mean i still want to meet (21:25 - 21:28)
my publishers but i do want the (21:27 - 21:30)
listeners to understand where i sit on (21:28 - 21:33)
this totem pole right we go to pokemon (21:30 - 21:35)
events and everybody's like oh steve (21:33 - 21:37)
you're so awesome i want to hang out (21:35 - 21:38)
with you we go to board game events (21:37 - 21:41)
everybody's like oh greg you're so cool (21:38 - 21:43)
and greg's like oh yeah wizards of the (21:41 - 21:45)
coast asked me to moderate this panel (21:43 - 21:46)
about their thing and they gave me five (21:45 - 21:49)
thousand dollars worth of magic supplies (21:46 - 21:51)
and i don't even play magic whatever and (21:49 - 21:52)
like we go anywhere and it's like that (21:51 - 21:54)
actually happened we're like we go (21:52 - 21:57)
anywhere just like who's who's will i (21:54 - 21:59)
look i was so good at magic before i (21:57 - 22:03)
even started playing magic that i got (21:59 - 22:06)
look you benefited from my brilliance at (22:03 - 22:07)
manchester united (22:06 - 22:10)
a little bit you got free stuff from me (22:07 - 22:13)
i i included you and your bad child (22:10 - 22:15)
thank you very much (22:13 - 22:15)
i don't know maybe i mean i like seattle (22:18 - 22:21)
i have a lot of friends in seattle we (22:20 - 22:23)
had that good pizza and sale we had the (22:21 - 22:25)
good pizza in seattle we went there (22:23 - 22:27)
twice they have some good bars in (22:25 - 22:29)
seattle too so (22:27 - 22:30)
um (22:29 - 22:32)
oddly enough we talked about this last (22:30 - 22:35)
week uh of niantic doing more classic (22:32 - 22:36)
community days and (22:35 - 22:39)
here's another one (22:36 - 22:39)
uh so the second class of community uh i (22:39 - 22:43)
i guess (22:42 - 22:44)
myself included thought that nine take (22:43 - 22:46)
was maybe gonna go in order they started (22:44 - 22:49)
with bulbasaur going squirtle was (22:46 - 22:50)
charmander (22:49 - 22:51)
uh (22:50 - 22:53)
seems like they're gonna jump around (22:51 - 22:56)
i heard you like bud kips (22:53 - 22:59)
from sunday april 10th from two to five (22:56 - 23:02)
uh local time i definitely like mudkips (22:59 - 23:04)
the classic community will give you (23:02 - 23:06)
swampert with hydrocannon special (23:04 - 23:09)
research story for a dollar three times (23:06 - 23:11)
the catch bonus uh lure modules will (23:09 - 23:12)
last three hours incense will last three (23:11 - 23:15)
hours (23:12 - 23:15)
man when you look at these bonuses that (23:15 - 23:18)
really makes the stufful community look (23:17 - 23:21)
like a like a can't miss event because (23:18 - 23:24)
that's it those are the voices (23:21 - 23:26)
well this is a classic community it's (23:24 - 23:28)
true that's true (23:26 - 23:30)
the classic the classic bad experience i (23:28 - 23:32)
mean wonderful experience sorry (23:30 - 23:34)
i'm very excited that they decided to do (23:32 - 23:35)
another (23:34 - 23:37)
classic community day for those people (23:35 - 23:40)
to catch up good job niantic (23:37 - 23:43)
uh well it's been (23:40 - 23:45)
gosh what over two almost three years i (23:43 - 23:50)
think for instance mudkip was (23:45 - 23:50)
um i don't know what time is it featured (23:50 - 23:55)
so yeah uh this is i don't even remember (23:56 - 24:01)
where i played mudkip i don't know if (23:59 - 24:03)
that was like (24:01 - 24:04)
mayfair mall i don't know if that was (24:03 - 24:06)
third ward i don't know if that was (24:04 - 24:08)
elmer i have like no clue where i played (24:06 - 24:10)
mudkip (24:08 - 24:13)
um so it's been that long (24:10 - 24:14)
um (24:13 - 24:17)
it's it's a little frustrating that (24:14 - 24:19)
niantic (24:17 - 24:20)
well so we can stop the sentence right (24:19 - 24:22)
there uh it's a it's a little (24:20 - 24:26)
frustrating that niantic was changed the (24:22 - 24:28)
the six hours to three hours (24:26 - 24:30)
you could argue for stuffel they gave (24:28 - 24:31)
you over a month and when i talked to (24:30 - 24:34)
niantic they were like we were we (24:31 - 24:35)
quote (24:34 - 24:37)
we hope that people (24:35 - 24:40)
we hope that giving people a month will (24:37 - 24:42)
like let them plan around it (24:40 - 24:44)
which yeah like a month is a long time (24:42 - 24:46)
you know more time would be better and (24:44 - 24:48)
it's like okay so you gave us a little (24:46 - 24:52)
more than a month to plan for stufful (24:48 - 24:54)
but now you're only going to give us (24:52 - 24:54)
like (24:54 - 24:56)
12 days (24:54 - 24:58)
for (24:56 - 25:01)
according to this research i've done the (24:58 - 25:05)
first mudkip day was july 2019. (25:01 - 25:06)
so three years (25:05 - 25:08)
yeah almost three years almost three (25:06 - 25:09)
years (25:08 - 25:12)
uh i would have done it at the art park (25:09 - 25:13)
um (25:12 - 25:15)
true (25:13 - 25:17)
were you here in 2019 will you moved in (25:15 - 25:20)
twenty was but it was july fourth (25:17 - 25:23)
weekend so right (25:20 - 25:23)
yeah yeah (25:24 - 25:29)
so yeah uh (25:26 - 25:31)
i (25:29 - 25:31)
i i i don't know why this was like a (25:35 - 25:39)
last minute like i don't know why they (25:37 - 25:41)
need (25:39 - 25:42)
why would we only get like two weeks for (25:41 - 25:44)
this this i'm sure they have their (25:42 - 25:46)
reasons (25:44 - 25:47)
janine (25:46 - 25:50)
and geneva's like slap it here i got (25:47 - 25:52)
nothing no the only thing i could maybe (25:50 - 25:55)
guess is that they (25:52 - 25:57)
wanted a certain pokemon and they were (25:55 - 26:00)
probably getting pushback from tpci and (25:57 - 26:02)
then tpci finally settled and wanted (26:00 - 26:04)
mudkip and then (26:02 - 26:06)
that was it (26:04 - 26:09)
they wanted a certain pokemon uh (26:06 - 26:10)
i feel like we talked about this before (26:09 - 26:11)
but like (26:10 - 26:14)
the pokemon company is (26:11 - 26:16)
what approves community day like niantic (26:14 - 26:18)
just can't pick a pokemon (26:16 - 26:20)
like they have what do you think they (26:18 - 26:22)
wanted (26:20 - 26:24)
i don't know (26:22 - 26:26)
charizard (26:24 - 26:28)
no i'm pretty sure the pokemon company (26:26 - 26:30)
definitely wants charizard all the time (26:28 - 26:33)
if possible (26:30 - 26:33)
uh (26:33 - 26:36)
i mean if they were going to go in order (26:34 - 26:37)
then it would have been what it would (26:36 - 26:39)
have been squirtle yeah (26:37 - 26:40)
i mean because they would have skipped (26:39 - 26:42)
charizard because you saved that for a (26:40 - 26:43)
special event when you really need to (26:42 - 26:46)
get people to come out (26:43 - 26:46)
so but (26:46 - 26:49)
they did already have two charmander (26:47 - 26:50)
communities so that would have been a (26:49 - 26:53)
third without anyone else being doubled (26:50 - 26:55)
i think charmander's the only one that's (26:53 - 26:56)
been (26:55 - 26:58)
doubled (26:56 - 27:01)
because it won that vote (26:58 - 27:01)
because it was like a vote for four and (27:02 - 27:06)
one was like caterpie (27:04 - 27:08)
charmander and squirtle or whatever and (27:06 - 27:10)
it was like no contest no evie has been (27:08 - 27:12)
doubled evie as well so charmander and (27:10 - 27:14)
evie are the two that have been doubled (27:12 - 27:16)
so now mudkip is the next one doubled (27:14 - 27:19)
what was the original classic (27:16 - 27:19)
yeah i was talking before they started (27:22 - 27:28)
doing classic communities (27:25 - 27:28)
because charmander was just that (27:28 - 27:31)
whatever that month was it wasn't like a (27:30 - 27:33)
classic it was like our month is now (27:31 - 27:36)
dedicated to charmander again (27:33 - 27:39)
the best pokemon (27:36 - 27:40)
they should just make it char like just (27:39 - 27:42)
skip the charmander part just throw the (27:40 - 27:44)
charizards out there and you know people (27:42 - 27:46)
let people go crazy (27:44 - 27:49)
uh (27:46 - 27:49)
what (27:50 - 27:53)
it's a community day i don't know like (27:51 - 27:55)
like the you look i look at the event (27:53 - 27:58)
bonuses and it's like (27:55 - 28:00)
no bonus lucky trade like stufful no (27:58 - 28:02)
half trades like like i get it it's (28:00 - 28:03)
classic it's supposed to be the same (28:02 - 28:05)
things it was before it's three hours (28:03 - 28:08)
it's well not even that but it's more (28:05 - 28:10)
like (28:08 - 28:12)
it's less pressure (28:10 - 28:13)
you don't you don't like the fact that (28:12 - 28:17)
there's no bonuses you're not (28:13 - 28:17)
you've already got your mudkips (28:18 - 28:22)
is the hydrocannon different than the (28:21 - 28:26)
last time no no but like because like at (28:22 - 28:27)
the time (28:26 - 28:29)
i would say (28:27 - 28:31)
i wasn't into gbl (28:29 - 28:32)
saying i'm into gbl now is kind of a (28:31 - 28:34)
stretch but i do like (28:32 - 28:36)
big stretch i i do like the like jungle (28:34 - 28:39)
cup and the the like love cup like the (28:36 - 28:40)
little things they do i think those cups (28:39 - 28:41)
are really great and they're they're (28:40 - 28:44)
easier easier to plan for but (28:41 - 28:46)
like when (28:44 - 28:48)
like at the time three years ago i (28:46 - 28:50)
didn't know that hydro cannon swampert (28:48 - 28:52)
would be like what top (28:50 - 28:54)
top five pokemon in in certain gbl (28:52 - 28:57)
formats like like hydrocannon swampert's (28:54 - 28:59)
incredibly good so (28:57 - 29:01)
in the in the case of like well i don't (28:59 - 29:03)
need any more shinies (29:01 - 29:05)
because what am i going to do with 50 (29:03 - 29:06)
shiny mudkip (29:05 - 29:09)
um (29:06 - 29:10)
it would be nice to go out to try to get (29:09 - 29:13)
a good mudkip for gbl so there's there's (29:10 - 29:15)
that which i wouldn't really have (29:13 - 29:16)
considered three years ago for myself (29:15 - 29:18)
and maybe for some other people (29:16 - 29:20)
well i mean okay so those people are (29:18 - 29:22)
motivated but they're not motivated by (29:20 - 29:23)
trades (29:22 - 29:25)
and stardust and that business you gotta (29:23 - 29:29)
get the lucky mudkip easier to power up (29:25 - 29:29)
um april fool's two oh (29:31 - 29:36)
okay we got it (29:37 - 29:41)

10 a.m local time to 10 (30:49 - 30:54)
and then ditto will appear more in the (30:52 - 30:55)
wild (30:54 - 30:57)
you could get a shiny ditto (30:55 - 30:59)
and then (30:57 - 31:01)
so that that that is the that is the (30:59 - 31:03)
event but then more specifically (31:01 - 31:06)

anything because like i mean i'm sure (31:45 - 31:49)
they had their reasons it's it's april (31:47 - 31:51)
fool's it was the yeah fool's prank you (31:49 - 31:54)
can't give people warning about the (31:51 - 31:55)
warning i mean (31:54 - 31:57)
and i'll be honest because i (31:55 - 32:01)
i started in the morning and literally (31:57 - 32:03)
played for like three hours in the (32:01 - 32:05)
morning from when i first signed into (32:03 - 32:08)
pokemon go about 7am (32:05 - 32:11)
and did not see any dittos at all and i (32:08 - 32:14)
was like that's what the april fools is (32:11 - 32:15)
it's like they're telling you to catch (32:14 - 32:17)
dittos but there actually aren't any (32:15 - 32:18)
dittos yeah (32:17 - 32:20)
uh (32:18 - 32:24)
i again i the the three hour dinner time (32:20 - 32:26)
hit when i went to the gym (32:24 - 32:29)
but uh due to the lack of (32:26 - 32:32)
actual service out where my gym is i did (32:29 - 32:34)
my one round i was like well (32:32 - 32:37)
that's all i can do i got two dittos (32:34 - 32:39)
and i'm out i did hear one person say (32:37 - 32:42)
that they got a shiny ghastly caught it (32:39 - 32:45)
and it changed into a normal ditto (32:42 - 32:47)
yeah (32:45 - 32:47)
i did i did not get it i think that that (32:47 - 32:52)
ditto that gastly came from like field (32:50 - 32:53)
research (32:52 - 32:56)
oh yeah and that's why it happened (32:53 - 33:00)
so somebody programmed the wild (32:56 - 33:01)
encounters but not the (33:00 - 33:04)
field the research encounters (33:01 - 33:06)
yeah i caught about 15 ditto but none of (33:04 - 33:07)
them were shiny (33:06 - 33:09)
yeah i don't know what the odds were i (33:07 - 33:11)
i'd probably guess it was probably one (33:09 - 33:14)
in 20 or something it seemed high but (33:11 - 33:16)
not like (33:14 - 33:18)
maybe one in 25. (33:16 - 33:19)
um i (33:18 - 33:21)

who is skid is it a rocket radar 100 or (35:20 - 35:25)
maybe a rocket radar is 200 i think it's (35:23 - 35:27)
a (35:25 - 35:30)
it's a rocket radar two dollars there's (35:27 - 35:32)
no way (35:30 - 35:32)
who is buying this box there's no way a (35:33 - 35:38)
rocket radars i have to check (35:36 - 35:40)
it's 200 (35:38 - 35:42)
200 coins two dollars for (35:40 - 35:45)
so even five five times 200 is is a (35:42 - 35:48)
thousand so you're paying an extra two (35:45 - 35:49)
dollars and seventy five cents for two (35:48 - 35:52)
ten max potions and ten revives (35:49 - 35:54)
what (35:52 - 35:54)
i have 19 rocket radars can i sell these (35:55 - 36:02)
to somebody because i don't use that (35:58 - 36:02)
i am mostly over the whole (36:03 - 36:10)
team go rocket stuff yeah it's it's (36:07 - 36:13)
exhausting i would i would perhaps put (36:10 - 36:15)
out money to never see them for like a (36:13 - 36:16)
year (36:15 - 36:18)
no okay i don't think team rocket is (36:16 - 36:21)
that exhausting in general like when's (36:18 - 36:23)
the last time we had a team rocket event (36:21 - 36:26)
fall or something no the last time we (36:23 - 36:28)
had a team rocket event was all of these (36:26 - 36:30)
research things that i have to do where (36:28 - 36:31)
i had to battle rocket people that i (36:30 - 36:33)
don't want to do so they sit in my (36:31 - 36:35)
research for all the targets wanting me (36:33 - 36:37)
and telling me what a failure i am i (36:35 - 36:39)
also have a question before we get too (36:37 - 36:42)
far down isn't it numble (36:39 - 36:46)
yes is it yes is it they're numb (36:42 - 36:47)
i'm numb (36:46 - 36:48)
i mean you are (36:47 - 36:49)
they're yeah they're not new they're (36:48 - 36:51)
numb they're number (36:49 - 36:54)
numbo (36:51 - 36:54)
i (36:56 - 37:00)
when when like a field research or (36:58 - 37:03)
whatever or like a quest is is like (37:00 - 37:06)
battle six go trainers that's fine (37:03 - 37:09)
the thing that destroyed me completely (37:06 - 37:12)
on team rocket was (37:09 - 37:15)
level 45 in pokemon go (37:12 - 37:17)
if you're not in there yet if you're not (37:15 - 37:19)
there yet let me (37:17 - 37:21)
delight you here (37:19 - 37:23)
you need to defeat (37:21 - 37:27)
a hundred team rocket go grunts (37:23 - 37:29)
you need to purify a hundred shadow (37:27 - 37:31)
pokemon (37:29 - 37:34)
now you thought the 100 grunts oh boy (37:31 - 37:37)
guess what you have to defeat (37:34 - 37:41)
50 team rocket go leaders (37:37 - 37:42)
50. (37:41 - 37:46)
in order to build a rocket radar (37:42 - 37:47)
you need to do (37:46 - 37:48)
is it (37:47 - 37:51)
six right yeah six (37:48 - 37:53)
so six grunts so (37:51 - 37:58)
if you do 60 of the 100 (37:53 - 38:00)
rocket grunts that is only defeating a (37:58 - 38:02)
leader (38:00 - 38:06)
six times out of fifty (38:02 - 38:06)
no wait no oh sorry ten times yeah ten (38:07 - 38:13)
times i'm like math (38:11 - 38:15)
so you have to (38:13 - 38:18)
theoretically (38:15 - 38:18)
defeat (38:18 - 38:23)
two hundred and (38:20 - 38:25)
three hundred and three hundred rocket (38:23 - 38:27)
grunts yeah (38:25 - 38:29)
it's fun (38:27 - 38:31)
three hundred well so you're telling me (38:29 - 38:32)
i'm right to have (38:31 - 38:34)
saved all of these rocket radios and not (38:32 - 38:38)
use them yes you've please save them (38:34 - 38:40)
until level 45. i mean or (38:38 - 38:43)
you because everyone you've saved is six (38:40 - 38:45)
less rocket battles or you can spend a (38:43 - 38:47)
hundred dollars and just buy (38:45 - 38:50)
50 rocket radars i'm sure i'm sure those (38:47 - 38:52)
people exist just do it i mean why not (38:50 - 38:54)
give such a wonderful company all your (38:52 - 38:58)
money if you if you had (38:54 - 38:58)
if you had um if you if you didn't have (39:00 - 39:06)
a money like if you were just rich (39:02 - 39:06)
i wouldn't be doing this (39:06 - 39:10)
[Laughter] (39:07 - 39:12)
why would you waste your time battling (39:10 - 39:14)
six rocket grunts and why would you just (39:12 - 39:16)
not pay the two dollars that's nothing (39:14 - 39:18)
it's nothing yeah it needs nothing the (39:16 - 39:21)
time investment of six rocket grunts (39:18 - 39:24)
is a lot although i would say if i was (39:21 - 39:27)
rich the time investment of that money (39:24 - 39:29)
sitting in interest (39:27 - 39:31)
would be more than me (39:29 - 39:33)
spending my time (39:31 - 39:35)
battling wreckage on my own time because (39:33 - 39:36)
that (39:35 - 39:37)
if i take that money out it's not making (39:36 - 39:39)
me money anymore (39:37 - 39:41)
money begets money if i spend it on (39:39 - 39:43)
frivolous things those rocket radars are (39:41 - 39:46)
one and done gone i believe it's warren (39:43 - 39:48)
buffett who said uh (39:46 - 39:50)
if your money's not working for you when (39:48 - 39:52)
you're asleep you've done something (39:50 - 39:55)
wrong i don't know the full quote (39:52 - 39:56)
if your mind is not working for you (39:55 - 39:59)
while you're battling team go rocket (39:56 - 40:02)
what are you doing with your life mm-hmm (39:59 - 40:04)
i mean i think team go rocket is trying (40:02 - 40:06)
to get you to spend their your money (40:04 - 40:09)
because that is the real evil corporate (40:06 - 40:10)
they were the mob they were the mob (40:09 - 40:12)
until gen 2 and then they became a weird (40:10 - 40:15)
cult but (40:12 - 40:15)
uh i (40:17 - 40:21)
anticipate the day in two years where (40:18 - 40:23)
salandit is much easier to get and i (40:21 - 40:26)
don't have to worry about 12k eggs (40:23 - 40:28)
is very exciting (40:26 - 40:30)
i will patiently wait for um (40:28 - 40:32)
[Music] (40:30 - 40:36)
like i i i i love your optimism that (40:32 - 40:38)
will be around in two years like the (40:36 - 40:40)
world as a whole but hey genetics (40:38 - 40:44)
they're with you don't buy in (40:40 - 40:44)
well (40:44 - 40:47)
i think about it in the sense of like is (40:44 - 40:48)
there any reward for completing your (40:47 - 40:51)
pokedex no and that's cool there doesn't (40:48 - 40:53)
have to be a little metal (40:51 - 40:55)
yeah but that metal doesn't do anything (40:53 - 40:57)
you know why (40:55 - 40:59)
for all the ridiculous things that you (40:57 - 41:01)
point out that people care about they (40:59 - 41:04)
literally put on one of these pokemon go (41:01 - 41:06)
community days there will not be a medal (41:04 - 41:08)
for this community day oh yeah yeah (41:06 - 41:11)
because people actually care (41:08 - 41:13)
i mean i care about the titles (41:11 - 41:15)
but not in the sense of like look look i (41:13 - 41:17)
like salan i think it's a great pokemon (41:15 - 41:21)
a huge star in new pokemon snap just a (41:17 - 41:23)
wonderful pokemon in general love the (41:21 - 41:26)
love the concept of how male stalandic (41:23 - 41:28)
can evolve love everything about zlandit (41:26 - 41:31)
there is nothing pokemon snap (41:28 - 41:33)
it's in the the final area before you (41:31 - 41:34)
draw it's where (41:33 - 41:36)
it's like right before gerard it's right (41:34 - 41:39)
after jirachi pops up (41:36 - 41:40)
you start the course (41:39 - 41:42)
is there right away you take pictures of (41:40 - 41:43)
rashi you turn into the cave male cell (41:42 - 41:46)
and male 7 oh yeah (41:43 - 41:49)
that's how big of a silent fan i am i (41:46 - 41:50)
know exactly where they are in new (41:49 - 41:53)
pokemon snap are you a big fan i love (41:50 - 41:55)
salandit i've never seen you wear (41:53 - 41:57)
salanded merch i've never seen one on (41:55 - 41:58)
your team (41:57 - 42:00)
i've never seen you even made it you (41:58 - 42:02)
even made it the year of the male (42:00 - 42:04)
salandit when that is given to the (42:02 - 42:08)
pokemon you like the least true (42:04 - 42:09)
male salandit (42:08 - 42:11)
is a wonderful pokemon greg (42:09 - 42:13)
yeah but not according to you because (42:11 - 42:16)
you treat it like dirt (42:13 - 42:18)
where is your mail salandit merch where (42:16 - 42:20)
is your mail slanted skateboard where's (42:18 - 42:21)
your (42:20 - 42:24)
artwork if they had a slanted skateboard (42:21 - 42:26)
i'm saying it right now i will purchase (42:24 - 42:27)
it (42:26 - 42:30)
where's your male celante tattoo (42:27 - 42:31)
but it has to be a boys to land it all (42:30 - 42:33)
right here's here's the real question (42:31 - 42:36)
kramer ant male salandit oh cramer ant (42:33 - 42:40)
um not a true fan then true okay so (42:36 - 42:43)
this is this is how i think right (42:40 - 42:46)
oof (42:43 - 42:46)
here we go (42:47 - 42:52)
salandit is in 12k eggs (42:49 - 42:55)
you have to either spend two dollars or (42:52 - 42:59)
sp battle six rocket grunts for a chance (42:55 - 43:01)
to get a 12k egg you don't have to walk (42:59 - 43:03)
that 12k egg and (43:01 - 43:06)
in reality you're probably going to get (43:03 - 43:10)
absol or vullaby or whatever other bad (43:06 - 43:11)
pokemon is in there you're not going to (43:10 - 43:13)
get slandered because it's probably the (43:11 - 43:16)
rarest pokemon in that egg (43:13 - 43:18)
and then you hatch it and then you go i (43:16 - 43:20)
hatched it oh it's a male i can't evolve (43:18 - 43:21)
it (43:20 - 43:22)
and then what (43:21 - 43:26)
and then do it all again for a pot like (43:22 - 43:28)
why i just (43:26 - 43:32)
the energy you would have to put in (43:28 - 43:35)
to this to get us for what to be like i (43:32 - 43:39)
have it the work is its own reward steve (43:35 - 43:42)
that's true i i i believe that niantic (43:39 - 43:45)
has a plan here and that is to make you (43:42 - 43:49)
spend money on incubators and (43:45 - 43:51)
and team rocket and i understand the (43:49 - 43:54)
corporate plan and i don't think the (43:51 - 43:55)
fact that we are supporting such a (43:54 - 43:58)
wonderful corporation as niantic that (43:55 - 44:00)
alone is a reward me getting a male (43:58 - 44:03)
slandered is also a reward that i am (44:00 - 44:05)
thrilled to have the chance to do (44:03 - 44:08)
as as somebody who needs to make content (44:05 - 44:11)
frequently to then get money to pay my (44:08 - 44:12)
bills (44:11 - 44:14)
i can applaud the like (44:12 - 44:17)
niantic being like we're gonna sucker at (44:14 - 44:19)
least one percent of our player base (44:17 - 44:21)
into going for this and that's going to (44:19 - 44:24)
pay the bills look (44:21 - 44:27)
we're all we're all slaves to corporate (44:24 - 44:29)
america here i understand (44:27 - 44:31)
they have come up with a system to make (44:29 - 44:34)
money off people and i applaud that i am (44:31 - 44:36)
more so applauding the people that are (44:34 - 44:39)
like me and that are like ah niantic i (44:36 - 44:42)
will wait a full year until it's easier (44:39 - 44:44)
to get this pokemon (44:42 - 44:47)
what can we do what what so we need to (44:44 - 44:51)
record a series of random podcasts (44:47 - 44:53)
and one of them will be good and then (44:51 - 44:56)
people will get a random code for a (44:53 - 44:57)
dollar (44:56 - 44:59)
and then just keep paying us until they (44:57 - 45:02)
get the good episode (44:59 - 45:02)
this is how we monetize this show (45:02 - 45:06)
got it i thought we just monetized the (45:05 - 45:09)
show through patreon yeah no this is an (45:06 - 45:11)
edition this is tap it into that (45:09 - 45:13)
gamification (45:11 - 45:16)
gambling mentality maybe this time it'll (45:13 - 45:17)
be good (45:16 - 45:19)
again i have i have no problem with them (45:17 - 45:19)
like (45:19 - 45:22)
uh hiding a pokemon behind these like (45:19 - 45:24)
hoops you have to jump (45:22 - 45:26)
because i know that eventually it'll be (45:24 - 45:27)
easier to get i'm just to the point in (45:26 - 45:29)
the game where it's like (45:27 - 45:32)
i'll just wait for it to be easier (45:29 - 45:34)
like i just (45:32 - 45:37)
yeah because eventually right in what (45:34 - 45:40)
five years we're gonna have (45:37 - 45:42)
pokemon alola tour (45:40 - 45:45)
and oh yeah they'll have it in there (45:42 - 45:47)
yeah it's like the whole when when we (45:45 - 45:50)
did go fest together (45:47 - 45:52)
this whole podcast has come full circle (45:50 - 45:54)
we start with go fest we'll end with go (45:52 - 45:56)
fest before the break um when we did go (45:54 - 45:58)
fest together at the art park (45:56 - 46:01)
they had dino in raids yeah and i was (45:58 - 46:03)
like i'm not falling for this again i (46:01 - 46:05)
fell for i fell for it the first time (46:03 - 46:07)
with gibbel in raids for the go fest (46:05 - 46:09)
prior to that and i knew what was (46:07 - 46:11)
happening i knew i was falling for it (46:09 - 46:13)
but i was like i had two people next to (46:11 - 46:15)
you saying stop falling for it and (46:13 - 46:18)
you're like nah i need it (46:15 - 46:18)
and they put dino in rates for go fest (46:18 - 46:23)
because they're easy dollars they could (46:21 - 46:25)
get out of people but we all know there (46:23 - 46:28)
will be a dino community day (46:25 - 46:30)
and it's like do i (46:28 - 46:33)
because of the excitement of this event (46:30 - 46:35)
do you spend dollar after dollar after (46:33 - 46:37)
dollar to get dino or do i just wait (46:35 - 46:38)
probably what a year i would actually (46:37 - 46:40)
expect dino community day is probably (46:38 - 46:43)
going to be this year probably near the (46:40 - 46:45)
end of the year i would assume if not (46:43 - 46:46)
over the summer probably october because (46:45 - 46:49)
it's a good ghost pokemon yeah dino is (46:46 - 46:52)
my favorite ghost pokemon (46:49 - 46:52)
and then (46:53 - 46:57)
and then the only then everyone wins (46:54 - 46:59)
except for the people who spent (46:57 - 47:01)
a bunch of money on dino during go go uh (46:59 - 47:02)
go fest and they're going to be like oh (47:01 - 47:04)
my god it's not special anymore they (47:02 - 47:06)
went world first mm-hmm (47:04 - 47:08)
yeah you know i think they haven't hydra (47:06 - 47:10)
gun before everyone else that's cool and (47:08 - 47:12)
i can go around and go (47:10 - 47:13)
and then when everybody else has theirs (47:12 - 47:15)
i can go around and cry saying mine's (47:13 - 47:18)
been devalued by all you by all you late (47:15 - 47:20)
comers and johnny come lately greg that (47:18 - 47:23)
attitude is seeping back in sorry sorry (47:20 - 47:26)
they are the money well spent they are (47:23 - 47:27)
happy with the year that they get to (47:26 - 47:29)
spend with their shiny friends (47:27 - 47:32)
and then everybody else gets to catch up (47:29 - 47:34)
and have a wonderful experience with (47:32 - 47:37)
their shiny three-headed i will (47:34 - 47:41)
admit if if dino or gibble or salan if (47:37 - 47:43)
the if these were my favorite pokemon i (47:41 - 47:46)
would probably give niantic the money (47:43 - 47:48)
and do it and probably not be super (47:46 - 47:50)
salty at the end (47:48 - 47:51)
i mean when (47:50 - 47:55)
they first released shiny rosalia i did (47:51 - 47:57)
no extra hunting because i'm like i'll (47:55 - 47:58)
catch it at some point she's my favorite (47:57 - 48:01)
pokemon but i might give them money (47:58 - 48:04)
uh but if once cramer ant comes (48:01 - 48:07)
all all hands on deck although you spent (48:04 - 48:10)
like 80 and unite a game you don't like (48:07 - 48:11)
playing (48:10 - 48:14)
what no uh (48:11 - 48:16)
full disclosure the the gems i spent in (48:14 - 48:17)
unite were provided to me by the pokemon (48:16 - 48:20)
company i have only given unite 20 of my (48:17 - 48:22)
own dollars i did spend 150 in apex (48:20 - 48:23)
legends but we're not going to talk (48:22 - 48:24)
about that right now we're going to (48:23 - 48:27)
quick break uh when we come back we'll (48:24 - 48:28)
talk about (48:27 - 48:31)
bread (48:28 - 48:31)
be right back (48:31 - 48:34)
and we are back from our break hey i (48:36 - 48:43)
wanted to circle back bread (48:40 - 48:45)
no bread is at the end i wanted to (48:43 - 48:47)
circle back to the conversation we had (48:45 - 48:49)
last week (48:47 - 48:51)
about pogo (48:49 - 48:53)
yeah i remember having a conversation (48:51 - 48:55)
about pogo last week i certainly didn't (48:53 - 48:59)
have a conversation about pogo last week (48:55 - 48:59)
we had a we had a two-hour show (49:01 - 49:06)
uh that was kind of centered around (49:03 - 49:09)
some choices that niantic made (49:06 - 49:11)
and there was a lot of good discussion (49:09 - 49:13)
both in our discord and our slack and (49:11 - 49:14)
our twitch channel (49:13 - 49:18)
um and the youtube comments and on (49:14 - 49:21)
twitter and everything so um (49:18 - 49:22)
there's a lot of good discussion around (49:21 - 49:24)
that stuff (49:22 - 49:26)
um (49:24 - 49:26)
but there was a there was a couple (49:27 - 49:29)
things that were on my mind that we (49:28 - 49:31)
didn't really get to and i feel like if (49:29 - 49:33)
we just don't cover it now after that (49:31 - 49:35)
episode then we're going to get like (49:33 - 49:36)
sword and shiv we're going to get like (49:35 - 49:38)
scarlet violet news and then all this (49:36 - 49:39)
other stuff and then we're going to get (49:38 - 49:40)
away from it (49:39 - 49:42)
um (49:40 - 49:44)
and i think i think in general that's (49:42 - 49:45)
the (49:44 - 49:46)
the fact that the stufful community (49:45 - 49:48)
hasn't happened yet (49:46 - 49:50)
makes this kind of still on people's (49:48 - 49:51)
radar (49:50 - 49:53)
uh so (49:51 - 49:56)
a couple things and i'll just go off (49:53 - 49:59)
maybe easiest and hardest was i was (49:56 - 50:02)
thinking about the community aspect of (49:59 - 50:04)
niantic saying they want to force people (50:02 - 50:06)
to play together (50:04 - 50:09)
because that is community (50:06 - 50:11)
and i was thinking about this in the (50:09 - 50:13)
sense of watching wrestling with will (50:11 - 50:15)
yesterday (50:13 - 50:18)
and i i did extend the offer to greg of (50:15 - 50:19)
like hey greg you want to come over and (50:18 - 50:21)
watch wrestling knowing that like greg (50:19 - 50:23)
had you know zero interest in watching (50:21 - 50:26)
wrestling well i appreciate the invite (50:23 - 50:27)
the first invite of the week (50:26 - 50:29)
[Laughter] (50:27 - 50:31)
true (50:29 - 50:34)
but i was i was (50:31 - 50:36)
when i was watching wrestling last night (50:34 - 50:37)
and being very disappointed with the ten (50:36 - 50:39)
dollars i spent on watching wrestling (50:37 - 50:42)
i was like (50:39 - 50:42)
this would be a good show (50:43 - 50:46)
for (50:46 - 50:49)
greg to watch like if if we're looking (50:46 - 50:52)
at any wrestling product in general it (50:49 - 50:53)
wouldn't be like monday night raw it (50:52 - 50:55)
wouldn't be like friday night smackdown (50:53 - 50:57)
it wouldn't be like one of their other (50:55 - 51:00)
pay-per-views like wrestlemania (50:57 - 51:02)
and i would probably argue (51:00 - 51:04)
money in the bank summerslam summerslam (51:02 - 51:06)
and then probably the royal rumble or (51:04 - 51:08)
like the four pay-per-views that are (51:06 - 51:10)
like if this is somebody's first time (51:08 - 51:13)
getting into wrestling this is what you (51:10 - 51:15)
want to show them but because it's not (51:13 - 51:17)
my first time getting into wrestling (51:15 - 51:20)
well you know for a person in general (51:17 - 51:22)
like hey i want to guess so that that's (51:20 - 51:24)
how i got irene into wrestling was the (51:22 - 51:26)
royal rumble i was like this like if you (51:24 - 51:27)
don't like the royal rumble you're not (51:26 - 51:28)
going to like (51:27 - 51:30)
raw you're not going to like smack (51:28 - 51:31)
you're not going to like anything else (51:30 - 51:32)
because like this is the best they have (51:31 - 51:33)
to offer (51:32 - 51:35)
and i really think (51:33 - 51:37)
that community day is that for pogo like (51:35 - 51:39)
community is kind of the best that (51:37 - 51:41)
niantic has to offer (51:39 - 51:43)
and one of the things that we talked (51:41 - 51:44)
about (51:43 - 51:45)
well (51:44 - 51:47)
i i do i do think like communion days (51:45 - 51:50)
are like the better like the better pogo (51:47 - 51:53)
experiences and we talked about how (51:50 - 51:54)
last week (51:53 - 51:56)
that (51:54 - 51:56)
none of us really talked to anyone in (51:56 - 52:01)
community like we go out there and like (51:58 - 52:03)
we just do our own thing i would argue (52:01 - 52:05)
the best they have to offer are safari (52:03 - 52:07)
zones and go fest (52:05 - 52:08)
that is the best they have to offer (52:07 - 52:10)
because they really do those very well (52:08 - 52:12)
yes i do agree with you but those are (52:10 - 52:15)
paid experiences (52:12 - 52:17)
yeah but you had like if you're gonna (52:15 - 52:20)
make the wrestling analogies so is the (52:17 - 52:21)
things that you're saying are good okay (52:20 - 52:23)
okay don't don't push on it too hard (52:21 - 52:25)
it'll break because literally you're (52:23 - 52:27)
saying you paid ten dollars but that'd (52:25 - 52:29)
be an ideal experience for me to get in (52:27 - 52:31)
so you paid for the better experience (52:29 - 52:34)
one for one go fest and those are a paid (52:31 - 52:35)
experience and they're a better (52:34 - 52:37)
experience and that is a good way to get (52:35 - 52:38)
piece of people in greg (52:37 - 52:39)
because you're going to say that the (52:38 - 52:41)
best experience comes when you give them (52:39 - 52:42)
money (52:41 - 52:44)
leave that last week that we're in this (52:42 - 52:45)
week (52:44 - 52:47)
you wouldn't have had to pay the ten (52:45 - 52:49)
dollars i paid i did exactly well and (52:47 - 52:52)
it's okay and it's like this and you (52:49 - 52:54)
don't have to pay for the research (52:52 - 52:56)
for community day to still enjoy the (52:54 - 52:59)
community day (52:56 - 52:59)
yes all right did you have something (53:00 - 53:02)
else to say steve because i had one (53:01 - 53:04)
other thing to say about people's (53:02 - 53:06)
interpretation of community day (53:04 - 53:08)
but okay so even if we don't talk to (53:06 - 53:11)
anyone there's still that energy there (53:08 - 53:13)
which i think is the important part (53:11 - 53:17)
like you could go to wrestlemania or you (53:13 - 53:19)
could go to a sports game or you could (53:17 - 53:21)
go to a concert and not talk to anyone (53:19 - 53:24)
there but the energy of people around (53:21 - 53:27)
you is infectious and it is why you (53:24 - 53:30)
would go to wrestlemania or it's why you (53:27 - 53:33)
would go to raw or smackdown and not (53:30 - 53:34)
talk to anyone and walk away feeling (53:33 - 53:36)
like that was a good experience because (53:34 - 53:39)
you're surrounded by those people and (53:36 - 53:41)
the energy even like even when i've i've (53:39 - 53:43)
went to smackdown twice (53:41 - 53:45)
never talked to a single person around (53:43 - 53:47)
me but i walked away being like it was (53:45 - 53:50)
cool to be around those people (53:47 - 53:52)
that is a double-edged sword (53:50 - 53:54)
sure (53:52 - 53:57)
why sporting events and all these and (53:54 - 53:59)
concerts are so infectious because you (53:57 - 54:01)
are surrounded by energy (53:59 - 54:04)
of other people yes i i will say that (54:01 - 54:06)
there there can be for a number of (54:04 - 54:08)
people (54:06 - 54:10)
a good experience being in a crowd of (54:08 - 54:12)
like-minded people (54:10 - 54:14)
there's also a number of people that (54:12 - 54:16)
that is a huge (54:14 - 54:18)
absolutely (54:16 - 54:22)
not situation so like that that like it (54:18 - 54:24)
is it is a thing that can sell community (54:22 - 54:27)
days if if you find comfort and energy (54:24 - 54:30)
in that situation and i will say (54:27 - 54:32)
probably a majority of people (54:30 - 54:35)
do because humans are hurt animals (54:32 - 54:36)
um so (54:35 - 54:38)
it's a safe bet that being around (54:36 - 54:40)
like-minded people who are also excited (54:38 - 54:42)
will get you excited (54:40 - 54:45)
it is not a for sure bet but yes sure (54:42 - 54:48)
yeah so i wanted to give my (54:45 - 54:50)
variance on that interpretation because (54:48 - 54:52)
i there were a lot of people who took (54:50 - 54:55)
the discussion last week as (54:52 - 54:57)
uh community day is free intended for (54:55 - 55:00)
you to talk to strangers yes i think a (54:57 - 55:01)
lot of people came away thinking that (55:00 - 55:04)
and and i i don't think that that's the (55:01 - 55:05)
case at all (55:04 - 55:08)
i also don't think that community day is (55:05 - 55:11)
you have to be enmeshed in a crowd of (55:08 - 55:13)
other people (55:11 - 55:16)
it's just the way that pokemon go works (55:13 - 55:19)
is you can be experiencing the event at (55:16 - 55:22)
the same time as other people who are (55:19 - 55:24)
relatively nearby (55:22 - 55:26)
without having to be in the middle of (55:24 - 55:26)
them (55:26 - 55:30)
and you benefit from that experience (55:26 - 55:30)
also in no way am i like defending (55:31 - 55:35)
niantic's six to three-hour choice i'm (55:33 - 55:36)
just like (55:35 - 55:38)
i just thought that point kind of got (55:36 - 55:40)
lost i do think that like forcing people (55:38 - 55:42)
to play together does force this sense (55:40 - 55:44)
of community whether you're talking to (55:42 - 55:46)
people or not but for because it's it (55:44 - 55:48)
forces more people to be having the (55:46 - 55:50)
experience at the same time i don't (55:48 - 55:52)
think it forces a sense of community i (55:50 - 55:55)
think it forces the perspective of you (55:52 - 55:58)
benefit from yeah yeah i think i think (55:55 - 56:01)
it's easier to see hey (55:58 - 56:02)
having all these people here is (56:01 - 56:04)
benefiting me whether i want to interact (56:02 - 56:08)
or not i also i i do also want to say (56:04 - 56:09)
though because the person did bring up (56:08 - 56:11)
like we used to have great community (56:09 - 56:13)
days and then they released all of these (56:11 - 56:15)
things and now oh people only want to do (56:13 - 56:16)
it at home (56:15 - 56:17)
that (56:16 - 56:20)
that sign that is a sign that your game (56:17 - 56:21)
isn't that fun (56:20 - 56:23)
if people would rather (56:21 - 56:26)
pay to bypass the hassle that you (56:23 - 56:29)
created because they can get a very (56:26 - 56:31)
similar experience from it that is a (56:29 - 56:33)
problem of the game (56:31 - 56:35)
yeah well let me say two things to that (56:33 - 56:38)
right yeah because greg you would rather (56:35 - 56:41)
use speed tickets to play pokemon (56:38 - 56:44)
masters and just get through it (56:41 - 56:45)
that says a lot about the gameplay of (56:44 - 56:48)
pokemon masters now doesn't it yeah uh (56:45 - 56:49)
but the other skills are partnered with (56:48 - 56:52)
dna i mean here's the thing (56:49 - 56:55)
i play the game for the new content but (56:52 - 56:57)
when they force me to do old content (56:55 - 56:59)
yeah i don't want to prove again that i (56:57 - 57:00)
know how to do this (56:59 - 57:02)
and there was also i saw one somebody (57:00 - 57:04)
commented that they they felt bad (57:02 - 57:06)
playing pokemon go because they felt (57:04 - 57:09)
like people thought it was weird to see (57:06 - 57:10)
them walking around looking at their (57:09 - 57:12)
phone (57:10 - 57:15)
let me speak directly to you friend (57:12 - 57:17)
everybody in the world is walking around (57:15 - 57:20)
looking at their phone nobody knows what (57:17 - 57:21)
you're doing on there they're going to (57:20 - 57:24)
assume 2022 that you're watching tick (57:21 - 57:26)
tocks yep so (57:24 - 57:28)
just don't nobody's paying attention to (57:26 - 57:30)
you it's it's the gym myth it doesn't (57:28 - 57:32)
matter how badly you're doing at the gym (57:30 - 57:34)
nobody's paying attention to you (57:32 - 57:36)
everybody at the gym is a big old (57:34 - 57:37)
narcissist just paying attention to (57:36 - 57:41)
their own lives and their gym crush and (57:37 - 57:42)
if you're that concerned you're probably (57:41 - 57:44)
not their gym crush so don't worry about (57:42 - 57:45)
it (57:44 - 57:48)
i want to be somebody's gym crush (57:45 - 57:51)
go to the gym first oh boy (57:48 - 57:53)
i (57:51 - 57:53)
was so worried (57:53 - 57:58)
last week that uh (57:55 - 58:00)
we would get the message wrong (57:58 - 58:01)
myself in particular i'm never worried (58:00 - 58:03)
about greg greg is very good with words (58:01 - 58:05)
um (58:03 - 58:06)
uh (58:05 - 58:09)
and i i don't ever want to come off as (58:06 - 58:12)
like ableist you know in any way and i (58:09 - 58:14)
but i do i like know that you know i'm (58:12 - 58:15)
very healthy (58:14 - 58:18)
i i do like to walk i i said this last (58:15 - 58:19)
week i am like niantic's perfect (58:18 - 58:21)
customer minus that you know i've (58:19 - 58:24)
refused to buy eggs for mail to land it (58:21 - 58:27)
um but like i am the customer they want (58:24 - 58:28)
the customer that's very willing to go (58:27 - 58:32)
outside in in heat in cold in rain like (58:28 - 58:34)
will and i played a whole day of pokemon (58:32 - 58:37)
go in the rain um and it was a great (58:34 - 58:38)
experience (58:37 - 58:40)
uh (58:38 - 58:42)
and there was a there was a couple (58:40 - 58:44)
comments that were like how much (58:42 - 58:47)
accessibility is is too much (58:44 - 58:49)
and yeah that (58:47 - 58:52)
that and the the they're going to walk (58:49 - 58:53)
away from the ledge because that made me (58:52 - 58:54)
really angry (58:53 - 58:56)
though (58:54 - 58:58)
i i think they were joking but like (58:56 - 59:01)
the comment was like uh when is niantic (58:58 - 59:03)
gonna make the game better for blind (59:01 - 59:05)
people and (59:03 - 59:07)
i i'm actually sure that there is (59:05 - 59:11)
probably a way to play it with the (59:07 - 59:13)
features that are on ios or android i'm (59:11 - 59:14)
sure there's a way to play it (59:13 - 59:17)
that comment made me (59:14 - 59:20)
furious because here's here's the here's (59:17 - 59:22)
the thing that had that that that said (59:20 - 59:23)
about books (59:22 - 59:25)
well they can't see the words so why (59:23 - 59:27)
should any book be translated into (59:25 - 59:29)
braille (59:27 - 59:31)
people who are deaf can't hear movies so (59:29 - 59:33)
why should there be closed captioning it (59:31 - 59:35)
ruins my experience by seeing words on (59:33 - 59:36)
the screen (59:35 - 59:39)
the idea that because we can't (59:36 - 59:42)
conceptualize how that would work for a (59:39 - 59:45)
person means it's not worth doing at all (59:42 - 59:46)
infuriates me (59:45 - 59:47)
it took (59:46 - 59:51)
years years for people to get braille on (59:47 - 59:53)
cash machines (59:51 - 59:55)
to make people who have different (59:53 - 59:58)
abilities (59:55 - 60:00)
i feel independent and a part of society (59:58 - 60:02)
so you can say oh it's just a game they (60:00 - 60:04)
can't see it anyways that can be applied (60:02 - 60:06)
to books they don't need to read books (60:04 - 60:08)
for fun they don't need to have a full (60:06 - 60:11)
life of independence because it's too (60:08 - 60:13)
hard for us and it costs us money to (60:11 - 60:14)
include them (60:13 - 60:16)
these people who aren't going to get the (60:14 - 60:19)
same enjoyment out of me out of it that (60:16 - 60:22)
in that mindset makes me (60:19 - 60:26)
angry because that has held back (60:22 - 60:28)
ramps to get into places it has held (60:26 - 60:29)
back (60:28 - 60:31)
the crosswalks that talk to let people (60:29 - 60:34)
who are blind know it's safe to cross (60:31 - 60:37)
the street it's held back so many things (60:34 - 60:38)
because well (60:37 - 60:40)
it's such a small people use and they (60:38 - 60:42)
barely use it at all it's not worth (60:40 - 60:44)
giving them independence or access (60:42 - 60:46)
it's just (60:44 - 60:49)
well but also right going along with (60:46 - 60:51)
that greg it's also a false argument (60:49 - 60:52)
because (60:51 - 60:53)
it is not (60:52 - 60:55)
a dichotomy it is not a perfect (60:53 - 60:58)
dichotomy there is such a thing as (60:55 - 61:01)
losing your sight or extremely poor (60:58 - 61:03)
eyesight and guess what the older i get (61:01 - 61:05)
the more i fall into that category and (61:03 - 61:08)
guess what braille helps people who have (61:05 - 61:10)
poor eyesight as well who can be mobile (61:08 - 61:11)
i mean (61:10 - 61:14)
closed captioning helps me as my your my (61:11 - 61:16)
hearing is getting better exactly like (61:14 - 61:19)
you can be a you can be steve a perfect (61:16 - 61:21)
walking individual whose favorite game (61:19 - 61:23)
is pokemon go steve gets hit by the (61:21 - 61:27)
light rail and can no longer walk (61:23 - 61:29)
that's true that could happen (61:27 - 61:31)
then what (61:29 - 61:33)
then it would be it would be very hard (61:31 - 61:34)
for me to play (61:33 - 61:37)
this game i love so much right (61:34 - 61:38)
um and (61:37 - 61:40)
and asking a company and people just (61:38 - 61:42)
consider your perspective and they turn (61:40 - 61:44)
a deaf ear to you and people say things (61:42 - 61:46)
like well it was never designed for you (61:44 - 61:47)
it was designed for you before your (61:46 - 61:51)
unfortunate accident but that's how life (61:47 - 61:53)
yeah so yeah we're moving on (61:51 - 61:55)
and there are ways that you can play (61:53 - 61:59)
like there are sound cues in (61:55 - 62:01)
go you can hear (61:59 - 62:03)
the cries you can hear the clicks you (62:01 - 62:06)
can hear things they could add things to (62:03 - 62:08)
make it accessible (62:06 - 62:10)
more accessible people who can't see to (62:08 - 62:12)
in still enjoy the game because you (62:10 - 62:14)
can't envision it doesn't mean they (62:12 - 62:17)
should be cut out (62:14 - 62:21)
yeah yeah i i it did make me think (62:17 - 62:22)
and i'm just bringing this up as an (62:21 - 62:24)
example because uh because i there was a (62:22 - 62:27)
conversation on a different video game (62:24 - 62:28)
podcast (62:27 - 62:30)
a couple years ago (62:28 - 62:31)
and it brought me back to this (62:30 - 62:33)
conversation about accessibility (62:31 - 62:35)
and there's this game that i absolutely (62:33 - 62:37)
love it's probably actually legit like a (62:35 - 62:39)
top five video game for me of all time i (62:37 - 62:40)
don't think i've maybe only talked about (62:39 - 62:42)
it once it's called the witness (62:40 - 62:43)
oh yeah (62:42 - 62:46)
and it's it's this is this brilliant (62:43 - 62:47)
puzzle game (62:46 - 62:50)
and it has like seven different parts of (62:47 - 62:53)
an island just the the island you get to (62:50 - 62:54)
this island you don't know what's (62:53 - 62:56)
happening it's very mysterious there's (62:54 - 62:58)
like these notes left everywhere there's (62:56 - 63:01)
a lot of like mindfulness notes and like (62:58 - 63:04)
like eventually you'll get to the path (63:01 - 63:05)
there's like obviously a character used (63:04 - 63:07)
to live on this island so you're trying (63:05 - 63:09)
to figure out who this character is (63:07 - 63:11)
i'm not going to spoil it but the whole (63:09 - 63:13)
game is puzzles and there are different (63:11 - 63:16)
types of puzzles and just like in super (63:13 - 63:18)
mario 64 you don't need to do everything (63:16 - 63:20)
to get to the end of the game you can (63:18 - 63:24)
um but you you have to do maybe like (63:20 - 63:25)
five out of seven of the islands or (63:24 - 63:27)
something like that or areas like you (63:25 - 63:29)
don't have to do all of them (63:27 - 63:31)
and (63:29 - 63:32)
there's (63:31 - 63:34)
a part of the island where all of the (63:32 - 63:37)
puzzles are are (63:34 - 63:39)
sound based (63:37 - 63:42)
and i couldn't do any of them like i (63:39 - 63:44)
don't know if (63:42 - 63:45)
not (63:44 - 63:47)
i i i'm just dumb right like i just (63:45 - 63:49)
can't like (63:47 - 63:51)
you don't have a tonal ear right yeah i (63:49 - 63:53)
can't i can't hear different tones yeah (63:51 - 63:55)
you're not musically inclined tone tones (63:53 - 63:57)
are lost on you i just couldn't do any (63:55 - 63:59)
of them um but it doesn't it didn't (63:57 - 64:01)
prevent me from like beating the game (63:59 - 64:02)
because i just went to a different aisle (64:01 - 64:04)
but i loved this game so much i did want (64:02 - 64:06)
to try to like 100 and i just couldn't (64:04 - 64:07)
because like some of the puzzles were (64:06 - 64:08)
legit hard there's another part of the (64:07 - 64:10)
island and this is more the more (64:08 - 64:12)
accessibility part (64:10 - 64:15)
which is all colors (64:12 - 64:18)
and there it's it's like this greenhouse (64:15 - 64:19)
and (64:18 - 64:20)
the (64:19 - 64:22)
the different types of like it's a (64:20 - 64:24)
greenhouse but also there's like a glass (64:22 - 64:26)
house of red and a glass house of yellow (64:24 - 64:27)
and glass house of green and when the (64:26 - 64:30)
light goes through there's these plants (64:27 - 64:32)
and everything is (64:30 - 64:34)
every puzzle is based off mixing colors (64:32 - 64:36)
and having other colors this game (64:34 - 64:39)
doesn't have a colorblind mode (64:36 - 64:42)
and i i do know plenty of i do know a (64:39 - 64:43)
handful of people that are colorblind (64:42 - 64:45)
and they it would be impossible for them (64:43 - 64:48)
to do that part of the island and uh (64:45 - 64:51)
that part of the island got flack (64:48 - 64:52)
because (64:51 - 64:55)
it wasn't accessible like if just like i (64:52 - 64:56)
couldn't do the the music part of the (64:55 - 64:58)
island you colorblind people couldn't do (64:56 - 65:00)
that part of the island so i guess the (64:58 - 65:02)
argument would be like (65:00 - 65:04)
how if if you (65:02 - 65:07)
make that part excel if you (65:04 - 65:09)
make that (65:07 - 65:11)
how do i word this (65:09 - 65:13)
the whole point of that island is to (65:11 - 65:15)
mix the colors (65:13 - 65:17)
and so if you take it away do you take (65:15 - 65:20)
away the goal of what that island like (65:17 - 65:21)
that part is (65:20 - 65:23)
when they did technically design the (65:21 - 65:25)
game where you don't have to do it right (65:23 - 65:27)
you can do the other islands and still (65:25 - 65:29)
see the ending of the game but like if (65:27 - 65:31)
you do make that quote-unquote more (65:29 - 65:32)
accessible i'm really sorry i don't know (65:31 - 65:35)
the correct wording then does that ruin (65:32 - 65:37)
the experience for what you originally (65:35 - 65:39)
designed it for which is for so the (65:37 - 65:41)
question is is is (65:39 - 65:46)
are the color choices so important (65:41 - 65:48)
that if they were switched to a color (65:46 - 65:51)
blind safe palette (65:48 - 65:52)
that would have radically altered that (65:51 - 65:54)
like right is it so important that it's (65:52 - 65:57)
red yellow and green that it couldn't (65:54 - 65:58)
have been (65:57 - 66:00)
red (65:58 - 66:01)
blue triangle (66:00 - 66:04)
or whatever the there's like three (66:01 - 66:05)
whichever i forget what the other one is (66:04 - 66:08)
depending on your color right like (66:05 - 66:11)
and that that's part of the (66:08 - 66:13)
problem is when people look at those (66:11 - 66:14)
things and say well color is so (66:13 - 66:17)
important (66:14 - 66:20)
it is especially to people who can't see (66:17 - 66:23)
it but but also it's also a problem with (66:20 - 66:25)
people who have face blindness face (66:23 - 66:27)
blindness is very common there are (66:25 - 66:29)
people who cannot literally (66:27 - 66:31)
see people's faces (66:29 - 66:33)
and remember them so if you have (66:31 - 66:36)
portraits that don't have other (66:33 - 66:39)
signifying things people can't do that (66:36 - 66:41)
either and it would be easy to add (66:39 - 66:44)
a simple color palette switch an option (66:41 - 66:47)
to turn on colorblind mode an option on (66:44 - 66:50)
the tonal islands to add a symbol or the (66:47 - 66:53)
notes or the frequency meter like (66:50 - 66:56)
there's little tweaks you can add to (66:53 - 66:57)
make them accessible (66:56 - 66:59)
that you just don't because your brain (66:57 - 67:03)
is locked into color is so important (66:59 - 67:06)
why why is that shade important or is it (67:03 - 67:08)
just that you want them to mix in a (67:06 - 67:10)
certain way that you think is pretty (67:08 - 67:12)
aesthetic right or just like (67:10 - 67:15)
use your creativity to design (67:12 - 67:17)
if if you have to do a colorblind mode (67:15 - 67:20)
that is an equivalent puzzle (67:17 - 67:22)
that doesn't rely on color (67:20 - 67:24)
in just in some some way (67:22 - 67:25)
i mean (67:24 - 67:27)
colorblind people can see mixtures of (67:25 - 67:29)
color you just have to pick the right (67:27 - 67:30)
palette it's not (67:29 - 67:35)
it is just it is a simple mindset of (67:30 - 67:37)
we didn't think about it and when we're (67:35 - 67:39)
called out on it we get defensive about (67:37 - 67:40)
it (67:39 - 67:42)
because oh it's too hard and there's so (67:40 - 67:44)
few people and why would you and it (67:42 - 67:47)
ruins the aesthetic of our game (67:44 - 67:50)
you're just being defensive (67:47 - 67:52)
yeah i think i think the creator was (67:50 - 67:54)
asked why there was no colorblind mode (67:52 - 67:55)
and they were like we thought about it (67:54 - 67:57)
and that's why we didn't make the gate i (67:55 - 67:58)
think they said something like that's (67:57 - 68:00)
why you can just skip that like if it's (67:58 - 68:02)
too hard there's we we made so many (68:00 - 68:04)
puzzles that (68:02 - 68:05)
you don't have to worry about doing (68:04 - 68:06)
these (68:05 - 68:07)
and you can still see the end of the (68:06 - 68:10)
game because the end of the game that is (68:07 - 68:12)
definitely a way around it and it kind (68:10 - 68:14)
of needs to be like (68:12 - 68:17)
that should be a part of the game (68:14 - 68:19)
like where it's where it explains that (68:17 - 68:20)
clearly (68:19 - 68:22)
you don't have to do this these islands (68:20 - 68:24)
are optional and only for this (68:22 - 68:26)
completion (68:24 - 68:28)
for a completionist and move on like as (68:26 - 68:31)
long as that's spelled out but if (68:28 - 68:33)
if your game and the plotline is (68:31 - 68:35)
designed that you are (68:33 - 68:38)
you are left with a feeling of i'm not (68:35 - 68:40)
completing the game because i can't do (68:38 - 68:40)
this (68:40 - 68:43)
that is a very different feeling than (68:40 - 68:46)
this is very optional it won't affect my (68:43 - 68:47)
gameplay (68:46 - 68:49)
yeah (68:47 - 68:50)
but i think going back to the the (68:49 - 68:53)
niantic stuff i think why you get so (68:50 - 68:56)
many people that are that are mad is (68:53 - 68:56)
because (68:56 - 68:59)
the (68:56 - 69:00)
the game (68:59 - 69:02)
it's literally what greg said earlier (69:00 - 69:05)
like i am a perfect customer i've been (69:02 - 69:06)
playing this game for five years i (69:05 - 69:09)
suddenly get hit by the light rail (69:06 - 69:11)
i can now not play the game how i used (69:09 - 69:12)
to play it (69:11 - 69:16)
and what niantic did over (69:12 - 69:16)
the (69:17 - 69:20)
course of the last two years of the (69:18 - 69:22)
pandemic was made it possible for anyone (69:20 - 69:25)
to play at home and then so new players (69:22 - 69:28)
got in and they fell in love with this (69:25 - 69:31)
game and now niantic is saying (69:28 - 69:34)
okay your time's up (69:31 - 69:36)
thanks for the money where is honestly (69:34 - 69:38)
if they would have never done that you (69:36 - 69:41)
would have probably not heard such an (69:38 - 69:43)
outcry (69:41 - 69:45)
because those players were already not (69:43 - 69:46)
playing the game there would have (69:45 - 69:48)
probably we probably still would have (69:46 - 69:50)
gotten to this point of like hey when is (69:48 - 69:52)
niantic gonna get (69:50 - 69:52)
more (69:52 - 69:54)
like accessible but (69:52 - 69:55)
um (69:54 - 69:57)
the people that you're hearing from and (69:55 - 69:59)
the people that were were were trying to (69:57 - 70:01)
be voices for (69:59 - 70:04)
like they got in because niantic made it (70:01 - 70:05)
accessible (70:04 - 70:07)
and then they took they're now taking it (70:05 - 70:08)
away yeah it's also frustrating when you (70:07 - 70:12)
see a company that can do the thing (70:08 - 70:13)
and (70:12 - 70:15)
shows that they've been able to do this (70:13 - 70:17)
all along and then for it's like it's (70:15 - 70:19)
like working from home and suddenly (70:17 - 70:20)
everybody's saying well you have to come (70:19 - 70:22)
back to the office nothing changed maybe (70:20 - 70:25)
working out things were better (70:22 - 70:27)
and for no reason you want me to come (70:25 - 70:28)
into the office why (70:27 - 70:30)
it's it is the fact that when they show (70:28 - 70:32)
that they can (70:30 - 70:35)
with some effort but still flourish (70:32 - 70:38)
and then pull that away for no reason (70:35 - 70:41)
that that is a very salty move (70:38 - 70:43)
it is just sour (70:41 - 70:45)
which which again is what i will say (70:43 - 70:48)
last week say it again this week (70:45 - 70:48)
if people want to play at home and they (70:49 - 70:52)
want to they want to spend the 50 cents (70:50 - 70:54)
and they want to spend the dollars for (70:52 - 70:56)
the remote raid passes and they they (70:54 - 70:57)
want they're okay with the spawns in (70:56 - 70:59)
their house (70:57 - 71:00)
that's cool (70:59 - 71:02)
whatever you do you play the game how (71:00 - 71:05)
you want to play it but like it it just (71:02 - 71:08)
because niantic feels the need to punish (71:05 - 71:09)
everyone (71:08 - 71:11)
yeah that's that's the frustrating part (71:09 - 71:14)
like i'm going outside niantic i'm going (71:11 - 71:15)
to the parks i'm going to your (71:14 - 71:19)
communities why am i getting (71:15 - 71:20)
why are you punishing everyone like (71:19 - 71:22)
reward if you want people to go outside (71:20 - 71:24)
reward those people yeah (71:22 - 71:26)
make those people feel like they're like (71:24 - 71:27)
yes we're playing the game you want to (71:26 - 71:29)
play people like (71:27 - 71:30)
how would you like there's so many ways (71:29 - 71:32)
to do it if you wanted if you wanted (71:30 - 71:35)
people to walk make rare spawns happen (71:32 - 71:37)
more often when you're walking through (71:35 - 71:41)
incense than at home so if a rare spawn (71:37 - 71:43)
chance is one in a hundred at home make (71:41 - 71:46)
it one in 50 if you're walking so that (71:43 - 71:48)
there's actually a visible benefit to (71:46 - 71:50)
hey if i walk around i still get it at (71:48 - 71:53)
home just not as often but i'm rewarded (71:50 - 71:56)
for doing what you want me to do (71:53 - 71:56)
i mean there's a lot of ways to sort of (71:56 - 72:01)
get around it and like people and i (71:58 - 72:02)
think what also people are like well how (72:01 - 72:05)
would you do like i it's not my job to (72:02 - 72:06)
sit here and try to think through every (72:05 - 72:08)
scenario like if you hired me and gave (72:06 - 72:10)
me a week to say come up with solutions (72:08 - 72:13)
i absolutely could i can't in a two-hour (72:10 - 72:16)
podcast solve for x (72:13 - 72:18)
but i don't know and i'm not allowed to (72:16 - 72:20)
know what all the egg things are no free (72:18 - 72:22)
art contest we're not solving problems (72:20 - 72:24)
for big big money companies (72:22 - 72:26)
the the last thing i wanted to say based (72:24 - 72:29)
off last week's conversation was i i do (72:26 - 72:32)
genuinely think pokemon go is a bad game (72:29 - 72:35)
for for everyone who plays at home (72:32 - 72:37)
um and (72:35 - 72:39)
i think maybe the writing on the wall is (72:37 - 72:40)
that's definitely intentional from (72:39 - 72:42)
niantic now (72:40 - 72:44)
but like (72:42 - 72:44)
if you (72:45 - 72:49)
cannot leave your house for whatever (72:47 - 72:52)
reason um (72:49 - 72:56)
and your choices is is pokemon go or any (72:52 - 72:58)
other free-to-play game i just think the (72:56 - 73:01)
value for pogo is bad (72:58 - 73:02)
and (73:01 - 73:05)
for me i can compare pogo which is a (73:02 - 73:06)
free-to-play game to another (73:05 - 73:08)
free-to-play game i'm going to use apex (73:06 - 73:11)
legends both are free and you're 150 (73:08 - 73:12)
dollars (73:11 - 73:14)
of bad packs (73:12 - 73:15)
so (73:14 - 73:17)
for for anyone at home (73:15 - 73:20)
think uh take pokemon go if you play it (73:17 - 73:21)
and then think of literally any other (73:20 - 73:23)
free to play game whether that's like (73:21 - 73:24)
clash royale (73:23 - 73:27)
garden scapes pokemon tonight (73:24 - 73:29)
uh project night (73:27 - 73:31)
what was what was that project makeover (73:29 - 73:35)
was the greatest forever fortnight um (73:31 - 73:37)
literally there's uh like we we could (73:35 - 73:40)
spend five hours listing very popular (73:37 - 73:41)
free to play games right (73:40 - 73:43)
i'm going to use apex legends for this (73:41 - 73:45)
example but again you at home pick (73:43 - 73:47)
whatever other free to play game (73:45 - 73:48)
in (73:47 - 73:51)
in apex legends i can start up the game (73:48 - 73:54)
i have almost all the legends i have (73:51 - 73:56)
like half the roster of legends unlocked (73:54 - 73:59)
i can pick that legend i can drop in and (73:56 - 74:01)
i can have a great experience my match (73:59 - 74:03)
could be 45 seconds because i could die (74:01 - 74:04)
right away but then i could just drop (74:03 - 74:06)
back in my match could be 40 minutes and (74:04 - 74:08)
i could make it to the end and be like (74:06 - 74:10)
top three in the circle there's also (74:08 - 74:12)
different game modes in apex legends i (74:10 - 74:14)
can play battle royale i can play battle (74:12 - 74:19)
royale ranked i can play i can play um (74:14 - 74:22)
uh arenas which is three verse three i (74:19 - 74:24)
can play control which is nine verse (74:22 - 74:26)
nine like there's different modes i can (74:24 - 74:28)
play when i'm playing i can unlock (74:26 - 74:30)
resources to unlock other characters for (74:28 - 74:34)
free i can unlock loot boxes like i get (74:30 - 74:37)
all of that without spending a dollar (74:34 - 74:38)
right (74:37 - 74:40)
and i get all of that (74:38 - 74:44)
in a very compact experience in pogo (74:40 - 74:47)
i open up the game and i have the spawns (74:44 - 74:49)
that are in my house i'm gonna maybe say (74:47 - 74:51)
let's say i have five or six spawns i (74:49 - 74:53)
can catch those spawns and then my (74:51 - 74:55)
experience is done (74:53 - 74:58)
that's it i could (74:55 - 75:01)
remote into a raid (74:58 - 75:02)
that's a dollar (75:01 - 75:05)
i could pop an incense and let's say the (75:02 - 75:07)
incense was one spawn a minute what it (75:05 - 75:08)
used to be (75:07 - 75:11)
i could pop an incense that's 50 cents (75:08 - 75:15)
and now for 90 minutes i get to (75:11 - 75:17)
wait for a pokemon to spawn in for a (75:15 - 75:20)
minute throw a pokeball hope i have 1 90 (75:17 - 75:23)
pokeballs and then catch it and then my (75:20 - 75:26)
experience is over (75:23 - 75:26)
like just it's just so hard for me to (75:28 - 75:33)
like say this game here wants 50 cent (75:30 - 75:36)
minimum at an at-home experience (75:33 - 75:38)
for 90 minutes and this game over here (75:36 - 75:40)
the game i'm using apex legends you can (75:38 - 75:42)
use pokemon unite or whatever other game (75:40 - 75:46)
offers me so much for free (75:42 - 75:48)
it's just to me it's very jarring like i (75:46 - 75:49)
just (75:48 - 75:51)
like i don't want to be like i don't (75:49 - 75:53)
want to tell people who are (75:51 - 75:55)
who can't leave their house to be like (75:53 - 75:57)
scream at them to play another game i (75:55 - 76:00)
get why they play poke pogo like (75:57 - 76:02)
i love pogo and the reason like i get (76:00 - 76:05)
why people love pogo but like (76:02 - 76:07)
it's just a (76:05 - 76:11)
at its core it's such a bad game (76:07 - 76:13)
that like it just because because once (76:11 - 76:15)
you go out (76:13 - 76:17)
outside and you see the pokestops and (76:15 - 76:18)
you see the gyms and the spawns are (76:17 - 76:20)
happening and all that like that's where (76:18 - 76:23)
the game really shines (76:20 - 76:23)
and at home (76:24 - 76:27)
whether it's intentional or not niantic (76:25 - 76:30)
is making it a bad experience to push (76:27 - 76:32)
you outside (76:30 - 76:35)
and that's why i'm just like don't give (76:32 - 76:37)
like don't give niantic money for that (76:35 - 76:39)
at home but i get it like if that's if (76:37 - 76:41)
that's the game you like and you don't (76:39 - 76:43)
have kids (76:41 - 76:45)
and you don't you know all your bills (76:43 - 76:47)
are paid you're in no credit card debt (76:45 - 76:49)
you got money to burn and this is the (76:47 - 76:51)
at-home experience you want (76:49 - 76:53)
i get it but like i just feel like (76:51 - 76:54)
there's (76:53 - 76:56)
the the amount of what other free to (76:54 - 76:59)
play games offer for the like time (76:56 - 77:03)
put in is just so vast and (76:59 - 77:04)
honestly like (77:03 - 77:07)
they are different games like like one (77:04 - 77:09)
is theoretically a walking game and apex (77:07 - 77:11)
legends in this example is not a walking (77:09 - 77:14)
game right it's a shooter it's (77:11 - 77:15)
but (77:14 - 77:17)
i will say this the good thing is there (77:15 - 77:20)
are other pokemon experiences now right (77:17 - 77:23)
there's unite which (77:20 - 77:25)
look i i'm back into masters and masters (77:23 - 77:29)
1400 your boy is competitive recognizes (77:25 - 77:31)
ruining lives but there's also a (77:29 - 77:35)
collection aspect in pokemon masters now (77:31 - 77:37)
and masters has vastly improved their (77:35 - 77:40)
reward system (77:37 - 77:42)
i think they have vastly improved their (77:40 - 77:44)
storyline writing i i think (77:42 - 77:47)
that (77:44 - 77:47)
where masters started to really flirt (77:48 - 77:51)
with (77:50 - 77:52)
uh (77:51 - 77:55)
they pay a lot of money to get the best (77:52 - 77:57)
things and that there's an aspect to it (77:55 - 77:59)
i think they've also sort of realized (77:57 - 78:01)
that they need to be a bit more generous (77:59 - 78:03)
since the game is now about collecting (78:01 - 78:05)
pairs that they need to let people who (78:03 - 78:07)
don't want to pay money collect pairs (78:05 - 78:09)
more often and i think masters is in a (78:07 - 78:11)
much better (78:09 - 78:13)
spot that they gave you things for free (78:11 - 78:15)
and they have now (78:13 - 78:18)
on the 25th of every day is the 25th (78:15 - 78:19)
yeah yeah (78:18 - 78:20)
their master day (78:19 - 78:24)
they have really sort of ramped up that (78:20 - 78:27)
it's more fun to collect in this game (78:24 - 78:29)
and i think it's a good alternate if you (78:27 - 78:31)
like collecting aspects that are found (78:29 - 78:34)
and go i think the weird thing about go (78:31 - 78:36)
is like you said is they have gone down (78:34 - 78:38)
this (78:36 - 78:42)
pay for our best experience model (78:38 - 78:43)
that (78:42 - 78:45)
like we say before go fast is their best (78:43 - 78:47)
experience and you have to pay for it (78:45 - 78:49)
they are a pay for their best experience (78:47 - 78:52)
game (78:49 - 78:52)
yeah (78:55 - 78:57)
and i i still i i i flipped on my view (78:57 - 79:03)
last week and i made a joke last week of (79:01 - 79:05)
like i wonder if how much of the pokemon (79:03 - 79:07)
company is like (79:05 - 79:11)
we don't want people to play at home (79:07 - 79:12)
because we (79:11 - 79:15)
we have those games for people to play (79:12 - 79:17)
at home like make your game different (79:15 - 79:19)
niantic this is too close to the sun for (79:17 - 79:22)
us (79:19 - 79:24)
and greg was like no i believe that and (79:22 - 79:26)
now like after thinking about it was (79:24 - 79:28)
like (79:26 - 79:28)
why like niantic gets easy money doing (79:29 - 79:33)
it uh-huh (79:31 - 79:35)
they get easy money like if you want to (79:33 - 79:36)
sit at home and not leave and pay 50 (79:35 - 79:39)
cents every 90 minutes (79:36 - 79:43)
why would niantic say no to that (79:39 - 79:43)
like like like it's not a great (79:44 - 79:48)
experience for 50 cents it is definitely (79:46 - 79:49)
an experience it's definitely an (79:48 - 79:51)
experience now you've uncovered the (79:49 - 79:53)
illuminati (79:51 - 79:53)
the (79:53 - 79:57)
the secret conspiracy behind the whole (79:53 - 79:58)
but also there's like parts of me that (79:57 - 80:02)
that is like i i rarely will buy (79:58 - 80:05)
remote raid passes for (80:02 - 80:07)
anything that isn't five star if it's a (80:05 - 80:09)
five star topo coco (80:07 - 80:11)
i will i will maybe spend two to three (80:09 - 80:13)
dollars on it remote raid pass but no (80:11 - 80:15)
more because like (80:13 - 80:17)
but if it's shiny (80:15 - 80:19)
if it's shiny top of coco which is (80:17 - 80:21)
eventually we'll get but that'll that's (80:19 - 80:23)
a one in 20 chance for shiny i might (80:21 - 80:26)
spend probably 20 on it remote raid (80:23 - 80:28)
passes (80:26 - 80:30)
but then then i think like there's a (80:28 - 80:32)
rock rep down the street i'm not i don't (80:30 - 80:34)
want to pay a dollar for rock ruff it's (80:32 - 80:37)
just rock rough like and and this this (80:34 - 80:38)
is my separation of (80:37 - 80:41)
a dollar for rock rough yeah it could be (80:38 - 80:43)
shiny but a dollar for top of coco (80:41 - 80:45)
could be shiny in the future but also (80:43 - 80:47)
the top of coco just gives me way better (80:45 - 80:49)
rewards more experience more rare candy (80:47 - 80:52)
like if i have a dollar and you know (80:49 - 80:53)
there's going to be a rock rough day (80:52 - 80:54)
right (80:53 - 80:57)
so but like then i think (80:54 - 80:58)
well i could (80:57 - 81:00)
leave my house walk down the street do (80:58 - 81:03)
the rock rough for for free and then (81:00 - 81:04)
walk back (81:03 - 81:07)
and that's like 15 minutes out of my day (81:04 - 81:09)
or i could just remote in and save 15 (81:07 - 81:12)
minutes for a dollar (81:09 - 81:12)
but i i feel like i lose in both (81:12 - 81:17)
situations i mean you do but i mean that (81:15 - 81:19)
was the person who's saying that their (81:17 - 81:20)
their community doesn't want to go out (81:19 - 81:22)
anymore it's because going out isn't (81:20 - 81:24)
particularly fun (81:22 - 81:26)
the experience of me paying a dollar to (81:24 - 81:29)
bypass that and just not waste my time (81:26 - 81:32)
and get it done earlier do you get done (81:29 - 81:34)
with faster that is not a good sign that (81:32 - 81:37)
your game is fun well yeah right the (81:34 - 81:39)
only reason that i was able to complete (81:37 - 81:41)
the ditto (81:39 - 81:43)
research the ditto event (81:41 - 81:44)
is because i have a dog that i was (81:43 - 81:46)
walking (81:44 - 81:48)
and i was out and i was like i'm out (81:46 - 81:50)
here walking in this (81:48 - 81:53)
i'm i'm doing something else i might as (81:50 - 81:55)
well do this while i'm doing something (81:53 - 81:58)
else yeah and i've not ever turned like (81:55 - 82:00)
like when i turn on an incense it's me (81:58 - 82:02)
turning on the incense is like me saying (82:00 - 82:04)
i'm playing this game (82:02 - 82:06)
now for this full time yeah (82:04 - 82:09)
and so like if i was to say hey i'm (82:06 - 82:11)
playing for the next 90 minutes and i'm (82:09 - 82:13)
out walking and i see a rock we're (82:11 - 82:14)
afraid that's going to be like my target (82:13 - 82:16)
i'm going to i'm going to walk over to (82:14 - 82:18)
that rock rough i'm going to do it (82:16 - 82:19)
and then i'm going to keep walking and (82:18 - 82:21)
i'm going to keep exploring which is (82:19 - 82:23)
oddly enough the thing that niantic (82:21 - 82:24)
wants you to do they want you to explore (82:23 - 82:26)
they want you to walk they want you to (82:24 - 82:28)
like form a community (82:26 - 82:30)
but when i'm at home (82:28 - 82:32)
and i'm like i see that rock roof and (82:30 - 82:34)
it's like ah do i want to put my shoes (82:32 - 82:35)
on do i want to put my coat on do i want (82:34 - 82:38)
to walk 15 minutes there do the raid 15 (82:35 - 82:40)
or not 15 maybe like 10. it's like no i (82:38 - 82:42)
don't that that 20 minutes of my time is (82:40 - 82:45)
not worth it if i was to like turn on an (82:42 - 82:47)
incense walk and then plan to walk some (82:45 - 82:49)
more it would be worth it but like in (82:47 - 82:51)
that's that specific situation of like (82:49 - 82:53)
do i want to leave for a rock riff and (82:51 - 82:55)
then come back (82:53 - 82:56)
i would rather spend the dollar (82:55 - 82:58)
but because i'm going to save 20 minutes (82:56 - 83:00)
of my day (82:58 - 83:02)
but also i don't want to spend the (83:00 - 83:03)
dollar because i don't want to give (83:02 - 83:06)
niantic a dollar for rock riff (83:03 - 83:07)
i think the problem with where pokemon (83:06 - 83:12)
go is as a game is (83:07 - 83:12)
playing it isn't particularly fun and (83:12 - 83:16)
the things you do in the game are (83:15 - 83:18)
because (83:16 - 83:21)
it makes more sense to do it (83:18 - 83:24)
as an opportunity i have to go for an (83:21 - 83:26)
hour walk i might as well turn on an (83:24 - 83:28)
incense to make this game more (83:26 - 83:31)
worthwhile having open on my hour walk (83:28 - 83:34)
but if i wasn't planning that hour walk (83:31 - 83:36)
if i didn't have to walk to a store if i (83:34 - 83:38)
didn't have to walk to a meeting this (83:36 - 83:39)
game would not get opened (83:38 - 83:42)
and that is the problem that go is in (83:39 - 83:44)
right now the way they've designed the (83:42 - 83:45)
game (83:44 - 83:46)
you need to (83:45 - 83:48)
want to do things in it (83:46 - 83:51)
because you're doing something else and (83:48 - 83:53)
community days are a way to say okay i'm (83:51 - 83:55)
going to go (83:53 - 83:57)
carve out a chunk of my time because the (83:55 - 83:59)
rewards are so good and i know (83:57 - 84:01)
my friends are going to do it but if i'm (83:59 - 84:03)
playing the game on my own (84:01 - 84:04)
heck no (84:03 - 84:06)
if i was at your house if will and i (84:04 - 84:08)
were at our house and we saw a rock roof (84:06 - 84:10)
down the street that's an easier (84:08 - 84:11)
decision let's go walk there because (84:10 - 84:13)
we're walking together we're having a (84:11 - 84:15)
good time we're spending time together (84:13 - 84:17)
and then coming back just the only thing (84:15 - 84:20)
at steve's house is a little pup i tried (84:17 - 84:22)
last night real hard (84:20 - 84:25)
but but if we if you're alone the game (84:22 - 84:26)
isn't worth it (84:25 - 84:28)
and then you can you can definitely make (84:26 - 84:29)
the game worth it if you're alone like i (84:28 - 84:31)
have definitely had situations where (84:29 - 84:33)
like i had a rough day i just wanna walk (84:31 - 84:35)
like i wanna i wanna i need a reason to (84:33 - 84:37)
leave my i literally need reasons to (84:35 - 84:38)
leave my house at this point i work i (84:37 - 84:39)
work all day in front of this computer (84:38 - 84:41)
so it's like i'm gonna go to mall of (84:39 - 84:43)
america because it's cold outside i'm (84:41 - 84:45)
gonna do like three laps which is which (84:43 - 84:47)
is an hour i'm gonna listen to a podcast (84:45 - 84:49)
i'm gonna turn on incense i'm gonna have (84:47 - 84:51)
a great time but i plan for that right (84:49 - 84:53)
it's not like a game like apex legends (84:51 - 84:55)
where i walk downstairs i turn it on i'm (84:53 - 84:57)
instantly having fun (84:55 - 84:59)
and i've committed no (84:57 - 85:00)
i didn't have to go anywhere i didn't (84:59 - 85:03)
have to spend any money it's it's good (85:00 - 85:04)
to go (85:03 - 85:06)
i don't necessarily think that's like a (85:04 - 85:09)
bad thing for a game to be like (85:06 - 85:12)
this game is because you can you can (85:09 - 85:14)
gamify a lot of stuff like there like (85:12 - 85:16)
there's an app called run keeper (85:14 - 85:18)
and that that like (85:16 - 85:19)
it did make (85:18 - 85:21)
running fun for me when i ran when i did (85:19 - 85:23)
run are you thinking run keeper or (85:21 - 85:26)
zombie run (85:23 - 85:28)
well that way runs good run keeper had (85:26 - 85:30)
like you know like the goals and like (85:28 - 85:32)
the like (85:30 - 85:34)
it's the whole apple watch thing of like (85:32 - 85:35)
go out and exercise today and get a (85:34 - 85:37)
medal like okay yeah i mean you have to (85:35 - 85:40)
care about that stuff like gamification (85:37 - 85:41)
believe me i have to do this for my job (85:40 - 85:43)
and (85:41 - 85:46)
a good game a good gamification has (85:43 - 85:48)
multiple (85:46 - 85:49)
rewards (85:48 - 85:52)
that that entice a lot of people so i (85:49 - 85:54)
don't i don't i don't give a hoot about (85:52 - 85:55)
medals i don't give a hoot about (85:54 - 85:57)
collection i don't care about (85:55 - 85:59)
achievements because they mean (85:57 - 86:01)
nothing to me (85:59 - 86:02)
at all (86:01 - 86:03)
uh i (86:02 - 86:06)
get medals for exercising but i could (86:03 - 86:08)
care less like i i don't (86:06 - 86:10)
whatever i used to care about the apple (86:08 - 86:12)
metal system and then i lost half my (86:10 - 86:13)
apple medals and i was like i'm not (86:12 - 86:15)
restarting this it doesn't it's a (86:13 - 86:16)
virtual it's a virtual thing that only (86:15 - 86:19)
matters to you and if you get enjoyment (86:16 - 86:21)
from (86:19 - 86:23)
um (86:21 - 86:24)
from running (86:23 - 86:26)
uh and for metals those are great but (86:24 - 86:28)
you should always have some other reward (86:26 - 86:30)
system (86:28 - 86:30)
yeah (86:32 - 86:36)
what is that bread (86:34 - 86:37)
okay (86:36 - 86:39)
you've been promising bread for an hour (86:37 - 86:41)
and a half i'm i'm starving (86:39 - 86:45)
this is off english.kyodonews.net (86:41 - 86:45)
send this link i don't trust you (86:47 - 86:52)
i know what i'm saying (86:53 - 86:59)
uh a pokemon bread has sparked a craze (86:55 - 87:01)
in south korea on its return to shelves (86:59 - 87:04)
for the first time in two decades driven (87:01 - 87:06)
by many cha many (87:04 - 87:09)
driven mainly by childhood nostalgia of (87:06 - 87:12)
fans of the global hit animation series (87:09 - 87:15)
pocket monsters uh but it is winning new (87:12 - 87:19)
admirers about 4.7 million packs of the (87:15 - 87:20)
bread have been sold in the last month (87:19 - 87:22)
since its return to stores in late (87:20 - 87:24)
february it comes with stickers of (87:22 - 87:26)
characters of the beloved japanese (87:24 - 87:27)
animation and video game series which (87:26 - 87:30)
made its debut in south korea in 1999. (87:27 - 87:32)
with some stores quickly selling out (87:30 - 87:34)
queues have formed and even celebrities (87:32 - 87:36)
have been scrambling to buy the (87:34 - 87:38)
cake-like bread (87:36 - 87:39)
rm (87:38 - 87:41)
leader of the leader and member of the (87:39 - 87:45)
famed k-pop boy band bts also known as (87:41 - 87:48)
namjoon took social media to say that he (87:45 - 87:49)
is going to eight convenience stores to (87:48 - 87:52)
finally get a hold of some the bread was (87:49 - 87:54)
first released in 1998 and sold around (87:52 - 87:56)
early 2000s and returned to the market (87:54 - 87:58)
due to consumer demand according to its (87:56 - 88:00)
manufacturer (87:58 - 88:02)
um there's like a bunch more stuff about (88:00 - 88:04)
the the bread (88:02 - 88:06)
um (88:04 - 88:08)
so this (88:06 - 88:09)
so (88:08 - 88:11)
bread see like the pikachu one looks (88:09 - 88:14)
like it's bread the team rocket one in (88:11 - 88:16)
this picture is definitely a swiss cake (88:14 - 88:17)
roll yeah (88:16 - 88:20)
it's a stretch on the definition of (88:17 - 88:22)
bread i think it's a they're not a good (88:20 - 88:24)
translation i think they're like korean (88:22 - 88:28)
little debbie snacks yeah (88:24 - 88:28)
it makes me think in my the town that i (88:31 - 88:36)
came from in new york um there's two (88:34 - 88:40)
mega bakeries and each year they come (88:36 - 88:42)
out with something called easter bread (88:40 - 88:44)
and (88:42 - 88:45)
it it's (88:44 - 88:48)
bread that has sprinkles i i can't (88:45 - 88:51)
describe it but it's not really bread (88:48 - 88:53)
and it's not really cake but it's (88:51 - 88:54)
somewhere (88:53 - 88:56)
it isn't somewhere it's got it's like (88:54 - 88:57)
it's like a (88:56 - 88:58)
it's like a (88:57 - 89:00)
it's usually like a wreath and they have (88:58 - 89:02)
sprinkles and eggs (89:00 - 89:04)
like hard work (89:02 - 89:05)
yeah (89:04 - 89:08)
yeah so i mean and what's funny is like (89:05 - 89:09)
you can tell (89:08 - 89:10)
you can tell what kind of person (89:09 - 89:12)
somebody from my town is is like do you (89:10 - 89:14)
get your easter bread from nary's or do (89:12 - 89:17)
you get it from cassones (89:14 - 89:17)
but yes i do a recipe it's somewhere in (89:18 - 89:25)
between a cake and an actual it is like (89:21 - 89:29)
a danishy type morning (89:25 - 89:29)
it's like a sweet bread (89:31 - 89:36)
and it's got hard-boiled diet eggs in it (89:32 - 89:37)
um (89:36 - 89:39)
so for those unfamiliar with the uh (89:37 - 89:43)
k-pop scene uh k-pop fans are are very (89:39 - 89:45)
dedicated (89:43 - 89:46)
they uh (89:45 - 89:48)
they they live in their own world for (89:46 - 89:50)
better or for worse maybe for better not (89:48 - 89:52)
sure (89:50 - 89:55)
but um so namjoon the uh (89:52 - 89:57)
the (89:55 - 89:59)
leader i guess the (89:57 - 90:01)
the head honcho of bts (89:59 - 90:04)
um that feels weird (90:01 - 90:08)
what feels weird that call like calm (90:04 - 90:10)
like a leader of the singing group (90:08 - 90:14)
because that just feels weird yeah yeah (90:10 - 90:16)
i mean like he is he is theoretically (90:14 - 90:18)
the yeah he is the leader i mean also (90:16 - 90:20)
he's the one that knows how the most (90:18 - 90:22)
english so like any time in interviews (90:20 - 90:23)
like he he's the go-to (90:22 - 90:25)
um (90:23 - 90:26)
uh (90:25 - 90:29)
my my knowledge of of namjoon is that (90:26 - 90:31)
really the only out of all the (90:29 - 90:32)
interviews i've seen with him he's he's (90:31 - 90:34)
really only mentioned pokemon like maybe (90:32 - 90:36)
once or twice and it's usually somebody (90:34 - 90:37)
being like hey what's your favorite (90:36 - 90:39)
pokemon and um his favorite pokemon is (90:37 - 90:40)
dragonite (90:39 - 90:44)
um but he tweeted that he's like very (90:40 - 90:45)
excited these are back this makes more (90:44 - 90:47)
sense because i didn't read this article (90:45 - 90:48)
until this morning although i knew the (90:47 - 90:49)
bread thing was happening for a while (90:48 - 90:50)
because my wife was like oh you got to (90:49 - 90:52)
cover you got to cover the bts bird (90:50 - 90:53)
thing (90:52 - 90:55)
and i was like cool i'll cover the bts (90:53 - 90:57)
bird thing i didn't know that like the (90:55 - 90:59)
there's nostalgia to the bread itself of (90:57 - 91:01)
like oh they took it away so like now it (90:59 - 91:03)
makes more sense like this was a (91:01 - 91:05)
childhood favorite for a lot of people (91:03 - 91:06)
it's like the same thing when they took (91:05 - 91:08)
away surge for me and then they brought (91:06 - 91:10)
back surge and i was like oh i need to (91:08 - 91:12)
get the surge (91:10 - 91:16)
search was a good soda um (91:12 - 91:17)
but (91:16 - 91:19)
there are i think it says in the article (91:17 - 91:20)
i think we said this there's like (91:19 - 91:23)
stickers in these packs and so i know (91:20 - 91:24)
that (91:23 - 91:26)
namjoon is trying to collect (91:24 - 91:29)
all of the stickers so that's why he (91:26 - 91:32)
keeps buying them is now he's committed (91:29 - 91:33)
i haven't i don't even know what the (91:32 - 91:34)
stickers look like they don't show it in (91:33 - 91:36)
the picture they just show the (91:34 - 91:40)
the swiss rolls and like the whatever (91:36 - 91:42)
the cinnamon buns here (91:40 - 91:47)
uh but yeah there's there's um (91:42 - 91:47)
they said the (91:48 - 91:51)
the stickers itself can sell for 10 (91:49 - 91:54)
times the price of the bread (91:51 - 91:54)
and the the bread costs about a dollar (91:55 - 92:02)
20 um usd so i guess these stickers are (91:58 - 92:04)
going for like 10 bucks that makes sense (92:02 - 92:05)
yeah um (92:04 - 92:08)
that's probably like the the the mark (92:05 - 92:10)
the markup on (92:08 - 92:13)
this stuff so yeah so now and he's not (92:10 - 92:15)
the only one apparently this has been a (92:13 - 92:17)

uh you don't get to see the design (94:48 - 94:51)
okay (94:51 - 94:54)
that is immediately i'm out there's an (94:51 - 94:55)
asterisk there (94:54 - 94:58)
um they've done this before with like (94:55 - 95:00)
marvel (94:58 - 95:00)
hot wheels (95:00 - 95:02)
dungeons and dragons i've done this (95:00 - 95:03)
before (95:02 - 95:06)
the (95:03 - 95:06)
when i say asterix of you can't see the (95:06 - 95:11)
shirt design when the shirt prepares for (95:08 - 95:12)
shipping you know when it goes into your (95:11 - 95:14)
amazon orders and you can see the order (95:12 - 95:16)
number and you can see the ship date you (95:14 - 95:19)
can see the design there (95:16 - 95:21)
so at that point (95:19 - 95:23)
when it's about to ship you can see what (95:21 - 95:26)
the design is and you can cancel (95:23 - 95:27)
or skip (95:26 - 95:31)
and people know this because uh (95:27 - 95:33)
they've done shirt subscription services (95:31 - 95:36)
before so the first shirt (95:33 - 95:37)
uh (95:36 - 95:39)
it already starts off great (95:37 - 95:42)
it says t-shirt club johto region april (95:39 - 95:45)
t-shirt 1999. (95:42 - 95:47)
it shows a picture the picture of the (95:45 - 95:49)
shirt it's a purple shirt and it's just (95:47 - 95:52)
trico mudkip and torchic i want to (95:49 - 95:53)
remind you what the title of the shirt (95:52 - 95:58)
is johto region april shirt (95:53 - 95:58)
really starting off strong with the (96:01 - 96:06)
shirt club (96:03 - 96:06)
mudkip trico torchic johto region shirt (96:07 - 96:13)
um (96:11 - 96:13)
sure i guess it's cool it probably is (96:17 - 96:22)
really great for a parent to be like i'm (96:19 - 96:23)
getting little (96:22 - 96:27)
suzy uh pokemon shirt every month i (96:23 - 96:29)
feel like we are in it i feel like this (96:27 - 96:31)
is such a (96:29 - 96:34)
early to late 2000s gimmick (96:31 - 96:37)
that the fact that we are in the the age (96:34 - 96:40)
of 2022 and we're doing a blind box (96:37 - 96:42)
t-shirt (96:40 - 96:44)
but i mean they've got amazon has (96:42 - 96:46)
multiple (96:44 - 96:47)
of these (96:46 - 96:49)
subscription t-shirt subscription (96:47 - 96:51)
services and the thing is i'll tell you (96:49 - 96:54)
the secret it's a very low cost of entry (96:51 - 96:55)
for them (96:54 - 96:57)
and high profit (96:55 - 97:00)
yeah because guess what every month (96:57 - 97:02)
every t-shirt subscription that base (97:00 - 97:04)
shirt that the image is printed on (97:02 - 97:06)
everybody's getting the same base shirt (97:04 - 97:09)
yeah it's just a different image and the (97:06 - 97:12)
ink on the image is very low cost (97:09 - 97:15)
well yeah even like (97:12 - 97:17)
there's there's not a lot of money in in (97:15 - 97:19)
t-shirt making if you're only selling (97:17 - 97:22)
100 200 300 t-shirts like you're making (97:19 - 97:24)
you're maybe making like i don't know (97:22 - 97:26)
like five or six dollars a shirt (97:24 - 97:29)
um at that point (97:26 - 97:33)
but if you're amazon and you have what (97:29 - 97:35)
ten thousand fifty thousand people (97:33 - 97:37)
signing up for (97:35 - 97:39)
a pokemon shirt which is probably (97:37 - 97:42)
actually realistic for and for amazon (97:39 - 97:43)
yeah (97:42 - 97:45)
um (97:43 - 97:47)
and then pokemon gets a cut i'm sure (97:45 - 97:49)
licensing this was very easy the pokemon (97:47 - 97:51)
look if there's anything the pokemon (97:49 - 97:52)
company loves to do it's licensing out (97:51 - 97:55)
their product (97:52 - 97:55)
uh it's what it's whatever like like the (97:56 - 98:03)
like the design on this johto region (98:00 - 98:06)
t-shirt of torchic mudkip and trico is (98:03 - 98:07)
so generic (98:06 - 98:09)
it is i just if i'm gonna have a pokemon (98:07 - 98:12)
t-shirt i want it to be special and rare (98:09 - 98:13)
and not (98:12 - 98:15)
20 000 people got the same shirt so when (98:13 - 98:17)
i show up at go fest (98:15 - 98:20)
i'm not walking into a sea of jodo (98:17 - 98:22)
starters that aren't jodo starters (98:20 - 98:25)
that's like my katamari damasci t-shirt (98:22 - 98:27)
that nobody else in the world has want (98:25 - 98:30)
that so bad (98:27 - 98:32)
um (98:30 - 98:33)
all right question of the week real (98:32 - 98:35)
quick (98:33 - 98:35)
the question of the week (98:36 - 98:39)
ah this is from carlos what pokemon (98:41 - 98:45)
related april fool's jokes have you (98:43 - 98:47)
enjoyed in the past either from official (98:45 - 98:50)
pokemon media or fan sites there was (98:47 - 98:52)
this weird podcast that did this raichu (98:50 - 98:54)
thing a number of years ago don't (98:52 - 98:55)
remember who they were but that one was (98:54 - 98:57)
pretty good that one was pretty good (98:55 - 99:00)
that's actually i think still the best (98:57 - 99:03)
post on our website (99:00 - 99:05)
what what was it an alternate form what (99:03 - 99:09)
was it again it was it was uh so uh will (99:05 - 99:12)
brendel who is a fantastic artist he was (99:09 - 99:14)
on very very early episodes of ise his (99:12 - 99:17)
very distinct style it's very comic book (99:14 - 99:20)
style i used him in my game (99:17 - 99:23)
and uh it was this was around the time (99:20 - 99:26)
of omega ruby alpha sapphire a little (99:23 - 99:28)
bit after x and y but around omega ruby (99:26 - 99:29)
office sapphire um and i don't think (99:28 - 99:31)
omega ruby alpha sapphire was out yet (99:29 - 99:35)
actually no it wasn't um so i (99:31 - 99:39)
had him do ken sugimori artwork of (99:35 - 99:42)
raichu uh it was mega raichu oh that's (99:39 - 99:44)
right and yeah this was still when when (99:42 - 99:46)
like coracora was like (99:44 - 99:48)
coracore is a japanese magazine that (99:46 - 99:51)
would have early previews of of stuff (99:48 - 99:52)
it's really not used at all anymore it (99:51 - 99:54)
kind of fell off around this time as (99:52 - 99:56)
well but i like (99:54 - 99:58)
created a background in illustrator (99:56 - 99:59)
and then i printed it out and then i (99:58 - 100:01)
placed it in a magazine so it looked (99:59 - 100:02)
like uh (100:01 - 100:05)
well so just to explain to people uh (100:02 - 100:07)
so corocoro what would happen is like (100:05 - 100:10)
three or four days before the magazine (100:07 - 100:12)
was actually available to be bought (100:10 - 100:14)
people would find a copy because (100:12 - 100:15)
obviously a printed magazine has to be (100:14 - 100:17)
printed well in advance of it being (100:15 - 100:19)
available for sale and they'd be like oh (100:17 - 100:21)
we got the korokoro leaks and they do (100:19 - 100:26)
like bad photos of whatever pages (100:21 - 100:26)
um so yeah we did that and uh (100:27 - 100:31)
and i i mean like we we did the post i (100:31 - 100:35)
think i tweeted it and that was like it (100:34 - 100:37)
and i think somebody on twitter put it (100:35 - 100:39)
on reddit and then people argued whether (100:37 - 100:41)
it was real or not and then (100:39 - 100:43)
like the next day i updated the actual (100:41 - 100:45)
website and so just it just said like (100:43 - 100:47)
april fool's right like it was only live (100:45 - 100:50)
for oh i mean it's still live but (100:47 - 100:52)
instead april fool's on it that (100:50 - 100:54)
it turned out really well but that was a (100:52 - 100:56)
long look it was a long long long time (100:54 - 100:58)
ago it peaked (100:56 - 100:59)
peaked (100:58 - 101:01)
i will say that pokey jungle had a (100:59 - 101:04)
really good pokemon sleep april fool's (101:01 - 101:07)
thing oh yeah yeah they did um (101:04 - 101:10)
it was like (101:07 - 101:10)
like the the the the if the tweet wasn't (101:10 - 101:16)
on april 1st it would be like like when (101:13 - 101:17)
i saw the tweet i was like oh this must (101:16 - 101:19)
be the like april fool's day because (101:17 - 101:21)
like you tweeted it but like bulbapedia (101:19 - 101:23)
or sarah don't like no one else tweeted (101:21 - 101:25)
about pokemon sleep so it's like (101:23 - 101:26)
but like when i clicked it with the (101:25 - 101:28)
anticipation of like oh this probably (101:26 - 101:29)
isn't real and i was reading it like it (101:28 - 101:31)
made me laugh and i think that that's a (101:29 - 101:33)
good yeah (101:31 - 101:35)
like when it's obvious it's april fool's (101:33 - 101:38)
but it's like it's still funny it's (101:35 - 101:39)
still funny like i think that's like a (101:38 - 101:41)
really good like (101:39 - 101:43)
like he was like i think i think it said (101:41 - 101:45)
something about like (101:43 - 101:47)
needing 5g to like (101:45 - 101:50)
your like brain waves or something (101:47 - 101:51)
it was very tough it was very it was (101:50 - 101:53)
very it was an enjoyable read like (101:51 - 101:55)
i didn't feel like i felt like i didn't (101:53 - 101:57)
waste my time reading it i like laughed (101:55 - 101:58)
at the end it was good (101:57 - 102:02)
i enjoyed the um pokemon go 2022 event (101:58 - 102:03)
because i'm the only one who actually (102:02 - 102:05)
finished you did (102:03 - 102:07)
i almost complete i got two dittos on (102:05 - 102:10)
the ditto (102:07 - 102:10)
part of it where you have to catch the (102:10 - 102:14)
two of the transformers three catch (102:12 - 102:15)
three transformers and i only have two (102:14 - 102:17)
out of the three oh i'll be stuck there (102:15 - 102:18)
for the next three i'll be stuck there (102:17 - 102:21)
forever i'll be like will in 2025 i (102:18 - 102:23)
completed it (102:21 - 102:26)
when niantic changed all the sprites to (102:23 - 102:27)
pixels (102:26 - 102:28)
that was like three or four years ago (102:27 - 102:31)
that was incredible yeah (102:28 - 102:32)
um (102:31 - 102:34)
that was really really great that was (102:32 - 102:35)
probably one of the best things night (102:34 - 102:36)
tickets i've ever done is change the (102:35 - 102:37)
pixels (102:36 - 102:40)
my favorite because i have certification (102:37 - 102:41)
is the (102:40 - 102:43)
uh it was the april fool's google map (102:41 - 102:45)
search that's how i got my certification (102:43 - 102:48)
with google uh that was that was the (102:45 - 102:52)
lead-up of pokemon go yep (102:48 - 102:57)
and i did it and i'm a master now (102:52 - 102:57)
pokemon of the week (102:58 - 103:02)
all right last week's pokemon (103:00 - 103:05)
uh the easiest way to put it was which (103:02 - 103:07)
baby pokemon can potentially evolve into (103:05 - 103:09)
three (103:07 - 103:09)
pokemons shortest way yeah it is (103:09 - 103:10)
this different (103:09 - 103:10)
it's (103:12 - 103:15)
a hitmontop (103:15 - 103:20)
that's not a baby pokemon uh it's (103:17 - 103:21)
tyrogue (103:20 - 103:23)
which can evolve into hitmonlee (103:21 - 103:27)
hitmonchan or hitmontop the scuffle (103:23 - 103:30)
pokemon (103:27 - 103:30)
that's what it is i know it's just funny (103:30 - 103:36)
because it's like who says scuffle (103:34 - 103:37)
anymore (103:36 - 103:39)
um (103:37 - 103:41)
let's see here (103:39 - 103:43)
tyroik has several unique abilities that (103:41 - 103:45)
is the only pokemon whose evolutions is (103:43 - 103:47)
determined by its stats (103:45 - 103:49)
it is the only baby pokemon whose stats (103:47 - 103:50)
are all equal (103:49 - 103:52)
it is the only pokemon that created a (103:50 - 103:54)
shared evolution family between pokemon (103:52 - 103:58)
that were previously unrelated man they (103:54 - 104:00)
i want them to do this they could do it (103:58 - 104:02)
for mill tank but they won't for miltank (104:00 - 104:04)
and tauros and buffalo just make like a (104:02 - 104:05)
little calf (104:04 - 104:08)
it's fine it would be cool i mean (104:05 - 104:10)
spain's the one to do it in because (104:08 - 104:12)
true (104:10 - 104:13)
that's where they kill all the bulls (104:12 - 104:16)
that's where they kill all the balls (104:13 - 104:20)
if tyrogue is hacked into pokemon fire (104:16 - 104:22)
red and leaf green before the national (104:20 - 104:23)
dex is obtained (104:22 - 104:25)
it will be able to evolve into a (104:23 - 104:28)
hitmonly or hitmonchan but due to due to (104:25 - 104:30)
fire red and (104:28 - 104:32)
leaf green preventing evolution of (104:30 - 104:34)
non-generation one pokemon it will be (104:32 - 104:38)
unable to evolve into hitmontop (104:34 - 104:38)
before the national decks how (104:39 - 104:44)
gameplay are people that they do these (104:42 - 104:47)
things oh exactly exactly it's the same (104:44 - 104:49)
thing with the whole something changed (104:47 - 104:51)
with the youtube playlist (104:49 - 104:52)
it's us (104:51 - 104:54)
[Laughter] (104:52 - 104:57)
hitmontop shares the ability steadfast (104:54 - 104:59)
with tyrogue (104:57 - 105:01)
tyro cannot retain this ability after (104:59 - 105:03)
evolving because ty rogue steadfast is (105:01 - 105:05)
its second ability while hitmontop (105:03 - 105:08)
steadfast is hidden ability this is a (105:05 - 105:09)
shared trait with cubone and a low (105:08 - 105:13)
lomariwax ability of rockhead (105:09 - 105:15)
there's your trivia (105:13 - 105:17)
a good shuffle icon i also really like (105:15 - 105:19)
the shiny (105:17 - 105:21)
i didn't realize that ty rogues all its (105:19 - 105:24)
stats are 35 i didn't realize (105:21 - 105:25)
that they were all the same so then you (105:24 - 105:27)
have to manipulate it you have to miss (105:25 - 105:30)
what it's going to grow up into yeah (105:27 - 105:31)
just like real children (105:30 - 105:34)
but how does it work so if if tyrogue is (105:31 - 105:36)
like jolly (105:34 - 105:38)
does the nature affect the stats in the (105:36 - 105:42)
evolution process it is what the stats (105:38 - 105:45)
are when it evolves yeah so obviously (105:42 - 105:46)
nature will benefit you if you're (105:45 - 105:48)
looking for a particular evolution but (105:46 - 105:50)
you can't out counteract that based on (105:48 - 105:53)
whatever evs you give it (105:50 - 105:55)
but also when you catch it no it can't (105:53 - 105:57)
have evs when you catch it in legends it (105:55 - 106:00)
can have evie they can't catch it (105:57 - 106:02)
yeah because it's a baby (106:00 - 106:05)
so but the ivs would also affect it (106:02 - 106:08)
so even though all its stats are 31 if (106:05 - 106:11)
it had perfect attack when you caught it (106:08 - 106:12)
it would then be more likely to evolve (106:11 - 106:13)
into (106:12 - 106:15)
i think hitmonchan (106:13 - 106:17)
yes that's why getting a hit on top is (106:15 - 106:18)
so (106:17 - 106:20)
annoyingly difficult (106:18 - 106:24)
if you can't catch it in game (106:20 - 106:24)
because at that moment of evolution (106:25 - 106:32)
those evs have to all be exact (106:28 - 106:35)
all right you ready for this week yeah (106:32 - 106:36)
all right (106:35 - 106:39)
continuing on the topic of baby pokemon (106:36 - 106:40)
this week's entry provides a unique (106:39 - 106:42)
insight into pokemon growth and (106:40 - 106:44)
evolution (106:42 - 106:46)
one baby pokemon which originally could (106:44 - 106:49)
only be obtained through breeding that (106:46 - 106:52)
is when it was first introduced had a (106:49 - 106:54)
different gender ratio from the pokemon (106:52 - 106:57)
it evolves into (106:54 - 106:59)
gender ratios are the statistical (106:57 - 107:02)
likelihood that a particular pokemon (106:59 - 107:05)
will spawn as either male or female when (107:02 - 107:07)
they are generated in the wild or (107:05 - 107:09)
hatched from an egg (107:07 - 107:11)
because of the difference in gender (107:09 - 107:12)
ratios (107:11 - 107:15)
when this baby pokemon would evolve (107:12 - 107:18)
a third of the assigned female at birth (107:15 - 107:22)
babies would become male after evolution (107:18 - 107:24)
this particular potential was removed (107:22 - 107:27)
from the pokemon x and y games and the (107:24 - 107:30)
subsequent entries in the series (107:27 - 107:32)
so disappointing (107:30 - 107:33)
there you go (107:32 - 107:38)
hey uh greg and i will be at pax (107:33 - 107:41)
um i booked the right dates i hope i did (107:38 - 107:43)
hey my calendar says my flight and it (107:41 - 107:45)
lines up with the right dates (107:43 - 107:48)
our panel will be at 1pm on friday let's (107:45 - 107:50)
fight over the best pokemon i believe (107:48 - 107:53)
that will be broadcasted on pax's twitch (107:50 - 107:55)
channel (107:53 - 107:58)
and then uh i will be on a second panel (107:55 - 108:02)
with abdallah on saturday night i think (107:58 - 108:06)
that is at 6 30 and that will also be (108:02 - 108:07)
broadcasted but next week i'll probably (108:06 - 108:09)
have more details what am i supposed to (108:07 - 108:11)
do in that time (108:09 - 108:14)
watch the panel yeah i i don't know (108:11 - 108:16)
i just assume when i go to events with (108:14 - 108:18)
you at this point greg that you have so (108:16 - 108:20)
many friends and you know so many people (108:18 - 108:22)
that we will not see each other for the (108:20 - 108:24)
entire weekend (108:22 - 108:27)
you you are a social butterfly (108:24 - 108:31)
uh i am not it's called being popular (108:27 - 108:33)
and having a nice personality (108:31 - 108:35)
um (108:33 - 108:37)
uh but greg and i will be doing (108:35 - 108:39)
community on on (108:37 - 108:42)
on saturday we'll be doing the old (108:39 - 108:44)
stuffel (108:42 - 108:46)
and we will probably have like if you (108:44 - 108:49)
want to do community with us and granted (108:46 - 108:52)
we are we are assuming the there will be (108:49 - 108:56)
no rain or no snow or no hurricanes (108:52 - 108:58)
um i don't know what the average (108:56 - 108:59)
temperature in boston is at the end of (108:58 - 109:01)
april i'm gonna hope like maybe 50 or 60 (108:59 - 109:03)
degrees (109:01 - 109:04)
uh assuming everything is nice we'll (109:03 - 109:06)
have like a meet-up spot like let's meet (109:04 - 109:08)
at the gazebo let's meet at this corner (109:06 - 109:10)
let's meet at this tree let's meet at (109:08 - 109:12)
the statue there's a lot of statues in (109:10 - 109:14)
the park i think there's a (109:12 - 109:16)
george washington or thomas jefferson or (109:14 - 109:18)
something (109:16 - 109:20)
um we'll have a meet-up spot so we'll (109:18 - 109:21)
all start (109:20 - 109:22)
we'll say like hey let's meet up here at (109:21 - 109:24)
two and then we'll pick a directional (109:22 - 109:25)
walk and (109:24 - 109:27)
if you want to join us cool if not no (109:25 - 109:28)
big deal you don't need a pax ticket (109:27 - 109:30)
obviously for that you just have to be (109:28 - 109:31)
in the boston area (109:30 - 109:33)
um (109:31 - 109:36)
and shouldn't be in the lower 50s to (109:33 - 109:38)
upper 60s judging by where the (109:36 - 109:39)
temperatures are now (109:38 - 109:42)
lower 50s upper 60s that's a that's good (109:39 - 109:43)
hoodie weather (109:42 - 109:45)
because right now like next friday in (109:43 - 109:48)
boston it'll be 61 (109:45 - 109:51)
uh but then sunday it'll be 54. so (109:48 - 109:53)
we got a range to work with it should be (109:51 - 109:55)
getting warmer knowing our luck it'll (109:53 - 109:59)
rain absolutely and we'll go to a mall (109:55 - 110:01)
um so that's the plan (109:59 - 110:03)
uh (110:01 - 110:03)
should should be available should be (110:04 - 110:07)
