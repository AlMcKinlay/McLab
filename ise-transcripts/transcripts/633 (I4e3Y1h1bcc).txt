that&#39;s cool I&#39;m very into this that&#39;s (1:35 - 1:41)
fine uh okay so our show for you guys (1:39 - 1:43)
today is we have some Pokemon sleep news (1:41 - 1:45)
Pokemon Masters 5year anniversary uh (1:43 - 1:48)
there&#39;s a bunch of information on the (1:45 - 1:51)
new Pokemon go update and then there is (1:48 - 1:53)
some TCG information which actually ties (1:51 - 1:57)
into Legends Za so I know people love (1:53 - 2:01)
when we talk about main Series games uh (1:57 - 2:03)
and there there is some if we if we look (2:01 - 2:06)
at how the trademarks work for TCG stuff (2:03 - 2:10)
so we can go down that route but um I (2:06 - 2:11)
guess before we get into the Pokemon (2:10 - 2:14)
sleep news I do want to point out that (2:11 - 2:16)
this was not on the show notes I&#39;m sorry (2:14 - 2:18)
Bobby and Bob uh that we didn&#39;t really (2:16 - 2:22)
talk about huian slugo being in the (2:18 - 2:23)
Timeless (2:22 - 2:26)
Woods which is not the (2:23 - 2:31)
first I think huian Pokemon we&#39;ve gotten (2:26 - 2:33)
am I wrong on that I feel like we&#39;ve (2:31 - 2:36)
gotten well we&#39;ve gotten Regional (2:33 - 2:39)
forms of like Raichu and (2:36 - 2:43)
stuff is is this maybe the first one was (2:39 - 2:45)
there like hisan quish is already in the (2:43 - 2:48)
blueberry Academy okay that&#39;s I was to (2:45 - 2:51)
that one too quish and then huian (2:48 - 2:54)
basalin is in the Timeless Forest (2:51 - 2:57)
already I would assume throughout the (2:54 - 2:59)
rest of this life cycle of scarlet and (2:57 - 3:01)
violet I&#39;m I&#39;m literally talking about (2:59 - 3:02)
Scarlet Violet to feed these people&#39;s (3:01 - 3:05)
needs of needing to know about main (3:02 - 3:08)
Series games anyways I I&#39;m assuming that (3:05 - 3:12)
we will see huin sneez and sneezer and (3:08 - 3:15)
um I can&#39;t even I&#39;m blanking uh Weir (3:12 - 3:20)
deer and bravery and Meowth yeah like (3:15 - 3:21)
well not Meowth well (3:20 - 3:24)
meow I I do see them doing a Meowth (3:21 - 3:28)
where like Kanto Meowth is on (3:24 - 3:32)
Pala the Alan alolan Meowth is in (3:28 - 3:35)
blueberry (3:32 - 3:38)
right Meowth and kakami I do see that (3:35 - 3:41)
anyways the point I&#39;m making is I think (3:38 - 3:44)
that all the Hui Pokemon are coming to (3:41 - 3:47)
scarlet and violet through outbreaks one (3:44 - 3:49)
way or (3:47 - 3:52)
another as as well as like the rest of (3:49 - 3:54)
the starters and whatever other Pokemon (3:52 - 3:55)
they would want to put in seven star (3:54 - 3:58)
raids (3:55 - 3:58)
yep so (3:58 - 4:03)
there&#39;s like lore behind Timeless Woods (4:00 - 4:06)
of why basalin is there and why slugo (4:03 - 4:09)
appeared so they can make any exception (4:06 - 4:13)
for the Timeless woods part of kakami (4:09 - 4:15)
they can make something up and I&#39;ll be (4:13 - 4:17)
like yes I agree with this decision so (4:15 - 4:17)
this will (4:17 - 4:22)
[Laughter] (4:17 - 4:24)
work and because we&#39;re recording the on (4:22 - 4:26)
of Sunday probably by the time this goes (4:24 - 4:27)
up they&#39;ll announce whatever the next (4:26 - 4:32)
sevenstar raid is going to be um so oh (4:27 - 4:34)
right they&#39;re done with the (4:32 - 4:36)
summer like they&#39;re done with all the (4:34 - 4:39)
announcements they had made right yeah (4:36 - 4:40)
didn&#39;t they do they did those all at (4:39 - 4:43)
once right so like this last outbreak (4:40 - 4:45)
and uh raid that we&#39; known about that (4:43 - 4:48)
for a while right this they gave us two (4:45 - 4:50)
months of content that&#39;s now it&#39;s done (4:48 - 4:51)
though right so now we don&#39;t know (4:50 - 4:54)
anything of what&#39;s coming next okay cool (4:51 - 4:56)
I I hope they do like here&#39;s another two (4:54 - 4:58)
months I I like that they kind of like (4:56 - 5:00)
plan that out yeah (4:58 - 5:03)
um and even with like the Dragonite and (5:00 - 5:05)
the dondoo it wasn&#39;t like Friday (5:03 - 5:08)
Saturday Sunday it was just here it is (5:05 - 5:10)
for two weeks and I like that yeah (5:08 - 5:13)
that&#39;s I enjoyed being able to go (5:10 - 5:16)
through because there were so many so I (5:13 - 5:18)
mean for me who has like tries to (5:16 - 5:20)
collect for like a living decks right (5:18 - 5:22)
for especially for like shinies there (5:20 - 5:24)
was a lot of different outbreaks to go (5:22 - 5:26)
through uh I didn&#39;t even actually get (5:24 - 5:28)
like one of each of everything but like (5:26 - 5:30)
it was nice to have more than just like (5:28 - 5:33)
three days to try to catch Larvitar and (5:30 - 5:37)
beon and Beldum and SLU and Gom you know (5:33 - 5:40)
like there&#39;s a lot to do in like three (5:37 - 5:42)
days so it was nice that it was uh like (5:40 - 5:45)
a week or 10 days whatever it was I (5:42 - 5:47)
think yeah the the this recent outbreak (5:45 - 5:48)
was 10 days yeah (5:47 - 5:52)
yeah and if you forgot to do your slugo (5:48 - 5:54)
or your Beldum uh just don&#39;t connect to (5:52 - 5:55)
the internet when you&#39;re listening to (5:54 - 5:58)
this podcast and they will stay until (5:55 - 6:00)
you do connect to the internet assuming (5:58 - 6:01)
you&#39;ve connected to the internet at (6:00 - 6:03)
least once in the last 10 (6:01 - 6:06)
days so I know what I&#39;m not doing today (6:03 - 6:08)
I&#39;m because I have to get mine still so (6:06 - 6:10)
I need to uh do that not connect to the (6:08 - 6:12)
internet not I will not connect to the (6:10 - 6:14)
internet same same because I forgot you (6:12 - 6:16)
could do that so yeah great I can still (6:14 - 6:19)
high still have a chance yes yes yeah I (6:16 - 6:21)
did not get a chance to do anything (6:19 - 6:22)
besides (6:21 - 6:25)
SLU and I (6:22 - 6:27)
don&#39;t I think I want to try for like a (6:25 - 6:32)
Larvitar or a yeah the other one beon (6:27 - 6:35)
beon beon yeah yeah I mean so I will say (6:32 - 6:37)
I got SLU CU that was the first one I (6:35 - 6:40)
was after with the two Hui and SLU but (6:37 - 6:44)
Beldum is so hard to catch so you know I (6:40 - 6:46)
had to I think I I ran up on a Beldum (6:44 - 6:49)
and then realized I had like 37 luxury (6:46 - 6:50)
balls I was like obviously I have to (6:49 - 6:51)
catch it in a luxury ball because I (6:50 - 6:53)
always catch my shinies in luxury balls (6:51 - 6:55)
I ran out of the 37 luckily I had saved (6:53 - 6:57)
it so I just reset the game I had to (6:55 - 6:58)
reset the game like three times before I (6:57 - 7:01)
find before I finally got the Beldum so (6:58 - 7:04)
that&#39;s a tough yeah we could spend the (7:01 - 7:07)
next hour talking about how catching (7:04 - 7:07)
is I would love to have that (7:08 - 7:12)
conversation again Beldum for whatever (7:10 - 7:13)
reason has the same catch rate as like (7:12 - 7:15)
Mewtwo and other legendaries right it&#39;s (7:13 - 7:18)
so weird I just master ball it I&#39;m not (7:15 - 7:19)
wasting my time I&#39;m a busy (7:18 - 7:22)
man put a Bellum in a master ball call (7:19 - 7:24)
it a day go make dinner I&#39;m all I&#39;m all (7:22 - 7:27)
good I mean shiny Shiny Metagross in a (7:24 - 7:28)
master ball does look pretty good it (7:27 - 7:32)
does yeah yeah yeah yeah so all right (7:28 - 7:34)
let&#39;s get to the the the meat and (7:32 - 7:38)
potatoes of this podcast Pokemon (7:34 - 7:38)
sleep the thing that everyone wants to (7:38 - 7:43)
hear about there was a (7:40 - 7:43)
1.11.0 update uh it does change a couple (7:43 - 7:50)
things here and I just we say this every (7:47 - 7:52)
week the communication from select (7:50 - 7:55)
button on this game is Just (7:52 - 8:00)
fantastic uh the updates here are (7:55 - 8:02)
they added a function that continuously (8:00 - 8:04)
increases the number of candies when you (8:02 - 8:07)
hold the increase buttton to level up so (8:04 - 8:10)
that is very nice um they were also (8:07 - 8:12)
going to this is why I think their (8:10 - 8:14)
communication is fantastic they were (8:12 - 8:16)
originally going to add a back button (8:14 - 8:18)
where if you hold it down it will take (8:16 - 8:20)
you back to the home screen and they (8:18 - 8:21)
actually said like we couldn&#39;t get this (8:20 - 8:24)
to work so heads up we were trying to (8:21 - 8:27)
make this happen it didn&#39;t work but we (8:24 - 8:31)
will fix it in a future update uh which (8:27 - 8:34)
Niantic could never Niantic would blame (8:31 - 8:35)
us that something went (8:34 - 8:39)
[Laughter] (8:35 - 8:42)
wrong uh they uh made adjustment so it&#39;s (8:39 - 8:44)
possible to use dream clusters from the (8:42 - 8:48)
use item button uh they also adjusted (8:44 - 8:49)
that allowed changes to graphic quality (8:48 - 8:51)
and FPS from the menu on the title (8:49 - 8:54)
screen they adjusted a display of (8:51 - 8:58)
friends login times which Pokemon go has (8:54 - 9:00)
not done this in eight years and I wish (8:58 - 9:02)
they would so now in in Pokemon sleep it (9:00 - 9:05)
would be like one (9:02 - 9:07)
day what what was it it was like one day (9:05 - 9:09)
3 days seven days I think something like (9:07 - 9:11)
that yeah it was and now they&#39;re saying (9:09 - 9:13)
now you can see if a friend has logged (9:11 - 9:16)
in 1 two three four five or seven plus (9:13 - 9:18)
days on the research (9:16 - 9:21)
page and your friends list in Pokemon (9:18 - 9:22)
sleep very important because that is (9:21 - 9:27)
literally free candy every single day um (9:22 - 9:29)
and I hate deleting people I don&#39;t know (9:27 - 9:30)
if you guys have had to delete people (9:29 - 9:32)
yet but like if you didn&#39;t play during (9:30 - 9:34)
the oneye anniversary and you were seven (9:32 - 9:37)
plus days I&#39;m I&#39;m (9:34 - 9:41)
sorry you&#39;re you like ski the best event (9:37 - 9:44)
yeah yeah yep I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve been (9:41 - 9:46)
there a couple of times because you&#39;re (9:44 - 9:48)
you&#39;re right Steve that list is is just (9:46 - 9:50)
free candy that you just log in once a (9:48 - 9:51)
couple times a day because people have (9:50 - 9:54)
different you know different time zones (9:51 - 9:56)
they wake up they catalog their sleep (9:54 - 9:59)
you get free candy and I kind of want to (9:56 - 10:01)
be around people who enjoy the game as (9:59 - 10:04)
much as I do so if I don&#39;t see you doing (10:01 - 10:06)
the stuff I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know I might (10:04 - 10:09)
have to voke you off I like (10:06 - 10:12)
this well Bob are you still wailing this (10:09 - 10:14)
game pretty hard you were you were a (10:12 - 10:17)
good camper ticket every single week I (10:14 - 10:18)
do I do I (10:17 - 10:22)
I actually hold on whoa I take that back (10:18 - 10:25)
I would say 90% of the time I do a good (10:22 - 10:27)
camp ticket every single week there are (10:25 - 10:30)
some weeks like if I&#39;m like on (10:27 - 10:32)
um the first two islands I don&#39;t do it (10:30 - 10:34)
because I have maxed out percentages and (10:32 - 10:36)
I can get to Masters pretty quickly (10:34 - 10:38)
maybe on lapis I&#39;ll do a good camp (10:36 - 10:40)
ticket but the last couple weeks I (10:38 - 10:41)
haven&#39;t done it because I&#39;m saving it (10:40 - 10:45)
for suun uh when it comes out um but I (10:41 - 10:47)
still think that&#39;s the best item that if (10:45 - 10:50)
you can and sometimes Pokemon sleep will (10:47 - 10:52)
have like a very special bundle like (10:50 - 10:54)
once in a while it&#39;ll be like like $299 (10:52 - 10:56)
I think you get some gems you get a good (10:54 - 10:58)
camp ticket cu the good camp ticket is (10:56 - 11:00)
about $5 to to start off (10:58 - 11:02)
so if you&#39;re ever in that position where (11:00 - 11:05)
you want to maybe dip your toe into the (11:02 - 11:07)
um play to win Arena and you see that (11:05 - 11:09)
promotion definitely go for it but I (11:07 - 11:11)
still think the best item in the game is (11:09 - 11:13)
that is that good cam because you get (11:11 - 11:16)
boosted uh pots your workers will be uh (11:13 - 11:18)
getting more ingredients and berries (11:16 - 11:20)
quicker you&#39;ll get a guaranteed hungry (11:18 - 11:22)
Pokemon on your campsite that&#39;s not (11:20 - 11:25)
shiny so it it it really does have a lot (11:22 - 11:28)
but yes I do 10 nine out of 10 times do (11:25 - 11:31)
buy a good camp ticket every wow keeping (11:28 - 11:32)
keeping this game in business yeah (11:31 - 11:34)
select button I&#39;m on that payroll (11:32 - 11:38)
believe it or not for that no I like it (11:34 - 11:40)
um I so I used a good camp ticket this (11:38 - 11:42)
week because I thought okay first time (11:40 - 11:45)
going to Snowdrop let me just like go in (11:42 - 11:47)
and start off like you know doing a (11:45 - 11:50)
little bit better with a a a ticket and (11:47 - 11:52)
then like halfway through the week I (11:50 - 11:54)
decided to change my strategy to like oh (11:52 - 11:56)
I should be collecting stuff in (11:54 - 11:58)
preparation for suun and not (11:56 - 12:01)
using bun of stuff for meals and I kind (11:58 - 12:03)
of felt like oh maybe I shouldn&#39;t have (12:01 - 12:04)
done this I mean it still worked out it (12:03 - 12:07)
was still okay like but it was just like (12:04 - 12:09)
I should probably like just like figure (12:07 - 12:11)
out my strategy at the beginning of the (12:09 - 12:13)
week and not three days into the week (12:11 - 12:16)
for what I&#39;m doing but uh you know I I (12:13 - 12:18)
feel like every time I use a good camp (12:16 - 12:21)
ticket the week after I&#39;m so tempted to (12:18 - 12:24)
just use it because I&#39;m like oh back to (12:21 - 12:27)
regular like I don&#39;t want to do that (12:24 - 12:30)
like my strategy was I did want to use a (12:27 - 12:32)
good Campa ticket this week because I (12:30 - 12:36)
was on lapis and I&#39;m I&#39;m Max on lapis (12:32 - 12:38)
but I I was like I want to push lapis a (12:36 - 12:40)
little bit harder because without a good (12:38 - 12:41)
camp ticket I can only get to like (12:40 - 12:45)
master rank five on lapis and obviously (12:41 - 12:48)
like master rank seven eight nine is (12:45 - 12:50)
that&#39;s when you&#39;re like getting the good (12:48 - 12:52)
stuff uh and I&#39;m still looking for routs (12:50 - 12:54)
like I&#39;m still looking for a good Ralts (12:52 - 12:58)
I don&#39;t have one um so I did good camp (12:54 - 13:01)
ticket halfway through the week (12:58 - 13:04)
so then when suun starts I&#39;ll have three (13:01 - 13:06)
days of good camp tickets so I can push (13:04 - 13:08)
suun really hard those first three days (13:06 - 13:11)
huh on Green Grass and I know that I can (13:08 - 13:13)
get to Green Grass 10 without a good (13:11 - 13:15)
camp ticket so then the rest of the week (13:13 - 13:17)
I won&#39;t need the good camp ticket and (13:15 - 13:18)
then I can save an actual good camp (13:17 - 13:22)
ticket for the second week so I kind of (13:18 - 13:24)
like dipped my toes into that&#39;s pretty (13:22 - 13:26)
good interesting interesting strategy (13:24 - 13:28)
there I like I like if you didn&#39;t know (13:26 - 13:30)
you can pop the a good camp ticket at (13:28 - 13:32)
any time and it just gives you seven (13:30 - 13:34)
days so you don&#39;t have to do it on (13:32 - 13:36)
Monday yeah (13:34 - 13:39)
H okay I didn&#39;t even think about that (13:36 - 13:40)
that&#39;s (13:39 - 13:41)
[Laughter] (13:40 - 13:47)
yeah I do that they also added (13:41 - 13:50)
uh they added a thing in Pokemon sleep (13:47 - 13:53)
where you can now see what device people (13:50 - 13:55)
are using to sleep with (13:53 - 13:57)
yeah and I don&#39;t think it like it (13:55 - 13:59)
doesn&#39;t like change the game or like oh (13:57 - 14:01)
my gosh I got to log in but it is like a (13:59 - 14:03)
cool thing to be like oh this person has (14:01 - 14:05)
like the Plus+ next to their name or (14:03 - 14:06)
this person has a phone next to their (14:05 - 14:09)
name um I don&#39;t know if it I think they (14:06 - 14:11)
were talking about in the slack Bobby I (14:09 - 14:13)
could be wrong but is there a difference (14:11 - 14:15)
between tablet and phone I thought I saw (14:13 - 14:17)
Hannah mention something about this I (14:15 - 14:19)
don&#39;t oh I don&#39;t know actually I didn&#39;t (14:17 - 14:22)
I didn&#39;t notice um because like how (14:19 - 14:25)
would that work for like the icon would (14:22 - 14:28)
just be biggering phone is folding phone (14:25 - 14:31)
just phone I wanted it to be so Advanced (14:28 - 14:33)
that I can see if it&#39;s an iPhone or a (14:31 - 14:36)
Samsung or a flip phone oh I don&#39;t yeah (14:33 - 14:37)
I don&#39;t think it goes that deep I think (14:36 - 14:41)
it&#39;s just a device yeah but that&#39;d be (14:37 - 14:43)
pretty cool to see okay who are these (14:41 - 14:44)
green bubbles and blue bubbles here my (14:43 - 14:49)
Pokemon sleep give me that in Pokemon (14:44 - 14:51)
sleep but I will say because I just um I (14:49 - 14:53)
actually saw it behind next to your name (14:51 - 14:55)
Steve uh in the in the list I&#39;m like (14:53 - 14:57)
what is this so I looked it up and I (14:55 - 15:00)
just noticed that um it is I think uh (14:57 - 15:02)
defaulted toggle off so you have to (15:00 - 15:03)
actually enable if you want to share (15:02 - 15:05)
that information which yes I don&#39;t think (15:03 - 15:09)
it&#39;s a harmful thing at this point but I (15:05 - 15:10)
think it&#39;s more I mean people are (15:09 - 15:11)
already seeing my sleep data I don&#39;t (15:10 - 15:15)
know if the device is going to like yeah (15:11 - 15:18)
yeah so yeah I mean unless you&#39;re (15:15 - 15:21)
telling people you&#39;re using a go Plus+ (15:18 - 15:23)
and then all of a sudden they see a (15:21 - 15:25)
mobile device pop up and then they know (15:23 - 15:28)
you&#39;re lying so make sure you&#39;re being (15:25 - 15:30)
truthful if you have it turned on and (15:28 - 15:31)
people so people know what you&#39;re (15:30 - 15:33)
actually using here&#39;s the thing if you (15:31 - 15:35)
ever seen my name with a mobile device (15:33 - 15:36)
I&#39;m probably traveling cuz I forgot my (15:35 - 15:40)
go Plus+ oh there that&#39;s that&#39;s a little (15:36 - 15:43)
inside valuable information you see if (15:40 - 15:45)
you see me with a phone icon I forgot my (15:43 - 15:48)
go (15:45 - 15:48)
Plus+ um the other thing uh we we have a (15:48 - 15:54)
little extra time today there was a th (15:51 - 15:56)
this is like not like super breaking (15:54 - 15:57)
news I think it is interesting how (15:56 - 15:59)
there&#39;s so many different play styles in (15:57 - 16:02)
Pokemon sleep um we&#39;ve talked about on (15:59 - 16:06)
this show how the meta for Pokemon sleep (16:02 - 16:07)
is (16:06 - 16:09)
like I wouldn&#39;t say like gold duck is (16:07 - 16:11)
the best Pokemon but you&#39;ll see a lot of (16:09 - 16:13)
hardcore players talk about gold duck (16:11 - 16:15)
Bob are you a gold duck user oh of (16:13 - 16:20)
course not no no I I would say blasphemy (16:15 - 16:22)
how dare you consider me to be a Golduck (16:20 - 16:26)
user I I will say probably in the first (16:22 - 16:28)
couple of months I had a decent Golduck (16:26 - 16:32)
on my team but then I just you know got (16:28 - 16:35)
rid of it I just didn&#39;t find any value (16:32 - 16:37)
uh behind behind the gold duck to be (16:35 - 16:39)
honest with you um and then you (16:37 - 16:41)
transferred it you actually got rid of (16:39 - 16:42)
it or you just (16:41 - 16:45)
okay so upset with the gold duck meta (16:42 - 16:47)
that they just transferred (16:45 - 16:50)
it yeah know I um yeah I don&#39;t really (16:47 - 16:53)
use Golduck as much um when I when I had (16:50 - 16:55)
it I think I just had other Pokemon take (16:53 - 16:59)
over its uh its slot for the ability but (16:55 - 17:02)
other than that I just I have a I have a (16:59 - 17:04)
decent number of ingredient gatherers I (17:02 - 17:07)
have a really good Wiggly tff that does (17:04 - 17:09)
the uh energy for everyone so I don&#39;t (17:07 - 17:10)
really need a Walt I just I just use (17:09 - 17:13)
that and then I have a decent den and a (17:10 - 17:17)
karant that does the uh lucky um extra (17:13 - 17:19)
tasty chances yeah and that&#39;s and other (17:17 - 17:21)
than that I save maybe one or two slots (17:19 - 17:23)
for that Island&#39;s Berry specialist and (17:21 - 17:25)
just put it in there so and you&#39;re (17:23 - 17:26)
you&#39;re an expert spending good camp (17:25 - 17:28)
ticket every single week oh yeah oh yeah (17:26 - 17:30)
when I see if I if I see a Pokemon that (17:28 - 17:33)
I don&#39;t like uh I get my candy back for (17:30 - 17:34)
it I&#39;m like please don&#39;t waste my spot (17:33 - 17:37)
in my in my list I am a and I don&#39;t and (17:34 - 17:39)
I don&#39;t use grading systems like I I (17:37 - 17:41)
just I can look at the Pokemon and say (17:39 - 17:43)
yes this is good or no this is subpar (17:41 - 17:45)
and like just move on and yeah yeah I (17:43 - 17:46)
think when you play long enough you can (17:45 - 17:48)
kind of I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re there yet (17:46 - 17:49)
Bobby where if when you&#39;re looking at it (17:48 - 17:51)
you kind of know yeah no for the most (17:49 - 17:54)
part like I was using the grading I was (17:51 - 17:55)
trying the different like the two (17:54 - 17:57)
different sites for like grading at one (17:55 - 17:59)
point in time and then I was was kind of (17:57 - 18:02)
just like I&#39;m kind of tired of this I (17:59 - 18:05)
will use the one the candy calculator to (18:02 - 18:07)
to just to see like okay how much do I (18:05 - 18:09)
need to spend to get to like level 30 or (18:07 - 18:12)
whatever candy calculator website yeah (18:09 - 18:13)
so you can just put in what level you&#39;re (18:12 - 18:15)
at what level you&#39;re going to if you (18:13 - 18:18)
have exp down or up and then oh it&#39;ll (18:15 - 18:19)
just tell you like this is how much (18:18 - 18:21)
candy it would take to get to like (18:19 - 18:23)
whatever level you&#39;re looking to get to (18:21 - 18:25)
got it not me doing like two rare (18:23 - 18:27)
candies and then another two rare (18:25 - 18:28)
candies and then another two rare (18:27 - 18:30)
candies cuz you don&#39;t want like overdo (18:28 - 18:32)
it you&#39;re just trying to get to like 30 (18:30 - 18:34)
yeah exactly so I will do that but I (18:32 - 18:36)
don&#39;t use the grading systems anymore (18:34 - 18:39)
but I will sometimes like send like (18:36 - 18:41)
Steve I&#39;ll send you a Pokemon or I&#39;ll (18:39 - 18:42)
send it in slack and be like should I (18:41 - 18:44)
invest in this like you know I think I (18:42 - 18:46)
think this is good but like maybe I&#39;m (18:44 - 18:48)
like not seeing something that someone (18:46 - 18:50)
else sees so you I&#39;ll do that from time (18:48 - 18:51)
to (18:50 - 18:53)
time (18:51 - 18:56)
um so there was a there was like a (18:53 - 18:59)
survey in Japan of like Japan&#39;s favorite (18:56 - 19:01)
Pokémon and we&#39;re not going to go (18:59 - 19:03)
through the whole list but the what (19:01 - 19:06)
Japan considers s tier Pokemon are (19:03 - 19:12)
Den gavor Dragonite Blastoise Victory (19:06 - 19:14)
Bell and skele (19:12 - 19:20)
durge um and I have a very mediocre Den (19:14 - 19:22)
that&#39;s why I&#39;m on lapis I&#39;m like looking (19:20 - 19:25)
for a better one and good thing I&#39;ve (19:22 - 19:28)
seen one in three weeks uh but I&#39;ve (19:25 - 19:32)
always like to me Den is s tier like I (19:28 - 19:35)
even my mediocre one I feel like is is (19:32 - 19:38)
is still super good I have a Dragonite I (19:35 - 19:40)
have a Blastoise I have a victory bell I (19:38 - 19:41)
do I agree I think all of those are s (19:40 - 19:43)
tier like they they just bring so much (19:41 - 19:46)
ingredients so quickly okay never used (19:43 - 19:48)
never use a skele durge so I can&#39;t speak (19:46 - 19:50)
to that um quick question about Den (19:48 - 19:54)
because I don&#39;t have one um what makes (19:50 - 19:56)
it because I know nothing about it other (19:54 - 19:59)
than it&#39;s got the extra tasty is the um (19:56 - 20:02)
main skill for it yeah uh what makes it (19:59 - 20:05)
so much better than crar an like is it (20:02 - 20:06)
just the is it just the ingredients and (20:05 - 20:10)
how quick it is it&#39;s not it&#39;s the (20:06 - 20:12)
opposite wait what Bob you want to (20:10 - 20:15)
explain well I was going to say it&#39;s (20:12 - 20:17)
because I mean crar is is really an (20:15 - 20:20)
ingredient Pokemon at heart yes and then (20:17 - 20:23)
Den is a skill-based Pokemon and that&#39;s (20:20 - 20:26)
why so the was the first one to come out (20:23 - 20:30)
with that extra tasty um power up so (20:26 - 20:33)
yeah that&#39;s why I think and I agree with (20:30 - 20:35)
the list the is such a saw after Pokemon (20:33 - 20:38)
because you invest a good skill the den (20:35 - 20:40)
to get that extra tasty I mean I so I (20:38 - 20:43)
have a crar that has some ingredient (20:40 - 20:46)
powerups and it has one skill trigger um (20:43 - 20:49)
ability so I can kind of get the best of (20:46 - 20:50)
both worlds there but I really think (20:49 - 20:52)
crant is more of that ingredient (20:50 - 20:55)
gathered than what what I the den is (20:52 - 20:57)
okay that I didn&#39;t think about the whole (20:55 - 20:59)
skills versus ingredients versus berries (20:57 - 21:01)
yeah Den skill so because it&#39;s skill it (20:59 - 21:04)
can Bank uh a power up yeah that&#39;s right (21:01 - 21:06)
so like almost every morning with Den um (21:04 - 21:09)
I&#39;m getting times I&#39;m getting 8% not 4% (21:06 - 21:12)
because it&#39;s proing twice (21:09 - 21:17)
nice like I my crar has main skill up (21:12 - 21:21)
um and but because crar a skill Manon I (21:17 - 21:23)
maybe get it to proc once a day where (21:21 - 21:25)
like Den I&#39;m getting four to six procs a (21:23 - 21:28)
day and again my Den is not main skill (21:25 - 21:29)
up it&#39;s not skill (21:28 - 21:31)
it&#39;s literally like inventory inventory (21:29 - 21:33)
because it&#39;s like the only one I (21:31 - 21:35)
have (21:33 - 21:40)
so and I um I think the and the reason (21:35 - 21:42)
gavor is here is just because gavor is a (21:40 - 21:44)
better Wiggly tff it&#39;s just like there&#39;s (21:42 - 21:45)
power creep there so like not that (21:44 - 21:47)
Wigglytuff is like bad but like once you (21:45 - 21:50)
get a gardav war there&#39;s almost no (21:47 - 21:51)
reason to run Wigglytuff unless the (21:50 - 21:54)
berry itself matches on the island but (21:51 - 21:56)
like yeah I run Wiggly tough every week (21:54 - 21:58)
regardless of Barry just because of how (21:56 - 22:01)
powerful she is yeah same same so okay I (21:58 - 22:02)
was just looking at my crar real quick (22:01 - 22:04)
cuz I was like why do I feel like my (22:02 - 22:06)
crar an does proc a lot it&#39;s because (22:04 - 22:09)
it&#39;s got ingredient finding up and I (22:06 - 22:12)
also have skill trigger M oh yeah that (22:09 - 22:15)
what is helping there so I think my crar (22:12 - 22:17)
eventually gets a skill trigger at like (22:15 - 22:20)
50 MH but I was like do I invest to 50 (22:17 - 22:22)
or do I just wait for a better crar at (22:20 - 22:24)
that point well you have like 50 crar (22:22 - 22:28)
ants so I I I I did throw a lot of them (22:24 - 22:30)
away because I was I was trying to get (22:28 - 22:35)
the right one um now the the the if you (22:30 - 22:36)
want a tier Pokemon they&#39;re saying wall (22:35 - 22:40)
R Raichu Meganium tyan for alligator (22:36 - 22:42)
none of these are surprising Steelix (22:40 - 22:44)
Sylveon Sylveon is technically also a (22:42 - 22:47)
better Wigglytuff but my video explains (22:44 - 22:49)
why you should just go Wigglytuff (22:47 - 22:51)
instead of Sylveon but on paper Sylveon (22:49 - 22:54)
is better um Deli bird Tyranitar (22:51 - 22:57)
Charizard beware Quagsire for those (22:54 - 23:00)
coming up to uh suun if you did get a (22:57 - 23:03)
good Quire the Japanese players are (23:00 - 23:06)
saying it&#39;s a and then (23:03 - 23:09)
Venusaur and they do put uh they do put (23:06 - 23:15)
Mr Golduck and Mr karant into the D tier (23:09 - 23:18)
here (23:15 - 23:18)
so different play Styles I mean when you (23:19 - 23:23)
look at like VGC the Japanese players (23:21 - 23:25)
are always playing a different VGC game (23:23 - 23:26)
than the American players or the (23:25 - 23:29)
European players but I think the (23:26 - 23:30)
takeaway here (23:29 - 23:33)
is one now you know some of the a tier (23:30 - 23:35)
Pokemon if you&#39;re new to Pokemon sleep (23:33 - 23:37)
but also like there are there&#39;s no like (23:35 - 23:40)
right or wrong way toay play Pokemon (23:37 - 23:45)
sleep yeah what okay so I&#39;m I&#39;m Golduck (23:40 - 23:47)
D tier I&#39;m sure Steve&#39;s sitting there (23:45 - 23:48)
like I knew it I&#39;ve been saying it this (23:47 - 23:50)
whole time it&#39;s not as good as everybody (23:48 - 23:53)
says what is gold I haven&#39;t like I (23:50 - 23:55)
looked at this and then I forgot to go (23:53 - 23:57)
look at what Golduck like what is (23:55 - 23:59)
golduck&#39;s skill and everything cuz I (23:57 - 24:01)
don&#39;t actually I&#39;ve never I don&#39;t even (23:59 - 24:02)
have a Golduck I like never evolved a (24:01 - 24:06)
Psyduck or anything golduck&#39;s skill is (24:02 - 24:09)
like proing to just boost (24:06 - 24:12)
snorlax&#39;s um charge power MH oh like (24:09 - 24:15)
Gastly like Geo like those ones yeah (24:12 - 24:19)
like like a Gengar or um Aeros does that (24:15 - 24:21)
as well I think Raichu also does it (24:19 - 24:24)
quaal does it like yeah but (24:21 - 24:27)
but Golduck does it the best because of (24:24 - 24:31)
how often it does it so like because Den (24:27 - 24:32)
procs so (24:31 - 24:35)
much you just like apply that to Golduck (24:32 - 24:38)
but instead of charge power so you could (24:35 - 24:41)
like let&#39;s let&#39;s just say for ease of (24:38 - 24:43)
use and you&#39;re not Bob and you&#39;re not (24:41 - 24:44)
using a good camp ticket every single (24:43 - 24:47)
week let&#39;s just say you&#39;re getting like (24:44 - 24:49)
30,000 a (24:47 - 24:52)
meal so it&#39;s about like 90,000 a day (24:49 - 24:55)
because Golduck procs so much he&#39;s also (24:52 - 24:57)
getting you probably an extra 30 to (24:55 - 25:00)
40,000 a day assuming that you have a (24:57 - 25:02)
perfect Golduck right you need like (25:00 - 25:04)
skill trigger small skill trigger medium (25:02 - 25:06)
main skill trigger up usually helping (25:04 - 25:07)
speed like you need a very specific (25:06 - 25:09)
Golduck But ultimately you&#39;re getting a (25:07 - 25:12)
free fourth meal with Golduck the way I (25:09 - 25:15)
see it and I think why did Den is ranked (25:12 - 25:17)
s here for Japanese players is because (25:15 - 25:20)
if you can hit one critical hit you&#39;re (25:17 - 25:23)
doubling one of your meals yeah which is (25:20 - 25:26)
ultimately that fourth meal that Golduck (25:23 - 25:28)
gets without needing to get a very (25:26 - 25:31)
specific Golduck and check the game (25:28 - 25:33)
frequently um because Golduck does (25:31 - 25:34)
require you to like log (25:33 - 25:38)
in to oh sure does it does it Bank does (25:34 - 25:39)
it it&#39;s a SK it&#39;s a skills Pokemon right (25:38 - 25:42)
or no is it a it is skill yes it it&#39;ll (25:39 - 25:45)
Bank too but it&#39;ll Bank too but you want (25:42 - 25:46)
you want to hit it as much as possible (25:45 - 25:49)
yeah uh whereas like Den is holding to (25:46 - 25:51)
meal but the thing is like why I think (25:49 - 25:55)
Den is better than Golduck is because (25:51 - 25:57)
you&#39;re in order for Golduck to be good (25:55 - 26:00)
it has to be what SE like rank seven (25:57 - 26:03)
yeah yeah and and that type of Pokemon (26:00 - 26:06)
um I feel like any Pokemon that has the (26:03 - 26:09)
charge strength ability right it&#39;s only (26:06 - 26:11)
good for the first couple of days (26:09 - 26:13)
because once you get into like Ultra and (26:11 - 26:16)
master the the return on the charge (26:13 - 26:19)
strengths are not as impactful as early (26:16 - 26:22)
on in the week now with Golduck I think (26:19 - 26:25)
it does arrange right so it you have a (26:22 - 26:27)
little bit more RNG based on actually (26:25 - 26:29)
how much energy (26:27 - 26:32)
gets given to Snorlax when it procs for (26:29 - 26:35)
me I have an Espeon an Espeon is Char (26:32 - 26:38)
charge strength medium which is always a (26:35 - 26:41)
guaranteed amount of power when it gets (26:38 - 26:46)
proed to for Snorlax so I think to to (26:41 - 26:48)
that point is that I don&#39;t use Golduck (26:46 - 26:50)
because it&#39;s just too much RNG and I (26:48 - 26:52)
don&#39;t like the it could be it could be (26:50 - 26:54)
between X and Y you don&#39;t know what (26:52 - 26:56)
exactly power you&#39;re going to get if (26:54 - 26:58)
this procs whereas Espeon I know exact (26:56 - 27:01)
how much I&#39;m getting and it&#39;s double (26:58 - 27:03)
yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s my like deal with I (27:01 - 27:05)
have like quack swell right now and then (27:03 - 27:07)
because I&#39;m holding off because for (27:05 - 27:09)
water week or for speaking week I have a (27:07 - 27:11)
quack swell and then I have a Haunter (27:09 - 27:13)
right now and it&#39;s like Haunter is (27:11 - 27:16)
always proing but it&#39;s less because it&#39;s (27:13 - 27:17)
just a range right where quack I know (27:16 - 27:19)
exactly what I&#39;m going to get every time (27:17 - 27:20)
because it&#39;s that like exact amount (27:19 - 27:22)
instead of having that range yeah P (27:20 - 27:24)
Widow is like also an exact amount it is (27:22 - 27:27)
yeah and I you and just to let folks (27:24 - 27:28)
know never be afraid to swap team (27:27 - 27:30)
members out in the middle of a week like (27:28 - 27:33)
once the first couple of days go by I (27:30 - 27:35)
take out my Espeon I&#39;m like okay you&#39;ve (27:33 - 27:37)
done your work the first get me from (27:35 - 27:40)
Pokeball tier to ultra you did the most (27:37 - 27:42)
work I&#39;m gonna take you out and I might (27:40 - 27:45)
put in another um cooking power up man I (27:42 - 27:47)
might do another extra tasty man or (27:45 - 27:49)
another Berry man so never be afraid to (27:47 - 27:51)
like swap out throughout the week like (27:49 - 27:53)
like one slot and put someone in because (27:51 - 27:54)
I think for that Pokemon that type of (27:53 - 27:56)
charge power it&#39;s really only good for (27:54 - 27:57)
the first couple of days then you just (27:56 - 27:59)
take it out and then reset (27:57 - 28:01)
I think the thing too is you always you (27:59 - 28:02)
always hear about Golduck and it&#39;s like (28:01 - 28:04)
it has to be rank seven which is like a (28:02 - 28:07)
lot of gold skill seeds right and I I (28:04 - 28:08)
think like what if you just applied (28:07 - 28:11)
those gold skill seeds to den like my (28:08 - 28:14)
Den has is is just one it has no gold (28:11 - 28:18)
skill seeds it&#39;s getting four then eight (28:14 - 28:20)
then 12 then 16 but if you had like even (28:18 - 28:22)
gold skill strength three to den that&#39;s (28:20 - 28:26)
what like 6 12 18 like (28:22 - 28:29)
mhm you&#39;re getting a fourth meal with (28:26 - 28:32)
Den like you are with Golduck but for me (28:29 - 28:37)
Den is also increasing my meal (28:32 - 28:39)
powers and making my meals stronger (28:37 - 28:42)
right if I&#39;m critting meals more often I (28:39 - 28:44)
am then getting stronger meals and I&#39;m (28:42 - 28:47)
like not a player that has like 60 60 60 (28:44 - 28:49)
for my meal power but (28:47 - 28:53)
like when I go from 51 to 52 or 52 to 53 (28:49 - 28:55)
it&#39;s like I&#39;m going there because I&#39;ve (28:53 - 28:57)
crit that meal so many times and it&#39;s (28:55 - 28:58)
just jumping and now that meal is (28:57 - 29:00)
getting stronger and stronger so I could (28:58 - 29:03)
see like the argument of like well all (29:00 - 29:06)
my meals are 60 so (29:03 - 29:09)
I can&#39;t increase them anymore but like I (29:06 - 29:10)
don&#39;t know the game&#39;s been out for a (29:09 - 29:12)
year and none of my meals are 60 because (29:10 - 29:14)
they just raised the cap from 55 to 60 (29:12 - 29:16)
MH yeah so I don&#39;t know I feel like to (29:14 - 29:19)
me Den is is that fourth meal plus (29:16 - 29:22)
making all my meals stronger on top of (29:19 - 29:24)
that unless you have the worst RNG and (29:22 - 29:27)
you&#39;re just like not critting and that (29:24 - 29:29)
happens everybody critting this week in (29:27 - 29:31)
the slack everybody&#39;s like I&#39;m getting (29:29 - 29:32)
crits left and right and I was like I&#39;ve (29:31 - 29:35)
got like 60% right now on my cram and (29:32 - 29:38)
I&#39;m not hitting crits what&#39;s going (29:35 - 29:40)
on I feel like I&#39;m getting always one (29:38 - 29:42)
crit a day with the den when I&#39;m running (29:40 - 29:45)
to den yeah nice that&#39;s (29:42 - 29:49)
good uh okay let&#39;s take a quick break (29:45 - 29:50)

you play Masters casually or if you&#39;ve (31:26 - 31:30)
taken a break from (31:28 - 31:32)
Masters I think they&#39;re obviously (31:30 - 31:34)
leading up to probably what Volo and (31:32 - 31:37)
archus or whoever they decide to put (31:34 - 31:40)
archus with would they do Volo and (31:37 - 31:45)
archus because wouldn&#39;t they do Volo and (31:40 - 31:45)
gutina we&#39;ve we&#39;ve established in the (31:45 - 31:49)
last five years that sometimes they (31:47 - 31:51)
don&#39;t (31:49 - 31:53)
really I feel like it should be like (31:51 - 31:57)
archus with Volo like other way around I (31:53 - 31:58)
feel like I feel like (31:57 - 32:01)
archus with archus or something archus (31:58 - 32:03)
should be its own its own thing I want (32:01 - 32:05)
to see archus in his suit that would be (32:03 - 32:09)
pretty yes no no actual human just (32:05 - 32:12)
archus did I say archus and archus or (32:09 - 32:15)
did I say Volo and (32:12 - 32:18)
archus he said archus and (32:15 - 32:20)
arus that&#39;s how it should be no I stand (32:18 - 32:22)
by (32:20 - 32:22)
this uh there&#39;s also a anniversary 2024 (32:23 - 32:31)
Lily and soo soo (32:27 - 32:34)
soo um that that is also (32:31 - 32:36)
available uh and she goes away on (32:34 - 32:39)
October 1st as (32:36 - 32:43)
well and uh yeah that&#39;s the whole event (32:39 - 32:46)
I don&#39;t know how good these are I don&#39;t (32:43 - 32:48)
think a lot of people polling care about (32:46 - 32:49)
how good they are well the hardcore (32:48 - 32:52)
people but like I think people just like (32:49 - 32:54)
Cynthia a lot or just like Steven Stone (32:52 - 32:56)
a lot or just like Lance and they&#39;re (32:54 - 32:57)
going to pull in the thing that they (32:56 - 33:00)
like (32:57 - 33:00)
is there a big is there a big Pokemon (33:00 - 33:08)
Masters Community or is it like small (33:04 - 33:11)
but a lot of (33:08 - 33:12)
whales (33:11 - 33:15)
um there there is a pretty active (33:12 - 33:17)
subreddit for Pokemon Masters uh but (33:15 - 33:20)
when it comes down to (33:17 - 33:20)
like I I don&#39;t know how it is in Japan (33:21 - 33:27)
or I I I don&#39;t think like there&#39;s a lot (33:25 - 33:29)
of Pokemon Masters stuff specifically on (33:27 - 33:32)
Twitter um there there are like in our (33:29 - 33:34)
slack or our Discord there are there is (33:32 - 33:36)
like Masters channels and people are (33:34 - 33:38)
always sharing their polls or what (33:36 - 33:39)
they&#39;re excited for what they&#39;re saving (33:38 - 33:43)
up for I I think it&#39;s there I just I (33:39 - 33:46)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s very (33:43 - 33:48)
big right but I don&#39;t think Masters has (33:46 - 33:52)
ever been super big not that it needs to (33:48 - 33:55)
be super big because I&#39;m we talk about (33:52 - 33:57)
that it makes a good amount of money uh (33:55 - 34:00)
but even like content creator wise like (33:57 - 34:02)
there&#39;s not a lot of people making (34:00 - 34:05)
Masters YouTube videos or Tik toks or (34:02 - 34:06)
anything like that and then the people (34:05 - 34:07)
who (34:06 - 34:10)
do um they don&#39;t get like a lot of views (34:07 - 34:14)
not compared to like hanai or genin or (34:10 - 34:15)
what is (34:14 - 34:18)
that boy band one it&#39;s like number two (34:15 - 34:19)
in the world right now I can&#39;t remember (34:18 - 34:22)
what it&#39;s called but yeah it it it (34:19 - 34:24)
doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t come close to the (34:22 - 34:26)
audiences of those other guys but I (34:24 - 34:28)
think those games have more fan service (34:26 - 34:32)
than Pokemon games (34:28 - 34:35)
do I mean they they they showed (34:32 - 34:37)
Cynthia&#39;s armpits that&#39;s is that&#39;s (34:35 - 34:39)
that&#39;s a lot of fan service for for a (34:37 - 34:41)
Pokemon (34:39 - 34:41)
game I mean I will say for for this game (34:41 - 34:48)
going what five years strong now and um (34:44 - 34:49)
I you know I always see them putting out (34:48 - 34:52)
events like this and trying (34:49 - 34:55)
to satisfy the fan base like you know (34:52 - 34:56)
here&#39;s the characters you want but now (34:55 - 34:58)
they have different outfits and and the (34:56 - 35:00)
one thing I I always enjoyed about the (34:58 - 35:02)
game was just like the subtle just voice (35:00 - 35:04)
acting in it just you know it gives it (35:02 - 35:07)
some personality you get to hear some (35:04 - 35:09)
characters and their voices differ from (35:07 - 35:12)
the anime and and then you know these (35:09 - 35:14)
are things I wish we had in the main (35:12 - 35:18)
titles on the Nintendo switch uh but (35:14 - 35:20)
I&#39;ve always appreciated that fact and (35:18 - 35:21)
but I&#39;m in the boat where if I see a (35:20 - 35:24)
character I like and they have a awesome (35:21 - 35:27)
looking suit and if I pull it great I (35:24 - 35:28)
closed the game out and I&#39;ll come back (35:27 - 35:31)
to it maybe in like two months but um I (35:28 - 35:32)
haven&#39;t really done the like I I was (35:31 - 35:34)
into the battling part of it early on (35:32 - 35:36)
but then I just fell off of it because (35:34 - 35:39)
um I never you know gravitated toward it (35:36 - 35:40)
I I I didn&#39;t really found find it (35:39 - 35:42)
enjoyable I just found more the (35:40 - 35:45)
collecting part of the characters more (35:42 - 35:47)
enjoyable than the actual gameplay (35:45 - 35:50)
itself yeah that makes (35:47 - 35:52)
sense Bobby you you red (35:50 - 35:54)
downloaded I&#39;m going to actually going (35:52 - 35:56)
to right now I&#39;m going to redownload it (35:54 - 35:58)
I I I feel like every once in a while I (35:56 - 36:00)
end up redownloading this game like it&#39;s (35:58 - 36:02)
always at a time like this where there&#39;s (36:00 - 36:05)
a bunch of uh pulls you can get or a you (36:02 - 36:07)
know gems some kind of event um I (36:05 - 36:09)
usually do play it for a little bit and (36:07 - 36:11)
then it ends up off my phone again at (36:09 - 36:13)
some point uh so we&#39;ll see if it sticks (36:11 - 36:15)
this time maybe this will be the time (36:13 - 36:17)
when it sticks you never know you never (36:15 - 36:23)
know I&#39;m waiting for Pokemon Masters GX (36:17 - 36:26)
actually it&#39;s the Yu-Gi-Oh crossover (36:23 - 36:29)
yeah yeah yeah I do I do Wonder cuz they (36:26 - 36:31)
they did make remember after the first (36:29 - 36:32)
year they were like from we&#39;re going (36:31 - 36:34)
from Pokemon Masters to Pokemon Masters (36:32 - 36:36)
ex and then there was like a weird (36:34 - 36:38)
hashtag that they used for about two (36:36 - 36:41)
days and then they stopped using yep (36:38 - 36:44)
which is very funny at the same time uh (36:41 - 36:46)
but I do wonder if there&#39;s ever a point (36:44 - 36:48)
even you could look at a game like Cafe (36:46 - 36:50)
remix right it was Cafe mix and then (36:48 - 36:54)
they changed it to remix like does (36:50 - 36:56)
Masters you know go if if Masters is (36:54 - 36:57)
going to be around for another five (36:56 - 37:00)
years do they need (36:57 - 37:03)
like a big update I don&#39;t know if they (37:00 - 37:05)
really needed one after a year but they (37:03 - 37:09)
felt the need to yeah interesting (37:05 - 37:12)
decision uh but I do I do Wonder because (37:09 - 37:17)
I&#39;m sure it according to the the the the (37:12 - 37:20)
numbers it&#39;s doing fine MoneyWise but (37:17 - 37:22)
you know these companies they like even (37:20 - 37:24)
more money they like more people playing (37:22 - 37:28)
their games and giving them money so yep (37:24 - 37:30)
I don&#39;t know but DNA is also working on (37:28 - 37:33)
pocket so they were clearly happy enough (37:30 - 37:35)
with DNA the last couple years to be (37:33 - 37:37)
like here&#39;s another game so that&#39;s (37:35 - 37:39)
that&#39;s good for DNA at least well I&#39;m (37:37 - 37:44)
waiting for pocket Y which will be yeah (37:39 - 37:47)
2025 game I&#39;m not even going to play (37:44 - 37:49)
Pocket until the EX version comes out I (37:47 - 37:53)
love the long game from Bobby here (37:49 - 37:53)
is uh let&#39;s just let&#39;s just uh I don&#39;t (37:55 - 38:01)
know how long this uh TCG Legend Za news (37:58 - 38:03)
is going to be so let&#39;s just knock out (38:01 - 38:05)
the Pokemon Go stuff out of the way here (38:03 - 38:08)
get all our mobile games out of the way (38:05 - 38:12)
there is a new pokecoin Bounty did we (38:08 - 38:13)
talk about this last week Bobby I don&#39;t (38:12 - 38:16)
think we did it wasn&#39;t it just got (38:13 - 38:19)
announced okay the other day two days (38:16 - 38:22)
ago three days ago got it uh so starting (38:19 - 38:24)
on September 1st trainers can purchase a (38:22 - 38:27)
daily pokecoin Bounty part one ticket (38:24 - 38:29)
for the leg latest season of Pokémon go (38:27 - 38:31)
maxed out this ticket will help trainers (38:29 - 38:35)
max out trainers max out their words not (38:31 - 38:37)
mine their Adventures by the daily bonus (38:35 - 38:40)

coins (38:40 - 38:47)
um and that will technically start on (38:43 - 38:49)
Tuesday so you can buy the ticket now (38:47 - 38:51)
and I believe when you buy the ticket (38:49 - 38:54)
you get 200 coins right away and then (38:51 - 38:56)
you get 20 coins for (38:54 - 38:59)
every daily field research you do which (38:56 - 39:02)
it used to be 25 when they did this but (38:59 - 39:03)
I don&#39;t (39:02 - 39:06)
remember if you got the 200 coins off (39:03 - 39:10)
the bat I don&#39;t I I bought I bought the (39:06 - 39:13)
thing too and I don&#39;t remember I don&#39;t (39:10 - 39:14)
think you did I don&#39;t think you did you (39:13 - 39:16)
didn&#39;t you just had the you just got the (39:14 - 39:21)
25 every day as long as you had a slot (39:16 - 39:26)
available for that research task yes so (39:21 - 39:29)
I I the the the instant complaint I saw (39:26 - 39:33)
was it used to be 25 now it&#39;s 20 Niantic (39:29 - 39:36)
really needs that 5 cents a day but it (39:33 - 39:39)
was 25 but only for like two weeks was (39:36 - 39:41)
it yeah it wasn&#39;t a whole month it (39:39 - 39:42)
definitely wasn&#39;t a whole month it was (39:41 - 39:45)
like half it was half of a month oh they (39:42 - 39:46)
didn&#39;t they they have not done this for (39:45 - 39:48)
a whole month they did that for the twoe (39:46 - 39:50)
period I remember yeah it was just one (39:48 - 39:53)
time it was like $2 and you got 25 coins (39:50 - 39:55)
a day I believe if that&#39;s what people (39:53 - 39:57)
were talking about and you got 25 coins (39:55 - 39:59)
a day but maybe they&#39;re talking about (39:57 - 40:00)
something else because now that I think (39:59 - 40:02)
about (40:00 - 40:05)
it I thought that was 20 coins a day it (40:02 - 40:06)
was like that it was like a couple (40:05 - 40:08)
months ago it was just like a two- week (40:06 - 40:12)
event and you got a few coins a day as (40:08 - 40:14)
long as you had the research task like (40:12 - 40:17)
as long as you had didn&#39;t have a full (40:14 - 40:19)
stack of research (40:17 - 40:21)
tasks I&#39;ve done the (40:19 - 40:24)
math if it was 25 coins a day for 30 (40:21 - 40:27)
days that would be 750 coins it wasn&#39;t (40:24 - 40:29)
that many for sure it wasn&#39;t that 7 it (40:27 - 40:32)
wasn&#39;t 750 and if you&#39;re getting 20 (40:29 - 40:35)
coins a day for 30 days that&#39;s 600 coins (40:32 - 40:37)
but you&#39;re getting the 200 at the start (40:35 - 40:39)
of the month so you&#39;re getting 800 coins (40:37 - 40:43)
instead of 750 coins so if we&#39;re getting (40:39 - 40:47)
technical about it this is a better deal (40:43 - 40:49)
by 50 (40:47 - 40:53)
Cents sounds like (40:49 - 40:53)
it thank you Niantic we appreciate the (40:53 - 40:58)
extra 50 cents (40:56 - 41:01)
um trainers can purchase the gift ticket (40:58 - 41:03)
yeah and give it to somebody you can (41:01 - 41:06)
also go (41:03 - 41:06)
to store. pookemon (41:06 - 41:12)
go.com or whatever and you can purchase (41:09 - 41:14)
three months in ADV like all three (41:12 - 41:16)
months for the max out because it&#39;s $5 a (41:14 - 41:18)
month every month and these Seasons last (41:16 - 41:20)
three months so it&#39;s (41:18 - 41:22)
$15 (41:20 - 41:24)
for how many coins is that going to be (41:22 - 41:29)
800 time 380 is 2,4 100 coins and but (41:24 - 41:32)
then on the website you get a bonus 100 (41:29 - 41:35)
coins you get a bonus dollar for not (41:32 - 41:37)
paying the Apple tax well you get a (41:35 - 41:39)
bonus dollar however you are (41:37 - 41:44)
paying two more cents just so you know (41:39 - 41:46)
if you don&#39;t buy each ticket because (41:44 - 41:49)
each ticket each month would be (41:46 - 41:51)
$14.97 if you buy it off the web store (41:49 - 41:53)
it&#39;s (41:51 - 41:56)
$14.99 so you have to take it we&#39;re if (41:53 - 41:57)
we&#39;re going to split this the way that (41:56 - 41:59)
people are doing it you are paying an (41:57 - 42:04)
extra two cents if you buy it on the web (41:59 - 42:04)
store ntic you do get the bonus 100 (42:04 - 42:11)
coins on the web store too so you do get (42:07 - 42:14)
okay so just the coin thing (42:11 - 42:17)
aside you there are more bonuses to this (42:14 - 42:19)
so this ticket will get you three times (42:17 - 42:22)
the XP for your first Catch of the Day (42:19 - 42:24)
three times the XP for your first spin (42:22 - 42:28)
of the day 50 you can open up to from 20 (42:24 - 42:31)
to 50 gifts per day you can also hold 40 (42:28 - 42:34)
gifts per bag instead of 20 and you can (42:31 - 42:37)
get 100 gifts per day from Poké stops (42:34 - 42:41)
and gyms instead of 150 instead of a (42:37 - 42:41)
100 and there&#39;s a (42:42 - 42:48)
bounty uh if you complete oh okay so (42:45 - 42:50)
maybe you don&#39;t get the 200 coins right (42:48 - 42:51)
away you have to do the Bounty complete (42:50 - 42:53)
the time to research to get your 200 (42:51 - 42:58)
bonus coins your, 1500 XP and your 1,500 (42:53 - 43:01)
Stardust isn&#39;t it 15,000 sorry yeah (42:58 - 43:04)
15,000 yeah okay 15,000 XP 15,000 (43:01 - 43:06)
Stardust I wish it was 15,000 coins that (43:04 - 43:08)
would be great that would that would (43:06 - 43:11)
really $100 worth you would really be (43:08 - 43:14)
moving tickets at that point love (43:11 - 43:18)
it so uh full disclosure I was in a (43:14 - 43:19)
meeting with Niantic when they talked (43:18 - 43:23)
about a lot of this Max up max out stuff (43:19 - 43:26)
uh I don&#39;t remember what what has been (43:23 - 43:27)
released or what hasn&#39;t been released (43:26 - 43:28)
that&#39;s why I&#39;m only going off the (43:27 - 43:30)
website so I don&#39;t get in trouble I (43:28 - 43:32)
asked them specifically during this (43:30 - 43:35)
meeting is this a subscription because (43:32 - 43:37)
they didn&#39;t give all of these details at (43:35 - 43:41)
the time and they said no it&#39;s not (43:37 - 43:43)
because we&#39;re really close to a (43:41 - 43:46)
subscription here and it&#39;s not so I (43:43 - 43:49)
don&#39;t know why this isn&#39;t a (43:46 - 43:52)
subscription but (43:49 - 43:54)
like I I I don&#39;t (43:52 - 43:57)
know Pokemon Masters has a subscription (43:54 - 43:59)
Pokemon has a subscription Pokemon sleep (43:57 - 44:00)
has a (43:59 - 44:03)
subscription why does this game refuse (44:00 - 44:06)
to do subscriptions are they are they (44:03 - 44:08)
afraid of money and commitment I I mean (44:06 - 44:11)
I I feel like I feel like they are close (44:08 - 44:14)
to it yeah this this definitely has that (44:11 - 44:17)
sprinkling of Let&#39;s test this out let&#39;s (44:14 - 44:19)
see how many people are actually going (44:17 - 44:22)
to buy into something like this and I (44:19 - 44:24)
would not be surprised if maybe sometime (44:22 - 44:26)
early next year they they you know they (44:24 - 44:28)
look at the data okay let&#39;s roll (44:26 - 44:31)
something out out a per monthly basis (44:28 - 44:33)
because as you know I am paying per (44:31 - 44:36)
month for Pokemon sleep I think there&#39;s (44:33 - 44:38)
good value behind it I get my free good (44:36 - 44:40)
camp ticket just think I mean you know I (44:38 - 44:42)
I&#39;m curious if people would pay a (44:40 - 44:43)
monthly subscription for Pokemon go if (44:42 - 44:45)
it does mean you know you get the (44:43 - 44:48)
boosted you know gift openings you get (44:45 - 44:50)
some extra coins you get some extra XP (44:48 - 44:52)
and it&#39;s consistent throughout all the (44:50 - 44:54)
events that even come on top of that um (44:52 - 44:56)
I think people would definitely jump on (44:54 - 44:58)
the opportunity to do a (44:56 - 44:59)
per month subscription on something like (44:58 - 45:01)
this and it&#39;s I think it&#39;s they should (44:59 - 45:03)
do it sooner than later because it&#39;s (45:01 - 45:04)
been around for a (45:03 - 45:09)
bit yeah no totally agree um I think (45:04 - 45:10)
this is like you said this is so close (45:09 - 45:12)
to a sub like literally there could just (45:10 - 45:16)
be an auto renew button and it&#39;s that&#39;s (45:12 - 45:17)
it it&#39;s a subscription now right that (45:16 - 45:19)
this is that is what this is you just (45:17 - 45:22)
have to click it every month or go to (45:19 - 45:24)
the web store and you get it every three (45:22 - 45:27)
months you know um but I think I don&#39;t (45:24 - 45:29)
know I mean I&#39;m okay with this like the (45:27 - 45:32)
only thing I don&#39;t like about this and I (45:29 - 45:34)
didn&#39;t like it back in that may event as (45:32 - 45:36)
well so I just looked it up and there (45:34 - 45:38)
was a May event it was two weeks long (45:36 - 45:40)
you got 20 coins per day so the people (45:38 - 45:42)
talking about 25 coins they must be (45:40 - 45:45)
talking about something else cuz yes or (45:42 - 45:47)
that was the Australia thing they tested (45:45 - 45:49)
that was yeah that was the Australia (45:47 - 45:52)
thing with the 25 coins um the two we (45:49 - 45:54)
event back in May it was 20 coins a day (45:52 - 45:56)
same thing anyways but that was like two (45:54 - 45:58)
weeks right two weeks two weeks it was (45:56 - 46:00)
May 16th through the 30th you got 300 (45:58 - 46:03)
coins if you uh you know got your coins (46:00 - 46:05)
every day that&#39;s the only thing I don&#39;t (46:03 - 46:09)
like about this is that it&#39;s not (46:05 - 46:12)
guaranteed coins because you have one (46:09 - 46:14)
there&#39;s a time to research so like the (46:12 - 46:15)
200 coins you&#39;re talking about is a (46:14 - 46:17)
timed research so that&#39;s you know if you (46:15 - 46:19)
don&#39;t finish it in time you don&#39;t get (46:17 - 46:21)
200 coins who knows how easy that is but (46:19 - 46:24)
that&#39;s like beside the point here uh the (46:21 - 46:26)
second thing is is you do have to log in (46:24 - 46:28)
every day or you do have to get that (46:26 - 46:30)
research task every day because if you (46:28 - 46:33)
already have your research tasks filled (46:30 - 46:35)
so if you have three plus your bonus (46:33 - 46:38)
already sitting in your list you don&#39;t (46:35 - 46:40)
get the 20 coin research task for that (46:38 - 46:43)
day so you miss out on those coins is (46:40 - 46:46)
this fixed where let&#39;s say you have your (46:43 - 46:50)
three does this prioritize that bonus (46:46 - 46:53)
over the I tried it I believe I remember (46:50 - 46:55)
it does so like if you have three (46:53 - 46:57)
instead of your bonus being some random (46:55 - 46:59)
like five Pine apps for something it&#39;s (46:57 - 47:02)
the 20 coin task that you get but if you (46:59 - 47:04)
have like yesterday&#39;s bonus and then (47:02 - 47:07)
three tasks so you have four sitting in (47:04 - 47:08)
your list already you don&#39;t get you (47:07 - 47:11)
don&#39;t get the next Day&#39;s coins task so (47:08 - 47:14)
you miss out on let&#39;s say I have the 20 (47:11 - 47:17)
coin from Wednesday and then I delete (47:14 - 47:19)
one above it do I get the 20 coin from (47:17 - 47:20)
Wednesday and then when Thursday rolls (47:19 - 47:22)
over I get the 20 coin from Thursday you (47:20 - 47:24)
have test that one for science Steve I (47:22 - 47:26)
don&#39;t know I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t go as far (47:24 - 47:28)
as to do that when (47:26 - 47:31)
have research if if if they if they (47:28 - 47:33)
want see when I think of like Pokémon go (47:31 - 47:34)
subscription and what they&#39;re going to (47:33 - 47:36)
charge I do feel like they could get (47:34 - 47:38)
away with like $10 a month Pokemon sleep (47:36 - 47:40)
gets away with $10 a month I think unite (47:38 - 47:44)
is also $10 a month um and I do think (47:40 - 47:47)
like the gift thing is like an easy (47:44 - 47:49)
given to a subscription player and (47:47 - 47:52)
personally I like it I love having 40 (47:49 - 47:55)
gifts because when I travel I try to (47:52 - 47:57)
stock up on really cool gifts like when (47:55 - 47:59)
I was in Japan I was like I want the I (47:57 - 48:01)
want the like the Pokey lid I want this (47:59 - 48:03)
cool Lapras Pokey lid I want as many as (48:01 - 48:04)
I can while I&#39;m like sitting here eating (48:03 - 48:06)
lunch and I&#39;m like like deleting gifts (48:04 - 48:09)
and spinning to get as many but (48:06 - 48:12)
then I can&#39;t hold other gifts as well so (48:09 - 48:13)
like you go somewhere else and you&#39;re (48:12 - 48:15)
like ah this is a cool Poké stop but I (48:13 - 48:17)
I&#39;m like I have like 10 Lapras and then (48:15 - 48:19)
I have these other ones and I want to (48:17 - 48:21)
like send them to people and that&#39;s hard (48:19 - 48:23)
when you&#39;re traveling cuz you&#39;re like (48:21 - 48:25)
you don&#39;t want to sit there and be like (48:23 - 48:26)
okay I&#39;m going to send a bunch of cuz (48:25 - 48:28)
it&#39;s it is time assuming right well (48:26 - 48:29)
that&#39;s your problem is you&#39;re traveling (48:28 - 48:33)
you live like me Steve and you stay home (48:29 - 48:35)
and then you don&#39;t you just have boring (48:33 - 48:37)
gifts to give to (48:35 - 48:41)
people so I I think the holding more (48:37 - 48:43)
gifts opening more gifts collecting more (48:41 - 48:45)
gifts I think would be built into a (48:43 - 48:46)
subscription I think the three times (48:45 - 48:47)
your first catch the three times your (48:46 - 48:49)
spin yeah sure that makes sense that (48:47 - 48:51)
doesn&#39;t change anything the 20 coins you (48:49 - 48:55)
are spending $5 to ultimately get $8 (48:51 - 48:57)
back if you do play every day every day (48:55 - 49:00)
so again I think that&#39;s great for what (48:57 - 49:01)
should be a subscription I think the (49:00 - 49:04)
only thing I might add would be and I&#39;ve (49:01 - 49:06)
been saying this for eight years so (49:04 - 49:08)
it&#39;ll never happen but I think a while (49:06 - 49:10)
you&#39;re in quote unquote subscription (49:08 - 49:14)
mode you should get another permanent (49:10 - 49:17)
incubator so you have two instead of one (49:14 - 49:18)
and then when your subscription is (49:17 - 49:22)
canceled you go back to one y I think (49:18 - 49:23)
that and it not like a super incubator (49:22 - 49:26)
just like a regular incubator I think (49:23 - 49:29)
that would like solidify easy a $10 (49:26 - 49:31)
subscription for a lot of players do I (49:29 - 49:33)
think they should do more yes 100% but I (49:31 - 49:35)
think the bare minimum should be what is (49:33 - 49:38)
here plus another permanent incubator I (49:35 - 49:40)
don&#39;t know what else they would a (49:38 - 49:43)
permanent incubator could potentially be (49:40 - 49:45)
worth a lot of money I mean money as far (49:43 - 49:47)
as what it cost to right because it&#39;s (49:45 - 49:49)
150 coins for if you just think 150 (49:47 - 49:51)
coins for an incubator and if you&#39;re (49:49 - 49:53)
sitting there hatching 2K eggs for the (49:51 - 49:56)
month with that incubator I mean that&#39;s (49:53 - 49:59)
potentially lot of but but they&#39;re doing (49:56 - 50:01)
what they want you to do which is like (49:59 - 50:03)
you have to leave the house no no I (50:01 - 50:04)
think it would be great I think it would (50:03 - 50:05)
be no I&#39;m saying I think it would be (50:04 - 50:07)
that would be awesome if they did (50:05 - 50:10)
something like that because um yeah that (50:07 - 50:12)
would be wonderful to your point it that (50:10 - 50:13)
they probably will never do it because (50:12 - 50:15)
we&#39;re sitting here saying how great of (50:13 - 50:19)
an idea this is but you never know you (50:15 - 50:24)
never know um yeah yeah I I I I think (50:19 - 50:26)
it&#39;s a good start and maybe this is I (50:24 - 50:28)
but I feel like they did that what that (50:26 - 50:30)
like three Monon subscription earlier in (50:28 - 50:31)
the year and then they didn&#39;t do (50:30 - 50:33)
anything for the next season and I was (50:31 - 50:35)
like ah this is pretty good yeah but (50:33 - 50:37)
they were testing they were they were (50:35 - 50:39)
absolutely testing things out because (50:37 - 50:40)
they&#39;re always testing where&#39;s the (50:39 - 50:42)
commitment (50:40 - 50:45)
Bobby get a few years of tests in and (50:42 - 50:48)
then maybe we&#39;ll end up with a not as (50:45 - 50:51)
good subscription at some point in (50:48 - 50:53)
time uh and I will say I used my own (50:51 - 50:56)
money I spent the $15 here off the web (50:53 - 50:57)
store (50:56 - 51:01)
for because I wanted to honestly it was (50:57 - 51:02)
the gift thing that pushed me over the (51:01 - 51:03)
edge I was like yeah I&#39;m going to get my (51:02 - 51:05)
money back with coins but like I do want (51:03 - 51:08)
to hold more gifts and be able to send (51:05 - 51:12)
more gifts yeah um yeah I mean so if you (51:08 - 51:15)
play the game every day or if you ever (51:12 - 51:17)
even think about buying (51:15 - 51:20)
coins this it just makes sense to do (51:17 - 51:22)
this because you&#39;re literally getting (51:20 - 51:23)
like we said you&#39;re getting what $8 or (51:22 - 51:28)
$9 worth of coins off of a $5 ticket so (51:23 - 51:31)
if you play daily if you buy coins at (51:28 - 51:33)
all I mean it works out plus you get all (51:31 - 51:34)
the extra stuff you&#39;re talking about (51:33 - 51:36)
gifts and some XP and things like that (51:34 - 51:39)
so yeah yeah I think it works out I (51:36 - 51:43)
think it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s not bad Niantic (51:39 - 51:46)
it could be better but it&#39;s it&#39;s not bad (51:43 - 51:49)
no it&#39;s I think it&#39;s good just the fact (51:46 - 51:50)
that you&#39;re getting your money back you (51:49 - 51:53)
know if like I&#39;m going to buy $5 worth (51:50 - 51:55)
of coins at some point in the month like (51:53 - 51:57)
it&#39;s just going to happen every knows me (51:55 - 51:59)
well enough to know it&#39;s gonna happen (51:57 - 52:01)
like I could tell myself it&#39;s not it&#39;s (51:59 - 52:04)
gonna happen it&#39;s I might as well just (52:01 - 52:07)
put it into this ticket get more than $5 (52:04 - 52:09)
worth of coins and then get some bonuses (52:07 - 52:11)
I think it works nicely it always (52:09 - 52:13)
happens when I do remote raides it&#39;s (52:11 - 52:15)
like oh you listen you need I&#39;m like (52:13 - 52:17)
well you got me there I here&#39;s my here&#39;s (52:15 - 52:19)
my money yep and then it&#39;s like well I (52:17 - 52:21)
just need one ticket but like I really (52:19 - 52:23)
should just get the three remote raid (52:21 - 52:25)
passes cuz why would I just buy one so (52:23 - 52:28)
then it&#39;s you know5 (52:25 - 52:28)
easy um speaking of $5 uh there is going (52:29 - 52:35)
to be a failinks raid day Sunday (52:32 - 52:38)
September 8th from 2: to 5: oh maybe we (52:35 - 52:40)
have to move the podcast up next week I (52:38 - 52:43)
don&#39;t know if I want to do this for $5 (52:40 - 52:45)
though you can purchase a ticket that (52:43 - 52:46)
grants the following bonuses eight (52:45 - 52:49)
additional raid passes for a total of 14 (52:46 - 52:53)
you do get eight for free sorry you get (52:49 - 52:56)
five free raid passes plus your Daily (52:53 - 53:01)
raid pass so you will you will jump up (52:56 - 53:05)

XL 50 more percent 50% more XP and twice (53:07 - 53:12)
the Stardust from raid (53:10 - 53:14)
battles uh I don&#39;t think this the ticket (53:12 - 53:17)
on top of an event that already is free (53:14 - 53:20)
yes so the free event is failing will be (53:17 - 53:22)
appear in raids you&#39;ll get five (53:20 - 53:24)
additional free raid passes increased (53:22 - 53:26)
chance of shiny failinks I think people (53:24 - 53:28)
normally say these are about one in 10 (53:26 - 53:31)
chance um if it&#39;s similar to like cleor (53:28 - 53:33)
or anything like that and then remote (53:31 - 53:36)
raid pass increase will be increased to (53:33 - 53:39)
20 uh from Saturday September 7th to (53:36 - 53:42)
Sunday September 8th so if you really (53:39 - 53:45)
like to spend money Niantic has your (53:42 - 53:47)
back this is where I always screw up (53:45 - 53:50)
because people start sending me invites (53:47 - 53:53)
the day before invit you&#39;re never get (53:50 - 53:55)
you&#39;re never tricking me in a remote (53:53 - 53:58)
remote race it&#39;s people from Japan start (53:55 - 54:00)
sending them to me on when it&#39;s Saturday (53:58 - 54:01)

shiny failinks now and then I get the (54:08 - 54:14)
shiny failinks and then two o&#39;clock hits (54:11 - 54:15)
and I&#39;m like I have all these free (54:14 - 54:19)
passes that I have no point in using now (54:15 - 54:22)
yep yeah should be pretty easy as like (54:19 - 54:24)
you and you and your you and your friend (54:22 - 54:27)
you and your partner um you should be (54:24 - 54:29)
like you should be able to go around (54:27 - 54:32)
town and just be able to duo or even you (54:29 - 54:34)
could solo it so we were looking this up (54:32 - 54:38)
earlier this week uh apparently failinks (54:34 - 54:40)
was supposed to be in raids back in like (54:38 - 54:43)
2021 or 2022 whenever failing like (54:40 - 54:45)
debuted but there was some kind of (54:43 - 54:48)
visual glitch oh it would like stick (54:45 - 54:51)
straight up okay I remember I (54:48 - 54:53)
remember there you go we couldn&#39;t we (54:51 - 54:55)
couldn&#39;t remember what but like we were (54:53 - 54:56)
just I was looking at some stuff in the (54:55 - 55:01)
past and uh so the guides I did look at (54:56 - 55:05)
said it was supposed to be soloable but (55:01 - 55:07)
that it didn&#39;t happen because they ended (55:05 - 55:09)
up just taking it out of the raids and (55:07 - 55:11)
then just having it be research tasks or (55:09 - 55:15)
something so it should be a soloable uh (55:11 - 55:17)
raid if you if you really want to go for (55:15 - 55:19)
it that (55:17 - 55:21)
way well if you&#39;re free next Sunday and (55:19 - 55:22)

Max part particles for your Dynamax (57:00 - 57:09)
needs yeah I do we I think we missed the (57:04 - 57:11)
part of the important thing here is the (57:09 - 57:15)
fact that Galler is coming to Pokemon (57:11 - 57:16)
yeah it&#39;s about time well we talked (57:15 - 57:18)

except for dpy oh no it says Dy will be (57:38 - 57:42)
in the wild actually it says some (57:40 - 57:44)
trainers might encounter dpy as the rare (57:42 - 57:48)
one sovet and wulu will be (57:44 - 57:50)
shiny (57:48 - 57:52)
um they&#39;re putting them in (57:50 - 57:54)
eggs there&#39;s going to be a new (57:52 - 57:57)
collection challenge it&#39;s exciting but (57:54 - 57:59)
Max raids are not coming when these new (57:57 - 58:02)
Pokemon are coming right there will be (57:59 - 58:06)
they&#39;re coming after obviously but you (58:02 - 58:10)
can start getting Max particle (58:06 - 58:13)
power as soon as whatever that bundle is (58:10 - 58:15)
available what did I say September 3rd (58:13 - 58:19)
September 3rd so Y no I mean I&#39;m just (58:15 - 58:21)
excited to have the Galler starters (58:19 - 58:23)
finally in the game like it&#39;s been it&#39;s (58:21 - 58:27)
been too long they&#39;re finally here (58:23 - 58:30)
they&#39;re finally coming uh yeah I&#39;m (58:27 - 58:32)
excited I mean this is this is exactly (58:30 - 58:35)
what I wanted in Pokemon go uh because I (58:32 - 58:37)
I really enjoy this region and this (58:35 - 58:39)
generation so it&#39;s going to be nice to (58:37 - 58:41)
uh have it here and I think Pokemon go (58:39 - 58:44)
may get some my money now for this event (58:41 - 58:48)
so might got might got uh check it out I (58:44 - 58:50)
love how it says 10 10 kilometer eggs Dy (58:48 - 58:54)
and more like it doesn&#39;t get (58:50 - 58:58)
anything get anything else (58:54 - 59:02)
know and more yeah right that&#39;s oh (58:58 - 59:06)
that&#39;s funny um oh speaking of an Moore (59:02 - 59:09)
just a quick tip so rockruff is one of (59:06 - 59:10)
the Pokemon that&#39;s usually in 10 (59:09 - 59:12)
kilometer eggs and I know people love (59:10 - 59:15)
rockruff they love shiny rockruff I&#39;ll (59:12 - 59:18)
give you this this this tip here the (59:15 - 59:21)
best way to try to get shiny rockruff is (59:18 - 59:25)
to use the dusk M or Dawn Wings (59:21 - 59:27)
Adventure effect (59:25 - 59:29)
because rockruff is like a one in (59:27 - 59:35)
75 chance shiny and hatching eggs (59:29 - 59:37)
raiding that&#39;s a lot right but in the (59:35 - 59:39)
with the duskman and the dawn Wings (59:37 - 59:41)
Adventure effect it has a it&#39;s an (59:39 - 59:44)
incense right and it and it spawns a (59:41 - 59:46)
Pokemon once a minute regardless of (59:44 - 59:49)
whether you&#39;re moving or not so and rock (59:46 - 59:51)
rockruff is one of like the seven (59:49 - 59:55)
Pokemon that Spawn from that incense (59:51 - 59:58)
I&#39;ve gotten three shiny rockruff from (59:55 - 60:00)
that from those Adventure effects (59:58 - 60:04)
because again they&#39;re like one in 75 so (60:00 - 60:07)
if you have the candy Stardust and you (60:04 - 60:09)
want shiny rockruff that&#39;s the way to go (60:07 - 60:11)
for it versus hatching eggs or raiding (60:09 - 60:14)
for rockruff rockruff uh I did see (60:11 - 60:16)
people complain that the nitic is (60:14 - 60:19)
selling Max particles or whatever (60:16 - 60:20)
obviously you&#39;ll be able to get these (60:19 - 60:22)
free by just playing the game just like (60:20 - 60:23)
you can get pokeballs free or rocket (60:22 - 60:24)
radar for (60:23 - 60:27)
free I get it (60:24 - 60:28)
their company trying to make money but (60:27 - 60:30)
like this isn&#39;t new I don&#39;t know why (60:28 - 60:32)
people are pretending this isn&#39;t new (60:30 - 60:33)
they&#39;ve been selling rocket Radars for (60:32 - 60:36)
$2 since the debut of Team Rocket how (60:33 - 60:38)
many have I bought since the debut of (60:36 - 60:42)
Team Rocket zero it&#39;s been eight years (60:38 - 60:44)
and I have never given them money for (60:42 - 60:46)
pokeballs I get it I live in a big city (60:44 - 60:48)
it&#39;s very easy for me to get pokeballs (60:46 - 60:49)
but like the easiest thing with this (60:48 - 60:52)
kind of stuff is just don&#39;t buy it it&#39;s (60:49 - 60:56)
fine it exists for people who value time (60:52 - 60:58)
over money and I think that&#39;s valid (60:56 - 61:00)
there&#39;s so many Final Fantasy 14 players (60:58 - 61:02)
or World of Warcraft players that will (61:00 - 61:04)
just buy a $20 level (61:02 - 61:07)
skip because they they just don&#39;t have (61:04 - 61:10)
time to level up and that&#39;s fine because (61:07 - 61:12)
it doesn&#39;t affect me I just don&#39;t buy it (61:10 - 61:16)
yep so like there will be ways to get (61:12 - 61:19)
Max particles that is not $799 you don&#39;t (61:16 - 61:21)
have to freak out it&#39;s fine just like (61:19 - 61:24)
Team Rocket stuff you just skip it same (61:21 - 61:26)
with poffins I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever (61:24 - 61:28)
purchased a pofin that wasn&#39;t like (61:26 - 61:30)
included in a bundle for free I don&#39;t (61:28 - 61:32)
think I&#39;ve ever bought a pofin I bought (61:30 - 61:34)
many poffins when I was really trying to (61:32 - 61:36)
get that 10 best buddies done I finally (61:34 - 61:38)
got I finally got my shiny Gerra early (61:36 - 61:43)
this week and shiny Shaman I finally 554 (61:38 - 61:44)
days after the research came out I (61:43 - 61:47)
finally got my shiny Gerra I&#39;m never (61:44 - 61:48)
getting another best buddy again you (61:47 - 61:51)
don&#39;t like I love the Buddy stuff I (61:48 - 61:54)
don&#39;t at all I don&#39;t I&#39;m constantly (61:51 - 61:57)
switching my buddies while back when GH (61:54 - 61:59)
snapshot wasn&#39;t as good and it&#39;s like (61:57 - 62:01)
the Buddies stuff was better for (61:59 - 62:03)
pictures so I was constantly switching (62:01 - 62:05)
my buddies out I see and then not you (62:03 - 62:08)
know feeding them I I just quick treat (62:05 - 62:12)
golden Raz and by the time I&#39;m done it&#39;s (62:08 - 62:14)
you know I&#39;m getting 10 12 hearts a day (62:12 - 62:16)
yeah I know I I know I should have been (62:14 - 62:17)
better I should be I should be nicer to (62:16 - 62:21)
my Pokemon but how dare you not use the (62:17 - 62:24)
tamagachi feature that nian cares (62:21 - 62:27)
about well I bought po because I I was (62:24 - 62:29)
stuck between that level 41 and level 42 (62:27 - 62:32)
limbo of getting the EV lutions so I (62:29 - 62:34)
needed to like get my Sylveon up really (62:32 - 62:36)
quickly before before go Fest before go (62:34 - 62:39)
Fest so I was like yeah buy some Poppins (62:36 - 62:42)
and just shove it in that mouth eat it (62:39 - 62:45)
love me and then uh I got to level 42 so (62:42 - 62:47)
it was all (62:45 - 62:50)
good even even with (62:47 - 62:55)
the terrible 44 to 45 Team Rocket thing (62:50 - 62:57)
I was like I&#39;m not giving you a penny (62:55 - 62:59)
Niantic I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to grind (62:57 - 63:01)
this out and then never do Team Rocket (62:59 - 63:03)
again once I&#39;m (63:01 - 63:06)
done oh actually um uh speaking of (63:03 - 63:08)
getting the shiny I think tonight I (63:06 - 63:10)
actually might get my shiny Mew after (63:08 - 63:11)
all this (63:10 - 63:14)
time I&#39;ve slacked so much I have slacked (63:11 - 63:17)
so much in this game so um if you&#39;re (63:14 - 63:20)
listening to this uh I probably already (63:17 - 63:23)
posted I got my shiny Mew so I&#39;m waiting (63:20 - 63:24)
to get a few more field research tasks (63:23 - 63:26)
done and then I should be good to go (63:24 - 63:29)
that&#39;s a 2021 that&#39;s a 2021 release hey (63:26 - 63:32)
it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a (63:29 - 63:32)
throwback wow uh all right let&#39;s let&#39;s (63:33 - 63:38)
take a break and then we&#39;ll do our last (63:36 - 63:41)
Za segment so we will be right (63:38 - 63:45)
back and we are back from our break uh (63:41 - 63:47)
final bit of news was actually this news (63:45 - 63:49)
broke (63:47 - 63:51)
today perfect timing because normally we (63:49 - 63:54)
record at like 11: in the morning but (63:51 - 63:56)
this broke at like 1 p.m. we&#39;re a little (63:54 - 64:02)
later today uh but uh Black Bolt and (63:56 - 64:06)
white flare and hot air Arena trademarks (64:02 - 64:08)
are filed for the Pokemon (64:06 - 64:13)
TCG which according to poke Beach also I (64:08 - 64:15)
tend to agree here this is evidence that (64:13 - 64:20)
Za will be a later release I also tend (64:15 - 64:22)
to (64:20 - 64:22)
agree so uh I don&#39;t think this means (64:23 - 64:27)
that we&#39;re getting black and white (64:26 - 64:33)
remakes for for no no no oh shattered oh (64:27 - 64:37)
no um I I think for sure we&#39;re probably (64:33 - 64:38)
getting (64:37 - 64:41)
Za you know next year uh and that&#39;s kind (64:38 - 64:44)
of it uh so this isn&#39;t like a a a leak (64:41 - 64:47)
or a rumor these are trademarks you can (64:44 - 64:50)
actually look up so again the trademarks (64:47 - 64:52)
are specifically Black (64:50 - 64:56)
Bolt comma white flare comma and then (64:52 - 65:00)
hot air Arena now these are Japanese (64:56 - 65:03)
trademarks so just like shrouded Fable (65:00 - 65:05)
is not called shrouded Fable in Japan I (65:03 - 65:08)
don&#39;t remember what set that was called (65:05 - 65:12)
in Japan but night wander night (65:08 - 65:16)
wander when when these TCG sets come to (65:12 - 65:19)
America they will not be called that so (65:16 - 65:20)
that again that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying this (65:19 - 65:22)
does not confirm black and white remakes (65:20 - 65:23)
it&#39;s not (65:22 - 65:26)
like it&#39;s not like brilliant diamond (65:23 - 65:28)
shining Pearl Black Bolt white flare cuz (65:26 - 65:32)
these names will be changed in the US (65:28 - 65:33)
but they yeah and they will probably be (65:32 - 65:37)
combined right so with Japanese sets (65:33 - 65:38)
like you could see like Black Bolt and (65:37 - 65:40)
white flare would be combined to make (65:38 - 65:42)
one set in English even though it&#39;s you (65:40 - 65:45)
know two sets in Japanese and that one (65:42 - 65:48)
set in English will have probably the (65:45 - 65:52)
ends raram in it which is the and that (65:48 - 65:54)
one set in English will be Pokemon Black (65:52 - 65:58)
and White remakes (65:54 - 65:58)
so if we are so so like how does this (66:00 - 66:05)
have to do with Za why does this mean (66:03 - 66:08)
zaa was later uh it has to do what we&#39;ve (66:05 - 66:09)
talked about for the last couple weeks (66:08 - 66:13)
is that Pokemon has this machine that (66:09 - 66:15)
they kind of have to follow because the (66:13 - 66:18)
anime has to follow it the TCG has to (66:15 - 66:20)
follow it and while not everything comes (66:18 - 66:23)
out like right away like for example the (66:20 - 66:26)
Pala anime didn&#39;t start until what like (66:23 - 66:29)
February or spring um instead of like (66:26 - 66:32)
November there&#39;s still a system they (66:29 - 66:35)
have to follow TCG sets in Japan come (66:32 - 66:37)
out every month TCG sets in America come (66:35 - 66:39)
out every three months that&#39;s why they (66:37 - 66:42)
combine those sets so for the upcoming (66:39 - 66:46)
TCG schedule for Japan we have on (66:42 - 66:48)
September 13th is Paradise dragonia (66:46 - 66:51)
featuring dragon Pokemon this makes (66:48 - 66:53)
sense because this is the year of dragon (66:51 - 66:56)
and Pokemon Center us has been doing (66:53 - 66:58)

annual high class Pack set yes so which (68:18 - 68:27)
Bobby us this will be like and so this (68:24 - 68:30)
is kind of setting the stage here for (68:27 - 68:33)
probably the last set regard like with (68:30 - 68:35)
regards to scarlet and violet right so (68:33 - 68:39)
back in um (68:35 - 68:42)
2022 they had like varar Universe in (68:39 - 68:44)
Japan and that kind of kicked off like (68:42 - 68:48)
the varar stuff um and you know past (68:44 - 68:49)
years they&#39;ve had that where it&#39;s at the (68:48 - 68:50)
very end of the year it&#39;s kind of like (68:49 - 68:55)
the end of that um could be the end of (68:50 - 68:56)
that like um (68:55 - 68:58)
way of playing or like a new way of (68:56 - 69:01)
playing kind of so teral Festival is (68:58 - 69:04)
that for probably for scarlet and violet (69:01 - 69:06)
um plus it&#39;s an Eevee set so that&#39;s (69:04 - 69:08)
going to be incredibly popular uh so I (69:06 - 69:10)
would you know see that being its own (69:08 - 69:14)
set in English probably um shortly after (69:10 - 69:16)
fourth year in a row they&#39;ve just done (69:14 - 69:18)
an Eevee (69:16 - 69:25)
set it feels like it yeah yeah this yeah (69:18 - 69:25)
they&#39;re the money makers like you know (69:26 - 69:30)
people love the evolutions I remember I (69:28 - 69:32)
still like when Umbreon cards were still (69:30 - 69:34)
expensive uh like the English ones even (69:32 - 69:37)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s just they will eat those (69:34 - 69:39)
up easily yeah Umbreon cards are still (69:37 - 69:42)
expensive that&#39;s still most (69:39 - 69:45)
expensive Umbreon is always expensive (69:42 - 69:47)
almost always like just like Charizard (69:45 - 69:49)
is almost always expensive I (69:47 - 69:52)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what it is about I (69:49 - 69:54)
and I feel like those like that Circle (69:52 - 69:56)
of Charizard lovers and Umbreon is (69:54 - 69:58)
almost a complete circle like that that (69:56 - 70:01)
V diagram of those two I feel like it&#39;s (69:58 - 70:06)
so close uh January 24th will be battle (70:01 - 70:08)
Partners which is featuring The Return (70:06 - 70:10)
of owners Pokemon mechanic this is what (70:08 - 70:12)
we saw at Worlds this was like Lily&#39;s (70:10 - 70:15)
Clefairy marne&#39;s Grim snarl archus is (70:12 - 70:19)
archus like that will be (70:15 - 70:22)

YouTube video Feel free to like comment (70:31 - 70:37)
subscribe hit that like button comment (70:35 - 70:40)
down below when you think Legend Za is (70:37 - 70:41)
coming (70:40 - 70:43)
out uh (70:41 - 70:46)
anyways uh February 21st will be two (70:43 - 70:50)
decks named Starter Set ex Stevens (70:46 - 70:53)
Beldum and Metagross ex and then Starter (70:50 - 70:57)
Set ex Marne marne&#39;s mopa and Mar and (70:53 - 71:00)
grimnar ex so they did not show this in (70:57 - 71:03)
the trailer at Worlds but we&#39;re (71:00 - 71:05)
obviously getting a Stevens&#39;s Metagross (71:03 - 71:07)
and a Steven&#39;s Beldum and we&#39;re (71:05 - 71:09)
definitely getting we saw marne&#39;s Grim (71:07 - 71:12)
snarl obviously it was safe to assume (71:09 - 71:14)
she was getting moreco but this is (71:12 - 71:16)
confirming that she is getting a (71:14 - 71:21)
moreco um and then March is supposed to (71:16 - 71:22)
be this is where it starts getting a (71:21 - 71:24)
little blurry CU we don&#39;t have dates so (71:22 - 71:27)
we we&#39;re good up to February 21st then (71:24 - 71:29)
we somewhere in March we should get the (71:27 - 71:32)
glory of Team Rocket which will feature (71:29 - 71:37)
Rockets Mewtwo in April that should be (71:32 - 71:39)
Black Bolt and white (71:37 - 71:42)
flare and then according to Pokey Beach (71:39 - 71:44)
May is the month they&#39;ve been skipping (71:42 - 71:47)
they skipped May in 2024 they skipped (71:44 - 71:49)
May in 2023 (71:47 - 71:52)
so they will possibly skip here and then (71:49 - 71:54)
they&#39;re saying June will be hot air (71:52 - 71:57)
Arena so so if we&#39;re following (71:54 - 72:01)
this according to TCG cards and just TCG (71:57 - 72:03)
cards Legends would (72:01 - 72:07)
be maybe June or (72:03 - 72:10)
afterwards yeah if yeah if June it&#39;s (72:07 - 72:13)
possible that June could like it&#39;s (72:10 - 72:16)
possible May because it&#39;s possible June (72:13 - 72:18)
could have to do with Legend Za now it&#39;s (72:16 - 72:20)
like good good chance that Black Bolt (72:18 - 72:22)
and white flare don&#39;t that most likely (72:20 - 72:24)
has to do with probably has to do with (72:22 - 72:27)
Unova in some way NS raram and Z (72:24 - 72:28)
whatever they want to do there but it (72:27 - 72:31)
probably has to do with yova in some way (72:28 - 72:34)
um keep in mind sorry to interrupt you (72:31 - 72:36)
keep in mind like if you don&#39;t follow (72:34 - 72:40)
TCG they will pick just random themes (72:36 - 72:42)
and go not like completely random but (72:40 - 72:45)
like remember in sword and shield era (72:42 - 72:48)
where they did do a lot of like Gen 4 (72:45 - 72:51)
characters mhm just in a set or like a (72:48 - 72:53)
lot of gen 3 characters in a set so this (72:51 - 72:55)
is like not uncommon for them to be like (72:53 - 72:57)
we&#39;re just going to do a couple gen five (72:55 - 73:01)
characters in a set right right and I (72:57 - 73:03)
think the other thing to to point out (73:01 - 73:04)
here is (73:03 - 73:07)
that if they&#39;re doing (73:04 - 73:10)
this at some point when Legend Za is (73:07 - 73:12)
supposed to come out in (73:10 - 73:14)
2025 like they&#39;re probably not like just (73:12 - 73:16)
to solidify that like they&#39;re probably (73:14 - 73:18)
not doing black and white remakes in (73:16 - 73:21)
between Legend Za supposed to come out (73:18 - 73:23)
in 2025 so in the like few months in (73:21 - 73:25)
between that like in the month or two in (73:23 - 73:26)
between that they are probably not doing (73:25 - 73:29)
that and I hate that I just said that (73:26 - 73:31)
because they actually did do that with (73:29 - 73:33)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl and then (73:31 - 73:34)
had Legends AR has come out two months (73:33 - 73:38)
later but yeah they&#39;re probably not (73:34 - 73:41)
doing that I I really do think that uh (73:38 - 73:44)
we could see like a June or July release (73:41 - 73:46)
because again hot air Arena doesn&#39;t (73:44 - 73:48)
really tell us anything other than the (73:46 - 73:50)
thought could be like it&#39;s maybe related (73:48 - 73:53)
to like fire flying Pokemon which (73:50 - 73:57)
obviously the (73:53 - 73:57)
I think hot air arena is Anime (73:57 - 74:05)
focused I think that&#39;s the Airship that (74:01 - 74:08)
the rising Volt tacklers take and (74:05 - 74:10)
they&#39;re going to (74:08 - 74:14)
do they&#39;re going to do Freed&#39;s Charizard (74:10 - 74:17)
as a partner (74:14 - 74:20)
Pokemon that would make a lot of (74:17 - 74:23)
sense here&#39;s here&#39;s me thinking oh it&#39;s (74:20 - 74:25)
like a sky battle theme going on here (74:23 - 74:27)
but now that you mentioned that Steve it (74:25 - 74:30)
does actually line up with even how the (74:27 - 74:32)
anime is going as well yeah like how (74:30 - 74:34)
would you describe to somebody who (74:32 - 74:35)
hasn&#39;t watched the anime like how do you (74:34 - 74:37)
describe a hot air Arena and it&#39;s like (74:35 - 74:40)
that is Freed&#39;s ship it&#39;s a hot air (74:37 - 74:44)
arena there you go well that I think I (74:40 - 74:47)
yeah so that&#39;s why I&#39;m like I don&#39;t like (74:44 - 74:48)
you could you could speculate the (74:47 - 74:53)
earliest wec Za is June but June seems (74:48 - 74:54)
like we&#39;re going to focus on the anime (74:53 - 74:58)
here yeah which June would Al also be a (74:54 - 75:00)
good time for maybe like a stellar (74:58 - 75:03)
Rayquaza coming to scarlet and violet (75:00 - 75:07)
shiny black again I don&#39;t yeah because (75:03 - 75:10)
they they a small spoiler for the anime (75:07 - 75:12)
at least in Japan they have not done the (75:10 - 75:14)
Stellar Rayquaza battle they haven&#39;t (75:12 - 75:16)
even said that Rayquaza is Stellar yet (75:14 - 75:20)
but like it is like you see it you see (75:16 - 75:22)
it in the yeah you figure out in like (75:20 - 75:24)
the first three episodes of the English (75:22 - 75:26)
anime of like oh this thing for Stellar (75:24 - 75:28)
they&#39;re just not saying it&#39;s (75:26 - 75:31)
Stellar H going back to the going back (75:28 - 75:35)
to the legend Za stuff so you know I I I (75:31 - 75:36)
always looking at trends for like video (75:35 - 75:39)
game releasing and stuff like that has (75:36 - 75:41)
Pokemon ever even released games like (75:39 - 75:43)
around like the summer season I&#39;m trying (75:41 - 75:45)
to think of anything that it&#39;s either (75:43 - 75:46)
like toward the end of the year or the (75:45 - 75:49)
star of the year but I don&#39;t know if you (75:46 - 75:51)
ever had a more worldwide release for a (75:49 - 75:55)
game at that caliber in the summertime (75:51 - 75:57)
I&#39;m not saying that you know breaking (75:55 - 75:58)
tradition is not a bad thing I would (75:57 - 76:00)
love to see something like that happen (75:58 - 76:02)
but I don&#39;t know if that just ties into (76:00 - 76:04)
other releases and what that may mean (76:02 - 76:07)
for Za we we&#39;ve definitely well I mean (76:04 - 76:09)
like red and blue in the US got released (76:07 - 76:12)
in September Crystal got released in (76:09 - 76:14)
September I think as well or not (76:12 - 76:15)
September maybe it was August I feel (76:14 - 76:17)
like we just celebrated Crystal&#39;s (76:15 - 76:19)
anniversary or something like that we (76:17 - 76:24)
did black and white was released in May (76:19 - 76:26)
for the US (76:24 - 76:29)
H or was it a these things don&#39;t black (76:26 - 76:32)
and white we can&#39;t I&#39;m now I&#39;m getting (76:29 - 76:35)
too far in on the black stuff no the (76:32 - 76:37)
black the Black Bolt white flare is (76:35 - 76:39)
super easy to break down white flare is (76:37 - 76:42)
going to be the full art and with r Ram (76:39 - 76:43)
blackbolt is going to be the full art (76:42 - 76:46)
zeero and R Ram that&#39;s all it is that&#39;s (76:43 - 76:48)
all and they&#39;re going to merge it (76:46 - 76:49)
together in one set for (76:48 - 76:53)
us that&#39;s all it is I hope so like they (76:49 - 76:55)
I just scared myself with like the the (76:53 - 76:56)
fact that brilliant Diamond shining (76:55 - 76:58)
Pearl did come out 3 months before (76:56 - 76:59)
Legends (76:58 - 77:02)
arus that&#39;s (76:59 - 77:02)
all that was like that was like two (77:02 - 77:07)
companies working on it right like you (77:04 - 77:08)
you could say that Ila is working on (77:07 - 77:09)
black and white but when you say that (77:08 - 77:12)
then your head goes to isn&#39;t ilka didn&#39;t (77:09 - 77:13)
they rename (77:12 - 77:16)
it is no Ila is still called Ila right (77:13 - 77:17)
which one&#39;s the one that got renamed to (77:16 - 77:19)
like their collaboration and it&#39;s like (77:17 - 77:23)
Pokemon Studios oh yes yes that is the (77:19 - 77:26)
yes Ila and Pokemon have like a uh I (77:23 - 77:28)
don&#39;t remember what that was called but (77:26 - 77:31)
yes they have an official Studio (77:28 - 77:32)
together but I I think that&#39;s more like (77:31 - 77:36)
Pokemon home stuff than (77:32 - 77:39)
anything it is probably I think I think (77:36 - 77:44)
El in the Long Haul for that yeah no for (77:39 - 77:48)
sure uh (77:44 - 77:48)
uh yeah I I I think like n being the (77:49 - 77:55)
featured (77:53 - 77:59)
Pokemon triner card for that set makes (77:55 - 78:01)
the most like everyone lost their mind (77:59 - 78:03)
when n showed up because people like n (78:01 - 78:06)
do you think though that they it&#39;s just (78:03 - 78:10)
and it&#39;s it&#39;s very possible but it would (78:06 - 78:12)
be weird to me that they showed a card (78:10 - 78:14)
off so far in advance of when it&#39;s (78:12 - 78:17)
coming out like I assume that NS reram (78:14 - 78:18)
and all of that was going to be a part (78:17 - 78:21)
of whatever this new like battle partner (78:18 - 78:23)
set is in January like for them to show (78:21 - 78:24)
that card off and the set doesn&#39;t come (78:23 - 78:26)
out till like April or May because they (78:24 - 78:28)
showed the English version it was a full (78:26 - 78:29)
English version of the card yeah of the (78:28 - 78:31)
card and they and I do I&#39;m looking at it (78:29 - 78:32)
right now I do see that they don&#39;t have (78:31 - 78:34)
the little like obviously they don&#39;t (78:32 - 78:36)
have the little code like the little um (78:34 - 78:38)
abbreviation at the bottom or anything (78:36 - 78:40)
or a set number or anything like that (78:38 - 78:42)
it&#39;s just the the card but it&#39;s like the (78:40 - 78:46)
full English version of the card um and (78:42 - 78:49)
a 2025 copyright which yeah makes sense (78:46 - 78:51)
next year next year I want to remind you (78:49 - 78:53)
they showed a game in February that we (78:51 - 78:57)
haven&#39;t heard from (78:53 - 78:57)
that&#39;s true that&#39;s true I (78:58 - 79:02)
um we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have Hard dates for (79:02 - 79:09)
March April May June right it&#39;s possible (79:06 - 79:11)
that blackbolt white flare comes before (79:09 - 79:14)
the glory of Team Rocket I don&#39;t know (79:11 - 79:15)
why poke Beach is listing Glory of Team (79:14 - 79:17)
Rocket before just because that (79:15 - 79:20)
trademark had been out um prior oh the (79:17 - 79:22)
trademark existed before the trademark (79:20 - 79:23)
for this yeah for Glory of Team Rocket (79:22 - 79:27)
existed a few months ago CU I I would I (79:23 - 79:30)
would assume that it would be Black Bolt (79:27 - 79:32)
white flare because of n before Team (79:30 - 79:34)
Rocket because in the English trailer (79:32 - 79:37)
the Team Rocket was slightly hinted at (79:34 - 79:38)
at the very very end they just like (79:37 - 79:41)
flashed the rocket logo right well (79:38 - 79:42)
that&#39;s why I would think it&#39;s the one (79:41 - 79:43)
that&#39;s it&#39;s the one that follows the (79:42 - 79:46)
trainer like right it&#39;d be trainer (79:43 - 79:48)
battle partners and then the rocket set (79:46 - 79:51)
would be next it&#39;s like leading into the (79:48 - 79:52)
next set (79:51 - 79:55)
after battle Partners yeah so that&#39;s I (79:52 - 79:57)
feel like the rocket one would be first (79:55 - 79:58)
before and that&#39;s what I was trying to (79:57 - 80:00)
say not last week but maybe the week (79:58 - 80:04)
before is like I don&#39;t think n (80:00 - 80:07)
Marne Ethan I can&#39;t remember who else (80:04 - 80:09)
they showed um like I can&#39;t imagine (80:07 - 80:12)
those are all just like the trainers (80:09 - 80:14)
like they have to have a bunch they (80:12 - 80:16)
didn&#39;t show like Misty (80:14 - 80:20)
Erica yeah the again freed I think freed (80:16 - 80:22)
will be a like freed and Charizard like (80:20 - 80:24)
no way don&#39;t they they don&#39;t do freed (80:22 - 80:27)
and Charizard or Leo and (80:24 - 80:30)
masara don&#39;t no spoilers I don&#39;t know if (80:27 - 80:31)
she has masara I&#39;m just thinking final (80:30 - 80:35)
evolution but um Roy F Coco right like I (80:31 - 80:39)
think they will do something like that I (80:35 - 80:41)
I am interested in like how this will (80:39 - 80:44)
break down into English sets cuz I will (80:41 - 80:46)
say like terral Festival I&#39;m going to (80:44 - 80:49)
guess in December will end up being its (80:46 - 80:51)
own set in English as well kind of like (80:49 - 80:54)
V Universe became Crown Zenith in (80:51 - 80:56)
English what was the one before that (80:54 - 80:58)
like Champions path I think was also a (80:56 - 81:00)
special set yeah Champions path was was (80:58 - 81:03)
a special set um but yeah Crown Zenith (81:00 - 81:05)
was like the end of sword and shield so (81:03 - 81:07)
that that was literally the last set of (81:05 - 81:08)
sword and shield and it had all the (81:07 - 81:10)
trainer Gallery cards and all that or (81:08 - 81:12)
the gallerian gallery cards that was (81:10 - 81:16)
varar Universe I believe so this (81:12 - 81:17)
terrestrial Festival I would guess that (81:16 - 81:19)
that&#39;s going to be like its own English (81:17 - 81:22)
set that&#39;s a special set then in January (81:19 - 81:24)
though then I I&#39;m wondering how they (81:22 - 81:25)
break that down (81:24 - 81:28)
battle partners and Glory of Team Rocket (81:25 - 81:30)
does that actually become like one set (81:28 - 81:31)
in English because we&#39;re talking (81:30 - 81:33)
Japanese sets here and you know there&#39;s (81:31 - 81:35)
smaller sets in Japanese so it&#39;s like I (81:33 - 81:37)
don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to do like (81:35 - 81:40)
three sets on their own in a row in (81:37 - 81:42)
English so the question becomes like (81:40 - 81:44)
where do these sets start to combine (81:42 - 81:46)
like is it Glory of Team Rocket and (81:44 - 81:47)
black bold and white flare are all (81:46 - 81:49)
actually one set in English that&#39;s what (81:47 - 81:50)
you&#39;re saying is it battle Partners in (81:49 - 81:52)
glory of Team Rocket is actually one set (81:50 - 81:54)
in English like we don&#39;t know where that (81:52 - 81:57)
combination happens um and if they&#39;re (81:54 - 81:59)
coming out with trash drill Festival in (81:57 - 82:03)
December in uh in Japan that typically (81:59 - 82:05)
means probably about a January a late (82:03 - 82:07)
January release in English and then (82:05 - 82:10)
about a March release for the next set (82:07 - 82:12)
in English so I could see battle (82:10 - 82:13)
Partners in glory of Team Rocket almost (82:12 - 82:16)
being like one set together in (82:13 - 82:19)
English you know that I could see them (82:16 - 82:20)
actually putting it together they could (82:19 - 82:24)
also not skip may this year that too and (82:20 - 82:28)
have another set yeah (82:24 - 82:31)
but definitely none of these sets are Za (82:28 - 82:33)
definitely not NOP they are all (82:31 - 82:35)
definitely uh I think none of them are (82:33 - 82:36)
scarlet and violet either right I think (82:35 - 82:38)
they&#39;re ending that with trash show (82:36 - 82:40)
festival and now we&#39;re just getting (82:38 - 82:43)
special or like different types of sets (82:40 - 82:45)
that are calling back to older (82:43 - 82:47)
Generations you know trainers and you (82:45 - 82:50)
know Team Rocket and then down the line (82:47 - 82:53)
we&#39;re going to get Legend Za in you (82:50 - 82:56)
maybe maybe July August September frame (82:53 - 82:59)
time frame who knows yeah the the real (82:56 - 83:01)
question I have is for TCG players is (82:59 - 83:04)
are they going to re-release n as a card (83:01 - 83:07)
just n as a supporter card which was (83:04 - 83:10)
huge right it was it was like four in (83:07 - 83:12)
every deck it was shuffle your hand you (83:10 - 83:14)
and your opponent shuffle your hands (83:12 - 83:15)
into your deck and draw to how many (83:14 - 83:18)
prize cards you have so if they have one (83:15 - 83:19)
prize left and you have six and you&#39;re (83:18 - 83:21)
losing that was literally a comeback (83:19 - 83:23)
card cuz you&#39;re drawing six now and (83:21 - 83:26)
they&#39;re drawing one it was so good oh (83:23 - 83:29)
yeah um and the the thing with the TCG (83:26 - 83:32)
is they eventually redo all the cards (83:29 - 83:34)
again like everything comes full circle (83:32 - 83:36)
in the TCG yeah uh like they got rid of (83:34 - 83:38)
Ultra Ball for what like six months and (83:36 - 83:41)
they were like Ultra Ball&#39;s bad (83:38 - 83:41)
yeah like great ball has been the same (83:43 - 83:48)
since however long I&#39;ve ever remembered (83:45 - 83:49)
it and there&#39;s been sets where like oh (83:48 - 83:51)
great ball doesn&#39;t exist anymore it&#39;ll (83:49 - 83:54)
it&#39;ll come back so I wonder and that can (83:51 - 83:58)
be like another thing of why maybe these (83:54 - 83:59)
sets (83:58 - 84:02)
are Black Bolt white flar is cuz like (83:59 - 84:05)
not only is n (84:02 - 84:08)
featured because like Russ ran ZR cards (84:05 - 84:10)
always do pretty well but like n as a (84:08 - 84:12)
supporter card would come back and that (84:10 - 84:16)
would be very valuable to players well (84:12 - 84:17)
there might be some players that are (84:16 - 84:20)
like I hate it (84:17 - 84:25)
but the PTSD comat is now oh here we go (84:20 - 84:27)
don&#39;t bring back hypnotoxic laser please (84:25 - 84:30)
that (84:27 - 84:30)
was yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think (84:30 - 84:34)
at all this is like Gen 5 confirmed or (84:32 - 84:36)
we should be seeing anything Gen 5 I I (84:34 - 84:38)
think for sure it will be Legends next (84:36 - 84:42)
year and then gen 10 the year after and (84:38 - 84:45)
then yeah which which I think is really (84:42 - 84:48)
good pacing like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had so many (84:45 - 84:51)
game releases in in the time of doing (84:48 - 84:53)
this podcast for 10 plus years where it (84:51 - 84:55)
just feels like I wish they took a (84:53 - 84:58)
little more time I wish this game was a (84:55 - 85:00)
little more polished I&#39;m okay with (84:58 - 85:02)
waiting a couple extra (85:00 - 85:05)
months and so if all we get next year is (85:02 - 85:07)
Za and then the year after we get gen 10 (85:05 - 85:08)
and then the year after that we get (85:07 - 85:12)
black and white or uh let&#39;s go Octillery (85:08 - 85:16)
let&#39;s go remade um (85:12 - 85:21)
that&#39;s I&#39;m like I&#39;m okay I I am I am (85:16 - 85:25)
totally okay with any type of delays cuz (85:21 - 85:27)
I know we felt that burnout between (85:25 - 85:29)
scarlet and violet and legends like just (85:27 - 85:31)
like that timeline in between I I felt (85:29 - 85:34)
it too like it was bdsp Legends and (85:31 - 85:38)
right all those all those together um so (85:34 - 85:41)
I do like the idea of yes let&#39;s make (85:38 - 85:45)
2025 really like you know Legend CA Za (85:41 - 85:48)
and then we know that you know what you (85:45 - 85:50)
said earlier Steve where you know (85:48 - 85:52)
Pokemon company has these schedules they (85:50 - 85:52)
want to make sure things are kind of (85:52 - 85:54)
like in sync with one another we know (85:52 - 85:56)
they&#39;re not afraid of starting an anime (85:54 - 85:59)
too late in the process so you know who (85:56 - 86:00)
knows how much anime is left of the (85:59 - 86:02)
current scarland of violence generation (86:00 - 86:04)
it may end before like it may go into (86:02 - 86:08)
even gen 10 in 2026 possibly um so those (86:04 - 86:10)
are things just to you know look out for (86:08 - 86:11)
when you look at the anime schedule (86:10 - 86:13)
because that that can give you some (86:11 - 86:15)
hints possibly maybe a couple months (86:13 - 86:17)
here and there but yeah I&#39;m totally fine (86:15 - 86:20)
if the only game we got next year Za and (86:17 - 86:22)
then make it good make it good work on (86:20 - 86:25)
it really well and then focus on gen 10 (86:22 - 86:27)
strong for like 2026 I think that would (86:25 - 86:30)
be a good timeline yeah and I think (86:27 - 86:33)
scarland violets has has life in it (86:30 - 86:34)
whether or not people want to accept (86:33 - 86:36)
that and or you&#39;ve already written it (86:34 - 86:37)
off because you don&#39;t like the frame (86:36 - 86:39)
rate or whatever personal reason like (86:37 - 86:40)
that&#39;s totally I understand if you don&#39;t (86:39 - 86:42)
like scar I get it but that doesn&#39;t mean (86:40 - 86:44)
that they don&#39;t have a bunch of huian (86:42 - 86:46)
Pokemon to put in outbreaks other (86:44 - 86:49)
outbreaks to do other Seven Stars to do (86:46 - 86:52)
like reg regulation H started today and (86:49 - 86:55)
people are so excited about regulation H (86:52 - 86:56)
and that&#39;s going to run for three months (86:55 - 86:57)
and then (86:56 - 87:02)
regulation e f g i will happen (86:57 - 87:04)
afterwards which will be its own set of (87:02 - 87:06)
rules and then as we get closer to next (87:04 - 87:08)
year&#39;s worlds it will be regulation (87:06 - 87:11)
whatever letter which will be two (87:08 - 87:13)
restricted Pokemon because this year&#39;s (87:11 - 87:16)
worlds was one restricted Pokemon so (87:13 - 87:19)
we&#39;re still on we&#39;re still on that (87:16 - 87:23)
predictable schedule I guess yeah but (87:19 - 87:27)
the TC following TCG sets like Bobby (87:23 - 87:30)
argued two two weeks ago is correct like (87:27 - 87:34)
the TCG is probably closest to the games (87:30 - 87:36)
than anything yeah schedule (87:34 - 87:39)
wise not not toys not the anime because (87:36 - 87:40)
the anime is kind (87:39 - 87:44)
of has a it&#39;s a little off but like TCG (87:40 - 87:47)
is pretty spoton with with games yeah (87:44 - 87:50)
almost almost always I mean like even (87:47 - 87:52)
you have to you think about like cuz all (87:50 - 87:54)
the push back that happened I mean when (87:52 - 87:55)
I say push back I mean like things (87:54 - 87:58)
getting pushed back um happening with (87:55 - 88:01)
like um Co or whatever it was but you (87:58 - 88:03)
know you think about like when Legends (88:01 - 88:05)
archus came out well varar Universe (88:03 - 88:09)
varar was in regards to uh legends (88:05 - 88:12)
archus that was like a thing that had to (88:09 - 88:14)
do with Legends archus and that came out (88:12 - 88:16)
like a month before the game came out (88:14 - 88:18)
and even like when a new set comes out (88:16 - 88:20)
for a new generation right so like you (88:18 - 88:22)
have Scarlet Violet came out and then (88:20 - 88:23)
like 3 months later the Scarlet Violet (88:22 - 88:25)
Bas set came out out that happened with (88:23 - 88:26)
sword and shield as well it&#39;s like three (88:25 - 88:28)
months later sword and shield Bas set (88:26 - 88:29)
come out like they&#39;re a spot they&#39;re (88:28 - 88:33)
pretty spot-on and so it&#39;s like you&#39;ll (88:29 - 88:36)
kind of see and I it is it&#39;ll be (88:33 - 88:38)
interesting to see if they do if the (88:36 - 88:41)
trademark set kind of gives away that (88:38 - 88:42)
it&#39;s like a legend Za thing I don&#39;t know (88:41 - 88:44)
how they&#39; do that if it&#39;s becomes very (88:42 - 88:47)
Kaos like heavy in some way or you know (88:44 - 88:50)
has you know star some Pokemon that&#39;s in (88:47 - 88:53)
Kaos um but I feel like you&#39;ll kind of (88:50 - 88:55)
see it there if the if the trademark (88:53 - 88:57)
does you know give anything away but (88:55 - 88:59)
based on everything we saw so far I hate (88:57 - 89:01)
to say it because I was saying a month (88:59 - 89:05)
ago like it&#39;s going to be early 2025 but (89:01 - 89:07)
now looking at all this stuff I don&#39;t (89:05 - 89:09)
think so I think we&#39;re looking at like (89:07 - 89:11)
mid to late 2025 also one one thing I (89:09 - 89:13)
was thinking about too um looking back (89:11 - 89:15)
at Worlds this year when they announced (89:13 - 89:17)
like the next two years of like the (89:15 - 89:19)
worlds being held it has that same you (89:17 - 89:21)
know like looking at like the graphics (89:19 - 89:23)
and the logos it&#39;s the same theme I I (89:21 - 89:25)
know I&#39;m not maybe reading too much into (89:23 - 89:27)
it but I really do think the next two (89:25 - 89:28)
worlds will still use scarlet and violet (89:27 - 89:31)
as like the main WGC you know backdrops (89:28 - 89:35)
or um possibly so I&#39;m thinking yes in (89:31 - 89:37)
California you wrap up uh the next two (89:35 - 89:39)
years with um BGC using the Scarlet (89:37 - 89:41)
Violet maybe you have some Pokemon (89:39 - 89:45)
Legend Za uh um compatibility maybe some (89:41 - 89:47)
crossovers happening and then later in (89:45 - 89:49)
2025 that&#39;s when you start to go into (89:47 - 89:52)
the Gen 10 Direction uh for some games (89:49 - 89:53)
again I&#39;m not trying to look too deep (89:52 - 89:55)
into it but (89:53 - 89:56)
that&#39;s that&#39;s how I look at it as well (89:55 - 89:58)
especially with everything else going on (89:56 - 90:00)
with TCG like you mentioned about yeah (89:58 - 90:02)
yeah my my (90:00 - 90:04)
only thought process which (90:02 - 90:07)
is yeah it&#39;s hard for anyone to (90:04 - 90:09)
speculate or guess it&#39;s just throwing (90:07 - 90:11)
throwing darts at a at a board and (90:09 - 90:14)
hoping that you get something right but (90:11 - 90:18)
like if like Legends shouldn&#39;t be a VGC (90:14 - 90:21)
game no at all right and we know that (90:18 - 90:23)
like next year&#39;s World will for sure be (90:21 - 90:25)
too restricted Scarlet Violet so we we (90:23 - 90:27)
know that for sure so it doesn&#39;t matter (90:25 - 90:29)
when Legends comes out next year cuz it (90:27 - 90:32)
wouldn&#39;t be the VGC game anyways Scarlet (90:29 - 90:34)
Violet would still be but if it let&#39;s (90:32 - 90:37)
just say Legends comes out in (90:34 - 90:41)
June that still opens up the possibility (90:37 - 90:45)
for a gen 10 to come out in the spring (90:41 - 90:46)
which is before (90:45 - 90:52)
worlds uh and that would be or or um if (90:46 - 90:54)
it does come out and fall then you are (90:52 - 90:56)
stuck with scarlet and violet for (90:54 - 90:59)
another worlds which I don&#39;t think they (90:56 - 91:01)
would want to do but like if they have (90:59 - 91:03)
to do it they&#39;re going to do it (91:01 - 91:06)
right like let&#39;s go Pikachu let&#39;s go (91:03 - 91:09)
Eevee was out fully and they stuck with (91:06 - 91:11)
sun and moon which was like yeah Ultron (91:09 - 91:15)
Ultra mood but like right well okay so (91:11 - 91:17)
how many worlds did they have that were (91:15 - 91:18)
sword and (91:17 - 91:22)
shield uh based they had three because (91:18 - 91:24)
right because Legends and then scarlet (91:22 - 91:25)
and violet didn&#39;t come out till the (91:24 - 91:27)
following November so that world that (91:25 - 91:32)
was 2022 was still sword and shield uh (91:27 - 91:36)
and then 2023 2024 2025 would be Scarlet (91:32 - 91:38)
Violet I mean if you even if you go back (91:36 - 91:41)
to black and white releasing in gosh I (91:38 - 91:43)
wish I it&#39;s either April or May in the (91:41 - 91:46)
US that was the first like worlds was (91:43 - 91:48)
black and white all you could use all (91:46 - 91:49)
you could use was black and white (91:48 - 91:51)
Pokemon no legendaries there was no (91:49 - 91:53)
landeras at the time there was no tornad (91:51 - 91:55)
Thundurus was (91:53 - 91:58)
just Cel kelder (91:55 - 92:02)
runas uh (91:58 - 92:04)
uh the The Mummy Pokemon I can&#39;t (92:02 - 92:07)
remember its name cofagrigas um like (92:04 - 92:09)
those were the Pokemon being used in (92:07 - 92:11)
those battles that was like 2011 I think (92:09 - 92:13)
uh yeah because black and white came out (92:11 - 92:14)
September of (92:13 - 92:19)
2010 yeah so then 2011&#39;s worlds yeah (92:14 - 92:20)
would have been black and white well (92:19 - 92:22)
September 2010 for (92:20 - 92:25)
Japan no oh sorry you&#39;re right you&#39;re (92:22 - 92:29)
right it was March it was March of 2011 (92:25 - 92:33)
March of 2011 for America and Australia (92:29 - 92:36)
yeah so and then that went into that (92:33 - 92:39)
world so and Europe sorry and Europe too (92:36 - 92:41)
and your classic Europe I can&#39;t I can&#39;t (92:39 - 92:43)
forget (92:41 - 92:43)
Europe I I&#39;ve always said it on the show (92:44 - 92:47)
I think I think there there are (92:46 - 92:50)
definitely patterns in Pokemon for sure (92:47 - 92:53)
but the one pattern that Pokemon has (92:50 - 92:56)
been really good at is breaking all of (92:53 - 92:57)
those patterns like we never got a (92:56 - 93:00)
Pokemon Gray we never got a Pokemon Z we (92:57 - 93:02)
got let&#39;s go out of nowhere we got (93:00 - 93:05)
Legends archus out of (93:02 - 93:09)
nowhere um we got Legends archus in (93:05 - 93:13)
January of all months like like to say (93:09 - 93:15)
that like gen 10 has to come out in (93:13 - 93:19)
November or uh Legend Za has to come out (93:15 - 93:21)
in just January just because the other (93:19 - 93:24)
one came out in January is just (93:21 - 93:26)
do do we all just forget about Pokemon (93:24 - 93:29)
Gray like that that that on this podcast (93:26 - 93:31)
I&#39;m sure I talked about it 14 years ago (93:29 - 93:33)
of like oh Pokemon Gray is gonna be next (93:31 - 93:35)
and then it it and that was trademarked (93:33 - 93:36)
it was trademarked we talked about it on (93:35 - 93:39)
the show that Pokemon gray.com was (93:36 - 93:42)
trademarked um and they never used that (93:39 - 93:44)
trademark they trademarked it to (93:42 - 93:46)
trademark it and they didn&#39;t end up (93:44 - 93:48)
using it uh (93:46 - 93:52)

a little validity to it (93:52 - 93:57)
um even if it doesn&#39;t line up with Za (93:54 - 93:58)
