the right of the chair and a hand themed (4:24 - 4:31)
custom stitching throughout (4:28 - 4:32)
it (4:31 - 4:36)
does not say how much they go for (4:32 - 4:38)
they're expensive (4:36 - 4:41)
secret labs chairs are yeah kind of (4:38 - 4:44)
pricey they are very good chairs (4:41 - 4:47)
here's the thing um (4:44 - 4:49)
i don't know if they're good but when (4:47 - 4:53)
they started they were not (4:49 - 4:55)
because i remember when secret labs (4:53 - 4:57)
started and if you their their website's (4:55 - 4:58)
very different than what it was and they (4:57 - 5:01)
would show like why their chair was (4:58 - 5:02)
different (5:01 - 5:04)
and they would show the uh exca the (5:02 - 5:06)
skeleton of their chair (5:04 - 5:08)
and their chair is like the same (5:06 - 5:11)
skeleton of (5:08 - 5:12)
40 other (5:11 - 5:16)
chairs that you can manufacture in china (5:12 - 5:18)
and (5:16 - 5:20)
i mean that's a lot of things in life (5:18 - 5:21)
right (5:20 - 5:23)
there's a lot of overlapping good design (5:21 - 5:25)
sure their their website says there's (5:23 - 5:29)
the best gaming chairs so i don't have (5:25 - 5:31)
a reason to deny that that's true why (5:29 - 5:33)
would you lie about that why i mean why (5:31 - 5:35)
would you say anything okay so i'm (5:33 - 5:38)
looking at secret labs titan evo 2022 (5:35 - 5:39)
series (5:38 - 5:43)
cyberpunk chair (5:39 - 5:43)
and the (5:43 - 5:47)
sale price because it is on sale right (5:44 - 5:48)
now (5:47 - 5:51)
they're always on sale (5:48 - 5:51)
they're always for sale but they're not (5:52 - 5:57)
necessarily always on sale well no no no (5:54 - 5:59)
secret lab will always have a sale on (5:57 - 6:01)
something not necessarily the one you (5:59 - 6:04)
want right but they always have a sale (6:01 - 6:04)
mid-month is (6:05 - 6:11)
4.99 (6:08 - 6:14)
yeah sounds about right (6:11 - 6:14)
that's what i paid for my racer so (6:14 - 6:18)
why do you need to lean this far back in (6:20 - 6:24)
a chair oh i nap in my chair all the (6:22 - 6:25)
time that's why i got this built-in (6:24 - 6:28)
pillow there's a (6:25 - 6:30)
i live in my house no no no no no no no (6:28 - 6:33)
if you nap in a bed that's commitment if (6:30 - 6:34)

i saved my money from (8:15 - 8:20)
after after a whole year on twitch i i (8:17 - 8:21)
was sitting in like a (8:20 - 8:23)
129 (8:21 - 8:24)
office depot chair (8:23 - 8:26)
had this chair for like eight years it (8:24 - 8:27)
was great (8:26 - 8:29)
until you sit in it (8:27 - 8:32)
for eight hours of streaming not so (8:29 - 8:33)
great anymore when i was sitting in it (8:32 - 8:35)
for a two hour podcast (8:33 - 8:37)
wonderful (8:35 - 8:40)
insert professor oak wonderful (8:37 - 8:42)
and i thought the entire time i was (8:40 - 8:43)
sitting in this chair i was like i need (8:42 - 8:45)
a head rest this is the problem with the (8:43 - 8:48)
chair spoiler it wasn't the headrest was (8:45 - 8:50)
not the problem (8:48 - 8:52)
so i got um (8:50 - 8:55)
so first i got a steel series chair (8:52 - 8:57)
which was (8:55 - 8:59)
also very expensive very similar to a (8:57 - 9:02)
herman miller and i sat in the series i (8:59 - 9:04)
had the steel series chair for like a (9:02 - 9:05)
week (9:04 - 9:07)
and it destroyed my back this is like a (9:05 - 9:11)
1500 chair i i saved up for it waited (9:07 - 9:13)
for it to go on sale all these all these (9:11 - 9:15)
chairs go on sale a couple times a year (9:13 - 9:17)
got it (9:15 - 9:20)
i hated it from the second i did all the (9:17 - 9:22)
adjustments that had the built-in knobs (9:20 - 9:23)
and stuff i emailed them i was like i (9:22 - 9:25)
don't know what i'm doing how am i (9:23 - 9:26)
sitting in this chair wrong yeah and (9:25 - 9:28)
they were like they're like (9:26 - 9:30)
sometimes (9:28 - 9:31)
it just doesn't work with your body you (9:30 - 9:32)
should send it back i was like okay and (9:31 - 9:34)
then i went to the herman miller store (9:32 - 9:35)
down in milwaukee (9:34 - 9:37)
and i sat in a bunch of herman miller's (9:35 - 9:38)
and i was like okay these are these are (9:37 - 9:39)
comfortable and then i was like all (9:38 - 9:42)
right come back sat at him again (9:39 - 9:43)
and then finally i was like all right (9:42 - 9:46)
let's let's order the herman miller (9:43 - 9:48)
oh same thing just (9:46 - 9:49)
once it was in my house i was like i (9:48 - 9:51)
hate this (9:49 - 9:52)
you know the thing about the hermann (9:51 - 9:54)
miller why i don't think it worked for (9:52 - 9:56)
me because i'm tiny (9:54 - 9:57)
yeah (9:56 - 10:00)
and they have the like (9:57 - 10:01)
mesh (10:00 - 10:02)
yes it was more of a mesh chair and i (10:01 - 10:05)
feel like i didn't push down on the mesh (10:02 - 10:08)
to make it like so that what you're (10:05 - 10:09)
saying is you need to do more squats and (10:08 - 10:11)
deadlifts yeah need to get out there and (10:09 - 10:14)
clang and bang yeah work on the booty (10:11 - 10:16)
because i purchased (10:14 - 10:17)
my husband to herman miller when he (10:16 - 10:20)
started working from home as a big (10:17 - 10:24)
birthday gift and he has had it now (10:20 - 10:24)
10 (10:26 - 10:30)
10 years (10:28 - 10:31)
maybe 12. (10:30 - 10:33)
uh and he loves it it's been the (10:31 - 10:35)
greatest it was (10:33 - 10:36)
of all the things that i bought him that (10:35 - 10:38)
he never uses because i will buy him (10:36 - 10:40)
things that he says he wants and he's (10:38 - 10:41)
like great and then it sits in the (10:40 - 10:43)
corner and does nothing and then i'm (10:41 - 10:45)
like i hate you (10:43 - 10:47)
he uh (10:45 - 10:49)
well obviously he uses this constantly (10:47 - 10:52)
and now he's like oh the arm pads are (10:49 - 10:53)
wearing out so i'm gonna have to contact (10:52 - 10:54)
them for my lifetime (10:53 - 10:57)
replacement parts to get my arm pads (10:54 - 10:59)
uh replaced but it's like the best (10:57 - 11:01)
purchase i've ever made i also at one (10:59 - 11:03)
point but you remember um (11:01 - 11:05)
the paraffin wax (11:03 - 11:07)
uh bath where you could put your hands (11:05 - 11:10)
in so yeah yeah yeah that's sitting in (11:07 - 11:14)
the cupboard of our kitchen used twice (11:10 - 11:17)
what my in my adventure of chair (11:14 - 11:19)
shopping so i ended up on the han (11:17 - 11:20)
which the han is like an eight hundred (11:19 - 11:22)
dollar chair well what's wrong behind (11:20 - 11:24)
you what are you what are you on oh this (11:22 - 11:27)
is uh this i did i did for our youtube (11:24 - 11:30)
people i did a mario party stream with (11:27 - 11:32)
my wife this is just her chair (11:30 - 11:35)
yeah this is the same chair will has yes (11:32 - 11:37)
i don't remember the brand technique (11:35 - 11:38)
technique technique (11:37 - 11:39)
um (11:38 - 11:41)
which i i did have this chair and it was (11:39 - 11:42)
okay this is the chair i thought i (11:41 - 11:44)
needed the headrest for did what was it (11:42 - 11:46)
but you don't nap enough in your chair (11:44 - 11:48)
that's the problem i don't i don't so i (11:46 - 11:51)
the han which is like an 800 chair (11:48 - 11:53)
never even heard of it but here's here's (11:51 - 11:55)
the pro tip (11:53 - 11:57)
never buy (11:55 - 11:59)
these chairs full price (11:57 - 12:01)
you can go to this is what i discovered (11:59 - 12:03)
if you just google search (12:01 - 12:06)
um like office warehouse not like office (12:03 - 12:10)
depot like generic office warehouse (12:06 - 12:12)
there's a bunch especially because of (12:10 - 12:16)
the pandemic there's a bunch of office (12:12 - 12:18)
used office resellers (12:16 - 12:21)
and the one in milwaukee was a women (12:18 - 12:22)
woman-owned (12:21 - 12:24)
store and they were really great and you (12:22 - 12:27)
walk in and they have literally every (12:24 - 12:29)
chair we just talked about (12:27 - 12:31)
and you can just sit in them and the (12:29 - 12:33)
chair i'm sitting in it was again (12:31 - 12:37)
retailed for 700. it was 199. (12:33 - 12:41)
so let me they had herman miller's for (12:37 - 12:42)
like seven like literally half the price (12:41 - 12:44)
like 750 and they looked brand new (12:42 - 12:46)
because one of these companies will buy (12:44 - 12:48)
all these chairs (12:46 - 12:50)
let me let me simplify and explain this (12:48 - 12:52)
for our younger listeners this is how (12:50 - 12:55)
capitalism works first your employer (12:52 - 12:57)
tells you that you no longer have an (12:55 - 12:59)
office to come to and you need to work (12:57 - 13:01)
from your own home and pay for your own (12:59 - 13:03)
internet electricity and everything like (13:01 - 13:05)
that they then close down the office (13:03 - 13:08)
buildings they sell all of the furniture (13:05 - 13:10)
that you used to sit on that they (13:08 - 13:12)
provided you to a (13:10 - 13:17)
warehouse which you then buy the chair (13:12 - 13:22)
that your employer used to provide you (13:17 - 13:24)
from that warehouse you have now given (13:22 - 13:27)
money technically in a way back to your (13:24 - 13:30)
employer so that you don't have to come (13:27 - 13:33)
to their office any longer welcome to (13:30 - 13:35)
capitalism kids (13:33 - 13:37)
so two things one (13:35 - 13:41)
never buy a chair you have not sat in (13:37 - 13:42)
true true (13:41 - 13:44)
number two (13:42 - 13:47)
look for an office reseller (13:44 - 13:49)
i mean i purchased the chair that i'm in (13:47 - 13:51)
that and i never sat in it and it's (13:49 - 13:52)
perfectly fine and about another but (13:51 - 13:54)
that was the second time you bought that (13:52 - 13:55)
chair right because you bought it again (13:54 - 13:58)
i i bought it again for the other office (13:55 - 13:59)
uh (13:58 - 14:01)
but when i had purchased this i had (13:59 - 14:03)
never sat in this chair before (14:01 - 14:05)
yeah i would have i would have never (14:03 - 14:08)
purchased that steel series chair (14:05 - 14:10)
i would say obviously liquidators is the (14:08 - 14:12)
big one in uh (14:10 - 14:15)
minnesota minnesota yeah (14:12 - 14:17)
i don't remember what the one in (14:15 - 14:18)
milwaukee was it was very generic it was (14:17 - 14:20)
like i remember hearing a lot of office (14:18 - 14:21)
liquidator commercials back in the 80s (14:20 - 14:24)
and 90s (14:21 - 14:24)
out in brooklyn (14:26 - 14:28)
park uh (14:29 - 14:34)
this news isn't on the english pokemon (14:31 - 14:35)
website i'm sure it will be (14:34 - 14:37)
when they get back to i was gonna say (14:35 - 14:38)
when they go back to the office but in (14:37 - 14:40)
reality all the people working at the (14:38 - 14:41)
pokemon company international probably (14:40 - 14:42)
working at home (14:41 - 14:44)
um so we're gonna pull this off serbia (14:42 - 14:47)
first one is the uh wild there's new (14:44 - 14:49)
wild area event (14:47 - 14:51)
uh it's themed around luck which has (14:49 - 14:54)
meowth dharmanitan magikarp and (14:51 - 14:56)
pseudo-widow available shiny magikarp is (14:54 - 14:58)
available (14:56 - 15:00)
and it will go between january 1st (14:58 - 15:03)
through january 9th (15:00 - 15:06)
so this is like the third time in sword (15:03 - 15:08)
and shield they've done (15:06 - 15:12)
shiny magic car parades (15:08 - 15:12)
i uh (15:12 - 15:16)
i i don't know who's still i'm sure tons (15:14 - 15:17)
of people are still playing swords and (15:16 - 15:20)
shield honestly it's it's a very good (15:17 - 15:21)
game (15:20 - 15:23)
uh if if even if you have shiny magikarp (15:21 - 15:24)
the cool thing about these raids is (15:23 - 15:26)
you're gonna get at least one big nugget (15:24 - 15:28)
every raid no matter if it's a one star (15:26 - 15:30)
or three star five star it's guaranteed (15:28 - 15:32)
one big nugget i'm showing you (15:30 - 15:34)
magikarp's only five star (15:32 - 15:35)
um (15:34 - 15:37)
and uh the other drops are just like (15:35 - 15:39)
regular nuggets (15:37 - 15:42)
so there's tons of ways to make money we (15:39 - 15:43)
were talking about this last week (15:42 - 15:45)
actually there's only like one way to (15:43 - 15:46)
make money in brilliant time in shining (15:45 - 15:48)
pearl that's to beat up the old people (15:46 - 15:50)
there is (15:48 - 15:52)
lots of ways to make money in this game (15:50 - 15:54)
you could do the luxury ball exchange (15:52 - 15:56)
you can do raids you can do with the (15:54 - 16:00)
heavy sigh wheel i'm just you know (15:56 - 16:03)
just knitting away here knitting away (16:00 - 16:05)
i mean it feels like you wanted to add (16:03 - 16:06)
some commentary to (16:05 - 16:08)
the very truthful fact the only (16:06 - 16:10)
commentary i have to add is i thought (16:08 - 16:12)
that gambling in pokemon games was (16:10 - 16:14)
prohibited so why are they giving out (16:12 - 16:17)
nuggets for raids on random chance that (16:14 - 16:19)
this can't be allowed in the eu (16:17 - 16:22)
it's not random isn't it every time (16:19 - 16:24)
yeah but the amount that you get is (16:22 - 16:26)
randomized there's a drop table (16:24 - 16:28)
uh (16:26 - 16:29)
listed (16:28 - 16:31)
i wonder if they're going to keep doing (16:29 - 16:33)
these the last ride was also the last (16:31 - 16:36)
raid event was also a week long the (16:33 - 16:38)
deliberate one this one's a week a (16:36 - 16:40)
little more than a week i wonder if (16:38 - 16:42)
they're gonna keep doing that uh it's a (16:40 - 16:44)
it's a metric week (16:42 - 16:49)
metric week yeah ten days not seven (16:44 - 16:54)
no metric week not an imperial week (16:49 - 16:54)
freedom week freedom week (16:54 - 16:59)
freedom week is (16:57 - 17:03)
10 days but we call it seven (16:59 - 17:03)
we have the next rule set for vgc here (17:06 - 17:12)
uh it will begin on february 1st it will (17:10 - 17:16)
go through august 31st so this (17:12 - 17:19)
is the longest season rules i don't know (17:16 - 17:20)
what to call it season rule set for (17:19 - 17:23)
sword and shield seems like this is also (17:20 - 17:26)
going to be the final rule set for (17:23 - 17:29)
worlds 2022 since it's going to august (17:26 - 17:32)
31st and worlds usually takes place (17:29 - 17:33)
beginning of august (17:32 - 17:35)
the rule set expands on the previous (17:33 - 17:37)
rule set that allows two restricted (17:35 - 17:39)
pokemon it allows for the pokemon for (17:37 - 17:42)
galler isle of armor and crown tundra (17:39 - 17:45)
including pokemon not in uh not in the (17:42 - 17:48)
decks as such as some legendary and two (17:45 - 17:51)
restricted legendaries per team (17:48 - 17:52)
uh (17:51 - 17:55)
it will allow for dynamics once again (17:52 - 17:56)
and all pokemon must have the galler (17:55 - 18:00)
symbol or the battle ready symbol (17:56 - 18:02)
so this is uh i think (18:00 - 18:04)
this is the equivalent to the gs cup two (18:02 - 18:06)
legends (18:04 - 18:08)
two (18:06 - 18:09)
you could always have as many legends as (18:08 - 18:11)
you want you could technically do reggie (18:09 - 18:14)
rock reggie steel red jice and then (18:11 - 18:16)
mesquite as a (18:14 - 18:17)
that could be your team (18:16 - 18:19)
but the restricted legends for those (18:17 - 18:20)
maybe not (18:19 - 18:22)
familiar with competitive are usually (18:20 - 18:23)
the legends that are featured on the box (18:22 - 18:25)
of the game (18:23 - 18:26)
uh (18:25 - 18:27)
so that would be like your restaurant (18:26 - 18:30)
your zekrom solgaleo lunala (18:27 - 18:31)
xerneas (18:30 - 18:34)
uh kyogre groudon so in past seasons you (18:31 - 18:36)
could only pick one of those (18:34 - 18:39)
so um the two most popular in the past (18:36 - 18:44)
seasons were uh kyogre and then zashian (18:39 - 18:47)
zashian cannot dynamax though (18:44 - 18:49)
so zashian would (18:47 - 18:52)
sometimes be like next to (18:49 - 18:54)
like a tornado because tornados is not (18:52 - 18:58)
restricted or a thunderous (18:54 - 19:00)
or whatever rhetorical (18:58 - 19:03)
my favorite legend torkle yeah (19:00 - 19:07)
so nice you shiny hunted it twice (19:03 - 19:09)
uh or spectra glasture those are also (19:07 - 19:12)
technically not box legends so you'll (19:09 - 19:14)
see a lot of those although calorics (19:12 - 19:16)
would be so once (19:14 - 19:18)
once rabbit boy is riding horse then (19:16 - 19:21)
that (19:18 - 19:21)
i think from what i've seen people are (19:22 - 19:27)
very excited about this this is what (19:26 - 19:29)
people wanted (19:27 - 19:31)
for in sword and shield was the the two (19:29 - 19:32)
restricted (19:31 - 19:35)
and it's nice that this is is a pretty (19:32 - 19:37)
long season because (19:35 - 19:39)
sometimes the meta starts changing near (19:37 - 19:41)
the end of those shorter seasons which (19:39 - 19:43)
were like three months and then (19:41 - 19:45)
boom season switched (19:43 - 19:47)
so i i've seen people be real positive (19:45 - 19:49)
but you know competitive people they get (19:47 - 19:51)
they get real excited and then (19:49 - 19:52)
something happens and then they're like (19:51 - 19:54)
ah kyogre (19:52 - 19:56)
well it's always kyogre's fault well (19:54 - 19:58)
yeah but in six months the meta is going (19:56 - 20:00)
to be really stale and then it'll be (19:58 - 20:02)
worlds and we'll see the same (20:00 - 20:07)
six pokemon on every team for worlds (20:02 - 20:09)
and maybe a (20:07 - 20:11)
pachirisu miracle breaks through again (20:09 - 20:15)
yeah there you go we can only hope (20:11 - 20:15)
i think that's i think it's a that's (20:17 - 20:22)
exciting though i mean again (20:19 - 20:24)
they've said many times brilliant (20:22 - 20:25)
diamond shining pearl is not the (20:24 - 20:27)
competitive game (20:25 - 20:29)
uh (20:27 - 20:30)
brilliant diamond shining pearl has done (20:29 - 20:32)
everything in its power to make sure (20:30 - 20:33)
that you don't enjoy competitive in that (20:32 - 20:36)
game (20:33 - 20:36)
so we'll (20:38 - 20:41)
uh (20:40 - 20:44)
i i i would like to (20:41 - 20:47)
i would like to give this a try i'll (20:44 - 20:49)
wait though i'll like it starts february (20:47 - 20:50)
1st (20:49 - 20:51)
i'll give it a couple weeks to see (20:50 - 20:52)
what's (20:51 - 20:55)
what's happening (20:52 - 20:57)
i don't i'm sure people are already (20:55 - 20:59)
building teams on (20:57 - 21:00)
showdown and already testing i'm sure (20:59 - 21:02)
people were already doing that before (21:00 - 21:03)
the season was announced oh yeah (21:02 - 21:06)
do you have your uh metronome team ready (21:03 - 21:08)
i don't have my metronome team ready (21:06 - 21:10)
that is that is this coming friday if (21:08 - 21:11)
you're listening to this podcast on (21:10 - 21:15)
january 3rd you have until january i (21:11 - 21:17)
believe six to register you must (21:15 - 21:18)
register (21:17 - 21:21)
before the tournament starts (21:18 - 21:23)
when you register you have your team (21:21 - 21:24)
ready you don't have to have your team (21:23 - 21:26)
ready when you register the the it (21:24 - 21:28)
starts technically thursday night (21:26 - 21:31)
because it starts utc time um (21:28 - 21:32)
but (21:31 - 21:34)
if you're looking for the metronome cup (21:32 - 21:36)
that's this weekend starts on (21:34 - 21:39)
technically january 7th (21:36 - 21:40)
um (21:39 - 21:42)
pretty easy to do you're just picking (21:40 - 21:44)
you don't even need six pokemon just (21:42 - 21:46)
pick like three or four because they're (21:44 - 21:49)
all going to know metronome (21:46 - 21:51)
and they can learn they can know nothing (21:49 - 21:54)
else but metronome correct yes correct (21:51 - 21:56)
so do you have to get rid of all the (21:54 - 21:59)
moves or they can only know one move (21:56 - 22:00)
metronome (21:59 - 22:02)
you can dynomax technically but (22:00 - 22:05)
metronome just turns into max guard (22:02 - 22:08)
so you're literally just (22:05 - 22:10)
stalling (22:08 - 22:12)
maybe you metronomed to toxic (22:10 - 22:15)
yes there you go toxic stall actually (22:12 - 22:17)
that's not too bad (22:15 - 22:20)
metro no toxic than max card (22:17 - 22:23)
uh (22:20 - 22:23)
uh (22:26 - 22:30)
the next bit of news here (22:27 - 22:32)
oh actually this next bit of news is (22:30 - 22:34)
more of an article (22:32 - 22:36)
so maybe we should we should take our (22:34 - 22:38)
break and come back uh we can we can we (22:36 - 22:40)
can squeeze in some more news before (22:38 - 22:41)
yeah because i don't want to start (22:40 - 22:43)
talking about that it's the it's the (22:41 - 22:45)
interview stuff (22:43 - 22:47)
stu uh there's gotta be something i (22:45 - 22:50)
gotta talk about james coming to india (22:47 - 22:53)
is that a thing we wanna talk about what (22:50 - 22:55)
it's not the antics website oh yeah (22:53 - 22:56)
they're they're (22:55 - 22:57)
like (22:56 - 23:00)
greatly increasing the number of pokemon (22:57 - 23:02)
poke stops (23:00 - 23:05)
in india to the point where they can't (23:02 - 23:06)
have they don't have pictures for all of (23:05 - 23:08)
them yeah (23:06 - 23:10)
so they're basically waiting for people (23:08 - 23:13)
to submit pictures of the pokestops then (23:10 - 23:16)
they'll fill those in later yeah (23:13 - 23:18)
so they (23:16 - 23:23)
i i don't understand the comma use (23:18 - 23:27)
in the article on pokemon go (23:23 - 23:27)
is it (23:27 - 23:30)
five hundred thousand (23:28 - 23:33)
or did they miss a zero and it's five oh (23:30 - 23:36)
wait which which side is this on it's on (23:33 - 23:38)
pokemon go live (23:36 - 23:40)
hold on (23:38 - 23:44)
because in most of the non-freedom world (23:40 - 23:46)
uh the commas and periods and numbers (23:44 - 23:49)
are flipped (23:46 - 23:49)
so (23:50 - 23:54)
yeah that's (23:51 - 23:57)
more gyms and pokestops coming to india (23:54 - 24:01)
it's like it's like the second paragraph (23:57 - 24:03)
they said five million new gyms and (24:01 - 24:05)
pokestops in india but it's missing a (24:03 - 24:06)
zero (24:05 - 24:08)
so then that's missing oh that's just a (24:06 - 24:11)
typo okay i couldn't tell i'm like okay (24:08 - 24:14)
so which is this part is wrong (24:11 - 24:16)
yeah because if you're flipping the the (24:14 - 24:17)
commas and the periods you'd only have (24:16 - 24:20)
one comma and multiple periods and (24:17 - 24:21)
there's (24:20 - 24:24)
yeah it's very anyways so five million (24:21 - 24:27)
news yeah it's either like 500 well half (24:24 - 24:29)
a million or five million those those (24:27 - 24:31)
are close numbers you know oh or is it (24:29 - 24:34)
five hundred thousand yeah i think five (24:31 - 24:36)
hundred thousand i think five hundred (24:34 - 24:38)
thousand is with that makes more sense (24:36 - 24:38)
yeah (24:38 - 24:40)
but then why why is that how many people (24:38 - 24:43)
are in india all of them oh boy (24:40 - 24:46)
like india is like a real real big it's (24:43 - 24:49)
a huge country well okay so there's the (24:46 - 24:51)
the the this we don't want to get into (24:49 - 24:52)
geography cast because that always gets (24:51 - 24:54)
us in trouble but (24:52 - 24:56)
i think india is the second most (24:54 - 24:58)
populated country (24:56 - 25:01)
not china number one yeah but not the (24:58 - 25:03)
most like it doesn't have the biggest (25:01 - 25:06)
land mass so according to (25:03 - 25:08)
google (25:06 - 25:11)
it's 1.38 (25:08 - 25:15)
billion people (25:11 - 25:15)
five million seems like a lot (25:16 - 25:20)
yeah yeah it's probably five hundred (25:18 - 25:21)
thousand five hundred and seventy five (25:20 - 25:23)
accidentally hit the comment in there (25:21 - 25:24)
let me get a comment there (25:23 - 25:26)
uh (25:24 - 25:27)
do we all know the population of the (25:26 - 25:29)
united states (25:27 - 25:32)
uh 1 billion (25:29 - 25:32)
that's how many hamburgers that (25:33 - 25:37)
mcdonald's has sold (25:35 - 25:39)
no (25:37 - 25:40)
try again (25:39 - 25:42)
will what's your what's your uh (25:40 - 25:44)
250 million (25:42 - 25:46)
that's closer (25:44 - 25:50)
that's too low 500 million it's (25:46 - 25:55)
329.5 million people yes so we have (25:50 - 25:57)
less than roughly a third (25:55 - 25:59)
of the population (25:57 - 26:02)
of india in the united states just (25:59 - 26:04)
as as a reference point (26:02 - 26:07)
uh (26:04 - 26:09)

good amount it's a free poll uh so they (28:56 - 29:02)
post their news in as pt specific time (28:59 - 29:06)

that their times are pacific time (29:06 - 29:10)
um they added two new seasonal scouts (29:10 - 29:17)
they added vulchner (29:14 - 29:19)

when you rematch faulkner he will (29:25 - 29:29)
finally have an elective ire (29:27 - 29:32)
i feel like (29:29 - 29:32)
for a (29:33 - 29:37)
special suit (29:35 - 29:40)
pair (29:37 - 29:41)
that one was isn't surprising like (29:40 - 29:43)
usually they have something like whoa (29:41 - 29:45)
i've never thought they'd do (29:43 - 29:48)
that with that combo and it's like (29:45 - 29:52)
oh you gave him what he has in the games (29:48 - 29:55)
they've run out of ideas look why is it (29:52 - 29:56)
if we're talking about characters that (29:55 - 29:59)
have zero development and personality (29:56 - 30:01)
volvo has a lot of personality it's (29:59 - 30:03)
called depression (30:01 - 30:04)
oh (30:03 - 30:06)
he has it (30:04 - 30:09)
and then you talk him out of it very (30:06 - 30:10)
quickly (30:09 - 30:13)
it wasn't deep (30:10 - 30:16)
um and then sabrina has a chingling (30:13 - 30:18)
which is like that's what should be (30:16 - 30:19)
that's the thing like that's right (30:18 - 30:24)
profit's great profit is very good (30:19 - 30:24)
uh (30:27 - 30:30)
i believe all of them (30:28 - 30:33)
can evolve in the game currently so most (30:30 - 30:35)
likely yes you'd be able to evolve (30:33 - 30:38)
jingling into a chimebeco (30:35 - 30:38)

aimed at players who may be having a (34:22 - 34:25)
tough time completing the champions (34:24 - 34:28)
stadium on hard difficulty jokes on you (34:25 - 34:31)
masters i haven't even tried stadium (34:28 - 34:35)
once i'm too busy pulling characters (34:31 - 34:37)
by completing them (34:35 - 34:39)
by completing this content you should (34:37 - 34:40)
learn enough tips and tricks of the (34:39 - 34:42)
trade to be able to complete the (34:40 - 34:44)
champion stadium on hard to play this (34:42 - 34:45)
content you have to complete the (34:44 - 34:48)
champion stadium on normal first (34:45 - 34:49)
the sink pairs that are used in this (34:48 - 34:52)
content are fixed so you won't have to (34:49 - 34:54)
worry about training your own and anyone (34:52 - 34:55)
will be able to win as long as they have (34:54 - 34:57)
a grasp of basic battle that's actually (34:55 - 35:00)
kind of cool (34:57 - 35:00)
they needed something because (35:00 - 35:06)
the difficulty spike between normal and (35:03 - 35:07)
hard (35:06 - 35:08)
is real steep (35:07 - 35:11)
like you could blow through you can blow (35:08 - 35:13)
through normal on auto and be like (35:11 - 35:15)
whatever uh you cannot do that on the (35:13 - 35:16)
harder (35:15 - 35:18)
ones at all you do sort of have to know (35:16 - 35:21)
what you're doing (35:18 - 35:21)
um (35:21 - 35:25)
we are aiming for this content to be (35:23 - 35:28)
released around late february so please (35:25 - 35:30)
wait a little bit longer (35:28 - 35:31)
as we mentioned at the end of last year (35:30 - 35:33)
the cino chapter of the villain arc is (35:31 - 35:35)
scheduled to begin on january 12th we (35:33 - 35:37)
hope you look forward to it (35:35 - 35:39)
our next message is scheduled for late (35:37 - 35:40)
january in it we plan to share (35:39 - 35:42)
information about new sync pairs and (35:40 - 35:45)
events for february (35:42 - 35:45)
we're always looking we're always (35:45 - 35:48)
working (35:47 - 35:50)
hard to deliver updates and improvements (35:48 - 35:52)
to make the world of pokemon masters ex (35:50 - 35:55)
as fun as possible (35:52 - 35:55)
uh masters is in a decent place (35:59 - 36:04)
yeah i i (36:02 - 36:06)
i know the thing you probably hear is (36:04 - 36:08)
like oh there's so many paid banners (36:06 - 36:10)
yeah they're yeah but (36:08 - 36:12)
they're not for you (36:10 - 36:14)
they're banner their banners are still a (36:12 - 36:15)
problem like there's still way too many (36:14 - 36:18)
banners and it's very confusing (36:15 - 36:20)
um (36:18 - 36:23)
but i think (36:20 - 36:23)
for game play like you don't have to do (36:24 - 36:28)
the hard stuff at all and you still get (36:26 - 36:31)
a lot of rewards so if you're a casual (36:28 - 36:34)
player you can do (36:31 - 36:35)
just the (36:34 - 36:38)
normal and like super hard stuff and (36:35 - 36:39)
still get a lot of rewards and those (36:38 - 36:41)
rewards (36:39 - 36:44)
are enough for how you play the game (36:41 - 36:46)
um (36:44 - 36:48)
they've somewhat fixed the amount of (36:46 - 36:50)
gems you get so that (36:48 - 36:53)
you get more polls more often nowadays (36:50 - 36:56)
than you did in the past so (36:53 - 36:57)
getting (36:56 - 37:00)
a pull of all three stars (36:57 - 37:02)
doesn't hurt as (37:00 - 37:04)
bad as it used to (37:02 - 37:07)
um so i think they've really done a lot (37:04 - 37:09)
to (37:07 - 37:12)
make the game more (37:09 - 37:14)
friendly (37:12 - 37:15)
to (37:14 - 37:17)
the casual player and i think they've (37:15 - 37:20)
improved the ability to have it reward (37:17 - 37:22)
you for the amount of time you're (37:20 - 37:24)
willing to put in so even if you only (37:22 - 37:26)
put in (37:24 - 37:29)
15 minutes a day like i do you still (37:26 - 37:30)
feel like you're getting (37:29 - 37:33)
an appropriate amount of awards that (37:30 - 37:35)
that was worth putting those 15 minutes (37:33 - 37:38)
in and i i would i couldn't have said (37:35 - 37:40)
that a year ago (37:38 - 37:40)
yeah (37:41 - 37:43)
all right let's take a break (37:44 - 37:47)
when we come back we're gonna talk about (37:45 - 37:48)
this uh (37:47 - 37:51)
interview that came out of nowhere and (37:48 - 37:53)
uh then we'll do our question of the (37:51 - 37:54)
week and pokemon of the week so we will (37:53 - 37:57)
be right back (37:54 - 38:00)
[Music] (37:57 - 38:00)
[Music] (38:03 - 38:08)
[Applause] (38:05 - 38:08)
this is the year of miraculous (38:13 - 38:18)
[Applause] (38:15 - 38:18)
[Music] (38:19 - 38:22)
some could argue that 2019 is the year (38:23 - 38:29)
of practice (38:25 - 38:29)
[Music] (38:32 - 38:38)
this is (38:34 - 38:38)
and we are back from our break (38:47 - 38:53)
all right this was like the (38:51 - 38:55)
i don't know if it's breaking news good (38:53 - 38:56)
news (38:55 - 38:58)
scandal of the year (38:56 - 39:01)
the year just started i know the (38:58 - 39:03)
scandals are very low level so far (39:01 - 39:05)
[Music] (39:03 - 39:08)
it's not even a scandal (39:05 - 39:08)
i am sure there are other sites that (39:09 - 39:12)
have their own translations (39:10 - 39:16)
uh this is a japanese interview so (39:12 - 39:18)
we'll see how good their japanese (39:16 - 39:21)
translation is here this is off nintendo (39:18 - 39:23)
everything.com but again i'm sure other (39:21 - 39:26)
people have translated it (39:23 - 39:26)
over on its recruitment website (39:26 - 39:31)
uh gamefreak posted an article about the (39:29 - 39:34)
creation of sword and shield director uh (39:31 - 39:37)
surgery or omori (39:34 - 39:39)
sajuru i think it's (39:37 - 39:40)
tsujir (39:39 - 39:43)
suzuru (39:40 - 39:43)
and planning director uh i e ew oh wait (39:44 - 39:52)
hold on eyes are ease (39:49 - 39:52)
i think it's wow (39:54 - 39:56)
wow (39:55 - 39:58)
provided some insight on how switch (39:56 - 40:01)
games could be made uh nintendo (39:58 - 40:05)
everything translated the full piece (40:01 - 40:05)
uh so amore (40:05 - 40:09)
for those that don't know (40:07 - 40:13)
um they directed (40:09 - 40:15)
sun and moon (40:13 - 40:18)
and (40:15 - 40:18)
black and white (40:18 - 40:23)
or was it black too white (40:20 - 40:26)
too um pretty much omori directed the (40:23 - 40:28)
games that masuda did not direct is what (40:26 - 40:30)
it comes down to (40:28 - 40:30)
uh (40:32 - 40:35)
let's see so it starts off saying uh (40:37 - 40:41)
amore was the director of sword and (40:39 - 40:43)
shield amore was involved since ruby and (40:41 - 40:45)
sapphire as well as a number of other (40:43 - 40:46)
pokemon games (40:45 - 40:47)
eewow (40:46 - 40:49)
was the planning director for sword and (40:47 - 40:51)
shield and they excel in the field of ui (40:49 - 40:53)
planning they led the project with amore (40:51 - 40:56)
throughout development (40:53 - 40:59)
um it says amore and few other key staff (40:56 - 41:01)
members started to think about the com (40:59 - 41:03)
concept of a new pokemon game right (41:01 - 41:05)
after pokemon sun and moon development (41:03 - 41:08)
finished in the fall of 2016. (41:05 - 41:09)
with the knowledge that the switch can (41:08 - 41:11)
connect to a television the initial idea (41:09 - 41:14)
was to make the pokemon title larger in (41:11 - 41:16)
scope in order to surprise players amore (41:14 - 41:19)
met with ewow who directed ultra sun (41:16 - 41:21)
ultramoon (41:19 - 41:24)
and things started in september of 2017 (41:21 - 41:27)
amore named the games after the the team (41:24 - 41:29)
thought of giving pokemon swords and (41:27 - 41:31)
shields to fight gigantic pokemon (41:29 - 41:33)
the development team was very particular (41:31 - 41:35)
about the graphics for the new game (41:33 - 41:36)
especially when factoring in that it (41:35 - 41:37)
would be able to be connected to the big (41:36 - 41:39)
screen the team wanted the title to be (41:37 - 41:42)
enjoyable in both docked and portable (41:39 - 41:44)
mode amore reflected in the project (41:42 - 41:46)
saying that he placed heavy emphasis on (41:44 - 41:48)
how the game would fit into players (41:46 - 41:50)
lifestyles and how the team could (41:48 - 41:51)
incorporate the strengths of the new (41:50 - 41:53)
console he also mentioned throughout (41:51 - 41:54)
that they considered the planning and (41:53 - 41:56)
design of the game the original pokemon (41:54 - 41:58)
games were made by a very small team and (41:56 - 42:00)
their approach to improving the quality (41:58 - 42:03)
of different aspects with something (42:00 - 42:05)
break it then make it again (42:03 - 42:07)
improvements to technology made it (42:05 - 42:08)
impossible for them to use the same (42:07 - 42:10)
approach to be used this time as (42:08 - 42:12)
development teams have become much (42:10 - 42:14)
larger amore knew that the approach of (42:12 - 42:17)
the new games like older generations (42:14 - 42:19)
amore knew that if he approached the new (42:17 - 42:21)
games like the older generations it (42:19 - 42:23)
would cause mass confusion to prevent (42:21 - 42:25)
any confusion or misunderstanding amore (42:23 - 42:27)
assembled a small core team at the very (42:25 - 42:30)
start of development that conceived the (42:27 - 42:31)
design for the titles (42:30 - 42:33)
this allowed the team to put everything (42:31 - 42:37)
they had planned into the game (42:33 - 42:37)
so (42:38 - 42:41)
um before we get (42:38 - 42:43)
too deep into things (42:41 - 42:46)
uh originally masuda said (42:43 - 42:47)
that (42:46 - 42:49)
they were working on sword and shield (42:47 - 42:51)
for three years (42:49 - 42:52)
and (42:51 - 42:54)
here it says things started in september (42:52 - 42:56)
of 2017 (42:54 - 42:57)
which (42:56 - 43:00)
uh sword and shield came out in november (42:57 - 43:03)
of 2019 yeah (43:00 - 43:05)
but (43:03 - 43:05)
well (43:06 - 43:09)
but and and people were saying that (43:07 - 43:11)
masuda was lying that was only two years (43:09 - 43:14)
not three years but like (43:11 - 43:16)
you have to plan out the game before you (43:14 - 43:17)
start making it like that still counts (43:16 - 43:19)
as making the game and they started that (43:17 - 43:22)
in the fall planning it in 2016 right (43:19 - 43:23)
yeah like well it's kind of like three (43:22 - 43:25)
years when you're when you're like in (43:23 - 43:28)
middle school and your parents asked you (43:25 - 43:30)
if you started working on your report (43:28 - 43:33)
yet and you had thought about like what (43:30 - 43:35)
you would want to do your report on two (43:33 - 43:38)
days ago so you say yes yes yes i have (43:35 - 43:41)
been working on my reporters (43:38 - 43:44)
i mean i'm sure there's much more (43:41 - 43:44)
of (43:44 - 43:46)
their planning than thinking about it (43:44 - 43:48)
that went into in the start of fall of (43:46 - 43:51)
2016. (43:48 - 43:51)
yeah although i think it's fun that the (43:52 - 43:56)
whole thing started like let's give them (43:54 - 43:57)
swords and shields and make a fight (43:56 - 44:00)
super big pokemon like (43:57 - 44:04)
the thought of like the idea was that (44:00 - 44:06)
i mean we got super big pokemon yeah (44:04 - 44:08)
let's do that let's like make it even (44:06 - 44:10)
more rpg (44:08 - 44:12)
uh (44:10 - 44:15)
fantasy related (44:12 - 44:15)
uh ewow says that one of the most (44:16 - 44:19)
important themes during development of (44:18 - 44:21)
sword and shield was the generational (44:19 - 44:22)
shift among staff (44:21 - 44:24)
he gave higher positions to younger (44:22 - 44:26)
staff members who only had the ability (44:24 - 44:27)
and motivation to take on the (44:26 - 44:29)
responsibility which gave them (44:27 - 44:31)
opportunities to grow and learn the (44:29 - 44:32)
staff should not only have the ability (44:31 - 44:34)
to carry out the tasks placed in front (44:32 - 44:36)
of them but to communicate and build (44:34 - 44:37)
rapport with other team members in a (44:36 - 44:39)
process a project like pokemon cannot be (44:37 - 44:41)
handled individually (44:39 - 44:43)
when asked how younger staff members (44:41 - 44:44)
performed iwa (44:43 - 44:46)
ewow felt the lack of knowledge and (44:44 - 44:48)
experience sometimes showed throughout (44:46 - 44:50)
the project young staff got stuck on (44:48 - 44:52)
numerous occasions and received a lot of (44:50 - 44:54)
advice from more experienced staff (44:52 - 44:56)
members they struggled but eventually (44:54 - 44:57)
made it through with the help of more (44:56 - 44:59)
experienced staff it has always been a (44:57 - 45:01)
tradition at gamefreak to give (44:59 - 45:04)
opportunities to youth even amore he was (45:01 - 45:05)
chosen as the planning director leader (45:04 - 45:08)
for diamond and pearl when he was 25 (45:05 - 45:09)
while all the other staff members were (45:08 - 45:12)
more experienced the organization often (45:09 - 45:14)
changes with every game title which is (45:12 - 45:15)
another thing that makes game freak so (45:14 - 45:18)
unique (45:15 - 45:18)
and this interview was done as a (45:22 - 45:26)
recruiting mechanism if i (45:24 - 45:28)
believe right (45:26 - 45:30)
like a recruitment page yes it was on (45:28 - 45:33)
their their human resources like (45:30 - 45:35)
job listings and stuff so i think i mean (45:33 - 45:37)
that's they're just basically saying (45:35 - 45:38)
that (45:37 - 45:39)
um (45:38 - 45:41)
you know we do give opportunities to (45:39 - 45:42)
younger people to kind of attract (45:41 - 45:47)
younger talent to the company (45:42 - 45:47)
um (45:49 - 45:52)
there's like something in japan too (45:50 - 45:54)
where like (45:52 - 45:55)
there's not a lot of turnover like (45:54 - 45:57)
people get a job and they like stay (45:55 - 45:59)
there (45:57 - 46:01)
uh i mean you're talking to will and (45:59 - 46:02)
greg here okay (46:01 - 46:05)
what are you trying to say (46:02 - 46:05)
i've been at my company for 25 years (46:05 - 46:09)
same (46:08 - 46:11)
[Laughter] (46:09 - 46:12)
uh (46:11 - 46:14)
it's cool for them to say like (46:12 - 46:16)
hey (46:14 - 46:17)
we (46:16 - 46:19)
gave a bunch of things to younger staff (46:17 - 46:21)
and they got stuck (46:19 - 46:23)
and looking back (46:21 - 46:25)
that sucks but also they got through it (46:23 - 46:26)
yeah (46:25 - 46:29)
well it what what they're basically (46:26 - 46:31)
trying to say is (46:29 - 46:32)
we (46:31 - 46:34)
we want you to (46:32 - 46:36)
take on challenges we are willing to (46:34 - 46:39)
give you projects knowing that you will (46:36 - 46:41)
probably get stuck in certain places and (46:39 - 46:44)
we are also here to help you get through (46:41 - 46:45)
them like (46:44 - 46:48)
they recognize that as part of how they (46:45 - 46:50)
build things when they give stuff to (46:48 - 46:52)
inexperienced people they've built into (46:50 - 46:54)
their planning that you are going to get (46:52 - 46:56)
stuck yeah and i didn't know how to do (46:54 - 46:58)
things and it's it's a it's a teaching (46:56 - 47:00)
tool it's an on-the-job (46:58 - 47:02)
teaching thing like (47:00 - 47:04)
let's see if you can figure how to get (47:02 - 47:05)
out of it if there's a new idea or a new (47:04 - 47:08)
way but if it's really bad we will we (47:05 - 47:09)
have people who've gotten past it that (47:08 - 47:12)
can help and it's also advertising their (47:09 - 47:14)
corporate culture to say like if if a (47:12 - 47:16)
younger person comes across a problem (47:14 - 47:18)
that they can't solve then a more (47:16 - 47:20)
experienced person will help them solve (47:18 - 47:22)
the problem right as opposed to like the (47:20 - 47:25)
culture that i promote where if a less (47:22 - 47:26)
experienced person comes to me and says (47:25 - 47:28)
i have this problem i can't solve i say (47:26 - 47:30)
what am i paying you for i hired you to (47:28 - 47:32)
solve that problem (47:30 - 47:34)
i will find somebody better than you yes (47:32 - 47:37)
that's a boss (47:34 - 47:37)
uh as the director leading the project (47:37 - 47:41)
there were several several factors mori (47:39 - 47:44)
paid attention to one of them was amore (47:41 - 47:45)
uh (47:44 - 47:47)
to delegate individual tasks that (47:45 - 47:49)
excelled that they excelled at for (47:47 - 47:51)
instance through communicating with the (47:49 - 47:53)
staff mori gave clothing design (47:51 - 47:55)
to those who liked fashion sporty (47:53 - 47:57)
clothes sporty clothes to staff (47:55 - 47:59)
interested in sport cafe lovers would (47:57 - 48:01)
design the spot to ensure the cafe like (47:59 - 48:04)
feeling and so on omori wanted every (48:01 - 48:06)
individual to be able to bring out their (48:04 - 48:08)
strengths this resulted in the team (48:06 - 48:10)
members having the freedom to express (48:08 - 48:12)
themselves and is perhaps one of the (48:10 - 48:14)
reasons why the game was enjoyed by so (48:12 - 48:17)
many one of the director's job is to (48:14 - 48:18)
create an environment which brings the (48:17 - 48:21)
best out of all its staff (48:18 - 48:22)
amory adds that he wanted to continue (48:21 - 48:24)
being a part of the new projects in the (48:22 - 48:27)
future he shares that he wanted (48:24 - 48:29)
to start new projects not by designing (48:27 - 48:30)
but for making prototypes of games (48:29 - 48:33)
instead he aims for games to be made by (48:30 - 48:35)
not only planners but also designers and (48:33 - 48:37)
programmers this allows for anyone to be (48:35 - 48:39)
able to pitch in and create games that (48:37 - 48:42)
can be enjoyed by even more people (48:39 - 48:42)
look i will i will definitely say the (48:43 - 48:47)
the clothing (48:46 - 48:50)
and like the city design and the theming (48:47 - 48:52)
of sword and shield is (48:50 - 48:54)
incredible yep (48:52 - 48:56)
yeah lots of fun (48:54 - 48:57)
yeah i think (48:56 - 48:58)
it (48:57 - 48:59)
i think (48:58 - 49:01)
knowing like this is just a fun thing to (48:59 - 49:03)
point out like (49:01 - 49:04)
we (49:03 - 49:05)
got input from people who know those (49:04 - 49:09)
cultures right like we know what (49:05 - 49:11)
we went to the sports people to design (49:09 - 49:13)
the uniforms we went to the cafe people (49:11 - 49:15)
to get these things the people had (49:13 - 49:17)
experience which makes those things feel (49:15 - 49:19)
so much more real because like if you're (49:17 - 49:21)
interested in those things you're like (49:19 - 49:23)
oh yeah that totally fits the vibe it's (49:21 - 49:26)
just nice that they underlined that and (49:23 - 49:28)
also on a recruitment page saying like (49:26 - 49:31)
we will look at your whole life (49:28 - 49:33)
and your experiences outside of the (49:31 - 49:36)
company to help bring ideas in it's just (49:33 - 49:38)
it's another sort of nod to what they (49:36 - 49:40)
think their culture is like as opposed (49:38 - 49:43)
to my culture where i say if i wanted (49:40 - 49:45)
your input on clothing design i would (49:43 - 49:47)
have hired you for the clothing design (49:45 - 49:50)
team please go back to your sql (49:47 - 49:51)
programming and leave stop with your (49:50 - 49:53)
inputs thank you (49:51 - 49:56)
ilka (49:53 - 49:56)
um (49:59 - 50:02)
even after 20 years the the pokemon (50:00 - 50:04)
franchise is still going strong amore (50:02 - 50:06)
says that even if he thinks (50:04 - 50:08)
the game is perfect there will always be (50:06 - 50:10)
new ideals after the project is over he (50:08 - 50:12)
added that pokemon will continue to (50:10 - 50:13)
change with new technology new (50:12 - 50:15)
development teams and a new way of (50:13 - 50:18)
playing games omori wants to create (50:15 - 50:20)
pokemon games that gamers desire and (50:18 - 50:22)
give the feeling that pokemon exist and (50:20 - 50:24)
live with us (50:22 - 50:26)
it might be surprising to hear that (50:24 - 50:28)
every pokemon title is made entirely in (50:26 - 50:30)
an entirely different way team members (50:28 - 50:32)
do not rely on (50:30 - 50:34)
team members trying not to rely on (50:32 - 50:36)
experience and enjoy tackling the new (50:34 - 50:37)
challenge given to them (50:36 - 50:39)
ewow uh emphasizes that no matter the (50:37 - 50:41)
work if you (50:39 - 50:43)
do it long enough it will eventually (50:41 - 50:45)
become tedious with game freak however (50:43 - 50:47)
there are always new opportunities new (50:45 - 50:49)
positions being able to join in the gear (50:47 - 50:52)
projects we've talked about those before (50:49 - 50:53)
meaning that it will never get (50:52 - 50:54)
repetitive and never gets boring with (50:53 - 50:56)
the vast amount of experience spanning (50:54 - 50:58)
over 20 years a unique system that (50:56 - 51:01)
allows youth to experience failure and (50:58 - 51:03)
success and a company continuing to (51:01 - 51:05)
change generations pokemon will continue (51:03 - 51:08)
to evolve (51:05 - 51:08)
and again that was all translated by (51:10 - 51:14)
nintendo everything (51:12 - 51:15)
i'm going to skip some words or (51:14 - 51:16)
sentences (51:15 - 51:18)
i mean they had like i mean they give (51:16 - 51:20)
credit to the two people that help them (51:18 - 51:21)
do it i don't know who those people are (51:20 - 51:24)
but (51:21 - 51:24)
i'm sure you can find them on twitter (51:24 - 51:29)
so we're all applying for jobs at game (51:27 - 51:30)
freak right i mean (51:29 - 51:34)
they want youth i'm we're all old excuse (51:30 - 51:36)
speak for yourself thank you very much (51:34 - 51:38)
you you feel your age (51:36 - 51:40)
will and i are both young at heart and (51:38 - 51:42)
ready for a new career we have prove it (51:40 - 51:45)
we have proven that we are loyal (51:42 - 51:47)
capable of seeing projects too through (51:45 - 51:49)
to the end (51:47 - 51:51)
we can you they can pull on our (51:49 - 51:53)
experience and we can actually put pride (51:51 - 51:55)
ware into (51:53 - 51:57)
there you go come on outfits look we got (51:55 - 52:03)
it all we are we are the hires to hire (51:57 - 52:03)
also we know how to cut and paste (52:07 - 52:12)
i'm very good at the conversation (52:10 - 52:14)
c control v (52:12 - 52:16)
control v (52:14 - 52:20)
so i'm excellent at it (52:16 - 52:20)
i don't i don't think sword and shield (52:24 - 52:28)
are perfect games by any means (52:26 - 52:30)
no (52:28 - 52:30)
uh i mean (52:30 - 52:35)
they're very very good (52:34 - 52:37)
yeah they got very they got way better (52:35 - 52:40)
with the dlcs (52:37 - 52:40)
yeah (52:41 - 52:44)
yeah i think i think i would probably (52:42 - 52:47)
put (52:44 - 52:47)
i think i would probably put ultrasound (52:47 - 52:50)
ultramoon as my favorite pokemon game (52:49 - 52:54)
but because of the dlc (52:50 - 52:54)
sword and shield are i sorry chill i (52:54 - 52:59)
think are in my top (52:57 - 53:01)
top five for sure i don't know that they (52:59 - 53:03)
don't know that they're top three (53:01 - 53:05)
i'm trying to but it's also hard for me (53:03 - 53:07)
because it's hard to be like (53:05 - 53:09)
well i haven't played that game in a (53:07 - 53:12)
while so it's hard to rate them yeah but (53:09 - 53:13)
i i mean honestly emerald's my number (53:12 - 53:15)
one and i would (53:13 - 53:18)
probably say (53:15 - 53:18)
hmm (53:18 - 53:22)
i would probably say black and white are (53:20 - 53:25)
probably my next (53:22 - 53:28)
not black to white too (53:25 - 53:29)
black and white one is much better than (53:28 - 53:32)
black 2x2 them all the same game right (53:29 - 53:34)
like (53:32 - 53:35)
i (53:34 - 53:37)
i would happily start on the other one (53:35 - 53:38)
you start on the west side the other you (53:37 - 53:40)
start on the east side come on (53:38 - 53:42)
uh i mean they're very similar games so (53:40 - 53:44)
put them the tough thing is what would (53:42 - 53:47)
be three and three is a very tough (53:44 - 53:50)
slot to figure out because i do think (53:47 - 53:52)
it's probably (53:50 - 53:54)
sun and moon (53:52 - 53:56)
but like sword and shield fight for it (53:54 - 53:58)
so it's like i think those two fight (53:56 - 54:01)
between three and four a lot because sun (53:58 - 54:03)
and moon which also encompasses (54:01 - 54:05)
ultrasound ultra moon we're really i put (54:03 - 54:06)
a lot i had a lot of fun with those (54:05 - 54:08)
games i put a lot of hours in those (54:06 - 54:10)
games i found them very refreshing i (54:08 - 54:12)
would probably for me put x and y above (54:10 - 54:15)
sun and moon i just i (54:12 - 54:17)
just think that that cohesive (54:15 - 54:20)
rose gates everything no yeah x and y (54:17 - 54:22)
would be higher if i didn't hate the (54:20 - 54:26)
pacing of that game so much (54:22 - 54:26)
man bring back the roller skates the (54:27 - 54:31)
thing is uh i think like diamond and (54:28 - 54:33)
pearl has slipped (54:31 - 54:37)
because of the remakes (54:33 - 54:37)
the thing that i think of when i like (54:37 - 54:40)
read (54:39 - 54:42)
when i read this (54:40 - 54:46)
is i just think of other nintendo games (54:42 - 54:48)
and when you like read comments or you (54:46 - 54:52)
see tweets or other people post or just (54:48 - 54:53)
discussions with other online (54:52 - 54:55)
communities you always hear the you hear (54:53 - 54:58)
like the (54:55 - 54:58)
there what was the line that stood out (54:58 - 55:03)
here it was um (55:00 - 55:03)
ah geez where did it go uh amore knew (55:04 - 55:08)
that if he approached the noon games (55:07 - 55:10)
like the older generation it would cause (55:08 - 55:12)
mass confusion that line is a little (55:10 - 55:12)
weird (55:12 - 55:14)
but like i don't think it's weird in the (55:12 - 55:18)
grand scheme of like (55:14 - 55:18)
even though each pokemon game like (55:19 - 55:24)
sticks to a formula like you will go you (55:21 - 55:27)
will battle eight gym leaders you will (55:24 - 55:29)
catch pokemon you will have four moves (55:27 - 55:32)
you will use the water move against the (55:29 - 55:37)
fire move like that that formula works (55:32 - 55:38)
but (55:37 - 55:40)
how (55:38 - 55:41)
do you make (55:40 - 55:44)
the things around it unique (55:41 - 55:47)
and how do you make the things around it (55:44 - 55:50)
go this game is different than this game (55:47 - 55:52)
right you you can look at sword and (55:50 - 55:56)
shield and you can go this game has the (55:52 - 55:58)
big pokemon (55:56 - 56:00)
you can look at (55:58 - 56:02)
sun and moon and you could be like this (56:00 - 56:06)
game has the hawaii island themes (56:02 - 56:08)
has all the holes (56:06 - 56:09)
this is the whole game (56:08 - 56:11)
you can look at diamond and pearl and go (56:09 - 56:13)
this game has the dumb mountain in the (56:11 - 56:15)
middle of them (56:13 - 56:17)
this guy's a big mountain (56:15 - 56:19)
right like i think that i that's what (56:17 - 56:22)
stands out in that sentence to me of (56:19 - 56:24)
like how do we make this how do we make (56:22 - 56:26)
this game (56:24 - 56:28)
look different to people (56:26 - 56:31)
who may or may no pokemon or may not (56:28 - 56:33)
know pokemon and so i think of that in (56:31 - 56:35)
the same way as i think of like a mario (56:33 - 56:37)
or a zelda game (56:35 - 56:39)
all mario games are the same (56:37 - 56:42)
you you collect something you collect (56:39 - 56:44)
enough something to battle bowser and (56:42 - 56:47)
then you save the kingdom right like and (56:44 - 56:48)
throughout that entire time you're (56:47 - 56:50)
jumping and you're ground you're butt (56:48 - 56:52)
slamming and you're you're you're (56:50 - 56:54)
flipping right like that's all the same (56:52 - 56:56)
in mario games i don't like platformers (56:54 - 56:59)
so i have to take your word for it the (56:56 - 57:02)
but every mario game has its own gimmick (56:59 - 57:05)
right like sunshine has the jet pack (57:02 - 57:07)
odyssey has the hat that turns into (57:05 - 57:10)
things right but like at its core (57:07 - 57:12)
oh galaxies where we went to planets (57:10 - 57:14)
right yeah yeah oh sorry not galaxy uh (57:12 - 57:16)
yeah galaxy's planets odyssey obviously (57:14 - 57:18)
the hat (57:16 - 57:20)
but at its core it's the same as pokemon (57:18 - 57:21)
right like that core is the same the (57:20 - 57:24)
same zelda right right the core (57:21 - 57:26)
even breath of the wild which is this (57:24 - 57:28)
open world zelda game the the core is (57:26 - 57:30)
still the same you're collecting heart (57:28 - 57:32)
pieces you're collecting rubies you're (57:30 - 57:35)
getting more tools for your utility belt (57:32 - 57:36)
because you're like (57:35 - 57:39)
elf batman and then you'd fight a giant (57:36 - 57:42)
pig at the end um (57:39 - 57:42)
well can a ganon's a pig (57:43 - 57:47)
just rude (57:45 - 57:50)
probably are you sure gannon is organic (57:47 - 57:50)
no (57:50 - 57:53)
dannon is the pig ganondorf is the human (57:50 - 57:54)
okay (57:53 - 57:57)
yeah i know my zelda (57:54 - 57:59)
but again like zelda's core is (57:57 - 58:00)
ultimately the same (57:59 - 58:02)
but the things around it are different (58:00 - 58:05)
you know one has a horse one has a boat (58:02 - 58:07)
one has a train one has a hat that makes (58:05 - 58:08)
you really small but (58:07 - 58:12)
one turns you into it's a cap (58:08 - 58:14)
yeah exactly i don't know why pokemon (58:12 - 58:16)
fans (58:14 - 58:18)
can't see that though or some pokemon (58:16 - 58:20)
fans can't see that like they what (58:18 - 58:22)
see that like (58:20 - 58:24)
of course the main thing of the game is (58:22 - 58:26)
going to stay the same (58:24 - 58:28)
and of course not everything (58:26 - 58:30)
from an old pokemon game is going to (58:28 - 58:32)
come to a new like like imagine if zelda (58:30 - 58:34)
did that like hey this game we had a (58:32 - 58:36)
boat but now we took the boat away and (58:34 - 58:38)
we're making you a wolf and they're like (58:36 - 58:40)
no but bring the boat back and it's like (58:38 - 58:42)
you can't be both people are like break (58:40 - 58:43)
the boat back (58:42 - 58:47)
but i mean i think the thing is is (58:43 - 58:47)
everybody disagrees with what is a core (58:47 - 58:54)
mechanic and a vital part of (58:50 - 58:57)
a pokemon experience right (58:54 - 58:59)
like (58:57 - 58:59)
because rpg is a very very broad term (58:59 - 59:07)
unlike a platformer which is a mechanic (59:03 - 59:09)
rpg (59:07 - 59:12)
rpg the main mechanic for any rpg is you (59:09 - 59:15)
battle things and you level up (59:12 - 59:16)
and (59:15 - 59:19)
that is the actual core of an rpg like (59:16 - 59:21)
game mechanics wise like when you say (59:19 - 59:23)
mario has the same core mechanic it's a (59:21 - 59:26)
platformer they know they play the same (59:23 - 59:27)
way like when (59:26 - 59:30)
paper mario was an rpg (59:27 - 59:33)
you fought things and you leveled up (59:30 - 59:34)
like those are the core mechanics i (59:33 - 59:36)
think where people get (59:34 - 59:39)
unnecessarily in the weeds is when they (59:36 - 59:43)
decide what the other core mechanics (59:39 - 59:45)
are and those things shouldn't be (59:43 - 59:48)
changed like some people say (59:45 - 59:51)
the eight gyms is a core mechanic for (59:48 - 59:53)
pokemon and thus hate (59:51 - 59:56)
uh sun and moon for getting rid of a (59:53 - 59:58)
core mechanic but it's not a core (59:56 - 60:03)
mechanic per se it is a it is a a core (59:58 - 60:05)
element for most of the games but that (60:03 - 60:07)
element can be swapped out yeah a highly (60:05 - 60:09)
identified feature right so like the (60:07 - 60:11)
boat versus riding the wolf versus (60:09 - 60:13)
riding the horse like (60:11 - 60:15)
yeah that's the same as how many gyms (60:13 - 60:16)
you are you're going to end up riding (60:15 - 60:18)
something (60:16 - 60:20)
to get to up to an elevator you didn't (60:18 - 60:22)
ride the wolf you turned into the wolf (60:20 - 60:24)
look (60:22 - 60:26)
i can ride the wolf if i want to i've (60:24 - 60:28)
seen statues of (60:26 - 60:29)
something on the back of that wolf (60:28 - 60:32)
[Laughter] (60:29 - 60:32)
but i mean the thing is is one of the (60:33 - 60:37)
strengths about pokemon games is there (60:34 - 60:39)
are so many (60:37 - 60:42)
consistent elements that people (60:39 - 60:44)
latch onto that's what that's one of the (60:42 - 60:47)
powers of that franchise is there's (60:44 - 60:49)
generally something for everybody to (60:47 - 60:50)
like (60:49 - 60:52)
but it also has the downside of if they (60:50 - 60:55)
change the thing that you like (60:52 - 60:57)
you're not going to like that game as (60:55 - 60:58)
much (60:57 - 60:59)
like if they if your whole thing is i (60:58 - 61:01)
want to fight gyms and they change the (60:59 - 61:04)
gyms and make it trials (61:01 - 61:05)
those games aren't going to be your (61:04 - 61:07)
thing anymore like you don't find that (61:05 - 61:10)
progression fun (61:07 - 61:10)
question of the week (61:20 - 61:24)
uh (61:25 - 61:27)
yeah (61:26 - 61:30)
um hold on (61:27 - 61:30)
um (61:32 - 61:35)
what's the question of the week i want (61:36 - 61:42)
to hear it now (61:39 - 61:42)
evan says what 2022 is the year of (61:45 - 61:50)
dot dot we have not decided that pokemon (61:48 - 61:51)
can't ask that is the question of the (61:50 - 61:54)
week that is the twitch stream nightmare (61:51 - 61:56)
only and we get told what it is after (61:54 - 61:58)
yeah it's and then i disagree with it it (61:56 - 62:00)
doesn't even matter because he doesn't (61:58 - 62:01)
do anything with it it's the it was the (62:00 - 62:03)
year 2021 year over the cryogenial did (62:01 - 62:05)
any did any did that come up in any (62:03 - 62:07)
merch did that come up as an emote did (62:05 - 62:09)
they come up with anything (62:07 - 62:12)
no it was just decided and left in the (62:09 - 62:13)
dust i mean (62:12 - 62:16)
criminal deserves that (62:13 - 62:19)
no no pokemon deserves that other than (62:16 - 62:21)
meditate (62:19 - 62:24)
uh steven says as 2021 comes to an end (62:21 - 62:26)
what is your favorite pokemon related (62:24 - 62:30)
experience in the year of 2021 (62:26 - 62:33)
that's a good one that's a good one (62:30 - 62:33)
none of them (62:33 - 62:36)
i (62:38 - 62:42)
will i it's hard to say one experience (62:39 - 62:44)
but i would say all the walks that greg (62:42 - 62:45)
and i took in the (62:44 - 62:48)
park yeah on pokemon go community days (62:45 - 62:52)
we had a lot we had a lot of fun (62:48 - 62:54)
meandering through the little art park (62:52 - 62:57)
um i would say (62:54 - 62:57)
uh i really had a like (62:58 - 63:04)
i would say like the kanto tour was (63:02 - 63:06)
important to be like (63:04 - 63:07)
going (63:06 - 63:10)
back into public and doing things in (63:07 - 63:12)
person with a bunch of us again was a (63:10 - 63:14)
really big (63:12 - 63:17)
important moment of 2021. (63:14 - 63:18)
um (63:17 - 63:22)
that was just sort of like (63:18 - 63:22)
a big breath of normality (63:22 - 63:27)
even though nothing about what we did (63:25 - 63:29)
that day was very normal (63:27 - 63:32)
it was just being back together like (63:29 - 63:35)
chris flew in you drove in (63:32 - 63:38)
uh people were here we found people at (63:35 - 63:43)
the mall like it was just a very (63:38 - 63:43)
nice (63:44 - 63:49)
slice of normality in what had been and (63:45 - 63:51)
continues to be (63:49 - 63:53)
a sort of chaotic (63:51 - 63:56)
year (63:53 - 63:56)
um go fest (64:02 - 64:06)
felt (64:05 - 64:09)
even more normal than kanto to her well (64:06 - 64:11)
yeah because you walked for eight hours (64:09 - 64:13)
with a big backpack strapped to your (64:11 - 64:17)
back that's normal for you weirdo (64:13 - 64:17)
um (64:18 - 64:20)
there were there were definitely pokemon (64:20 - 64:24)
go streams (64:23 - 64:29)
that i did that just (64:24 - 64:29)
like like the (64:30 - 64:34)
pokemon go fest or i think i streamed on (64:31 - 64:35)
bdoof day (64:34 - 64:37)
um (64:35 - 64:40)
there was the stream one of the final (64:37 - 64:42)
ghost streams i did downtown milwaukee (64:40 - 64:42)
on the (64:42 - 64:46)
in like bay view like like (64:42 - 64:48)
even though i wasn't with you guys or i (64:46 - 64:50)
wasn't with anyone (64:48 - 64:52)
in particular like having (64:50 - 64:55)
the backpack on and showing people like (64:52 - 64:57)
the city that i've lived in for 30 some (64:55 - 64:59)
years and like people asking questions (64:57 - 65:01)
and us getting like like i think i got (64:59 - 65:03)
the flying shiny balloon pikachu or (65:01 - 65:05)
whatever in in one of those streams and (65:03 - 65:08)
it was like really exciting (65:05 - 65:10)
like those moments (65:08 - 65:14)
because of pokemon stand out to me (65:10 - 65:16)
so much right like th and this is why (65:14 - 65:18)
pokemon go is such an important game to (65:16 - 65:21)
me like i don't what other video game (65:18 - 65:23)
would be like i get to (65:21 - 65:26)
play this game and show you all a city i (65:23 - 65:30)
grew up in for so long um (65:26 - 65:32)
like it like those those moments (65:30 - 65:35)
definitely stand out to me yeah um (65:32 - 65:37)
what i'm bummed is when i thought about (65:35 - 65:40)
that nothing really related to the 25th (65:37 - 65:43)
anniversary stuck out to me right true (65:40 - 65:45)
true like (65:43 - 65:45)
pokemon go did a better job at making (65:47 - 65:54)
memories on their fifth year (65:50 - 65:54)
yeah (65:56 - 65:59)
and that's that's a little frustrating (65:57 - 66:01)
to me um pokemon snap was super (65:59 - 66:03)
surprising (66:01 - 66:06)
yeah oh yeah (66:03 - 66:07)
but that could have came out anywhere (66:06 - 66:09)
that could come out any year and me (66:07 - 66:12)
playing it by myself isn't (66:09 - 66:14)
pokemon unite was very good (66:12 - 66:15)
yeah (66:14 - 66:17)
again it came out any year it could have (66:15 - 66:20)
come out in a year it's not like (66:17 - 66:22)
it also it's not like my favorite (66:20 - 66:26)
pokemon related like 2021 was a good (66:22 - 66:28)
pokemon year (66:26 - 66:30)
i'm still (66:28 - 66:32)
let down by the fact that it was (66:30 - 66:33)
supposed to be an anniversary year and (66:32 - 66:36)
really nothing directly to the (66:33 - 66:39)
anniversary was all that spectacular (66:36 - 66:40)
like i've listened to that album once (66:39 - 66:42)
and i have not gone back to it since (66:40 - 66:47)
there's nothing on there to draw me back (66:42 - 66:47)
they had some good merch (66:48 - 66:51)
you were telling me that the partnership (66:53 - 66:57)
with oreos didn't do it for you no (66:54 - 66:58)
i (66:57 - 67:01)
i found my mew i ate my mew and moved on (66:58 - 67:03)
you know what was actually a decent (67:01 - 67:05)
25-year thing (67:03 - 67:09)
the pokemon celebrations tcg that set (67:05 - 67:13)
for this year was easily one of the best (67:09 - 67:16)
sets that they've put out in a long time (67:13 - 67:17)
exactly very fun (67:16 - 67:20)
pikachu was that that set no the yes the (67:17 - 67:22)
farting pikachu one yeah oh (67:20 - 67:24)
very fun (67:22 - 67:27)
to open and to collect (67:24 - 67:30)
for anyone (67:27 - 67:33)
from hardcore tcg to i only buy three (67:30 - 67:36)
booster packs a year kind of person (67:33 - 67:36)
i think that set was pretty great (67:37 - 67:41)
do we have a youtubey (67:42 - 67:48)
no no youtube questions sorry (67:44 - 67:50)
i forgot to ask (67:48 - 67:51)

answer it i i'll remember to post but i (68:03 - 68:07)
have a question for (68:05 - 68:10)
that is uh why isn't will here (68:07 - 68:12)
oh yeah we will not be in the show next (68:10 - 68:16)
week correct that's true uh because our (68:12 - 68:17)
you're going to be gone for what week or (68:16 - 68:19)
two (68:17 - 68:22)
just one week (68:19 - 68:23)
please i can't afford hawaii for more (68:22 - 68:26)
than like seven or eight days (68:23 - 68:26)
give us our extra long pokemon of the (68:27 - 68:32)
week then uh well it's not extra long (68:29 - 68:35)
actually but last week's pokemon of the (68:32 - 68:36)
week (68:35 - 68:39)
was a complaint about sincerely sinnoh (68:36 - 68:42)
and the cantileve gym and what's really (68:39 - 68:45)
funny though is on listening to (68:42 - 68:48)
subsequent episodes of sincerely cinno (68:45 - 68:51)
steve is like oh this pokemon is in the (68:48 - 68:53)
what's her name candace's gym because it (68:51 - 68:55)
knows ice punch (68:53 - 68:57)
and like basically making my argument (68:55 - 69:02)
for me um but yes it is a pokemon that (68:57 - 69:05)
is not a steel type pokemon but it knows (69:02 - 69:07)
a steel type move (69:05 - 69:09)
can actually learn two steel type moves (69:07 - 69:11)
in other games (69:09 - 69:13)
in other games yes (69:11 - 69:14)
uh (69:13 - 69:17)
etc etc (69:14 - 69:18)
so (69:17 - 69:21)
who's the pokemon (69:18 - 69:21)
meta jam (69:22 - 69:26)
no (69:24 - 69:28)
it's a zoomer (69:26 - 69:31)
azu merrell yes (69:28 - 69:31)
i also said i don't have blue ink and (69:32 - 69:38)
blue is like azure (69:35 - 69:38)
the aqua rabbit pokemon (69:39 - 69:44)
i still (69:42 - 69:46)
i mean it's kind of like it's a rabbit (69:44 - 69:47)
but it (69:46 - 69:50)
has long rabbit ears (69:47 - 69:50)
i do not like it shuffle icon (69:51 - 69:58)
i don't this never happens i know i (69:55 - 69:59)
don't even know where it is i can't see (69:58 - 70:03)
it why is (69:59 - 70:03)
it is really bad why is it winking (70:05 - 70:09)
why do they need the need to include its (70:10 - 70:14)
tail yeah and (70:12 - 70:17)
and shortcut the ears (70:14 - 70:19)
it's just weird (70:17 - 70:21)
well because it's got the the the little (70:19 - 70:23)
merrell tail that like merrell bounces (70:21 - 70:24)
on the tail (70:23 - 70:26)
right right (70:24 - 70:29)
yeah yeah good still (70:26 - 70:32)
like a gold a really great gold shiny i (70:29 - 70:35)
was gonna say nine times out of ten the (70:32 - 70:36)
like (70:35 - 70:38)
original shinies are better and then (70:36 - 70:41)
some when they when in the newer games (70:38 - 70:43)
i don't know if they got less colors or (70:41 - 70:43)
they (70:43 - 70:45)
hit the wrong saturation button but (70:43 - 70:49)
sometimes they they turn out being bad (70:45 - 70:52)
azumarell got much better much better (70:49 - 70:56)
solid solid solid (70:52 - 70:56)
um (71:00 - 71:03)
for the page being this long there is (71:01 - 71:04)
nothing (71:03 - 71:05)
[Laughter] (71:04 - 71:08)
in generation five zumerel and merrell (71:05 - 71:10)
are the only pokemon that can have (71:08 - 71:12)
electric type as their sole weakness (71:10 - 71:14)
this is because of their hidden ability (71:12 - 71:15)
sap zipper (71:14 - 71:17)
azumaril is the only member of its (71:15 - 71:19)
evolutionary line that was not publicly (71:17 - 71:21)
revealed prior to its generation at (71:19 - 71:24)
debuting (71:21 - 71:24)
that's some real trivia there for you (71:26 - 71:31)
huh (71:29 - 71:31)
you know why generation five is good no (71:35 - 71:40)
one talks about this hidden abilities um (71:36 - 71:43)
the dream world (71:40 - 71:43)
i didn't know (71:46 - 71:49)
that swamp rabbits was a specific type (71:49 - 71:55)
of rabbit why not why not (71:52 - 71:56)
love a good swamp rabbit (71:55 - 72:00)
i mean i always just assumed (71:56 - 72:00)
rabbits could swim (72:01 - 72:06)
but apparently that's (72:04 - 72:09)
a thing about swat rabbits is they have (72:06 - 72:12)
a strong preference for wet areas and (72:09 - 72:15)
you can swim i don't think of rabbits as (72:12 - 72:18)
big swimmers no (72:15 - 72:19)
but apparently that's a thing because (72:18 - 72:21)
it's based off of a swamp rabbit well (72:19 - 72:23)
there's swimming deer in the florida (72:21 - 72:24)
keys so that's something you'd never (72:23 - 72:27)
think about either here in florida (72:24 - 72:30)
in the florida keys in the keys yeah (72:27 - 72:33)
they're very specific key the isla oh (72:30 - 72:35)
wow (72:33 - 72:37)

united states is key west will did you (72:49 - 72:54)

steve (72:56 - 72:59)
33 (72:57 - 73:01)
figuring out what why it's called a (72:59 - 73:03)
quarter pounder at mcdonald's (73:01 - 73:05)
oh yeah because i commented because he (73:03 - 73:07)
said no i was watching the twitch stream (73:05 - 73:10)
and he said he said a quarter pounder (73:07 - 73:12)
because it's a fourth of a beef and i (73:10 - 73:14)
was like no no no (73:12 - 73:18)
it's a 20 25 of a beef (73:14 - 73:21)
not a fourth of a beef (73:18 - 73:21)
uh what we need to wrap this what is (73:22 - 73:26)
next week's pokemon (73:24 - 73:28)
here we go (73:26 - 73:30)
one of my nieces recently commented on (73:28 - 73:33)
my snapchat streak stating that comby is (73:30 - 73:35)
a dumb pokemon and that her boyfriend (73:33 - 73:38)
thinks chikorita is better (73:35 - 73:40)
i responded that there are no good (73:38 - 73:42)
pokemon whose names start with the (73:40 - 73:43)
letter c (73:42 - 73:45)
she replied with a particular legendary (73:43 - 73:48)
pokemon that has a mass of one hectogram (73:45 - 73:51)
and who shares half of its two-move move (73:48 - 73:54)
pool with magikarp and whose final (73:51 - 73:56)
evolution depends on the game where it (73:54 - 73:57)
is evolved (73:56 - 74:01)
obviously she remains incorrect (73:57 - 74:03)
that's easy (74:01 - 74:05)
is it (74:03 - 74:07)
yeah it's chat because (74:05 - 74:08)
it starts with a c (74:07 - 74:12)
it's chat that legendary pokemon (74:08 - 74:12)

monthly subscription to a yearly (74:45 - 74:49)
subscription you can do that (74:46 - 74:51)

one ain't happening that's not happening (75:20 - 75:25)
