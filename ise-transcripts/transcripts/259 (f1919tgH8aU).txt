[Music] (0:02 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to the 250 (0:20 - 0:25)
ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:29)
it's super effective i am your host SBJ (0:25 - 0:34)
and with me today i have Travis I'm (0:29 - 0:35)
really thrown off because I don't think (0:34 - 0:39)
any of the podcasts that I do record it (0:35 - 0:41)
on the day that they usually record so (0:39 - 0:44)
everything just feels wrong including (0:41 - 0:46)
this one yeah yeah we're doing this on (0:44 - 0:49)
my Thursday night as I said like four (0:46 - 0:51)
days ago i'm having company over so i (0:49 - 0:52)
won't have time to record or whatnot (0:51 - 0:55)
house I've will with us today are you (0:52 - 0:57)
sure it's me because obviously I'm a (0:55 - 1:00)
liar that's true even though you can (0:57 - 1:02)
look at your iphone and tell exactly (1:00 - 1:06)
where on earth I am I'm a liar I'm not (1:02 - 1:08)
in Virginia I did I didn't think of it (1:06 - 1:12)
at the time how was Virginia that's fine (1:08 - 1:14)
i was playing vanguard i lost every (1:12 - 1:16)
match it's not the end of the world wait (1:14 - 1:19)
you're is your how this is a dumb (1:16 - 1:20)
question how long does it take for you (1:19 - 1:22)
to get to virginia are you just going to (1:20 - 1:24)
like the border and like making it some (1:22 - 1:26)
big deal of going to another state (1:24 - 1:28)
because if i say i'm going to illinois (1:26 - 1:30)
that takes me at least an hour to get (1:28 - 1:35)
there okay for me to get to maryland is (1:30 - 1:39)
about in eight minute drive for me to (1:35 - 1:42)
get to virginia is maybe like a 10 (1:39 - 1:45)
minute drive off see but to get to where (1:42 - 1:48)
i was going in virginia it was a (1:45 - 1:52)
45-minute Drive okay 45 minutes play (1:48 - 1:56)
some Vanguard yes all right let's just (1:52 - 1:58)
let the cat out of the bag I don't know (1:56 - 2:00)
why that's why is that an expression (1:58 - 2:02)
who's putting cats and begs I think it (2:00 - 2:05)
was the expression to imply something (2:02 - 2:08)
that is irreversible right like you (2:05 - 2:11)
can't put a cat back in a bag that would (2:08 - 2:13)
be ridiculous to try to cats out the bag (2:11 - 2:16)
hands out of the bag first you skin they (2:13 - 2:18)
don't I don't need yours I don't even (2:16 - 2:21)
hear you're like a Dartmouth methodology (2:18 - 2:24)
if be if the open within my way to skin (2:21 - 2:27)
a cat big enough yeah it would be very (2:24 - 2:31)
easy okay so by the time this goes up (2:27 - 2:34)
which is you know monday more everyone (2:31 - 2:37)
morning but like a week 0 from now by (2:34 - 2:41)
the time this goes up the newest season (2:37 - 2:45)
of mythical will be out on itunes under (2:41 - 2:49)
the whole mythical podcast RSS feed (2:45 - 2:51)
which is separate then it's super (2:49 - 2:54)
effective this has been we we recorded (2:51 - 2:58)
this season and another episode of (2:54 - 3:01)
that's it that's all your news that's (2:58 - 3:02)
everything no housecleaning see you (3:01 - 3:07)
later so over the past couple months (3:02 - 3:10)
people like these people like Travis and (3:07 - 3:13)
these people like Micah and all these (3:10 - 3:15)
other people have mentioned that there (3:13 - 3:17)
was these secret projects that I (3:15 - 3:19)
wouldn't let them talk about that and I (3:17 - 3:21)
think I think it's okay to talk about (3:19 - 3:24)
that now now that we have we have (3:21 - 3:26)
something tangible to give to people (3:24 - 3:29)
because of that right we all got (3:26 - 3:31)
together first week in december in (3:29 - 3:35)
wisconsin and we recorded a bunch of (3:31 - 3:38)
audio which includes the season of (3:35 - 3:40)
mythical that again by the time you hear (3:38 - 3:42)
this will be out in iTunes and on (3:40 - 3:45)
soundcloud and and on google play and we (3:42 - 3:48)
we recorded more audio besides that but (3:45 - 3:50)
right now there's a full season of (3:48 - 3:52)
mythical it is three episodes long it is (3:50 - 3:56)
about two hours give or take and it is a (3:52 - 4:00)
complete story and it doesn't you don't (3:56 - 4:02)
need to listen to any other season to (4:00 - 4:05)
follow along I think that's fair to yeah (4:02 - 4:08)
I mean it's a it's a prequel so it's (4:05 - 4:12)
takes place it went stant who is he's I (4:08 - 4:15)
don't remember how old stant is in the (4:12 - 4:19)
present day of mythical but he's an old (4:15 - 4:22)
older man and this takes place when Stan (4:19 - 4:26)
willow the character that Logan plays in (4:22 - 4:29)
mythical was in high school so it's a (4:26 - 4:32)
and we used the we didn't use DMD this (4:29 - 4:34)
time we use the role playing game fiasco (4:32 - 4:39)
which is much more improvisational and (4:34 - 4:42)
there's no dia more GM it's all (4:39 - 4:45)
collaborative so it was a a more sort of (4:42 - 4:48)
impromptu experience and (4:45 - 4:51)
I think it ended up being the funniest (4:48 - 4:54)
thing we've ever recorded so so I think (4:51 - 4:57)
Logan did mention that it's 44 years (4:54 - 5:00)
before whatever dungeons and dragon i'ts (4:57 - 5:03)
yeah I don't I don't think that matters (5:00 - 5:06)
too much like I don't want it I don't (5:03 - 5:07)
want it to sound more complicated than (5:06 - 5:10)
it is because like Travis mentions dance (5:07 - 5:12)
and it's like why don't know Stan so (5:10 - 5:14)
maybe it is don't don't but yeah you (5:12 - 5:16)
don't you don't need to know because (5:14 - 5:19)
it's a prequel all of this happens like (5:16 - 5:22)
you know there's not any any effects (5:19 - 5:24)
that you won't know the cause of right (5:22 - 5:26)
because it's just in the same way that (5:24 - 5:28)
you could basically look at any story (5:26 - 5:30)
from the earliest moment of it and be (5:28 - 5:33)
fine like you you could watch Star Wars (5:30 - 5:35)
Episode one before episode 4 and not (5:33 - 5:37)
really miss anything same with this it (5:35 - 5:38)
doesn't really matter where you start (5:37 - 5:41)
you can start an episode 1 of mythical (5:38 - 5:43)
or you could start right here with what (5:41 - 5:47)
do we call init schoolyards and slowpoke (5:43 - 5:49)
schools and schools and slow pokes yeah (5:47 - 5:53)
yeah yeah yeah but people there there I (5:49 - 5:55)
mean for people who are already fans of (5:53 - 5:56)
the series right there's there's (5:55 - 6:01)
character appearances that yes maybe (5:56 - 6:03)
people would know and stand is a main (6:01 - 6:05)
character but you don't have to know (6:03 - 6:08)
those characters going in right to have (6:05 - 6:11)
some and and just like most role-playing (6:08 - 6:12)
games i would say that like the (6:11 - 6:13)
characters that are being played or (6:12 - 6:17)
pretty over personified like it's very (6:13 - 6:18)
eat i don't know if that's the right (6:17 - 6:20)
word it's very easy to like kind of (6:18 - 6:21)
understand what kind of character they (6:20 - 6:23)
are pretty quickly because they're (6:21 - 6:25)
actually in this season i would say (6:23 - 6:26)
because they're all high school students (6:25 - 6:31)
so they are caricatures the other thing (6:26 - 6:33)
i want wanted to mention is what Travis (6:31 - 6:36)
said which is this isn't a game of D&D (6:33 - 6:41)
this is gamma fiasco and mythical is not (6:36 - 6:45)
there to teach you how to play Fiasco or (6:41 - 6:47)
really how to teach you how to play D&D (6:45 - 6:50)
I think in in the first couple seasons (6:47 - 6:53)
there would be characters like me or (6:50 - 6:55)
Jeff or somebody with that would ask (6:53 - 6:57)
questions and I think those questions (6:55 - 7:00)
were valuable to the listener especially (6:57 - 7:01)
for people who are like I have never (7:00 - 7:01)
played the (7:01 - 7:03)
d so i don't know if i should listen to (7:01 - 7:06)
this but in fiasco you guys don't really (7:03 - 7:10)
explain the rules but you and and I did (7:06 - 7:12)
cut out some of the rules just because (7:10 - 7:13)
they were there were either very (7:12 - 7:17)
specific questions that maybe Irene had (7:13 - 7:19)
that only evolved that only mattered in (7:17 - 7:22)
like a very specific situation they (7:19 - 7:24)
weren't like general rules right so I (7:22 - 7:25)
tried to keep general rules in without (7:24 - 7:28)
there's like weird balance of making (7:25 - 7:30)
sure that as a listener even if you've (7:28 - 7:33)
never played fiasco the core system (7:30 - 7:36)
makes sense but there's also this (7:33 - 7:38)
balance of making sure there's not so (7:36 - 7:41)
many rules that would be not really that (7:38 - 7:44)
much helpful to a listener anyways that (7:41 - 7:46)
would that would bog it down and make it (7:44 - 7:47)
sound boring when you listen to episode (7:46 - 7:51)
1 and the first 22 minutes or quote (7:47 - 7:54)
unquote rules it's really not rules it's (7:51 - 7:57)
more of this is my character this is my (7:54 - 7:59)
personality this is how my character (7:57 - 8:02)
knows this character and this is what my (7:59 - 8:05)
characters goal is for this season and I (8:02 - 8:07)
think that lays it out pretty well while (8:05 - 8:09)
you might not get while you might not (8:07 - 8:11)
walk away understanding how to play (8:09 - 8:12)
Fiasco with your friends I think you (8:11 - 8:14)
walk away understanding I know the (8:12 - 8:16)
characters I know what the characters (8:14 - 8:18)
intentions are and I also know what the (8:16 - 8:20)
characters final goal is did I say that (8:18 - 8:22)
okay yeah I think it's a perfect way to (8:20 - 8:27)
sum up fiasco am I allowed to and you (8:22 - 8:29)
can cut this out am I allowed to say the (8:27 - 8:32)
other thing we did there because at when (8:29 - 8:34)
we are in when we're all recording (8:32 - 8:36)
together because when we're at the dells (8:34 - 8:38)
because I know when listeners are going (8:36 - 8:41)
to hear a three-episode season you know (8:38 - 8:44)
that mythical has been non-existent for (8:41 - 8:46)
so long and he hit us back with only (8:44 - 8:49)
three episodes like part of me wants to (8:46 - 8:51)
say no you talk you can talk about it (8:49 - 8:54)
yeah so the fiasco game that we played (8:51 - 8:58)
was just intended to be a silly little (8:54 - 8:59)
one off that we would put in the feed (8:58 - 9:03)
for april fools day and just because (8:59 - 9:07)
it's a sillier game and it was a the (9:03 - 9:10)
specific setting we decided of Stan's (9:07 - 9:12)
high school experience was silly enough (9:10 - 9:14)
itself that it was just going to be a (9:12 - 9:15)
silly little thing to throw in the fee (9:14 - 9:17)
as we were playing it we realized it was (9:15 - 9:19)
one of the most fun things we've done so (9:17 - 9:23)
it kind of ballooned into its own thing (9:19 - 9:25)
but that wasn't the main reason we were (9:23 - 9:28)
at the dells to record that that was (9:25 - 9:29)
just a side thing we were doing we (9:28 - 9:33)
recorded a full additional season of (9:29 - 9:35)
mythical that's your that's closer to (9:33 - 9:38)
the length of seasons one and two and (9:35 - 9:42)
it's not a silly high school story I (9:38 - 9:43)
mean it's still silly because its (9:42 - 9:46)
mythical but it's it is a continuation (9:43 - 9:49)
of the stories from season one and two (9:46 - 9:52)
so anyone who's hearing us say oh no (9:49 - 9:54)
just three episodes after waiting this (9:52 - 9:57)
long like there is a full season coming (9:54 - 10:00)
it's just a bear of an edit for Steve I (9:57 - 10:03)
always envisioned mythical being like (10:00 - 10:06)
two seasons a year and i believe on (10:03 - 10:09)
april first it will be exactly five (10:06 - 10:12)
months since a previous mythical came (10:09 - 10:14)
out and to pull back the curtain a (10:12 - 10:19)
little bit when i gave logan and micah (10:14 - 10:22)
and Travis and Greg and Irene those are (10:19 - 10:25)
your remain people in in this new season (10:22 - 10:27)
I gave them all the tools to record and (10:25 - 10:31)
I and and they recorded and when I was (10:27 - 10:35)
listening and I was with my friend Kay (10:31 - 10:37)
was there shout out to K where we're (10:35 - 10:39)
sitting on the other side of the the (10:37 - 10:41)
curtain the recording curtain listening (10:39 - 10:43)
and we both look at each other and go (10:41 - 10:45)
this isn't going to work this is (10:43 - 10:50)
possibly the worst thing I've ever heard (10:45 - 10:54)
I I think I was coming from like an (10:50 - 10:58)
audio perspective right everyone talking (10:54 - 11:01)
into a microphone is hard I think Travis (10:58 - 11:03)
is really good at peaking microphones (11:01 - 11:05)
Logan is really good and welcome at (11:03 - 11:08)
losing microphones and just pretending (11:05 - 11:10)
they don't exist micah is really good at (11:08 - 11:13)
mumbling Greg is really good at that (11:10 - 11:16)
doing that's like that's before he talks (11:13 - 11:19)
and Irene is really good at not staying (11:16 - 11:21)
on conversation so everyone has all (11:19 - 11:25)
these problems that that you know when (11:21 - 11:26)
i'm the one out when I'm listening to (11:25 - 11:28)
this and when I when I'm thinking about (11:26 - 11:29)
okay how do I straw (11:28 - 11:33)
sure the show how can i salvaged the you (11:29 - 11:34)
know three hours they're sitting down (11:33 - 11:36)
here recording I was like there's no way (11:34 - 11:40)
this is going to work I let that audio (11:36 - 11:41)
sit for like a month or so before I even (11:40 - 11:44)
looked at it and when I looked at it I (11:41 - 11:47)
was like oh like this isn't look this (11:44 - 11:49)
isn't as bad as I thought I don't want (11:47 - 11:52)
to spoil the show but there is a little (11:49 - 11:56)
bit of singing in it and a little bit I (11:52 - 11:59)
thought during these these scenes of (11:56 - 12:01)
when these characters are singing I was (11:59 - 12:05)
like there's no way that like this is (12:01 - 12:08)
going to sound good and post and it (12:05 - 12:10)
actually did turn out sounding really (12:08 - 12:13)
okay I get you know three hours of audio (12:10 - 12:15)
and you know I ended I ended up (12:13 - 12:18)
finishing I was joking in slack right (12:15 - 12:20)
because i told i told everyone eight (12:18 - 12:24)
like it took me 15 hours to produce two (12:20 - 12:27)
hours of content and Logan I love him to (12:24 - 12:28)
death was like well I could I could have (12:27 - 12:30)
done that work and saved you 15 hours (12:28 - 12:34)
like I'm a huge control freak and I was (12:30 - 12:35)
like but if you dis is very very true (12:34 - 12:38)
very true but if you did the work I (12:35 - 12:41)
don't think it would sound as good as it (12:38 - 12:42)
sounds that's no that's that's no (12:41 - 12:45)
offense to you but like I want I always (12:42 - 12:47)
want to put out a product that sounds (12:45 - 12:49)
better than anything I put out in the (12:47 - 12:52)
past right like I don't want to go I (12:49 - 12:53)
don't want to put out season mythical (12:52 - 12:55)
and go yes it's okay it's not as good as (12:53 - 12:57)
last season I always want the season to (12:55 - 13:00)
be the best season and honestly this (12:57 - 13:02)
season of mythical and we're going to (13:00 - 13:03)
play like we're gonna play like a (13:02 - 13:05)
two-minute clip here in a second I (13:03 - 13:07)
honestly believe that this season of (13:05 - 13:09)
mythical is probably the best thing I've (13:07 - 13:12)
ever produced sound wise and musical (13:09 - 13:16)
wise and and just how that season flows (13:12 - 13:18)
and I'm really really just proud of (13:16 - 13:21)
everyone who is on that because we you (13:18 - 13:23)
know without without them I don't think (13:21 - 13:25)
it would be as funny I don't think it (13:23 - 13:27)
would be as creative I just really want (13:25 - 13:28)
to encourage people like I'd honestly (13:27 - 13:30)
think this is one of the best things (13:28 - 13:33)
that this team is done I don't want our (13:30 - 13:34)
listeners to be turned off because it's (13:33 - 13:36)
maybe something they're unfamiliar with (13:34 - 13:39)
I think it's just a really cute / good / (13:36 - 13:42)
short story that feels complete (13:39 - 13:44)
hopefully at the end of the day you walk (13:42 - 13:45)
away from it thinking like that was (13:44 - 13:48)
funny right can I say one more thing (13:45 - 13:50)
that might interest people about it yeah (13:48 - 13:53)
the way that we have included Pokemon in (13:50 - 13:56)
the past and mythical is to have in when (13:53 - 13:59)
we played the DMD seasons and mythical (13:56 - 14:02)
was to say there's one class in the game (13:59 - 14:06)
that can have pokemon pals and a lot of (14:02 - 14:08)
the encounters you'll fight are going to (14:06 - 14:09)
be against poke one but that doesn't (14:08 - 14:12)
really fit for Fiasco because it's not (14:09 - 14:15)
the kind of game where you fight things (14:12 - 14:17)
so what we decided to do instead was (14:15 - 14:21)
have our human characters be named after (14:17 - 14:24)
and had their personalities reflect (14:21 - 14:27)
Pokemon so for example Irene's character (14:24 - 14:33)
is her last name is Lopes because she's (14:27 - 14:35)
like a slowpoke and she speaks very (14:33 - 14:37)
slowly so all of the characters are (14:35 - 14:40)
named after pokemon like my character is (14:37 - 14:42)
named vanille after vet nail oxen (14:40 - 14:46)
vanille is very nervous and unsure all (14:42 - 14:48)
of the time which I took from which (14:46 - 14:49)
might seem a weird thing for vanilluxe (14:48 - 14:50)
but I took that from the fact that (14:49 - 14:53)
vanilluxe has multiple heads which I (14:50 - 14:55)
feel like would be a Pokemon that have a (14:53 - 14:57)
difficult time making decisions so (14:55 - 14:59)
that's sort of what vanille is like so (14:57 - 15:00)
so it's sort of a different take on (14:59 - 15:02)
including Pokemon and I think people (15:00 - 15:03)
might find that interesting of like (15:02 - 15:06)
what's the human version of grand mole (15:03 - 15:08)
which you'll see from Micah's character (15:06 - 15:11)
bowl gran Burke what we'll do now is (15:08 - 15:15)
we'll play a quick two-minute clip to (15:11 - 15:18)
you know pique your interest and we'll (15:15 - 15:19)
be right back (15:18 - 15:27)
[Music] (15:19 - 15:30)
hey so um spent a few days what are you (15:27 - 15:39)

the song you're welcome this is a (16:54 - 17:06)
disaster the the perp the purpose of a (16:59 - 17:08)
fiasco game is that nobody gets what (17:06 - 17:10)
they want (17:08 - 17:17)
[Music] (17:10 - 17:22)

I do want to stress that you can start (17:41 - 17:46)
at any season they're designed in a way (17:43 - 17:49)
to be a story from start to finish so (17:46 - 17:50)
don't think you have to listen to season (17:49 - 17:52)
one and two before you get to this new (17:50 - 17:54)
one or what not like you can start at (17:52 - 17:56)
season 1.5 that's going to be an (17:54 - 17:59)
experience from start to finish and if (17:56 - 18:01)
you go and do listen to other seasons (17:59 - 18:03)
you'll start to get references and kind (18:01 - 18:06)
of see how it fits into an overall story (18:03 - 18:08)
so that's kind of our goal there but (18:06 - 18:11)

festival plaza to enter hatch as many (18:54 - 18:58)

already met the goal and you can just (19:11 - 19:15)
sign up for it and get the prize (19:14 - 19:18)
millennial love it rise for luck with (19:15 - 19:20)
nothing are they at the forty four (19:18 - 19:21)
hundred thousand or they just hit the (19:20 - 19:24)
main goal right now uh I was looking for (19:21 - 19:25)
that and I (19:24 - 19:27)
don't know if they've gotten that far (19:25 - 19:29)
yet I dunno they hit the 200,000 but i (19:27 - 19:32)
don't know i mean i guess 400,000 yet i (19:29 - 19:33)
guess the only difference is you're (19:32 - 19:35)
gonna love ball it's not like I i I'm (19:33 - 19:37)
pretty sure that with the speed that (19:35 - 19:39)
they hit the 200,000 they will hit the (19:37 - 19:42)
400,000 so okay that's not a good it's (19:39 - 19:43)
love ball one of the pokeballs that you (19:42 - 19:48)
only get one of in your normal (19:43 - 19:51)
single-player playthrough of the game I (19:48 - 19:52)
feel like we always ask this on an (19:51 - 19:56)
episode and it's dead it's not a very (19:52 - 19:57)
easy thing to just look up and then (19:56 - 20:01)
someone on Twitter full yeah well you're (19:57 - 20:04)
right all right it's the spell short (20:01 - 20:07)
balls that they they have restricted on (20:04 - 20:11)
us that makes no sense but ok what do (20:07 - 20:12)
you mean it makes no sense like why (20:11 - 20:14)
restrict the balls like why I only have (20:12 - 20:17)
one heavy ball and sun and moon that I'm (20:14 - 20:19)
with you Sam Sam Sun out gives you at (20:17 - 20:22)
the top of a mountain because it makes (20:19 - 20:23)
it that much more special whatever (20:22 - 20:26)
Pokemon you put in it I don't really (20:23 - 20:28)
think so because like yeah cuz you just (20:26 - 20:31)
put a ditto in it right and then the (20:28 - 20:34)
ditto passes that ball along now now the (20:31 - 20:37)
ditto ball is not passed down it's the (20:34 - 20:39)
other pokémons ball that's passed down (20:37 - 20:42)
really i thought in like X&Y it was like (20:39 - 20:45)
females passed on the ball but in sun (20:42 - 20:46)
and moon they switched it to males (20:45 - 20:50)
passed on the ball no but did oh it did (20:46 - 20:52)
oh never passes down because this is (20:50 - 20:55)
this is the way that I work I was (20:52 - 20:56)
catching a ditto for one of our (20:55 - 20:58)
listeners so that they'd have an easier (20:56 - 21:00)
time breeding a bros for synchronizers (20:58 - 21:02)
and I was like well let me make this a (21:00 - 21:04)
special treat I'll use my master ball to (21:02 - 21:06)
catch the ditto so master ball will be (21:04 - 21:09)
passed down at all that meant that (21:06 - 21:11)
anything they catch will be in a (21:09 - 21:14)
minister ball and after I did that then (21:11 - 21:17)
i looked up whether the ditto ball gets (21:14 - 21:19)
passed down and not only do master balls (21:17 - 21:22)
not get passed down but the ditto ball (21:19 - 21:24)
does not get passed out at all okay (21:22 - 21:26)
that's good to know why don't you are (21:24 - 21:29)
pokemon breeding sideshow the ditto ball (21:26 - 21:34)
i'm your host Travis wheeler I do the (21:29 - 21:36)
master balls and get passed down but (21:34 - 21:37)
that's good to know I think this is the (21:36 - 21:39)
first time I've ever used a master (21:37 - 21:42)
also it's a really special occasion I (21:39 - 21:44)
always wanted to save my master ball for (21:42 - 21:46)
like a shiny Voltorb or shiny Geodude (21:44 - 21:48)
like something that would explode right (21:46 - 21:51)
but hey I don't ever need to find a (21:48 - 21:53)
shiny that's I'll never have and will (21:51 - 21:57)
with that attitude that's right I 2017 (21:53 - 21:59)

podcast com hit that contact button and (27:50 - 27:55)
that'll get you the same place we have (27:53 - 27:56)
some emails from will will you weren't (27:55 - 27:58)
here last week well for well not from (27:56 - 28:01)
well that's yeah well you know you don't (27:58 - 28:03)
know although I do email you sometimes (28:01 - 28:06)
but not for other people to hear that's (28:03 - 28:10)
cool wrightson from New Jersey oh okay i (28:06 - 28:12)
was like Cole and I talk every single (28:10 - 28:15)
day I read Cole and I talk more than you (28:12 - 28:17)
and I talk buddy so that would be real (28:15 - 28:19)
weird oh that's a bummer thought I was (28:17 - 28:21)
number one in your life you don't play (28:19 - 28:23)
Vanguard dude you also don't send him (28:21 - 28:26)
any snaps yeah neither does call ya dang (28:23 - 28:30)
i'm behind on the snapchat bandwagon ah (28:26 - 28:32)
this question is for will when i (28:30 - 28:36)
defended torterra in my last email you (28:32 - 28:38)
shot it down because you said it was (28:36 - 28:42)
asymmetrical which made it quote bad and (28:38 - 28:46)
wrong my question is this one of your (28:42 - 28:49)
favorite pokemon is kiram also a (28:46 - 28:52)
symmetrical what makes here i'm better (28:49 - 28:55)
than torterra just wondering what your (28:52 - 28:57)
rationale I could even answer I could (28:55 - 29:00)
even answer that it's it's asymmetrical (28:57 - 29:04)
for a specific design purpose the whole (29:00 - 29:05)
point of the pokemon is that it's (29:04 - 29:07)
supposed to represent a sort of (29:05 - 29:10)
shattered balance or a an emptied (29:07 - 29:12)
balance so it wouldn't make sense for it (29:10 - 29:15)
to be symmetrical I'm not will but yeah (29:12 - 29:19)
I mean I can kind of agree with that as (29:15 - 29:22)
well but also it's the fact that kiram (29:19 - 29:27)
is like made from ice and not like (29:22 - 29:31)
half rock and half tree even the way you (29:27 - 29:34)
know grass like tour Tara's top (29:31 - 29:38)
represents like a bonsai garden plant (29:34 - 29:42)
like when you great good for it kiram (29:38 - 29:44)
represents the liquid empty hole that (29:42 - 29:47)
used to be my heart like when you go to (29:44 - 29:51)
when you go to you know trader joe's I (29:47 - 29:53)
don't know where they sell these bonds I (29:51 - 29:54)
should have you ever been to a trader (29:53 - 29:57)
joe you know what trader joe's is you (29:54 - 30:00)
yeah then you should organic food and (29:57 - 30:10)
stuff they got good organic food I mean (30:00 - 30:11)
you could only go to head a little (30:10 - 30:13)
bonsai pear tree you could eat the (30:11 - 30:15)
little pairs and they might be organic (30:13 - 30:18)
would you go to so when you go to Trader (30:15 - 30:20)
Joe's and you get yourself a bonsai tree (30:18 - 30:23)
it's not like that is a symmetrical (30:20 - 30:26)
plant usually the bonsai tree is either (30:23 - 30:28)
on the left or right hand side and then (30:26 - 30:31)
there's like a little sand garden on the (30:28 - 30:33)
other side that you can take a ok your (30:31 - 30:35)
little miniature rake and you can rake (30:33 - 30:38)
your uninformed number one you're (30:35 - 30:41)
talking about a Zen garden not a bonsai (30:38 - 30:44)
tree number two if you do ever come to (30:41 - 30:46)
visit me here in Washington DC I will (30:44 - 30:48)
take you to the bonsai exhibit at the (30:46 - 30:49)
National Arboretum where they actually (30:48 - 30:52)
teach you about all the principles of (30:49 - 30:55)
bonsai which one of them is is balanced (30:52 - 30:58)
and actually growing the tree in such a (30:55 - 31:00)
way in that it represents a balance of (30:58 - 31:04)
nature not an off-kilter at lopsided (31:00 - 31:08)
half who knows what's going on so no (31:04 - 31:11)
disagree and yet trader joe's cells like (31:08 - 31:15)
ninety percent is prepackaged so I like (31:11 - 31:17)
to I like Trader Joe's have you ever (31:15 - 31:20)

good frozen chicken and really good (31:33 - 31:38)

is bacon-flavored popcorn actually it's (31:38 - 31:41)
apple cider (31:40 - 31:44)
if it's tangy and brown wait I don't (31:41 - 31:47)
know what the saying is not a thing (31:44 - 31:49)
that's like that yeah yeah I think it's (31:47 - 31:51)
from the simpsons yeah i think it's if (31:49 - 31:54)
it's hanging around your in cider town (31:51 - 31:57)
if it's clear and yellow you got juice (31:54 - 32:01)
their fellow exactly the best thing at (31:57 - 32:03)
trader joe's is the bacon-flavored (32:01 - 32:05)
popcorn I don't think I've ever had that (32:03 - 32:07)
this is that so good there's a second (32:05 - 32:09)
question here from coal if you guys ever (32:07 - 32:11)
get back into doing less competitive (32:09 - 32:13)
Pokemon for Pokemon the week could you (32:11 - 32:15)
guys do chatot it's my favorite Pokemon (32:13 - 32:17)
and I feel like people forget about it (32:15 - 32:19)
thanks Cole from New Jersey well not (32:17 - 32:21)
this week Cole from New Jersey because (32:19 - 32:23)
I've already got I already told the (32:21 - 32:24)
people from slack a different pokemon (32:23 - 32:28)
this is josh the gimmick Pokemon uh this (32:24 - 32:29)
is the problem with Pokemon of the week (32:28 - 32:31)
because then people want people want (32:29 - 32:33)
competitive stuff so we incorporated (32:31 - 32:34)
them Pokemon the week but then we miss (32:33 - 32:36)
out on pokemon that aren't competitive (32:34 - 32:39)
is if we do something like farfetch (32:36 - 32:41)
people are like well yeah you gave me a (32:39 - 32:43)
move set but i'm still not gonna use it (32:41 - 32:46)
to never it's a never what neverending (32:43 - 32:48)
story is that we're gonna say it's a (32:46 - 32:50)
catch-22 maybe i don't think it's a (32:48 - 32:52)
really good application of that but yeah (32:50 - 32:54)
it's a catch-22 might be a good phrase (32:52 - 32:57)
to use and i love how chatot can never (32:54 - 33:00)
be a competitive Pokemon because any (32:57 - 33:03)
time by water could appear no because (33:00 - 33:07)
it's uh because of its a signature move (33:03 - 33:10)
it can never be used in competitive (33:07 - 33:12)
Pokemon yeah that's what I'm saying by (33:10 - 33:15)
law well not by law of the United States (33:12 - 33:18)
by law of the Pokemon lawmakers it's (33:15 - 33:20)
still a law in my book in my law book (33:18 - 33:23)
alright Brandon writes in from Missouri (33:20 - 33:26)
hey Pokemon podcast crew I started (33:23 - 33:30)
listening around the episode titled SBJ (33:26 - 33:32)
verse the snowstorm I can't remember (33:30 - 33:34)
what episode that is but that's where an (33:32 - 33:36)
ice that's when I started my question is (33:34 - 33:40)
mainly for will will why won't you play (33:36 - 33:42)
zelda let's take breath of the wild in (33:40 - 33:45)
the packs episode you said that there (33:42 - 33:47)
are three Game three things that game (33:45 - 33:49)
needs for you to play one you need to (33:47 - 33:52)
collect things you can collect 120 (33:49 - 33:55)
spirit orbs and Zelda to their needs (33:52 - 33:58)
be cute things there are foxes and dogs (33:55 - 34:00)
in zelda and they are very cute how cute (33:58 - 34:02)
the foxes are have stopped me from (34:00 - 34:04)
killing them for multiple food items (34:02 - 34:06)
three you need roll things you can roll (34:04 - 34:09)
boulders and you can roll up snowballs I (34:06 - 34:11)
still need an argument for number three (34:09 - 34:14)
on Fire Emblem but just you wait Travis (34:11 - 34:17)
is my favorite Thank You Brad I like how (34:14 - 34:19)
he just complains about women like (34:17 - 34:22)
chimes and have sniffing I don't and I'm (34:19 - 34:23)
the one who's the most vocal about not (34:22 - 34:26)
liking Zelda thank you brandon from (34:24 - 34:29)
Missouri so there you go will it has the (34:26 - 34:31)
three things you you look for in a game (34:29 - 34:34)
except that I will very much disagree (34:31 - 34:40)
that I I suppose potentially the only (34:34 - 34:44)
zelda game that i might say had cuteness (34:40 - 34:47)
as a possibility was wind waker cuz (34:44 - 34:49)
those are very chibi looking characters (34:47 - 34:52)
there's nothing cute about the art style (34:49 - 34:55)
of breath of the wild it's like you mean (34:52 - 34:58)
I I mean go up to I haven't played it by (34:55 - 35:00)
have you seen the gift of the person who (34:58 - 35:02)
goes up and up to the dog and then spins (35:00 - 35:04)
around and then the dog spinning around (35:02 - 35:07)
and chasing tail too mmm yes that's (35:04 - 35:10)
right that I played that you'd the foxes (35:07 - 35:12)
are really cute yet that is a cute thing (35:10 - 35:15)
that people can do look at the art style (35:12 - 35:18)
right you don't look at a Monet and you (35:15 - 35:21)
say wow those are some cute water lilies (35:18 - 35:24)
yes it's beautiful it's painted very (35:21 - 35:28)
well but it's not cute so yes we can (35:24 - 35:32)
destiny cute how is destiny q hey (35:28 - 35:35)
destiny is the aberration because it was (35:32 - 35:37)
an opportunity when I had mono to play (35:35 - 35:41)
games with my friends so I mean (35:37 - 35:45)
obviously I dropped squ like oh there's (35:41 - 35:47)
some cute outfits and destiny mmm (35:45 - 35:52)
wilwood wilwood multiple times tell me (35:47 - 35:54)
how cute his guardian looked well but (35:52 - 35:57)
yeah because I built that Guardian (35:54 - 35:59)
there's obviously like bare hands (35:57 - 36:03)
there's also like 900 core ox seeds or (35:59 - 36:05)
whatever they're called in Zelda and (36:03 - 36:08)
every time you discover one you get one (36:05 - 36:08)
of the cute little (36:08 - 36:11)
like woodland creatures that pop out and (36:08 - 36:16)
goes Wow you from me ya know there's 900 (36:11 - 36:18)
those well that's a lot to collect (36:16 - 36:20)
that's not cute to kind of cute i'm (36:18 - 36:23)
looking for other pretty cute chibi i'm (36:20 - 36:26)
looking for big anime eyes and cheeks (36:23 - 36:29)
and just like that kind of cute or or (36:26 - 36:31)
look what's your favorite of the cousins (36:29 - 36:35)
from we love Katamari no i only love the (36:31 - 36:38)
prince I'm interesting the princess is (36:35 - 36:41)
what what I most identify with so I like (36:38 - 36:44)
beyond beyond is what are you guys uh (36:41 - 36:46)
you mean one of the cousins his name (36:44 - 36:50)
beyond yeah I don't know I do the one (36:46 - 36:51)
that's sort of like Beijing as a very (36:50 - 36:54)
long neck I yeah I'm not that familiar (36:51 - 36:56)
with the cousins but I'll tell you this (36:54 - 36:58)
if you have twitter if you are some one (36:56 - 37:00)
of those people out there few left that (36:58 - 37:02)
have twitter account there is literally (37:00 - 37:05)
a twitter account that is the katamari (37:02 - 37:09)
items list and they tweet like two or (37:05 - 37:11)
three items from that you can pick up in (37:09 - 37:16)
katamari every day it's fantastic can (37:11 - 37:18)
adjust our chat it's called that the (37:16 - 37:21)
cousin is called beyond and i think the (37:18 - 37:23)
the twitter account is i think it might (37:21 - 37:26)
be called katamari items there's some (37:23 - 37:28)
weird up in the game yeah yeah there is (37:26 - 37:30)
and the descriptions of them are really (37:28 - 37:33)
like funny so and you never really pay (37:30 - 37:35)
attention to the descriptions of the (37:33 - 37:36)
individual items while you're playing (37:35 - 37:38)
the game so it's an opportunity to (37:36 - 37:40)
reflect on your past experience but I (37:38 - 37:42)
mean I don't hate Zelda my real problem (37:40 - 37:47)
with Zelda is that it's very like boring (37:42 - 37:49)
a bad well that's part of it but I and I (37:47 - 37:51)
hope and I know breath of the wild is a (37:49 - 37:53)
break away from this but it's very (37:51 - 37:57)
formulaic of you need to follow a (37:53 - 38:00)
particular path and achieve this final (37:57 - 38:04)
goal so as someone who i'm familiar with (38:00 - 38:08)
once ranted and raved about it's not (38:04 - 38:11)
really my story it's you know the story (38:08 - 38:13)
of the game and then it's a put away (38:11 - 38:15)
game once you've completed it you know (38:13 - 38:17)
you put it away and you're not as the (38:15 - 38:20)
only one who's played breath of the wild (38:17 - 38:22)
you can do whatever you (38:20 - 38:26)
on that game there is no lineage to it (38:22 - 38:29)
so but when you do whatever you want do (38:26 - 38:31)
you actually feel like you're making (38:29 - 38:35)
progress yes in any way yeah so bored (38:31 - 38:37)
let's go to the next thing settle down (38:35 - 38:41)
Travis so yeah there are there are 120 (38:37 - 38:43)
shrines every time you complete for (38:41 - 38:46)
shrines you can cash that in for a heart (38:43 - 38:49)
to increase your life or you can cash (38:46 - 38:52)
that enforced animal stamina to increase (38:49 - 38:56)
your climbing or you're running and what (38:52 - 38:59)
I did is I fully upgraded my Stan Emma (38:56 - 39:03)
first so that maxes out I think at like (38:59 - 39:05)
40 shrine like you would have to do like (39:03 - 39:07)
40 shrines or something like that to max (39:05 - 39:09)
it i'm off i know my i know the numbers (39:07 - 39:10)
not right you don't need to send in the (39:09 - 39:12)
correction for that but just like like (39:10 - 39:16)
40 or 50 shrines so i threw out the 50 (39:12 - 39:18)
hours it took me to get there still had (39:16 - 39:21)
three hearts because i thought running (39:18 - 39:25)
and climbing were more important and to (39:21 - 39:28)
me the best part about the game was (39:25 - 39:31)
finding more shrines because every time (39:28 - 39:32)
you go into a shrine it's a different (39:31 - 39:35)
puzzle and they're like really short (39:32 - 39:38)
puzzles where in Zelda's before there (39:35 - 39:41)
would be dungeons and those dungeons (39:38 - 39:43)
would be multiple puzzles of like okay (39:41 - 39:44)
first you got to get the map then you (39:43 - 39:46)
got to get the compass then you got to (39:44 - 39:47)
get all the keys and eventually you get (39:46 - 39:49)
the Bosque and then you fight the boss (39:47 - 39:51)
but in breadth of the wild every time (39:49 - 39:53)
you go into a shrine you're like okay (39:51 - 39:55)
there's one goal here how do I figure (39:53 - 39:57)
that out and you can do any shrine in (39:55 - 40:00)
any order besides the first like four (39:57 - 40:01)
shrines because they teach you how to (40:00 - 40:03)
use items but after the first four (40:01 - 40:05)
strides you knew any shrine you want (40:03 - 40:08)
you'll always have all the tools to do (40:05 - 40:10)
you any shrimp any shrine it's just some (40:08 - 40:12)
might be more difficult or some you (40:10 - 40:14)
might have to come back to but just like (40:12 - 40:15)
running around and exploring those (40:14 - 40:18)
shrines I think is the best part and you (40:15 - 40:20)
can from the start of the game go (40:18 - 40:22)
besides the first four shrines because (40:20 - 40:23)
you need to get your items you go (40:22 - 40:26)
straight to ganon and Kilgannon or you (40:23 - 40:28)
can go and do the four quote-unquote (40:26 - 40:32)
dungeons and they will line up laser so (40:28 - 40:35)
when you do get again and it helps you (40:32 - 40:36)
defeat Ganon (40:35 - 40:38)
but you could literally walked again (40:36 - 40:40)
within the first hour of the game and (40:38 - 40:42)
just attempt to kill Gannon thanks for (40:40 - 40:46)
the spoilers his mission it's like once (40:42 - 40:51)
once i get all 120 shrines they they (40:46 - 40:54)
don't reset there are shrines that do (40:51 - 40:56)
reset so like there are challenged (40:54 - 40:58)
shrines where you walk in and the goal (40:56 - 41:00)
is to like defeat something in a (40:58 - 41:02)
strategic way and those risks there's (41:00 - 41:03)
something called the Blood Moon and like (41:02 - 41:05)
every 30 days in the game which i think (41:03 - 41:07)
is maybe like two hours or three hours (41:05 - 41:09)
of play time the Blood Moon comes and (41:07 - 41:11)
resets all the enemies on the map and (41:09 - 41:13)
that sounds like tedious but it's not (41:11 - 41:15)
because you're traveling so much and you (41:13 - 41:18)
can run past enemies or or like when you (41:15 - 41:19)
go into a shrine it's like okay cool (41:18 - 41:20)
those enemies that had really great (41:19 - 41:22)
weapons respond i can defeat them get (41:20 - 41:24)
those weapons but like i said there's (41:22 - 41:26)
900 core exceeds and that's also fun (41:24 - 41:28)
because when you look at them when you (41:26 - 41:30)
go out and you look at the map and you (41:28 - 41:32)
see all of the shrines you see like (41:30 - 41:34)
these gaps on the map between shrines (41:32 - 41:35)
and you're like oh that has to be (41:34 - 41:37)
something there and they're almost (41:35 - 41:40)
always is like the thing isla i'm not a (41:37 - 41:42)
big zelda fan at all i like I've played (41:40 - 41:43)
a lot of the Zelda games and I've (41:42 - 41:45)
completed a lot of the Zelda games but (41:43 - 41:47)
I'm in the I'm in the camp where like I (41:45 - 41:49)
don't come to Zelda for the story the (41:47 - 41:51)
story is always the same you're saving (41:49 - 41:52)
Princess Zelda you're killing Gannon (41:51 - 41:54)
there's probably a master sword at some (41:52 - 41:56)
point there's probably a horse at some (41:54 - 41:59)
point you get a bow and arrow like it's (41:56 - 42:01)
the same in that aspect it's just they (41:59 - 42:03)
tell it a little differently every time (42:01 - 42:05)
which is fine I'm a big advocate of (42:03 - 42:08)
games that respect your time and I think (42:05 - 42:11)
Zelda does that really well so like if (42:08 - 42:13)
you see something the distance and you (42:11 - 42:15)
decide like I want to see I want to see (42:13 - 42:17)
what's on top of that mountain and you (42:15 - 42:19)
spend 20 minutes climbing this mountain (42:17 - 42:22)
because it's raining or or like you (42:19 - 42:23)
slipped and fell and you had to wreak (42:22 - 42:25)
lime so like when you get to that top of (42:23 - 42:26)
the mountain there will be something (42:25 - 42:30)
there and it every time I wonder what's (42:26 - 42:32)
on the other side of this hill oh cool (42:30 - 42:34)
there's something here oh I wonder (42:32 - 42:35)
what's at the end of this valley oh (42:34 - 42:37)
there's something there and whether (42:35 - 42:39)
that's a shrine or cork seed or a (42:37 - 42:40)
treasure chest or something it just (42:39 - 42:42)
feels like everything you do in Zelda is (42:40 - 42:44)
just oh there's something here and this (42:42 - 42:48)
was an experience getting to and still (42:44 - 42:49)
not interested but I do want people to (42:48 - 42:50)
note (42:49 - 42:53)
how angry Travis was and how passive I (42:50 - 42:57)
was the long con here Zelda's good (42:53 - 43:01)
Gabriel writes in and says hello spj (42:57 - 43:05)
Travis will Micah Irene Logan Greg Erin (43:01 - 43:09)

gloomy Monday mornings anyways I have a (43:33 - 43:38)
question about your mythical podcast (43:36 - 43:41)
Wendy why did you decide to use dungeons (43:38 - 43:44)
and dragons as a tabletop game after a (43:41 - 43:46)
while listening to it to your D&D (43:44 - 43:48)
podcast I felt my own motivation to get (43:46 - 43:50)
my pokey friends together and start a (43:48 - 43:53)
campaign on my own pee goes on and says (43:50 - 43:56)

you greg has fantasized of being able to (44:23 - 44:33)
play a Pokemon game D&D game set in the (44:27 - 44:35)
Pokemon universe for an incredibly long (44:33 - 44:39)
time and convinced Steve to do it on our (44:35 - 44:42)
pokemon podcast that's the part I forgot (44:39 - 44:46)

Greg can be very persuasive yeah I don't (44:46 - 44:50)
know I don't know how that came about (44:49 - 44:53)
yeah no way it was it was mostly it was (44:50 - 44:57)
mostly Greg creating a world in a (44:53 - 45:00)
universe in Indian d fifth edition I (44:57 - 45:03)
never played D&D prior to that point (45:00 - 45:08)
Logan and travis has of course I think (45:03 - 45:10)
it was just like another side project (45:08 - 45:12)
where I was okay we could turn this into (45:10 - 45:14)
a podcast I would like to do another (45:12 - 45:17)
podcast because that would that would (45:14 - 45:21)
hopefully expand the audience we might (45:17 - 45:22)
have started it before sun and moon was (45:21 - 45:25)
announced so that probably helped to (45:22 - 45:27)
like oh there's really nothing to report (45:25 - 45:29)
on I don't remember the times actually (45:27 - 45:33)
anymore but as as for like the the rules (45:29 - 45:35)
and stuff that that was all Greg and I (45:33 - 45:38)
think I don't want to speak for Greg but (45:35 - 45:42)
he was very dedicated to his own rule (45:38 - 45:45)
set and creating those rules and that (45:42 - 45:48)
universe and that story and I have a lot (45:45 - 45:51)
of respect for that there's there's just (45:48 - 45:53)
something about like creating something (45:51 - 45:55)
from scratch and then running with it as (45:53 - 45:58)
opposed to you know just finding some (45:55 - 46:00)
source material and adapting that and (45:58 - 46:01)
there's nothing there's nothing wrong (46:00 - 46:02)
with that that don't take that as like (46:01 - 46:05)
uh oh you're just using somebody you're (46:02 - 46:08)
using somebody elses system not your own (46:05 - 46:11)
but when Greg approached me with that (46:08 - 46:15)
there was like passion there I women to (46:11 - 46:17)
be a very passionate man yeah I shared a (46:15 - 46:22)
room at the dells yeah and so like when (46:17 - 46:24)
I take on a new project and I don't have (46:22 - 46:26)
a lot of time it's like okay the people (46:24 - 46:30)
on this project are as passionate as as (46:26 - 46:34)
I am so I feel like this is worth my (46:30 - 46:35)
time and I think it was like obviously (46:34 - 46:38)
people like mythical Scott writes in (46:35 - 46:41)

little bit old but it's from Michael a (47:57 - 48:04)
low SBJ and crew have you all been (48:00 - 48:06)
watching the sun and moon anime lately (48:04 - 48:08)
if so what are your thoughts on it so (48:06 - 48:10)
far I've been loving the animation and (48:08 - 48:11)
expressions of all the characters all (48:10 - 48:13)
the characters have and the slower (48:11 - 48:16)
slice-of-life pace the show goes thanks (48:13 - 48:18)
for the podcast keep up the great work (48:16 - 48:22)
yeah i haven't seen actually i I've seen (48:18 - 48:25)
the first two episodes but also have (48:22 - 48:28)
recently decided to disconnect all cable (48:25 - 48:32)
television from my home and and I (48:28 - 48:33)
haven't fully recovered from that yet (48:32 - 48:35)
you know what I recently discovered also (48:33 - 48:37)
is that having cable television is like (48:35 - 48:39)
smoking because now that I don't have it (48:37 - 48:41)
I keep reaching for it and it's not (48:39 - 48:43)
there anymore but you did not efficient (48:41 - 48:46)
view I don't know if I want to spend the (48:43 - 48:48)
money I just I you know they really like (48:46 - 48:49)
the only thing I was watching was (48:48 - 48:53)
Pokemon um but i will say for anybody (48:49 - 48:56)
who is hasn't watched the new season yet (48:53 - 48:59)
the disney XD season keep in mind that (48:56 - 49:02)
they have shifted the focus i will very (48:59 - 49:03)
clearly say this they have shifted the (49:02 - 49:05)
focus of the program to a younger (49:03 - 49:08)
audience so we get younger that was (49:05 - 49:13)
before yes yeah um so the actions and (49:08 - 49:17)
the way that ash now acts is is geared (49:13 - 49:19)
towards a i will say five to ten year (49:17 - 49:23)
old uh audience rather than a 10 to 15 (49:19 - 49:26)
year old audience so take take that with (49:23 - 49:29)
you when you watch it and understand (49:26 - 49:33)
that's why he's so much goofier like and (49:29 - 49:35)
and it's it's just like it's become (49:33 - 49:39)
weird i think it fits his character more (49:35 - 49:43)
to that this that (49:39 - 49:46)
the changing that sorted the target (49:43 - 49:48)
audience a little bit and shifting it a (49:46 - 49:51)
little younger I think fits Who ash is (49:48 - 49:54)
better and I'm stealing this from Carly (49:51 - 49:56)
who I was watching it with but she was (49:54 - 50:01)
saying like ashes always like sort of a (49:56 - 50:04)
kind of yeli goofball and in every (50:01 - 50:08)
situation to you on this podcast in some (50:04 - 50:14)
of the like yeah yeah sure and in some (50:08 - 50:16)
of the seasons where they tried to be a (50:14 - 50:21)
little edgier or push the demographic a (50:16 - 50:25)
little higher the main character kind of (50:21 - 50:28)
felt like he didn't belong and (50:25 - 50:28)
that's not really the case here he feels (50:29 - 50:35)
goofy and he's in a really bright sunny (50:32 - 50:41)
silly world I've been watching the (50:35 - 50:43)
subtitled (50:41 - 50:45)
japanese episode so I haven't seen like (50:43 - 50:47)
the the dub but I'm almost caught up on (50:45 - 50:49)
the Japanese episodes and i will say (50:47 - 50:55)
that a bee where is incredible in the (50:49 - 50:58)
anime and I kind of like that Pokemon to (50:55 - 51:00)
start with but now I definitely like (50:58 - 51:03)
beware yeah that first interaction (51:00 - 51:07)
between ash and beware is hilarious yeah (51:03 - 51:10)
Sam rights in from Santa Clara (51:07 - 51:12)
California (51:10 - 51:13)
I've been wanting to write in for a (51:12 - 51:16)
while I'm so glad i stumbled across ISC (51:13 - 51:18)
last year I look forward to every (51:16 - 51:21)
episode and wish I knew about icic and (51:18 - 51:23)
podcast sooner or I wouldn't have (51:21 - 51:25)
dropped off during black and white and I (51:23 - 51:27)
keep trying to play black and white too (51:25 - 51:29)
but now it's been spoiled rotten by (51:27 - 51:31)
better graphics and with no nostalgia (51:29 - 51:34)
attachment I find black and to black and (51:31 - 51:37)
white too hard to play hard to play when (51:34 - 51:39)
it came out to I know it's well she was (51:37 - 51:43)
yeah can he can he give me a pointer (51:39 - 51:47)
wanted to say that Pokemon stars sounds (51:43 - 51:50)
so lame Pokemon Eclipse would be such a (51:47 - 51:52)
better name for a third game in the (51:50 - 51:55)
series I live in socal so that's what (51:52 - 51:59)
the kids call it socal and west coast (51:55 - 52:01)
doesn't get a lot of love have you guys (51:59 - 52:03)
ever thought about something like anime (52:01 - 52:08)
expo or kamikaze it maybe it's kamikaze (52:03 - 52:11)
Co mi yeah oh I got Stan Lee's Comikaze (52:08 - 52:14)
yeah yeah I get it PS i like all of you (52:11 - 52:16)
equally but Chikorita is the best (52:14 - 52:21)
starter Sam you're talking to so two of (52:16 - 52:23)
the people on this podcast live in (52:21 - 52:26)
states that everyone calls flyover (52:23 - 52:29)
States so when you say the west coast (52:26 - 52:31)
doesn't get a lot of love you're not (52:29 - 52:34)
gonna get too much sympathy from Steve (52:31 - 52:38)
and I well I mean I believe steve has (52:34 - 52:43)
been to California uh yeah and how many (52:38 - 52:45)
times have you been to New York once (52:43 - 52:48)
there you go who's getting the love here (52:45 - 52:50)
I'm (52:48 - 52:52)
you into DC I've been de I've I've (52:50 - 52:56)
visited you in DC yeah that you have but (52:52 - 52:57)
you're an East Coaster I mean you're in (52:56 - 53:02)
the eastern time zone so East Coast sure (52:57 - 53:02)
are you on a coat are you near a house (53:02 - 53:09)
I'm also yes but not are you honest (53:05 - 53:11)
you're talking about i'm on RT 0 (53:09 - 53:15)
asymmetric nope i'm on the yeah I guess (53:11 - 53:19)
I'm on Lake Michigan's East Coast you (53:15 - 53:22)
are on a coast and you are in the (53:19 - 53:23)
eastern time zone you're an East Coaster (53:22 - 53:28)
i think i am also the Western Muskegon (53:23 - 53:29)
Michigan where I live right now might be (53:28 - 53:32)
one of thinking might be I don't know (53:29 - 53:33)
there's probably some points in the (53:32 - 53:34)
Upper Peninsula of Michigan that are (53:33 - 53:36)
farther west that are in the eastern (53:34 - 53:40)
time zone but I am near the most west (53:36 - 53:42)
you can be and still be in the eastern (53:40 - 53:45)
time zone like I would absolutely go to (53:42 - 53:48)
a convention in California if that (53:45 - 53:50)
convention would would like have me (53:48 - 53:52)
right ok yeah i'll apply and get in or I (53:50 - 53:56)
think the hard part comes of what to say (53:52 - 53:57)
at a convention right because you're (53:56 - 53:59)
getting so many people that don't know (53:57 - 54:03)
you you have to put on a show that's (53:59 - 54:07)
more generalized otherwise otherwise (54:03 - 54:08)
you're not going to get an audience so (54:07 - 54:11)
that's kind of hard and it's also kind (54:08 - 54:14)
of hard to do it solo which is which was (54:11 - 54:16)
like why PAX East was so nice because (54:14 - 54:19)
because you you two were there and so it (54:16 - 54:22)
was very like when when we read those (54:19 - 54:25)
questions it wasn't just one person (54:22 - 54:26)
reading a question and then just getting (54:25 - 54:29)
that one person's opinion it was uh (54:26 - 54:32)
multiple and obviously you guys are very (54:29 - 54:34)
different when it comes to liking and (54:32 - 54:36)
disliking certain things compared to me (54:34 - 54:38)
so I think that like how black and white (54:36 - 54:41)
2 is bad ya know will we agree there (54:38 - 54:45)
definitely oh no we don't we all agree (54:41 - 54:47)
you heard it here first all three of us (54:45 - 54:49)
black and white too bad but yeah I don't (54:47 - 54:51)
it's not bad but it is in the lower (54:49 - 54:55)
strata like it's oh good god there (54:51 - 54:57)
aren't a lot of Pokemon games I like (54:55 - 55:00)
less than a nun black and white too I (54:57 - 55:03)
resolve for 2017 not to argue about (55:00 - 55:05)
pokemon black and white to any more so (55:03 - 55:10)
yeah hahahaha fair enough I guess you're (55:05 - 55:12)
overruled I guess you're not even (55:10 - 55:14)
participating so black and white 2 is (55:12 - 55:16)
just really bad anyways to provide real (55:14 - 55:18)
content I may be going to the boosh (55:16 - 55:22)
erode grand festival in a long beach in (55:18 - 55:24)
the fourth of July around fourth of July (55:22 - 55:27)
weekend so that may be your opportunity (55:24 - 55:31)
to hang out I might do a meetup if I go (55:27 - 55:34)
there chikorita is is not that great of (55:31 - 55:35)
a starter but I'm glad it's your (55:34 - 55:37)
favorite it's no totodile I'll tell you (55:35 - 55:40)
that I liked Rick areata the totodile is (55:37 - 55:43)
so great yeah chikorita is cute just (55:40 - 55:45)
don't evolve it you know (55:43 - 55:48)
they're all fine (55:45 - 55:50)
that whole Lyons just is they're fine (55:48 - 55:53)
they're cute and fine i will do one more (55:50 - 55:55)
email also emails a little bit old but (55:53 - 55:58)
that's irrelevant Michael rights in hey (55:55 - 56:01)
guys the the only Michael from Florida (55:58 - 56:04)
writing in it's good to know i used to (56:01 - 56:06)
be from indiana and i feel like i have (56:04 - 56:07)
to include this now because we'll (56:06 - 56:10)
mention how cute boys from indiana are (56:07 - 56:12)
if you're not in indiana now the (56:10 - 56:16)
illusion is off the apple wait what wait (56:12 - 56:19)
so it's the geography of the man that (56:16 - 56:21)
makes him attractive not necess like I (56:19 - 56:22)
was assuming when I was sort of like (56:21 - 56:24)
agreeing with you it's like oh because (56:22 - 56:28)
they're like you know your typical like (56:24 - 56:30)
cornbread Midwestern like there is it (56:28 - 56:33)
look there that can be but you just mean (56:30 - 56:36)
like you only find people attractive if (56:33 - 56:37)
they are physically within a certain (56:36 - 56:41)
geography yes there's some magic to the (56:37 - 56:43)
state of Indiana that gives just a an (56:41 - 56:45)
extra polish to the gentleman that you (56:43 - 56:47)
can find there before I get to my (56:45 - 56:49)
question I wanted to weigh in on a right (56:47 - 56:52)
sure couple of things that others have (56:49 - 56:53)
wrote in about and that you have (56:52 - 56:56)
discussed licorice is gross in any form (56:53 - 56:59)
yes I cannot pick my favorite out of all (56:56 - 57:01)
of you because like a good pokemon teen (56:59 - 57:03)
you all bring something important to the (57:01 - 57:06)
table oh that was a good analogy my love (57:03 - 57:08)
for each of you is kind of like real (57:06 - 57:11)
life experience share and finally I gave (57:08 - 57:14)
Soylent a try when suj first talked (57:11 - 57:16)
about it and I can verify that it is in (57:14 - 57:19)
fact made out of people that's not true (57:16 - 57:22)
I've been listening to the show since I (57:19 - 57:24)
found the podcast right before the (57:22 - 57:27)
release of x and y I was a mailman at (57:24 - 57:29)
the time I had plenty of time to listen (57:27 - 57:31)
at work and it quickly went back and (57:29 - 57:32)
listened to everything available and (57:31 - 57:35)
haven't stopped since I wanted to ask if (57:32 - 57:37)
any of you have bought the pokemon gold (57:35 - 57:40)
plus and used it yet I know SBJ and will (57:37 - 57:42)
have the Apple watch but I wasn't sure (57:40 - 57:44)
if anyone had experience with the plus (57:42 - 57:47)
at all I was going to purchase one but (57:44 - 57:50)
so far the reviews made it seem so far (57:47 - 57:52)
the reviews i've seen made it look a (57:50 - 57:55)
little less than worth the retail price (57:52 - 57:58)
and if i want and if i wanted to waste (57:55 - 58:01)
$35 on something disappointed I've (57:58 - 58:04)
pay for dinner on a tinder date uh one (58:01 - 58:06)
last thing just for fun if any of you (58:04 - 58:08)
have that has formed into a Pokemon (58:06 - 58:11)
that's not a legendary for the rest of (58:08 - 58:13)
time which would you choose nothing to (58:11 - 58:16)
do with battling or games yeah just (58:13 - 58:17)
which Pokemon would you want to live out (58:16 - 58:19)
for the rest of your days I would (58:17 - 58:21)
definitely pick a cute water pokemon (58:19 - 58:23)
like corsola or star me so I could just (58:21 - 58:25)
be cute and swim around underwater (58:23 - 58:28)
forever no way too many scary things (58:25 - 58:31)
underwater I wrote me anyways thank you (58:28 - 58:33)

person from Indiana who no longer lives (58:59 - 59:07)
in indiana so there you go hmm no (59:01 - 59:08)
legendaries trying to think of what (59:07 - 59:11)
pokemon is the most humanoid so i can (59:08 - 59:15)
just still be a human uh-oh jam I'll (59:11 - 59:18)
just still be a person it's it's so (59:15 - 59:21)
tough if you can't yet lie because I'd (59:18 - 59:26)
want to be Victini but mmm (59:21 - 59:28)
you have a go Steve if I was to pick (59:26 - 59:33)
which Pokemon I would be mmm it would (59:28 - 59:37)
probably be Kyle a head to have to be (59:33 - 59:40)
like a flying Pokemon then I can go (59:37 - 59:42)
around quickly that was gonna be my (59:40 - 59:45)
stool or somebody would levitate oh (59:42 - 59:48)
that's a good one too like Alec I was (59:45 - 59:50)
gonna I was gonna say haunch crow (59:48 - 59:52)
because I mentioned it before that I (59:50 - 59:54)
really like haunch crow and I can fly (59:52 - 59:55)
which would be a really fun thing to do (59:54 - 59:59)
rolling with the hunch rolling with the (59:55 - 60:04)
hunch mmm i'd probably say pijat that's (59:59 - 60:08)
a safe bet it's a strong bird Pokemon (60:04 - 60:10)
because if I was like a talonflame I'd (60:08 - 60:11)
have to worry about being in a tree and (60:10 - 60:16)
catching the tree on fire mmm I'm having (60:11 - 60:19)
a really hard time with this (60:16 - 60:22)
what's the big beldam called wrong song (60:19 - 60:26)
no yeah my bronzong you talking about (60:22 - 60:29)
bronzer bronzing has nothing to do with (60:26 - 60:33)
Bill dumb beldam metagross metagross (60:29 - 60:36)
that I'll be a metagross there you go (60:33 - 60:38)
they're real smart they float around (60:36 - 60:41)
they got psychic powers and their steel (60:38 - 60:44)
type if I can't be a legend Terry let me (60:41 - 60:46)
be a metagross put that on my tombstone (60:44 - 60:53)
ah going back to the Pokemon goplus to (60:46 - 60:55)
answer that question I have it I've had (60:53 - 60:58)
it since day one whenever it came out I (60:55 - 61:01)
know it's not worth the $35 it somehow (60:58 - 61:03)
burned through a hundred of my pokeballs (61:01 - 61:06)
in 20 minutes and caught only four (61:03 - 61:08)
things and it definitely worked at one (61:06 - 61:10)
point in time but then it stopped (61:08 - 61:12)
working here's the problem with Pokemon (61:10 - 61:15)
go plus it only works in a situation (61:12 - 61:19)
like it works the best in a situation (61:15 - 61:22)
where you know you're not going to be (61:19 - 61:25)
looking at your phone and you're walking (61:22 - 61:28)
so for like me (61:25 - 61:31)
I'm never walking like I walk two (61:28 - 61:34)
minutes to my car I get into my car i (61:31 - 61:37)
drive to work which is a half hour and (61:34 - 61:42)
then I sit in my office for seven hours (61:37 - 61:45)
and then I go home and I don't leave my (61:42 - 61:47)
house so in situations where i was (61:45 - 61:50)
walking like i'm going to the mall uh (61:47 - 61:54)
and i'm gonna do some shopping i would (61:50 - 61:56)
have my phone out anyways because the (61:54 - 62:00)
mall has polka stops and pokemon and (61:56 - 62:03)
that is a like yes i'm walking but (62:00 - 62:05)
that's also an opportunity for me put to (62:03 - 62:08)
play pokemon go so why would I turn on (62:05 - 62:12)
the the device when like (62:08 - 62:14)
a benefit of going to the mall is to (62:12 - 62:15)
play pokemon go especially like (62:14 - 62:19)
Wisconsin where it's freezing outside so (62:15 - 62:21)
the only time I can really play pokemon (62:19 - 62:24)
Go Go is at a place that's indoor and (62:21 - 62:26)
has polka stops and that's the same as (62:24 - 62:28)
going to like a park like I'm going to a (62:26 - 62:30)
park I know I'm going to be doing a lot (62:28 - 62:32)
of walking but i also know because it's (62:30 - 62:33)
a park there's gonna be a bunch of polka (62:32 - 62:35)
stops and i'm going to spin those and (62:33 - 62:36)
i'm going to call it the pokemon because (62:35 - 62:39)
the problem not if the Milwaukee Council (62:36 - 62:41)
has its way that Milwaukee has anything (62:39 - 62:44)
to say about it I have never seen the (62:41 - 62:48)
Pokemon go plus catch anything rare like (62:44 - 62:50)
it's really good at getting piggies and (62:48 - 62:53)
rats has and zoo bats and drowsies but (62:50 - 62:55)
I've never seen it catch like a (62:53 - 62:59)
pidgeotto or a Kadabra or just like I'm (62:55 - 63:02)
not saying it needs to catch a Charizard (62:59 - 63:04)
it doesn't and maybe I'm wrong about (63:02 - 63:06)
that but like I don't know it just like (63:04 - 63:08)
it just seems like every situation where (63:06 - 63:09)
you would be like okay I'm going to go (63:08 - 63:11)
for a walk and I'm going to turn on this (63:09 - 63:13)
pokemon google+ at the same time like (63:11 - 63:14)
you're going for a walk and especially (63:13 - 63:16)
if you're by yourself you're probably (63:14 - 63:18)
going to have your phone out anyways if (63:16 - 63:20)
you're really into Pokemon go you're (63:18 - 63:22)
going to have your phone out to play (63:20 - 63:23)
pokemon go because you know you're (63:22 - 63:26)
walking in a situation where you can (63:23 - 63:28)
play pokemon go like the only way it (63:26 - 63:29)
would benefit you is if you're like (63:28 - 63:31)
really in the hatching eggs and you're (63:29 - 63:33)
not interested in catching pokemon and (63:31 - 63:36)
spinning stops like that like the device (63:33 - 63:39)
will spin stops for you and we'll catch (63:36 - 63:42)
like basic pokemon if you're in an area (63:39 - 63:45)
and you're like you can pretty but (63:42 - 63:47)
pretty quickly figure out how many stops (63:45 - 63:48)
are in an area just by loading the app (63:47 - 63:50)
up once and you would have to do that (63:48 - 63:53)
anyways to start the to start the device (63:50 - 63:56)
i don't think it's worth it but i've (63:53 - 63:59)
tried to save you $35 probably better (63:56 - 64:03)
off to spending thirty five dollars on (63:59 - 64:03)
incubators yeah I'd say yeah if it does (64:03 - 64:07)
you want to be able to hatch Pokemon (64:05 - 64:12)
better just by a map that am i buy more (64:07 - 64:15)
occupation of incubators but you know I (64:12 - 64:18)
name is Michael consolidate five dollars (64:15 - 64:20)
to take me on a date okay that's be (64:18 - 64:22)
disappointed it's a better better better (64:20 - 64:25)
use of the 35 hours where you messin you (64:22 - 64:27)
can buy some sick clothes and Pokemon go (64:25 - 64:29)
that doesn't do anything except make you (64:27 - 64:31)
look stylish certainly doesn't cover (64:29 - 64:35)
your ankles that's right that's that's (64:31 - 64:37)
absolutely true oh yeah all you got our (64:35 - 64:39)
leg tubes well that'll wrap it up for (64:37 - 64:42)
emails if you want to send in any emails (64:39 - 64:45)
let me know by sending in those emails (64:42 - 64:51)
SBJ at pkmn cast com or Pokemon podcast (64:45 - 64:55)
calm / contact travis once you give us (64:51 - 64:59)
our pokemon of the week oh I am really (64:55 - 65:02)
excited for this because a Pokemon of (64:59 - 65:05)
the week is drifblim I'm excited for (65:02 - 65:08)
this for more than one reason first (65:05 - 65:12)
drifblim is just really cool I've always (65:08 - 65:16)
liked the Pokemon it was on the terrible (65:12 - 65:19)
awful unequivocally objectively terrible (65:16 - 65:23)
featured team that I submitted wet way (65:19 - 65:25)
back before I was on the show when I was (65:23 - 65:27)
just a rabid fan I included drifblim (65:25 - 65:30)
because I love drifblim very good very (65:27 - 65:34)
cool very awesome second what is (65:30 - 65:37)
happening with drifblim right now is one (65:34 - 65:41)
of the things that makes competitive (65:37 - 65:44)
Pokemon interesting to me which is when (65:41 - 65:49)
out of nowhere kind of people realize oh (65:44 - 65:55)
wait this pokemon that no one is using (65:49 - 65:58)
actually might be good and to give you (65:55 - 66:02)
an example (65:58 - 66:06)
according to smog ins raid smog ons (66:02 - 66:12)
usage statistics in January drifblim was (66:06 - 66:18)
on point zero four percent of teams (66:12 - 66:22)
though not a lot of usage as of februari (66:18 - 66:27)
2017 drifblim is on 4.0 four percent of (66:22 - 66:31)
teams so that's an increase of over (66:27 - 66:35)
1,000 percent and you might be thinking (66:31 - 66:41)
what happened why the big change a new (66:35 - 66:45)
item in well a new set of items rather (66:41 - 66:50)
in Pokemon Sun and Moon are the terrain (66:45 - 66:52)
seeds so there's like electric seed (66:50 - 66:55)
misty seed psychic seed grassy seed I (66:52 - 66:57)
think they we talked about this last (66:55 - 67:00)
week yeah so you're sending a Pokemon (66:57 - 67:03)
and well I guess anytime the terrain (67:00 - 67:06)
changes to electric misty grassy psychic (67:03 - 67:08)
depending on which of the seeds you're (67:06 - 67:11)
using terrain then that seed will be (67:08 - 67:13)
consumed it will increase one of the (67:11 - 67:15)
stats of it'll in the case of like Miss (67:13 - 67:17)
teacher I think they might all increase (67:15 - 67:19)
their defense actually the defense of (67:17 - 67:22)
that pokemon x one stage all of these (67:19 - 67:24)
items Electric seed grassy seed etc (67:22 - 67:27)
increase the defense of the holder and (67:24 - 67:29)
then they're consumed when the (67:27 - 67:33)
respective terrain is activated and you (67:29 - 67:34)
might be hearing that and thinking what (67:33 - 67:36)
on earth does this have to do with (67:34 - 67:38)
drifblim well one of drift limbs (67:36 - 67:41)
abilities is the ability unburden (67:38 - 67:43)
there's an ability where its speed is (67:41 - 67:48)
doubled once if it at one point had a (67:43 - 67:50)
held item but then that held item was (67:48 - 67:52)
either consumed or taken away from it (67:50 - 67:54)
it's not there anymore so it can't be (67:52 - 67:56)
like you just don't send it in with an (67:54 - 67:58)
item this ability only activates if it (67:56 - 67:59)
had an item and it was either taken away (67:58 - 68:02)
or consumed its speed will be doubled so (67:59 - 68:05)
not only this drifblim come in with a (68:02 - 68:08)
boost to its defense it also has twice (68:05 - 68:10)
the speed (68:08 - 68:12)
it would normally have it has access to (68:10 - 68:14)
some pretty powerful support moves stuff (68:12 - 68:18)
like tailwind will-o'-wisp uh and then (68:14 - 68:20)
it you can do cheesy stuff with like (68:18 - 68:23)
acrobatics because you don't have an (68:20 - 68:25)
item anymore so acrobatics power is (68:23 - 68:28)
increased a lot and it just ends up (68:25 - 68:32)
being pretty good and people it took a (68:28 - 68:34)
while for people to realize that I think (68:32 - 68:36)
mostly just because these items are new (68:34 - 68:38)
and you know takes a while for people to (68:36 - 68:41)
realize really how to utilize it a new (68:38 - 68:45)
item so with all that in mind let's go (68:41 - 68:48)
to our slack channel and see what sets (68:45 - 68:53)
people came up with looks like we've got (68:48 - 68:59)
three the first one from Gabe Brown is (68:53 - 69:01)
close to the set I was just describing (68:59 - 69:04)
earlier this is either psychic seed or (69:01 - 69:06)
misty seed depending on if you are going (69:04 - 69:08)
to be pairing this with top boot lele (69:06 - 69:11)
for psychic terrain or top of Finney for (69:08 - 69:13)
misty terrain the ability is going to (69:11 - 69:16)
unburden the v's are going to be 252 and (69:13 - 69:19)
HP 252 and special defense and 8 and (69:16 - 69:22)
defense with a sassy nature your moves (69:19 - 69:23)
are going to be acrobatics tailwind (69:22 - 69:26)
Shadow Ball and then either protect or (69:23 - 69:28)
disabled I like protect just because (69:26 - 69:32)
protect is very good in doubles and I (69:28 - 69:34)
think I basically already described this (69:32 - 69:36)
tailwind is just incredible at (69:34 - 69:38)
increasing the speed of your team and (69:36 - 69:39)
just being generally supportive (69:38 - 69:42)
acrobatics is going to deal a lot of (69:39 - 69:44)
damage because you don't have an item (69:42 - 69:46)
because you've already consumed your (69:44 - 69:50)
psychic or misty seed even though you're (69:46 - 69:52)
defensively invested he can still deal (69:50 - 69:54)
some damage Shadow Ball is just there (69:52 - 69:56)
because it's a ghost same type attack (69:54 - 70:00)
bonus move and then protect and disabled (69:56 - 70:05)
or other just generally good moves the (70:00 - 70:07)
other two sets are fairly similar and (70:05 - 70:10)
they're actually the oh sorry I guess (70:07 - 70:13)
there's only 10 so we do have a variant (70:10 - 70:18)
that's very similar from Kevin soria (70:13 - 70:21)
frequent that all the actually all these (70:18 - 70:22)
folks today are pretty frequent Pokemon (70:21 - 70:24)
of the contributors (70:22 - 70:26)
so that's the same thing but it's (70:24 - 70:28)
drifblim with citrus Barry can be good (70:26 - 70:32)
too it is more difficult to guarantee (70:28 - 70:34)
you're going to lose your item than it (70:32 - 70:35)
is with one of the seeds so it's not (70:34 - 70:38)
doesn't get as much usage but it's still (70:35 - 70:41)
it's still fun and then basically the (70:38 - 70:44)
same set Shadow Ball tailwind disabled (70:41 - 70:47)
and willow wisp swapping out the (70:44 - 70:50)
acrobatics for willow wisp there and (70:47 - 70:52)
then the third set is coming from Casey (70:50 - 70:53)
Ross and this is the one that's (70:52 - 70:56)
different this is this uses the ability (70:53 - 71:00)
flare boost which is an ability I think (70:56 - 71:02)
it's the hidden ability of drifblim (71:00 - 71:09)
which increases the Special Attack of a (71:02 - 71:13)
Pokemon when it's burned and so flame (71:09 - 71:16)
orb is the item here to make it burned (71:13 - 71:19)
and then the EVs are 8 and HP 248 and (71:16 - 71:22)
special attack and 252 and speed with a (71:19 - 71:24)
modest nature you'll notice this is a (71:22 - 71:28)
distinctly offensive drifblim thunder (71:24 - 71:31)
wave hacks thunderbolt and tailwind just (71:28 - 71:33)
because even though it your this one is (71:31 - 71:35)
more offensive tailwind is still just (71:33 - 71:38)
very good so those are the three sets I (71:35 - 71:40)
love it when a pokemon comes out of (71:38 - 71:42)
nowhere to be on people's teams that it (71:40 - 71:44)
wouldn't have otherwise this drifblim (71:42 - 71:46)
example is just a perfect example of (71:44 - 71:48)
that because it took people kind of this (71:46 - 71:51)
long to figure out oh yeah unburden is a (71:48 - 71:57)
thing all done oh yeah sorry he was just (71:51 - 71:59)
caught up in that drifblim wisp (71:57 - 72:02)
wistfulness yeah I was being taken away (71:59 - 72:04)
by drifblim which isn't a very good (72:02 - 72:05)
thing to have happened to you if you (72:04 - 72:07)
read the pokedex oh that's triple and (72:05 - 72:09)
more specifically but you know shiny (72:07 - 72:13)
drifblim is yellow with blue highlights (72:09 - 72:14)
instead of being purple with yellow (72:13 - 72:17)
highlights one of the one of the better (72:14 - 72:20)
shiny is really really cool some trivia (72:17 - 72:22)
here drifblim has the highest HP based (72:20 - 72:25)
at of all flying types and is tied with (72:22 - 72:27)
garrett ena for the highest HP based (72:25 - 72:30)
step of base stat of all ghost-type (72:27 - 72:33)
pokémon drift limandri flume are the (72:30 - 72:35)
only pokemon not introduced in the Hoenn (72:33 - 72:38)
region to be found in the fluctuating (72:35 - 72:39)
perience group I don't know what that is (72:38 - 72:43)
fluctuating fluctuating that anger (72:39 - 72:47)
doesn't say egg plus you fluctuating oh (72:43 - 72:49)
here we go I think I know at this (72:47 - 72:52)
there's no this is it's not like I can (72:49 - 72:55)
click on I think I know what this is so (72:52 - 73:00)
different pokemon have pool boy am i (72:55 - 73:01)

tell one friend about it's super (74:23 - 74:27)
effective that would be awesome can I (74:25 - 74:29)
give you the experience group answer (74:27 - 74:33)
yeah let's hear it the pokemon are (74:29 - 74:35)
assigned essentially a value that (74:33 - 74:37)
determines (74:35 - 74:39)
what amount of experience they need at (74:37 - 74:42)
each level to level up and obviously (74:39 - 74:44)
that number goes up as they tend towards (74:42 - 74:47)
getting leveling up to level 100 right (74:44 - 74:48)
it takes more experience to go from (74:47 - 74:50)
level 99 200 than it does to go from (74:48 - 74:54)
level 1 to 2 and it's not the same (74:50 - 74:56)
increase its not the same rate of (74:54 - 74:59)
