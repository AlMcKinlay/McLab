[Music] (0:02 - 0:14)
[Applause] (0:13 - 0:23)
[Music] (0:14 - 0:26)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:30)
555th episode five five five episode of (0:26 - 0:32)
the Pokemon podcast it's super effective (0:30 - 0:36)
uh I'm your host Steve with me is Hannah (0:32 - 0:39)
uh yeah I'm still here (0:36 - 0:39)
um (0:39 - 0:42)
I don't know I've had a stressful cat (0:39 - 0:44)
week my cat got into a few things that (0:42 - 0:45)
she wasn't supposed to get into and then (0:44 - 0:47)
last night ran into a door as I was (0:45 - 0:50)
closing it so I've just been worried (0:47 - 0:51)
about my cat all week that's pretty much (0:50 - 0:54)
it but she's fine I'm pretty sure I'm (0:51 - 0:55)
pretty certain at this point I have (0:54 - 0:58)
spent multiple nights staying up way too (0:55 - 1:01)
late observing her I think she's fine (0:58 - 1:03)
all right that laugh you heard was Greg (1:01 - 1:05)
he's back rumors of my firing were (1:03 - 1:09)
greatly over exaggerated so those of you (1:05 - 1:12)
in my DMs uh (1:09 - 1:16)
uh it's fine I was on as I had said (1:12 - 1:19)
multiple times leading up to my break on (1:16 - 1:22)
vacation I went to a place (1:19 - 1:25)
for a vacation for the first time in (1:22 - 1:27)
four years and I was there (1:25 - 1:29)
and then I came home (1:27 - 1:32)
yeah and now you're back and now I'm (1:29 - 1:34)
crazy how that works you know (1:32 - 1:37)
it's a thing called vacation (1:34 - 1:40)
I can't wait to take one (1:37 - 1:42)
we can only dream that was (1:40 - 1:46)
a very specification (1:42 - 1:46)
boy that place is expensive (1:48 - 1:53)
so (1:51 - 1:55)
we did a bonus episode last week it was (1:53 - 1:57)
uh myself Hannah and Bobby we just (1:55 - 2:00)
really talked about the uh DLC obviously (1:57 - 2:02)
the Pokemon presents there was a lot to (2:00 - 2:03)
cover (2:02 - 2:05)
um there's there's still a lot to cover (2:03 - 2:09)
uh so Greg's here now (2:05 - 2:11)
um and the game updated to (2:09 - 2:15)
1.2 which it updated the day of the (2:11 - 2:16)
Pokemon presents (2:15 - 2:18)
um and I wanted to talk about it and I (2:16 - 2:20)
wanted and we knew the notes before the (2:18 - 2:22)
game updated uh (2:20 - 2:25)
but I got a bone to pick with these (2:22 - 2:27)
notes (2:25 - 2:27)
because I was particular just the notes (2:27 - 2:32)
not the people that wrote the notes just (2:30 - 2:35)
that yes you notes are poorly organized (2:32 - 2:38)
and poorly worded and I do not care for (2:35 - 2:39)
how you've arranged yourself on the page (2:38 - 2:43)
how dare you dare how dare you put bug (2:39 - 2:46)
fixes there (2:43 - 2:47)
um so what we're gonna do is we're gonna (2:46 - 2:49)
go through the notes uh of what was (2:47 - 2:51)
updated uh there's a new bug I guess (2:49 - 2:53)
that I was debating about talking about (2:51 - 2:56)
I don't want to like fear Monger of like (2:53 - 3:00)
don't play sword and just don't don't (2:56 - 3:04)
[Laughter] (3:00 - 3:06)
slaps (3:04 - 3:08)
back to it because of this bug take take (3:06 - 3:10)
your chances at this point with the (3:08 - 3:13)
little SV because you may never be able (3:10 - 3:16)
to play your game again (3:13 - 3:17)
um (3:16 - 3:19)
and then uh there's a new Pokemon go (3:17 - 3:20)
Community day and we didn't talk about (3:19 - 3:21)
Pokemon sleep so those are the three (3:20 - 3:24)
topics we're gonna do today (3:21 - 3:24)
um (3:24 - 3:27)
uh but let's start with the let's start (3:24 - 3:29)
with the notes let's start with the the (3:27 - 3:30)
the (3:29 - 3:33)
1.2 patch now here (3:30 - 3:35)
okay so uh originally before the patch (3:33 - 3:36)
came out they said that there was some (3:35 - 3:37)
more things they were going to do in the (3:36 - 3:39)
patch that was going to surprise and (3:37 - 3:40)
Delight us or whatever maybe those (3:39 - 3:43)
weren't those exact words but neither it (3:40 - 3:45)
may have surprised us but I highly doubt (3:43 - 3:48)
the Delight part came in (3:45 - 3:48)
um yeah maybe uh okay so (3:49 - 3:56)
uh so the new features added we got (3:53 - 3:58)
three bullet points here I'm (3:56 - 4:00)
unacceptable I want four uh okay so the (3:58 - 4:02)
first thing is they added the uh Hidden (4:00 - 4:05)
Treasures of area zero DLC four part (4:02 - 4:07)
Pokemon scarlet and violet uh games they (4:05 - 4:10)
can be accessed via the main menu (4:07 - 4:12)
um for some reason I gotta say this for (4:10 - 4:14)
some reason when I watched the trailer I (4:12 - 4:16)
thought you bought one and it was for (4:14 - 4:17)
both games (4:16 - 4:19)
but that does not seem to be the case (4:17 - 4:23)
again no you buy one you have to buy you (4:19 - 4:26)
get two different deals but you still (4:23 - 4:27)
have to buy them individually for each (4:26 - 4:30)
game yes they are functionally the same (4:27 - 4:32)
and this was the same for sword and (4:30 - 4:35)
shield it was but for example we're (4:32 - 4:38)
buying the wrong version when I watched (4:35 - 4:40)
the trailers being like oh you can't re (4:38 - 4:42)
you can't return DLC and they were like (4:40 - 4:45)
but I can't I don't know how you buy the (4:42 - 4:47)
wrong version oh it's easy (4:45 - 4:49)
you booked a flight for the complete (4:47 - 4:51)
wrong date so don't even come at me for (4:49 - 4:54)
how do you buy it for the wrong version (4:51 - 4:58)
this podcast is over (4:54 - 4:58)
two and a half weeks off Greg to come (4:59 - 5:04)
back to attack me about the calendars (5:01 - 5:06)
are hard they are not hard they are (5:04 - 5:08)
hard-coded dates it's been that way for (5:06 - 5:10)
1500 years or whatever the current (5:08 - 5:13)
calendar that we're using is in place I (5:10 - 5:15)
don't know Al tell us all about (5:13 - 5:18)
calendars and slack I I had a good time (5:15 - 5:22)
with Nick not going to packs (5:18 - 5:22)
um okay so yeah so the the DLC is there (5:26 - 5:31)
to purchase it's five dollars more (5:29 - 5:32)
expensive I don't know if we talked (5:31 - 5:35)
about that last week but yeah (5:32 - 5:35)
twice (5:36 - 5:40)
and sword and shield was 29.99 this is (5:37 - 5:42)
34.99 (5:40 - 5:44)
um trainers can enjoy online (5:42 - 5:46)
competitions and friendly competitions (5:44 - 5:48)
in the battle Stadium entries are now (5:46 - 5:50)
open for the new (5:48 - 5:54)
online competition paldea prologue so I (5:50 - 5:55)
think (5:54 - 5:58)
the the like 40 people out there that (5:55 - 5:59)
still play single battles and haven't (5:58 - 6:01)
transitioned into double battles because (5:59 - 6:04)
it's too complicated for them uh I think (6:01 - 6:05)
they're happy that you can now have a (6:04 - 6:07)
longer timer in single battles (6:05 - 6:11)
so finally you can do 60 Minutes of (6:07 - 6:13)
Rapid spin spikes (6:11 - 6:16)
is that the new singles meta for this (6:13 - 6:19)
one but it hasn't changed it's always (6:16 - 6:22)
the meta the timer seemed pretty big the (6:19 - 6:24)
people were who do play that format were (6:22 - 6:26)
very excited about they weren't they (6:24 - 6:26)
were (6:26 - 6:29)
finally they can toxic stall even longer (6:26 - 6:33)
that's how you win the dream and then (6:29 - 6:35)
the other new feature they added was (6:33 - 6:37)
players can now connect their games to (6:35 - 6:39)
Pokemon go so this was one of the uh (6:37 - 6:41)
surprise and delights is we have Pokemon (6:39 - 6:42)
go (6:41 - 6:44)
uh compatibility actually we'll get to (6:42 - 6:47)
that but I think that is really cool uh (6:44 - 6:50)
adjustments feature adjustments (6:47 - 6:52)
uh they added functionality to the boxes (6:50 - 6:54)
because they were lacking yeah they (6:52 - 6:56)
didn't do anything they still didn't (6:54 - 6:58)
added Mass release though (6:56 - 7:02)
um from a Pokemon summary players can (6:58 - 7:04)
now change Pokemon nicknames markings (7:02 - 7:06)
held items and Mark or Ribbon related (7:04 - 7:09)
titles as well as reorder moves half (7:06 - 7:11)
Pokemon remember or forget moves and use (7:09 - 7:15)
TMs this in itself great perfect no (7:11 - 7:16)
complaint it's actually a great change (7:15 - 7:19)
it was really weird that you couldn't it (7:16 - 7:20)
was it's weird to say there's a great (7:19 - 7:22)
change because everybody assumed it (7:20 - 7:23)
should have done that from the beginning (7:22 - 7:25)
so we caught up with what everybody (7:23 - 7:28)
wanted so thank you (7:25 - 7:32)
we're back it's not in bug fixes yeah (7:28 - 7:34)
like it felt like that was a bug like (7:32 - 7:37)
hey that was that is a feature gray we (7:34 - 7:39)
are we are blessing you with the ability (7:37 - 7:42)
to change your marks in the box which (7:39 - 7:44)
you could do in past game before well (7:42 - 7:47)
it's a feature now baby not a bug if we (7:44 - 7:50)
don't call it a bug it's not we're gonna (7:47 - 7:52)
charge you an extra five dollars on the (7:50 - 7:55)
DLC for that one or that one oh (7:52 - 7:57)
players can now also swap out held items (7:55 - 7:59)
by pressing the Y button I think old (7:57 - 8:01)
games did this as well but you know (7:59 - 8:03)
that's back (8:01 - 8:05)
players that can now select uh all boxes (8:03 - 8:07)
while moving Pokemon or items in the (8:05 - 8:09)
party box View and hell then views okay (8:07 - 8:11)
that for sure was a thing in old games (8:09 - 8:13)
what you're saying here is you could (8:11 - 8:16)
take like seven Pokemon and then hover (8:13 - 8:19)
over a box and just drop them in uh and (8:16 - 8:21)
that you couldn't do before and you can (8:19 - 8:23)
do it now you could do it in past games (8:21 - 8:25)
that's back (8:23 - 8:27)
uh and then when in battle team view (8:25 - 8:29)
Pokemon in your boxes that are assigned (8:27 - 8:30)
to a battle team will now have their (8:29 - 8:34)
icons displayed in a darker Hue uh if (8:30 - 8:36)
those Pokemon members are in a battle (8:34 - 8:38)
team being currently displayed it's just (8:36 - 8:39)
uh it just changed some color so you (8:38 - 8:41)
know which Pokemon or battle teamed or (8:39 - 8:43)
not (8:41 - 8:43)
um okay some bug fixes there's a lot (8:44 - 8:47)
here (8:46 - 8:50)
debatable if they were fixed or not but (8:47 - 8:52)
uh there was a bug that prevented the (8:50 - 8:54)
opposing Terra Pokemon HP from visually (8:52 - 8:56)
reflecting damage dealt by certain moves (8:54 - 8:58)
such as play run let's just play rough (8:56 - 9:02)
yeah really or damage dealt uh at the (8:58 - 9:04)
same time that a certain status (9:02 - 9:06)
condition is applied I've this actually (9:04 - 9:08)
happened a lot in Greninja where (9:06 - 9:10)
um it would be paralyzed but it would (9:08 - 9:11)
take like a full turn for it to reflect (9:10 - 9:15)
paralysis uh causing the terror uh (9:11 - 9:16)
overall this would cause the Terra (9:15 - 9:19)
Pokemon's HP gauge to fluctuate in an (9:16 - 9:22)
unusual matter this has been fixed (9:19 - 9:23)
um so I think I think it's been pretty (9:22 - 9:25)
confirmed that the that specifically (9:23 - 9:27)
play rough is fixed the first time we (9:25 - 9:28)
heard about the play rough issue was (9:27 - 9:31)
with Charizard yep back in the day (9:28 - 9:33)
um and it was funny because during that (9:31 - 9:34)
time it was like was it huge power was (9:33 - 9:37)
it play rough was it this was it that (9:34 - 9:39)
um and to me it was always it was always (9:37 - 9:41)
play rough because I would see non-huge (9:39 - 9:43)
Power asumerals used play rough and the (9:41 - 9:46)
HP power would one minute it would be (9:43 - 9:48)
five percent the next minute would be 55 (9:46 - 9:50)
percent (9:48 - 9:52)
so that's fixed I guess (9:50 - 9:56)
um azumar all of users out there (9:52 - 9:58)
bring them back bring them all back we (9:56 - 10:01)
need them back in We're Alone (9:58 - 10:03)
here's the thing though that bug didn't (10:01 - 10:05)
stop any assumable user for bringing a (10:03 - 10:08)
zoomeral to array why it's not it's not (10:05 - 10:10)
the player's fault it's the game don't (10:08 - 10:13)
hate the player hate the game (10:10 - 10:15)
there was a bug that caused all Pokemon (10:13 - 10:18)
on your side to feet at once despite the (10:15 - 10:21)
HP indicating that they still have HP (10:18 - 10:24)
this could occur in the black Tara (10:21 - 10:26)
Crystal raids against Pokemon with the (10:24 - 10:29)
mightiest mark this has been fixed uh (10:26 - 10:31)
I've had this happen (10:29 - 10:33)
um not a lot I've had it happen like (10:31 - 10:35)
maybe once or twice during like (10:33 - 10:37)
cinderace but (10:35 - 10:37)
um (10:37 - 10:40)
got to know that was a bug because it (10:37 - 10:42)
was very weird to be like oh oh we're (10:40 - 10:45)
all dead we we I I was watching I was (10:42 - 10:46)
watching health and we were we were (10:45 - 10:48)
looking pretty green and now we're we're (10:46 - 10:51)
looking pretty empty that doesn't make (10:48 - 10:52)
sense (10:51 - 10:54)
and then you you kind of think of like (10:52 - 10:56)
oh did like reflect wear off and then (10:54 - 10:58)
incinerase just happened to crit (10:56 - 11:01)
everyone (10:58 - 11:01)
and hit everybody at the exact same time (11:01 - 11:06)
yeah (11:03 - 11:06)
uh there was a bug that prevented (11:06 - 11:12)
players from entering any input in the (11:08 - 11:12)
game (11:12 - 11:15)
uh that could occur if a terror Pokemon (11:12 - 11:18)
took actions while a player was choosing (11:15 - 11:20)
the target of the move this has been (11:18 - 11:22)
fixed (11:20 - 11:22)
um (11:23 - 11:27)
I disagree with that one but okay (11:24 - 11:30)
errors could occur when some uh someone (11:27 - 11:32)
connecting to a terror array battle saw (11:30 - 11:33)
a different Pokemon displayed on the (11:32 - 11:35)
stream than what the host saw that has (11:33 - 11:38)
been fixed I've never seen that (11:35 - 11:41)
um a bug could occur when a that cause a (11:38 - 11:42)
player joining a terror Raid Battle from (11:41 - 11:45)
the Terra Battle search screen to (11:42 - 11:47)
be brought to a terror a battle against (11:45 - 11:49)
a different Pokemon than they have seen (11:47 - 11:52)
that has been fixed also I've never had (11:49 - 11:53)
that issue is that supposed to be like (11:52 - 11:55)
oh I saw a pin curtain and then all of a (11:53 - 11:57)
sudden I'm fighting a Hydra (11:55 - 11:59)
but I also I've had the thing where I (11:57 - 12:00)
selected I have selected the right (11:59 - 12:02)
Pokemon but the display in the front (12:00 - 12:05)
shows something completely not what I (12:02 - 12:06)
picked (12:05 - 12:08)
I'm like where did that come from and (12:06 - 12:10)
then it goes with the one that I didn't (12:08 - 12:12)
pick that's how I ended up in that one (12:10 - 12:14)
raid with a level 30 pimpole I'm like oh (12:12 - 12:18)
yeah I did not pick this (12:14 - 12:20)
we're gonna make the best of it I guess (12:18 - 12:22)
and then there was a bug that caused (12:20 - 12:23)
Terror Raid Battle crystals to stop (12:22 - 12:25)
appearing for a set amount of time that (12:23 - 12:27)
could occur under certain circumstances (12:25 - 12:30)
that has been fixed (12:27 - 12:33)
um so so going back to the one that says (12:30 - 12:35)
like uh preventing a player from (12:33 - 12:38)
entering any input I think the thing (12:35 - 12:39)
that most players had frustration with (12:38 - 12:41)
was um sometimes when you go to like (12:39 - 12:43)
heel cheer or defense cheer you would (12:41 - 12:45)
get stuck in that menu that that issue (12:43 - 12:47)
is still there yeah guys you still get (12:45 - 12:49)
stuck it's not been fixed (12:47 - 12:50)
um (12:49 - 12:53)
and uh I mean we can speculate maybe (12:50 - 12:55)
that's why randoms uh in your raids (12:53 - 12:56)
don't heal cheer because they're (12:55 - 12:59)
terrified of getting stuck I don't like (12:56 - 13:00)
them (12:59 - 13:02)
but yeah and when you're trying to play (13:00 - 13:04)
like a Healer like a klefki or a grim (13:02 - 13:06)
snarl or or something and you're like (13:04 - 13:08)
okay I gotta go heel cheer you know I do (13:06 - 13:09)
notice that it happens at certain times (13:08 - 13:11)
like it definitely happens when the boss (13:09 - 13:14)
is like about to clear where it's like (13:11 - 13:17)
I'm more likely to get stuck versus the (13:14 - 13:19)
boss is just you know using high jump (13:17 - 13:20)
kick (13:19 - 13:22)
um because all Pokemon no high jump kick (13:20 - 13:25)
uh but (13:22 - 13:28)
it is a very frustrating issue still to (13:25 - 13:31)
get stuck in the cheer menu you're just (13:28 - 13:33)
in there and you can't do anything but (13:31 - 13:34)
watch everybody else keep doing the raid (13:33 - 13:36)
yeah you kind of Hope like you die (13:34 - 13:37)
because that'll at least get you out of (13:36 - 13:41)
the menu please let me die and then I (13:37 - 13:43)
can do something (13:41 - 13:43)
um battles tight matchups against (13:44 - 13:49)
Pokemon that have fainted will no longer (13:47 - 13:51)
appear while selecting move or Target (13:49 - 13:52)
during double battles I've seen this bug (13:51 - 13:54)
before this is like uh if you're doing (13:52 - 13:57)
rank ladder or just this is specifically (13:54 - 13:59)
for like online battles uh but I've (13:57 - 14:02)
noticed if it if if you're doing a 4v4 (13:59 - 14:05)
and this would only really work for 4v4 (14:02 - 14:06)
actually it wouldn't work for singles (14:05 - 14:07)
because there's not two Pokemon on the (14:06 - 14:09)
field uh let's say you were doing a 4v4 (14:07 - 14:12)
and you have uh you're against like a (14:09 - 14:13)
high dragon and a grim snarl and then (14:12 - 14:15)
the high Dragon dies and so it's to your (14:13 - 14:18)
two Pokemon against just a grim snarl (14:15 - 14:20)
um and one of your Pokemon is Garchomp (14:18 - 14:21)
it will say it would it would have said (14:20 - 14:23)
that the (14:21 - 14:25)
um Dragon Claw is super effective (14:23 - 14:27)
against the Grim snarl I saw that I've (14:25 - 14:29)
seen this tons of times because I (14:27 - 14:30)
watched competitive (14:29 - 14:32)
um but it's not super effective against (14:30 - 14:33)
the Grim snarl it's saying that it was (14:32 - 14:35)
super effective because there used to be (14:33 - 14:36)
a high dragon on the field and it would (14:35 - 14:39)
have been super effective against that (14:36 - 14:41)
so if I'm pretty sure I ran into that (14:39 - 14:42)
during maybe a gym battle or something (14:41 - 14:44)
as well I know I ran into that during (14:42 - 14:45)
normal gameplay (14:44 - 14:47)
so that would have been the (14:45 - 14:49)
ghost girl (14:47 - 14:51)
Ryan it might have been it might have (14:49 - 14:53)
also just been let's see (14:51 - 14:57)
uh one Pokemon fainted and then the (14:53 - 14:59)
other was sent out and it was right in (14:57 - 15:02)
that moment oh okay okay (14:59 - 15:05)
um so I think for if you're a (15:02 - 15:06)
competitive player if your whole thing (15:05 - 15:07)
is competitive I don't think you use (15:06 - 15:08)
that feature anyways because you're (15:07 - 15:10)
you're probably already thinking like I (15:08 - 15:12)
know what move I need to hit against (15:10 - 15:13)
Grim Starling it's definitely not Dragon (15:12 - 15:15)
claw but I definitely saw people (15:13 - 15:17)
go like oh well it says this is super (15:15 - 15:19)
effective and I'm like that's not true (15:17 - 15:21)
that's not gonna do any damage because (15:19 - 15:23)
that's a fairy Pokemon uh and then they (15:21 - 15:25)
learn the hard way that that did indeed (15:23 - 15:28)
do no damage so that has been fixed we (15:25 - 15:30)
have fixed a bug where in which zorark (15:28 - 15:32)
that have tressalized and was disguised (15:30 - 15:35)
as another Pokemon via its illusion uh (15:32 - 15:38)
ability could have been identified by (15:35 - 15:40)
zorark using the check Target option I (15:38 - 15:43)
don't know what that is but okay (15:40 - 15:46)
when you focus it's one you're aiming I (15:43 - 15:48)
think (15:46 - 15:48)
that has triathlies wouldn't it be one (15:52 - 15:56)
of the roaming no this is specifically (15:54 - 15:57)
saying a bug when zorark has (15:56 - 15:59)
rationalized (15:57 - 16:02)
I wonder if in battle if zorark (15:59 - 16:04)
tracelized it revealed that it was (16:02 - 16:06)
zorark even though it hasn't been (16:04 - 16:08)
revealed that it's work (16:06 - 16:11)
I think that's what they're saying (16:08 - 16:12)
check Target would be when you hit the Y (16:11 - 16:15)
button to check if there's like reflect (16:12 - 16:17)
up or to check (16:15 - 16:19)
if like something is negative one (16:17 - 16:22)
so I think in that menu (16:19 - 16:23)
look there's not a lot of competitive (16:22 - 16:25)
zeroarks going around (16:23 - 16:28)
probably a very specific book (16:25 - 16:30)
um we have fixed a bug where the type (16:28 - 16:33)
matchup for uh targeting Czar (16:30 - 16:35)
catrassilized disguises another Pokemon (16:33 - 16:37)
so this is kind of piggybacking off the (16:35 - 16:39)
first one we have fixed in bug where the (16:37 - 16:42)
stats of Don dozo with atasuguri in its (16:39 - 16:45)
mouth increased Don dozo's used order up (16:42 - 16:47)
uh when the move should have been (16:45 - 16:49)
negated for example if a Pokemon used (16:47 - 16:52)
protect we have fixed a bug where the (16:49 - 16:53)
effects of Destiny Bond failed to (16:52 - 16:55)
activate if a trash lies Pokemon the (16:53 - 16:58)
turn after it used Destiny Bond and then (16:55 - 16:59)
failed (16:58 - 17:00)
um (16:59 - 17:02)
that seems like a very specific bug but (17:00 - 17:04)
okay (17:02 - 17:06)
um I don't think it says here but I (17:04 - 17:07)
swear I read it we're reading this off (17:06 - 17:09)
nintendolife.com (17:07 - 17:10)
um but I think they said they fixed a (17:09 - 17:12)
bug where a pokemon would randomly (17:11 - 17:14)
reappear on the battlefield in a double (17:12 - 17:15)
battle you couldn't attack it or (17:14 - 17:17)
anything it would just like show (17:15 - 17:20)
I am back I'm the ghost of the thing you (17:17 - 17:23)
killed I'm here now yeah (17:20 - 17:23)
um some other things we addressed an (17:24 - 17:27)
issue that made the game prone to (17:26 - 17:30)
forcibly close at certain locations as a (17:27 - 17:32)
result of this fix there might be fewer (17:30 - 17:34)
Pokemon and people displayed in certain (17:32 - 17:36)
towns or the wild (17:34 - 17:38)
um I think this is like a pretty big one (17:36 - 17:41)
there there are still people that tell (17:38 - 17:42)
me they've never had their game Crash (17:41 - 17:44)
which (17:42 - 17:46)
bless your heart I think you guys are (17:44 - 17:48)
all lying I think this is a big (17:46 - 17:50)
conspiracy you guys are all working (17:48 - 17:52)
it's 200 hours we know you don't play (17:50 - 17:54)
the actual game Hannah you are just (17:52 - 17:56)
turning it on and letting it sit on the (17:54 - 17:59)
screen for 200 hours so I think it would (17:56 - 18:01)
have crashed then (17:59 - 18:04)
I've tried that I've tried standing (18:01 - 18:05)
standing the second I pick up my (18:04 - 18:07)
controller in the cave crash I'm done (18:05 - 18:10)
how dare you (18:07 - 18:14)
um yeah I mean I'm probably up to like (18:10 - 18:18)
maybe like 15 16 crashes in the 350 (18:14 - 18:20)
hours I I've had (18:18 - 18:23)
um to be fair since the update I have (18:20 - 18:26)
had it crashed zero times (18:23 - 18:27)
um (18:26 - 18:29)
I mean I've heard neither have I but I (18:27 - 18:32)
only played twice (18:29 - 18:32)
um I wish I wish this bullet point was (18:34 - 18:39)
more specific because it says as a (18:37 - 18:41)
result of the fix there may be fewer (18:39 - 18:43)
Pokemon or people in certain areas or (18:41 - 18:46)
towns and of course I saw social media (18:43 - 18:48)
run crazy with this I saw people just (18:46 - 18:50)
make up statistics like they're removing (18:48 - 18:52)
25 of all the Pokemon (18:50 - 18:56)
that that's just not true right like (18:52 - 18:59)
I I I I went through I went through yeah (18:56 - 19:01)
it's actually 50 uh thank you very much (18:59 - 19:03)
I went through the I did the whole map (19:01 - 19:05)
right since the update one point two did (19:03 - 19:07)
the whole map you went to leg Lake did (19:05 - 19:11)
you like I went to leg Forest I went to (19:07 - 19:13)
leg Mountain like I've been I've been (19:11 - 19:15)
everywhere and I thought to myself there (19:13 - 19:17)
are probably less Pokemon here (19:15 - 19:20)
but I can't remember or like it's so (19:17 - 19:22)
hard to tell because I'm still seeing (19:20 - 19:25)
Pokemon like like I'm not in like not (19:22 - 19:27)
noticeable yeah it's not like I'm in leg (19:25 - 19:28)
Lake and I'm like wow there are no (19:27 - 19:31)
Pokemon around me dang you game freak (19:28 - 19:32)
yeah the world still feels very (19:31 - 19:37)
populated yeah yeah and as for like NPCs (19:32 - 19:39)
I boy I like you would have had been (19:37 - 19:42)
like documenting them or writing them (19:39 - 19:43)
down because I I've been in towns and (19:42 - 19:45)
I'm like (19:43 - 19:48)
I don't they this all looks the same I (19:45 - 19:50)
never do I name in every town so if they (19:48 - 19:52)
got rid of Frederico I am going to be (19:50 - 19:55)
furious (19:52 - 19:55)
we have fixed the bug in which part of (19:55 - 20:00)
uh we have fixed the bug in which a (19:57 - 20:02)
Pokemon that is not part of the paldeo (20:00 - 20:03)
Pokedex so that would be like Charizard (20:02 - 20:06)
was displayed as being registered to the (20:03 - 20:08)
pal day of Pokedex after being obtained (20:06 - 20:10)
through a link trade (20:08 - 20:13)
uh not 100 sure what that is but okay uh (20:10 - 20:14)
certain actions prevented main (20:13 - 20:16)
characters expressions from changing (20:14 - 20:19)
until the game was closed and reopened (20:16 - 20:21)
I ran into that multiple times it was (20:19 - 20:24)
very frustrating (20:21 - 20:25)
uh they fixed a bug with battle rank (20:24 - 20:27)
rewards (20:25 - 20:29)
um they have fixed a bug which a player (20:27 - 20:30)
may have not received the master rank (20:29 - 20:32)
ribbon if they have registered several (20:30 - 20:33)
battle teams but not have used the (20:32 - 20:35)
battle team in the first slot when (20:33 - 20:38)
winning ranked battles in master ball of (20:35 - 20:39)
tier (20:38 - 20:41)
um we have fixed a bug in which a (20:39 - 20:43)
Pokemon that you have caught man I have (20:41 - 20:44)
listened to your commands in ordinance (20:43 - 20:47)
of what was written in the profile app (20:44 - 20:48)
um (20:47 - 20:49)
so it would be like if a Pokemon was (20:48 - 20:52)
caught as at level uh XX or below they (20:49 - 20:54)
would listen to commands (20:52 - 20:57)
um if that Pokemon was link traded back (20:54 - 21:01)
to you from another trainer oh I see I (20:57 - 21:03)
just had a discussion in the slack the (21:01 - 21:05)
day before the patch notes were released (21:03 - 21:06)
about exactly that trying to figure out (21:05 - 21:08)
if it was a bug or not (21:06 - 21:11)
we have fixed a bug in which new (21:08 - 21:13)
information may not have been added to (21:11 - 21:14)
your Pokedex after you receive a Shiny (21:13 - 21:17)
Pokemon or a Pokemon caught by trainer (21:14 - 21:18)
who played a different language via (21:17 - 21:21)
surprise trade if you have already had (21:18 - 21:23)
that species registered to your Pokedex (21:21 - 21:25)
objects such as pokeballs could be (21:23 - 21:27)
displayed in certain areas was an (21:25 - 21:29)
unintentional this has been fixed bummer (21:27 - 21:31)
what about the slowbros that appear down (21:29 - 21:32)
to keep the celebration because that was (21:31 - 21:34)
amazing (21:32 - 21:37)
passerbys are no longer displayed During (21:34 - 21:39)
certain battles that take place in towns (21:37 - 21:41)
or during the main story and a number of (21:39 - 21:44)
other bugs have been fixed so a couple (21:41 - 21:45)
things not listed here I guess not a bug (21:44 - 21:48)
uh but if you played double bat if you (21:45 - 21:50)
played battles online battles you could (21:48 - 21:52)
only play in the schoolyard which let me (21:50 - 21:54)
tell you after playing three years of (21:52 - 21:56)
sword and shield and being in a huge (21:54 - 21:58)
Stadium having Grandma cheer behind you (21:56 - 22:00)
with like four kids is not really the (21:58 - 22:02)
competitive scene that I personally want (22:00 - 22:07)
but you know I'm happy she showed up (22:02 - 22:07)
it's hard for her to get out of the (22:07 - 22:11)
house these days so the fact that she (22:10 - 22:14)
comes to your pathetic battles really (22:11 - 22:16)
shows her love for you that's true but (22:14 - 22:17)
now you can battle in the Elite Four (22:16 - 22:21)
room you can see that room once again in (22:17 - 22:22)
that room (22:21 - 22:27)
four members going like why are we here (22:22 - 22:27)
so go get her diaper changed uh and then (22:27 - 22:32)
I think you can battle on that Beach (22:30 - 22:35)
area where you first fight nimona so (22:32 - 22:37)
there are more there are more stadiums (22:35 - 22:39)
and I think they they updated the camera (22:37 - 22:43)
in battles so it's a little more Dynamic (22:39 - 22:45)
um (22:43 - 22:48)
uh I wasn't sure if this was a bug it's (22:45 - 22:50)
not mentioned here I verified it before (22:48 - 22:54)
1.2 I verified it after 1.2 this this is (22:50 - 22:57)
infuriating to me and uh uh (22:54 - 22:59)
people on the internet are dumb and they (22:57 - 23:01)
didn't understand what I was saying and (22:59 - 23:04)
I'm very mad about it because it I think (23:01 - 23:08)
it does take away a lot of what I think (23:04 - 23:11)
is fun about Pokemon which (23:08 - 23:13)
I'm gonna say RNG is fun about Pokemon (23:11 - 23:14)
but like (23:13 - 23:17)
that it is to an extent that's why (23:14 - 23:20)
people shiny hunt but (23:17 - 23:22)
I think it was in Gen 5 they introduced (23:20 - 23:24)
or maybe Gen 6 they introduced critical (23:22 - 23:25)
catching (23:24 - 23:27)
and what that is is it was like an (23:25 - 23:29)
increased chance that you're a (23:27 - 23:31)
guaranteed catch or not a guaranteed (23:29 - 23:32)
catch I think it was technically behind (23:31 - 23:35)
the code it's like times eight so like a (23:32 - 23:37)
like a quick ball when you use it on (23:35 - 23:39)
turn one is like times five a repeat (23:37 - 23:40)
ball is always like times four as long (23:39 - 23:42)
as you have the Pokemon registered but (23:40 - 23:44)
it would take you so so if you had a (23:42 - 23:46)
quick ball and then critical Catch (23:44 - 23:48)
activated it would multiply those two (23:46 - 23:50)
together right and it would be almost a (23:48 - 23:54)
critical catch so I feel like (23:50 - 23:54)
I know specifically in sword and shield (23:54 - 23:58)
the more Pokemon you caught per your (23:56 - 24:00)
decks the more likely you were to get (23:58 - 24:02)
critical catches and I was hitting (24:00 - 24:03)
critical catches left and right in (24:02 - 24:04)
Pokemon sword shield it was great right (24:03 - 24:07)
it's a great feeling in my opinion to be (24:04 - 24:09)
like ah this Pokemon has a really bad (24:07 - 24:11)
catch rate or oh I've thrown like 20 (24:09 - 24:12)
pokeballs at this Pokemon and then all (24:11 - 24:14)
of a sudden critical catches you catch (24:12 - 24:16)
it feels great right curl code catches (24:14 - 24:18)
have been around for 10 plus years in (24:16 - 24:19)
Pokemon games (24:18 - 24:22)
um they exist in Pokemon go uh they act (24:19 - 24:24)
how they should in Pokemon go right like (24:22 - 24:26)
I think Pokemon go it's like a one in (24:24 - 24:28)
200 chance to catch or something like (24:26 - 24:30)
that I don't know Niantic will never (24:28 - 24:30)
tell you (24:30 - 24:31)
um (24:30 - 24:33)
in this game (24:31 - 24:36)
that doesn't exist anymore and if it did (24:33 - 24:39)
exist it's impossible to tell and I I (24:36 - 24:41)
made a video about this and this is why (24:39 - 24:43)
I say people are dumb because half of (24:41 - 24:45)
the comments were like well you're using (24:43 - 24:47)
a Pokeball (24:45 - 24:47)
s is the easy (24:52 - 24:55)
test so what happens in scarlet and (24:53 - 25:00)
violet is that if you're if you're (24:55 - 25:02)
looking at a Le chunk and you go to (25:00 - 25:04)
throw a Pokeball chunk and the first (25:02 - 25:06)
time you catch little chunk you'll get (25:04 - 25:08)
the one shake two chick three Shake (25:06 - 25:10)
click and then you catch Le chunk right (25:08 - 25:13)
every lechonk you catch after that LE (25:10 - 25:16)
chunk will always critical catch but (25:13 - 25:18)
it's not critical catching that's the (25:16 - 25:22)
thing it is it is just giving you the (25:18 - 25:24)
critical catch animation for a (25:22 - 25:26)
successful catch so why this is (25:24 - 25:28)
infuriating (25:26 - 25:30)
is once once you know about it you're (25:28 - 25:32)
never going to unsee it but what it (25:30 - 25:35)
means is every Pokeball you throw if it (25:32 - 25:38)
doesn't shake in the air which is the (25:35 - 25:40)
critical catch animation so the ball (25:38 - 25:42)
rear Source hits the Pokemon it does (25:40 - 25:44)
this weird shake and you're like okay (25:42 - 25:45)
it's a good critical catch and then it (25:44 - 25:48)
clicks in the air if it doesn't do that (25:45 - 25:50)
it's never going to catch (25:48 - 25:52)
so every time you throw a Pokeball at a (25:50 - 25:54)
Pokemon now if it doesn't click in the (25:52 - 25:58)
air it's a failed catch no matter what (25:54 - 26:01)
um and it's it's a bummer because the (25:58 - 26:03)
suspense there's so many suspenseful (26:01 - 26:05)
things in Pokemon right there's like (26:03 - 26:06)
when you're like battling Mewtwo and (26:05 - 26:08)
he's one HP and he's asleep and you're (26:06 - 26:10)
on like your 50th Pokeball and it's like (26:08 - 26:12)
one shake two shake and you're like oh (26:10 - 26:14)
my gosh it's the third shake and then (26:12 - 26:15)
all of a sudden it breaks out you're (26:14 - 26:18)
like nah right like it's like that but (26:15 - 26:20)
you don't get that anymore right because (26:18 - 26:23)
if it hits that LE chunk and then it (26:20 - 26:25)
drops to the ground and you're like one (26:23 - 26:27)
shake two Shake three Shaker it's it's (26:25 - 26:29)
it you already know that it didn't catch (26:27 - 26:32)
so again you can test this as as long as (26:29 - 26:34)
the Pokemon is registered in your (26:32 - 26:36)
Pokedex you will always critical catch (26:34 - 26:39)
it so ultimately there is no suspense (26:36 - 26:41)
because once you know that it's gonna (26:39 - 26:42)
critical catch you're like well the (26:41 - 26:43)
three shakes is useless because I know (26:42 - 26:45)
it's not going to catch (26:43 - 26:47)
secondly it seems that critical catches (26:45 - 26:49)
are completely gone because if there is (26:47 - 26:50)
an increased catch rate of critical (26:49 - 26:51)
catch you would never see it because (26:50 - 26:52)
it's just pretending everything is (26:51 - 26:55)
critical catch thirdly if I guess you (26:52 - 26:57)
would be able to test it before you (26:55 - 26:59)
caught a Pokemon of like oh I don't have (26:57 - 27:02)
a stone gender registered in my decks (26:59 - 27:04)
and I just critical caught it that's (27:02 - 27:06)
great but that doesn't fix the after (27:04 - 27:08)
thought of like (27:06 - 27:09)
every stone Turner after this would (27:08 - 27:11)
always be a critical catch and thirdly (27:09 - 27:12)
to all the people being like well the (27:11 - 27:14)
the legendary Pokemon didn't do that (27:12 - 27:16)
yeah because they're not registered in (27:14 - 27:19)
your deck so you don't catch one of them (27:16 - 27:20)
which means there's still the good (27:19 - 27:21)
suspense that you're looking for for the (27:20 - 27:23)
legendary Pokemon (27:21 - 27:26)
that there is still suspense it's just (27:23 - 27:28)
shortened it's just a shorter length of (27:26 - 27:30)
time it's like when you're doing a raid (27:28 - 27:32)
in Pokemon go and you're down to your (27:30 - 27:34)
very last ball and if it shakes (27:32 - 27:37)
once and doesn't break out you know that (27:34 - 27:39)
you caught it that's a shortened length (27:37 - 27:42)
of time but if it shakes once and flees (27:39 - 27:45)
that's all it's gonna do (27:42 - 27:47)
that's a hard analogy for people who (27:45 - 27:50)
don't understand that mechanic (27:47 - 27:50)
I just I I get the the (27:53 - 28:00)
I get the we're gonna just crit catch (27:57 - 28:01)
all of the successful catches to save (28:00 - 28:03)
time (28:01 - 28:05)
but I feel like you're you're instead (28:03 - 28:07)
also wasting a lot of time that I have (28:05 - 28:10)
to sit through a failed animation that I (28:07 - 28:14)
know is a hundred percent failed like (28:10 - 28:16)
again it removes the suspensefulness of (28:14 - 28:17)
the three shakes because as soon as it (28:16 - 28:20)
drops to the ground I know that it's not (28:17 - 28:22)
going to work and I'm just I have to sit (28:20 - 28:23)
through that (28:22 - 28:24)
um (28:23 - 28:27)
obviously if you use you know if you (28:24 - 28:28)
always use Quick balls and you always (28:27 - 28:30)
use repeat balls you have a higher catch (28:28 - 28:32)
rate so you probably see that fail (28:30 - 28:34)
animation less but if you're trying to (28:32 - 28:36)
catch things in luxury balls which don't (28:34 - 28:38)
have increased catch rate or Premiere (28:36 - 28:40)
balls don't have increased catch rate (28:38 - 28:41)
um you have to sit through that (28:40 - 28:43)
animation a lot (28:41 - 28:48)
uh and again I I do think that the magic (28:43 - 28:51)
of critical catches just gone at this (28:48 - 28:53)
point like I can now now that I've (28:51 - 28:54)
realized that this is a thing I could go (28:53 - 28:55)
back and (28:54 - 28:57)
look at all my shiny catches and be like (28:55 - 28:58)
every single one of those were a (28:57 - 29:00)
critical catch because I don't think I (28:58 - 29:02)
ever caught a shiny that I didn't (29:00 - 29:04)
already have registered in my Pokedex to (29:02 - 29:06)
begin with so again the reason I bring (29:04 - 29:09)
that up is not to now ruin the magic (29:06 - 29:11)
that critical catches kind of busted in (29:09 - 29:13)
this game but it wasn't mentioned in the (29:11 - 29:15)
show note in the show notes yeah it was (29:13 - 29:16)
not mentioned in the show notes at all (29:15 - 29:18)
and we need to talk about that (29:16 - 29:20)
um it wasn't mentioned in the patch (29:18 - 29:21)
update so again I don't know if that's (29:20 - 29:23)
intentional or not I do think there is (29:21 - 29:26)
value in speeding up the catch rate and (29:23 - 29:27)
I think Legends did this really well (29:26 - 29:30)
where Legends would um it was hard to (29:27 - 29:31)
see in Legends because mostly that color (29:30 - 29:33)
palette was bad and everything looked (29:31 - 29:35)
Brown and the pokeballs were wooden (29:33 - 29:38)
which are also a shade of brown but when (29:35 - 29:40)
you caught in Legends it would do the (29:38 - 29:42)
three shakes as it like fell to the (29:40 - 29:44)
ground (29:42 - 29:48)
um so it was saving time that way (29:44 - 29:48)
again I I think I think there is value (29:48 - 29:54)
in speeding up catching (29:51 - 29:56)
um I don't think this is (29:54 - 29:59)
the right way to do it or maybe it is (29:56 - 30:00)
still bugged I haven't figured it out (29:59 - 30:02)
it's probably still bugged let's be real (30:00 - 30:05)
it is probably still bugged (30:02 - 30:07)
uh but but like for sure different in (30:05 - 30:09)
this game because again in sword and (30:07 - 30:11)
shield it was proven that the more (30:09 - 30:13)
Pokemon you caught the more likely you (30:11 - 30:15)
were to get critical catch so it was (30:13 - 30:17)
like even if you didn't care about The (30:15 - 30:19)
Shining charm (30:17 - 30:22)
uh filling out your Pokedex made your (30:19 - 30:26)
catching just better (30:22 - 30:26)
it just did (30:26 - 30:30)
um (30:28 - 30:30)
okay uh (30:30 - 30:35)
because we we deal in science here and (30:32 - 30:36)
because we are very scientific and (30:35 - 30:38)
because we only use the world's best (30:36 - 30:42)
information I did a Twitter poll oh good (30:38 - 30:46)
grief we got 2 526 votes that's a lot (30:42 - 30:48)
that's that's a lot of people could be (30:46 - 30:50)
more people could be less people could (30:48 - 30:53)
be I think it could be a lot of things (30:50 - 30:56)
uh the question was simple do we think (30:53 - 30:58)
the recent update to Pokemon scarlet and (30:56 - 31:00)
violet fixed some of the performance (30:58 - 31:05)
issues 46 says yes it feels better 54 (31:00 - 31:08)
says no it feels the same (31:05 - 31:10)
um (31:08 - 31:10)
I don't know what to believe anymore (31:10 - 31:15)
because I when I said when I booted up (31:12 - 31:17)
the game I went to the first thing I did (31:15 - 31:18)
after the update is I went to the lake (31:17 - 31:20)
and I drove around the lake and I was (31:18 - 31:22)
like this feels better and then I went (31:20 - 31:24)
to the forest and I was like this feels (31:22 - 31:26)
better and then when I was just going (31:24 - 31:29)
between places I was like I can't tell (31:26 - 31:31)
it if this is a placebo or not I can't (31:29 - 31:34)
tell if it actually is better or not you (31:31 - 31:36)
need to have one game side by side with (31:34 - 31:39)
the other one it's not updated yes (31:36 - 31:43)
can you can you launch a non-updated one (31:39 - 31:45)
can you force it to lunch yeah yeah you (31:43 - 31:48)
just can't connect to the internet (31:45 - 31:48)
um (31:48 - 31:53)
do you guys think it feels better no (31:49 - 31:53)
I think it does but I know I want it to (31:55 - 31:59)
and so I I don't really trust myself (31:57 - 32:02)
yeah I mean so there's a lot of placebo (31:59 - 32:03)
effect like you've been told that it (32:02 - 32:06)
feels better and until you run into the (32:03 - 32:09)
major glitches it's very hard for us to (32:06 - 32:13)
judge our own memories of is it faster (32:09 - 32:16)
or is it slower and I think you like it (32:13 - 32:18)
people who really really really really (32:16 - 32:19)
really really want the game to be better (32:18 - 32:21)
are going to say oh yeah this is better (32:19 - 32:24)
and people like me are like it feels the (32:21 - 32:27)
same but I'm also no I've I'm no longer (32:24 - 32:30)
invested in this game like they have (32:27 - 32:33)
sort of lost me on this game and none of (32:30 - 32:34)
the bug fixes that they actually feel (32:33 - 32:35)
like they've put in have really (32:34 - 32:37)
addressed any of the issues that I was (32:35 - 32:39)
having with it (32:37 - 32:41)
um and nonetheless stuff yeah just (32:39 - 32:43)
there's like (32:41 - 32:46)
I don't know it doesn't feel (32:43 - 32:49)
fun fixed like like the raids aren't (32:46 - 32:52)
great like the after the Patch when I (32:49 - 32:53)
did those Terror rates I was still (32:52 - 32:55)
running into menu Hang-Ups like the (32:53 - 32:56)
things that I still actually do post (32:55 - 32:59)
game we're not feeling any better and (32:56 - 33:00)
I'm like this is (32:59 - 33:03)
a nothing burger right now like you (33:00 - 33:05)
didn't really address any of the (33:03 - 33:06)
performance issues that people are (33:05 - 33:08)
having you alluded to them but you (33:06 - 33:10)
didn't really (33:08 - 33:13)
address them (33:10 - 33:15)
um you fixed bugs that are in your notes (33:13 - 33:18)
are very very specific but nothing like (33:15 - 33:20)
hey we know you would fall through the (33:18 - 33:23)
Earth sometimes that's been fixed like (33:20 - 33:26)
and so it's really hard to be like oh (33:23 - 33:28)
it's so much better when the things that (33:26 - 33:30)
I actually do which are Terror rate (33:28 - 33:31)
battles (33:30 - 33:33)
feel exactly the same I still get hung (33:31 - 33:35)
up on things (33:33 - 33:37)
um I haven't seen a Zuma reel come in in (33:35 - 33:38)
a long time so I don't I haven't run (33:37 - 33:42)
into the play rough bug in a while so (33:38 - 33:44)
I don't know it (33:42 - 33:47)
I'm not into it so I it does not feel (33:44 - 33:50)
any different to me (33:47 - 33:50)
Hannah (33:51 - 33:55)
um I mean I already said I want it to be (33:53 - 33:57)
better so I don't necessarily trust how (33:55 - 34:00)
I feel about it but I do think that (33:57 - 34:01)
going and running around the light going (34:00 - 34:03)
and running around the places that did (34:01 - 34:06)
lag substantially before the patch I do (34:03 - 34:08)
think it feels better it's easier to (34:06 - 34:10)
just go and uh mindlessly collect items (34:08 - 34:12)
when running around the lake which is (34:10 - 34:14)
something I've done a few times (34:12 - 34:16)
um I did (34:14 - 34:17)
so I had been holding off on getting the (34:16 - 34:19)
physical copies of these games until (34:17 - 34:23)
after the Patch because for uh (34:19 - 34:25)
reasons I had to get the digital copy (34:23 - 34:26)
when it came out and I don't usually (34:25 - 34:28)
like having the digital copy so patch (34:26 - 34:30)
came out I ordered the physical copies (34:28 - 34:33)
and I have them coming tomorrow and I (34:30 - 34:36)
may just try to do that side by side of (34:33 - 34:40)
chat check to see whether without the (34:36 - 34:43)
update and with the update is there a (34:40 - 34:45)
substantial difference there at least (34:43 - 34:47)
one running around I agree with Greg (34:45 - 34:49)
that I don't feel like the raids are (34:47 - 34:51)
much better which is unfortunate because (34:49 - 34:53)
that really is the main thing that (34:51 - 34:54)
they're trying to use to get you to come (34:53 - 34:55)
back yeah (34:54 - 34:57)
I like running around the map I like (34:56 - 35:00)
doing random things outside of the raids (34:57 - 35:02)
so I'm still happy with the game I still (35:00 - 35:03)
want to live in this world I'm still (35:02 - 35:06)
really loving these games but the raids (35:03 - 35:07)
themselves (35:06 - 35:10)
still are not great (35:07 - 35:12)
yeah I think (35:10 - 35:15)
the first like 15 minutes I had with the (35:12 - 35:17)
update I was like man the boxes are (35:15 - 35:20)
fixed the uh the Everything feels better (35:17 - 35:23)
and then the more and the more I played (35:20 - 35:24)
it because I played a lot this past week (35:23 - 35:27)
I was just like (35:24 - 35:29)
more and more disappointed (35:27 - 35:31)
like again the first 15 minutes I was (35:29 - 35:34)
like man I'm so happy with this and then (35:31 - 35:36)
I it kind of like started to unravel of (35:34 - 35:39)
like oh wait this isn't fixed this isn't (35:36 - 35:41)
fixed I get stuck in the cheer menu like (35:39 - 35:42)
that was such a big like in raids like (35:41 - 35:44)
getting stuck in the cheer menu feels (35:42 - 35:46)
awful huge disappointment and like (35:44 - 35:48)
there's 400 Pokemon in the game right if (35:46 - 35:50)
they were like I would rather them fix (35:48 - 35:52)
the cheer menu thing than the play rough (35:50 - 35:54)
thing like there are there are there are (35:52 - 35:56)
700 moves in this game I can pick a (35:54 - 35:59)
different Fairy Type move right like I (35:56 - 36:02)
need to cheer in every raid and that's (35:59 - 36:04)
the thing that's not fixed (36:02 - 36:04)
um (36:04 - 36:08)
the Box Thing felt much better so that (36:04 - 36:11)
that was good but again there was just (36:08 - 36:13)
other things where I'm like (36:11 - 36:15)
why hasn't this been fixed why didn't (36:13 - 36:18)
you put Mass release back in (36:15 - 36:21)
like right there's there are so many (36:18 - 36:22)
little things that have existed before (36:21 - 36:26)
that you just don't you still don't do (36:22 - 36:29)
and it is sort of frustrating to be like (36:26 - 36:31)
yeah these are bugs that you need to fix (36:29 - 36:33)
there are still bugs that exist that you (36:31 - 36:34)
haven't fixed you haven't acknowledged (36:33 - 36:38)
there's still performance issues like (36:34 - 36:40)
you may have made it slightly better but (36:38 - 36:41)
I think (36:40 - 36:44)
you needed to make it significantly (36:41 - 36:47)
better for people to really be like this (36:44 - 36:49)
is amazing they finally gave me the game (36:47 - 36:50)
that I wanted and they just haven't (36:49 - 36:52)
delivered that yet (36:50 - 36:54)
I I know like (36:52 - 36:56)
the speculation is like (36:54 - 36:59)
game freak is rushed and needs more time (36:56 - 37:02)
for these games and whatever (36:59 - 37:05)
I think if anything this game shows it (37:02 - 37:06)
the most (37:05 - 37:11)
like the fact that you couldn't even do (37:06 - 37:14)
the basic box movements that you could (37:11 - 37:17)
do in every Pokemon game before this and (37:14 - 37:20)
like oh you added like you're like it (37:17 - 37:22)
was great to be like oh marks are coming (37:20 - 37:23)
back because you never know right (37:22 - 37:24)
anytime game freak adds a feature it's (37:23 - 37:27)
like our seasons in black and white (37:24 - 37:29)
coming back no no that's only for that (37:27 - 37:30)
game nope so it's like oh our marks only (37:29 - 37:32)
for sword and shield like are alphas (37:30 - 37:35)
only for Legends Arceus like we don't (37:32 - 37:37)
know until the next game (37:35 - 37:40)
and uh (37:37 - 37:42)
uh the fact that they were they like (37:40 - 37:44)
added in those features and were like (37:42 - 37:45)
you can now do this it's like we could (37:44 - 37:47)
have always done that (37:45 - 37:50)
right I took you three months to like (37:47 - 37:52)
add it and fix it it's it's it's a bit (37:50 - 37:54)
frustrating and I know like the reason (37:52 - 37:55)
like they can't delay is because the (37:54 - 37:57)
anime and the card game and all that (37:55 - 37:58)
stuff and (37:57 - 38:01)
um who knows it's really hard to say (37:58 - 38:04)
that it's rushed right like it's hard to (38:01 - 38:05)
say because we don't know what were (38:04 - 38:07)
decisions that they felt they didn't (38:05 - 38:09)
need to include and then once the game (38:07 - 38:11)
was out people were like why did you get (38:09 - 38:12)
rid of this and they're like oh we (38:11 - 38:14)
didn't think anybody cared like it's (38:12 - 38:16)
hard to determine what was (38:14 - 38:18)
missed because they didn't think about (38:16 - 38:20)
it what was a deliberate decision and (38:18 - 38:21)
what was because they had a Time (38:20 - 38:24)
crunching couldn't complete it and it's (38:21 - 38:26)
really hard to say like well this is (38:24 - 38:28)
part of their box functionality (38:26 - 38:30)
so given the fact that you all believe (38:28 - 38:32)
they copy and paste that it would have (38:30 - 38:34)
been a decision to not copy and paste (38:32 - 38:36)
that code right like right they could (38:34 - 38:38)
always do it so they deliberately chose (38:36 - 38:41)
not to include it for a reason it's (38:38 - 38:44)
really hard to Divine out exactly where (38:41 - 38:47)
in the process it either was missed was (38:44 - 38:49)
a bug or they didn't feel they needed to (38:47 - 38:52)
include it for some reason so I I always (38:49 - 38:54)
push against the idea that (38:52 - 38:57)
it was rushed because every game every (38:54 - 38:59)
project everything is rushed at the end (38:57 - 39:01)
there is no 100 there is no project (38:59 - 39:04)
that's like we were done seven months (39:01 - 39:05)
before we've been coasting on nothing (39:04 - 39:08)
forever everybody is working on (39:05 - 39:09)
everything up until the minute that they (39:08 - 39:10)
can't (39:09 - 39:12)
so (39:10 - 39:15)
I I don't like talking about they it was (39:12 - 39:18)
rushed because we don't know what they (39:15 - 39:20)
prioritized we don't know what their (39:18 - 39:23)
decisions were and every project (39:20 - 39:24)
every project is chaos and tell you (39:23 - 39:27)
they're like just get it out the door (39:24 - 39:28)
um I do think I've talked about the (39:27 - 39:31)
Salesforce I do think what we are seeing (39:28 - 39:35)
across the board on all AAA games is the (39:31 - 39:38)
industry turning against QA and seeing (39:35 - 39:41)
quality assurance as (39:38 - 39:43)
skippable as part of their business (39:41 - 39:45)
because they'll just let the player base (39:43 - 39:48)
do it for free and they'll weather the (39:45 - 39:50)
bad PR for a while and I think that is a (39:48 - 39:53)
bigger issue that we are seeing across (39:50 - 39:55)
multiple platforms across multiple (39:53 - 39:58)
instances where they are doing the bare (39:55 - 40:00)
minimum of quality assurance because (39:58 - 40:02)
that's expensive and they don't want to (40:00 - 40:04)
pay those people and just saying you (40:02 - 40:07)
know there's no such thing yeah and also (40:04 - 40:10)
there's no such thing as bad PR (40:07 - 40:12)
and I I think that's really hurting the (40:10 - 40:13)
industry (40:12 - 40:15)
everywhere right now (40:13 - 40:18)
yeah I mean you make a really good point (40:15 - 40:20)
Greg is like if if the if the whole (40:18 - 40:22)
problem with sword and shield or what (40:20 - 40:24)
people were mad about sword and shield (40:22 - 40:26)
was the copy and paste (40:24 - 40:28)
like boxes should have been copy and (40:26 - 40:30)
pasted like what they added in this (40:28 - 40:32)
update was everything we could have done (40:30 - 40:33)
in sword and shield yeah (40:32 - 40:35)
for boxes for boxes and it was already (40:33 - 40:37)
there it's roughly the same engine it (40:35 - 40:40)
doesn't make sense to say oh they they (40:37 - 40:41)
it was rushed (40:40 - 40:44)
the functionality was there it's there (40:41 - 40:47)
across multiple games (40:44 - 40:48)
so like (40:47 - 40:50)
could they just not get it fixed in time (40:48 - 40:51)
and then removed it or did they not (40:50 - 40:53)
think it was important enough or now (40:51 - 40:54)
that I don't know it's it's it was just (40:53 - 40:56)
it's very frustrating to be like the (40:54 - 41:00)
boxes here suck yeah (40:56 - 41:02)
and now they added (41:00 - 41:03)
the thing that we wanted that should (41:02 - 41:05)
have been their day one (41:03 - 41:08)
but they're still not perfect right like (41:05 - 41:09)
there's still things in the boxes that (41:08 - 41:11)
could be significantly better I think (41:09 - 41:12)
there's a bigger conversation to be had (41:11 - 41:15)
of like (41:12 - 41:15)
I don't think 32 boxes of 30 is the (41:16 - 41:21)
correct way to organize Pokemon going (41:19 - 41:24)
forward I think that system in itself is (41:21 - 41:25)
outdated (41:24 - 41:29)
um and I I I wonder (41:25 - 41:32)
if people are feeling that now that (41:29 - 41:34)
features were removed and then they came (41:32 - 41:37)
back and then they're just like this is (41:34 - 41:39)
still not great like I don't know if (41:37 - 41:40)
anyone's like rushing back to the game (41:39 - 41:42)
because the boxes are fixed right yeah (41:40 - 41:44)
yeah I know (41:42 - 41:45)
um (41:44 - 41:47)
I think things like the boxes are (41:45 - 41:52)
hardcore fan issues yeah and they have (41:47 - 41:55)
the feeling true or not they feel that (41:52 - 41:58)
they can up most companies hear this (41:55 - 42:01)
that they can abuse hardcore fans (41:58 - 42:05)
more because they're more invested so (42:01 - 42:09)
they can do more frustrating things to (42:05 - 42:11)
those people without paying a price (42:09 - 42:14)
um which is sort of (42:11 - 42:16)
a generally bad thing the way that (42:14 - 42:18)
companies are behaving right now that (42:16 - 42:20)
like we know you have your money so we (42:18 - 42:21)
can (42:20 - 42:24)
we can deliver whatever to you and and (42:21 - 42:26)
give you back things slowly and you will (42:24 - 42:28)
be happy about it like a lot of (42:26 - 42:30)
companies think have a very cynical view (42:28 - 42:32)
about people who are very loyal to their (42:30 - 42:34)
product right now I think that that is (42:32 - 42:37)
just a general thing in the field (42:34 - 42:40)
yeah I would though that they're are (42:37 - 42:44)
also people at game freak who love to (42:40 - 42:46)
play their own games (42:44 - 42:49)
um and they're like a Bob I need you to (42:46 - 42:51)
add that functionality back to the boxes (42:49 - 42:54)
this is uh I mean I'm sure there are but (42:51 - 42:56)
we already started to know that Nintendo (42:54 - 42:57)
has a very (42:56 - 42:59)
when we've heard stories that they have (42:57 - 43:01)
a very negative feedback (42:59 - 43:04)
atmosphere right like you have to be (43:01 - 43:06)
very careful about the things that you (43:04 - 43:08)
call out particularly in Nintendo in (43:06 - 43:10)
these games to be not seen as a problem (43:08 - 43:12)
and I think that is a culture problem (43:10 - 43:14)
that we learned with kit and Krista that (43:12 - 43:15)
we didn't talk about the right things (43:14 - 43:18)
with them that that the feedback loop in (43:15 - 43:20)
these companies in particular although (43:18 - 43:21)
they seem to be good places to work for (43:20 - 43:24)
giving feedback or calling out problems (43:21 - 43:29)
seems to be received very negatively (43:24 - 43:29)
and so they are again like I think (43:29 - 43:34)
there's a fear in company of saying this (43:31 - 43:35)
is a problem we need to add it back in (43:34 - 43:38)
being a squeaky wheel that again they're (43:35 - 43:40)
relying on the fan and the public groups (43:38 - 43:43)
to be the people who don't have to (43:40 - 43:44)
report to them and rely on their (43:43 - 43:46)
paycheck to be the loud squeaky wheel (43:44 - 43:48)
that they finally can say well we (43:46 - 43:50)
brought this up we tried to let you know (43:48 - 43:52)
but we didn't want to make a big thing (43:50 - 43:54)
about it you know I I do think there is (43:52 - 43:58)
a slightly bad feedback culture in game (43:54 - 44:01)
freak and in Nintendo specifically (43:58 - 44:03)
back to whether the games are a rushed (44:01 - 44:05)
or not I don't know (44:03 - 44:08)
is if if they took the three months (44:05 - 44:09)
game's been out for three months and (44:08 - 44:14)
this update was on November 1st (44:09 - 44:14)
I don't know if people would feel better (44:14 - 44:17)
about that (44:15 - 44:19)
like like the games are still kind of a (44:17 - 44:21)
mess today and I'm sure there are some (44:19 - 44:23)
people listening that are like I haven't (44:21 - 44:24)
had any of these issues or like (44:23 - 44:27)
everything runs fine for me but like (44:24 - 44:28)
it's it's it doesn't look any better (44:27 - 44:31)
right right it's still it's still frame (44:28 - 44:32)
ready to be fair I haven't fallen (44:31 - 44:34)
through the floor since (44:32 - 44:37)
I I think I think (44:34 - 44:39)
there is I think there is if they had (44:37 - 44:42)
come out with this patch in the middle (44:39 - 44:44)
of December people would have felt that (44:42 - 44:47)
they are being way more responsive than (44:44 - 44:49)
the beginning or the end of February (44:47 - 44:51)
beginning of March (44:49 - 44:53)
um yeah because I think a lot of people (44:51 - 44:56)
think this was very underwhelming like (44:53 - 44:58)
there are bigger fish to fry and this is (44:56 - 45:00)
what you've done this feels like (44:58 - 45:03)
like the Box fixes feels like you could (45:00 - 45:05)
have done that back in December and that (45:03 - 45:06)
would have been a bigger win than three (45:05 - 45:08)
months into the game when a lot of (45:06 - 45:10)
people are like well or like me like the (45:08 - 45:12)
game has kind of turned me off (45:10 - 45:14)
and your response time of fixing things (45:12 - 45:17)
has been slow and you still haven't (45:14 - 45:20)
really fixed the things that I do do (45:17 - 45:20)
well they did they did add a couple new (45:22 - 45:25)
things which I think were probably (45:24 - 45:28)
scheduled to line up with Pokemon day (45:25 - 45:30)
anyways I think like they like this was (45:28 - 45:32)
their like little surprise free update (45:30 - 45:33)
for Pokemon day um we'll get to that (45:32 - 45:36)
after the break uh but we will be right (45:33 - 45:41)
back and we are back from our break okay (45:36 - 45:42)
so uh we talked about this last week (45:41 - 45:45)
they or a couple days ago I guess uh (45:42 - 45:48)
they added walking wake and iron leaves (45:45 - 45:51)
as new Paradox Pokemon (45:48 - 45:54)
to scarlet and violet they exist they'll (45:51 - 45:57)
be here until March 12th I think (45:54 - 45:58)
um and then (45:57 - 46:01)
I would assume that will get us seven (45:58 - 46:03)
new seven star or a new something when (46:01 - 46:05)
those end I wouldn't be surprised if (46:03 - 46:07)
when this podcast goes up we'll know (46:05 - 46:09)
what that is (46:07 - 46:13)
but also who knows also who knows uh (46:09 - 46:16)
they're on their own timeline here (46:13 - 46:20)
Janine is also on vacation so yeah (46:16 - 46:22)
so I I think (46:20 - 46:24)
I think everyone is maybe in agreement (46:22 - 46:26)
that that was gonna come Pokemon day (46:24 - 46:29)
regardless of issues or not I think the (46:26 - 46:30)
other thing that was gonna come Pokemon (46:29 - 46:33)
day regardless of issues or not is the (46:30 - 46:37)
Vivion compatibility that they added (46:33 - 46:40)
um so now uh I think the one that was in (46:37 - 46:43)
the game currently was the fancy pattern (46:40 - 46:44)
if I remember (46:43 - 46:47)
is it fancy or is it modern (46:44 - 46:49)
it's not modern modern is like blue (46:47 - 46:50)
isn't it (46:49 - 46:53)
modern is red and blue I think oh modern (46:50 - 46:56)
is red and blue from Southeastern us I (46:53 - 46:59)
have yeah some Vivion up here (46:56 - 46:59)
um (46:59 - 47:01)
there's too many (46:59 - 47:03)
Vivion uh (47:01 - 47:06)
so they added compatibility to Pokemon (47:03 - 47:09)
go which I think is really great I think (47:06 - 47:11)
that's a overall a positive I think it's (47:09 - 47:13)
a fun way to interact between the two (47:11 - 47:16)
ideally what you do is um just like in (47:13 - 47:18)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee uh in (47:16 - 47:19)
Pokemon go there's a little switch (47:18 - 47:22)
button that appears in um Scarlet Violet (47:19 - 47:24)
if you go under mystery gift and you go (47:22 - 47:26)
to that they added connect to Pokemon go (47:24 - 47:29)
ideally you connect between the two and (47:26 - 47:30)
then in Pokemon go you pick one of your (47:29 - 47:33)
postcards and then you send it to your (47:30 - 47:35)
switch game you still keep the postcard (47:33 - 47:37)
in the mobile version so you don't lose (47:35 - 47:40)
it so if you had a postcard from I don't (47:37 - 47:43)
know will who is in Hawaii right now uh (47:40 - 47:46)
and then you send that postcard to yours (47:43 - 47:48)
yeah I don't think he sent me a postcard (47:46 - 47:51)
now that I'm thinking about this no uh (47:48 - 47:53)
I've gotten a couple oh my goodness so (47:51 - 47:56)
if if Will sent you a postcard from (47:53 - 47:58)
Hawaii you would then send that to your (47:56 - 48:00)
copy of scarlet Violet I sent some (47:58 - 48:03)
people postcards from Florida so (48:00 - 48:05)
oh boy (48:03 - 48:06)
thank you for taking the risk of going (48:05 - 48:09)
to Florida Greg I paid for the risk I (48:06 - 48:12)
took you going to Florida so let's (48:09 - 48:12)
um so Hawaii would give you the ocean (48:13 - 48:18)
Vivion and then you instead of the the (48:14 - 48:20)
instead of the current only single (48:18 - 48:22)
Vivion that would spawn in Scarlet (48:20 - 48:23)
Violet the ocean ones would start (48:22 - 48:25)
spawning for 24 hours so this is really (48:23 - 48:28)
great because not because it encourages (48:25 - 48:29)
you to play Pokemon go if you do play (48:28 - 48:31)
Pokemon go and you like the Vivion stuff (48:29 - 48:33)
which I think most players in Pokemon go (48:31 - 48:35)
really did like the Vivion stuff that (48:33 - 48:37)
they did it's like the one win Niantic (48:35 - 48:38)
had in the last 12 months (48:37 - 48:43)
um the uh you can then move those over (48:38 - 48:45)
and then you can shiny hunt them or just (48:43 - 48:46)
collect them I think this is the first (48:45 - 48:48)
time ever to not including Pokemon go (48:46 - 48:50)
that realistically you could get every (48:48 - 48:53)
Vivion with your own trainer ID (48:50 - 48:55)
um you could collect Vivion through (48:53 - 48:56)
Pokemon home you could collect them (48:55 - 48:59)
through X and Y but like X and Y had (48:56 - 49:01)
that weird like 3DS specific thing where (48:59 - 49:03)
it like pinpointed where your 3DS was (49:01 - 49:06)
originally powered on and so this is (49:03 - 49:07)
ultimately the first time to get pretty (49:06 - 49:09)
much all of them with your own trainer (49:07 - 49:11)
IDs (49:09 - 49:13)
except for the Pokeball pattern except (49:11 - 49:14)
for that which was only event anyway (49:13 - 49:15)
which is going to be the seventh star (49:14 - 49:16)
raid (49:15 - 49:19)
[Laughter] (49:16 - 49:20)
perfect (49:19 - 49:21)
um (49:20 - 49:24)
so uh they added that which was uh which (49:21 - 49:26)
was a very nice surprise (49:24 - 49:28)
um it's also cool that when you are uh (49:26 - 49:30)
Union circling with people who have (49:28 - 49:33)
invited different Vivion to their paldea (49:30 - 49:34)
regions then you can see all of the (49:33 - 49:36)
different Vivion (49:34 - 49:39)
at the same time yeah you can host (49:36 - 49:41)
little catch parties (49:39 - 49:43)
surprisingly there was no updates or bug (49:41 - 49:45)
fixes to co-op I'm still shocked to the (49:43 - 49:49)
day that the co-op works I mean (49:45 - 49:52)
I've had fun with it yeah (49:49 - 49:54)
so (49:52 - 49:56)
that that is not in the game uh and that (49:54 - 49:58)
works I've tried it (49:56 - 50:02)
and it it seems fine except uh there was (49:58 - 50:05)
a Reddit post that popped up (50:02 - 50:08)
um that said that they were doing the (50:05 - 50:10)
Vivion stuff and they went to boot up (50:08 - 50:13)
their game and uh it was gone every (50:10 - 50:16)
everything was gone it acted like a (50:13 - 50:17)
brand new game when they booted it up (50:16 - 50:20)
and of course Reddit comments don't know (50:17 - 50:22)
how to read other Reddit comments and (50:20 - 50:24)
there's 800 comments being like did you (50:22 - 50:27)
try the X up B recovery thing and they (50:24 - 50:30)
were like yes and I bless their soul (50:27 - 50:32)
their response responding to every (50:30 - 50:35)
single one of them but yeah I just go up (50:32 - 50:39)
and say uh edit I've tried the thing (50:35 - 50:43)
yeah they did so for those that don't (50:39 - 50:44)
know there's like an emergency emergency (50:43 - 50:47)
recovery in in Pokemon scarlet and (50:44 - 50:50)
violet if you are (50:47 - 50:51)
if you live in the wild west and you (50:50 - 50:53)
don't have auto save on for whatever (50:51 - 50:55)
weird reason Pokemon fans are against (50:53 - 50:56)
autosave even though like literally (50:55 - 50:59)
every single game in the entire world (50:56 - 51:02)
but if you like to live in the if you (50:59 - 51:04)
like to live on the edge of your seat in (51:02 - 51:06)
this very buggy mess that is Scarlet (51:04 - 51:07)
Violet and you're bold enough to turn (51:06 - 51:09)
off auto save and your game crashes (51:07 - 51:12)
um if on the title menu you press a (51:09 - 51:14)
combination of buttons I think it's xB (51:12 - 51:16)
and up if I remember correctly off the (51:14 - 51:18)
top of my head (51:16 - 51:20)
um it will open up a uh recovery menu (51:18 - 51:23)
and that recovery menu will show you a (51:20 - 51:25)
recent save that the game decided to say (51:23 - 51:27)
that that you could restore (51:25 - 51:28)
um (51:27 - 51:33)
and that doesn't work if you boot up (51:28 - 51:35)
your game and it thinks it's a brand new (51:33 - 51:37)
video game that that wouldn't work (51:35 - 51:38)
because there would be no recoveries (51:37 - 51:40)
safe I think that it's more that you (51:38 - 51:42)
boot it up and it boots up to a screen (51:40 - 51:44)
that says save data couldn't be (51:42 - 51:45)
recognized (51:44 - 51:49)
and then you can make a new game oh yeah (51:45 - 51:51)
you can make a new game on a different (51:49 - 51:55)
profile and what shows up when you try (51:51 - 51:56)
to boot up your game on your profile is (51:55 - 51:59)
that screen saying save data can't be (51:56 - 52:00)
recognized and so there are some people (51:59 - 52:03)
really really hoping that if this can be (52:00 - 52:04)
fixed (52:03 - 52:07)
uh that if they just don't delete their (52:04 - 52:09)
save data got it then maybe they'll be (52:07 - 52:13)
able to get back in someday yeah (52:09 - 52:14)
um (52:13 - 52:17)
and and just a side note the the way (52:14 - 52:18)
that the (52:17 - 52:21)
game decides whether or not to recover (52:18 - 52:24)
your data with the emergency menu is (52:21 - 52:25)
usually just by talking to like a Nurse (52:24 - 52:27)
Joy um that's usually when the game (52:25 - 52:29)
decides to save on its own in the (52:27 - 52:31)
background without telling you (52:29 - 52:33)
um so (52:31 - 52:36)
uh that's usually where it pulls the the (52:33 - 52:39)
recovery from is uh either like entering (52:36 - 52:40)
I think it's like entering a building (52:39 - 52:42)
not flying but entering a building and (52:40 - 52:44)
or talking to their store like the two (52:42 - 52:47)
almost guaranteed save points anyways (52:44 - 52:49)
um not applicable here (52:47 - 52:52)
so because the person said they did (52:49 - 52:54)
Vivion last a bunch of people were like (52:52 - 52:56)
don't do the Vivion (52:54 - 52:58)
because that's causing you to lose the (52:56 - 53:00)
data there were a couple people when I (52:58 - 53:01)
say a couple I really mean like I read (53:00 - 53:03)
the whole thread because I was I wanted (53:01 - 53:06)
to see if there was answers (53:03 - 53:08)
uh when I say a couple I mean like three (53:06 - 53:09)
or four people that were like they were (53:08 - 53:10)
also doing the Vivian then it happened (53:09 - 53:13)
and then if you dive deeper there were a (53:10 - 53:14)
bunch of people that said they never (53:13 - 53:17)
even touched the Vivion uh they don't (53:14 - 53:20)
even play Pokemon go uh and they had the (53:17 - 53:22)
same issue (53:20 - 53:23)
um and it happened right after they (53:22 - 53:26)
booted up after they had updated and (53:23 - 53:30)
then Joe Serebii Mr Joe serebi tested (53:26 - 53:32)
the Vivion on a (53:30 - 53:36)
other non-main account that he had and (53:32 - 53:38)
from his research it didn't seem to be (53:36 - 53:41)
the Vivion causing the problem because (53:38 - 53:44)
he thought maybe that if (53:41 - 53:46)
there were two different vivions because (53:44 - 53:48)
the game couldn't remember which one to (53:46 - 53:49)
load that that was inherently causing (53:48 - 53:53)
the the data corruption and he he got it (53:49 - 53:55)
to have two different vivions on the (53:53 - 53:59)
same screen but also a handful of people (53:55 - 54:00)
said they'd even touch the video and (53:59 - 54:02)
they're having the same issue so it's (54:00 - 54:04)
really hard to say that like oh the (54:02 - 54:05)
Vivian's causing the issue when we know (54:04 - 54:07)
a handful of people never even touched (54:05 - 54:08)
it and they're having the same exact (54:07 - 54:10)
issue so I think more likely (54:08 - 54:12)
it would just be something to do with (54:10 - 54:14)
1.2 (54:12 - 54:17)
and not specifically Vivion (54:14 - 54:19)
um (54:17 - 54:21)
I do think it's it is definitely an (54:19 - 54:23)
update issue that if you haven't updated (54:21 - 54:26)
this hasn't been an issue but the way (54:23 - 54:27)
I've been reading it and I've been (54:26 - 54:29)
keeping a close eye on that thread (54:27 - 54:31)
because I'm very scared of this kind of (54:29 - 54:32)
thing happening (54:31 - 54:35)
um is that it seems to be something that (54:32 - 54:38)
happens either right after you get the (54:35 - 54:40)
update or right after you connect and do (54:38 - 54:42)
the Vivion thing and then save and close (54:40 - 54:44)
your game and then you boot it up to (54:42 - 54:45)
find this screen and find that you can't (54:44 - 54:48)
access your save file anymore this does (54:45 - 54:50)
seem like it's still a very small number (54:48 - 54:54)
of people so far only 25 30 people but (54:50 - 54:57)
still more every day (54:54 - 55:00)
um but right now I am mostly just not (54:57 - 55:02)
doing the Beyond stuff not doing the (55:00 - 55:06)
Vivion stuff myself and (55:02 - 55:07)
I don't know if you want to do it I (55:06 - 55:09)
would say maybe make a side profile for (55:07 - 55:12)
it well I mean I I don't I don't think (55:09 - 55:14)
I'm going away right like they're not (55:12 - 55:16)
going to remove the functionality you (55:14 - 55:17)
can wait (55:16 - 55:19)
yeah but but again yeah but you want to (55:17 - 55:21)
get the Gimme ghoul stuff and go (55:19 - 55:24)
potentially if you are someone who wants (55:21 - 55:26)
to get the Gimme ghoul stuff I mean I I (55:24 - 55:28)
want the Gimme cool stuff but this is (55:26 - 55:30)
why I don't want to like fear Monger (55:28 - 55:32)
because there's literally nothing we (55:30 - 55:33)
can't even say it's the Vivian stuff (55:32 - 55:35)
because we know that there's there's a (55:33 - 55:37)
handful of people that never touched it (55:35 - 55:39)
that have the same issue right like so (55:37 - 55:41)
it's like (55:39 - 55:43)
I can't even be like well play the (55:41 - 55:45)
entire game just don't do Vivion because (55:43 - 55:48)
but I mean it's hard to say it's hard to (55:45 - 55:49)
say (55:48 - 55:52)
how honest people are how much they're (55:49 - 55:54)
remembering they may have done the video (55:52 - 55:55)
man thing and said oh it happened after (55:54 - 55:57)
that 24 hour thing had passed like (55:55 - 56:00)
again to draw conclusions from people (55:57 - 56:03)
antidote anecdotal evidence is not a (56:00 - 56:05)
great way to draw conclusions about what (56:03 - 56:07)
is actually happening (56:05 - 56:11)
um so I mean proceed with caution but (56:07 - 56:14)
but things that people should like yeah (56:11 - 56:17)
play the game right like seem to think (56:14 - 56:21)
that there is a the connection is (56:17 - 56:24)
a Common Thread for a lot of people (56:21 - 56:27)
so if you can wait a week to see if (56:24 - 56:30)
Nintendo actually responds and says oh (56:27 - 56:32)
we've got found the bug and we fixed it (56:30 - 56:33)
or we've been able to replicate the bug (56:32 - 56:35)
and we fix it like I don't think there's (56:33 - 56:38)
anything to any problem of saying don't (56:35 - 56:41)
do the Vivion thing for a week to see (56:38 - 56:43)
because we have a lot of people saying (56:41 - 56:46)
it's very specifically tied to that (56:43 - 56:48)
um not a lot of people less than 10. (56:46 - 56:50)
yeah but how many people are (56:48 - 56:53)
reporting the bug (56:50 - 56:53)
somewhere between 20 and 30 I think at (56:53 - 56:58)
this point I mean as as a third of the (56:55 - 56:59)
people (56:58 - 57:01)
yeah yeah but there's also equal amount (56:59 - 57:02)
of people saying they never touched (57:01 - 57:04)
Vivion (57:02 - 57:06)
they never they never interacted with it (57:04 - 57:07)
at all they don't even have Pokemon go (57:06 - 57:10)
accounts I think it's very possible that (57:07 - 57:12)
this could be happening at two different (57:10 - 57:14)
points that it could be happening either (57:12 - 57:16)
when you do the Vivion stuff or right (57:14 - 57:18)
after the update (57:16 - 57:20)
right so like I've done the update I've (57:18 - 57:21)
done the Vivion stuff twice I haven't (57:20 - 57:24)
had any issues I'm not saying like Okay (57:21 - 57:26)
like I'm just saying that like we cannot (57:24 - 57:28)
no one can give you like right don't do (57:26 - 57:30)
this and it's a very very small number (57:28 - 57:34)
of people so far right so like (57:30 - 57:34)
I I guess if you're worried just don't (57:34 - 57:38)
play the game but I don't want to tell (57:36 - 57:40)
people not to play the game right like (57:38 - 57:42)
we you don't know what's causing it yeah (57:40 - 57:44)
I mean you (57:42 - 57:45)
you concerned I always say this if you (57:44 - 57:47)
are concerned don't (57:45 - 57:51)
don't play the game for a week like (57:47 - 57:53)
you can survive a week (57:51 - 57:56)
and hopefully they updated that quickly (57:53 - 57:57)
hopefully they will acknowledge it (57:56 - 57:59)
within the week otherwise at that point (57:57 - 58:01)
like at that point if they can't track (57:59 - 58:03)
it down in a week to say this is what's (58:01 - 58:05)
causing that bug then it's not very (58:03 - 58:07)
widespread and you are just taking the (58:05 - 58:09)
risk that an unknown amount of factors (58:07 - 58:12)
that they can't track down is causing it (58:09 - 58:13)
right there's there's so many questions (58:12 - 58:15)
like like if I (58:13 - 58:18)
if I had the energy (58:15 - 58:20)
and also the The Willpower to post on (58:18 - 58:22)
Reddit the first thing I would be like (58:20 - 58:25)
is are using Android or iOS right like (58:22 - 58:29)
can we narrow that down like are are you (58:25 - 58:31)
are you saving your game data to the SD (58:29 - 58:33)
card or to the switch do you even have (58:31 - 58:35)
an SD card like there there are so many (58:33 - 58:37)
questions that could have been asked in (58:35 - 58:38)
that thread especially by the original (58:37 - 58:41)
poster like the original poster but it (58:38 - 58:42)
could have been like I did Vivian last (58:41 - 58:45)
uh this is the type of switch I had this (58:42 - 58:47)
is the type of phone I had this is the (58:45 - 58:49)
the like like they're just doing that in (58:47 - 58:51)
the comments I I want to give a little (58:49 - 58:52)
bit of credit to the original poster (58:51 - 58:54)
because they keep commenting they keep (58:52 - 58:56)
updating they keep Gathering these (58:54 - 58:58)
things and saying that yes both people (58:56 - 59:01)
who have SD card save files people who (58:58 - 59:03)
have physical game cartridges people (59:01 - 59:05)
who've used Android people who've used (59:03 - 59:08)
iOS all of these kinds of people are (59:05 - 59:09)
getting the issue so I want to give a (59:08 - 59:10)
little bit of credit to the original (59:09 - 59:13)
poster okay because I read that the day (59:10 - 59:14)
it came out and there was like there was (59:13 - 59:18)
like 400 refreshing it all the time okay (59:14 - 59:21)
but that goes back to like (59:18 - 59:23)
again I don't want to come off as (59:21 - 59:25)
fear-mongering like some people and be (59:23 - 59:26)
like well just don't play the game or (59:25 - 59:28)
the game is busted because like there's (59:26 - 59:29)
nothing there's nothing that is (59:28 - 59:31)
narrowing it down to what it could be (59:29 - 59:33)
when when sword and shield first came (59:31 - 59:33)
out (59:33 - 59:35)
um there was an issue where the game (59:33 - 59:37)
would crash or you would lose everything (59:35 - 59:40)
right and that was the National dex (59:37 - 59:41)
people back at the time were like (59:40 - 59:43)
looking for anything to throw certain (59:41 - 59:44)
children on the bus because they (59:43 - 59:45)
absolutely hated it and they were like (59:44 - 59:47)
look it they game freak can't even (59:45 - 59:49)
program a proper game and it's crashing (59:47 - 59:51)
there were five other games having the (59:49 - 59:53)
same issue one of them being Super Smash (59:51 - 59:56)
Brothers uh whatever the one on switches (59:53 - 59:57)
I'm sorry I can't remember it because (59:56 - 59:59)
I'm gonna smash but there was Smash (59:57 - 60:01)
Brothers sword and shield and then three (59:59 - 60:02)
other games and it had nothing to do (60:01 - 60:05)
with those games it had to do with (60:02 - 60:06)
people not (60:05 - 60:09)
formatting the SD card in the proper way (60:06 - 60:11)
the SD card needs to be formatted for (60:09 - 60:13)
the Nintendo switch therefore the game (60:11 - 60:15)
data would eventually get corrupted (60:13 - 60:17)
um and again I have no clue if that is (60:15 - 60:19)
related to this update where like maybe (60:17 - 60:21)
their SD card is not formatted correctly (60:19 - 60:25)
and finally the update did that so (60:21 - 60:28)
it it it's tough like there will always (60:25 - 60:31)
be issues with like I remember (60:28 - 60:34)
specifically one of my mods in twitch uh (60:31 - 60:36)
when Pokemon home updated for bdsp and (60:34 - 60:39)
for Legends they went to update it they (60:36 - 60:42)
got completely stuck and it's it bricked (60:39 - 60:44)
their entire switch system they lost (60:42 - 60:46)
everything everything from sword and (60:44 - 60:48)
shield everything from bdsp which (60:46 - 60:49)
probably actually was it was probably a (60:48 - 60:51)
good thing there everything from Legends (60:49 - 60:53)
everything from let's go Pikachu every (60:51 - 60:55)
other non-pokemon game they had they (60:53 - 60:58)
lost because the update to Pokemon home (60:55 - 61:00)
that they were downloading brick to (60:58 - 61:03)
their system and I am sure that happened (61:00 - 61:05)
to other people but I'm also sure that (61:03 - 61:06)
we can't a hundred percent narrow it (61:05 - 61:08)
down to Pokemon home causing that issue (61:06 - 61:11)
it could have just been the SD card (61:08 - 61:13)
failed at that moment in time and that (61:11 - 61:15)
SD card failing when the download (61:13 - 61:17)
happened caused it to brick (61:15 - 61:19)
um again we just spent the first 45 (61:17 - 61:20)
minutes of this episode being like this (61:19 - 61:22)
update didn't seem super great and this (61:20 - 61:25)
update seemed bad (61:22 - 61:25)
but we just don't have enough data here (61:26 - 61:34)
to be like Vivion or the 1.2 update is (61:31 - 61:35)
causing the issue (61:34 - 61:36)
um (61:35 - 61:38)
it sucks it super sucks and hopefully (61:36 - 61:41)
they say something but (61:38 - 61:41)
I I don't know like I don't I are people (61:41 - 61:48)
suddenly getting it now or I mean if (61:44 - 61:50)
people are getting it specifically after (61:48 - 61:51)
updating the 1.2 that would be more (61:50 - 61:53)
realistic because people might not just (61:51 - 61:54)
be updating but like people might have (61:53 - 61:56)
picked the game up after a week and like (61:54 - 61:58)
okay I have to do the update now to log (61:56 - 62:00)
back in (61:58 - 62:02)
um I'm pretty sure all of them have been (62:00 - 62:03)
after 1.2 (62:02 - 62:06)
I'm pretty sure every single one has (62:03 - 62:08)
yeah but it's still a very small number (62:06 - 62:10)
of people (62:08 - 62:11)
right and there's a lot of games that (62:10 - 62:13)
are sold right so like the more people (62:11 - 62:16)
that own the game the more issues you (62:13 - 62:17)
hear from a small amount just because (62:16 - 62:20)
there are more people (62:17 - 62:20)
like what did sword and shield sold like (62:20 - 62:24)
what 26 million and we're three months (62:22 - 62:27)
out and Scarlet Violet have sold 23 (62:24 - 62:31)
million or something insane like that (62:27 - 62:31)
um (62:32 - 62:36)
yeah and I I can't even be like we can't (62:33 - 62:38)
even on the show be like well do this (62:36 - 62:40)
this and this before you start up to (62:38 - 62:42)
ensure like the best performance like I (62:40 - 62:44)
I we don't know (62:42 - 62:48)
like make sure you have a good SD card I (62:44 - 62:50)
have I have no clue (62:48 - 62:51)
um (62:50 - 62:55)
obviously this issue would probably (62:51 - 62:55)
if Pokemon home existed at this point we (62:55 - 63:00)
could be like hey move all your good (62:58 - 63:02)
Pokemon to Pokemon home continue playing (63:00 - 63:05)
the game if it crashed ah at least your (63:02 - 63:07)
Pokemon are safe but Pokemon home (63:05 - 63:08)
doesn't exist right now they said spring (63:07 - 63:11)
and it's not spring yet (63:08 - 63:14)
uh that's my big worry I I want to keep (63:11 - 63:17)
my distribution Pokemon safe (63:14 - 63:19)
yeah (63:17 - 63:19)
yeah I don't know (63:19 - 63:22)
um but it is what it is and hopefully (63:24 - 63:28)
hopefully they acknowledge it hopefully (63:26 - 63:31)
something happens and hopefully maybe (63:28 - 63:34)
those people who've had it happen Can (63:31 - 63:36)
Get It reversed that is the ultimate (63:34 - 63:38)
hope yep (63:36 - 63:38)
I have no hope in reversal (63:39 - 63:42)
as somebody who worked for a big tech (63:43 - 63:46)
tech company for five years and watch (63:45 - 63:48)
people lose their data every single day (63:46 - 63:51)
there's (63:48 - 63:53)
that's fair there's not a lot of (63:51 - 63:55)
reversal that happens when data gets (63:53 - 63:57)
corrupted yeah I mean hopefully maybe (63:55 - 63:59)
hey if there's a cloud something maybe (63:57 - 64:03)
sometimes but rarely no (63:59 - 64:03)
um again that probably leads to a bigger (64:05 - 64:08)
question of like why Pokemon doesn't (64:06 - 64:10)
sync to (64:08 - 64:13)
Nintendo Cloud but yeah there's a lot of (64:10 - 64:14)
questions (64:13 - 64:17)
I think that's also like send all your (64:14 - 64:18)
Pokemon to home restore from the cloud (64:17 - 64:20)
backup 10 minutes ago now you have (64:18 - 64:23)
double of every Pokemon within minutes (64:20 - 64:26)
and they would have to work to implement (64:23 - 64:27)
a system like that why would they do (64:26 - 64:29)
that when they could just charge you 15 (64:27 - 64:34)
a year to use their dedicated system (64:29 - 64:34)
um I don't know (64:34 - 64:40)
I'm not defending it it sucks (64:37 - 64:40)
I I really don't expect a ton of people (64:44 - 64:49)
I don't I don't resp I I don't expect a (64:47 - 64:51)
recovery feature (64:49 - 64:53)
um (64:51 - 64:56)
and I don't (64:53 - 64:56)
I don't remember Greg the Kalos thing (64:56 - 65:02)
when lumio City had that bug where it (64:59 - 65:05)
would crack this reminded me of there (65:02 - 65:06)
was no recovery feature there's no (65:05 - 65:08)
recovery from that yep that was a that (65:06 - 65:11)
was a dead and gone but how long did it (65:08 - 65:14)
take for reports to pop up of like (65:11 - 65:16)
within a week I think it was within a (65:14 - 65:17)
week (65:16 - 65:20)
they acknowledged it pretty fast and (65:17 - 65:22)
then they they fixed it within another (65:20 - 65:24)
week yeah (65:22 - 65:28)
so it's almost been a week since 1.2 (65:24 - 65:32)
so if it is an actual issue with 1.2 (65:28 - 65:32)
hopefully they would acknowledge it this (65:32 - 65:36)
week yeah and then if they did with (65:34 - 65:39)
lumio city that was an easy fix it was (65:36 - 65:44)
don't save in Lumia City (65:39 - 65:44)
don't say I'll save outside in lumiosity (65:45 - 65:49)
because you get to save in (65:47 - 65:52)
the Pokemon Center (65:49 - 65:55)
and it was fine it was yes (65:52 - 65:57)
in the big city and you saved you were (65:55 - 65:59)
boned (65:57 - 66:03)
okay so here's my advice if your game is (65:59 - 66:04)
still working as of this recording just (66:03 - 66:07)
keep saving in that same spot if you end (66:04 - 66:10)
your session (66:07 - 66:10)
there put marks on the floor (66:11 - 66:17)
yeah I mean saving the same spot though (66:15 - 66:18)
I feel like I usually fly to a Pokemon (66:17 - 66:21)
Center and then save there really yeah I (66:18 - 66:25)
say forever I I rarely move (66:21 - 66:28)
so I've been at the same Pokemon Center (66:25 - 66:30)
for a month and a half (66:28 - 66:31)
I'm not sure I've ever saved at a (66:30 - 66:33)
Pokemon Center maybe once during my (66:31 - 66:35)
playthrough I can't yeah I feel like I (66:33 - 66:37)
always get rid of that habit that I have (66:35 - 66:39)
from him so because of the old games you (66:37 - 66:41)
had to be in a Pokemon Center to connect (66:39 - 66:44)
to (66:41 - 66:45)
um (66:44 - 66:49)
and I think it was also Coliseum you had (66:45 - 66:51)
to be in a Pokemon Center (66:49 - 66:54)
uh I just have always saved there and I (66:51 - 66:56)
have never bothered to break that habit (66:54 - 66:58)
because why I usually go heal up and (66:56 - 67:00)
then I'm like well I'm done (66:58 - 67:02)
save there's something I do in Final (67:00 - 67:04)
Fantasy 14 I will fly back to the main (67:02 - 67:07)
city go get my armor repaired (67:04 - 67:09)
and then log out like these are the (67:07 - 67:13)
things that I just do this is my habit (67:09 - 67:13)
yeah I mean I always used to go to the (67:14 - 67:18)
very center of the Pokeball or as close (67:16 - 67:21)
as I could get in the old games and Save (67:18 - 67:23)
in the Pokemon Center but ever since (67:21 - 67:24)
it's been on the switch it's just (67:23 - 67:27)
wherever it's just all bets are off now (67:24 - 67:30)
yeah I think I think in Legends I would (67:27 - 67:32)
always save in the town near the gate (67:30 - 67:33)
yeah (67:32 - 67:36)
huh I would sometimes save in my house (67:33 - 67:38)
oh I never saved in my house because (67:36 - 67:41)
that was like being in a Pokemon Center (67:38 - 67:42)
yeah I think I saved in my house here (67:41 - 67:45)
and there but most of the time no I I (67:42 - 67:47)
had a funny Habit in legends that were (67:45 - 67:50)
whenever I would go to report my Pokedex (67:47 - 67:53)
things or go to report to my higher-ups (67:50 - 67:54)
I would always make sure to go and (67:53 - 67:56)
change back into my uniform before doing (67:54 - 67:58)
that so I went into my house in Legends (67:56 - 68:01)
all the time oh yeah (67:58 - 68:01)
now speaking of your house uh let's talk (68:01 - 68:06)
about Pokemon sleep real quick (68:03 - 68:08)
oh where's my Pokemon sleeping we're (68:06 - 68:09)
skipping over my thoughts on the trailer (68:08 - 68:12)
it's even on the notes oh it's on the (68:09 - 68:15)
notes yeah Greg as I find my sleep notes (68:12 - 68:16)
I don't know where I put them uh what (68:15 - 68:19)
were your thoughts on the the trailer (68:16 - 68:20)
um (68:19 - 68:22)
it was fine I am excited for the new (68:20 - 68:25)
legendaries I'm not excited at fall and (68:22 - 68:30)
winter for timings I'm a little (68:25 - 68:30)
bummed that for like they're both like (68:30 - 68:37)
you got an excited like you're going (68:34 - 68:38)
somewhere else (68:37 - 68:40)
um I'm kind of (68:38 - 68:43)
Matt on the fact that the first one (68:40 - 68:45)
doesn't answer any of the open-ended (68:43 - 68:47)
questions that we have for area zero and (68:45 - 68:49)
that won't that will hopefully happen in (68:47 - 68:52)
winter I find it a little weird that (68:49 - 68:53)
they're like well we're done with Spain (68:52 - 68:54)
we're gonna buy Japan (68:53 - 68:57)
for the first thing like you're now (68:54 - 68:58)
foreign exchange student and we're (68:57 - 68:59)
sending you somewhere completely (68:58 - 69:00)
different they do one of those Johto (68:59 - 69:02)
remakes (69:00 - 69:04)
uh I think (69:02 - 69:06)
the new legendaries look cool I think (69:04 - 69:09)
the Pokemon that they showed look cool (69:06 - 69:11)
um (69:09 - 69:14)
I'm curious if they're gonna follow it (69:11 - 69:16)
feels like they're following sort of the (69:14 - 69:19)
same path of one being more competitive (69:16 - 69:21)
focused and one being more (69:20 - 69:24)
legendary Focus I didn't get a great (69:21 - 69:25)
sense that they're dividing the story (69:24 - 69:27)
lines amongst the two that they're (69:25 - 69:30)
they're similarly following the armor (69:27 - 69:33)
and Crown Tundra feel of them (69:30 - 69:34)
um (69:33 - 69:38)
I think the new outfits are bad (69:34 - 69:41)
uh they're they're nothing burger like (69:38 - 69:42)
the these are you talking about the free (69:41 - 69:45)
outfits yeah free school outfits are bad (69:42 - 69:47)
just more uniforms you have to buy the (69:45 - 69:50)
DLC (69:47 - 69:50)
um I think the new turtle looks great I (69:50 - 69:54)
think the people that are like flipping (69:52 - 69:56)
out that there will not be any new (69:54 - 69:58)
Pokemon types because (69:56 - 70:01)
of the back of a legendary Turtle (69:58 - 70:02)
ignoring the fact that there's stuff on (70:01 - 70:06)
the sides like look people you are you (70:02 - 70:08)
are working yourselves up into a frenzy (70:06 - 70:10)
for no good reason (70:08 - 70:13)
like you were basic things off of (70:10 - 70:15)
nothing (70:13 - 70:18)
um I'm excited for Pokemon concierge I (70:15 - 70:21)
think that looks cute uh I'm (70:18 - 70:23)
very much on the fence about Pokemon (70:21 - 70:24)
sleep (70:23 - 70:28)
uh they broke unite terribly (70:24 - 70:30)
uh uh (70:28 - 70:33)
don't care about Cafe remix I think man (70:30 - 70:34)
if you don't connect Vivian to unite I (70:33 - 70:36)
think it's okay (70:34 - 70:39)
it's not it's so broken right now uh I (70:36 - 70:41)
like the pairs that they introduced for (70:39 - 70:43)
master ZX I think that part was really (70:41 - 70:44)
good (70:43 - 70:47)
um and we'll talk about sleep overall I (70:44 - 70:50)
was oh or I was like oh okay this is (70:47 - 70:53)
this is what I expected exactly from (70:50 - 70:54)
this and there was nothing in there that (70:53 - 70:57)
uh apart from Pokemon concierge which I (70:54 - 70:58)
thought oh you're making (70:57 - 71:01)
you're making something brand new (70:58 - 71:03)
I guess that was cool but everything (71:01 - 71:05)
else is like this is pretty much what I (71:03 - 71:07)
expected and I'm not (71:05 - 71:12)
overly wowed by any of it yeah (71:07 - 71:13)
um (71:12 - 71:14)
I think a lot of people were wowed about (71:13 - 71:16)
sleep I felt sleep was actually 50 50 (71:14 - 71:18)
honestly what a bad transition I felt (71:16 - 71:20)
like either you were into sleep or you (71:18 - 71:21)
were upset that sleep took so much time (71:20 - 71:24)
out of this presents uh you were on (71:21 - 71:27)
either end of the fence so they first (71:24 - 71:31)
announced sleep in May of 2019. it is (71:27 - 71:32)
scheduled to officially launch in summer (71:31 - 71:37)
of 2023 for IOS and Android (71:32 - 71:40)
sorry Windows Phone users (71:37 - 71:43)
um the Pokemon go plus plus is real it's (71:40 - 71:47)
coming out uh it is at the it's big it (71:43 - 71:49)
is (71:47 - 71:52)
obnoxiously big like I mean I've I (71:49 - 71:53)
pre-ordered one because I want the (71:52 - 71:55)
ability to use other balls when I'm (71:53 - 71:58)
walking around the Mall of America and I (71:55 - 72:00)
do not care about catching anymore and (71:58 - 72:01)
the fact that I run out of regular (72:00 - 72:03)
pokeballs since like we're done has (72:01 - 72:05)
always made me mad so I ordered it just (72:03 - 72:07)
for that but (72:05 - 72:11)
the size of it makes me feel (72:07 - 72:14)
self-conscious about I want to hide it (72:11 - 72:16)
in a pocket so that people don't see me (72:14 - 72:18)
clicking this giant weird button all the (72:16 - 72:22)
time I want to see you click it (72:18 - 72:24)
the size of it feels feels good for (72:22 - 72:26)
Pokemon sleep and bad for Pokemon go (72:24 - 72:29)
correct and since I am still iffy about (72:26 - 72:30)
sleep and what they're doing with my (72:29 - 72:32)
privacy data (72:30 - 72:34)
I mean the the PO I have a k I have a (72:32 - 72:37)
case on on this as you can see the cases (72:34 - 72:38)
starting to shift I'm sorry audio (72:37 - 72:39)
listeners I'm just holding up a Pokeball (72:38 - 72:41)
plus the the one for let's go Pikachu (72:39 - 72:44)
let's go Evie this is pretty big though (72:41 - 72:46)
yeah it's big and round and you can hold (72:44 - 72:47)
it easily in the palm of your hands like (72:46 - 72:49)
close it in your hand well yours is too (72:47 - 72:51)
big because you put another thing around (72:49 - 72:53)
it but you could hold it in your hand (72:51 - 72:56)
and it looks like you're holding a tiny (72:53 - 72:58)
ball like it it is hidden in the palm of (72:56 - 73:01)
your head this thing does not easily it (72:58 - 73:02)
is the size of the pulp of your hand (73:01 - 73:05)
from what I can tell that big is it they (73:02 - 73:07)
got measurements I thought we were going (73:05 - 73:09)
to talk about the price not the size of (73:07 - 73:11)
the prices the price is another thing (73:09 - 73:14)
altogether it's overpriced but (73:11 - 73:17)
it is it is a big chunky (73:14 - 73:20)
thing (73:17 - 73:20)
ah it's using it for Pokemon sleep I'm (73:20 - 73:25)
I'm comfortable with the size using it (73:22 - 73:27)
for Pokemon go it's gonna be a little (73:25 - 73:29)
inconvenient except for the fact that it (73:27 - 73:31)
sounds like it will be able to Auto (73:29 - 73:33)
throw normal Pokeballs (73:31 - 73:35)
so if I'm going to use normal pokeballs (73:33 - 73:37)
I think I could just put it in a bag or (73:35 - 73:39)
put it in a pocket if I had Pockets that (73:37 - 73:41)
size (73:39 - 73:46)
I mean it's two and a half inches (73:41 - 73:46)
in diameter (73:46 - 73:51)
that's big (73:48 - 73:53)
yes (73:51 - 73:55)
um (73:53 - 73:58)
it weighs uh 0.29 pounds and it's thick (73:55 - 74:01)
is big and it's thick so it is more (73:58 - 74:02)
expensive than I thought it was going to (74:01 - 74:05)
be if we if we recall the the Pokeball (74:02 - 74:09)
Pokemon go plus which is uh uh Hannah as (74:05 - 74:11)
being featured here again sorry audio (74:09 - 74:13)
listeners it's just the you don't have (74:11 - 74:15)
to you can come to YouTube if you want (74:13 - 74:17)
it's just the Pokeball we've seen it for (74:15 - 74:20)
like seven years you've seen it that (74:17 - 74:22)
device was 35 originally when it came (74:20 - 74:23)
out (74:22 - 74:25)
and if you remember correctly it sold (74:23 - 74:28)
out instantly it sold out everywhere (74:25 - 74:30)
yeah and it instantly went up to a (74:28 - 74:32)
hundred 120 on eBay and stuff now the (74:30 - 74:35)
nice thing about that device is you (74:32 - 74:37)
could just order a German one or a (74:35 - 74:39)
Japanese one or a Korean one because (74:37 - 74:41)
they were exactly the same the only (74:39 - 74:44)
thing difference was the box it came in (74:41 - 74:46)
um there were fake ones that went around (74:44 - 74:49)
um at some point but uh (74:46 - 74:52)
they're impossible to find now uh it was (74:49 - 74:55)
introduced seven years ago Pokemon go (74:52 - 74:58)
seven years I think old maybe hearing it (74:55 - 74:59)
yeah (74:58 - 75:00)
um and then when let's go Pikachu let's (74:59 - 75:03)
go Evie came out the Pokemon go the (75:00 - 75:05)
Pokeball plus these names are very (75:03 - 75:08)
cleverly that came out and that worked (75:05 - 75:11)
with Pokemon go and that was fifty (75:08 - 75:12)
dollars (75:11 - 75:15)
fifteen dollars more expensive (75:12 - 75:17)
on the flip side though uh it's a whole (75:15 - 75:20)
controller it's a whole yeah it's a it's (75:17 - 75:22)
a whole it's a whole joy-con it worked (75:20 - 75:24)
with poke it was a whole controller that (75:22 - 75:26)
worked and it had a Mew in it (75:24 - 75:29)
and it had a mu in it that was the (75:26 - 75:34)
controversy of paying 35 50 from you (75:29 - 75:36)
we cannot go down that argument again (75:34 - 75:37)
we're not going back into that (75:36 - 75:39)
those people are wrong (75:37 - 75:42)
um now this is 55 and I will say (75:39 - 75:46)
uh I'm very happy that it has USBC which (75:42 - 75:50)
the Pokeball yes go plus also had USBC (75:46 - 75:52)
um I would always pay extra for that (75:50 - 75:55)
instead of what what micro USB or (75:52 - 75:57)
whatever people are using (75:55 - 76:00)
um this does have sleep sensing in it I (75:57 - 76:02)
don't know how much that was worth uh (76:00 - 76:03)
but obviously this can still go under (76:02 - 76:05)
your pillow you don't need a whole lot (76:03 - 76:08)
for Sleep sensing and then you have the (76:05 - 76:10)
one to your pillow or is it supposed to (76:08 - 76:13)
go just next to you (76:10 - 76:13)
yeah (76:20 - 76:24)
and my concern is I have dogs so I was (76:21 - 76:26)
gonna register my dogs walking around on (76:24 - 76:28)
the bed as me now he's gonna eat it (76:26 - 76:31)
isn't he no he's like like chew on it (76:28 - 76:32)
like pick it up and take it something (76:31 - 76:35)
why would they they don't grab our stuff (76:32 - 76:38)
well Kaiju grabs gloves but they don't (76:35 - 76:40)
tend to like they've never shown any (76:38 - 76:41)
interest in like I'm gonna bite that (76:40 - 76:43)
controller or I'm gonna eat those wires (76:41 - 76:46)
like they do have a sense of like that's (76:43 - 76:49)
not what the thing they should do (76:46 - 76:49)
um they're not cats (76:50 - 76:53)
the whole like it can use Great Balls (76:54 - 76:59)
Ultra Balls that that has nothing to do (76:57 - 77:00)
with the price that's just a that's just (76:59 - 77:02)
like that's just finally fixing that's (77:00 - 77:03)
finally fixing a bug for as far as I'm (77:02 - 77:05)
concerned but of course it got me to buy (77:03 - 77:06)
it (77:05 - 77:08)
um and apparently there's a speaker in (77:06 - 77:11)
it too which you could say the Pokeball (77:08 - 77:13)
the the first one doesn't have any sound (77:11 - 77:14)
right I don't remember it no I think it (77:13 - 77:17)
vibrates whatever it does vibrate the (77:14 - 77:19)
the Pokeball (77:17 - 77:20)
Plus (77:19 - 77:22)
it would light up per which Pokemon you (77:20 - 77:24)
I don't know if people knew this but if (77:22 - 77:25)
you put like a Pikachu in it would get (77:24 - 77:26)
light up yellow if you put like a (77:25 - 77:27)
Bulbasaur in it would light up green I (77:26 - 77:28)
don't know if anyone actually knew that (77:27 - 77:30)
but that worked (77:28 - 77:30)
um (77:30 - 77:32)
uh it would also have the Pokemon's cry (77:30 - 77:35)
so if you put zashian in it I actually (77:32 - 77:36)
don't know what colors ashine would (77:35 - 77:38)
light up I would assume like a silver (77:36 - 77:41)
but maybe a blue uh but it would make (77:38 - 77:43)
zashians cry (77:41 - 77:46)
um and then all they all vibrate I'm (77:43 - 77:47)
assuming this vibrates it doesn't (77:46 - 77:48)
actually say if this vibrates I'm (77:47 - 77:51)
assuming this vibrates though (77:48 - 77:53)
probably for Pokemon go hopefully not (77:51 - 77:55)
for Pokemon sleep (77:53 - 77:57)
unless it vibrates to wake you up (77:55 - 77:59)
is that there's gonna be an alarm (77:57 - 78:01)
function yeah yeah they said that they (77:59 - 78:03)
said that Pikachu will you wake you up (78:01 - 78:05)
he'll go like pika pika and that you can (78:03 - 78:07)
earn different alarms as you play the (78:05 - 78:09)
game yeah (78:07 - 78:10)
um (78:09 - 78:13)
so now that gosh this device is Big (78:10 - 78:15)
maybe that girl's hand is just very tiny (78:13 - 78:18)
no she is seven foot eight (78:15 - 78:22)
[Laughter] (78:18 - 78:24)
um so it sounds like we all got it it (78:22 - 78:26)
did sell out instantly the first day and (78:24 - 78:28)
then finally GameStop and Target got (78:26 - 78:30)
them in stock as of recording this (78:28 - 78:33)
GameStop still has pre-orders open (78:30 - 78:35)
um it's supposed to come out July 14th (78:33 - 78:37)
or July 15th (78:35 - 78:38)
um (78:37 - 78:40)
I did pre-order a couple just because I (78:38 - 78:43)
do think once it I I think obviously you (78:40 - 78:44)
can pre-order it right now at least of (78:43 - 78:46)
this recording but I do think the (78:44 - 78:48)
impulse buy for go players once it's in (78:46 - 78:51)
a store will make it hard to find yeah (78:48 - 78:53)
um for maybe a month or two so if you (78:51 - 78:55)
are a go player or if you really want to (78:53 - 78:56)
get into sleep I do encourage (78:55 - 78:58)
pre-ordering it I don't work for the PO (78:56 - 79:00)
I'm getting no commission off this I'm (78:58 - 79:02)
just saying if if you're looking (79:00 - 79:04)
for this device (79:02 - 79:07)
maybe pre-order it because based on the (79:04 - 79:09)
last two devices (79:07 - 79:11)
they were hard to find otherwise for (79:09 - 79:13)
quite a while and then when they were (79:11 - 79:15)
easier to find (79:13 - 79:18)
they became hard to find very quickly (79:15 - 79:21)
after uh so 55 dollars (79:18 - 79:24)
is is is is a bit of money (79:21 - 79:26)
um but you're getting a physical (79:24 - 79:29)
Hardware device that works with at least (79:26 - 79:32)
we know two apps and one app it's pretty (79:29 - 79:36)
important for us which is the sleep app (79:32 - 79:39)
an Easy Pass though if you don't play (79:36 - 79:40)
Pokemon go or you don't plan on playing (79:39 - 79:42)
Pokemon sleep a very easy save your (79:40 - 79:44)
fifty five dollars (79:42 - 79:45)
um (79:44 - 79:48)
I think sleep is exactly what I thought (79:45 - 79:49)
they were going to show though like when (79:48 - 79:51)
they showed it I was like yeah there is (79:49 - 79:54)
no surprises here like yep you you (79:51 - 79:57)
unlock different Pokemon yep uh it can (79:54 - 79:59)
wake you up yep you get a bar graph when (79:57 - 80:00)
you're done (79:59 - 80:03)
um it's cool that like you get a free (80:00 - 80:06)
Snorlax with a sleep cap and Pokemon go (80:03 - 80:10)
I guess 50. fifty five dollars (80:06 - 80:10)
oh come on (80:11 - 80:17)
give us (80:14 - 80:19)
uh so yeah if you want to relax in the (80:17 - 80:22)
Hat I don't know 55 for just that (80:19 - 80:24)
um anyways (80:22 - 80:28)
uh I I hope there's more surprises with (80:24 - 80:30)
sleep I hope I've said that there will (80:28 - 80:32)
be other functionality related to (80:30 - 80:33)
Pokemon go (80:32 - 80:36)
oh okay they have said that that was in (80:33 - 80:38)
the trailer no idea what it's gonna be (80:36 - 80:40)
but there is going to be more sleep (80:38 - 80:42)
functionality related to Pokemon go (80:40 - 80:46)
that is coming I think her hand is Tiny (80:42 - 80:51)
her she is eight foot seven (80:46 - 80:51)
she's holding a plate (80:51 - 80:56)
is exactly what I expected it to be yeah (80:54 - 80:59)
and I wish they hadn't changed the logo (80:56 - 81:01)
oh yeah I'm confused that's why it's (80:59 - 81:03)
only the first two generations of (81:01 - 81:05)
Pokemon for the most part (81:03 - 81:07)
you gotta pay extra Hannah you gotta pay (81:05 - 81:12)
oh wait maybe that is actually true (81:07 - 81:12)
and I will I won my sleep (81:17 - 81:22)
get trying to make a very low hanging (81:20 - 81:23)
fruit joke about paying for extra (81:22 - 81:26)
Pokemon but there's no way this game (81:23 - 81:28)
doesn't have Micro transactions this is (81:26 - 81:31)
a micro transaction banana well they (81:28 - 81:32)
could give it to you for free because (81:31 - 81:34)
they're selling your life's blood to (81:32 - 81:36)
Corporate America yeah yeah but even (81:34 - 81:38)
Magikarp jump I think I think was free (81:36 - 81:39)
right (81:38 - 81:42)
what was the logo before (81:39 - 81:44)
uh it was I don't it didn't have the (81:42 - 81:47)
Snorlax in it it wasn't as blue (81:44 - 81:49)
um Magikarp jump I think I only put five (81:47 - 81:52)
or maybe six dollars into there was like (81:49 - 81:55)
a uh like first week package like (81:52 - 81:57)
welcome kit or something that was like (81:55 - 81:59)
five bucks and I think I bought that you (81:57 - 82:02)
always fall for that Chef oh look (81:59 - 82:05)
I would always fall for like this gets (82:02 - 82:06)
me nothing (82:05 - 82:07)
but I'm gonna pay five dollars because (82:06 - 82:10)
you are the Pokemon I don't remember (82:07 - 82:12)
what it gave me but because I gave them (82:10 - 82:14)
five dollars (82:12 - 82:16)
Pokemon company (82:14 - 82:16)
and they were like look it this this (82:17 - 82:21)
dude gave him five dollars make Pokemon (82:19 - 82:23)
sleep we you've made five dollars from (82:21 - 82:26)
this app and this one guy we we we trust (82:23 - 82:28)
you with more Pokemon software that was (82:26 - 82:30)
me I did that I made Pokemon sleep a (82:28 - 82:32)
reality because I supported this is how (82:30 - 82:34)
that conversation went (82:32 - 82:36)
there are suckers who'll pay for this oh (82:34 - 82:38)
absolutely you think we can sucker them (82:36 - 82:41)
into other things four sure they paid (82:38 - 82:43)
five dollars for a game where all you do (82:41 - 82:45)
is jump and you could have just done (82:43 - 82:48)
that for free just for free you can go (82:45 - 82:50)
and feed fish and make them jump out of (82:48 - 82:53)
the water literally for free at any Lake (82:50 - 82:56)
in a large upper Midwestern area but (82:53 - 82:58)
this sucker said yeah I'll pay five (82:56 - 83:01)
dollars for that I'll play it for two (82:58 - 83:03)
days five dollars (83:01 - 83:05)
I'll throw it out of fire of course yeah (83:03 - 83:07)
I don't know what micro transactions (83:05 - 83:10)
sleep up to one million percent Magikarp (83:07 - 83:13)
Magikarp jump is a top 20 Pokemon game (83:10 - 83:16)
and there's probably at least 80 Pokemon (83:13 - 83:18)
games (83:16 - 83:20)
a lot of people do have fond memories of (83:18 - 83:22)
it (83:20 - 83:25)
a good time for a short while I would I (83:22 - 83:27)
would play Magic if I was forced an (83:25 - 83:30)
island my choices were Coliseum Gale of (83:27 - 83:33)
darkness and Magikarp jump I don't even (83:30 - 83:35)
think about it Magikarp jump is the game (83:33 - 83:37)
I'm picking (83:35 - 83:41)
a blue Magikarp in that game it's tight (83:37 - 83:41)
stuff gonna come to scarlet and violet (83:44 - 83:47)
when can I get different those are all (83:45 - 83:49)
regional forms that they aren't telling (83:47 - 83:51)
you about (83:49 - 83:51)
um I'm excited for sleep I think I think (83:52 - 83:55)
that's (83:54 - 83:56)
um (83:55 - 83:58)
one other thing about sleep that I'm (83:56 - 84:01)
curious about is that they say that you (83:58 - 84:04)
can get these different Pokemon by (84:01 - 84:07)
sleeping in different sleeping Styles (84:04 - 84:09)
and I'm very curious if you're someone (84:07 - 84:12)
who just sleeps consistently in the same (84:09 - 84:14)
way which is supposedly the best way to (84:12 - 84:16)
sleep if you're gonna be bad at this (84:14 - 84:19)
game yeah what does that mean (84:16 - 84:21)
what is sleeping no different sleeping (84:19 - 84:23)
Styles mean I don't know no idea there's (84:21 - 84:25)
you must there's a lot like how would it (84:23 - 84:26)
know (84:25 - 84:29)
well different timing different uh (84:26 - 84:30)
movement (84:29 - 84:32)
so I have (84:30 - 84:35)
the Google (84:32 - 84:35)
uh I don't even know what they're called (84:35 - 84:40)
Nest display two (84:37 - 84:42)
that has sleep tracking in it (84:40 - 84:46)
so it so the Google Nest display I don't (84:42 - 84:47)
even know what they're called they're (84:46 - 84:49)
like they're they're it's like the eye (84:47 - 84:51)
it looks like a tiny iPad that's like (84:49 - 84:53)
stuck (84:51 - 84:54)
that you can't pick up and move because (84:53 - 84:56)
it plugs into the wall directly there's (84:54 - 84:57)
like and then it shows you like your (84:56 - 85:00)
lights are on or you can be like uh hey (84:57 - 85:02)
I don't want to activate people's things (85:00 - 85:05)
you'd be like hey thingy like turn up (85:02 - 85:08)
the temperature in the house right and (85:05 - 85:09)
it shows you a few doors are unlocked it (85:08 - 85:10)
shows you all that the second one that (85:09 - 85:13)
it came out with had sleep sensing in it (85:10 - 85:15)
so there's a little sensor at the top (85:13 - 85:16)
and there's like a little plastic switch (85:15 - 85:18)
you can technically cover it with if (85:16 - 85:20)
you're concerned about privacy not that (85:18 - 85:21)
that matters Google already knows (85:20 - 85:22)
everything about you (85:21 - 85:23)
um (85:22 - 85:27)
uh that it watches you sleep and then in (85:23 - 85:29)
the morning it'll say like it's pretty (85:27 - 85:32)
accurate too it'll it'll say like you (85:29 - 85:34)
moved around from here it sends it to (85:32 - 85:36)
your phone camera or is it just not a (85:34 - 85:41)
camera okay it's like uh sure IR oh (85:36 - 85:42)
motion sensor kind of thing yeah it's (85:41 - 85:44)
like a motion sensor thing (85:42 - 85:48)
um it's not a camera wink wink uh but (85:44 - 85:50)
it's pretty accurate except for the fact (85:48 - 85:54)
that like sometimes if I got up (85:50 - 85:57)
it would read the other person and still (85:54 - 85:59)
think I'm sleeping right because it's (85:57 - 86:02)
it's just looking across the bed (85:59 - 86:04)
um and then sometimes it would be like (86:02 - 86:07)
you moved a lot and I was like no that (86:04 - 86:09)
was my cat yeah that kept like running I (86:07 - 86:12)
have dogs right that's the reason that (86:09 - 86:13)
the most accurate sleep trackers are (86:12 - 86:15)
gonna be something like an apple watch (86:13 - 86:17)
or something like a ring things that are (86:15 - 86:19)
on your person specifically yeah and (86:17 - 86:21)
this is not going to beat that it's not (86:19 - 86:23)
going to be as accurate as things like (86:21 - 86:26)
that yeah and I I was pretty like okay (86:23 - 86:28)
with it for like a week or two and then (86:26 - 86:30)
I just stopped looking at it because I (86:28 - 86:32)
couldn't I couldn't do anything with the (86:30 - 86:35)
data like you slept terribly I didn't (86:32 - 86:37)
need you to tell me that I know I'm (86:35 - 86:41)
terrible right now I feel bad thanks and (86:37 - 86:44)
it's like we'll sleep better like how (86:41 - 86:48)
Okay uh I didn't like like I'm sorry I (86:44 - 86:50)
got into a fist fight at Target today I (86:48 - 86:51)
don't know how to sleep better after (86:50 - 86:52)
that like you know what I mean it's just (86:51 - 86:54)
like you can't it's like we'll sleep (86:52 - 86:55)
better it's like well my day was super (86:54 - 86:57)
stressful I don't know how to not have a (86:55 - 86:58)
super stressful day and then think about (86:57 - 87:00)
it before I'm falling asleep right (86:58 - 87:03)
um that being said you know I've tried (87:00 - 87:04)
sleep things in the past I've tried to (87:03 - 87:07)
wear like a wristband thing to bed (87:04 - 87:09)
um I've tried the app I can't sleep with (87:07 - 87:10)
an Apple Watch I just I just some people (87:09 - 87:15)
can I cannot I am a person I learned (87:10 - 87:16)
this with earrings (87:15 - 87:19)
and I learned this with rings that I (87:16 - 87:20)
will take them off in the middle of my (87:19 - 87:22)
in the night (87:20 - 87:24)
because I'm tired I'm asleep but I'm (87:22 - 87:25)
like why are these things here and I (87:24 - 87:28)
will rip them off I rip earrings out of (87:25 - 87:33)
my ears rings off my fingers I like I (87:28 - 87:35)
need to be in a very specific way and (87:33 - 87:38)
like having something on my wrist is a (87:35 - 87:40)
no-go because I can't pull it off and (87:38 - 87:43)
Chuck it across the room (87:40 - 87:43)
um so I am excited for sleep but I like (87:44 - 87:49)
I said on the show probably a couple (87:48 - 87:51)
weeks ago I'm more excited just for the (87:49 - 87:53)
plus plus itself (87:51 - 87:55)
um because even if sleep is a bust for (87:53 - 87:56)
me I feel like I still have this product (87:55 - 87:59)
I can use with another app (87:56 - 88:01)
um and it's nice that they did make some (87:59 - 88:03)
improvements to it (88:01 - 88:05)
yeah (88:03 - 88:07)
uh so I guess I guess we'll I guess (88:05 - 88:09)
we'll see I I can I'll compare the the (88:07 - 88:11)
plus plus to the Google thingy I don't (88:09 - 88:12)
even know what the Google thing is (88:11 - 88:14)
called but I'll I'll compare it probably (88:12 - 88:17)
is yeah probably I don't know what they (88:14 - 88:19)
call it Google snooze (88:17 - 88:21)
um (88:19 - 88:22)
all right last bit of news here I know (88:21 - 88:24)
there's a bunch of news I know we really (88:22 - 88:25)
didn't talk about unite or anything like (88:24 - 88:27)
that it's just you know it's broken well (88:25 - 88:29)
it's it's almost slightly fixed now (88:27 - 88:30)
because they did finally put an (88:29 - 88:33)
emergency hot fix in production (88:30 - 88:36)
the old emergency hot effects yeah (88:33 - 88:40)
because it was bugged (88:36 - 88:40)
we're I think we're three for three for (88:40 - 88:44)
pretty good Community days this year (88:42 - 88:46)
um knowing that we might also get (88:44 - 88:48)
Fennekin and we also might get Froakie (88:46 - 88:49)
which (88:48 - 88:51)
all right look I know there's like 20 (88:49 - 88:53)
people out there like Fennekin but a lot (88:51 - 88:55)
of people like Froakie like Greninja is (88:53 - 88:58)
very authenics is very popular (88:55 - 89:01)
uh I think this is a great Community (88:58 - 89:03)
um this is the Slowpoke and gallerian (89:01 - 89:05)
Slowpoke Community Day on March 18th (89:03 - 89:07)
from two to five and I think this (89:05 - 89:09)
commute day would have been a big bus (89:07 - 89:12)
for a lot of people if it was just (89:09 - 89:15)
Slowpoke yeah but I think doing both is (89:12 - 89:17)
is way way more exciting and I think way (89:15 - 89:19)
more fun and I think it does keep people (89:17 - 89:21)
out longer (89:19 - 89:23)
um I think they could have gotten away (89:21 - 89:24)
with just Slowpoke because you got slow (89:23 - 89:26)
poke slow bro slow King and then you got (89:24 - 89:27)
Mega Slowbro (89:26 - 89:29)
um also just a fun fact I saw people (89:27 - 89:30)
being like (89:29 - 89:32)
oh when Slowbro evolves into slow King (89:30 - 89:34)
it doesn't get as cool they they they (89:32 - 89:37)
don't evolve let's let's uh just a (89:34 - 89:41)
reminder that it split Evolution here (89:37 - 89:42)
um (89:41 - 89:45)
so you get slow poke into slow bro or (89:42 - 89:47)
slow poke in a slow King and then you (89:45 - 89:50)
get gallerian slow poke into galerian (89:47 - 89:52)
Slowking and glarion's slow poke into (89:50 - 89:54)
glaring slow bro and then you get on top (89:52 - 89:58)
of Mega Slowbro which cannot come from (89:54 - 90:01)
gallerian Slowbro only from yeah so (89:58 - 90:03)
there's a lot I don't think they needed (90:01 - 90:06)
to do both but I I think doing both is a (90:03 - 90:08)
huge W I think I think that's like the (90:06 - 90:10)
best way to do it it's very exciting (90:08 - 90:14)
um Slowpoke is a terrible shiny yeah (90:10 - 90:17)
um slow bro slow King galerian Slowpoke (90:14 - 90:19)
gallerian Evolutions all good Chinese (90:17 - 90:21)
very very good Slowpoke itself is bad (90:19 - 90:24)
though yeah um (90:21 - 90:27)
well not the exclusive move surf for one (90:24 - 90:29)
dollar you can get access to the (90:27 - 90:31)
storyline uh three times catch catching (90:29 - 90:33)
XP which is really good because Slowpoke (90:31 - 90:36)
is great for excellent throws (90:33 - 90:39)
um Twice The Candy for trainers over (90:36 - 90:41)
level 31 incense will last three hours (90:39 - 90:44)
an additional special trade for a (90:41 - 90:46)
maximum of two Twice The Catch candy (90:44 - 90:48)
lure modules straight from the one (90:46 - 90:51)
dollar into the free things and you'd be (90:48 - 90:53)
worried that the catch candy and XP was (90:51 - 90:54)
going to be launched behind a dollar (90:53 - 90:56)
there for a second I was reading the (90:54 - 90:58)
event bonuses that had nothing to do (90:56 - 90:59)
with the one we don't know what the one (90:58 - 91:01)
dollar comes with yet yeah the one (90:59 - 91:03)
dollar is just the research numbers are (91:01 - 91:05)
still there for free it is it is do a (91:03 - 91:08)
story to get the exact same Pokemon that (91:05 - 91:10)
is spawning currently in the wild yeah (91:08 - 91:12)
but it's higher IVs so if you care about (91:10 - 91:15)
that that's a guarantee (91:12 - 91:18)
come on this is basic 101 higher IVs (91:15 - 91:20)
lure modules will last three hours you (91:18 - 91:22)
get snapshot who will be the surprise (91:20 - 91:24)
during the snapshot Greg who will be the (91:22 - 91:26)
Super fries man I hope it's Pikachu in a (91:24 - 91:28)
gallerian Slowpoke hat (91:26 - 91:31)
trades will require 50 less here's (91:28 - 91:33)
here's why (91:31 - 91:35)
here's why this whole episode has been (91:33 - 91:38)
like people are wrong right you know (91:35 - 91:40)
here's what yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (91:38 - 91:43)
yeah yeah yeah totally totally it's a (91:40 - 91:44)
hundred percent right (91:43 - 91:46)
um here's what Niantic should do they (91:44 - 91:48)
can't do it though because because (91:46 - 91:50)
people are constantly wrong and they (91:48 - 91:52)
don't appreciate fun and the reason I (91:50 - 91:54)
say this (91:52 - 91:58)
is because during the Hoenn tour there (91:54 - 92:00)
were these spooky ciphers and they were (91:58 - 92:02)
great they were they were field (92:00 - 92:05)
researchers that had like little X's (92:02 - 92:07)
you're shaking your head no they're not (92:05 - 92:09)
they were not great they were fun there (92:07 - 92:12)
was only four of them once you figured (92:09 - 92:15)
them out it was like have the lowest bar (92:12 - 92:18)
of fun when it comes to Pokemon that (92:15 - 92:21)
anybody else I know (92:18 - 92:25)
ain't fun it's sprayed acid in my face (92:21 - 92:28)
it's fun it was Pokemon acid spray I (92:25 - 92:31)
loved it it lowered (92:28 - 92:31)
are you both shaking your head you only (92:34 - 92:38)
look slightly disfigured what's your (92:36 - 92:41)
problem it's Pokemon it's fun (92:38 - 92:45)
come on down okay the spooky Cipher I (92:41 - 92:47)
thought was like a very clever like kind (92:45 - 92:51)
of cute like there was only four of them (92:47 - 92:53)
I will give you kind of cute (92:51 - 92:56)
they were cooler if they hadn't had (92:53 - 92:58)
things go wrong and look almost exactly (92:56 - 93:00)
like that before when they were glitchy (92:58 - 93:03)
correct okay okay so let's pretend we (93:00 - 93:05)
all agreed that the spooky Cipher was a (93:03 - 93:06)
great idea it was very cute and very (93:05 - 93:08)
thematic to the spooky Pokemon they they (93:06 - 93:10)
assigned to because I think all of them (93:08 - 93:11)
gave like Sableye or disco these (93:10 - 93:13)
headphones keep making my hair pop up (93:11 - 93:14)
and I hate it (93:13 - 93:16)
um uh (93:14 - 93:18)
what they should do for Slowpoke (93:16 - 93:21)
Community Day is they should start it an (93:18 - 93:24)
hour late and that would be great and (93:21 - 93:27)
thematic and fun but we can't have fun (93:24 - 93:30)
because Niantic messes up too much and (93:27 - 93:31)
people would complain but Slowpoke (93:30 - 93:34)
Community should start late because that (93:31 - 93:38)
makes sense and that would be fun but (93:34 - 93:41)
people would be like it's 2 15 where the (93:38 - 93:44)
Slowpoke but it would it would make so (93:41 - 93:48)
much sense it would be good (93:44 - 93:48)
I'm also into that too like you you how (93:55 - 94:03)
in what universe is that (93:59 - 94:06)
fun wait what Universe it's like hey can (94:03 - 94:08)
you come over and help me move at four (94:06 - 94:12)
sure you show up at five I'm just a slow (94:08 - 94:15)
folk I'm wacky fun you need to be here (94:12 - 94:18)
an hour ago I was counting on you (94:15 - 94:21)
what is that what is that fun how is (94:18 - 94:24)
that fun I ruined your expectations and (94:21 - 94:27)
your day I'm wacky fun (94:24 - 94:32)
yes ah that was the issue that's the (94:27 - 94:34)
issue is clear communication the issue (94:32 - 94:37)
communication (94:34 - 94:39)
sometimes when you're working with a (94:37 - 94:41)
client like Slowpoke you you have the (94:39 - 94:42)
expectation that you might be a little (94:41 - 94:45)
late no if they announced that it would (94:42 - 94:47)
be an hour later then that might be kind (94:45 - 94:49)
of funny there is no person that enjoys (94:47 - 94:52)
working with a client who constantly is (94:49 - 94:55)
an hour behind deadlines (94:52 - 94:55)
show do you think after 27 years (94:57 - 95:01)
Slowpoke is good just suddenly gonna be (94:59 - 95:03)
this is why people tell Slowpoke your (95:01 - 95:05)
community starts at 8am (95:03 - 95:07)
you lied to these people you lie to (95:05 - 95:09)
those clients believe me we have lied to (95:07 - 95:11)
you about start times things it helps (95:09 - 95:14)
that you might show up on time I am I am (95:11 - 95:17)
frequently late yeah that's true so this (95:14 - 95:19)
is what I need to be on time will was (95:17 - 95:21)
like hey can we go to the airport I was (95:19 - 95:24)
there 20 minutes early he was shocked I (95:21 - 95:25)
was like I don't mess around he was Shaq (95:24 - 95:28)
tells everybody listen to this what you (95:25 - 95:29)
need to know (95:28 - 95:32)
because most likely will told you an (95:29 - 95:34)
earlier time (95:32 - 95:36)
yeah maybe maybe I I was so early I had (95:34 - 95:38)
time to get coffee and then go to Will's (95:36 - 95:40)
house I was I was I was (95:38 - 95:42)
if you need to get to the airport I'll (95:40 - 95:44)
get you to the airport on time I'm just (95:42 - 95:46)
saying that's where that's where the (95:44 - 95:48)
reliability comes in (95:46 - 95:51)
uh anyways uh Slowpoke is the community (95:48 - 95:53)
uh and also they'll do the four-star (95:51 - 95:55)
raid things again where Slowpoke will (95:53 - 95:57)
show up in four star raids you defeat (95:55 - 95:59)
them which I may need because I might (95:57 - 96:02)
end up showing up late to this one oh (95:59 - 96:05)
you're the Slowpoke I have an (96:02 - 96:08)
appointment at one o'clock (96:05 - 96:10)

were talking about how like the cool (98:11 - 98:15)
domains like dot bike well that bike's (98:12 - 98:16)
not that cool but like dot cool that (98:15 - 98:18)
bike that whatever like they're always (98:16 - 98:20)
really cheap for the first year (98:18 - 98:22)
they're like 99 Cents but then the (98:20 - 98:25)
second year they're like 40 or 50 a year (98:22 - 98:28)
but they get you in that first year real (98:25 - 98:29)
cheap (98:28 - 98:33)
ise.cash is still works as well which I (98:29 - 98:34)
got scammed into that one it was a (98:33 - 98:35)
dollar for the first year now it's like (98:34 - 98:37)
forty dollars a year to keep the dot (98:35 - 98:38)
cash but (98:37 - 98:40)
I've been saying it too long I gotta (98:38 - 98:42)
commit you don't have to you can just (98:40 - 98:44)
say it's being you can do the the (98:42 - 98:46)
groundwork of saying I'm shutting it (98:44 - 98:48)
down because they are charging me too (98:46 - 98:50)
much cash (98:48 - 98:50)
and they will probably rediscount you (98:52 - 98:56)
for a year that's true I just did that (98:54 - 98:59)
with Adobe uh I I was not actually (98:56 - 99:01)
