Oh (0:12 - 0:14)
what's up everyone welcome to the 214 (0:20 - 0:27)
episode of the Pokemon podcasts it's (0:24 - 0:32)
super effective the premier podcast of (0:27 - 0:37)
pocket arguably that delightful Voice (0:32 - 0:39)
you heard is wait did I say I'm SBJ I (0:37 - 0:42)
didn't say that I'm your host SBJ and (0:39 - 0:45)
were so rudely interrupted the zeros (0:42 - 0:47)
were rudely interrupted by the one and (0:45 - 0:52)
only the trance of you allergist Travis (0:47 - 0:55)
recently tweeted asking polling people (0:52 - 0:57)
how that how they listen to the show (0:55 - 1:00)
what pod catcher they used to listen to (0:57 - 1:01)
the show but the question was just (1:00 - 1:04)
worded how do you listen to the show so (1:01 - 1:06)
my answer to that is usually a week late (1:04 - 1:11)
o mine was through my ears very clever (1:06 - 1:14)
the interesting thing about Twitter (1:11 - 1:17)
polls is you can only have four off yeah (1:14 - 1:19)
it's also annoying because tweetdeck (1:17 - 1:21)
doesn't read them and I that's what I (1:19 - 1:23)
use so if I ever want to participate in (1:21 - 1:25)
those it also doesn't isn't very clear (1:23 - 1:28)
that a poll is even attached to a given (1:25 - 1:31)
tweet but whatever yeah teapots the same (1:28 - 1:33)
way yeah I asked the people who make (1:31 - 1:35)
tweet pot because they're usually on top (1:33 - 1:38)
of the third party Twitter apps and they (1:35 - 1:40)
said that Twitter never gave anyone the (1:38 - 1:43)
API for polls so they can't I would (1:40 - 1:44)
assume that's for everyone so they can't (1:43 - 1:46)
actually like and put it in their app (1:44 - 1:49)
until Twitter releases the API and who (1:46 - 1:50)
knows if Twitter's that we're going to (1:49 - 1:52)
do that but itunes 1 by the way with (1:50 - 1:54)
seventy-six percent of people saying (1:52 - 1:56)
they listen on itunes twelve percent on (1:54 - 1:57)
soundcloud seven percent on google play (1:56 - 2:00)
music which is news in itself that we (1:57 - 2:02)
are on google play music now cut by five (2:00 - 2:05)
percent on stitcher radio and i forgot (2:02 - 2:07)
to introduce will but he is also here do (2:05 - 2:10)
i have to roll a d20 for initiative in (2:07 - 2:13)
order for us to get more as popular as (2:10 - 2:16)
our founding program dungeons and dragon (2:13 - 2:19)
i'ts DC's gonna be pretty the DC is (2:16 - 2:21)
gonna be pretty high but yeah you have (2:19 - 2:24)
to DC is but i gotta i gotta roll them (2:21 - 2:27)
bones got to get us up there cuz i'm not (2:24 - 2:29)
on dungeons and dragon i'ts so now i'm (2:27 - 2:30)
jealous you're jealous that you're not (2:29 - 2:33)
on and that it gets such good ratings I (2:30 - 2:36)
I need to be on the top rated Pokemon (2:33 - 2:39)
odd yes of the Internet having i guess i (2:36 - 2:43)
know we we don't you know if greg and i (2:39 - 2:45)
did not already have enough problems (2:43 - 2:48)
with his love of faulty pokemon it's (2:45 - 2:53)
just is just making it worse ok ok I I'm (2:48 - 2:56)
here he is as to like what your metric (2:53 - 2:59)
is for top-rated because certainly this (2:56 - 3:00)
show is more writing than done to the (2:59 - 3:03)
Dragon Knights and I thought I thought (3:00 - 3:05)
in the rankings like on iTunes rankings (3:03 - 3:07)
the dungeons and dragon age was ahead of (3:05 - 3:10)
its super effective oh right i don't (3:07 - 3:12)
know they're in different categories for (3:10 - 3:14)
sure like it's super effective is in the (3:12 - 3:16)
video game category and dungeons and (3:14 - 3:18)
dragon it's is in the other games (3:16 - 3:20)
category with like it's in other games (3:18 - 3:22)
because that's where all the other D&D (3:20 - 3:26)
and board game podcast are with that (3:22 - 3:28)
being said the video game category is (3:26 - 3:31)
much more saturated and much more (3:28 - 3:33)
competitive and there's i guess those (3:31 - 3:36)
are the the two milestones that (3:33 - 3:39)
sometimes puts it's super effective a (3:36 - 3:41)
little far back but the last pretty much (3:39 - 3:44)
for all of 2016 it's super effective has (3:41 - 3:47)
been in the top 50 most downloaded in (3:44 - 3:49)
the video game section if not higher (3:47 - 3:52)
than that and dungeons and dragon its (3:49 - 3:55)
sits in life the top 20 or 30 of the (3:52 - 3:59)
other games section of itunes hmm where (3:55 - 4:03)
is dr check other games dr check would (3:59 - 4:04)
be other games because it is a card game (4:03 - 4:06)
so most card games would be in that and (4:04 - 4:09)
other than other ganz is that way less (4:06 - 4:11)
competitive than like video games and (4:09 - 4:13)
obviously drive check wouldn't fall (4:11 - 4:14)
under video games that's in the top 10 (4:13 - 4:19)
right of other games i don't i am (4:14 - 4:22)
unaware of the stats i mean i could pull (4:19 - 4:24)
them up for you but but i can at least (4:22 - 4:26)
say this where the the number one (4:24 - 4:33)
cardfight vanguard podcast that it still (4:26 - 4:38)
puts out episodes my in all in all (4:33 - 4:40)
fairness I mean you gotta do what you (4:38 - 4:41)
have to do to make yourself feel (4:40 - 4:44)
important though the wikipedia page for (4:41 - 4:47)
my hometown so (4:44 - 4:51)
muskegon michigan is the biggest city on (4:47 - 4:57)
Lake Michigan's East Coast the amount of (4:51 - 4:59)
qualifiers that were needed to make that (4:57 - 5:03)
point where are a lot but I feel like (4:59 - 5:05)
it's that sort of qualifications you (5:03 - 5:07)
need to do to make yourself feel good so (5:05 - 5:10)
whatever whatever you need to do it to (5:07 - 5:13)
really make drive Trek feels important (5:10 - 5:14)
as it is you got you just got to do it (5:13 - 5:17)
and then it that it's kind of funny cuz (5:14 - 5:19)
my hometown in New York they always (5:17 - 5:22)
advertise that their name used to be saw (5:19 - 5:25)
pit because as if that town didn't have (5:22 - 5:26)
enough problems as it is they want to (5:25 - 5:31)
advertise it they used to be a dump no (5:26 - 5:33)
Jack check is awesome where the number (5:31 - 5:35)
one cardfight vanguard podcast that is (5:33 - 5:39)
putting out episodes in 2016 I'm (5:35 - 5:42)
officially call us at the number one (5:39 - 5:47)
action comedy drama musical in America (5:42 - 5:49)
we're also that where we're fighting (5:47 - 5:54)
Hamilton for the beer for that space oh (5:49 - 5:58)
Lord I know we normally don't talk about (5:54 - 6:00)
pokemon for the first couple minutes (5:58 - 6:02)
here but I went to break in the floor (6:00 - 6:05)
mat I went to six flags yesterday great (6:02 - 6:08)
america really yeah town it sat in (6:05 - 6:12)
Gurnee Illinois ooh it is very close to (6:08 - 6:15)
a stake and shake which I enjoy and was (6:12 - 6:18)
the primary reason I agreed to go to six (6:15 - 6:21)
flags because I am and not a amusement (6:18 - 6:24)
park person I mean basically don't like (6:21 - 6:28)
fun things right yes yes a hundred (6:24 - 6:31)
percent but I will say the amount of (6:28 - 6:35)
Pokemon knockoffs of like giant (6:31 - 6:38)
overstuffed Pokemon plushies were very (6:35 - 6:40)
rampant mm-hmm among gonna knock offs I (6:38 - 6:43)
mean it's like it's not the the high (6:40 - 6:47)
quality Pokemon Center washes but if i (6:43 - 6:50)
remember right there just they are (6:47 - 6:52)
pokemon flushes it's not like a knockoff (6:50 - 6:54)
but they're just not very high quality (6:52 - 6:57)
yeah there I mean squirtle look like he (6:54 - 6:59)
was having a bad day hanging up there (6:57 - 7:01)
yeah yeah (6:59 - 7:04)
but it was I mean not that I would have (7:01 - 7:05)
I think it was it was always like five (7:04 - 7:08)
dollars for one play or ten dollars for (7:05 - 7:10)
three plays or something ridiculous like (7:08 - 7:12)
that but i was looking at all the other (7:10 - 7:14)
toys and unless you are like a big fan (7:12 - 7:18)
of generic unicorns or a big fan of just (7:14 - 7:21)
a giant snake the pokemon i'm a big fan (7:18 - 7:24)
of a giant snake let's not get anybody (7:21 - 7:29)
about that give me the anacondas (7:24 - 7:31)
whatever else other kind of snakes you (7:29 - 7:34)
can think of I'm thrilled Oh constrictor (7:31 - 7:38)
yeah rattler now Rattlers a little tiny (7:34 - 7:41)
Viper I think I thought they were like I (7:38 - 7:43)
guess they are smaller than I'm like me (7:41 - 7:48)
a cobra regal yes I guess like why would (7:43 - 7:50)
what I don't know maybe it's because I I (7:48 - 7:53)
like pokemon but like why would you go (7:50 - 7:56)
for you know the the generic teddy bear (7:53 - 7:59)
when you can go for the you know derpy (7:56 - 8:02)
looking Turtwig when I was there the the (7:59 - 8:04)
pokemon plushies were pretty popular (8:02 - 8:07)
prizes I mean that was years ago when I (8:04 - 8:08)
was in high school and we went on a (8:07 - 8:11)
marching band trip but to the same six (8:08 - 8:14)
flags I don't know if it's the same one (8:11 - 8:16)
but I mean what they're what are their (8:14 - 8:18)
likes eight six flags and I guess it's (8:16 - 8:20)
cedar point that we would go to and (8:18 - 8:22)
they'll get you mixed up yeah I think (8:20 - 8:25)
that's no hi oh yeah yeah that's the one (8:22 - 8:27)
thinking of yeah supposedly there's a (8:25 - 8:30)
Six Flags near DC but everybody goes to (8:27 - 8:32)
Paramount's kings dominion so I don't (8:30 - 8:35)
even know where the Six Flags is around (8:32 - 8:37)
here I guess I was more shocked that (8:35 - 8:40)
like there were no like minion prizes or (8:37 - 8:43)
no angry birds prizes or anything like (8:40 - 8:45)
that like as for like of course there's (8:43 - 8:48)
there's your loony toons prizes because (8:45 - 8:51)
I think six flags has some deal with the (8:48 - 8:53)
looney tunes and then there's your (8:51 - 8:57)
Batman spider-man Superman plushies (8:53 - 9:00)
because all the rides are almost all the (8:57 - 9:02)
rides arranged superhero themed Pokemon (9:00 - 9:05)
was like the one weird like here is (9:02 - 9:07)
another franchise that just happens to (9:05 - 9:09)
be prizes but we have no rides or (9:07 - 9:12)
anything else based off it but he hears (9:09 - 9:14)
an obvious franchise that you can win (9:12 - 9:17)
which was confusing but also cool that (9:14 - 9:20)
like is so clearly popular enough as a (9:17 - 9:26)
prize that many booths still had but (9:20 - 9:28)
like in every because six wives broke (9:26 - 9:30)
into sections like here's your western (9:28 - 9:32)
section and here's your future section (9:30 - 9:35)
and here's your kids section like every (9:32 - 9:39)
section had if not one but two booths (9:35 - 9:41)
where you can win pokemon stuff ya know (9:39 - 9:43)
people still have those fond Pokemon (9:41 - 9:46)
memories but it's not but that's the (9:43 - 9:49)
thing is that it's not just it you'd (9:46 - 9:51)
think it would be oh it's just flying (9:49 - 9:54)
off gen1 nostalgia but at least at cedar (9:51 - 9:56)
point when i was there and this again (9:54 - 9:58)
this was years ago i think i got a (9:56 - 10:02)
pimple up so it's not the it's not your (9:58 - 10:05)
entry level stuff well Piplup was (10:02 - 10:08)
somebody's entry level true true yeah (10:05 - 10:11)
there was besides a giant peach you (10:08 - 10:13)
charmander squirtle Bulbasaur there was (10:11 - 10:16)
giant Piplup and jaron turtwig and i (10:13 - 10:20)
think those were the only two none (10:16 - 10:23)
chimchar didn't make a guy bitching same (10:20 - 10:25)
thing only Chimchar made the cut at all (10:23 - 10:28)
no not that I saw at least I was I was I (10:25 - 10:30)
was trying to be observant because I I (10:28 - 10:32)
skipped out on a lot of rides that my (10:30 - 10:35)
mom and Irene went on how did you go (10:32 - 10:37)
with your family I just my mom and Irene (10:35 - 10:39)
and my son no he went alone I well no (10:37 - 10:42)
but I mean like did die his brother go (10:39 - 10:45)
did any of his sisters go we met one of (10:42 - 10:48)
my sisters and her friend down there and (10:45 - 10:52)
was that unloads know like her friend (10:48 - 10:56)
there's no quote stated and we went and (10:52 - 10:58)
we went on like a ride-or- to it them (10:56 - 10:59)
and just hung out and then they they (10:58 - 11:01)
left early because they had other plans (10:59 - 11:02)
that's why they got there so early (11:01 - 11:06)
uh-huh but yeah my mom really wanted to (11:02 - 11:07)
go and then I readin wanted to go and (11:06 - 11:08)
the night room was like I really want (11:07 - 11:12)
you to go and I was like like this stuff (11:08 - 11:16)
but I went just an exacerbation sigh (11:12 - 11:20)
it's basically I'm sorry Steve you're a (11:16 - 11:22)
lot of fun to hang out with alright (11:20 - 11:24)
that's fair that's fair what about what (11:22 - 11:26)
about you Travis what was on your plate (11:24 - 11:28)
this past weekend I ain't (11:26 - 11:30)
bring things full circle but we were (11:28 - 11:32)
just talking about dungeons and dragon (11:30 - 11:35)
i'ts and I actually played D&D within (11:32 - 11:37)
the just the campaign I'm running with (11:35 - 11:39)
my friends so I played DMD again on (11:37 - 11:41)
friday and i'm going to play D&D again (11:39 - 11:46)
tomorrow so my life has been pretty d20 (11:41 - 11:49)
centric but um but you're down with that (11:46 - 11:51)
though that's like yeah I love Danny (11:49 - 11:54)
like your destiny of tabletop Dungeons (11:51 - 11:57)
and Dragons it's like destiny but (11:54 - 12:01)
actually fun do they still make the the (11:57 - 12:03)
Marvel Comics role-playing game that was (12:01 - 12:04)
like D&D except you could be like (12:03 - 12:06)
mutants and stuff I don't know about (12:04 - 12:10)
that one in particular but I mean there (12:06 - 12:12)
are plenty of superhero games and I (12:10 - 12:13)
wouldn't be surprised if some of them (12:12 - 12:16)
are Marvel but I don't specifically know (12:13 - 12:17)
any information about that one I've (12:16 - 12:20)
never played any of the superhero RPGs (12:17 - 12:24)
uh it doesn't really interest me that (12:20 - 12:27)
much I'm not really an expert there see (12:24 - 12:29)
cuz for the next season instead of doing (12:27 - 12:31)
dungeons and dragon i'ts you could do a (12:29 - 12:33)
superhero role playing game with Pokemon (12:31 - 12:35)
in there what do we but yeah but what do (12:33 - 12:37)
we call it though it has to be a pun (12:35 - 12:40)
can't you can't do it Pokemon superhero (12:37 - 12:46)
game nice one it rolls right off the (12:40 - 12:49)
tongue there at Travis have you played a (12:46 - 12:53)
D&D game that has just gone haribol yeah (12:49 - 12:57)
I mean what was that I'm just asking cuz (12:53 - 12:59)
you're you're you're up to like three a (12:57 - 13:01)
week now so clearly you you enjoy it a (12:59 - 13:03)
lot it's something that seems yea high (13:01 - 13:06)
priority of fun for you but then at (13:03 - 13:08)
least with me and board games there (13:06 - 13:09)
sometimes where you play a board game (13:08 - 13:11)
and like the experience is just so sour (13:09 - 13:14)
that you're like I don't want to I think (13:11 - 13:15)
I'm gonna let that board game set in the (13:14 - 13:17)
shelf well then in that I've never had (13:15 - 13:19)
I've had individual sessions of (13:17 - 13:21)
campaigns that as a whole have gone well (13:19 - 13:23)
where I'm like I wasn't a lot of fun (13:21 - 13:27)
like I've had instances with a when I (13:23 - 13:29)
was in college I went in that group I (13:27 - 13:34)
played in therapy sessions where people (13:29 - 13:36)
would be mad at each other just because (13:34 - 13:41)
of general college drama things college (13:36 - 13:41)
friend (13:41 - 13:43)
the things and then would try to steal (13:41 - 13:47)
from each other or whatever in in game (13:43 - 13:49)
and that was just sort of a bad scene (13:47 - 13:51)
but it would never really lasts so long (13:49 - 13:53)
that it would feel like the game was the (13:51 - 13:55)
problem more than the people so we would (13:53 - 13:59)
get back together next week and whatever (13:55 - 14:01)
it was that was bothering people in real (13:59 - 14:03)
life would have gone away and so the (14:01 - 14:04)
next session would have been fine so now (14:03 - 14:06)
I've never had like a full campaign go (14:04 - 14:11)
super south mostly because i only play (14:06 - 14:13)
with my friends i'm sure if i went to (14:11 - 14:17)
one of those places where you go to like (14:13 - 14:20)
a trading card store and they have like (14:17 - 14:22)
a dnd night and i'm playing with (14:20 - 14:24)
strangers that that could go pretty bad (14:22 - 14:26)
but I've not going to imagine that (14:24 - 14:30)
conversation well my DM makes us do role (14:26 - 14:31)
for intelligence before we have to do a (14:30 - 14:33)
roll for initiative just to see if we (14:31 - 14:34)
had better sensations so I don't (14:33 - 14:36)
understand why we're playing this way um (14:34 - 14:40)
I earned this magical item that gets me (14:36 - 14:42)
a natural 20 on every role I do I mean (14:40 - 14:44)
just because you weren't there for that (14:42 - 14:46)
campaign doesn't mean you get to say (14:44 - 14:48)
what my character does and doesn't have (14:46 - 14:52)
thank you I earned this please I mean I (14:48 - 14:54)
mess up I get confused easily are we (14:52 - 14:56)

dining meet you for Korea South Korea to (21:52 - 21:58)
be specific new Pokemon go details and (21:54 - 22:01)
images emerge this is from comic book (21:58 - 22:05)
com we're only pulling the best websites (22:01 - 22:08)
here for news I mean we could go worse (22:05 - 22:10)
Travis and I were talking about much (22:08 - 22:14)
worse oh we could go worse we should we (22:10 - 22:16)
should pull up that article in a little (22:14 - 22:19)
bit just to uh to really dive deep into (22:16 - 22:22)
the rumor mill now but most of the stuff (22:19 - 22:25)
comes from a subreddit that is dedicated (22:22 - 22:27)
to Pokemon go take it with a grain of (22:25 - 22:29)
salt here but we do know that there are (22:27 - 22:32)
beta testers in Japan already so most of (22:29 - 22:35)
this probably has some weight as beta (22:32 - 22:37)
test continues on Pokemon go the (22:35 - 22:38)
augmented reality mobile game that (22:37 - 22:40)
allows you to capture metal Pokemon in (22:38 - 22:42)
the real world more details about the (22:40 - 22:44)
game are continuing to emerge recent (22:42 - 22:47)
beta testers confirm to the subreddit (22:44 - 22:50)
dedicated Pokemon go that biomes were (22:47 - 22:53)
now active meaning a certain type of (22:50 - 22:54)
Pokemon would only appear in certain (22:53 - 22:57)
type of terrain and conditions for (22:54 - 22:59)
example a water type of motor Phil found (22:57 - 23:01)
near a river while normal type pokemon (22:59 - 23:04)
like ratata we're seen in dense urban (23:01 - 23:07)
centers it has also recently confirmed (23:04 - 23:08)
that trainers can only evolve their (23:07 - 23:11)
Pokemon via evolution chards the (23:08 - 23:13)
trainer's collect the shards by (23:11 - 23:15)
capturing pokemon evolution shards are (23:13 - 23:17)
Pokemon specific which means you need to (23:15 - 23:19)
capture multiple Pokemon of the same (23:17 - 23:21)
species to collect it off shards once 20 (23:19 - 23:23)
shards are collected trainers can select (23:21 - 23:25)
one Pokemon of that species to evolve (23:23 - 23:28)
Pokemon that involve twice like (23:25 - 23:30)
Bulbasaur trainers will need to evolve (23:28 - 23:33)
pen Pokemon to the first stage to evolve (23:30 - 23:36)
the Pokemon to the second stage some new (23:33 - 23:38)
screen chat screen caps from the game (23:36 - 23:39)
also emerged showing poke (23:38 - 23:42)
one goes pokédex and battle sequence you (23:39 - 23:43)
can check out the full gallery below (23:42 - 23:46)
blah blah blah blah blah blah so really (23:43 - 23:48)
the the takeaway here and why I pulled (23:46 - 23:50)
this article is because of the battle (23:48 - 23:52)
shard information and I wanted to know (23:50 - 23:55)
what your guys's thoughts on that work I (23:52 - 23:56)
find it interesting that although they (23:55 - 23:59)
have a battle system that is not the way (23:56 - 24:02)
in which you've all Pokemon I find that (23:59 - 24:04)
to be strange i realize that the system (24:02 - 24:06)
they're using might be better suited for (24:04 - 24:08)
that type of game but it just seems a (24:06 - 24:12)
little odd to be using so many of the (24:08 - 24:14)
conventions of the property but not that (24:12 - 24:16)
one well I'm happy that there is (24:14 - 24:19)
evolving in any form as part of the game (24:16 - 24:20)
because i really hope pokemon games (24:19 - 24:23)
where there's no no evolving well by (24:20 - 24:26)
shadow and i really hate Pokemon gay (24:23 - 24:29)
dude I what I play three pokemon games (24:26 - 24:30)
every single day that don't have (24:29 - 24:33)
evolving so my hate is a very gentle (24:30 - 24:36)
hatred but still I would prefer for the (24:33 - 24:40)
head and evolution mechanic versus just (24:36 - 24:43)
having different levels the debut album (24:40 - 24:45)
by Will Anderson my hate is a gentle (24:43 - 24:50)
hatred I don't know the exact reason why (24:45 - 24:53)
there would be a shard system instead of (24:50 - 24:56)
a battle system besides minute maybe the (24:53 - 24:57)
obvious reason of they don't want the (24:56 - 25:00)
two games to be so similar to that two (24:57 - 25:03)
games meaning the pokémon go and poke my (25:00 - 25:08)
main series game uh but you see the (25:03 - 25:10)
collecting of the same thing a lot to (25:08 - 25:13)
upgrade something fairly common in (25:10 - 25:16)
mobile games yeah because then you can (25:13 - 25:20)
say if you want to evolve your evolved (25:16 - 25:23)
into Blastoise faster will sell you five (25:20 - 25:29)
cards for a dollar right out mmm then (25:23 - 25:31)
you can accelerate the process by one (25:29 - 25:37)
shard one USD but yeah the I can't wait (25:31 - 25:42)
for Pokemon global Offensive I just (25:37 - 25:43)
realized that that's a joke you can make (25:42 - 25:48)
and fraud it I was gonna say that in in (25:43 - 25:51)
clash Royale oh god you have to collect (25:48 - 25:53)
X amount of a card too (25:51 - 25:57)
upgrade your current card and you could (25:53 - 25:59)
you know by a chest which gives you a (25:57 - 26:02)
bunch of cards which you hope that is (25:59 - 26:04)
the car do you want so you can spend the (26:02 - 26:08)
gold I mean to me besides this being in (26:04 - 26:11)
a lot of mobile game mobile games on the (26:08 - 26:13)
market and it's very popular and it's (26:11 - 26:15)
very easy for people to understand that (26:13 - 26:19)
it's also very easy to what you guys (26:15 - 26:23)
said hide and control microtransactions (26:19 - 26:26)
as in maybe not so much getting shards (26:23 - 26:29)
but getting maybe more pokeballs to (26:26 - 26:32)
catch so if you have a limit of maybe (26:29 - 26:35)
five pokeballs a day and I don't know if (26:32 - 26:38)
this is true not just me talking give a (26:35 - 26:39)
limit of five poke balls a day and you (26:38 - 26:42)
need ten twirls to evolve your squirtle (26:39 - 26:44)
that's going to take you two days powers (26:42 - 26:49)
combined that's gonna are Wartortle (26:44 - 26:52)
that's going to take you two days but if (26:49 - 26:56)
you buy you know 20 pokeballs for 99 (26:52 - 26:58)
cents well you've accelerated that (26:56 - 27:01)
process in a way and you've spent money (26:58 - 27:03)
whereas if you could just battle and (27:01 - 27:05)
that was something normal you could do (27:03 - 27:06)
you could just grind that out in this (27:05 - 27:08)
way you can't grind it out because (27:06 - 27:09)
you're limited by the resources you have (27:08 - 27:12)
if they put a cap on battles that would (27:09 - 27:14)
be very weird whereas if they're poor (27:12 - 27:16)
they're just putting a cap on how many (27:14 - 27:19)
free pokeballs you get that makes more (27:16 - 27:23)
sense at least in gameplay aspect and an (27:19 - 27:25)
a let's make money aspect I mean I'm not (27:23 - 27:28)
gonna disagree yeah really only way to (27:25 - 27:30)
know is wait and see sounds like like (27:28 - 27:31)
Travis's like far away from his mic (27:30 - 27:34)
making a sandwich guy that sounds (27:31 - 27:38)
right to me like butter in some bread I (27:34 - 27:43)
think better yeah thanks Tom yo ma last (27:38 - 27:45)
bit of news here is the pokemon TV app (27:43 - 27:49)
has been updated with the x y&z anime (27:45 - 27:51)
enough well had anything to come it (27:49 - 27:53)
right away but I probably did I was like (27:51 - 27:55)
had a huge yawn coming out of me so I (27:53 - 27:57)
was on mute um was it sure if you were (27:55 - 27:59)
still laughing at my peanut butter joke (27:57 - 28:00)
here let me just run down the bullet (27:59 - 28:03)
points before we get you to censor my (28:00 - 28:06)
channel okay the app updates includes my (28:03 - 28:06)
channel where face (28:06 - 28:08)
and start watching a video it has (28:06 - 28:10)
automatically saved to their channel (28:08 - 28:12)
making it easy to resume later (28:10 - 28:14)

network can still access and enjoy their (28:14 - 28:17)
favorite Pokemon content with the (28:16 - 28:20)
updated app viewers can mark one episode (28:17 - 28:22)
or movie for offline viewing convenience (28:20 - 28:24)
the video will be stored on their device (28:22 - 28:26)
for one week before it's automatically (28:24 - 28:27)
removed that's actually really really (28:26 - 28:30)
cool if you're going on the plane you (28:27 - 28:32)
could download a movie Pokemon movie and (28:30 - 28:35)
then watch it and then be disappointed (28:32 - 28:37)
other two features are rape videos with (28:35 - 28:40)
this fun feature Pokemon fans can rate (28:37 - 28:42)
each video after they finish watching it (28:40 - 28:43)
their stores contribute on an average (28:42 - 28:46)
rating for the video and be curious to (28:43 - 28:48)
see what what is actually like to not (28:46 - 28:50)
liked and then push notifications (28:48 - 28:52)
because we all love that viewers can now (28:50 - 28:53)
find out when new movies and episodes (28:52 - 28:55)
have been added to the pokémon TV app (28:53 - 28:58)
with convenient push notifications and (28:55 - 29:01)
then the pokémon series XYZ the newest (28:58 - 29:03)
season of the Pokemon anime animation (29:01 - 29:05)
they be even in February new episodes (29:03 - 29:07)
can be viewed all year long and the (29:05 - 29:08)
Pokemon TV app shortly after they are (29:07 - 29:11)
aired every Saturday morning on Cartoon (29:08 - 29:14)
Network pokemon podcast not sponsored by (29:11 - 29:17)
Cartoon Network yes um that's uh that's (29:14 - 29:20)
pretty sick because that means that (29:17 - 29:22)
they're moving out of the hulu and (29:20 - 29:27)
netflix markets and kind of becoming (29:22 - 29:29)
their own now I hope they don't start (29:27 - 29:33)
making the appt paid for um I mean we (29:29 - 29:34)
said I said this earlier on a podcast (29:33 - 29:36)
before I've I would have no problem (29:34 - 29:39)
paying pokemon for ninety-nine a month (29:36 - 29:42)
for all the movies and all the TV shows (29:39 - 29:47)
i would go to dollars and 73 cents (29:42 - 29:50)
that's specific well i'm a very exacting (29:47 - 29:53)
science economics is is real man that's (29:50 - 29:55)
where my supply meet demand right there (29:53 - 29:57)
two dollars and seventy three cents but (29:55 - 30:00)
ill oh I go a buck a month considering (29:57 - 30:02)
the fact that they're willing to go it's (30:00 - 30:04)
like five dollars a year for pokemon (30:02 - 30:06)
bank like if they're already setting the (30:04 - 30:10)
bar there I don't see why the the show (30:06 - 30:13)
would be two different of a price well (30:10 - 30:15)
because its actual dynamic content (30:13 - 30:18)
that's made by lots of people over many (30:15 - 30:20)
years in time with (30:18 - 30:23)
video games aren't the video guess you (30:20 - 30:28)
don't have five dollars a year no I've (30:23 - 30:30)
had a couple of people ask me like now (30:28 - 30:33)
that XYZ is on the Pokemon app should (30:30 - 30:35)
they like where should they start in (30:33 - 30:37)
watching the cartoon and I'm like you (30:35 - 30:39)
can you can start from the first XY (30:37 - 30:42)
season and it's worth it and I've (30:39 - 30:43)
actually also had a couple of people's (30:42 - 30:45)
like after I've told them that they're (30:43 - 30:47)
like oh my god this is so incredible and (30:45 - 30:49)
so different than the old pokemon (30:47 - 30:52)
cartoons that it's like it really is (30:49 - 30:56)
worth watching XYZ is a resource though (30:52 - 30:59)
right we'll like now it's like it's a (30:56 - 31:01)
canal you agent it's a continuation from (30:59 - 31:04)
x and y okay well just start off with (31:01 - 31:08)
that season and be all right no because (31:04 - 31:11)
it's a merge of x and y and the mega (31:08 - 31:13)
evolution specials so I actually (31:11 - 31:15)
recommend that people watch both so that (31:13 - 31:18)
you're really ready for like the parts (31:15 - 31:19)
that are going to come in from the mega (31:18 - 31:21)
evolution specials and the parts that (31:19 - 31:24)
come in from x and y is the mega at (31:21 - 31:27)
sorry I obviously didn't check the (31:24 - 31:28)
question just came to mind but is the (31:27 - 31:30)
mega evolution special something that (31:28 - 31:33)
you can see on the Pokemon TV app where (31:30 - 31:36)
does that exist I don't internet in the (31:33 - 31:39)
hearts and minds of the fans of pokemon (31:36 - 31:42)

community of ship and to beach after was (32:19 - 32:25)
going what it would even in this in this (32:23 - 32:27)
hypothetical with whom are you shipping (32:25 - 32:29)
Gary because because the term Gary (32:27 - 32:31)
shipping would just imply like I mean (32:29 - 32:34)
hoping Gary gets in (32:31 - 32:39)
a relationship I mean I'd ship Gary with (32:34 - 32:43)
the world friendzone shipping so the (32:39 - 32:45)

a five star review in itunes reading (37:14 - 37:22)
gosh this show is just so great ah (37:17 - 37:25)
alright we we need to take a break and (37:22 - 37:28)
reset expectations of all the people (37:25 - 37:31)
that are extremely mad that we've ruined (37:28 - 37:38)
their Alexa experience head back (37:31 - 37:38)
and we are back from our break there was (38:06 - 38:13)
a recent movie night and was it friday (38:10 - 38:16)
yeah it was friday it was friday it was (38:13 - 38:19)
the right and a movie night have you (38:16 - 38:21)
felt it has been an awakening oh we (38:19 - 38:25)
ended up watching da cry the rise of (38:21 - 38:26)
darkrai believe the movie is actually (38:25 - 38:31)
called mm-hmm and I'm gonna give you the (38:26 - 38:35)
22nd recap here that movie has a lot of (38:31 - 38:39)
fantastic moments a lot of funny things (38:35 - 38:42)
happen a lot of memorable things happen (38:39 - 38:45)
but after the hour and 20 minutes I (38:42 - 38:49)
don't know what I watched I don't know (38:45 - 38:53)
what really happened and part of that (38:49 - 38:56)
was because my attention was not fully (38:53 - 38:58)
devoted to the movie as we were having (38:56 - 39:01)
technically she dare you we were having (38:58 - 39:03)
technical issues with rabbit the service (39:01 - 39:05)
we used and I have to give a shout out (39:03 - 39:09)
to the support team at rabbit as they (39:05 - 39:11)
made sure that even though that the (39:09 - 39:14)
technical issues existed that the movie (39:11 - 39:16)
and the chat remained going the entire (39:14 - 39:19)
time I enjoy your phrasing of that while (39:16 - 39:20)
the technical team made sure that the (39:19 - 39:23)
problems existed and continued to (39:20 - 39:25)
disrupt our viewing so one of the (39:23 - 39:27)
problems so rooms were supposed to cap (39:25 - 39:30)
at 25 our room captain capped at 16 for (39:27 - 39:31)
some odd reason so we couldn't get more (39:30 - 39:34)
people in which was a bummer at one (39:31 - 39:37)
point the chat broke on my computer (39:34 - 39:39)
because I tried to leave and restart the (39:37 - 39:41)
room without interrupting the movie and (39:39 - 39:43)
that was the tone it's ours though (39:41 - 39:45)
another problem but I don't really (39:43 - 39:49)
understand so spoiler if you haven't (39:45 - 39:52)
seen the movie just like in Arceus and (39:49 - 39:55)
the jewel of life they pitch Arceus as a (39:52 - 39:57)
bad guy but in reality he's a good guy (39:55 - 39:59)
the same could be said about darkrai (39:57 - 40:01)
they pitch him as a bad guy at the end (39:59 - 40:04)
you know ash cries because he thinks (40:01 - 40:06)
darkrai is dead and no dark right is duh (40:04 - 40:09)
cries still alive so you know they're (40:06 - 40:10)
very happy obviously darker I was not (40:09 - 40:14)
the bad guy but Palkia and daya are (40:10 - 40:19)
fighting for some reason and they the (40:14 - 40:20)
heroes are quite (40:19 - 40:23)
I mean a tower at the end and if they (40:20 - 40:24)
don't do something at the top of the (40:23 - 40:27)
tower the world explodes worse or gets (40:24 - 40:30)
destroyed and at some point they rot out (40:27 - 40:32)
of time and Bracco's they didn't make it (40:30 - 40:38)
oh what a minute later it's okay because (40:32 - 40:40)
Pikachu did some electric thing and (40:38 - 40:43)
charged the tower and that was fine but (40:40 - 40:46)
backing on that as everyone's climbing (40:43 - 40:49)
the tower i asked chat I said who is the (40:46 - 40:54)
actual bad guy and I got the tower I got (40:49 - 40:58)
the environment I got all these answers (40:54 - 41:01)
but I didn't get Darkrai and I didn't (40:58 - 41:03)
get any Pokemon I just got everything (41:01 - 41:07)
but those three pokemon so I don't know (41:03 - 41:10)
who the bad guy actually was I can tell (41:07 - 41:11)
you I know who the bad guy is in that (41:10 - 41:13)
movie the guy who switches places with (41:11 - 41:17)
his licky tongue yeah the Baron or licky (41:13 - 41:19)
licky whatever it's a lucky I don't you (41:17 - 41:21)
yeah it's just a bad scene generally (41:19 - 41:23)
isn't it a shiny like a lucky too I (41:21 - 41:25)
don't remember but actually I don't (41:23 - 41:27)
think that is that now that you're (41:25 - 41:28)
saying that he doesn't switch places (41:27 - 41:31)
with licky licky he just turns into a (41:28 - 41:33)
licky licky and his licky licky is just (41:31 - 41:35)
like laying there dead the entire time (41:33 - 41:40)
what yeah cuz I oh I mean I I think at (41:35 - 41:42)
one point the licky licky comes comes (41:40 - 41:45)
back because he doesn't stay licky licky (41:42 - 41:47)
very long which again was another (41:45 - 41:50)
misconception I had cuz I thought he (41:47 - 41:51)
switched places with Luke really key but (41:50 - 41:54)
he just turns into a licky licky and I (41:51 - 41:55)
thought it lasted a lot longer than it (41:54 - 41:58)
didn't it didn't but to compare the (41:55 - 42:01)
movie to Arceus in the dual life Arceus (41:58 - 42:04)
in the dual life is just a better movie (42:01 - 42:06)
the story makes sense the story is good (42:04 - 42:08)
i think the twist is actually pretty (42:06 - 42:12)
clever and Arceus and the dual life (42:08 - 42:15)
doesn't really focus on Ash and the (42:12 - 42:17)
other companions it mostly focuses on (42:15 - 42:19)
the story of Arceus I would have to say (42:17 - 42:22)
that's probably currently the best (42:19 - 42:25)
Pokemon movie I have seen to date darle (42:22 - 42:27)
cry the rise of me if you watch the (42:25 - 42:30)
direct the extended director's final cut (42:27 - 42:33)
that's Ridley Scott's real mission (42:30 - 42:35)
no you have to watch the shame in movie (42:33 - 42:37)
because I think that clears everything (42:35 - 42:41)
up kind of like um how the godfather (42:37 - 42:44)
part two you know made everything about (42:41 - 42:46)
Godfather Part one so much clearer and (42:44 - 42:49)
the the shaming Giratina movie just (42:46 - 42:50)
cleared everything up because really (42:49 - 42:52)
what it is it's just like destruction of (42:50 - 42:54)
the environment and dialga palkia and (42:52 - 42:56)
Giratina are all supposed to work (42:54 - 42:58)
together to keep balance in the universe (42:56 - 43:01)
by you in the netherworld or whatever (42:58 - 43:04)
garrett inas negative lambda sculpt zone (43:01 - 43:07)
or the isn't the negative zone I think (43:04 - 43:10)
so no that's a thing from Marvel the but (43:07 - 43:13)
there's something dimension that shoot (43:10 - 43:15)
what is it called Alexa where does (43:13 - 43:19)
garrett ena live oh I still don't have (43:15 - 43:21)
an Alexa but anyways it's like in the (43:19 - 43:23)
shame in movie you see that like when (43:21 - 43:25)
there's disruptions in our store Shin (43:23 - 43:28)
world yep that the it sends like (43:25 - 43:31)
pollution into gear tina's world and (43:28 - 43:33)
then Giratina has to clean that up and (43:31 - 43:35)
then it's kind of like the battle (43:33 - 43:37)
between de algun and Palkia is causing (43:35 - 43:39)
more disruptions and it's quite this is (43:37 - 43:41)
potential that the two worlds can (43:39 - 43:44)
unravel both of them so you know this is (43:41 - 43:46)
very important so the stakes are high (43:44 - 43:50)
yes justice was served so I was (43:46 - 43:52)
delicious I want to thank everyone who (43:50 - 43:54)
came out to movie night I think everyone (43:52 - 43:57)
had a really good time so much that they (43:54 - 43:59)
demanded another movie and I didn't want (43:57 - 44:01)
to didn't want to bite off more than I (43:59 - 44:03)
can chew especially since we only have (44:01 - 44:07)
19 pokemon movies to choose from so we (44:03 - 44:10)
ended up watching pokemon organs just to (44:07 - 44:11)
cap off the night and it was very very (44:10 - 44:14)
enjoyable so i will post the next movie (44:11 - 44:17)
nick coming up we'll probably do the (44:14 - 44:18)
giratina movie just to finish off that (44:17 - 44:21)
series and then if we do end up (44:18 - 44:23)
finishing on the movies of movie night (44:21 - 44:26)
continues being a set success will (44:23 - 44:30)
probably go back through and and start (44:26 - 44:32)
watching them again for those obviously (44:30 - 44:34)
who couldn't make it to the first (44:32 - 44:36)
viewings you heard it here first Arceus (44:34 - 44:38)
in the jewel life my number one Pokemon (44:36 - 44:41)
movie right now we have to do the shame (44:38 - 44:43)
in one next cuz that's the one well so (44:41 - 44:46)
this is good I had to be there this time (44:43 - 44:48)
it's no good but it may be explained I (44:46 - 44:50)
mean shame is a terrible Pokemon little (44:48 - 44:54)
diamond no shaven just like well maybe (44:50 - 44:56)
after you watch the movie you won't like (44:54 - 44:59)
it so much um so why is that the best (44:56 - 45:02)
one to watch dark cry has a real good (44:59 - 45:05)
voice it explains everything I didn't (45:02 - 45:07)
say it's a good movie it's just (45:05 - 45:10)
exposition real quick will what's your (45:07 - 45:13)
favorite Pokemon movie oh the Celebi one (45:10 - 45:15)
oh my I can't trust your judgment the (45:13 - 45:20)
movies haha Travis Lutter fair Pokemon (45:15 - 45:24)
movie um Oh No Zoroark come on you know (45:20 - 45:26)
zoroark is my favorite Pokemon movie all (45:24 - 45:28)
right I have not seen that one so well I (45:26 - 45:30)
know my least favorite one is the (45:28 - 45:32)
lucario one but I can't tell you what my (45:30 - 45:34)
favorite one is I can't really pin down (45:32 - 45:36)
bukhari one's pretty like when entei was (45:34 - 45:39)
a dad that one time that was weird (45:36 - 45:43)
that's the third movie epic it is spoke (45:39 - 45:46)
amman uh then maybe 2,000 right isn't (45:43 - 45:48)
that or is that the second one no that's (45:46 - 45:49)
the second load I think it's called (45:48 - 45:53)
Pokemon three the movie yes it's a real (45:49 - 45:57)
good title there uh that's the last (45:53 - 46:01)
access of you knows right ah there's no (45:57 - 46:03)
way Pokemon heroes was in theaters the (46:01 - 46:06)
Celebi movie might be the last one (46:03 - 46:08)
theaters but it might have been a little (46:06 - 46:12)
bit out now I saw Victini and Reshiram (46:08 - 46:14)
in the theater yeah yeah it's true that (46:12 - 46:16)
was a one-off but that was also like (46:14 - 46:18)
limited like all in all of Wisconsin it (46:16 - 46:21)
was only one theater for her I'm for (46:18 - 46:24)
worldwide like or United States wide I (46:21 - 46:27)
think the entire movie was the last one (46:24 - 46:30)
we're like every theater I remember (46:27 - 46:32)
riding my bike to the theater when I was (46:30 - 46:35)
like 11 or 12 watching that movie (46:32 - 46:40)

when I say there's a lot coming and (46:48 - 46:51)
don't think that's negative i like I (46:50 - 46:54)
truly like enjoy and love reading your (46:51 - 46:56)
guys's emails and then make me really (46:54 - 46:58)
happy to read them on the show so if you (46:56 - 46:59)
want to email you (46:58 - 47:02)
go to Pokemon podcast calm and hit the (46:59 - 47:04)
contact button fill out the form there (47:02 - 47:08)
or you can just email me directly SBJ at (47:04 - 47:13)
pkmn cast calm both ways gets emails to (47:08 - 47:18)
me first email here is from michael v he (47:13 - 47:20)
writes in saying for Pokemon Sun and (47:18 - 47:22)
Moon should i buy a regular 3ds or a new (47:20 - 47:25)
3ds because i sold my 3ds and now i need (47:22 - 47:28)
one for pokemon sun or moon thanks for (47:25 - 47:31)
your opinion keep up the good work well (47:28 - 47:33)
a new 3ds is not going to be required (47:31 - 47:36)
but monster hunter generations is coming (47:33 - 47:39)
out is that required for the new 3ds uh (47:36 - 47:44)
so either maybe not but I mean it helped (47:39 - 47:46)
with monster hunter on its own I'm sure (47:44 - 47:47)
it will help with monster hunter (47:46 - 47:52)
generations I have never bought any of (47:47 - 47:56)
those little upgrade systems ever and (47:52 - 47:59)
it's always been fine for me yeah if (47:56 - 48:02)
anyone was going to use the extra (47:59 - 48:05)
features of the new 3ds it would be a (48:02 - 48:08)
Pokemon game no doubt because they were (48:05 - 48:12)
the few games that use the dsi features (48:08 - 48:14)
but obviously they used the Game Boy (48:12 - 48:18)
Color features back when the gameboy (48:14 - 48:21)
color was the minor upgrade even though (48:18 - 48:24)
at the time that was such a big deal I i (48:21 - 48:27)
think if if if you can budget it then (48:24 - 48:30)
your night you're not wasting money (48:27 - 48:32)
buying the new 3ds but if you're on a (48:30 - 48:35)
budget you're really trying to save (48:32 - 48:38)
money the normal 3ds will be fine yes (48:35 - 48:41)
and pokemon is never like a like a new (48:38 - 48:44)
system now or a new platform seller like (48:41 - 48:47)
there they are always they hold out on (48:44 - 48:49)
the previous platform all the way to the (48:47 - 48:51)
bitter end but they do things like with (48:49 - 48:53)
black and white too there were add-ons (48:51 - 48:56)
that worked with the 3ds that were not (48:53 - 48:59)
required to play the game it's just you (48:56 - 49:01)
could get like special pokemon and (48:59 - 49:02)
legendary pokemon and stuff if you did (49:01 - 49:04)
it that could transfer into your game so (49:02 - 49:07)
that kind of took advantage of the 3ds (49:04 - 49:09)
features but breed es was not required (49:07 - 49:12)
for black and white to you know x and y (49:09 - 49:13)
was the first game (49:12 - 49:16)
that required the 3ds which was three (49:13 - 49:20)
years after the 3ds and come out already (49:16 - 49:22)
get pokemon always holds on to the (49:20 - 49:25)
previous generation hardware until the (49:22 - 49:28)
very very last that it can Carter s (49:25 - 49:31)
rights in hey spj will Travis and the (49:28 - 49:34)

you guys the whole time and I have never (49:51 - 49:53)
bothered listening to another single (49:52 - 49:56)
pokemon podcast on iTunes I discovered (49:53 - 49:58)
you guys on itune (49:56 - 50:01)
brand loyal brands here I first (49:58 - 50:02)
discovered you guys out not on itunes (50:01 - 50:04)
but on amazon actually i was one of the (50:02 - 50:05)
few people that subscribed to the dollar (50:04 - 50:08)
a month kindle feed of your website's (50:05 - 50:09)
news from there I learned about the (50:08 - 50:11)
podcast and I've been hooked ever since (50:09 - 50:13)
you guys make me laugh numerous times (50:11 - 50:16)
and Travis is my favorite co-host whoo (50:13 - 50:21)
funny slay a funny story I'm not really (50:16 - 50:23)
on social media so I've never seen a (50:21 - 50:25)
picture of any of the host face besides (50:23 - 50:28)
Steve's I will my social my my Twitter (50:25 - 50:30)
picture is just a weird bird house (50:28 - 50:31)
anyway so you're not really missing it (50:30 - 50:34)
there so I'm not gonna closed I have (50:31 - 50:36)
been building up a mental image of (50:34 - 50:39)
Travis in my head until the episode (50:36 - 50:42)
where your time sorry to disappoint in (50:39 - 50:44)
the in the episode where you talked (50:42 - 50:46)
about 3d movies Travis said that he wore (50:44 - 50:50)
glasses I was stunned for real anyways (50:46 - 50:52)
keep up the great work I can't wait to (50:50 - 50:55)
hear your next episode Carter from Ohio (50:52 - 50:59)
p.s SBJ my first shiny was a gold duck (50:55 - 51:02)
mm-hmm so I think one of the most (50:59 - 51:04)
confusing things for me about Travis's (51:02 - 51:08)
appearance is um when I first met him he (51:04 - 51:12)
had short hair and now he just has like (51:08 - 51:16)
tremendous copious amounts of lengthy (51:12 - 51:19)
hair progress is about her Tropius (51:16 - 51:22)
amounts of lengthy hair like just like (51:19 - 51:26)
he's gone full hippie ya have it feels (51:22 - 51:33)
good I would I could I can relate to (51:26 - 51:35)
this email a lot and Thank You Carter (51:33 - 51:37)
for writing in but when I listen I (51:35 - 51:39)
listen to quite a bit of podcast and I (51:37 - 51:44)
always tried to form I'm an image of the (51:39 - 51:47)
said voices I hear and then when I do (51:44 - 51:50)
finally like reach out and discover what (51:47 - 51:52)
they look like it's always disappointing (51:50 - 51:56)
no I know I had that I had that happen (51:52 - 51:58)
with Jesse thorn I like had this image (51:56 - 52:00)
in my head that he was like super (51:58 - 52:02)
sartorial and well quaffed and (52:00 - 52:04)
everything and then you see a picture of (52:02 - 52:06)
him and he looks like somebody who's (52:04 - 52:08)
gonna punch you outside of a biker bar I (52:06 - 52:09)
guess (52:08 - 52:11)
always goes nothing with his appearance (52:09 - 52:14)
I think Josie Thorne is as a handsome (52:11 - 52:15)
gentleman albeit different than you (52:14 - 52:18)
would expect him to be just hearing his (52:15 - 52:24)
voice and some but different I I i would (52:18 - 52:27)
say sometimes the appearance is not what (52:24 - 52:31)
I expect but for the most time it it (52:27 - 52:32)
holds up and it kind of gives you a (52:31 - 52:35)
better I don't know connection to the (52:32 - 52:37)
host that urn that you know what they (52:35 - 52:40)
look like and and usually if I go out (52:37 - 52:44)
and I I look see what they look like I (52:40 - 52:48)
probably like the show quite a bit to (52:44 - 52:50)
figure that out whereas if there's there (52:48 - 52:52)
some podcasts where I don't ever go to (52:50 - 52:54)
their website I don't ever follow their (52:52 - 52:56)
Twitter I don't ever review them like I (52:54 - 52:58)
just listened and then you know can hope (52:56 - 53:00)
for the best and but there are a couple (52:58 - 53:03)
podcast where like I follow everyone on (53:00 - 53:04)
the podcast on Twitter I follow the (53:03 - 53:05)
podcast I like their facebook i go to (53:04 - 53:07)
the right like and everyone listening is (53:05 - 53:09)
like well I don't do that at all for (53:07 - 53:11)
it's super effective so I guess the (53:09 - 53:14)
question we have to ask is Alexa who are (53:11 - 53:18)
America's most handsome podcasters Alexa (53:14 - 53:24)

cool hi SBJ I've been I have become a (54:58 - 55:03)
big fan of the show in the past few (55:01 - 55:05)
weeks my first pot cat my first podcast (55:03 - 55:07)
was actually the dungeons and dragon (55:05 - 55:09)
heights podcast and I've been listening (55:07 - 55:12)
lately since this podcast has got me (55:09 - 55:13)
interested in dungeons of Dragon Knights (55:12 - 55:14)
and I've gotten a few my friends (55:13 - 55:16)
interested we are learning to play I (55:14 - 55:18)
thought I heard Greg said though there (55:16 - 55:21)
was something about a posting of his (55:18 - 55:23)
dungeon master notes online I have not (55:21 - 55:24)
been able to find them and I was (55:23 - 55:25)
wondering if you would be able to send (55:24 - 55:27)
me a PDF or a word document or just make (55:25 - 55:30)
the link available on the Internet if (55:27 - 55:31)

said I I have most of the files but not (55:49 - 55:54)

peeled for that I think a lot now that (56:00 - 56:09)
we're so far into the campaign I think (56:04 - 56:11)
everything's kind of ironed out for the (56:09 - 56:13)
most Martin like especially with my (56:11 - 56:15)
character which was a little more custom (56:13 - 56:17)
things weren't really ironed out to like (56:15 - 56:19)
episode 3 and 4 with with moves and (56:17 - 56:22)
stuff so yeah just keep keep your eyes (56:19 - 56:23)

Caleb rights in here hey SBJ will Travis (56:38 - 56:44)
Logan Micah and many other people that (56:42 - 56:45)
I've missed I started listening to the (56:44 - 56:48)
podcast just before 199 after looking (56:45 - 56:50)
for a podcast that was talking about (56:48 - 56:52)
Pokemon super mystery dungeon I wanted (56:50 - 56:54)
to hear other's thoughts and I've been a (56:52 - 56:57)
faithful listener since as a big fan of (56:54 - 56:58)
Polk was opposed to all the heretical (56:57 - 57:01)
listeners that that don't think that I'm (56:58 - 57:04)
the best co-host as a big fan of Pokemon (57:01 - 57:06)
super mystery to put my mystery dungeon (57:04 - 57:08)
series as well as the pokemon ranger (57:06 - 57:10)
series i've played explores the sky (57:08 - 57:13)
super mystery dungeon shadows of Almia (57:10 - 57:16)
all of which I've enjoyed I'd like to (57:13 - 57:18)
hear what you guys would like to see in (57:16 - 57:20)
the series if another one was to be (57:18 - 57:22)
released I know that Travis likes (57:20 - 57:25)
pokemon mystery dungeon and I know will (57:22 - 57:27)
likes pokemon ranger i'm curious to hear (57:25 - 57:30)
your thoughts i also encourage travis to (57:27 - 57:32)
struggle through the beginning of (57:30 - 57:34)
pokemon super mystery dungeon i consider (57:32 - 57:37)
the entire time i spent playing that (57:34 - 57:38)
game was worth it even the beginning and (57:37 - 57:40)
then by the way i really recommend (57:38 - 57:42)
pokemon mystery dungeon series to (57:40 - 57:45)
everyone listening I know roguelikes and (57:42 - 57:46)
story games are loved by everyone but I (57:45 - 57:48)
think everyone should give it a try if (57:46 - 57:49)
you tried gates to infinity and didn't (57:48 - 57:52)
like it play one of the others by now (57:49 - 57:53)
I'm probably taking up a good chunk of (57:52 - 57:55)
the episode you are welcome so I'll (57:53 - 57:56)
close this email keep up the good work (57:55 - 57:59)
you guys are awesome and then puts a (57:56 - 58:03)
minecraft master is uh I believe that's (57:59 - 58:04)
a slack name I believe this is one of (58:03 - 58:07)
our slack listeners yeah mm-hmm maybe i (58:04 - 58:09)
will give super mystery dungeon another (58:07 - 58:12)
try once i get some time on my hands (58:09 - 58:14)
work slowing down a little bit so i (58:12 - 58:16)
might be able to i were to pick (58:14 - 58:20)
something to add to super mystery (58:16 - 58:21)
dungeon or something i would like to see (58:20 - 58:24)
in a future installment I don't know (58:21 - 58:27)
it's it's never been like this the (58:24 - 58:29)
specific because mr. dungeon 2 is my (58:27 - 58:32)
favorite of those and it was never that (58:29 - 58:35)
it was a specific mechanic that really (58:32 - 58:38)
what made me love that game as much as (58:35 - 58:39)
it was that (58:38 - 58:43)
was the first time other than Brett well (58:39 - 58:45)
other than the show I guess it was the (58:43 - 58:48)
first time that a Pokemon a piece of (58:45 - 58:52)
Pokemon media made a Pokemon really feel (58:48 - 58:53)
like a character or the personality and (58:52 - 58:54)
I realize that's partly due to because (58:53 - 58:58)
the fact that these Pokemon talk but I (58:54 - 59:00)
was just sort of blown away by the fact (58:58 - 59:02)
that it made me care about the (59:00 - 59:04)
characters and a Pokemon game I can't (59:02 - 59:06)
really pinpoint one thing that I would (59:04 - 59:08)
like to see cuz it's not necessarily the (59:06 - 59:10)
fact that the game is a roguelike that (59:08 - 59:11)
makes me like it as much as the fact (59:10 - 59:13)
that I just thought it the storytelling (59:11 - 59:15)
was really good so it's hard for me to (59:13 - 59:18)
pinpoint one mechanic but as long as it (59:15 - 59:21)
those games continue to be story focused (59:18 - 59:24)
i'll continue to be interested and i (59:21 - 59:27)
guess i have to get through the (59:24 - 59:28)
beginning of super mystery dungeon to (59:27 - 59:31)
see that but i don't know and for me for (59:28 - 59:33)
pokemon ranger i think i've said it (59:31 - 59:35)
before but I'm going to keep campaigning (59:33 - 59:38)
for this I would love to see a main (59:35 - 59:40)
series pokemon game that allows you to (59:38 - 59:42)
choose somewhere near the beginning (59:40 - 59:44)
whether you want to be a pokemon trainer (59:42 - 59:47)
or a pokemon ranger and then how you (59:44 - 59:50)
actually collect and manage your pokemon (59:47 - 59:52)
throughout the rest of the game is done (59:50 - 59:55)
using either that mechanic or the other (59:52 - 59:57)
and then also allow you to switch back (59:55 - 60:00)
and forth um so you can kind of have the (59:57 - 60:01)
experience of both without having to (60:00 - 60:03)
completely reset your game I just think (60:01 - 60:05)
that would be awesome like oh you're (60:03 - 60:07)
doing you're yourself you're a region (60:05 - 60:09)
that's somewhere like between a trainer (60:07 - 60:11)
region and a ranger region so that (60:09 - 60:13)
people like pick which they want to be (60:11 - 60:17)
in you know as their life path that'd be (60:13 - 60:19)
awesome it would be cool they've always (60:17 - 60:22)
and I mean its first one it was here and (60:19 - 60:24)
you say that I was like oh they would (60:22 - 60:27)
never do that but then again I'm (60:24 - 60:29)
thinking about how in each game they (60:27 - 60:33)
have progressively encouraged thee well (60:29 - 60:34)
I guess not really I guess it hit its (60:33 - 60:36)
peak in gen 3 but they always do sort of (60:34 - 60:40)
encourage the contest or musical or (60:36 - 60:43)
whatever variant of that is in each game (60:40 - 60:47)
so that so i mean the the ranger aspect (60:43 - 60:49)
of it could be a akin to that but a (60:47 - 60:51)
little more fleshed out so i guess it's (60:49 - 60:52)
not really out of the realm of (60:51 - 60:53)
possibility (60:52 - 60:56)
anything is possible with dreams and (60:53 - 60:59)
imagination and their pokemon that our (60:56 - 61:06)
dream ones like dark rye and moon chakra (60:59 - 61:09)
we have the input we got a bunch more (61:06 - 61:11)
emails but we'll save those for next (61:09 - 61:14)
week again if you want to write in spj a (61:11 - 61:17)
poke at pkmn casscom or pokémon (61:14 - 61:20)
podcast.com slash contact either way (61:17 - 61:24)
we'll get an email to myself let's move (61:20 - 61:27)
on to our pokemon of the week which is i (61:24 - 61:29)
know for sure we have not done before (61:27 - 61:36)
Agron the iron armor Pokemon Travis will (61:29 - 61:39)
have a move set here as I read some (61:36 - 61:42)
biology real slow because I need to make (61:39 - 61:45)
a move time I'll I've got something to (61:42 - 61:47)
say to after you do your biology biz (61:45 - 61:51)
okay stall stall stall it out stall it (61:47 - 61:53)
up there's a lot of big words his with (61:51 - 61:57)
us worries me the gouges on a grounds (61:53 - 61:59)
armor from previous battles are worn as (61:57 - 62:03)
mementos of the more wounds it has the (61:59 - 62:06)
more it has battled it claims a large (62:03 - 62:08)
mountain as its territory and fiercely (62:06 - 62:10)
defends it from trespassers if its (62:08 - 62:12)
environment is damaged by a flood or (62:10 - 62:15)
forest fire it will restore the area by (62:12 - 62:19)
bringing in topsoil and planting trees (62:15 - 62:22)
it burrows through the strongest of (62:19 - 62:25)
bedrock and digs tunnels as it searches (62:22 - 62:28)
for iron to eat its horns which it uses (62:25 - 62:31)
to dig through bedrock when seeking food (62:28 - 62:35)
grow a little longer at a time and can (62:31 - 62:39)
be used to determine its age like the (62:35 - 62:41)
rings on a tree when I said there's a (62:39 - 62:43)
lot of big words I was referring to (62:41 - 62:48)
topsoil head rock I you know I didn't (62:43 - 62:50)
even realize that Ron had a mega (62:48 - 62:53)
evolution Wow yep there's so many now (62:50 - 62:55)
it's hard to keep track um no I was (62:53 - 62:58)
gonna say that the first form Aaron (62:55 - 63:01)
Aaron whatever you want to call it um (62:58 - 63:04)
there is a competitive strategy that's (63:01 - 63:07)
not great but like called the fierce try (63:04 - 63:12)
Oh GFE are on that Aaron was known for (63:07 - 63:16)
where you put a focus sash on it you use (63:12 - 63:19)
the Move endeavor uh some other attack (63:16 - 63:26)
and R stands for Oh usually ratata sash (63:19 - 63:29)
endeavor quick attack Rattata is usually (63:26 - 63:31)
like it's usually a rattata well I mean (63:29 - 63:33)
it was originally a rattata but Aaron is (63:31 - 63:35)
a lot better for him yes basically what (63:33 - 63:37)
you do it with the focus sash you can (63:35 - 63:40)
get Aaron down to one health and then (63:37 - 63:42)
use endeavor and that means your enemy (63:40 - 63:45)
is down to one health and quick attack (63:42 - 63:49)
is okay for the next right to take off (63:45 - 63:51)
that one health point but with Aaron (63:49 - 63:54)
since its immune to sand storms and to (63:51 - 63:57)
poison you could actually have a (63:54 - 63:59)
sandstorm going and the sandstorm would (63:57 - 64:03)
take off that one last help HP from your (63:59 - 64:06)
enemy so that's just an entrance (64:03 - 64:09)
interesting trivia of Aaron now that's (64:06 - 64:11)
all the time I could go for I got some (64:09 - 64:14)
trivia if Travis needs more time I can I (64:11 - 64:17)
can I can go all right all right all (64:14 - 64:22)
right coo coo we can we can build well (64:17 - 64:24)
as long as you're gonna allow me to do (64:22 - 64:27)
the the mega evolution version of it (64:24 - 64:29)
yeah sure I mean if thats what i was the (64:27 - 64:31)
most viable a ground that's what we want (64:29 - 64:34)
to give to people the only only the (64:31 - 64:38)
finest of a groans um I forgot until (64:34 - 64:42)
making this set that mega Agron loses (64:38 - 64:46)
its the rock type of Agron so I was (64:42 - 64:49)
originally thinking oh heavy slam and (64:46 - 64:52)
stone edge for the stab but actually um (64:49 - 64:55)
it loses the rock typing when it mega (64:52 - 64:58)
evolves so we're just going to do well (64:55 - 64:59)
the items can be a great obviously the (64:58 - 65:01)
mega evolve and then the set is gonna be (64:59 - 65:04)
stealth rock heavy slam thunder wave and (65:01 - 65:07)
roar this is gonna be as you can tell i (65:04 - 65:10)
primarily defensive set biz therefore (65:07 - 65:13)
playing off Agron strengths you're only (65:10 - 65:15)
going to do this if you have another (65:13 - 65:17)
Pokemon that's putting down some other (65:15 - 65:20)
type of hazard because just Stealth Rock (65:17 - 65:21)
isn't (65:20 - 65:24)
enough to justify the war placement (65:21 - 65:26)
there so if you're not running other (65:24 - 65:28)
pokemon with spikes or sticky web or (65:26 - 65:33)
toxic spikes then instead of roar you (65:28 - 65:35)
could do stealth rock heavy slam thunder (65:33 - 65:38)
wave and an earthquake perhaps and then (65:35 - 65:43)
4 v's will do 252 HP and because its (65:38 - 65:46)
defense is already astronomically high (65:43 - 65:48)
at two-thirty will invest in special (65:46 - 65:50)
defense to make it to provide some other (65:48 - 65:54)
hits 0 2 52 in a a special defense as (65:50 - 65:56)
well the way you're going to use this (65:54 - 65:59)
set is you'll have another Pokemon set (65:56 - 66:02)
up your other entry hazard you'll bring (65:59 - 66:05)
in mega agron twice agron if you haven't (66:02 - 66:07)
mega evolved it yet but you'll bring an (66:05 - 66:11)
agron to take a hit and then you'll set (66:07 - 66:13)
up stealth rocks hopefully it'll be able (66:11 - 66:15)
to do that I mean given how much bulk it (66:13 - 66:17)
has it will most likely be able to and (66:15 - 66:20)
if it's able to take another hit you can (66:17 - 66:24)
start um start using roar to get free (66:20 - 66:26)
damage on all these Pokemon let's switch (66:24 - 66:30)
in and impose some disadvantageous (66:26 - 66:34)
switches for your opponent thunder wave (66:30 - 66:35)
is in there just because it's nice to (66:34 - 66:37)
have a status effect that you can throw (66:35 - 66:40)
out when you're expecting a switch in (66:37 - 66:42)
maybe to a sweeper that would be (66:40 - 66:45)
disabled by by something like thunder (66:42 - 66:48)
wave and then heavy slim is in there (66:45 - 66:50)
just because the base attack even if (66:48 - 66:51)
we're not investing at the base attack (66:50 - 66:54)
of my gag rounds 1-40 so nothing to (66:51 - 66:56)
shake it and especially considering how (66:54 - 66:59)
heavy mega agron is that heavy slam can (66:56 - 67:01)
hit pretty hard so that's about the gist (66:59 - 67:05)
of it this is obese ability what's not I (67:01 - 67:08)
said he or she I suppose has a sweet (67:05 - 67:10)
ability okay filter filter is pretty (67:08 - 67:13)
cool yeah reduces super effective (67:10 - 67:15)
damaged by one for a move that would (67:13 - 67:16)
deal times to damage wouldn't ste (67:15 - 67:19)
instead deal 1.5 times damage and a move (67:16 - 67:21)
that would deal times for damage would (67:19 - 67:24)
deal instead three times damage then (67:21 - 67:26)
that really helps with one of three (67:24 - 67:28)
pokemon that know it that really helps (67:26 - 67:30)
with the bulk too because you know even (67:28 - 67:33)
if you so you're you're unlikely to (67:30 - 67:34)
switch right if your opponent has like a (67:33 - 67:37)
fire-type pokemon out so you would be (67:34 - 67:38)
unlikely to switch into my guy ground in (67:37 - 67:42)
that case but let's say you're against (67:38 - 67:46)
like a pokemon the nose flamethrower (67:42 - 67:48)
that is not a fire-type pokemon you (67:46 - 67:50)
switch into mega a ground thinking (67:48 - 67:52)
you're gonna be ok because it's nothing (67:50 - 67:54)
because its type isn't super effective (67:52 - 67:56)
against my gag Ron even if your opponent (67:54 - 67:58)
predicts a switch into mega agron it (67:56 - 68:00)
uses flamethrower because it's not (67:58 - 68:04)
getting the stab and its end I agron has (68:00 - 68:06)
filter it's not going to be as (68:04 - 68:08)
devastating as if it as if it didn't I (68:06 - 68:10)
mean it's not a huge reduction in damage (68:08 - 68:12)
but it's definitely significant agron is (68:10 - 68:15)
the only dueled duel type Pokemon to (68:12 - 68:18)
lose a type up on mega evolution you (68:15 - 68:21)
know so surprised said earlier mega a (68:18 - 68:24)
grad is the only Pierce type pure steel (68:21 - 68:26)
steel type pokémon only Michael Stipe (68:24 - 68:29)
Pokemon to ever frontman r am only (68:26 - 68:33)
pietersite pure luck ash pure steel type (68:29 - 68:37)
pokémon that is not genderless agron is (68:33 - 68:41)
the heaviest rock-type pokémon mega (68:37 - 68:43)
agron is tied with Shuckle and mega (68:41 - 68:46)
steelix for the highest based at defense (68:43 - 68:49)
of all pokemon omega agron is also tied (68:46 - 68:51)
with mega steelix for the highest single (68:49 - 68:55)
base set of all mega-evolved pokémon (68:51 - 68:57)
which i think in this case is defense (68:55 - 69:00)
and yeah not that much trivia a shiny a (68:57 - 69:05)
Grom is like a turquoise instead of a (69:00 - 69:08)
grey mm-hmm that's pretty nice I like (69:05 - 69:11)
that yeah it's not like that ugly green (69:08 - 69:15)
not that ugly ugly green well that's our (69:11 - 69:19)
show yeah that's that's everything (69:15 - 69:23)
