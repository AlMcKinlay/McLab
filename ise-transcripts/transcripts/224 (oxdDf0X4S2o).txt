good afternoon we are in a (0:31 - 0:36)
non-traditional recording time once (0:34 - 0:38)
again once it's it's been a crazy couple (0:36 - 0:41)
weeks I feel although we've been getting (0:38 - 0:42)
the episodes out consistently so that's (0:41 - 0:44)
all that matters that's what's important (0:42 - 0:47)
to you that it is important to me it's (0:44 - 0:49)
important to me to deliver on a weekly (0:47 - 0:53)
basis of Pokemon goodness in people's (0:49 - 0:56)
ears this episode is probably gonna be (0:53 - 0:59)
pretty pokemon go heavy but before we (0:56 - 1:02)
get to that will how's your weekend my (0:59 - 1:04)
weekends barely existed how does mean (1:02 - 1:07)
how's your week how's your light how's (1:04 - 1:10)
your life well I mean they released the (1:07 - 1:13)
Destiny year two moments of triumph and (1:10 - 1:16)
I realized how sorry of a human being I (1:13 - 1:18)
am when I pulled mine up and I only have (1:16 - 1:23)
one out of what is eight or six eight I (1:18 - 1:25)
think yes I only have one out of the (1:23 - 1:28)
eight done so i have to bust myself to (1:25 - 1:31)
get the other seven done that's what i (1:28 - 1:33)
was doing last night oh man I I had the (1:31 - 1:35)
opposite i logged in picked up my book (1:33 - 1:37)
and they were all done strangely enough (1:35 - 1:39)
like the year one moment of triumph was (1:37 - 1:42)
like that for me but year too not so (1:39 - 1:44)
much yeah I think the only thing you had (1:42 - 1:47)
left for your one was skull loss yeah (1:44 - 1:50)
prison of elders dealio yeah and now (1:47 - 1:52)
there's a lot of things about destiny (1:50 - 1:54)
that I don't understand anymore but (1:52 - 1:57)
collecting calcium fragments are good (1:54 - 1:59)
quitted though they're calcified (1:57 - 2:01)
fragments calcified yeah at that I (1:59 - 2:02)
understand because I have an app on my (2:01 - 2:04)
phone that tells me exactly where to go (2:02 - 2:06)
awesome yeah that didn't exist back when (2:04 - 2:09)
I was searching for the moment I watched (2:06 - 2:11)
like 50 individual youtube videos that (2:09 - 2:15)
walked you to each one and yeah that was (2:11 - 2:17)
a pain so how was your week been it's (2:15 - 2:20)
been good it's been super busy super (2:17 - 2:26)
weird it's weird yeah i would say that (2:20 - 2:31)
july is more of a chill month for me is (2:26 - 2:33)
this is this a known app month or (2:31 - 2:35)
our naps allowed in July ah I haven't (2:33 - 2:38)
napped in a while actually I take that (2:35 - 2:41)
back I took a nap last night because I (2:38 - 2:43)
was purposely trying to throw off my (2:41 - 2:47)
sleep schedule and that's why twice I (2:43 - 2:51)
got home did some stuff slept from like (2:47 - 2:54)
8pm to 10pm and then i stayed up till (2:51 - 2:59)
5am then i slept through about 11 so I (2:54 - 3:01)
could go to sleep earlier tonight (2:59 - 3:02)
because I have to catch a flight (3:01 - 3:04)
tomorrow which is part of the weirdness (3:02 - 3:08)
of if you were to ask me Thursday what I (3:04 - 3:10)
would have been doing this weekend I (3:08 - 3:12)
would have told you that this is my (3:10 - 3:15)
first weekend in like five weeks that (3:12 - 3:17)
I'm actually going to be home I'm gonna (3:15 - 3:19)
do nothing I did all my yard work early (3:17 - 3:22)
i started cleaning like this was going (3:19 - 3:23)
to be my weekend where i was going to do (3:22 - 3:27)
nothing except ketchup on nothing and (3:23 - 3:31)
thursday dramatically changed and i made (3:27 - 3:32)
some phone calls got some phone calls (3:31 - 3:35)
and now i'm flying out to atlanta on (3:32 - 3:39)
sunday tomorrow hopefully the episode (3:35 - 3:41)
will be live i'm going to cut and edit (3:39 - 3:42)
it and publish it at the same time and (3:41 - 3:45)
then meeting with some people recording (3:42 - 3:47)
some stuff and then flying back on (3:45 - 3:50)
tuesday and that all happened within (3:47 - 3:53)
like a two hour time span of going from (3:50 - 3:55)
am doing nothing this weekend too I'm (3:53 - 3:57)
flying out to Atlanta and I've never (3:55 - 4:00)
been to Atlanta and yeah so it's just a (3:57 - 4:03)
crazy week and then on top of that this (4:00 - 4:05)
can kind of bring us into Pokemon news (4:03 - 4:09)
here I got an email from pax West last (4:05 - 4:11)
night which is who they formerly called (4:09 - 4:14)
pax prime but I think PAX East is bigger (4:11 - 4:17)
than pax prime so they named it packs (4:14 - 4:20)
West at it the one in Seattle the packs (4:17 - 4:22)
in Seattle so I got an email last night (4:20 - 4:25)
that my panel which is just a Pokemon (4:22 - 4:28)
panel got accepted and so I guess on (4:25 - 4:30)
like September second I'm going to be (4:28 - 4:33)
flying out to seattle to speak and yeah (4:30 - 4:35)
that was also super unexpected and i've (4:33 - 4:37)
never been to Atlanta I've never been to (4:35 - 4:40)
Seattle I actually don't fly a lot first (4:37 - 4:43)
time I flown was when I went two worlds (4:40 - 4:45)
I think yeah (4:43 - 4:51)
yeah that was what 2010-2011 2011-2012 I (4:45 - 4:53)
think that was the first time you were (4:51 - 4:55)
ever in an airplane for years ago and (4:53 - 4:57)
look at you now the commitment of day (4:55 - 5:00)
Jet Center yeah so what was funny as (4:57 - 5:01)
earlier in the week I was planning to (5:00 - 5:05)
visit you in DC because Irene is Irene (5:01 - 5:07)
wants the good old white house she wants (5:05 - 5:08)
to do all the she wants to do the deed (5:07 - 5:11)
did the DC tour whatever people go to DC (5:08 - 5:13)
for I'm sure you see where I leave DC (5:11 - 5:16)
yes it would be a good idea to get it in (5:13 - 5:18)
I'm sure there are plenty of tourists in (5:16 - 5:23)
DC I don't know if you can spot them as (5:18 - 5:28)
easily as other normal people but it's (5:23 - 5:29)
it's very easy to spot them because (5:28 - 5:31)
they're not in my neighborhood so (5:29 - 5:34)
typically when you go out of my (5:31 - 5:36)
neighborhood then you say oh look (5:34 - 5:38)
there's a tourist I'm assuming they have (5:36 - 5:40)
the they they're probably they probably (5:38 - 5:42)
look like they're playing pokemon go but (5:40 - 5:43)
instead they're just taking pictures of (5:42 - 5:47)
everything in DC yeah uh yeah so I was (5:43 - 5:50)
trying to plan a DC trip at the end of (5:47 - 5:53)
august so if this all works out well (5:50 - 5:54)
obviously this week I'm working out (5:53 - 5:56)
because I already booked my flight and (5:54 - 5:57)
hotel and I don't think I'm getting that (5:56 - 6:00)
money back so I'm going to atl this week (5:57 - 6:04)
Hotlanta Hotlanta folio yeah I'm staying (6:00 - 6:06)
downtown i already had a fan or two (6:04 - 6:08)
messaged me asking if we could get lunch (6:06 - 6:12)
which is cool then the end of alt and (6:08 - 6:14)
then at the end of july the beginning of (6:12 - 6:16)
august i'm going to gencon meeting (6:14 - 6:18)
meeting up with you and logan and jeff (6:16 - 6:21)
and i think travis said he's coming and (6:18 - 6:24)
Greg and I'm forgetting people and I (6:21 - 6:28)
apologize and then after that I at the (6:24 - 6:29)
end of august i'm supposed to be going (6:28 - 6:31)
to Washington DC and like two days after (6:29 - 6:35)
I get back from DC I'm supposed to now (6:31 - 6:37)
go to Seattle I don't know how I'm gonna (6:35 - 6:41)
stay employed really yeah just work (6:37 - 6:44)
remotely yeah i mean i could I the (6:41 - 6:46)
seattle one works out actually really (6:44 - 6:48)
well because it's it's a friday saturday (6:46 - 6:51)
sunday monday convention and mondays (6:48 - 6:54)
labor day so i can actually go to work (6:51 - 6:57)
on friday fly out saturday morning (6:54 - 6:58)
because my i wouldn't be able to check (6:57 - 6:59)
into (6:58 - 7:02)
hotel until 3pm anyways do the saturday (6:59 - 7:05)
do full day Sunday and then I speak on (7:02 - 7:06)
Monday and then I only actually have to (7:05 - 7:08)
take one day off which is tuesday and (7:06 - 7:12)
then i'll use that day to fly back so (7:08 - 7:13)
that one actually works out pretty well (7:12 - 7:16)
and then the white house where the DC (7:13 - 7:18)
one is weird because that's just (7:16 - 7:20)
dependent on when i'm allowed to do a (7:18 - 7:23)
white house tour whatnot so and i'm (7:20 - 7:24)
staying with you so i don't have to (7:23 - 7:25)
worry about a hotel it's just flexible (7:24 - 7:28)
with the plane you know what's gonna (7:25 - 7:30)
happen is you're gonna stay with me for (7:28 - 7:32)
one night and then you're gonna have to (7:30 - 7:35)
worry about a hotel once you see what my (7:32 - 7:39)
house is all I man when I walk in I hope (7:35 - 7:41)
there's like a vacuum right away ready (7:39 - 7:43)
good to go and let you keep it vacuum by (7:41 - 7:45)
the front door so you're already in luck (7:43 - 7:48)
on that front let's drop the bags off (7:45 - 7:51)
start vacuuming start cleaning no it's (7:48 - 7:53)
really the mold remediation that you (7:51 - 7:56)

window is back here you have a you have (7:56 - 8:01)

great place to meet let's talk about (8:55 - 9:00)
some Pokemon news so as of right now (8:57 - 9:03)
we're recording at about 4pm central (9:00 - 9:06)
time on saturday it looks like the (9:03 - 9:09)
pokemon go servers are down we'll get (9:06 - 9:12)
we'll get more into that I've been doing (9:09 - 9:13)
a side Siri (9:12 - 9:17)
with with just reporting day by day by (9:13 - 9:20)
day and Pokemon go I think the the news (9:17 - 9:22)
that kind of got overshadowed this week (9:20 - 9:25)
was a new Pokemon was revealed that was (9:22 - 9:28)
revealed on Thursday morning which was (9:25 - 9:31)
Sal and it some way to eat something (9:28 - 9:33)
like that I think it's supposed to be (9:31 - 9:38)
like salamander and bandit bandit Oh is (9:33 - 9:40)
Sosa landed yeah there you that I (9:38 - 9:42)
thought about this do you know how (9:40 - 9:44)
harshly I was criticized for my (9:42 - 9:49)
pronunciation of bones Lee bones bonsly (9:44 - 9:52)
bonsly is what somebody told me bouncing (9:49 - 9:55)
I think it is why bond sly cuz i had a (9:52 - 10:02)
bonsai tree ah bones yeah yeah yeah so (9:55 - 10:04)
we'll go whistle and it and make that (10:02 - 10:06)
the official pronunciation immediately (10:04 - 10:08)
alright yeah I'm feeling good about this (10:06 - 10:11)
name so Landon is the first-ever (10:08 - 10:14)
poisoned fire-type pokemon that will (10:11 - 10:18)
invade the Aloha region I got that right (10:14 - 10:21)
as Selanne did is also the first (10:18 - 10:23)
poison-type pokemon revealed for the (10:21 - 10:25)
Aloha region and it is the second (10:23 - 10:27)
fire-type pokemon to be shown besides (10:25 - 10:31)
Lytton it looks like so Landon has a new (10:27 - 10:33)
poison type attack but I don't think (10:31 - 10:37)
that it's hack was named the the special (10:33 - 10:39)
thing about solana though it is it has (10:37 - 10:42)
an ability which lets it poison any type (10:39 - 10:44)
of Pokemon including other poison-type (10:42 - 10:46)
pokemon and steel type pokémon I think (10:44 - 10:49)
those are the main two that are immune (10:46 - 10:50)
yeah those are the only two that are (10:49 - 10:55)
immune and yes its ability is corrosion (10:50 - 10:59)
and with that it can it can poison um (10:55 - 11:02)
well yeah it's poison types of Steel (10:59 - 11:03)
types and then the question is if (11:02 - 11:05)
there's something else that's preventing (11:03 - 11:10)
poison damage whether it can also affect (11:05 - 11:12)
those I don't know if there's anything (11:10 - 11:13)
out there that prevents poison oh well (11:12 - 11:17)
yeah what's his name nuttin ko olina (11:13 - 11:20)
koala koala I was going to say the one I (11:17 - 11:23)
when I saw the ability I saw what it did (11:20 - 11:25)
the first thing I thought of was welcome (11:23 - 11:27)
Allah's ability is it can't take (11:25 - 11:29)
any status effect because of its always (11:27 - 11:31)
asleep so how does that work yeah I (11:29 - 11:32)
don't think they showed anything in (11:31 - 11:35)
regards to that they showed cyl and it (11:32 - 11:38)
fighting a zubat and fighting a skarmory (11:35 - 11:43)
and a rock rough still a good name hey (11:38 - 11:46)
but and then also that you know I good (11:43 - 11:48)
oh I'll never get his name right (11:46 - 11:52)
Nicaragua Kamala why is that so hard for (11:48 - 11:54)
me I'm rubbing off on you that's why oh (11:52 - 11:59)
that is such a horrifying thought um but (11:54 - 12:01)
anyways Topo Gigio you know his ability (11:59 - 12:04)
is ready mix the oil I was like what is (12:01 - 12:06)
a topo gigio if that little it's the (12:04 - 12:10)
pikachu no no no the the mystical the (12:06 - 12:13)
guardian of meili meili island tipo kuru (12:10 - 12:16)
kuru tobacker ooh oh you mean the like (12:13 - 12:19)
the Guardian thing yeah okay so his (12:16 - 12:21)
ability creates electric terrain which (12:19 - 12:24)
prevents sleep so does that mean that (12:21 - 12:27)
Kamala can have no status conditions I (12:24 - 12:30)
don't know circumstance are they like (12:27 - 12:31)
pitching this generation is like a (12:30 - 12:35)
status heavy ability heavy i don't know (12:31 - 12:39)
maybe maybe I got a pokedex entry 4 cyl (12:35 - 12:42)
andit cyl and it emits a toxic gas (12:39 - 12:45)
together with flames from the base of (12:42 - 12:47)
its tail the poisonous gas has a sweet (12:45 - 12:50)
smell and anyone who unknowingly (12:47 - 12:52)
breathes it in will become dizzy soul (12:50 - 12:55)
and it is not a very powerful pokemon (12:52 - 12:58)
but its cunning nature allows it to (12:55 - 13:00)
battle fiercely by throwing its (12:58 - 13:02)
opponents off balance i was going to say (13:00 - 13:04)
i will say that there are quite a few (13:02 - 13:07)
geckos in hawaii so this is going to be (13:04 - 13:10)
kind of like a gecko Pokemon there you (13:07 - 13:12)
go yeah yeah I also have saline and (13:10 - 13:15)
females not only release toxic gases (13:12 - 13:18)
they can also emit pheromones that (13:15 - 13:21)
attract males of all species including (13:18 - 13:24)
both humans and Pokemon inhaling these (13:21 - 13:27)
pheromones may cause opponents to be (13:24 - 13:30)
controlled by Selanne its will I like (13:27 - 13:33)
just I have to like take a second to (13:30 - 13:34)
pronounce it because it doesn't roll off (13:33 - 13:38)
the tongue that easy yes so that's the (13:34 - 13:40)
new pokemon that was shown (13:38 - 13:45)
I don't know if that was to not like to (13:40 - 13:47)
not take away news from Pokemon go but (13:45 - 13:51)
to also just remind people when Pokemon (13:47 - 13:54)
go hits that there is new Pokemon and a (13:51 - 13:56)
new game coming here's a here's like a (13:54 - 13:59)
little taste of that oh I just realized (13:56 - 14:02)
his head like it's a darker color and it (13:59 - 14:05)
has it two ears coming out and it's kind (14:02 - 14:08)
of like it's wearing a mask and it's (14:05 - 14:13)
tied in the back oh I love Pokemon was (14:08 - 14:16)
it that it's existed for like a decade (14:13 - 14:17)
and I was like oh that Pokemon has a (14:16 - 14:19)
tail I never noticed that in 10 names (14:17 - 14:23)
like clefairy we got yet we got some (14:19 - 14:25)
news about Pokemon go besides it not (14:23 - 14:27)
working the antic puts Pokemon goal goes (14:25 - 14:31)
international roll out on hold following (14:27 - 14:33)
me much anticipated launch of Pokemon go (14:31 - 14:34)
which was supposed to be a worldwide (14:33 - 14:36)
release for my understanding it was (14:34 - 14:38)
released first in Australia then New (14:36 - 14:40)
Zealand and then the United States (14:38 - 14:44)
Pokemon goes popularity did not come as (14:40 - 14:46)
much of a surprise knee antics servers (14:44 - 14:48)
however took a very heavy hit (14:46 - 14:50)
significant number of fans had (14:48 - 14:53)
connectivity issues as a result along (14:50 - 14:55)
with logging into their pokemon trainer (14:53 - 14:57)
club accounts the company acknowledged (14:55 - 14:59)
the issue they are still working hard to (14:57 - 15:03)
fix the servers speaking of recent (14:59 - 15:06)
events knee antics CEO John Hanke told (15:03 - 15:08)
Business Insider that their team is hard (15:06 - 15:11)
at work and admit the heavy server load (15:08 - 15:13)
the international rollout of Pokemon go (15:11 - 15:15)
four countries including the United (15:13 - 15:17)
Kingdom and the Netherlands among others (15:15 - 15:19)
will temporarily be put on hold until (15:17 - 15:21)
the company feels comfortable in (15:19 - 15:24)
addition to Japan Pokemon go has been (15:21 - 15:26)
confirmed to make its way to South (15:24 - 15:31)
America Canada and Europe I can totally (15:26 - 15:34)
understand and (15:31 - 15:34)
I get the frustration for UK or Canada (15:34 - 15:40)
or South America or wherever poke (15:38 - 15:42)
is not it's frustrating that this game (15:40 - 15:44)
is out and you guys can't get it but at (15:42 - 15:47)
the same time even if they did roll it (15:44 - 15:49)
out at this point you wouldn't be able (15:47 - 15:50)
to log in you would have the same (15:49 - 15:52)
frustrations everyone else is having of (15:50 - 15:56)
trying to log in and try and trying to (15:52 - 15:58)
play the game and adding more people (15:56 - 16:00)
right now was not the proper solution (15:58 - 16:01)
yeah i was able to get in this morning (16:00 - 16:03)
though after because i was able to get (16:01 - 16:05)
in the first morning and then never get (16:03 - 16:07)
in again and then i was able to get in (16:05 - 16:10)
again this morning so they probably have (16:07 - 16:13)
done something to improve the at least (16:10 - 16:15)

stuff yeah yeah and I have a friend in (16:15 - 16:22)

point where the UK has now I know those (16:24 - 16:30)
people are probably side loading from (16:28 - 16:32)

they'll probably have like an umbreon (18:54 - 18:58)
and espeon soon yeah that's what I would (18:55 - 18:59)
assume I would act i would assume be how (18:58 - 19:02)
they come together (18:59 - 19:02)
do is we'll take a quick break and then (19:02 - 19:07)
when we come back we will go more in (19:05 - 19:11)
depth with Pokemon go (19:07 - 19:11)
and we are back let's talk about some (19:40 - 19:48)
Pokemon go I think I had another news (19:45 - 19:50)
article I have a complied in the news (19:48 - 19:52)
section and you said there's no more (19:50 - 19:53)
news and now you're like there's more (19:52 - 19:56)
news no I mean this is it's it's more of (19:53 - 19:59)
an opinion piece then then news but (19:56 - 20:02)
before we get to that I think I'm sure (19:59 - 20:03)
our listeners I've heard my thoughts so (20:02 - 20:06)
far on Pokemon go but uh let's let's (20:03 - 20:07)
hear your thoughts you you said you (20:06 - 20:10)
played for a bit I mean I've enjoyed it (20:07 - 20:13)
a little i'm not gonna be one of those (20:10 - 20:15)
people like it's like super intense (20:13 - 20:18)
about collecting catching them all and (20:15 - 20:21)
etc and like trying to do everything (20:18 - 20:24)
that's in there but i'll play it like I (20:21 - 20:26)
play most casual games like you know (20:24 - 20:30)
you're right like I still play pokemon (20:26 - 20:32)
pick cross every day right I have put (20:30 - 20:34)
zero dollars into it and all I do is I (20:32 - 20:36)
go in and I do the daily puzzle and get (20:34 - 20:39)
my 11 pick rights out of that and then (20:36 - 20:42)
like if I can pay for something I pay (20:39 - 20:44)
for something using pick rights if I (20:42 - 20:45)
can't pay for something I close it and I (20:44 - 20:48)
like well I'll come back the next day so (20:45 - 20:50)
I'll do the same with Pokemon go because (20:48 - 20:56)
there's I think six pokey stops on the (20:50 - 20:58)
my normal walk that I take my dog every (20:56 - 21:00)
morning I'll just go through pick up my (20:58 - 21:03)
pokeballs from the pokeball pokey stops (21:00 - 21:07)
and if there's any Pokemon along the way (21:03 - 21:09)
I'll try to catch them which is very (21:07 - 21:11)
hard to do when you're walking a dog but (21:09 - 21:15)
I'm getting better at it and yeah i mean (21:11 - 21:17)
III got most excited I was walking down (21:15 - 21:19)
Pennsylvania Avenue and there was an (21:17 - 21:22)
execute and I was able to catch that it (21:19 - 21:23)
was kind of in the middle of the road of (21:22 - 21:26)
pennsylvania avenue but still i was able (21:23 - 21:28)
to get it there seemed even on day one (21:26 - 21:31)
there seemed to be a lot of red team (21:28 - 21:34)
Jim's like already taken which I don't (21:31 - 21:36)
understand how that happened because I'm (21:34 - 21:39)
literally like within hours of of the (21:36 - 21:41)
game being launched there were a lot of (21:39 - 21:44)
red team gems and the gyms I've noticed (21:41 - 21:48)
are in you know DC while you don't know (21:44 - 21:51)
yet but DC has a lot of traffic circles (21:48 - 21:53)
those traffic circles have statues in (21:51 - 21:55)
them so they're in those kinds of spaces (21:53 - 21:59)
and then I noticed the fannie mae (21:55 - 22:03)
headquarters is a gym and my gym where I (21:59 - 22:06)
exercise is a gym which I that seemed (22:03 - 22:09)
really weird to me I have a funeral home (22:06 - 22:11)
near me that the gym at well like how (22:09 - 22:14)
did they pick those but then I look like (22:11 - 22:16)
an American University which is close by (22:14 - 22:19)
to my house relatively doesn't have like (22:16 - 22:24)
any gym on it so I ask away no idea and (22:19 - 22:26)
and I also have like the Sidwell Friends (22:24 - 22:28)
high school across the street from me (22:26 - 22:31)
and that's now I've given up people (22:28 - 22:33)
about people enough information are (22:31 - 22:36)
gonna by how you you could it (22:33 - 22:40)
could it could have been server issues (22:36 - 22:42)
cuz when i got to work and I loaded up I (22:40 - 22:45)
was like why is there no poki stuff and (22:42 - 22:47)
I I work not in the middle of nowhere (22:45 - 22:49)
but it's it's a very small city off off (22:47 - 22:51)
the highway oh no trust me it's the (22:49 - 22:53)
middle of nowhere I seen you on find my (22:51 - 22:56)
friends and I was like why how is her no (22:53 - 22:58)
poki stops or gyms here when i got to (22:56 - 23:02)
work and then later that day when the (22:58 - 23:03)
servers actually came up and i refreshed (23:02 - 23:05)
they did fill in because there's a post (23:03 - 23:07)
office near me and that was a that was a (23:05 - 23:09)
pokey stop and there was actually a park (23:07 - 23:13)
and not a police station and one of (23:09 - 23:15)
those i can't remember which one was it (23:13 - 23:19)
was a gym and maybe maybe you're just (23:15 - 23:20)
having server issues at that time (23:19 - 23:23)
because most public buildings should be (23:20 - 23:25)
something whether it's like a post (23:23 - 23:27)
office or police station like they (23:25 - 23:29)
should be either a gym or a pokey stop (23:27 - 23:32)
and if it's like a statue or a monument (23:29 - 23:34)
those should also be pokey stops so I'm (23:32 - 23:38)
also like confused and somebody can (23:34 - 23:40)
probably let us know on this one so (23:38 - 23:41)
there are a lot of statues in my (23:40 - 23:43)
neighborhood I live in a historic (23:41 - 23:45)
neighborhood and the statues that have (23:43 - 23:49)
been here since it before because it (23:45 - 23:51)
became historic how would you do I don't (23:49 - 23:53)
know whatever there's statues they're (23:51 - 23:56)
all over the place and all of them are (23:53 - 23:59)
pokey stops yes oh that's cool but (23:56 - 24:03)
somebody gave the statues names when (23:59 - 24:05)
they don't have (24:03 - 24:07)
official names they're all like mermaids (24:05 - 24:11)
and somebody like went through and gave (24:07 - 24:13)
them but who gave them names because one (24:11 - 24:15)
of them gave them a name with a question (24:13 - 24:17)
mark because they didn't understand what (24:15 - 24:19)
the statue was supposed to be I don't (24:17 - 24:21)
know where that's coming from because (24:19 - 24:23)
that's all pulling from like a Google (24:21 - 24:26)
database cuz but who went on Google and (24:23 - 24:28)
said I can't tell if this is a statue of (24:26 - 24:30)
a mermaid or the Statue of Liberty ah (24:28 - 24:32)
doesn't look like the Statue of Liberty (24:30 - 24:35)
frere are certain levels of like Google (24:32 - 24:37)
permission where you can like edit and (24:35 - 24:40)
help maps like in ways which is owned by (24:37 - 24:42)
Google that you can be like certain (24:40 - 24:46)
editor levels so you can like layout (24:42 - 24:48)
that like this is the City of Milwaukee (24:46 - 24:50)
but this is milwaukee county and then (24:48 - 24:52)
this is the city of New Berlin like you (24:50 - 24:55)
can map that on Google of maps and like (24:52 - 24:57)
update it for ways or other apps so I'm (24:55 - 24:59)
assuming at some point somebody was (24:57 - 25:01)
going through and like naming them (24:59 - 25:03)
because they had like they had developer (25:01 - 25:06)
access or not developer access but map (25:03 - 25:09)
creation access no one ever went and (25:06 - 25:11)
updated it I'm also assuming that it's (25:09 - 25:13)
pulling the same exact and a lot of data (25:11 - 25:16)
that ingress already laid for I don't (25:13 - 25:17)
know if a lot of people know this but (25:16 - 25:22)
when ingress was made it was it was one (25:17 - 25:24)
of the reasons it got made and one of (25:22 - 25:27)
the reasons behind it was to help map (25:24 - 25:30)
like parks and in other places that cars (25:27 - 25:33)
couldn't go and it says that in the (25:30 - 25:35)
terms and conditions when you sign up it (25:33 - 25:37)
says that it will use your data to make (25:35 - 25:41)
to like flesh out maps more that we're (25:37 - 25:43)
obviously you can't take a Google car (25:41 - 25:45)
through Central Park so you need (25:43 - 25:46)
somebody to walk through Central Park (25:45 - 25:48)
and grab those data points all right so (25:46 - 25:50)
speaking of parks that's another weird (25:48 - 25:52)
thing which is probably coming from the (25:50 - 25:54)
same source and along those lines but it (25:52 - 25:58)
was like really funny to me so I live (25:54 - 26:01)
inside of a national park so like around (25:58 - 26:05)
the edges of where I live it's basically (26:01 - 26:08)
the difference between washington DC (26:05 - 26:10)
owned land and federal government owned (26:08 - 26:15)
land so about every I'd say 20 or 30 (26:10 - 26:17)
feet on that border there's (26:15 - 26:20)
a metal stick in the ground that says a (26:17 - 26:24)
u.s. national territory just so that you (26:20 - 26:27)
know like if you cross this line the DC (26:24 - 26:29)
laws don't apply anymore it's federal (26:27 - 26:31)
laws whatever to keep it whether it's (26:29 - 26:33)
it's the most idiotic thing but somebody (26:31 - 26:34)
turned one of those sticks into app okay (26:33 - 26:39)
stop haha oh it's literally a metal (26:34 - 26:42)
stick in the ground and then they called (26:39 - 26:44)
the pokey stop like national park (26:42 - 26:47)
boundary and like but the whole edge of (26:44 - 26:49)
our neighborhood is our national park (26:47 - 26:51)
boundary obviously we have assuming all (26:49 - 26:54)
those pokey stop points are just points (26:51 - 26:56)
pulled from ingress all right i mean i (26:54 - 26:59)
guess so you ingress folks have some (26:56 - 27:04)
weird cuz i mean we could then have like (26:59 - 27:06)
maybe like 100 puppy stops of each stick (27:04 - 27:09)
was a poke a stop one yeah yeah I always (27:06 - 27:12)
had the the understanding that sometimes (27:09 - 27:15)
people playing ingress they would do (27:12 - 27:17)
things that would break the law whether (27:15 - 27:20)
that's trespassing or you know just (27:17 - 27:23)
stuff like that nothing serious but you (27:20 - 27:26)
know you shouldn't be at a in a park at (27:23 - 27:28)
two in the morning because technically (27:26 - 27:30)
the park is closed in the park is owned (27:28 - 27:32)
by the city and the city put out you (27:30 - 27:35)
know what I mean yeah park closes that (27:32 - 27:37)
dark means park closes at dark do you (27:35 - 27:39)
guys if it's dark out you don't go in (27:37 - 27:42)
there so you know stuff like that so I'm (27:39 - 27:47)
walking around my my neighborhood and (27:42 - 27:50)
you see the grass rustling and like a (27:47 - 27:52)
lot of it is in people's backyards and (27:50 - 27:56)
I'm thinking I'm not know part of me is (27:52 - 27:58)
going to go in somebody's backyard to (27:56 - 28:01)
catch a pokemon or capture a point or (27:58 - 28:04)
whatever but then I'm like this is this (28:01 - 28:05)
is what happened with ingress like (28:04 - 28:09)
people did this and and that trespassing (28:05 - 28:12)
no absolutely I actually found that I (28:09 - 28:15)
don't have to be that close to a Pokemon (28:12 - 28:17)
for it to appear on my screen that you (28:15 - 28:19)
know you can be pretty far from it and (28:17 - 28:21)
as long as you can see the actual (28:19 - 28:23)
pokemon then just touch it and then it's (28:21 - 28:26)
like becomes captura below have to get (28:23 - 28:30)
that up close yeah arsenal for like 40 (28:26 - 28:31)
pokies (28:30 - 28:34)
or polka Jim you have to be close enough (28:31 - 28:37)
for it in it the the animation of that (28:34 - 28:38)
icon on the map will change when you're (28:37 - 28:42)
close enough and for a Pokemon when it (28:38 - 28:44)
pops up as long as you see it on the map (28:42 - 28:46)
you tap it and you go into the catch (28:44 - 28:48)
mode janna kats your screen at that (28:46 - 28:50)
point if you're in catch mode you could (28:48 - 28:52)
go like a mile down the road and you're (28:50 - 28:56)
still in that capture mode where a pokey (28:52 - 28:57)
gym or pokey stop you have to be there (28:56 - 29:00)
for it to register and authenticate to (28:57 - 29:03)
give you your rewards or to do the (29:00 - 29:06)
battle I was a bit surprised on how (29:03 - 29:09)
close you had to be because there's a (29:06 - 29:11)
there's a bar down the street from me (29:09 - 29:13)
literally across the street so like (29:11 - 29:15)
three houses down and then you cross the (29:13 - 29:17)
street and it's right there and that's (29:15 - 29:19)
the nearest pokey stop i have and i (29:17 - 29:21)
couldn't check in on my couch and I was (29:19 - 29:22)
like really how close do you have to be (29:21 - 29:24)
so I walked I walked down the street and (29:22 - 29:26)
I was like okay I'm across the street (29:24 - 29:27)
from it oh I guess I'm not close enough (29:26 - 29:30)
and as soon as I like took like three or (29:27 - 29:32)
four steps into the road obviously one (29:30 - 29:34)
when the walk sign was on when when it (29:32 - 29:37)
was my turn to walk I was I was then (29:34 - 29:39)
close enough but I was I was a little (29:37 - 29:42)
like surprised like okay it this is the (29:39 - 29:45)
closest one to me but it kind of it it's (29:42 - 29:46)
not like I could just check in at my (29:45 - 29:48)
house every five minutes because the (29:46 - 29:49)
pokey stop refreshes in five to ten (29:48 - 29:52)
minutes yeah they turned like purple (29:49 - 29:54)
purple lady yeah they're blue when (29:52 - 29:55)
they're good and then they turned purple (29:54 - 29:57)
when they are inactive and then if (29:55 - 30:01)
somebody puts one of those lures on it (29:57 - 30:03)
it will start like making glitter come (30:01 - 30:05)
out of it like this pink glitter wait so (30:03 - 30:07)
I have a question for you because I (30:05 - 30:10)
missed this one of your mini episodes if (30:07 - 30:14)
the Pokemon doesn't have a green ring on (30:10 - 30:15)
it but it has a different color ring on (30:14 - 30:18)
it how do you make it green because i (30:15 - 30:20)
had a pidgeot like while i was walking (30:18 - 30:22)
iris and i couldn't catch it because i (30:20 - 30:23)
couldn't get thing to change the color (30:22 - 30:26)
uh you cuz i haven't seen any red so (30:23 - 30:29)
it's green yellow red for do this one (30:26 - 30:31)
had a yellow I had a yellow pit (30:29 - 30:33)
pidgeotto I think and it took just three (30:31 - 30:36)
or four balls do capture it pokeballs (30:33 - 30:38)
you just gonna have to wait till the (30:36 - 30:41)
circle gets like the smallest point what (30:38 - 30:43)
you can't change the color to green I (30:41 - 30:45)
think there's a way but I haven't gotten (30:43 - 30:45)
to (30:45 - 30:47)
that point i right I believe there are (30:45 - 30:50)
like berries you can throw or like feed (30:47 - 30:53)
them to calm them for that but I was (30:50 - 30:55)
able to capture a couple yellows (30:53 - 30:58)
yesterday I used my pokemon trainer club (30:55 - 31:01)
account to set up Pokemon go because (30:58 - 31:04)
what I was thinking is well my play (31:01 - 31:07)
pokemon stuff is tied to this and pay (31:04 - 31:08)
for everything else Pokemon related is (31:07 - 31:10)
tied to this this would be this would (31:08 - 31:13)
make the most sense and I played pokemon (31:10 - 31:15)
go for about 10-15 minutes on my couch (31:13 - 31:17)
and then the servers went down for me (31:15 - 31:20)
this was when it launched on Thursday (31:17 - 31:23)
night and first it went out on my iPad (31:20 - 31:25)
then it went out on my iPhone and I (31:23 - 31:28)
thought maybe it was an iPad issue or (31:25 - 31:31)
the servers went down they came back up (31:28 - 31:34)
for me around one a.m. friday morning so (31:31 - 31:37)
about six hours after the game came out (31:34 - 31:40)
i played for a little bit went to bed (31:37 - 31:44)
they were out ever since finally the (31:40 - 31:48)
pokemon trainer club servers came back (31:44 - 31:50)
up last night (31:48 - 31:53)
around 11pm if i'm not mistaken because (31:50 - 31:56)
i saw a bunch of tweets about it so that (31:53 - 31:57)
was the first time in almost two days i (31:56 - 32:00)
was able to log in my pokemon trainer (31:57 - 32:03)
club account in the meantime i made a (32:00 - 32:07)
google account to just capture data and (32:03 - 32:09)
get some stuff but i already put right (32:07 - 32:10)
when i got the game i put ten dollars (32:09 - 32:12)
into it because I wanted to I wanted to (32:10 - 32:14)
buy stuff so I could properly report on (32:12 - 32:17)
it as of this recording I think I think (32:14 - 32:18)
everything is down the servers have (32:17 - 32:22)
gotten better but did you use your (32:18 - 32:23)
trainer club or did you use just a gmail (32:22 - 32:26)
yeah no I use my trainer club okay and (32:23 - 32:28)
it's sort of the same reason as you (32:26 - 32:31)
right I want it to be tied my whole (32:28 - 32:35)
Pokemon experience like even my TCG play (32:31 - 32:36)
points and everything that's part of my (32:35 - 32:39)
trainer club account my VGC competent (32:36 - 32:41)
competitive stuff is in there so I want (32:39 - 32:43)
everything in my Pokemon life to be (32:41 - 32:46)
around my trainer club account not my (32:43 - 32:49)
google stuff which i barely use right (32:46 - 32:52)
yeah so it seemed between the time that (32:49 - 32:54)
pokemon trainer club trainer club (32:52 - 32:57)
accounts were down gmail the google (32:54 - 32:59)
accounts were working on and off more (32:57 - 33:02)
reliable while the ten times more (32:59 - 33:03)
reliable than the trainer club because (33:02 - 33:06)
it was down for almost 48 hours but it's (33:03 - 33:08)
interesting that there are dedicated (33:06 - 33:09)
servers to that and then there's (33:08 - 33:12)
dedicated servers to the google stuff (33:09 - 33:15)
well now it's it's the authentication (33:12 - 33:17)
methodology right because the pokemon (33:15 - 33:19)
trainer club accounts have to be (33:17 - 33:25)
authenticated by TPC I servers and and (33:19 - 33:28)
those are distinctly separate from (33:25 - 33:30)
Google authentication there a Google (33:28 - 33:31)
authentication is going to work (33:30 - 33:33)
ninety-nine percent of the time because (33:31 - 33:34)
they're authenticating email and (33:33 - 33:38)
everything all the time but it's it's (33:34 - 33:40)
really it's it's two separate sets of (33:38 - 33:41)
servers it's not going to the same place (33:40 - 33:45)
to authenticate so I mean if it was (33:41 - 33:46)
going to the same place to authenticate (33:45 - 33:48)
there be you wouldn't have to select (33:46 - 33:49)
from two different buttons when you were (33:48 - 33:51)
selecting to set up your account and (33:49 - 33:55)
everything like that um but yeah it's (33:51 - 33:58)
just I think that I think that they made (33:55 - 33:59)
two mistakes and this is completely (33:58 - 34:02)
assumption on my part there's no no fact (33:59 - 34:04)
in this or you know a no sign (34:02 - 34:06)
research in this but I think number one (34:04 - 34:09)
they were surprised at how many people (34:06 - 34:12)
wanted to play when the game was (34:09 - 34:15)
released in the first case but the real (34:12 - 34:18)
thing that they did not think through (34:15 - 34:21)
would be was the number of people who do (34:18 - 34:25)
not want to use a google account for (34:21 - 34:28)
anything at all and especially for (34:25 - 34:31)
Pokemon go so right the one of the main (34:28 - 34:33)
problems they've had is people haven't (34:31 - 34:36)
even been able to sign up for new player (34:33 - 34:39)
commodity outs because that whole system (34:36 - 34:41)
is so overloaded and the reason for that (34:39 - 34:43)
people don't want to set up google (34:41 - 34:44)
accounts people don't trust Google they (34:43 - 34:46)
think it's stealing their data and its (34:44 - 34:49)
sky any tickets stealing the antics (34:46 - 34:51)
taking your data from Pokemon go and (34:49 - 34:53)
sending it to Google well I know I mean (34:51 - 34:54)
but this is something I actually had to (34:53 - 34:56)
deal with at my job because we use (34:54 - 34:58)
Google services for a lot of stuff and (34:56 - 35:01)
there's really i would not i'm not gonna (34:58 - 35:05)
say unfounded but over sensitive / (35:01 - 35:09)
concern about what Google is doing with (35:05 - 35:12)
your data and I mean I could talk for an (35:09 - 35:14)
hour about the concept of privacy and (35:12 - 35:17)
what people actually believe is being (35:14 - 35:18)
done when they say that a company has (35:17 - 35:20)
access to your data versus what actually (35:18 - 35:23)
happens in reality but people just have (35:20 - 35:27)
this like unreal fear of Google so (35:23 - 35:29)
they're like well there's no way I'm (35:27 - 35:31)
going to use a Google account to sign up (35:29 - 35:33)
for this especially since it's about me (35:31 - 35:34)
walking around and it's got to know (35:33 - 35:36)
where I am on earth and then Skynet's (35:34 - 35:41)
going to send the Terminator after me so (35:36 - 35:43)
you know I'm only going to do this with (35:41 - 35:45)
a pokemon trainer Club a cow and then (35:43 - 35:47)
that's that's overwhelming Pokemon (35:45 - 35:49)
because they were like they were really (35:47 - 35:51)
thinking it's just going to be a very (35:49 - 35:52)
little overflow from the number of (35:51 - 35:55)
people who already have pokemon trainer (35:52 - 35:57)
Club accounts as opposed to a migration (35:55 - 35:59)
away from google into pokemon trainer (35:57 - 36:01)
club does that make any sense and I go (35:59 - 36:03)
yeah no I followed like words here okay (36:01 - 36:07)
yeah I followed you I (36:03 - 36:10)
when the trainer club account came back (36:07 - 36:14)
up last night at eleven I was I was (36:10 - 36:16)
finishing recording the third episode of (36:14 - 36:18)
The Journal report that I've been (36:16 - 36:22)
putting out for Pokemon go and going (36:18 - 36:24)
with my plan of resetting my sleep (36:22 - 36:27)
schedule for this trip I was taking I (36:24 - 36:30)
finally logged in probably 1 30am (36:27 - 36:33)
verified that it was working to cool my (36:30 - 36:35)
pokemon here that I caught on the first (36:33 - 36:39)
day my money is still here that I put (36:35 - 36:42)
into it so I was like okay well you know (36:39 - 36:43)
what I'll just walk to the pokey stop (36:42 - 36:46)
the bar down the street cuz it's 2am so (36:43 - 36:48)
it's still open not that I was going to (36:46 - 36:51)
go inside but you know I I guess I (36:48 - 36:53)
didn't want to be like the weird guy at (36:51 - 36:55)
like 3am walking looking like I'm (36:53 - 36:59)
walking to a closed bar I guess bars in (36:55 - 37:02)
Wisconsin by the way closed at two I too (36:59 - 37:04)
am so I walked over there checked in (37:02 - 37:07)
walked back caught a couple Pokemon and (37:04 - 37:11)
then at that point I hey what am I good (37:07 - 37:12)
at like how am I gonna stay awake and (37:11 - 37:15)
that and I decided I'm just gonna I'm (37:12 - 37:17)
just gonna drive to places where there (37:15 - 37:19)
will probably be pokey stops and pokey (37:17 - 37:22)
gyms and I will drive there i will park (37:19 - 37:24)
my car will get out i will do some stuff (37:22 - 37:27)
i'll get my car continued driving well (37:24 - 37:28)
that's how I ended up doing for two (37:27 - 37:32)
hours wait in Milwaukee yeah um well gee (37:28 - 37:36)
how dangerous that is I went to the more (37:32 - 37:38)
suburbs not downtown Milwaukee I was (37:36 - 37:40)
like more like Brookfield yeah yeah (37:38 - 37:43)
alright like watch oh send stuff so I (37:40 - 37:46)
love Wauwatosa so there there's a (37:43 - 37:49)
there's a target near me and it takes me (37:46 - 37:52)
exactly about 8 to 10 minutes to get to (37:49 - 37:55)
target from my house in a car I ended up (37:52 - 37:58)
taking an hour to get to that target (37:55 - 38:00)
because I pulled over so many times on (37:58 - 38:04)
the side of the road to as it I do not (38:00 - 38:07)
encourage or I do not want to hear about (38:04 - 38:09)
anyone playing pokemon go or driving I'm (38:07 - 38:13)
not I am I'm the friend in a car where (38:09 - 38:15)
if somebody is driving and they pull out (38:13 - 38:17)
their phone I'm like no you put that (38:15 - 38:20)
phone away hey the car is a no phone (38:17 - 38:23)
zone no phone zone because I'm a (38:20 - 38:25)
passenger in this car and I don't feel (38:23 - 38:27)
like dying today if you want to be on (38:25 - 38:28)
your phone the entire time I am more (38:27 - 38:32)
than happy to drive but no driving and (38:28 - 38:34)
texting when I'm in your car what you do (38:32 - 38:36)
on your own time is fine but I don't (38:34 - 38:38)
know yeah I'm just texting and driving (38:36 - 38:42)
not cool what I did last night is I (38:38 - 38:45)
looked at my phone I said this is the (38:42 - 38:47)
nearest pokey stop it was almost always (38:45 - 38:49)
like a church or a public building I'm (38:47 - 38:51)
going to drive directly to that pokey (38:49 - 38:54)
stop and as soon as I got there I would (38:51 - 38:56)
park I would keep my car running I would (38:54 - 38:59)
check in catch like two or three pokemon (38:56 - 39:01)
in the area I would then look for the (38:59 - 39:04)
next pokey stop in my in my map area I (39:01 - 39:07)
would drive to that I would park do the (39:04 - 39:08)
same thing and that's why I took me an (39:07 - 39:10)
hour to drive what was normally eight (39:08 - 39:13)
minutes down the road and it worked (39:10 - 39:16)
really well although like I guess I (39:13 - 39:18)
would rather like go to a busier place (39:16 - 39:20)
and just get out and walk around but I (39:18 - 39:22)
didn't really want to walk around like (39:20 - 39:25)
city blocks at three in the morning so (39:22 - 39:27)
that I just kind of stood in my car but (39:25 - 39:29)
I I ended up going out for two hours (39:27 - 39:30)
because I wanted to gather as much data (39:29 - 39:33)
and at that point I didn't sign up i (39:30 - 39:38)
joined the blue team battled at a gym a (39:33 - 39:40)
couple times i evolved the pokemon i did (39:38 - 39:43)
as much as I could in two hours and I (39:40 - 39:45)
actually started the night with 55 (39:43 - 39:48)
pokeballs I caught about 60 different (39:45 - 39:50)
pokemon in two hours and then I ended (39:48 - 39:53)
the night with 67 pokeballs just because (39:50 - 39:55)
of how many pokey stops I stopped at I (39:53 - 39:58)
wanted as much data as I could to report (39:55 - 39:59)
on it properly because it was I was (39:58 - 40:01)
running out of things to say because I (39:59 - 40:02)
couldn't log into my trainer club and (40:01 - 40:04)
that was the one I actually wanted to (40:02 - 40:06)
advance and you're actually a very (40:04 - 40:08)
creepy person who likes to hang out (40:06 - 40:10)
around funeral homes it was the first (40:08 - 40:13)
gym near me yeah you're a lost little (40:10 - 40:15)
guy it was a gym and a pokey step (40:13 - 40:18)
because I think they considered the (40:15 - 40:20)
statue outside of the funeral home the (40:18 - 40:21)
pokey stop and then the funeral home (40:20 - 40:24)
itself was the gym was there like a (40:21 - 40:26)
ghastly protecting it or a Grimer or (40:24 - 40:29)
what was over there ah (40:26 - 40:32)
again dar think that's where I found an (40:29 - 40:36)
execute yes I haven't found any like (40:32 - 40:39)
rare or unique Pokemon in my area like I (40:36 - 40:42)
have a pijat now that I caught like two (40:39 - 40:44)
or three pidgeotto zand I eventually (40:42 - 40:45)
evolved one of them because I had enough (40:44 - 40:49)
Pidgey candy I kept catching wheedles I (40:45 - 40:52)
evolved it enough to get a Beedrill a (40:49 - 40:55)
lot of paris's yeah there was a Paris (40:52 - 40:57)
right by my house I have found one magic (40:55 - 41:02)
carp so nothing 100 more to go ya know (40:57 - 41:04)
like guess (41:02 - 41:07)
I saw hunt a hunter silhouette on my map (41:04 - 41:10)
but I never found it there's jinx in my (41:07 - 41:12)
area I don't know if you have any chinks (41:10 - 41:14)
in your area I have not seen one mostly (41:12 - 41:19)
ratata mostly I didn't get an Eevee that (41:14 - 41:24)
executes was downtown and then like a (41:19 - 41:27)
piggies yeah nothing but but I'm very (41:24 - 41:29)
low level still I'm not even level five (41:27 - 41:31)
yet so yeah when you get higher up (41:29 - 41:34)
levels you start seeing more put more (41:31 - 41:37)
pokemon with higher combat points yeah (41:34 - 41:42)
yeah that's how I points so yeah um that (41:37 - 41:43)
was that was my night I ended it by (41:42 - 41:45)
going to mcdonalds getting breakfast and (41:43 - 41:48)
then going to bed the article I wanted (41:45 - 41:52)
to talk about here is titled Pokemon go (41:48 - 41:54)
isn't very good but it will be a huge (41:52 - 41:57)
but it will be huge anyways by Austin (41:54 - 41:59)
Walker who is formerly of giant bomb he (41:57 - 42:02)
now works for Vice gaming I'll read a (41:59 - 42:05)
little bit here from the article made by (42:02 - 42:06)
neon taking the pokemon company which is (42:05 - 42:08)
partially owned by nintendo pokemon go (42:06 - 42:10)
simplifies the complex rules of the (42:08 - 42:12)
traditional pokemon series and instead (42:10 - 42:15)
of emphasizing and instead emphasizes (42:12 - 42:17)
exploring your real-life surroundings as (42:15 - 42:19)
you wander around you'll find various (42:17 - 42:21)
pokemon in the world tap on them then (42:19 - 42:22)
you use a simple touch interface will (42:21 - 42:24)
throw a Pokeball at them if you toss it (42:22 - 42:26)
right you manage to any manages to stay (42:24 - 42:28)
connected the server it will add to your (42:26 - 42:31)
collection unfortunately my entire first (42:28 - 42:32)
day with pokemon go was dominated by (42:31 - 42:34)
technical issues the game locks up (42:32 - 42:36)
struggles to connect or stay connected (42:34 - 42:39)
to the servers the GPS fails to (42:36 - 42:40)
automatically update items will vanish (42:39 - 42:42)
or fail as they work it will crash again (42:40 - 42:45)
it's a mess wheres pokemon go might not (42:42 - 42:47)
even be that good of a game without the (42:45 - 42:49)
technical problems as in ingress neon (42:47 - 42:51)
takes previous GPS driven game pokemon (42:49 - 42:54)
go uses local landmarks like murals (42:51 - 42:55)
churches monuments and ingame (42:54 - 42:58)
destination as in game destinations some (42:55 - 42:59)
of these destinations give you items (42:58 - 43:01)
more pokeballs healing items for your (42:59 - 43:03)
Pokemon etc and other gyms where you can (43:01 - 43:07)
battle with rival players every player (43:03 - 43:08)
aligns themselves to one of three teams (43:07 - 43:10)
each trying to take over Jim's while (43:08 - 43:12)
building up their own defenses the early (43:10 - 43:14)
game is more about walking around (43:12 - 43:15)
stumbling into new Pokemon building your (43:14 - 43:18)
collection and it seems be a long term (43:15 - 43:20)
focus and it seems the long-term focus (43:18 - 43:23)
of Pokemon go will be gym battles the (43:20 - 43:25)
battles the bad news is the battles are (43:23 - 43:27)
pretty disappointing imagine a really (43:25 - 43:29)
impress I hunch out or infinity blade (43:27 - 43:31)
you swipe left or right to dodge (43:29 - 43:34)
incoming attacks tap to fire your own or (43:31 - 43:35)
hold down on the screen to launch a (43:34 - 43:37)
special attack I actually didn't know (43:35 - 43:39)
that until I read this article Pokemon (43:37 - 43:41)
does eight does include a familiar (43:39 - 43:43)
elemental resistance system but all the (43:41 - 43:45)
fights I have been in haven't benefited (43:43 - 43:48)
from it it never feels like more than (43:45 - 43:51)
wild get gesturing and hoping that the (43:48 - 43:52)
commands I actually enter sent through (43:51 - 43:54)
to the server all of this leads to a (43:52 - 43:57)
stuttering rhythm of play that goes (43:54 - 43:58)
against everything that made Pokemon so (43:57 - 44:00)
great over the year a good pokemon game (43:58 - 44:03)
entices you to stay awake in bed just so (44:00 - 44:05)
you can get a taste of what the next (44:03 - 44:06)
area holds you slide efforts (44:05 - 44:08)
effortlessly from one battle to another (44:06 - 44:11)
trying out new Pokemon and formulating (44:08 - 44:14)
strategic plans tension peaks at key (44:11 - 44:16)
battles and then smooth out once you're (44:14 - 44:17)
through it Pokemon go doesn't have any (44:16 - 44:20)
flow instead it moves fits in and starts (44:17 - 44:25)
that match it's choppy instead it moves (44:20 - 44:27)
in fits and starts that match it's (44:25 - 44:30)
choppy interface and then it kind of (44:27 - 44:33)
goes on saying how he met up with some (44:30 - 44:34)
people playing pokemon go they were (44:33 - 44:37)
really excited they said they never (44:34 - 44:39)
played a game like this they liked that (44:37 - 44:40)
they got to hang out together and go to (44:39 - 44:42)
weird places they liked that it was (44:40 - 44:45)
Pokemon and they didn't mind the (44:42 - 44:46)
crashing or the poor mechanics or the (44:45 - 44:49)
lackluster battles so I guess his (44:46 - 44:51)
argument would be that Pokemon go has a (44:49 - 44:56)
shelf life of about 1 me tomo ah i mean (44:51 - 44:58)
i agree with them in in a lot of aspects (44:56 - 45:02)
if you take away pokemon from pokemon go (44:58 - 45:04)
i don't think anyone would be playing it (45:02 - 45:08)
go you got that right and I and I think (45:04 - 45:12)
just that statement alone shows that the (45:08 - 45:15)
skeleton is just not very good for this (45:12 - 45:19)
game like Pokemon shuffle is still a (45:15 - 45:21)
good game even if it was not pokemon (45:19 - 45:23)
themed oh definitely true and a picnic (45:21 - 45:25)
Pokemon picross the same thing not (45:23 - 45:28)
Pokemon themed it's still a good game (45:25 - 45:30)
now I've enjoyed my time with Pokemon go (45:28 - 45:31)
and I'm very excited (45:30 - 45:36)
to play more of Pokemon go but I'm (45:31 - 45:39)
pretty excited to get the pokemon gold (45:36 - 45:44)
plus because I've caught probably 20 to (45:39 - 45:46)
30 wheedles and it's not that exciting (45:44 - 45:48)
to catch wheedles like I definitely got (45:46 - 45:50)
excited when I saw a magic card because (45:48 - 45:52)
it was my first magic harp the other (45:50 - 45:55)
thing I I strongly agree with is is the (45:52 - 45:58)
battling at a gym I you're supposed to (45:55 - 46:01)
swipe left or right to dodge and I (45:58 - 46:04)
probably encountered four or five gym (46:01 - 46:06)
battles last night even I went into them (46:04 - 46:08)
even knowing I would lose cuz I just (46:06 - 46:12)
wanted to make sure I was understanding (46:08 - 46:14)
the mechanics and so I could report on (46:12 - 46:18)
that and I felt like I couldn't ever not (46:14 - 46:21)
get away from their attacks like I (46:18 - 46:23)
stopped attacking and tried just to (46:21 - 46:24)
dodge and I felt like I was still (46:23 - 46:28)
getting hit by everything and then I was (46:24 - 46:29)
like well I'm just gonna just keep (46:28 - 46:30)
attacking because it looks like they (46:29 - 46:32)
just keep attacking and that also didn't (46:30 - 46:35)
work either it just feel it just feels (46:32 - 46:37)
like a hot mess and maybe I'm playing it (46:35 - 46:39)
wrong but I feel like I'm alright at (46:37 - 46:41)
video games I feel like I understand the (46:39 - 46:43)
swipe left to dodge swipe right to dodge (46:41 - 46:46)
tap to attack like those seem like very (46:43 - 46:50)
basic mechanics um and for me it just it (46:46 - 46:52)
just I could no battle I was in it ever (46:50 - 46:54)
felt good or fun it just felt (46:52 - 46:58)
frustrating and now yeah at least the (46:54 - 47:00)
one thing that we should always be sure (46:58 - 47:05)
to say is they that this isn't um it's (47:00 - 47:07)
not set in stone right they can make (47:05 - 47:10)
improvements over time right and (47:07 - 47:12)
actually one thing I was having an (47:10 - 47:14)
argument with somebody online about (47:12 - 47:18)
which turned out I was wrong the release (47:14 - 47:21)
version of pokemon go right now is not a (47:18 - 47:25)
one point 0 version it's a 0.29 version (47:21 - 47:29)
yeah yeah technically it's not even like (47:25 - 47:31)
you know if you're looking at versioning (47:29 - 47:35)
numbers it's not at a a final version (47:31 - 47:38)
state in terms which surprises me cuz I (47:35 - 47:40)
thought apple was pretty strict about (47:38 - 47:42)
not allowing betas in the app store yeah (47:40 - 47:45)
I'm not sure I'm also not sure (47:42 - 47:48)
about the longevity of the game and I (47:45 - 47:50)
guess I would have to look more closely (47:48 - 47:54)
at ingress but I think one of the the (47:50 - 47:58)
pictures going around was there is a pit (47:54 - 48:01)
jot at the White House because the White (47:58 - 48:04)
House is a pokey gym and the pit jots (48:01 - 48:07)
name I think is America yo which is (48:04 - 48:10)
really funny right super funny that pit (48:07 - 48:13)
job from the picture and I could be (48:10 - 48:15)
wrong so this is just a general let's (48:13 - 48:19)
just say it has 500 combat point I've (48:15 - 48:21)
seen pokemon with more than 500 combat (48:19 - 48:23)
points so they go there they beat it (48:21 - 48:25)
let's say that Pokemon that beats it has (48:23 - 48:28)
600 combat points and then somebody (48:25 - 48:30)
beats it with 700 combat points and then (48:28 - 48:34)
ate like at what point does it does it (48:30 - 48:39)
just come down to people trading like is (48:34 - 48:42)
there a combat point cap ah yeah and (48:39 - 48:44)
then when does it become to your to come (48:42 - 48:46)
down to your skill at battling right and (48:44 - 48:49)
if there is a cap at how does that apply (48:46 - 48:51)
to new players if every pokey gym is (48:49 - 48:54)
capped at a thousand championship points (48:51 - 48:56)
and every gym has three pokemon out a (48:54 - 48:58)
thousand champion or combat points sorry (48:56 - 49:03)
and you have six pokemon with a thousand (48:58 - 49:05)
combat points like how does that all (49:03 - 49:07)
play out or is it never ending is that (49:05 - 49:09)
value getting higher and higher like I'm (49:07 - 49:12)
assuming there's a cap at some point and (49:09 - 49:17)
where I don't know I don't know I am I (49:12 - 49:19)
had to do with teams it might the team (49:17 - 49:22)
building stuff might come in on that so (49:19 - 49:23)
like if you're a lower level player you (49:22 - 49:25)
can contribute your pokemon to would (49:23 - 49:28)
like be stay at the gym as part of your (49:25 - 49:31)
team without having to be a high level (49:28 - 49:33)
pokemon and maybe it levels up or (49:31 - 49:36)
something I do I really don't know the (49:33 - 49:37)
mechanics at all cuz I haven't been able (49:36 - 49:42)
to join a team yeah so I will be very (49:37 - 49:44)
curious of the longevity of the game (49:42 - 49:47)
while I do agree with a lot of Austin (49:44 - 49:50)
Walker's article about how the battling (49:47 - 49:52)
is disappointing the caching is a (49:50 - 49:56)
lackluster and if you take away the (49:52 - 49:58)
Pokemon skin this is probably not a game (49:56 - 49:59)
that people would be download (49:58 - 50:01)
it would probably not be a number one (49:59 - 50:04)
game in the itunes store with all those (50:01 - 50:07)
complaints i am still having a fantastic (50:04 - 50:10)
time with pokemon go when it's working (50:07 - 50:13)
yeah and I'm so really excited to play (50:10 - 50:15)
it so don't don't make that seem like (50:13 - 50:16)
we're really negative we're just being (50:15 - 50:19)
critical and we're just pointing out (50:16 - 50:21)
stuff because we want to see Pokemon go (50:19 - 50:23)
get better that's all those complaints (50:21 - 50:25)
are coming from they're coming from the (50:23 - 50:29)
the reasoning and the the motive of (50:25 - 50:31)
wanting this game to get better because (50:29 - 50:34)
we like it so far we can just see (50:31 - 50:36)
improvements in the future making it (50:34 - 50:38)
more enjoyable yeah can I can i submit (50:36 - 50:41)
my request for improvement to the (50:38 - 50:44)
Niantic company right now the one thing (50:41 - 50:46)
that I would like to see improved I (50:44 - 50:50)
let's hear it so when you're on the (50:46 - 50:53)
walking around map screen and if you set (50:50 - 50:56)
the map to like where the map moves (50:53 - 51:01)
around versus the York character moving (50:56 - 51:02)
around you know what I'm saying like the (51:01 - 51:06)
orientation and stuff so like it it auto (51:02 - 51:09)
Orient's where its showing mostly what's (51:06 - 51:11)
behind you when you're walking versus (51:09 - 51:14)
where what you're heading towards oh and (51:11 - 51:16)
I just want them to flip that I know you (51:14 - 51:18)
can manually like put your finger on it (51:16 - 51:21)
and rewrote it a map to to where you're (51:18 - 51:24)
walking but I kind of wanted to auto do (51:21 - 51:26)
that and be more focused on what I'm (51:24 - 51:28)
walking towards versus what I'm walking (51:26 - 51:31)
away from my one request I think besides (51:28 - 51:34)
them prioritizing fixing servers which (51:31 - 51:36)
is the most important thing to do don't (51:34 - 51:38)
get me wrong i think they said that (51:36 - 51:41)
trading was like the thing coming next (51:38 - 51:46)
to the game and then map fixing I don't (51:41 - 51:50)
know so so yeah I think that that kind (51:46 - 51:51)
of wraps it up those are our thoughts on (51:50 - 51:57)
Pokemon go no Travis they are still (51:51 - 51:58)
either (51:57 - 52:02)
out of country or no I think they said (51:58 - 52:06)
they are at their parents yes and also (52:02 - 52:10)
Travis does not use smart mobile devices (52:06 - 52:12)
so Travis will never have an opinion (52:10 - 52:14)
about Pokemon all right yeah they won't (52:12 - 52:16)
have an opinion on Pokemon go because (52:14 - 52:20)
they have a phone from 2006 it's a (52:16 - 52:22)
feature phone that's all you have to say (52:20 - 52:26)
with that being said we're gonna not do (52:22 - 52:27)
pokemon of the week just because we (52:26 - 52:30)
don't have a move set and I have way too (52:27 - 52:31)
much stuff to do before I get on a (52:30 - 52:33)
flight in less than (52:31 - 52:36)
13 hours here so I want to get this cut (52:33 - 52:37)
and edit it and get it out for you guys (52:36 - 52:40)
I'm very excited for the next episode if (52:37 - 52:41)
everything goes smoothly from where my (52:40 - 52:43)
flights taking me we'll have a really (52:41 - 52:45)
cool guest on I don't want to say who (52:43 - 52:47)
that is or get anyone hype because if (52:45 - 52:49)
something falls through I don't want to (52:47 - 52:51)
be held to like well you said hopefully (52:49 - 52:54)
everything works out hopefully Pokemon (52:51 - 52:56)
go continues working throughout the (52:54 - 53:00)
