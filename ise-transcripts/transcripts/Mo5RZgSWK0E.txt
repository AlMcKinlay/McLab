[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 475th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj hello we got a lot to talk about today do we do something great look i'm not sugarcoating this podcast we're not debating with i don't want any minnesota weather greg's here will's here but are we debating what you are cutting out the thing that people actually listen to the show for the first 10 minutes because back to the boring stuff you know when we're talking about interesting things like our lives like the fact that i went to a wedding yesterday that you'd even ask about you don't even care how brief who's getting married in the summer we're all about fall weddings here uh my friends did and it was lovely and it was a cool day yesterday you didn't even have a full wedding what are you talking about yeah you had a winter wedding yeah the winterist of winter weddings that is the commotion because it sleeted and it was awful that was good the weather was terrible the day the night was good but the weather was bad look no one was going anywhere you got your destination you were stuck there it was a destination wedding that destination being the hotel and you didn't leave it to prevent this from being a 23-hour program one hour per one minute of this uh we're gonna talk about the presents not to be confused with the direct although i don't know if anyone could name the difference between the two and i guess we'll go in order and uh yeah oh for how it started i believe it's it started with pokemon unite oh yeah you are correct greg how many times did you watch it once d minus d minus student is i supposed to study it yes why because you have to catch those like super minute details like mama swine's coming to united and i'm saving up all my coins and not no i'm not buying blastoise i'm saving my money for my wish list that came true the thing i asked what are the things i asked for was sylveon was mammoth all right we'll start with the pokemon unite i have the press release here if you missed the presents um obviously i don't i i find it very hard to believe somebody would listen to this program and not watch it but people are busy i don't know it was 28 minutes pokemon unite is available for download on mobile devices on september 22nd so we got a date for that uh in this title in this title that released on the nintendo switch this last month players will face off against each other on five or five team battles in which they cooperate debatable with teammates to defeat wild pokemon as well as level up their own pokemon to defeat the opposing team in anticipation of the launch on mobile version pre-registration has now begun on the app store and the google play store i don't i haven't done that actually i forgot about that i did i don't even understand what that means registering for what it's just like because they both have where you can like download the app early we'll not download but say you're interested in the app um if pre-registrations press releases anyways totals reaches 2.5 million players uh players will receive the unite license for pikachu i'm assuming if you already have pikachu you get coins kind of like how the thingy with the other thing worked if the total hits million players you will also get a special hollow wear festive style pikachu style if and when those thresholds are reached players can claim the pikachu unite license and the hollower by logging onto the mobile version and completing the log in event by october 31st so not only do you not get it right away you have to do an event you're just unlocking the the event that you have to then do to get it pokemon unite players can also log in the nintendo switch version of the game right now to receive the unite license for zera aura if players link the same account to both the nintendo switch and the mobile version they will be able to use their aura in the mobile version when it launches too trainers can look forward to mamo swine and sylveon coming soon as the next playable pokemon to join in the fray when they say next playable pokemon are they are we just still continuing to skip last one we're skipping blast lights blastoise doesn't work they know it doesn't work and they have to fix it it'll ruin the beta yeah i'm also curious it says you can play zera aura on the mobile version but can you not get the festival style pikachu on the switch version if you connect the two ah i mean i would assume you could but since it calls out one specifically and it does not call out the other well is it also calling out that you cannot buy you can't even buy zero aura on the mobile version i think so like their wording is so specific that it makes me nervous yeah like i'm not happy about that oh no because i mean there's cross play so yeah yeah there's cross play but since they specifically point out the one-way version of zera aura and they don't talk about the other things i'm wondering how deliberate that was or how lazy that was no i don't i don't think so yeah i it would be very weird if it was like well on the mobile version you cannot buy zero aura but if you have the switch version and you got the xero for free or you bought it then like i i can't imagine that would happen i also think i i don't know is a quarter of a million and a half a million pre-orders is that that seems like a lot a quarter of a million no oh sorry sorry five million people that's not a quarter that's millions and more 2.5 million or five million this is a lot it's worldwide it's not it's not it's worldwide it's it's it doesn't even have to be people who play all they have to do is indicate that they want to download the game so everybody listening to this download it so we can get the festival style pikachu please it seems like a lot even though that's like an ugly pokemon but sure i mean i mean how many did certain shield cell 21 million okay so there are more mobile devices out there than switches switches there are more mobile players out there than switches i would assume that time i knows how many obviously they know how many games like they have call of duty and they have their other moba games so they probably this is probably easy to hit i would assume i mean they'll say it is no matter what because why wouldn't they why wouldn't you say we made a 5 million goal and make it sound like a lot of people are interested in your game whether you hit it or not didn't that mario run game have like 10 million downloads or something the first month i don't remember i just did it from the app store so i put my one in there i did too uh well they showed two new characters that showed sylveon and they showed mama swine now there was a leak i don't know if leak is the right word there was rumors speculation i don't know put a big asterisk on what i'm about to say so before blissey came out there with cover your ears if you don't want to hear these this one character that they haven't shown yet but i i we have like no proof whether it's real or not but they before blissey came out there was a i'm gonna leak air quotes here that was blissey sylveon and greedent greetings was the other one yeah i've heard greedon um so well i mean like blissey obviously here it exists it's in the game now uh sylveon they just showed this past week so that seems to be right so i guess maybe it's safe to say that greeden is probably real but not here yet i don't know yeah i mean it is it's hard to say what is going to be playable and what might be things on maps like there are so many things that they are including and if you assume they'll be different maps with different characters to hit and different bosses uh like credent has been a boss before it's been a boston sword and shield so it's hard to say that that necessarily means that it's a playable pokemon is probably in the game we just don't know in what capacity yeah and then they showed sylveon uh which people like and then they showed uh mammo swine so before we get to mama swine are we starting off as evie or are we just gonna get sylvian uh the way they made it sound is it's just sylveon yeah that's what i would guess yeah i mean they already did just just lucario so yeah i mean it'd be really weird to do eevee and then it only evolves into sylveon without like getting into the very complex nature of how you're going to do all the eeveelutions in unite i think they're just going to skip it i'm going to say here's sylvia i'm assuming they aren't just also just giving us mamoswine because mammoth wine has a very direct path of level up yeah i would assume mamo swine is probably gonna be an all-arounder because like every three stage seems to be an all-arounder like charizard car chomp i don't know there's probably another one i'm thinking i can't think i think gardevoir is not an all-arounder that's true i mean i guess man was like a three-stage defender but blastoise is a three-stage defender we know blastoise is a defender it says on the official website uh i would imagine i don't expect it to be a speedster so i'm imagining it's an all-arounder famously kind of bulky and fast and the the screenshots they show though are like they keep showing it in the jungle because it was in the middle of the zapdos and then they show it attacking in the middle uh attacking uh crawdad so [Music] maybe it's an all-arounder i don't know i i don't think it's a defender they showed both of them in very similar situations yeah they did maybe they just like showing off the jungle more interesting than elaine everybody's like jungle jungle mammoth's my new jungle maine well i tell you i had a jungle blissey the other good night in the game yeah unless you went into the jungle i'm like what are you doing was it did you win no we did not uh we i had a jungle mr mime one time i said that they were on the other person's team and they were very good uh we lost [Laughter] uh yeah so they that they opened with unite that's pretty much all the united news uh two new characters the mobile date um i i think some people walked away being like oh cross play is a thing that they they definitely said this yeah they definitely said that before they said cross account and cross play would be things um but it's nice for them to like reconfirm that uh and i guess people finally heard it this time so i you know here's the question before we move on from unite the switch is not the most powerful system in the world uh you can see your frame rate in the upper corner it'll say like it never says 60 at all it's like 47 or 50. 47.48 yeah do you think that if let's say this was your favorite game ever unite was it it was your go-to you plan on dedicating your next 10 years to it league of legends in the garbage those people are out there yep do you think you would buy like the best ipad out there and just hook a playstation controller up to it and just play unite that way because it would i would i would assume even a three to four year old ipad would run better than the switch i mean maybe i mean i might i mean i have a i have a new ipad but i mean i'm just downloading it does it have to be an ipad could it be like a less expensive android device that has a high power processor and screen then the switch guess but i mean does it need the thick the tablet world the ipad is the dominant device and now i'm not so sure about that i mean what like is the frame rate that important to that game i don't know i if you just want an overall smoother experience i think the problem is like you're still going to get to that menu selection screen and it's still going to be super laggy because yeah it's trying to load in 10 people the only the only issue i ever seem to have is lag in the game not frame rate it's just like oh there's internet leg yeah i don't really notice like oh this isn't the highest quality of low quality graphics yeah i don't know i think it would be nice to have like i think the only thing that would make me switch from a switch to like an ipad is i would assume the controller would be more customizable because because on the switch version you can only you can't move the map and you can't move the like attacks off the shoulder buttons you can move them around the shoulder buttons but they're limited to it so and then like the chat has to stay on the d-pad for the switch version you can't like move it up to like the shoulder buttons if you wanted to so it is very like even though that the switch version has you know a control setting i would assume that like an ipad or an iv android version you could really customize the controls why would you assume that why what would restrict it why why would because the controls are determined by the app not by the platform yeah but if you're talking android you can do literally anything on android that's hacking that's that's that is that is illegal no you cannot and if you don't if you're going to go that far just install an android emulator on a desktop computer and go that way yeah because that way you'll get the best performance i would not be surprised if people do that yeah i'm sure but you're not gonna then become world champion and walk into uh an esports competition carrying your desktop computer and say oh but this is how i play you're going to say because you're disqualified you have to play the game the way the game was made and if you go beyond that it's broken and you're a bad person well if you go beyond that plus ultra but plus ultra oh the most episode i guess we're also assuming that you can even hook a controller up to the mobile version i would assume you could because i would assume you could i would give that yes because the platforms do support yeah the like bluetooth controllers i mean now i feel like i have to get a controller for my ipad which means i have no reason not to jump back into gungeon impact if i do this you just don't have like a bad situation you don't have playstation controller or the xbox controller why would he have either of those he does not have a playstation or an xbox i have a playstation 4 yeah there you go that's all you need uh just the ps4 controller yes ps4 ps4 ps5 something and i have an xbox something one do you really yeah how come you didn't friend me on either of these platforms because i never i have not turned mavic we disconnected them uh when we moved our living around except for i think i reconnected the xbox i don't know why because i still haven't turned it on the problem is there's two xbox one controllers one of them is compatible with ipad one is not so i would say go playstation i've heard that the playstation controllers are easier to hook up i mean can i just buy a controller specifically for the ipad and just connect it yeah but why would you do that when you could just get the playstation controller which is like the best controller out there because it a i don't know where it version i is no because the joysticks are both down it's nice now that's no okay so the switch the switch pro controller is garbage i prefer a playstation 4 controller over the switch pro controller i would hardly disagree except for the fact that katamari damasi does play better when the sticks are parallel it does uh they then showed pokemon go which wasn't anything specifically new uh they just showed some of that like wulu squelvet hey hoopa is making zashian and zamasunta and we're just skipping alola altogether yeah i'm not thrilled about i kind of which is weird which i don't have a problem with it it kind of goes with the i i feel like sometimes the pokemon company it starts to establish patterns we talk about it all the time in the show everyone likes to talk about the patterns on twitter you know gen 8 was supposed to have two new eevee evolutions because gen 2 had evs and gen 4 had evs and gen 6 had evs so gen 8 must have new evs and that didn't happen um i feel like sometimes they're just like you know we we started a pattern we don't like this skip gen seven do it we gotta throw them for a loop i mean are we going to talk about the fact that the pokemon go song got lyrics the only the night time no because i refuse to listen to any audio from pokemon go all together it gives me youtube true i i didn't look it up and ashwag's coming to community day yes password is coming in community yeah so well we can't record sunday the 19th we have to come up with a different day that's fine we can record early the one thing i want to say that wasn't shown in the du ra the presents but we should talk about is pokemon go is terribly broken right now they put phalanx in raids and then people couldn't see phalanx because it was too zoomed in so they had to like remove phalanx from raids and then they put i don't know they put like alec machamp or something to like substitute and then if you put phalanx as your buddy pokemon he's just vertical he doesn't actually like follow you he just goes like straight up like a totem pole like yeah he like doesn't look good in the menu i don't it's just phalanx really feel like this is ruined this game i haven't i also haven't found a failings like i think i mean i just got 20 of them on my bike ride this morning uh i haven't seen any in my area i haven't seen any of my any raids either it's just not well he's not right i got they did bump him up in the wild and i believe he's in eggs but i've seen like i don't know in the last 48 hours i've seen like three in my house i got i think i got all of the galler ones that are dropped i got squabbits i got wulu's i got phalanx what else is there i have no phalanx uh i have ice dara maca i have zashian right yeah zashians and raids right now yeah i didn't do a raid one though but i've not had a phalanx yeah they're around i got it i see their shadows they just don't come to me i got one in my house right now i have a pokemon go public service announcement about raids um if you're intending to invite me to a remote marine and it's gallerian wheezing i will be removing you from my friend list why it could be shiny don't i don't need shiny gallerian wheezing i don't that i don't need to spend a remote raid pass on that thanks also the notification system is really bad so you can send me things and i'll see it on my phone and by the time it actually pops up the lobby's gone yeah okay can we also talk about just okay how are we we're here this far into the life cycle of sword and shield uh-huh and the why calm is still that bad cause they haven't expect them to fix it yes people expect them to add the rest of the pokemon too i mean it is so bad trying to do chandelure raids this weekend and she was like i have the rate up and i'm like well maybe maybe wycombe will decide to show me we'll just keep hitting it restart it maybe it will start that it is so awful it is bad and i still can't believe like we are two years into its life cycle and they haven't even like stated we're looking into it i think it's just like nope it's gonna always be bad it's just bad yeah they got another they got other games to work on the one of my problems is anything internet related it's just it's even in 2021 it's so fragile it's like they could change one thing and be like oh this is going to improve it and then all of a sudden why calm doesn't work at all anymore ever it doesn't work now well i mean it kind of sometimes works i mean if they could just dynomax adventure like they got it mostly right yes mostly oh i would take the dynamics adventure system over the i i would as well uh but we don't live in that world we live in a world where they're not fixing the wycombe pokemon go very short during the presents uh i am meeting with niantic this upcoming week uh some content creators already have met with niantic in their task force team whatever that means uh we talked about that like last week we did we had special task force yes uh the special task force which is made up of niantic employees there was i think two meetings last week and one meeting this week this upcoming week so i'll let you guys know we'll see and i'll well we see everyone else is going to argue distance which is a fair argument i'm going to just ask for cramer ant and i that's i i agree yes just say another rosalia community will make it all better now uh you know they did some pokemon masters ex news here in celebration of pokemon's masters ex two year anniversary a new legendary event howling shield of eternity and the power of dynamaxing is coming to the game from now until september 15th players can assist gloria hop and leon as they try to help legendary the legendary pokemon eternitus which has arrived on the island along with a mysterious meteor playing through the event will reward players with the sink pairs hop and zap magenta what that means is it's free hop and zamasunte are free as long as you play the game gems and other useful items during the event cigna suit leon and eternitus will make their debut in sync pair scouting so trainers can add them to their teams trainers should also keep an eye out for the return of n and other sync pairs as part of the two-year anniversary and will be wearing an interesting new outfit and paired with a pokemon capable of doing damage to fo it's zekrom or restaurant which one isn't that interesting uh he already has that chrome uh the other thing that it doesn't say in this press release is you can get up to a hundred sink pairs for free which was like the big deal yeah during that little i don't know they spent like what two ma two minutes on masters yep and you know i was streaming this live on twitch and the amount of people who don't play masters uh uh in twitch is is a lot you know some people just don't like the gotchas i get it but they were really interested once it said up to 100 sink pairs for free that's a lot of sink pairs yeah and i pulled on one and i got all three stars so thank heavens it's free because is it 100 pulls it is okay yeah it's it's 10 10 pulls 10 10 pulls and there's no guarantee that you're gonna get anything good but hey at least it's free it's it's still they didn't like they didn't like uh adjust the odds for it it didn't it's a it's a seven percent chance for five stars which is what you want it's like a 12 what what is it like 15 chance for four stars or something like that then it's like a 75 chance of three stars which is the majority um but you get this little ticket when you log in i think you have more than 10 days to log in so they do give you i think it's up to september 15th i think so so like if you're listening to this podcast and you're on the fence for pokemon masters you're already going to get 3000 gems just for logging in now 3 000 gems is a normal 10 pole in the game it's seven percent for a five star twenty percent for a four star and seventy three percent for everything else which is right three stars so then you can get all three stars on your free pull yes i have done multiple you can also get all three stars on your paid plus you can it's really it's still really a bad system but so there there is a different system currently in the game right now um well not currently but that exists it's called fair scout which is what the leon banner is so leon so normally when a poke trainer is on a banner a banner being like oh i want to pull on leon or i want to pull on nessa or i want to pull on hop that doesn't well hops technically free but protect um they're normally two percent so you have a two percent chance of getting leon you got two percent chance of getting gloria you got two percent chance of getting nessa but in a fair scout when they you have a ten percent of getting five instead of a seven percent so leon right now is fair scout so let's say you're new to pokemon masters you want the hundred free sync pairs it's a lot of sync pairs it is genuine even if you get a lot of threes you're probably going to get at least a handful of fives so like it's still totally worth it um and it's free and it's free i mean it's worth it because it's free right and i don't think unless you're making content saving them up like they're not going to add anything new the new banners are not going into this 10 poll the temple is set so just use them they're not going to be like on september 14th add a bunch of things they didn't add before it's done this is it you can't save the tickets though you're like you don't have to like right you you'll get 10 tickets total uh if you do decide to play and you get the 3 000 gems you can either i would maybe suggest pulling on leon uh because it is fair scout and you can't use your free 10 poles for leon yep or you can maybe save for end which is one of the two year anniversary things which his i don't know his outfit's kind of okay it's it's a wedding outfit he's finally here to make good on what happened in the ferris wheel finally make make you an honest person after that incident uh green hair is an auto now on me so uh what was he gonna say about the tent pole okay so oh oh go in now because the sycamore event is back and the sycamores ernie's pair is like the most powerful free pair you can get and it's free and it's free you just have to complete that storyline that storyline isn't difficult to do i strongly strongly strongly suggest if you are interested in going in and playing play it now while the sycamore event is still live uh i don't remember when it ends i will look here real quick this is the thing about masters and we've talked about this on the show i don't know at what like the game is two years old i don't know what they could do at this point to convince people to play this video game and when they were like we're giving you a hundred sing pairs for free i was like okay i think that's how you convince people to finally play this game like that is that is a huge um like you're you're forcing you're not forcing but you're encouraging people to log in 10 days in a row once they log in they're gonna get their polls they're gonna maybe get a character they like they're gonna poke around the app like this is probably the best way to convince somebody that they should check out this game yeah how many sink pairs total are available in the game too many uh i can find out in a sec uh the legendary events that are currently active which are getsis sycamore and cyrus are up until 9 16. and normally um normally to pull so 3000 gems you get that for free too when you're logging in 3000 gems is about like 20 to 25 dollars in the game there is a 178 potential sink pairs right now jeez okay so there's no way to pull them all for free in this method if you're real lucky if you get it a bunch of them are free a bunch of them come from eggs so like you can get you can get there a lot of them come from bp so how does the egg work like the pokemon hatches from the egg and somebody walks up and says i paired with that one so you pair with it you yourself you your character pairs with it so yeah your own character pairs with it you get eggs by doing like training missions you can hold like four to eight eggs or whatever so all i'm saying is the storytelling consistency and logic of casio is a bit sus yes but they do do some good stories like the eternity story i think is really good the silver and giovanni's story was really good the guest's story was meh uh the you know cyrus wanted to marry a rotom in in pokemon masters so you know i'm withholding all judgment until this fall event where all of the evil teams you guys thought were going to be friendly because they live on pacio now turn and sabotage and saboteur and get getcha the only villain that has somewhat come across this slightly friendly is loosamine everybody else is like i still plan on destroying the world but i'm gonna work with you for a while because i can't get off this island except for cyrus he's really obsessed with that rotom the minute i can get out of this i'm going to blow everything up and get it so it's like lost yeah tv show guests and giovanni are already already hate each other they establish this in story they hate each other so this villain's event should be very exciting and uh they showed a silhouette of rose in the villains event which is cool rose is coming maybe i don't know it could be like diana on the cover and not come for two more years i don't know that the giovanni is rainbow rocket giovanni yeah so rainbow right so regular giovanni's in the game but it's rainbow rocket in the villains event so that's i'm wondering if we get a new giovanni pair did you see that the sigma suit giovanni did you see in the spanish version of the pokemon presents they included that giovanni will have mega mewtwo oh no i didn't see that yeah it was making me too why it was the baby looking one not the one so that must be what i wonder if they're gonna make it cigna suit or just a different yeah i don't know i noticed the rainbow rocket as well yeah again like i don't know if you're on the fence for pokemon masters like this is this is probably as good as it's getting like they're really pushing yeah and it's good like i don't i don't think it's bad i mean a lot of synth pairs for free a bunch of gems like you get your 3000 gems plus you get your daily log and gyms plus you get your event gems um i don't know i i think it's worth trying i mean it's free it's free you're getting a bunch of stuff for free so play around with it and if you hate it you hate it yeah you didn't lose anything you maybe pulled a lucid me and you're like well let's move on okay i got a challah another bryson man wow the bread no uh the last thing before we get to the two big things that they showed here was pokemon cafe remix i mean pokemon cafe mix the touch based puzzle game for the nintendo switch and mobile devices get is getting a revamp this fall along with a new name pokemon cafe remix updates will include new puzzle elements more pokemon new dress-up options and more ways of growing and developing your staff pokemon pokemon are now able to eat delicious meals prepared for them making them more friendly and more willing to become pokemon staff staff pokemon sorry new puzzles will make it easier to clear wait new puzzle skills will make it easier to clear puzzles which were introduced in cafe remix as well as the ability to combine megaphones to make them more powerful golden acorns collected uh in pokemon cafe mix will be able to be transferred to remix um wait do i have to install a new app no i think it's like when pokemon masters change their name it's just the app updated so why is it saying that the area because they do say it can be transferred which wouldn't matter if it was just an update to the game so again their wording in a lot of these things are like they leave a lot of questions that's okay guard escapes is done pokemon remix is the new one it does say free to start optional in-game purchases data charges may apply for mobile version users cannot transfer save data from the switch version to ios or android version or vice versa depending on the device or os users may not be able to use all features also it is in horizontal mode if they said cafe remix and the remix was them going from horizontal to vertical i would be i might be back in that would be it don't understand what do you mean back then you were never in in the first place level 12 in that game how hard is this how hard is this i don't want to do this why it's not okay first first off you can't play like this you are doing it just like that no because my hand my hand can't even reach 50 and when i'm like this i can reach it all why are you so lazy to not used to i can't have this debate against the world cannot cater to your weirdness what i would play clash royale clash royale was a brilliant design game they put all four at the bottom i could reach that you only you never had to reach higher in the field well maybe if you threw like a fireball i wasn't that kind of player but you could just play it with one hand it was like that or you could do the really lazy way of like placing it on the ground and then just using one finger like this you can still place it on the floor and horizontal move and use one finger and do that and that will also capture this is a two finger game you need both hands your other hand needs to be occupied because idle hands are the devil's tool yeah that's why no yeah we don't want to hear about your depravity drink your water play your classroom water that vodka looks like water uh cafe mix is a bummer and pokemon shuffle is a better puzzle game stay tuned for my cafe remix weekly reports i'll give you guys go on long live cafe remix this is what i'll say about cafe roommates two things or cafe mix because remix is annoyed two things number one i can't remember number one number two if you thought pokemon go and pokemon masters nickel and dime do cafe mix is highway robbery like like the acorns in that game and what they want you to buy is actually atrocious you put i never put money into it so no one ever talks about it everyone always talks about how pokemon go nickels and dimes you and how gems are too expensive and in masters which is very truthy because people play those games the oh number one i'm gonna say because cafe remix is going in the way of pokemon duel not too long for this world there must be something somebody must be playing a cafe mix because oh dylan dylan is playing cafe mix rumble rush only lasted a year yeah and they they shut that down so i don't know what who's playing cafe remakes but i think i told you dylan is i think the actual problem that i have with cafe remix is it's it's not good enough to the two games that it looks like so like pokemon shuffle i think is just a better puzzle game um and it was on ios and it was on 3ds and stuff and i really like shuffle a lot and then the other game that it actually looks like is disney tsum tsum and it's not as good as that either so it has like the tsum tsum that it looks like that i want it to be and tsum tsum is just a better how is it better qualify your statements because tsum tsum you don't have to like spin in this look so i i'm like level 12 or 13 and cafe makes and it's so far it's pretty easy but you have to like kind of like mix it well i get it because you're like mixing food you have to like mix it into into a way where it blows up blocks or it merges and then disappears in tsum tsum you're just matching lines it's like snake you're like oh i'm going to take all these mickey heads and i'm going to draw a line of all the mickey heads and then they're going to disappear so it's like you can't sore you can't move the characters in tsum tsum you're drawing the line and then they disappear and then the rest drop down so you're like i'm gonna clear this mickey and then donald's gonna drop down and now all the donald's are touching and then i'm gonna get rid of the donald's and then that drops down and then like oh buzz like yours now the buzz like you're at the top here was touching the buzz like you're at the bottom down here and now i can draw the buzz to get them and then when you do enough of that light year last year and then you get your little superpower then you hit the superpower and then things explode cafe mix never really had that it was just like okay grab like three chime echoes and like swirl them until they vanish like no what are you even talking about cafe remix is you you draw the line through all the things they just move with you and you can have them explode in specific ways it is basically how you're talking about tsum tsum know better version of tsum tsum it's not a better version because you actually can move them and have them to do i don't know why you want them because you're lazy you're lazy this is not a better game you're just lazy you won't turn your phone on the side i will take you to a round one we will we will play the tsum tsum and you will be like this is better it is better the soup soup is better then by making that statement there is no amount of dragging meat around one that will ever get me to agree that tsum tsum is better because you made that statement you know this about me you have doomed that game to forever be ignored by me disney soup soup is a better game is it a better game it's a far worse game it's awful i can't even believe they made it so bad give me your ticket but it's worse oh there's no debating it's not a cash grab that is true it is a hundred percent of cash we have been to the mall of america multiple times and that one tv dragged me into that arcade to show me tsum tsum it's not i don't want it because that's not it's not a it's nickelodeon they don't they don't have it yeah that's not not no no no the one the arcade on the fourth floor third floor yeah wait there's an arcade up there yes oh dude do you even pay attention no is it is it round one i don't know i don't think so okay let's take a break when we come back we're going to talk about diamond and pearl pokemon he came running in here before we hit start [Music] yeah that's the most that's that's the most important part look at this boy [Music] he doesn't even care he's just so bad he's just so boring that belly my other cats would not have that happen [Music] and we are back from our break you can't from them believe that oh my bad jeez all right here we go the pokemon diamond sorry the pokemon brilliant to diamond and shining pearl games enable fans to experience the original story and game features from

for more information please visit this link okay gold and silver remakes confirmed finally that's what we were waiting for the entire time uh this is what i want to say before we get into this at the end of the day it doesn't really matter how soon they would black or white it doesn't matter that's your heart uh it doesn't really matter if they would have shown this earlier in the year or later in the year i mean we knew the games were going to come out in november regardless but what i will say is it was a good trailer they really they really knocked it out of the park with this trailer it kind of had a little of everything i jammed there were some flaws i wouldn't say knocked it out of the park but maybe hit an infield home run yeah they had an infield home run for sure it was a very very good trailer and i i don't know if people are selling the fence after this right like you're either you're not well everybody's always on the fence yes don't don't deny people's ability to sit on the fence uh you know i i personally hate sitting on a fence i like to you know be on one side of the other i i will say i did not see the one thing that i was looking for in faithful remakes so maybe i'm on the fence what were you what will give give me your diamond of pearl history you i know you love black and white but did you love the deep played it to complete my living decks therefore i'm looking forward to playing it for the actual gameplay greg can you tell me the difference between the contest in gen 3 and the contest in gen 4 because they are different and i don't know why oh god uh i have to remember well in gen 3 they're contests and in gen 4 they're super contests you know gen 3 had the appeals round that affected things to fight and it only had an appeals round and then i think gen 4 it was a performance and an appeals run i have to hold on i have to remember all right you remember i'm going to go through some more bullet points here so the underground is back uh they renamed it to the grand underground uh it says the underground and diamond and pearl have been powered up in these games it is now called the grand underground the al the grand underground is a vast subterranean world that's spread out like a maze beneath the entire cinna region use the explorer kit when you you'll receive during your adventure to visit the ground underground which i think you get after the third gym yeah you got them after fighting uh gardenia uh where you can participate in activities such as digging up valuable treasures and pokemon fossils or you can create your own secret base you can also visit what's called pokemon hideaways which is a new thing where you can find pokemon that live in a variety of different environments pokemon hideaways come with a variety of different terrains ranging from still water caverns to volcanic landscapes with different pokemon living in each environment among the pokemon that inhabit the center region there are some pokemon that can only be found in these hideaways some walls in the ground underground can be dug into by using a sledgehammer or pickaxe this was in the original by digging into them you can find things useful for your adventure such as fossils as well as new statues that can be added uh that have been added to these games i'm going to stop here real quick and say when i played original dive into pearl i was i don't know like 16 or 17. i did not spend a lot of time in the underground oh i did and so by playing through platinum a year ago and having you know 200 plus people in my twitch stream be like oh you got to do the underground it's so fun as an adult it was not that like it wasn't it's like a cute mini game but there's not like something there's supposed to be like online interactive component to it yeah stuff yeah there was like local where you could like run around and tag and stuff but the like the actual mini game of like digging up fossils like it's it's a good mini game yeah it's a frustrating mini game sometimes but yeah but when like but if you don't care about red gems or blue gems or green gems or you're in the one camp where you're like i only care about red gems because i need 500 of these gems to teach one pokemon one move uh it's just not a good loop like it's just not there's not enough i think i think here's the thing it almost feels like a bad pokemon masters pull where you're like yeah i like pulling in pokemon masters who doesn't like trying to get like 10 different characters and hopefully one of those characters is good but in like the underground it was like yeah i like digging but when you're only digging up like like gold nugget like it's just like is there anything else here yes i mean post game there were a lot of fossils in there which is what i spent all my time getting so the fact that they're adding like statues so so look i i'm i'm not complaining about like i want the i i just want that mini game to like feel more fun and i think the way you make that feel more fun is you add like exciting things like hey i want to keep digging over and over for like a rayquaza statue that sounds cool yeah i uh okay i'm gonna chairman i don't remember the differences between gen three and four i don't remember being that different honestly uh so i don't know how they're different let me be real honest i mean they're different in this game because it looks like there's uh in the remix it looks like they're doing like a rhythm section yeah and that wasn't it omega ruby off of sapphire there was no like ddr no there that's that's new it's i think i don't even think there was a rhythm really a rhythm section in the musicals that i remember in den five so that i think that's new to this system um i'm a little i am curious if secret bases will actually be like secret bases before where you can have other furniture and things because the way they make it sound is it's just for statues and nothing else and before you could make like obstacle courses and you could put traps in your secret base and people could meet you and here they kept saying it they kept making it sound that it was just for statues which makes me less interested in customizing my secret base well the statues determine what the hidden realms are that you walk in well i think it changes what pokemon appear but looking at the map for the hidden realms it looks like hideaways the hyda waves are specific to each area and you can control what pokemon appear but they are going to be like the first one you run into is the grass one and then there's a fire one and when you're under snow point it's the ice one like if you look at the map on the web page it seems that the hidden areas the highways or whatever they're called are don't change but the pokemon in it will change based off of your statue so um there's some screenshots here one of the screenshots is like an overhead animal crossing grid look and it says 2 out of 18 statues placed in the room and then the second one shows a bunch of statues that has like a green charizard a green venusaur it has a snorlax on a stand it has a pacharisu and a krogan on a stand and then it has a non-green tertwig chimp chart and piplup not on stands so i don't know if i'm reading too much into that as like maybe the green charizard is more rare than a non-green charizard or maybe the snorlax on the stand is just rare because it's on a stand is there a snorlax not on a stand like why why is this venusaur green and the people before so it could be that the three starters are dolls and not statues like there's a lot i have a lot of questions also before you could only have one secret base so my question is is do the statue the statues one can you have multiple secret bases for each area or does your one secret base statue change the pokemon in all of the hidden areas because you can still only have one secret base yeah like i don't underst i don't know which way they're going you're gonna swap out those statues man yeah every time it says build that's a so it says build your very own secret base decorate it with pokemon statues you can use an item called the digger drill in the grand underground to build yourself a secret base within the walls pokemon statues you can find while digging fossils which that was not there before so again exciting um hopefully you can uh they can be placed where when it uh wherever you like inside your secret base so you can customize your own space it says adventure together with trainers all over the world in the ground underground you can integra interact with trainers all over the world through your nintendo switch systems local communication or online communication as well as together in the grand underground you can dig for fossils together with other trainers and they show two screenshots the top screenshot has two dawns and three whatever that dude's name is where's the male 1 not dawn i love not dawn three dogs eat no ethan is gold dagnabbit brendan no brendan is his what is the gen 4 dude's name clyde charles billy billy there's never been a billy billy esteban uh okay it is dawn and uh ethan is jen ethan and chris is gentoo jimbo is is gen three lucas and don is lucas how could we forget lucas okay and then the bottom screen shot shows hilbert and hilda are gen 5. bottom screen shot shows one dawn to lucas's so lucas lukai lukai ludicolos i think the the hideaway okay so the hideaway stuff is is like them acknowledging knowing wanting to put overworld pokemon into the game yeah like like i was excited for that because you see this little chibi side duck walking around and this little b doof and this like gastrodon like slugging along and then you see your character kind of run past those um and i will die on this hill i think random encounters are bad they're not fun anymore yes i mean as a person who has a show about random encounters i'm still really liking them i think what they did in certain shield is a perfect balance in the wild area where there was some like the grass could shake you could run up to it and but you could see all the pokemon like like i think sword and shield had such a good balance and i get it you know if they can't do if they didn't want to or they they real they wanted to keep the random encounters for the integrity of faithful remakes yeah but i i do love i think there's a good compromise to have this area um who knows if it's going to be like let's go where like they're shining in the overworld or they're not but um i wonder if this is going to be also a way of shiny hunting i'm sure it is like are there shiny improving statues yeah or you need to have all the rarish statues that have i don't know like like have an increased shiny encounter it'd be cool they're not even increased but like what if you know cast forms of one percent and if you want to increase the cast form cast forms in this game yeah yeah do you do we want to talk about the pokemon they showed and what that meant for the pokedex uh the next thing on our list was contest okay so is that a no do you want to come back to the pokemon stuff i think i think we have to get through the let's get through everything all right um [Music] fine super contests were popular performances in cinema each by four performers and their pokemon who work together to show off their performance skills during the show you can dress up your pokemon in your favorite outfits and your pokemon will dance making it an uh altogether a different experience from the usual battles of strength up to four people can't participate so show off your best performance with your friends to really wow the crowd super contests are divided into five categories coolness cuteness beauty toughness and cleverness which each has different ranks of normal great ultra and master super contests are judged based on visual evaluation dance evaluation and move evaluation and you can receive hype points based on your evaluations and if the combined total of all four performers height points reached a target's score the show will be declared a success i i'll give it a chance i don't think i did any contest in gen 3 or omega ruby or i you had to do one yeah yes i do enjoy contests i think it is i think like the the the puffin and maxing out the beauty or whatever toughness that's like that's that that that's kind of fun what i'm what's interesting is they added an entire new section with the move the dance section between visual and move like there's a rhythm game in the game that is different from the two standard perks which is how well have you raised this pokemon and dressed it so the visual beauty which is like you just get judged and then the move part was always there which was use moves and unique ways to debuff other pokemon to buff yourself to get appeal points and those are still here in the visual and move parts as far as i can tell yeah it's the dance part that i think is going to be controversial because it is a rhythm based game and therefore somewhat dexterity based i'm real bad at rhythm games that said contests are completely optional and you never have to do them so i don't think it's that big of a deal i don't think so either um i mean like if you don't know game freak did make a rhythm game it was called harman knight and it came out on the 3ds gosh seven years ago or something i think it was longer than that wasn't that uh but it was called harmonite and it had no pokemon stuff in it except i think there was a pokemon song you could do near the end that you can unlock but yeah i mean it comes down to whether or not you like rhythm games i'd be curious on that in 2013 so eight years ago i'd be curious if the ribbons line up with the ribbons in gen 4 because there was a lot of gen 3 ribbons that were similar in ruby and sapphire and then similar in omega ruby but omega ruby added like 10 more new ones or something like that and they really really went all in on stickers yeah speaking of stickers use capsule decorations to create effects according to your taste using capsule decorations you can place stickers to customize the effects and appear when a pokemon comes out of the pokeball for battles or super contests with over 90 different stickers you can customize your ball capsules with fluttering effects flower pedals raging flames you can buy stickers in the shop but you can also get them in other ways by defeating gym leaders or being successful in super contest shows that's how you get the rare stickers yeah where you can flex in your non-ranked ladder battles yes again i wasn't super into st maybe i was just an edge lord 16 year old i was like you just want to play through pokemon maybe you were just one battle yes you were you absolutely were an edge lord 16 year old you had i did have a chain wallet yeah but i still don't know what your hairstyle was so i don't know how committed i i had a faux hawk oh god why do i know you i this look he's not a child any longer yeah i've only gotten um you they got rid of the letters right there's no way because in the original yeah no words yeah i guarantee they got rid of the letters because that that was bad and since it's now online it's real bad so they got rid of the letters and they just have pretty stickers like stars and conventions petals and hearts but you can add up to 20 which seems like a lot yeah i like the little like grid thing they showed what's interesting is it's got a you can either do it in 2d mode or 3d mode so you can either do it on a grid or freestyle in 3d mode and are we assuming that where you place it is where it will appear in front or behind or below that's how it was so that's how it worked in the original yeah yeah but it i mean like it was so small that it was like really hard to tell yeah i have a feeling it will not be as hard to tell on this one but also it's it's it's like what a less than a one second animation like it goes so fast that it's it would be hard to tell anyways i could see that confetti coming out behind that yeah i mean yeah you can see it tell this to the stars and square shiny people yeah you're right i'm just saying that like if you put the little lightning bolt in in the center bottom right square is somebody gonna notice if like you put it one square over there is someone who's only art is the art of pokeball customization like wow that effect was incredible but you should have just moved that you should have moved that lighting bolt two pixels over it would have been a much it would have been like you don't know how i mean it looks good in the picture it looks like you can tell because pachariso's got those things over and if that lower left-hand one was up a little i'd like it better walk around with your favorite pokemon once you've progressed through a certain point in the game you can choose one pokemon that you have befriended at a time to walk behind you any pokemon that appears in those games can walk with you so choose a favorite to travel through the center region so as you visit lots of places and make memories together now i don't know if uh our audience remembers but there was a place in diamond and pearl and platinum called an amidity midi park amity park amity park amity park um which was after the fourth gym i think maybe third everything's after the third what is the center town is that heart home where fantina is supposed to be but she's it's there it's yeah it's in the same town as fantina and heart home isn't it you mean she's not there she's not that the first time you get there oh yeah it's heart home city she's not there the first time yeah avenue square is uh in that city it's the north section and you could only bring cute pokemon yeah you can only bring like eight pokemon in and then in platinum it like upped it to 20 pokemon or something yeah i got real mad what they're considered cute so you could you could walk around like a pikachu or a bee doof or i think like a cricket and you could just huh that wasn't allowed in there i think b do fuzz i am looking at pokemon permitted pikachu give me the list harry psyduck turtwig grottle totera chimchar monferno infernip piplup princeplup napoleon pachurisu drifloon banari happini and then after the next national decks jigglypuff torchic shroomish and skitty so you could obviously you could have pikachu follow you in pokemon yellow yeah but this that the uh amidity amity park sorry is like the first time you could pick a pokemon and walk around with it and it really didn't do anything but it was cute so in a 2021 game where keem freak and the pokemon company knows that people like pokemon following behind you what is this park going to be doing i would maybe assume that the park is what unlocks the following pokemon but they show the trailer very early on pokemon following you obviously you can backtrack well yeah i don't think it's very early on they show cities where you're in but not when you get it i would imagine it is in heart home city where you get that ability i'm just curious what this little park is going to be doing now there's a lot of questions like integration with pokemon go there you go biggest the biggest thing in the park was you could get you could find like items on the ground you could find atoms on the ground they would randomly pick things up and imagining that part is staying and they probably got rid of the cuteness requirement and just said here come into the park your pokemon will follow you around and then you can pick things up uh and then uh from that po point forward your pokemon can follow you in the over world i don't even remember i think mostly you just got contest items in the park i want to say there was a tm hidden in one of the little caves that were like not caves but like little tree house things that they had and i thought you could pick up like a power were hidden in there the spooky plate was hidden in there and the amulet coin was hidden in there but that's exciting i mean like people freaked out when walking pokemon came back like at this point it's like a standard i feel like yeah i don't know why it was ever i don't know it's just it doesn't like make or break a video game in my opinion like i can't imagine somebody's like oh man diamond pulls my favorite game ever but if there's no walking pokemon i'm not buying it like i i'm sure that one person exists in an infinite universe anything is possible but glee blorb is like no but it's always funny because i'll post like i don't know clips or tutorials on youtube or instagram or whatever tic tac and then people will be like how did you get the pokemon to follow you in sword and shield and it's like oh you must uh missed the dlc part of this game man it's the dlc uh interact with trainers around the world in the union room union room is a facility where you can enjoy battling and trading with other pokemon and trainers to the nintendo switch system or other communication in a local room trainers can gather by local communication to enjoy trading battling and other activities in the global room trainers can use the online communication to gather in a single room for trading battling online communications ah now again i don't know if a lot of people remember this but back in the day when you joined the union room you would be randomly assigned an npc as your character and sometimes it wasn't what you would want like i don't want to be the hiker i don't want to be the swimsuit guy and so i'm looking at screenshots and you can see the hiker you can see the like country girl um you can see like the old lady and like the little psychic dude with like the hair swoop and they always have like an abra or kadabra are is it randomly a and then you see lucas well you see yourself out i saw yourself as the character as yourself and how you appear to other people right that was i remember like that because when diamond pro came out that was the first time i was on like four we all can't be the same people well no but that this leads into like the added character customization in this game not enough so are they ignoring the character customization customization for the youtube how the character customization works yeah they showed a little bit of it you're only getting full outfits it's not like i got the leather exactly sure that did you look at the menu yeah it said this style that style that style that style it did not say leather jacket jeans leather jacket like there is no there is no split tabs on this you're missing the really important thing for faithfulness which i find hilarious which was there were literally two rooms and you walked into i'm gonna walk into the local room i'm going to walk into the global room yeah rather than walking into a room and then having a menu come up that say do you want the local room because that that functionality never had any problems ever yes they did they did they did show character customization well hold on we'll circle back they showed character customization it says you will be able to buy and change outfits at the metronome style shop in vailstone city i just want to say one thing in diamond pearl and platinum you could pick your permanent trainer style you had to go talk to a specific person in orburg city and they would let you pick how you appeared to other people well which trainer type you appeared at yes yes oh i see i see i didn't know that yep so in that one and then they also did that in heart gold soul silver i think it was only random in gen 3. they showed outfits although will is right they only showed like four outfits and it looked like full outfits and the website is saying you can buy and change outfits at the metronome style shop in valeson city if you were curious what that means the metronome style shop is where the game corner used to be yeah so goodbye hello close they only showed four outfits they were complete outfits we don't know if there's more we don't know if you can customize these outfits the outfits they showed were very cute though like they were all really good outfits everyday style eevee jacket style winter style leather jacket style um so uh yeah we we don't know that uh it it's cool you can pick your skin color um like this was this was one of my complaints for dot for omega ruby alpha sapphire that we've talked about that why didn't they just let me pick who i could be why don't they just have a couple outfits this game has done that there's another podcast that would have said i can't believe there's a single person in the world that looks at these games and says i can't customize my character that's a no it's not gonna be like yes and i'm sure that podcast is done by three white dudes that are like who cares about being your skin color there are plenty of people of color that would kill to actually have some sort of reference in my day you couldn't be a girl so that's true yeah so it's a work in progress uh do we now want to talk about wild area and the pokedex yeah so ferrari's like oh i wonder what the if the national decks and stuff is going to be there uh going by past games and what they showed in the wild area they showed pokemon in the wild area that did not appear anywhere in any of the diamond pearl or platinum pokemon are we talking about highlights yeah the hideaways the hideaways so in the hideaways in the hidden realms in the shadow realms uh there's a number number was not in any of the pokedexes if i remember correctly and it's in this game so [Music] like speculation about what will be and won't be in the pokedex and sort of out the window right now because we don't saw something i need to go back and look at one of the screenshots of that it was the ice area and i was like this is kind of suss where okay where was that in and like there's a centered in there and a pretty sure center isn't in i i still find it hard to believe although unbelievable nonetheless that they would release a game after sword and shield and that game wouldn't have some of the most popular pokemon currently on people's minds like score bunny grooky um for me cramer ant although i would you know as much as i like cramer ant like cramerran is featured in a lot of merchandise and a lot of um it was in the movie and it like whether or not the us likes cramer we definitely know the people over in japan like cramer ant so i do think concentrate it's not in the pokedex for diamond pearl or platinum also so we already have a couple of pokemons shown on screen that aren't that are in the hidden hideaways that aren't in the old pokedex so all guesses about what this pokedex will be are off the table because we don't know what they're doing yeah we don't know if like the hideaways have gen a pokemon right and that's something things unlock post post game like do these only appear when you get shadows that they only like with certain sizes you get post game like we don't know but i think people who are making declarations about this will for sure be a national dex or this will for sure only be the platinum decks we have no clue there is not a single there is no way that they released sword and shield with missing 200 pokemon and then a non-game freak game comes along and includes all 800 some pokemon there's not as it's not happening there's no way but we don't like we don't know what the pokedex is gonna look like at this point like we can assume because they've stated going forward from sword and shield not every game will have all pokemon in it yeah so it is unlikely that this game will have all pokemon in it well well you so you brought that up and i was going to save this for the arceus conversation but like like like they they they did 28 minutes of pokemon news and then the last like 14 seconds they're like by the way by the way uh ranked battles will not take place in these two new games they will continue taking place in sword and shield goodbye and then they ended it which is like fine yeah but i i just can't imagine and i just want to lay this out here i just want people to think about this that there's no way that diamond and pearl have all 800 pokemon there's just no way there's no way that legends of arceus and this hasn't even been brought up there's no way that game has all 800 pokemon either no oh heck no heck no we're going to be lucky if that game has like 200 pokemon but like somehow the narrative around arceus is like that that's not even a consideration like people are looking at arceus and they're like this is a new style of pokemon game i want it it's not i'm interested in this pokemon game but it better have all the pokemon like that's not even on the table for most people or the conversation like it was for sword and shield so we have we have four games on the nintendo switch from that are pokemon games we have let's go pikachu let's go eevee has 153 pokemon we have diamond and pearl let's just assume that it's gonna have 490 whatever pokemon that was in platinum or whatever it was i think 490 the first time it was 493 for platinum uh we have arceus which lucky if that has like 400 pokemon like i don't think so but so why do people just assume that because of that message ranked battles will continue in sword and shield they're gonna add the last 200 pokemon why why would they do that so i i do think because there's a couple of things that make me think that there's going to be some sort of update coming from for sword and shield one because i don't think we're getting gen 9 until 2023 so we will not have you don't think that they're going to do something holiday of 2022 no no they're going to do something but i don't think it's gen 9. yeah they're going to make a white remakes i mean i don't i don't think they're going to do gen 9 next year i don't think that's happening because of the delay this year because everything has been pushed back okay so i don't see that in a coveted sense that developers are behind gen 9 is going to happen in 2022 i think it's going to be 2023 which leads me to think we are going to get some sort of update for sword and shield because there will be new pokemon coming in arceus which we'll talk about i don't think it's going to be a full dlc i do think they might do uh hey we're adding some pokemon in from these games and it'll be a free update but i do think because there's going to be so long before the next generation and we will have been sitting in sword and shield for ranked battles for what almost four years at that point there is going to be some sort of update to sword and shield i don't know what that looks like i don't think it includes everything but i do think because they are introducing new pokemon in arceus which we'll get to that they are going to do some sort of update to bring those into sword and shield i can agree with you there that there will be that there could be an update whether it's free i think it's real dangerous for them to do a paid update at this point yeah um well but if they decide to fill in a gap for not having something for christmas and make it a dlc and something else that i could see maybe i just i just don't see a world where they're like okay we're missing 230 some pokemon and we're going to fill it in because like how do you even market that think about this part because because shield's missing 230 pokemon okay yeah but they've done dlc where they add completely new pokemon that aren't filled in pokemon yeah but a lot of people are not a lot of people some people are assuming that because these two new games aren't doing ranked and because there's still this speculation that sword and shield is missing the rest of the pokemon so therefore it should get the rest of the pokemon i am just arguing i'm just arguing that there's no there's no dlc i don't think that that includes 230 pokemon oh no no no no i could definitely see what greg said where they release a small update that's like here's stantler and it's evolution here's uh vasco legion here's a couple pokemon to coincide with arceus but even if they didn't add any new pokemon they already have ranked figured out because a ranked season lasts three months so we're right now in season 10. that's going to go till november season 11 is going to flip they still have not done the gs cup um that's going to be three more months so season 11 takes us to what february then they do a different version of the gs cup that takes us to march april may and then they do of season 13 takes us into worlds they only have to do three different rule sets gs cup being two of those rule sets you do a g x cup g s cup a g s cup for those not competitive or when you're allowed to use two box legends right now we've only been able to use one box legend so gs cup is two box legends easy you do gs cup with dynomax you do gs cup not dynamax that's six months of content that they don't have to worry about the pokedex that while maybe if you're not a competitive fan no one cares competitive people want the gs cup that is like the thing that they have been dying for like season 10 just doesn't scratch that itch they just want the gs cup so gs cup no dynomax gx cup with dynamics that's six months of competitive content so even if your argument is like well i gotta add the rest of the pokemon cause competitive is boring like you clearly aren't a competitive person like like adding wormpole and gorvus isn't going to change the sta the state of competitive having two boxed legendaries in your team is going to change the state of competitive um and for a third version they could just do another band right like they could just say like hey we're banning incineroar we're banning landorus we're banning like these and now here's your season 11. um like i think in a competitive sense filling out the rest of the pokedex just doesn't actually make sense in a marketing sense i think filling out the rest of the pokedex also doesn't make sense how do you go from like hey this dlc has 40 different legendary pokemon and a brand new like area to go like hey this dlc has wormpole and gormbus and clan pearl sounds riveting right like it just feels like very hard to market although i'm into it although i mean i guess they just i think i don't think it's that hard to market i think you're like because you can't figure out how you would market it doesn't mean that that's a reality i think they can definitely market however they want and would be very successful in it because it's their job i'm not worried about i i they can mark they have marketed all sorts of things that i'm like why are you doing this but people still buy it but i think i mean they couldn't market their way out of pokemon rumble well i mean you can only do so much with a bad game i i do think that they will need if if gen 9 isn't happening next year and i really doubt that it is they do need something to keep people engaged with pokemon and sword and shield since it we will still be playing that game at that point and there needs to be something there there's no way that the pokemon company doesn't put out a big product before christmas right but i don't i don't know that that's going to be gen 9. i think in this in a in a non-coveted world i think that is a gen 9 but i think you're right right we're not in that world because like if you if you if you're following other gaming news and you're you're you're looking at other developers out there every like theoretically we've gotten almost everything on time there have been some game delays like the big game delay was halo for the xbox but other gaming sources have reported that once these games come out they are so behind for the next game because of how covid has affected the work at home and because of how they had to change everything and and in in a in a sense like it is really hard for creative people to have creative ideals and have creative talks when everything is through zoom like creativity normally happens like oh i bumped into somebody in a hallway and we brought up this idea and now we're gonna make it reality or like oh remember at lunch where uh bob dropped his milk carton and we thought like it is really hard to be creative and to have thoughtful and fun conversations when you're just i would argue differently i don't think that's the issue i think game developers are using this all as an excuse to slow down the pace that they've been forced into by the wild frenzy of having to stay relevant in the market but also if we know that the 30th anniversary is 2026 and we assume that they will release they care about the 30th anniversary because they don't care about the 25th if they do the 10 gen 10 2026 for the 30th anniversary that means three years before that is 2023 which may also make sense from a timeline to release your gen 9. and it's it's three years after gen 8 came out so eve it's like even timing wise 2022 feels a bit weird even if we weren't at this sort of covent stuff and i think covet has made that more of a lock to push back gen 9 to 2023 and in that case there does need to be some giant release next year around christmas i don't think it's gen 9 i think it's something else but because people will probably not consider it a main series game because people are weird there will be some form of minor update to sword and shield to keep people happy i one wouldn't be surprised if there was a re-release of sword and shield that included all the release like a third version a third version they could um with all the dlc and some extra stuff i wouldn't be surprised if that was a thing the pokemon company is very good at double dipping on whatever they already have yep literally i know i know we can point fingers at niantic and be like hey look it they released zashi and why even bother doing it they're going to release it again as it's shiny we're going to get pokemon z that's what's going to happen yeah smacked but i but they're they're there there's still a reason why these two games are so close together diamond and pearl and arceus and they haven't showed that off yet but there has to be a reason they're only three months apart if they were if they didn't have a plan for october november of next year they could have easily just held arceus till then i suspect that arceus is not going to be this grand huge game that everyone thinks it is i don't think it's going to have this huge pokedex i don't think it's going to have things that normally pokemon games have like breeding like that like no one has even brought this up like there's probably not breeding in this game there's probably no eggs there's probably there's no daycare because people and pokemon are separate yeah like i don't i like like there there is no you there's no pvp in right in arceus like they came out and said that they they did come out and say hey you'll be able to trade with other people but it is a single player experience i just don't think like i think arceus will be fine i think it will be fun like it looks great i just don't think it will be this huge game that i'm worried that people suspect it is because we cannot get away from the conversation that is this is pokemon broke breath of the wild and that's a high those are high expectations anytime a game is compared to breath of the wild no one beats breath of the wild breath of the wild is just like this this game that will be remembered for all time like ocarina of time or like super mario 64 that is like this epic amazing game and of course companies want to copy that of course companies look at that game to be like can we be that game and i just don't think legends is going to be breath of the wild i just don't think it will be this huge i think it will be fun and that's okay i don't think every game needs to be as big or as grand as breath of the wild although it'd be nice if they could match it um but it's not like they're going to start gen 9 after arceus i'm sure they've started gen 9 as soon as they've finished sword and shield yeah uh and i'm sure it's been and sword and shield is going to be two years old in two months three months next year is three years since sword and shield so theoretically they would have gen nine done it's just it's just very weird that arceus is in january yes and diamond and pearl is in november yeah i just it's not weird in the sense that they're both cinno like that makes sense well then apples i have issues um but there has to be something big to fill out their holiday yep and if it's not gen 9 then obviously the gen 9 would be the following year i don't yeah what i don't know what it is makes more sense 20-23 really because it's gonna put three years i don't disagree i agree that puts three years between each gen and i guarantee they're aiming gen 10 for the 30th anniversary it's a sword and shield third edition that includes kalos and i did think that i did think if they did a dlc they could put in chaos because it would put another region they're going to charge you for that air 60 bucks make it yeah pay for expansion why not go to kalos they'll all be under leveled because we didn't change that game in any way your helmet takes your level 100 to caleb's it will still crash okay but okay even if we go back to the competitive conversation they have three seasons to bring us to august we going to go another year into sword and shield competitive until we get to gen 9 or are they gonna put out something maybe it's a new pokemon battle revolution like they're just being like hi this is where we're moving competitive to this only competitive gym game it's pokemon battle revolution two now with mirror b all pokemon competitive is just unite [Laughter] i mean they they can definitely get away with skipping a year i mean they skipped last year i mean they put out dlc but like there wasn't a brand new game on the shelf they skipped 2015 i think which was the year right before um which was the year right before sun and moon uh which everyone thought pokemon z was going to come out that year nothing did i don't know if you get away with really with releasing a game in january and then putting nothing else out for 11 months that that being said there's also the conversation that gen 9 doesn't have to come out in october november it could come out in march it could come out in april very very much so yes black and black and white came out in in the united states that came out i believe in march the thing that i think of is that we will get something around christmas and then gen 9 will happen in the early part of 2023. like i can see it being an earlier release than than sword and shield was like turn jam was november and i could see them doing uh gen 9 in the first half of 2023 what i don't see is i don't see uh i don't see like a let's go johto or whatever other people are speculating that's just you're you're building a whole new game from the ground up again like they need time to finish gen 9 i mean if they're if they're just adding on and editing and fixing like a sword and shield re-release which is possible which i think is maybe a little more more likely than other scenarios like we saw with ultrasound ultra moon they did it in less than a year the engine for let's go is already built though right true so i don't think creating all of johto would be the problem i don't think it's that hard when i say i mean i think if if if just copy and paste they're good at it yeah they're cut and copy paste and then shrink it 65 for chibi uh i think it's just a reduction it's image reduced i i do think it is possible that we would get another game similar to let's go that when they realize at the beginning of the pandemic like we need to we need to work on something because these time frames aren't going to work out and they've had they will have had almost two and a half years to work on that product and they wouldn't have built it from the ground up so i think it is possible because you on an existing game you don't need that creativity meeting part because those things are already made they can be built in silos away from other people because you're just recreating something and you have the art direction done i i think it's i don't think it's as far-fetched as a lot of things because i do think recreating a game or building off an existing engine can be done individually and not as much in teams like where you have to be at a core meeting and talk about art direction and talk about pokemon fitting together because the game is already established the script is already written you just need to make the assets yeah i just think there was a little bit more passion behind let's go like they did read they did write a new story they did fix issues write a news story like it was cute like the whole marowak thing and everything was very good i mean they they they changed a couple of things which is not that hard to do like the basic story of jesus here's the other thing i wanna i wanna point out is it like the art direction for both diamond and pearl which makes sense because diamond pearl is made by ilka and the art direction for arceus is not done by james turner his name hasn't been brought up right at all since sword and shield so i because he got fired for trees yeah because i hated the trees so much they sent them back to the uk go back to england and study your trees so i am sure that like there's no doubt that they're working on gen 9 yeah they probably started gen 9 the day that gen 8 shipped at the door because or before because uh james turner wasn't also involved at least that we know of or wasn't publicly talked about the dlc like the dlcs are also probably being worked on and whatever um i i i guess we'll we'll find out all of this come february of next year they'll release arceus february will come they'll be like we got some arceus dlc here's our plan for the year whatever and it will be fine pokemon day 2022 will will bring us all sorts of interesting ideas sure 26th anniversary remember all the things we didn't do last year we broke the pattern we're doing sixes now i just i i just don't see 230 pokemon coming to sword and shield i just don't see that happening you've been wrong before i have been uh i've been wrong a lot of times on this podcast i was right with mamoswine so put it on your linkedin profile i'm sure it is believe me every time i'm right it goes on the leaderboards uh they showed the swamp mechanics and the snow mechanics again those are not fun the one thing i'm i'm super happy that they they they showed character customization i know we talked about it earlier i do think it's super important i think representation in games is incredibly important um i think the following pokemon is a nice touch i think the chibis look better than they looked back in february uh overall i was super impressed with the trailer um i'm very i've always kind of had the mindset of like sword shield is like my favorite pokemon game probably besides that it's probably ultrasound ultramoon it's really hard for remakes to like surpass and be my favorite pokemon games because they usually like go this weird route or they usually cut things or um in the case of diamond and pearl if there's no sword and shield pokemon that seems really weird to me but i also understand but also like like i don't but like the lack of no competitive or ranked ladder is like kind of a bummer but i also get that too because it's not a game freak game it's an elka game um overall though it looks like at the end of the day they look great they look really fun it looks way more i think they have a fantastic look absolutely they do yes i mean apart from the fact that rourke is looking like he's whatever mess it is a world i want to play in 100 it's just it grabbed me the same way the let's go world did it's just like this is a world i want to play in it looks cute i'm excited for it uh they had some new music i don't know if the new music is gonna be the game but i liked it the only thing that they didn't show or talk about but we know it's there i saw i saw the path for rock climb we don't know if hm's are here or not hms are going to be in the game 100 they would have shown some sort of writing on pokemon if they were not going to be in the hm's will be in the game i put my coin on that square i don't want to agree but i since they have not said that they're gone i i have to agree with authenticity authenticity i do think i don't know if they changed the language at one point but if you went back and like obviously the website's all up to date now with with the new information but like right before the press release i reread the original website and they said the story was faithfully restored and i felt like it never said that when they initially were launched so they like changed some words of the story is faithful i think they when people were like arguing that this is a one-for-one complete recreation with nothing changed because of the one word faithfully that they decided to clarify and say the story is a faithful one because we're clearly changing things and here's the here is the trailer to prove it here are the things we're changing and one of the things they did not mention was hms yeah but there's lots of things that are like the park the gts tower there's lots of things that have to be changed so yeah the i mean the gts tower what did it exist anywhere with union rooms and since they run everything through home what goes there why would you want to manage two different trading posts so i don't know what goes in that spot they just didn't mention that either i thought the way that let's go handled hm's was perfect do we still have to find three clowns in that stupid city yes if you watch the trailer there is one of the clowns there for i know that some people are not sold on the chibi i definitely get it i do think the chibis look much much better than they did earlier but i didn't hate them before and they were chibis in the original game yeah that's where it takes me back to like to the original pokemon world that drew me in in the first place uh we're we're gonna take a break and talk about arceus but i do think it's comparing arceus art style to sword and shield art style to diamond and pearl art style to let's go art style one boy four different styles but yeah looking back on let's go man that art style was so good i think let's go probably the one i gravitate towards the most uh uh i don't know it was cute it's not my favorite it's it's very i'll say this about let's go it is very very bright and optimistic right it's got a very bright pe pull up a screenshot of let's go to diamond pearl it's like diamond pearl lost about 300 different colors like what happened here all right let's take a break when we come back we'll talk about arceus legends or legends arceus and we'll see you after the breaks [Music] a [Music] that [Music] that is [Music] band [Music] and we are back i forgot we forgot this one thing before we talk about arceus there's a manafee egg nude receive a manafee egg as a special early bonus for brilliant diamond and shining pearl you can receive your egg by the internet via the mystery gift until february 21st you put your party carried around it will hatch into a manafee a internet connection is required but online nintendo paid subscription is not required this is the sword and shield i didn't see this in the pokemon presents and i watched it multiple times this is in diamond or pearl oh that game's not out yet and no it wasn't in the presentation but it is on the official website then if you check the manafee and the ditto into the nursery uh you can get a fione and just because i guess people didn't know this but fiona also makes fiona yeah and peony does not evolve into manafee correct because it needs the special waters of the region that it comes from and obviously you're not there until they come out with their big uh fall 2022 release pokemon ranger remix wait is that we spinning you need special water that's that's the reason why the fiones don't evolve yeah yeah because they're not in the waters of oh god it's not it's not all mia the first game is not all me oh the second game is definitely shadows of all mia right oblivia oblivia got it uh pokemon legends arceus uh will take trainers on an adventure through the cinahl region of the past before it was even called sinnoh yeah it's not the cinna region i got issues already what do you mean it's not the cinder region it's like a male well who is that country called malmar burma myanmar myanmar is what it was what are you even talking about no incorrect this is so geopolitical and offensive i am that's right no different political parties call that country different things istanbul was can santa nopel correct istanbul's not contact myanmar was burma right because of a political decision that was like if our current president said i didn't like the name of the country our former president called it so i'm calling it something else that's what that is how do we know that in sin oh it wasn't we don't this is my first issue the he's sweet it's always political uh yeah uh many years ago the land was called the hugh sweet is that my am i saying that he's sweet uh region and it was rare for humans and pokemon to live in close harmony as a member of the galaxy expedition team players will visit jubalife village a bustling settlement that serves as the base of operations after receiving an assignment or request trainers will set out of the village to study one of the various areas of the hugh sui region uh after don't worry by the time this game comes out i will say that perfectly after they finish their survey work trainers we'll return to juba life to prepare for their next next task whenever trainers leave juba life city to to set out on an ex excu excu excursion excursion it was at the tip of my tongue their first stop will be one of the base camps that serve as an outpost for their work these base camps are more than just starting points trainers can stop and rest uh letting their team recover health or using a base camp work bench to craft items i do not care for this monster hunter garbage that was the body the opposite i was like oh i'm getting such a strong monster hunter vibe off visitors do not care for this monster hunter garbage in my pokemon game just wait until you try it greg you'll like it you'll like it as i i had too much crafting and animal crossing to as trainers progress towards completing look crafting is just like very now everybody likes to craft i know i know entire show about making it um i well like two three of the biggest games in the world fortnite roblox and minecraft all have crafting like it's not surprising uh as trainers progress towards completing the pokedex and increase in rank as a member of the galaxy team i have an issue they will meet interesting characters and encounter unique pokemon living in the houston region so first we have weird deer the big horned pokemon normal psychic stantler will evolve into weirder notice they use the word stantler so i don't think we're getting a unique stantler using the black orbs at its base of its antlers this pokemon will generate and unleash psychic energy powerful enough to dis distort space then we have basket legion the big fish pokemon it is water ghost basket legion in the history region will evolve baskelin in the history region will evolve into vasculation when they are possessed by the souls of other masculine from their school that could not withstand the harsh journey upstream so dark their power is bolstered by the souls possessing them letting them swim without tiring so two brand new pokemon we have the hissuian bravery which is a psychic flying when rufflet in the his region evolves so safe to say probably just normal rufflet they will become hisui and bravery bravery can imbued its eerie screeches with psychic power to generate the powerful shockwaves it can also use its psychic power to sharpen its sixth sense seeing dead people no wait that was a movie uh entering a trance that boasts its psychic abilities and then we have hissuian growlithe this growlithe appears in the his region his suing growleth has no has longer more voluminous fur previously discovered from the other form of growlithe highly vigilant they tend to be seen watching over their territories in pairs okay uh i think the new pokemon are a pretty big deal so let's put all gameplay and story things aside and let's focus on these four i have issues with the po well we know you have issues with the crafting we know you have issues with the weird storyline thing you got issues with these four pokemons yes okay let me hear them one i really wish some of them were more unique types that we didn't already have in the game like weird year not being normal ice and instead being normal psychic like budget giraffe rig like it's just it that already exists we have indeed we have drafted but you have to look at the balance of the pokemon that are in the game which we don't have the full range but still i think that that is a misstep same with basket legion water ghost we already have a water ghost whatever it's fine yeah but don't speak don't speak ill of vasculation this might be one of the greatest one of the greatest pokemon you cannot turn like this no no you're not allowed oh cool uh i same with same with all other types i was not wowed by the types i love their design my biggest issue is this is a game set in the past are you gonna bother to answer what happened to them yeah because they don't exist celebi and hoopa they had a weekend together that's all and they just said we're gonna zork these four pokemon into the future and suddenly what's gonna happen like the other thing is that we have the whole thing about this is putting together a pokedex and so we've never in the history of all the games that take place in the future have ever heard of these even though they were supposed to have been catalogued thousands of years ago it's going extinct it's an alternate universe as every daggon pokemon game has ever been it's in alternative questions it bothers me that they are introducing these in a game that is set in the past and they have not bothered to mention them they could not even answer why leon got lost all the time they couldn't even figure that out they were just like here's a characteristic it bother it i okay it's weird because i'm really excited i like all these designs i'm not thrilled about their typings but whatever i think all their designs are really amazing it just i'm like you chose the game set in the past set in a region that will become sinnoh and we've never ever ever heard of them before as a person that really sort of likes the lore and the timeline i am absolutely hoping there is somewhere that they answered the question what happened where did they go and why because otherwise their introduction will always bother me i don't know it doesn't bother me in the sense of like i mean it's so consistent with everything like oh we forgot this whole island of alola existed with all these other pokemon and we're just learning about it now i mean exploring new regions and not having cross-pollination is a thing that happens like unless they have a way to fly from an island or somebody deliberately brings another species in and then ruins the ecosystem by introducing a non-native species it is common to go to a region and say we've never explored beer here before and we learn new things we have explored this region before it's called diamond and pearl so here's a question been here for a long time did the let's go games have fairy type in them yeah yeah right but so how how did that magically happen they explained that each new console is its own universe they did that at the end of omega ruby alpha sapphire yeah yeah literally you were mad about anything it's a mega ruby off sapphire just throwing everything in the trash and being like everything is an alternate universe offered a reason why alternate universes exist for the consoles that they never said for the consoles they just said alternate universes i feel like in a world where you have one pokemon that can summon every legendary with hoops and you have one pokemon that can time travel and you have one pokemon that can control the flow of time and space but those are two pokemon like i feel like this is not that big in this region of all regions the time and space region all regions where they heavily talked about the lore and the history in the past throughout diamond and pearl they introduce not only does it have a new name that they've never talked about before but at least four new pokemon that we've never heard of before all i'm saying is there had better be at least a throw off line somewhere to explain what happens to these or it's going to bug me for ever i mean i would assume so i mean like the easy answer is like they went extinct or cyrus got his plan or their that this is an alternative timeline i'm sure there is i mean like i feel like they're making a big deal about how this was the central region and now as of three days ago they're making a big deal how this turns into this this is the sinnoh region but it wasn't so like i'm assuming that's what i'm saying part of the story is like how did how did it become cinno yeah if they don't answer that i'm going to be bothered i mean they need to explain what happened well that has to be the story right like how did this become cinno and it is team galaxy which yeah i mean obviously i want to talk about the characters will what do you think of these pokemon i mean i like them uh i think that they skillfully chose these ones to show no hms in this game that they particularly selected these ones to point that out and make that clear um i think the introduction of the braviary was real cool showing the character jump off the cliff and then it's like oh i'm actually hang gliding on a braviary i'm a little concerned that the bravery is a seasonal bird that might like you might not be able to access it in the summer if you ever get to summer in this game i don't know because it said it only comes in the winter oh but uh yeah i mean i i think they're all cute i i have no concerns with i mean i gave up on them re-editing which pokemons existed the world all locked terrific i threw in that towel the one thing that uh that that i want to point out is it's very possible i just want people to think about this it's very possible for that growlithe not to evolve into arcanine true correct i think everyone kind of jumped to the assumption that it's going to evolve into arcanine which is a fair assumption but when we live in a world where meowth evolves into berserker and yeah mass evolves into roonregus i think it might be it's like 50 50 at this point whether it's going to evolve yeah i mean it could involve could evolve into anything who knows uh which i think i i really think it evolving into something new is is more exciting than rk9 yeah well it depends if how cool the new arcanine looks and if if greg really cares about the lore and then the first pokemon episode where they look at four legendary pokemon and three of them are the birds and then the other one is arcanine it's like well and also like cinno is like no anime makes me mad anyways like i don't even be started cinno is known for like oh hey even though you've had these pokemon forever here's 16 pokemon evolutions that just they couldn't evolve in the other places it's just just over here yeah well believe me that bothers me so much i can't even explain how much that bugs me ah yeah it it doesn't bug me as much i guess but i i like new pokemon you you throw something too you throw some new pokemon in i'm in i i like how they introduce these pokemon i mean they open that trailer with weird deer and the light hits it in a way where you're like oh it's a stantler and then as it zooms in you're like wait a minute and then they they'd like to leave what i did they they come back to it like the trailer was actually really well done yeah i was like that's awesome and then it was like that stanler looks weird maybe it's like ancient stantler right yeah yeah um yeah and we'll will's right like it's obvious if you need to surf you jump on the basket legion if you need to fly you jump on the braver area if you need to just get around faster it doesn't look like there's a bike it looks like there's a stantler um yeah so it's a weird deer or yeah weird deer sorry it very much um doesn't seem like hms are here good uh okay let's talk about the characters um which i don't actually have in front of me but it's so obvious that the galac the galaxy expected expedition team is team galactic in some form um which people already speculated from the very first trailer that the logos were similar i i don't have thoughts like i guess i'm not i don't care i guess is where i'm coming from but like characters in this game look like characters in diamond and pearl yep uh what's her what's her name silene looks like she's related to cyrus yep with the hair and the facial features and they're heck they're both names start with c like i i i'm sure they're going for some sort of i mean it's diamond pearl the whole thing was time and space i'm sure they're going for something like that i don't know if i don't know if i would purchase this game because i would i was so invested in the the mediocre story that is diamond and pearl that i need to know what happened before that like i just don't care that much in that sense and greg's gonna say it's because you don't like story that's not true it is true it's not it's not don't don't give me a game with a mediocre story and say like well you don't appreciate this mediocre story like no pokemon game has a good enough story that is like worth like i would never tell somebody hey go pick up diamond go pick up black and white you're going to love that story like no they're going to get to the part where you're in the ferris wheel with n and be like what am i playing what is this because you haven't been paying attention because you don't like the story if you've been paying attention you wouldn't know why that's an important part lore of those games are different than the story and the lore and pokemon games are good the the garbage mediocre you must save the world stories are not worth buying for 40 or whatever they are they're just not worth it like like the pokemon company is so good at putting all these pieces together and making you immersed in a world and making you care about pokemon and why the pokemon exists and why these towns exist but the story to story beats and pokemon games are mediocre and they always have been even in pokemon they couldn't do it they're like here is uncle wallace care about this guy oh you found xerneas at the end of pokemon snap we'll never mention uncle charles again or whatever his name was they're talking about the commander that got lost yeah char spoilers there is nothing memorable about the diamond and pearly's pearl storyline captain vince that's it there's nothing memorable about the diamond and pearl storyline that isn't in another game cyrus wants to create a new world you save the world you beat a gym leaders the game is over i mean if you break down every story that way yeah it sounds boring but the lore and the learning of the world is part of the story well i'm not saying the lore or the worlds are bad i think the world building in pokemon is very good i agree i think the lore is very good i think the story beats are bad i don't think they're separate from the story anything x and y has better story beats because at least you remember you have to battle pitbull before you battle lysander with a virtual boy on his face like at least you'll remember that i mean that's character design that's not story i mean because you don't con like you have such a weird division of how you divide things out in your brain that i cannot comprehend it's like the story of harry potter yeah it's boring a kid finds out that he's special and saves the world it's the pokemon story if you include nothing else about that world star wars a kid finds out he's special and saves the universe because nothing else about that world matters it's just a boring retold story that is you right now there are plenty of games where i like the story gone home fire watch yeah they're no longer those are like all emotional feely stories i mean they're all if you break them down to the way you're doing it now you can say these are the same boring tropes that we hear in every other game yeah that is how a lot of stories and video games work i would i would always put a video game story on the sense of if you are playing a game and somebody on like somebody sitting next to you on the couch can get that same amount of enjoyment by watching you play and is invest in the story i would argue that that is a good story and there are plenty of games that do that that exist um like the god of war game had a brilliant story it was very easy for somebody to sit on the couch and be invested the uncharted games do this the last of us does this um the games i mentioned earlier do that i just there's never there's not a situation where two people are sitting on the couch and like my wife is looking over my shoulder being like oh man i can't wha what is barry going to do next no one cares no one cares people do care a lot of people care just because you don't doesn't mean people don't no one is like man i really want to see that like that again there are okay story beats in sword and shield like when hop uh changes his team and when hop gets really upset with beat like a bead like there are some great story moments in a lot of the games there's a lot of great stuff in sun and moon there's a lot of great stuff in all of them yeah they're they the i think the thing is they get so close of almost doing it right and then they give you a 20-minute elevator battle with horrible music and they're like well we don't know how to finish this game but yeah battle mega gardover dynamics gardener got gigantic garb odor yeah they they they're so upset they get so many things like almost there and then they drop the ball but that's every pokemon game that's like 90 percent of our media no i think there are games that that that could be there's like 10 of games that are absolutely stellar but most of the stuff that we do is re-tread stuff look it can't all be mass effect it can't all be bioshock one you're right it can't i i don't know if i care enough about [Music] i hope the game convinces me i hope the game has good story hooks where i'm like i need to know how this girl is related to cyrus all right let's talk about the real problematic problem and they're really cool shoes in this game they don't have shoes they just have socks with sandals i know it's horrible toes are freezing just watching it a thousand years ago why is the professor still wearing a white coat that that's not right yeah and also we're assuming lavenden is based off of lavender like is that the tree we're going for or is this before all professors were named after trees for some reason i greg as the story connoisseur let me hear it you see the professor you see the cyrus is probably relative what are you thinking in what way does it make you excited or like i mean so the fact that they are drawing direct paralyzed parallels like this has me excited but also makes me frustrated about introducing new pokemon because i don't know if they're going like i don't know how they're connecting these dots so i have hope because they are clearly like even in the in even in the web page they're like you'll notice that commander komodo is pretty much rowan uh they're the same character model like this is a direct line that we're drawing and so it makes me excited to know that they are going to spend time exploring and hopefully telling the story of what happens to all of these things my fear is that they will leave things off the table like explaining what happens to these pokemon or where they where they went or or what happens um i'm excited that they are drawing these direct lines i'm excited that they're saying hey this is juba life village and then it becomes jupiter life city hey this is commander komodo and then in the future it's professor rowan and i'm curious if they're going to do a thing where they're like and these are the same people because of a time warp whatever like like i'm curious where they're going with it but it does make me excited to sort of figure out what they're doing with the story in this game and i'm trying to figure out like you can draw a direct parallel between uh celine and kamado i'm struggling with who the direct line for professor levington is yeah they say on the website commander komodo who appears in legends archaeologists is the ancestor of rowan who appears in diamond of pearl it seems that other people from the game might also be ancestors to familiar faces they know right so i'm still trying to look at professor lavinton and figure out it's like does he look like barry does he i mean he has a cool poliwhirl hat that's pretty sweet yeah like which again this is like this these are the things they're like really good at they're really good at like incorporating pokemon subtly into the world that once you realize it you're like man that's really clever that's really cool like oh you like you could have just put any hat on him or just give him hair but like you put effort into making like a poly world hat which probably has something to do with his personality or whatever yeah i love the art style i like the art style but i think graphically this game looks awful uh would you do you tree people stop it looks bad you can't sit here and tell me this game these games look graphically good six months in six months it'll they will six months i hope it looks great but pull it up to screenshots of sword and shield doesn't even compare it makes sword and shield look like the trees are are are emmy women and like award-winning trees this is our our our misty uh watercolor past of memory like like it's like like i think graphically these games look like garbage do i think the entire game looks bad no i think the game looks fun but like people are making jokes that like the game looked like a nintendo 64 game and i was like you're out of your mind stop exaggerating and then i pulled up nintendo 64 games and i was like holy cow you're actually kind of right like it is actually bad how how the water looks and how the grass looks and how the ground looks like compare like pull up nintendo 64 games like there are moments in ocarina of time where it looks better than the screenshot of that basket legion in the world it's an artistic choice you just don't like this art style link link me what you're looking at i'm not gonna link it on the podcast you just like look up look up like like look at the pictures i tweeted like i thought people were exaggerating and then i pulled up nintendo 64 games and i was like you're kind of right it's it's just there's a thought that if it's not like sharp high quality high definition graphics it's not good and i i just don't think that that is no i think i think there is a thought that hey you've made games for 25 years how does this game look worse than the last like six games you've made like they're not a new developer but you're saying i i don't think it looks worse i think it looks different i think it's a different art style you didn't tweet something did you i didn't tweet a side by side but like but graphically they look bad they look awful we'll see when the game is actually i mean yeah you're right there's like there's six months more polish is usually the last thing we've had this conversation for sword and shield like sword and shield look really they looked really rough and when they came out they they looked better but sword and shield still looked worse than breath of the wild and breath of the wild came out three years earlier again different teams i understand i get it um how did i never notice the gallerian wheezing on this factory building i tweeted that too well i'm looking at it because i was looking to see if you did your look at these two things together because i'm going to argue about it because i'm looking at nintendo 64. and those games look bad like they don't look they don't look bad they look way worse than what i'm seeing for screenshots here probably this this these set of pictures right here are probably the worst the basket legion in the water the like gastrodon on this beach against this lucario looks absolutely atrocious minus the menus the menus look really really good i mean they look rough yeah they look really bad yeah but we know the polish i mean they don't they they look rough they look unfinished at the end of the day they literally look unfinished this is what i will say at the end of the day i don't care as long as the game is fun as long as the game is good that's all that matters and that's that's a lot that is very much coming from like somebody who is like a nintendo fan like you don't buy a nintendo console because you want pc graphic qualities you don't buy you don't like come to super mario and you're like man i wish super mario looked better you just super mario plays good it's fun it's enjoyable like all that stuff at the end of the day i really don't care about graphics as long as the game is good right like if i cared about graphics i would i would not own a ps4 or an xbox whatever i would buy all my games on pc i would have the world's greatest graphics card i'll have water cooling jet and it will look incredible but i think it is fair to say you are the most profitable video company that makes the like the most money through merch and through cards and through that your last game sold 21 million copies and your game doesn't even look as good as a launch game on the nintendo switch from five years ago like how are you gonna sit here and be like oh well the who like come on it's not like it's not like they haven't been making video games for 30-some years how have they not figured this out yet like as much as we make fun of the trees and sword and shield yeah they don't matter but also how like how did they just not fix that was there would they not just have like they don't have an artist that can't make their own custom tree texture to apply to the tree to make it look slightly better i'm not going to worry about it not until i see this everybody says like breath of the wild looks so great and like i don't know what they're judging that off of like i really don't they look like completely different art styles but yeah but the arts the style you are going for is different than the graphics itself like yeah but we just said earlier let's go pikachu diamond and pearl sword and shield and legends they all have different styles yeah but i don't think the graphics look different from each other you don't think this baskeline in the water by itself doesn't look absolutely awful i mean i think it looks unfinished yeah it looks unfinished like if you were gonna say hold up sword and shield and hold up breath of wild and breath of wild looks so much better i don't see that i don't see what people are saying that breath of wild looks so much better than sword and shield does graphically i don't see it i don't see how what you're comparing this is an audio podcast so we can't really spend too much time looking at breath of the wild pictures and i don't see what you're comparing like i'm seeing two vastly different art styles but i'm not saying i'm not seeing graphically how one is graphically superior i think if if pokemon games didn't sell so incredibly well i don't think people would care as much so i would put it differently i think if they're they didn't sell as well they wouldn't put an unfinished product in front of people but with the sales that they know that they're going to get they can feel confident putting an unfinished product in front of people knowing that that's not really going to lose them any sales a lot of game developers change their game tons of times before it comes out and we have a long time before this game comes out true but yeah if they had done this pokemon presents and didn't show any pokemon arceus legends pokemon legends arceus that that would have been that would have been a bad discussion yeah that would have been like coveted killed it it's it's going to be delayed it's not going to come out bad news yeah but in a sense though they're i mean they're controlling what they're showing yeah and they like the screenshots i tweeted were official screenshots that they provided press and i look at these screenshots and i'm like you couldn't you can get us better what like this is the best you got the one thing that stands out to me is it in the in the screenshots i tweeted if you look at the menu it's the one with this it's the one with the the wheezing on the building like the menu looks polished and good yeah i mean yeah it's a menu but it looks very crisp very clean it almost looks like it's from a different game compared to like the lan the standard picture of weird deer here with like this like paper craft tree behind it again i i don't really care about graphics i play tooth don't roll like i don't know why you're rolling your eyes i put 2 000 hours into ultrasound ultra moon on the 3ds you want to talk about something that looks like absolute but it's literally every three days because you're the person that constantly brings this up and then you're the person that constantly says i don't care about this we never bring up your graphic concerns we never bring up your stuff you are the one that goes out there expectations i think i don't care about graphics when you clearly do care about graphics graphics don't impact your enjoyment but you base things off of graphics like you can't say i don't care about it and then have spent this entire time talking about how crappy they look i think it would be a disservice to all our listeners to ignore the fact that these games look awful they don't look awful they look awful they look awful i don't know how you can sit here and say the switch has been out for five years and be like yep this is acceptable like they look bad they look visually bad i don't know i like their service really like lots of kiting through like super mario odyssey like there are so many games that have existed on the switch that blows these out of the water i and it would be a disservice if we suck here that big of a deal i am not seeing what you are saying is so graphically graphically not art style graphically different between these games okay i i think they i think they look like garbage graphically i and i've said on this podcast before i don't think game freak is the world's best developer far from it no they're not they're not they never have been play let's go pikachu let's go eevee where you can barely like it's surprisingly that you're surprising that your character can walk around properly because it gets stuck on every sign and every person too close together like i i am um well aware that they are they are not the best developer and to go back to the breath of the wild thing monolith software helped that nintendo team that worked on breath of the wild with the map design and and a lot of in a lot of what breath of the wild does and i think people wouldn't care as much if pokemon wasn't the money-making machine that they are they make so much money i i don't they literally sold 21 million copies i don't i don't know if people like if i don't know that fans of any game like you aren't hearing from the 20 million people that bought that game you're hearing from the one million people who are invested but in a situation where it bothers them it's it's hard to look at it's hard to look at pokemon and be like you make millions and millions of dollars why do your games look like garbage that's just not where they're investing their i know that's not where they're investing look half the people that probably complain about graphics they probably jump on the internet smash their keyboard a bunch of times as a complaint and then they go over and they play roblox roblox also looks like garbage minecraft looks good but it's also like a giant pixelated roblox though yeah like i would say they don't look like garbage because that's the art style they're going for roblox i think i've never played bad blocks i think it looks awful looks like legos yeah it looks like legos but yeah i mean like there's a huge difference between minecraft and gears of war correct two different art styles what even is roblox it's like minecraft the thing about roblox is you can make things for roblox you can make games inside of roblox and then you can sell those games so roblox makes a ton of money because it like at its core it's a platform but inside it's like i can buy a pokemon game inside roblox that's not called pokemon it's called pokey bros it's very very popular i'm trying to actually find an actual screenshot of this game and it's incredibly difficult because there's just a lot of banners they gotta make their money do you wanna talk about the crafting i mean there's crafting and i don't understand why but sure well going back to roblox and minecraft and all these other games i mean i wanted it's what i asked for in a pokemon game so i got what i wanted because you're crafting pokeballs yeah they they showed crafting they showed that the characters could actually get hit and take damage yeah you get attacked um they showed that there was like a strong style and an agile style which to me the first thing when when they showed that i was like oh they really run in with this hershey food gimmick i eh that is an old that is an old advancement of turn style combat that has that they're like adopting for this that certain moves will will move you higher up in the initiative order like this was this is the thing that i've run into final fantasy tactics that i'm like okay so they're they're finally including this in their turn-based system to make it more action based it's not not like a sudden new development it's interesting i mean i'm curious how it changes things the idea that the moves you pick would allow you to go more times before a slower opponent that picked a heavier move i mean it's an interesting thing to add it does make it slightly more actiony i'm interested to see if it actually is fun to do yeah the other thing is like the whole point of the game is to complete the pokedex the world's first pokedex or whatever they called it um they show they have like a screenshot of like research tests for shinx and it's um catch one catch two four ten fifteen pokemon um and then it shows they they caught three shanks and it says number of shanks defeated one two four ten fifteen so it this part kind of reminded me of pokemon snap yep um where it was like i did feel that do these tasks over and over again go back like number four and do these things in this region number forms you registered like probably male female um so like that looked cool and that seems to have like some replayability i would assume that you probably don't need to do all 15 or 25 for each one number of times you've seen bite i don't know if you need to see 25 bytes in order to like 100 the game i'm not big on crafting but i don't know i guess it'll be fine like i wasn't big on crafting when they announced it for animal crossing and then in animal crossing it was like okay it was okay i did some of it but it wasn't super it gets it sort of gets annoying when you have a ton of recipes you're like okay what do i need for this one again and then you're like okay i only have seven of those so i have to go out and find them and then halfway through i've forgotten uh it depends on how they sort of organize crafting how complicated it gets like crafting in games is not not my favorite thing it's fine i'll do it but that there's never been a crafting mechanic that i've been like i can't wait to craft nothing in final fantasy 14 you don't like though i hate crafting i hate making clothes i hate it all i hate the crafting system and final fantasy 14 so much it it yeah i do not like it i hate it it's not great what was the other thing uh they showed different outfits so character customization although i don't think they showed in color did show different outfit um there's a pre-order bonus of heavy balls which is funny because they show a screenshot of a heavy ball being thrown out of starly yeah not heavy uh the one thing i did notice on the outside this will probably change i'm sure but the pre-order also gives you the growl of kimono the outfit yeah um they have like a minus button that looks to be like an it either looks like an iphone or an egg incubator i can't tell and then the up button looks to be your menu because there's like a pokeball uh profile and then uh apricorn or something and then the bottom one is like a journal so i would assume that's like your pokedex yeah uh and then they have this monster hunter like menu on the right hand side of like i'm assuming flipping through your pokeballs or maybe summoning your pokemon so yeah the cell phone does look like a weird incubator but it could be also like if you have if it's like a pokemon box and in the reason you can only catch up to 30 like a snap is it could be a box because you see how there's three dots yeah they have three pokemon and not six you can only fill up so much and then you have to go back to base camp because you have no more space like i could see that kind of like how they did for snap like well you took 30 pictures you're halfway through the route so we're going to pull you back because you're out of film i could see that being up you're out of space because it does i don't think there's going to be like a pc type situation because it's in the past i don't know hoopa threw a pc through the portal it landed but you blame everything on hoopa i feel like you can at this place koopa can't do everything that they haven't really said that hoopa can do time travel that's why celebi helps the hoop at a time travel then he sets up the ring yeah but hoop like hoopa can only set up rings in space so you travel back in time hoopa can do what with that maybe hoopa sets up the ring and then celebi pulls something from the past and then throws it through the ring i don't know and you're gonna complain about story and that's the best you can come up with i'm not a story writer i'm just here to complain this is the the most true statement i'm just here to complain they did not use the words open world once again nope we are eight months into this game they have never mentioned wrote down or tweeted the words open world although they did show the overall of the map and it was broken into sections so i think will is correct that this is more monster hunter than we think and that you will go back to a base camp jubalife and you will pick different areas to go to specifically um it if it's if it's open world cool if it's not open world i don't think this is that big of a deal like i wouldn't consider sword and shield open world games but exploring all of the crown tundra exploring all of the isle of armor that's fine it's fun it's good i don't need to go from the crown tundra through pots wick or whatever it's called post wick like i'll just fly to it it's fine like open world is such a generic throwaway term at this point theoretically technically once you beat a pokemon game you can go wherever you want you can walk from the eighth gym to the first gym if you really wanted to i don't know it looks good it looks fine i have a little bit i'm very excited for the game i think i i i there's enough very new things in the game that i'm like i want to see how they work i don't know if i'm going to like it but i mean yeah that's how i feel like it when i think of action rpgs i always think of like devil my cry or bayonetta or even like the new god of wars very action rpg like literally every game at this point's an rpg every every video game that comes out there's like level up systems and power ups and skill trees uh and i'm not a huge fan of those games personally you know what these what this reminds me of the entire time i was watching it it reminded me of like final fantasy 15. like somebody at game freak finally played uh like somebody i gave like the people at game freak grew up with final fantasy and they were like ah turn-based rpgs and then they were like wait a minute after final fantasy 10 they stopped doing turn-based and there's no action maybe we should do that uh not good and i love final fantasy 15. it's one of my favorite games i know bad story i mean to play it was awful a bad story in that game too but the lore and everything was fine uh but i hated the combat in 15. but i sludged through it anyways because everything else about that game was good uh but i personally like turn-based stuff i like turn-based stuff a lot obviously i prefer it myself so by removing the turn base i have hesitations but i mean i'll try it i mean it's hard to say how much of the turn base is gone because it's still clearly one one one one unless you pick a style that will go two two one but like the amount of real time decisions you have to make like it didn't i didn't get the sense like the game doesn't pause for you to choose a move and choose a style it it felt very much to me like the battle stops when you're picking your move you choose between the two and then it loads up the thing and you can continue down that path at any time you can pause the combat to change it again so i don't know how real timey it will actually feel that's um i don't know if you either of you played bravely default no i have played bravia default but it like bravely default was it's turn based but it's kind of not because you can you can commit all your moves up front um so like you can use what's called your you can brave so you can say like i'm gonna attack one two three four and then because i'm faster than my opponent i'm going to do all four turns first and then if they're dead and they can't attack then the battle's over on i1 um so you do one two three four and then they survive and then if they can just attack and then it's their turn again and then you're you you braved so you can't do anything so they attack again um or you can default where you can save your turns so you can save up for a bigger move so the agile slash strong seemed very much like that strong style and agile i don't know i i i feel like i don't really have any questions about diamond pearl they showed it and i was like yep that's exactly what it is i mean i have questions about like the hideaway yeah and like the more details and obviously like how the bases will work and how they affect the hideaway and um yeah yeah or like is there gonna be more clothing like what's the pokedex looking like that kind of stuff but like none of those questions i feel like are questions that are like well if they don't have six outfits i'm not buying the game it's like like i like i i am genuinely curious about the pokedex but it's not going to stop me from buying the game like it looks good with arceus i'm just like i feel like you gave me way more questions and i still don't know what this game is fully doing good they they succeeded because now you're curious yeah i am i'm also i i like past past the game itself i'm curious for sales like when you look at sword and shield it sold 21 million but there's two copies of that game when you look at sun and moon they sold 16 million again two copies of that game like why did why did they not do two copies why is it only one like it's game freak they could have easily been like this is the old-fashioned arceus and this is slightly western arch like they could have just put any subtitle on and sell two versions of this game if they wanted to we'll see it's kind of weird that they're like so does one copy of arceus sell 10 million does one copy of arceus sell 8 million does it only sell 2 million like should have they should they have put 2 out i mean i think the thing that we don't know is how many of the two million or how many of like the 21 million of sword and shield are people buying both copies right right like we don't know what that percentage is we know our audience the people who listen to the podcast we know a lot of them buy two copies because they're listening to a pokemon but we are a fraction of a percent of people uh so it's hard to say it's hard to speculate what a completely different style game where there's only one of them cells like the closest parallel we could get are things like pokemon conquest which or i was gonna say coliseum or gale of darkness or calcium or gala darkness where it is a different game style and it is a one-off only game and we could maybe draw some parallels but i mean we're just really guessing at that point like these didn't sell great but they sold good enough and gale of darkness and coliseum didn't really i mean i think they i think they stole two to three million respectively but also there wasn't that many game cubes compared to that many switches there are a lot of switches out there yeah a lot more than gamecube i mean gamecube had a handle but the switch is very very popular anyways uh i think that's it was there anything we missed from the trailers uh i'm trying to see how much conquest sold and that's not easy uh they put out that nintendo switch dialga palkia edition that's coming out november 5th i'd be more interested if it was the led model yeah yeah i i was like oh a new switch oh it's a switch light meaning i am not going to buy it uh conquest apparently sold 341 000 copies in japan geez not a lot i don't think conquest sold very well i think part of the reason why conquest got hurt is because it was one of the last ds games when a 3ds came out yeah still a fun game though i like conquest a whole lot is there anything i'm looking at this list i can't believe chat is in pokemon legends arcus finally how many pokemon you think are gaming legends uh i would say 300. i'd say between 300 and 400 yeah i'm gonna say 300 as well because i think like things like rotom are not going to be in that game no you wrote tom's how you got the pc there's no pc i i have no backwards there's no motor there may maybe they'll introduce the who he suing rotom form which is a steam engine i still think they're the reason these games are too close so close together is there's going to be like this opens up an area in each other's games if it reads your data and it's probably um i also have a suspicion that pokemon legends arceus is going to be a like move to maybe more chapter based gaming and then maybe the next uh installment is also based in the past and it takes you through a continuing story of how all the history and growth go extinct yes uh yeah i get very let's go pikachu let's go eevee vibes from this where it's like we took a small team we needed to make something this is a project but only time will tell most of the team is on gen 9. uh yeah i mean probably i don't know it depends on how big the game is like i can't make that determination if it's a 20-hour game if it's a 10-hour game it's a 50-hour game yeah i don't know like it's hard to say how much of it is scripted driven how much of it is once you're in those regions you have a lot of time and space to explore like there are just way too many questions at this point about arceus um like i like i have no idea where they're going with it i like what they've showed though yeah i mean at least they've done the one thing that they probably wanted to do which was to get people who are tired of the same pokemon formula interested in this yeah i'm not tired of the old pokemon either clearly i like it a lot and you know coming out every couple years i mean big big games like i'm that it always scratches that itch but but you look you look at series like final fantasy i mean the first six final fantasies are pretty similar and then seven was when that big change was and they took that until ten and then eleven they throw that out the window and they're like here's an mmo it's different than the past and then twelve was completely different here's the mmo combat system that didn't work in 11 and it doesn't work in 12. and then 13 was like here's just a 20-hour tutorial good luck yeah and then 14 was like here's an mmo again here's an mmo that's so bad we're gonna blow it up and start over again which is what they did and then 15 was like here's an open world final fantasy game where the open world doesn't actually matter and you're better off just going from story beat to story beat because otherwise you're walking in a desert for 20 hours there's nothing to do i like 15 a lot that game has problems one of them being its open world but then you look at other series like resident evil the first three resident evils are its own thing when resident evil 4 came out it dramatically changed how that game played and how that game felt and they kept that until seven and seven and nine are completely different rest in evil games but they're all resident evil games so i don't buy into this like well it's not a real pokemon game if it's not whatever they've been doing like they have tried plenty of new things over the years and they've always fallen back on eight gyms three starters go on your journey and that works and obviously it works very well they sold 21 million copies of certain shield like there's not a part of me that thinks they're never going to get away from that completely but i'm glad they're trying something new yeah i mean they took a big risk with let's go and they put pokemon in the overworld and that paid off and it seems like they're they're staying with that good um so i'm excited even if arceus comes out and it's a flop and ign gives it a three out of ten and game informer gives it a two out of five or whatever they're like i am still glad they tried something new yes and worst case scenario if the bad game the music in that trailer very good they won't release that on a cd for you i'm sorry uh well pokemon of the week uh so last week's pokemon um it basically had two clues although i think there's one something about things being quickly and easily forgotten first part of its name uh kind of similar to a name that people applied to another pokemon from the same region release of regional decks the second part of its name is from one of its physical features which is also a physical feature of aquatic animals technically that's the term for it um but there's only one other in that region there's only one pokemon evolutionary line that would also have that feature wasn't that hard it's munchlax yeah no oh it's trumpeek yes correct your trivia should have been what shining what was irene's first shiny pokemon in sun and moon but evolution are they available in the wild can you catch yeah it's uh right before mallow's trial yeah in the in that forest area it is uh shuffle icon is excellent trumpy actually uh very good metal middle evolution yeah it really it's not something is a good middle evolution uh red wood i'd like to have a word with you reboot is ugly what dumb it's cause he's wearing a hoodie and you hate hoodies no i love hoodies i hate hoodies it's wearing it's got something pulled up over its mouth it's got it's got a collar zipped up and it suddenly has pockets in its stomach it's a little weird uh trumpet beak yeah there's not a lot of trivia here they have pickup they are the only pokemon with pickup as their hidden ability really interesting is that that'll be on a trivia quiz you're gonna be at a bar this weekend which good thing i listened to this week's ise would have never gotten that right so i went and looked at the shuffle icon for two canon and it is so superior to every other shuffle icon it's so angry i love it buchanan is the master of the side eye yo hardcore toucannon had a good pokemon snap representation liz trump even in snap isn't it just pika pak and yeah it was no no trump beacons yeah no love for the middle evolution there geez uh will what about next week all right it's a sinnoh celebration except not two weeks ago we featured a so-called middle evolution that received a new final evolution in the diamond and pearl games even though it already had an existing subsequent evolution it turns out that there are several pokemon that received an additional evolution in diamond and pearl that they did not have this week's pokemon is one of those i hope i got that right i'd be wrong i don't know beginning with where they appear in the national pokedex we have new evolutions that are dark ice electric steel normal ground rock grass electric fire fairy flying bug flying grass ice ground flying ice ground normal psychic fighting rock steel ghost and ice ghost this week's pokemon does not evolve while knowing a particular move it does not evolve while being exposed to a particular held item no special location required it does not it doesn't have to level up holding a particular item at night there is one other form of evolution that remains and that is how this week's pokemon evolves you need a friend and you need something imbued with horrifyingly strong spiritual energy i mean that's a lot of words but it's not that hard all right well hopefully you enjoyed this really long episode we had a lot to cover uh i'm sure if you're in the discord or the slack uh you'll have your own opinions on what was discussed today i always get excited i get excited monday morning to wake up and then see what was
