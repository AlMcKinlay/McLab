what's up everyone welcome to a mini (0:24 - 0:29)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:27 - 0:31)
super effective not to be confused with (0:29 - 0:33)
a mini series which will start next week (0:31 - 0:34)
this is just uh we want to get something (0:33 - 0:37)
out here first impressions it's been a (0:34 - 0:39)
full day since scarlet and violet have (0:37 - 0:42)
released I'm your host Steve Greg is (0:39 - 0:46)
here hello hello hello uh (0:42 - 0:48)
uh (0:46 - 0:52)
I am wandering this incredible space (0:48 - 0:55)
called paldea I am (0:52 - 0:59)
very lost the map is not helping me I (0:55 - 1:00)
put things on the map and I'm like I (0:59 - 1:03)
have no way I have no idea where I am (1:00 - 1:06)
it's a big mess at any time (1:03 - 1:08)
that I spent (1:06 - 1:12)
I kid you not 45 minutes in a series of (1:08 - 1:15)
canyons and I kept thinking (1:12 - 1:18)
have I been here already (1:15 - 1:18)
Fair yep what what this looks different (1:19 - 1:28)
no I've been here now I'm in a dead end (1:24 - 1:30)
turn around (1:28 - 1:33)
speaking of being here Bobby is here (1:30 - 1:35)
I am right on the same page as Greg (1:33 - 1:38)
though like I just immediately lost but (1:35 - 1:39)
I'm like oh this is fun oh I have no (1:38 - 1:41)
idea where I am now I took a left turn (1:39 - 1:44)
and no clue where I am (1:41 - 1:47)
uh yeah so so here's the deal I posted (1:44 - 1:48)
this on the patreon (1:47 - 1:51)
um uh which if if you want to support we (1:48 - 1:53)
need like four more people to hit 600 (1:51 - 1:54)
patrons which is our all-time high (1:53 - 1:56)
patreon.com (1:54 - 1:58)
pkmncst but I posted a free update (1:56 - 2:00)
anyone could read it it's pretty much (1:58 - 2:02)
just the schedule for um the remainder (2:00 - 2:05)
of the year which is this bonus episode (2:02 - 2:07)
for First Impressions and then every (2:05 - 2:09)
Monday until the rest of the year we're (2:07 - 2:11)
still doing normal podcasts uh those (2:09 - 2:12)
will still be news based they might (2:11 - 2:14)
include scarlet and violet they might (2:12 - 2:16)
include Pokemon go Masters unite (2:14 - 2:18)
everything else that normally we see in (2:16 - 2:19)
news obviously for the next couple (2:18 - 2:20)
months it's probably gonna be pretty (2:19 - 2:23)
scarlet and heavy focused (2:20 - 2:25)
um but we're not going to do any (2:23 - 2:27)
spoilers in in those news podcasts so (2:25 - 2:29)
those are still free safe to Listen to (2:27 - 2:31)
If there is something where we think it (2:29 - 2:34)
might be spoilery uh we'll give a full (2:31 - 2:38)
disclaimer always obviously uh then (2:34 - 2:40)
on the flip side we are going to do a (2:38 - 2:41)
mini series and Greg and I talked about (2:40 - 2:44)
this for hours of like how we're going (2:41 - 2:46)
to do this because if Greg wants to go (2:44 - 2:48)
to gyms and I want to do Titans and then (2:46 - 2:49)
Greg talks about gyms and I talk about (2:48 - 2:51)
Titans are we ruining that experience (2:49 - 2:53)
for each other is Greg going left am I (2:51 - 2:56)
going right is Bobby going south like (2:53 - 2:59)
it's it's so much so I think (2:56 - 3:01)
um we are going to do a mini-series uh (2:59 - 3:04)
that should come out next Thursday uh (3:01 - 3:05)
and then next Friday so there will be (3:04 - 3:07)
two and then the following Thursday and (3:05 - 3:08)
Friday so pretty much too many series (3:07 - 3:11)
every week for probably two or three (3:08 - 3:14)
weeks maybe four or six episodes (3:11 - 3:17)
um and I think just being in this game (3:14 - 3:20)
for a little bit longer than uh 24 hours (3:17 - 3:22)
is kind of what we need to try to (3:20 - 3:25)
structure some sort of mini-series so (3:22 - 3:26)
that's still coming (3:25 - 3:29)
um and all the episodes are going to be (3:26 - 3:31)
free nothing behind a paywall there (3:29 - 3:33)
probably there will be ads of course (3:31 - 3:34)
because we do have our ad deals for (3:33 - 3:35)
every Monday (3:34 - 3:37)
um we did make an ad deal for the mini (3:35 - 3:38)
episode so that's really exciting that (3:37 - 3:40)
we were able to secure that but you know (3:38 - 3:41)
if your Apple podcast or your Patron (3:40 - 3:43)
you're not going to hear any ads anyways (3:41 - 3:47)
so anyways all the house cleaning (3:43 - 3:50)
housekeeping oh housekeeping I thought I (3:47 - 3:52)
got it right this way no you never get (3:50 - 3:55)
it right go with what your impulse is (3:52 - 3:57)
and then do the other that was my (3:55 - 4:00)
impulse (3:57 - 4:00)
I thought that was right (4:00 - 4:04)
um so this episode is just First (4:05 - 4:08)
Impressions We're not gonna do any story (4:06 - 4:11)
story stuff here as well (4:08 - 4:12)
um (4:11 - 4:14)
I think I put 12 hours in the game where (4:12 - 4:17)
are you at Greg how many hours (4:14 - 4:17)
I want to say (4:18 - 4:23)
because because the target God's blessed (4:20 - 4:26)
to be for some unknown reason I got the (4:23 - 4:28)
game early (4:26 - 4:31)
and so I think I'm up to 20 hours (4:28 - 4:33)
because I played (4:31 - 4:37)
wow all night Thursday (4:33 - 4:37)
all this morning (4:37 - 4:43)
and some this afternoon so yeah I (4:40 - 4:44)
probably put in about (4:43 - 4:46)
well probably about 15 I would say 15 (4:44 - 4:49)
hours okay and uh Bobby where are you at (4:46 - 4:52)
not 15 hours (4:49 - 4:54)
I played a little bit last night and (4:52 - 4:57)
then I played today uh I'm a little over (4:54 - 4:59)
two hours in oh okay wow so you're (4:57 - 5:02)
probably still in tutorial (4:59 - 5:04)
um out of tutorial but I um you ran (5:02 - 5:06)
through tutorial fast then yeah I kind (5:04 - 5:08)
of did but then then had some fun after (5:06 - 5:11)
that so not too much further than that (5:08 - 5:14)
okay uh Greg hit me with your favorite (5:11 - 5:16)
thing so far in paldea what do we got (5:14 - 5:18)
here what what is what is the standout (5:16 - 5:21)
thing in this game that that is your (5:18 - 5:23)
first impression (5:21 - 5:28)
it's so pretty and vibrant and alive (5:23 - 5:30)
it (5:28 - 5:34)
everywhere I go I'm like (5:30 - 5:37)
this feels alive (5:34 - 5:41)
this feels full this feels like a world (5:37 - 5:43)
yeah and (5:41 - 5:43)
like I'm excited to go to new areas and (5:44 - 5:50)
every area although some areas aren't (5:47 - 5:52)
like (5:50 - 5:54)
Arceus had the monotone color problem (5:52 - 5:56)
and there are some areas in here that (5:54 - 6:00)
I'm like oh this is clearly a farming (5:56 - 6:02)
area or like (6:00 - 6:04)
you know it is definitely one type of (6:02 - 6:07)
grass but even in that one type of grass (6:04 - 6:11)
there is so much variation that I'm just (6:07 - 6:14)
I'm impressed at how (6:11 - 6:18)
huge and wonderful and (6:14 - 6:22)
alive the outdoors feel and only going (6:18 - 6:24)
to say the outdoors because I got big (6:22 - 6:26)
issues with the cities (6:24 - 6:28)
laughs (6:26 - 6:30)
uh Bobby what about you what is what is (6:28 - 6:33)
the the the good first impression (6:30 - 6:34)
standing out (6:33 - 6:36)
honestly I mean Greg you kind of took (6:34 - 6:38)
the words out of my mouth like uh it's (6:36 - 6:40)
so much more again like coming from (6:38 - 6:42)
Legends right it's so much more colorful (6:40 - 6:45)
there's just it's like and then so I (6:42 - 6:46)
played a little bit on my TV but I (6:45 - 6:48)
played mostly on the switch I have the (6:46 - 6:50)
switch OLED and it's like it's just (6:48 - 6:52)
beautiful how like how colorful have I (6:50 - 6:53)
went like you said it is (6:52 - 6:54)
um (6:53 - 6:56)
I really liked (6:54 - 6:58)
um I was expecting it to feel a little (6:56 - 7:01)
more empty than it is as well so like (6:58 - 7:03)
you know you run into one area and you (7:01 - 7:06)
see just a variety of Pokemon (7:03 - 7:07)
and then (7:06 - 7:09)
um you run into another area and it's (7:07 - 7:10)
like yeah you see some of the same stuff (7:09 - 7:11)
but then there's new things popping up (7:10 - 7:14)
there's like different uh ways that (7:11 - 7:17)
Pokemon like whether it's like um flying (7:14 - 7:20)
or on the ground but like you'll either (7:17 - 7:23)
see a Pokemon you can see them flying or (7:20 - 7:24)
you can see them like a flying Pokemon (7:23 - 7:26)
standing on the on the grass or (7:24 - 7:27)
something and it's and it's like oh (7:26 - 7:28)
that's so cool because you know I've (7:27 - 7:31)
never seen that Pokemon like standing up (7:28 - 7:32)
it's always in the air or something like (7:31 - 7:34)
that and so that's kind of cool to see (7:32 - 7:37)
those uh just differences and everything (7:34 - 7:39)
like that so yeah mostly like coming (7:37 - 7:42)
from Legends definitely like just the (7:39 - 7:44)
color and the vibrancy of the of the (7:42 - 7:45)
region (7:44 - 7:47)
yeah it's it's almost like if the game (7:45 - 7:50)
has more Pokemon they can put more (7:47 - 7:53)
Pokemon everywhere uh because Legends (7:50 - 7:55)
the the maybe one of the complaints I (7:53 - 7:57)
would say is that you know it had a very (7:55 - 7:59)
small Pokedex it wasn't particularly (7:57 - 8:02)
large I think it was 230 but when you (7:59 - 8:04)
take in effect uh evolutions and and (8:02 - 8:05)
whatnot (8:04 - 8:08)
um you're kind of limited and I think (8:05 - 8:10)
maybe I'll speak for some people I was (8:08 - 8:13)
pretty much sick of seeing Shanks in (8:10 - 8:15)
Pokemon Legends after uh after a hot (8:13 - 8:20)
minute but man like the uh the tutorial (8:15 - 8:24)
in this game is is pretty long I would (8:20 - 8:27)
say and I try to Jet past that tutorial (8:24 - 8:30)
and I felt like I got punished for it (8:27 - 8:31)
and I don't think that's a bad thing (8:30 - 8:34)
necessarily but like my thought process (8:31 - 8:37)
was if I start catching everything I'm (8:34 - 8:41)
I'm I'm I might over level or uh or I (8:37 - 8:42)
might just never get out of tutorial (8:41 - 8:45)
Ville because like you know they're (8:42 - 8:47)
trying to teach you I get it uh and so I (8:45 - 8:49)
was like you know what I'm not going to (8:47 - 8:50)
catch anything I'm not going to battle (8:49 - 8:52)
any trainers which is a great feature I (8:50 - 8:54)
love the fact that you can just you (8:52 - 8:55)
don't have to worry about you can come (8:54 - 8:56)
back battle the trainers when you want (8:55 - 8:58)
to but then when you try to go into (8:56 - 9:02)
messagosa you get stopped yeah and I got (8:58 - 9:04)
completely destroyed because I was like (9:02 - 9:07)
oh I'll come back to all of this like I (9:04 - 9:08)
I don't need to catch a little chunk (9:07 - 9:09)
right now I'll just come back and I'll (9:08 - 9:11)
catch one uh you know because when I (9:09 - 9:14)
look when I played Legends I I think I (9:11 - 9:17)
spent the first 12 hours in that first (9:14 - 9:19)
area because I was just catching (9:17 - 9:21)
everything yeah and in Legends not only (9:19 - 9:23)
are you just catching one you're (9:21 - 9:25)
catching five b do five Shanks five (9:23 - 9:27)
wormple (9:25 - 9:28)
um all of a sudden there's a mass (9:27 - 9:30)
outbreak you're doing that all of a (9:28 - 9:31)
sudden there's there's something over (9:30 - 9:34)
here you're doing that and I (9:31 - 9:36)
I was like I don't want I I that was a (9:34 - 9:38)
great experience don't get me wrong but (9:36 - 9:40)
I was like I want to like I kind of just (9:38 - 9:42)
wanna you know all the menus to go away (9:40 - 9:44)
I want like I want to be able to ride my (9:42 - 9:47)
my karate on or me ride on I just want (9:44 - 9:50)
to have the World opened up (9:47 - 9:52)
um which is normal in in these kind of (9:50 - 9:54)
games right like even breath of the wild (9:52 - 9:56)
um where you know it's an open world (9:54 - 9:59)
game you still have the tutorial area so (9:56 - 10:00)
and I love breath of the wild played the (9:59 - 10:01)
heck out of breath of the wild my (10:00 - 10:03)
thought process too was I just want to (10:01 - 10:05)
get out of the tutorial area and then I (10:03 - 10:07)
want to figure stuff out but (10:05 - 10:08)
Pokemon kinda (10:07 - 10:12)
punished me for that a bit a little bit (10:08 - 10:15)
yeah (10:12 - 10:15)
um there's some fun things like there's (10:16 - 10:20)
the there's (10:18 - 10:24)
optional battles there's (10:20 - 10:27)
Pokemon that switch in and out on a (10:24 - 10:30)
fairly regular basis like I've gone (10:27 - 10:32)
through it but like I spent probably an (10:30 - 10:34)
hour in the first area walking back and (10:32 - 10:35)
forth because every time I went through (10:34 - 10:37)
I'm like oh this spawned in and I (10:35 - 10:38)
haven't seen it before I'm gonna go look (10:37 - 10:40)
at this (10:38 - 10:42)
um that is really cool because I feel (10:40 - 10:44)
like (10:42 - 10:49)
I it feels it refreshing and somewhat (10:44 - 10:52)
exciting to go into new area to see what (10:49 - 10:54)
has possibly popped in right now (10:52 - 10:57)
I just want to look around and it's fun (10:54 - 10:59)
to look at it's just fun to wander (10:57 - 11:03)
around and look right well and like you (10:59 - 11:05)
know just because it's open world and (11:03 - 11:07)
just you know there's like oh you should (11:05 - 11:09)
go here or whatever but it's like you (11:07 - 11:11)
don't technically have it right and just (11:09 - 11:14)
go to some other way instead and you're (11:11 - 11:15)
all of a sudden you're like oh I haven't (11:14 - 11:17)
seen any of these Pokemon yet like so (11:15 - 11:19)
I'm just gonna run through here and like (11:17 - 11:20)
you said you turn around and it's like (11:19 - 11:21)
oh and then there's something else (11:20 - 11:23)
popping in there and then that kind of (11:21 - 11:25)
leads to another area right and you're (11:23 - 11:27)
all of a sudden you're walking and then (11:25 - 11:28)
before you know it you're like I've (11:27 - 11:30)
completely lost the past where I was (11:28 - 11:32)
actually supposed to go right I'm so (11:30 - 11:35)
lost I have no idea where I am and (11:32 - 11:38)
because the map rotates I have rotated (11:35 - 11:39)
it (11:38 - 11:42)
I've rotated it look this is long before (11:39 - 11:43)
I knew how to interact with these okay (11:42 - 11:46)
okay just uh just for our listeners if (11:43 - 11:49)
you're if if the map rotation is is is (11:46 - 11:51)
weird it is like it's looking very weird (11:49 - 11:54)
you can lock when you're in the map if (11:51 - 11:56)
you hit the R3 which is the right stick (11:54 - 11:59)
it will lock it so North is always north (11:56 - 12:02)
and then that makes that makes (11:59 - 12:04)
understanding that map significantly (12:02 - 12:06)
easier because I went in the map open it (12:04 - 12:08)
up I'm like I'll mark it there and then (12:06 - 12:09)
I left I went back in the map and I'm (12:08 - 12:12)
like my Mark is gone no it's shifted all (12:09 - 12:14)
the way over here how is the map (12:12 - 12:18)
well where am I on this map I have no (12:14 - 12:20)
clue I want to find the person who likes (12:18 - 12:23)
the map that way yeah it's like the (12:20 - 12:25)
worst way to use a map (12:23 - 12:29)
it's like let's move multiple accesses (12:25 - 12:31)
so that you never know exactly where you (12:29 - 12:34)
are always just be locked North is (12:31 - 12:36)
always north it should be like an option (12:34 - 12:40)
to unlock it from its lock state but the (12:36 - 12:41)
mini map (12:40 - 12:42)
is helpful (12:41 - 12:47)
yes very EMF is great except I don't (12:42 - 12:49)
understand maybe I'm just you know not (12:47 - 12:50)
super smart (12:49 - 12:53)
rhetorical uh why does sometimes it show (12:50 - 12:55)
Pokemon and sometimes it doesn't I feel (12:53 - 12:56)
like I noticed that if I go into the map (12:55 - 12:58)
and then leave it all of a sudden the (12:56 - 13:00)
Pokemon are there but if I'm kind of (12:58 - 13:01)
moving between areas it doesn't really (13:00 - 13:05)
populate those on the mini map yeah like (13:01 - 13:07)
similarly something similar came across (13:05 - 13:09)
as there was a specific Pokemon on the (13:07 - 13:12)
map and then I was as far as I could see (13:09 - 13:14)
I was right on top of it like so I (13:12 - 13:16)
figured that area should have had that (13:14 - 13:17)
and it didn't and then I went back and (13:16 - 13:19)
then no Pokemon showed up and I was like (13:17 - 13:22)
wait but it was just there and then it (13:19 - 13:23)
was there again like five minutes later (13:22 - 13:25)
and I was like did I trigger something (13:23 - 13:28)
and I don't I didn't realize it or so (13:25 - 13:30)
there was a game called Pokemon go that (13:28 - 13:33)
had a map feature and they had three (13:30 - 13:35)
little Footprints and it worked so well (13:33 - 13:38)
in that game they just copied and pasted (13:35 - 13:41)
into this one so I I believe the the the (13:38 - 13:44)
mini map shows you potential Pokemon in (13:41 - 13:46)
this is a potential area it also seems (13:44 - 13:48)
to show you ones that have spawned in (13:46 - 13:50)
recently but there's no guarantee T that (13:48 - 13:52)
they will be there (13:50 - 13:54)
should you go looking for them if you're (13:52 - 13:57)
just not right on top of them yeah so I (13:54 - 13:59)
was looking for a water Pokemon and it (13:57 - 14:01)
was like it it set it on the mini map (13:59 - 14:03)
but it wasn't there and then eventually (14:01 - 14:05)
it showed up after I came back and forth (14:03 - 14:07)
so I think it I think the mini-map like (14:05 - 14:09)
I don't know why sometimes it just (14:07 - 14:10)
doesn't show anything but when you go (14:09 - 14:12)
into it it then repopulates I'm not sure (14:10 - 14:17)
if that's a feature or a bug but (14:12 - 14:20)
um it's hard to tell it's real some of (14:17 - 14:21)
those some of the choices in this game (14:20 - 14:23)
are are there's there's so many (14:21 - 14:25)
positives and so many negatives but yeah (14:23 - 14:31)
so I uh I wanted to do an all-water team (14:25 - 14:34)
and I thought to myself you know people (14:31 - 14:37)
say Pokemon games are too easy I wanted (14:34 - 14:40)
a fun way to go through this game (14:37 - 14:40)
um (14:40 - 14:43)
and I I was I already wanted quaxi I (14:40 - 14:44)
already wanted Wiglet there was already (14:43 - 14:46)
another water Pokemon I saw that I (14:44 - 14:48)
wanted that's three I was like well I (14:46 - 14:49)
might as well commit to the whole bit (14:48 - 14:51)
I'll just find another three there's PL (14:49 - 14:52)
there's a lot of new water Pokemon in (14:51 - 14:54)
this game there are uh so there's quite (14:52 - 14:55)
a few (14:54 - 14:57)
um and so my 12 hours was pretty pretty (14:55 - 15:00)
much like well I I guess I'm going to (14:57 - 15:01)
try to figure out how to get into the (15:00 - 15:03)
water and then go up the water and then (15:01 - 15:05)
ignore all these love discs because no (15:03 - 15:07)
one wants to love disc and then of (15:05 - 15:08)
course on the way I'm just getting (15:07 - 15:09)
distracted I'm like at this point I'm (15:08 - 15:10)
catching I'm catching I'm out of (15:09 - 15:12)
pokeballs I gotta go back I feel like (15:10 - 15:14)
I'm too low level now that I've somehow (15:12 - 15:16)
got over here so I'm going to like I (15:14 - 15:19)
guess battle some people and then there (15:16 - 15:22)
it it it is both a blessing and a curse (15:19 - 15:25)
and I I think the biggest compliment I (15:22 - 15:29)
can give this game is that it actually (15:25 - 15:32)
feels like a huge jump (15:29 - 15:36)
in how just Pokemon plays and feels more (15:32 - 15:38)
so than Arceus ever did and I think a (15:36 - 15:40)
lot of people were like oh Arceus (15:38 - 15:42)
finally pushed the the series forward (15:40 - 15:44)
and I think in retrospect yeah like it (15:42 - 15:47)
had like seven battles in it it did for (15:44 - 15:49)
them like every Pokemon game pushes the (15:47 - 15:50)
series forward right right like I don't (15:49 - 15:53)
think anyone's debating that uh but like (15:50 - 15:58)
even with Arceus you you land down you (15:53 - 16:01)
you go through area one you get to the (15:58 - 16:02)
end you beat Cleaver you move to area (16:01 - 16:04)
two you go through area two you beat (16:02 - 16:06)
little again if you move to area three (16:04 - 16:08)
it is very linear in that sense (16:06 - 16:10)
obviously those zones are huge you can (16:08 - 16:15)
explore those zones but by having Titan (16:10 - 16:19)
Battles by having team Star by having uh (16:15 - 16:22)
the gym leader stuff by telling you you (16:19 - 16:24)
can do that in any order and you (16:22 - 16:25)
actually have three characters arguing (16:24 - 16:27)
with you to do that (16:25 - 16:30)
um it really changes the way you play (16:27 - 16:32)
Pokemon in a sense like (16:30 - 16:34)
I think you both can agree that you (16:32 - 16:36)
ended up in a new area and then there's (16:34 - 16:38)
that question of (16:36 - 16:40)
I don't even know if I can battle these (16:38 - 16:41)
people like I don't know what they have (16:40 - 16:44)
I don't know how strong they are (16:41 - 16:49)
um like but I'm here now yeah and I mean (16:44 - 16:51)
you get to the like I got to the first (16:49 - 16:54)
gym and I which which is funny because I (16:51 - 16:57)
I I I cautiously said on my preview (16:54 - 16:59)
after I got back from New York that I (16:57 - 17:01)
didn't think brassius was the first gym (16:59 - 17:03)
because Nintendo didn't tell me that (17:01 - 17:05)
they they never said that this was the (17:03 - 17:07)
first gym which was like my suspicion of (17:05 - 17:08)
like there's probably another gym leader (17:07 - 17:10)
beforehand there is (17:08 - 17:13)
um but yeah like brassius is not the (17:10 - 17:16)
first gym but you could do it first (17:13 - 17:17)
ideally especially if you start with Foy (17:16 - 17:19)
Coco because you know fire is strong (17:17 - 17:21)
against Grass (17:19 - 17:22)
um (17:21 - 17:25)
and (17:22 - 17:25)
the just like okay well if if I know (17:25 - 17:31)
brassius is you know level 22 because of (17:28 - 17:33)
the TR a trailer (17:31 - 17:35)
then I'm assuming the first one's like (17:33 - 17:37)
level 10. (17:35 - 17:39)
but you you don't know that without (17:37 - 17:41)
looking it up and the Pokemon and (17:39 - 17:43)
somebody said well the Pokemon in the (17:41 - 17:44)
area will tell you what the gym leader (17:43 - 17:46)
is everyone is everyone in the area is (17:44 - 17:49)
like seven or nine so I go into that gym (17:46 - 17:51)
thinking oh it's probably like 10 and (17:49 - 17:53)
11. that's what Brock was that's what (17:51 - 17:55)
Sharon was that's what like literally (17:53 - 17:59)
every agent and and uh that gym leader (17:55 - 18:03)
is closer to you know 15 (17:59 - 18:04)
and uh by the way I'm using all water (18:03 - 18:06)
Pokemon so that didn't that wasn't (18:04 - 18:10)
helpful uh but it was it was like okay (18:06 - 18:12)
so I defeated her (18:10 - 18:15)
um and then I can go to brassius and (18:12 - 18:17)
then like I don't what's the next gym (18:15 - 18:19)
like what is their level it's it's weird (18:17 - 18:21)
because the easy thing is like well the (18:19 - 18:23)
next gym is just like this level going (18:21 - 18:27)
forward but old Pokemon games put you in (18:23 - 18:28)
a pretty linear path (18:27 - 18:31)
and you you had a set amount of trainers (18:28 - 18:32)
like let's just bring a brilliant (18:31 - 18:34)
Diamond shining Pearl (18:32 - 18:36)
400 trainers in that game and you can't (18:34 - 18:38)
avoid most of them so you're kind of (18:36 - 18:41)
forced into that (18:38 - 18:43)
um so it's it's it really gives you a (18:41 - 18:45)
different way just to think and feel (18:43 - 18:47)
about Pokemon I don't think that's bad (18:45 - 18:51)
at all but I if but with Legends (18:47 - 18:53)
you don't really have to worry about (18:51 - 18:54)
like a team (18:53 - 18:57)
because you're not really battling yeah (18:54 - 18:59)
ever in that game you're battling the (18:57 - 19:01)
dude with the Togepi the girl with the (18:59 - 19:04)
Eevee and that's like it (19:01 - 19:04)
um I mean this is mini series stuff but (19:04 - 19:09)
I I have some quibbles about the you can (19:07 - 19:11)
go anywhere part of it (19:09 - 19:14)
uh from my experience of trying to go (19:11 - 19:18)
anywhere and taking things out of order (19:14 - 19:20)
um (19:18 - 19:20)
just didn't work out for you or just (19:21 - 19:27)
there there are specific unlocks right (19:24 - 19:30)
like yep uh like you you do need areas (19:27 - 19:32)
where you need to climb and that is you (19:30 - 19:34)
know ride on but not have everything (19:32 - 19:37)
there are also things that are (19:34 - 19:39)
blocked off that you have to complete (19:37 - 19:41)
certain things (19:39 - 19:43)
to get around them (19:41 - 19:46)
uh which I was not expecting (19:43 - 19:50)
uh so yeah it's (19:46 - 19:51)
it is (19:50 - 19:53)
open world (19:51 - 19:56)
and the things are (19:53 - 19:56)
very open and wild but if you explore (19:57 - 20:03)
like I didn't but like I'm gonna go all (20:00 - 20:05)
the way to this place you will run into (20:03 - 20:07)
things where it's like (20:05 - 20:10)
um actually no you're not no you need to (20:07 - 20:13)
go back to do those things because (20:10 - 20:14)
they'll unlock the things that will let (20:13 - 20:17)
you come back here so thanks head back (20:14 - 20:20)
do you think that's just like you made (20:17 - 20:22)
it a lot further than they want you to (20:20 - 20:26)
like like way too far ahead than they (20:22 - 20:29)
wanted you to kind of like with you know (20:26 - 20:30)
I mean open world games do that right (20:29 - 20:32)
there's like a reason that you could go (20:30 - 20:33)
that way but like (20:32 - 20:36)
it's not going to work yeah you know (20:33 - 20:40)
because whatever we hit the (20:36 - 20:40)
um your I'm sorry you're lost uh did you (20:40 - 20:45)
not see the 15 signpoints so we left for (20:44 - 20:47)
you back there I know you ignored them (20:45 - 20:50)
and we said you could you really need to (20:47 - 20:52)
go back there I mean your friends are (20:50 - 20:54)
waiting for you back there your friends (20:52 - 20:56)
aren't here right now go back to your (20:54 - 21:00)
friend's Lost Child I mean there was a (20:56 - 21:01)
point in the game you know in the 12 (21:00 - 21:04)
hours I would say after 12 hours all my (21:01 - 21:07)
Pokemon are around 25. (21:04 - 21:09)
um and I made it to an area with level (21:07 - 21:10)
50 Pokemon (21:09 - 21:12)
and that even even across my mind was (21:10 - 21:14)
like do I brute force and try to catch (21:12 - 21:16)
these Pokemon I probably could right in (21:14 - 21:18)
Legends you could you could catch Alphas (21:16 - 21:20)
that were pretty strong and then I was (21:18 - 21:21)
like does that (21:20 - 21:23)
do I want to do that does that ruin my (21:21 - 21:24)
enjoyment like why am I catching it and (21:23 - 21:26)
then boxing it when I already have like (21:24 - 21:28)
a level 20 version of it like it's it's (21:26 - 21:30)
like this weird thing that you don't (21:28 - 21:32)
really think about in old Pokemon games (21:30 - 21:35)
right yeah but I mean also they brought (21:32 - 21:37)
back the (21:35 - 21:39)
catching difficulty from sword and (21:37 - 21:41)
shield I don't think that's a huge (21:39 - 21:43)
spoiler but (21:41 - 21:45)
it is harder (21:43 - 21:48)
to catch higher level Pokemon (21:45 - 21:51)
if you haven't completed certain tasks (21:48 - 21:54)
and have Pokemon at certain levels (21:51 - 21:56)
was purely level based right like if you (21:54 - 21:58)
were level 13 and it was 14 (21:56 - 22:01)
it was harder to catch yeah it's harder (21:58 - 22:03)
to catch but there were two components (22:01 - 22:05)
Gym badges and (22:03 - 22:07)
uh Pokemon levels that affected (22:05 - 22:09)
difficulty and that has carried over (22:07 - 22:12)
into this game I don't think I've struck (22:09 - 22:13)
to be fair I didn't try to catch those (22:12 - 22:14)
level 50s (22:13 - 22:19)
um I I I have (22:14 - 22:19)
nah those quick balls here's work for (22:23 - 22:28)
you here's here's the thing I have never (22:25 - 22:30)
actually thought I'm really happy that (22:28 - 22:33)
they gave me a code for 100 pokeballs (22:30 - 22:36)
for free before until this game can we (22:33 - 22:38)
talk about that I feel like I'm going (22:36 - 22:40)
through so many pokeballs in this game (22:38 - 22:42)
and it is it is not like Legends like (22:40 - 22:44)
I'm not catching the same Pokemon like I (22:42 - 22:46)
caught like I caught like 15 weasels and (22:44 - 22:47)
I was just like I want to see if one of (22:46 - 22:49)
these have a mark like well I like (22:47 - 22:50)
weasel (22:49 - 22:52)
um but I feel like I am just burning (22:50 - 22:55)
through pokeballs I break your Bronco (22:52 - 22:56)
house and I have no money (22:55 - 22:59)
yeah bro yeah I am broke here's the (22:56 - 23:01)
problem of not having forced trainer (22:59 - 23:05)
battles I am broke I have no cash I (23:01 - 23:07)
cannot update my style (23:05 - 23:10)
at all I look like a basic school (23:07 - 23:13)
student and it is killing my soul (23:10 - 23:15)
yeah yeah that's kind of the weird thing (23:13 - 23:17)
too is again in the linear progression I (23:15 - 23:18)
don't think this is bad for the record I (23:17 - 23:20)
do not think this is bad I think it's (23:18 - 23:21)
just a different way of thinking about a (23:20 - 23:23)
game that you are you have been playing (23:21 - 23:25)
for 25 years (23:23 - 23:28)
um but like you know after I was after I (23:25 - 23:30)
got you know destroyed because I skipped (23:28 - 23:31)
the tutorial I went back and I battled (23:30 - 23:34)
all those trainers and then I bought (23:31 - 23:35)
some clothes and then I was out of money (23:34 - 23:37)
and then I was like well I don't really (23:35 - 23:38)
want to battle anyone I just want to (23:37 - 23:40)
kind of explore and I did that and (23:38 - 23:41)
throughout exploring I was like well I'm (23:40 - 23:44)
still kind of out of money and then I (23:41 - 23:46)
was I was like battling wild Pokemon (23:44 - 23:47)
because I was like well I should get (23:46 - 23:50)
ready for this gym and then I was like (23:47 - 23:51)
well I can battle like the four trainers (23:50 - 23:53)
here and I was like I'm still kinda out (23:51 - 23:58)
of money I am broke but I think I I I (23:53 - 24:00)
think um I think it's just like (23:58 - 24:01)
collecting items right like as soon as I (24:00 - 24:02)
checked my items I was like oh I have (24:01 - 24:04)
two nuggets I have a bunch of pearl (24:02 - 24:05)
strings yeah (24:04 - 24:08)
but I've never had to sell them before I (24:05 - 24:10)
have sat on my treasure Heart Like a (24:08 - 24:12)
terrible dragon type and this is the (24:10 - 24:14)
first where I'm like (24:12 - 24:17)
okay but do I sell these (24:14 - 24:19)
I don't want to it feels wrong to sell (24:17 - 24:22)
my nuggets and how dare you make me do (24:19 - 24:24)
this (24:22 - 24:26)
yeah there's is I mean (24:24 - 24:29)
just to being able to explore and like (24:26 - 24:30)
seeing all the items like there's a (24:29 - 24:32)
there's a lot of (24:30 - 24:34)
items I feel like throughout this game (24:32 - 24:36)
there's a lot of things to pick up and I (24:34 - 24:37)
don't know if you like to pick things up (24:36 - 24:39)
yeah yeah it's like things are more (24:37 - 24:41)
noticeable because of the way they've (24:39 - 24:43)
done it right like (24:41 - 24:45)
um or you also can you know send (24:43 - 24:48)
something out to like look for stuff too (24:45 - 24:51)
so there's that um but it is power on (24:48 - 24:54)
the ground yeah yeah they they really uh (24:51 - 24:56)
they really did the Pokemon thing which (24:54 - 24:58)
is make something really rare in one (24:56 - 25:00)
game make it slightly rare in the next (24:58 - 25:02)
game and then the third game free for (25:00 - 25:05)
all right for all there's nothing but (25:02 - 25:08)
mints everywhere I turn like you want (25:05 - 25:10)
some mint not no not really thanks (25:08 - 25:12)
a couple things before we get to the (25:10 - 25:13)
frame rate issue which I know people are (25:12 - 25:16)
dying to hear about I genuinely think (25:13 - 25:19)
that this game is harder (25:16 - 25:24)
um I I feel like the the NPCs hit harder (25:19 - 25:27)
I feel like their AI is better I have (25:24 - 25:31)
never seen so many pers NPCs use protect (25:27 - 25:35)
and or to to flip that I've never seen (25:31 - 25:38)
NPCs spam the move that is the best move (25:35 - 25:41)
that they can be using yeah and and I (25:38 - 25:43)
say that because that is what we do as (25:41 - 25:46)
players we roll into Blaine's gym he has (25:43 - 25:50)
three fire Pokemon surf surf surf surf (25:46 - 25:51)
there's no reason to hit any other (25:50 - 25:53)
button you just hit the surf button (25:51 - 25:56)
because you win and I have fought NPCs (25:53 - 25:58)
where I'm like man I hope they don't use (25:56 - 25:59)
this move because if they use this move (25:58 - 26:01)
they win and they're like no this is the (25:59 - 26:02)
best move to use I'm just going to (26:01 - 26:05)
continue using it and in past Pokemon (26:02 - 26:08)
games it's it's like the NPC would roll (26:05 - 26:10)
a die like oh they use toxic they rolled (26:08 - 26:12)
the die again oh they they happen to (26:10 - 26:14)
like you a real player wouldn't use (26:12 - 26:16)
toxic twice right no point to we're (26:14 - 26:17)
smarter well maybe if you didn't know (26:16 - 26:20)
what toxic did but like I haven't seen (26:17 - 26:23)
an NPC or even a wild Pokemon make that (26:20 - 26:26)
mistake maybe you know I'll run into it (26:23 - 26:28)
but yeah I I've had a few that I'm like (26:26 - 26:30)
oh you're not good at this but mostly (26:28 - 26:33)
they they do seem to hit harder I seem (26:30 - 26:34)
to hit (26:33 - 26:37)
nothing my punches feel like they're (26:34 - 26:39)
made out of wet paper bags most of the (26:37 - 26:42)
time I'm like I'm I'm dying out here (26:39 - 26:45)
please but I also realize it's because I (26:42 - 26:46)
went to (26:45 - 26:48)
I drove around the area that I was (26:46 - 26:50)
supposed to be in and I'm like yeah come (26:48 - 26:53)
on everybody take oh nope I should not (26:50 - 26:57)
be here I I'm sorry for trespassing I (26:53 - 27:01)
apologize my error but it's also but I (26:57 - 27:04)
also my the issue that I had is I went (27:01 - 27:07)
I for brute forced my way back and when (27:04 - 27:10)
I came back to the earlier (27:07 - 27:13)
things I'm like oh I am (27:10 - 27:16)
blowing through these people (27:13 - 27:17)
I am (27:16 - 27:20)
just mowing them down and (27:17 - 27:23)
that is when I'm like this is how the r (27:20 - 27:26)
part comes in handy because I can just (27:23 - 27:28)
I'm just firing my little guys out like (27:26 - 27:31)
a machine gun go I oh I can't be (27:28 - 27:33)
bothered Papa can't be bothered with (27:31 - 27:35)
these people go with my friends I gotta (27:33 - 27:37)
walk (27:35 - 27:41)
um uh yeah I mean like (27:37 - 27:44)
again I I just want I I go back to you (27:41 - 27:45)
you have to think about this game (27:44 - 27:47)
differently because in a game like bdsp (27:45 - 27:49)
they're gonna kind of feed you those (27:47 - 27:52)
NPCs in order and they're gonna and (27:49 - 27:53)
they're well bdsp is kind of a bad (27:52 - 27:55)
example because I feel like no one gets (27:53 - 27:57)
stronger in that game like you get to (27:55 - 27:58)
the fifth gym and you're still fighting (27:57 - 28:00)
like level 17 people like and you're (27:58 - 28:03)
like why didn't any of the NPCs increase (28:00 - 28:06)
um but in this game they they do you (28:03 - 28:08)
know I I went from I felt like I fought (28:06 - 28:10)
somebody who was level 11 and then I (28:08 - 28:11)
jumped in the water and I swam around a (28:10 - 28:13)
cliff and I got to the beach and all of (28:11 - 28:14)
a sudden they were this person was 26 (28:13 - 28:17)
and I was like I what like how are you (28:14 - 28:19)
so close to this person and your levels (28:17 - 28:22)
are so much different (28:19 - 28:24)
it's a good thing I don't I don't again (28:22 - 28:26)
I don't think it's bad I just you know (28:24 - 28:27)
you're not used to this in a Pokemon (28:26 - 28:29)
game right yeah I mean it's part of what (28:27 - 28:32)
makes this game feel (28:29 - 28:36)
refreshing in a lot of ways like I (28:32 - 28:38)
didn't expect the world to feel this (28:36 - 28:42)
large that the first thing it feels (28:38 - 28:44)
immense (28:42 - 28:46)
I said in my preview too I said this (28:44 - 28:49)
game will make Pokemon Legends seem tiny (28:46 - 28:51)
yeah well it does yeah because I'm like (28:49 - 28:54)
I am lost all the time I've spent hours (28:51 - 28:57)
in one area and still think oh I didn't (28:54 - 29:00)
even see this over here I have no clue (28:57 - 29:02)
where I am because I've spun my map (29:00 - 29:04)
around seven times and I'm completely (29:02 - 29:05)
lost (29:04 - 29:07)
yeah I've fallen into the water and it (29:05 - 29:11)
shot me out somewhere (29:07 - 29:11)
um I feel like with Legends too though (29:11 - 29:17)
like you look at the map overall and (29:13 - 29:18)
it's like oh this looks huge and then (29:17 - 29:20)
with Legends it's like okay but I'm only (29:18 - 29:22)
actually gonna go to these five areas (29:20 - 29:25)
right and then those areas were decent (29:22 - 29:28)
sized but it was just the small it was (29:25 - 29:30)
like areas within that bigger map right (29:28 - 29:32)
and this is like oh it's just everything (29:30 - 29:35)
you know there isn't a like oh you can (29:32 - 29:36)
only go to this this and that it's like (29:35 - 29:39)
it's it's just and like I said I have (29:36 - 29:41)
not nearly as far as you guys are but (29:39 - 29:43)
even in the couple hours I've been (29:41 - 29:44)
playing like (29:43 - 29:47)
I'm just constantly getting lost like I (29:44 - 29:49)
know I can Mark a destination and I know (29:47 - 29:50)
but then all of a sudden I'm like oh (29:49 - 29:52)
what's over here what's up here what's (29:50 - 29:54)
going on there and then I'm like oh I (29:52 - 29:56)
don't even remember what the task was at (29:54 - 29:59)
this point you know so oh yeah I'm like (29:56 - 30:00)
I put a marker on there I have no idea (29:59 - 30:02)
where it is yeah or how to get there (30:00 - 30:05)
whatever one of the the smoothest things (30:02 - 30:07)
they've done whoever was in charge of (30:05 - 30:08)
this needs a raise but when when you get (30:07 - 30:10)
a new message they've done and when they (30:08 - 30:12)
when you get a new Mission it comes up (30:10 - 30:13)
at the top and it has like that slow (30:12 - 30:15)
countdown and you can hit Y to get more (30:13 - 30:18)
info like really intuitive really great (30:15 - 30:21)
um I love seeing like those those things (30:18 - 30:23)
in games because one it you know if (30:21 - 30:24)
you're not really good at video games or (30:23 - 30:26)
you need a pointer all the time boom (30:24 - 30:28)
it's right there uh if you're kind of (30:26 - 30:29)
the the middle person where you're like (30:28 - 30:31)
you kind of want to know but you know (30:29 - 30:32)
sometimes you click it sometimes you (30:31 - 30:34)
it's right there and then if you're a (30:32 - 30:36)
person that's like I don't read anything (30:34 - 30:39)
easy to ignore like it is such a good (30:36 - 30:43)
feature that seems to have no flaws in (30:39 - 30:44)
it popping up there I think it's one of (30:43 - 30:46)
the better things they did one of the (30:44 - 30:49)
bad things I think they did is in 26 (30:46 - 30:51)
years (30:49 - 30:53)
they removed set (30:51 - 30:57)
it's gone I can't yeah I can't like what (30:53 - 30:59)
like I I had totally understood why (30:57 - 31:01)
Legends Arceus does not have it that (30:59 - 31:03)
game has seven gym that the game has (31:01 - 31:05)
seven battles I get it (31:03 - 31:09)
totally I totally understand that just (31:05 - 31:14)
removing it just seems so weird yeah I I (31:09 - 31:17)
I looked and I'm like (31:14 - 31:19)
it can't (31:17 - 31:22)
and here's here's here's here's the (31:19 - 31:24)
series of heartbreaking events that (31:22 - 31:25)
happen (31:24 - 31:27)
I was at the point (31:25 - 31:30)
in the game where I'm like oh I should I (31:27 - 31:31)
probably could start doing battles now I (31:30 - 31:34)
should switch it to (31:31 - 31:37)
set set so that it's there so I went (31:34 - 31:39)
into the options I changed my text speed (31:37 - 31:41)
and I'm like oh (31:39 - 31:44)
I it's not in here (31:41 - 31:46)
it's not oh (31:44 - 31:47)
well it's got to be somewhere else and (31:46 - 31:48)
then I looked and it wasn't so I'm like (31:47 - 31:51)
oh well that's a bad choice I took two (31:48 - 31:53)
steps forward and the mono's like here's (31:51 - 31:58)
a TM by the way they're one use only (31:53 - 32:01)
right I'm not just like (31:58 - 32:07)
how could you do this to me how how (32:01 - 32:07)
the I we we got so many people are like (32:07 - 32:13)
Steve's so hard on the TM machine it's (32:11 - 32:16)
gonna be fine it's it's not fine it's it (32:13 - 32:20)
again the whole point of TMS and all (32:16 - 32:22)
that stuff is to teach your Pokemon new (32:20 - 32:25)
moves I would I would argue I don't have (32:22 - 32:27)
the data but I would argue most people (32:25 - 32:30)
who play through a Pokemon game probably (32:27 - 32:33)
rarely use TMs they probably rarely use (32:30 - 32:35)
held items they have no clue what (32:33 - 32:37)
Natures are which is and they don't they (32:35 - 32:39)
don't even care about abilities and that (32:37 - 32:40)
is a hundred percent fine there's (32:39 - 32:43)
nothing wrong with that but the people (32:40 - 32:47)
who need TMS and who rely on TMS are the (32:43 - 32:50)
competitive people and Pokemon has done (32:47 - 32:53)
such a good job at lowering that barrier (32:50 - 32:55)
to entry to get into competitive with (32:53 - 32:59)
bottle caps with mints with egg moves (32:55 - 33:03)
why have your competitive person find a (32:59 - 33:06)
Pokemon to grind it out to then do a TM (33:03 - 33:10)
like it just like I I get it I get that (33:06 - 33:13)
crafting is the the the current fad I (33:10 - 33:15)
understand there was a point where Call (33:13 - 33:17)
of Duty was like we need levels we need (33:15 - 33:20)
we need our games to be jrpgs we need we (33:17 - 33:22)
need level five until like I get that (33:20 - 33:23)
that was also a fad in a lot of games (33:22 - 33:26)
where now just every game has a leveling (33:23 - 33:27)
system for no reason it's fine I get it (33:26 - 33:29)
but like (33:27 - 33:32)
crafting is here to stay for at least (33:29 - 33:34)
until people get completely sick and (33:32 - 33:35)
bored of it (33:34 - 33:37)
you could have put it almost anywhere (33:35 - 33:40)
else that wasn't creating a brand new (33:37 - 33:43)
barrier of entry for the people who will (33:40 - 33:45)
use it the most and if anyone's (33:43 - 33:47)
commenting like it's not that big of a (33:45 - 33:48)
deal I you probably are not a (33:47 - 33:50)
competitive person that is building (33:48 - 33:53)
multiple teams a week I mean and then (33:50 - 33:54)
these people are the same people that (33:53 - 33:56)
complain that people go to PK hex or (33:54 - 33:58)
they go hack and they're like oh I hate (33:56 - 33:59)
all the competitive people hack it's (33:58 - 34:01)
like yeah because there's so many (33:59 - 34:05)
barriers to make a team quickly that (34:01 - 34:07)
like why why would any competitive (34:05 - 34:09)
person want to spend 30 minutes hunting (34:07 - 34:13)
down uh a fish to get certain scales (34:09 - 34:17)
just to try to see if that move is the (34:13 - 34:20)
right move for their team (34:17 - 34:22)
uh I mean there's a the thing that I (34:20 - 34:24)
like about the team machine is when you (34:22 - 34:26)
find a team in the wild it gets added to (34:24 - 34:27)
the machine (34:26 - 34:31)
what I don't like about the machine is (34:27 - 34:33)
sure got added you're not telling me (34:31 - 34:35)
what the ingredients I need for it and (34:33 - 34:37)
once I make one it's like thanks you're (34:35 - 34:40)
gonna need to do that again (34:37 - 34:40)
I I yeah I don't have anything to add in (34:42 - 34:49)
that situation I mean look the TM (34:47 - 34:51)
machine was exactly what they advertised (34:49 - 34:53)
there was no like maybe post game (34:51 - 34:55)
they're they're just maybe they're (34:53 - 34:58)
handing out the chunk hooves like candy (34:55 - 35:00)
like maybe it doubles the amount of (34:58 - 35:03)
chances I said before like they said (35:00 - 35:05)
that we want to have this let your (35:03 - 35:07)
partners go out in the field for you and (35:05 - 35:08)
then they thought well it's got to come (35:07 - 35:11)
back with something (35:08 - 35:11)
it feels like they they were like where (35:12 - 35:16)
can we put crafting yeah I don't know we (35:14 - 35:19)
had when they turned TMS unlimited that (35:16 - 35:21)
was the correct Choice Yep this seems (35:19 - 35:24)
like a step backwards this it felt (35:21 - 35:25)
it (35:24 - 35:28)
to have that and then find out that set (35:25 - 35:30)
has gone up like (35:28 - 35:32)
the same like two minutes the set thing (35:30 - 35:36)
I rolled my eyes and I was like like (35:32 - 35:37)
for those that don't know set and shift (35:36 - 35:39)
they've been in the game since red and (35:37 - 35:40)
blue (35:39 - 35:42)
um shift is the default what happens is (35:40 - 35:43)
when when you're battling I don't know (35:42 - 35:44)
why I always use playing when you're (35:43 - 35:46)
battling Blaine and he sends out a (35:44 - 35:48)
Rapidash it'll say like Blaine is (35:46 - 35:50)
sending out Rapidash would you like to (35:48 - 35:52)
switch yes or no (35:50 - 35:55)
set is Blaine just sends it out you have (35:52 - 35:59)
no option this is very popular in you (35:55 - 36:00)
know people who knows like this is (35:59 - 36:01)
popular for people who just want it to (36:00 - 36:02)
be a little bit harder this is just (36:01 - 36:04)
popular for people who are familiar with (36:02 - 36:05)
Pokemon and don't want to answer that (36:04 - 36:08)
question every single time because it's (36:05 - 36:10)
like you know my Pokemon should be able (36:08 - 36:11)
to handle it if it can't I'll switch on (36:10 - 36:12)
my own (36:11 - 36:15)
um and to be fair you can still do all (36:12 - 36:17)
of that you know if it says Blaine is (36:15 - 36:19)
sending out a Rapidash you can say no (36:17 - 36:21)
and that's the same asset you just have (36:19 - 36:24)
to answer that question every time (36:21 - 36:26)
um (36:24 - 36:29)
knowing this company of you know turning (36:26 - 36:31)
removing the you know experience share (36:29 - 36:35)
doing all these other things uh I I (36:31 - 36:37)
doubt this is you know they'll add it (36:35 - 36:38)
back in an update I'm not going to hold (36:37 - 36:40)
my breath for that it seems they made (36:38 - 36:42)
that choice and the game freak likes to (36:40 - 36:44)
stick with the choices they make yep AKA (36:42 - 36:46)
cutting the national decks they're (36:44 - 36:49)
sticking with that look I can't I can't (36:46 - 36:53)
National my heart my heart is broken you (36:49 - 36:56)
can you can see go to my Twitter while (36:53 - 36:57)
it's still up for the next I don't know (36:56 - 37:00)
when we do the new series drag you can (36:57 - 37:02)
tell me all the new Pokemon you love (37:00 - 37:04)
Oh short list okay we got we got the (37:02 - 37:06)
frame rate issue there was a bunch of (37:04 - 37:08)
reviews before we get to the frame rate (37:06 - 37:11)
issue I want to talk about the other (37:08 - 37:15)
choice that they made that makes (37:11 - 37:15)
me feel bad and that is they took away (37:15 - 37:22)
shops and just made the menus I brought (37:20 - 37:26)
that up in my preview because (37:22 - 37:26)
it makes the cities feel like set pieces (37:27 - 37:34)
I think what's worse is not only did (37:32 - 37:36)
they do that but they separated out each (37:34 - 37:39)
shop to add more shops they did so I (37:36 - 37:42)
walk into a wall with a menu and (37:39 - 37:44)
sometimes the menu has pictures (37:42 - 37:48)
sometimes it doesn't why don't know we (37:44 - 37:50)
didn't pay for picture budget for this (37:48 - 37:51)
shop (37:50 - 37:54)
and also (37:51 - 37:54)
there's a thing about World building (37:54 - 37:58)
like I get that walking into the (37:56 - 38:00)
clothing store you didn't interact with (37:58 - 38:02)
anybody in there but it made the city (38:00 - 38:05)
feel like a city there were people in (38:02 - 38:08)
there when I'm walking into a wall (38:05 - 38:10)
and then I get kicked out of the wall (38:08 - 38:11)
because I didn't want anything that was (38:10 - 38:13)
posted on your bulletin board I just (38:11 - 38:17)
feel like I'm on a fake set every time (38:13 - 38:20)
most of the doors are closed and the few (38:17 - 38:22)
doors that are open most of them don't (38:20 - 38:24)
go anywhere but to a menu and there's (38:22 - 38:27)
not even a person talking to me it is (38:24 - 38:29)
not just a venue (38:27 - 38:31)
is I feel like (38:29 - 38:35)
walking into a door to get a menu felt (38:31 - 38:36)
bad when I first did it when I played in (38:35 - 38:39)
New York but when you talk to the person (38:36 - 38:41)
in the gas station they just present you (38:39 - 38:42)
a menu (38:41 - 38:45)
which is ultimately the same thing but (38:42 - 38:46)
because that person is there and (38:45 - 38:49)
interacting with it it feels it feels (38:46 - 38:51)
better yeah right well it feels like (38:49 - 38:55)
you're written a world yeah like walking (38:51 - 38:57)
into a door you have no clue who you're (38:55 - 38:58)
talking to you don't know what the (38:57 - 38:59)
inside of the building looks like it's (38:58 - 39:01)
almost like almost every single shop (38:59 - 39:03)
should have been like a little like uh (39:01 - 39:05)
food truck or something yeah at least (39:03 - 39:07)
you're like saying I do a machine just (39:05 - 39:10)
say like pit E4 for a new pair of shoes (39:07 - 39:12)
just it (39:10 - 39:14)
if it (39:12 - 39:19)
for a world that feels so alive outside (39:14 - 39:21)
to go into a City full of robots because (39:19 - 39:25)
we'll talk about that in a second (39:21 - 39:25)
to walk into fake buildings it's just (39:25 - 39:28)
like (39:28 - 39:32)
come on yeah I'm actually surprised that (39:28 - 39:33)
I don't think I read a single review (39:32 - 39:35)
that brought that up and I was like oh (39:33 - 39:36)
that was like when I was playing the (39:35 - 39:39)
thing in New York I was like I was like (39:36 - 39:40)
thinking of what reviewers would (39:39 - 39:42)
complain about I was like oh probably (39:40 - 39:43)
like the building the building thing (39:42 - 39:45)
like right away I was like oh this is (39:43 - 39:46)
jarring (39:45 - 39:49)
um and then uh the catching Arceus stuff (39:46 - 39:51)
which (39:49 - 39:53)
I really don't think is that bad after (39:51 - 39:54)
playing 12 hours like I don't think it's (39:53 - 39:55)
bad at all I should say I don't think I (39:54 - 39:57)
I like I like the catching in Arceus I (39:55 - 39:59)
also like the catching and let's go I (39:57 - 40:01)
like catching Pokemon I really think (39:59 - 40:02)
they they kind of came up with like a (40:01 - 40:05)
happy medium in this game uh where you (40:02 - 40:07)
know you're not you're not catching (40:05 - 40:09)
five be doof to complete a pokedex (40:07 - 40:11)
you're com catching one B doof and if (40:09 - 40:13)
you want to you know catch more be doof (40:11 - 40:15)
it's it's like past Pokemon games (40:13 - 40:17)
um we got to talk about the frame rate (40:15 - 40:18)
stuff I don't want this show to be too (40:17 - 40:23)
long so uh all of the reviews were (40:18 - 40:24)
pretty positive on the game and I I (40:23 - 40:26)
think we've we've been pretty positive (40:24 - 40:28)
here um but I think we we all came into (40:26 - 40:30)
this this recording with with that same (40:28 - 40:33)
complaint that the the the game it (40:30 - 40:37)
chugs and and the frame rate is terrible (40:33 - 40:39)
like a slog (40:37 - 40:43)
sometimes to work and (40:39 - 40:46)
because of the frame rate every time I (40:43 - 40:48)
approach a new town I feel like oh I'm (40:46 - 40:50)
walking into robot field because (40:48 - 40:52)
they're all (40:50 - 40:54)
and then the minute you're close it's (40:52 - 40:57)
like oh a human's nearby act human stop (40:54 - 41:00)
acting like a robot please and it's so (40:57 - 41:02)
jarring (41:00 - 41:06)
to be like why is everybody walking so (41:02 - 41:08)
weird except when I finally get close (41:06 - 41:13)
enough you all smooth out it's bad (41:08 - 41:15)
also (41:13 - 41:17)
don't throw a Pokeball in the water (41:15 - 41:20)
because it will it will it will mess (41:17 - 41:21)
with your mind and you will never look (41:20 - 41:23)
at the world the same way absolutely (41:21 - 41:25)
that was probably that was the most (41:23 - 41:27)
jarring thing for me again earlier in (41:25 - 41:29)
the game and I will say I didn't (41:27 - 41:30)
actually this is one of the first (41:29 - 41:33)
Pokemon games where I went in with as (41:30 - 41:35)
little knowledge as possible so like I (41:33 - 41:37)
you know listen to the podcast when you (41:35 - 41:39)
were leading up to it and I listened to (41:37 - 41:42)
the stuff after New York but I didn't I (41:39 - 41:44)
didn't actually read any reviews I (41:42 - 41:46)
didn't so going into it I actually (41:44 - 41:50)
didn't know about the frame rate issue I (41:46 - 41:51)
didn't either I heard anything about it (41:50 - 41:53)
and I was staying away from a lot of (41:51 - 41:54)
stuff just because I was like you know (41:53 - 41:56)
what I'm gonna go into this with nothing (41:54 - 41:58)
and I just you know just play it like (41:56 - 42:01)
this and immediately I was like (41:58 - 42:04)
oh I'm guessing this was like the most (42:01 - 42:06)
hit-on thing in a review it was like you (42:04 - 42:08)
know a minute or two into the game (42:06 - 42:10)
you're like (42:08 - 42:14)
what happened here like so so here's the (42:10 - 42:17)
thing right uh you know prior prior to (42:14 - 42:19)
the reviews coming out and me streaming (42:17 - 42:20)
sword and shield because you know I'm (42:19 - 42:22)
waiting for the game to come out people (42:20 - 42:23)
are like hey Steve what do you feel (42:22 - 42:25)
about all the review stuff and you know (42:23 - 42:27)
the frame rate thing that everyone keeps (42:25 - 42:29)
talking about and I was like I played (42:27 - 42:31)
the game I played it you know over a (42:29 - 42:32)
month ago I played it in New York (42:31 - 42:34)
Nintendo invited me out I you know we (42:32 - 42:37)
did our coverage on it uh on YouTube and (42:34 - 42:40)
and the podcast and stuff I was like the (42:37 - 42:42)
game ran great for me beautiful no (42:40 - 42:44)
issues I I argue I said it would rain (42:42 - 42:46)
better than Legends Arceus I I sincerely (42:44 - 42:49)
think it did thought it did so when all (42:46 - 42:50)
these people were coming to my twitch (42:49 - 42:53)
stream or or on Twitter I saw this or in (42:50 - 42:55)
the slack or in the Discord of like what (42:53 - 42:56)
do you think about the frame rate stuff (42:55 - 42:57)
people are talking about I'm just like (42:56 - 43:00)
ah people over exaggerating right you (42:57 - 43:01)
know Pokemon if there's anyone who hates (43:00 - 43:04)
Pokemon games the most it's Pokemon fans (43:01 - 43:06)
right just you know this is the tree (43:04 - 43:09)
thing again in sword and shield like I'm (43:06 - 43:10)
sure the trees look bad that doesn't (43:09 - 43:12)
affect it I'm sure like okay maybe when (43:10 - 43:13)
you get into the city it's a little (43:12 - 43:15)
choppy you know sword and shield had (43:13 - 43:16)
this too right you know you saw Wiggles (43:15 - 43:19)
flying not that big of a deal and I (43:16 - 43:22)
started playing it and I was like this (43:19 - 43:24)
this is not what I played in New York (43:22 - 43:28)
like like I cannot (43:24 - 43:31)
I I don't know how to put words (43:28 - 43:33)
I don't know how to say how I played a (43:31 - 43:35)
totally different game in New York it (43:33 - 43:39)
ran so smooth there was none of this the (43:35 - 43:42)
only issue I saw was when I was making a (43:39 - 43:44)
sandwich a little piece of lettuce did (43:42 - 43:45)
this like little jittery thing and then (43:44 - 43:47)
like floated down through the table and (43:45 - 43:48)
I was like Ah that's funny huh (43:47 - 43:50)
unfinished game no big deal like it was (43:48 - 43:52)
funny (43:50 - 43:53)
um (43:52 - 43:58)
this game is like doesn't even it's so (43:53 - 44:02)
choppy and so like everything feels like (43:58 - 44:04)
a robot like what Greg said but again I (44:02 - 44:07)
fought Titans I explored all the same (44:04 - 44:11)
area I did Mela I did the gym I I flew I (44:07 - 44:15)
swam I caught things it ran so smooth (44:11 - 44:17)
for me in New York and they were like (44:15 - 44:19)
the the you know they were like hey when (44:17 - 44:21)
you go to messagosa don't go in any (44:19 - 44:22)
buildings my thought process was well (44:21 - 44:24)
maybe well you can't go into any (44:22 - 44:26)
building so maybe that was actually the (44:24 - 44:27)
joke but I was like oh you know maybe (44:26 - 44:28)
they're still tightening things up in (44:27 - 44:30)
Massachusetts you know two months ago (44:28 - 44:32)
um they were like hey when when when you (44:30 - 44:35)
defeat a cloth in the Titan battle don't (44:32 - 44:37)
chase him make sense now every like the (44:35 - 44:40)
10 battles have two battles each (44:37 - 44:40)
um (44:40 - 44:44)
it was just a different and I and (44:40 - 44:46)
they has to be fixed right like oh (44:44 - 44:50)
there's no way they can continue I mean (44:46 - 44:53)
this without being fixed and I I want to (44:50 - 44:55)
say I have faith that they will fix it (44:53 - 44:56)
because again I want to stress that I (44:55 - 44:58)
played a different game I actually (44:56 - 45:00)
talked to other people that are at that (44:58 - 45:02)
preview event and they all said the same (45:00 - 45:05)
thing I was like am I crazy did I (45:02 - 45:07)
did you guys think that that game ran (45:05 - 45:08)
really smooth in New York and they were (45:07 - 45:11)
like yes a hundred percent this game is (45:08 - 45:13)
running terrible compared to what we (45:11 - 45:17)
played two months ago I mean it was (45:13 - 45:19)
shocking when I got it and I'm like what (45:17 - 45:20)
is and I thought (45:19 - 45:22)
well because I got it early I thought (45:20 - 45:26)
whoa I must not have the different patch (45:22 - 45:27)
downloaded yeah like there's something (45:26 - 45:29)
else coming and so I still played it I'm (45:27 - 45:31)
like I'll accept it and then midnight (45:29 - 45:34)
rolled around nothing updated of it oh (45:31 - 45:38)
no no no no no no no no and (45:34 - 45:41)
it's not just the frame rate there are a (45:38 - 45:44)
number of Super wonky things that can (45:41 - 45:46)
happen in that game I have been in the (45:44 - 45:48)
middle of battle where my camera has (45:46 - 45:50)
shot me into the ground where I'm seeing (45:48 - 45:53)
half the screen up ground and then the (45:50 - 45:56)
yawning void of no code below it and I'm (45:53 - 45:58)
like how did I get here (45:56 - 46:02)
how am I here well and not to like just (45:58 - 46:04)
go off into how many different you know (46:02 - 46:06)
types of issues like that there are but (46:04 - 46:08)
right when you're in your room like the (46:06 - 46:09)
beginning of the game (46:08 - 46:12)
I stepped out of there or you know (46:09 - 46:14)
whatever down the stairs and immediately (46:12 - 46:15)
noticed things where I was like wait (46:14 - 46:17)
hold on like let me go back up the (46:15 - 46:19)
stairs and do that again because there's (46:17 - 46:20)
no way that it's like (46:19 - 46:22)
it was just that noticeable that (46:20 - 46:25)
immediate it was and it was like this is (46:22 - 46:28)
this does not feel like a 2022 Pokemon (46:25 - 46:32)
game like it's very heartbreaking in the (46:28 - 46:35)
fact that it all of all of the worst (46:32 - 46:37)
critics (46:35 - 46:41)
are Justified with this one because it (46:37 - 46:44)
is it is (46:41 - 46:48)
it is almost experience ruining at times (46:44 - 46:51)
like it I would agree Fame is so (46:48 - 46:55)
beautiful but when I see seven people (46:51 - 47:00)
jittering across the ground and I'm like (46:55 - 47:03)
why what is that just don't render them (47:00 - 47:06)
in right well okay like think about and (47:03 - 47:09)
like obviously sword and shield zashian (47:06 - 47:11)
or zonizenta turning around right like (47:09 - 47:15)
and how much that takes you out of the (47:11 - 47:17)
moment right and it's like that same (47:15 - 47:18)
thing right you're discovering a new (47:17 - 47:20)
region a new area you're like wow this (47:18 - 47:24)
is amazing this is great this is uh oh (47:20 - 47:27)
yeah like I've lost the like this moment (47:24 - 47:29)
of whatever I was just discovering you (47:27 - 47:31)
know and that's unfortunate the game is (47:29 - 47:36)
so beautiful and it's so huge and (47:31 - 47:39)
I was so and I still am I'm still (47:36 - 47:41)
excited to play I'm still excited to (47:39 - 47:45)
explore but it's got such a heavy lid on (47:41 - 47:48)
it because I never know (47:45 - 47:50)
when it's going to feel like it's (47:48 - 47:52)
unplayable all of a sudden or when I'm (47:50 - 47:54)
just gonna suddenly stop (47:52 - 47:59)
for no reason while the game catches up (47:54 - 48:00)
I mean there's been a number of times (47:59 - 48:02)
where I've gone and walked forward and (48:00 - 48:05)
I'm like oh we have to wait (48:02 - 48:05)
and now I can continue (48:06 - 48:11)
yeah I will I will say there was one (48:08 - 48:13)
Pokemon who I'm not gonna get into (48:11 - 48:15)
details they did turn around and when (48:13 - 48:17)
they turned around it was like that was (48:15 - 48:18)
at least a smooth animation that like (48:17 - 48:20)
that was an improvement from the last (48:18 - 48:22)
time we saw Pokemon turn around and it (48:20 - 48:25)
was awful but other than that I was like (48:22 - 48:28)
uh yeah I mean we there are a lot of (48:25 - 48:31)
great things uh they're they're a ton (48:28 - 48:34)
of Pokemon walking around you know new (48:31 - 48:35)
moves I already saw (48:34 - 48:37)
um (48:35 - 48:39)
we can save a lot of the stuff for the (48:37 - 48:42)
mini series quick thing the textures on (48:39 - 48:44)
the Pokemon like in battles their skin (48:42 - 48:46)
and their fur (48:44 - 48:48)
blew me away yep anytime they're up (48:46 - 48:50)
close like any time it cuts in it's like (48:48 - 48:53)
up close all of a sudden to a Pokemon I (48:50 - 48:55)
was like well this is this is beautiful (48:53 - 48:58)
like the way that they show it but then (48:55 - 49:01)
pan out and you're like what doesn't I (48:58 - 49:04)
mean you know yeah I I don't I 100 agree (49:01 - 49:06)
with Greg of the game is beautiful I I (49:04 - 49:07)
still think let's go Pikachu let's go (49:06 - 49:09)
Eevee is probably the most gorgeous (49:07 - 49:11)
Pokemon game they've put out (49:09 - 49:14)
um I just because I just think the style (49:11 - 49:17)
they decided to go with let's go Pikachu (49:14 - 49:20)
let's go Eevee fits Pokemon so well (49:17 - 49:23)
um I get the realistic you know kind of (49:20 - 49:24)
look they're going for (49:23 - 49:26)
um but it does to me still come across (49:24 - 49:28)
muddy at times (49:26 - 49:30)
um in some instances and I at this point (49:28 - 49:32)
I don't know if that's because of frame (49:30 - 49:35)
rate or yeah I mean (49:32 - 49:37)
the thing that the thing I like about (49:35 - 49:40)
this art style is this feels more (49:37 - 49:42)
grounded in reality where let's go (49:40 - 49:45)
Pikachu left let's go Evie felt like a (49:42 - 49:46)
cartoon I think that's a preference and (49:45 - 49:49)
I think I and it is a preference (49:46 - 49:52)
I don't prefer the cartoon because I (49:49 - 49:54)
played World of Warcraft for so long and (49:52 - 49:56)
that makes sense I am done with that I (49:54 - 49:58)
am done I am done with that oh well (49:56 - 50:00)
let's let's be clear here let's go Pichu (49:58 - 50:01)
let's go Evie looks better than World of (50:00 - 50:04)
Warcraft (50:01 - 50:04)
okay a couple things I did some testing (50:06 - 50:11)
on my own maybe somebody else did I (50:09 - 50:12)
don't know I haven't really looked at (50:11 - 50:13)
the internet I've been streaming for 12 (50:12 - 50:14)
hours (50:13 - 50:17)
if you are playing in a handheld mode (50:14 - 50:19)
apparently the game runs better I (50:17 - 50:21)
believe that is because handheld mode is (50:19 - 50:24)
is locked at 720p you actually even if (50:21 - 50:26)
you're on an OLED (50:24 - 50:28)
um switch you don't get 1080p on that (50:26 - 50:30)
you get 720. it's a smaller screen it (50:28 - 50:33)
still looks good at 720. what you can do (50:30 - 50:34)
is if you go into your settings on your (50:33 - 50:37)
switch and scroll down to TV your (50:34 - 50:39)
default is set to automatic you can (50:37 - 50:42)
change that to 1080 or 720 or 480. (50:39 - 50:45)
change it to 720 unless you have like a (50:42 - 50:48)
4K OLED TV you're playing on you're not (50:45 - 50:49)
going to notice a difference and I've (50:48 - 50:52)
tried I played six hours on automatic I (50:49 - 50:55)
then played two hours on 720. I played (50:52 - 50:57)
two hours on 1080 and then I went back (50:55 - 51:01)
to 720 720 runs incredibly smooth it's (50:57 - 51:05)
not perfect and it's it's actually uh (51:01 - 51:06)
almost (51:05 - 51:11)
uh unbelievable that we're playing a a (51:06 - 51:13)
2022 Pokemon game and I have to tell you (51:11 - 51:15)
to go into settings to drop it down to (51:13 - 51:18)
720 so it runs okay there are some weird (51:15 - 51:20)
Boomer people out there that don't (51:18 - 51:22)
believe in auto save you are absolutely (51:20 - 51:24)
out of your mind if you are turning off (51:22 - 51:27)
auto save in this game I have I have (51:24 - 51:29)
seen so many people come in being like I (51:27 - 51:30)
lost two hours of progress My Game just (51:29 - 51:32)
crashed I didn't I didn't think I didn't (51:30 - 51:35)
forget to save like no you like there (51:32 - 51:38)
are so many there are so few instances (51:35 - 51:41)
where you need auto save off if you're (51:38 - 51:45)
gonna like soft reset for uh nature on a (51:41 - 51:48)
starter or soft reset for I don't know a (51:45 - 51:50)
certain Legend I I don't I don't know if (51:48 - 51:52)
if you can't even do that right you (51:50 - 51:54)
would turn autosave off to do that but (51:52 - 51:56)
you do not need to turn autosave off (51:54 - 51:58)
from moving from point A to point B and (51:56 - 52:00)
just level grinding and filling your (51:58 - 52:03)
Pokedex keep it on maybe if this game (52:00 - 52:06)
gets an update hopefully it will (52:03 - 52:08)
um you can feel comfortable but I do not (52:06 - 52:11)
recommend having auto save off I also (52:08 - 52:12)
want to say that (52:11 - 52:15)
this is not the first time that a (52:12 - 52:16)
Pokemon game has come out kind of broken (52:15 - 52:19)
uh I've I've said multiple times on this (52:16 - 52:21)
podcast I don't think game freak is the (52:19 - 52:23)
best developer out there I do not think (52:21 - 52:24)
that (52:23 - 52:26)
uh they hit out of the park with (52:24 - 52:28)
development there are some good (52:26 - 52:31)
developers out there uh game wise I (52:28 - 52:34)
think game freaks average I I think they (52:31 - 52:36)
they they obviously understand their (52:34 - 52:37)
custom code (52:36 - 52:40)
um so probably getting outside help is (52:37 - 52:43)
pretty hard that's just a guess but I (52:40 - 52:45)
don't think I've ever been blown away by (52:43 - 52:49)
like game freaks coding abilities (52:45 - 52:50)
um now in X and Y there was a game (52:49 - 52:52)
breaking bug where if you saved in lumio (52:50 - 52:54)
City uh your game just wouldn't boot up (52:52 - 52:57)
yep and that existed for about two weeks (52:54 - 52:59)
that is a game breaking bug at least in (52:57 - 53:02)
this case not game breaking but also me (52:59 - 53:03)
telling you to pump your game down to (53:02 - 53:07)
720 ain't great either uh X and Y had a (53:03 - 53:10)
couple issues most of those fixed pretty (53:07 - 53:11)
quickly sword and shield I actually (53:10 - 53:13)
don't think had any game breaking or (53:11 - 53:14)
anything issue I can't remember anything (53:13 - 53:17)
sword and shield I know it had updates (53:14 - 53:19)
um that that happened I know people were (53:17 - 53:20)
like fix the shinies they never did (53:19 - 53:22)
because it wasn't technically broken (53:20 - 53:24)
um and I just want to remind everyone (53:22 - 53:25)
that this this wonderful game that (53:24 - 53:28)
people remember uh Diamond and Pearl (53:25 - 53:31)
came out for the DS uh 15 years ago and (53:28 - 53:34)
that game ran like absolute garbage uh (53:31 - 53:36)
you would you would use brick break on a (53:34 - 53:37)
Chansey and in that time of break (53:36 - 53:40)
breaking the Chansey you could you could (53:37 - 53:42)
make a one hour collect call to (53:40 - 53:44)
Australia and that chancey's health bar (53:42 - 53:46)
would still be going down because of how (53:44 - 53:49)
slow and sluggish Diamond and Pearl ran (53:46 - 53:52)
like there was I love Platinum I think (53:49 - 53:55)
Platinum is a fantastic version of that (53:52 - 53:58)
game there's zero reason in the entire (53:55 - 54:01)
world to ever play Diamond and Pearl (53:58 - 54:04)
because 900 plus issues were fixed from (54:01 - 54:06)
Diamond and Pearl to platinum and it is (54:04 - 54:08)
a significantly better game (54:06 - 54:10)
um (54:08 - 54:10)
I don't know why this game runs so (54:11 - 54:17)
poorly when two months ago I played a (54:14 - 54:19)
different game I played a totally (54:17 - 54:21)
different game I also watched I watched (54:19 - 54:24)
a review from Game Spot and what was (54:21 - 54:27)
shocking is I agreed with I think if if (54:24 - 54:28)
you have time to watch a 10 minute (54:27 - 54:29)
review I think that's probably the (54:28 - 54:31)
review to watch if you're on the fence I (54:29 - 54:33)
think the review was spot on I agreed (54:31 - 54:34)
with every single thing they said and I (54:33 - 54:36)
was like okay last two minutes of the (54:34 - 54:37)
review they're going to talk about the (54:36 - 54:40)
frame rate and they go uh frame rate was (54:37 - 54:42)
awesome everything was perfect and (54:40 - 54:45)
everyone was like what like it must have (54:42 - 54:47)
been that patch because that patch came (54:45 - 54:49)
out within the last like five or six (54:47 - 54:51)
days and obviously if you're a reviewer (54:49 - 54:52)
you would have got the game two weeks (54:51 - 54:54)
ago so they probably played through it (54:52 - 54:56)
wrote the review up the last couple days (54:54 - 54:57)
and published it because they didn't (54:56 - 54:59)
have any (54:57 - 55:00)
they didn't say anything bad about the (54:59 - 55:02)
frame rate and every other Reviewer is (55:00 - 55:03)
so it's like (55:02 - 55:05)
did you not get the patch was it the (55:03 - 55:08)
patch that like blew in the frame rate (55:05 - 55:11)
it's so weird maybe that's weird I (55:08 - 55:12)
didn't again I didn't read the reviews (55:11 - 55:14)
but that's really weird that they didn't (55:12 - 55:17)
but like every other reviewer seemed to (55:14 - 55:19)
notice that though so you know people (55:17 - 55:21)
procrastinate you say the review to last (55:19 - 55:23)
minute (55:21 - 55:23)
like I said you know I talked to other (55:26 - 55:29)
people at the preview event I know that (55:27 - 55:31)
person who did The Game Swap review was (55:29 - 55:34)
also the preview event not mine (55:31 - 55:36)
uh there was no frame rate issues then (55:34 - 55:38)
there's frame rate issues now (55:36 - 55:43)
um due to the 720p thing I I suggested (55:38 - 55:45)
um or playing handheld mode I guess do (55:43 - 55:47)
not yeah would not advise to have auto (55:45 - 55:50)
save off also real quick uh you can't (55:47 - 55:52)
toggle battle animations that's weird (55:50 - 55:54)
that was in Legends I know that for sure (55:52 - 55:56)
again not a lot of battles and legends (55:54 - 55:57)
we've already talked about that but they (55:56 - 56:00)
remove set and shift They removed battle (55:57 - 56:03)
animations but you know they did put the (56:00 - 56:05)
sound settings in the in the settings (56:03 - 56:07)
instead of just finding a random NPC in (56:05 - 56:08)
sword and shield to give you headphones (56:07 - 56:10)
I don't know whose decision that was in (56:08 - 56:11)
sword and shield but they had to (56:10 - 56:13)
sacrifice set so that they could give (56:11 - 56:16)
you music sound settings immediately so (56:13 - 56:18)
much room in the setting panel what are (56:16 - 56:20)
we cutting what are we getting rid of (56:18 - 56:22)
we don't want our users to scroll down (56:20 - 56:24)
to see more settings (56:22 - 56:25)
um (56:24 - 56:27)
12 hours (56:25 - 56:31)
besides the frame rate issue stuff (56:27 - 56:33)
besides a couple of the bugs that you (56:31 - 56:35)
guys have talked about (56:33 - 56:37)
I can't put this game down (56:35 - 56:40)
I I there's something about the world (56:37 - 56:44)
that is so infectious and I I have I'm (56:40 - 56:47)
not even close to exploring all of it (56:44 - 56:49)
and I and I like I walk to two new (56:47 - 56:52)
cities and I I I I haven't seen (56:49 - 56:54)
everything in the city like it like (56:52 - 56:55)
there's something about this game that (56:54 - 56:58)
is almost (56:55 - 57:03)
good like it's good minus the issues we (56:58 - 57:04)
said but I feel like this could have (57:03 - 57:06)
been (57:04 - 57:08)
easily I could see all the reviews being (57:06 - 57:10)
like this is the best Pokemon game ever (57:08 - 57:12)
but everything we just talked about I (57:10 - 57:15)
think puts it pretty low honestly (57:12 - 57:17)
like I think the frame rate thing is a (57:15 - 57:18)
big deal (57:17 - 57:22)
well the thing that's I get good there (57:18 - 57:25)
maybe uh is that it hopefully can be (57:22 - 57:29)
fixed right like so you know if that is (57:25 - 57:30)
true and I mean I feel the same way (57:29 - 57:33)
again only two hours in but uh I mean I (57:30 - 57:35)
want to play more right like as soon as (57:33 - 57:37)
we're done here I'm just gonna be (57:35 - 57:39)
hopping back on the switch to play (57:37 - 57:43)
um but if that is you know the thing and (57:39 - 57:45)
I'm thinking it too it's like a frame (57:43 - 57:48)
rate thing is the only thing and not the (57:45 - 57:50)
only thing but one of the very few (57:48 - 57:51)
things where I'm like ah but the rest of (57:50 - 57:55)
this game is great then hopefully they (57:51 - 57:58)
can they'll possibly patch something and (57:55 - 58:00)
and fix that or at least improve it to (57:58 - 58:02)
some extent but I mean they approved (58:00 - 58:05)
things post (58:02 - 58:07)
Sergeant Shield launch I I have hope (58:05 - 58:09)
that they will (58:07 - 58:14)
push a patch out and fix this it's just (58:09 - 58:17)
it is such a shame like (58:14 - 58:19)
such a (58:17 - 58:22)
like what could have like it could have (58:19 - 58:25)
been like the crowning achievement right (58:22 - 58:28)
like this could have been the hit the (58:25 - 58:29)
ground running they knocked it out of (58:28 - 58:32)
the park and (58:29 - 58:34)
didn't (58:32 - 58:36)
you know they walked to First at this (58:34 - 58:37)
one (58:36 - 58:41)
yeah it's uh (58:37 - 58:43)
it's like you can you can I know that (58:41 - 58:46)
the default is like ah the the most (58:43 - 58:48)
richest Media company in in the world (58:46 - 58:52)
yeah I mean like you know I say this all (58:48 - 58:53)
the time sixty percent of the revenues (58:52 - 58:55)
from plushes it's not like every time a (58:53 - 58:56)
Pikachu plush is sold they give game (58:55 - 58:58)
freak a dollar to like make their game (58:56 - 59:01)
better that's not how it works I I mean (58:58 - 59:05)
I just feel like something went in (59:01 - 59:05)
that they didn't have (59:05 - 59:11)
time to fully QA and it has (59:08 - 59:13)
fundamentally changed that game yeah (59:11 - 59:15)
given your experience from where that we (59:13 - 59:18)
are they made some change at the last (59:15 - 59:20)
minute or put something in that they (59:18 - 59:21)
were holding off (59:20 - 59:24)
and it unexpectedly hit the game hard (59:21 - 59:27)
well and it's not even like (59:24 - 59:29)
oh well this is It's not like there are (59:27 - 59:31)
things adding up in the game where it's (59:29 - 59:32)
like oh well this is just from an (59:31 - 59:35)
average developer right this is I mean (59:32 - 59:37)
they've made they made sword and shield (59:35 - 59:40)
they like and that you know they made (59:37 - 59:42)
Legends over the years yeah right and (59:40 - 59:43)
they didn't have the same kind of (59:42 - 59:44)
framework issues they're having now so (59:43 - 59:47)
this is different this isn't like oh (59:44 - 59:50)
game freak of course like I don't think (59:47 - 59:52)
anybody would have predicted these kind (59:50 - 59:54)
of issues coming from Game Freak not (59:52 - 59:57)
because they're an amazing developer but (59:54 - 59:59)
because they made plenty of games in the (59:57 - 60:02)
last five six years that didn't have (59:59 - 60:06)
these issues so they can do it and (60:02 - 60:08)
they've had a game you played a couple (60:06 - 60:10)
months ago or a month ago that didn't (60:08 - 60:12)
have these issues yeah so they can do it (60:10 - 60:13)
like (60:12 - 60:16)
what happened yeah the biggest question (60:13 - 60:18)
is just what happened how how did we get (60:16 - 60:19)
here (60:18 - 60:21)
because (60:19 - 60:23)
I cannot tell you how many people are (60:21 - 60:25)
super excited to play they start and (60:23 - 60:26)
then (60:25 - 60:30)
within 15 minutes (60:26 - 60:32)
I'll get the (60:30 - 60:32)
did it run this bad for you yeah it's (60:33 - 60:39)
really hard to recommend it's hard to (60:36 - 60:42)
recommend I'm like I love it I'm a super (60:39 - 60:45)
fan and I'm just chugging through but if (60:42 - 60:47)
you were on the fence or like kind of (60:45 - 60:49)
mad at the company this is gonna be like (60:47 - 60:52)
a great big underlying yes I think (60:49 - 60:54)
that's the best point that Greg has made (60:52 - 60:56)
if you are on the fence and or you did (60:54 - 60:58)
not have any good experience with sword (60:56 - 61:01)
and shield or Legends or bdsp or let's (60:58 - 61:03)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee or sun and (61:01 - 61:05)
moon or literally like the last Pokemon (61:03 - 61:07)
game you played if you did not have a (61:05 - 61:09)
good experience (61:07 - 61:11)
I would not recommend this game right (61:09 - 61:12)
now this is not winning because because (61:11 - 61:15)
it would push you farther away from the (61:12 - 61:19)
series at this point yep which is like (61:15 - 61:21)
if this game's frame rate was good I (61:19 - 61:22)
think a lot of people could see back (61:21 - 61:24)
past tree textures a lot of people could (61:22 - 61:26)
see past (61:24 - 61:28)
um you know areas being too hard or too (61:26 - 61:30)
easy because there is a lot of delight (61:28 - 61:31)
there is a lot of charm I think even (61:30 - 61:33)
people could look past you know some of (61:31 - 61:36)
the doors just being menus right but if (61:33 - 61:38)
you can't even get there without (61:36 - 61:40)
constantly thinking like why is this (61:38 - 61:42)
running so slow you're gonna put the (61:40 - 61:44)
game down yeah and if if you're putting (61:42 - 61:45)
this game down and you put down your (61:44 - 61:48)
last Pokemon game oh boy it's gonna be a (61:45 - 61:50)
real uphill battle to try to get you to (61:48 - 61:52)
buy any other Pokemon thing coming out (61:50 - 61:54)
after this yeah and that's just what it (61:52 - 61:55)
is (61:54 - 61:57)
it's really hard to recommend right now (61:55 - 61:57)
it's (61:57 - 62:00)
it's super unfortunate yeah it really is (61:57 - 62:02)
and you know what bugs me the most is (62:00 - 62:03)
you got all the tree people out there (62:02 - 62:06)
that are probably like see now it's a (62:03 - 62:07)
new game and there's new problems and (62:06 - 62:08)
there's new things (62:07 - 62:12)
like great this time it's warranted they (62:08 - 62:13)
don't move they don't look like robots (62:12 - 62:15)
and there's no tree shaking that's the (62:13 - 62:17)
that's the real problem no tree shaking (62:15 - 62:22)
uh okay we hit an hour uh let's wrap up (62:17 - 62:24)
um we will be back on Monday for a (62:22 - 62:25)
normal podcast we will probably talk (62:24 - 62:27)
about something uh scarlet and violet (62:25 - 62:29)
related you know maybe egg breeding (62:27 - 62:30)
that's a little different maybe um some (62:29 - 62:32)
stuff that you just might not know about (62:30 - 62:34)
hey like if you hit R3 that locks the (62:32 - 62:35)
map (62:34 - 62:37)
um mostly mechanical stuff mostly news (62:35 - 62:40)
related uh we'll see if an update comes (62:37 - 62:43)
hopefully you know before the holidays I (62:40 - 62:44)
think that's probably there if there is (62:43 - 62:45)
going to be an update that's probably (62:44 - 62:48)
going to be their goal so you know they (62:45 - 62:49)
