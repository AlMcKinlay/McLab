to take free to take cables this box (7:40 - 7:45)
with cables this sounds like i'm in a (7:43 - 7:47)
very privileged position of like oh wow (7:45 - 7:49)
these companies send you all these (7:47 - 7:50)
controllers and stuff but at a certain (7:49 - 7:53)
point your 20th controller is just (7:50 - 7:55)
taking up space but you're never going (7:53 - 7:57)
to use it you need a controller case no (7:55 - 8:00)
i i need to get like a glass case with (7:57 - 8:02)
slots for controllers i need to get rid (8:00 - 8:03)
of stuff (8:02 - 8:04)
well yes (8:03 - 8:06)
we all need to get rid of stuff but (8:04 - 8:08)
that's not happening anytime soon so in (8:06 - 8:10)
the meantime get a controller add things (8:08 - 8:12)
to store it platinum on the wall next to (8:10 - 8:16)
your skateboards oh boy um (8:12 - 8:17)
that wall is so empty and like the (8:16 - 8:19)
skateboards are kind of that's another (8:17 - 8:20)
topic (8:19 - 8:22)
speaking of (8:20 - 8:23)
junk and collecting things uh the (8:22 - 8:25)
trading card game (8:23 - 8:28)
hey there we go the this is also out of (8:25 - 8:30)
nowhere news i guess like the sound like (8:28 - 8:33)
look samsung's worked with bts and every (8:30 - 8:34)
other company under the sun so it's not (8:33 - 8:36)
super surprising that they eventually (8:34 - 8:40)
got to pokemon um this is out of the (8:36 - 8:42)
blue news the pokemon company this off (8:40 - 8:44)
the verge.com the pokemon company has (8:42 - 8:47)
acquired the company that prints the (8:44 - 8:51)
trading card game in the united states (8:47 - 8:52)
so that that company is called (8:51 - 8:55)
millennial millennium print group (8:52 - 8:57)
and the pokemon company has been working (8:55 - 9:01)
with them too since 2015. i don't know (8:57 - 9:03)
who was before that (9:01 - 9:04)
doesn't matter (9:03 - 9:09)
um so this this would have been before (9:04 - 9:09)
this would have been before (9:09 - 9:12)
um (9:11 - 9:15)
pokemon go and sun and moon (9:12 - 9:17)
and uh that's when they printed that big (9:15 - 9:19)
big it was uh it was xy evolutions it (9:17 - 9:22)
was like the biggest set they've ever (9:19 - 9:25)
printed because it was a throwback to (9:22 - 9:26)
blastoise charizard venusaur all that (9:25 - 9:29)
stuff that's why for until the the (9:26 - 9:31)
pokemon trout that started because of (9:29 - 9:33)
youtubers in the pandemic that's why xy (9:31 - 9:36)
evolutions could be found (9:33 - 9:38)
as far as the eye could see (9:36 - 9:40)
but now xy evolutions is actually pretty (9:38 - 9:42)
rare because (9:40 - 9:44)
those same people who (9:42 - 9:45)
bought all those packs they wanted to (9:44 - 9:47)
get the charizards because xy evolutions (9:45 - 9:49)
had like six different charizards in it (9:47 - 9:50)
um so now it's wise that evolution is (9:49 - 9:52)
actually worth quite a bit (9:50 - 9:55)
um it says quote here with this (9:52 - 9:56)
acquisition the pokemon company (9:55 - 9:58)
international aims to further develop (9:56 - 10:00)
the millennium the millennium print (9:58 - 10:02)
groups capabilities infrastructure and (10:00 - 10:04)
scale to become the premier printer of (10:02 - 10:06)
trading cards serving the broader (10:04 - 10:08)
industry (10:06 - 10:10)
millennial millennium print group will (10:08 - 10:12)
continue to operate as a separate and (10:10 - 10:15)
autonomous organization but will gain (10:12 - 10:17)
both investment and industry expertise (10:15 - 10:21)
from the pokemon company international (10:17 - 10:21)
my only question is does this mean the (10:22 - 10:25)
pokemon cards will actually be centered (10:24 - 10:26)
and no (10:25 - 10:29)
no that's out of anybody's control no (10:26 - 10:31)
the real question is what what other (10:29 - 10:33)
things does this company print now i (10:31 - 10:34)
know i have to look them up (10:33 - 10:36)
and they're not millennials stop trying (10:34 - 10:38)
to millennium i'm trying to take credit (10:36 - 10:41)
for it millennium falcon right (10:38 - 10:43)
like are they that's yes that is (10:41 - 10:46)
assuming are they are they printing mtg (10:43 - 10:47)
cards (10:46 - 10:48)
uh that's wizards of the coast is (10:47 - 10:50)
printing magic isn't there do you think (10:48 - 10:53)
wizards of the coast do you think hasbro (10:50 - 10:55)
printing hasbro has their secret (10:53 - 10:57)
printing group okay whoever okay whoever (10:55 - 10:59)

yep (11:01 - 11:05)
a park communications company i don't (11:03 - 11:06)
know what that means (11:05 - 11:08)
it's just the name of their whole name (11:06 - 11:10)
company although now they're a tpci (11:08 - 11:12)
company yeah mm-hmm i mean they're big (11:10 - 11:14)
ooh look at that thing okay but here's (11:12 - 11:16)
okay it's all robots (11:14 - 11:17)
i'm looking at the pictures there's (11:16 - 11:18)
nobody who actually works here's this (11:17 - 11:20)
robot so it's never gonna be centered (11:18 - 11:22)
because robots don't care robots don't (11:20 - 11:24)

yes are much much better than the (12:22 - 12:29)
english pokemon cards in quality (12:25 - 12:29)
and i'm saying the digimon cards are (12:29 - 12:32)
better than both of you you can't read (12:30 - 12:33)
them though no i don't think the digimon (12:32 - 12:35)
parts are that great maybe but maybe (12:33 - 12:36)
maybe (12:35 - 12:38)
maybe this means the english cards will (12:36 - 12:40)
get better because now it's one company (12:38 - 12:42)
will you set standards for both sides (12:40 - 12:43)

credit for something that's not yours (13:01 - 13:05)
millennium falcon we aim to develop the (13:03 - 13:08)
millennium into a bit better bigger (13:05 - 13:10)
this is like a kanye west song awesome (13:08 - 13:12)
better bigger a state-of-the-art version (13:10 - 13:14)
of what already (13:12 - 13:15)
um (13:14 - 13:17)
already of their exceptional (13:15 - 13:19)
organization benefiting from not pokemon (13:17 - 13:22)
but all of their customers (13:19 - 13:24)
but does that mean they're printing for (13:22 - 13:26)
other card companies i think that's what (13:24 - 13:28)
they're is what they're indicating (13:26 - 13:29)
they can't just print for themselves (13:28 - 13:31)
there's no there's not enough (13:29 - 13:34)
there's there's definitely plenty enough (13:31 - 13:35)
money in pokemon cards (13:34 - 13:37)
not enough for a company this size now (13:35 - 13:39)
you got to diversify and be in the (13:37 - 13:40)
market in a couple of different areas (13:39 - 13:42)
does it say on their website what else (13:40 - 13:44)
they're preparing for no i can't does it (13:42 - 13:45)
even say they're printing for pokemon no (13:44 - 13:47)
no (13:45 - 13:50)
no they uh (13:47 - 13:52)
definitely have uh photos of their (13:50 - 13:55)
facilities uh it's all robots it's no (13:52 - 13:56)
people (13:55 - 13:58)
uh the one person that's in there was (13:56 - 14:00)
just put in for size and scale so you (13:58 - 14:01)
can see how big the printing is they (14:00 - 14:03)
don't actually work there (14:01 - 14:05)
i find this hard to believe (14:03 - 14:07)
look that's a robot (14:05 - 14:09)
i mean this is (14:07 - 14:11)
dang i kind of just want to go to this (14:09 - 14:13)
place (14:11 - 14:13)
um i hate talking about like rumors and (14:15 - 14:20)
speculation i don't know so but here we (14:18 - 14:21)
go (14:20 - 14:23)
they do foil stamping and embossing (14:21 - 14:25)
we're getting more hollows (14:23 - 14:27)
yeah okay yeah (14:25 - 14:29)
i can't wait for the embossed pokemon (14:27 - 14:32)
cards to come out just wait (14:29 - 14:33)
so (14:32 - 14:35)
if this this rumor (14:33 - 14:37)
started happening around tuesday we're (14:35 - 14:38)
recording this on wednesday obviously (14:37 - 14:41)
this will go up on the feed on on monday (14:38 - 14:42)
but (14:41 - 14:44)
there's a bunch of people a bunch of (14:42 - 14:45)
twitter accounts bunch of websites (14:44 - 14:48)
reporting that pokemon ruby and sapphire (14:45 - 14:50)
are coming to the nintendo switch (14:48 - 14:52)
did you hear about this no like a (14:50 - 14:53)
virtual console type yeah no i haven't (14:52 - 14:56)
heard nothing (14:53 - 14:57)
why (14:56 - 14:59)
why why are people saying this is there (14:57 - 15:01)
a reason yeah yes there is actually a (14:59 - 15:02)
reason is this another oh they (15:01 - 15:05)
trademarked it no it is not but that is (15:02 - 15:07)
uh that's usually (15:05 - 15:09)
i mean that's usually what it is (15:07 - 15:11)
right there (15:09 - 15:14)
um okay so this is off uh win dot gg (15:11 - 15:16)
it's that i look they all yeah good (15:14 - 15:19)
quality news source that is win.gigi oh (15:16 - 15:21)
what is leatherman.games it's an (15:19 - 15:22)
incredible website where you get a (15:21 - 15:24)
wonderful game you've answered both (15:22 - 15:26)
questions look it's not time for the (15:24 - 15:29)
squarespace ad yet um (15:26 - 15:31)
so they're saying well my other option (15:29 - 15:33)
was to just the twitter twitter yeah (15:31 - 15:35)
right so (15:33 - 15:37)
multiple nintendo switch data miners has (15:35 - 15:39)
uh have uncovered evidence of a working (15:37 - 15:42)
game boy advance emulator on the console (15:39 - 15:44)
files and assets related to a long list (15:42 - 15:46)
of games were uncovered which include (15:44 - 15:48)
screenshots standalone apps and (15:46 - 15:50)
customized multiplayer support (15:48 - 15:53)
included in the files (15:50 - 15:54)
strongly suggest that the gen three (15:53 - 15:57)
pokemon titles including ruby sapphire (15:54 - 15:59)
uh they also had um (15:57 - 16:01)
pokemon the the pinball version of it i (15:59 - 16:03)
think it's just pokemon pinball (16:01 - 16:04)
yeah ruby and sapphire though i think (16:03 - 16:06)
it's called pokemon pinball ruby and (16:04 - 16:10)
sapphire um they were found i believe uh (16:06 - 16:13)
looking at your fusion was that this (16:10 - 16:14)
garbage (16:13 - 16:16)
details beyond the emulator's existence (16:14 - 16:20)
uh and the existence of the screenshots (16:16 - 16:21)
were scanned (16:20 - 16:23)
it is likely they would be a part of (16:21 - 16:25)
nintendo switch online it is unclear (16:23 - 16:27)
whether it will be a basic service or (16:25 - 16:29)
the expansion path service that the (16:27 - 16:31)
nintendo 64 and sega genesis games are (16:29 - 16:33)
on it is also (16:31 - 16:35)
unknown whether online multiplayer will (16:33 - 16:36)
be supported or if the games will be (16:35 - 16:39)
supported locally (16:36 - 16:41)
uh and then they talk about and they (16:39 - 16:44)
talk about some other stuff so (16:41 - 16:46)
uh they have the screenshots (16:44 - 16:48)
and if you scroll down a little bit on (16:46 - 16:49)
this website greg you can see the the (16:48 - 16:52)
screenshots of pokemon pinball and (16:49 - 16:54)
what is that like battle toads or (16:52 - 16:56)
something i don't know (16:54 - 16:56)
but it makes sense right they've already (16:56 - 16:59)
done (16:58 - 17:02)
nes they've already done snazz they've (16:59 - 17:05)
done nintendo 64. have they done (17:02 - 17:07)
what's the one that came after the 64. (17:05 - 17:09)
the box gamecube and the gamecube the (17:07 - 17:12)
box game box so they love gamebot they (17:09 - 17:14)
haven't done gamecube yet though no no (17:12 - 17:15)
but (17:14 - 17:17)
did gameboy advance come out before (17:15 - 17:20)
gamecube yeah yes so that would be the (17:17 - 17:22)
next in line (17:20 - 17:23)
because they're not going to do a (17:22 - 17:25)
gameboy because they already did that on (17:23 - 17:27)
the ds (17:25 - 17:29)
yeah well they had we remember we we had (17:27 - 17:31)
the founder pack on the the ds so we got (17:29 - 17:35)
all those gameboy ambassadors (17:31 - 17:35)
did i get the ambassador i don't think (17:37 - 17:40)
it did i mean i i can (17:38 - 17:42)
clearly see this being part of nintendo (17:40 - 17:45)
switch online yeah (17:42 - 17:47)
but here's the thing who (17:45 - 17:50)
car paddler joe who wants to play (17:47 - 17:52)
original ruby and sapphire greg (17:50 - 17:54)
leatherman when omega ruby alpha (17:52 - 17:56)
sapphire are better games but you (17:54 - 17:59)
already have killed the 3ds you do not (17:56 - 18:01)
get to say that sentence in front of me (17:59 - 18:03)
to quote shakespeare's spirit you've (18:01 - 18:05)
come to bury the 3ds not to praise it (18:03 - 18:07)
no oh okay (18:05 - 18:08)
but you don't get to say anything (18:07 - 18:11)
praiseworthy about it like you cannot (18:08 - 18:13)
you cannot being you say that they are (18:11 - 18:15)
better games (18:13 - 18:17)
you have to say i have no opinion about (18:15 - 18:18)
those games and defer to me the person (18:17 - 18:20)
that actually likes them i have played (18:18 - 18:23)
through all of both both games (18:20 - 18:25)
i did a normal play through in ruby and (18:23 - 18:27)
a (18:25 - 18:29)
bad quest shiny badge question in (18:27 - 18:31)
sapphire what's missing is emerald if (18:29 - 18:33)
amrit was in there then i would i would (18:31 - 18:34)
hands down buy it to play emeralds okay (18:33 - 18:36)
emerald (18:34 - 18:38)
let's let's pretend let's pretend this (18:36 - 18:40)
is real for a second okay pretending (18:38 - 18:41)
that it's real let's pretend that this (18:40 - 18:43)
rumor is real and ruby and sapphire are (18:41 - 18:45)
coming are they going to do the thing (18:43 - 18:47)
that they did with gold and silver on (18:45 - 18:49)
the virtual console (18:47 - 18:51)
which was we released gold and silver (18:49 - 18:53)
and then like six to eight months later (18:51 - 18:54)
we released crystal which is (18:53 - 18:58)
the better version yeah so like oh yeah (18:54 - 19:00)
if they're doing ruby and sapphire do (18:58 - 19:02)
you just say i don't need to play these (19:00 - 19:05)
right now also i can play omega ruby i (19:02 - 19:07)
will wait for emerald which is actually (19:05 - 19:09)
the better game (19:07 - 19:11)
i mean it depends on if it's coming for (19:09 - 19:13)
free like if it's a part of a package (19:11 - 19:14)
that you're already paying for display (19:13 - 19:15)
yeah it's not free but you're paying (19:14 - 19:16)
what sixteen dollars yeah if you're (19:15 - 19:18)
paying for no no no no the the the game (19:16 - 19:21)
pass thing is is okay so nintendo switch (19:18 - 19:25)
online is what 20 25 and then i don't (19:21 - 19:27)
know i pay family plan for family (19:25 - 19:30)
planners related to me 35 a year i think (19:27 - 19:32)
i paid 20. and then if you want the (19:30 - 19:34)
expansion pass that's another 25 a year (19:32 - 19:36)
what's the expansion pass that's how you (19:34 - 19:38)
play the nintendo 64 games are you sure (19:36 - 19:40)
yeah oh yeah (19:38 - 19:41)
because that's what they hit the animal (19:40 - 19:43)
crossing thing behind yeah but what i'm (19:41 - 19:44)
saying is if it's included in the (19:43 - 19:46)
expansion pass right (19:44 - 19:48)
like you're buying you upgrade to the (19:46 - 19:50)
expansion pass to play these (19:48 - 19:51)
i'm already paying for the expansion (19:50 - 19:53)
pack you don't even know what you're (19:51 - 19:54)
paying for (19:53 - 19:56)
you got that right (19:54 - 19:58)
um no (19:56 - 20:00)
i wouldn't either ma like me like but (19:58 - 20:02)
the thing is i still have my original (20:00 - 20:04)
copies so that's like not a fair (20:02 - 20:07)
question to ask but yeah i still (20:04 - 20:07)
i can go and play them and they still do (20:09 - 20:11)
play them but you can't play them on (20:10 - 20:13)
your tv but i can't play the movie tv (20:11 - 20:14)
would i (20:13 - 20:16)
gameboy here's the thing if i if i had (20:14 - 20:17)
any desire to buy the expansion pass (20:16 - 20:19)
which i don't (20:17 - 20:22)
but if i already had it would i play (20:19 - 20:23)
ruby and sapphire when they came out (20:22 - 20:25)
absolutely and even if emerald was (20:23 - 20:28)
coming down the road i since i already (20:25 - 20:29)
bought (20:28 - 20:31)
the entrance yeah i would (20:29 - 20:33)
i would play them (20:31 - 20:35)
but would are those two games going to (20:33 - 20:38)
get me to buy the expansion pass no (20:35 - 20:40)
if emerald was there yes i would buy the (20:38 - 20:42)
expansion bets for emerald yeah i think (20:40 - 20:43)
i have to play them because the only (20:42 - 20:44)
thing i've played off the expansion pass (20:43 - 20:47)
is dr mario and if i have to die knowing (20:44 - 20:50)
that that's what i spent the money on be (20:47 - 20:54)
very understood 25 on dr mario dr mario (20:50 - 20:55)
yeah i think i think that's a that's (20:54 - 20:57)
maybe a harder question for people who (20:55 - 20:58)
own these games or even a person who (20:57 - 21:01)
owns like um pokemon snap or pokemon (20:58 - 21:03)
stadium because i i don't i don't think (21:01 - 21:04)
pokemon stadiums on the expansion pass (21:03 - 21:06)
but pokemon snap is yeah um (21:04 - 21:08)
and that was not enough for me to be (21:06 - 21:10)
like i want to give you an extra 25 to (21:08 - 21:13)
play this i will say if emerald (21:10 - 21:16)
happened and they released gamecube and (21:13 - 21:18)
gale of darkness and coliseum happened (21:16 - 21:21)
yeah i would buy the expansion (21:18 - 21:23)
the the following the second (21:21 - 21:25)
well no so i think the reason you can't (21:23 - 21:26)
have stadium is because there's no way (21:25 - 21:29)
to bring in poke unless they do a (21:26 - 21:32)
pokemon home home connection (21:29 - 21:34)
connection because stadium is no good (21:32 - 21:36)
unless you can bring in your own pokemon (21:34 - 21:37)
well that's good for the mini games this (21:36 - 21:39)
this was the this was the secondary (21:37 - 21:40)
question (21:39 - 21:42)
because uh when when we were talking (21:40 - 21:43)
about virtual console by the way virtual (21:42 - 21:45)
console has not existed and for the (21:43 - 21:47)
nintendo switch it's been six years (21:45 - 21:48)
they've they're they don't use that no (21:47 - 21:50)
they're not gonna maybe one day they'll (21:48 - 21:51)
randomly bring back that branding but (21:50 - 21:53)
that that ship has sailed but virtual (21:51 - 21:55)
console on the ds (21:53 - 21:56)
and the wii (21:55 - 21:59)
and the wii u (21:56 - 22:00)
um (21:59 - 22:01)
when (22:00 - 22:03)
blue red yellow gold silver crystal well (22:01 - 22:05)
before gold silver was even announced (22:03 - 22:06)
when blue red yellow were coming and (22:05 - 22:09)
when wheels was on the show wheels and i (22:06 - 22:11)
had constant arguments of whether this (22:09 - 22:13)
would have virtual cons or or sorry (22:11 - 22:16)
pokemon bank support and i was like it (22:13 - 22:18)
seems very impossible for them to re (22:16 - 22:20)
release these games without bank support (22:18 - 22:21)
because (22:20 - 22:22)
that is (22:21 - 22:24)
the gimmick of pokemon (22:22 - 22:26)
and they didn't think it would have it (22:24 - 22:27)
and it ended up having it so that the (22:26 - 22:29)
question is (22:27 - 22:32)
if if this rumor is true i (22:29 - 22:34)
will well who cares uh if this rumor is (22:32 - 22:36)
true (22:34 - 22:38)
would it have home support (22:36 - 22:40)
and i would have to say like that would (22:38 - 22:43)
have to be a pretty big part of it too (22:40 - 22:45)
true and will it have home support (22:43 - 22:47)
before brilliant diamond china (22:45 - 22:48)
everything (22:47 - 22:50)
for billionaires (22:48 - 22:53)
what i mean (22:50 - 22:53)
they would be foolish to not have home (22:55 - 22:59)
support (22:58 - 23:02)
and but the thing is is (22:59 - 23:04)
there's not really a good reason to play (23:02 - 23:05)
these games (23:04 - 23:06)
the the (23:05 - 23:08)
good reason to play (23:06 - 23:11)
uh red and blue and yellow (23:08 - 23:13)
was everything that you did there was (23:11 - 23:14)
stuck there right like that was a dead (23:13 - 23:16)
end connection (23:14 - 23:17)
and (23:16 - 23:19)
from then on it's not been a dead end (23:17 - 23:21)
connection (23:19 - 23:24)
so if you have those games and i have (23:21 - 23:26)
i've brought my stuff from emerald up (23:24 - 23:28)
all the way up it's a not fun process (23:26 - 23:31)
but you can do it (23:28 - 23:33)
you i think you have to have some sort (23:31 - 23:34)
of support (23:33 - 23:36)
to bring those in because you've had it (23:34 - 23:37)
all along and you don't want to have a (23:36 - 23:38)
less (23:37 - 23:40)
you want a way to kill the third market (23:38 - 23:41)
of (23:40 - 23:44)
a 90 emerald copy sitting in some game (23:41 - 23:44)
shop (23:44 - 23:46)
when somebody can get it basically for (23:44 - 23:48)
25 (23:46 - 23:49)
get the same experience and upload the (23:48 - 23:51)
pokemon without having to go through (23:49 - 23:55)
that process i would hope that um (23:51 - 23:56)
putting virtual console versions of the (23:55 - 23:58)
game kills (23:56 - 24:01)
the the high market price in shops i (23:58 - 24:03)
don't know if that actually does though (24:01 - 24:05)
i mean like like i guess a good example (24:03 - 24:06)
would be like earthbound earthbound was (24:05 - 24:09)
what like a 250 dollar game and then (24:06 - 24:11)
earthbound came out on the wii u and now (24:09 - 24:12)
i believe you can play the earthbound (24:11 - 24:13)
honestly it's on the switch on the (24:12 - 24:15)
switch i don't know what (24:13 - 24:17)
a copy of earthbound costs but i also (24:15 - 24:18)
think that people going in to buy the (24:17 - 24:20)
200 copy of earthbound aren't buying to (24:18 - 24:22)
play it right they're buying they're (24:20 - 24:23)
buying the show put it on the show what (24:22 - 24:26)
i'm saying is is the only access is (24:23 - 24:28)
going to ebay to get a weird hack copy (24:26 - 24:30)
or going to a game shop and hoping and (24:28 - 24:31)
paying that there's over to price was (24:30 - 24:34)
the only option you had before (24:31 - 24:37)
and these help kill that (24:34 - 24:38)
being the only option it can help kill (24:37 - 24:40)
things like (24:38 - 24:42)
hacked copies on ebay where it's just a (24:40 - 24:43)
rom that somebody threw on a cartridge (24:42 - 24:45)
and made it look good and when you look (24:43 - 24:46)
at it you're like why is pokemon spelled (24:45 - 24:48)
wrong (24:46 - 24:49)
like well and people just want to play (24:48 - 24:51)
these old games that you've heard about (24:49 - 24:53)
yeah (24:51 - 24:54)
they are (24:53 - 24:56)
look i bought yellow cause i was super (24:54 - 24:58)
excited to play yellow again and i got (24:56 - 25:00)
halfway through and went (24:58 - 25:01)
oh this is bad (25:00 - 25:04)
i hate i hate going back in time and (25:01 - 25:07)
playing these games it is so rough yeah (25:04 - 25:09)
it is i i went well i did the whole like (25:07 - 25:11)
shiny badge quest in crystal when (25:09 - 25:13)
crystal came out and i actually had a (25:11 - 25:15)
really good time uh i think (25:13 - 25:16)
you had an audience i had an audience (25:15 - 25:19)
but i i think out of out of the gen 1 (25:16 - 25:20)
and gen 2 games like crystal is (25:19 - 25:22)
crystal's great crystal's the one that (25:20 - 25:24)
like holds up yeah crystals yellow they (25:22 - 25:25)
have four games that they were five (25:24 - 25:27)
games that they learned from (25:25 - 25:30)
yeah yellow is good in the fact that it (25:27 - 25:32)
it feels (25:30 - 25:35)
like it's the anime game because you are (25:32 - 25:37)
you are playing through the anime story (25:35 - 25:39)
line like you know jesse and james show (25:37 - 25:40)
up you get all the starters and the in (25:39 - 25:43)
the areas that they did in the anime so (25:40 - 25:45)
yellow is a fun game in the fact that if (25:43 - 25:48)
you ever watched the first season (25:45 - 25:50)
you get to play it and that's fun (25:48 - 25:53)
but the mechanics are still so bad (25:50 - 25:55)
and it's still so slow (25:53 - 25:57)
i think the reason people want to play (25:55 - 25:59)
the older games too it's like the what i (25:57 - 26:00)
think of like the lord of the rings (25:59 - 26:02)
right somebody sees the movie now and (26:00 - 26:04)
they're like well i'm going to read that (26:02 - 26:06)
book right right and it's still a boring (26:04 - 26:08)
book and there's been tremendous fantasy (26:06 - 26:10)
written this much better over time but (26:08 - 26:11)
they're still going to go back to that (26:10 - 26:13)
original still it's it's good to learn (26:11 - 26:15)
the origins yeah right it's good to play (26:13 - 26:17)
these and it's the same thing it's like (26:15 - 26:19)
i play i played my first pokemon game (26:17 - 26:20)
being sword and shield hey i want to (26:19 - 26:21)
know what the old pokemon games were (26:20 - 26:24)
like i wouldn't know how bad it was i (26:21 - 26:26)
want to know it was like walking uphill (26:24 - 26:27)
both ways (26:26 - 26:28)
uh (26:27 - 26:31)
part of this rumor being being thrown (26:28 - 26:33)
around of whether uh you know ruby and (26:31 - 26:36)
sapphire coming to to the switch was i (26:33 - 26:39)

later of like right now on countless fan (26:49 - 26:54)
forums blogs podcasts fans of pokemon (26:51 - 26:57)
truly believe that we will receive the (26:54 - 26:58)
same treatment that super mario was (26:57 - 27:00)
given the rumors circulating have given (26:58 - 27:02)
the details that nintendo released the (27:00 - 27:04)
master collection for pokemon and it (27:02 - 27:05)
will be exclusive for the nintendo (27:04 - 27:08)
switch there's good faith good faith (27:05 - 27:10)
that the master collection will feature (27:08 - 27:12)
three separate generations of pokemon so (27:10 - 27:15)
fans can experience like uh so just like (27:12 - 27:17)

other feature will the other one will (27:19 - 27:24)
feature pokemon blue silver and sapphire (27:21 - 27:24)
um (27:24 - 27:26)
and this was supposed to be 60 it was (27:24 - 27:28)
supposed to be like a box copy the two (27:26 - 27:30)
versions (27:28 - 27:31)
um (27:30 - 27:34)
there was uh there was a bunch of uh (27:31 - 27:37)
what would i say a bunch of excitement (27:34 - 27:38)
around this rumor that's an exciting (27:37 - 27:40)
rumor i mean (27:38 - 27:41)
sure (27:40 - 27:46)
[Laughter] (27:41 - 27:46)
it's gonna make a lot of things sound (27:46 - 27:49)
exciting when they're not real (27:47 - 27:52)
yeah so uh you know that was (27:49 - 27:55)
very anticipated and that was a rumor (27:52 - 27:57)
that stuck around for quite a few months (27:55 - 27:58)
and then it just kind of disappeared and (27:57 - 28:00)
then like no one really asked about it (27:58 - 28:01)
and then when i saw this ruby and (28:00 - 28:03)
sapphire rumor popping up i was like (28:01 - 28:05)
didn't do did we all forget about the (28:03 - 28:06)
master collection thing though yeah (28:05 - 28:08)
because it didn't manifest (28:06 - 28:10)
because it was fake it wasn't real (28:08 - 28:12)
like i said it (28:10 - 28:16)
the the gba stuff on switch sounds (28:12 - 28:17)
plausible it sounds (28:16 - 28:19)
like it would happen i mean (28:17 - 28:21)
nintendo recycles (28:19 - 28:23)
they sure didn't like they like to make (28:21 - 28:24)
money off of things they already did (28:23 - 28:26)
it's called brilliant damage dining park (28:24 - 28:28)
they've got me paying 30 a year for dr (28:26 - 28:29)
mario yeah (28:28 - 28:32)
and another 35 dollars maybe like we (28:29 - 28:33)
need to look at your price to have a (28:32 - 28:35)
bunch of people who aren't related to me (28:33 - 28:37)
able to play nintendo online and also (28:35 - 28:40)
play dr mario or whatever else you (28:37 - 28:41)

riddle (32:55 - 32:58)
quests (32:57 - 32:59)
more than i thought i would and a couple (32:58 - 33:01)
of them are really (32:59 - 33:03)
a lot of them are easy oh straight up or (33:01 - 33:05)
like okay i just gotta do this some of (33:03 - 33:07)
them they word them so weird i'm like (33:05 - 33:09)
what (33:07 - 33:12)
what are you talking about um last bit (33:09 - 33:14)
of news off nintendolife.com (33:12 - 33:17)
the pokemon mystery dungeon writer (33:14 - 33:19)
reflects on the ip's strengths and (33:17 - 33:22)
appeals uh so they actually pull this (33:19 - 33:24)
from um the company's website which is (33:22 - 33:27)
uh seafoam gaming but they they just (33:24 - 33:28)
pulled the good quotes here so they kind (33:27 - 33:30)
of did the work for me (33:28 - 33:33)
um quote i was influenced by everyone on (33:30 - 33:35)
the staff as you know the appeal of (33:33 - 33:36)
pokemon mystery dungeon stories come (33:35 - 33:38)
from the things like their direction and (33:36 - 33:40)
their sound just not their scenarios (33:38 - 33:42)
when we were making things together we (33:40 - 33:43)
were inspired by each other i'm so (33:42 - 33:44)
thankful for all of our staff the (33:43 - 33:46)
pokemon company also gave me a lot of (33:44 - 33:48)
advice they always have great input (33:46 - 33:51)
input on how to make each pokemon appeal (33:48 - 33:53)
really shine and the back and forth (33:51 - 33:55)
brought us some scenarios we have now so (33:53 - 33:58)
many thoughts and influences are in each (33:55 - 34:00)
pokemon (33:58 - 34:01)
there's more but that was the most (34:00 - 34:03)
generic paragraph i've ever read for (34:01 - 34:04)
example (34:03 - 34:06)
what is i don't even understand what (34:04 - 34:08)
you're trying to say this this is the (34:06 - 34:11)
the the person who wrote the story to (34:08 - 34:14)
mystery dungeon which which mystery does (34:11 - 34:16)
the x one oh (34:14 - 34:18)
the one that came out on switch that (34:16 - 34:20)
everyone forgot about yeah in about (34:18 - 34:21)
three days i played (34:20 - 34:23)
an hour i played the demo (34:21 - 34:26)
played the demo uh for example (34:23 - 34:28)
wigglytuff's line in explorers truly bad (34:26 - 34:30)
pokemon don't really exist is a line (34:28 - 34:33)
that i thought of uh and included in the (34:30 - 34:36)
story but i think it was also a central (34:33 - 34:38)
idea for the pokemon company if any uh (34:36 - 34:40)
if i had any writing advice i'd say it's (34:38 - 34:42)
the the first step is to find a good (34:40 - 34:44)
group of friends (34:42 - 34:45)
as for my favorite scene it's hard to (34:44 - 34:46)
pick a scene because i love them all i (34:45 - 34:48)
guess if i had to pick it would be the (34:46 - 34:50)
credits of the ending for the (34:48 - 34:53)
ending of explorers meeting and parting (34:50 - 34:55)
uh our comp meetings and partings our (34:53 - 34:57)
common themes of the series when the (34:55 - 34:59)
development started i thought uh i (34:57 - 35:01)
thought of expressing those themes (34:59 - 35:02)
through the bubbles at the beginning and (35:01 - 35:04)
the end of the game i was motivated to (35:02 - 35:06)
give every name (35:04 - 35:08)
and that appeared in the staff (35:06 - 35:10)
role at the end of the game like this (35:08 - 35:12)
there were there were also difficult (35:10 - 35:14)
scenes though and i had to kept pushing (35:12 - 35:17)
programmers for the bubbles to move (35:14 - 35:20)
uh people around me said that it was my (35:17 - 35:21)
magnum opus (35:20 - 35:25)
opus opus yeah that one (35:21 - 35:25)
uh and then he talks about gates to (35:25 - 35:29)
infinity it's a (35:27 - 35:31)
so the the (35:29 - 35:33)
the person interviewed here wrote a lot (35:31 - 35:35)
of the dialogue for all of the mystery (35:33 - 35:38)
dungeon games and everything but (35:35 - 35:38)
i (35:38 - 35:41)
i don't know i i was hoping when i like (35:38 - 35:42)
saw the headline of this article and i (35:41 - 35:45)
went to the like the source and i like (35:42 - 35:48)
there was way way more it just (35:45 - 35:49)
i don't know if like their hands were (35:48 - 35:50)
tied and what they were allowed to say (35:49 - 35:52)
because it was very much like i enjoyed (35:50 - 35:54)
working on the games i like pokemon the (35:52 - 35:57)
pokemon company is nice uh thank you for (35:54 - 35:58)

say that's funny what do you want to (35:58 - 36:01)
work from again (35:59 - 36:02)
you want to keep working in the business (36:01 - 36:05)
you are going to give glowing treatments (36:02 - 36:08)

are over it and they are burning the (36:08 - 36:13)
world down those people you need to find (36:11 - 36:16)
them at the height of their anger and (36:13 - 36:18)

one i think like i i don't know maybe i (36:56 - 37:01)
can't i don't know what is the turn off (36:59 - 37:03)
for these games for me i don't know if (37:01 - 37:04)
it's like (37:03 - 37:06)
when when people go explorers of the sky (37:04 - 37:08)
has the best story and it's (37:06 - 37:10)
inspirational and it's incredible like (37:08 - 37:12)
all i remember is is the coughing with (37:10 - 37:14)
the monocle and like (37:12 - 37:17)
i i none of that really like grabbed me (37:14 - 37:20)
um and it's gonna be the standard like (37:17 - 37:21)
oh you gotta watch six episodes of the (37:20 - 37:23)
anime before it gets good or you gotta (37:21 - 37:24)
wait till you get to this part of the (37:23 - 37:26)
game before it gets good but i think it (37:24 - 37:28)
i think it's just the gameplay that (37:26 - 37:29)
turns me on (37:28 - 37:30)
yeah well (37:29 - 37:32)
it is the random (37:30 - 37:35)
i like random dungeon set out and the (37:32 - 37:39)
random possibly catching other pokemon (37:35 - 37:40)
part like there's not a lot of control (37:39 - 37:42)
once you're in the dungeon that turns a (37:40 - 37:43)
lot of people off (37:42 - 37:45)
you have very limited control over how (37:43 - 37:47)
you interact you have very limited (37:45 - 37:51)
control over what happens you can lose (37:47 - 37:53)
everything in a sudden monster room you (37:51 - 37:55)
can who's people your friends can run (37:53 - 37:56)
away from you you have to go collect (37:55 - 37:59)
them like you have to really enjoy that (37:56 - 38:01)
random (37:59 - 38:03)
i don't know what flair is going in it (38:01 - 38:05)
can be super easy floor or super super (38:03 - 38:07)
hard floor and if you do not enjoy the (38:05 - 38:08)
fact that you (38:07 - 38:10)
will find a shiny pokemon and not be (38:08 - 38:12)
able to befriend it and it will just (38:10 - 38:15)
leave like those are the frustrating (38:12 - 38:17)
parts of the game that you kind of need (38:15 - 38:19)
to find charming or you hate those games (38:17 - 38:21)
do people who love mystery dungeon have (38:19 - 38:23)
they just never played diablo (38:21 - 38:25)
because like right but that's (38:23 - 38:27)
completely different (38:25 - 38:28)
no because they're both like you don't (38:27 - 38:32)
get friends in diablo you get cows (38:28 - 38:35)
you're confusing mechanics for like (38:32 - 38:38)
theme and atmosphere right i want to i (38:35 - 38:39)
loved everything about the mystery (38:38 - 38:41)
dungeon games except for going into the (38:39 - 38:44)
dungeons and having to like figure out (38:41 - 38:45)
how hungry i was gonna get and they have (38:44 - 38:47)
the apples and (38:45 - 38:49)
no thank you but everything else was (38:47 - 38:51)
great i mean okay but diablo and mystery (38:49 - 38:54)
dungeon are both dungeon crawlers (38:51 - 38:57)
yeah yeah there's like like if you were (38:54 - 38:58)
like what is the gameplay mechanic (38:57 - 38:59)
they're both dungeons they're both (38:58 - 39:01)
dungeon crawlers yes (38:59 - 39:03)
if you're going to they are vastly (39:01 - 39:04)
different is it a roguelike is it does (39:03 - 39:07)
it count as a roguelike because it's (39:04 - 39:09)
i mean it i guess it can't technically (39:07 - 39:11)
count because it resets it it resets the (39:09 - 39:13)
speed don't succeed and it's randomized (39:11 - 39:15)
and you can lose if you lose you lose (39:13 - 39:16)
your stuff in there and somebody has to (39:15 - 39:17)
go (39:16 - 39:19)
rescue it (39:17 - 39:20)
those games work great if you also have (39:19 - 39:22)
a community because if then you don't (39:20 - 39:23)
worry about passing out in the middle of (39:22 - 39:25)
a dungeon and losing everything because (39:23 - 39:28)
somebody can get it is better than you (39:25 - 39:29)
you just have to like (39:28 - 39:31)
i think the thing that turned (39:29 - 39:34)
me off the most is you can do (39:31 - 39:37)
everything possible to befriend pokemon (39:34 - 39:41)
and it's still of a one random shot (39:37 - 39:43)
and (39:41 - 39:45)
you get a chance and it's hidden from (39:43 - 39:47)
you there's not a lot you can do to fix (39:45 - 39:49)
it but other than carry the friend bow (39:47 - 39:51)
and have blah blah blah and you get all (39:49 - 39:53)
the things but it's still like i've (39:51 - 39:54)
gotten into this dungeon (39:53 - 39:56)
seven times and i'm still haven't (39:54 - 39:58)
befriended a cersket and it's (39:56 - 40:01)
maddening i know pokemon go i'm home (39:58 - 40:03)
connectivity right (40:01 - 40:05)
but the stories are generally good (40:03 - 40:07)
they're generally cute (40:05 - 40:07)
um (40:07 - 40:09)
[Music] (40:07 - 40:12)
diablo story is not cute um no well you (40:09 - 40:13)
know i don't think anyone's playing (40:12 - 40:14)
diablo for the story maybe somebody is (40:13 - 40:15)
but (40:14 - 40:16)
um (40:15 - 40:18)
uh stewart sent in these the samsung (40:16 - 40:21)
galaxy stuff from community by the way (40:18 - 40:24)
uh question of the week (40:21 - 40:25)
it's the (40:24 - 40:30)
question of the week (40:25 - 40:30)
i don't know what song that's supposed (40:31 - 40:36)
to be either i'm not getting it (40:32 - 40:36)
um (40:37 - 40:41)
this is uh this is from brandon what (40:39 - 40:43)
pokemon did you not care about until you (40:41 - 40:45)
saw it shiny (40:43 - 40:48)
oh until i saw it shiny (40:45 - 40:49)
as you guys were thinking i i have a (40:48 - 40:51)
really just uh (40:49 - 40:52)
unrelated question but it remind me of (40:51 - 40:53)
the question hence why i picked the (40:52 - 40:56)
question i was at easter with uh irene's (40:53 - 40:59)
family and um my niece (40:56 - 41:02)
my my it's just like well it's not my (40:59 - 41:03)
sister it's irene's (41:02 - 41:05)
your knees (41:03 - 41:07)
my niece-in-law it's your niece-in-law (41:05 - 41:09)
um i don't know how old she is maybe (41:07 - 41:13)
like five maybe six i so i don't know um (41:09 - 41:16)
get it together it's your family (41:13 - 41:17)
uh (41:16 - 41:21)
she i was wearing my ise hoodie (41:17 - 41:24)
and she recognized the pokeball in the s (41:21 - 41:25)
i don't know if people know this but (41:24 - 41:27)
when it says it's super effective the s (41:25 - 41:28)
makes a pokeball she was like this is (41:27 - 41:31)
pokemon and i was like whoa like (41:28 - 41:32)
you know that that's a pokeball that's (41:31 - 41:34)
like really cool and i was like what's (41:32 - 41:36)
your favorite pokemon and of course you (41:34 - 41:38)
know i expected her to say pikachu (41:36 - 41:40)
and she said evie (41:38 - 41:42)
and i was like oh wow (41:40 - 41:44)
good choice that's a good choice it's (41:42 - 41:47)
from the one and i um (41:44 - 41:49)
i was playing pokemon go because it was (41:47 - 41:50)
that battle the go battle day or (41:49 - 41:52)
whatever and two to ten battles get a (41:50 - 41:54)
bunch of experience so i finished that (41:52 - 41:55)
and she came over (41:54 - 41:58)
and she was like oh pokemon like she (41:55 - 41:59)
recognized what it was and then she was (41:58 - 42:00)
like do you have an eevee and i was like (41:59 - 42:02)
yeah and i showed her an eevee with the (42:00 - 42:04)
the like hat and then i started the evie (42:02 - 42:05)
with the flowers and she's like oh these (42:04 - 42:07)
are really pretty and then i showed her (42:05 - 42:08)
a shiny eevee and she was like oh i (42:07 - 42:10)
really like this one but like i didn't (42:08 - 42:11)
say it was shiny or anything yeah it's (42:10 - 42:13)
like this one has a hat this one has (42:11 - 42:15)
flowers this one's like silver (42:13 - 42:17)
um and (42:15 - 42:18)
then i showed her the whole pokemon list (42:17 - 42:20)
in the pokedex and she was like pointing (42:18 - 42:22)
out one she liked and she was like i (42:20 - 42:23)
like gardevoir for some reason she was (42:22 - 42:26)
like i like tropius gardevoir and (42:23 - 42:27)
trophies are great yeah people like (42:26 - 42:29)
trophies got bananas (42:27 - 42:32)
she liked mew and then i would flip (42:29 - 42:33)
between me i would flip between the (42:32 - 42:35)
shiny version and the not shiny version (42:33 - 42:36)
and every single time she picked the (42:35 - 42:38)
show i i like i didn't say like this (42:36 - 42:39)
one's more rare i was just like these (42:38 - 42:40)
are two different colors and she picked (42:39 - 42:41)
it up (42:40 - 42:43)
every time it was a eyeglass exam yeah (42:41 - 42:46)
which which do you prefer (42:43 - 42:47)
mewtwo (42:46 - 42:48)
better like this so i just thought that (42:47 - 42:51)
was interesting uh okay i have an answer (42:48 - 42:52)
okay hair across (42:51 - 42:54)
oh that's a good one hair cross is a (42:52 - 42:55)
really good shiny when i realized the (42:54 - 42:57)
haircuts was pink (42:55 - 42:59)
sold (42:57 - 43:00)
because i don't really care about hair (42:59 - 43:02)
across so the design is whatever design (43:00 - 43:05)
is very very very buggy (43:02 - 43:07)
which is not a favorite of mine (43:05 - 43:09)
and (43:07 - 43:12)
if anybody asks n there's never been a (43:09 - 43:13)
mechanical that i've liked simply (43:12 - 43:15)
because of its shiny you know that is (43:13 - 43:17)
not a selling point (43:15 - 43:19)
it will never it's not going to be like (43:17 - 43:21)
ooh (43:19 - 43:24)
it's colored better well your answer i i (43:21 - 43:25)
find this question incredibly (43:24 - 43:27)
presumptive and i'm like i want to like (43:25 - 43:28)
put out an announcement stop making (43:27 - 43:30)
these presumptive questions there is no (43:28 - 43:32)
pokemon that i didn't like until i saw (43:30 - 43:34)
it shiny i can't answer that question (43:32 - 43:35)
okay all right it's like i like the (43:34 - 43:37)
pokemon and then it had this i like that (43:35 - 43:39)
too for me it's not that i didn't like (43:37 - 43:41)
it it's that there's no conversion (43:39 - 43:43)
whether whether or not i would actively (43:41 - 43:45)
want to hunt for it (43:43 - 43:47)
like would i want to go into legends (43:45 - 43:49)
arceus and hunt for the (43:47 - 43:51)
and i would hunt for the arrogance but (43:49 - 43:53)
like heracross i would pass but i would (43:51 - 43:55)
hunt for a shiny hair across think of a (43:53 - 43:57)
time where i've specifically looked up a (43:55 - 43:59)
shiny of a pokemon other than like i (43:57 - 44:00)
caught the pokemon and it was shiny it (43:59 - 44:03)
was like oh i got the shiny one (44:00 - 44:04)
yay (44:03 - 44:06)
yeah um (44:04 - 44:08)
all right well i we'll pokemon out of (44:06 - 44:09)
the week in the morning did we have it (44:08 - 44:11)
not a youtube one uh (44:09 - 44:13)
well look we're on time limit this week (44:11 - 44:15)
all right all right all right uh so last (44:13 - 44:16)
week i didn't i didn't bring my notepad (44:15 - 44:18)
so i mean (44:16 - 44:19)
you're gonna get it it's really easy so (44:18 - 44:21)
last week's i specifically brought up (44:19 - 44:23)
pokemon legends arceus (44:21 - 44:26)
um talked about alternate region forms (44:23 - 44:27)
and (44:26 - 44:29)
that something is a particular (44:27 - 44:31)
line what i implied was it's part of the (44:29 - 44:34)
evolution line that nobody particularly (44:31 - 44:35)
likes (44:34 - 44:38)
reference to i-70 in ohio it was (44:35 - 44:40)
irrelevant (44:38 - 44:42)
and (44:40 - 44:44)
in basically what i said was in pokemon (44:42 - 44:46)
legends arceus it's the only one of that (44:44 - 44:48)
kind that got a regional form and then i (44:46 - 44:50)
said it could be described as the (44:48 - 44:52)
kleenex but the original was the kleenex (44:50 - 44:55)
pokemon but the new form is like the (44:52 - 44:59)
letters you receive in your post box (44:55 - 45:01)
it's (44:59 - 45:04)
kleenex mom there's no kleenex mom this (45:01 - 45:07)
isn't digimon my heart wants to say (45:04 - 45:08)
gudra (45:07 - 45:10)
well you're very close (45:08 - 45:12)
but i forget what the other ones are (45:10 - 45:15)
uh sligoo and yumi so it's lagoon (45:12 - 45:17)
i can never remember i remember gumi (45:15 - 45:20)
i remember goodra because nobody likes (45:17 - 45:22)
the second evolutions nobody cares well (45:20 - 45:23)
i care about you i didn't care about (45:22 - 45:25)
some of them just not that one when i (45:23 - 45:27)
saw that i went is that on a show (45:25 - 45:30)
yeah and i went why (45:27 - 45:32)
it's worse but it is the only middle (45:30 - 45:34)
evolution in legends arceus that got an (45:32 - 45:36)
alternate form (45:34 - 45:38)
oh yeah yeah yeah that's that's what i (45:36 - 45:40)
said in the clip yeah (45:38 - 45:42)
that's what it was (45:40 - 45:44)
pokedex entry in moon contains an error (45:42 - 45:47)
it's slime is referred to as uh uh well (45:44 - 45:49)
it's just a typo it's supposed to say (45:47 - 45:52)
mucus they put no in the word mucus uh (45:49 - 45:53)
where that's the canadian spelling (45:52 - 45:55)
clearly clearly uh slugu is the (45:53 - 45:57)
currently the only pokemon to evolve (45:55 - 45:59)
during a weather condition hasuyan (45:57 - 46:01)
sluggoo shares the category with shelmet (45:59 - 46:04)
they're both known as the snail pokemon (46:01 - 46:07)
all right what's uh next week wait (46:04 - 46:08)
oh wait but the original sligoo is the (46:07 - 46:11)
swapped tissue pokemon that's why i said (46:08 - 46:13)
the kleenex oh yeah there you go all (46:11 - 46:15)
right so it's called the soft tissue (46:13 - 46:18)
tissue pokemon yeah i know it could have (46:15 - 46:20)
been worse all right here we go in (46:18 - 46:22)
pokemon black and white one of the eight (46:20 - 46:24)
gyms can potentially have a different (46:22 - 46:26)
gym leader depending on which version of (46:24 - 46:28)
the game you are playing both of these (46:26 - 46:31)
gym leaders use the same three pokemon (46:28 - 46:34)
out of these three pokemon two are of (46:31 - 46:36)
the same evolutionary line and one (46:34 - 46:38)
stands out as a pokemon that does not (46:36 - 46:42)
evolve at all or have a pre-evolution (46:38 - 46:44)
while it is known as the cave pokemon it (46:42 - 46:46)
can only be found in a tower in pokemon (46:44 - 46:49)
black and white that's easy enough yes (46:46 - 46:50)
all right (46:49 - 46:52)
well we tried shadow right there we (46:50 - 46:53)
