what's up everyone welcome to the 509th (0:24 - 0:29)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:27 - 0:31)
super effective i am your host steve (0:29 - 0:33)
with me is will (0:31 - 0:34)
i (0:33 - 0:37)
just fyi don't ever (0:34 - 0:41)
get me uh tetris or puyo puyo game (0:37 - 0:43)
i'm currently obsessed and can't do (0:41 - 0:45)
anything else with my life until i (0:43 - 0:46)
master (0:45 - 0:48)
tetris and puyo puyo who made this (0:46 - 0:50)
mistake of giving this to you the the (0:48 - 0:52)
person who was sitting next to you last (0:50 - 0:53)
night (0:52 - 0:55)
my heterosexual life partner (0:53 - 0:57)
why i mean (0:55 - 0:59)
the question is why would such a person (0:57 - 1:02)
do this because okay so puyo puyo tetris (0:59 - 1:03)
two (1:02 - 1:04)
is (1:03 - 1:07)
you can do four player competitive ah (1:04 - 1:10)
and we have occasionally done that with (1:07 - 1:12)
me always coming in last so now i have (1:10 - 1:15)
my own copied so that i can practice (1:12 - 1:17)
but if you know nothing of the puyo puyo (1:15 - 1:19)
it is about strategy and complex (1:17 - 1:22)
strategy and it's real hard (1:19 - 1:23)
and i'm obsessed because one of the (1:22 - 1:25)
levels i can only i've only gotten up to (1:23 - 1:27)
two stars i'm like but there's three (1:25 - 1:28)
stars i have to be able to get three (1:27 - 1:30)
stars if there's three stars (1:28 - 1:32)
yes (1:30 - 1:34)
tetris is the first the last game i've (1:32 - 1:36)
imported (1:34 - 1:38)
yes i remember that night if (1:36 - 1:40)
long time podcast listeners will think (1:38 - 1:43)
back to 2015 when i tried to fall asleep (1:40 - 1:44)
on your couch and you left puyo puyo (1:43 - 1:48)
tetris one running on your playstation (1:44 - 1:50)
and it screamed at me in japanese every (1:48 - 1:51)
15 minutes (1:50 - 1:53)
yeah that was accurate why were we why (1:51 - 1:55)
were you at my house why were you (1:53 - 1:57)
leaving that on (1:55 - 1:58)
oh (1:57 - 1:59)
why was it on because we were going to (1:58 - 2:02)
play and then will fell asleep (1:59 - 2:03)
no (2:02 - 2:05)
that was it was like three o'clock in (2:03 - 2:07)
the morning we had stayed up literally (2:05 - 2:11)
all night for some dumb reason watching (2:07 - 2:12)
videos (2:11 - 2:14)
we were i think we were watching we (2:12 - 2:15)
weren't even watching (2:14 - 2:18)
no we weren't even watching the (2:15 - 2:21)
quote unquote good (2:18 - 2:23)
twitch plays pokemon we were playing the (2:21 - 2:26)
subsequent one where they did pokemon (2:23 - 2:28)
stadium and it was like random pokemon (2:26 - 2:30)
pokemon stadium (2:28 - 2:32)
up until three o'clock in the morning (2:30 - 2:34)
you bet whether the blue team won or the (2:32 - 2:36)
red team one and then be like red team (2:34 - 2:39)
has like a paris a dratini uh mewtwo and (2:36 - 2:42)
then blue team had like blastoise (2:39 - 2:44)
dratiti uh (2:42 - 2:45)
charmander and you'd be like oh i think (2:44 - 2:46)
the (2:45 - 2:51)
so either way there were some (2:46 - 2:51)
broke again there were some milwaukee (2:52 - 2:56)
locals that steve escorted out the door (2:54 - 2:59)
and left puyo puyo on (2:56 - 2:59)
i don't recall this greg is here i (3:00 - 3:05)
don't have please do tetris (3:03 - 3:07)
i have (3:05 - 3:09)
merged mansion (3:07 - 3:12)
spring event (3:09 - 3:12)
yeah (3:12 - 3:16)
merge mansion is a game i only started (3:13 - 3:20)
playing because of (3:16 - 3:22)
their ads (3:20 - 3:25)
mainly because of their ads as described (3:22 - 3:29)
by the game theorist youtube channel (3:25 - 3:29)
and they have kathy bates in them so i (3:30 - 3:33)
was like well what is this game that can (3:32 - 3:36)
afford kathy bates (3:33 - 3:39)
and then i started playing and it's (3:36 - 3:41)
done anything is advertised right yeah (3:39 - 3:43)
well no it is it is exactly as (3:41 - 3:46)
advertised but it's a dumb game and it (3:43 - 3:49)
just is there to eat up the 10 minutes (3:46 - 3:50)
of my time where i'm like i don't want (3:49 - 3:52)
to do any thinking (3:50 - 3:56)
i just want to slide things together (3:52 - 3:56)
why don't you play cafe mix (3:56 - 4:00)
is it a vertical game or a horizontal (4:03 - 4:06)
game it is a (4:04 - 4:09)
vertical game interesting (4:06 - 4:13)
if only cafe mix was vertical look (4:09 - 4:16)
turning a phone isn't hard (4:13 - 4:18)
it is designed to do that it has (4:16 - 4:22)
mechanisms made in there to flip it out (4:18 - 4:25)
vertical games are more fun to play no (4:22 - 4:26)
what (4:25 - 4:27)
that is (4:26 - 4:30)
you get the most bizarre lessons out of (4:27 - 4:32)
things people tell you (4:30 - 4:34)
like i don't know how the rabbits in (4:32 - 4:37)
your brain interpret things for you but (4:34 - 4:40)
it is always wrong (4:37 - 4:42)
i'm just saying lift cafe mix was (4:40 - 4:44)
vertical i'd be playing it every single (4:42 - 4:46)
day (4:44 - 4:48)
no you wouldn't no you wouldn't it's a (4:46 - 4:51)
swirling game it's like a swirl i don't (4:48 - 4:54)
mind number two gripe of the day thank (4:51 - 4:56)
you for reminding me i was listening to (4:54 - 4:58)
one of our episodes from maybe three to (4:56 - 5:01)
four weeks ago and somehow (4:58 - 5:05)
somehow i missed when you totally (5:01 - 5:07)
trashed (5:05 - 5:10)
probably my favorite pokemon game of all (5:07 - 5:12)
time (5:10 - 5:12)
ranger pokemon ranger because you greg (5:12 - 5:17)
you missed it as well because you're (5:15 - 5:20)
like nobody wants to take their stylist (5:17 - 5:22)
and destroy their ds (5:20 - 5:24)
second screen by swirl by writing (5:22 - 5:27)
circles on it and that that was such a (5:24 - 5:29)
mistake i'm like how dare you how did i (5:27 - 5:31)
not catch (5:29 - 5:34)
you were you on the episode yes (5:31 - 5:34)
look (5:34 - 5:37)
i have to explain to people (5:34 - 5:38)
ninety percent of the time i'm not (5:37 - 5:41)
listening to a thing steve says clearly (5:38 - 5:43)
that's why the show works out so well (5:41 - 5:44)
yes (5:43 - 5:45)
uh all right we've got spoken my news (5:44 - 5:48)
today do we yeah we do i got i got news (5:45 - 5:50)
articles here (5:48 - 5:53)
uh first bit of news is off destructoid (5:50 - 5:56)
pokemon unite hits 70 million downloads (5:53 - 5:58)
worldwide this is actually posted like a (5:56 - 6:01)
day ago some relatively fresh news here (5:58 - 6:03)
the pokemon company reports that over (6:01 - 6:05)
seven million people were well seven (6:03 - 6:06)
million maybe 7 million devices i don't (6:05 - 6:07)
know i don't know how they're (6:06 - 6:09)
classifying maybe like fresh accounts (6:07 - 6:10)
with emails (6:09 - 6:12)
70 million people worldwide have grabbed (6:10 - 6:14)
the game (6:12 - 6:15)
while (6:14 - 6:17)
while the figure wasn't broken down and (6:15 - 6:19)
of course does not denote active players (6:17 - 6:21)
the number comes from a (6:19 - 6:24)
new japanese youtube ad (6:21 - 6:26)
uh the subtext that says 70 million (6:24 - 6:30)
pokemon unite downloads mark uh include (6:26 - 6:34)
both mobile and switch editions (6:30 - 6:35)
and then destructoid goes on to say (6:34 - 6:37)
unite hasn't changed much in the past (6:35 - 6:38)
few months (6:37 - 6:39)
yeah (6:38 - 6:41)
yeah that's true for the most part we (6:39 - 6:43)
get a new character every so often (6:41 - 6:44)
yeah (6:43 - 6:47)
uh there's a polarizing (6:44 - 6:49)
limited time event a whole bunch of (6:47 - 6:52)
login bonuses uh for some sort of (6:49 - 6:54)
currency they note cowboy (6:52 - 6:56)
cowboy parana (6:54 - 6:59)
easter egg paraphernalia easter eggs is (6:56 - 7:02)
happening now cowboy paraphernalia is (6:59 - 7:04)
gone you know that is i i like reading (7:02 - 7:06)
that out loud because if you haven't (7:04 - 7:07)
logged into unite for a long time and (7:06 - 7:08)
you log in (7:07 - 7:10)
and then you're like why am i getting (7:08 - 7:12)
music notes (7:10 - 7:14)
you get music notes (7:12 - 7:17)
easter eggs right now (7:14 - 7:19)
you know there are 70 million (7:17 - 7:22)
downloads and five people know to switch (7:19 - 7:25)
to dreadnaught (7:22 - 7:25)
look i played again this morning i am (7:27 - 7:33)
very close to 1600 and it is (7:29 - 7:33)
weekends are nightmare fuel (7:33 - 7:38)
i still believe (7:36 - 7:41)
that when they put unite up on the the (7:38 - 7:44)
the world stage or whatever (7:41 - 7:46)
and people actually are kind of forced (7:44 - 7:47)
to watch it because they're putting on (7:46 - 7:48)
pokemon for the weekend to watch all (7:47 - 7:50)
these battles through the tcg or (7:48 - 7:52)
everything (7:50 - 7:53)
i feel like you're we're going to see a (7:52 - 7:56)
big bump incorrectly and (7:53 - 7:58)
people being like nah nah nah because (7:56 - 7:59)
but that's what happened with pokken (7:58 - 8:01)
tournament we're like we're like waiting (7:59 - 8:02)
in line to play let's go pikachu let's (8:01 - 8:04)
go evie (8:02 - 8:06)
at in nashville (8:04 - 8:08)
they put up they put up pokken (8:06 - 8:10)
tournament because they got finals and (8:08 - 8:13)
every like every single person in that (8:10 - 8:14)
arena wasn't really arena was a (8:13 - 8:17)
conference center uh was glued to that (8:14 - 8:20)
tv okay maybe your definition of a big (8:17 - 8:23)
bump is different than my definition of (8:20 - 8:25)
a big bump if a bunch of pokemon nerds (8:23 - 8:27)
are to pick it up again for about five (8:25 - 8:29)
minutes i don't consider that a big bump (8:27 - 8:31)
i mean also you put anything on tv while (8:29 - 8:32)
people are waiting in line they are (8:31 - 8:34)
going to be glued to the television what (8:32 - 8:37)
else 2022 exactly no no no see greg's (8:34 - 8:39)
never been to a world (8:37 - 8:41)
championship tournament (8:39 - 8:42)
when (8:41 - 8:44)
when here's a really good example when (8:42 - 8:47)
we were when we were me will and a bunch (8:44 - 8:48)
of other people (8:47 - 8:50)
were at the 2019 (8:48 - 8:53)
dc world championship (8:50 - 8:56)
and they showed the trailer of like (8:53 - 8:59)
you can't fake out dynamax pokemon (8:56 - 9:01)
here's like room service for trick room (8:59 - 9:03)
like they showed like the like six or (9:01 - 9:06)
seven like new mechanics they had around (9:03 - 9:07)
dynamaxx (9:06 - 9:11)
and that entire conference center lit up (9:07 - 9:13)
you would have thought (9:11 - 9:16)
that the national decks slash (9:13 - 9:18)
the tree haters of sword and shield were (9:16 - 9:20)
the quietest people in the world because (9:18 - 9:22)
of how (9:20 - 9:24)
excited (9:22 - 9:26)
that entire conference how does that (9:24 - 9:29)
change what i said (9:26 - 9:29)
because like you're underestimating like (9:29 - 9:32)
what (9:31 - 9:35)
people like see with their eyes like (9:32 - 9:37)
i've seen firsthand somebody who had (9:35 - 9:40)
zero interest in pokemon watch (9:37 - 9:43)
the black black two white two finals and (9:40 - 9:46)
walk out buying a ds and a copy of black (9:43 - 9:49)
two white two and then a weak minded (9:46 - 9:50)
individual (9:49 - 9:51)
okay (9:50 - 9:54)
how does that translate into long-term (9:51 - 9:56)
performance and not in the moment (9:54 - 9:59)
interest like i said it was like you put (9:56 - 10:02)
anything on a tv when people are at an (9:59 - 10:03)
event and you advertise the thing that (10:02 - 10:05)
they're at the event for people are (10:03 - 10:07)
going to be excited about it how does (10:05 - 10:09)
that translate into once you leave the (10:07 - 10:11)
event and you come down from the crowd (10:09 - 10:15)
high that you are still into that thing (10:11 - 10:17)
because that because unite is better (10:15 - 10:19)
than it was (10:17 - 10:21)
they they played unite when it was bad (10:19 - 10:24)
unite is in a significantly better place (10:21 - 10:27)
they see unite they get excited about it (10:24 - 10:29)
they play it and now they're like this (10:27 - 10:31)
is a better game and they play it for (10:29 - 10:32)
five minutes nobody goes to dreadnought (10:31 - 10:34)
and they bail (10:32 - 10:39)
exactly like like what's happening now (10:34 - 10:39)
okay greg how do you expect people to (10:40 - 10:45)
play unite then you're the one playing (10:43 - 10:47)
it every day tell us how tell us your (10:45 - 10:49)
enjoyment of how new fans are supposed (10:47 - 10:51)
to get into unite please they're not (10:49 - 10:53)
be gone (10:51 - 10:54)
learn what you're supposed to do and (10:53 - 10:58)
come back after you've had some lessons (10:54 - 10:58)
if the world championship isn't going to (10:59 - 11:03)
get new people in i don't know what at (11:01 - 11:04)
this point because i don't think it's a (11:03 - 11:05)
zoomer (11:04 - 11:06)
well (11:05 - 11:11)

this is very similar to the whole uh we (13:34 - 13:39)

blah so if you know any time you make a (13:39 - 13:44)

little bit of that fundraising here (13:48 - 13:52)
number one (13:50 - 13:54)
they they they've set the goal so low (13:52 - 13:55)
that they know (13:54 - 13:57)
no matter what happens if the goal is (13:55 - 13:58)
going to get hit they're going to plant (13:57 - 13:59)
all those trees (13:58 - 14:01)
number two and this is the real secret (13:59 - 14:03)
that the matching gives is even if the (14:01 - 14:06)
goal is not hit those people (14:03 - 14:07)
contribute the money because they want (14:06 - 14:09)
to get the tax right off so they're (14:07 - 14:11)
going to plant the trees anyways (14:09 - 14:13)
it's like a kickstarter they're like (14:11 - 14:15)

don't want to enter the tournament (17:10 - 17:14)
and then also wait it's on facebook (17:13 - 17:16)

i'm next to steve by default i will (19:12 - 19:17)
always look okay you cannot (19:15 - 19:20)
set your level to the lowest common (19:17 - 19:23)
denominator (19:20 - 19:23)
look i'm married what am i hunting for (19:24 - 19:28)

between me and the two of you (19:28 - 19:34)
i mean i'm not on the hunt anymore i (19:31 - 19:37)

have preen my plumage to attract (19:38 - 19:42)
the other roosters (19:41 - 19:47)
[Laughter] (19:42 - 19:49)
all right speaking of pokemon go a (19:47 - 19:52)
little bit off topic here but (19:49 - 19:54)
a pokemon go creator niantic is (19:52 - 19:56)
releasing a new game (19:54 - 19:58)
it's an augmented reality pet game (19:56 - 19:59)
called (19:58 - 20:01)
perry dot i think it's how you say it (19:59 - 20:04)
peridot p-e-r-i-d-o-t (20:01 - 20:06)
i think it's well they call the creature (20:04 - 20:07)
dots (20:06 - 20:09)
okay that's fine is it (20:07 - 20:12)
p-e-r-i-d-o-t yes that's peridot that's (20:09 - 20:16)
a french word oh okay we got it (20:12 - 20:16)
um (20:17 - 20:21)
in peridot we'll go with will's (20:19 - 20:24)
pronunciation users will care for raise (20:21 - 20:26)
and breed virtual pets sort of like (20:24 - 20:28)
modern day iphone version it's like sort (20:26 - 20:30)
of like a modern day iphone version of a (20:28 - 20:32)
tamagotchi the pets are called the (20:30 - 20:34)
peridots or dots for short and players (20:32 - 20:38)
will raise them from birth (20:34 - 20:38)
it says quote after thousands of years (20:38 - 20:42)
of slumber (20:41 - 20:44)
dots for shorts are (20:42 - 20:47)
peridots or dots for shorts are waking (20:44 - 20:50)
to a world vastly different from which (20:47 - 20:52)
they used to room and they need our help (20:50 - 20:55)
to protect them from extinction (20:52 - 20:55)
it's thrilling uh you'll (20:55 - 21:01)
you'll foster your own peridot's as you (20:58 - 21:02)
embark on this experience these (21:01 - 21:06)
creatures who feel so real you'll love (21:02 - 21:07)
every moment of raising them from birth (21:06 - 21:09)
to adulthood while you explore the world (21:07 - 21:12)
together you'll be able to get you will (21:09 - 21:13)
be able to learn more about your cute (21:12 - 21:15)
new friends develop a bond as you (21:13 - 21:17)
nurture and play with them and work with (21:15 - 21:22)
other players to diversify their spaces (21:17 - 21:22)
oh did you grab more go yeah sorry that (21:23 - 21:28)
was that was the quote from the game (21:25 - 21:29)
itself (21:28 - 21:30)
um (21:29 - 21:31)
and then oh sorry this is off (21:30 - 21:33)
macrumors.com uh players will care for (21:31 - 21:35)
their peridot's take them on walks meet (21:33 - 21:38)
their desires play games explore places (21:35 - 21:39)
discover hidden treasure around the (21:38 - 21:41)
world take photos all of this sounds (21:39 - 21:45)
like pokemon go and unlock a new peridot (21:41 - 21:48)
archetype through breeding (21:45 - 21:48)
there is a soft launch in select markets (21:50 - 21:55)
in the near future company plans to (21:53 - 21:56)
iterate on gameplay experience during (21:55 - 21:58)
the test period those who want to learn (21:56 - 22:00)
more can sign up for the newsletter on (21:58 - 22:02)
niantic's site (22:00 - 22:04)
niantic was best known for pokemon go (22:02 - 22:07)
they also developed ingress they also (22:04 - 22:08)
developed harry potter wizards unite (22:07 - 22:10)
which did not prove to be popular with (22:08 - 22:12)
users and wizards unite shut down on (22:10 - 22:16)
january 31st 2022 (22:12 - 22:16)
well the first thing i wanted to say was (22:17 - 22:20)
it's absolutely amazing that if you look (22:18 - 22:21)
up (22:20 - 22:23)
and now the things that i've looked up (22:21 - 22:25)
say it's pronounced peridot which i just (22:23 - 22:28)
think sounds awful um (22:25 - 22:31)
if you look it up it's a gemstone (22:28 - 22:35)
but the page that comes up on google (22:31 - 22:37)
has images of the gemstone (22:35 - 22:40)
and the character from stevens (22:37 - 22:42)
stephen universe character is the one (22:40 - 22:45)
that matters (22:42 - 22:45)
um (22:46 - 22:49)
my second comment is (22:47 - 22:50)
how come they can have breeding in this (22:49 - 22:52)
game but we can't get breeding in (22:50 - 22:55)
pokemon go what what (22:52 - 22:58)
he probably doesn't want it (22:55 - 22:58)
i (23:01 - 23:05)
with like i'd be very curious what this (23:02 - 23:07)
transformers game looks like (23:05 - 23:09)
because well it's more than meets the (23:07 - 23:11)
eye (23:09 - 23:11)
when um (23:14 - 23:18)
when harry potter came out (23:15 - 23:19)
there was like a lot of things in harry (23:18 - 23:21)
potter where i was like oh man what if (23:19 - 23:23)
they added this to pogo (23:21 - 23:24)
like (23:23 - 23:25)
like when harry potter came out it was (23:24 - 23:28)
like oh niantic can do this (23:25 - 23:29)
when's this coming to po and then it (23:28 - 23:30)
never did (23:29 - 23:32)
and then obviously harry potter shut (23:30 - 23:35)
down and then in like pikmin bloom (23:32 - 23:38)
there's like (23:35 - 23:40)
why doesn't pogo do this (23:38 - 23:42)
like again niantic has proven that they (23:40 - 23:43)
can do this (23:42 - 23:46)
and pogo doesn't do this (23:43 - 23:47)
so (23:46 - 23:49)
i to be fair i haven't played ingress in (23:47 - 23:51)
in like eight years so i have no clue (23:49 - 23:53)
what ingress is doing right now um and i (23:51 - 23:55)
don't know when this transformers game (23:53 - 23:57)
is going to come out but (23:55 - 23:59)
transformers is (23:57 - 24:01)
owned by somebody (23:59 - 24:04)
who on a town (24:01 - 24:04)
yeah so i'm curious of what hasbro's (24:09 - 24:13)
restrictions they have for niantic are (24:11 - 24:14)
obviously the pokemon company has a (24:13 - 24:16)
bunch of restrictions for niantic (24:14 - 24:18)
i'm sure there was some restrictions (24:16 - 24:20)
from warner brothers (24:18 - 24:22)
for harry potter but if this is their (24:20 - 24:24)
like oh and obviously nintendo probably (24:22 - 24:27)
has restrictions on pikmin (24:24 - 24:28)
if this is their own like this is (24:27 - 24:31)
exciting to me because like (24:28 - 24:34)
this is their own game they have no boss (24:31 - 24:35)
like they haven't had their own game (24:34 - 24:37)
since ingress (24:35 - 24:40)
so if if they're taking everything (24:37 - 24:41)
they've learned from (24:40 - 24:43)
pokemon go and obviously these are all (24:41 - 24:44)
different teams right the first people (24:43 - 24:46)
working on pokemon go aren't the same (24:44 - 24:48)
people working on pikmin but i'm (24:46 - 24:50)
assuming they're on the same well maybe (24:48 - 24:52)
everyone's remote but (24:50 - 24:54)
they're at least all in the same slack (24:52 - 24:56)
channel (24:54 - 24:59)
[Laughter] (24:56 - 25:00)
but like a lot of the things they listed (24:59 - 25:02)
of like (25:00 - 25:03)
walking exploring working together (25:02 - 25:07)
taking pictures playing with your uh (25:03 - 25:09)
dots like these are all things that are (25:07 - 25:11)
already in pogo so (25:09 - 25:13)
is it going to be as money grabby is it (25:11 - 25:17)
gonna be as tedious is (25:13 - 25:18)
like what (25:17 - 25:21)
the the spell thing in harry potter was (25:18 - 25:25)
not as fun as the catching thing in pogo (25:21 - 25:25)
um (25:25 - 25:27)
[Music] (25:25 - 25:28)
so (25:27 - 25:30)
but there is really nothing for pikmin (25:28 - 25:32)
that's kind of like the the downfall (25:30 - 25:33)
like when you're walking in pikmin you (25:32 - 25:36)
are just literally walking (25:33 - 25:38)
i haven't that's the reason why i don't (25:36 - 25:39)
open that game very often because (25:38 - 25:41)
nothing's happening oh i play it every (25:39 - 25:43)
day (25:41 - 25:46)
i gotta get my mushrooms every day (25:43 - 25:46)
uh greg you have any thoughts on this (25:47 - 25:50)
game (25:48 - 25:50)
uh (25:52 - 25:55)
it has to be really good for me to want (25:53 - 25:58)
to do a tactic because it sounds (25:55 - 26:01)
like the creature is very time consuming (25:58 - 26:03)
and very needy (26:01 - 26:06)
much like a real cat i'm not into that (26:03 - 26:09)
i'm not into it being super needy at me (26:06 - 26:12)
i needed to be like (26:09 - 26:14)
i'm glad you stopped by for 10 minutes (26:12 - 26:17)
i'll see you in 24 hours anything more (26:14 - 26:19)
than that and i'm out i don't have room (26:17 - 26:24)
for that kind of neediness in my life (26:19 - 26:24)
also it has to be very cute the other (26:24 - 26:28)
thing is it has to be super super super (26:27 - 26:33)
cute and it is not super cute i am out (26:28 - 26:33)
uh what about you will (26:34 - 26:40)
i don't have real pets why would i want (26:36 - 26:42)
virtual ones you had real pets (26:40 - 26:46)
had correct tense (26:42 - 26:46)
i don't know i'll probably get sucked in (26:47 - 26:51)
the same way i got sucked into pikmin (26:49 - 26:52)
bloom and now i'm the only one who plays (26:51 - 26:54)
it every day i play pikmin bloom every (26:52 - 26:57)
day well i'm 42. (26:54 - 26:59)
i i mean (26:57 - 27:01)
i don't i mean i'm looking at the (26:59 - 27:04)
artwork and i'm already saying right now (27:01 - 27:07)
they're not cute enough ah that's a (27:04 - 27:09)
that's important right there it kind of (27:07 - 27:10)
looks like they're supposed to be dogs (27:09 - 27:12)
like one of them is like digging a hole (27:10 - 27:14)
and it looks like they're kind of like a (27:12 - 27:15)
dog park (27:14 - 27:17)
yeah but he already has dogs i have no (27:15 - 27:19)
i'm just saying like that i think that (27:17 - 27:20)
feels like what they're going for for me (27:19 - 27:22)
it looks like one of them's they look (27:20 - 27:25)
like friends knock off eevees (27:22 - 27:27)
and not good design knockoff evs they (27:25 - 27:29)
have weird (27:27 - 27:31)
feathers in places that don't belong (27:29 - 27:34)
they have strange easter eggy weird (27:31 - 27:37)
bodies they're like half balloon half (27:34 - 27:39)
eevee no (27:37 - 27:41)
i'm out you need to make this thing (27:39 - 27:43)
cuter or (27:41 - 27:46)
allow me (27:43 - 27:46)
to design it (27:47 - 27:53)
in like a spore type making (27:50 - 27:56)
oh boy spore was a disaster where was (27:53 - 27:58)
the disaster because of capitalism it (27:56 - 28:00)
basically yes it was one of the greatest (27:58 - 28:03)
games of all time (28:00 - 28:04)
do you (28:03 - 28:06)
do you guys like the buddy feature in (28:04 - 28:09)
pogo do you interact with that (28:06 - 28:10)
oh no (28:09 - 28:13)
which feature the buddy feature i mean i (28:10 - 28:15)
i buddy (28:13 - 28:18)
i do my three easy things every day (28:15 - 28:20)
and then i'm out (28:18 - 28:22)
i only do the buddy when i'm required (28:20 - 28:23)
um (28:22 - 28:26)
i i just i i feel like um (28:23 - 28:28)
from my small sample size a lot of (28:26 - 28:31)
people don't use the buddy feature and i (28:28 - 28:33)
say that from like when i would stream (28:31 - 28:36)
pogo on twitch and people would watch me (28:33 - 28:38)
play the the the number one thing that (28:36 - 28:40)
people would type in chat was like how (28:38 - 28:42)
did you get your buddy to bounce back (28:40 - 28:45)
the pokeball to catch the pokemon (28:42 - 28:47)
and it's like (28:45 - 28:50)
that that feature has been in the game (28:47 - 28:52)
since buddies have been in which is what (28:50 - 28:53)
like three years now (28:52 - 28:56)
and you just have to get your buddy to (28:53 - 28:59)
the second heart (28:56 - 29:00)
like it's like the first thing you (28:59 - 29:03)
unlock which i think is (29:00 - 29:05)
uh what is that like 45 hearts or or (29:03 - 29:07)
something like that um (29:05 - 29:08)
it's like two it's like two or three (29:07 - 29:10)
days of like the max hearts that (29:08 - 29:13)
whatever that is added together um and (29:10 - 29:15)
that unlocks the second feature but it (29:13 - 29:16)
was just nonstop any time i streamed (29:15 - 29:18)
like i streamed pogo a lot last summer (29:16 - 29:20)
and then a little bit the summer before (29:18 - 29:21)
but it was like how did you get your (29:20 - 29:22)
buddy to do that how did you get the (29:21 - 29:24)
bounce back wait (29:22 - 29:25)
why why did your buddy show up and hit (29:24 - 29:27)
the pokemon it's like this is like the (29:25 - 29:29)
basic thing you unlock with the money (29:27 - 29:31)
feature it's like it just screams to me (29:29 - 29:33)
that you've like never you like you've (29:31 - 29:34)
never used the buddy feature at all (29:33 - 29:36)
you've never given or you have but you (29:34 - 29:38)
like you did it once and then never did (29:36 - 29:40)
it again i mean even i've unlocked that (29:38 - 29:42)
level and i really do not appreciate my (29:40 - 29:44)
buddies all right i'm already not into (29:42 - 29:46)
this game after reading this whole (29:44 - 29:47)
breeding system did you see the (29:46 - 29:49)
screenshots like that one of them looks (29:47 - 29:50)
cool (29:49 - 29:52)
okay but listen to this the creature (29:50 - 29:54)
will be ready to breathe once it reaches (29:52 - 29:56)
adulthood the goal is to diversify the (29:54 - 29:57)
species and the game is designed to (29:56 - 29:59)
motivate players to try to breed in (29:57 - 30:01)
order to produce new archetypes (29:59 - 30:03)
there are a plethora of options (30:01 - 30:06)
including unicorn peacock cheetah ram (30:03 - 30:08)
rabbit clownfish and a plethora of (30:06 - 30:09)
others (30:08 - 30:11)
adult peridots rated habitats which are (30:09 - 30:13)
points of interest in area where they (30:11 - 30:15)
live which is basically the gems to (30:13 - 30:17)
breed they must use nests which are (30:15 - 30:20)
forage materials found in habitats some (30:17 - 30:21)
nests have the ability to alter specific (30:20 - 30:24)
traits such as cheetah pattern nest (30:21 - 30:25)
resulting in a kid with a cheetah (30:24 - 30:27)
patterning some nests alter one trait (30:25 - 30:30)
while others mutate several and the (30:27 - 30:33)
rarity of each nest varies that right (30:30 - 30:38)
there the rarity of each nest varies i'm (30:33 - 30:41)
out what that sounds cool no (30:38 - 30:44)
because i already don't like the design (30:41 - 30:47)
so if i all i have is a bunch of clown (30:44 - 30:50)
fist nests and it's saying hey drive to (30:47 - 30:52)
iowa to found to find the good rare (30:50 - 30:54)
network no no it's not drive to iowa (30:52 - 30:55)
it's pay (30:54 - 30:58)
pay for the better nest radar so you can (30:55 - 31:01)
find the rarer nests (30:58 - 31:04)
why people wait (31:01 - 31:06)
show goes steve is so negative when it (31:04 - 31:08)
is clearly you you (31:06 - 31:10)
are the most negative person in the (31:08 - 31:12)
world (31:10 - 31:14)
this game looks cool i mean i don't know (31:12 - 31:16)
if like i thought wizards unite look (31:14 - 31:18)
cool i definitely tried to play it for a (31:16 - 31:21)
week it was very um it uh wizards unite (31:18 - 31:22)
asked a lot (31:21 - 31:25)
um this is already asking a lot and pic (31:22 - 31:28)
pikmin bloom doesn't ask you to do (31:25 - 31:29)
anything like pikmin bloom's just happy (31:28 - 31:31)
you installed (31:29 - 31:31)
game mostly every once in a while sends (31:31 - 31:32)
big the (31:31 - 31:32)
me a message like (31:34 - 31:36)
hi (31:35 - 31:37)
do you remember me and i'm like (31:36 - 31:39)
get back in the corner (31:37 - 31:41)
they're like okay (31:39 - 31:43)
let's see you on the one day you play (31:41 - 31:45)
which is the community community when (31:43 - 31:46)
somebody says hey if you open that (31:45 - 31:50)
recently oh yeah i should look (31:46 - 31:50)
i i think that i think this looks cool (31:50 - 31:55)
and i think it for me it's exciting (31:53 - 31:57)
because they have so many games under (31:55 - 32:00)
their belt now (31:57 - 32:02)
is this finally the good game or is this (32:00 - 32:04)
where they finally found the line to (32:02 - 32:06)
charge you the most money to get a rare (32:04 - 32:08)
nest so that you can have a unicorn i (32:06 - 32:10)
don't know what pikmin bloom is doing (32:08 - 32:12)
with their money like who (32:10 - 32:14)
well who's paying and pick what are you (32:12 - 32:16)
paying i know exactly well you need uh (32:14 - 32:18)
incubators (32:16 - 32:20)
yeah but like even so (32:18 - 32:22)
i have so many pikmin that i don't even (32:20 - 32:27)
care about why do i want to hatch more (32:22 - 32:27)
you would want to hatch more pikmin (32:28 - 32:31)
because of like you want to collect the (32:29 - 32:33)
different pikmin like i want all the (32:31 - 32:35)
cafe pigmen or i want to they're all (32:33 - 32:36)
dumb (32:35 - 32:38)
yeah they're cute they have a sticker (32:36 - 32:40)
that says m on their forehead oh why are (32:38 - 32:43)
those that cute those are the dumb ones (32:40 - 32:44)
yeah yeah that's correct and then the (32:43 - 32:46)
other one's weird so maybe sometimes (32:44 - 32:47)
it's a weird way (32:46 - 32:48)
i figured it out which is like (32:47 - 32:52)
who cares so you want when you when you (32:48 - 32:53)
when you're about to put a pikmin into (32:52 - 32:56)
the the planter you can see where they (32:53 - 32:58)
came from so it'll have like the cafe (32:56 - 33:00)
symbol or the movie symbol or the beach (32:58 - 33:02)
symbol so now i don't even tell my (33:00 - 33:04)
pikmin to pick up planters that are the (33:02 - 33:07)
um they look like a little park (33:04 - 33:08)
because the park ones are just going to (33:07 - 33:12)
be the m stickers or this is already (33:08 - 33:14)
already so much effort and parks you can (33:12 - 33:16)
your pikmin can put on a clover so (33:14 - 33:19)
you're wrong right there no the the park (33:16 - 33:22)
is the actual park park one is a bench (33:19 - 33:25)
if it's just like a tree (33:22 - 33:28)
that's like the generic one (33:25 - 33:30)
oh this is awful (33:28 - 33:33)
so like i i have almost finished my (33:30 - 33:36)
hamburger collection oh my god i walked (33:33 - 33:38)
into this conversation not caring and i (33:36 - 33:41)
am worse for it here greg i'll give you (33:38 - 33:44)
the will anderson efficient (33:41 - 33:45)
pikmin (33:44 - 33:47)
strategy for obtaining hawaii the thing (33:45 - 33:49)
that well number one that is not (33:47 - 33:51)
efficient because i still have ones from (33:49 - 33:54)
january that haven't made it back (33:51 - 33:55)
here yet (33:54 - 33:57)
here's the trick (33:55 - 33:59)
steve don't even try to argue (33:57 - 34:01)
number one (33:59 - 34:04)
when you check for your expeditions (34:01 - 34:05)
every day okay (34:04 - 34:08)
only pick up the big white ones don't (34:05 - 34:10)
pick up regular size you don't know i (34:08 - 34:12)
don't know those garbage regular sizes (34:10 - 34:14)
numbered well i do pick up the penguins (34:12 - 34:16)
because i like pink well that's foolish (34:14 - 34:17)
because those are things are a waste of (34:16 - 34:19)
time no you just have them before you (34:17 - 34:21)
get (34:19 - 34:23)
number two (34:21 - 34:24)
is (34:23 - 34:27)
once a pikmin gets a sticker on it (34:24 - 34:29)
send that pikmin away he's fulfilled his (34:27 - 34:30)
duty (34:29 - 34:32)
you've got that slot (34:30 - 34:34)
that you've gotten that type of pikmin (34:32 - 34:36)
throw it out you don't need it anymore (34:34 - 34:40)
no more pikmin management issues (34:36 - 34:40)
i guess i could see why you would spend (34:40 - 34:46)
coins on flowers because when you're (34:43 - 34:49)
planting the flowers you're getting more (34:46 - 34:51)
fruit which is getting you nectar which (34:49 - 34:54)
is getting you flowers (34:51 - 34:56)
but i feel like if you are actually (34:54 - 34:58)
playing the game (34:56 - 35:00)
which there's not a lot to play we've (34:58 - 35:02)
just discussed this (35:00 - 35:05)
i don't know who is buying the flowers (35:02 - 35:06)
right like (35:05 - 35:08)
i could see buying planters if you're (35:06 - 35:09)
like really trying to collect them all (35:08 - 35:11)
and you're like i got so many and i just (35:09 - 35:13)
want to keep hatching and stuff but like (35:11 - 35:15)
i feel like the things in the shop in (35:13 - 35:17)
pikmin (35:15 - 35:19)
aren't (35:17 - 35:21)
like i don't know who's like (35:19 - 35:22)
you're pl (35:21 - 35:24)
you have to play the game which is not a (35:22 - 35:27)
lot there and that loop is already (35:24 - 35:29)
pretty good so like (35:27 - 35:31)
i will say this i don't think it's (35:29 - 35:33)
possible to plant any more flowers at (35:31 - 35:34)
mall of america (35:33 - 35:36)
i opened that thing up the flowers (35:34 - 35:38)
expire it is just a (35:36 - 35:41)
sea of flowers every time yeah yeah mall (35:38 - 35:44)
america is insane for flowers but they (35:41 - 35:47)
expire they do expire i but never there (35:44 - 35:50)
ever because it's just all flowers it's (35:47 - 35:52)
flowers all the way down well look if i (35:50 - 35:54)
know i'm going like i i will turn (35:52 - 35:55)
flowers on when i'm like leaving the (35:54 - 35:57)
house (35:55 - 35:59)
because i otherwise i have too many (35:57 - 36:01)
flowers so i'll be like okay well i'm (35:59 - 36:02)
going to go to target then i'm going to (36:01 - 36:04)
home depot then i'm going to go panda (36:02 - 36:05)
express then i'm going to go to mall (36:04 - 36:07)
america then i'm going to come home (36:05 - 36:09)
and then i'm out of flowers and i'll be (36:07 - 36:10)
like you're empty finish planting i'm (36:09 - 36:13)
like cool well but next time i leave (36:10 - 36:14)
i'll have 300 again you ready for the (36:13 - 36:16)
will anderson efficient hack just plant (36:14 - 36:18)
flowers in your own house (36:16 - 36:20)
[Laughter] (36:18 - 36:22)
a planted flower is a planted flower it (36:20 - 36:24)
counts i will say this when it's warm (36:22 - 36:26)
again and i can walk outside i will (36:24 - 36:29)
probably turn the game back on again (36:26 - 36:31)
because i'm actually going on actual (36:29 - 36:32)
walks (36:31 - 36:34)
right now like walking around the mall (36:32 - 36:37)
of america in a circle (36:34 - 36:40)
no i no you don't get my attention and (36:37 - 36:42)
my gyms wi-fi is so bad (36:40 - 36:44)
that half the time everything yells at (36:42 - 36:46)
me like you don't have a connection so (36:44 - 36:48)
i'm not even trying (36:46 - 36:50)
i'm just walking around in a circle (36:48 - 36:51)
there too (36:50 - 36:54)
and uh back to the peridots i finally (36:51 - 36:56)
got them up on my screen here they are (36:54 - 36:58)
ugly as sin yeah (36:56 - 37:00)
did you see the zebra looking one in (36:58 - 37:01)
front of the giraffe that one's cool it (37:00 - 37:03)
looks like uh (37:01 - 37:06)
some sort of it looks like a monster are (37:03 - 37:07)
you guys looking at the screenshot that (37:06 - 37:10)
has like the 10 iphones yes yes yeah did (37:07 - 37:12)
you see those (37:10 - 37:14)
kind of disease i don't know what's (37:12 - 37:16)
wrong with the porsche the only one (37:14 - 37:18)
misery the only one that i think that (37:16 - 37:21)
looks semi-decent is (37:18 - 37:26)
a second from the right on the top row (37:21 - 37:28)
oh that looks like leafy on yeah one on (37:26 - 37:30)
the beach yeah the one on the beach yeah (37:28 - 37:32)
that one's cool i think the one on the (37:30 - 37:34)
chair is good (37:32 - 37:37)
no i don't i don't like things with cut (37:34 - 37:39)
i don't like color i don't want colorful (37:37 - 37:40)
things that's why you can get the black (37:39 - 37:42)
and white one in the bottom looks like (37:40 - 37:47)
it is ill and needs to be put down (37:42 - 37:47)
all right we gotta take a break here's (37:48 - 37:52)
the thing i will probably try it because (37:49 - 37:53)
you make me (37:52 - 37:55)
i never make you do anything i do make (37:53 - 37:57)
sure you get pigmented complain and (37:55 - 38:00)
complain and complain no you are excited (37:57 - 38:02)
how much fun (38:00 - 38:05)
and enjoyment and how happy i am and (38:02 - 38:06)
you're like i want to see the sound of (38:05 - 38:09)
times i've seen enjoyment on your face (38:06 - 38:12)
on one hand yeah (38:09 - 38:13)
the only reason pikmin is on my phone is (38:12 - 38:17)
because of that peer pressure yep (38:13 - 38:17)
we're taking a break when we come back (38:17 - 38:25)
we're talking about more stuff goodbye (38:20 - 38:25)
and we are back from our break wait (38:33 - 38:38)
we're all recording right yeah but we (38:36 - 38:40)
didn't stop (38:38 - 38:42)
i don't know um (38:40 - 38:44)
we got we got a little bit of news but i (38:42 - 38:45)
wanted to circle back to the peridot (38:44 - 38:48)
stuff the peridot stuff (38:45 - 38:49)
because they're not (38:48 - 38:51)
the thing that they s that they they (38:49 - 38:54)
highlighted in the like what is this (38:51 - 38:58)
game about is breeding (38:54 - 38:58)
and that is a i would argue (38:58 - 39:04)
a pretty big feature in pokemon games (39:01 - 39:06)
true (39:04 - 39:10)
and we have hatching eggs yep (39:06 - 39:13)
and we have evolving and we have trading (39:10 - 39:15)
and we have playing with the body and we (39:13 - 39:17)
have max happiness and we got evolving (39:15 - 39:20)
at night evolving during the day (39:17 - 39:23)
we got a lot of stuff from the games (39:20 - 39:25)
we don't got breathing (39:23 - 39:27)
we don't have z crystals either i would (39:25 - 39:31)
i would suspect z crystals are coming (39:27 - 39:31)
um (39:31 - 39:34)
so (39:32 - 39:34)
a lot of this would hang on what does (39:37 - 39:41)
breeding look like (39:38 - 39:44)
in pokemon go what does breeding look (39:41 - 39:47)
like in peridot (39:44 - 39:47)
does (39:50 - 39:53)
there's a part of me i i always think of (39:51 - 39:56)
like the big conspiracy stuff here oh (39:53 - 39:59)
god here we go there's a part of me that (39:56 - 40:01)
like (39:59 - 40:01)
thinks that niantic wants to do a bunch (40:01 - 40:05)
of stuff (40:03 - 40:06)
and (40:05 - 40:07)
they (40:06 - 40:09)
go to the pokemon company and they're (40:07 - 40:11)
like we want to do this and the pokemon (40:09 - 40:14)
company is like no (40:11 - 40:17)
so that's my big first conspiracy theory (40:14 - 40:19)
is that this this is a common thing that (40:17 - 40:21)
happens (40:19 - 40:23)
where niantic is like i want to do this (40:21 - 40:24)
they go to the pokemon company the (40:23 - 40:26)
pokemon company says no (40:24 - 40:29)
and i feel like what i said before the (40:26 - 40:32)
break with like what harry potter is (40:29 - 40:33)
doing what (40:32 - 40:35)
what harry potter nothing (40:33 - 40:36)
was doing (40:35 - 40:39)
they didn't say (40:36 - 40:40)
like one of the coolest things about (40:39 - 40:42)
harry potter and it wasn't even that (40:40 - 40:44)
cool probably for a casual player but (40:42 - 40:46)
for a hardcore player the you could do (40:44 - 40:48)
this on day one of harry potter you (40:46 - 40:49)
could go into the settings and you could (40:48 - 40:52)
download all the assets (40:49 - 40:55)
and it was like two gigs or whatever and (40:52 - 40:58)
it made the game run incredibly smooth (40:55 - 41:01)
because everything was just running off (40:58 - 41:02)
like you didn't have to preload that (41:01 - 41:04)
stuff from a server it was just on your (41:02 - 41:07)
phone unpackaged (41:04 - 41:09)
and another game that does that (41:07 - 41:11)
well this game will no longer exist (41:09 - 41:12)
probably by the end of the year was the (41:11 - 41:15)
pokemon trading card game online (41:12 - 41:17)
if you went into the settings (41:15 - 41:19)
uh there was a like like download all (41:17 - 41:21)
the card artwork and it was like five (41:19 - 41:23)
gigs or something (41:21 - 41:26)
and i could see why they they wouldn't (41:23 - 41:28)
want to force somebody to here's five (41:26 - 41:30)
gigs of pngs (41:28 - 41:31)
good luck (41:30 - 41:34)
but if you did do it your game rants (41:31 - 41:36)
much much smoother (41:34 - 41:38)
so it was always like really weird (41:36 - 41:40)
for the two years that harry potter was (41:38 - 41:42)
out that like pokemon go didn't have (41:40 - 41:44)
that feature of like just let me (41:42 - 41:46)
download these assets so what i'm (41:44 - 41:49)
hearing is games that let you download (41:46 - 41:51)
the assets (41:49 - 41:52)
go belly up (41:51 - 41:55)
true (41:52 - 41:55)
that's the common theme that's the (41:55 - 41:59)
common theme right there harry potter (41:57 - 42:00)
down the line says (41:59 - 42:02)
people stole those assets and never went (42:00 - 42:06)
back pokemon trading guard game online (42:02 - 42:08)
download the assets people like if i (42:06 - 42:11)
download them they're garbage i'm out (42:08 - 42:14)
i i i'm not saying that like (42:11 - 42:16)
niantic was like we found a way to do (42:14 - 42:18)
breeding in pokemon go presented it to (42:16 - 42:21)
the pokemon company they were like no (42:18 - 42:22)
and they were like well we're gonna make (42:21 - 42:24)
our own game (42:22 - 42:26)
i think they were i think they were (42:24 - 42:28)
always gonna make this game (42:26 - 42:29)
but (42:28 - 42:34)
well here's the thing i the i don't see (42:29 - 42:34)
on their bizarre mission statement how (42:35 - 42:39)
breeding (42:38 - 42:41)
in (42:39 - 42:44)
how breeding works in pokemon (42:41 - 42:46)
meets there you must walk (42:44 - 42:48)
because we said so mandate (42:46 - 42:50)
because (42:48 - 42:52)
they changed (42:50 - 42:54)
they changed gyms and stops into nests (42:52 - 42:56)
well they're already gems and stops here (42:54 - 42:57)
so (42:56 - 42:59)
if you just have two (42:57 - 43:01)
you breed them and you make your own (42:59 - 43:03)
eggs again that sort of goes against (43:01 - 43:06)
their whole concept of you have to go (43:03 - 43:08)
out to our things you have to go spin (43:06 - 43:10)
our stops you have to go send gifts to (43:08 - 43:14)
get our eggs like breeding stops (43:10 - 43:16)
a lot of how they think their games (43:14 - 43:19)
should be played i don't i don't (43:16 - 43:21)
necessarily think so because yeah if (43:19 - 43:22)
you're creative enough (43:21 - 43:25)
if if this is okay so in the main series (43:22 - 43:27)
pokemon game you you put two pokemon in (43:25 - 43:28)
a daycare (43:27 - 43:31)
whoa slow down this is a lot and then (43:28 - 43:32)
you have to like ride your bike in a (43:31 - 43:35)
circle to like get those to (43:32 - 43:36)
get an egg (43:35 - 43:39)
and i it was funny because i was i was i (43:36 - 43:41)
was unfortunately not really arguing i (43:39 - 43:43)
was like trying to educate somebody (43:41 - 43:44)
because (43:43 - 43:45)
i i did this like tweet about shiny (43:44 - 43:47)
pokemon and then somebody was like well (43:45 - 43:49)
they've never made it as easy as crystal (43:47 - 43:52)
which is one in 64 which is like (43:49 - 43:54)
well like i always wrote my because like (43:52 - 43:55)
one that's misinformation like yes it's (43:54 - 43:58)
one in 64. only if you have a shiny (43:55 - 44:01)
ditto right um otherwise there's a lot (43:58 - 44:05)
of caveats to that shiny odds also so (44:01 - 44:07)
for most people it's not you know it's (44:05 - 44:10)
one in 128 which is like the game gives (44:07 - 44:13)
you a shiny gyarados to set you up to do (44:10 - 44:15)
that but it's one in 128 which (44:13 - 44:17)
there are better shiny outs chain (44:15 - 44:19)
fishing is better than one in 128 (44:17 - 44:20)
dynamax adventure is better than one to (44:19 - 44:24)
128 um but even if you were like crystal (44:20 - 44:27)
is the easiest to breed because the odds (44:24 - 44:30)
are so low high i don't one in 64. (44:27 - 44:31)
whatever (44:30 - 44:34)
like that game (44:31 - 44:35)
is bad (44:34 - 44:38)
flips a coin to decide whether it gives (44:35 - 44:40)
you an egg or not so this is actually (44:38 - 44:42)
how it works when you're in goldenrod (44:40 - 44:43)
city and you put two pokemon in the (44:42 - 44:45)
daycare and you're like i want an egg in (44:43 - 44:47)
new pokemon games they just give you an (44:45 - 44:49)
egg after a certain amount of steps (44:47 - 44:51)
right like you walk 200 steps here's (44:49 - 44:53)
your roselli here's your roseli egg (44:51 - 44:55)
right you walk 500 steps here's your (44:53 - 44:58)
snorlax egg um in crystal (44:55 - 45:01)
you have to walk exactly 256 steps for (44:58 - 45:02)
any (45:01 - 45:04)
egg and then after the 256 steps the (45:02 - 45:07)
game flips a coin if heads the daycare (45:04 - 45:10)
man will give you an egg if tails no egg (45:07 - 45:13)
walk another 256 steps and so you can go (45:10 - 45:17)
20 or 30 minutes it's not exactly 50 it (45:13 - 45:19)
could be like 40 or 60 depending on like (45:17 - 45:21)
if they're the same pokemon you know if (45:19 - 45:23)
one came from a different game (45:21 - 45:25)
you could go 20 minutes without getting (45:23 - 45:27)
a single egg and guess what once you get (45:25 - 45:29)
that egg and crystal it takes like 10 (45:27 - 45:31)
minutes to hatch because like there's no (45:29 - 45:34)
flame body there's no like roto loto (45:31 - 45:36)
experience there's like nothing it just (45:34 - 45:39)
takes just (45:36 - 45:41)
so much um (45:39 - 45:46)
so i would i would assume that like (45:41 - 45:48)
there would be (45:46 - 45:51)
in pokemon go you would pick two pokemon (45:48 - 45:53)
and then you would have to walk (45:51 - 45:56)
to then get them to generate an egg that (45:53 - 45:58)
would be and then you would have to walk (45:56 - 46:00)
the egg that would be my process of what (45:58 - 46:03)
they would do that makes no money here's (46:00 - 46:04)
the secret correct (46:03 - 46:06)
that makes no money you (46:04 - 46:09)
have to defeat a gym (46:06 - 46:11)
and put your pokemon in that gym and (46:09 - 46:13)
then if there's a compatible pokemon in (46:11 - 46:14)
that gym either your own or somebody (46:13 - 46:15)
else's (46:14 - 46:17)
then when that pokemon comes back to you (46:15 - 46:20)
it may be carrying an egg (46:17 - 46:23)
here here's my hot take (46:20 - 46:24)
it's not really a hot take it's just a (46:23 - 46:26)
suggestion (46:24 - 46:28)
why this game has been out for six years (46:26 - 46:31)
we have poke stops we have gyms why do (46:28 - 46:33)
we not have like a third building a (46:31 - 46:36)
daycare like a daycare a pokemon center (46:33 - 46:37)
a (46:36 - 46:40)
mart or something why if if niantic (46:37 - 46:42)
wants us to leave (46:40 - 46:44)
the house (46:42 - 46:46)
and you can access gyms from remote (46:44 - 46:48)
raids and you know pokestops aren't (46:46 - 46:49)
really that great unless you need tasks (46:48 - 46:51)
but you can kind of get one task a day (46:49 - 46:53)
why is there not another place to let me (46:51 - 46:54)
visit (46:53 - 46:57)
again this is a harry potter thing (46:54 - 46:58)
it had like (46:57 - 46:59)
four different buildings did it not it (46:58 - 47:02)
had like green houses it had yeah towers (46:59 - 47:05)
it had i think schools (47:02 - 47:07)
it had ten i don't know (47:05 - 47:08)
one of them was greenhouses i know that (47:07 - 47:09)
for sure (47:08 - 47:11)
look (47:09 - 47:13)
in six years we've learned that they do (47:11 - 47:15)
the least effort as possible (47:13 - 47:16)
so (47:15 - 47:18)
designing another stop and then (47:16 - 47:21)
converting somebody's gym into a daycare (47:18 - 47:23)
is gonna cause problems now i could see (47:21 - 47:27)
them i could see them doing (47:23 - 47:29)
a daycare system but i can't see them (47:27 - 47:32)
not charging you money to leave (47:29 - 47:34)
two eggs in there that they have to then (47:32 - 47:36)
come back and (47:34 - 47:37)
collect an egg from (47:36 - 47:39)
and (47:37 - 47:40)
well you're still gonna have to pay for (47:39 - 47:42)
the incubator to hatch your egg yeah (47:40 - 47:44)
right that's not going anywhere but at (47:42 - 47:47)
what point (47:44 - 47:47)
i guess that point is now (47:47 - 47:50)
if you've been playing this game since (47:49 - 47:52)
day one (47:50 - 47:53)
you have (47:52 - 47:56)
most if not all of the pokemon granted (47:53 - 47:57)
you might not have (47:56 - 48:01)
you know comfey you might not have uh (47:57 - 48:03)
tropius (48:01 - 48:05)
because it was a regional exclusive (48:03 - 48:07)
but (48:05 - 48:09)
like uh (48:07 - 48:10)
before we started (48:09 - 48:12)
before we started recording i opened up (48:10 - 48:15)
the game it was two tangola two paris (48:12 - 48:17)
uh a banari (48:15 - 48:19)
and i don't remember the last one was (48:17 - 48:20)
like a (48:19 - 48:23)
norikorio or something right like (48:20 - 48:24)
like (48:23 - 48:26)
nothing great i need to see if i have a (48:24 - 48:29)
fire type hold on (48:26 - 48:31)
and (48:29 - 48:31)
if i put two (48:34 - 48:40)
mud kips in a daycare in pogo because i (48:36 - 48:43)
want a specific mud kip for go battle (48:40 - 48:45)
league (48:43 - 48:47)
i can't like right now i'm never gonna (48:45 - 48:49)
see a mudkip right like commune day is (48:47 - 48:51)
over i am never going to see a mudkip in (48:49 - 48:54)
the wild i could maybe trade for mudkips (48:51 - 48:58)
but if i was like hey niantic i really (48:54 - 49:00)
want to participate in go battle league (48:58 - 49:02)
i missed out on on community day because (49:00 - 49:05)
you screwed me over (49:02 - 49:07)
it was only three hours it wasn't six (49:05 - 49:09)
hours i couldn't play i want to play (49:07 - 49:11)
your game i want to participate and go (49:09 - 49:13)
battle league swampert's supposed to be (49:11 - 49:15)
good i don't have anyone to trade with (49:13 - 49:17)
but if you're going to tell me i can go (49:15 - 49:19)
down to the downtown area of my city (49:17 - 49:22)
where there would be a breeder (49:19 - 49:25)
and i can put two of my bad mudkips in (49:22 - 49:28)
and wait 48 hours and get a mudkip egg (49:25 - 49:31)
and then walk to hatch that mudkip egg (49:28 - 49:33)
isn't that everything that niantic wants (49:31 - 49:34)
they want you to leave your house they (49:33 - 49:36)
want you to go somewhere they want you (49:34 - 49:37)
to come back they want you to then walk (49:36 - 49:39)
the egg (49:37 - 49:41)
i mean no because they also want the (49:39 - 49:43)
community days to be special they want (49:41 - 49:46)
to release things on their schedule they (49:43 - 49:48)
want to (49:46 - 49:49)
they want to make sure that there is (49:48 - 49:52)
false scarcity so that when a community (49:49 - 49:54)
comes around and you've been waiting two (49:52 - 49:55)
years to get a mud fit or go battle (49:54 - 49:58)
league you go to make sure you make that (49:55 - 50:01)
you make that community today like (49:58 - 50:03)
from the like you have to take what's (50:01 - 50:06)
easy for the player out of this equation (50:03 - 50:08)
and think (50:06 - 50:10)
what are what are their goals and what (50:08 - 50:11)
are they trying to push and they're (50:10 - 50:14)
trying to make their events special to (50:11 - 50:16)
make sure that you (50:14 - 50:18)
go out when they want you to go out and (50:16 - 50:20)
they want you to hit the places that you (50:18 - 50:23)
want now could i see them (50:20 - 50:25)
saying like hey (50:23 - 50:27)
as a sponsorship deal starbucks or (50:25 - 50:29)
whoever wants to sponsor will turn your (50:27 - 50:31)
thing into a daycare (50:29 - 50:33)
and people will come (50:31 - 50:35)
and leave stuff there and it'll be a a (50:33 - 50:37)
stopping spot i could see them doing (50:35 - 50:40)
that but i do think things like making (50:37 - 50:42)
your own pokemon or making things on (50:40 - 50:44)
your own (50:42 - 50:46)
goes against one of their unstated (50:44 - 50:48)
things is that we want our events to be (50:46 - 50:51)
special and we want to control (50:48 - 50:53)
how you gain access to the good (50:51 - 50:56)
the to the good are we saying niantic (50:53 - 50:57)
wants that or are we saying the pokemon (50:56 - 51:00)
company wants that because when i read (50:57 - 51:03)
the peridot release and they they use (51:00 - 51:06)
the word breeding and i feel like (51:03 - 51:08)
i feel like that's not it like i feel (51:06 - 51:10)
like that they were like make sure we (51:08 - 51:12)
include the word breeding because (51:10 - 51:14)
there's no way in the six years of pogo (51:12 - 51:16)
they have not sat there and talked about (51:14 - 51:18)
how will breeding work in pokemon go (51:16 - 51:19)
whether it comes out this year whether (51:18 - 51:20)
it comes out next year whether it comes (51:19 - 51:22)
out in 10 years there is not a there's (51:20 - 51:24)
not a doubt in my mind that that team at (51:22 - 51:27)
niantic didn't discuss the possibilities (51:24 - 51:31)
of what reading looks like in pogo (51:27 - 51:33)
and if they've figured it out and they (51:31 - 51:34)
pitched it to the pokemon company and (51:33 - 51:37)
the pokemon company was like no (51:34 - 51:38)
and they were like (51:37 - 51:40)
well our new game's coming out we're (51:38 - 51:42)
gonna do it there and then we're gonna (51:40 - 51:44)
show that everyone likes it here we're (51:42 - 51:46)
gonna show more importantly (51:44 - 51:48)
that this breeding thing we're putting (51:46 - 51:50)
in peridot is gonna make money and then (51:48 - 51:52)
they can go back to the pokemon company (51:50 - 51:53)
and they could go look it we did (51:52 - 51:56)
breeding right it makes money people (51:53 - 51:59)
love it let us do it in pogo that's why (51:56 - 52:01)
i don't i don't think they i don't think (51:59 - 52:03)
they pitched it (52:01 - 52:03)
to (52:03 - 52:05)
pokemon company first and pokemon said (52:03 - 52:07)
no i mean it is very common especially (52:05 - 52:09)
in a lot of companies where you go to a (52:07 - 52:12)
different project prove that it can work (52:09 - 52:13)
and then you can bring that (52:12 - 52:15)
to the big thing and say (52:13 - 52:18)
here's our absolute proof of concept (52:15 - 52:19)
yeah (52:18 - 52:21)
let's do it like (52:19 - 52:25)
i i don't i don't think that they (52:21 - 52:27)
i i don't think pokemon companies said (52:25 - 52:28)
no i don't i like i don't think they're (52:27 - 52:30)
like we really want breeding and the (52:28 - 52:32)
company said no an important part of our (52:30 - 52:34)
games you can't have (52:32 - 52:36)
i think that took them a while to figure (52:34 - 52:38)
out how they would monetize it and then (52:36 - 52:40)
they have to show that it works and then (52:38 - 52:42)
they have to convince them to say well (52:40 - 52:44)
the nesting thing works so let us change (52:42 - 52:47)
stops into something different (52:44 - 52:49)
because it's going to take a change to (52:47 - 52:51)
how the game plays and they need to have (52:49 - 52:54)
that proof of concept first (52:51 - 52:54)
yeah i just i also just think that the (52:54 - 52:58)
game has to have a new feature (52:56 - 53:00)
eventually right when was our last new (52:58 - 53:03)
feature was mega (53:00 - 53:03)
i lost track (53:04 - 53:08)
like when they introduced raids that was (53:05 - 53:10)
actually like huge right yeah it was (53:08 - 53:12)
like we could like i remember the day (53:10 - 53:14)
raids came out and i remember raiding a (53:12 - 53:18)
uh crocodile a bay leaf and the other (53:14 - 53:21)
one that everyone forgets (53:18 - 53:21)
well lava the best one excuse me like i (53:21 - 53:26)
remember going out and seeing raids and (53:24 - 53:28)
seeing the countdown and being like this (53:26 - 53:29)
is cool (53:28 - 53:31)
and then the buddy feature was another (53:29 - 53:33)
thing they added right so buddy feature (53:31 - 53:34)
raids (53:33 - 53:37)
um gosh i'm forgetting so many like (53:34 - 53:38)
features there like i guess you could (53:37 - 53:42)
say the postcard post book like i mean (53:38 - 53:44)
eggs weren't there from the beginning (53:42 - 53:45)
no eggs weren't there from the beginning (53:44 - 53:46)
no eggs were there from the beginning (53:45 - 53:48)
were they yeah yeah eggs were there from (53:46 - 53:50)
the beginning (53:48 - 53:52)
yes because that was one of the ways to (53:50 - 53:54)
get a dratini was 10k egg (53:52 - 53:56)
um and the magic carps were littered in (53:54 - 53:59)
2k and i think the starters were in 5k (53:56 - 54:00)
and eevee was definitely in 5k because (53:59 - 54:02)
it was non-stop eevees and 5k (54:00 - 54:05)
um remember (54:02 - 54:07)
lucky pokemon yeah i don't think was (54:05 - 54:09)
like a huge i'm like talking huge (54:07 - 54:11)
features like raids (54:09 - 54:14)
um mega pokemon (54:11 - 54:14)
the i would assume that um (54:15 - 54:22)
z go battling or battling in general (54:18 - 54:23)
like battling should have been there (54:22 - 54:25)
from the start trading should have been (54:23 - 54:26)
there from the start there like when (54:25 - 54:28)
pogo launched obviously it was complete (54:26 - 54:29)
disaster there was no trading there was (54:28 - 54:31)
no battling that definitely (54:29 - 54:33)
that definitely turned away a lot of (54:31 - 54:35)
people and i remember talking to people (54:33 - 54:36)
that were like oh my gosh i love the (54:35 - 54:38)
first summer of pogo i would have kept (54:36 - 54:40)
playing if there was battling love the (54:38 - 54:41)
first summer pogo i would have kept (54:40 - 54:45)
playing if there was trading like (54:41 - 54:45)
i i don't know whether you hate it or (54:46 - 54:49)
love it (54:48 - 54:51)
trading battling these kind of feet (54:49 - 54:53)
breeding in my opinion these are (54:51 - 54:56)
features that like (54:53 - 54:56)
are core features that (54:58 - 55:02)
casual people care about (55:00 - 55:04)
the hardcore people will care about like (55:02 - 55:07)
the deep analytics of go battle league (55:04 - 55:11)
or ivs or shinees or shundos or (55:07 - 55:14)
schluckies whatever silly names they've (55:11 - 55:16)
come up with but i think for like a (55:14 - 55:18)
casual person (55:16 - 55:19)
can i trade every once in a while can i (55:18 - 55:21)
battle every once in a while can i raid (55:19 - 55:23)
every once in a while can i breed every (55:21 - 55:26)
once in a while i think (55:23 - 55:29)
the lack of a huge (55:26 - 55:31)
feature (55:29 - 55:35)
with how old this game is (55:31 - 55:37)
um (55:35 - 55:37)
i feel like breeding is one of those (55:38 - 55:41)
features that they eventually have to (55:40 - 55:43)
roll out (55:41 - 55:44)
not sooner rather than later but like (55:43 - 55:46)
there's no way they haven't had that (55:44 - 55:47)
conversation there's no way they're like (55:46 - 55:49)
how when is it when are we gonna do this (55:47 - 55:51)
how's it gonna look (55:49 - 55:52)
maybe we'll try it in this game first (55:51 - 55:54)
and then bring it to pogo (55:52 - 55:56)
yeah i mean i also think that they were (55:54 - 55:59)
big on introducing (55:56 - 56:01)
baby forms as part of their special (55:59 - 56:04)
releases yeah and now we're out we're (56:01 - 56:06)
like out of babies at this point like (56:04 - 56:08)
eggs weren't added until october 25th (56:06 - 56:11)
2016. so they came out after the game (56:08 - 56:13)
started (56:11 - 56:13)
if i'm reading this correctly yeah (56:13 - 56:18)
man that's that first year of pogo (56:16 - 56:20)
really yeah it was a wild year (56:18 - 56:22)
i mean the game didn't really work for (56:20 - 56:24)
the first three months so it does make (56:22 - 56:27)
it makes sense um i i (56:24 - 56:28)
the way they like to (56:27 - 56:32)
the way they like to make pokemon (56:28 - 56:35)
exclusive i i think (56:32 - 56:37)
i just don't think we're gonna see (56:35 - 56:39)
breeding in this game until they get (56:37 - 56:40)
past (56:39 - 56:43)
holding back babies and holding back (56:40 - 56:46)
other types uh as exclusive reasons to (56:43 - 56:48)
get people to come but you can you can (56:46 - 56:49)
still hold that stuff back right like (56:48 - 56:53)
much likes you need um (56:49 - 56:53)
or something right (56:53 - 56:56)
like at this point who cares if you're (56:55 - 57:00)
hatching peaches or iggly buffs like (56:56 - 57:01)
they're everywhere you could maybe make (57:00 - 57:03)
the argument for like oh well relicanth (57:01 - 57:05)
is so rare what if somebody went to new (57:03 - 57:07)
zealand and then came back and then (57:05 - 57:09)
started breeding relic ants and it's (57:07 - 57:10)
like what is the difference between (57:09 - 57:11)
somebody (57:10 - 57:13)
getting a relic camp every two days (57:11 - 57:15)
let's just say breeding takes (57:13 - 57:17)
48 hours what's the difference of one (57:15 - 57:18)
person getting a roller can every two (57:17 - 57:21)
days and then somebody going to the 2019 (57:18 - 57:23)
world championships catching 50 (57:21 - 57:25)
relicanth and then coming back to (57:23 - 57:26)
milwaukee and being like who wants a (57:25 - 57:28)
relic camp (57:26 - 57:30)
no one does (57:28 - 57:31)
to be honest i didn't have any friends (57:30 - 57:33)
to trade with but if i did i would have (57:31 - 57:35)
only traded like two of them like plus (57:33 - 57:36)
all the incubators they would have had (57:35 - 57:38)
to pay for to hatch those relicanth eggs (57:36 - 57:41)
to actually get the relic ants yeah (57:38 - 57:42)
that's money (57:41 - 57:45)
i think i think there's big bad i think (57:42 - 57:47)
there's big money in breeding i mean (57:45 - 57:50)
there already is with the random slot (57:47 - 57:53)
that you that you have right (57:50 - 57:56)
like you don't know which which piece of (57:53 - 57:58)
garbage you can get in your 2k egg but (57:56 - 58:00)
chances are the one that you want isn't (57:58 - 58:02)
going to show up i mean there may be (58:00 - 58:03)
money off that way you already can't (58:02 - 58:06)
breed legendaries right yeah (58:03 - 58:08)
you know what all right just like there (58:06 - 58:10)
is there is (58:08 - 58:12)
i mean i could go at like about how (58:10 - 58:15)
false scarcity drives these games (58:12 - 58:16)
because literally there's no reason to (58:15 - 58:18)
stop them other than they want that (58:16 - 58:21)
feeling of false scarcity and rarity to (58:18 - 58:24)
be a thing like is programmed code they (58:21 - 58:25)
could change it at a moment and have (58:24 - 58:27)
shown time and time they can it's called (58:25 - 58:30)
community day (58:27 - 58:30)
they could introduce breeding with (58:31 - 58:35)
manafee (58:32 - 58:38)
oh they could and then fiona i (58:35 - 58:40)
breeding aside i still think there (58:38 - 58:42)
should be a another place to visit (58:40 - 58:44)
like i i actually like the more i (58:42 - 58:45)
thought about that this week and like (58:44 - 58:47)
the peridot stuff i was like why is it (58:45 - 58:50)
just gyms and stops when harry potter (58:47 - 58:52)
was doing a bunch of stuff yeah but what (58:50 - 58:54)
was it what was each of the stuff doing (58:52 - 58:55)
and that i can't remember i don't (58:54 - 58:58)
remember because no i cared (58:55 - 59:00)
i should download ingress and just let's (58:58 - 59:01)
see what's happening in grace but i (59:00 - 59:02)
thought ingress was actually really (59:01 - 59:03)
simple too (59:02 - 59:06)
and then in in in pikmin it's just (59:03 - 59:10)
big flowers and then flowers you walk (59:06 - 59:12)
if you plan i think it's p in pikmin if (59:10 - 59:13)
you plant (59:12 - 59:16)
200 flowers buy a big flower that flower (59:13 - 59:17)
will then (59:16 - 59:20)
bloom um and then you can get the i (59:17 - 59:21)
don't think there's anything else in (59:20 - 59:23)
pikmin besides that right it's just the (59:21 - 59:25)
big flowers (59:23 - 59:27)
for oh yeah for locations (59:25 - 59:29)
yeah there's mushrooms oh there's the (59:27 - 59:31)
mushrooms which randomly generate in and (59:29 - 59:33)
out yeah so they're pikmin has two as (59:31 - 59:35)
well (59:33 - 59:35)
yeah i'm looking this up i'm trying to (59:39 - 59:45)
find a good harry potter (59:41 - 59:45)
for a dead game to tell me what that (59:46 - 59:52)
what that was and why there were so many (59:49 - 59:54)
this is difficult because the first page (59:52 - 59:56)
of google is literally it's closing (59:54 - 60:02)
yeah that makes sense like okay i am (59:56 - 60:02)
it's it's (60:03 - 60:07)
it's clear it's not clear it's obvious (60:04 - 60:08)
that like (60:07 - 60:10)
pokemon go isn't ending anytime soon (60:08 - 60:12)
they want this to be a 10 15 20 year (60:10 - 60:14)
game so (60:12 - 60:17)
ins gave you spell energy (60:14 - 60:19)
okay give me give me the locations greg (60:17 - 60:22)
location us okay ends (60:19 - 60:24)
got spell energy (60:22 - 60:25)
got it (60:24 - 60:28)
green houses provide potion ingredients (60:25 - 60:29)
for brewing (60:28 - 60:32)
fortresses you can battle creatures (60:29 - 60:34)
yep i remember this (60:32 - 60:36)
that's it oh there's three there's three (60:34 - 60:39)
according to this (60:36 - 60:39)
um i thought there was a fourth one i (60:39 - 60:43)
think fortresses could upgrade i think (60:41 - 60:45)
it's like they're bigger this guide (60:43 - 60:50)
granted this is from 2019 so who knows (60:45 - 60:52)
it's what i could find okay it says (60:50 - 60:53)
there are three main types of buildings (60:52 - 60:57)
ins greenhouses and fortresses (60:53 - 60:58)
i'm looking to see there's things you (60:57 - 61:00)
could find there are port keys that let (60:58 - 61:01)
you (61:00 - 61:05)
do to other things but no (61:01 - 61:05)
yeah and again the problem with adding (61:05 - 61:09)
like a third location (61:07 - 61:12)
is you know if you don't live in a city (61:09 - 61:13)
you're going to be like oh i don't have (61:12 - 61:15)
a nursery i don't have a pokemon center (61:13 - 61:17)
i don't have a pokemart i only have one (61:15 - 61:18)
stop (61:17 - 61:20)
i don't even have a gym (61:18 - 61:20)
look (61:20 - 61:22)
yeah that's yeah (61:20 - 61:25)
pokemon is their store in game everybody (61:22 - 61:27)
can get to the pokemart that's true they (61:25 - 61:28)
don't want you they want to make sure (61:27 - 61:31)
you can access and spend money (61:28 - 61:33)
the mark will never be a location you (61:31 - 61:35)
can always give them money (61:33 - 61:39)
there's also still be like (61:35 - 61:41)
when are we getting when are we getting (61:39 - 61:43)
a a a season when are we getting a (61:41 - 61:45)
monthly pass like that that has to be (61:43 - 61:47)
something (61:45 - 61:49)
why does that say has to it doesn't have (61:47 - 61:52)
to there must be making just enough (61:49 - 61:54)
money right now that they don't have to (61:52 - 61:55)
worry about that (61:54 - 61:58)
i i think they always want to make more (61:55 - 61:59)
money i think there was something in the (61:58 - 62:02)
game code a while back of like oh it (61:59 - 62:04)
looks like they're implementing (62:02 - 62:06)
framework for like a season pass or a (62:04 - 62:09)
subscription subscription model yeah (62:06 - 62:12)
um (62:09 - 62:13)
before we go to our last little bits of (62:12 - 62:16)
news uh there was another (62:13 - 62:18)
data mine (62:16 - 62:19)
um because pogo just got updated (62:18 - 62:22)
recently that referenced pokemon sleep (62:19 - 62:23)
again (62:22 - 62:25)
uh i have said this on my twitch streams (62:23 - 62:25)
i don't think we said this on the (62:25 - 62:28)
podcast there's always like uh the the (62:25 - 62:30)
chatter there's always another sleep (62:28 - 62:33)
the pokemon sleep is dead (62:30 - 62:36)
um the reason we know that pokemon sleep (62:33 - 62:40)
is not dead is because in late january (62:36 - 62:43)
there was a an update in regards to (62:40 - 62:46)
sleep in pogo specifically for what was (62:43 - 62:48)
called the go plus plus that little (62:46 - 62:50)
hockey shaped puck (62:48 - 62:52)
um (62:50 - 62:54)
so there was an update in pogo of their (62:52 - 62:55)
base framework (62:54 - 62:59)
for pogo to work with the go plus plus (62:55 - 63:01)
and there was (62:59 - 63:04)
basic compatibility between sleep and (63:01 - 63:05)
between pogo we still don't know what (63:04 - 63:07)
that looks like we don't know what sleep (63:05 - 63:08)
is supposed to do (63:07 - 63:10)
we know what the title screen of sleep (63:08 - 63:12)
looks like and we know what the go plus (63:10 - 63:14)
plus looks like (63:12 - 63:18)
uh and then in the recent i don't (63:14 - 63:21)
0.25372 whatever the last update was for (63:18 - 63:23)
pogo there was another line of code (63:21 - 63:26)
in regards to the go plus plus (63:23 - 63:28)
um (63:26 - 63:31)
so hopefully that comes out this year uh (63:28 - 63:32)
mostly i don't really care about pokemon (63:31 - 63:34)
sleep like everyone else i just want the (63:32 - 63:36)
goplus plus i just want another i just (63:34 - 63:38)
want another device that like auto (63:36 - 63:41)
catches pokemon i like the i like the (63:38 - 63:43)
pokeball plus it's just (63:41 - 63:45)
you know it's a little big something a (63:43 - 63:48)
little flatter might be nice so you can (63:45 - 63:49)
hold it against the back of your phone (63:48 - 63:51)
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah (63:49 - 63:53)
so yeah and then i can hold you weren't (63:51 - 63:55)
at community will when i was like trying (63:53 - 63:57)
to hold my dq (63:55 - 64:00)
uh smoothie and then try to hold my (63:57 - 64:02)
phone and then try to like go plus plus (64:00 - 64:03)
and then i gotta brain freeze cause i (64:02 - 64:04)
was trying to drink the smoothie too (64:03 - 64:06)
fast and that was the punishment for (64:04 - 64:08)
forgetting (64:06 - 64:10)
for flying too close to the sun and (64:08 - 64:13)
doing too many things trying trying to (64:10 - 64:16)
have so much fun so fast so fast you (64:13 - 64:18)
brain froze and then we went into the (64:16 - 64:20)
levi's store and then they were charging (64:18 - 64:22)
70 for a hoodie and i was like oh i (64:20 - 64:24)
can't afford that (64:22 - 64:26)
i still i (64:24 - 64:29)
if that if that yellow jeans jackety (64:26 - 64:30)
thing wasn't so expensive i probably (64:29 - 64:32)
would have bought it it was like 100 (64:30 - 64:33)
bucks it was like a hundred bucks you (64:32 - 64:36)
gotta get the japanese denim jean jacket (64:33 - 64:39)
like i have but is it yellow (64:36 - 64:42)

what is the the newest set is um you can (71:46 - 71:51)
pre-order it off pokemon center right (71:49 - 71:52)
now i can't remember what it's called i (71:51 - 71:54)
have a bone to pick with the tcg (71:52 - 71:55)
community (71:54 - 71:56)
oh boy (71:55 - 72:00)
yeah they're nothing but problems i (71:56 - 72:03)
put out a simple call (72:00 - 72:04)
i would (72:03 - 72:07)
i would happily (72:04 - 72:11)
play the pokemon card game okay somebody (72:07 - 72:13)
in the tcg community would just create (72:11 - 72:16)
me a deck that had rosalia in it (72:13 - 72:18)
how it works that's not and you know (72:16 - 72:22)
what they're all like you can't (72:18 - 72:25)
yeah or play this play this bizarre (72:22 - 72:28)
fan made (72:25 - 72:28)
set (72:28 - 72:31)
no i could i could i could build you a (72:29 - 72:32)
result i gotta look at the card list but (72:31 - 72:34)
i can do it (72:32 - 72:37)
a rosella a deck that would work no (72:34 - 72:38)
there's no such thing (72:37 - 72:40)
it doesn't have to work look you've seen (72:38 - 72:42)
me play commander i play bad decks i (72:40 - 72:44)
haven't played that bad candidate no no (72:42 - 72:46)
i mean kevin k was like a real deck it (72:44 - 72:47)
was like a budget deck but like canada (72:46 - 72:49)
is cool there is there's there's there's (72:47 - 72:53)
a big difference between pokemon tcg and (72:49 - 72:57)
magic let me hear it magic number one (72:53 - 72:59)
has a huge cardboard (72:57 - 73:02)
enormous card pool (72:59 - 73:03)
so (73:02 - 73:05)
you're gonna find cards that have some (73:03 - 73:07)
amount of synergy (73:05 - 73:09)
around throughout the history of blah (73:07 - 73:10)
blah blah (73:09 - 73:12)
pokemon (73:10 - 73:14)
number one doesn't have the huge card (73:12 - 73:16)
pool that magic does (73:14 - 73:19)
first off but second off they are very (73:16 - 73:23)
very specific in when they design cards (73:19 - 73:25)
they're not designed to be versatile (73:23 - 73:28)
they're designed to support a very (73:25 - 73:31)
specific mechanic of this is what your (73:28 - 73:32)
deck is going to accomplish (73:31 - 73:36)
they know when they design those cards (73:32 - 73:39)
maybe like to 97 like three percent they (73:36 - 73:41)
make a mistake and publish a card that (73:39 - 73:43)
shouldn't have been published they know (73:41 - 73:44)
which cards (73:43 - 73:46)
should be put together in that 60 card (73:44 - 73:48)
deck to be the optimal build for that (73:46 - 73:52)
deck and it's never rosalia (73:48 - 73:53)
never (73:52 - 73:57)
rosalia exists as pac filler for people (73:53 - 73:59)
who are collecting (73:57 - 74:02)
just saying there's a syrian liligan (73:59 - 74:04)
card that's coming up and it's a grass (74:02 - 74:05)
deck and there (74:04 - 74:08)
the fact that you can't that the tcg (74:05 - 74:09)
people want me to play their game but (74:08 - 74:11)
they can't (74:09 - 74:14)
even design a bad non-synergy deck for (74:11 - 74:16)
me (74:14 - 74:17)
this is the bone i have to pick with (74:16 - 74:19)
this with these people okay i could make (74:17 - 74:22)
you a bad commander deck and you'd still (74:19 - 74:24)
have a good time playing it (74:22 - 74:26)
okay so (74:24 - 74:30)
will is correct and a a good point of (74:26 - 74:32)
this is this hissuian zoroark v star (74:30 - 74:34)
they showed off (74:32 - 74:36)
its move is too colorless (74:34 - 74:37)
i don't remember what it's called but i (74:36 - 74:39)
can explain what it does (74:37 - 74:43)
it does 50 damage for every pokemon you (74:39 - 74:46)
have in play with a damage counter on it (74:43 - 74:48)
and there's a stadium card (74:46 - 74:50)
um which i think either is already out (74:48 - 74:53)
or is coming out that when a pokemon (74:50 - 74:55)
goes into play from your hand to your (74:53 - 74:58)
bench you or your opponent (74:55 - 75:01)
they have to take one damage counter so (74:58 - 75:03)
they do design these cards they do (75:01 - 75:05)
design certain cards to be very good (75:03 - 75:08)
and to be competitive so will is 100 (75:05 - 75:08)
correct (75:08 - 75:11)
and and certain pokemon are always good (75:08 - 75:14)
as it turns out zoroark is almost always (75:11 - 75:16)
a good card like the last time i played (75:14 - 75:20)
the tcg zoroark was one of the most (75:16 - 75:21)
dominant cards and that wasn't that long (75:20 - 75:23)
ago that was like three or four years it (75:21 - 75:25)
was like three years ago um where like (75:23 - 75:27)
zoroark's ability lets you like discard (75:25 - 75:29)
one card and let you draw two that on (75:27 - 75:31)
itself was like amazing and then it's (75:29 - 75:32)
its move was like a double colorless and (75:31 - 75:34)
its move was actually really good too um (75:32 - 75:40)
so like zoroark darkrai mew um (75:34 - 75:42)
gardevoir for the most part smeargle (75:40 - 75:45)
like there are always pokemon in the tcg (75:42 - 75:47)
charizard is always almost always bad (75:45 - 75:50)
is popular so uh but like restaurants (75:47 - 75:52)
that crom those are almost always good (75:50 - 75:54)
so like there's no surprise here that (75:52 - 75:56)
the zoroark they showed on the cover of (75:54 - 75:58)
the set it was like oh my gosh the zorro (75:56 - 76:00)
card is actually going to like be able (75:58 - 76:03)
to be competitive (76:00 - 76:03)
you can get (76:03 - 76:07)
pokemon (76:05 - 76:07)
like (76:07 - 76:10)
rosalia or like your favorites to work (76:07 - 76:14)
in a deck it will probably be clunky (76:10 - 76:15)
um (76:14 - 76:17)
and you will probably need a strong (76:15 - 76:20)
pokemon to support that deck (76:17 - 76:22)
uh so it it could be like zoroark for (76:20 - 76:24)
example (76:22 - 76:26)
but if you were to play like a zoroac (76:24 - 76:28)
razalia deck would it be the best deck (76:26 - 76:30)
in the world no would you be able to (76:28 - 76:31)
like make it less clunky with like draw (76:30 - 76:33)
support and stuff yes (76:31 - 76:36)
uh would you win (76:33 - 76:38)
in a tournament no would you have fun (76:36 - 76:41)
with local and friends yes you would no (76:38 - 76:45)
i disagree because what you would have (76:41 - 76:48)
is you would have a disabled zoroark (76:45 - 76:50)
deck because you'd have to take out some (76:48 - 76:53)
pieces that were making that zoro (76:50 - 76:56)
zoroark deck work to fit in (76:53 - 76:58)
does is the (76:56 - 76:59)
what was the thing that lets you skip (76:58 - 77:02)
second stages (76:59 - 77:02)
is rare candy still available no right (77:02 - 77:07)
rare candy yeah i think it is i don't (77:05 - 77:09)
think they rotated real candy though (77:07 - 77:11)
well okay but still i need (77:09 - 77:13)
for badu (77:11 - 77:17)
for roselia or do you know i just like (77:13 - 77:20)
um i've taken up so much space that's (77:17 - 77:22)
going to take away from zoroark working (77:20 - 77:23)
so zoroark's not going to work and (77:22 - 77:26)
roselia's not going to do anything no no (77:23 - 77:27)
no you don't need but do you don't need (77:26 - 77:29)
pichu to play pikachu usually baby (77:27 - 77:31)
pokemon are like their own weird thing (77:29 - 77:32)
that they skip (77:31 - 77:33)
all right fine (77:32 - 77:34)
you would need (77:33 - 77:37)
uh roselia and roserade and i think you (77:34 - 77:39)
would be fine no no no you don't want (77:37 - 77:42)
her a rosary you don't want no rose rose (77:39 - 77:43)
i don't know what rose rate is doing in (77:42 - 77:46)
the tcg here's the thing i put the call (77:43 - 77:49)
out and the community was like nah dawg (77:46 - 77:51)
and the other the other problem which i (77:49 - 77:52)
didn't think of (77:51 - 77:54)
is which is (77:52 - 77:56)
you know i i understand like you know i (77:54 - 77:59)
have been doing tcgs (77:56 - 78:01)
in depth for a long time and it's (77:59 - 78:03)
foolish of me but (78:01 - 78:04)
yeah (78:03 - 78:07)
like the other people don't pick up (78:04 - 78:09)
when you go into a trading card store a (78:07 - 78:11)
card store (78:09 - 78:14)
and 90 of card stores out there will (78:11 - 78:16)
have this same thing they will have a (78:14 - 78:17)
glass (78:16 - 78:20)
display counter (78:17 - 78:21)
and what will you find in that glass (78:20 - 78:24)
display counter you will find (78:21 - 78:27)
no charizard you will find (78:24 - 78:31)
as many old magic cards (78:27 - 78:32)
that they have that they want to sell (78:31 - 78:34)
for a thousand two thousand dollars if (78:32 - 78:37)
they can whatever you will find (78:34 - 78:39)
old yugioh cards (78:37 - 78:41)
on the occasion (78:39 - 78:43)
you will never (78:41 - 78:44)
ever (78:43 - 78:45)
find (78:44 - 78:50)
pokemon singles except for the most rare (78:45 - 78:52)
we only do pokemon card shop in the (78:50 - 78:54)
world (78:52 - 78:57)
so if there was a rosalia card eight (78:54 - 78:59)
years ago and you're like greg's like oh (78:57 - 79:01)
yeah i'll play that eight-year-old (78:59 - 79:03)
nobody has it nobody's gonna sell it to (79:01 - 79:05)
you because if it's rosalia it's not (79:03 - 79:07)
charizard it's not pikachu nobody held (79:05 - 79:10)
on to it they threw it away not zoroarc (79:07 - 79:12)
right it's it's you're not going to find (79:10 - 79:13)
it in a card shop (79:12 - 79:15)
good luck finding it on ebay these cards (79:13 - 79:18)
like nobody cares about old pokemon (79:15 - 79:21)
cards pokemon is all about (79:18 - 79:23)
even i i mean i don't know so much about (79:21 - 79:25)
expanded but it is all about whatever (79:23 - 79:28)
like the standard what is good now once (79:25 - 79:30)
it's not good anymore people do not hold (79:28 - 79:33)
on to those cards and the cards lose all (79:30 - 79:34)
value so they're like there's no sense (79:33 - 79:36)
even keeping this around anymore there (79:34 - 79:38)
are there are exceptions like full art (79:36 - 79:40)
like full art trainer cards will always (79:38 - 79:42)
like hold their value pretty okay but (79:40 - 79:42)
even completely (79:42 - 79:44)
like cards (79:42 - 79:46)
yeah but like actual pokemon like a like (79:44 - 79:48)
a hollow roselia from like five years (79:46 - 79:49)
ago (79:48 - 79:52)
probably 50 cents on tcgplayer (79:49 - 79:54)
if you can find it if somebody hasn't (79:52 - 79:57)
just thrown it in the trash (79:54 - 79:57)
i i (79:58 - 80:02)
would assume there would probably be a (80:00 - 80:05)
way to make brazilian work uh (80:02 - 80:08)
not according to everybody in the world (80:05 - 80:11)
challenge prove me wrong internet (80:08 - 80:14)
find some roselia deck that doesn't make (80:11 - 80:16)
you just cry and walk away from the (80:14 - 80:18)
table they're releasing gardenias (80:16 - 80:20)
roserade (80:18 - 80:22)
do you know what's like i remember first (80:20 - 80:23)
getting into the pokemon trading card (80:22 - 80:26)
game um it was me and my friend aaron (80:23 - 80:27)
we (80:26 - 80:30)
we he was actually the one that was like (80:27 - 80:32)
we should buy pokemon cards and i was (80:30 - 80:34)
like nah like i i'm poor i can't afford (80:32 - 80:36)
that hobby like it's it's too expensive (80:34 - 80:38)
i don't want to go back into collecting (80:36 - 80:40)
but he was like let's like it's 10 bucks (80:38 - 80:42)
let's just get like some like starter (80:40 - 80:43)
decks (80:42 - 80:44)
and uh (80:43 - 80:47)
we we went to the target we got the (80:44 - 80:49)
starter decks it was it was heart gold (80:47 - 80:51)
soul silver it was like uh undaunted or (80:49 - 80:53)
whatever (80:51 - 80:54)
like it was the end of heart cold soul (80:53 - 80:57)
silver and black and white stuff was was (80:54 - 80:58)
right around the corner (80:57 - 80:59)
and we played these starter decks (80:58 - 81:01)
together and it was like it was like fun (80:59 - 81:03)
but it was also like the the memories of (81:01 - 81:05)
like man starter decks are so bad like (81:03 - 81:09)
it's so bad 35 energies and now actually (81:05 - 81:11)
starter decks have gotten really really (81:09 - 81:12)
good (81:11 - 81:15)
with like the sun and moon era and newer (81:12 - 81:16)
they've really like fixed starter decks (81:15 - 81:18)
there's still like some starter decks (81:16 - 81:19)
that are like oh don't ever buy the (81:18 - 81:20)
starter deck but there there have been (81:19 - 81:21)
starter decks that are like this is (81:20 - 81:23)
actually a great place to start with (81:21 - 81:25)
this starter deck (81:23 - 81:26)
um (81:25 - 81:30)
and i remember finding a group like the (81:26 - 81:32)
pokemon like miracle actually happened (81:30 - 81:34)
like i went to a local (81:32 - 81:35)
uh (81:34 - 81:38)
saturday play pokemon league or whatever (81:35 - 81:40)
um and they were having a tournament and (81:38 - 81:42)
i just like sat like i missed i didn't (81:40 - 81:44)
know they were having tournament i just (81:42 - 81:46)
went and then um somebody who listened (81:44 - 81:48)
to the show their name was kid they came (81:46 - 81:49)
up after the tournament they're like oh (81:48 - 81:52)
my gosh i love the show and then (81:49 - 81:54)
um we played and he was like very good (81:52 - 81:55)
and he like (81:54 - 81:57)
we like talked about stuff and then i (81:55 - 81:59)
met some of his friends and then all of (81:57 - 82:00)
a sudden (81:59 - 82:03)
i had like eight people to play tcg with (82:00 - 82:05)
and none of us at the time were like (82:03 - 82:07)
experts or played competitively like we (82:05 - 82:09)
we read (82:07 - 82:11)
or we would go to like six prizes i (82:09 - 82:12)
don't even think i think six prizes (82:11 - 82:14)
closed down but it was like a pokemon (82:12 - 82:15)
tcg website (82:14 - 82:18)
and we would just like build decks of (82:15 - 82:19)
our pokemon like i was like i really (82:18 - 82:21)
liked polytoad at the time i was like i (82:19 - 82:22)
want a polytoe deck and there just (82:21 - 82:23)
happened to be a poly toad card with an (82:22 - 82:25)
okay ability (82:23 - 82:26)
um (82:25 - 82:29)
and that like period of my life was (82:26 - 82:30)
probably like the most fun i had with (82:29 - 82:34)
pokemon tcg because it was just like (82:30 - 82:37)
four to eight people sitting (82:34 - 82:39)
like once a week (82:37 - 82:40)
like building these weird decks and (82:39 - 82:43)
playing with each other and like (82:40 - 82:44)
trying to understand the rules and like (82:43 - 82:46)
get better on the rules and be like hey (82:44 - 82:48)
you can't do that like learning it more (82:46 - 82:49)
that was always my problem with like (82:48 - 82:52)
getting into something like netrunner (82:49 - 82:53)
where like irene and i would play (82:52 - 82:55)
netrunner and it was like i'm not 100 (82:53 - 82:57)
sure if we're allowed to do this like (82:55 - 82:58)
i'm looking in the real book i can't (82:57 - 83:00)
really tell does this ruin or break the (82:58 - 83:01)
game (83:00 - 83:03)
um and we could never really find a (83:01 - 83:05)
netrunner meetup or anything like that (83:03 - 83:06)
but (83:05 - 83:08)
then when like i turned the leaf into (83:06 - 83:10)
like going to these pokemon tournaments (83:08 - 83:12)
and like trying to build these meta (83:10 - 83:14)
decks and like playing meta and like (83:12 - 83:15)
trying to build rogue decks of counter (83:14 - 83:17)
meta like it was still fun but like (83:15 - 83:19)
there was like that like small point (83:17 - 83:20)
where like (83:19 - 83:21)
you had like six (83:20 - 83:22)
people (83:21 - 83:24)
in a small apartment all just playing (83:22 - 83:26)
these like really random decks of like (83:24 - 83:28)
their favorite pokemon and stuff like (83:26 - 83:30)
you can still have a bunch of fun there (83:28 - 83:31)
but like (83:30 - 83:32)
yeah i don't know if if you build a (83:31 - 83:34)
roselia deck and then you go against (83:32 - 83:36)
like whatever the meta is which i think (83:34 - 83:38)
right now is like mew and whatever like (83:36 - 83:40)
obviously the person playing mew has (83:38 - 83:42)
like the distinct advantage but like (83:40 - 83:44)
it's still possible for the (83:42 - 83:46)
deck to win and going to a tournament (83:44 - 83:48)
and playing these i'm saying i just want (83:46 - 83:49)
to play a deck that i would enjoy with (83:48 - 83:51)
my friends because your mistake is (83:49 - 83:53)
number one you want to play a deck (83:51 - 83:55)
uh because it's going to be so bad that (83:53 - 83:57)
you're not going to want to play it man (83:55 - 83:59)
kid ruined my life (83:57 - 84:01)
now i am just you have just i have (83:59 - 84:04)
realized this because man he is the one (84:01 - 84:06)
who got me into trading card games and (84:04 - 84:08)
if anybody could see the background that (84:06 - 84:10)
these guys can see that you can't see on (84:08 - 84:11)
youtube (84:10 - 84:14)
my my life is destroyed by trading card (84:11 - 84:15)
games now (84:14 - 84:17)
yeah you know what's the best thing when (84:15 - 84:20)
you first go to a pokemon league it's (84:17 - 84:22)
the 12 year old who says what you're (84:20 - 84:24)
playing with a starter deck (84:22 - 84:26)
you're a fool (84:24 - 84:28)
and then yes (84:26 - 84:30)
stomp them into the right no no no (84:28 - 84:31)
because the starter decks can't win (84:30 - 84:34)
against a meta deck and you just (84:31 - 84:37)
get done (84:34 - 84:37)
question of the week what is the (84:38 - 84:43)
question of the week let's have the (84:40 - 84:45)
question of the week (84:43 - 84:49)
this is a tick tock thing (84:45 - 84:49)
and i don't know which one it is yeah (84:49 - 84:52)
i'm not going to tell you either suffer (84:51 - 84:54)
pope it's not my consciousness isn't the (84:52 - 84:58)
sixth dimension hmm (84:54 - 85:00)
this is from our attic channel in slack (84:58 - 85:02)
brandon i really do like this question (85:00 - 85:04)
where are the most interesting places (85:02 - 85:08)
you played pogo (85:04 - 85:08)
greg's thinking (85:13 - 85:16)
yeah i mean like (85:14 - 85:18)
it's not milwaukee for greg no (85:16 - 85:21)
god nothing's interesting in milwaukee (85:18 - 85:24)
uh i like so event wise like it's hard (85:21 - 85:27)
to separate because like chicago go fest (85:24 - 85:30)
and st louis safari park were great (85:27 - 85:31)
events (85:30 - 85:32)
but (85:31 - 85:35)
like those cities aren't interesting (85:32 - 85:37)
okay if the weather was nice (85:35 - 85:40)
that park was incredible yeah (85:37 - 85:42)
that park would be like a place i would (85:40 - 85:48)
love to go to play pogo consistently um (85:42 - 85:48)
um playing in dc was pretty cool (85:55 - 85:59)
well we played for um what was that it (86:00 - 86:04)
was like they had it was sweet [ __ ] (86:02 - 86:09)
sweet [ __ ] ray yeah yeah (86:04 - 86:09)
for me it's probably japan (86:10 - 86:13)
i've been playing playing in um (86:14 - 86:20)
i think playing in osaka (86:18 - 86:23)
was more exciting than (86:20 - 86:25)
tokyo (86:23 - 86:27)
because tokyo is very (86:25 - 86:30)
very big um and very spread out (86:27 - 86:31)
and (86:30 - 86:34)
like there are pockets of tokyo uh like (86:31 - 86:35)
shibuya (86:34 - 86:38)
uh which (86:35 - 86:38)
like things were happening but i think (86:39 - 86:43)
in osaka (86:40 - 86:44)
um (86:43 - 86:46)
that is where like every single raid was (86:44 - 86:48)
like constantly filling up there was (86:46 - 86:50)
like no event i think it was i think (86:48 - 86:51)
dialga was maybe in raids it was like (86:50 - 86:53)
the first time diago was in raids (86:51 - 86:54)
couldn't be shiny (86:53 - 86:56)
um but like (86:54 - 86:58)
osaka was more (86:56 - 87:00)
[Music] (86:58 - 87:02)
i don't want to say like jam-packed but (87:00 - 87:03)
it just felt like because everything was (87:02 - 87:05)
so close together like once like we had (87:03 - 87:07)
to take the train into like the downtown (87:05 - 87:08)
area which was only like a 10 minute (87:07 - 87:10)
ride (87:08 - 87:11)
and then once we were there it was just (87:10 - 87:14)
like you reached and could see so many (87:11 - 87:16)
gyms and stops and like everything was (87:14 - 87:18)
always filled and if you were in like a (87:16 - 87:19)
store or something you could still reach (87:18 - 87:22)
the gyms and that was like a really (87:19 - 87:24)
really cool experience and it was like i (87:22 - 87:26)
remember there was a mcdonald's down up (87:24 - 87:27)
like a (87:26 - 87:29)
in sandwich in between a bunch of like (87:27 - 87:31)
because everything on in japan is like (87:29 - 87:32)
on top of each other so there's like a (87:31 - 87:34)
mcdonald's sandwich in between a bunch (87:32 - 87:35)
of stuff (87:34 - 87:37)
and it was just a dialga raid (87:35 - 87:40)
and irene and i ended up in separate (87:37 - 87:43)
raids and both ones filled like both got (87:40 - 87:46)
to 20 instantly and you could just like (87:43 - 87:47)
look around because it was also near (87:46 - 87:48)
that huge bridge that went over the (87:47 - 87:50)
water i don't know like if you know (87:48 - 87:51)
osaka you know exactly where i'm talking (87:50 - 87:53)
about like this bridge and then there's (87:51 - 87:55)
like this neon like red person on the (87:53 - 87:57)
sign and then there's the mcdonald's if (87:55 - 88:00)
you saw if you if you if you've been (87:57 - 88:01)
there you know exactly where i'm talking (88:00 - 88:02)
about (88:01 - 88:04)
but it was crazy just to see all of (88:02 - 88:07)
these people join this mcdonald's raid (88:04 - 88:08)
and look around and you could just see (88:07 - 88:10)
everyone tapping their screen and again (88:08 - 88:11)
there was like no event there was like (88:10 - 88:13)
no special bonuses it was just a normal (88:11 - 88:16)
like thursday afternoon for pogo and (88:13 - 88:18)
then once the raid was over you just saw (88:16 - 88:21)
everyone like disperse (88:18 - 88:23)
and just like leave and it was like very (88:21 - 88:25)
cool and i think greg is correct like (88:23 - 88:29)
it's hard to separate events right (88:25 - 88:31)
versus just like a normal day of pogo (88:29 - 88:33)
and that that to me that normal day of (88:31 - 88:37)
pogo just felt very surreal of like (88:33 - 88:39)
being in japan doing that (88:37 - 88:40)
local like (88:39 - 88:42)
i think seattle is very interesting to (88:40 - 88:44)
play because seattle's just oh (88:42 - 88:46)
interestingly laid out city (88:44 - 88:48)
um (88:46 - 88:52)
i did not like playing in dallas (88:48 - 88:52)
that's way too spread out (88:52 - 88:56)
um (89:01 - 89:04)
i played in l.a l.a was (89:04 - 89:11)
fine just la is not a great walking city (89:06 - 89:12)
i still i still like playing in boston a (89:11 - 89:13)
lot (89:12 - 89:15)
i haven't played there yet but i'll find (89:13 - 89:17)
out so boston if you want to move to the (89:15 - 89:20)
top of the list make it special (89:17 - 89:23)
um yeah i in like austin austin texas (89:20 - 89:25)
went down there for pax it was it was (89:23 - 89:27)
okay nothing like super special (89:25 - 89:29)
everything like i think (89:27 - 89:32)
no no not austin um san antonio san (89:29 - 89:35)
antonio yes san antonio my bad i have (89:32 - 89:36)
been to austin and i have played in (89:35 - 89:38)
austin but same thing with greg it's (89:36 - 89:39)
like everything is spread out you got to (89:38 - 89:40)
drive (89:39 - 89:42)
wow i mean like (89:40 - 89:42)
well (89:42 - 89:45)
it's like the most walkable city (89:42 - 89:47)
anywhere okay so my friends lived in (89:45 - 89:49)
austin but they lived at the outskirts (89:47 - 89:50)
of austin (89:49 - 89:53)
oh yeah (89:50 - 89:53)
we had to get in a car drive to the (89:55 - 89:59)
downtown area it's like i don't think (89:57 - 90:02)
downtown austin was as great as like (89:59 - 90:05)
downtown boston or downtown seattle (90:02 - 90:06)
i would say those were better places (90:05 - 90:08)
yeah i think down to i think downtown (90:06 - 90:10)
seattle is a great is a really good (90:08 - 90:12)
place and there's a lot there (90:10 - 90:14)
it's really easy to walk to all this (90:12 - 90:15)
because like (90:14 - 90:17)
down by the convention centers was where (90:15 - 90:19)
mostly i've played pogo (90:17 - 90:21)
um it's really easy to get to a lot of (90:19 - 90:24)
places (90:21 - 90:27)
so i'm gonna i'll stick with seattle (90:24 - 90:27)
until boston make it special (90:28 - 90:34)
good luck (90:31 - 90:34)
we're gonna get another awkward comment (90:50 - 90:54)
on the youtube because this silence is (90:52 - 90:55)
long (90:54 - 90:57)
no i'll cut it i'll cut it maybe i won't (90:55 - 91:00)
you never cut anything from youtube (90:57 - 91:02)
i have cut things from the youtube like (91:00 - 91:03)
sometimes like (91:02 - 91:05)
um (91:03 - 91:06)
it depends (91:05 - 91:09)
uh this is from tim (91:06 - 91:11)
i'm not good (91:09 - 91:12)
i just think this question's funny i'm (91:11 - 91:14)
not gonna pretend this is tim from the (91:12 - 91:16)
youtube if you wanna leave a comment on (91:14 - 91:18)
our youtube um like comment subscribe (91:16 - 91:20)
all that stuff (91:18 - 91:22)
i'm not going to pretend to understand (91:20 - 91:24)
blockchain's dlts but what are your all (91:22 - 91:25)
thoughts on (91:24 - 91:28)
implementing an almost nft for the (91:25 - 91:30)
record i hate i think it entails nfgs (91:28 - 91:31)
are bad (91:30 - 91:34)
both of you but go ahead style system in (91:31 - 91:37)
pokemon where you could obtain (91:34 - 91:39)
buy or obtain in-game pokemon you would (91:37 - 91:43)
own regardless of games (91:39 - 91:47)
um so for example a new animal crossing (91:43 - 91:48)
comes out boom you can display your (91:47 - 91:50)
pokemon in it uh (91:48 - 91:53)
boom your pokemon is in your vr house (91:50 - 91:55)
uh pokemon could be displayed on your (91:53 - 91:58)
profile i'm not necessarily supportive (91:55 - 91:59)
of this idea but i would be interested (91:58 - 92:01)
to hear your discussion one is called (91:59 - 92:03)
amiibo (92:01 - 92:05)
[Laughter] (92:03 - 92:07)
two it's a bad idea (92:05 - 92:08)
i (92:07 - 92:11)
i i think i fundamentally (92:08 - 92:13)
have a have an issue with this question (92:11 - 92:17)
because pokemon already are nfts (92:13 - 92:20)
they're they're digital tokens (92:17 - 92:23)
that represent something (92:20 - 92:25)
right now they don't have commercial (92:23 - 92:26)
value although i (92:25 - 92:28)
we've discussed in the past people do (92:26 - 92:29)
sell (92:28 - 92:32)
the electronic pokemon on (92:29 - 92:34)
ebay even though that's illegal and (92:32 - 92:36)
they're tradable (92:34 - 92:38)
yeah (92:36 - 92:41)
um yeah i saw some article of somebody (92:38 - 92:43)
being like hey we're turning pokemon (92:41 - 92:46)
cards into nfts and i was like do you (92:43 - 92:48)
d do you not know that the pokemon (92:46 - 92:50)
trading card game online has existed (92:48 - 92:52)
exactly they're already like they're (92:50 - 92:54)
already like (92:52 - 92:56)
a full art cynthia in the pokemon (92:54 - 92:58)
trading card game online is like 40 (92:56 - 93:00)
packs (92:58 - 93:02)
and four that's like a lot of packs for (93:00 - 93:04)
just you know cynthia (93:02 - 93:06)
um it started barring the (93:04 - 93:10)
discussion of (93:06 - 93:12)
the many many many many many issues with (93:10 - 93:14)
nfts (93:12 - 93:17)
and what nfts represent i (93:14 - 93:20)
much like amiibos much like (93:17 - 93:24)
anything where you are selling (93:20 - 93:24)
quote-unquote ownership it is (93:24 - 93:28)
it is not sort of a great idea (93:30 - 93:33)
like (93:33 - 93:36)
to like break it down into (93:33 - 93:37)
[Music] (93:36 - 93:39)
you (93:37 - 93:41)
the way to i mean so anytime you're (93:39 - 93:42)
going to add in (93:41 - 93:44)
monetary value you're also going to have (93:42 - 93:46)
to try to add in scarcity (93:44 - 93:49)
because people who own that thing want (93:46 - 93:51)
there to be not many of them (93:49 - 93:53)
because the way that an nft is going to (93:51 - 93:55)
work is there can only be so many of (93:53 - 93:56)
them so then we're getting into the fact (93:55 - 93:58)
that well (93:56 - 94:00)
they put up (93:58 - 94:03)
10 arceus for sale (94:00 - 94:04)
they all got purchased (94:03 - 94:06)
and those are now the only ten archies (94:04 - 94:08)
that are ever going to exist wow and (94:06 - 94:10)
those people own them that's a very (94:08 - 94:13)
limited point of view on what the (94:10 - 94:15)
concept of nfts can mean it does it (94:13 - 94:17)
doesn't have to be (94:15 - 94:20)
monetary it doesn't have to be um (94:17 - 94:23)
it doesn't have to be a sort of a (94:20 - 94:26)
a value engine of being limited supply (94:23 - 94:28)
nft could solely mean (94:26 - 94:31)
oh boy i can't (94:28 - 94:33)
i can't get into my like four-hour (94:31 - 94:35)
lecture on what nfd's i mean but if (94:33 - 94:37)
we're gonna if they're not gonna add (94:35 - 94:38)
in (94:37 - 94:40)
scarcity then we already have it with (94:38 - 94:42)
home and yes bank you cut it once and (94:40 - 94:45)
you move forward but the the difference (94:42 - 94:48)
is and what what (94:45 - 94:49)
sort of there's the thing that people (94:48 - 94:52)
see with nfts which is like the crypto (94:49 - 94:54)
punks or the board apes or the thing (94:52 - 94:56)
that's being sold oh those dumb monkeys (94:54 - 94:58)
oh (94:56 - 95:01)
they're apes they're that okay and if (94:58 - 95:02)
that is what you see when people talk (95:01 - 95:05)
about nfts just take my first word for (95:02 - 95:07)
this you're looking at the wrong thing (95:05 - 95:10)
the issue of nfts is the concept of (95:07 - 95:13)
ownership and proof of ownership and how (95:10 - 95:16)
that is publicly known which currently (95:13 - 95:18)
in the art world which is what this is (95:16 - 95:22)
sort of like a digital critique of is (95:18 - 95:24)
somebody could own a piece of art (95:22 - 95:27)
and there may be a paper contract in a (95:24 - 95:29)
locker somewhere that says that but it's (95:27 - 95:31)
not publicly known (95:29 - 95:34)
with nfts everybody knows that you own a (95:31 - 95:37)
particular something so you could have (95:34 - 95:39)
pokemon on the blockchain and it says (95:37 - 95:41)
basically every my pokemon home is (95:39 - 95:43)
registered on the blockchain and anybody (95:41 - 95:45)
who wants to look can see exactly which (95:43 - 95:48)
pokemon that i have in my pokemon home (95:45 - 95:50)
no money no nothing like that's not (95:48 - 95:53)
involved and then therefore it could go (95:50 - 95:55)
for what this person was asking and then (95:53 - 95:58)
say all right if another game (95:55 - 96:00)
non-pokemon game wants to access the (95:58 - 96:02)
blockchain and say all right so these (96:00 - 96:04)
are will's pokemon he has proof of (96:02 - 96:06)
ownership of these on the blockchain we (96:04 - 96:08)
can now represent them in this other (96:06 - 96:09)
game (96:08 - 96:11)
that's fine and it doesn't have to be (96:09 - 96:13)
about money (96:11 - 96:15)
except it's about money i mean it (96:13 - 96:18)
doesn't it does it's that's (96:15 - 96:20)
my problem with um it's a limited view (96:18 - 96:22)
that is based off of where we are in (96:20 - 96:23)
late stage capitalism which created (96:22 - 96:25)
blockchains and nfts (96:23 - 96:26)
like (96:25 - 96:28)
they can do that now if they really (96:26 - 96:30)
wanted to do that free for everybody why (96:28 - 96:33)
am i else am i paying 16.99 a year for (96:30 - 96:35)
pokemon home (96:33 - 96:37)
i have proof of registry well wouldn't (96:35 - 96:40)
it be better if you just had a wallet a (96:37 - 96:42)
big i don't see a bitcoin wallet but a (96:40 - 96:44)
wallet i mean that's what home is (96:42 - 96:46)
supposed to be it's on my mobile phone (96:44 - 96:47)
it is a variation on that which well i (96:46 - 96:48)
think part of the problem with like (96:47 - 96:50)
pokemon (96:48 - 96:52)
outside of pokemon go and pokemon go (96:50 - 96:54)
still has this problem is is like the (96:52 - 96:57)
hacked or duplication or whatever (96:54 - 96:58)
that (96:57 - 97:00)
i don't think i'm pretty sure the (96:58 - 97:02)
pokemon company doesn't like that like (97:00 - 97:04)
pk hex exists i'm pretty sure the (97:02 - 97:05)
pokemon company doesn't like that (97:04 - 97:08)
somebody is selling a copy of x and y on (97:05 - 97:11)
ebay for forty dollars and it says like (97:08 - 97:12)
all six hundred and forty nine shiny (97:11 - 97:15)
pokemon and a thousand master balls (97:12 - 97:16)
right (97:15 - 97:18)
like heck still exists oh absolutely (97:16 - 97:22)
yeah oh yeah yeah um (97:18 - 97:24)
if (97:22 - 97:26)
like i i (97:24 - 97:28)
like to collect shiny pokemon right and (97:26 - 97:31)
i i i think there is there's always a (97:28 - 97:33)
conversation of what shiny pokemon are (97:31 - 97:36)
worth and (97:33 - 97:36)
and if shiny pokemon were worth (97:37 - 97:41)
something (97:40 - 97:44)
they they could be tradable no money (97:41 - 97:47)
aside like what will was saying like if (97:44 - 97:52)
i got a shiny authentic synthy (97:47 - 97:55)
which would arguably be a a very (97:52 - 97:57)
hard shiny to find (97:55 - 98:00)
um although like because somebody could (97:57 - 98:01)
be starting that hunt and get it into (98:00 - 98:02)
encounters somebody could be starting (98:01 - 98:04)
that hunt and get it in two years right (98:02 - 98:08)
like it's just random it's just r g (98:04 - 98:08)
there is no like there is no marketplace (98:08 - 98:13)
i'm using marketplace loosely because (98:11 - 98:15)
again no money aside but there's no (98:13 - 98:18)
nothing stating that shiny authentic (98:15 - 98:21)
synthetic is worth (98:18 - 98:24)
too shiny snorlax or or you know what i (98:21 - 98:26)
mean like there is no like fair trade (98:24 - 98:29)
it's just what people (98:26 - 98:31)
deem that what they would want in (98:29 - 98:33)
exchange where i would argue that the (98:31 - 98:36)
pokemon trading card game online had a (98:33 - 98:38)
marketplace right like (98:36 - 98:42)
a digital version of cynthia (98:38 - 98:44)
which was a supporter card you know (98:42 - 98:46)
shuffle your hand into your deck draw (98:44 - 98:47)
six cards (98:46 - 98:50)
was worth 40 digital packs (98:47 - 98:53)
of unopened pokemon cards like that is a (98:50 - 98:55)
that is a (98:53 - 98:58)
nft like situation of like this digital (98:55 - 99:00)
good is worth these digital goods and we (98:58 - 99:02)
are now trading for that but there is no (99:00 - 99:04)
receipt (99:02 - 99:05)
um and i'm not going to say i understand (99:04 - 99:07)
nfts with the receipts and all that (99:05 - 99:09)
stuff but like (99:07 - 99:11)
i feel like pokemon would be worth (99:09 - 99:13)
something if if there wasn't just like (99:11 - 99:16)
the ability to like duplicate or or make (99:13 - 99:19)
your own or a hack or or (99:16 - 99:20)
whatever (99:19 - 99:23)
because the pokemon company is doing (99:20 - 99:24)
it's almost like the pokemon company (99:23 - 99:27)
wants that like you can only get shaymin (99:24 - 99:29)
from these 20 days hey if you don't get (99:27 - 99:32)
dark cry by the end of april you will no (99:29 - 99:35)
longer get dark cry in brilliant diamond (99:32 - 99:36)
shining pearl hey did you buy brilliant (99:35 - 99:38)
diamond shining pearl guess what you (99:36 - 99:40)
can't get manafee anymore because that (99:38 - 99:42)
person just doesn't give you that egg (99:40 - 99:45)
anymore um if you miss shaman 16 days (99:42 - 99:47)
ago sorry you can't get shaymin it's (99:45 - 99:50)
like they want to create these very rare (99:47 - 99:53)
very sought after pokemon (99:50 - 99:56)
and (99:53 - 99:56)
those pokemon should have some sort of (99:56 - 100:01)
like value whether that's that whether (99:58 - 100:02)
that's like a memory (100:01 - 100:04)
or whether that's like a collection (100:02 - 100:06)
person purpose or whether that's like i (100:04 - 100:08)
got an extra shaman you missed out on (100:06 - 100:12)
that shaymin i missed out on this event (100:08 - 100:14)
that you have extras of let's trade (100:12 - 100:16)
because that's fair or that's like equal (100:14 - 100:19)
of quote-unquote value (100:16 - 100:20)
but we just don't have that i guess the (100:19 - 100:23)
closest we have that to is pogo (100:20 - 100:24)
where like if i (100:23 - 100:28)
find a shiny rock ruff in pogo that's a (100:24 - 100:30)
that's at this point as of this (100:28 - 100:32)
recording shiny rock ruff is very sought (100:30 - 100:34)
after in the community like people would (100:32 - 100:37)
probably trade a (100:34 - 100:39)
shiny snorlax which is also pretty (100:37 - 100:41)
sought after in the community somebody (100:39 - 100:43)
could be like i want to trade my shiny (100:41 - 100:44)
snorlax for your shiny rock rough (100:43 - 100:46)
because rock ruff's my favorite pokemon (100:44 - 100:47)
i've spent (100:46 - 100:49)
fifty dollars on raid passes i haven't (100:47 - 100:51)
gotten rock rough yet but even so (100:49 - 100:53)
pokemon go is kind of (100:51 - 100:55)
um (100:53 - 100:57)
spoofing kind of (100:55 - 100:59)
gets rid of that right but like at least (100:57 - 101:00)
there's like i don't know maybe there is (100:59 - 101:04)
p pkx for pokemon go i don't know (101:00 - 101:06)
but like i mean probably prob (101:04 - 101:08)
there's probably some manipulation there (101:06 - 101:11)
but i i think like (101:08 - 101:11)
pokemon is like far away from (101:12 - 101:16)
that kind of like weird (101:17 - 101:22)
value for value kind of thing not money (101:19 - 101:23)
but like (101:22 - 101:26)
what is what is this worth compared to (101:23 - 101:28)
what this is worth in the sense of like (101:26 - 101:32)
closer to the pokemon trading card game (101:28 - 101:35)
i don't know it's all weird (101:32 - 101:36)
just like (101:35 - 101:36)
have fun (101:36 - 101:40)
[Laughter] (101:36 - 101:42)
but like i don't think i don't think (101:40 - 101:43)
pokemon as a whole is against that (101:42 - 101:45)
because the pokemon trading card game (101:43 - 101:46)
exists like the physical version of the (101:45 - 101:48)
pokemon trading card game exists where (101:46 - 101:49)
like (101:48 - 101:52)
like if you were a kid back in the 90s (101:49 - 101:54)
and you had a charizard and somebody (101:52 - 101:56)
wanted your charizard (101:54 - 101:59)
they would have to trade you a lot of (101:56 - 102:01)
other pokemon to trade for that (101:59 - 102:03)
charizard like it wasn't like charizard (102:01 - 102:04)
for blastoise was a fair deal it was (102:03 - 102:07)
like not nah nah if i if you want my (102:04 - 102:09)
charizard i want a blastoise i want an (102:07 - 102:12)
alakazam i want a mewtwo and i want a (102:09 - 102:14)
gloom i want like those four cards for (102:12 - 102:16)
this charizard like it's (102:14 - 102:18)
like they're not i don't think pokemon (102:16 - 102:21)
as a whole is ever against like (102:18 - 102:25)
the trading aspect now now listen listen (102:21 - 102:27)
to me right now i have an offer for both (102:25 - 102:28)
of you (102:27 - 102:30)
okay whoever is the highest bidder i (102:28 - 102:31)
have an ancient mew (102:30 - 102:34)
[Laughter] (102:31 - 102:35)
rare (102:34 - 102:37)
rare value zero value (102:35 - 102:40)
that that you two can fight over right (102:37 - 102:44)
now can i can i offer a gold poliwhirl (102:40 - 102:46)
burger king (102:44 - 102:48)
no i already i already have one of those (102:46 - 102:50)
okay unfortunately that's that's the (102:48 - 102:51)
best i could do (102:50 - 102:54)
um pokemon of the week all right last (102:51 - 102:57)
week's pokemon let me get that up on the (102:54 - 102:59)
screen here (102:57 - 103:01)
i forgot to write something down it was (102:59 - 103:03)
it was only one sentence so it's super (103:01 - 103:05)
easy and you'll get it quick (103:03 - 103:07)
uh so last week's pokemon this is a (103:05 - 103:09)
pokemon whose name could be taken to (103:07 - 103:14)
mean shade that is to say out of the sun (103:09 - 103:14)
wow (103:18 - 103:20)

system because it revolves around star (103:38 - 103:43)

like the sun (103:56 - 103:59)
it's dark type (103:58 - 104:01)
that's why i said it because it doesn't (103:59 - 104:03)
that's i said its name (104:01 - 104:07)
oh goodness gracious (104:03 - 104:07)

accessing the spear pillar before (104:34 - 104:39)
geratina is released by team galactic (104:36 - 104:41)
in black and white absolutely can be (104:39 - 104:44)
vine by the giant chasm (104:41 - 104:45)
chasm (104:44 - 104:48)
chasm a place where disasters are said (104:45 - 104:49)
to be fall trainers (104:48 - 104:52)
and route 13 13 being known as an (104:49 - 104:54)
unlucky number (104:52 - 104:57)

um absol was the last year's answer to (105:31 - 105:37)
pokemon's trainer's choice good enough (105:34 - 105:39)

understand all right this week's pokemon (106:53 - 106:59)
this week's pokemon will either be easy (106:57 - 107:01)
or difficult for fans of the pokemon (106:59 - 107:05)
game pokemon legends arceus to identify (107:01 - 107:07)
this pokemon is one of those with an (107:05 - 107:09)
alternate regional form albeit an (107:07 - 107:11)
unheralded one (107:09 - 107:14)
while it is not a baby pokemon it is one (107:11 - 107:16)
of those varieties that is easily (107:14 - 107:18)
ignored and typically unloved like a (107:16 - 107:21)
memorial plaque at a rest stop on i-70 (107:18 - 107:22)
in ohio (107:21 - 107:24)
in fact (107:22 - 107:26)
in the game where this pokemon first (107:24 - 107:28)
appeared it is the only one of that (107:26 - 107:32)
variety to receive a regional form (107:28 - 107:34)
originally it could have been described (107:32 - 107:37)
as the kleenex pokemon but its new form (107:34 - 107:38)
is more like the letters you receive in (107:37 - 107:41)
