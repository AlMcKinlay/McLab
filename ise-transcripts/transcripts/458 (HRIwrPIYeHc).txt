[Music] (0:01 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 450 (0:26 - 0:30)
458th (0:29 - 0:33)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:30 - 0:34)
super effective (0:33 - 0:38)
a super effective 25th anniversary to (0:34 - 0:38)
you (0:38 - 0:42)
and my co-host i am your host (0:38 - 0:46)
svj and uh with me is will (0:42 - 0:50)
i do you ever have this experience where (0:46 - 0:53)
you are taking apart your desk so you (0:50 - 0:55)
can move it to your new house (0:53 - 0:57)
and you put the screws for the different (0:55 - 0:59)
sections of the desk in each of your (0:57 - 1:01)
different pockets of your jeans (0:59 - 1:02)
and then you take the screwdriver that (1:01 - 1:04)
you're using to take apart the desk and (1:02 - 1:06)
you put it in your back pocket of your (1:04 - 1:06)
jeans (1:06 - 1:08)
so you're like i'm going to have that (1:06 - 1:10)
screwdriver when i need to put this desk (1:08 - 1:11)
back together (1:10 - 1:13)
and then for some reason you go in the (1:11 - 1:15)
kitchen and you put the screwdriver in (1:13 - 1:16)
the drawer because you need to take (1:15 - 1:17)
apart a chair and you think that the (1:16 - 1:19)
tool for the chair is in there and it's (1:17 - 1:20)
not and anyways (1:19 - 1:21)
that you don't take the chair apart and (1:20 - 1:23)
then you take the chair and the desk (1:21 - 1:24)
pieces to your car (1:23 - 1:25)
and then you say but wait the (1:24 - 1:27)
screwdriver is in that kitchen drawer i (1:25 - 1:28)
got to go back and get the screwdriver (1:27 - 1:30)
so you go back and you grab two boxes of (1:28 - 1:31)
clothes and put them in your car and (1:30 - 1:33)
drive to your new house (1:31 - 1:34)
and you get your new house and you try (1:33 - 1:36)
to put your desk together (1:34 - 1:38)
and there's no screwdriver it's in the (1:36 - 1:39)
drawer (1:38 - 1:42)
correct is the trick question i'm good (1:39 - 1:44)
at these escape room things (1:42 - 1:47)
so okay so now put the letter a (1:44 - 1:50)
and z on this area in the map that's (1:47 - 1:51)
going to open up (1:50 - 1:53)
a secret compartment and inside will be (1:51 - 1:54)
25th anniversary (1:53 - 1:58)
news wow i don't like (1:54 - 2:00)
the 20th anniversary why don't you like (1:58 - 2:02)
escape rooms because it's always one (2:00 - 2:03)
person in control (2:02 - 2:07)
it is not yeah it's you yeah i mean okay (2:03 - 2:09)
captain control would take over so the (2:07 - 2:10)
real escape room (2:09 - 2:14)
will be whether this hand-assembled desk (2:10 - 2:17)
is going to stay together throughout (2:14 - 2:18)
this recording (2:17 - 2:20)
or if it collapses on you uh greg is (2:18 - 2:21)
here i (2:20 - 2:23)
am here i am in a room that i'm not (2:21 - 2:25)
escaping from right now (2:23 - 2:27)
no matter how much i might want to (2:25 - 2:29)
people noticed your new bookshelf last (2:27 - 2:30)
time (2:29 - 2:33)
new bookshelf i i'm slowly adding things (2:30 - 2:35)
all over it's going to be (2:33 - 2:37)
a hunt to see what new things i've added (2:35 - 2:39)
as i rearrange (2:37 - 2:42)
the many rooms in my house i know that i (2:39 - 2:44)

the same uh alola special edition (2:44 - 2:51)
gift set dealie i moved that over i have (2:48 - 2:53)

remembered a where i put it which was on (2:56 - 3:00)
a stupid shelf (2:58 - 3:02)

looks good as a piece of decoration (3:02 - 3:06)
i'll put it up (3:04 - 3:06)
uh speaking of putting up we have uh to (3:07 - 3:10)
put up with the (3:09 - 3:14)
lack of 25th anniversary news (3:10 - 3:15)
that was actually one of your better (3:14 - 3:20)
transitions and i'm gonna actually say (3:15 - 3:21)
i mean it wasn't great but it was one of (3:20 - 3:23)
the better ones it was all right (3:21 - 3:26)
some we do have some pokemon there was (3:23 - 3:28)
another pokemon snap trailer (3:26 - 3:30)

probably for tv ones (3:30 - 3:34)
30 seconds a minute i didn't watch it i (3:31 - 3:35)
heard there's a new mythical (3:34 - 3:38)

that (3:51 - 3:55)
volcanion is attached to magnetically (3:53 - 3:58)
and he's very confused why (3:55 - 4:01)
is he (3:58 - 4:05)
because i feel like volcanion is just (4:01 - 4:06)
happy to be noticed (4:05 - 4:08)
i was just gonna say that he's happy (4:06 - 4:10)
with the attention he's the worst (4:08 - 4:11)

yeah volcanion has four nostrils what (4:31 - 4:36)
does male metal have (4:34 - 4:40)
one big eye (4:36 - 4:40)
thing it's got wires in its butt i'll (4:41 - 4:45)
give it that (4:44 - 4:46)
it does have wires in its butt that's (4:45 - 4:48)
true warrior booty (4:46 - 4:51)
i would say (4:48 - 4:51)
the one that came out with volcanion (4:53 - 4:59)
doesn't even have a story doesn't have (4:57 - 5:00)
at does this (4:59 - 5:03)

i know diancie's a (6:14 - 6:21)
a mythical right yeah but dancing is (6:18 - 6:23)
cool (6:21 - 6:25)
because dancing's like it's a carbine (6:23 - 6:27)
but it's a special carving (6:25 - 6:30)
yeah i like dancing well i mean (6:27 - 6:32)
volcanion is not (6:30 - 6:36)
great my geared at bottom bottom level (6:32 - 6:40)
the thing that makes volcanion cool is (6:36 - 6:43)
it was like i'm gonna say it this way (6:40 - 6:45)
it's gonna sound weird but you're gonna (6:43 - 6:47)
understand what i'm trying to say (6:45 - 6:52)
it was like six years ago (6:47 - 6:55)
we went through this list of hey they (6:52 - 6:57)
went in the code and found all of these (6:55 - 6:58)
pokemon (6:57 - 7:00)
that are gonna come out and then it's (6:58 - 7:02)
like six years later they're like hey (7:00 - 7:02)
remember (7:02 - 7:05)
we all found that code for volcanion (7:02 - 7:05)
remember (7:05 - 7:08)
here's your volcano it's tacked out at (7:05 - 7:09)
the end (7:08 - 7:11)
i was like but six years ago it sounded (7:09 - 7:13)
really cool we're gonna have a fire (7:11 - 7:14)
water pokemon (7:13 - 7:18)
and it's like not cool anymore (7:14 - 7:22)
i want to like zarud (7:18 - 7:26)
i just have no basis for zurude liking (7:22 - 7:29)
your hatred because the movie isn't even (7:26 - 7:32)
around yet at least not here is it out (7:29 - 7:33)
in japan when did that movie come out (7:32 - 7:35)

25th anniversary just haven't finished (7:42 - 7:45)
the movie and say this is the 25th (7:44 - 7:47)
anniversary movie and it would be (7:45 - 7:48)
something (7:47 - 7:49)
they just haven't gotten they don't want (7:48 - 7:52)
to overwhelm us (7:49 - 7:54)
you know to be fair we're good yeah to (7:52 - 7:55)
be fair (7:54 - 7:58)
we're getting a a pokemon game in (7:55 - 8:01)
five days game (7:58 - 8:01)
uh speaking of that pokemon game uh (8:02 - 8:07)
transitioned into some news here (8:05 - 8:09)
fujifilm (8:07 - 8:12)
launches a new app for the (8:09 - 8:14)
insta mini link now there's some (8:12 - 8:16)
confusion here (8:14 - 8:19)
so fujifilm (8:16 - 8:23)
yeah has a product called the insta (8:19 - 8:26)
instix insta it's insta then there's an (8:23 - 8:27)
x at the end i don't know if you're (8:26 - 8:28)
supposed to pronounce the x (8:27 - 8:31)
uh instax let's say in stacks i think (8:28 - 8:32)
it's just insta mini (8:31 - 8:34)
i think the x is just bad brains (8:32 - 8:36)
actually keep them getting sued by (8:34 - 8:37)
instagram (8:36 - 8:40)
yeah so (8:37 - 8:43)
they are releasing a pikachu (8:40 - 8:47)
version of this is it a version (8:43 - 8:51)
or is it a case it's a case (8:47 - 8:53)
technically it's a version how is it (8:51 - 8:54)
technically a version (8:53 - 8:56)
because the thing inside is the same old (8:54 - 8:58)
thing it is it's really dumb wow (8:56 - 8:59)
but you can say the same thing about the (8:58 - 9:02)
pikachu switch controller it's still the (8:59 - 9:04)
same switch controller on the inside (9:02 - 9:06)
but it's just got a cool pikachu graphic (9:04 - 9:09)
on it yeah okay so (9:06 - 9:10)
the printer itself doesn't have a (9:09 - 9:13)
graphic on it it's just the printer (9:10 - 9:16)
look so this was sent in by stuart this (9:13 - 9:17)
is off (9:16 - 9:20)
uh fujifilm's website if you (9:17 - 9:23)
what we need to back up the insta mini (9:20 - 9:23)
link (9:23 - 9:27)
is a polaroid (9:23 - 9:30)
printer not a camera wait no it's not a (9:27 - 9:32)
polaroid because (9:30 - 9:35)
that would be made by polaroids okay (9:32 - 9:37)
what do they call those photo printer (9:35 - 9:39)
it's a photo printer it's a photo (9:37 - 9:40)
printer but they look like polaroids how (9:39 - 9:42)
about that (9:40 - 9:44)
they look like polaroids it doesn't look (9:42 - 9:46)
like polarized they just have a big (9:44 - 9:48)
bar across them yeah they have they have (9:46 - 9:50)
the blank bar at the bottom yeah okay (9:48 - 9:53)
they do they have the blank bar at the (9:50 - 9:53)
bottom (9:53 - 9:56)
so it is a polaroid printer (9:53 - 9:59)
polaroid-esque printer a polaroid-esque (9:56 - 10:02)
printer (9:59 - 10:02)
or taken down here by the polaroid (10:03 - 10:08)
company which i'm pretty sure is still a (10:06 - 10:10)
valid concern (10:08 - 10:11)
i don't think polaroid's doing well at (10:10 - 10:12)
all right now right now doesn't matter a (10:11 - 10:13)
bunch of (10:12 - 10:16)
i bought their printable i bought their (10:13 - 10:17)
new polaroid (10:16 - 10:20)
camera slash printer for my wedding so (10:17 - 10:21)
people could take pictures and print (10:20 - 10:22)
them out (10:21 - 10:24)
that was like 10 years ago that was not (10:22 - 10:25)
10 years because (10:24 - 10:27)
it's 2014. and they're just gonna sue us (10:25 - 10:29)
for watering down their name that's how (10:27 - 10:31)
they do it i still have it i can dig it (10:29 - 10:32)
out here somewhere (10:31 - 10:35)
and i put it in this house so the insta (10:32 - 10:40)
mini link insta mini (10:35 - 10:42)
what is this called instagram smartphone (10:40 - 10:43)
printer (10:42 - 10:46)
uh it is just a printer (10:43 - 10:49)
it doesn't take pictures this is very (10:46 - 10:51)
hard on an audio podcast (10:49 - 10:54)
so they announced a special bundle uh (10:51 - 10:55)
which is an (10:54 - 10:58)
insta mini link (10:55 - 10:58)
white red and blue so that's what's (10:58 - 11:03)
exclusive the printer itself is mostly (11:01 - 11:05)
white and it has like a blue (11:03 - 11:07)
it has a little bit of blue and a little (11:05 - 11:10)
bit of red so there's your exclusivity (11:07 - 11:12)
because some of these printers are green (11:10 - 11:14)
or pink or (11:12 - 11:17)
purple we can get to that point and then (11:14 - 11:18)
it comes with a (11:17 - 11:22)
silicone case featuring pikachu (11:18 - 11:24)
and then on the like product box they (11:22 - 11:26)
have you know pokemon snap and animal (11:24 - 11:28)
crossing and some mario stuff (11:26 - 11:30)
and then there's a big like works with (11:28 - 11:32)
the nintendo switch (11:30 - 11:36)
so what fujifilm is doing (11:32 - 11:38)
is they're releasing a smartphone app (11:36 - 11:41)
called insta for a nintendo switch (11:38 - 11:44)
that you'll be able to download and then (11:41 - 11:45)
you can take (11:44 - 11:48)
the pictures that you take on your (11:45 - 11:49)
switch (11:48 - 11:51)
and then you can use that qr code thing (11:49 - 11:53)
that we talked about last week (11:51 - 11:56)
and you can send it to this app (11:53 - 11:58)
and then the app will send it to the (11:56 - 12:00)
printer and the printer will (11:58 - 12:04)
print your photos regardless of what (12:00 - 12:06)
game they are you can print your hades (12:04 - 12:08)
photos if you want to or your (12:06 - 12:10)
animal crossing photos ring fit photos (12:08 - 12:12)
that i accidentally take all the time (12:10 - 12:15)
um so that's all it is (12:12 - 12:18)
and that is the the the app is coming (12:15 - 12:21)
out on april 30th (12:18 - 12:21)
and then the in japan (12:21 - 12:28)
the silicone case featuring pikachu (12:25 - 12:29)
bundle (12:28 - 12:31)
red and blue instant mini link printer (12:29 - 12:34)
is coming out on april 30th (12:31 - 12:36)
and i believe unless something has (12:34 - 12:38)
changed in the last two days of be (12:36 - 12:40)
reading a different website the the (12:38 - 12:42)
pikachu one is coming to the united (12:40 - 12:44)
states in may (12:42 - 12:48)
but japan will get it this week (12:44 - 12:48)
now that being said the insta mini (12:50 - 12:57)
printer has existed since 2019 (12:54 - 12:59)
and you can just walk into a store and (12:57 - 13:00)
buy one right now i think they're like (12:59 - 13:02)
99 bucks or something (13:00 - 13:03)
have you ever seen one on the shelves of (13:02 - 13:06)
any store ever yeah target has them yeah (13:03 - 13:07)
target has them i've never (13:06 - 13:10)
target has like a whole aisle of like (13:07 - 13:11)
knockoff guard (13:10 - 13:13)
garbage electronics that i have no (13:11 - 13:14)
interest in i don't go to the (13:13 - 13:16)
electronics section and target (13:14 - 13:19)
i'm gonna say this dusky pink printer (13:16 - 13:20)
though it's (13:19 - 13:25)
really good how much (13:20 - 13:29)
uh well target says is 99.99 but (13:25 - 13:30)
okay target actually has this color in (13:29 - 13:34)
stock i'm just on the print (13:30 - 13:37)
website they may let's look you know i i (13:34 - 13:39)
i do think that this is going to sell (13:37 - 13:39)
out (13:39 - 13:41)
because everything pokemon related is (13:39 - 13:44)
selling out yes but also this (13:41 - 13:46)
this is not worthy to sit next to the (13:44 - 13:48)
ancient mew (13:46 - 13:51)
or the the burger king (13:48 - 13:53)
and the reason i say that is because if (13:51 - 13:55)
we look at the game boy printer (13:53 - 13:58)
it's not hard to find a used game boy (13:55 - 13:58)
printer (13:58 - 14:00)
i think it's actually harder to find the (13:58 - 14:03)
best game boy printer in my house (14:00 - 14:05)
i think it's harder to find the the (14:03 - 14:08)
printer paper for the game boy printer (14:05 - 14:10)
than it is the game boy printer did it (14:08 - 14:11)
use like thermal print (14:10 - 14:14)
or what did it do hey the pink one's in (14:11 - 14:15)
stock (14:14 - 14:18)
at my one of my local targets i could (14:15 - 14:20)
buy it for 99.99 i was just gonna say (14:18 - 14:21)
that the view from my new (14:20 - 14:24)
office is mostly home depot but a little (14:21 - 14:25)
bit target (14:24 - 14:28)
so i mean if you need me to just get up (14:25 - 14:30)
and run over there and take me about 15 (14:28 - 14:31)
minutes (14:30 - 14:33)
can you uh keep us updated on the price (14:31 - 14:35)
of number over there people like this (14:33 - 14:37)
product (14:35 - 14:37)
they're also leaving out that you have (14:37 - 14:41)
to buy (14:39 - 14:43)
the film packs for it oh yeah i already (14:41 - 14:45)
looked those up (14:43 - 14:49)
it was about 12.99 for 20 (14:45 - 14:52)
sheets on amazon which is like (14:49 - 14:55)
78 cents a sheet i think here's the real (14:52 - 14:56)
thing i'm (14:55 - 14:58)
if i can buy the pikachu one i will buy (14:56 - 15:01)
the pikachu one i'm not going to settle (14:58 - 15:05)
for any 2019 versions (15:01 - 15:08)
i just want the silicone case i want (15:05 - 15:11)
and i want the silicone case and the (15:08 - 15:13)
pink printer (15:11 - 15:16)
this this white red no nixon match sorry (15:13 - 15:20)
no mix and match i'm sure i can find (15:16 - 15:21)
i don't think they're gonna sell the (15:20 - 15:23)
silicone case separately they might (15:21 - 15:26)
you never know that's not how you make (15:23 - 15:27)
money (15:26 - 15:29)
yeah it is that's how you get how you (15:27 - 15:31)
make money a special edition on the side (15:29 - 15:33)
of a box and sell a product from 2019 (15:31 - 15:34)
that they probably (15:33 - 15:36)
already made a long time ago and they (15:34 - 15:38)
were like how do we put these on shelves (15:36 - 15:43)
let's throw a case in the box (15:38 - 15:43)
there ain't no nothing special about (15:44 - 15:47)
white red and blue unless (15:45 - 15:50)
you want to be like america i'm just (15:47 - 15:51)
gonna say (15:50 - 15:56)
or any other country (15:51 - 15:56)
do you know what's actually probably a (15:59 - 16:02)
better use of your money (16:01 - 16:05)
is just send your photos to walgreens (16:02 - 16:07)
how much is a print at walgreens it's (16:05 - 16:07)
like (16:07 - 16:10)
12 cents can i send my qr code to (16:07 - 16:12)
walgreens though (16:10 - 16:16)
yeah like it's it's so much cheaper (16:12 - 16:18)
the point of this printer is you carry (16:16 - 16:20)
it with you so that whether you're when (16:18 - 16:21)
you're with your friends (16:20 - 16:24)
you take snap a photo and then you print (16:21 - 16:25)
it and you're like hey friends (16:24 - 16:27)
remember that picnic we're at right now (16:25 - 16:29)
here's a photo of it (16:27 - 16:31)
if you have that it allows you to add (16:29 - 16:32)
backgrounds and stickers and stuff that (16:31 - 16:33)
you can't (16:32 - 16:36)
add to your walgreens i learned anything (16:33 - 16:37)
from ultrasound ultramoon (16:36 - 16:39)
it's putting stickers on photos is (16:37 - 16:43)
something that other people enjoy doing (16:39 - 16:43)
no one is walking around with a nintendo (16:44 - 16:48)
switch and a (16:47 - 16:51)
printer in their backpack the printer is (16:48 - 16:52)
versatile (16:51 - 16:55)
it's not just for the switch (16:52 - 16:57)
why do you think it has a silicon case (16:55 - 16:58)
so you can throw it in your bag right (16:57 - 17:01)
it is not just for the switch you could (16:58 - 17:02)
use probably one of the insta (17:01 - 17:05)
camera things and take a picture and (17:02 - 17:07)
link it there greg and i take photos (17:05 - 17:08)
together all the time they're very (17:07 - 17:10)
kawaii and we will put (17:08 - 17:12)
stickers on them that are like little (17:10 - 17:13)
hearts and like (17:12 - 17:16)
besto friendos it's 23 cents (17:13 - 17:20)
to make a picture print at walgreens 23 (17:16 - 17:21)
cents how much did you say (17:20 - 17:24)
the the the (17:21 - 17:27)
thing was 78 cents (17:24 - 17:29)
but no much difference for the (17:27 - 17:31)
convenience of having your own stickers (17:29 - 17:32)
in your app (17:31 - 17:35)
and printing it in your own home you (17:32 - 17:37)
captain i don't want to leave to have (17:35 - 17:39)
somebody else do my stuff (17:37 - 17:42)
are all about this printer life and also (17:39 - 17:44)
not having to go into a walgreens (17:42 - 17:45)
because (17:44 - 17:49)
i for as much as i hate cvs walgreens (17:45 - 17:52)
is probably (17:49 - 17:54)
for the lowest level pictures at (17:52 - 17:56)
walgreens or cvs is (17:54 - 17:59)
actually the easiest thing ever so is (17:56 - 18:01)
filling up your tires at a gas station (17:59 - 18:04)
yet you went and bought an air (18:01 - 18:06)
compressor for your car (18:04 - 18:08)
i did one number one milwaukee charges (18:06 - 18:09)
for (18:08 - 18:11)
air you could charge for printing at (18:09 - 18:12)
walgreens (18:11 - 18:14)
you get charged for air number two is (18:12 - 18:16)
not only did i fill my tires i filled (18:14 - 18:18)
irene's tires and i got a new snow (18:16 - 18:19)
blower which i needed to fill (18:18 - 18:22)
their tires that device is paying for (18:19 - 18:23)
itself greg (18:22 - 18:26)
and you can have multiple friends at an (18:23 - 18:28)
event all printing off of your one (18:26 - 18:30)
printer no without having to make a trip (18:28 - 18:32)
to an audio friends because you'll be (18:30 - 18:32)
thinking (18:32 - 18:34)
look at how much money i'm losing (18:32 - 18:35)
because it's it's (18:34 - 18:38)
78 cents a sheet you know because i (18:35 - 18:39)
can't put (18:38 - 18:42)
you put a price on joy you cannot put a (18:39 - 18:43)
price on joy (18:42 - 18:45)
i'm sure when this printer comes out (18:43 - 18:46)
it's going to go from 78 cents a sheet (18:45 - 18:48)
to like four dollars a sheet because all (18:46 - 18:50)
the scalpers are gonna buy out (18:48 - 18:54)
now buy it now that is your pro play (18:50 - 18:56)
you go to every target in your area buy (18:54 - 18:58)
all the sheets and throw it up (18:56 - 19:00)
on ebay and who cares about pokemon (18:58 - 19:03)
cards anymore you have maximized (19:00 - 19:06)
the insta max printer link (19:03 - 19:09)
market no this is what's going to happen (19:06 - 19:11)
people are gonna they wanna feel the (19:09 - 19:12)
nostalgia right they wanna they want (19:11 - 19:13)
that they want that (19:12 - 19:15)
feeling of blockbuster they're gonna go (19:13 - 19:17)
out buy this printer that has existed (19:15 - 19:18)
for two years that they've had no (19:17 - 19:20)
interest in for the last two years (19:18 - 19:22)
they're gonna buy this printer they're (19:20 - 19:23)
gonna buy a bunch of paper they're going (19:22 - 19:24)
to do it like (19:23 - 19:27)
twice on april 30th and may 1st and then (19:24 - 19:28)
they're it's just going to cut they're (19:27 - 19:30)
never going to touch it again (19:28 - 19:32)
because if they actually cared about a (19:30 - 19:34)
printable portable printable (19:32 - 19:37)
insta thing it's existed the product has (19:34 - 19:38)
been here it's (19:37 - 19:40)
existed before 2019 they just update it (19:38 - 19:42)
that's false because the whole reason (19:40 - 19:44)
i'm getting this is to print out all the (19:42 - 19:46)
photos i'm taking in pokemon snap which (19:44 - 19:47)
is a game gate (19:46 - 19:50)
based around taking photos but you can (19:47 - 19:52)
send them to walgreens and not spend (19:50 - 19:57)
a lot of time i don't go to walmart (19:52 - 19:57)
my picture though you can send them to (19:57 - 20:00)
cbs walgreens (19:58 - 20:02)
try to find a cvs in minnesota buddy (20:00 - 20:03)
that's not the (20:02 - 20:08)
one up the street but here's the thing (20:03 - 20:11)
can you send pictures from this (20:08 - 20:14)
wonderful app that gives you so many (20:11 - 20:15)
options (20:14 - 20:17)
to walgreens i think the answer is no (20:15 - 20:19)
well and walgreens doesn't let you put (20:17 - 20:23)
stickers on yeah you put the stickers on (20:19 - 20:26)
in the pokemon snap app but there are (20:23 - 20:26)
other ones (20:26 - 20:29)
in the smartlink app where am i going to (20:26 - 20:30)
get those (20:29 - 20:31)
where am i going to get those from where (20:30 - 20:33)
am i going to get this (20:31 - 20:35)
incredible mario face background to put (20:33 - 20:36)
on my selfie (20:35 - 20:40)
if i don't have this printer (20:36 - 20:40)
has like filters too doesn't it where (20:40 - 20:44)
it's like it can make me have kitty cat (20:42 - 20:45)
ears and stuff (20:44 - 20:47)
that's very important i want to buy the (20:45 - 20:48)
dumb printer (20:47 - 20:51)
don't get me wrong not (20:48 - 20:54)
don't say i don't want to you are going (20:51 - 20:55)
to buy the dollar (20:54 - 20:57)
there's definitely my instagram story to (20:55 - 20:59)
come out i will only (20:57 - 21:02)
pay msrp for the dumb printer not a (20:59 - 21:04)
dollar more whatever they don't have the (21:02 - 21:06)
price for what the pikachu version is (21:04 - 21:07)
going to be (21:06 - 21:09)
i would assume maybe like 120 if the (21:07 - 21:10)
normal one is 100 (21:09 - 21:12)
130 probably that silicon case is (21:10 - 21:14)
worthwhile yeah (21:12 - 21:16)
silicon case is legit probably get (21:14 - 21:19)
exclusive pokemon stickers (21:16 - 21:22)
but but let's be honest there is no one (21:19 - 21:23)
listing the show (21:22 - 21:25)
that is that is going to use this (21:23 - 21:27)
printer more than like four times and if (21:25 - 21:28)
they do it's only to (21:27 - 21:30)
spite me and the show to be like look i (21:28 - 21:32)
used it for a fifth time good and then (21:30 - 21:33)
the fifth time then they throw it in the (21:32 - 21:35)
closet next to the burger king gold (21:33 - 21:38)
coins where it will get money (21:35 - 21:41)
but the thing is you can use this like (21:38 - 21:45)
at parties if you could you could but (21:41 - 21:48)
we're talking about a game that we all (21:45 - 21:51)
think that is going to maybe be like one (21:48 - 21:54)
week or two weeks of enjoyment (21:51 - 21:57)
but the printer is is independent of (21:54 - 21:58)
reversal you (21:57 - 22:00)
you've already lived two plus years (21:58 - 22:02)
without the printer in your life (22:00 - 22:04)
because i didn't even know it existed i (22:02 - 22:06)
didn't know i needed it until now and (22:04 - 22:06)
now (22:06 - 22:10)
with all my parties that will happen (22:06 - 22:12)
soon sure how many times take pictures (22:10 - 22:14)
have greg and i (22:12 - 22:17)
done pokemon go community day and i wish (22:14 - 22:18)
we had a (22:17 - 22:20)
nice photograph i could put in a frame (22:18 - 22:21)
to commemorate (22:20 - 22:23)
the time that we spent together i did (22:21 - 22:24)
not know this printer (22:23 - 22:27)
existed and now that i know it's there i (22:24 - 22:28)
will have (22:27 - 22:30)
my desk will be covered in photos of me (22:28 - 22:31)
and greg (22:30 - 22:34)
think of how great canto day would have (22:31 - 22:34)
been (22:34 - 22:36)
if we were printing out pictures that (22:34 - 22:39)
entire time (22:36 - 22:39)
i know deep down inside you both hate (22:39 - 22:42)
this printer you're just (22:41 - 22:44)
playing devil's advocate right now i (22:42 - 22:46)
don't hate it (22:44 - 22:48)
i i just think you also don't have (22:46 - 22:49)
enough young people in your life (22:48 - 22:52)
because the teenagers in here boomer (22:49 - 22:54)
need to put stuff up in their lockers (22:52 - 22:56)
and they need to put pictures of their (22:54 - 22:58)
best friends with stickers that say (22:56 - 23:01)
aren't we cute and i have this entire (22:58 - 23:02)
blank (23:01 - 23:05)
closet door that could be covered in (23:02 - 23:07)
pictures right now and it's not because (23:05 - 23:09)
i never had the printer (23:07 - 23:12)
fair speaking of uh (23:09 - 23:15)
things that america will never get (23:12 - 23:19)
a pokemon themed fossil exhibit is (23:15 - 23:20)
opening in japan (23:19 - 23:22)
i want to go to this thing so bad let's (23:20 - 23:23)
go uh this is a (23:22 - 23:26)
uh kotaku (23:23 - 23:26)
let's cancel our our may travel plans (23:27 - 23:32)
and go to japan instead (23:30 - 23:36)
we have travel plans yes yes (23:32 - 23:38)
uh this was sent in by spencer from our (23:36 - 23:39)
slack community (23:38 - 23:43)
uh it will open this summer in japan (23:39 - 23:45)
according to the official announcement (23:43 - 23:47)
the expedition will let visitors observe (23:45 - 23:49)
and compare fossils from dinosaurs and (23:47 - 23:50)
other creatures as well as (23:49 - 23:53)
extinct plants and with pocket monsters (23:50 - 23:55)
with the ideal of hopefully showing (23:53 - 23:59)
how enjoyable paleontology is did i get (23:55 - 24:00)
that right (23:59 - 24:05)
close enough paleontology (24:00 - 24:09)
pale ale i'm reading this topology (24:05 - 24:10)
that's that that's the study of (24:09 - 24:11)
dinosaurs right this is the study of (24:10 - 24:14)
dinosaurs yes (24:11 - 24:15)
you're just saying it a little weird (24:14 - 24:18)
you're saying it a little weird (24:15 - 24:19)
do you know speaking of dinosaurs this (24:18 - 24:21)
is a side note i was playing (24:19 - 24:25)
uh jack box with some this was (24:21 - 24:26)
pretty pandemic i'll never forget the (24:25 - 24:29)
moment though because i was super salty (24:26 - 24:31)
am i allowed to express yes uh what's (24:29 - 24:32)
the game (24:31 - 24:35)
where they're like uh you gotta it's a (24:32 - 24:36)
quiz show but then they cut off your (24:35 - 24:37)
fingers and then they like stab your (24:36 - 24:38)
dolls (24:37 - 24:40)
oh oh my gosh i play that all the time (24:38 - 24:42)
burner mystery party yeah (24:40 - 24:44)
murder so we're playing murder mystery (24:42 - 24:46)
party and the question came up (24:44 - 24:50)
of like which dinosaur is not real (24:46 - 24:53)
and the answer is the the (24:50 - 24:56)
the long neck one the the brontosaurus (24:53 - 24:57)
brontosaurus from jurassic park right (24:56 - 24:59)
like that's not a real dinosaur well (24:57 - 25:01)
bronissary is from what we thought was (24:59 - 25:03)
real in science (25:01 - 25:05)
like jurassic park didn't invent the (25:03 - 25:07)
brontosaurus we thought the brontosaurus (25:05 - 25:09)
was a thing for a very long time (25:07 - 25:11)
right right but in jurassic park that (25:09 - 25:13)
was a rad dinosaur you're like (25:11 - 25:15)
check that it's like a giraffe and a (25:13 - 25:16)
thing and it's big (25:15 - 25:19)
um they have a couple in the flintstones (25:16 - 25:20)
i think it's an (25:19 - 25:24)
alias or now is it wait yeah (25:20 - 25:25)
it got converted to a different they got (25:24 - 25:27)
converted into a different thing but i (25:25 - 25:29)
knew that wasn't a real dinosaur (25:27 - 25:32)
and there was like i don't know seven or (25:29 - 25:34)
seven or eight of us in the room (25:32 - 25:36)
and i was the only one that got it right (25:34 - 25:38)
and the audacity of the people in this (25:36 - 25:40)
room being like (25:38 - 25:43)
did you actually know that steve or did (25:40 - 25:43)
you just (25:43 - 25:46)
lucky guess no i knew that wasn't a real (25:43 - 25:48)
dinosaur because i know my dinosaurs (25:46 - 25:51)
jeez i was i was legit that ruined my (25:48 - 25:53)
night it legit ruined my night i was so (25:51 - 25:55)
mad i mean (25:53 - 25:58)
to be fair nine times out of ten the (25:55 - 26:00)
answer that you give is yeah i guessed (25:58 - 26:03)
so the odds were stacked against you you (26:00 - 26:06)
don't have a lot to be angry about since (26:03 - 26:08)
most of the time you are flying by the (26:06 - 26:11)
city of your pants (26:08 - 26:15)
look i'm pretty dumb (26:11 - 26:18)
that's the point but i know your (26:15 - 26:19)
dinosaurs knew (26:18 - 26:21)
the answer to the dinosaur question and (26:19 - 26:22)
i (26:21 - 26:25)
i'm salty about it still still it's been (26:22 - 26:27)
like what a year and a half (26:25 - 26:30)
something like that god this is like the (26:27 - 26:31)
movie the grudge (26:30 - 26:33)
although brontosaurus is a real dinosaur (26:31 - 26:36)
i think you're thinking of the wrong one (26:33 - 26:38)
brachiosaurus or whatever i don't know (26:36 - 26:40)
the one with the long neck i don't bro (26:38 - 26:41)
that's brontosaurus is the one with the (26:40 - 26:43)
long neck it's a real dinosaur i'm (26:41 - 26:45)
looking it up right now (26:43 - 26:47)
because i was like i'm trying to find (26:45 - 26:48)
what the real name is and then it's like (26:47 - 26:49)
it's (26:48 - 26:51)
it's the long neck dinosaur jurassic (26:49 - 26:52)
park that's not a real dinosaur (26:51 - 26:55)
it is a real dinosaur i'm literally (26:52 - 26:58)
looking at it right now (26:55 - 26:58)
greg verified dinosaur knowledge i gotta (26:59 - 27:04)
finish this article (27:01 - 27:04)
uh okay so (27:04 - 27:11)
here is the answer it was (27:07 - 27:13)
believed to not be real and then they (27:11 - 27:16)
have now since proven that it was right (27:13 - 27:18)
exactly wait what the fried thesaurus is (27:16 - 27:19)
back (27:18 - 27:21)
is officially reclaimed that's what it (27:19 - 27:23)
is no no no pluto is never going to be a (27:21 - 27:24)
planet again (27:23 - 27:27)
keeps flipping no it doesn't wait so (27:24 - 27:29)
when did mystery murder party come out (27:27 - 27:32)
a long time ago that was like 2013 or (27:29 - 27:34)
something right yeah and it wasn't (27:32 - 27:37)
until 2015 that it was brought back as (27:34 - 27:39)
being a dinosaur (27:37 - 27:41)
interesting i'd be curious what the (27:39 - 27:44)
other three answers were (27:41 - 27:44)
wow i don't remember the other three (27:45 - 27:47)
differences we found between the (27:46 - 27:48)
brontosaurus (27:47 - 27:51)
and the apatosaurosaurus at least as (27:48 - 27:53)
numerous as the ones (27:51 - 27:56)
between other closely related dinosaurs (27:53 - 27:58)
uh and much more than you would normally (27:56 - 28:01)
find in a species so they thought it was (27:58 - 28:03)
just a variant but now they have seen (28:01 - 28:04)
that there is (28:03 - 28:06)
enough differences that they can (28:04 - 28:09)
reclassify it as its own brontosaurus (28:06 - 28:12)
this happened late 2015 it was lost in (28:09 - 28:14)
the news (28:12 - 28:16)
okay but when did they decide it wasn't (28:14 - 28:17)
a dinosaur (28:16 - 28:19)
but the thunder lose the thunder lizard (28:17 - 28:21)
has been proven to be species in its own (28:19 - 28:21)
right (28:21 - 28:23)
oh this is the problem steve hates the (28:21 - 28:25)
word so (28:23 - 28:25)
pluto was declassified in 2006 and (28:27 - 28:32)
it looks like rinosaurus was (28:30 - 28:33)
declassified in 2006 (28:32 - 28:36)
i'm trying to fight okay exact date so (28:33 - 28:38)
it took him a while to prove that the (28:36 - 28:40)
brontosaurus is real so guess what salty (28:38 - 28:41)
man (28:40 - 28:43)
you can no longer be salty because time (28:41 - 28:44)
has proven you (28:43 - 28:47)
wrong yet again hey i was the only one (28:44 - 28:50)
in the room that got that question right (28:47 - 28:50)
i could only imagine what the other (28:51 - 28:55)
people guessed (28:52 - 28:56)
that's why i'm curious what the other (28:55 - 28:58)
three dinosaurs where i don't remember (28:56 - 29:02)
the dinosaurs or pokemon (28:58 - 29:05)
the museum the pokemon fossil museum (29:02 - 29:07)

they need to get out we got plenty of (29:33 - 29:37)
time to (29:36 - 29:40)

i am sure these museums will carry (29:40 - 29:45)
pikachu merch with pikachu wearing (29:42 - 29:51)
a hard hat or something and a pickaxe (29:45 - 29:54)

housekeeping out of the way uh there was (34:09 - 34:12)
a (34:11 - 34:15)
max raid battle weekend in pokemon sword (34:12 - 34:17)
and shield this weekend (34:15 - 34:22)
uh it was (34:17 - 34:22)
yeah of course penguins are fantastic (34:25 - 34:32)
world penguin day is april 25th that's (34:29 - 34:32)
what they say here (34:32 - 34:35)
nobody loves penguins as much as i do i (34:32 - 34:37)
wanted a penguin as a kid (34:35 - 34:40)
i had a whole plan for how i would keep (34:37 - 34:42)
a penguin as a pet because i (34:40 - 34:43)
fundamentally didn't understand how (34:42 - 34:46)
penguins worked but i had a plan like (34:43 - 34:48)
there's a bathroom i could take over i (34:46 - 34:49)
had a whole thing (34:48 - 34:51)
i read a bunch of penguin books my (34:49 - 34:53)
parents were very against the idea (34:51 - 34:56)
i was a penguin as a kid wow (34:53 - 34:59)
you ever hear of chilly willy if not (34:56 - 35:00)
look it up (34:59 - 35:04)
kids because that was me the penguin (35:00 - 35:08)
yes that was me that was me (35:04 - 35:11)
he's chilly (35:08 - 35:11)
i did i got a shiny penguin (35:11 - 35:18)
i got congrats i already had a shiny (35:16 - 35:19)
penguin but i got another one (35:18 - 35:23)
you had two wow i was expecting you to (35:19 - 35:23)
say (35:23 - 35:25)
what you always say is i did a bunch and (35:23 - 35:27)
i didn't get any (35:25 - 35:30)
well now you can evolve one of them uh a (35:27 - 35:31)
wonderful (35:30 - 35:34)
listener who is in a time zone far in (35:31 - 35:35)
the future (35:34 - 35:39)
helped me get the first one and then (35:35 - 35:39)
friday night i think it was friday (35:40 - 35:47)
i randomly joined one on the y-com (35:43 - 35:52)
and it was shiny i'm like nice (35:47 - 35:54)
was the whole cash percentages and (35:52 - 35:55)
everything the same where it's like if (35:54 - 35:57)
you were hosting the raid you had you (35:55 - 35:57)
were (35:57 - 35:59)
guaranteed but if you weren't it was (35:57 - 36:01)
like 10 or something (35:59 - 36:03)
well i think with ice cube because it's (36:01 - 36:05)
based off species catch rate i think ice (36:03 - 36:06)
cube is like (36:05 - 36:09)
22 or something (36:06 - 36:12)
but if you ultra ball it's like 44 and (36:09 - 36:14)
then if you repeat ball it's pretty much (36:12 - 36:14)
100 (36:14 - 36:16)
close to 100 i mean it's all repeat (36:14 - 36:18)
balls what like times five i think times (36:16 - 36:21)
four times five (36:18 - 36:21)
so i repeat bald mine because i (36:21 - 36:28)
was a guest (36:25 - 36:28)
yeah i that that existed i as much as i (36:28 - 36:34)
like these raid weekends (36:31 - 36:36)
the same thing i'm a broken record they (36:34 - 36:38)
do a really bad job at promoting them (36:36 - 36:40)
and letting people know and (36:38 - 36:44)
the lack of heads up is a bummer and (36:40 - 36:47)
the thing they always do there was a (36:44 - 36:49)
pogo event this past weekend (36:47 - 36:51)
there was this event there was the (36:49 - 36:53)
players cup what was last weekend (36:51 - 36:56)
oh nothing like they (36:53 - 36:59)

true friendship that would be the front (37:52 - 37:56)
of our shop (37:54 - 38:00)
and then uh we took a risk (37:56 - 38:04)
and we went and ate out of five guys (38:00 - 38:06)
indoors (38:04 - 38:06)
a surreal experience because it's been (38:07 - 38:13)
literally a year since i've eaten inside (38:10 - 38:13)
a restaurant (38:13 - 38:16)

it was one of those catch challenges (38:54 - 38:59)

000 xp which you know i'm it's a lot (41:16 - 41:22)
curious of all the people that were (41:21 - 41:24)
complaining about not being level 40 (41:22 - 41:25)
from you (41:24 - 41:27)
went the extra mile to do this because (41:25 - 41:29)
it was pretty easy a lot of xp for (41:27 - 41:33)
little to no work um (41:29 - 41:36)
i found a a shiny alolan exeggutor that (41:33 - 41:37)
was pretty cool (41:36 - 41:38)
nice uh i i checked like the self-rodent (41:37 - 41:40)
stuff i don't think uh (41:38 - 41:42)
any grass-type pokemon was boosted shiny (41:40 - 41:43)
odds (41:42 - 41:45)
uh there was three times catch bonus so (41:43 - 41:47)
if you were playing during the hour (41:45 - 41:49)
obviously having a lucky egg wouldn't (41:47 - 41:51)
increase that and then there (41:49 - 41:53)
they increased trade distance by 40 (41:51 - 41:55)
kilometers (41:53 - 41:56)
which i don't know what that is in (41:55 - 41:58)
american (41:56 - 42:01)
and then your incense lasted your lures (41:58 - 42:02)
lasted (42:01 - 42:04)
and you had a higher chance of getting (42:02 - 42:06)
lucky pokemon if you completed trade (42:04 - 42:07)
with a friend (42:06 - 42:12)
24 miles i don't have any friends (42:07 - 42:15)
so i had a pretty good time though i (42:12 - 42:18)
played 90 minutes of the three hours (42:15 - 42:21)
and i walked like four miles (42:18 - 42:24)
so that was pretty good (42:21 - 42:28)
it was an alright event prior to this (42:24 - 42:29)
event although we haven't talked about (42:28 - 42:31)
we didn't talk about this last week (42:29 - 42:35)
but like the two days before this event (42:31 - 42:37)
the lucky egg stuff was like slightly (42:35 - 42:39)
broken (42:37 - 42:41)
where is if you use the lucky egg and (42:39 - 42:42)
you opened a (42:41 - 42:44)
present from a friend to get the (42:42 - 42:46)
friendship xp (42:44 - 42:49)
it wasn't working for some people not (42:46 - 42:50)
all people (42:49 - 42:53)
it seemed to be like (42:50 - 42:56)
not widespread (42:53 - 42:56)
but obviously the people it happened to (42:56 - 43:00)
they were very (42:59 - 43:03)
vocal and angry (43:00 - 43:03)
so they were very loud of course and i (43:03 - 43:07)
get it right you know you're supposed to (43:05 - 43:08)
get a hundred thousand x (43:07 - 43:10)
200 000 xp you only get 100 000 xp it (43:08 - 43:11)
was you know it cost (43:10 - 43:13)
80 cents to turn on a lucky egg totally (43:11 - 43:15)
understand the complaints (43:13 - 43:16)
the other thing though is team rocket (43:15 - 43:18)
was missing for two weeks i don't know (43:16 - 43:18)
if you (43:18 - 43:21)
all noticed yes i was supposed to be (43:18 - 43:22)
fighting (43:21 - 43:25)
giovanni and i'm like scared of me (43:22 - 43:27)
there's no balloon (43:25 - 43:30)
he's so too afraid of what i can do (43:27 - 43:34)
right before friendship day uh they (43:30 - 43:36)
were they fixed the lucky egg so that's (43:34 - 43:37)
working now again (43:36 - 43:40)
and then team rocket's back so i'm not (43:37 - 43:42)
sure what (43:40 - 43:45)
weird issue broke (43:42 - 43:47)
team rocket i don't even know why team (43:45 - 43:48)
rocket broke in the first (43:47 - 43:50)
place like i don't know what went wrong (43:48 - 43:53)
i just remember them getting pulled (43:50 - 43:56)
they were too annoying (43:53 - 43:56)
not wrong uh but niantic fixed both (43:56 - 44:00)
before this event so that was (43:59 - 44:05)
good but again i don't think (44:00 - 44:06)
i don't think niantic would ever say why (44:05 - 44:08)
it broke or even maybe they (44:06 - 44:11)
even know what caused it or if the (44:08 - 44:11)
pokemon (44:11 - 44:13)
like the pokemon company is very good at (44:11 - 44:16)
being like there's an issue we just (44:13 - 44:17)
keep on pushing forward we're not going (44:16 - 44:20)
to acknowledge that (44:17 - 44:20)
although i think in like harry potter (44:22 - 44:26)
wizards unite (44:24 - 44:29)
i feel like they can't i don't know i (44:26 - 44:29)
thought (44:29 - 44:31)
i felt like rocket balloons left there (44:29 - 44:33)
too no i felt like there was an (44:31 - 44:37)
issue like that rocket (44:33 - 44:37)
i thought i remember reading there was (44:39 - 44:42)
an issue in harry potter and they kind (44:41 - 44:44)
of explained what went wrong and kind of (44:42 - 44:45)
elaborated on it but (44:44 - 44:47)
they will never do that with pokemon go (44:45 - 44:48)
no i mean somebody leaned on the button (44:47 - 44:52)
that turned off the shinies (44:48 - 44:54)
and turned off from team rocket because (44:52 - 44:56)
it is just a button (44:54 - 44:58)
at this point they have that fine of (44:56 - 44:59)
control (44:58 - 45:03)
it's it's interesting to think about you (44:59 - 45:04)
know this game being almost five years (45:03 - 45:07)
old and being like i i know this from (45:04 - 45:09)
working on websites at least which a (45:07 - 45:11)
website is probably less complicated (45:09 - 45:12)
than a mobile app that exists between (45:11 - 45:14)
two platforms on various phones and (45:12 - 45:16)
various os's (45:14 - 45:17)
i don't know how many versions of (45:16 - 45:19)
android it's running on (45:17 - 45:21)
or how many versions of ios or how (45:19 - 45:22)
android (45:21 - 45:24)
works on a google phone versus samsung (45:22 - 45:25)
versus (45:24 - 45:28)
how it huawei huawei is that what that (45:25 - 45:29)
one is (45:28 - 45:33)
what uh what the (45:29 - 45:33)
but when i was fixing websites when i (45:38 - 45:42)
had a real job back in the day (45:40 - 45:44)
and you would go in and you would see (45:42 - 45:45)
like (45:44 - 45:47)
six years of a website and how (45:45 - 45:49)
everything was like band-aid on top of (45:47 - 45:50)
each other (45:49 - 45:52)
and and the boss would be like i want (45:50 - 45:54)
you to do this and you're like (45:52 - 45:56)
uh but if we do this this will break (45:54 - 45:58)
this will break this will break and this (45:56 - 45:58)
will break (45:58 - 46:02)
um so we're gonna have to like fix those (45:58 - 46:05)
first before we do what you wanted to do (46:02 - 46:08)
i'm curious of how much at this point (46:05 - 46:10)
pokemon go is held together with (46:08 - 46:12)
band-aids it's band-aids all the way (46:10 - 46:13)
down (46:12 - 46:17)
no oh (46:13 - 46:17)
had rigorous control over their code (46:17 - 46:22)
base (46:20 - 46:25)
said no one ever i just said it (46:22 - 46:27)
[Laughter] (46:25 - 46:29)
they literally had one person working on (46:27 - 46:31)
the code and then they exploded and now (46:29 - 46:32)
there's like yeah that's a team of 50 (46:31 - 46:33)
who just keeps (46:32 - 46:37)
adding code on top of code like i'm like (46:33 - 46:40)
they added the same [ __ ] and killed team (46:37 - 46:41)
rocket the game (46:40 - 46:44)
shipped in a working state (46:41 - 46:44)
that's debatable because it crashed a (46:45 - 46:48)
lot five years ago (46:46 - 46:52)
yeah five years ago and they (46:48 - 46:54)
had server problems so i don't think (46:52 - 46:56)
that was necessarily the game it was you (46:54 - 46:57)
know connecting the server and that's (46:56 - 46:57)
right (46:57 - 47:00)
it was the server's fault and then they (46:57 - 47:01)
they that (47:00 - 47:04)
the tip is rapidly dropping server (47:01 - 47:07)
and then they had to they had to hire a (47:04 - 47:09)
bunch of people (47:07 - 47:09)
and at least with the pandemic they had (47:09 - 47:13)
to pivot (47:12 - 47:16)
and make remote raid passes work and (47:13 - 47:18)
squeeze out well who knows how long the (47:16 - 47:19)
evolution was in (47:18 - 47:23)
that stuff or hey whatever happened to (47:19 - 47:24)
those sponsored balloons do we talk (47:23 - 47:25)
about those (47:24 - 47:28)
i see them every once in a while but all (47:25 - 47:29)
balloons disappeared (47:28 - 47:31)
during yeah yeah i haven't seen those (47:29 - 47:33)
sponsored balloons since team rocket (47:31 - 47:34)
came back (47:33 - 47:37)
i this is not defending niantic but i am (47:34 - 47:38)
sure their app is (47:37 - 47:40)
held together with band-aids at this (47:38 - 47:42)
point everything is held together (47:40 - 47:44)
right this podcast is held together with (47:42 - 47:46)
band-aids (47:44 - 47:49)
yeah so i'd be curiou i'd be curious if (47:46 - 47:53)
people would be okay well no one would (47:49 - 47:55)
be okay with anything like if niantic (47:53 - 47:56)
came out and said (47:55 - 47:58)
we're not adding any new features for (47:56 - 47:59)
three months (47:58 - 48:02)
but we are going to work on making the (47:59 - 48:04)
app more stable (48:02 - 48:07)
i think hardcore players i don't know (48:04 - 48:08)
though (48:07 - 48:09)
like i feel like hardcore players would (48:08 - 48:11)
be like yes i would want a more stable (48:09 - 48:11)
app (48:11 - 48:13)
whereas like casual players would be (48:11 - 48:15)
like well the game is like you're not (48:13 - 48:16)
adding anything new (48:15 - 48:17)
the game is boring i'm going to leave (48:16 - 48:19)
the majority of people are (48:17 - 48:21)
going to be like retain retain my (48:19 - 48:22)
interest or (48:21 - 48:24)
you're lost me forever i would just like (48:22 - 48:26)
them to fix (48:24 - 48:29)
the fact that at least (48:26 - 48:32)
55 of the time when i attempt to bring (48:29 - 48:34)
my buddy into the real world and feed it (48:32 - 48:35)
berries (48:34 - 48:37)
it just sits there it spins for five (48:35 - 48:39)
minutes and then says network air (48:37 - 48:40)
network air network air (48:39 - 48:42)
until i close the app you need to get it (48:40 - 48:44)
again the fiber (48:42 - 48:47)
internet is the problem is your butt is (48:44 - 48:49)
your buddy a spinda (48:47 - 48:53)
no oh okay my buddy is a shiny butt dude (48:49 - 48:54)
right now (48:53 - 48:57)
um i have never had anybody issues (48:54 - 49:01)
i have buddy issues all the time (48:57 - 49:03)
interesting instantly what i what oh (49:01 - 49:04)
you're (49:03 - 49:08)
five five the new whatever 14.15 or (49:04 - 49:09)
whatever (49:08 - 49:11)
whatever it is i don't know yeah i've (49:09 - 49:13)
never had buddy issues (49:11 - 49:15)
it's just they have low quality internet (49:13 - 49:17)
on that part of minneapolis (49:15 - 49:20)
so that's you're low quality internet (49:17 - 49:23)
i've got fiber sir i have it when i'm (49:20 - 49:25)
using this is the only issue i have (49:23 - 49:26)
frequently and it's not even that (49:25 - 49:27)
frequent it's like (49:26 - 49:30)
once every five hours if i'm hardcore (49:27 - 49:31)
playing go (49:30 - 49:35)
is when i have the pokeball plus active (49:31 - 49:37)
it will continue working but i can't (49:35 - 49:39)
spin my character (49:37 - 49:41)
my character will still walk the pokemon (49:39 - 49:43)
will still spawn in (49:41 - 49:44)
the pokeball plus will still work but my (49:43 - 49:47)
character will just like i can't move (49:44 - 49:47)
the (49:47 - 49:49)
camera i get that everyone will do i'm (49:47 - 49:53)
on 14.4.2 (49:49 - 49:58)
oh i don't know if that's the latest (49:53 - 50:01)
uh it says my software is up to date so (49:58 - 50:03)
apple thinks so yeah that's what i'm on (50:01 - 50:07)
to 14.4.2 (50:03 - 50:07)
yeah i've never had the badoo issue (50:07 - 50:10)
maybe it's just badou (50:09 - 50:13)
it's not it happens on all of them i had (50:10 - 50:14)
a mammal swine issue (50:13 - 50:18)
i had wait have they all been shiny (50:14 - 50:18)
mama's wine isn't shiny gardevoir was (50:18 - 50:26)
is and badu is and roserade (50:22 - 50:29)
is yeah but i think (50:26 - 50:31)
yeah i think the the the question of (50:29 - 50:32)
like would (50:31 - 50:34)
would most people be okay with niantic (50:32 - 50:37)
not adding new stuff and instead of just (50:34 - 50:40)
making the game more stable i think the (50:37 - 50:40)
answer is (50:40 - 50:43)
time was short i think it was a month (50:40 - 50:45)
yes i think if it was like it's going to (50:43 - 50:47)
take three months to do this (50:45 - 50:49)
i think you would lose casual players (50:47 - 50:51)
you have to do something spectacular to (50:49 - 50:56)
bring them back (50:51 - 50:56)
i'd be i i kind of wish i played ingress (50:57 - 51:01)
because they did that whole revamp of (51:00 - 51:03)
ingress (51:01 - 51:06)
at that time no i'm not gonna play (51:03 - 51:07)
ingress now (51:06 - 51:08)
i'm just saying that you wish that you (51:07 - 51:10)
played ingress this is within your (51:08 - 51:13)
control you can obtain this way (51:10 - 51:15)
it's not difficult no no no i was saying (51:13 - 51:16)
i wish i knew (51:15 - 51:19)
like i wish i played ingress and saw the (51:16 - 51:20)
progression of that game (51:19 - 51:23)
to the point where they revamped it and (51:20 - 51:24)
to see what that (51:23 - 51:27)
was what was it greg i don't remember (51:24 - 51:29)
old ingress i don't remember the revamp (51:27 - 51:30)
i do (51:29 - 51:32)
know that people were very excited and (51:30 - 51:35)
pretty positive about the revamp (51:32 - 51:38)
uh so i'm trying to remember old ingress (51:35 - 51:39)
i think when it first launched i had (51:38 - 51:40)
three teams (51:39 - 51:43)
and then the revamp cut it down to two (51:40 - 51:44)
uh (51:43 - 51:48)
oh ingress went from like (51:44 - 51:48)
i tried (51:48 - 51:54)
maybe i'm thinking of a different game (51:52 - 51:55)
uh (51:54 - 51:58)
but yeah it was not very fun before and (51:55 - 52:00)
then they (51:58 - 52:02)
when they revamped it it was a lot more (52:00 - 52:04)
control you could do a lot more things (52:02 - 52:04)
it was (52:04 - 52:07)
easier to do a bunch of stuff uh because (52:04 - 52:08)
i played it (52:07 - 52:11)
sort of before and then after the revamp (52:08 - 52:13)
it was a lot more fun and then go came (52:11 - 52:15)
in and i was like buying chris (52:13 - 52:18)
going to pokemon go (52:15 - 52:20)
it was a pretty big change but they had (52:18 - 52:21)
lost (52:20 - 52:23)
they had lost so many people playing (52:21 - 52:24)
ingress that (52:23 - 52:26)
i don't think it hurt them to revamp it (52:24 - 52:28)
because they needed to do something (52:26 - 52:29)
yeah i don't think they would ever do (52:28 - 52:31)
like pokemon go too but i feel like (52:29 - 52:34)
there would be a point (52:31 - 52:34)
where they were like we're going to (52:34 - 52:38)
overhaul the whole app (52:36 - 52:39)
maybe that would be like when they catch (52:38 - 52:41)
up with pokemon and they're like oh gosh (52:39 - 52:42)
we need something (52:41 - 52:48)
we need something else to do here (52:42 - 52:48)
and they just recently updated ingress (52:51 - 52:55)
to be more like pokemon go (52:53 - 52:57)
like in the last three years maybe there (52:55 - 52:59)
was two revamps of ingress because i (52:57 - 53:00)
swear there was a revamp like (52:59 - 53:02)
two years ago yeah there was one two (53:00 - 53:06)
years ago and i think there was one (53:02 - 53:08)
wait when did the ingress come out 20 (53:06 - 53:10)
chris was (53:08 - 53:15)
2012. i think so (53:10 - 53:19)
so i think there was one in (53:15 - 53:19)
2014 2015 as they were getting ready to (53:19 - 53:22)
do (53:22 - 53:25)
go and then there's been another one in (53:22 - 53:26)
2018. (53:25 - 53:29)
that sounds right uh to make up for the (53:26 - 53:31)
team rocket which was away (53:29 - 53:34)
shadow zapdos will return when you (53:31 - 53:35)
defeat (53:34 - 53:39)
giovanni between june 1st (53:35 - 53:42)
through june 17th this is june (53:39 - 53:44)
yeah that's a long time away wait but (53:42 - 53:45)
okay (53:44 - 53:47)
they came back and i defeated giovanni (53:45 - 53:51)
and i got mine was the shadow zapdos (53:47 - 53:57)
like today like yesterday oh (53:51 - 53:59)
they're going to give it to you again (53:57 - 54:00)
because they've got to follow the old (53:59 - 54:01)
rotation that they had planned i don't (54:00 - 54:05)
even know how you get giovanni (54:01 - 54:07)
outside of these events can you you're (54:05 - 54:08)
supposed to (54:07 - 54:11)
you're supposed to defeat so (54:08 - 54:14)
in the game there was a spot where it (54:11 - 54:16)
would say like team rocket trouble (54:14 - 54:17)
whatever (54:16 - 54:19)
and it would always remember how many (54:17 - 54:20)
leaders you beat (54:19 - 54:24)
so when you beat arlo cliff and sierra (54:20 - 54:28)
it would then give you the giovanni (54:24 - 54:31)
radar to find giovanni but when the (54:28 - 54:32)
pandemic started (54:31 - 54:34)
they disabled that because that was (54:32 - 54:37)
supposed to reset once a month (54:34 - 54:40)
okay that's why um so you can now only (54:37 - 54:42)
get giovanni when you have giovanni (54:40 - 54:43)
radar (54:42 - 54:44)
and they've been doing these special (54:43 - 54:48)
events where like giovanni's back (54:44 - 54:49)
but they're like giving you the radar (54:48 - 54:52)
for completing something hmm (54:49 - 54:55)
so you probably ha so i bet you had the (54:52 - 54:57)
giovanni radar (54:55 - 54:59)
obviously yes you used it but they're (54:57 - 55:01)
saying we're not giving any giovanni (54:59 - 55:02)
radars out (55:01 - 55:04)
once june comes we'll be giving the (55:02 - 55:06)
giovanni radar out and if you (55:04 - 55:09)
missed it um the zapdos here's your (55:06 - 55:11)
opportunity to get it yeah i gotta get (55:09 - 55:11)
it (55:11 - 55:14)
that this makes sense now i had to walk (55:11 - 55:16)
through that slowly (55:14 - 55:21)
all right speaking of walking pokemon (55:16 - 55:24)
question of the week (55:21 - 55:27)
we're there already dude it's the 25th (55:24 - 55:29)
anniversary (55:27 - 55:31)
we only have some we can only put so (55:29 - 55:33)
much exciting 25th news in an episode (55:31 - 55:36)
is it snowing out is it (55:33 - 55:40)
no it can't be snowing here (55:36 - 55:45)
well uh all right what's the question of (55:40 - 55:48)
the week what's the question of (55:45 - 55:52)
the week (55:48 - 55:52)
that's a good one i have to look to see (55:53 - 55:58)
if it's snowing hold on (55:55 - 56:04)
while steve looks i have the questions (55:58 - 56:04)
maybe that's rain i i could have been (56:05 - 56:09)
mistaken it is not snowing up here (56:07 - 56:12)
is it raining no it's not (56:09 - 56:14)
all right we can do the we can do two (56:12 - 56:16)
questions here first one is from patrick (56:14 - 56:17)
from our slack (56:16 - 56:19)
from from last night's stream if (56:17 - 56:21)
instagram was a thing in the pokemon (56:19 - 56:23)
world what character would have the most (56:21 - 56:26)
followers (56:23 - 56:26)
um (56:29 - 56:33)
oh are we talking like people not (56:31 - 56:34)
pokemon yeah (56:33 - 56:37)
why pokemon other than rotom has access (56:34 - 56:41)
to a camera and can use that (56:37 - 56:41)
look pikachu's on cameras yeah people (56:42 - 56:46)
will take pictures of (56:45 - 56:49)
pikachu so picture printers not on (56:46 - 56:50)
here's the thing (56:49 - 56:52)
ash has an instagram and he has (56:50 - 56:54)
pikachu's instagram (56:52 - 56:57)
where so ash poses his boring life and (56:54 - 56:58)
he's got like (56:57 - 57:01)
five followers but his pikachu page that (56:58 - 57:02)
he runs (57:01 - 57:04)
has a lot so in that way ash's pikachu (57:02 - 57:05)
probably has a lot of (57:04 - 57:08)
followers second is rihanna fascist (57:05 - 57:09)
pikachu (57:08 - 57:11)
is significantly more popular than ash (57:09 - 57:14)
yes way more popular ash has like (57:11 - 57:18)
ash on average gets five likes for his (57:14 - 57:20)
brunch shots this is what i'm eating (57:18 - 57:22)
today for brunch (57:20 - 57:25)
and pikachu falls off a log and there's (57:22 - 57:27)
like a million likes (57:25 - 57:29)
and it kind of bugs ash you know that (57:27 - 57:32)
eats him up inside but he gets a lot of (57:29 - 57:32)
really good (57:32 - 57:36)
deals through pikachu so he can't really (57:32 - 57:38)
stop doing it i mean his life is now (57:36 - 57:40)
taking pictures of pikachu the free (57:38 - 57:41)
pikachu food (57:40 - 57:44)
treats toys thank you but he resents (57:41 - 57:45)
pikachu at this (57:44 - 57:48)
i don't think ash would be that high on (57:45 - 57:49)
an (57:48 - 57:52)
instagram thing he wouldn't no pikachu (57:49 - 57:53)
is pikachu (57:52 - 57:56)
is ash's pikachu the (57:53 - 57:59)
pikachu in the overall pokemon world i (57:56 - 58:00)
would okay so hold on (57:59 - 58:04)
okay if we're just talking pokemon okay (58:00 - 58:06)
pikachu would be number one and like (58:04 - 58:07)
mewtwo and charizard and (58:06 - 58:09)
great ninja would probably be like top (58:07 - 58:11)
five because at that point you're just (58:09 - 58:12)
ranking like (58:11 - 58:14)
popular pokemon yeah no no no no no (58:12 - 58:15)
that's not (58:14 - 58:18)
do you like have you ever used instagram (58:15 - 58:18)
yes (58:18 - 58:21)
i have but the thing is you don't do you (58:18 - 58:21)
because like (58:21 - 58:23)
right it's like i have i have my (58:21 - 58:26)
instagram wash in the sink (58:23 - 58:29)
right i have my finsta which you all (58:26 - 58:31)
don't know (58:29 - 58:32)
and if you don't know what a finsta is (58:31 - 58:34)
i'm you're too old (58:32 - 58:38)
then i actually manage the instagram (58:34 - 58:42)
for scrapple now wash in the sink has (58:38 - 58:44)
like 450 instagram followers (58:42 - 58:48)
scrapple has 250 000 instagram followers (58:44 - 58:51)
because people enjoy evil cats yes (58:48 - 58:54)
so ash has like five followers yes but (58:51 - 58:55)
ash's (58:54 - 58:58)
pikachu yes has a lot (58:55 - 59:01)
giovanni and youtube (58:58 - 59:01)
is rivaling the kardashians yes it is i (59:02 - 59:06)
don't think ash's pikachu (59:05 - 59:09)
would have a bunch of followers because (59:06 - 59:09)
uh (59:09 - 59:11)
because there are other more famous (59:09 - 59:13)
pikachus in the pokemon world (59:11 - 59:17)
there are not master chewster (59:13 - 59:22)
who the movie star pikachu from alola (59:17 - 59:25)
yeah he would have more followers than (59:22 - 59:28)
ash's pikachu he's a famous pikachu (59:25 - 59:33)
no no ashley bring (59:28 - 59:33)
show me show me where masterchester (59:36 - 59:39)
exists (59:38 - 59:41)
what do you mean or massachusetts show (59:39 - 59:42)

show me his instagram page (59:42 - 59:50)
you know misty is out there on tick tock (59:47 - 59:51)
she's doing all the dancing (59:50 - 59:54)
we can't we will not take any creative (59:51 - 59:56)
liberty with this question and start (59:54 - 60:00)
talking about other social medias (59:56 - 60:03)
not yeah we will i i think greg is right (60:00 - 60:04)
as (60:03 - 60:07)
ry ryhan right very high (60:04 - 60:10)
yes probably nessa because she's in (60:07 - 60:11)
fashion (60:10 - 60:14)
she's a model she's a model no but uh (60:11 - 60:18)
uh alyssa uh yeah uh (60:14 - 60:21)
elisa elisa yeah she would be pretty (60:18 - 60:22)
absolutely does (60:21 - 60:26)
iris iris probably is (60:22 - 60:27)
up there because people are just (60:26 - 60:29)
fascinated how this kid became champion (60:27 - 60:31)
she has a lot of hate comments though (60:29 - 60:34)
but she doesn't want to get her down (60:31 - 60:38)
uh we know bryson mann (60:34 - 60:41)
is constantly upset at how how (60:38 - 60:43)
many followers he doesn't have bryce and (60:41 - 60:45)
man try hard on instagram yeah (60:43 - 60:50)
oh milo is like uh (60:45 - 60:53)
our our friend house plant daddy yeah (60:50 - 60:54)
milo (60:53 - 60:57)
milo has a very vivid plant blog (60:54 - 61:00)
milo not not in the top charts though no (60:57 - 61:01)
not very happy braden (61:00 - 61:04)
drayton has a certain followers we'll (61:01 - 61:06)
have to talk about that next week (61:04 - 61:10)
that follows daddy's follows drayden's (61:06 - 61:14)
stuff totally (61:10 - 61:16)
okay but what what what trainers are not (61:14 - 61:17)
using instagram like i don't think (61:16 - 61:19)
lenora's usually (61:17 - 61:22)
lenora is got no time who's the old man (61:19 - 61:25)
in the tree (61:22 - 61:25)
technology person no uh (61:33 - 61:40)
none of the or koga no koga either the (61:37 - 61:42)
cooks don't have it silly and (61:40 - 61:44)
cress and no they the people love (61:42 - 61:46)
they're taking pictures of their food i (61:44 - 61:47)
think of their food (61:46 - 61:49)
but they don't do it themselves they may (61:47 - 61:53)
have an instagram for their restaurant (61:49 - 61:55)
but not for them because nobody cares (61:53 - 61:57)
about them the wall (61:55 - 61:59)
no one cares about whatever they do (61:57 - 62:01)
professor oak and samson oak are (61:59 - 62:06)
on uh clubhouse they're holding forums (62:01 - 62:07)
i'm not supposed to talk about other (62:06 - 62:10)
services (62:07 - 62:10)
all right second question here here is (62:10 - 62:13)
if you had to design (62:12 - 62:15)
one pokemon product for the 25th (62:13 - 62:16)
anniversary of fantasy (62:15 - 62:18)
has a great instagram that was that was (62:16 - 62:20)
from brandon (62:18 - 62:22)
no one likes to design one pokemon (62:20 - 62:24)
product what do you mean i love fantina (62:22 - 62:26)
yeah fantina would have a fantastic (62:24 - 62:29)
instagram be real (62:26 - 62:29)
be real 25th (62:29 - 62:36)
anniversary product (62:33 - 62:39)
product yeah a butter dish they've never (62:36 - 62:40)
done that before (62:39 - 62:43)
a printer that will print out pictures (62:40 - 62:44)
that you can have in your (62:43 - 62:47)
house and it's a small compact printer (62:44 - 62:49)
okay they didn't design that though (62:47 - 62:52)
okay so 25th anniversary i would have an (62:49 - 62:55)
official (62:52 - 62:55)
licensed tabletop rpg they would give (62:55 - 62:58)
the license (62:57 - 63:01)
to somebody and somebody would actually (62:58 - 63:03)
make that (63:01 - 63:03)
and it was an awful game no that was a (63:07 - 63:11)
board game (63:09 - 63:13)
yeah that game was bad though and i own (63:11 - 63:15)
it and i'm not saying a board game i'm (63:13 - 63:17)
saying a table top rpg (63:15 - 63:20)
like dungeons and dragons or (63:17 - 63:23)
star wars (63:20 - 63:23)
is d d popular in japan (63:24 - 63:31)
oh yeah really huge oh okay there's (63:28 - 63:34)
three enemies that were based off of (63:31 - 63:35)
anime (63:34 - 63:36)
that was like a serious question i had (63:35 - 63:38)
no clue yeah uh d is pretty big (63:36 - 63:41)
uh they have like they have to have like (63:38 - 63:42)
the d and d (63:41 - 63:44)
normal like wizards publish publishes (63:42 - 63:46)
like a japanese version of the book (63:44 - 63:46)
right (63:46 - 63:48)
yes okay i mean they publish japanese (63:46 - 63:50)
versions of (63:48 - 63:53)
pretty much everything it is wizards (63:50 - 63:54)
right like wizards is (63:53 - 63:57)
doing it yeah now but when (63:54 - 64:00)
d d first started in the 80s uh it was (63:57 - 64:01)
big in japan (64:00 - 64:04)
and then i got bigger because a group of (64:01 - 64:06)
players mated (64:04 - 64:10)
uh made an anime of their (64:06 - 64:13)
adventure and they call it the record of (64:10 - 64:14)
the lodos war (64:13 - 64:18)
uh and it's been pretty big like (64:14 - 64:21)
i wouldn't say (64:18 - 64:21)
it's like and well dnd just isn't a top (64:21 - 64:27)
fandom i mean it's big but i (64:24 - 64:29)
thought it was pretty big i mean it's (64:27 - 64:32)
it's it ha it's had a resurgence but (64:29 - 64:32)
it's still (64:32 - 64:34)
like there's still a lot of people (64:32 - 64:36)
who've never heard of it (64:34 - 64:39)
um but it's been pretty steady in japan (64:36 - 64:42)
for a very long time (64:39 - 64:42)
and they actually did put out a kids (64:43 - 64:46)
version of an rpg (64:45 - 64:50)
way way back in the day like 2000 2001 (64:46 - 64:52)
pokemon emergency (64:50 - 64:55)
[Music] (64:52 - 64:55)
they were supposed to do like multiple (64:57 - 65:01)
sets but they only did uh yeah they only (64:59 - 65:01)
did one (65:01 - 65:04)
they only did like two i think (65:01 - 65:07)
they only did one as far as i know oh i (65:04 - 65:08)
thought they came out with the second (65:07 - 65:09)
one (65:08 - 65:11)
wasn't there one with like spiro on the (65:09 - 65:12)
cover and then the second one was (65:11 - 65:13)
jigglypuff (65:12 - 65:16)
on the cover uh no because i think it (65:13 - 65:18)
was only pokemon (65:16 - 65:20)
junior adventure game pokemon emergency (65:18 - 65:22)
junior adventure emergency yeah i don't (65:20 - 65:24)
think there's another one (65:22 - 65:27)
i think oh i think in the box (65:24 - 65:30)
yes there's like a pamphlet that shows (65:27 - 65:31)
the second one (65:30 - 65:33)
yes but i don't yeah i think you're (65:31 - 65:35)
right it never happened (65:33 - 65:38)
but they they had like five planned yes (65:35 - 65:40)
and you can go on ebay and you can buy (65:38 - 65:43)
like a box of the emergencies (65:40 - 65:45)
you can get like 20 of them for 50 bucks (65:43 - 65:46)
or something did that come (65:45 - 65:48)
out it had been like 2 000. we should (65:46 - 65:50)
play that greg i (65:48 - 65:52)
actually own it like a sealed copy of it (65:50 - 65:55)
wait is that mythical is coming back (65:52 - 65:57)
don't start rumors we're gonna get a (65:55 - 66:00)
bunch of people tweeting at me (65:57 - 66:05)
pokemon junior adventure game (66:00 - 66:08)
looks like it was 2000 to 2001 somewhere (66:05 - 66:10)
in there (66:08 - 66:12)
yeah we can play that when you move here (66:10 - 66:13)
we'll play it on stream (66:12 - 66:16)
it's it's it's like in the the early (66:13 - 66:18)
2000s they were trying to license (66:16 - 66:20)
everything with pokemon not that they (66:18 - 66:22)
don't do that today well no that's what (66:20 - 66:23)
i was thinking it's like it's really (66:22 - 66:25)
hard to answer this question because (66:23 - 66:29)
what ha pokemon is has merchandise (66:25 - 66:32)
merchandised themselves out as much as (66:29 - 66:34)
almost as much as disney right it's just (66:32 - 66:35)
like there's not (66:34 - 66:38)
a yeah if you're just a toaster they (66:35 - 66:40)
they there's a pikachu toaster that (66:38 - 66:42)
exists like i mean i i was gonna say (66:40 - 66:43)
pokemon sheets but (66:42 - 66:46)
there's probably pokemon yeah pokemon (66:43 - 66:49)
sheets i had them when i was a kid (66:46 - 66:49)
i had star receipts as a kid they've (66:49 - 66:54)
done underwear (66:52 - 66:57)
they've done levi's (66:54 - 66:59)
what other 25th anniversary i would have (66:57 - 67:01)
another watch (66:59 - 67:04)
their watches are (67:01 - 67:04)
are well maybe a pokemon slash (67:05 - 67:11)
you know crossover watch let's go with (67:08 - 67:12)
omega (67:11 - 67:16)
not rolex okay let's let's let's be hip (67:12 - 67:18)
this is what i would want it's very (67:16 - 67:19)
specific (67:18 - 67:22)
but you know how on the apple watch (67:19 - 67:25)
disney licensed the mickey mouse face (67:22 - 67:28)
yeah you do mickey mouse and minnie (67:25 - 67:30)
like a mickey mouse watch is a very (67:28 - 67:32)
classic american watch to have (67:30 - 67:36)
yeah yeah i would want them to like app (67:32 - 67:37)
i don't know how that works i don't know (67:36 - 67:39)
if like disney approached apple or apple (67:37 - 67:40)
approached disney or (67:39 - 67:42)
apple definitely approached yeah (67:40 - 67:43)
absolutely hey can we (67:42 - 67:45)
include mickey mouse a classic watch on (67:43 - 67:46)
our watch faces (67:45 - 67:48)
yeah but it would be cool if you could (67:46 - 67:50)
have pikachu would pikachu's tail (67:48 - 67:53)
move that would be the minute (67:50 - 67:58)
hand well then his arm would do (67:53 - 67:59)
how does mickey mickey is just as too (67:58 - 68:01)
armed (67:59 - 68:03)
but pikachu has very tiny arms yes (68:01 - 68:05)
wouldn't work very well (68:03 - 68:07)
you could have two pikachus the male and (68:05 - 68:08)
the female and then (68:07 - 68:12)
their tails their tails their tails (68:08 - 68:16)

crossing (68:16 - 68:18)
uh what else would i want for 25th (68:19 - 68:26)
god you know would be great is if they (68:22 - 68:27)
had (68:26 - 68:30)
a cd or an album release of (68:27 - 68:34)
pop stars making pokemon songs (68:30 - 68:39)

list of artists maybe even have like (68:46 - 68:50)
some sort of weird virtual concert that (68:48 - 68:53)
would be so cool (68:50 - 68:56)
i felt like i said we got nothing (68:53 - 68:58)
i was gonna say like i'm surprised (68:56 - 68:59)
there's not a mario pikachu crossed over (68:58 - 69:02)
but they did actually do that like (68:59 - 69:05)
four years ago yeah they had pikachu's (69:02 - 69:07)
in little mario outfits (69:05 - 69:08)
oh yeah well it was when they opened the (69:07 - 69:11)
nintendo store (69:08 - 69:11)
which was no that was like two years ago (69:12 - 69:19)
that was like right before the pandemic (69:15 - 69:22)
um i think and then obviously nintendo (69:19 - 69:24)
world is i think now open (69:22 - 69:27)
in japan (69:24 - 69:27)
i have no answers uh (69:28 - 69:34)
pokemon grill i don't think they've done (69:32 - 69:36)
that yet (69:34 - 69:39)
like a weber grill yeah no no (69:36 - 69:42)
like uh was it is it amazon no what (69:39 - 69:45)
rainforest cafe except pokemon cafe (69:42 - 69:46)
pokemon cafe (69:45 - 69:48)
wait they have that in japan yeah they (69:46 - 69:50)
have a pokemon cafe already (69:48 - 69:52)
so they would have a pic they would have (69:50 - 69:53)
to have a pikachu (69:52 - 69:56)
weber grill would they have a snorlax (69:53 - 69:58)
where it's like snorlax's face and you (69:56 - 70:00)
open it up and the mouth opens and you (69:58 - 70:01)
have burgers inside (70:00 - 70:04)
yes i'd buy that what would it not just (70:01 - 70:06)
be a car coal (70:04 - 70:09)
no nobody like no not wherever den (70:06 - 70:11)
wanters are not buying (70:09 - 70:15)
stuff people are not buying a car coal (70:11 - 70:18)
weber grill they're buying a pikachu (70:15 - 70:18)
grill (70:18 - 70:21)
and they're buying a snorlax grill okay (70:18 - 70:22)
what about nobody (70:21 - 70:24)
you could put charizard on it they would (70:22 - 70:25)
have a charizard grill (70:24 - 70:27)
there you go and the tail would go (70:25 - 70:28)
inside (70:27 - 70:32)
and have like the flame by the coals (70:28 - 70:32)
see they need to approach us we could (70:33 - 70:37)
really (70:36 - 70:39)
pump out a great 25th anniversary you (70:37 - 70:40)
know i'm gonna say in the last 15 (70:39 - 70:42)
minutes i don't think we had any good (70:40 - 70:43)
ideas (70:42 - 70:45)
i think they're all bad what was your (70:43 - 70:46)
good idea steve (70:45 - 70:50)
the the apple watch (70:46 - 70:50)
after after i said watch after i said (70:52 - 70:56)
new watch you're like making an apple (70:54 - 70:56)
watch (70:56 - 71:01)
hey how about a pokemon fitbit (70:56 - 71:02)
no because i got an apple watch i don't (71:01 - 71:05)
even know fitbit (71:02 - 71:07)
i don't know looking around my room to (71:05 - 71:09)
see like is there anything in here (71:07 - 71:12)
that i don't need two things uh (71:09 - 71:16)
pokemon wi-fi router uh you know i don't (71:12 - 71:18)
think there's a pokemon wi-fi router i (71:16 - 71:19)
think that is (71:18 - 71:22)
i think that's still an untapped market (71:19 - 71:23)
do they have (71:22 - 71:27)
pokemon usb jump drives (71:23 - 71:32)
um they don't have uh (71:27 - 71:34)
oh they oh like a flash drive they might (71:32 - 71:35)
have a flash drive (71:34 - 71:37)
because i have a star wars one they have (71:35 - 71:39)
the cable dongles you know those things (71:37 - 71:40)
where you um (71:39 - 71:43)
yeah you like put your cable through it (71:40 - 71:44)
and then when you plug it in it looks (71:43 - 71:46)
like pikachu is like biting your phone (71:44 - 71:48)
they have those those are really popular (71:46 - 71:50)
in japan (71:48 - 71:50)
all right speaking of pokemon pokemon of (71:54 - 71:57)
the week speaking of (71:56 - 72:01)
pokemon that's all i'm pretty sure (71:57 - 72:05)
i said at the beginning of pokemon of (72:01 - 72:07)
the week last week i was like (72:05 - 72:10)
once again listen to all the words and (72:07 - 72:11)
yet (72:10 - 72:14)
people didn't (72:11 - 72:14)
uh i think the main thing you know it (72:15 - 72:18)
was (72:18 - 72:20)
i was the focus i i was like let me (72:18 - 72:23)
bring pokemon go up in here we don't (72:20 - 72:24)
talk about pokemon go and pokemon of the (72:23 - 72:25)
week that often (72:24 - 72:28)
i was like we've got a new pokemon that (72:25 - 72:30)
was introduced to pokemon go (72:28 - 72:32)
and you could get it through wild (72:30 - 72:34)
encounters or one star (72:32 - 72:36)
which is also another huge indication to (72:34 - 72:38)
you (72:36 - 72:42)
uh one star raids or for research tasks (72:38 - 72:44)
and then the other thing i went through (72:42 - 72:46)
about how it has (72:44 - 72:49)
the um inability that's uh (72:46 - 72:51)
boost pulse moves which is called mega (72:49 - 72:53)
launcher is the ability i didn't say (72:51 - 72:54)
that as part of the clue (72:53 - 72:56)
but i did say that the pokemon for the (72:54 - 72:57)
week could learn (72:56 - 73:01)
four pulse moves which are boosted by (72:57 - 73:02)
mega launcher (73:01 - 73:06)
um but uh and i then i said another of (73:02 - 73:07)
the new pokemon introduced to go for (73:06 - 73:09)
rivals week (73:07 - 73:11)
of the four of new ones that were (73:09 - 73:12)
introduced uh (73:11 - 73:14)
the the other one can learn six of the (73:12 - 73:16)
seven which would mean like that (73:14 - 73:20)
that it's the evolution of this one (73:16 - 73:22)
and a lot of people just didn't pay (73:20 - 73:24)
attention to that (73:22 - 73:27)
either way who's that (73:24 - 73:30)
pokemon (73:27 - 73:30)
gangler there's only (73:31 - 73:39)
three pokemon that can learn mega (73:35 - 73:41)
launcher or have the mega launcher (73:39 - 73:43)
ability because one of them (73:41 - 73:47)
is clauncher cluncher (73:43 - 73:51)
has one of the best shinies it's just (73:47 - 73:51)
like (73:51 - 73:53)
for everybody who thought it was clawed (73:51 - 73:55)
sir like (73:53 - 73:57)
tip about pokemon go if they're (73:55 - 73:59)
introducing a new pokemon (73:57 - 74:01)
they typically don't introduce the (73:59 - 74:03)
evolution (74:01 - 74:04)
as like it's like you get the new (74:03 - 74:06)
pokemon then you have to evolve it in (74:04 - 74:08)
the game that's how they get you to get (74:06 - 74:09)
the candies (74:08 - 74:11)
i really like the shuffle icon shuffle (74:09 - 74:12)
icon's good (74:11 - 74:14)
it's really good and i like the fact (74:12 - 74:16)
that (74:14 - 74:19)
i like what they did for the shinies (74:16 - 74:19)
blue shrimp versus red shrimp which is a (74:20 - 74:24)
real life thing (74:22 - 74:24)
um (74:27 - 74:32)
any trivia no it's just the trivia is (74:28 - 74:34)
just what it's based off of which is (74:32 - 74:37)
a pistol shrimp yeah yeah it shoots (74:34 - 74:38)
water with its little (74:37 - 74:41)
squirty (74:38 - 74:41)
and claws really wow really (74:41 - 74:48)
uh there is uh uh clawlitz or at least (74:44 - 74:50)
in pokemon snap we saw in the trailer i (74:48 - 74:51)
don't know if there's a cluncher in (74:50 - 74:54)
pokemon snap but that we at least saw (74:51 - 74:57)
a clawlitzer in the game well we only (74:54 - 74:59)
have so many slots for pokemon so (74:57 - 75:02)
only 200 and once one of those pokemon (74:59 - 75:03)
when i first saw it i was like i hate (75:02 - 75:04)
this (75:03 - 75:09)
but over time it's actually really cool (75:04 - 75:11)
like like when i first played x and y i (75:09 - 75:12)
was like this is a very forgettable (75:11 - 75:14)
pokemon (75:12 - 75:17)
it's not for masculine (75:14 - 75:17)
wait does that mean that clawitzer and (75:18 - 75:21)
dragalgi (75:20 - 75:24)
are i'm (75:21 - 75:26)
you are so wrong and go back into the (75:24 - 75:28)
hole you crawled out of okay (75:26 - 75:31)
because uh they are awesome they are (75:28 - 75:33)
virgin exclusives yeah they (75:31 - 75:34)
i guess they would be considered rivals (75:33 - 75:37)
in the sense that like scripp and drag (75:34 - 75:40)
algae or lock to one and then (75:37 - 75:43)
clawlitzer and like i there probably (75:40 - 75:44)
wouldn't be (75:43 - 75:45)
they would probably wouldn't pull a (75:44 - 75:47)
sword and shield and only have one of (75:45 - 75:49)
them (75:47 - 75:50)
they'd probably have both but then keep (75:49 - 75:54)
them version exclusive still yeah (75:50 - 75:54)
the mock kelp pokemon (75:54 - 76:00)
who are you looking at drug algae (75:57 - 76:03)
chicagi is it's it's poison dragon it's (76:00 - 76:04)
just like (76:03 - 76:06)
it was like the answer to the introduced (76:04 - 76:08)
introduction of fairy type (76:06 - 76:11)
i also just like saying script script is (76:08 - 76:15)
cute it's a little cutie scrub's cute (76:11 - 76:18)
dragon launcher is like trek (76:15 - 76:19)
i think the my problem with drag algae (76:18 - 76:20)
it's so thin (76:19 - 76:21)
[Music] (76:20 - 76:25)
but that's how the actual (76:21 - 76:28)
real creature is yeah that's based off (76:25 - 76:29)
of (76:28 - 76:32)
you don't like seahorses no not really (76:29 - 76:33)
they're kind of weird (76:32 - 76:37)
you know like horsey sidra kindra (76:33 - 76:40)
seahorses are so cool (76:37 - 76:42)
i mean so i don't like a lot of things (76:40 - 76:45)
that come from the ocean though (76:42 - 76:48)
i mean so okay look up the leafy sea (76:45 - 76:50)
dragon and you will see what it's based (76:48 - 76:50)
off of (76:50 - 76:52)
no i've seen what it's based off of it's (76:50 - 76:56)
weird-looking it looks like a leaf (76:52 - 76:59)
it's like looking at like a grasshopper (76:56 - 77:00)
i don't want to look at it (76:59 - 77:02)
what's wrong with grasshoppers i don't (77:00 - 77:05)
like looking at bugs (77:02 - 77:05)
i i'm so confused i like i like (77:10 - 77:15)
like i like looking at combi is (77:13 - 77:17)
aesthetically a (77:15 - 77:20)
appealing appeasing because it's in your (77:17 - 77:20)
little (77:20 - 77:22)
boxes that you have to put in yeah yeah (77:20 - 77:23)
but then if i'm on twitter and i'm (77:22 - 77:25)
scrolling and i'm seeing pictures of (77:23 - 77:28)
bees or honeybees or wasps (77:25 - 77:29)
i'm like oh i'm out i don't want to look (77:28 - 77:31)
at i don't want to look at you are you (77:29 - 77:32)
scared (77:31 - 77:35)
they're cute it's too buggy (77:32 - 77:39)
sweetie peas they don't fit into steve's (77:35 - 77:39)
box (77:39 - 77:42)
anything that has any sort of creativity (77:39 - 77:43)
some flow to it (77:42 - 77:46)

you need to be (77:46 - 77:49)
perfectly square clean and in this (77:47 - 77:52)
corner that's right (77:49 - 77:53)
the fact that you have a leak sticking (77:52 - 77:55)
out of your head has been distracting me (77:53 - 77:56)
this entire time (77:55 - 77:58)
i feel like it's falling over more and (77:56 - 78:00)
more yeah (77:58 - 78:01)
it's really it's really gone downhill (78:00 - 78:04)

thank you will be grand thank you and (79:20 - 79:24)
you will be grandfathered into whatever (79:22 - 79:27)
it does so like if your (79:24 - 79:30)
two dollars gets you slack if that (79:27 - 79:32)
reward is technically going away (79:30 - 79:34)
um but everyone who's there they'll get (79:32 - 79:35)
to keep it (79:34 - 79:37)
like we're not gonna suddenly kick you (79:35 - 79:38)

two dollars isn't enough or whatever (79:38 - 79:42)
you're you're safe everyone will be (79:40 - 79:43)

25 to 26 (79:45 - 79:48)
which is not happening but if we were (79:47 - 79:50)

not trying to extort one extra dollar (79:50 - 79:55)
out of you (79:52 - 79:55)
extort is the right word right and it's (79:56 - 79:59)
