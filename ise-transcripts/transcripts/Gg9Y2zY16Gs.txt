[Music] oh what's up everyone welcome to the 460 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello i'm here this is like a weird morning show intro that

only have my fake one that i've made up for everyone just every once in a while chippy i just have to make up an accent so that i can feel like i'm special yes oh yeah we got a loaded episode we got a lot to talk about yeah we do what do we what so okay we don't have a lot of different topics there's no one robbing a walmart no one is nobody wrong walmart buildings for pokemon rush we have two big things we got dates we have dates yeah i guess look that is literally a five-minute conversation no we had something else if i've learned anything about doing the show is we can take something like dates and make it a two-hour conversation i when certain events were scheduled at the same time that other events are scheduled and therefore the implications of the intentions behind the schedulers of the scheduling schedules i'm mad about that hello all right now we've got a three hour program okay and then we have uh go fest that's huge there's lots of cover there uh and then we have uh you know they're updating pokemon home look at how all this news that we have is it gonna make it worth 16 we'll get we'll we'll get to that when we get to that it's called teasing it's what you do on a morning show at the nine o'clock hour we'll get to pokemon home find out if it's raining tomorrow at six o'clock the weather on twos every two minutes we talk about the weather on the twos no weather on the twos means 2 12 22 32 42 52 all of those no every two minutes let's check in with jackal about the weather it's been two minutes has it changed all right let's get sven on here to do the weather oh heck yeah get rid of steve let's bring out sven heck yeah uh let's start with the good stuff i guess which is dates revealed this is the press release dates revealed for pokemon legends arceus brilliant diamond and shining pearl how could you call this the good stuff this is the bad stuff please go forward and i shall provide you with my critique um pokemon brilliant diamond and pokemon shining pearl are faithful remakes of pokemon diamond version and pokemon pearl version they were released in the nintendo ds in 2006 whether or not players have explored the sinnoh region before they can look forward to this great adventure reborn on the nintendo switch the original story has been faithfully reproduced and various game functions have been colorfully revitalized trainers can buzz word city trainers can expect an adventure through the central region that feels both nostalgic and fresh yay fresh nostalgia that's what i live for the pokemon featured on the newly released package designs of pokemon brilliant diamond and pokemon shining pearl are the legendary pokemon dialga and palkia trainers will be able to discover the mysterious connection between dialga or palkia and their sinnoh region during their adventures in pokemon legends arceus the pokemon series takes a bold new direction fusing action with rpg elements the game takes place in the cinahl region of the past long before dinosaurs roamed oh no it's as long before the events of pokemon diamond and pearl version the as the game's protagonist the players will set out and create and complete the region's first pokedex by catching surveying and researching wild pokemon that live there cover art revealed here for the first time depicts mount coronet towering over the expanse of a bygone sinnoh region the setting for the story in pokemon legends arceus all right we'll stop there there's the pokemon home to stuff we'll we'll get to that so they have dates we have uh november 18th for diamond pearl yep correct sorry 19th but i don't know why 18th was on the line uh already messing up the dates they gave us literally little news and i already messed it up november 19th for brilliant diamond shining pearl and then legends of arceus will be january 28th 2020. they did say early 20 sorry 2022. uh they did say early 2022 for arceus and they said holiday for diamond and pearl so there is the i think a shocker for a lot of people which are these two dates are pretty close together we're going to put that on the back burner and talk about we're going to talk about that that was my front burner right there yeah that is the only burner that is the only fight i think before okay before we talk about the the elephant in the room which these dates are very close together we can talk about the lack not true if 2020 taught us anything months can feel like years the the lack of the elephant is they just gave us dates and cover art and no trailer and no new information and no anything else which is i'm not mad about it like i'm not upset i'm not like oh why didn't we like it's just it's just weird i don't know that it's that weird how much more is there to say about faithful rebates there's an e3 coming they have to save some things in the pot it could it could be because they were lacking other e3 news they were gonna be like well we gotta we gotta pat it out with some pokemon stuff because normally normally patterns have been broken patterns normally we get the pokemon stuff a little bit before e3 and then we normally get like a treehouse thing of like okay let's play yeah but the treehouse has been closed down like okay so even if even if the argument is well e3 is around the corner yeah why why announce within the why just why wait why not just wait two weeks i don't understand because e3 is in like two weeks is it i thought it was like three whatever well i mean they they don't want to get overwhelmed by the introduction of the switch pro yeah oh my gosh they don't want to get like they don't want to they want to pull focus from yeah from pokken 4 and the new switch super pro pokemon edition i heard the new switch pro will have actually have a hollow projector so that you can change your living room into an entire enclosed space in the game i did giggle to myself a little bit when one article i read said that it's a competitor with the ps5 i mean technically um so is the big conversation why did they do the dates and nothing else yeah i mean i don't know if it's a big conversation it's just not it's just they did like they released the dates they made i mean they released the dates because we're six months out now right we've got to start our budgeting they could have easily waited two weeks though and if they decide to show a trailer at e3 they end with the date and people get all up if if we waited two weeks then it would be five months and two weeks out and not six years and that's harder to budget for we are a very rigid society here things to be in exact locations on the timeline or else we get lost and think that you know march was actually sixty or seven days long and april was only three there is the also the the possibility that we do get pokemon news before e3 and that somebody has an exclusive yeah so they have the trailer well obviously that i mean e3 is two weeks away so the obvious yeah but the trailer probably shows at least one exclusive thing that a company paid for probably game informer um game informer had an exclusive on sword and shield they've had exclusives on literally one game a month every month they out that's their thing they they release exclusive information then people cite game informer it's not unheard of does anybody get their actual do they do an actual magazine anymore or is it just a website i think they do a magazine and a digital magazine as well i mean they have exclusive website articles as well or like early the game informer first look i i got no problems with game informer it's fine i was i tried to work for them once uh so it there yeah there could be a couple things uh they were planning on releasing a bunch of news and then a deal came through where some site has an exclusive they just wanted to do dates and the rest of it was going to be e3 none of that could happen and they just released the dates for the heck of it i mean in the sense it worked because people were talking about it yeah which is something they've been struggling with this year in my opinion compared to the 20th anniversary where it felt like they had events all the time and weren't just in a vacuum of no 25th anniversary anything yeah it just felt like press in general like polygon and game informer and games spot and how ign we're always running a pokemon article every week do we think that they release the dates to stop the negative coverage of all the things happening with walmart cards no they released the dates to stop the negative coverage of everything to do with that awful katy perry song oh yeah uh okay so to then shift the conversation these dates are relatively close together they're two months away that was that's what i was going to say was like diamond and pearl came out september 13 2006. it's all about the battles platinum came out i may have got these wrong it may be either september 28 2008 whatever about two years later so what they were saying is the original diamond and pearl were two years worth of content but the faithful remakes are two months worth of content no i i i do think that they are somewhat worried about what legends arceus is going to do since it's a brand new thing that they've never done and they want it closer to when people are still super excited about sinnoh and they're playing through that game and they're like oh hey why don't you go back in time and also learn the origins of it so that it is in kids minds it's on parents radar it's within holiday shopping times there's an excitement built in there like there's still high levels of excitement around uh diamond and pearl and remakes correct me if i'm wrong but remakes tend not to sell as well as their originals right like the numbers are so i i i don't i i it to me it makes sense to have them close to each other like they are directly linked they're in the same region you are people who are looking people who don't like remates but are looking for a new pokemon game are going to want something around the holidays yeah but it's in january when i've already gone back to work and you know giving up all hope of holiday spirit it's because towards the end of january after being at work you need a good break you need to go visit new worlds and new vistas you need to find shinks i already got my shiny shanks so i have a theory okay well before i before i pitch the theory there's i i i think greg is right in the sense of not everyone likes remakes and they skip that kind of stuff so they don't feel like there's going to be an overlap in the audiences too much people did skip let's go pikachu let's go ev2 because they were just sick of kanto um i get it there was people talking that and i don't know i guess i can see where they're coming from although i don't agree with it that that because the dates are so close together that legends is going to be a relatively short game or they don't believe in legends but if that was the case they have why not why havok so close push it back then if you need more time because we know legends has been being worked on for several years now it's not like they've been working on only for a year they've been working on them for a while and they've had the opportunity to work on it for a while because ilka is doing diamond pearl my theory is that these games have a lot of compatibility with each other and that's the reason they're releasing them so close one because you'll need to buy them both so so they don't want you to get so bored with diamond and pearl that by the time you get legends you're like oh well i don't care about that game anymore they want you to play both at the same time and so the things you do in diamond pro will affect legends and the things you will do legends will do affect diamond pearl and this is their way to sell sell you two games relatively quickly because they'll be tied together in a way of like and they kind of this is such a small thing but they did this in like sword and shield where if it saw that you had let's go pikachu let's go eevee when you when you got to the wild area you got a free pikachu and a free eevee yeah yeah um so i think you lose if the games rely on each other whether that's like a monster hunter we i think will and i talked about this on the monster hunter our monster hunter podcast the carve shout out to the carve but monster hunter is doing a really cool thing with this where if you have stories too and rise um you get like exclusive outfits and stories too and then you get exclusive outfits and rise and it kind of gives you an incentive to like pick up the other game so i think what game freak or sorry what i think the pokemon company is thinking is that legends is going to bring in a bunch of new people who maybe have played pokemon in the past but didn't like the turn-based style or didn't like that it was so i don't want to say not open world but there's there's no sugar coating there's a breath of a wild charm that legends already has that people gravitate towards people always want oh is this like birth of the wild oh breath of the wild oh it's like breath of the wild like that's just the talking point right now makes me insane so you you attract those people who have never never played a pokemon game or have maybe a long time ago but this looks like breath of the wild and then you convince them to get diamond and pearl or vice versa you bring back the diamond and pearl people who haven't played in a while but love diamond and pearl and now another pokemon game that is connects to it is two months around the corner and you get them to buy that as well yeah i think that is their ultimate goal yeah and if in eight months nine months eight months that is come back to this episode and tell me i'm wrong that's fine but that's my only logic of why they're too close they're so close together not because like one is going to be bad so they need the other one to like fill in i don't think that's the case i think i think it's multiple things i i do think they're probably closely tied together i think they want to build off of the excitement for one or the other to sell the other game like i uh it is also very possible that they they through their play testing in research and looking at it realize that there's not a there's not a lot of overlap between the two that the audiences that want one aren't necessarily the audiences for the other so there they may be hoping to capture some people who are excited about the games but also understand that through their already research the two audiences for these two games are just very different mean you're going to have your pokemon fans like us who'll buy pretty much anything that has the pokemon name attached to it they don't have to worry about us they are worried and they've always been worried about getting new people to get their games yes so that's a distinct possibility it's it's just like there's people who won't like the the remakes and we'll get them in with pokemon legends and then the pokemon legends is like the launch of a new franchise so once people get sucked into that it's going to be like every pokemon legends that comes out in the future they'll be they'll be tied in for it i hate saying that though and then they can do like like or pokemon you know it could be a one-off like you know pokemon dash you know that game did really well everyone loved it nobody likes lucky no well well received by millions but what they could start is a cycle where it's like in november or autumn end of year is your more traditional pokemon game and then in spring or start of year it's when you get your pokemon legends or your alternative pokemon game your pokemon rangers redundant please may i please have a pokemon ranger for the 25th anniversary too late but please too late how about for the 30th it's only five years away i look i can't live forever greg what that tattoo time is ticking i do think there's a distinction between like traditional and like slightly non-traditional so like obviously legends would be the farthest away from i i mean i can't i can't even say that because we've seen like 30 seconds right but like most people would probably say that let's go pikachu let's go ev is slightly non-traditional because of the motion control yes um and a lot of people thought that oh all the remakes were going to go this style and that didn't be that's not the case but there's no reason for them not to keep doing remakes in the way that remix were i mean if we just look at like the worst selling i have remake was crystal um or third version i should say we're selling remake was heart gold soul silver spoiler the best was ruby and seth or omega ruby alpha sapphire which was the game so if omega ruby alpha sapphire sold 14 million and you're worth selling one sold 12 million yeah why would you never not do that yeah like i say this all the time but most video game companies would love to sell like a million copies of their game game freak can do the single they they can do 10 million easy yeah and coast i mean i mean there have been other big banner years too like 2012 had a bunch of things that came out in it it had uh in a pokemon conquest it had black and white two it had polka part two like they have loaded up years with a number of games before that have been close together because they realize that they have separate audiences for them or that the gameplay is going to appeal to a separate group of people that you know there's always going to be pokemon fans who buy everything in like 2012 we had a lot to buy that year yeah so like it is very i still think it's very much that i mean i'm not going to say that they are going to be tied together they're the same region and that may be the only thai i hope that there's 20 21. there will be something absolutely there's no way that like i i bet that in order to get arceus in the diamond and pro remakes you will need legends yeah that makes a lot like the poke flute will only be available i mean it's possible but i'm i i am not banking on it oh i i think so the other thing i want to say is i think that the date for legends if anything shows me confidence because they're like right at the start of the year like it like they said early if they needed more time they would have delayed they would not delayed it but they like what q1 is what till the end of march well it depends on your company and when they do their financial years but they also generally earn early so i don't know most people maybe consider april still early in the year it's not early but yeah i mean early 20 so early mean q1 like late q1 is march early q1 is january middle q1 is february if you consider the first three months of the year your first quarter i i think it'll all be fine i mean like i also i don't get i honestly don't understand how people are reading bad out of these dates well i just like there's there's a thought to me that there's just not going to be enough content in the diamond and pearl remakes to last more than two months and they're like all right we both got a bit of them something fast so that they don't lose interest in pokemon i think diamond and pearl is the longer the game you keep going back to because legends is a single player game with no like there's no competitive there's no training there's no so right there's people who are going to do the story of diamond and pearl and put it down and maybe like they're saying like it's a two-month story and now they switch over to legends and then they've still got them roped in for another month or two where like our competitive folks and our completionists and all of that biz will stay engaged with diamond and pearl no matter what and then legends will be you know one more 15-minute daily chore task do we think competitive is moving to diamond and pearl oh absolutely because they want to solve it has to right they want to sell those copies to those people i mean it's through a different company yeah i i i don't know i don't i i honestly don't know if competitive is going to move to diamond and pearl i don't know i'm not sold on that happening i think diamond and pearl are just remakes and they're keeping the competitive scene in sword and shield that would be the longest probably that any game has ever been on the competitive platform because because if they move competitive to diamond and pearl then if that is the case then are they moving dynamaxx to diamond and pearl post game maybe like there's a lot that has to go in that's currently in the competitive scene that has to go into these games they've they've gotten rid of stuff they got rid of mega evolutions and competitive i mean they they kept megas and let's go peach let's go eevee uh i mean you accessed it after you beat the game so i don't see why they i mean dynamaxx unlike megas or unlike z moves you just can't dynamax on a route you can't you could z move or mega and every wild caterpie you saw if you really wanted to you could do that every time so i don't think that's too hard for them to be like okay dynamaxx is in this game and it's when you beat the game and it's only in you know free play or uh versus or ladder um or battle tower i think that's i i think that's fine i think that's easy um and laura i mean lore wise none of this matters they did omega ruby alpha sapphire and they threw it all out the window there so like like i don't like the the the concept of dynamics is only exclusive to them not only that they introduce new megas in omega ruby they just threw it all out the window that game um so they could just be like this arena here was was built by leon after you kicked his butt and he came over here and he built this arena and only this arena you can die to max in i don't that's which can i can i just pause for a moment and let's pour one out for the breeding competitive team building functionality of omega ruby alpha sapphire which i have been enjoying yeah over the past month and just rekindled that spirit of boy all i had to do was hold up on the ride my bike around that island to hatch eggs and it was like so thoughtless and beautiful and perfect and oh powers and heck yeah bring back o powers my personal not complaint is i'm not one of those people that play through the story and then put it down i used to be um so i feel like uh as a as a gamer oh i feel like there's already too many games coming out too fast yes agree yeah and so that's my that's not really a complaint it's just like oh i feel like there's not enough breathing room because i know i'm going to be playing a lot of diamond and pearl i mean diamond in pearl is the 19th the new final fantasy 14 expansion's the 23rd of november and then like there's a lot of games that are competing for time i i agree there i would like more breathing room but that is a me problem yeah right that company that company does it deliberately to make me have to do these things right like who do you love more monster hunter [Laughter] all right before we take a break let's just talk about this pokemon home news real quick they did acknowledge that pokemon home is a product that exists uh we're on year two of it i believe we all paid our 16 twice at this point i'm going to do it again that's the thing i know i'm going to do it again because i don't want to deal with my i don't want to deal with having to pull things out by losing the storage a new update in a new update users will be introduced the the catch calendar this feature enables users to view their pokemon arranged by the dates they caught trainers can use this feature to relive memories from their adventures such as the day they caught their uh a certain pokemon or on a day an event or other occasion occurred or when they received the pokemon as a gift this update also introduces the ability to view pokemon registered in the pokedex in pokemon home from different angles such as above and behind trainers can get a better look trainers can try this out to get a better look of their pokemon it doesn't say this in the press release but they specifically said i think it was on pokemon.com uh or maybe it was in the emailed press release that it was a mobile update so i think well pokemon home is a mobile game well game is a weird word and yes i would say it's a mobile app um but the switch version is the one that's lacking the switch version is the one that like you can't even so when i'm like deleting pokemon um on twitch like i we're like catching a bunch of pokemon or we're like shiny hunting or whatever and i'm like or i'm breeding and i'm deleting people are always like oh why don't you just move them to home to mass delete and it's like i can't even see ribbons and marks in the switch version of home so i if i'm deleting them i have to like check them beforehand and if i'm already going through the sword and shield and i'm checking them and i'm seeing they don't have a mark or that this was one i wanted to keep i'm just going to delete it right there it's not that much slower but that that's like why why marks have ribbons have been around since generation three how can i not see them in the switch version of home i don't i don't get it i understand it but it doesn't sound like that that's getting an update i think they can catch calendar cool be able to see that like i like that a lot yeah which pokemon i caught first i can see which pokemon i caught i don't know on christmas i guess um i'll forever be reminded that my maghirna which i was supposed to get out on christmas i got an hour late so it ended up being on boxing day uh worthless throw it over just discard it release it i mean you should just check it and wait for another year you should just like get back no i'll wait until christmas next year it's been a real bummer um you should have done it like christmas eve yeah i don't yeah i really dropped the ball i forgot it was uh gmt yes yes a home de update sounds like it would be something cool like oh they're fixing it they're adding some stuff and they're like it's like yeah i mean like these two things are like they're fine i don't think they're ever going to convince somebody to spend 16 though like oh finally they ended the catch calendar time to pony it like who do they have like two people working on this and this is what they spent the last like eight months doing is like why would you need more than two people yeah you need we need one person to cover one person do the work the other one's covering their vacations yes that's all you need i mean i i don't know why they won't do things to the switch version and only the mobile version i mean i think technically the mobile version connects to more things right like it does yeah go and stuff so i i understand that if they're going to make changes they're going to make changes to that one i just don't know why they don't then just carry it over to the switch version like just bring it over just make the connection but like the catching thing makes morse makes sense because of go to me than the original games like i've been playing go steadily for what five years now so i have like a huge swath of time i remember when i played emerald and put it back down again because i don't reset my games like i play those for a very specific period of time whereas go is a huge in a continuing swath of time well i mean the underlying current here is that pokemon home is designed for pokemon go players first and everybody else next yeah gosh i wish it was i still hate hate's a strong word i still hate looking at my pokemon at home it's just there's something about it that that's why there's an update you can look at them from the top from the side from the bottom all the angles i don't know what niantic did compared to ilka but scrolling through my 3 000 pokemon in go is a much more enjoyable enjoyable experience than scrolling through my 4 000 pokemon in home like it's just smoother it looks better like the information i feel like is just conveyed better i don't know how to explain it it's just you know it's like playing a it's like playing a game that's a video game that's like really good except your character movement is like slightly off like have you ever played like a an adventure game where when you're running and everything it feels great and then you stop running and your character takes this weird like extra step after you've stopped moving and you're like don't is this from a specific game is this a thing that uh like the witcher had it monster hunter rise kind of has it they have like this weird step thing where if you try to move a little bit your character takes too many steps i don't know it just what i'm saying it just feels i wish the home viewing pokemon interface was more similar to go because i like that interface better what about goes interfaces missing from home that's some deep thoughts can't even put it towards it just feels bad like using the app just doesn't it it feels like a knockoff like something's not there but what's not there what is what bothers you about it like what is it what is it everything like what like the scrolling up and down now i gotta open it like too slow is it i mean for me it's the colors i don't like that color of aquamarine green whatever it is in the background i don't even think i have pokemon home installed on my phone yeah like when i'm looking at like all pokemon it's just maybe it's the grid thing they got rotating in the background is it the background that's what i'm saying it's the colors when i'm when i'm legit scrolling it feels awful like it's it's so it's so choppy yeah no i agree it's not it's not as smooth as how it goes choppy and then the second what do you mean how is it chopped steve hasn't gotten a new phone in like 18 years so 12 mini look if pokemon pokemon go is as much smoother experience and then when you tap on a pokemon that's all it looks bad i don't know everything about it is bad none of this matters i am deeply confused because when i'm scrolling through go with the same three across go is slower than home my goal is not slow at all also go this looks better go looks better like colors are better the pokemon are like smaller and then the names are like more bold because they had to fit the cp above yeah i don't know but i feel like they could put more information like they could put something above the pokemon names to make it like what i think i think go feels better yes i agree in what way when we are in person greg we will thoroughly go through this and report back because like i the only difference the only difference is the background yeah we're gonna do this in person because okay you are you are out of your gourd but i agree with him so two of us agree and one of us doesn't who's out of their actual gourd both of you you've taken the pill taking the go pill all right we need to take a break we will be right back tricks lucky charms coco puffs [Music] flavor [Music] sounds nice oh my gosh [Music] and we are back from our break uh we forgot to mention in the thrilling pokemon home news that you will be getting a bulbasaur and a squirtle capable of giganta maxing this june that that's it but what did say those words together to get them in game like well you only got one of them yeah okay you can give them soup yeah you're right yes well i mean how there's only so much soup in the world there's a lot of soup in that game there are mushrooms everywhere you can make soup for days there is yeah um um there's yeah that squirtle and bulbasaur get them while they're getting look i think it's just to balance out the charmanders no balancing out the charmanders at this point charander has gone too powerful it has taken over there's actually a card fight vanguard card that came out in the new set that is almost spelled like charizard and i was like are you serious it's time to start the crazy car the card is called velocihazard but if you take the ci and then the hazard it's the char hazard all right big news here is pokemon go fest 2021 details celebrate five years count on five five five five five of pokemon

nitty-gritty if will or greg invites you to a remote yeah and you're online and you're online you show what if they're already in a raid no excuses friend you gotta look you gotta have the mega symbol then people know you're serious about what i want that i want hound doom free yeah i don't i don't need that stress in my life did the did the copy literally say scalped [Music] did you throw that in as commentary yeah instantly do we even know what it looks like yet no we don't uh so they they didn't do the picture this is an audio podcast i'll describe it you see pop you see pop star pikachu you see rockstar pikachu um they both have the female tail if you didn't know this lore wise the cosplay pikachus are always female um there's some omega ruby alpha sapphire lower for you yep uh there's an all to know that makes sense shield on apom sock and throw so probably pretty safe to say i don't they didn't say in this blog post uh but stock and throw a regional they'll probably be spawning everywhere um we got chat that's gonna be original that makes sense because i don't know it sings music i guess uh there's an altaria head is also a note it's also a note yes and it's hard i don't get how soccer throw our musical i don't think they're musical i just think this is so last year they did some viper and zangoose they're the bouncers sorry that's the music festival um last year was heat more endurant because it was the first time they shoot the heat more endurant the year before that was the viper and zangoose i think these are just the two rival pokemon it's just their time yeah and they're the bouncers at the concert so they will sock you and throw you out maybe it's like the thing of rocky where they're going up the stairs what does it have to do with music cause it's the song no no x no forbidden i don't know what this is is it i have the tiger get out of it no get out of here done no it's the i have done we don't wanna be dmcad uh there's a wireless in the photo evolution of dyno yes this is approved why what is the significance of f and g although i mean obviously are two notes yes but there's other notes a b c d e f and s c being the prime one yeah typically or uh g c treble clef is g no hmm boy it's been a while since i looked at one of those things it's the eye of the time no that was not rocky one okay so rocky one is where he's running up the stairs that was a completely different song it was not eye of the tiger so get out of here that was like i had the tiger was like rocky three or rocky iv okay so when it got real real bad i think so okay so i i know what's already gonna happen in a year people are gonna complain that it's not 4.99 i think niantic did a pretty good job like letting you know that it was 14.99 originally and they strike through the price and they're like it's five five dollars five dollars for five years five dollars for five years yeah but i'm already like uh next year they're gonna be like well last year was five dollars and then there was better than this let's not worry about feature complaints we make next year we'll be in person too right yeah so of course we're not even touching on how inconsiderate they are with those dates look that's i was waiting for you to get to this wait what are those dates those dates are twin cities pride it's the same weekend as twin cities pride weekend which why the twin cities are having pride in july i know they had to push it back because of the whole everything right like it had to be pushed back but they should have checked in with the contingency in minnesota and verified those dates and the fact that they didn't means they are bad people maybe they just wanted to make sure mall america was loaded for pride we are not going to mall of america if we can be outside but mom america has air conditioning no it doesn't yeah we can be outside and actually it doesn't yeah it doesn't have air conditioning i feel like it's cooler in there than it is because it's a giant cave but it doesn't have air conditioning and if there's a lot of people in there it's not going to be cool because that's the play though it's only ever the cave biome that's the problem people will be like oh it's nice outside we're going out but we do the seven million iq go to mall america where no one is look look remember the kanto tour remember our remember the mega hound we were doing raids non-stop it was great we didn't have to invite anyone we were filled 20 people instantly there are places outside that we do not have these issues with either we can go to victory memorial park where there are millions of people and you will never wait either and you can enjoy the glory of outside also it is still bad that it's on pride weekend because now you are making me choose between my two loves being gay and playing pokemon you can do both at the same time clearly because if i go to the park if i go to luring park where pride is there are literally no stops there there's like really two well they that's they should have picked a different park and or mall of america the park was the established pokemon go is the newcomer pokemon go is the new thing trying to inch its way into our pride and i say the nay i feel like walking around a pride fest and playing pogo is a pretty good experience well if there's raid locations but there won't be anything there will be yeah but we don't have to worry about raids on day one they already said raids are day two see so you're so here so so you are fine with going to the big crowded okay i'm not gonna get i'm not gonna say that it's gonna be crazy i don't know if i have no idea how it's going i don't know how it's going to be this year to be completely honest well but what about this greg what if the alternative was that they scheduled go fest for state fair state fair is 10 days they're doing an extra long no go fest this year or something every monday i will find the owner of niantic and i will make him pay because you know what the state fair does they turn off pokemon go yeah well during state fair time all of the stops in the state fairgrounds are turned off are you serious i am dead serious haters you cannot replace pokemon go at the state fair i feel like that would bring more people in like i want to go and spend some stops and eat a cream puff the problem is no at the state fair which i've never been to in all my years of living in minnesota you haven't even left your house while living in minnesota but i've never entirely do house be quiet uh they they they want to keep people moving you're not supposed to stand still at the state fair you got to keep moving keep it going keep it going keep moving keep eating keep looking at all the stuff i am very excited for the safe here but yes the first year ago was out all the stops were on and then it became such a huge problem that uh the next year they were all off and they remain off all 10 days of the state fair you cannot play go at the state fair that sounds awful it's awesome because you can focus on other things for once in your life it's a problem now though now that like i i the first year the first year yes probably was a complete disaster because that was where the still hype was go was relatively new but i feel like now yeah but that would require somebody to go and both talk to the state fair and niantic about returning go to the fair and take the risk right that take the risk that they could be right or wrong there is so much to do at the fair you will not miss go uh it is two hours shorter yep it's from ten to six last year was from ten to eight uh so a couple things two things maybe this is the whole our podcast should just be named two things uh first thing is that they didn't say that there's a location this year this probably would have been the time to say we're doing an event i don't i think that ship has sailed probably for the best that's fine i don't think anyone's super upset about that um number two is they they did cut two hours off some people were like last year was exhausting because it was 10 hours i mean you guys were pretty exhausted for canto tour yep uh but the counter argument was no one's forcing you to start at 10 no one's forcing you to i'm going to point out as a counter example of why this is a deliberate attack on twin cities pride the hours of twin cities pride are from 10 a.m to 6 p.m both saturday and sunday this is a deliberate attack on my people my life the exact same times they shortened it they shortened it to match ex this is a conspiracy they shortened to go to the exact times the twin cities pride it's unacceptable uh counter argument is you don't have to play till eight you didn't have to start at 10. some people i play with you i have to start at 10 and i have to finish at 6. yes we have to do the whole thing there is not there is nothing but mega hound doom screaming and scorn if we don't do the entire time with you i mean i am probably going to pick a different mega for this event i don't know if houndhood's making the cut this summer we might run another one are you gonna pick there's no musical mega currently in the game uh i guess we don't know what's coming back to raids i'm maybe assuming they're gonna do dialga and palkia for raids they're not musical yeah but they did growled on kyogre last year it's gonna be that was weather yeah it's gonna be the weather theme last year uh no i think they're gonna use this i i think because groudon and kyogre did so well last year this is the opportunity to bring dialogue and palkia because they already announced diamond and pearl they're gonna milk all of those people because they're dying to get these legends you know what they should do to make up for their and if that's the case i'm going to bring like mega altaria or mega ampros because i want the dragon boost they need to put xerneas into the raids to make up for their attack on pride they need to put the pride deer in raids along with the alga and pelican what if it's dialga palkia xerneas and develtol i'm in i don't think they're going to turn those china yet i didn't say they would make them shiny they're not good they want to make money they're not going to put non-shiny evita right now again i already have a certain bacon bird zertius was here for like a week bring it back for pride you're already ruining my pride xerneas had two weeks whatever i i think the hour cut is fine i know some people are upset that they're losing two hours but i think it's fine because when they return to go fest next year which will be a thing that will be the normal time right from ten to six is i mean they did cut off like ten dollars so yeah and that's i mean you're paying for an abbreviated experience like if it was 14 if they didn't cut the time this year then next year they would have been 15 and were cutting the time to match with the people in the in-person event and then people would have been like oh well it's two less hours and you're giving me you're making me pay i think this like it's it's a lose-lose yep but this was whatever they that's fine like the the super super hardcore people that want their two extra hours to grind out candy are going to be very vocal but eight hours of pogo two and two 16 hours of pogo in a weekend ideally hopefully with your friends and then you can get dinner put your feet up rest for the next day i don't know it sounds awesome to me it sounds like a good time i'm very excited whether this event was 5 or 15 i would have purchased it but i would assume one if you're listening to this podcast and you play pogo i think it's probably a no-brainer that you're gonna buy this um if you play pogo even 10 minutes every day i don't see why you wouldn't buy this the only maybe like if you play poke like if you play pogo like twice a year yeah easy pass probably for you um and if you work that weekend yeah probably easy pass for you but if you're playing pogo i don't see why you don't just spend the five bucks right like i i totally understand there's free to play players and they they love to brag how they've never spent money ever on this game and how they they spend you know five hours in their car every evening idling to take out gyms to get their free 50 pokey coins so they can buy more storage i'm sure those people exist but if you got time to idle at your gym to get 50 coins every day just spend the five dollars i don't who would not be spending the five dollars it's just it feels like a no-brainer it feels good i mean pride is pride and not greg's pride i mean pride of i didn't give this game any money so it's like i in five years i haven't spent a cent on pokemon go after five years it's not going to change and that's a valid stance and i support that 100 oh speaking of events there was that verizon event this weekend uh yeah but none of us subscribed to verizon so so actually it was verizon mexican 7-eleven and yashinoko there were three different companies dang will with the the hot knowledge i was gonna follow because i got the news item today right after the event is half over okay so i normally go to my friend tim he's on verizon and he's got me codes before and he was saying the app wasn't working and i saw in the discord uh that people also with verizon they couldn't get the app to load so i was running out of time so i did the unfortunate thing of going to ebay and seeing how much people were charging and people were charging about 40 to 50 for this event and i was like i can't do that dude all you need to do was go on facebook because i have people on facebook who are legit like if you're on verizon but don't play pokemon go can you go to this thing and get me your code and they got like 30 codes off of it i i'm never going to go to facebook and ask for anything so i so somebody on ebay posted they had three codes and they were selling them for 25 on friday the event was saturday so i was like oh you are the ebayer i love you're undercutting everyone you want to move these products fast i'm in i'm in so i bought for 25 they sent me the code within five minutes worked perfectly flaw free that event onset the reason i'm bringing this up is because uh a bunch of people were panicking in my twitch of like whether they should or should not go to ebay to get into this event or whether they you didn't miss anything this event was not worth 25 even this event was not worth five dollars like it was you did get unknown spawn i don't think unknown v is worth 25 bucks it was like increased chance of shiny eevee two dinos i have so many shiny eevees if you're desperate for a shiny eevee just hit me up i'll get you one well i just like i knew it wasn't gonna be worth 25 but niantic's in this weird position where they have these partnered events with 7-eleven or verizon or sprint or whoever they do and they have to do this balance to make them like like good enough for the people to kind of go out and seek them out but also bad enough for people to be like oh i didn't miss anything so to anyone who missed the verizon event you didn't miss anything it like it was not like the only thing i have to remember this event is i have a little medal now in my collection that no one can see but me that says verizon so you have a sponsored medal that will constantly advertise to you that i paid money for that you paid money for yeah it's right next to my 799 mr my medal basically you know i used to think bobby was the sucker yeah no i think bobby's still a bigger sucker than i am oh you know bobby did this one you know 100 bobby did this one is bobby on verizon though i don't know i'm sure he found a way do we have any other closing thoughts on gofest 2021 i'm excited for it i'm i'm happy that i should be able to actually participate in this year versus you know being in a car for eight hours are am i coming if i i don't think i am not coming to you the the there are more people here than there are in milwaukee yeah yes yes we should go to chicago why should we go to chicago you hate chicago for the authenticity yeah we gotta make it feel good memories probably get a cheap hotel right now okay if you find a cheap hotel and you come and pick me up and take me there ah it's a lot of work all right just play pay for your plane they got flights from minnesota to chicago yeah i've taken that flight it's the it's the strangest experience ever uh yeah i don't mind going to minnesota i didn't love the victory memorial park though i didn't love it maybe because it was like no sidewalks it was just like this weird grass median that you just walked on maybe maybe uh maybe like along the river although i mean that's that's a lot that's a lot i will say i had a great time milwaukee nobody's ever said that no take those words back yeah no no i mean the art park is very nice look and we have lake michigan you guys don't got that we have lake superior we don't we're not going to no no my first trip to duluth is not for go fest no okay it's like duluth is like hey you guys want to go to 1984. okay cool yeah oh wait i'm going to duluth right after we're finished recording now yeah advertise it that way great it is great and they have a wonderful aquarium so duluth 50 times better than milwaukee that's that's a hard no not even people who live in duluth organized have you been to duluth when's the last time you were delivering for uh alex's bachelor i mean there you go that says a lot right there and then we went to mardi gras or whatever up by canada grand marais yeah grand marais hey no clue i don't remember a single bar called that in all of duluth let's go to grand marais i mean grand beret is okay no you wanna you wanna go wild we can go we're going to the northwest angle yeah we're going to get a boundary not a single pokestop in the northwest angle but you want to push it mr seinfeld we're going all the way to the geographical mistake that is the northwest angle oh boy oh boy where's our wheel guys grandma ray's not even by canada no you gotta get it to grandparents it's like an hour from canada what are you talking about greg we're gonna talk about your pokemon plush butt thing next week i mean as long as we get to it because i think it's the most important news that we have skipped so far you know i'm i'm very worried that we're going to be lacking news next week so we got to say all right let's save it the the the hopper what is our question of the week here question of the week what is it uh brandon maybe we can do both which slack says brandon with no initials brandon with the anime pic picture doesn't help what is a pokemon game wait wait did you do your song already greg okay uh what is a pokemon we're falling apart what is the pokemon game that you would defend to your last breath and how do you defend it omega ruby and alpha sapphire no no no i will defend emerald forever i don't think anyone hates emerald nobody does but i'll still well you do you hate i've never heard emerald never played emerald i don't like ruby sapphire emerald is real good though i think omega ruby alpha sapphire is excellent emerald is my all-time favorite game i think emerald is great and there are people out there who are all who do not like any of the gen 3 games and they are very wrong people there's a heck ton that's real good about omega ruby and alpha sapphire i will say that every time i bring up omega ruby and alpha sapphire to my friend chris he complains about the fact that he had to work really hard to get wadios or ladies in the original ruby and sapphire and they kind of just gave away vladio somebody has three well they gave away one because it was no you had to work really hard you had to suffer through the beginning of that game no you just said that's you that is you that is you you are a horrible person omega ruby alpha sapphire is an amazing series of games and you do not i mean the whole point of the remakes was to fly around on ladius and soar through the skies and look at the world and as a majestic person that you are and then go to space all of that is amazing and you don't get it here's here's my hot tech greg laura's now six out of ten for me it would have instantly been an eight out of ten if you didn't have hms if they did what they did in ultrasound here's the funny thing while i've been playing it recently i like i'm obviously i was hatching eggs and i was like i need to get i need to get a flame body i need to get a magma armor i need to get something that's going to make these eggs pop faster because i don't have all morning waiting for these eggs to to come out um which that's a different story i won't even get into my complaint about egg hatching in omega ruby office high sci-fi but i completely forgot did you get that route i completely forgot that you can use the eon flute to call your ladies or your ladios to fly anywhere and i was like this is a good part of the game literally taught a zubat fly why would you do these things so i could fly over to where i could get a flame to get a numble to evolve it into a camera so i could have magma armor and then and i also forgot about blissy bases which you know and then i finally finally that clicked back into place to evolve my numbers and camera ups and get all that stuff done but boy see i thought blissey bases were were were one of the redeeming features of omega ruby off of sapphire so let me introduce you to the xl candy that you get no no i don't no candy no no artificial i'm not giving my pokemon steroids no no they learned through training but here training training training no shortcuts there is and somebody can research this and let me know because i know i'm right because i hatch a lot of eggs i hatch a lot of eggs in omega ruby and alpha sapphire the egg counter it's it has to be like it only counts the first egg unhatched egg in your party or something because it's like i like hatch one egg and then i got to go around the island three more times before the next egg and then i go to the island around three more times before the next deck and they're all ralts they should all have relatively equivalent step counters for hatching those eggs if i'm in sword and shield at the same time huh you didn't get them all at the same time no no i i picked them all up out of my computer because i've got like 200 eggs in my computer right um if i'm in sword and shield and i have five eggs in my party and they're all uh no i'm what am i what is that bug that i'm doing right now the the scorch insect the the bee bomb no no i already did rebecca no i did it was pokemon of the week like four weeks ago and we've already forgot either way when when it's a combi yes and when the first one hatches they all hatch at the same time so i don't know what they changed in egg hatching between these games but it is notable and that is annoying very true okay so i know mike what is steve what are you defending with your last breath you know honestly it'd probably be pokemon go who hates pokemon go a lot of people do yeah that's not real pokemon oh felon i don't know pokemon go just like [Laughter] it it's it's like a game that yeah i would i would just defend it it is so much of my life especially with like the last five years of you know some days i play at only 10 minutes but other days i can play it for an hour and then like the weekend you know go fest coming up i'm very excited to play for 16 hours and probably after the event is over i'll keep playing like it is just one of those games that they keep adding features to that i keep going back to and like i can't imagine just dropping it at this point that's called the sunk cost fallacy wow nah i get like he's made his career off the sunk cost fallacy so yeah that's true that's true plus the added transferring to home is such a huge like if it feels like it it didn't waste my time like i was able to move those over into yeah probably pokemon go honestly so will your defending ranger uh no i i black and white for me honestly for me black and white was the last pokemon game where they tried to include all of the things up to that point and there's no ribbons in black and white they had to cut something out well you can see your ribbons from old games but you can't earn any new ones i don't have never cared about ribbons but they had night and day it had seasons it had and and the seasons actually changed the territory and you just had different battle systems in there and it was just there's so many wonderful things about black and white not i mean i do love x and y quite a bit but it's just like black and white is kind of like if you want to think of like phases of the pokemon games i think black and white was a closing phase of like the first era of pokemon games and why you like black and white so much it's the generation's ultimate before world uh yes yes yes that that uh simile or uh yes that works um i i mean i agree with you i think i think it's very very good i don't know i did like worlds i know you didn't but i liked world a lot black two and white two i i enjoy i why i did not select them is because it's they're just not necessary yeah and the whole coldress story is weird because i pokemon company please explain to me is he a villain or is he he a hero or is is he he is a complicated character i am a coal risk fan why does he get to take vacations in hawaii after he tried to destroy unova by covering it in ice and torturing pokemon doing that for science okay science isn't a crime are we in bioshock now yes there's no no rules except for the progress of man yes yes at the expense right there he also had bad hair would you kindly come to my ship and deal with kites no stop no poor kirim the most pure and beautiful of all pokemon tormented by that horrible man so there you go well pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon uh i i gave you a list mouse tiny mouse cheering ella squirrel antenna roly-poly yeah roly-poly or two-sided pokemon those are that's the list and then i mentioned a 2012 version of the pokemon in the tcg had call for family which allows you for one colorless energy as an attack you can search for two basic pokemon and put them onto your bench very valuable card if you get it early in the game uh and that's all you needed to know so who's that pokemon it's reggie drago in 2012 in 2012 yes uh look this was two weeks ago i wrote down it's a mulga a moga yes no i'm verifying that my past self was correct you are correct it was imoga uh those uh all those pokemons that i read are all the electric rodent emblematic pokemon from every generation yes and the moga the moga card did feature call for family which if you were playing rey eels was the deck then you could use imoga to call out the eels or the baby rayquaza if that's the card that you needed to play uh pokemon shovel icon is so cute and i think imoga is much maligned in the pokemon cartoon because it's always shown as being like greedy and no imoga's just a sweetie i once had a flying squirrel in my house and it was as a pet or as a visitor accidentally got in there it wasn't supposed to be there uh good good but not great shiny ah i think my next shiny hunt is gonna be imoga i don't need to what are you making squinty eyes at me for do you have a shiny imoga i don't i don't well there you go like a moga's fine i just like to deny and together and those pokemon better yawn big yawn they don't fly sure they pick them up and throw them if they don't they don't anymore trivia for a moga yeah i mean it's been around for 10 years now no there isn't any is it masters i don't think so it's abstract and road time for elisa yeah yeah i don't think i'm trying to think of a mug has ever been in an egg but no uh yeah the trivia is bad moga was first seen in an image on august 7th 2010 amolga is the only pokemon with the base stat total of 428. [Music] it may be based on a flying squirrel maybe i think yes all right this week's pokemon here we go number one i have never said that you cannot research these clues online or however all your resources i do not expect anyone to know these off the top of their head you don't have to ask permission to look these up go right ahead number two this week's pokemon has two forms one of which features either a wigglytuff or jigglypuff doll with its stuffing exposed number three another popular card introduced in 2012 this pokemon could potentially stop key components of opponent's decks from functioning but had to be used very carefully that's all you get that's if you don't know it from all that i'm look it up look it up on the go on the internet the internet hey thanks for listening thanks for making it to the end of the show uh if you are listening to this on monday morning this is your last attempt to subscribe to our patreon to get nick's bonus music six songs uh last opportunity opportunity chance last attempt like are you gonna like everybody's chat you're gonna fail trying it so uh patreon.com pkmncast or ise.cash if you want to subscribe to our patreon we did run a special offer in the month of may where if anyone signs up at the five dollar or more they will get an exclusive six song album of our break music from nick uh also you get the bonus podcasts you get the other rewards you get access to the slack you get all that if you are not interested in the music and you still want to sign up i would wait just one day and sign up on july sorry june 1st it's not july yet it's june uh otherwise patreon will charge you the 31st and then it will charge you the first so just last opportunity if you want to get that break music um and then if you want to support us june 1st is the way the way around this though is you can do the annual plan so you can do the full year and then you don't have to worry about getting charged twice and then you save two months because if you do a full year you get two months free which is really great so a full year of supporting us is only 50 bucks instead of 60 yeah that's how math works so you save ten dollars um but thank you thank you thank you for listening uh greg is at white wing on twitter will is at wash in the sink i'm at dragging a lake if you want to follow the podcast at pkmncast on twitter twitch tiktok instagram youtube we're really close of hitting 15k on youtube so if you haven't subscribed to the youtube channel youtube.com pkmencast but thank you for listening appreciate it thank you for making to the end this has been another episode of the pokemon podcast then we are super effective why is that so super depressed apparently because i've got to counteract this radio dj zoo crew we're super ripped for the super sue crew bringing you the hottest hits from the pokemon world from the 80s 90s and beyond [Music] you
