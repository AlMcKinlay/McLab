five-minute conversation no we had (2:24 - 2:27)

show is we can take something like dates (2:30 - 2:37)

when certain events were scheduled at (2:43 - 2:46)
the same time that other events are (2:44 - 2:48)
scheduled and therefore the implications (2:46 - 2:50)
of the intentions behind the schedulers (2:48 - 2:51)
of the scheduling schedules (2:50 - 2:54)

series takes a bold (5:32 - 5:37)
new direction fusing action with rpg (5:34 - 5:38)
elements (5:37 - 5:39)
the game takes place in the cinahl (5:38 - 5:42)
region of the past (5:39 - 5:45)
long before dinosaurs roamed oh no it's (5:42 - 5:46)
as long before the events of pokemon (5:45 - 5:48)
diamond and pearl version (5:46 - 5:50)
the as the game's protagonist the (5:48 - 5:51)
players will set out and create (5:50 - 5:54)
and complete the region's first pokedex (5:51 - 5:55)
by catching (5:54 - 5:57)
surveying and researching wild pokemon (5:55 - 5:58)

cover art revealed here for the first (5:58 - 6:01)
time depicts mount (6:00 - 6:04)
coronet towering over the expanse (6:01 - 6:08)
of a bygone sinnoh region (6:04 - 6:11)
the setting for the story in pokemon (6:08 - 6:12)
legends (6:11 - 6:14)
arceus all right we'll stop there (6:12 - 6:15)
there's (6:14 - 6:16)
the pokemon home to stuff we'll we'll (6:15 - 6:21)
get to that (6:16 - 6:24)
so they have dates (6:21 - 6:24)
we have uh november 18th for (6:25 - 6:30)
diamond pearl yep correct (6:32 - 6:39)
sorry 19th but i don't know why 18th was (6:35 - 6:39)
on the line (6:39 - 6:42)
uh already messing up the dates they (6:39 - 6:42)
gave us (6:42 - 6:44)
literally little news and i already (6:42 - 6:46)
messed it up november 19th (6:44 - 6:49)
for brilliant diamond shining pearl and (6:46 - 6:49)
then (6:49 - 6:53)
legends of arceus will be january 28th (6:49 - 6:59)
2020. they did say early 20 sorry 2022. (6:53 - 7:03)
uh they did say early 2022 for arceus (6:59 - 7:07)
and they said holiday for (7:03 - 7:11)
diamond and pearl so there is the (7:07 - 7:14)
i think a shocker for a lot of people (7:11 - 7:15)
which are these two dates are pretty (7:14 - 7:16)
close together (7:15 - 7:18)
we're going to put that on the back (7:16 - 7:19)
burner (7:18 - 7:24)
and talk about we're going to talk about (7:19 - 7:26)
that that was my front burner right (7:24 - 7:28)
there yeah that is the only burner that (7:26 - 7:30)
is the only fight i think before (7:28 - 7:33)
okay before we talk about the the (7:30 - 7:34)
elephant in the room which (7:33 - 7:36)
these dates are very close together we (7:34 - 7:38)
can talk about the lack (7:36 - 7:41)
not true if 2020 taught us anything (7:38 - 7:44)
months can feel like years the the lack (7:41 - 7:46)
of the elephant is they (7:44 - 7:48)
just gave us dates and cover art and no (7:46 - 7:49)
trailer and no (7:48 - 7:53)
new information and no anything else (7:49 - 7:56)
which is i'm not mad (7:53 - 7:58)
about it like i'm not upset i'm not like (7:56 - 7:59)
oh why didn't we (7:58 - 8:03)
like it's just it's just weird (7:59 - 8:06)
i don't know that it's that weird (8:03 - 8:08)
how much more is there to say about (8:06 - 8:12)
faithful rebates there's an e3 coming (8:08 - 8:12)
they have to save some things in the pot (8:12 - 8:17)
it could it could be because they were (8:15 - 8:17)
lacking (8:17 - 8:19)
other e3 news they were gonna be like (8:17 - 8:21)
well we gotta we gotta pat it out with (8:19 - 8:22)
some pokemon stuff because normally (8:21 - 8:25)
normally patterns have been broken (8:22 - 8:26)
patterns (8:25 - 8:28)
normally we get the pokemon stuff a (8:26 - 8:30)
little bit before e3 and then we (8:28 - 8:32)
normally get like a treehouse thing of (8:30 - 8:32)
like (8:32 - 8:35)
okay let's play (8:32 - 8:35)
yeah but the treehouse has been closed (8:36 - 8:40)
down (8:39 - 8:42)
like okay so even if even if the (8:40 - 8:44)
argument is (8:42 - 8:47)
well e3 is around the corner yeah (8:44 - 8:49)
why why announce within the why just why (8:47 - 8:51)
wait why not just wait two weeks i don't (8:49 - 8:52)
understand (8:51 - 8:55)
because e3 is in like two weeks is it i (8:52 - 8:56)
thought it was like three whatever well (8:55 - 8:56)
i mean (8:56 - 8:58)
they they don't want to get overwhelmed (8:56 - 9:01)
by the introduction of the switch pro (8:58 - 9:03)
yeah oh my gosh they don't want to get (9:01 - 9:04)
like (9:03 - 9:05)
they don't want to they want to pull (9:04 - 9:07)
focus from yeah (9:05 - 9:10)
from pokken 4 and the new switch super (9:07 - 9:10)
pro (9:10 - 9:14)
pokemon edition i heard the new switch (9:10 - 9:15)
pro will have (9:14 - 9:17)
actually have a hollow projector so that (9:15 - 9:18)
you can (9:17 - 9:21)
change your living room into an entire (9:18 - 9:24)
enclosed space in the game i did giggle (9:21 - 9:26)
to myself a little bit when one article (9:24 - 9:28)
i read said that it's a (9:26 - 9:32)
competitor with the ps5 (9:28 - 9:32)
i mean technically (9:32 - 9:38)
um (9:35 - 9:38)
so is the big conversation why did they (9:40 - 9:44)
do the dates and nothing else (9:42 - 9:46)
yeah i mean i don't know if it's a big (9:44 - 9:47)
conversation it's just not (9:46 - 9:50)
it's just they did like they released (9:47 - 9:51)
the dates (9:50 - 9:53)
they made i mean they released the dates (9:51 - 9:55)
because we're six months out now (9:53 - 9:57)
right we've got to start our budgeting (9:55 - 9:59)
they could have easily waited (9:57 - 10:01)
two weeks though and if they decide to (9:59 - 10:02)
show a trailer at e3 (10:01 - 10:04)
they end with the date and people get (10:02 - 10:06)
all up if if we waited (10:04 - 10:07)
two weeks then it would be five months (10:06 - 10:09)
and two weeks out and not six (10:07 - 10:12)
years and that's harder to budget for we (10:09 - 10:13)
are a very rigid (10:12 - 10:16)
society here things to be in exact (10:13 - 10:18)
locations on the timeline or else we get (10:16 - 10:20)
lost and think that you know march was (10:18 - 10:21)
actually sixty (10:20 - 10:24)
or seven days long and april was only (10:21 - 10:25)
three (10:24 - 10:28)
there is the also the the possibility (10:25 - 10:29)
that (10:28 - 10:32)
we do get pokemon news before (10:29 - 10:35)
e3 and that somebody (10:32 - 10:39)
has an exclusive yeah so (10:35 - 10:42)
they have the trailer well obviously (10:39 - 10:42)
that (10:42 - 10:44)
i mean e3 is two weeks away so the (10:42 - 10:47)
obvious yeah (10:44 - 10:49)
but the trailer probably shows at least (10:47 - 10:51)
one exclusive thing (10:49 - 10:53)
that a company paid for probably game (10:51 - 10:54)
informer (10:53 - 10:56)
um game informer had an exclusive on (10:54 - 10:57)
sword and shield they've had exclusives (10:56 - 10:58)
on (10:57 - 11:00)
literally one game a month every month (10:58 - 11:01)
they out that's their thing (11:00 - 11:04)
they they release exclusive information (11:01 - 11:08)
then people cite game informer it's (11:04 - 11:10)
not unheard of does anybody get their (11:08 - 11:12)
actual do they do an actual magazine (11:10 - 11:14)
anymore or is it just a website (11:12 - 11:16)
i think they do a magazine and a digital (11:14 - 11:18)
magazine as well (11:16 - 11:20)
i mean they have exclusive website (11:18 - 11:22)
articles as well (11:20 - 11:25)
or like early the game informer first (11:22 - 11:25)
look (11:25 - 11:28)
i i got no problems with game informer (11:25 - 11:29)
it's fine i was i tried to work for them (11:28 - 11:30)
once (11:29 - 11:33)
uh so it there yeah there could be a (11:30 - 11:34)
couple things (11:33 - 11:37)
uh they were planning on releasing a (11:34 - 11:38)
bunch of news and then a deal came (11:37 - 11:40)
through where some site has an exclusive (11:38 - 11:42)
they just wanted to do dates and the (11:40 - 11:44)
rest of it was going to be (11:42 - 11:46)
e3 none of that could happen and they (11:44 - 11:47)
just released the dates for the heck of (11:46 - 11:48)
it (11:47 - 11:49)
i mean in the sense it worked because (11:48 - 11:51)
people were talking about it (11:49 - 11:53)
yeah which is something they've been (11:51 - 11:55)
struggling with this year in my opinion (11:53 - 11:57)
compared to the 20th anniversary where (11:55 - 11:59)
it felt like they had events all the (11:57 - 12:00)
time and weren't just (11:59 - 12:03)
in a vacuum of no 25th anniversary (12:00 - 12:04)
anything (12:03 - 12:07)
yeah it just felt like press (12:04 - 12:09)
in general like polygon and game (12:07 - 12:10)
informer and games (12:09 - 12:14)
spot and how ign we're always (12:10 - 12:17)
running a pokemon article every week do (12:14 - 12:18)
we think (12:17 - 12:21)
that they release the dates to stop the (12:18 - 12:22)
negative coverage of all the things (12:21 - 12:23)
happening with (12:22 - 12:26)
walmart cards no (12:23 - 12:28)
they released the dates to stop the (12:26 - 12:29)
negative coverage of everything to do (12:28 - 12:31)
with that awful katy perry song (12:29 - 12:34)
oh yeah (12:31 - 12:34)
uh okay so to then shift the (12:36 - 12:41)
conversation (12:39 - 12:43)
these dates are relatively close (12:41 - 12:44)
together (12:43 - 12:46)
they're two months away that was that's (12:44 - 12:48)
what i was going to say was like (12:46 - 12:51)
diamond and pearl came out september 13 (12:48 - 12:55)
2006. it's all about the battles (12:51 - 12:58)
platinum came out i may have got these (12:55 - 13:00)
wrong it may be (12:58 - 13:02)
either september 28 2008 whatever about (13:00 - 13:04)
two years later (13:02 - 13:06)
so what they were saying is the original (13:04 - 13:07)
diamond and pearl (13:06 - 13:10)
were two years worth of content but the (13:07 - 13:12)
faithful remakes (13:10 - 13:21)
are two months worth of content (13:12 - 13:25)
no i i i do (13:21 - 13:28)
think that they are (13:25 - 13:32)
somewhat worried about (13:28 - 13:35)
what legends arceus is going to (13:32 - 13:37)
do since it's a brand new thing that (13:35 - 13:38)
they've never done (13:37 - 13:40)
and they want it closer to when people (13:38 - 13:43)
are still super excited about sinnoh (13:40 - 13:44)
and they're playing through that game (13:43 - 13:46)
and they're like oh hey why don't you go (13:44 - 13:49)
back in time and also learn (13:46 - 13:52)
the origins of it so that it is in kids (13:49 - 13:54)
minds it's on parents radar (13:52 - 13:57)
it's within holiday shopping times (13:54 - 13:59)
there's an excitement built in there (13:57 - 14:01)
like there's still high levels of (13:59 - 14:02)
excitement around (14:01 - 14:05)
uh diamond and pearl and remakes correct (14:02 - 14:07)
me if i'm wrong but remakes tend not to (14:05 - 14:08)
sell (14:07 - 14:12)
as well as their originals right (14:08 - 14:17)
like the numbers are so (14:12 - 14:20)
i i i don't i i it to me it makes sense (14:17 - 14:22)
to have them close to each other (14:20 - 14:24)
like they are directly linked they're in (14:22 - 14:27)
the same region (14:24 - 14:27)
you are people who are looking people (14:27 - 14:31)
who don't like remates but are looking (14:29 - 14:32)
for (14:31 - 14:34)
a new pokemon game are going to want (14:32 - 14:37)
something around the holidays (14:34 - 14:37)
yeah but it's in january when i've (14:40 - 14:43)
already gone back to work and (14:41 - 14:45)
you know giving up all hope of holiday (14:43 - 14:46)
spirit (14:45 - 14:48)
it's because towards the end of january (14:46 - 14:50)
after being at work you need a good (14:48 - 14:52)
break you need to go visit new worlds (14:50 - 14:53)
and new vistas (14:52 - 14:56)
you need to find shinks (14:53 - 14:56)
i already got my shiny shanks so (14:56 - 15:03)
i have a theory (15:01 - 15:03)
okay well before i before i pitch the (15:05 - 15:09)
theory (15:08 - 15:12)
there's i i (15:09 - 15:16)
i think greg is right in the sense of (15:12 - 15:18)
not everyone likes remakes and they skip (15:16 - 15:20)
that kind of stuff so they don't feel (15:18 - 15:21)
like there's going to be an overlap in (15:20 - 15:22)
the audiences (15:21 - 15:26)
too much people did skip let's go (15:22 - 15:27)
pikachu let's go ev2 because (15:26 - 15:33)
they were just sick of kanto um i get it (15:27 - 15:33)
there was people talking (15:33 - 15:40)
that and i don't know (15:37 - 15:41)
i guess i can see where they're coming (15:40 - 15:45)
from although i don't agree with it that (15:41 - 15:45)
that because the dates are so close (15:45 - 15:50)
together that legends is going to be a (15:48 - 15:51)
relatively short game (15:50 - 15:54)
or they don't believe in legends but if (15:51 - 15:56)
that was the case (15:54 - 15:58)
they have why not why havok so close (15:56 - 16:00)
push it back then (15:58 - 16:02)
if you need more time because we know (16:00 - 16:03)
legends (16:02 - 16:06)
has been being worked on for several (16:03 - 16:08)
years now it's not like (16:06 - 16:10)
they've been working on only for a year (16:08 - 16:12)
they've been working on them for a while (16:10 - 16:14)
and they've had the opportunity to work (16:12 - 16:15)
on it for a while (16:14 - 16:21)
because ilka is doing diamond pearl (16:15 - 16:21)
my theory is that these games (16:21 - 16:26)
have a lot of compatibility with each (16:24 - 16:28)
other (16:26 - 16:28)
and that's the reason they're releasing (16:29 - 16:33)
them so close one (16:30 - 16:36)
because you'll need to buy them both so (16:33 - 16:38)
so they don't want you to get so bored (16:36 - 16:41)
with diamond and pearl (16:38 - 16:44)
that by the time you get legends (16:41 - 16:46)
you're like oh well i don't care about (16:44 - 16:47)
that game anymore they want you to play (16:46 - 16:49)
both at the same time and so the things (16:47 - 16:51)
you do in diamond pro will affect (16:49 - 16:52)
legends and the things you will do (16:51 - 16:53)
legends will do (16:52 - 16:56)
affect diamond pearl and this is their (16:53 - 16:58)
way (16:56 - 17:01)
to sell sell you two games relatively (16:58 - 17:02)
quickly (17:01 - 17:05)
because they'll be tied together in a (17:02 - 17:07)
way of like (17:05 - 17:08)
and they kind of this is such a small (17:07 - 17:10)
thing but they did this in like sword (17:08 - 17:10)
and shield (17:10 - 17:12)
where if it saw that you had let's go (17:10 - 17:14)
pikachu let's go eevee (17:12 - 17:16)
when you when you got to the wild area (17:14 - 17:18)
you got a free pikachu and a free eevee (17:16 - 17:22)
yeah yeah um (17:18 - 17:22)
so i think you lose if the games rely on (17:23 - 17:30)
each other whether that's like (17:28 - 17:32)
a monster hunter we i think will and i (17:30 - 17:33)
talked about this on the monster hunter (17:32 - 17:35)
our monster hunter podcast the carve (17:33 - 17:37)
shout out to the carve but (17:35 - 17:38)
monster hunter is doing a really cool (17:37 - 17:40)
thing with this where if you have (17:38 - 17:41)
stories too (17:40 - 17:44)
and rise um you get like exclusive (17:41 - 17:46)
outfits and stories too and then you get (17:44 - 17:49)
exclusive outfits and rise (17:46 - 17:51)
and it kind of gives you an incentive to (17:49 - 17:52)
like (17:51 - 17:54)
pick up the other game so i think what (17:52 - 17:56)
game freak or sorry what i think the (17:54 - 17:58)
pokemon company is thinking (17:56 - 18:02)
is that legends (17:58 - 18:04)
is going to bring in a bunch of new (18:02 - 18:05)
people (18:04 - 18:08)
who maybe have played pokemon in the (18:05 - 18:08)
past (18:08 - 18:11)
but didn't like the turn-based style or (18:08 - 18:12)
didn't like that it was so (18:11 - 18:15)
i don't want to say not open world but (18:12 - 18:16)
there's (18:15 - 18:17)
there's no sugar coating there's a (18:16 - 18:20)
breath of a wild charm that legends (18:17 - 18:21)
already has (18:20 - 18:23)
that people gravitate towards people (18:21 - 18:25)
always want oh is this like birth of the (18:23 - 18:26)
wild (18:25 - 18:27)
oh breath of the wild oh it's like (18:26 - 18:29)
breath of the wild like that's just the (18:27 - 18:30)
talking point right now (18:29 - 18:33)
makes me insane so you you attract those (18:30 - 18:35)
people who have never never played a (18:33 - 18:37)
pokemon game or have maybe a long time (18:35 - 18:37)
ago but (18:37 - 18:39)
this looks like breath of the wild and (18:37 - 18:41)
then (18:39 - 18:42)
you convince them to get diamond and (18:41 - 18:44)
pearl or vice versa you bring (18:42 - 18:46)
back the diamond and pearl people who (18:44 - 18:47)
haven't played in a while but love (18:46 - 18:48)
diamond and pearl and now another (18:47 - 18:50)
pokemon game that is (18:48 - 18:52)
connects to it is two months around the (18:50 - 18:53)
corner (18:52 - 18:55)
and you get them to buy that as well (18:53 - 18:58)
yeah i think that is their ultimate goal (18:55 - 19:03)
yeah and if in eight months (18:58 - 19:06)
nine months eight months that is come (19:03 - 19:07)
back to this episode and tell me i'm (19:06 - 19:08)
wrong that's fine (19:07 - 19:09)
but that's my only logic of why they're (19:08 - 19:11)
too close they're so close together (19:09 - 19:14)
not because like (19:11 - 19:14)
one is going to be bad so they need the (19:15 - 19:18)
other one to like (19:17 - 19:20)
fill in i don't think that's the case i (19:18 - 19:22)
think i think it's multiple things (19:20 - 19:24)
i i do think they're probably closely (19:22 - 19:26)
tied together i think they (19:24 - 19:28)
want to build off of the excitement for (19:26 - 19:31)
one or the other to sell the other (19:28 - 19:35)
game like i uh (19:31 - 19:38)
it is also very possible that they they (19:35 - 19:38)
through their (19:38 - 19:41)
play testing in research and looking at (19:38 - 19:43)
it realize that there's not a (19:41 - 19:45)
there's not a lot of overlap between the (19:43 - 19:48)
two that the audiences that want one (19:45 - 19:50)
aren't necessarily the audiences for the (19:48 - 19:51)
other so there (19:50 - 19:55)
they may be hoping to capture (19:51 - 19:56)
some people who are excited about the (19:55 - 19:59)
games but also understand that (19:56 - 20:02)
through their already research the two (19:59 - 20:03)
audiences for these two games are just (20:02 - 20:07)
very different mean you're going to have (20:03 - 20:08)
your (20:07 - 20:11)
pokemon fans like us who'll buy pretty (20:08 - 20:13)
much anything that has the pokemon name (20:11 - 20:14)
attached to it (20:13 - 20:16)
they don't have to worry about us they (20:14 - 20:18)
are worried and they've always been (20:16 - 20:18)
worried about (20:18 - 20:20)
getting new people to get their games (20:18 - 20:22)
yes (20:20 - 20:22)
so that's a distinct possibility it's (20:22 - 20:26)
it's just like there's people who won't (20:24 - 20:27)
like (20:26 - 20:29)
the the remakes and we'll get them in (20:27 - 20:31)
with pokemon legends and then the (20:29 - 20:33)
pokemon legends is like the launch of a (20:31 - 20:35)
new franchise so (20:33 - 20:37)
once people get sucked into that it's (20:35 - 20:38)
going to be like every pokemon legends (20:37 - 20:40)
that comes out in the future (20:38 - 20:44)
they'll be they'll be tied in for it (20:40 - 20:46)
i hate saying that though and then they (20:44 - 20:49)
can do like like (20:46 - 20:49)
or pokemon you know it could be a (20:51 - 20:54)
one-off like you know pokemon dash you (20:52 - 20:55)
know that game did really well everyone (20:54 - 20:56)
loved it (20:55 - 20:59)
nobody likes lucky no well well received (20:56 - 21:02)
by millions but what they could start is (20:59 - 21:03)
a cycle (21:02 - 21:06)
where it's like in november or (21:03 - 21:09)
autumn end of year is your more (21:06 - 21:11)
traditional pokemon game (21:09 - 21:14)
and then in spring or start of year it's (21:11 - 21:15)
when you get your (21:14 - 21:17)
pokemon legends or your alternative (21:15 - 21:20)
pokemon game your pokemon rangers (21:17 - 21:22)
redundant please may i please have a (21:20 - 21:24)
pokemon ranger for (21:22 - 21:27)
the 25th anniversary too late but please (21:24 - 21:28)
too late (21:27 - 21:30)
how about for the 30th it's only five (21:28 - 21:32)
years away i look i can't live forever (21:30 - 21:34)
greg (21:32 - 21:37)
what that tattoo time is ticking i do (21:34 - 21:41)
think there's a distinction between (21:37 - 21:41)
like traditional and like slightly (21:42 - 21:46)
non-traditional (21:45 - 21:49)
so like obviously legends would be the (21:46 - 21:50)
farthest away from (21:49 - 21:52)
i i mean i can't i can't even say that (21:50 - 21:54)
because we've seen like 30 seconds (21:52 - 21:56)
right but like most people would (21:54 - 21:58)
probably say that (21:56 - 21:59)
let's go pikachu let's go ev is slightly (21:58 - 22:01)
non-traditional because of the motion (21:59 - 22:02)
control (22:01 - 22:05)
yes um and a lot of people thought that (22:02 - 22:06)
oh all the remakes were going to go this (22:05 - 22:07)
style (22:06 - 22:11)
and that didn't be that's not the case (22:07 - 22:11)
but there's no reason for them (22:12 - 22:19)
not to keep doing remakes in the way (22:16 - 22:20)
that remix (22:19 - 22:22)
were i mean if we just look at like the (22:20 - 22:24)
worst selling (22:22 - 22:28)
i have remake was crystal (22:24 - 22:30)
um or third version i should say we're (22:28 - 22:32)
selling remake was heart gold soul (22:30 - 22:33)
silver (22:32 - 22:36)
spoiler the best was ruby and seth or (22:33 - 22:37)
omega ruby alpha sapphire which was the (22:36 - 22:39)
game so (22:37 - 22:42)
if omega ruby alpha sapphire sold 14 (22:39 - 22:44)
million and you're worth selling one (22:42 - 22:48)
sold 12 million yeah why would you never (22:44 - 22:51)
not do that yeah (22:48 - 22:52)
like i say this all the time but most (22:51 - 22:54)
video game companies would love to (22:52 - 22:57)
sell like a million copies of their game (22:54 - 22:58)
game freak can do the single (22:57 - 23:01)
they they can do 10 million easy yeah (22:58 - 23:03)
and coast (23:01 - 23:06)
i mean i mean there have been other big (23:03 - 23:07)
banner years (23:06 - 23:10)
too like 2012 (23:07 - 23:13)
had a bunch of things that came out in (23:10 - 23:14)
it (23:13 - 23:17)
it had uh (23:14 - 23:19)
in a pokemon conquest it had black and (23:17 - 23:21)
white two it had (23:19 - 23:24)
polka part two like they have loaded up (23:21 - 23:26)
years with a number of (23:24 - 23:28)
games before that have been close (23:26 - 23:30)
together because they realize that (23:28 - 23:33)
they have separate audiences for them or (23:30 - 23:35)
that the gameplay is going to appeal to (23:33 - 23:36)
a separate (23:35 - 23:38)
group of people that you know there's (23:36 - 23:40)
always going to be pokemon fans who buy (23:38 - 23:42)
everything in like 2012 (23:40 - 23:46)
we had a lot to buy that year (23:42 - 23:46)
yeah so like it is very (23:48 - 23:54)
i still think it's very much that i mean (23:52 - 23:56)
i'm not going to say that they are going (23:54 - 23:57)
to be tied together (23:56 - 23:58)
they're the same region and that may be (23:57 - 24:02)
the only thai i hope that there's (23:58 - 24:02)
20 21. there will be something (24:03 - 24:09)
absolutely there's no way that like i i (24:06 - 24:09)
bet (24:09 - 24:11)
that in order to get arceus in the (24:09 - 24:13)
diamond and pro remakes (24:11 - 24:15)
you will need legends yeah that makes a (24:13 - 24:17)
lot like the poke flute will only be (24:15 - 24:19)
available (24:17 - 24:22)
i mean it's possible but i'm i i am not (24:19 - 24:23)
banking (24:22 - 24:25)
on it (24:23 - 24:25)
oh i i think so the other thing i want (24:26 - 24:30)
to say is i (24:28 - 24:33)
think that the date for legends if (24:30 - 24:34)
anything (24:33 - 24:38)
shows me confidence because they're like (24:34 - 24:40)
right at the start of the year like it (24:38 - 24:42)
like they said early (24:40 - 24:43)
if they needed more time they would have (24:42 - 24:45)
delayed they would not delayed it but (24:43 - 24:45)
they (24:45 - 24:48)
like what q1 is what till the end of (24:45 - 24:49)
march (24:48 - 24:51)
well it depends on your company and when (24:49 - 24:53)
they do their financial years but they (24:51 - 24:54)
also generally earn early (24:53 - 24:56)
so i don't know most people maybe (24:54 - 24:58)
consider april still early in the year (24:56 - 25:02)
it's not early (24:58 - 25:04)
but yeah i mean early 20 so early mean (25:02 - 25:05)
q1 (25:04 - 25:08)
like late q1 is march early q1 is (25:05 - 25:11)
january middle q1 is february if you (25:08 - 25:12)
consider the first three months of the (25:11 - 25:16)
year your first quarter (25:12 - 25:16)
i i think it'll all be fine i mean like (25:18 - 25:22)
i also (25:20 - 25:26)
i don't get i honestly don't understand (25:22 - 25:28)
how people are reading bad out of these (25:26 - 25:30)
dates (25:28 - 25:32)
well i just like there's there's a (25:30 - 25:34)
thought to me that there's just not (25:32 - 25:35)
going to be enough content (25:34 - 25:38)
in the diamond and pearl remakes to (25:35 - 25:40)
last more than two months and they're (25:38 - 25:41)
like all right we both got a bit of them (25:40 - 25:42)
something (25:41 - 25:44)
fast so that they don't lose interest in (25:42 - 25:47)
pokemon i think diamond and pearl is the (25:44 - 25:49)
longer the game you keep going back to (25:47 - 25:50)
because (25:49 - 25:52)
legends is a single player game with no (25:50 - 25:53)
like there's no competitive there's no (25:52 - 25:55)
training there's no (25:53 - 25:56)
so right there's people who are going to (25:55 - 25:58)
do the story of diamond and pearl and (25:56 - 25:59)
put it down (25:58 - 26:01)
and maybe like they're saying like it's (25:59 - 26:02)
a two-month story and now (26:01 - 26:04)
they switch over to legends and then (26:02 - 26:05)
they've still got them roped in for (26:04 - 26:07)
another month or two (26:05 - 26:10)
where like our competitive folks and our (26:07 - 26:11)
completionists (26:10 - 26:14)
and all of that biz will stay engaged (26:11 - 26:16)
with diamond and pearl no matter what (26:14 - 26:16)
and then (26:16 - 26:19)
legends will be you know one more (26:16 - 26:20)
15-minute (26:19 - 26:24)
daily chore task do we think competitive (26:20 - 26:27)
is moving to diamond and pearl (26:24 - 26:30)
oh absolutely because they want to solve (26:27 - 26:31)
it has to right they want to sell those (26:30 - 26:34)
copies to those people (26:31 - 26:37)
i mean it's through a different company (26:34 - 26:40)
yeah (26:37 - 26:43)
i i i don't know i don't i i honestly (26:40 - 26:45)
don't know if competitive is going to (26:43 - 26:47)
move to diamond and pearl (26:45 - 26:50)
i don't know i'm not sold on that (26:47 - 26:52)
happening i think diamond and pearl (26:50 - 26:54)
are just remakes and they're keeping the (26:52 - 26:56)
competitive scene in sword and shield (26:54 - 26:59)
that would be the longest probably that (26:56 - 27:00)
any game has (26:59 - 27:05)
ever been on the competitive platform (27:00 - 27:05)
because because if they move competitive (27:05 - 27:10)
to diamond and pearl (27:08 - 27:12)
then if that is the case then are they (27:10 - 27:14)
moving (27:12 - 27:17)
dynamaxx to diamond and pearl post game (27:14 - 27:20)
maybe like there's a lot that has to go (27:17 - 27:21)
in that's currently in the competitive (27:20 - 27:23)
scene that has to go into these games (27:21 - 27:24)
they've they've gotten rid of (27:23 - 27:26)
stuff they got rid of mega evolutions (27:24 - 27:27)
and competitive (27:26 - 27:30)
i mean they they kept megas and let's go (27:27 - 27:31)
peach let's go eevee (27:30 - 27:33)
uh i mean you accessed it after you beat (27:31 - 27:35)
the game (27:33 - 27:38)
so i don't see why they i mean dynamaxx (27:35 - 27:41)
unlike megas or unlike z moves you just (27:38 - 27:43)
can't dynamax on a route (27:41 - 27:45)
you can't you could z move or mega and (27:43 - 27:47)
every wild caterpie you saw if you (27:45 - 27:49)
really wanted to you could (27:47 - 27:51)
do that every time so i don't think (27:49 - 27:52)
that's too (27:51 - 27:54)
hard for them to be like okay dynamaxx (27:52 - 27:56)
is in this game (27:54 - 27:59)
and it's when you beat the game and it's (27:56 - 27:59)
only (27:59 - 28:03)
in you know free play or uh versus or (27:59 - 28:04)
ladder (28:03 - 28:06)
um or battle tower i think that's i i (28:04 - 28:08)
think that's fine i think that's easy (28:06 - 28:10)
um and laura i mean lore wise none of (28:08 - 28:12)
this matters they did omega ruby alpha (28:10 - 28:13)
sapphire and they threw it all out the (28:12 - 28:14)
window there so like (28:13 - 28:18)
like i don't like the the the concept of (28:14 - 28:20)
dynamics is only exclusive to them not (28:18 - 28:22)
only that they introduce (28:20 - 28:25)
new megas in omega ruby (28:22 - 28:27)
they just threw it all out the window (28:25 - 28:28)
that game um (28:27 - 28:31)
so they could just be like this arena (28:28 - 28:32)
here was (28:31 - 28:34)
was built by leon after you kicked his (28:32 - 28:36)
butt and he came over here and he built (28:34 - 28:38)
this arena and only this arena you can (28:36 - 28:39)
die to max in i don't that's which (28:38 - 28:41)
can i can i just pause for a moment and (28:39 - 28:43)
let's pour one out for (28:41 - 28:47)
the breeding competitive team building (28:43 - 28:48)
functionality of omega ruby alpha (28:47 - 28:50)
sapphire which i have been enjoying (28:48 - 28:53)
yeah over the past month and just (28:50 - 28:54)
rekindled that spirit of (28:53 - 28:58)
boy all i had to do was hold up on the (28:54 - 29:00)
ride my bike around that island to hatch (28:58 - 29:01)
eggs and it was like (29:00 - 29:04)
so thoughtless and beautiful and perfect (29:01 - 29:08)
and oh powers and heck yeah (29:04 - 29:12)
bring back o powers my (29:08 - 29:16)
personal not complaint is i'm not one of (29:12 - 29:17)
those people that play through the story (29:16 - 29:21)
and then put it down i used to be (29:17 - 29:24)
um so i feel like (29:21 - 29:28)
uh as a as a gamer oh (29:24 - 29:30)
i feel like there's already too many (29:28 - 29:31)
games coming out too fast (29:30 - 29:34)
yes agree yeah and so that's my that's (29:31 - 29:37)
not really a complaint it's just like (29:34 - 29:38)
oh i feel like there's not enough (29:37 - 29:40)
breathing room because i know (29:38 - 29:42)
i'm going to be playing a lot of diamond (29:40 - 29:44)
and pearl i mean (29:42 - 29:48)
diamond in pearl is the 19th the new (29:44 - 29:52)
final fantasy 14 expansion's the 23rd (29:48 - 29:55)
of november and then like (29:52 - 29:56)
there's a lot of games that are (29:55 - 29:58)
competing for time i i (29:56 - 30:00)
agree there i would like more breathing (29:58 - 30:02)
room but that is a me problem (30:00 - 30:04)
yeah right that company that company (30:02 - 30:06)
does it deliberately to (30:04 - 30:08)
make me have to do these things right (30:06 - 30:11)
like who do you love more (30:08 - 30:11)
monster hunter (30:12 - 30:17)
[Laughter] (30:13 - 30:17)
all right before we take a break let's (30:21 - 30:24)
just talk about this pokemon home news (30:22 - 30:25)
real quick they did (30:24 - 30:27)
acknowledge that pokemon home is a (30:25 - 30:29)
product that exists (30:27 - 30:32)
uh we're on year two of it i believe we (30:29 - 30:33)
all paid our (30:32 - 30:36)
16 twice at this point (30:33 - 30:37)
i'm going to do it again that's the (30:36 - 30:39)
thing i know i'm going to do it again (30:37 - 30:42)
because i don't want to deal with my (30:39 - 30:43)
i don't want to deal with having to pull (30:42 - 30:45)
things out by losing the storage (30:43 - 30:49)
a new update in a new update users will (30:45 - 30:50)
be introduced the (30:49 - 30:54)
the catch calendar this feature enables (30:50 - 30:56)
users to view their pokemon arranged by (30:54 - 30:58)
the dates they caught (30:56 - 31:01)
trainers can use this feature to relive (30:58 - 31:04)
memories from their adventures such as (31:01 - 31:05)
the day they caught their (31:04 - 31:07)
uh a certain pokemon or on a day an (31:05 - 31:10)
event or other occasion occurred or when (31:07 - 31:11)
they received the pokemon (31:10 - 31:14)
as a gift this update also introduces (31:11 - 31:15)
the ability (31:14 - 31:17)
to view pokemon registered in the (31:15 - 31:19)
pokedex in pokemon home from different (31:17 - 31:20)
angles (31:19 - 31:22)
such as above and behind trainers can (31:20 - 31:24)
get a better look (31:22 - 31:25)
trainers can try this out to get a (31:24 - 31:27)
better look of their pokemon (31:25 - 31:29)
it doesn't say this in the press release (31:27 - 31:31)
but they specifically said i think it (31:29 - 31:33)
was on pokemon.com (31:31 - 31:35)
uh or maybe it was in the emailed press (31:33 - 31:37)
release that it was a (31:35 - 31:40)
mobile update so (31:37 - 31:43)
i think well pokemon home is a mobile (31:40 - 31:45)
game (31:43 - 31:49)
well game is a weird word (31:45 - 31:52)
and yes i would say it's a mobile app (31:49 - 31:54)
um but the switch version is the one (31:52 - 31:56)
that's lacking the switch version is the (31:54 - 31:57)
one that like (31:56 - 32:00)
you can't even so when i'm like deleting (31:57 - 32:02)
pokemon (32:00 - 32:05)
um on twitch like i we're like catching (32:02 - 32:07)
a bunch of pokemon or we're like shiny (32:05 - 32:08)
hunting or whatever and i'm like or i'm (32:07 - 32:09)
breeding (32:08 - 32:12)
and i'm deleting people are always like (32:09 - 32:13)
oh why don't you just move them to home (32:12 - 32:14)
to mass delete (32:13 - 32:17)
and it's like i can't even see ribbons (32:14 - 32:19)
and marks (32:17 - 32:21)
in the switch version of home so i if (32:19 - 32:23)
i'm deleting them i have to like check (32:21 - 32:24)
them beforehand (32:23 - 32:26)
and if i'm already going through the (32:24 - 32:28)
sword and shield and i'm checking them (32:26 - 32:30)
and i'm seeing they don't have a mark or (32:28 - 32:33)
that this was one i wanted to keep (32:30 - 32:35)
i'm just going to delete it right there (32:33 - 32:36)
it's not that much slower (32:35 - 32:40)
but that that's like why why (32:36 - 32:42)
marks have ribbons have been around (32:40 - 32:44)
since generation (32:42 - 32:48)
three how can i not see them in the (32:44 - 32:50)
switch version of home (32:48 - 32:54)
i don't i don't get it i understand it (32:50 - 32:55)
but it doesn't sound like that that's (32:54 - 32:57)
getting an update i think they can catch (32:55 - 32:58)
calendar cool (32:57 - 33:00)
be able to see that like i like that a (32:58 - 33:02)
lot yeah which pokemon i caught (33:00 - 33:05)
first i can see which pokemon i caught i (33:02 - 33:07)
don't know on christmas i guess (33:05 - 33:10)
um i'll forever be reminded that my (33:07 - 33:11)
maghirna which i was supposed to get out (33:10 - 33:13)
on christmas i got an hour late so it (33:11 - 33:15)
ended up being on boxing day (33:13 - 33:18)
uh worthless throw it over just discard (33:15 - 33:18)
it (33:18 - 33:20)
release it i mean you should just check (33:18 - 33:22)
it and wait for another year you should (33:20 - 33:23)
just like get back (33:22 - 33:27)
no i'll wait until christmas next year (33:23 - 33:27)
it's been a real bummer um you should (33:27 - 33:33)
have done it like christmas eve (33:31 - 33:36)
yeah i don't yeah i really dropped the (33:33 - 33:37)
ball (33:36 - 33:40)
i forgot it was uh gmt (33:37 - 33:44)
yes yes (33:40 - 33:44)
a home de update sounds like it would be (33:45 - 33:48)
something cool (33:47 - 33:50)
like oh they're fixing it they're adding (33:48 - 33:52)
some stuff and they're like it's like (33:50 - 33:53)
yeah i mean (33:52 - 33:56)
like these two things are like they're (33:53 - 33:57)
fine (33:56 - 33:58)
i don't think they're ever going to (33:57 - 34:00)
convince somebody to spend 16 (33:58 - 34:03)
though like oh finally they ended the (34:00 - 34:06)
catch calendar time to pony it like (34:03 - 34:08)
who do they have like two people working (34:06 - 34:10)
on this and this is what they spent the (34:08 - 34:11)
last like eight months doing is like (34:10 - 34:13)
why would you need more than two people (34:11 - 34:14)
yeah you need we need one (34:13 - 34:16)
person to cover one person do the work (34:14 - 34:18)
the other one's covering their vacations (34:16 - 34:22)
yes that's all you need i mean i (34:18 - 34:25)
i don't know why they won't (34:22 - 34:27)
do things to the switch version and only (34:25 - 34:28)
the mobile version i mean i think (34:27 - 34:32)
technically the mobile version (34:28 - 34:32)
connects to more things right like it (34:32 - 34:35)
does (34:34 - 34:39)
yeah go and stuff so i i understand that (34:35 - 34:40)
if they're going to make changes they're (34:39 - 34:41)
going to make changes to (34:40 - 34:44)
that one i just don't know why they (34:41 - 34:45)
don't then just (34:44 - 34:48)
carry it over to the switch version like (34:45 - 34:52)
just bring it over just (34:48 - 34:55)
make the connection but like the (34:52 - 34:58)
catching thing (34:55 - 34:58)
makes morse makes sense because (34:59 - 35:07)
of go to me than the original games (35:02 - 35:09)
like i've been playing go steadily for (35:07 - 35:11)
what five years now so i have like (35:09 - 35:13)
a huge swath of time i remember when i (35:11 - 35:15)
played emerald and put it back down (35:13 - 35:16)
again because i don't reset my (35:15 - 35:19)
games like i play those for a very (35:16 - 35:22)
specific period of time whereas go is a (35:19 - 35:23)
huge (35:22 - 35:25)
in a continuing swath of time well i (35:23 - 35:27)
mean the underlying current here (35:25 - 35:30)
is that pokemon home is designed for (35:27 - 35:31)
pokemon go players (35:30 - 35:35)
first and everybody else next yeah gosh (35:31 - 35:36)
i wish it was (35:35 - 35:39)
i still hate (35:36 - 35:42)
hate's a strong word i still hate (35:39 - 35:44)
looking at my pokemon at home (35:42 - 35:46)
it's just there's something about it (35:44 - 35:47)
that that's why there's an update you (35:46 - 35:49)
can look at them from the top from the (35:47 - 35:50)
side from the bottom (35:49 - 35:54)
all the angles i don't know what niantic (35:50 - 35:54)
did (35:54 - 35:57)
compared to ilka but scrolling through (35:54 - 35:58)
my (35:57 - 36:01)
3 000 pokemon in go is a much (35:58 - 36:04)
more enjoyable enjoyable experience than (36:01 - 36:06)
scrolling through my 4 000 pokemon in (36:04 - 36:07)
home (36:06 - 36:11)
like it's just smoother it looks better (36:07 - 36:13)
like the information i feel like is just (36:11 - 36:15)
conveyed (36:13 - 36:16)
better i don't know how to explain it (36:15 - 36:19)
it's just (36:16 - 36:19)
you know it's like playing a it's like (36:19 - 36:22)
playing a game that's (36:21 - 36:24)
a video game that's like really good (36:22 - 36:26)
except your character movement is like (36:24 - 36:28)
slightly off like have you ever played (36:26 - 36:30)
like a an adventure game (36:28 - 36:31)
where when you're running and everything (36:30 - 36:34)
it feels great and then you stop running (36:31 - 36:35)
and your character takes this weird like (36:34 - 36:37)
extra step (36:35 - 36:39)
after you've stopped moving and you're (36:37 - 36:41)
like don't (36:39 - 36:41)
is this from a specific game is this a (36:42 - 36:46)
thing that (36:44 - 36:49)
uh like the witcher had it monster (36:46 - 36:51)
hunter rise kind of has it (36:49 - 36:52)
they have like this weird step thing (36:51 - 36:53)
where if you try to move a little bit (36:52 - 36:55)
your character takes too many steps i (36:53 - 36:55)
don't know (36:55 - 36:59)
it just what i'm saying it just feels (36:55 - 36:59)
i wish the home viewing pokemon (37:00 - 37:04)
interface was (37:03 - 37:06)
more similar to go because i like that (37:04 - 37:08)
interface better (37:06 - 37:12)
what about goes interfaces missing from (37:08 - 37:12)
home (37:21 - 37:25)
that's some deep thoughts (37:22 - 37:25)
can't even put it towards it just feels (37:32 - 37:38)
bad like using the app (37:35 - 37:41)
just doesn't it it feels (37:38 - 37:44)
like a knockoff like something's not (37:41 - 37:45)
there (37:44 - 37:47)
but what's not there what is what (37:45 - 37:52)
bothers you about it (37:47 - 37:55)
like what is it what is it (37:52 - 37:59)
everything like what like the scrolling (37:55 - 38:00)
up and down (37:59 - 38:06)
now i gotta open it like too slow is it (38:00 - 38:07)
i mean for me it's the colors i don't (38:06 - 38:09)
like that color of (38:07 - 38:11)
aquamarine green whatever it is in the (38:09 - 38:14)
background (38:11 - 38:14)
i don't even think i have pokemon home (38:18 - 38:22)
installed on my phone (38:19 - 38:22)
yeah like when i'm looking at like all (38:26 - 38:30)
pokemon (38:28 - 38:30)
it's just (38:31 - 38:34)
maybe it's the grid thing they got (38:35 - 38:39)
rotating in the background (38:37 - 38:40)
is it the background that's what i'm (38:39 - 38:42)
saying it's the colors (38:40 - 38:44)
when i'm when i'm legit scrolling it (38:42 - 38:45)
feels awful (38:44 - 38:48)
like it's it's so it's so choppy yeah (38:45 - 38:51)
no i agree it's not it's not as smooth (38:48 - 38:52)
as how it goes (38:51 - 38:54)
choppy and then the second what do you (38:52 - 38:56)
mean how is it chopped steve hasn't (38:54 - 38:57)
gotten a new phone in like (38:56 - 39:00)
18 years so 12 mini (38:57 - 39:03)
look if pokemon pokemon go is as much (39:00 - 39:04)
smoother experience and then when you (39:03 - 39:06)
tap on a pokemon (39:04 - 39:08)
that's all it looks bad i don't know (39:06 - 39:10)
everything about it is bad (39:08 - 39:13)
none of this matters i am deeply (39:10 - 39:14)
confused (39:13 - 39:17)
because when i'm scrolling through (39:14 - 39:21)
go with the same three across (39:17 - 39:25)
go is slower than home my goal is (39:21 - 39:28)
not slow at all also go this looks (39:25 - 39:28)
better (39:28 - 39:32)
go looks better like colors are better (39:28 - 39:34)
the pokemon are like smaller and then (39:32 - 39:37)
the names are like more bold (39:34 - 39:41)
because they had to fit the cp above (39:37 - 39:43)
yeah i don't know but i feel like they (39:41 - 39:44)
could put more information (39:43 - 39:46)
like they could put something above the (39:44 - 39:48)
pokemon names to make it like what i (39:46 - 39:48)
think (39:48 - 39:53)
i think go feels better yes i agree (39:48 - 39:53)
in what way (39:53 - 39:56)
when we are in person greg we will (39:57 - 40:01)
thoroughly go through this and report (39:59 - 40:01)
back (40:01 - 40:04)
because like i (40:01 - 40:07)
the only difference the only difference (40:04 - 40:09)
is the background (40:07 - 40:09)
yeah we're gonna do this in person (40:10 - 40:13)
because okay you are (40:11 - 40:16)
you are out of your gourd (40:13 - 40:19)
but i agree with him so two of us agree (40:16 - 40:20)
and one of us doesn't (40:19 - 40:22)
who's out of their actual gourd both of (40:20 - 40:25)
you you've taken the pill (40:22 - 40:28)
taking the go pill all right we need to (40:25 - 40:30)
take a break (40:28 - 40:33)
we will be right back (40:30 - 40:33)
tricks lucky charms coco puffs (40:34 - 40:39)
[Music] (40:47 - 40:54)
flavor (40:51 - 40:54)
[Music] (41:05 - 41:19)
sounds nice (41:26 - 41:37)
oh my gosh (41:35 - 41:40)
[Music] (41:37 - 41:40)
and we are back from our break (41:40 - 41:48)
uh we forgot to mention in the thrilling (41:45 - 41:49)
pokemon home news (41:48 - 41:53)
that you will be getting a bulbasaur and (41:49 - 41:54)
a squirtle (41:53 - 41:59)
capable of giganta maxing this june (41:54 - 41:59)
that that's it but what (42:01 - 42:07)
did say those words together to get them (42:04 - 42:08)
in game (42:07 - 42:10)
like well you only got one of them yeah (42:08 - 42:11)
okay (42:10 - 42:15)
you can give them soup yeah you're right (42:11 - 42:17)
yes well i mean how there's only so much (42:15 - 42:19)
soup in the world (42:17 - 42:21)
there's a lot of soup in that game there (42:19 - 42:22)
are mushrooms everywhere you can make (42:21 - 42:24)
soup for days (42:22 - 42:28)

squirtle and bulbasaur get them while (42:32 - 42:35)
they're getting look (42:35 - 42:37)
i think it's just to balance out the (42:35 - 42:38)
charmanders (42:37 - 42:40)
no balancing out the charmanders at this (42:38 - 42:43)
point charander has gone too powerful (42:40 - 42:47)
it has taken over there's actually (42:43 - 42:49)
a card fight vanguard card that came out (42:47 - 42:50)
in the new set that (42:49 - 42:53)
is almost spelled like charizard and i (42:50 - 42:54)
was like are you (42:53 - 42:56)
serious it's time to start the crazy car (42:54 - 42:59)
the card is called velocihazard but if (42:56 - 43:00)

viper and (49:27 - 49:31)
zangoose they're the bouncers (49:29 - 49:35)
sorry that's the music festival um last (49:31 - 49:37)
year was heat more endurant (49:35 - 49:38)
because it was the first time they shoot (49:37 - 49:40)
the heat more endurant the year before (49:38 - 49:42)
that was the viper and zangoose i think (49:40 - 49:44)
these are just the two rival pokemon (49:42 - 49:45)
it's just their time yeah and they're (49:44 - 49:48)
the bouncers at the concert so they will (49:45 - 49:51)
sock you and throw you out maybe it's (49:48 - 49:54)
like the thing of rocky (49:51 - 49:56)
where they're going up the stairs what (49:54 - 49:58)
does it have to do with music (49:56 - 50:01)
cause it's the song no no x (49:58 - 50:03)
no forbidden i don't know what this is (50:01 - 50:05)
is it i have the tiger get out of it no (50:03 - 50:08)
get out of here done no (50:05 - 50:11)
it's the i have done we don't wanna be (50:08 - 50:12)
dmcad (50:11 - 50:15)
uh there's a wireless in the photo (50:12 - 50:18)
evolution of dyno yes (50:15 - 50:22)
this is approved why what is the (50:18 - 50:23)
significance of (50:22 - 50:26)
f and g although i mean obviously are (50:23 - 50:29)
two notes yes but there's other notes (50:26 - 50:34)
a b c d e f and s c being the prime one (50:29 - 50:37)
yeah typically or uh (50:34 - 50:41)
g c treble clef is (50:37 - 50:45)
g no hmm (50:41 - 50:45)
boy it's been a while since i looked at (50:45 - 50:50)
one of those things (50:47 - 50:50)
it's the eye of the time no (50:50 - 50:56)
that was not rocky one okay so rocky one (50:53 - 50:58)
is where he's running up the stairs that (50:56 - 51:00)
was a completely different song it was (50:58 - 51:03)
not eye of the tiger so get out of here (51:00 - 51:04)
that was like i had the tiger was like (51:03 - 51:06)
rocky three or rocky iv okay (51:04 - 51:10)
so when it got real real bad (51:06 - 51:13)
i think so okay so (51:10 - 51:15)
i i know what's already gonna happen in (51:13 - 51:17)
a year people are gonna complain that (51:15 - 51:18)
it's not 4.99 (51:17 - 51:21)
i think niantic did a pretty good job (51:18 - 51:23)
like letting you know that it was 14.99 (51:21 - 51:25)
originally and they strike through the (51:23 - 51:27)
price and they're like it's five (51:25 - 51:29)
five dollars five dollars for five years (51:27 - 51:31)
five dollars for five years yeah (51:29 - 51:34)
but i'm already like uh next year (51:31 - 51:35)
they're gonna be like (51:34 - 51:37)
well last year was five dollars and then (51:35 - 51:38)
there was better (51:37 - 51:40)
than this let's not worry about feature (51:38 - 51:42)
complaints we make next year we'll be (51:40 - 51:46)
in person too right yeah (51:42 - 51:48)
so of course we're not even touching on (51:46 - 51:50)
how (51:48 - 51:52)
inconsiderate they are with those dates (51:50 - 51:53)
look that's (51:52 - 51:54)
i was waiting for you to get to this (51:53 - 51:56)
wait what are those dates (51:54 - 52:00)
those dates are twin cities pride (51:56 - 52:02)
it's the same weekend as twin cities (52:00 - 52:03)
pride weekend which (52:02 - 52:05)
why the twin cities are having pride in (52:03 - 52:06)
july i know (52:05 - 52:08)
they had to push it back because of the (52:06 - 52:10)
whole everything right (52:08 - 52:12)
like it had to be pushed back but they (52:10 - 52:13)
should have checked in (52:12 - 52:16)
with the contingency in minnesota (52:13 - 52:19)
and verified those dates and the fact (52:16 - 52:20)
that they didn't (52:19 - 52:24)
means they are bad people maybe (52:20 - 52:25)
they just wanted to make sure mall (52:24 - 52:28)
america was loaded for pride (52:25 - 52:31)
we are not going to mall of america (52:28 - 52:34)
if we can be outside but mom america has (52:31 - 52:37)
air conditioning (52:34 - 52:37)
no it doesn't yeah we can be outside and (52:38 - 52:41)
actually it doesn't yeah it doesn't have (52:39 - 52:42)
air conditioning (52:41 - 52:44)
i feel like it's cooler in there than it (52:42 - 52:47)
is because it's a giant cave (52:44 - 52:49)
but it doesn't have air conditioning and (52:47 - 52:51)
if there's a lot of people in there (52:49 - 52:52)
it's not going to be cool because that's (52:51 - 52:54)
the play though it's (52:52 - 52:56)
only ever the cave biome that's the (52:54 - 52:58)
problem people will be like oh it's nice (52:56 - 52:59)
outside we're going out but we (52:58 - 53:01)
do the seven million iq go to mall (52:59 - 53:03)
america where no one is (53:01 - 53:05)
look look remember the kanto tour (53:03 - 53:06)
remember (53:05 - 53:09)
our remember the mega hound we were (53:06 - 53:12)
doing raids non-stop it was great (53:09 - 53:13)
we didn't have to invite anyone we were (53:12 - 53:15)
filled 20 people instantly (53:13 - 53:20)
there are places outside (53:15 - 53:22)
that we do not have these issues with (53:20 - 53:23)
either we can go to victory memorial (53:22 - 53:24)
park (53:23 - 53:26)
where there are millions of people and (53:24 - 53:27)
you will never wait either and you can (53:26 - 53:28)
enjoy the glory of outside (53:27 - 53:32)
also it is still bad that it's on pride (53:28 - 53:33)
weekend because now you are making me (53:32 - 53:34)
choose (53:33 - 53:38)
between my two loves being gay (53:34 - 53:43)
and playing pokemon (53:38 - 53:46)
you can do both at the same time clearly (53:43 - 53:49)
because if i go to the park if i go to (53:46 - 53:50)
luring park where pride is (53:49 - 53:52)
there are literally no stops there (53:50 - 53:53)
there's like really (53:52 - 53:56)
two well they that's they should have (53:53 - 53:58)
picked a different park (53:56 - 54:01)
and or mall of america the park was the (53:58 - 54:02)
established (54:01 - 54:05)
pokemon go is the newcomer pokemon go is (54:02 - 54:06)
the new thing trying to (54:05 - 54:08)
inch its way into our pride and i say (54:06 - 54:11)
the nay i feel like (54:08 - 54:13)
walking around a pride fest and playing (54:11 - 54:14)
pogo is a pretty good (54:13 - 54:17)
experience well if there's raid (54:14 - 54:19)
locations but there won't be anything (54:17 - 54:21)
there will be yeah but we don't have to (54:19 - 54:22)
worry about raids on day one they (54:21 - 54:25)
already said raids are day two (54:22 - 54:28)
see so you're so here so so (54:25 - 54:30)
you are fine with going to the big (54:28 - 54:32)
crowded okay i'm not gonna get i'm not (54:30 - 54:34)
gonna say that it's gonna be crazy i (54:32 - 54:34)
don't know if i (54:34 - 54:37)
have no idea how it's going i don't know (54:34 - 54:38)
how it's going to be this year to be (54:37 - 54:40)
completely honest (54:38 - 54:42)
well but what about this greg what if (54:40 - 54:43)
the alternative was that they scheduled (54:42 - 54:44)
go fest (54:43 - 54:50)
for state fair state fair is 10 days (54:44 - 54:52)
they're doing an extra long no go fest (54:50 - 54:53)
this year or (54:52 - 54:56)
something every monday i will find the (54:53 - 54:57)
owner of niantic (54:56 - 54:59)
and i will make him pay because you know (54:57 - 55:02)
what the state fair does (54:59 - 55:04)
they turn off pokemon go yeah well (55:02 - 55:05)
during state fair time (55:04 - 55:07)
all of the stops in the state (55:05 - 55:08)
fairgrounds are turned off are you (55:07 - 55:11)
serious i am dead serious haters (55:08 - 55:14)
you cannot replace pokemon go at the (55:11 - 55:15)
state fair (55:14 - 55:17)
i feel like that would bring more people (55:15 - 55:19)
in like i want to go (55:17 - 55:20)
and spend some stops and eat a cream (55:19 - 55:22)
puff the problem is no (55:20 - 55:24)
at the state fair which i've never been (55:22 - 55:26)
to in all my years of living in (55:24 - 55:26)
minnesota (55:26 - 55:28)
you haven't even left your house while (55:26 - 55:30)
living in minnesota but i've never (55:28 - 55:34)
entirely do house be quiet uh (55:30 - 55:36)
they they they want to keep people (55:34 - 55:37)
moving you're not supposed to stand (55:36 - 55:39)
still at the state fair you got to keep (55:37 - 55:41)
moving keep it going keep it going keep (55:39 - 55:42)
moving keep eating keep looking at all (55:41 - 55:43)
the stuff (55:42 - 55:45)
i am very excited for the safe here but (55:43 - 55:46)
yes the first (55:45 - 55:51)
year ago was out all the stops were on (55:46 - 55:53)
and then it became such a huge problem (55:51 - 55:54)
that (55:53 - 55:57)
uh the next year they were all off (55:54 - 55:59)
and they remain off all 10 days of the (55:57 - 56:01)
state fair you cannot play (55:59 - 56:05)
go at the state fair that sounds awful (56:01 - 56:07)
it's awesome because you can focus on (56:05 - 56:08)
other things for once in your life it's (56:07 - 56:10)
a problem now though (56:08 - 56:13)
now that like i i (56:10 - 56:15)
the first year the first year yes (56:13 - 56:16)
probably was a complete disaster because (56:15 - 56:19)
that was where the still hype was go was (56:16 - 56:20)
relatively new but i feel like (56:19 - 56:23)
now yeah but that would require somebody (56:20 - 56:24)
to go and (56:23 - 56:27)
both talk to the state fair and niantic (56:24 - 56:30)
about returning go to the fair and take (56:27 - 56:31)
the risk (56:30 - 56:33)
right that take the risk that they could (56:31 - 56:36)
be right or wrong (56:33 - 56:36)
there is so much to do at the fair you (56:38 - 56:43)
will not miss go (56:41 - 56:45)
uh it is two hours shorter yep it's from (56:43 - 56:47)
ten to six last year was from ten to (56:45 - 56:49)
eight (56:47 - 56:53)
uh so (56:49 - 56:56)
a couple things two things maybe this is (56:53 - 56:56)
the whole (56:56 - 56:58)
our podcast should just be named two (56:56 - 57:01)
things uh first thing is (56:58 - 57:05)
that they didn't say that there's a (57:01 - 57:07)
location this year this probably would (57:05 - 57:08)
have been the time to say we're doing an (57:07 - 57:11)
event i don't i think that ship has (57:08 - 57:11)
sailed (57:11 - 57:13)
probably for the best that's fine i (57:11 - 57:14)
don't think anyone's super upset about (57:13 - 57:15)
that (57:14 - 57:19)
um number two is they they did (57:15 - 57:23)
cut two hours off some people (57:19 - 57:26)
were like last year was exhausting (57:23 - 57:29)
because it was (57:26 - 57:29)
10 hours i mean you guys were pretty (57:30 - 57:35)
exhausted for canto tour yep (57:32 - 57:38)
uh but the counter argument was no one's (57:35 - 57:39)
forcing you to start (57:38 - 57:41)
at 10 no one's forcing you to i'm going (57:39 - 57:44)
to point out as a counter example (57:41 - 57:46)
of why this is a deliberate attack on (57:44 - 57:48)
twin cities pride (57:46 - 57:51)
the hours of twin cities pride are from (57:48 - 57:52)
10 a.m (57:51 - 57:56)
to 6 p.m both saturday and sunday (57:52 - 57:59)
this is a deliberate attack on (57:56 - 58:03)
my people my life (57:59 - 58:05)
the exact same times they shortened it (58:03 - 58:06)
they shortened it (58:05 - 58:10)
to match ex this is a conspiracy (58:06 - 58:14)
they shortened to go to the exact times (58:10 - 58:16)
the twin cities pride (58:14 - 58:20)
it's unacceptable uh counter argument is (58:16 - 58:21)
you don't have to play till eight you (58:20 - 58:23)
didn't have to start at 10. (58:21 - 58:27)
some people i play with you i have to (58:23 - 58:28)
start at 10 (58:27 - 58:31)
and i have to finish at 6. yes we have (58:28 - 58:32)
to do the whole thing (58:31 - 58:36)
there is not there is nothing but (58:32 - 58:39)
mega hound doom screaming and scorn (58:36 - 58:43)
if we don't do the entire time with you (58:39 - 58:43)
i mean i am probably going to pick a (58:43 - 58:48)
different mega for this event i don't (58:47 - 58:50)
know if houndhood's making the cut this (58:48 - 58:51)
summer (58:50 - 58:52)
we might run another one are you gonna (58:51 - 58:54)
pick there's no musical mega (58:52 - 58:58)
currently in the game uh i guess (58:54 - 58:59)
we don't know what's coming back to (58:58 - 59:01)
raids i'm maybe assuming they're gonna (58:59 - 59:03)
do dialga and palkia for raids (59:01 - 59:06)
they're not musical yeah but they did (59:03 - 59:07)
growled on kyogre (59:06 - 59:10)
last year it's gonna be that was weather (59:07 - 59:11)
yeah it's gonna be (59:10 - 59:14)
the weather theme last year uh (59:11 - 59:16)
no i think they're gonna use this i i (59:14 - 59:17)
think because groudon (59:16 - 59:21)
and kyogre did so well last year (59:17 - 59:23)
this is the opportunity to bring (59:21 - 59:24)
dialogue and palkia because they already (59:23 - 59:26)
announced diamond and pearl (59:24 - 59:29)
they're gonna milk all of those people (59:26 - 59:30)
because they're (59:29 - 59:32)
dying to get these legends you know what (59:30 - 59:33)
they should do (59:32 - 59:35)
to make up for their and if that's the (59:33 - 59:37)
case i'm going to bring (59:35 - 59:39)
like mega altaria or mega ampros because (59:37 - 59:41)
i want the dragon boost (59:39 - 59:45)
they need to put xerneas into the raids (59:41 - 59:47)
to make up for their attack on pride (59:45 - 59:50)
they need to put the pride deer in (59:47 - 59:54)
raids along with the alga and pelican (59:50 - 59:56)
what if it's dialga palkia xerneas and (59:54 - 59:57)
develtol (59:56 - 60:00)
i'm in i don't think they're going to (59:57 - 60:01)
turn those china yet (60:00 - 60:03)
i didn't say they would make them shiny (60:01 - 60:05)
they're not good (60:03 - 60:06)
they want to make money they're not (60:05 - 60:08)
going to put non-shiny evita (60:06 - 60:10)
right now again i already have a certain (60:08 - 60:11)
bacon bird (60:10 - 60:14)
zertius was here for like a week bring (60:11 - 60:15)
it back for pride (60:14 - 60:16)
you're already ruining my pride xerneas (60:15 - 60:18)
had two weeks (60:16 - 60:22)
whatever i i think the hour cut (60:18 - 60:24)
is fine i know some people are upset (60:22 - 60:25)
that they're losing two hours but i (60:24 - 60:27)
think it's fine because (60:25 - 60:30)
when they return to go fest next year (60:27 - 60:31)
which will be a thing (60:30 - 60:33)
that will be the normal time right from (60:31 - 60:35)
ten to six is (60:33 - 60:37)
i mean they did cut off like ten dollars (60:35 - 60:38)
so (60:37 - 60:40)
yeah and that's i mean you're paying for (60:38 - 60:41)
an abbreviated experience (60:40 - 60:44)
like if it was 14 if they didn't cut the (60:41 - 60:45)
time (60:44 - 60:47)
this year then next year they would have (60:45 - 60:49)
been 15 and were cutting the time to (60:47 - 60:50)
match with the people (60:49 - 60:51)
in the in-person event and then people (60:50 - 60:53)
would have been like oh well it's (60:51 - 60:55)
two less hours and you're giving me (60:53 - 60:57)
you're making me pay i think this (60:55 - 61:00)
like it's it's a lose-lose yep (60:57 - 61:04)
but this was whatever they that's fine (61:00 - 61:08)
like the the super super hardcore people (61:04 - 61:08)
that (61:08 - 61:10)
want their two extra hours to grind out (61:08 - 61:13)
candy are going to be very vocal (61:10 - 61:16)
but eight hours of pogo two and two (61:13 - 61:19)
16 hours of pogo in a weekend ideally (61:16 - 61:21)
hopefully with your friends (61:19 - 61:23)
and then you can get dinner put your (61:21 - 61:24)
feet up (61:23 - 61:26)
rest for the next day i don't know it (61:24 - 61:27)
sounds awesome to me (61:26 - 61:29)
it sounds like a good time i'm very (61:27 - 61:31)
excited whether this event was (61:29 - 61:35)
5 or 15 i would have purchased it (61:31 - 61:38)
but i would assume one if you're (61:35 - 61:40)
listening to this podcast and you play (61:38 - 61:41)
pogo i think it's probably a no-brainer (61:40 - 61:43)
that you're gonna buy this (61:41 - 61:46)
um if you play pogo even 10 minutes (61:43 - 61:46)
every day (61:46 - 61:49)
i don't see why you wouldn't buy this (61:46 - 61:50)
the only (61:49 - 61:52)
maybe like if you play poke like if you (61:50 - 61:54)
play pogo like twice a year (61:52 - 61:58)
yeah easy pass probably for you um (61:54 - 62:00)
and if you work that weekend yeah (61:58 - 62:02)
probably easy pass for you but (62:00 - 62:05)
if you're playing pogo i don't see why (62:02 - 62:07)
you don't just spend the five bucks (62:05 - 62:09)
right like i i totally understand (62:07 - 62:10)
there's free to play players and they (62:09 - 62:11)
they love to brag how they've never (62:10 - 62:13)
spent money (62:11 - 62:16)
ever on this game and how they they (62:13 - 62:17)
spend (62:16 - 62:19)
you know five hours in their car every (62:17 - 62:21)
evening idling to take out gyms to get (62:19 - 62:23)
their free 50 pokey coins so they can (62:21 - 62:24)
buy more storage i'm sure those people (62:23 - 62:27)
exist but (62:24 - 62:28)
if you got time to idle at your gym to (62:27 - 62:30)
get 50 coins every day just spend the (62:28 - 62:33)
five dollars i don't (62:30 - 62:34)
who would not be spending the five (62:33 - 62:36)
dollars it's just it feels like a (62:34 - 62:37)
no-brainer (62:36 - 62:40)
it feels good i mean pride is pride and (62:37 - 62:41)
not (62:40 - 62:43)
greg's pride i mean pride of i didn't (62:41 - 62:45)
give this game any money (62:43 - 62:48)
so it's like i in five years i haven't (62:45 - 62:50)
spent a cent on pokemon go (62:48 - 62:51)
after five years it's not going to (62:50 - 62:53)
change (62:51 - 62:53)
and that's a valid stance and i support (62:54 - 62:58)
that 100 (62:56 - 63:00)
oh speaking of events there was that (62:58 - 63:02)
verizon event this weekend (63:00 - 63:04)
uh yeah but none of us subscribed to (63:02 - 63:07)
verizon so so (63:04 - 63:10)
actually it was verizon mexican 7-eleven (63:07 - 63:11)
and (63:10 - 63:13)
yashinoko there were three different (63:11 - 63:14)
companies (63:13 - 63:16)
dang will with the the hot knowledge i (63:14 - 63:18)
was gonna follow because i got the news (63:16 - 63:19)
item today (63:18 - 63:23)
right after the event is half over okay (63:19 - 63:27)
so i normally go to my friend tim he's (63:23 - 63:28)
on verizon (63:27 - 63:31)
and he's got me codes before and he was (63:28 - 63:33)
saying the app wasn't working (63:31 - 63:36)
and i saw in the discord uh that people (63:33 - 63:38)
also with verizon they couldn't get the (63:36 - 63:38)
app to (63:38 - 63:42)
load so i was running out of time (63:38 - 63:46)
so i did the unfortunate thing of going (63:42 - 63:48)
to ebay (63:46 - 63:49)
and seeing how much people were charging (63:48 - 63:52)
and people were charging about 40 to 50 (63:49 - 63:55)
for this event (63:52 - 63:55)
and i was like i can't do that dude all (63:56 - 64:00)
you need to do was go on facebook (63:58 - 64:02)
because i have people (64:00 - 64:04)
on facebook who are legit like if you're (64:02 - 64:05)
on verizon (64:04 - 64:07)
but don't play pokemon go can you go to (64:05 - 64:09)
this thing and get me your code (64:07 - 64:12)
and they got like 30 codes off of it i (64:09 - 64:14)
i'm never going to go to facebook and (64:12 - 64:17)
ask for anything (64:14 - 64:17)
so i so somebody on ebay posted they had (64:17 - 64:22)
three codes and they were selling them (64:21 - 64:23)
for 25 (64:22 - 64:25)
on friday the event was saturday so i (64:23 - 64:27)
was like oh you are the ebayer i love (64:25 - 64:29)
you're undercutting everyone you want to (64:27 - 64:30)
move these products (64:29 - 64:33)
fast i'm in i'm in (64:30 - 64:36)
so i bought for 25 they sent me the code (64:33 - 64:38)
within five minutes worked perfectly (64:36 - 64:41)
flaw free that event onset the reason (64:38 - 64:44)
i'm bringing this up is because (64:41 - 64:47)
uh a bunch of people were panicking in (64:44 - 64:49)
my twitch of like whether they should or (64:47 - 64:51)
should not go to ebay to get into this (64:49 - 64:52)
event or whether they (64:51 - 64:54)
you didn't miss anything this event was (64:52 - 64:55)
not worth 25 (64:54 - 64:56)
even this event was not worth five (64:55 - 64:59)
dollars like (64:56 - 65:02)
it was you did get unknown spawn (64:59 - 65:04)
i don't think unknown v is worth 25 (65:02 - 65:06)
bucks it was like (65:04 - 65:10)
increased chance of shiny eevee (65:06 - 65:10)
two dinos i have so many shiny eevees if (65:10 - 65:14)
you're desperate for a shiny eevee just (65:12 - 65:15)
hit me up i'll get you one (65:14 - 65:18)
well i just like i knew it wasn't gonna (65:15 - 65:21)
be worth 25 (65:18 - 65:23)
but niantic's in this weird position (65:21 - 65:25)
where they have these (65:23 - 65:27)
partnered events with 7-eleven or (65:25 - 65:29)
verizon or sprint or whoever they do (65:27 - 65:31)
and they have to do this balance to make (65:29 - 65:33)
them like (65:31 - 65:36)
like good enough for the people to kind (65:33 - 65:38)
of go out and seek them out (65:36 - 65:40)
but also bad enough for people to be (65:38 - 65:41)
like oh i didn't miss (65:40 - 65:44)
anything so to anyone who missed the (65:41 - 65:46)
verizon event (65:44 - 65:49)
you didn't miss anything it like it was (65:46 - 65:52)
not like the only thing i have to (65:49 - 65:54)
remember this event is i have a little (65:52 - 65:56)
medal now in my collection that no one (65:54 - 65:57)
can see but me (65:56 - 66:02)
that says verizon (65:57 - 66:02)
so you have a sponsored medal (66:02 - 66:08)
that will constantly advertise to you (66:06 - 66:10)
that i paid money for (66:08 - 66:12)
that you paid money for yeah it's right (66:10 - 66:13)
next to my (66:12 - 66:16)
799 mr my medal (66:13 - 66:19)
basically you know i used to think bobby (66:16 - 66:20)
was the sucker (66:19 - 66:23)
yeah no i think bobby's still (66:20 - 66:25)
a bigger sucker than i am oh you know (66:23 - 66:27)
bobby did this one (66:25 - 66:29)
you know 100 bobby did this one is bobby (66:27 - 66:31)
on verizon though (66:29 - 66:35)
i don't know i'm sure he found a way (66:31 - 66:35)
do we have any other closing thoughts on (66:36 - 66:40)
gofest 2021 (66:38 - 66:44)
i'm excited for it i'm i'm happy that (66:40 - 66:47)
i should be able to actually participate (66:44 - 66:47)
in this year (66:47 - 66:50)
versus you know being in a car for eight (66:47 - 66:52)
hours (66:50 - 66:52)
are am i coming if i i don't think i am (66:52 - 66:56)
not coming to you (66:55 - 66:59)
the the there are more people here than (66:56 - 67:00)
there are in milwaukee (66:59 - 67:04)
yeah yes yes we should go to chicago why (67:00 - 67:06)
should we go to chicago you hate chicago (67:04 - 67:08)
for the authenticity (67:06 - 67:12)
yeah we gotta make it feel good memories (67:08 - 67:14)
probably get a cheap hotel right now (67:12 - 67:17)
okay if you find a cheap hotel (67:14 - 67:19)
and you come and pick me up and take me (67:17 - 67:20)
there (67:19 - 67:22)
ah it's a lot of work all right just (67:20 - 67:23)

they got flights from minnesota to (67:23 - 67:28)
chicago yeah i've taken that flight it's (67:25 - 67:28)
the (67:28 - 67:31)
it's the strangest experience ever (67:28 - 67:33)
uh yeah i don't mind going to minnesota (67:31 - 67:35)
i didn't love the victory memorial park (67:33 - 67:36)
though i didn't love it (67:35 - 67:38)
maybe because it was like no sidewalks (67:36 - 67:40)
it was just like this weird grass (67:38 - 67:42)
median that you just walked on maybe (67:40 - 67:43)
maybe uh (67:42 - 67:46)
maybe like along the river although i (67:43 - 67:47)
mean that's (67:46 - 67:49)
that's a lot that's a lot i will say i (67:47 - 67:50)

how do you defend it omega ruby and (70:38 - 70:45)
alpha sapphire no no no (70:41 - 70:45)

never played emerald i don't like ruby (70:54 - 70:57)
sapphire (70:56 - 70:59)
emerald is real good though i think (70:57 - 71:01)
omega ruby alpha sapphire is excellent (70:59 - 71:03)
emerald is my all-time favorite game i (71:01 - 71:04)
think emerald is great and there are (71:03 - 71:05)
people out there (71:04 - 71:08)
who are all who do not like any of the (71:05 - 71:10)
gen 3 games and they are very wrong (71:08 - 71:10)
people (71:10 - 71:12)
there's a heck ton that's real good (71:10 - 71:14)
about omega ruby and alpha sapphire (71:12 - 71:16)
i will say that every time i bring up (71:14 - 71:17)
omega ruby and alpha sapphire to my (71:16 - 71:19)
friend chris he complains about the fact (71:17 - 71:22)
that he had to work really hard to get (71:19 - 71:24)
wadios or ladies in the original (71:22 - 71:26)
ruby and sapphire and they kind of just (71:24 - 71:29)
gave away vladio somebody has (71:26 - 71:31)
three well they gave away one because it (71:29 - 71:32)
was no you had to work really hard you (71:31 - 71:34)
had to suffer through the beginning of (71:32 - 71:36)
that game no you just said that's you (71:34 - 71:37)
that is you (71:36 - 71:40)
that is you you are a horrible person (71:37 - 71:42)
omega ruby alpha sapphire is an amazing (71:40 - 71:44)
series of games and you do not i mean (71:42 - 71:46)
the whole point of the remakes was to (71:44 - 71:48)
fly around on ladius (71:46 - 71:50)
and soar through the skies and look at (71:48 - 71:52)
the world and as a majestic person that (71:50 - 71:53)
you (71:52 - 71:56)
are and then go to space (71:53 - 71:58)
all of that is amazing and you don't get (71:56 - 72:00)
it (71:58 - 72:04)
here's here's my hot tech greg laura's (72:00 - 72:04)
now (72:04 - 72:06)
six out of ten for me it would have (72:04 - 72:07)
instantly been an (72:06 - 72:10)
eight out of ten if you didn't have hms (72:07 - 72:11)
if they did what they did in (72:10 - 72:14)
ultrasound here's the funny thing while (72:11 - 72:15)
i've been playing it recently (72:14 - 72:18)
i like i'm obviously i was hatching eggs (72:15 - 72:20)
and i was like i need to get (72:18 - 72:21)
i need to get a flame body i need to get (72:20 - 72:23)
a magma armor i need to get something (72:21 - 72:25)
that's going to make these eggs pop (72:23 - 72:27)
faster because i don't have all morning (72:25 - 72:28)
waiting for these eggs to (72:27 - 72:32)
to come out um which that's a different (72:28 - 72:32)
story (72:32 - 72:34)
i won't even get into my complaint about (72:32 - 72:35)
egg hatching in omega ruby office high (72:34 - 72:36)
sci-fi (72:35 - 72:39)
but i completely forgot did you get that (72:36 - 72:40)
route (72:39 - 72:43)
i completely forgot that you can use the (72:40 - 72:44)
eon flute (72:43 - 72:47)
to call your ladies or your ladios to (72:44 - 72:48)
fly anywhere (72:47 - 72:49)
and i was like this is a good part of (72:48 - 72:52)
the game literally (72:49 - 72:52)
taught a zubat fly (72:53 - 72:59)
why would you do these things so i could (72:56 - 73:00)
fly (72:59 - 73:03)
over to where i could get a flame (73:00 - 73:05)
to get a numble to evolve it into a (73:03 - 73:06)
camera (73:05 - 73:09)
so i could have magma armor and then (73:06 - 73:12)
and i also forgot about blissy bases (73:09 - 73:12)
which (73:12 - 73:15)
you know and then i finally finally that (73:12 - 73:17)
clicked back into place to (73:15 - 73:19)
evolve my numbers and camera ups and get (73:17 - 73:21)
all that stuff done (73:19 - 73:24)
but boy see i thought blissey bases were (73:21 - 73:26)
were were one of the redeeming features (73:24 - 73:28)
of omega ruby off of sapphire (73:26 - 73:31)
so let me introduce you to the xl candy (73:28 - 73:33)
that you get no no i don't no candy no (73:31 - 73:35)
no artificial i'm not giving my pokemon (73:33 - 73:37)
steroids (73:35 - 73:40)
no no they learned through training but (73:37 - 73:40)
here (73:40 - 73:43)
training training training no shortcuts (73:40 - 73:44)
there is (73:43 - 73:46)
and somebody can research this and let (73:44 - 73:47)
me know (73:46 - 73:49)
because i know i'm right because i hatch (73:47 - 73:53)
a lot of eggs i hatch a lot of eggs (73:49 - 73:56)
in omega ruby and alpha sapphire (73:53 - 73:59)
the egg counter it's it has to be (73:56 - 74:02)
like it only counts the first egg (73:59 - 74:04)
unhatched egg in your party or something (74:02 - 74:07)
because it's like i like hatch one egg (74:04 - 74:08)
and then i got to go around the island (74:07 - 74:10)
three more times before the next egg and (74:08 - 74:11)
then i go to the island around three (74:10 - 74:13)
more times before the next deck and (74:11 - 74:14)
they're all ralts (74:13 - 74:16)
they should all have relatively (74:14 - 74:18)
equivalent step counters for hatching (74:16 - 74:19)
those eggs (74:18 - 74:22)
if i'm in sword and shield at the same (74:19 - 74:23)
time (74:22 - 74:25)
huh you didn't get them all at the same (74:23 - 74:26)
time no no i (74:25 - 74:28)
i picked them all up out of my computer (74:26 - 74:29)
because i've got like 200 (74:28 - 74:33)
eggs in my computer right um (74:29 - 74:35)
if i'm in sword and shield and i have (74:33 - 74:37)
five eggs in my party and they're all (74:35 - 74:40)
uh no i'm (74:37 - 74:43)
what am i what is that bug that i'm (74:40 - 74:44)
doing right now (74:43 - 74:48)
the the scorch insect the the bee (74:44 - 74:52)
bomb no no i already did rebecca no (74:48 - 74:52)
i did it was pokemon of the week like (74:53 - 74:57)
four weeks ago and we've already forgot (74:54 - 75:00)
either way when when (74:57 - 75:02)
it's a combi yes and when the first one (75:00 - 75:04)
hatches (75:02 - 75:08)
they all hatch at the same time (75:04 - 75:11)
so i don't know what they changed in egg (75:08 - 75:12)
hatching (75:11 - 75:15)
between these games but it is notable (75:12 - 75:16)
and that (75:15 - 75:20)
is annoying very true (75:16 - 75:20)
okay so i know mike what is steve what (75:22 - 75:27)
are you defending with your last breath (75:24 - 75:28)
you know honestly it'd probably be (75:27 - 75:31)
pokemon go (75:28 - 75:33)
who hates pokemon go a lot of people do (75:31 - 75:36)
yeah that's not real pokemon (75:33 - 75:38)
oh felon i don't know pokemon go just (75:36 - 75:38)
like (75:38 - 75:41)
[Laughter] (75:38 - 75:45)
it it's it's like a game that (75:41 - 75:46)
yeah i would i would just defend it it (75:45 - 75:48)
is so much of my life (75:46 - 75:49)
especially with like the last five years (75:48 - 75:53)
of you know some days i play at only 10 (75:49 - 75:54)
minutes but other days i can play it for (75:53 - 75:56)
an hour and then like the weekend you (75:54 - 75:58)
know go fest coming up i'm (75:56 - 76:00)
very excited to play for 16 hours and (75:58 - 76:02)
probably after the event is over i'll (76:00 - 76:04)
keep playing like (76:02 - 76:05)
it is just one of those games that they (76:04 - 76:07)
keep adding features to that i keep (76:05 - 76:08)
going back to and like (76:07 - 76:10)
i can't imagine just dropping it at this (76:08 - 76:13)
point (76:10 - 76:16)
that's called the sunk cost fallacy wow (76:13 - 76:18)
nah i get like he's made his career off (76:16 - 76:20)
the sunk cost fallacy so yeah that's (76:18 - 76:21)
true that's true (76:20 - 76:23)
plus the added transferring to home is (76:21 - 76:25)
such a huge (76:23 - 76:27)
like if it feels like it it didn't waste (76:25 - 76:29)
my time like i was able to move those (76:27 - 76:30)
over into (76:29 - 76:33)
yeah probably pokemon go honestly so (76:30 - 76:35)
will your defending ranger (76:33 - 76:38)
uh no i i black and white for me (76:35 - 76:41)
honestly for me black and white was the (76:38 - 76:42)
last (76:41 - 76:45)
pokemon game where (76:42 - 76:49)
they tried to include all of the (76:45 - 76:52)
things up to that point (76:49 - 76:56)
and there's no ribbons in black and (76:52 - 76:56)
white (76:56 - 76:58)
they had to cut something out well you (76:56 - 77:00)
can see your ribbons from old games but (76:58 - 77:01)
you can't earn any new ones (77:00 - 77:03)
i don't have never cared about ribbons (77:01 - 77:04)
but they had night and day (77:03 - 77:08)
it had seasons it had and and the (77:04 - 77:10)
seasons actually changed the territory (77:08 - 77:14)
and you just had different battle (77:10 - 77:16)
systems in there and it was just (77:14 - 77:18)
there's so many wonderful things about (77:16 - 77:19)
black and white not (77:18 - 77:23)
i mean i do love x and y quite a bit (77:19 - 77:26)
but it's just like black and white is (77:23 - 77:27)
kind of like if you want to think of (77:26 - 77:27)
like (77:27 - 77:30)
phases of the pokemon games i think (77:27 - 77:33)
black and white was a closing phase (77:30 - 77:36)
of like the first era of pokemon games (77:33 - 77:39)
and why you like black and white so much (77:36 - 77:41)
it's the generation's ultimate before (77:39 - 77:43)
world (77:41 - 77:46)
uh yes yes (77:43 - 77:49)
yes that that uh simile or uh (77:46 - 77:53)
yes that works um i i mean i agree with (77:49 - 77:54)
you i think i think it's very (77:53 - 77:57)
very good i don't know i did like worlds (77:54 - 77:58)
i know you didn't but i liked world a (77:57 - 77:58)
lot (77:58 - 78:02)
black two and white two i i enjoy (77:58 - 78:04)
i why i did not select them is because (78:02 - 78:06)
it's they're just not necessary (78:04 - 78:09)
yeah and the whole coldress story (78:06 - 78:12)
is weird because i pokemon company (78:09 - 78:14)
please explain to me is he a villain or (78:12 - 78:15)
is he he (78:14 - 78:19)
a hero or is is he he is a complicated (78:15 - 78:20)
character i (78:19 - 78:22)
am a coal risk fan why does he get to (78:20 - 78:25)
take vacations in hawaii after he tried (78:22 - 78:25)
to (78:25 - 78:28)
destroy unova by covering it in ice and (78:25 - 78:31)
torturing pokemon doing that for science (78:28 - 78:36)
okay science isn't a crime (78:31 - 78:36)
are we in bioshock now yes there's (78:36 - 78:42)
no no rules except for the progress of (78:40 - 78:44)
man yes yes (78:42 - 78:47)
at the expense right there (78:44 - 78:49)
he also had bad hair would you kindly (78:47 - 78:51)
come to my ship and deal with kites no (78:49 - 78:55)
stop no poor kirim (78:51 - 78:57)
the most pure and beautiful of all (78:55 - 78:59)
pokemon (78:57 - 79:03)
tormented by that horrible man (78:59 - 79:03)
so there you go (79:05 - 79:12)
well pokemon of the week all right last (79:10 - 79:14)
week's pokemon (79:12 - 79:17)
uh i i gave you a list mouse tiny mouse (79:14 - 79:20)
cheering ella squirrel antenna (79:17 - 79:23)
roly-poly yeah roly-poly or two-sided (79:20 - 79:25)
pokemon those are that's the list (79:23 - 79:28)
and then i mentioned a 2012 (79:25 - 79:31)
version of the pokemon in the tcg (79:28 - 79:34)
had call for family which allows you for (79:31 - 79:36)
one colorless energy as an attack (79:34 - 79:38)
you can search for two basic pokemon and (79:36 - 79:40)
put them onto your bench very valuable (79:38 - 79:41)
card (79:40 - 79:44)
if you get it early in the game uh and (79:41 - 79:47)
that's all you needed to know (79:44 - 79:47)
so who's that pokemon (79:49 - 79:52)
it's reggie drago (79:53 - 80:01)
in 2012 in 2012 (79:58 - 80:06)
yes uh look this was two weeks ago i (80:01 - 80:07)
wrote down it's a mulga (80:06 - 80:11)
a moga yes no i'm verifying that my past (80:07 - 80:12)
self was correct (80:11 - 80:15)
you are correct it was imoga uh (80:12 - 80:18)
those uh all those pokemons that i read (80:15 - 80:19)
are all the (80:18 - 80:23)
electric rodent emblematic (80:19 - 80:27)
pokemon from every generation (80:23 - 80:27)
yes and the moga the moga card did (80:27 - 80:30)
feature call for family (80:29 - 80:35)
which if you were playing rey eels (80:30 - 80:38)
was the deck then you could use (80:35 - 80:42)
imoga to call out the eels (80:38 - 80:46)
or the baby rayquaza if that's the card (80:42 - 80:48)
that you needed to play (80:46 - 80:48)
uh pokemon shovel icon is so cute and i (80:50 - 80:53)
think (80:53 - 80:57)
imoga is much maligned in the pokemon (80:53 - 80:57)
cartoon (80:57 - 80:59)
because it's always shown as being like (80:57 - 81:01)
greedy (80:59 - 81:04)
and no imoga's just a sweetie i once had (81:01 - 81:05)
a flying squirrel (81:04 - 81:09)
in my house and it was as a pet or as a (81:05 - 81:11)
visitor accidentally got in there it (81:09 - 81:15)
wasn't supposed to be there (81:11 - 81:18)
uh good (81:15 - 81:22)
good but not great shiny ah (81:18 - 81:23)
i think my next shiny hunt is gonna be (81:22 - 81:25)
imoga i (81:23 - 81:28)
don't need to what are you making (81:25 - 81:31)
squinty eyes at me for (81:28 - 81:31)
do you have a shiny imoga i don't i (81:31 - 81:35)
don't well there you go like a moga's (81:34 - 81:36)
fine i just (81:35 - 81:39)
like to deny and together and those (81:36 - 81:39)
pokemon better (81:39 - 81:43)
yawn big yawn they don't fly (81:39 - 81:46)
sure they pick them up and throw them if (81:43 - 81:48)
they don't they don't (81:46 - 81:51)
anymore trivia (81:48 - 81:51)
for a moga yeah i mean it's been around (81:51 - 81:58)
for 10 years now (81:54 - 82:00)
no there isn't any is it masters i don't (81:58 - 82:01)
think so (82:00 - 82:05)
it's abstract and road time for elisa (82:01 - 82:09)
yeah yeah i don't (82:05 - 82:10)
think i'm trying to think of a mug has (82:09 - 82:14)
ever been in an egg but no (82:10 - 82:14)
uh yeah the trivia is bad moga was first (82:14 - 82:19)
seen in an image on august 7th (82:17 - 82:22)
2010 amolga is the only pokemon with the (82:19 - 82:24)
base stat total of 428. (82:22 - 82:26)
[Music] (82:24 - 82:29)
it may be based on a flying squirrel (82:26 - 82:30)
maybe (82:29 - 82:33)
i think yes all right this week's (82:30 - 82:35)
pokemon (82:33 - 82:38)
here we go number one i have never said (82:35 - 82:40)
that you cannot research these clues (82:38 - 82:42)

great (84:54 - 84:56)

50 bucks instead of (84:56 - 85:01)
